THE  PRESENT  AND  FUTURE  OF  PUBLIC 

SAFETY  COMMUNICATIONS 

THURSDAY,  FEBRUARY  8,  2007 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10:03  a.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Daniel  K.  Inouye, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

The CHAIRMAN. Good morning. Today’s hearing will focus on the 
present and future of public safety communications. This is a mat-
ter  of  continuing  importance  to  our  Nation  and  to  the  men  and 
women  who  risk  their  lives  daily  and  provide  Americans  with 
emergency assistance. 

In  too  many  cities  and  counties  across  this  Nation,  our  Nation’s 
first  providers  struggle  to  talk  to  one  another  during  natural  and 
manmade  disasters.  Unfortunately,  this  problem  is  not  new.  More 
than a decade ago, a specially created Public Safety Wireless Advi-
sory Committee reported on the need for immediate measures to al-
leviate spectrum shortfalls, and promote voice interoperability. 

While we have made significant strides since that time, one need 
only  look  at  our  experience  during  9/11,  or  after  the  Northeast 
blackouts  of  2003,  or  Katrina.  We  know  that  we  have  a  long  way 
to go. 

In  2005,  this  committee  took  an  important  step  by  creating  a 
new  $1  billion  grant  program  to  help  fund  new  equipment  and 
training necessary to improve communications interoperability. Re-
grettably,  our  efforts  to  make  progress  on  this  problem  are  being 
undermined  by  the  Administration,  which  is  using  this  money,  al-
ready in the pipeline, to cover the $1.2 billion cut from the Depart-
ment  of  Homeland  Security  grants  that  support  State  and  local 
preparedness and firefighter assistance. I hope we can do better in 
this regard. 

In  the  110th  Congress,  I  have  begun  by  working  with  my  col-
leagues  Senator  Stevens,  Senator  Kerry,  Senator  Smith,  and  Sen-
ator  Snowe,  by  introducing  this  measure  S.  385,  the  Interoperable 
Emergency Communications Act, which would eliminate current re-
strictions  in  the  law  that  hinders  some  interoperability  efforts  and 
would  provide  the  National  Telecommunications  and  Information 
Administration  with  the  needed  guidance  from  Congress  to  ensure

the money is effectively disbursed. I hope that we move quickly on 
this bill in the coming weeks. 

Today’s hearing will also allow us to peer into the future of pub-
lic safety communications. By now, even the casual observer recog-
nizes  our  broadband  networks  are  changing  the  way  in  which  we 
communicate and exchange information. 

While  we  hate  to  admit  it,  our  children  led  the  way,  using  the 
power of new technology to provide video and real-time information 
to  our  home  and  work  computers,  it  does  not  take  much  imagina-
tion to realize how invaluable these capabilities could be to the first 
on the scene of an emergency. 

My  statement  goes  on  a  little  longer,  but  I  think  we  have  the

I  would  like  to  include  in  the  record  letters  I  received  from  the 

Hawaii Public Safety Committee in support of S. 385. 

[The information referred to follows:] 

CITY AND COUNTY OF HONOLULU FIRE DEPARTMENT 

Honolulu, HI, January 26, 2007 

Hon. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 
Chairman, 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 
Washington, DC. 

Dear Senator Inouye: 
On  February  8,  2007,  the  Senate  Committee  on  Commerce,  Science,  and  Trans-
portation will consider legislation to create a Public Safety Broadband Trust (PSBT). 
As  Fire  Chief  of  the  Honolulu  Fire  Department,  I  support  the  concept  of  creating 
a  nationwide,  broadband  network  for  public  safety  and  ask  that  you  also  support 
this important issue. 

During  emergencies,  fire,  emergency  medical  services,  and  law  enforcement  per-
sonnel  must  have  access  to  the  most  modern  and  reliable  communications  capabili-
ties  in  order  to  communicate  with  each  other  and  with  state  and  Federal  officials. 
The  ability  for  public  safety  to  have  seamless,  nationwide  roaming  capability  on  a 
hardened  and  secure  broadband  network  is  essential  to  meet  our  increased  respon-
sibilities in homeland security. This goal can be met if the public safety community 
has  priority  access  to  a  nationwide,  interoperable,  next  generation,  broadband  net-
work  that  incorporates  the  latest  technologies  such  as  text  messaging,  photos,  dia-
grams,  and  video  not  currently  available  on  existing  public  safety  land  mobile  sys-
tems. 

To  achieve  this  goal,  we  support  legislation  to  create  a  PSBT  to  oversee  manage-
ment  of  this  public/private  network.  The  PSBT  would  hold  the  license  for  30  MHz 
of  broadband  spectrum  in  the  upper  700  MHz  band,  which  is  scheduled  for  auction 
later this year by the Federal Communications Commission. Without legislation, the 
one-time opportunity will be lost for public safety to have access to a broadband net-
work  immediately  adjacent  to  the  already-allocated  24  MHz  of  spectrum  that  will 
become  available  exclusively  for  our  use  in  February  2009.  The  24  MHz  as  well  as 
the  proposed  public/private  broadband  network  are  necessary  in  order  for  public 
safety to meet its future obligations to the public. 

Should  you  have  any  questions  or  comments,  please  call  me.  Thank  you  for  your 

consideration. 

Sincerely, 

KENNETH G. SILVA, 

Fire Chief.

Fire Chief.

Lihu’e, Kaua’i, HI, January 26, 2007 

Hon. DANIEL K. INOUYE,

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 
Today’s  hearing  will  focus  on  the  present  and  future  of  public  safety  communica-
tions. This is a matter of continuing importance to our Nation, and to the men and 
women  who  risk  their  lives  daily  to  provide  Americans  with  emergency  assistance. 
In  too  many  cities  and  counties  across  this  Nation,  our  Nation’s  first  responders 
struggle to talk to one another during natural or manmade disasters. Unfortunately, 
this  problem  is  not  new.  More  than  a  decade  ago,  a  specially-created  Public  Safety 
Wireless  Advisory  Committee  reported  on  the  need  for  immediate  measures  to  al-
leviate spectrum shortfalls and to promote voice interoperability. 

While we have made significant strides since that time, one need only look at our 
experience  during  the  events  of  September  11,  after  the  Northeast  blackouts  in 
2003, and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, to know that we still have a long 
way to go. 

In  2005,  the  Commerce  Committee  took  an  important  step  by  creating  a  new  $1 
billion  grant  program  to  help  fund  new  equipment  and  training  necessary  to  im-
prove  communications  interoperability.  Regrettably  our  efforts  to  make  progress  on 
this  problem  are  being  undermined  by  the  Administration,  which  is  using  this 
money,  already  in  the  pipeline,  to  hide  the  $1.2  billion  cut  from  the  Department  of 
Homeland Security grants that support state and local preparedness and firefighter 
assistance. I hope and trust that Congress can do better in this regard. 

In the 110th Congress, I have begun by working with my colleagues Senators Ste-
vens, Kerry, Smith and Snowe, by introducing S. 385—the Interoperable Emergency 
Communications  Act—which  would  eliminate  current  restrictions  in  the  law  that 
hinder  some  interoperability  efforts  and  would  provide  the  National  Telecommuni-
cations and Information Administration with needed guidance from Congress to en-
sure the money is effectively dispersed. 

I hope that we will move quickly on this bill in the coming weeks. 
Today’s hearing also allows us to peer into the future of public safety communica-
tions.  By  now,  even  the  casual  observer  recognizes  how  broadband  networks  are 
changing the way in which we communicate and exchange information. 

Our children lead the way, using the power of new technology to provide stream-
ing  video  and  real-time  information  to  our  home  and  work  computers,  and  increas-
ingly, to mobile devices on-the-go. It does not take much imagination to realize how 
invaluable  these  capabilities  could  be  to  those  first  on  the  scene  of  an  emergency. 
Such  technology  could  send  streaming  video  to  command  posts  in  the  aftermath 
of  a  hurricane,  could  assess  environmental  conditions  faced  by  firefighters  respond-
ing to a chemical fire, and could transmit the vital signs of injured victims to those 
providing emergency medical assistance. 

To  realize  this  future,  we  must  prepare  for  it.  This  hearing  raises  some  of  the 

most important questions this committee will face: 

• Do we as a nation have a broadband plan for public safety? 
• Do  our  first  responders  have  the  resources,  both  in  spectrum  and  in  funding, 
to  build  and  operate  networks  that  will  enhance  emergency  response  capabili-
ties? 

Now is the time for this discussion. In February 2009, broadcasters will complete 
the  digital  television  transition  and  will  open  significant  amounts  of  new  spectrum 
for commercial and public safety use. Our current plans for the use of that spectrum 
were adopted nearly a decade ago. Given the stakes, it is worth taking a fresh look. 
While some parties, led by large wireless companies with a vested interest in the 
status quo, argue that this discussion will delay the digital television transition, let 
me put that fear to rest. This discussion will not change that date. 

However,  in  the  limited  time  remaining  until  the  planned  auction  of  DTV  spec-
trum  by  January  2008,  it  is  incumbent  on  the  Congress  and  the  Federal  Commu-
nications Commission to understand the needs of our first responders and to ensure

that  we,  as  a  nation,  have  put  in  place  a  plan  that  will  provide  public  safety  with 
the capabilities they need in a broadband world.

STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Senator  STEVENS.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  ap-
plaud  you  for  examining  these  public  safety  issues  very  early.  We 
have  had  a  focus  on  this  subject  for  some  time,  and  I  want  to  join 
you in continuing with that focus. 

This  committee  led  the  way  that  established  the  hard  date  for 
the  transfer  of  the  24  megahertz  of  spectrum  to  public  safety  and 
allocated the $1 billion for interoperability grants last year as part 
of  our  DTV  bill.  The  other  public  safety  issues  addressed  by  our 
committee were the creation of a wireless alert and warning system 
and  the  Tsunami  Warning  System.  We  allocated  $43.5  million  for 
E–911 and $100 million for the National Alert System, and funded 
the Tsunami Warning System. 

Going  forward  now,  I’m  pleased  that  you  have  made  interoper-
ability one of the first bills we’ll introduce this year, and I’m proud 
to  join  you  in  that  regard.  It  will  provide  grant  guidance  for  the 
billion dollars in interoperability grants that we provided last year. 
The funds will drive the public safety community forward in resolv-
ing  the  interoperability  issues  through  planning,  training,  and 
equipment  grants,  as  well  as  establishment  of  technology  reserves 
throughout the country. You have also highlighted the 9-1-1 issues 
and  agreed  to  mark  up  S.  93  next  week.  That  also  provides  ad-
vanced  borrowing  authority  so  the  $43  million  for  the  911  concept 
can  be  distributed  to  public  safety  before  the  DTV  auction  takes 
place. 

The  Cyren  Call  broadband  trust  is  going  to  be  one  of  the  topics 
addressed  here  today.  It  sounds  like  something  good  in  concept, 
and it could be good for public safety. I’ve had a considerable num-
ber of questions raised as to whether this broadband trust proposal 
may  undermine  the  progress  on  the  DTV  transition  and  interoper-
ability  grant  distribution.  They  have  expressed  fear  that  the  pro-
gram  could  undermine  the  funding  we  provided  to  public  safety 
last  Congress.  I  hope  that  we  can  have  an  opportunity  to  examine 
this  now,  and  explore,  with  the  proponents  of  that  concept,  alter-
native models that would not do what these people fear. 

Thank you very much.

STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  thank  you 

both for the work that you’ve done on this important issue. 

I  think  when  we—when  it  comes  to  interoperability,  we  can  all 
agree  on  a  common  goal,  that  our  law  enforcement  personnel 
should  be  able  to  talk  to  each  other.  We  can  agree  on  the  priority 
of  this  goal,  based  on  what  we  saw  after—during  9/11  and  after 
Katrina.  And  I  believe  we  can  agree  on  the  urgency  of  this  goal. 
The question is, What’s the most efficient and effective way to do 
this?  And  I  will  be  coming  to  this  just  from  my  own  experience  as

the  Chief  Prosecutor  in  Hennepin  County,  Minnesota,  which  I  did 
for  8  years,  and  that  includes  1.1  million  people,  which  is  about  a 
fourth  of  the  population  of  our  State,  it’s  Minneapolis  and  45  sub-
urbs.  And  I’m  very  proud  of  the  work  that  we  did  in  our  county, 
and actually the surrounding counties, and it can be a model as we 
look  across  the  country.  Much  of  the  credit  for  this  goes  to  Pat 
McGowan,  my  friend  who’s  the  former  sheriff  of  Hennepin  County 
and, I think, was Sheriff of the Year—right?—and he saw the need 
for interoperability as far back as—to make systems work together 
as  far  back  as  1989.  I  remember  he  noted  that  every  time  the 
President  came  to  town,  we  realized  that  we  couldn’t  talk  to  each 
other. He would always tell me about one case in which a St. Paul 
cop was shot and several different police departments pitched in to 
find  the  killers.  The  helicopter  pilot  assisting  in  the  search  had  to 
carry 12 different portable radios in his helicopter so that he could 
individually  communicate  with  the  different  law  enforcement  peo-
ple  as  this  chase  went  on.  And  so,  that’s  why  he  became  such  a 
strong proponent for a system that connects. 

And  the  end  result,  this  was  actually  before  9/11,  was  that  our 
county had a cost-effective, fully interoperable police safety commu-
nications system, and now, building on that success, the nine coun-
ties that make up the Twin Cities area—it’s almost half the state— 
are all interoperable. 

I  know  we’re  going  to  hear  a  lot  about  spectrum  allocation  and 
the  next  generation  of  communications  technology.  All  these  are 
very important pieces of the interoperability puzzle, and I look for-
ward  to  discussing  them.  But  the  Minnesota  experience  shows  to 
me  two  other  key  challenges—divided  turf  and  limited  funding— 
and the ways to overcome them. Sheriff McGowan always used the 
word  ‘‘moxie’’  to  talk  about  it.  He  talked  about  how  our  local  gov-
ernment had the moxie to allocate dollars to the purpose and to use 
the dollars in an efficient way. And this Congress needs to give in-
centives to promote that kind of moxie nationwide. A key aspect of 
this is support for local law enforcement and firefighters. This year, 
our county is rolling out an upgraded interoperable system that in-
tegrates  data,  as  well  as  voice  communication.  The  system  was 
funded by a COPS program grant. 

I’m  looking  forward  to  this  debate,  but  I  do  think  it  is  very  im-
portant that we use an example that we had in our State. We were 
able  to  get  this  done,  and  I  see  no  reason  that  we  can’t  get  this 
done for the rest of the country. 

Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
The  committee  is  fortunate  to  have  with  us  a  full  panel  of  ex-
perts  and  great  leaders.  We  have  the  Fire  Chief  of  Charlottesville

STATEMENT OF CHARLES L. WERNER, FIRE CHIEF, 

CHARLOTTESVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT; ON BEHALF OF THE 

INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIRE CHIEFS 

Mr. WERNER. Thank you, Chairman Inouye, Vice Chairman—Mr. 

Stevens. Thank you all for the opportunity to be here today. 

My  name  is  Charles  Werner.  I’m  the  Fire  Chief  for  the  City  of 
Charlottesville, Virginia. I also represent the International Associa-
tion of Fire Chiefs’ 12,000 members, and the comments that I make 
today are also representative of the—of APCO, as well. 

Before  I  go  into  this  actual  testimony,  I’d  like  to  thank  both  of 
you  individuals  for  your  leadership  and  the  legislation  that  you’ve 
put  forward  to  help  us  with  the  funding,  defining  it,  for  the  inter-
operability. So, thank you, on that note, first. 

Your  opening  statements  were  interesting,  as  it  leads  into  my 
testimony,  because  you  talk  about  the  much—much  of  the  funds 
that  have  been  put  out  there  in  dollars  on  top  of  dollars,  and  the 
efforts  that  continue  to  be  out  there,  yet  interoperability  continues 
to  plague  us.  And  I  think  that’s  why  today  this  discussion  that 
we’re having on the Public Safety Broadband Trust is so important, 
because  it  is  a  very  forward-thinking  idea  that  takes  us  into  a 
whole  new  direction  that  I  think  economically  will  help  the  fire 
service and public safety in general. 

And America’s public safety agencies support legislation to create 
such  a  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  that  creates  an  opportunity 
with  30  megahertz  of  spectrum.  Important  to  note  that  it’s  not 
going  to  be  just  for  public  safety,  but  for  commercial  entities,  as 
well, and that’ll be an important note of my testimony later. 

Ten years ago or more, the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Com-
mittee  identified  the  needs  of  radio  frequency  spectrum  for  public 
safety. That was again reinforced in a report that followed the Sep-
tember  11th  tragic  incidents  of  terrorism.  That  report  of—after  9/ 
11—also found that radio frequencies allocated to public safety had 
become  highly  congested  in  many  of  the  urban  areas;  second,  the 
ability of agencies within and between jurisdictions to communicate 
with  one  another  is  limited;  and,  third,  the  public  safety  agencies 
lack  the  spectrum  to  implement  advanced  communications  fea-
tures. In addition, the Advisory Committee originally recommended 
that  95.5  megahertz  of  new  spectrum  was  required  to  meet  public 
safety  needs  to  the  year  2011.  To  date,  without  the  help  of  what 
you’ve  done  for  2009,  we  wouldn’t  have  seen  any  of  that  change. 
In the 10 years since that report’s come out, there have also been 
great advances in technology that will help us look in new and ex-
citing  ways,  that  will  give  us  the  ability,  if  we  have  broadband  in 
place, that gives us transmission of video, blueprints, and other in-
formation,  situational  awareness,  fireground  accountability,  bio-
metrics,  enhanced  GIS  mapping  capabilities  for  building  locations, 
critical infrastructure protection, target hazards, hydrant networks, 
transportation systems. You get the point, it goes on and on about 
what’s out there. And some people have said, ‘‘Well, to date, public 
safety  hasn’t  indicated  how  that  is  making  any  difference.  You’re 
not  using  it.’’  It’s  because  it’s  not  affordable  and  dependable  in  a 
way that we can make use of it as we need to.

In order to meet public safety’s communications requirements as 
defined  by  these  dependent—independent  assessments,  Senator 
McCain  has  discussed  and  offered  to  write  legislation  to  establish 
such a broadband trust, and we’re very excited about that. 

One  thing  important  to  note,  this  is  about  the  Public  Safety 
Broadband Trust. It’s not about a Cyren Call proposal, or that com-
pany, it’s about a trust that’s overseen by public safety to help cre-
ate  a  new  network  that  is  viable  for  public  safety  and  funded  by 
commercial effort. 

On  behalf  of  America’s  fire  and  emergency  services,  I  encourage 
Congress  to  take  advantage  of  this  one-time  opportunity—again, 
this very critical one-time opportunity—to create a nationwide pub-
lic safety broadband network. 

As  I  look  back  on  my  own  personal  experience,  much  as  when 
referenced  earlier  about  an  interoperable  system,  in  Charlottes-
ville, Virginia, we have done a similar thing in our region. We have 
created  an  entirely  full  public  safety  interoperable  system.  Four-
teen  million  dollars  and  $500,000  a  year  in  maintenance  fees  is 
what  it  costs  to  put  one  of  these  systems  in  place.  Keep  in  mind, 
as  soon  as  that  system  is  in  place,  it  is  what  it  is,  it  does  not 
evolve,  it  does  not  become  any  better,  it  does  not  create  any  new 
opportunities.  What  that  means  is,  if  we  don’t  change  the  current 
path  that  we’re  on,  we  will  continue  to  spend  millions  upon  mil-
lions—billions  upon  billions  of  dollars  for  systems  that  are  really 
obsolete as soon as they come into operation. Nothing against what 
we  have  in  our  system  today,  but  we’ve  got  to  change  this  para-
digm,  and  the  governments  can’t  continue  to  be  funding  these 
things, as they are. 

This  past  week,  I  also  heard  some  concerning  reports  that  came 
out  that  said  public  safety  doesn’t  need  any  more  spectrum.  Well, 
I’m sorry, all the reports that have looked into this thoroughly dif-
fer  with  that  opinion.  And  I  also  have  a  little  bit  of  frustration 
when people make those statements, and not once have they talked 
to public safety. They also reference—and I’ll be brief, I’m finishing 
up—that we—that these other coalitions have plans for public safe-
ty. Now, up until now, we have heard nothing of these plans, we’ve 
had  no  interactions  with  it.  So,  I  wonder  how  genuine  these  pro-
posals are, and I ask you to look at the opposition to this proposal: 
What’s in it for them, versus what’s in it for us? 

With that, I thank you for the opportunity to speak today. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Werner follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHARLES L. WERNER, FIRE CHIEF, CHARLOTTESVILLE FIRE 

DEPARTMENT; ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIRE CHIEFS 
Good morning Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee. I am Charles Wer-
ner, Fire Chief of the Charlottesville Fire Department in Virginia and a member of 
the  Communications  Committee  of  the  International  Association  of  Fire  Chiefs 
IAFC).  I  am  appearing  today  as  the  representative  of  the  International  Association 
of Fire Chiefs whose 12,000 members represent the leadership of America’s fire and 
rescue  service  from  small,  rural,  volunteer  fire  departments  to  the  large,  urban, 
metropolitan fire departments. Last year America’s fire service responded to over 23 
million fire and emergency calls covering incidents of structure fires, wildland/urban 
interface  fires,  emergency  medical  situations,  hazardous  materials  incidents,  tech-
nical  rescues,  and  natural  disasters.  We  are  prepared,  as  well,  to  respond  to  the 
aftermath of terrorist attacks. I appear today to address a specific and growing com-

munications  need  for  America’s  fire  service—broadband  technology.  Our  testimony 
also reflects the views of the Association of Public-Safety Officials International, Inc. 
Public Safety Spectrum Needs 

At the request of Congress, the National Telecommunications and Information Ad-
ministration  (NTIA)  and  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC)  estab-
lished the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee (PSWAC) to define and docu-
ment  the  critical  need  for  communications  resources  and  the  spectrum  to  support 
public  safety  through  the  year  2010.  The  final  report  was  released  on  September 
11, 1996. Three key problem areas were identified in the report: 

• First,  radio  frequencies  allocated  to  public  safety  had  become  highly  congested 
in many, especially urban, areas. Usable spectrum for mobile operations is lim-
ited  making  it  difficult  to  meet  existing  requirements  much  less  to  plan  for  fu-
ture, more advanced communications needs. 
• Second, the ability of agencies within and between jurisdictions to communicate 
with one another is limited. Yet interoperability is desirable for success in day- 
to-day  operations  as  well  as  larger  scale  operations  in  dealing  with  both  man- 
made and natural disasters. 
• Third, public safety agencies lack the spectrum to implement advanced commu-
nications  features.  A  wide  variety  of  technologies—both  existing  and  under  de-
velopment—hold  substantial  promise  to  reduce  danger  to  public  safety  and 
achieve greater efficiencies in the performance of their duties. Specifically men-
tioned in the 1996 report were broadband data systems, video systems for better 
capabilities  including  use  of  robotics  in  toxic  and  hazardous  environments,  and 
better monitoring and tracking of both personnel and equipment. 

To  implement  the  requirements  identified,  the  advisory  committee  determined 

that more spectrum was required, as follows: 

locations. 

• Immediately, 2.5 MHz of spectrum for interoperability from new or existing al-
• Within 5 years approximately 25 MHz of new public safety allocations are need-
ed. The report suggested using spectrum from television broadcast channels 60– 
69 as soon as possible. 
• Over  the  next  15  years  (e.g.,  through  2011)  as  much  as  an  additional  70  MHz 

will be required to satisfy the mobile communications needs of public safety. 

These  were  the  needs  and  recommendations  addressed  in  the  PSWAC  report  of 
1996.  Then,  in  December  2005  the  FCC  sent  a  Report  to  Congress  on  the  Study  to 
Assess  Short-Term  and  Long-Term  Needs  for  Allocations  of  Additional  Portions  of 
the Electromagnetic Spectrum for Federal, State and Local Emergency Response Pro-
viders.  This  report  was  submitted  pursuant  to  P.L.  108–458,  The  Intelligence  Re-
form  and  Terrorism  Prevention  Act  of  2004.  In  its  conclusion,  the  FCC  stated: 
‘‘First,  as  to  the  operation  and  administration  of  a  potential  nationwide  interoper-
able  broadband  mobile  communications  network  based  upon  input  from  Federal, 
state,  local  and  regional  emergency  response  providers,  emergency  response  pro-
viders  would  benefit  from  the  development  of  an  integrated,  interoperable  nation-
wide network capable of delivering broadband services throughout the country. Sec-
ond,  as  to  the  use  of  commercial  wireless  technologies,  while  commercial  wireless 
technologies and services are not appropriate for every type of public safety commu-
nication,  there  may  now  be  a  place  for  commercial  providers  to  assist  public  safety 
in securing and protecting the homeland.’’ 

For  the  above  stated  reasons,  the  National  Public  Safety  Telecommunications 
Council  [a  resource  and  advocate  for  public  safety  organizations  in  the  United 
States  on  matters  relating  to  public  safety  telecommunications]  has  filed  comments 
with the FCC in support of reallocating 30 MHz of spectrum in the upper 700 MHz 
band,  currently  slated  for  auction,  to  create  a  public/private  nationwide  broadband 
network  to  be  managed  by  public  safety  for  the  benefit  of  public  safety.  The  filing 
states: 

‘‘In  an  era  where  government  preparedness  is  crucial,  there  is  no  nationwide 
public  safety  network  to  manage  and  coordinate  response.  There  is  no  wide 
scale  broadband  technology  capability  to  expedite  analysis  and  information- 
sharing  critical  to  emergency  assistance,  investigation  and  apprehension.  Not 
only  is  the  current  public  safety  spectrum  so  congested  as  to  constrain  voice— 
much less permit broadband use for video and data, limited funding hinders the 
incremental  improvements  that  can  be  made  and  which  are  only  pursued  on  a 
system  by  system  basis.  That  which  is  possible  in  communications  today  and 
what public safety agencies have available reflects an enormous divide. The re-

sult  is  tangible:  slowed  and  hindered  response  across  all  services  which  puts 
lives at risk and property in danger. 
‘‘Although legacy systems will continue to play an important role in public safe-
ty  communications,  the  opportunity  presented  by  the  yet  to  be  auctioned  700 
MHz  channels  is  emphatic.  Without  this  additional  spectrum,  there  can  be  no 
national  public  safety  network  connecting  all  agencies.  Using  broadband  tech-
nologies  to  transmit  information  across  agencies  and  miles  immediately  will  be 
the  exception.  Public  safety  communications  will  come  up  short  in  meeting  its 
challenges.’’ 

The IAFC is a member of the governing board of NPSTC and an active participant 
in  all  of  its  proceedings.  The  IAFC  fully  concurs  with  the  statements  of  support  by 
NPSTC  for  the  establishment  of  a  nationwide,  public/private,  broadband  network 
that will harness the innovative power of the private sector but be managed by pub-
lic safety for the benefit of public safety. 
Public Safety Broadband Requirements 

In 1997, Congress addressed part of the issue of additional spectrum by directing 
the  FCC  to  allocate  24  MHz  in  the  upper  700  MHz  band  for  use  by  public  safety. 
As  a  result  of  the  Deficit  Reduction  Act  (P.L.  109–171),  which  passed  last  year  at 
this time, this spectrum will finally become available for our use in February 2009. 
As was originally intended, it is to provide, for individual licensees, 12 MHz of voice 
channels  and  12  MHz  of  wideband  data  channels.  Fire  and  police  departments  are 
now  in  the  planning  process  of  building  communications  systems  utilizing  this  new 
spectrum. 

Broadband  capability  for  public  safety,  identified  in  the  1996  PSWAC  report,  is 
a  vital  and  growing  need  for  fire  and  police  agencies.  It  is  the  next  step  following 
the allocation and implementation of the 24 MHz designed to alleviate current spec-
trum congestion and provide interoperability. To meet the broadband need for public 
safety, the following requirements are established: 

nationwide network to be affordable for public safety. 

• A nationwide, broadband network covering 99 percent of the population, 65 per-
cent  of  the  land  mass,  most  of  the  critical  infrastructure,  and  a  network  that 
supports urban, suburban and rural communities. 
• A  network  large  enough  to  draw  commercial  support  which  is  requisite  for  a 
• A network built using next-generation technology. 
• A  network  built  to  public  safety  ruggedness  specifications  to  ensure  reliability 
• A network governed by public safety. 
• A network which ensures priority access for public safety. 

under severely adverse conditions. 

Public Safety Uses of Nationwide Broadband Network 

The Public Safety Broadband Trust proposal provides public safety with enormous 

potential that does not currently exist. 

A  hardened  public  safety  network  would  make  possible  nationwide  roaming  and 
interoperability  for  public  safety  agencies  at  the  Federal  (e.g.,  U.S.  Coast  Guard), 
state  (e.g.,  highway  patrol),  and  local  (e.g.,  police,  fire/EMS)  levels.  It  would  give 
public safety access to satellite services where terrestrial services either do not exist 
or  are  temporarily  out  of  service.  The  network  build-out  would  give  rural  areas— 
for the first time—broadband coverage and provide public safety there a communica-
tions  tool  that  would  be  virtually  impossible  because  of  cost  under  any  other  sce-
nario.  In  addition,  this  new  network  will  protect  nuclear  power  plants,  dams,  rail-
roads  and  pipelines  and  other  parts  of  the  Nation’s  critical  infrastructure  in  rural 
areas. 

There are a number of technologies that are available today that fire departments 
would  use—more  will  be  developed,  especially  if  an  affordable  broadband  network 
is available. Some examples are: 

from an incident command post. 

• Transmitting  video,  photographs,  blueprints  and  other  information  both  to  and 
• Advanced  paging  systems  particularly  useful  for  summoning  volunteer  fire-
• Mesh enabled architecture (MEA) for non-GPS broadband location system. 
• Fireground accountability systems—biometrics as well as location. 
• Smart building downloads en route to an alarm.

• Enhanced GIS mapping capability for building locations, critical infrastructure, 

target hazards, water systems, transportation systems, etc. 

• Personal  Area  Networks  linking  a  portable  radio  carried  by  a  firefighter  to 
many  useful  and  lifesaving  accessories  including  a  helmet  video  camera,  video 
viewing  device,  health  monitor,  wireless  self-contained  breathing  apparatus 
(SCBA) microphone and speaker, or a handheld computer. 

• Vehicular  Area  Networks  that  could  link  a  vehicle’s  radio  to  laptop  computers, 

printers, remote headsets, bar code readers, and cameras. 

• Medical video and high-resolution image transmissions from the scene of an in-
cident  to  the  emergency  department  of  a  hospital  where  physicians  can  assess 
patient status and give on-scene and en route treatment instructions. 

• PDAs for fire department leaders or for all firefighters. 

A One-Time Opportunity To Do the Right Thing 

Senator  McCain  has  announced  his  intention  to  introduce  legislation  to  establish 
a Public Safety Broadband Trust. The trust will be composed of public safety organi-
zations  to  hold  a  single  license  for  30  MHz  of  broadband  spectrum  to  create  a  na-
tionwide, public/private broadband network. The trust also will be the management 
group  to  oversee  the  policies,  procedures  and  practices  of  the  network.  In  other 
words,  the  public  safety  trust  will  run  the  network  for  the  benefit  of  public  safety. 
The  30  MHz  of  spectrum  that  is  being  considered  is  immediately  adjacent  to  the 
24  MHz  of  spectrum  allocated  to  public  safety  in  1997,  and  which  will  be  available 
in 2009. This has considerable advantage over any other spectrum since radio com-
munication  devices  can  be  dual  purpose  with  the  spectrum  so  close.  This  spectrum 
in  the  upper  700  MHz  is  also  near  existing  public  safety  which  is  being  relocated 
in the lower 800 MHz band. 

This  30  MHz  of  spectrum  is  currently  slated  for  auction.  The  Deficit  Reduction 
Act  of  2005  requires  the  FCC  to  auction  this  spectrum  by  January  2008.  Without 
legislation taking this out of the auction and allocating it for the public safety trust, 
this one-time opportunity will be lost forever. 
Call for Action 

The  Congress  of  the  United  States  has  a  one-time  opportunity,  in  the  near  term, 
to  provide  public  safety  with  a  nationwide,  broadband  network.  In  order  to  be  af-
fordable for public safety, the network would have to have viable commercial capac-
ity  of  about  30  MHz  of  spectrum.  The  network  would  be  built  to  public  safety  rug-
gedness  specifications.  A  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  would  be  created  to  hold 
the single license from the FCC for the 30 MHz of spectrum and would oversee man-
agement  of  the  network.  While  the  network  volume  would  be  largely  commercial, 
public safety agencies would use what it needed with a built-in priority status. Com-
mercial use also ensures that sufficient capital will be available for maintaining the 
system and upgrading and refreshing newer technologies when they come along. 

We urge the members of this committee to take the first action to create this Pub-
lic  Safety  Broadband  Trust  by  promptly  reporting  legislation  to  take  30  MHz  from 
the  pending  auction  and  direct  the  FCC  to  reallocate  it  to  public  safety.  We  cannot 
suggest  too  strongly  the  urgent  and  identified  need  for  broadband  capability  that 
public  safety  can  use  with  assurance  that  it  will  work  when  needed,  be  available 
when  needed,  and  is  affordable.  With  a  global  war  on  terrorism  being  fought  daily 
and  homeland  security  interest  at  an  all-time  high,  public  safety,  in  defense  of  the 
homeland, should be operating on 21st century technology. Thank you for the oppor-
tunity to address the Committee. We appreciate your consideration of this most im-
portant public safety issue. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Chief. 
May I assure all the witnesses that their full statement and sup-
porting documents and exhibits will all be made part of the record. 

May I now call upon Chairman McEwen? 
Senator  STEVENS.  Mr.  Chairman,  could  you  add  to  this,  this  let-

ter we received from the Coalition? 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Yes,  sir.  Without  objection,  the  letter  will  be 

made part of the record.

COUNCIL FOR CITIZENS AGAINST GOVERNMENT WASTE 

Washington, D.C., February 7, 2007 

Hon. TED STEVENS, 
Vice Chairman, 
U.S. Senate, 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 
Washington, DC. 
Dear Senator, 
Attached  please  find  a  copy  of  a  Federal  Communications  Commission  filing  sub-
mitted on behalf of the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste and the Na-
tional  Taxpayers  Union.  The  filing  expresses  our  concern  regarding  Cyren  Call’s 
proposal  to  reallocate  a  portion  of  the  700  MHz  spectrum.  We  believe  that  the  ill- 
conceived  plan  would  have  resulted  in  an  unprecedented  government  giveaway  and 
a significant setback for taxpayers. 

As you move forward with this issue, please consider the fiscal impact of any leg-
islation and do not undo the digital television (DTV) provisions of the Deficit Reduc-
tion Act passed in last Congress. 

Thank you. 

Sincerely, 

THOMAS A. SCHATZ, 

President. 

NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION, 
COUNCIL FOR CITIZENS AGAINST GOVERNMENT WASTE 

Washington, D.C., November 28, 2006 

Hon. KEVIN J. MARTIN, 
Chairman, 
Federal Communications Commission, 
Washington, DC. 

Dear Chairman Martin: 
On  behalf  of  the  members  of  the  National  Taxpayers  Union  and  the  Council  for 
Citizens  Against  Government  Waste,  we  write  to  commend  your  rejection  of  Cyren 
Call’s proposal to reallocate a portion of the 700 MHz spectrum. We believe that the 
ill-conceived  plan  would  have  resulted  in  an  unprecedented  government  giveaway 
and a significant setback for taxpayers. 

The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 gave 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band 
to  public  safety  causes,  which  effectively  doubled  the  amount  of  spectrum  available 
for emergency communications systems. By providing for the public auction of other 
parts of the 700 z band, the Act encourages the divestiture of excess government as-
sets while promoting a robust, market-driven communications sector. 

Cyren Call’s proposal would have given away for free the additional spectrum that 
could bring in billions of dollars for the Federal Treasury via the time-tested auction 
process.  Past  rounds  of  the  Advanced  Wireless  Services  spectrum  auctions  suggest 
that selling off portions of the 700 MHz spectrum could prove highly lucrative. This 
money  could  he  used  to  decrease  the  budget  deficit,  thereby  reducing  the  bill  that 
taxpayers will ultimately have to settle. 

We  applaud  your  decision  and  stand  ready  to  ensure  that  the  future  allocation 

of the spectrum serves the interests of American taxpayers and businesses alike. 

Sincerely, 

JOHN BERTHOUD, 

President.

CITIZENS AGAINST GOVERNMENT WASTE—CYREN CALL REALITY CHECK, THE WAR ON 

WASTE: CHRONICLES OF WASTE, FRAUD AND ABUSE 

Congressional Alert 
February 6, 2007 

With Congress’s return there is ample opportunity for lobbyists and legislators to 

cause new headaches for taxpayers. 

One  company  in  particular,  Cyren  Call,  is  trying  to  overturn  one  of  the  positive 

actions taken by Congress last year. First, some history is useful. 

In 2004, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted the ‘‘Consensus 
Plan,’’  which  will  realign  the  800  MHz  spectrum  to  separate  public  safety  systems 
from the commercial systems causing interference. 

• Nextel offered to reduce interference by giving up some of its localized 800 MHz 
spectrum,  valued  at  $1.6  billion,  in  exchange  for  nationwide  1.9  GHz  spectrum 
which could have fetched billions more in a public auction. 

• Nextel  received  nearly  a  multi-billion  windfall  at  the  expense  of  taxpayers  and 

possession of valuable spectrum coveted by other communications companies. 

• Nextel has asked for a delay of up to 2 years to complete the 800 MHz realign-

ment. 

Now  the  co-founder  and  several  former  senior  executives  of  Nextel  have  formed 

Cyren Call and are trying to take a second bite out of the taxpayers. 

The  digital  television  (DTV)  provisions  of  the  Deficit  Reduction  Act  of  2005  give 
public safety 24 MHz of prime spectrum in the valuable 700 MHz band and $1 bil-
lion  in  funding  to  help  meet  public  safety’s  needs  for  interoperability  with  the  re-
maining 60 MHz of the spectrum to be auctioned off for taxpayers’ benefit. 

paid to create this new network. 

• Cyren  Call  tried  to  urge  the  FCC  to  give  away  30  MHz  of  the  60  MHz  to  fund 
a  commercial  network  that  would  serve  public  safety.  That  would  only  benefit 
Cyren  Call  and  its  executives  and  financial  backers  at  the  expense  of  public 
safety and U.S. taxpayers. 
• Rather  than  bidding  billions  of  dollars  at  auction,  Cyren  Call  is  hoping  to  be 
• The  company  claims  it  will  make  the  U.S.  Treasury  ‘‘whole’’  with  a  funding 
scheme  for  the  spectrum  but  the  reality  is  that  auctioning  the  spectrum  is  the 
law and the only way to serve taxpayers. 
• The FCC rightfully rejected Cyren Call’s petition and is now looking at how best 
to use the 24 MHz being allocated for public safety consistent with the DTV bill. 
Now  Cyren  Call  is  trying  to  get  Congress  to  take  up  its  plan  and  undo  years 
of work on a carefully crafted compromise. 

Telecommunications spectrum is an asset owned by U.S. taxpayers. Any time this 

asset is given away at no charge, potential revenue is lost. 

Our  first  responders  deserve  to  get  their  24  MHz  as  soon  as  possible  and  tax-
payers  deserve  the  billions  of  dollars  a  spectrum  auction  would  bring  in.  Cyren 
Call’s proposal stands in the way of both and Congress must guard against it. 

A SECURE NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK 
AND THE PUBLIC SAFETY BROADBAND TRUST 

The Nation does not have what it needs most in telecommunications capabilities— 
a  secure  national  mobile  broadband  network  that  meets  the  needs  of  public  safety 
but is also used and supported by the commercial sector. 

In  times  of  national  and  regional  emergency,  the  network  will  provide  the 

broadband communications that are essential to saving life and property. 

During ordinary times, the network will provide truly national and secure commu-
nications  capabilities  to  commercial  users  that  do  not  now  have  such  a  system,  in-
cluding  providers  of  the  critical  infrastructure  on  which  the  Nation’s  livelihood  de-
pends. 

recovered analog spectrum. 

This is how it can be done: 
• Remove  30  MHz  (upper  band)  from  the  upcoming  FCC  auction  of  60  MHz  of 
• Instead of auctioning a license to that 30 MHz spectrum, it should be assigned 
for an appropriate price to a non-profit corporation controlled by national public 
safety organizations—the Public Safety Broadband Trust Corporation (PSBT).

• PSBT  will  lease  spectrum  usage  rights  to  commercial  operators  who  will  build 
out  a  secure  national  broadband  network  meeting  public  safety  specifications. 
• Public safety organizations will control the development of the network in order 
to ensure that it satisfies the requirements and needs of the public safety com-
munity. 
• PSBT will hold and exercise the ultimate control over the license to the 30 MHz 
spectrum  and  will  determine  the  network’s  technology,  build  requirements  and 
the network’s operating rules. 
• Commercial  subscribers  that  need  a  secure  national  network  will  use  the  net-
work  on  a  day-to-day  basis  along  with  public  safety  users  who  will  retain  pri-
ority access to the network. 
• PSBT  will  fund  the  spectrum  acquisition  with  the  lease  payments  of  the  com-
mercial  operators  and  with  the  assistance  of  Federal  loan  guarantees,  just  like 
those that have been made available to other industries (airlines, shipping com-
panies, pipelines). 

The CHAIRMAN. Chief—Mr. Chairman? 

STATEMENT OF HARLIN R. MCEWEN, CHAIRMAN, 

COMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE, IACP; 

COMMUNICATIONS ADVISOR, MCC, NSA, MCSA; 
VICE CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY 

TELECOMMUNICATIONS COUNCIL 

Mr.  MCEWEN.  Thank  you,  sir.  Good  morning.  Thank  you,  Mr. 
Chairman and Mr. Vice Chairman and members of the Committee, 
for the opportunity to speak with you this morning. 

I am the retired Police Chief of the City of Ithaca, New York, and 
I  also  am  a  retired  Deputy  Assistant  Director  of  the  Federal  Bu-
reau  of  Investigation  here  in  Washington,  D.C.  I  serve  as  the 
Chairman  of  the  Communications  and  Technology  Committee  of 
the International Association of Chiefs of Police, a position I’ve held 
for  more  than  28  years.  I  also  serve  as  the  Communications  Advi-
sor for the Major City Chiefs Association, the National Sheriffs As-
sociation,  and  the  Major  County  Sheriffs  Association.  And  in  addi-
tion to these organizations, today I’m speaking on behalf of the As-
sociation  of  Public  Safety  Communications  Officials—International 
and the National Public Safety Telecommunications Council. 

Senator  Klobuchar,  I  want  to  just  make  the  point  that  I’ve 
known  Sheriff  McGowan  for  many  years.  He’s  a  wonderful  profes-
sional.  We’re  going  to  miss  him,  now  that  he’s  retired.  But  I 
worked  closely  with  him  in  these  matters  of  interoperability,  so  I 
know what you speak of. 

I’m  pleased  to  have  the  chance  to  discuss  with  the  Committee 
today  an  exciting  new  opportunity  for  Congress  to  take  steps  that 
will  pave  the  way  to  reduce  the  dependence  on  local  and  Federal 
tax  revenues  to  maintain  modern  public  safety  communications 
systems. That is a proposal for a 700-megahertz nationwide public- 
safety broadband network. This proposed network can become a re-
ality  only  if  Congress  authorizes  creation  of  a  public/private  part-
nership controlled by the public safety community to hold a nation-
wide  license  for  30  megahertz  of  spectrum  in  the  upper  700  mega-
hertz  band;  and  to  further  authorize  us,  the  public  safety  commu-
nity, to deploy this network, pursuant to a public-sector/private-sec-
tor  partnership  model.  The  wireless  voice  systems  public  safety 
personnel use today are among the most important tools they have 
to  do  their  job  in  a  safe  and  efficient  manner.  However,  these  sys-
tems  have,  in  many  cases,  been  underfunded,  poorly  maintained,

and generally not refreshed. As we look to the long-term future, we 
need to look at a new and better way to improve public safety com-
munications. 

The implementation of a nationwide public-safety broadband net-
work can be the beginning of the end to the problem of public safe-
ty  interoperability.  We  have  been  asking  for  funding  support  for 
years  to  help  us  upgrade  and  replace  mission-critical  land  mobile 
voice  systems  that  are  built  by  different  manufacturers,  are  of  dif-
ferent vintages, are generally incompatible, and, in many cases, not 
compatible  with  the  P25  standards,  which  are  the  only  recognized 
national digital standards for land mobile public safety communica-
tions interoperability. 

For those who argue that public safety already has enough radio 
spectrum to meet current and projected mobile requirements, I can 
only  say  that  they  purposely  ignore  the  facts  concerning  public 
safety spectrum allocations and first-responder communications re-
quirements.  As  an  example,  the  cellular  industry,  represented  by 
CTIA,  has  grossly  misrepresented  the  spectrum  issue.  CTIA  re-
cently  said,  ‘‘Right  now,  the  public  service  community  utilizes  47 
megahertz of spectrum to serve its public safety users. At the same 
time, there are wireless carriers that use roughly the same amount 
of  spectrum  to  deliver  voice,  data,  and  advanced  information  serv-
ices  to  many  times  that  number  of  subscribers.’’  Contrary  to  what 
the  CTIA  says,  the  real  facts  on  spectrum  allocations  are  that  the 
commercial  allocations  for  wireless  communications  add  up  to  528 
megahertz,  an  amount  more  than  ten  times  that  for  public  safety. 
In  regard  to  the  ninth  notice  of  proposed  rulemaking  recently 
issued by the Federal Communications Commission, we have many 
concerns  about  the  concept  set  forth  in  that  proposal.  The  ninth 
NPRM  suggests  that  a  nationwide  broadband  network  could  be 
built  using  the  12  megahertz  of  spectrum  currently  allocated  for 
local  licensing  of  public  safety  wideband  systems.  This  would  take 
away  from  local  licensing  control  the  spectrum  long  promised  for 
use  by  local  agencies.  In  addition,  we  believe  that  the  proposal  is 
seriously  flawed  by  failing  to  acknowledge  the  need  for  enough 
spectrum to attract investors to participate in a public/private part-
nership  where  private  funds  would  be  invested  to  build  a  nation-
wide network. 

And, Senator Klobuchar, I want to make mention of the fact that 
in  Hennepin  County,  three  counties  partnering  with  Hennepin 
County,  for  instance,  are  building  a  wideband  system  that  would 
be in jeopardy if that particular proposal were to be followed. 

I  have  dedicated  most  of  my  professional  career  to  the  advance-
ment of public safety communications. From that perspective, I be-
lieve  this  Congress  has  an  extraordinary  time-sensitive  oppor-
tunity.  Approval  of  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  and  a  pub-
lic/private-sector partnership will catapult public safety to its right-
ful place in the forefront of communications capability while at the 
same  time  delivering  broadband  service  to  communities  that  con-
tinue to be bypassed by the commercial telecommunications indus-
try. I hope you will share my belief that this is an opportunity that 
must be seized for the benefit of the entire public. 

Thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HARLIN R.  MCEWEN,  CHAIRMAN,  COMMUNICATIONS AND 
TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE,  IACP;  COMMUNICATIONS ADVISOR,  MCC,  NSA,  MCSA; 
VICE CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY TELECOMMUNICATIONS COUNCIL 
Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  distinguished  members  of  the  Committee  for  the 

opportunity to appear before you today. 

My  name  is  Harlin  McEwen  and  I  have  been  actively  involved  in  public  safety 
for  almost  50  years.  My  career  has  been  in  law  enforcement  and  I  also  have  been 
a volunteer firefighter. I am the retired Police Chief of the City of Ithaca, New York, 
and am also retired as a Deputy Assistant Director of the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation in Washington, D.C. I serve as Chairman of the Communications and Tech-
nology Committee of the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), a posi-
tion I have held for more than 28 years. I also serve as the Communications Advisor 
for  the  Major  Cities  Chiefs  Association  (MCC),  the  National  Sheriffs’  Association 
(NSA),  and  the  Major  County  Sheriffs’  Association.  I  am  the  Vice  Chairman  of  the 
National  Public  Safety  Telecommunications  Council  (NPSTC)  and  am  a  Life  Mem-
ber  of  the  Association  of  Public-Safety  Communications  Officials-International 
(APCO). Today I speak on behalf of all of these organizations. 

When  I  first  became  a  law  enforcement  officer  in  1957,  police  vehicles  had  tube 
type  6  volt  analog  mobile  radios  that  dimmed  the  headlights  when  we  pushed  the 
microphone  button.  In  those  days  there  were  no  hand-held  radios.  In  my  career  I 
have  witnessed  many  changes  and  advances  in  law  enforcement  and  public  safety 
communications.  However,  the  advances  for  public  safety  have  consistently  lagged 
behind  the  advances  of  commercial  services,  primarily  because  of  lack  of  funding 
and spectrum. 

As you are aware, citizens rely upon their local and state police agencies, sheriffs’ 
offices, fire departments, emergency medical services, and other emergency services 
like  highway  and  public  works  and  utilities  to  come  to  their  assistance  wherever 
and  whenever  needed.  They  respond  whether  it  is  a  crime  in  progress,  a  civil  dis-
turbance,  a  building  fire,  a  forest  fire,  an  automobile  accident,  a  health  emergency, 
a  natural  disaster,  or,  as  we  learned  on  9/11,  a  terrorist  attack.  Today,  citizens  as-
sume that those first responders will get the call and will have the communications 
tools  they  need  to  address  emergencies  quickly  and  efficiently.  Unfortunately  that 
is not always true. 

I  want  to  applaud  the  efforts  of  this  Committee  and  the  Congress  in  voting  to 
clear  the  television  broadcasters  from  the  long  promised  700  MHz  spectrum.  This 
will help us improve public safety radio communications, both operability and inter-
operability. The major cities and metropolitan areas of this country are still in des-
perate  need  of  additional  land  mobile  voice  channels  and  are  anxiously  waiting  for 
this spectrum to become available. Your efforts to designate $1 billion derived from 
the  auction  of  radio  spectrum  for  public  safety  communications  are  also  very  much 
appreciated  by  the  public  safety  community  and  will  be  very  helpful.  The  introduc-
tion of S. 385 by Senators Inouye, Stevens, Kerry, Smith, and Snowe is also helpful 
in giving direction to NTIA with respect to the $1 billion grant program and we ap-
preciate these efforts to have this funding program implemented in a timely fashion. 
I  am  pleased  to  have  the  chance  to  discuss  with  this  Committee  an  exciting  new 
opportunity  for  Congress  to  take  steps  that  will  pave  the  way  to  reducing  the  de-
pendence  on  local  and  Federal  tax  revenues  to  maintain  modern  public  safety  com-
munications  systems.  That  is  a  proposal  for  a  700  MHz  nationwide  public  safety 
broadband  network.  This  proposed  network  can  become  a  reality  only  if  Congress 
authorizes  creation  of  a  public/private  partnership,  controlled  by  the  public  safety 
community,  to  hold  a  nationwide  license  for  30  MHz  of  spectrum  in  the  upper  700 
MHz band and further authorize us to deploy this network pursuant to a public sec-
tor-private sector partnership model. 

I  have  studied  the  issue  of  public  safety  telecommunications  for  decades.  I  have 
been  actively  engaged  in  the  efforts  of  the  Federal  Communications  Commission, 
other  Federal  agencies,  state  and  local  government  entities  and  individual  depart-
ments  to  identify  law  enforcement  communications  requirements  and  provide  our 
first responders with the necessary tools to meet those needs. Substantial time and 
significant taxpayer dollars have been devoted to those efforts, yet in 2007 the pub-
lic  safety  community  still  is  far  behind  commercial  users  in  terms  of  wireless 
functionality. Our public safety users who should have the best, most advanced, and 
most robust capabilities too often must rely on systems that are inadequate for their 
needs  today,  much  less  the  expanded  responsibilities  with  which  they  will  continue 
to be charged in the future. Without a fundamental change in the way we approach 
emergency  responder  communications,  specifically  without  allocation  of  the  addi-
tional  30  MHz  of  spectrum  and  adoption  of  the  approach  embodied  in  the  Public

Safety Broadband Trust (PSBT) proposal, I see no reason to ever expect substantial 
improvement. 

The wireless voice systems public safety personnel use today are among the most 
important  tools  they  have  to  do  their  job  in  a  safe  and  efficient  manner.  However, 
these  systems  have  in  many  cases  been  underfunded,  poorly  maintained  and  gen-
erally  not  refreshed.  As  we  look  to  the  long  term  future,  we  need  to  look  at  new 
and better ways to improve public safety communications. 

The  need  for  more  efficient  public  safety  data  systems  is  growing  and  this  has 
become  the  focus  of  much  of  our  attention  as  we  look  to  ways  for  public  safety  to 
take  advantage  of  Third  Generation  (3G)  and  Fourth  Generation  (4G)  technologies. 
The implementation of a nationwide public safety broadband network can also be 
the  beginning  of  the  end  to  the  problem  of  public  safety  interoperability.  We  have 
been  asking  for  funding  support  for  years  to  help  us  upgrade  and  replace  mission 
critical  land  mobile  voice  systems  that  are  built  by  different  manufacturers,  are  of 
different  vintages,  are  generally  incompatible  and  in  many  cases  not  compatible 
with the P25 standards, the only recognized national digital standards for land mo-
bile public safety communications interoperability. 

It is critical to understand that this is a one-time-only opportunity to solve many 
of the public safety communications requirements of today and the future. We recog-
nize this is not an easy decision for the Congress. You must choose between solving 
the  public  safety  communications  problem  and  making  sure  our  citizens  have  good 
public  services,  or  allowing  the  spectrum  required  by  public  safety  to  be  auctioned 
to commercial companies who want to expand their services and increase their prof-
its.  It  seems  simple  to  us  that  by  your  approval  of  this  important  step  for  public 
safety you will be doing the right thing for America. It will begin to take the burden 
off the taxpayers who must build and maintain increasingly expensive public safety 
communications systems. 

The  benefits  from  a  nationwide  public  safety  broadband  network  as  set  forth  in 

the Public Safety Broadband Trust proposal are as follows: 

1.  Broadband  data  services  (such  as  text  messaging,  photos,  diagrams,  and 
streaming  video)  not  currently  available  in  existing  public  safety  land  mobile 
systems. 
2. A hardened public safety network with infrastructure built to withstand local 
natural hazards (tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, etc.) that would in-
clude  strengthened  towers  and  back-up  power  with  fuel  supplies  to  withstand 
long-term outages of public power sources. 
3.  Nationwide  roaming  and  interoperability  for  local,  state,  and  Federal  public 
safety  agencies  (police,  fire  and  EMS)  and  other  emergency  services  such  as 
transportation, health care, and utilities. 
4.  Access  to  the  Public  Switched  Telephone  Network  (PSTN)  similar  to  current 
commercial cellular services. 
5. Push-to-talk, one-to-one and one-to-many radio capability that would provide 
a back-up to (but not replace) traditional public safety land mobile mission crit-
ical voice systems. 
6.  Access  to  satellite  services  to  provide  reliable  nationwide  communications 
where  terrestrial  services  either  do  not  exist  or  are  temporarily  out  of  service. 
For  those  who  argue  that  public  safety  already  has  enough  radio  spectrum  to 
meet current and projected mobile requirements, I can only say that they purposely 
ignore  the  facts  concerning  public  safety  spectrum  allocations  and  first  responder 
communications requirements. As an example, the cellular industry, represented by 
CTIA,  has  grossly  misrepresented  the  spectrum  issue  as  recently  exhibited  in  their 
press  release  critical  of  Senator  McCain’s  announcement  that  he  would  be  intro-
ducing  legislation  to  establish  a  new  nationwide,  state-of-the-art  public  safety 
broadband  network.  The  CTIA  statement  said  ‘‘the  basic  facts  of  the  matter  should 
compel  this  important  debate  to  be  about  providing  first  responders  with  funding, 
access  to  equipment  and  coordination,  not  more  spectrum’’.  CTIA  further  stated 
‘‘Right  now,  the  public  service  community  utilizes  47  MHz  of  spectrum  to  serve  its 
public  safety  users.  At  the  same  time,  there  are  wireless  carriers  that  use  roughly 
the same amount of spectrum to deliver voice, data and advanced information serv-
ices to many times that number of subscribers. More spectrum is clearly not the an-
swer’’. 

Contrary  to  what  the  CTIA  says,  the  REAL  facts  on  spectrum  allocations  are  as

But  even  these  numbers  do  not  tell  the  real  story  or  explain  why  existing  public 
safety  allocations  cannot  be  used  for  broadband  operations.  Historically,  the  FCC 
has  allocated  individual  channels,  not  contiguous  channel  blocks,  for  public  safety 
use. These channels are immediately adjacent to channels allocated for taxicab com-
panies,  truck  operators  and  other  businesses.  The  channels  typically  are  no  larger 
than  25  kHz  bandwidth  and  more  frequently  12.5  kHz,  or  a  tiny  fraction  of  each 
25  MHz  cellular  system  authorization.  This  allocation  approach  has  permitted  nu-
merous  governmental  entities  to  secure  licenses  for  localized,  individual  purposes, 
but  precludes  the  public  safety  community  as  a  whole  from  consolidating  enough 
contiguous  channels  to  deploy  21st  century  broadband  technology  networks.  There 
simply  is  not  sufficient  contiguous  bandwidth  to  support  the  text  messaging,  build-
ing diagrams, photos, streaming video and other transmissions that will be as essen-
tial  to  law  enforcement  officers  during  these  perilous  times  as  the  weapons  they 
carry. 

While  the  24  MHz  public  safety  allocation  in  the  upper  700  MHz  band  is  contig-
uous,  even  that  spectrum  is  subdivided  in  various  categories  designed  for  mission 
critical voice communications on both localized and state levels, as well as for wide-
band  data  applications.  And  that  spectrum  allocation,  first  promised  to  the  public 
safety community in 1997, was intended to address the unmet needs and identified 
deficiencies in the spectrum resources available to public safety more than a decade 
ago. New technologies and new services have since been developed to respond to the 
ever  escalating  commercial  appetite  for  more  useful  and  sophisticated  mobile  com-
munications  tools  and  solutions—and  appropriate  new  commercial  spectrum  alloca-
tions have been made available to commercial network operators to bring those im-
provements to their customers. Likewise, over the past decade, public safety’s needs 
for access to these advanced technologies, services, tools and solutions has not stood 
still—although,  unfortunately,  the  amount  of  appropriate  spectrum  allocated  to 
meet them has. 

Allow me to emphasize these points by example, as the contrast between the spec-
trum resources available to commercial wireless network operators and to the public 
safety  community  could  not  be  more  striking.  To  begin  with,  commercial  cellular 
and PCS licensees have access to large blocks of contiguous spectrum. Their alloca-
tions  were  specifically  designed  to  support  system  architectures  and  technologies 
that would accommodate vast numbers of customers. To compare the number of sub-
scribers that can be served on a 25 MHz cellular network with the number of police 
officers  that  can  share  a  12.5  kHz  bandwidth  channel,  or  even  multiple  channels, 
is as meaningful as comparing the size of watermelons to grapes. Compounding the 
imbalance  is  the  absolute  amount  of  spectrum  that  has  been  made  available  for 
commercial  use  in  comparison  to  that  which  has  been  made  available  for  public 
safety uses as detailed above. Just last year, the Commission made another 90 MHz 
of  spectrum  of  Advanced  Wireless  Spectrum  available  for  commercial  operations,

again  in  large  spectrum  blocks  and  expressly  authorized  for  commercial  mobile 
broadband uses. 

In fact, it is the success of the cellular/PCS model that has convinced us that pub-
lic safety must have a 30 MHz spectrum block on which to deploy an advanced tech-
nology broadband network. That model has persuaded us that the public safety com-
munity must join together in the Public Safety Broadband Trust, rather than seek-
ing  individual  licenses  for  individually  designed  and  deployed  systems,  if  we  are  to 
achieve  our  objective:  seamless  nationwide  roaming  capability  on  a  21st  century 
broadband  700  MHz  network  that  is  built  and  operated  to  satisfy  increasing  and 
demanding public safety requirements. 

I  stated  previously  that  a  nationwide  broadband  network  solution  needed  to  ad-
dress  both  spectrum  and  funding,  and  to  address  them  both  at  the  same  time  and 
in the same context. The latter is just as critical as the former and requires an inno-
vative  approach  given  the  extraordinary  costs  associated  with  building  and  oper-
ating  a  truly  nationwide  broadband  network.  Unlike  purely  commercial  systems 
that  have  the  luxury  of  limiting  coverage  to  areas  of  denser  population  and  trans-
portation  corridors,  public  safety  users  must  have  communications  capability  wher-
ever  there  are  people  or  property  to  protect.  This  mandate  has  the  important  con-
sumer benefit of ensuring that a broadband network designed to meet public safety 
needs will be available in suburban and rural communities that remain outside the 
areas of commercial broadband deployment. However, I have substantial experience 
in the traditional funding sources for public safety communications and see no real-
istic  possibility  that  the  necessary  moneys  will  be  made  available  even  to  build, 
much  less  maintain,  operate  and  routinely  upgrade  a  network  of  this  scope  if  dedi-
cated to purely public safety requirements. 

The only solution that we consider viable is a public sector-private sector partner-
ship  as  proposed  in  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust.  Under  this  approach,  the 
PSBT  would  acquire  a  30  MHz  license  at  700  MHz  and  would  enter  into  leases  of 
spectrum  usage  rights  with  commercial  operators  who  would  build  a  nationwide 
public safety network that: (1) would be paid for by commercial operators using ex-
cess  capacity,  not  by  the  public  safety  community  or  the  taxpayer;  (2)  would  be  li-
censed  and  controlled  by  public  safety  representatives  to  ensure  public  safety  pri-
ority  access;  and  (3)  would  be  refreshed  with  the  latest  technical  improvements, 
funded by the commercial participants. 

We  do  not  support  what  some  would  call  a  ‘‘hosted’’  public  safety  network.  While 
the  term  may  have  somewhat  different  meanings  to  different  people,  at  its  core  it 
puts  mission  critical,  emergency  response  communications  in  a  position  of  depend-
ence with respect to the host commercial provider. Moreover, it undermines or even 
negates  the  essential  nationwide  character  of  the  network.  With  all  due  respect  to 
commercial  operators  that  might  now  express  support  for  hosted  systems,  there  is 
nothing in the over 20-year history of commercial wireless systems that would vali-
date  their  reliability  or  availability  for  mission  critical  public  safety  needs.  That  is 
not an arrangement that the public safety community could endorse. 

In  regard  to  the  Ninth  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  (NPRM)  recently  issued 
by the Federal Communications Commission, we have many concerns about the con-
cepts  set  forth  in  that  proposal.  The  Ninth  NPRM  suggests  that  a  nationwide 
broadband network could be built using the 12 MHz of spectrum currently allocated 
for  local  licensing  of  public  safety  wideband  systems.  This  would  take  away  from 
local licensing control the spectrum long promised for use by local agencies. In addi-
tion  we  believe  the  proposal  is  seriously  flawed  by  failing  to  acknowledge  the  need 
for  enough  spectrum  to  attract  investors  to  participate  in  a  public/private  partner-
ship where private funds would be invested to build a nationwide network. 

By  contrast,  the  partnership  outlined  in  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  cre-
ates  a  symbiotic  and  balanced  relationship,  but  one  in  which  public  safety  always 
remains in control. It represents a win-win opportunity if sufficient spectrum is allo-
cated to accommodate both public safety and commercial usage. Public safety cannot 
fund  this  network  on  its  own,  but  also  must  be  confident  that  the  network  is  built 
to  hardened  public  safety  requirements  with  priority  access  that  is  adequate  to  re-
spond  to  emergencies.  Commercial  operators  will  lease  the  spectrum  and  build  the 
network to public safety specifications, but only if there is sufficient excess capacity 
to permit meaningful commercial service on a regular basis. The technical data sup-
ports  the  conclusion  that  a  minimum  of  30  MHz  is  needed  to  serve  these  com-
plementary requirements. 

The many public safety organizations and agencies that have supported the PSBT 
approach  recognize  that  it  will  require  removing  some  of  the  700  MHz  spectrum 
that  currently  is  scheduled  to  be  auctioned.  The  PSBT  proposal  includes  a  plan  to 
make  the  Federal  budget  whole.  The  PSBT  would  raise  $5  billion  to  pay  the  U.S. 
Treasury  for  the  spectrum,  using  the  revenues  from  the  commercial  users  and  the

20 

assistance  of  Federal  loan  guarantees  similar  to  those  that  have  been  made  avail-
able to industries such as airlines, pipelines and automobile manufacturers. This fi-
nancing arrangement would ensure that other Federal public safety spending prior-
ities,  including  the  $1  billion  for  other  public  safety  interoperable  communications 
needs, would not be affected. 

Let  me  add  that  I  and  other  supporters  of  the  PSBT  also  endorse  the  commend-
able  work  being  done  by  local  and  regional  organizations  such  as  the  Capitol  Area 
Region  Broadband  Project  with  respect  to  broadband.  To  the  extent  their  efforts 
bring  about  public  safety  communications  improvements,  it  is  important  work  that 
deserves  support.  But  we  must  remain  mindful  that  the  results  will  be,  at  best,  a 
patchwork of improved, but incompatible, non-interoperable networks at a daunting 
per unit cost. They are doing what they can in light of the regulatory and financial 
environment  in  which  they  must  operate,  but  this  Nation  can  and  must  do  better. 
I have dedicated most of my professional career to the advancement of public safe-
ty  communications.  From  that  perspective,  I  believe  this  Congress  has  an  extraor-
dinary  time-sensitive  opportunity.  Approval  of  the  PSBT  and  the  public  sector-pri-
vate  sector  partnership  will  catapult  public  safety  to  its  rightful  place  in  the  fore-
front  of  communications  capability  while  at  the  same  time  delivering  broadband 
service  to  communities  that  continue  to  be  bypassed  by  the  commercial  tele-
communications  revolution.  I  hope  you  will  share  my  belief  that  this  is  an  oppor-
tunity that must be seized for the benefit of the entire American public. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much. 
May I now call upon Mr. O’Brien, Chairman of Cyren Call. 
Mr. O’Brien? 

STATEMENT OF MORGAN O’BRIEN, CHAIRMAN, 

CYREN CALL COMMUNICATIONS 

Mr.  O’BRIEN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Vice 

Chairman and members of the Committee. 

My  name  is  Morgan  O’Brien,  and  I  am  no  stranger  to  con-

troversy. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr.  O’BRIEN.  In  1987,  I  was  a  founder  of  a  company  then  called 
Fleet  Call,  which  became  Nextel.  And  the  relevance  of  the  history 
of  my  experience  and—at  Fleet  Call  and  Nextel—to  today’s  delib-
eration  is  that  Fleet  Call  and  Nextel  approached  the  FCC  and  ar-
gued  strenuously  that  a  more  efficient  use  of  spectrum,  a  different 
way  of  handling  spectrum,  would  create  a  competitive  opportunity 
to the cellular industry that was a duopoly. It would be fair to say 
that  the  response  in  1987  from  the  established  cellular  industry, 
the  wireless  operations,  and  the  wireless  carriers,  was  violent.  I 
understand  well  the  process  of  innovation  and  introducing  disrup-
tive technology into an existing environment. 

I  think  the  success  that  Nextel  accomplished  illustrates  vividly 
the  point  that  competition,  as  opposed  to  competitors,  is  the  guid-
ing  principle  in  the  regulation  of  telecommunications.  I  know  I’m 
preaching  to  the  converted  when  I  talk  about  competition  to  this 
committee,  but  the  history  of  Nextel—which,  for  18  years,  I  lived 
intimately—was  that  new  competition  and  disruptive  technology 
are never welcome, but they have a very beneficial effect. 

At Nextel I also developed a high degree of confidence for the pri-
vate  sector—the  willingness  of  the  private  sector  to  capitalize  new 
ventures  and  the  ability  of  a  new  venture  such  as  Nextel  to  take 
on  the  establishment,  build  up  market  share,  and  be  a  long-time 
successful  operation.  I  know  that  process.  I  know  the  elements. 
And I believe I see the same opportunity here.

21 

Prior  to  the  Nextel  experience,  and,  in  a  certain  way,  a  return 
for  me  to  my  roots,  I  had  the  privilege  of  working  at  the  Federal 
Communications  Commission  in  the  1970s,  working  in  the  area  of 
spectrum  management  of  private  radio  services,  the  key  player  in 
the private radio services being public safety. So, I began my career 
working for several years at the FCC, working on the same thorny 
issue  that  we’re  talking  about  today,  and  that  was  in  the  1970s. 
Spectrum management is a more rational way of using and assign-
ing  frequencies  for  the  most  important  users  of  radio  communica-
tions frequencies, which is public safety. 

The  details  of  the  proposal  that  Cyren  Call  has  put  forward  to 
this  committee  and  to  the  FCC  are  set  out  in  my  testimony  and 
others,  so  I  won’t  take  the  time  to  go  through  the  details  now.  I 
just want to make one or two points of emphasis. 

By  far  the  most  important  element  of  our  proposal  is  that  30 
megahertz  of  spectrum  be  licensed  to  a  not-for-profit  Public  Safety 
Broadband  Trust  broadly  representative  of  the  public  interest— 
public  safety  interest  at  State,  local,  and  Federal  levels—through-
out  this  country.  I  want  to  stress  the  implications  of  having  that 
type  of  a  licensee,  something  never  before  attempted,  and  the  dif-
ference  of  a  non-profit  oriented  license.  The  not-for-profit  licensee 
would  be  sufficiently  instructed  by  legislation  and  by  the  FCC  to 
achieve  certain  objectives  not  in  the  commercial  interest,  but  in-
stead  in  the  public  interest.  For  example,  providing  the  broadest 
possible  coverage,  even  when  the  broadest  possible  coverage  isn’t 
the most economically rational thing to do. Providing a public-safe-
ty-grade  build-out  would  not  be  economically  rational  but  for  a  li-
censee such as the Public Safety Broadband Trust. 

So,  I  draw  your  attention  to  the  importance  of  awarding  a  li-
cense, figuring out a way to make that license available to the Pub-
lic  Safety  Broadband  Trust,  and  then  following  through  the  impli-
cations—the  powerful  implications—of  how  that  type  of  licensee, 
working  with  the  private  sector—again,  something  unprece-
dented—can  use  the  private  sector  and  the  willingness  of  the  pri-
vate sector to finance a next-generation network. 

I’d  like  to  make  a  last  point—actually  there  are  two  last  points. 
One, any effect of our proposal, or proposals like our proposal, that 
would delay the availability of spectrum based on the earlier legis-
lation,  in  our  view,  would  be  a  terrible  mistake.  Anything  that 
would  affect  the  billion  dollars  that’s  available—or  will  be  coming 
available  to  public  safety  interoperability—again,  would  be  a  ter-
rible mistake. No one at Cyren Call in any way would support that. 
So,  if  that  were  the  unfortunate  consequence,  and  a  choice  had  to 
be  made,  the  clear  choice  is  not  to  affect  those  deadlines.  That 
would be counter to the best interest of public safety and the public 
interest. 

I  want  to  say  one  final  word  about  three  aspects  of  competition. 
First and foremost, the disruptive and positive effect of a new play-
er  coming  into  the  wireless  industry  at  this  point  of  time,  I  think, 
cannot  be  exaggerated.  Competition  is  important,  and  protecting 
competitors  is  not  important,  as  has  been  so  often  the  case  before. 
Secondly,  the  use  of  competition  is  important.  If  a  Public  Safety 
Broadband Trust is created, to recruit and develop the best possible 
range  of  commercial  operators  to  partner  with  public  safety  under 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:58 Oct 06, 2010 Jkt 039473 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39473.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

22 

the  guidance  of  public  safety,  the  use  of  competition  will  be  effec-
tive. And, third, and most painfully and most personally, I want to 
address  the  competition  for  the  role  that  Cyren  Call  has  sought. 
We  are  absolutely  consistent  with  the  logic  of  the  Public  Safety 
Broadband Trust making the right decision, looking fully and com-
petitively to determine who would be the best partner, and the best 
manager in this type of relationship. We’re prepared to go through 
that process. We would hope to win in that process. But, again, we 
look at the competition. 

And I thank you very much, and I hope to have a chance to talk 

more in the questions. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. O’Brien follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MORGAN O’BRIEN, CHAIRMAN, 

CYREN CALL COMMUNICATIONS 

Good  morning  Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens,  members  of  the  Com-
mittee. My name is Morgan O’Brien. I am the Chairman of Cyren Call Communica-
tions  Corporation.  Prior  to  forming  Cyren  Call  last  year,  I  spent  eighteen  years  as 
a  founder  of  Nextel  Communications,  Inc.  I  served  most  recently  as  Vice  Chairman 
of Nextel prior to its merger with Sprint Corporation. 

Historically,  Congress  and  the  FCC  have  treated  the  communications  require-
ments of the public safety and commercial communities as separate and distinct. As 
a  result,  public  safety  increasingly  has  been  left  behind  while  commercial  service 
providers have revolutionized the telecommunications capabilities of the Nation. The 
challenge before us today is how to correct this imbalance, since 9/11 taught us that 
we  are  all  one  nation  facing  a  new  threat.  To  meet  this  threat,  public  safety  must 
have  the  same  extraordinary  capabilities  that  consumers  already  are  beginning  to 
enjoy on commercial broadband networks. 

The  Nation’s  emergency  response  providers  are  being  asked  to  take  on  ever  ex-
panded  duties  with  limited  human  and  financial  resources.  Improved  technology  is 
key  to  enabling  that  workforce  to  keep  pace  with  those  responsibilities.  This  Com-
mittee  has  repeatedly  recognized  the  importance  of  broadband  for  the  general  pub-
lic.  The  Nation’s  most  essential  users,  the  individuals  who  protect  our  persons  and 
property,  also  have  a  paramount  need  to  access  the  almost  mind-boggling  capabili-
ties  that  can  be  delivered  on  an  advanced  wireless  broadband  network.  We  must 
identify  an  approach  that  at  last  will  permit  public  safety  users  to  be  at  the  fore-
front of this Nation’s telecommunications revolution. 

On  April  27,  2006,  Cyren  Call  filed  a  comprehensive  proposal  with  the  FCC  in 
which it recommended the creation of a nationwide, wireless broadband network for 
public safety and commercial use employing an innovative public sector-private sec-
tor  partnership  and  funding  method.  In  my  opinion,  and  as  indicated  by  the  public 
safety  representatives  who  address  you  today,  this  shared  30  MHz  governmental/ 
commercial network at 700 MHz, described more fully below, is the only technically 
and financially viable solution for the following reasons: 

• First,  those  who  protect  our  lives  and  property  should  be  using  best-in-class, 
state-of-the-art  wireless  technology,  and  all  too  frequently  they  are  not.  Both 
spectrum and financial limitations act as barriers to that objective. 
• Second,  the  Nation’s  public  safety  mobile  capabilities  must  be  upgraded  as  the 
FCC has reported on several occasions over the past few years. The public safe-
ty  community’s  expanded  responsibilities  require  a  nationwide,  interoperable 
broadband  network  at  700  MHz.  Comments  filed  by  thousands  of  public  safety 
representatives in response to several recent FCC proceedings confirm that they 
embrace the idea of a 700 MHz broadband public safety network. 
• Third,  the  realities  of  local,  state  and  even  Federal  funding  constraints  make 
it clear that the public sector—on its own—cannot finance a broadband network 
with  the  necessary  geographic  coverage  and  technical  capabilities.  Indeed,  ear-
lier  this  week,  the  Administration  proposed  sharp  cuts  in  FY  2008  grants  for 
first  responders.  And  even  if  such  a  network  could  be  built  with  taxpayer  dol-
lars—a  daunting  assumption  that  requires  the  availability  of  tens  of  billions  of 
dollars  for  that  purpose  alone—the  ongoing  cost  of  operating,  maintaining  and 
continuously  upgrading  it  to  keep  pace  with  technological  improvements  vastly 
exceeds available public funding sources.

• Fourth,  more  than  twenty-five  years  of  commercial  wireless  deployment  has 
also made it clear that no business case has emerged to induce commercial car-
riers  to  build  out  their  networks  beyond  areas  of  relative  population  density, 
even  though  substantial  spectrum  has  been  made  available  for  that  purpose. 
Yet,  the  individuals  in  those  communities  still  require  police,  fire,  emergency 
medical and other vital governmental services. Moreover, they deserve access to 
the same wireless broadband technology that is transforming peoples’ lives and 
their ways of conducting business in more urban markets. 

The considerable time I have spent over the past years with police, fire, EMS and 
other emergency response providers, those serving rural, sparsely populated commu-
nities  as  well  as  those  in  major  urban  areas,  has  given  me  a  deep  appreciation  for 
their  truly  unique  communications  requirements.  Access  to  tomorrow’s  broadband 
devices  will  be  essential,  for  example,  to  enable  police  officers  to  have  real-time 
(streaming) video of a crime scene or major disaster as it unfolds. That type of situa-
tional  awareness  will  give  first  responders  a  quantum  leap  in  intelligence,  a  21st 
century equivalent to body armor. 

Just  as  important,  it  is  becoming  increasingly  clear  that  the  Nation  needs  a  se-
cure  wireless  broadband  network  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  critical  infrastructure 
community,  upon  which  our  economy  and  well-being  depend.  Their  access  to  a  se-
cure  broadband  network,  in  times  of  national  threat  or  emergency  will  be  a  vital 
enhancement to the Nation’s security. 

At Nextel I had hands-on experience building a commercial wireless network from 
the  ground  up,  while  also  converting  operations  from  analog  to  digital  technology. 
I  know  what  is  required  to  finance,  deploy,  operate,  maintain  and  upgrade  a  top- 
quality, large-scale wireless network. Even with that experience, I do not underesti-
mate the even greater challenge of building a nationwide broadband network to the 
more  demanding  public  safety  specifications  and  fully  appreciate  that  the  commit-
ment,  of  necessity,  is  long-term.  But  it  must  be  started  now  and  started  right.  If 
public safety is to enjoy the advanced capabilities it needs and deserves, its wireless 
devices  must  be  developed  in  conjunction  with  the  right  technology  platform,  not 
retrofitted to conform to a system built to less stringent commercial standards. 

It  is  the  combination  of  these  factors  that  led  to  the  creation  of  Cyren  Call  and 
its  work  with  the  public  safety  community  in  developing  the  concept  of  a  govern-
mental/commercial  shared  30  MHz  broadband  network  at  700  MHz,  the  license  for 
which  would  be  held  by  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  (PSBT).  The  PSBT 
would  consist  of  representatives  of  a  broad  variety  of  local,  state  and  Federal  Gov-
ernmental  entities  and  organizations.  Excess  capacity  on  the  30  MHz  would  be 
leased  to  commercial  carriers  for  entirely  commercial  service  in  exchange  for  build-
ing, maintaining, operating and upgrading the network in accordance with specifica-
tions  established  by  the  PSBT.  The  PSBT  proposal  contemplates  that  public  safety 
entities  would  pay  for  their  own  subscriber  equipment  and  for  system  access.  How-
ever,  they  would  avoid  the  infrastructure  costs  that  require  extraordinary  bond  or 
other  taxpayer  measures,  measures  that  take  years  to  effectuate  and,  at  best,  pro-
vide  individual  organizations  with  equipment  that  already  may  be  outdated  by  the 
time it is deployed, and which then cannot be upgraded for years or decades without 
additional taxpayer funding. Instead, the PSBT approach would mirror the commer-
cial approach to network upgrades; public safety technology would be refreshed rou-
tinely  in  accordance  with  the  demands  of  the  consumer  marketplace,  although  al-
ways consistent with the PSBT specifications as well. Public safety also would enjoy 
the  cost  economies  of  subscriber  devices  produced  in  volume  for  the  broader  con-
sumer  market,  economies  that  continue  to  drive  down  the  cost  of  cell  phones  and 
other wireless products. 

The result would be a nationwide broadband network available to serve both pub-
lic safety entities and the general public. It would not replace existing public safety 
voice  facilities,  but  would  provide  access  to  a  state-of-the-art  system  built  specifi-
cally to public safety standards. On a day-to-day basis, the great majority of capac-
ity  would  be  devoted  to  commercial  usage.  While  public  and  private  wireless  oper-
ations  traditionally  have  been  viewed  as  incompatible,  the  21st  century  network 
contemplated  in  the  PSBT  proposal  permits  rational  shared  use.  The  first  commer-
cial  subscribers  are  likely  to  be  a  combination  of  users  such  as  utilities  with  more 
demanding  public  safety-like  requirements  and  first  adopters  who  want  access  to 
the  most  advanced  technology  available.  However  during  emergencies,  whether  of 
a  local,  statewide,  regional  or  even  nationwide  scope,  increased  access  and  capacity 
would  automatically  be  dedicated  for  emergency  response  provider  purposes  on  a 
scaled  basis  as  dictated  by  the  event.  Of  course,  the  rules  of  the  road  with  respect 
to preemption would be established in advance by the PSBT so that those transmit-
ting  less  critical  communications  would  know  to  anticipate  some  disruption  during

those  events.  Those  with  vital  transmissions,  network  users  at  the  local,  state  and 
Federal levels, would have immediate, seamless interoperability. Public safety agen-
cies  operating  on  their  own  systems  in  other  bands  also  could  be  provided  with 
interoperability through IP-based gateway patches that would reside on the network 
and use its IP backbone resources. 

The  operation  of  this  network  would  represent  a  substantial  challenge  for  com-
mercial  wireless  veterans  and  will  require  careful  oversight  by  the  PSBT,  whose 
members  are  not  professional  network  operators.  The  legislation  therefore  permits, 
but  most  certainly  does  not  require,  the  PSBT  to  hire  personnel  or  enter  into  con-
tracts with parties that bring skills critical to the network’s success. Cyren Call be-
lieves it has the qualifications to take on important responsibilities vis-a`-vis the net-
work and has raised capital in anticipation of responding to any PSBT management 
services  request  for  proposal.  However,  I  will  state  here  for  the  record  what  I  have 
stated publicly and repeatedly since filing the proposal with the FCC in April 2006: 
Cyren  Call  is  not  asking  for  a  guarantee  of  any  ongoing  role  with  respect  to  the 
PSBT or this 700 MHz spectrum. All such decisions will remain firmly in the hands 
of  the  PSBT,  participation  in  which  will  be  limited  exclusively  to  public  safety/gov-
ernmental organizations. 

Representatives of the Nation’s police and fire officers have explained to the Com-
mittee  their  critical  need  for  broadband  capability  on  a  national  scale.  They  have 
described some of the functions that cannot be introduced on their current radio sys-
tems,  but  that  would  be  available  on  a  30  MHz  broadband  network.  Public  safety 
officers  are  hampered  today  by  not  having  access  to  features  such  as  streaming 
video, large file downloads (e.g., building diagrams and architectural plans), remote 
database  access  and  multi-media  messaging  capability.  And  these  are  the  capabili-
ties  that  we  already  know  are  needed.  The  history  of  telecommunications  teaches 
us  that  the  introduction  of  improved  technologies  spawns  applications  and 
functionalities even beyond those originally anticipated. Who could have anticipated 
in 1983 when the first analog cellular system was activated that subscribers in 2007 
would  be  using  their  ‘‘phones’’  to  take  pictures,  watch  television,  read  e-mails  and 
maintain  calendars?  It  is  not  possible  to  envision  today  all  of  the  uses  to  which 
emergency  response  providers  and  commercial  subscribers  will  put  this  broadband 
network  since  the  only  limits  will  be  those  of  entrepreneurial  ingenuity.  However, 
a  compelling  advantage  of  this  public/private  broadband  partnership  is  that  public 
safety  at  last  will  enjoy  the  ongoing  technical  developments  that  now  are  taken  for 
granted  by  subscribers  on  commercial  networks.  Competition  in  a  fully  competitive 
marketplace is a powerful engine for driving technological advances. 

Technical  improvements  on  this  order  require  an  appropriate  spectrum  platform. 
Yet critics of this governmental/commercial shared network claim that public safety 
does  not  need  additional  spectrum  on  which  to  deploy  a  broadband  network.  They 
argue  that  public  safety  could  meet  its  needs  by  using  its  existing  spectrum  more 
effectively. 

The  proponents  of  such  criticism  either  are  woefully  misinformed  or  are  willfully 
disingenuous  about  the  reality  of  public  safety  spectrum  allocations.  Most  public 
safety spectrum is allocated in individual 25 kHz or 12.5 kHz channels. These chan-
nels  are  but  a  fraction  of  the  spectrum  awarded  to  each  cellular  and  PCS  licensee 
and,  even  then,  are  not  contiguous  to  one  another.  Under  rules  and  procedures  es-
tablished by the FCC, they are interleaved with channels used by a variety of non- 
public  safety  entities  and  must  coexist  with  them.  Even  if  the  FCC  were  inclined 
to displace all existing public safety operations on this shared spectrum, those indi-
vidual  channels  could  not  be  cobbled  together  to  create  a  block  of  contiguous  spec-
trum  adequate  to  support  a  broadband  network.  Suggesting  otherwise  is  a  delib-
erate  attempt  to  mislead  Congress  and  this  Committee.  The  fact  that  this  fiction 
originated from CTIA, the organization representing the wireless carriers who have 
made no secret of their appetite for the spectrum in question, speaks volumes. 

The public safety community also has stated already that even the 12 MHz of con-
tiguous  public  safety  spectrum  at  700  MHz  proposed  by  the  FCC  for  a  nationwide 
broadband  network  is  entirely  inadequate  for  that  purpose.  They  have  determined 
that  it  would  not  provide  enough  capacity  to  accommodate  all  governmental 
broadband  usage,  much  less  provide  excess  capacity  that  would  attract  commercial 
partners. 

It is for precisely this reason that the public safety community has embraced the 
fundamental  premise  of  the  PSBT  legislation—a  shared  governmental/commercial 
30  MHz  broadband  network  is  the  only  economically  realistic  vehicle  for  delivering 
broadband  capabilities  to  local,  state  and  Federal  public  safety  users  as  well  as  to 
the  American  people  that  live  beyond  the  outposts  of  commercial  wireless  deploy-
ment.  If  there  is  a  better  answer,  one  that  addresses  all  of  the  technical  and  eco-
nomic factors that must be integrated to produce a workable solution, its proponents

should be here, before this Committee, so that their proposal could be tested for co-
hesiveness and validity. The needs of public safety are urgent and immediate. They 
should  not  be  deferred  in  the  hope  that  this  problem  will  resolve  itself  or  that  an 
easier  solution  will  emerge.  They  most  certainly  should  not  be  denied  because  of  a 
previously enacted Congressional auction schedule. 

Last  week’s  oversight  hearings  also  reaffirmed  that  this  Committee  and  the  FCC 
consider  ubiquitous  broadband  deployment  one  of  the  fundamental  challenges  for 
our  Nation’s  telecommunications  policies.  There  is  no  question  that  state-of-the-art 
broadband technology should be delivered to all of our citizens, not just those in the 
more  densely  populated  communities  that  support  purely  commercial  deployment. 
Indeed, several Senators questioned whether there should be incentives for more ex-
pansive  broadband  deployment  and  how  addressing  this  issue  might  impact  the 
Universal Service Fund. 

The  shared  governmental/commercial  network  proposed  in  the  PSBT  legislation 
represents  a  solution  that  requires  neither  governmental  incentives  nor  USF  mon-
eys.  Chief  McEwen  has  explained  the  financial  structure  of  the  PSBT  legislation. 
He  has  described  how  the  Federal  Treasury  will  be  compensated  for  the  30  MHz 
of spectrum that would be allocated to the PSBT rather than auctioned. 

The  success  of  this  approach  is  dependent  upon  two  factors.  First,  the  network 
must  be  conceived,  organized  and  operated  as  a  nationwide  system  with  operations 
in more commercially attractive markets such as Los Angeles and New York defray-
ing  the  cost  of  providing  service  in  areas  such  as  North  Dakota,  South  Dakota,  Ar-
kansas,  Mississippi,  and  West  Virginia.  The  network  must  operate  on  the  principle 
of coupling access to prime spectrum usage rights in commercially desirable markets 
with the obligation to build and operate, or contribute to the construction and oper-
ation  of,  the  network  in  more  sparsely  populated  and  underserved  markets.  If  not, 
it  will  be  bound  by  the  same  economic  barriers  that,  to  date,  have  defined  the  geo-
graphic coverage of commercial wireless systems. Indeed, one of the PSBT’s greatest 
challenges  will  be  balancing  public  safety  coverage  requirements  with  the  implac-
able economic realities of network costs. 

Second,  there  must  be  sufficient  capacity  to  support  governmental  usage  while 
still  attracting  commercial  interest.  The  former  dictates  that  the  network  be  built 
to hardened public safety specifications, substantially beyond the requirements of a 
typical  commercial  system,  and  that  it  have  truly  nationwide  coverage  through  a 
combination of terrestrial and satellite service. The cost of deploying such a network 
is  substantial.  The  commercial  operators  who  will  be  building,  maintaining,  oper-
ating  and  improving  it  pursuant  to  their  lease  arrangements  with  the  PSBT  must 
be  confident  that  there  will  be  sufficient  commercial  capacity  to  support  significant 
usage by a commercial customer base large enough to justify their investments. 

Let  me  share  with  you  a  summary  of  the  analysis  that  suggests  30  MHz  is  the 

minimum needed to support a viable network of this scope. 

• Terrestrial  Coverage  Cost:  Public  safety  must  provide  services  wherever  there 
is public to serve. A nationwide public safety broadband network is assumed to 
require  a  terrestrial  build  to  99.3  percent  population  coverage.  The  favorable 
propagation  characteristics  at  700  MHz  help  reduce  costs  of  network  construc-
tion,  operation  and  maintenance  vis-a`-vis  building  out  in  a  higher  band,  but 
even  with  the  700  MHz  coverage  advantages,  it  still  is  estimated  that  approxi-
mately 37,000 cell sites will be needed. 
• Satellite Coverage Cost: Although the terrestrial build-out would cover 99.3 per-
cent  of  the  population,  35  percent  of  the  Nation’s  land  mass  would  not  receive 
service  from  terrestrial  sites.  To  ensure  that  public  safety  providers  and  the 
general public scattered throughout these sparsely populated areas nonetheless 
would  have  coverage,  coverage  that  is  not  always  available  even  today,  and  to 
guarantee a level of nationwide redundancy in the event of a catastrophe along 
the  lines  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  satellite  coverage  will  be  an  essential  part  of 
the  network.  Both  terrestrial  and  satellite  capabilities  would  be  built  into 
handsets  so  that  emergency  response  providers  will  develop  a  full  familiarity 
with both as part of their day-to-day radio operations. 
• Hardened  Network  Cost:  The  occasional  dropped  call  or  network  outage  is  an 
inconvenience, not a catastrophe, for a commercial subscriber. When a police or 
fire  officer  or  an  EMT  loses  communications,  a  life  may  be  lost.  Because  of  the 
responsibilities  their  personnel  shoulder,  public  safety  agencies  require  their 
communications  systems  to  be  built  to  significantly  higher  standards  of  reli-
ability  and  redundancy  than  are  the  norm  in  commercial  networks.  Each  of 
these elements adds cost to the network. 
• Operational/Maintenance/Upgrade  Cost:  Economic  analyses  often  focus  on  the 
cost of initial network deployment and fail to calculate the very substantial on-

going  expenses  associated  with  operating,  maintaining  and  upgrading  wireless 
systems.  In  fact,  those  costs  can  dwarf  build-out  expenses  even  when  the  up- 
front  investment  is  significant.  A  37,000  plus  site  network  providing  advanced 
capabilities  to  millions  of  public  safety  and  commercial  subscribers  will  have 
very  significant  operational  and  maintenance  costs.  Refreshing  the  network 
with  technology  upgrades  as  dictated  by  the  marketplace  and  consistent  with 
PSBT  specifications  will  require  additional  financial  commitments  on  the  part 
of the commercial operators. 
• Estimated  Usage:  The  history  of  wireless  communications  is  that  subscriber 
usage  invariably  exceeds  estimates.  The  spectrum  efficiencies  gained  when  im-
proved  technologies  are  introduced  permit  new  applications  that  themselves 
prompt additional system utilization. The impact on network usage when public 
safety leapfrogs from voice-centric communications to streaming video and other 
spectrum-consuming  applications  will  be  extraordinary.  And  the  data  applica-
tions  that  drive  broadband  usage  will  only  expand  once  this  next-generation 
network is deployed. The viability of the network will depend, among other fac-
tors, on ensuring that it has sufficient capacity to support these more capacity- 
consuming  applications  while  maintaining  a  public  safety  grade  blocking  rate. 
• Required  Rate  of  Return:  Commercial  operators  have  a  financial  obligation  to 
their investors and/or shareholders. The potential rate of return associated with 
the shared governmental/commercial network described herein must justify the 
investment required to fund the elements identified above. This requires capac-
ity that is adequate to accommodate local, state and Federal Government usage 
with  enough  excess  capacity  to  support  an  economically  remunerative  commer-
cial  subscriber  base  as  well.  There  is  no  viable  business  case  for  a  shared  12 
MHz  nationwide  broadband  network.  30  MHz  is  the  minimum  allocation  that 
will satisfy this purpose. 

By scheduling this hearing, this Committee already has demonstrated its serious-
ness  of  purpose  with  respect  to  public  safety  communications  requirements.  It  has 
been apparent for some time that the traditional response to a worsening situation, 
piecemeal financing of individual, incompatible systems serving individual needs, is 
prohibitively  costly  to  taxpayers  and  does  not  address  what  clearly  is  a  systemic 
problem. 

The  solution  endorsed  by  the  public  safety  community,  creation  of  the  PSBT  and 
the  assignment  to  it  of  a  30  MHz  authorization  designated  specifically  for  deploy-
ment  of  a  nationwide,  advanced  technology,  interoperable,  and  secure  wireless 
broadband  network  shared  by  governmental  and  commercial  users,  represents  a 
unique  opportunity  to  address  both  public  safety  and  rural  broadband  needs.  But 
time is not on the side of those who support this initiative. Its opponents recognize 
that  actions  taken  by  prior  Congresses  mean  that  the  clock  continues  to  tick  down 
toward  the  auction  deadline  for  this  700  MHz  spectrum.  A  failure  to  act  promptly 
will eliminate this solution by default and stalemate, and rob Congress of the oppor-
tunity to engage in reasoned decisionmaking on this vital national issue. 

I urge Congress to embrace the comprehensive approach set out in the PSBT leg-
islation  and  endorse  a  public/private  partnership  that  will  deliver  wireless 
broadband  service  to  all  of  the  American  public  and  provide  public  safety  with  the 
telecommunications capabilities needed to protect the safety of our citizenry. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
And  may  I  now  call  upon  President  and  CEO  of  CTIA,  Steve 

Largent? 
STATEMENT OF HON. STEVE LARGENT, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 

CTIA—THE WIRELESS ASSOCIATION  

Mr.  LARGENT.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Inouye  and  Co-Chairman 
Stevens  and  members  of  the  Committee.  Thank  you  for  the  oppor-
tunity to testify today. 

I  support  the  idea  of  an  interoperable  wireless  broadband  public 
safety network. One only has to look at the efforts between the in-
dustry  and  public  safety  on  E–911,  wireless  priority  service,  wire-
less  AMBER  alerts,  and,  most  recently,  the  WARN  Act  and  emer-
gency  alerts,  to  know  that  this  industry  is  serious  about  public 
safety. We will do our part in this instance, too.

I  have  several  points  to  make  to  you  today.  First,  Congress  got 
it right a year ago, when it passed the DTV Act, setting a firm date 
for  the  full  conversion  to  digital  television  and  giving  public  safety 
agencies  access  to  an  additional  24  megahertz  of  spectrum  in  the 
700-megahertz  band.  This  will  double  public  safety’s  spectrum  in-
ventory  from  pre-September  11th  levels.  Additionally,  this  com-
mittee  was  instrumental  in  providing  a  billion  dollars  in  funding 
for  interoperable  communications  to  be  drawn  from  commercial 
spectrum  auction  proceeds.  The  DTV  Act  promises  an  expedient 
transition  to  digital  television,  advanced  wireless  broadband  serv-
ices, and enhanced interoperability for our first responders. Now is 
not the time for change. 

Second,  interoperability  challenges  faced  by  first  responders  are 
not based on a lack of spectrum. Upon completion of the DTV tran-
sition, public safety will have 49.7 megahertz of spectrum to use for 
state-of-the-art  voice  and  data  services  to  serve  approximately  3 
million  first  responders.  Cyren  Call  would  have  you  believe  that 
public safety networks will use that spectrum only to provide voice 
service  and  that  more  spectrum  is  needed  for  data.  CTIA’s  largest 
carriers use, on average, the same amount of spectrum, yet provide 
both  voice  and  broadband  data  services  to  more  than  50  million 
customers each. This debate should not be about spectrum. 

If  the  problem  facing  public  safety  is  not  spectrum,  what  is  the 
problem? I offer that it is, as was said earlier, limited funding and 
divided  turf.  I  don’t  dispute  the  need  to  improve  interoperability 
and  the  broadband  capabilities  of  our  Nation’s  public  safety  com-
munications  system.  If  the  Committee  is  looking  for  a  model  solu-
tion for how to deal with these challenges, I suggest you look to the 
effort of New York City. Under the leadership of Mayor Bloomberg, 
it has made great strides toward solving interoperability challenges 
that cost them so dearly on September 11th. Last September, New 
York City announced it had awarded a contract for a public safety 
broadband wireless network that will utilize 10 megahertz of spec-
trum  in  the  2.5  gigahertz  band  to  provide  enhanced,  interoperable 
broadband services. Solutions addressing the needs of public safety 
are available today. 

Third,  Cyren  Call’s  plan  should  be  rejected.  It’s  untimely,  un-
wise,  and  unnecessary  less  than  10  months  before  the  auction  is 
expected  to  occur.  The  Cyren  Call  plan  could  have  been  debated 
during the period in which the DTV bill was crafted, but it was not. 
That was a 10-year period of time. The proposal is a giveaway that 
shortchanges  the  U.S.  Treasury,  potentially  by  billions  of  dollars. 
Additionally,  the  financing  scheme  set  forth  in  Cyren  Call’s  pro-
posal effectively requires taxpayers to subsidize Mr. O’Brien’s entry 
into  the  commercial  space.  Today,  wireless  industry  is  highly  com-
petitive,  and  there’s  no  compelling  reason  to  subsidize  additional 
entry. 

Fourth, if Cyren Call’s proposal is not the solution, what is? The 
wireless industry accepts that it has a responsibility to provide ex-
pertise  in  what  works  and  what  doesn’t  work  to  solve  public  safe-
ty’s  interoperability  needs.  Accordingly,  I  am  pleased  to  announce 
that  the  Silicon  Flatiron’s  program  at  the  University  of  Colorado, 
through  a  grant  provided  by  CTIA,  will  host  a  2-day  joint  experts 
meeting here in Washington, D.C., the week of April 9th. Dale Hat-

field,  the  respected  former  head  of  the  Office  of  Engineering  and 
Technology at the FCC, has indicated a willingness to lead this ef-
fort. Leaders from the public safety world will be invited to join ex-
perts  from  the  commercial  sector  to  discuss  the  best  solutions  for 
public  safety.  They  will  address  broadband  and  interoperability, 
and  specifically  investigate  use  of  CMRS  technologies,  unlicensed 
WiMAX, and Muni WiFi applications, solutions from New York and 
the  Washington  National  Capital  Region,  reliance  on  a  national 
systems  integrator,  as  well  as  issues  involving  spectrum  needs, 
costs, time to market, and complexity. I’ve spoken to several of our 
largest  carrier  manufacturer  CEOs,  and  they  have  committed  to 
have  their  leading  subject-matter  experts  at  the  meeting.  The  goal 
is  not  another  discussion,  but  real  work  toward  the  best  solutions. 
Putting the best minds together can get us there. 

What is needed from Congress is a continued commitment to the 
DTV  transition  and  the  interoperability  grant  programs.  You  can 
use your influence to help solve the leadership and turf battles that 
too often slow progress towards interoperability, and you can reject 
the  false  choice  that  one  must  be  for  Mr.  O’Brien’s  plan  to  be  for 
public safety, as that is not the case. 

Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. STEVE LARGENT, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 

CTIA—THE WIRELESS ASSOCIATION  

Chairman Inouye, Vice Chairman Stevens and members of the Committee, thank 
you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  this  morning  on  an  issue  that  is  of  great  signifi-
cance  to  the  wireless  industry,  but  more  importantly,  critical  to  the  security  and 
safety of this country—the present and future of public safety communications. 

As  someone  who  was  a  Member  of  Congress  on  September  11th,  2001  and  now 
as  President  of  CTIA,  I  am  keenly  aware  of  the  need  for  a  national,  interoperable 
wireless  broadband  public  safety  network.  I  am  proud  to  say  that  the  wireless  in-
dustry  has  a  long  and  proven  track  record  of  working  with  public  safety  agencies 
throughout  the  country  to  develop  public  safety  and  interoperability  solutions.  One 
only has to look at the collaborative efforts between the wireless industry and public 
safety  on  E–911,  Wireless  Priority  Service,  Wireless  AMBER  Alerts  and,  most  re-
cently, the WARN Act and emergency alerts to know that this industry is committed 
to  developing  a  world  class  21st  century  communications  network.  It  is  imperative 
that  our  Nation’s  first  responders  have  access  to  the  latest  technology,  such  as 
broadband  data  and  video  capabilities  that  are  now  currently  available  in  wireless 
handsets used by American consumers. 

This  Committee  and  Congress  got  it  right  a  year  ago  when  it  passed  The  Digital 
Television  Transition  and  Public  Safety  Act  (DTV  Act)  setting  a  firm  date  for  the 
full  conversion  from  analog  to  digital  television.  The  DTV  Act  represents  years  of 
careful  consideration  on  the  part  of  Congress,  the  FCC,  NTIA,  public  safety,  tele-
vision  broadcasters,  and  the  wireless  and  technology  industries.  As  a  result  of  this 
landmark  legislation,  public  safety  agencies  will  have  access  to  an  additional  24 
MHz of spectrum in the prime 700 MHz band doubling public safety’s spectrum in-
ventory  as  compared  to  pre-9/11  levels.  Additionally,  this  Committee  was  instru-
mental in providing $1 billion in funding for interoperable communications from the 
auction proceeds of commercial spectrum. 

As Chairman Martin and Commissioner Adelstein said last week before the Com-
mittee,  the  reallocation  of  the  700  MHz  band  is  one  of  the  most  important  under-
takings before the Commission. I commend the FCC on taking the next crucial step 
with  its  notice  of  proposed  rulemaking  which  solicits  input  from  the  best  and  the 
brightest  as  to  how  best  to  deploy  an  interoperable  network  utilizing  the  24  MHz 
of prime spectrum. 

Congress  has  made  prudent  decisions  by  setting  a  hard  date  for  the  DTV  transi-
tion and by making funding available to public safety for interoperability grants. It 
is  therefore  crucial  that  the  auction  for  this  spectrum  occur  expeditiously.  A  timely 
auction  will  raise  much  needed  funds  for  interoperability  and  make  the  promise  of

wireless broadband a reality for the U.S. economy, consumers, and importantly, the 
millions  of  non-first  responder  government  officials  who  rely  on  commercial  net-
works to keep their cell phones and PDAs functioning during a crisis. 

There  is  no  dispute  regarding  the  need  to  improve  interoperability  and  the 
broadband  capabilities  of  our  Nation’s  public  safety  communications  system;  how-
ever,  the  Cyren  Call  plan  or  other  proposals  that  stray  from  the  path  set  by  the 
DTV Act only serve to hinder and delay the transition. 

It  is  the  firm  belief  of  CTIA  and  the  wireless  industry  that  now  is  not  the  time 
to  alter  the  procedures  set  in  place  by  the  DTV  Act.  Congress  and  the  FCC  must 
remain  committed  to  the  current  course,  which  promises  an  expedient  transition  to 
digital  television,  advanced  wireless  broadband  services,  and  most  importantly,  en-
hanced interoperability for our first responders. 

I  would  like  to  emphasize  that  the  current  interoperability  challenges  faced  by 
first  responders  is  not  based  on  a  lack  of  spectrum.  Upon  completion  of  the  DTV 
transition as currently configured, public safety will have 49.7 MHz of spectrum (not 
including  the  50  MHz  that  they  have  been  allocated  in  the  4.9  GHz  band)  to  use 
for voice and data services to serve approximately 3 million first responders. Cyren 
Call  would  have  you  believe  that  public  safety  networks  will  use  that  49.7  MHz  to 
provide only voice service to the 3 million first responders, and that more spectrum 
is needed for data. In comparison, three of our largest carriers use, on average, the 
same  amount  of  spectrum,  yet  provide  both  voice  AND  broadband  data  services  to 
over 50 million customers each, with two of them serving over 60 million. Commer-
cial operators, using the same 50 MHz of spectrum, can provide voice and data serv-
ice  to  60  million  Americans.  The  commercial  wireless  industry  provides  interoper-
able voice and data services to twenty times the number of customers as are served 
by public safety. This is not about spectrum. 

Professor  Jon  Peha  of  Carnegie  Mellon  has  studied  the  current  fragmented  ap-
proach  to  public  safety  communications,  and  has  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the 
current  approach  consumes  more  spectrum  than  it  should.  To  date,  the  United 
States has assigned approximately 200 MHz of spectrum to the commercial wireless 
industry,  and  there  currently  are  over  230  million  subscribers.  National  wireless 
carriers  in  the  U.S.,  on  average,  use  1  MHz  of  spectrum  to  provide  service  to  one 
million  customers.  After  the  700  MHz  auction,  public  safety  will  have  almost  50 
MHz  of  spectrum  to  serve  3  million  first  responder  subscribers.  Public  safety  will 
have  16  times  more  spectrum,  per  user,  than  the  average  nationwide  carrier  does 
now,  and  again,  this  figure  does  not  include  the  50  MHz  of  spectrum  that  public 
safety has been allocated in the 4.9 GHz band. Even before the DTV transition, pub-
lic safety currently has 8 MHz per million users. If spectrum is not the problem in-
hibiting  a  coordinated  and  cohesive  interoperable  public  safety  network,  then  what 
is the problem? 

If  the  Committee  is  looking  for  an  answer  to  this  question,  I  would  suggest  the 

Committee should examine effort of New York City. 

Last September, New York City announced it had awarded a five-year, $500 mil-
lion  dollar  contract  to  Northrup  Grumman  to  develop  a  public  safety  broadband 
wireless network. The proposed network will utilize 10 MHz of spectrum in the 2.5 
GHz  band,  and  is  designed  to  enhance  public  safety  by  facilitating  communication 
between  first  responders.  The  network  will  utilize  Universal  Mobile  Telecommuni-
cations System (UMTS) technology from IP Wireless because of its inherent spectral 
efficiency, which reduces the network’s need for spectrum while providing New York 
with  a  technology  sufficient  for  its  public  safety  wireless  broadband  requirements. 
According  to  IP  Wireless,  the  system  can  deliver  download  data  rates  of  8  to  10 
megabits  with  future  versions  capable  of  30  megabits  of  download  speed.  These 
speeds can easily accommodate applications that first responders require. 

Examples  such  as  this  illustrate  that  through  the  use  of  modern  wireless  tech-
nologies, the 24 MHz of 700 MHz spectrum that already is allocated to public safety 
is  more  than  sufficient  to  meet  the  data  rates  and  bandwidth  requirements  for  an 
interoperable broadband service.

As I mentioned earlier, the DTV Act represents 10 years of painstaking delibera-
tion  on  the  part  of  policymakers  and  stakeholders.  Mr.  O’Brien  had  ample  oppor-
tunity during those 10 years to put forth his Cyren Call proposal and have its mer-
its  debated  before  the  DTV  legislation  was  enacted.  Instead,  Cyren  Call  offered  its 
proposed  alternative  approach  in  April  2006—two  months  after  the  legislation  was 
signed into law. 

In April of last year, Cyren Call filed a petition with the FCC requesting that an 
additional  30  MHz  of  commercial  spectrum  in  the  700  MHz  band  be  reallocated  to 
construct a nationwide broadband emergency communications system to be used by

first  responders.  Cyren  Call’s  business  plan,  and  to  be  clear,  Cyren  Call  is  a  for- 
profit  business  venture,  proposes  that  the  spectrum  be  deeded  to  a  ‘‘Public  Safety 
Broadband  Trust’’  which  would  in  turn  lease  the  spectrum  to  commercial  operators 
in exchange for their commitment to construct a national broadband network. 

On  November  3,  2006,  the  FCC  dismissed  Cyren  Call’s  petition,  noting  that  the 
venture is inconsistent with the DTV Act. Unwilling to take ‘‘no’’ for an answer, Mr. 
O’Brien  and  his  team  of  lobbyists  have  begun  seeking  legislation  based  on  the  pro-
posal the FCC rejected. 

The  Cyren  Call  proposal  shortchanges  the  U.S.  Treasury,  and  thus  the  tax-
payers—potentially by billions of dollars. Under the terms of Cyren Call’s proposal, 
the  corporation  is  entitled  to  purchase  a  chunk  of  the  valuable  700  MHz  band  on 
a  no-bid,  non-compete  basis,  for  an  amount  ‘‘not  to  exceed’’  $5  billion.  Many  recent 
estimates suggest this is likely to be far less than the spectrum would fetch at auc-
tion.  Additionally,  the  bill  requires  taxpayers  to  subsidize  the  corporation’s  below- 
market  purchase  of  the  spectrum  by  guaranteeing  up  to  $10  billion  of  loans  to  the 
corporation,  half  of  which  can  be  used  by  the  corporation  to  buy  the  public  safety 
broadband  license.  The  rest  could  be  paid  to  the  private  sector  entities  selected  by 
the  corporation  to  lease  the  spectrum,  in  essence  requiring  the  taxpayers  to  sub-
sidize those entities as well. Despite a decidedly mixed track record in administering 
complex indebtedness issues in the NextWave case, the FCC would provide the loan 
guarantees. 

Another  concern  the  Committee  should  examine  is  the  rural  component,  or  lack 
thereof, associated with the Cyren Call proposal. This plan offers little for those who 
live  in  the  more  sparsely  populated  areas  of  our  country.  Since  coming  on  board  at 
CTIA 3 years ago, one of the issues about which I hear most frequently from Mem-
bers  of  Congress  is  the  need  for  more  wireless  services  in  rural  America.  The  DTV 
Act, as enacted, promises to remedy this problem by enabling CTIA member compa-
nies to bring wireless broadband service in America’s rural communities more quick-
ly.

This  Committee  and  Congress  should  be  justifiably  proud  its  accomplishment  of 
in enacting the DTV Act, which allocates 24 MHz of spectrum for public safety; pro-
vides an estimated $7 billion for deficit reduction; and sets aside $1 billion for inter-
operability grants. The quicker these grants are dispersed, the quicker public safety 
can  address  their  interoperability  needs.  Unfortunately,  Cyren  Call’s  proposal  puts 
all the aforementioned at risk. 

Now, just 12 months before the DTV conversion is to be completed, is not the time 
for  Congress  to  be  changing  the  rules  of  the  game,  particularly  since  Mr.  O’Brien 
had  ample  opportunity  before  the  DTV  bill  was  enacted  to  come  forward  with  his 
proposal. 

What  is  needed  by  this  Committee  and  Congress  is  a  continued  commitment  to 
see  this  through.  Mr.  O’Brien  offers  you  the  false  choice  that  one  must  be  for  his 
plan to be for public safety. I am here to tell you that is not the case, and to pledge 
that the wireless industry stands ready to work with public safety to construct effi-
cient, interoperable networks for the health and welfare of our citizens. 

Thank you and I look forward to your questions. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Mr. Largent. 
May I now call on Chairman Billstrom? 
STATEMENT OF DAVID BILLSTROM, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, 

NATIONAL INTEROP, INC. 

Mr. BILLSTROM. Chairman Inouye, Vice Chairman Stevens, mem-
bers of the Committee, I’m deeply honored to be here today speak-
ing on interoperable communications from the front lines. 

My  name  is  David  Billstrom.  I  am  a  public  safety  communica-
tions  executive  with  a  25-year  history  in  the  computer  industry, 
radio  communications,  and  venture  capital,  but  I’m  also  a  first  re-
sponder.  I’ve  been  a  first  responder  for  over  25  years,  first  as  an 
EMT,  then  in  sheriff  search  and  rescue,  and  now  as  one  of  the 
27,000  volunteer  firefighters  in  the  Pacific  Northwest.  So,  I’m  in 
the  unusual  position  of  being  part  of  the  interoperability  problem 
and, I hope, part of the solution.

I’m  going  to  try  to  talk  about  three  things  today:  why  interoper-
ability  is  so  expensive,  what’s  wrong  with  the  plans  underway  in 
almost  every  State,  and  why  Google  provides  the  key  to  effective 
public safety communications. 

First, why is it expensive? If we continue on the current path to 
interoperability  solutions,  I  can  guarantee  that  in  5  years,  if  you 
invite me back, we’ll be back talking about this problem. The polit-
ical, policy, and media coverage of interoperability is dominated by 
the  equipment  issue.  And  as  anyone  who  knows  me  can  tell  you, 
I love equipment. But as a volunteer firefighter, I have a responsi-
bility  to  tell  you  that  it’s  not  about  the  equipment.  The  secret  is 
that  standard  operating  procedures,  training,  and  other  people 
issues  are  just  as  important.  The  FCC  report  on  Katrina  came  to 
the same conclusion. 

But  the  emphasis  on  equipment  is  understandable.  It’s  tangible. 
You  can  touch  it.  It’s  concrete.  And,  in  fact,  we’ve  asked  our  radio 
equipment  vendors  to—for  their  help  solving  our  problem,  and 
those  radio  vendors  have  done  their  best  to  give  us  a  good  an-
swer—in their own understandable business interests. 

In  the  last  several  years,  at  the  direction  of  Congress,  many 
States have reviewed their needs. They’ve generally proposed com-
pletely  new  statewide  systems.  Those  systems  will  be  state-of-the- 
art,  best-of-breed,  and  very  effective.  They’ll  also  be  the  most  ex-
pensive  radio  systems  ever  devised.  In  one  State,  the  construction 
costs  worked  out  to  $65,000  per  user,  and  then  the  cost  of  the  ra-
dios,  $3,500.  Why  does  it  matter  to  the  Committee?  With  every 
State  I’ve  met  with,  they  plan  to  ask  Congress  to  pay  for  most,  if 
not  all,  of  these  statewide  systems.  How  much  are  we  talking 
about? In Washington State, $600 million; Oregon, $561 million for 
phase  1;  Florida’s  system  was  $900  million;  and  New  York  started 
construction  on  a  $2  billion  system.  A  good  working  number  for  a 
statewide  interoperability  system,  as  designed,  is  $1  billion  each. 
This  is  a  $50–$100  billion  problem.  And  here’s  the  kicker,  that 
price  does  not  include  radios  for  the  local  public  safety  agencies. 
It’s  for  the  State,  for  the  dispatch  centers,  for  the  towers,  and  for 
radios for the State public safety agencies, not the locals. 

This  committee  already  knows  that  72  percent  of  all  firefighters 
are volunteers, 79 percent of all police officers work for local police 
departments,  and  virtually  all  EMTs  are  local.  Eighty  percent  of 
our first responders work for local agencies. It goes without saying, 
they can’t all afford to buy new radios. 

The  approach  is  upside  down.  We  should  be  building  radio  sys-
tems  first  to  accommodate  the  nearly  2  million  local  first  respond-
ers,  then  the  State  and  Federal  responders,  not  the  other  way 
around. 

But  I  have  good  news.  First,  imagine  if  your  cell  phone  only 
worked  when  you  called  other  people  using  the  same  kind  of  cell 
phone  on  the  same  network.  So,  a  Verizon  customer  couldn’t  talk 
to  a  Sprint.  Imagine  if  you  couldn’t  access  Google  through  Dell 
computers,  only  HP.  It  would  be  ridiculous  in  a  commercial  world, 
but that’s exactly what we deal with in the public safety world. For 
example,  that  $3,500  police  radio  in  Seattle,  Washington;  if  you 
take it to Portland, Oregon, it won’t work.

Wireless carriers and Internet providers have already solved this 
fundamental  problem  of  interoperability,  because  they  had  to.  The 
same  core  idea  of  the  Internet  backbone  and  the  desire  to  commu-
nicate—indeed, the same technology—is going to solve our problem. 
The  U.S.  military  is  already  using  a  technology  called  IP  Radio  to 
connect  together  very  different  radios  all  over  the  world  for  over  4 
years.  Philosophically,  they  have  solved  our  problem.  And,  like 
Google and Yahoo!, the technology is absolutely independent of the 
hardware. There are several companies offering IP Radio. The mar-
ket’s  led  by  two  companies:  a  small  company,  Twisted  Pair  Solu-
tions, and a slightly larger company, Cisco. 

And it’s not just the U.S. military leading the way. A pilot project 
of  IP  Radio  known  as  OPSCAN,  in  Washington  State,  is  a  DHS- 
funded public safety system. It uses an IP Radio technology to con-
nect  together  41  different  local,  State,  and  Federal  agencies,  three 
Indian  tribes,  and  first  responders  from  Canada.  The  scope  of  this 
system is comparable to a small State, but at a fraction of the cost. 
IP isn’t magic, and it can’t do everything, but it will win the mar-
ketplace  of  ideas,  because  it’s  open,  standards-based,  and  afford-
able. It’s not closed, proprietary, or massively expensive. 

We also have an opportunity. In Washington State, we will soon 
face the daunting task of being prepared for the 2010 Olympics just 
over  the  Pacific  Northwest  border  with  Canada.  Senator  Cantwell 
has been on the front lines of helping us be prepared for this event, 
and  everyone,  from  the  Washington  State  Patrol  to  my  own  fire 
chief in San Juan County, is grateful. 

We  need  to  be  prepared,  and  we  need  interoperability.  First  re-
sponders in the region will be ready to roll for emergencies, except 
that  their  radios  do  not  work  with  the  new  radios  already  being 
carried by the Federal responders. And if a typical radio system is 
built, they won’t be able to use that either. 

Respectfully,  I’d  like  to  offer  three  suggestions  for  the  Com-

mittee. 

First,  mandate  the  use  of  IP  Radio  technology  when  funding 
interoperable communications such as the $1 billion. We must sup-
port  the  hard  work  of  the  States,  but  we  can’t  ask  every  first  re-
sponder  in  the  country  to  buy  a  new  radio.  Let’s  build  statewide 
systems that accommodate their existing radios. 

Second,  when  funding  the  expansion  of  a  radio  system,  require 
those systems to accommodate IP Radio technology. You’ll soon dis-
cover  two  or  three  proprietary  vendors  won’t  like  that  very  much, 
but 2 million first responders will. 

Third, consider taking advantage of the opportunity presented by 
the  2010  Olympics  and  build  an  IP  Radio  system  that  serves  the 
needs of the local first responders first, instead of last. 

I  also  want  to  applaud  Chairman  Martin,  of  the  FCC,  for  his 
comments  last  week  to  this  committee  in  which  he  called  for,  as  I 
have  here,  IP  Radio  technology  as  an  immediate  interoperability 
solution.  He  stated  that  if  funds  were  available  now,  the  entire 
country could be covered within 4 years. And I agree. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID BILLSTROM, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, 

NATIONAL INTEROP, INC. 

Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Vice  Chairman,  and  members  of  the  Committee.  Thank  you 

very much for the opportunity to speak today. 

My name is David Billstrom, and I am a public safety communications consultant 
with a long background in radio communications, the computer industry and in ven-
ture  capital.  I’ve  also  been  a  first  responder  for  over  25  years.  First  as  an  EMT, 
then  sheriff’s  search  and  rescue  for  many  years,  and  one  of  27,000  volunteer  fire-
fighters in the Pacific Northwest. 

I want to give you just a few high-level observations on public safety communica-
tions—from  my  somewhat  unusual  position  of  being  both  part  of  the  problem,  and 
I hope, part of the solution. 

I’m  going  to  talk  about  three  things:  why  interoperability  is  expensive,  what’s 
wrong  with  the  plans  underway  in  almost  every  state  in  this  country,  and  why 
Google provides the key to effective public safety communications. 
Why Is Interoperability Expensive? 

If  we  continue  on  the  current  path  to  interoperability  solutions,  I  can  guarantee 
you  that  5  years  from  today,  if  you  invite  me  back,  we  will  still  be  talking  about 
the problems with interoperability. 

That  is  because  both  historically  and  currently,  questions  of  interoperability  as-
sume  that  we  have  an  equipment  problem  that  calls  for  completely  new  radio  sys-
tems  and  new  radios.  I  believe  this  is  because  we’re  relying  upon  the  same  equip-
ment suppliers that we have used for years. 

And  these  equipment  suppliers  have  a  vested  interest  in  ‘‘solving  the  problem’’ 

with more radio equipment. 

The  focus  on  new  equipment  is  understandable.  Equipment  is  tangible,  it’s  con-
crete,  you  can  touch  it.  And  of  course  we  always  need  better  equipment,  and  more 
of it. 

But  an  equipment-centric  approach  is  very,  very  expensive.  Which  means  it  will 

take years. 
Statewide Interoperability Systems 

tive. 

The  good  news  is  that  in  the  last  several  years,  hard-working  committees  called 
‘‘SIECs’’,  or  State  Interoperability  Executive  Committees—in  more  than  half  of  all 
the states have analyzed the needs of public safety and proposed new statewide sys-
tems that provide interoperability. 

These new statewide systems will be state-of-the-art, best-of-breed, and very effec-

The problem is, they are also the most expensive radio systems ever devised when 

calculated on a per-user basis. 

In  one  state,  the  cost  was  approximately  $65,000  per  radio  user  to  build  the  pro-
prietary system. Additionally, it will cost more every year to operate it. With 14,000 
users in this system, it is quite lucrative for equipment suppliers. 

Why  does  this  matter  to  this  Committee?  Because  most  of  the  states  I  have  met 
with  plan  to  ask  you,  the  Federal  Government,  to  pay  for  most  if  not  all  of  their 
new system. 

How much are we talking about? 
In  Washington  State,  we  have  an  initial  estimate  of  $600  million.  Our  Governor 
in  Oregon  has  just  proposed  $561  million  for  the  first  phase  of  the  system  there, 
which is likely to run past $1 billion when complete. 

Florida already has a $900 million system and New York has started on their $2 

billion system. 

The  math  is  fairly  easy—if  we  continue  in  this  direction  there  is  a  $50  to  $100 

billion funding requirement for interoperability for state agencies. 

But the news gets worse. 
The  problem  is,  these  statewide  systems  are  designed  for,  and  provided  to,  state 

agencies—not local public safety agencies. 

And,  as  you  may  know,  72  percent  of  the  one  million-plus  firefighters  in  the 
United  States  are  volunteers.  About  79  percent  of  all  800,000  law  enforcement  offi-
cers in the Nation work for local police departments. Nearly all EMTs are with local 
agencies.  In  fact,  only  20  percent  of  the  Nation’s  first  responders  work  for  state  or 
Federal agencies. All of the others are with local agencies. 

And  in  general,  local  public  safety  agencies  do  not  have  the  funds  for  new  radios 
compatible  with  these  new  statewide  proprietary  systems.  I  know  my  fire  depart-
ment does not. 

So  what  we  have  are  new  statewide  radio  systems  that  most  of  our  firefighters, 

EMTs, and police officers will not be able to afford to use.

The approach is upside down. We should be building public safety communication 
systems  that  first  accommodate  the  1.8  million  local  first  responders,  and  then  the 
200,000 state and Federal first responders, rather than the other way around. 
Open and Closed Systems 

You  may  be  wondering  how  we  can  accomplish  this.  This  is  where  Google  comes 

It is a simple issue—open versus closed systems. Imagine if you could only access 
Google  if  you  were  on  a  Dell  laptop,  because  IBM  laptops  didn’t  work  with  Google. 
That  might  sound  absurd,  but  that’s  exactly  the  current  state  of  first  responders 
in the Pacific Northwest—a police radio from Seattle, Washington does not work on 
the Portland, Oregon system—that is the world that proprietary systems create. 

The more proprietary—the less interoperable. 
Google  and  Yahoo!  and  all  Internet  businesses  thrive  because  the  services  they 

provide run on every type of computer made, world-wide. 

The  same  idea—indeed,  the  same  technology—is  going  to  solve  the  problem  of 

public safety communications. 

addressed this very same issue. 

I can make this prediction because I can simply look at how the U.S. military has 

ware used. 

Starting  more  than  4  years  ago  the  military  has  been  deploying  a  technology 
called  IP  Radio  to  allow  field  radios,  fixed  telephones,  encrypted  command  radios, 
laptops, and satellite radios to all interconnect. From the battlefield across the seas 
to the command centers right here. 

And,  this  is  a  technology,  not  a  single  product  from  a  single  equipment  vendor. 
Like  Google  and  Yahoo!,  this  technology  is  absolutely  independent  of  the  hard-

‘‘IP  Radio’’  means  sending  and  receiving  radio  traffic  on  Internet  hardware.  It 
works  by  connecting  together  existing  radio  systems.  Users  on  one  system  can  talk 
to users on another system. 

I will even go this far: if the public safety community operated with the command 
structure  of  the  U.S.  military,  we  wouldn’t  be  having  this  discussion  today  because 
firefighters,  EMTs  and  police  officers  throughout  the  U.S.  would  already  be  inter-
operable using IP Radio. 

Now you can see why it is not radical for me to predict that open, standards-based 

software will revolutionize public safety communications. 

And,  this  technology  can  dramatically  cut  the  cost  of  those  $1  billion  statewide 

radio systems. 

To  put  it  simply,  this  means  our  first  responders  will  be  able  to  use  any  radio 
they  can  afford—even  the  radios  they  already  have—and  be  interoperable  with  all 
of their state and Federal colleagues. 

I  respectfully  submit  that  this  Committee  can  make  interoperability  more  effec-
tive,  immediately,  by  mandating  the  use  of  open  standards,  software-based  radio 
systems. 

And  where  proprietary,  hardware-centric  systems  are  already  in  place,  you  could 
mandate full and open connectivity from those proprietary systems to the new open 
standards, software-based radio systems. 

Finally,  I  want  to  applaud  Chairman  Martin  of  the  FCC  for  his  comments  last 
week  to  this  Committee.  He  suggested  that  if  sufficient  funds  were  made  available 
now  for  fixed  and  portable  IP  Radio  networks,  then  interoperability  could  be  func-
tional  throughout  most  of  the  Nation  within  4  years.  I  agree  with  him  whole- 
heartedly. 

If I could leave you with a central message today, it would be this: 
First, let’s not assume that the traditional suppliers of radio systems with propri-

etary technology will offer the most desirable solutions. 

Second, if we want true interoperability, we need to move to an open, device-inde-
pendent,  standards-based,  software  so  that  the  majority  of  our  first  responders  can 
be included. 

Third,  IP  Radio,  already  embraced  elsewhere,  will  meet  several  of  our  most  crit-
ical  needs  immediately.  And  save  lives.  And  we  may  actually  be  able  to  afford  it. 

Thank you. I welcome your questions. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Chairman Billstrom. 
And now may I call on Chairman Desch?

STATEMENT OF MATTHEW J. DESCH, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, 

IRIDIUM SATELLITE, LLC 

Mr.  DESCH.  Good  morning,  Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman 

Stevens, and members of the Committee. 

My name is Matt Desch, and I am Chairman and CEO of Iridium 
Satellite, LLC. And I want to thank you for this opportunity to ap-
pear before you to discuss the state of our Nation’s emergency com-
munication network. 

Nearly  a  year  and  a  half  has  passed  since  the  disaster  wrought 
by  Hurricanes  Katrina  and  Rita,  but  the  images  of  those  days  in 
August and September 2005 are not easily forgotten. The Commit-
tee’s  efforts  since  then  to  ensure  that  our  communications  infra-
structure  is  fully  capable  before,  during,  and  after  disasters  is  to 
be applauded. 

The  FCC’s  around-the-clock  work  during  Katrina  to  ensure  that 
communication providers had the resources necessary for the recov-
ery  effort  is  also  to  be  applauded.  From  assisting  us  in  obtaining 
additional  spectrum  to  facilitating  Customs  entry  of  additional 
handsets, they worked in an efficient, cooperative, and professional 
manner.  We  want  to  thank  the  Commission  for  these  efforts,  and 
we  believe  that  the  FCC’s  Homeland  Security  Bureau  will  work 
closely  with  communication  providers  to  develop  even  more  suc-
cessful emergency communications solutions. 

Iridium’s network is uniquely suited to the communication needs 
of  first  responders.  Iridium  satellite  phones,  like  the  one  I  have  in 
front of me, require two things to complete a call. One is a charged 
battery, and two is a little bit of instruction, similar to the instruc-
tion needed when you purchase a new phone or a PDA. 

Unlike  other  systems,  the  Iridium  system  does  not  require  cell 
sites  or  other  infrastructure  on  the  ground.  The  network  can  be 
available anyplace, anytime, anywhere, including in the air and at 
sea, far from shore, which is why the U.S. military relies on us for 
its communication needs in Iraq and around the globe, and why we 
were  chosen  to  provide  the  communication  network,  for  example, 
for the U.S. Tsunami Warning System. 

As  part  of  our  global  coverage,  we  are  the  only  mobile  satellite 
provider  to  cover  both  Hawaii  and  all  of  Alaska,  with  significant 
ground  facilities  in  both  States.  And,  it’s  Iridium’s  experience  with 
disaster communications that leads us to support S. 385, the Inter-
operable Emergency Communications Act. 

The  challenge  now  is  to  provide  our  first  responders  with  both 
a  redundant  and  an  interoperable  emergency  communications  net-
work.  S.  385,  introduced  by  you,  Mr.  Chairman  with  the  support 
of Vice Chairman and Senators Kerry, Smith, and Snowe, takes on 
this challenge. 

The  bill  addresses  two  important  lessons  learned  from  these  re-
cent  disasters:  one,  the  need  to  create  a  strategic  communications 
reserve  to  have  communications  equipment  pre-positioned  and 
ready  to  use  in  an  emergency;  and,  second,  the  need  to  study  the 
creation  of  a  national  emergency  back-up  communications  system 
and  the  use  of  satellite  communications  as  an  element  of  that  sys-
tem.

We believe that it’s time for the Nation to create communication 
reserves  and  to  develop  a  national  backup  communications  system 
that includes a significant satellite component. 

Recent disasters make the need for S. 385 abundantly clear. The 
lack of communications equipment pre-positioned in the Gulf Coast 
region  hampered  the  relief  efforts  there  and  made  communication 
problems  there  worse  than  they  should  have  been.  Satellite  net-
works  were  often  the  only  networks  available  to  first  responders 
after  Katrina.  Iridium  and  other  satellite  providers  stripped  their 
stocks  bare  to  send  equipment  to  the  Gulf  Coast,  bringing  it  in 
from  around  the  globe.  Even  so,  we  had  to  turn  down  or  limit  re-
quests for equipment from public safety organizations. 

Beyond  the  lack  of  readily  available  equipment,  a  core  problem 
is  the  lack  of  an  integrated  communications  plan  that  embraces 
satellite.  As  FCC  Chairman  Martin  said  less  than  a  month  after 
Hurricane  Katrina  made  landfall,  ‘‘If  we  learned  anything  from 
Hurricane  Katrina,  it  is  that  we  cannot  solely  rely  on  terrestrial 
communications.’’ When the National Guard, the Red Cross, utility 
workers,  search-and-rescue  officials,  and  even  local  phone  compa-
nies obtained satellite phones, they told us they were able to carry 
out their missions more effectively. For example, the Red Cross de-
ployed  nine  specially-designed  emergency  response  vehicles  to  the 
Gulf  Coast,  each  equipped  with  ten  satellite  phones  and  portable 
VSAT  dishes.  The  First  U.S.  Army  division  relied  on  Iridium  sat-
ellite  phones  for  their  basic  voice  and  data  communication  needs 
while they were deployed in the region. Louisiana’s firefighters had 
constant  contact  with  their  headquarters  through  their  Iridium 
phones,  even  when  they  were  standing  in  the  knee-deep  waters  of 
New Orleans. 

Satellite  communications,  and,  in  particular,  satellite  phones, 
have  proven  their  value  in  an  emergency.  No  matter  the  damage 
on  the  ground  from  a  disaster,  including  floods,  earthquakes,  tor-
nados,  and  manmade  catastrophes,  first  responders  can  go  about 
their  duties  knowing  that  their  satellite  communications  system  is 
available. 

September 11th revealed the need for communications interoper-
ability. Hurricane Katrina did not diminish the need for interoper-
ability, but it made clear the overriding need for redundancy. Now, 
over  a  year  after  the  Gulf  Coast  disaster,  the  challenge  of  estab-
lishing a truly effective system still confronts us. If first responders 
do  not  have  communications  equipment  when  they  need  it  and 
where they need it, any system will be ineffective. A strategic com-
munication  reserve  that  provides  for  advance  placement  of  equip-
ment is a necessary step. 

The  Federal  Government  can  also  implement  several  additional 
steps  to  strengthen  the  Nation’s  emergency  communications.  One, 
you  could  expand  the  grant  program  created  last  year  that  gave 
money  to  hospitals  to  purchase  satellite  communications  equip-
ment.  Two,  you  should  consider  the  development  of  nonterrestrial 
emergency  communication  backup  systems  for  Federal  buildings. 
And, three, the Federal Government should make additional money 
available  to  public  safety  agencies  to  make  sure  that  they’re  ade-
quately  trained  to  use  their  communication  equipment  as  an  inte-
grated part of their response protocol.

I’d like to thank this committee for your efforts towards creating 
more  robust  emergency  communications.  And  I  think,  bills  like  S. 
385, will begin to shape the discussion. 

Thank you for your time. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Desch follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MATTHEW J. DESCH, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, 

IRIDIUM SATELLITE, LLC 

Good  morning  Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens,  and  members  of  the 
Committee.  My  name  is  Matt  Desch,  and  I  am  the  Chairman  and  CEO  of  Iridium 
Satellite,  LLC.  Iridium  played  a  vital  role  in  providing  emergency  communications 
after  Hurricane  Katrina,  and  I  am  very  grateful  to  be  here  today  to  talk  to  you 
about  the  state  of  the  Nation’s  emergency  communications  network.  Nearly  a  year 
and  a  half  has  passed  since  the  disaster  wrought  by  Hurricanes  Katrina  and  Rita, 
but the images of those days in August and September of 2005 are not easily forgot-
ten.  I  want  to  applaud  the  Committee  for  its  continuing  efforts  to  ensure  that  the 
Nation’s  communications  infrastructure  is  prepared  before,  during,  and  after  disas-
ters. 

During  Katrina,  the  effect  of  satellite  communications  was  greatly  enhanced  by 
the  swift  actions  of  the  Federal  Communications  Commission.  The  FCC  worked 
around-the-clock  to  ensure  that  providers  had  the  resources  available  to  assist  in 
the  recovery  effort.  From  assisting  us  in  obtaining  additional  spectrum  to  facili-
tating customs entry of additional handsets, they worked in an efficient, cooperative, 
and  professional  manner.  I  want  to  thank  the  Commission  for  these  actions,  and  I 
believe that the development of the Homeland Security Bureau within the Commis-
sion is an important step toward ensuring more effective emergency communications 
in the future. 

Iridium’s network is uniquely suited to the communications needs of first respond-
ers and the military. In fact, the Iridium’s system configuration is particularly effec-
tive in an emergency. Our network includes more than 66 orbiting satellites, ensur-
ing that every location in the U.S. and world, including both Hawaii and all of Alas-
ka,  is  served  by  an  Iridium  satellite  every  minute  of  every  day.  Iridium  is  the  only 
communications  system  that  has  this  universal  coverage.  We  also  have  significant 
ground facilities in both Hawaii and Alaska. 

We  are  the  primary  mobile  satellite  telephone  provider  to  the  U.S.  military  and 
thousands of Iridium handsets are in use everyday by our soldiers, marines, sailors, 
and  airmen  in  Iraq  and  around  the  globe.  We  also  serve  as  the  communications 
backbone for the Nation’s tsunami warning system in the Pacific Ocean. Iridium de-
livers  essential  services  to  users  who  need  communications  access  to  and  from  re-
mote areas where no other form of communication is available, including in the air 
and at sea far from shore. 

Through  a  satellite  phone  handset  or  small  data  device,  a  first  responder  is  able 
to  access  our  communications  network  that  is  positioned  hundreds  of  miles  above 
the  planet,  where  it  is  always  on  and  always  ready.  Unlike  any  other  network, 
Iridium’s  system  does  not  have  to  rely  on  vulnerable  ground  infrastructure  to  con-
nect  calls,  which  means  that  destruction  of  the  terrestrial  communications  infra-
structure  will  not  render  our  system  inoperable.  Iridium’s  satellite  phones  require 
two  things  to  complete  a  call:  (1)  a  charged  battery;  and  (2)  instruction  similar  to 
the  instruction  needed  when  you  purchase  a  new  phone  or  PDA.  Iridium  is  also 
interoperable with other communications devices such as land mobile radio through 
off-the-shelf  technology.  And  it  is  Iridium’s  experiences  with  disaster  communica-
tions that leads us to offer our wholehearted support of S. 385. 

Communications  are  the  essential  backbone  of  any  disaster  response  system.  If 
our  first  responders,  public  safety  personnel,  and  medical  professionals  cannot  talk 
to  one  another  over  a  functional,  effective,  and  secure  network  when  a  disaster 
strikes,  needless  lives  will  be  lost  and  needless  destruction  of  property  may  occur. 
Unfortunately,  the  very  events  that  can  so  adversely  affect  our  communities— 
whether  they  be  natural  or  man-made,  hurricanes  or  floods,  or  bombs  or  bullets— 
also often disrupt the basic infrastructure with which we communicate. The present 
emergency  communications  system  for  the  Nation  remains  vulnerable,  even  as  its 
limitations were revealed both by the September 11th attacks and by the 2005 Gulf 
Coast hurricanes. Major strides have been made in the last year and a half, but the 
challenge for the future is to provide our first responders with both a redundant and 
an  interoperable  emergency  communications  network  that  is  available  when  they 
need  it,  where  they  need  it.  By  taking  steps  to  ensure  that  first  responders  have

the proper communications equipment ready for a disaster, this Committee can also 
spur  business  adoption  of  appropriate  back-up  emergency  communications  equip-
ment. 

S.  385,  the  Interoperable  Emergency  Communications  Act  introduced  by  you  Mr. 
Chairman  with  the  support  of  the  Vice  Chairman  and  Senators  Kerry,  Smith,  and 
Snowe,  is  a  needed  and  necessary  step  toward  this  goal.  Iridium  is  proud  to  give 
this bill its support. This bill embraces two lessons learned from our Nation’s recent 
disasters that will dramatically strengthen the national emergency communications 
system: (1) the need to create strategic communications reserves in various locations 
around  the  Nation  so  that  communications  equipment  is  pre-positioned  and  ready 
for use when a disaster strikes; and (2) the need to explore the creation of a national 
emergency  communications  back-up  system  for  the  Nation,  including  an  evaluation 
of  the  use  of  a  non-terrestrial,  satellite-based  communications  component  for  that 
backup  system  (which  Iridium  believes  should  be  a  significant  component  of  such 
back-up  system).  This  Committee  should  act  quickly  to  report  S.  385.  Doing  so  will 
address two of the most obvious problems with the country’s emergency communica-
tions capabilities. 
Satellite’s Role in Emergency Communications 

Satellite  communications  networks  were  often  the  only  communications  network 
available  to  first  responders  in  the  Gulf  Coast  region  in  the  days  immediately  fol-
lowing  the  destructive  hurricanes  of  2005.  Hurricanes  Katrina  and  Rita  destroyed 
most  of  the  terrestrial  communications  systems  used  throughout  the  Gulf  Coast. 
Telephone wires simply vanished, and wireless towers had to have extensive repairs 
when the storms had passed before they were fully-functional. Even temporary com-
munications  solutions  such  as  fixed-line  phones  on  vehicular  platforms,  trucked-in 
cell  towers,  and  hastily-wired  emergency  shelters  took  days  and  sometimes  weeks 
to deploy. But there was never enough equipment for all affected communities, even 
when  these  stop-gap  measures  became  available.  Iridium  and  other  providers 
stripped  their  stocks  bare  to  send  equipment  to  the  Gulf  Coast,  bringing  it  in  from 
around the globe. Even so, mobile satellite providers had to turn down requests for 
equipment  from  public  safety  organizations,  and  give  other  public  safety  organiza-
tions,  including  the  House  Sergeant-at-Arms  office,  less  equipment  than  they  re-
quested. The lack of available communications equipment pre-positioned in the Gulf 
Coast region hampered relief efforts and made the communications problems in the 
region worse than they should have been. 

Beyond  that,  a  core  problem  in  the  emergency  communications  in  the  Gulf  Coast 
was  the  lack  of  an  integrated  emergency  communications  plan  that  embraced  sat-
ellite  communications.  As  the  Chairman  of  the  FCC  informed  this  Committee  less 
than a month after Hurricane Katrina made landfall, ‘‘[i]f we learned anything from 
Hurricane  Katrina,  it  is  that  we  cannot  rely  solely  on  terrestrial  communications. 
When  radio  towers  are  knocked  down,  satellite  communications  are,  in  some  in-
stances,  the  most  effective  means  of  communicating.’’  In  the  midst  of  this  catas-
trophe,  emergency  personnel  came  to  rely  on  satellite  phones  and  other  non-terres-
trial services for their vital communications needs. The reason for that reliance was 
clear—more  and  more  first  responders  found  that  satellite  provided  voice  and  data 
access when other networks simply could not. In fact Sulfur, Louisiana’s firefighters 
had  constant  contact  with  their  headquarters  through  their  Iridium  handsets,  even 
while standing in the knee-deep waters of New Orleans. 

What  worked  in  the  Gulf  Coast  immediately  after  the  hurricanes  was  satellite, 
which became a vital communications link that first responders found necessary as 
they  went  about  saving  lives.  Satellites  provided  the  redundancy,  ubiquity,  and  re-
siliency  that  were  unavailable  from  land-based  networks.  The  National  Guard,  the 
Red Cross, utility workers, search and rescue officials, and even local phone compa-
nies turned to mobile satellite phones and terminals in the minutes, hours, and days 
after the hurricane struck. For example: 

• The  Red  Cross  deployed  9  specially-designed  Emergency  Response  Vehicles  to 
the  Gulf  Coast,  each  equipped  with  10  satellite  phones  and  portable,  tripod 
mounted VSAT satellite dishes. 
• The First U.S. Army Division, based on its disaster recovery experience in Flor-
ida  and  other  locations  in  the  United  States,  relied  on  Iridium  satellite  phones 
while deployed to the Gulf Coast for their basic voice and data communications 
needs, knowing that other terrestrial options would be inoperable. 
• Air  evacuation  teams  used  the  Iridium  communications  system  to  track  heli-
copters  when  they  were  in  the  air  and  to  transmit  data  on  incoming  patients. 
According  to  the  President  and  CEO  of  Air  Evac  Lifeteam,  which  deployed  to 
the  Gulf  Coast  in  the  hours  after  Katrina  hit:  ‘‘We  knew  where  our  ships  were 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:58 Oct 06, 2010 Jkt 039473 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39473.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

39 

at all times. We were able to send and receive text messages in real-time when 
other  modes  of  communication  failed—our  crews  and  our  communicators  were 
able  to  exchange  timely  information,  which  enhanced  both  the  safety  and  the 
effectiveness of our mission.’’ 

Today,  the  private  sector  is  working  with  Iridium  to  provide  a  more  permanent 
emergency communications capability for their operations. And that capability is re-
liant  upon  the  redundancy  and  effectiveness  of  satellite  communications.  Two  cur-
rent Iridium projects illustrate this fact: 

• Iridium’s communications network is being used as the backbone for a new sys-
tem  that  provides  in-flight,  on-demand  medical  assistance  during  airborne 
emergencies.  The  network  provides  flight  crew  with  a  direct  link  to  physicians 
who have been specially-trained in remote airborne diagnosis and treatment. 
• MedStar  Health,  the  primary  Washington,  D.C.  hospital  operator,  has  chosen 
the Iridium system to serve as its corporate backup emergency communications 
provider.  Iridium  phones  will  be  deployed  throughout  MedStar’s  medical  net-
work  to  ensure  that  communications  services  will  be  available  at  all  times.  Ac-
cording to Dr. Christopher Wuerker of MedStar, ‘‘As a vital community medical 
services  provider,  it  is  critically  important  that  we  have  redundant  layers  of 
backup  communications.’’  Iridium  equipment  is  also  used  in  MedStar’s  medical 
transport helicopters to provide tracking and voice communications systems. 

The move to satellite communications equipment for emergency situations makes 
perfect  sense—widespread  and  catastrophic  damage  on  the  ground,  or  the  remote-
ness of a particular location, simply does not impact a satellite communications net-
work located in space. No matter where disaster occurs, mobile satellite communica-
tions  equipment  can  be  immediately  available  for  critical  communications  needs. 
Satellite  communications  systems  also  offer  first  responders  and  public  safety  per-
sonnel  the  interoperability  they  so  desperately  need.  The  satellite  industry  is  al-
ready offering interoperable communications options to first responders. 

Satellite  communications,  and  in  particular  satellite  phones,  have  proven  their 
value in an emergency. Where they are available and used as part of an integrated 
emergency communications plan, they provide first responders with an effective and 
redundant  communications  capability  from  the  moment  a  disaster  strikes.  No  mat-
ter the damage on the ground from a disaster, including flooding, earthquakes, tor-
nados,  and  man-made  catastrophes,  first  responders  can  go  about  their  duties  with 
the  knowledge  that  they  will  have  all  the  information  they  need  provided  through 
a  satellite  communications  system.  Unfortunately,  the  current  lack  of  readily-avail-
able satellite communications equipment and the lack of an integrated plan for their 
deployment  and  use  continue  to  hamper  the  Nation’s  emergency  communications 
system. 
The Future of Emergency Communications for the Nation 

The  realization  that  the  American  communications  system  was  not  ready  for  a 
disaster  was  never  more  evident  than  on  September  11th,  when  stories  surfaced 
about the lack of interoperable equipment available to the heroes who responded to 
the catastrophe at the World Trade Center. Hurricane Katrina reinforced that real-
ization  4  years  later,  revealing  not  only  that  the  American  emergency  communica-
tions  system  lacked  interoperability  but  that  it  also  lacked  redundancy.  Now,  over 
a  year  after  the  Gulf  Coast  disaster,  the  challenge  of  establishing  a  truly  effective 
national emergency communications system still confronts us. S. 385 embraces that 
challenge. 

No matter how successful any particular emergency communications system is, if 
it  is  not  in  the  hands  of  first  responders  or  ready  in  times  of  need,  it  will  never 
be  as  effective  as  it  could  be.  The  key  for  the  Nation  is  to,  in  the  immortal  words 
of  the  Boy  Scouts,  ‘‘Be  Prepared.’’  Iridium,  like  other  communications  companies, 
stands  ready  to  answer  the  call  in  an  emergency.  When  Hurricane  Katrina  struck, 
Iridium  personnel  worked  overtime  to  get  Iridium  phones  into  the  hands  of  those 
first  responders  who  lacked  operable  communications  equipment.  But  these  efforts 
were hampered by the same infrastructure destruction that made other communica-
tions  systems  inoperable  and  the  need  to  transport  equipment  across  the  Nation  to 
the disaster area. 

The  efforts  were  also  hampered  by  the  economic  reality  that  in  times  of  emer-
gency,  there  is  never  a  large  enough  stock  of  equipment  to  get  it  in  the  hands  of 
everyone  that  needs  it.  A  strategic  communications  reserve  that  provides  for  ad-
vanced  placement  of  communications  equipment  is  a  necessary  step  in  the  develop-
ment  of  a  national  emergency  communications  plan.  The  grants  established  in  S. 
385,  which  provide  for  up  to  $100  million  total  for  strategic  placement  of  commu-

nications  equipment  across  the  Nation,  will  make  available  the  funds  necessary  to 
make  sure  that  communications  equipment  is  ready  and  available  when  needed 
where needed. 

The basic reality of the present national emergency communications system, how-
ever,  is  that  it  is  over-reliant  on  terrestrial  systems,  the  same  systems  that  were 
proven  fallible  along  the  Gulf  Coast.  This  is  not  an  issue  of  equipment  availability 
or even interoperability; it is an issue of redundancy and effectiveness. That is why 
Iridium supports the measures outlined in S. 385 to study the development of a na-
tional emergency communications backup system. We also thank the Chairman and 
the Vice Chairman, and the other co-sponsors of the bill, for including satellite com-
munications  systems  in  the  study  of  that  backup  system.  For  it  is  satellite  commu-
nications  that  offers  the  best  chance  of  creating  a  ‘‘resilient  interoperable  commu-
nications  system  for  first  responders.’’  It  is  beyond  time  for  the  Nation  to  consider 
creating a national emergency communications backup system. And Iridium is com-
mitted to assisting that study in any way possible. 

The  Federal  Government  can  also  implement  additional  steps  to  strengthen  the 
state  of  the  Nation’s  emergency  communications  system.  Iridium  would  like  to  see 
the  Federal  Government  expand  the  grant  program  created  last  year  which  gave 
money  to  hospitals  in  the  Gulf  Coast  states  to  purchase  satellite  communications 
equipment for use during emergencies. This program will bring vitally-needed com-
munications  equipment  to  these  hospitals,  but  there  is  no  reason  to  limit  the  pro-
gram  to  the  Gulf  Coast.  Other  hospitals  need  these  communications  links  for  the 
times  when  other  communications  alternatives  may  not  be  available.  Having  this 
equipment could literally be the difference between life and death. 

The Federal Government’s own communications networks are also in dire need of 
a backup system. The communications network for Capitol Hill and in Federal Gov-
ernment  buildings  around  the  Nation  is  almost  exclusively  reliant  on  terrestrial 
communications  systems.  If  a  disaster  on  the  magnitude  of  Hurricane  Katrina  ever 
struck  Washington,  D.C.,  the  Federal  Government  could  very  well  be  without  basic 
voice  and  data  communications  in  the  minutes,  hours,  and  days  immediately  fol-
lowing  the  disaster  because  the  local  terrestrial  communications  infrastructure  has 
been  destroyed.  Iridium  believes  that  the  Committee  should  consider  the  develop-
ment  of  a  non-terrestrial  emergency  communications  backup  system  for  Federal 
buildings.  Much  like  the  MedStar  system,  an  emergency  backup  based  on  satellite 
communications would provide the Federal Government with the safety and security 
of knowing that communications would be available in a time of need. 

Finally,  training  is  a  vital  component  of  any  emergency  communications  system. 
It is not enough to simply give a first responder a satellite phone, or any other com-
munications  device,  and  tell  them  to  ‘‘go  to  your  job.’’  Modern  emergency  commu-
nications  systems  are  so  much  more  than  a  means  of  voice  communication.  For  in-
stance,  the  real-time  data  transmission  available  over  the  Iridium  system  can  put 
a  host  of  information  at  the  hands  of  a  first  responder,  particularly  if  they  are  de-
ployed to areas they are not already familiar with or into situations that are contin-
ually  in  flux.  We  need  to  make  sure  that  first  responders  understand  the  immense 
capabilities of the equipment that they are given and can incorporate and use those 
capabilities when they are in emergency situations. The Federal Government should 
make  money  available  to  public  safety  agencies  to  ensure  that  they  are  adequately 
trained  to  use  their  emergency  communications  equipment  as  an  integrated  part  of 
their response protocol. 
Conclusion 

I would like to thank this Committee for its efforts toward creating a more robust 
emergency communications network for the Nation. As we have seen time and time 
again, effective emergency communications is essential during a disaster. This Com-
mittee  has  made  emergency  communications  a  priority,  and  bills  like  S.  385  will 
begin to shape the type of emergency communications system that will be available 
to  our  first  responders  when  even  the  most  devastating  natural  or  man-made  dis-
aster  confronts  us.  Strategic  deployment  of  communications  equipment  will  ensure 
that equipment is ready the minute disaster strikes. And a national emergency com-
munications  backup  system,  particularly  one  that  contains  a  non-terrestrial  compo-
nent, will provide first responders with the redundant communications systems they 
need to do their job efficiently and effectively. 

I  can  assure  the  Committee  that  each  Iridium  employee  takes  seriously  the  vital 
role  that  we  play  as  the  piece  of  the  Nation’s  communications  infrastructure  that 
never goes down. To that end, we continue to add functionality based on the lessons 
learned from each disaster recovery operation and on the recommendations of public 
safety  personnel.  We  also  continue  to  work  with  the  FCC  to  ensure  that  we  have 
the necessary spectrum to expand and improve our system. Our Nation’s emergency

communications  system  is  getting  better,  but  we  have  not  yet  embraced  all  of  the 
lessons  learned  from  America’s  recent  disasters.  We  can  all  do  more  to  assist  our 
first  responders,  and  Iridium,  with  its  satellite  phones  and  communications  net-
work,  stands  poised  to  aid  in  any  way  necessary.  Thank  you  again  for  letting  me 
testify  before  you  today,  and  I  will  be  happy  to  answer  any  questions  you  might 
have. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
And  now  I  would  like  to  thank  the  panel  and  call  upon  Senator 

Stevens for a round of questions. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman. 
And I hope the Committee and everyone—will excuse me for going 
back a little bit in history before we consider this problem. 

Howard  Baker  used  to  say,  ‘‘If  you  don’t  toot  your  own  horn,  no 
one’s  going  to  toot  it.’’  When  I  was  the  solicitor  in  the  Interior  De-
partment,  I  found  that  the  oil  and  gas  leases  that  were  released 
were  put  into  a  little  box,  and  they  allowed  people  to  have  an  op-
portunity  to  participate  in  the  drawing  that  took  place.  And  they 
would draw a name out of a hat, and that name got the lease, and 
they turned around and sold it for a couple of million dollars to the 
oil industry. I was very surprised when I got on this subcommittee, 
this Commerce subcommittee here on communications, to find that 
when spectrum became available because of a failure or otherwise, 
the  same  thing  was  taking  place,  lottery.  Twenty-five  bucks  and 
you had your chance to get a piece of spectrum. And at times, that 
was sold for $100 million. 

Joined  by  my  friend,  we  provided  the  concept  of  auctioning  the 
spectrum.  I  remember  too  well  the  day  that  we  got  the  first  auc-
tion, and it was about $18 billion. And I called the FCC Chairman 
and said, ‘‘Don’t you have, over there, one of those reward systems 
so that anyone that makes a suggestion that increase income to the 
government—he  gets  a  share?’’  And  he  says,  ‘‘Yes,  we  do.’’  And  I 
said, ‘‘Where’s my check?’’ 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  STEVENS.  And  he  said,  ‘‘You’re  not  a  government  em-

[Laughter.] 
Senator  STEVENS.  But,  in  any  event,  what  I’m  saying  is,  this 
spectrum  as  most  of  you  have  said,  is  public.  We  passed  an  Act 
that  allocated  the  income  from  when  this  spectrum  is  sold.  The 
first  part  of  it  goes  to  a  general  reduction  of  the  deficit—over  half 
of  it.  The  first  responders  for  interoperability  got  the  next  billion 
dollars.  But  we  also  allocated  money  to  the  analog  converter  box 
program,  to  the  New  York  City  9-1-1  digital  transition  problems, 
the low-power TV transitional digital-to-analog conversion, the low- 
power transfer to upgrade program, the national alert and tsunami 
warning  program,  the  9-1-1  program  enhancement,  and  Essential 
Air Service Program interoperability. 

So, what you’ve suggested now, as I see it, is that we have about, 
I think, 84 megahertz here. You have 24 already. I’m told there are 
60  left  to  auction.  You’re  suggesting  that  30  of  it  be  turned  over 
to this trust, and that the trust then would operate that and make 
it available to the various initial responders. I think the most seri-
ous  problem  in  the  country  today  is  interoperability  and  assuring 

ployee.’’

that  we  have  total  interoperability  in  all  forms  for  the  areas  that 
you represent. 

But  I  have  some  serious  questions  about  this.  You  made  the 
statement,  Mr.  O’Brien,  ‘‘If  this  disturbs  the  $1  billion,  it  disturbs 
the  allocation  system,  then  we  shouldn’t  do  it.’’  But,  by  definition, 
it’s going to. We predicted we would have at least $10 billion in in-
come  from  this  spectrum.  I’m  told  it  could  be  much  more.  But  if 
you  take  half  of  it  out  and  then  we  end  up  with  a  situation  where 
half  the  spectrum  is  not  subject  to  being  controlled  in  the  public 
interest  in  the  future  by  this  program  we’ve  already  allocated, 
we’re  going  to  have  to  change  the  existing  law.  We  will  have  to 
take  money  away  from  system  interoperability,  the  analog  con-
verter box, all those other things, and those programs are planned 
on taking part of this money, too. 

I don’t understand, in view of the fact you have 24 megahertz al-
ready  allocated  to  public  safety,  why  we  should  turn  another  30 
megahertz  over  to  a  trust.  That  can  be  used  for  public  safety  to 
lease  it  to  the  public  sector.  This  is  creating  a  new  FCC,  isn’t  it, 
Mr. O’Brien? 

Mr. O’BRIEN. Senator, let me answer your question, please. 
First  of  all,  we  propose  that  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust 
be created by legislation—it will require legislation—and that that 
legislation authorize—— 

Senator STEVENS. I know—I’ve only got 5 minutes. Now, tell me, 

won’t it have the impact I said? 
Mr. O’BRIEN. No, sir, it won’t. 
Senator STEVENS. Why? 
Mr.  O’BRIEN.  Because  we’re  proposing  that  the  Public  Safety 

Broadband Trust pay $5 billion for that spectrum—— 

Senator STEVENS. But you’re—— 
Mr. O’BRIEN.—so that there won’t—— 
Senator STEVENS.—assuming that that’s—— 
Mr. O’BRIEN.—be a shortfall. 
Senator STEVENS. What if it would auction for a lot more? 
Mr. O’BRIEN. The point is—— 
Senator  STEVENS.  No,  no,  we  have  a  series  of  proposals  already 
in law, where the money goes. I believe we propose we’ll get some-
thing  like,  a  minimum,  $10  billion—most  people  think  it’ll  be  $15 
billion,  according  to  CBO.  If  we  give  half  of  it  to  you,  the  most  we 
could possibly get would be $5 to $7.5 billion. The first billion goes 
to  you,  anyway.  We  have  to  cut  out  at  least  half  of  the  people  al-
ready expecting, under the law, a portion of that income, right? 

Mr.  O’BRIEN.  My  understanding  of  the  CBO  number  is  that  it’s 
slightly  higher  than  $10  billion,  and  that’s  why  we’re  proposing 
meeting $5 billion by raising money in the—— 

Senator STEVENS. Well, but—— 
Mr. O’BRIEN.—private capital markets, so that none of those pro-

grams would be affected. 

Senator  STEVENS.  CBO’s  projection  of  the  first  auction  was 
$7.5—$750  million;  $18  billion  came  in.  Now,  you’re  saying  that 
we’re  going  to  locked  in  by  the  CBO  estimate?  But  if  you  cut  the 
spectrum  in  half,  I  believe  the  total  will  be  less,  because  you’re 
going  to  be  leasing  your  spectrum  in  competition  with  the  people 
that  want  to  bid.  I  really  believe  you—I  can’t  take  any  more  time.

I  guess  I’ll  get  back  another  time,  Mr.  Chairman.  But  I  do  think, 
you  know,  the  idea  is  great.  We  have  to  find  a  way  to  deal  with 
interoperability.  But  we  also  have  to  think  first  of  preserving  the 
right of the public to have the full control over this spectrum in the 
future.  Yours  would  take  half  of  the  spectrum  and  turn  it  over  to 
a trust, which we would never get back into the FCC. 

Mr. O’BRIEN. Well, but, Senator, if the spectrum is auctioned, it’s 

gone forever. 

Senator STEVENS. No, it isn’t. 
Mr. O’BRIEN. The spectrum is—— 
Senator  STEVENS.  It’s  only  gone  until  someone  gives  up  or  fails 
or anything. All of this stuff came back because of a change in pol-
icy.  What  if  there’s  a  change  in  technology?  I’m  told  there  is  a 
change  in  technology  coming.  And  the  broadband  people  can  tell 
you more about that. 

Mr.  O’BRIEN.  Well,  but  I  believe—I’m—it’s  always  been  my  un-
derstanding that the spectrum that’s auctioned is pretty much gone 
to the licensee, unless the licensee misbehaves. 

Senator STEVENS. I’ll close—— 
Mr. O’BRIEN. And—— 
Senator  STEVENS.  When  I  was  a  kid,  I  invented  one  of  those  ra-
dios  that  you  have  to  dial.  We’d  go  5  degrees  this  way  and  5  de-
grees that way in order to find the point where we could catch the 
radio. Okay? 

Mr. O’BRIEN. Yes. 
Senator  STEVENS.  It  took  10  degrees  to  pick  up  on  a  crystal  set. 
Now,  you  take  1  degree  of  spectrum  and  it’s  divided  into  10  al-
ready, maybe 100 with some new technology. I believe spectrum is 
going  to  continue  to  increase  in  value  if  we  use  it  properly  and 
keep the control at the FCC. 

Mr. O’BRIEN. Well, but so do I. With all due respect, I think that 
the  proposal  to  put  the  spectrum  in  a  Public  Safety  Broadband 
Trust, which is controlled long term by representatives of State and 
local and Federal; is a much better return to the public. 

Senator STEVENS. I’ve got to disagree with you. Spectrum is sub-
ject  to  license.  It  is  public  property.  We  have  never  given  it  away. 
We’ve  never  sold  it  completely.  We’ve  provided  the  right  to  use  it 
if the licensee has a license. But he does not have ownership of this 
property. You would get ownership of this property under this pro-
posal. 

Mr.  O’BRIEN.  No,  Senator,  we’re  proposing  that  the  rights—the 
licensee  rights,  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust,  would  be  iden-
tical to the licensee rights of any other licensee, and—— 

Senator  STEVENS.  That’s  not  what  your  statement  says.  You  say 
you  continue  to  lease  it  when  you’re  not  using  it.  Today,  if  you’re 
not using part of your spectrum, FCC can come in and have an op-
portunity  to  bring  about  sharing  of  that.  That  could  not  happen 
under your proposal. 

Mr.  O’BRIEN.  There  is  no  aspect  of  our  proposal  which  would 

change the relationship between the FCC and the licensee, sir. 

Senator STEVENS. I’ve taken too much time. I’ll come back. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Klobuchar?

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, 
Mr. McEwen, for your kind comments about our retired sheriff and 
the good work he has done on interoperability. 

I  just  wanted  to  follow  up  a  little  on  what  Senator  Stevens  was 
asking  about,  in  a  more  narrow  question,  and  then  a  bigger  one. 
I  know  that  the  proposal  that’s  being  discussed—the  spectrum, 
Senator  McCain’s  proposal,  would  have  mixed  public  safety  and 
commercial  use.  And  I  just  wanted  people  to  talk  a  little  bit  about 
that  idea,  if  you  see  problems  with  it,  what  are  the  strengths  and 
weaknesses of mixing the use with the spectrum? 

Mr.  MCEWEN.  Well,  first  of  all,  let  me  just  say  that  the  concept 
here  that  we  are  supporting,  the  public  safety  community  is  sup-
porting, is that this spectrum would be allocated to the public safe-
ty  community  under  this  proposal  as  a  trust.  That  means  that  it’s 
in  the  same  category,  Senator  as  any  other  kinds  of  allocations.  I 
mean,  it’s  never—it  never  belongs  to  anybody,  it’s  always  the 
public’s—it  has  control  over  it.  But  the  fact  is  that,  in  this  par-
ticular  case,  the  concept  is  that  this  spectrum  would  be  managed 
by public safety. We would have a controlling interest in the board 
of  directors  of  the  trust.  And  the  commercial  interests  would  then 
build and manage this under our direction and control. 

The  idea  here  is  that  the  commercial  spectrum—the  spectrum 
would  be  actually  used  primarily—a  lot  of  the  spectrum  would  be 
used by the commercial interests, with public safety always having 
access  to  it  and  priority  whenever  they  needed  it.  That’s  the  con-
cept  with  getting  private  investors  to  build  this  network.  We  have 
no  money,  we  have  no—if  we  depend  upon  you  to  fund  this,  it’ll 
never happen, because you don’t have the unlimited resources that 
we  would  need  to  build  this.  You  know,  we’ve  talked  about  how 
many billions of dollars it might cost—— 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  But  wouldn’t  a  piece  of  this  also  involve  a 

Mr. MCEWEN. Pardon? 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Wouldn’t a piece of this also involve a loan 

from the Government? No? 

Mr. MCEWEN. Yes, but—— 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. You were—— 
Mr.  MCEWEN.—the  point  is  that  the  spectrum  is  worth  some 
money, as the Senator—Senator Stevens has just referred to. What 
it’s  worth,  I’m  not  quite  sure.  But—$5  billion,  whatever—but  the 
fact  is,  that  value  of  that  spectrum  doesn’t  go  away.  If  something 
happens  that,  in  some  way,  this  fails,  that  spectrum  still  belongs 
to the public. We—I mean, you don’t give that spectrum away. 

Mr. O’BRIEN. May I—— 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Jump right in, then Mr. O’Brien. 
Mr.  O’BRIEN.  All  right,  certainly.  May  I  clarify  just  a  couple  of 

loan? 

things? 

The  first  one  is  the  beauty  of  where  technology  is  taking  us  in 
next-generation  wireless  technology.  The  so-called  fourth  genera-
tion, which is IP-based, allows on a software basis different quality 
of  service,  so  you  can  share  capacity  between  public  safety  and 
commercial, while always preserving the primary interest of public 
safety.  And  so,  it  breaks  through  the  classic  problem  that,  when 
spectrum is reserved for public safety, there’s some amount of lack 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:58 Oct 06, 2010 Jkt 039473 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39473.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

45 

of  utilization  of  it,  while  public  safety  is,  sort  of,  waiting  for  the 
next  big  event.  This  solves  that  problem  by  saying  the  capacity 
that’s  generated  on  the  system  is  always  available  first  to  public 
safety, but then to commercial, so that you get the maximum utili-
zation of it, using the technology. 

The  second  point  is  that  we  are  proposing  not  loans,  but  loan 
guarantees, to the Public Safety Broadband Trust. By using the le-
verage  that’s  created  when  it  gets  this  license,  it  can  go  into  the 
capital  markets  and  actually  raise  the  money.  So,  the  $5  billion  is 
not  a  loan.  It’s  raised  in  the  capital  markets,  but  to  lower  the  cost 
of borrowing it, we’re asking, or proposing, that there be loan guar-
antees to the Public Safety Broadband Trust. And that’s just to ac-
quire  the  spectrum.  The  build-out  would  not  be  loans.  The  build- 
out  would  be  investment—private  capital  investing  in  a  next-gen-
eration wireless network. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you. 
Mr.  LARGENT.  Senator,  I’d  just  like  to  say  that—first  of  all,  that 
some people have viewed our testimony here today as being adver-
sarial with public safety. And I just want to say, first and foremost, 
it  is  not  adversarial.  We  don’t  have  that  kind  of  relationship  with 
public safety, because we believe in what they do. We were up here 
on the Hill for the last several years to ensure that the DTV transi-
tion bill actually was passed into law, so that public safety got the 
billion dollars that Congress already enacted, that we get this spec-
trum  to  use  for  public  safety.  They’re  getting  24  megahertz  in  the 
current  language  of  the  bill,  and  that  doubles  what  they  have 
today. And it’s contiguous spectrum that they can do a lot of things 
with. And so, I would just say that, up front, there’s not the conflict 
that many have perceived between CTIA and our membership and 
public safety. But what we’re trying to do is ensure that what Con-
gress has set out to do—and I would mention that what they have 
done is deliver 24 megahertz of spectrum to public safety, which is 
a significant piece of spectrum, and they have applied a billion dol-
lars to start this process for public safety. And those were two—— 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  But  how  much  do  you  think  it  would  cost 
to  make—I  mean,  there  are—some  estimates  are  $15  billion.  The 
President’s  going  backward  in  his  budget  on  this.  I  mean,  how 
much do you think this would really cost? 

Mr. LARGENT. That’s—I have no idea. And the billion dollars, I’m 
saying,  is  just  a  downpayment  to  get  them  started.  And  they’re 
going  to  need  more  money  in  the  future.  And  we  admit  that.  But 
these  are  two  really  key  suggestions  that  were  made  by  the  9/11 
Commission—24 megahertz is what public safety needed, and a bil-
lion  dollars  to  get  them  started—those  were  the  exact  increments 
that  the  9/11  Commission  made  for  public  safety.  And  this  Con-
gress has delivered that for public safety. 

Now,  they’re  talking  about  delivering  broadband  and  all  these 
other types of things. And I think there’s additional spectrum that 
could  be  available  for  public  safety  in  the  future.  But  it’s  wrong 
to—I think it’s wrong to take something off the table that took 10— 
over  10  years  to  get  passed  through  Congress,  the  DTV  transition 
bill, take it off the table and try to rejigger it now right before the 
auction  is  to  be  held  later  this  year.  That’s  going  to  create  some 
significant problems.

Mr.  O’BRIEN.  Senator,  let  me  just  take  1  minute  and  try  to  ex-
plain  why  I  think  this  is  such  a  compelling  necessity  for  Congress 
to consider there now. 

The proposal we’ve laid out, for the first time, creates a self-sus-
taining  business  model  for  public  safety  communications  now  and 
into  the  future.  Yes,  it  requires  spectrum.  It  requires  spectrum, 
which  has  a  tremendous  value.  Nobody  would  disagree  with  the 
tremendous  value  of  the  spectrum.  But  we  find  compelling  the  ob-
servation  that  today,  in  doing  their  jobs,  men  and  women  in  the 
first-responder  services  have  devices  which  their  lives  sometimes 
depend  on  and  which  all  of  us  sitting  here  know  are  inferior.  Our 
proposal  is  not  to  create  interoperability,  except  as  a  byproduct. 
Our  proposal  is  to  bring  public  safety  first  responders  to  the  fore-
front  of  wireless  communications.  It  cannot  be  done  without  spec-
trum. It cannot be done without significant money—billions of dol-
lars.  We  can  walk  through  with  you  the  model.  We  can  show  you 
dollars and cents, and what it will take to cover 99.3 percent of the 
U.S. population. It is somewhere in the neighborhood of $20 billion. 
The capital markets, the private capital markets, we are confident, 
will  support  that  type  of  a  build-out  on  a  shared-spectrum  basis. 
This  is  a  unique  opportunity.  There  is  obviously  a  misunder-
standing  between  myself  and  Senator  Stevens  on  how  we  propose 
this  spectrum  go  to  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust.  I  hope  I 
will  be  able  to  clarify  that  misunderstanding.  But  I  can’t  not  take 
the  opportunity  to  say:  focus  on  the  money.  Where  is  the  money 
coming from to bring these devices to the men and women who are 
risking their lives? It will not come, it is not coming, it hasn’t come, 
from  any  level  of  government,  and  it’s  not  going  to  come  from 
there.  And  it  hasn’t  come  from  the  commercial  wireless  sector, 
which  has  had  25  years  to  address  it.  They  have  not  addressed  it. 
It  is  not  their  function  to  address  it.  It  is  their  function  to  make 
money  for  the  shareholders  of  their  companies,  which  is  a  fine 
thing, but very different from what we’re discussing. 

Thank you so much. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you so much. 
Senator Cantwell? 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  thank  you, 

panelists. 

It  seems  to  me  that  we’re  talking  about  the  same  things  here, 
but  we’re  talking  about  two  different  approaches.  One  is  this  top- 
down  spectrum  issue,  and,  in  the  meantime,  you’re  over  there 
bootstrapping a model that is, getting this done today. I am curious 
about  how  far  you  think  that  we  can  go  with  RoIP  to  successfully 
build  the  interoperability.  You  seem  to  be  saying,  ‘‘Don’t  get  so 
hung  up  on  the  hardware.  Focus  on  the  software  interoperability 
solution.’’  So,  if  IP  packets  are  delivered  up  to  satellites  and  down 
to microwave dishes and then down to handheld communication de-
vices, and there is an IP wrapper there, and it can be secure, isn’t 
what  you’re  discussing  right  now,  that’s  taking  place  in  various

parts  of  the  State,  the  interoperability  that  we  need,  regardless  of 
spectrum, regardless of devices? 

Mr. BILLSTROM. That’s right, Senator. The concept of IP Radio is 
really  orthogonal  to  the  issues  of  spectrum.  And,  as  you  just  de-
scribed,  there  are  the  issues  of  how  communications  occurs  at  the 
very lowest level, at the hardware level. 

If  I  was  making  a  criticism,  it  was  over  the  traditional  trunking 
radio  technology,  that  is  proprietary  and  closed,  that  the  P25  pro-
gram  has  attempted  to  address.  But,  unfortunately,  P25  is  not 
standard  across  the  United  States  yet,  and  those  proprietary  sys-
tems are still in place. 
IP Radio offers—— 
Senator  CANTWELL.  Is  that  part  of  Homeland  Security?  Is  that 

what you’re saying? 

Mr. BILLSTROM. Yes. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  And  so,  Homeland  Security  is  still  favoring 
hardware  technology  that  is—doesn’t  have  the  interoperability  IP 
capabilities—— 

Mr. BILLSTROM. They—— 
Senator CANTWELL.—that might be so universal. 
Mr. BILLSTROM. That’s correct. And, in their defense, they’ve not 
been presented with an opportunity that’s different. So, there really 
is no other alternative for them today. 

Senator CANTWELL. So, where would you—— 
Mr.  BILLSTROM.  If  a  public  safety  agency  wants  to  buy  a  new 
radio,  and  if  they  need  to  support  more  users  or  more  capability, 
their choices are fairly limited. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  So,  where  would  you  go  from  here,  then,  on 

taking RoIP interoperability to the next level? 

Mr. BILLSTROM. I would—— 
Senator  CANTWELL.  What  are  the  barriers  in  breaking  that 
down?  And  what  do  you  think,  specifically,  of  Mr.  O’Brien’s  idea? 
Mr. BILLSTROM. I think the idea of a new carrier is a very excit-
ing one, and I’m not qualified to comment on it. I see pros and cons 
to  both.  I  also  see  IP  Radio  as  something  we  can  do  immediately 
as  an  interim  step,  at  least,  if  not  a  method  of  integration  for  all 
of  the  different  radio  technologies.  I  can,  in  fact,  imagine  a  world 
where  we  have  old  trunking  radio  systems  still  being  used  by  a 
city,  new  technology  of  the  type  that  Cyren  Call  is  discussing,  and 
military radios, all of which need to interoperate. And the only way 
to connect all three of those technologies right now is IP Radio, and 
the military is already doing it. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Could  you  just  explain  the  cost  differential, 

from the bootstrap model up, versus—— 

Mr. BILLSTROM. Sure, I’ve heard an estimate as low as $300 mil-
lion  to  provide  interoperability  across  the  entire  United  States 
within the next 4 years. 

Senator CANTWELL. And—— 
Mr.  BILLSTROM.  That’s  obviously  less  than  the  cost  of  a  single 

State as they’ve already been done. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  I  think  you  said  a  billion  dollars  per  State 

was what you were saying—— 

Mr. BILLSTROM. Roughly a billion is a good number.

Senator CANTWELL. So, I’d be curious about the barriers that you 
think  that  we  need  to  break  down  so  that  we  can  continue  those 
bootstrap models of existing technology and using RoIP, because it 
seems  to  me  that  if  it’s  worked  in  so  many  other  things,  and  it’s 
working  for  the  military  now,  that  it  holds  great  promise.  And  I 
should say, to be specific, I think what you’re trying to say is more 
that open-architecture software has the—— 

Mr. BILLSTROM. Absolutely. 
Senator CANTWELL. Is that correct? 
Mr.  BILLSTROM.  Absolutely.  Open  architecture  has  changed  the 
world  of  computing  and  has  touched  everyone  in  this  room,  but  it 
hasn’t, in public safety. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Well,  thank  you.  Before  I  go  on  to  Mr. 
O’Brien  could  you  just  comment  on  where  we  are  with  the  Cana-
dians on this 800 megahertz issue and what we need to do? Do we 
need  to  get  the  State  Department  to  move  faster  on  this—working 
with the Canadian Government on resolving this issue for the 2010 
Olympics? 

Mr. BILLSTROM. Yes. Not everyone in this room may be aware of 
it, but in the radio industry, when we try to license a new channel, 
just  a  single  new  channel  for  one  radio  anywhere  along  the  Cana-
dian  border,  the  time  that  it  takes  to  get  that  license  through  the 
FCC  and  then  through  Canada  and  enable  a  public  safety  agency 
to  go  on  the  air  is  measured  in  years.  It’s  measured  in  years.  In 
fact,  applications  made  this  week  would  probably  not  be  finished 
until after the Olympics were over. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Thank  you.  So,  we  have  to,  obviously,  work 

with the State Department. 

Mr. O’Brien, did you want to add comment there? 
Mr.  O’BRIEN.  I’d  like  to  just  clarify  one  thing.  Senator  Software 
used  to  improve  the  interoperability  of  existing  systems  is  a  fan-
tastic  idea  and  the  best  possible  use  of  the  money.  It’s  something 
Congress  should  be  spending  a  lot  of  time  and  attention  on,  and 
they  have.  But  a  software  solution  to  tie  together  existing  systems 
doesn’t correct the failings of the system. They can’t boost the per-
formance  of  the  basic  device.  So,  if  somebody  has  a  1980s-tech-
nology  two-way  radio  in  their  hand  when  they  go  into  an  emer-
gency,  all  the  software  interoperability  solutions  in  the  world  can 
only achieve tying them back in. It can’t improve the functionality. 
Our  focus  is  on  improving  the  functionality  and  bringing  data  and 
video-type  services  to  improve  situational  awareness  as  people 
head into dangerous situations which is a very different thing. And, 
of course, yes, it’s more expensive. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  I  mean,  yes,  Mr.  O’Brien,  I  haven’t  reached 
a conclusion about your proposal. But I am saying this, that if the 
SAFECOM program in the Department of Homeland Security is fa-
voring hardware technology that isn’t going to help us on interoper-
ability,  that’s  a  much  cheaper  problem  to  solve  and  allows  us  to 
bootstrap the existing service. I can guarantee you, when you have 
to  think  about  the  Olympic  Peninsula  or  Alaska  or  Hawaii,  and 
they  have  to  think  about  tsunamis  and  things  that  are  happening 
on a day-to-day basis, or could happen, or Mount St. Helens, or Mt. 
Ranier,  you  really  want  to  do  all  that  you  can,  now,  immediately, 
on this issue, until——

Senator STEVENS. Would the Senator yield just for a second? 
Senator CANTWELL. Yes. 
Senator  STEVENS.  The  problem  is,  when  they  get  the  local  gov-
ernments,  the  State  governments,  they  award  it  to  the  lowest  bid-
der.  The  reason  the  military  has  one  is,  there’s  federalization.  Un-
less  you  federalize  it,  the  lowest  bidder  is  still  going  to  buy  it, 
whether—— 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Well,  I’m  happy  to  work  with  the  Senator 
from  Alaska  on  this  issue,  and  figure  out  how  we  can  make  sure 
that  the  hardware  purchases,  going  forward—and,  again,  the— 
probably  one  of  the  lower-cost  elements  of  the  system  can  be  up-
graded to IP solutions. So, I thank the Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Sununu? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN E. SUNUNU, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE 

Senator SUNUNU. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
It’s  a  very  interesting  hearing.  And  I  think  we  can  all  stipulate 
that we’re all for public safety and we’re all for interoperability and 
we’re  all  for  our  local  first  responders.  But  somehow,  like  anyone 
else, I feel a need to make that absolutely clear for the record. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  SUNUNU.  Let  me  begin  just  by  picking  up  on  one  of  the 
points made by Senator Stevens, and that is, one of the overriding 
concerns  of  any  proposal  like  this  is  its  timing  and  the  potential 
delay that it can have on choices and decisions and legislation that 
has  been  implemented  or  passed  after  being  negotiated  over  a  10- 
year  period.  The  potential  costs  of  changes  to  that  path  are  very 
significant. They can be financial. Senator Stevens talked about the 
change  in  the  distribution  methodology  for  these  resources  if  we’re 
not  going  to  have  an  auction,  if  we’re  not  going  to  have  the  same 
anticipated  collection  of  revenues.  It  will  have  real  implications  on 
funding  streams  for  equipment  and  upgrades  and  first-responder 
technology. 

Second is the impact to the market. The competitive implications 
of  making  a  decision  not  to  put  spectrum  in  the  hands  of  the  pri-
vate sector. And that also has public safety implications, real public 
safety 
implications,  because  that  private-sector-controlled/used 
spectrum  is  used  by  both  consumers  and  existing  public  safety  re-
sponders. It’s commercial spectrum—but they use it for public safe-
ty  purposes.  And  anyone  who’s  ever  called  911  can  attest  to  that. 
I  mean,  that  is  part  of  our  public  safety  infrastructure,  but  that 
911 call, most of the time, is being initiated on a commercial spec-
trum being carried by a private sector operator. And a delay in put-
ting  more  spectrum  into  the  hands  of  the  commercial  operators 
does  ultimately  have  an  impact  on  the  quality  of  those  networks 
that have some public safety function. 

Next, we have an existing 24 megahertz of spectrum that we are 
committed to putting in the hands of public safety. That’s good, and 
that’s  important,  and  I  have  supported  legislation  to  put  that  into 
the  hands  of  public  safety  even  faster.  And  there’s  a  little  bit  of 
tension between public safety advocates and the broadcasters about 
getting  that  spectrum  into  the  hands  of  public  safety  faster.  But  I 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:58 Oct 06, 2010 Jkt 039473 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39473.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

think  it’s  a  tough  choice,  but  one  we  should  make  and  one  we 
should continue to push for. But the question is, How can we make 
sure  that  24  megahertz  of  spectrum  is  used  as  effectively  as  pos-
sible?  And  I  think  that’s  an  area  where  we  need  to  focus  much 
more  attention  before  just  making  a  decision  to  throw  even  more 
spectrum  at  the  public  safety  arena.  We  want  to  make  sure  we’re 
using  it  effectively.  I  think  the  FCC  has  done  the  right  thing  in 
putting  out  a  notice  of  proposed  rulemaking,  to  say,  ‘‘Look,  are 
there ways that we can use this 24 megahertz we’ve allocated more 
effectively and more efficiently?’’ 

And  I  want  to  begin  on  that  point,  because  I  think  it  was  Mr. 
McEwen  who,  in  his  testimony,  talked  about  the  proposed  rule-
making  at  the  FCC.  In  your  testimony,  you  argued  that  using  the 
24 megahertz that have been allocated for public safety would take 
away,  from  local  licensing  control,  the  spectrum  long  promised  for 
use  by  local  agencies.  But  it’s  certainly  my  sense,  from  watching 
this debate, that local licensing efforts has really led to a pretty in-
efficient  use  of  some  of  the  spectrum  that’s  out  there.  So,  why 
shouldn’t we expect more efficiency from those public safety opera-
tors,  rather  than  just  casting  more  spectrum  into  their  domain? 
That’s a question for you, Mr. McEwen. 

Mr. MCEWEN. Yes, OK. Well, thank you, Senator. 
First  of  all,  I  want  to  thank  you  and  the  members  of  the  Com-
mittee  that  have  supported  giving  us  the  24—or  making  available 
to  us  the  24  megahertz  of  spectrum.  Let  me  give  you  a  quick  his-
tory. 

First  of  all,  you—you,  the  Senate,  and  the  Congress—directed 
the  FCC,  more  than  10  years  ago,  to  give  us  that  spectrum.  OK? 
So, when you say you’re concerned about that we use it efficiently, 
let  me  tell  you,  we’ve  had  10  years  to  figure  out  how  we’re  going 
to  use  it,  and  we  don’t  have  it  yet.  OK?  And,  like  you  said,  you 
have  supported  giving  that  to  us  as  soon  as  possible.  Right  now, 
the  law  says  2009.  That’s  the  earliest.  So,  we’ve  had  lots  of 
time—— 

Senator SUNUNU. But my—— 
Mr. MCEWEN.—to figure out how to—— 
Senator  SUNUNU.—point  isn’t  the  efficiency  of  spectrum  you 
haven’t received. I’m talking about the efficiency of spectrum that’s 
already in the hands of public safety. 

Mr. MCEWEN. You’re talking about the other spectrum—— 
Senator SUNUNU. Sure—— 
Mr. MCEWEN.—other than the 24. 
Senator  SUNUNU.—spectrum  that’s  being  used  now.  And  I  think 
it’s fair to say that it is not necessarily being used as effective and 
as efficiently as possible. What’s the spectrum that’s in public safe-
ty hands now, 40 megahertz, give or take? 
Mr. MCEWEN. No, it’s 23, other than—— 
Senator SUNUNU. So—— 
Mr. MCEWEN.—the 24. 
Senator SUNUNU. Well, no—— 
Mr. MCEWEN. But the point is—the point is, I would respectfully 
disagree with you. There are lots of people who haven’t had experi-
ence in public safety communications that would say that we don’t 
use that——

51 

Senator SUNUNU. It’s 25 megahertz. 
Mr. MCEWEN.—spectrum—— 
Senator SUNUNU. Twenty-five megahertz. 
Mr.  MCEWEN.  Right.  You  know,  there  are  lots  of  people  that 
would  say  we  don’t  use  that  efficiently.  The  problem  is  that  gen-
erally there are academicians and people who have a reason not to 
think  that  we  ought  to  have  more  spectrum.  I  mean,  I  would  be 
glad  to  have  discussions  with  you  or  anybody  else,  and  I  believe 
that  if  you  were  to  think  about  it  carefully,  from  what  we  would 
tell you, you would find that isn’t necessarily true. 

Senator SUNUNU. And my point isn’t an argument for not making 

more spectrum available. As I have pointed out—— 

Mr. MCEWEN. Right. 
Senator  SUNUNU.—I  have  voted  much  more  aggressively  than 
many  other  members  of  the  U.S.  Senate  to  make  that  available  to 
you sooner. 

Mr. MCEWEN. Yes, you have. 
Senator  SUNUNU.  The  real  question,  though,  is,  What  can  we  do 
to  ensure  an  improvement  in  the  efficiency,  both  of  the  spectrum, 
the 25 megahertz public safety currently has access to, and the 24 
that’s going to be allocated? 
Mr. MCEWEN. Let me—— 
Senator  SUNUNU.  And  my  point  is,  those  are  questions  that  are 
probably  more  important  to  address,  soon  and  effectively,  than  de-
ciding whether to make another 30 megahertz available. 

My time is limited, so—I apologize. I know a couple of you want-
ed  to  comment  on  that,  but  I’d  like  to  move  to  another  area  that 
I think is very important. 

Senator  Cantwell  spoke  very  effectively  about  the  importance  of 
looking  at  existing  technology,  IP  technology,  in  particular.  Mr. 
Billstrom,  I  enjoyed  your  testimony.  And  Senator  Cantwell  and  I 
have  worked  to  try  to  make  sure  that,  of  the  billion  dollars  that’s 
being  allocated  as  a  part  of  this—funds  that  will  come  from  the 
auction  of  spectrum  can  be  used,  but  doesn’t  have  to  be  used  for 
implementation of IP communications solutions. And the only issue 
I  have  with  Senator  Cantwell’s  remarks  is,  she  talked  about  this 
as  a  bootstrap  operation,  and  I  think  that  can  have  very  positive 
connotations,  but,  at  the  same  time,  we’ve  got  to  recognize  that 
these IP networks are incredibly robust. We cannot shy away from 
that.  And  they’re  only  going  to  improve  over  time.  And  we  saw 
what a positive impact they had in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. 
And, Mr. Billstrom, you obviously have much more firsthand expe-
rience than I or anyone on this committee. So, I would like to hear 
from you a little bit as to whether you think it’s a good idea to use 
some  of  that  billion  for  a  purchase  of  IP  technologies  and  to  what 
extent you think that those IP systems are useful and will be use-
ful for more rural areas, because, you know, they don’t always have 
access to some of the backbone that makes these systems work. 

Mr.  BILLSTROM.  That’s  right.  Both  the  military,  overseas,  but 
also  the  National  Guard,  domestically,  are  using  IP  Radio  tech-
nology  to  provide  connectivity  into  areas  that  have  absolutely  no 
infrastructure at all. So, that’s a good model for rural communities 
that  don’t  yet  have  Internet  broadband  access.  Technology  such  as 
satellites,  point-to-point  digital  microwave,  many  of  the  pieces  of

the  puzzle  that  are  used  by  the  cellular  industry  can  also  be  used 
here,  which  is—one  of  the  things  I  didn’t  speak  about  in  my  testi-
mony, is that almost all, if not all, of the hardware used in IP net-
works is the same hardware that is used in this building, for this— 
for  the  computers  in  this  building  and  the  computers  in  the  mili-
tary. We can use off-the-shelf commercially available equipment for 
that,  which  lowers  the  cost  and  separates  the  software  from  the 
hardware, which gives us much more flexibility as time goes on. 

We’ve  already  seen  the  cost  of  satellite  units  drop  by  at  least  a 
factor of 200 percent in the last 3 years. Others can comment more 
specifically to that. So, there are plenty of opportunities there. 

There’s another area that sometimes come up, which is a concern 
about  security.  I  am  not  an  encryption  expert,  but  the  DOD  that’s 
deployed  IP  Radio  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan  presumably  have  ad-
dressed this issue. 

Senator SUNUNU. Let me close, Mr. O’Brien, by returning to you 
on  this  point,  because  I  think  you  said  something  that  was  a  little 
bit  misleading  in  reference  to  the  work  that’s  being  done  in  this 
space.  You  talked  about  the  first  responder,  with  a  1980s  radio, 
that  somehow,  an  IP  system  isn’t  going  to  help  the  first  responder 
with  a  1980s  radio.  But  neither  is  what  you’re  proposing.  And  I 
want to do something about the person with the 1980s technology, 
but setting up a system that has video capability or data capability, 
which  isn’t  going  to  make  any  difference  to  the  person  with  the 
1980s radio technology if it’s not compatible with the network that 
you’re  building.  So,  there’s  going  to  be  an  issue  with  compatibility 
and  equipment  upgrades  in  order  to  take  advantage  of  modern  IP 
networks that might have video or data capability, but that’s going 
to  exist,  regardless,  for  all  of  those  first  responders  that  rely  on 
equipment that’s analog or outdated or in need of an upgrade. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator McCaskill? 

STATEMENT OF HON. CLAIRE MCCASKILL, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI 

Senator MCCASKILL. First, I want to thank the panel, and I par-
ticularly  want  to  thank  the  representatives  from  the  Chiefs  of  Po-
lice  and  the  Chiefs  of  Fire  Departments.  I’m  a  former  prosecutor, 
and as a very young prosecutor, because my father was a volunteer 
firefighter,  I  asked  to  take  over  the  arson  specialty.  And  so,  Steve 
Westerman  is  here,  who  is  the  Fire  Chief  from  Eastern  Jackson 
County Fire Protection District, which was in my area where I was 
the  arson  prosecutor.  And  30  years  ago,  I  was  trying  to  explain  to 
his  folks  how  important  it  was  not  to  break  down  that  door  until 
they  checked  to  see  if  it  was  locked,  because  it  was  kind  of  hard 
to make those circumstantial arson cases if we didn’t know wheth-
er  the  door  was  locked  or  not  before  they  broke  it  down  fighting 
the fire. 

It’s  very  difficult  for  me  to  question  any  testimony  coming  from 
your  two  organizations  because  of  my  background.  I  want  to  con-
gratulate  the  City  of  Kansas  City,  and  particularly  Chief  Smokey 
Dyer,  on  an  incredible  response  to  a  chemical  explosion  that  we 
had  in  Kansas  City  yesterday,  a  major  chemical  explosion,  very 
near downtown Kansas City, 18,000 gallons of foam were used yes-

terday  afternoon.  We’re  talking  about  a  major  evacuation  in  a 
major metropolitan area, and we had no injuries. It was a remark-
able showing of skill by our Emergency Operations Center in Kan-
sas  City,  and  I  didn’t  want  to  get  to  my  questions  before  I  con-
gratulated Chief Dyer, my old friend Smokey, and all of the profes-
sional first responders in Kansas City for that incredible job. 

I  want  to  ask  Mr.  O’Brien—I’m  assuming  this  proposal  is  predi-

cated on the idea that it will make a profit. 

Mr.  O’BRIEN.  Actually—sorry,  Senator—let  me  divide  it  into  two 
pieces.  A  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust,  which  plays  the  major 
role in this operation, would be not-for-profit. The commercial part-
ners  that  would  come  in  to  a  relationship  with  the  Public  Safety 
Broadband  Trust  and  build  out  to  the  specifications  of  the  Public 
Safety  Broadband  Trust  would  be  expecting  to  make  a  return  on 
their  investment.  That’s  the  fuel  that  keeps  this  whole  thing  run-
ning. 

Cyren,  or  whoever  is  selected  to  be  the  manager,  would  expect 
to  have  a  negotiated  arrangement  with  the  Public  Safety 
Broadband Trust to get a return on investment also. So—— 

Senator MCCASKILL. Well—— 
Mr. O’BRIEN.—hopefully I’ve got that—— 
Senator MCCASKILL. Right. I think that was a long way of saying 
that  this  proposal  will  produce  a  profit,  correct?  I  mean,  you  have 
great experience in this field, in terms of putting together a private 
enterprise effort that eventually became one of the largest and very 
successful wireless providers in this country. 

Mr. O’BRIEN. Right. 
Senator  MCCASKILL.  I’m  assuming  you’ve  gone  into  this  with  a 
business  model  that  will  provide  bottom-line  positive  activity,  in 
terms of profit. 

Mr.  O’BRIEN.  Right.  And,  even  more  importantly,  I  think,  is  to 
use that to fund the buildout of a next-generation public safety sys-
tem.  It’s  a  teaming  up  of  the  public  interest  with  a  private—a  se-
ries of private—partners. If you don’t have an opportunity for those 
commercial  operators  to  make  a  return  on  their  investment  on 
building out the network, well, then, of course, as you understand, 
they won’t build out the network. 

Our  role,  my  role,  is  far  more  to  just  tee  up  this  debate  than  it 
is to duplicate or replicate what I’m very proud of, which is the suc-
cess  of  Nextel.  I  mean,  Nextel  was  a  very  different  opportunity,  a 
very different business in a different time. But, yes, we set out for 
the  shareholders  of  Nextel  to  try  to  take  spectrum,  use  spectrum 
more efficiently, and generate value out of that proposition. And we 
were successful, as you say. 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  I  guess  my  question  is,  if,  ultimately,  this 
entire  proposal  will  be—will  provide  that,  ‘‘return  on  investment,’’ 
or,  you  know,  to  put  it  bluntly,  ‘‘profit,’’  why  not  just  bid  on  the 
spectrum when it comes up at auction? 

Mr. LARGENT. Could I answer your question, Senator? 
Senator MCCASKILL. Sure. 
Mr. LARGENT. I think the—your question is the question that our 
commercial  providers  are  asking  themselves.  Why  would  they  pay 
to  build  a  premium  system  that  public  safety  needs  and  then  pay 
a  premium  to  the  person  that—the  in-between  person,  between

public  safety  and  them,  to  build  out  the  system?  And  then  they’ve 
got  to  pay  to  build  the  system,  itself.  So,  there’s  a  lot  of  cost  that 
goes into building this system, and a premium that would go to the 
interloper,  if  you  will,  between  public  safety  and  the  commercial 
folks  that  would  use  it.  And  I  just  don’t  think—I  think  this  indus-
try  is  so  competitive  that  the  cost  of  building  that  system—that 
there  would  be  no  return  from  the  investment.  And  so,  that’s  why 
I really think there are some questions about the model that’s con-
structed here, that there would be a healthy return. And—— 

Senator MCCASKILL. But—— 
Mr. LARGENT.—there’s a lot of skepticism about that. 
Senator MCCASKILL. But let me ask a question. I’m——I want to 
make  sure  I  understand  this.  Am  I  correct  that  this  proposal  as-
sumes  that  commercial  providers  will  build  out  the  network  when 
it  comes  to  a  small  community  like  Lebanon,  Missouri,  as  opposed 
to Kansas City and St. Louis? Well, what happens if those commer-
cial providers don’t step up and build that out? Aren’t we still going 
to be looked to, to provide that important capability for rural Amer-
ica and rural Missouri? 

Mr. MCEWEN. Can I answer—— 
Senator MCCASKILL. Sure. 
Mr.  MCEWEN.—that,  Senator?  Let  me  give  you  a  little  different 
perspective from a public safety perspective, not a Morgan O’Brien 
perspective or a CTIA perspective. We look at this differently than 
was  just  described  by  Mr.  Largent.  We  look  at  it  that  we’re  going 
to—this spectrum is not going to be Mr. O’Brien’s spectrum, it’s not 
going to be the commercial—they’re not going to own this. This will 
be managed—it’ll be in a trust that public safety will manage. OK? 
He  described  the  business  model.  I  don’t  want  to  get  into  that,  be-
cause  that’s  not  my  area.  But  the  fact  is  that  you  do  have  to  have 
investors  who  will  make  a  profit,  who  will  build  out  the  network, 
or we would have to then ask the Congress again to fund more and 
more and more. So, that business model is there. 

But  the  difference  is  that  this  spectrum  would  be  managed  by 
public safety, not by the commercial interests, and it would be our 
interest  to  build  out—for  instance,  in  answer  to  your  question,  in 
these rural areas—the commercial companies that now are in exist-
ence don’t have a commercial need. They can’t find it profitable for 
them  to  build  out  in  some  of  those  areas.  It  isn’t  viable  for  them. 
However,  we  need  it.  We  need  that  service  in  those  rural  areas, 
and the public needs it. This would pay for that extension. 

I  envision  taking  one  of  the  commercial,  or  more  of  the  commer-
cial, providers that are in existence today, take a Verizon, a Sprint/ 
Nextel,  a  T-Mobile,  either  a  combination  of  them  or  one  of  them— 
actually, we would be looking to take their nationwide network and 
improve  it,  build  it  out,  harden  it.  We  would  invest  in  it.  We 
wouldn’t have to build a whole new network. The concept here, you 
know,  is  pretty  simple.  From  our  perspective,  it’s  a  little  different. 
The  problem  is  that  right  now  the  industry—Verizon  and  others— 
don’t want to talk with us about that, because they want the spec-
trum  for  their  own  commercial  purposes.  If  the  spectrum  is  allo-
cated  for  public  safety,  we  would  then  be  trying  to  negotiate  with 
the  commercial  providers  to  either—as  one  of  them,  for  a  nation-
wide network, or having regional parts of it, to build this out.

auction. 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  So,  you’d  be  doing  your  kind  of  own  mini- 

Mr.  MCEWEN.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And  we  would  be  building 
it  to  our  needs,  hardening  the  network,  which  the  commercial  in-
terests  haven’t  done  a  good  job  of,  making  it  more  reliable,  more 
redundant.  It  would  serve  our  interests,  which  are  different  than 
theirs,  and  would  serve  the  public’s  interest  much  better  than  it 
does today. 

Senator MCCASKILL. It’s just—you know, and I—I’m out of time, 
but  I  do—it’s  a  hard  concept  for  me  to  get  my  arms  around,  that 
we will take something that is—could be auctioned on a—in a pub-
lic sale and then have those resources available to do what we need 
to  do  to  help  first  responders.  As  a  government  function,  that  we 
would, in fact, embrace a hybrid, which is a profit-making venture, 
to  someone  who  hasn’t  had  to  compete  to  get  that,  that’s  difficult 
for me. 

I thank you all very much. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Snowe? 

STATEMENT OF HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE 

Senator SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Obviously,  it’s  a  dual  challenge,  in  terms  of—I  mean,  it’s  abso-
lutely vital that we have, you know, our first responders having the 
kind  of  equipment  and  the  ability  to  communicate.  Having  been 
down to visit during—in the aftermath of the disaster of Hurricane 
Katrina,  and  watching  the  Coast  Guard,  for  example,  they  didn’t 
have  interoperability  in  the  communications,  but  they—you  know, 
they’re  a  can-do  operation,  they  were  able  to  overcome  that.  And 
so,  it’s  no  question  that,  with  our—you  know,  our  policemen  and 
the  firefighters,  they  need  to  have  the  capacity  to  do  that.  But  the 
question  is,  How  do  we  achieve  these  dual  goals?  And,  you  know, 
for  the  last  10,  20  years,  where  we  think—we  view  the  spectrum 
as  a  public  entity.  So,  this  is  unusual.  It’s  a  precedent,  from  the 
standpoint  of  transferring  to  a  private-sector  entity,  in  addition  to 
the  potential  for  the  loss  of  revenues  by  virtue  of  doing  it  in  this 
instance,  in  the  manner  in  which  you  are  recommending,  Mr. 
O’Brien. 

How—I  want  to  ask  Mr.  Werner  and  Mr.  McEwen,  with  respect 
to  the  24  megahertz—because  currently  it’s  for  radio.  If  the  FCC 
changes  the  rule  to  include  that  use  for  broadband,  could  that  be 
accomplished? 

Mr.  MCEWEN.  Yes.  Right  now,  the  24  megahertz—as  I  said, 
we’ve  had  10  years  to  figure  out  how  we’re  going  to  use  this,  and 
we  don’t  have  it  yet,  so  we’ve  got  lots  of  time  to  do  that.  The  24 
megahertz  right  now,  under  current  rules,  is  segmented  into  two 
12-megahertz  blocks.  Twelve  megahertz  of  that  is  designated  for 
mission-critical  voice.  That  is  mission-critical  to  the  major  metro-
politan  areas  of  this  country.  The  big  cities,  like  New  York,  Chi-
cago,  Miami,  they  have  no  more  voice  spectrum;  they  need  it  des-
perately.  So,  that  was  something  that  we  asked  the  Congress  to 
give  us  years  and  years  ago,  and  we  would  hate  to  have  you  take 
that  away  from  us.  That’s  in—that’s  pretty  sacrosanct,  from  our 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:58 Oct 06, 2010 Jkt 039473 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39473.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

56 

perspective.  The  other  12  megahertz  was  intended  for  data.  Origi-
nally, when we put the recommendations to the FCC for the rules, 
it was to be wideband data, because nobody had heard much about 
broadband  data.  Today,  we  have  recommended  to  the  FCC  that 
they change the rules to allow that to be used for either broadband 
or  wideband,  and  it  would  be  chosen  by  the  local  regions  in  your 
area  of  the  State.  So,  that  is  intended  to  be  done  that  way.  That 
isn’t a different problem. 

The  problem  here  is  taking  that  12  megahertz  and  trying  to 
build  a  nationwide  network.  As  far  as  we  can  understand,  there 
isn’t enough spectrum there to attract the kind of investors to build 
this without having to, again, come back to you to fund it. 

Senator  SNOWE.  I  see.  So,  you’re  saying  that  is  the  only  way  to 
have  an  interoperable  deployment  of  broadband  to  all  areas  of  the 
country. 

Mr. MCEWEN. That’s right. It would be a—— 
Senator  SNOWE.  So,  it  is  not  possible,  under  the  24  megahertz, 

with the 12 that you’re saying would be set aside? 

Mr.  MCEWEN.  That’s  our  opinion.  I  mean,  we  believe  that  that 
isn’t  sufficient,  number  one,  to  serve  the  needs  of  both  commercial 
and  private/public  safety.  Without  the  investment,  we  have  no 
money  to  build  a  nationwide  network,  Senator.  And  that’s  the  big 
problem here, is that the commercial people don’t offer us any com-
mercial—any  kind  of  a  model  that  would  pay  for  this,  other  than 
to  come  back  to  you,  sitting  here  today,  to  continue  to  fund  that. 
I mean, this is a great way to take it off the backs of the taxpayer. 

Senator SNOWE. Mr. Werner? 
Mr.  WERNER.  Just  add  to  that.  The  other  problem  that  we  run 
into with the current system is that we are forced to stovepipe our 
systems  based  on  the  current  model.  The  Public  Safety  Broadband 
Trust would allow, at much larger economy of scale—which means 
we, as first responders, would now be able to buy devices on a com-
mon network that’s commercial, and be able to see the evolution of 
the  new  technology  that  we  are  constantly  behind.  Without  that 
economy  of  scale,  even  if  we  were  able  to  take  the  12  megahertz 
and make it a nationwide network, we still would not have the vol-
ume to create the opportunities to buy radios at what we think are 
affordable  and  reasonable  prices,  which  we  are  very  much  having 
difficulty now. 

And just—along with that same with the network, when you talk 
about  the  IP  Radios,  I  don’t  think  any  of  us  here  have  any  argu-
ment  that  IP  Radios  are  in  our  future.  The  difference  that—the 
really big difference here that you see, that this network offers, is, 
we  don’t  have  the  network  in  place  that  the  military  has  in  place, 
which  is  very  expensive.  If  we  did  have  such  a  network  of  700 
megahertz  that  strengthened—the  IP  Radios  suddenly  become  a 
much more viable solution for us to use on an everyday basis. And 
we see the partnerships. 

And with the satellite, the proposal that Cyren Call has written, 
that we are looking at as Public Safety Broadband Trust, also em-
braces satellite technology that says we realize that it can’t be ter-
restrial  all  the  time,  because  of  the  failures  and  the  redundancy. 
So, I think that what this does is, it creates an opportunity that 
is  self-sustaining  on  a  commercial  market,  that  has  the  volume  of 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:58 Oct 06, 2010 Jkt 039473 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39473.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

57 

scale  that  continues  the  ability  to  evolve  new  technology,  as  op-
posed  to  us  buying  radios  that  are  obsolete  as  soon  as  we  buy 
them. 

Senator  SNOWE.  Mr.  Largent,  how  do  you  respond  to  that?  Be-
cause  I  think  it  is  the  question,  What  is  the  guarantee  that  if  we 
go  through  the  traditional  route  that  you  are  going  to  extend  this 
network  to  rural  areas?  As  I  understand,  under  Mr.  O’Brien’s  pro-
posal,  we  are  talking  about  covering  99  percent  of  our  population 
within  the  next  decade.  It  is  a  concern,  for  those  of  us  who  rep-
resent rural areas, as to whether or not we’re ever going to get this 
service.  What  would  the  wireless  industry  do  to  guarantee 
braodband deployment and public safety services in rural areas? 

Mr.  LARGENT.  Well,  Senator,  I’m  not  sure  you  were  here  for  my 
opening  statement,  but  I  mentioned  there  that  we  are  conducting 
a seminar—not a seminar, but a—putting our heads together with 
the public safety community to try to figure out, What are the best 
ways  that  we  can  put  this  puzzle  together?  And  it’ll  be  the  first 
time  that  we’ve  ever  done  that.  We’re  going  to  conduct  that  in— 
I  think  it’s  in  April—April  9th—the  week  of  April  9th.  And  we’ll 
conduct that kind of discussion. 

But  the  important  thing  is,  is  that  Congress  has  acted.  They’ve 
delivered  24  megahertz  in  the  700-megahertz  spectrum,  for  public 
safety. We still think that there’s a possibility to use the 12 mega-
hertz  to  deliver  a  broadband  service  for  public  safety  in  the  space 
that  you’ve  given  them  already.  We  don’t  need  to  go  back  and  re-
work it. 

Senator SNOWE. In all parts of the country? 
Mr. LARGENT. In all parts of the country—— 
Senator SNOWE. In all—— 
Mr. LARGENT.—that’s right. 
Senator SNOWE. In all? 
Mr. LARGENT. Absolutely. 
Senator SNOWE. They obviously disagree on that question. 
Mr. O’BRIEN. Yes. Senator, may I just take 1 minute? 
Senator SNOWE. Yes. 
Mr.  O’BRIEN.  It’s  a  critical  imperative  to  get  the  benefits  of 
broadband  into  rural  America.  We  see  only  one  way.  I  don’t  think 
a seminar conducted by CTIA is going to reverse 25 years of ignor-
ing  rural  America  by  wireless.  And  it’s  not  because  commercial 
wireless  is  heartless,  it’s  because  they  are  driven  by  the  necessity 
to earn a return on the investment they make. 

The  beauty  of—the  reason  we’re  so  anxious  to  have  you  take  a 
close look at—this proposal is that it will bring broadband to rural 
areas,  because  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  will  be  able  to 
take a national view of meeting certain objectives. And the primary 
objective—our  suggestion—is  that  the  Public  Safety  Broadband 
Trust  should  extend  coverage  to  rural  America,  where  it  has  not 
been,  and  to  have  it  paid  for  by  the  overall  economics  of  a  nation-
wide system. This is new. This is disruptive. 

This is, with all due respect, not going to be solved at a seminar 
run  by  Dale  Hatfield  or  Albert  Einstein.  It’s  about  the  money. 
Where  do  you  find  the  money?  If  this  Congress  and  the  State  and 
local  jurisdictions  are  willing  to  fund  billions  of  dollars  a  year  of 
losses  in  rural  America,  then  that  solves  the  problem.  But  I  don’t

believe they are. Twelve megahertz of spectrum won’t support a so-
lution  such  as  ours.  It’s  math,  not  politics.  It’s  math.  You  need  to 
have sufficient critical mass of spectrum to attract the investment, 
to solve this problem, and to bring broadband to rural America. 

We  urge  the  members  of  this  committee  to  consider  this.  It  is 
complex.  It  is  complex.  But  take  into  consideration  that  virtually 
every  public  safety  organization  that  has  looked  at  this—virtually 
every  one—is  supporting  this.  This  is  a  crying-out-for-help  signal. 
We  are  sending  men  and  women  into  dangerous  situations  every 
day,  knowing  that  their  devices  are  inferior.  How  can  we,  as  a 
country, continue to do that? We have a solution. I understand that 
the legislation was put on the books a year ago. That can’t possibly 
mean that the legislation can’t be improved by this committee and 
this Congress. It can’t mean that.

I think this is the second or third hearing I’ve attended as a new

I—in  my  old  job,  as  Governor,  I—we  actually,  in  Delaware,  put 
in  place  an  800-megahertz  system,  started  doing  it  about—almost 
10  years  ago.  We  came  into  some  money  and  decided  to  spend  it 
on  other  things,  put  in  a  system  that  would  allow  our  police  and 
fire and paramedics and National Guard and other first responders 
to  communicate.  Took  a  while  to  perfect  the  system,  and  we  had 
problems  with  the  remote  parts  of  our  State,  the  parts  that  stick 
out into the ocean, and we had problems communicating with first 
responders  when  they  were  in  buildings—big  buildings.  But  we  fi-
nally  worked  it  out,  put  a  lot  of  repeaters  in  on  these  towers,  and 
finally  got  a  pretty  good  system.  The  folks  from  Motorola  were 
good.  They  didn’t  give  up,  and  we  wouldn’t  let  them  give  up.  And 
we  put  some  money  of  our  own,  and  took  a  little  bit  of  Federal 
money, too, to pump in, to make it work. So, that’s, sort of like, the 
perspective that I bring to this argument. 

And I say that as a preface to a question I’m really going to ask 
you  all,  and  give  you  about  a  minute  to  respond  to  this  question, 
if  you  will.  I  missed  your  opening  statements.  I’d  be  lying  if  I  said 
I’m going to go home and read them. And—— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  CARPER.  maybe  I  should.  Others  will  tell  you  they’re 

going to home and read them. I’ll tell you the truth—I’m not. 

What—that’s  why  I  hire  these  smart  staff  people—what  I  would 
like  to  ask  each  of  you—just  a  minute  apiece—give  me  a  1-minute 
takeaway, just, kind of, tell me, out of your testimonies—it’s impos-
sible for me to remember everything you’re going to say, but maybe

a 1-minute takeaway from each of you for a guy who’s a recovering 
Governor. 

Mr.  WERNER.  OK.  We  need  new  technology.  You,  going  through 
the  experience  of  800-megahertz  radio  system,  know  how  difficult 
and  complex  that  is,  and  you  know  that  once  you  put  all  that 
money  into  it,  that  it  is  what  it  is;  it  doesn’t  change,  it  doesn’t 
evolve.  In  10  years,  you’ll  be  forced  to  replace  that  infrastructure 
that  you  have  in  place,  which  will  be  millions  and  millions  of  dol-
lars. And just that example of New York City that Mr. Largent ref-
erenced earlier, their system, for New York City alone, is $500 mil-
lion—funded  by  the  Federal  Government,  by  the  way.  Now,  if 
you’re  going  to  give  Charlottesville,  Virginia,  that  umpteen  million 
dollars,  or  the  State  of  Virginia,  I  don’t  really  have  any  more  dis-
cussion  with  you.  I’m  OK  with  that.  I  don’t  think  that’s  going  to 
happen. 

The  other  thing  is,  we’re  continually—the  way  the—the  way  it’s 
set  up  now,  it’s  forced  to  stovepipe  the  current  systems,  not  to 
make them system-of-systems or a nationwide network. And, again, 
we’re  faced  with  the  expensive  nature  of  the  radios,  because  of  a 
limited  competition  for  public  safety,  because  of  the  economy  of 
scale. Change the network, make it available to everybody, increase 
the  technology,  it  evolves,  it’s  self-sustaining.  It  looks  to  me  like  it 
makes perfect sense. 

Senator CARPER. All right. Thanks, Mr. Werner. 
Mr. McEwen, give me your best 1-minute. 
Mr. MCEWEN. I’ll give you a quick 1-minute. 
You  talked  about  the  new  800—or  the  800-megahertz  system  in 
Delaware.  That’s  a  voice  system,  mission-critical  voice  system.  It’s 
very  good.  It’s  getting  better  all  the  time.  I  know  the  people  that 
run it in Delaware, so I’m familiar with it. 

This  is  a  data  system  with  voice  capability.  People  are  talking 
about  Internet  protocol,  Voice-over-IP.  You  have  that  capability  in 
a broadband network, but it’s primarily to bring us new capabilities 
in  a  broadband  way  and  have  interoperability  and  roaming 
throughout  the  whole  country.  It’s  a  big  difference.  It’s  a  revolu-
tionary  change.  We  will  never  have  the  money—there’s  no  money 
that  I  know  of,  in  this  Congress  or  any  other  place,  to  build  this 
kind  of  a  network  and  to  have  a  nationwide  opportunity  like  this. 
And  I  will  tell  you,  if  you  talk  to  your  people  back  in  Delaware, 
they will tell you they think this is the right thing to do. 

Senator CARPER. All right, thank you. 
Mr. O’Brien, 1 minute, please. 
Mr. O’BRIEN. Yes, Senator, and thank you. 
‘‘Nearly miraculous’’ is the way I describe wireless services today 
and  on  the  near  horizon—nearly  miraculous  and  transformational. 
It’s  hard  to  exaggerate  what  they  have  done  and  will  do.  Our  plea 
is to figure out a way, which can only happen here, it can only hap-
pen in this committee—figure out a way to make those capabilities 
available  to  the  men  and  women  who  never  calculate  the  reward, 
but  always  are  willing  to  take  any  risk  to  try  to  save  life  or  prop-
erty. Give them those devices. 

Senator  CARPER.  I  think  the  last  time  I  heard  someone  use  the 
term  ‘‘nearly  miraculous,’’  they  were  describing  my  election  to  the 
U.S. Senate.

[Laughter.] 
Senator CARPER. Miracles do happen. 
Mr. Largent? 
Mr.  LARGENT.  Senator,  I  would  just  say  that  we  applaud  Con-
gress  for  passage  of  the  DTV  Transition  Act  that  designated  24 
megahertz to public safety, a billion dollars to begin the investment 
in  their  system.  We  don’t  think  that  that’ll  be  the  last  money  that 
they’ll  need;  they’ll  certainly  need  more.  But  it’s  a  good  start.  And 
I would just say that we need to keep that course on this particular 
spectrum. 

The  debate  that  they  raise  is  a  worthy  debate  that  needs  to  be 
aired  out  in  Congress,  it  needs  to  be  talked  about  among  the  ex-
perts  in  the  field.  And  we’re  proposing  to  do  that,  in  April,  as  I 
mentioned.  But  our  message  to  you  is  really  that  we  need  to  keep 
this  ship  going  in  the  same  direction  on  the  700  megahertz,  and 
get  that  auction  to  occur  so  that  they  can  begin  building  out  their 
24  megahertz  for  public  safety  and  that  the  commercial  sector  can 
begin building out its 60 megahertz. 

Senator CARPER. Thanks. 
Mr. Billstrom? 
Mr.  BILLSTROM.  Senator,  I’ve  never  done  anything  in  1  minute, 

so—— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator CARPER. Well, give it a shot. 
Mr. BILLSTROM.—I’m going to give it a shot. 
The—what,  mostly,  has  been  discussed  today  is  really  what  I 
would call operability. And what I testified on today was interoper-
ability.  And  my  focus  is  fairly  pragmatic,  and  it’s  also  immediate. 
So, there are the systems like the one in your home State that are 
800 megahertz, and closed. We can’t take a radio from another city 
and  use  it  in  Delaware.  Not  right  now.  And  we  have  rural  areas 
that have 1980s—in fact, some have 1970s-technology radios. 

We’re  suggesting  IP  Radio  is  a  solution  for  connecting  all  those 

together for interoperability. It’s not necessarily for operability. 

Senator CARPER. Thank you. 
The last word. 
Mr.  DESCH.  And  last,  but  not  least,  the  poor  satellite  guy  here, 
who’s  got  a  slightly  different  approach  here,  in  that—not  in  the 
middle of this debate about what’s interoperability or the best way 
to  allocate  spectrum,  which  is  an  interesting  discussion,  but  still 
represent  that  the  systems,  even  the  current  system,  after  25 
years, only, still, is built out to over 65 percent of our country. The 
key  message  that  came  out  of  Katrina  and  Rita  wasn’t  interoper-
ability. It—that was a big issue—but was the fact that the systems 
didn’t work for hundreds of miles and there wasn’t any other solu-
tion. 

So,  we  represent  just  the  opinion  here  that  S.  385,  which  you’re 
supporting,  is  a  great  first  step  to  redundancy,  which  is  an  impor-
tant  thing.  Don’t  forget  that  there  are  other  solutions  that  fit  to-
gether,  interoperate—RoIP  is  a  great  solution,  and  we  use  it,  and 
make the systems work—but, in these systems, don’t forget the sat-
ellite component. 

Senator CARPER. Good. 
Mr. DESCH. Thank you.

Senator  CARPER.  Thank  you  all  very  much,  that  was  helpful. 

Thank you. 

Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Thune? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA 

Senator THUNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hear-
ing.  Thank  you,  to  our  panel.  Thank  you,  to  the  first  responders 
and the members of your organization, for the great work that you 
do out there. 

I’m,  as  is  Senator  Carper,  new  to  this  Committee,  so  it’s  a  steep 
learning  curve,  and  I  appreciate  it  when  you  use  small  words  and 
big print. As my tech-savvy teenage daughters always refer to it as 
‘‘back  in  the  day.’’  I  don’t  remember  the  crystal-set  era,  but  I  do 
remember  a  time  when  we  didn’t  have  near  the  options  in  tech-
nology  available  to  us,  even  in  a  state  like  South  Dakota.  And  I 
grew up in a small town of 600 people, where, at the time, we had 
one  TV  station  and  none  of  the  things  that  we’re  talking  about,  in 
terms of the avenues to the world that our kids have today. 

That’s  why  I  want  to  hone  in  a  little  bit  on  some  of  the  points 
that  have  been  discussed  earlier  with  regard  to  the  impact  of  this 
proposal and other approaches to reaching rural areas. 

In  South  Dakota,  the  State  Department  of  Homeland  Security 
tells  us  that  we  have  90-percent  interoperability  with  regard  to 
voice.  The  next  step,  obviously,  is  broadband.  And  I  also  want  to 
know,  as  I’ve  listened  to  the  discussion  back  and  forth,  what  will 
best  accomplish  the  objective  of  providing  that  sort  of  broadband 
interoperability for our first-responder community in South Dakota. 
And  so,  as  you  have  batted  that  back  and  forth  here,  I  find  that 
to be of great interest and want to continue to hear from you about 
any  additional  light  that  you  can  shed  on  that  particular  subject. 
Mr. O’Brien, I do have a question—a couple of questions that are 
maybe  more  of  a  practical  variety  regarding  the  Cyren  Call  plan. 
One  has  to  do  with  whether  or  not  public  safety  communications 
would be prioritized over typical private customers’ communication. 
The  way  I  understand  it,  that  would  mean  a  call  between  a  fire-
fighter  and  their  headquarters  would  be  prioritized  over  a  call  be-
tween  teenage  sweethearts,  for  example.  And  I  guess  my  question 
is, Would that technology be reliable? And has it been tested exten-
sively? 

Mr.  O’BRIEN.  Senator,  let’s  talk  about  a  couple  of  different 
things.  A  network—a  fourth-generation  wireless  network  such  as 
we  propose—has  three  major  functionalities.  One  is  voice,  one  is 
data, and the other is video. For purposes of focusing on your ques-
tion,  we  are  proposing  that  mission-critical  voice—and  it  doesn’t 
sound,  from  your  hypothetical,  like  you  are  referring  to  mission- 
critical voice—would continue to be carried on existing technologies 
until  such  time  as  public  safety  determines  that  Voice-over-Inter-
net  Protocol  has  achieved  a  level  of  robustness  that  they  want  to 
move  to  it.  I  personally  predict  that  will  not  be  so  very  far  down 
the  road  because  I  have  confidence  in  where  technology  is  going. 
But, I make an important distinction between mission-critical voice

and  data  and  video  capabilities,  which  are  otherwise  not  possible 
on traditional land mobile systems. These advanced data and video 
capabilities  would  never  be  possible  on  traditional  systems  in  a 
rural State such as yours. 

I  do  want  to  focus  attention  on—particularly  for  rural  States— 
the benefits of creating a Public Safety Broadband Trust and allow-
ing that trust to take a national point of view about broadband de-
ployment. For the first time ever, this will be a not-for-profit driven 
perspective to look at coverage—extensive coverage—as its first de-
sign  criteria  and  will  solve—it’s  the  only  model  I’ve  seen  that  has 
any  chance  of  solving—the  25-year-old  problem  that  commercial 
wireless  cannot  deploy  in  areas  where  they  cannot  earn  a  return 
on  those  facilities.  That’s  the  rural  dilemma.  We’re  trying  to  ad-
dress it. 

Senator  THUNE.  Second  question,  a  follow-up  to  that,  would  a 
customer  choose  a  communications  provider  where  a  connection 
could be preempted at any time by a public safety need? 

Mr.  O’BRIEN.  If  we  are  fortunate  enough  to  see  our  vision  come 
true,  that  will  be  one  of  the  most  interesting  parts  of  the  market-
place  test  of  this  kind  of  a  concept.  When  you  think  about  the 
functionalities—the features and functionalities—of the network we 
are  proposing,  built  to  public  safety  grade,  we  believe  there  are 
large numbers of commercial customers that will value those capa-
bilities just like the police value them. We believe that commercial 
customers  will  go  on  that  system  knowing  that,  based  on  certain 
well-articulated  protocols,  under  certain  circumstances  public  safe-
ty will have priority. Think about it in terms of when you’re driving 
down the highway and a siren goes off behind you. You move over 
to  make  way  for  a  higher-priority  use.  We  believe  that  same  con-
cept  is  well  within  the  potential  of  having  a  marketplace  success. 
Mr.  LARGENT.  Senator,  if  I  could  respond  to  your  question,  I 
think  your  question  is  a  good  one.  And  the  commercial  operators 
that  are  members  of  our  association  are  asking  themselves  the 
same question, How do we get return on our capital when we’re co-
erced,  forced,  to  build  towers  in  rural  South  Dakota,  where  there’s 
no return on our investment? Are they going to—is this trust fund 
going to force us to build towers there because we build out in New 
York, and we’ll just take the offset—the capital from New York and 
put  it  in  South  Dakota?  And  I  just  don’t  see  that  that’s  realistic, 
that—you’ll  end  up  with  the  same  problem  that  existed  5  or  10 
years  ago  with  our  industry,  where  we  were  building  out  in  the 
major  metropolitan  areas,  but  not  in  rural  America.  But  now,  as 
you know, we’re extending into rural America, and our coverage is 
much, much better today, but getting better every year. 

Mr.  MCEWEN.  Mr.  Largent  just  makes  a  very  good  point,  and 
that  emphasizes  what  I’ve  been  saying  right  along.  He’s  saying, 
‘‘How  can  we  be  coerced  or  forced  to  build  out  into  these  rural 
areas?’’  Well,  that  is  the  whole  point,  that  is  exactly  what  we’re 
telling everybody. We need this coverage in those areas where they 
will  not  provide  it,  because  they  are  not  going  to  be  coerced  or 
forced  to  do  it.  We  would  do  it  with  private  investors’  money,  and 
we would provide the public with better service and service that we 
need now that they don’t give us.

Mr. LARGENT. I just don’t see where the private investor return— 
gets  a  return  on  his  capital,  building  in  areas  that  are  not  profit-
able in the first place, which is why I think taking the 121⁄2 mega-
hertz—the 12 megahertz that Congress has already set aside in the 
DTV  transition,  and  saying  that’s  for  broadband—and  there’s  no 
commercial  interest  in  that,  it’s  for  broadband—and  we’re  going  to 
build that out, and it’s going to cost money for the Federal Govern-
ment.  It’s  going  to  cost  money  to  build  that  out,  no  question  about 
that.  But  we  think  we  have  the  expertise  in  that  area  to  lend  to 
public safety to help do that in the most expeditious and expedient 
and least expensive way. 

Mr.  O’BRIEN.  Senator,  we  have  the  most  powerful  system  on 
Earth  for  determining  whether  ideas  like  this  can  succeed.  In  the 
marketplace  when  presented  with  an  opportunity  to  participate  in 
the  next-generation  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  wireless  net-
work,  in  every  fiber  of  my  being  and  all  of  my  experience,  I  am 
sure that numerous commercial operators—whether they happen to 
be  current  operators  who  belong  to  CTIA  or  not—numerous  opera-
tors and numerous entrepreneurs will step up for the right, for the 
privilege, of participating in that network. 

Obviously,  I  can’t  prove  it.  It’s  something  that  sits  out  there  in 
the future. But all of my experience suggests—all of my experience 
raising money on Wall Street, all of my experience operating a net-
work—suggests  yes,  that  is  exactly  what  will  happen.  There’s  the 
ability  within  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  to  subsidize  the 
rural  buildout  with  the  more  lucrative  buildout  in  the  major  mar-
kets. That’s the very thing that fuels this idea. 

Again, I urge you to please give us an opportunity to come in and 
explain  it  more  to  you  or  your  staff.  It  is  somewhat  complicated, 
but it is very compelling as you get into it. 

Senator THUNE. Mr. Chairman, I thank you. I’m anxious to hear 
more  about—that  particularly  with  regard  to  the  data  and  other 
advanced  communications  and  how  that  becomes  more  readily 
available in rural areas. 

But you’ve all done a good job of making your points for your re-
spective  points  of  view  today,  and  it’s  helpful.  All  of  us  who  rep-
resent rural areas are very interested in this subject and how best 
to accomplish the objective we all have in mind. 

So, thank you for your testimony, and we’ll continue to keep the 

discussion going. Thanks. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
There  is  a  vote  pending  now,  but  I’d  like  to  call  upon  Senator 

Stevens for the last question. 

Senator STEVENS. Well, I hope, Mr. Chairman, that all the mem-
bers here at this panel will agree to meet with Dale Hatfield to dis-
cuss interoperability solutions. 

I  want  to  call  your  attention  to  what  has  been  deployed  now  by 
the Michigan National Guard. It is a vehicle that has an in-vehicle 
software  solution  to  enable  the  integration  of  advanced  electronics 
communications equipment, security/counterterrorism features, and 
other technologies. This vehicle includes the capability of providing 
radio communications interoperability through a switch that allows 
the first responders to talk to each other via dissimilar communica-
tions systems, which include municipal safety radio, State and Fed-

eral radios, military radios, land lines, cellular, satellite, and what-
ever, all means of communications. 

Now,  I  think  this  conference  could  step  out  of  the  box  and  stop 
talking  about  who  gets  spectrum  and  talk  about  how  we  meet  the 
needs of these first responders now. This vehicle is—working right 
now  for  Michigan.  And  it’s  on  a  demonstration  phase  right  now. 
And I urge you to think about that, going to that meeting and dis-
cussing interoperability solutions, not allocation of spectrum. 

And,  again,  respectfully,  Mr.  O’Brien,  no  matter  what  you  say, 
you’re  asking  us  to  create  a  new  subdivision  of  the  FCC,  giving 
complete control over what amounts to, 54 megahertz, with only 30 
going  out  to  the  industry,  as  a  whole.  That  is,  to  me,  impossible 
for  us  to  do,  fiscally.  We  should  not  it  do  from  the  point  of  view 
of substance either. 

Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
As I indicated, there’s a vote pending. 
I will not be asking questions now, but I will be submitting them 

to all of you. And I hope that you can respond to them. 

The  record  will  be  kept  open  for  2  weeks.  If  you  have  any 
addendums,  new  exhibits,  or  new  statements,  please  submit  them. 
And  I  hope  that  you  will  respond  to  my  questions,  written  ques-
tions. 

Thank you very much. The Committee is adjourned.

A P P E N D I X 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN MCCAIN, U.S. SENATOR FROM ARIZONA 

I am pleased that the Committee is focusing on this very important issue. In fact, 
I  would  go  so  far  as  to  say  that  there  may  be  no  more  important  issue  facing  this 
committee than the issue of public safety interoperable communications. 

The 9/11 Commission’s Final Report states that: ‘‘Command and control decisions 
were  affected  by  the  lack  of  knowledge  of  what  was  happening  30,  60,  90,  and  100 
floors  above.’’  To  remedy  this  problem,  the  9/11  Commission  recommended  the  ‘‘ex-
pedited  and  increased  assignment  of  radio  spectrum  to  public  safety  entities.’’  Con-
gress  did  so  belatedly  last  year  when  it  finally  set  the  date  of  February  17,  2009, 
for  the  availability  of  24  MHz  of  spectrum  to  public  safety  after  years  of  wrangling 
with the National Association of Broadcasters. 

However, public safety has long stated that 24 MHz is not enough to remedy this 
crisis.  On  September  11,  1996,  5  years  to  the  day  before  the  9/11  terrorist  attack, 
the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee released its final report, which stat-
ed that ‘‘Over the next 15 years, as much as an additional 70 MHz of spectrum will 
be  required  to  satisfy  the  mobile  communication  needs  of  the  public  safety  commu-
nity.  The  currently  allocated  public  safety  spectrum  is  insufficient  to  meet  current 
voice and data needs, will not permit deployment of needed advanced data and video 
systems, does not provide adequate interoperability channels, and will not meet fu-
ture needs under projected population growth and demographic changes.’’ If only we 
had  listened  to  the  public  safety  community  in  1996,  we  may  not  have  had  the 
lapses in command and control communications during September 11, 2001. 

Over 10 years later, public safety is still grappling with inadequate spectrum and 
radio communication systems that do not communicate with one another. And Con-
gress sits here debating the issue. 

That is why last week I announced plans to introduce legislation to provide more 
spectrum to public safety for an interoperable national broadband network. The net-
work, which would be created by providing an additional 30 MHz of radio spectrum 
in  the  upper  700  MHz  band  to  public  safety,  would  allow  first  responders  seamless 
nationwide roaming capability and real-time transmission of data. I invite any mem-
ber  of  this  Committee  to  join  me  in  drafting  this  legislation  and  helping  move  it 
through the legislative process swiftly. 

I  fought  for  many  years  to  clear  the  700  MHz  spectrum  for  first  responders  and 
I  do  not  intend  to  allow  the  February  2009  date  to  be  delayed,  contrary  to  media 
reports.  Additionally,  I  have  long  believed  in  a  competitive  marketplace  for  spec-
trum,  and  I  do  not  intend  to  change  my  views  now.  Therefore,  I  ask  that  the  wire-
less  industry,  the  public  safety  community  and  others  review  the  legislation  when 
it  is  introduced  and  start  a  dialog  with  each  other  and  legislators  so  we  can  work 
together  to  remedy  our  Nation’s  interoperable  dilemma  that  has  deadly  con-
sequences. 

The  Federal  Government  has  made  strides  in  developing  a  comprehensive,  inter-
operable  emergency  communications  plan,  establishing  equipment  standards,  fund-
ing  the  purchase  of  emergency  and  interoperable  communications  equipment,  and 
belatedly  making  additional  radio  spectrum  available.  But  none  of  this  is  enough. 
We  must  do  more.  We  are  at  a  watershed  moment  where  we  can  provide  more  of 
the 700 MHz spectrum to solve our national public safety communications crisis and 
greatly  enhance  our  emergency  preparedness.  If  we  do  not  act  now,  this  valuable 
spectrum will be auctioned off and this opportunity will be lost forever. 

I  look  forward  to  working  with  my  colleagues  to  move  legislation  through  the 

Committee and I thank the Chairman for holding this important hearing today.

Senate  Committee  on  Commerce,  Science,  and  Transportation  (‘‘Committee’’)  on 
‘‘The Present and Future of Public Safety Communications.’’ As one of the main pro-
viders  of  reliable  communications  to  the  Gulf  Coast  states  during  and  in  the  after-
math of Hurricane Katrina, and an active participant in the proceedings of the Fed-
eral Communications Commission (‘‘FCC’’) and its Independent Panel Reviewing the 
Impact  of  Hurricane  Katrina  on  Communications  Networks  (‘‘Independent  Panel’’) 1 
Globalstar  believes  that  it  is  well  positioned  to  advise  the  Committee  and  the  FCC 
on  additional  steps  that  may  be  taken  to  ensure  that  the  Nation’s  communications 
infrastructure is prepared for future emergencies. 
I. Background 

Globalstar is now in its seventh year of providing mobile satellite service (‘‘MSS’’) 
voice  and  data  services.  Globalstar’s  services  are  currently  available  in  all  areas  of 
the  world,  except  central  and  southern  Africa,  Southeast  Asia,  and  the  Indian  sub-
continent,  areas  in  which  Globalstar  is  in  the  process  of  negotiating  to  expand  cov-
erage. Globalstar is one of only two FCC-licensed companies that provide MSS using 
battery-powered  handheld  and  vehicle-mounted  phones.  Globalstar’s  MSS  phones 
are  ‘‘operable’’  with  each  other  and  with  any  other  communications  device  that  is 
connected  to  a  public  switched  telephone  or  wireless  network  anywhere,  including 
wireline,  cellular,  and  interconnected  specialized  mobile  radio  and  private  systems. 
As  a  result,  a  Globalstar  user  can  communicate  via  satellite  with  any  other 
Globalstar  user  and  with  anyone  on  or  connected  to  the  worldwide  public  switched 
telephone network. A significant and growing number of Globalstar’s customers are 
first  responders  and  other  public  safety  officials  who  rely,  with  increasingly  fre-
quency,  on  Globalstar’s  products  and  services  to  meet  their  day-to-day  communica-
tions  needs,  and,  more  importantly,  to  ensure  that  they  have  operable  communica-
tions systems during times of emergency. 

Globalstar’s services proved their value to first responders and other public safety 
entities  by  operating  without  interruption  throughout  the  Gulf  Coast  during  Hurri-
cane  Katrina  and  in  its  aftermath.  Because  of  those  services,  thousands  of  first  re-
sponders and other public safety officials whose other means of communication had 
been  destroyed  were  able  to  communicate  among  themselves  and  with  the  outside 
world. Many state and local governments also now seek to ensure that Globalstar’s 
satellite  phones  are  made  an  essential  component  of  their  emergency  response 
plans.  For  example,  Haley  Barbour,  Governor  of  Mississippi,  stated  that,  ‘‘as  a  re-
sult  of  Globalstar’s  performance  [during  Hurricane  Katrina],  [Globalstar’s]  satellite 
phones are now a part of the State Emergency Response Team deployment package 
for  future  emergencies.’’ 2 In  addition,  the  press  and  the  public  have  recognized  the 
immense  value  of  Globalstar’s  services  in  meeting  the  communications  needs  cre-
ated  by  disasters  such  as  the  Gulf  hurricanes.3 President  Bush  has  personally 
praised  Globalstar’s  role  in  the  hurricane  response.4 Building  on  lessons  learned  in 
2005, and by request from certain Federal agencies, Globalstar prepositioned equip-
ment  in  distribution  centers  in  anticipation  of  the  2006  hurricane  season  in  the 
Southeastern United States, and will do the same again this year. 

The effectiveness of Globalstar’s MSS services in such stressed conditions rests on 
the fact that—as an MSS system—Globalstar’s satellite constellation is largely unaf-
fected by ground-based disasters that can disrupt terrestrial services. But this effec-
tiveness  reflects  also  the  reliability  of  Globalstar’s  products,  distribution  channels, 
and  customer  service.  Not  surprisingly,  those  who  have  relied  on  Globalstar’s  serv-
ices  during  recent  disasters  and  emergencies  uniformly  have  praised  them.5 As  a 
result,  a  significant  and  increasing  number  of  Globalstar’s  customers  are  Federal 
agencies  that  have  chosen  Globalstar  to  meet  their  communications  needs  because

eral  Communications  Commission  (FCC),  and  allocated  gateway  coverage  footprints  to  increase

they  recognize  Globalstar’s  reliability  as  a  service  provider.6 For  example,  in  2006 
the  Department  of  Defense  amended  its  policy  regarding  the  procurement  of  sat-
ellite communications equipment, making it easier for individual components of the 
Department  to  procure  Globalstar  voice  and  data  products  for  unclassified  commu-
nications  in  the  United  States.  In  doing  so,  DOD  recognized  that  ‘‘recent  develop-
ments related to disaster relief in the United States indicate a need to broaden the 
available base of MSS for unclassified operations.’’ 7 

Globalstar  has  been  granted  authority  to  integrate  an  Ancillary  Terrestrial  Com-
ponent (‘‘ATC’’) into its MSS system, and currently is the only MSS licensee capable 
of  seamlessly  incorporating  ATC  into  its  existing,  first-generation  MSS  system.8 
Globalstar  is  in  the  process  of  conducting  engineering  analyses  and  meeting  with 
potential  business  partners  regarding  ATC  technologies  and  services.  The  realm  of 
possible MSS/ATC services continues to expand as technologies evolve, and once de-
ployed, Globalstar’s ATC network will bring significant benefits to Globalstar’s pub-
lic  safety  (and  other)  customers.  In  light  of  these  benefits,  in  July  2006  Globalstar 
filed a Petition for Rulemaking to expand its ATC authority to encompass its entire 
spectrum assignment.9 

Globalstar  has  participated  extensively  in  the  FCC’s  Independent  Panel’s  activi-
ties.  Globalstar  submitted  written  comments  recounting  its  experience  in  the  after-
math  of  Katrina  in  advance  of  the  Independent  Panel’s  second  meeting,  and  on 
March 6, 2006, Globalstar’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer traveled to Jack-
son,  Mississippi,  to  testify  before  the  Panel  in  person.10 Globalstar’s  comments  and 
the  written  testimony  of  Globalstar’s  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  are  at-
tached at Exhibits 1 and 2. 
II. Specific Recommendations 

Globalstar  agrees  with  those  witnesses  who  advocate  a  multi-prong  approach  to 
ensuring  that  first  responders  have  reliable  satellite  communications  networks  at 
their  disposal  in  advance  of  future  emergencies.  Specifically,  Globalstar  makes  the 
following recommendations based on its own experiences during past hurricanes and 
other natural disasters: 

1.  Training.  Globalstar  has  observed  that,  although  they  had  the  foresight  to 
stock  Globalstar  phones  and  other  satellite  communications  equipment,  some  first 
responders  had  not  received  adequate  training  in  the  proper  use  of  the  equipment. 
This lack of training accounted for a sizable number of communications failures dur-
ing the first 48 hours after Hurricane Katrina. While in some cases, first responders 
simply had failed to keep the handset batteries charged, in other instances they did 

6 Among  other  Federal  agencies,  for  example,  Globalstar  currently  provides  service  to:  The 
U.S.  Department  of  Homeland  Security;  U.S.  Department  of  Justice;  U.S.  Federal  Emergency 
Management  Agency;  U.S.  Secret  Service;  U.S.  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation;  U.S.  Customs 
Service and Border Protection; U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration; U.S. Department of De-
fense;  U.S.  Northern  Command;  The  Army  National  Guard;  U.S.  Coast  Guard;  U.S.  Marine 
Corps;  National  Security  Agency/Central  Security  Service;  Federal  Bureau  of  Prisons;  Defense 
Intelligence  Agency;  U.S.  Department  of  State;  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency;  Federal 
Aviation Agency; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; U.S. Department of Transpor-
tation; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; U.S. Dept of the Interior; U.S. Depart-
ment of Transportation Federal Highway Administration; and the National Nuclear Security Ad-
ministration.

lary  Terrestrial  Component  for  the  Globalstar  Big  LEO  Mobile  Satellite  Service  (MSS)  System, 
21  FCC  Red  398  (2006).  Globalstar  already  has  proven  the  ease  with  which  ATC  services  can 
be  integrated  into  its  MSS  system  in  a  series  of  demonstrations  in  New  York  and  Washington 
in  the  summer  of  2002,  conducted  pursuant  to  its  ATC  experimental  license  (Call  Sign 
WC2XXD). In those demonstrations, Globalstar used a transportable base station no larger than 
a  suitcase  and  modified  Telit  550  dual  mode  Globalstar/GSM  phones  to  enable  demonstration 
participants  to  place  calls  to  anywhere  in  the  world  through  the  base  station  and  the  satellite 
system into the public switched telephone network. Id. at ¶ 16.

nent  Services  in  its  Entire  Spectrum  Allocation  (filed  June  20,  2006)  (‘‘Globalstar  Petition  for 
Expanded ATC Authority’’). See also Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau Reference In-
formation  Center  Petition  for  Rulemakings  Filed,  Report  No.  2784  (Jul.  27.  2006).  To  date,  the

not  realize  that  satellite  phones  require  a  clear  line  of  sight  between  the  handset 
and  the  satellite  in  order  to  function  effectively.  Accordingly,  Globalstar  believes 
that  it  is  essential  that  first  responders  and  other  emergency  personnel  receive 
proper  training  on  the  operation  of  satellite  equipment,  and  that  such  training  be 
updated  on  an  ongoing  basis  as  technologies  evolve.  Such  training  could  be  orga-
nized for local, state and Federal level first responders under FEMA, and Globalstar 
is  actively  engaged  in  training  and  outreach  initiatives  with  its  public  safety  cus-
tomers so that they are prepared when the next emergency occurs. 

2.  Deployment  Plans.  In  reviewing  its  experiences  during  Hurricane  Katrina  and 
other emergencies, Globalstar has found that first responders often do not have pre- 
emergency  deployment  plans  in  place  that  they  can  invoke  in  advance  of  an  actual 
emergency.  As  a  result,  Globalstar  had  difficulty  determining  where  to  send  its 
phones and other equipment for staging into disaster areas. In the case of Hurricane 
Katrina,  only  through  repeated  contacts  with  FEMA  and  other  officials  was 
Globalstar ultimately advised where to send it equipment, which resulted in signifi-
cant  delays  in  the  delivery  of  Globalstar  equipment  into  the  hands  of  those  who 
needed  it.  In  order  to  avoid  this  problem  in  the  future,  Globalstar  believes  that  it 
is  vital  that  first  responders,  preferably  through  cooperation  at  both  the  state  and 
Federal level, establish a plan to deploy operable equipment in advance of an emer-
gency.  Globalstar  also  recommends  that  such  plans  ensure  military  (i.e.,  National 
Guard)  assistance  to  transport  emergency  communications  equipment  into  the  af-
fected area faster and more efficiently. 

3.  Funding  Mechanisms.  During  and  in  the  aftermath  of  Hurricane  Katrina, 
Globalstar  found  that  although  many  local  and  state  first  responders  already  had 
operable  Globalstar  phones  for  emergencies,  in  a  number  of  cases  they  either  did 
not know how to activate their service through their local or state government pro-
curement  agency,  or  did  not  have  funding  readily  available  for  procurement.  This 
lack  of  available  funding  mechanisms  often  resulted  in  delays  before  Globalstar 
service could be activated, leaving first responders with little or no communications 
capability.  Globalstar  believes  that,  in  order  to  overcome  the  difficulties  that  first 
responders might have in securing budget approval to pay for multiple service sub-
scriptions for phones that they might not use on a day-to-day basis, local, state and 
Federal  agencies  should  examine  whether  there  are  ways  that  they  might  improve 
their contracting methods and/or pool their emergency communications funds to en-
sure  that  they  are  prepared  for  future  emergencies.  For  example,  first  responders 
could seek to share the cost of communications equipment on a statewide (or nation-
wide)  basis  and,  consequently,  receive  volume  discounts  on  their  minutes  of  use. 
Globalstar  also  has  launched  special  pricing  and  service  plans  to  ensure  that 
Globalstar’s  services  are  cost  effective  for  first  responders  with  limited  communica-
tions  budgets.11 Globalstar  believes  that  the  FCC  should  encourage  other  commu-
nications providers to do the same. 

4.  State  of-the-Art  Equipment.  In  Globalstar’s  experience,  because  of  budget  and 
other  procurement  constraints,  first  responders  often  do  not  have  the  same  state- 
of-the-art equipment that its large commercial customers have. There are a number 
of  relatively  new  communications  products  for  first  responders  available  from 
Globalstar  and  other  satellite  service  providers.  For  example,  during  Hurricane 
Katrina,  Globalstar’s  technicians  developed  and  sent  to  FEMA  four  transportable 
Globalstar  Emergency  Communications  System  ‘‘picocells’’—transportable  units 
about the size of a large ice chest that are configured with Globalstar Fixed Access 
Units  (‘‘FAUs’’)  and  GSM  cellular  picocells.  When  combined  with  a  small  PC  not 
much bigger than a laptop, these units essentially create a small local area network 
that  is  capable  of  handling  six  simultaneous  cellular-to-satellite  calls,  five  simulta-
neous  cellular-to-satellite  calls,  and  one  9.6  kbps  data  ‘‘call.’’  Other  satellite-based 
products  that  could  be  of  great  value  to  first  responders  include  narrow  bandwidth 
video,  solar-powered  phones  and  satellite  backhaul  infrastructure  for  cell  phones 
and  other  portable  communications  equipment.  Local,  state  and  Federal  agencies 
and  commercial  operators  must  work  together  to  develop  and  deploy  new  solutions 
for emergency preparedness. 

5.  Health  Care  Communications.  Finally,  Globalstar  believes  that  it  is  vital  that 
the  FCC  take  additional  steps  to  ensure  that  not  only  first  responders,  but  also 
members of the medical community have access to reliable, redundant, state-of-the- 
art  communications  equipment  fur  use  during  times  of  emergency.  Globalstar  pro-
vides  satellite  communications  services  to  approximately  1,100  hospital  and  other 
health care facility subscribers, many of which have multiple Globalstar phones. In

69 

addition,  Globalstar  has  taken  concrete  steps  to  ensure  that  its  services  are  made 
available  to  additional  hospitals  and  other  health  care  providers  that  normally 
might  not  seek  out  satellite  equipment  due  to  cost  constraints.12 But  still  today, 
many  hospitals  and  other  health  care  centers  only  have  terrestrial  communications 
networks  at  their  disposal,  leaving  them  ill-prepared  in  the  event  of  future  natural 
or manmade disasters. 
III. Conclusion 

Globalstar respectfully submits the above recommendations to aid the Committee 
and the FCC in their efforts to facilitate interoperability among first responders and 
to ensure that the Nation is prepared for future emergencies. 

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION INDEPENDENT PANEL REVIEWING THE 

IMPACT OF HURRICANE KATRINA 

Exhibit 1 

Comment of Globalstar, LLC 
Public Notice DA 06–57 
January 27, 2006 

In  the  aftermath  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  Globalstar  was  one  of  a  very  small  num-
ber  of  telecommunications  companies  serving  the  Gulf  Coast  region  whose  services 
were  not  disrupted.  We  are  one  of  only  two  FCC-licensed  companies  that  provide 
mobile  satellite  services  (‘‘MSS’’)  using  battery-powered  handheld  and  vehicle- 
mounted  phones.  Our  MSS  phones  are  ‘‘operable’’  with  each  other  and  with  any 
other  communications  device  that  is  connected  to  a  public-switched  telephone  or 
wireless network anywhere, including wireline, cellular, and interconnected special-
ized  mobile  radio  and  private  systems.1 As  a  result,  a  Globalstar  user  can  commu-
nicate via satellite with any other Globalstar user and with anyone on or connected 
to  the  worldwide  public-switched  telephone  network.  Globalstar’s  services  proved 
their value to first responders and other public safety entities by operating without 
interruption  throughout  the  Gulf  Coast  during  the  hurricanes  and  in  their  after-
math. 

In his Written Statement of September 29, 2005, before the House Subcommittee 
on  Telecommunications  and  the  Internet  Committee  on  Energy  and  Commerce 
(‘‘September 29 Hearing’’), Chairman Kevin Martin noted: 

Fortunately, satellite service providers did not experience damage to their infra-
structure.  They  have  helped  to  bridge  some  of  the  gaps  left  by  the  outages  by 
providing  satellite  phones  and  video  links  to  law  enforcement  officials,  medical 
personnel, emergency relief personnel, and news outlets. 

The  Chairman’s  comment  is  absolutely  true,  but  it  fails  to  capture  the  vital  role 
that satellite phones and data terminals played in the days, weeks, and months fol-
lowing  Hurricanes  Rita  and  Wilma,  as  well  as  Katrina.  MSS  is  not  a  service  that 
is  ‘‘nice  to  have’’  or  a  ‘‘bridge  service’’  that  will  make  do  until  terrestrial  services 
are  restored.  To  the  contrary,  MSS  is  an  increasingly  essential  service  for  legions 
of  government  and  non-government  customers  who  require  communications  during 
emergencies  or  in  remote  areas  or  who  simply  want  telecommunications  capability 
that they know will work under virtually all conditions. 

We  here  provide  a  summary  of  Globalstar’s  response  to  the  Hurricane  Katrina 

emergency. 

• In advance of Hurricane Katrina: 

» Prepositioned phone inventory to strategic locations 
» Re-allocated  coverage  footprints  of  Texas  and  Florida  Gateway  earth  stations 

to increase capacity in Gulf region 

» Trained  network  operations  team  to  monitor  usage  patterns  in  real-time  to 

manage anticipated traffic increase effectively 

12 For example, in 2004 the Iroquois Healthcare Association (IHA) used grant funding to pur-
chase one in-hospital telephone, one portable telephone and one laptop computer with an Inter-
net  connection  through  Globalstar  for  each  of  29  hospitals  in  12  counties  to  provide  redundant 
communications for use during times of emergency. See Signal—Armed Forces Communications 
and Electronics Association, April 1, 2004 (Volume 58; Issue 8), 2004 WLNR 15277393. 

1 In his testimony at the September 29 Hearing, Satellite Industry Association Chairman Tony 
Trujillo  presented  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  role  and  importance  of  the  satellite  industry 
to emergency preparedness. We incorporate Mr. Trujillo’s testimony by reference.

» Donated about 100 phones each to the Governors of Louisiana and Mississippi 
» Activated  and  deployed  roughly  10,000  additional  phones  within  1  week  to 

FEMA and other state and Federal agencies 

» Activated and deployed some 2,000 simplex data terminals so that FEMA and 
other agencies could reliably track their mobile and fixed assets such as gen-

We have attached as an Appendix a public version of our principal e-mail reports 

to the FCC staff between August 30 and September 22, 2005. 

Even  though  Globalstar’s  calling  increased  566  percent  in  the  week  following 
Katrina  compared  with  the  week  preceding  Katrina,  we  were  able  to  maintain  our 
quality  of  service  to  ensure  that  FEMA  and  other  first  responders  had  adequate 
service.  Our  efforts  were  recognized  by  public  officials,  including  President  George 
Bush and Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour, as well as national publications such 
as the Wall Street Journal (in its edition of November 3, 2005). 

The  point  that  must  not  be  lost  amid  public  officials’  concern  about  the  lack  of 
‘‘interoperability’’  among  the  heritage  private  radio  systems  licensed  to  police,  fire, 
and  other  first  responders  is  that  MSS  systems  already  provide  ‘‘operability’’  for 
public  safety,  national  security,  and  disaster  management.  Globalstar  proved  this 
during  two  consecutive  hurricane  seasons—2004  and  2005.  The  Commission  can 
support  the  satellite  industry  and  assist  its  fellow  government  agencies  by  helping 
to  increase  awareness  of  the  communications  capabilities  already  available  via  sat-
ellite  and  by  encouraging  agencies  to  coordinate  among  themselves  to  develop  con-
tingency  plans  using  phones  and  networks  that  will  always  work  during  emer-
gencies.

SELECTION OF GLOBALSTAR STATUS REPORTS TO FCC 

FOLLOWING HURRICANE KATRINA 

8/31/05 

Here  is  some  additional  information  about  Globalstar’s  response  to  the  hurricane 
emergency.  Per  our  conversation,  our  gateway  earth  stations  are  not  in  the  hurri-
cane  zone,  and  we  have  no  outages  at  all  on  our  system.  The  gateways  serving  the 
hurricane  area  are  in  Sebring,  Florida  and  Clifton,  Texas.  I  have  attached  the  cov-
erage  maps  that  we  submitted  with  our  Sebring  license  application,  which  is  cur-
rently pending. We are operating Sebring under STA granted July 13. 

At this time, we are working from California and Canada (unfortunately, our Gulf 
States  distribution  manager  based  in  southern  Mississippi  lost  his  home  and  has 
not been able to ‘‘be on the scene’’ for us), primarily with FEMA and also with Sen-
ator  Landrieu’s  office.  The  emergency  escalated  so  suddenly  yesterday  that  state 
agencies are still reacting. 

Globalstar  distributes  phones  and  service  through  a  network  of  dealers  and  its 
own  800  number  and  website.  As  to  phones,  in  the  last  36  hours  or  so  we  have 
shipped 500 phones from our warehouse here in California to FEMA at FEMA’s des-
ignated location. In addition, dealers and individual customers calling the 800 num-
ber  have  ordered  another  1,400  phones.  (We  normally  activate  about  2,000  phones 
in the U.S. in an entire month.) These phones are activated and shipped as ordered 
from  our  provisioner,  Unigistics.  While  the  vast  majority  of  our  U.S.  phones  are 
Globalstar/CDMA  phones  manufactured  by  QUALCOMM,  we  also  have  a  supply  of 
Globalstar/GSM  phones  manufactured  by  our  Italian  vendor,  Telit,  which  are  dis-
tributed primarily in Europe. We have been shipping the latter as well, and we are 
modifying our network to serve them.

With respect to the network, we have taken the steps necessary to increase capac-

ity to accommodate the much greater than anticipated call volume. Specifically: 

1. We will triple the Globalstar/GSM capacity of the Sebring gateway by Friday 
Sept. 2. 
2. We will increase the PSTN interconnect capacity at Clifton by 50 percent by 
Friday  Sept.  2  and  again  by  another  50  percent  (of  original  capacity)  by  Sept. 
9. This will allow us to avoid blocked calls and busy signals. 
3.  We  will  increase  Globalstar/GSM  capacity  of  the  Clifton  Gateway  2.5  times 
by Friday Sept. 2. 
4. We will increase the overall airlink capacity at Clifton by 50 percent by Sept. 
9. 
5. We will continue to make adjustments as necessary to meet demand. 

[We] will keep you informed about developments in the Globalstar System as they 

occur. Please do not hesitate to contact [us] by phone or e-mail.

Further to the information that [we] sent you this morning— 
One  of  the  two  T1  trunks  connecting  the  Sebring,  Florida,  and  Clifton,  Texas, 
Gateways  went  down  after  the  hurricane.  Half  of  our  GSM  capacity  riding  on  that 
trunk  was  lost.  Our  Operations  Department  quickly  rearranged  our  U.S./Canada 
network  configuration  and  freed  up  some  capacity  on  the  remaining  trunk.  The  ar-
rangement  now  allows  us  more  GSM  call  capacity  than  when  we  had  both  trunks 
up. 

As  to  phone  sales,  we  received  orders  for  another  2,750  phones  today.  Our  provi-
sioning company has added staff to activate phones and will work through the week-
end. They can now activate about 1,400 per day (versus a typical 80 per day), which 
will  cause  a  few  days’  backlog  because  of  the  unprecedented  number  of  orders.  We 
have  asked  whether  they  can  add  additional  temporary  staff.  Our  Canadian  phone 
battery  supplier  has  placed  orders  for  battery  components  and  will  be  significantly 
increasing its production of batteries. The supplier currently has sufficient inventory 
for the next couple of weeks. 

We have donated 100 phones to the States of Louisiana and Mississippi. 
[We] will provide you with an update tomorrow.

Open Letter From the Desk of JAY MONROE 
Chairman and CEO Globalstar, LLC 

As  the  tragedy  in  the  Gulf  continues  to  develop,  our  thoughts  and  prayers  are 
with  those  affected.  Beyond  our  concern  we  are  working  to  ensure  that  Globalstar 
provides  needed  communications  to  help  save  lives  and  property  as  the  country 
bands together to help the victims of this unparalleled event. 

The  physical  damage  to  the  region  has  widely  affected  land-based  communica-
tions, resulting in many response organizations turning to Globalstar satellite serv-
ice.  We  have  planned  and  trained  for  this  kind  of  situation,  but  the  magnitude  of 
the  crisis  is  staggering,  and  many  have  asked  us  what  we  are  doing  in  response. 
Here are some highlights:

response agencies, in order to help the region. 

Network Quality 

Globalstar  was  designed  from  the  start  to  provide  reliable  service  regardless  of 
events  on  the  ground.  Our  network  team  is  monitoring  usage  to  ensure  that  we  ef-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:58 Oct 06, 2010 Jkt 039473 PO 00000 Frm 00075 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39473.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

72 

fectively  manage  the  sudden  increase  in  system  usage.  Over  the  past  several  days, 
we have: 

• Doubled capacity for Globalstar calls to landline phones 
• Increased active Globalstar spectrum allocation to handle increased volume 
• Re-allocated  gateway  coverage  footprints  to  increase  capacity  in  the  Gulf  area 
• Continually monitored usage to accommodate regional usage increases 
As  with  all  telecommunications  systems  there  may  be  instances  where  calls  can-
not  be  completed  during  periods  of  intensified  usage.  These  occurrences  are  being 
minimized with our initial efforts, and our work is ongoing to ensure maximum net-
work availability during this crisis. 
Customer Care 

Globalstar  is  providing  full  support  with  many  employees  working  well  beyond 
scheduled  hours  in  the  United  States  and  Canada.  While  current  wait  times  and 
activation  times  may  be  longer  than  normal,  every  caller  who  waits  will  be  an-
swered. 
Contact 

If you would like to purchase Globalstar products please call 1–877–728–7466. For 
existing  customers  who  may  have  questions,  contact  Globalstar  Customer  Care  at 
1–877–452–5782.  Media  inquiries  should  be  directed  to  John  Dark,  Senior  Mar-
keting Manager, Globalstar at 408–933–4413. 

On  a  personal  note,  my  home  is  in  New  Orleans  and  most  of  my  family  lives 
there. None of us have received a reliable report on the condition of our houses and 
neighborhoods, and all of us are among the displaced at this time. While it is great 
solace to know that Globalstar is an important tool in aiding relief workers and indi-
viduals  in  the  area,  I  will  share  with  you  my  deep  anguish  over  the  losses  we  are 
all experiencing. 
Sincerely,

For  the  last  several  days  Globalstar  has  been  recording  more  than  20,000  calls 
and  60,000  minutes  per  day  through  our  Clifton,  TX,  Gateway  and  an  additional 
2,500  calls  and  7,500  minutes  through  Sebring,  FL.  We  believe  that  the  majority 
of these are FEMA calls although we cannot be certain. 

FEMA  has  ordered  several  thousand  of  our  ‘‘AXTracker’’  simplex  data  modems. 
The  AXTracker  is  a  battery-operated,  self-contained  telemetry  device  designed  for 
asset tracking and fleet management in remote regions. We understand that FEMA 
is using these to keep track of its emergency equipment in the field such as portable 
generators. 

Our  network  seems  to  be  functioning  properly.  We  had  one  problem  with  a  two- 
circuit  private  line  provided  by  Sprint  connecting  Sebring  and  Clifton.  One  circuit 
went  down  at  the  beginning  of  last  week.  We  contacted  NCS  and  our  Sprint  sales 
rep and got the circuit back up quickly.

Globalstar  has  constructed  two  of  its  planned  four  ‘‘Globalstar  Emergency  Com-
munications Systems’’ (GECS) and hopes to ship the two to FEMA (or other govern-
ment agencies) by tomorrow. There are two components: (1) A water-resistant crate 
about 3.5 x 2 x 1.5 feet houses six Globalstar fixed access units (FAUs). The GECS 
fits in the back of a pickup truck or SUV or in a small boat. The FAUs will be con-
nected  by  30-foot  cables  to  their  antennas,  which  can  be  placed  anywhere  there  is 
line  of  sight  to  the  satellites.  The  user  can  plug  any  six  telephones  into  the  FAUs 
through  standard  RJII  jacks.  The  crate  must  be  connected  to  a  110V  power  source. 
(2)  A  cellular  GSM  picocell,  which  is  a  device  about  the  size  of  a  dinner  plate  two 
inches  thick.  Two  picocells  can  be  connected  to  the  FAUs  through  a  small  PC  not 
much  bigger  than  a  laptop.  The  PC  provides  all  the  functionality  of  a  cellular  base 
station.  The  picocell  is  manufactured  by  Intelcomm.  Additional  picoccells  could  be 
added by adding more ports on the PC. 

When  two  picocells  are  connected  to  the  FAUs  through  the  ‘‘base  station,’’  the 
whole unit is capable of processing fifteen simultaneous cellular-to-cellular calls (es-

sentially  creating  a  small  local  area  network)  or  six  simultaneous  cellular-to-sat-
ellite calls, or a combination. Initially, Globalstar will provide preprogrammed GSM 
SIM  cards  with  special  phone  numbers.  Eventually,  we  will  work  out  the  network 
connectivity  so  that  any  GSM  cell  phone  can  be  used  with  the  GECS.  All  of  the 
GECS  equipment  can  carried  by  two  people  and  set  up  wherever  there  is  a  110V 
power source.

As you know, Globalstar’s principal U.S. Gateway is in Clifton, Texas, near Waco. 
Right now, the National Weather Service is showing that Rita will track fairly close 
to  Waco.  We  do  not  expect  any  adverse  effects  from  rain  or  flooding.  Clifton  is  cur-
rently  providing  the  primary  coverage  in  the  Katrina  area.  Our  contingency  plan 
provides  for  expanding  the  coverage  in  Sebring,  Florida  and  the  two  Canada  Gate-
ways  if  we  have  to  shut  down  Clifton  briefly.  This  will  ‘‘stretch’’  the  other  three 
Gateway coverage areas, which could result in a reduction in the length of time that 
any given call can be maintained in the area normally covered by Clifton. However, 
there will be no total loss of service anywhere. We can execute the contingency plan 
with about 90 minutes’ advance notice. 

[We] will keep you apprised of developments as they occur. 
[We]  don’t  yet  have  anything  specific  to  report  regarding  the  provision  of  addi-
tional  emergency  phones  to  the  Texas  Gulf  coast  except  that  we  have  our  estab-
lished relationship with FEMA and will continue to work cooperatively. 

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION INDEPENDENT PANEL REVIEWING THE 

IMPACT OF HURRICANE KATRINA 

Exhibit 2 

Statement of JAMES MONROE III 
Chief Executive Officer 
Globalstar, LLC 
March 6, 2006 

Chairwoman Victory and distinguished Members of the Panel. I very much appre-
ciate the opportunity to appear before you on behalf of Globalstar. Globalstar is one 
of  the  original  ‘‘Big  LEO’’  mobile  satellite  systems  licensed  by  the  Federal  Commu-
nications  Commission  more  than  a  decade  ago.  Like  the  rest  of  the  telecommuni-
cations  industry,  we  suffered  through  the  doldrums  of  the  business  recession  that 
began in 2000. We entered chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2002, and the pundits, the ter-
restrial wireless industry and even many of our regulators gave us up for dead. But 
our  loyal  and  dedicated  employees  and,  most  importantly,  our  customers,  did  not 
give  us  up  for  dead.  Why  not?  Because  we  provide  a  unique  suite  of  products  and 
services  that  government  and  industry  have  come  to  rely  upon  in  remote  areas  of 
the globe and during the emergencies that routinely disable terrestrial wireline and 
wireless communications for a period of time. 

We all know that Hurricane Katrina was a an extraordinary event with an unusu-
ally disruptive impact on the land-based telecommunications infrastructure. We also 
all  know  that  Government’s  response  to  the  emergency  was  not  acceptable  to  the 
public  or  to  its  elected  officials.  My  presentation  today  will  address,  first, 
Globalstar’s  response  to  the  emergency  as  we  experienced  it  and,  second,  our  rec-
ommendations  to  ensure  a  faster  and  better  coordinated  response  if  and  when  the 
next such event occurs. 

In  the  aftermath  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  Globalstar  was  one  of  a  very  small  num-
ber—perhaps  fewer  than  five—of  telecommunications  companies  serving  the  Gulf 
Coast  region  whose  services  were  not  disrupted.  We  are  one  of  only  two  FCC-li-
censed  companies  that  currently  provide  mobile  satellite  services,  or  ‘‘MSS,’’  using 
battery-powered  handheld  and  vehicle-mounted  phones.  Our  satellites  serve  the 
Southeast  United  States  with  the  aid  of  our  Gateway  satellite  Earth  stations  near 
Waco, Texas, and Sebring, Florida. Because our satellite constellation is located 850 
miles  above  the  Earth’s  surface,  as  long  as  either  one  of  those  ground  stations  is 
undisturbed, our customers in the Gulf Coast area can obtain uninterrupted service 
even when all terrestrial communications in the area are unavailable. 

Much  of  the  debate  among  telecommunications  policymakers  following  Hurricane 
Katrina  concerned  the  lack  of  ‘‘interoperability’’  among  proprietary  radio  systems 
used by local, state and Federal police, fire and rescue and other emergency assist-
ance agencies, which I refer to collectively as ‘‘First Responders.’’ This lack of inter-
operability is indeed a problem that these agencies and state and Federal regulators 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:58 Oct 06, 2010 Jkt 039473 PO 00000 Frm 00077 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39473.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

74 

have  been  attempting  to  solve  for  years.  However,  the  lack  of  interoperability  was 
not an impediment for those agencies that had MSS phones at their disposal during 
and  after  the  hurricane.  This  is  because  MSS  phones,  which  use  globally-allocated 
radio  spectrum,  and  which  do  not  rely  on  the  terrestrial  infrastructure  to  function 
effectively,  are  ‘‘operable’’  with  each  other  and  via  satellite  with  any  other  commu-
nications  device  that  is  connected  to  the  public  switched  telephone  network  or  to  a 
wireless network anywhere. 

If  I  may,  I  would  like  to  summarize  briefly  Globalstar’s  actions  both  before  and 

immediately after Hurricane Katrina came ashore. 

In advance of Hurricane Katrina, we— 

» Prepositioned our phone inventory to strategic locations such as Baton Rouge; 
» Re-allocated  the  coverage  footprints  of  our  Texas  and  Florida  Gateway  earth 

stations to increase our capacity in the Gulf Coast region; and 

» Prepared our network operations team to monitor usage patterns in real-time 

to manage the anticipated traffic increase effectively. 

Immediately after the hurricane moved out of Louisiana and Mississippi, we— 

» Within  24  hours,  increased  available  network  capacity  in  the  affected  areas 

by 60 percent; 

» Donated  about  100  phones  each  to  the  Governors  of  Louisiana  and  Mis-

sissippi; 

» Within  about  1  week,  activated  and  deployed  roughly  10,000  additional 

phones to FEMA and other state and Federal agencies; 

» Activated and deployed some 2,000 simplex data terminals so that FEMA and 
other agencies could reliably track their mobile and fixed assets, such as gen-
erators and trailers; 

» Doubled the capacity for Globalstar calls to landline phones; 
» Continuously  reallocated  Gateway  capacity  and  coverage  to  maintain  service 

quality in the Gulf Coast region; and 

» Developed  and  sent  to  FEMA.  four  new  transportable  Globalstar  Emergency 
Communications  System  ‘‘picocells,’’  which  mate  GSM  cell  phones  with  a 
Globalstar  fixed  phone  for  backhaul  to  create  a  small,  self-contained  local 
area network. 

Even  though  Globalstar’s  calling  increased  a  staggering  566  percent  in  the  week 
following  Hurricane  Katrina,  compared  with  the  week  preceding,  we  were  able  to 
maintain  our  quality  of  service  to  ensure  that  FEMA  and  other  First  Responders 
had  uninterrupted  communications  capability.  Why  were  we  able  to  do  this?  Be-
cause we were prepared. 

I do not mean to imply that everything worked smoothly—it did not. No company 
or government agency can anticipate each potential point of failure during a calam-
ity.  Even  if  we  could,  the  cost  of  designing  hardware  and  software  and  preparing 
ourselves  for  the  unthinkable  would  be  cost-prohibitive.  We  design  our  equipment 
and  procedures  to  work  properly  ‘‘nearly  all  the  time.’’  This  does  not  mean  that  we 
cannot take steps to reduce the points of failure. 

With  that  in  mind,  I  would  like  to  share  with  you  Globalstar’s  observations  and 
recommendations  based  on  our  experience,  not  only  with  Hurricane  Katrina,  but 
also with Hurricane Wilma some weeks later and with the series of hurricanes that 
struck Florida during 2004. 

First,  we  found  that  some  First  Responders,  who  had  the  foresight  to  stock 
Globalstar  phones  and  other  satellite  communications  equipment,  had  not  received 
adequate  training  in  proper  use  of  the  equipment.  This  lack  of  training  accounted 
for  a  sizable  number  of  communications  failures  during  the  first  48  hours  after  the 
hurricane.  In  some  cases,  First  Responders  simply  had  failed  to  keep  the  handset 
batteries charged, just as we at home might fail to keep fresh batteries in our flash-
lights  in  the  event  of  a  power  failure.  Others  did  not  realize  that  satellite  phones 
require  a  clear  line  of  sight  between  the  handset  and  the  satellite  in  order  to  func-
tion  effectively.  Accordingly,  it  is  essential  the  First  Responders  and  other  emer-
gency  personnel  receive  proper  training  on  the  operation  of  satellite  equipment. 
There  is  no  reason  that  such  training  cannot  be  organized  for  local,  state  and  Fed-
eral  First  Responders  under  FEMA,  and  Globalstar  is  actively  engaged  in  training 
and  outreach  initiatives  with  its  public  safety  customers  so  that  they  are  prepared 
when the next emergency occurs. 

Second, we found that First Responders generally did not have pre-emergency de-
ployment plans that they could invoke in advance of the actual emergency. As a re-
sult,  Globalstar  had  difficulty  determining  where  to  send  our  phones  and  other 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:58 Oct 06, 2010 Jkt 039473 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39473.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

75 

equipment  for  staging  into  the  disaster  area.  Only  through  repeated  contacts  with 
FEMA and other officials were we ultimately advised to send our equipment to stag-
ing  areas—primarily  Baton  Rouge.  In  order  to  avoid  this  problem  in  the  future,  it 
is vital that First Responders, preferably through cooperation at both the state and 
Federal  level,  publish  a  plan  to  deploy  operable  equipment  in  advance  of  an  emer-
gency.  We  also  recommend  that  any  such  plan  ensure  military—for  example,  Na-
tional  Guard—assistance  to  transport  emergency  communications  equipment  into 
the affected area faster and more efficiently. 

Third, we found in many cases that although local and state First Responders al-
ready  had  operable  Globalstar  phones  for  emergencies,  they  either  did  not  know 
how  to  activate  their  service  through  their  local  or  state  government  procurement 
agency, or did not have funding readily available for procurement. It is understand-
able  that  First  Responders  might  not  be  able  to  secure  budget  approval  to  pay  for 
multiple  service  subscriptions  for  phones  that  they  might  not  use  on  a  day-to-day 
basis;  however,  if  local,  state  and  Federal  agencies  were  able  to  improve  their  con-
tracting  methods  and  pool  their  emergency  communications  funds,  they  could  share 
the  cost  statewide,  or  even  nationally,  of  emergency  preparedness  and  could,  con-
sequently, receive volume discounts on their minutes of use. 

Fourth, we found that First Responders often did not have the same state-of-the- 
art  equipment  that  our  large  commercial  customers  have.  There  are  a  number  of 
relatively  new  solutions  for  First  Responders  available  from  Globalstar  and  other 
satellite service providers. As I noted previously, Globalstar’s technicians developed 
and  sent  to  FEMA  four  transportable  Globalstar  Emergency  Communications  Sys-
tem  ‘‘picocells.’’  This  product  is  quite  similar  to  an  ancillary  terrestrial  component, 
or  ATC,  product  that  we  intend  to  develop  now  that  the  FCC  has  authorized  us  to 
implement ATC. Other satellite-based products that could be of great value to First 
Responders  include  narrow  bandwidth  video,  solar-powered  phones  and  satellite 
backhaul  infrastructure  for  cell  phones  and  other  portable  communications  equip-
ment.  Local,  state  and  Federal  agencies  and  commercial  operators  must  work  to-
gether to develop and deploy new solutions for emergency preparedness. 

In  summary,  we  recommend  that  First  Responders  train  their  employees  on  the 
proper  use  of  equipment,  deploy  emergency  equipment  in  advance  of  a  disaster, 
work  together  to  share  resources  and  funding,  and  work  with  industry  to  procure 
and maintain, state-of-the-art equipment. 

That  concludes  my  prepared  statement.  I  respectfully  refer  the  Panel  to

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PAUL J. COSGRAVE, COMMISSIONER, DEPARTMENT OF 

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS, CITY OF NEW YORK 

New York City strongly commends the Senate Commerce Committee for address-
ing  our  concerns  with  the  $1  billion  public  safety  interoperability  grant  program 
that  the  Committee  established  last  year.  In  the  recently  proposed  ‘‘Interoperable 
Emergency  Communications  Act’’  (S.  385),  which  provides  the  National  Tele-
communications  and  Information  Administration  (NTIA)  with  additional  guidance 
on how to allocate the $1 billion in interoperability funding, the Committee removes 
a counterproductive linkage between funding eligibility and the use of specific spec-
trum. 

Last year, Congress expedited the release of $1 billion in grants to state and local 
public safety agencies to support the deployment of interoperable public safety com-
munications  systems.  While  applauding  Congressional  recognition  of  the  need  for 
such  funding,  the  City  of  New  York  was  greatly  troubled  that  such  grants  would 
be  directed  solely  toward  a  newly  reallocated  portion  of  the  wireless  spectrum.  As 
Mayor  Bloomberg  made  clear  in  Senate  testimony  and  a  separate  letter  (attached), 
this statutory preference for newly allocated public safety spectrum would not serve 
the interests of high-risk cities like the City of New York. 

New York City, however, urges the Committee to go further. A provision in S. 385 
would  not  permit  interoperability  grants  to  be  provided  directly  to  localities.  Espe-
cially in the Nation’s highest risk areas, wireless public safety communications sys-
tems  are  funded  and  deployed  by  municipal  agencies.  In  the  initial  hours  after  an 
event, state agencies are unable to play a significant role in emergency response in 
major metropolitan areas. Indeed, New York City has been a leader in the develop-
ment  of  public  safety  communications.  New  York  City  has  already  invested  more 
than  $1  billion  in  our  own  public  safety  infrastructure,  including  a  commitment  of 
well  over  $0.5  billion  to  upgrade  our  interoperable  voice  and  data  networks  since 
the September 11, 2001 attacks.

Unfortunately, S. 385 would effectively prohibit interoperability grants from being 
provided  directly  to  the  agencies  that  need  them  most:  local  first  response  agencies 
in  high-risk  urban  areas.  In  particular,  the  bill  would  require  the  Assistant  Sec-
retary  of  NTIA  to  distribute  the  grants  on  the  basis  of  the  USA  PATRIOT  Act  for-
mula, including a states-only distribution and a minimum to each state of 0.75 per-
cent,  which  consumes  40  percent  of  the  funds  without  any  consideration  of  risk.  It 
is New York City’s view that the USA PATRIOT Act formula effectively shifts funds 
away  from  high-risk  areas,  which  the  9/11  Commission  recommended  be  the  basis 
for  all  homeland  security  grant  allocations.  Furthermore,  the  requirement  that 
funds  be  distributed  to  states  only  ensures  that  the  communications  needs  of  state 
agencies  will  be  given  preference  over  the  needs  of  municipal  agencies,  which  are 
in fact the first responders to all urban emergencies. For example, New York State’s 
interoperable  communications  network  applies  mainly  to  State  agencies—participa-
tion  by  local  agencies  is  ‘‘optional.’’  While  we  intend  to  be  interoperable  with  the 
state’s  new  network,  our  day-to-day  first  responder  communications  would  over-
whelm the state’s system. 

I  appreciate  this  Committee’s  efforts  in  the  area  of  public  safety  interoperability, 
including  its  responsiveness  to  New  York  City’s  initial  concerns.  However,  the  City 
of New York respectfully, but most urgently, requests that S. 385 be modified to ad-
dress the issues outlined above. 

THE NATIONAL GRANGE OF THE ORDER OF PATRONS OF HUSBANDRY 

Washington, DC, February 8, 2007 

Hon. TED STEVENS, 
Vice Chairman, 
U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 
Washington, DC. 
Vice Chairman Stevens: 

Attached  is  a  copy  of  the  National  Grange’s  November  28,  2006  filing  with  the 
FCC  supporting  the  decision  to  dismiss  a  petition  by  Cyren  Call  to  create  a  Public 
Safety  Broadband  Trust.  The  National  Grange  believes  this  proposal  to  alter  the 
digital television (DTV) provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA 05) will 
he  harmful  to  rural  areas  and  represents  a  setback  in  Congress’  effort  to  provide 
our public safety professionals with a reliable and interoperable communications in-
frastructure. 

With the inclusion of DTV provisions within the DRA 05, Congress took a defini-
tive step to bring our Nation’s television broadcast services into the digital age while 
freeing  up  valuable  spectrum  in  the  700  MHZ  band  for  new  commercial  tele-
communications  services  as  well  as  dedicating  a  block  of  24  MHZ  of  spectrum  for 
our  first  responders.  As  you  can  see  in  our  filing  to  the  FCC,  this  represented  a 
thoughtful compromise among numerous stakeholders. 

The new commercial applications resulting from the auction of the 700 MHZ band 
represent an opportunity for traditionally underserved rural communities to benefit 
from  more  expansive  and  consistent  advanced  telecommunications  services.  The 
Cyren  Call  proposal  directly  threatens  the  application  of  those  services.  The  Na-
tional  Grange  respectfully  asks  for  your  continued  support  and  swift  implementa-
tion  of  the  DTV  provisions  within  the  DRA  05,  including  an  expedited  auction  of 
the 700 MHZ spectrum. 

Sincerely,

THE NATIONAL GRANGE OF THE ORDER OF PATRONS OF HUSBANDRY 

Washington, DC, November 28, 2006 

Hon. KEVIN J. MARTIN, 
Chairman, 
Federal Communications Commission, 
Washington, DC. 
Re: RM–11348 

The  National  Grange,  the  Nation’s  oldest  general  farm  and  rural  public  interest 
organization,  opposes  the  proposal  made  by  Cyren  Call  for  the  creation  of  a  Public 
Safety Broadband Trust, that would he a free give-away of portions of the 700 MHZ 
band  of  spectrum.  The  National  Grange  believes  that  Congress  has  already  taken 
the  necessary  action,  in  the  Deficit  Reduction  Act  of  2005,  (DRA  05)  to  allocate  an 
additional  24  MHZ  of  the  700  MHZ  band  to  first  responders  for  interoperable  com-
munications.  We  strongly  believe  that  the  Cyren  Call  proposal  would  not  be  in  the 
best  interest  of  family  farmers  and  other  residents  of  rural  communities  who  cur-
rently  lack  adequate  commercial  access  to  advanced  telecommunications  tech-
nologies and who currently face disruptions from the transition to digital TV broad-
casting.  We  also  believe  that  Cyren  Call’s  proposal  would  undermine,  not  aid,  Con-
gress’ effort to provide first responders with the timely, reliable communications sys-
tems  they  need,  as  recommended  by  the  9/11  Commission.  As  such  the  National 
Grange  supports  the  decision  by  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  to  dis-
miss Cyren Call’s petition on this matter. 

By  including  digital  TV  (DTV)  provisions  in  the  DRA  05,  Congress  set  in  motion 
a plan to advance the Nation’s conversion of its TV broadcast services to new digital 
technology. This will free up vast amounts of high-quality spectrum in the 700 MHZ 
band,  a  portion  of  which  will  be  made  specifically  available  for  public  safety  uses. 
This  plan  is  entirely  consistent  with  the  recommendations  made  by  the  9/11  Com-
mission. The National Grange believes that the transition to DTV will be especially 
disruptive for rural communities that lack access to competitively priced satellite or 
cable television services and that continue to rely on over-the-air broadcasting to re-
ceive television programming. Nevertheless, the National Grange has supported the 
DTV  transition  provisions  of  the  DRA  2005,  in  part,  because  the  Congress,  in  its 
wisdom,  allocated  a  significant  portion  of  the  newly  available  spectrum  to  become 
available  for  additional  commercial  telecommunications  applications.  These  new 
commercial  applications  of  spectrum  hold  out  a  promise  of  more  robust,  more  reli-
able  and  more  consistent  service  coverage  for  rural  and  fanning  communities  that 
are currently underserved by existing advanced telecommunications technologies. 

The  National  Grange  believes  that  the  provision  of  new  spectrum  in  DRA  05  for 
use  by  first  responders  is  a  critical  step  in  meeting  their  interoperable  communica-
tions  needs  in  times  of  natural  and  manmade  crises.  Funds  for  these  programs,  as 
well as other programs to facilitate the transition to DTV, will come from the public 
auction  of  the  remaining  spectrum  in  the  700  MHZ  band  vacated  by  TV  broad-
casters. The DRA 05 provides up to $1.5 billion for digital set top converter box sub-
sidies that will ease the transition to digital TV for rural consumers. An additional 
$1 billion will be provided to help public safety agencies better deploy and use inter-
operable  communications  systems.  Additional  funds  are  also  provided  for  a  unified 
national alert system ($156 million) and enhanced 911 services ($43 million). 

The  National  Telecommunications  and  Information  Administration  (NTIA)  will 
administer  these  grant  programs.  The  National  Grange  has  already  opened  a  dia-
logue with NTIA to explore ways that we can use our network of nearly 2,800 local 
and  county  Grange  chapters  across  the  United  States  to  assist  in  implementing  a 
public service education program in rural America to facilitate the transition to DTV 
in 2009. Delays in implementing the provisions of DRA 05 related to the DTV tran-
sition  that  might  arise  from  further  reconsideration  of  the  Cyren  Call  proposal

would  complicate  and  disrupt  our  efforts  to  train  and  mobilize  our  volunteer  re-
sources in rural communities across the Nation to participate in public service edu-
cational campaigns regarding the DTV transition. Other non-profit and civic organi-
zations  are  preparing  similar  commitments  of  resources  to  assist  with  this  transi-
tion  in  rural  communities  as  well.  Given  the  disproportionate  impact  that  the  DTV 
transition  will  have  on  rural  communities  and  the  clear  necessity  for  public  service 
educational programs to address those impacts, we believe that further delays in the 
implementation  of  the  DTV  transition  provisions  would  be  directly  contrary  to  the 
legislative intent of the DRA 05. 

The  National  Grange  also  believes  that,  in  this  instance,  auctions  are  the  right 
way  to  allocate  spectrum  to  commercial  telecommunications  service  providers.  Auc-
tions raise billions for the Treasury, and ensure that economic and technical value— 
not  political  favoritism—determines  the  highest  and  best  use  of  the  spectrum.  The 
FCC’s  own  data  clearly  indicates  that,  given  reliable  access  to  these  technologies, 
consumers  in  rural  areas  are  increasingly  turning  to  wireless  technologies  to  serve 
their  communications  needs.  Rural  consumers  recognize  the  convenience,  mobility, 
efficiency and security that wireless technologies can provide. The National Grange 
believes  that  market  demand  for  advanced  telecommunications  services  in  rural 
communities,  coupled  with  appropriate  discretionary  oversight  of  commercial  appli-
cations  of  new  telecommunications  technologies  and  services  by  state  and  Federal 
regulatory  agencies,  is  more  likely  to  result  in  greater  effective  allocation  of  spec-
trum  resources  to  serve  rural  and  farming  communities  than  the  Public  Safety 
Broadband Trust advocated by Cyren Call. 

Under  current  law,  this  spectrum  auction  must  occur  by  January  2008,  but  the 
National  Grange  believes  that  there  is  no  compelling  reason  to  postpone  the  spec-
trum  auction  until  then.  The  sooner  this  auction  occurs,  the  sooner  critical  public 
funds  can  be  used  for  DTV  transition  programs,  for  enhanced  investment  in  first 
responder  networks  and  interoperability  and  for  deficit  reduction.  In  addition  the 
sooner  this  spectrum  auction  occurs,  the  sooner  that  spectrum  resources  can  be 
made  commercially  available  for  deployment  of  advanced  telecommunications  serv-
ices in rural and farming communities. 

Recently, Representative Nancy Pelosi eloquently stated the House of Representa-
tive’s  order  of  business  when  the  Democrats  gained  the  majority.  At  the  top  of  the 
list  was  enactment  of  all  the  recommendations  made  by  the  9/11  Commission.  An-
other point she made was that no program shall advance if it increases the Federal 
deficit.  Implementation  of  the  DRA  05,  as  written,  supports  both  of  these  goals  by 
improving  public  safety  communications  and  by  providing  additional  resources  to 
the U.S. Treasury for deficit reduction. 

In sharp contrast, Cyren Call’s proposal would only advance its own interests, po-
tentially  at  the  expense  of  family  farmers  and  rural  residents  who  live  in  commu-
nities  that  are  currently  underserved  by  advanced  telecommunications  technologies 
and services. It would derail Congress’s carefully thought-out plan and current time 
line  for  the  conversion  to  digital  TV.  It  would  delay  the  timely  allocation  of  spec-
trum for public safety communications and other important public benefits. 

Thank  you  for  your  consideration  of  the  views  of  the  National  Grange  in  opposi-
tion  to  Cyren  Call’s  proposal  for  a  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust.  The  National 
Grange believes that the public interest will best be served if the FCC implements, 
as  enacted,  Congress’s  well-orchestrated  digital  TV  provisions  outlined  in  the  DRA 
05.  These  provisions  will  result  in  new  commercial  applications  of  spectrum  that 
hold  out  a  promise  of  more  robust,  more  reliable  and  more  consistent  service  cov-
erage for rural and farming communities that are currently underserved by existing 
advanced telecommunications technologies. 

Sincerely, 

National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

CHARLES L. WERNER 

Question  1.  Both  CTIA  and  the  FCC  suggest  that  a  national  broadband  network 
can  be  built  on  12  of  the  24  megahertz  that  public  safety  is  currently  expected  to 
receive  following  the  DTV  transition.  Why  do  you  believe  an  additional  30  mega-
hertz is needed? What effect would an additional allocation have on the use of other 
public safety bands?

COMMENTS OF THE NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY TELECOMMUNICATIONS COUNCIL 

The  National  Public  Safety  Telecommunications  Council  (NPSTC)  submits  these 
comments  in  response  to  the  Commission’s  Ninth  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking 
(Ninth  NPRM)  in  the  above  proceedings.1 The  Ninth  NPRM  proposes  rule  changes 
that  the  Commission  believes  would  promote  deployment  of  a  centralized  public 
safety  nationwide  broadband  network  utilizing  the  12  MHZ  wideband  segment 
channels  in  the  700  MHZ  band  currently  allocated  to  local  and  state  agencies 
through the regional planning process. The network would encompass Internet Pro-
tocol based system architecture and be administered by a nationwide licensee. 

It  has  become  increasingly  apparent  to  NPSTC  that  deployment  of  a  nationwide 
public safety broadband network is enormously important for emergency responders 
at  all  levels  of  government:  local,  state  and  Federal.  It  will  be  an  essential  tool  for 
addressing the expanded domestic defense and emergency response obligations of all 
public  safety  agencies.  Such  a  proposal  is  not  a  substitute  for  present  land  mobile 
assignments, including the current 700 MHz narrowband spectrum, that provide for 
public  safety  mission  critical  voice  communications.  However,  a  data  network  will 
serve  growing  critical  needs  if  it  meets  the  expectations  that  the  700  MHz  public 
safety  segment  has  portended;  it  must  encompass  advanced  data  services  that  will 
also include Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) capabilities that will provide a vital 
backup  to  public  safety  mission  critical  land  mobile  voice  systems;  it  must  conquer 
the  historical  public  safety  challenge  of  satisfying  the  most  critical  communications 
requirements  with  highly  limited  or  no  resources;  and  it  must  be  available  to  all 
agencies, small or large, wealthy or poor, rural, suburban or urban. 

NPSTC  believes  that  these  attributes  translate  to  five  principles  which  the  Com-
mission must address if it is to provide a meaningful response to the current public 
safety  communications  situation:  universal  access  by  all  agencies,  sufficient  spec-
trum  to  ensure  commercial  investment  and  public/private  coexistence  on  a  shared 
data  network,  a  modern  data  network  built  to  public  safety  standards  and  able  to 
accommodate changing requirements, a governance structure ensuring public safety 
community  control  and  standards  and  protection  of  mission  critical  voice  spectrum 
from interference. We do not believe these attributes can be realized if public safety 
is  limited  to  the  12  MHZ  of  its  existing  700  MHZ  allocation  as  proposed  in  the 
Ninth  NPRM.  Also,  we  do  not  believe  that  secondary  use  of  the  narrowband  spec-
trum provides any meaningful spectrum supplement for broadband use because the 
areas of the country where there will be the greatest demand for broadband are the 
same  areas  where  the  narrowband  voice  channels  will  be  fully  utilized  once  the 
spectrum  is  cleared  and  systems  are  implemented.  We  also  have  serious  questions 
regarding  the  near-term  viability  of  the  cognitive  technologies  that  would  be  nec-
essary for such broadband/narrowband spectrum sharing.

The  Commission,  Congress,  Administration,  public  safety  and  private  interests 
now  have  a  short  opportunity  to  enact  and  structure  a  nationwide  broadband  net-
work  that  will  satisfy  the  five  principles  identified  above.  Unless  these  principles 
prevail,  the  opportunity  will  be  lost  and  public  safety  communications  will  deterio-
rate  further,  with  many  agencies  left  behind.  Set  forth  below  is  NPSTC’s  path  to 
a  nationwide  broadband  network  that  will  improve  communications  dramatically 
and bring the unity that is vitally necessary to public safety operations. 
The National Public Safety Telecommunications Council 

NPSTC  serves  both  as  a  resource  and  advocate  for  public  safety  organizations  in 
the  United  States  on  matters  relating  to  public  safety  telecommunications.  NPSTC 
is  a  federation  of  public  safety  organizations  dedicated  to  encouraging  and  facili-
tating, through its collective voice, the implementation of the Public Safety Wireless 
Advisory  Committee  (PSWAC)  and  the  700  MHZ  Public  Safety  National  Coordina-
tion  Committee  (NCC)  recommendations.  NPSTC  explores  technologies  and  public 
policy  involving  public  safety  agencies,  analyzes  the  ramifications  of  particular 
issues,  and  submits  comments  to  governmental  bodies  with  the  objective  of  fur-
thering public safety communications worldwide. NPSTC serves as a standing forum 
for  the  exchange  of  ideas  and  information  for  effective  public  safety  telecommuni-
cations. The following 13 organizations participate in NPSTC: 

American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials 
American Radio Relay League 
American Red Cross 
Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies 
Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials—International 
Forestry Conservation Communications Association 
International Association of Chiefs of Police 
International Association of Emergency Managers 
International Association of Fire Chiefs 
International Municipal Signal Association 
National Association of State Emergency Medical Services Officials 
National Association of State Telecommunications Directors 
National Association of State Foresters 
National Association of State Telecommunications Directors 

Several  Federal  agencies  are  liaison  members  of  NPSTC.  These  include  the  De-
partment  of  Agriculture,  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (SAFECOM  Program 
and  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency),  Department  of  Commerce  (Na-
tional  Telecommunications  and  Information  Administration),  Department  of  the  In-
terior, and the Department of Justice (National Institute of Justice, CommTech Pro-
gram). 
Current Proposals Addressing Broadband 

The  Ninth  NPRM  is  the  most  recent  in  a  series  of  Commission  proceedings  that 
address  the  optimal  use  of  this  critical  portion  of  the  spectrum.  In  addition  to  this 
proposal for deployment of a nationwide broadband public safety network, the Com-
mission also has open proceedings in which it is examining the structure of the 700 
MHz  public  safety  allocation,  the  reallocation  of  certain  700  MHz  guard  band  seg-
ments and service rules for the yet-to-be auctioned 700 MHz commercial allocation. 
These converging proceedings present a pivotal opportunity to propose the 700 MHz 
capacity  needed  to  support  an  economically  viable,  sustainable,  nationwide, 
broadband  public  safety  network,  if  sufficient  spectrum  is  made  available  to  do  so. 
By  examining  these  proposals  one  can  discern  a  path  that  reflects  the  principles 
identified  herein  and  that  will  thereby  unify  public  safety  communications  while 
providing  commercial  interests  a  viable  opportunity  to  invest  in  and  use  the  net-
work. 

The  Commission  first  began  to  explore  how  to  provide  broadband  capability  for 
public  safety  from  the  current  700  MHz  wideband  and  guard  band  segments  while 
preserving  local  discretion  in  choosing  whether  the  spectrum  would  be  utilized  for 
broadband  or  wideband  applications.2 Public  safety  input  to  that  proceeding  was

clear  that  the  Commission  needs  to  provide  the  option  to  choose  wideband  or 
broadband  solutions  within  the  current  700  MHz  data  spectrum  as  requirements 
dictate.  Under  the  Access  Spectrum/Pegasus  proposal,3 the  current  4  MHz  B  Block 
guard  band  would  be  eliminated,  with  3  MHz  placed  in  the  public  safety  segment 
and  500  kHz  paired  channels  moved  to  the  A  Block  guard  band,  which  would  be 
relocated  adjacent  to  the  spectrum  added  to  the  public  safety  segment.  This  spec-
trum is from two sources: of the 52 B Block licenses, 42 are held by the Commission 
as  a  result  of  the  800  MHz  reconfiguration,  having  originally  been  licensed  to 
Nextel, with the remaining 10 licenses held by Access Spectrum, Pegasus, and oth-
ers, who seek compensation for relinquishing these licenses. 

A  consensus  among  public  safety  organizations  has  emerged  embracing  the  Ac-
cess/Pegasus  proposal  while  recognizing  its  inherent  limitations.  NPSTC  believes 
this proposal should be adopted, regardless of the licensing structure ultimately cho-
sen for the existing data spectrum because it helps minimize interference to the 700 
MHZ  narrowband  voice  spectrum.  However,  even  with  the  reconfiguration  that  Ac-
cess  Spectrum  and  Pegasus  have  proposed,  the  resulting  spectrum  is  still  far  short 
of  that  needed  for  a  nationwide  broadband  network  and  the  regulatory  structure 
proposed  by  the  Commission  would  not  support  deployment  of  such  a  network.  As 
noted  above,  local  officials  need  the  discretion  afforded  by  the  regional  planning 
process to use the current 700 MHZ data segment for either broadband or wideband 
operations,  as  addressed  in  responses  to  the  previous  Eighth  NPRM.  It  preserves 
for local officials, whose governments must assume associated capital and operating 
costs,  the  decision  whether  to  pursue  a  more  resource-demanding  broadband  net-
work  or  more  cost  efficient  wideband  network.  The  discretion  is  particularly  impor-
tant to rural agencies facing large coverage and topology challenges where the costs 
for local governments makes implementation of wideband coverage more achievable 
than the advanced services broadband will provide. 

By contrast, any nationwide broadband network, of necessity, must be uniform in 
design  and  deployment.  It  must  be  available  to  all  agencies;  otherwise  it  will  not 
unify  public  safety  but  further  divide  it.  For  this  reason,  it  must  be  in  addition  to, 
not  a  replacement  for,  the  systems  that  will  be  deployed  on  the  current  700  MHZ 
wideband segment, as enhanced by the Access Spectrum/Pegasus proposal. 

It is in this context that NPSTC, and the public safety community, has embraced 
the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  (PSBT)  proposal.4 The  PSBT  proposes  that  30 
MHZ of the yet-to-be auctioned spectrum in the upper 700 MHZ band be committed 
to public safety communications for a nationwide interoperable broadband network. 
A trust, organized, populated and controlled by the public safety community, would 
be  established  to  administer  these  channels  and  develop  funding  sources  to  build 
and  maintain  the  network.  To  that  end,  private  entities  would  lease  access  to  the 
spectrum from the trust in a shared government/commercial environment; the leas-
ing  revenue  would  fund  building,  maintaining  and  upgrading  the  network  and  also 
repay monies borrowed against Federal loan guarantees to compensate the Treasury 
for  foregone  auction  revenue.  The  PSBT  would  establish  the  technical  parameters 
of  the  network  to  ensure  public  safety  standards,  pervasive  interoperability  among 
agencies and open architecture. It presents a governing body embracing public safe-
ty  representation  and  a  management  structure  promoting  public/private  spectrum 
use. 

Critically,  the  PSBT  approach  presents  a  path  toward  a  nationwide  public  safety 
broadband  network  because  it  addresses  the  systemic  under-funding  of  government 
radio  systems  on  an  ongoing  basis.  It  will  be  able  to  do  so,  however,  only  if  there 
is  sufficient  spectrum  to  attract  commercial  interest  to  invest  in  a  shared  govern-
ment/commercial  network.  The  shared  environment  that  would  emerge  provides 
adequate  spectrum  to  protect  all  interests  and  a  funding  base  to  construct  and 
maintain  the  network,  a  forceful  incentive  for  coexistence.  It  is  this  essential  ele-
ment  that  is  absent  in  the  Ninth  NPRM  which  proposes  only  12  MHZ  of  already 
allocated public safety 700 MHZ spectrum for this critical purpose. 

NPSTC recognizes that the PSBT concept will require Congressional approval not 
to  auction  the  30  MHZ  of  the  60  MHZ  of  commercial  700  MHZ  spectrum.  It  will

require  Congressional  enactment  allowing  the  PSBT  to  borrow  monies  to  pay  the 
Treasury the revenues that would have come from auction. While the concept is op-
posed  by  commercial  interests  that  seek  to  purchase  the  spectrum,  the  PSBT  pro-
posal presents the best path to unify public safety services, its premise being to offer 
a new, exciting and achievable path to solving the challenges of future public safety 
communications. 

The  Ninth  NPRM  has  some  of  the  same  characteristics  as  the  PSBT.  However, 
there  are  also  several  important  and  decisive  differences.  Most  critically,  instead  of 
30 MHZ, the nationwide network proposed in the Ninth NPRM would consist of only 
12 MHZ. With a spectrum segment so small, it provides no realistic means to build 
and  maintain  an  advanced  broadband  network.  Its  pay-as-you-go  format  continues 
the  status  quo  in  a  sector  that  is  perennially  under-funded.  Its  Commercial  Mobile 
Radio  Service  (CMRS)  model  approach  ignores  and  would  dangerously  compromise 
the  diversity,  redundancy,  security  and  universal  obligations  of  public  safety  com-
munications.  Its  reliance  on  cognitive  technologies  is  untested  in  any  public  safety 
scenario. 

The  inadequacy  of  spectrum  in  this  proposal  culminates  in  its  most  serious  flaw. 
NPSTC  is  firmly  convinced  that  commercial  interests  will  have  no  incentive  to  in-
vest in the network. NPSTC has made inquiries of private interests regarding com-
mitments  to  invest  and  use  the  spectrum  under  the  circumstances  proposed  by  the 
Ninth NPRM. Responses were negative and premised on the lack of adequate spec-
trum  to  coexist  with  public  safety  given  the  preemptible  status  of  commercial  serv-
ice  on  the  network.  The  use  of  12  MHZ  simply  will  not  provide  even  the  capacity 
to accommodate the enormous expansion of domestic defense and emergency respon-
sibilities of local, state, and Federal Government agencies, much less present viable 
opportunities for shared commercial usage. 

Without  commercial  investment  to  support  the  build-out  and  maintenance  of  the 
network,  the  burden  will  fall  to  state  and  local  governments  under  the  pay-as-you- 
go  format.  Faced  with  ever-increasing  burdens  to  protect  our  homeland  this  is  nei-
ther  realistic  nor  achievable.  Under  the  Ninth  NPRM  concept  no  nationwide  public 
safety  broadband  network  will  ever  be  built.  Deploying  and  maintaining  a  nation-
wide  broadband  network  consistent  with  public  safety  standards,  generating  reve-
nues  to  assure  universal  access,  promoting  public/private  use  and  possessing  the 
ability  to  respond  to  emergent  circumstances  requires  a  focused  and  accountable 
structure that the Ninth NPRM cannot deliver. 
The Opportunity 

NPSTC  believes  that  within  the  PSBT  concept,  the  Access  Spectrum/Pegasus 
guard  band  proposal,  and  the  Ninth  NPRM  is  a  path  to  a  nationwide  public  safety 
broadband  network  that  will  improve  quality  and  coverage  and  unify  public  safety. 
The  path  embraces  universal  access,  sufficient  spectrum  to  ensure  commercial  in-
vestment and participation, capital and operational resources ensuring an enduring 
modern  nationwide  broadband  network  and  a  governance  structure  ensuring  public 
safety community control, emergency response standards and management expertise 
and efficiency. The foundation for the path is the dedication of spectrum that is ade-
quate to support the initiative. 

This  path  requires  action  by  the  Congress,  Administration  and  the  Commission. 
The  public  safety  controlled  PSBT  must  have  the  requisite  statutory  or  regulatory 
authority to assume daily management of the spectrum, finance the deployment and 
pay  the  Treasury  for  the  value  of  spectrum  intended  for  auction,  with  discretion  to 
take such action as necessary to respond to expanded or emergent needs, all subject 
to the Commission’s regulatory authority and to Congressional oversight. 

The  interests  of  all  parties  desiring  access  to  the  700  MHZ  band  can  converge  to 
secure  this  short-lived  opportunity.  Public  safety  can  be  convinced  to  embrace  a 
shared environment if the nationwide broadband network is available to all agencies 
for the full range of uses and environments that agencies encounter daily and if op-
erations  are  protected.  Private  investment  and  commercial  use  will  ensue  where 
adequate  capacity  and  reliability  is  present.  An  accountable  PSBT  can  ensure 
through supervision and incentive, that cognitive radio technology is eventually pos-
sible  in  both  public  and  commercial  environments,  subject  to  appropriate  testing. 
For  the  first,  and  perhaps  last  time  in  our  history,  adequate  spectrum  resources 
combined with concepts the Commission has under consideration make a nationwide 
public safety broadband network possible. 
Summary 

NPSTC  recognizes  the  reality  that  the  expectations  and  economic  value  of  those 
pursuing  the  yet  to  be  auctioned  700  MHZ  band  compete  with  providing  a  nation-
wide public safety broadband network. The Commission’s Ninth NPRM initiated an

examination of how these seemingly competing objectives can be reconciled. NPSTC 
believes  that  the  core  principles  enumerated  above  set  the  proper  course  and  that 
these interests can ultimately converge. 

NPSTC’s  plea  is  that  the  interests  involved  and  the  consideration  by  the  Con-
gress, the Commission and the Administration comprehend another reality. Current 
public  safety  operations  are  complex  and  difficult,  hindered  by  lack  of  resources, 
where  dangerous  delays  and  disruption  lurk.  Congestion  of  public  safety  commu-
nications channels pervades virtually every urban and suburban area. The improve-
ments a nationwide public safety broadband network will afford will make an enor-
mous  difference  to  the  effectiveness  of  deterrence,  response  and  investigation.  The 
greatest and most definitive benefit will accrue to the citizen who desperately needs 
help when confronted with an emergency.

REPLY COMMENTS OF THE NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY TELECOMMUNICATIONS COUNCIL 
The  National  Public  Safety  Telecommunications  Council  (NPSTC)  submits  these 
reply comments addressing the Commission’s Ninth Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
(Ninth NPRM) in these proceedings.1 The Ninth NPRM proposes a centralized inter-
operable public safety national broadband network that will be shared with commer-
cial interests. It proposes to use the 12 MHZ wideband segment currently allocated 
to the public safety service in the 700 MHZ band. 

The  benefit  and  need  for  a  public  safety  broadband  network  is  endorsed  by  cel-
lular  carriers,  equipment  manufacturers,  public  safety  agencies  and  organizations. 
While embracing this essential objective; the comments diverge regarding how to at-
tain  the  goal.  The  divide  centers  on  whether  public  safety  agencies  need  additional 
spectrum.  Cellular  carriers,  pursuing  the  remaining  60  MHZ  of  the  700  MHZ  band 
through  the  auction  process,  oppose  any  additional  allocation;  asserting  that  public 
safety’s current allocation is adequate. 

NPSTC  believes  that  additional  spectrum  is  crucial  to  meeting  public  safety’s  ex-
panded  responsibilities.  It  is  critical  to  the  technical  and  economic  viability  of  the 
Commission’s proposal. The Commission should reject the static position that denies 
the  enormous  expansion  of  domestic  defense  and  emergency  response  responsibil-
ities.  It  should  pursue  a  path  providing  additional  spectrum  for  a  broadband  net-
work capable of delivering improvements paralleling today’s challenge. 
Summary of Comments 

Interests  supporting  the  Ninth  NPRM’s  premise  that  12  MHz  is  sufficient  for  a 
public/private network include cellular carriers, broadband equipment providers and

their  trade  associations.2 Several  oppose  any  additional  spectrum  for  public  safety 
communications.3 These  interests  also  recommend  relocating  current  public  safety 
narrowband voice channels but object to the proposal of guard band licensees to pro-
vide additional channels to public safety.4 

In contrast, public safety agencies and other interests state that 12 MHZ is inad-
equate  to  support  public  safety  operations  and  cannot  additionally  accommodate 
commercial  interests,  reflecting,  as  APCO  indicates,  the  proposal’s  ‘‘fatal’’  flaw.5 
Many  public  safety  comments  emphasized  that  eliminating  the  wideband  channels 
diminishes the options and flexibility afforded to local officials.6 Secondary operation 
by  commercial  interests  on  the  12  MHZ  public  safety  segment  was  strongly  chal-
lenged.7 The  guard  band  licensee  proposal  to  provide  public  safety  additional  chan-
nels  was  endorsed.8 Several  comments  challenged  the  ability  of  the  commercial 
radio  service  (CMRS)  model  to  meet  public  safety  standards  of  universal  coverage, 
redundancy,  diversity  and  reliability.9 Several  parties  noted  that  the  Public  Safety 
Broadband Trust (PSBT), in contrast to the Ninth NPRM, is a viable technical and 
economic proposal.10 

Equipment  manufacturers  Dataradio,  M/A  Com  and  Motorola  discussed  the  im-
portance  of  flexibility  for  local  operations  and  addressed  these  requirements  in  the 
context  of  band  alignment.  Northrop  Grumman  stated  that  the  viability  of  the  pro-
posal  is  so  tenuous  it  would  delay  access  to  the  700  MHZ  band.  Cyren  Call  reiter-
ated its PSBT proposal that would use 30 MHZ of the yet to be auctioned 700 MHZ 
band  for  a  public/private  broadband  network;  Frontline  Wireless  proposed  that  a 
new  E  Block  of  10  MHZ  be  established  from  this  spectrum  to  serve  public  safety 
agencies and carriers. 

NPSTC’s  position  is  more  than  a  simple  plea  for  additional  spectrum  for  public 
safety. It recognizes the technical challenges pervading the band yet the opportuni-
ties  and  efficiencies  presented  by  broadband  technology.  We  have  pursued  policies 
throughout the 700 MHz proceedings that promote not only the coexistence of serv-
ices  but  a  complementary  environment  benefiting  all  interests.  While  our  review  of 
the  comments  is  biased  toward  those  presenting  positive  contributions  to  public 
safety’s  challenges,  an  important  element  is  the  benefits  that  can  accrue  across  all 
users. 
Additional  Spectrum  is  Integral  to  a  Nationwide  Public  Safety  Broadband 

Network 

Assertions  that  public  safety  has  adequate  spectrum  are  insulated  from  the  re-
ality facing the Nation’s emergency services. The cellular deployment experience has 
neither  the  history  nor  the  challenges  and  should  not  serve  as  the  justification  to 
deny  public  safety  additional  spectrum.  No  commercial  carrier  has  channels  spread 
over ten frequency bands that vary widely in propagation characteristics, and often 
needing the use of multiple bands simultaneously at an incident scene. Nor has any 
carrier  faced  an  almost  50  year  history  of  regulatory  direction  to  reduce  channel 
size,  a  direction  counter  to  broadband  delivery.  In  their  comments  for  this  pro-
ceeding,  the  Consumer  Electronics  Association  and  High  Tech  DTV  Coalition  have 
made reference to the Criterion Economics paper released on February 6, 2007 and 
entitled  ‘‘Improving  Public  Safety  Communications:  An  Analysis  of  Alternative  Ap-
proaches.’’  This  paper,  prepared  at  their  expense,  was  developed  to  primarily  sup-
port  their  assertions  that  public  safety  does  not  need  more  spectrum  and  distorts 
facts  concerning  the  history  and  intended  purpose  of  the  24  MHz  of  public  safety 
spectrum  allocated  by  Congress  in  the  Balanced  Budget  Act  of  1997.  We  urge  the 
Commission to review the March 7, 2007 report of Cyren Call Communications enti-

lic  Safety  Communications:  An  Analysis  of  Alternative  Approaches.’’ 11 In  our  view 
this  paper  does  an  excellent  job  of  explaining  the  true  history  of  public  safety  com-
munications and the vast difference of needs between public safety and commercial 
systems. 

Unlike the cellular carriers, public safety agencies face widely varying geographic 
and  population  requirements  where  they  must  provide  service.  Broad  geographic 
areas  must  be  covered  efficiently  for  a  small  number  of  users,  requiring  relatively 
high  power  handsets  or  other  mobile  receivers  as  compared  to  the  cellular  environ-
ment. Public safety cannot tolerate denied access, garbled transmissions or dropped 
calls.  These  values  translate  to  substantially  higher  standards  of  reliability  for  the 
infrastructure  and  equipment.  The  cost  is  not  only  additional  investment,  which  is 
consistently under funded, but often results in diminishing of network capacity. The 
result  is  an  achieved  value  and  not  an  indication  that  public  safety  uses  its  spec-
trum inefficiently. 

Added to this environment is that today’s first responder works in a world trans-
formed by the September 11, 2001 attacks and the recent hurricanes. The 9/11 Com-
mission’s recommendation of additional public safety spectrum was not misinformed 
but  grounded  on  the  enormous  enlargement  of  state  and  local  government  respon-
sibilities.  It  recognized  the  widening  gap  between  the  responsibilities  of  local,  state 
and  Federal  agencies  for  domestic  security,  emergency  preparedness  and  radio  re-
sources. Of the many policy and technical decisions faced by the Commission in this 
proceeding, the amount of spectrum dedicated to public safety is the key to meeting 
these challenges. 

The current structure of the public safety services, including the 700 MHZ public 
safety allocation, provides local governments, who must pay for the networks capital 
and operating costs, wide discretion. This is consistent with the national framework 
committing  the  management  and  financing  of  public  safety  responsibilities  to  local 
government.  Contentions  that  the  CMRS  history  should  be  either  a  model  showing 
inefficient  public  safety  spectrum  use  or  the  path  to  deliver  public  safety  services 
are wrong. Instead, what emerges is a blind allegiance to commercial control of the 
remaining  60  MHZ  of  700  MHZ  and  a  deep  discounting  of  what  this  spectrum  can 
provide to emergency response. 
Failing  to  Provide  Additional  Spectrum  While  Eliminating  Current 
Flexibility  and  Discretion  in  the  700  MHZ  Public  Safety  Segment 
Presents Significant Risks 

Removing the 12 MHZ from its intended use and mandating a broadband network 
will come at significant cost and create substantial risk. It will remove local officials 
with  primary  responsibility  for  public  safety  from  determining  how  radio  resources 
should assist their operations. Comments in support of the Ninth NPRM ignore that 
wideband is appreciably more affordable and effective for many agencies, especially 
in  less  densely  populated  areas.  This  is  particularly  critical  when  the  only  funding 
comes  from  local,  state  and  Federal  taxpayers.  The  comments  also  improperly  dis-
count  the  proposal  of  the  guard  band  licensees  to  increase  flexibility  and  discretion 
to shape communications to respond effectively. 

The importance of the guard band licensee proposal is in what it provides and in 
its  underpinnings.  It  adds  crucial  flexibility  allowing  local  agencies  to  choose  more 
cost efficient wideband channels or the expanded services accompanying broadband. 
Underlying the proposal is an extensive technical analysis demonstrating its ability 
to  protect  against  interference  between  and  among  services  while  promoting  more 
efficient  use  for  public  safety  and  commercial  users.  It  presents  a  fundamental 
premise of how services cannot only coexist but complement one another. 

Significantly, contrary to comments urging only the relocation of the public safety 
narrowband channels to obtain purported adjacent channel compatibility, the guard 
band  licensee  proposal  resolves  challenges  from  Canadian  broadcast  operations  to 
U.S. border agencies. The opposing comments do not, and in failing to do so present 
severe  interference  challenges  to  border  agencies  in  the  use  of  the  700  MHZ 
narrowband voice interoperability channels. 

The  risk  accompanying  simply  redesignating  the  12  MHZ  as  broadband  becomes 
more profound by the uncertainty of private sector participation and investment. Its 
fragile  and  tentative  state  is  starkly  shown  as  not  one  commercial  interest  filed  a 
comment stating that it will use the band or invest in it. Similarly, no comment sup-
porting  the  proposal  addressed  or  refuted  the  several  objections  that  commercial 
broadband  operations,  with  secondary  authority  throughout  the  public  safety  seg-

ment,  present  serious  interference  challenges,  particularly  to  public  safety’s 
narrowband  voice  channels.  Much  diluted  local  discretion,  substantially  increased 
interference  challenges,  and  an  economic  model  that  is  not  viable,  go  in  a  direction 
opposite of the important goal of an interoperable broadband network providing ad-
vanced services to all agencies. 
The Justification for Additional Spectrum 

NPSTC urges the Commission to pursue assisting public safety in efforts to rescue 
spectrum from the yet to be auctioned 700 MHZ. We do not believe a viable network 
can be deployed and used without it. 

The path commences with adopting the guard band licensee proposal to add chan-
nels to the public safety segment. It requires analyzing not only coexistence but how 
infrastructure  and  equipment  across  various  services  can  complement  one  another 
to  the  benefit  of  all.  The  PSBT  proposal  is  at  the  forefront  of  how  to  approach  this 
challenge. The Frontline Wireless proposal should also be given further close exam-
ination. While we are waiting for additional details from the proponents, we believe 
there  are  a  number  of  issues  that,  from  our  perspective,  need  to  be  addressed. 
Under  the  Frontline  proposal,  the  selection  of  the  operator  for  a  nationwide  public 
safety broadband network would not be made by public safety and not by Congress 
or  the  FCC;  rather  it  would  be  a  matter  of  who  puts  the  highest  dollar  number  on 
the  table.  It  seems  to  us  that  a  vitally  important  decision  is  being  left  to  chance. 
Without  regard  to  whether  this  operator  understands  the  unique  requirements  of 
public safety, the operator would be given exclusive rights to share capacity on pub-
lic  safety’s  12  MHZ.  If  the  operator  runs  into  financial  trouble,  public  safety  could 
be sitting across the table bargaining with an operator with the sole objective of re-
covering  the  highest  percentage  of  their  money.  The  Frontline  proposal  seems  to 
permit  the  outcome  that  if  no  agreement  is  reached  after  negotiations  with  public 
safety,  the  E  block  licensee  would  then  have  the  chance  to  build  out  ‘‘commercial 
only’’  facilities  on  whatever  basis  it  chooses,  thus  defeating  the  purpose  of  the  ‘‘set 
aside’’  in  the  first  place.  The  commercial  operator  would  be  the  spectrum  licensee 
of the E block, the system operator, and it would have the exclusive right to access 
the public safety spectrum on a shared basis. This combination would give too much 
negotiating leverage when it bargains with public safety to discuss shared facilities. 
Particularly since it has a great chance of keeping and using the spectrum if no deal 
is  reached,  the  winner  will  have  no  incentive  to  bargain  in  good  faith  with  public 
safety. 

NPSTC  urges  the  Commission  to  cross  the  barrier  so  clearly  delineated  in  the 
comments  and  move  public  safety  and  commercial  interests  to  higher  standards. 
What  is  presented  is  the  opportunity  to  provide  the  spectrum  resources  parallel  to 
the  magnitude  of  responsibility  public  safety  faces  while  preserving  the  opportuni-
ties to commercial interests the band presents. 
Conclusion 

NPSTC  urges  the  Commission  to  address  the  need  to  provide  public  safety  agen-
cies  at  all  levels  of  government  the  additional  spectrum  in  the  700  MHZ  band  re-
quired  for  a  viable  nationwide  broadband  network  that  can  assist  all  agencies.  It 
should  reject  the  myth  of  those  challenging  the  needs  of  public  safety  and  who 
would prefer to keep the value of that spectrum for their own interests.

Question 2. The President’s FY 2008 Budget for the Department of Homeland Se-
curity  proposes  to  reduce  State  and  Local  Preparedness  Grants  by  over  30  percent 
from $2.7 million to $1.9 million and to reduce Firefighter Grant Assistance by over 
50  percent,  from  $662,000  to  $300,000.  Chief  Werner,  could  you  briefly  discuss  the 
impact these cuts would have on state and local first responders? 

Answer.  The  President  is  requesting  $300  million  for  the  Assistance  to  Fire-
fighters Grant Program (commonly known as the ‘‘FIRE Act’’), a 2.4 percent increase 
from the Administration’s proposal last year. The President is also requesting $0 for 
the  Staffing  for  Adequate  Fire  and  Emergency  Response  (SAFER)  Act  grant  pro-
gram. These proposed funding levels represent a significant decrease from the $547 
million  for  FIRE  and  $115  million  for  SAFER  that  Congress  appropriated  for  FY 
2007.

In  addition,  the  President  requested  $250  million  for  grants  through  the  State 
Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP). This request also represents a signifi-
cant decrease from the $525 million appropriated by Congress for FY 2007. 

The IAFC urges Congress to fully fund the FIRE and SAFER Act grant programs. 
According  to  the  U.S.  Fire  Administration’s  report,  ‘‘Four  Years  Later—A  Second 
Needs  Assessment  of  the  U.S.  Fire  Service,’’  there  are  still  major  shortages  in  the 
basic requirements of America’s fire service. For example: 

• An  estimated  42  percent  of  volunteers  serving  in  communities  with  less  than 
2,500  people  serve  in  departments  that  are  involved  in  structural  firefighting 
but have not formally trained all involved firefighters in those duties. 

• An  estimated  36  percent  of  fire  departments  are  involved  in  delivering  emer-
gency  medical  services  (EMS)  but  have  not  provided  formal  training  in  those 
duties to all involved personnel. 

• An estimated 65 percent of fire departments do not have enough portable radios 

to equip all emergency responders on a shift. 

breathing apparatus (SCBA) to equip all firefighters on a shift. 

• An estimated 60 percent of fire departments do not have enough self-contained 
• An estimated half (48 percent) of fire departments do not have enough personal 
alert safety system (PASS) devices to equip all emergency responders on a shift. 
It is important that the FIRE and SAFER grant programs be fully funded to meet 

these basic needs. 

In  addition,  we  have  concerns  about  the  proposal  in  the  President’s  budget  to 
limit the use of FIRE grant funding for training, equipment and personal protective 
gear.  The  President  has  proposed  this  change  in  prior  fiscal  years,  however  each 
time  Congress  made  sure  that  the  funds  could  be  used  for  all  hazards  and  for  all 
types of programs, including wellness and fitness, fire prevention, public education, 
and modifications of facilities for the health and safety of personnel, as the original 
legislation  intended.  We  urge  Congress  to  continue  to  make  sure  that  FIRE  grant 
funding can be used for all of the legislatively-authorized categories. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

CHARLES L. WERNER 

Question 1. Are you aware if manufacturers of P25 compliant radios have any dis-
cretion with respect to conforming to the standard? If so, what features of P25 radio 
are subject to manufacturer’s discretion? 

Answer. To my knowledge, if a radio is to be P25 compliant, there is no discretion 

to conforming to the standard. 

Question  2.  To  the  best  of  your  knowledge,  have  there  been  instances  where  cer-
tain features of P25 compliant radios from one manufacturer were not interoperable 
with P25 compliant equipment from another manufacturer? 

Answer. Not that I am aware but recently, radios that were supposedly P25 com-
pliant  were  found  not  to  be  through  NIST  tests.  It  is  a  complicated  standard  and 
it is even harder for the lay public safety responder to understand and validate. 

Question  3.  Is  there  a  conformance  test  for  P25  radios  that  is  available  today  for 

manufacturers? 

Answer.  I  believe  that  NIST  has  developed  a  test  to  validate  compliance.  I  rec-
ommend  that  you  contact  Mr.  Derek  Orr  at  NIST  regarding  additional  information 
about P25. 

Question 4. Have there been emergency situations you are aware of where a first 
responder  has  stated  a  preference  for  using  analog  radios  instead  of  digital  radios? 
Answer.  Yes,  while  the  digital  radios  offer  many  new  functional  and  safety  fea-
tures  as  well  as  more  efficient  use  of  spectrum,  analog  offers  a  clearer  voice  audio 
during  many  fireground  operations.  Loud  noises  can  create  interference  and  poten-
tially unintelligible audio voice in digital radios. 

Question 5. Do you see a role for analog mutual aid channels in the large scheme 

of achieving interoperable communications? 

Answer.  Many  are  in  operation  today  and  will  be  into  the  foreseeable  future. 
Bridge  technology  is  available  and  in  operation  today  to  connect  disparate  systems 
in a planned mutual aid environment. 

Question 6. Is there a standard for public safety personnel to exchange data? For 
exchanging video? Should any standards developed be open standards? What is the 
danger of not having open standards?

Answer.  There  are  standards  being  developed  (Emergency  Data  Exchange  Lan-
guage—EDXL)  as  part  of  the  Global  Justice  initiative.  They  are  open  standards 
which are crucial to future success and interoperability between devices. 

Question  7.  Many  communities  rely  on  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s 
SAFECOM  guidance  in  guiding  purchase  and  requests  related  to  facilitating  inter-
operable  communications.  Do  you  believe  that  historically  DHS  has  focused  too 
much  on  hardware  solution?  Do  you  believe  that  DHS  guidance  in  the  past  has 
chilled local governments from pursuing IP-based solutions? 

Answer.  SAFECOM  has  developed  a  ‘‘Continuum’’  to  describe  the  route  to  inter-
operability. Technology is only a part of that solution. The first effort, and probably 
the  most  significant,  is  governance.  As  to  IP-based  solutions,  the  technology  at  this 
time  is  not  advanced  sufficiently  to  be  useful  for  voice  mission-critical  public  safety 
wireless  radio  communications.  This  also  includes  the  fact  that  the  wireless  net-
works are not made to the reliability and redundant standards of public safety sys-
tems. However, a wireless network that is designed under the guidance of the Public 
Safety  Broadband  Trust  may  lead  to  a  network  appropriate  for  these  technologies. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG TO 

CHARLES L. WERNER 

Question 1. Can you provide the Committee with an update on the costs and sta-

tus of interoperable systems in the existing public safety spectrum bands? 

Answer. There are approximately 55,000 public safety communications operations 
in  the  United  States.  Each  one  is  different  with  different  operational  requirements 
and at different levels of financial ability. The status of interoperable systems in the 
existing  public  safety  spectrum  bands  is  available  from  SAFECOM  from  a  recently 
completed survey of public safety agencies. 

Question 2. Has the public safety community conducted studies showing the condi-
tion  of  interoperability  nationwide  today,  matching  that  interoperability  to  existing 
spectrum allocations, and how much additional spectrum is needed overall? 

Answer.  The  SAFECOM  Baseline  study  on  interoperability,  recently  completed, 
provides information on status of interoperability today. The Public Safety Wireless 
Advisory Committee Report submitted to the FCC and NTIA on September 11, 1996 
provides  detailed  information  on  how  much  additional  spectrum  is  needed  overall 
for public safety. I referred to this report in my testimony. 

Question 3. The new broadband network that is envisioned would need enough ca-
pacity for both government and commercial use. In any given day, how much capac-
ity  would  need  to  be  dedicated  to  public  safety  vs.  commercial  use?  Would  public 
safety’s capacity needs on this network likely increase as time went by? 

Answer. I think on a daily basis, the demand would be much like that of the com-
mercial  market.  During  a  serious  incident  a  much  higher  demand  would  be  needed 
for the initial time immediately following an incident/event. 

I  think  that  the  increased  use  will  occur  but  such  that  the  technology  and  net-

work will increase but similar to that of the commercial subscriber model. 

Question 4. What are some of the special needs of public safety that are not avail-

able on existing commercial networks? 

Answer.  The  primary  reason  public  safety  does  not  use  voice  on  commercial  net-
works  is  that  commercial  networks  are  generally  not  built  to  the  hardened  status 
that  public  safety  communications  networks  are  and  that  public  safety  priority  for 
its  mission-critical  status  is  not  assured.  Additionally,  the  commercial  network  has 
a  drop  rate  of  2  percent  which  is  much  higher  than  mission  critical  voice  systems 
of public safety. However a new Public Safety Broadband Trust guided network may 
well change that paradigm.

HARLIN R. MCEWEN 

Question  1.  Both  CTIA  and  the  FCC  suggest  that  a  national  broadband  network 
can  be  built  on  12  of  the  24  megahertz  that  public  safety  is  currently  expected  to 
receive  following  the  DTV  transition.  Why  do  you  believe  an  additional  30  mega-
hertz is needed? 

Answer.  First,  it  is  important  to  understand  the  background  of  the  24  MHz  of 

spectrum assigned to public safety in the upper 700 MHz band. 

In 1995, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in concert with the Na-
tional  Telecommunications  and  Information  Administration  (NTIA),  established  the 
Public  Safety  Wireless  Advisory  Committee  (PSWAC)  to  provide  an  assessment  of 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:58 Oct 06, 2010 Jkt 039473 PO 00000 Frm 00092 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39473.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

89 

the communications needs of public safety agencies through the year 2010. On Sep-
tember  11,  1996,  PSWAC  released  a  report  setting  forth  the  current  and  future 
spectrum needs of public safety. Among the findings of the PSWAC report was that 
97.5  MHz  of  new  public  safety  spectrum  was  needed  by  2010,  including  25  MHz 
within 5 years (i.e., by 2001). 

As  a  result  of  the  PSWAC  report,  Congress  directed  the  FCC  (in  the  Balanced 
Budget Act of 1997) to allocate no later than January 1, 1998, 24 MHz of radio spec-
trum between 746 and 806 MHz (to be recovered from television channels 60–69 as 
a  result  of  the  implementation  of  digital  television).  The  FCC  then  reallocated  for 
public  safety  use,  television  channels  63,  64,  68,  and  69.  On  August  6,  1998,  the 
FCC  created  the  Public  Safety  National  Coordinating  Committee  (NCC)  under  the 
authority  of  the  Federal  Advisory  Committee  Act  (FACA).  The  purpose  of  the  NCC 
was  to  recommend  rules  for  the  use  of  the  24  MHz  of  spectrum  in  the  700  MHz 
band. 

The NCC, in its final report in July 2003, recommended that half of the new spec-
trum  (12  MHz)  be  designated  for  urgently  needed  public  safety  narrowband  voice 
channels,  and  that  the  remaining  12  MHz  be  designated  for  wideband  data  chan-
nels.  Since  then,  significant  advances  in  technology  have  made  it  desirable  to  add 
the option of using broadband data channels. To accommodate this there are several 
new plans currently under study by the FCC. 

A  proposal  known  as  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  has  been  made  to  allo-
cate  30  MHz  of  additional  spectrum  for  public  safety  (from  C  and  D  blocks)  to  be 
assigned  to  a  Trust  that  would  be  controlled  by  public  safety  and  would  enter  into 
public/private partnerships to deploy a nationwide broadband public safety network 
that would also be used for commercial broadband communications. 

The current 24 MHz of spectrum already allocated for public safety is not sufficient 

for such a nationwide broadband network because: 

1.  Half  of  the  spectrum  (12  MHz)  is  allocated  for  urgently  needed  narrowband 
voice  and  is  already  licensed  and  being  used  by  public  safety  agencies  in  areas 
where  there  are  no  competing  television  broadcasters.  Many  other  agencies  have 
this  spectrum  in  the  planning  process  and  plan  to  use  it  once  the  television  broad-
casters have vacated the spectrum in February 2009. 

2.  The  wideband  data  channels  are  designated  for  local  and  state  licensing  and 
are being planned for local, regional and state use. As an example, one contract al-
ready has been approved for a three-county wideband system in Minnesota.

3. The 12 MHz of spectrum designated for data channels is not sufficient in capac-
ity  to  support  both  public  safety  and  commercial  services  such  as  proposed  for  the 
Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  (PSBT).  There  must  be  sufficient  spectrum  for  com-
mercial investors to be able to offer reliable commercial services that would not reg-
ularly be disrupted by public safety pre-emption. Without commercial investors pub-
lic safety has no funding mechanism to build a nationwide broadband network. 

Question  1a.  What  effect  would  an  additional  allocation  have  on  the  use  of  other 

public safety bands? 

Answer.  Most  of  the  existing  public  safety  allocations  below  512  MHz  are  highly 
fragmented  on  very  narrow  channels  that  are  interleaved  with  users  such  as  con-
struction  companies,  taxicab  fleets  and  tow  truck  operators.  While  entirely  unsuit-
able  for  broadband  applications,  they  were  designed  to  and  do  meet  a  wide  variety 
of mission-critical public safety voice communications requirements that are integral 
to  the  ongoing  responsibilities  of  public  safety  officials.  The  nationwide  advanced 
technology  interoperable  broadband  network  under  consideration  is  not  expected  to 
replace  these  legacy  voice  systems,  at  least  for  the  foreseeable  future,  in  part  be-
cause  IP-based  voice  facilities  need  more  testing  and  performance  improvement 
(particularly  in  the  area  of  latency)  before  they  will  be  deemed  to  satisfy  the  rig-
orous reliability requirements of emergency response providers. As individual public 
safety  entities  elect  to  migrate  more  of  their  traffic  to  the  proposed  broadband  net-
work,  it  is  not  unreasonable  to  expect  that  some  of  the  narrowband  voice  channels 
could  be  abandoned  and  returned  to  the  Commission.  However,  this  is  all  based 
upon an assumed build-out of a nationwide broadband network such as proposed in 
the Public Safety Broadband Trust. 

Question 2. The President’s FY 2008 budget for the Department of Homeland Se-
curity  proposes  to  reduce  State  and  Local  Preparedness  Grants  by  over  30  percent 
from $2.7 million to $1.9 million and to reduce Firefighter Grant Assistance by over 
50  percent,  from  $662,000  to  $300,000.  Mr.  McEwen,  could  you  briefly  discuss  the 
impact these cuts would have on state and local first responders? 

Answer.  The  states  and  localities  are  depending  on  the  DHS  grant  programs  to 
assist  with  improving  operable  as  well  as  interoperable  public  safety  communica-
tions systems. Unfortunately many of today’s public safety systems are older analog 
systems  that  are  close  to  the  end  of  their  useful  lifecycles.  These  communications 
systems are inadequate to handle the tremendous demands that are made of public 
safety  in  their  everyday  duties  as  well  as  disastrous  or  catastrophic  events  such  as 
a terrorist attack or a major natural disaster. These inadequacies are not remedied 
by  software  solutions  that  simply  connect  incompatible  networks  together.  The 
budget cuts that were proposed will delay upgrading systems and will put both first 
responders  and  the  citizenry  at  additional  risk.  There  is  general  agreement  that 
bringing all the Nation’s public safety systems into the 21st century must be a pri-
ority  and  that  it  will  take  time  under  the  best  of  circumstances.  Given  this  fact,  I 
regret the cuts to the DHS grant programs. The justification offered for the cuts has 
been unpersuasive. 

First, the interoperability funds in the NTIA Public Safety Interoperable Commu-
nications (PSIC) Grant Program were intended to accelerate the use of the new 700 
MHz  frequencies.  By  reducing  other  DHS  programs  to  offset  the  NTIA  funding  it 
leaves  public  safety  with  no  net  gain.  It  is  robbing  Peter  to  pay  Paul.  Finally,  to 
claim  that  there  is  unused  funding  in  the  pipeline  is  misleading.  Virtually  all  that 
funding is allocated to projects underway but not completed. Congress should recog-
nize that when it appropriates funding for public systems there will be a time period 
during which the systems are planned, procured and installed. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

HARLIN R. MCEWEN 

Question 1. Are you aware if manufacturers of P25 compliant radios have any dis-
cretion with respect to conforming to the standard? If so, what features of P25 radio 
are subject to manufacturer’s discretion? 

Answer.  The  P25  Standard  contains  mandatory  core  elements  that  assure  inter-
operability  but  also  allows  for  manufacturer  unique  features  to  encourage  innova-
tion  and  the  development  of  new  applications  while  maintaining  interoperability 
with  other  P25  radios.  P25  radios  are  tested  for  compliance  at  a  feature  level.  All 
P25  radios  need  not  be  capable  of  all  the  features  defined  by  the  P25  standard. 
There  are  core  features  that  must  be  included  to  enable  interoperability  in  the 
standard P25 mode. There are other features that are ‘‘optional’’ but must meet the 
standard  if  included.  Finally,  P25  allows  for  the  inclusion  of  other  features  that 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:58 Oct 06, 2010 Jkt 039473 PO 00000 Frm 00094 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39473.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

have  not  been  standardized,  but  no  features  that  are  not  standard  can  impede  the 
intended interoperability functionality. 

91 

Question  2.  To  the  best  of  your  knowledge,  have  there  been  instances  where  cer-
tain features of P25 compliant radios from one manufacturer were not interoperable 
with P25 compliant equipment from another manufacturer? 

Answer.  The  P25  standard  is  a  very  lengthy  and  complex  set  of  documents  and 
over  time  it  has  become  apparent  that  different  manufacturers  in  good  faith  have 
interpreted certain specific details differently. 

There are over 100 localities and 15 states that are operating P25 systems. Many 
agencies have successfully tested and certified radios on their systems from competi-
tive  manufacturers.  Among  the  jurisdictions  currently  using  multiple  vendor  radios 
are  the  States  of  Alaska,  Arkansas,  and  Colorado,  as  well  as  the  City  of  Phoenix. 
The  national  public  safety  organizations  are  working  with  the  National  Institute 
of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST),  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS) 
SAFECOM Program, the Project 25 Steering Committee and the manufacturers rep-
resented  by  the  Telecommunications  Industry  Association  (TIA)  to  address  the 
known issues and are in the process of developing new testing and certification pro-
cedures to address these issues. 

Question  3.  Is  there  a  conformance  test  for  P25  radios  that  is  available  today  for 

manufacturers? 

Answer. A conformance test process was begun in April 2005, and we are hopeful 
that  it  will  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2007.  NIST,  with  the  support  of  SAFECOM 
and the P25 Steering Committee, is developing a comprehensive P25 Conformity As-
sessment  Program.  Although  a  number  of  the  conformance  testing  procedures  are 
complete,  there  are  a  number  of  ‘‘key  interfaces’’  that  collectively  comprise  the  P25 
standard,  and  not  all  interfaces  have  received  complete  and  uniformly  agreed  tech-
nical  definitions,  nor  have  all  of  the  identified  test  protocols  been  fully  developed. 
Aspects of the P25 standard unfortunately are highly technical in nature, and the 
processes of standards development and definition and of the formulation and appli-
cation  of  testing  protocols  are  not  easily  condensed  into  concise,  easy  to  commu-
nicate summary form. The topics addressed in the prior answers are treated in more 
detail  in  a  number  of  documents  available  on  the  Internet  that  may  be  helpful  to 
you,  Senator  Cantwell,  and  others  on  the  Committee  who  may  desire  additional 
background  information  on  these  topics.  The  Commonwealth  of  Virginia  (through 
the efforts of its State Interoperability Executive Committee) provides a good, sum-
mary (yet fairly detailed) overview of the P25 standard, its relevance to public safety 
communications, and a status summary of conformance testing and validation, along 
with  links  to  more  formal,  technical  documents,  all  of  which  can  be  accessed  at 
http://www.interoperability.virginia.gov/P25.html. 

Question 4. Have there been emergency situations you are aware of where a first 
responder  has  stated  a  preference  for  using  analog  radios  instead  of  digital  radios? 
Answer.  While  digital  systems  generally  offer  better  performance  over  a  broader 
range of conditions, much greater flexibility, and more efficiency than analog, some 
public  safety  organizations,  particularly  fire  fighters,  have  continued  to  prefer  ana-
log. Many smaller agencies are still using analog systems and are not able to afford 
replacing them. Clearly the future of communications will be dependent upon digital 
systems and the public safety community has been working to make sure that new 
digital systems meet their mission-critical needs. 

Question 5. Do you see a role for analog mutual aid channels in the large scheme 

of achieving interoperable communications? 

Answer. Yes. Public safety has a significant investment in analog mutual aid com-
munications. They are useful not only from an asset perspective but also from a Mu-
tual  Aid/Incident  Command  System  perspective.  A  Mutual  Aid  response  is  built  on 
communications  interoperability  and  written  agreements  that  pre-determined  re-
sources (human and equipment) respond to numerous scenarios. 

Also,  some  analog  mutual  aid  channels  have  been  ‘‘harmonized’’  across  national 
borders with Canada and Mexico. Current FCC rules require 800 MHz NPSPAC ra-
dios  be  capable  of  analog  mutual  aid  operation  on  five  specific  800  MHz  channels. 
Analog  mutual  aid  channels  have  also  been  identified  in  VHF  and  UHF  bands. 
The FCC has also designated interoperability (Mutual Aid) channels in the 700 MHz 
band that operate in the digital P25 mode. 

Question 6. Is there a standard for public safety personnel to exchange data? For 
exchanging video? Should any standards developed be open standards? What is the 
danger of not having open standards? 

Answer.  There  are  no  specific  standards  for  public  safety  data  exchange  today. 
Public safety would prefer to use open standards wherever possible. Certainly, data 
exchange  standards  are  important.  Examples  of  this  in  today’s  environment  are  e-

mail  and  instant  messaging.  These  examples  show  that  while  the  applications  can 
be different and perhaps proprietary, it is possible to develop information exchange 
standards  so  that  different  end-user  applications  interface  in  an  effective  manner. 
Question  7.  Many  communities  rely  on  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s 
SAFECOM  guidance  in  guiding  purchase  and  requests  related  to  facilitating  inter-
operable  communications.  Do  you  believe  that  historically  DHS  has  focused  too 
much  on  hardware  solution?  Do  you  believe  that  DHS  guidance  in  the  past  has 
chilled local governments from pursuing IP-based solutions? 

Answer.  I  support  the  current  SAFECOM  guidance  and  the  preference  it  shows 
for  open  standards.  Open  standards  are  the  key  to  accomplishing  true  interoper-
ability.  For  these  reasons,  I  believe  that  the  current  DHS  guidance  is  appropriate 
as  it  allows  for  flexibility  for  state  and  local  first  responders  to  choose  the  tech-
nology solutions that best address their needs. 

The  P25  standard  has  been  critical  in  facilitating  interoperability  between  sys-
tems from different vendors and injecting competition into the handset marketplace. 
Regardless  of  whether  we  are  discussing  hardware  or  software,  open  standards  are 
crucial,  and  their  necessity  is  affirmed  in  the  SAFECOM  guidance.  There  is  a  role 
for IP but there is work to be done to make it totally acceptable for mission-critical 
use. 

For example, a January 13, 2007, National Security Telecommunications Advisory 
Committee (NSTAC) Report to the President stated the following regarding IP-based 
solutions: 

‘‘Today’s  various  IP  gateways  do  not  interoperate  in  part  because  of  conflicting 
VoIP protocols. Furthermore, they often support only a basic audio patch to the 
different access networks; to improve end-to-end services and achieve interoper-
ability  between  these  IP  gateways,  it  will  be  necessary  to  drive  the  adoption  of 
interoperable  protocols  for  transporting  emergency  communications  services 
across IP networks.’’ 

Another example goes into more detail. On August 22, 2006, I attended a meeting 
hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Office of Law 
Enforcement  Standards  (OLES),  in  conjunction  with  DHS  SAFECOM.  Also  in  at-
tendance  were  key  stakeholders  from  various  Federal  agencies  and  states,  as  well 
as  a  number  of  public  safety  vendors,  including  M/A-COM,  Motorola,  Cisco,  and 
Twisted Pair. We were brought together to discuss the role of IP-based solutions for 
public safety. While the public safety participants discussed the attractiveness of the 
cost of IP-based systems, we identified limitations such as: 

• A lack of standards profiles 
• Security related to: 

» Privacy and integrity of messages 
» Authentication and authorization of users 

• Reliability 

» Concerns about IP in mission-critical situations 

At the end of the session, the entire group reached the following conclusions about 

the limitations of IP-based solutions: 

• ‘‘You can’t just dump VoIP into an existing network and expect it to work.’’ 
• Most  public  safety  agencies  do  not  often  have  the  staff  or  funding  to  continu-
• IP doesn’t automatically mean interoperability. 
• Government  officials  need  further  education  on  the  relationship  between  the 

ously upgrade and manage their systems to meet the requirements. 

strengths and limits of VoIP: 
» Just  because  this  area  involves  Internet  Protocol  does  not  mean  it  is  using 

the Internet. 

» VoIP is part of some LMR solutions. 

• Radio-to-radio in the absence of infrastructure is critical to public safety: 

» Everything is secondary to voice. 

• IT and IP product and applications life cycles tend to be much shorter than pub-

lic safety funding cycles for communication systems. 

For  these  reasons,  I  believe  that  the  current  DHS  guidance  is  appropriate  and 
Congress  should  let  the  public  safety  community,  working  with  SAFECOM,  deter-
mine whether the guidance needs to be revised.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG TO 

HARLIN R. MCEWEN 

93 

Question 1. Can you provide the Committee with an update on the costs and sta-

tus of interoperable systems in the existing public safety spectrum bands? 

Answer.  The  recent  Baseline  Survey  conducted  by  the  DHS  SAFECOM  Program 
gives  some  indication  of  the  status  and  progress  of  interoperability  in  public  safety 
communications.  The  results  can  be  found  at  http://www.safecomprogram.gov/ 
SAFECOM/baseline/. 

Question 2. Has the public safety community conducted studies showing the condi-
tion  of  interoperability  nationwide  today,  matching  that  interoperability  to  existing 
spectrum allocations, and how much additional spectrum is needed overall? 

Answer. No. The public safety community does not have the funding or resources 

to do such a study. 

Question 3. The new broadband network that is envisioned would need enough ca-
pacity for both government and commercial use. In any given day, how much capac-
ity  would  need  to  be  dedicated  to  public  safety  vs.  commercial  use?  Would  public 
safety’s capacity needs on this network likely increase as time went by? 

Answer.  That  is  difficult  for  me  to  answer,  given  the  varied  daily  needs  of  public 
safety.  Cyren  Call  Communications  has  developed  a  white  paper  entitled  Public 
Safety  Broadband  Capacity  Analysis  that  may  be  helpful  to  understanding  the  an-
swer.  I  have  attached  a  copy  for  your  reference.  See  Supplemental  Attachment  on 
page 86. 

Yes,  it  is  envisioned  that  public  safety’s  capacity  needs  on  this  network  would 

likely increase as time went by. 

Question 4. What are some of the special needs of public safety that are not avail-

able on existing commercial networks? 

Answer.  Public  safety  needs  are  measurably  different  from  the  needs  of  commer-
cial  users.  A  dropped  call  on  a  commercial  network  is  inconvenient,  however,  on  a 
public  safety  network,  it  can  mean  life  or  death.  Public  safety  networks  must  oper-
ate  at  near  100  percent  reliability  24/7.  Public  safety  radios  must  work  every  time 
in mission-critical situations. 

For this reason, public safety spectrum cannot be compared to commercial use in 
that  a  public  safety  network  must  be  able  accommodate  peak  traffic  flows,  without 
failing  or  delay,  during  an  emergency.  A  public  safety  officer  can  never  hear,  ‘‘all 
systems busy, please try your call again later.’’ Public safety networks are designed 
to accommodate peak usage demand during major emergencies. Peak demand at an 
incident  can  require  3–10  times  the  number  of  resources  required  on  an  average 
day. 

The  communications  needs  of  public  safety  are  also  dramatically  different  from  a 
commercial  user.  Public  safety  officers  must  be  able  to  connect  to  the  network,  as 
well as directly to each other. This usage pattern for public safety radios is referred 
to  as  ‘‘talk  around.’’  This  is  where  the  officers  communicate  radio-to-radio  without 
going through a network. This can be critical at times when many officers converge 
on an incident. 

Public  safety  also  requires  near  ubiquitous  network  coverage.  Public  safety  users 
must  communicate  throughout  their  jurisdictions,  including  the  most  rural  areas 
and require 95 percent or more geographic coverage. There is not currently a single 
commercial service in the United States that can provide that level of coverage. 

Further,  police  radios  are  ‘‘in-use’’  at  levels  that  far  exceed  the  average  commer-
cial user. In the course of the day, a police radio is often in a monitor mode, listen-
ing  to  calls  to  other  officers  to  see  if  they  need  assistance.  As  many  as  50  officers 
can be monitoring a single channel at the same time. A typical police officer’s radio 
in  the  monitor  mode  is  equivalent  to  a  long  conference  call  with  50  to  70+  people 
listening.  Typically  public  safety  is  in  this  mode  30–50  percent  of  the  time.  This  is 
equivalent  to  over  4,000  ‘‘cell  phone’’  minutes  per  officer  per  month,  which  is  10 
times the ‘‘typical’’ usage. 

When we compare the cost of public safety systems to commercial cellular systems 
we  must  take  into  account  the  fact  that  public  safety  radios  are  used  24  hours  a 
day,  7  days  a  week  for  an  average  of  7  years  before  replacement.  The  average  life 
of a cell phone is significantly shorter. 

Public  Safety  needs  a  hardened  network  with  infrastructure  built  to  withstand 
local  natural  hazards  (tornadoes,  hurricanes,  earthquakes,  floods,  etc.)  that  would 
include  hardened  towers  and  backup  power  with  fuel  supplies  to  withstand  long 
term  outages  of  public  power  sources.  For  the  most  part,  commercial  networks  do 
not offer that level of service or reliability.

PUBLIC SAFETY BROADBAND CAPACITY ANALYSIS 

Introduction 

The future of telecommunications is moving toward the ubiquitous carriage of in-
formation  via  IP-based  telecommunications  systems.  Wireless  services  are  part  of 
this  evolution  as  all  voice,  data,  and  video  will  soon  be  sent  and  received  via  IP 
based radio access that is an integral portion of this future all IP network environ-
ment. 

To  fully  understand  the  radio  spectrum  requirements  of  this  future  network, 
Cyren  Call  performed  an  analysis  of  the  capacities  a  public  safety-grade  wide  area 
wireless  broadband  network  will  have  to  support  to  ensure  that  public  safety  can 
leverage  and  utilize  the  advanced  capabilities  required  to  meet  its  mission  of  pro-
viding protection and safety for the citizens of the United States. 
Background 

Public  Safety  has  recognized  that  the  specific  spectrum  allotments  that  will  sup-
port  wireless  broadband  technology  for  its  needs  must  be  identified  and  set  aside 
now  to  ensure  that  it  is  available  for  the  future.  It  is  generally  agreed  by  the  Con-
gress of the United States, FCC, NTIA, commercial industry, and the scientific com-
munity  that  spectrum  is  a  finite  resource.  To  ensure  the  many  competing  interests 
for this resource have sufficient allocations for their specific requirements, Congress 
and the FCC agree that each need be weighed against the benefits a specific alloca-
tion can provide for overall common good of the United States. 

To  this  end  a  determination  of  what  is  sufficient  spectrum  for  a  given  entity  or 
services  provider  becomes  an  exercise  of  peering  into  the  future  and  using  the  best 
available  information  to  assess  what  impacts  technology  change  will  have  on  its 
needs. 

What  is  known  is  that  as  wireless  services  have  evolved  to  incorporate  services 
beyond  basic  voice,  spectrum  with  increasingly  larger  channel  sizes  are  required  to 
deliver  advanced  capabilities  and  provide  the  level  of  performance  demanded  by 
these services. This has caused a competition for spectrum to arise with many enti-
ties vying for its share of the spectrum pool. 

Public safety is no exception, it is in competition with the wireless commercial op-
erators  for  spectrum  to  support  its  mission.  This  has  raised  the  debate  not  only  as 
to  how  much  spectrum  public  safety  will  require  to  implement  broadband  services 
but in an era of fiscal constraints, how it will be able to sustain and keep evergreen 
the technology base required to have services available now and into the future. 
Scope 

As outlined above there are many facets to the current debate over public safety’s 
broadband  requirements  and  what  will  be  required  to  ensure  these  capabilities  are 
available  for  its  use.  This  analysis  was  undertaken  to  determine  not  only  the  suffi-
ciency  of  current  spectrum  allotments  to  support  wireless  broadband  technologies 
for  public  safety  but  also  what  would  be  required  for  a  public/private  partnership 
that enables public safety to evolve and maintain a desired level of service now and 
into the future. 

This  focus  provides  the  boundaries  for  this  analysis  and  the  underlying  assump-
tions used in the capacity calculations. Two spectrum positions were analyzed to de-
termine  the  requirements  of  public  safety  and  also  a  public/private  partnership. 
These were: 

• 12 MHz—6 MHz by 6 MHz paired 
• 30 MHz—15 MHz by 15 MHz paired 

Assumptions 

In  this  section  the  major  assumptions  used  in  the  analysis  are  outlined.  Specific 
assumptions  that  are  critical  to  the  methodology  of  the  analysis  are  highlighted  in 
context with the use of the assumption. 
General 

This  study  assumed  a  national  network  view.  The  national  network  assumed 
37,000 cell sites required to provide coverage and capacity to meet the requirements 
of the baseline user population, their profiles, and offered services. Due to the scope, 
magnitude, make-up and varying sizes of public safety jurisdictional entities within 
the  U.S.  specific  case  by  case  sample  studies  for  jurisdictions  in  large  dense  urban, 
suburban,  rural,  and  highway  corridor  environments  will  be  the  basis  for  future 
studies  to  assess  individual  jurisdictional  needs.  Incidents/events  of  various  scales

95 

were  a  key  component  of  this  study  to  assess  capacity  and  performance  require-
ments for these types of occurrences. 
Analysis Period 

A  period  of  10  years  was  used  in  this  analysis,  from  2008  to  2018.  By  using  a 
full  10  year  study  period  considerations  such  as  technology  and  applications  evo-
lution and maturity, services adoption, gains in spectral efficiency, convergence and 
concurrent  use  of  services,  and  increasing  demands  for  mobility  could  be  employed 
to assess the demands that would be placed on the network. 
Network Technology 

Today  there  are  three  major  wireless  technologies  considered  to  be  on  migratory 
and evolutionary paths to what is envisioned will be the technology deployed for the 
3G+  or  4th  wide  area  mobile  next-generation  networks  in  the  study  period.  These 
are: 

GSM > UMTS > HSPA > LTE 
WiMax > LTE 
EVDO Rev A/B > LTE 

Long  Term  Evolution  or  LTE  is  a  term  used  to  describe  the  envisioned  technical 
characteristics that will be required for these next-generation wide area mobile net-
works.  This  analysis  blended  and  used  common  technical  stated  evolutionary  char-
acteristics  across  all  three  technology  tracks  such  as  OFDM–MA  and  MIMO,1 flat 
IP core network architectures, mature IMS/SAE services delivery and management, 
VoIP-based  push  to  talk,  and  other  attributes  to  normalize  the  capacity  and  per-
formance assumptions that will be available to provide broadband services. 
Radio Access Layer 

The radio link for a given sector was characterized using the following design as-
sumptions from HSPA+ as this provides a conservative estimate for modeling rather 
than using the stated objectives for 3GPP LTE: 

Channel Size: 5 MHz 
Reuse Factor: 3/1 
Uplink Capacity: 11.5 Mbps 
Downlink Capacity: 28 Mbps 

Broadband Network User Population 

It  is  estimated  that  by  2018  there  will  be  less  than  3  million  public  safety  per-
sonnel  and  that  the  U.S.  population  will  be  300+  million.  A  conservative  and  high 
estimate  of  3  million  public  safety  users  and  32  million  critical  infrastructure  and 
enterprise users was assumed as the user population for this network in 2018. 
Services 

The following table depicts the services that were characterized that would be pro-

vided by the network for this study. 

1 OFDM–MA: Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing—Multiple Access, MIMO: Multiple 

Input/Multiple Output.

Services Note 

It  was  assumed  that  all  services  have  a  failure  point  based  on  excessive  delay. 

For example: 

• It  may  be  acceptable  to  wait  a  minute  for  a  file  transfer,  but  it  may  not  be  ac-

ceptable for that file transfer to take 30 minutes. 

• Service  throughput  is  determined  by  the  most  demanding  aspect  of  the  service 

which is generally session initiation and set-up. 

• Utilizing  strict  average  throughput  would  underestimate  usage  especially  with 

concurrent sessions (voice with video). 

Methodology 

The  high  level  methodology  used  to  determine  the  number  of  subscribers  sup-

ported for various spectrum positions was as follows: 

• Characterize the Services 
• Define Subscriber Types 
• Assign Service Usage to Subscriber Types 
• Determine the Available Throughput 
• Capacity Calculations 

» Public Safety 
» Critical Infrastructure 
» Commercial 

Each step is further explained in the subsequent sections. 

Characterize the Individual Services 

For  the  purposes  of  this  analysis  it  was  assumed  that  subscribers  would  utilize 
services in three broad categories, namely: Real Time Services, Best Effort Services, 
and  Streaming  Services.  Within  each  category,  specific  services  were  assigned,  as 
follows: 

Real Time Services 
Push-to-Talk (PTT) 
Telephony (Voice) 
Monitoring—ability to listen to ongoing group communications 
Alerting—ability to alert other users that communication is desired 
Best Effort Services 
File Transfer—Transfer of large files to or from some data repository 
Messaging—Ability to send multi-media messages to one or more users 
Location—Transmission  to  or  from  the  network  containing  information  about 
the physical location of the user 
Sensor-based data 
Streaming Services 
Streaming Video—The ability to transmit or receive continuous video 

Define Subscriber Types 

The  following  user  profiles  were  developed  and  incorporated  as  the  subscriber 

types for this study: 

Public Safety: Blended profiles for police, fire, and EMS personnel 
Critical Infrastructure: Medical, Energy/Power, Water, Food, Transportation 
Enterprise: Large enterprise [business] entities 

Assign Service Usage to Subscriber Types 
Independent Service Usage 

For  each  subscriber  type,  a  service  profile  was  assigned  that  specified  how  much 
of  each  service  that  subscriber  type  would  utilize  on  average.  It  was  assumed  for 
this analysis that public safety would not be using this service for its primary voice 
system,  and  would  instead  rely  on  it  for  mission-critical  and  routine  broadband  ap-
plications.  Critical  infrastructure  and  commercial  users  would  use  the  system  for 
voice,  and  this  was  factored  into  the  model.  Usage  was  assigned  for  uplink  and 
downlink separately.

Aggregate Service Usage 

99 

Once  each  subscriber  type  had  the  individual  service  profiles  assigned,  an  aggre-
gate  service  profile  was  created.  This  aggregate  service  profile  was  used  to  charac-
terize  the  average  network  utilization  of  that  particular  type  of  subscriber  (Public 
Safety, Critical Infrastructure, or Commercial). 

The  specific  usage  assumptions  and  aggregate  service  profile  for  each  subscriber 

type are listed in the appendix. 
Determine Available Throughput 

This  analysis  uses  a  generic,  technology  independent,  throughput  to  determine 
available  capacity.  The  throughput  values  are  correlated  to  available  radio  spec-
trum.  Although  the  available  throughput  is  technology  independent,  the  quan-
titative  initial  estimate  is  based  on  stated  LTE  standards  for  spectrum  positions  of 
30 MHz (paired 15 MHz) and 12 MHz (paired 6 MHz). 
The effect of radio propagation over distance on the effective throughput— 

• As the radio channel deteriorates, the throughput decreases. 
• The radio channel deteriorates as the distance increases from the cell center (a 

function of radius). 

• It  is  assumed  that  the  user  distribution  in  a  cell  site  is  random  (evenly  spread 

out within the area of the cell). 

• The  diagram  below  shows  the  calculations  for  the  average  effective  data  rate 
for  an  omni-directional  cell  divided  into  three  regions:  inner,  middle  and  outer 
rings.  An  ideal  user  distribution  model  would  utilize  a  continuous  distribution 
model,  rather  than  the  discrete  3  section  model  shown  below.  However,  the 
radio  modulation  schemes  do  not  adjust  continuously,  but  rather  discretely  in 
a finite number of steps. It is clear that the average effective throughput is sig-
nificantly less than the peak throughput and this is an initial estimate at quan-
tifying the derated throughput. 

Estimate the impact of other system effects that impact throughput: 
• Packet Loss (radio and otherwise) 
• Retransmissions due to Packet Loss 
• Lower Layer Packetization Efficiencies (Layer 2 Framing, etc.) 
• Computational Delays and Inefficiencies 
• The cumulative effect of these inefficiencies is estimated to reduce the available 

throughput by 20 percent 

Result:  The  effective  available  throughput  for  the  average  user.  Below  are  the 
analysis results for the throughput at 30 MHz. The same process would be used for 
other spectrum positions.

Capacity Calculations 
Sharing Spectrum 

The  system  being  modeled  is  one  with  the  ability  to  prioritize  traffic  and  in  this 
system Public Safety has priority access to all capacity. If Critical Infrastructure or 
Commercial  users  are  utilizing  capacity  that  is  needed  to  serve  Public  Safety,  the 
system  will  throttle  the  capacity  available  to  Critical  Infrastructure  and  Enterprise 
users, and make it available to Public Safety on an immediate, as needed basis. 

Critical Infrastructure users will also have priority. However it is lower than Pub-
lic Safety, but it is higher than commercial users. Thus after Public Safety capacity 
needs are met, Critical Infrastructure users are served. 

Enterprise users utilize the remaining capacity. Note that capacity that has been 
set  aside  to  ensure  Public  Safety  and  Critical  Infrastructure  usage  experiences  less 
blocking but also provides service for the enterprise users. Enterprise users are only 
affected  by  capacity  in  use,  and  would  only  be  blocked  from  having  access  to  addi-
tional  capacity  if  Public  Safety  and  Critical  Infrastructures  are  generating  a  high 
demand on the system. The diagrams below illustrate the concept.

The first diagram shows a hypothetical level of traffic for the three types of users. 
The  second  diagram  is  the  additive  capacity  of  that  usage.  In  this  hypothetical  ex-
ample, there would have been no blocking if the capacity of the system was at least 
25,000  kbps.  It  is  illustrative  to  look  at  the  blocking  effects  as  the  capacity  of  the 
system is constrained. 

* Note  that  even  though  Critical  Infrastructure  is  blocking,  some  commercial  traffic 

can still get through. 

** Note that a substantial amount of Critical Infrastructure traffic still is passed by 
the  network,  and  that  there  may  be  cases  where  some  commercial  traffic  can 
squeeze in as well. None of this traffic impacts the service levels of Public Safe-
ty. 

It  is  clear  from  the  diagram  that  Public  Safety  users  would  benefit  with  an  ex-
tremely  high  availability  system  (from  a  congestion/capacity  stand  point),  and  that 
sizing of the system is dependent more upon the enterprise user base, and to a less-
er extent, critical infrastructure grade of service. 
Per Cell Capacity Calculation 

To  determine  the  number  of  subscribers  supported  for  a  given  throughput,  the 
number  of  concurrent  average  services  for  the  available  capacity  was  calculated. 
Once  the  number  of  concurrent  simultaneous  sessions  is  known,  one  can  apply  sta-
tistical  modeling  with  the  desired  grade  of  service  calculations.  In  this  analysis, 
Erlang B and Poisson distribution modeling was used with various grades of service, 
depending on the subscriber type. The result is the effective number of simultaneous 
sessions (users) that provides the desired grade of service. The average effective load 
or the average subscriber was calculated previously, and the effective number of ses-
sions,  with  effective  load  per  user  can  be  used  to  determine  the  total  number  of 
users that could be supported within a cell. 
Network-Wide Capacity Calculation 

In  order  to  extrapolate  a  per  cell  calculation  to  the  entire  network,  usage  mod-
eling  assumptions  need  to  be  made.  Specifically  the  distribution  of  the  subscribers/ 
users across the cells needs to be taken into account. For this analysis the business 
modeling  assumptions  were  taken  from  the  Cyren  Call  business  model  using  an 
even  distribution  of  users  across  the  network.  The  following  depicts  analysis  of  a 
30 MHz (15 × 15 paired) spectrum position. 
Public Safety Calculation 

The  capacity  to  support  Public  Safety  is  limited  only  by  the  average  available 
throughput of the system. Therefore by using the services and usage levels of a typ-
ical  Public  Safety  subscriber  the  total  number  of  Public  Safety  subscribers  can  be 
determined. 

The table below summarizes the calculation for Public Safety.

From the table one can see that the model predicts that the network with 30 MHz 
could  support  between  nearly  7  million  to  nearly  11  million  Public  Safety  users  for 
varying grades of service (blocking). However, the maximum number of Public Safe-
ty  users  that  would  be  expected  to  be  supported  would  be  3  million.  Note  that,  by 
the nature of giving Public Safety priority, that this network at 30 MHz would pro-
vide essentially Public Safety with non-blocking service. 

Having  calculated  the  Public  Safety  utilization  one  can  then  determine  the 
amount of capacity that is left over for other users. For the purposes of this model, 
it  was  assumed  that  3  million  Public  Safety  users  were  utilizing  the  network,  and 
any remaining capacity unused by them would form the basis of subsequent calcula-
tions. 
Critical Infrastructure Calculation 

For this analysis, it was assumed that Critical Infrastructure would require a bet-
ter grade of service than Commercial users, but that it would not need to be as ro-
bust  as  for  Public  Safety,  and  that  planning  for  1  percent  blocking  was  reasonable. 
To determine the available capacity for Critical Infrastructure, it was first necessary 
to  determine  the  Public  Safety  capacity  requirements  at  1  percent  blocking.  Note 
that this is not the grade of service Public Safety has, but that the amount of capac-
ity  needed  to  maintain  Public  Safety  at  1  percent  blocking  can  not  be  utilized  by 
Critical Infrastructure users. One must account for the fact that unused Public Safe-
ty  capacity  is  available  to  Critical  Infrastructure  users,  and  that  it  is  the  actual 
usage  of  Public  Safety  that  impacts  the  remaining  capacity,  not  the  capacity  set 
aside to maintain high grades of service (as discussed in the Capacity Overview sec-
tion).  For  this  model  it  was  assumed  to  be  a  reasonable  approximation  that  Public 
Safety  capacity  usage  at  1  percent  blocking  would  be  capacity  that  was  unusable 
by Critical Infrastructure. The analysis is summarized in the table below. 

As  shown  in  the  table,  the  analysis  showed  that  nearly  12  million  Critical  Infra-
structure users could be supported in 30 MHz (15 MHz paired). However, the Cyren 
Call  business  analysis  expects  the  Critical  Infrastructure  users  to  number  approxi-
mately 6 million subscribers.

Commercial Calculation 

The  commercial  capacity  is  calculated  in  a  similar  manner.  It  is  assumed  that 
Commercial  users  would  receive  the  nominal  blocking  of  most  other  cellular  sys-
tems, namely 2 percent. Thus the capacity available for Commercial users would be 
that  which  is  left  over  from  Public  Safety  and  Critical  Infrastructure  usage  also  at 
2 percent. The analysis results are below. 

The analysis shows that with 3 million Public Safety users, and 6 million Critical 
Infrastructure  users,  there  is  enough  network  capacity  to  serve  about  26  Million 
commercial  users  at  typical  cellular  service  levels  with  a  30  MHz  (15x15  paired) 
spectrum position. 
Summary of Results 

Using  the  methodology  described  above,  the  following  spectrum  positions  were 
analyzed. It was found that a 12 MHz (6x6) allotment would not care for a 2.9 mil-
lion public safety user base using an even distribution national network model. 

As  was  shown  in  the  more  detailed  overview  of  the  analysis,  a  30  MHz  (15x15) 
would  meet  the  criteria  to  offer  public  safety  grade  prioritized  service  and  still  en-
able  sufficient  capacity  to  be  provided  to  critical  infrastructure  and  enterprise  sub-
scribers.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

MORGAN O’BRIEN 

Question  1.  One  issue  that  continues  to  vex  policymakers  is  the  buildout  of  wire-
less  services  in  rural  areas.  Could  you  discuss  this  issue,  and  how  either  the  pro-
posal  suggested  by  the  FCC  or  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  proposal  would 
address these concerns? 

Answer.  Because  first  responders  must  go  everywhere  problems  and  disasters 
occur, their communications capabilities must precede them. This is why it’s critical 
for  any  nationwide  platform  to  be  ubiquitous  across  the  United  States,  including 
rural locations. The Public Safety Broadband Trust proposal (‘‘Proposal’’) includes a 
terrestrial  cell  site  buildout  deep  into  our  Nation’s  rural  locations—to  cover  areas 
with  a  population  density  as  low  as  5  persons  per  square  mile,  well  beyond  areas 
covered by the commercial carriers. That terrestrial network build would be supple-
mented and supported by a satellite overlay network, both to cover areas where the 
terrestrial  network  would  not  extend  and  to  provide  a  redundant  communications 
capability  should  the  terrestrial  network  become  inoperable.  In  the  process  of  as-
signing  to  commercial  entities  leases  of  usage  rights  to  its  licensed  spectrum,  the 
Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  would  have,  as  one  of  its  core  mandates,  assuring 
that the network is built out and service is provided in the more sparsely populated, 
underserved  areas  of  our  nation,  as  well  as  in  the  more  densely  populated  urban 
market areas. Given the strong overlap and identity of interests between the Public 
Safety  Broadband  Trust  and  rural  residents—the  former  being  committed  to  make 
sure  first  responders  have  state-of-the-art  communications  wherever  they  must  go, 
the  latter  being  anxious  to  obtain  a  bridge  across  the  digital  divide  that  separates 
them  from  the  personal  and  commercial  benefits  carried  by  access  to  modern, 
broadband  communications  services—there  are  real  incentives  and  true  motivation 
to add confidence that the buildout to rural America will happen. No other proposed 
alternative  offers  the  safeguard  of  having  the  license  to  the  spectrum  in  the  hands 
of  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust,  a  non-profit,  non-stock  entity  controlled  by 
public  safety  organizations,  or  the  powerful  combination  and  alignment  of  motiva-
tions and incentives needed to achieve a meaningful rural network buildout. 

Question  2.  Many  opponents  argue  that  failing  to  auction  30  MHz  of  spectrum 
necessarily  results  in  a  spectrum  giveaway.  Mr.  O’Brien,  some  have  criticized  your 
plan as a ‘‘spectrum giveaway’’ that would allow you to personally profit rather than 
compete through an auction. How do you respond to this charge? 

Answer. Despite misinformation to the contrary, it should be emphasized that nei-
ther  Cyren  Call  nor  any  private,  for-profit  entity  will  be  receiving  a  license  to  any 
spectrum  if  the  Proposal  is  implemented.  Rather,  under  that  proposal  the  Public 
Safety Broadband Trust itself would be awarded and would hold the license to this 
30  MHz  of  spectrum  in  the  700  MHz  band.  The  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust— 
a non-profit, non-stock entity controlled by public safety organizations—would have 
the  normal  spectrum  license  rights  granted  to  any  other  FCC  licensee—and,  like 
other  licensees,  would  be  subject  to  FCC  oversight  and,  consistent  with  numerous 
provisions  contained  in  the  draft  legislation  that  public  safety  has  endorsed  and  is 
attempting  to  have  introduced,  to  significant  ongoing  Congressional  supervision. 
The  ‘‘spectrum  giveaway’’  characterization  is  seriously  flawed  on  at  least  two 
grounds.  First,  the  spectrum  license  would  be  awarded  and  held  for  the  principal 
benefit  of  America’s  public  safety  community,  and  licensed  spectrum  that  has  been 
made  available  for  similar  purposes  in  the  past  never  has  been  regarded  as  ‘‘given 
away.’’  Rather,  it  is  provided  for  the  use  of  our  first  responder  personnel  to  enable 
them to have the tools they require to safely and effectively discharge their critically 
important roles—protecting and preserving our lives and our property. For that rea-
son,  and  with  ample  justification,  such  spectrum  licensed  to  and  for  the  benefit  of 
public  safety  cannot  be  regarded  as  a  ‘‘giveaway.’’  Second,  as  the  draft  legislation 
makes  clear,  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  would  pay  (with  money  borrowed 
in  the  capital  markets,  backed  by  government  loan  guarantees)  an  amount  to  the 
Treasury  for  the  award  of  that  spectrum  license,  both  to  compensate  for  the  loss  of 
auction  revenues  attributable  to  that  spectrum  and  to  assure  full  funding  for  the 
purposes enumerated in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (which, when that legisla-
tion  was  adopted,  was  assumed  to  be  supplied  by  700  MHz  spectrum  auction  pro-
ceeds). Cyren Call will not ‘‘profit’’ from the award of a spectrum license to the Pub-
lic  Safety  Broadband  Trust,  or  from  the  payment  made  for  that  spectrum  license. 
The  Proposal  contemplates  that  an  entity  would  be  retained  by  the  Public  Safety 
Broadband  Trust  to  fulfill  important  roles  in  the  public/private  partnership  struc-
ture,  roles  in  which  both  knowledge  and  experience  in  the  commercial  wireless  in-
dustry  and  in  the  world  of  public  safety  communications  should  be  crucial  ingredi-
ents  and  qualifications.  Although  neither  Cyren  Call  nor  any  other  entity  has  an

108 

entitlement or commitment to be awarded any of those roles, Cyren Call intends to 
apply  for  those  roles,  and  expects  that  it  would  need  to  compete  aggressively  with 
other for-profit applicants in an open and fair process—as expressly provided in the 
draft  legislation—to  win  the  award  of  any  or  all  of  those  roles.  To  clarify  further, 
Cyren  Call  proposes  that  neither  it  nor  whoever  else  might  be  chosen  instead  for 
that role would participate in any way as a commercial operator lessee of the spec-
trum.  This  prohibition  is  suggested  to  avoid  any  conflict  of  interest  that  might  de-
velop between what is best for the Public Safety Broadband Trust and the for-profit 
interests of the commercial operator(s). 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

MORGAN O’BRIEN 

Question  1.  My  understanding  is  that  you  propose  to  solve  the  interoperability 
problem by having all public safety organizations eventually migrate over to the 700 
megahertz  spectrum.  Even  if  the  proposal  is  successful,  this  new  network  will  not 
be built out for a decade or more. Does your proposal address the issue of improving 
interoperability of first responders in the near and intermediate term? 

Answer. As catastrophic events of the recent past have shown, there is an imme-
diate  need  to  make  sure  that  public  safety  narrowband  voice  communications  net-
works  are  made  interoperable,  particularly  on  a  regional  basis,  as  soon  as  possible. 
The government must continue to supply the leadership and funding to make voice 
communications  for  first  responders—over  their  existing  legacy  systems  already  in 
place and operating today—truly interoperable. The Public Safety Broadband Trust 
proposal (‘‘Proposal’’) first and foremost addresses problems that relate to the future 
communications  capabilities  that  need  to  be  made  available  to  public  safety  per-
sonnel—and takes a common sense approach in assuring that those capabilities will 
be  provided  in  a  way  that  also  assures  their  interoperability.  As  a  result,  public 
safety  personnel  at  all  levels  of  government—state,  local  and  Federal—will  be  pro-
vided access to a uniform, next-generation, open standard, nationwide platform per-
mitting them to enjoy the highest possible level of communications interoperability. 
As  important  as  interoperability  will  be  in  this  new  setting,  it  is  equally  important 
and  exciting  to  appreciate  that  these  new  communications  capabilities  will  deliver 
to  first  responders  the  large  file  data  and  streaming  video  capabilities  that  they  do 
not  have  today.  Imagine  a  burning  building  on  the  Elliot  Bay  waterfront  in  Se-
attle—firefighters  set  up  video  cameras  from  multiple  angles  and  enter  the  edifice 
with streaming video capabilities on their helmets—and all this information is sent 
back  in  real-time  to  a  team  in  a  command  center,  making  decisions  based  upon  a 
comprehensive  ‘‘situational  awareness.’’  In  addition,  as  burn  victims  are  raced  to 
Harborview Medical Center, effective treatment is performed en route as doctors in 
the  emergency  room  monitor  vital  signs  and  injuries  through  streaming  video  and 
high-speed  wireless  transmission  of  medical  and  diagnostic  test  results.  Now  imag-
ine  that  this  capability  is  replicated  all  across  America.  All  of  this  is  possible,  but 
only  if  a  broadband  network  designed  for  public  safety  is  created,  with  the  proper 
financing stream to support its operation. 

It  is  true  that  construction  of  this  network  will  require—as  every  national  wire-
less  network  before  it  has  required—some  fairly  significant  period  of  time.  Even 
though that network build likely will reach many of our Nation’s largest urban cen-
ters  (and  a  number  of  other  areas)  in  the  first  three  build  years,  the  Proposal  does 
not  contemplate  or  advocate  that  the  ongoing  efforts  to  achieve  interoperability  for 
public  safety’s  existing  legacy  voice  networks  be  abandoned  or  slowed  down.  The 
Proposal  and  the  next-generation  public  safety  network  it  seeks  to  implement  does 
not  involve  the  diversion  of  one  penny  of  the  $1  billion  in  public  safety  interoper-
ability  funding  authorized  by  Congress—in  fact,  the  mechanisms  set  forth  in  the 
draft  legislation  to  provide  payment  to  the  Treasury  for  the  spectrum  license  to  be 
awarded  to  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  were  crafted  specifically  to  assure 
that  the  needed  funding  for  that  and  other  programs  and  uses  would  be  available 
on  the  timetable  and  in  the  amounts  indicated  by  Congress.  Nor  does  the  Proposal 
recommend or even suggest that public safety’s access to its long-promised and long- 
awaited  24  MHz  of  spectrum  in  the  700  MHz  band—especially  the  channels  in-
cluded  in  that  allocation  that  have  been  identified  specifically  for  interoperability 
purposes—be  delayed  1  second  beyond  the  Congressionally-mandated  DTV  transi-
tion  deadline  in  February  2009.  Although  the  committed  interoperability  funding, 
as  well  as  the  additional  spectrum  designated  expressly  for  interoperability  uses, 
will provide significant assistance to the public safety community in achieving inter-
operability on their current legacy voice systems, others (in Congress and elsewhere) 
have  noted  that  this  problem  has  eluded  solution,  although  it  has  been  recognized

and  diagnosed,  and  funding  for  solutions  have  been  provided,  for  at  least  a  decade. 
Aspects  of  the  public  safety  broadband  network  outlined  in  the  Proposal  include 
components—notably  an  IP-based  core  backbone  and  ‘‘interoperability  gateway’’  ac-
cess points to the network—that (as they become available in particular areas) also 
could  make  significant  contributions  to  a  comprehensive  approach  to  solve  public 
safety’s existing legacy voice system interoperability challenges. 

Question 2. Wireless carriers are currently rolling out what is referred to as third 
generation  or  3G  networks.  The  rollout  has  taken  longer  than  originally  thought, 
in  part  for  technical  reasons  and  in  part  for  business  reasons.  My  understanding 
is that the Cyren Call proposal is based on what is referred to as fourth generation 
technology.  I  have  heard  that  the  reason  the  network  requires  the  30  megahertz  is 
for  technical  reasons—to  ensure  the  most  efficient  re-use  of  the  spectrum.  I  have 
heard  that  the  reason  the  network  requires  30  megahertz  is  for  business  reasons. 
Why  does  your  proposal  require  the  30  megahertz  of  bandwidth?  Has  there  been  a 
technical risk assessment performed on the feasibility of rolling out a fourth genera-
tion network nationally? 

Answer.  The  Proposal  includes  the  creation  of  a  public-private  partnership  by 
which  public  safety  controls  the  spectrum  assets  and  collaborates  with  commercial 
entities  (as  lessees  of  usage  rights  to  the  licensed  spectrum)  to  construct  the  net-
work.  In  exchange  for  building  the  network,  these  commercial  entities  will  be  per-
mitted to have shared use of the network and to make the network’s excess capacity 
available  to  the  commercial  customers  that  they  will  serve,  though  public  safety 
users always will have priority access to the network’s capacity, up to and including 
the full capacity of the network if required in times of crisis. This vision for the fu-
ture  of  public  safety  communications  will:  provide  public  safety  with  an  evergreen 
platform  that  will  evolve  with  technology;  create  a  funding  mechanism  so  that  gov-
ernment financial support for the network build is unnecessary; and at last provide 
public safety with the benefits of the scale economies of a commercial wireless busi-
ness  environment,  thereby  lowering  both  their  costs  of  obtaining  wireless  services 
and  the  cost  of  public  safety  communications  equipment.  Using  data  from  current 
wireless  carrier  operations  and  network  usage  and  other  assumptions  that  we  be-
lieve  reasonable  and  consistent  with  publicly  available  data  sources,  our  modeling 
shows that for such a shared public safety/commercial network, 30 MHz of spectrum 
is needed to support not only public safety’s sporadic, critical incident-driven signifi-
cant  network  capacity  needs,  but  also  the  projected  ‘‘ordinary  course’’  communica-
tions needs of the sizable commercial subscriber base that is required to provide the 
bulk  of  the  revenue  to  meet  network  costs  (both  capital  and  operating).  An  insuffi-
cient  amount  of  spectrum—such  as  the  12  MHz  suggested  in  the  FCC’s  December 
2006  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking—will  attract  neither  commercial  network 
builders nor their investors, and so the network will not be built. Also, next genera-
tion technologies require a sufficient amount of spectrum to support the bandwidth- 
intensive capabilities and transmission speeds especially important to first respond-
ers. 

Capacity  calculations  for  a  mobile  radio  network  involve  many  factors  and  result 
in  a  complex  engineering  exercise.  No  single  factor  by  itself  can  be  used  to  deter-
mine what capacity requirements for a network ultimately will result from an engi-
neering  analysis.  This  is  especially  true  for  an  IP-based  4G  mobile  network  design 
that  must  consider  the  variance  of  capacity  needs  for  public  safety  (normal  to  ex-
treme emergency events) coupled with a high-performance commercial service offer-
ing. 

The key elements that factor into these types of analyses are: 
• Offered service performance requirements (throughput, latency, jitter, etc.) 
• Elasticity behavior of IP networks vs. Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) based 
• Services mix used by the subscriber (e.g., voice, video, data, messaging) 
• Subscriber densities per cell site and cell site sector 
• Subscriber peak busy usage (the greatest concentration of users projected to be 
• Blocking  rate  (especially  with  mixed  use  where  public  safety  will  differ  from 
• Frequency re-use factor (trade-offs on a per-site basis for efficiency and perform-
• Extreme emergency usage and capacity requirements

ence  the  results  of  a  4G  mobile  network  capacity  analysis.  Capacity  results  from

this  type  of  analysis  are  translated  into  an  uplink/downlink  Mbps  requirement  per 
cell  site/per  sector.  From  this  calculation  normalization  the  stated  capacity  of  the 
competing technologies is then used to derive a bits per hertz performance capacity 
that the 4G technologies will theoretically deliver. As there are efficiency gains and 
detractors for technology types (e.g., OFDM–MA), these must be factored in as well. 
The end result is that one determines a technology can deliver ‘‘X’’ capacity per MHz 
and  assess  that  capacity  delivery  outcome  against  a  capacity  analysis  that  has  de-
termined a ‘‘Y’’ capacity need. From this information, one derives the overall amount 
of spectrum required for the envisioned design. Cyren Call determined, based on the 
above factors, that 30 MHz was the minimum required for its stated design require-
ments  and  business  model  mixed  subscriber  (public  safety  and  commercial)  use 
cases. 

In  terms  of  risk  and  the  viability  of  deploying  a  next-generation  4G  network, 
Cyren Call has built a detailed plan that takes into account the execution and fund-
ing challenges required to build and operate the network. From a schedule and prof-
itability perspective, it is a viable plan and consistent with the state of the wireless 
industry  today.  4G  is  not  a  radically  new  concept  or  network  but  is  an  evolution 
of the technologies deployed today. 

Question  3.  The  proposal  includes  $10  billion  in  U.S.  Government  loan  guaran-
tees. If it takes longer to build out the network or the commercial operator does not 
sign up enough customers early on to generate the revenues required to service the 
loans, what is the exposure to the U.S. government? In the end, might the U.S. tax-
payer be footing the bill to build out a commercial network? 

Answer. The primary purpose of the government guaranteed borrowing authority 
granted  in  the  draft  legislation  to  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  (‘‘Trust’’)  is 
to  enable  that  organization  to  raise  sufficient  funds  in  the  capital  markets  to  pay 
the Treasury for the award of a license to the 30 MHz of spectrum. So, the Federal 
Government itself (and derivatively, the U.S. taxpayers) will be the initial and larg-
est beneficiary of that borrowing authority. Moreover, the draft legislation expressly 
provides that the license will be pledged as collateral security for the guarantee obli-
gations. It is true that a significant liquidity problem in the future cannot be ruled 
out (for the commercial lessees any more than for the commercial carriers they may 
compete against), which could result in payment defaults on the Trust’s borrowings, 
and  then  in  turn  on  a  call  on  the  guarantees.  Although  those  cannot  be  character-
ized as happy circumstances, at least the spectrum license could be repossessed and 
the  spectrum  could  then  be  made  available  for  other  purposes,  including  to  provide 
purely commercial services, with the funds received from any future auction of a li-
cense  to  this  spectrum  devoted  to  repay  any  payments  made  on  the  government 
guarantees. The certainty associated with such an outcome is traceable to the struc-
ture of the Trust. First, it is a non-profit, non-stock corporation, meaning there are 
no shareholders or others with a claim on any ‘‘residual value’’ that might be argued 
to exist in the licensed spectrum. Second, it is highly unlikely that (following a pay-
ment  default  and  related  call  on  the  guarantees)  the  Trust  would  have  any  signifi-
cant  creditors  other  than  the  issuer  of  the  guarantees—i.e.,  the  government—and 
certainly  would  have  no  other  secured  creditors,  since  the  spectrum  license  will  be 
the Trust’s only asset. Finally, only the Trust would have licensee status—all other 
parties would have only contractual rights—and the Board of the Trust will be origi-
nally  constituted  by,  and  could  be  changed  only  by,  Federal  legislation  (in  contrast 
to  a  for-profit  entity  license  holder—which  would  have  the  ‘‘bundle  of  rights’’  that 
licensee  status  confers  on  it,  and  whose  governing  body  would  be  selected  by  its 
shareholders—and  possibly  by  other  groups,  e.g.,  holders  of  hybrid  debt/equity  in-
struments and even true creditors, who may have rights to appoint directors or oth-
erwise  be  represented  on  the  governing  body  of  an  entity  if  the  entity  defaults  on 
amounts  owed  to  those  groups).  In  short,  in  contrast  to  the  very  complex  and  con-
flicting collection of interests that bubble to the surface in a liquidity crisis (or even 
an  insolvency  scenario—the  example  in  this  vein  being  presented  by  the  NextWave 
debacle), the cast of relevant characters here would be far more limited and predict-
able,  thereby  realistically  shortening  the  time  (and  increasing  the  assurance  of  the 
relation) between the occurrence of the undesired circumstances and the implemen-
tation of the desired consequences. 

It is also important to note that the government loan guarantees would cover only 
money  borrowed  by  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust.  The  commercial  lessees 
would  not  be  entitled  to  make  their  own  government  guaranteed  borrowings,  nor 
would  the  Trust  borrow  money  on  behalf  of  those  commercial  lessees.  In  fact,  it  is 
expressly contemplated in the Proposal that one of the critical obligations to be un-
dertaken  by  a  commercial  lessee  is  the  obligation  to  finance  the  network  build  out 
in  its  leased  area.  To  the  extent  that  the  Trust  would  borrow  money  not  related  to 
the  acquisition  of  its  spectrum  license,  those  borrowings  first  would  need  to  be  ap-

proved  by  the  Trust’s  Board,  and  then  would  need  to  be  for  purposes  approved  in 
the  draft  legislation,  which  could  include  the  funding  of  research  and  development 
activities  for  products  or  services  expressly  for  the  public  safety  users  of  the  net-
work,  for  providing  financial  assistance  to  enable  more  widespread  use  of  the  net-
work  by  public  safety  users  (e.g.,  to  provide  subsidies  or  financial  assistance  to  law 
enforcement, fire service or emergency medical services personnel in areas that may 
not have the resources to make such payments themselves—such as reservations or 
economically depressed areas), to pay (in whole or in part) to extend terrestrial net-
work  coverage  to  areas  not  assigned  to  any  commercial  lessee,  and  (less  signifi-
cantly)  for  the  Trust’s  own  operating  expenses.  Moreover,  as  the  borrowing  author-
ity sought in the draft legislation extends until December 31, 2020, there is no rea-
son  to  think  that  all  borrowing  would  occur  in  the  early  years,  or  that  most  of  the 
non-spectrum license related borrowing would occur before views as to the network’s 
viability could be based on a significant period of actual network operations. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG TO 

MORGAN O’BRIEN 

Question  1.  You  have  noted  that  commercial  wireless  broadband  networks  do  not 
meet  public  safety’s  needs  today.  What  needs  does  public  safety  have  that  are  not 
met  with  current  commercial  networks,  and  what  assurance  is  there  that  the  new 
network would meet these needs? 

Answer.  Public  safety’s  communications  needs  are  many  and  as  a  nation  we  con-
tinue  to  put  life  and  property  at  undue  risk  by  not  addressing  them  comprehen-
sively.  Two  general  matters  are  solved  by  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  pro-
posal  (‘‘Proposal’’).  First,  this  solution  will  put  public  safety  in  control,  nationally, 
of  their  communications  capabilities  and  provide  them  with  a  state-of-the-art  net-
work that can be refreshed over time as new technologies and capabilities are devel-
oped.  This,  for  the  first  time,  puts  public  safety  at  the  head  of  the  table  in  terms 
of  telecommunications  innovation—and  today  that  means  providing  them  with  the 
enhanced communications capabilities—specifically, access to data-intensive applica-
tions, such as remote access to databases, large file transfer and real-time video ap-
plications—that only a next-generation mobile broadband network can deliver. Addi-
tionally, a public/private partnership will create the right combination of incentives 
on  all  sides  to  create  the  kind  of  network  needed  by  public  safety.  Perhaps  most 
importantly, the Proposal will leave public safety in the ultimate position of control, 
as  the  Trust  (which  is  controlled  by  public  safety)  alone  will  hold  the  license  of  the 
spectrum  used  in  the  network,  while  assuring  that  that  network  is  self-funding, 
costing  the  American  taxpayer  nothing  to  construct  and  generating  a  reliable  and 
consistent  ongoing  source  of  revenue  (largely  from  significant  commercial  usage  of 
the network) that eliminates the need for public safety to go to all levels of govern-
ment, hat in hand, each year, first looking for the money to build, and then looking 
for the additional money to support, their communications systems. 

Second, commercial wireless networks cannot and will not meet the needs of first 
responders.  First  responders  need  a  public  safety-grade  system  that  has  the  cov-
erage,  reliability,  redundancy  and  functionality  to  respond  in  emergency  situations 
wherever they might be. Commercial wireless carriers operate their networks as re-
quired to comply with the conditions of their licenses—which frankly do not require 
those  carriers  to  orient  their  activities  very  much  differently  than  they  willingly 
would  do  anyway—and  otherwise  operate  them  to  maximize  their  returns.  So  com-
mercial  wireless  carriers  offer  commercial  service  with  coverage  holes,  with  98  per-
cent  call  completion  rates,  and  with  commercial  grade  construction  standards 
(hours’  long  battery  back-up  power  at  cell  sites,  limited  backhaul  redundancy,  lim-
ited  duplication  of  core  network  elements)  not  necessarily  because  they  could  not 
cure those situations and still make a profit, but because they can make bigger prof-
its by leaving those situations uncured. Since the existing carriers have no incentive 
to  take  actions  that  would  lower  their  returns,  we  think  it  unlikely  that  they  will 
restructure or retrofit their networks to meet public safety’s stringent needs and re-
quirements. So the Proposal was designed to create something that first responders 
don’t  have  today:  a  robust,  hardened,  interoperable  network  that  provides 
broadband  capabilities  that  they  can  depend  on  when  they  need  it  most,  while  still 
leaving  enough  attractive  commercial  potential  to  present  commercial  lessee  appli-
cants with the opportunity to earn an acceptable rate of return. 

Question  2.  How  much  would  it  cost  to  build  a  nationwide  broadband  network 
that  meets  public  safety’s  coverage  and  other  needs,  and  how  much  more  costly 
would  this  be  than  building  a  broadband  network  based  on  current  commercial 
standards?

112 

Answer.  Cyren  Call  estimates  the  cost  to  build  a  public  safety-grade  network 
could  total  approximately  $20  billion  over  10  years.  Cyren  Call  further  estimates 
that about 30 percent of that total (or, using $20 billion as the relevant total figure, 
about  $6  billion)  would  be  attributable  to  meeting  public  safety  needs  in  terms  of 
network redundancy, reliability and enhanced coverage. However, it is important to 
note  that  many  of  these  extra  expenses  also  should  be  regarded  as  drivers  of  addi-
tional  revenues—and  not  just  from  the  public  safety  and  allied  (e.g.,  critical  infra-
structure users) communities—either directly (i.e., if the public safety-grade network 
has coverage in locations where the commercial networks do not, it likely will have 
customers  and  generate  revenues  from  those  areas  that  the  commercial  networks 
do  not)  or  indirectly  (i.e.,  a  network  exhibiting  enhanced  reliability  and  redun-
dancy—more ‘‘up time’’—may encourage users to drive more ‘‘high-value’’ traffic over 
it, such as encrypted communications and other premium applications). 

Question 3. The new broadband network that is envisioned would need enough ca-
pacity  for  both  government  and  commercial  use.  Are  you  confident  that  a  commer-
cial  entity  would  build  the  network,  and  how  much  of  the  network  would  need  to 
be  available  for  commercial  use  to  encourage  a  company  to  build  it?  In  any  given 
day, how much capacity would need to be for public safety vs. commercial use? 

Answer.  A  commercial  entity  would  build  the  network,  under  an  arrangement 
that would provide it with the right economic incentives to do so. Our research and 
discussions  with  investors  indicate  that  there  is  a  genuine  appetite  in  the  market 
to  fund  the  public  safety  broadband  network.  We  believe  that,  in  addition  to  the 
public  safety  user  base  for  which  it  intentionally  would  be  designed,  the  network 
also would be attractive to a significant customer base composed of users in the crit-
ical  infrastructure  industries,  as  well  as  to  a  large  number  of  high-end  commercial 
customers  that  would  be  attracted  to  the  network  not  only  for  its  ubiquitous  cov-
erage features but also for the security, reliability and other benefits of a hardened 
communications  network.  In  order  for  the  business  case  to  work,  however,  30  MHz 
is  needed  to  provide  sufficient  capacity  for  both  public  safety  and  commercial  user 
groups. It is also important to note that the Public Safety Broadband Trust provides 
the  most  efficient  use  of  radio  spectrum  under  these  circumstances,  whereby  suffi-
cient  spectrum  is  available  to  public  safety  when  it  is  needed  in  emergency  situa-
tions  on  a  priority  basis  and  the  balance  is  made  available  for  commercial  use.  On 
any  given  day—assuming  absence  of  a  truly  catastrophic  public  emergency  situa-
tion—the commercial use of the network should be more significant than the public 
safety  use  of  the  network,  and  the  number  of  commercial  users  being  supported  on 
the  network  will  be  far  more  than  the  number  of  public  safety  users.  In  our  mod-
eling exercises, we have projected that the network—at full coverage build in 2018— 
would  generate  sufficient  capacity  to  meet  (simultaneously)  the  communications 
needs  of  a  total  customer  base  of  35  million,  comprised  of  27  million  commercial 
users,  6  million  critical  infrastructure  users  and  2  million  public  safety  users.  Of 
course, when the urgent communications needs of public safety require that they be 
able  to  claim  a  greater  share  of  network  resources  and  available  capacity,  the  pri-
ority  assignment  that  automatically  is  given  to  public  safety  traffic  on  the  network 
will  assure  that  they  can—in  the  most  extreme  circumstances—pre-empt  all  other 
traffic on the network, if required. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JIM DEMINT TO 

MORGAN O’BRIEN 

Question  1.  In  your  testimony,  you  explained  at  length  the  benefits  of  your  pro-
posal to the public safety community. During the Committee’s hearing, we also dis-
cussed the fact that your proposal is a for-profit venture. Does Cyren Call have out-
side  investors,  and  if  so,  could  you  share  with  the  Committee  the  information  you 
furnished to potential investors regarding possible returns on their investments? 

Answer.  Cyren  Call  has  derived  most  of  its  financial  support—apart  from  initial 
start-up funding amounts supplied by its founders and a small group of ‘‘friends and 
family’’—from  investments  made  in  Cyren  Call  by  a  number  of  venture  capital 
firms.  Both  leading  up  to  those  investments  and  subsequently,  in  regular  review 
sessions, Cyren Call has shared with those firms (and has sought and received their 
input on) the business and financial models that Cyren Call has created to describe 
and depict the overall shared public safety-commercial broadband network business 
and its financial characteristics. 

In the simplest terms, the depiction of the overall network business, and its pres-
entation  in  the  related  financial  model,  is  an  amalgamation  of  two  distinct,  but 
inter-related  businesses  and  financial  models:  (1)  a  business,  and  related  financial 
model,  that  pertains  only  to  the  commercial  network  operator(s)  (‘‘Lessee(s)’’);  and

(2)  a  business,  and  related  financial  model,  that  pertains  only  to  an  entity  referred 
to as the PSBT Authorized Agent/Public Safety Liaison Agent (‘‘Agent’’; this is that 
role  that  Cyren  Call  intends  to  seek  for  itself).  The  amalgamation  of  these  two  dis-
tinct,  but  inter-related  businesses,  and  the  resulting  related  composite  financial 
model, we refer to as the ‘‘eco-system.’’ We characterized and presented the business 
in  this  way  because  it  would  be  essential  for  any  investor  to  focus  not  only  on 
whether the Agent’s business plan and prospects appeared reasonable, sensible and 
viable, but also whether the overall network business of the Lessee(s) (in which con-
text  the  Agent’s  business  activities  would  occur  and  on  which  they  would  depend) 
also had a plan and prospects that appeared reasonable, sensible and viable. 

Wherever possible, we have attempted to verify that our financial model is based 
on  or  is  consistent  with  publicly  available  information  on  matters  such  as  current 
industry  trends,  analysts’  forecasts,  equipment  manufacturers’  estimates  on  costs, 
and  published  data  concerning  performance  capabilities  of  evolving  technologies 
which  are  not  yet  available  for  commercial  deployment.  We  also  have  engaged  in 
some degree of cross-extrapolation from other industries or businesses that we con-
sidered to be similar or related to the domestic commercial mobile wireless industry 
such  as  wireline  broadband  networks,  existing  wireless  high-speed  networks  in  the 
U.S. and wireless broadband networks in other countries. The assumptions that are 
reflected  or  incorporated  in  our  business  plans  and  in  the  related  financial  models 
include a number of important topics, such as: 
• Addressable market sizes and compositions 
• Subscriber penetration rates 
• Product and service adoption rates 
• Product and service pricings 
• Subscriber profiles 
• Network capacity utilization rates 
• Technology performance and availability 
• Network and subscriber equipment costs 
• Funding timing and availability 
We  have  prepared  presentations  that  summarize  the  key  points  of  the  business 
plans  and  of  the  related  financial  models  described  above.  Those  presentations  in-
clude  the  derivation  of  un-levered  internal  rates  of  return  for  the  respective  busi-
nesses  of  the  Lessee(s)  and  the  Agent  that  comprise  the  eco-system  over  the  ten- 
year period of time covered by the models. We have shared those presentations with 
governmental  bodies  (such  as  personnel  in  the  Congressional  Budget  Office),  with 
staff personnel from various Members of Congress, and with members of the media, 
although we have done so in face-to-face meetings that permitted us to supply addi-
tional  explanatory  detail.  We  would,  of  course,  be  willing  to  deliver  the  same  type 
of  presentation  to  you  and/or  your  staff,  as  well  as  to  any  other  members  of  the 
Committee or their staffs, much as we have done and continue to do for other Mem-
bers of Congress. 

Question  2.  It  seems  as  though  your  entire  business  plan  is  based  on  Congress 
passing  legislation  to  grant  30  MHz  to  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  in  the 
next several months. What happens to Cyren Call if the DTV transition and auction 
goes forward as planned? 

Answer.  The  company’s  founders  and  employees  came  together  around  the  com-
monly-held vision of making this shared public safety-commercial mobile broadband 
network business plan a reality, and the commonly-held belief that this was a task 
worthy  of  the  effort.  The  financial  outcome  to  the  company  might  be  no  different 
if  Congress  passed  legislation  granting  the  requested  30  MHz  to  the  Public  Safety 
Broadband  Trust  (PSBT),  and  the  PSBT  then  decided  to  select  someone  other  than 
Cyren Call as Agent, than if the Congress failed to act and the auction went forward 
as currently legislated. We continue to believe that the DTV transition itself should 
occur  on  the  same  timetable  and  with  the  same  end  results—i.e.,  the  commercial 
TV broadcasters vacating the upper 700 MHz spectrum they currently occupy by the 
February  2009  deadline,  and  the  Treasury  receiving  sufficient  aggregate  proceeds, 
in exchange for the award of licenses to the 60 MHz of 700 MHz spectrum, to meet 
all  related  existing  budget  allocations  and  spending  commitments—regardless 
whether  Congress  adopts  legislation  to  implement  the  Public  Safety  Broadband 
Trust proposal or whether Congress fails to act and the 700 MHz spectrum proceeds 
to commercial auction as contemplated under existing legislation. 

Cyren  Call  is  led  and  staffed  by  talented  persons,  and  as  much  as  an  innovative 
business  concept  and  a  well  crafted  business  plan  undoubtedly  played  a  role  in 
Cyren  Call’s  ability  to  attract  investment  capital,  the  human  resources  associated

with  formulating  that  plan  and  seeking  to  have  it  implemented  played  a  large  role 
as  well.  With  those  resources,  if  its  focus  must  be  re-directed  away  from  the  busi-
ness  plan  and  the  vision  it  has  been  pursuing  and  advancing  for  the  past  year, 
Cyren Call can turn its attention to investigating other opportunities that may hold 
the  prospect  of  an  interesting  business  and  the  potential  for  a  return  on  its  inves-
tors’  capital.  But  we  remain  focused  on  what  we  perceive  as  a  critically  important 
goal—putting  public  safety  at  the  forefront  of  the  next  generation  of  the  wireless 
broadband technology, product and service evolution. 

In any case, Cyren Call believes it is more important to consider the outcome for 
public  safety  should  Congress  not  act  to  provide  them  with  the  means  to  acquire 
the necessary financing to create, and the assurance of ultimate control over, a mo-
bile  broadband  network  built  to  meet  their  needs.  If  Congress  does  not  act,  we  be-
lieve  that  our  first  responders  will  lose  the  last  realistic  opportunity  to  gain  access 
to a reliable privately funded business case for, and ultimate control over, the public 
safety-grade  broadband  network  that  they  need  and  deserve.  If  the  only  spectrum 
that  is  both  available  now  and  uniquely  suited  to  such  a  purpose  is  auctioned  for 
purely commercial use, the critical ingredient necessary to create a viable, privately 
funded  and  self  sustaining  interoperable,  public  safety-grade  broadband  network 
will forever be lost—and such a regrettable outcome could come to pass all too soon. 
When  the  next  disaster  strikes  America  and  our  first  responders  cannot  commu-
nicate  among  themselves  or  access  advanced  technology  that  could  save  American 
lives—including possibly yours or a member of your family—we will carry that bur-
den as a nation. Congress has the choice of perpetuating the status quo or creatively 
using  opportunities  present  today  to  solve  our  country’s  public  safety  communica-
tions  problems  once  and  for  all.  The  clock  ticks  relentlessly  and  a  decision  must  be 
made quickly. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

HON. STEVE LARGENT 

Question  1.  Opponents  of  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  (PSBT)  proposal 
claim that it would delay the February 2009 DTV transition deadline. However, the 
auction of the remaining 30 MHz could proceed in January 2008, allowing the ana-
log switchover to occur as planned in February 2009. Mr. Largent, could you explain 
why you believe the Public Safety Broadband Trust proposal will delay the February 
2009 DTV transition deadline? 

Answer. The Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act requires the auc-
tion of 60 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band. The Congressional Budget Office 
(CBO)  estimated  that  the  auction  would  result  in  a  net  increase  of  auction  receipts 
of  $10  billion.  The  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  (PSBT)  proposal  would  prevent 
the  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC)  from  auctioning  30  MHz  of  that 
spectrum. 

Rather  than  simply  reduce  the  net  increase  of  auction  receipts  by  half  of  CBO’s 
estimate,  the  PSBT  proposal  would  result  in  an  even  greater  reduction  in  net  auc-
tion  proceeds  because  the  PSBT  proposal  may  result  in  potential  auction  partici-
pants  opting  to  lease  spectrum  from  PSBT  rather  than  bid  at  auction.  Thus,  there 
would be even less than $5 billion in net auction proceeds. In addition, reducing the 
amount of spectrum in the 700 MHz band available for commercial use would likely 
cause the FCC to reduce the number of large-block licenses, which yield greater re-
ceipts as compared to smaller-block licenses on a per-MHz basis. And the loan guar-
antees  required  by  the  PSBT  would  reduce  the  net  auction  proceeds  even  further. 
The Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act mandates that $7.363 bil-
lion of the net auction proceeds be transferred to the general fund of the U.S. Treas-
ury. In addition, in accordance with that legislation and the Call Home Act of 2006, 
$1  billion  of  the  net  auction  proceeds  must  be  used  to  establish  a  grant  program 
to  assist  public  safety  entities  in  the  acquisition  of,  deployment  of,  and  training  for 
the  use  of  certain  interoperable  communications  systems,  and  that  money  must  be 
allocated  no  later  than  October  1,  2007.  Furthermore,  up  to  $1.5  billion  of  the  net 
auction proceeds must be available to assist consumers in the purchase of over-the- 
air digital-to-analog converter boxes. 

Even  assuming  that,  under  the  PSBT  proposal,  a  $5  billion  payment  would  have 
to  be  made  to  the  Treasury  for  the  right  to  manage  the  PSBT,  with  the  decrease 
in auction proceeds resulting from: (1) the absence of 30 MHz from the auction and 
(2)  the  availability  of  spectrum  for  lease  by  the  PSBT,  there  would  not  be  enough 
money  to  pay  for  the  converter  box  program.  The  absence  of  the  converter  box  pro-
gram  would  jeopardize  the  February  17,  2009  transition  date  because  Members  of 
Congress would likely be unwilling to require broadcasters to turn off analog signals

without  Federal  assistance  to  purchase  converter  boxes.  With  the  decrease  in  net 
auction  receipts  caused  by  the  PSBT,  Congress  would  also  be  unable  to  fund  the 
other initiatives, such as the assistance provided to New York broadcasters and the 
low-power  television  and  translator  conversion  program,  that  are  viewed  as  nec-
essary for a smooth and timely completion of the digital television transition. 

Question 2. Mr. Largent, you state that public safety has more than enough spec-
trum  to  build  and  operate  a  network  that  will  support  broadband  applications,  and 
you  specifically  note  that  the  FCC  has  allocated  50  megahertz  to  public  safety  in 
the 4.9 gigahertz band for broadband applications. Do you believe it is economically 
feasible to build a nationwide broadband network in that band? 

Answer.  The  FCC  has  worked  closely  with  the  public  safety  community  to  adopt 
regulations  for  the  4.9  GHz  band  that  will  create  opportunities  for  affordable 
broadband networks in that band. The FCC determined ‘‘that the 4.9 GHz band will 
be  able  to  accommodate  a  variety  of  broadband  applications,  including  technologies 
and  operations  requiring  varying  bandwidths  and  operations  that  are  both  tem-
porary  and  permanent  in  nature.’’  In  November  2004,  the  FCC  promulgated  rules 
that  will  allow  wireless  manufacturers  to  leverage  technology  already  available  in 
the commercial wireless sector in order to provide reliable, affordable, and interoper-
able broadband equipment to our first responders. As industry watchers have noted, 
the ‘‘potentials are enormous’’ for use of this new technology.1 Numerous companies 
have already rolled out or begun development on 4.9 GHz-compatible equipment, as 
well  as  designing  mesh  network  systems  that  will  increase  signal  penetration  and 
system redundancy. 

Brookline, Massachusetts has already taken the first step in installing a 4.9 GHz 
system,  contracting  with  wireless  providers  to  create  a  network  that  will  allow  im-
mediate  access  to  police  reports  and  crime  incidents,  provide  remote  video  surveil-
lance,  and  do  geographic  information  system  (GIS)  mapping.  The  city  expects  to 
achieve  95  percent  signal  penetration  on  the  street  and  90  percent  in  buildings— 
despite  the  numerous  hills,  trees,  and  old  apartment  buildings  dotting  the  land-
scape—and to manage costs by eventually merging with commercial WiFi networks 
in  the  area.  The  Brookline  system  provides  an  example  of  the  potential  for  inter-
operable broadband networking in the 4.9 GHz band. 

Question  3.  One  issue  that  continues  to  vex  policymakers  is  the  buildout  of  wire-
less  services  in  rural  areas.  Could  you  discuss  this  issue,  and  how  either  the  pro-
posal  suggested  by  the  FCC  or  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  proposal  would 
address these concerns? 

Answer.  There  is  no  reason  to  believe  that  the  FCC’s  current  auction  regime— 
which  encourages  the  highest  and  best  use  of  spectrum  licenses—will  not  result  in 
buildout  to  rural  areas.  Licensees  have  a  strong  incentive  to  obtain  the  maximum 
return  from  their  use  of  spectrum,  including  that  portion  of  the  spectrum  serving 
sparsely-populated  areas  of  the  United  States.  Currently,  98  percent  of  Americans 
live  in  counties  served  by  at  least  three  wireless  providers,  and  the  FCC  recently 
concluded that ‘‘CMRS providers are competing effectively in rural areas.’’ 

Significantly,  the  PSBT  proposal  does  not  guarantee  increased  buildout  to  rural 
areas  or  alter  the  market  forces  that  will  inevitably  drive  or  hinder  rural  buildout. 
The  PSBT  proposal  covers  only  99.3  percent  of  the  U.S.  population—the  same  per-
centage  that  already  has  access  to  wireless  services.  Furthermore,  as  Morgan 
O’Brien  has  recognized,  the  PSBT  proposal  depends  on  the  assumption  that  com-
mercial  wireless  providers  will  find  it  profitable  to  build  out  the  network  in  rural 
areas. This assumption is not a guarantee, nor is it unique to the PSBT: it is simply 
a recognition of the market trends that are already enhancing wireless communica-
tions coverage in rural America. While Mr. O’Brien has theorized that the same car-
riers that will build the PSBT in densely-populated areas will subsidize deployment 
in  rural  areas,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  carriers  that  would  build  parts  of  the 
PSBT network in more-populated areas would build networks in rural areas if they 
currently already are not building in those areas. 

To  the  extent  that  the  PSBT  proposal  depends  on  economies  of  scale  and  redis-
tributive  policies  to  decrease  the  costs  of  buildout  in  rural  areas,  the  same  advan-
tages  are  present  in  the  FCC’s  current  proposal  to  allocate  12  MHz  of  the  current 
public  safety  spectrum  in  the  700  MHz  band  to  one  national  licensee  that  would 
manage  national  public  safety  broadband  development,  enhancing  first  responder- 
industry  relationships  and  making  money  through  a  program  of  leasing  access  to 
the public safety spectrum to commercial interests on a preemptible basis. Like the

PSBT proposal, the FCC proposal also does not provide any guarantee that current 
market  trends  combined  with  an  enhancement  of  the  public  safety  community’s  in-
creased purchasing power will result in rural buildout. It does, however, pursue this 
goal  without  disrupting  the  hard-fought  regime  of  the  Digital  Television  Transition 
and Public Safety Act, which provides sufficient spectrum to public safety while also 
providing 60 MHz of new spectrum for commercial use in rural areas. 

Beyond  the  issues  related  to  the  PBST,  let  me  make  clear  that  CTIA  recognizes 
the  desirability  of  ubiquitous  coverage  in  rural  areas.  The  wireless  industry  is 
spending  billions  of  dollars  to  improve  network  coverage,  capacity,  and  quality 
across the United States. The Federal Universal Service Fund has played an impor-
tant  role  in  improving  rural  access  to  wireless  service,  and  as  coverage  expands, 
more  and  more  residents  of  rural  areas  are  turning  to  wireless  to  meet  their  com-
munications needs. Unfortunately, the failure of the Federal Communications Com-
mission to address wireless carrier petitions for Universal Service support in a time-
ly  manner  effectively  denies  Universal  Service  funding  to  wireless  carriers,  depriv-
ing consumers in these rural areas the full benefits of competition. Universal service 
support  mechanisms  should  be  administered  on  a  competitively-  and  technology- 
neutral  basis.  Senator  Stevens’  Universal  Service  bill,  S.  101,  would  impose  a  six- 
month deadline for consideration of these petitions. CTIA supports this provision of 
S. 101. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE TO 

HON. STEVE LARGENT 

Question  1.  If  Congress  chooses  to  go  ahead  with  commercial  auctions  of  the  full 
60  megahertz  of  spectrum  from  the  digital  television  (DTV)  transition—instead  of 
dedicating  30  megahertz  to  the  proposed  ‘‘Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust’’—what 
guarantee  is  there  that  commercial  wireless  carriers  will  build  out  their  wireless 
broadband networks in rural areas? 

Answer.  There  is  no  reason  to  believe  that  the  FCC’s  current  auction  regime— 
which  encourages  the  highest  and  best  use  of  spectrum  licenses—will  not  result  in 
buildout  to  rural  areas.  Licensees  have  a  strong  incentive  to  obtain  the  maximum

more  and  more  residents  of  rural  areas  are  turning  to  wireless  to  meet  their  com-
munications needs. Unfortunately, the failure of the Federal Communications Com-
mission to address wireless carrier petitions for Universal Service support in a time-
ly  manner  effectively  denies  Universal  Service  funding  to  wireless  carriers,  depriv-
ing  consumers  in  these  rural  areas  the  full  benefits  of  competition.  Universal  Serv-
ice support mechanisms should be administered on a competitively- and technology- 
neutral  basis.  Senator  Stevens’  Universal  Service  bill,  S.  101,  would  impose  a  six- 
month deadline for consideration of these petitions. CTIA supports this provision of 
S. 101. 

Question  2.  In  lieu  of  creating  a  ‘‘Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust,’’  what  is  the 
wireless  industry’s  solution  to  providing  public  safety  with  a  nationwide  broadband 
network? 

Answer.  CTIA  and  its  members  fully  support  the  creation  of  an  interoperable 
wireless  broadband  public  safety  network.  The  challenges  faced  by  first  responders 
are  not  based  on  a  lack  of  spectrum,  however.  CTIA’s  largest  carriers  use,  on  aver-
age, 50 MHz of spectrum—almost the same amount of spectrum used by public safe-
ty  agencies  to  provide  voice  and  data  service  to  3  million  first  responders 1—to  pro-
vide  both  voice  and  broadband  data  services  to  more  than  50  million  customers 
each. 

The  challenge  of  building  a  nationwide  public  safety  broadband  network  derives 
from  the  balkanization  of  public  safety  spectrum,  the  resulting  lack  of  interoper-
ability,  and  the  inability  of  local  jurisdictions  to  work  together  to  coordinate  fre-
quencies or to achieve economies of scale. CTIA has submitted comments in support 
of  the  FCC’s  current  proposal  to  remedy  these  problems  by  allocating  12  MHz  of 
the  current  public  safety  spectrum  in  the  700  MHz  band  to  broadband  interoper-
ability.  Under  the  FCC  proposal,  one  national  public  safety  licensee  would  be  re-
sponsible  for  allocating,  managing,  and  building  out  the  public  safety  broadband 
network.  This  licensee  would  also  work  with  the  commercial  wireless  industry  by 
leasing access to commercial interests on a preemptible basis, thereby gaining addi-
tional funds and cooperative partnerships with commercial entities. 

CTIA  believes  that  the  commercial  wireless  industry  can  and  should  provide  the 
public  safety  community  with  invaluable  information  and  expertise  to  improve  effi-
ciency and interoperability of the existing public safety spectrum. To this end, CTIA 
is sponsoring a program through which leaders from the public safety world and ex-
perts from the commercial sector can come together to find the best solutions to our 
first responders’ broadband and interoperability needs. CTIA members have already 
committed themselves to this important effort, which begins on April 9, 2007. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

DAVID BILLSTROM 

Question  1.  Mr.  Billstrom,  in  your  testimony,  you  note  that  the  military  has 
moved  to  IP  radio  technologies.  Are  these  same  technologies  currently  available  to 
local first responders, and if so, what are the major obstacles preventing wider adop-
tion? How can we promote greater coordination among local first responders? 

Answer. Chairman Inouye, your questions get to the heart of the issue before us. 
Yes, the very same technologies used by the U.S. military are available now for first 
responders at the state, county and local level throughout the United States. 

This  is  not  really  a  ‘‘new’’  technology;  it  is  only  ‘‘new’’  to  public  safety.  As  you 
know,  Voice-over-IP  also  known  as  ‘‘VoIP’’  has  existed  in  commercial  form,  embed-
ded  in  many  telecommunication  products,  for  more  than  a  decade.  The  variant  of 
this  technology  used  for  military  and  public  safety  radio  communications,  Radio- 
over-IP (‘‘RoIP’’) is more than 5 years old—a very long time in the technology world. 
Production  implementations  of  RoIP  are  used  every  day,  24/7,  for  mission-critical 
applications throughout the U.S. military—including with special forces—and in cer-
tain applications by the U.S. Coast Guard. These systems are, in many cases, avail-
able for inspection and review by public safety officials. 

At this point there are numerous vendors offering ROIP. We generally recommend 
to  public  safety  agencies  that  they  pursue  software-only  ROIP  vendors  in  order  to 
avoid  the  trap  of  proprietary  hardware.  It  is  my  understanding  that  both  the  De-
partment  of  Defense  and  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  have  deployed  software-only  ROIP 
solutions, but obviously I cannot speak for any of these users. 

1 This  does  not  include  50  MHz  of  spectrum  allocated  to  public  safety  in  the  4.9  GHz  band, 
which  some  public  safety  officials  have  argued  is  better  suited  to  high-speed,  broadband  public 
safety applications.

There  are  two  obstacles  to  wider  adoption  by  the  public  safety  community.  First, 
many  ‘‘new’’  technologies  in  public  safety  are  first  acquired  with  Federal  grant  dol-
lars. Despite SAFECOM recommendations consistent with the use of ROIP, most po-
tential grant applicants in the public safety community are uncertain whether a re-
quest  for  grant  funding  for  ROIP  will  be  favorably  regarded  by  grant  program  offi-
cers.  It  would  help  if  Congress  provided  direction  to  DHS,  NTIA,  HHS  (and  other 
Federal agencies with grant programs) that Federal grant programs should consider 
ROIP grant requests. 

It would be a tremendous improvement just to achieve a ‘‘technology neutral’’ po-
sition  for  grant  dollars—as  the  current  perception  is  heavily  lopsided  toward  ‘‘buy 
more  radios  from  traditional  radio  manufacturers.’’  That  is  an  approach  that  obvi-
ously isn’t working, and is quite expensive relative to the software alternative. 

The other obstacle to adoption by the public safety community is more controver-
sial.  The  traditional  vendors  of  vertically-integrated  radio  systems  for  public  safety 
actively  discourage  the  use  of  ROIP  by  public  safety  in  many  ways,  but  most  out-
rageously by opposing any attempt to connect their proprietary communication sys-
tems with ROIP from other vendors. 

By ‘‘vertically-integrated’’ I mean radio communication systems that are manufac-
tured by a single company, and by the use of patented and/or trade secret protected 
technology, prohibit the use of radios made by any other company on their systems. 
Motorola,  for  instance,  makes  fine  products,  some  of  the  best  in  the  world,  but  the 
trunking radio systems they sell to public safety (and have installed throughout the 
United  States  in  many  of  our  largest  metropolitan  areas)  do  not  permit  the  use  of 
radios  from  any  other  manufacturer.  This  is  a  classic  example  of  a  vertically-inte-
grated product—public safety agencies must purchase the system, including repeat-
ers, dispatch consoles, and all of the radios in the system, from a single (often sole- 
source)  supplier.  Although  vertically-integrated  systems  are  no  longer  available  in 
the computer industry (IBM was the best-known example) because they were super-
seded  by  the  open  market  approach,  they  are  status  quo  in  public  safety  for  radio 
systems. 

The disadvantage of vertically-integrated radio systems when used in public safe-
ty is that the radios are fundamentally not interoperable, since every radio on a sys-
tem  must  be  provided  by  the  system’s  sole  manufacturer.  It  would  be  as  if  Dell 
laptops could only send e-mail to other Dell laptops; e-mail destined for a HP laptop 
wouldn’t  get  through.  The  result  is  that  if  you  must  send  e-mail  to  someone  with 
a  Dell,  you  must  buy  a  Dell  laptop  even  if  you  already  own  an  HP  laptop.  I  know 
public  safety  officials  with  two  or  even  three  radios  mounted  in  their  vehicle  in 
order  to  overcome  a  similar  limitation  imposed  by  the  radio  system  manufacturers. 
It is my opinion that most of the current public safety radio system manufacturers 
are strongly motivated to avoid or even prevent interoperability, in order to preserve 
their proprietary market position. From my business background I find this impres-
sive; as a first responder I find this deplorable. 

In  the  same  way  that  these  radio  system  manufacturers  have  absolutely  prohib-
ited the use of radios made by any other manufacturer in their vertically-integrated 
systems,  they  have  also  prevented  their  radio  systems  from  being  interconnected 
with ROIP technology made by any other company. 

Wider  adoption  of  ROIP  by  public  safety  would  be  encouraged  if  DHS  refused  to 
fund  any  radio  system  purchases  (or  even  upgrades)  if  the  radio  system  was  not 
open to ROIP technologies, specifically including ROIP products from vendors other 
than the radio system manufacturer. 

Question 1a. Are these technologies sufficiently robust and reliable? 
Answer. The answer is simple, Radio-over-IP (‘‘RoIP’’) is as robust and reliable as 

the computer network equipment used to implement the technology. 

Even  with  this  fundamental  axiom,  I  have  seen  some  confusion  and  misunder-
standing regarding ‘‘reliability’’ and even ‘‘security’’ of ROIP. This is surely because 
these critics are confusing ‘‘public safety grade’’ IP networks with the DSL Internet 
connections  many  of  us  use  to  check  e-mail  at  home.  It  is  completely  different.  A 
network  can  be  completely  closed,  secure,  and  protected  from  disruption.  The  De-
partment  of  Defense,  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard,  and  many  private  and  public  corpora-
tions  have  billions  of  dollars  at  stake  as  well  as  millions  of  lives  on  their  computer 
networks.  These  organizations  use  secure  and  redundant  IP  networks  on  a  24/7 
basis.  The  equipment  used  to  install  and  operate  those  networks  is  the  exact  same 
equipment used in ROIP systems. Public safety grade IP networks are not only reli-
able  and  robust,  but  they  are  more  reliable  and  more  robust  than  the  proprietary 
radio systems built by traditional radio manufacturers. 

This  is  because  there  are  more  users—millions  of  more  users  world-wide—for  se-
cure  computer  networks  than  there  are  police  and  fire  radio  users.  History  shows 
that  technology  innovation  is  driven  most  effectively  when  millions  of  users  push

the  products  and  technology  to  its  limits,  and  vendors  are  inspired  to  drive  quality 
up and costs down. The serious customers of IP networks such as military services, 
governments, and corporations, have driven technology innovation and reliability in 
IP  network  equipment  for  decades  now.  The  resulting  competitive  market  (unlike 
the sole-source market of traditional public safety radio system manufacturers) has 
led to higher quality and lower price. 

Not  only  is  ROIP  more  robust  and  more  reliable,  it  is  generally  less  expensive 

than traditional radio systems. 

I  will  reiterate  my  testimony  in  front  of  your  committee:  RoIP  is  not  perfect  and 
does not solve all public safety communication problems, but it is a tremendous step 
forward toward increased interoperability. And it is affordable. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

DAVID BILLSTROM 

Question 1. Mr. Billstrom, thank you for making the trip across the country from 
that other Washington to be with us today. You have an ideal background to speak 
to the issues the Committee is exploring at this hearing. You are the CEO of a high- 
tech  company  that  provides  systems  integration  services  for  public  safety  organiza-
tion and you are yourself a first responder in your local community in the San Juan 
Islands. 

As  you  may  know,  a  number  of  Washington  State  public  safety  officials  in  the 
counties  closest  to  Canada  have  expressed  concerns  regarding  Nextel’s  re-banding 
of  public  safety  radios  within  the  800  megahertz  public  safety  band.  In  particular, 
for  the  re-banding  to  be  successful  on  our  side  of  the  border,  there  needs  to  be  cor-
responding  changes  on  the  other  side  of  the  border  we  share  with  Canada  and  a 
revision to our existing treaty. Putting on your hat as a first responder, are you con-
cerned  about  the  slow  progress  the  State  Department  is  making  with  its  Canadian 
counterpart  with  respect  to  modifying  the  existing  treaty  addressing  this  spectrum 
issue?  How  important  is  it  to  get  this  done  in  a  timely  manner  as  the  region  pre-
pares for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver? 

Answer.  Thank  you  Senator  Cantwell  for  your  kind  remarks,  and  thank  you  for 

the opportunity to respond to these important questions. 

Even without the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver approaching, this is an im-
portant  issue  for  public  safety  responders  in  Washington,  and  in  all  States  along 
the  Canadian  border  with  the  United  States.  With  the  Olympics,  this  important 
issue  has  become  a  critical  factor  in  the  ability  for  first  responders  in  the  region 
to be ready. 

The  problem  is  that  radio  systems—antennas  on  mountain  tops  and  tall  build-
ings—take  time  to  design,  manufacture,  and  install.  Almost  all  of  the  equipment 
used  in  a  radio  system  is  highly  specific  to  the  radio  frequency  used.  As  a  con-
sequence, a new radio system needs to know which frequencies it will use more than 
a year before the system is to be used. 

The 800 MHz Rebanding is a complex and difficult issue, but at the highest level, 
the  program  is  a  mandatory  change  of  every  800  MHz  public  safety  radio  system 
in the United States. In a program approved by the FCC, argued in the courts, and 
in  development  for  years,  every  public  safety  radio  system  using  800  MHz  in  the 
United  States  must  be  re-built  and  re-deployed  on  new  frequencies.  The  program 
is  behind  schedule,  in  part  due  to  the  inability  to  acquire  new  frequencies  for  the 
public safety agencies on the border with Canada. 

It has always been difficult to acquire frequencies for public safety agencies in Ca-
nadian border areas (which reach down from the border farther south than Seattle). 
In  fact,  the  Blaine,  Washington  police  department  doesn’t  even  have  one  frequency 
approved, they are forced to use radios from the U.S. Border Patrol since they can-
not have their own. 

The  slow,  and  sometimes  impossible,  process  of  coordinating  frequencies  with 
Canada  has  impeded  the  safety  of  public  safety  personnel  for  years.  Now  it  is  pre-
venting the 800 MHz Rebanding program from forward progress. 

Because  it  takes  time  to  install  new  radio  systems,  and  the  new  systems  must 
be  built  for  the  exact  frequencies  approved  by  the  U.S.  and  Canada,  the  800  MHz 
Rebanding needs to resolve frequency allocation with Canada immediately. I cannot 
provide  an  exact  timeframe,  but  I  would  estimate  that  if  the  logjam  with  Canada 
is  not  broken  within  the  next  4  to  6  months,  it  will  be  impossible  to  complete  the 
800  MHz  Rebanding  before  the  Olympics.  This  in  turn  will  endanger  public  safety 
responders and the general public. 

Question  2.  Let  me  shift  to  the  OPSCAN  project  funded  by  the  Department  of 
Homeland Security that coordinated communication of over forty local, state, tribal,

120 

and Federal agencies operating in the Olympic peninsula. My understanding is that 
the  project  relied  on  a  microwave  backbone,  mutual  aid  bases,  Radio-over-Internet- 
protocol  technology,  gateway  devices,  and  really  focused  on  tying  together  legacy 
communications systems operating in different frequency bands. Would you say the 
key  to  the  project  was  new  hardware  or  open  standards-based  software?  Based  on 
your  experience,  do  you  believe  that  OPSCAN  is  a  successful  model  for  addressing 
the legacy equipment issues facing public safety agencies in numerous jurisdictions 
across the country? 

Answer.  Yes,  OPSCAN  is  a  model  for  public  safety  agencies  across  the  country 
for the simple and incredibly important reason that it dramatically improved inter-
operability  by  using  ROIP  (or  IP  Radio)  without  requiring  a  single  first  responder 
to buy a new radio. 

This is because OPSCAN ties together existing radio systems, and the radio users 
in  any  one  of  those  radio  systems  simply  keeps  using  their  existing  radio,  on  their 
existing system, but can reach radio users on other radio systems. 

OPSCAN  was  an  ambitious  project,  with  at  least  three  major  objectives:  to  im-

prove coverage, to improve reliability, and to improve interoperability. 

Coverage was improved by adding new radio towers. Reliability was improved by 
installing  ROIP  as  the  method  of  controlling  base  station  and  repeater  radios.  As 
discussed  in  my  answer  to  Chairman  Inouye’s  question  about  reliability,  the  use  of 
industry-standard  IP  network  hardware  in  the  OPSCAN  radio  network  increased 
OPSCAN’s  reliability.  The  digital  microwave  backbone  was  improved,  with  redun-
dancy,  to  host  the  IP  network.  The  OPSCAN  objectives  of  improving  coverage  and 
reliability are typical of what is needed with many of the public safety radio systems 
across the U.S., particularly in rural and suburban areas. 

OPSCAN’s interoperability objective was met when the ROIP system incorporated 
the radio system of participating public safety agencies (47 agencies so far). Not only 
can radio users on any one system reach radio users on the other system(s), but 911 
and  dispatch  centers  throughout  the  region  can  all  access  the  radio  systems  on  the 
network.  ‘‘Interoperability’’  between  dispatch  centers  is  perhaps  more  important 
than interoperability between radio users in the field. 

In  my  experience,  I  have  never  heard  of  a  radio  system  upgrade  of  this  scope— 
that is, with 40+ agencies and a wide geographic area—that didn’t require all of the 
participants  to  buy  new  radios  for  every  officer,  every  vehicle,  and  every  dispatch 
center.  By  using  standards-based  software  and  standards-based  IP  network  hard-
ware, this radio system upgrade was accomplished without requiring a massive mo-
bile and handheld radio purchase. 

This  is  a  model  for  interoperability  that  is  within  the  scope  of  most  state  (and 

even some county) budgets across the United States. 

Question  3.  As  you  know  in  the  Pacific  Northwest,  we  are  all  very  excited  about 
the  economic  potential  of  the  2010  Olympics  in  Vancouver  British  Columbia.  This 
event  presents  a  number  of  challenges  with  respect  to  coordinating  land,  air,  and 
sea communications across local, state and Federal agencies in two nations. In your 
view,  what  does  San  Juan  and  other  border  counties  need  to  do  with  respect  to 
interoperable  communications  in  order  to  prepare  for  the  2010  Olympics  and  all  of 
the expected visitors? 

Answer.  This  is  an  excellent  question,  and  not  only  is  this  a  very  real  issue  for 
the  5–6  counties  that  will  be  directly  impacted  by  the  huge  influx  of  welcome  visi-
tors over many months, but it also serves as a model for any high-impact, high-vol-
ume tourist event in the U.S. 

First, the aforementioned logjam between the U.S. and Canada on the authoriza-
tion of new frequencies in the 800 MHz band for public safety must be resolved com-
pletely  within  the  next  4–6  months  in  order  for  construction  required  by  the  800 
MHz Rebanding to begin, and then finish prior to the Olympics. 

Second,  the  5–6  counties  in  the  region  should  receive  immediate  funding  for  a 
ROIP  (or  IP  Radio)  system  implemented  across  the  region,  and  incorporating  Fed-
eral  U.S.  agencies  and  of  course  provincial  and  national  Canadian  agencies.  This 
should  be  an  OPSCAN-like  system,  although  there  is  no  longer  enough  time  prior 
to  the  Olympics  to  build  new  radio  towers  for  coverage  (OPSCAN  suffered  lengthy 
delays due to tower construction). 

Third, a comprehensive training program should be conducted throughout the re-
gion so that the first responders that make up the bulk of the response to any crit-
ical incident associated with the Olympics (or the influx of visitors to the Olympics) 
will  have  the  interoperable  communication  skills.  While  Federal  funding  has  been 
provided for training and drills in the most recent 2 years, it has primarily benefited 
the  readiness  of  large  metropolitan  areas.  The  5–6  counties  in  the  region  affected 
by  the  Olympics  are  primarily  rural  and  small  towns,  with  much  of  public  safety

emergency  response  provided  by  volunteers.  We  need  to  get  communications  train-
ing to those volunteers. 

I  know  my  colleagues  in  San  Juan  County  are  ready  for  emergencies;  they  re-
spond every day and provide professional service. But in the past several years, the 
Federal  agencies  around  them  such  as  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard,  Immigrations  and 
Customs  Enforcement,  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation,  and  other  DHS  responders 
have  all  acquired  new  radios  and  new  radio  systems.  These  new,  proprietary  sys-
tems are incompatible with the radios used by first responders in most of the region 
affected by the Olympics. Without an OPSCAN-like IP Radio system to interconnect 
the  existing  first  responder  radio  systems  with  the  new  Federal  radio  systems,  we 
face  the  potential  for  another  massive  failure  of  first  responder  communications  as 
seen on 9/11 and during Katrina. 

With the I–5 freeway corridor passing through small towns and rural countryside 
for  most  of  its  length  between  Vancouver  and  Seattle,  and  with  the  Washington 
State  Ferry  System  passing  through  the  rural  San  Juan  Islands,  we  must  prepare 
our  rural  and  small  town  first  responders  with  interoperable  communications—but 
not by buying all of them new radios. 

Question  4.  Is  there  a  standard  for  public  safety  personnel  to  exchange  data?  To 
exchange  video?  Should  any  standards  developed  be  open  standards?  What  is  the 
danger of not having open standards? 

Answer.  There  is  extensive  discussion  on  the  topic  of  standards  for  (digital)  data 
exchange  among  public  safety  agencies,  but  there  is  no  ‘‘open’’  standard.  As  I  have 
outlined previously with the open standards used in IP networks, an open standard 
for public safety data exchange will encourage participation by many providers and 
vendors, which in turn encourages innovation and drives costs down. 

Without  open  standards,  we  will  face  the  usual  monopoly,  or  at  best  duopoly,  of 
a  single  vendor’s  proprietary  standard.  This  will  keep  costs  up,  and  leave  quality 
and  product  features  at  a  mediocre  level  at  best.  There  is  also  an  aspect  of  ‘‘inter-
operability’’  with  data  standards,  including  video,  that  would  impede  the  exchange 
of crucial information during an emergency, in the same way that public safety voice 
radio  communication  interoperability  is  impeded  today  by  the  dominance  of  mutu-
ally-exclusive proprietary radio systems. 

Question  5.  Many  communities  rely  on  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s 
SAFECOM  guidance  in  guiding  purchase  and  requests  related  to  facilitating  inter-
operable  communications.  Do  you  believe  that  historically  DHS  has  focused  too 
much  on  hardware  solutions?  Do  you  believe  that  DHS  guidance  in  the  past  has 
chilled local governments from pursuing IP-based solutions? 

Answer.  I  find  it  awkward  to  criticize  an  agency  that  has  provided  essential  and 
valuable funding for public safety agencies, but it is an objective truth that the first 
years  of  SAFECOM  guidance  focused  on  the  relatively  obvious  solutions,  from  the 
relatively obvious traditional communications vendors. Understandably, those tradi-
tional  radio  system  vendors,  with  decades-long  experience  and  track  record  with 
hardware, proposed hardware solutions. 

It  is  not  an  accident  that  one  of  the  first  innovations  for  public  safety  interoper-
ability  came  from  a  defense  contractor—an  ‘‘interoperability  switch’’  that  could  be 
used at the emergency scene. I think it is notable that this solution did not emerge 
from  traditional  radio  system  manufacturers.  These  interoperability  switches  (also 
called ‘‘gateways’’) are hardware-intensive solutions, and have numerous limitations, 
but  play  an  essential  role.  SAFECOM  has  recommended  gateways  for  some  time, 
which  was  appropriate  given  the  resistance  to  interoperable  radios.  At  the  time,  it 
was  well-known  in  the  public  safety  community  that  gateways  could  be  acquired 
easily in DHS grant programs. 

During the past 2 years SAFECOM has essentially been silent on the topic of soft-
ware  generally,  and  IP  Radio  (or  ROIP)  software  in  particular.  This  should  be  sur-
prising to everyone, as the U.S. continues to lead software innovation in all sectors, 
and  in  nearly  all  industries,  relative  to  every  other  country.  Where  is  the  com-
prehensive  review  of  software  technology  as  it  applies  to  Homeland  Security,  and 
to interoperable communication? I believe that there is a faulty, but widespread be-
lief that communications is a ‘‘hardware’’ problem despite extensive evidence to the 
contrary,  including  but  not  limited  to  the  U.S.  as  a  leader  of  VoIP  phones  used  in 
both business and residences. 

And  yes,  SAFECOM  has  negatively  influenced  the  use  of  IP-based  solutions  by 
local  governments.  Let  me  be  clear;  it  isn’t  that  SAFECOM  needed  to  endorse  or 
promote  ROIP  technology  (it  hasn’t).  The  issue  is  that  the  program  has  largely  re-
mained silent on the issue, which has had the same effect as condemning it. 

Local governments already perceive new technologies as risky, which is a healthy 
perspective.  However  ROIP  is  only  ‘‘new’’  to  public  safety;  it  has  been  in  use  for

sometime  in  the  military.  We  can’t  expect  local  governments  to  be  aware  of  tech-
nology  deployments  in  the  military  and  Coast  Guard,  and  use  that  information  to 
guide their decisions, but I do think we should expect DHS to do exactly that. 

Thank you again for the opportunity to comment. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

MATTHEW J. DESCH 

Question. Mr. Desch, in your testimony, you discuss the role that satellite commu-
nications can play in improving the redundancy of emergency communications capa-
bilities. Is cost the major obstacle to more redundant communications systems? Are 
there other obstacles? 

Answer.  I  do  not  believe  that  cost  is  the  major  obstacle  to  the  deployment  of  re-
dundant  communications  systems.  Iridium  and  other  satellite  communications  pro-
viders  pride  themselves  on  their  efforts  to  offer  first  responders  redundant  commu-
nications solutions at reasonable prices. Iridium, for example, continues to bring sat-
ellite  handsets  to  the  market  at  prices  that  make  satellite  an  affordable  option  for 
first  responders  and  public  safety  personnel,  as  well  as  for  the  private  sector.  In 
fact, Iridium prides itself on its partnerships with government agencies, like the De-
partment of Defense, and the private sector to develop redundant devices and serv-
ices.  Iridium  is  committed  to  continuing  to  do  so,  as  our  recent  partnership  with 
Raytheon  demonstrates—offering  public  safety  an  integrated  interoperable  and  re-
dundant communications package. 

Instead, one of the most significant obstacles to a redundant communications sys-
tem  for  public  safety  is  the  lack  of  funds  for  the  purchase  of  these  devices.  Public 
safety  organizations  often  function  within  very  limited  budgets  and  lack  the  means 
to purchase interoperable and redundant communications systems. This Committee 
has  already  taken  great  strides  toward  ensuring  that  first  responders  have  the 
funds  necessary  to  purchase  advanced,  interoperable,  and  redundant  communica-
tions  equipment.  The  $1  billion  you  allocated  in  the  DTV  Act  was  a  good  first  step 
in this direction, and the additional provisions in S. 385 that allow for the purchase 
and  pre-positioning  of  communications  equipment  and  communications  service,  in-
cluding satellite, will help make sure that first responders will have access to redun-
dant communications equipment. Both policymakers and public safety concede, how-
ever,  that  $1  billion  is  not  enough  to  guarantee  that  all  the  public  safety  organiza-
tions in the Nation can purchase satellite-based devices for those times when terres-
trial networks are ineffective or inoperable. 

Another significant impediment to the development of a truly effective redundant 
communications  network  for  our  Nation’s  first  responders  has  been  the  lack  of  an 
integrated emergency communications plan that embraces satellite. The communica-
tions failings on September 11 prompted an examination of the need for communica-
tions interoperability amongst first responders. It was not until the communications 
failings caused by the Gulf Coast hurricane disaster, however, that the Nation real-
ized  that  communications  redundancy  for  first  responders  was  also  needed  in  our 
emergency  communications  planning.  Any  truly  effective  national  emergency  com-
munications  plan  must  include  both  interoperability  and  redundancy—interoper-
ability is fruitless when the terrestrial communications networks that the interoper-
able system is built on no longer exist. 

This  need  for  an  integrated  national  emergency  communications  plan  has  been 
embraced by this Committee and this Congress. The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity  communications  reforms  passed  last  fall  in  the  Department’s  Fiscal  Year  2007 
Appropriations bill direct the Department to begin exploring and developing this na-
tional  plan.  Iridium  strongly  supports  the  provisions  in  S.  385  that  direct  the  FCC 
to study the development of a national emergency communications back-up system, 
particularly  because  that  study  must  include  an  examination  of  the  use  of  satellite 
communications for such a system. Satellite is the only logical choice for that back- 
up system because it is the communications fail safe for first responders, and I hope 
that the FCC will conclude as much if the study is conducted.

The  benefit  of  development  of  this  national  communications  plan  does  not  stop 
with first responders. As the public sector begins to acknowledge the need for redun-
dant  communications  solutions  in  emergency  situations,  the  private  sector  will  do 
so  as  well.  Iridium  has  already  begun  to  partner  with  private  corporations,  like 
MedStar  Health,  to  develop  devices  that  will  function  in  worst-case  scenarios.  I  be-
lieve that other private sector organizations will follow the government’s and public 
safety’s lead once satellite redundancy is embraced as part of a national emergency 
communications plan.
