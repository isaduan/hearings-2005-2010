Winning Teams and

Innovative Technologies From

the 2005 Solar Decathlon

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 2005

2:00 P.M.–4:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

1. Purpose

On  Wednesday,  November  2,  the  Energy  Subcommittee  of  the  House  Committee
on  Science  will  hold  a  hearing  to  showcase  winning  teams  and  energy  technology
highlights  from  the  2005  Solar  Decathlon,  a  Department  of  Energy  sponsored  com-
petition  in  which  student  teams  design  and  build  homes  powered  entirely  by  solar
energy.  The  Subcommittee  will  also  examine  the  research  and  policy  implications
of the Decathlon, including steps necessary to make solar power more viable in the
mainstream market.

3. Overarching Questions

• What  are  some  of  the  innovative  solar  and  efficiency  technologies  the  teams
chose to incorporate into their homes? Which of these technologies are experi-
mental and which are ready for (or in) the market?
• What  are  the  main  technical  and  other  barriers  to  greater  use  of  solar  en-
ergy?  How  can  contests  such  as  the  Solar  Decathlon  help  move  both  renew-
able and efficiency technologies into the mainstream building market?

4. Background on Decathlon
Purpose of Decathlon

The  Solar  Decathlon  is  a  competition  developed  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Ener-
gy’s  (DOE)  Office  of  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy  (EERE)  in  partner-
ship  with  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Lab  (NREL)  and  several  non-govern-
mental sponsors.1 According to DOE, the purpose of the Decathlon is—

• to encourage young people to pursue careers in science and engineering;
• to  acquaint  college  students  in  science,  engineering  and  architecture  with

solar power and energy efficiency;

1 Information on sponsors can be found on the Decathlon website: http://www.eere.energy.gov/
solar¥decathlon/sponsors.html  The  main  sponsors  were:  The  American  Institute  of  Architects,
National Association of Home Builders, BP Solar, DIY Network and Sprint Nextel. Several other
organizations and companies provided additional support.

use our energy;

• to  encourage  participating  students  to  think  in  new  ways  about  the  way  we
• to push research and development of energy efficiency and energy production
technologies,  helping  the  U.S.  maintain  its  technological  competitive  edge;
and
• to  educate  consumers  about  what  they  can  do  to  add  solar  power  or  reduce

energy use in their own homes in ways that maintain their lifestyles.

The Competition

DOE held the first Solar Decathlon on the National Mall in 2002, and the second
from  October  6–16  of  this  year.  Current  plans  are  to  hold  the  decathlon  every  two
years in the future. The homes are open to the public for several hours a day during
the competition. More than 100,000 visitors toured the solar homes last month, de-
spite the relentless rain that plagued the competition.

Teams wanting to participate must submit proposals two years in advance of the
competition.  The  proposals  are  reviewed  by  the  Solar  Decathlon  Proposal  Review
Committee,  consisting  of  architects,  engineers,  scientists  and  other  experts  chosen
by  DOE,  to  determine  if  they  stand  a  reasonable  chance  of  carrying  the  project
through to completion, while meeting strict structural and safety requirements. For
the  2005  Decathlon,  The  Review  Committee  selected  20  teams  in  2003  from  a  field
of 24. DOE allotted $5000 to each of the 20 teams. Total federal contribution to the
decathlon  is  estimated  to  be  $1  million,  including  management  and  oversight.
Teams had to obtain all additional funding, materials, and other forms of assistance
from  outside  donors.  Most  teams  ended  up  with  a  total  budget  between  $200,000
and  $300,000  for  their  projects,  including  travel  costs  and  the  expenses  associated
with shipping their house to the National Mall for the contest. In the end, 18 teams
succeeded in bringing homes to the National Mall for the competition.

Teams are made up of undergraduate and graduate students pursuing degrees in
engineering,  architecture,  computer  science,  public  relations,  marketing,  and  other
disciplines,  working  together  to  design  and  build  their  solar-powered  homes.  Each
team has at least one faculty advisor, but students fill the project management and
other leadership roles. Faculty advisors come from various academic disciplines, in-
cluding engineering, architecture and design.

Houses are restricted to a maximum of 800 square feet of total building footprint
and must produce sufficient energy to carry out all normal household functions: food
cooking  and  storage,  clothes  washing  and  drying,  dishwashing,  bathing,  as  well  as
provide sufficient power for normal light levels at night and occasional use of appli-
ances such as televisions and computers.

Each house is judged on 10 attributes (see the Appendix for more information on

each contest):

1. Architecture
2. Dwelling
3. Documentation
4. Communications
5. Comfort zone

6. Appliances
7. Hot water
8. Lighting
9. Energy balance
10. Getting around (ability to charge an electric car).

Each competition is judged by a jury or panel of professionals chosen by DOE for
their renown in their respective fields of architecture, interior design, public affairs,
energy  analysis,  engineering  or  lighting.  Each  category  is  worth  100  points,  except
for  architecture,  which  is  worth  200  points.  A  winner  is  declared  in  each  of  the  10
contests, and points are summed to determine the overall winner. Some contests are
won  by  objectively  measuring  performance  (for  example,  providing  adequate  elec-
tricity to power appliances or lighting) and others are subjectively evaluated (for ex-
ample,  architecture  and  communications).  Out  of  a  total  possible  1100  points,  the
top  three  teams  of  2005—University  of  Colorado,  Cornell  University  and  California
Polytechnic Institute—scored greater than 800 points. However, a number of teams
that  didn’t  make  it  into  the  top  three  overall  did  score  in  the  top  three  in  one  or
more of the 10 competitions. Among the teams represented at this hearing, Virginia
Polytechnic Institute received first place in both architecture and dwelling, and sec-
ond  place  in  energy  balance;  and  New  York  Institute  of  Technology  received  third
place in both architecture and dwelling.
The Technologies

The decathlon houses featured technologies for energy efficiency, heating and cool-
ing, passive and active solar thermal systems, photovoltaic solar electricity, and on-
site  energy  storage,  both  electrical  and  thermal.  Many  of  the  technologies  used  are

available to all consumers in their local home-improvement store, but some are still
in the experimental stage. Below is a general description of the types of technologies
that teams used in the decathlon homes.

Energy efficiency is the key to powering a house using only solar energy. By using
each  kilowatt-hour  wisely,  teams  attempt  to  minimize  the  amount  of  energy  they
need to produce and store. For example, teams used highly efficient appliances and
lighting,  including  fluorescent  and  solid-state  lighting,  to  reduce  the  homes’  total
electricity  demand,  both  directly  and  indirectly—efficient  appliances  emit  less  heat
into the living space and therefore also lower air conditioning demand. Wall panels
and windows were also chosen for their insulation rating and ability to pass or filter
sunlight. While minimizing airflow to and from the outdoors is important to energy
efficiency,  all  homes  require  ventilation  to  control  humidity  and  provide  fresh  air.
Many teams used Energy Recovery Ventilators, which use heat exchangers2 to heat
or cool incoming fresh air, recapturing 60 to 80 percent of the conditioned tempera-
tures that would otherwise be lost. Many of these technologies are readily available
to builders and consumers now. However, most teams also used some experimental
or custom-built energy technologies and systems to reduce their energy demand.

All 18 houses used photovoltaic (PV) solar cells to directly convert sunlight to elec-
tricity. Most schools used the traditional silicon-based solar panels that are mounted
on  rooftops,  and  one  of  the  teams  used  thin-film  PVs  that  can  be  integrated  into
the roofline.

Solar hot water heaters, which use the sun to heat either water or a heat-transfer
fluid  in  collectors,  provided  all  hot  water  needs  for  the  houses.  In  a  typical  house,
where  solar  systems  can  reduce  the  need  for  conventional  water  heating  by  about
two-thirds,  the  plumbing  from  a  solar  heater  may  connect  to  a  house’s  existing
water  heater,  which  stays  inactive  as  long  as  the  water  coming  in  is  hot  or  hotter
than  the  temperature  setting  on  the  indoor  water  heater.  When  it  falls  below  this
temperature, the water heater can kick in to make up the difference. One decathlon
team  captured  waste  heat  from  their  refrigerator—a  water-cooled  unit  designed  for
boats—to  pre-heat  their  hot  water.  Others  added  thermal  collectors  behind  the  PV
panels,  which  boosted  electrical  output  (PVs  are  less  efficient  when  they  get  very
hot) and increased the total amount of solar energy captured per square foot of col-
lector.

All  houses  also  incorporated  elements  of  passive  solar  and  daylighting  designs.
The  term  ‘‘passive’’  implies  that  no  mechanical  means,  such  as  pumps  or  fans,  are
required in the design. For example, passive solar designs can include natural ven-
tilation  for  cooling,  or,  for  heating,  large  south-facing  windows  and  building  mate-
rials  that  absorb  and  slowly  release  the  sun’s  heat.  In  cold  climates,  south-facing
windows designed to let the sun’s heat in while insulating against the cold are ideal.
In  hot  and  moderate  climates,  the  strategy  is  to  admit  light  while  rejecting  heat.
Interior  spaces  requiring  the  most  light,  heat,  and  cooling  are  located  along  the
south face of the building, with less used space to the north. Most houses have open
floor plans to allow more sun inside.

A few of the more unique technology choices, such as the hydrogen fuel-cells used
by the New York Institute of Technology, and the phase-change heating and cooling
system  used  by  the  Rhode  Island  School  of  Design,  will  be  highlighted  during  the
hearing.
5. Solar Energy in the Marketplace3
History

In  1954,  Bell  Labs  introduced  the  first  solar  photovoltaic  device  that  produced  a
useful amount of electricity, and by 1958, solar cells were being used in small-scale
scientific and commercial applications, in particular for the space program. The en-
ergy  crisis  of  the  1970s  stimulated  broader  interest  in  solar  power  in  the  United
States  and  elsewhere.  Prohibitive  prices  (approximately  30  times  current  prices)
made  large-scale  applications  unfeasible.  However,  industry  developments  and  re-
search during the 1970’s and 1980’s made PV feasible for remote applications (espe-
cially for the telecommunications industry) and a cycle of increasing production and
decreasing costs began which continues today.

New,  next-generation  PV  materials  currently  under  development  may  yet  bring
dramatic  decreases  in  price.  DOE  research  and  development  (R&D)  funding  for  PV

2 Heat  exchangers  are  devices  specifically  designed  for  the  efficient  transfer  of  heat  from  one
fluid to another over a solid surface. In the case of an energy recovery ventilator, the heat from
the stale exhaust air is used to preheat the fresh-stream air coming into the house. In the case
of cooling, heat is instead pulled from the incoming air.

reached  a  peak  in  1980  of  $260  million  (inflation  adjusted  to  1999  dollars).  The
1980’s saw significant cuts, down to a low of $44 million in 1988 (inflation adjusted
to 1999 dollars). Current DOE spending for PV R&D is $76.3 million, and the fiscal
year 2006 request is $75 million. Small PV systems may also play a role in the tran-
sition  to  a  hydrogen  economy,  as  they  can  produce  hydrogen  through  electrolysis,
as demonstrated by the New York Institute of Technology decathlon team.

Consumer Economics

A  typical  home  PV  system  is  two  kilowatts  (kW)  capacity  and  costs  $14,000  to
$20,000  to  install.  This  is  enough  to  power  an  average-size  home  built  to  high  en-
ergy  efficiency  standards.  Using  typical  financing  assumptions,  a  home  PV  system
will  generate  power  at  a  fixed  and  constant  $.25—$.35/kW-hour  over  its  25-year-
plus  lifetime.  The  cost  of  PV  is  still  higher  than  the  equivalent  retail  cost  of  elec-
tricity that it offsets for the user—as high as $.14/kW-hour currently in parts of the
U.S.  However,  costs  for  PV  modules  have  historically  decreased  by  5–7  percent  per
year, with cost decreases to date apparently tied to manufacturing volume, as shown
in  Fig.  1.  Integration  of  PV  into  the  construction  of  new  homes  can  also  lower  the
installation  cost  and  allow  the  equipment  to  be  paid  for  in  the  mortgage,  adding
minimally  to  the  monthly  payment.  Federal  and  State  tax  incentives,  rebates  and
loan guarantees help lower the cost even further for many customers.
The Global Market and Eroding U.S. Leadership

Global PV market growth has averaged at least 25 percent annually over the last
10 years, with worldwide growth rates for the last five years at well over 35 percent
(equivalent  to  a  doubling  of  installed  power  every  four  years  or  less).  However,  PV
still  accounts  for  a  small  percentage  of  electricity  generation  worldwide.  Figure  2
shows  the  cumulative  worldwide  PV  manufactured  between  1996  and  2004.  There
is approximately 4,000 megawatts (MW) of PV generating capacity worldwide, in ad-
dition  to  354  MW  of  concentrating  solar  power4 and  possibly  as  much  as  70
Gigawatts (GW) of solar heating capacity.5

4 Concentrating  Solar  Power  devices  optically  focus  or  concentrate  the  thermal  energy  of  the
sun to drive a generator or heat engine. They do so by means of lenses or more commonly mir-
rors arranged in a dish, trough or tower configuration.

The  United  States  was  once  the  leader  in  solar  technologies,  but  in  2004,  U.S.
companies  manufactured  only  11  percent  of  photovoltaics  (in  terms  of  MW  output)
available  worldwide.  Japan  surpassed  the  U.S.  as  the  global  manufacturing  leader
in 1999, and Germany has since eclipsed the U.S. as well. Japan has manufactured
approximately 44 percent; Europe, 25 percent; and the U.S., 19 percent of PV avail-
able in the market in the last decade. The percentages for installed capacity closely
track  the  percentages  for  manufacturing  output.  The  U.S.  had  approximately  365
MW  of  installed  capacity  by  the  end  of  2004—roughly  equivalent  to  the  output  of
a standard coal-fired plant, or approximately 0.04 percent of U.S. electricity produc-
tion. Germany and Japan are ahead in installed capacity in large part because they
both  instituted  significant  incentive  programs  for  solar.  Since  its  passage  in  2000,
the German Renewable Energy Sources Act ensures that utilities get paid 3–4 times
the retail rates for electricity generated by solar installations. Ten years ago, Japan
instituted  a  successful  rebate  program  that  is  slowly  being  phased  out.  Despite  its
position  as  laggard  in  both  manufacturing  and  installed  capacity,  the  U.S.  has  tre-
mendous growth potential for solar energy, as illustrated by the solar intensity map
in  Fig.  3.  Here  in  the  U.S.,  California  is  taking  the  lead  with  over  100  MW  of  in-
stalled  grid  capacity  to  date,  but  as  the  side-by-side  comparison  with  sunshine  in
Germany demonstrates, even states that are less sunny than California can benefit
from  solar  energy—most  of  the  U.S.  has  a  much  better  solar  resource  than  Ger-
many.

While  few  analysts  expect  that  solar  manufacturing  capacity  can  continue  to  ex-
pand at this pace, if the growth rate of the last five years could be maintained, peak
solar  capacity  could  match  today’s  domestic  coal-fired  capacity  by  2025.  Even  then,
since  coal  capacity  is  available  more  hours  of  the  day  than  solar,  the  total  output
of kilowatt-hours from the solar capacity would be less.

Electricity demand varies throughout the day, as air conditioning and commercial
activities peak in the afternoon. Base load is the amount of electricity needed to run
all  the  systems  that  operate  day  and  night:  refrigerators,  water  heaters,  traffic
lights,  etc.  Absent  an  economical  storage  system,  solar  energy  may  not  be  ideal  for
base  load  electricity  demand,  but  it  is  ideally  suited  to  peak  load  production,  since
its output profile tends to match the demand. Peak load electricity from fossil fuels
tends  to  be  the  least  energy  efficient,  most  expensive  and  most  polluting,  because
utilities tend to operate their best plants first. As a distributed form of energy, solar
can help offset the peak demand from polluting sources with zero emissions. Experts
therefore expect that solar will act as a contributor to the overall mix of energy, but
that we will still need to rely on coal, nuclear and gas generation.

THE TEN CONTESTS

Architecture (200 points)

Teams  are  required  to  design  and  build  attractive,  high-performance  houses  that
integrate  solar  and  energy  efficiency  technologies  seamlessly  into  the  homes’  de-
signs. Scoring well in Architecture is crucial; teams can earn up to 200 points, twice
the number of points available in the other contests.
Dwelling (100 points)

Experts  from  the  residential  buildings  industry  will  award  points  based  on  their
evaluations  of  the  ‘‘livability’’  and  ‘‘buildability’’  of  the  homes.  Are  the  spaces  de-
signed  well  for  everyday  living—doing  laundry  and  getting  work  done?  Are  the
houses comfortable to live in and simple to care for? Are the houses’ features easily
reproducible? And would the houses attract buyers?
Documentation (100 points)

The Documentation contest awards points based on how well the teams analyzed
their  designs  for  energy  performance  and  how  thoroughly  they  documented  the  de-
sign  process.  Teams  must  document  all  stages,  including  the  schematic  design,  de-
sign development, construction, and ‘‘as-built’’ phases of the Solar Decathlon project.
Communications (100 points)

Panels of judges with expertise in communications and public relations will judge
the teams’ Web sites and house tours and award points based on the success of the
teams  in  delivering  clear  and  consistent  messages  and  images  that  represent  the
teams’ visions and results.
Comfort Zone (100 points)

Teams  will  be  judged  on  their  ability  to  provide  interior  comfort  in  their  houses
by controlling temperature and humidity. Full points will be rewarded for maintain-
ing  narrow  temperature  and  relative  humidity  ranges  inside  their  houses.  The
teams will also be judged on indoor environmental and air qualities.
Appliances (100 points)

The Appliance contest is designed to replicate appliance energy use in the average
American  home  in  the  United  States,  where  appliances  account  for  20%  of  energy
use.  To  earn  points,  student  teams  must  maintain  a  certain  temperature  in  their
refrigerators  and  freezers,  wash  and  dry  clothing,  cook  meals,  use  a  dishwasher  to
clean the dishes, as well as leave the television on for six hours a day and the com-
puter on for eight hours a day.
Hot Water (100 points)

Teams  can  score  points  in  the  Hot  Water  contest  by  successfully  completing  the
‘‘shower  tests,’’  which  entails  delivering  15  gallons  of  hot  water  in  10  minutes  or
less.  They  will  also  be  judged  on  how  innovative  the  hot  water  system  is,  and  the
system’s  ability  to  deliver  sufficient  hot  water  throughout  the  year,  including  when
guests visit.
Lighting (100 points)

Teams  can  score  points  in  numerous  ways,  but  this  contest  judges  the  amount  of
illumination supplied by both electric lights and daylighting. Lighting levels in each
room  of  a  team’s  house  are  continuously  monitored  and  recorded.  If  a  house  main-
tains  lighting  levels  within  an  optimal  range,  full  points  are  awarded.  Teams  can
also  earn  points  from  a  panel  of  judges  that  will  subjectively  evaluate  the  teams’
lighting  designs,  which  are  required  to  integrate  both  electric  and  natural  light,
from both a functional and an aesthetic standpoint.
Energy Balance (100 points)

Energy Balance will be scored by measuring the amount of energy going into the
batteries  from  the  solar  electric  system  and  the  amount  of  electrical  energy  being
drawn  from  the  batteries  to  meet  the  houses’  electrical  needs.  Teams  earn  full
points  if  their  battery  systems  have  as  much  stored  energy  at  the  end  of  the  com-
petition as they did at the beginning.
Getting Around (100 points)

In  the  Getting  Around  contest,  student  teams  use  electricity  generated  by  their
solar  electric  systems  to  ‘‘fuel’’  their  street-legal,  commercially  available  electric  ve-

hicles. Teams then must log as many miles as they can—based on how much ‘‘extra’’
energy they have generated. Points will be awarded based on how many miles each
team is able to drive.

Chairwoman  BIGGERT.  Good  afternoon.  The  hearing  of  the  En-

11

ergy Subcommittee of the Science Committee will come to order.

I will recognize myself for an opening statement for five minutes.
In  mid-October,  18  teams  of  undergraduate  and  graduate  stu-
dents  from  universities  across  the  country  assembled  on  the  Na-
tional  Mall  to  demonstrate  something  amazing.  After  two  years  of
work,  they  gathered  in  our  nation’s  capital  to  demonstrate  how  a
home  could  be  powered  entirely  by  solar  energy.  These  students
and  their  projects  faced  some  serious  challenges.  After  nearly  two
months  baking  in  the  sun,  the  Washington  area  received  its  first
measurable rainfall on the opening day of the decathlon.

While  I  was  not  down  in  Washington  at  the  time,  I  understand
it was cloudy and rainy just about every day thereafter through the
last  day  of  the  event.  We  were  back  in  our  Districts  at  the  time,
and we had no rain in the Chicago area, but it really was a deluge
here.  Now  that  kind  of  weather  isn’t  so  uncommon  in  Illinois,  and
during  the  winters  in  Chicago,  we  can  sometimes  go  for  weeks
without seeing the sun.

But despite the conditions, the teams persevered, and their tech-
nologies  worked,  for  the  most  part,  and  they  needed  to  work  in
order to demonstrate the viability of solar power in places like Chi-
cago  in  the  wintertime.  In  the  end,  the  projects  were  evaluated
based  on  ten  different  criteria,  many  of  the  same  criteria  that
Americans use to evaluate their choices when buying a home.

Today,  we  are  going  to  hear  from  some  of  the  winners  of  the
2005  Solar  Decathlon  as  they  show-and-tell  us  about  the  homes
they  designed  and  built  for  the  decathlon.  We  hope  to  have  some
fun  here,  but  we  also  want  to  engage  these  teams  of  young  sci-
entists and engineers in a serious conversation about the potential
for solar energy in this country.

As the Chairman of the Subcommittee and a member of the Edu-
cation Committee, I am especially pleased about the number of stu-
dents actively involved in the Decathlon and in this important dia-
logue today. I think it is safe to say that the Members of this sub-
committee  are  very  much  looking  forward  to  learning  more  from
you.

We  hope  that  you  will  talk  today  about  the  kinds  of  technology
and designs you used. We hope you will share with us what obsta-
cles  you  believe  must  still  be  overcome  before  the  Nation  can  ben-
efit  from  the  widespread  use  of  passive  and  active  solar-thermal
systems,  photovoltaic,  solar  energy,  and  on-site  energy  storage,
both electrical and thermal.

Finally,  we  hope  you  will  discuss  the  benefits  of  a  competition
such  as  the  Solar  Decathlon  and  about  what  we  can  do,  as  policy-
makers,  to  move  more  solar  and  efficiency  technologies  into  the
mainstream building market.

By  2025,  our  demand  for  energy  is  expected  to  grow  by  50  per-
cent,  and  energy  for  our  buildings  will  drive  a  significant  portion
of  that  demand.  Today,  buildings  alone  use  B  of  our  total  domestic
energy and 40 percent of our electricity. Solar energy has many ad-
vantages, and I know you will talk about that. And I think we are
really  optimistic  about  this  competition  as  young  scientists,  engi-
neers,  and  architects,  the  future  builders  of  America  learn  about
the  latest  energy  technologies.  They  learn  to  work  together  to  bal-

ance  aesthetics  with  energy  utility  to  make  their  homes  attractive
to the average buyer. And finally, they inspire their peers, the pub-
lic, and policy-makers to think in new ways about how we use our
energy. This is the kind of inspiration the Nation needs as we con-
tinue to confront a variety of energy challenges.

So  again,  let  me  extend  a  special  thanks  to  the  exceptional  stu-
dents, as well as their faculty advisors, for participating in the De-
cathlon and for joining us here today.

I  also  want  to  welcome  our  witness  from  the  Department  of  En-
ergy.  The  Department  is  to  be  commended  for  partnering  with  the
National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory,  the  American  Institute  of
Architects, the National Association of Home Builders, BP, the Do-
It-Yourself Network, and Sprint to host the Decathlon.

We look forward to the testimony of all witnesses today.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN JUDY BIGGERT

Good  afternoon,  and  welcome  to  this  Energy  Subcommittee  hearing  on  the  2005

Solar Decathlon, and the winning technologies previewed at that event.

In  mid-October,  18  teams  of  undergraduate  and  graduate  students  from  univer-
sities across the country assembled on the National Mall to demonstrate something
amazing.  After  two  years  of  work,  they  gathered  in  our  nation’s  capital  to  dem-
onstrate how a home could be powered entirely by solar energy.

These students and their projects faced some serious challenges. After nearly two
months  baking  in  the  sun,  the  Washington  area  received  its  first  measurable  rain-
fall on the opening day of the decathlon. While I was not in Washington at the time,
I  understand  it  was  cloudy  and  rainy  just  about  every  day  thereafter  through  the
last day of the event.

Now, that kind of weather isn’t so uncommon in my home State of Illinois. During

winters in Chicago, we sometimes go for weeks without seeing the sun.

So despite the conditions, the teams persevered and their technologies worked, for
the  most  part.  And  they  needed  to  work  in  order  to  demonstrate  the  viability  of
solar  power  in  places  like  Chicago  in  the  wintertime.  In  the  end,  the  projects  were
evaluated  based  on  10  different  criteria,  many  of  the  same  criteria  that  Americans
use to evaluate their choices when buying a home.

Today, we’re going to hear from some of the winners of the 2005 Solar Decathlon,
as they ‘‘show-and-tell’’ us about the homes they designed and built for the Decath-
lon.  We  hope  to  have  some  fun  here,  but  we  also  want  to  engage  these  teams  of
young  scientists  and  engineers  in  a  serious  conversation  about  the  potential  for
solar energy in this country.

As  the  Chairman  of  this  subcommittee  and  a  Member  of  the  Education  Com-
mittee,  I  am  especially  pleased  about  the  number  of  students  actively  involved  in
the  Decathlon,  and  in  this  important  dialogue  today.  I  think  it  is  safe  to  say  that
the Members of this subcommittee are very much looking forward to learning more
from  you.  We  hope  you  will  talk  today  about  the  kinds  of  technologies  and  designs
you  used.  We  hope  you  will  share  with  us  what  obstacles  you  believe  must  still  be
overcome  before  the  Nation  can  benefit  from  the  widespread  use  of  passive  and  ac-
tive solar thermal systems, photovoltaic solar electricity, and on-site energy storage,
both electrical and thermal. Finally, we hope you will discuss the benefits of a com-
petition  such  as  the  Solar  Decathlon  and  about  what  we  can  do,  as  policy-makers,
to help move solar and efficiency technologies into the mainstream building market.
By  2025,  our  demand  for  energy  is  expected  to  grow  by  50  percent,  and  energy
for  our  buildings  will  drive  a  significant  portion  of  that  demand.  Today,  buildings
alone use one-third of our total domestic energy and forty percent of our electricity.
Solar  energy  has  many  advantages:  it’s  made  in  America,  non-polluting,  abundant,
and  easy  to  build  and  permit.  If  we  could  produce  just  a  fraction  of  the  power  for
our  buildings  from  the  sun  and,  at  the  same  time,  reduce  our  total  energy  demand
by using smarter technologies and designs, the impact on our energy outlook would
be tremendous.

That  is  why  we  are  so  optimistic  about  this  competition.  Young  scientists,  engi-
neers, and architects—the future builders of America—learn about the latest energy
technologies.  They  learn  to  work  together  to  balance  aesthetics  with  energy  utility
to  make  their  homes  attractive  to  the  average  buyer.  Finally,  they  inspire  their

peers,  the  public,  and  policy-makers  to  think  in  new  ways  about  how  we  use  our
energy.  This  is  the  kind  of  inspiration  the  Nation  needs  as  we  continue  to  confront
a variety of energy challenges.

So  again,  let  me  extend  our  special  thanks  to  the  exceptional  students,  as  well
as  their  faculty  advisors,  for  participating  in  the  Decathlon  and  for  joining  us  here
today. I also want to welcome our witness from the Department of Energy. The De-
partment  is  to  be  commended  for  partnering  with  the  National  Renewable  Energy
Laboratory,  the  American  Institute  of  Architects,  the  National  Association  of  Home
Builders, BP, the D.I.Y. Network, and Sprint to host the Decathlon.

We look forward to the testimony of all the witnesses here today. With that, I will
yield  to  the  Subcommittee’s  Ranking  Member,  Mr.  Honda,  for  his  opening  state-
ment.

Chairwoman  BIGGERT.  And  with  that,  I  yield  to  the  Subcommit-

tee’s Ranking Member, Mr. Honda, for his opening statement.

Mr. HONDA. Thank you, Madame Chairwoman.
And  just  out  of  curiosity  in  the  audience,  how  many  of  these

graduate students are here, or students are here?

All  right.  There  are—we  have  got  women  on  there,  too.  Some  of
our folks say are there any women out there? I say I am sure there
are, you know.

And welcome to all of you. And Mr. Lyng, welcome to you.
And  Madame  Chairman,  thank  you  for  holding  this  hearing
today. I guess you call it the second biennium of the Solar Decath-
lon, and I wanted to thank the witnesses for being here today. And
it  is  especially  nice  to  have  the  students  here  with  us.  You  bring
a different perspective to us than our usual witnesses, because you
have a different perspective on life.

I  am  the  kind  of  person  that  bought  the  first  hybrid  car,  and
when  my  battery  didn’t  work  completely  well  that  kicks  over  the
engine, I put a solar panel on the back to see if I could keep the—
my battery alive until they figured out the glitch in my car.

But as a nation, we have not followed that same line of thinking
in terms of using solar power for an alternative source. The United
States was once a leader in solar technology, and the first solar cell
that was produced that has produced a useful amount of electricity
was invented here. But the last year, only 11 percent of the photo-
voltaic generating capacity was manufactured here in this country,
and  our  track  record  at  installing  solar  generating  capacity  is
equally poor.

By the end of 2004, the United States installed photovoltaic gen-
erating capacity was only about equal to what a standard coal-fired
power  plant  produces,  or  approximately  0.04  percent  of  the  U.S.
electricity production.

We  have  fallen  behind  other  nations,  such  as  Germany  and
Japan,  which  saw  solar  installation  increase  as  a  result  of  mean-
ingful  incentive  programs.  And  I  guess  that  is  where  our  housing
developers come in where we can look at those areas.

But all is not lost. A quick glance at a solar resource map shows
that  most  of  the  United  States  has  far  greater  potential  for  solar
power than Germany, a nation that has succeeded in bringing solar
along with proper incentives.

This  means  that  the  United  States  has  tremendous  growth  po-
tential for solar energy. And my own State of California has taken
the lead with over 100 megawatts of installed grid capacity to date.
It  has  taken  a  commitment  to  get  to  this  point,  though,  because
a typical home photovoltaic system is not cheap to purchase nor to

install.  If  you  do  the  math  to  figure  out  how  much  the  electricity
costs, it turns out that it is still higher than the typical retail cost
for electricity, but I am willing to try it and put it on my roof.

That  is  why  we  need  federal  and  State  tax  incentives,  rebates,
and loan guarantees to help consumers make the decision to adopt
the  technology.  And  to  succeed,  this  cost  of  solar-produced  elec-
tricity  must  be  reduced.  Fortunately,  as  more  cells  are  manufac-
tured, the cost for photovoltaic modules has decreased five to seven
percent  per  year.  As  we  convince  more  consumers  to  make  choices
to install these systems, the prices will continue to decline, and the
cost  of  power  will  eventually  become  comparable  to  other  sources.
But we need to convince them to make that choice. And to do so,
we  need  to  show  them  that  solar  power  can  work,  even  if  it  isn’t
a  brilliantly  sunny  day  in  the  desert.  On  my  dashboard  here  and
at  home,  I  have  a  solar-powered,  what  do  you  call  those  things,
flashlight,  because  I  figured  as  long  as  the  sun  shines  through  it,
there  is  still  light,  at  least  three  or  four  or  five  hours  out  of  the
24,  I  still  have  batteries  that  will  produce  light  for  me.  So  I  am
ready for anything with my flashlight battery.

So  I  look  forward  to  listening  to  your  experiences  in  this  year’s
decathlon where the weather wasn’t much like that. And hopefully,
all of you who are here today will provide us the avenue and light
the  way  for  us.  And  just  to  be  a  little  corny,  to  paraphrase  that
song, you are the sunshine of our lives.
Thank you very much for being here.
Thank you, Madame Chair.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL M. HONDA

Madam  Chairwoman,  thank  you  for  holding  this  hearing  today  on  the  Solar  De-

cathlon.

Thanks to the witnesses for being here today. It is especially nice to have the stu-
dents  with  us.  You  bring  a  different  perspective  to  us  than  our  usual  witnesses  do.
I’m  the  kind  of  person  who  drives  a  hybrid  car  and  wants  to  keep  the  battery

charged with a solar cell when I don’t drive it for a while.

But  as  a  nation,  we  have  not  followed  that  same  line  of  thinking.  The  United
States  was  once  the  leader  in  solar  technologies.  The  first  solar  cell  that  produced
a useful amount of electricity was invented here.

But  last  year,  only  11  percent  of  the  photovoltaic  generating  capacity  was  manu-
factured here. And our track record at installing solar generating capacity is equally
poor.

By  the  end  of  2004,  the  United  States  installed  photovoltaic  generating  capacity
was  only  about  equal  to  what  a  standard  coal-fired  power  plant  produces,  or  ap-
proximately 0.04 percent of U.S. electricity production.

We  have  fallen  behind  other  nations,  such  as  Germany  and  Japan,  which  saw

solar installation increase as a result of meaningful incentive programs.

But  all  is  not  lost.  A  quick  glance  at  a  solar  resource  map  shows  that  most  of
the United States has far greater potential for solar power than Germany, a nation
that has succeeded in bringing solar along with the proper incentives.

This means that the United States has tremendous growth potential for solar en-
ergy.  My  own  State  of  California  is  taking  the  lead,  with  over  100  MW  of  installed
grid capacity to date.

It  has  taken  a  commitment  to  get  to  this  point,  though,  because  a  typical  home

So I look forward to hearing about your experiences in this year’s Decathlon, which
wasn’t like that.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good morning. I want to thank the witnesses for appearing before our committee
to  examine  the  research  and  policy  implications  of  the  2005  Solar  Decathlon  Com-
petition.

The  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  held  the  first  Solar  Decathlon  on  the  Na-
tional  Mall  in  2002  and  recently  held  its  second  competition  from  October  6–16th
of  this  year.  The  competition  was  developed  by  the  DOE’s  Office  of  Energy  Effi-
ciency  and  Renewable  Energy  in  partnership  with  the  National  Renewable  Energy
Lab  and  several  non-governmental  sponsors.  The  Decathlon  aims  to  encourage
young  people  to  pursue  careers  in  science  and  engineering  and  to  help  students
think creatively about how we use and conserve energy.

I  believe  one  of  the  most  valuable  attributes  of  the  competition  is  advancing  re-
search  and  development  of  energy  efficiency  and  energy  production  technologies  in
order to help the U.S. regain our technological competitive edge.

The  U.S.  was  once  the  leader  in  solar  technologies,  but  in  2004,  U.S.  companies
manufactured  only  11  percent  of  photovoltaics  available  worldwide.  In  1999,  Japan
surpassed  the  U.S.  as  the  global  manufacturing  leader  and  recently  Germany  has
also  moved  ahead.  Despite  our  staggering  position  in  both  manufacturing  and  in-
stalled  production  capacity,  I  believe  the  U.S.  has  tremendous  growth  potential  for
solar energy and must strive to integrate renewable and efficiency technologies into
the  building  market  for  more  consumer  to  understand  all  of  the  benefits  solar  en-
ergy  has  to  offer  both  economically  and  environmentally.  In  order  to  document  and
communicate  the  benefits  of  solar  technology  to  consumers,  with  the  hopes  of  re-
gaining  our  competitive  edge  in  the  global  market  place,  educational  competitions,
such  as  the  Solar  Decathlon,  help  spur  new  ideas  and  concepts  and  I  look  forward
to hearing from several participants who excelled in the competition this year.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member.
I  am  pleased  to  welcome  our  witnesses  to  today’s  Energy  Subcommittee  hearing.
My  District,  in  Dallas,  Texas,  would  greatly  value  the  technologies  showcased  in

the decathlon competition.

Energy efficiency, solar heating and cooling, solar thermal systems and electricity,

and improved solar energy storage are the wave of the future.

We  as  a  nation  must  decrease  our  dependence  on  coal  and  fossil  fuels.  These  en-
ergy  sources  are  limited  and  will  only  grow  more  expensive  and  supply  decreases
and demand increases.

I have been a consistent, strong advocate of more federal dollars being put toward
energy research. As a Texan, I understand the power and value of the energy indus-
try.

To  quote  Ralph  Waldo  Emerson,  ‘‘Build  a  better  mousetrap,  and  the  world  will
beat a path to your door.’’ Build a better method of capturing, generating and stor-
ing energy, and the world will beat a path to your door.

The  Science  Committee  should  take  a  more  proactive  role  in  encouraging  Con-
gress and the Administration to invest more in energy efficiency research and devel-
opment.

Witnesses,  many  of  you  represent  the  future  of  innovation  in  energy  research.

Once again, I welcome you and appreciate your contributions to today’s hearing.

Thank you, Madame Chairman. I yield back.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE DANIEL LIPINSKI

I  would  like  to  congratulate  all  of  you  and  your  teams  on  successfully  partici-
pating in the 2005 Solar Decathlon. This program is notable not just for the oppor-
tunities it provides to students, but also for exposing the general public to new and
innovative ways to increase energy efficiency.

Solar  power  holds  great  hope  as  an  energy  source  that  is  not  only  environ-
mentally-friendly,  but  also  helps  reduce  our  dependence  on  foreign  energy  sources,
especially oil. As we face sky-rocketing costs for natural gas to heat our homes this
winter, the work done in this competition is especially relevant.

I have been interested in the potential of solar power for more than 25 years. My
8th grade science fair project examined the future role of solar energy. As an exam-
ple, I built a radio powered by a photovoltaic cell.

Today  we  can  see  how  far  the  use  of  solar  energy  has  progressed  in  the  tremen-
dous work of these students in the Solar Decathlon. As an engineer myself, it is es-
pecially  fascinating  to  see  the  design  innovations  that  were  developed  and  used  in
these solar houses that also have real world applications.

I  know  that  this  is  not  easy  work,  and  I  applaud  everyone  who  has  put  the  time
and  effort  into  these  important  projects.  Just  as  my  science  project  helped  inspire
me to pursue an engineering degree, I hope that the Solar Decathlon inspires more
young  Americans  to  pursue  degrees  in  science  and  engineering.  For  the  continued
security  and  economic  success  of  America,  we  must  continue  to  do  all  we  can  to
maintain our technological competitive edge. This continues to be one of my highest
priorities in Congress and on the Science Committee.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. And at this time, I’d like to introduce our

witnesses.

First, on our left, is Richard Moorer. He is the Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Technology Development at the Office of Energy Effi-
ciency  and  Renewable  Energy  at  the  Department  of  Energy.  Next,
we  have  Bob  Schubert.  He  is  the  Associate  Dean  for  Research  and
Outreach and a Professor in the College of Architecture and Urban
Studies  at  Virginia  Polytechnic  Institute.  He  serves  as  the  Faculty
Coordinator  for  Virginia  Tech  team.  Jeff  Lyng  is  a  graduate  stu-
dent and the Team Project Manager for the University of Colorado,
team—the  overall  winner  in  the  Decathlon.  Jeff  is  completing  his
Master’s  degree  in  civil  engineering  and  the  building  systems  pro-
gram at Colorado. Jonathan Knowles is a Professor of Architecture
and  serves  as  a  Faculty  Advisor  to  the  Rhode  Island  School  of  De-

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  RICHARD  F.  MOORER,  DEPUTY  ASSIST-
ANT SECRETARY FOR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT, OFFICE
OF  ENERGY  EFFICIENCY  AND  RENEWABLE  ENERGY,  THE
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY
Mr.  MOORER.  Madame  Chair,  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  I
appreciate the opportunity to testify on the Solar Decathlon, a con-
test  that  originated  in  the  Department  of  Energy’s  Solar  Tech-
nology Program.

In October 2000, DOE issued a challenge to our nation’s colleges
and  universities  to  design,  build,  and  operate  the  most  livable,  en-
ergy-efficient,  completely  solar-powered  house  in  a  major  competi-
tion.  The  Solar  Decathlon  houses  had  to  provide  all  the  home  en-
ergy  needs  of  a  typical  family  of  six  using  only  the  power  of  the
sun.  The  winner  of  the  competition  would  be  the  team  that  best
blends  aesthetics  and  modern  conveniences  with  maximum  energy
production and optimal efficiency. The schools submitted proposals,
and  a  committee  of  DOE  and  National  Renewable  Energy  Labora-
tory experts in solar energy and energy efficient design selected 14
teams to compete in this contest.

The first Solar Decathlon took place from September 26 to Octo-
ber  the  6th,  2002,  on  the  National  Mall  in  Washington,  DC.  Each
team  received  $5,000  in  seed  money  from  DOE.  The  university
teams  had  to  raise  all  of  their  own  funds  to  purchase  materials,
transport,  and  build  their  house  on  the  National  Mall.  The  first
event  was  well  attended,  with  more  than  100,000  people  visiting
the  solar  village  on  the  Mall,  eager  to  see  the  pioneering  designs.
A second competition was held this year. A request for proposals
was issued in 2003, and 24 proposals were received. Twenty teams
were  selected,  and  each  entrant  then  had  two  years  to  assemble  a
multi-disciplinary  team,  raise  all  of  the  necessary  funding,  select
and procure materials, and design and build their house on campus
before transporting it to Washington, DC.

The  2005  Solar  Decathlon  was  held  from  October  6  through  the
16th.  This  year’s  designs  had  clearly  improved  over  the  2002  de-
signs. The attention to architectural detail, soundness of structural
engineering,  and  integration  of  energy  systems  surpassed  expecta-
tions  and  generated  excitement  to  the  over  120,000  visitors  that
walked through the village and toured the homes.

The  University  of  Colorado  repeated  as  the  overall  winner  this
year, followed by Cornell University in second place, and California
Polytechnic State University finishing third.

There  are  two  overarching  goals  of  this  competition.  The  first
goal is to encourage young people to pursue careers in science and
engineering  and  to  acquaint  college  students  in  science,  engineer-
ing,  and  architecture  with  solar  power  and  energy  efficiency  tech-
nologies.  The  contest  encourages  participating  students  to  think
creatively about the way we use our energy and to explore the ben-
efits of using renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies to
help maintain our lifestyles.

The  second  overarching  goal  is  to  encourage  consumers  to  use
solar  energy  and  energy-efficient  technologies.  Off-the-shelf  solar
technology  is  ready  today  to  provide  power  for  homes,  and  energy
efficiency  technologies  available  at  your  local  hardware  store  can
significantly  reduce  the  energy  homes  use.  Consumers  toured  the

18

homes and took part in workshops at the Solar Decathlon to learn
what  they  can  do  to  tap  solar  power  or  reduce  energy  use  in  their
own homes.

The  Solar  Decathlon  appears  to  be  a  good  way  to  promote  out-
reach.  All  of  the  teams  told  their  visitors  about  easy  ways  to  save
energy,  such  as  using  compact  fluorescent  lights  and  Energy  Star
appliances. The public also learned about solar energy systems, ra-
diant  floor  heating,  day  lighting  techniques,  and  new  building  ma-
terials, such as structural insulated panels, or SIPs.

To  help  educate  builders,  architects,  and  other  professionals  in
the  housing  industry,  DOE,  together  with  its  sponsors,  organized
a  ‘‘building  industry  day.’’  Builders  and  architects  were  invited  to
come  to  the  Solar  Decathlon  on  Friday,  October  the  7th,  for  work-
shops  and  guided  tours  specially  designed  to  encourage  technology
transfer.  Many  of  the  workshops  were  full  to  capacity  with  stand-
ing room only.

Subject to available funding, DOE intends the Solar Decathlon to
become  a  10-year,  biennial  effort  to  design  appealing,  energy-effi-
cient,  cost-competitive  solar  homes  for  all  household  energy  needs.
In addition, we hope to encourage a fully developed and refined set
of  design  and  cost  specifications  for  the  houses,  an  industry  better
prepared to produce and build similar designs, and an educate pub-
lic ready to accept them.

Based on lessons learned, DOE is going to make three major im-
provements to the Decathlon: first, tie the competition more closely
to  DOE’s  Solar  Program  goals  by  placing  greater  emphasis  on  sys-
tems  integration  and  cost-effectiveness;  second,  to  improve  public
outreach  to  communicate  the  benefits  of  these  technologies  to  a
wider  audience;  and  third,  to  provide  increased  federal  funding  to
enable  the  teams  to  design  and  develop  more  cost-competitive
structures.

Madame  Chair,  that  completes  my  prepared  statement,  and  I
would  be  happy  to  answer  any  questions  the  Subcommittee  might
have.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RICHARD F. MOORER

Madame  Chair,  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to
testify on the Solar Decathlon, a contest that originated in the Department of Ener-
gy’s (DOE) Solar Technology Program.
History of the Solar Decathlon

In October 2000, DOE issued a challenge to our nation’s colleges and universities
to design, build, and operate the most livable, energy-efficient, completely solar-pow-
ered  house  in  a  major  competition.  The  Solar  Decathlon  houses  had  to  provide  all
the  home  energy  needs  of  a  typical  family  of  six  using  only  the  power  of  the  sun.
The  winner  of  the  competition  would  be  the  team  that  best  blends  aesthetics  and
modern  conveniences  with  maximum  energy  production  and  optimal  efficiency.  The
schools submitted proposals, and a committee of DOE and National Renewable En-
ergy  Laboratory  experts  in  solar  energy  and  energy  efficient  design  selected  14
teams to compete in this contest.

The  first  Solar  Decathlon  took  place  from  September  26  to  October  6,  2002,  on
the  National  Mall  in  Washington,  DC.  Each  team  received  $5,000  in  seed  money
from DOE. The university teams had to raise all their own funds to purchase mate-
rials, transport and build their house on the National Mall. The first event was well
attended, with more than 100,000 people visiting the solar village on the Mall, eager
to  see  the  pioneering  designs.  Each  team’s  home  included  a  kitchen,  living  room,
bedroom,  bathroom,  and  home  office  space,  with  a  maximum  building  footprint  of
800 ft2 (74.3 m2), equivalent to a small apartment. Though they shared these com-

mon requirements, the home designs for this first-ever Solar Decathlon varied wide-
ly,  from  traditional  to  contemporary.  Beyond  sophisticated  energy  systems,  many
homes were beautifully finished and furnished inside and out, with thoughtful inte-
gration of design aesthetics, consumer appeal, and comfort.

As  the  name  implies,  the  Solar  Decathlon  is  an  event  in  which  each  team’s  per-
formance  is  evaluated  in  10  categories:  architecture,  dwelling,  documentation,  com-
munications, comfort zone, appliances, hot water, lighting, energy balance, and get-
ting around. There is a winner in each category, and an overall winner for the team
that  accumulates  the  most  points.  Each  participating  team  invested  a  tremendous
amount  of  time,  money,  passion,  and  creativity  into  this  competition.  Teams  were
composed of architects, engineers, designers, communicators, fundraisers, and build-
ers.  Some  teams  had  to  overcome  daunting  obstacles,  such  as  having  to  ship  the
entry  from  Puerto  Rico  by  boat,  or  having  a  section  of  the  home  fall  off  the  truck
en route.

The  overall  winner  of  the  2002  competition,  the  University  of  Colorado,  used  a
strategy  of  dependable  technologies.  Whereas  the  competition  encouraged  innova-
tion, the limited duration of the event left little room for equipment failures or sys-
tem  malfunctions,  which  many  other  teams  experienced.  The  Colorado  team  used
a  large  (7.5  kW)  photovoltaic  (PV)  array  and  designed  the  house  well  based  on  its
understanding  of  the  energy  flows,  having  performed  very  comprehensive  modeling
of  the  home.  The  University  of  Virginia  placed  second,  and  Auburn  University
placed third overall in the competition.

A  second  competition  was  held  in  2005.  A  request  for  proposals  was  issued  in
2003, and 24 proposals were received. Twenty teams were selected, including a team
from  the  University  of  Madrid  in  Spain  and  Concordia  University  in  Canada.  Each
entrant then had two years to assemble a multidisciplinary team, raise all necessary
funding,  select  and  procure  materials,  and  design  and  build  their  house  on  campus
before transporting it to Washington, DC. Two of the original twenty, the University
of Virginia and the University of Southern California, were unable to raise the nec-
essary support and dropped out of the competition.

The  2005  Solar  Decathlon  was  held  from  October  6–16.  The  2005  designs  had
clearly improved over the 2002 designs. The attention to architectural detail, sound-
ness of structural engineering, and integration of energy systems surpassed expecta-
tion and generated excitement to the over 120,000 visitors who walked through the
village and toured the homes. Again, the University of Colorado took first place, fol-
lowed  by  Cornell  University  in  second  place,  and  California  Polytechnic  State  Uni-
versity finishing third.
Goals

There are two overarching goals of the competition. The first goal is to encourage
young  people  to  pursue  careers  in  science  and  engineering  and  to  acquaint  college
students  in  science,  engineering  and  architecture  with  solar  power  and  energy  effi-
ciency  technologies.  The  contest  encourages  participating  students  to  think  cre-
atively about the way we use our energy and to explore the benefits of using renew-
able energy and energy efficiency technologies to help maintain our lifestyles.

The  Solar  Decathlon  has  attracted  students  to  learn  about  solar  energy  and  en-
ergy efficiency. Some of the schools recruited 50 or more students to join their Solar
Decathlon  teams.  Many  of  the  students  received  credit  for  their  work  in  addition
to  gaining  valuable  hands-on  learning.  The  students  also  gain  valuable  experience
to help them find jobs after graduation in the fields of energy research, engineering,
or design.

The second overarching goal is to encourage consumers to use solar energy and en-
ergy  efficiency  technologies.  Off-the-shelf  solar  technology  is  ready  today  to  provide
power for homes, and energy efficiency technologies available at your local hardware
store can significantly reduce the energy homes use. Consumers can tour the homes
and  take  part  in  workshops  at  the  Solar  Decathlon  to  learn  what  they  can  do  to
tap solar power or reduce energy use in their own homes.

The Solar Decathlon appears to be a good way to promote outreach. Over 120,000
visitors  toured  the  houses  this  year  and  learned  from  the  students  how  the  houses
were  designed  and  what  technologies  were  incorporated.  All  the  teams  told  their
visitors  about  easy  ways  to  save  energy,  such  as  using  compact  fluorescent  lights
and Energy Star appliances. The public also learned about solar energy systems, ra-
diant floor heating, day lighting schemes and new building materials such as struc-
tural insulated panels (SIPs).

To help educate builders, architects, and other professionals in the housing indus-
try,  DOE,  together  with  its  sponsors,  organized  a  ‘‘building  industry  day.’’  Builders
and  architects  were  invited  to  come  to  the  Solar  Decathlon  on  Friday,  October  7th

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 07:52 Mar 23, 2006 Jkt 024150 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\ENER05\110205\24150 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

for workshops and guided tours specially designed to encourage technology transfer.
Many of the workshops were full to capacity with standing room only.
2007 and Beyond

The  Department  believes  that  the  2002  and  2005  Solar  Decathlons  advanced  the
two  overarching  goals  described  above.  As  a  result,  Department  plans  to  hold  suc-
cessive  events  every  two  years,  with  the  next  event  in  2007,  subject  to  available
funding.

Based on lessons learned, DOE is going to make three major improvements to the
Solar  Decathlon:  1)  tie  the  competition  more  closely  to  DOE’s  solar  program  goals
by placing greater emphasis on system integration and cost effectiveness, 2) improve
public  outreach  to  communicate  the  benefits  of  these  technologies  to  a  wider  audi-
ence,  and  3)  provide  increased  federal  funding  to  enable  the  teams  to  design  and
develop more cost-competitive structures.

The Department believes that competitions such as the Solar Decathlon maximize
creativity  and  innovation,  and  generate  strong  motivation  and  interest.  The  Solar
Decathlon may also foster the technology transfer process. The competition provides
the  opportunity  for  aspiring  young  architects  and  engineers  to  be  creative,  innova-
tive,  and  design  and  develop  new  ideas.  The  empty  lot  provides  a  place  to  build,
to test, and to learn what works best.

Subject  to  available  funding,  DOE  intends  the  Solar  Decathlon  to  become  a  ten-
year,  biennial  effort  to  design  appealing,  energy  efficient,  cost-competitive  solar
houses  for  all  household  energy  needs:  heat  and  electricity.  In  addition,  we  hope  to
encourage a fully developed and refined set of design and cost specifications for the
houses,  an  industry  better  prepared  to  produce  and  build  similar  designs,  and  an
educated public ready to accept them.

DOE  conducted  a  survey  of  the  participating  2005  Solar  Decathlon  teams.  Most
teams  struggled  to  raise  funds  over  the  past  three  years  since  the  first  event  was
held,  with  two  dropping  out  due  to  lack  of  support.  In  response,  Secretary  Bodman
announced that the Department would increase its financial support for the 20 best
proposals  selected  through  a  competitive  process  from  $5k  to  $50K  per  year  over
two years, subject to available funding.
Technology Transfer

The  Solar  Decathlon  is  specifically  designed  to  help  teams  integrate  solar  energy
and energy efficient building technologies and practices into their designs. This was
accomplished  by  fully  involving  DOE’s  Solar  Program  and  Building  Technologies
program  in  Solar  Decathlon  team  activities  including  materials  development,  pre-
competition meetings, and contest design. In addition, the inclusion of sponsors like
the American Institute of Architects and BP Solar was intended to significantly im-
prove outreach capability with professional builders, architects and solar equipment
manufacturers in the U.S.

Specific  Solar  Decathlon  activities  were  designed  to  foster  technology  transfer  by
appealing  to  builders  and/or  to  consumers  intending  to  build  or  renovate  their
homes using solar and/or energy efficiency technologies. These included:

• Building  Industry  Day  on  October  7.  Builders  and  allied  trades  from  the
Washington  Metropolitan  area,  as  well  as  seven  nearby  states,  were  invited
to  participate  in  a  special  day  set  aside  for  builder-oriented  tours  of  the
homes and a series of technical workshops designed to help them understand
how  best  to  use  and  install  energy  efficient  products  and  solar  technologies
in building projects.

• A  series  of  workshops  geared  for  the  general  public  was  held  every  day  from
October  8–16  to  encourage  the  installation  and  use  of  energy  efficiency  and
solar  energy  technologies.  The  workshops  were  designed  to  help  consumers
understand  how  to  go  about  installing  these  technologies  in  their  homes  in
order to reduce their use of energy.

• A  concerted  media  outreach  campaign  about  the  Solar  Decathlon  was  under-
taken to provide in-depth information about the competition and about energy
efficiency  and  renewable  energy  technologies.  The  resulting  (and  continuing)
media  coverage  has  helped  the  public  understand  that  energy  efficiency  and
solar energy technologies are available off-the-shelf today and, when installed,
can significantly reduce home energy use.

• A  product  directory,  searchable  both  by  team  and  by  product  type  (windows,
appliances, solar panels, etc.), is prominently featured on the Solar Decathlon
web  site  home  page.  The  product  directory  is  designed  to  help  people  locate
the products and technologies featured in each of the Solar Decathlon homes.

• ‘‘The Anatomy of a House’’ educational exhibit was developed to help builders
and the public understand individual energy efficiency and solar energy tech-
nologies  (windows,  insulation,  solar  hot  water  technology,  etc.)  and  how  they
work  under  the  ‘‘skin’’  of  a  house.  Also  included  in  this  exhibit  was  an  inter-
active  display  explaining  how  net  metering  works  in  a  home  using  a  photo-
voltaic system connected to the utility grid.

And, finally, an unanticipated way in which these technologies can be moved into
the marketplace is through the students themselves. Several builders and business-
men,  impressed  by  the  skills  and  knowledge  of  the  Solar  Decathlon  students,  were
actively recruiting them for jobs.

Madame  Chair,  that  completes  my  prepared  statement,  and  I  would  be  happy  to

answer any questions the Subcommittee might have.

Mr.  Moorer  is  the  first  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  to  hold  this  position  which  was
created  on  July  1,  2002,  by  the  re-organization  of  the  Office  of  Energy  Efficiency
and Renewable Energy. In this position, Mr. Moorer has responsibility for the entire
energy efficiency and renewable energy portfolio, which is now organized into eleven
major program areas.

Prior  to  this  position,  Mr.  Moorer  was  the  Associate  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary
for Transportation Technologies. He was responsible for the Department of Energy’s
strategic  planning,  analysis  and  budget  development  on  efficient  automotive  sys-
tems and alternative fuels and for the development and implementation of the alter-
native  fuel  vehicle  provisions  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act.  Mr.  Moorer  also  served  as
the head of the Department’s Bioenergy Task Force.

Formerly, he was the Director of the Biofuels Systems Division (BSD) of the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE) Conservation and Renewable Energy Program’s Office
of  Transportation  Technologies.  He  was  responsible  for  the  management  and  over-
sight of the Department’s Biofuels Systems programs. These programs focus on the
research and development of innovative and economical processes that produce and
convert  biomass  feedstocks  to  alcohol  fuels,  biomass-based  gasoline  and  bio-diesel
fuel. In this position he developed the DOE Renewable Energy Transportation Fuels
Initiative.  In  addition,  he  was  instrumental  in  developing  the  transportation  tech-
nology section of the National Energy Strategy.

Mr.  Moorer  spent  12  years  working  on  advanced  conversion  processes  to  produce
alcohol  fuels  for  the  transportation  sector.  During  this  time,  he  conducted  several
feasibility  studies  on  biomass  alcohol  production  and  focused  the  efforts  of  the  De-
partment’s research and development efforts on the most promising conversion tech-
nologies.  Mr.  Moorer  also  served  as  Program  Manager  for  the  biochemical  conver-
sion  technology  program  with  the  Biofuels  and  Municipal  Waste  Technology

Mr. SCHUBERT. Madame Chair, before I start, I would like to ac-
knowledge  two  of  my  colleagues  that  have  joined  me:  Professors

Robert  Denae  and  Joe  Wheelard  directly  behind  me.  This  is  part
of the core team faculty advisors that produced this project.

Before we address the specific questions provided, we would like
to acquaint you with some aspects of our building produced for the
2005 Solar Decathlon competition.

The  Virginia  Tech  Solar  House  integrates  technology  and  archi-
tecture. The house achieved a balance between the two as reflected
by winning the juried competition elements of Architecture, Dwell-
ing, Daylighting, and tying for first place in Electric Lighting.

Some  of  the  key  features  included  an  efficient  plan.  The  house
is  comprised  of  a  small  580  square  foot  rectangular  plan  wrapped
on three sides with a translucent skin and covered with a hovering
curved roof inclined towards the sun.

A  floating  roof.  The  particular  shape  of  the  roof,  a  lightweight
stressed  skin,  folded-plate  filled  with  foam  insulation,  is  designed
to  set  the  solar  panels  at  an  optimum  angle  for  energy  collection
and integrates the panels into the roof form.

The  north  core  module.  A  thick  linear  core  defines  a  massive
north  wall  and  houses  the  batteries,  electrical,  and  mechanical
equipment, and serves functions such as the kitchen, laundry, stor-
age,  and  closets.  Constructed  of  expanded  polystyrene  panels  that
are  lightweight,  easily  assembled,  and  yield  a  high  insulation
value,  this  module  could  be  manufactured  separately  and  utilized
in many applications.

A  translucent  wall  assembly.  Two  layers  of  aerogel  filled
polycarbonate  panels  transmit  beautiful  diffused  light  while  deliv-
ering an extremely high insulation value. There will be no need for
electric lights from sunrise to sunset.

A tunable wall. Between the polycarbonate panels are three sys-
tems:  a  pair  of  reflective  and  absorptive  motorized  shades  allow
user  control  of  light  and  heat  transmission;  linear  actuated  vents
top and bottom provide ventilation for further thermal control; and,
dimmer controlled LED lights allow the user to make the wall any
color, no pain required.

Innovative  engineered  systems.  Our  energy-efficient  ground
source heat pumps powered by the solar electric panels provide en-
vironmental  conditioning  in  the  form  of  heating  and  cooling  while
delivering heat through a radiant floor that offers the best in terms
of  efficiency  and  quality.  There  is  little  air  noise  or  movement  and
the ambient temperature can be kept lower, saving energy.

Transportation. A lowboy chassis serving as the floor and founda-
tion  structure  was  designed  to  receive  a  detachable  gooseneck  and
rear  axles  for  transport.  A  truss  on  each  side  of  the  48-foot  span
reflects—resists deflection while in transit and rotates down 90 de-
grees to create a deck surrounding the house when stationary.

Now I would like to respond to the questions that were provided.
Some  of  the  main  technical  and  other  barriers  to  greater  use  of
solar  energy  are:  inertia  of  public  perception  towards  the  status
quo; perception of increased complexity of new systems versus con-
ventional  systems;  conservatism  of  building  industry  and  their  ad-
versity  to  risk;  cost,  time  of  return  on  investment;  and  there  are
few new architectural ideas relative to new technology.

Some suggestions for what might be done to overcome those bar-
riers  are:  increased  incentives  for  solar  installation,  such  as  tax

and mortgage incentives, low interest loans, and utility credits; cre-
ate  a  national  awards  program  for  solar  design;  encourage  numer-
ous  and  repetitive  small-scale  applications;  regional  centers  that
promote  the  use  of  solar  energy,  similar  to  agricultural  extension
programs, working in conjunction with state energy offices; require
utilities  to  generate  a  percentage  of  power  from  solar  energy;  fed-
eral  energy  subsidies  redirected  to  encourage  a  higher  percentage
of  renewable  energy;  in  addition  to  a  long—week-long  competition
on the Mall, recreate the solar village for a longer period in an expo
type of forum.

The  Solar  Decathlon  Competition  is  an  effective  means  to  seed
the potentials of solar energy in the public consciousness. It touch-
es  people  from  all  walks  of  life  and  from  diverse  economic  and  so-
cial  backgrounds.  As  witnessed  in  the  competition  of  2002  and
2005,  there  is  widespread  and  growing  public  interest  in  solar  en-
ergy.  Integral  with  the  competition,  all  aspects  of  the  house  are
considered  with  respect  to  conservation  of  energy.  Particularly  the
Virginia Tech house, demonstration was made that a solar dwelling
can offer a desirable and rich lifestyle.

Its competitive content activates top research universities to fur-
ther  their  research  efforts  and  to  draw  unique  collaborations  with
industry.

The Solar Decathlon of 2002 provided a wealth of information in
our  own  experience  of  designing  and  building  a  house  as  well  as
observing the houses from other research institutions.

Our  2005  house  integrates  the  research  from  the  previous  work
and  lessons  learned  from  other  houses.  In  addition  to  on-campus
expertise, a network of manufacturers and professionals having ties
to  Virginia  Tech  was  used  to  develop  and  refine  ideas.  And  an  ex-
tensive  student  network  researched  a  wide  range  of  materials,
processes, and technologies, some of which were integrated into our
design.

Two of the problems we encountered were: an inordinate amount
of  time,  energy,  and  cost  associated  with  our  transportation  strat-
egy;  percentage  of  time  utilized  to  raise  in-kind  donations  and  ex-
treme difficulty in raising cash contributions.

We  feel  our  house  would  be  commercially  viable,  placed  within
the  context  of  a  commercially  manufactured  housing.  Winning  the
Architecture and Dwelling Awards in the competition, the Virginia
Tech  house  demonstrated  its  appeal  to  a  discriminating  set  of
judges.  The  Virginia  Tech  Solar  House  offers  various  possibilities
for  components  that  will  conserve  energy  and  improve  the  quality
of residential building.

In conclusion, we would like to leave with this final thought.
We  approach  a  watershed.  Our  lifetime  has  experienced  an  in-
creased  dependence  on  technology.  Almost  every  amenity  we  enjoy
is  dependent  upon  centralized  systems  whose  working  and  control
are  far  removed  from  localized  areas.  A  short  curtailment  of  serv-
ices  sends  neighborhoods  and  regions  into  temporary  states  of
chaos.  In  the  recent  case  of  hurricane  damage,  available  supplies
of  gasoline  could  not  be  accessed  due  to  lack  of  electrical  service.
Whether from natural disaster or terrorist threat, large-scale tech-
nologies  have  exposed  growing  risks.  We  must  reduce  the  risk  of
widespread  technological  failure  by  providing  alternative  distrib-

Accompanied  by  Robert  Dunay,  Chair,  Industrial  Design  Program  and  Joseph

Wheeler, Lead Faculty Advisor, Solar Decathlon Project.
The Virginia Tech Solar House

The  Solar  Decathlon  of  2002  was  an  educational  watershed  challenging  the  rela-
tion  between  academia  and  practice  and  between  research  and  its  corresponding
contribution  to  society.  The  knowledge  derived  from  the  2002  competition  has  been
integrated  into  the  Virginia  Tech  house  of  2005  to  produce  a  work  that  combines
innovative  technology  and  daily  life  styles.  This  new  project  has  achieved  a  high
level  of  complexity  expressed  in  an  elegant  simplicity.  The  initial  theme  of  the  art
of integration has been realized through a design of a solar house that demonstrates
a  comfortable  living  and  working  environment,  excellence  in  sustainable  construc-
tion, and strong architectonic expression. The project presents forms that look to the
future embodied with a sense of the sustainable and the beautiful.
Mission

The  mission  of  the  Virginia  Tech  Solar  Decathlon  Team  is  to  inform  and  educate
the  public  about  issues  of  energy  (particularly  solar)  and  to  give  students  energy  ex-
pertise through a design-build process of innovative research and testing through ap-
plication.

Our multi-disciplinary team strives to achieve the following goals:

illustrate the energy consumption of daily activities.

• To  illustrate  how  solar  energy  can  improve  the  quality  of  life.  Solar
energy is clean; it significantly reduces pollutant emissions; and solar
energy is renewable, thereby increasing our nation’s energy security.
• To  make  the  public  aware  of  how  energy  is  used  in  their  daily  lives,  and  to
• To  demonstrate  that  market-ready  technologies  exist  that  can  meet  the  en-
• To  demonstrate  that  sustainable  materials  and  technologies  can  comprise  a
• To  examine  a  project  in  a  prototypical  manner  to  develop  solutions  that  can
be reproduced and realized through manufacturing techniques with economic
benefit.
• To challenge conventional practice through interdisciplinary collaboration and

ergy requirements of our daily activities by tapping into the sun’s power.

• Inertia of public perception towards the status quo
• Perception of increased complexity of new system vs. conventional systems
• Conservatism of building industry and their adversity to risk
• Cost—time of return on investment
• There are few new architectural ideas relative to new technology

• Regional centers that promote the use of solar energy (similar to agricultural

extension programs) working in conjunction with state energy offices

produce a wall that delivers great light and high insulation. Likewise, collabo-
ration with California Closets has the corporation, for the first time, building
cabinet prototypes from a Dow Chemical wheat board that is sustainable and
non detrimental to the environment.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you very much.
And now, Mr. Lyng, you are recognized.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  JEFFREY  R.  LYNG,  GRADUATE  STUDENT
AND  TEAM  PROJECT  MANAGER,  CIVIL,  ENVIRONMENTAL,
AND ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING, UNIVERSITY OF COLO-
RADO
Mr. LYNG. Madame Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee
on  Energy,  on  behalf  of  the  University  of  Colorado,  I  would  like  to
thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.

I would also like to acknowledge the U.S. Department of Energy,
the  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory,  and  each  of  the  con-
test  sponsors  for  their  work  in  fostering  the  Solar  Decathlon  and
their  commitment  to  improving  the  future  of  energy.  Most  impor-
tantly,  I  would  like  to  recognize  all  of  the  2005  Solar  Decathlon
teams,  especially  those  not  represented  here  today,  for  their  un-
wavering dedication to energy.

I  am  here  today  to  give  you  a  fresh  perspective  as  a  young  pro-
fessional  in  the  renewable  energy  industry,  but  more  importantly
as  a  fellow  Solar  Decathlete.  I  am  here  to  tell  the  story  of  a  new
generation of solar patriots.

For  student  competitors,  the  Solar  Decathlon  offers  a  learning
experience rarely seen in academia. These design/build projects are
training  a  highly  skilled  workforce  able  to  do  more  with  less.  The
Solar  Decathlon  embodies  much  more  than  job  training,  however.
It  symbolizes  a  sincere  effort  on  the  part  of  students,  teachers,  in-
dustry  professionals,  and  government  leaders  to  solve  some  of  the
most immediate energy production problems facing our world. Fur-
thermore, it symbolizes the empowerment of a new generation.

I could continue on with accolades about the competition and de-
scribe  for  you  how  powerful  it  was  to  participate  in  a  demonstra-
tion  of  solar  energy  during  a  week  of  overcast  weather  or  how  in-
spiring  it  was  to  see  over  120,000  visitors  on  the  National  Mall.
But that is not why we are here. We are here because we acknowl-
edge  the  potential  of  the  Solar  Decathlon  competition  to  spark  in-
novation,  ingenuity,  and  change.  We  also  recognize  that  the  com-
petition  can  be  improved.  Through  mutual  collaboration  and  our
discussions  here  today,  I  hope  that  we  can  tailor  this  competition
to  more  closely  address  the  mounting  concerns  of  energy  cost  and
reliability that the mainstream homeowner is faced with every day.
Having  devoted  the  past  three  years  of  my  life  to  the  CU  Solar
Decathlon Project and spoken with thousands of people who toured
the  Bio-S(h)IP  during  the  week  of  the  competition,  I  am  excited  to
participate in your efforts to strengthening it. I would like to share
with  you  three  personal  observations  of  my  experiences  which  ad-
dress  the  questions  outlined  for  our  discussion  and  offer  solutions
within the context of the Solar Decathlon competition.

Observation  one:  some  visitors  undoubtedly  walked  away  from
the  competition  misinformed  about  solar  energy.  For  many  mem-
bers  of  the  public,  the  Solar  Decathlon  was  their  first  introduction
for  solar—to  solar  energy.  This  misinformation  was  not  due  to  a
lack  of  knowledge  or  enthusiasm  on  the  part  of  the  Solar
Decathletes.  It  was  the  result  of  a  fundamental  flaw,  I  believe,  of
the competition: the need to be off-grid.

For  many  visitors,  their  impressions  of  solar  technology  from
touring  the  homes  are  that  it  requires  huge  battery  banks,  should
cover every square foot of your home, and probably requires hiring
someone  to  staff  your  mechanical  room  24/7.  I  believe  that
transitioning  the  competition  from  a  stand-alone  application  to  a
grid-tied  application  with  smaller  arrays,  little,  if  any,  on-site  en-
ergy  storage,  and  net  metering  on  each  house  can  only  result  in
homes more closely aligned with what the typical consumer can ac-
tually expect to live in.

Observation  two:  while  the  competition  is  a  great  showcase  for
individual  technologies  and  products,  it  is  not  a  great  showcase  of
integrated building approaches. Shortly after returning to Colorado
from the decathlon competition, I spent three days at a builder con-
ference attended by many production homebuilders. I felt like I had
gone  from  one  end  of  the  residential  building  spectrum  to  the
other. It could be argued that CU Solar Decathlon house is perhaps
the most custom home in the State of Colorado right now, and like-
wise  for  the  other  homes  in  their  Districts.  In  the  design  process,
we pushed the last percentage point of efficiency for maximum en-
ergy production. Contrast that with the production home market in
which  an  unfortunate  number  of  products  are  right  now  being  de-
signed and built all around the country with no regard to the bene-
fits  of  an  east-west  solar  orientation  or  the  advantages  of  building
homes even slightly above current energy code.

It  is  tragic  to  think  that  none  of  the  18  homes  that  were  show-
cased  on  the  National  Mall  last  month  might  ever  be  built.  There
exists  an  inherent  and  ever-widening  disconnect  between  the
homes Solar Decathletes give form to and the realities that the pro-
duction  home  market  in  the  United  States  provide.  I  believe  that
the  competition  falls  short  of  offering  real  solutions  to  how  these
homes  can  be  incorporated  into  the  large  subdivisions.  We  must
find ways to facilitate energy efficient and solar technology transfer
from the Solar Decathlon competition to the production home mar-
ket if we aspire to appeal to the average home buyer.

Observation  three:  the  true  economic  viability  of  each  home  is
not well understood. Perhaps the biggest surprise for me was the—
through  this  entire  process  was  how  much  of  my  time  was  con-
sumed  in  fundraising.  There  was  a  talk  of  pulling  the  plug  this
spring and a very real concern that the defending champions would
not be able to compete due to lack of funding.

The  CU  Solar  Decathlon  team’s  budget  for  the  2005  project  was
$500,000. Assuming a comparable budget for all teams in 2007, the
$100,000 pledge to each competing university from the DOE leaves
a  substantial  80  percent  cost  sharing  on  the  part  of  students  par-
ticipating. That level of fundraising can distort design.

Alleviating the burden of fundraising would have several positive
ramifications. It would increase the quality of each design. It would

29

ensure a more objective approach to showcasing only the best tech-
nologies.  And  it  would  provide  a  means  for  accurate  accounting  of
the true retail cost of each home.

The Solar Decathlon competition must not be perceived as a nov-
elty  or  political  distraction.  It  must  play  a  supporting  role  in  cre-
ating  a  new  future  of  energy  if  we  are  to  achieve  what  Richard
Nixon  was  referring  to  in  1973  when  he  said,  ‘‘Let  us  set  as  our
national goal, in the spirit of Apollo, with the determination of the
Manhattan Project, that by the end of this decade we will have de-
veloped  the  potential  to  meet  our  own  energy  needs  without  de-
pending upon any foreign energy source.’’

Thirty  years  later,  we  can  all  agree  we  didn’t  make  it.  But  why
didn’t  we  make  it?  We  didn’t  get  to  the  Moon  by  encouraging  col-
lege students to build bottle rockets on the National Mall.

Achieving  energy  independence  will  take  much  more  than  just
collaborative  efforts  on  the  part  of  students,  builders,  researchers,
and policymakers to bring this to fruition. It will take federal lead-
ership beyond these collaborations to make it happen.

Each  Solar  Decathlete  is  doing  their  part  in  keeping  the  candle
lit  for  solar  energy.  It  is  now  time  for  Members  of  this  committee
and all Members of Congress to lead the way in carrying the torch.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JEFFREY R. LYNG

Madam Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee on Energy:

On  behalf  of  the  University  of  Colorado  College  of  Architecture  &  Planning  and
College of Engineering and Applied Science, I would like to thank you for the oppor-
tunity to speak with you today.

I would like to acknowledge the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Renew-
able Energy Laboratory, and each of the contest sponsors for their work in fostering
the Solar Decathlon and their commitment to improving the future of energy. Most
importantly,  I  would  like  to  recognize  all  of  the  2005  Solar  Decathlon  teams,  espe-
cially those not represented here today, for their unwavering dedication to solar en-
ergy.

I  am  here  today  to  give  you  a  fresh  perspective  as  a  young  professional  in  the
renewable  energy  industry,  but  more  importantly  as  fellow  Solar  Decathlete.  I’m
here to tell the story of a new generation of solar patriot.

For  student  competitors,  the  Solar  Decathlon  offers  a  learning  experience  rarely
seen in academia. These design/build projects are training a highly skilled workforce
able to do more with less. The Solar Decathlon embodies much more than job train-
ing, however. It symbolizes a sincere effort on the part of students, teachers, indus-
try  professionals  and  government  leaders  to  solve  some  of  the  most  immediate  en-
ergy  production  problems  facing  our  world.  Furthermore,  it  symbolizes  the  em-
powerment of a new generation.

I could continue on with accolades about the competition and describe for you how
powerful  it  was  to  participate  in  a  demonstration  of  solar  energy  during  a  week  of
overcast  weather  or  how  inspiring  it  was  to  see  over  120,000  visitors  on  the  Na-
tional  Mall.  But  that’s  not  why  we’re  here.  We  are  here  because  we  acknowledge
the potential of the Solar Decathlon competition to spark innovation, ingenuity, and
change.  We  also  recognize  that  the  competition  can  be  improved.  Through  mutual
collaboration  and  our  discussion  here  today  I  hope  that  we  can  tailor  this  competi-
tion  to  more  closely  address  the  mounting  concerns  of  energy  cost  and  reliability
that the mainstream home owner is faced with every day.

Having devoted the past three years of my life to the CU Solar Decathlon Project
and spoken with thousands of people who toured the CU Bio-S(h)IP during the week
of  the  competition,  I  am  excited  to  participate  in  your  efforts  to  strengthening  it.
I  would  like  to  share  with  you  three  personal  observations  from  my  experiences
which  address  the  questions  outlined  for  our  discussion  and  offer  solutions  within
the context of the Solar Decathlon competition.

1. Some  visitors  undoubtedly  walked  away  from  the  competition  mis-

informed about solar energy.
For many members of the public, the Solar Decathlon was their first introduction
to  solar  energy.  This  misinformation  was  not  due  to  a  lack  of  knowledge  or  enthu-
siasm  on  the  part  of  Solar  Decathletes.  It  was  the  result  of  a  fundamental  flaw  of
the competition; the need to be off-grid.

For  many  visitors,  their  impressions  of  solar  technology  from  touring  the  homes
are that it requires huge battery banks, should cover every square foot of your roof
and probably requires hiring someone to staff your mechanical room 24/7 to operate
it.  I  believe  that  transitioning  the  competition  from  a  stand-alone  application  to  a
grid-tied application with smaller arrays, little if any on-site energy storage and net
metering  on  each  house  can  only  result  in  homes  more  closely  aligned  with  what
the typical consumer can actually expect to live in.

I am exceedingly proud of the CU Team for winning the Communications contest.
We  invested  thousands  of  hours  into  streamlining  our  messaging  to  the  public,  yet
that  message  was  still  sometimes  misconstrued.  We  must  fix  this  problem  of  grid
interconnectedness  before  the  2007  event  if  the  public  is  to  comprehend  the  true
merits of solar energy or else run the risk of leaving the wrong impression.
2. While  the  competition  is  a  great  showcase  for  individual  technologies
and  products,  it  is  not  a  great  showcase  of  integrated  building  ap-
proaches.
I’d  like  to  share  with  you  my  experiences  this  past  week.  Shortly  after  returning
to  Colorado  from  the  Solar  Decathlon  competition,  I  spent  three  days  at  a  builder
conference well attended by many production home builders. I felt like I’d gone from
one end of the residential building spectrum to another. It could be argued that the
CU  Solar  Decathlon  house  is  perhaps  the  most  custom  home  in  the  State  of  Colo-
rado  right  now,  and  likewise  for  each  of  the  other  homes  in  their  respective  states.
In  the  design  process,  we  pushed  the  last  percentage  point  of  efficiency  for  max-
imum  energy  production.  Contrast  that  with  the  production  home  market  in  which
an  unfortunate  number  of  products  are  right  now  being  designed  and  built  all
around  the  country  with  no  regard  to  the  benefits  of  an  east-west  solar  orientation
or the advantages of building homes even slightly above current energy code.

It  is  tragic  to  think  that  none  of  the  18  homes  that  were  showcased  on  the  Na-
tional Mall last month might ever be built again. There exists an inherent and ever-
widening  disconnect  between  the  homes  Solar  Decathletes  give  form  to  and  the  re-
alities of the production home market in the U.S. I believe that the competition falls
short  of  offering  real  solutions  to  how  these  homes  can  be  incorporated  into  the
large  subdivisions.  We  must  find  ways  to  facilitate  energy  efficient  and  solar  tech-
nology  transfer  from  the  Solar  Decathlon  competition  to  the  production  home  mar-
ket if we aspire to appeal to the average home buyer.
3. The true economic viability of each home is not well understood.

Perhaps  the  biggest  surprise  for  me  through  this  entire  process  was  how  much
of  my  time  was  consumed  by  fundraising.  There  was  talk  of  ‘‘pulling  the  plug’’  this
spring  and  a  very  real  concern  that  the  defending  champions  would  not  be  able  to
compete due to lack of funding.

The CU Solar Decathlon Team’s budget for the 2005 project was $500,000. Assum-
ing  a  comparable  budget  for  all  teams  in  2007,  the  $100,000  pledge  to  each  com-
peting university from the DOE leaves a substantial 80 percent cost sharing on the
part of the students participating. That level of fundraising can distort design.

Alleviating  the  burden  of  fundraising  would  have  several  positive  ramifications.
1. It  would  increase  the  quality  of  each  design  by  allowing  teams  to  devote
more  time  to  the  design  and  construction  phases,  rather  than  fundraising.
2. It would ensure a more objective approach to showcasing only the best tech-
nologies, rather than simply those products that teams are able to secure do-
nations for.

3. It  would  provide  a  means  for  accurate  accounting  of  the  true  retail  cost  of
the  each  home  by  eliminating  the  guess  work  associated  with  product  dona-
tion.

I  also  recommend  abandoning  the  Energy  Balance  contest  for  a  Life-Cycle  Cost
contest  in  which  teams  compete  to  build  the  least  expensive  home  to  construct  and
operate. This would be very possible under a net-metering scenario.

The  Solar  Decathlon  competition  must  not  be  perceived  as  a  novelty  or  political
distraction.  It  must  play  a  supporting  role  in  creating  a  new  future  of  energy  use
if we are to achieve what Richard Nixon was referring to in 1973 when he said, ‘‘Let

Manhattan Project, that by the end of this decade we will have developed the poten-
tial  to  meet  our  own  energy  needs  without  depending  upon  any  foreign  energy

Thirty  years  later,  we  can  all  agree  that  we  didn’t  make  it.  But  why  didn’t  we
make  it?  We  didn’t  get  to  the  Moon  by  encouraging  college  students  to  build  bottle
rockets on the National Mall.

Achieving  energy  independence  will  take  more  than  just  collaborative  efforts  on
the  part  of  students,  builders,  researchers,  and  policy-makers  to  bring  to  fruition.
It will take federal leadership beyond these collaborations to make it happen.

Each  Solar  Decathlete  is  doing  their  part  in  keeping  the  candle  lit  for  solar  en-
ergy.  It  is  now  time  for  Members  of  this  committee  and  all  Members  of  Congress
to lead the way in carrying the torch.

Please  refer  to  the  Bio-S(h)IP  User  Manual  for  a  more  detailed  overview  of  the

key features in the 2005 University of Colorado Solar Decathlon House.

1. Given  your  experience,  what  do  you  think  are  the  main  technical  and
other  barriers  to  greater  use  of  solar  energy?  Do  you  have  any  sugges-
tions  for  what  might  be  done  to  overcome  those  barriers?  How  do  you
see  the  competition  itself  as  helping  to  move  both  solar  and  efficiency
technologies into the mainstream building market?
I believe that there remain technical, educational, institutional and financial bar-

riers to greater market penetration of solar energy.
Technical barriers

There  is  ample  research  yet  to  be  done  to  increase  efficiencies;  reduce  up-front

costs and increase integration.
Educational barriers

Currently  in  the  U.S.,  there  are  only  a  handful  of  universities  that  offer  degree
programs  in  renewable  energy.  I  discovered  the  Building  Systems  Program  at  the
University of Colorado at Boulder through the DOE Solar Decathlon website on the
2002 event.

Institutional barriers

There  exists  an  inherent  and  ever-widening  disconnect  between  the  homes  Solar
Decathletes give form to and the realities of the production home market in the U.S.
I  believe  that  the  competition  falls  short  of  offering  real  solutions  to  how  these
homes can be incorporated into the large subdivisions. We must find ways to facili-
tate  energy  efficient  and  solar  technology  transfer  from  the  Solar  Decathlon  com-
petition  to  the  production  home  market  if  we  aspire  to  appeal  to  the  average  home
buyer.

In  addition,  partnership  with  existing  government  programs  and  national  labora-
tories  is  crucial.  For  example,  none  of  the  2005  Solar  Decathlon  Teams  partnered
with the DOE Building America Program.
Financial barriers

The  CU  Solar  Decathlon  Team’s  budget  in  2005  was  approximately  $500,000.
DOE  funding  to  each  team  will  increase  from  $5,000  in  2005  to  $100,000  in  the
2007  event.  At  a  sponsorship  level  of  $100,000,  the  DOE  is  essentially  requesting
an 80 percent cost share from all of the participating universities. This is a substan-
tial  amount  of  funding  for  undergraduate  and  graduate  engineers  and  architects  to
raise  in  a  12  to  18  month  period.  It  is  certainly  not  enough  time  to  forge  the  type
of partnerships with sponsors that are likely to donate at higher levels.

Increasing  the  funding  level  to  $250,000  per  team  (an  approximate  cost  share  of

50 percent) would have several positive ramifications on the competition.

time to the design and construction phases, rather than fundraising.

• It would increase the quality of each design by allowing teams to devote more
• It  would  ensure  a  more  objective  approach  to  showcasing  only  the  best  tech-
nologies, rather than simply those products that teams are able to secure do-
nations for.
• It would provide a means for accurate accounting of the true retail cost of the
each  home  by  eliminating  the  guess  work  associated  with  product  donation.
2. What sources of information did you draw on to figure out how to build
your  house?  What  problems  arose  in  designing  or  constructing  your
house that surprised you?
The University of Colorado won the Documentation contest in what one judge re-
ferred  to  as  a  ‘‘Tour  de  Force’’  approach.  The  CU  Team’s  principle  resources  were
the professors and faculty advisors from both colleges. Team members developed ex-
pertise  along  the  way  to  perform  necessary  energy  modeling  and  thereby  take  ad-
vantage  of  the  resources  available  on  campus.  A  wealth  of  design  tools  were  used
by the CU Team through the schematic design phase. For example, six separate de-
sign tools were used to model the active and passive solar systems alone in the CU
house.  This  is  a  testament  to  the  need  for  further  integrated  design  tools.  A  trial
and error approach to extensive energy simulation dictated the final design from an
engineering  perspective.  The  CU  Team  submitted  an  exhaustive  Schematic  Energy
Analysis Report early in the design process to organizers at the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory.

Perhaps  the  biggest  surprise  for  me  through  this  entire  process  has  been  how
much  of  the  entire  CU  Team’s  time  was  consumed  by  fundraising.  Unfortunately,
this  time  would  have  been  better  spent  concentrating  on  the  design,  construction
and commissioning phases of the project.
3. Would  your  house  be  commercially  viable?  If  not,  what  changes  would

make it more attractive to the mainstream home buyer?
The CU Team worked with the largest manufactured home builder in the Nation,
Genesis Homes, for the design and construction of the chassis used to transport the
Bio-S(h)IP.  In  addition,  the  CU  Team  worked  with  a  client,  Prospect  New  Town  (a
new-urbanist  development  in  Longmont,  Colorado),  for  the  pre-purchase  of  the
home. Further incorporation of the manufactured home process will inevitably drive
the  retail  construction  cost  of  the  Bio-S(h)IP  down.  In  addition,  all  of  the  products
used in the CU house are commercially available today.

Having one of the longest over-land distances to travel to the competition, CU Bio-
S(h)IP  was  principally  driven  in  design  by  the  need  to  transport  it  thousands  of
miles.  The  average  home  owner  will  never  move  their  home  anywhere,  much  less
thousands  of  miles.  There  is  an  inherent  contradiction  here.  The  mainstream  home
buyer  is  not  interested  in  a  product  that  is  driven  architecturally  by  the  need  for
mobility.  The  Bio-S(h)IP  was  designed  in  cooperation  with  a  specific  client  and  for
the unique purpose of being transported over long distances. For this reason, rather
than  suggest  changes  to  the  Bio-S(h)IP  that  would  render  it  more  attractive  to  the

mainstream  market,  I  offer  suggestions  for  how  to  tailor  future  Solar  Decathlon
competitions  in  a  way  that  will  render  the  finished  products  more  appealing  to  the
average home buyer.

1. Re-examine the merit of an 800 square foot limitation.

There  are  many  applications  for  800  square  foot  solar-powered  buildings;
low-income housing, developing world and war-torn area aid relief, and Na-
tive  American  reservations.  These  are  not  mainstream  home  buyer  applica-
tions, however. According to the National Association of Home Builders, the
average size of a homes purchased in the U.S. is now 2,200 square feet.

2. Consider a grid-tied application including net-metering.

Establishing a mini grid for the Solar Village our enabling each team to tie
into the local electrical grid would accommodate smaller PV arrays and bat-
tery bank sizes and would also give the general public a truer sense of what
living with solar would be like for them.

3. Exchange the Energy Balance contest for a Life-Cycle Cost contest.

The cost of construction and operation is of far greater interest to the aver-
age home buyer than is the concept of energy balance. With a more diligent
accounting  of  the  cost  of  construction  and  a  net-metering  scenario,  teams
could conceivably compete for the lowest life-cycle cost.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you very much.
Mr. Knowles, you are recognized for five minutes.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  JONATHAN  R.  KNOWLES,  PROFESSOR
AND TEAM FACULTY ADVISOR, DEPARTMENT OF ARCHITEC-
TURE, RHODE ISLAND SCHOOL OF DESIGN
Mr.  KNOWLES.  Thank  you,  Madame  Chairwoman  and  Members

of the Subcommittee. I am very pleased to be here today.

I am joined with my testimony with Christina Zanconnie, who is
a  Bachelor  of  Architect  candidate  for  2006  and  William  Thomas  of
Arden  Engineering,  who  was  our  mechanical  consultant  and  con-
tractor for the project.

I am just going to briefly go over some of the strategies we used
in  designing  the  project,  basically  about  our  planning,  our  town-
house concept, and some of the technical innovations that we devel-
oped.

First is a design overview. The house was designed in, basically,
two  sections  in  that  the  students  were  interested  in  interweaving
passive  and  solar  strategies,  some  untried,  some  new.  The  south
end  was  the  candidate  for  the  passive  strategies,  and  it  included
a green roof for insulation and water management, and then deep-
set  windows  to  allow  the—to  block  the  hot  summer  sun  and  let  in
the  deep  winter  sun.  The  north  half  of  the  house  was  our  photo-
voltaic half that included the solar panels and then the technical—
the components in what we called the ‘‘appliance garage.’’

By having the house broken into two halves, we allowed the cir-
culation  to  sort  of  weave  its  way  between  parts  of  the  house  in
order  to  manage  the  100,000  people  that  came  marching  through
to  sort  of  demand  to  know  what  we  were  doing,  which  worked  out
very  well.  It  was  a  very  efficient  plan,  and  enabled  no  bottlenecks
for all of the visitors to move through the house.

[Slide.]
What  you  might  have  noticed  in  the  last  slide,  and  I  will  turn
it back, is that the orientation of our house differed from all others
in that it was oriented north-south on the Mall. And this was a dis-
covery by the students that the house could have a townhouse type
orientation  in  that  the  students  were  interested  in  a  slim,  urban
lot  to  sort  of  promote  ideas  of  density,  conservation,  land  manage-
ment,  et  cetera.  So  the  idea  of  the  house,  although  we  could  only
build  one,  was  to  actually  aggregate  in  series  in—on  a  street,  in  a
dense, urban situation.

And  that  led  to  where  the  front  lawn  of  your  townhouse  is  on
your  roof.  The  landscape  architecture  students  in  our  school  de-
signed  quite  a  lovely  roof  garden.  Again,  that  provided  insulation,
a  fourth  room  of  the  house,  and  helped  control  the  rainwater  that
was  so  abundant  during  the  week  of  the  competition.  We  did  have
the  opportunity  to  have  two  lovely  dinners  on  the  roof.  We  hoped
to score points with the jury for that, but that didn’t work, but we
got the dinners nonetheless.

I  am  describing  all  of  these  ideas,  because  they  intertwine.  To
buy  the  real  estate  for  the  roof  garden,  we  had  to  make  a  much
smaller  system  than  we  had  originally  anticipated,  so  we  essen-
tially have—or had 24 Sanyo 190-watt panels for a total of 4.6 kilo-
watts of energy. And we designed the system with 16 batteries for
four days of storage. This idea was explored, or for the economy of
the  panels,  24  panels  are  a  lot  less  expensive  than  many  more,
which  made  great  sound  strategy  and  providence  but  was  horrible
here  in  Washington  during  the  deluge.  So  our  project  conked  out
promptly on Wednesday night, the four days that we had the stor-
age.

Another  way  to  buy  the  real  estate  of  a  smaller  solar  system,  to
keep  the  cost  down,  is  we  developed  a  louver  system,  we  called  it
the  heliotropic  louvers,  that  essentially  shed  this  hot  sun  off  the
house.  And  that  effectively  lowered  our  air-conditioning  costs,  or
load,  by  40  percent.  It  also  created  a  dramatic  chameleon-like  as-
pect  of  the  house  in  that  the  skin  of  the  house  moved  during  the
day,  changing  its  character  and  color.  It  also  had  another  benefit
of  setting  up  a  thermal  draft.  One  side  of  the  louver  got  hot,  the
other cool, so it set up a micro-convection against the house, again
shedding the hot heat of the house away.

And  finally,  with  all  of  these  benefits  of  being  small,  efficient,
and  cost-effective  is  designing  a  very  efficient  air-conditioning  and
heating  system.  And  we  used  phase  change  materials  that  were
suggested and developed with Arden Engineering and Bill Thomas
behind  me,  and  essentially  it  was  two  containers,  one  for  the  hot
side,  one  for  the  cool  side,  sounds  like  that  old  McDonald’s  sand-
wich,  that  were  able  to  store  our  energy  for  future  use.  The  cool
side phase change materials are charged by the cool night air. The
box is opened up, the air is drawn across the phase change bricks,

the box is closed, and then we run water through the box and into
radiant ceiling panels, so it is, in essence, a radiant cooling system.
In  the  winter,  we  use  the  hot  water  panels  on  the  roof  to  provide
us  with  hot  water.  That  again  charges  the  hot  box,  shown  on  your
right,  and  again,  water  is  run  to  the  hot  box,  through  the  radiant
ceiling panels, same tubes to create radiant heating.

With  this  system,  we  allowed—we  again  reduced  our  cost,  and
essentially the only thing that is moving that water is small pumps
that  take  very  little  energy.  So  we  essentially  have  no  chiller.  So
all  of  these  ideas  were  interwoven  for  efficiency  and  cost  and  for
the size of the house.

And  I  just  want  to  show  briefly  some  of  the  best  photographs  of
the  construction  of  the  project  and,  in  conclusion,  thank  the  many
students  who  devoted  two  years  of  their  lives  working  and  con-
structing this house on the Mall.

Thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JONATHAN R. KNOWLES

Two Ways: Interweaving Passive and Active/Efficiency and Excess

Solar  houses  are  often  characterized  by  the  ‘‘either/or’’  of  passive  or  active  tech-
niques. ‘‘Passive’’ systems strategically use walls, window placement and overhangs
to control solar gain, where ‘‘active’’ systems deploy pumps, piping and mechanisms
to  collect,  store  and  redistribute  the  sun’s  energy.  The  RISD  Solar  team’s  approach
interweaves these two strategies by creating a symbiosis between the building enve-
lope  and  the  heating  and  cooling  system  each  working  in  both  ways.  With  RISD
Solar,  building  components  that  are  traditionally  static,  move  (through  computer-
ized  servos  and  biological  means),  while  elements  that  are  normally  part  of  a
mechanized system are visually inert (they move at the chemical and atomic level).
The  coordination  of  these  two  strategies  allows  the  occupant  to  engage  the  varia-
bility of the surrounding natural environment in unique ways.

RISD’s  800  square  foot  exhibition  house  is  formed  by  the  intersection  of  two  vol-
umes, one, which incorporates ‘‘passive’’ techniques and the other, which houses the
‘‘active’’  components.  The  north-south  orientation  rewrites  previous  rules  governing
the layout of a solar house, which generally would stretch a building along an east-
west axis. With the north-south axis, light changes throughout the day. The house,
divided  into  four  discrete  domestic  spaces:  living/kitchen,  bathroom/laundry,  bed-
room/office  and  garden/prospect,  has  a  main  circulation  path  which  is  designed  to
lead  a  large  number  of  visitors  parallel  to  this  east-west  movement.  A  shorter  pri-
vate  circuit  within  the  house  ends  at  a  secluded  roof  garden  with  an  extraordinary
vista  (the  U.S.  Capital  and  the  Mall).  Enclosing  these  spaces  are  multi-functioning
double skin walls, roof and floors.
Windows and Daylight

Traditional  solar  homes  use  an  excess  of  southern  glazing  in  combination  with
thermal  mass  to  obtain  passive  heating.  In  the  RISD  house,  windows  are  carefully
sized  and  arranged  to  provide  a  balance  between  the  correct  amount  of  light  and
well-insulated  walls.  To  arrive  at  a  the  lighting  strategy,  appropriate  light  levels
were  determined  based  on  the  functions  of  the  various  spaces,  then  measurements
were  calculated  and  daylighting  models  were  tested.  The  result  is  three  interior
spaces  with  distinct  light  effects.  The  south  end  opens  to  the  changing  light  of  the
day with a relatively large southern glass wall. Overhangs, louvers and curtains fur-
ther  control  the  sun’s  rays  and  allow  warm  light  to  enter  during  the  winter  and
keep  out  harsh  overheated  sun  in  the  summer.  The  hall,  which  is  intentionally  the
darkest  area,  brings  a  spot  of  natural  light  through  a  roof  hatch  that  doubles  as
a skylight. In the bedroom/workspace, high transom windows bounce eastern morn-
ing and diffused northern light around the space while smaller windows provide iso-
lated  views.  The  placement  of  the  windows  is  designed  to  avoid  glare  on  computer
and TV monitors and create a gentle glow.
Well-Insulated Surfaces

One of the primary sustainable systems used in this house is straightforward, af-
fordable and invisible to the eye. The exterior walls, floors and roof of the structure,

36

designed  as  lightweight  and  material  efficient  stressed  skin  panels,  are  filled  with
one of today’s best performing building insulation. Between the insulation, cladding,
and airspace, these walls attain an R-value (resistance to thermal transference) that
is  a  third  more  than  recommended  by  Federal  Energy  Code.  Isonyne  insulation  is
blown in and thereby installed to make the building ‘‘tight.’’ This means air cannot
move  through  unplanned  openings  in  the  floor  and  walls.  Windows  and  doors  also
perform  better  than  standard  houses  as  the  windows  are  coated  with  tin  oxide  to
reflect infrared heat, double-glazed and fully gasketed. Attention to a well-insulated
envelope allowed our engineers to reduce the size of their heating and cooling equip-
ment.
Heliotropic Louvers

On  the  exterior  walls  of  the  house,  a  set  of  louvers  literally  moves  with  the  sun.
These vertical fins, offset from the main structure, are used to regulate the amount
of  sun  hitting  the  house  and  to  create  a  chimney  effect  of  the  cool  air  drawn  up
from  the  ground.  In  the  summer,  the  louvers  track  the  sun  with  their  broad  edge,
reflecting its rays away from the building and keeping the house cool. In the winter,
the  louvers  track  the  sun  with  their  thin  edge,  maximizing  the  amount  of  sun  hit-
ting  the  house.  A  mapping  of  the  solar  light  angles  throughout  the  year  was  used
to determine the movement of the louvers. The result is a house in motion, changing
its character as the Earth spins.
Roof Garden

The  roof  garden,  which  is  made  up  of  a  series  of  shallow  portable  planters,  pro-
vides  many  advantages.  It  plays  an  aesthetic  role  by  extending  the  form  of  the
house and creating a place of refuge. In addition, the variegated grasses and sedum,
chosen because they require minimal water and maintenance, shade the house when
full  grown  in  the  summer  while  the  herbs  can  be  used  in  the  kitchen.  The  light-
weight soil provides extra insulation, and absorbs water runoff. A water trough col-
lects  rainwater  for  irrigating  the  garden  and  use  in  a  grey  water  system.  The  gar-
den thus extends the usable living space of the house in area and in spirit.
Solar Surfaces

Like  the  louvers  and  garden,  the  roof  of  the  north  end  is  covered  with  a  second
skin.  The  solar  collecting  panels  shade  the  light  colored  roofing  membrane,  thereby
helping  to  cool  the  house  while  also  generating  energy.  These  panels  provide  both
the heat and electrical energy for the house and are the first component of the me-
chanical  systems.  The  RISD  solar  team’s  decision  was  to  use  as  few  solar  panels
as  possible  in  order  to  make  room  for  the  roof  garden  and  reduce  the  cost  of  con-
struction. Therefore, they used the most efficient mono-crystalline photovoltaic pan-
els  available  and  energy  efficient  appliances  to  reduce  the  total  surface  area  of  the
array.  The  photovoltaic  panels  each  produce  190-Watts  to  form  a  4.6  Kilowatt  sys-
tem for the house. The solar hot water collectors are of the evacuated tube cylinder
type,  which  are  more  efficient  than  flat  plate  collectors  and  allow  solar  heat  collec-
tion in colder climates and cloudy days.
Appliance Garage and Energy Star Appliances and Fixtures

The  Appliance  Garage,  situated  at  the  north  end  of  the  house,  is  a  large  storage
space  divided  into  easily  accessible  cabinets.  This  cabinet  is  made  of  thin  walls  to
conserve  space  and  uses  nanotechnology  (nanopaint)  to  withstand  the  coldest  side
of  the  house.  On  the  exterior,  the  Garage  contains  storage  space  and  the  electric
equipment  that  converts  and  stores  the  electricity  produced  from  the  photovoltaic
panels  (through  inverters  and  batteries).  The  interior  opens  up  into  a  home  office
with filing cabinets, and also includes attic storage and a wardrobe. The flat screen
monitor,  lights  and  appliances  are  all  energy  efficient  and  energy  star  rated.  The
use  of  these  fixtures  reduces  the  load  and  the  size  of  the  photovoltaic  system  with-
out compromising functionality.
Building Systems: Heating, Cooling and Ventilation

The  core  is  the  most  compact  component  of  the  house  thereby  freeing  space  for
the  living  areas.  Acting  as  the  heart,  it  contains  the  hot  water  heating  tank,  the
bathroom,  the  kitchen,  the  washer/dryer  and  access  to  the  roof  garden.  Above  the
bathroom  is  our  Sistine  ceiling—a  carefully  designed  and  built  mechanical  space
where  the  pumps,  manifolds  and  ventilation  equipment  are  housed.  The  central  lo-
cation of this high performance equipment minimizes duct and pipe runs, which in-
creases  efficiency.  Three  systems  are  used  to  maintain  thermal  comfort:  a  solar
heating  loop  that  heats  both  domestic  hot  water  and  the  space,  a  cooling  loop  that
is charged by cool night air, and an Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV) that controls
the building’s supply and exhaust ventilation.

37

The  heating  and  cooling  systems  use  the  principle  of  Thermal  Energy  Storage
(TES).  The  storage  is  through  Phase  Change  Materials  (PCMs).  The  ability  of  the
Phase  Change  Materials  to  store  and  release  latent  heat  allows  this  material  to
store thermal energy in a smaller area, roughly 1/10 the area of water storage. For
heating,  we  store  solar  thermal  energy  from  the  solar  collectors  during  the  day  for
usage  during  the  night  or  days  of  no  sun.  For  cooling,  we  use  Phase  Change  Mate-
rials to store nighttime ambient air temperatures 60°F or below for daytime cooling.
Heating  and  cooling  are  stored  in  two  separate  PCM  containers,  which  use  heat
exchangers to transfer the stored heating or cooling thermal energies to radiant ceil-
ing  panels.  The  radiant  panels  are  combination  panels  used  for  both  heating  and
cooling.  This  is  achieved  through  a  variable  speed  primary/secondary  pumping  sys-
tem located in the mechanical space. Using a hydronic variable speed pumping sys-
tem  allows  us  to  use  only  the  energy  needed  to  heat  and  cool  at  a  given  time  and
requirement,  at  very  low  energy  consumption.  For  comparison,  a  heat  pump  sized
for the same heating and cooling loads would require 2,250 Watts of power at max-
imum  design  conditions.  If  that  heat  pump  were  of  the  newer  variable  speed  type,
the wattage range would be between 550–2250 Watts based on load conditions. Once
our system is ‘‘charged’’ (i.e., has heating and cooling stored in the PCMs), our max-
imum  wattage  needed  to  heat  and  cool  our  building  (because  all  we  are  using  is
pumps) is 167 Watts. If we were to include the energy used by the Energy Recovery
Ventilator  when,  or  if,  needed  to  control  possible  condensation,  we  would  be  at  a
total of 489 Watts. As we are using variable speed pumping and have variable speed
control  on  our  ERV,  our  maximum  wattage  usage  is  from  489  Watts  down  to  135
Watts based on load conditions.

Hydronic radiant cooling and heating systems can remove or add a given amount
of  thermal  energy  using  less  than  five  percent  of  the  fan  energy  that  would  other-
wise  be  necessary  if  using  an  all  air  heating  and  cooling  system.  The  advantages
to our system over conventional heating and cooling technologies are:

for the building.

• We  are  using  natural  ambient  conditions  to  provide  the  heating  and  cooling
• Through the Phase Change Material Storage, we presently have the capacity
to store days worth of heating and cooling strictly from environmental sources
at design degree days.
• Through  the  use  of  radiant  heating  and  radiant  cooling,  we  are  able  to  pro-
vide  the  same  heating  and  cooling  capacity  as  a  ‘‘conventional’’  system  using
much less energy, and at a higher comfort level to the occupants. Another ad-
vantage to this system is the effect it has on the thermal envelope heat trans-
fer  of  the  building.  Because  the  heating  temperature  of  the  water  is  lower,
the  temperature  difference  across  the  thermal  envelope  (walls,  roof,  etc.)  is
also  lower.  This  translates  into  less  heat  loss  out  of  the  building.  The  same
works  for  the  radiant  cooling  which  operates  at  a  higher  cooling  water  tem-
perature  than  a  conventional  system.  The  less  temperature  difference  across
a surface, the lower the heat transfer across that surface.

• Our system was designed to be simple, both in operation and installation.

The intent of this system is to show the potential for a building to have long-term
energy storage and the use of natural heating and cooling through the use of Phase
Change Materials.
Assembly ∂ Structure

Because  the  competition  required  that  the  house  be  moved  from  Providence,  RI
to Washington, DC and back, the house is designed as a modular home that is dis-
assembled  into  nine  individual  modules.  The  RISD  team  divided  their  house  into
many  modules  so  that  the  internal  spaces  could  be  more  generous  while  still  con-
forming  to  highway  restrictions.  The  modules  are  bolted  together  at  seams,  leaving
most of the interior and exterior finishes intact. The exposed ‘‘expansion’’ joints and
the strength of the plywood finishes allow the house to be moved without cracking.
The entire structure was built with off-the-shelf, low-tech products enabling it to be
built  on  site  with  minimal  shop  outsourcing  and  thus  controlling  costs.  The  team
was  careful  to  choose  materials  that  met  strict  requirements.  The  materials  have
low embodied energy (i.e., local and recycled), do not aversely effect indoor air qual-
ity  (low  volatile  organic  compounds  and  nontoxic  glues),  do  not  harm  the  environ-
ment (no CFCs) and are renewable (plywood farmed with sustainable practices, and
the use of fast growing cork).
Planning

While  RISD  built  only  one  house  for  the  Solar  Decathlon,  the  building  layout  af-
fords  site  adaptability.  It  can  be  used  as  a  freestanding  house  or  an  urban  town-

house.  The  orientation  of  the  building  favors  the  north/south  axis  while  an  offset
of the parts allows for adequate light throughout even if the units are clustered to-
gether  or  repeated.  As  a  ‘‘townhouse,’’  the  project  responds  in  a  unique  way  to  the
questions  posed  by  the  organizers  of  the  Solar  Decathlon.  When  the  units  come  to-
gether, their displacement in section and in plan creates interstitial spaces that can
become  oases  within  the  urban  context.  The  idea  of  the  solar  village,  while  not  a
novel  concept,  becomes  more  energy  efficient  with  the  aggregation  of  more  units.
Uniting design with urban values, our solution addresses the issues of sustainability
not only within the individual house, but also on a community scale.
Less and More

Through  interweaving  strategies  of  passive  and  active  solar  techniques,  we  have
worked to achieve both efficiency and richness. While our wall and mechanical sys-
tems work intelligently together to create substantial efficiencies, they also allow for
delightful  excesses.  With  zero  emissions,  the  house  generates  surplus  energy.  Each
one  of  our  techniques  is  integrated  to  create  a  singular  design.  Paramount  to  the
project  has  been  balancing  the  need  for  energy  efficiency  and  production  with  the
principles of thoughtful architectural design.
Questions and Answers
(1) Given  your  experience,  what  do  you  think  are  the  main  technical  and  other  bar-
riers to greater use of solar energy? Do you have any suggestions for what might
be done to overcome those barriers? How do you see the competition itself as help-
ing  to  move  both  solar  and  efficiency  technologies  into  the  mainstream  building
market?

No  barriers  currently  exist  except  public  accessibility.  RISD  Solar  uses  16  deep-
cell batteries, two charge controllers and two invertors to convert and store the sun’s
energy from 24 190-Watt Photovoltaic Panels. The system is small, robust and most
importantly,  off  the  shelf.  The  PV  panels  generate  4,560  Watts  of  energy  and  are
affordable  at  a  cost  of  approximately  $41,000.  This  is  $9.00  per  watt,  which  is  on
the  lower  cost  side  of  a  battery  backup  system.  If  we  assume  a  20-year  life,  with
minor  maintenance  costs,  the  system  generates  energy  at  $.29/kWh.  Since  our  de-
sign  was  intended  for  an  urban  environment,  battery  back-up  could  be  greatly  re-
duced  or  eliminated,  reducing  the  cost,  and  reducing  electricity  costs  to  $.22/kWh.
By comparison, our electric bills in Rhode Island are $.14/kWh or roughly half. Over
20  years,  however,  the  cost  of  electricity  will  surpass  solar  electric.  If  solar  tech-
nologies  were  subsidized  to  the  extent  that  the  oil  industry  (with  the  associated
transportation  industries)  are  currently  subsidized,  there  would  be  a  boom  in  the
market that would reduce these costs and begin to move the Nation towards energy
independence.

Another  path  to  the  same  goal  would  be  to  offer  National  incentives  coordinated
through  pre-existing  State  programs.  Many  States  offer  grants  combined  with  tax
breaks to promote alternative energy, but all State programs are not the same. The
cost  is  usually  supported  by  a  small  surcharge  on  the  public’s  energy  bill.  An  in-
crease in demand, especially supported and advertised at the federal level will bring
the  market  to  bear,  and  with  it  the  research  funds  to  make  the  technology  more
affordable.  Also,  the  Federal  Government  should  continue  to  support  University
driven  research  and  competitions  such  as  the  Solar  Decathlon.  Differing  from  con-
ventions and trade shows, the Solar Decathlon is a public demonstration; the houses
work and prove that the technology is here now. Nothing presented at the Solar De-
cathlon  is  out  of  the  public’s  reach.  Perhaps  the  competition  itself  should  expand
across the country and become regional, attracting solutions specific to the climates
in  the  East,  Midwest  and  West.  Finally,  a  critical  part  of  our  design  was  the  effi-
ciency of our heating and cooling system. This system would require more research
and development for it to enter the market as an available product.
(2) What  sources  of  information  did  you  draw  on  to  figure  out  how  to  build  your
house?  What  problems  arose  in  designing  or  constructing  your  house  that  sur-
prised you?

At RISD we had the opportunity to spend time on critical research about environ-
mental  technologies,  which  is  not  commonly  possible  in  practice.  We  used  book
sources, trade shows, consumer guides and direct evaluation of products. The RISD
Solar  student  team  researched  and  designed  every  aspect  of  the  house  but  it  was
not  until  we  engaged  the  local  building  industry  did  the  choices  and  opportunities
become much more clear. For instance, we would have preferred to use factory built
SIPs  (structurally  insulated  panels)  for  the  roof,  walls  and  floors  but  we  decided  to
use  a  stressed  skin  panel  system  instead  so  these  components  could  be  constructed
on  site  and  by  our  own  forces.  Stress  skin  panels  are  very  similar  to  wood  frame

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 07:52 Mar 23, 2006 Jkt 024150 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\ENER05\110205\24150 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

39

(or  light  frame)  construction  except  each  panel  relies  on  the  interior  and  exterior
sheathing (plywood or oriented strand board) for structural stability. We eventually
found a local company that prefabricated the majority of our stress skin panels but
we insulated and sheathed the interior surfaces ourselves.

Problems to work out next time include construction tolerances, weight and trans-
port.  The  RISD  Solar  house  was  designed  to  come  apart  in  too  many  pieces  that
were difficult to fit back together. The more pieces, the greater the construction tol-
erance  required,  which  demands  a  sophisticated  solution  to  integrate  module  joints
within the design. Also, each stressed skin floor, wall or roof panel weighs approxi-
mately  1,000  pounds,  which  cannot  be  easily  maneuvered  by  an  untrained  work-
force.  When  1,000-pound  panels  are  brought  together  to  form  a  module,  weight  be-
comes  a  serious  issue  and  cranes  or  lifts  are  required  to  move  pieces  of  the  house
into  place.  To  move  a  house,  it  must  be  lightweight  and  easy  to  assemble  and  dis-
assemble. The Solar Decathlon competition strongly favors modular homes that can
be  moved  down  the  highway,  set  up  quickly  and  taken  down  as  quickly.  We  were
pleased  that  our  room  proportions  were  generous,  but  more  research  is  required  to
move a house that does not have the characteristics of a mobile home.
(3) Would  your  house  be  commercially  viable?  If  not,  what  changes  would  make  it

more attractive to the mainstream home buyer?

The  size  of  the  RISD  Solar  house  could  be  commercially  viable  for  a  very  limited
market—young  professionals  or  empty  nesters.  The  total  RISD  Solar  budget  was
$400,000.00,  which  is  expensive  for  800  square  feet  and  translates  to  $500/square
foot or the cost of a high-end Manhattan apartment renovation. If transport, travel,
lodging,  etc.,  is  removed  from  the  budget,  the  cost  is  closer  to  $200/square  foot,
which  is  not  unreasonable  for  a  new  house.  That  is  why  the  RISD  Solar  team
planned  an  urban  dwelling—the  aggregation  of  units  would  lower  the  cost.  Effi-
ciency  is  an  important  element  of  our  townhouse  proposal:  mechanical  systems  are
centralized leaving more room for the flexible use of living space; plumbing and air
duct runs are minimized lowering the cost of these expensive components; the bath-
room space itself is the shower enclosure; and a Murphy (fold away) bed transforms
the  bedroom  into  the  home  office.  While  all  of  these  space-saving  strategies  save
money  and  are  applicable  to  today’s  market,  our  house  would  require  the  addition
of more area to be marketable as a house to be sold in the U.S.

For  the  past  two  years,  we  have  been  working  on  an  extraor-
dinary project, an advanced solar hydrogen home. Our progress has
been  realized  through  extensive  interdisciplinary  efforts  of  stu-
dents,  faculty,  and  staff.  We  strongly  believe  that  solar  energy,  re-
newable hydrogen, and sustainable design offer a future of true en-
ergy  independence,  a  clean  environment,  and  a  greatly  enhanced
civilization.

of  energy  by  converting  sunlight  into  electricity  and  sending  it  to

tricity to power the house.

benefits of solar energy and the true costs of the current fossil fuel-
based  system  to  the  environment  and  national  security;  the  high
cost of—and short supply of solar panels and raw materials; the in-
consistency  and  uncertainty  of  government  incentives  for  home-
owners  and  developers;  lack  of  training  for  engineers,  construction
workers, architects, and business people.

The mounting energy crisis and technologic advances have indus-
try,  academia,  and  the  government  looking  to  develop  hydrogen
fuel  cells  as  a  viable  alternative  to  fossil  fuels.  Current  barriers  to
the greater use of hydrogen include: lack of public awareness about
the  capabilities,  safety,  and  benefits  of  hydrogen;  the  need  to  im-
prove fuel cell, electrolyzer, and energy storage technologies by de-
creasing  costs  and  improving  efficiency,  integration,  and  life  span
of the equipment.

The  government  is  supporting  the  development  of  solar  and  hy-
drogen  technologies.  We  would  advise  increasing  this  investment
and setting out a clear vision, a bold national strategy with specific
milestones  that  lead  towards  a  clean  and  renewable  energy  econ-
omy.

The  Solar  Decathlon  had  a  deeply  positive  impact  on  helping  to
move  solar  and  efficiency  technologies  into  the  mainstream  build-
ing market. At our school, it inspired over 100 students and faculty
from the architecture, engineering, interior design, and communica-
tions departments to work together. The knowledge and experience
gained  from  this  project  will  carry  with  us,  as  we  become  the  next
generation of leaders in our respective fields.

Through  fundraising  and  PR  efforts,  our  ideas  were  shared  with
many  leading  figures  in  the  building  and  energy  fields.  While  on
the  National  Mall  during  the  event,  the  flow  of  people  and  the  in-
terest  they  had  in  solar  and  efficiency  technologies  was  breath-
taking. Everyone wanted solar today.

I  can  see  that  my  time  is  almost  up  here.  I  just  wanted  to  men-
tion  that—to  address  this  question  of  what  major  challenges  we
had  and  problems  that  came  about.  I  would  certainly  agree  that
fundraising  and  learning—figuring  out  how  we  were  going  to  pay
for  everything  was  a  major  issue  for  us,  and  I  think  likewise  with
the  other  teams.  And  so  we  also  noticed  that  there  was  sort  of  a
lack  of  money  available  for  systems  integration  research.  So  it  is,
you know—there is money available for specific lines, but to put it
all  together  and  make  it  work  as  a  package  is  something  that  we
are really looking to further.

So  with  that,  I  would  like  to  thank  you  very  much  for  the—for
pursuing  this  important  discussion,  this  important  dialogue,  and
we look forward to moving these issues forward.

Thank you.

I. INTRODUCTION

We  thank  Chairman  Biggert  and  distinguished  Members  of  the  Energy  Sub-
committee  for  allowing  us  to  submit  this  testimony.  It  is  a  great  honor  to  present
the New York Institute of Technology’s (NYIT) and the U.S. Merchant Marine Acad-

The  authors  of  this  document  are  David  Schieren,  the  Energy  Team  Leader  from
NYIT,  Heather  Korb,  Lead  Architect  from  NYIT  and  Greg  Sachs,  Lead  Engineer
from the USMMA.

For the past two years we have been working on an extraordinary project—an ad-
vanced Solar Hydrogen home that we believe demonstrates the promise of a secure
energy future. We strongly believe in the promise of solar energy, renewable hydro-
gen  and  sustainable  design.  With  these  tools  and  resources,  supported  by  substan-
tial research and development, we see a future of true energy independence, a clean
environment, and a greatly enhanced civilization.

Our  progress  has  been  realized  through  extensive  interdisciplinary  team  efforts
of the full NYIT community—the architecture, engineering, interior design, commu-
nications  and  culinary  departments,  the  administration,  staff  and  countless  sup-
porters—and  our  USMMA  partners.  Key  students,  faculty,  and  staff  worked  tire-
lessly, often without remuneration, to pursue this vision of a better world.
II. PROJECT OVERVIEW
1. Philosophy

First  a  vision,  a  philosophy  of  sustainability,  then  a  design  competition,  and  the

project blossomed.

NYIT’s  Solar  Home  is  called  Green  Machine/Blue  Space  (Rendering).  Green  Ma-
chine,  the  life  support  of  the  house  and  Blue  Space,  the  solar-collecting  dwelling
place,  are  two  parts  working  together  as  one  self-sustaining  unit.  Green  Machine/
Blue  Space  separates  the  mechanics  of  life  from  leisure  space  to  create  a  home
which can exist anywhere in the world.
2. Designs

i. Green Machine: a Global Design Strategy

• GM is a modified shipping container that houses the mechanics of life includ-
ing  a  kitchen,  a  bathroom,  roof  garden  for  food  production,  solar  water  heat-
ing, and hydrogen production and storage.

• Containers  are  found  in  surplus  worldwide.  We  consider  them  a  pre-made

space—structurally sound and easily transported by rail, air and sea.

• When  modified  for  climate  conditioning  and  equipped  with  a  self  sustaining,
non-polluting  energy  storage  system  and  all  the  necessities  of  living  com-
fortably the GM supports life.

ii. Blue Space: a Local Design Strategy

• Blue Space is a dwelling place that is designed to be site-specific.
• The  construction,  design  and  materials  emphasize  sustainability  and  mini-
mize  the  energy  loads  through  interior  design,  passive  solar  strategies  and
natural ventilation.

• The  Blue  Space’s  size,  construction  and  architecture  can  change  according  to

the climate and culture of the site.

• Furniture  pieces  in  the  living  space  are  designed  as  micro-environments  to

help minimize the use of mechanical heating and cooling, and lighting.

iii. Interior Design

The  interior  space  of  the  home  is  unique  and  in  harmony  with  the  architecture

of the home as well as the local environment.

• Furniture  pieces  in  the  living  space  are  designed  as  micro-environments  to

help minimize the use of mechanical heating and cooling, and lighting.

• Furniture will be multi-functional suggesting an economy of materials for fu-

ture homes.

• Materials used will be sustainable and support the energy strategy.

The  goal  of  our  project  is  to  exhibit  self-sufficiency,  energy  independence  and  life
in  a  clean  environment  where  we  eliminate  pollution  and  destruction.  We  design
with  nature  as  a  model—we  produce,  use,  recycle  and  begin  again—a  regenerative
cycle  of  life.  Our  decision  to  use  a  Hydrogen-based  energy  storage  system  stemmed
from this philosophy.

• Solar panels are the primary source of energy and convert sunlight into elec-

tricity and send it to the house loads.

• Surplus  solar  energy  is  sent  to  an  electrolyzer  that  produces  hydrogen  gas

from water.

• When  there  is  no  sunlight,  the  fuel  cell  converts  the  hydrogen  gas  back  into

electricity to power the house.

• This is a quiet and clean process: The fuel-cell byproducts are water and heat,

and the water is used again and converted back into hydrogen.

• This  was  version  1  of  what  we  think  can  become  a  very  robust  home  energy

• This is a vital demonstration project: Applying these technologies will help de-

system.

termine how to improve it.

ii. Operational Overview

As discussed, this is a solar powered home that uses hydrogen gas as the primary

energy storage medium as opposed to a battery based system.

To understand the basic operation of the ‘‘Solar-Hydrogen’’ home, it is constructive
to first consider the operation of a typical battery installation. When there is excess
PV  produced  electricity  (when  energy  supplied  by  the  PV  array  is  greater  than  en-
ergy  demanded  by  the  house)  unused  energy  is  stored  in  chemical  bonds  formed
within  a  battery’s  electrolyte.  That  energy  is  stored  until  demand  is  greater  than
supply (when the sun is hidden or after turning on a lot of loads in the house), and
the battery discharges.

In a Solar-Hydrogen home, when energy supply is greater than demand, the sur-
plus  energy  is  consumed  by  the  hydrogen  generator  to  produce  hydrogen  gas.  This
gas therefore represents stored energy that is stored in a series of low pressure hy-
drogen  tanks.  Subsequently,  when  demand  is  greater  than  supply,  this  gaseous  en-
ergy is consumed by the fuel-cell to produce electricity.

iii. Radiant Hot Water

The  hot  water  system  uses  thirty  ‘‘evacuated  tubes’’  for  hot  water  production.
Evacuated  tubes  are  devices  which  collect  solar-radiation  from  the  sun  and  convert
it  directly  into  thermal  heat-energy.  This  heat-energy  then  directly  raises  the  tem-
perature  of  a  liquid  which  flows  along  the  end  of  these  tubes.  This  liquid  then  cir-
culates  in  a  continuous  loop  between  the  evacuated  tubes  and  the  hot  water  tank.
The  hot-water  tank  thereby  gets  warmer  and  warmer  as  heat  is  transferred  from
the evacuated tubes into the drinking water inside the tank.
4. Benefits

• We believe that hydrogen can replace fossil fuels and end dependency on for-

eign nations for this critical economic input.

• As  this  project  demonstrates,  it  can  be  generated  from  a  locally  produced

power that is clean and renewable.

• Hydrogen  gas  is  superior  to  and  more  versatile  than  other  energy  storage

technologies, such as batteries.

Æ It is versatile:

• Can be used for house electricity, to heat or cook with.
• Once stored, it does not discharge. Batteries discharge.
• It can also be used to quick-fill cars, compared to battery electric cars

that take time to charge.

• It is a clean fuel, there are no negative environmental consequences.

Batteries are toxic and must be carefully handled.

• A  renewable  hydrogen  energy  system  offers  the  promise  of  true  energy  inde-

pendence and a clean environment.

• This  is  the  model  of  a  new  energy  paradigm,  a  distributed  generation  energy
system—superior  to  the  vulnerable  and  cumbersome  centralized  system  of
today.

III. QUESTION RESPONSES
Given your experience, what do you think are the main technical and other
barriers to greater use of solar energy?

In general, the solar energy equipment and infrastructure available today is high
quality,  contributing  to  a  boom  in  photovoltaic  installations.  As  demonstrated  with
the  Solar  Decathlon  entries  and  many  homes  across  the  country,  solar  power  does
an  excellent  job  of  powering  a  home.  However,  to  take  solar  to  the  next  level  (cur-
rently  well  under  one  percent  of  U.S.  installed  generation  capacity)  there  are  bar-
riers to overcome, including:

• Lack of public awareness about the benefits of solar energy and the true costs
of the current fossil fuel based system to the environment and national secu-
rity.

• The high cost and short supply of solar panels and raw materials.
• The  inconsistency  and  uncertainty  of  government  incentives  for  homeowners.
• Lack of training for engineers, construction workers, architects, and business

• Efficiency of the panels must be improved.
• Lack of incentives for new property developers to incorporate into structures.
How  can  they  recoup  their  costs?  Does  a  home  with  solar  power  sell  for  a
higher price? What tools are there to evaluate this?

• Lack  of  Utility  company  support,  through  public  or  private  initiatives,  to

build out solar.

What are the main technical and other barriers to greater use of hydrogen?
Hydrogen fuel cell technology has been around for some time, but only recently—
because  of  the  mounting  energy  crises  and  technological  advances  have  industry,
academia  and  government  began  to  research  hydrogen  fuel  cells  as  a  viable  alter-
native to fossil fuels. This is a long, but worthwhile journey. Current barriers to the
greater use of hydrogen include:

• Lack of public awareness about the capabilities, safety and benefits of hydro-

people.

gen.

• The need to improve fuel cell, electrolyzer and energy storage technologies by
decreasing  costs  and  improving  efficiency,  integration  and  lifespan  of  the
equipment.

• The lack of hydrogen infrastructure must also be addressed.

Do  you  have  any  suggestions  for  what  might  be  done  to  overcome  those
barriers?

The  government  is  supporting  the  development  of  solar  and  hydrogen  tech-
nologies.  We  would  advise  increasing  this  investment  and  setting  out  a  clear  vi-
sion—a  bold  national  strategy—with  specific  milestones  that  lead  towards  a  clean
and renewable energy economy.

Specific steps that can be taken include:
Solar:

• Build on current federal incentive structure (starting 2006).
• Support State and local governments that are underwriting incentives.
• Promote  certainty  with  the  incentives  so  businesses  can  invest  properly,

thereby encouraging long-term planning.

• Attract  domestic  manufacturing  of  photovoltaics  and  solar  energy  system

components.

• Work with utilities to reduce impediments to on-site power generation.

Æ Introduce time of use power accounting that charges customers the mar-
ket  value  of  electricity.  For  example,  power  during  a  hot  summer  day  is
in  greater  demand  (air  conditioning)  and  therefore  more  expensive.  This
is  also  when  solar  panels  are  producing,  they  are  load  following.  There-
fore people might turn off equipment, or switch to solar.

• Support market mechanisms like Green tags and emissions credits that work

to account for the externalities of fossil fuels combustion.

Hydrogen:

• Develop a national strategy to move towards a hydrogen economy.

to account for the externalities of fossil fuels combustion.

How  do  you  see  the  competition  itself  as  helping  to  move  both  solar  and
efficiency technologies into the mainstream building market?

This  high-profile  competition  had  a  deeply  positive  impact  on  helping  to  move
solar  and  efficiency  technologies  into  the  mainstream  building  market.  The  core
challenge  of  the  Solar  Decathlon  is  to  build  a  beautiful  and  energy  self-sufficient
home. At our school, this challenge inspired over 100 students and faculty from the
architecture, engineering, interior design, and communications departments to work
together  to  integrate  a  design  vision  with  engineering  and  construction  realities.
The knowledge and experience gained from this project will carry with us as we be-
come  the  next  generation  of  leaders  in  our  respective  fields.  The  multiplier  effect
extends  this  impact  from  all  the  Decathletes  to  our  families,  friends,  donors,  and
colleagues.

Through fundraising and PR efforts, our ideas were shared with many leading fig-
ures  in  the  building  and  energy  fields,  in  addition  to  countless  homeowners.  While
still at school, people from the community would stop by the site and ask how they
too  could  use  solar.  While  on  the  National  Mall  during  the  event,  the  flow  of  peo-
ple—and the interest they had in solar and efficiency technologies was breathtaking.
Everyone wanted solar today.

This  high-profile  platform  also  enabled  us  to  pursue  and  fund  the  hydrogen  fuel

cell energy storage system—a vital demonstration project.
What  sources  of  information  did  you  draw  on  to  figure  out  how  to  build
your house?

The team drew upon the vast knowledge of our own students and faculty to build
our house. Many times we collaborated with private businesses—construction, archi-
tecture,  engineering  firms—and  we  found  many  willing  partners  in  our  community
and  beyond.  People  were  ready  to  support  this  cause.  For  the  Solar  panels  and  the
hydrogen  fuel  cell  system,  we  looked  to  private  companies  and  training  courses  to
assist us with the installation of the systems. The USMMA’s Alternative Power Pro-
gram also had specific experience with hydrogen fuel cells.
What  problems  arose  in  designing  or  constructing  your  house  that  sur-
prised you?

The  team  encountered  a  number  of  challenges  throughout  this  process.  Funding
this  project  was  a  constant  struggle.  While  there  are  grants  available  for  specific
lines of research, there should be more available for this type of system integration
and interdisciplinary endeavor.
Would  your  house  be  commercially  viable?  If  not,  what  changes  would
make it more attractive to the mainstream home buyers?

With solar power and energy efficient design technologies, it often comes down to
a cost/benefit analysis: Is the upfront investment worth the long-term benefits? The
NYIT  house  with  the  hydrogen  fuel  cell  system  is  not  commercially  viable  today—
though this is what we are working towards. The solar electric, and solar hot water
systems,  and  energy  star  appliances  are,  partly  because  of  the  incentives  that  our
local utility, the Long Island Power Authority, offer.

The design concept of the house, the site specific dwelling and the modified ship-
ping  container  with  internal  mechanics  and  power  systems  has  many  applications
in  addressing  general  housing  and  energy  problems  across  the  world.  The  Green
Machine  contains  everything  needed  for  survival  and  connects  to  any  type  of  ‘‘Blue
Space’’  with  photovoltaics  to  gather  solar  power.  In  tandem  the  two  parts  work  to-
gether  as  one  self-sustaining  unit.  It  is  then  supported  by  furniture  and  interiors.
The  benefit  of  a  locally  designed  and  built  dwelling  place  is  that  it  provides  the
inhabitants  with  a  feeling  of  comfort  and  ownership.  In  addition,  local  energy  pro-
duction brings peace of mind to homeowners and to our country.

DISCUSSION

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
We  will  now  turn  to  Members’  questions,  and  I  will  recognize

myself for five minutes.

Join  the  club  in  having  to  address  the  issue  of  fundraising.  It  is
a—I think it is a problem everywhere, but—and obviously all of the
teams  had  to  raise  a  lot  of  money  to  design  and  to  build  and  to
transport  your  houses.  That  seems  to  be  something  that  was  very
apparent  in  all  of  the  photographs  that  we  saw  and  everything.
And there was no monetary or other prize, other than the recogni-
tion and publicity for winning the competition.

So  what  motivated  your  teams  to  participate?  And  were  there
any  obstacles  to  the  participation,  maybe  other  than  the  fund-
raising?

Mr. Schubert.
Mr. SCHUBERT. Well, I think a project of this nature is a natural
for  us  to  be  involved  with.  It  kind  of  drew  students  and  faculty  to
it.  I  think  by  having  it  done  once  in  2002,  there  was  already  kind
of  acknowledgment  and  visibility,  and  so  it  really  wasn’t  difficult
to recruit students to it. And it, again, is one of these projects that
allows an interdisciplinary approach to it, and I think the students
appreciate being able to work with others across colleges.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
Mr. Lyng, you said that, you know, three years of your life—what

motivated your team to participate?

Mr.  LYNG.  I  think  for  other  members  of  the  CU  team,  certainly
myself,  and  I  can’t  imagine  it  is  terribly  different  for  other  team
members,  it  was  a  drive  to  do  the  right  thing.  And  I  would  echo
what—Mr. Schubert’s comment. It was not hard to get students in-
terested. It was hard to get students—to keep student interest, be-
cause it was a very difficult project to work on. It is a huge amount
of time commitment. Fundraising was not a trivial thing for under-
graduate  and  graduate  engineers  and  architects.  These  are  not
MBA students. Getting the house here from Colorado was a sincere
difficulty. And staying here in DC for four weeks, away from class-
es.  Those  were  the  real  legitimate  difficulties.  But  despite  all  of
that,  we  had  20  students  from  the  University  of  Colorado  come
here to participate.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Mr. Knowles.

Mr.  KNOWLES.  I  think  it  was—our  motivation  was  primarily  to
embed issues of sustainable design and alternative energy practices
in  our  curriculum.  The  Chair  of  my  department  was  whole-
heartedly behind the project as we tried to develop our curriculum
to  tackle  these  issues,  and  this  is  the  perfect  project  for  that  in
terms  of  building  and  having  firsthand  experience  with  designing
something—students  designing  something—building  something
they actually designed.

Again,  you  are  going  to  hear  this  all  day,  the  department  was
fully behind it, but when it became time for fundraising, it is a sig-
nificant  amount  of  money,  and  it  was  very  difficult,  with  other
funding  issues  going  on  on  campus,  to  have  the  entire  school,  you
know, put their full efforts behind this project.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. A lot of bake sales.
Mr.  KNOWLES.  Phone-a-thons,  et  cetera,  pleas,  begs.  So  that
was—but  that  was  really  our  primary  concern,  and  to  continue  to
strengthen  our  department  in  terms  of  issues  of  sustainability,  as
Colorado was—has already done.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Mr. Schieren.
Mr. SCHIEREN. I think that, for our team, opportunity to work on
a  problem,  there  is  just  acknowledgment  that  there  is  a  problem,
many  problems  that  we  have  to  address,  but  spearheaded  by  the
architecture  department  setting  out  a  vision,  a  philosophy  from—
for making improvements from—for—and I think students felt that
they  had  a  direct  hand  in  making  progress.  So  the  people,  the  key
team members, I said there were well over 100 people at our school
and  our  partnership,  but  the  key  people,  say  20  to  30  people,
worked  tirelessly  on  this.  And  the  truth  is  that  it  is  very  chal-
lenging, but I think that satisfaction only comes when you do a lot
of  hard  work  and  you  have  actual  results.  So  people  were  ex-
tremely committed, and still are.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
Just quickly, Mr. Moorer, what kind of research activities can be
incorporated into the—such a competition for the Solar Decathlon?
And  what—are  there  advantages  to  having  the  research  incor-
porated in there?

Mr. MOORER. Well, Madame Chair, if I may——
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Um-hum. Sure.
Mr. MOORER.—respond a little bit to some of the——
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Um-hum.
Mr.  MOORER.—comments  that  have  been  made  so  far,  I  would
say  that  I  appreciate  the  comments  from  the  other  witnesses,  and
we  certainly  take  the  students’  comments  quite  seriously.  We  do  a
survey at the end of the competition. We certainly consider how we
might  change  and  improve  the  competition,  which  we  are  already
planning to do for next time. And while some of the suggestions are
very  good,  we  really  prize  the  real  estate  that  we  are  allowed  to
use  for  these  competitions.  As  you  can  imagine,  being  on  the  Mall
is  a  fantastic  place  to  be  able  to  conduct  this.  There  are  some
issues  related  to  trying  to  do  a  grid-connected  contest  there,  but
this is something that we would certainly be willing to consider.

With  respect  to  this  issue  of  research  and  development,  to  some
degree,  the  students  are  doing  that  already.  I  would  tell  you  that
a huge benefit out of this competition is the integration that begins

to  happen  between  the  work  that  goes  on  and—things  like  photo-
voltaic  research  and  development,  and  actually  how  do  you  inte-
grate  that  into  building  design.  That  has  been  a  missing  compo-
nent,  if  you  will,  within  some  of  our  own  programs  at  the  Depart-
ment,  and  this  is  one  way  that  we  see  to  achieve  this  integration.
And that is an important part of the research and development pic-
ture.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
My time is expired.
The gentleman from California, Mr. Honda.
Mr. HONDA. Thank you, Madame Chair.
And  I  guess  Mr.  Moorer,  you  answered  a  couple  of  the  concerns
that Mr. Lyng had brought up as far as his three observations, and
I think that they are well thought out and they are probably issues
that we should be looking at in the future.

To  Mr.  Lyng,  I  just  want  to  let  you  know  that  Congressman
Udall would have been here, but he is still en route back from Col-
orado, so I just wanted to make sure you knew that.

Your  comments  about  east-west  orientation,  it  sounded  a  little
like  feng  shui,  and  that  is  just  a  comment.  You  don’t  need  to  re-
spond.

But  I  am  curious—my  sense  is  that  you  raised  somewhere  be-
tween  $200,000,  $300,000,  $400,000  to  have  this  project  completed
and  brought  over  here,  and  we  made  some,  you  know,  light  re-
marks  about  fundraising,  but  where  does  your  money  come  from?
Did  it  come  from  developers  or  any  other  sources  that  made  some
sense?  And  then  once  your  projects  are  completed,  what  do  you  do
with it? Do you auction it off? Do you sell it to some rich guy that
maybe  can  reimburse  you  for  your  costs?  Or—it’s  like  4–H,  you
know, you get it back. And I also appreciated your comment about
being  a  solar  patriot,  and  I  think  that  is  a  term  we  may  want  to
coin,  because,  you  know,  being  a  hydrocarbon  man  for  decades,  I
am prepared to be a solar patriot.

So if you wouldn’t mind answering that question, Mr. Lyng, and
then  to  the  rest  of  the  Members—the  rest  of  the  witnesses,  what
is—I heard some barriers mentioned. What are some of the strate-
gies  that  could  be  applied  to  solving  the  problems  so  that  the  uni-
versity-level students can really pitch in and be worried about com-
ing  up  with  ideas  rather  than  worrying  about  spending  time  rais-
ing  money?  Being  an  elementary  school  principal,  we  spent  a  lot
of  time  raising  money  selling  cookies  and  jewelry  to  send  kids  to
science  camp.  When  we  invested  in  our  students  through  the  Dis-
trict Office and through, you know, our monies, we found that stu-
dents were able to concentrate more on their studies than anything
else.

So I would appreciate some response, starting with Mr. Lyng.
Mr. LYNG. Yes, thank you, Mr. Honda.
I won’t hold it against Congressman Udall for not being here.
Mr. HONDA. I will let him know.
Mr.  LYNG.  First,  to  answer  your  question  where  did  the  funding
come  from,  for  our  project,  it  came  from  a  number  of  different
sources.  About  10  months  ago,  we  entered  into  a  contract  with  a
developer  in  Colorado  for  the  pre-sale  of  the  home.  And  that  was
about B  of our budget. The rest of our funding came from organiza-

49

tions  such  as  the  Home  Builders  Association,  who  is  our  single
largest cash sponsor, private sponsors, but over half of our funding
was  in  in-kind  donations.  And  it  is  my  feeling  that  if  students
had—if  everyone  had  the  same  project  funding  level  in  cash,  and
teams were asked to purchase the best products on the market, not
the  ones  that  they  could  get  donated,  then  we  would  see  very  dif-
ferent  homes.  And  I  think  that  really  does  drive  design  more  than
any of us would like to admit. Fundraising was an enormous obsta-
cle.

What will happen to our house after? It has come back to the CU
campus  where  it  will  be  used  for  outreach  and  education  for  the
next  eight  months.  And  then  it  will  go  to  Prospect  New  Town  in
Longmont,  Colorado,  which  will  be  its  final  location.  It  will  be  en-
gaged in a long-term instrumentation and monitoring effort by the
National  Renewable  Energy  Lab,  and  then  it  will  eventually  be
sold.  Someone  will  actually  live  in  this  house.  For  some  people
touring the house, they thought that that was quite incredible, but
it will be occupied.

Mr. HONDA. And just a quick question for all of you.
I  noticed  in  the  photos  that  the  solar  panels  that  are  used  ap-
peared  to  be  the  old  style  where  it  is  all  fixed  and  it  is  pretty
heavy.  Has  any  thought  or  any  access  to  some  of  the  new  photo-
voltaic  plastics  and  other  kinds  of  materials—were  they  available?
Or were they even considered, in the area of nano?

Mr.  MOORER.  Right.  No,  there  were  no  schools  that  were  using
what we would call nanotechnology, if that is where you were going
with  that  particular  question,  but  we  did  have  some  schools  that
were  using  thin  film  technology,  which  there  are  some  companies
out  there  that  are  manufacturing  it.  It  does  look  promising,  on  a
cost basis. Right now, there is an interesting situation in the photo-
voltaic  market  where  there  is  a  shortage  of  silicon.  Basically  crys-
talline silicon is the workhorse of this industry today. And as a re-
sult of that, with conventional, typical PV systems, the prices have
gone  up,  supplies  are  a  little  tight,  and  you  are  seeing  some  of
these  other  technologies  make  it  into  the  marketplace,  and  yes,  a
few schools did try those technologies.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
The gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Bartlett.
Mr. BARTLETT. Oh, thank you very much.
Let  me  first  ask  a  follow-up  question  about  the  silicon.  The  thin
film, is there any limitation in materials for making the thin film?
Mr.  MOORER.  No,  sir,  I  don’t  believe  so.  We  view  rather  tremen-
dous potential for PV, and there are, of course, more than one type
of thin film, but there should not be an issue with that.

Mr. BARTLETT. So the only thing limiting our production there is

our manufacturing capacity?

Mr.  MOORER.  Manufacturing  capacity  and  other  barriers  that
face  the  entire  PV  industry.  Certainly  cost  is  a  big  factor,  but
things  like  reliability,  manufacturability,  and  efficiency  of  the  sys-
tem; these are all important factors.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  The  silicon  now  is  down  to  something  less  than
$5 a watt retail. Where are we with the thin film? Are we competi-
tive?

Mr. MOORER. Yes. Excuse me. They are in the same range at this

Mr.  BARTLETT.  Yeah.  Thin  film  is  not  quite  so  efficient  so  you

point. Yes.

need a bigger surface?

Mr.  MOORER.  Well,  when  you  are  talking  about  something  like
cadmium,  that  is  not  too  far—they  are  not  too  far  apart  at  this
point.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  Yeah.  But  the  fact  that  they  are  not  as  efficient
per square foot really doesn’t matter. We have a big globe with lots
of  room  for  putting  solar.  The  fact  that  it  is  not  quite  as  efficient
I don’t think is an impediment to going that way.

I  am  sorry  I  couldn’t  be  here  for  your  testimony,  but  I  did  visit
your  exhibits  on  the  Mall  with  considerable  interest,  because  in  a
former  life,  I  was  a  homebuilder,  and  most  of  the  homes  I  built
were passive solar homes. I live in a passive solar home. I have a—
really more than one building, several dwellings that are totally off
the  grid,  isolated,  and  the—beyond  the  grid  in  the  mountains  of
West Virginia, so I have a lot of experience with solar.

Your  projects  were,  I  think,  more  important  than  you  and  your
students  realized,  if,  indeed,  the  world  is  facing  the  phenomenon
called  ‘‘peak  oil.’’  Most  of  the  energy  used  in  our  society  is  used  in
buildings.  We  are  focused  more  on  transportation,  because  that  is
where  the  big  threat  is  with  oil,  but  there  is  enormous  capabili-
ties—potential for reducing energy use in buildings. And what you
all are doing with your programs year after year is very helpful in
familiarizing the American people. And what you are doing with—
is  just  plain  fun,  the  challenge  of  making  these  things  with  this
technology,  I  am  sure,  challenges  your  students.  And  I  saw  the
large number of people who went there.

I  just  wanted  to  thank  you  for  doing  this.  In  the  years  to  come,
all of these things that you are now pioneering are going to become
increasingly  popular  and  prominent  in  the  homes  that  we  are
building,  because  as  we  run  down  the  other  side  of  Hubbard’s
Peak,  there  is  going  to  be  an  ever  greater  and  greater  demand  for
having  comfortable  homes  using  less  and  less  energy.  And  you  are
contributing  to  that,  and  I  want  to  thank  you  very  much  for  doing
that.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. The gentleman yields back.
The gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Lipinski, is recognized.
Mr. LIPINSKI. Thank you, Madame Chairman.
I  want  to  echo  the  comments  of  my  colleagues  in  thanking  you
for  the  work  that  you  have  done.  It  is  really  critical  for  us,  and  I
think back to when I was in eighth grade, for eighth grade science
fair  projects,  so  it  was  26  years  ago,  I  did  a  solar-powered  radio.
Back in the ’70s, there seemed to be a big emphasis, coming off of,
I  think,  the  first  big  oil  crisis.  There  seemed  to  big—be  a  big  em-
phasis then on renewable energy, especially solar energy.

Today, my question really is it is great to see everything that you
have done in the Solar Decathlon and what can be done, but where
are we really with moving forward with really starting to see these
implemented  on  a  large-scale  basis?  I  know  that  some  of  this  is
done to a lesser extent, some of the more simple solar, such as the
passive  solar  homes,  are  done,  but  what  is  the  next  step?  Where
do  you  see  this  going?  Do  you  see  this  taking  off?  And  what  does

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 07:52 Mar 23, 2006 Jkt 024150 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ENER05\110205\24150 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

it  need?  What  kind  of  incentives  do  people  need  in  order  to  start
using  more  of  this?  Is  it  really  feasible  in  terms  of  the  cost  to  do
this, to start putting these—to start seeing more of this in individ-
uals’ homes?

So  that  is  a  big  question,  but  I  sort  of  want  to—that  is  where
I  come  down  to  you.  You  know,  it  is  great  to  see  this.  Where  are
we going? And are we going to see this in the near future?

Whoever wants to start.
Mr. Moorer.
Mr.  MOORER.  I  just  might  point  out  that  some  of  the  witnesses
made  reference  to  the  importance  of  various  policy  drivers  such  as
tax  policy,  and  I  would  say  certainly,  with  the  recent  passage  and
signing  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005,  that  certainly  has  some
important  provisions  in  it  to  help  this  industry  out,  and  that  is  a
key piece of the puzzle.

Clearly  advancing  the  research  and  development  is  key  as  well,
and  we  see  a  lot  of  potential  there  to  continue  driving  the  cost
down. The systems are not in widespread use now for a number of
reasons,  alluded  to  earlier,  but  cost  certainly  is  a  huge  factor  in
seeing  a  broader  use  of  the  technology.  But  that  is  something  that
has  come  down  quite  dramatically  in  the  last  several  decades  and
continues to drop as we continue to work on the technology.

Mr. LIPINSKI. Okay. How much further do we have to go in order
to—is  there  any  sense  of  how  many—how  long  it  is  going  to  take?
I  know  for  each  different—there  are  so  many  different  aspects  of
each  of  these  homes,  but  what  do  you  see  being  sort  of  the  first
widespread usage? Which aspect of these homes?

Mr. SCHIEREN. Well, I would speak to, just briefly, the solar. Let
us  talk  about  the  solar  panels  and  the  use  of  solar.  We  are  from
New  York,  and  specifically  Long  Island.  The  Long  Island  Power
Authority,  one  of  our  main  supporters,  offers  incentives.  In  fact,
they  buy  back  about—buy  down  about  half  the  cost.  They  share
about half the cost of an installation. With that incentive, the pay-
back  is  usually  10  years.  So  there  is  a  large  up-front  investment,
but  the  payback  is  10  years.  And  with  rising  energy  prices,  many
people are interested. So growth rates are rather good. And in fact,
in the charter today’s—for the—today’s hearing, it says, I think PV
shipments  are  so—are  increasing  about  35  percent  a  year.  So  it  is
growing  quite  fast.  States  that  offer  incentives,  utilities  that  offer
incentives  are  experiencing  very  high  demand.  So  I  think  growth
is there right now.

Mr. KNOWLES. I would just like to reinforce that point, as an ar-
chitect in the northeast. Just personally, most New England States,
New York included, offer very generous incentives: half price, basi-
cally, whether it is a direct grant or a tax incentive to pay for half
of  the  system.  But  each  state  has  different  rules,  and  this  is  what
I  added  in  my  testimony  to  answer  the  questions.  And  I  think  the
Federal  Government  could  either  advertise  or  streamline  those
rules  to  make  the  accessibility  to  the  public  much  easier.  For  in-
stance,  in  New  York  State,  there  is  a  large  organization  and  dif-
ficult to penetrate. In Rhode Island, it is actually a small and very
generous  fund  that  is  available  that  helped  us  out.  So  I  think  the
Federal  Government  would  have  a  role  in  sort  of  merging  these

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 07:52 Mar 23, 2006 Jkt 024150 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ENER05\110205\24150 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

52

programs nationwide in advertising that these are available to the
public. And then I think it will take off.

Mr. LIPINSKI. Okay. Anyone else want to——
Mr. SCHUBERT. I would think that, in addition to economic incen-
tives,  we  need  more  good  examples  of  how  these  technologies  are
integrated that do not require a radical departure from individuals’
lifestyles, things that are reliable, transparent to the user, and that
their  designed  from  the  ground  up,  not  designed  in  such  a  way
where they are just applied as an afterthought.

Mr.  LIPINSKI.  It  would  seem  to  me  that—you  had  mentioned
about  people  who  came  and  saw  these  were  very  interested.  When
they go home, are they really going to have—where are they going
to  find  out  more?  Or  what—do  you  really  see  them  taking  another
step?  Where  does  that  take?  It  seems  like  these  are  not  things
that—they probably look at it and say, ‘‘Oh, that is really cool,’’ but
that  is  not  practical,  because  they  don’t  see  it  anywhere  else  be-
sides, you know, out in the special project like this.

Mr.  SCHUBERT.  Well,  I  think—we  stressed  conservation  above
and  beyond  anything  else.  And  I  think  what  people  saw  there  on
the  Mall,  they  got  motivated  and  excited,  and  the  first  thing  that
we  would  tell  them  to  do  is  to  go  back  and  invest  in  conservation.
And  then,  once  they  had  done  that,  then  the  additional  tech-
nologies might make sense for them to do. But I think it is through
this  excitement  factor  you  get  them  motivated  to,  you  know,  pay
attention to what they are currently doing, how their existing hous-
ing stock can be improved. And there is a wide range of strategies.
But—and with a glimpse of what it could be, it helps to, you know,
go back and look at what they do have and then kind of bring that
along.

Mr. LIPINSKI. Do we have time for Mr. Moorer?
Mr.  MOORER.  I  just  wanted  to  add  the  fact  that  in  this  year’s
competition,  getting  to  your  point,  Congressman,  we  actually  had
an  expo  running  concurrently  with  the  Decathlon  so  that,  just  to
your  point,  if  someone  came  in  and  got  excited  about  the  tech-
nologies,  we  could  arm  them  with  information  and  point  them  to
a  place  where  they  could  actually  talk  to  manufacturers  and  in-
stallers right there, not too far away from the site of the Decathlon,
to take it further, if they were personally interested.

Mr. LIPINSKI. I thank all of you for your work on this.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
I  have  just  a  couple  of  other  questions,  I—if  other  Members

would like to, also.

Just  a  couple  things.  We  are  talking  about  solar,  and  all  I  can
think  of  is,  you  know,  that  you  have  got  the  sun  coming  in,  and
a lot of you showed how you would be—the windows were set back
so that you wouldn’t get the hot sun in the summer, but then there
are some that used the sun for—the winter sun. All I can think of
is my fabrics, and you know—if you don’t have the E-glass or what-
ever, but it also, you know, warms the house, but it is—how do you
deal with that? Just have a very modern house with furniture that
doesn’t  fade  in  the—either  the  summer  or  the  winter?  I  mean,
that—maybe  that  is  a  woman’s  thing,  but  it  is  a—or  a  decorator.

Nobody wants to tackle that? Do we have——
Mr. KNOWLES. No, it is—I will take a stab.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Okay.
Mr. KNOWLES. We never—we intended to actually have some cur-
tains in front of our large face—large south-facing glass wall. That
glass  wall  actually  completely  disappeared.  It  pivoted  open  so  the
whole inside and outside were connected, but we never, you know—
with  time,  never  got  to  that  sort  of—that  very  simple,  talk  about
conservation  strategy,  just  robust  curtains  on  the  south  windows
that,  you  know,  cuts  the  energy  coming  into  the—very  simple
means.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. But that really isn’t what I wanted to ask,
but  just  talking  about  the  transportation,  it  seemed  like  that  was
a  real  project,  and  the  houses  really  had  to  be  built  to  fit  the  size
of  a  transport,  or,  you  know,  even  though  it  might  be  in  pieces,  it
still  is  limiting  for  this  contest.  And  what  was  it?  Eight  hundred
square feet, about? Was that the maximum?

How, then, would this—the type of houses that you built be used
as  a  model  for—you  know,  for  a  home  that  really  is—would  be  a
normal-sized,  comparable  to  the  average  single  family  home?
Would there be any changes from what you have designed?

Mr.  LYNG.  That  is—that  question  is,  I  think,  very  on  point  with
the  800-square  foot  limitation.  I  think  that  is  something  that  we
all  battled  with.  And  certainly  transporting  the  homes  is  no  small
task,  getting  them  from  Spain  or  Puerto  Rico.  Who—they  are  not
here,  but  they  could  tell  you  what  a  difficulty  that  was.  I  think
many of the members of the public that toured the homes could en-
vision  that  they  would  be  bigger,  that  you  could  add  another  bed-
room  or  perhaps  a  detached  garage.  The  NAHB,  according  to  the
NAHB,  the  average  size  of  a  new  home  purchase  in  the  United
States is now 2,200 square feet, so we are well under that with 800
square feet. For some families, that could be a problem. But it was
my  experience  that  members  of  the  public  saw  the  homes  as  a
model and saw how it—they could be expanded in size.

Chairwoman  BIGGERT.  After  looking  at  a  lot  of  the  houses,  I
would  say  that  the  majority  of  them  are  very  scaleable  and  that
they  were  dealt  with  in  a  modular  way  so  that  they  could  be  ex-
panded.  And  when  you  think  about  the  energy  production  compo-
nents on the buildings themselves and you look at the base energy
loads  of  the  building,  they  are  not  that  far  off  from  the  energy
loads that you would see in a conventional house. So I think the—
you  would  still  have  the  same  size,  maybe  a  little  bit  larger  in
terms  of  the  energy  collection  components,  so  it  is  just  that  there
is some flexibility in terms of how the spaces could be added to.

Mr.  Moorer,  what  we  face  in  this  committee  a  lot  is  how  we  get
from  the  basic  science  to  the  application  and  then  to  the  commer-
cialization of what is coming out of our national labs or, you know,
the  basic  research.  How  would  you  compare  the  Decathlon’s  bene-
fits  to  technology  transfer  versus  the  other  means  the  Department
uses to push the energy technologies into the mainstream market?
Mr.  MOORER.  Well,  I  think  it  depends  on  what  part  of  the  spec-
trum  we  are  talking  about,  because  you  articulated  it  very  well:  it
runs  from  basic  research  all  of  the  way  to  a  commercial  product.
I  like  to  think  of  it  as  from  an  idea  all  of  the  way  to  a  product  in
the marketplace, and I think you apply different tools all along the
way.  And  I  think  this  particular  competition  is  a  good  mechanism

to use in this part of the spectrum, if you will. Generally speaking,
the  students,  for  the  most  part,  the  schools  are  using  what  I  will
call  off-the-shelf  technology,  but  they  do  employ  some  innovative
technologies,  and  I  would  say  that,  in  that  context,  they  are  doing
a  good  job  of  showing  how  one  might  be  able  to  integrate  these
technologies.  And  tech  transfer,  you  know,  I  think  you  can  argue
about what do we mean when we say technology transfer. We have
major cost-shared efforts with industry where one might say, ‘‘Well,
that  is  a  form  of  technology  transfer,’’  but  that  is  much  more  re-
lated to research, pure research and development, where here it is
more  about  outreach,  if  you  will,  and  some  of  the  goals  that  I  al-
luded  to,  trying  to  introduce  these  technologies  to  people  that  are
at  the  very  beginning  of  their  careers  and  making  choices.  And  so
I think it is very effective in the space that we use it in.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you. Thank you.
Mr. Honda, do you have any——
Mr. HONDA. Yes.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. You are recognized. The——
Mr. HONDA. Thank you, Madame Chair.
Chairwoman BIGGERT.—gentleman is recognized.
Mr. HONDA. Thank you, Madame Chair.
And  I  guess  that  that  is  what  Mr.  Lyng  was  sort  of  eluding  to
that  if  they  had  cash  versus  in-kind,  you  know,  they  may  be  able
to apply more of the up-front technologies that may exist out there,
or may even, you know, just transfer some of that technology to the
housing.  And  maybe  the  Department  of  Energy  can  look  at  a  cash
pot  that  the  students  can  apply  for  rather  than  going  for,  you
know, in-kind kinds of help.

My question is kind of a follow-up to the Chairperson’s question.
Sections 917 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, there is a provision
that  originated  in  this  committee  to  establish  a  number  of  ad-
vanced energy efficiency transfer centers around the country to ac-
complish much of what the decathlon does in Washington and then
more.  Are  you  familiar  with  this  bill?  And  if  you  are,  what  prob-
lems or opportunities do you see in implementing this provision?

Mr.  MOORER.  I  am  sorry,  sir.  I  am  not  familiar  with  that  par-

ticular provision.

Mr. HONDA. Okay.
Mr.  MOORER.  I  will  say  this.  It  may  not  be  a  surprise  that  my
particular  office  has  a  rather  large  share  of  the  provisions  that
were  provided  in  the  Energy  Policy  Act,  and  we,  right  now,  are  in
the business of analyzing all of the provisions that have been made
available  to  us  and,  in  fact,  are  making  some  decisions  about  how
to go forward on a number of those.

Mr. HONDA. There may be a response. You are right there.
Mr. MOORER. Yes, it is one of the provisions that is subject to ap-
propriations.  We  do  have  a  number  of  provisions  in  this  new  law
and of course the law came along after we had submitted our 2006
budget request.

Mr. HONDA. Right.
Mr.  MOORER.—request,  so  the—it  is  not  there  now,  and  like  I

said, we are looking——

Mr. HONDA. Right.

55

Mr. MOORER.—at all of those provisions to decide what we might

ask for in subsequent budget requests.

Mr.  HONDA.  And  then—so  having  said  that,  it  is  gearing  up  for
the  appropriations,  because  it  has  been  authorized,  I  imagine,  to
the universities and to the proponents and students. You may want
to  dedicate,  next  year,  of  working  towards  making  sure  that  there
is  an  appropriation  to  the  tech  transfer  and  then  see  how  some  of
these appropriations can be allocated towards the decathlon and its
use,  because  it  is  highlighting  this  whole  arena  of  alternative  en-
ergy  uses.  And  I  suspect  that  a  lot  of  your  technology  and  a  lot  of
your ideas can be used by groups like FEMA where there are over
173,000 folks who are displaced from their homes that can use, not
only temporary housing, but modular housing that you may be able
to  come  up  with  that  will  take  advantage  of  solar  power  and  take
them—make  them  part  of  the  grid  rather  than  just  be  dependent
upon the grid.

So  that  would  be  a  recommendation  and  suggestion  you  may
want  to  look  at.  You  know,  it  is  just  me,  you  know,  talking,  but
you know, there may be some cash there.

Chairwoman  BIGGERT.  Mr.  Lyng,  in  his  testimony,  talked
about—or  a  quote  from  Richard  Nixon  in  1973,  which  I  think  is
very  apropos,  that  says,  ‘‘Let  us  set  as  our  national  goal,  in  the
spirit  of  Apollo,  with  the  determination  of  the  Manhattan  Project,
that by the end of this decade we will have developed the potential
to meet our own energy needs without depending upon any foreign
energy  source.’’  Well,  he  didn’t—we  haven’t  made  it  with  that  dec-
ade, but I think that this committee is very committed to really re-
duce  dramatically  our  dependence  on  foreign  energy  sources  and
are working on all different types. You know, we have talked about
the hydrogen car, nuclear energy, solar, hydro, and I think that we
appreciate how you are contributing to being able to reduce our de-
pendency and appreciate all of you for participating in this.

I  would  love  to  have  all  of  the  graduate  students  that  are  here
stand  up  so  we  can  take  a  good  look  at  you,  if  you  would,  please.
And  undergraduates.  Oh,  I  didn’t  mean  to  say  just  graduate  stu-
dents. I am sorry. All of the—so we congratulate all of you for what
you  have  accomplished,  and  we—I  wanted  to  see  your  faces,  be-
cause  I  know  we  will  be  probably  seeing  more  of  you  in  the  years
that  come  as  you  develop  the  energy  sources  that  we  need.  And
thank you for all that you have done.

And  I  would  like  to  thank  the  panelists  for  testifying  before  the

Subcommittee today.

If there is no objection, the record will remain open for additional
statements  from  the  Members  and  for  answers  to  any  follow-up
questions the Subcommittee may ask the panelists.

Without objection, so ordered.
And this hearing is now adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 3:20 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Richard F. Moorer, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Technology Develop-
ment, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, U.S. Department of En-
ergy

Questions submitted by Chairman Judy Biggert
Q1. You  mention  in  your  testimony  that  the  American  Institute  of  Architects  (AIA)
is  a  sponsor  of  the  Decathlon.  What  commitment,  if  any,  has  the  AIA  given  the
Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  to  educate  AIA  members  on  the  issues  associated
with  the  utilization  of  the  designs  employed  in  the  structures,  the  technologies
used and the conservation measures employed by the students?

A1. The  AIA,  through  its  sponsorship  of  the  Solar  Decathlon,  has  helped  educate
its  members  on  solar  and  energy  efficiency  issues.  The  AIA  uses  its  Committee  on
the  Environment,  whose  purpose  is  to  advance  and  disseminate  environmental
knowledge and values, to advocate the best design practices for solar and energy ef-
ficiency  building  integration.  The  Association  was  a  contributor  to  the  Decathlon’s
outreach  to  industry  professionals  such  as  architects,  engineers,  builders  and  other
trades  who  were  invited  to  come  down  to  the  Solar  Decathlon  village  and  learn
about  cutting  edge  building  and  solar  technologies.  The  AIA  also  gave  its  members
Solar Decathlon coverage in its publications leading up to and during the event.
Q2. What  outreach,  outside  of  the  Decathlon,  has  DOE  undertaken  to  educate  the
builder-developer community on the utilization of the technologies and conserva-
tion measures demonstrated at the Decathlon? What has been the response from
the  community?  Do  you  have  indications  that  you  are  making  real  inroads  into
this community, especially with respect to reducing perceived risks of using new
technology,  or  are  you  mainly  communicating  with  those  whose  philosophies
agree with the DOE?

A2. The  Department  is  working  with  the  Nation’s  home  builders  to  implement  re-
newable  and  conservation  technologies  under  the  Department’s  Zero  Energy  Home
effort. The builder-developer community has been interested in adopting and install-
ing  several  technologies  utilized  in  the  Solar  Decathlon,  such  as  photovoltaics,  en-
ergy  recovery  ventilation,  and  solar  water  heating  technologies.  The  Department’s
recent  outreach  efforts  have  improved  communication  with  the  builder-developer
community  and  resulted  in  an  increase  in  their  understanding  and  acceptance  of
solar  building  technologies.  In  fact,  in  2004,  home  builders  utilized  renewable  and
conservation  technologies  on  more  than  300  zero  energy  homes  across  the  Nation,
as well as on thousands of conventionally-powered homes, across the Nation.
Q3. You say in your testimony that you are attempting to use the Decathlon to com-
municate the benefits of these technologies to a wider audience. What other audi-
ences are you attempting to reach and how are you doing it?

A3. The  Solar  Decathlon  appeals  to  a  wide  range  of  audiences,  including  builders,
students,  architects,  and  the  general  public.  This  year,  more  than  120,000  people
visited the Solar Decathlon during its ten days on the National Mall in Washington.
The  outreach  activities  carried  out  by  the  Department  of  Energy  and  its  private
sector  Solar  Decathlon  partners  succeeded  in  attracting  widespread  interest  in  the
competition.  The  2005  Decathlon  offered  visitors  a  variety  of  ways  to  learn  about
energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  technologies,  including  publications,  exhib-
its,  workshops  and  tours.  In  addition,  the  competition  included  specially  designed
programs for builders and students.

Finally, the extensive media coverage of the 2005 Solar Decathlon in newspapers,
magazines,  television  and  on  the  Web  has  helped  inform  people  about  energy  effi-
ciency  and  renewable  energy  technologies  that  are  available  for  use  in  residential
housing.
Q4. What  is  solar  energy’s  relative  piece  of  the  energy  research  pie?  How  does  DOE

form long-term plans to direct investments in this area?

A4. The  Department  of  Energy  is  spending  a  combined  total  of  approximately  $1.5
billion in FY 2006 on applied energy research and development (R&D) programs in
the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the Office of Electricity, the
Office  of  Nuclear  Energy,  and  the  Office  of  Fossil  Energy.  (This  estimate  was  cal-
culated by combining program-level funding data and includes deployment activities
sponsored  by  each  program  classified  as  an  R&D  program.  It  excludes  program  di-
rection.) Of that amount, $83.1 million in FY 2006 is for Solar Energy Technologies.

59

In  FY  2007,  we  propose  a  substantial  increase  in  spending  on  Solar  Energy  Tech-
nologies to $148 million.

The  Solar  Energy  Technologies  Program’s  Multi-Year  Program  Plan  guides  long-
term investments in solar research. The plan was developed through a collaborative
effort of many experts in the solar energy field and has been reviewed by industry.
A public version of the 2007–2011 plan is scheduled for release in 2006.

In  general,  the  Solar  Program  develops  its  long-term  investments  by:  1)  identi-
fying  key  market  segments  for  solar  technologies;  2)  determining  market  and  tech-
nical  barriers;  3)  developing  pathways  to  overcome  or  reduce  such  barriers;  and  4)
defining technical targets to track program progress.
Q5. Section  917  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  is  a  provision  that  originated  in
this  committee  to  establish  a  number  of  Advanced  Energy  Efficiency  Transfer
Centers  around  the  country  to  accomplish  much  of  what  the  Decathlon  does  in
Washington and more. Are you familiar with this provision the bill? If so, what
problems  or  opportunities  do  you  see  in  implementing  this  provision?  Do  you
know if DOE is planning to request funding for this program in the President’s
Budget Request for FY 2007?

A5. I  am  familiar  with  Section  917  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  (EPAct).  The
Department  stands  ready  to  establish  a  network  of  Advanced  Energy  Efficiency
Transfer  Centers  in  the  event  that  funds  are  appropriated  by  Congress  for  such  a
purpose.

The  FY  2007  budget  is  under  development.  We  are  currently  considering  the
issues  and  opportunities  associated  with  promoting  greater  use  of  energy  efficiency
technologies by consumers.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Robert  P.  Schubert,  Professor  and  Team  Faculty  Coordinator,  College

of Architecture and Urban Studies, Virginia Polytechnic Institute

Questions submitted by Representative Michael M. Honda
Q1. Do  the  ten  criteria  used  to  judge  the  Decathlon  seem  to  be  reasonable?  Do  you
have any suggested modifications to the criteria to make the competition a more
‘‘real-world’’ experience?

A1. For  the  most  part,  the  ten  criteria  provide  a  reasonable  metric  for  the  evalua-
tion of a complex set of issues related to the subjective/objective performance of the
Solar Decathlon projects. While we have seen the criteria of evaluation evolve from
the  previous  competition  in  2002,  we  feel  there  is  one  area  that  still  needs  signifi-
cant  improvement,  contest  element  nine,  ‘‘Energy  Balance.’’  To  be  more  representa-
tive  of  a  ‘‘real-world’’  situation,  a  grid-intertie  system  would  be  strongly  rec-
ommended. Upon completion of the 2002 Solar Decathlon competition, this was sug-
gested  to  the  organizers  as  a  more  effective  means  of  representing  how  a  building
would  operate  within  the  context  of  a  neighborhood.  As  it  stands,  the  houses  are
being  evaluated  as  a  series  of  autonomous  buildings  independent  of  any  benefits  of
being interconnected to a utility network. The current energy balance evaluation of
the  houses  is  more  representative  of  an  isolated  beach  house  or  mountain  cabin
where there would be no other means of supplying power. The majority of U.S. pop-
ulation  is  located  within  reach  of  a  local  utility  network  allowing  the  benefits  of
interconnection for a grid-intertie system to be realized for a renewable energy sys-
tem.  This  would  allow  costly  batteries  to  be  either  eliminated  or  significantly  re-
duced.  This  would  also  allow  the  Solar  Decathlon  projects  to  operate  thorough  any
type  of  weather  condition  experienced  during  the  event  without  necessitating  shut-
ting the houses down as was experienced during this last competition. The Virginia
Tech team felt this sent the wrong message to the public while the houses were op-
erating  during  this  long  period  of  inclement  weather.  A  better  approach  would  be
to  interconnect  each  house  to  an  on-site  local  utility  network  where  each  house
would  be  independently  metered  to  measure  the  amount  of  energy  either  supplied
or  withdrawn  from  the  grid.  We  recognize  that  while  providing  a  simple  metric  of
performance  for  energy  balance,  it  would  necessitate  more  on-site  preparation  and
associated costs for DOE. We feel strongly that whatever the cost, it would be worth
sending  the  correct  message  to  the  public  that  renewable  energy  systems  are  reli-
able and that reasonable contingencies can be taken during inclement weather.

If for some reason a Solar Decathlon grid-intertie system cannot be reasonably im-
plemented on the National Mall, and battery storage seems to be the only solution,
a  penalty  should  be  applied  for  those  competitors  who  use  more  energy  than  they
generate during the duration of the competition.
Q2. Based  on  what  you  know  about  the  Department  of  Energy’s  (DOE)  energy  effi-
ciency  and  renewable  energy  programs,  what  changes  should  DOE  make  to  its
programs to provide the knowledge and support you need to be an effective advo-
cate for the technologies and design philosophies you have used?

A2.

• Increase visibility and awareness of renewable energy systems and conserva-

tion strategies above and beyond what is currently being done.

• Special  linkages  should  be  made  with  university  programs—architecture,  in-
dustrial  design,  landscape  architecture,  mechanical  and  electrical  engineer-
ing—to  offer  special  summer  courses  for  high  school  students  interested  in
studying  at  the  university.  The  course  content  should  include  energy  issues
within the context of solar energy.

• Increase  public  awareness  by  creating  a  National  Awards  Program  for  solar

design.

• Provide  design  assistance  through  regional  centers  that  promote  the  use  of
solar energy (similar to agricultural extension programs) working in conjunc-
tion with state energy offices.

• Promote a residential based LEED assessment (LEED–H) currently under de-

velopment by the U.S. Green Building Council.

• Develop  continuing  education  programs  working  with  professional  organiza-

tions such as the American Institute for Architects.

Q3. What are the biggest barriers to the utilization of the design philosophies, energy
production technologies and conservation techniques facing the architectural and
builder-developer  communities?  How  do  you  overcome  the  perception  of  risk  in
utilizing new techniques and technologies?

A3.

• One  challenge  is  the  negative  public  image  of  solar  technology  as  something
that  is  ugly,  unreliable  and  costly.  The  integration  of  the  technology  within
new  and  existing  construction  as  achieved  by  talented  designers  should  be
promoted.
• Large  scale  builders  and  the  building  industry  in  general  are  conservative
and  unwilling  to  change  a  model  that  has  been  financially  successful.  The
building  industry  needs  to  anticipate  better  changing  energy  markets  and
consumer preference for efficiency. A program designed to link large manufac-
turers  of  housing  and  research  universities  involved  in  solar  energy  research
should be explored.
• Issues of energy efficiency without compromise to quality of life should be pro-
moted  in  concert  with  solar  energy.  The  Virginia  Tech  house  established  a
very compact, efficient plan that offered a psychologically expansive space.
• Risk  can  be  overcome  by  presenting  to  the  public  instances  of  solar  tech-
nologies  that  does  not  compromise  expected  life  styles.  The  Solar  Decathlon
holds this promise. Perhaps a longer term exposition should be established at
another  site  highlighting  the  best  houses  of  the  competition  and  allowing  for
a more rigorous testing and evaluation period.

Q4. To  the  extent  that  you  are  familiar  with  building  codes  and  standards  around
the  country,  generally  how  much  of  a  barrier  do  you  believe  current  codes  and
standards  are  on  the  development  of  the  concepts  and  technologies  you  have
used in your houses?

A4. Largely, we do not see building codes and standards as a major impediment to
the  deployment  of  renewable  energy  sources.  However,  codes  and  standards  could
be used to encourage and promote more widespread use of these technologies. Public
apprehension, weak precedent, and lack of demand are the greater barriers.

• The  most  prominent  model  building  energy  standards  (International  Energy
Conservation  Code  (IECC)  and  the  Model  Energy  Code  (MEC) )  that  are  the
basis for most local and State codes give little attention to solar technologies,
especially how solar and energy efficiency can work together.
• ENERGY STAR and Green Building (e.g., LEED) certification protocols go be-
yond  these  basic  codes,  as  do  several  custom  State  and  local  codes  such  as
those  in  California  (revised  Title  24),  Florida,  Oregon,  and  Washington,  and
in  Davis  (CA),  Boulder  (CO),  and  Austin  (TX).  Still,  even  these  innovative
codes  and  standards  need  to  integrate  better  efficiency  standards  and  solar
technologies for maximum cost-effectiveness.

Q5. What are your perspectives on the future of solar energy research? Is the Federal
Government  providing  sufficient  support  to  feed  the  research  workforce?  If  not,
what are budding energy researchers doing upon graduation?

A5. The Federal Government needs to increase its support for solar energy research
and  application.  Further  incentives  need  to  be  established  to  break  the  inertia  of
the  status  quo.  Installing  solar  energy  equipment  is  seen  as  a  financial  and  tech-
nical risk. Support in the form of tax incentives, credits, low interest loans, and util-
ity  credits  beyond  those  provided  in  the  2005  Energy  Policy  Act  are  necessary  to
mitigate public apprehension.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Jeffrey  R.  Lyng,  Graduate  Student  and  Team  Project  Manager,  Civil,

Environmental, and Architectural Engineering, University of Colorado

Questions submitted by Representative Michael M. Honda
Q1. Do  the  ten  criteria  used  to  judge  the  Decathlon  seem  to  be  reasonable?  Do  you
have any suggested modifications to the criteria to make the competition a more
‘‘real-world’’ experience?

A1. Most  of  the  Solar  Decathlon  (SD)  contests  are  relevant  and  necessary  to  flush
out  superior  elements  of  design.  However,  one  important  reality  that  the  ten  con-
tests do no address is life-cycle cost. An accurate accounting of the construction, op-
eration  and  maintenance  costs  associated  with  each  project  would  elucidate  the
‘‘real-world’’  potential  of  each  team’s  design.  I  firmly  advocate  for  the  creation  of  a
‘‘Life-Cycle Cost’’ contest in which teams compete for the overall least cost. The eco-
nomic  viability  of  Zero  Energy  Homes  (ZEH)  is  a  question  that  remains  central  to
the public’s interest and one which the SD must seek to answer.
Q2. Based  on  what  you  know  about  the  Department  of  Energy’s  (DOE)  energy  effi-
ciency  and  renewable  energy  programs,  what  changes  should  DOE  make  to  its
programs to provide the knowledge and support you need to be an effective advo-
cate for the technologies and design philosophies you have used?

A2. The  DOE  Building  America  (BA)  program  is  an  invaluable  resource  which  has
not  been  leveraged  by  the  SD  competition.  A  partnership  between  BA  teams  and
local SD teams holds great potential toward ZEH designs that appeal to the general
public.  The  BA  program  should  serve  as  a  springboard  of  basic  building  science
knowledge from which SD teams incorporate their own innovation and ingenuity to
ZEH design. Working in this manner, SD teams will benefit from the knowledge and
experience of BA professionals, while BA teams stand to benefit from the creativity
and fresh perspective of working with SD teams.
Q3. What are the biggest barriers to the utilization of the design philosophies, energy
production technologies and conservation techniques facing the architectural and
builder-developer  communities?  How  do  you  overcome  the  perception  of  risk  in
utilizing new techniques and technologies?

A3. It  has  been  my  experience  from  interaction  with  custom,  semi-custom  and  pro-
duction builders in Colorado that the greatest perceived risk associated with energy
efficiency  and  renewable  energy  technologies  is  higher  capital  costs.  Internalizing
the  external  environmental  costs  of  standard  and  alternative  building  methods  is
the only way to truly evaluate their viability. Simple payback period affords neither
a  complete  nor  truly  objective  means  for  comparison,  yet  it  remains  a  metric  com-
monly  referenced.  A  ‘‘Life-Cycle  Contest’’  in  the  SD  competition  is  a  real  and  tan-
gible step toward the true economic comparison of standard and alternative building
practices.
Q4. To  the  extent  that  you  are  familiar  with  building  codes  and  standards  around
the  country,  generally  how  much  of  a  barrier  do  you  believe  current  codes  and
standards are to the deployment of the concepts and technologies you have used
in your houses?

A4. The  only  product  used  in  the  CU  Bio-S(h)IP  which  required  testing  and
verification were the bio-base structural insulated panels, or Bio-SIPs. For example,
the  entire  solar  electric  array  used  UL-listed  equipment  and  was  installed  as  per
the National Electric Code (NEC). The Colorado Division of Housing deemed the CU
Bio-S(h)IP  a  site-built  manufactured  home,  thereby  obligating  the  CU  team  to  a
self-inspection process.

Many  of  the  products  used  in  the  CU  SD  entry  are  common  building  materials,
therefore current building codes and standards pose relatively modest challenges to
the widespread deployment of the Bio-S(h)IP concept. The Bio-S(h)IP will be perma-
nently  located  in  Longmont,  CO  were  it  currently  meets  local  building  codes  and
standards.
Q5. What are your perspectives on the future of solar energy research? Is the Federal
Government  providing  sufficient  support  to  feed  the  research  workforce?  If  not,
what are budding energy researchers doing upon graduation?

A5. Recent  budget  cuts  to  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory  (NREL)  in
Golden,  CO  leave  me  with  a  bleak  perspective  on  the  future  of  solar  energy  re-

search.  This  example  is  strong  evidence  that  the  Federal  Government  is  not  doing
enough to support a renewable energy research workforce.

Students of renewable energy are drawn by an insatiable desire to affect positive
environmental change. They are not attracted to the field by research assistantships
or other incentives. In fact, few such opportunities exist. Many of my colleagues are
unable to find competitive employment in the renewable energy field and must com-
promise  with  more  traditional  jobs  within  architecture  and  engineering.  A  discour-
agingly few high quality professional jobs exist in the renewable energy today in the
U.S.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Jonathan  R.  Knowles,  Professor  and  Team  Faculty  Advisor,  Depart-

ment of Architecture, Rhode Island School of Design

Questions submitted by Representative Michael M. Honda
Q1. Do  the  ten  criteria  used  to  judge  the  Decathlon  seem  to  be  reasonable?  Do  you
have any suggested modifications to the criteria to make the competition a more
‘‘real-world’’ experience?

A1. The  majority  of  contests  make  sense  but  a  couple  of  criticisms  come  to  mind
concerning the electric car and the timing of the event. First, the ‘‘Getting Around’’
contest is incompatible with the ‘‘Energy Balance’’ contest. To run the car sacrifices
the  performance  of  the  house,  as  power  needs  to  be  diverted  from  one  task  to  the
other. This is especially detrimental to the teams that are trying to be efficient and
frugal  by  having  the  least  amount  of  photovoltaic  panels  and  batteries.  The  teams
that  won  the  electric  car  contest  lost  the  energy  balance  contest  yet  they  had  the
most  photovoltaic  panels.  The  electric  car  contest  demands  a  large  solar  array  not
necessary  for  the  operation  of  an  800  square  foot  house.  We  support  the  idea  of
hooking up the houses to a temporary ‘‘grid’’ to measure any access energy available
once the other competition requirements have been satisfied.

Second, the timing of the event has two flaws: none of the decathlon submissions
fit into the academic calendar and there was not enough time to test the house once
assembled in Washington, D.C. Each submittal was due in the middle of the semes-
ter or in the middle of the summer, which made it difficult to plan the course work
necessary  to  complete  the  requirements.  The  submittals  should  revolve  around  the
academic calendar and not vice versa. Also, the contest should be held before school
starts—the  last  week  of  August  and  the  first  weeks  in  September.  Students  need
to  keep  up  with  their  course  work  during  and  after  the  competition  but  a  mid-se-
mester timeframe does not help. Finally, an extra week should be added to the com-
petition to allow the ‘‘bugs’’ to be worked out before the houses are open to the pub-
lic.  This  would  have  the  added  benefit  of  allowing  teams  to  tour  the  houses  and  to
learn about each other’s work.

Though  not  specifically  asked,  we  would  like  to  suggest  that  the  Department  of
Energy  raise  the  caliber  of  judges  and  the  forums  for  the  juries.  In  general,  the
judges  were  neither  interesting  nor  enlightened  and  the  award  presentations  were
too brief to be meaningful. As our students are designing housing using state-of-the-
art technologies, the best in the field should be available to evaluate (and have the
time) to discuss the projects in detail. Better juries will elevate the debate and will
attract more participation.
Q2. Based  on  what  you  know  about  the  Department  of  Energy’s  (DOE)  energy  effi-
ciency  and  renewable  energy  programs,  what  changes  should  DOE  make  to  its
programs to provide the knowledge and support you need to be an effective advo-
cate for the technologies and design philosophies you have used?

A2. Specifically,  the  DOE  could  do  a  better  job  advertising  the  event,  both  to  the
general public and to prospective competitors and they need to follow up on the tre-
mendous efforts given by the students. There are three simple solutions, all of which
require more financial backing by the DOE: promote the teams that have competed
in the past by inviting them on a nationwide lecture circuit, publish the competition
in  book  form  for  national  release,  and  embed  the  competition  within  inter-school
conferences,  such  as  the  Association  of  Collegiate  Schools  of  Architecture  (ACSA).
A small group of the 2005 Decathlon teams are currently working on this last point
within the academic community but the DOE should be spearheading this effort.
Q3. What are the biggest barriers to the utilization of the design philosophies, energy
production technologies and conservation techniques facing the architectural and
builder-developer  communities?  How  do  you  overcome  the  perception  of  risk  in
utilizing new techniques and technologies?

A3. The  biggest  barriers  are  cultural  inertia  and  education.  We  did  not  invent  the
technologies  that  we  used  with  RISD  Solar;  our  innovation  was  their  combination
and  integration.  Everything  we  used  is  available  in  the  marketplace.  However,  the
United  States  does  not  promote  solar  technologies,  which  are  currently  expensive
relative to fossil fuels. As long as the United States subsidizes the use of fossil fuels,
the  solar  industry  will  not  be  a  viable  option  for  the  architect  or  client.  If  this  sce-
nario were reversed, there would be a boom in the market that would reduce these
costs  and  begin  to  move  the  Nation  towards  energy  independence.  All  is  needed  is

a  little  push  from  the  Federal  Government.  Finally,  good  design  eliminates  risk.
Most  of  the  housing  industry  does  not  employ  architects  or  engineers  nor  adheres
to  strict  energy  standards.  If  these  practices  were  national  requirements  as  prac-
ticed  in  Europe,  risk  would  be  averted  because  professionals  would  back  up  their
systems.  Good  sustainable  design  requires  more  analysis,  a  design  process  that  in-
cludes  a  knowledgeable  team  and  project  commissioning.  The  nature  of  the  dis-
cipline  is  to  be  more  comprehensive  and  therefore  more  reliable  than  the  standard
mode  of  practice.  In  designing  our  house,  we  were  careful  to  make  our  systems  as
low-tech  as  possible.  The  more  sophisticated  our  design,  the  less  complicated  was
its operation, which is a sign of good engineering.
Q4. To  the  extent  that  you  are  familiar  with  building  codes  and  standards  around
the  country,  generally  how  much  of  a  barrier  do  you  believe  current  codes  and
standards are to the deployment of the concepts and technologies you have used
in your houses?

A4. Speaking  as  an  Architect  from  the  Northeast,  I  have  not  encountered  any  bar-
riers  when  dealing  with  building  codes  or  standards.  I  have  encountered  barriers
within  the  organizations  charged  with  promoting  and  funding  solar  energy  because
of  Byzantine  application  processes.  As  I  stated  in  my  testimony  to  Congress,  most
New England States offer very generous incentives, through direct grants or tax in-
centives to offset the cost of photovoltaic systems. But each State has different rules.
The Federal Government, through the DOE, could advertise these rules to make ac-
cessibility  to  design  professionals  easier.  The  Federal  Government  could  also  adopt
these same programs into a nationwide PV strategy.
Q5. What are your perspectives on the future of solar energy research? Is the Federal
Government  providing  sufficient  support  to  feed  the  research  workforce?  If  not,
where are budding energy researchers doing upon graduation?

A5. The  2005  Solar  Decathlon  project  allowed  over  100  students  at  the  Rhode  Is-
land School of Design and Brown University to understand the principles of sustain-
able  design  and  the  benefits  of  integrated  building  systems.  The  students  will  take
this expertise with them as they enter the profession and begin to influence clients
and  contractors.  For  this  reason,  RISD  is  planning  to  compete  again  in  2009.  The
2005  Solar  Decathlon  has  also  inspired  our  team  to  begin  planning  a  not-for-profit
research  institute  to  coordinate  all  work  relating  to  the  development  of  a  sustain-
able environment on campus, within Rhode Island and beyond. The Federal Govern-
ment  should  promote  this  type  of  institutional  investment  wherever  and  whenever
possible.  Our  institute  will  seek  funding  for  projects  in  urban  design,  material
science,  building  system  integration,  emergency  relief  shelters,  and  renewable  en-
ergy. The idea is to cross breed these topics to create friction and inspire innovation.
Eventually,  it  is  our  hope  to  be  self-sufficient  by  developing  and  selling  intellectual
property,  whether  ideas  or  products.  Early  governmental  support  would  make  all
the difference to capture the momentum already established on campus.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  David  G.  Schieren,  Graduate  Student  and  Energy  Team  Leader,  En-

ergy Management, New York Institute of Technology

Questions submitted by Representative Michael M. Honda
Q1. Do  the  ten  criteria  used  to  judge  the  Decathlon  seem  to  be  reasonable?  Do  you
have any suggested modifications to the criteria to make the competition a more
‘‘real-world’’ experience?

A1. In  general,  the  ten  contests  used  to  judge  the  Decathlon  seem  reasonable.
Should  there  be  modifications  to  make  the  competition  a  more  ‘‘real-world’’  experi-
ence?  First,  the  purpose  of  the  competition  should  be  defined.  The  purpose  largely
seems to be to drive system wide energy benefits by getting the public to use energy
efficiency  and  sustainable  design  strategies  and  clean  energy  generation.  The  stu-
dent  built  homes  should  epitomize  such  qualities  and  serve  as  benchmarks.  The
spinoffs  of  this  competition  are  for  people  to  ‘‘feel  and  touch’’  the  technologies  and
strategies  and  then  adopt  them.  Additionally,  participants  embrace  what  they
learned and implement energy efficiency and renewable energy throughout their ca-
reers.

The  Solar  Decathlon  is,  in  this  sense,  a  very  practical  demonstration  competition
in that the spinoffs can be realized in the near-term. The way the Decathlon is cur-
rently  judged  through  the  10  contests  reflects  this.  They  are  practical  contests  and
provide a ‘‘real-world’’ experience.

However, the NYIT team feels that there is perhaps another important component
to  the  competition  that  is  not  accounted  for  adequately.  The  10  contests  used  to
judge the competition do not directly include a way to reward innovative energy sys-
tems.  The  high  profile  of  this  competition  provides  for  an  opportunity  to  engage  in
slightly riskier research and development that could have a very positive impact in
the  medium  to  long-term.  For  example,  NYIT’s  home  featured  a  solar-hydrogen  en-
ergy  system,  the  only  one  of  its  kind  in  the  competition.  Power  from  the
photovoltaics  is  first  sent  to  the  house  to  cover  the  typical  electrical  loads.  Surplus
solar energy is then used to generate hydrogen gas, which is stored in tanks. When
there is no sunlight, the fuel cell converts the hydrogen gas into electricity to supply
the house loads. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a solar-hydrogen
system  has  been  integrated  and  demonstrated  in  a  functioning  house.  NYIT  knew
that  it  would  be  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  relative  other  teams  that  relied  on
the  traditional  battery  based  energy  storage  system,  because  the  current  efficiency
of the hydrogen system is lower.

With  significant  research  and  development,  the  hydrogen  home  will  one  day  be
superior  to  a  solar  home  that  uses  batteries  for  energy  storage.  Hydrogen  gas  is  a
versatile fuel that can be used throughout a home to cook food, heat water, generate
electricity and even power efficient fuel cell vehicles.

The  Solar  Decathlon  gave  us  the  platform  to  pursue  this  important  technology.
Partners  were  excited  to  work  with  us  because  it  was  such  a  high  profile  competi-
tion,  thus  providing  the  right  type  of  venue  to  conduct  technology  application  re-
search.  These  experiences  have  contributed  to  our  belief  that  innovation  in  energy
systems design should be rewarded in this competition.
Q2. Based  on  what  you  know  about  the  Department  of  Energy’s  (DOE)  energy  effi-
ciency  and  renewable  energy  programs,  what  changes  should  DOE  make  to  its
programs to provide the knowledge and support you need to be an effective advo-
cate for the technologies and design philosophies you have used?

A2. The  Department  of  Energy’s  (DOE)  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy
(EERE)  programs  engage  in  very  important  work  that  does  assist  us  in  our  efforts
to be effective advocates for the technologies and design philosophies we used in the
Solar  Decathlon.  It  is  apparent  that  the  purpose  of  the  EERE  programs  is  to  ad-
vance  clean  and  renewable  energy  technologies  directly  through  R&D  and  through
education, materials, outreach and various other methods. The NYIT team is reluc-
tant  to  pass  judgment  about  the  utility  of  the  current  programs  without  more  com-
plete information to conduct a proper cost/benefit analysis of the existing programs,
and the alternative opportunities to allocate resources.

What  can  be  said  is  that  we  have  directly  benefited  from  the  EERE  programs.

Solar Decathlon, Student Projects, and Demonstrations

First,  the  NYIT  team  has  benefited  enormously  from  participating  in  the  Solar
Decathlon,  a  DOE/NREL  competition.  Certainly  just  the  opportunity  to  have  first
hand  experience  building  energy  efficient  solar  homes  helped  us  learn  a  significant

67

amount. Furthermore, the Solar Decathlon gave us the opportunity to interact with
the public, government officials, industry and academia on clean energy, significant
in refining our knowledge and cultivating our advocacy skills. There were also direct
benefits from working with NREL.

Therefore,  we  support  continued  and  increased  support  of  the  Solar  Decathlon.
Additionally,  NYIT  supports  the  expansion  of  programs  aimed  at  the  application  of
new  strategies  and  technologies,  and  we  find  student  projects  to  be  particularly  ef-
fective. At our school, the Decathlon impacted over 50 students and faculty, in addi-
tion to countless friends, family partners and supporters. The students will grow to
become future leaders in the building and energy fields. The multiplier effect causes
affiliated people to consider energy efficiency and clean energy generation. Publicity
brings even wider attention. We would support increased efforts to get students and
academic programs involved. We would support increased investment in demonstra-
tion projects where the technologies that EERE funds are used. We would also sup-
port  the  EERE  seeking  feedback  from  students  and  the  people  who  design  and  in-
stall the technologies.
Clean Energy Products

A number of companies that we have worked with have been or currently are in-
volved with EERE research programs. Here we have benefited from improved prod-
ucts
Information

Furthermore,  we  have  benefited  from  the  abundant  information  and  educational
materials  made  available  from  the  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  pro-
grams.  The  team  has  and  continues  to  acquire  vital  information  and  knowledge
through the vast materials available on the website.

The  DOE’s  EERE  website  is  a  very  valuable  tool  for  communicating  the  results
and  information  gained  from  the  various  programs  and  we  support  the  continued
development of this resource. Brochures, reports and other materials made available
on the site are also very valuable. This will help us become better advocates.
Hydrogen

All decision-makers are faced with a scarcity of resources, and we respect that the
DOE must make rational and difficult budget choices based on cost/benefit analyses
and a variety of other factors.

EERE programs span a diverse range of technologies and this seems a smart way

to both encourage growth and mitigate risk.

Because  the  NYIT  project  involved  a  Solar-Hydrogen  system,  we  are  particularly
interested  in  and  have  specific  knowledge  of  the  Hydrogen,  Fuel  Cells  and  Infra-
structure  Technologies  Program.  This  program  follows  the  general  EERE  lead  in
that it invests in a wide array of technologies, basic research and outreach.

A  suggestion  might  be  to  concentrate  funding  on  renewable  and  clean  ways  to
generate hydrogen. There is currently an effort to focus on reforming fossil fuels for
hydrogen gas. We respect the vital role that fossil fuels have played in economic ex-
pansion and improved standards of living. We also respect that fossil fuels will con-
tinue to play a major role in our energy system. Even fossil fuel reforming systems
are  important  in  the  development  of  the  hydrogen  economy.  Since  reformation  is
currently  a  less  expensive  method  to  generate  hydrogen,  it  is  more  feasible  near-
term way to increase usage of fuel cell technology both in the stationary and trans-
portation sectors.

However,  we  are  more  interested  in  the  long-term.  Consider  a  future  of  true  en-
ergy  independence,  free  of  pollution  and  greenhouse  gases.  This  path  involves  re-
moving  fossil  fuels  from  the  equation  and  we  would  implore  the  EERE  programs
to concentrate efforts on this.

The  first  Portfolio  Priority  listed  in  the  Mission  section  of  the  EERE  website
states: PRIORITY 1: Dramatically Reduce or Even End Dependence on Foreign Oil.
Our  country  can  achieve  this,  and  we  will  continue  to  look  to  EERE  programs  to
help lead the way.
Q3. What are the biggest barriers to the utilization of the design philosophies, energy
production technologies and conservation techniques facing the architectural and
builder-developer  communities?  How  do  you  overcome  the  perception  of  risk  in
utilizing new techniques and technologies?

A3. There  are  several  barriers  to  the  utilization  of  efficient  design  philosophies,
clean  energy  production  technologies  and  conservation  techniques  facing  the  archi-
tectural and builder-developer communities.

One  major  barrier  is  that  trades  people  (i.e.,  engineering,  plumbing,  concrete/ma-
sonry)  lack  the  training  to  implement  energy  efficient  technologies  and  strategies.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 07:52 Mar 23, 2006 Jkt 024150 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\ENER05\110205\24150 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

68

The  experienced  people  in  the  field  receive  the  majority  of  current  business  and
training  programs  should  be  promoted  to  them.  There  are  certainly  training  pro-
grams  available,  but  often  times  it  is  costly  and  the  benefits  are  not  adequately
marketed. We are familiar with people who take ‘‘sabbaticals’’ from their professions
and  invest  a  significant  sum  to  gain  the  requisite  training  to  become  Energy  Star
qualified builders. This requires substantial risk and is preventing others from this
important pursuit.

Additionally,  clean  energy  technologies  often  require  collaboration  between  mul-
tiple trades. Consider a solar hot water production and radiant heating system that
requires the coordination of solar specialists, plumbers, masonry, etc. to design and
install. This example highlights the need to develop collaboration training.

Continuing  with  this  logic,  it  would  make  sense  to  widen  and  deepen  trade  asso-
ciation  outreach.  Trade  associations  are  powerful  advocates  and  could  have  broad
efficacy in this regard.

The  argument  in  support  of  training  holds  not  just  for  experience  professionals,
but  also  for  students  and  new  entrants.  The  point  is  that  training  the  people  who
do  the  actual  design  and  installation  is  an  integral  piece  of  the  puzzle  and  should
be  addressed.  Trained  and  educated  professionals  are  more  likely  to  utilize  new
technologies.

There  are  many  ways  to  overcome  the  perception  of  risk  in  utilizing  new  tech-
niques and technologies. One way is to invest in high profile demonstration projects
(e.g.  Solar  Decathlon)  so  that  people  can  become  familiar  with  the  technology.  Our
experience is that many people are now interested in the systems used in the NYIT
Solar  Decathlon  house,  even  though  it  is  still  considered  new  and  somewhat  risky.
Demonstration projects should be further supported and expanded.
Q4. To  the  extent  that  you  are  familiar  with  building  codes  and  standards  around
the  country,  generally  how  much  of  a  barrier  do  you  believe  current  codes  and
standards are to the deployment of the concepts and technologies you have used
in your houses?

A4. There are many codes and standards that govern the siting and usage of hydro-
gen  gas.  The  NYIT  team  went  to  great  lengths  to  ensure  that  our  hydrogen  house
was  up  to  code  and  could  be  sited  on  the  National  Mall.  In  one  sense,  it  is  very
good to undergo a rigorous safety review. However, it is well known that there must
be  further  convergence  of  hydrogen  codes  and  standards.  This  is  already  a  major
priority  for  the  DOE,  DOT,  other  governmental  agencies  and  private  organizations.
Beyond convergence of codes and standards, we would like to see a regulatory ap-
proach the puts hydrogen on a level playing field with other fuels, such as gasoline,
natural  gas  and  propane.  These  are  different  fuels  and  can  require  different  han-
dling. Nevertheless, efforts should be made to level the playing field.

This  is  one  of  the  largest  impediments  to  the  growth  of  the  hydrogen  economy.
We think it is a critical issue to address and therefore support dedicating significant
resources towards the effort.
Q5. What are your perspectives on the future of solar energy research? Is the Federal
Government  providing  sufficient  support  to  feed  the  research  workforce?  If  not,
where are budding energy researchers doing upon graduation?

A5. We  think  that  the  Federal  Government  should  provide  increased  support  for
solar energy research. It is unfortunate that the U.S. lost its dominance in solar en-
ergy  technology  to  other  countries.  Solar  energy  has  truly  great  potential,  and  can
have a dramatic and positive impact on the U.S. economy, national security and en-
vironment. It seems we are under investing in a technology that is so vital. Accord-
ing to the DOE’s EERE website, spending on photovoltaic research in FY 2004 was
approximately  $75  million.  We  would  like  to  see  a  greater  research  investment  so
that  the  U.S.  can  take  a  role  in  driving  the  next  generation  of  change  in  photo-
voltaic technology.

STATEMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND 2005 SOLAR DECATHLON TEAM

To: Chairman Biggert and the House Subcommittee on Energy
From: The University of Maryland 2005 Solar Decathlon Team
Date: November 2, 2005
About Our House

The 2005 University Maryland Solar Decathlon Team is a multidisciplinary team
of undergraduate and graduate students in the A. James Clark School of Engineer-
ing,  the  School  of  Architecture,  Planning  and  Preservation,  and  various  other  Uni-
versity schools. Our team is cumulatively 100 students. In the 2005 competition, we
received 8th place over all, but more importantly we received the BP Solar People’s
Choice  Award.  We  were  voted  the  best  house  by  visitors  who  came  to  the  National
Mall.

farm 

in  Germantown,  Maryland. 

Our home meets all Maryland State and Montgomery County housing code. It was
designed  this  way  so  the  beneficiary  of  our  house  after  the  competition  would  have
a fully-functional and up-to-inspection home. Our house was donated to a non-profit
community 
Farm
(www.redwiggler.org)  is  a  framework  for  adults  with  developmental  disability  to
learn  the  importance  of  self-sufficiency.  The  Maryland  house  will  be  used  as  staff
housing.  Currently,  it  is  temporarily  seated  at  Red  Wiggler  farm  awaiting  its  foun-
dation.

• 51  BP  Solar  4175  panels  in  two  panel  series  sets.  Each  can  generate  up  to
175  watts  of  electricity.  On  a  sunny  day,  our  array  is  capable  of  generating
8,750 watts of electricity.

• Three  OutBack  Power  Systems  PSPV  PV  combiners.  Each  PSPV  can  handle
12  strings  of  solar  panels  (our  panels  are  in  series  of  two,  so  each  combiner
handles 24 PV panels).

• Three OutBack Power Systems MX60 charge controllers. Each MX60 is rated
for 60 amps of DC output current and can be used with battery systems rang-
ing from 12 to 60 volts. Also important, our charge controllers were Maximum
Power  Point  Tracking  (MPPT)  charge  controllers,  meaning  it  is  a  more  effi-
cient charge controller than most.

• 40  East  Penn  Deka  8L16  batteries,  each  rated  to  hold  370  amp-hours  at  six
volts  (a  typical  car  battery  is  rated  for  12  volts,  and  usually  holds  40  amp-
hours  of  electricity).  These  batteries  where  arranged  in  five  parallel  sets  of
eight  batteries  in  series  to  create  a  48  volt  array  (six  volts  per  battery  8=48
volt  system.  370  AH/string  *  5  strings  =  1850  AH).  This  system  allowed  us
to maintain power during the rainy week.
• OutBack  Power  Systems  PSDC  DC  Disconnect.  For  safety,  homes  with  PV
power systems are required to have a main disconnect that separates the PV
system from the rest of the home’s electrical system.
• Four  OutBack  Power  FX3648  Inverters.  The  inverter  takes  in  DC  electricity
and makes it into AC electricity. Each inverter takes in 48 volts DC, outputs
120  volts  AC  at  30  amps  continuously,  and  can  handle  3600  watts  continu-
ously.  We  connected  them  in  a  series-parallel  connection  to  have  a  possible
240 Volts and 100 Amps of service.
• The  AC  Disconnect  is  where  the  AC  electricity  created  by  the  inverters  trav-
els  into  the  house.  When  the  home  moves  to  Red  Wiggler  Community  Farm,
it will have a connection to the electrical grid also.

Solar Hot Water

• Apricus  water  heating  tubes  provide  hot  water  for  the  house,  including  the
hot  water  for  the  radiant  floor.  The  tubes  absorb  the  sun’s  heat  in  an  insu-
lating layer of air-evacuated glass. While the outside of the tubes are cool, the
inside  the  tubes  can  exceed  300°F.  The  tubes  reduce  the  need  for  an  electric
or  gas  water  heater.  Our  system  includes  the  capacity  to  heat  water  with
stored electrical power when there is insufficient sunlight.

Plumbing

• Aquatherm  Fusiotherm  polypropylene  pipes.  This  piping  system  consists  of
green polypropylene pipes and fittings that are fused together with heat. This
process yields a seamless piping system with no joints to crack or break under
fatigue. Polypropylene is also more environmentally-friendly than comparable
home  piping  technologies.  The  most  widely  used  pipes  in  homes  today  are
made  of  PVC,  which  is  a  slightly  flexible,  white  plastic.  The  manufacture  of

PVC  involves  many  additive  chemicals  used  to  stabilize  the  PVC,  including
heavy  metals  such  as  lead,  cadmium,  barium,  and  zinc.  The  installation  of
PVC  piping  also  requires  the  use  of  toxic  glues  and  primers.  To  install
Fusiotherm  piping,  a  heating  tool  is  used  to  heat  the  pipe  and  fitting  where
the  pipe  is  going  to  be  inserted.  This  process  takes  approximately  two  min-
utes.  Next,  the  pipes  are  joined  together  by  hand  and  allowed  to  cool  for  ap-
proximately one minute. The joint is now fused, and the pipes are now ready
for  pressure.  Fusiotherm  fittings  are  available  in  a  wide  variety  of  sizes  and
types,  and  can  be  custom  manufactured  if  needed.  The  pipes  are  certified  for
both hot and cold potable water, and can be manufactured for both indoor and
outdoor  used.  Fusiotherm  pipes  have  been  in  use  for  many  years  in  Europe,
and were just recently certified for use in the United States.

Energy Recovery Ventilation

• Stirling  Technologies  UltimateAir  RecoupAerator  200DX  ERV.  This  unit  is
the  most  energy-efficient  and  best-performing  ERV  available  on  the  market.
ERV  devices  allow  exchange  of  air  with  the  exterior,  without  losing  heat  or
significantly  altering  the  interior  humidity.  The  ERV  exchanges  stale,  indoor
air  for  fresh,  outdoor  air  while  maintaining  the  home’s  temperature  and  hu-
midity levels.

Radiant Flooring System

• Warm  water  circulates  through  cross-linked  polyethylene  tubes  embedded  in
a  thin,  lightweight  three  inches  layer  of  gypsum  concrete  in  the  floor.  Heat
is conducted to the concrete layer, and then transferred to the interior air by
conduction  and  convection.  Because  warm  air  rises,  this  is  a  very  efficient
way  to  warm  a  house  evenly  without  using  forced  air  which  can  be  a  large
energy sink. In addition, the concrete can hold and release heat over a longer
period than wood (a principle known as thermal inertia).

Fire Protection System

• Sprinkler system that meet Montgomery and Prince George’s County (both in
Maryland)  code.  Montgomery  County  requires  that  all  new  residential  con-
struction have sprinkler systems, and we are the only house in the 2005 Solar
Decathlon that featured a fire protection system.

Natural Ventilation

• Window  placement  and  open  floor  plan  allow  a  cross-breeze  to  ventilate  the
house.  The  curve  of  the  ceiling  rises  toward  the  clerestory  windows  and  al-
lows rising warm air to be vented out. The house creates a natural convection
for cooling.

Insulation

• Our walls and floor are insulated with non-toxic spun glass fiber. The exterior
walls  are  framed  six  inches  thick,  rather  than  the  usual  four  inches.  The  R

value for the walls is 23. Our windows are triple-glazed, argon filled, with an
R value nearly as high as the walls.

Learning Experience

The  2005  Solar  Decathlon  could  not  have  come  at  a  more  opportune  time,  when
oil  and  gas  prices  are  at  record  highs.  Consumers  are  searching  for  alternatives  to
the  traditional  forms  of  energy  for  transportation  and  home  maintenance  to  allevi-
ate  the  stress  on  their  bank  accounts.  There  have  been  more  hybrid-fueled  vehicles
on  the  road  this  year  than  any  other.  Additionally,  because  we  as  a  society  are  be-
coming  more  environmentally  conscious,  alternative  energy  production  methods  are
becoming more and more attractive.

One major set back is cost in relation to the return on investment. Although solar
energy  is  available  now,  it  is  not  necessarily  cost  effective.  For  the  solar  panels  on
the  Maryland  house,  each  would  cost  consumers  $1000  to  produce,  at  a  maximum,
175  Watts  of  power.  There  is  also  the  cost  for  the  inverter  system  and  all  the  elec-
trical  systems.  In  order  for  a  photovoltaic  system  to  pay  itself  back,  it  might  take
up to 30 years, if not more. The payback time would, of course, depend on whether
the  solar  power  supply  is  being  used  to  replace  grid-supplied  electricity—currently
quite  cheap—or  natural  gas,  which  is  poised  to  become  very  expensive.  The  tech-
nology is not at a point that it is cost effective for everyday consumers and middle-
class  citizens  to  purchase  them  when  renovating  or  building  new  homes.  The  most
cost-effective  systems  featured  in  the  2005  Maryland  house  is  the  hot  water  tube
system.  A  typical  household  spends  30  percent  of  its  energy  budget  to  heat  water.
The  evacuated  tubes  are  approximately  80  percent  efficient  (versus  12–15  percent
for  PV  panels)  and  are  nowhere  near  the  cost  of  a  PV  system  (less  than  $5,000
versus over $60,000).

Important  issues  that  consumers  should  consider  are  the  cost  of  system  in  terms
of  dollars  per  watt  or  square  foot.  As  part  of  the  competition  rules,  our  house  was
limited to 800 square feet. Since most home owners are not limited to such a small
size,  they  could  purchase  less  efficient  PV  systems  than  our  house,  but  more  of
them.  When  making  decisions  on  the  Maryland  house  and  the  PV  system  we  used,
the  watt  per  square  feet  ratio  was  much  more  important  that  the  dollar  per  watt
ratio. To alleviate costs, consumers can use solar systems as supplemental systems.
In addition to hurdling the cost barrier, consumers must overcome the stigma that
solar energy is too difficult to obtain and install, and hard to maintain. Solar energy
needs  more  promotion  and  advertisement.  We  need  to  show  the  American  public
that  alternative  energy  is  available  ‘‘over-the-counter’’  and  is  ‘‘user-friendly.’’  If  the
government  promotes  the  use  of  alternative  fueling  in  public  arenas  and  environ-
mentally-friendly  building  techniques,  alternative  energy  will  become  a  part  of  our
everyday lives.

The  Solar  Decathlon  competition  has  been  instrumental  in  promoting  the  avail-
ability  and  attractiveness  of  solar  energy.  We  have  received  visits  from  politicians
on  Capital  Hill,  hundreds  of  news  reporters,  and  most  importantly,  hundreds  of
thousands  of  everyday  people  who  are  either  visiting  the  Washington  D.C.  area  or
live here and have heard about us. The tours that teams give to these visitors show
that these display homes are no different than what they themselves live in. By con-
necting  to  the  general  public  through  this  avenue,  it  is  the  best  way  to  reach  out
to  the  public.  Instead  of  lecturing  to  the  public  about  why  solar  energy  is  ‘‘good’’
and  how  easy  it  is  to  access,  we  bring  college  students—each  of  whom  are  them-
selves a consumer—and their homes to show that it really is that easy. We are able
to answer any questions on a personal level. The interactive aspect of this competi-
tion for the public is something that no other advertisement technique has.

We have also had the pleasure of having children visit our homes. Many teachers
in  this  area  have  learned  about  the  competition  and  required  students  to  visit  the
competition  as  an  assignment.  Elementary  level  students  have  come  in  groups  on
field trips. These students are the future. Showing them what solar and alternative
energy  is  on  an  interactive  level  is  something  that  no  teacher  or  class  session  can
provide.

This  competition  is  not  just  educational,  it  is  also  practical.  Its  objective  is  to
bring solar energy to the public, and it has achieved that on many levels. Each team
is required to submit information about the systems installed in their homes to the
competition holders. These are then publicized on the Solar Decathlon web site. Ad-
ditionally,  having  the  ‘‘communication’’  and  ‘‘documentation’’  categories  of  the  Solar
Decathlon  judging  requires  teams,  who  wish  to  succeed,  work  to  educate  the  public
about alternative energy.

On  another  level,  many  of  the  teams  have  worked  with  sponsors  who  are  local
contactors  and  builders.  For  the  Maryland  team,  we  have  worked  closely  with  the
Whiting-Turner Contracting Company and have received donations from Clark Con-

struction and the Lennar Company. These are large builders and contractors in the
local  region.  By  partnering  with  them,  we  are  not  only  educating  ourselves  about
the  construction  industry,  we  are  also  educating  them  the  availability  of  solar  en-
ergy  and  how  it  appeals  to  the  public.  Many  students  on  our  team  have  received
job offers from these companies and will eventually work with them. Hopefully, the
lessons  learned  from  this  project  will  continue  to  serve  these  students  in  their  ca-
reers (not to mention their employers!).
Resources and Problems

There  are  a  variety  of  resources  for  building  solar.  To  inspire  our  staff,  many  of
the  project  managers  visited  shows  and  conferences  across  the  country.  We  looked
internally to the professors, teachers, and alumni first for help. From there, we were
given  contacts  to  outside  contractors.  Each  step  of  the  way,  we  learned  and
networked. Either we found the answer we wanted or we came a step closer to what
we were looking for and found other sources.

Some  of  the  major  problems  with  designing  and  constructing  this  house  were  in
the  planning,  organization,  and  fundraising  aspects.  Because  the  students  involved
are  learning  every  step  of  the  way,  mistakes  are  made  left  and  right.  It  is  difficult
to  predict  the  future  with  little  or  no  experience  in  real  world  design  and  construc-
tion  experience,  let  alone  learn  while  doing  so.  Also,  we  found  that  although  many
companies  are  willing  to  donate  services  and  materials,  money  is  one  of  the  most
difficult  donations  to  receive.  It  is  also  one  of  the  most  important  elements  of  this
project.  It  was  surprising  how  fast  the  money  was  spent,  and  how  slowly  it  came
in.  Also,  many  of  us  were  frustrated  by  the  discrepancy  in  the  university  support
we  expected  and  received.  We  expected  that  the  Universities  would  promote  this
project just as much as their most profitable athletic games. However, few students
knew about the project, when the competition was held, or where it was held. Addi-
tionally, we along with many other teams received little support and understanding
from  our  professors.  It  was  assumed  that  this  was  another  school  project.  It  was
hard for professors to understand the breadth of what we took on. It would be help-
ful  if  participating  Universities  were  required  to  become  involved  and  partner  with
the Solar Decathlon Project. It not only promotes these Universities, alternative en-
ergy, but also will alleviate the stress on already overwhelmed students.
Attracting to Home Buyers

The  2005  Maryland  Solar  House  was  one  of  the  best-built  homes  in  the  competi-
tion in terms of craftsmanship and fit and finish. The quality of construction is im-
peccable and surpassed by very few of the other homes. There was a strict and high
level  of  quality  assurance  during  design  and  construction.  The  home  was  designed
for lifting up and also forces coming down because it had to be transported. (Upward
reinforcements are not necessary for homes that will not be transported.) The major-
ity  of  the  Maryland  home  is  build  from  wood  (60  percent  sustainably  harvested).  It
is  easy  to  manufacture  with  the  expertise  of  a  few  carpenters.  The  home  was  also
built  using  traditional  stud-frame  construction,  allowing  almost  any  builder  or  con-
tractor  to  make  it  without  learning  new  techniques,  which  sets  it  aside  from  other
homes  in  the  competition.  However,  the  design  has  to  be  changed  slightly  for  mass
production.  There  are  many  aspects  of  this  house  that  were  custom  constructed  for
the  competition.  For  example,  the  footers  and  posts  that  hold  up  the  house  are  not
necessary for a mass produced home, which ideally would have a permanent founda-
tion.  However,  because  this  house  is  built  to  have  two  levels,  one  for  storage,  it
lends itself to an addition of a fully functional basement if desired.

To  alleviate  costs  on  our  house,  home  owners  would  not  need  the  expensive  bat-
tery bank used for the competition. The PV system would be grid-tied. Additionally,
there  would  be  no  need  for  water  tanks  and  other  hardware  used  to  simulate  the
city  sewer  and  water.  The  Maryland  system  was  oversized  to  make  sure  we  were
ready  for  any  situation  during  the  competition.  Most  consumers  would  not  need  to
have  this  safeguard.  For  example,  we  would  realistically  only  need  two  inverters
and two charge controllers instead of four and three respectively.

STATEMENT OF THE VIRGINIA TECH 2005 SOLAR DECATHLON TEAM

Bright Ideas: Winning Teams and Innovative Technologies

from the 2005 Solar Decathlon

(Testimony  provided  to  the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives’  Science  Committee,
Subcommittee on Energy on Wednesday, November 2, 2005 by Robert Schubert, As-
sociate Dean for Research and Outreach, College of Architecture and Urban Studies,
Virginia Tech accompanied by Robert Dunay, Chair, Industrial Design Program and
Joseph Wheeler, Lead Faculty Advisor, Solar Decathlon Project.)
The Virginia Tech Solar House

The  Solar  Decathlon  of  2002  was  an  educational  watershed  challenging  the  rela-
tion  between  academia  and  practice  and  between  research  and  its  corresponding
contribution  to  society.  The  knowledge  derived  from  the  2002  competition  has  been
integrated  into  the  Virginia  Tech  house  of  2005  to  produce  a  work  that  combines
innovative  technology  and  daily  life  styles.  This  new  project  has  achieved  a  high
level  of  complexity  expressed  in  an  elegant  simplicity.  The  initial  theme  of  the  art
of integration has been realized through a design of a solar house that demonstrates
a  comfortable  living  and  working  environment,  excellence  in  sustainable  construc-
tion, and strong architectonic expression. The project presents forms that look to the
future embodied with a sense of the sustainable and the beautiful.
Mission

The  mission  of  the  Virginia  Tech  Solar  Decathlon  Team  is  to  inform  and  educate
the  public  about  issues  of  energy  (particularly  solar)  and  to  give  students  energy  ex-
pertise through a design-build process of innovative research and testing through ap-
plication.

Our multi-disciplinary team strives to achieve the following goals:

illustrate the energy consumption of daily activities.

• To  illustrate  how  solar  energy  can  improve  the  quality  of  life.  Solar
energy is clean; it significantly reduces pollutant emissions; and solar
energy is renewable, thereby increasing our nation’s energy security.
• To  make  the  public  aware  of  how  energy  is  used  in  their  daily  lives,  and  to

Beginning  of  Oral  Presentation  of  Questions  to  be  Addressed  in  the  Testi-

mony

Before  we  address  the  specific  questions  provided,  we  would  like  to  acquaint  you
with some of aspects of our building produced for the 2005 Solar Decathlon competi-
tion.

The  Virginia  Tech  Solar  house  integrates  technology  and  architecture.  The  house
achieved  a  balance  between  the  two  as  reflected  by  winning  the  juried  competition
elements  of  Architecture,  Dwelling,  Daylighting  and  tying  for  first  place  in  electric
lighting.

Some of the key features include:

• efficient  plan—The  house  is  comprised  of  a  small  (580  sq.  ft.)  rectangular
plan wrapped on three sides with a translucent skin and covered with a hov-
ering curved roof inclined toward the sun.
• floating  roof—The  particular  shape  of  the  roof,  a  lightweight  stressed  skin,
folded-plate filled with foam insulation, is designed to set the solar panels at
an optimum angle for energy collection and integrate the panels into the roof
form.
• north  core  module—A  thick  linear  core  defines  a  massive  north  wall  and
houses  the  batteries,  electrical  and  mechanical  equipment,  and  service  func-
tions  such  as  the  kitchen,  laundry,  storage,  and  closets.  Constructed  of  ex-

panded  polystyrene  panels  that  are  lightweight,  easily  assembled,  and  yield
a  high  insulation  value,  this  module  could  be  manufactured  separately  and
utilized in many applications.

• translucent wall assembly—Two layers of aerogel filled polycarbonate pan-
els transmit beautiful diffuse light while delivering an extremely high insula-
tion  value.  There  will  be  no  need  for  electric  lights  from  sunrise  to  sunset.
• tunable walls—Between the polycarbonate panels are three systems. A pair
of  reflective  and  absorptive  motorized  shades  allow  user  control  of  light  and
heat  transmission;  linear  actuated  vents  top  and  bottom  provide  ventilation
for further thermal control; and, dimmer controlled LED lights allow the user
to make the wall any color, no paint required.

• innovative  engineered  systems—our  energy  efficient  ground  source  heat
pumps  powered  by  the  solar  electric  panels  provide  environmental  condi-
tioning in the form of heating and cooling while delivering heat through a ra-
diant floor that offers the best in terms of efficiency and quality. There is lit-
tle  air  noise  or  movement  and  the  ambient  temperature  can  be  kept  lower
saving energy.

• transportation—A lowboy chassis serving as the floor and foundation struc-
ture was designed to receive a detachable gooseneck and rear axels for trans-
port. A truss on each side of the 48-foot span resists deflection while in tran-
sit and rotates down 90 degrees to create a deck surrounding the house when
stationary.

In response to the specific questions:

1. Some  of  the  main  technical  and  other  barriers  to  greater  use  of  solar  energy  are:

• Inertia of public perception towards the status quo
• Perception of increased complexity of new system vs. conventional systems
• Conservatism of building industry and their adversity to risk
• Cost—time of return on investment
• There are few new architectural ideas relative to new technology.
Some suggestions for what might be done to overcome those barrier are:

• Increased  incentives  for  solar  installations  such  as  tax  and  mortgage  incen-

tives, low interest loans, and utility credits

• Create a National Awards Program for solar design
• Encourage numerous and repetitive small-scale applications
• Regional centers that promote the use of solar energy (similar to agricultural

extension programs) working in conjunction with state energy offices
• Require utilities to generate a percentage of power from solar energy
• Federal  energy  subsidies  redirected  to  encourage  a  higher  percentage  of  re-

newable energy

• In addition to a week-long competition on the Mall, re-create the solar village

for a longer period in an Expo type of forum.

The Solar Decathlon Competition is an effective means to seed the potentials of solar
energy in the public consciousness.

• It  touches  people  from  all  walks  of  life  and  from  diverse  economic  and  social
backgrounds.  As  witnessed  in  the  competition  of  2002  and  2005,  there  is
widespread  and  growing  public  interest  in  solar  energy.  Integral  with  the
competition, all aspects of the house are considered with respect to conserva-
tion of energy. Particularly the Virginia Tech house, demonstration was made
that a solar dwelling can offer a desirable and rich lifestyle.

• Its competitive content activates top research universities to further their re-
search  efforts  and  to  draw  unique  collaborations  with  industry.  The  competi-
tion  allows  partnerships  to  be  formed.  Among  many  corporations,  Virginia
Tech  worked  with  GE  Specialty  Film  and  Sheet  and  Cabot  Corporation  to
produce a wall that delivers great light and high insulation. Likewise, collabo-
ration with California Closets has the corporation, for the first time, building
cabinet prototypes from a Dow Chemical wheat board that is sustainable and
non detrimental to the environment.

learned from other houses.

2. The Solar Decathlon of 2002 provided a wealth of information in our own experi-
ence of designing and building a house as well as observing the houses from other
research institutions.
• Our  2005  house  integrates  the  research  from  the  previous  work  and  lessons
• In  addition  to  on  campus  expertise,  a  network  of  manufacturers  and  profes-
• A student network researched a wide range of materials, processes and tech-
• The United States Green Building Council’s (USGBC) draft LEED Residential
program provides us with an outline to reduce indoor air pollutants, minimize
global  warming,  reduce  waste,  include  recycled  content,  represent  low  em-
bodied  energy  in  manufacture  and  harvest,  limit  destruction  to  habitat,  and
rapidly renew.

nologies, some of which were integrated into our design.

Two of the problems we encountered were:

• An  inordinate  amount  of  time,  energy  and  cost  associated  with  our  transpor-
• Percentage  of  time  utilized  to  raise  in-kind  donations  and  extreme  difficulty

in raising cash contributions.

3. Our house would be commercially viable:

• Placed within the context of commercially manufactured housing.
• Winning  the  Architecture  and  Dwelling  Awards  in  the  competition,  the  Vir-
ginia  Tech  house  demonstrated  its  appeal  to  a  discriminating  set  of  judges.
• The Virginia Tech Solar House offers various possibilities for components that

will conserve energy and improve the quality of residential building.

In conclusion, we would like to leave with this final thought:
We approach a watershed. Our lifetime has experienced an increased dependence
on  technology.  Almost  every  amenity  we  enjoy  is  dependent  upon  centralized  sys-
tems  whose  working  and  control  are  far  removed  from  localized  areas.  A  short  cur-
tailment of services sends neighborhoods and regions into temporary states of chaos.
In  the  recent  case  of  hurricane  damage,  available  supplies  of  gasoline  could  not  be
accessed due to lack of electrical service. Whether from natural disaster or terrorist
threat,  large-scale  technologies  have  exposed  growing  risks.  We  must  reduce  the
risk  of  widespread  technological  failure  by  providing  alternative  distributed  power
solutions  and  backing  up  centralized  systems  with  grass  roots  capability  of  gener-
ating  power.  With  continued  support  and  research  of  solar  energy,  this  vision  is
achievable for the next generation.
