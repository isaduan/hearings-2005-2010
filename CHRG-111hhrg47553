BACKGROUND

The  Nation’s  water  policy  remains  essentially  unchanged  despite  a  myriad  of  re-
ports recommending broad changes to address dwindling water supplies. Multi-year
droughts  continue  to  plague  regions  and  states  around  the  country,  including  the
Southeast,  Texas,  and  California.  For  many  municipalities,  intense  competition  for
water  and  diminished  supplies  will  force  local  water  agencies  to  make  tough  deci-
sions on water allocations including implementation of restrictions to protect essen-
tial ecosystem services.

Droughts,  changing  patterns  of  precipitation  and  snowmelt,  and  increased  water
loss  due  to  evaporation  as  a  result  of  warmer  air  temperatures  are  indicators  that
climate  variability  and  climate  change  have  impacts  that  are  being  felt  across  the
United States.1 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) latest re-
port  projects  that  water  supplies  stored  in  glaciers  and  snow  cover  will  decline  in
the  course  of  the  century,  thus  reducing  water  availability  in  regions  supplied  by
melt water from major mountain ranges.2

January  2009,  the  driest  month  in  California  history,  has  left  California’s  res-
ervoirs  and  rivers  operating  at  near  record  lows.  On  February  20,  the  Bureau  of
Reclamation  announced  that  a  large  percentage  of  agricultural  contractors  in  the
State  are  expected  to  receive  no  water  deliveries  this  year  due  to  California’s  ex-
treme  drought  and  municipal  contractors  should  count  on  receiving  a  50  percent  of
their  normal  supply.  The  Bureau  prepared  two  forecasts:  a  conservative  forecast
with  a  90  percent  chance  of  having  runoff  greater  than  forecasted  and  a  median
forecast with a 50 percent chance of having runoff greater than forecasted.

Recommendations for the Obama Administration

5

Last  fall,  the  Pacific  Institute’s  Dr.  Peter  Gleick  provided  water  policy  rec-
ommendations to the next Administration. Dr. Gleick’s priorities include developing
a  comprehensive  national  water  policy,  spotlighting  national  security  issues  related
to  water,  expanding  the  role  of  the  U.S.  in  addressing  global  water  problems,  and
integrating climate change into all federal water planning and activity.4

The  United  State’s  fresh  water  resources  are  used  ineffectively  due,  in  part,  to  a
lack of a national water policy. Dr. Gleick argues, ‘‘If inefficient use and water con-
tamination continue unabated, they will impoverish this and future generations, de-
stroy  the  limited  remaining  aquatic  ecosystems,  and  threaten  our  future  food  sup-
ply.’’ 5

In  developing  a  21st  Century  National  Water  Policy,  the  Pacific  Institute  rec-
ommends  a  reorganization  of  the  diverse  and  uncoordinated  federal  water  respon-
sibilities and expanding the collection of water-use and water-quality data. In addi-
tion, the Institute calls for the re-establishment of a new national, bipartisan Water
Commission  for  the  21st  Century  to  evaluate  and  recommend  changes  to  national
water policy.

H.R. 1145: National Water Research and Development Initiative Act

The  Committee  held  two  hearings  in  the  110th  Congress—on  May  14,  2008  and
July  23,  2008—on  water  supply  research  and  development.  At  the  hearings,  wit-
nesses’  discussed  the  need  for  better  coordination  of  federal  efforts  on  water,  in-
creased  funding  for  research  on  the  effects  of  climate  change  on  groundwater,  and
improved  consideration  of  efficient  water  use  in  energy  systems.  They  also  rec-
ommended that additional money be spent on public education programs.6

Despite  an  interagency  research  budget  of  approximately  $700  million,  an  in-
crease in the number of water shortages and emerging conflicts over water supplies
suggest  that  we  are  inadequately  prepared  to  address  the  Nation’s  water  manage-
ment issues. The 2004 report by the National Research Council entitled Confronting
the  Nation’s  Water  Problems:  The  Role  of  Federal  Research,7 advocates  for  a  clear
national  water  strategy  to  coordinate  the  20  plus  federal  agencies  responsible  for
conducting  and  funding  research  in  order  to  avoid  duplication  and  to  tackle  the
looming challenges of maintaining adequate water supplies.

Chairman Gordon introduced the National Water Research and Development Ini-
tiative  Act  on  September  23,  2008  following  the  Committee  hearings  (H.R.  6997)
and in response to the recommendations in the Academy’s 2004 report.

Chairman  Gordon  reintroduced  the  legislation  on  February  24,  2009.  H.R.  1145
coordinates federal research water efforts to ensure we have the best tools and infor-
mation to maintain adequate supplies of water for Americans in the coming decades.
The bill seeks to improve the Federal Government’s efforts in water research, devel-
opment,  demonstration,  education,  and  technology  transfer  activities  to  address
changes in water use, supply, and demand in the United States.

The bill codifies the Interagency Committee created in 2003, the Subcommittee on
Water  Availability  and  Quality  (SWAQ)  of  the  National  Science  and  Technology
Council’s Committee on Environment and Natural Resources. SWAQ was created to
identify science and technology needs to address the growing issues related to fresh-
water  supplies,  develop  a  coordinated  a  multi-year  plan  to  improve  research  on
water  supply  and  water  quality,  and  to  enhance  the  collection  and  availability  of
data  needed  to  ensure  an  adequate  water  supply  for  the  Nation.  H.R.  1145  incor-
porates  suggestions  in  the  National  Academies’  2004  report  that  are  intended  to
strengthen  the  Committee.  By  strengthening  the  SWAQ  and  providing  it  explicit
Congressional  authorization,  the  recommendations  of  the  2007  SWAQ  report8 will

receive  due  consideration  and  form  the  start  of  a  national  strategy  to  ensure  we
have a sustainable water supply.

Information and recommendations from witnesses obtained through the two hear-
ings in the 110th Congress and from other water experts were incorporated into the
bill introduced in the 111th Congress. Specific recommendations that have been in-
cluded in the current legislation include: an expanded list of research outcomes, spe-
cific  mechanisms  to  increase  public  input  and  involvement  in  shaping  and  evalu-
ating the Initiative, and provisions to facilitate communication and outreach oppor-
tunities with non-governmental organizations.

Additional Water Legislative Proposals

As  Congress  seeks  to  address  future  water  supply  challenges,  it  is  important  to
consider  how  the  National  Water  Research  and  Development  Initiative  Act  relates
to other federal policies and legislative proposals. Two bills that also address federal
water  policy  are:  H.R.  135,  the  21st  Century  Water  Commission  Act  and  S.  22,  the
Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009.

H.R. 135: 21st Century Water Commission Act of 2009

H.R.  135  was  introduced  by  Rep.  John  Linder  (R–GA).  This  legislation  would  es-
tablish a Commission to provide for water assessments to project future water sup-
ply  and  demand,  review  current  water  management  programs  at  all  levels  of  gov-
ernment,  and  develop  recommendations  for  a  comprehensive  water  strategy.  Mod-
eled after the 1968 National Water Commission Act, H.R. 135 creates a commission
consisting  of  non-federal  experts  appointed  by  the  President,  the  Speaker  of  the
House, and the Majority Leader of the Senate.

H.R.  135  requires  the  Commission  to  investigate  a  number  of  solutions  to  avert
future water shortages including: aqueducts and pipelines, aquifer recharge, repair-
ing  aging  infrastructure,  building  dams  and  reservoirs,  desalination,  the  capture
and storage of rainwater, recycled wastewater, conservation, and wetlands creation.
H.R.  135  complements  the  National  Water  Research  and  Development  Initiative
Act.  The  Commission’s  recommendations  would  be  carried  out  by  the  20-plus  agen-
cies  overseeing  federal  water  policy.  In  order  to  effectively  implement  these  rec-
ommendations, the Federal Government must have a coordinated structure in place.

S. 22: Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009

S.  22,  the  Omnibus  Public  Land  Management  Act  of  2009,  authorizes  many  pro-
grams and activities in the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agri-
culture related to public lands.

Title  IX,  Subtitle  F  of  this  legislation  directs  the  Secretary  of  Interior  to  conduct
a variety of activities related to water management on federal lands. The Secretary
is required to establish a climate change adaptation program to address water man-
agement  in  watersheds  containing  federally  authorized  reclamation  projects.  The
bill  also  directs  the  Secretary  of  Energy  to  conduct  an  assessment  of  potential  cli-
mate  change  impacts  on  hydropower  projects  under  the  authority  of  the  Federal
Power Marketing Administration. In addition, S. 22 directs the Secretary of Interior
to  establish  an  interagency  committee  on  water  and  climate  change  to  review  the
impacts of climate change on freshwater resources in the U.S., to develop strategies
to  improve  observations  and  expand  data  collection  needed  to  assess  climate  im-
pacts. The bill also provides an increased authorization for the U.S. Geological Serv-
ice  (USGS)  for  the  National  Streamflow  Information  Program  and  for  expanded
monitoring of groundwater resources.

H.R.  1145  ensures  coordination  of  the  research,  development  and  demonstration
activities of all federal agencies with expertise in water that will be required to de-
velop  the  required  assessments  and  the  adaptive  management  strategies  for  water
resources.  Participation  of  the  key  federal  agencies  with  expertise  and  authorities
over water resources in the interagency committees authorized under these two bills
will facilitate a transfer of coordinated research into coordinated water management
policy.

Chair  GORDON.  This  hearing  will  come  to  order,  and  good  morn-
ing,  and  welcome  to  today’s  hearing  on  the  21st  Century  Water
Planning.  I  thank  our  witnesses  for  accommodating  our  change  of
schedule. I thank my partner, Mr. Hall, for, on short notice, allow-
ing  us  to  change  the  schedule.  The  reason  being  Prime  Minister
Gordon  Browning  will  be  speaking  to  a  joint  session  later  today.
We  are  not  allowed,  and  we  should  not  be  meeting  during  that
time.  We  do  not  want  to  hold  witnesses  up  by  having  to  wait  for
that  uncertain  time  to  be  over  with,  and  it  does  mean  that  this  is
a little bit of sync, and so our Members may be coming and going.
I  thank  Ms.  Johnson  and  Mr.  Rohrabacher  for  being  here  this
morning. But the most important thing is we are going to get your
testimony  on  record,  and  that  will  help  us  move  forward  with  our
legislation.

Now, the most recent outlook issued by NOAA’s National Center
for the Environmental Prediction indicates that drought conditions
will  continue  to  plague  a  number  of  states  and  regions  throughout
the United States. California, the Central Plains, Texas, and Okla-
homa  and  the  southeastern  states  of  Georgia,  South  Carolina,  and
Florida  are  all  likely  to  experience  drought  conditions  in  the  com-
ing  months.  We  need  to  take  decisive  action  to  ensure  that  the
United  States  can  meet  the  water  challenges  of  2009,  and  beyond.
Last  Congress  this  committee  brought  attention  to  the  water
supply  challenges  by  holding  hearings  and  introducing  legislation
to  address  technological  and  strategic  deficiencies  at  the  federal
level.

Economic  recovery  legislation  recently  signed  by  President
Obama  included  significant  and  long  overdue  funds  for  states  and
localities to improve water infrastructure. Upgrading and repair of
the  water  delivery  and  treatment  systems  will  conserve  water,  im-
prove public health, and create jobs.

This  is  a  good  start,  but  we  must  do  more.  We  need  new  tools
to  evaluate  the  status  of  our  water  infrastructure  and  our  water
supplies.  We  need  effective  and  efficient  technologies  and  manage-
ment practices to improve water quality, and we must learn to use
water more efficiently.

We  need  a  national  water  policy,  and  research  and  development
must be an integral part of that policy. Research and development
are key ingredients to sound water resource management.

At the end of the last Congress I introduced legislation to estab-
lish  a  National  Water  Research  and  Development  Initiative,  and  I
reintroduced this legislation last week. H.R. 1145 incorporates rec-
ommendations  from  a  2004  report  by  the  National  Academies  of
Science  and  from  witnesses  who  appeared  before  our  committee  in
the  last  Congress.  This  legislation  will  ensure  that  the  20  federal
agencies, that is 20 federal agencies, that are conducting and fund-
ing  research  and  development  activities  on  water  will  coordinate
their  efforts  to  achieve  the  goal  of  managing  our  water  resources
for the benefit of our nation.

I  think  one  way  that  we  get  more  money  into  research  is  by
using the money that we have more efficiently and through that co-
ordination.

We  have  an  excellent  panel  of  witnesses  with  us  this  morning
who  will  share  their  views  on  what  we  need  to  do  as  a  nation  to

to  thank  you  all  for  being  with  us.  I  look  forward  to  your  sugges-

federal legislation and leadership.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIR BART GORDON

Good  morning  and  welcome  to  today’s  hearing  on  21st  Century  Water  Planning.
The  most  recent  outlook  issued  by  NOAA’s  National  Center  for  Environmental
Prediction  indicates  that  drought  conditions  will  continue  to  plague  a  number  of
states  and  regions  throughout  the  United  States.  California,  the  central  plains  of
Texas  and  Oklahoma,  and  the  southeastern  states  of  Georgia,  South  Carolina  and
Florida are all likely to experience drought conditions in the coming months.

Constraints  on  water  supplies  are  taking  a  toll  on  society,  our  economy,  and  the
environment. Water is too valuable a resource for us to manage in a crisis-by-crisis
fashion.

Recent  reports  of  California’s  water  shortages  carry  dire  predictions.  This  year’s
drought  is  projected  to  be  one  of  the  most  severe  in  California’s  recorded  history.
On February 20th, the Bureau of Reclamation announced further cut backs in water
supplied to municipalities and agriculture for the state.

Differing  forecast  scenarios  predict  a  substantial  impact  to  California’s  agricul-
tural  economy  and  indicating  that  some  areas  will  receive  no  water  this  year.  As
a result, agriculture losses could reach $3 billion in 2009 and water delivery reduc-
tions could result in a loss of 80,000 jobs.

We  need  to  take  decisive  action  to  ensure  that  the  United  States  can  meet  the

water challenges of 2009 and beyond.

Last  Congress,  this  committee  brought  attention  to  water  supply  challenges  by
holding  hearings  and  introducing  legislation  to  address  technological  and  strategic
deficiencies at the federal level.

Economic  recovery  legislation,  recently  signed  by  President  Obama,  included  sig-
nificant and long-overdue funds for states and localities to improve water infrastruc-
ture.  Upgrading  and  repair  of  water  delivery  and  treatment  systems  will  conserve
water, improve public health, and create jobs.

This  is  a  good  start,  but  we  must  do  more.  We  need  new  tools  to  evaluate  the
status of our water infrastructure and our water supplies. We need efficient and ef-
fective  technologies  and  management  practices  to  improve  water  quality.  And  we
must  learn  to  use  water  efficiently.  We  need  a  national  water  policy,  and  research
and development must be an integral part of that policy. Research and development
are key ingredients to sound water resource management.

At  the  end  of  the  last  Congress  I  introduced  legislation  to  establish  a  National
Water  Research  and  Development  Initiative.  I  reintroduced  this  legislation  last
week.

H.R.  1145  incorporates  recommendations  from  a  2004  report  by  the  National
Academy of Sciences and from witnesses who appeared before our committee in the
last Congress.

This  legislation  will  ensure  that  the  20  federal  agencies  that  are  conducting  and
funding  research  and  development  activities  on  water  will  coordinate  their  efforts
to  achieve  the  goal  of  managing  our  water  resources  for  the  benefit  of  our  nation.
We have an excellent panel of witnesses with us this morning who will share their
views on what we need to do as a nation to manage our water resources effectively
and  efficiently.  I  thank  you  all  for  being  with  us  here  today,  and  I  look  forward  to
your  suggestions  for  addressing  the  challenges  of  water  management  through  fed-
eral legislation and leadership.

Chair GORDON. I now recognize our distinguished Ranking Mem-

ber and my good friend, Mr. Hall.

Mr. HALL. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and you are correct. As a mat-
ter  of  fact,  this  is  the  fourth  hearing  we  are  holding  on  water
issues  in  the  last  year  and  a  half,  and  I  think  it  is  the  second  at
the Full Committee level.

There  is  not  one  district  I  am  aware  of  that  has  not  had  to  deal
with  a  water  problem  in  the  last  few  years,  whether  it  is  because
there  is  too  much  of  it  or  not  enough,  and  I  have  had  both.  You
know,  I  introduced  a  bill  several  years  ago,  and  you  helped  pass

it  through  to  address  the  drought  over  in  east  Texas  and  then
south  Tennessee.  And  as  you  could  guess,  at  Paris,  Texas,  an  old
man  said  after  I  had  introduced  it  and  told  him  about  it,  he  said,
‘‘Congressman, can you make it rain?’’ I said, ‘‘Yes, sir,’’ and about
two  and  a  half  years  later  we  had  a  five-inch  rain.  I  called  him,
got  him  out  of  bed  about  three  o’clock  in  the  morning,  and  I  said,
‘‘Mr. Roscoe, you know, I keep my word.’’ You have to remind them,
you know.

But  I  am  pleased  that  the  Committee’s  taking  such  an  interest
in  such  a  very  important  topic,  and  I  really  commend  you  for  con-
tinuing the work started some time ago. Three years ago we passed
and  the  President  signed  a  National  Integrated  Drought  Informa-
tion  System  Act  of  2006;  legislation  that  we  introduced  to  help  our
constituents  and  many  others  deal  with  the  devastating  effects  of
prolonged drought.

In  the  110th  Congress  and  again  at  the  beginning  of  this  Con-
gress  this  committee  moved  two  water  bills:  my  Produced  Water
Utilization  Act  and  Mr.  Matheson’s  Water  Use  Efficiency  and  Con-
servation  Research  Act,  and  the  Full  House  agreed  to  send  these
bills  to  the  Senate  on  a  voice  vote  last  July.  Energy  and  Environ-
ment Subcommittee has received testimony on draft legislative that
is  now  the  Chair’s  National  Water  Research  and  Development  Ini-
tiative Act, the bill we are here to discuss today.

The  amount  of  legislation,  including  this  very  important  legisla-
tion, that our committee has moved on water issues in the past few
years  demonstrates  our  awareness  of  the  need  to  address  the  crit-
ical  issues  our  Nation  faces  with  regard  to  water  quality,  supply,
and availability. I have heard it said that when one bottle of water
like this costs as much as a good bottle of beer, well, we got to get
pretty doggone serious about it.

The House is not alone in recognizing the problems we face with
water. Senate bill S. 22, the Omnibus Lands Bill, that includes the
Secure  Water  Act,  another  piece  of  legislation  that  attempts  to  ad-
dress shortcomings in our National Water Research Strategy.

Considering the Chair’s bill we are discussing here today, I hope
we  have  an  opportunity  to  collaborate  with  the  Senate  to  create  a
truly  comprehensive  and  rational  approach  to  water  research.  The
testimony we will hear today from our very qualified panelists will
help  us  better  understand  what  opportunities  exist  for  the  coordi-
nated federal research. It may also be wise to hear from the agen-
cies that are most involved in federal water research. With the new
Administration  in  place  I  think  we  would  benefit  from  learning
how they intend to approach water research and what kind of legis-
lation would help, best help them implement a coordinated federal
strategy. Comments from the Office of Science and Technology pol-
icy,  as  well  as  the  other  agencies,  might  help  in  our  authorization
process.

And  I  thank  you,  Mr.  Chair,  and  I  yield  back  the  balance  of  my

time.

the  last  few  years,  whether  it’s  because  there  is  too  much  of  it  or  not  enough  of  it.
I am pleased that the Committee is taking such an interest in such a vital and im-
portant topic.

Three  years  ago,  we  passed,  and  the  President  signed,  the  National  Integrated
Drought  Information  System  Act  of  2006,  legislation  I  introduced  to  help  my  con-

ment  Subcommittee  received  testimony  on  draft  legislation  that  is  now  the  Chair-
man’s National Water Research and Development Initiative Act, the bill we are here
to  discuss  today.  The  amount  of  legislation  our  committee  has  moved  on  water
issues in the last few years demonstrates our awareness of the need to address the
critical  issues  our  nation  faces  with  regards  to  water  quality,  supply  and  avail-
ability.

The House is not alone in recognizing the problems we face with water. The Sen-
ate  has  sent  S.  22,  an  omnibus  lands  bill  that  includes  the  SECURE  Water  Act,  a
piece of legislation that attempts to address shortcomings in our national water re-
search  strategy.  Considering  the  Chairman’s  bill  we  are  discussing  here  today,  I
hope  we  have  an  opportunity  to  collaborate  with  the  Senate  to  create  a  truly  com-
prehensive and rational approach to water research.

The  testimony  we  will  hear  today  from  our  very  qualified  panelists  will  help  us

Chair  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Hall,  and  you  are  absolutely
right.  We  do  need  to  get  information  from  those  sources  so  we  can
have the best bill possible.

Members may submit additional statements, and they will be in-

cluded in the record at this point.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing today, as this is an important
opportunity  to  plan  for  the  future  and  conserve  our  recourses  appropriately.  It’s  a
matter  of  common  sense  that  we  must  better  coordinate  research  and  technological
innovation to enhance water supplies and water quality on a national level.

We  know  from  the  droughts  over  the  past  years  and  the  rising  concern  sur-
rounding global warming that water resource problems are growing both in number
and  in  intensity.  Over  twenty  federal  agencies  carry-out  research  and  development
on  some  aspect  of  water  supply,  and  as  recent  reports  have  indicated,  we  must  do
more to better-coordinate these efforts and together work towards solutions.

In the past, the Committee has held hearings on this issue during which we have
heard  from  private  industry  about  steps  which  the  commercial  sector  is  taking  to
conserve  water  resources.  Fourtune  Brands,  an  Illinois-based  company,  has  taken
a  leading  role  to  promote  smart  technology  and  conservation  practices,  and  with
companies  like  Anheuser-Busch  have  formed  a  coalition  to  come  together  to  share
industry-wide  best  practices  to  reduce  the  use  of  water  and  conserve  a  valued  nat-
ural resource.

I  look  forward  to  our  testimony  today,  and  I  believe  the  proposed  legislation  is
an  important  step  in  planning  for  our  nation’s  future.  I  hope  that  during  this  Con-
gress we are able to pass H.R. 1145, the National Water Research and Development
Initiative  Act,  and  enact  some  of  the  reforms  that  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on
Climate Change report recommended. Thank you Mr. Chairman for your leadership
of this subcommittee; and I look forward to hearing from our witnesses.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Good morning, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member.
As  you  know,  the  State  of  Texas  has  suffered  a  terrible  drought  in  recent  years.

It has had large impacts on agriculture and on ranching.

Our  nation’s  water  supply  is  an  indispensable  commodity.  Access  to  water  has

never been more important for our citizens, plants and animals.

It is also important for so many other things, such as industry, research, even lei-

sure and sporting activities.

Scientists who serve on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC)
have  reported  that  water  supplies  stored  in  glaciers  and  snow  cover  will  decline  in
the course of the century.

The result will be a reduction in water availability in regions supplied by melting

water from major mountain ranges.

Melting polar ice caps could also cause the rise in sea levels; the impact on coastal

states like Texas and Florida will be tremendous.

Never  before  has  it  been  more  important  to  establish  a  national  plan  on  water

The Science Committee has held hearings in 2008—in May and in July—on water

research and conservation.

supply and development.

Witnesses recommended better coordination of federal efforts on water.
They  also  recommended  increased  funding  for  research  on  the  effects  of  climate
change on groundwater, and improved consideration of efficient water use in energy
systems.

In addition, they also recommended that additional money be spent on public edu-

cation programs.

Mr. Chairman, I will be interested to hear stakeholder feedback on H.R. 1145, the

National Water Research and Development Initiative Act.

The  bill  would  establish  an  Interagency  Committee  to  coordinate  water  research,
development, data collection, education and tech transfer. The Office of Science and
Technology Policy will chair this committee.

Today’s panel of witnesses brings a variety of perspectives.
The breadth of experience will provide Committee Members with the kind of feed-

back needed to devise and refine policy.

For  years,  I  have  been  involved  in  this  issue  as  a  Member  of  the  Transportation

Committee’s Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment.

Because I chair that subcommittee, I am in a position to help guide and facilitate

this bill through the legislative process.

Chairman  Gordon,  I  thank  you  for  your  interest  in  this  issue  and  look  forward

to working with you on it, going forward.

Thank you, and I yield back the remainder of my time.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Carnahan follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSS CARNAHAN

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  hosting  this  important  hearing  on  21st  century
water  planning.  Population  growth,  variation  in  our  climate  and  degradation  of
water  quality  all  complicate  current  water  supply  management  and  coordination  in
our nation.

As  we  see  increasing  competition  for  a  limited  water  supply,  the  importance  of
a coordinated federal approach can provide an effective framework to address these
water  resource  challenges.  Through  efficient  communication,  duplicative  and  con-
flicting  actions  by  different  agencies  can  be  reduced,  as  well  as  ensuring  the  collec-
tion of comprehensive data to make water management decisions.

Additionally, at the federal level, interagency action and cooperation are essential
for  looking  at  comprehensive  water  concerns  rather  than  agencies  just  focusing  on
their  core  missions.  States  must  think  of  the  larger  watershed  rather  than  just  the
part  of  the  watershed  that  touches  each  individual  state,  because  the  management
of a watershed in one state has an effect on the larger watershed.

I am encouraged by the proposed legislation before us today. This is an important
step  at  finally  encouraging  cooperation  among  federal  agencies  with  respect  to
water-related  research  and  avoiding  duplication  of  efforts  to  ensure  optimal  use  of
resources and expertise.

To  the  witnesses  before  us  today,  I  want  to  thank  you  for  taking  the  time  out  of
your busy schedules to appear before us. I look forward to hearing your testimonies
and of ways in which we might improve our efforts on these matters.

I believe that it is absolutely critical that we address the growing shortage of our
nation’s water supply and work to establish progressive and cost-effective water re-
source management policies.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  more  from  our  witnesses  on  Chairman  Gordon’s  pro-
posed legislation, the National Water Research and Development Initiative Act, H.R.
1145.

I yield back.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Smith follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE ADRIAN SMITH

As our country tackles issues related to water consumption and conservation prac-
tices, research and development will continue to play an important role in decisions
made  at  all  levels  of  government.  Increasing  demands  on  water  supplies  have  re-
sulted in conflicts throughout the Nation. Droughts, coupled with new laws and reg-
ulations to protect endangered species, as well as reduce or eliminate pollution, con-
tinue to add even more stress to our developed water and power supplies.

Representing  a  predominantly  rural,  agricultural-based  district  in  which  surface
water  and  groundwater  issues  are  at  the  forefront  of  many  decisions  and  debates,
my  principal  goals  are  to  create  policies  which  will  strengthen  rural  America  and
provide  long-term  stability  for  our  nation’s  producers.  Ensuring  the  sustainability
of our country’s water supply through increased coordination, research, and develop-
ment  is  of  utmost  importance  to  the  economic  and  social  well-being  of  our  nation
and its citizens.

Enhanced  coordination  at  not  only  the  federal  level,  but  also  State  and  local  lev-
els, is necessary to ensure a sustainable future for one of our most essential natural
resources.

Chairman  Gordon’s  legislation,  H.R.  1145,  the  National  Water  Research  and  De-
velopment Initiative Act of 2009, takes a positive step in seeking to improve the Fed-
eral  Government’s  efforts  in  water  research,  development,  and  technology  transfer.
By  adequately  studying  and  addressing  water  use,  as  well  as  supply  and  demand
issues, we can ensure our country’s access to this important resource.

I  appreciate  the  Committee  holding  this  hearing  to  explore  the  opportunities  for
the Federal Government to better coordinate and support research and technological
innovation.  I  look  forward  to  discussing  and  exploring  this  important  issue  further
through the Science and Technology Committee.

Chair  GORDON.  Our  first  panel  and  our  only  panel  here  today,  I
will  now  introduce  our  witnesses.  First,  Dr.  Henry  Vaux  is  Pro-
fessor  Emeritus  at  the  University  of  California,  Berkley,  Dr.  Peter
Gleick  is  President  of  the  Pacific  Institute  for  Studies  in  Develop-
ment,  Environment,  and  Security,  and  Dr.  Mark  Modzelewski  is
the Co-founder of the Water Innovations Alliance. And now for the
ladies’ side of the table. Ms. Nancy Stoner is the Coordinator of the
Water Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, and Ms.
Christine  Furstoss  is  the  General  Manager  of  Technology  at  the
General Electric Water and Process Technologies.

As  I  pointed  out  earlier,  this  was  not  a  planned  effort  to  seg-
regate  you,  and  we  are  glad  you  are  here.  As  you  know,  we  try  to
limit  our  witnesses’  oral  statement  to  about  five  minutes,  and  all
your  record—written  statement  will  be  a  part  of  the  testimony.
And  when  you  complete  your  testimony,  we  will  begin  the  ques-
tions.  So  each  Member  will  have  five  minutes  to  question  the
panel.

At  the  outset  I  should  state  that  I  was  the  chair  of  the  two  Na-
tional  Academy  of  Science  committees  whose  reports  are  referred
to in Section 2 of the bill, and although I do not formally speak for
the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  or  the  National  Research  Coun-
cil, my testimony is based upon the analysis and recommendations
contained in those reports.

We  face  many  difficult  challenges  in  this  first  decade  or  at  the
end  of  this  first  decade  of  the  21st  century,  but  the  challenge  of
husbanding  and  managing  our  water  resources  is  a  longer-term
challenge  than  many  of  the  others  and  will  remain  with  us
throughout the remainder of the century.

The  ease  or  difficulty  with  which  we  adapt  to  this  growing  and
intensifying  water  scarcity  will  depend  critically  upon  our  willing-
ness  to  invest  in  additional  science.  The  Federal  Water  Research
Portfolio today suffers from a variety of ills. Too heavy an emphasis
on  short-term  research  and  operationally-oriented  research,  it  is  a
portfolio that is out of balance with current water realities, and the
research  across  the  board  suffers  from  the  absence  of  any  agreed-
upon agenda and set of priorities for water research.

The  major  explanation  for  the  state  of  our  water  research  is  as
you  said,  Mr.  Chair,  not  so  much  a  lack  of  money  as  a  lack  of  co-
ordination  and  a  lack  of  communication.  The  proposed  legislation
would,  if  enacted  in  its  present  form,  create  a  strong  and  appro-
priate basis for addressing the problems that currently characterize
our national water research efforts.

I have detailed the significant strengths of that legislation in my
written  testimony.  Let  me  turn  in  the  time  that  remains  to  four
suggestions  for  ways  in  which  the  Act  might  be  further  strength-
ened.

First  of  all,  a  funding  suggestion.  The  provision  or  authorization
of additional funds both for research and to defray the costs of im-
plementing the Act, and so many agencies I think it is more likely
that  we  would  get  a  productive  response  to  the  Act  if  there  were
money involved and if that money, the availability of it, was made
contingent upon progress in meeting the goals and objectives of the
Act. So additional funding is one suggestion.

Additional  research  outcome,  Subsection  2C2  is  reasonably  com-
prehensive,  but  a  ninth  category  is  needed,  focusing  on  the  social
sciences, research in the social sciences needed to facilitate the de-
velopment  of  innovative  water  management  institutions.  And  a
tenth  category  is  also  needed.  That  category  focused  on  under-
standing  the  hydrologic  and  water  use  implications  of  climate
change.

Let me also urge that you add a subsection emphasizing modern
research  themes  in  an  effort  to  encourage  the  agencies  to  depart

14

from  the  reductionist  approach  to  research  that  has  characterized
the  last  century.  Those  modern  research  themes  require  an  inner-
disciplinary  approach  to  research,  require  a  research  framework,
which  is  cast  in  a  broad-systems  context,  requires  the  specific  ac-
knowledgement  and  characterization  of  the  uncertainty  associated
with the research results, and also acknowledges the importance of
being adaptive.

A  final  suggestion  for  improvement  in  the  legislation  is  based
upon the need to involve academic researchers in the efforts called
for  in  the  bill,  because  academic  researchers  are  well  equipped  to
undertake  the  longer-term  research.  And  the  most  straightforward
way  in  which  this  could  be  done  would  be  by  including  directly  a
role  for  the  Water  Resources  Research  Institutes,  which  reach  out
to  all  institutions  of  higher  education,  colleges  and  universities  in
all  of  the  states  and  trust  territories.  The  Institutes  were  most  re-
cently authorized, reauthorized in Public Law 109–471.

I urge also that you consider making one or more institute direc-
tors a member of the interagency committee, either ex officio or as
regular  members.  This  addition  would  be  especially  important
since  it  takes  advantage  of  established  relationships  between  the
Federal  Government  and  the  academic  water  resources,  research
community.

Mr.  Chair,  thank  you  again  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before

your committee.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Vaux follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HENRY VAUX, JR.

Mr.  Chairman,  my  name  is  Henry  Vaux,  Jr.  and  I  am  Professor  Emeritus  of  Re-
source Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. I am also Associate Vice
President, Emeritus of the University of California System. I wish to thank you for
the  opportunity  to  appear  before  your  committee  this  morning  at  this  hearing  on
the proposed National Water Research and Development Initiative Act.

At the outset, I should state that I was the Chair of the National Academy Com-
mittees  which  created  two  of  the  reports  referred  to  in  Section  2  of  the  proposed
Act.  These  reports  were  entitled:  Envisioning  the  Agenda  for  Water  Resources  Re-
search  in  the  21st  Century  and  Confronting  the  Nation’s  Water  Problems:  The  Role
of  Research.  Although  I  do  not  formally  speak  for  the  National  Research  Council,
most  of  my  testimony  is  based  on  those  analyses  and  on  the  recommendations  con-
tained in the second of these reports (hereinafter identified as ‘‘NRC Committee Re-
port’’).

The Need for New Water Science

Although our nation faces many difficult challenges in this first decade of the 21st
century,  the  challenge  of  husbanding  and  managing  our  water  resources  is  a  long-
term challenge that will be with us over the remainder of this century. Water scar-
city will continue to intensify. Our water supplies are basically finite although their
occurrence varies over time. Long-term observations of precipitation and run-off sug-
gest  that  hardly  any  year  is  an  average  year.  The  extremes  of  flood  and  drought
recur  periodically  and  there  is  evidence  to  suggest  that  these  extremes  will  become
more frequent. There is also evidence to suggest that for many regions of the United
States, the advent of climate change may entail some general decline and changing
in the timing of precipitation and run-off. Continuing deterioration of water quality
will  also  mean  less  water  available  for  many  important  and  valuable  uses.  Revers-
ing the trends of water quality declines and enhancing the aggregate level of water
quality  in  the  U.S.  will  be  necessary  to  avoid  further  erosion  in  the  quantities  of
available supply. The general water supply picture that emerges for the future sug-
gests water supplies will be less available then they were in the past. There is less
likelihood that they would remain stable and virtually no possibility that they could
be made to grow.

Arrayed against such declining (or static) future levels of water supply are a num-
ber  of  factors  which  suggest  that  the  demand  for  water  may  grow.  These  include:

15

• Population  Growth—Some  estimates  suggest  that  U.S.  population  may
grow by as much as 50 percent between now and 2050. Taken alone, a popu-
lation  increase  of  such  magnitude  will  cause  significant  increases  in  the  de-
mand for water.

• Expansion  of  Irrigated  Agriculture—The  need  to  feed  an  increased  do-
mestic  population  as  well  as  a  global  population  that  is  projected  to  be  three
billion  larger  by  the  end  of  the  century  will  be  translated  into  growing  de-
mands  for  agricultural  water  everywhere.  Though  rain  fed  agriculture  will
play  a  very  important  role,  there  will  be  pressure  to  expand  irrigated  agri-
culture  because  it  is  more  productive.  In  the  U.S.,  for  example,  about  one-
third of the farm land is irrigated and that one-third accounts for 45 percent
of the total production.

• Protecting  the  Environment—Past  water  development  practices  have  en-
tailed the transfer of water from environmental uses to municipal, industrial
and  agricultural  uses.  It  is  unlikely  that  this  practice  can  continue  for  long
without  incur  major  and  highly  costly  damages  in  the  form  of  lost  environ-
mental services and reduced environmental amenities. There is some evidence
to  suggest  that  we  may  have  to  allocate  more  water  to  environmental  pur-
poses—not  less—if  we  are  to  protect  environmental  services  and  amenities.
The  trends  of  growing  demands  and  static  or  declining  supplies  of  water  mean
that  water  scarcity  will  intensify  over  the  coming  decades.  As  a  consequence,  com-
petition  of  limited  supplies  of  water  will  intensify  and  conflicts  over  the  allocation
of  available  supplies  will  also  increase.  Professor  William  Jury  and  I  have  recently
completed  work  concluding  that  the  ease  or  difficulty  with  which  we  adapt  to  this
intensifying  water  scarcity  will  depend  critically  upon  our  willingness  to  invest  in
additional science. Properly focused, such an investment will considerably help iden-
tify ways to ameliorate water scarcity and reduce conflict over water allocation and
use.

The State of Federally Funded Water Research

Today,  the  annual  federal  investment  in  water  resources  research  is  approxi-
mately  $700  million  in  constant  2000  dollars.  This  figure  is  the  same  in  real  terms
as  the  annual  federal  investment  in  water  research  in  FY  1975.  Thus,  we  face  an
intensifying  water  scarcity  in  circumstances  in  which  there  has  been  little  change
in the magnitude of federal water research funding over the past 35 years. In other
words,  support  for  water  science  has  not  kept  pace  with  population  growth,  growth
in  gross  domestic  product,  or  growth  in  federal  budget  outlays  for  at  least  the  last
four  decades.  This  has  occurred  despite  the  fact  that  the  productivity  and  value  of
water  has  increased  even  while  the  challenges  of  managing  limited  waters  effec-
tively and efficiently have grown.

The  topical  balance  of  the  federal  water  research  portfolio  has  changed  signifi-
cantly  since  the  period  1965–1975  in  ways  that  make  it  inconsistent  with  today’s
water  research  priorities.  Specifically,  research  on  water  demand,  water  law  and
other institutional topics and research on water supply augmentation and conserva-
tion currently receive a smaller proportion of total water research funding then they
did 30 years ago. The NRC Committee concluded that these topics currently appear
to  be  underfunded.  In  addition,  the  current  water  portfolio  is  heavily  weighted  to-
ward  short-term  research.  Longer-term  research,  necessary  to  help  address  the
water problems of the future and to help support the applied research that will need
to  be  done  a  decade  hence,  is  significantly  under-emphasized  in  agency  water  re-
search budgets. For all of these reasons the NRC Committee concluded that we are
obtaining less for the annual $700 million in federal water research than we should.
The major explanation for this state of water research is not necessarily that the
funding is inadequate. The explanation lies more importantly with the fact that fed-
eral research is largely uncoordinated. This means that the President and Congress
lack information about:

• The size and shape of the entire federal water research portfolio;
• Measures  of  magnitude  and  effectiveness  of  individual  elements  in

• Any sense of national priorities of water research;
• Guidance  about  what  might  be  an  appropriate  balance  among  re-

the portfolio;

search elements.

The proposed legislation from the National Water Research and Development Ini-
tiative  would,  if  enacted  in  its  present  form,  create  a  strong  and  appropriate  basis

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:01 Aug 30, 2009 Jkt 047553 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\FULL09\030409\47553 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

16

for addressing the problems that currently characterize the Nation’s water research
efforts. It accurately captures a number of important recommendations found in the
report of the NRC Committee. Thus, for example, the legislation would:

• Require the establishment of a unified national water research agen-

da;

• Require  coordination  of  water  federal  research,  development,  data

collection, and information dissemination activities;

• Encourage  cooperation  among  federal  agencies  engaged  in  water  re-

search and technology development;

• Require  technology  transfer,  communication  and  information  ex-
change  with  State  and  local  governments,  industry  and  other  stake-
holders;

• Establishes an appropriate institutional arrangement, including a re-
quirement  for  budget  coordination  in  the  Executive  branch,  for  ac-
complishing these four tasks.

A  further  strength  of  the  proposed  legislation,  as  written,  lies  with  the  emphasis
on  the  collection,  management  and  exchange  of  data  on  water  resources.  The  last
two  decades  have  been  characterized  significant  disinvestment  in  the  acquisition  of
water  and  water  related  data.  We  have  fewer  stream  gauges  now  than  we  did  20
years ago; our monitoring and measuring of water quality is less adequate now than
it  was  20  years  ago  even  though  the  threats  to  water  quality  have  grown;  and  we
are  unable  to  measure  water  use  adequately  over  time.  There  has  been  a  notable
failure to take full advantage of modern remote sensing technology to acquire water
resources  data.  In  addition,  there  has  been  little  coordination  or  standardization  of
existing  data  gathering  efforts  with  the  result  that  we  are  getting  less  from  those
efforts than we could be getting. Without more coordination and investment in gath-
ering,  managing,  and  interpreting  water  resource  data,  both  management  efforts
and needed research will be less effective than they might be.

Recommendations for Improvement

While  the  legislation  as  written  has  significant  strengths,  there  are  a  number  of

ways in which it might be further strengthened:

• Additional  Funding:  First,  there  are  a  large  number  of  federal  agencies
that  undertake  water  resources  research.  Those  agencies  are  more  likely  to
behave  productively  in  pursuing  the  objectives  of  the  legislation  if  additional
research  funding  were  to  be  authorized  and  the  availability  of  that  funding
made contingent upon the various requirements contained in the Act.
The  concern  here  arises  because  the  Interagency  Committee  authorized  by
the Act is not dissimilar from the Water Resources Council authorized by the
Water  Resources  Planning  Act  of  1965.  As  the  record  shows,  the  Water  Re-
sources  Council  was  largely  ineffective  as  the  member  agencies  focused  on
protecting their own turf and on little else.
The  NRC  Committee  suggested  that  existing  levels  of  federal  investment  in
research  might  be  adequate  if  the  research  portfolio  were  altered  to  place
more  emphasis  on  topics  such  as  conservation,  water  supply  augmentation
and  the  development  of  institutions  for  managing  water  resources.  Alter-
natively,  the  Committee  suggested  that  additional  funding  on  the  order  of
$70  million  might  be  made  available  for  the  purposes  of  rebalancing  the  re-
search  portfolio.  Those  funds  could  also  defray  the  operational  costs  of  the
Interagency Committee and provide incentives for productive interaction and
coordination among the agencies that conduct water resources research.

• Additional  Research  Outcomes:  The  list  of  Water  Research  Outcomes  in
Subsection  2(c)(2)  is  reasonably  comprehensive.  However,  a  ninth  category
needs to be added that emphasizes the need for research on the development
of  water  management  institutions.  This  is  critically  important  research  area
that has the potential to develop institutions which will facilitate the manage-
ment  of  scarce  water  resources  more  efficiently  and  effectively  in  the  future.
This  area  has  been  identified  as  underfunded.  Indeed,  in  recent  years  the
level  of  federal  funding  for  the  social  sciences  needed  to  aid  in  the  develop-
ment of improved water institutions has not been significantly different from
zero.  The  legislation  would  be  considerably  strengthened  by  acknowledging
the  importance  of  social  science  and  institutional  research.  A  tenth  category

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:01 Aug 30, 2009 Jkt 047553 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\FULL09\030409\47553 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

17

focused  on  understanding  the  hydrologic  and  water  use  implications  of  cli-
mate change should also be added.

• Emphasize Modern Research Themes: Just as it is important that all sig-
nificant  outcomes  are  included,  it  will  also  be  important  to  acknowledge  in
the  body  of  the  bill,  the  importance  of  new  modes  of  research.  The  report  of
the NRC Committee on the role of research emphasized that future water re-
search  should  be  carried  out  of  necessity  in  modes  different  from  the  tradi-
tional  reductionist  mode  which  typifies  most  research  over  the  last  century.
The  Committee  identified  four  modern  research  themes:  1)  an  interdiscipli-
nary approach; 2) a broad systems perspective in the conduct of the research;
3)  acknowledging  and  characterizing  uncertainty;  and  4)  the  importance  of
being adaptive. These should be acknowledged in the bill.

• Interdisciplinary:  The  need  for  interdisciplinary  research  has  been  widely
recognized in the scientific literature. Indeed, it appears unlikely that an ade-
quate  understanding  of  the  environmental  importance  of  water  can  be  devel-
oped in the absence of involvement of scientists from a number of disciplines.
Thus,  for  example,  research  on  aquatic  ecosystems  must  be  based  on  ecologi-
cal and biological principles as well as the science of hydrology and an under-
standing of how human use transforms the quantity and quality of water.

• Broad  Systems  Context:  A  systems  approach  requires  not  only  that  the
variables which contribute to a problem be identified and understood and that
the linkages between these variables must be understood as well. Indeed, un-
derstanding the linkages between causal variables are now thought to be just
as important as understanding the variables themselves.

• Uncertainty: Scientific information and the results of scientific investigation
can  rarely  be  expressed  with  complete  certainty.  Virtually  every  data  point
and virtually every finding is characterized by some degree of uncertainty. In
the  future,  it  will  be  incumbent  upon  researchers  to  acknowledge  the  exist-
ence  of  uncertainty  and,  where  possible,  characterize  the  extent  of  it  quan-
titatively.

• Adaptation:  Adaptation  can  be  conceived  as  a  combination  of  flexibility  in
solving  problems  and  a  willingness  to  shift  norms  and  standards  in  response
to  novel  circumstances  and  situations.  Adaptation  will  be  critical  for  both
water researchers and managers in the coming decades as we confront water
problems for which there has been no historical experience.

The  proposed  legislation  could  be  strengthened  by  acknowledging  the  importance
of  these  four  themes  in  the  framing  and  conduct  of  research.  Their  use  cannot  be
mandated  but  agencies  will  need  every  encouragement  to  abandon  traditional  ap-
proaches  to  research  and  emphasize  more  modern  approaches  that  are  likely  to  be
more acceptable.

Involve the Academic Community

A  final  suggestion  for  improvement  in  the  legislation  is  based  upon  the  need  to
involve academic researchers in the efforts called for in the bill. The academic com-
munity  has  played  a  large  role  in  water  research  and  will  continue  to  do  so  in  the
future.  Moreover,  there  is  need  to  expand  the  proportion  of  long-term  and  investi-
gator-initiated research in the national portfolio. The academic community is better
situated  to  perform  longer-term  research  since  it  is  not  tied  to  the  operational  mis-
sions  of  the  agencies  which  tend  to  result  in  research  agendas  focused  on  more  im-
mediate  short-term  problems.  There  are  several  ways  in  which  the  academic  com-
munity  might  be  involved.  Perhaps  the  most  straightforward  way  would  be  by  in-
cluding  the  broad  array  of  water  resource  research  activities  at  the  Nation’s  land
grant  Universities  directly  by  identifying  a  role  for  the  Water  Resources  Research
Institutes,  most  recently  reauthorized  in  the  Water  Resources  Research  Act  Amend-
ments of 2006 (P.L. 109–471). One or more Water Institute Director representatives
should be authorized to serve on the Interagency Committee created in Section 2(b)
either ex officio or as regular members. This addition would be especially important
since  it  takes  advantage  of  established  relationships  between  the  Federal  Govern-
ment and the academic water research community. In this way all of the major ac-
tors  in  the  water  research  community  would  be  directly  involved  in  the  activities
of  the  Water  Research  and  Development  Initiative  Activities  that  would  be  author-
ized by this legislation.

In  summary,  then,  I  believe  the  proposed  legislation  to  be  a  significant  step  for-
ward.  It  would  address  the  need  for  new  and  productive  water  research.  It  would
provide  a  mechanism  for  establishing  priorities  and  ensuring  the  results  and  data

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:01 Aug 30, 2009 Jkt 047553 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\FULL09\030409\47553 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

18

are  fully  shared  and  disseminated.  The  legislation  could  be  strengthened  by:  1)  au-
thorizing  new  funding  to  support  the  coordination  and  agenda  setting  activities  as
well  as  new  research;  2)  including  the  social  sciences  and  the  development  of  insti-
tutions as well as climate change in the research outcomes; 3) specifically acknowl-
edging  four  modern  water  research  themes  in  the  legislation;  and  4)  including  aca-
demic  researchers  and  the  academic  community  in  the  research  and  development
initiative.

Mr. Chairman, I wish to thank you again for the opportunity to appear this morn-
ing and to state my views on National Water Research and Development legislation.

Chair  GORDON.  Thank  you  for  those  very  good  ideas.  I  am  glad

you read the bill.

And Dr. Peter Gleick, you are now recognized.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  PETER  H.  GLEICK,  CO-FOUNDER  AND
PRESIDENT,  THE  PACIFIC  INSTITUTE  FOR  STUDIES  IN  DE-
VELOPMENT,  ENVIRONMENT,  AND  SECURITY,  OAKLAND,
CALIFORNIA
Dr. GLEICK. Mr. Chair, Members of the Committee, thank you for
having  me  testify  today.  I  hope  at  least  those  of  us  at  the  table
have read the bill. I would like to thank the Committee for inviting
me  to  offer  comments  on  the  bill.  I  also  would  like  to  note  at  the
outset  I  spent  some  of  my  early  time  doing  research  at  the
Oakridge  National  Laboratory.  I  remember  my  time  in  Tennessee
very fondly.

The water crisis around the Nation is growing. The need for bet-
ter  and  more-coordinated  responses  is  urgent,  and  I  think  we  all
understand  that.  We  have  long  known  that  more  coordination
among federal agencies is going to be critical for dealing with water
issues, but that coordination remains an elusive goal.

And  new  challenges  face  us.  Climate  change,  new  pollutants  de-
caying infrastructure around the Nation. My written testimony ad-
dresses these issues. I am not going to repeat it here this morning.
What I would like to do is highlight a few points.

In  particular,  let  me  start  by  saying  that  many  of  our  water
problems  are  local  and  have  to  be  addressed  at  the  local  issue,  at
the  local  level.  But  we  do  have  a  responsibility  to  develop  appro-
priate  national  policies  as  well,  and  at  the  moment  these  respon-
sibilities  as  you  note  are  split  among  at  least  25  separate  federal
agencies, and they don’t speak well to each other, they don’t speak
often to each other, and the goal of this bill to improve that coordi-
nation,  to  develop  a  consistent  research  agenda,  to  use  our  limited
resources efficiently is an excellent one.

As  the  bill  notes,  some  effort  in  this  area  has  been  made  by  the
SWAQ  Committee,  the  Subcommittee  on  Water  Availability  and
Quality under OSTP. I think the research results, the research rec-
ommendations  produced  by  SWAQ  in  September,  2007,  are  an  ex-
cellent step forward in setting a national agenda, and I think they
have  been  complemented  by  reports  from  the  National  Research
Council that Dr. Vaux talked about and from the General Account-
ability  Office.  I  think  those  altogether  provide  a  superb  starting
point for moving water research forward.

It is not clear to me that a new subcommittee or new interagency
committee  is  necessary  if  the  idea  is  to  strengthen  SWAQ,  and  I
think  that  might  be  an  appropriate  way  to  move  forward.  But
whatever approach is taken, I would urge that this committee, this
organizing group have a separate research budget of its own, either
to give out in a competitive grants situation or to manage itself.

Second, I think this group should include outside experts from ei-
ther  other  federal  agencies  or  from  non-federal  agencies  as  well,
something  that  SWAQ  has  not  done  at  the  moment.  The  National
Research Council previously concluded in its 2004, report that such
outside advice would be enormously valuable.

Third,  the  bill  calls  for  an  interagency  committee  to  ‘‘establish
the  priorities  for  federal  water  research.’’  I  actually  believe  those
priorities are fairly well established already from SWAQ’s previous
work,  from  the  NRC,  from  the  Government  Accountability  Office.
We  know  what  needs  to  be  done.  What  we  need  is  the  funding  to
go ahead and do it. And so I don’t think we necessarily need to call
for  a  new  assessment.  I  think  we  should  instead  focus  on  the  sec-
tions  of  this  bill,  C2C  in  particular,  that  calls  for,  ‘‘a  strategy  and
timeline to achieve the desired outcomes.’’

Fourth, the explicit outcomes in the bill I would argue are unnec-
essary if we adopt the recommendations of SWAQ and the National
Research Council. Conversely, if we are going to include specific re-
search  outcomes  in  this  bill,  I  would  offer  four  explicit  rec-
ommendations for additions.

The  first  is  that  the  call  for  a  national  water  census  is  a  great
idea, but it needs to include a census of water use nationwide, not
just the water resources of the Nation, but actually how we use our
water resources. That was recommended by SWAQ. It didn’t make
it into this bill, and I think it would be easy to add.

Second,  the  national  census  is  urgently  needed,  but  I  would  rec-
ommend  that  it  explicitly  be  called  for  as  a  census,  that  is  every
10  years  or  so,  and  an  explicit  budget  be  provided  to  do  the  na-
tional census.

Third, missing from the water research outcomes but included in
every  recent  call  for  research  around  the  Nation  is  an  assessment

20

of  the  implications  of  climate  change  on  the  Nation’s  water  re-
sources. And I think it would be easy to add that outcome as well.
Fourth,  Section  D4  calls  for  development  of  innovative  tech-
nologies  and  tools  to  enhance  water  use  efficiency.  That  is  a  great
idea but it should also call for an expansion of existing tools in the
water efficiency area.

Let me close by simply saying we also need, in addition to better
coordination  on  research,  we  need  some  things  not  addressed  by
this  legislation,  such  as  a  National  Water  Commission.  H.R.  135
has  been  submitted  at  various  times  in  the  House.  It  has  passed
the  House.  I  urge  a  National  Water  Commission  be  resubmitted
and  redeveloped  as  a  way  to  move  forward  on  things  not  going  to
be covered by the current legislation.

Thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PETER H. GLEICK1

Mr. Chairman, Representatives: I would like to thank the Committee for inviting
me  to  offer  comments  on  the  critical  issue  of  21st  century  water  planning  in  the
United States. The water crisis around the Nation is growing and the need for bet-
ter  and  more  coordinated  responses  is  urgent.  We  have  long  known  that  we  need
coordinated  federal  planning  for  water;  but  such  coordination  remains  an  elusive
goal. And new water challenges such as climate change, new pollutants, and decay-
ing infrastructure face the Nation.

My written testimony will address three issues:

1. The  kinds  of  water  challenges  we  face  the  national  level  and  the  kinds  of

responses we need,

2. Some specific thoughts about the proposed legislation sponsored by Congress-
man Gordon of Tennessee (H.R. 1145, entitled the ‘‘National Water Research
and Development Initiative Act of 2009.’’), and

3. The need for additional federal policies and legislation not directly addressed

by this legislation.

Global and National Water Challenges

Globally, the realization is growing that the failure to meet basic human and envi-
ronmental needs for water is the greatest development disaster of the 20th century.
Millions  of  people,  mostly  young  children,  still  die  annually—and  unnecessarily—
from preventable water-related diseases. Climate change is increasingly threatening
water  systems  and  water  resources  everywhere.  Controversy  is  developing  over  the
proper  role  of  expensive  dams  and  infrastructure,  private  corporations,  and  local
communities  in  managing  water.  And  international  and  sub-national  threats  to  se-
curity as a result of water quality and quantity disputes have ramifications for U.S.
military and diplomatic policy.

Here  at  home,  freshwater  challenges  in  the  United  States  are  also  growing  rap-
idly. These challenges include growing scarcity, disputes over allocations and use of
water,  unresolved  problems  of  contamination  from  known  sources  and  new  pollut-
ants,  a  clear  and  present  danger  associated  with  the  impacts  of  climate  change,  a
decaying infrastructure and data collection system, and threats to our own security
at the national and international level associated with these problems in other coun-
tries.

Municipalities are faced with billions of dollars of infrastructure needs and grow-
ing  disputes  over  the  role  of  public  and  private  water  management.  Arguments
among western states over allocations of shared rivers remain unresolved, and simi-
lar  arguments  have  now  appeared  in  the  southeastern  U.S.  and  other  regions  pre-
viously  thought  to  have  adequate  water  resources.  Tensions  between  cities  and
farmers over water rights are rising. The U.S. and Mexico have unresolved disagree-
ments over the Colorado and Rio Grande/Rio Bravo rivers, and our Canadian neigh-
bors  remain  worried  about  how  best  to  jointly  manage  the  shared  Great  Lakes.

Communities are facing new challenges in meeting water-quality standards and en-
suring that safe drinking water is available for all.

Addressing our National Water Problems

Many  of  our  water  problems  are  local,  and  must  be  resolved  at  the  local  and  re-
gional level. But we have a responsibility to develop and implement appropriate na-
tional  policies  as  well.  These  responsibilities  are  not  being  adequately  fulfilled  by
the  diverse  federal  agencies  responsible  for  them.  Part  of  the  problem  is  confusion
over authority. Part of the problem is the failure of the Executive Branch in recent
years  to  request  sufficient  funds  to  protect  and  manage  our  water  resources,  and
of the legislative branch to appropriate and allocate those funds. Part of the problem
is old water legislation that has not been updated to account for the realities of the
21st  century  and  for  recent  advances  in  our  scientific  and  technical  understanding
of both water problems and solutions.

Responsibility  for  water  is  spread  out  over  many  federal  agencies  and  depart-
ments,  operating  with  little  overall  coordination.  In  order  to  address  this  issue,  the
President’s  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy  (OSTP),  through  the  National
Science  and  Technology  Council’s  Committee  on  Environment  and  Natural  Re-
sources,  reconstituted  in  2003  a  Subcommittee  on  Water  Availability  and  Quality
(SWAQ). Members of that subcommittee come from the departments of Interior, Ag-
ricultural,  Defense,  State,  Energy,  Health  and  Human  Services,  EPA,  Commerce,
NASA,  the  National  Science  Foundation,  the  Tennessee  Valley  Authority—alto-
gether  25  federal  agencies  that  are  responsible  for  all  aspects  of  federal  water  re-
search and/or water resource management.

In  September  2007,  that  Subcommittee  released  a  report  with  detailed  rec-
ommendations  and  priorities  for  improving  coordination  and  water  research  in  the
U.S.  These  recommendations,  combined  with  additional  detailed  suggestions  from
the  2004  report  of  the  Committee  on  Assessment  of  Water  Resources  Research  of
the  National  Research  Council  (NRC)  and  reports  on  water  from  the  Government
Accountability Office (GAO) offer a superb starting point for moving water research
forward.

I support the important ideas behind Congressman Gordon’s newly submitted bill,
H.R. 1145, which clearly draws on these previous recommendations, and I commend
him  for  tackling  the  urgent  challenges  of  water.  It  is  time  to  move  from  rec-
ommendation to action, and the Nation needs some kind of group to define research,
monitor action, coordinate diverse federal efforts, and bring outside ideas to the at-
tention of agencies and policy-makers. I also support the idea of putting (or keeping)
that  agency  under  the  guidance  of  the  President’s  OSTP,  because  of  the  vital  need
for independent, high-quality science.

I would also like to offer some specific suggestions for strengthening the proposed

bill.

First,  it  is  not  clear  to  me  that  a  completely  new  interagency  committee  is  nec-
essary,  as  opposed  to  expanding  and  improving  the  efforts  of  the  existing  Sub-
committee on Water Availability and Quality within the National Science and Tech-
nology Council and other collaborative efforts underway between different agencies.
Whatever  approach  is  taken,  however,  a  coordinating  body  for  national  water  re-
search will need an explicit budget of its own, with new money. Agency budgets are
already grossly underfunded for water research and they are likely to chafe at hav-
ing  to  divert  funds  to  a  separate  independent  body.  This  group  should  also  include
water  experts  from  outside  of  the  federal  agencies  themselves—something  SWAQ
has  not  done.  The  National  Research  Council  previously  concluded  (in  its  2004  re-
port ‘‘Confronting the Nation’s Water Problems’’) that:

‘‘If  the  coordinating  body  is  made  up  only  of  agency  representatives,  the  over-
arching national perspective will likely devolve to the sum of agency wish lists.
However,  independence  from  agency  agendas  needs  to  be  balanced  by  close
interaction  with  agency  leaders  who  have  unique  and  valuable  perspectives  on
national needs.’’

Second, the Bill calls for the interagency committee to ‘‘establish the priorities for
federal  water  research.’’  I  believe  that  such  priorities  are  clearly,  and  comprehen-
sively,  laid  out  in  the  NRC,  SWAQ,  and  OMB  reports  already  available.  We  know
what  we  need  to  do;  what  is  needed  is  the  funding  and  effort  to  do  it.  As  a  result,
we  should  not  be  calling  for  a  new  assessment  of  need,  but  should  focus  on  the  ac-
tivities  in  Section  (c)(2)(C)  to  set  forth  ‘‘a  strategy  and  timeline  to  achieve  the’’  de-
sired outcomes.

Third, the explicit outcomes (Section (d) ) described in the proposed Bill are unnec-
essary,  if  existing  recommendations  from  the  SWAQ  and  NRC  reports  are  to  be
adopted.  Conversely,  if  this  Bill  is  to  include  specific  Water  Research  Outcomes,  I

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:01 Aug 30, 2009 Jkt 047553 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\FULL09\030409\47553 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

22

offer  here  some  explicit  recommendations  for  modest  changes:  some  key  outcomes
are  missing  and  should  be  added,  others  need  to  be  strengthened.  In  particular,
while  I  strongly  support  the  call  for  a  National  Water  Census,  that  Census  must
also include comprehensive information on water use—as recommended by SWAQ—
and  a  requirement  that  the  Census  be  made  easily  available  and  widely  dissemi-
nated. Thus, section (d)(1) should read:

‘‘(1) Implementation of a National Water Census, which shall include the collec-
tion  and  dissemination  of  data  on  national  water  resources  and  all  forms  of
water use, to create a comprehensive database that includes information on the
quantity,  availability,  quality,  and  use  of  ground  water  and  surface  water  re-
sources.’’

This  National  Census  is  urgently  needed,  and  I  further  urge  this  bill,  or  supple-
mental legislation, include a clear call for this work to be done by the U.S. Geologi-
cal  Survey,  which  has  the  experience  and  expertise  to  do  the  science  properly,  an
explicit  recommendation  that  such  as  Census  be  done  every  10  years,  and  a  clear
new  budget  of  at  least  $25  million  for  each  Census.  Spread  over  10  years  this  is
a tiny sum of money with potentially vast returns for the Nation.

Also missing from the Water Research Outcomes, but included in every recent call
for  water  research,  is  the  need  to  evaluate  both  the  implications  of  climate  change
for  the  Nation’s  water  resources  and  appropriate  technologies  and  water  manage-
ment  strategies  for  coping  with  unavoidable  impacts  of  climate  change.  An  addi-
tional ‘‘outcome’’ should therefore be added to section (d) that reads:

‘‘Improvement of the understanding of the impacts of climate change for the Na-
tion’s  water  resources  and  appropriate  strategies  for  adapting  to  those  climate
impacts that may be unavoidable.’’

Section (d)(4) calls for development of innovative technologies and tools to enhance
water-use efficiency. I fully support this effort, but this outcome should be expanded
to include technologies and tools that already exist but have yet to be widely imple-
mented. Wording for this section should be:

(4)  Expansion  of  efforts  to  enhance  the  efficiency  of  water  use  throughout  the
Nation  using  existing  technologies  and  tools  and  through  the  development  and
adoption of innovative new technologies and tools.’’

Let me also offer some comments and thoughts about funding, supporting my con-
clusion  that  some  new,  independent  funding  is  required  to  make  this  effort  work.
Federal  agency  research  budgets  are  typically  developed  starting  with  a  ‘‘base’’  of
activities  that  change  little  from  year  to  year,  and  adding  ‘‘above  base’’  initiatives.
In  the  context  of  developing  comprehensive  and  effective  national  water  research,
agencies are unlikely to give up any of their base, even to address higher water pri-
orities.  Furthermore,  the  congressional  appropriations  process  makes  it  difficult  to
shift funds from one agency to another when these agencies are funded through dif-
ferent  spending  bills.  Table  1  shows  just  a  sampling  of  the  different  appropriations
subcommittees that are responsible for some of the federal agencies that fund water.
This difficulty suggests that separate funds must be appropriated for whatever body
is set up to coordinate federal water policy and research. I also urge that the coordi-
nating body’s efforts be synchronized with the schedule of federal budgeting and ap-
propriations.

Additional Needs for Water Legislation, Policy, and Action

Finally, while implementing a new and better coordinated national research agen-
da  is  critical,  there  are  additional  needs  not  addressed  by  this  legislation.  The
United States has not had a comprehensive water commission in place for 30 years,
since the 1968 National Water Commission reported to the President and Congress
in  1973.  Moreover,  we  have  never  had  a  water  commission  with  the  authority  and
responsibility to review and recommend on the role of the U.S. in addressing inter-
national  water  issues.  Nor  has  such  a  commission  ever  addressed  the  new  chal-
lenges  of  climate  change.  Such  a  commission,  perhaps  in  the  form  of  a  ‘‘National
Water  Board’’  could  be  very  valuable.  A  version  of  such  a  Board  for  water-related
research was proposed by the National Research Council in their 2004 report ‘‘Con-
fronting  the  Nation’s  Water  Problems.’’  Indeed,  it  may  be  possible  and  appropriate
to combine the idea of an ‘‘interagency committee’’ in this bill with a broader Board.
The Pacific Institute has long supported such an idea. A National Water Commis-
sion or Board would be authorized by Congress, be composed of both federal agency
representatives  and  non-governmental  water  experts  from  across  the  many  dis-
ciplines affected, including the sciences, economics, public policy, law, governments,
public interest groups, and appropriate private sectors, would have a fixed term and
specific mandate, and would serve as a neutral third party to:

1. Provide  guidance  and  direction  on  the  appropriate  role  of  the  United  States

in addressing both national and international water issues.

2. Prepare a regular survey of water research activities and priorities.
3. Advise  Congress  and  OMB  on  the  recommended  focus  of  a  long-term  re-

search agenda and on key water budget decisions.

4. Report to OMB, OSTP, and the Congress in a timely manner compatible with

the budget and appropriations process.

The  NRC  concluded  that  such  a  Board  could  offer  both  Congress  and  OMB  cred-
ible advice on improving the efficiency with which federal agencies fund and conduct
water research and priorities.

Moreover such a Board could re-assess:

• Efforts to expand supply with new thinking on water re-use, desalina-
tion,  conjunctive  use,  and  other  non-traditional  supply  options.  In
most regions, even regions with growing scarcity, increasing supplies through
traditional  infrastructure  does  not  appear  to  be  the  most  efficient,  cost-effec-
tive,  and  timely  response.  In  contrast,  non-traditional  sources  of  supply  ap-
pear to offer enormous potential.

• Efforts  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  water  use  in  both  the  urban  and
agricultural sectors. One of the greatest opportunities for addressing water
scarcity and quality problems is by increasing the efficiency of water use and
reducing  waste.  Great  advances  have  been  made,  and  total  water  use  in  the
United States has actually decreased in the past 20 years, reducing pressure
on overall supply. Much more can be done.

• National  water  science  and  policy  and  offer  guidance  on  integrating  ef-
forts  now  scattered  among  disparate  and  uncoordinated  federal  agencies  and

24

departments.  National  budget  priorities  should  also  be  re-evaluated  and  re-
structured  to  ensure  that  the  national  objectives  are  more  clearly  supported.
• Revisions or better enforcement of national laws related to water, in-
cluding  laws  governing  water  quality  (the  Clean  Water  Act  and  the  Safe
Drinking  Water  Act),  the  protection  of  aquatic  ecosystems,  the  financing  of
water  infrastructure,  and  national  standards  for  improving  water-use  effi-
ciency and conservation.

• Recommendations for flood and drought management, including imple-

menting overdue changes proposed by previous reviews.

• The  physical  security  of  the  Nation’s  water,  by  highlighting  necessary
steps that could be taken to reduce overlap and streamline responsibilities of
the multiple federal agencies working on water issues.

• Recommendations  for  the  U.S.  role  in  identifying  and  addressing
global  water  problems,  including  how  to  significantly  accelerate  efforts  to
meet the large and devastating unmet basic human needs for water in poorer
countries. These recommendations should address how best to apply the vast
financial, educational, technological, and institutional expertise of the United
States to these problems.

• How to prepare the Nation’s water resources systems for the risks of

climatic changes.

• Recommendations  for  reducing  the  risks  of  international  tensions
over  shared  water  resources,  including  how  to  resolve  concerns  with  our
own  neighbors,  Mexico  and  Canada,  over  shared  water  systems.  These  rec-
ommendations  would  be  valuable  in  other  international  river  basins  where
our experience, international stature, and expertise can be effective.

The Need for U.S. Leadership

The  time  is  ripe  for  an  integrated  and  comprehensive  national  water  strategy.
While many water issues will remain local, to be resolved by community efforts, our
national government can no longer ignore the positive and effective role it can play
both  here  and  abroad.  The  United  States  is  well  positioned  to  be  a  world  leader  in
addressing water problems, yet the U.S. regularly fails to present the world commu-
nity  with  a  comprehensive,  integrated,  and  informed  set  of  positions  necessary  to
play a leadership role.

I congratulate you for considering this vital issue and for helping to raise national
attention  on  the  need  to  re-evaluate  and  re-focus  efforts  on  sustainably  managing
the Nation’s precious freshwater resources.

Thank you for your attention.

BIOGRAPHY FOR PETER H. GLEICK

Dr.  Peter  H.  Gleick  is  co-founder  and  President  of  the  Pacific  Institute  in  Oak-
land,  California.  The  Institute  is  one  of  the  world’s  leading  non-partisan  policy  re-
search  groups  addressing  global  environment  and  development  problems,  especially
in  the  area  of  freshwater  resources.  Dr.  Gleick  was  described  by  the  San  Francisco
Chronicle  in  2009  as  ‘‘arguably  the  world’s  leading  expert  on  water.’’  His  research
and  writing  address  the  hydrologic  impacts  of  climate  change,  sustainable  water
use,  water  privatization,  and  international  conflicts  over  water  resources.  His  work
on  sustainable  management  and  use  of  water  led  to  him  being  named  by  the  BBC
as  a  ‘‘visionary  on  the  environment’’  in  its  Essential  Guide  to  the  21st  Century.  In
2008,  Wired  Magazine  called  him  ‘‘one  of  15  People  the  Next  President  Should  Lis-
ten To.’’

Dr. Peter H. Gleick produced some of the first research on the implications of cli-
mate  change  for  water  resources.  He  has  also  played  a  leading  role  in  highlighting
the risks to national and international security from conflicts over shared water re-
sources.  He  produced  some  of  the  earliest  assessments  of  the  connections  between
water and political disputes and has briefed major international policy-makers rang-
ing from the Vice President and Secretary of State of the United States to the Prime
Minister of Jordan on these issues. He also has testified regularly for the U.S. Sen-
ate, House of Representatives, and State legislatures, and briefed international gov-
ernments and policy-makers.

Dr.  Gleick  received  a  B.S.  from  Yale  University  and  an  M.S.  and  Ph.D.  from  the
University of California, Berkeley. In 2003 he received a MacArthur Foundation Fel-
lowship for his work on global freshwater issues. In 2006 he was elected to the U.S.

Chair GORDON. Thank you. And Mr. Modzelewski, you are recog-

nized for five minutes.

STATEMENT OF MR. F. MARK MODZELEWSKI, EXECUTIVE

DIRECTOR, WATER INNOVATIONS ALLIANCE

Mr. MODZELEWSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and again,
I  thank  Mr.  Chair  and  the  Members  of  the  Committee.  I  am  hon-
ored to have this opportunity to appear before you today as Execu-
tive Director of the Water Innovations Alliance. The alliance is the
policy  voice  of  the  world’s  water  researchers,  technologists,  and
innovators,  and  our  members  are  looking  to  move  forward  to  ad-
dress many of the problems that we have here today.

I would like to actually skip over the statistics which I think we
all  know  so  well  and  really  get  to  the  point  that  in  order  to  advo-
cate  and  address  the  problems  that  exist  in  the  developing  world
and  our  significant  infrastructure  needs  and  needs  with  water,  we
must either spend hundreds of billions of dollars, some people put-
ting  the  number  at  trillions  of  dollars,  in  order  to  fix  it  and  mod-
ernize the system, or for a fraction of that we can invest in funding
that  will  advance  water  technology  and  innovations  and  spend  the
money smartly, which is something we all need to focus on.

Unfortunately,  despite  many  of  these  maxims  that  water  is  the
next  oil,  that  water  equals  life,  nobody  ever  seems  to  put  their
money where their mouth is in the water sector and actually spend
the  funding  along  these  lines.  Corporate  and  government  R&D
spending  in  water  compared  to  other  industries  is  quite  low,  and
I could speak to one area that I am very familiar with for formerly
running the Nano-Business Alliance.

In nanotechnology every year the Federal Government spends in
excess  of  a  billion  and  a  half  dollars,  corporations  putting  signifi-
cant  amounts  along  those  lines.  If  you  look  at  that  in  water,  you
really  don’t  see  those  kind  of  funding  levels  hit,  and  you  also  see
the funding, again, speaking with what Dr. Vaux said earlier, real-
ly  puts  near-term  problems.  You  don’t  see  a  lot  of  mid  and  long-
term research developed along those lines.

And in fact, we are still really treating water not that differently
than we could have a couple hundred years ago where we actually
put  chemicals  or  poisons  in  the  water,  or  we  tried  to  force  things
through small holes. And we really haven’t looked to address water
in a more modern way, with more modern techniques. And the lack
of  funding  and  the  lack  of  a  funding  portfolio  that  is  spread  and
diverse  in  this  effect  has  surely  caused  that  and  is  clearly  a  hin-
drance to us being able to deal with things along those lines.

We strongly agree with the Chair’s call for interagency collabora-
tion  and  coordination  as  well  as  increased  evaluation  and  funding.
We  strongly  support  the  proposals  here  under  consideration,  but
we  do  have  actually  a  few  areas  that  we  would  like  to  make  sug-
gestions  for  development  in  the  bill  and  some  potential  changes  in
the bill.

One of which would be assessment. To date there have been sev-
eral  efforts  to  evaluate  the  state  of  water  infrastructure  and  re-
search  spending  in  America,  including  the  work  of  the  National
Academies  and  several  private  organizations.  None  has  been  thor-
ough enough to create a clear picture and to develop a comprehen-
sive  response.  At  this  time  the  essence  we  believe  that  it  is  nec-
essary to get the tests done quickly, thoroughly, and accurately.

We suggest a natural water census which Dr. Gleick had touched
upon earlier, but we would certainly agree with him that usage and
regularity  should  be  a  point  of  development  as  far  as  that  census
goes.  We  should  look  at  the  availability  of  quantity,  quality,  con-
sumption, recharge capacity, and threats to ground water and sur-
face water resources as well.

Another  area  which  we  think  is  deeply  in  need  of  investigation
is  the  information  technology  area  of  water.  One  key  area  where
there  has  been  a  lack  of  innovation  of  water  is  information  tech-
nology.  Little  has  been  done  to  create  a  common  system  in  meas-
urement,  evaluation,  and  reporting.  Common  standards  do  not
exist. Even with the current infrastructure filtration and treatment
technology,  overlaying  an  effective  IT  infrastructure  and  manage-
ment  system  whereby  we  could  actually  evaluate  what  is  being
done  and  what  is  being  used  and  have  a  common  language  of  re-
porting and sharing that information by some estimates could lead
to savings of 30 to 50 percent, even with the current infrastructure
issues that we have.

A  national  smart  water  grid,  if  you  will,  would  be  an  incredible
way  of  better  developing  water,  understanding  our  water  use,  and
being able to understand what is working and what is not working
as far as our new innovations and technologies that are applied.

Another  area  I  would  like  to  point  to  is  NSF  Centers.  This  is
something  that  has  been  touched  on  before  as  far  as  research  cen-
ters, and these certainly could be done in conjuncture with the cur-
rent university centers or a build-out of the centers, but right now
we  have  one  at  the  University  of  Illinois,  which  I  believe  sunsets
in  the  next  three  years.  Having  nationally-backed,  long-term  fund-
ing  structures  for  the  research  and  innovations  of  water  would  be
an incredible development that we could move forward on.

The  government  in  Switzerland,  for  instance,  a  country  that  is
actually  quite  water  rich  and  much  smaller  than  ours,  spends  100
million  a  year  in  these  type  of  government  centers  and  would  be
a model to look at for developing out our own system.

And  lastly,  a  national  water  pilot  testing  facility.  One  issue  that
we  seem  to  have  right  now  is  that  regulation  gets  in  the  way  of
a  lot  of  innovation  being  out  there,  and  too  often  the  innovation  is
occurring  at  the  bench  top  in  laboratories,  rather  than  under-
standing how it would work in a larger system. So the development
of  such  a  water  pilot  testing  facility  would  be  integral  to  actually
getting new innovation available and in the market.

Thank you, Mr. Chair.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF F. MARK MODZELEWSKI

Chairman  Gordon,  Ranking  Member  Hall,  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  am
pleased and honored to have this opportunity to appear before you today as the Ex-
ecutive Director of the Water Innovations Alliance. The Alliance is the public policy

voice  of  the  world’s  water  researchers,  technologists  and  innovators.  Our  role  is  to
advocate policies that promote the aggressive development of water technologies and
innovations across all sectors and users of water by creating new market opportuni-
ties, increasing funding, strengthening research and development programs, remov-
ing  regulatory  and  market  barriers,  and  improving  education,  communication  and
outreach efforts.

Our  membership,  which  includes  a  broad  spectrum  of  business,  academic  institu-
tions,  health  and  development  activists,  believes  strongly  in  the  tremendous  impor-
tance  of  securing  safe  and  affordable  access  to  water  resources  as  a  cornerstone  of
our  nation’s  physical  health,  economic  prosperity,  and  general  welfare.  We  share
this committee’s belief that federal investment in water technology R&D is essential
for our nation’s future—and the world’s.

We  are  all  familiar  with  the  statistics:  in  2002,  1.1  billion  people  lacked  access
to  a  reliable  water  supply,  and  2.6  billion  people  lacked  access  to  adequate  sanita-
tion.  By  2025,  over  half  the  world’s  population  will  live  in  water-stressed  or  water-
scarce  countries.  Twenty-five  percent  of  global  freshwater  use  exceeds  local  long-
term  accessible  supplies.  Agricultural  uses  are  the  biggest  concern,  with  an  esti-
mated 15 to 35 percent of irrigation withdrawals in excess of sustainable limits. In-
dustrial  withdrawals  of  water  are  expected  to  rise  by  55  percent  out  to  the  year
2025.  In  addition,  within  the  U.S.,  population  has  been  migrating  from  the  water-
rich  North  to  the  water-depleted  sunbelt.  Crumbling  infrastructure  means  that  cit-
ies such as Chicago lose upwards of 60 percent of their water in transit from treat-
ment  facilities  to  faucets.  Over  the  past  five  years,  municipal  water  rates  have  in-
creased 27 percent throughout the United States.

In  order  to  address  the  problems  of  access  in  the  developing  world  and  our  own
significant infrastructure needs, we must either spend hundreds of billions of dollars
on  current  technology  or  invest  a  fraction  of  that  funding  in  advancing  water  tech-
nology.  Unfortunately,  despite  the  maxims  that  ‘‘water  is  the  next  oil,’’  and  that
‘‘water  equals  life,’’  nobody  ever  seems  to  put  their  money  where  their  mouth  is  in
the  water  sector—corporate  and  government  R&D  investment  has  historically  been
far  below  the  level  we  see  in  less  important  industries.  The  proposed  legislation  is
a  major  step  toward  reversing  this  trend.  It  will  help  develop  and  bring  to  market
new  technologies  that  allow  for  greater  efficiencies,  the  ability  to  re-use  this  pre-
cious resource, and new capabilities to tap new water sources.

We strongly agree with the Chairman’s calls for interagency collaboration and co-
ordination, as well as increased evaluation and funding for water technology. Before
founding  the  Water  Innovations  Alliance,  I  founded  the  NanoBusiness  Alliance,
where  I  worked  extensively  on  the  21st  Century  Nanotechnology  Research  and  De-
velopment Act. I believe that it can serve as a great model for interagency coordina-
tion and public-private collaboration on key issues surrounding water technology.

General Comments on the Proposal

While the Water Innovations Alliance strongly supports the Chairman’s proposal,
we  do  have  a  few  suggestion  for  the  Committee’s  consideration.  In  general,  we
would encourage the Committee to take an aggressive approach to water innovation
that ensures speed, quality and accountability. We also urge that the Committee en-
courage  new  voices  to  come  to  the  table  and  create  opportunities  for  interdiscipli-
nary  research.  We  still  deal  with  water  technology  with  brute  force  methods  that
use  hazardous  chemicals,  heat  and  pressure.  Nearly  all  research  has  been  focused
on little tweaks to make these processes marginally cleaner or more energy efficient,
rather  than  exploring  game-changing  new  approaches.  Finding  and  implementing
these  new  approaches  will  require  outside-the-box  thinking  and  longer-term  vision.
In addition, we need to find ways to spur innovation among small businesses in the
water sector, where innovation has the greatest chance of taking root.

Specific Suggestions for the Proposal
Assessment: To date, there have been several efforts to evaluate the state of water
infrastructure  and  research  spending  in  America,  including  work  at  the  National
Academies  and  several  private  organizations.  None  has  been  thorough  enough  to
create  a  clear  picture  and  a  develop  a  comprehensive  response.  As  time  is  of  the
essence, we believe it is necessary to get the task done quickly, thoroughly, and ac-
curately. We suggest a National Water Census, the collection of water data to create
a  comprehensive  database  of  information  on  available  quantity,  quality,  consump-
tion, recharge capacity and threats to ground water and surface water resources. To
maintain  this  information  resource,  we  recommend  the  development  of  a  new  gen-
eration of water monitoring techniques and technologies.

Information  Technology  (IT):  One  key  area  where  there  is  a  lack  of  innovation
in  water  is  in  information  technologies.  Little  has  been  done  to  create  a  common
system for measurement, evaluation and reporting. Common standards do not exist.
Even  with  current  infrastructure,  filtration,  and  treatment  technology,  the  over-
laying  of  an  effective  IT  management  system  could  result  in  annual  savings  of  30–
50 percent. It is vital that an effort be made to create and fund a water information
technology initiative through partnership with the IT industry to develop and deploy
a  common  platform—a  national  ‘‘smart  water  grid,’’  if  you  will—within  the  water
sector.  A  coordinated  effort  could  result  in  a  system  being  in  place  in  just  a  few
years that would save money and provide data to support bolder moves to conserve
and manage water.
NSF Centers: The lack of water R&D progress indicates a need for federal research
centers for water technology and innovation. There are 15 NSF nanotechnology cen-
ters  as  well  as  additional  ones  from  other  federal  agencies  including  centers  at  a
number  of  the  DOE  labs.  Yet  only  one  center  exists  for  water  R&D.  That  center,
at  the  University  of  Illinois,  is  set  to  sunset  in  three  years.  To  create  new  national
research  centers,  additional  long-term  funding  will  be  needed.  Other  nations  estab-
lishing  such  centers  commit  funding  for  ten  years  at  a  time,  with  similar  invest-
ments by the private sector. Switzerland, a country that is water rich and a fraction
of  our  size,  is  spending  approximately  $100  million  per  year  to  develop  new  tech-
nologies to reduce domestic water usage, particularly in its energy sector. It is likely
that  a  greater  level  of  funding  will  be  needed  in  the  U.S.  to  solve  the  larger  prob-
lems the we face over several major sectors and across disparate geographic regions.
The  Alliance  strongly  urges  the  creation  of  a  minimum  of  five  new  NSF  water  cen-
ters,  each  tasked  with  a  specific  focus  area  (e.g.,  IT,  desalination,  purification)  to
begin to address the multitude of pressing needs in the water technology field.
National Water Pilot Testing Facility: In water R&D, one of the largest hurdles
beyond funding has been the gap between bench-top research and real-world condi-
tions.  There  are  few  opportunities  for  researchers  to  test  their  new  developments
under  real-world  conditions  due  to  regulatory  hurdles  that  deter  experimentation
and  the  absence  of  a  pilot  testing  facility  for  water.  The  Alliance  strongly  encour-
ages the Committee to consider creating a national water pilot testing facility to be
housed at a national laboratory or a university. In addition, we encourage the Com-
mittee to examine the regulatory barriers that hinder innovation and testing of new
beneficial solutions for the water industry.

Thank  you,  Chairman  Gordon,  Ranking  Member  Hall,  and  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee  for  the  opportunity  to  provide  this  testimony.  I  would  be  happy  to  answer
any questions you may have.

Chair  GORDON.  Thank  you.  And  now  Ms.  Stoner,  you  are  recog-

nized for five minutes.
STATEMENT OF MS. NANCY K. STONER, CO-DIRECTOR, WATER
PROGRAM, NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL (NRDC)
Ms.  STONER.  Thank  you.  Good  morning,  Mr.  Chair,  Ranking

Member Hall, and Members——

Chair  GORDON.  I  believe  you  need  to  put  your  microphone  on

there. There we go.

Ms. STONER. Very good. Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity
to  appear  before  you  today  on  behalf  of  the  Natural  Resources  De-
fense  Council  to  discuss  the  changes  facing  U.S.  water  resources
today  and  the  role  of  scientific  research  in  addressing  those  chal-
lenges.  I  will  provide  a  brief  summary  of  the  issues  presented  in
more depth in my written statement.

First,  water  resources  in  the  U.S.  are  stressed.  Population
growth,  urbanization,  and  agricultural  runoff  continue  to  pollute
rivers,  lakes,  and  coastal  waters  and  deplete  surface  and  ground
water  resources  that  provide  safe,  sufficient  water  for  human  and
ecosystem needs.

There  are  also  new  stressors  as  my  colleagues  have  mentioned
such  as  climate  change,  which  affects  water  first  and  foremost
among  all  natural  resources  with  increasing  droughts,  sea  level
rise, extreme storm events, and increased stream temperatures. We
can’t  continue  to  use  the  strategies  of  the  past  and  hope  to  over-
come  these  and  other  emerging  challenges.  New  strategies,  new
technologies,  and  even  new  ways  of  thinking  are  needed.  That  is
what scientific research is all about.

Second, water is valuable. It is essential to life, to our very exist-
ence, and the foundation of every civilization. It is easily worth bil-
lions,  if  not  trillions  of  dollars  each  year  to  the  U.S.  economy.  One
study by a team of economists estimates the economic value of the
decline  in  water  quality  in  the  U.S.  from  1994,  to  2000,  is  $20  bil-
lion.  With  the  economic  crisis  that  the  U.S.  is  facing,  we  can’t  af-
ford to throw away valuable natural resources like clean water.

Third,  research  and  development  creates  jobs,  jobs  for  scientists,
lab technicians, manufacturing jobs, labor jobs, jobs that feed fami-
lies  and  contribute  to  the  long-term  health  and  well-being  of  the
Nation.

The  global  water  and  waste  water  infrastructure  market  is  esti-
mated  at  $3  trillion.  The  U.S.  needs  to  invest  in  research  and  de-
velopment,  not  only  to  protect  our  own  natural  resources  but  also
to  bolster  that  sector  of  our  economy.  We  are  currently  losing  jobs
to  companies  overseas  because  we  are  not  developing  and  mar-
keting  state-of-the-art  water  and  waste  water  infrastructure  tech-
nologies.  This  is  a  market  in  which  the  U.S.  can  and  should  lead
the world.

With  respect  to  the  legislation,  H.R.  1145,  the  National  Water
Research  and  Development  Initiative  Act,  it  would  step  up  and  co-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:01 Aug 30, 2009 Jkt 047553 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\FULL09\030409\47553 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

ordinate science-based research in water. It would ensure that fed-
eral  dollars  are  spent  more  effectively  and  would  identify  specific
water research outcomes.

I  want  to  add  to  those  voices  of  my  colleagues  in  suggesting  a
couple  of  additional  outcomes.  Several  have  mentioned  already  cli-
mate  change  water  interactions.  I  think  that  is  very  important  for
a research outcome. Another that hasn’t been mentioned this morn-
ing  I  think  is  advanced  treatment  technologies  and  pollution  pre-
vention  strategies.  Treatment  may  be  old-school,  but  sometimes  it
is  helpful,  and  we  need  new  treatment  technologies,  particularly
ones that use less energy and produce better results. That is a good
area  for  the  research  agenda  as  well.  I  think  it  is  an  excellent
start, though, on a holistic cross-cutting water research agenda.

I  also  want  to  second  the  comment  made  by  my  colleague,  Dr.
Gleick,  about  having  the  census  address  water  use.  Often  in  the
U.S.  we  don’t  have  information  about  how  much  ground  water  in
particular  is  being  used.  That  information  is  necessary  in  order  to
ensure that we have sustainable water resources for the future.

So I commend you, Mr. Chair, on this legislation, and I welcome

your questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF NANCY K. STONER

Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  I  appreciate  the
opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today  to  discuss  the  challenges  facing  U.S.  water
resources  today  and  the  role  of  scientific  research  in  addressing  those  challenges.
I  will  also  specifically  address  the  legislative  proposals  under  consideration  by  this

Water Resource Challenges in the U.S. in the 21st Century

Earlier this year, EPA released its 2004 National Water Quality Inventory Report
to  Congress.  Unfortunately,  it  demonstrates  that  very  high  percentage  of  our  na-
tion’s surface waters continue to be unsafe for swimming, drinking, fishing, or other
human uses.

In 2006, U.S. EPA released its first Wadeable Streams Assessment of the biologi-
cal  integrity  of  1,392  perennial  streams  across  the  U.S.  using  direct  measures  of
aquatic  life.  It  found  41.9  percent  of  streams  in  poor  condition,  24.9  percent  in  fair
condition, and only 28.2 percent in good condition.2

These  reports  focus  primarily  on  water  quality.  However,  our  natural  water  sys-
tems  and  services  are  also  deteriorating.  Signs  of  stress  are  seen  in  falling  ground-
water levels and decreasing stream flows, degradation of aquifer water quality, dis-
appearance of wetlands, dead zones in coastal areas such as the Gulf of Mexico, and
other changes in hydrologic function.

Many of these negative changes are a result of ill-conceived agricultural, land de-
velopment, and energy practices—and are symptoms of man’s overuse and contami-
nation  of  water.  Destruction  of  natural  ecosystems  such  as  wetlands,  forests,  and
prairies  to  make  way  for  sprawling  cities  that  pave  over  the  landscape  destroying
natural  hydrology,  and  monoculture  farming  that  requires  excessive  quantities  of
water and fertilizer have led to drying land masses and reduced evapotranspiration,
as  well  as  increases  in  polluted  runoff.  In  order  to  assure  secure  and  clean  water
supplies and healthy ecosystems, it will be necessary to redesign the Nation’s infra-
structure around significantly more efficient and sustainable practices.

Climate change is exacerbating stresses on water resources. From urban and agri-
cultural water supplies to flood management and protecting aquatic ecosystems, all
aspects of water resource management are being affected by climate change. Rising
temperatures,  loss  of  snowpack,  escalating  size  and  frequency  of  flood  events,  in-
creasingly  frequent  droughts,  and  sea  level  rise  are  just  some  of  the  impacts  of  cli-
mate  change  that  have  broad  implications  to  the  management  of  water  resources.
Many  water  supply  sources  (rivers,  lakes,  groundwater  basins,  etc.)  are  already
over-allocated,  suffer  from  degraded  water  quality  and  are  often  not  in  sufficient
condition  to  support  endangered  species.  The  past  is  no  longer  a  tool  for  predicting
future precipitation patterns. While droughts are nothing new, climate change is not
only predicted to increase the frequency and intensity of droughts but will also effec-
tively  create  ongoing  drought-like  conditions  in  parts  of  the  U.S.3 In  response  to  a
U.S. General Accounting Office survey in 2003, 36 states indicated that they antici-
pate local, regional, or statewide water shortages by 2013.4

By  elevating  temperatures,  increasing  evaporation  rates  and  extending  dry  sea-
sons,  even  existing  rainfall  patterns  will  yield  less  in  terms  of  real  water  supplies.
Ironically,  global  warming  is  also  predicted  to  increase  the  frequency  and  intensity
of  storm  events,  which  will  in  some  cases  provide  more  overall  rainfall.  However,
intense rain events often deliver too much water at once causing it to runoff instead
of soaking into the ground, making it harder to store in reservoirs. Some areas, par-
ticularly  in  the  West  and  Southeast,  are  predicted  to  get  less  precipitation.  These
climate  change  related  effects,  likely  in  combination,  will  decrease  water  supplies
both locally and regionally throughout the country.5

There  is  also  emerging  research  suggesting  that  the  drying  out  of  land  and  air
may also have a direct effect on the rate of climate change.6 Additional research on
this  topic  could  revolutionize  the  drivers  for  water  resource  management  inter-
nationally. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is essential, and the water sector can
be part of any solution by reducing energy use through water conservation and effi-
ciency,  rainwater  harvesting,  and  groundwater  recharge  through  practices  such  as
low  impact  development.  Greenhouse  gas  emissions  can  also  be  used  through  prac-
tices,  such  as  reduced  fertilizer  use,  that  also  reduce  nutrient  pollution.  However,
reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  will  take  time  and  there  is  a  need  to  address
today’s  challenges.  Implementing  actions  now  to  improve  water  quality  and  sup-
plies,  protect  aquatic  ecosystems  and  improve  flood  management  not  only  make
sense,  but  early  action  will  also  help  reduce  future  impacts  related  to  climate
change.7 Adaptation  is  not  a  solution  to  climate  change  but  given  the  importance
of  our  water  resources,  immediate  action  is  needed  to  avert  significant  societal  im-
pacts.  Research  into  the  tools  that  communities  need  to  anticipate  impacts  of  cli-
mate  change  to  their  water  resources  and  the  best  set  of  adaptation  strategies  to
prepare for those impacts is an immediate need.

Our  nation’s  water  infrastructure  was  built  around  the  goal  of  public  health  pro-
tection through long-distance transport of clean water into cities and of wastewater
away  from  cities.  These  systems  were  extremely  successful  in  improving  public
health in the U.S., particularly during the first half of the 20th century. Now, how-
ever,  these  same  systems  are  increasingly  seen  as  out-of-date  and  insufficient  to
meet  water  resource  and  public  health  goals.  Scarce  water  resources  are  wasted
through  designs  that  transport  water  and  wastewater  long  distances  for  filtration
and treatment and by once-and-done treatment processes that discharge treated wa-
ters into streams to be carried out to sea instead of using it for landscape irrigation,
toilet flushing, cooling water, and other non-potable needs.

The  National  Academy  of  Engineering  has  recently  listed  three  of  the  new  Cen-
tury’s  ‘‘Grand  Challenges  for  Engineering’’  as  related  to  water:  restoring  and  im-
proving urban infrastructure; providing access to clean water; and managing the ni-
trogen  cycle  (including  nitrogen  in  wastewater).8 The  Academy  recognized  that  an
integrated  approach  combining  energy,  water,  and  wastes  (liquid  and  solid)  into
‘‘neighborhood  systems’’  needs  consideration.  These  systems  will  rely  on  telemetry
and  information  networks,  and  will  incorporate  aesthetic  designs.  As  the  Academy
suggests, ‘‘proper engineering approaches can achieve multiple goals, such as better
storm drainage and cleaner water, while also enhancing the appearance of the land-
scape,  improving  the  habitat  for  wildlife,  and  offering  recreational  spaces  for  peo-
ple.’’

The  value  of  designing  buildings  and  subdivisions  with  both  energy  and  water
considerations  in  mind  is  becoming  more  clear  among  green  building  practitioners.
Water management, for example, is included in the recent Net Zero Energy Building
report  prepared  by  an  interagency  task  force  called  the  National  Science  and  Tech-
nology Council.9 Wastewater has heat that can be captured, and biogas can be gen-
erated  at  a  local  scale  from  sewage,  along  with  food  waste  and  landscaping  mate-
rials.  Energy  costs  for  water  line  and  sewer  pumping  stations  can  be  avoided  if
water  is  captured,  recycled  and  re-used  within  its  natural  or  originating  basin.  It
only  makes  sense,  then,  to  provide  tax  incentives,  public  building  retrofit  require-
ments,  and  loan  guarantees  for  both  energy  and  water  technology  advancements
within  a  single  program.  Other  ‘‘market  transformational’’  approaches,  such  as  la-
beling  and  standards  development  for  energy-efficient  appliances  and  for  solar  and
wind technologies, could also be adopted. EPA’s WaterSense program provides data
for  consumers  to  choose  water-efficient  appliances  and  landscape  irrigation  serv-
ices.10 The  success  of  this  program  suggests  that  some  similar  guidelines  for  water
and wastewater re-use and stormwater management should also be developed.

Treatment  approaches  typically  used  are  also  insufficient  to  address  the  broad
range  of  contaminants  found  in  sewage,  including  excessive  nutrients,  microbials,
such  as  cryptosporidium  and  giardia,  and  pharmaceuticals  and  personal  care  prod-
ucts  (PPCPs)  that  are  contaminating  our  waterways  and  have  the  potential  to
threaten  public  health.  The  problem  of  unintended  movement  of  toxic  and  endo-
crine-disrupting  chemicals  and  compounds  from  pharmaceuticals  and  personal  care

products  to  wastewater  effluents  and  drinking  water  sources  is  neither  new  nor
unique  to  the  U.S.  It  is  an  international  problem  that  has  been  documented  and
publicly reported by government experts and academic researchers for over two dec-
ades.11 It is complicated by the fact that the contaminants come from many sources
(medical waste, consumer waste, agriculture and industrial uses, etc.), have diverse
toxicology  profiles  and  biological  activity,  may  be  present  in  low  or  trace  amounts
(parts per trillion), and are likely to have complex and poorly understood toxic inter-
actions (antagonistic, synergistic, additive, etc.). However, these contaminants share
one  very  disturbing  characteristic:  in  general,  they  are  not  effectively  controlled
under U.S. environmental statutes, and are usually not even subject to monitoring.
Research into green chemistry, wastestream minimization, and other ways to mini-
mize  the  risk  to  people  and  ecosystems  from  these  substances  must  become  a  pri-
ority.

Economic benefits of clean, safe water resources

Abundant,  safe  water  resources  are  essential  to  a  healthy  U.S.  economy  as  well
as to human and ecosystem health. For example, a new report by scientists working
with Restore America’s Estuaries found that beach going in the U.S. contributes up
to $30 billion annually to the U.S. economy and recreational fishing contributes be-
tween  $10  and  $26  billion.12 On  the  flipside,  economists  from  Vanderbilt  and  Duke
Universities estimate the annual economic value of the decline in inland U.S. water
quality  from  1994  to  2000  to  be  more  than  $20  billion.13 With  the  economic  crisis
that  the  U.S.  is  facing,  we  cannot  afford  to  be  throwing  away  valuable  natural  re-
sources like clean water.

Directing  federal  research  funding  towards  addressing  the  challenges  facing  U.S.
water  resources  will  make  the  U.S.  stronger,  our  families  healthier,  our  wildlife
more  abundant,  and  our  communities  safer  and  more  resilient  to  future  water  and
climate  disturbances.  Those  research  dollars  will  also  provide  immediate  employ-
ment  to  scientists,  technicians,  equipment  manufacturers,  laborers,  and  other  a
whole  host  of  other  Americans  who  can  feed  their  families  today  and  contribute  to
the long-term health and well being of the Nation.

Investment  in  research  and  development  and  demonstration  projects  in

21st Century water infrastructure

The U.S. has experienced a dramatic reduction in water-related research funding
in  the  Federal  Government,  as  has  been  noted  by  both  the  National  Academy  of
Sciences and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The 1972 Clean Water Act
authorized  $100  million  in  research,  which  would  be  worth  over  $500  million  per
year in current dollars. However, starting in the 1980s, water infrastructure-related
research budgets were systematically reduced, and private sector research spending
declined as well.

Because of these continuing reductions in water-related research in the U.S., aca-
demic institutions, research institutes, and consulting firms have been reducing em-
ployment  as  well.  Dramatic  signs  of  this  under-employment  include  the  relocation
of  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  water  researchers  to  Singapore,  where
$300 million is being invested by that government in innovative technology develop-
ment in water infrastructure, which will allow them to take a leadership role in cap-
turing  the  estimated  $3  trillion  dollar  water  and  wastewater  infrastructure  mar-
ket.14 Graduate  students,  for  lack  of  funding  in  the  U.S.,  are  accepting  fellowships
overseas.  Science  departments  are  being  shut  down,  hiring  freezes  and  layoffs  are
occurring at campuses across the U.S. Consulting research firms have also shed nu-
merous workers in recent months.

By a host of measures, it would be appropriate to build research and development
(R&D) funding in the water infrastructure field over a period of years to a $500 mil-
lion  per  year  level.  Any  healthy  industrial  sector  should  be  reinvesting  one  to  two
percent  in  science  and  new  product  development.  One  percent  of  the  Nation’s  cur-
rent estimated $50 billion water and wastewater sector expenditures would be $500
million  per  year,  while  one  percent  of  the  approximately  $100  billion  per  year  that
the water and wastewater sectors should be spending on traditional and green infra-
structure approaches to meet current needs would be $1 billion per year.

To  begin  returning  water  infrastructure-related  research  to  an  appropriate  level
of  funding,  at  least  $100  million  should  be  appropriated  for  EPA  to  stimulate  both
R&D  and  demonstration  projects  in  21st  Century  approaches,  including  water  con-
servation,  rainwater  harvesting,  green  infrastructure,  groundwater  remediation,
graywater  re-use,  optimizing  energy  use  and  water  quality,  monitoring  for  and
treating  emerging  contaminants,  and  decentralized  wastewater  treatment  and  re-
use.  A  second  $100  million  should  be  employed  for  innovative  water  management
research  in  the  Departments  of  Agriculture,  Commerce,  Defense,  Energy,  Health
and  Human  Services,  Housing  and  Urban  Development,  Interior,  and  Transpor-
tation  to  look  at  a  host  of  water-related  issues  such  as  ensuring  safe  water  supply,
protection  of  aquatic  habitat,  sustainable  water  and  wastewater  infrastructure  in
the  built  environment,  protection  of  U.S.  fisheries,  protection  of  and  stewardship  of
America’s  farmlands,  pasturelands,  and  forests,  protection  of  endangered  species,
and, of course, monitoring our progress in achieving water resource goals. A commit-
ment  to  rigorous  long-term  monitoring  of  our  nation’s  water  ways  is  absolutely  es-
sential  for  identifying  contaminants,  characterizing  and  localizing  contamination
patterns, identifying sources of contamination where possible, and measuring the ef-
fectiveness  of  mitigation  measures.  In  summary,  high  quality  monitoring  programs
are  required  for  Congress  and  regulatory  agencies  to  allocate  resources  wisely  and
effectively.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for the two main water-quality
monitoring  programs  for  the  Nation’s  waterways.  These  are  the  National  Water
Quality  Assessment  Program  (NAWQA)  and  the  Toxic  Substances  Hydrology  Pro-
gram. These two programs are crucial to understand water quality. Without a long-
term  commitment  to  monitoring,  the  Nation  will  lose  its  ability  to  assess  tends  in
water  quality,  impacts  of  climate  change,  impacts  of  new  and  under-studied  con-
taminants,  and  efficacy  of  policy-decisions  that  impact  water  quality.  The  NAWQA
is the larger of the two USGS water-quality monitoring programs, and looks at envi-
ronmental  contaminants  using  established  measurement  methodologies  for  meas-
uring  (pesticides,  VOCs,  metals,  etc.).  Budget  constraints  over  the  last  eight  years
has forced the program to cut back from 496 surface-water fixed station water-qual-
ity  monitoring  sites  in  2000,  to  only  113  sites  in  2008.15 NRDC  supports  reinvest-
ment in that program.

The  Toxic  Substances  Hydrology  (aka  Toxics  Program)  is  the  smaller  of  the  two
programs.  It  is  a  water  quality  research  and  methods  development  program  that
looks  at  new  and  understudied  environmental  contaminants,  like  new  pesticides,
hormones,  pharmaceuticals,  personal  care  products,  etc.  The  program  develops  new
capabilities,  new  methodologies,  and  new  information  that  enable  the  cooperative
water quality programs across states and the NAWQA address new issues in an ef-
fective manner.16 A new water research initiative should invest in both of these pro-
grams, which have been devastated by budget cuts in recent years.

In  addition  to  governmental  funding,  cooperative  efforts  with  utilities,  research
associations,  and  other  non-governmental  entities  should  be  part  of  the  research
agenda,  including  such  programs  as  the  National  Decentralized  Water  Resources
Capacity Development Project at the Water Environment Research Foundation, the
National Environmental Services Center at West Virginia University, and academic
workshop and conference funding.

The National Water Research and Development Initiative Act of 2009

The  National  Water  Research  and  Development  Initiative  Act  (NWRDIA)  of  2009
would  coordinate  such  a  research  initiative  and  develop  a  plan  for  identifying  and
prioritizing  future  research  needs.  Efforts  to  define  research  needs  and  projects  re-
lated  to  21st  Century  water  infrastructure  are  already  being  conducted  at  the  fed-
eral  level.  The  U.S.  EPA  has  directed  a  wide-ranging  series  of  working  groups  to
identify  critical  research  needs  in  water  infrastructure,  and  topics  for  priority  re-
search  projects  have  been  identified.  Research  agendas  have  been  developed  for
‘‘sustainable  infrastructure,’’  water  and  climate  change,  and  green  building  and
green infrastructure related to water systems. EPA has initiatives in related Smart
Growth,  source  water  protection,  and  ecological  services  program  areas.  This  com-
mittee has identified research areas for water-efficiency and conservation measures
in  H.R.  3957.  The  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy  has  identified  key  re-
search areas which would be developed in a revitalized water research program. The
NWRDIA would be helpful in coordinating these and other agenda-setting exercises

into  a  cross-agency,  cross-media,  cross-sectorial  strategy  that  gets  past  the  historic
siloed and disintegrated approaches that are currently failing to provide holistic so-
lutions to our water and integrated resource needs.

It  is  vital  for  the  U.S.  to  return  to  earlier  patterns  of  investment  in  water  infra-
structure-related research. Our nation is clearly falling behind in the efficiency and
effectiveness  of  its  approaches  relative  to  those  of  other  countries.  Research  invest-
ments  will  be  paid  back  in  many  ways,  including  reductions  in  costs  of  safe  and
clean  water  systems,  revitalized  local  economies  and  community  development,  and
in  new  economic  opportunities  for  American  businesses  in  designing  and  manufac-
turing solutions for emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere.

Conclusion

Throughout  the  second  half  of  the  20th  century  the  U.S.  led  the  world  in  devel-
oping  and  implementing  revolutionary  water  management  systems.  This  occurred
because of national need but was enabled by consistent federal funding for research
that built the strongest network of researchers and educators in the world. Observ-
ing the success of this approach, other countries such as Japan, the UK, and France
emulated this approach in the latter portion of the 20th century, with great success.
This approach continues today, especially in a variety of Asian countries which have
the  same  compelling  national  need  as  us  and  who  see  that  federal  investments  in
water  R&D  are  a  great  public  investment  which  returns  itself  many  times  over  by
both meeting critical national needs but also be creating profitable national and ex-
port businesses.

The  question  before  is  us  whether  the  U.S.  is  going  to  give  up  its  leadership  in
this critical area and fail to live up to its potential to dramatically improve the qual-
ity  of  life  in  the  U.S.  and  around  the  world.  This  is  the  path  that  we  are  on,  but
it  can  be  reversed  with  a  fairly  modest  set  of  actions  by  the  Federal  Government,
including a substantial investment in R&D, that would be facilitated by this legisla-
tion.

Ms.  FURSTOSS.  Thank  you.  Chair  Gordon,  Mr.  Hall,  Members  of
the  Committee,  it  is  a  privilege  to  share  with  you  GE’s  thoughts
on the National Water Research and Development Initiative Act of
2009.  I  feel  that  this  Act  would  represent  a  very  positive  step  for-
ward  in  strengthening  the  planning  and  implementation  of  water
research  and  development  across  the  Nation.  The  Federal  Govern-
ment’s  role  in  providing  structure  and  oversight  will  help  accel-
erate new developments in a more coordinated way.

If  we  truly  want  to  change  how  our  nation  thinks  about  water,
Chair  Gordon,  as  you  so  eloquently  put  it,  sound  resource  water
management, it is going to take a community. This is a community

of  government,  National  labs,  academia,  institutes,  and  industry
working together in unison with prioritization, with common goals,
with  the  ability  to  determine  which  technologies  will  be  able  to  be
implemented, what will be supported, and if can we work together.
Companies  like  GE  are  investing  in  technology  development  for
water re-use, water conservation, and water purification. But when
you have a community that is both strong in cultivating and devel-
oping  new  ideas,  and  equally  effective  in  achieving  the  end  result,
success is sure, is bound to be a sure thing.

Giving  industry  the  opportunity  to  work  with  academia,  to  work
with institutes in a coordinated way will surely further this initia-
tive.  I  was  very  excited  when  I  read  in  the  bill  some  of  the
prioritization areas, including the water census, including very im-
portantly  standards  and  methods  of  measuring  water  purification,
an  area  which  I  feel  has  been  ignored  as  we  continue  to  legislate,
as we continue to drive more and more companies, rightfully so, to
re-use water, to cleanse water. It is very important that we under-
stand how to measure, how to achieve the levels that we are asking
for.

GE  is  currently  working  on  a  number  of  different  areas.  For  ex-
amples,  our  scientists  and  engineers  are  partnered  with  the  De-
partment of Energy to develop new technology for the treatment of
impaired waters for industrial cooling applications, thus being able
to use more waters in a sound way. The goal is to minimize water
discharge and enhance water re-use.

We are also working with the Department of Energy to optimize
a  system  for  waste  water  treatment,  which  would  help  to  reduce
the cost of energy for systems run by municipalities and industries.
Ultimately,  it  is  going  to  come  down  to  how  these  technologies
are  deployed.  Are  they  meeting  the  proper  regulatory  require-
ments?  Do  they  measure  impurities  in  a  way  that  ensures  water
is safe? Are they minimizing energy usage so that industry can de-
ploy  these  technologies  in  a  cost-effective,  environmentally-friendly
way?

This last question is especially important. One of the biggest im-
pediments  to  deploying  new  clean  water  technologies  is  the  high
cost  of  energy.  This  bill  will  go  a  tremendous  way  in  helping  to
focus the community on those sorts of questions and answers.

In closing, it makes sense to have a fully-coordinated strategy for
addressing  our  nation’s  clean  water  needs,  and  this  will  require
more direct involvement from the government as well as industries
such  as  GE  and  our  competitors.  There  are  robust  R&D  pipelines,
but  there  can  be  more.  There  is  not  a  lack  of  ideas  for  cleaning
water.  It  is  helping  to  prioritize  them  and  determine  how  can  we
help  the  universities,  the  small  companies,  or  the  large  companies
like mine to get them into the marketplace in a way that is reliable
and sustainable.

Working  together  with  the  government  and  other  key  stake-
holders  we  will  have  the  community  we  need  to  successfully  carry
out  a  National  Clean  Water  Research  and  Development  Initiative.
Chair  Gordon,  Mr.  Hall,  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you

for the time and the opportunity to provide our comments.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHRISTINE FURSTOSS

Introduction

Chairman  Gordon  and  Ranking  Member  Hall  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  it
is  privilege  to  share  with  you  GE’s  thoughts  on  the  ‘‘National  Water  Research  and
Development Initiative Act of 2009.’’

Background

GE  is  a  diversified  global  infrastructure,  finance  and  media  company  that  pro-
vides  a  wide  array  of  products  to  meet  the  world’s  essential  needs.  From  energy,
water,  and  transportation  to  health  care  and  security,  we  deliver  advanced  tech-
nology  solutions  through  a  broad  business  portfolio  to  promote  cleaner,  more  effi-
cient  energy  alternatives,  increase  the  availability  of  clean,  safe  water,  improve  ac-
cess  to  quality  health  care  and  enhance  the  safety  and  security  of  the  public  at-
large.

As  General  Manager  of  Technology  for  GE  Water  &  Process  Technologies  in
Trevose, Pennsylvania, and as a former senior technology leader at GE’s Global Re-
search  Center  in  Upstate  New  York,  I  know  first-hand  the  considerable  stake  and
investment that GE has in clean water research and development.

GE  Water  and  Process  Technologies  is  a  leading  global  supplier  of  water  treat-
ment, wastewater treatment and process systems solutions. Our treatment systems
provide  clean,  safe  drinking  water  to  millions  of  people  in  water-scarce  regions
around  the  world.  They  also  are  a  critical  resource  for  helping  industries  minimize
water usage in support of their operations.

GE’s Global Research Center, located outside of Albany, is one of the world’s larg-
est  and  most  diversified  industrial  research  labs  and  the  first  to  be  established  in
the U.S.

From  the  light  bulb,  medical  x-ray  and  the  first  U.S.  jet  engine  to  more  recent
product  breakthroughs  such  as  digital  x-ray,  the  GE–90  and  GEnx  aircraft  engines
and  the  best  in-class  Evolution  Locomotive,  the  Center  has  a  long  and  proud  herit-
age  of  developing  the  breakthrough  technologies  that  enabled  these  revolutionary
products to be introduced into the marketplace.

Today,  the  Center  has  a  world-class  team  of  scientists  and  engineers  working  on
the next generation of technology solutions to make water more accessible and more
affordable.  From  reducing  the  cost  of  desalinated  water  to  tap  abundant  saltwater
resources to maximizing our ability to treat and re-use wastewater, we believe that
technology holds the key to successfully addressing an increasing water scarcity epi-
demic.

Congressman Gordon, we applaud your efforts to establish a national initiative fo-
cused on clean water and research development. It could not come at a more critical
time for our nation and for the world. According the United Nations, 2.8 billion peo-
ple  around  the  world  already  live  in  water  stressed  regions.  By  2025,  this  number
is  expected  to  nearly  double  to  5.3  billion—more  than  two-thirds  of  what  the  fore-
casted population will be at that time.

With shifts in population and our existing water resources being constrained, the
U.S.  is  feeling  this  impact  as  well.  In  the  southwest  U.S.,  freshwater  aquifers  have
been  depleting  at  a  time  when  population  in  the  region  has  been  growing.  In  New
England,  groundwater  contamination  is  a  growing  issue.  At  the  Colorado  River
Basin,  competition  for  water  access  has  become  a  real  source  of  political  and  eco-
nomic  tensions.  Also,  Washington  D.C.’s  drinking  water  supplies  continue  to  be
threatened by lead and other contaminants.

Comments and Recommendations

‘‘The National Water Research and Development Initiative Act of 2009’’ would rep-
resent  a  positive  step  forward  to  strengthen  the  planning  and  implementation  of
water  research  and  development  across  the  Nation.  The  Federal  Government’s  role
in  providing  structure  and  oversight  will  help  accelerate  new  developments  in  a
more coordinated way. But beyond structure, we believe the bill should be more in-
clusive  to  ensure  that  industry  has  an  equal  seat  at  the  table  with  the  other  key
stakeholders.

If we want to truly change how our nation thinks about water, it is going to take
a  community  of  government,  the  National  labs,  academia  and  industry  working  to-
gether in unison.

Companies like GE are on the front lines of the water scarcity epidemic. We have
a keen understanding of where the water stressed areas are located and the unique
challenges  each  faces.  Most  importantly,  we  have  product  solutions  in  the  market

today  and  advanced  technologies  in  the  pipeline  for  tomorrow  to  address  our  na-
tion’s water problems.

We  understand  how  to  industrialize  research.  It’s  part  of  our  livelihood  to  take
new  technologies  and  find  ways  to  commercialize  them  in  the  marketplace  where
they can add value and solve problems for our customers.

When  you  have  a  community  that  is  both  strong  in  cultivating  and  developing
new  ideas  and  equally  effective  in  achieving  an  end-result,  success  will  be  a  sure
thing.  Giving  industry  an  equal  seat  at  the  table  will  ensure  that  promising  ideas
translate into real commercial product solutions.

GE  knows  first-hand  the  value  that  can  be  added  when  you  have  a  community
of  government,  industry,  academia  and  other  stakeholders  all  working  together.  It
is  a  key  foundation  of  our  ecomagination  initiative.  Ecomagination,  first  launched
in  May  of  2005,  represents  GE’s  commitment  to  drive  the  development  of  green
products  and  technologies  to  solve  the  world’s  toughest  environmental  challenges.
As  part  of  this  commitment,  GE  is  doubling  its  level  of  investment  in  clean  re-
search and development from $700 million in 2005 to more than $1.5 billion by the
year  2010.  Since  ecomagination  was  first  launched,  we  have  increased  the  number
of  green  products  from  17  to  more  than  60  products  today.  GE’s  success  has  been
due, in large part, in our ability to coordinate with government, with our customers
and with other industry partners to promote key technology developments.

Included  within  our  portfolio  of  ecomagination  products  are  a  dozen  products  re-
lated  to  water  treatment  and  purification.  And  we  have  new  technologies  in  desali-
nation, wastewater treatment, water re-use and advanced membranes at GE’s Glob-
al Research Center to promote new clean water developments for the future.

In  fact,  we  are  currently  working  with  the  Federal  Government  and  other  part-
ners  on  various  clean  water  projects.  For  example,  scientists  and  engineers  at  GE
Global  Research  are  partnering  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  on  a
project  to  develop  new  technologies  for  the  treatment  of  impaired  water  for  indus-
trial  cooling  applications.  The  goal  is  minimize  water  discharge  and  enhance  water
re-use.  We  also  are  working  with  the  DOE  to  optimize  a  system  for  wastewater
treatment,  which  would  help  reduce  the  cost  of  energy  for  systems  run  by  munici-
palities and various industries.

Encouraging more water re-use through the treatment of impaired water and im-
provements to wastewater treatment systems are great examples of how we are de-
veloping  new  and  better  ways  to  clean  water.  Beyond  what  industries  like  GE  are
doing, we also are seeing innovative technology being developed by our universities
and National labs to maximize the use of our precious water resources.

Ultimately,  it  will  come  down  to  how  these  technologies  get  deployed.  Are  they
meeting  the  proper  regulatory  requirements?  Do  they  measure  for  impurities  in  a
way that ensures water is safe? Are they minimizing energy usage, so that industry
can deploy these technologies in a cost-effective, environmentally friendly way? This
last  question  is  especially  important.  One  of  the  biggest  impediments  to  deploying
new  clean  water  technologies  is  the  high  cost  of  energy.  With  GE’s  experience  in
designing  systems,  developing  technologies  and  optimizing  systems  for  minimized
energy usage, this last goal is well within our reach. Again, that is why it will take
a community.

In closing, it makes sense that having a fully coordinated strategy for addressing
our nation’s clean water needs will require more direct involvement from private in-
dustries  like  GE.  We  have  a  robust  R&D  pipeline  and  a  direct  path  to  market  for
new solutions. Working together with Federal Government and the other key stake-
holders,  we  will  have  the  community  we  need  to  successfully  carry  out  a  national
clean water research and development initiative.

Chairman  Gordon  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  your  time  and

the opportunity to provide our comments and recommendations on this bill.

DISCUSSION

Chair  GORDON.  Thank  you  and  for  all  our  panelists  for  being

here.

Now, at this point we will open our first round of questions. The

Chair recognizes himself for five minutes.

Dr.  Vaux,  in  your  testimony  you  indicated  that  the  importance
of  obtaining  and  managing  and  exchanging  data  on  water  re-
sources, in addition to my bill H.R. 1145, there is legislation pend-
ing  in  the  House,  S.  22,  that  authorizes  additional  funds  for  the
USGS  Stream  Flow  Network  and  for  expanded  monitoring  of
ground  water  resources.  It  seems  to  me  that  the  coordination  of
agencies’  efforts  directed  by  H.R.  1145  and  the  expansion  of  these
two key data resources and S. 22 are complimentary.

Would  you  like  to  make  a  comment  on  that  by  virtue  of  the  re-

search you have already done?

Dr. VAUX. Well, I would agree that they are complimentary, and
I  would  agree  that  they  ought  to  go  forward  in  a  fashion  that  is
coordinated  again  and  not  independently  so.  The  U.S.  Geological
Survey is the agency with the most experience in terms of data col-
lection, data management, and making the data available to users.
And  one  regrettable  characteristic  of  our  data  acquisition  pro-
gram  is  that  there  has  been  a  significant  disinvestment  in  it  over
the  last  two  decades.  These  bills  with  appropriate  authorizations
and  follow-on  funding  would  go  some  ways  toward  rectifying  that
disinvestment by investing further. My only concern is that it does
not proceed independently of what you are trying to do, Mr. Chair.
Chair GORDON. Thank you, Dr. Vaux. Mr. Baird or Dr. Baird will
be  very  happy  to  know  that  you  wanted  to  include  the  social
sciences and the various categories.

And  you  had  also  mentioned  additional  funding  for  the  coordi-

nating agency. What are you envisioning there?

Dr. VAUX. An off-the-wall estimate would be simply $2 or $3 mil-
lion  annually  to  support  the  efforts  of  the  coordination  effort.  My
experience has been or my observation has been when you ask the
agencies to take the costs of these kinds of coordination efforts out
of  existing  funds,  they  lack  enthusiasm,  and  I  think  by  providing
a little money one would generate more enthusiasm to achieve the
goals  and  objectives  of  the  bill.  And  also  there  may  be  a  need  to
provide  some  additional  research  money  along  the  lines  that  Dr.
Gleick suggested.

Chair GORDON. Thank you. That is very good advice.
And  Mr.  Modzelewski,  you  had  mentioned  that  30  to  50  percent
savings  could  be  made  in  water  consumption  by  using  IT.  That  is
a pretty extraordinary number. Can you go through that a little bit
more with us?

Mr. MODZELEWSKI. Sure.
Chair GORDON. Some examples.

Mr.  MODZELEWSKI.  Sure.  And  some  said  it  is  more,  some  cer-
tainly  said  it  is  less,  but  that  tends  to  be  the  range.  Really  right
now there is not really a common understanding of how to commu-
nicate water, communicate about water. Having a sensors’ network
that  would  be  able  to  give  us  far  more  in-depth  understanding  of
the usage, matched against something like a census would allow us
to  know  how  much  we  are  using,  how  much  we  are  wasting,  and
to be able to address those problems quickly.

You  have  the  issues  right  now  with  say,  a  city  like  Chicago,
where some of the estimates are that Chicago is losing as much as
60  percent  of  its  water  before  it  gets  to  the  faucet.  If  you  look  at
a  situation  like  that  where  you  had  a  smart  network  and  smart
grid  in  place,  you  would  be  able  to  assess  where  you  are  losing  it,
what the cost benefit analysis is of doing that, and address it. Not
to mention usage that is going through streams as it is being used
in finding beneficial uses along those lines.

Right now from an IT perspective we don’t, again, have common
standards.  Often  where  we  are  doing  readings  we  have  different
systems  doing  different  readings  but  yet  in  the  exact  same  place.
You  can  find  a  box  in  a  stream  that  maybe  five  communities  have
put  together  various  water  monitoring  and  analysis  systems  in-
stead  of  sharing  that  data.  And  the  ability  to  potentially  overlay  a
smart system where we know where it is, be able to speak to each
other  about  it,  and  be  able  to  assess  how  much  damage  is  being
done,  how  much  we  are  losing,  and  to  be  able  to  address  those  at
a  pinpoint  fashion  would  come  from  an  IT  system  or,  again,  using
a term that has become fanciful right now, a smart-water grid, that
overlays.

Chair GORDON. All right. So are you talking about implementing

existing technology, or haven’t you developed new technology?

Mr.  MODZELEWSKI.  It  wouldn’t  really  need  a  huge  jump  from
technology  we  currently  have  available.  It  would  certainly  be  a
need to be adapted to a water system, and everyone would have to
agree upon the measurements and what all the wording means and
what  all  the  reporting  would  mean  within  it.  But  there  is  nothing
about  the  actual  code,  if  you  will,  the  actual  writing  of  this  that
would  be  new.  The  only  other  thing  that  would  be  new  is  actually
probably  a  far  more  intensive  sensor  network  to  be,  actually  take
readings far more aggressively throughout a system.

Chair GORDON. Ms. Furstoss, since you have come out of this di-

vision, do you have a comment on that?

Ms.  FURSTOSS.  The  idea  of  a  smart  water  grid,  the  idea  of  being
able to implement I think is a wonderful idea. It does provide chal-
lenges  as  was  mentioned  in  the  sensor  technology  and  being  able
to have reliable data. I think the data management techniques, the
ability to measure for water usage is there. The ability to easily im-
plement it, I think, will take a much more-coordinated effort.

Again,  as  was  mentioned,  how  is  it  measured,  how  often,  the
standards,  but  I  do  think  that  the  ability  to  measure  water  usage,
the technologies do exist.

Chair GORDON. My time has expired.
Mr. Hall, you are recognized for five minutes.
Mr.  HALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair.  Mr.  Modzelewski,  I  appreciate
your  concern  for  amounts  of  money  because  that  is  something  we

that.

have  to  take  into  consideration  and  would  pass  any  bill.  And  it  is
kind  of  extraordinary  for  folks  like  you  to  come  here  that  are  that
considerate of our problems.

You  know,  we  have  a  present  President  that  is  throwing  money
like  mad,  the  stimulus,  and  the  President  and  my  friend  that  just
left  us  is  back  in  Dallas  right  now  with  his  bailouts,  you  know,
bailed  $700  or  $800  billion  and  $350  billion  of  it  just  went  com-
pletely quickly, and where it went we don’t know or what happened
to  it,  and  all  they  said  was  uh-oh,  and  we  don’t  know,  you  know,
about that.

So  I  thank  you  for  being  that  considerate.  I  wanted  to  just  say

But  my  question  is  to  Mrs.  Furstoss.  Legislation  was  introduced
and  passed  in  the  House,  this  Congress  and  last  Congress,  to  ex-
plore  ways  to  utilize  and  maybe  treat  the  water  produced  from
drilling for oil. That is a big problem for us, and we have some leg-
islation. The Chair and this entire committee helped us pass those
bills, knowing the importance of them.

Has GE done any research in this area?
Ms.  FURSTOSS.  Yes.  We  have  done  research  and  are  continuing
at the moment to do research looking at produced waters from the
oil  industry.  We  are  working  with,  in  addition  to  our  research  and
development  center,  we  are  working  very  closely  with  some  of  the
oil-producing  companies  to  understand  how  we  can  purify  the  wa-
ters that are being drawn, the oily waters. Very difficult technology
because of the temperatures that the waters are at, because of the
consistency  when  the  oil  comes  out  of  the  ground  with  the  water
or  the  water  that  is  used  to  help  promote  the  drilling  and  really
bringing up the oil.

These  waters  are  very  oily.  They  have  a  significant  amount  of
solids,  they  have  a  significant  amount  of  contamination.  Anything
that  could  be  in  the  ground  is  going  to  come  up  with  the  waters.
Mr. HALL. Would you feel like they are worth the cleansing proc-

ess?

Ms.  FURSTOSS.  I  think  that  for  sustainability  we  need  to.  We
need  to  figure  out  how  can  we  clean  these  waters  to  be  able  to  re-
duce the water usage, to be able to re-use them, but currently with
the  oil  content  it  is  very  difficult.  It  is  one  of  our  main  area  of  re-
search right now within GE water and process technology.

Mr. HALL. None of these waters have been cleaned enough to get

to the faucet.

Ms. FURSTOSS. Not to get to the——
Mr. HALL. One of the——
Ms.  FURSTOSS.  Yes.  Not  to  get  to  the  faucet  to  my  knowledge.
Perhaps  in  some  isolated  areas  they  are.  Again,  we  are  focusing
also on being able to re-use these waters, again, so these operations
require much less water usage.

Mr.  HALL.  So  they  are  generally  relegated  to  re-use  in  the  oil

Ms. FURSTOSS. Yes.
Mr. HALL. I thank you. I yield back.
Chair  GORDON.  Mr.  Miller,  I  don’t  see  you.  Oh.  Okay.  I  didn’t
see—okay.  All  right.  Okay.  Ms.  Fudge  is  recognized  for  five  min-

Ms. FUDGE. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I  am  from  Cleveland,  Ohio,  so  I  live  on  one  of  the  Great  Lakes,
Lake  Erie.  We  don’t  have  a  problem  with  access  to  water.  What  I
would  like  to  know,  and  any  of  the  panelists  might  answer  the
question for me or a number of you, but as you talk about the need
to,  for  the  Federal  Government  to  provide  more  money  towards
water research and you talk about the smart grids and how we de-
termine  how  much  water  we  actually  use,  if  we  provide  these  re-
sources  and  do  this  research,  how  do  we  then  keep  the  cost  of
water usage down? Because in our area where we really don’t have
any problem with access to water, our water rates are going up sig-
nificantly. I don’t know if it is the technology to read meters. I am
not  sure  about  that,  but  could  you  just  give  me  your  thoughts  on
what  we  could  do  over  time  with  the  research  to  reduce  the  cost
of providing clean water?

Dr. VAUX. I will take a first cut at that. I am an economist, and
the pricing of water is near and dear to my heart, and I think that
the  bad  news  from  the  point  of  view  of  your  constituents  is  that
the price of water is likely to rise in the coming decades, and there
is virtually nothing that can be done to make it go down. What can
be done is research that will attenuate the rate of increase.

Water  is  now  and  has  historically  been  under-priced,  and  one  of
the things that is going to happen as scarcity intensifies is that the
price will rise. The price will also rise because the cost of securing
a  clean  water  supply  that  is  safe  and  healthful  will  also  rise.  And
I  think  the  fact  of  the  matter  is  that  the  citizens  of  the  United
States have enjoyed a healthful water supply for over 200 years at
less than full cost, and that the reasonable expectation ought to be
on the part of citizens that costs more nearly approaching the true
cost of water are going to have to be paid in the future.

I am sorry I can’t be more optimistic.
Dr.  GLEICK.  If  I  could  add  two  points  to  that.  One  is  the  costs
are  likely  to  go  up  in  addition  because  we  expect  we  are  going  to
have  to  spend  more  money  to  provide  clean  water.  That  is  a  ques-
tion  of  reliability,  it  is  a  question  of  availability,  and  it  is  a  ques-
tion of quality. There are new contaminants that we don’t regulate
for. There are new contaminants that we don’t remove, and we are
going to have to develop technology and apply technology to remove
them. And that is going to cost more.

On  the  other  side,  though,  and  some  of  the  other  speakers  have
mentioned  this,  there  is  a  lot  of  effort  going  into  figuring  out  how
to  use  water  more  efficiency.  We  actually  use  less  water  in  the
United States today for everything than we used 20 years ago. We
are  becoming  more  efficient,  and  as  we  become  more  efficient,  ei-
ther  in  the  home,  through  better  appliances,  or  in  industries  with
better  processes,  the  cost  of  water  can  do  down,  the  total  cost  of
water can go down.

So we have to match this growing cost for improved reliability of
supply and improved quality with the potential to improve the effi-
ciency and reduce our overall demand for water.

Chair  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Ms.  Fudge,  and  Mr.  Rohrabacher,

you are recognized for five minutes.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and appre-
ciate  you  holding  this  hearing.  I  come  from  southern  California,

and we know how important water is. I am very proud to say that
my  own  county,  Orange  County,  is  on  the  cutting  edge  of  techno-
logical  development,  especially  in  reclamation  of  water  and  con-
servation of water, and I have been very supportive of those efforts
with  earmarks  for  my  district.  I  just  wanted  to  make  sure  people
got that.

And  we  also  have  supported,  I  have  also  supported  efforts  there
to  make  sure  that  we  have  the  reporting  of  the  purity  of  the—or
not  the  purity  but  the  safety  of  the  water  which  the  surfers  surf
in and people have their children swimming in. So I am very proud
of our local area.

Let  me  note,  however,  just  a  little  slight  disagreement.  We  have
not had 200 years of water safety in our country. Water was really
in  bad  condition  up  until  about  50  years  ago.  I  remember  when  I
was  young  they  wouldn’t  let  me  put  my  finger  in  the  Potomac  be-
cause my fingernails would fall out, and I remember that song back
when  I  was  younger,  maybe  some  of  my  colleagues  remember  this
song.  My  fellow—or  colleague  from  Cleveland  may  be  too  young  to
remember this, but it was, ‘‘burn on big river, burn on.’’ And so we
have  a  lot  to  be  proud  of  in  terms  of  what  we  have  accomplished
for water, and I would support the idea of a water census to make
sure  that  we  understand  the  overall  goals  that  we  should  have  as
a country, as well as standards for purity.

I  would  like  to  ask  a  little  bit  about  some  of  these  other  things.

We do have limited resources, and I think

Mr.—and I am—how do you pronounce your name?
Mr. MODZELEWSKI. Modzelewski.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Modzelewski.  Did  make  a  point  that  maybe
perhaps investment in technology might be better than just putting
more  money  into  research.  And  if  you  could  do  new  technologies,
for example, if we could make water desalinization a little more ef-
ficient.  We  do  have  problems  in  the,  in  our  area  with  water  desa-
linization  being  opposed  by  environmentalists  because  the  little
fishes  might  be  trapped  and  then  the  pelican  might  not  be  able  to
eat  the  meal  that  day  or  something  like  that.  We  have  to  balance
those  considerations  off;  pure  water  versus  the  pelican  getting  his
meal.

But  with  that  observation  could  you  give  me  a  little  bit  about
this?  Where  would  you  put,  rather  than  just  research  into  water,
where  would  you  put  the  money  that  would  actually  start  making
things better? What technologies would you focus on?

Mr.  MODZELEWSKI.  Well,  rather  than  necessarily  getting  highly
specific on that, what we tend to be doing right now if you look at
it  is  the  technology  portfolio  as  we  tend  to  figure  out  tweaks.  We
tend to figure out how to make a little bit better membrane, a little
bit better type of filtration.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Yes.
Mr.  MODZELEWSKI.  A  chemical  that  might  not  be  as  hazardous
or  a  means  of  cutting  out  something  in  the  system,  and  it  is  very
bizarre  compared  to  other  areas  of  technology  where  you  look  at  a
wide  range  of  things.  Look  at  energy,  for  instance,  where  it  is  ev-
erything from improving how we handle oil to doing something like
focusing  solar  cells  to  work  better  and  that  kind  of  thing.  And  we
really don’t have that in water.

There  are  very  few  research  efforts  that  are  being  done  on  mid
to  long-range,  and  that  ranges  from  more  efficient  desalinization,
which  right  now  there  is  actually  a  new  research  effort  at  Yale  on
something  called  forward  osmosis,  which  would  be  less  energy  in-
tensive  than  reverse  osmosis.  There  is  a  researcher  out  of  Duke
University  who  is  actually  using  biotech  techniques  for  purifying
water so you don’t have to use chemicals, and she is actually using
RNAI to actually turn off the bacteria and pathogens in water rath-
er  than  having  to  put  chemical  treatments  in  it  that  would  harm,
be harmful and need other treatments and other energy and other
usages to get them out.

A lot of the times what we are doing in water is we are actually
putting  bad  things  in.  It  is  sort  of  like  chemotherapy.  You  are
using  something  horrible  to  try  and  kill  the  disease  quicker  than
the treatment kills you.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, let me note we also not only have to de-
velop  the  technology,  we  have  to  provide  our  businesses  with  the
incentive to actually utilize that. I visited a plant just two days ago
in southern California where the owner of this very small company,
you  know,  it  was  a  medium-sized  company,  had  invested  $800,000
in  a  piece  of  equipment  that  purified  the  water  before  it  went  into
the, you know, from the plant before it went into the system. That
was  $800,000,  but  the  depreciation  schedule  on  that  was  the  same
for anything else. And we have a depreciation schedule in our coun-
try  that  puts  us  at  a  disadvantage  compared  to  the  Japanese  and
others.

Perhaps,  Mr.  Chair,  we  could  support  legislation  that  would  say
that  for  water  or  other  environmental  technologies  that  we  can
agree  upon,  that  the  depreciation  schedule  for  the  actual  putting
of  that  technology  into  practice  at  businesses,  that  we  would  have
an  advanced  or  a  shorter  depreciation  schedule  than  just  for  other
technologies. That might work very well, and thank you very much
for this hearing.

And  if  I  could  maybe  ask  on  last  question,  maybe  our  last  wit-
ness would like to answer the question about what technologies we
should most focus on.

Ms. FURSTOSS. Thank you for the opportunity. I think that there
are a number of technologies if we step back and per your last com-
ment,  look  at  the  system  level  and  understand  the  total  cost  to
treat  of  water.  There  is  amazing  work  going  on  at  institutes,  Na-
tional  labs,  universities.  I  am  very  aware  of  some  of  the  work  in
forward osmosis and so forth.

But I think also we need to step back and say how can we drive
down  the  total  energy  need  for  water  purification.  There  has  been
very  minimal  investment  in  energy  recovery  devices,  in  devices  to
look  at  how  can  we  get  more  water  through  with  less  energy,
whether it be pumps, whether it be devices that can take the pres-
sure differential and turn that into energy, or whether it be totally
new  materials  that  allow  the  membranes  to  work  in  a  totally  dif-
ferent way.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Thank  you  very  much,  and  let  me  note,
again,  with  an  earmark  I  provided  funds  for  Long  Beach  Water
District to develop a new system that is 25 percent more energy ef-
ficient.

Chair  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Rohrabacher.  You  can  be  on  our

46

next panel.

And Ms. Edwards is recognized.
Ms.  EDWARDS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair,  and  thanks  to  the  panel-
ists.  It  is  really  good  to  see  Peter  Gleick.  I  have  read  every  one  of
your bi-annual water reports, so I appreciate meeting you.

About 25 years ago I spent some time at the World Bank, really
working on tracking the big infrastructure, you know, projects, the
dam projects, et cetera, that the bank was funding at the time, pur-
portedly to make sure that we had a world that had a clean water
supply. And I don’t think we are any closer to a clean water supply
now  with  the  expenditure  of  billions  and  billions  of  dollars  across
the country.

One  of  the  questions  that  I  have  for  you  and  perhaps  from  Ms.
Stoner  as  well,  is  to,  is  about  what  we  might  do  in  our  own  re-
search assessment here in the United States that takes into consid-
eration  what  the  impact  in  the  world’s  water  supply  is  and  strate-
gies for addressing the world’s water supply.

And  I  think  Dr.  Gleick,  as  you  pointed  out  a  number  of  times,
you  know,  the  connection  between  security  and  water  supply  is
really,  it  is  deep.  We  are  seeing  that  right  here  in  our  own  hemi-
sphere,  and  so  I  wonder  if  you  might  address  ways  that  we  can
make  investments  in  research  that  look  at  things  like  global,  like
climate  change  and  its  impact  on  water  and  the  relationship  be-
tween  neighboring  states,  and  our  use  of  water,  and  if  there  may
be  things  that  we  could  explore  in  terms  of  strategies  here  in  the
United  States  that  could  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  world’s
water supply.

Dr. GLEICK. Congresswoman, thank you very much for that ques-
tion.  It  is  a  huge  question.  I  don’t  expect  to  be  able  to  answer  it
fully.

It  is  long  past  time  that  the  U.S.  reevaluated  not  just  our  own
national  water  policy  but  our  national  water  policy  in  the  context
of  international  water  issues.  We  have  enormous  resources  here,
intellectual  resources,  technological  resources,  financial  resources,
even  given  the  current  financial  crisis,  to  help  address  the  billion
people  worldwide  that  don’t  have  access  to  safe  drinking  water.  I
think there is a lot that can be done.

In  my  written  testimony  I  recommended  expanding  perhaps  not
this  particular  bill  but  certainly  bills  in  Congress  to  address  how
the  U.S.  spends  its  money  and  its  resources  and  its  efforts  at  the
international level as well. I think it is time for, it is past time for
reassessment,  and  the  good  will  that  we  could  generate  inter-
nationally with those resources is enormous.

I am not sure it necessarily requires new technology as much as
it may require doing more of what we do here in the United States
in  other  places;  rethinking  how  we  give  foreign  aid.  Instead  of
spending  $1  billion  at  the  World  Bank  on  a  water  project,  the
World  Bank  and  other  agencies  need  to  think  about  how  to  spend
$1,000  in  a  million  places.  In  many  parts  of  the  world  $1,000  can
be enormously effective at bringing clean water to schools, bringing
hygiene  education  programs,  a  whole  set  of  things  that  we  really
know  how  to  do  in  order  to  solve  world  water  problems  but  just
haven’t done yet.

I would be happy to—I could go on and on about this but perhaps

another time.

Ms.  EDWARDS.  Thank  you,  and  Ms.  Stoner,  I  am  curious  as  well
if  you  could  both  address  this  and  the  relationship  between  what
we  are  doing  here  on  climate  change  and  how  that  impacts  what
is happening with our water and water supply and particularly the
management of it.

Ms.  STONER.  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  do  that.  With  re-
spect  to  your  first  question,  one  thing  that  occurs  to  me  is  the  de-
velopment  of  decentralized  waste  water  treatment  technologies.  In
lots  of  places,  other  countries,  they  don’t  have  centralized  sewer
systems and many, that is why many of the people don’t have ade-
quate  sanitation,  and  that  is,  you  know,  why  so  many  people  die
from drinking polluted water overseas.

And we also about a third of the new buildings, new homes built
in  the  United  States  actually  use  decentralized  waste  water  treat-
ment  technologies,  and  there  are  lots  of  benefits  to  doing  that  in
terms  of  hydrology  and  so  forth,  but  often  those  technologies  are
not sufficiently advanced to address the full range of water quality
issues. For example, nutrient pollution.

And  so  if  we  were  to  develop  those  technologies  better  in  the
United  States,  we  would  have  markets  overseas  that  we  could  use
those  for.  So  we  could  sort  of  take  advantage  of  the  fact  that  they
are looking at those technologies as a resource for them as well. So
that  would  be  one  idea  and  an  area  that  I  would  like  to  see  re-
search  into  advanced  decentralized  waste  water  treatment  tech-
nologies in the U.S.

As far as climate change goes, I think that we have a lot of good
information  on  impacts  of  climate  change  on  water  resources  that
I  referenced  in  my  technology,  in  my  testimony,  but  a  lot  of  it  is
at  a  global  level.  The  models  are  not  particularly  precise  as  they
bring  it  down  to  the  community  level  where  decisions  need  to  be
made about infrastructure investments and so forth. So that is one
area.

A  second  area  would  be  in  how  to  adapt  to  those  changes,  how
to  have  more  resilient  water  resources  in  the  face  of  climate
change. That is a new area of research that I would urge us to in-
vest in.

Chair GORDON. Ms. Stoner, if you don’t mind, we will let you pro-
vide  the  rest  of  that  for  the  record,  because  we  have  a  lot  of  folks
here, and we would like to try to get them through their questions
today, too.

Ms. STONER. I would be glad to do so.
Chair  GORDON.  I  will  be  neutrally  discourteous  to  everybody  as

we try to move a little bit faster.

Mr. Smith.
Mr.  SMITH.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair.  I’m  from  Nebraska  certainly
water  is  important  and  the  economics  of  water,  irrigation,  munic-
ipal and otherwise.

I know that there is huge costs with many things, but Dr. Vaux,
if you could elaborate when you say that the price of water has not
been  accurate  regarding  the  cost.  What  do  you  think  has  been  left
out?

Dr. VAUX. We talk about both urban users and agricultural users
who  typically  pay  the  cost  of  capturing,  transporting,  and  treating
the  water  but  not  the  scarcity  value  of  the  water.  In  other  words,
typically  in  the  United  States  the  scarcity  value  of  water  is  as-
signed  at  zero,  and  the  mistake  that  that  entails  is  that  it  signals
to  consumers  that  water  is  plentifully  available  when  all  of  us
know that it isn’t.

So  it  is  the  failure  of  our  water  pricing  structure  to  reflect  the

scarcity value which is what is missing.

Mr. SMITH. What value would you add to that?
Dr. VAUX. What would the scarcity value be? It would be very lo-
cation  specific.  Generally  speaking  what  our  studies  show  is  that
the scarcity value of water, of urban quality, would be higher than
the  scarcity  value  of  water  for  agriculture  because  it  has  to  be
treated  to  such  a  high  degree,  and  it  is,  therefore,  scarcer,  there-
fore, the price is higher.

Mr. SMITH. But is there a percentage that you would offer?
Dr. VAUX. No. I am very reluctant to generalize about it because
it  is  going  to  differ  as  between  Orange  County  and  New  Jersey  or
Orange  County  and  New  York  City.  I  am  very  reluctant  to  gener-
alize  because  I  think  it  is  going  to  be  a  different  value  depending
upon where you are.

Mr.  SMITH.  Okay.  Would  you  agree  that  many  advancements
have been made, for example, in irrigation techniques, no-till farm-
ing, and other efforts?

Dr. VAUX. Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, agriculture is as a gen-
eralization  a  more  efficient  user  of  water  today  than  it  was  a  dec-
ade ago or two decades ago, and I anticipate that it will become an
even  more  efficient  user  of  water  in  the  future  as  the  competition
increases  and  as  farmers  figure  out  ways  to  be  more  innovative
managers of water.

Mr. SMITH. I appreciate that. I concur with that. Just the obser-
vations, rather anecdotal on my part, I am very impressed with the
advancements  that  have  been  made  just  with  irrigation  practices
alone, not to mention other crop rotation and what have you.

So  I  appreciate  that.  I  am  encouraged  and  inspired  by  what  we
can  still  accomplish,  and  I  appreciate  your  efforts.  Thank  you.  I
yield back.

Chair GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Smith.
Mr. Tonko, I am not picking on you, but if there is no objections,
I would like for folks to try to maybe keep it to four minutes rather
than  five  minutes  so  that  we  can,  again,  try  to  let  everybody  have
a chance. So, Mr. Tonko, you are recognized.

Mr.  TONKO.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair.  I  am  sorry.  My  question  is

to Ms. Furstoss.

As one who represents Schenectady and a lot of GE activity, I am
interested in the fact that you mentioned being a leader, GE being
a  leading  supplier  for  water  treatment,  waste  water  treatment,
process  system  solutions.  Where  are  these  deliveries  being  made?
What  countries  are  we  reaching?  Is  it  spread  across  the  globe?  Is
there a concentration in a certain region?

Ms.  FURSTOSS.  It  truly  is  global.  We  have  a  significant  portion
of  our  sales,  and  I  apologize,  I  don’t  know  the  exact  number  but
can  provide  that,  in  North  America,  in  the  United  States,  specifi-

cally  in  the  central  region,  where  there  is  a  majority  of  heavy  in-
dustry, and we look to help them on water usage, to minimize their
water usage, to purify the waters that are used in everything from
steel  melting  to  plastic  injection  molding,  to  help  them  to  purify
those  waters  so  they  can  be  safety  discharged.  We  do  have  a  large
presence also in the Canadian areas, and we are global.

So  I  believe  that  the  majority  is  in  North  America,  but  I  would

have to be able to get you that exact figure.

Mr.  TONKO.  And  also  I  would  ask  like  I  believe  that  the  Presi-
dent and Congress recently with the passage of the Investment and
Recovery Act showed great wisdom in investing in pure R&D, clean
R&D.

Ms. FURSTOSS. Yes.
Mr. TONKO. Can you share with you, you doubled, I believe, more

than doubled in the last five years at GE——

Ms. FURSTOSS. We have more than——
Mr. TONKO.—investment.
Ms. FURSTOSS. Yeah. We have more than doubled our investment
in  what  we  use  as  the  phrase,  eco-imagination.  So  clean  tech-
nologies,  technologies  that  are  focused  at  energy  efficiency,  at
cleaner water. We have doubled that investment too, as a company
to over 1.5 billion, and we currently have over a dozen products in
that portfolio that are directly aimed at clean water.

Mr. TONKO. So in terms of the investment in R&D what percent-

age would water be? How—can you guess of the 1.5?

Ms.  FURSTOSS.  It  is  a  very  small  percentage  at  this  point.  I,
again, don’t know the exact number, but it is more on the order of
about 50 million.

Mr.  TONKO.  Would  you  happen  to  know  how  much  of  all  of  the

clean R&D is done here in the United States?

Ms.  FURSTOSS.  The  technology  development,  the  R&D  done  by
General  Electric  is  done,  the  vast  majority  in  the  United  States.
Well over three quarters.

Mr. TONKO. Thank you. Mr. Chair, I will yield back my time.
Chair GORDON. Thank you. And Mr. Inglis is recognized.
Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chair. We in South Carolina are be-
coming  more  and  more  acquainted  with  water  shortages  with  a
drought  and  before  that  we  had  been,  especially  in  the  lower  part
of  the  state,  starting  to  experience  some  salt  water  intrusion  into
the  aquifers  that  we  were  gathering  a  lot  of  water  for  places  like
Hilton  Head’s  development.  And  so  now  in  the  upstate  of  South
Carolina  we  are  becoming  more  and  more  aware  of  just  how  pre-
cious  the  resource  is,  in  part  because  Georgia  wants  water  out  of
the  Chattooga,  and  so  they  had  a  little  problem  down  in  Atlanta,
and  I  guess  that  is  why  they  want  more  water  out  of  the
Chattooga.

So  the  folks  at  the  Strom  Thurmond  Institute  at  Clemson  are
looking  at  preparing  a  water  budget  for  the  state,  and  I  wonder  if
you  might  comment  on  whether  this  bill  would,  that  we  are  dis-
cussing here today, would be helpful in that regard, or is it, is that
a  local  matter,  or  is  this  something  that  may  be  assisted  through
this bill?

Maybe  I  should  ask  the  Chair  about  that,  but  it  is  a  panel.  The
Chair  might  have  an  answer.  He  will  yield  himself  some  time

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:01 Aug 30, 2009 Jkt 047553 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\FULL09\030409\47553 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

50

maybe  to  answer  the  question,  but  anybody  on  the  panel  want  to
address  local  water  budgets  and  whether  those  might  be  assisted
by this bill?

Dr.  GLEICK.  I  will  be  happy  to  answer  quickly.  In  general  water
is  often  a  very  local  issue.  If  the  local  expertise  is  available  to
evaluate  the  hydrology,  to  look  at  the  resources  that  are  there,  to
look at water use, do it locally.

But  we  need  a  national  assessment  everywhere.  You  don’t,  you
are not the only ones with these kinds of problems. These kinds of
problems are coming up everywhere, even places we thought water
was  plentiful,  we  realized  it  no  longer  is.  And  so  we  need  a  com-
prehensive  assessment  of  water  use  and  water  availability  nation-
wide, which is what the census calls for.

The  other  problem  is  the  political  boundaries  we  have  rarely
match  the  hydrologic  boundaries  we  have.  We  have  watersheds
that permit conflicts to arise between Georgia, Alabama, and Flor-
ida, or Georgia and South Carolina, or Georgia and—I am not pick-
ing on Georgia. But the hydrologic boundaries we have and the po-
litical  boundaries  don’t  match.  And  that  is  another  reason  why  it
might be useful to get away from local assessments to national as-
sessments  that  really  do  these  kinds  of  things  at  the  watershed
boundary  so  we  understand  the  hydrology  and  then  perhaps  we
combine it with the politics.

Mr. INGLIS. Anyone else want to comment on that?
Mr. MODZELEWSKI. Actually I will just pick up on that. It is, one,
it  is  the  actual  bodies  of  water,  for  instance,  in  the  sense  of  a  wa-
tershed  that  you  have  to  look  at  something  like  an  aquifer  system
in  the  southwest.  It  tends  to  go  over  many  states  with  a  level  of
covenance between them, but they tend to have very different laws
on  how  that  is  operated  on.  You  have  a  riparian  system,  you  have
hybrid systems, et cetera, and what that really gets down to is each
state  that  is  drawing  from  the  water  has  a  very  different  idea  of
what appropriate use is and how to assign that use to people.

And  so  the  water,  as  the  water  moves  through  that  watershed
you  have  very  different  usage  levels,  very  different  sense  of  secu-
rity  in  the  sense  of  health  issues  and  things  along  those  lines.
Until a lot of that is understood or codified or standardized, you are
going to continue to have conflict as well.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Yeah.  I  suppose  one  of  the  outcomes  of  developing  a
budget  or  a  comprehensive  kind  of  approach  like  we  are  talking
about  here  would  be  mostly,  well,  one  of  the  key  outcomes  would
be  valuing  water  highly,  and  that  means  not  wasting  it.  Right?
Which  is  probably  what  all  of  us  do  a  lot.  So  that  will  be  one  of
the outcomes of this.

Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Chair GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Inglis. And there has been a cou-
ple  of  members  of  the  panel  that  have  suggested  universities
should  be  a  part  of  this,  and  we  will  look  at  that  if  we  could  do
it in some way.

Ms. Kosmas is recognized for five minutes or less.
Ms. KOSMAS. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think it will be less. I want
to  say  that  I  appreciate  the  panel’s  being  here  today  and  also  ap-
preciate this bill that you are moving forward.

I  wanted  to  ask  this  question  of  Ms.  Stoner.  You  stated  in  your
testimony  that  the  1972  Clean  Water  Act  authorized  $100  million
in  research  and  that  in  the  ’80s,  research  and  development  was
systematically  reduced  as  it  was  argued  that  the  private  sector
would  pick  up  the  slack.  In  fact,  in  ’84,  President  Reagan  stated
that  it  was  time  for  the  states  and  private  industry  to  take  over
the job.

So  my  question  would  be,  how  has  the  private  sector  fared  in

shouldering this burden without significant federal assistance?

Ms.  STONER.  Thank  you.  I  noticed  that  my  colleagues  had  some
different  estimates  in  terms  of  the  R&D  spending  over  the  time-
frame, so I don’t know if we had looked at different types of invest-
ments  or  not,  but  I  did  notice  that  they  indicated  that  they  also
thought  additional  investment  was  needed,  but  that  they  didn’t
think  that  the  absolute  number  had  decreased.  So  I  call  that  to
your attention.

You  know,  I  think  that  if  we  had  the  right  markets  and  could
help  particularly  bridge  the  gaps  through  a  federal  investment  be-
tween  the  development  of  the  technologies  and  their  implementa-
tion, I think that would help a lot to trigger private investment. So
the  social  science  research  that  we  mentioned  earlier  identifying
how to make the investment smarter on a watershed basis so that
every  dollar  is  expended  better  and  that  public  support  is  devel-
oped by showing what the value of the investments are.

I  think  that  the  needs  are  out  there,  so  what  we  need  to  do  is
to link up the needs with the development of the new technologies
and bridge those two.

Ms.  KOSMAS.  Okay.  Thank  you.  And  so  I  guess  the  bottom-line
question  is  do  you  think  that  additional  federal  funding  needs  to
be  placed  in  research  and  development,  or  do  you  think  then  that
the  private  sector  is  doing  its  share  to  bridge  the  gaps  that  you
have just described?

Ms.  STONER.  Well,  I  agree  with  my  colleague,  Dr.  Gleick,  that

there are things that are done better at the federal level.

Ms. KOSMAS. Yes.
Ms.  STONER.  Even  though  everyone  is  interested  in  their  own
local  water  body,  if  you  don’t  assess  how  things  can  be  done  on  a
watershed basis and look at a broad, from a broader scope, I think
you  miss  synergies  also,  looking  at  the  energy  water  nexus,  other
ways  of  evaluating  investments  in  water  that  can  also  help  with
energy,  climate  change,  even  air  pollution.  I  think  those  are  often
things that we miss that can help save money in the long run, pro-
vide better environmental benefits, and provide markets for indus-
try.

Ms.  KOSMAS.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  yield  back  my  time,  Mr.

Chair.

Chair GORDON. Thank you. Since Mr. Rohrabacher double-dipped

last time I am sure he would like to yield to Ms. Dahlkemper.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. I would be very happy to, and I apologize for
hogging that extra minute, knowing we are under a schedule prob-
lem.

Ms.  DAHLKEMPER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair,  and  thank  you,  Mr.
Rohrabacher.  I  appreciate  this  hearing  very  timely.  I,  like  Ms.
Fudge,  live  also  on  Lake  Erie.  I  am  just  a  little  bit  further  to  the

east in Pennsylvania. Abundance of water. Waste of water I would
say  for  many,  many  years.  My  neighbors  sometimes  clean  their
driveways  with  the  hose  for  over  half  an  hour,  and  they  will  leave
their  sprinklers  on  all  night  long.  So,  yeah,  we  see  a  Great  Lake
out  there,  and  people  don’t  think  about  the  impact  that  their  use
is having.

And so I guess what my question is when it comes to water use,
you  know,  what  segments  of  water  do  you  see  cause  the  most  con-
cern in terms of water use? How would population growth and mi-
gration impact such water use over time?

Of  course,  we  think  we  will  become  the  place  where  everyone
wants  to  live  eventually  because  we  have  water.  But—and  also  I
guess tied into that, what portion of the present use or the present
water  waste  could  be  resolved  by  reasonable  household  conserva-
tion?

And  so  I  guess  I  just  open  this  up  to  whoever  would  like  to  an-

swer.

Dr.  GLEICK.  Let  me  take  a  first  crack  at  that.  I  would  note  that
of all the people who are most concerned about your neighbors’ use
of  water  and  looking  out  over  the  Great  Lakes  are  probably  the
Canadians——

Ms. DAHLKEMPER. Yes.
Dr. GLEICK.—who worry quite a bit about that, and I know there
is  a  new  agreement  between  the  U.S.  and  the  Canadians  on  the
Great Lakes.

At  the  Pacific  Institute  we  have  done  a  lot  of  work  at,  on  this
question,  specifically  on  water  use  efficiency.  The  quick  answer  is
our estimate is that current urban use of water could easily be re-
duced  by  30  or  35  percent  from  today’s  level  with  existing  tech-
nology cost effectively. Better toilets, better washing machines, bet-
ter  dishwashers,  more  effective  and  efficient  outdoor  watering.  In
many parts of the country outdoor watering is the majority of resi-
dential use. Better industrial use. Thirty to 35 percent.

In  the  agricultural  sector  as  we  have  already  heard  enormous
progress  has  been  made,  but  enormous  progress  remains  to  be
made. We did an estimate for California looking at the potential of
a five to fifteen percent improvement in agricultural water use effi-
ciency,  permitting  us  to  grow  the  same  amount  of  food  with  less
water.

And  because  agriculture  consumes  80  percent  of  the  water  that
is  consumed  in  the  U.S.,  that  small  percentage  of  improvement  is
a lot of water. So the potential for efficiency improvements is enor-
mous.

Ms. DAHLKEMPER. Would anyone else like to comment?
Dr.  VAUX.  Let  me  make  one  comment  about  the  water  quality
and  the  preservation  of  water  quality.  There  has  been  a  lot  of  dis-
cussion here about the role of technology and about the importance
of technology. The missing point has been this one. Virtually every
economic  study  shows  that  it  is  cheaper  to  prevent  water  contami-
nation  in  the  first  place  than  it  is  to  clean  it  up  once  it  has  oc-
curred.

And  in  seeking  a  balanced  approach  to  our  water  quality  prob-
lems,  which  will  be  important  in  terms  of  determining  how  much

water  supply  is  available,  it  will  be  critical  to  recognize  that  pre-
vention must play an important role.

Dr. GLEICK. And one thing on the technology front as far as that
goes is we have to start looking at just our use of water differently.
I  mean,  the  driveway  analogy  is  a  great  one.  You  didn’t  need  the
top-quality  water  from  the  house  that  was  all  clean  and  went
through all the systems to treat that. If we started looking at how
we develop technologies where we can re-use and create gray water
within our own homes or within neighborhoods or within cities and
use  another  quality  of  water  to  handle  things  like  watering  lawns
and  cleaning  cars  and  things  along  those  lines,  we  would  make  a
great  jump  in  being  able  to  preserve  water.  And  there  are  other
countries  who  have  been  very  aggressive  at  that;  the  Israelis,  the
Swiss, Singaporeans have all moved very aggressively on water re-
use.

Ms. DAHLKEMPER. Thank you. I yield back my time.
Chair  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Ms.  Dahlkemper.  Okay.  Mr.  Hall
passes so Mr. Luja´n, you are recognized for five minutes or for four
minutes.
Mr.  LUJA´ N.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair.  I  won’t  take  much  time.
Thank  you  to  each  of  you  who  are  here  today.  I  know  that  there
are  at  least  a  few  of  you  who  have  a  lot  of  familiarity  with  New
Mexico  and  some  of  the  work  that  has  been  happening  out  there,
and  so  I  would  like  to,  you  know,  pose  my  question  specifically  to
you.

With  the  creation  of  the  Water  Resource  Research  Institutes  in
each of our states and territories across the country, specifically the
work  that  is  being  done  in  New  Mexico  or  in  different  regions  of
the  country,  the  importance  of  supporting  those  institutes,  if  you
could explain that.

But  as  well  is  there  coordination  that  is  taking  place  with  our
universities,  our  local  governments,  with  those  that  oversee,  you
know,  state  engineers  that  oversee  small  public  water  utilities  as
an  example,  coordination  with  the  League  of  Cities  and  the  Na-
tional  Association  of  Counties?  What  specifically  is  working  there,
and is this a good place to target some of the support when we are
talking  about  the  importance  of  looking  at  how  we  can  maximize
and  localize  the  research  and  to  be  able  to  get  the  data  that  we
need to be able to make good decisions?

Dr.  VAUX.  I  have  been  associated  with  that  program  in  one  way
or  another  since  1965,  and  I  think  the  program  does  not  get  very
substantial  level  of  funding,  about  $6  million  annually.  What  it  is
doing  most  effectively  right  now  is  the  communications  task  and
keeping  the  water  resources  expertise  at  all  the  colleges  and  uni-
versities in each state knit together in ways that I think the Chair
envisions for his bill here in the Federal Government.

The  research  budget  is,  of  course,  starved,  so  that  the  commu-
nications  task  is  the  primary  one  that  the  institutes  are  executing
effectively. Not only within the states as I just described but among
the  states  because  there  isn’t  a  national  association.  An  institute
needs State and the trust territories and those people communicate
with  each  other,  and  there  is  now  an  annual  three-year  review  of
those  programs  which  generates  a  lot  of  information  about  what
they are contributing.

54

So  I  and  my  testimony  indicates  that  I  think  the  institute  pro-
gram is a useful way to fold in the academic community to this ini-
tiative  and  ensure  that  the  portfolio  which  is  out  of  balance  with
respect  to  short-term  and  long-term  research  gets  rebalanced,  be-
cause  the  academic  community  is  really  in  a  better  position  to  do
the long-term research.

Chair  GORDON.  Mr.  Luja´n,  would  you  yield  to  Ms.  Giffords  for
our  last  question,  and  then  we,  by  House  rules,  are  going  to  have
to end this hearing.

Ms.  GIFFORDS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair.  Thank  you  for  coming  to
testify. I just said earlier this morning in a speech that I think the
future  wars  will  be  fought  not  over  oil  but  over  water,  and  this  is
a  very  serious  topic,  and  I  am  glad  that  the  Chair  is  addressing
this.

Generally, like Mr. Luja´n, I come from the west, the State of Ari-
zona. We have a booming population. In terms of a national water
policy,  we  are,  I  am  not  interested  in  moving  to  Ms.  Dahlkemper’s
district.  Those  of  us  that  want  to  stay  in  the  west,  that  like  the
southwest, realize that we are going to have to have different poli-
cies that affect us compared to different states.

So, you know, could members of the panel talk about how we im-
plement  a  national  water  policy  when  the  west  is  going  to  be
disproportionally affected because of climate change?.

Dr. GLEICK. There are things that we have to do at the national
level,  and  there  are  things  we  have  to  do  at  the  local  or  regional
level. Certainly better management of water in the west when you
talk  about  an  Integrated  Colorado  River  System,  for  example,
which affects Arizona enormously, is a regional issue with national
pieces to it. But we don’t want 50 state standards for water quality.
We  don’t  want  50  state  standards  for  the  efficiency  of  appliances.
So the important thing to do here, and I think one of the important
things this bill tries to address, is to decide what needs to be done
at  the  national  level  and  to  do  it  as  efficiently  as  possible,  to  inte-
grate  the  research  across  the  25  or  so  federal  agencies  that  do  re-
search in an appropriate way, and to leave the rest of the stuff for
the local level and the State level.

There are things that the western U.S. is going to have to do on
its  own.  There  are  things  that  the  U.S.  Government  ought  to  do
differently in the west as well. It depends on the issue, depends on
the region. But I think that separation is critical.

Chair  GORDON.  Thank  you  very  much.  The  joint  session  is  just
about to begin, so I want to thank our witnesses for appearing be-
fore  the  Committee  this  morning.  The  record  will  remain  open  for
two weeks for additional statements from the Members and for an-
swers to all the follow-up questions the Committee may ask of the
witnesses. You can see this is an issue of interest.

And this committee is now adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 10:59 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Henry Vaux, Jr., Professor Emeritus, University of California, Berkeley;

Associate Vice President Emeritus, University of California System

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. Dr. Vaux, you contend that the problems associated with the current state of fed-
eral  water  research  are  NOT  due  to  funding,  but  rather  a  lack  of  coordination
and  strategy.  If  such  coordination  and  strategies  were  instituted,  could  we  get
the  water  research  information  for  less  than  the  $700  million  we  currently
spend?

A1. Current  levels  of  spending—$700  million  in  constant  2000  dollars—is  identical
to what the Nation spent on water research in the early 1970s. Given that the mag-
nitude  of  our  water  problems  is  much  greater  now  than  it  was  then,  it  is  hard  to
argue  that  we  should  spend  less  than  $700  million.  The  point  that  I  was  trying  to
make is that the need for coordination and a strategic approach is greater than the
need for additional dollars. Elsewhere in my testimony I suggested that perhaps an
additional  $70  million  for  water  research  be  authorized  to  provide  appropriate  in-
centives  for  the  coordinating  and  strategic  actions  that  are  envisioned  in  the  bill.
Q2. If the interagency committee authorized in the Act is so similar to the Water Re-
sources Council authorized by the 1965 Act, how do we prevent the same ineffec-
tive outcomes and turf battles between agencies as we saw in the Council?

A2. As I suggested in my testimony, it might make sense to authorize an additional
$70 million in appropriations to support additional research under the coordinating
and strategic activities promoted by the bill. This would give the agencies an incen-
tive  to  improve  coordination  and  strategic  planning  rather  than  to  continue  bick-
ering and turf protecting.
Q3. You  made  several  suggestions  on  the  section  of  the  legislation  that  outlines  the
National  Water  Availability  Research  and  Assessment  Plan  Outcomes.  Given
your  suggestions,  should  these  outcomes  be  determined  by  the  interagency  com-
mittee instead of being explicitly outlined in the legislation?

A3. The  two  additional  outcomes  identified  in  my  testimony  should  be  included  in
the  legislative  language  (or  as  a  last  resort,  in  the  Committee  Report).  Research  in
the  social  sciences  related  to  water  have  been  neglected  for  the  last  two  decades,
Such  neglect  is  likely  to  continue  in  the  absence  of  Congressional  prodding.  Re-
search  on  the  implications  of  climate  change  is  simply  so  important  that  it  needs
to be mentioned.
Q4. Are  the  four  broad  themes  you  list  in  your  testimony  the  only  modern  themes
appropriate  for  federal  water  research?  Can  traditional  research  approaches  be
used  in  addition  to  these  frameworks?  Are  there  likely  to  be  any  more  themes
identified in the future?

A4. Traditional approaches can be used but they should explicitly acknowledge and
consider  modern  themes,  including  the  four  identified  in  my  testimony.  It  is  pos-
sible, of course, that new themes will emerge with time.

Questions submitted by Representative Bob Inglis
Q1. Witnesses in our previous hearing state that the improved horizontal cooperation
among federal agencies should also be coupled with vertical coordination at the
State, regional and local levels.

Q1a. Would  you  recommend  that  this  vertical  integration  be  a  part  of  the  research

strategy? Or would you be concerned that this could bog down the effort?

A1a. Vertical integration should be included and acknowledged. It is clear, however,
that  the  states,  regions  and  localities  are  unable  to  support  much  water  research
financially. Therefore, they should be included in strategic discussions and research
agenda  setting  activities  as  stakeholders.  Ultimately,  the  financial  decisions  should
be made by those who pay.
Q1b. Should  the  coordination  of  local  and  State  resources  be  underway  before  the
federal  agency  coordination  in  order  to  better  determine  the  structure  that  re-
sponds to the needs of the State and local resources?

57

A1b. State  and  local  activities  are  never  going  to  be  very  well  coordinated  in  the
absence of leadership at the federal level. Leadership at the federal level should ac-
knowledge  the  importance  of  State  and  local  contributions  and  incorporate  State
and local views in strategic research planning.
Q2. You state in your written testimony that Water Resources Research Institutes are
uniquely  situated  to  assist  in  the  National  Water  Initiative.  Do  you  think  that
these  Institutes  should  continue  under  their  existing  mandate  as  authorized  in
the Water Resources Research Act? Or should their role be expanded under this
Initiative due to your national reach and State focus?

A2. The  significant  potential  of  the  Water  Resources  Research  Institutes  has  not
been realized in nearly three decades. The Institutes are uniquely situated to bring
the views and priorities of states, regions and localities to bear on an integrated na-
tional initiative to identify a strategic research agenda. The Institutes are also well-
situated  to  bring  the  considerable  research  capability  of  the  Nation’s  universities
and colleges to bear on the research itself. I would suggest that the role of the Insti-
tutes  be  expanded  to  involve  them  in  national  agenda  setting  and  in  the  execution
of  long-term  water  research  and  whatever  applied  research  might  be  appropriately
assigned to the academic community.

I would emphasize that the Institutes have a strong record in education and pub-
lic  communication  about  water  resources.  The  fact  that  the  Institutes  are  situated
in the U.S. Geologic Survey adds additional strength inasmuch as the Survey as ex-
tensive  education  and  communication  programs  itself  in  all  of  the  States  and  trust
territories. As one of the two largest water research agencies programmatically and
in  terms  of  funding  makes  the  combined  education  and  communication  activities  of
the Institutes and the Geological Survey the strongest available nationally.

Questions submitted by Representative Adrian Smith
Q1. Would a top-down research agenda meet the needs of local water demands? Or,
would any research agenda need to be an amalgamation of a bottom-up and top-
down approach? How would that work?

A1. The  research  agenda  setting  would  need  to  be  an  amalgamation  of  both  ap-
proaches.  One  way  to  ensure  that  such  a  approach  will  work  is  to  give  states,  re-
gions and localities as will as the academic research community places as significant
stakeholders  in  the  agenda  setting  process.  All  water  problems  are  inherently  local
or regional so it would be very important to do this.

Questions submitted by Representative Dana Rohrabacher
Q1. Dr.  Vaux,  in  your  testimony  you  state  that  there  is  virtually  no  possibility  that
water supplies in the future can be made to grow. What about technological ad-
vancements that allow for previously unusable water to be cleaned up and avail-
able  for  new  use?  Isn’t  the  purpose  of  treating  ocean  water  or  brackish  water  to
make it available for some future use?

A1. Virtually  all  of  our  water  supplies  are  already  allocated  as  among  municipal,
industrial,  agricultural  and  environmental  uses.  This  means  that  there  is  virtually
no  surplus  that  can  be  allocated  to  new  and  growing  uses.  It  means  that  we  need
to  look  to  reallocation  mechanisms  to  ensure  that  new  and  growing  uses  can  be
served.  It  is  true,  as  you  suggest,  that  wastewater  treatment  technologies  and  de-
salination  technologies  can  make  additional  supplies  available.  The  former  do  this
by  recycling  water  that  has  already  been  allocated  and  used  while  the  latter  truly
do bring new water supplies to the scene. The difficulties with ocean water desalina-
tion have been detailed in a recent report from the National Research Council. The
two most important potential difficulties are the environmental implications of brine
water  disposal  and  the  fact  that  the  technologies  are  very  expenses  in  comparison
with  the  costs  of  most  existing  supplies.  The  fact  that  desalination  and  wastewater
treatment technologies are energy intensive is also cause for concern, given that en-
ergy prices are likely to rise in the future.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Peter  H.  Gleick,  Co-Founder  and  President,  The  Pacific  Institute  for

Studies in Development, Environment, and Security, Oakland, California

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. Dr.  Gleick,  as  you  may  be  aware,  Dr.  Vaux  has  commented  that  the  problems
arising  from  the  current  state  of  federal  water  research  are  due  to  coordination
and strategy issues, and that the level of funding is not inadequate. How do you
reconcile his position with your statement that the federal priorities have already
been  outlined  and  all  we  need  is  the  funding  and  the  effort  to  do  the  research?
A1. I believe that the lack of coordination among federal agencies on water research
is  well  documented  and  I  strongly  support  improving  that  coordination.  I  also  be-
lieve  that  several  very  valuable  federal  assessments  have  been  done  on  federal  pri-
orities,  including  the  SWAQ,  GAO,  and  National  Academy  studies.  This  in  no  way
contradicts Dr. Vaux’s position, but rather supplements it. Moreover, there is no fed-
eral  funding,  or  inadequate  federal  funding,  to  support  all  of  the  recommendations
in  these  studies,  which  suggests  the  need  for  additional  financial  support,  or  at  a
minimum, a re-allocation among priorities.
Q2. Witnesses  in  our  previous  hearing  states  that  the  improved  horizontal  coopera-
tion  among  federal  agencies  should  also  be  coupled  with  vertical  coordination
at the State, regional and local levels.

Q2a. Would  you  recommend  that  this  vertical  integration  be  a  part  of  the  research

strategy? Or would you be concerned that this could bog down the effort?

A2a. I believe this could be a valuable effort, but it must be carefully done to avoid
duplication  of  effort  and  the  appropriate  allocation  of  cost  and  responsibility  to  the
appropriate agencies.
Q2b. Should  the  coordination  of  local  and  State  resources  be  underway  before  the
federal  agency  coordination  in  order  to  better  determine  the  structure  that  re-
sponds to the needs of the State and local resources?

A2b. I  have  no  strong  opinion  about  how  such  coordination  would  be  most  effec-
tively accomplished.
Q3. Please share any concerns you might have about the advisory board that the leg-
islation includes. Would this serve the purpose you mentioned in your testimony
about bringing outside water experts to the table? Why or why not?

A3. I  would  prefer  to  see  outside  water  experts  directly  involved,  rather  than  just
as  an  ‘‘advisory  board.’’  My  experience  is  that  such  boards  are  often  either  never
consulted, or ignored.
Q4. One of the recommendations in your testimony is that if there is to be a National
Water  Census  it  should  include  comprehensive  information  on  water  use.  Why
do you feel such information is vital? Do you think such information might lead
to restrictions on uses of water?

A4. This  is  indeed  vital:  without  good  information  on  how  we  use  water  and  what
we do with it, it is impossible to formulate good water policy. In fact, I believe such
information would help reduce the risk that there will be inappropriate ‘‘restrictions
on  water  use.’’  The  more  we  know  about  how  we  use  water,  the  more  likely  it  is
that we will properly prioritize in times of shortage.
Q5. With  the  recent  passage  of  the  American  Recovery  and  Reinvestment  Act  of
2009  along  with  the  Omnibus  and  the  President’s  budget,  do  you  still  fill  that
new money is necessary for the establishment of a coordinating body for national
water  research?  Do  you  still  believe  that  agency  budgets  remain  underfunded
and therefore agencies will be against diverting funds to a separate interagency
committee?

A5. The  ARRA  of  2009  will  only  help  this  problem  if  (a)  agencies  choose  to  divert
funds committed for other purposes or (b) separate funds are specified by Congress.
I do not know whether agencies will divert funds to the purpose of coordinating na-
tional water programs.

Questions submitted by Representative Bob Inglis
Q1. Your  testimony  calls  for  any  research  on  the  implications  of  climate  change  to
include  ‘‘appropriate  strategies  for  adapting  to  those  climate  impacts  that  may
be  unavoidable.’’  Is  there  currently  research  being  done  in  this  area?  Which
agency  would  you  task  with  such  research  and  how  much  funding  would  you
dedicate to such research?

A1. In a memo I prepared for the Administration’s transition team, I recommended
an annual budget of only $1 million to conduct a comprehensive analysis of climate
impact  and  adaptation,  but  this  must  be  a  regular  budget  for  an  ongoing  program.
Such as assessment could be done, or at least coordinated, by OSTP or CEQ.
Q2. Dr.  Gleick,  you  mentioned  in  your  testimony  that  ‘‘many  of  our  water  problems
are  local,  and  must  be  resolved  at  the  local  and  regional  level.’’  Back  in  my
home  State  of  South  Carolina,  the  Strom  Thurmond  Institute  is  prepared  to
launch  a  complete  water  budget  analysis  of  the  Upstate  of  South  Carolina.  The
goal of their efforts is to create an analysis prediction tool that will assist people
like  us  in  understanding  the  availability  of  water  currently  and  in  the  future
so that local, regional, and federal officials can make better planning decisions.

Q2a. Will H.R. 1145 support these types of regional and local efforts?
A2a. I  do  not  know;  I  believe  that  local  assessments  should  be  conducted  locally,
perhaps  with  some  federal  funds  to  permit  diverse  local  assessments  to  contribute
to  a  national  assessment,  such  as  recommended  in  the  Census  provisions  of  H.R.
1145.
Q2b. Are there changes we could make to improve the bill in this area?
A2b. No answer given.

Questions submitted by Representative Adrian Smith
Q1. In  your  testimony  you  include  several  suggestions  for  improving  H.R.  1145  as
introduced.  You  indicate  that  you  do  not  endorse  the  idea  of  a  new  interagency
committee  but  instead  would  rather  see  an  expansion  of  the  Subcommittee  on
Water Quality and Availability, which would include outside agency experts.

Q1a. Why do you believe a new committee is unnecessary?
A1a. I believe SWAQ has excellent representation of diverse federal agencies; their
work  has  been  valuable.  Why  reinvent  the  wheel,  so  to  speak.  The  flaw  of  SWAQ
is the lack of outside (non-federal agency) representation.
Q1b. Which  outside  water  experts  would  you  include  and  how  would  you  ensure

against conflicts of interest?

A1b. A  range  of  other  interests,  from  research  groups,  to  academics,  to  business
groups,  to  consumer  groups,  to  environmental  groups  all  have  interests  in  national
water challenges. Standard methods are available to prevent conflict of interest.
Q2. Why  do  you  feel  that  establishment  of  a  National  Water  Board  is  more  effective

at addressing water issues than the entity proposed in the bill?

A2. I  do  not  know  if  it  would  be  more  effective.  I  am  arguing,  however,  that  the
entity proposed in the bill would not address as broad a set of problem as a National
Commission/Board might be.

Questions submitted by Representative Dana Rohrabacher
Q1. In your testimony, you state that we do not need a new committee to lay out the
priorities  because  the  priorities  have  already  been  established  by  several  other
reports.

Q1a. Do  all  the  reports  share  the  same  opinion  about  what  goals  need  to  be  accom-
plished  and  how  to  best  achieve  those  goals?  If  not,  where  do  they  differ  and
how would you choose which priorities and methods were correct?

A1a. There  has  been  remarkably  unanimity  about  the  major  goals  that  should  be
tackled.  Where  there  are  differences,  the  Committee  can  choose  how  to  move  for-
ward.
Q1b. Is  the  technology  readily  available  to  accomplish  these  goals  or  will  that  re-

quire additional research?

A1b. I  believe  our  problem  is  not  lack  of  technology,  for  the  most  part.  Even  with
desalination, the National Academy concluded that improvements in environmental
protection  and  economics  were  more  critical  to  the  success  of  desalination  than  im-
provements in technology.

Responses  by  F.  Mark  Modzelewski,  Executive  Director,  Water  Innovations  Alliance

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. You  reference  in  your  testimony  utilizing  the  21st  Century  Nanotechnology  Re-
search and Development Act as a model for interagency coordination and public
private  collaboration  on  key  water  technology  issues.  Which  elements  of  the  Act
do you see as particularly useful in addressing key water technology issues?

A1. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) and its enabling legislation posi-
tioned the United States as the leader in nanotechnology research and development,
and kicked off a global nanotechnology race. The NNI has been emulated both with-
in  the  Federal  Government  and  in  foreign  countries  that  wish  to  compete  with  the
United States. The most useful elements of the bill included the following:

a director and full-time staff, to ensure that the NNI ran smoothly;

• The  establishment  of  the  National  Nanotechnology  Coordination  Office,  with
• The active involvement of the business and academic sectors;
• The  focus  on  translational  research  and  applications  (including  outreach  to
• A broad advisory panel that could provide insightful real-world feedback;
• External review;
• The creation of nanotechnology centers throughout the Nation; and
• Adequate funding.

start-up companies);

Finally,  although  it  may  seem  like  a  small  matter,  the  symbolism  involved  in  a
bill that called for ‘‘ensuring United States global leadership in the development and
application  of  nanotechnology’’  was  vital.  In  addition,  a  large  part  of  the  success  of
the  NNI  has  been  due  to  dynamic  leadership,  something  that  can’t  easily  be  initi-
ated via legislative language.
Q2. Do you regard the investment made by GE in water R&D and technological de-
velopment  in  the  same  light  as  your  testimony  generally  states  about  corporate
investment  in  R&D?  Would  you  consider  GE  to  be  a  leader,  the  average,  or  one
of  those  who  don’t  ‘‘put  their  money  where  their  mouth  is’’  corporations  com-
pared with other companies you are familiar with?

A2. While  I  cannot  speak  definitively  about  internal  GE  programs,  as  an  outside
observer it appears that GE is indeed spending a great deal on clean-tech research.
However,  very  little  of  this  appears  to  be  for  the  water  category.  This  is  likely  due
to  a  few  factors.  First,  GE  is  new  to  water.  They  only  developed  GE  Water  within
the  past  decade,  and  that  division  of  the  company  is  made  up  of  many  recently  ac-
quired  assets.  Hence  creating  a  business  and  culture  around  these  new  pieces  has
clearly  been—and  should  be—‘‘Job  One.’’  I  would  expect  GE’s  investment  in  water
innovation  to  increase  significantly  over  the  coming  years.  Second,  the  water  field
as  a  whole  is  not  very  innovative,  as  was  repeatedly  noted  during  the  hearing.  It
is focused on incremental improvements to pipes, pumps, filters and chemicals, rath-
er  than  large-scale,  game-changing  innovations.  There  are  individual  professors  at
UT, MIT and elsewhere with more patents than the world’s largest water company,
Suez.  While  there  are  innovative  start-ups,  mid-sized  firms,  and  even  municipal
water  departments,  out  of  the  large  industry  players  only  Siemens  has  put  a  pre-
mium on developing innovation. Ultimately it would be difficult to point to any com-
pany as a great role model for innovation and technology development in the water
industry.
Q3. In  your  testimony  you  stress  that  nearly  all  research  has  been  focused  on  little
tweaks to make current water processes and technologies marginally cleaner and
more  energy  efficient  without  exploring  game-changing  approaches.  Could  you
please  provide  us  with  some  examples  of  potential  game  changing  approaches
and  what  elements  including  funding  would  permit  them  to  develop  into  com-
mon practice?

A3. My  vocation  in  life  is  as  an  entrepreneur  and  investor.  I  spent  the  past  three
years looking for a water technology worth developing and investing in at university
and  government  labs  across  America  and  across  the  world  for  that  matter.  I  can
honestly say I was horrified by the utter lack of innovation in this critical field. This
finding  was  a  key  factor  that  led  a  group  of  us  to  form  the  Water  Innovations  Alli-
ance.

I  can  say  without  hesitation  that  Australia,  Israel,  and  Singapore  are  attacking
water technology at a rate far surpassing the U.S., as are others. The reason is that
the U.S. not only lacks research funding at the corporate and government level, but
also that to date it has found other ways of addressing any disasters when they hap-
pen.  Other  nations  have  felt  the  impact  of  global  water  issues  sooner.  In  addition,
water  research  in  the  U.S.  is  still  done  by  environmental  engineers  and  materials
scientists  working  independently,  rather  than  as  part  of  cross-disciplinary  efforts
with biologists, physicists, and others.

That point made, the following are examples of potentially game-changing innova-

tion:
Forward  Osmosis:  FO  is  an  osmotic  process  that,  like  reverse  osmosis,  uses  a
semi-permeable membrane to effect separation of water from dissolved solutes. The
driving force for this separation is an osmotic pressure gradient, such that a ‘‘draw’’
solution of high concentration (relative to that of the feed solution), is used to induce
a  net  flow  of  water  through  the  membrane  into  the  draw  solution,  thus  effectively
separating  the  feed  water  from  its  solutes.  In  contrast,  the  reverse  osmosis  process
uses hydraulic pressure as the driving force for separation, which serves to counter-
act  the  osmotic  pressure  gradient  that  would  otherwise  favor  water  flux  from  the
permeate  to  the  feed.  The  creation  of  hydraulic  pressure  for  RO  requires  a  lot  of
energy and accounts for about 50 percent of the cost of RO desalination.
RNAi  Water  Purification:  Disclosure,  I  am  assisting  the  researcher  of  this  tech-
nology in her efforts to further develop and commercialize it some day. Dr. Claudia
Gunsch at Duke University is truly one of our nation’s brightest young researchers.
She  has  little  experience  setting  up  a  company  and  getting  funding  or  executives
in  place  so  I  am  working  with  her  to  make  this  happen  as  I  find  her  discovery  to
be nothing short of extraordinary. What Dr. Gunsch has done is use RNAi, a biotech
technique  that  won  the  Nobel  Prize  a  few  years  back,  to  silence  the  genes  in  bac-
teria,  viruses  and  algae  in  water.  What  she  has  effectively  done  is  create  a  ‘‘green’’
biocide—no chemicals or extensive energy usage.

The  issue  with  both  of  these  innovative  technologies  is  difficulty  getting  funding
to advance them from lab to marketplace. For instance, the RNAi research falls be-
tween  the  gaps  of  biotechnology  research  and  environmental  engineering.  Because
grants are awarded through a peer review system of leading specialists, and because
neither biotechnologists nor environmental engineers understand the effort enough,
the  technology  has  difficulty  attracting  grant  funding.  The  technology  is  early,  so
its difficult to get the private sector (especially in this economy) involved. These fac-
tors could in fact doom research in what many people believe to be the most ground-
breaking discovery in the field in more than 50 years.
Q4. Is  there  any  movement  in  the  industry  to  create  common  IT  standards?  Many
of  these  types  of  standards  have,  in  the  past,  come  from  industry  collaboration
or  cooperation;  however  you  suggest  that  it  be  coordinated  by  the  government?
Does  the  fact  that  this  effort  is  not  currently  being  driven  by  industry  suggest
that  information  technology  as  a  tool  to  monitor  and  manage  is  still  a  nascent
concept to those in water management?

A4. There was been an organizing effort over the past year lead by IBM, SAP, sev-
eral  NGOs  and  municipal  water  organizations.  It  is  at  a  very  early  stage  and  the
Water Innovations Alliance is taking over managing this effort this quarter.

Unlike many other areas in IT, water is closely tied to government. From quality
standards to municipal waste management, to public lands and waterways, govern-
ment  is  in  charge  of  the  sector.  In  addition,  such  oversight  cuts  across  Federal,
State and local government regimes as well as different agencies—even foreign trea-
ties come into play.

Because of this, while I would note that the government does not necessarily have
the  expertise  to  develop  the  standards,  government  needs  to  be  involved  front  and
center.  Government  also  can  provide  incentives  to  cooperate,  which  are  needed
here—as is the government’s ability to bring people to the table.

It is my recommendation that the federal water initiative group that this legisla-
tion  develops  quickly  convenes  a  working  group  on  water  IT  and  that  it  bring  to
the  table  IT  leaders,  as  well  as  traditional  water  industry  players,  municipalities,
NGOs and of course State, federal and government leaders. The group needs to de-
velop  a  scope,  measurable  goals  and  timelines  for  the  creation  of  a  common  stand-
ards,  measures  and  reporting  using  existing  infrastructure  capabilities  and  lay  out
a  plan  for  developing  out  new  measurement  and  monitoring  systems  and  linking
them together to essentially create a national water smart grid.

Q5. The  concept  of  a  national  ‘‘smart  water  grid’’  is  mentioned  in  your  testimony.

Could you be more specific about just what such a ‘‘grid’’ would encompass?

63

A5. I will note that while many people in the water field agree on the need to create
a water IT system for better management, there are many different ideas as to what
it  means  to  have  a  smart  grid  in  place,  and  my  vision  is  merely  one  of  many.  In
general, everyone agrees that an enterprise IT system can help to manage the water
supply  &  demand  equation  (on  a  local  level)  because  the  smart  grid  sees  the  whole
picture  of  water  availability  and  water  demand—including  how  it  relates  to  energy
(NOTE:  approximately  35  percent  of  a  typical  municipality’s  energy  budget  is  allo-
cated  to  municipal  water  use  and  treatment—and  many  times  more  than  this  in  a
place  like  Los  Angeles).  This  implies  the  need  to  be  able  to  prioritize  and  optimize
the  multiple  demands  (and  even  to  potentially  automate  some  of  the  decisions  re-
lated to demand). It also implies that information about a water system is available,
is  shared  openly  and  can  be  analyzed  to  look  for  patterns.  Once  we  see  patterns,
we can use the data to look for similar trends and create some predictive capability,
which  means  potential  problems  can  be  anticipated,  and  maybe  even  eliminated  in
some cases.

A  smart  water  grid  should  have  the  ability  to  understand  and  manage  an  entire
water system. At a micro level it would enable managers to know the quality, usage
levels,  breaches,  and  discharges  in  clean  and  wastewater  running  through  pipes  in
a city. At a macro level it would allow for modeling against the weather, or for bet-
ter  energy  savings  in  processing  waste  water,  or  how  drought  in  a  watershed  two
states away is affecting river water and what that will ultimately mean for a city’s
water quality, use and even energy production.

We  already  have  all  the  technology  in  place  to  create  a  smart  water  grid.  What
we don’t have is a common standard of evaluation or reporting. Nor do we have the
data-collecting nodes in all the places we need them to feed data into systems (EX:
a  sensor  system  through  out  a  municipal  system  of  pipes).  Additional  research
would be needed to do justice to any fiscal estimates.

Questions submitted by Representative Bob Inglis
Q1. You  suggest  that  a  new  generation  of  water  monitoring  techniques  and  tech-
nologies  be  developed  to  assist  with  the  creation  of  a  National  Water  Census
database.  Are  you  aware  of  any  techniques  or  technologies  being  developed  in
other  countries  that  could  be  readily  adopted  in  the  U.S.  to  speed  up  such  an
assessment?

A1. Singapore,  Israel  and  Switzerland  all  have  superior  systems  in  place  when  it
comes  to  monitoring,  regulating  and  managing  water.  None  of  them  has  a  cohesive
smart water grid, but they are moving towards it.

For  instance  Singapore  requires  the  re-use  of  wastewater.  This  obviously  is  a
tricky  business  where  by  constant  and  accurate  quality  monitoring  is  needed
through  a  greater  system,  not  just  at  the  plant  level.  In  addition  Singapore  ‘‘im-
ports’’ water from Malaysia and that effort also requires very specific monitoring to
manage cost effectively and ensure treaty compliance and ensure human health. To
make  this  effort  more  robust  and  increase  management  capabilities,  Singapore  has
contracted  with  MIT  for  a  bold  new  international  research  program  led  by  MIT’s
Professor Andrew Whittle that involves several dozen researchers from MIT and two
Singaporean universities. These researchers are developing pervasive environmental
sensor  networks  to  collect  data  on  water  quality  from  many  sources,  and  use  these
data to provide accurate, real-time monitoring, modeling and control of the environ-
ment.

Questions submitted by Representative Adrian Smith
Q1. How  does  the  Water  Innovations  Alliance  work  with  large  scale  industrial  and
agricultural  users  of  water?  For  example,  does  the  Water  Innovations  Alliance
work  with  energy  producers,  goods  manufacturers,  farmers  and  ranchers  to  de-
velop water use and efficiency strategies?

A1. The  Water  Innovations  Alliance  is  a  young  organization  having  formed  in  Q3
2008.  We  are  continuing  to  refine  our  mission  all  the  time  in  order  to  bring  real
change  and  innovation  to  the  water  sector  via  education,  creative  partnerships,  in-
formation gathering, working to reduce regulatory barriers to innovation, increasing
collaboration  and  raising  awareness  for  cutting-edge  water  technologies  and  the
problems they solve.

The  Alliance  serves  the  entire  spectrum  of  the  water  sector:  corporations,  inves-
tors,  engineering  firms,  start-ups,  NGOs,  research  centers,  municipalities,  and  oth-
ers  in  the  field.  Our  first  big  initiatives  are  pushing  awareness  around  the  impor-
tance of water IT, ensuring that research efforts increase around energy efficient de-
salination, and gathering data on where cutting edge water research is being done,
by whom and linking it to where it is most needed.

We  are  looking  to  tie  together  working  groups  and  consortiums  around  these
issues that will indeed bring together all key stakeholders from industrial and agri-
culture interests, to technology providers, invests, NGOs and government as well as
users.

Questions submitted by Representative Dana Rohrabacher
Q1. How  would  the  research  centers  you  advocate  in  your  testimony  differ  from  the
Water  Resources  Research  Institutes  that  exist  in  every  state  and  territories?
Would the work be so different that we couldn’t just use the current institutional
infrastructure  to  conduct  this  research?  Why  should  NSF  be  the  agency  in
charge of these centers as opposed to another agency?

A1. The  Water  Resources  Research  Institutes  program  has  been  a  fine  program.
The  issue  is  they  tackle  a  narrow  set  of  tasks  much  to  the  mission  of  USGS,  such
as the environmental monitoring of rivers, streams and coastal systems. These Cen-
ters have not been places for developing technologies for consumer, municipal, agri-
cultural  and  industrial  systems—the  engineering  and  management  issues  if  you
will.  For  instance  they  don’t  work  on  water  filtration  systems,  the  membranes,  the
engineering,  or  the  energy  usage  methods.  For  those  efforts  you  have  just  a  few
water  technology  research  centers,  such  as  UC–Irvine,  UCLA,  CO  School  of  Mines,
and  the  NSF  center  at  U.  IL.  These  technology  centers  are  frankly  not  very  well
funded  when  compared  to  other  scientific  research  efforts—especially  given  the
stakes  and  the  impact.  The  NSF  Center,  in  addition,  will  be  sunsetting  in  just  a
couple of years.
Q2. I am intrigued by your concept of a National Water Pilot Testing Facility.
Q2a. Do  you  believe  a  facility  like  this  would  have  encouraged  faster  adoption  of

water technologies than was achieved through local ordinances?

Q2b. Could you provide the Committee with examples of the regulatory barriers that

hinder innovation and testing of new solutions for the water industry?

A2a,b. Yes,  mainly  because  there  are  so  many  overlapping  jurisdictions  in  water.
For  example,  San  Francisco  Bay  has  water  regulations  from  all  the  towns  on  the
Bay,  those  affected  by  its  waters,  a  dozen  federal  and  State  agencies,  and  special
water  districts,  not  to  mention  issues  where  activists  involve  the  courts.  Any  at-
tempt  to  try  a  new  purification  system  technology  in  say  Oakland  would  lead  to
years  (a  decade  is  a  reasonable  estimate)  of  paperwork  and  untold  costs  with  no
budget  to  speak  of  to  tackle  these  burdens.  It  puts  systems  in  a  position  to  always
use old ways that are ‘‘good enough.’’ And is a big reason while a huge number are
out of compliance with current federal standards.

Because  water  has  so  many  human  safety  impacts,  a  new  technology  essentially
has  to  be  proven  before  being  tested—a  paradox  that  nearly  eradicates  the  ability
to  try  any  game-changing  technologies.  Instead,  municipalities  and  the  companies
they  contract  with  make  only  minor  tweaks  or  face  the  impossible  task  of  getting
permission to try the new innovation.

A  pilot  facility  would  allow  for  the  testing  of  drinking  and  wastewater  systems
that  used  new  methodologies  as  well  as  ones  that  allowed  for  energy  savings.  It
would  also  allow  for  simulation  of  multiple  conditions  and  factors  so  as  to  ensure
human health and compliance with federal and State/local regulations.

In  addition,  if  managed  properly,  such  a  facility  could  indeed  become  self-sus-

taining financially by charging reasonable fees to corporate users.
Q2c. Could you provide the Committee with examples of the regulatory barriers that

hinder innovation and testing of new solutions for the water industry?

A2c. It  is  not  a  case  of  a  single  regulation  as  much  as  the  number  of  regulatory
bodies and the different standards for evaluation, reporting, compliance and permit-
ting  procedures  that  each  jurisdiction  requires.  Some  jurisdictions  have  rules  for
stormwater,  septic  tanks,  nutrients,  fertilizer,  pet  waste,  and  so  on.  Others  do  not.
So it’s the bureaucracy more than this regulatory verbiage versus the next one.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Nancy  K.  Stoner,  Co-Director,  Water  Program,  Natural  Resources  De-

fense Council (NRDC)

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. Ms.  Stoner,  you  mention  in  your  testimony  that  many  of  the  negative  changes
to our water are a result of ill-conceived agricultural, land development, and en-
ergy  practices.  Is  the  move  towards  biofuels  contributing  to  these  negative  im-
pacts to water?

A1. In part to help combat dangerous global warming, policy-makers in recent years
have become more interested in increasing the degree to which U.S. consumers rely
upon renewable fuels for their motor vehicles. However, policies that simply encour-
age  the  use  of  more  biofuels  such  as  ethanol  from  corn  could  result  in  an  increase
in  the  size  of  the  dead  zone,  because  corn  cultivation  typically  involves  larger
amounts  of  fertilizer  than  other  crops.  Experts  expect  rapid  growth  in  grain-based
ethanol production in the coming years; this potentially will have major implications
for the dead zone, unless there is a significantly greater focus on conservation prac-
tices  in  agriculture  in  general  and  the  performance  of  biofuels  production  specifi-
cally.

Corn  prices  have  increased  dramatically,  driven  by  energy  prices,  growing  inter-
national  demand,  and  increasing  demand  for  ethanol.  Not  surprisingly,  as  prices
have  gone  up,  so  has  the  number  of  acres  in  corn  production:  ‘‘Corn  acreage  in  the
United States rose to nearly 93 million acres in 2007 (a 17 percent increase), a level
not seen since 1944.’’ According to the Renewable Fuels Association, the trade group
for the ethanol industry, ‘‘ethanol soared to 6.5 billion gallons in 2007, a 32 percent
increase  from  the  4.9  billion  gallons  produced  in  2006.’’  Looking  forward,  the  Asso-
ciation  estimates  that  the  industry’s  production  capacity  will  rise  from  7.8  billion
gallons  in  2007  to  13  billion  gallons  once  the  biorefineries  currently  being  con-
structed or expanded come online. The vast majority of this new ethanol production
is likely to come from corn.

Legislation  also  drives  increased  corn  ethanol  production.  The  Energy  Independ-
ence and Security Act of 2007 will greatly expand biofuels production; it sets a tar-
get  of  at  least  36  billion  gallons  of  biofuels  per  year  by  2022.  Although  the  law
states  that  a  minimum  of  21  billion  gallons  must  be  ‘‘advanced’’  (derived  from
plants’  cellulosic  material  rather  than  corn  grain,  for  instance),  it  still  leaves  room
for at least 15 billion gallons of corn-based ethanol that year. This law does include
important  minimum  global  warming  pollution  standards  and  land  use  safeguards,
but it does not explicitly require better fertilizer management or overall water qual-
ity or quantity performance improvements.

Last October the National Research Council issued a report titled ‘‘Water Implica-
tions  of  Biofuels  Production  in  the  United  States.’’  This  review  makes  it  clear  that,
without  additional  safeguards,  increased  biofuels  production  can  be  expected  to  in-
crease water pollution from agriculture and intensify many regional and local water
shortages.  It  reaffirms  that  ‘‘[e]xpansion  of  ethanol  production  . . .  will  drive  in-
creased corn production until marketable future alternatives are developed.’’ The re-
port even addressed the particular concern of the dead zone:

All  else  being  equal,  the  conversion  of  other  crops  or  non-crop  plants  to  corn
will likely lead to much higher application rates of nitrogen. Given the correla-
tion of nitrogen application rates to stream concentrations of total nitrogen, and
of the latter to the increase in hypoxia in the Nation’s water bodies, the poten-
tial for additional corn-based ethanol production to increase the extent of these
hypoxic regions is considerable.

A  recent  scientific  review  reached  a  similar  conclusion.  To  roughly  estimate  the
scale  of  increased  nutrient  loading  associated  with  ethanol  production,  the  EPA
Science  Advisory  Board  used  predicted  corn  acreage  increases  in  the  next  several
years and estimated that the cultivation of the corn could lead to the increased run-
off of 238 million pounds of nitrogen per year in the Mississippi River Basin.

These  outcomes  are  not  inevitable.  Addressing  water  pollution  and  consumption
should  be  integrated  into  policies  and  programs  that  promote  biofuels  production,
such  as  tax  credits  and  other  incentives.  In  particular,  management  practices  that
help  reduce  nutrient  pollution  should  be  part  of  a  suite  of  minimum  standards  ap-
plicable to energy crop producers. (For NRDC’s roadmap to responsible biofuels pro-
duction,  see  Getting  Biofuels  Right:  Eight  Steps  for  Reaping  Real  Environmental

biofuels/right.pdf.)  More  generally,  as  pressure  builds  on  farmers  and  foresters  to
increase output and cut costs, farm bill programs to promote soil, water, and wildlife
conservation need to grow dramatically larger and more effective.
Q2. Ms.  Stoner,  in  your  testimony,  you  suggest  that  EPA  should  be  appropriated
$100  million  at  a  minimum  to  stimulate  both  R&D  and  demonstration  projects
and  that  another  $100  million  be  appropriated  to  be  split  among  the  Depart-
ments  of  Agriculture,  Commerce,  Defense,  Energy,  HHS,  HUD,  Interior  and
Transportation for innovative water management research.
a. Why do you believe that this funding approach will assist the U.S. in tackling

its many water problems?

b. Do  you  believe  that  EPA  is  the  most  qualified  to  conduct  R&D  and  dem-

onstration projects?

c. How  does  this  compare  with  other  issues  in  which  EPA  participates  in  a

multi-agency research effort?

A2. My  recommendation  is  that  EPA  should  be  funded  to  do  R&D  and  demonstra-
tion projects for water, stormwater, and wastewater infrastructure, including the in-
tegration  of  these  types  of  infrastructure,  because  EPA  has  ultimate  authority  for
those  systems  under  the  Clean  Water  Act  and  would  best  be  able  to  integrate  the
results  of  such  demonstration  projects  into  existing  programs.  There  is  a  tremen-
dous  need  for  innovation  in  water-related  services  delivery.  Most  treatment  tech-
nologies  current  in  use  in  the  U.S.  were  developed  in  the  early  20th  century  and
are no longer adequate for today’s population or for the stressors affecting water re-
sources  today,  including  climate  change.  The  systems  themselves  are  also  based  on
antiquated once-through treatment notions and are inconsistent with current think-
ing  about  maintaining  and  restoring  hydrology.  There  should  be  funding  for  other
agencies’  research  as  well,  however,  to  focus  on  the  particular  ways  in  which  the
activities they regulate affect and are affected by water resources. I know that EPA
participates  in  other  multi-agency  research  efforts,  but  am  not  familiar  with  the
structure of those efforts myself.
Q3. Your  testimony  did  not  include  a  separate  recommendation  for  funding  for
USGS to conduct the two main water-quality monitoring programs it is respon-
sible for. What would be an appropriate funding level for those programs?

A3. The most recent information I have been able to find suggests a need for a $70
million budget for NAWQA and a $30 million budget for the USGS toxics program.
The  $70  million  is  essential  to  restore  long-term  trend  monitoring  at  river  and
stream  sites.  A  letter  that  NRDC  recently  sent  to  Congress  on  the  NAWQA  budget
is attached. This is one of the most important projects of NAWQA since most moni-
toring  is  not  long-term  and  is  not  systematic  enough  to  provide  trend  data.  Simi-
larly,  $30  million  are  needed  for  the  Toxics  program  to  regain  the  strength  that  it
reached  in  the  1990s.  The  program  investigates  emerging  issues  and  develops  the
methods  and  protocols  for  sampling  and  analysis  for  chemicals  as  they  come  into
use.  The  program  is  essential  to  developing  the  data  to  investigate  new  issues  and
problems that are uncovered. I urge you to provide sufficient funding that NAWQA
can continue both surface and groundwater trend data for as many monitoring sta-
tions as it has.
Q4. You mention intense rain events not being of help but rather delivering too much
water at once. How can we adapt and manage intense rain events so as to cap-
ture the water for a beneficial purpose? What technologies and tools could be de-
veloped to farther such a goal?

A4. I  recently  testified  in  House  Transportation  and  Infrastructure’s  Subcommittee
on  Water  Resources  and  Environment  concerning  ‘‘Efforts  to  Address  Urban
Stormwater  Runoff.’’  I  have  attached  excerpts  from  my  testimony,  which  provide  a
detailed response to your question about strategies for managing rainfall.

Background

Many  communities,  ranging  from  highly  developed  cities  to  newly  developing
towns, are looking for ways to assure that their rivers, streams, lakes, and estuaries
are  protected  from  the  impacts  of  urbanization  and  climate  change.  Traditional  de-
velopment  practices  cover  large  areas  of  the  ground  with  impervious  surfaces  such
as roads, driveways, and buildings. Once such development occurs, rainwater cannot
infiltrate  into  the  ground,  but  rather  runs  off  site  at  levels  that  are  much  higher
than  would  naturally  occur.  The  collective  force  of  all  such  rainwater  scours
streams,  erodes  stream  banks,  and  causes  large  quantities  of  sediment  and  other
pollutants to enter the waterbody each time it rains.

The  last  few  decades  of  wet  weather  management  have  resulted  in  the  current
convention  of  control  and  treatment,  strategies  that  are  largely  hard  infrastructure
engineered,  end-of-pipe,  and  site-focused  practices  concerned  primarily  with  peak
flow  rate  and  suspended  solids  concentrations  and  other  pollutant  control.  Conven-
tional  practices,  however,  fail  to  address  the  widespread  and  cumulative  hydrologic
modifications  within  the  watershed,  including  increased  stormwater  volumes  and
runoff  rates,  excessive  erosion  and  stream  channel  degradation,  and  decreased
groundwater recharge.

While  this  approach  works  to  drain  each  site,  continued  expansion  of  dispersed,
low-density developments over the past years means that too much water, carrying
too  much  pollution,  is  flowing  into  waterways.  The  results  are  poor  water  quality,
especially  at  drain  outlets,  and  a  dramatic  drop  in  the  refill  rate  of  aquifers  and
streams. The 20 regions in the country that developed the most land over the period
1982  to  1997  now  lose  between  300  and  690  billion  gallons  of  water  annually  that
would  otherwise  have  filtered  through  the  Earth  and  been  captured  as  ground-
water.1

In  addition  to  the  problems  caused  by  stormwater  and  non-point  source  runoff,
many  older  cities  (including  many  of  the  largest  cities  in  the  United  States),  have
combined  sewage  and  stormwater  pipes  which  periodically  and  in  some  cases  fre-
quently  overflow  due  to  precipitation  events.  In  the  late  20th  century,  most  cities
that attempted to reduce sewer overflows did so by separating combined sewers, ex-
panding treatment capacity or storage within the sewer system, or by replacing bro-
ken  or  decaying  pipes.  However,  these  traditional  practices  can  be  enormously  ex-
pensive  and  take  decades  to  implement.  Moreover,  piped  stormwater  and  combined
sewer overflows (‘‘CSOs’’) may also in some cases have the adverse effects of upset-
ting the hydrological balance by moving water out of the watershed, thus bypassing
local streams and groundwater. Many of these events also have adverse impacts and
costs on source water for municipal drinking water utilities.

Climate change is already stressing aquatic ecosystems, infrastructure, and water
supplies.  While  impacts  vary  regionally,  in  much  of  the  U.S.,  more  frequent  heavy
rainfall  events  overload  the  capacity  of  sewer  systems  and  water  and  wastewater
treatment  plants,  as  well  as  result  in  more  stormwater  runoff,  exacerbating  water
pollution  from  sediments,  nutrients,  pathogens,  pesticides,  and  other  pollutants.  In
addition, decreased summer precipitation and other changes to the volume and tim-
ing  of  flows  reduce  stored  water  in  reservoirs  and  reduce  groundwater  levels.  Sea-
level  rise  will  adversely  affect  groundwater  by  causing  an  increase  in  the  intrusion
of  salt  water  into  coastal  aquifers.  All  of  these  impacts  will  make  less  freshwater
available for human use.

To  ameliorate  these  problems,  a  set  of  techniques,  approaches  and  practices  can
be  used  to  eliminate  or  reduce  the  amount  of  water  and  pollutants  that  run  off  a
site and ultimately are discharged into adjacent waterbodies. We refer to these col-
lectively  as  ‘‘green  infrastructure.’’  As  cities  move  towards  sustainable  infrastruc-
ture, green infrastructure can be a valuable approach.

‘‘Green infrastructure’’ is a relatively new and flexible term, and it has been used
differently  in  different  contexts.  Thus,  to  date,  there  is  no  universally  established
definition  of  the  term.  For  example,  some  writers  have  defined  it  broadly  as  ‘‘an
interconnected  system  of  natural  areas  and  other  open  spaces  that  conserves  nat-
ural  ecosystem  values  and  functions,  sustains  clean  air  and  water,  and  provides  a
wide array of benefits to people and wildlife.’’ 2 The Green Infrastructure Statement
of Intent signed by U.S. EPA, NRDC, the Low Impact Development Center, the Na-
tional  Association  of  Clean  Water  Agencies  (NACWA)  and  the  Association  of  State
and  Interstate  Water  Pollution  Control  Administrators  (ASWIPCA)  uses  the  term
‘‘green infrastructure’’ to generally refer to systems and practices that use or mimic
natural  processes  to  infiltrate,  evapotranspirate  (the  return  of  water  to  the  atmos-
phere  either  through  evaporation  or  by  plants),  or  re-use  stormwater  or  runoff  on
the site where it is generated.3

What Is Green Infrastructure?

Green  infrastructure  involves  management  approaches  and  technologies  that  uti-
lize,  enhance  and/or  mimic  the  natural  hydrologic  cycle  processes  of  infiltration,
evapotranspiration and re-use. Green infrastructure is the use of soil, trees, vegeta-
tion,  and  wetlands  and  open  space  (either  preserved  or  created)  in  urban  areas  to
capture  rain  while  enhancing  wastewater  and  stormwater  treatment.  Green  infra-

structure approaches currently in use include green roofs, trees and tree boxes, rain
gardens,  vegetated  swales,  pocket  wetlands,  infiltration  planters,  porous  and  per-
meable  pavements,  vegetated  median  strips,  reforestation/revegetation,  and  protec-
tion  and  enhancement  of  riparian  buffers  and  floodplains.  Green  infrastructure  can
be  used  almost  anywhere  soil  and  vegetation  can  be  harnessed  or  worked  into  the
urban or suburban landscape. Green infrastructure also includes decentralized rain-
water harvesting approaches, such as the use of rain barrels and cisterns to capture
and  re-use  rainfall  for  watering  plants  or  flushing  toilets.  These  approaches  can  be
used  to  keep  rainwater  out  of  the  sewer  system  so  that  it  does  not  contribute  to
a  sewer  overflow  and  also  to  reduce  the  amount  of  untreated  runoff  discharging  to
surface  waters.  Green  infrastructure  also  allows  stormwater  to  be  absorbed  and
cleansed  by  soil  and  vegetation  and  either  re-used  or  allowed  to  flow  back  into
groundwater or surface water resources.

Green Infrastructure Benefits4

Green infrastructure has a number of environmental and economic benefits in ad-

dition to reducing sewer overflows and stormwater discharges, including:

• Cleaner Water—Vegetation, green space and water re-use reduce the volumes
of stormwater runoff and, in combined systems, the volume of combined sewer
overflows,  as  well  as  reduce  concentrations  of  pollutants  in  those  discharges.
• Enhanced  Water  Supplies—Most  green  infiltration  approaches  involve  allow-
ing  stormwater  to  percolate  through  the  soil  where  it  recharges  the  ground-
water  and  the  base  flow  for  streams,  thus  ensuring  adequate  water  supplies
for  humans  and  more  stable  aquatic  ecosystems.  In  addition,  capturing  and
using stormwater conserves water supplies.

• Reduced fooding—Green infrastructure both controls surface flooding and sta-

bilizes the hydrology so that peak stream flows are reduced.

• Cleaner  Air—Trees  and  vegetation  improve  air  quality  by  filtering  many  air-
borne pollutants and can help reduce the amount of respiratory illness. Green
infrastructure  approaches  that  facilitate  shorter  commute  distances  and  the
ability to walk to destinations also reduce vehicle emissions.

• Reduced  Urban  Temperatures—Summer  city  temperatures  can  average  10°F
higher  than  nearby  suburban  temperatures.  High  temperatures  are  also
linked to higher ground level ozone concentrations. Vegetation creates shade,
reduces  the  amount  of  heat  absorbing  materials  and  emits  water  vapor—all
of  which  cool  hot  air.  Limiting  impervious  surface,  using  light  colored  imper-
vious surfaces (e.g., porous concrete), and vegetating roofs also mitigate urban
temperatures.

• Moderated  Impacts  of  Climate  Change—Climate  change  impacts  and  effects
vary regionally, but green infrastructure techniques provide adaptation bene-
fits for a wide array of circumstances, by conserving and re-using water, pro-
moting  groundwater  recharge,  reducing  surface  water  discharges  that  could
contribute  to  flooding.  In  addition,  there  are  mitigation  benefits  such  as  re-
duced energy demands and carbon sequestration by vegetation.

• Increased  Energy  Efficiency—Green  space  helps  lower  ambient  temperatures
and,  when  incorporated  on  and  around  buildings,  helps  shade  and  insulate
buildings  from  wide  temperature  swings,  decreasing  the  energy  needed  for
heating  and  cooling.  Also  energy  use  associated  with  pumping  and  treating
is  reduced  as  stormwater  is  diverted  from  wastewater  collection,  conveyance
and  treatment  systems.  Energy  efficiency  not  only  reduces  costs,  but  also  re-
duces generation of greenhouse gases.

• Source Water Protection—Green infrastructure practices provide pollutant re-
moval  benefits,  thereby  providing  some  protection  for  both  ground  water  and
surface water sources of drinking water. In addition, green infrastructure pro-
vides  groundwater  recharge  benefits  by  putting  stormwater  back  into  the
ground  and  enhances  surface  water  quality  by  redirecting  the  high  volume
and velocity flows that scour streams and muddy drinking water sources.

• Wildlife Habitat—Stream buffers, wetlands, parks, meadows, green roofs, and

rain gardens increase biodiversity within the urban environment.

• Community Benefits—Trees and plants improve urban aesthetics and commu-
nity livability by providing recreational and wildlife areas. Studies show that

property  values  are  higher,  homes,  sells  faster,  and  crime  is  reduced  when
trees and other vegetation are present.
• Health  Benefits—Studies  show  that  people  who  have  access  to  green  infra-
structure in their communities get more exercise, live longer, and report bet-
ter  health  in  general.  Exposure  to  green  infrastructure  (even  through  a  win-
dow)  improves  mental  functioning,  reduces  stress,  and  reduces  recovery  time
from surgery.
• Green  Jobs—Designing,  installing,  and  maintaining  green  infrastructure  cre-
ates new jobs for architects, designers, engineers, construction workers, main-
tenance workers, plumbers, landscapers, nurseries, etc.
• Cost  Savings—Green  infrastructure  saves  capital  costs  associated  with  pav-
ing,  curb  and  gutter,  building  large  collection  and  conveyance  systems,  and
digging big tunnels and centralized stormwater ponds; operations and mainte-
nance expenses for treatment plants, pumping stations, pipes, and other hard
infrastructure; energy costs for pumping water around; cost of treatment dur-
ing  wet  weather;  and  costs  of  repairing  the  damage  caused  by  stormwater,
such as streambank restoration.

In terms of the technologies and tools that need to be developed, there are several
very  important  areas  for  federal  investment  in  my  view.  First,  I’d  suggest  funding
watershed,  sub-watershed,  or  sewershed  level  investment  in  green  infrastructure
with  monitoring  to  evaluate  results.  Most  of  the  performance  data  is  at  the  site
level,  not  aggregated  at  the  watershed  or  sewershed  level.  There  are  models  avail-
able to predict results in an aggregated fashion, but those models need both refine-
ment and validation with actual monitoring results. Second, we need investment in
alternative  ways  to  use  water.  All  water  is  valuable.  None  of  it  is  really  ‘‘waste-
water,’’ as it has been called in the past, but waters of differing qualities are needed
for  different  uses.  More  research  is  needed  into  the  alternative  methods  of  deliv-
ering  water  for  beneficial  use/re-use.  and  the  associated  risks  and  environmental
and  economic  benefits  (hydrology,  cost  savings,  energy,  greenhouse  gas  emissions,
etc.) that can be achieved.

Questions by Representative Bob Inglis
Q1. Based  on  our  experiences  in  the  last  l0  years  or  so,  there  is  a  growing  concern
about  the  effectiveness  of  interagency  collaborative  efforts.  Although  some  have
been successful situations such as the one we have been witnessing in the multi-
agency satellite programs with NOAA, Air Force and NASA had made us a little
wary of such endeavors. Does the NRDC have any recommendations that would
help us strengthen this legislation such that the National Water Research initia-
tive does not devolve into another turf war?

A1. Legislating culture is very difficult as your question suggests. I would urge you
to consider structures that enable agencies to advocate for good research topics and
specific  projects  irrespective  of  whether  they  are  housed  in  that  agency.  My  under-
standing is that DOD and the VA have a Joint Incentive Fund that follows this ap-
proach. Each agency contributes a specified amount of funding to the joint fund each
year,  then  a  committee  consisting  of  members  of  both  agencies  select  the  projects
to  be  funded.  While  nothing  is  perfect,  a  similar  structure  would  be  beneficial  in
providing agency representatives with incentives to think big picture about what re-
search is really needed. Another possibility would be to have a standing Federal Ad-
visory Committee to provide recommendations to the Federal Government about re-
search needs.
Q2. Do  you  believe  that  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy  is  best  suited
to  lead  this  interagency  effort  or  would  another  agency,  such  as  EPA,  be  better
situated based on their past work in water research?

A2. It is preferable to have the White House chair an interagency effort such as this
one  to  provide  oversight  and  management.  Either  CEQ  or  OST  could  provide  such
oversight, and I am not sure which would be better in thisinstance.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Christine  Furstoss,  General  Manager  of  Technology,  GE  Water  and

Process Technologies, General Electric Company

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. Ms.  Furstoss,  we  have  heard  in  previous  hearings  that  water-related  R&D  can

lead to new opportunities for U.S. companies instead of foreign ones.

Q1a. Would you regard this as an accurate statement?
A1a. Yes.
Q1b. Would  foreign  companies’  access  to  U.S.  research  through  databases  such  as

RADIUS negate this advantage?

A1b. My  personal  opinion  is  that  there  can  be  many  levels  of  databases.  While  a
community  of  global  innovators  should  have  access  to  fundamental  information  to
promote sharing and collaboration, access to databases containing detailed informa-
tion on U.S. research and development priorities and results does have the potential
to  reduce  domestic  competitiveness.  By  knowing  specifics  behind  what  is  being
worked,  and,  very  importantly,  what  areas  may  not  be  competitive  and/or  what
major  issues  are  in  approaches,  then  an  open  database  containing  that  information
would allow any company to know where they can focus and who the major players
are.
Q1c. Do  you  gain  new  opportunities  by  research  conducted  in  other  countries,  such

as Israel?

A1c. GE  believes,  that  when  appropriate,  partnering  with  organizations  that  are
leaders in technology is beneficial to both sides. When countries, either through ini-
tiatives,  incentives,  or  priorities,  encourages  research  of  its  companies,  research  in-
stitutes  and  universities  to  be  focused  in  a  particular  area,  then  it  is  natural  that
the likelihood of increased innovation and breakthrough technology is increased. We
have seen such an example in Israel, where many small companies have made large
strides in thinking about water treatment and re-use in new ways. Interactions with
such  companies  have  been  beneficial,  not  only  from  a  potential  partnership  oppor-
tunity, but also in making us think differently about approaches.
Q1d. In  GE’s  experience,  how  would  you  define  the  efforts  of  other  industrialized

countries in the area of water research?

A1d. In  my  experience  and  knowledge,  efforts  of  other  industrialized  countries  in
water research is by-and-large in its infancy relative to other technical fields. While
some  countries  such  as  Singapore,  Israel,  western  Canada  and  various  entities
across the Middle East have made water research a priority, others are still looking
to  universities,  research  organizations  and  private  industry  to  lead  the  charge.  I
have  not  encountered  any  entities  that  have  discouraged  this  area  of  research;  it
is  more  a  matter  of  priority  and  focus  to  drive  rapid  advancement.  That  is  why  I
am encouraged by this bill, and the discussion of including multiple types of organi-
zations to participate as part of it. In that way, a community with shared goals and
priorities, as well as increased sharing and speed of discovery will emerge.
Q1e. Does  GE  participate  in  collaborative  efforts  with  either  foreign  companies  or
other  governments  in  order  to  develop  the  appropriate  or  necessary  water  re-
search? How about for development of technologies?

A1e. GE  has  participated  in  efforts  ranging  from  advisory  discussions  on  broad
councils  sponsored  by  governments,  to  partnering  with  government  agencies  and
country  university  systems  on  water  treatment  research  and  technology  develop-
ment. GE Water is also working with several large multinational companies to help
address water issues and reduce their water footprint; one example is GE’s relation-
ship  with  ConocoPhillips  in  developing  a  Water  Sustainability  Center  in  Doha,
Qatar. Similarly, we have relationships with major corporate multi-nationals in the
food  processing  area,  and  large  power  companies  where  we  are  working  to  reduce
their water consumption and help re-use their waste water.
Q2. How  would  you  address  the  assertion  by  Mr.  Modzelewski  that  corporate  R&D

investment is low despite the importance of water to life?

A2. I  would  agree  with  that  statement,  but  have  been  encouraged  over  the  past
year in the attention being paid in this area. There are many small companies and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:01 Aug 30, 2009 Jkt 047553 PO 00000 Frm 00074 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\FULL09\030409\47553 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

71

start-up companies that have good ideas to help reduce the cost of water treatment,
and treat more water problems.
Q3. The legislation before us today calls for an establishment of an interagency com-
mittee as well as an advisory board to such committee to work on water resource
issues  including  technology  and  research.  What  role  would  you  envision  for  the
private  sector  in  working  with  these  entities?  How  would  an  Interagency  Com-
mittee  use  the  knowledge  and  expertise  residing  in  American  industry  groups
and non-governmental organizations?

A3. These  groups  should  be  smaller  and  focused  on  the  task  at-hand.  If  the  panels
become  too  large,  they  can  have  difficulty  rapidly  developing  and  deploying  tech-
nology.  Industry  focuses  on  the  ‘‘voice  of  the  customer’’  every  day,  understanding
how to bring technology to the market effectively and efficiently.
Q4. The  legislation  includes  an  advisory  board  for  the  interagency  committee  on

water resources. Who would you recommend be included on such a board?

A4. In addition to government officials, industry groups and academia, I would rec-
ommend  a  Chief  Technology  Officer  from  industry,  as  well  as  industry  representa-
tives who are used to rapidly developing and deploying technology.
Q5. There has been a great deal of discussion in the past few years regarding effects
of  climate  change  on  water  supplies.  Is  GE  exploring  any  adaptation  strategies
to address these effects?

A5. GE is investing in technologies that will assist in water-stressed areas, such as
brackish  water  treatment/desalination  and  advanced  technologies  to  enable  signifi-
cant increases in water re-use and recycling.
Q6. What  improvements  could  be  made  to  this  legislation  to  ensure  it  results  in  the
research  and  development  necessary  for  technology  development?  What  areas  of
water  R&D  are  most  in  need  of  further  attention  that  would  allow  industry  to
develop new types of technologies? Are there any technology pathways right now
that are closed off due to the lack of basic R&D?

A6. In  my  opinion,  there  are  several  companies  with  good  viable  products  that  can
help  reduce  the  cost  of  water  treatment.  These  companies  can  make  impact  on  en-
ergy  costs,  operational  costs,  and  capital  costs.  The  risk  and  cost  to  bring  a  tech-
nology from lab to industrial application can be very prohibitive. I feel that govern-
ment  support  or  center(s)  that  focused  on  scale-up  of  technologies  and  field  testing
with  representative  water  chemistries,  flows  and  variability  would  greatly  enhance
the  state  of  the  industry  development.  While  difficult  to  single  out  any  one  tech-
nology area most in need or closed off, the difficulty in taking innovations from lab
to application is currently a bottleneck in fast-tracking the application of novel tech-
nologies.
Q7. Has  GE  done  any  comprehensive  mapping  of  available  water  resources  in  the

U.S. or other countries?

A7. GE  has  contributed  to,  and  utilized,  water  availability  and  quality  maps  that
have  been  produced  and  published  by  global  research  and  consulting  entities.  We
have not done exhaustive mapping on our own.

Questions submitted by Representative Adrian Smith
Q1. How much interaction does GE have with local and regional managers and deci-
sion-makers?  Has  this  type  of  interaction  driven  technology  development  to  ad-
dress particular concerns?

A1. I  believe  that  we  have  a  great  deal  of  interaction;  we  have  been  working  with
local  and  regional  decision-makers  at  the  State  level  on  a  state-by-state  basis,  as
well  as  regional  water  authorities.  GE  believes  that  this  type  of  engagement  is  es-
sential to understanding the types of challenges that communities are facing across
the Nation. GE is also open to working with communities to collaboratively develop
solutions  that  meet  both  their  treatment  and  cost  needs.  Collaborations  that  we
have  with  entities  such  as  New  Mexico  State  University,  which  is  intimately  tied
to  many  decision-makers,  are  key  to  both  our  understanding  of  not  only  the  needs,
but how communities need to make decisions (their drivers, priorities, and critically,
their  ‘‘boundaries’’—what  they  can  and  can’t  do  and  afford).  This  greatly  helps  us
prioritize and more fully understand technology needs.

Questions submitted by Representative Dana Rohrabacher
Q1. In  your  testimony,  you  indicate  that  GE  scientists  and  researchers  have  been  at
the forefront of developing many new technologies in the areas of water conserva-
tion  and  use  as  well  as  a  number  of  other  areas.  What  incentives  exist  for  GE
to  continue  to  explore  these  areas?  Are  there  any  additional  incentives  you  be-
lieve would encourage companies to explore these areas?

A1. As  regulations  on  water  quality,  discharge  and  re-use  emerge,  GE  feels  that
being  able  to  provide  a  portfolio  of  solutions  for  customers  to  choose  from  to  meet
their  complex  needs  is  a  sound  strategy.  To  my  knowledge,  there  are  no  direct  in-
centives directly related to technology investment. There are multiple funding agen-
cies with water programs, and GE is participating in a few of them. These programs
greatly  help  us  accelerate  our  activities,  as  well  as  explore  more  approaches  and
areas.  Going  forward,  in  my  opinion,  having  a  more  unified  set  of  priorities  across
agencies with larger programs available for participation, will allow more companies
to  participate,  or  participate  at  an  enhanced  level,  for  they  will  understand  how
these  activities  fit  into  policy  and  future  directions.  I  also  personally  feel  that  hav-
ing more focus on industry standards on measurements for regulatory requirements
on water quality is a wise investment—many contaminants and discharge limits can
be  measured  in  a  variety  of  ways  (or  not  measured  reliably  today).  Clarity  in  this
area will help all.
Q2. GE is a global company and as such must be aware of global trends in research
and  development.  Which  countries  do  you  believe  are  ahead  of  the  US  in  this
area? What steps have these countries taken to improve water quality or be more
efficient  in  their  use  of  water?  Can  any  of  these  strategies  be  adapted  for  use
in the United States?

A2. I feel that Israel has encouraged companies to invest in water technologies, and
that has led to some unique innovation. Singapore encourages water research to be
conducted  there,  and  initiatives  to  develop  fundamental  technologies  to  reduce  en-
ergy  consumption  in  water  treatment  and  also  reduce  the  cost  of  water  treatment.
Various  entities  in  the  Middle  East  are  encouraging  companies  to  work  with  them
on  systems  and  pilots  that  are  novel  in  their  approach  to  working  with  impaired
waters.  Finally,  the  Alberta  government,  due  to  their  water  challenges,  is  spon-
soring  joint  industry-university-agency  research  that  includes  pilot  testing.  These
entities  have  clearly  identified  their  priorities  and  participated  in  forming  relation-
ships  to  help  drive  technology  in  focused  areas.  I  personally  feel  that  a  prioritized
agenda  that  all  parties  can  work  toward,  as  well  as  support  of  scale-up/piloting  fa-
cilities would be beneficial for the water community.

SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF

H.R. 1145, THE NATIONAL WATER RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE ACT

Title: National Water Research and Development Initiative Act
Purpose:  To  improve  the  Federal  Government’s  role  in  water  research,  develop-
ment,  demonstration,  data  collection,  education,  and  technology  transfer  activities
to address changes in water use, supply, and demand in the United States.

Section 1: Short Title

The National Water Research and Development Initiative Act of 2009

Section 2: National Water Research and Development Initiative

Section 2 directs the President to implement a National Water Research and De-
velopment  Initiative  to  improve  federal  activities  on  water,  including:  research,  de-
velopment,  demonstration,  data  collection  and  dissemination,  education,  and  tech-
nology  transfer.  As  part  of  the  Initiative,  the  President  shall  establish  or  designate
an  Interagency  Committee  with  representation  from  all  federal  agencies  dealing
with  water  and  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget.  The  Office  of  Science  and
Technology Policy will chair the Committee.

The  Committee  is  charged  with  developing  a  National  Water  Availability  Re-
search  and  Assessment  Plan,  coordinating  all  federal  activities  on  water  that  in-
clude research, development, demonstration, data collection and dissemination, edu-
cation, and technology transfer, and promoting cooperation among agencies with re-
spect  to  water  research.  The  Committee  is  also  responsible  for  facilitating  tech-
nology  transfer,  communication,  and  opportunities  for  exchange  with  non-govern-
mental organizations.

The President is directed to create a National Water Initiative Coordination Office
to  provide  technical  and  administrative  support  to  the  Committee.  The  Office  will
disseminate information to the public and serve as a point of contact for the Initia-
tive.

The  National  Water  Research  and  Assessment  Plan  establishes  priorities  for  fed-
eral  water  research  and  assessment  and  shall  utilize  the  recommendation  from  a
2007  Report  issued  by  SWAQ  (Subcommittee  on  Water  Availability  and  Quality  of
the National Science and Technology Council) and recommendations by the National
Academy of Sciences. This section also identifies required elements of the Plan. The
Plan lists a number of water research outcomes to be achieved by the agencies par-
ticipating in the Initiative.

The  Plan  will  be  subject  to  a  90-day  public  comment  period  and  must  be  sub-

mitted to Congress within one year of enactment.

Section  2  also  requires  the  President  to  establish  or  designate  an  advisory  com-
mittee  including  non-governmental  experts  to  provide  guidance  and  recommenda-
tions to the interagency committee governing the Initiative.

Section 3: Budget Coordination

Section  3  directs  the  President  to  provide  guidance  to  each  federal  agency  in  the
Initiative  with  respect  to  the  President’s  annual  budget  request.  The  President  is
required  to  describe  and  list  the  items  in  the  request  that  are  intended  to  achieve
the outcomes of the Plan.

Section 4: Annual Report

Section  4  directs  the  President  submit  an  annual  report  to  Congress  describing

the activities and results of the Initiative.
