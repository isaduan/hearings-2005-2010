U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Establishing the Advanced Research
Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA–E) —

H.R. 364

THURSDAY, APRIL 26, 2007

2:00 P.M.–4:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On Thursday, April 26, 2007 the House Committee on Science & Technology, Sub-
committee  on  Energy  and  Environment  will  hold  a  hearing  to  receive  testimony  on
H.R. 364, Establishing an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy.

Chairman  Gordon  introduced  H.R.  364  on  January  10,  2007.  H.R.  364  follows  on
the  recommendation  of  the  National  Academies  of  Science  report,  Rising  Above  the
Gathering  Storm,  which  called  for  establishing  a  new  energy  research  and  tech-
nology  development  agency  within  Department  of  Energy  patterned  after  the  suc-
cessful  Defense  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency  (DARPA)  within  the  Depart-
ment  of  Defense.  H.R.  364  establishes  such  an  agency,  known  as  the  Advanced  Re-
search Projects Agency for Energy, or ARPA–E.

This hearing will seek to address the following issues relating to H.R. 364:

• What are the limitations of the current energy R&D enterprise in addressing
the  most  pressing  energy-related  challenges?  Is  ARPA–E  as  laid  out  in  H.R.
364 structured to address these limitations?

• Which areas of energy research should be explored by ARPA–E?
• What  organizational  elements  of  DARPA  make  it  an  attractive  model  for  en-
ergy  research  and  technology  development?  Are  there  advantages  and  draw-
backs  of  other  organizational  models  that  should  be  examined  in  developing
an ARPA–E?

• Does  the  level  of  investment  prescribed  in  H.R.  364  match  the  magnitude  of

challenges in energy research and development?

Background

H.R.  364  establishes  the  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency–Energy  (ARPA–E),
and  sets  up  an  Energy  Independence  Acceleration  Fund  to  conduct  activities  under
the  Act.  H.R.  364  was  first  introduced  as  H.R.  4435  in  the  109th  Congress.  In  the
109th  Congress  the  House  Committee  on  Science  held  a  hearing  on  March  9,  2006
examining the concept of an ARPA–E (HOUSE REPT. 109–39). H.R. 364 follows on
the recommendation of the National Academies 2005 report, Rising Above the Gath-
ering  Storm,  also  known  as  the  ‘‘Augustine  Report’’  for  its  chair,  retired  Lockheed
Martin  CEO  Norman  Augustine.  This  report  called  on  the  Federal  Government  to
create  a  new  energy  research  agency  within  Department  of  Energy  patterned  after
the successful Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) within the De-
partment  of  Defense.  Several  similar  bills  calling  for  an  ARPA–E  have  since  been
introduced in both the House and Senate (including S. 696 and S. 761).

According to the Gathering Storm report, ARPA–E should be structured to ‘‘spon-
sor creative, out-of-the-box, transformational, generic energy research in those areas
where  industry  itself  cannot  or  will  not  undertake  such  sponsorships,  where  risks
and  potential  payoffs  are  high,  and  where  success  could  provide  dramatic  benefits
for  the  Nation.  ARPA–E  would  accelerate  the  process  by  which  research  is  trans-
formed  to  address  economic,  environmental,  and  security  issues.  It  would  be  de-
signed  as  a  lean,  effective,  and  agile—but  largely  independent—organization  that
can  start  and  stop  targeted  programs  based  on  performance  and  ultimate  rel-
evance.’’

The  primary  motivations  for  establishing  an  ARPA–E  are  the  need  for  the  U.S.
to obtain more energy from domestic sources, become more energy efficient, and be-
come less reliant on energy sources and technologies that have an adverse effect on
the  environment.  The  drive  for  new  technologies  is  especially  urgent  given  the  geo-
political  forces  that  threaten  global  energy  supplies  and  economic  stability,  the
looming  threat  of  global  climate  change,  and  probable  regulation  of  carbon  dioxide
emissions.  In  addition  to  addressing  the  Nation’s  energy  challenges,  the  Gathering
Storm report concluded that ARPA–E should also contribute to U.S. competitiveness
by  playing  an  important  role  in  ‘‘advancing  research  in  engineering,  the  physical
sciences,  and  mathematics;  and  in  developing  the  next  generation  of  researchers.’’
ARPA–E is intended to pursue energy research and technology development with
a structure that is fundamentally different from the traditional energy research en-
terprise.  Critics  of  the  Department  of  Energy’s  management  of  research  programs
contend that the stove-piped and bureaucratic structure of DOE is not conducive to
quickly  developing  cross-cutting  energy  solutions,  or  translating  energy  research
into  commercial  technologies.  ARPA–E  will  instead  have  a  relatively  flat  organiza-
tion,  similar  to  the  small,  flexible,  non-hierarchical  reporting  structure  at  DARPA
that  fostered  a  successful  culture  of  innovation.  Furthermore,  because  the  director
of  ARPA–E  reports  directly  to  the  Secretary  of  Energy,  as  is  written  in  H.R.  364,
it is not beholden to any one particular technology area or research program within
DOE.  To  further  insulate  ARPA–E  from  bureaucratic  impediments,  some  stake-
holders  have  suggested  that  ARPA–E  should  not  be  housed  within  DOE  at  all,  but
may be more appropriate as an independent government corporation which can still
choose to fund projects within DOE.

ARPA–E’s  unique  role  is  best  described  as  a  ‘‘marriage  broker’’  that  can  identify
people and capabilities within industry, universities, and the national labs, and put
them together in hybrid teams, coordinate research, and quickly develop novel solu-
tions to pressing energy problems. Key to this function is the program manager. As
with  DARPA,  these  individuals  would  ostensibly  be  very  talented,  knowledgeable,
experienced  in  industry,  and  passionate  in  pursuing  their  mission.  Because  of  the
flexible  hiring  authority  that  is  written  into  Section  2  of  the  bill,  talented  program
managers can be recruited from a variety of fields and experiences, hired for a term
of approximately 2–5 years, and paid a salary commensurate with what they would
make  in  the  private  sector.  Program  managers  and  their  superiors  are  given  ex-
traordinary  freedoms  and  resources  to  pursue  technologies  quickly,  as  well  as  free-
dom to just as quickly stop research if it does not look fruitful. This is probably the
biggest departure from the current DOE model.

There  is  some  disagreement  on  which  stage  of  research  and  development  ARPA–
E  should  be  focused—early  stage  basic  research,  or  late  stage  demonstrations  and
commercial applications. This assumes that one is exclusive of the other, as is usu-
ally  the  case  in  the  traditional  energy  R&D  enterprise.  However,  a  truly  mission-
driven  ARPA–E  will  leverage  its  resources  and  institutional  capabilities  to  pursue
multiple  stages  of  R&D  in  a  ‘‘whatever  it  takes’’  approach  to  moving  a  potentially
transformational  technology  from  the  laboratory  bench  to  the  marketplace.  If  ade-
quately  funded  and  directed,  ARPA–E  would  engage  in  basic  research  into  funda-
mental  concepts  with  possible  technology  applications,  and  later-stage  technology
prototyping and large-scale demonstrations.

Both critics and proponents of an ARPA–E agree that, for the program to be suc-
cessful,  it  must  be  funded  at  levels  to  match  the  magnitude  of  energy  challenges,
and the high costs of energy research and technology demonstration. Despite the re-
cent  attention  to  energy  challenges,  R&D  investment  in  energy  remains  far  below
the  historically  high  levels  of  the  1970’s.  A  recent  GAO  report  commissioned  by
Chairman Gordon and Congressman Honda noted that ‘‘DOE’s total budget author-
ity  for  energy  R&D  dropped  by  over  85  percent  (in  real  terms)  from  1978  to  2005,
peaking in the late 1970’s but falling sharply when oil prices returned to lower lev-
els in the mid-1980’s.’’ (GAO–07–106) Investment in ARPA–E should be seen in the
context  of  increasing  overall  energy  R&D  expenditures  enough  to  truly  address  the
challenge.  The  Gathering  Storm  report  calls  for  ARPA–E  to  be  authorized  at  $300
million  in  the  first  year,  and  quickly  escalate  to  $1  billion  within  five  years.  H.R.
364 currently has a similar funding profile. Some suggest that the only way a high-
cost, risk-tolerant program like ARPA–E would survive is if it has dedicated funding
of  some  kind,  and  therefore  would  not  be  subject  to  annual  appropriations  or  other
political/financial pressures and resource fluctuations that stifle innovation.

Chairwoman  GIFFORDS.  I  call  the  hearing  to  order.  Good  after-
noon,  everyone.  It  is  an  honor  to  be  here  today,  and  to  have  such
an  esteemed  panel  of  witnesses.  I  also  want  to  thank  Mr.  Chair-
man,  Bart  Gordon,  for  allowing  me  to  step  in  to  chair  the  Sub-
committee  hearing,  instead  of  Congressman  Nick  Lampson,  who
unfortunately,  is  not  with  us  right  now,  but  I  know  he  is
recuperating very quickly, and will be back with us soon.

We  are  here  today  to  discuss  H.R.  364,  the  bill  to  establish  an
Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency  for  Energy,  also  known  as
ARPA–E, introduced by Chairman Gordon earlier this year.

Despite passage of an Energy Bill in the 109th Congress, interest
in  energy,  its  production,  its  distribution,  and  its  use,  remain  in-
credibly  high.  This  is  because  we  have  not  yet  addressed  the  key
challenges  our  society  faces  that  are  linked  to  our  present  energy
sources and our present patterns of energy use.

We  want  to  reduce  our  dependence  on  foreign  sources  of  energy
to  ensure  our  economic  and  national  security,  and  to  improve  our
balance  of  trade.  We  also  need  to  address  the  environmental  con-
sequences  associated  with  the  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  from
fossil  fuel  use  that  have  initiated  the  global  warming  and  regional
climate changes that we are now all experiencing.

We must take steps to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, and
to diversify our energy sources. Part of that solution lies in getting
more of the alternative energy sources and technologies to improve
energy  efficiency  directly  and  immediately  into  the  marketplace.
But  we  must  also  make  a  greater  investment  in  research  and  de-
velopment  to  discover  and  to  develop  new  energy  sources,  new  en-
ergy-saving  technologies,  and  new  methods  of  reducing  carbon
emissions associated with fossil fuel use.

The investments that we must make must support a wide range
of  ideas,  and  foster  creative  thinking  that  will  develop  the  full
range  of  energy  technologies.  We  need  these  technologies  to  con-
tinue  to  support  a  vibrant  economy  and  the  quality  of  life  that  we
all enjoy today, and that is what H.R. 364 is all about.

My  home  State  of  Arizona,  that  I  like  to  talk  about  so  much,  is
rich  in  sunshine.  We  all  know  that.  And  solar  technology  has  the
potential  to  make  significant  contributions  to  our  available  energy
resources.  Within  the  last  two  years,  researchers  have  found  ways
to use polymers and nanoparticles to create solar cells that capture
infrared as well as visible light. With more efficient solar cells, sun-
shine-rich  states  like  Arizona  could  exchange  fossil  fuel-produced
electricity for electricity generated by clean, renewable solar power.
We  need  to  support  this  kind  of  creative  application  of
nanotechnology  to  energy  research  to  find  the  breakthroughs  that
will  yield  more  than  incremental  improvements  in  current  energy
technologies.  Also  at  the  University  of  Arizona  is  Professor  Roger
Angel,  who  is  doing  a  lot  of  innovative  research  on  optics,  using
this technology to harness solar technology.

One  of  the  recommendations  of  the  2006  National  Academy  of
Sciences  report,  Rising  Above  the  Gathering  Storm,  was  to  create
an  energy  projects  research  agency,  using  the  successful  model  of
the  Defense  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency,  DARPA,  that  we
are  all  very  familiar  with,  and  that  has  supplied  many  break-

through  technologies  in  the  areas  of  defense,  information  tech-
nologies, and communications, among other things.

Chairman Gordon has taken the National Academies’ advice, and
incorporated their recommendations into H.R. 364. We are pleased
to have a very knowledgeable and distinguished panel of witnesses
with  us  this  afternoon  to  offer  their  thoughts  on  the  ARPA–E  con-
cept,  and  on  how  H.R.  364  can  guide  our  efforts  to  achieve  our
goals of energy efficiency, fuel diversification, energy independence,
greater  economic  and  national  security,  and  environmental  protec-
tion.

Thank you all for being with us this afternoon. It is an honor to
have  you  here  in  this  subcommittee,  and  at  this  time,  I  will  yield
to the author of H.R. 364, Congressman, Chairman, Mr. Gordon.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE GABRIELLE GIFFORDS

Good  afternoon.  We  are  here  today  to  discuss  H.R.  364,  the  bill  to  establish  an
Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy—ARPA–E—introduced by Chairman
Gordon earlier this year.

Despite  passage  of  an  energy  bill  in  the  109th  Congress,  interest  in  energy—its
production,  its  distribution,  and  its  use  remain  high.  This  is  because  we  have  not
yet  addressed  the  key  challenges  our  society  faces  that  are  linked  to  our  present
energy sources and our present patterns of energy use.

We want to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy to ensure our eco-
nomic  and  national  security  and  to  improve  our  balance  of  trade.  We  also  need  to
address  the  environmental  consequences  associated  with  the  emissions  of  green-
house gases from fossil fuel use that have initiated the global warming and regional
climate changes we are now experiencing.

We  must  take  steps  to  reduce  our  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  to  diversify  our
energy  sources.  Part  of  the  solution  lies  in  getting  more  of  the  alternative  energy
sources and technologies to improve energy efficiency into the marketplace.

But we must also make a greater investment in research and development to dis-
cover  and  develop  new  energy  sources,  new  energy-saving  technologies,  and  new
methods  of  reducing  carbon  emissions  associated  with  fossil  fuel  use.  The  invest-
ments  we  make  must  support  a  wide  range  of  ideas  and  foster  creative  thinking
that  will  develop  the  full  range  of  energy  technologies  that  we  need  in  the  future
to  continue  supporting  a  vibrant  economy  and  the  quality  of  life  that  we  enjoy
today. That is what H.R. 364 is all about.

My home State of Arizona is rich in sunshine, and solar technology has the poten-
tial to make a significant contribution to our available energy resources. Within the
last  two  years,  researchers  have  found  ways  to  use  polymers  with  nanoparticles  to
create  solar  cells  that  capture  infrared  as  well  as  visible  light.  With  more  efficient
solar  cells,  sunshine-rich  states  like  Arizona  could  exchange  fossil  fuel  produced
electricity for electricity generated by clean, renewable solar energy.

We  need  to  support  this  type  of  creative  application  of  nanotechnology  to  energy
research  to  find  the  breakthroughs  that  will  yield  more  than  incremental  improve-
ments  in  current  energy  technologies.  Also,  at  the  University  of  Arizona,  Professor
Roger  Angel  is  doing  innovative  research  on  using  optics  to  harness  solar  energy.
One  of  the  recommendations  of  the  2006  National  Academy  of  Sciences  Report:
Rising Above the Gathering Storm was to create an energy projects research agency
using  the  successful  model  of  the  Defense  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency
(DARPA)  that  we  are  now  familiar  with  and  that  has  supplied  many  breakthrough
technologies in areas of defense and communications, among others. Chairman Gor-
don  has  taken  the  National  Academy’s  advice  and  incorporated  their  recommenda-
tion into H.R. 364.

We  are  pleased  to  have  a  very  knowledgeable  and  distinguished  panel  of  wit-
nesses  with  us  this  afternoon  to  offer  their  thoughts  on  the  ARPA–E  concept  and
on how H.R. 364 can guide our efforts to achieve our goals of energy efficiency, fuel
diversification,  energy  independence,  greater  economic  and  national  security,  and
environmental protection. Thank you all for appearing before the Subcommittee this
afternoon.

Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Chair Giffords. I knew you would

find a way to work Arizona into your statement.

Let  me  welcome,  very  warmly  welcome,  this  distinguished  panel
here  today.  As  I  mentioned  to  you  earlier,  this  is  sort  of  the  get-
away  day.  We  finished  votes  earlier,  and  folks  often  are  off  back
to their districts. That is, I guess, the bad news.

The  good  news  is  that  all  of  our  energy  staff  is  here,  and  quite
frankly,  you  are  better  off  talking  to  them  than  to  us  anyway.  So,
you  got  the  folks  here  that  are  the  most  important  in  developing
this bill. So, we very much appreciate you coming.

As we all know, so I won’t go into it but just a little bit, approxi-
mately  two  years  ago  the  former  Chairman  of  the  Science  Com-
mittee,  behind  you  there  on  the  wall,  Sherry  Boehlert,  myself,  as
Ranking  Member  at  that  time,  Lamar  Alexander,  and  Jeff  Binga-
man,  asked  the  National  Academies  to  do  a  report  on  competitive-
ness  of  America  in  the  21st  Century.  We  didn’t  like  the  news  they
gave  us,  but  it  was  realistic.  They  also  gave  us  some  good  sugges-
tions for the future.

Interestingly,  yesterday,  well,  earlier,  we  passed  unanimously
out of this committee the math and science recommendations. They
passed  almost  unanimously  on  the  floor  just  yesterday.  We  have
come out of Committee unanimously with the research suggestions,
in terms of increasing the amount of funding to NSF and NIST yes-
terday,  and  they  will  be  on  the  Floor  next  week.  And  so,  we  are
moving  forward,  but  this  is  an  important  piece  of  that.  The  other
piece  was,  I  won’t  say  energy  independence,  that  is  going  to  be  a
little much to ask for, but to reduce our dependency on foreign en-
ergy.

And ARPA–E was their suggestion. I unashamedly plagiarized it,
and  we  put  it  into  legislation  last  year.  We  reintroduced  it  this
year.  You  are  here  with  us  today  to  help  us  fine-tune  it,  to  make
it  as  good  a  bill  as  we  possibly  can,  because  it  is  very  important
for this country, and we thank you for being here.

Before  this  committee  hearing,  I  set  up  something  called  Call
Your Congressman. I sent out letters to about 85,000 homes to call
me these next two days, and so we have been doing that, and I am
going to have to go back and do some more of that.

One thing, and I am going to ask you something a little bit con-
troversial, as you give your input. We live in a pay-as-you-go world
now here in Congress, which makes things difficult. We would like
to  have  doubled  the  National  Science  Foundation  sooner  than  ten
years. We would like to have doubled NIST in a quicker time than
ten  years,  but  we  are  trying,  again,  we  are  on  a  pay-as-you-go
budget, so it is more difficult.

And  so,  we  have  to  think  in  those  terms,  and  one  of  the  things
that  I  would  like  to  give  some  thought  to  is  recoupment  of  some
of  the  funds.  And  I  know  that  probably  you  are  all,  in  all  likeli-
hood, going to be opposed to that one way or the other, but I think
that if we, in the political sense, thought almost of our investment
as  somewhat  of  a  revolving  fund  over  a  long  period  of  time,  it
would make it easier for us to get additional funds.

And  I  know  this  is  something  that  is  not  often  used,  and  maybe
Mr.  Denniston  will  speak  to  some  of  that.  Whether  there  could  be
a  way  to  structure  the  program  so  the  Federal  Government  could
take a share, maybe at the end. Don’t you wish we had a little bit

of  the  Internet?  We  wouldn’t  have  to  do  pay-as-you-go,  we  would
just, we would have it already.

But  the  point  is,  you  know,  is  there  a  way  to  structure  this  in
a  responsible  way  that  does  not  disincentivize  people  from  invest-
ing and getting involved in this? And that would help us, in a polit-
ical  sense,  make  it  more  palatable  to  put  more  dollars  in  up  front,
and it won’t be a completely revolving fund.

So, in my absence, I hope that, and you can all badmouth it, be-
cause  I  am  going  to  be  gone,  but  if  there  is  anything,  you  know,
if  there  is  a  way,  among  all  the  bad  stuff  that  you  might  think
about  how  we  might  do  that,  just  we  would  like  to  have  that  for
that information.

And  again,  we  welcome  you  all  here,  and  thank  you  for  joining

us, and I yield back my time.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BART GORDON

I  would  like  to  welcome  everyone  to  this  Energy  and  Environment  Subcommittee
hearing  on  my  bill,  H.R.  364  which  establishes  an  Advanced  Research  Projects
Agency for Energy.

I  would  also  like  to  thank  our  distinguished  panel  of  witnesses  for  testifying.  I
believe  your  perspectives  from  the  private  investment  and  university  communities,
and  your  experiences  with  DARPA  and  similar  technology  agencies  are  critical  to
developing  the  most  effective  ARPA–E  possible.  I  look  forward  to  your  testimony.
I first introduced this bill in the 109th Congress in response to recommendations
in the National Academies report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm, chaired by the
eminent Norm Augustine, former head of Lockheed Martin.

Along  with  Senators  Alexander  and  Bingaman  and  others,  I  requested  that  the
National Academies look into and report on the factors that threaten the U.S. global
competitiveness and our leadership in technological innovation.

In  addition  to  strengthening  our  education  and  research  system,  the  Gathering
Storm panel recognized that the U.S. dependence on traditional energy sources and
outdated technologies puts us in a perilous position.

Not  only  do  we  face  threats  to  our  national  security  and  economic  volatility  be-
cause  of  our  reliance  on  unstable  foreign  regimes  for  oil  and  gas,  we  now  must  ac-
knowledge that our energy use is directly tied to global climate change.

This is an untenable position, and it simply must change. Conservation is the first
element in addressing this challenge. But we must also be aggressive in developing
the next generation of technologies to get beyond our current energy paradigm.

The  Augustine  Commission  recommended  establishing  ARPA–E,  modeled
DARPA’s  successful  innovation  model,  to  sponsor  creative,  out-of-the-box,  trans-
formational  energy  research  in  those  areas  where  industry  by  itself  cannot  or  will
not undertake on it’s own.

DARPA  succeeded  largely  because  it  continued  to  foster  a  culture  of  innovation.
We  cannot  legislate  an  agency’s  culture.  But  we  can  provide  the  resources  and  the
institutional  structure  to  give  exceptionally  talented  people  the  opportunity  to  pur-
sue high-risk, but high-payoff energy research.

A  nimble  organization  with  minimal  administrative  layers  and  the  ability  to

quickly start and stop research programs is key to the success of ARPA–E.

As  imperative  as  it  is,  transforming  our  energy  economy  is  a  challenge  that  is
unfathomable  to  most  folks.  We  cannot  afford  to  wait  until  we  face  severe  disrup-
tions to fossil energy supplies or serious impacts from climate change to address this
challenge.

Federal investment in energy technology R&D is down 85 percent from the 1980’s.

We must reverse this trend.

Investment in ARPA–E must be seen as the first step in boosting energy research
and  development  to  a  level  that  addresses  the  scale  of  our  challenge,  and  the  true
cost of doing transformational research.

We  all  agree  that  energy  research  and  development  is  key  to  energy  independ-

ence, innovation, workforce development and saving the environment.

The  question  is  how  far  are  we  willing  to  go  to  enact  real  change  that  garners

tangible results?

Establishing  an  ARPA–E  in  H.R.  364  is  a  bold  step,  but  we’ve  got  to  be  willing

to push the envelope and think outside the box to get the job done.

I appreciate the Committee’s support, and look forward to the witness’ testimony.
Chairwoman  GIFFORDS.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Gordon.  At  this
time,  I  would  like  to  yield  to  our  distinguished  Ranking  Member,
Mr. Inglis, for an opening statement.

Mr.  INGLIS.  And  I  thank  the  Chair,  and  thank  the  Chairman  of
the  Full  Committee  for  holding  this  hearing  on  the  establishment
of an ARPA–E.

I think we share the same vision, America serving the world, and
succeeding  as  the  leading  technological  innovator.  We  also  share
the same goal, creating incentives for technology advancement. We
share  some  of  the  same  strategies  and  tactics  toward  the  attain-
ment of the goal and the fulfillment of that vision.

There  may  be  some  wisdom  in  setting  up  a  separate  federal
agency  within,  or  create  a  new  federal  agency  within  the  Depart-
ment  of  Energy  to  mimic  the  risk-embracing  and  entrepreneurial
activities  of  the  DARPA  program.  It  is  possible  that  an  ARPA–E
research could eventually offer big payoff in the commercial energy
market. At the same time, we are seeing some payoffs coming from
existing  DOE  research,  especially  in  hydrogen,  nuclear,  wind,  and
solar  programs.  My  concern  is  that  the  ARPA–E  could  possibly  di-
vert  funds  away  from  these  existing  programs,  and  jeopardize  the
advances that we are seeing in those areas. I hope that we can find
a way to ensure that that doesn’t happen.

Also, unlike DARPA, DOE doesn’t have the contracting power to
require private companies and utilities to use the technologies that
an ARPA–E might produce. We are still not sure how best to clear
the hurdle from basic, applied research in our National Labs, to ap-
plying  that  research  in  the  commercial  market.  It  is  reasonable  to
think  that  without  the  ability  to  mandate  applications,  the  higher
risk ARPA–E programs would be able to conquer that tech transfer
challenge. It is the question.

So, hopefully, these questions, the one about whether it would si-
phon  off  funds,  and  the  one  about  whether  the  lack  of  contracting
power will affect the success of an ARPA–E, are two questions that
we can discuss here today, as well as refinements to the bill.

In  any  event,  I  think  we  can  all  agree  that  science  and  tech-
nology  holds  some  of  the  solutions  to  the  most  pressing  problems
that  we  face,  especially  our  dependence  on  fossil  fuels  from  the
most  unstable  regions  of  the  world  make  us  a  nation  at  risk.  We
must  break  through  to  alternative  sources  of  energy,  and  I  hope
that  ARPA–E,  if  we  create  an  ARPA–E,  that  it  can  be  a  big  part
of that story of success and progress.

So,  thank  you  again  for  holding  the  hearing,  and  I  look  forward
to  discussing  these  questions,  and  hearing  what  the  panel  has  to
say about a new ARPA–E.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BOB INGLIS

Good afternoon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing on the estab-

lishment of the Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA–E).

Mr.  Chairman,  we  share  the  same  vision:  America  serving  the  world  and  suc-

ceeding as the leading technological innovator.

We share the same goal: creating incentives for technological advancement.

We  share  some  of  the  same  strategies  and  tactics  toward  the  attainment  of  the

goal and the fulfillment of the vision.

I’m  not  opposed  to  creating  a  federal  agency  within  the  Department  of  Energy  to
mimic  the  risk-embracing  and  entrepreneurial  qualities  of  the  DARPA  program.  It
is possible that the ARPA–E research could eventually offer a big payoff in the com-
mercial  energy  market.  At  the  same  time,  I  already  see  real  payoffs  coming  from
existing DOE research, especially hydrogen, nuclear, wind, and solar programs. I’m
concerned  that  the  ARPA–E  fund  will  divert  funds  away  from  these  existing  pro-
grams and jeopardize the advances we’re already seeing in these areas. I hope that
we can find a way to ensure that this doesn’t happen.

Unlike DARPA, DOE doesn’t have the ‘‘contracting power’’ to require private com-
panies  and  utilities  to  use  the  technologies  ARPA–E  might  produce.  We’re  still  not
sure  how  best  to  clear  the  hurdle  from  basic,  applied  research  in  our  national  labs
to  applying  that  research  in  the  commercial  market.  Is  it  reasonable  to  think  that,
without  the  ability  to  mandate  applications,  the  higher  risk  ARPA–E  programs
would be able to conquer that tech transfer challenge?

Hopefully,  these  questions  will  be  addressed  in  this  hearing  today  and  in  refine-

ments to the bill.

In  any  event  we  can  all  agree  that  science  and  technology  hold  some  of  the  solu-
tions  to  the  most  pressing  problems  we  face.  Our  dependence  on  fossil  fuels  from
the  most  unstable  regions  in  the  world  make  us  a  nation  at  risk.  We  must  break
through  to  alternative  sources  of  energy,  and  I  hope  that  ARPA–E  can  be  part  of
that process.

Thank  you  again  for  holding  this  hearing,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  look  forward  to

discussing these questions with you and with the panel.

Chairwoman  GIFFORDS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Inglis,  and  if  there  are
Members  who  wish  to  submit  additional  opening  statements,  their
statements will be added to the record.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Bartlett follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE ROSCOE G. BARTLETT

Energy is the biggest challenge facing America and the world in the 21st Century.
Energy,  particularly  our  reliance  upon  cheap  energy  and  specifically,  fossil  fuels,  is
a  high-stakes  problem  that  is  the  foundation  of  concerns  about  peak  oil,  climate
change,  geopolitical  stability,  national  security,  and  economic  prosperity.  These
issues  alone  and  certainly  combined  support  the  imperative  to  develop  sustainable,
renewable  sources  of  energy  as  alternatives  to  fossil  fuels.  In  response  to  this  com-
plex  situation,  the  U.S.  needs  to  invest  in  particularly  high  risk,  high  potential  re-
search.

I  am  a  co-sponsor  of  Chairman  Gordon’s  bill,  H.R.  364,  that  seeks  to  do  this  by
establishing  an  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency  for  Energy  (ARPA–E)  within
the  DOE.  This  new  program  would  be  charged  with  the  mission  of  reducing  U.S.
dependence  on  oil  through  the  rapid  development  and  commercialization  of  trans-
formational clean energy technologies.

An  array  of  new  possibilities  needs  to  be  explored  with  more  research.  Research
and  development  is  currently  tremendously  under-invested  in  this  area.  I  under-
stand that only one-tenth of one percent of the transportation industry’s $1.8 trillion
annual revenues is dedicated to R&D compared to an industry standard of five per-
cent  to  10  percent.  In  the  past  three  decades,  energy  R&D  spending  has  dropped
by  two-thirds.  H.R.  364  proposes  $300  million  in  research  funding,  but  this  would
amount to less than 0.02 percent of these industries’ annual revenues.

We are very much like the lucky couple with a big inheritance that provides them
with 85 percent of their income. They realize that the inheritance will run out long
before  their  retirement  so  they  will  have  to  earn  more  or  spend  less  or  a  combina-
tion of both. That is about where we are with energy. Fossil fuels provide 85 percent
of the energy we consume. In order to make substantial strides, we need to establish
ARPA–E  and  invest  much  more  in  conservation,  efficiency  and  alternative  renew-
able sources of energy.

As the bill states, similar to the Department of Defense’s successful Advanced Re-
search Projects Agency (DARPA), the proposed organizational structure will be bet-
ter  positioned  to  support  innovative  and  transformational  energy  research  where
risk  and  pay-offs  are  both  high.  Dr.  William  Bonvillian  testified  that  the  key  to
DARPA’s success has been its innovative culture. Key to DARPA’s success has been
identifying  and  supporting  revolutionary  technology  breakthroughs.  DARPA  has
adapted to create the means for more easily crossing the ‘‘Valley of Death’’ between
innovations in the lab and success in the marketplace.

We  need  more  investment  in  addressing  the  ‘‘DARPA-hard  problems’’  and  enor-
mous challenges in the transition that we have to make from fossil fuels to sustain-
able, renewable sources of energy. We are so far behind what needs to be done. We
are  37  years  past  peak  oil  in  the  United  States.  Global  peak  oil  is  inevitable  and
most  experts  in  a  GAO  report  that  I  requested  project  it  could  occur  anytime  be-
tween  now  and  2020.  We  do  not  have  anymore  time  to  waste.  ARPA–E  would  be
a  beginning  in  emulating  the  structure  and  success  of  DARPA  by  attracting  talent
to  solve  DARPA-hard  energy  problems.  We  need  to  have  this  in  order  to  solve  the
energy crisis of the 21st Century.

I  was  one  of  the  scientists  and  researchers  whose  imagination  was  captured  and
galvanized by President Kennedy’s challenge to land a man on the Moon by the end
of  the  decade.  I  worked  on  the  Mercury,  Gemini  and  Apollo  programs.  It  showed
me that government leadership makes a difference in working to overcome unimagi-
nable challenges.

The father of America’s nuclear navy, Admiral Hyman Rickover, said in a speech
almost  50  years  ago  that  fossil  fuels  are  finite.  Once  burned,  they’re  gone.  We  are
about 150 years—I believe halfway—through the age of oil. Rickover describes it as
a  golden  age.  The  energy  from  oil  is  incredible.  We  have  built  a  civilization  that  is
utterly dependent upon oil. However, in 5,000 years of recorded history, the oil age
will be a blip.

What  energy  source  will  come  next?  We  have  an  obligation  to  future  generations
to  preserve  prosperity.  This  will  not  happen  unless  we  lead  a  transition  from  finite
fossil  fuels  to  sustainable,  renewable  sources  of  energy.  This  situation  is  similar  to
a farmer eating seed corn; we are compromising our future harvest. We are endan-
gering our prosperity and personal obligation to our children and grandchildren and
compromising their potential for a safe and prosperous world.

This energy crisis poses a threat to our national survival similar to what prompt-
ed  the  creation  of  DARPA  in  1957.  We  should  feel  the  same  urgency  as  there  was
in  1957  and  be  willing  to  invest  in  our  future.  The  creation  of  ARPA–E  will  help
us to overcome this momentous challenge.

Chairwoman  GIFFORDS.  At  this  time,  I  would  like  to  introduce
our  witnesses.  I  would  like  to  start  with  Mr.  John  Denniston,  who
is  a  partner  at  the  venture  capital  firm  of  Kleiner,  Perkins,
Caufield & Byers, where his portfolio includes investments in clean
energy  and  greentech  businesses,  and  has  a  particularly  valuable
perspective as an experienced investor in cutting edge technologies.
Mr.  Denniston  recently  met  with  the  Governor  of  the  State  of  Ari-
zona, Janet Napolitano, so hopefully, we will have a chance to hear
a little about that as well.

Our next witness is Mr. William Bonvillian, and he is the Direc-
tor  of  the  Washington  Office  of  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of
Technology.  Previously,  he  served  as  legislative  director  and  chief
counsel  to  Senator  Lieberman,  where  he  worked  on,  among  other
things, the establishment of a DARPA-like program at the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security.

Dr.  Stephen  Forrest  is  the  Vice  President  for  Research  at  the
University of Michigan. Dr. Forrest has held a number of positions
in  academia  and  industry,  and  we  look  forward  to  his  discussion
of  the  role  of  university  and  industry  partnerships  in  energy  re-
search and development. Thank you for being here Dr. Forrest.

And  our  final  witness  is  Dr.  Richard  Van  Atta.  He  is  a  Senior
Research Analyst with the Science & Technology Policy Institute of
the  Institute  for  Defense  Analyses,  and  one  of  the  preeminent  ex-
perts on the ARPA model for technology development.

And  our  witnesses  should  know  that  spoken  testimony,  we  like
to try to limit it to about five minutes, but obviously, we are going
to give you the time that you need, and we certainly, we have ques-
tions, and I am looking forward to a really good dialogue.

So, let us get going with Mr. Denniston.

STATEMENT OF MR. JOHN DENNISTON, PARTNER, KLEINER

PERKINS CAUFIELD & BYERS

Mr.  DENNISTON.  Good  afternoon,  Chair  Giffords,  Ranking  Mem-
ber Inglis, Chairman Gordon. I am John Denniston. I am a partner
with  the  venture  capital  firm  Kleiner  Perkins  Caufield  &  Byers,
based  in  Silicon  Valley  California.  I  am  honored  to  be  here  today.
Kleiner Perkins is a founder of TechNet, a network of technology
entrepreneurs  and  CEOs,  and  a  member  of  the  National  Venture
Capital Association. My testimony today reflects my own views.

Together  with  so  many  other  Americans,  venture  capital  profes-
sionals are deeply concerned about the risks to our nation’s welfare
posed  by  our  energy  dilemmas.  We  see  three  distinct  challenges,
each  of  them  urgent:  the  dangers  resulting  from  climate  change,
our  foreign  oil  dependency,  and  the  risk  to  American  competitive-
ness if we fail to lead the global race to develop clean energy tech-
nologies.  Yet,  we  also  have  faith  these  challenges  present  new  op-
portunities  to  create  jobs  and  prosperity.  Over  the  past  seven
years,  at  Kleiner  Perkins,  we  have  focused  on  a  new  industry,
dubbed greentech, which encompasses clean power, transportation,
and  water.  Throughout  the  world  today,  greentech  progress  is  al-
ready  shaping  the  newest  industrial  revolution.  The  only  question
is, will America once again lead the way?

I  have  addressed  your  specific  questions  in  depth  in  my  written
testimony,  and  added  some  additional  thoughts  on  the  particulars
of H.R. 364. In the interests of time this afternoon, I would like to
focus my oral remarks on three issues: ARPA–E’s mission, research
funding  levels,  and  some  reasons  for  optimism  that  a  new  public-
private  partnership  can  create  solutions  to  our  energy  predica-
ments.

My first point is ARPA–E’s mission should be to fund results-ori-
ented  translational  research  for  renewable  energies,  energy  effi-
ciency, and carbon capture and sequestration technologies. I do not
believe  Congress  should  include  within  ARPA–E’s  charter  any
other  fossil  fuel  technologies  or  nuclear  power.  They  already  domi-
nate  our  energy  system,  needing  no  regulatory  push  to  achieve
market  acceptance.  Further,  the  translational  research  process  is
much  better  suited  to  identifying  breakthrough  technologies  in
emerging areas, rather than introducing incremental improvements
in mature ones.

Second,  I  will  speak  to  energy  research  funding.  Total  federal
spending  on  renewable  energy  research,  the  clean  technologies  es-
sential  for  a  healthy,  prosperous  future,  amounts  to  little  more
than $1 billion per year. Frankly, this is inadequate relative to the
scope  of  our  problems,  and  the  sheer  size  of  the  energy  and  trans-
portation  industries,  which  amount  to  over  $1.8  trillion  annually.
We  are  way  off  scale.  Big  challenges  demand  commensurate  re-
sponses.  Our  history  shows  how  well  Americans  understand  this.
When the Soviet aerospace lead threatened U.S. prestige, we de-
voted  $140  billion,  in  current  dollar  terms,  for  the  Apollo  Project.
When  DARPA  was  established  in  1958,  to  combat  Soviet  troop  su-
periority  with  superior  military  technology,  it  received  an  initial
budget  appropriation  of  $500  million.  That  was  equivalent  to  $3.5
billion  in  2007  dollar  terms,  and  that  was  more  than  16  times  the
federal  budget  share  devoted  to  renewable  energy  research  today.

A final, more recent point of comparison. Years ago, Congress de-
cided  to  prioritize  finding  cures  to  human  disease  and  quintupled
medical  science  research  through  the  NIH,  which  today  stands  at
$28 billion annually. During the same period, energy R&D declined
by  two  thirds.  I  want  to  be  clear.  This  is  not  to  suggest  that  the
NIH budget should be reduced. That would be a mistake. My point
is, current federal renewable energy research funding, and with all
due  respect,  the  proposed  funding  levels  under  H.R.  364,  are  dan-
gerously deficient. I do empathize with the difficulty of finding new
appropriations  in  the  current  budget  environment.  We  can  discuss
that, Chairman Gordon, afterwards, but we simply must find a way
to treat our energy predicaments as a top national priority.

Finally, I would like to speak to the economic opportunity for the
United  States.  I  am  very  optimistic.  Increased  federal  sponsorship
of  clean  energy  will  pay  off  not  just  in  terms  of  climate  stability
and  national  security,  but  also  in  American  prosperity.  In  Silicon
Valley,  we  often  refer  to  a  principle  known  as  Moore’s  Law,  the
idea  that  semiconductor  performance  doubles  every  24  months.
This rule is the fundamental underpinning of the information revo-
lution,  and  today,  we  are  seeing  something  remarkably  similar  in
the energy field, a rapid cost reduction curve promising exponential
growth and technological solutions we can’t even imagine today.

American scientists are ready to innovate our way out of our en-
ergy  dilemmas,  but  the  speed  at  which  they  do  so  will  depend  on
government  policy  that  is  as  bold  and  creative  as  they  are.  I  am
grateful  for  your  leadership  with  this  initiative  today,  and  I  am
happy  to  be  at  your  disposal,  to  help  build  a  cleaner,  more  secure
energy  future  that  will  allow  America  to  lead  the  next  industrial
revolution.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN DENNISTON

Introduction

Good morning, Chairman Lampson, Ranking Member Inglis, and Members of the
Subcommittee.  My  name  is  John  Denniston.  I  am  a  partner  at  the  venture  capital
firm  Kleiner  Perkins  Caufield  &  Byers,  based  in  Silicon  Valley  California.  Founded
in 1972, Kleiner Perkins is one of America’s oldest and most successful venture cap-
ital  firms.  I’m  honored  to  be  here  today  and  to  have  the  chance  to  share  my  views
on federally-sponsored energy research.

Along  with  the  rest  of  America,  venture  capital  professionals—Republicans  and
Democrats alike—are deeply concerned about the risks to our nation’s welfare posed
by our energy dilemmas. Worried as we are, however, we are also in a unique posi-
tion to recognize that each of these challenges offers new opportunities to build our
economy, creating innovation, jobs and prosperity.

Our  daily  work  at  Kleiner  Perkins  is  to  recognize  emerging  technology  and  mar-
ket trends. We’ve funded more than 500 start-up companies over the years, backing
entrepreneurs who have introduced innovative advances in such vital growth indus-
tries  as  information  technology,  medical  products  and  services,  and  telecommuni-
cations.  More  than  170  of  our  companies  have  gone  public,  including  Amazon.com,
AOL,  Compaq  Computer,  Electronic  Arts,  Genentech,  Google,  IDEC  Pharma-
ceuticals,  Intuit,  Juniper  Networks,  Millenium  Pharmaceuticals,  Netscape,  Sun
Microsystems,  Symantec,  and  VeriSign.  Today,  our  portfolio  companies  collectively
employ  more  than  275,000  workers,  generate  $90  billion  in  annual  revenue,  and
contribute more than $400 billion of market capitalization to our public equity mar-
kets.

We now see a similar promise in the energy field—the potential to create jobs and
new prosperity for generations to come. We refer to this emerging industry, encom-
passing clean power, transportation and water technologies, as ‘‘greentech.’’

Kleiner  Perkins  is  a  member  of  the  National  Venture  Capital  Association  and  a
founding  member  of  TechNet,  a  network  of  200  CEOs  of  the  Nation’s  leading  tech-
nology  companies.  I  serve  on  TechNet’s  Green  Technologies  Task  Force,  which  last
month  released  a  detailed  set  of  policy  recommendations  to  drive  the  development
and  adoption  of  technologies  we  believe  can  help  solve  some  of  the  world’s  most
pressing  energy  and  environmental  problems.  My  testimony  today  reflects  my  own
views.

You’ve asked me specifically to address energy research and development, and in
particular,  H.R.  364,  which  proposes  the  establishment  of  ARPA–E.  I  applaud  your
consideration  of  this  critical  issue.  I  do  believe  focused  federal  funding  through  a
new  agency,  in  addition  to  increased  research  funding  from  the  Department  of  En-
ergy,  should  be  an  element  of  America’s  new  energy  plan,  and  am  happy  to  offer
some  suggestions  as  to  how  that  might  happen.  In  my  view,  we  will  not  be  able  to
address our energy problems unless there is a strong public-private energy partner-
ship, one element of which must be a new commitment to federal leadership, includ-
ing bold new policies and financial resources.

Before answering your questions, I’d like to first say something about the overall
objectives of federal energy research. Specifically, I want to articulate what I believe
are the energy dilemmas we need to resolve. Clarity of purpose will help shape our
policy initiatives.
The Challenges

I  believe  there  is  an  unprecedented  degree  of  consensus  in  America  today  as  to
our three main energy challenges: the climate crisis, our dependence on oil, and the
risk  of  losing  our  global  competitive  edge  by  failing  to  champion  new  technologies
that are becoming a huge new source of economic growth, jobs and prosperity.
The Climate Crisis

In  February  of  this  year,  a  report  of  the  more  than  2,000  scientist  members  of
the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  warned  us,  once  again,  that  the
planet  is  warming,  glaciers  are  melting  and  sea  levels  are  rising.  The  panel  con-
cluded,  with  ninety  percent  certainty,  that  human  greenhouse  gas  emissions  are
fueling these dangerous trends.

The  IPCC  released  a  second  report  earlier  this  month,  in  which  it  predicted  dire
consequences for our increasingly unstable climate. Areas already without sufficient
rain  will  become  even  drier,  leading  to  less  food  production  and  more  hunger.  The
world  will  face  more  serious  floods  and  more  severe  storms.  There’s  increased  risk
of disease.

Last  week,  a  panel  of  a  dozen  of  America’s  most  respected  retired  military  gen-
erals  and  admirals  warned  global  warming  poses  a  serious  threat  to  America’s  na-
tional  security.  They  urged  the  United  States  to  commit  to  a  stronger  national  and
international  role  to  help  stabilize  climate  change  at  levels  that  will  avoid  signifi-
cant disruption to global security and stability.

Many scientists predict we have only a short period of time to make dramatic cuts
in  our  greenhouse  gas  emissions  or  risk  irrevocably  changing  the  climate.  In  fact,
the IPCC report concludes temperatures and sea levels would continue to rise even
if  we  were  somehow  able  to  immediately  stabilize  atmospheric  concentrations.  To
date, we have failed to heed such warnings.
Energy Security

As for our energy security dilemma, this subcommittee is well aware the U.S. im-
ports  about  30  percent  of  its  overall  energy  needs,  including  approximately  60  per-
cent  of  its  oil.  Rapid  growth  in  worldwide  energy  demand  has  stretched  supplies,
tripling  the  price  of  both  crude  oil  and  natural  gas.  And  there  is  a  significant  risk
this trend will continue, as world population and energy demand increase.
Global Competitiveness

Finally,  our  future  prosperity  is  at  risk,  and  here  I  speak  from  personal  experi-
ence.  In  the  past  year,  as  I’ve  traveled  on  business  to  China  and  Europe,  I’ve  wit-
nessed  how  the  rest  of  the  world  is  striving,  and  often  succeeding,  to  emulate  the
technology  innovation  that  has  been  a  hallmark  of  the  U.S.  economy  and  perhaps
the single most important driver of our enviable standard of living. Increasingly, en-
trepreneurs  overseas  enjoy  advantages  in  the  form  of  determined  government  poli-
cies,  including  financial  incentives  and  large  investments  in  research  and  develop-
ment.

Credible  economic  studies  suggest  our  technology  industries  are  responsible  for
roughly  one-half  of  American  GDP  growth.  Our  country  would  look  quite  a  bit  dif-
ferent  today  had  we  not,  several  decades  ago,  become  a  global  leader  in  bio-

technology,  computing,  the  Internet,  medical  devices,  semiconductors,  software  and
telecommunications.

Today,  as  our  global  energy  challenges  become  ever  more  pressing,  it’s  clear  fu-
ture  economic  growth  throughout  the  world  will  depend  to  a  great  degree  on  new
technologies  to  help  us  preserve  our  environment.  Green  energy  technologies  could
very  well  become  the  economic  engine  of  the  21st  Century.  Given  its  potentially
massive  market  size,  ‘‘greentech’’  could  be  the  most  powerful  economic  force  of  our
lives. But will America again lead the way?
Subcommittee Questions

I’ll proceed now to your specific questions:

1. If ARPA–E is established, what technology areas should be explored?

I believe there are two dimensions to this question: what stage of energy research
should ARPA–E target, and what types of energy research projects should this new
agency fund?

First,  I  believe  there’s  a  critical  need  for  the  Federal  Government  to  pursue
translational  research  in  the  energy  field.  Translational  research  differs  from  basic
and applied research in that it begins with the project management team members
identifying  the  most  pressing  market  needs.  Next,  they  select  and  fund  the  most
promising  scientific  approaches  that  might  enable  breakthrough  products,  and  fi-
nally  work  to  push  the  best  candidates  through  to  the  brink  of  production.  This
process is also known as ‘‘right to left’’ research since the ends determine the means.
Translational research is by no means a substitute for basic or applied research—
both  of  these  are  also  critically  important.  But  when  it  comes  to  energy  issues,
translational  research  has  received  only  scant  federal  support—thus,  this  is  where
a new research agency could make the biggest difference. Translational research on
defense  issues  at  DARPA,  after  all,  has  resulted  in  the  commercialization  of  many
important  technologies,  including  the  precursor  to  the  Internet,  robotics,  high-en-
ergy lasers, computer hardware, software and semiconductor fabrication.

To  whatever  degree  possible,  the  legislation  creating  the  new  energy  research
agency  should  support  a  distinct  culture  and  structure—with  both,  ideally,  mir-
roring  DARPA’s  successful  traits.  Like  DARPA,  the  new  agency  should  be  small,
nimble,  unafraid  of  risk,  and  ‘‘flat’’—i.e.,  non-hierarchical.  It  should  also  have  cabi-
net-level sponsorship and support. This separate structure and identity would allow
the  new  agency  to  create  and  sustain  a  culture  suitable  for  translational  research.
With respect to the energy source question, I recommend ARPA–E fund renewable
energies and energy efficiency technologies, including advanced batteries, fuel cells,
solar, wind, geothermal, and biofuels.

Given the urgency of reducing carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, I be-
lieve ARPA–E should additionally have funding oversight for carbon capture and se-
questration research. Other than this, however, I do not believe Congress should in-
clude fossil fuel technologies or nuclear power in ARPA–E’s charter.

ARPA–E’s  mission  should  be  to  fund  projects  that  can  solve  our  urgent  energy
challenges: climate change, energy security and American competitiveness. And our
best  hope  of  doing  so  is  to  rapidly  develop  clean,  alternative  energy  sources.  Our
experience with DARPA should encourage us to expect ARPA–E to identify and de-
velop  innovative  and  commercially  viable  energy  technologies  we  have  not  yet  even
considered.

Fossil  and  nuclear  energy  sources  already  dominate  our  energy  system,  needing
no  regulatory  push  to  achieve  market  adoption.  Nor  is  the  translational  research
process  I’ve  described  above,  and  which  I  so  strongly  recommend  for  ARPA–E,  de-
signed to make incremental improvements to mature technologies such as these. On
the other hand, translational research would be an excellent fit for emerging renew-
able energy, energy efficiency and carbon capture and sequestration technologies.

Finally,  there  is  a  question  as  to  whether  ARPA–E  should  also  fund  demonstra-
tion  projects.  There  is  no  doubt  the  Federal  Government  should  significantly  in-
crease its support for demonstration projects. In theory, ARPA–E could be the vehi-
cle to do so. However, some have questioned whether this would confuse ARPA–E’s
mission and be contrary to the goal of creating a small, nimble organization. DARPA
benefited enormously over the years from its focused mission and consistent culture.
The  Subcommittee  should  be  mindful  of  this  history  as  it  thinks  through  the  opti-
mal  approach  to  demonstration  projects.  One  potential  strategy  would  be  to  create
a separate division within DOE to manage demonstration projects.
2. What  value  can  federal  resources  bring  to  technology  investors  and  the

private sector in developing innovative energy technologies?

17

Federal resources can accelerate the adoption of innovative energy technologies in
three ways: provide a level of research funding commensurate with the scope of our
challenges;  impose  a  price  on  carbon  emissions  that  reflects  their  actual  costs;  and
help create market conditions that are receptive to new energy solutions.
Accelerate  Renewable  Energy  and  Energy  Efficiency  Technologies  by  Substantially
Increasing Federal Research Funds

The Federal Government should significantly increase funding for energy research
and development. My understanding, based on a recent review by the American As-
sociation for the Advancement of Science, is the Federal Government currently pro-
vides  roughly  $1  billion  annually  for  all  non-nuclear,  clean  and  renewable  energy
research.  This  is  for  our  fast-changing  energy  and  transportation  industries,  which
account  for  more  than  $1.8  trillion  of  our  current  gross  domestic  product  annually.
Senior personnel at many of the top U.S. academic institutions have emphasized to
me  how  little  federal  energy  research  funds  are  available  for  non-nuclear  tech-
nologies—the cleanest, safest way out of our energy predicament.

In  the  health  care  sector,  in  contrast,  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  annually
provide  $28  billion  in  research  funding.  In  the  past  three  decades,  while  energy
R&D  spending  has  dropped  by  two-thirds,  health  care  R&D  has  more  than  quin-
tupled.  The  research-dollar  discrepancy  between  the  energy  and  health  care  fields
is particularly striking when you consider that each accounts for roughly 15 percent
of U.S. GDP. I want to be clear—I am not suggesting for a moment the NIH budget
should  be  reduced.  That  would  be  a  mistake.  My  point  is  we  must  find  a  way  to
increase  federal  sponsorship  of  clean  energy  research,  several-fold,  to  build  up  this
young  industry  sufficiently  to  give  ourselves  a  fair  chance  of  solving  our  three  seri-
ous  energy  problems  of  climate  change,  energy  security  and  global  competitiveness.
Solving  these  problems  will  take  all  the  leadership  and  financial  commitment  we
can muster. Consider: America, in current purchasing power, spent over $20 billion
on the Manhattan Project and over $135 billion on the Apollo Project. Further, when
DARPA  was  created  in  1958,  it  received  a  budget  appropriation  of  $500  million,
which is the equivalent of $3.5 billion in current dollar terms. This amounted to .67
percent  of  total  federal  spending  that  year.  Today,  our  spending  on  all  renewable
energy  represents  less  than  .04  percent  of  current  federal  outlays.  In  other  words,
DARPA’s initial appropriation was more than 16 times the federal budget share de-
voted to renewable energy research today.

Beyond  increasing  overall  energy  research  funding,  Congress  should  ensure  the
vast  majority  of  new  funding  targets  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency.  Over
the  past  50  years,  nuclear  energy  has  received  over  95  percent  of  U.S.  funds  spent
on non-fossil fuel energy sources. We need to level the playing field.

Boosting  our  commitment  to  renewables  today  is  the  best  investment  we  can
make  to  guarantee  our  future  economic  competitiveness.  I’m  convinced  the  next
global industrial revolution will depend on the substitution of renewable energy for
incumbent sources. Countries that develop strong domestic greentech industries will
surely advance their economies and provide the jobs of the future.

Will we be one of these leaders? After all, our standard of living today is the high-
est in the world, largely due to our leadership in technology innovation over the past
half-century.  But  if  we  don’t  act  decisively  while  we  still  have  the  time,  we  could
easily  be  left  behind  in  this  new  wave  of  innovation,  eventually  becoming  a  buyer,
not a seller, of the pioneering energy technologies the world will demand.
Impose A Price On Carbon Emissions

Economists have been urging us for years to put a price on carbon that would ac-
curately  reflect  its  costs  to  society.  Making  fossil  fuels  more  expensive  will  make
newer,  cleaner  power  sources  relatively  less  costly,  thus  increasing  demand  for
them.  There  are  two  ways  to  accomplish  this:  a  carbon  tax,  and  a  carbon  cap-and-
trade system.

A  carbon  tax  has  the  advantage  of  simplicity  and  speed  of  implementation,  but
there are two key shortcomings: taxes of any sort are politically unpopular, and we
will not know for certain the reduction in carbon emissions that will result from any
given level of taxation. As to the political issue, however, I would argue public senti-
ment  has  changed  so  dramatically  in  just  the  past  couple  of  years,  which  brought
us  Katrina,  ‘‘An  Inconvenient  Truth,’’  and  the  last  two  IPCC  reports,  that  policies
once considered unacceptable may now be possible. Al Gore, when he was here, ad-
vocated an innovative ‘‘tax shift’’ that would achieve tax revenue neutrality by elimi-
nating  the  payroll  tax  simultaneously  with  the  adoption  of  a  carbon  tax.  I  rec-
ommend Congress explore Mr. Gore’s idea.

A  well-designed  cap-and-trade  system  would  address  the  second  problem  with  a
carbon tax: it would offer certainty in emissions reduction. An additional advantage

is  that  while  it  penalizes  companies  that  continue  to  pollute,  it  also  rewards  those
that  make  progress  in  adopting  clean  energy.  America  had  success  with  a  cap-and-
trade  system  in  the  1990s,  when  it  was  used  to  curb  sulfur-dioxide  emissions  caus-
ing acid rain.

In my view, Congress should consider a combined carbon tax/cap-and-trade pack-
age  that  would  offer  the  implementation  speed  of  a  carbon  tax,  along  with  the  pre-
dictable  environmental  outcome  of  a  cap-and-trade  system.  This  combination  strat-
egy would not result in a ‘‘double tax.’’ Instead, it would ensure we establish a car-
bon  price  level  that  achieves  the  reduction  target  as  quickly  as  possible.  If  the  car-
bon tax reduces carbon emissions to at least the level required by the cap-and-trade
system, there simply won’t be as many trades.
Create Market Conditions Supporting Renewable and Energy Efficiency Solutions

There  are  several  measures  Congress  should  enact  to  accelerate  the  adoption  of

renewable energy sources, including:

• Renewable  Portfolio  Standard  and  Expanded  Renewable  Fuel  Standard.  A
new  federal  RPS,  and  a  substantially  higher  RFS  threshold,  would  send  a
powerful  signal  to  the  private  market.  Entrepreneurs  and  investors  could  be
confident  a  market  will  exist  for  innovative  new  products,  even  if  they  have
not yet had a chance to achieve economies of scale.

• Federal Incentives to Drive Clean Energy Development. Potential mechanisms
include  tax  credits,  subsidies,  and  loan  guarantees.  In  addition,  Congress
should consider creating incentives for U.S. greentech companies to manufac-
ture their products in this country. European and Asian countries offer incen-
tives  for  U.S.-based  companies  to  establish  manufacturing  operations  over-
seas,  in  some  cases  including  government  payment  of  40  percent  of  upfront
capital costs and 15-year tax holidays.

• Energy  Efficiency  Standards.  The  United  States  could  make  great  headway
in  solving  our  energy  challenges  by  simply  combating  wastefulness.  To  this
end,  Congress  should  strengthen  CAFE´ standards,  require  energy  efficiency
standards  for  electronic  equipment  and  appliances,  and  work  with  states  to
create  similar  standards  for  buildings.  Congress  should  also  evaluate  how  to
work  with  utilities  so  their  profit  potential  is  driven  as  much  by  introducing
energy efficiency as it is by selling power.

• Federal  Procurement.  The  Federal  Government  is  the  single  largest  U.S.  en-
ergy  consumer.  As  such,  it  can  lead  our  energy  transition  by  becoming  the
single largest green-technology user.

• Biofuels.  Congress  could  take  several  steps  to  strengthen  the  rapidly  emerg-
ing  biofuels  market.  One  of  these  should  be  an  increase  in  the  Renewable
Fuels  Standard  consistent  with  President  Bush’s  call  to  reduce  gasoline  con-
sumption  by  20  percent  over  the  next  ten  years.  Another  contribution  would
be  to  restructure  the  existing  blender’s  credit  so  it  is  paid  to  ethanol  pro-
ducers  rather  than  gasoline  distributors,  provides  a  credit  level  that  is  in-
versely  related  to  the  price  of  gasoline  (creating  a  safety  net  for  ethanol  pro-
ducers in the case of a sudden drop in gasoline prices), and is made available
to  all  alternative  fuels,  not  just  ethanol  and  specific  molecular  formulations
of butanol.

3. Can  you  comment  on  the  relationship  between  the  federal,  university
and private industry sectors in energy research and technology develop-
ment?  Would  an  ARPA–E  enhance  this  relationship  to  get  more  tech-
nologies into the marketplace?
Historically, the Federal Government, American research universities and private
industry have collaborated to unleash innovation in the information technology and
life  science  sectors.  The  Federal  Government’s  indispensable  role  has  been  to  fund
basic and applied research, and in some cases, translational research.

I  will  share  two  examples.  In  the  1960’s  and  1970’s,  NIH  funding  for  basic  re-
search  in  genetics  at  many  U.S.  universities  helped  launch  what  is  today’s  flour-
ishing biotechnology industry. Similarly, in the 1970’s and 1980’s, DARPA provided
funding  to  U.S.  universities  to  first  research,  and  later  create,  a  communications
network  to  tie  together  the  Department  of  Defense  and  the  various  groups  around
the country performing defense research. That network, known as DARPANET, was
the  precursor  to  the  Internet.  The  Federal  Government’s  funding  role  has  had  a
mighty  impact:  without  it,  U.S.  biotechnology  and  Internet  industries  would  surely
not be as advanced as they are today.

Today, however, with only a few exceptions, such as nuclear technology, the DOE
provides  very  little  energy  research  funding  to  American  universities.  As  a  result,
there  is  very  little  government-university-industry  collaboration  in  the  alternative
energy  world.  In  fact,  today’s  state  of  affairs  may  be  discouraging  American  sci-
entific  talent  from  entering  this  important  sector.  Many  senior  university  research-
ers have told me scientific talent would immediately flow into the renewable energy
field if only federal research dollars were available to support projects.

Congress  now  has  a  chance  to  revive  the  productive  partnership  of  the  past.  It
can  create  a  new  agency  to  pursue  translational  research  focused  on  renewable  en-
ergy,  energy  efficiency,  and  carbon  capture  and  sequestration  projects.  It  can  also
demonstrate  its  commitment  to  solving  our  urgent  energy  predicaments  by  signifi-
cantly boosting overall renewable energy funding—both within DOE and in this new
agency—to a level commensurate with the scope of the challenge.
4. Is there a concern in the business and financial communities about com-
mercializing technologies developed by the Department of Energy? If so,
what  steps  should  be  taken  to  ensure  that  the  technologies  developed
within ARPA–E will make a comfortable transition to commercial appli-
cation?
The only concern of which I am aware is there have historically been few opportu-
nities  to  commercialize  breakthrough  energy  technologies  sponsored  by  the  Depart-
ment  of  Energy  outside  of  the  nuclear  field.  I  can  assure  you  private  industry  will
be eager to do its part if the volume of DOE-sponsored renewable projects increases.
As  for  the  second  part  of  this  question,  I’ll  repeat  what  I’ve  said  above.  ARPA–
E  can  play  a  vital  role  in  ensuring  technologies  cross  the  divide  from  laboratory  to
market  by  introducing  a  translational  research  approach  to  federal  research  fund-
ing, focused on renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon capture and seques-
tration.
Additional Comments on H.R. 364

I’d like now to offer my thoughts on a few specific provisions of H.R. 364.

Goal

The  expressed  goal  of  H.R.  364  is  to  ‘‘reduce  the  amount  of  energy  the  United
States  imports  from  foreign  sources  by  20  percent  over  the  next  10  years.’’  There
is  a  great  advantage  to  having  this  kind  of  clarity,  but  I  urge  you  to  expand  your
objectives.  While  our  reliance  on  foreign  oil  is  a  serious  issue,  it’s  just  one  part  of
our  energy  predicament.  I  do  believe  we  must  also  keep  in  mind  the  serious  prob-
lems  looming  for  our  nation  if  we  don’t  act  boldly  to  solve  climate  change  and  re-
establish  our  technological  leadership  by  leading  the  new  green  industrial  revolu-
tion.

Furthermore,  I  see  that  part  of  the  goal  of  the  bill  is  to  accelerate  innovation  in
‘‘both  traditional  and  alternative  energy  sources. . .’’  As  I  have  explained  above,  I
strongly  suggest  ARPA–E’s  mandate  focus  on  renewable  energies,  efficiency  strate-
gies and carbon capture and sequestration techniques.
Structure

H.R.  364  proposes  placing  ARPA–E  within  the  Department  of  Energy.  Others
have  suggested  the  agency  might  have  more  success  if  established  as  a  quasi-inde-
pendent agency outside of DOE. I’m not an expert in this area, but would urge Con-
gress  to  adopt  the  organizational  structure  that  would  give  the  new  agency  max-
imum  autonomy  so  it  can  foster  a  nimble,  fast-moving,  risk-taking  culture,  and  at
the  same  time,  provide  it  with  cabinet-level  protection  and  support  to  keep  it  ade-
quately funded and effective.
Funding

H.R. 364’s proposal to create a fund which will receive $300 million in appropria-
tions  in  2007  and  scale  up  to  $915  million  in  2012  is  far  short  of  what  is  required
to solve our energy problems. I refer you to my answer to Question 2, above. While
I  do  appreciate  the  difficulty  of  finding  resources  for  new  projects,  we  need  to  bear
in  mind  the  massive  scale  of  the  American  energy  and  transportation  industries,
which  account  for  more  than  $1.8  trillion  in  combined  annual  revenue,  amounting
to  roughly  15  percent  of  U.S.  GDP.  The  proposed  $300  million  in  research  funding
would  amount  to  less  than  0.02  percent  of  these  industries’  annual  revenues.  We
need to do much more, and move much faster, if we’re to have any chance of solving
our problems while we still can. We can and must do better than that.

Recoupment

Frankly,  I  believe  the  recoupment  provision  in  H.R.  364  is  inappropriate  for
translational research funding projects. It appears, moreover, to be a departure from
past  practices,  with  many  unanswered  questions  about  how  it  would  work.  Would
an  ARPA–E  aim  to  recoup  its  investment  from  our  research  universities?  From  in-
dustry  partners?  The  provision  will  likely  deter  some  potential  industry  collabo-
rators  and  almost  certainly  slow  down  the  commercialization  process.  Let’s  not  at-
tach  a  string  to  these  funds.  If  ARPA–E  succeeds  in  commercializing  breakthrough
technologies,  the  Federal  Government  will  be  compensated  many  times  over  in  the
form of income and payroll tax revenues.
Review

H.R.  364  calls  for  the  President’s  Council  of  Advisors  on  Science  and  Technology
to  evaluate  ARPA–E  just  two  and  a  half  years  after  it  is  established,  to  determine
whether  it  should  be  discontinued.  To  me,  this  seems  counterproductive.  If  ARPA–
E isn’t working as well as it should, let’s fix it. Let’s not structure this new agency
so that all translational research for renewable energy, energy efficiency and carbon
capture  and  sequestration  might  cease  because  the  agency  fails  to  produce  results
in short order. Setting an unrealistic timeline would surely also make it difficult to
hire top-flight talent.
Reason For Hope: The Opportunities

I  would  like  to  conclude  my  remarks  by  saying  how  confident  I  am  we  can  solve

our energy challenges through a new public-private partnership.

Kleiner Perkins has been investing in greentech for the past seven years, backing
more than 15 innovative companies in the fields of biofuels, coal gasification, energy
efficiency,  energy  storage,  fuel  cells,  solar  energy,  thermoelectrics  and  transpor-
tation. In the process, we’ve witnessed how technological progress is already revolu-
tionizing  our  relationship  with  energy,  solving  problems  that  only  recently  seemed
all  but  intractable.  Solar  manufacturers  are  innovating  their  way  around  silicon
shortages,  with  next-generation  materials  including  pioneering  thin-film  tech-
nologies. The agriculture industry is producing transportation fuels from plant mat-
ter—even  from  microscopic  algae—and  is  developing  exciting  new  way  to  convert
weeds  to  biofuels.  Nanotechnology  breakthroughs  are  creating  the  promise  of  new
ways  to  store  energy,  which  in  turn  could  dramatically  speed  up  market  adoption
of solar and wind power.

At  Kleiner  Perkins,  four  accelerating  trends  have  encouraged  us  to  make

greentech a core investment sector:

ternative energy sources more attractive;

• We’re  already  seeing  exponential  growth  in  the  energy  technology  field,  with
a  rapid  cost-reduction  curve  sure  to  become  ever  steeper  over  time,  making
emerging sources of energy increasingly competitive;
• Rising  prices  for  fossil  fuels—oil  and  natural  gas—are  making  competing  al-
• World-class talent, with both missionary and monetary motives, is racing into
• Americans are growing much more aware of and concerned by our energy cri-
ses, a development we believe will lend support to more sweeping policy solu-
tions.

the greentech sector;

Moore’s Law & The Pace of Technological Progress

In  Silicon  Valley,  we  often  refer  to  a  principle  known  as  Moore’s  Law,  which  I’d
like  to  explain  briefly  here,  as  it’s  fortunately  quite  relevant  to  what  we  see  hap-
pening  in  the  energy  field.  Intel  co-founder  Gordon  Moore  has  been  credited  with
predicting,  back  in  the  1960s,  that  semiconductor  performance  would  double  every
24  months.  That  prediction  was  spot  on,  and  helps  explain  the  information  tech-
nology revolution of the past three decades. Better, faster, and cheaper silicon chips
led  our  transition  from  an  era—remember,  it  was  just  25  years  ago!—of  big,  main-
frame  computers  used  principally  by  university  researchers,  to  our  capacity  today
to read the morning’s headlines on our cell phones.

Today, we can already see a Moore’s Law dynamic operating in the energy sector,
giving us confidence the rate of greentech performance improvement and cost reduc-
tion  will  offer  new  energy  solutions  we  can’t  even  imagine  right  now.  At  Kleiner
Perkins,  we  are  excited  by  the  technical  breakthroughs  we  have  seen  in  a  host  of
scientific disciplines relating to the energy sectors, including material science, phys-
ics, electrical engineering, synthetic chemistry, and even biotechnology. We are par-
ticularly  encouraged  by  innovations  resulting  from  a  combination  of  breakthroughs
in several of these separate disciplines into single products.

Witness some of these examples of the greentech equivalent of Moore’s Law:

21

• The price of wind power has plummeted by an order of magnitude since 1980,
to the point where, in some regions, it is now very close to being able to com-
pete with coal and gas power;

• Solar  power  costs  have  fallen  by  more  than  60  percent  over  the  past  fifteen

• Ethanol  production  efficiencies  per  gallon  have  improved  by  more  than  45

years;

percent since 1982.

These and other improvements have occurred over a period of time in which there

was relatively little government policy or entrepreneurial focus on these sectors.

Today, the high cost of many new energy sources, relative to the incumbent com-
petition, represents the most serious barrier to greater capital investment and more
rapid adoption of clean power. Why does green power cost more? Primarily because
it’s so new. Being new, it is still at the very early stages of its cost-reduction curve,
and is being produced in such low volumes that the industry has yet to benefit from
economies of scale.

We  can  be  certain  American  scientists  and  engineers  will  continually  innovate  to
improve  the  performance  and  reduce  the  costs  of  these  technologies  going  forward.
But the speed at which they do so will depend to a large degree on government pol-
icy  that  is  as  bold  and  innovative  as  they  are.  With  strong  Federal  Government
leadership,  imagine  what  American  ingenuity  will  be  able  to  accomplish  in  the  fu-
ture  as  more  and  more  of  our  best  and  brightest  devote  their  life’s  work  to  the
greentech field.

Once  again,  I  want  to  thank  the  Subcommittee  for  inviting  me  here  today.  I  be-
lieve  we  all  have  an  opportunity  to  be  part  of  the  solution  to  our  country’s  energy
crises. I look forward to today’s hearing and to learning about how we can work to-
gether to build a more secure future.

going to hear from Mr. Bonvillian.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  WILLIAM  B.  BONVILLIAN,  DIRECTOR,
WASHINGTON  OFFICE,  MASSACHUSETTS  INSTITUTE  OF
TECHNOLOGY
Mr.  BONVILLIAN.  Thank  you,  Madam  Chairman,  Ranking  Mem-
ber  Inglis,  Chairman  Gordon,  Members  of  the  Subcommittee.  I  ap-
preciate  the  opportunity  to  talk  with  you  today.  I  want  to  note  at
the outset that the views I am going to express are not necessarily
those of my employer, MIT.

Let  me  first  discuss  the  energy  technology  challenge.  John  has
summarized that this is a high stakes challenge. Some have called
for  a  Manhattan  Project,  some  have  called  for  an  Apollo  Project.
Those famous technology development projects were focused on sin-
gle  technologies  to  be  stood  up  in  a  comparatively  short  period  of
time,  with  a  single  customer  with  very  deep  pockets,  the  govern-
ment.  They  were  not  designed  for  deeply  embedded,  stratified,
highly competitive private sector markets. We are going to need an
array of new technologies launched over a period of time, and there
is going to be no short-term single energy silver bullet.

You know, getting to the Moon in some ways starts to look fairly
simple,  given  the  complexities  of  the  task  that  we  have  in  front  of
us. Do we have the right institutional models that are going to put
us  in  a  place  to  handle  this  kind  of  challenge?  And  I  would  argue
that  the  translational  model  is  potentially  an  applicable  model  for
this  energy  innovation  challenge.  Over  the  last  half  century,  the
big  problem  that  we  have  had  in  launching  new  technologies  has
been  to  bridge  the  valley  of  death  between  the  research  side  and
the innovation side.

The most successful model, as the Subcommittee well knows, has
been DARPA, established by President Eisenhower in ’57. It is sort
of a model that works right to left, it looks at the right side of the
innovation  pipeline,  the  kind  of  results  that  may  be  needed,  and
then  reaches  back  to  the  left  side  to  figure  out  the  fundamental
science  breakthroughs  that  are  going  to  get  us  to  the  responses
that  we  need  to  have  on  the  right  side.  To  borrow  a  phrase  from
MIT’s  President  Susan  Hockfield,  it  is  very  important  that  science
sow  lots  of  fields  of  wildflowers,  but  in  addition  to  that,  it  is  very
important  to  bring  those  wildflowers  into  a  garden  occasionally,
and gardening has been DARPA’s business.

Erich  Bloch,  who  was  President  Reagan’s  very  noted  head  of
NSF, pointed out, research that collects dust on a shelf is not worth
much  to  society.  DARPA  has  attempted,  not  always  successfully,
but attempted to move things off the shelf. Let me emphasize, too,
that an ARPA–E is not going to be able to impose technology solu-
tions  on  the  private  sector.  Its  role  is  going  to  be  to  expand  those
options,  to  reduce  the  technology  standup  barriers  and  risks,  to
make them within range of private sector acceptance. This is going
to have to be a collaborative effort.

Let  me  dig  a  little  deeper  into  the  DARPA  culture,  because  I
think there are some lessons here, if we are going to have an insti-
tution  that  is  workable.  First,  DARPA  has  used  something  called
a hybrid model. It creates collaborative teams with the best univer-
sity  researchers,  and  connects  them  with  outstanding  firms,  often
small or mid-sized startup firms.

These  teams  have  created  the  connectedness  that  has  enabled
better movement across the valley of death that I talked about be-
fore.  Now,  you  can’t  legislate  culture.  But  you  probably  can  put
some  management  guidance  into  this  legislation,  and  there  are
parts  of  the  DARPA  ruleset  that  I  think  will  be  critical  to  making
the  culture  of  this  translational  model  work.  I  will  just  cite  a  few.
Keep  it  small,  keep  it  flexible.  Make  it  flat,  non-hierarchical.
Allow  the  entity  autonomy  and  freedom  from  bureaucratic  impedi-
ments.  Get  a  world-class  technical  staff.  Create  outstanding  teams
and  networks  among  the  researcher  teams.  Ensure  in  hiring  both
staff continuity and change. Put the leadership in the hands of out-
standing  program  managers.  Emphasize  acceptance  of  failure  and
willingness to take risks. Set an orientation to revolutionary break-
throughs.  And  create  a  mix  of  connected  collaborators  that  rep-
resent a series of disciplines that come to bear on problems.

Now, in my written testimony, I have a description of some other
organizational  models,  which  the  Committee  asked  me  to  talk
about.  Those  are  complex  and  complicated,  and  I  have  only  a  lim-
ited amount of time. Hopefully, we can come back to those, particu-

larly  the  sort  of  government  corporation  model  and  the  experience
at HSARPA, because I think there are lessons here, but let me em-
phasize, I think, some of what John was talking about.

We  need  to  operate  at  scale  here  if  we  are  going  to  stand  this
up. The energy sector is a trillion dollar sector. A modestly funded
R&D  effort  is  just  not  going  to  drive  transformational  shifts,  and
we are not to get there on the cheap. So, the funding at the outset
is  the  critical  issue.  Recoupment  only  solves  a  later  end  problem.
I  agree  we  can  talk  about  some  of  the  alternative  revenue  sources
that might be possibilities.

Let  me  try  and  summarize  a  few  key  points  here.  Energy  tech-
nology  is  a  major,  complex  challenge,  probably  the  most  difficult
technology challenge we have ever faced. There is a gap in our fed-
eral  innovation  institutions  for  energy,  and  we  will  call  that  a
translational research gap. A way of filling that gap is to follow the
DARPA-like  model  with  an  ARPA–E,  build 
it  around  a
translational model that combines, in a hybrid approach, great uni-
versity,  and  great  firm  researchers,  and  make  them  compete.  The
culture of DARPA is going to determine its success, not the legisla-
tive framework, so getting that culture right is crucial.

DARPA  could  be  stood  up  inside  DOE,  it  could  be  stood  up  out-
side  it.  In  either  case,  it  is  probably  going  to  have  to  follow  what
is known as an ‘‘island bridge’’ model. You want to allow this entity
a  substantial  amount  of  autonomy  to  be  creative,  but  it  has  to  be
connected  back  by  a  bridge  to  leaders  that  are  going  to  encourage
it  and  protect  it.  And  you  must  ensure  that  it  has  support  and
funding. So, you need the island and the bridge.

Energy R&D is underfunded, and ARPA–E is going to need to op-
erate  at  significant  scale  to  achieve  success.  We  should  not  do
ARPA–E  unless  we  are  prepared  to  meet  that  challenge.  An
ARPA–E  is  not  going  to  focus  on  short-term  problems.  We  have  a
long-term focus that we need to tackle here.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN

Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Inglis, Members of the Subcommittee:

I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today. I should note the outset that
the views I express today are my own, and I am not speaking for my employer, MIT.
I  ask  that  my  Comments  to  the  Committee  submitted  on  April  2nd  elaborating  on
this issue be included in the hearing record.
THE ENERGY TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGE:

Energy is a high-stakes problem with much hanging in the balance—energy secu-
rity  and  resource  dependency  on  the  Middle  East,  climate  change,  economy-wide
shake-downs from high cartel-imposed prices, disruptive trade imbalances, and mac-
roeconomic  trade  costs.1 In  response,  some  have  called  for  a  Manhattan  Project  for
new energy technology, or for the equivalent of the Apollo Moon Mission. But those
famous  technology  development  projects  were  focused  on  single  technologies  to  be
stood  up  in  comparatively  short-term  multi-year  projects.  They  were  simple  com-
pared  to  the  energy  technology  challenge.  The  technologies  launched  then  were  for
a single customer with the deepest pockets, for the government sector, not for deeply
imbedded,  stratified  and  highly  competitive  private  sector  markets.  Energy  chal-

lenges require a very different development model in which a complex mix of energy
technologies  must  evolve  over  decades  into  the  private  sector.  As  some  have  noted,
there will be no short-term energy silver bullet.

An  array  of  new  energy  technology  is  needed.  Some  of  these  technologies  have
been tested at economic scale and are ready for demonstration and implementation,
others  require  breakthrough  research,  still  others  both  breakthroughs  and  large-
scale  development.  These  technologies  show  that  a  new  energy  economy  is  possible
if  we  have  the  political  will  to  make  it  happen.  A  key  point  is  that  we  will  need
many  strands  of  technology  development  in  multiple  time  dimensions;  there  cannot
be a single technology focus. And the technology development system we create will
need  to  consider  and  retain  room  for  evolving  advances  over  time—there  will  be
next  generation  batteries  and  solar  but  there  will  be  third  and  fourth  generation
advances that will displace the first and second generations, so there must be space
for promoting both incremental advance and disruptive new technologies; technology
arterial  sclerosis  must  be  avoided.  We  have  a  complex  systems  problem—there  will
be multiple energy technology pathways that must evolve over time, and each path
will be different, although many will have to be complementary. This is perhaps the
most  complex  technology  evolution  problem  the  U.S.  has  ever  faced.  It  makes  get-
ting to the Moon start to look simple by comparison.
THE  TRANSLATIONAL  MODEL  FOR  ENERGY  TECHNOLOGY  INNOVA-

TION:

Over  the  past  half  century,  the  most  difficult  step  in  a  technological  revolution
has been to bridge the ‘‘valley of death’’ between research and innovation. The gov-
ernment  has  played  a  major  role  in  this  bridge-building,  on  the  innovation  ‘‘front
end’’  by  support  for  R&D,  and  on  the  ‘‘back  end’’  by  supporting  technology  proto-
typing  and  initial  market  creation,  largely  though  its  pervasive  role  in  the  defense
technology sector.

The  most  successful  model,  as  the  Subcommittee  is  aware,  for  bridging  the  gap
between  research  and  innovation,  for  moving  from  the  front  end  close  to  back  end,
in  the  U.S.  innovation  system  has  been  the  Defense  Advanced  Research  Projects
Agency  (DARPA),  established  by  President  Eisenhower  in  1957.  While  DARPA  has
played many roles over many years, its most important role is sometimes described
as  working  ‘‘right-left.’’  DARPA  represented  a  change  from  the  ‘‘basic  science  only’’
model  of  most  U.S.  R&D  agencies  and  aimed  for  a  ‘‘connected’’  model  that  bridges
the ‘‘Valley of Death,’’ reaching between research and late stage technology develop-
ment up to the prototyping stage. In other words, DARPA has connected the stages
in the U.S. R&D pipeline that traditionally have been institutionally separated and
has  put  R&D  and  technology  on  a  continuum.  It  has  done  this  by  following  the
‘‘right-left’’  model—deciding  up  front  on  a  breakthrough  technology  that  must  be
achieved on the right side of the innovation pipeline, then reaching back to the left
side  of  the  pipeline  to  seek  the  most  promising  breakthroughs  in  science  that  must
be  found  and  nurtured  to  get  there.  This  is  the  opposite  of  the  curiosity-driven-re-
search-without-regard-to-technology-objective that dominated the ethos of most U.S.
fundamental  science  agencies.  To  borrow  a  phrase  from  MIT’s  President  Susan
Hockfield, for science success it is important to sow fields of wildflowers; sometimes
it is also important to bring those wildflowers into a garden.

A  good  term  for  DARPA’s  role  is  ‘‘translational’’—translating  science  break-
throughs into technology that gets stood up and implemented. As Erich Bloch, Presi-
dent Reagan’s famed NSF Director, once pointed out, research that collects dust on
a shelf is not worth much to our society. DARPA’s role has been in nurturing tech-
nology  to  make  sure  it  gets  off  the  shelf.  A  DARPA-like  translational  ‘‘connected
science’’  technology  development  role  is  not  currently  performed  at  DOE;  there  is
an institutional gap there. Given the need for breakthrough energy technologies and
transitioning  them—and  this  is  truly  the  grand  technology  challenge  of  our  time—
this  is  arguably  an  institutional  gap  that  should  be  considered.  This  would  be  the
central mission of an ARPA–E.

Let me emphasize that an ARPA–E cannot impose technology solutions on the pri-
vate sector. Its role will be to expand the options, and reduce the technology stand-
up barriers and risks, for private sector firms. It will need to work with the private
sector  to  evaluate  what  the  energy  technology  leverage  points  are,  what  technology
paths  could  have  maximum  impact,  and  collaboratively  explore  and  nurture  tech-
nology opportunities.
CAPTURING  THE  DARPA  CULTURE—THE  HYBRID  MODEL  AND  THE

DARPA RULESET:

The key to DARPA’s success has been its innovative culture. A DARPA clone will
not  work  unless  it  is  able  to  build  a  strong  innovation  culture.  DARPA  provides

some important lessons. A key has been its creation of ‘‘hybrid’’ collaborative teams,
combining  the  best  university  researchers  on  the  research  side  with  outstanding
firms (usually startups, small or mid-sized firms hungry for technology advance) on
the  development  side.  This  university-industry  hybrid  approach  has  proven  a  key
mechanism  for  DARPA’s  success  particularly  on  revolutionary  technology  break-
throughs—these teams create the capability for more readily crossing the ‘‘Valley of
Death.’’  DARPA  also  competes  its  research,  looking  for  and  regularly  obtaining  the
country’s  most  talented  research  teams.  An  ARPA–E  must  find  new  entrants  and
talent  to  supplement  the  existing  research  base  working  on  energy  R&D  if  we  are
to have the breakthroughs we need; a competitive hybrid model is a way to achieve
this.

Let  me  emphasize  that  you  can’t  legislate  culture—but  you  can  put  management
guidance 
legislation,  encourage  an  ARPA–E  to  hire  from  those  with
translational  research  experience  (basic  research  background  is  not  enough),  and
find  researchers  who  have  stood  up  or  worked  in  innovative  companies  and  know
how  to  bridge  R  and  D.  It  is  important,  too,  for  Congress  to  exercise  strong  over-
sight, particularly at the time of standup. It should also be pointed out that it takes
two  to  translate—the  Administration  is  going  to  have  to  affirmatively  want  to  do
this and to do it right for it to work.

Other  rules  from  the  DARPA  ruleset  that  create  its  culture  and  are  relevant  to

into 

an ARPA–E include:

• Keep  it  small  and  flexible:  DARPA  consists  of  only  100–150  professionals;
some have referred to DARPA as ‘‘100 geniuses connected by a travel agent.’’
• Create a flat non-hierarchical organization.
• Allow  the  entity  autonomy  and  freedom  from  bureaucratic  impediments:
DARPA operates outside the complex and slow government hiring process and
standard  government  contracting  rules,  which  gives  it  unusual  access  to  tal-
ent, plus speed and flexibility in organizing R&D efforts.

• Hire an eclectic, world-class technical staff.
• Create outstanding teams and networks among its researchers.
• Ensure  in  hiring  both  continuity  and  change:  DARPA’s  technical  staff  are
hired  or  assigned  for  3–5  years.  Like  any  strong  organization,  DARPA  mixes
experience  and  change.  It  retains  a  base  of  experienced  experts  that  know
their  way  around  DOD,  but  rotates  most  of  its  staff  from  the  outside  to  en-
sure fresh thinking and perspectives.
• Place leadership in the hands of outstanding program managers: In DARPA’s
words,  ‘‘The  best  DARPA  Program  Managers  have  always  been  freewheeling
zealots  in  pursuit  of  their  goals.’’  The  DARPA  director’s  most  important  job
historically  has  been  to  recruit  highly  talented  program  managers  and  then
empower  their  creativity  to  put  together  great  teams  around  great  advances.

• Emphasize acceptance of failure and willingness to take risk.
• Set  an  orientation  to  revolutionary  breakthroughs  in  a  connected  approach:
DARPA historically has focused not on incremental but radical innovation. It
emphasizes  high-risk  investment,  moves  from  fundamental  technological  ad-
vances to prototyping, and then hands off the production stage.

• Create a mix of connected collaborators from a range of disciplines.

OTHER ORGANIZATIONAL MODELS:

The Subcommittee requested that I review several other organizational models for

ARPA–E.

Wholly  Owned  Government  Corporation:  For  all  innovation  entities  in  the  busi-
ness  of  standing  up  new  technologies,  historically  the  best  model  has  been  to  put
them on a protective island free to experiment apart from contending bureaucracies,
but  to  ensure  a  strong  bridge  back  to  overall  organization  leaders  prepared  to  de-
fend the entity. If ARPA–E is not housed in DOE, an alternative option is to make
it  a  wholly-owned  government  corporation  entirely  outside  of  DOE.2 Government
corporations  appear  best  at  pursuing  limited  programs  of  limited  visibility  that  do
not  tangle  with  major  interests  or  other  parts  of  the  national  power  structure;
ARPA–E  will  likely  have  a  much  more  prominent  role  because  of  the  importance
of  energy  as  a  national  issue.  Programs  housed  in  government  corporations  that
reach  high  levels  of  visibility  can  flounder  without  strong  connections  to  national

26

leadership. If a government corporation model is selected for ARPA–E, a connection
to the government leadership could be attempted by naming the Secretary of Energy
as chairman of its board with government control of the board.

Locating  ARPA–E  in  a  government  corporation  assures  more  hiring  flexibility,
and  competitive  salary  structures  more  comparable  to  the  private  sector,  than  if  it
is  a  DOE  entity.  It  also  frees  the  entity  from  sometimes  slow-moving  government
procurement requirements. (DARPA offsets these problems by specific legislative au-
thorities, which could be authorized for ARPA–E.)

In-Q-Tel:  In-Q-Tel  was  established  in  1999  as  an  independent,  not-for-profit  cor-
poration  to  help  the  CIA  find,  obtain  and  deploy  new  technologies.  In-Q-Tel  at-
tempts to act as, in effect, a venture capital firm, making equity investments in and
contracting  with  IT  technology  firms  that  have  advances  In-Q-Tel  views  as  prom-
ising.  Although  financial  return  is  not  its  priority,  it  can  produce  investment  gains
when a company in its portfolio matures and exits through a buy-out or IPO; gains
must be reinvested in new firms with new technologies. In-Q-Tel believes its model
gives  it  a  flexibility  that  traditional  government  contract  approaches  do  not  allow,
to  gain  from  the  fast  pace  of  developments  in  the  IT  and  related  technology  fields.
Because In-Q-Tel is small it can’t really be accused, despite the financial positions
it  takes  in  emerging  firms,  of  affecting  markets  and  ‘‘picking  winners  and  losers.’’
If  an  ARPA–E,  is  stood  up  and  acquires  funding  comparable  to  DARPA’s,  however,
it would be operating at a far larger scale and its market interventions could affect
competitive  outcomes.  This  could  be  a  problem.  In  addition,  while  In-Q-Tel  is  oper-
ating  in  a  very  dynamic  largely  IT  sector  with  new  technologies  rapidly  emerging
from  firms,  that  is  not  the  situation  with  new  energy  technology.  ARPA–E,  there-
fore,  would  not  have  such  a  fertile  seedbed  to  operate  in.  An  ARPA–E  also  cannot
really  take  the  late  stage  venture  capital-type  approach  In-Q-Tel  uses  because  it
needs  to  nurture  breakthrough  technology  from  an  earlier  R&D  stage.  While  In-Q-
Tel  can  focus  on  technologies  already  being  stood  up  in  companies,  ARPA–E  can’t;
it  needs  to  back  R&D,  not  to  simply  tilt  later  stage  prototyping,  late  stage  design,
and products, as In-Q-Tel does. In-Q-Tel’s model is interesting for the tasks it faces,
but  the  potential  funding  scale  of  an  ARPA–E  could  be  viewed  as  overly  interven-
tionist  in  energy  technology  if  it  was  organized  like  In-Q-Tel,  and  it  faces  a  break-
through  technology  R&D  mission  not  a  late  stage  mission  like  In-Q-Tel.  The  tech-
nology  needs  in  the  two  sectors,  energy  and  intelligence,  don’t  allow  the  models  to
match.

Skunkworks: A third model would be a skunkworks, an engineering term that de-
scribes  a  group  separated  out  of  an  overall  organization  that  is  left  largely  autono-
mous  and  free  of  bureaucratic  constraints  to  build  advanced  technology  prototypes
and  products.  The  most  famous  example  is  aircraft  designer  Kelly  Johnson’s
skunkworks  at  Lockheed  which  created  such  famous  aircraft  as  the  P–80  Shooting
Star,  the  U–2,  the  SR–71  Blackbird,  and  the  F–117  Stealth  Fighter.  IBM’s  rapid
stand  up  of  its  original  PC  also  followed  a  skunkworks  model.  However,  the
skunkworks  concept  traditionally  has  been  aimed  at  the  engineering  stage  not  the
breakthrough translational research stage that an ARPA–E would also need to pur-
sue.  The  traits  of  autonomy  and  freedom  from  bureaucratic  controls  are  also  inher-
ent in the DARPA model.

HSARPA: The Science Committee, working with the Senate Committee on Home-
land  Security  and  Governmental  Affairs,  previously  authorized  a  DARPA  model  in
the context of the Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate. While the
Committee  provided  HSARPA  with  a  strong  and  flexible  authorization  closely  mod-
eled  on  DARPA’s  strengths,  HSARPA  has  never  been  adequately  utilized  or  imple-
mented.  It  currently  exists  as  a  shell  with  a  minimal  budget.  While  a  talented  ini-
tial  staff  was  recruited  for  HSARPA,  a  director  was  not  named  for  approximately
a year, so it lacked leadership for the start-up process in a competitive atmosphere.
HSARPA  was  never  allowed  autonomy  and  flexibility  and  instead  was  closely  con-
trolled by a budget and policy bureaucracy within the S&T Directorate that limited
HSARPA’s  funding  and  effectively  made  all  R&D  investment  and  award  decisions.
The failure to implement HSARPA as authorized illustrates several points. An inno-
vation culture is critical to success, and legislation alone can’t create this unless the
implementing agency shows real leadership, supports the new R&D mission, and is
determined  to  use  flexible  statutory  authorities  create  a  strong  entity.  An  ARPA–
E  will  need  its  own  budget  and  the  ability  to  control  it,  and  not  take  its  funding
from  other  competitor  agencies  which  will  dispute  the  diversion.  It  will  need  tech-
nical talent of great skill who also have experience at the helm of government R&D
entities  so  can  work  with  other  agency  bureaucracies.  And  it  will  need  a  clear  mis-
sion—breakthrough  technology  or  incremental  technology  (HSARPA  tried  both);

27

mixing  the  two  risks  having  the  former  become  the  bill-payer  for  the  latter.  The
HSARPA implementation problems also underscore the need for ongoing Committee
oversight over any implementation of an ARPA–E.
THE NEED TO OPERATE AT SCALE:

The  energy  sector  is  a  trillion  dollar  sector.  A  modestly  funded  R&D  effort  will
not  drive  transformational  shifts  in  this  sector,  one  of  the  largest  in  our  economy.
Federal  energy  R&D  has  fallen  by  more  than  half  since  a  high  point  in  1980,  and
private sector energy R&D similarly fell. These levels of R&D expenditure compare
poorly  to  other  major  federal  R&D  efforts  (the  Manhattan  Project,  the  Apollo
Project,  the  Carter-Reagan  Defense  buildup,  and  NIH  Doubling),3 which  in  many
ways  were  simpler  and  more  straightforward  from  an  economic  standup  basis  than
the complex technology focus for energy. Without significantly improved investment,
we  will  not  meet  our  need  for  energy  technology  advance,  despite  our  energy  secu-
rity and climate challenges. We are not going to get there on the cheap.

R&D  will  not  be  the  most  expensive  aspect  of  launching  new  energy  tech-
nologies—research  is  low  cost  compared  to  the  costs  of  prototyping  and  initial  pro-
duction.  An  ARPA–E  must  nurture  a  wide  range  of  technologies  in  a  wide  range  of
energy  and  efficiency  fields,  a  task  certainly  comparable  to  the  complexity  of
DARPA’s  task.  DARPA’s  budget  of  $3  billion  a  year,  provides  a  rough  benchmark
of  a  range  an  ARPA–E  should  reach,  after  an  initial  phase  in  period.  ARPA–E  will
need  to  operate  at  scale  or  it  will  not  be  taken  seriously  by  the  best  potential  re-
searchers  or  by  talented  potential  employees.  Unless  appropriators  as  well  as  au-
thorizers  are  prepared  to  find  generous  start-up  funding  for  ARPA–E  on  a  bipar-
tisan basis, the entity simply will not work.

If an effective macro-pricing system for carbon, such as a cap and trade program,
is  adopted  by  the  U.S.  because  of  climate  change  concerns,  this  program  could,  de-
pending  on  how  structured,  generate  revenues  of  up  to  many  billions  each  year,  as
a carbon permitting system is put in place. Although this macro-pricing step is still
likely some years away, when adopted it will not work unless there is a strong inno-
vation system foundation placed under it. Much of these new revenues will be need-
ed for R&D and to leverage large scale industry transition to non-CO2 emitting en-
ergy  systems.  It  is  important  that  innovation  system  reforms  be  adopted  now  if
these  future  resources  are  to  efficiently  and  soundly  invested  in  new  technologies.
ARPA–E is potentially part of that innovation institution story.
SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS:

1) Standing up new energy technologies is a major and complex challenge, per-
haps  the  most  difficult  technology  stand-up  challenge  we  have  faced.  Ever.
2) There  is  a  gap  in  the  federal  innovation  institutions  for  energy  around
translational  research.  There  is  a  need  for  new  institutional  arrangements
to  evolve  and  transition  new  breakthrough  technologies.  An  ARPA–E  mod-
eled on DARPA could help fill that gap.

3) If  an  ARPA–E  entity  is  formed  its  performance  will  require  high  perform-
ance  from  outstanding  new  research  entrants,  following  the  DARPA  hybrid
model of outstanding university and firm researchers.

4) The  culture  of  ARPA–E  will  determine  its  success;  authorizing  legislation
should  include  management  guidelines  following  key  points  in  the  DARPA
ruleset that have created an effective culture there.

5) ARPA–E could be stood up either inside DOE or outside it, through a feder-
ally  owned  corporation.  In  either  case  it  will  need  to  follow  an  island-bridge
model, performing R&D on an island creative autonomy but tied to the most
senior DOE leadership who can assist on research and political support.

6) Energy  R&D  is  underfunded  based  on  the  technology  needs  we  now  see;  we
need  to  expand  the  federal  R&D  portfolio  in  energy.  An  ARPA–E  will  need
to  operate  at  large  scale  to  achieve  success  in  helping  to  transform  our  en-
ergy technology menu.

7) An  ARPA–E  should  not  be  stood  up  unless  R&D  funding  is  available  ade-
quate to the significant size of the energy technology development task. The
Committee  should  seek  assurance  for  Appropriations  funding  and  Executive
Branch policy support if this program is to work well.

8) New energy technology will not be a short-term project. The program should

maintain a long-term focus.

Chairwoman  GIFFORDS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Bonvillian.  Dr.  Forrest,

please. Dr. Forrest, excuse me, could you push your button?
STATEMENT OF DR. STEPHEN R. FORREST, VICE PRESIDENT

FOR RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN

Dr.  FORREST.  Oh,  there  we  are.  Thank  you,  Madam  Chairman
Giffords  and  Ranking  Member  Inglis  for  this  invitation  to  testify.
Few  challenges  are  more  important  today  than  curbing  the
unsustainable  threat  to  our  fossil  fuels  dependent  energy  infra-
structure. To meet this challenge, which extends also to the threat
to  our  environment,  almost  all  agree  that  a  bold  and  broad  ap-
proach is needed.

Renewable,  inexpensive,  and  carbon-free  energy  solutions  must
be  found.  My  own  research  in  solar  power  and  solid-state  lighting
has  made  me  confident  that  many  economically  environmentally
sound  solutions  do  exist.  It  has  been  proposed  here  that  a  crucial
tool  for  meeting  these  challenges  is  the  establishment  of  ARPA–E,
a  flexible  and  independent  agency  at  DOE  to  sponsor  R&D  to  ad-
dress  the  grand  challenges  that  now  face  the  energy  sector,  but  in
structuring such an agency, we must take care to achieve the goals
of  independence  from  carbon-emitting  and  foreign  fuel  dominated
supply of fossil fuels.

My  personal  experience,  and  that  of  many  of  my  university  col-
leagues  around  the  Nation,  suggests  that  a  successful  model,  as
you heard twice before today, would be based on DARPA, which is
highly  mission-oriented,  and  nurtures  long-term,  innovative  R&D
investments,  in  ways  that  no  other  governmental  agency  has  been
so  successful  in  accomplishing.  DARPA  has  proven  to  be  a  critical
bridge between universities and industry who can provide the tech-
nological solutions to the needs of the Department of Defense.

While  DOD  is  its  client,  DARPA  research  has  inevitably  led  to
many commercial successes, of which most of us are well aware, for
example,  the  Internet,  cellular  telephony,  et  cetera.  Like  DARPA,
ARPA–E  should  position  itself  to  identify  the  largest  challenges
facing  our  energy  future.  How  can  our  energy  future  be  cut  loose
from  its  dependence  on  the  caprices  of  marginally  stable  foreign
countries, and how can it create a portfolio of energies that reduce
carbon emissions that are proving so destructive to our planet?

To  accomplish  this  task,  like  DARPA,  which  was  created  to
counter  the  Soviet  threat,  ARPA–E  must  have  autonomy  and  free-
dom  from  bureaucratic  impediments.  Its  mission  must  be  to  fund
collaborations  to  develop  new  technological  advances,  and  to  solve
a  wide  range  of  immense  and  common  problems.  This  entrepre-
neurial model for project identification will inevitably lead to a gen-
eration  of  robust  private  industry  that  provides  us  with  energy  al-
ternatives, while strengthening our domestic markets.

In  this  context,  universities  stand  to  play  a  key  role  as  incuba-
tors for highly innovative ideas that the private sector often cannot
afford  to  undertake.  ARPA–E  can  assume  the  role  of  connecting
universities  with  companies  that,  with  their  more  practical  per-
spectives,  could  bring  the  most  innovative  ideas  rapidly  into  the
marketplace.  I  would  point  out  that  DOE’s  current  research  port-
folio,  managed  by  the  Office  of  Science,  is  critical  to  advancing  in-
novation within the energy sector. Indeed, DOE provides two thirds
of  federal  investment  in  the  physical  sciences,  and  supports  thou-
sands  of  researchers  in  fields  such  as  computer  science,  engineer-
ing,  and  material  science.  However,  today’s  energy  predicament
needs a new perspective.

Primarily, DOE’s research structure is almost completely focused
on  funding  the  many  superb  National  Labs.  While  the  Labs  are
vital  in  areas  such  as  nuclear  weapons  development,  fundamental
physics, and material studies, these large scale facilities are not or-
ganized to conduct high risk transformational research whose func-
tion is primarily in changing the energy status quo in an agile and
unbureaucratic manner.

Furthermore,  programs  in  which  universities  and  National  Labs
are both allowed to compete are often dominated by the immediate
need  to  fully  support  operation  of  the  Labs.  As  a  result,  univer-
sities and the private sector are often inadequately resourced to ef-
fectively  contribute  to  solving  larger  problems,  thus  discouraging
the novel ideas that naturally emerge from their research.

Returning  to  the  DOD  model,  DARPA  rapidly  brings  innovation
to the military community at comparatively low cost by focusing al-
most  entirely  on  universities  and  the  private  sector.  For  example,
over  the  last  ten  years,  less  than  five  percent  of  DARPA’s  budget
has  gone  to  DOD  labs,  the  remainder  being  split  about  two  to  one
for  industry  and  academia.  To  achieve  the  same  success,  ARPA–E
must  follow  a  similar  model.  Its  focus  must  be  on  moving  innova-
tions  from  universities  into  industry,  and  then  from  industry  into
the marketplace.

The Labs’ institutional knowledge, however, should and can play
a  constructive  role,  by  helping  ARPA–E  define  the  very  challenges

in  the  National  Labs  has  long  played  this  role  of  guiding  energy
research.  As  advisor  to  ARPA–E,  it  will  continue  to  deepen  and
strengthen to our nation’s immense profit.

To  accomplish  its  mission,  ARPA–E  cannot  be  subordinate  to
other DOE entities. The Agency’s director should report directly to
the  Secretary  of  Energy,  again  following  the  highly  successful
DARPA  model,  where  the  Director  reports  to  the  Secretary  of  De-
fense.  Also,  a  cap  on  personnel  and  short  terms  of  service  would
keep  ARPA–E  dynamic,  and  would  ensure  a  continual  infusion  of
new ideas.

Obviously,  adequate  funding  is  essential.  In  tough  budgetary
times,  this  will  be  hard  to  come  by,  but  changing  our  energy  de-
pendencies  is  critical,  not  only  to  our  national  security,  but  also  to
our economy and our global competitiveness, hence the time to act
decisively  is  upon  us.  In  addition  to  Congress  providing  appropria-
tions that would not be found by taxing existing DOE agencies and
labs, independent revenue streams should be considered.

Thank you again for this opportunity to testify. I look forward to

contributing further in this debate.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF STEPHEN R. FORREST

Introduction

Chairman  Lampson,  Ranking  Member  Inglis  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,
thank  you  for  the  invitation  to  testify  today.  It  is  my  great  pleasure  to  contribute
to  the  ongoing  debate  over  the  establishment  of  a  new  energy  research  agency  at
the Department of Energy (DOE) to fill an unmet need: the nimble transfer of revo-
lutionary  energy  research  results  out  to  the  commercial  marketplace.  I  know  Con-
gress  first  started  working  on  this  issue  last  year  and  I  would  like  to  take  this  op-
portunity  to  commend  you  for  your  leadership  in  the  campaign  to  find  new  ways
to address American’s energy crisis.

As you may know, I joined the University of Michigan in January 2006 as its Vice
President  for  Research.  Prior  to  moving  to  Ann  Arbor,  I  held  several  positions  in
academia and in industry. Over the years I have worked at places ranging from Bell
Labs to USC and Princeton. I have more than 150 U.S. patents and have published
over 400 papers in scientific journals, many of them in the field of energy generation
and  use,  and  have  co-founded  several  successful  companies,  including  Sensors  Un-
limited, Epitaxx, Inc., Global Photonic Energy Corp., Universal Display Corporation,
and Apogee Photonics.

It  is  an  honor  to  be  part  of  higher  education,  but  with  that  honor  also  comes  re-
sponsibilities.  Universities  must  contribute  their  wealth  of  intellectual  depth  and
productivity  to  help  the  Nation  survive  what  will  be  a  disruptive  and  long-term
transition  in  its  energy  use  away  from  traditional  fossil  fuel  sources.  Thus,  one  of
first  acts  of  the  university  after  I  joined  as  Vice  President  for  Research  has  been
to initiate a unique research institute called the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Energy
Institute. It is named after our Physics Memorial Laboratory, home of the Ford Nu-
clear  Reactor  that  was  founded  by  the  Atoms  for  Peace  Program  started  in  the
1950s. The name of the institute historically honors University of Michigan alumni,
students  and  faculty  who  gave  their  lives  in  World  War  II.  The  new  Energy  Insti-
tute’s  goal  is  to  convene  world  experts  in  energy,  science  and  technology  to  explore
how  to  best  find  alternatives  to  fossil  fuel  to  meet  the  growing  the  energy  needs  of
our  nation.  Unlike  other  university-based  energy  research  centers,  our  institute
combines  science,  engineering,  economics  and  public  policy  expertise  to  address  the
challenges facing us. Its interdisciplinary culture is essential simply because, as the
Subcommittee knows all too well, the pathway to successful implementation of tech-
nological solutions in our communities is guided by public policy decisions, econom-
ics and societal change.
Our Nation’s Energy Crisis

There  are  few  contemporary  challenges  facing  the  Nation—and  the  world—more
threatening than the unsustainable nature of our current energy infrastructure. Our

communities are dependent upon the continuing availability of clean, affordable and
flexible energy resources.

Yet,  our  current  fossil  fuels-dependent  energy  infrastructure  is  unsustainable.
This  is  a  problem  with  potentially  catastrophic  consequences.  Global  oil  production
is  expected  to  peak  within  the  next  several  decades,  with  natural  gas  production
peaking soon thereafter. While there are substantial reserves of coal and tar sands,
the mining, processing and burning of these fossil fuels poses increasingly unaccept-
able biological and environmental risks, particularly within the context of global cli-
mate  change.  Furthermore,  the  security  of  our  nation  is  threatened  by  our  reliance
on foreign energy imports from unstable regions of the world.

At  this  critical  juncture,  a  bold  and  broad  approach  is  needed  to  radically  trans-
form how the United States meets its energy needs. Inexpensive and carbon-free en-
ergy solutions that are renewable must be found—and I am confident that they are
out there.

To  just  put  things  into  context,  in  20  minutes  enough  energy  to  power  the  earth
to  meet  mankind’s  demand  for  a  solid  year  is  provided  by  the  sun.  If  you  want  to
think  of  it  another  way,  if  we  constructed  six  solar  cell  fields  120  miles  on  a  side
and  placed  them  in  the  temperate  zones  of  the  Earth,  we  would  more  than  exceed
today’s demand for electrical energy. The problem with solar, and other forms of re-
newable energy, is that they still are not cost-competitive with that supplied by fos-
sil fuels purchased on the world’s markets.

To uncover practical applications of new ideas such as solar energy, we must har-
ness  the  brain  power  of  scientists  and  entrepreneurs  across  the  country.  The  prob-
lems  confronting  mankind  through  the  use  of  energy  are  far  greater  than  any  one
institution,  or  one  sector  of  our  scientific  and  industrial  infrastructure  can  solve.
This is not a time to go it alone.
ARPA–E: Essential to Meeting the Grand Challenge

I  strongly  support  the  National  Academies  recommendation  made  in  its  2005  re-
port,  Rising  Above  the  Gathering  Storm:  create  an  Advanced  Research  Projects
Agency  for  Energy,  or  ARPA–E—a  small  flexible  and  independent  federal  agency
that ‘‘would be charged with sponsoring research and development programs to meet
the Nation’s long-term energy challenges.’’ 1 According to the report, the new agency
‘‘would  support  creative  ‘out-of-the-box’  transformational  generic  energy  research.’’ 2
ARPA–E  would  be  modeled  on  the  Pentagon’s  successful  Defense  Advanced  Re-
search  Projects  Agency  (DARPA).  Created  in  response  to  the  Soviet  technological
threat,  DARPA  became  a  critical  bridge  between  the  defense  needs  of  the  time  and
experts  at  universities  and  private  corporations  who  could  provide  the  answers.3
While  its  main  client  has  been  the  Department  of  Defense,  DARPA  also  has  sup-
ported  the  collaborative  development  of  defense-based  technologies  for  the  commer-
cial  sector.  Over  the  course  of  its  history,  it  has  nurtured  long-term  innovative  re-
search  and  development  investments  in  a  way  that  private  industry  could  not  al-
ways  afford  to.  Through  DARPA’s  financial  awards  came  ground-breaking  techno-
logical  advances  such  as  the  Internet,  GaAs  technology  that  is  now  the  backbone
of cell phones, and wavelength division multiplexed high volume optical communica-
tions.

Today,  the  United  States  faces  an  even  bigger  and  more  tangible  threat  to  our
environment,  our  economic  and  intellectual  competitiveness,  and  our  national  secu-
rity.  A  new  independent  research  agency  at  DOE  would  bring  together  the  best
minds  from  around  the  country  to  guide  us  in  developing  solutions  for  the  future.
It would have the autonomy and freedom from bureaucratic impediments to encour-
age  flexibility  and  collaboration  to  solve  immense  and  common  problems  facing  the
energy  sector.  Ultimately,  funding  from  this  new  agency  would  lead  to  the  genera-
tion  of  a  robust  private  industry  that  would  provide  solutions  while  strengthening
our domestic markets.

Universities  also  stand  to  play  a  key  role  in  achieving  the  ARPA–E  agenda.  The
academic  environment  is  one  in  which  professors  are  rewarded  for  work  that  their
peers  believe  makes  significant  contributions  to  the  existing  foundation  of  knowl-
edge. For this reason, universities have traditionally been incubators for out-of-the-
box  ideas  that  the  private  sector  by  itself  often  cannot  afford  to  undertake  because
the  risks  may  outweigh  potential  payoffs.  Today,  universities  are  looking  for  solu-
tions  to  the  energy  independence  challenge  from  all  vantage  points—hydrogen  re-

search,  improved  lighting  sources,  biofuels,  energy  storage,  urban  planning,  semi-
conductors, alternative fuel cars, and solar cells to name a few.

An agile, mission-oriented ARPA–E would, like DARPA, connect universities with
large  and  small  industry  hungry  for  new  advances  in  technology.  With  their  more
practical perspectives, the companies can take the universities’ advances through to
commercialization. With ARPA–E as abridge between the two worlds, the best ideas
would rapidly emerge to find their place in the commercial marketplace.

Furthermore, ARPA–E sponsorship of university research would contribute to the
training of the workforce—helping to ensure a steady stream of future scientists, en-
gineers  and  entrepreneurs  who  would  continue  to  bring  talent  and  innovation  to
solving  the  energy  crisis  in  years  to  come.  As  America  fights  to  maintain  its  com-
petitive  edge  in  the  world,  this  next  generation  of  experts  will  become  increasingly
important.
DOE Research: Flexibility and Agility Needed

I  would  like  to  take  a  moment  to  talk  about  the  division  of  research  at  DOE.  As
you  know,  DOE  does  play  a  critical  role  in  advancing  U.S.  scientific  interests.
Today,  it  is  the  leading  source  of  federal  funds  and  resources  for  research  in  the
physical  sciences—providing  two-thirds  of  the  federal  investment  in  this  area.4 In
high  energy  and  nuclear  physics,  nuclear  medicine,  heavy  element  chemistry,  plas-
ma  physics,  and  magnetic  fusion,  DOE  is  the  primary  government  sponsor.  It  also
ranks high in overall federal support for research in computer science and engineer-
ing and sponsors significant research in biology and environmental sciences.

DOE’s  programs  and  facilities  have  promoted  the  work  of  thousands  of  research-
ers  and  played  vital  roles  in  many  significant  discoveries.  However,  to  face  today’s
energy  predicament  head  on,  the  Department  must  take  a  new  perspective  on  how
it supports research.

Essentially,  DOE’s  research  is  segmented  into  two  parts.  The  Office  of  Science
supports  basic  research.  Applied  research  is  conducted  in  the  offices  organized
around  fuel  sources,  such  as  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy,  Fossil  En-
ergy and Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.

These  research  programs  conduct  high  quality  and  important  work.  However,
gaps  and  shortcomings  exist.  For  example,  the  Office  of  Science,  which  has  long
been the key federal sponsor of physical sciences research, does not have the oppor-
tunity  to  cover  all  fields—often  leaving  important  disciplines,  such  as  nuclear  en-
ergy and environmental sciences, insufficiently addressed. Furthermore, there is lit-
tle  communication  or  coordination  between  the  offices  responsible  for  the  two  types
of  research  supported  by  DOE.  Another  critical  aspect  of  DOE  research  is  that  its
structure  is  almost  completely  focused  on  supporting  its  very  costly  National  Lab-
oratories,  to  the  exclusion  of  universities  and  the  private  sector.  Nearly  half  the
DOE  Science  research  and  development  budget  goes  to  operating  and  constructing
facilities.5

The  National  Laboratories  play  a  vital  role  in  a  wide  range  of  important  issues
such  as  nuclear  weapons  development,  energy  security,  computational  power,  new
energy  sources,  determining  molecular  structure,  and  homeland  security.  They  set
standards,  plot  specific  directions  the  energy  community  should  follow,  implement
solutions  and  provide  massive  and  often  costly  resources  to  bear  on  energy  prob-
lems. However, these large-scale facilities are not organized, nor structured, to con-
duct  high-risk  transformational  research  in  an  agile  and  unbureaucratic  manner—
nor  do  their  missions  cover  finding  revolutionary  ways  of  solving  energy  problems.
Furthermore,  historically,  federal  programs  in  which  universities  and  the  Na-
tional  Laboratories  are  both  allowed  to  compete  are  heavily  dominated  by  the  Lab-
oratories.  Particularly,  universities  are  often  not  provided  with  adequate  resources
to contribute to solving larger problems. This discourages creativity and novel ideas
that  naturally  emerge  from  the  enormous  intellectual  resources  that  exist  in  our
academic institutions.

In contrast, DARPA has succeeded because it brings ‘‘new blood’’ at comparatively
low  prices  into  the  defense  field  by  focusing  its  awards  almost  entirely  on  univer-
sities  and  individual  companies.  Indeed,  over  the  last  10  years,  less  than  five  per-
cent of the DARPA budget has gone to DOD labs, the reminder being split approxi-
mately  two  to  one  for  industry  and  academia.6 To  achieve  the  same  degree  of  sus-

tained  success  as  DARPA,  ARPA–E  must  follow  a  similar  model.  That  is,  to  guar-
antee that ARPA–E truly encourages cutting-edge research, the role of the National
Laboratories  in  this  new  agency  must  be  limited.  Only  in  unique  cases  should  the
national laboratories, in partnership with private and educational enterprises, be re-
cipients of ARPA–E funds.

The  institutional  knowledge  of  the  Labs,  however,  could  play  a  constructive  role.
With  their  advice,  ARPA–E  could  define  new  challenges  to  be  addressed.  These
projects  would  then  be  subcontracted  out  to  the  most  innovative  and  cost-effective
members of the broadest sector of the energy community.
Guaranteeing a Strong ARPA–E

Other  improvements  are  necessary  to  solidify  ARPA–E’s  leadership  in  innovative
energy  research.  I  will  briefly  touch  on  a  few  of  them.  For  example,  to  ensure  that
the  agency  does  not  become  subordinate  to  larger  DOE  research  and  development
entities,  the  agency’s  head  should  report  directly  to  the  Secretary  of  Energy.  This
again follows the DARPA model, where the Director reports to the Secretary of De-
fense. Also, a cap on the number of personnel and a relatively short term of service
would  help  keep  ARPA–E  dynamic  and  flexible,  supported  by  a  continual  infusion
of new ideas.

Furthermore, adequate funding would be essential. In a tight budget, this will be
hard  to  come  by,  but  the  necessity  of  acting  on  changing  our  energy  dependencies
is of deep national and global concern, and hence the time to act decisively is upon
us now. In addition to a ‘‘start-up’’ appropriation from Congress (one that would not
be found by ’taxing’ existing DOE agencies and labs), independent revenue streams
should be considered. These include a trust fund set up from federal oil and gas roy-
alties.7 Another  suggestion  is  adoption  of  a  macro-pricing  system  for  carbon,  such
as  a  cap  and  trade  program,  by  the  United  States  to  address  global  warming
threats.8

Finally,  steps  must  be  taken  to  ensure  that  DOE  does  not  then  use  ARPA–E’s
grants,  cooperative  agreements  or  contracts  to  return  funds  back  into  DOE.  DOE
should ensure that most of the agency’s budget is spent outside of the Department—
whether  at  universities,  large  energy  companies,  start-ups  or  consortia  of  academia
and industry.
Conclusion

Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to continuing
this discussion. Bringing alternative energy technologies to the marketplace is vital
as  the  Nation  faces  the  likely  collapse  of  our  traditional  fossil  fuel  economy  in  the
not-too-distant  future.  There  is  much  to  be  done,  with  no  apparent  simple  solution,
but  our  nations  health  can  only  be  assured  by  making  the  shift  away  from  a  domi-
nant  reliance  on  these  fuels  our  top  priority.  ARPA–E  would  play  a  central  role  in
finding the tools to make this shift.

There  is  no  doubt  that  successfully  creating  a  new  agency  at  DOE  will  face  pro-
found  challenges.  It  will  require  careful  writing  of  legislation  and  directives,  suffi-
cient  funding,  and  an  energetic  and  creative  staff.  But  it  must  be  done.  If  truly
given  the  opportunity,  ARPA–E  could  make  a  significant  contribution  to  our  na-
tional energy solutions.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  RICHARD  VAN  ATTA,  RESEARCH  STAFF
MEMBER,  SCIENCE  &  TECHNOLOGY  POLICY  INSTITUTE,  IN-
STITUTE FOR DEFENSE ANALYSES
Dr.  VAN ATTA.  Thank  you  very  much,  Madam  Chairman  and

Congressman Inglis.

I kind of come at this from the standpoint of a historical perspec-
tive,  and  I  guess  also  a  security  perspective,  since  I  have  been  in-
volved  in  national  security  issues  and  concerns  for  most  of  my  ca-
reer  at  the  Institute  for  Defense  Analyses,  and  now  at  the  Science
& Technology Policy Institute. My testimony here is my own views,
not of those two organizations.

We have heard a lot about the interrelationship between the uni-
versities  and  the  private  sector  and  finance  here,  and  in  fact,  the
generation  of  this  community  of  interest  around  key,  crucial  prob-
lems  is  one  of  the  major  advantages,  and  I  would  say  one  of  the
major  breakthroughs,  in  terms  of  innovation  that  DARPA  created
for the country.

In fact, one of the examples is the relationship between Stanford
University and Kleiner Perkins, with the development of a program
by DARPA, called the Stanford University Network, which became
Sun  Microsystems,  is  an  example  of  one  of  many  of  these  types  of
fundamental  new  relationships  that  was  created,  and  the  new
products and capabilities that came from that.

My  testimony  covers  the  following  questions.  First  of  all,  how
similar are the types of research that DARPA has engaged in over
the  past,  and  the  issues  of  addressing  energy  and  environmental
concerns.  Second,  what  are  DARPA’s  key  organizational  features
that  have  contributed  to  its  success,  and  could  those  features  be
replicated  within  the  political  and  economic  environment  sur-
rounding  energy  and  environment?  Third,  are  DARPA’s  cultural
features,  which  Bill  Bonvillian  specifically  referred  to,  and  central
to DARPA’s success, replicable within the energy environment?

Others  have  recognized  that  energy  and  environment  are  issues
that  are  very  different  in  some  ways  from  that  which  DOD  and
DARPA confronted. We had a well-defined, known enemy that gal-
vanized our issues and concerns, that in fact, we could say our na-
tion’s future was at stake. I think the panel here has tried to make
something  very  clear,  which  I  try  to  make  clear  in  my  classes  at
Georgetown on emerging technologies and security, and that is en-
ergy  and  environment  is  now  a  security  issue,  a  fundamental  en-

ergy security issue, that is worth the kind of investments and focus
of our attentions that we are talking about today.

My testimony covers several things that are historical in nature,
in  terms  of  the  DARPA  model.  What  is  the  DARPA  model?  Also,
the  basic  question  of,  which  DARPA?  Because  of  the  things  which
many people don’t realize or understand is that one of the key ele-
ments  of  DARPA  is  its  flexibility  and  adaptability.  It  has  moved
across the spectrum. It has done many different things, ranging all
the way from the most advanced research in things that are today
equivalent  to  nanotechnology  and  biotechnology  and  in  microelec-
tronics,  to  applications  of  true  weapons  systems  in  the  field,  as
with  the  DARPA  Project  AGILE  in  Vietnam.  So,  it  is  a  mistake  to
say  that  DARPA  is  only  one  thing.  It  is  a  flexible,  adaptive  entity,
seeking  to  apply  the  best  technological  innovation  to  the  most
daunting problems in the defense world.

DARPA’s  successes  are  well  known.  We  have  talked  about  the
Internet,  their  stand-off  precision  strike,  their  Stealth.  One  of  the
most  impressive  things  about  those  is  the  range  that  they  encom-
pass.  The  other  thing  is  the  scale  that  they  encompass.  Stealth
itself,  implemented  in  four  years  by  DOD  after  the  HAVE  BLUE
proof-of-concept  demonstration,  changed  the  way  in  which  we  con-
fronted the Soviets, and in fact, created a secret weapon. The Inter-
net,  through  the  iterative  development  of  new  technologies,  was
based  upon  J.C.R.  Licklider’s  vision  of  man-computer  symbiosis.
We are still getting there.

But we have to understand that these are all based upon visions
and  scopes  of  change-state  capabilities  that  would  make  a  funda-
mental  difference.  I  think  we  can  come  up  with  the  same  notions
in the energy world, in terms of changing the way in which we deal
with  our  energy  and  our  economy,  in  an  affordable  and  effective
livable manner.

And then, we can say that, you know, the DARPA activities that
we  have  talked  about,  in  terms  of  its  culture  and  all,  that  was  de-
veloped  over  time,  but  I  think  the  most  important  characteristics
of  that  which  we  can  talk  about,  are  first  of  all,  that  it  was  inde-
pendent  of  the  other  existing  organizational  structures.  In  that
case,  it  was  the  military  services.  The  military  service  R&D  struc-
tures dominated and were dominated by their own priorities—ships
and airplanes and tanks. DARPA created a whole new set of capa-
bilities, in terms of missiles and satellites, in terms of the Internet
and  communications  systems,  in  terms  of  joint  technological  capa-
bilities  like  the  stand-off  precision  strike  capabilities  with  the
JSTARS and things like that.

The services would not have done those. It was not in their inter-
est. It was not in their funding portfolios, and only a new organiza-
tion  on  the  outside  could  do  that.  I  think  when  we  look  at  the  en-
ergy environment, we can say that the existing energy systems and
providers  will  not  create  those  new  breakthrough  capabilities,  or
are  unlikely  to  do  so  without  this  kind  of  external  capability  pro-
viding support for it. We are talking here about what is often called
high risk, high payoff research. DARPA program managers are en-
couraged to challenge existing approaches, and seek results, rather
than  just  explore  ideas.  In  fact,  one  of  the  concerns  earlier  in  this
history  that  Johnny  Foster,  as  the  Department  of  Defense’s  Chief

Technology Officer of the DDR&E, exclaimed as a real concern was
that DARPA was becoming DOD’s NSF, and the point here is that
DARPA must stick to its mission. It must stick to its future of ap-
plying new technologies, not just playing with new things.

That  expectation  is  built  within  the  culture,  and  within  the  pro-
gram  managers  themselves.  It  is  designed,  in  that  sense,  to  be
something  very  different,  and  as  Peter  Cannon,  who  was  the  head
of Rockwell Sciences, in some work with me said, basically, in order
to  do  something  different,  you  have  got  to  do  something  different,
and that is what this is all about, I think.

If  you  think  that  the  current  incremental  and  traditional  ap-
proaches  of  science  and  technology  are  meeting  our  energy  prob-
lems, fine. If you don’t think so, then we have to think of new ways
of  doing  things.  We  need  to  innovate  in  our  organizational  struc-
tures, as well.

I  will  pass  over  the  discussions  I  have  about  the  origins  of
DARPA  and  all,  because  you  know  that,  and  we  have  heard  some
about  it.  I  do  want  to  emphasize  that  as  you  look  at  DARPA,  you
have to look at some key characteristics, and Bill has already men-
tioned some of those, and Dr. Forrest as well. First of all, it is inde-
pendent,  purposely  and  decisively  so,  meaning  that  it  only  reports
to  the  top,  and  it  doesn’t  go  through  a  lot  of  bureaucracy.  Keeping
it  from  that  bureaucracy  is  crucial  and  important.  It  is  lean  and
agile,  with  a  risk-taking  culture.  It  is  tolerant  of  failure,  and  open
to  learning.  DARPA  actually  iterates  ideas.  Dr.  Tether,  who  I  just
recently interviewed, talked about how they are revisiting artificial
intelligence,  under  the  terms  cognitive  computing.  They  did  work
in  AI,  succeeded  to  a  point,  came  back,  and  now  are  looking  at  it
again.  So  it  is  also  open  to  iterating  in  the  ideas  as  well.  It  has
learned to manage risk, not avoid it.

The  DARPA  program  manager  is,  in  fact,  the  key.  He  or  she  is
the  technical  champion  who  conceives  and  owns  the  program.  He
is  not  told  what  to  do,  though  he  does  have  to  have  approval  from
his  office  director,  and  from  the  DARPA  Director.  Once  he  starts
that  program,  it  is  his,  and  he  makes  it  happen,  and  he  has  to
make the choices involved in that. So, in essence, they are risk-tak-
ing,  idea-driven  entrepreneurs  heading  up  their  own  practice.  It  is
an  idea-driven  and  outcome-oriented  organization,  where  the  gat-
ing  notion  isn’t  that  the  idea  is  well-proven,  but  that  it  has  high
prospects  for  making  a  difference.  The  research  is  outcome-driven,
to  achieve  results  towards  an  identifiable  goal,  not  to  pursue
science per se.

So, when I look at this, and I say what kinds of things are going
on,  or  have  gone  on  in  DARPA  that  have  made  it  successful,  I
would  say  is  that  it  is  not  identified  as  success  because  of  a  par-
ticular program or a particular technology, but rather, it is success-
ful for its ability to rapidly take on and assess new ideas and con-
cepts, directing towards daunting challenges, and evaluate and test
those in a rapid manner.

Those  are  the  kind  of  things  that  we  want  to  create.  So,  if  we
want  to  do  that,  what  are  the  kind  of  roles?  First  of  all,  there  is
a  fundamental  role  of  finding  the  new  ideas,  turning  basic  science
into  emerging  technologies.  Second  of  all,  exploring  disruptive  ca-
pabilities, pursuing them to a point of saying can they make a dif-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 18:32 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 034719 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\042607\34719 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

37

ference,  how  can  they  make  a  difference?  Thirdly,  developing  a
technology strategy around those potential change-state ideas, that
can  then  lead  to  a  broader  overall  strategy.  And  finally,  fostering
a  revolution  or  fundamental  transformation  in  the  domain  of  tech-
nology.

So, I would conclude by saying first of all, the kind of things that
made  DARPA  successful,  and  would  make  an  ARPA–E  successful
if allowed to do so, would be one, to create the technology surprise,
don’t  just  seek  it  or  avoid  it,  just  don’t  seek  to  avoid  it.  Second  of
all,  build  a  community  of  change-state  advocates,  which  is  what
Bill  and  Mr.  Denniston  and  all  pointed  to,  creating  the  inter-
relationship  of  the  people  who  want  to  make  a  difference.  DARPA
had  more  success  in  terms  of  finding  a  community  of  innovative
people, who could both think of the ideas and implement and inte-
grate  those  ideas,  than  any  other  organization  I  can  think  of.
Third,  defining  fundamental  challenges,  developing  solution  con-
cepts,  working  in  concert  with  experts,  and  then,  developing  dem-
onstrations of them.

This demonstration role is crucial, but you also have to be careful
to  bound  those,  so  that  you  don’t  become  caught  in  the  massive
draw  of  funding  major  demonstrations  that  keep  asking  for  more
and  more  money.  DARPA  has  had  a  problem  itself  in  modulating
the  scale  and  scope  of  those  demonstration  programs,  and  in  the
energy  area,  these  could  be  daunting  and  very  expensive.  I  think
you  will  have  to  find  a  way  of  doing  what  DARPA  did,  which  says
our  demonstrations  are  proof-of-concept.  Implementation  dem-
onstrations  need  to  go  somewhere  else.  Finding  mechanisms  to  do
that  is  a  crucial  issue,  and  one  that  goes  to  the  point  that  Con-
gressman Inglis was saying, which is that commercialization imple-
mentation mode.

Something  I  want  to  emphasize,  and  that  is,  DARPA  does  not
work  in  a  vacuum.  It  works  in  a  science  and  technological
ecostructure,  both  in  the  DOD  and  outside,  in  terms  of  NSF,  et
cetera. You cannot expect an ARPA–E to succeed if it is only there
by itself. It has to be done within a strategy, and within a concept
of  leadership,  drawing  upon  the  science  and  technology  strengths
across the whole country.

I  hope  these  ideas  have  at  least  given  you  some  concepts  of  the
prospects of successfully implementing an ARPA–E. I will be happy
to answer any questions you have.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RICHARD VAN ATTA1

With energy and climate issues increasingly the focus of public policy discussions,
the  notion  that  a  special  research  organization—referred  to  as  ARPA–E—should  be
created  has  been  proposed  in  several  venues,  including  H.R.  364.  More  specifically,
there have been calls to create a new entity, modeled on the notably successful De-
fense  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency,  DARPA,  to  perform  advanced  R&D  di-

rected at finding technological solutions to energy security and environmental chal-
lenges.2

Having  spent  a  fair  amount  of  time  looking  at  DARPA’s  research  program  over
the years I have been asked what would it take for such an organization to be estab-
lished and be successful drawing from the historical perspective of the unique orga-
nization  that  it  would  emulate—DARPA.  This  will  be  the  focus  of  my  remarks
today.

Some key questions we might consider are:

1. How  similar  are  the  type  of  research  tasks  of  DARPA  to  those  entailed  in

addressing energy and the environment and how are they different?

2. What are DARPA’s key organizational features that have contributed to suc-
cess and could those features be replicated within the political and economic
environment  surrounding  energy  and  the  environment  in  the  executive
branch, Congress, and private industry?

3. Are  DARPA’s  ’cultural  features’  that  have  been  central  to  its  success  repro-
ducible  under  the  various  possible  contemporary  arrangements  for  address-
ing energy and the environment?

Understanding DARPA

We begin this discussion with the following questions:

— What  is  the  ‘‘DARPA  Model,’’  which,  as  we  will  explain,  raises  the  question

‘‘Which DARPA?’’

— What was the original charter of DARPA and how has it evolved?
— What have been DARPA’s ‘‘successes’’—why is it so well regarded?
— What  is  the  basic  ‘‘motif’’  of  DARPA  success  and  what  are  key  factors  in

achieving success?

— What  is  relevance  of  DARPA  model  for  other  policy  areas—particularly  en-

ergy and climate research?

The ‘‘DARPA Model’’

DARPA’s primary mission is to foster advanced technologies and systems that cre-
ate  ‘‘revolutionary’’  advantages  for  the  U.S.  military.  Consistent  with  this  mission,
DARPA is independent from the military Services and pursues higher-risk research
and  development  (R&D)  projects  with  the  aim  of  achieving  higher-payoff  results
than  those  obtained  from  more  incremental  R&D.  DARPA  program  managers  are
encouraged  to  challenge  existing  approaches  to  war  fighting  and  to  seek  results
rather than just explore ideas. Hence, in addition to supporting technology and com-
ponent development, DARPA has on occasion funded experiments in the integration
of large-scale ‘‘systems of systems’’ in order to demonstrate what we call today ‘‘dis-
ruptive capabilities.’’

Underlying  this  ‘‘high-risk—high  payoff’’  motif  of  DARPA  is  a  set  of  operational
and organizational characteristics that many have referenced. These include its rel-
atively  small  size;  its  lean,  non-bureaucratic  structure;  its  focus  on  potentially
change-state technologies; its highly flexible and adaptive research program.
What  is  important  to  understand  at  the  outset  is  that  in  contrast  to  the
then  existing  Defense  research  environment,  ARPA  was  manifestly  dif-
ferent.  It  did  not  have  labs.  It  did  not  focus  on  existing  military  requirements.  It
was  separate  from  any  other  operational  or  organizational  elements.  It  was  explic-
itly chartered to be different, so it could do fundamentally different things than had
been done by the Military Service R&D organizations.

The  reason  for  this  dramatic  departure  was  that  President  Eisenhower  and  his
key  advisors  had  determined  that  the  existing  R&D  system  had  failed  to  respond
to  the  realities  of  the  emerging  national  security  threat  embodied  by  the  Soviet
Union. This threat was manifest in a crescendo event—the launching in 1958 of the
Sputnik satellite. The response to this was not only the creation of a research entity
to perform research that others had not adequately pursued, but to embed this orga-
nization within a newly created oversight structure reporting to the Secretary of De-
fense—namely the Director, Defense Research and Engineering, or DDR&E.

2 The DARPA model—sometimes referred to as ARPA–E, or E–ARPA—has been suggested in
several venues, most notably in the National Academies’ Rising Above the Gathering Storm, En-
ergizing  and  Employing  America  for  a  Brighter  Economic  Future,  National  Academies,  Com-
mittee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPUP), 2006.

DARPA’s origins: Strategic Challenges ∼1958

ARPA3 was initially chartered in response to the orbiting of the Sputnik satellite,
which  raised  the  specter  of  the  Soviet  Union  as  a  technological  as  well  as  political
threat  to  the  United  States.  Sputnik  itself  demonstrated  that  the  USSR  not  only
had  ambitions  in  space,  but  also  had  developed  the  wherewithal  to  launch  missiles
with  nuclear  capabilities  to  strike  the  continental  United  States.  Therefore,  at  the
outset  ARPA  was  focused  initially  on  three  key  areas  as  Presidential  Issues:  space,
missile defense and nuclear test detection.

• Regarding the first issue, space, soon after its birth a large element of ARPA
was  spun  off  to  become  NASA,  based  on  President  Eisenhower’s  determina-
tion that space research should not be directly under the DOD.4

• By  1959  ARPA  had  assignments  on  ballistic  missile  defense  (DEFENDER)
and nuclear test detection (VELA), and also pursued research in solid propel-
lant  chemistry,  and  materials  sciences.  Soon  after  ARPA  initiated  a  program
on  information  processing  ‘‘techniques’’  with  a  focus  on  possible  relevance  to
command  and  control  also  began.  These  became  the  major  elements  of
ARPA’s program over the next decade.

• Based  on  the  initiative  of  Director  of  Defense  Research  and  Engineering
(DDR&E), John S. Foster, a counter-insurgency program (AGILE) was started
as the Vietnam War heated up.

DARPA  was  first  established  as  a  research  and  development  organization  imme-
diately  under  the  Secretary  of  Defense,  reporting  to  the  Director  of  Defense  Re-
search  and  Engineering,  then  the  third  highest  official  in  the  department  with  the
mission to

— assure that the U.S. maintains a lead in applying state-of-the-art technology
for military capabilities
and
— prevent technological surprise from her adversaries.

DARPA’s Unique Mission

ARPA was created to fill a unique role, a role which by definition and in its incep-
tion put it into contention and competition with the existing Defense R&D establish-
ment.  As  the  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency,  ARPA  was  differentiated  from
other  organizations  by  an  explicit  emphasis  on  ‘‘advanced’’  research,  generally  im-
plying  a  degree  of  risk  greater  than  more  usual  research  endeavors.  Former  ARPA
Director  Dr.  Eberhardt  Rechtin  emphasized  that  research,  as  opposed  to  develop-
ment,  implies  unknowns,  which  in  turn  implies  the  possibility  of  failure,  in  the
sense that the advanced concept or idea that is being researched may not be achiev-
able. Were the concept achievable with little or no risk of failure, the project would
not be a research effort, but a development effort.

DARPA  over  its  history  has  grappled  with  how  to  interpret  or  pursue  advanced
research, both in contrast to the broad array of research being conducted within and
for DOD, and relative to its perception of the needs at the time.

Recently DARPA stated its mission as follows:

DARPA is a Defense Agency with a unique role within DOD. DARPA is not tied
to  a  specific  operational  mission:  DARPA  supplies  technological  options  for  the
entire  Department,  and  is  designed  to  be  the  ‘‘technological  engine’’  for  trans-
forming  DOD. . ..  a  large  organization  like  DOD  needs  a  place  like  DARPA
whose  only  charter  is  radical  innovation.  DARPA  looks  beyond  today’s  known
needs and requirements.

It is clear from DARPA’s history that within the scope of this mission the empha-
sis and interpretation of advanced research have varied, particularly in terms of (1)

3 The  original  name,  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency,  ARPA,  was  changed  in  1972  to  De-
fense  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency,  DARPA.  Briefly  in  1993–95  the  Clinton  Administra-
tion  reverted  back  to  ARPA,  but  in  1996,  the  Congress  mandated  that  the  name  be  changed
back to DARPA. In historical references I use the name of the organization at that time, either
ARPA or DARPA, but for general discussion the current title, DARPA, is used.

4 Herbert  York  states  it  was  well  understood  in  ARPA  that  its  broad  role  in  space  programs
was  temporary,  with  the  creation  of  NASA  already  in  the  works  both  in  the  White  House  and
in  Congress,  see  Herbert  York,  Making  Weapons,  Talking  Peace,  Basic  Books,  New  York,  1987,
p. 143.

the degree and type of risk5 and (2) how far to go toward demonstration of applica-
tion.  At  times  with  changing  circumstances  the  agency  has  had  to  reassess  its
project mix and emphasis due to determinations both internally and within the Of-
fice of the Secretary of Defense regarding the appropriate level of risk and the need
to  demonstrate  application  potential.  In  a  sense  these  somewhat  contradictory  im-
peratives  serve  as  the  extreme  points  on  a  pendulum’s  swing.  As  DARPA  is  pulled
toward  one  of  the  extremes,  often  by  forces  beyond  itself,  including  Congressional
pressures, there are countervailing pressures stressing DARPA’s unique characteris-
tics to do militarily relevant advanced research.

At  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum,  as  projects  demonstrate  application  potential,
DARPA runs into another set of tensions, not with the researcher, but with the po-
tential  recipient  of  the  research  product.  Given  that  the  ideas  pursued  are  innova-
tive,  perhaps  revolutionary,  they  imply  unknowns  to  the  user  in  terms  of  how  they
will  be  implemented  and  how  this  implementation  will  affect  their,  the  implemen-
ter’s,  overall  operations.  To  this  end  the  potential  users  seek  to  reduce  their  uncer-
tainty,  in  what  is  a  highly  risk-intolerant  environment,  by  encouraging  DARPA,  or
some  other  development  agency,  to  carry  forward  the  concept  until  these  risks  are
minimized,  or  simply  ignoring,  delaying  or  stretching  out  its  pursuit.  While  achiev-
ing transition can be increased by additional risk reducing research, this also entails
substantial additional cost and raises the issue of mission boundaries.

There have been several occasions in DARPA’s history when its management has
determined  that  it  has  done  enough  in  an  area  to  demonstrate  the  potential  of  a
specific  concept—such  as  Unmanned  Air  Vehicles  (UAVs)—and  that  it  is  thus  time
for  others  to  fund  development  of  its  application  and  acquisition.  These  decisions
have  at  times  resulted  in  a  potential  concept  becoming  a  victim  of  the  ‘‘valley  of
death,’’ with the application either failing to be realized, or, as in the case of UAVs,
taking  over  a  decade  with  special  high-level  attention  of  OSD  to  come  to  fruition.
Developing mechanisms to engage potential ‘‘customers’’ in an emerging concept and
working  with  these  prospective  developers  and  users  as  the  ideas  mature  is  a  key
aspect of DARPA project management.
DARPA’s Key Characteristics

It was recognized from the outset that DARPA’s unique mission required an orga-

nization with unique characteristics. Among the most salient of these:

• It is independent from Service R&D organizations

DARPA  neither  supports  a  Service  directly  nor  does  it  seek  to  implement  solu-
tions  to  identified  Service  requirements.  Its  purpose  is  to  focus  on  capabilities  that
have not been identified in Service R&D and on meeting defense needs that are not
defined explicitly as Service requirements. This does not mean that DARPA does not
work  with  the  Services,  but  it  does  mean  that  it  does  not  work  the  requirements
that drive Service R&D.

• It is a lean, agile organization with risk-taking culture

DARPA’s  charter  to  focus  on  ‘‘high  risk;  high  payoff’’  research  requires  that  it  be
tolerant  of  failure  and  open  to  learning.  It  has  had  to  learn  to  manage  risk,  not
avoid it. Because of its charter, it has adopted organizational, management and per-
sonnel  policies  that  encourage  individual  responsibility  and  initiative,  and  a  high
degree  of  flexibility  in  program  definition.  This  is  one  reason  that  DARPA  does  not
maintain any of its own labs.

A  primary  aspect  of  DARPA’s  lean  structure  is  that  it  centers  on  and  facilitates
the  initiative  of  its  Program  Managers.  The  DARPA  Program  Manager  is  the
technical  champion  who  conceives  and  owns  the  program.  As  the  Program

5 Risk  has  several  dimensions:  (1)  lack  of  knowledge  regarding  the  phenomena  or  concept
itself; (2) lack of knowledge about the applications that might result if the phenomena or concept
were understood; (3) inability to gauge the cost of arriving at answers regarding either of these;
and  (4)  difficulty  of  determining  broader  operational  and  cost  impacts  of  adopting  the  concept.
As answers about (1) become clearer through basic research, ideas regarding applications begin
to  proliferate,  as  do  questions  of  whether  and  how  to  explore  their  prospects.  DARPA  is  at  the
forefront  of  this  question  and  has  the  difficult  job  of  determining  whether  enough  is  known  to
move  toward  an  application  and,  if  so,  how  to  do  so.  At  times  this  can  be  very  controversial,
as  researchers  may  feel  they  do  not  know  enough  to  guarantee  success  and  are  concerned  that
‘‘premature’’ efforts may in fact create doubts about the utility and feasibility of the area of re-
search,  resulting  in  less  funding  and  (from  their  perspective)  less  progress.  DARPA,  however,
has  a  different  imperative  than  the  researcher  to  strive  to  see  what  can  be  done  with  the  con-
cepts  or  knowledge,  even  if  it  risks  exposing  what  is  not  known  and  what  its  flaws  are.  This
tension  is  endemic  in  DARPA’s  mission  and  at  times  has  put  it  at  odds  with  the  very  research
communities that it sponsors.

Manager  is  the  guiding  intelligence  behind  the  program,  the  most  important  deci-
sions  of  DARPA’s  few  Office  Directors  are  the  selection  of  and  support  of  risk-tak-
ing, idea-driven Program Managers dedicated to making the technology work.

• It is idea-driven and outcome-oriented

The coin of the realm at DARPA is promising ideas. The Project Manager succeeds
by  convincing  others—the  Office  Director  and  the  DARPA  Director—that  he  or  she
has  identified  a  high  potential  new  concept.  The  gating  notion  isn’t  that  the  idea  is
well-proven, but that it has high prospects of making a difference. The DARPA Pro-
gram Manager will seek out and fund researchers—usually in competition with one
another—within  U.S.  defense  contractors,  private  companies,  and  universities  to
bring  the  incipient  concept  into  fruition.  Thus,  the  research  is  out-come  driven  to
achieve results toward identified goals, not to pursue science per se. The goals may
vary  from  demonstrating  that  an  idea  is  technically  feasible  to  providing  proof-of-
concept for an operational capability. To achieve these results the Program Manager
needs  to  be  open  to  competing  approaches,  and  be  adroit  and  tough-minded  in  se-
lecting among these.
Which DARPA?

While the concept of DARPA as a ‘‘high-risk—high pay-off’’ organization has been
maintained,  it  also  has  been  an  intrinsically  malleable  and  adaptive  organization.
Indeed  DARPA  has  morphed  several  times.  DARPA  has  ‘‘re-grouped’’  iteratively—
often after its greatest ‘‘successes.’’ The first such occasion was soon after its estab-
lishment  with  the  spinning  off  of  its  space  programs  into  NASA.  This  resulted  in
about half of the then ARPA personnel either leaving to form the new space agency,
or returning to a military service organization to pursue military-specific space pro-
grams.  A  few  years  later  then  DDR&E  John  S.  Foster  required  ARPA  to  transition
its  second  largest  inaugural  program—the  DEFENDER  missile  defense  program—
to  the  Army,  much  to  the  consternation  of  some  key  managers  within  ARPA.  Also
early  in  its  history  ARPA  was  tasked  by  Foster,  acting  at  the  behest  of  Secretary
of  Defense  McNamara,  to  conduct  a  program  of  applied  research  in  support  of  the
military effort in Viet Nam. At the same time ARPA began what was to become its
most  famous  program—the  information  technology  program  that  among  other
things spawned the Internet.

More  important  than  the  variety  of  the  programs  is  that  they  demonstrate  the
quickness  that  DARPA  took  on  a  new  initiative  and  also  how  rapidly  its  programs
will move—sometimes more rapidly than its supporters within DARPA desire. How-
ever,  rather  than  particular  programs  or  technologies  becoming  the  identifier  of
what  DARPA  is,  its  key  distinguishing  characteristic  is  its  rapidly  taking  on  and
assessing  new  ideas  and  concepts  directed  at  daunting  military  challenges  or  over-
arching  application  prospects.  While  the  dwell  time  on  new  ideas  may  vary  and
DARPA  may  return  to  the  concept  iteratively  over  its  history—most  notably  with
its return to missile defense in the 1970s leading to SDI in the 1980s—its hallmark
is to explore and create new opportunities, not perfect the ideas that it has fostered.

This quick synopsis of DARPA’s history leads to me to the conclusion:

There is not and should not be a singular answer on ‘‘what is DARPA’’—
and if someone tells you that—they don’t understand DARPA.

DARPA’s  unique  focus  is  ‘‘high  risk—high  payoff’’  research.  But,  clearly  this  has
not  been  the  only  focus.  Moreover,  the  content  and  focus  of  that  research  has
changed  with  the  circumstances  and  need.  A  crucial  element  of  what  has  made
DARPA  a  special,  unique  institution  is  its  ability  to  re-invent  itself,  to  adapt,  and
to avoid becoming wedded to the last problem it tried to solve.
DARPA roles

While  we  have  emphasized  DARPA’s  adaptability,  this  is  not  to  say  that  there
aren’t some underlying elements to what DARPA does. While there have been some
additional  ad  hoc  activities  thrown  in  over  time,  such  as  its  oversight  of
SEMATECH,  DARPA  has  had  significant  roles—with  a  varying  mix—in  the  fol-
lowing:

• Turning basic science into emerging technologies
• Exploring ‘‘disruptive’’ capabilities (military and more generic)
• Developing technology strategy into a Defense strategy
• Fostering revolution or fundamental transformation in a domain of technology

application (e.g., the Internet or stand-off precision strike).

Key elements of DARPA’s success

There  are  several  key  elements  in  DARPA’s  succeeding  in  its  unique  role  as  an

instigator of radical innovation.

• Create surprise; don’t just seek to avoid it

DARPA mission is to investigate new emerging technological capabilities that
have prospects to create disruptive capabilities. It is differentiated from other
R&D  organizations  by  a  charter  that  explicitly  emphasizes  ‘‘high-risk,  high
payoff’’ research.

• Build communities of ‘‘change-state advocates’’

DARPA program managers may often themselves foster a specific concepts or
technological approach that they seek to explore and develop. But they almost
never  are  they  main,  let  alone  sole,  investigator  of  the  notion.  Rather  it  is
DARPA’s motif to instigate cooperation among a group of forward-looking re-
searchers and operational experts. In this sense, DARPA’s success depends
on it being a leader and catalyst in developing this community of in-
terest.

• Define  challenges,  develop  solution  concepts,  and  demonstrate  them
One aspect of DARPA’s success has been efforts to define strategic challenges
in  detail.  Since  its  inaugural  Presidential  Issues,  DARPA  has  been  problem
focused, seeking breakthrough change-state approaches to overcome daunting
issues.  This  has  been  true  in  the  military  realm  from  the  outset.  DARPA-
sponsored  researchers  under  Project  DEFENDER  conducted  detailed  assess-
ments  of  intercontinental  missile  phenomena  for  both  defense  and  offense.6
Later  in  the  late  1970s,  DARPA  funded  studies  to  understand  how  the  War-
saw  Pact  was  postured  against  Western  Europe  in  order  to  determine  how
technology  could  provide  a  means  to  offset  the  Warsaw  Pact’s  numerical  and
geographic advantages. This planning led to DARPA research in both stealth
and  stand-off  precision  strike,  which  provided  the  basis  for  Secretary  of  De-
fense Harold Brown’s and Director of Defense Research and Engineering Wil-
liam Perry’s ‘‘Offset Strategy.’’ 7
Such  detailed  conceptual  work  also  facilitated  DARPA’s  non-military  re-
search—explicitly  that  in  information  technology.  JCR  Licklider  came  to
DARPA  as  head  of  the  Information  Processing  Techniques  Office  with  a  vi-
sion  on  man-computer  symbiosis  that  grew  in  specificity  as  he  collaborated
with  others,  especially  Robert  Taylor,  to  present  a  perspective  of  internetted
computers  providing  capabilities  for  collaboration  and  data  interchange
amongst  researchers.8 Overtime  IPTO  grew  this  initial  concept  into  an  in-
creasingly inter-connected strategy.

Tension between DARPA roles

DARPA  has  been  a  pursuer  of  new  breakthrough  technologies  independent  of  de-
fined  needs.  It  also  has  been  a  developer  of  concept  prototypes  and  demonstrations
that address needs (but not defined requirements). While complementary, these are
substantially  different  roles  requiring  different  management  approaches  and  dif-
ferent types of researchers. The first type of endeavor requires an exploratory, some-
what unstructured approach seeking out alternatives amongst competing ideas. The
latter  focuses  on  taking  a  specific  set  of  emerging  capabilities  and  combining  them
into  a  demonstration  of  proof-of-concept.  Such  demonstrations  are  generally  larger
in  scale  and  more  resource  intensive  than  exploratory  research.  Moreover,  rather
than exploratory, they are aimed at assessing the merit of a specific concept. Indeed,
demonstration  prototype  efforts  can  be  ‘‘resources  sumps,’’  as  they  are  both  uncer-
tain  and  costly.  Therefore  the  DARPA  Director  has  needs  to  attentively  oversee
these while maintaining and protecting the more exploratory research efforts.

6 For  example,  in  the  1960s  and  1970s  DARPA  funded  studies  at  the  then  new  Institute  for
Defense  Analyses  on  missile  offense  and  defense  first  under  the  STRAT–X  project  on  ICBM  of-
fense-defense  followed  by  then  PEN–X  study  which  assessed  both  U.S.  and  Soviet  capabilities
to penetrate missile defense systems.

DARPA’s Successes

Over  the  nearly  fifty  years  since  its  inception  DARPA  has  had  several  major  ac-
complishments  that  distinguish  it  as  an  innovative  organization.  While  these  have
been  recounted  elsewhere,  it  may  be  useful  here  to  summarize  to  illustrate  the
scale,  scope,  and  varying  types  of  innovative  capabilities  that  DARPA  helped  to  in-
stigate.9
3rd Generation Info Tech-the Creation of Interactive Information10

The singularly most notable technology accomplishment that DARPA is known for
is the development of what is now known as modern computing, as embodied in the
personal  computer  and  the  Internet.  While  this  achievement  had  its  origins  in  re-
markable  vision  of  one  man,  JCR  Licklider,  its  coming  to  fruition  speaks  volumes
for the nature of DARPA as an organization and the willingness of its management
to support and nurture the pursuit of such an extraordinary perspective.

The  vision  that  Licklider  brought  to  DARPA  was  one  of  a  totally  revolutionary
concept  of  computers  and  how  they  could  be  used.  He  foresaw  that  rather  than
being  fundamentally  highly  automated  calculating  machines,  computers  could  be
employed  as  tools  in  supporting  humans  in  creative  processes.11 However,  to  do  so
would require entirely new, yet non-existent computer capabilities that included the
underpinnings for:

• interactive computers
• Internetted computing
• Virtual reality
• Intelligent systems

Licklider’s  extraordinary  notion  of  ‘‘man-computer  symbiosis’’  was  a  fundamental
vision  that  foresaw  using  new  types  of  computational  capabilities  to  achieve  first
augmented human capabilities and then possibly artificial intelligence.

He then identified prerequisites that were the underpinnings for this entirely new

approach to using computers, which included:

— Entirely  new  types  of  data-processing  equipment  and  programs  that  facili-

tated researchers interacting with their computers in real-time.

— Taking  advantage  of  the  speed  mismatch  between  the  computer,  which  can
perform  nearly  instantaneously  and  the  slower  and  more  deliberative
human.  To  overcome  this  mismatch,  the  computer  must  divide  its  time
amongst several users [the concept of time-sharing].

— The  creation  of  the  ‘‘Thinking  Center’’  ‘‘a  Network  of  libraries  and  informa-
tion  storage  connected  by  wideband  communications. . .to  individual  users’’
— Memory  and  memory  organization  developed  and  optimized  for  search  and

retrieval

— Entirely different computer language that is ‘‘goal oriented’’ rather than step

by step process oriented

— Completely  novel  input  and  output  mechanisms  to  overcome  the  cum-
bersome  punch  cards  and  reams  of  computer  printout  with  such  radical  no-
tions as touch-screen displays and even speech recognition.

Licklider brought these inchoate notions to DARPA when he was named Director
of  its  Information  Processing  Techniques  Office  (IPTO).  He  brought  a  powerful  vi-
sion  of  what  could  be  and  used  this  as  the  basis  for  sustained  investment  in  the
underlying technologies to achieve the vision. These investments were aimed at ad-
venturous innovators in academia and in industry—mostly small enterprises on the
fringe of the information processing industry then dominated by IBM, such as Bolt,

Baranek  and  Newman  (BBN).  Moreover,  there  was  an  underlying  concept  of  how
this  investment  would  lead  to  applications  relying  on  an  entrepreneurial  dynamic.
This  effort  became  the  gestation  of  a  concerted  effort  that  culminated  in  the
ARPANET, as well as a number of technological innovations in the underlying com-
puter  graphics,  computer  processing,  and  other  capabilities  that  led  to  DARPA’s
fundamental  impact  on  ‘‘making  computers  personal’’.

state vision which had fundamental impact in fostering a transformational
concept and the creation of an entire industry.
DARPA’s Role in Creating a Revolution in Military Affairs12

.

DARPA  has  been  instrumental  in  developing  a  number  of  technologies,  systems
and  concepts  critical  to  what  some  have  termed  the  Revolution  in  Military  Af-
fairs (RMA) that DOD implemented in the 1990s based on R&D DARPA conducted
over the prior fifteen years. It did so by serving as a virtual DOD corporate labora-
tory:  a  central  research  activity,  reporting  to  the  top  of  the  organization,  with  the
flexibility  to  move  rapidly  into  new  areas  and  explore  opportunities  that  held  the
potential of ‘‘changing the business.’’ It was a virtual laboratory because DARPA did
not perform research directly but rather acted as a catalyst for innovation by articu-
lating thrust areas linked to overall DOD strategic needs, seeding and coordinating
external research communities, and funding large-scale demonstrations of disruptive
concepts.  In  doing  so,  the  DARPA  programs  presented  senior  DOD  leadership  with
opportunities  to  develop  disruptive  capabilities.  When  these  programs  received  con-
sistent  senior  leadership  support,  typically  from  the  highest  levels  of  the  Office  of
the  Secretary  of  Defense,  they  transitioned  into  acquisition  and  deployment.  At
other  times,  without  this  backing  from  highest  reaches  of  the  department,  only  the
less disruptive, less joint elements moved forward.

An example of one of the most successful DARPA programs is its championing of
stealth.  While  a  radical  and  controversial  concept,  DARPA’s  stealth  R&D  had  most
of the properties listed above. DARPA harnessed industry ideas. Low-observable air-
craft  had  been  built  before,  for  reconnaissance  and  intelligence  purposes,  but  not
pursued for combat applications. The Air Force had little interest in a slow, not very
maneuverable  plane  that  could  only  fly  at  night.  After  considerable  engineering
work,  the  HAVE  BLUE  proof-of-concept  system  enabled  top  OSD  and  Service  lead-
ership  to  proceed  with  confidence  to  fund  and  support  a  full-scale  acquisition  pro-
gram.  OSD  leadership  kept  the  subsequent  F–117A  program  focused  on  a  limited
set of high priority missions that existing aircraft could not perform well—e.g., over-
coming  Soviet  integrated  air  defenses—and  worked  with  Congress  to  protect  its
budget,  with  a  target  completion  date  within  the  same  administration.  The  result
was  a  ‘‘secret  weapon’’  capability—exactly  what  DARPA  and  top  DOD  leadership
had envisioned.
VISION: DARPA conception, development and demonstration of disruptive

capabilities

DARPA’s higher-risk, longer-term R&D agenda distinguishes it from other sources
of defense R&D funding. Perhaps the most important effect of DARPA’s work
is to change people’s minds as to what is possible.  A  fundamental  tension  for
DARPA is balancing its pursuit of high-risk research independent of a defined need
with  its  demonstration  of  capabilities  that  address  a  specific  strategic  problem  (but
not  defined  requirements).  Although  integration  projects  may  be  just  as  ‘‘high  risk’’
as  research  projects,  philosophically,  culturally,  and  managerially,  these  are  very
different  processes.  The  DARPA  Director  needs  to  mediate  between  these  missions
and,  more  importantly,  bridge  the  two  communities.  DARPA  has  been  effective  in
part because a strong axis between DARPA and top OSD leadership formed around
ambitious  outcomes,  not  technologies  per  se.  An  outcome  orientation  is  particularly
important in explaining to Congress what DARPA is doing and why.
LEADERSHIP: Acquisition and Deployment of Disruptive Capabilities

DARPA’s  history  shows  that  if  fielded  disruptive  capabilities  are  the  objective,  it
is  insufficient  for  DARPA  to  create  an  example  and  then  rely  upon  the  traditional
Service acquisition system to recognize its worth and implement it. Because acquisi-
tion  and  deployment  of  disruptive  capabilities  challenge  existing  programs  and  bu-
reaucracies,  it  is  difficult  to  find  eager  Service  customers  for  them.  Also,  because
new capabilities are not technically mature or operationally robust, the Services will
generally be reluctant to take on the significant and potentially costly risk reduction

efforts required to move them into acquisition. Hence, rapid acquisition and deploy-
ment  of  disruptive  capabilities  requires  an  integrated  and  consistent  senior  leader-
ship  effort,  typically  from  the  Director  of  Defense  Research  and  Engineering  or  the
Under Secretary of Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. These senior OSD leaders
must judiciously exercise their authority to overcome the resistance of people to new
ideas, of acquisition organizations to perceived competition, and of requirements and
acquisition organizations to uncertainty and risk.
Energy and the Environment—A DARPA Model?

DARPA’s  successes  in  spurring  technological  innovation  have  led  to  numerous
calls  for  applying  ‘‘the  DARPA  model’’  to  other  issues  than  national  defense.  As
noted  above,  one  area  that  has  received  particular  attention  is  energy  technology.
Does  the  DARPA  model  provide  a  useful  approach  to  address  issues  of  energy  re-
search  and  development?  The  foremost  question  is  what  is  the  imperative  for  rad-
ical, transformative R&D in energy technology equivalent to DARPA’s national secu-
rity concern? Are energy security and stemming climate change and its effects com-
parable motifs?

DARPA  is  chartered  to  identify  and  pursue  potential  technological  capabilities
that  could  provide  fundamental  advantage  to  the  U.S.  relative  to  existing  or  poten-
tial adversaries. The need to be ahead of all others to ‘‘avoid technological surprise’’
in the interest of national security is a recognized imperative for making exploratory
high-risk  investments.  Do  such  interests  as  ‘‘energy  independence’’  or  ameliorating
climate change provide sufficient imperatives for energy-related advanced research?
DARPA  has  had  the  imprimatur  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  to  both  engage  in
highly  uncertain  R&D  not  explicitly  focused  on  identified  requirements  and  to  pro-
mote  the  application  of  emergent,  often  disruptive  capabilities  based  on  such  re-
search. In essence the Secretary of Defense has played the role of the Chief Execu-
tive Officer protecting and supporting the Director of DARPA as the director of inno-
vation—seeking  new  technological  capabilities  that  can  redirect  and  revitalize  an
enterprise. While the Department of Energy has pursued advanced S&T in its Office
of Science, DOE has not had the type of implementation-focused efforts of advanced
technology  that  have  been  promoted  by  DOD  leadership  in  bringing  DARPA  devel-
opments  into  fruition.  While  DOE  clearly  has  an  important,  perhaps  dominant  role
in current energy research, and this research has repercussions for climate change,
the  two  are  not  synonymous.  For  example,  most  of  the  current  energy  research
agenda is driven by energy efficiency and security concerns focusing on incremental
improvements  of  existing  approaches.  Also,  the  scope  of  climate  change  R&D  goes
well beyond the scope of DOE.

Thus,  the  organizational  question  for  ‘‘ARPA–E’’  is  much  more  problematic  than
that  faced  by  DARPA.  DARPA’s  job  explicitly  is  national  security—and  the  main
government  focus  has  been  the  Department  of  Defense.  DARPA  has  been  stretched
into  broader  venues  including  support  for  the  intelligence  community  and  also  the
support  of  more  generic  commercially-related  programs—at  one  time  labeled  ‘‘dual
use’’ technologies. The intelligence-related aspects of DARPA, while at times collabo-
rated  and  coordinated  with  non-DOD  interests,  particularly  the  CIA,  are  clearly
linked to the national security mission and the fact that DOD operates its own vast
intelligence operations.

This  raises  another  vexing  question:  How  would  results  of  an  Energy  ARPA  be
brought into fruition? DARPA has developed an established network of implementa-
tion paths that varied by technology and application. It has developed strategies for
interacting with military users and developers for bringing military capabilities into
application using the support of OSD when needed. It has developed various mecha-
nisms  for  supporting  incipient  technological  capabilities  in  universities  and  small
enterprises and provided systematic support that builds an interlinked set of under-
pinning  technologies  that  together,  iteratively  have  moved  closer  to  an  ultimate
transformational  vision.  Can  an  Energy  ARPA  obtain  the  freedom  of  movement  to
organize  such  implementation  focused  investment  strategies?  Who  would  be  the  or-
ganizations  that  would  take  the  results  of  ARPA–E’s  proof-of-concept  research  and
move it into the next level of development? In creating an ARPA–E how clearly de-
fined  should  be  the  mechanisms  it  would  draw  upon  to  move  its  ideas  forward?  It
would  be  an  unfair  reading  of  history  to  say  that  all  of  this  was  well  understood
when  ARPA  was  founded.  For  the  military  side  of  the  equation  the  role  of  the  Sec-
retary  of  Defense  and  the  DDR&E  cannot  be  overstated.  Particularly  in  the  1960s

46

through the 1980s OSD interacted closely with the Director of DARPA in laying out
priorities  and  directions—while  the  Director  was  clearly  responsible  for  research.13
The  path  undertaken  by  DARPA  in  bringing  its  technical  results  into  application
has  been  that  of  a  somewhat  distant  or  indirect  supporter  of  the  implementation
process. In essence DARPA’s role in technology transition has been to support tech-
nology demonstrations often in conjunction with potential users or through a series
of ‘‘boot strapped’’ implementations of new technologies by employing the technology
development as inputs to other DARPA research. This latter approach has been par-
ticularly  effective  in  the  area  of  information  processing  technologies,  where  for  ex-
ample,  the  DARPA-supported  computer  workstations  were  specifically  acquired  for
use by DARPA-funded integrated circuit technology development programs.14 When
the results of the technology development most likely would have to be adopted and
adapted  by  the  commercial  sector  the  DARPA  approach  has  generally  been  one  of
encouragement,  but  not  direct  involvement.  The  concern  that  commercialization  is
a  function  that  is  best  left  to  others  than  those  in  government  has  led  to  proposals
for  creating  alternative,  non-governmental  mechanisms,  such  as  an  Energy  Tech-
nology Corporation, as suggested by John Deutch.15

In  employing  a  DARPA-model  to  another  area  of  research,  it  is  important  to  un-
derstand  that  DARPA  began  as  relatively  small,  highly  focused  organization  that
was  explicitly  taking  on  problems  that  were  of  relatively  little  priority  to  existing
military  R&D  organizations.  Yet,  the  issues  were  of  great  importance  and  priority
to  senior  leadership—including  the  Secretary  of  Defense  and  the  President.  Later,
as the policy and technological circumstances changed, DARPA morphed and adapt-
ed.  In  particular,  DARPA  has  been  focused  on  pursuing  advanced  technology
projects  that  could  potentially  ‘‘make  a  difference’’—and  wedded  not  to  the  success
of  any  particular  project.  It  has  been  an  ‘‘innovation  farm’’  and  idea  incubator.  It
has  only  exceptionally  taken  on  the  actual  implementation  of  a  technology—and
then  only  as  a  last  resort,  or  as  a  very  incipient  step  in  application  prototyping.  If
another department were to stand up an ‘‘ARPA-like’’ organization, it should not try
to invent a full-blown, full scale operation based on DARPA after 30 years. Rather,
it  should  endeavor  to  build  the  organization  organically,  adaptively  focusing  on  ex-
plicit  high  priority  mission  challenges.  The  idea  should  not  be  to  make  something
look  like  DARPA;  it  should  be  to  identify  and  organize  advanced  research  around
imperatives that are similar in nature to those that have driven DARPA.

DARPA  has  been  able  to  take  on  high-level  issues  that  are  disruptive  of  current
operations and technical interests. The example of stealth, above, shows how it fos-
tered  a  concept  that  was  received  hostilely  by  the  main  service  that  was  to  employ
it—the  Air  Force—and  initially  rejected  by  the  Navy.  Even  in  its  information  tech-
nology  research  DARPA  confronted  a  major,  well-ensconced  vested  interest  in  IBM,
who  at  the  time  totally  dominated  not  only  the  computer  industry,  but  also  com-
puter  research.16 Can  a  civilian  organization  maintain  independence  of  its  tech-
nology  program  from  such  powerful  ‘‘vested  interests’’?  DARPA  had  certain  advan-
tages  that  may  be  difficult  to  emulate  in  a  non-DOD  organization,  particularly
today. First, at its inception it had the cover of the initial set of Presidential Issues,
vested  on  it  directly  from  the  Secretary  of  Defense.  It  was  given  a  charter  to  take
on  issues  that  the  existing  Service  R&D  structure  had  failed  to  give  adequate  pri-
ority  to  and  the  results  of  which  were  manifestly  wanting.  As  it  successfully  ad-
dressed its initial set of programs it further gained the support of OSD which gave
it  the  top  cover  it  needed.  If  an  Energy  ARPA  is  to  have  any  chance  of  success  it
will  need  this  level  of  support  from  both  the  Secretary  of  Energy  and  the  White
House.

13 The  interaction  between  the  DARPA  director  and  OSD  is  important  here.  This  was  not  a
one-way  street  with  OSD  handing  down  specific  focus  for  research,  rather  it  was  a  dialogue  in
which  the  OSD,  usually  through  the  DDR&E,  today  the  USD  (AT&L),  would  lay  out  military
and technical challenges it saw as priorities and DARPA would develop its perspective on what
emerging technical capabilities might address these. DARPA, often in conjunction with other or-
ganizations,  such  as  the  Defense  Nuclear  Agency  (DNA),  would  conduct  studies  and  provide
input to high-level DOD leadership on options for addressing daunting strategic concerns.

Issues in Establishing an ARPA–E

Some  key  elements  that  would  need  to  be  addressed,  and  in  some  cases  directly

overcome, if an effective ARPA–E were to be created, are:

1. Leadership  support—As  discussed  above,  ARPA  had  President  Eisenhower’s
direct  and  strong  support,  and  this  support  has  generally  been  sustained
with both the White House and the Secretary of Defense.

2. Congressional  oversight—One  issue  for  ARPA–E,  relative  to  DARPA  is  that
DARPA  enjoys  Congressional  oversight  that  is  relatively  simple,  and  has
generally had the backing of key members and staffers.

3. Existing Lab structure—ARPA–E will need to contend with a research infra-
structure  in  the  National  Laboratories,  that  had  no  such  precedent  in  DOD.
The Service R&D structure lacked the scale and scope of the current ‘‘energy
labs’’ and also the support on Capitol Hill that these labs have.

4. Incumbent business interests—DARPA has succeeded by developing and fos-
tering a community of interest ranging from academics to business. It devel-
oped these communities piece by piece from the ground up, based on techno-
logical  capabilities  and  prospects.  It  has  been  able  to  find  within  that  com-
munity  interested  and  innovative  participants  who  were  willing  to  experi-
ment  with  new  ideas.  In  its  information  processing  technology  development,
DARPA was able to build an alternative base despite the dominant presence
of  IBM.  It  is  unclear  whether  the  firms  currently  in  energy  production  and
usage  will  be  open  to  such  experimentation  and  whether  alternative  firms
and even alternative sectors can grow within the energy industrial structure.
An Energy ARPA has been proposed as a way to respond to critical energy needs
by  accelerating  research  in  game-changing  technologies.  Advocates  of  this  new  ap-
proach  need  to  make  a  strong  case  on  what  it  is  they  see  as  needing  to  be  done
that  the  current  R&D  processes  are  not  doing  successfully.  In  essence,  they  need
the moral equivalent of their Sputnik to galvanize support for such a novel agency.
Is the lack of a robust hybrid automobile program in the U.S. an example that has
similar sway? Is the hydrogen energy effort in this country similar to the ineffective
Service response to Soviet ICBMs in the 1950s to provide a stimulus to creating an
Energy  ARPA?  Is  the  recognition  of  the  anthropogenic  climate  change  impacts
reaching  a  point  where  high-level  policy-makers  have  come  to  realize  that  incre-
mental approaches based on existing technologies is so insufficient that a radical en-
terprise is needed?

DISCUSSION

Chairwoman  GIFFORDS.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Van  Atta.  We  are  on  a
bit of a time crunch, in terms of Mr. Inglis’ schedule, so I am going
to allow him to start this first round of questions.

NUCLEAR RESEARCH

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Madam Chair. Very kind of you to let me

go here, and appreciate the testimony.

Mr.  Denniston,  you  said  something  interesting,  that  nuclear
shouldn’t  be  included.  Things  that  I  have  heard  lately  about  nu-
clear.  It  has  been  a  long  time,  of  course,  since  we  built  a  nuclear
power  plant,  and  I  heard  a  major  construction  company  tell  me
they’re not sure that we have the capacity, that if you look around
at  who  could  design  them,  and  that  sort  of  thing,  they  were  ex-
pressing some doubt.

In  talking  to  electrical  generator  kind  of  companies,  people  who
make  electricity,  they  tell  me  they  are  not  willing  to  spend  money
on research in next generation reactors. If that is the case, we have
lost some proficiencies in construction, and we don’t have the appe-
tite  for  research  in  the  private  sector,  why  not  include  nuclear  in
ARPA–E?

Mr.  DENNISTON.  Great  question.  My  answer  would  be  that  I  am
not saying that we shouldn’t fund nuclear research. What I am say-
ing is that the narrow purpose and mission, in my view, of ARPA–
E,  is  translational  research.  Translational  research  is  focused  on
identifying  in  the  world,  in  the  case  of  energy,  in  the  commercial-
industrial  business  world,  the  breakthrough  energy  solutions  that
will  solve  climate  change,  energy  dependence,  American  competi-
tiveness,  and  then  reaching  back  to  basic  science,  and  identifying
the  possible  solutions,  and  pushing  them  forward  to  the  bring  of
commercialization,  which  is  where  industry  can  take  over.  And  so,
DOE  can  and  will  fund  nuclear  research.  You  can  separately  dis-
cuss what the appropriate funding levels would be.

To  the  comments  that  have  been  made  by  the  panel,  the  impor-
tance  of  having  a  focused  mission,  and  of  having  a  consistent  cul-
ture,  and  a  small,  flat,  risk-taking  organization,  are  critical  to  the
importance of ARPA–E, as those factors were to DARPA.

And  for  those  reasons,  and  what  I  also  said  in  my  testimony,
Congressman, is that translational research is best suited to identi-
fying  breakthrough  technologies  in  emerging  fields,  and  not  really
design for incremental improvements in existing ones.

TECHNOLOGY COMMERCIALIZATION

Mr.  INGLIS.  Let  me  ask,  you  are  here  in  the  Science  and  Tech-
nology Committee, and of course, that means that we want to pro-
vide these breakthroughs, or be involved in the breakthroughs, and
help,  as  we  push  through  the  barriers.  And  maybe  at  Energy  and
Commerce, they regulate things that already are in existence.

But there is sort of a chicken and egg question here, I think, and
that  is  whether  there  is  technology  already  available,  and  what  it
takes  is  market  forces  to  force  them  into  a  position  of  being  viable
in  a  commercial  marketplace.  And  to  some  extent,  you  know,  it  is,
we don’t want to do science projects. We actually want to—they are
fun  and  very  valuable,  but  we  want  to  actually  get  the  technology
into  the  marketplace,  right?  So,  anybody  want  to  take  a  shot  at
whether  that  is  what  we  are  successfully  doing  here,  or  whether
really  what  we  should  be  talking  about  is  some  kind  of  dealing  in
the  marketplace,  in  terms  of  the  price  of  gasoline,  and  things  like
that, that make it so that technologies would suddenly become very
viable.

Dr.  FORREST.  I  would  like  to  make  a  comment  on  that,  if  I  may.
I  tend  to  agree  with  part  of  your  question,  which  is  do  we  know

the  scientific  and  technological  routes  to  make  clean  energy?  The
answer to that is by and large, we do. Is it affordable? No, it is not.
We are competing against fossil fuel. It is not an even playing field,
but  that  is  not  the  point.  We  are  dealt  the  playing  field  that  we
have.

So  the  real  question  is  what  are  the  science  and  technology
breakthroughs that will make these solutions affordable? And that
is  what  an  independent  ARPA–E  will  do,  because  it  tailors,  it
brings  the  innovative  engine  together  with  the  commercial  engine,
and  you  get  it  to  be  pulled  into  the  marketplace  very  rapidly.  So,
no,  we  are  not  at  all  advocating,  I  don’t  believe  anybody  on  this
panel  is  advocating  that  we  create  another  NSF.  That  is  really,
that  creates  the  fundamental  base  of  the  technologies  that  we  are
talking  about.  What  we  are  looking  at  is,  and  I  think  Mr.
Denniston  said  it  very  well,  it  is  this  partnership,  this  translation
that takes us from that basis to a market effective economy.

Mr.  INGLIS.  And  Dr.  Forrest,  actually,  you  sharpened  my  ques-
tion  very  well,  because  I  don’t  want  to  sound  like  I  am  opposed  to
basic  research.  We  here  on  this  committee,  we  are  very  excited
about  basic  research,  because  who  knows  where  it  will  lead,  but  it
gives  us  opportunities  to  pursue.  But  you  are  onto,  really,  the  bet-
ter,  more  precise  question.  That  is,  if  you  internalize  the  external
cost of those fossil fuels, and made it so the market properly evalu-
ated those, then the question is whether some of those technologies
might suddenly become viable.

Dr. FORREST. Well, I certainly would.
Mr.  BONVILLIAN.  Mr.  Inglis,  you  have  asked  a  very  important
question.  I  think  the  underlying  issue  here  is  that  there  is  a  vari-
ety  of  things  we  are  going  to  have  to  do  in  this  very  complex  area
of trying to stand up technologies within deeply established sectors.
And part of that is going to have to be looking at the whole pricing
situation, and someday, we will do that.

Within that, though, we have to get the innovation system right,
too.  If  we  don’t  have  the  innovation  system  serving  up  new  oppor-
tunities, if we only deal with the macro-pricing system, we are still
going to be completely behind the eight-ball. If we don’t have inno-
vation  opportunities  that  the  energy  sectors  that  are  going  to
adopt, and see as ways out of their dilemma, we are just not going
to get there.

So, I think the function of this committee is a crucial one in this
mix, which is to get the innovation system in the kind of shape we
are  going  to  need  to  allow  these  technology  opportunities  to  hap-
pen.  There  is  a  series  of  problems,  as  I  see  it,  in  the  technology
standup  area.  The  first  set  of  problems,  and  to  some  extent  we
have emphasized this, is standing up sort of disruptive technologies
that are going to be in new areas, and not necessarily compete with
established sectors. And there are many of these. And DARPA has
done  that  brilliantly.  I  mean,  it  has  sold  into  the  Defense  Depart-
ment,  but  it  has  also  launched  many  technologies  into  the  private
sector, using its model.

But then, in the energy sector, we have got other problems. A lot
of  what  we  stand  up  are  going  to  have  to  be  components  in  estab-
lished  sectors.  So,  you  think  of  a  battery  in  a  hybrid  engine.  That
is  going  to  be  a  component  in  a  larger  automotive  system.  You

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 18:32 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 034719 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\042607\34719 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

50

think  of  carbon  capture  and  sequestration.  Those  are  components
in  a  much  larger  utility  sector.  Some  of  those  sectors  are  going  to
be  game  for  adapting  new  technologies.  Some  aren’t.  Some  are
going to resist this change, and resist it in very tough-minded, com-
petitive ways.

So,  we  are  going  to  have  to  figure  out  how  to  weave  through
those areas. I think a translational research entity can play a role,
particularly in those sectors where adaptation is going to be accept-
ed. But we need to have technologies for the full range.

There are two other fundamental technology problems here. One
is in the conservation and efficiency side. Some of that will involve
breakthrough  opportunities,  and  some  of  it  is  very  incremental,
probably  not  a  role  for  an  ARPA–E.  And  second,  there  is  a  deep
manufacturing process side, that gets to your point about cost.

One thing that DARPA has done an interesting job on, occasion-
ally, over the years is looking at how to drive down manufacturing
costs  for  defense  products.  It  is  a  very  sophisticated  technology
problem; it is a very sophisticated R&D problem. A lot of DARPA’s
work  in  bringing  IT  into  the  manufacturing  process  has  had  huge
payoffs for other sectors as well. In order for a lot of the new tech-
nologies that we are going to need to compete, there is a manufac-
turing  process  task  that  we  are  going  to  have  to  go  after,  and  this
might  be  an  interesting  task,  at  least  for  breakthrough  parts  of
that, for an ARPA–E as well.

So, I think there is a series of roles—as we begin to break down
the  jobs  that  we  need  to  get  done  in  this  complex  sector—I  think
there is a series of roles an ARPA–E could play.

Mr.  DENNISTON.  Congressman,  could  I  try  and  answer?  Your
question  was  is  it  sensible  public  policy  to  put  a  price  on  carbon,
and  I  am  going  to  give  you  an  answer  in  one  simple  declarative
sentence. Emphatically, yes.

I  believe  that  is  the  single  most  important  thing  that  Congress
can  do.  Research  is  really  important.  We  have  got  to  do  that,  but
we  have  a  free  externality  now  that  needs  to  be  changed.  I  think
I  gave  you  two  sentences.  If  I  could  add  one  more  comment,  going
back to your prior question on nuclear.

If  you  look  back  over  50  years,  and  you  add  up  the  federal  re-
search  funding  of  nuclear  plus  renewables,  it  is  a  large  sum.  Of
that sum, nuclear has received 96 percent of the total. So, I believe
it  is  time  to  level  the  playing  field,  and  give  some  of  these  renew-
ables a shot at the market.

Dr.  VAN ATTA.  If  I  can,  just  one  quick  point.  You  can  talk  about
the market forces, technologies available, these market forces. That
was true in 1958, ’59, ’60, in computers. There was a market force,
and  it  was  called  IBM.  It  controlled  the  technology.  It  controlled
the marketplace, in much the same way as the large energy compa-
nies,  the  large  power  producers,  et  cetera,  do  in  the  energy  field
today,  perhaps  not  quite  to  the  same  extent,  but  largely,  in  terms
of controlling what is out there.

DARPA  created  the  alternative  capabilities  and  technology  that
allowed  others  to  enter  into  the  marketplace,  and  also  provided
some mechanisms by which those technologies actually got out into
the  field.  Through  various  internal  procurement  aspects,  the  gov-
ernment is a major consumer of energy. The government sets regu-

51

lations  on  energy.  The  government  procures  energy  systems.  If
those  new  ideas  are  coming  forward,  and  have  major  impact,  but
perhaps  need  to  be  buffered  over  time,  in  terms  of  cost  and  risk,
the government can play some very successful roles in spurring the
adaptation of those technologies and implementation.

And I think there are some lessons learned as to how DARPA did
that in certain areas, and I think there are some other public policy
examples we have that can be useful in that as well.

HOMELAND SECURITY ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS

AGENCY (HSARPA)

Chairwoman  GIFFORDS.  Thank  you.  This  question  is  mostly  di-
rected  to  Mr.  Bonvillian  and  also  Dr.  Van  Atta,  but  certainly,  feel
free to comment if you have some thoughts on this.

Mr.  Bonvillian,  you  were  instrumental  in  developing  the  Home-
land Security ARPA model, and looking at your written testimony,
the  program  has  not  been,  by  and  large,  very  successful.  So,  I  am
curious  what  we  can  learn  in  terms  of  not  having  successes  there
in  Homeland  Security.  What  sort  of  lessons  can  be  learned,  and
how are we going to possibly avoid these problems with the ARPA–
E model?

Mr.  BONVILLIAN.  You  know,  this  committee,  the  Science  Com-
mittee,  played  a  very  central  role  in  trying  to  tackle  the  whole
science  and  technology  mission  of  Homeland  Security,  including
standing  up  an  HSARPA  model.  So,  when  I  was  working  on  the
Hill,  I  worked  very,  very  closely  with  this  committee’s  staff.  They
were equally involved.

The  Committee  provided  HSARPA,  I  thought  and  still  believe,  a
strong  and  flexible  authorization  that  was  modeled  on  DARPA’s
strengths.  But  HSARPA  was  never  adequately  utilized  or  imple-
mented,  and  it  really  exists  now  as  a  shell  within  a  much  larger
organization,  with  a  very  minimal  budget.  And  while  a  very  tal-
ented initial staff, including a number of very talented people from
DARPA itself, were hired to organize the entity, it was a significant
period of time, over a year, before HSARPA obtained a leader. Un-
fortunately, because of illness, he was not able to stay in that enti-
ty for a lengthy period of time.

So,  there  was  an  initial  leadership  gap  problem.  I  think  there  is
a series of lessons here that we can learn. First, an innovation cul-
ture is critical to success. I think the HSARPA entity had the team
to be able to do that innovation initially, but the culture of the en-
tity—the  overall  DHS  Science  and  Technology  Directorate—that  it
got  stood  up  in  was  not  prepared  to  accept  this.  It  was,  in  effect,
being rejected as a foreign body.

So,  having  support  from  the  agencies  and/or  overall  entity  in
which this ARPA–E will be stood up becomes crucial. Relationships
with  the  Department  of  Energy,  if  it  is  stood  up  at  DOE,  become
absolutely  vital.  This  has  got  to  be  something  DOE  wants  to  do.
Otherwise, it is just not going to work. And that became a problem,
even though the whole S&T Directorate was also new, that became
a problem within Homeland Security.

ARPA–E  is  going  to  need  its  own  budget,  and  the  ability  to  con-
trol it. HSARPA did not have that power; its budget was controlled
from  above.  It  never  had  the  authority  to  even  make  R&D  deci-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 18:32 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 034719 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\042607\34719 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

52

sions.  All  of  those  had  to  go  through  a  constant  approval  process.
So,  it  was  never  allowed  the  autonomy  that  we  have  talked  about
as a necessity. It never had an island to be creative. So, that needs
to be ensured, and control over its own budget is an absolute neces-
sity,  and  it  has  got  to  be  a  sizable  enough  budget  to  make  a  dif-
ference.

Technical talent of great skill is vital here, but you also need peo-
ple  with  experience  in  the  federal  R&D  system  that  are  going  to
know  how  to  relate  to  the  other  bureaucracies,  who  are  going  to
know people there, know how they are organized, know what their
cultures  are,  to  be  able  to  make  those  connections  work.  I  think
that is another lesson to draw from this HSARPA experience.

And finally, you need to decide on the fundamental mission. One
of  the  issues  within  the  DHS  Science  and  Technology  Directorate
was  that  there  was  a  lot  of  short-term  technology  available  that
needed to be stood up quickly, given the threat to the country. And
HSARPA  can  play  a  role  in  that,  of  course,  but  its  fundamental
mission  is  much  more  on  the  breakthrough  side,  the  left-right
model that we talked about earlier.

If you try to mix the two missions together, short and long range
R&D, you run into difficulties. And the shorter-term mission, which
is  frankly  a  more  expensive  mission  often,  because  you  are  stand-
ing  up  technologies,  tends  to  become  a  bill-payer  for  the  longer-
term  mission,  because  the  deadlines  are  not  as  real.  So,  HSARPA
got raided, in a way, to stand up a lot of the shorter-term problems.
So,  decide  early  on  what  the  mission  is,  and  don’t  try  to  mix  it,  if
you try to stand up an ARPA–E.

Chairwoman GIFFORDS. Thank you. Dr. Van Atta.
Dr.  VAN ATTA.  Well,  I  agree  that  Bill  has  pretty  much  put  his
finger  on  it.  First  of  all,  the  imperative  of  the  near-term  over-
whelmed  the  ideas  of  HSARPA,  the  long-term,  after  9/11,  get
things  out  there,  do  things  quickly.  Whatever  we  had,  go  find  it,
so  it  was  very,  very  short-term,  almost  commercial,  off  the  shelf,
paint it a different color and get it out there.

That  swept  away  any  of  the  longer-term  notions,  and  put  them
on  the  back  burner,  constantly  kept  moving  them  back.  The  lack
of  budget,  the  lack  of  autonomy,  the  lack  of  independence,  all  the
things  we  talked  about  that  made  DARPA  DARPA  weren’t  part  of
HSARPA.  So,  I  think  we  can  learn  pretty  much  that  if  you  don’t
do it right, you are going to get it wrong.

Chairwoman  GIFFORDS.  Thank  you.  Let  me  turn  to  Ms.  Biggert.

ARPA–E REPORTING STRUCTURE

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman.
Thank  you  all  for  being  here.  I  know  that  I  have  discussed  this
issue,  and  I  don’t  know  if  any  of  you  were  at  any  of  the  hearings
that  we  had  last  year,  where  we  picked  this  up,  but  one  of  the
things I would like to know is if you have all read the recommenda-
tions  on  ARPA–E  included  in  the  National  Academies’  Gathering
Storm report. And I would like everybody to say yes or no, and ev-
erybody is waving yes.

ARPA–E,  or  do  you  believe  it  leaves  a  lot  of  questions  unan-

swered? We will start. Just—Mr. Bonvillian.

Mr.  BONVILLIAN.  Congresswoman,  they  did  not  provide  a  lot  of
detail in the Gathering Storm report. They did not lay out a frame-
work.  They  laid  out  an  idea.  They  laid  out  a  concept.  They  identi-
fied what they felt was an institutional gap in the array of institu-
tions that we have at DOE. And I don’t want to be critical of DOE
here.  I  mean,  there  are  great  things  going  on  in  the  Office  of
Science. There are great things going on in our federal laboratories.
The  point  I  would  make,  though,  is  that  this  particular
translational  role  has  not  been  tasked  to  DOE,  and  the  institu-
tional array to tackle it just hasn’t been set up at this time.

Ms. BIGGERT. Okay.
Mr. BONVILLIAN. And then, the question becomes whether or not
you  can  use  existing  institutions  at  DOE  to  do  this,  and  I  would
argue  no,  you  probably  want  to  create  this  thing,  if  that  is  a  role
that you want to make.

Ms. BIGGERT. Okay, Mr. Denniston.
Mr.  DENNISTON.  No.  I  don’t  think  that  the  Gathering  Storm  re-
port provided implementation details. I view it as an idea. So, they
don’t  talk  specifically  about  which  technologies,  fossil,  nuclear,  re-
newable.  They  don’t  talk  about  stage  of  research,  should  it  be
translational, is it basic, is it applied? They don’t talk about the or-
ganizational details, much of which you have heard today.

They  do  talk  about  funding  levels,  which  are  exactly  what  you
have  in  the  draft  ARPA–E,  but  they  don’t  explain  where  those
numbers came from, and so, I think there is a lot—while the funda-
mental  idea  is  sound,  an  awful  lot  of  the  implementation  details
are absent, and should be addressed in ARPA–E.

Ms. BIGGERT. Dr. Forrest.
Dr.  FORREST.  I  agree  with  the  previous  two  speakers,  in  that  it
is more of a schematic diagram of what this agency would look like.
One  of  the  things  that  it  does  comment  on,  though,  is  that  the
agency  should  report  to  the  Under  Secretary  of  Science,  and  I  do
not  believe  that  that  is  the  best  location  for  this  reporting  struc-
ture. It should go directly to the Secretary of Energy.

The  other  thing,  I  do  believe  that  although  it  is  schematic  to  be
discussing specific funding levels, probably which are rapidly being
swept  aside  by  current  events  and  so  on,  is  probably  something
that  the  Committee  and  the  Congress  should  discuss  as  a  whole,
but I would look at those recommendations as a starting point, but
not an ending point for what we need to do here.

Ms. BIGGERT. Dr. Van Atta.
Dr.  VAN ATTA.  Yeah,  I  pretty  much  agree,  that  what  they  pre-
sented there was a generic approach, one looking for a fundamental
alternative.  Norm  Augustine  is  very  familiar  with  DARPA,  being
on the Defense Science Board, having worked, you know, as Chair-
man  of  Lockheed  Martin,  and  in  fact,  being  the  head  of  the  Army
Science  Technology,  back  when  he  worked  with  the  Office  of  Sec-
retary of Defense.

So,  he  knew  the  effectiveness  and  the  impact  that  had  for  secu-
rity  and  defense,  and  so,  I  think  they  were  looking  at  this  as  a
model,  but  not  to  be  explicitly,  they  didn’t  have  the  explicit  imple-
mentation details.

ARPA–E STUDY

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Okay.  Thank  you.  In  a  bill  that  we  passed  at  the
end  of  last  year,  H.R.  6203,  we  had  a  suggestion  for  a  study,  an
ARPA–E  study  that  would  be  conducted  by—well,  the  Secretary  of
Department  of  Energy  would  enter  into  an  arrangement  with  the
National  Academies  of  Sciences  to  conduct  a  detailed  study,  and
make  further  recommendations,  and  obviously,  it  is  too  late  for
that  now,  as  far  as  that  bill,  because  it  passed  the  House,  but  not
the Senate.

But do you think—I am concerned about setting up a completely
different  agency  before  we  have  answered  a  lot  of  these  questions
that  were  put  forward.  As  you  just  mentioned,  there  were  unan-
swered  questions  before  we  set  up  a  completely  new  agency,  and
there are about five questions. You know, to determine what every-
body  does  now,  so  to  know  what  would  be  the  focus  of  the  new
agency, and how, to the extent that DARPA would be used as the,
whether it should be used as, whether it is the appropriate model,
how  research  and  development  sponsored  by  ARPA  would  differ
from  that  that  is  done  by  the  National  Labs,  or  sponsored  by  the
Office  of  Science,  or  Office  of  Energy  Efficiency,  and  should  indus-
try  or  National  Laboratories  be  recipients  of  the  ARPA–E  grants,
which I think are all questions that really need to be answered be-
fore this happens.

Dr. FORREST. I would like to answer a couple of those questions.
In  my  formal  remarks,  where  I  did  mention  that  the  flexibility  of
DARPA came from the fact that it really does not provide substan-
tial funding to the DOD labs, which is the equivalent.

The  National  Labs  simply  are  not  organized  to  be  a  functional
change agent within our country. I think a lot of the questions that
you asked are very important, but I do think we know many of the
answers.  I  think  we  do  know  what  the  goal  of  the  Labs  are.  We
do  know,  for  example,  what  the  basic  mission  of  the  basic  energy
sciences,  for  example,  is  funding.  And  I  do  believe  that  given  the
scale of the problem, there is a huge, unmet need in the center, and
that  is  this  translation  between  idea  and  moving  to  market.  And
this  is  what  has  not  been  served  traditionally,  we  know  this  quite
well, by the Department of Energy, and we really have to move on
from that point, because of the national strategic need for this, and
also, for the environmental challenge that we are facing.

Ms. BIGGERT. I don’t think that is all, you know, all of the ques-
tion,  because  it  is,  you  know,  it  can  be  private,  whatever.  Let  me
just  say  that,  a  couple  of  things  I  hear.  I  think  that  most  of  you
seem,  I  think,  it  makes  it  sound  like  the  National  Labs  don’t  do
anything, and to me, it was always their focus, was to be the inno-
vation,  to  do  the  basic  research  that  is  going  to  lead  them  to  the
transitional, to lead to the marketplace. And I think the difference
between DARPA and ARPA–E is that when DARPA develops some-
thing, it is developed, but it has the demand. I mean, they—it has
the  demand  for  it,  because  we  have  the  military,  which  is  then
going to receive the product that is developed.

What happens in the sciences is we don’t know what the demand
will  be,  and  you  are  talking  about  fossil  fuels.  If  they  are  not,  you
know,  while  we  are  using  those,  we  haven’t  been  able  to  convince

55

the—or  find  the  demand  that  is  going  to  do  away  with  those.  For
example,  let  us  take  a  hybrid  car.  Right  now,  we  are  seeing  the
higher  prices  of  gasoline,  so  people  are  going  out  and  buying  more
hybrid  cars,  which  is  really  good,  but  if  we  have  offered  an  incen-
tive to, because the price is higher, so what we have to do is to cre-
ate  the—everybody  is  going  to  want  to  buy  a  hybrid  car,  and  they
are not going to want to use just one that has gasoline in it.

With  the  military,  they  are  going  to  determine  that  this  is  the
product that is going to be used in lieu of something else that isn’t
as  good,  and  that  is  what  worries  me.  You  set  this  up,  and  say
okay,  we  are  going  to  find  the  innovation,  and  we  have  to,  to
complete——

Mr. DENNISTON. Can I——
Ms. BIGGERT. Yes, sir.
Mr. DENNISTON. Can I try a shot at that, Congresswoman? First
is  on  the  question  of  a  study.  I  wouldn’t  do  a  study.  I  think  this
subcommittee  has  the  facts  and  the  expertise  to  be  able  to  decide
those  details.  A  study  delays  implementation,  which  I  would  be
very much opposed to.

On  your  question,  on  the  distinction  that  you  draw  between
DARPA  and  ARPA–E,  my  belief  is  that  is  a  distinction  without  a
difference, and I think my view is that we are currently today see-
ing a Moore’s Law effect in the renewable energy field, where wind
power,  the  price  of  wind  power  has  declined  by  an  order  of  mag-
nitude in the past 20 years. Solar power, by 60 percent in the same
period  of  time.  Biofuels  are  twice  as  efficient  now  as  they  were  in
the ’80s, and that is before we put a lot of resources, private indus-
try  and  federal,  on  it.  I  can  assure  you  that  this  Moore’s  Law,  the
slope of the curve will accelerate.

And  the  objective  of  this  is  to  end  up  with  renewable  sources  of
energy  that  are  price-advantaged  over  the  incumbent  sources,  and
the  sooner  we  do  that,  the  sooner  that  we  will  relieve  ourselves  of
the  three  crises:  energy  dependence,  American  competitiveness,
and climate change.

I was in China over the summer, and I had lunch with the Gen-
eral  Director  of  their  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology,  on  the
subject  of  energy  research.  They  are  doing  an  enormous  amount.
He didn’t tell me the amount that they are funding, but pointed me
in  different  directions  around  the  country.  They  are  putting  a  lot
of  resource  on  this.  I  was  in  Europe  last  month,  visiting  with  gov-
ernmental officials. There is a race to lead the next industrial revo-
lution.  In  my  opinion,  it  will  be  around  energy,  and  if  America
doesn’t lead that race, then we will pay the consequences, in terms
of  standard  of  living,  jobs,  and  prosperity  in  this  country.  This  is
urgent, it is a crisis, we need to get going, in my view.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  I  think  we  would  all  agree  with  you,  but  I  would
add  to  that  that  we  have  to  really  focus  in  on  nuclear  energy  and
the  recycling  of  the  waste,  and  I  think  that  we  need  to  get  going
on  that,  and  I  worry  that  some  of  these  other  things  might  take,
you  know,  because  it  is  going  to  be  the  cost,  but  in  the  long-term,
it  is  going  to  lower,  you  know,  because  it  will  come  down  once  we
have developed enough of the reactors and enough of the recycling.
Dr. FORREST. If I could just, if I may, just wheel out one statistic.
Germany has been working very hard on solar. In about five years,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 18:32 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 034719 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\042607\34719 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

56

they  anticipate  that  more  energy  in  Germany  will  be  produced  by
solar  power  than  by  nuclear  power.  The  cost  curves  that  are  driv-
ing  solar  today  are  extraordinarily  aggressive,  and  if  we  stay  on
this  track—by  the  way,  there  are  some  very  large  American  sup-
pliers of that German solar energy, which is good news. But I think
that  there  are  numerous  things—there  is  no  silver  bullet  here  in
finding  a  single  energy  solution,  but  we  really  do  have  to  work  on
renewables,  because  that  is  where  the  future  of  this  technology  is
going.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Yeah.  And  I  think  what  you  are  saying  is  abso-
lutely  true,  but  I  don’t  know  if  there  is  just  one  silver  bullet,  like
ARPA–E,  that  is  going  to  create  that.  And  I  know  I  am  way  over
my  time,  Madam  Chairman.  If  I  might  just  go  back.  I  hope  Mr.
Denniston  does  not  think  it  would  be  worthwhile  for  NAS  to  an-
swer some of these unanswered questions, or come to some kind of
consensus  to,  you  know,  to  find  out  what  their  recommendations
are.

Mr.  Bonvillian—how  do  you—do  you  think  that  NAS  should  do

a study, or there should be any answers?

Mr. BONVILLIAN. Congresswoman, I think we know a tremendous
amount about the DARPA model, and we understand what that is.
And  I  think  that  there  is  a  fair  amount  of  understanding,  includ-
ing,  in  some  circles  at  DOE,  that  this  translational  role  is  not
there. It is not within the current DOE institutional array. It is not
anyone’s fault, there just happens to be a gap.

I  think  the  critical  decisions  is  are  we  going  to  fill  that  institu-
tional  gap,  and  are  we  going  to  allocate  the  resources  necessary  to
fill that gap? If you decide to fill the gap, there is a variety of solu-
tions, inside DOE, or outside DOE, as a component within or as an
entity  outside  some  existing  entity.  There  is  a  variety  of  solutions
there, but the real decision is are we going to fill that institutional
gap in some way, and then, are we going to put the resources into
this,  in  order  to  enable  it  to  operate  at  scale,  to  begin  to  stand  up
the  array,  or  the  portfolio,  of  technology  options  we  are  going  to
have  to  have  at.  I  think  those  are  probably  the  crucial  questions.

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you. Dr. Forrest.
Dr. FORREST. I think I have commented enough on that.
Ms. BIGGERT. All right. And Dr. Van Atta.
Dr.  VAN ATTA.  I  am  an  analyst  by  trade,  and  so,  doing  studies
is  always  a  wonderful  idea,  except  there  is  a  time  we  have  to  stop
doing  studies.  The  fact  of  the  matter  is,  is  there  is  a  well-defined
issue and need here, and a potential mechanism. I have raised the
questions  in  terms  of  the  issue  of  commercialization,  the  issue  of
the  role  of  the  Labs,  et  cetera.  All  of  these  things  are  things  that
management  direction  from  leadership  can  lay  out  in  terms  of
these are things that we need to be concerned about.

How  do  you  link  to  the  National  Labs,  whether  it  is  the  major
defense  labs,  or  whether  it  is  Argonne  or  Oak  Ridge?  They  have
great new technological capabilities there. How do those move from
there  into  demonstration  practices,  in  terms  of  proof-of-concept  for
application? An ARPA–E might be a mechanism where those ideas
can  be  moved  out  of  the  lab.  Because  one  of  the  problems  is  the
Labs  do  work  in  the  Labs.  The  question  of  how  to  get  things  out
of  the  Labs,  and  from  the  Labs  into  other  people’s  hands  is  some-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 18:32 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 034719 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\042607\34719 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

57

thing that we are all interested in finding better solutions for, and
ARPA–E could provide a mechanism for that.

In  terms  of  mechanisms,  in  terms  of  whether  it  should  be  nu-
clear,  et  cetera,  that  is  part  of  a  strategy.  That  strategy  has  to  be
set  at  the  national  level,  and  that  is  part  of  the  strategy  which  is
set  by  leadership.  The  roles  of  the  different  technological  capabili-
ties  towards  reaching  those  strategic  goals  have  to  be  evaluated.  I
don’t think a National Academy can make those determinations up
front  any  more  than  anyone  else  can.  That  has  to  be  part  of  an
overall strategic develop.

Professor  Sokoloff,  for  example,  has  presented  this  notion  of  the
wedges.  It  is  very  clear  that  not  any  single  one  of  these  techno-
logical  capabilities  is  going  to  solve  the  problem.  My  father  spent
his  entire  career  at  Lawrence  in  Berkeley  and  Livermore  devel-
oping  fusion  energy  technological  capabilities.  I  can  say  that,  you
know, that is a crucial potential for the very, very long-term future,
but we don’t know what the breakthroughs are that will make that
happen. Should some of those breakthroughs be identified as poten-
tials, and ARPA–E might be a mechanism to test a couple of those
out, or develop the underlying capabilities.

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you very much.
Dr.  VAN ATTA.  When  you  have  to  be  based  upon  ideas,  rather

than just substantive areas.

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you. I yield back. Thank you.

RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY

Chairwoman  GIFFORDS.  Heading  back  to  an  area  that  Mr.
Denniston  talked  about,  one  of  the  goals  of  the  ARPA–E  project  is
to faster innovation of a new U.S. energy technology industry, and
to  create  a  new  workforce  built  around  this  new  sector,  or
greentech.  But  to  the  extent  that  this  market  has  developed  al-
ready,  in  terms  of  now  we  see  that  the  Japanese,  the  Europeans,
and also, the Chinese are starting to gain the lead.

Some  questions  I  would  hope  the  panel  could  answer.  One,  can
ARPA–E  ensure  that  the  United  States  stays  on  the  front  end  of
technological  innovation,  and  supports  the  domestic  energy  indus-
try? Two, should ARPA–E have an explicit Buy America clause, or
otherwise ensure that these technologies are manufactured and de-
ployed in the United States first? Three, what kind of workforce do
you  all  see  developing  around  this  new  clean  energy  technology?
And  fourth,  what  levels  of  education  and  training  are  going  to  be
required for this new workforce?

A lot of questions, but again, just the staying innovative, on top,
the  Buy  America,  the  development  around  the  clean  energy  tech-
nologies, and then, the training.

Mr.  DENNISTON.  I  will  be  happy  to  take  a  shot  and  those,  and

I am sure my colleagues will have their own thoughts.

So, will ARPA–E ensure that the U.S. is on the leading edge and
is  the  leader?  There  is  no  guarantee.  I  would  look  at  the  converse
of  that,  which  is  if  we  don’t  have  an  ARPA–E  or  something  like
that,  I  think  we  have  a  very  low  probability  of  doing  so,  because
as  my  fellow  panelists  have  pointed  out  a  number  of  times,  there
is  no  translational  function  being  performed  today,  and  we  know
that  without  that,  we  will  struggle  to  come  up  with  the  break-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 18:32 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 034719 PO 00000 Frm 00061 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\042607\34719 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

58

throughs. Others are doing that across the world. We are in a glob-
al race, so I think we need it to have a chance to stay at the front
end.

In  terms  of  Buy  America,  I  don’t  even  know  what  that  means.
Does  that  require  that  companies,  U.S.  companies,  not—because
the buyers of these technologies won’t be energy companies, and so,
if the U.S. Federal Government funds research that startup or ma-
ture  companies  roll  out,  do  we  make  other  consumers,  businesses
and consumers buy them? I don’t think that is a good idea. I think
you can create incentives, so I will tell you right now, in both Asia
and in Europe, there are strong incentives to set up manufacturing
there,  tax  incentives,  you  can  do  to  Singapore  and  get  a  ten  year
tax  holiday  for  setting  up  manufacturing  operations  there.  That  is
what  the  U.S.  is  competing  with  to  put  manufacturing  facilities  in
place.  I  don’t  think—you  probably  could  mandate  by  statute  that
all  Americans  buy  all  American  products,  but  that  would  be  un-
American, I think.

Your  third  question  is  what  about  the  workforce.  The  workforce
is,  this  will  be  a  boon  for  technology  and  innovation,  and  what  we
saw  happen  over  the  past  three  decades,  as  the  NIH  budget  quin-
tupled,  is  enormous,  topflight  technical  talent  sprinting  into  the
health  care  field,  the  research  field,  because  that  is  where  the
money was. And that is what we will see happen also in the renew-
able  energy  field  if  there  is  significant  funding,  because  the  best
and the brightest can look at that and say wow, this is a really in-
teresting area, and I can get my projects funded. So, I think on the
technical, scientific level, it is an excellent idea. If there are—there
will  be  manufacturing  as  well,  no  doubt  about  it.  How  much  is  a
function of public policy.

And your last question was on education and training, and I can
tell you from visits that I have made, which I do frequently, to our
top research institutions, academic research institutions, that there
is  enormous  interest  to  pursue  energy,  because  our  best  academic
institutions see that as an area where they can make a difference,
a  growth  area  going  forward,  so  I  think  those  are  your  four  ques-
tions.

Dr. FORREST. I would like to jump in, too, and talk as an educa-

tor, what is like, what is happening out there on the ground.

And  I  am  a  person  who  grew  up  in  the  Space  Race,  the  genera-
tion  of  the  Space  Race,  and  Kennedy,  President  Kennedy  at  the
time  created  a  national  challenge  that  struck  and  galvanized  not
just a generation of young people to go into science and technology,
but  a  generation  of  young  people’s  parents  to  encourage  their  chil-
dren to go and to solve a national need.

I haven’t seen in the interim a challenge that has arisen that has
affected  the  psyche  of  young  people  beyond  that  which  I  now  see
now,  with  sustainability  of  the  environment  and  energy  independ-
ence.  Energy  institutes  are  starting  to  arise,  some  very  formidable
ones, at many universities, our university, the University of Michi-
gan, has just established Michigan Memorial Phoenix Energy Insti-
tute,  which  is  an  antecedent,  it  is  following  on  in  the  footsteps  of
our  Atoms  for  Peace  program,  that  was  established  at  the  end  of
the Second World War.

So, by putting more money into the research end of things, which
ultimately  creates  jobs,  you  will  find  that  there  will  be  a  large,
emerging, and effective workforce that will assure U.S. competitive-
ness. Just establishment of an agency does not do that, but DARPA
has  had  that  effect,  very  much  so,  in  establishing  a  generation  or
multiple  generations  of  young  people  who  have  gone  into  the  tech-
nologies  that  have  been  generated  out  of  DARPA.  And  I  believe
that we are, today, reaping the benefits of those changes.

One  last  point  is  that  if  you  look  at  American  funding  of  alter-
native  energies,  and  alternative  energy  research,  over  the  last
twenty  years,  Japan  has  been  ahead  of  us.  Over  the  last  ten,  Eu-
rope has been ahead of us. They have very rapidly increasing budg-
ets in these areas. Ours is flat or declining in some areas.

So,  I  think  that  if  you  really  talk  about  the  long-term  competi-
tiveness of this Nation, which is coupled directly into our standard
of  living,  this  is  the  place  we  really  have  to  draw  the  line,  and
make some commitments to, for the long-term.

Mr. BONVILLIAN. I wonder if I could add—I am sorry.
Chairwoman  GIFFORDS.  Well,  we  will  start  with  Dr.  Van  Atta,

and could you——

Mr. BONVILLIAN. Sure.
Dr.  VAN ATTA.  It  is  interesting,  on  the  ARPA–E  ensuring  our
leadership. A few months ago, I was over in Japan, at a Japan-U.S.
climate  change  forum  informal  working  group,  and  I  explained,
similar  to  what  I  did  today  here,  the  DARPA  model,  and  how  it
worked,  and  how  it  might  work  in  the  energy  area,  and  the  Japa-
nese  all  were  very  bright  young  technical  people  from  METI,  their
economic  and  technology  institute,  were  both  jealous  and  aston-
ished.

What a wonderful thing. We could never do that here. And basi-
cally, with the notion that that is something that gives us a funda-
mental  advantage  relative  to  them.  They  have  other  advantages,
one of which is they are very, very aware of energy prices, and they
are very, very aware of their environment.

As far as explicit Buy America, the world doesn’t work that way.
If you are going to make these technologies, and make them work,
it  has  got  to  be  global.  It  has  got  to  have  global  impact,  and  we
have  to  be  the  leaders  in  global  technology.  Finding  ways  of  cre-
ating  the  best,  so  that  the  world  comes  to  it  for  affordability  and
quality is what we have to do. Legislating it won’t make it happen.
It doesn’t work in DOD, and it won’t work here either.

As  far  as  the  workforce,  we  are  talking  about  bioengineering,
nanoengineering,  materials,  even  old  technologies  like  physics  and
chemistry, all are going to come to play here. They are going to re-
generate  and  recreate  whole  new  areas,  and  then,  you  are  talking
about  product  manufacturing.  GE  and  windmills,  who  is  going  to
make  those  solar  cells  of  Dr.  Forrest’s?  There  are  going  to  whole
sets  of  technology  leaders,  technology  producers,  the  same  people
who  did  the  Intel  thin  film  microcircuit  technologies  are  going  to
be making his solar cells.

That  is  how  we  are  going  to  generate  a  workforce,  and  you  are
right,  education  and  training  in  science  and  technology,  keeping
that pipeline of young, fresh minds going is crucial. Having the ob-

jectives  toward  changing  our  society,  in  terms  of  our  energy,  our
climate, will draw these students in.

Chairwoman GIFFORDS. Mr. Bonvillian.
Mr.  BONVILLIAN.  I  just  wanted  to  add  a  word  on  the  workforce

and your questions.

I was with an MIT professor this morning who teaches chemical
engineering, who has done a tremendous amount of work on carbon
capture  and  sequestration.  He  decided  to  turn  his  engineering  de-
sign  class  over  to  these  energy  technological  problems.  He  got  an
enrollment  he  couldn’t  believe,  that  he  had  never  seen  before,  80
students.  He  divided  them  into  20  different  teams.  He  said  they
worked  harder  than  he  had  ever  seen  students  work  before.  When
he  came  to  the  end  of  the  semester,  he  said  half  the  teams  ap-
proached him, asking if they could continue working all summer on
the energy problems. This doesn’t happen a lot, and the level of in-
terest  and  enthusiasm  that  is  in  this  energy  issue  is  so  powerful.
I am sure Steve has stories very much like this.

MIT  has  a  campus-wide  energy  initiative.  In  some  key  ways,  it
was  and  is  student-driven.  There  is  a  new  energy  club  started  a
couple of years ago at MIT. They meet every two weeks. They often
have  400  students  at  their  bi-weekly  meetings,  which  is  unheard-
of.  It  is  by  far  the  most  active  student  activity.  So,  there  is  an  in-
credible  amount  of  talent  that  wants  to  go  into  this  energy  field
and find ways into it.

We stimulated a generation of talent into the life sciences by the
increases that we gave to NIH. That research funding put that tal-
ent in that field. Life science is a field where we have world domi-
nance.  This  is  a  competitive  sector  that  no  one  is  close  to,  in  bio-
technology  and  pharmaceuticals.  We  can  do  the  same  thing  here.
Part  of  the  story  is  in  strengthening  our  research  investments,  be-
cause I think the talent is going to be there.

And  let  me  just  mention  one  other  thing  that  DARPA  has  done
over  the  years.  As  Dick  pointed  out,  there  have  been  many
DARPAs,  and  there  are  issues  now  in  some  areas.  But  over  the
years,  DARPA  created  a  tradition  of  what  it  called  ‘‘DARPA  hard’’
problems.  Really  hard  problems.  And  the  nature  of  those  tough
problems  just  drew  talent,  sucked  talent  into  them,  and  produced
incredible  technology  over  the  years.  And  one  of  the  interesting
things  about  an  ARPA–E  model  is  that  you  can  create,  if  you  are
working  on  a  breakthrough,  revolutionary  technology  model,  you
can create those DARPA hard problems, and draw a whole genera-
tion of talent in to attack them. And these are the challenges of our
time.

Chairwoman  GIFFORDS.  Thank  you.  Just  to  clarify,  in  terms  of
the  Buy  America  label,  like  I  say,  one  of  the  goals  of  ARPA–E  is
to focus on the U.S. technology industry, so the idea would be that
these technologies are first manufactured and deployed here in the
United  States,  over  giving  preference  to  another  nation.  So,  and
again,  I  would  have  to  look  at  the  language  of  the  bill,  but  I  just
want  to  make  sure  that  you  know,  we  are  clear,  in  terms  of  meet-
ing the goals, or not meeting those goals.

Mr.  DENNISTON.  I  am  still  struggling  with  the  concept.  I  think
if  ARPA–E  succeeds  in  finding  breakthroughs,  and  the  biggest
problem  is  they  can’t  produce  enough  to  fill  market  demand,  that

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 18:32 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 034719 PO 00000 Frm 00064 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\042607\34719 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

would  be  a  really  good  outcome.  Okay.  That  would  be  a  fabulous
outcome,  and  maybe  at  that  point,  Congress  can  look  at  allocating
that,  but  that  would  be  the  best  success  that  we  could  hope  for,  is
that  we  find  a  breakthrough  that  the  entire  world  is  rushing  to
grab onto and deploy, because it offers huge advantages over fossil
and  nuclear  and  everything  else  that  is  out  there.  I  think  that
would be a very happy circumstance for us to see.

Dr.  VAN ATTA.  I  will  go  so  far  as  to  say  that  if  you  look  at  how
DARPA succeeded in Silicon Valley, the times have changed. If you
fund the generation of ideas, and the development of the prototypes
within  the  U.S.,  through  U.S.  universities  with  U.S.  companies
being  involved,  the  beginnings  of  that  manufacturing  and  produc-
tion  will  happen  in  the  U.S.  Can  you  legislate  that,  and  say  that
is the way it has to be for every one? I think that would be too nar-
row.  Can  you  say  that  is  the  expectations,  when  you  are  funding
people?  I  think  you  can  say  that  you  expect  to  see  that  that  re-
search  will  lead  to  development  of  production  facilities  initially  in
the U.S. If you insist that they stay in the U.S., you will get what
happens with the Motorolas, et cetera, of this world, when they say
if  you  are  trying  to  squeeze  me  down  here,  I  will  go  somewhere
else.

And you have to remember, also, that there are lots of incentives
being  paid  out  in  China  and  elsewhere,  to  bring  people  there.  The
Microsoft  Research  Center  in  Beijing  has  lots  of  incentives  to  be
there, and to develop Chinese-based researchers, because of our ex-
port control laws, so I would be careful that we don’t create the in-
centives  for  people  to  be  elsewhere,  by  creating  things  like  Buy
America,  and  they  say  well,  in  that  case,  we  will  produce  our  re-
search somewhere else.

Chairwoman  GIFFORDS.  And  you  know,  this  question  stemmed
from  suggestions  about  what  should  be  in  the  bill.  It  is  not  cur-
rently written in, but I am glad to have your feedback on that.

Ms. Biggert, please.

ARPA–E PROGRAM STRUCTURE

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Thank  you.  I  am  certainly  open  to  this  concept,
and  I  agree  with  everything  that  you  are  saying,  how  we  need  to
compete,  and  we  need  the  research,  and  we  need  it  done.  I  just
worry  about  actually  putting  it  into  a  single  box,  and  saying  this
is  the  way  it  is  going  to  be  done.  And  the  reason  I  say  that  is  I
have  to  tell  you  my  DARPA  story,  and  I  had  a  group  come  in  to
see  me,  and  they  were  scientists  who  were,  had  spun  off  from  Ar-
gonne,  so  they  were  looking  how  they  were  going  to  get  this,  get
their product to market. And it was a product that would, the mili-
tary would be the focus.

So,  they  applied  to  DARPA,  and  they,  and  they  developed,  pro-
duced inexpensive, high quality titanium, which could be rolled out,
and  it  was  something  that  the  Department  of  Defense  was  search-
ing for. They were turned down, so they came to my office, and we
started  to  work  on  it,  yet  I  got  some  funding  for  them  to  further
develop.  You  know,  you  are  talking  about  where  a  company  is  in
the development, but they haven’t been able to produce enough, to
get it to work on a high scale. So, it was obvious that this worked,
and  finally  got  the  Department  of  Energy,  or  Department  of  De-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 18:32 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 034719 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\042607\34719 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

62

fense, to take a look at it again, and it was exactly what they were
looking  for,  that  they  had  to  have,  to  produce  a  product  by  2008.
So,  they  are  now  producing  it  for  them,  and  what  worries  me  is
here was a product that was right there in front of their faces, and
they  didn’t  see  it.  It  didn’t,  you  know,  at  that  time.  So,  they,  the
scientists  got  private  capital,  built  a  plant,  and  demonstrated  that
it  worked,  and  then  DARPA  decided  to,  and  this  was  high  risk,  so
the story ends that both DOE and Boeing, the largest consumer of
titanium in the world, joined the Army to discuss this in my office,
and suddenly, it just took off.

And that is why I worry, and here is the homeland security that
hasn’t  worked.  I  mean,  we—a  couple  weeks  ago,  I  had  the  Sec-
retary  of  Energy  out  at  my  district,  again,  to  look  at  some  of  the
companies  that  are  in  the  district,  and  how  they  are  transitioning
from  the,  you  know,  the  early  development,  they  are  all  spin-offs
from Argonne, and they are working to put their products out, and
they are going to be in high demand. We have got nanotechnology,
we  have  got,  you  know,  all  kinds  of  companies  that  are  able  to
produce these now.

I don’t want to stifle any, you know, of that type of—if this would
be  a  place  where  everybody  is  going  to  come  to,  and  it  is  going
to——

Dr.  FORREST.  I  can’t  comment  directly  on  the  case  that  you  are
alluding  to,  but  I  would  like  to  make  two  distinctions  first  of  all,
or  two  statements.  One  is  we  don’t  have  a  system  in  any  agency
or part of government which is perfect. Mistakes do get made. But
I  don’t  think  that  anyone  here  is  also  advocating  that  all  energy
funding get filtered through an ARPA–E. There is still tremendous
amounts  of  funding  that  we  would  anticipate  would  continue  to
flow  through  the  same  sources  as  always,  through  the  Office  of
Science,  to  the  National  Labs,  that  would  fund  basic  energy  re-
search and so on.

ARPA–E is filling a gap, and that is all it is doing, and that gap
is  the  translational  gap.  The  good  news  about  this  country  is  we
have  a  diversity  of  solutions  to  any  problem,  and  so  the  one  that
you  allude  to,  it  seems  like  the  problem  was  solved  in  any  event.
We  don’t  expect  perfection  from  ARPA–E,  but  we  do  all  recognize,
I  believe,  that  there  is  this  very  critical  function  that  it  can  fill,
which is currently unmet as a need.

Dr.  VAN ATTA.  I  can  comment  on  this,  in  terms  of  I  used  to  run
some  of  the  programs  at  the  Pentagon  dealing  with  some  of  the
Title  III,  Defense  Production  Act,  which  dealt  with  a  fair  amount
of  the  materials  areas.  I  think  both  the  DOD  and  the  government
in  general  needs  to  have  a  little  more  focus  on  the  fundamental,
underlying,  crucial  needs  for  advanced  materials  and  alternative
materials,  including  metals.  Metals  tend  to  get  kind  of  short-
shrifted.  They  seem  old,  but  there  is  lots  of  new  and  interesting
things,  as  we  are  getting  more  and  more  sophisticated  in  some  of
our technologies.

On  the  other  hand,  there  is  an  important  point  here,  which  is
this  diversity  of  alternatives  that  this  country  has,  that  you  know,
blows the other guys away. They can’t understand that we have so
many  mechanisms,  the  Advanced  Technology  Program  in  Com-
merce,  which  is  now,  I  guess,  has  been  modified  and  changed.  We

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 18:32 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 034719 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\042607\34719 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

63

have  mechanisms  that  allow  people  to  find,  that  are  ways  of  get-
ting that technology in.

It  is  important  that  one  not  presume  that  a  single  agency  is
going  to  solve  all  the  problems.  DARPA  doesn’t  solve  all  of  DOD’s
problems.  That  is  why  we  have  a  whole  range  of  other  systems
within  the  services,  et  cetera.  And  you  can’t  expect  or  think  that
this  agency  is  going  to  provide  the  complete  one  stop  shop  across
all, nor should it think itself as that. Otherwise—and we are going
to have a competition for ideas and competition for resources here,
and  I  know  there  is  a  concern  that  this  will  mean  that  the  pros-
pects are that some other existing organization, whether it is a de-
fense  lab,  or  some  other  organization,  a  DOE  lab,  or  the  S&T  pro-
gram, is going to say well, gee, if this thing comes alive, it is going
to, some prospects will take money from us. And the answer is the
competition  amongst  organizations  to  fill  our  national  needs  is  a
good thing. And just because something new and different is going
to  hit  the  street  doesn’t  mean  that  we  should  suddenly  say  well,
okay, wait a minute, we have got this program, that program, they
are going to be at risk. They have to compete on the basis of merit,
what they are doing for the country, and meeting their needs.

And  if  we  have  a  fundamental  unmet  need  here,  which  I  think
we have tried to demonstrate here, that has to get on the table and
compete with those other ideas.

ENERGY RESEARCH FUNDING

Mr.  DENNISTON.  There  has  been  a  suggestion  a  couple  times  in
this  hearing  of  a  concern  that  increased  federal  research  funding
for  energy  would  crowd  out  private  alternatives,  and  I  disagree
with that suggestion, and I will tell you why, for two reasons.

The  first  is  the  current  level  of  private  investment  in  energy  re-
search is very, very, very small, compared to the industries that we
are talking about. So, the annual revenue of the energy and trans-
portation  industries  in  the  aggregate  is  $1.8  trillion.  The  venture
capital  industry  last  year  invested,  depending  on  who  you  ask,  $1
or $2 billion. Some larger companies invest some, but it doesn’t add
up  to  nearly  one  tenth  of  one  percent  of  industry  revenues,  and  if
you show me an industry that is investing one tenth of one percent
in research and development, I can tell you that is an industry that
is not investing for the future.

We  need  more  research  funding.  Historically,  the  government
has  been  an  integral  part  of  that,  and  so,  my  suggestion  is  we
should let the best idea win. If that best idea comes out of ARPA–
E  or  some  other  federal  research  funding,  as  it  did  in  the  health
care field for the past 30 years, that will get transferred over to pri-
vate  industry,  and  we  will  have  a  very  successful  American  com-
pany, and it is much better that that idea come from the U.S. than
from  a  foreign  country,  and  by  increasing  federal  energy  research
funding,  we  increase  the  probability  that  America  leads  the  next
industrial revolution.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Maybe  it  should  be  the  technology  revolution,

but——

Mr. DENNISTON. Sure.
Dr.  VAN ATTA.  I  wanted  to  make  a  point  on  the  private  invest-
ment. I did a study a bit ago, as I do do studies, on the role of ven-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 18:32 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 034719 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\042607\34719 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

64

ture  capital  in  DOD,  and  it  was  interesting.  I  interviewed  several
people,  including  Kleiner  Perkins  and  some  others,  and  one  of  the
things  that  was  interesting  is  I  asked  where  do  you  go  as  venture
capitalists  think  of  the  next  ideas  where  things  would  come  from.
They say we look at DARPA. Where are they going?

So,  the  amount  of  money  that  goes  into  areas  of  interest  has  a
lot to do with the kind of money that government is putting in that
shows interest and shows direction. SEMATECH helped create gov-
ernment,  industry  investments  in  semiconductor  manufacturing  in
this country, that the Intels, the IBMs, the Motorolas and all, built
on. So, the interrelationship, that partnership between the govern-
ment  and  industry,  is  crucial.  And  we  have  to  realize  that  that  is
now  happening  around  the  world,  so  we  are  in  a  competitive  race
when you see what other governments are doing to encourage that
R&D  and  that  technology  development.  And  that  is  based  upon
their  interest  in  achieving  their  competitive  status  versus  us.  And
we  have  to  realize  this  is  now  a  hypercompetitive  world  in  these
areas,  and  if  we  want  to  rest  on  our  laurels,  we  are  going  to  have
to be worried where we are going to be in 15, 20 years.

Ms. BIGGERT. Well, 50 percent of GDP in the last 50 years is the
result  of  research  and  development,  so  we  have  got  to  continue
with this. Thank you very much. I yield back.

RECOUPMENT

Chairwoman  GIFFORDS.  Thank  you.  In  Chairman  Gordon’s  ab-
sence,  I  would  like  the  panel  to  address  this  question  that  he
talked  about  on  terms  of  recouping,  recoupment  of  dollars.  There
is a provision in the bill, it calls for the Secretary to develop proce-
dures  to  recoup  the  federal  share  of  commercially  successful
projects under ARPA–E, and gives the Secretary authority to waive
the provision.

So,  I  am  curious  if  members  of  our  panel  think  that  is  a  good

idea or not a good idea, and why.

Mr. BONVILLIAN. Maybe I can start off. I am concerned about this
provision.  Essentially,  you  want  to  encourage  new  technologies  to
be  stood  up,  but  you  are  putting  on  a  clause  on  them  that  essen-
tially  allows  recapture  up  to  a  20  year  period,  and  I  think  that  is
a  burden  that  we  should  not  impose  on  new  ideas  and  new  tech-
nologies.

Somebody is going to have to pay that bill, and the R&D invest-
ment  is  going  to  be  discounted  on  day  one,  as  that  technology  is
stood up. Everybody is going to know that it is going to have to get
repaid  at  some  future  date,  and  it  is  going  to  be  a  burden  on  the
standup  process.  We  have  not  imposed  recoupment  on  any  other
federal R&D. I think, frankly, it has been a very smart strategy on
our  part.  We  capture  the  cost  of  the  great  new  technologies  we
stand  up  through  the  R&D  process  through  the  tax  system.  We
stand up small companies, they become successful, we tax them at
a  pretty  tough  corporate  rate.  That  is  the  way  the  government  op-
erates.  We  don’t  tax  the  new  technologies.  We  don’t  want  to  dis-
courage new technologies. Let us just recoup it through the tax sys-
tem at a later stage.

So,  I  am  concerned  about  this.  Now,  in  my  view,  the  immediate
problem that we have is adequate revenue to stand this new entity

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 18:32 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 034719 PO 00000 Frm 00068 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\042607\34719 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

65

up at the beginning. A recoupment clause is not going to help solve
that problem. It is a much later stage recovery problem.

Now, there will, at some point, I trust, in the next few years, be
some  kind  of  cap  and  trade  macro  pricing  system  that  will  be  im-
posed  on  various  energy-dependent  economic  sectors  in  the  United
States.  That  cap  and  trade  proposal  is  going  to  raise  very  signifi-
cant  income  through  the  initial  auctions,  and  auctions  continue  on
an  annualized  basis  in  the  bills  that  are  currently  in  front  of  the
Congress.

Typically,  the  government’s  recovery  at  the  initial  auction  stage
is  comparatively  low.  You  want  to  give  people  time  to  transition,
but  that  recovery  goes  up  over  a  period  of  time.  These  allocations
are  going  to  generate  tens  of  billions  of  dollars,  and  we  will  be
making  a  foolish  mistake  if  we  don’t  spend  a  lot  of  that  cap  and
trade allocation money on the new technologies and the innovation
system that we are going to need.

So,  I  think  that  what  we  have  here  is  an  interim  problem,  be-
tween now and then, to stand ARPA–E up with adequate revenues.
There also may be some other revenues in the oil and gas royalties
area,  that  you  could  look  at,  which  I  know  some  of  the  Committee
has  taken  a  look  at  already.  That  seems  to  be  a  possibility.  You
may  also  want  to  consider  an  initial  one  year  sizable  grant  here.
The  country  is  going  to  have  to  spend  a  lot  more  money  on  our
energy  R&D.  Otherwise,  we  are  going  to  cede  the  energy  innova-
tion territory. And therefore, I know these investments are coming.
I worry that a recoupment clause, by taxing technology, as opposed
to successful companies, is a problematic way to go.

Dr.  FORREST.  I  would  also  like  to  chime  in  on  that  one.  I  have
been fortunate enough to have been a partner in several companies
that started up. One of the companies was financed almost entirely
through  the  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  Program.  It  is
called  Sensors  Unlimited.  Over  the  years,  it  brought  in  probably  a
few million dollars worth of SBIR money at the height of the Inter-
net bubble, it sold for $700 million. The return to the Federal Gov-
ernment  from  that  sale  was—the  CEO  of  that  company  calculated
something like 20 to one, compared to the investment.

To  have  unfettered  investment  is  very  important.  I  would  also
like to say that I have seen these type of clauses in state law. Very
often,  they  get  tangled  up  in  the  agreements  that  companies  al-
ready  have  with  their  primary  investors,  because  there  is  payback
clauses  there,  too.  And  so,  what  happens  is  the  government  now
becomes  a  competitor  against  the  private  sector  when  it  does  this
sort of thing, and it is very, I think, detrimental. Many grants like
that  from  the  state  that  I  am  in  today  have  come  under  question,
and  have  been  turned  back,  and  have  not  been  accepted.  I  think
this  is  a  damper  on  real  innovation.  The  Federal  Government  has
been  an  excellent  partner  in  driving  innovation,  understanding
that  by  creating  prosperity,  it  gets  all  the  returns  it  needs,  and  to
try  to  do  this  in  a  micro-way  with  a  specific  program,  I  think,  has
a detrimental effect, a dampening effect.

Mr. DENNISTON. I would echo Dr. Forrest’s comments. I urge the
Committee  to  pass  a  bill  with  significant  increased  funding  levels.
I  know  this  is  hard,  a  high  degree  of  difficulty,  but  significant  in-

crease  in  funding  levels  and  no  recoupment.  You  will  see  my  com-
ments in my written remarks.

I  pity  the  ARPA–E  Director  with  a  recoupment  clause,  because
now,  there  are  two  missions  that  stand  in  conflict.  The  first  is  to
race  technologies  and  solutions  to  the  market,  but  the  second  is  to
do it with ankle weights on, and the recoupment clause is an ankle
weight,  because  it  requires  negotiation  with  universities,  with  pri-
vate  industry.  We  have  seen  this  movie  before.  It  will  slow  the
process  down,  so  fundamentally,  I  think  the  Subcommittee  has  to
decide  whether  to  rank  order  priorities.  Is  the  top  priority  to  solve
the  problems,  climate  change,  energy  dependence,  American  com-
petitiveness?  Or  is  it  to  make  this  ARPA–E  revenue-neutral?  And
for me, I have to express some frustration as an American, a voter,
a  taxpayer,  that  we  find  ourselves  in  a  budget  predicament  where
we are faced with a crisis, and we can’t find budget for it. It is tre-
mendously frustrating. That is a different topic for a different day.
I  agree  with  Mr.  Bonvillian’s  comment  that  if  ARPA–E  succeeds,
and  we  create  breakthrough  technologies,  the  Federal  Treasury
will be repaid many times over, in the form of income tax and pay-
roll  tax  revenue.  And  if  you  want  to  recoup,  then  earmark  those
tax  dollars,  send  them  back  to  ARPA–E.  That  is  the  way  to  repay
ARPA–E without putting ankle weights on from the get-go.

Dr.  VAN ATTA.  There  is  quite  a  bit  more  complication  to  this,  as
well.  I  agree  with  the  comments  that  were  made  up  to  this  point.
Who  is  going  to  pay  that  recoupment?  Is  it  going  to  be  Google?
Is  it  going  to  be  Cisco?  Is  it  going  to  be  Sun  Microsystems?  For
many  of  the  things  that  people  are  using,  that  were  funded  by
DARPA,  the  first  guys  who  got  the  money  weren’t  the  guys  who
succeeded.  It  was  the  guys  after  that,  or  the  guys  who  built  on
that,  or  the  guys  who  spun  off  of  that.  You  can’t  track  that.  You
can’t  evaluate  that.  There  are  a  few.  There  are  a  few.  If  you  go  to
QUALCOMM  and  Irwin  Jacobs,  he  will  tell  you,  I  got  my  money
from building up this TMA, it came from DARPA, working on a De-
fense  problem,  working  with  the  Defense  Department,  and  you
know  that  QUALCOMM  is  paying  the  government  back  hand-
somely,  in  terms  of  its  revenues  and  all  that  it  is  making  today.
The  crucial  problem  here  is  the  recoupment  assumes  that  there
is  a  linear  relationship  between  the  dollars  in  and  the  results  out.
It  is  not  linear,  in  terms  of  the  dollars,  and  you  have,  you  know,
the one percent of the guys who succeeded makes you a billion dol-
lars, but those guys may not have been the guys who got the origi-
nal  money.  In  fact,  finding  that  and  tracking  that,  there  will  be  a
lot  of  deniability  here.  Well,  yeah,  DARPA  was  over  there  some-
where, but I forgot all about them.

So, you have to be, I don’t see how that works.

FOSTERING AN INNOVATIVE CULTURE

Chairwoman GIFFORDS. A couple final questions. In terms of, and
something that all of you talked about, the independence of ARPA–
E, how do we actually ensure that, and what have we learned from
even  the  Congressional  pressures  that  DARPA  has  experienced
over time? How has DARPA insulated itself, and how, possibly, can
we  write  into  the  bill  that  ARPA–E  is  kept  really,  truly  inde-
pendent?

67

Dr. VAN ATTA. Let me speak to that first, because I have actually
addressed  that  issue  a  couple  of  times.  You  can’t  legislate  inde-
pendence.  You  have  to  raise  the  expectations  that  it  will  be  inde-
pendent, but you have an oversight role in Congress. So, you have,
you  know,  there  is  a  fundamental  oversight  role  in  terms  of  the
budget, and in terms of expectations. You can state that the organi-
zation  should  be  independent  of  specific  and  identified  entities
within the Departments through the management structure.

You  can’t  guarantee  that  the  bureaucracy  will  leave  it  alone.
HSARPA  is  a  great  example  of  that.  But  I  do  think  that  you  can
manage it, and you can evaluate it, based upon the degree to which
it  has  demonstrated  results.  The  basic  way  that  DARPA  has  man-
aged to keep itself at least less prone to earmarks than other orga-
nizations  is  it  can  demonstrate  that  what  it  is  already  doing  is  so
impactful  and  so  necessary  that  they  have  been  able  to  convince
the Congress and the staffs that you shouldn’t start throwing more
stuff  at  it  and  diverting  it,  though  there  have  been  some  very  big
earmarks  put  on  by  Congress  that  went  into  DARPA,  including
SEMATECH. So, it is not that it has been completely independent,
but it hasn’t been completely dependent, either.

The other issue is it doesn’t come back and ask Congress to help
it with money. It puts its program out there, and says this is what
we  want  to  do,  and  it  is  not  hurting  for  money,  so  it  keeps  saying
put  more  things  in  there.  I  think  having  a  definitive,  well  laid  out
charter and mission, and permission to implement that, is the best
way  of  doing  that.  It  is  very  hard  to  legislate  that,  except  to  set
the expectations of the independence.

Chairwoman GIFFORDS. Mr. Bonvillian.
Mr.  BONVILLIAN.  One  model,  which  the  Committee,  I  know,  has
been  thinking  about,  is  the  wholly  owned  government  corporation
model, and you know, as we have all discussed for innovation enti-
ties  in  the  business  of  standing  up  new  technologies,  a  very  suc-
cessful  model  has  been  to  put  them  on  a  protective  island  that  is
comparatively free from contending bureaucracies.

One  way  to  do  that  is  through  a  wholly  owned  government  cor-

poration. There are some——

out. What was that again?

Chairwoman GIFFORDS. I am sorry, Mr. Bonvillian. The mike cut

Mr. BONVILLIAN. One way to do that is to create the entity with-
in  a  wholly  owned  government  corporation.  Locating  an  ARPA–E
in  a  corporation  would  assure  it  significant  hiring  flexibility,  com-
petitive  salary  structures,  a  certain  freedom  from  Congressional
earmarking interference, which, let us face it, will be an issue. And
a  corporation  model  can  move  it  out  of  slower  moving  government
bureaucratic  procedures.  So,  there  is  significant  advantage  here.
Some of these issues, you can fix in a statutory structure, including
the  contracting  flexibility,  and  some  of  the  employment  hiring
speed issues, but the corporation is an easier model for the standup
process.

Now,  there  is  a  big  issue  here  with  a  government  corporation,
which  is  that  you  have  to  have  the  bridge  back  to  leadership.  If  a
wholly  owned  government  corporation  is  facing  tough  contending
interests  with  political  power,  and  let  us  face  it,  we  have  that  in
the energy field in spades, it is difficult for the corporation to main-

tain its independence, and to assure its ongoing viability, and par-
ticularly,  to  obtain  ongoing  funding.  There  may  be  battles  about
this an ongoing basis.

So,  there  are  advantages  to  the  corporation  model.  The  way  in
which  you  make  the  model  work,  and  it  is  not  simple,  is  to  make
sure  there  is  a  very  strong  bridge  back  to  political  leadership  that
is  prepared  to  have  a  stake  in  the  corporate  entity,  understand  it,
back  its  research  efforts,  and  provide  it  a  certain  kind  of  political
screen and protection in the process.

Getting that balance right will be crucial. Otherwise, you are just
going  to  have  an  island  out  there.  But  I  do  toss  that  out,  throw
that out to you, as a possible model that you may want to consider.
You  can  do  many  of  the  same  things  within  DOE.  In  other  words,
this  is  not  an  either/or  option.  You  can  create  an  island-bridge
within  DOE  as  well,  but  I  think  you  should  at  least  explore  the
wholly owned government corporation.

Dr. VAN ATTA. I would like to add a little bit more, Bill, to what

you just said, because——

Chairwoman GIFFORDS. And Dr. Van Atta, can you also take into
consideration whether or not there should be a written mission, be-
cause that is part of it as well, that we need to be looking at?

Dr. VAN ATTA. Yeah, I would say first of all, the fact that DARPA
does  report  to  the  highest  level,  the  Secretary  of  Defense,  though
administratively,  that  has  linked  it  more  to  the  Office  of  Acquisi-
tion, Technology, and Logistics. It is—the DARPA Director still re-
ports  to  the  Secretary  of  Defense,  and  his  mission,  if  you  will,  if
you  go  to  the  mission,  is  to  achieve  the  goals  of  the  Secretary,  as
related to the goals of the President.

It  is  not  to  meet  service  goals.  It  is  not  to  meet  individual  goals
of  a  particular  sub-organization.  And  I  think  the  mission,  relative
to  sustaining  U.S.  leadership  in  energy  technologies  for  both  secu-
rity  and  for  climate  change  is  a  fundamental  issue  that  should  be
the  issue,  the  mission  of  this  organization,  and  it  should  report  to
that  mission,  at  the  highest  level.  And  it  is  at  that  highest  level,
not  through  all  these  other  mechanisms  and  bureaucracies,  sub-
tiers,  et  cetera,  that  you  maintain  that  independence.  Keep  it  out
of  the  bureaucratic  strains,  bureaucratic  structures,  as  we  said.
HSARPA failed because it was part of, embedded in, and it had to
report  budgetarily  through  all  those  other  mechanisms.  While
DARPA informs the DDR&E about its budget, it sets its own budg-
et,  in  terms  of  how  it  allocates  its  dollars.  It  doesn’t  have  to  get
approval from anybody as to how it allocates those dollars. That is
crucial, and that is something which is set, not by legislation. It is
set  by  administrative  expectations  within  the  organization,  in
terms  of  ensuring  its  independence,  and  the  Secretary  protects
that.

FUNDING

Chairwoman  GIFFORDS.  My  final  question,  I  know  we  have  kept
you here for a couple of hours, but this is, I think, really the meat
of it, the Gathering Storm report calls for the ARPA–E to authorize
$300  million  for  the  first  year,  and  then  quickly  escalate  up  to  $1
billion within five years.

69

H.R.  364  currently  has  a  similar  funding  profile,  but  some  sug-
gest  that  the  only  way  a  high  cost,  risk-tolerant  program  like
ARPA–E  will  be  successful  is  if  it  is  dedicated  funding  of  some
kind,  therefore  would  not  be  subject  to  annual  appropriations  or
other  political  or  perhaps  financial  pressures  or  resource  fluctua-
tions that might stifle this sort of innovation.

So,  I  am  curious  whether  or  not  this  level  of  investment  pre-
scribed  in  H.R.  364  matches  the  magnitude  of  the  challenges  that
we have talked about, and whoever wants to start.

Mr. DENNISTON. I will repeat what I said before, which is I think
it  is  dangerously  deficient.  I  think  if  you  look  at,  again,  the  scope
of the crises that we face, the scale of these industries, energy and
transportation,  $300  million  pursuing  change,  well,  ARPA–E,  the
current  draft  of  ARPA–E  says  first  year,  $300  million,  going  up  to
$915  million  in  2012.  It  is  to  go  to  fossil,  nuclear,  renewable.  It  is
at  all  stages  of  energy  research,  basic,  demonstration,  and  by  the
way, it is recoupable.

It  doesn’t—when  you  put  all  those  factors  across  what  the  stat-
ute  is  proposing,  my  fear  is  it  is  not  going  to  do  very  much  at  all.
It  is  $300  million  on  a  $1.8  trillion  industry,  is  a  rounding  error.
And we just have to do better if we want to place solving our crises,
our energy crises as a top national priority. I hope we can do that.
Dr.  FORREST.  Let  me  just  give  you  a  little  perspective.  That
builds on that $2 trillion number. If this were a business now, John
will  know  more  about  this  than  I  do,  but  most  high  tech  busi-
nesses,  technology  businesses,  or  businesses  that  are  really  in-
volved in the next generation of whatever product they are making,
typically about five to 10 percent gets ploughed back into R&D. So,
you  can  assume  that  that  $1  trillion  is  bringing  in  about  $100  bil-
lion of money to make change.

But  unfortunately,  it  is  really  to  embed,  most  of  that  money  is
coming in through the oil industry, so it is being invested to make
sure  that  we  have  oil  into  the  future  from  whatever  source.  So,  if
we  are  going  to  counter  that  with  renewables  for  all  the  reasons
that  we  have  talked  about  today,  we  have  to  at  least  get  on  the
map,  and  while  there  is  always  a  start-up  problem,  how  do  you
spend money wisely, you can’t just put a lot of money on the table
instantaneously,  but  that  has  to  be  a  phase-in  to  something  that
really  is  equal  to  the  problem,  and  I  believe,  like  John  does,  that
$1 billion is just woefully underfunded.

Mr.  BONVILLIAN.  So,  I  get  a  shot  at  it?  I  know  the  budget  prob-
lems that the Congress faces, and they are painful, and how do you
find  $300  million,  and  persuade  the  appropriators  to  allocate  it,
much  less  $1  billion.  These  are  DARPA-sized  problems.  DARPA  is
a  $3  billion  agency,  right?  If  anything,  these  energy  problems  are
more  dramatic,  in  some  ways,  than  what  DARPA  faces.  How  are
you going to pull that off?

As  I  said  before,  I  do  think  that  there  is  a  reasonable  prospect
over time, that there are going to be significant revenues if we im-
pose a cap and trade system, and Europe, and the rest of the devel-
oping  world,  is  moving  in  that  direction.  I  think  we  are  going  to
have  to  fall  into  sync  with  that  process  over  a  period  of  time.  So,
I  think  there  will  be  a  significant  revenue  stream  out  there,  and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 18:32 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 034719 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\042607\34719 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

70

it  would  be  a  tragedy  if  we  didn’t  invest  that  revenue  stream  sig-
nificantly in R&D.

But  you  have  got  a  standup  period  in  the  interim,  and  I  don’t
want  to  say  that  $1  billion  on  energy  R&D  is  not  worth  spending.
It is. $1 billion in the earlier research stages can do a lot, but get-
ting  even  to  $1  billion  is  going  to  be  tough  to  ask  for.  Obviously,
you  have  to  even  this  in  over  a  period  of  time.  I  would  also  just
urge you to think about other potential revenue sources that might
be out there, and there may be some royalty sources that you want
to look at.

Dr.  VAN ATTA.  I  guess  I  am  an  optimist,  in  the  sense  of  saying
that  you  know,  first  of  all,  you  have  to  start  things  up,  and  if  you
are  going  to  start  things  up,  you  need  to  do  it  in  a  focused  way,
that  gets  things  going  on  a  success  path.  So  I  think  if  one  could
start with $300 million in a focused way, not try and take on every-
thing,  you  would  be  doing  something  very  good,  and  that  probably
would  be,  in  my  mind,  probably  starting  $300  million  on  renew-
ables, as the area where, I think, the most dollars can do the most
advantage.

Scaling  then  becomes  an  issue,  and  I  think  you  do  have  a  ques-
tion  as  to  how  do  you  scale,  and  I  think,  and  what  is  the  right
amount of money. Too much money is also not a good thing. I think
you  want  to  have  an  organization  that  is  somewhat  lean.  I  think
if they could scale up to $1 billion, and then prove that they could
do  good  with  that,  and  then  deserve  more,  that  is  fine.  There  is  a
point  at  which  even  DARPA  agrees  that  more  money  is  probably
not a good thing, in order to do what its unique role is. Otherwise,
it  is  probably  going  way  beyond  its  original  charters  into,  in  fact,
development type programs and projects, as opposed to the kind of
front-end advanced development proof-of-concept work.

So,  maybe  I  am  a  little  different  in  mind,  in  terms  of  where  I
think this fits in the scale of things. I think if we can get the $300
million,  get  something  started  in  a  focused  way,  sort  of  like  the
Presidential initiatives when DARPA was first created, in terms of
three key things, get that up and running, then say all right, based
upon  that,  let  us  move  forward,  based  upon  our  success  path  with
the  objective  of  at  least  $1  billion,  and  if  we  can  go  further  than
that, if it is justified, fine.

DARPA  didn’t  start  off  with  a  dollar  bogie.  DARPA  started  off
with a problem bogie. And I think the problem here is that we have
to  focus  on  getting  the  momentum  going.  If  there  is  a  way  of  get-
ting  more  money  in  at  the  start,  fine,  but  you  know,  starting  with
too much money can be a problem, too. I will use SDI as an exam-
ple, too much money, there is a problem of too much money chasing
too few ideas.

Right  now,  we  have  lots  of  ideas  up  there.  I  think  getting  some
money  out  there  to  start  sifting  and  sorting  amongst  those  ideas
is  crucial.  Starting  with  $300  million,  if  that  is  what  we  have  got,
let  us  start  with  it.  If  we  can  get  some  more,  $500,  that  would  be
good, too.

Dr.  FORREST.  Just  to  circle  back  on  that,  just  very  briefly,  is  we
have to understand that the energy problem is probably, by all ac-
countings,  the  biggest  crisis  that  humanity  is  facing  in  this  cen-
tury. There are six billion people on this planet. Two billion people

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 18:32 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 034719 PO 00000 Frm 00074 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\042607\34719 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

71

today  do  not  have  access  to  electricity.  Now,  that  is  not  going  to
last for long. Those two billion people are going to be burning very
dirty, the dirtiest form of coal and fossil fuels.

If  you  think  we  have  a  problem  now,  it  is  only  beginning,  so  we
have  to  first  understand  the  challenge,  the  level  of  the  crisis.  We
will, this country will find a way. I couldn’t, as I said before, I can’t
tell  you  the  right  level  of  funding,  but  we  really  have  to  make  it
match  the  situation.  We  have  to  understand  that  the  situation  we
are  finding  ourselves  in  today,  both  from  a  competitive,  security,
and  environmental  aspect.  And  if  we  do  that,  and  start  marching
forward, we will find that right number.

Chairwoman GIFFORDS. Well, I want to thank all of our panelists
today for coming to testify. It was incredibly interesting discussion,
and inspiring as well.

We  have  a  lot  of  work  to  do  in  Congress,  and  knowing  that  we
have  the  four  of  you  for  resources,  and  knowing  the  direction  that
Chairman  Gordon  is  taking  this  issue  in,  I  think  that  we  have  a
lot to look forward to.

Under  the  rules  of  the  Committee,  the  record  will  be  held  open
for  two  weeks  for  Members  to  submit  additional  statements  and
any additional questions they might have for the witnesses.

If  there  is  no  objection,  the  witnesses  are  dismissed,  and  the

meeting is adjourned. Thank you.

Mr. BONVILLIAN. Thank you.
Mr. DENNISTON. Thank you very much.
[Whereupon, at 4:16 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF H.R. 364

Summary

H.R. 364 establishes an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy within the
U.S. Department of Energy. Modeled after the Department of Defense’s Defense Ad-
vanced Research Projects Agency, ARPA–E is a new program charged with the mis-
sion of reducing U.S. dependence on oil through the rapid development and commer-
cialization of transformational clean energy technologies. This bill follows on the rec-
ommendations of the National Academy of Sciences’ report ‘‘Rising Above the Gath-
ering  Storm:  Energizing  and  Employing  America  for  a  Brighter  Economic  Future.’’
Section-by-Section
Section 1. Findings

The  U.S.  can  meet  long-term  energy  challenges  through  sustained  investment  in
energy research programs at DOE augmented by an innovative and aggressive new
energy  technology  development  effort  based  on  the  same  operating  principles  that
make DARPA successful.
Section 2. Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy

Establishes the Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA–E) within the
Department of Energy. Similar to the Department of Defense’s successful Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA), this new organizational structure will be better
positioned  to  support  revolutionary  and  transformational  energy  research  where
risk and pay-offs are high.

The stated goal of ARPA–E is to reduce the dependence of the U.S. on foreign en-
ergy  sources  by  20  percent  over  the  next  10  years.  To  achieve  this  ARPA–E  should
support  targeted  high-risk,  high  pay-off  research  to  accelerate  the  innovation  cycle
for  both  traditional  and  alternative  energy  sources  and  energy  efficiency.  ARPA–E
shall be headed by a Director, appointed by the Secretary, who will administer com-
petitive  grants,  cooperative  agreements,  contracts  or  similar  transactions  with  uni-
versities, industry and consortia which may include federal labs.

Organization  of  ARPA–E  will  be  very  flat  and  nimble  to  avoid  bureaucratic  im-
pediments  that  stifle  innovation  today.  The  Director  shall  designate  program  man-
agers  who  will  have  flexibility  in  establishing  R&D  goals  for  the  program,  publi-
cizing goals, issuing solicitations and selecting projects for support as well as moni-
toring  their  progress.  Projects  will  be  chosen  based  on  factors  such  as  novelty,  sci-
entific and technical merit, applicant’s capabilities and other criteria as the Director
determines. ARPA–E will have authority to hire specialized science and engineering
personnel to be program managers. (This is similar to DARPA and HS–ARPA.)

In  addition,  the  Director  shall  ensure  that  ARPA–E’s  activities  are  coordinated
with other federal research agencies and that ARPA–E may carry out projects joint-
ly with other agencies.
Section. 3. Energy Independence Acceleration Fund

Establishes  the  Energy  Independence  Acceleration  Fund  administered  by  the  Di-
rector  of  ARPA–E.  Funding  is  authorized  from  FY  2008  thru  2013  ramping  up  25
percent per year from an initial authorization of $300 million to $915 million.
Section 4. Recoupment

If  a  project  is  successful  the  Federal  Government  can  recoup  some  of  its  original
investment.  The  provision  allows  the  Secretary  complete  flexibility  in  developing
recoupment agreements, and the ability to waive it entirely if necessary for the com-
mercial  viability  of  a  project.  All  recouped  funds  will  be  returned  to  the  Energy
Independence Acceleration Fund.
Section 5. Advisory Committee

The  ARPA–E  Advisory  Committee  may  seek  advice  either  from  an  existing  DOE
advisory  committee  or  may  establish  a  new  advisory  committee.  If  the  Director  of
ARPA–E  requires  industry  advice,  a  panel  to  advise  on  a  specific  technology  area,
or to hire an outside consultant, this provision provides the appropriate authorities.
Section 6. ARPA–E Evaluation

At  the  end  of  five  and  one-half  years,  the  President’s  Committee  on  Science  and
Technology  (PCAST)  shall  evaluate  how  well  ARPA–E  has  performed  in  achieving
its  goals  and  mission.  The  Committee  is  required  to  recommend  whether  ARPA–E
should be continued or terminated as well as lessons learned from its operation.
