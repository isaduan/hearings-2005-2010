Security’s R&D Budget

Priorities for Fiscal Year 2008

THURSDAY, MARCH 8, 2007

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

1. Purpose

On  Thursday,  March  8,  the  Subcommittee  on  Technology  and  Innovation  of  the
Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  will  hold  a  hearing  to  consider  the  Presi-
dent’s  fiscal  year  2008  (FY  08)  budget  request  for  research  and  development  at  the
Department  of  Homeland  Security.  Agency  officials  and  outside  observers  will  com-
ment on budget priorities within the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) and
the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO).
2. Witnesses

3. Brief Overview

• The  FY  2008  budget  request  for  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s
Science  and  Technology  Directorate  (S&T)  is  $799.1  million.  This  is  a  $90.1
million (9.5 percent) decrease from the FY 2007 enacted funding.

• The  FY  2008  budget  request  for  the  Domestic  Nuclear  Detection  Office
(DNDO) is $569.1 million. This is an $80.9 million (17 percent) increase over
the FY 2007 enacted funding. The bulk of the increase is for research, devel-
opment, operations and systems acquisition.

• The  S&T  Directorate  was  reorganized  into  discipline-oriented  divisions  in
mid-2006.  While  the  FY  2008  budget  request  clarifies  priorities  among  dis-
ciplines, there remains a question of whether DHS’ R&D portfolio is properly
balanced. The bulk of R&D funding goes towards biological and nuclear detec-
tion  research.  It  is  unclear  if  these  priorities  are  in  response  to  recognized
risks or based on a completed risk assessment.

• There  is  a  problematic  lack  of  balance  between  basic  and  applied  research
and development. DHS dedicates the majority (52 percent) of its R&D funding
to ‘‘product transition’’ (short-term development), while allocating only 11 per-
cent  to  applied  research  and  13  percent  to  basic  research.  The  remainder
funds operational activities. De-emphasizing longer-term basic and applied re-
search may curtail the ability of DHS to react to emerging and future threats.

4. Background

Research  and  development  at  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  is  con-
centrated  in  the  Science  and  Technology  (S&T)  Directorate  and  Domestic  Nuclear
Detection  Office  (DNDO).  The  S&T  Directorate  has  responsibility  for  carrying  out
or  coordinating  nearly  all  federal  homeland  security  related  research.  DNDO  was
separated  from  S&T  in  2005  to  specifically  coordinate  all  research,  development,
and operations of technology to detect and report unauthorized transportation of nu-
clear and radiological materials.
S&T Directorate Organization

The  S&T  Directorate  was  reorganized  into  six  divisions  by  Under  Secretary  Jay
Cohen  in  mid-2006.  The  discipline-oriented  divisions  are  intended  to  reflect  specific
threats to public safety and critical infrastructure. They include:

• Chemical  and  Biological:  detection  and  mitigation  of  chemical  and  biological

weapons threats

• Explosives: detection of and response to conventional (non-nuclear) explosives
• Human  Factors:  social  science  research  to  improve  detection,  analysis,  and
understanding of threats posed by individuals as well as how communities re-
spond to disasters

• Infrastructure and Geophysical: identifies and mitigates threats to critical in-

frastructure

• Border  and  Maritime:  develops  technologies  for  surveillance  and  monitoring

of land and maritime borders

• Command,  Control,  and  Inter-operability:  research  and  development  support

for inter-operable communications and cyber security

In  addition  to  the  six  independent  divisions,  three  offices  coordinate  the  Direc-
torate’s R&D activities with extramural researchers and technology customers (typi-
cally  other  Directorates  of  DHS)  and  facilitate  technology  transfer.  As  part  of  the
extramural  research  portfolio,  the  S&T  Directorate  funds  the  University  Centers  of
Excellence program, which supports research across a broad variety of homeland se-
curity-related topics at university-based centers across the country.

DNDO Organization

DNDO  was  created  to  coordinate  federal  efforts  to  detect  and  respond  to  unau-
thorized  transportation  of  nuclear  or  radiological  materials  into  and  within  the
United States. DNDO, which reports directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security,
was transferred from the S&T Directorate in 2005. DNDO is responsible for coordi-
nation of federal agency efforts at DHS, the Department of Defense (DOD), the De-
partment of Energy (DOE), the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), the Nuclear
Regulatory  Commission  (NRC),  and  the  State  Department  to  prevent  the  transport
of  nuclear  and  radiological  materials  across  U.S.  borders.  It  also  works  with  inter-
national partners on detection and interdiction activities.

DNDO  is  responsible  for  research,  development,  testing  and  evaluation  of  detec-
tion  technologies;  acquisition  of  detection  technologies;  threat  assessments;  and
technical  support  and  training  for  State,  local,  and  Federal  Government  partners
and first responders. In 2006, DNDO completed a catalog of currently deployed glob-
al  nuclear  detection  assets  and  an  assessment  of  current  detection  capabilities,  in-
cluding an analysis of capability gaps across federal agencies.
5. FY 2008 Budget Request
S&T Directorate

In  FY  2008,  requested  funding  for  the  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  is  cut
by  $174M  or  17.8  percent  to  $799.1  million.  (TABLE  1)  As  in  previous  years,  the
request  is  strongly  weighted  towards  biological  and  chemical  countermeasures  re-
search. This division represents 29 percent of the overall Directorate budget. Other
priorities  include  research  into  explosives  detection  and  mitigation,  which  rep-
resents  eight  percent  of  the  overall  budget;  and  command,  control,  and  inter-oper-
ability, which also represents eight percent.

5

The  S&T  Directorate  also  categorizes  its  research  by  timeline,  defining  ‘‘product
transition’’  as  short-term  (0–3  years)  development;  innovative  capabilities  as  mid-
term  (2–5  years)  high-risk,  high-payoff  applied  research;  and  ‘‘basic  research’’  as
long-term (>8 years), high-risk fundamental science. The remainder of the portfolio,
including testing and standards, laboratory operations, and policy work is classified
as ‘‘other.’’ The FY 2008 budget strongly favors short-term development (TABLE 2),
with  just  over  10  percent  of  funding  dedicated  to  basic  research.  The  balance  of  re-
search  funding  is  overseen  by  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  Research,  which  is  also
responsible  for  integrating  internal  and  external  basic  research  into  DHS  missions
and S&T Directorate divisions.

Within  the  S&T  Directorate,  the  Administration  requests  reduced  funding  for
nearly  every  division,  with  the  only  increases  going  to  the  relatively  small  Human
Factors division and a nearly flat budget for the Command, Control, and Inter-oper-
ability  division.  Additionally,  funding  is  cut  significantly  for  University  programs.
A summary of some the major division and office budgets follows:

Innovation

A significant funding increase is provided to the Office of Innovation, which man-
ages  the  Homeland  Security  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency  (HSARPA)  grant
program.  However,  the  funding  increase  will  mainly  support  advanced  technology
development and demonstrations and does not provide funding for the basic and ap-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 Jun 11, 2007 Jkt 033611 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\T&I07\030807\33611 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

6

plied  research  priorities  included  in  HSARPA’s  mandate.  Additionally,  $7.5  million
of  the  total  $59.9  million  is  budgeted  for  the  Scalable  Composite  Vessel  Prototype,
a project to develop an improved hull for Coast Guard skippers.

Chemical and Biological

Funding  for  R&D  in  this  division  stayed  flat,  but  $84.1M  in  funding  was  trans-
ferred to the new Office of Health Affairs for the operational (non-R&D) components
of three programs (BioWatch, the Biological Warning and Incident Characterization
(BWIC)  system,  and  the  Rapidly  Deployable  Chemical  Detection  System)  which
monitor  for  releases  of  biological  or  chemical  weapons.  The  remaining  budget  will
support  R&D  for  the  next  generation  of  BioWatch,  which  is  a  monitoring  program
for detecting release of biohazards. This division represents by far the largest budg-
et priority in the S&T Directorate.

Command, Control, and Inter-operability (C2I)

Funding  for  C2I  stayed  relatively  flat  from  FY  2007,  but  follows  a  41  percent  re-
duction from FY 2006. This division covers research into cyber security, communica-
tions  inter-operability,  surveillance  and  investigative  technologies,  and  threat  as-
sessment.  In  FY  2007,  funding  was  cut  for  the  emergent  and  prototypical  tech-
nologies  and  rapid  prototyping  portfolios  in  this  division,  which  limited  the  DHS’
ability  to  address  threats  outside  the  existing  divisions,  perform  basic  research  to
identify  vulnerabilities  and  countermeasures,  and  quickly  address  DHS-specific  re-
quirements for technologies.

Explosives

Funding for the explosives portfolio is reduced by $41.5 million or 40 percent from
FY  2007  to  $63.7  million.  A  portion  of  this  reduction  in  funding  is  a  result  of  the
completion  of  the  Counter-MANPADS  program,  which  developed  an  airplane  based
defense  against  shoulder-fired  missiles.  If  the  Counter-MANPADS  program  is  not
considered  in  the  budget  calculation,  the  total  funding  for  explosives  counter-
measures  is  decreased  from  $86.6M  to  $63.7M,  a  reduction  of  $22.9  million  or  26.4
percent.

Testing, Evaluation, and Standards

The  requested  funding  for  this  division  is  $25.5  million,  which  is  relatively  flat
compared  to  FY  2007.  This  division  is  responsible  for  activities  that  include  coordi-
nating the development of metrics for equipment performance and certification, pro-
tocols for testing and training, and evaluation of equipment.

University Programs

Funding for University Programs is reduced by $9.9 million (20 percent) from FY
2007  to  $38.7  million.  The  S&T  Directorate  plans  to  establish  four  new  University
Centers of Excellence—in spite of the reduced funding—and improve the capabilities
of Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to conduct research in homeland security re-
lated areas and incorporate MSIs into the University Centers program.
DNDO

In  FY  2008,  the  Administration  requests  $561.9  million  for  DNDO  (TABLE  3).
This  request  increases  total  funding  for  the  Office  by  $80.9  million  or  17  percent.
The budget is increased for every component of DNDO, with the bulk of the increase
going towards Research, Development, and Operations and Systems Acquisition.

A summary of the major categories follows:

7

Management and Administration

The  $3.5  million  increase  for  Management  and  Administration  provides  reim-
bursement  to  other  federal  agencies  providing  staff  members  to  DNDO  as  detailees
and goes toward creating additional full-time positions. Many of these staff support
research, development, and operations activities and aviation and maritime security
activities.  A  larger  full-time,  non-detailee  staff  will  improve  DNDO’s  ability  to  con-
duct testing and evaluation and support improved acquisition protocols that will re-
sult in use of better detection technology.

Research, Development, and Operations (RD&O)

Research,  development,  and  operations  (RD&O)  activities  within  DNDO  include
engineering and architecture for detection systems, high-risk transformational R&D,
technology  assessments,  operations  support  for  government  partners,  and  the  Na-
tional  Technical  Nuclear  Forensics  Center.  Together,  these  components  aim  to  sup-
port a seamless system of nuclear detection from basic research through technology
development  and  implementation.  The  requested  funding  increase  of  $47.4  million
or  17  percent  will  go  primarily  to  transformational  research  and  development  (up
$22.9 million or 30 percent).

Within the transformational R&D portfolio, the FY 2008 priority will be the initi-
ation  of  several  Advanced  Technology  Demonstrations  (ATDs).  For  example,  one  of
the  ATDs  will  focus  on  radioactive  material  detection  in  various  transit  systems
such  as  ship  or  airplane  transit.  Other  priorities  will  be  port  security,  training  for
State and local law enforcement, and assessing hand-held detection technologies.

Systems Acquisition

The  budget  request  for  systems  acquisition  activities  of  $208  million  includes
funding for deploying radiation monitors at ports of entry and the Securing the Cit-
ies  Initiative,  which  is  a  program  to  deploy  nuclear  detection  equipment  at
entryways  into  a  city,  including  ports,  highways,  and  airports.  New  York  City  was
the  pilot  city  in  2006,  and  the  Administration  requests  funding  in  FY  2008  to  ex-
pand  the  program.  The  requested  $30  million  (17  percent)  increase  in  funding  for
Systems  Acquisition  will  go  entirely  toward  this  second  phase  of  the  Securing  the
Cities Initiative.

6. Issues and Concerns
How  does  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  use  risk  assessments  to
determine R&D priorities? The budget request for R&D at DHS raises a number
of  concerns,  some  of  which  are  ongoing  from  the  inception  of  the  Department.  The
Department’s  mission  is  to  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  the  United  States  to—and
mitigate  the  effects  of—threats,  both  manmade  and  natural,  but  the  overall  jus-
tification  of  the  DHS  R&D  portfolio  makes  no  indication  that  there  was  any  threat
used  to  inform  how  research  areas  were  prioritized.  The  S&T  Directorate  plans  to
issue  a  five-year  strategic  plan  in  April  2007  that  will  include  some  input  from  the
Homeland  Security  Institute,  a  policy  advisory  board,  on  risk.  The  lack  of  invest-
ment  in  risk  assessment  is  wasteful  at  best  and  potentially  dangerous,  as  there  is
no  basis  for  prioritizing  unexpectedly  urgent  threats.  In  one  example  cited  by  the
Under Secretary, following the liquid explosives threat to airplanes in August 2006,
it  took  the  S&T  Directorate  two  months  to  set  up  a  research  program  to  evaluate
the risks of and countermeasures against liquid explosives. This delay hampered the
ability of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to develop guidelines for
transporting  liquids  on  planes,  causing  countless  delays  and  problems  for  travelers
and airlines.
Is the balance between short- and long-term research at DHS appropriate?
What  criteria  does  DHS  use  to  determine  the  balance  between  long-  and
short-term research? While the requested funding for basic research within DHS
S&T has more than doubled from FY 2007 to approximately 13 percent in FY 2008,
the Department’s R&D portfolio remains strongly weighted towards end-stage tech-
nology  development  with  funding  for  basic  research  well  below  the  Under  Sec-
retary’s  goal  of  20  percent  of  all  research  dollars.  Likewise,  DNDO  does  not  give
adequate  priority  to  basic  research,  requesting  $100  million  for  transformational
R&D but only directing 11 percent ($11.1 million) of that funding to basic research.
The remainder funds technology development.

The  large  proposed  cuts  to  the  University  Centers  of  Excellence  program  further
reduce  investment  in  basic  research.  Funding  for  emergent  and  prototypical  tech-
nologies, cut significantly in FY 2007, also remains low. Emphasizing short-term re-
search makes the Department significantly less agile and responsive, locking it into
a single technological response to emerging and future threats.

How do DHS R&D priorities reflect the needs of customers, including other
Directorates within DHS, interagency partners, and State and local govern-
ments? Under Secretary Cohen has said that the research priorities of the S&T Di-
rectorate  should  directly  serve  ‘‘customers’’—defined  as  users  of  DHS’  research  re-
sults  and  developed  technologies.  To  that  effect,  the  Under  Secretary  established
‘‘integrated  product  teams’’  comprised  of  officials  from  other  DHS  components  who
advise  the  S&T  Directorate  on  their  technology  needs,  thus  informing  specific  re-
search  priorities.  While  these  interdisciplinary  teams  are  a  step  in  the  right  direc-
tion,  the  Department  needs  a  much  stronger  focus  on  integrating  the  opinions  of
interagency and outside partners. At least 10 agencies, including the National Insti-
tute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST),  the  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF),
the  Department  of  Transportation  (DOT)  and  others  perform  homeland  security-re-
lated  R&D.  However,  there  is  no  formal  mechanism  for  leveraging  the  R&D  work
of other agencies within DHS. Both the S&T Directorate and DNDO have been criti-
cized for ignoring the work and advice of other federal agencies. Similarly, State and
local  officials,  including  first  responders,  have  complained  that  DHS  is  not  respon-
sive to their requests and recommendations related to technology development. The
Department  must  development  a  formal  mechanism  for  responding  to  the  final
users of the R&D it supports.

Chairman  WU.  I  would  like  to  call  the  Subcommittee  to  order.
We want to welcome everyone to this morning’s hearing on the fis-
cal  year  2008  Research  and  Development  budget  for  the  Depart-
ment  of  Homeland  Security.  I  want  to  offer  a  special  welcome  to
Under  Secretary  Jay  Cohen,  who  joined  the  Department  of  Home-
land  Security’s  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  in  August,
2006.  Your  reputation  as  a  problem-solver  precedes  you  from  the
Office of Naval Research.

I also want to welcome our other witnesses, who represent a val-
uable  pool  of  expertise  across  Homeland  Security  related  topics.
Mr.  Vayl  Oxford  is  the  Director  of  the  Domestic  Nuclear  Detection
Office  at  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security.  Prior  to  his  ap-
pointment at DNDO, Mr. Oxford served as the Director for Counter
Proliferation at the National Security Council.

Dr. Gerald Epstein is a senior fellow for Science and Security for
Homeland  Security  at  the  Center  for  Strategic  and  International
Studies.  He  has  served  at  the  Institute  for  Defense  Analysis  and
with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.

Mr.  Jonah  Czerwinski  is  a  senior  fellow  for  Homeland  Security
with IBM’s Global Leadership Initiative. He is also a senior advisor
for  Homeland  Security  projects  at  the  Center  for  the  Study  of  the
Presidency.

Ms. Marilyn Ward is the Executive Director of the National Pub-
lic Safety Telecommunications Council; Representative Gingrey will
tell us a little more about her background in a moment.

We  look  forward  to  hearing  your  thoughts  on  how  to  support  a
world  class  R&D  enterprise  at  the  Department  of  Homeland  Secu-
rity that keeps our communities safe.

When the Science Committee helped write the legislation author-
izing  the  R&D  Programs  at  DHS,  we  envisioned  an  organization
that  would  support  the  Science  and  Technology  needs  of  people  on
the  front  lines  of  domestic  security;  from  first  responders  to  com-
puter  security  professionals,  from  medical  workers  to  civil  engi-
neers.  Frankly,  it  has  been  a  bit  of  a  rough  start.  We  are  familiar
with management problems that have caused a lack of focus on im-
portant  R&D  priorities  and  the  attrition  of  some  of  the  best  and
brightest minds from the S&T Directorate.

I have also heard some concerns from communities and cities and
users  of  some  of  the  DHS  technology,  which  feel  that  DHS  R&D
Programs at the S&T Directorate and at DNDO have not been en-
tirely responsive to their needs.

But  I  do  remain  hopeful.  Under  Secretary  Cohen  has  launched
an ambitious new management structure to insure a more cohesive
S&T  Directorate.  Hopefully  the  R&D  results  will  flow  smoothly
from  the  earliest  research  concepts  to  the  most  advanced  tech-
nology development. Only time will tell.

Under  Secretary  Cohen  has  admirably  acknowledged  the  prob-
lems  within  the  S&T  Directorate  which  is  the  first  step  in  formu-
lating  solutions.  This  committee  stands  ready  to  work  with  all  of
you and your staffs to insure that we have a strong and responsive
research operation at DHS.

I am concerned, though, about the lack of a strategic plan based
on  risk  assessment  that  should  be  the  basis  for  research  priorities
within  DHS.  We  can  fund  billions  of  dollars  in  research,  but  if  we

don’t  pay  attention  to  the  risks  we  should  be  addressing,  we  won’t
have  the  answers  we  need  when  we  need  them.  We  can  base  re-
search  on  anecdotal  impressions  of  need,  but  that  is  not  the  sci-
entific  approach  that  the  American  people  have  a  right  to  expect.
I  strongly  encourage  you  to  carry  out  a  detailed,  systematic,  sci-
entific  risk  assessment  soon  so  that  we  know  whether  our  invest-
ments  are  in  the  right  place.  Nuclear  threats  will  obviously  be  a
major  part  of  any  threat  assessment.  I  am  especially  eager  to  see
signs  of  close  cooperation  between  the  S&T  Directorate  and  the
DNDO.  It  is  imperative  that  you  all  take  advantage  of  the  com-
plementary efforts of your offices and avoid duplication.

I  am  committed  to  working  with  the  Department  to  insure  that
our  R&D  efforts  there  are  successful  in  increasing  our  knowledge
of  how  to  confront  catastrophes,  whether  from  human  or  nature
causes.

I look forward to hearing all of the witnesses’ thoughts on the fis-
cal year 2008 budget request and how that budget supports science
and technology to make our nation safer.

I  now  want  to  recognize  my  colleague  and  the  Ranking  Member

from Georgia, Dr. Gingrey, for his opening remarks.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN DAVID WU

I would like to call the Subcommittee to order.
I  want  to  welcome  everyone  to  this  morning’s  hearing  on  the  FY08  research  and
development budget for the Department of Homeland Security. I want to offer a spe-

We  look  forward  to  hearing  your  thoughts  on  how  to  support  a  world-class  R&D
enterprise  at  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  that  helps  keep  our  commu-
nities safe.

When  the  Science  Committee  helped  write  the  legislation  authorizing  the  R&D
programs  at  DHS,  we  envisioned  an  organization  that  would  support  the  science
and  technology  needs  of  people  on  the  front  lines  of  domestic  security—from  first
responders  to  computer  security  professionals,  from  medical  workers  to  civil  engi-
neers.  Frankly,  it’s  been  a  rough  start.  We’re  familiar  with  management  problems
that  have  caused  a  lack  of  focus  on  important  R&D  priorities  and  the  attrition  of
the  best  and  the  brightest  minds  from  the  S&T  Directorate.  I’ve  also  heard  from
communities and cities which feel that DHS R&D programs at the S&T Directorate
and  the  Domestic  Nuclear  Detection  Office  (DNDO)  have  not  been  entirely  respon-
sive to their needs.

But  I  remain  hopeful.  Under  Secretary  Cohen  has  launched  an  ambitious  new
management  structure  to  ensure  a  more  cohesive  S&T  Directorate.  Hopefully,  the
R&D  results  will  flow  smoothly  from  the  earliest  research  concepts  to  the  most  ad-

lution.  This  committee  stands  ready  to  work  with  Under  Secretary  Cohen  and  all
of his staff to ensure that we have a strong and responsive S&T Directorate.

I am concerned though about the lack of a strategic plan or risk assessment that
should be the basis for research priorities within the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity. We can fund billions of dollars in research, but if we don’t pay attention to the
risks  we  should  be  addressing,  we  won’t  have  the  answers  we  need  when  we  need
them.  We  can  base  research  on  anecdotal  impressions  of  need,  but  that  is  not  the
scientific  approach  that  the  American  people  have  a  right  to  expect.  I  strongly  en-
courage you to carry out a detailed, scientific risk assessment soon, so that we know
whether  our  investments  are  in  the  right  place.  Nuclear  threats  will  obviously  be
a  major  part  of  any  threat  assessment.  I  am  especially  eager  to  see  signs  of  close
cooperation between the S&T Directorate and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. It
is  imperative  that  you  take  advantage  of  the  complementary  efforts  of  your  offices
and avoid duplication.

I am committed to working with the Department of Homeland Security to ensure
that R&D investments are successful in increasing our knowledge of how to confront
catastrophes,  whether  from  human  or  natural  causes.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  all
of  the  witnesses’  thoughts  on  the  FY08  budget  request  and  how  that  budget  sup-
ports science and technology to make our nation safer.

I now want to recognize my colleague and the Ranking Member from Georgia, Dr.

Gingrey, for his opening remarks.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  and  in  the  interest  of
full disclosure I want to say that I do know Dan Quayle, and I am
a  lot  like  him.  I  can’t  spell  tomato  or  potato,  and  I  don’t  know  if
I could give the best impersonation of him like my colleague did of
President Clinton, but if I stumble, forgive me. It is my staff. They
gave  me  remarks  that  are  written  in  very  small  type,  and  I  will
talk to them about that later.

Great  to  be  with  my  Chairman  this  morning  at  this  important
hearing.  I  want  to  thank  him  for  holding  the  hearing  on  science
and  technology  developments  at  the  Department  of  Homeland  Se-
curity,  and  also  a  special  thank  you  to  our  esteemed  panel  of  wit-
nesses, taking time to dialogue with us about the role that science
and technology is playing in securing our nation.

Mr. Chairman, I strongly believe our nation’s scientific enterprise
remains a critical component of national security. The efforts of the
Science  and  Technology  Directorate  and  the  Domestic  Nuclear  De-
tection  Office  contribute  to  the  preparedness  of  our  nation  against
terrorism  and  nuclear  disasters.  These  organizations  tap  into  the
limitless creativity of our nation’s scientists and engineers to bring
cutting-edge technology to those defending our nation, from service-
men and women to border patrol agents and first responders.

I am particularly pleased to welcome Under Secretary Cohen and
Mr.  Vayl  Oxford  to  this  subcommittee  hearing.  Gentlemen,  your
service  to  our  great  nation  is  greatly  appreciated.  I  very  much  en-
joyed meeting both of you earlier this week. That was my pleasure,
and  I  look  forward  to  continuing  the  conversations  we  started  in
regards to the exciting opportunities that scientific research is pro-
viding  to  securing  our  homeland.  This  committee  is  committed  to
supporting  your  work  and  helping  you  create  both  a  balanced  and
innovative research portfolio.

And  I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  Ms.  Marilyn
Ward  for  joining  us  today  to  take  part  in  this  discussion.  Ms.
Ward’s  organization,  the  National  Public  Safety  Telecommuni-
cations  Council,  includes  representatives  from  many  different  first
responder  communities.  Such  representatives  include  the  Inter-
national  Association  of  Chiefs  of  Police,  emergency  managers,  as
well  as  fire  chiefs.  Ms.  Ward,  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  you

on  how  the  Department’s  research  and  the  development  activities
can further support our nation’s first responders.

In particular, your appearance will allow us to examine one high-
ly-influential  program  in  the  Science  and  Technology  Directorate,
and  that  is  the  Office  for  Inter-operable  Communications,  and  I
know you will tell us about that. This office has worked for the last
several years with first responders to improve the inter-operability
of communication equipment, and that work continues today in co-
operation with the new Office of Emergency Communications with-
in DHS Preparedness Directorate.

I am eager to not only hear from our witnesses how Science and
Technology  efforts  save  or  are  yielding  immediate  benefits  to  the
defense  of  our  nation  but  also  ways  we  can  improve  upon  your  ef-
forts.  The  President  has  requested  over  $1.3  billion  in  funding  for
the  two  organizations  before  us  today  for  this  next  ’08  fiscal  year.
How  that  funding  is  allocated  across  the  various  programs  and
projects  in  your  organization  no  doubt  is  a  difficult  task,  consid-
ering  the  reality  of  the  world  that  we  now  live  in.  Whether  the
greatest threat to our country is a radiologic device coming through
our ports or an infectious disease outbreak or a cyber attack on our
nation’s financial infrastructure, the fundamental challenges before
us  how  to  best  distribute  the  limited  funding  in  the  face  of  these
highly-uncertain and varied threats.

In  addition  to  prioritizing  these  various  threats  our  country  now
faces,  we  must  also  consider  the  nature  of  research  performed  to
combat  them.  Do  we  focus  federal  spending  towards  long-term
basic  research?  What  percentage  of  the  funding  do  we  allocate  to-
wards  incremental  improvements  to  our  current  capabilities?  With
these  overarching  questions  in  mind,  I  look  forward  to  delving
more  deeply  into  the  activities  of  Science  and  Technology  Direc-
torate and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office.

I once again thank all of the witnesses for taking the time to be
here  with  us  today.  I  anticipate  this  hearing  will  yield  a  fruitful
and productive conversation. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to hear-
ing from them and continuing to work with you on this very impor-
tant  subcommittee,  and  with  that  I  will  yield  back  to  the  Chair-
man.

novative research portfolio.

I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  Ms.  Marilyn  Ward  for  joining  us

I am eager to not only hear from our witnesses how science and technology efforts
are  yielding  immediate  benefits  to  the  defense  of  our  nation,  but  also  ways  we  can
improve upon these efforts.

The President has requested over $1.3 billion dollars in funding for the two orga-
nizations  before  us  today  for  fiscal  year  2008.  How  that  funding  is  allocated  across
the  various  programs  and  projects  in  your  organizations,  I  have  no  doubt,  is  a  dif-
ficult task considering the reality of the world we now live in. Whether the greatest
threat to our country is a radiological device coming through our ports, or an infec-
tious disease outbreak, or a cyber attack on our nation’s financial infrastructure; the
fundamental challenge before us is how to best distribute limited funding in the face

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Gingrey.  Other  Members  who
wish to submit opening statements, the opening statements will be
added to the record.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Mitchell follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE HARRY E. MITCHELL

Thank you Mr. Chairman.
As  you  know,  we  have  a  problem  in  Arizona.  Our  border  is  broken  and  the  Fed-
eral  Government  is  failing  to  fix  it.  The  border  is  porous,  and  monitoring  is  inad-
equate.  We  have  deployed  systems  and  technology  to  help,  but  not  nearly  enough
to stem the flow of illegal immigrants, drugs and threats of terrorism.

We  should  be  investing  in  border-related  research  and  development,  but  unfortu-

nately, the budget proposal before us today, seeks cuts.

This just doesn’t make any sense. Not for Arizona, and not for our country.
Budgeting is about priorities, and I believe our priorities should be based on solid

risk assessment. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like today’s proposal does that.

Clearly biological and nuclear threats deserve our attention, but so do University
Centers  for  Excellence  and  much  of  the  long-term  research  and  development  that
our Federal Government undertakes to protect us from future risks. Not to mention
the border.

I look forward today’s testimony.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman  WU.  And  I  now  turn  to  our  witnesses.  As  each  of  you
all  already  know,  please  try  to  keep  your  testimony  to  within  ap-
proximately five minutes or so, summarizing your substantial writ-
ten  testimony.  And  after  your  testimony  the  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee will have a rotating period of five minutes each to ask ques-
tions. And we will start with Under Secretary Cohen.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  JAY  M.  COHEN,  UNDER  SECRETARY  OF
SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY,  DEPARTMENT  OF  HOMELAND
SECURITY
Mr.  COHEN.  Good  morning,  Chairman  Wu,  Congressman
Gingrey,  and  Congressman  Bonner.  I  can  tell  you  it  is  a  personal
honor  to  appear  before  the  distinguished  Science  Committee,  and
I  have  had  the  opportunity  to  testify  in  the  past.  I  note  that  both
the  chairman  and  the  Ranking  Member  went  to  medical  school,  so
you will appreciate I may limit my comments here.

Chairman WU. One of us finished, one of us didn’t. Since his title

is doctor, you can take your guess.

Mr. COHEN. Well, I won’t venture——
Chairman  WU.  The  one  that  didn’t  finish  went  on  to  become  a

rich man.

Mr. COHEN. Yes, sir.
Chairman WU. And the other one is struggling.
Mr.  COHEN.  I  won’t  venture  to  guess  who  is  smarter.  And  I  am
also humbled to be sitting in a panel with such distinguished indi-
viduals  as  are  sitting  before  you.  But  I  am  here  to  update  you  on
the  progress  that  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  Science
and  Technology  Directorate  has  made  and  discuss  the  President’s
budget  request  for  fiscal  year  2008,  and  how  I  believe  it  will  posi-
tion  us  to  develop  and  transition  technology  to  protect  the  Nation
from  catastrophic  events  as  the  Congress  and  the  Administration
wisely envisioned in the 19 pages of enabling legislation for the De-
partment of Homeland Security.

As  the  Chairman  has  already  indicated,  my  directorate  is  com-
mitted to serving our customers. Those are the 22 DHS components
and  their  customers,  the  customers  of  my  customers,  our  heroes,
the  first  responders,  the  police,  fire,  and  EMT.  But  the  customers
as customers are greater than that. For the Coast Guard, they are
the  guardsmen  who  sail  in  harm’s  way,  for  the  Border  Patrol,  the
agents  who  man  the  border,  and  for  the  TSA,  the  screeners.  They
are  the  hardworking  men  and  women  on  the  front  lines  of  Home-
land Security, and they appreciate your support, and in prior testi-
mony  I  commented  on  Chairman  Bennie  Thompson’s  very  kind  e-
mail  to  those  many  hardworking  people,  appreciating  what  they
have done.

I  greatly  appreciate  the  support  and  the  leadership  of  the  Con-
gress.  Last  year  you  took  a  very  hard  and  strong  decision  in  Sep-
tember to restore the fiscal year 2007 funding. That has been enor-
mously helpful to me in kick starting the directorate to achieve the
results  that  we  all  desire,  and  I  am  especially  grateful  of  that  in
what I know is a difficult election year. So thank you so much.

And  I  also  want  to  thank  the  staff,  special  staff  of  the  Science
and  Technology  Committee,  but  all  the  staffs  of  the  committees
that  I  work  with  who  have  worked  with  me,  have  tried  to  educate
me,  and  it  is  a  very  professional  relationship.  And  I  congratulate
you both on the selection of the new staff for the Science and Tech-
nology Committee.

As  you  are  aware,  the  focus  of  my  first  months  on  the  job  have
been laying the foundation to align the directorate for success, and
that was to excel in four key areas, and I shared this with you last
September  when  I  testified  previously.  It  was  to  get  the  organiza-

tion,  the  people,  the  books,  and  the  content  of  the  program  right.
Those  were  my  four  gets.  But  they  were  focused  on  the  threats  as
you  mentioned,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  the  threats  as  I  defined  them
simplistically were bombs, borders, bugs, and business. And bombs,
borders,  and  bugs  we  can  all  feel,  we  can  all  sense.  They  are  tan-
gible,  but  the  business  is  really  about  the  cyber  backbone  that  en-
ables this incredible technology-focused economy that we have. And
if  the  bad  guys  that  you  have  mentioned  can  take  that  away  from
us,  we  will  have  as  much  panic  as  I  believe  we  would  from  a  nu-
clear device.

I believe the record will show that we made good progress in my
first  six  months  on  the  job  in  all  of  these  areas  and  just  to  give  a
quick highlight, we have, in fact, with the approval of the Congress
and Secretary Chertoff in the first month realigned the directorate.
I  have  a  strong  leadership  team  in  place  where  all  the  key  posi-
tions are filled. We have welcomed over 20 new highly-qualified sci-
entists  and  engineers,  subject-matter  experts,  and  professionals
into  the  directorate,  and  four  Government  Service  personnel  who
left  the  directorate  last  spring  have  asked  to  come  back  and  are
now back on board, and welcome them and the continuity that they
bring.

I  am  basically  two-thirds  manned  of  where  I  need  to  be  by  the
end  of  this  fiscal  year  and  we  are  making  very  good  progress.  I
have  no  shortage  of  volunteers.  Even  some  who  want  to  work  pro
bono I am trying to figure out how I do that.

The  six  technical  divisions  are  all  led  by  veteran  S&T  members.
My three research investment portfolio directors for research, basic
research,  transition,  and  innovation,  my  high  risk,  provide  the
crosscutting coordination amongst those six divisions so I don’t end
up with stovepipes.

And  finally,  those  divisions  are  focused  on  what  I  believe  you
have  mandated  and  the  public  expects  are  the  high  priority  issues
of  explosives,  things  that  go  bang,  of  the  nuclear  radiological,  that
is  Mr.  Oxford,  but  we  work  closely  together,  chem  bio,  half  of  my
budget,  and  it  is  a  threat  which  I  believe  the  other  witnesses  will
indicate  is  as  significant  as  the  nuclear  radiological  threat  in  to-
day’s  world.  Command,  control,  and  inter-operability,  and  I  know
you  will  ask  more  about  that.  Borders  and  maritime.  I  initially
thought  about  that  as  two  divisions,  but  our  borders  on  the  west
coast  are  sea  on  the  north  land,  sea  on  the  southeastern  land  and
the southwest, 48,000 border patrol, 40,000 Coast Guardsman. The
synergies there are impressive. It is one division, but the comment
of  the  Coast  Guard  has  detailed  an  active  duty  Coast  Guard  cap-
tain  to  be  my  deputy  director  so  we  are  seamless.  And  at  the  end
of  the  day  the  more  we  can  do  to  remove  seams,  the  safer  we  will
be against a terrorist.

We  have  established  a  division  of  human  factors.  Dow  Chemical
has  a  wonderful  commercial  today  about  the  human  element.  It  is
hostile  intent,  the  psychology  of  terrorism.  These  may  be  the  light
sciences, but they are critically important if we are going to defend
the  country.  I  came  on  board  on  the  10th  of  August.  That  was  the
day of the liquid explosives plot in England. The Brits did it right.
They got the bomber. You get the bomber, you don’t have to worry
about  the  bomb,  but  regrettably,  there  may  always  be  leakage,  so

16

we  do  worry  about  the  bomb.  But  human  factors,  like  command,
control, and inter-operability, crosscut.

And  finally,  infrastructure  protection  and  geophysical  sciences.  I
am  responsible,  as  you  have  noted,  for  all  hazards,  not  just  man-
made. And so tsunamis, hurricanes, fire, flooding, earthquakes, we
have got to do a better job of protecting against those.

Now,  there  is  much  more  I  could  say,  but  I  will  reserve  that  for
the  question  and  answer  period.  I  did  want  to  note  a  statement
that  I  have  been  making.  Chairman  Wu,  I  know  I  finally  arrived
because  I  am  in  a  blog  now,  last  Friday,  when  I  said  that  we  are
in  crisis  in  science  and  technology.  In  the  middle  schools,  kids  are
turning  away  from  math  and  science.  You  know  this  better  than
I  do.  And  Congressman  Bonner,  I  was  so  pleased  to  see  Governor
Riley’s  State  of  State  Address,  where  he  devoted  nearly  half  of  his
message, and we are seeing that in so many states; Kentucky, and
there were hearings yesterday on the Hill. But we are in crisis, and
if  we  don’t  get  the  kids  to  take  the  hard  subjects  of  science  and
math,  we  will  not  enjoy  the  economic  society,  the  technological
dominance  that  we  have  enjoyed  for  so  long.  And  so  I  compared  it
to  the  Play  Station  society  or  the  Play  Station  generation,  and
some  people  viewed  that  as  derogatory,  but  I  stand  by  those  re-
marks.  And  we  want  instant  gratification,  but  science  and  tech-
nology require much more.

So we are moving forward on Centers of Excellence. We currently
have seven. We are realigning them to be in line with my divisions.
We have broad agency announcements out for an additional four to
meet  the  needs  that  we  weren’t  meeting,  and  I  am  allotting  my
very robust thanks to you, Scholarship and Fellowship Program, to
those  Centers  of  Excellence,  which  currently  include  over  80  uni-
versities  and  colleges  in  the  states  but  shortly  will  include  more
than  100.  This  is  exciting.  The  S&T  Directorate  appreciates  the
many  demands  on  the  taxpayers’  precious  dollars.  We  are  com-
mitted to being wise stewards of those public monies that you have
and  will  entrust  to  us.  I  appreciate  the  Science  and  Technology
Committee’s support. I welcome your oversight, and I will be happy
to take your questions. Thank you so much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JAY M. COHEN

INTRODUCTION

Good Morning Chairman Wu, Ranking Member Gingrey, and distinguished Mem-
bers  of  the  Subcommittee.  It  is  an  honor  to  appear  before  you  today  to  update  you
on  the  progress  of  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s  (DHS)  realigned  Science
and Technology Directorate (S&T Directorate) and discuss how the Directorate’s pri-
orities  in  the  President’s  Budget  Request  for  Fiscal  Year  2008  will  position  us  to
develop and transition technology to protect the Nation from catastrophic events.

The S&T Directorate is committed to serving our customers, the components that
comprise  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security—and  their  customers—the  hard-
working men and women on the front lines of homeland security, especially the first
responders,  who  need  ready  access  to  technology  and  information  to  perform  their
jobs  more  efficiently  and  safely.  I  am  honored  and  privileged  to  serve  with  the  tal-
ented  scientists,  engineers  and  other  professionals  who  support  these  dedicated
Americans  in  our  shared  mission  to  secure  our  homeland  and  defend  our  freedoms.
First  and  foremost,  I  am  very  appreciative  of  the  leadership  of  the  Congress  in
its  support  of  the  S&T  Directorate,  and  of  me  personally,  as  I  assumed  the  role  of
Under  Secretary  for  Science  and  Technology  last  August.  The  informed  counsel  of
Committee Members with homeland security oversight, and that of their staffs, has

17

been invaluable to my efforts to position the S&T Directorate for accountability, tan-
gible results and success, both for today and in the future.

Also,  thank  you  for  your  vote  of  confidence  in  the  Directorate,  evidenced  by  the
decision  to  appropriate  $848  million  in  FY  2007.  This  has  been  enormously  helpful
in my efforts to better align people with our mission to develop a robust science and
technology  capability  to  protect  the  Nation  as  Congress  envisioned  in  the  enabling
legislation for the Department. We look forward to working with the 110th Congress
in a bipartisan and non-partisan manner to use science to better secure the Nation.
I am also grateful for the leadership of the President and Homeland Security Sec-
retary Michael Chertoff and for the vision and guidance that the Secretary and Dep-
uty Secretary Michael Jackson have contributed to the realignment process.
THE FIRST 180 DAYS—ALIGNED AND OPEN FOR BUSINESS

My first six months on the job have been focused on laying the foundation in orga-
nization,  people,  and  processes  to  enable  the  Directorate  to  skillfully  apply  the  re-
sources  you  have  wisely  provided  in  ways  that  best  serve  the  American  people  and
better secure our homeland. I am pleased to report that we are ‘‘open for business,’’
and  your  support  of  the  President’s  FY  2008  Budget  Request  will  allow  us  to  build
upon that momentum.

As I’ve said on many occasions, the S&T Directorate must excel in four key areas
if  we  are  to  accomplish  these  goals:  We  must  get  the  organization,  the  people,  the
books, and the program content right. These four ‘‘gets’’ are the cornerstones of the
realignment  effort  and  we’ve  made  significant  progress  in  each  of  these  areas.  In
addition  to  the  four  gets,  the  four  Bs—bombs,  borders,  bugs  and  business—provide
the  thematic  approach  to  help  keep  us  focused  on  the  priority  areas  for  the  S&T
Directorate.

I  have  realigned  the  S&T  Directorate  to  help  it  fulfill  its  potential  of  becoming
the  customer-focused,  output-oriented,  science  and  technology  management  organi-
zation  that  Congress  intended  it  to  be  and  the  Nation  deserves.  I  thank  Congress
for  its  support  of  the  new  organizational  structure  that,  in  turn,  is  supportive  of  a
broad  and  balanced  range  of  activities  that  are  aimed  at  identifying,  enabling  and
transitioning  new  capabilities  to  our  customers  to  better  protect  the  Nation.  We
have  organized  our  program  management  into  six  technical  divisions  that  are  led
by  veteran  S&T  Directorate  staff  members  and  linked  to  three  research  and  devel-
opment  investment  portfolio  directors  in  a  ‘‘matrix  management’’  structure.  The
technical  divisions  are  focused  on  enduring  homeland  security  disciplines  of  Explo-
sives;  Chemical  and  Biological;  Command,  Control  &  Inter-operability;  Borders  and
Maritime  Security;  Human  Factors;  and  Infrastructure  Protection  and  Geophysical
Sciences.  The  effort  to  combat  the  threat  posed  by  nuclear  or  radiological  weapons
is  primarily  led  by  the  Domestic  Nuclear  Detection  Office.  The  portfolio  directors—
Director  of  Research,  Director  of  Transition,  and  Director  of  Innovation/Homeland
Security  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency  (HSARPA)—provide  cross-cutting  co-
ordination of their respective aspects of the investment strategy within the technical
divisions.

I  am  pleased  to  report  that  today  the  S&T  Directorate  has  a  strong  leadership
team in place with all key positions filled. Since August, we have also welcomed 20
new  highly  qualified  subject  matter  experts  and  professionals  to  the  S&T  Direc-
torate,  including  three  former  DHS  S&T  employees  who  had  previously  left  the  Di-
rectorate  and  who  have  returned.  Overall,  we  are  66  percent  staffed  and  plan  to
have 100 percent of staff in place by the end of 2007.

I  have  made  significant  strides  in  ‘‘getting  the  books  right’’  by  holding  the  S&T
Directorate to a high standard of fiscal responsibility. Toward this end, I have estab-
lished an Office of Strategy, Policy & Budget Division led by the S&T Chief Finan-
cial Officer that has put in place the systems and protocols that will enable the S&T
Directorate  to  be  fully  responsive  and  transparent  in  the  budget  development  proc-
ess  and  in  the  sound  fiscal  management  of  S&T  appropriations.  This  new  office  is
enhancing the efficiency of S&T operations by integrating related functions of policy,
planning,  programming,  budgeting  and  execution.  Centralizing  financial  oversight
has  enabled  the  S&T  Directorate  to  implement  corrective  actions  to  address  finan-
cial  management  deficiencies  and  accelerate  the  distribution  of  funds  to  DHS  Lab-
oratories, Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratories, private industry and
academia. As a result, the S&T Directorate has committed approximately 50 percent
of  its  FY  2007  budget  compared  to  six  percent  at  the  same  time  last  year,  signifi-
cantly accelerating the distribution of funds to DHS Labs, DOE Labs, industry and
academia,  which  will  result  in  accelerated  technology  development  and  delivery  to
keep our nation safer.

In  other  developments,  I  have  added  a  director  of  Special  Programs  to  work  in
select,  mission-critical  areas.  And  a  new  director  of  Test  &  Evaluation  and  Stand-
ards  is  building  upon  the  S&T  Directorate’s  previous  work  in  homeland  security
standards  and  adding  test  and  evaluation  capabilities  to  advance  this  effort  and
draw greater industry participation in developing new technologies for homeland se-
curity applications throughout DHS. We have also established a Corporate Commu-
nications Office to inform and engage our customers and their customers in the S&T
Directorate’s broad investment portfolios.

I  also  know  that  we  must  look  beyond  our  Department,  indeed  beyond  our  na-
tion’s  borders,  for  solutions  in  combating  domestic  terrorism.  Therefore,  consistent
with  DHS  enabling  legislation,  I  have  established  Interagency  and  International
Program  Offices  responsible  for,  respectively,  coordinating  with  other  Executive
Branch  agencies  to  reduce  duplication  and  identify  unmet  needs,  and  coordinating
our international outreach efforts to help us tap into science and technology commu-

nities  across  the  globe  for  solutions  to  counter  domestic  terrorism.  Embedded  S&T
Directorate  liaisons  in  Europe,  the  Americas  and  Pacific/Asia  are  casting  a  wide
global  net  to  identify  the  most  viable  homeland  security  solutions  and  their  pro-
viders.  This  office  will  allow  S&T  to  benefit  from  and  leverage  off  of  the  efforts  of
our allies in the War on Terror.

I have developed mechanisms in three areas to better coordinate the scientific re-
search  and  technical  development  activities  of  the  S&T  Directorate  with  those  of
other federal Agencies.

First,  our  overarching  policy  is  to  leverage  research  and  development  efforts
across  the  Federal  Government  to  benefit  our  DHS  customers  as  well  as  first  re-
sponders.  Our  preference  is  to  avoid  replicating  efforts  underway  by  other  federal
agencies  in  favor  of  coordinating  and  collaborating  with  our  federal  counterparts  in
research  areas  of  mutual  interest  and  benefit.  The  Homeland  Security  Act  of  2002
provides me with specific authorities in this regard.

The second coordinating mechanism is aimed at better positioning the Directorate
to  increase  our  awareness  of,  and  the  opportunities  to  participate  in  or  otherwise
benefit  from,  other  federal  research,  development,  test  and  evaluation  (RDT&E)  ef-
forts  that  are  relevant  to  our  mission.  The  new  directors  for  Interagency  Coordina-
tion  and  Special  Programs  report  directly  to  me  regarding  their  progress  in  this
area.

The  third  mechanism  for  coordinating  research  and  development  (R&D)  is
through  specific  agreements  and  relationships.  For  example,  in  December  of  2006,
the  Department  of  Defense  (Homeland  Defense),  the  Department  of  Justice,  and
DHS  S&T  signed  a  Memorandum  of  Agreement  (MOA)  to  promote  closer  coordina-
tion  and  collaboration  of  our  R&D  and  technology  transfer  efforts.  The  S&T  Direc-
torate  is  also  actively  engaged  in  various  committees,  subcommittees,  and  working
groups  of  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council.  In  recent  months,  we  have
developed  a  closer  working  relationship  with  U.S.  Northern  Command,  U.S.  Joint
Forces Command, the Technology Support Working Group, the National Guard Bu-
reau,  and  the  Joint  IED  Defeat  Organization  regarding  research  and  development
initiatives,  defining  their  inter-operability  requirements  through  established  De-
fense Department, Joint, and military service-based processes as appropriate. In ad-
dition,  S&T  has  established  a  pilot  program  and  assigned  a  liaison  official  to  the
California Governor’s Office of Homeland Security in Sacramento in an effort to rec-
ognize and address coordination and inter-operability issues early on.

Last  December,  we  saw  the  ‘‘physical  manifestation’’  of  our  restructuring  plan
spring to life with the relocation of 340 of our staff members within the Directorate.
Staff  are  now  physically  co-located  within  their  new  organizational  alignments.  At
the  same  time,  I  issued  the  first  S&T  Organization  and  Requirements  Manual
(STORM)  that  defines  functions,  duties  and  responsibilities  for  the  administration
and  management  of  the  Directorate.  The  STORM  tells  our  customers  who  we  are
and  how  we  function  so  they  may  better  understand  the  capabilities  we  can  bring
to bear in support of their protective missions.

Throughout  this  process,  it  was  very  important  to  me  personally  that  S&T  staff
be  kept  informed  of  our  plans  for  the  realignment  and  that  they  have  a  forum  for
asking questions and expressing their views and concerns. Since last August, I have
held four ‘‘All Hands’’ meetings at regular intervals to brief all S&T staff, including
teleconference links with staff in other locations such as the Transportation Security
Laboratory  in  Atlantic  City,  Plum  Island  Animal  Disease  Center,  and  the  Environ-
mental Measurements Laboratory in New York City. These meetings also allow me
to  recognize  the  achievements  of  staff  members,  to  answer  questions  and  solicit
input, and, most importantly, express my gratitude for their excellent work and for
all  the  cooperation,  support  and  patience  they  have  exhibited  during  this  transi-
tional period.

During  the  first  six  months  of  my  tenure  as  Under  Secretary  for  Science  and
Technology,  I  have  focused  on  building  the  organization,  team  and  processes  that
are  necessary  for  any  science  and  technology  management  organization  to  succeed.
While our effort to completely institutionalize these changes continue, we now have
a foundation in place that allows us to focus on delivering products to our customers
as we execute our FY 2007 appropriation. The S&T Directorate is striving to be ef-
fective,  cost-efficient,  responsive,  agile  and  flexible,  and  with  your  support  of  the
President’s FY 2008 Budget Request we will build on our current momentum.
CUSTOMER/OUTPUT FOCUSED

The S&T Directorate functions as the science and technology manager within the
Department. We invest in science and technology that supports DHS components in
their  efforts  to  protect  our  homeland  against  catastrophic  events—technology  that
makes  the  Nation  safer.  In  the  last  six  months,  we  have  established  meaningful

working  relationships  with  our  DHS  operational  component  customers.  As  they  ap-
pear  before  you  this  year,  I  encourage  you  to  ask  them  about  the  ways  that  S&T
is  addressing  their  operational  needs.  Thanks  to  the  support  of  the  Congress  and
the  leadership  of  the  Department,  we  are  gaining  significant  momentum,  and  I
humbly  ask  for  your  continued  trust  and  support  so  that  we  can  build  on  those  ef-
forts.

The S&T Directorate develops and manages an integrated program of science and
technology, from basic research through technology transition to customers that are
the  operating  components  of  DHS,  State,  local  and  tribal  governments,  first  re-
sponders  and  private  sector  entities.  The  managers  of  this  program  are  predomi-
nantly active scientists and engineers in the many disciplines relevant to Homeland
Security. They are guided by a multi-tiered investment strategy and review process
based on higher guidance, the stated needs of our customers, and technology oppor-
tunities.

S&T’s three R&D portfolios support a broad range of program activities across the
Directorate.  The  President’s  FY  2008  Budget  Request  includes  $86  million  for  the
basic  research  portfolio  which  addresses  the  long-term  R&D  needs  for  the  Depart-
ment  in  sciences  of  enduring  relevance  to  Homeland  Security.  The  transition  port-
folio,  designed  to  provide  mission-capability  relevant  technology  in  support  of  the
Department’s  acquisition  programs,  is  driven  by  customer  needs  through  a  DHS
customer-led IPT process. The President has requested $343 million in FY 2008 for
this effort. The Director of HSARPA administers the $73 million innovation portfolio
(including  the  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  program)  to  promote  revolu-
tionary  changes  in  technologies  with  a  focus  on  prototyping  and  deploying  tech-
nologies critical to homeland security. This portfolio, balanced around risk, cost, im-
pact and time to delivery, produces capabilities of high technical quality responsive
to homeland security requirements.

Basic Research (> 8 years)

The  S&T  Directorate’s  basic  research  portfolio  addresses  long-term  research  and
development  needs  in  support  of  DHS  mission  areas  that  will  provide  the  Nation
with  an  enduring  capability  in  homeland  security.  This  type  of  focused,  protracted
research  investment  has  the  potential  to  lead  to  paradigm  shifts  in  the  Nation’s
homeland security capabilities.

The  S&T  Directorate’s  basic  research  program  enables  fundamental  research  at
our  universities,  government  laboratories  and  in  the  private  sector.  Approximately
$95 million is allocated for basic research in FY 2007 and $86 million or 13 percent
of  S&T’s  RDT&E  budget,  is  allocated  in  FY  2008.  Eventually,  I  would  like  up  to
20  percent  of  the  S&T  Directorate  budget  allocated  for  basic  research.  It  is  critical
that basic research be funded at consistent levels from year to year to ensure a con-
tinuity  of  effort  from  the  research  community  in  critical  areas  that  will  seed  home-
land  security  science  and  technology  for  the  next  generation  of  Americans  and  pre-
vent technological surprise.

Product Transition (0 to 3 years)

21

The centerpiece of the S&T Directorate’s product transition portfolio are Capstone
Integrated  Product  Teams  (IPT)  that  function  in  mission-critical  areas  to  identify
our  customers’  needs  and  enable  and  transition  near-term  capabilities  for  address-
ing  them.  These  Capstone  IPTs  engage  DHS  customers,  acquisition  partners,  S&T
technical  division  heads,  and  end-users  as  appropriate  in  our  product  research,  de-
velopment, transition and acquisition activities.

The IPT process enables our customers to identify and prioritize their operational
capability gaps and requirements and make informed decisions about technology in-
vestments.  The  S&T  Directorate,  in  turn,  gathers  the  information  it  needs  to  re-
spond  with  applicable  technology  solutions  for  closing  these  capability  gaps.  The
science and technology solutions that are the outcome of this process, referred to as
Enabling Homeland Capabilities, draw upon technologies that can be developed, ma-
tured, and delivered to our customer acquisition programs within three years.

Capstone  IPTs  have  been  established  in  10  major  areas:  Information  Sharing/
Management;  Cyber  Security;  People  Screening;  Border  Security;  Chemical/Biologi-
cal  Defense;  Maritime  Security;  Explosive  Prevention;  Cargo  Security;  Infrastruc-
ture  Protection;  and  Incident  Management  (includes  first  responder  inter-oper-
ability).

The  S&T  Directorate’s  product  transition/IPT  process  ensures  that  appropriate
technologies are engineered and integrated into the DHS acquisition system for our
customers. The $343 million allocated for product transition for FY 2008 represents
nearly half of my RDT&E budget.

The  IPT  process  has  created  an  excellent  forum  for  the  S&T  Directorate  to  gain
a  better  understanding  of  the  most  important  issues  of  our  customer  agencies.  An-
other tangible benefit of this Capstone IPT process has been improved coordination
in  addressing  common  functional  challenges  across  the  Department.  This  is  due  in
large  measure  to  the  enthusiastic  participation  of  DHS  agency  heads  such  as  TSA
Administrator  Kip  Hawley,  Secret  Service  Director  Mark  Sullivan,  and  Border  Pa-
trol  Chief  David  Aguilar  and  many  other  DHS  leaders  who  have  all  personally
chaired the IPTs relevant to their interests.

In  FY  2008,  the  S&T  Directorate  plans  to  transition  or  transfer  four  programs
that pre-date the IPT process. These programs have reached technical maturity and
will  be  transferred  to  other  DHS  agencies  who  will  be  responsible  for  their  contin-
ued  operation.  The  budget  request  reflects  the  transfer  to  the  Office  of  Health  Af-
fairs of the operations portions of BioWatch 1 & 2, the Biological Warning and Inci-
dent Characterization (BWIC) system, and the Rapidly Deployable Chemical Detec-
tion System, totaling $84.1 million. Moving the operations portions of BioWatch out
of  S&T  allows  us  to  focus  on  completing  the  development  of  BioWatch  3.  BioWatch
is a bio-aerosol monitoring system designed to provide cities the earliest possible de-
tection  of  a  biological  attack.  BWIC  interprets  warning  signals  from  BioWatch  and
public health surveillance data using incident characterization tools (e.g., plume and
epidemiological  models)  to  quickly  determine  the  potential  impacts  a  release  may
have.  Together,  these  two  systems  provide  emergency  personnel  with  the  informa-
tion  they  need  to  respond  effectively  and  initiate  life-saving  medical  counter-
measures. In addition, the FY 2008 budget request reflects the transfer of the non-
R&D  component  of  the  SAFECOM  program  to  the  National  Protection  and  Pro-
grams Directorate, totaling $5.0 million.

It  is  important  that  the  S&T  Directorate  also  engage  the  emergency  responder
community and address operational issues to help them do their jobs more quickly,
effectively and safely. S&T’s Technology Clearinghouse and TechSolutions initiatives
provide  direct  support  to  emergency  responders’  technology  needs.  The  Technology
Clearinghouse, created in accordance with a provision of the Homeland Security Act
of 2002, is designed to be a ‘‘one-stop shop’’ for access to technology information for
federal,  State,  and 
first  responder  communities.

TechSolutions  provides  a  Web-based  mechanism  for  responders  to  register  their
input regarding capability gaps that need to be addressed to help them in their jobs.
S&T responds by identifying existing technology that may meet the need, or if noth-
ing is available, proceeding with the rapid prototyping of an appropriate solution to
be  fielded  in  less  than  18  months.  S&T  also  houses  the  Office  for  Inter-operability
and  Compatibility,  which  includes  some  components  of  the  legacy  SAFECOM  pro-
gram and aims to increase levels of emergency responder inter-operability by devel-
oping  tools  and  methodologies,  as  well  as  advancing  standards  that  emergency  re-
sponse agencies can put into effect.
Innovative Capabilities (2 to 5 years)

S&T’s  Innovation/HSARPA  portfolio  supports  a  key  goal  of  mine  for  the  Direc-
torate in its efforts to put advanced capabilities into the hands of our customers as
soon as possible. It has made important inroads in research areas aligned with our
DHS  customers.  Toward  this  end,  S&T  has  introduced  two  important  new  initia-
tives.  One  of  these,  Homeland  Innovative  Prototypical  Solutions  (HIPS)  is  designed
to  deliver  prototype-level  demonstrations  of  game-changing  technologies  within  two
to five years.

The  second  initiative,  High  Impact  Technology  Solutions  (HITS),  is  designed  to
provide  proof-of-concept  solutions  within  one  to  three  years  that  could  result  in
high-payoff  technology  breakthroughs.  While  these  projects  are  very  high-risk,  they
offer  the  potential  for  ‘‘leap-ahead’’  gains  in  capability  should  they  succeed.  While
projects  are  separately  budgeted  in  ‘‘Innovation/HSARPA’’  (based  on  moderate  to
high  risk  with  a  high  payoff,  if  successful),  ALL  are  executed  within  the  six  tech-
nical divisions.

The  S&T  Directorate  also  continues  to  manage  an  active  Small  Business  Innova-
tive  Research  (SBIR)  program  on  behalf  of  DHS  that  currently  issues  two  solicita-
tions  each  year  and  generates  multiple  awards  for  the  small  business  community.
The first solicitation for FY 2007 opens in mid-February and the second solicitation
is planned for release in May. The solicitations will address topics in areas that are
aligned with the six technical divisions.

The Innovation/HSARPA portfolio is receiving $60 million in FY 2008 funding for
the innovative/leap-ahead HIPS and HITS projects. Because of the short timeline for
HIPS  and  HITS,  we  anticipate  that  these  projects  will  respond  to  the  urgent  needs
of the DHS components for solutions to fill capability gaps.
ENABLING U.S. LEADERSHIP IN SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
University-Based Centers of Excellence

The  S&T  Directorate  is  developing  a  robust,  results-oriented  network  of  Home-
land  Security  Centers  of  Excellence  (COEs)  to  leverage  the  independent  thinking
and  ground-breaking  capabilities  of  the  Nation’s  colleges  and  universities.  The
COEs are conducting multi-disciplinary research and education, each focused on an
area  critical  to  homeland  security.  The  Office  of  University  Programs  is  providing
the  communications  and  infrastructure  to  produce,  share,  and  transition  the  Cen-
ters’ research results, data, and technology to customers and end-users.

Currently, seven pre-existing COEs connect experts and researchers at more than
80  colleges  and  universities,  including  several  Minority  Serving  Institutions  (MSI).
More  than  20  partners  representing  industry,  laboratories,  think  tanks,  nonprofit
organizations,  and  other  agencies  also  participate.  University  Programs  is  coordi-
nating  COE  efforts  with  other  S&T  Directorate-sponsored,  university-based  initia-
tives. Under the new S&T organizational construct, existing COEs are being strate-
gically aligned with at least one S&T division, or to Directorate-wide activities such
as  Operations  Analysis  and  the  Homeland  Security  Institute,  in  a  structure  that
will  best  support  the  Divisions’  fundamental  research  and  development  activities
and other requirements.

We are proceeding with plans to establish four additional COEs over the next two
fiscal  years  to  help  round-out  the  Directorate’s  need  for  university-based  funda-
mental research. The new COEs will combine the research missions of some existing
COEs  and  add  new  research  areas  under  the  division-aligned  construct  to  meet
DHS  needs.  S&T  has  released  Broad  Agency  Announcements  (BAAs)  regarding
plans  to  establish  new  COEs  in  the  areas  of  explosives  detection,  mitigation,  and
response;  border  security  and  immigration;  maritime,  island,  and  extreme/remote
environment  security;  and  natural  disasters,  coastal  infrastructure  and  emergency
management.  The  competitive  selection  process  is  designed  to  ensure  that  institu-
tions  of  high  quality  and  academic  merit  participate  from  as  many  areas  of  the
United States as practicable.

DHS Scholars and Fellows Program

DHS education programs are helping to attract and nurture future scientific lead-
ers for the homeland security workforce and to strengthen the expertise of our exist-
ing  labor  pool.  University  Programs  is  engaging  high-performing  students  through
the  DHS  Scholars  and  Fellows  program.  Increasingly,  S&T’s  scholarships  and  fel-
lowships  will  become  aligned  to  the  Centers  of  Excellence  and  to  the  DHS  mission.
During this period of transition, we will honor our commitments to all currently par-
ticipating Scholars and Fellows.

The FY 2008 budget requests $38.7 million for S&T’s University Programs, which
includes the Homeland Security Centers of Excellence and the Scholars and Fellows
Program.

Office of National Laboratories

In  carrying  out  its  mission,  the  S&T  Directorate  works  to  develop,  sustain,  and
renew a coordinated network of DOE National Laboratories, federal laboratories and
University  Centers,  the  infrastructure  needed  by  multi-disciplinary  teams  of  sci-
entists, engineers and academics to discover, develop and transition homeland secu-
rity capabilities to operational end-users.

The  FY  2008  budget  request  includes  $88.8  million  for  the  Office  for  National
Laboratories  (ONL),  through  which  the  S&T  Directorate’s  laboratory  facilities  pro-
grams  are  executed.  ONL  provides  the  Nation  with  a  coordinated,  enduring  core  of
productive science, technology and engineering laboratories, organizations and insti-
tutions,  which  can  supply  knowledge  and  technology  required  to  secure  our  home-
land.  In  addition  to  oversight  of  laboratory  operations  in  direct  support  of  the  De-
partment and its missions, ONL also has the specific responsibility for coordinating
homeland  security-related  activities  and  laboratory-directed  research  conducted
within the DOE National Laboratories.

Industry Participation in DHS Science & Technology

Industry is a valued partner of DHS S&T and its continued participation in devel-
oping solutions for homeland security applications is vital to our effort to safeguard
the Nation. Consistent with S&T’s new structure, our Innovation/HSARPA portfolio
and  six  technical  divisions  will  be  releasing  BAAs  that  seek  industry  participation
to  address  specific  challenges  in  their  respective  areas.  For  example,  Innovation/
HSARPA  has  already  posted  BAAs  seeking  expertise  in  tunnel  detection  tech-
nologies, container security (SAFECON program), and a mobile screening laboratory
to support human screening R&D in the field.

Innovation/HSARPA plans to release six additional BAAs shortly to address areas
that include critical infrastructure protection, hostile intent detection and other key
areas.  By  spring  2007,  we  intend  to  issue  a  BAA  for  longer-term  efforts  that  cover
our complete innovation topic area portfolio.

No  one  knows  where  good  ideas  come  from  and  for  that  reason  I  have  been  per-
sonally proactive in both seeking out and receiving technology briefs and opportuni-
ties. This is a culture I am working to instill throughout the DHS S&T Directorate.
The  Support  Anti-terrorism  by  Fostering  Effective  Technologies  (SAFETY)  Act  of
2002,  administered  in  the  S&T  Directorate,  is  proving  to  be  a  valuable  tool  in  ex-
panding  the  creation,  proliferation  and  use  of  cutting  edge  anti-terrorism  tech-
nologies throughout the United States. Over the past year we have made significant
improvements  in  implementing  the  Act,  including  a  new  Rule;  a  revised,  stream-
lined  Application  Kit;  new  coverage  for  emerging  technologies  that  are  undergoing
test and evaluation; increased use of pre-application teleconferences between SAFE-
TY  Act  technology  evaluators  and  applicants  to  review  requirements  and  answer
questions  prior  to  submitting  a  full  application;  and  formal  procedures  to  expedite
applications  for  technologies  involved  with  pending  government  procurements.  The
Office of SAFETY Act Implementation (OSAI) has made significant strides in reduc-
ing  application  processing  time  and  providing  more  Qualified  Anti-Terrorism  Tech-
nologies  (QATTs)  that  could  save  lives.  Through  increased  efficiencies  and  process
improvements,  the  average  time  to  process  SAFETY  Act  applications  has  been  re-
duced  from  233  days  in  the  early  days  of  the  program  to  less  than  140  days  in  FY
2007.  As  of  February  2007,  OASI  has  received  223  full  applications  and  376  pre-
applications. A total of 137 SAFETY Act awards have been granted—87 applications
have qualified for both Designation and Certification and 50 have received Designa-
tion  only.  I  am  mindful  of  the  interest  in  this  program  in  the  Congress  and  across
the Nation.

As part of our outreach efforts to encourage greater industry participation, the Di-
rectorate is hosting the first Homeland Security Science & Technology Stakeholders
Conference,  May  21–24.  The  conference  will  inform  government,  industry  and  aca-

demia of the direction, emphasis, and scope of the research investments by the S&T
Directorate,  and  provide  information  about  business  opportunities.  The  conference
will present the Directorate’s new organization, explain how to do business with the
DHS  S&T  research  enterprise,  and  provide  visibility  into  new  and  emerging  tech-
nologies  through  an  Innovation  Gateway  Marketplace.  I  hope  you  will  join  us  for
this event at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center.
FY 2008 BUDGET OVERVIEW

Science  and  Technology  Directorate’s  budget  request  of  $799.1  million  includes
$142.6  million  for  Management  and  Administration  (M&A)  and  $656.5  million  for
research,  development,  testing  and  evaluation.  M&A  funds  federal  employees’  sala-
ries, benefits, travel, and other expenses at Headquarters and the S&T laboratories.
This staff maintains oversight of S&T’s extensive day-to-day technical and adminis-
trative  operations.  M&A  also  funds  business  operations,  including  working  capital
fund, and management support. Research, Development, Acquisition and Operations
supports  the  needs  of  the  operational  components  of  the  Department  and  is  cat-
egorized to match the new S&T organization. The basic research, product transition
and  innovation  R&D  activities  undertaken  by  S&T  cut  across  the  Directorate  and
its divisions and are incorporated into the following projects and programs that are
included in the President’s budget for FY 2008.

• The  $25.9  million  requested  for  Borders  and  Maritime  Security  will  support
technology  development  for  the  Secure  Border  Initiative  (SBI),  a  comprehen-
sive  multi-year  plan  to  secure  America’s  borders.  This  Division  is  providing
the tools, processes, and manpower to ensure SBI implementation is effective
and affordable. We are working directly with the SBI program executive office
to  provide  a  transformation  strategy  for  SBI;  develop  the  next  generation  of
modeling and analysis tools for strategic planning; and provide systems engi-
neering support. The Division will also develop and transition technologies to
industry  to  reduce  risk  and  support  border  security  programs  like  SBInet,  a
technology  acquisition  program  under  the  Customs  and  Border  Protection
SBInet Program Management Office.
We  are  also  developing  technologies  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  cargo  ship-
ments  with  known  origins,  and  to  better  target  suspicious  shipments,  and  to
enhance  the  end-to-end  security  of  the  supply  chain—from  the  manufacturer
of  goods  to  final  delivery.  One  of  the  most  significant  potential  terrorist
threats  to  the  Nation  is  the  vast  numbers  of  shipping  containers  that  flow
through  our  borders  each  year,  most  of  which  enter  without  physical  inspec-
tion.  Technologies  and  processes  developed  within  this  area  will  assure  gov-
ernment customs and shippers of the integrity of shipping containers and its
cargo and communicate the container’s status as well as security information.
By employing a system-of-systems approach, this will deliver technological ca-
pabilities  to  DHS  customers  and  end-users  that  address  supply  chain
vulnerabilities.  These  capabilities  are  directed  toward  enhanced  physical  se-
curity  and  information  management,  and  bound  by  a  security  architecture
which encompasses the world’s supply chain.
• The  $228.9  million  requested  for  Chemical  and  Biological  will  provide  the
basic knowledge, technologies and systems needed to protect against possible
chemical  and  biological  attacks  on  the  Nation’s  population,  agriculture  or  in-
frastructure.  The  greatest  emphasis  is  on  those  biological  attacks  that  have
the  greatest  potential  for  widespread  catastrophic  damage  to  the  population.
These include—but are not limited to—aerosolized anthrax, and smallpox.
The Division conducts material threat and risk assessments on both naturally
occurring  and  engineered  agents;  conducts  experiments  to  close  major  sci-
entific knowledge gaps that could have a large impact on how the Nation re-
sponds  to  a  biological  attack;  and  provides  scientific  support  to  the  intel-
ligence  community.  As  such,  the  primary  output  is  an  intelligence-informed,
scientific  characterization  and  prioritization  of  the  bio-terrorist  risks  to  be
used by the Homeland Security Council and partnering agencies (e.g., Depart-
ment  of  Health  and  Human  Services,  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  De-
partment of Agriculture, and the Intelligence Community).
Based  on  this  knowledge,  we  are  developing  effective  measures  for  deter-
rence,  detection,  and  mitigation  of  biological  terrorism  acts  against  the  U.S.
population,  infrastructure,  and  agricultural  system.  This  includes  developing
tools  to  meet  federal,  State,  and,  local  emergency  responder  needs  such  as
operational models to support Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assess-
ment Center (IMAAC).

26

The  Division  is  developing  next-generation,  biological-threat-agent  detectors
that recognize the signatures or fingerprints of biological agents. These detec-
tors  will  be  incorporated  into  the  BioWatch  system  to  substantially  increase
the  system’s  capabilities  and  significantly  reduce  the  response  time.  Other
significant  program  activities  include  developing  biological  aerosol  detection
and sensor systems for monitoring the Nation’s critical infrastructure such as
government  buildings,  airports,  subways,  office  buildings,  shopping  malls,
sports  arenas,  hotels  and  hospitals.  These  ‘‘detect-to-protect’’  systems  detect
biological agents within minutes (acting as reliable ‘smoke alarms’) to protect
high  value  facilities  and  their  occupants.  Many  of  the  technologies  being  de-
veloped in this program will be manufactured and used by the private sector.
Chemical  countermeasures  work  enhances  the  Nation’s  capability  to  antici-
pate, prevent, protect from, respond to and recover from chemical terrorist at-
tacks.  The  chemical  threat  spectrum  comprises  a  broad  array  of  chemicals,
to include chemical warfare agents, toxic industrial chemicals, and non-tradi-
tional agents (NTAs). Existing and emerging chemical warfare agents can po-
tentially  be  used  against  virtually  any  civilian  target  resulting  in  significant
loss of life and impedance in the use of key infrastructure. Chemical counter-
measures  addresses  these  threats  by:  enabling  comprehensive  understanding
and analyses of chemical threats; developing pre-event assessment, discovery,
and  interdiction  for  chemical  threats;  developing  warning,  notification,  and
timely analysis of chemical attacks; optimizing technology and process for re-
covery  from  chemical  attacks;  and  enhancing  the  capability  to  identify  a
chemical attack’s source.

• The  $63.6  million  requested  for  Command,  Control  and  Inter-operability  will
fund  programs  focused  on  cyber  security;  communications,  compatibility  and
inter-operability; and knowledge management.
Cyber  security  research,  development,  testing  and  evaluation  is  focused  on
improving  the  security  of  the  existing  cyber  infrastructure  and  providing  a
foundation  for  a  more  secure  infrastructure  through  coordinated  efforts  with
other government agencies and private industry. Cyber attacks on U.S. infor-
mation  networks  can  have  serious  consequences  such  as  disrupting  critical
operations,  causing  loss  of  revenue  and  intellectual  property,  or  loss  of  life.
The  Division  also  addresses  cyber  security  requirements  from  internal  De-
partment  customers  in  support  of  the  DHS’s  operational  missions  in  critical
infrastructure  protection.  It  also  addresses  related  aspects  of  national  secu-
rity and emergency preparedness telecommunications.
Communications,  inter-operability  and  compatibility  programs  within  Com-
mand,  Control  and  Inter-operability  strengthen  inter-operable  wireless  com-
munications,  improve  effective  information  sharing,  and  develop  tools  to  en-
hance  overall  coordination  and  planning  at  all  levels  of  government.  Cur-
rently, the Nation’s capacity for inter-operable communications is hindered by
sub-optimized  planning  and  coordination,  and  the  Office  for  Inter-operability
and  Compatibility  is  working  to  strengthen  and  integrate  inter-operability
and compatibility.
We are also developing knowledge management tools to reduce the risk of ter-
rorist attacks and to prepare for and respond to natural and man-made disas-
ters.  This  will  provide  new  capabilities  for  the  DHS  Intelligence  &  Analysis
Directorate and the DHS information enterprise for the integration, manage-
ment,  analysis,  and  dissemination  of  actionable  information.  This  knowledge
management research provides tools and methods to handle massive amounts
of information that is widely dispersed in a great variety of forms. Being able
to  find  such  information,  understand  its  meaning,  and  then  use  it  to  assess
an  actual  threat  and  determine  the  level  of  risk  before  an  attack  or  incident
occurs is the best way to save lives and preserve our way of life.

• The $63.7 million requested for Explosives will fund programs focused on the
detection,  mitigation,  and  response  to  explosives  threats  such  as  improvised
explosive  devices  (IEDs)  and  suicide  bombers.  The  Division  employs  a  broad
range  of  existing  and  emerging  approaches  to  detect  and  lessen  the  impact
of explosive materials. These include baggage-screening devices as well as the
capability to identify explosives residue. Terrorist events like the Madrid rail
bombing,  the  London  Underground  attack,  and  the  recent  disclosure  of
planned attacks on U.S.-bound flights from the United Kingdom, all involved
explosive  threats.  Those  events  underscore  the  operational  need  for  a  unified

27

approach  to  the  detection  of,  response  to,  and  mitigation  of  explosive  threats
across all modes of transportation.
In  explosives  detection,  we  are  improving  existing  explosive  detection  meth-
ods,  developing  new  technologies,  and  integrating  improvements  and  techno-
logical developments into both deployed and new systems. Detection is a key
defense against successful attacks. For example, the Check Point Program ap-
plies  to  multiple  venues  where  real  or  virtual  portals  exist.  Historically,  air-
ports  have  received  the  most  attention,  but  similar  portal  situations  can  be
found  at  rail  stations  and  cruise  ship  terminals.  Check  point  programs  ad-
dress suicide bombers, carry-ons, leave-behind IEDs, and vehicle-borne IEDs.
The two other principal programs in this area are checked baggage and cargo.
Like  aviation,  rail  and  ship  modes  share  checked  baggage  and  cargo  screen-
ing challenges.
The check point program addresses the risk of catastrophic loss of mass tran-
sit  resulting  from  small  IEDs  detonated  in  passenger  cabins  and  the  cata-
strophic  loss  or  hostile  takeover  of  mass  transit  resulting  from  the  presence
of  certain  weapons  in  passenger  cabins.  The  principal  objective  of  the  pro-
gram  is  developing  advanced  technology  for  integration  with  future  check
point  systems  to  detect  explosives  and  concealed  weapons,  while  meeting  re-
quirements  for  automation,  efficiency,  and  cost  reduction.  Longer-term  objec-
tives include applying systems integration and a seamless flow of information
with  reduced  impact  to  the  checkpoint  operations  environment.  The  program
also  strives  to  upgrade  currently  deployed  technologies  to  address  emerging
threats and concealment methods.
The  checked  baggage  program  identifies  and  develops  the  next  generation  of
checked  baggage  screening  systems,  and  supports  continuous  improvements
toward the Congressionally directed goal of 100 percent screening of aviation
checked baggage by electronic or other approved means with minimum or no
impact to the flow of people or commerce. Checked baggage will focus on con-
tinuing work with Manhattan II by conducting system development and inte-
gration of the Manhattan II checked baggage program, complete the prelimi-
nary  system  architecture  test  and  evaluation,  and  conduct  detection-tech-
nology test and evaluation.
The  cargo  program  is  developing  the  next  generation  of  air  cargo  screening
systems, with transition targeted for FY 2011.
• The  $12.6  million  requested  for  Human  Factors  will  apply  the  social  and  be-
havioral  sciences  to  improve  detection,  analysis,  and  the  understanding  of
threats posed by individuals, groups, and radical movements. This knowledge
will  support  the  preparedness,  response  and  recovery  of  communities  im-
pacted by catastrophic events and to advance national security by integrating
human factors into homeland security technologies. Further this will enhance
the  capability  to  control  movement  of  individuals  into  and  out  of  the  United
States and its critical assets through accurate, timely, and easy-to-use biomet-
ric identification and credentialing validation tools.
• The  $24.0  million  requested  for  Infrastructure  and  Geophysical  will  develop
technical  solutions  and  reach-back  capabilities  to  improve  State,  local,  tribal,
and private sector preparedness for and response to all hazardous events im-
pacting the population and critical infrastructure.
The Division’s focus is on identifying and mitigating the vulnerabilities of the
17  critical  infrastructure  sectors  and  key  assets  that  keep  our  society  and
economy  functional.  The  Division  models  and  simulates  the  Nation’s  critical
infrastructures  to  determine  how  various  scenarios  will  affect  each  sector,
provides  decision  support  tools  to  guide  decision-makers  in  identifying  gaps
and  vulnerabilities,  and  develops  predictive  tools  and  methods  to  aid  in  pre-
paring  for  and  responding  to  various  catastrophes.  Additionally,  the  Division
focuses on responder preparedness and response capabilities that improve the
ability  of  the  Nation  to  prepare  for,  respond  to,  and  recover  from  all-hazards
emergencies. Applying the best available science and technology for the safety
and  security  our  emergency  responders  and  homeland  security  professionals
ensures  they  may  effectively  perform  their  jobs—saving  lives  and  restoring
critical services.
The Division is also developing a capability that will enable owners and oper-
ators  of  the  most  vital  critical  infrastructure  sites  to  implement  affordable
and  reliable  blast  and  projectile  mitigation  measures  improving  capabilities

to withstand these threats. The program is developing suites of advanced ma-
terials,  design  procedures,  and  innovative  construction  methods  that  can  be
used to protect critical infrastructure and key resources.
In addition, the Division is developing decision-making and information-shar-
ing  tools  to  aid  responders.  This  will  dramatically  enhance  the  information
management  and  information  sharing  capabilities  of  incident  commanders
and  emergency  responders  as  emergencies  increasingly  demand  more  highly
coordinated responses.

• The  $59.9  million  requested  for  Innovation/HSARPA  will  focus  on  homeland
security research and development that poses a risk of failure, but if success-
ful would lead to significant technology breakthroughs that would greatly en-
hance  DHS  operations.  HSARPA  carries  out  its  activities  in  two  areas:  (1)
Homeland  Innovative  Prototypical  Solutions,  which  are  designed  to  deliver
prototype-level  demonstrations  of  game-changing  technologies  in  two  to  five
years. These programs are moderate risk, but offer high pay-off and (2) High
Impact  Technology  Solutions,  which  are  designed  to  provide  proof-of-concept
answers  that  could  result  in  high-payoff  technology  breakthroughs.  Though
there is a considerable risk of failure, these projects offer the potential for sig-
nificant gains resulting from success.

• The  $88.8  million  requested  for  Laboratory  Facilities  will  fund  operation  of
the S&T laboratory facilities, including Plum Island, the Transportation Secu-
rity  Lab,  Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory,  the  Chemical  Security
Analysis Center, and the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures
Center. Laboratory Facilities also funds design work on the National Bio and
Agrodefense Facility and upgrade of the Plum Island facility.

• The  $25.5  million  requested  for  Test  &  Evaluation  and  Standards  funds  two
areas Test and Evaluation (T&E) and Standards. T&E works across DHS and
ensures  that  systems  meet  the  capability  needs  of  users,  validates  perform-
ance and provides measurable improvement to operational capabilities. Effec-
tive  testing  and  evaluation  programs  provide  crucial  information  to  decision-
makers  for  acquisition  and  deployment  of  technology.  Standards  are  con-
sensus  based  measures—from  basic  specifications  to  performance  criteria—
that give DHS and its customers confidence that technology and systems will
perform  as  required.  The  S&T  Directorate  works  across  DHS  and  with  nu-
merous  external  partners  to  build  consensus  and  support  development  of
needed standards.

• The $24.7 million requested for Transition programs will expedite technology
transition to deliver near-term products and technologies to meet DHS compo-
nent requirements. This area also funds the Office of the SAFETY Act Imple-
mentation,  transition  support  programs  such  as  the  Technology  Clearing-
house, and the S&T Directorate’s international and interagency programs.

• The  $38.7  million  requested  for  University  Programs  will  allow  the  S&T  Di-
rectorate  to  engage  the  academic  community  to  support  current  DHS  prior-
ities  and  enhance  homeland  security  capabilities  by  providing  ground-break-
ing  research,  analyses  and  educational  approaches.  The  program  is  designed
to  bring  together  the  best  scientific  talent  and  resources  from  U.S.  academic
institutions  to  help  solve  complex  and  technologically  challenging  homeland
security  problems  facing  our  nation.  Program  activities  simultaneously  focus
on building homeland security expertise in the academic community, creating
strategic  partnerships,  and  fostering  a  new  generation  of  homeland  security
experts.
The program works to:

• Strengthen U.S. scientific leadership in homeland security research;
• Generate  and  disseminate  knowledge  and  technical  advances  to  aid

homeland security frontline professionals;

• Foster  a  homeland  security  culture  within  the  academic  community

through research and education programs; and

• Build  a  highly-trained  science  and  engineering  workforce  dedicated  to

homeland security that will sustain progress over time.

This  program  invests  in  two  areas:  the  university-based  Centers  of  Excel-
lence,  and  student  Scholarships  and  Fellowships  intended  to  build  and  de-
velop the next generation of academic researchers in disciplines that are rel-
evant and essential to homeland security.

In  conclusion,  I  am  pleased  to  report  that  the  S&T  Directorate  is  well  positioned
today to mobilize the Nation’s vast technical and scientific capabilities to enable so-
lutions to detect, protect against and recover from catastrophic events.

Our plans for restructuring the organization have been implemented and it is in-
deed  gratifying  to  see  that  they  appear  to  be  working  as  we  advance  to  the  critical
phase  of  product  transition.  Increasingly,  our  DHS  customers  are  recognizing  the
substantial value that S&T’s technical expertise brings to their operations. We have
engaged  them,  eliciting  participation  at  the  highest  levels,  to  join  us  at  the  table
to work constructively on solutions for countering the formidable threats this nation
faces.

We appreciate the many demands on the taxpayers’ precious dollars and you have
my  commitment  that  the  S&T  Directorate  will  be  wise  stewards  of  the  public  mon-
ies you have entrusted to us. We are steadfast in our resolve to serve the best inter-
ests of the Nation by investing in the talent and technology that will provide Amer-
ica  with  a  sustainable  capability  to  protect  against  acts  of  terror  and  other  high-
consequence events for generations to come.

Members  of  the  Committee,  I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  meet  with  you
today to discuss a newly realigned Science & Technology Directorate that is meeting
homeland  security  challenges  with  a  renewed  sense  of  purpose  and  mission.  I  look
forward to working with you throughout the 110th Congress.

BIOGRAPHY FOR JAY M. COHEN

Department  of  Homeland  Security,  Under  Secretary  for  Science  and  Technology,
Jay M. Cohen is a native of New York. He was commissioned in 1968 as an Ensign
upon  graduation  from  the  United  States  Naval  Academy.  He  holds  a  joint  Ocean
Engineering  degree  from  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  and  Woods  Hole
Oceanographic  Institution  and  Master  of  Science  in  Marine  Engineering  and  Naval
Architecture from MIT.

His  early  Navy  assignments  included  service  on  conventional  and  nuclear  sub-
marines. From 1985 to 1988 Cohen commanded USS HYMAN G. RICKOVER (SSN
709).

Following  command,  he  served  on  the  U.S.  Atlantic  Fleet  as  a  senior  member  of
the  Nuclear  Propulsion  Examining  Board,  responsible  for  certifying  the  safe  oper-
ation of nuclear powered ships and crews.

From 1991 to 1993, he commanded USS L.Y. SPEAR (AS 36) including a deploy-

ment to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation DESERT STORM.

After  Spear,  he  reported  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Navy  as  Deputy  Chief  of  Navy
Legislative  Affairs.  During  this  assignment,  Cohen  was  responsible  for  supervising
all Navy-Congressional liaison.

Cohen  was  promoted  to  the  rank  of  Rear  Admiral  in  October  1997  and  reported
to the Joint Staff as Deputy Director for Operations responsible to the President and
DOD leaders for strategic weapons release authority.

In June 1999, he assumed duties as Director Navy Y2K Project Office responsible

for transitioning all Navy computer systems into the new century.

In  June  2000,  Cohen  was  promoted  in  rank  and  became  the  20th  Chief  of  Naval
Research.  He  served  during  war  as  the  Department  of  the  Navy  Chief  Technology
Officer (a direct report to the Secretary of the Navy, Chief of Naval Operations and
Commandant  of  the  Marine  Corps).  Responsible  for  the  Navy  and  Marine  Corps
Science  and  Technology  (S&T)  Program  (involving  basic  research  to  applied  tech-
nology  portfolios  and  contracting),  Cohen  coordinated  investments  with  other  U.S.
and  international  S&T  providers  to  rapidly  meet  war  fighter  combat  needs.  After
an unprecedented five and a half year assignment as Chief of Naval Research, Rear
Admiral Cohen retired on February 1, 2006.

Under  Secretary  Cohen  was  sworn  in  to  his  current  position  at  the  Department

of Homeland Security on August 10, 2006.

Committee for the opportunity to present DNDO’s research and de-
velopment  priorities  for  fiscal  year  2008.  I  am  pleased  to  be  here
with  my  colleague,  Under  Secretary  Cohen,  and  other  colleagues
from past lives that are with me also here on the panel.

DNDO  is  chartered  to  develop  a  global  nuclear  detection  archi-
tecture that would form a robust defensive layer to prevent nuclear
and radiological terrorism. We are also asked to direct all radiation
detection  development  programs  on  behalf  of  DHS  and  to  work  as
the  U.S.  Government  collaborator  with  other  Departments  regard-
ing research and development for the radiological and nuclear area.
We  invest  in  the  enhancement  of  existing  technologies  through
both  a  near-term  spiral  development  program,  as  well  as  a  trans-
formational  research  and  development  program  to  deliver  revolu-
tionary  improvements  in  the  performance  of  nuclear  detection  sys-
tems.  Today  I  will  highlight  the  near-term  and  transformational
plans for 2008, and touch upon how DNDO coordinates its R&D ac-
tivities with other federal agencies.

Regarding  near-term  R&D  priorities,  we  feel  we  must  finish  the
work  of  securing  our  nation’s  ports  of  entries.  However,  we  cannot
ignore  the  possibility  that  a  terrorist  might  attempt  to  illicitly
transport  a  nuclear  or  radioactive  material  between  the  ports  of
entry.

DNDO’s  near-term  focus  is  on  making  further  improvements  to
radiation  detection  capabilities  for  the  national  ports  of  entry,
while  also  developing  solutions  for  non-ports  of  entry  threats.  We
are  testing  the  Advanced  Spectroscopic  Portal  at  the  Nevada  Test
Site  and  the  New  York  Container  Terminal.  Results  of  these  tests
will  be  used  to  support  the  Secretary’s  certification  decision  as  re-
quired  by  the  2007  Appropriations  Bill.  And  in  2008,  we  will  also
complete development and begin production for ASP variants to in-
clude mobile truck mounted systems, as well as shuttle carrier sys-
tems  that  address  specific  challenges  presented  at  some  of  our  sea
ports  that  load  cargo  directly  from  ships  to  rail.  The  Cargo  Ad-
vanced  Automated  Radiography  System  will  automatically  detect
high density shielding within cargo that could escape the detection
by  our  passive  systems.  The  automated  imaging  processing  capa-
bilities  and  vision  for  CAARS  will  substantially  improve  through-
put rates over current generation radiography systems.

Development  of  these  technologies  will  continue  in  2008,  with
prototypes  being  delivered  in  mid  2009.  DNDO’s  Human  Portable
Radiation  Detection  System  Program  will  improve  current  and
backpack  radiation  detection  systems  by  improving  identification
capabilities,  standardizing  displays  and  controls,  reducing  weight,
and improving system connectivity so that data can be rapidly com-
municated and analyzed.

Within  our  long-term  transformational  research  program  we  in-
clude  an  exploratory  research  program,  a  dedicated  Academic  Re-
search  Initiative,  and  several  upcoming  advanced  technology  dem-
onstrations.  In  exploratory  research  we  have  initiated  44  projects
with our national laboratories. We have recently awarded seven co-
operative  agreements  with  academia,  and  next  week  we  will  an-
nounce 10 awards with private industry. These efforts have already
begun to pay off.

An  automated  process  established  at  Lawrence  Berkeley  Na-
tional Laboratories allows us to evaluate over 100 new detector ma-
terials  per  month  or  over  1,000  per  year,  a  tenfold  increase  over
previous capabilities within this country. Proof of concept efforts on
several  standoff  technologies  have  demonstrated  that  very  small
amounts  of  material  can  be  detected  at  20  miles  per  hour  from  a
distance of over 65 meters. Again, a tremendous improvement over
previous and current capabilities.

In  2008,  our  Advanced  Technology  Demonstration  Programs  will
include  an  Intelligent  Personal  Radiation  Locator  that  responds  to
a  user  requirement  to  improve  upon  capabilities  in  personal  radi-
ation devices for discrimination as well as localization of threat ma-
terials.  Our  Standoff  Detection  Advanced  Technology  Demonstra-
tion will develop and evaluate technologies to significantly increase
detection  ranges  out  to  100  meters.  The  verification  of  Shielded
Special Nuclear Material Advanced Technology Demonstration will
develop  and  test  advanced  technologies  to  verify  the  presence  of
special nuclear material in cluttered environments and may lead to
a human portable capability to automatically verify the presence of
shielded special nuclear material.

Finally,  a  survey  by  the  National  Science  Foundation  and  the
Department  of  Energy  showed  a  downward  trend  in  this  nation’s
nuclear science expertise. In 1980, there were 65 nuclear engineer-
ing departments in our U.S. universities. Today there are 29. Cur-
rently it is estimated that one-third to three-quarters of the current
nuclear  workforce  will  reach  retirement  age  in  the  next  10  years.
DNDO’s  Academic  Research  Initiative  will  spur  the  academic  com-
munity  to  provide  the  nuclear  detection  experts  of  the  future  by
funding  universities  to  conduct  R&D  in  the  areas  relevant  to  nu-
clear detection. Last month DNDO and the National Science Foun-
dation  solicited  grant  applications  from  our  colleges  and  univer-
sities to help begin this new academic initiative.

Regarding  coordination  with  other  organizations,  we  recognize
that  several  federal  agencies  already  engage  in  research  in  this
area,  so  we  have  coordinated  our  activities  with  the  National  Nu-
clear Security Administration, the Defense Threat Reduction Agen-
cy,  and  the  Director  for  National  Intelligence.  Several  mechanisms
are currently in place to insure active coordination of these efforts.
These include joint participation in the Domestic Nuclear Research
and  Development  Working  Group,  chaired  by  the  President’s
science  advisor,  an  interagency  working  group  that  is  intended  to
create an R&D roadmap for the future.

DNDO  also  supports  Department  of  Energy  activities  by  jointly
reviewing proposals that come into both organizations to make sure
that  we  are  collaborating  and  reducing  the  conflict  of  funding.  We
do that also with the Department of Defense.

Finally,  in  conclusion,  let  me  say  the  challenges  that  lie  ahead
require  coordinated  effort  on  behalf  of  the  best  scientific  minds  in
this country, from fostering the development of revolutionary detec-
tion technologies that fill gaps in our evolving architecture, to pro-
viding next-generation technologies that improve performance, cost,
and  operational  value.  DNDO  is  working  to  provide  the  Nation
with  a  continuously  improving  capability  to  protect  against  a  ter-
rorist nuclear attack.

And  I  would  at  this  time  yield  the  rest  of  my  time  and  be  glad

to answer any questions, Mr. Chairman.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Oxford follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF VAYL S. OXFORD

Introduction

Good morning Chairman Wu, Ranking Member Gingrey, and distinguished Mem-
bers  of  the  Subcommittee.  As  Director  of  the  Domestic  Nuclear  Detection  Office
(DNDO), I would like to thank the Committee for the opportunity to discuss our re-
search and development (R&D) priorities for Fiscal Year 2008 and how these activi-
ties will directly enhance the probability of mission success. I am pleased to be here
with  other  distinguished  witnesses,  Under  Secretary  Cohen,  Mr.  Czerwinski,  Dr.
Epstein, and Ms. Ward.

Key  to  the  success  of  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  is  improving
the Department’s ability to mitigate risks across the entire threat spectrum. In rec-
ognition  of  the  catastrophic  risk  posed  by  the  use  of  a  nuclear  weapon  within  the
United  States,  all  nuclear  detection  research,  development,  test,  evaluation,  and
operational  support  within  the  Department  was  consolidated  into  the  DNDO  in
April  of  2005.  Since  then  DNDO  has  developed,  and  continues  to  evolve,  the  global
nuclear  detection  architecture,  while  improving  the  domestic  means  to  detect  and
report attempts to import or transport a nuclear device or fissile or radiological ma-
terial intended for illicit use.

DNDO  maintains  a  preeminent  research  and  development  program  and  capital-
izes on the benefits of integrating this program with larger acquisition efforts. Over
half of DNDO’s Fiscal Year 2008 budget request is intended for R&D activities. We
categorize  our  R&D  work  into  two  areas:  enhancement  of  existing  technologies
through  near-term,  spiral  development;  and  long-term  transformational  R&D  that
will  deliver  revolutionary  improvements  in  the  cost,  performance  and  associated
operational burdens of nuclear detection systems.

Today,  I  will  be  discussing  both  our  near-term  and  transformational  R&D  plans
for FY 2008. As I describe these efforts, I will share with you how DNDO uses archi-
tectural  analysis  and  end-user  requirements  to  help  guide  not  only  acquisition  ef-
forts,  but  also  our  research  agenda.  I  will  also  touch  upon  how  DNDO  coordinates
its  scientific  research  and  technical  development  activities  with  other  federal  agen-
cies.
Near-Term R&D Priorities

Our analysis of the detection architecture concluded that we must finish the work
of securing our nation’s ports of entry (POEs). However, we cannot ignore the possi-
bility  that  a  terrorist  might  attempt  to  illicitly  transport  a  nuclear  device  or  radio-
active  material  between  the  POEs.  DNDO’s  near-term  focus  is  on  making  further
improvements  to  radiation  detection  capabilities  for  the  Nation’s  POEs  as  well  as
developing solutions for non-POE applications. These include general aviation, small
maritime craft, non-POE land border crossings, and State and local operations.

DNDO will continue our Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) program, which im-
proves  upon  existing  polyvinyl  toluene  (PVT)-based  radiation  portal  monitors  that
are  currently  deployed  at  the  Nation’s  POEs,  and  select  foreign  POEs  through  the
DOE  Megaports  Initiative.  ASP  systems  not  only  detect  the  presence  of  radiation,
but  also  identify  the  radiation  source,  enabling  the  system  to  discriminate  real
threat alarms from alarms due to normally occurring radioactive material (NORM).
Alarms  due  to  NORM  are  also  known  as  nuisance  alarms.  The  use  of  spectroscopic
identification dramatically reduces nuisance alarms, and will allow for considerably
improved  throughput  at  high-volume  ports,  while  simultaneously  improving  secu-
rity. DNDO awarded contracts to Raytheon Company, Thermo Electron Corporation,
and Canberra Industries, Inc. for the development and production of ASP last July.
Approximately  $44.5  million  was  immediately  provided  to  the  three  vendors.  Based
on results of system performance tests now underway and upon certification by the
Secretary,  DNDO  plans  to  award  up  to  $1.1  billion  over  a  five-year  period  to  com-
plete ASP development and acquisition.

In  FY  2008,  we  will  complete  development  and  test  phases  and  begin  production
for:  truck-mounted  ASP  systems  that  provide  mobility  for  several  applications,  in-
cluding  relocatable  chokepoint  applications  in  State  and  local  operations,  or  at  low-
volume  POEs  where  fixed  systems  may  not  be  cost  effective;  and  shuttle  carrier-
mounted ASP systems that address the challenge presented by several seaports that
load  cargo  directly  from  ships  to  rail  cars,  therefore  bypassing  typical  exit  gate
screening  operations.  By  developing  additional  passive  detection  design  variants

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 Jun 11, 2007 Jkt 033611 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\T&I07\030807\33611 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

that  meet  unique  port  requirements,  DNDO  will  be  well  on  its  way  to  achieving
technical solutions that enable us to screen 100 percent of cargo containers entering
the  United  States.  To  support  all  of  our  passive  systems,  we  will  be  upgrading  the
standard  ASP  cargo  portals  with  software  improvements  and  better  controls  and
displays based on feedback that we receive from operational deployments.

The Cargo Advanced Automated Radiography System (CAARS) will automatically
detect  high-density  material  shielded  within  cargo  that  could  escape  detection  by
passive  radiation  systems,  like  ASP.  The  automated  image  processing  techniques
envisioned  for  CAARS  will  also  substantially  improve  throughput  rates  over  cur-
rent-generation radiography systems. DNDO awarded contracts to L–3 Communica-
tions,  American  Science  and  Engineering,  Incorporated,  and  SAIC  for  the  develop-
ment of CAARS last September.

Development  of  these  technologies  will  continue  in  FY  2008,  with  a  projected  de-
livery  of  prototype  units  in  mid-2009.  Once  ready,  these  systems  will  be  subjected
to a rigorous test program to evaluate the technology and to enter into engineering
development. Test results will serve as a major factor in evaluating the performance
of  the  three  contractors  and  continuing  with  the  next  phase  of  the  program,  in
which  low-rate  initial  production  will  begin.  DNDO  will  also  begin  preparations  for
pilot  deployments  to  evaluate  operational  factors  and  conduct  other  deployment
planning efforts such as site surveys and environmental impact assessments.

Nevertheless,  ASP  and  CAARS  deployed  at  our  official  POEs  are  not  the  only
technologies  needed  to  fulfill  our  nuclear  detection  architecture.  The  DNDO  is  also
working  on  Human  Portable  Radiation  Detection  Systems,  or  HPRDS,  that  aim  to
improve  on  current  hand-held  and  backpack  radiation  detection  systems  similar  to
those currently used by Customs Border and Protection (CBP) and the Coast Guard.
These  systems  currently  weigh  ten  to  25  pounds,  and  are  generally  operated  as  a
secondary  screening  tool.  When  an  alarm  is  detected,  hand-held  systems  can  then
be  used  to  isolate  and  identify  the  source  of  the  radiation.  The  HPRDS  program
seeks  to  reduce  the  weight  of  systems  to  approximately  five  pounds,  while  simulta-
neously improving detection probabilities to as high as 90 percent when used in ter-
tiary  or  confirmatory  inspection  applications;  and  also  improve  connectivity  for
alarm  reporting  and  technical  support.  In  October,  five  companies  received
awards—Smiths Detection, SAIC, Ortec, Sanmina-SCI, and Target Instruments.

In  FY  2008,  development  efforts  for  the  next  generation  of  hand-helds  and
backpacks will focus on: improving the identification capabilities of human portable
systems so they can distinguish between threat and non-threat material quicker and
with  greater  accuracy;  standardizing  the  displays  and  control  functions  to  improve
system  operability  for  field  operators;  reducing  the  weight  of  units  so  they  are  less
burdensome to use; and improving systems connectivity so that data can be rapidly
communicated and analyzed to determine if it represents a potential threat.
Long-Term Transformational R&D Priorities

Despite  the  progression  of  our  near-term  R&D  efforts,  there  are  still  key,  long-
term  challenges  and  vulnerabilities  in  our  detection  architecture  that  require  long-
range, higher-risk research programs to deliver the highest payoff improvements in
detection  capabilities.  One  of  the  primary  motives  for  the  establishment  of  the
DNDO  was  to  create  a  mechanism  for  significant  and  sustained  funding  into  radi-
ation  detection  technologies  through  innovative  approaches.  Our  transformational
R&D program works with all sectors—National Laboratories, academia, and private
industry—to seek dramatic technical improvements.

This  is  not  research  for  the  sake  of  research.  This  is  a  deliberate,  focused  effort
to  address  significant  capability  gaps  in  our  present  detection  architecture—gaps
that  cannot  be  filled  with  current  technologies  because  of  performance  issues,  cost,
or lack of capability. Revolutionary advances in radiation detection technology could
potentially  impact  all  capability  gaps  in  our  present  detection  architecture,  from  a
distributed  network  of  inexpensive  radiation  detectors  to  highly  sensitive,  standoff
detection  systems  for  sensing  mobile  threats  at  speed.  Many  of  these  technical
breakthroughs  would  directly  address  some  of  the  opportunities  and  challenges  I
mentioned before, such as general aviation, small maritime craft, non-POE land bor-
der crossings, and State and local operations.

Our  transformational  research  includes  a  robust  Exploratory  Research  Program,
a  dedicated  Academic  Research  Initiative,  and  several  upcoming  Advanced  Tech-
nology  Demonstrations  (ATDs).  Exploratory  Research  focuses  on  technical  solutions
that  are  at  the  feasibility  phase  and  show  significant  promise,  but  require  further
concept  development  and  demonstration.  As  solutions  and  concepts  mature,  tech-
nologies  will  transition  either  into  enabling  components  for  existing  ATDs  or  will
generate new ATD initiatives. The purpose of an ATD is to develop and test a device
and  generate  the  data  needed  to  perform  a  preliminary  cost-benefit  analysis  for  a

technology.  Successful  research  originating  from  our  Academic  Research  Initiative
will also transition to exploratory research or an ATD initiative.

In December 2005, DNDO published a Call for Proposals to the National Labora-
tories soliciting novel detection approaches, materials, and advanced technologies as
part of our Exploratory Research program. DNDO received more than 150 proposals,
and  ultimately  selected  44  for  award,  resulting  in  nearly  $40  million  in  research
programs.  Similarly,  DNDO  released  a  solicitation  for  private  industry  and  aca-
demia proposals in the same research topics. More than 200 white papers were sub-
mitted,  and  last  month  we  announced  the  award  of  seven  cooperative  agreements
with academia totaling approximately $3.1 million. The research topics of these uni-
versities include advances in materials, associated electronics, detection techniques,
and enabling technologies to investigate and understand important and related phe-
nomenology.

In FY 2008, exploratory research topics will include: new materials that have high
energy  resolution,  high  efficiency,  and  low  cost;  shielded  special  nuclear  material
(SNM)  verification  efforts  that  would  enable  highly  penetrating,  efficient,  low-dose
interrogation  systems  to  address  screening  of  general  aviation,  small  boats,  and  oc-
cupied vehicles; new solutions for passive detection of SNM in general aviation, com-
mercial air cargo, and boats and small ships near the U.S. coastline; and technology
and  concepts  that  offer  significantly  enhanced  threat  sensitivity  with  remote  and
distributed  emplaced  sensor  networks.  In  addition,  we  will  be  working  with  the
DHS  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  to  examine  techniques  for  integrating  ex-
plosives detection with radiological and nuclear detection, achieving single-device so-
lutions.

Our ATD program takes leading edge technological concepts (in many cases tech-
nology  demonstrated  conceptually  under  Exploratory  Research)  and  develops  a  per-
formance  test  unit  to  conduct  a  realistic  demonstration  of  capabilities.  The  results
of  the  tests  form  the  basis  for  a  preliminary  cost  benefit  analysis  that  is  used  to
objectively  determine  whether  the  technology  should  transition  to  our  Systems  De-
velopment and Acquisition program.

In FY 2008, the Intelligence Personal Radiation Locator (IPRL) ATD that started
in  2006  will  result  in  a  performance  test  unit  that  will  be  ready  for  testing.  The
IPRL  emerged  from  an  end-user  requirement  for  a  next-generation  personal  radi-
ation  detection  system  similar  to  the  radiation  pagers  often  used  by  CBP,  first  re-
sponders, and law enforcement officials. IPRL will have sufficient energy resolution
and  sensitivity  to  reliably  discriminate  between  NORM,  background,  and  potential
threats, and will be used by law enforcement, first responder, counterterrorism, the
intelligence  community  and  others  in  routine  activities  and  surveillance.  DNDO
awarded  contracts  worth  up  to  $22M  for  the  IPRL  program  last  September.  This
enabled us to conduct the design and development work required to take IPRL from
the  conceptual  phase  and  become  ready  for  testing  of  IPRL  performance  test  units
in early FY 2009.

In  addition,  our  Standoff  Detection  ATD  will  be  ready  for  final  system  design  re-
view, with a mid-FY 2009 target for testing of the performance test units. This ATD
will  allow  DNDO  to  develop  and  evaluate  key  existing  technologies  such  as  coded
aperture  and  Compton  imaging  that  may  dramatically  improve  sensitivity  and  di-
rectional accuracy. Our goal is to extend nuclear detection ranges to as much as 100
meters, potentially providing the capability to locate and identify nuclear threat ma-
terials  at  greater  distances  for  use  in  ground-based,  airborne,  and  maritime  plat-
forms.  Defense  Threat  Reduction  Agency  (DTRA)  and  the  Department  of  Defense
(DOD) also have strong requirements for long standoff capability for detection of nu-
clear  materials.  To  de-conflict  our  programs,  DTRA  cites  the  need  for  very  long
standoff  detection  of  one  kilometer  (1000  meters)  or  more.  Since  in  most  cases  the
goal of 100 meters is unattainable with current technologies, DTRA’s current efforts
are  closely  related  to  those  of  DNDO.  Achieving  our  shared  goal  to  improve  capa-
bility for longer standoff detection will require the resources of both DHS and DOD.
Our  Verification  of  Shielded  SNM  ATD  is  scheduled  for  preliminary  design  re-
views  in  early  FY  2009,  with  final  system  design  review  expected  in  late  FY  2009.
This  ATD  will  develop  and  test  advanced  technology  to  resolve  alarms  and  defini-
tively  verify  the  presence  of  SNM  despite  cluttered  environments  or  intentional
countermeasures  like  shielding.  Furthermore,  another  embodiment  of  this  tech-
nology  may  lead  to  a  whole  new  capability  for  portable  interrogation  systems  that
will  enable  relocatable  or  human  portable  detection  systems  that  can  automatically
verify the presence of shielded SNM.

The final component of our transformational R&D program provides a much need-
ed emphasis in nuclear detection sciences, a field that has been in decline at Amer-
ican  universities  for  years.  A  survey  by  the  National  Science  Foundation  showed  a
downward trend since the mid-1990s of nuclear scientists and engineers of approxi-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 Jun 11, 2007 Jkt 033611 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\T&I07\030807\33611 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

mately  60  per  year.  In  1980,  there  were  65  nuclear  engineering  departments  ac-
tively operating in the U.S. universities; now there are only 29. Currently, it is esti-
mated  that  one-third  to  three-quarters  of  the  current  nuclear  workforce  will  reach
retirement  in  the  next  10  years.  The  future  security  of  our  nation  requires  such  a
rejuvenation  effort  at  our  universities.  The  current  projections  forecast  a  need  for
approximately 100 new Ph.D.s per year.

DNDO’s  Academic  Research  Initiative  will  spur  the  academic  community  to  pro-
vide  the  nuclear  detection  experts  of  the  future  by  funding  universities  to  conduct
R&D in areas relevant to the detection of nuclear and radiological material. In addi-
tion,  the  program  will  foster  potentially  high-risk  but  high-payoff  ideas  that  could
lead to solutions that have not yet been considered. Last month, DNDO and the Na-
tional  Science  Foundation  announced  grant  opportunities  worth  up  to  $58  million
over  the  next  five  years  for  colleges  and  universities.  Once  this  program  matures,
our estimate is that this initiative will produce 20 to 30 new Ph.D.s per year, while
also  addressing  critical  research  needs.  This  will  not  address  the  need  completely.
But our efforts, combined with the academic support efforts of other federal agencies
like  the  Department  of  Energy,  will  help  provide  the  nuclear  scientists  and  engi-
neers of the future.
Coordination of Effort

The  identification  of  gaps  in  nuclear  detection  capabilities  justifies  the  need  for
a  well-supported  DNDO  research  and  development  program.  At  the  same  time,  we
recognize that several federal agencies already engage in research and development
in  this  area.  Therefore,  the  planning  process  for  the  DNDO  transformational  re-
search  agenda  was  coordinated  with  partners,  including  the  DOE  National  Nuclear
Security  Administration’s  Nonproliferation  and  Verification  Research  and  Develop-
ment Program (NA–22), the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and the Of-
fice  of  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  (DNI).  I  would  like  to  take  a  moment
to  describe  several  mechanisms  currently  in  place  to  ensure  active  coordination  be-
tween DNDO and other agencies funding related research and development.

From its founding, DNDO supported the Domestic Nuclear Defense Research and
Development (DND R&D) Roadmap Working Group to develop a coordinated, inter-
agency  R&D  roadmap  that  would  enhance  the  breadth  of  domestic  nuclear  defense
efforts  to  ensure  a  secure  nation.  The  DND  R&D  Working  Group  was  chartered  by
the Homeland Security Council/National Security Council Domestic Nuclear Defense
(DND) Policy Coordinating Committee. The DND R&D Roadmap Working Group de-
veloped  a  long-term  vision  for  domestic  nuclear  defense  R&D.  The  scope  of  this
working group covered the interagency coordination of: R&D strategies for domestic
nuclear  defense;  the  identification  and  filling  of  critical  technology  gaps;  enhancing
efforts  to  develop  and  sustain  critical  capabilities  through  appropriate  investments
in  the  foundational  science  and  research;  interagency  funding  for  necessary  science
and  technology;  and  collaboration  and  exchange  of  vital  R&D  information.  DNDO
co-chairs the working group on interdiction research and development.

DNDO  has  also  supported  the  National  Nuclear  Security  Administration  in  re-
viewing  foundational  science  proposals  for  advanced  detectors  and  materials.  Staff
from both NA–22 and DNDO served on each others’ proposal review panels, in part
to  ensure  that  duplication  of  funding  is  minimized.  This  interaction  helped  ensure
that DNDO transformational R&D programs are well coordinated with those of NA–
22 (which focused on foundational science for advanced detectors and materials), en-
abling  the  U.S.  Government  to  best  utilize  the  expertise  of  the  National  Labs.
DNDO conducted similar proposal reviews with DTRA.

DNDO,  as  an  interagency  office,  has  full-time  detailees  from  agencies  such  as
DOE and DOD. These individuals have provided invaluable expertise in all aspects
of  the  DNDO  mission.  Our  detailees  enable  us  to  maintain  an  open  and  productive
dialogue  with  our  interagency  partners  so  that  we  can  avoid  duplication  of  effort
and make strides toward the complete implementation of the proposed architecture.
Conclusion

The challenges that lie ahead require a coordinated effort on the behalf of the best
scientific  minds  within  our  government,  academia  and  the  private  sector.  The
DNDO has taken an end-to-end approach to research and development, systems de-
velopment,  and  product  improvement.  From  fostering  the  development  of  revolu-
tionary detection technologies that fill gaps in our evolving architecture to providing
next-generation technologies that improve performance, cost, and operational value,
DNDO  is  working  to  provide  the  Nation  with  a  continuously  improving  capability
to protect against a terrorist nuclear attack.

This  concludes  my  prepared  statement.  With  the  Committee’s  permission,  I  re-
quest  my  formal  statement  be  submitted  for  the  record.  Chairman  Wu,  Ranking

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  GERALD  L.  EPSTEIN,  SENIOR  FELLOW
FOR  SCIENCE  AND  SECURITY,  HOMELAND  SECURITY  PRO-
GRAM,  CENTER  FOR  STRATEGIC  AND  INTERNATIONAL
STUDIES
Dr.  EPSTEIN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Member
Gingrey, and Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the op-
portunity to speak with you this morning.

Before I start, I can’t help but point out that I first started study-
ing the issues I am going to be talking with you about this morning
working  for  this  institution  in  an  agency  that  unfortunately  no
longer  exists.  I  used  to  be  with  the  Congressional  Office  of  Tech-
nology Assessment and wrote a report on the same things we have
been  talking  about.  And  as  much  as  I  welcome  the  opportunity  to
speak  with  you  today,  frankly,  you  deserve  better  than  that.  You
deserve  better  than  one  hearing  with  individual  witnesses.  You
need  your  own  folks,  a  dedicated  office  working  on  precisely  the
interface  of  technology  and  policy,  not  just  for  this  committee  but
for  practically  every  other  committee  on  the  Hill.  So  let  me  just
command  that  I  think  that  is  a  capability  that  could  be  used  here
on the Hill.

Let me get back to what you asked me to talk about. I would like
to  start  off  by  highlighting  just  one  or  two  factors  I  think  we  need
to  keep  in  mind  when  we  address  Homeland  Security  Science  and
Technology, make a few observations along with way about the fis-
cal year 2008 request from the Department, and then end up with
one  specific  point  on  what  has  turned  out  to  be  a  popular  issue,
that of Science and Technology education.

Let me start with I think the greatest challenge we face in man-
aging  an  R&D  portfolio  for  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security,
which  is  looking  over  the  entire  menu  of  risks  that  are  in  front  of
us  and  deciding  what  it  is  we  actually  need  to  spend  our  money
on.  This  forces  us  to  compare  some  very  different  threats;  nuclear

threats, biological threats, infrastructure, explosives, borders, cyber
attacks, and all this fortunately in the absence of much of the data
you  would  really  want  to  do  a  quantitative  risk  assessment.  These
attacks  have  not  happened  much  to  date.  We  would  like  to  keep
it that way. But I think we need better tools, better analytical pro-
cedures, better processes to figure out how we actually make some
of these high-level tradeoffs.

Before  we  say,  before  I  spend  a  lot  of  money  on  this  capability,
which I might know how to do, what else might I be able to spend
it  on,  and  what  more  security  could  we  get  for  that?  I  don’t  think
there  is  going  to  be  a  magic  spreadsheet  that  is  going  to  come  up
with  the  right  allocation  among  different  priorities,  but  I  do  think
we  can  have  systems  that  are  going  to  help  make  our  decisions  a
little  more  transparent  and  highlight  where  it  is  that  our  gut
hunches,  our  subjective  probabilities  really  are  making  a  big  dif-
ference.

I would also like to talk about the time horizon of S&T research
in  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security.  When  the  Department
was first formed, the government had just realized it had this mis-
sion.  There  was  not  a  long-standing  base  of  work  precisely  on
homeland  security  type  issues.  There  were  a  lot  of  immediate
needs,  a  lot  of  immediate  capabilities  that  could  fill  those  needs,
and the decision made at the time to go for what I think has been
called  the  low-hanging  fruit,  near-term  research,  but  to  defer  the
more  basic  and  the  longer-term  investigations.  That  is  an  under-
standable  decision  at  the  time,  but  it  is  not  sustainable.  And  I  am
pleased  to  see  looking  through  this  year’s  budget  request  that  we
have  a  more  balanced  portfolio  of  research  and  development,  not
just  near-term  programs  but  also  longer-term  programs,  and  I  am
particularly  pleased  to  see  that  we  are  willing  to  take  some  risks.
And that is essential.

A  serious  pathology  that  a  technology  development  organization
can  run  into,  especially  one  that  has  to  look  at  emerging  techno-
logical  threats,  is  to  aim  too  low.  Under  Secretary  Cohen  is  going
to need your help in making sure he is not running into this prob-
lem,  making  sure  his  vision  is  far  enough.  The  way  you  will  know
he  is  doing  his  job  is  if  he  can  come  back  to  you  and  report  that
he  has  failed.  If  he  hasn’t  started  some  programs  that  just  don’t
pan out, he is not being aggressive enough, and I think he can use
your help in holding him to that.

And I would just now like to conclude on a note about the Home-
land  Security  Science  and  Technology  Fellows  Program.  This  is  an
important  program.  I  am  pleased  that  the  Department  recognizes
the  importance  of  a  strong  national  Science  and  Technology  base,
not just for the many other objectives that we draw on S&T for but
particularly for the Department of Homeland Security mission. And
the  Department  recognizes  this  responsibility  to  replenishing  the
supply  of  human  resources  in  this  arena.  But  I  think  the  program
actually  could  probably  be  modified  so  that  the  fellows  not  only
contribute  in  general  to  the  U.S.  science  and  technology  base  but
contribute  specifically  to  Homeland  Security  missions.  And  this  is
not by making more requirements on the program but actually get-
ting  them  more  excited  about  homeland  security  and  the  tech-
nology applications that they can work on that are solving our own

needs.  I  think  a  deeper  engagement  with  these  fellows,  they  now
have  an  orientation  at  the  beginning  of  the  process  and  they  work
on  an  internship,  I  think  a  continuing  involvement,  high-level
mentorships,  briefing  them  on  threats  facing  the  Nation  and  the
different  ways  in  which  the  whole  Homeland  Security  architecture
can  address  it  will  get  them  excited,  not  only  about  their  own
science  and  technology  investigations,  but  about  applying  that  to
the homeland security mission.

And,  again,  we  need  S&T  workforce  in  this  country,  but  the
homeland  security  agencies  have  a  harder  job.  They  have  got  to
work  with  the  U.S.  citizens.  We  are  fortunate  to  have  foreign  na-
tionals  contribute  to  the  technical  workforce  in  this  country,  but
they can’t get security clearances, and they can’t work for the gen-
tleman on my right. So the programs they are supporting are very
important,  and  I  think  they  can  have  a  higher  payoff  in  having
them work directly for the Homeland Security sector.

So  I  would  be  glad  to  entertain  your  questions  at  the  end  of  the

panel.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Epstein follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF GERALD L. EPSTEIN

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:

I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the Department
of  Homeland  Security’s  Science  and  Technology  Budget  for  Fiscal  Year  2008.  I  am
currently  serving  as  Senior  Fellow  in  Science  and  Security  in  the  Homeland  Secu-
rity  Program  at  the  Center  for  Strategic  and  International  Studies  (CSIS),  here  in
Washington. I am also an Adjunct Professor at Georgetown University’s Edmund A.
Walsh School of Foreign Service, where I teach a course on science, technology and
homeland security. I have been working in the area of science, technology, and secu-
rity  policy  for  more  than  twenty  years  and  have  been  studying  nuclear,  chemical,
biological, and radiological weapons issues and responses for over 15 years.1

At  CSIS,  my  colleagues  and  I  are  involved  in  a  major  international  effort,  sup-
ported  by  the  Carnegie  Corporation  of  New  York  and  the  John  D.  and  Catherine
T. MacArthur Foundation, to take a comprehensive, international, and interdiscipli-
nary  approach  to  dissuading,  interdicting,  mitigating,  and  responding  to  biological
weapons threats. This project aims to improve the ability to counter these weapons
at  all  stages,  from  influencing  the  intent  to  produce  weapons,  to  denying  access  to
materials and expertise, to detecting illicit programs, to managing the consequences
of  an  attack.  The  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s  Science  and  Technology  pro-
gram, and particularly its biological defense programs, are an important part of the
United States’—and the world’s—response to these threats.2
Other Sources of Advice to Congress

Before  I  start,  however,  I  cannot  help  pointing  out  to  this  committee  that  I  first
started working on the issues I will be discussing today at an agency that no longer
exists—the  Congressional  Office  of  Technology  Assessment.  At  OTA  I  was  the
Project  Director  for  a  major  series  of  reports  produced  for  the  Congress  on  the  pro-
liferation of weapons of mass destruction, including biological weapons. As much as
I  welcome  the  opportunity  to  discuss  these  issues  with  Members  of  this  committee
this morning, frankly you and your colleagues deserve more attention than I or any
other  outside  witnesses  can  devote  to  you  in  one  hearing.  You  need  a  dedicated,
credible,  and  authoritative  body  of  substantive  experts,  working  for  you  within  a
carefully  structured  and  fully  bipartisan  process,  that  can  relate  the  best  available
technical understanding directly to the policy choices you face. I have long believed
that  you  and  your  colleagues—who  must  act  on  policy  issues  that  are  inextricably
dependent  on  science  and  technology  in  practically  every  Committee  of  Congress—
would find such a capability to be very helpful.

1 None of the institutions I am affiliated with take policy positions on the topics I will discuss,

and the views expressed are strictly my own.

Homeland Security Science and Technology Challenges

What  we  now  call  ‘‘homeland  security’’  has  only  been  recognized  as  a  mission  of
the  Federal  Government  since  the  late  1990s,  and  only  since  9/11  has  it  acquired
the  resources  and  organization  it  has  today.  Previously,  national  security  policy
dealt primarily with overseas threats, and domestic policy did not have a major se-
curity  component.  The  U.S.  National  Academy  of  Sciences’  landmark  2002  study
Making the Nation Safer3 recognized the vital role that science and technology could
play  in  bolstering  our  homeland  security,  and  this  report  played  a  significant  role
in the establishment of a Directorate of Science and Technology within the new De-
partment of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2003. Given both the importance of apply-
ing  science  and  technology  to  this  new  mission  and  the  paucity  of  previous  govern-
ment efforts to do so, the DHS S&T Directorate was one of the few parts of the new
Department to receive a substantial infusion of new funding; most of the rest of the
Department  consisted  of  agencies  whose  staffs,  budgets,  and  missions  were  trans-
ferred (either whole or in part) from elsewhere in government.

The  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s  Fiscal  Year  2008  budget  request  marks
only  the  fourth  one  that  has  been  prepared  by  the  Department  itself,  as  opposed
to  its  various  predecessor  agencies,  and  applying  science  and  technology  to  the
homeland security mission continues to pose challenges:

1. Military  technology  is  not  directly  applicable  to  homeland  security.  Although
the  military  has  considerable  experience  in  developing  and  fielding  tech-
nologies  that  are  relevant  to  homeland  security  needs  (such  as  detecting
chemical and biological agents), few military systems can be directly adopted
in a homeland security context. Military and civil users differ in their threat
scenarios;  levels  of  user  skill,  experience,  and  training;  systems  for  mainte-
nance,  logistics,  and  self-protection;  sources  of  funding;  willingness  to  tol-
erate  disruption;  ability  to  issue  orders;  and  respective  legal  and  policy  con-
texts  in  ways  that  make  it  very  difficult  to  use  military  systems  for  home-
land  security  purposes.  The  independent  existence  of  a  DHS  Science  and
Technology program is an acknowledgment of this fact.

2. Users  of  homeland  security  technologies  may  not  be  federal  employees.  Many
individuals responsible for mitigating, defending against, or dealing with ter-
rorist  attacks  in  the  United  States—e.g.,  police  officers,  emergency  medical
technicians, subway train operators, operators of critical infrastructures—are
not  federal  employees  at  all.  They  work  for  State,  local,  and  tribal  govern-
ments  or  for  the  private  sector,  often  in  organizations  that  buy  equipment
‘‘off  the  shelf’’  and  that  have  little  experience  in  developing  their  own  sys-
tems.  They  may  even  be  members  of  the  public  attempting  to  protect  them-
selves.  These  users  tend  to  be  highly  disaggregated,  and  they  may  not  have
their own funding to purchase and field new technologies.

3. Users may not even exist yet. Some key missions of interest to the DHS S&T
directorate—including detection of pathogenic biological organisms in the at-
mosphere,  decontamination  of  wide  areas  after  a  major  biological  attack,  or
detection  of  smuggled  nuclear  weapons  in  commercial  shipping—were  no-
body’s  responsibility  prior  to  the  creation  of  DHS.  Moreover,  technological
breakthroughs can provide capabilities that had never been anticipated, and
that  no  institution  or  entity  may  currently  be  in  a  position  to  utilize.  Al-
though  developing  technology  without  a  clear  sense  of  what  is  needed  risks
wasting  time  and  money,  tying  R&D  programs  exclusively  to  the  identified
needs of established users can impede our ability to utilize ‘‘game-changing’’
breakthroughs.  Sufficiently  powerful  tools  should  motivate  us  to  figure  out
how to use them.

4. Technologies don’t protect us—systems do. Throwing technology at a problem
does  not  necessarily  make  us  safer.  Careful  studies  are  needed  to  identify
systems  and  concepts  of  operations  that  will  mitigate,  dissuade,  expose,  or
respond to threats; model how effectively these systems will work in different
situations; ask how the deployment of such systems might change the nature
of  the  threat;  and  evaluate  how  much  better  off  such  a  system,  on  balance,
will  make  us.  Moreover,  the  political  leaders  who  will  oversee  the  use  of
these systems need to become familiar with their capabilities and their limi-
tations.

5. Prioritization is, and will remain, difficult. Perhaps the hardest job in devel-
oping  homeland  security  technologies  is  determining  which  threats  to  ad-
dress,  deciding  how  much  to  spend  on  countering  each,  and  measuring  our
progress.  Major  terrorist  attacks  are  fortunately  rare,  and  we  do  not  have
an exhaustive database of prior attacks that will let us predict what the next
attacks  will  look  like.  Moreover,  tracking  terrorist  plans  and  capabilities  is
much  more  difficult,  say,  than  counting  Soviet  armored  divisions  or  inter-
continental ballistic missiles was. Modeling and systems studies can provide
some  guidance  in  allocating  our  defensive  dollars,  but  they  can  be  very  sen-
sitive to assumptions that will be impossible to justify empirically. Improving
our  methodologies  for  such  decision-making  should  itself  be  a  high  priority,
even if in the end, decision-makers will have to rely on subjective judgment.
6. No magic organizational solution can eliminate inherent overlap among agen-
cy  missions,  such  as  those  of  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  and  the
Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (HHS).  DHS  deals  with  delib-
erate  attacks,  including  those  involving  biological  agents  and  disease.  HHS
deals  with  health  and  disease  threats,  including  those  involving  deliberate
attack.  Biological  attacks  are  both  health  incidents  and  security  incidents,
and both DHS and HHS must be involved in countering them. The potential
for  conflict  can  never  be  eliminated,  but  it  can  be  managed—particularly
through open lines of communication, clear delineation of roles and missions,
and  an  awareness  of  the  different  contexts  in  which  each  agency  views  this
issue.

Biodefense in the FY 2008 DHS Science and Technology Budget

The largest component of the DHS S&T Directorate’s budget is the Chemical and
Biological  Division,  which  I  was  asked  to  address  in  my  testimony.  Overall  federal
responsibilities  for  biodefense  and  biosecurity  have  been  specified  in  policy  docu-
ments  such  as  Homeland  Security  Presidential  Directives  HSPD–9  (‘‘Defense  of
United  States  Agriculture  and  Food,’’),  HSPD–10  (‘‘Biodefense  for  the  Twenty-First
Century’’), and HSPD–18 (‘‘Medical Countermeasures against Weapons of Mass De-
struction’’), which in turn have generated taskings for the Department of Homeland
Security.  A  few  aspects  of  the  Department’s  biological  research  and  technology  de-
velopment program merit particular attention.

Prioritization.  As  indicated  above,  one  of  the  key  management  challenges  facing
those responsible for developing and deploying homeland security technologies is es-
tablishing  priorities.  At  the  operational  level,  this  process  would  consist  of  identi-
fying  performance  or  readiness  goals  that  characterize  the  capabilities  we  need  to
achieve; measuring how far we are from those goals; and deriving a set of programs
(including acquisition, technology development, training and doctrine, etc.) that will
close those gaps. This process would also require some way of evaluating which gaps
were most important to close, and which programs would be most effective in closing
them. Such a process would involve all agencies that had homeland security respon-
sibilities, and it would be updated regularly.

The  National  Academies’  study  Making  the  Nation  Safer  stated  that  the  govern-
ment  did  not  have  the  analytic  capabilities  it  needed  to  inform  decision-making,4
and it called for such capabilities to be created. That work is incomplete. Even with
better tools, however, I believe that assessing risk, setting priorities, and measuring
progress will be a very difficult job—one that is harder than the equivalent planning
process  in  the  Department  of  Defense,  since  homeland  security  vulnerabilities  are
more diverse and the threats against them harder to evaluate. In the end, however,
dollars have to be spent on some things and not on others, and those choices should
be informed by analysis to the greatest extent possible.

Biowatch  and  the  Office  of  Health  Affairs.  The  transfer  of  operational  responsi-
bility  for  the  Biowatch  system  into  the  new  Office  of  Health  Affairs  for  FY  2008
budget is a promising development.

The  Biowatch  system,  which  samples  air  in  a  number  of  metropolitan  areas  for
the presence of specific biological threat agents, is an example of a system that was
deployed before it had true users. We had never had the ability to respond to a bio-
terrorist  attack  on  a  U.S.  city  in  ‘‘near  real  time’’—as  or  shortly  after  the  agents
were  released—and  it  was  therefore  nobody’s  job  to  look  for  attacks  on  that
timescale.  Nevertheless,  the  motivation  for  the  Biowatch  system  is  compelling—to
provide  sufficient  warning  to  initiate  the  distribution  of  medical  countermeasures

before  illnesses  start  to  manifest,  when  those  countermeasures  can  be  far  more  ef-
fective.

The  combination  of  a  compelling  technical  rationale  with  the  lack  of  an  obvious
user  meant  that  the  early  deployment  of  this  system  outpaced  the  development  of
response  protocols  that  involved  all  the  local,  State,  federal,  and  non-governmental
entities  that  would  have  some  role  in  responding  to  a  true  attack.  In  subsequent
years,  as  we  have  gained  experience  operating  this  system,  additional  work  has
been  done  to  incorporate  Biowatch  information  more  effectively  into  response  plan-
ning  and  decision-making.  Even  so,  it  remains  an  open  question  whether  or  not
Biowatch will be able to provide early confirmation of a biological attack with a level
of confidence that is high enough for public officials to take highly consequential ac-
tions such as community-wide distribution of medication.

Exploration  of  these  essential  systems  issues  will  be  advanced  by  the  transfer  of
operational  responsibility  for  running  the  Biowatch  system  from  the  DHS  Science
and  Technology  Directorate  to  the  new  DHS  Office  of  Health  Affairs.  The  S&T  Di-
rectorate would retain responsibility for technical improvement and next-generation
systems.  This  transfer  for  the  first  time  identifies  a  principal  federal  ‘‘user’’  for  the
Biowatch system, albeit a surrogate one. The Office of Health Affairs does not itself
mount  the  full  response  to  a  biological  attack,  but  it  does  have  the  responsibility
to  work  with  actual  responding  agencies  at  many  different  levels  of  government  to
ensure that the Biowatch capability is effectively utilized. Clarifying operational and
research responsibilities for the Biowatch system is a positive step that will improve
both the technical prospects and the operational confidence of the system.

Technically,  Biowatch  has  been  highly  successful.  I  would  never  have  predicted
that  over  two  million  Biowatch  assays  would  have  been  processed  by  now  without
any  false  alarms.  This  is  a  very  impressive  record  that  helps  to  build  confidence  in
the system. At the same time, we have seen a number of ‘‘true positives’’—the detec-
tion  of  actual  threat  agents  in  city  air  samples.  In  each  case,  these  detections  have
been attributed to organisms that occurred naturally in the environment, and none
of these detections resulted in mobilizing a full response to a fictitious attack. These
detections  therefore  served  to  validate  the  system  hardware  and  analysis  protocols,
and they also proved that our response protocols did not incorrectly assume a detec-
tion always meant an attack.

On  the  other  hand,  the  fact  that  Biowatch  alarms  had  to  be  confirmed  by  actual
cases  of  disease  before  a  full  response  would  have  been  mounted  does  raise  the
question of what the added value of the Biowatch system is. (Note that the response
to  an  alarm  might  have  been  different  for  an  agent  such  as  smallpox,  which  is  not
found in nature, for which confirmed laboratory detection would be impossible to at-
tribute  to  natural  causes.)  As  we  continue  to  gain  operational  experience  with
Biowatch,  it  will  be  essential  for  the  Office  of  Health  Affairs  to  evaluate  the  ways
in which Biowatch warning information can prove useful, even if it is not sufficient
to trigger a full response. Possible uses of such information include heightening our
sensitivity  to  look  for  individual  cases  of  disease,  triggering  some  initial  stages  of
pharmaceutical distribution, or informing subsequent determination of the scale and
scope of a biological attack.

Relationships  Between  DHS  and  Other  Governmental  Agencies.  As  described
above, there is no organizational solution that will eliminate the potential for inter-
agency conflict or confusion over biodefense. As we are exploring at CSIS in our Bio-
logical Threat Reduction project, interactions between different professional commu-
nities—embodied in the U.S. Government by different government agencies—are an
essential  aspect  of  any  response  to  biological  threats.  Although  these  interactions
will  always  present  challenges,  I  believe  that  the  Departments  of  Homeland  Secu-
rity  and  Health  and  Human  Services  are  developing  appropriate  mechanisms  for
working together.

In  the  current  fiscal  year—pending  appropriations—and  certainly  in  the  coming
year,  a  new  agency  in  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  will  appear
on  the  scene  with  a  vitally  important  role  in  biodefense:  the  Biomedical  Advanced
Research  and  Development  Authority,  or  BARDA.  With  the  mission  of  bridging  the
gap  between  basic  biomedical  research  and  countermeasure  procurement,  BARDA
will  play  an  essential  role  in  building  the  Nation’s  capacity  to  respond  to  biological
attack.  But  in  addition  to  facilitating  the  development  of  specific  countermeasures,
BARDA will have an additional mission that may prove even more important in the
long  run—that  of  promoting  innovative  technologies  that  can  reduce  the  time  and
cost  of  countermeasure  development  in  general.  With  biotechnology  becoming  ever
more  powerful  and  more  widely  available,  we  will  be  less  and  less  able  to  restrict
our attention in the future to a short list of threat agents, each with its own lengthy
and expensive countermeasure program.

Instead,  we  have  to  move  towards  a  flexible,  adaptive,  and  responsive  biodefense
system  capable  of  dealing  with  threats  in  near-real-time.  Creating  such  a  system
will  blur  the  distinctions  between  environmental  detection,  medical  diagnosis,  pro-
phylaxis,  and  treatment,  making  it  even  more  important  for  the  Departments  of
Homeland  Security  and  Health  and  Human  Services—whose  mission  delineations
currently  depend  on  some  of  these  functional  boundaries—to  work  together  effec-
tively.  These  departments  will  also  need  to  work  with  the  Department  of  Defense,
whose  Transformational  Medical  Technologies  Initiative,  funded  by  the  Defense
Threat  Reduction  Agency,  also  works  to  shorten  and  simplify  medical  counter-
measure development.

Time and Risk Horizon of DHS Research. When the Department of Homeland Se-
curity’s  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  was  first  formed,  there  were  so  many
immediate  demands  for  science  and  technology  that  longer-term  research  was  con-
sidered  an  unaffordable  luxury.  This  may  have  been  a  necessary  decision  at  the
time, but it was not a sustainable one. Failure to invest in longer-term research lim-
its  the  prospects  for  future  breakthroughs  that  could  dramatically  improve  DHS’s
ability to fulfill its mission.

As the S&T Directorate matures, so must its S&T portfolio—which means invest-
ing  in  a  portfolio  of  both  near-term  and  long-term  research.  I  understand  that  the
S&T  Directorate’s  leadership  now  shares  this  view.  I  particularly  welcome  Admiral
Cohen’s plans to fund some high-risk but potentially very high payoff projects. A se-
rious  pathology  that  can  overtake  a  technology  development  program  is  to  become
failure  intolerant,  forcing  it  to  settle  on  safe  bets  that  are  less  ambitious  than  its
mission  requires.  Admiral  Cohen  will  need  your  support  if  he  hopes  to  avoid  this—
you  will  have  to  make  sure  he  fails  often  enough,  and  to  hold  him  accountable  if
he doesn’t.

Classified  Biological  Research  and  Treaty  Compliance.  Classified  research  con-
stitutes  a  much  smaller  portion  of  the  U.S.  biodefense  program  than  many  might
suspect. The vast majority of U.S. biodefense consists of unclassified research at the
National  Institutes  of  Health,  which  dwarfs  all  Department  of  Homeland  Security
biodefense activities, let alone any classified ones. Nevertheless, classified DHS bio-
defense  research  will  constitute  one  of  the  most  controversial  parts  of  the  U.S.  bio-
defense  program.  Research  that  cannot  be  shared  with  diverse  technical  reviewers,
independent  non-governmental  observers,  or  foreign  colleagues  will  raise  questions
with respect to technical merit, policy appropriateness, and treaty compliance.

Even  more  so  than  in  other  areas  of  science,  the  biological  sciences  have  enjoyed
a tradition of openness and international collaboration—and this heavy presumption
of  openness  should  continue.  Since  disease  continues  to  kill  millions  of  people
around  the  world  each  year,  any  restrictions  on  relevant  scientific  knowledge  could
have serious consequences. Yet the existence of hostile, witting adversaries that are
determined  to  wreak  devastation  and  that  are  known  to  be  interested  in  biological
weapons mandates that this openness not be absolute. The U.S. biodefense program
would like to avoid serving as the R&D program or the targeting staff for Al Qaeda
or  any  other  terrorist  group,  even  while  it  works  to  advance  science,  cure  disease,
and assure the world that it is abiding by treaty commitments.5

Without  attempting  to  do  justice  to  the  complexity  of  this  issue,  let  me  make  a

few observations about both classification and treaty compliance:

• Actions that violate the 1975 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) also vio-
late  similarly  worded  provisions  of  U.S.  law.6 Any  government  employees  or
contractors who violated the BWC in the course of their job would be subject
to criminal prosecution.
• DHS  should  engage  in  public  outreach  to  instill  confidence  that  it  is  appro-
priately reviewing its biological research activities, including classified activi-
ties, for treaty compliance, legal compliance, and consistency with policy.
• No matter how rigorous its internal review policies are, and notwithstanding
the  involvement  of  officials  who  have  no  connection  to  the  projects  being  re-
viewed, an internal DHS compliance process will not be viewed by outside ob-
servers  as  being  truly  independent.  The  more  widely  that  DHS  activities,  in-
cluding  classified  ones,  can  be  reviewed  by  appropriately  cleared  individuals

outside  of  DHS  and  even  outside  the  U.S.  Government,  the  greater  the  con-
fidence  will  be  that  the  Department’s  activities  are  technically  sound  and
treaty compliant.

• Even  if  it  cannot  all  be  shared  with  the  public,  the  United  States  has  an  in-
terest in sharing information on its biodefense activities with other countries
to  assure  them  that  it  is  complying  with  the  Biological  Weapons  Convention.
The  fact  that  the  United  States  has  no  offensive  biological  weapons  program
should allow it to share this information more widely than if it were seeking
to protect a military advantage.

• Classified biodefense activities have been accused of triggering a ‘‘security di-
lemma’’—of  appearing  to  others  as  offensive,  and  therefore  stimulating  other
countries  to  respond  with  offensive  programs  of  their  own.7 Independent  of
the  level  of  empirical  support  for  this  proposition—there  are  certainly  exam-
ples  of  state  biological  weapons  programs  that  proceeded  in,  or  were  even
prompted  by,  the  absence  of  any  perceived  bioweapons  activities  by  their  ad-
versaries8—this argument retains at least theoretical salience as an incentive
for openness. However, it is incomplete at best. It is not clear that a country
suspecting  others  of  having  offensive  biological  weapons  programs  would
choose to respond with an offensive program of its own; a much more rational
response would be for it to improve its defenses. Even more significantly, the
argument fails utterly with respect to non-state programs. Al Qaeda’s motiva-
tion  for  pursuing  biological  weapons,  for  example,  has  absolutely  nothing  to
do with any suspicion that the United States may have an offensive program.
• The Biological Weapons Convention bans the development of biological agents
‘‘of  types  and  in  quantities  that  have  no  justification  for  prophylactic,  protec-
tive  or  other  peaceful  purposes.’’ 9 The  treaty  has  no  meaning  if  any  conceiv-
able offensive activity is justified as ‘‘protective’’ on the grounds that it is im-
portant  for  defensive  purposes  to  ‘‘see  what  is  possible.’’  Although  some  may
worry  that  classified  U.S.  biodefense  efforts  may  be  doing  just  that,  I  believe
that  the  U.S.  biodefense  program  has  too  much  to  do  to  waste  resources  on
such  unconstrained  speculation,  even  without  treaty  restrictions.  However,  I
also  believe  that  a  requirement  to  be  protective  can  be  made  operational  in
a  treaty  compliance  review.  To  justify  an  activity  as  ‘‘protective,’’  I  would
argue  that  it  should  be  shown  to  specifically  increase  our  ability  to  protect
ourselves—e.g.,  that  its  results  should  directly  and  materially  inform  par-
ticular  decisions,  or  contribute  to  particular  capabilities,  that  improve  our
ability to protect against biological weapons.

Human  Resources  for  Homeland  Security  Related  Science  and  Technology.  One
farsighted program run by the DHS Science and Technology Directorate is its Grad-
uate Fellowship program. This program is intended to support outstanding graduate
students  in  technical  disciplines  that  are  important  to  the  DHS  mission,  with  the
ultimate  objective  of  strengthening  the  Nation’s  science  and  technology  community.
However,  more  can  be  done  to  attract  these  Fellows  into  careers  in  the  homeland
security sector.

Fellows are required to attend an orientation program, to participate in a 10-week
internship,  and  to  express  willingness  to  accept  homeland  security-related  employ-
ment  after  graduation  (although  this  is  not  a  binding  obligation).  U.S.  citizenship
is required, and security clearances are required for many of the internships.

A  strengthened  S&T  community  constitutes  ‘‘a  critical  advantage  in  the  develop-
ment  and  implementation  of  counter-terrorist  measures  and  other  DHS  objectives,’’
as the Fellowship’s promotional materials explain,10 but having these Fellows enter
the  technical  community  at  large  upon  graduation  does  not  serve  the  homeland  se-
curity  mission  as  effectively  as  if  they  were  to  work  directly  in  the  homeland  secu-
rity sector. The United States scientific and technical workforce is strongly depend-
ent  on  foreign  nationals,  who  constitute  a  significant  fraction  of  each  year’s  grad-
uates in technical disciplines. Many of these highly skilled foreign nationals remain

in the United States after graduation, to this country’s great benefit.11 However, for-
eign  nationals  are  not  eligible  to  work  in  many  homeland  security-related  institu-
tions.  DHS  Graduate  Fellows  can,  and  policies  that  maximize  the  fraction  of  these
technically  trained  U.S.  citizens  who  enter  the  homeland  security  sector  would  be
very valuable.

The current program exposes Fellows to DHS problems and processes to some de-
gree, but I think that a deeper level of engagement with these Fellows, with a more
thorough  exposure  to  the  U.S.  Government’s  homeland  security  operations,  will
stimulate  greater  interest  in  pursuing  homeland  security  careers  after  graduation.
More  should  be  done  to  secure  security  clearances  for  the  Fellows  and  brief  them
on  homeland  security  threats  at  a  classified  level;  to  have  senior  representatives
from  homeland  security  and  related  agencies  (i.e.,  homeland  security,  intelligence,
defense, public health, critical infrastructure) meet with them to describe their jobs,
their  agencies’  responsibilities,  and  different  ways  in  which  science  and  technology
build  homeland  security  capabilities;  and  to  establish  mentorships  between  Fellows
and  senior  employees  in  the  homeland  security  sector.  The  Fellows  should  be  con-
vened periodically, perhaps by holding regional meetings or seminars that would be
convenient for them to attend. Ongoing engagement with the Fellows is much more
likely to elicit an interest in a career in homeland security than a single orientation.
A  model  for  such  a  program  of  continuous  engagement  and  involvement  of  tech-
nical  professionals  in  security  problems,  albeit  one  pitched  at  a  smaller  number  of
individuals  at  a  more  senior  level  in  their  career,  would  be  the  Defense  Science
Study  Group  that  is  organized  by  the  Institute  for  Defense  Analyses  for  DARPA.
I would recommend that DHS officials involved in the Graduate Fellowship Program
familiarize themselves with that activity.

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  I  thank  you  for  your  interest,

and I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have at this time.

Gerald  Epstein  is  Senior  Fellow  for  Science  and  Security  in  the  CSIS  Homeland
Security  Program,  where  he  works  on  issues  including  reducing  biological  weapons
threats,  improving  national  preparedness  to  respond  to  biological  attack,  and  ame-

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  JONAH  J.  CZERWINSKI,  MANAGING  CON-
SULTANT,  IBM  GLOBAL  BUSINESS  SERVICES;  SENIOR  FEL-
LOW,  HOMELAND  SECURITY,  IBM  GLOBAL  LEADERSHIP  INI-
TIATIVE
Mr. CZERWINSKI. Chairman Wu, Ranking Member Gingrey, Con-
gressman  Mitchell,  my  name  is  Jonah  Czerwinski.  I  am  a  senior
fellow  with  IBM’s  Global  Leadership  Initiative  and  a  managing
consultant  at  IBM’s  Global  Business  Services.  I  thank  you  for  the
opportunity  this  morning  to  appear  before  you  to  highlight  three
things.

First, IBM’s dedication to supporting basic research and services
science. Second, the investment priorities of the DHS Domestic Nu-
clear  Detection  Office,  and  the  importance  of  placing  these  efforts
in  a  broader  framework  that  protects  the  golden  flow  of  trade  and
travel.  And  third,  matching  R&D  investments  of  the  DNDO  to  the
risks posed by covert nuclear weapons and materials.

IBM  spends  approximately  $6  billion  per  year  on  research  and
development.  Much  of  it  on  basic  research.  However,  increasingly
IBM  and  others  are  also  investing  in  research  in  emerging  areas
such  as  services,  which  comprise  approximately  80  percent  of  the
U.S.  economy  and  account  for  more  than  75  percent  of  IBM’s  cor-
porate  revenues.  We  believe  that  the  national  investment  in  basic
research  remains  critical  to  foster  innovation  and  to  support  our
country’s economic competitiveness. And we advocate that the Fed-
eral  Government  also  should  support  research  and  curriculum  de-
velopment in the area of services science.

By  way  of  background  from  2004,  through  the  early  part  of  this
year I was director of Homeland Security projects at the Center for
the  Study  of  the  Presidency  and  worked  with  Center  President
David  Abshire  and  Norm  Augustine  to  organize  the  Nuclear  De-
fense Working Group. That group provided the groundwork and ra-
tionale for the Government reorganization that led to the Domestic
Nuclear Detection Office.

The challenge of nuclear material is its subtle radiological signa-
ture,  which  usually  requires  a  detector  to  be  both  close  to  the  sus-
pected source and within its vicinity for enough time to gather tell-
tale radiation. For this reason most of the investments made in de-
tecting  smuggled  nuclear  weapons  should  support  two  key  success
factors;  increasing  distance  between  the  detector  and  the  radio-
active  material  and  decreasing  dwell  time  near  the  material  itself.
The DNDO budget includes funding for certain longer-term R&D
commitments  that  show  progress  in  these  areas.  For  example,  the
development of the Advanced Standoff Detection Program that Mr.
Oxford described could become a game-changing capability. This re-
search may deliver faster detection at a greater distance.

In the end, investments like these must not only protect the pub-
lic  and  the  Nation’s  critical  assets  but  do  so  without  harming  the
flow  of  trade  and  travel.  Congress  must  view  the  effort  to  combat
the smuggled nuclear weapons threat as one of several interlocking
objectives,  many  of  which  should  benefit  from  our  R&D  invest-
ments. Doing so requires a framework that connects the search for
global,  excuse  me,  the  search  for  nuclear  materials  to  the  broader

goal of protecting the flows of cargo, people, and conveyances in the
global  trade  and  travel  system.  The  DNDO  should  figure  promi-
nently in this mission.

Ultimately,  homeland  security  R&D  investments  should  support
the broader objective of bringing efficiency, security, and resilience
to  one  of  the  most  attractive  targets  of  WMD  terrorism;  the  flow
of  global  trade  and  travel.  IBM  has  developed  a  means  by  which
today’s homeland security imperatives can reinforce both efficiency
and  security  in  the  global  movement  of  cargo,  people,  information,
and  finance.  We  call  this  framework  Global  Movement  Manage-
ment. It adds resilience to this critical system of movement without
imposing  inefficiencies  that  risk  outweighing  the  security  benefits
to  the  numerous  stakeholders  that  use  these  systems  of  trade  and
travel.  The  country  needs  a  strategic  framework  like  you  men-
tioned  to  overarch  our  R&D  investments  for  maximum  benefit  to
both  our  Homeland  Security  interests  and  our  economic  competi-
tiveness.

The  strategic  framework  is  lacking  today.  Nevertheless,  DNDO
has  chosen  successfully  several  important  pilots,  including  those  I
mentioned in my written statement.

This  leads  me  to  my  final  point.  Mr.  Chairman,  you  asked  spe-
cifically about the role of risk assessments and identifying the best
use  of  our  R&D  investments  in  this  area.  When  the  DNDO  first
was created, it was understood by its authors that as the threat of
nuclear  terrorism  and  proliferation  would  evolve,  America’s  rel-
evant  technological  base  would  evolve  and  would  other  significant
international  factors  such  as  the  war  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan.  It
was, therefore, critical that as a help for national efforts to combat
the smuggling of nuclear material, the DNDO began with a net as-
sessment  of  the  Nation’s  capabilities,  matched  against  a  current
snapshot  of  the  threat.  The  DNDO’s  Global  Nuclear  Detection  ar-
chitecture is based on that assessment. It includes guidance on how
best to operate the nuclear detection assets and authorities, as well
as a clear list of gaps in America’s nuclear detection efforts. Those
gaps lead to DNDO’s list of investment priorities.

I  would  recommend  giving  special  attention  to  the  methodology
and makeup of the Global Nuclear Detection architecture to better
illustrate the connection between risk and the DNDO’s budget. Ul-
timately,  these  individual  investments  can  serve  a  greater  goal  of
resilience,  security,  and  efficiency.  The  DNDO  and  the  Executive
Branch as a whole should be measured by the ability of their R&D
investments to do just that.

Thank you very much. I look forward to your questions.

I  am  a  Senior  Fellow  with  IBM’s  Global  Leadership  Initiative1 and  a  Managing
Consultant  for  IBM’s  Global  Business  Services.  I  am  here  to  address  three  items.
First,  I  will  discuss  select  high-leverage  and  innovative  components  of  the  DNDO’s
budget  that  I  believe  strike  the  right  balance  between  immediate  deployment  and
the  vital  long-term  commitment  to  basic  research.  Second,  I  will  address  the  need
for  investing  in  a  reorganization  that  is  currently  underway  at  DNDO  that  reflects
its  crosscutting  mission.  And  third,  I  will  place  this  mission  in  the  broader  context
of a framework that connects the defense against smuggled nuclear materials to the
imperative  of  protecting  the  stream  of  cargo,  people,  conveyances,  information,  and
money flows in the global trade system.

IBM  has  invested  in  the  development  of  new  thought  leadership  in  this  field  be-
cause  we,  like  the  Members  of  this  committee,  value  innovation.  Innovation  is  the
key  to  our  competitiveness—both  IBM’s  and  the  Nation’s.  IBM  spends  approxi-
mately $6 billion per year on research and development (R&D)—much of it on basic
research.  However,  increasingly,  IBM  and  others  also  are  investing  in  research  in
emerging  areas  such  as  services,  which,  as  you  may  be  aware,  make  up  approxi-
mately  80  percent  of  U.S.  economy,  while  employing  approximately  the  same  per-
centage of the U.S. labor force. As a country, we need to invest in the skills needed
for 21st century jobs that will almost certainly be dominated by the services market.
This  means  funding  investment  in  the  emerging  academic  discipline  of  services
science, including R&D and curriculum development.

My own work at IBM focuses on developing a comprehensive framework for secu-
rity, resilience, and efficiency in the global movement of goods, people, and informa-
tion.  From  2004  through  the  early  part  of  this  year,  I  was  Director  of  Homeland
Security Projects at the Center for the Study of the Presidency.2 Beginning in April
2004,  I  worked  with  Center  President  David  Abshire  to  organize  the  Nuclear  De-
fense Working Group. That group provided the groundwork and rationale for a gov-
ernment  reorganization  that  led  to  the  creation  of  the  Domestic  Nuclear  Detection
Office.
Origins and Initiatives of the DNDO

The single most devastating threat to America remains a nuclear weapon covertly
detonated  in  a  major  city.  Presidents  have  considered  this  risk  ever  since  Einstein
wrote  Franklin  Roosevelt  in  1939  to  warn  him  that  a  ‘‘bomb  of  this  type,  carried
by  a  boat  and  exploded  in  a  port,  might  very  well  destroy  the  whole  port  together
with  some  of  the  surrounding  territory.’’ 3 While  that  risk  is  much  greater  today
than it was then, some progress in the field of detection has been made.

In  April  2004,  a  talented  group  of  experts  gathered  at  the  Center  for  the  Study
of  the  Presidency  to  consider  an  intimidating  question:  Is  the  Nation  doing  all  that
it can to reduce the risk of covert nuclear attack at an acceptable cost? Norman Au-
gustine  co-chaired  the  session  with  then-Deputy  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security,
Admiral James Loy. Representatives from the Departments of Defense, Energy, and
Homeland Security, along with participants from the White House, national labora-
tories, and think tanks attended.

Two  perspectives  emerged  during  that  meeting.  One  held  that  highly  enriched
uranium (HEU) or plutonium used in a nuclear weapon is simply too difficult to de-
tect because of the low radiation levels they emit prior to detonation. The other ar-
gued that today’s technology simply lacks the strength to detect an element as sub-
tle as HEU, but improvements are not impossible. Both groups agreed that, among
other things, a better organization within government was necessary to improve de-
tection because existing national efforts simply were too disunified.4 Solving the po-
litical science problem would help solve the physical science problem.

The  result  was  the  creation  of  the  DNDO  in  April  2005  through  Homeland  Secu-
rity  Presidential  Directive  14.5 The  DNDO  was  born  out  of  the  acknowledgement
that  no  single  agency  had  the  assets,  authorities,  or  responsibilities  needed  to  ad-
dress  the  risk  of  covert  nuclear  attack.  Since  then,  this  office,  under  the  leadership
of Vayl Oxford, and the reorganization of DHS’s Science and Technology Directorate,

led  by  Under  Secretary  Cohen,  have  led  to  significant  progress  in  combating  the
threat of terrorism.

Over  the  past  two  years,  the  DNDO  has  stood  apart  as  a  work  in  progress  and
as  a  place  for  addressing  one  of  the  Nation’s  most  urgent  security  concerns.  While
the DNDO is still nascent, it is no longer ‘‘too early to tell’’ if it is achieving its goal
of  integrating  and  accelerating  national  efforts  to  combat  the  smuggled  nuclear
weapons threat.

Mr. Chairman, your invitation to testify before this committee included the impor-
tant  indicators  to  gauge  the  success  of  this  experiment:  Does  the  new  budget  re-
quest—the  third  for  this  office—advance  the  highest  priorities  for  combating  smug-
gled  nuclear  weapons?  Do  those  priorities  reflect  an  adequate  read  of  the  risk?  Are
current research efforts producing results that support the DHS mandate? Is DNDO
collaborating effectively with other federal agencies?

When  the  DNDO  first  was  created,  it  was  understood  by  its  authors  that  as  the
threat  of  nuclear  terrorism  and  proliferation  would  evolve,  America’s  relevant  tech-
nological  base  would  evolve,  as  would  other  significant  international  factors—such
as  the  wars  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan  and  Nunn-Lugar  programs.  It  was  therefore
critical that, as a hub for national efforts to combat the smuggling of nuclear mate-
rial,  the  DNDO  begin  with  a  net  assessment  of  the  Nation’s  capabilities  matched
against a current snapshot of the threat.

The DNDO’s ‘‘Global Nuclear Detection Architecture’’ is based on that assessment.
It includes guidance on how best to operate the nuclear detection assets, authorities,
and responsibilities. What emerges is a clear list of gaps in America’s covert nuclear
detection capabilities. Those gaps lead to the DNDO’s list of priorities.

The  Global  Nuclear  Detection  Architecture  is  an  interagency  product  designed  to
provide a plan for improving the status quo through a deliberate systems engineer-
ing  approach  to  a  gradual—and  perhaps  someday  rapid—reduction  of  the  risk  of
covert  nuclear  attack.  Its  success  depends  upon  a  multilayered  system  of  systems
that  must  knit  together  initiatives  contributing  to  a  reduction  of  the  risk  in  the
U.S., across the maritime and air domain, and in foreign territories.

DNDO  priorities  reflect  a  shared  perception  of  the  threat  as  it  evolves  over  time.
The  real  challenge  is  setting  a  budget  that  balances  the  imperative  of  deploying
available detection capabilities now with conducting basic and applied research that
push the limits of today’s technology and help create new capabilities for tomorrow.
Interwoven with that strategy is a more strategic asset: an integrated forensics mis-
sion that reaches across the U.S. Government.

To  adequately  combat  the  risk  of  smuggled  nuclear  material,  the  DNDO  invests
in  exploratory  research  that  challenges  assumptions  about  the  limits  of  technology.
It  takes  the  gaps  in  the  Global  Nuclear  Detection  Architecture  and  makes  longer-
term  R&D  commitments  to  promising  solutions.  These  efforts  can  lead  to  major
game-changing  improvements  in  our  ability  to  combat  nuclear  terrorism.  Some
promising examples include the following:

1) First,  the  FY08  budget  request  includes  about  $12  million  for  a  technology
demonstration  called  the  Verification  of  Shielded  Special  Nuclear  Material
(SNM).  This  initiative  addresses  the  risk  caused  by  a  proliferator  or  perpe-
trator who seeks to foil many currently deployed detectors by moving critical
bomb-making material while hiding it behind lead or other shielding.

2) Second,  the  budget  includes  about  $11  million  for  the  Intelligent  Personal
Radiation  Locator,  or  IPRL.  The  technology  represents  a  move  from  search
to surveillance, and it amounts to a transformation of the current version of
the  ‘‘pager’’  devices  now  used,  which  are  little  more  than  personal  Geiger
counters.  The  IPRL  investment  addresses,  albeit  in  a  limited  way,  the  gap
that was identified in the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture showing the
need  for  increased  numbers  of  smaller,  more  mobile  detectors  to  help  locate
stolen  nuclear  material  or  weapons  at  a  late  stage  of  deployment.  The  new
locators—presently  at  a  very  early  demonstration  stage—are  worn  on  a  belt
and  can  provide  the  wearer  with  indications  of  where  the  source  is  located
and  the  type  of  isotope  within  range.  They  also  have  the  ability  to  commu-
nicate wirelessly with other locaters so as to rapidly close in on a suspicious
source. All of this is done with increasing range and with greater reliability.
3) Third,  the  DNDO  is  developing  the  advanced  Stand-off  Detection  capability,
which  focuses  on  increasing  the  distance  from  dangerous  nuclear  material
while  decreasing  dwell  time  near  that  material.  Both  are  critical.  However,
the  challenge  of  nuclear  material  is  its  subtle  radiological  signature,  which
usually  requires  a  detector  to  be  both  close  to  the  suspected  source  and  in
its  vicinity  for  enough  time  to  gather  telltale  radiation.  By  soliciting  com-
peting  teams  of  partners  among  private  industry,  national  laboratories,  and

51

academia,  this  research  may  deliver  more  detailed  imaging  capabilities  at  a
range  that  is  increased  by  a  factor  of  10  or  more.  This  same  effort  could
produce  detectors  capable  of  working  effectively,  while  moving  at  a  rate  of
20  miles  per  hour.  The  result  of  faster  detection  at  a  greater  distance  from
the  source  material—combined  with  intelligence  tools  for  better  targeting—
will  not  only  protect  the  public  and  the  Nation’s  critical  assets,  but  it  also
will  facilitate  the  movement  of  cargo  through  ports  without  sacrificing  secu-
rity.

4) Fourth,  the  FY2008  budget  request  includes  $16.9  million  for  the  National
Technical Nuclear Forensics Center (NTNFC), which supports DNDO’s tech-
nical forensics responsibility. This money would support not only an R&D in-
vestment,  but  also  a  much-needed  reorganization.  Nuclear  forensics  cuts
across  the  entire  mission  space  from  deterrence  and  dissuasion,  to  detection
through  consequence  management,  to  attribution  and  response.  It  is  a  core
part of the mission of combating smuggled nuclear weapons.

The NTNFC should be considered a priority given the significant return on invest-
ment that progress in this area can deliver. While the Department of Homeland Se-
curity is not responsible for the entire spectrum of forensics, the NTNFC represents
a step forward in two clearly needed capabilities:

1. Across the government, unify various competencies and programs that are fo-

cused on aspects of the forensics mission.

2. Develop, enhance, and maintain technical forensics capabilities for pre-event

needs.

DNDO Collaboration

This  committee  asked  specifically  whether  the  DNDO  is  collaborating  effectively
with other federal agencies. I believe that combating the smuggled nuclear weapons
threat  is,  by  nature,  a  collaborative  mission.  This  mission  was  at  the  center  of  the
interagency  debates  in  2004,  and  the  DNDO  of  today  reflects  this  imperative.  This
is an area in which the DNDO has made progress.

Since  the  National  Technical  Nuclear  Forensics  Center  is  in  many  ways  a  micro-
cosm  of  the  DNDO,  I  would  like  to  highlight  a  few  examples  here  that  represent
a  broader  collaborative  effort  now  underway.  At  the  NTNFC,  the  FBI  provides  an
expert  as  Deputy  Assistant  Director,  and  it  also  provides  a  senior  liaison  from  the
FBI lab. The Department of Defense provides a detailee, and the Department of En-
ergy is assigning an expert of its own.

The  Forensics  Center  has  a  Working  Group,  made  up  of  members  from  each  rel-
evant federal agency and members of the intelligence community, which meets regu-
larly  to  address  high  priority  issues.  There  is  an  ‘‘Interagency  NTNF  Program  &
Budget  Crosscut’’  that  is  under  development  to  help  align  relevant  programs  and
harmonize  budget  requests.  Lastly,  the  NTNFC—and  the  DNDO  in  general—work
with  interagency  partners  in  planning  and  executing  exercises  that  support  the  re-
search,  development,  and  deployment  of  technologies,  as  well  as  shared  concepts  of
operations, or CONOPS.

DNDO  works  mostly  with  the  Department  of  Energy’s  (DOE’s)  Office  of  Non-
proliferation  Research  and  Development,  known  as  NA–22,  and  DOD’s  Defense
Threat  Reduction  Agency.  The  interactions  include  serving  as  proposal  evaluators
on each other’s programs, deconflicting projects by comparing portfolios, and jointly
participating in project reviews and technical reports.

The Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs), such as Standoff Detection and
Verification  of  Shielded  Nuclear  Material,  include  teams  that  have  developed  tech-
nology with funding from DNDO, DOE, DOD, and other sources. The purpose of an
ATD  is  to  develop  and  test  a  technology  that  addresses  a  critical  need  and  which
has reached a proof-of-concept stage, usually with payoff for more than one agency.
In  this  way,  DNDO  takes  advantage  of  work  that  is  funded  by  others,  but  it  also
supports R&D that can be useful to other agencies.

For example, some efforts at DNDO could contribute to Maritime Domain Aware-
ness  (MDA) 6,  a  major  program  developed  by  the  Coast  Guard  to  identify  threats
and  intercept  them  before  they  arrive  onshore.  In  MDA,  the  Coast  Guard  and  De-
partment of Defense require better intelligence, as well as detection and interdiction

6 MDA is the principle strategy articulated in ‘‘The National Plan to Achieve Maritime Domain
Awareness,’’  which  was  released  by  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  in  October  2005.  As
directed  by  National  Security  Presidential  Directive-41/Homeland  Security  Presidential  Direc-

capabilities to accomplish their goals. In the context of nuclear terrorism, a success-
ful mission depends upon the ability to detect threatening material or people at the
greatest possible distance. The ability of DNDO to contribute to that mission should
be a measure of its return on investment.
Placing Detection R&D Within a Broader Framework

Congress must view the effort to combat the smuggled nuclear weapons threat as
one  of  several  interlocking  objectives,  many  of  which  should  benefit  from  R&D  in-
vestments. Doing so requires a framework that connects the search for nuclear ma-
terials  to  the  broader  flows  of  cargo,  people,  conveyances,  information,  and  money
in  the  global  trade  and  travel  system.  And  that  framework  should  reach  across
DHS, DOD, DOE, State, and other departments to improve the resilience and secu-
rity of the global trade and travel system, while ensuring its security.

The  DNDO—and  DHS  S&T—should  figure  prominently  in  this  mission.  Ulti-
mately,  the  federal  R&D  management  process  must  more  effectively  link  the  stra-
tegic  planning  process  at  DHS  with  the  broader  mission  of  bringing  transparency,
efficiency, security, and resilience to one of the most attractive targets of WMD ter-
rorism: the global flow of trade and travel.

IBM  has  developed  a  framework  like  this  that  also  acknowledges  an  existing  in-
centive for the private sector, which is to satisfy the economic imperative to improve
the efficient and reliable flow of people, cargo, conveyances, money and information.
At IBM, we call this framework ‘‘Global Movement Management.’’ 7 It is a means
by  which  the  technology  requirements  of  today’s  homeland  security  measures  can
provide for both efficiency and security in the global movement of cargo, people, in-
formation,  and  finance.  This  new  framework  adds  resilience  to  this  critical  system
of movement without imposing inefficiencies that risk outweighing the security ben-
efits to the numerous stakeholders that use these systems of trade and travel.

For the DNDO, finding a smuggled nuclear weapon on a ship in the Port of Port-
land  is  too  late.  That  threat  must  be  identified,  verified,  and  interdicted  before  it
ever approaches. The DNDO investments that I highlighted go a long way in gener-
ating the transparency needed to identify a threat, but the broader strategy should
consider, in this example, that the shipping system itself must be able to withstand
a  disruption,  terrorist  or  otherwise.  This  is  because,  as  global  movement  becomes
ever more interdependent, a disruption—let alone an actual attack—would be cata-
strophic.
Conclusion

The  country  needs  a  strategic  framework  to  overarch  our  R&D  investments  for
maximum  benefit  to  both  our  homeland  security  interests  and  our  economic  com-
petitiveness.  DNDO  and  DHS  lack  this  strategic  framework  today.  Nevertheless,
DNDO  has  chosen  successfully  several  important  pilots,  including  those  I  men-
tioned.  Indeed,  Congress  should  view  DNDO’s  work  as  being  on  track  after  three
years.

But  Congress  also  should  consider  how  the  individual  investments  can  serve  a
greater  goal  of  resilience,  security,  and  efficiency.  The  DNDO,  and  the  Executive
Branch  as  a  whole,  should  be  measured  by  the  ability  of  their  R&D  investments  to
do just that.

Thank you. I would be happy to respond to any questions that you may have.

STATEMENT  OF  MS.  MARILYN  WARD,  EXECUTIVE  DIRECTOR,
NATIONAL  PUBLIC  SAFETY  TELECOMMUNICATIONS  COUN-
CIL (NPSTC)
Ms.  WARD.  Chairman  Wu,  Ranking  Member  Gingrey,  and  the
Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  on  behalf  of  the  National  Public
Safety  Telecommunications  Council,  referred  to  as  NPSTC,  it  is  a
privilege to appear before the Subcommittee and its examination of
the  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s  research  and  development
activities. We commend the Subcommittee’s work in this area.

NPSTC’s mission is devoted to improving the communications ca-
pabilities of local and State public safety agencies. NPSTC was cre-
ated in 1997, as a volunteer federation of 13 national public safety
associations. Our efforts are focused on the technological capability
and  the  capacity  of  radio  communications  and  the  coordination  of
these resources throughout all agencies.

The  following  are  just  a  few  examples  of  what  NPSTC  does.  We
provide the DHS SAFECOM Program local and State public safety
input to its Science and Technology research and development and
standard  efforts.  NPSTC  critically  examines  technical  and  regu-
latory  implications  regarding  radio  spectrum  utilization  and  man-
agement.

NPSTC  provides  comments  to  the  FCC  on  critical  public  safety
issues  representing  over  250,000  public  safety  responders.  NPSTC

provides  an  open  forum  for  discussion  and  dispute  resolution  on
public safety communications issues.

My  testimony  today  focuses  on  the  DHS  Science  and  Technology
role  in  furthering  public  safety  communications.  Through  its  Exec-
utive  Committee,  Emergency  Response  Committee,  and  organiza-
tions  like  NPSTC,  SAFECOM  is  developing  a  national  plan  to  en-
hance inter-operability.

We  believe  the  focus  on  new  and  innovative  technology  today  is
found  in  broadband.  The  challenge  is  that  public  safety  spectrum
is currently not available for a nationwide broadband network that
is  controlled  by  and  built  to  public  safety  standards  and  require-
ments.  The  recent  testimony  of  Chief  Harlan  McEwen  from  IACP,
the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and Chief Charles
Werner  of  the  International  Association  of  Fire  Chiefs,  to  the  Sen-
ate  Commerce  Committee  is  supported  by  all  of  the  major  public
safety  associations,  including  NPSTC,  and  it  is  attached  to  my
written testimony.

The public safety community is concerned that there was consid-
erable reduction in the 2007 budget and that the newly created Of-
fice  of  Emergency  Communications  was  left  unfunded.  Agencies
transferring  portions  of  their  budgets  to  fund  DHS  OEC  is  time-
consuming, it creates tension among agencies, and causes confusion
and uncertainty for the State and local community.

DHS  SAFECOM  has  pursued  development  of  regional  radio  sys-
tems  by  soliciting  participation  using  a  bottom-up  strategy.  Al-
though  this  takes  time,  it  is  a  critical  element  and  must  be  com-
pleted.  In  addition  to  the  tools  and  critical  studies  SAFECOM  de-
velops,  they  also  test,  evaluate  technologies,  conduct  pilot  pro-
grams,  and  are  funding  a  compliance  lab.  None  of  these  have  ade-
quate resources.

Although  not  directly  involved  with  the  Department’s  planning
and  priority  mechanisms,  we  do  not  see  projects  and  programs
based  on  long-term  solutions  to  the  problems  that  we  face  in  com-
munications. The budgets at the federal level fluctuate and are not
sustained in a manner that is conducive to long-term solutions.

DHS SAFECOM, along with their partners at the National Insti-
tute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  Office  of  Law  Enforcement
Standards,  and  the  National  Telecommunications  and  Information
Agency  Institute  for  Telecommunication  Sciences  are  currently
testing the current public safety standard commonly referred to as
P25.  This  is  an  especially  important  requirement  because  many  of
the State and local agencies, as well as the Department of Defense
and  other  federal  agencies,  are  using  P25  equipment.  Through  the
SAFECOM  Program,  NPSTC  has  been  involved  with  the  NIST/
OLES for many years such as in the development and review of the
SAFECOM Statement of Requirement for public safety communica-
tions technology.

Another  example  of  our  collaboration  occurred  last  month  when
NPSTC  worked  with  NTIA  ITS  in  Bolder  to  develop  requirements
for broadband technologies. Through this collaboration the original
input  of  57  practitioners  was  expanded  to  627  who  provided  input
to the project.

I  would  also  like  to  ask  that  this  subcommittee  review  our  com-
ments on the progress made regarding the recommendations of the

September 2004, GAO report on inter-operability, which is provided
in my written testimony.

In  closing,  there  are  two  issues  the  Subcommittee  and  Congress
should  consider.  First,  fluctuations  in  funding  for  communications
inter-operability  deters  progress.  Three  to  five-year  funding  esti-
mates  would  provide  stability  for  long-term  programs  and  strate-
gies and would result in considerably more improvements.

The  second  issue  we  would  like  you  to  consider  is  the  proposal
to  permit  the  creation  of  a  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  in  the
700 MHz and reallocating 30 MHz of spectrum to public safety that
is  scheduled  to  be  auctioned.  We  urge  Members  to  examine  this
issue  very  closely.  It  would  make  a  positive  and  important  con-
tribution to public safety communications.

Thank  you,  again,  for  the  invitation  to  appear  before  this  com-

mittee.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Ward follows:]

Chairman Wu, Ranking Member Gingrey, and Members of the Subcommittee:

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MARILYN WARD

On  behalf  of  the  National  Public  Safety  Telecommunications  Council  (NPSTC),  it
is  a  privilege  to  appear  before  the  Subcommittee  in  its  examination  of  the  Depart-
ment  of  Homeland  Security’s  Research  and  Development  Activities.  NPSTC’s  mis-
sion is devoted to improving the communications capabilities of local and State pub-
lic  safety  agencies.  With  heightened  domestic  defense  and  emergency  response  de-
mands, the work of the Department of Homeland Security in this area is vital.

NPSTC was created in 1997 as a volunteer federation of associations representing
State  and  local  public  safety  telecommunications  to  advance  communications  capa-
bilities,  including  inter-operability,  of  first  responders,  through  one  collective  voice
for  public  safety  communications.  NPSTC  serves  both  as  a  resource  and  advocate
for  public  safety  organizations  in  the  United  States  on  matters  relating  to  public
safety  telecommunications.  The  technical  capability  and  capacity  of  radio  commu-
nications  and  the  coordination  of  these  resources  across  all  agencies  are  funda-
mental to our core mission, that of speeding response to the citizen facing an emer-
gency.

NPSTC  is  dedicated  to  encouraging  and  facilitating,  through  its  collective  voice,
the  implementation  of  the  Public  Safety  Wireless  Advisory  Committee  (PSWAC),
and  the  700  MHz  Public  Safety  National  Coordination  Committee  (NCC)  rec-
ommendations. NPSTC explores technologies and public policy involving public safe-
ty  agencies,  analyzes  the  ramifications  of  particular  issues,  and  submits  comments
to  governmental  bodies  with  the  objective  of  furthering  public  safety  communica-
tions  worldwide.  NPSTC  serves  as  a  standing  forum  for  the  exchange  of  ideas  and
information  for  effective  public  safety  telecommunications.  The  following  14  organi-
zations participate in NPSTC:

American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials
American Radio Relay League
American Red Cross
Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies
Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International
Forestry Conservation Communications Association
International Association of Chiefs of Police
International Association of Emergency Managers
International Association of Fire Chiefs
International Municipal Signal Association
National Association of State Chief Information Officers
National Association of State Emergency Medical Services Officials
National Association of State Foresters
National Association of State Telecommunications Directors

Several  federal  agencies  are  liaison  members  to  NPSTC.  These  include  the  De-
partment  of  Agriculture,  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (SAFECOM  Program,
and  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency),  Department  of  Commerce  (Na-
tional  Telecommunications  and  Information  Administration),  Department  of  the  In-
terior,  the  Department  of  Justice  (National  Institute  of  Justice,  CommTech  Pro-
gram), and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

Below  is  an  illustration  of  the  NPSTC  organization,  its  four  operational  commit-
tees  and  multiple  working  groups.  It  is  clear  that  there  are  many  topics  to  be  re-
solved that impact public safety communications and NPSTC is active in developing
positions and advocating for State and local first responders.

NPSTC  IS  AN  ADVOCATE  FOR  PUBLIC  SAFETY  COMMUNICATIONS  IN

THE FOLLOWING WAYS:

NPSTC  is  the  only  national  consensus  forum  for  major  public  safety  associations
that  facilitates  an  open  dialog  and  exchange  of  information  on  critical  public  safety
telecommunication issues.

NPSTC  provides  the  SAFECOM  Program  local  and  State  public  safety  commu-
nications input to science and technology research and development projects and re-
lated standards efforts.

NPSTC  critically  examines  technical  and  regulatory  implications  regarding  radio

spectrum utilization and management.

NPSTC provides comments to the FCC on critical public safety issues upon receiv-
ing  consensus  from  its  14  member  associations,  representing  over  250,000  public
safety responders.

NPSTC’s  members  include  the  four  FCC  certified  public  safety  frequency  coordi-

nators.

NPSTC  includes  liaisons  from  the  Federal  Government  that  ensure  feedback  to

and from practitioners and policy-makers.

NPSTC  provides  an  open  forum  for  our  members,  guests  and  the  community  for
discussion and dispute resolution, including the ability for people who cannot travel
to attend the meetings by calling into a teleconference bridge.

NPSTC actively engages in securing and protecting spectrum for states and local-
ities: 700 MHz for Wide Area Voice and Data, 800 MHz Rebanding, continued VHF
& UHF availability and 4.9 GHz for on-site broadband.

NPSTC actively monitors key technology-related issues having long-term implica-
tions on public safety inter-operability by actively participating in Software Defined
Radio  forums  (SDR),  International  Association  of  Electrical  and  Electronics  Engi-
neers  (IEEE)  meetings,  and  international  public  safety  standards  efforts,  such  as
Project MESA.

NPSTC  addresses  public  safety  spectrum  issues  along  the  U.S.  border  by  partici-

pating in related State Department efforts.

NPSTC provides the SAFECOM Program a forum to monitor the pulse of the pub-

lic safety community and determine needs to improve inter-operability.

NPSTC  recently  developed  a  common  radio  channel  naming  plan  to  standardize
the  radio  channels  to  read  the  same  display  no  matter  where  the  responder  is  lo-
cated in the U.S.

NPSTC  is  currently  developing  a  dispute  resolution  procedure  for  700  MHz  Re-

gional Planning Committees when conflicts occur among adjacent regions.

NPSTC  monitors  4.9  GHz  and  5.9  GHz  testbeds  and  communicates  the  informa-

tion to the State and local public safety community.

NPSTC communicates the impact and solutions of nationwide reviews of in-build-

ing radio coverage to the public safety community.

NPSTC  promotes  a  national  forum  where  Amateur  Radio  and  public  safety  work

together on nationwide public safety wireless communication issues.

As  the  founding  Chair  and  current  Executive  Director  of  NPSTC,  I  would  like  to
convey  to  the  Subcommittee  how  important  its  work  is  and  relate  our  appreciation
for  inviting  us  to  speak  on  the  issues  that  impact  our  members  and  their  constitu-
ents in the first responder community. As you requested, the focus of my testimony
is  on  the  impact  of  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security,  Science  and  Technology
Directorate  (DHS  S&T  Directorate)  on  our  nation’s  public  safety  communications.
The issues that I have been asked to address are listed below. I want to emphasize
that in addressing these issues I will be largely focusing on the communications and
inter-operability issues, although I will also address the larger context of DHS sup-
port for the first responder community and localities.

and disasters.

• The  role  DHS  should  play  in  helping  localities  prepare  for  security  threats
• How  well  the  FY  08  budget  request  for  DHS  S&T  supports  the  development
• DHS  collaboration  with  State  and  local  governments  and  the  first  responder
community on standards development and how the first-responder community

made to assist the first responders with inter-operability.

Protecting the public is a key responsibility of all levels of government. From fed-
eral  agencies  down  to  local  fire  protection  districts  the  public  depends  on  us.  DHS
plays  a  key  role  in  this  effort  by  supporting  the  55,000  local  public  safety  agencies
in  their  daily  challenges  and  during  major  disasters  where  it  and  other  federal
agencies provide direct response and service. DHS funding is a critical element that
helps State and local public safety meet daily and catastrophic challenges. Commu-
nication is critical to meeting those challenges and DHS funding encourages all lev-
els  of  responders  to  work  together  to  promote  better  communications  systems,  in-
cluding solving inter-operability and other public safety communications issues.
The National Incident Management System (NIMS)

DHS  programs  such  as  the  National  Incident  Management  System  (NIMS)  start-
ed out as a guide for major events, but local agencies now find that the NIMS struc-
ture  is  also  effective  during  everyday  events  from  fires  to  hostage  situations.  DHS
supported the implementation of NIMS through the grant process and has been suc-
cessful at encouraging local public safety to embrace and use NIMS during joint re-
sponses  to  emergencies.  It  is  important  to  note  that  one  of  the  reasons  that  NIMS
works  is  because  it  was  developed  with  input  from  the  State  and  local  practitioner
community.  As  a  result,  DHS  was  able  to  both  draw  upon  best  practices  from  the
people that do this work daily as well as obtain ‘‘buy-in’’’ for the final product.

DHS  guidelines  are  now  requiring  local  agencies  to  develop  joint  plans  for  multi-
agency responses. Part of this challenge is that local agencies have long delayed sit-
ting  down  and  working  together.  With  DHS  funding  directed  at  regional  or  cross
jurisdictional  responses,  there  is  significant  incentive  to  finally  come  together  to
share resources and manage incidents effectively.

Inter-operability

58

The  heart  of  any  coordination  of  an  incident,  large  or  small  is  communications.
In this regard, the next round of federal grant dollars requires that states must de-
velop  statewide  communications  plans  that  also  include  counties,  cities,  and  local
districts. The guidelines for these statewide plans were developed by the SAFECOM
Program  located  within  the  DHS  Office  of  Inter-operability  and  Compatibility’
(OIC),  with  the  participation  of  local  responders  and  public  safety  communications
officials.

The  significance  of  the  national  guidelines  is  they  require  prior  planning  and,  at
the same time, ensure that grant funds are spent on specific solutions in accordance
with  those  plans.  When  the  major  issues  are  addressed  at  the  local  level,  it  also
means they are addressed at the national level. The challenge is to ensure that the
overall objectives meld into the State and local operational environment to enhance
effective response.

Interagency communication problems have been identified in every major incident
over  the  last  10  or  more  years.  Solving  this  issue  is  not  as  easy  as  it  might  seem.
State and local jurisdictions have invested billions of dollars in non-compatible com-
munication systems that are operating in different bands of spectrum. The solution
most  often  involves  building  new  infrastructure  which  is  very  expensive.  While  the
development  of  regional  systems  make  sense,  building  them  is  also  very  expensive
and  requires  a  heightened  level  of  cooperation  among  agencies.  It  also  involves
knowledge of best practices that is not always available at the local level. What has
emerged is not only an emphasis on infrastructure and equipment, but the planning
and  cooperation  needed  to  make  use  of  these  resources  effectively  across  all  agen-
cies.

The  DHS  Office  of  Inter-operability  and  Compatibility’s  SAFECOM  Program  has
been  one  of  the  true  successes  in  providing  assistance  to  State  and  local  agencies
to  meet  these  challenges.  SAFECOM  provides  research,  development,  testing  and
evaluation,  guidance,  tools,  and  templates  on  communications-related  issues  that
improve  emergency  response  through  more  effective  and  efficient  inter-operable
wireless communications.

The  key  to  the  success  of  SAFECOM  is  that  it  is  a  practitioner-driven  program
and has developed a process to facilitate the input of local and State emergency re-
sponse  practitioners.  SAFECOM,  working  with  its  Executive  Committee,  the  Emer-
gency  Response  Council,  and  organizations  in  the  practitioner  community,  like
NPSTC,  developed  a  national  plan  to  enhance  inter-operability,  a  Statement  of  Re-
quirements for communications equipment, systems, and tools to assist jurisdictions
to  develop  governance  structures  and  planning;  and,  consequently,  helped  facilitate
the  quicker  adoption  of  standards  and  grant  guidance  for  communications-related
grant programs, among other things.

Most recently SAFECOM completed a national Baseline Study of Inter-operability
to learn what the problems were at the local level. DHS also developed a Scorecard
of  Inter-operability  in  designated  Urban  Areas  (UAs)  using  public  safety  practi-
tioners  in  the  process.  A  key  next  step  will  be  to  develop  a  scorecard  on  standards
compliance  testing  at  the  local  level,  something  sorely  needed  to  assist  State  and
local jurisdictions in making the right procurements.

The  ‘‘scorecard’’  reviews  of  the  UAs  focused  on  three  main  areas:  Governance
(leadership and strategic planning); Standard Operating Procedures (plans and pro-
cedures); and Usage (use of equipment). The evaluation criteria was derived directly
from the SAFECOM Inter-operability Continuum and Inter-operability Maturity As-
sessment  Model  that  depicts  the  key  components  of  inter-operability—governance,
standard operating procedures, usage, technology, and training and exercises.

The findings identify gaps and areas for improvement. Key findings included:

metropolitan areas, but implementation is now needed.

• Plans for inter-operable communications are now in place in all 75 urban and
• Regular testing and exercises are needed to effectively link disparate systems
and  facilitate  communications  between  multi-jurisdictional  responders,  in-
cluding State and federal agencies.
• Cooperation among first responders in the field is strong, but formalized gov-
ernance (leadership and strategic planning) across regions is not as advanced.
In my opinion, these are important findings and should apply to all areas of pub-

lic safety nationwide, not just the Urban Areas.

There  also  needs  to  be  an  examination  to  determine  the  level  of  inter-operability
in  the  non-urban  areas  of  our  nation.  This  will  provide  a  better  idea  of  where  we
stand and the basis for determining future costs. Since 2003, DHS has awarded $2.9
billion in funding to enhance State and local inter-operable communications efforts;

this is a small amount, given that experts estimate an $18 billion infrastructure na-
tionwide that is not inter-operable and the equipment is outdated. We will continue
to see an inter-operability improvements only if there is adequate funding and grant
guidance to promote regional and statewide planning and systems.
Compliance Testing

Compliance testing of radio equipment is one item best done at the national level.
Local agencies do not have the facilities, experience, or the type of equipment to do
in-depth compliance testing. For example, at the present time there is only one na-
tional  standard  for  radio  equipment,  commonly  referred  to  as  P25  and  relating  to
inter-operability.  While  several  manufacturers  make  claims  that  their  products  are
P25 compliant; testing is necessary to validate their claims.

There  is  a  need  for  a  federal  agency  to  perform  these  compliance  tests  and  DHS
SAFECOM,  along  with  their  partners  at  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and
Technology  (NIST)  and  the  National  Telecommunications  and  Information  Agency
(NTIA)  Institute  for  Telecommunication  Sciences  (ITS)  fill  this  role.  This  is  espe-
cially true in that the Department of Defense (DOD), other federal departments and
State  and  local  agencies  are  now  all  using  P25  radio  equipment.  There  is  no  real
magic in which agency does the testing; it just needs to be done.

The  NIST  Office  of  Law  Enforcement  Standards  (OLES)  technical  staff  has  been
involved with NPSTC for many years, and they have included our volunteers in the
development  and  review  of  the  SAFECOM  Statement  of  Requirements  (SOR)  for
public safety technology. They have worked closely with NPSTC as it develops con-
sensus positions on the best technology use for first responders and provides a wel-
come check and balance to their work.
Broadband

An  example  of  our  collaboration  occurred  last  month  when  NIST/OLES  in  Boul-
der, Colorado worked with NPSTC to develop user’s needs in broadband. The effort
expanded the input of 57 practitioners who had provided input into the needs study.
With NPSTC support, 627 practitioners agreed to provide input to the project. Such
collaboration  is  mutually  beneficial  to  both  the  local  and  federal  communities.  The
SAFECOM Program provides an important mechanism for this collaboration.

The focus on new and innovative technology today is in broadband for public safe-
ty.  Ten  years  ago  the  public  safety  community  could  not  have  imagined  that
broadband  technology  would  have  advanced  as  it  has  today  and  have  the  potential
to  provide  so  much.  The  concern  today  is  that  broadband  was  not  planned  for  na-
tionwide use, and yet to ensure inter-operability that is what we need, a nationwide
broadband  network  that  is  controlled  by  and  built  to  public  safety  standards.  The
testimony to the Senate on February 8, 2007, of Chief Harlin McEwen representing
the  International  Association  of  Chiefs  of  Police  (IACP),  the  Association  of  Public
Safety  Communications  Officials-International  (APCO),  the  Major  Cities  Chiefs  As-
sociation  (MCC),  the  National  Sheriff’s  Association  (NSA),  and  the  Major  County
Sheriff’s Association and NPSTC along with the testimony of Chief Charles Warner
representing  the  International  Association  Of  Fire  Chiefs  (IAFC)  regarding
broadband  for  public  safety  is  attached  to  this  document.  This  testimony  is  sup-
ported by all of the major public safety associations and NPSTC.

The SAFECOM Inter-operability Baseline survey was sent to 22,400 randomly se-
lected  law  enforcement,  fire  response  and  emergency  medical  services  (EMS)  agen-
cies.  Findings  indicate  that  roughly  two-thirds  of  emergency  response  agencies
across  the  Nation  use  inter-operable  communications  in  varying  degrees.  Agencies
tend to be more developed in technology than they are in standard operating proce-
dures  and  exercises.  Cross-discipline  and  cross-jurisdiction  inter-operability  at  the
local level tends to be more advanced than between State and local agencies. In ad-
dition,  law  enforcement,  fire  response,  and  EMS  agencies  reported  similar  levels  of
development in most areas of inter-operability.

To  date,  no  national  survey  has  addressed  broadband  systems  owned  by  public
safety since there is currently little or no available (700 MHz or 4.9 GHz) spectrum
for  this  use.  The  700  MHz  block  of  spectrum  that  will  become  available  with  the
digital television transition will be the first opportunity for local public safety to use
these  new  technologies.  Many  local  agencies  have  developed  and  filed  their  plans
with  the  FCC  for  local  and  regional  use  of  the  broadband  spectrum.  The  transition
and release of this spectrum to public safety remains critical.

SAFECOM, in conjunction with NIST/OLES, recently brought together key stake-
holders  from  both  industry  and  the  public  safety  community  to  discuss  and  clarify
the varying perceptions of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP’s) role in public safety
communications.  This  technology  has  the  potential  for  significant  impact  on  public
safety communications. Yet there must be the ability to test its use for mission-crit-

ical activities and ensure its robust nature before marching into nationwide accept-
ance on local networks.
Funding Levels and Priorities

Of  great  concern  to  the  public  safety  community  is  that  despite  the  critical  work
being  done  by  OIC’s  SAFECOM  program,  it  has  never  been  adequately  funded.  In
Fiscal  Year  2007  OIC’s  entire  budget  was  $27.2  Million  to  fund  SAFECOM  and
other  programs  of  importance  to  the  first  responder  community.  The  Inter-operable
Communications  Technical  Assistance  Program  (ICTAP)  run  by  the  Grants  and
Training Office (G&T) only received $10 Million. The newly created Office of Emer-
gency Communications (OEC) has received no funding to date. Given the critical na-
ture  and  magnitude  of  the  challenge,  this  is  woefully  inadequate.  The  expectation
of  other  agencies  transferring  portions  of  their  budgets  to  fund  the  DHS  OEC  is
time  consuming  and  creates  concern  among  the  other  federal  agencies.  It  has  also
caused confusion and uncertainty amongst the State and local community.

DHS  needs  to  continue  to  more  broadly  encourage  the  development  of  regional
systems that are multi-jurisdictional, multi-disciplined, and inter-operable for all re-
sponders.  With  over  55,000  public  safety  entities  in  this  nation,  each  supporting
their  own  systems  and  political  jurisdiction,  as  I  noted  earlier,  the  estimate  to  up-
grade and/or replace communications equipment is over $18 billion dollars.

For example, I come from Orange County (Orlando) Florida. Our county radio sys-
tem cost $21 million in 1992 when it was built, and new sites continue to be added
to  accommodate  growth,  at  a  cost  ranging  from  a  quarter  of  a  million  to  a  million
dollars per radio site. This is one system in one of Florida’s 67 counties. Within Or-
ange County, there are several small cities and the City of Orlando which maintain
individual  systems.  I  was  with  the  City  of  Orlando  where  I  retired  after  27  years
with  the  Police  Department.  During  that  time  we  built  a  $10  million  dollar  system
while  the  county  was  building  their  $21  million  dollar  system.  We  pursued  joining
the  County  and  building  one  system  but  were  unable  to  cross  the  barriers  to  make
that  happen.  This  is  common  around  the  U.S.  Incentives  are  needed  to  eliminate
duplication and waste of taxpayer money.

NPSTC was formed for the sole purpose of bringing the multitude of public safety
disciplines  together  to  address  communication  issues.  In  this  area  we  have  found
that  DHS,  primarily  through  SAFECOM,  not  only  consults  with  our  community  on
issues, but solicits our participation in helping them develop planning and priorities.
It  embraces  the  objective  of  making  improvements  in  public  safety  communications
with  the  important  recognition  that  local  and  State  participation  is  crucial.  A  coop-
erative working relationship has been established over the years and our community
values  the  input  and  assistance  that  we  receive  not  only  from  DHS,  but  from  the
several federal agencies that interrelate with us on a regular basis.

The  success  of  homeland  security  depends  in  large  part  on  the  success  of  local
public safety. Local public safety relies on the support and guidance it receives from
its federal partners. The Department of Homeland Security should continue to facili-
tate a robust and substantive intersection between the Federal Government and the
response community.

In  addition  to  the  Office  of  Inter-operability  and  Compatibility,  we  are  currently
working with the NIMS Integration Center and other offices to update the National
Incident  Management  System  and  the  National  Response  Plan.  We  also  work  with
the Office of Grants and Training. The success of working together is critical to en-
sure  that  policies  and  procedures  are  operationally  driven  and  able  to  be  realisti-
cally implemented on the ground.

Areas  that  need  continued  enhancement  of  the  federal-public  safety  relationship
include critical infrastructure protection and information/intelligence sharing offices.
There  is  evidence  of  movement  in  information  and  intelligence  sharing,  but  the
emergency  services’  role  in  critical  infrastructure  protection  continues  to  be  chal-
lenging—due, in part, to emergency services unique role as both protector of sectors
and a sector to be protected.

A  final  note,  and  on  a  larger  scale,  intersections  between  local,  State  and  federal
entities  cannot  be  identified  nor  trusting  relationships  built  if  the  landscape  and
personnel  are  constantly  changing.  DHS’s  impending  re-organization  will  prove  an-
other test—but also an opportunity—to form relationships between the Federal Gov-
ernment and first responders.
The 2004 General Accountability Office Report

In  September  2004,  the  GAO  released  a  report  on  inter-operability  and  testified
before  the  Subcommittees  on  technology,  Information  Policy,  Intergovernmental  re-
lations,  and  Census,  House  of  Representatives  titled  Federal  Leadership  Needed  to
Facilitate Inter-operable Communications Among First Responders

61

Set  forth  below  is  what  the  GAO  determined  and  our  view  of  the  progress  three

years later:
GAO:  (1)  In  a  recent  report  on  inter-operable  communications,  we  recommended
that  the  Secretary  of  DHS  (1)  continue  to  develop  a  nationwide  database  and  com-
mon terminology for public safety inter-operability communications channels.

Progress  to  date:  With  the  support  of  the  SAFECOM  Program,  NPSTC  recently
completed a forum and methodology for responders to work toward common nomen-
clature.  NPSTC  has  made  progress  and  has  a  consensus  on  several  key  issues.  A
report has been distributed for review and comment, and we will be making a final
recommendation  to  our  Governing  Board  in  June  2007.  Federal  support  and  adop-
tion  by  the  FCC  is  now  needed  to  formalize  the  use  of  common  channel  naming
across the Nation.
GAO: (2) help states assess inter-operability in specific locations against defined re-
quirements.

Progress  to  date:  Through  DHS  Grants  and  Training  grant  awards,  75  Urban
Area Security Initiative (UASI) locations began developing plans and were accessed
by a standardized scorecard developed by SAFECOM and member associations. This
is important progress and must be extended statewide beginning in 2007.
GAO:  (3)  through  federal  grant  awards,  encourage  State  action  to  establish,  and
support a statewide body to develop and implement detailed improvement plans.

Progress  to  date:  The  SAFECOM  Program  created  grant  criteria,  which  were
placed  in  the  DHS  Grants;  however  it  has  taken  until  March  2007  for  the  first  na-
tional  meeting  hosted  by  the  National  Governors  Association  (NGA),  SAFECOM,
and  NPSTC  to  begin  statewide  planning.  This  process  will  request  states  to  volun-
tarily  provide  an  ‘‘inter-operability  coordinator’’  statewide  and  provide  guidance  for
states to begin developing statewide plans.
GAO: (4) require that grant applications be in compliance with statewide inter-oper-
ability plans, once they are developed.

Progress to date: Several states have made good progress to complete their plans,
however many are just beginning. The Grant guidance prepared by SAFECOM, sup-
ports this recommendation.
GAO:  GAO  also  recommended  that  the  Director  of  OMB  work  with  DHS  to  review
SAFECOM’s  functions  and  establish  a  long-term  program  with  appropriate  author-
ity  and  funding  to  coordinate  inter-operability  efforts  across  the  Federal  Govern-
ment.

Progress to date: In the opinion of the public safety community which I represent,
the SAFECOM Program has never been funded at an appropriate level. The fluctua-
tion  in  budgeted  funds  belies  any  attempt  for  long-term  programs  to  be  successful.
Short quick fixes become the norm and the possibility for a long-term strategic plan
that stays the course until it is completed is threatened when funding fluctuates in
these  extremes.  In  addition  to  the  tools  and  critical  studies  (Baseline  Study,  etc.),
SAFECOM  also  tests  and  evaluates  technologies,  conducts  pilot  programs,  and
funds  the  standards  compliance  testing.  None  of  these  efforts  have  adequate  re-
sources.

GAO:  The  current  wireless  inter-operable  communications  capabilities  of  first  re-
sponders  nationwide  have  not  been  determined.  To  assess  these  capabilities,  a  set
of  requirements  is  needed  that  can  be  used  to  assess  ‘‘what  is’’  compared  to  ‘‘what
should  be.’’  The  Office  of  Management  Budget  (OMB)  has  established  the  Wireless
Public  Safety  Inter-operable  Communications  Program,  SAFECOM,  within  the  De-
partment of Homeland Security (DHS) as the focal point for coordinating federal ef-
forts to improve inter-operable communication.

In April 2004, SAFECOM issued a document designed to serve as a set of baseline
requirements  and  is  working  to  develop  a  baseline  of  current  capabilities  by  July
2005.

Progress  to  date:  The  baseline  was  published  in  2006  and  UASI  scorecards  were

published in 2007.
GAO:  The  Federal  Government  can  take  a  leadership  role  and  provide  support  for
developing:
(1) a national database of inter-operable communication frequencies,

Progress  to  date:  This  remains  a  challenge,  the  closest  version  is  the  700  MHz
‘‘notebook  of  frequencies’’  developed  by  NPSTC  and  funded  and  maintained  by  the
National Institute of Justice (NIJ).
GAO: (2) a common nomenclature for those frequencies,

62

Progress  to  date:  NPSTC  continues  to  commit  significant  work  on  this  issue.
SAFECOM  has  included  a  grant  guidance  principle  to  encourage  common  channel
naming.
GAO:  (3)  a  national  architecture  that  identifies  communications  requirements  and
technical standards,

Progress  to  date:  This  is  an  in-progress  task  undertaken  by  the  SAFECOM  Pro-
gram.  This  is  a  very  technical  and  expensive  process  that  does  not  have  adequate
resources at this time.
GAO: (4) statewide inter-operable communications plans.

Progress to date: This process began in 2007.

GAO:  State  and  local  governments  can  play  a  large  role  in  developing  and  imple-
menting  plans  to  improve  public  safety  agencies’  inter-operable  communications.
State and local governments own most of the physical infrastructure of public safety
communications  systems,  and  states  play  a  central  role  in  managing  emergency
communications.  States,  with  broad  input  from  local  governments,  are  a  logical
choice  to  serve  as  a  foundation  for  inter-operability  planning  because  incidents  of
any  level  of  severity  originate  at  the  local  level  with  states  as  the  primary  source
of support.

However, states are not required to develop inter-operability plans,
Progress  to  date:  States  are  not  required  to  develop  inter-operability  plans;  how-

ever States must have a plan to qualify for federal communications grant funds.
GAO: there is no clear guidance on what should be included in such plans.

Progress  to  date:  SAFECOM  is  proving  planning  guidance  to  the  states  at  the
March  2007  meeting  and  funding  is  being  made  available  to  support  the  develop-
ment of statewide planning assistance.

It  is  NPSTC’s  view  that  the  DHS  SAFECOM  Program  has  worked  diligently  to
meet  the  goals  identified  in  the  GAO  report  and  has  provided  support  to  the  local
communities, recognizing that it must be a practitioner-driven program. SAFECOM
has  achieved  inter-operable  communications  at  the  command  level,  defined  as  com-
munications within one hour of a major event, in the 10 highest threat urban areas,
as part of its Rapid COM 1 initiative. It has published a step-by-step planning guide
for  developing  a  locally  driven  statewide  strategic  plan  for  inter-operable  commu-
nications and facilitated regional communications inter-operability pilots that assist
local officials in the implementation of their statewide plans.

In addition to the practitioner input SAFECOM seeks from NPSTC and the prac-
titioner  community,  SAFECOM  seeks  advice  from  the  first  responder  community
through its Executive Committee (EC) and the Emergency Response Council (ERC).
The SAFECOM EC is comprised of representatives from local and State emergency
response  agencies  and  professional  associations,  as  well  as  contributing  federal
agencies.  Working  through  the  associations  is  critically  important  to  ensure  State
and local collaboration with the Federal Government. The EC serves as the primary
steering group for the SAFECOM Program. Montgomery County, Maryland, Council
chairwoman  Marilyn  Praisner,  National  Association  of  Counties  (NACo),  serves  as
EC Chair, and Mr. Glen Nash, Past-President, Association of Public-Safety Commu-
nications Officials, International (APCO), serves as Vice Chair.

Summary

The  work  of  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  in  public  safety  communica-
tions  is  vital  if  we  are  to  meet  the  expanded  demands  of  domestic  security  and

emergency  response.  We  believe  that  DHS,  its  SAFECOM  program  and  other  com-
ponent  agencies  diligently  pursue  this  responsibility  and  recognize  the  critical  im-
portance of meaningful local participation.

In closing, I think there are two issues the Subcommittee should consider as part
of  the  overall  effort  to  improve  public  safety  communications.  First,  the  fluctuation
in  funding  of  the  budget  as  it  pertains  to  communications  inter-operability  deters
progress.  A  more  stable  environment  with  a  better  estimate  of  funding  levels  for  a
three-  to  five-year  period  would  allow  the  planning  and  funding  participation  to  be
pursued. The result would be more participation and system improvements.

The second issue is a proposal to permit the creation of a Public Safety Broadband
Trust  in  700  MHz  and  reallocating  30  MHz  of  spectrum  scheduled  to  be  auctioned.
This  broadband  trust  would  be  a  first  for  public  safety.  With  a  Congressional  em-
brace, a nationwide broadband inter-operable radio system could be built that would
permit  first  responders  to  have  everything  from  blackberry  type  messages  to  full
motion video of incidents. It would be paid for by private funds as the system would
sell  excess  capacity  to  non-public  safety  users.  It  is  also  a  way  to  bring  the  advan-
tages  of  broadband  to  rural  areas  that  now  have  none.  It  would  expand  access  to
new  technologies  without  burdening  taxpayers.  We  urge  members  to  examine  this
issue  very  closely;  it  would  make  a  positive  and  important  contribution  to  public
safety communications.

Thank  you  again  for  the  invitation  to  appear  before  the  Subcommittee.  I  would

be pleased to respond to any questions.

My  name  is  Harlin  McEwen  and  I  have  been  actively  involved  in  public  safety
for  almost  50  years.  My  career  has  been  in  law  enforcement  and  I  also  have  been
a volunteer firefighter. I am the retired Police Chief of the City of Ithaca, New York,
and am also retired as a Deputy Assistant Director of the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation in Washington, DC. I serve as Chairman of the Communications and Tech-
nology Committee of the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), a posi-
tion I have held for more than 28 years. I also serve as the Communications Advisor
for  the  Major  Cities  Chiefs  Association  (MCC),  the  National  Sheriffs’  Association
(NSA),  and  the  Major  County  Sheriffs’  Association.  I  am  the  Vice  Chairman  of  the
National  Public  Safety  Telecommunications  Council  (NPSTC)  and  am  a  Life  Mem-
ber  of  the  Association  of  Public-Safety  Communications  Officials-International
(APCO). Today I speak on behalf of all of these organizations.

When  I  first  became  a  law  enforcement  officer  in  1957  police  vehicles  had  tube
type six volt analog mobile radios that dimmed the headlights when we pushed the
microphone  button.  In  those  days  there  were  no  hand  held  radios.  In  my  career  I
have  witnessed  many  changes  and  advances  in  law  enforcement  and  public  safety
communications.  However,  the  advances  for  public  safety  have  consistently  lagged
behind  the  advances  of  commercial  services,  primarily  because  of  lack  of  funding
and spectrum.

As you are aware, citizens rely upon their local and State police agencies, sheriffs’
offices, fire departments, emergency medical services, and other emergency services
like  highway  and  public  works  and  utilities  to  come  to  their  assistance  wherever
and  whenever  needed.  They  respond  whether  it  is  a  crime  in  progress,  a  civil  dis-
turbance,  a  building  fire,  a  forest  fire,  an  automobile  accident,  a  health  emergency,
a  natural  disaster,  or,  as  we  learned  on  9/11,  a  terrorist  attack.  Today,  citizens  as-
sume that those first responders will get the call and will have the communications
tools  they  need  to  address  emergencies  quickly  and  efficiently.  Unfortunately  that
is not always true.

I want to applaud the efforts of this committee and the Congress in voting to clear
the  television  broadcasters  from  the  long  promised  700  MHz  spectrum.  This  will
help us improve public safety radio communications, both operability and inter-oper-
ability. The major cities and metropolitan areas of this country are still in desperate
need  of  additional  land  mobile  voice  channels  and  are  anxiously  waiting  for  this
spectrum  to  become  available.  Your  efforts  to  designate  $1  billion  derived  from  the
auction  of  radio  spectrum  for  public  safety  communications  are  also  very  much  ap-
preciated by the public safety community and will be very helpful. The introduction
of  S.385  by  Senators  Inouye,  Stevens,  Kerry,  Smith,  and  Snowe  is  also  helpful  in
giving direction to NTIA with respect to the $1 billion grant program and we appre-
ciate  these  efforts  to  have  this  funding  program  implemented  in  a  timely  fashion.
I  am  pleased  to  have  the  chance  to  discuss  with  this  committee  an  exciting  new
opportunity  for  Congress  to  take  steps  that  will  pave  the  way  to  reducing  the  de-
pendence  on  local  and  federal  tax  revenues  to  maintain  modern  public  safety  com-
munications  systems.  That  is  a  proposal  for  a  700  MHz  nationwide  public  safety

broadband  network.  This  proposed  network  can  become  a  reality  only  if  Congress
authorizes  creation  of  a  public/private  partnership,  controlled  by  the  public  safety
community,  to  hold  a  nationwide  license  for  30  MHz  of  spectrum  in  the  upper  700
MHz band and further authorize us to deploy this network pursuant to a public sec-
tor-private sector partnership model.

I  have  studied  the  issue  of  public  safety  telecommunications  for  decades.  I  have
been  actively  engaged  in  the  efforts  of  the  Federal  Communications  Commission,
other  federal  agencies,  State  and  local  government  entities  and  individual  depart-
ments  to  identify  law  enforcement  communications  requirements  and  provide  our
first responders with the necessary tools to meet those needs. Substantial time and
significant taxpayer dollars have been devoted to those efforts, yet in 2007 the pub-
lic  safety  community  still  is  far  behind  commercial  users  in  terms  of  wireless
functionality. Our public safety users who should have the best, most advanced, and
most robust capabilities too often must rely on systems that are inadequate for their
needs  today,  much  less  the  expanded  responsibilities  with  which  they  will  continue
to be charged in the future. Without a fundamental change in the way we approach
emergency  responder  communications,  specifically  without  allocation  of  the  addi-
tional  30  MHz  of  spectrum  and  adoption  of  the  approach  embodied  in  the  Public
Safety Broadband Trust (PSBT) proposal, I see no reason to ever expect substantial
improvement.

The wireless voice systems public safety personnel use today are among the most
important  tools  they  have  to  do  their  job  in  a  safe  and  efficient  manner.  However,
these  systems  have  in  many  cases  been  under  funded,  poorly  maintained  and  gen-
erally  not  refreshed.  As  we  look  to  the  long-term  future,  we  need  to  look  at  new
and better ways to improve public safety communications.

The  need  for  more  efficient  public  safety  data  systems  is  growing  and  this  has
become  the  focus  of  much  of  our  attention  as  we  look  to  ways  for  public  safety  to
take  advantage  of  Third  Generation  (3G)  and  Fourth  Generation  (4G)  technologies.
The implementation of a nationwide public safety broadband network can also be
the  beginning  of  the  end  to  the  problem  of  public  safety  inter-operability.  We  have
been  asking  for  funding  support  for  years  to  help  us  upgrade  and  replace  mission
critical  land  mobile  voice  systems  that  are  built  by  different  manufacturers,  are  of
different vintages, and are generally incompatible and in many cases not compatible
with the P25 standards, the only recognized national digital standards for land mo-
bile public safety communications inter-operability.

It is critical to understand that this is a one time only opportunity to solve many
of the public safety communications requirements of today and the future. We recog-
nize this is not an easy decision for the Congress. You must choose between solving
the  public  safety  communications  problem  and  making  sure  our  citizens  have  good
public  services,  or  allowing  the  spectrum  required  by  public  safety  to  be  auctioned
to commercial companies who want to expand their services and increase their prof-
its.  It  seems  simple  to  us  that  by  your  approval  of  this  important  step  for  public
safety you will be doing the right thing for America. It will begin to take the burden
off the taxpayers who must build and maintain increasingly expensive public safety
communications systems.

The  benefits  from  a  nationwide  public  safety  broadband  network  as  set  forth  in

the Public Safety Broadband Trust proposal are as follows:

1. Broadband  data  services  (such  as  text  messaging,  photos,  diagrams,  and
streaming video) not currently available in existing public safety land mobile
systems.

2. A hardened public safety network with infrastructure built to withstand local
natural  hazards  (tornadoes,  hurricanes,  earthquakes,  floods,  etc)  that  would
include  strengthened  towers  and  back  up  power  with  fuel  supplies  to  with-
stand long-term outages of public power sources.

3. Nationwide  roaming  and  inter-operability  for  local,  State,  and  federal  public
safety  agencies  (police,  fire  and  EMS)  and  other  emergency  services  such  as
transportation, health care, and utilities.

4. Access to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) similar to current

commercial cellular services.

5. Push to talk, one to one and one to many radio capability that would provide
a  backup  to  (but  not  replace)  traditional  public  safety  land  mobile  mission
critical voice systems.

6. Access  to  satellite  services  to  provide  reliable  nationwide  communications
where  terrestrial  services  either  do  not  exist  or  are  temporarily  out  of  serv-
ice.

For  those  who  argue  that  public  safety  already  has  enough  radio  spectrum  to
meet current and projected mobile requirements, I can only say that they purposely
ignore  the  facts  concerning  public  safety  spectrum  allocations  and  first  responder
communications requirements. As an example, the cellular industry, represented by
CTIA,  has  grossly  misrepresented  the  spectrum  issue  as  recently  exhibited  in  their
press  release  critical  of  Senator  McCain’s  announcement  that  he  would  be  intro-
ducing  legislation  to  establish  a  new  nationwide,  state-of-the-art  public  safety
broadband  network.  The  CTIA  statement  said  ‘‘the  basic  facts  of  the  matter  should
compel  this  important  debate  to  be  about  providing  first  responders  with  funding,
access  to  equipment  and  coordination,  not  more  spectrum.’’  CTIA  further  stated
‘‘Right  now,  the  public  service  community  utilizes  47  MHz  of  spectrum  to  serve  its
public  safety  users.  At  the  same  time,  there  are  wireless  carriers  that  use  roughly
the same amount of spectrum to deliver voice, data and advanced information serv-
ices to many times that number of subscribers. More spectrum is clearly not the an-
swer.’’

Contrary  to  what  the  CTIA  says,  the  REAL  facts  on  spectrum  allocations  are  as

follows:

But  even  these  numbers  do  not  tell  the  real  story  or  explain  why  existing  public
safety  allocations  cannot  be  used  for  broadband  operations.  Historically,  the  FCC
has  allocated  individual  channels,  not  contiguous  channel  blocks,  for  public  safety
use. These channels are immediately adjacent to channels allocated for taxicab com-
panies,  truck  operators  and  other  businesses.  The  channels  typically  are  no  larger
than  25  kHz  bandwidth  and  more  frequently  12.5  kHz,  or  a  tiny  fraction  of  each
25  MHz  cellular  system  authorization.  This  allocation  approach  has  permitted  nu-
merous  governmental  entities  to  secure  licenses  for  localized,  individual  purposes,
but  precludes  the  public  safety  community  as  a  whole  from  consolidating  enough
contiguous  channels  to  deploy  21st  century  broadband  technology  networks.  There
simply  is  not  sufficient  contiguous  bandwidth  to  support  the  text  messaging,  build-
ing diagrams, photos, streaming video and other transmissions that will be as essen-
tial  to  law  enforcement  officers  during  these  perilous  times  as  the  weapons  they
carry.

While  the  24  MHz  public  safety  allocation  in  the  upper  700  MHz  band  is  contig-
uous,  even  that  spectrum  is  subdivided  in  various  categories  designed  for  mission
critical voice communications on both localized and State levels, as well as for wide-
band  data  applications.  And  that  spectrum  allocation,  first  promised  to  the  public
safety community in 1997, was intended to address the unmet needs and identified
deficiencies in the spectrum resources available to public safety more than a decade
ago. New technologies and new services have since been developed to respond to the
ever  escalating  commercial  appetite  for  more  useful  and  sophisticated  mobile  com-
munications  tools  and  solutions—and  appropriate  new  commercial  spectrum  alloca-
tions have been made available to commercial network operators to bring those im-
provements to their customers. Likewise, over the past decade, public safety’s needs
for access to these advanced technologies, services, tools and solutions has not stood
still—although,  unfortunately,  the  amount  of  appropriate  spectrum  allocated  to
meet them has.

Allow me to emphasize these points by example, as the contrast between the spec-
trum resources available to commercial wireless network operators and to the public
safety  community  could  not  be  more  striking.  To  begin  with,  commercial  cellular
and PCS licensees have access to large blocks of contiguous spectrum. Their alloca-
tions  were  specifically  designed  to  support  system  architectures  and  technologies
that would accommodate vast numbers of customers. To compare the number of sub-
scribers that can be served on a 25 MHz cellular network with the number of police

officers  that  can  share  a  12.5  kHz  bandwidth  channel,  or  even  multiple  channels,
is as meaningful as comparing the size of watermelons to grapes. Compounding the
imbalance  is  the  absolute  amount  of  spectrum  that  has  been  made  available  for
commercial  use  in  comparison  to  that  which  has  been  made  available  for  public
safety uses as detailed above. Just last year, the Commission made another 90 MHz
of  spectrum  of  Advanced  Wireless  Spectrum  available  for  commercial  operations,
again  in  large  spectrum  blocks  and  expressly  authorized  for  commercial  mobile
broadband uses.

In fact, it is the success of the cellular/PCS model that has convinced us that pub-
lic safety must have a 30 MHz spectrum block on which to deploy an advanced tech-
nology broadband network. That model has persuaded us that the public safety com-
munity must join together in the Public Safety Broadband Trust, rather than seek-
ing  individual  licenses  for  individually  designed  and  deployed  systems,  if  we  are  to
achieve  our  objective:  seamless  nationwide  roaming  capability  on  a  21st  century
broadband  700  MHz  network  that  is  built  and  operated  to  satisfy  increasing  and
demanding public safety requirements.

I  stated  previously  that  a  nationwide  broadband  network  solution  needed  to  ad-
dress  both  spectrum  and  funding,  and  to  address  them  both  at  the  same  time  and
in the same context. The latter is just as critical as the former and requires an inno-
vative  approach  given  the  extraordinary  costs  associated  with  building  and  oper-
ating  a  truly  nationwide  broadband  network.  Unlike  purely  commercial  systems
that  have  the  luxury  of  limiting  coverage  to  areas  of  denser  population  and  trans-
portation  corridors,  public  safety  users  must  have  communications  capability  wher-
ever  there  are  people  or  property  to  protect.  This  mandate  has  the  important  con-
sumer benefit of ensuring that a broadband network designed to meet public safety
needs will be available in suburban and rural communities that remain outside the
areas of commercial broadband deployment. However, I have substantial experience
in the traditional funding sources for public safety communications and see no real-
istic  possibility  that  the  necessary  monies  will  be  made  available  even  to  build,
much  less  maintain,  operate  and  routinely  upgrade  a  network  of  this  scope  if  dedi-
cated to purely public safety requirements.

The only solution that we consider viable is a public sector-private sector partner-
ship  as  proposed  in  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust.  Under  this  approach,  the
PSBT  would  acquire  a  30  MHz  license  at  700  MHz  and  would  enter  into  leases  of
spectrum  usage  rights  with  commercial  operators  who  would  build  a  nationwide
public  safety  network  that  (1)  would  be  paid  for  by  commercial  operators  using  ex-
cess  capacity,  not  by  the  public  safety  community  or  the  taxpayer;  (2)  would  be  li-
censed  and  controlled  by  public  safety  representatives  to  ensure  public  safety  pri-
ority  access;  and  (3)  would  be  refreshed  with  the  latest  technical  improvements,
funded by the commercial participants.

We  do  not  support  what  some  would  call  a  ‘‘hosted’’  public  safety  network.  While
the  term  may  have  somewhat  different  meanings  to  different  people,  at  its  core  it
puts  mission  critical,  emergency  response  communications  in  a  position  of  depend-
ence with respect to the host commercial provider. Moreover, it undermines or even
negates  the  essential  nationwide  character  of  the  network.  With  all  due  respect  to
commercial  operators  that  might  now  express  support  for  hosted  systems,  there  is
nothing in the over 20-year history of commercial wireless systems that would vali-
date  their  reliability  or  availability  for  mission  critical  public  safety  needs.  That  is
not an arrangement that the public safety community could endorse.

In  regard  to  the  9th  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  (NPRM)  recently  issued  by
the  Federal  Communications  Commission,  we  have  many  concerns  about  the  con-
cepts  set  forth  in  that  proposal.  The  9th  NPRM  suggests  that  a  nationwide
broadband network could be built using the 12 MHz of spectrum currently allocated
for  local  licensing  of  public  safety  wideband  systems.  This  would  take  away  from
local licensing control the spectrum long promised for use by local agencies. In addi-
tion  we  believe  the  proposal  is  seriously  flawed  by  failing  to  acknowledge  the  need
for  enough  spectrum  to  attract  investors  to  participate  in  a  public/private  partner-
ship where private funds would be invested to build a nationwide network.

By  contrast,  the  partnership  outlined  in  the  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  cre-
ates  a  symbiotic  and  balanced  relationship,  but  one  in  which  public  safety  always
remains in control. It represents a win-win opportunity if sufficient spectrum is allo-
cated to accommodate both public safety and commercial usage. Public safety cannot
fund  this  network  on  its  own,  but  also  must  be  confident  that  the  network  is  built
to  hardened  public  safety  requirements  with  priority  access  that  is  adequate  to  re-
spond  to  emergencies.  Commercial  operators  will  lease  the  spectrum  and  build  the
network to public safety specifications, but only if there is sufficient excess capacity
to permit meaningful commercial service on a regular basis. The technical data sup-

69

ports  the  conclusion  that  a  minimum  of  30  MHz  is  needed  to  serve  these  com-
plementary requirements.

The many public safety organizations and agencies that have supported the PSBT
approach  recognize  that  it  will  require  removing  some  of  the  700  MHz  spectrum
that  currently  is  scheduled  to  be  auctioned.  The  PSBT  proposal  includes  a  plan  to
make  the  federal  budget  whole.  The  PSBT  would  raise  $5  billion  to  pay  the  U.S.
Treasury  for  the  spectrum,  using  the  revenues  from  the  commercial  users  and  the
assistance of federal loan guarantees similar to those that have been made available
to industries such as airlines, pipelines and automobile manufacturers. This financ-
ing  arrangement  would  ensure  that  other  federal  public  safety  spending  priorities,
including the $1 billion for other public safety inter-operable communications needs,
would not be affected.

Let  me  add  that  I  and  other  supporters  of  the  PSBT  also  endorse  the  commend-
able  work  being  done  by  local  and  regional  organizations  such  as  the  Capitol  Area
Region  Broadband  Project  with  respect  to  broadband.  To  the  extent  their  efforts
bring  about  public  safety  communications  improvements,  it  is  important  work  that
deserves  support.  But  we  must  remain  mindful  that  the  results  will  be,  at  best,  a
patchwork of improved, but incompatible, non-inter-operable networks at a daunting
per unit cost. They are doing what they can in light of the regulatory and financial
environment  in  which  they  must  operate,  but  this  nation  can  and  must  do  better.
I have dedicated most of my professional career to the advancement of public safe-
ty  communications.  From  that  perspective,  I  believe  this  Congress  has  an  extraor-
dinary  time  sensitive  opportunity.  Approval  of  the  PSBT  and  the  public  sector-pri-
vate  sector  partnership  will  catapult  public  safety  to  its  rightful  place  in  the  fore-
front  of  communications  capability  while  at  the  same  time  delivering  broadband
service  to  communities  that  continue  to  be  bypassed  by  the  commercial  tele-
communications  revolution.  I  hope  you  will  share  my  belief  that  this  is  an  oppor-
tunity that must be seized for the benefit of the entire American public.

Public Safety Broadband Trust

STATEMENT BY FIRE CHIEF CHARLES L. WERNER

INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIRE CHIEFS

BEFORE THE

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE & TRANSPORTATION

UNITED STATES SENATE

FEBRUARY 8, 2007

Good morning Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. I am Charles Wer-
ner, Fire Chief of the Charlottesville Fire Department in Virginia and a member of
the  Communications  Committee  of  the  International  Association  of  Fire  Chiefs
IAFC).  I  am  appearing  today  as  the  representative  of  the  International  Association
of Fire Chiefs whose 12,000 members represent the leadership of America’s fire and
rescue  service  from  small,  rural,  volunteer  fire  departments  to  the  large,  urban,
metropolitan fire departments. Last year America’s fire service responded to over 23
million fire and emergency calls covering incidents of structure fires, wildland/urban
interface  fires,  emergency  medical  situations,  hazardous  materials  incidents,  tech-
nical  rescues,  and  natural  disasters.  We  are  prepared,  as  well,  to  respond  to  the
aftermath of terrorist attacks. I appear today to address a specific and growing com-
munications  need  for  America’s  fire  service—broadband  technology.  Our  testimony
also reflects the views of the Association of Public-Safety Officials International, Inc.
PUBLIC SAFETY SPECTRUM NEEDS

At the request of Congress, the National Telecommunications and Information Ad-
ministration  (NTIA)  and  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC)  estab-
lished the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee (PSWAC) to define and docu-
ment  the  critical  need  for  communications  resources  and  the  spectrum  to  support
public  safety  through  the  year  2010.  The  final  report  was  released  on  September
11, 1996. Three key problem areas were identified in the report:

First,  radio  frequencies  allocated  to  public  safety  had  become  highly  congested
in many, especially urban, areas. Usable spectrum for mobile operations is lim-
ited  making  it  difficult  to  meet  existing  requirements  much  less  to  plan  for  fu-
ture, more advanced communications needs.
Second, the ability of agencies within and between jurisdictions to communicate
with one another is limited. Yet inter-operability is desirable for success in day-
to-day  operations  as  well  as  larger  scale  operations  in  dealing  with  both  man-
made and natural disasters.
Third, public safety agencies lack the spectrum to implement advanced commu-
nications  features.  A  wide  variety  of  technologies—both  existing  and  under  de-
velopment—hold  substantial  promise  to  reduce  danger  to  public  safety  and
achieve greater efficiencies in the performance of their duties. Specifically men-
tioned in the 1996 report were broadband data systems, video systems for better
capabilities  including  use  of  robotics  in  toxic  and  hazardous  environments,  and
better monitoring and tracking of both personnel and equipment.

To  implement  the  requirements  identified,  the  advisory  committee  determined

that more spectrum was required, as follows:

Immediately, 2.5 MHz of spectrum for inter-operability from new or existing al-
locations.
Within  five  years  approximately  25  MHz  of  new  public  safety  allocations  are
needed.  The  report  suggested  using  spectrum  from  television  broadcast  chan-
nels 60–69 as soon as possible.
Over  the  next  15  years  (e.g.,  through  2011)  as  much  as  an  additional  70  MHz
will be required to satisfy the mobile communications needs of public safety.

These  were  the  needs  and  recommendations  addressed  in  the  PSWAC  report  of
1996.  Then,  in  December  2005  the  FCC  sent  a  Report  to  Congress  On  the  Study
to  Assess  Short-Term  and  Long-Term  Needs  for  Allocations  of  Additional  Portions

of  the  Electromagnetic  Spectrum  for  Federal,  State  and  Local  Emergency  Response
Providers. This report was submitted pursuant to P.L. 108–458, the Intelligence Re-
form and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. In its conclusion, the FCC stated: ‘‘First,
as  to  the  operation  and  administration  of  a  potential  nationwide  inter-operable
broadband  mobile  communications  network  based  upon  input  from  federal,  State,
local  and  regional  emergency  response  providers,  emergency  response  providers
would benefit from the development of an integrated, inter-operable nationwide net-
work  capable  of  delivering  broadband  services  throughout  the  country.  Second,  as
to  the  use  of  commercial  wireless  technologies,  while  commercial  wireless  tech-
nologies and services are not appropriate for every type of public safety communica-
tion,  there  may  now  be  a  place  for  commercial  providers  to  assist  public  safety  in
securing and protecting the homeland.’’

For  the  above  stated  reasons,  the  National  Public  Safety  Telecommunications
Council  [a  resource  and  advocate  for  public  safety  organizations  in  the  United
States  on  matters  relating  to  public  safety  telecommunications]  has  filed  comments
with the FCC in support of reallocating 30 MHz of spectrum in the upper 700 MHz
band,  currently  slated  for  auction,  to  create  a  public/private  nationwide  broadband
network  to  be  managed  by  public  safety  for  the  benefit  of  public  safety.  The  filing
states: ‘‘In an era where government preparedness is crucial, there is no nationwide
public  safety  network  to  manage  and  coordinate  response.  There  is  no  wide  scale
broadband  technology  capability  to  expedite  analysis  and  information  sharing  crit-
ical  to  emergency  assistance,  investigation  and  apprehension.  Not  only  is  the  cur-
rent  public  safety  spectrum  so  congested  as  to  constrain  voice—much  less  permit
broadband use for video and data, limited funding hinders the incremental improve-
ments  that  can  be  made  and  which  are  only  pursued  on  a  system  by  system  basis.
That  which  is  possible  in  communications  today  and  what  public  safety  agencies
have  available  reflects  an  enormous  divide.  The  result  is  tangible:  slowed  and  hin-
dered  response  across  all  services  which  puts  lives  at  risk  and  property  in  danger.
‘‘Although legacy systems will continue to play an important role in public safety
communications,  the  opportunity  presented  by  the  yet  to  be  auctioned  700  MHz
channels  is  emphatic.  Without  this  additional  spectrum,  there  can  be  no  national
public  safety  network  connecting  all  agencies.  Using  broadband  technologies  to
transmit  information  across  agencies  and  miles  immediately  will  be  the  exception.
Public safety communications will come up short in meeting its challenges.’’

The IAFC is a member of the governing board of NPSTC and an active participant
in  all  of  its  proceedings.  The  IAFC  fully  concurs  with  the  statements  of  support  by
NPSTC  for  the  establishment  of  a  nation-wide,  public/private,  broadband  network
that will harness the innovative power of the private sector but be managed by pub-
lic safety for the benefit of public safety.
PUBLIC SAFETY BROADBAND REQUIREMENTS

In 1997, Congress addressed part of the issue of additional spectrum by directing
the  FCC  to  allocate  24  MHz  in  the  upper  700  MHz  band  for  use  by  public  safety.
As  a  result  of  the  Deficit  Reduction  Act  (P.L.  109–171),  which  passed  last  year  at
this time, this spectrum will finally become available for our use in February 2009.
As was originally intended, it is to provide, for individual licensees, 12 MHz of voice
channels  and  12  MHz  of  wideband  data  channels.  Fire  and  police  departments  are
now  in  the  planning  process  of  building  communications  systems  utilizing  this  new
spectrum. Broadband capability for public safety, identified in the 1996 PSWAC re-
port, is a vital and growing need for fire and police agencies. It is the next step fol-
lowing  the  allocation  and  implementation  of  the  24  MHz  designed  to  alleviate  cur-
rent spectrum congestion and provide inter-operability. To meet the broadband need
for public safety, the following requirements are established:

A nationwide, broadband network covering 99 percent of the population, 65 per-
cent  of  the  land  mass,  most  of  the  critical  infrastructure,  and  a  network  that
supports urban, suburban and rural communities.
A network large enough to draw commercial support which is requisite for a na-
tionwide network to be affordable for public safety.
A network built using next generation technology.
A  network  built  to  public  safety  ruggedness  specifications  to  ensure  reliability
under severely adverse conditions.
A network governed by public safety.
A network which ensures priority access for public safety.

PUBLIC SAFETY USES OF NATIONWIDE BROADBAND NETWORK

72

The Public Safety Broadband Trust proposal provides public safety with enormous

potential that does not currently exist.

A  hardened  public  safety  network  would  make  possible  nationwide  roaming  and
inter-operability  for  public  safety  agencies  at  the  federal  (e.g.,  U.S.  Coast  Guard),
State  (e.g.,  highway  patrol),  and  local  (e.g.,  police,  fire/EMS)  levels.  It  would  give
public safety access to satellite services where terrestrial services either do not exist
or  are  temporarily  out  of  service.  The  network  build-out  would  give  rural  areas—
for  the  first  time—broadband  coverage  and  provided  public  safety  there  a  commu-
nications  tool  that  would  be  virtually  impossible  because  of  cost  under  any  other
scenario.  In  addition,  this  new  network  will  protect  nuclear  power  plants,  dams,
railroads  and  pipelines  and  other  parts  of  the  Nation’s  critical  infrastructure  in
rural areas.

There are a number of technologies that are available today that fire departments
would  use—more  will  be  developed,  especially  if  an  affordable  broadband  network
is available. Some examples are:

Transmitting  video,  photographs,  blueprints  and  other  information  both  to  and
from an incident command post.
Advanced  paging  systems  particularly  useful  for  summoning  volunteer  fire-
fighters/medics.
Mesh enabled architecture (MEA) for non-GPS broadband location system.
Fireground accountability systems—biometrics as well as location.
Smart building downloads enroute to an alarm.
Enhanced GIS mapping capability for building locations, critical infrastructure,
target hazards, water systems, transportation systems, etc.
Personal  Area  Networks  linking  a  portable  radio  carried  by  a  firefighter  to
many  useful  and  lifesaving  accessories  including  a  helmet  video  camera,  video
viewing  device,  health  monitor,  wireless  self  contained  breathing  apparatus
(SCBA) microphone and speaker, or a handheld computer.
Vehicular  Area  Networks  that  could  link  a  vehicle’s  radio  to  laptop  computers,
printers, remote headsets, bar code readers, and cameras.
Medical video and high-resolution image transmissions from the scene of an in-
cident  to  the  emergency  department  of  a  hospital  where  physicians  can  assess
patient status and give on-scene and enroute treatment instructions.
PDAs for fire department leaders or for all firefighters.

A ONE–TIME OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE RIGHT THING

Senator McCain has announced his intension to introduced legislation to establish
a Public Safety Broadband Trust. The trust will be composed of public safety organi-
zations  to  hold  a  single  license  for  30  MHz  of  broadband  spectrum  to  create  a  na-
tionwide, public/private broadband network. The trust also will be the management
group  to  oversee  the  policies,  procedures  and  practices  of  the  network.  In  other
words,  the  public  safety  trust  will  run  the  network  for  the  benefit  of  public  safety.
The  30  MHz  of  spectrum  that  is  being  considered  is  immediately  adjacent  to  the
24  MHz  of  spectrum  allocated  to  public  safety  in  1997  and  which  will  be  available
in 2009. This has considerable advantage over any other spectrum since radio com-
munication  devices  can  be  dual  purpose  with  the  spectrum  so  close.  This  spectrum
in  the  upper  700  MHz  is  also  near  existing  public  safety  which  is  being  relocated
in the lower 800 MHz band.

This  30  MHz  of  spectrum  is  currently  slated  for  auction.  The  Deficit  Reduction
Act  of  2005  requires  the  FCC  to  auction  this  spectrum  by  January  2008.  Without
legislation taking this out of the auction and allocating it for the public safety trust,
this one-time opportunity will be lost forever.
CALL FOR ACTION

The  Congress  of  the  United  States  has  a  one-time  opportunity,  in  the  near-term,
to  provide  public  safety  with  a  nationwide,  broadband  network.  In  order  to  be  af-
fordable for public safety, the network would have to have viable commercial capac-
ity  of  about  30  MHz  of  spectrum.  The  network  would  be  built  to  public  safety  rug-
gedness  specifications.  A  Public  Safety  Broadband  Trust  would  be  created  to  hold
the single license from the FCC for the 30 MHz of spectrum and would oversee man-
agement  of  the  network.  While  the  network  volume  would  be  largely  commercial,
public safety agencies would use what it needed with a built-in priority status. Com-

mercial use also ensures that sufficient capital will be available for maintaining the
system and upgrading and refreshing newer technologies when they come along.

We urge the members of this committee to take the first action to create this Pub-
lic  Safety  Broadband  Trust  by  promptly  reporting  legislation  to  take  30  MHz  from
the  pending  auction  and  direct  the  FCC  to  reallocate  it  to  public  safety.  We  cannot
suggest  too  strongly  the  urgent  and  identified  need  for  broadband  capability  that
public  safety  can  use  with  assurance  that  it  will  work  when  needed,  be  available
when  needed,  and  is  affordable.  With  a  global  war  on  terrorism  being  fought  daily
and  homeland  security  interest  at  an  all-time  high,  public  safety,  in  defense  of  the
homeland,  should  be  operating  on  21st  Century  technology.  Thank  you  for  the  op-
portunity  to  address  the  committee.  We  appreciate  your  consideration  of  this  most
important public safety issue.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you  very  much,  Ms.  Ward.  We  open  the
first  round  of  questions,  and  the  Chair  recognizes  himself  for  five
minutes.

Under Secretary Cohen, I understand that you all in the S&T Di-
rectorate  are  working  on  a  strategic  plan,  and  I  would  like  to  ask
you  about  the  status  of  the  development  of  this  strategic  plan  and
the  extent  to  which  a  formal  risk  assessment  will  play  a  role  in
your strategic planning.

Mr.  COHEN.  Yes,  sir,  Mr.  Chairman.  As  I  have  previously  testi-
fied this year to the Homeland Security Committee, I owe the Con-
gress two strategic plans. One is for the directorate itself, and that
will be risk informed and customer focused. And some of the other
panel members here have already discussed the importance of that.
I  have  committed  to  the  Congress  that  you  will  have  that  by  June
of this year.

The second that I owe was mandated by the enabling legislation.
This is a much broader strategic plan, and it recognizes the wisdom
of  the  enabling  legislation  where  you  did  not  want  me  to  recreate
the  National  Institute  of  Health,  did  not  want  me  to  recreate  the
DOE  or  DOE  labs,  you  did  not  want  me  to  recreate  the  National
Science  Foundation.  But  you  did  give  me  a  preeminent  position  to
go  ahead  and  leverage  those  tens  of  billions  of  dollars  of  research
where  those  other  agencies  and  departments  of  government  must
share  with  me  the  results  of  that  critical  research  so  that  I  can
take  my  precious  investment  and  focus  those  results  on  Homeland
Security requirements and needs.

That  government-wide  strategic  plan  was  in  preparation  appar-
ently for about two years. Because the approach it took, and I have
reviewed  it  myself  in  draft  form,  was  more  perceived  by  the  other
departments  and  agencies  as  mandated  what  they  would  do  for
Homeland Security, as to how they, through their efforts could con-
tribute  to  Homeland  Security,  I  think  it  had  a  very  difficult  time
coming  to  fruition.  I  commit  by  the  end  of  this  fiscal  year  I  will

have to the Administration that strategic plan that is a partnership
across government for them then to provide to the Congress.

Chairman  WU.  Mr.  Under  Secretary,  what  I  heard  you  to  say  is
that  the  first  strategic  plan  that  you  are  going  to  be  working  out
is  going  to  be  informed  by  shall  we  say  less  formal  risk  analysis.
Do  you  have  some  plan  at  this  point  or  some  point  in  the  future
to do a more systematic formal risk analysis to inform the research
priorities of DHS?

Mr. COHEN. Yes, sir. And, in fact, that is in place right now. The
reorganization that I put in place where the majority of my budget
goes  in  an  integrated  product  team,  to  the  customer,  whether  that
is border patrol, Coast Guard, cyber security, or infrastructure pro-
tection  with  the  National  Infrastructure  Plan,  each  of  those  cus-
tomers  does  a  risk-based  analysis  to  determine  what  capabilities
they need to fulfill their homeland security mission. Now, you wise-
ly  gave  us  the  Homeland  Security  Institute.  In  the  short  time  I
have  been  on  board  I  have  reoriented  them  to  bring  operations  re-
search,  operations  analysis,  and  make  the  Homeland  Security  In-
stitute  the  risk-based  analysis  determiner  for  all  of  my  22  cus-
tomers.  So  when  I  sit  down  and  integrate  a  project  team  and  my
division  director,  along  with  the  customer  and  the  acquisition  pro-
vider,  we  have  11  capstone  IPTs.  You  see  the  capabilities  they  are
trying  to  provide.  The  customer  working  with  us  then  prioritizes
what  they  need  to  do  their  job  based  on  the  risks  as  they  see  it.
We  then  commit  through  technology  agreement  in  writing  where
they  hold  me  to  cost,  schedule,  and  capability  metrics  to  provide
the enablers for their people, process, and product. Because that is
how they do their job.

Chairman WU. Mr. Under Secretary.
Mr. COHEN. On a bigger scale——
Chairman  WU.  Mr.  Under  Secretary,  because  my  time  is

expiring——

Mr.  COHEN.  On  a  bigger  scale,  I  will  answer  your  question  di-
rectly. I have sat down with the National Academies of Science be-
cause, and the other Members may feel differently here, the science
of risk is not well known, and I have asked the National Academies
to  work  with  me  so  I  can  fund  how  we  can  better  determine  risks
for the issues that have been raised here.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you  very  much  for  focusing  on  that  part
of  the  question.  With  the  forbearance  of  the  Ranking  Member,  a
few  seconds  after  my  time  has  expired,  since  you  have  brought  up
this  chart,  I  wanted  to  ask  you  about  the  IPT.  You  know,  I  think
it is terrific that the different federal agencies have been pulled to-
gether  in  this.  I  have  to  say  that  there  have  been  concerns  ex-
pressed, perhaps some complaints, that some of the end users, and
you refer to them in your testimony, and the first responders, that
some of their needs in terms of usability, in terms of maintenance,
you  know,  the  ability  to  withstand  challenges  in  the  field  and
prioritization  of  devices  and  threats,  that  that  has  not  been  paid
sufficiently  close  attention  to,  shall  we  say.  And  that  a  specific  ex-
ample  would  be  the,  what  many  of  us  would  consider,  you  know,
shoulder-fired anti-air missiles in this town, MANPADS, man port-
able  air  defense  systems,  that  the  system  that  was  developed  is
roughly  a  million  dollars  a  copy.  The  folks  who  would  be  respon-

76

sible  for  purchasing  them  and  maintaining  them  are  reluctant  to
make  that  investment.  Do  we  have  a  problem  here  with  a  lack  of
linkage with the ultimate user?

Mr.  COHEN.  I  will  give  a  concise  answer.  Yes.  This  is  an  area
that  I  am  very  much  focused  on.  The  enabling  legislation  not  only
made  the  head  of  the  S&T  Directorate,  but  you  made  me  the  test
and  evaluation  executive  for  the  entire  Department,  and  you  put
standards, not just inter-operability, but all standards under me for
the  entire  Department.  In  the  IPT  process  you  can  see  the  bottom
of  each  diamond  has  the  customer,  the  guardsmen,  fill  in  the
blank.

Chairman WU. Above the line, those are solid lines, that is a dot-

ted line down below, and I don’t know who to interpret that.

Mr.  COHEN.  Yes,  sir.  Because  S&T  is  like  the  BASF  commercial
you  see  every  Sunday  morning.  I  don’t  make  the  widget.  I  make
the widget better. My other panel members already noted, S&T for
S&T’s  sake  does  not  satisfy  the  customer  nor  does  it  reduce  the
risk  to  this  country.  And  so  what  I  have  done  in  some  cases  be-
cause they are internal to DHS, I have mandated, because it is my
process,  the  customer,  the  customer  be  there.  But  I  am  not  going
to  tell  the  Commandant  of  the  Coast  Guard,  and  I  am  not  going
to  tell  the  cyber  czar,  et  cetera.  I  have  provided  for  the  customer
to customer to be at the table.

We  have  also  established,  and  it  is  operating  and  running,  tech
solutions, a website, something I did in Navy, where first respond-
ers  themselves  can  come  to  my  website  with  recommendations  or
gaps  that  they  believe  exist,  because  they  live  it  every  day,  and
they are smart people. In Navy I had a sailor who came in to from
the  Persian  Gulf  on  a  carrier  who  asked  for  a  degreasing  Zamboni
for  four  and  a  half  acres.  It  wasn’t  quite  S&T  but  we  provided  it,
using our laboratories, and that sailor I don’t think ever bought an-
other beer in his life. We are going to do the same, and I am com-
mitted  to  our  first  responders.  But  this  is  a  work  in  progress,  and
I look forward to improving it as we go forward. But you are right,
and we have got to do a better job, and I believe we are organized
to do that now, sir.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Under  Secretary.  Dr.

Gingrey.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Mr.  Under  Secretary,
Admiral  Cohen,  I  had  mentioned  in  my  opening  statement  a  very
difficult  task  to  assess  and  characterize  the  various  threats  that
our  nation  faces.  In  that  vein  I  am  interested  in  hearing  more
about  this  BioWatch  Program,  I  guess  it  is  called.  BioWatch.  Can
you  give  us  the  history  of  the  program,  its  various  successes,  and
some of the struggles and what you see as the future of BioWatch?
It  is  my  understanding  it  is  a  program  that  can  play  an  effective
and efficient role in securing our country, but there has been some
problems. So if you would talk to us about BioWatch.

Mr.  COHEN.  Yes,  sir,  Congressman.  I  am  a  big  fan  of  BioWatch.
In fact, Rita Colwell, Dr. Colwell, when she was Director of the Na-
tional  Science  Foundation,  in  the  summer  of  2001,  came  to  me  as
Chief of the Naval Research and proposed a cooperative program—
Army  DOD  with  her  for  something  very  similar  to  this,  so  that  in
our  main  cities  we  would  put  in  place  sensors  that  would  monitor

for various pathogens. Because we didn’t have a database how that
varied  diurnally  with  season,  what  the  false  alarms  were,  weather
conditions,  et  cetera.  It  didn’t  gain  traction,  and  then  we  had  911,
and then the standup of the Department of Homeland Security.

On  the  broader  issue  in  terms  of  the  priorities  and  risks,  what
I  basically  inherited  was  Mr.  Oxford  has  about  one-third  of  the
S&T  budget  for  nuclear  and  radiological.  Chem  bio  has  about  one-
third  of  the  budget.  Those  are  the  two  obvious,  clearly  defined,
major  threats,  and  all  the  other  threats  share  about  one-third  of
the budget. Is that right or wrong? I don’t know. That is follow the
money.

The  BioWatch  Program  was  established  about  four  years  ago.  It
was  intended  to  do  what  Rita  proposed.  I  don’t  know  that  they
knew she proposed it, but it was to go in about 30 of our major cit-
ies, using current technologies with fixed stations to monitor patho-
gens that we have the technology to do. And it is analog in nature.
You  know  from  your  background  we  draw  the  air  through  pads,
then  we  collect  it  weekly.  We  then  go  to  the  lab  and  do  a  detailed
analysis.

It has been highly successful. It works. We have taken over three
million  samples  of  which  we  have  gotten  15  positive  results,  all  of
them  verified  but  all  due  to  natural,  not  terrorist  causes.  In  fact,
two months ago when the stink bomb engulfed Manhattan, and we
didn’t  know  what  it  was,  smelled  like  hydrogen  sulfide,  Mayor
Bloomberg, I understand was able in the first hour to go before the
good  people  of  New  York  City  and  say  they  didn’t  know  what
caused  it,  but  it  was  not  a  threat.  That  statement  was  in  part  en-
abled by the BioWatch sensors in New York.

We  have  now  in  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security,  working
in conjunction with the Congress through the last year, established
the  Office  of  Health  Affairs.  That  is  headed  by  our  Chief  Medical
Officer,  Dr.  Runge.  Dr.  Runge  filled  in  for  me  over  the  last  six
months  before  I  came  on  board  at  S&T,  and  we  work  very  closely
together.  This  is  an  area  where  S&T  didn’t  have  a  customer  in
DHS.  Now  I  have  a  customer,  and  so  my  budget  this  year  reflects
a one-time transfer of approximately $80 million to Dr. Runge and
the Office of Health Affairs, because that is what it costs to operate
BioWatch II, which is in operation.

Now,  we  will  continue  to  do  S&T  to  improve  that  system,  but
with Dr. Vitko and the rest of my chem bio division, we are leaping
ahead. We are leaping ahead to BioWatch III. This brings the cur-
rent  digital  technologies,  the  microchips  that  will  allow  us,  we  be-
lieve,  when  fielded,  and  we  hope  to  have  it  fielded  within  the  next
three to four years, the ability to have real time monitoring coupled
with wireless and hopefully because it is one quarter the cost to op-
erate, four times the sensors in many more cities——

Mr. GINGREY. Yeah.
Mr. COHEN.—so that——
Mr. GINGREY. I know my time is running out, Admiral.
Mr. COHEN. Sure.
Mr.  GINGREY.  But  in  the  remaining  few  seconds,  tell  us  some  of
the  particular  things  that  you  would  be  monitoring  for  that  the
general public would be aware of, things like sarin gas as an exam-
ple,  or  anthrax  or  something  that  we  read  about.  Fortunately,  on

not  a  common  occasion,  but  it  scares  the  bejesus  out  of  everybody.
Tell  us  some  of  the  things  that  you  are  watching  for  in  these  30
cities.

Mr.  COHEN.  Yes,  sir.  I  will  leave  it  very  limited  in  this  form  be-
cause  you  are  aware  that  we  did  put  out  earlier  or  late  last  year
a  major  threat  determination  on  30  different  pathogens,  using  a
very  detailed  risk  determination,  probability  of  occurrence  times
consequence of occurrence. But it is safe to say that anthrax, botu-
lism,  some  of  the  more  common  diseases  that  could  be  pandemic
are monitored for.

Mr. GINGREY. They are part of that watch?
Mr. COHEN. Yes, sir.
Mr.  GINGREY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Under  Secretary,  and  thank  you,

Mr. Chairman, and I look forward to the second round.
Chairman WU. Thank you, Dr. Gingrey. Mr. Mitchell.
Mr.  MITCHELL.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Wu.  Mr.  Under  Secretary,
much  of  the  Secure  Borders  Initiatives  Systems  development  has
been  completed  by  S&T.  How  have  you  insured  that  the  Secure
Borders  Initiative  has  responded  to  the  needs  of  customs  and  bor-
der patrol agents along the Southwest border?

Mr. COHEN. Well, Congressman, the borders are clearly very im-
portant  to  us,  and  it  has  been  a  major  S&T  initiative.  Secretary
Chertoff has testified numerous times that the current contract for
the  SBI  went  with  proven  technology  so  that  it  could  be  fielded  in
a timely manner. I know you are well aware of this because of the
towers  and  the  other  aspects  that  are  being  deployed  in  Arizona
and other Southwest borders. In our integrated product team which
you  see  border  security,  both  the  customs  and  border  protection
and ICE are my chairmen, and it is Chief Aguilar himself who sits
at that table with my border and maritime Merv Leavitt, Director.
And  it  is  Chief  Aguilar  and  ICE  who  tell  us  what  they  need  to
make the borders better. We slave it to that.

Now,  these,  Congressmen,  are  incremental  improvements.  These
are  spiral  development.  Maybe  we  can  move  the  towers  from  five-
mile  spacing  to  seven  and  a  half  mile  spacing  but  with  the  same
fidelity  to  insure  the  safety  of  the  border.  And  we  are  doing  that.
I  am  investing  into  that,  but  in  my  high-risk  portfolio  where  Dr.
Epstein  talked  about  the  need  to  take  risks  and  fail,  we  have  sev-
eral  programs.  Tunnel  vision,  tunnel  detection.  No  one  has  been
able  to  do  this  in  a  timely  manner.  We  are  going  to  risk,  we  may
fail, but in fact, and I think you know him from Tucson, Tony Mul-
ligan, in Advanced Ceramics, is proposing using Silver Fox, a small
24-pound  unmanned  aerial  vehicle,  and  using,  I  am  not  going  to
give  the  technology,  but  fly  that  along  the  border  to  see  if  we  can
detect  tunnels  down  to  several  hundred  feet.  Will  it  work?  I  don’t
know.  Stay  tuned.  But  I  get  to  do  that.  We  are  also  using  per-
sistent surveillance. These are 24-hour, high-end UAVs, unmanned
aerial  vehicles.  We  are  using  them  for  several  reasons.  One,  as
counter  MANPADS.  As  the  Chairman  said,  the  airlines  are  not
high  on  the  cost  or  the  maintenance  of  the  impact  of  counter
MANPADS on their aircraft. So we are looking to use a 65,000 foot
decoy to take the MANPADS away from the aircraft. But this same
decoy  can  be  used  with  state-of-the-art  day,  night  video  to  give  us
persistent  surveillance  as  we  have  overseas  in  war  on  our  borders

for  our  border  patrol.  And  it  can  also  be  used  as  a  bounce  link  to
have  secure  communications,  reliable  communications  in  that  last
mile  for  a  distant  franchise,  first  responders.  I  know  your  time  is
short. What I am telling you is we are taking the low risk and the
high risk at the same time to make the borders more secure.

Mr.  MITCHELL.  Thank  you.  Just  one  follow  up.  Has  the  border
patrol  expressed  the  need  for  any  research  and  development  that
has not been completed yet?

Mr.  COHEN.  Absolutely.  In  fact,  one  of  the  things  that  I  liked,
please  put  that  up,  about  this  Integrated  Product  Team  Process,
and  I  learned  this  in  Navy,  this  is  not  new,  is  when  you  have  the
customer  at  the  table,  they  always  have,  I  know  this  is  hard  for
Congress to believe, always have more requirements than we have
money  or  technology  to  fill.  And  so  we  ask  the  customer  to
prioritize.  Now,  here  you  are  seeing  my  human  factors.  My  people
screening.  In  the  upper  left  that  is  what  I  am  funding.  These  are
all prioritized. In the lower right I am funding for those in the out
years. It goes to the issue that was raised by Ms. Ward. I am doing
six-year  funding,  and  I  am  showing  OMB,  and  I  am  showing  the
Hill  how  we  are  sequentially  going  to  invest.  And  as  more  money
becomes  available,  those  items  below  the  cut  line  put  there  by
Chief Aguilar, get raised, because I can do them. But the ones that
we are doing in zero to three years, when they are delivered, I rein-
vest  that  money  in  the  items  below  the  line,  and  they  naturally
move up over the six-year budget period.

Mr. MITCHELL. One last quick follow up. How has, there is a pro-
posed  cut  in  the  border  and  maritime  division  of  about  seven  and
a  half  percent.  How  will  this  cut  affect  the  research  that  is  being
done there?

Mr.  COHEN.  Congressman,  in  going  to  the  new  organizational
construct, I have basic research, which I am growing. It was at five
percent. My goal in my tenure is to get it to 20 percent for the rea-
sons  you  heard  Dr.  Epstein  address.  Fifty  percent  of  my  budget
goes  to  the  Integrated  Product  Team,  the  immediate  improvement
for  my  22  customers,  but  10  percent  goes  to  innovation.  It  is  the
high-risk portfolio. So what I have done with Merv Levitt and with
the  Commandant,  is  we  have  taken  some  of  the  monies  that  were
in  what  we  call  on  and  on  research,  no  defined  customer,  and  we
now have Merv Levitt in borders and maritime with a defined cus-
tomer  requirement  and  the  high  risk.  And  so  what  I  have  done  is
it has been an internal transfer of money from that division to my
innovation  portfolio.  But  the  monies  are  fundamentally  the  same,
sir. Just differences in risks and time of delivery.

Mr. MITCHELL. Thank you. I yield my time.
Chairman  WU.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Mitchell.  Now  my  good  friend
from Texas, Mr. Hall, the Ranking Member of the Full Committee.
Mr. HALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I think that I probably
want  to  start  off,  Admiral,  by  thanking  you  and  thanking  you  for
all  the  wonderful  work  you  have  done,  not  just  for  this  committee
and  for  this  thrust  but  for  this  country.  I  know  your  background.
You  are  a  graduate  of  the  Naval  Academy.  I  never  could  have  got
in there, much less getting out. You were MIT, you were Navy Con-
gressional  liaison.  You  have  done  it  all,  and  I  don’t  know  of  any-
body more qualified for what you are doing and doing it right than

anybody under the Capitol Dome, and I want to thank you for that.
We are lucky to have you.

I have a question for you and for Mr. Oxford, and I guess maybe
it is general, but just what tools and what procedures are available
through  your  offices  to  help  State  and  local  governments,  the  peo-
ple  at  the  bottom,  to  help  them  assess  and  address  their  own
vulnerabilities to natural and to manmade disasters? And how can
interested communities interface with expertise as housed in DHS,
and  how  do  you  get  it  from  your  mind  down  to  their  mind  and  to
help  us  defend  that  that  they  are  obligated  to  defend  just  like  you
are  at  the  top?  Would  you  give  me  something  like  that  in  the  last
three minutes I have?

Mr.  COHEN.  Yes,  sir.  First  of  all,  I  want  to  thank  you  for  your
very  kind  words,  but  I  also  want  to  thank  you  for  your  long  and
dedicated  service  and  especially  your  focus  on  science  and  edu-
cation. I would like to remind you that our greatest Admiral, Admi-
ral  Nimitz,  was  a  Texan  from  Fredericksburg,  and  my  only  regret
in life is that I am not a long horn.

Mr. HALL. I was a JG when I served under him. I didn’t get any

closer than 100 yards of him, but I sure did admire him.

Mr. COHEN. Yes, sir. I am going to give you a fairly succinct an-
swer. The first responders and the communities are not at the bot-
tom in my book. They are at the top, and I exist to fulfill and serve
their requirements. We have many, many ways to do that. I briefed
the  Tech  Solutions  website,  which  I  put  online,  where  they  can
come  in  directly.  I  have  established  in  my  organization,  very  lean
agency,  because  my  responsibilities  run  throughout  all  Federal
Government and also international. I was going to have an associa-
tion,  because  I  have  to  deal  with  the  sheriff  in  Mayberry,  and  I
have  to  deal  with  the  New  York  City  Police  Department.  And  I
have  to  deal  with  the  Tribal  firemen,  and  I  have  to  deal  with  the
Chicago  Fire  Department.  That  scale  is  very  difficult  for  me,  but
as  Ms.  Ward  has  indicated,  this  is  the  role  of  the  associations.  We
in  Homeland  Security  have,  in  the  Department,  not  in  my  direc-
torate, and I think that is appropriate, groups that reach out to pri-
vate  industry,  groups  that  reach  out  to  associations,  sit  down  with
them.  They  then  pass  those  needs  to  me.  But  as  I  said  in  my  con-
firmation,  my  door  is  always  open.  At  the  end  of  the  day  the  22
components  and  agencies,  border  patrol,  Coast  Guard,  who  deal,
who live in those communities, they bring to me their requirements
tailored  for  those  communities.  This  is  a  very  difficult  issue.  We
have  got  35,000  fire  departments  of  which  80  percent  are  volun-
teer.  This  is  how  America  works.  This  is  the  beauty  but  also  the
challenge  of  America.  It  is  a  new  department.  It  is  a  work  in
progress.  I  do  think  we  are  getting  wind  under  our  wings,  though,
sir.

Mr.  HALL.  Are  you  actually  in  touch  with  these  folks?  Do  they
know  a  number  that  they  can  call?  Do  they  know  how  to  call  for
help if they see something that concerns them?

Mr.  COHEN.  I  would  say  that  some  do.  I  would  say  the  majority
don’t.  I  would  tell  you  that  I  am  not  proud  of  the  Homeland  Secu-
rity Department website.

Mr. HALL. But if I know you, you are working on it.
Mr. COHEN. I am. You bet. Yes, sir.

Mr.  HALL.  And  thank  you  for  that.  I  thank  every  one  of  you  for
not  just  being  here  today  but  for  how  you  got  here  today,  and  I
have  made  this  statement  before.  I  would  have  known  all  of  you
and would have admired you, but I wouldn’t have liked any of you
because  you  are  the  very  people  that  run  the  curves  for  guys  like
me  in  college.  But  I  thank  you  for  your  participation,  and  I  thank
you for what you are doing for this country. All of you. I yield back,
Chairman Wu.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Hall.  And  the  Chair

now recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.

Mr. CHANDLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Admiral, I also appre-
ciate  your  service.  Unlike  our,  my  friend,  the  Ranking  Member
from  Texas  who  has  obviously  Texas  has  somewhat  of  a  tradition
with  the  Navy,  with  Admiral  Nimitz,  I  am  afraid  Kentucky’s  his-
toric association with the Navy is not that great, despite our enor-
mous coastline.

Mr. COHEN. With Ohio.
Mr.  CHANDLER.  Yes,  sir.  That  is  right.  The  Ohio  Ocean.  Mr.
Under  Secretary,  I  am  interested  in  a  cut,  a  proposed  cut  in  the
budget request having to do with University Centers of Excellence.
I  noticed  that  the  number,  the  FY  2006,  number  was  $62  million;
in  FY  2007,  enacted  $48  million.  Now,  the  suggestion  is  down  to
38  million,  and  in  addition  to  what  is  a  fairly  substantial  cut,
there,  as  I  understand  it  there  is  also  a  proposal  to  spread  that
money  over  more  universities.  Could  you  give  me  some  indication
as  to  the  thinking  there,  and  will  the  money  when  it  is  watered
down  in  that  way  or,  you  know,  less  to  each  place,  will  that  yield
as  strong  a  result  as  you  have  been  getting  from  those  programs?
Mr.  COHEN.  Yes,  sir.  And  you  will  never  heard  me  say  less  is
more.  This  is  something  I  testified  to  two  weeks  ago  with  the
Homeland  Security  Committee.  You  may  remember  when  I  came
on board last August there was some less than complimentary lan-
guage  in  the  pending  Congressional  legislation  about  my  direc-
torate and more specifically about the Centers of Excellence. Work-
ing  with  both  sides  of  the  aisle  and  both  Houses,  authorizers  and
appropriators, we were able to find a solution. But for the Centers
of  Excellence,  draconian  measures  were  about  to  be  taken  because
of the perceived under-performance as they were organized prior to
my  arrival.  The  legislation  that  came  out  I  am  very  thankful  for.
It  required  me  to  come  back  to  the  appropriators,  both  House  and
Senate, within 60 days of enactment, which I did on the 58th day.
Chairman,  I  can  meet  some  schedules.  And  explain  how  we  were
going forward. With my new organizational construct it has six di-
vision and three investment areas of basic research, product transi-
tion,  and  high-risk  innovation.  Everything  is  aligned  to  explosives,
chem bio, command, control, inter-operability, to borders maritime,
to  human  factors,  and  infrastructure  and  geophysical  sciences.
That  is  how  I  do  business  overlaid  by  matrix  portfolio  directors  so
we don’t have stovepipes. In September of last year I sat down with
all  the  directors  of  the  existing  seven  COEs  and  asked  them  to
align with one or more division so I could justify their existence in
the basic research. They immediately did that, and I am very proud
of  that.  But  at  that  same  time  the  Congress  advised  me,  and  I
looked  at  my  own  six  divisions,  have  we  got  the  vertical?  Yeah.

Would  you  turn  that  for  the  Congressman,  please,  just  so  we  can
see  it  better?  I  had  two  divisions  that  were  lacking  any  Centers  of
Excellence,  and  they  were  critically  important.  Explosives.  And  so
today I have four broad agency announcements, competitive in na-
ture, to fill those areas that I knew the Congress wanted me to do.
And we have consolidated.

On  the  Administration  side,  the  Administration  and  the  Depart-
ment  and  OMB,  looking  at  that  pending  legislation,  which  would
have decimated the COEs, went ahead and removed as part of the
budget development a majority of that funding. That was unaccept-
able  to  me,  and  so  I  was  working,  as  I  said  in  testimony,  a  two-
front  battle.  On  one  hand  I  had  the  Congress  telling  the  Adminis-
tration  they  are  going  to  do  away  with  it,  and  on  the  other  hand
I  had  the  Administration  saying,  not  even  the  Congress  values
them.  I  was  able  to  buy  back,  as  you  can  see,  80  percent  of  what
I had the previous year. With this new alignment I guarantee you,
and I use that word rarely, that with the product you will see com-
ing  out  of  basic  research,  the  universities  and  the  associated  lab-
oratories  including  Silicone  Hollow,  which  we  are  very  pleased  to
be involved with, I believe you will see, the administration will un-
derstand  the  value  of  this,  its  dual  use,  and  we  will  grow  that
budget.

Mr. CHANDLER. Thank you, Admiral. It sounds like you have put
a  lot  of  thought  into  this,  and  so  you  got,  what  you  are  saying  is
you  got  what  you  could  get  by  what  appears  to  be  a  lot  of  hard
work.

Mr. COHEN. Yes, sir.
Mr.  CHANDLER.  I  have  got  one  other  question,  if  I  may,  Mr.
Chairman. And this is I think better answered by Dr. Epstein pos-
sibly. The S&T Directorate seems to have a strong focus on biologi-
cal  threats  that  are  human  caused,  things  like  anthrax,  smallpox,
that  sort  of  thing.  Do  you  think  that  this,  and  I  understand  how
important  those  are,  is  this  in  your  view  the  main  priority,  or
should  the  priority,  or  should  we  be,  are  we  doing  enough,  let  me
ask  it  that  way,  are  we  doing  enough  to  prepare  for  natural
threats, naturally occurring threats? For instance, the avian flu.

Dr.  EPSTEIN.  I  think  I  will  echo  Under  Secretary  Cohen’s  reply
that we are never doing enough. There is a lot of threats out there.
One challenge with this particular question is that natural threats,
well,  let  me  back  up.  There  is  two  different  Cabinet  departments
involved,  and  so  part  of  the  challenge  is  not  just  determining  how
much  money  needs  to  go  to  it,  but  what  is  the  relative  role  of  the
two departments. And the point I make here is that there is no cor-
rect  way  to  make  that  boundary.  These  are  both,  at  least  on  the
bio-terrorism  side,  a  bio-terrorist  attack  is  an  intentional  attack,
and it is a disease. You have got one Cabinet department to worry
about  disease.  You  have  got  another  one  that  worries  about  inten-
tional attacks, and they will both have to be involved. I think it is
appropriate that the bio-terror focus that the Department of Home-
land  Security  has  is  there.  I  think  it  is  appropriate  that  is  their
largest  program.  When  one  looks  out  into  the  future  and  says,  all
the  ways  that  technology  can  be  abused  by  folks  who  have  ill-in-
tent,  what  are  the  capabilities  that  might  put  the  most  power  in
the  hands  of  the  smallest  groups  in  the  most  places.  Biological

weapons  are  certainly  one  that  is  a  serious  problem.  No  matter
how  serious  one  thinks  it  is  today,  it  is  not  getting  any  better  in
the future.

The  pandemic  natural  disease  problem,  again,  it  is  something
that  we  have  to  expect  we  will  see.  Parts  of  the  government  are
mobilized  to  do  it,  and  I,  it  is  hard  to  give  a  short  answer  as  to
whether  we  have  the  right  balance.  I  mean,  I  think  they  are  both
important, and I think they both are getting attention, and we just
need to keep our eyes open to them.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you  very  much.  The  gentleman  from

Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, thank you. When I asked the Admiral
a  question  that  I  asked  a  few  moments  ago,  I  noticed  Ms.  Ward
gave  me  an  eyebrow  there,  and  I  want  to  follow  up  with  her  and
leave  little  enough  time  for  Mr.  Oxford  maybe  to  tag  onto  it,  too,
because  I  asked  those  two  the  question,  but  I  think  you  probably
have more real experience at the level that I am talking about, be-
cause I note in your background that you have been in the trenches
at  the  local  level,  and  you  were  in  the  city  management  business
for the city of Orlando. Probably, I was stationed there in 1943, at
Daytona Beach, and drive over to Orlando. The magnificent growth
at  that  time,  you  were  part  of  that.  And  city  managers  are  kind
of  like  tail  gunners.  They  are  usually  removed  after  each  mission,
and  if  you  survived  that,  you  had  a  lot  of  good  experience  there.

I want to ask you——
Ms. WARD. It has changed a lot.
Mr.  HALL.—to  help  us  with  that.  I  note  that  you  were  a  task
force  leader.  You  were  a  coordinator  of  a  regional  area,  and  you
have  been  early  days  in  public  safety.  Now,  for  a  little  community
like Blackland or Munson in my home, I live in the smallest county
in  Texas  of  254  counties,  and  we  would  be  a  great  one  to  test  to
see  how  far  really  what  the  Admiral’s  working  23  hours  a  day  on,
reaches  us.  Give  me  some  ideas  as  to  how  we  can,  I  can  tell  folks
there  that  I  see  day  in  and  day  out,  that  I  go  to  church  with  and
see on the streets, how they could benefit from what all five of you
are doing?

Ms.  WARD.  I  was  very  happy  to  hear  the  Admiral  acknowledge
the  fact  that  some  of  the  local  people  probably  don’t  know  what  is
going on, because that is a very true statement. That is one of the
benefits  of  the  group  that  I  belong  to,  and  I  had  not  seen  the  tech
solutions  website  and  will  be  happy  to  provide  outreach  to  the
membership  and  their  members  so  that  they  will  know  that  that
is  available.  That  is  one  of  the  hardest  things  that  we  deal  with
is getting back down to the trenches.

Mr.  HALL.  It  is  the  figures,  the  numbers  alone  just  are  stulti-

fying.

Ms.  WARD.  That  is  correct.  And  that  is  actually  the  value  of  our

group, the NPSTC group.

Mr. HALL. Yes.
Ms.  WARD.  Our  associations  represent  all  of  these  people,  so
what  we  end  up  working  with  SAFECOM  on,  goes  back  into  our
associations, and then is funneled down to the lowest level, includ-
ing  the  volunteer  fire  departments  that  were  referenced  earlier.
That  is  why  we  are  hoping  that  this  esteemed  group  will  see  the

value of what we do with the SAFECOM group, take into consider-
ation  the  9/11  Commission’s  recommendation,  Secretary  Chertoff
has  also  said  that  inter-operability  is  going  to  be  one  of  the  major
issues  to  get  resolved  and  kind  of  not  dilute  the  message  that  we,
and  our  mission  by  changing  the  personality  of  SAFECOM.  Be-
cause those people that work in your community, the public safety
people,  the  only  way  they  are  going  to  be  able  to  get  reached  is
through  some  mechanism  where  the  State  and  local  people  have
input into what is going on here in Washington. And I will tell you,
you  know,  I  come  from  local  government.  I  would  never  have  any
funding  to  be  sitting  in  this  chair  from  Orange  County  where  I
worked or the City of Orlando if it was not for the associations that
were  supporting  me  to  be  here.  So  that  is  a  major  issue  that  this
committee  and  Congress  in  general  I  hope  will  take  into  consider-
ation  that  you  have  to  find  a  means  to  be  able  to  get  local  and
State participation, and the means is through the associations and
through  supporting  groups  like  ours  that  bring  associations  to-
gether.

Mr. HALL. And the means are green, aren’t they?
Ms. WARD. Yes, sir.
Mr.  HALL.  And  that  is  what,  where  we  are  supposed  to  come  in.
Ms. WARD. Yes, sir.
Mr. HALL. Mr. Oxford, if I have a minute or so left, do you want

to add to that?

Mr. OXFORD. Yes, sir. First of all, I want to point out that when
we stood up in my office, we acknowledged the need to have an ag-
gressive dialogue at the State and local level. I have an office direc-
tor for State and local affairs that reports directly to me. Since that
first  day  we  have  had  an  aggressive  outreach  through  a  series  of
workshops  at  the  State  and  local  level.  Just  a  month  ago  we  had
a  series  of  telephone  conferences  that  engaged  34  separate  states,
about  150  people,  starting  with  homeland  security  advisors  on
down,  to  talk  to  them  about  the  threat,  about  their  problem,  the
things  they  could  bring  to  this  table.  In  concert  with  that  we  have
done  specific  commercial  off-the-shelf  testing  for  State  and  local
people  that  are  interested  in  acquiring  radiation  detection  equip-
ment. We then post those results on the first responder knowledge
base,  so  they  all  have  access  to  the  test  results  so  they  can  make
these acquisitions in an informed way.

As they acquire this equipment we also have established a train-
ing program where we write the curricula for how to use these de-
vices. Using grants and training funding then, we are allowing de-
livery  at  the  State  and  local  level  to  the  people  using  the  equip-
ment  so  they  know  how  to  do  that.  In  a  like  manner  we  have  set
up  a  series  of  pilot  programs  in  the  Southeast,  and  in  the  North-
east we have established regional technical support laboratories so
if  they  have  an  alarm,  they  have  someone  they  can  call  to  get  the
alarm resolved. They can also call my joint analysis center directly
to  understand  what  to  do  with  the  alarm  information  that  they
have.

So we have had an aggressive program. I have a director for op-
erations who is a senior FBI agent. He is working now with all the
JTTFs as well as all the fusion centers that are evolving across the
country  to  bring  out  relevance  to  each  of  those  states.  So  we  can

talk a lot more in detail later, but we have had an aggressive State
and local outreach.

Mr. HALL. Well, I thank you for that information. It is a wonder-
ful thing, and I have noticed so many times at the local level that,
for  example,  a  lot  of  times  you  don’t  even  fix  a  bad  bridge  until  a
teenager gets killed there, and then that brings it to your attention
and  why  haven’t  you  done  it  before,  and  when  did  you  know  the
bridge  was  bad?  We  are  going  through  that  with  the  hospital  out
here  about  100  miles  from  here,  right  today,  at  the  federal  level.
Information is really great, and you all have a major job of making
that information, sifting it down to the local levels where they can
use  it  and  have  it  available  if  it  is  there,  and  I  thank  you  for  it.
I yield back, sir.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Hall.  Pardon  me.  I
want  to  apologize  first  to  the  three  other  witnesses.  I  intend  to
bring  you  in  right  now,  well,  in  a  moment,  to  address  the  risk  as-
sessment  issues,  which  the  Under  Secretary  talked  about  during
my  first  round  of  questions.  But  before  I  do  that,  Mr.  Oxford,  I
heard  the  Under  Secretary  refer  to  you  as  Dr.  Oxford.  And  if  we,
if  this  subcommittee  has  deprived  you  of  a  Ph.D.,  I  deeply  apolo-
gize, and let me just refer to you as Director Oxford.

And  the  question  I  have  for  you  is  that  in  your  testimony  you
have  referred  to  a  research  agenda  that  is  at  least  in  part  driven
by end user requirements. However, specifically with respect to the
Securing  the  Cities  Initiative,  there  have  been  publicized  reports,
The  New  York  Times,  among  others,  that  DNDO  is  not  addressing
the  cost  and  maintenance  and  other  requirements  of  local  govern-
ments  who  ultimately  will  be  responsible  for  paying  for  the  equip-
ment,  its  operations,  and  maintenance.  Is  there  a  formal  structure
for  the  ultimate  end  users  to  have  their  say  in  the  technologies
that  you  are  not  only  developing  but  apparently  deploying  in  the
Securing the Cities Initiative?

Mr.  OXFORD.  Well,  thank  you  for  both  those  questions,  and  with
the absence of the Ranking Member I will say that I am Mr. or Di-
rector, and I work for a living so I never went on to the other aca-
demic pursuits. But I take those as accolades.

We have a very aggressive program with the New York City offi-
cials. This is a developer, user combination. My counterpart in New
York  is  the  deputy  commissioner  for  counter  terrorism  as  des-
ignated  by  the  actual  police  commissioner  in  New  York.  Mayor
Bloomberg has delegated the radiation detection issue to Ray Kelly,
the  police  commissioner.  He,  in  turn,  has  delegated  this  to  his
counter terrorism deputy commissioner. He has formulated a struc-
ture within the New York region of bringing together all the major
entities  that  exist  within  New  York  City  as  well  as  New  York
State,  New  Jersey,  and  Connecticut  at  this  point  in  time.  They
have  veto  authority  on  any  potential  deployments  that  we  have  to
that region. This is an active dialogue where we are building a de-
ployment  architecture  that  will  be  predicated  on  system  capability
as  well  as  their  ability  to  actually  operationally  respond  to  any
alarms. We can’t just have detectors in place that have alarms that
they do not have the operational capacity to respond to.

So  it  is  a  strong,  mutual  dialogue.  Them  having  veto  authority
over  any  potential  deployments  that  we  might  make,  as  well  as

they  will  observe  any  testing  that  we  do  on  the  systems  to  make
sure  they  work  in  the  capacity  of  how  they  want  them  to  work
within the city before we deploy.

Chairman WU. Well, Director Oxford, the veto authority is great,
but one hopes develop the technology that everyone can use rather
than having a veto so that it is not deployed.

As  we  turn  to  the  other  three  witnesses,  you  know,  I  am  going
to  cite  a  few  numbers  here,  and  we  did  this  quickly,  and  this  is,
I  only  gave  the  staff  a  few  hours  to  pull  this  together,  and  this  is
down  and  dirty.  As  the  speaker  said  in  the  meeting  last  night,  in
her time on the Intel Committee, the plural of anecdote is not data,
but  this  is  slightly  better  than  anecdote  and  not  as  thorough  as  a
real risk assessment.

According to the numbers that we pulled together, computer con-
sulting  firms  estimated  that  total  economic  loss  of  all  forms  from
cyber  attack  in  2003,  was  $226  billion.  That,  I  will  skip  a  number
of  these  other  related  statistics.  That  the  insurance  industry  esti-
mates  that  financial  losses  due  to  a  tsunami  could  be  up  to  $100
billion, that weather-related losses between 1980, and 2005, in the
United  States  alone  according  to  NOAA,  is  over  $500  billion,  and
I will skip the numbers pertaining to deaths from explosives as op-
posed to other causes in human-caused incidents.

But I am deeply concerned about the proper integration of formal
risk  analysis  and  we  understand  that  there  are  some  challenges
there with good solid risk analysis. But I would like our, if you will,
outside  witnesses  to  talk  with  me  a  little  bit  about  this  and  how
we  could  better  integrate  the  risks  that  we  face  with  the  research
that  we  are  doing  so  that  we  properly  face  the  threats  of  the  fu-
ture.

Dr. EPSTEIN. Any of us just jump in?
Chairman WU. Why don’t we start with you, Dr. Epstein.
Dr.  EPSTEIN.  You  have  got  your  finger  on  a  terribly  important
problem,  and  it  is  a  terribly  hard  one.  Let  me  back  up  a  little  bit.
Much of the methodology we have to make this kind of calculation
today comes from looking at engineered systems. We have a whole
science of nuclear reactor accidents, probability of risk assessment.
What is the probability this valve will fail, this pipe will burst? An-
other  branch  that  we  are  drawing  from  is  sort  of  looking  at  infec-
tious disease, natural-occurring incidents, weather, things were we
have a database, things where we have statistics, things where na-
ture  isn’t  going  to  change  what  it  does  because  we  do  something.
We  have  got  a  very  different  problem  here  looking  at  the  inten-
tional threat. We have got adversaries that are looking not only at
what  we  are  doing  in  and  where  we  are  weak.  They  may  look  at
the  output  of  our  risk  assessment,  which  says  we  think  risk  A  is
high,  we  think  risk  B  is  low,  and  they  may  hit  us  on  risk  B.  So
in  principle  this  is  a  much  more  difficult  job  than  anything  that
has  looked  like  risk  assessment  or  probabilistic  analysis  before.
And  my  comments  on  the  field  are  not  so  much  that  I  think  there
is  a  lot  of  things  we  need  to  do  to  figure  out  how  to  handle  the
problem. It may be cautionary that it is a terribly important ques-
tion,  and  there  may  be  fundamental  limits  on  what  analysis  will
tell us.

So the type of approach I like to see is structures that help guide
our thinking. We will never know what the right number is for the
probability  of  a  terrorist  attack,  let  us  say,  but  we  have  to  have  a
system  where  if  I  think  it  is  high,  I  jack  it  up.  If  I  think  it  is  low,
I jack it down, and I get to see what happens on other parts of my
portfolio.  I  do  think  we  have  the  right  institutions  involved.  If  the
National  Academy  of  Sciences  is  gearing  up  to  look  at  what  is  the
state of science in this field, they have the ability to tap those peo-
ple  in  the  academic  community.  The  Homeland  Security  Institute
that  Under  Secretary  Cohen  mentioned  was  created  by,  suggested
by  act  of  Congress,  created  by  DHS,  with  these  specific  types  of
questions in mind. If that power can be devoted to looking at these
questions, then we have got the right analytic skills and the ability
to draw on the people, who, if there is an answer there, one would
hope they are able to come to it.

But my basic point is this is a very different question than what
we  have  been  trying  to  do  in  the  past  when  we  have  been  doing
things that sound similar.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Epstein.  For  the  next  two  wit-
nesses,  my  apologizes  to  the  panel  in  general.  Those  bells  and
whistles that you all have been hearing, I mean, it could be worse.
The  ship  could  be  sinking,  but  we  have  just  been  called  to  a  vote.
That  was  a  few  minutes  ago.  We  have  about  five  minutes  left  for
the  vote.  So  if  you  all  could  try  to  make  your  comments  in  about
a  minute  or  so  that  would  be  deeply  appreciated.  Mr.  Czerwinski.
Mr. CZERWINSKI. I will be brief. Let me just try and reframe the
issue  in  this  way.  Risk  is  different  in  homeland  security  than  it  is
in anywhere else. The reason for that is that what is at risk is just
about  everything.  If  you  think  about  what  the  DOD  has  or  what
the  Defense  Department  has  to  worry  about  in  terms  of  pursuing
its objectives, it worries about its own combatants, it worries about
non-combatants,  and  it  worries  about  the  enemy.  Well,  in  home-
land  security  we  are  worried  about  everything  else.  The  global
economy  is  a  part  of  the  equation,  so  we  have  to  look  at  this  in
such a way where we can’t just say, well, the risk is this. We have
got  vulnerabilities,  and  we  have  got  threats  against  those,  so  now
we  have  risks.  Instead,  we  have  to  take  a  look  at  much,  much
broader picture, at the impact of the certain A, B, or C level types
of vulnerabilities that Dr. Epstein was talking about and say what
would  the  consequences  on  these.  That  is  really  where  risk  comes
out.

The impact of certain attacks is one thing but also the impact of
the  measures  we  use  against  those  attacks.  An  overreaction  in
homeland  security  by  the  U.S.  Government  could  be  even  worse
than the actual attack itself, and we have seen this in the past.

What  IBM  has  been  doing  now  for  a  few  years  is  actually  mod-
eling and simulation exercises that show what these sort of impacts
might  be,  actions  and  the  impact  of  those  as  well  in  certain  cases
of  pandemics,  but  now  we  are  looking  at  one  in  terms  of  global
trade and travel flows as well.

So  we  can  go  into  this  at  another  time,  but  I  would  just  suggest

broadening the picture in that way. Thank you.

Chairman WU. Thank you.

Ms.  WARD.  This  is  an  interesting  question  for  someone  who  rep-
resents  first  responders.  We  respond  as  things  happen,  imme-
diately.  Risk  assessment  comes  through  different  groups  like  in
Florida.  I  was  on  the  Regional  Domestic  Security  Task  Force,
where  we  brought  in  different  entities  and  different  agencies  to
talk  with  us  about  how  our  ports,  I  found  this  discussion  today
quite  interesting  because  those  are  some  of  the  same  things  that
we were dealing with on the local level.

Our  first  responders  are  reactionary.  We  have  to  wait  until  the
phone rings basically telling us to go to a 911 call. We have to look
at our crime stats or our fire stats to do fire prevention. So we are
not in the same role as some of my co-panelists. But I will tell you
that  in  our  work  with  these  other  entities,  one  of  the  number  one
priorities for us is that we can talk to them.

So  I  will  come  back  to  the  inter-operability  discussion  and  just
kind  of  wind  up  by  hoping  that  this  committee  will  look  at  the
value  of  the  first  responders.  They  are  the  first  ones  on  the  scene,
long  before  any  assistance  comes  from  the  State  or  federal  level,
and these are the people that we need to take care of. And our in-
terest  in  inter-operability  is  taking  care  of  them  so  that  they  will
be  able  to  talk  to  each  other  and  ask  for  help  when  they  need  it.
So we would ask that you look at our groups, look at our associa-
tions,  and  look  to  supporting  our  programs  that  allow  us  to  have
input into the federal level.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you  very  much,  Ms.  Ward.  Thank  you  for
your  work.  Thank  you  all  for  your  fine  work.  We  look,  this  com-
mittee  looks  forward  to  working  together  with  all  of  you  over  time
to  improve  the  processes  at  which  we  can  best  identify  threats  to
our  nation  and  to  ameliorate  them  as  best  as  possible.  Perhaps
there were those, Mr. Czerwinski, you hit on the point that our na-
tional  defense  is  focused  on  one  set  of  issues,  whereas  homeland
defense is focused on so many more. Perhaps there were those who
predicted  or  at  least  said  it  was  possible  for  a  Japanese  military
strike  at  Pearl  Harbor  in  1941.  Maybe  yes,  maybe  no.  I  haven’t
looked  at  the  history  closely  enough  to  know  that.  I  know  that
through  all  the  time  that  I  was  growing  up  this  nation  was  pre-
paring for another bolt out of the blue, and we were probably look-
ing the wrong direction, except for perhaps just a few people when
the  bolt  out  of  the  blue  finally  came.  It  is  our  job  to  try  to  do  our
best,  do  our  level  best  to  have  the  technology  and  the  people  in
place  to  prevent  that  from  happening,  to  do  what  we  need  to  do.
I want to thank all the witnesses for being here today, and I now
need  to  bring  this  hearing  to  a  close.  I  want  to  thank  all  the  wit-
nesses for testifying. It has been highly educational. I look forward
to  working  with  the  agencies  and  working  with  our  outside  infor-
mation sources.

If there is no objection, the record will remain open for additional
statements.  Hearing  none,  so  ordered.  Members,  questions  will  be
submitted and answers may be given for the record. Without objec-
tion, so ordered. This hearing is now closed.

[Whereupon, at 11:49 a.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Jay M. Cohen, Under Secretary of Science and Technology, Department

of Homeland Security

Questions submitted by Chairman David Wu

Staff
Q1. In your written testimony, you stated that you have hired 66 percent of your full

staff.

Q1a. In which divisions or offices do you lack staff? Do you have adequate mid-level
employees to support your Directorate’s day-to-day activities? What impact does
this have on operations and how will things change when you are fully staffed?
What percentage of your current staff are detailed from other federal agencies?
Of those detailees, how many are in senior level positions?

Q1b. In which divisions or offices do you lack staff?
A1a,b. Program  manager  and  program  execution  functions  across  the  S&T  Direc-
torate  are  not  fully  staffed  by  federal  employees;  however,  they  are  better  staffed
now than prior to the ramping up of S&T Directorate hiring efforts at my direction.
The bulk of our hiring actions are focused on bringing on program management ex-
pertise and building the next generation of senior program managers.
Q1c. Do you have adequate mid-level employees to support your Directorate’s day-to-

day activities?

A1c. The  S&T  Directorate  supports  its  day-to-day  activities  by  supplementing  its
federal  staff  with  contractual  support  and  some  detailees  from  other  federal  agen-
cies  and  other  entities,  e.g.,  national  laboratories  and  State  and  local  governments.
The  S&T  Directorate’s  goal  is  to  further  solidify  this  staff  by  increasing  the  ratio
of federal employees to contractual staff.
Q1d. What  impact  does  this  have  on  operations  and  how  will  things  change  when

you are fully staffed?

A1d. As the S&T Directorate builds its federal staff, it will create more permanency
and build morale, leading to retention of valuable employees and institutional mem-
ory, which helps to maintain consistency and improve efficiency.
Q1e. What  percentage  of  your  current  staff  are  detailed  from  other  federal  agencies?
A1e. As  of  pay  period  three,  the  S&T  Directorate  had  262  FTE.  The  detailed  staff
equates to six percent (a total of 17 employees).
Q1f. Of those detailees, how many are in senior level positions?
A1f. One detail employee is in a senior position.

MANPADS
Q2. The  request  for  the  explosives  account  is  reduced  significantly  in  the  FY  2008
budget, due to the end of funding for the counter-MANPADS program. However,
there  have  been  a  number  of  news  reports  about  airlines  being  uninterested  in
purchasing  counter-MANPADS  technology  because  of  its  purchase  price  and
high maintenance costs.
Why  is  R&D  for  counter-MANPADs  technology  being  discontinued  before  it  can
be manufactured and maintained for an acceptable cost to end users? What are
the lessons learned from this program and has the S&T Directorate changed its
technology development programs as a result?

A2. As directed by Congress, the objectives of the program’s final phase, Phase III,
include establishing a better basis for estimating the sustainability costs for systems
derived  from  military  technology.  To  go  further  and  achieve  manufacturing,  main-
tainability,  and  sustainability  costs  acceptable  to  end  users  would  require  substan-
tial  investment  across  multiple  years,  which  is  beyond  the  scope  of  the  S&T  Direc-
torate program as defined by the Congress.

Congress  directed  DHS  to  develop  and  demonstrate  military  Counter-MANPADS
technology for protecting commercial aircraft, which the program has accomplished.
Counter-MANPADS  has  been  a  very  successful  program  resulting  in  two  systems
that  could  protect  commercial  airlines  if  deployed.  This  program  employed  a  rig-
orous  systems  engineering  approach  using  knowledge-based  acquisition  principles.

Among the important lessons learned are: a comprehensive test and evaluation pro-
gram  must  fully  account  for  the  operational  environment;  that  life-cycle  costs  must
be  addressed  early  and  completely;  that  modeling  and  simulation  produce  substan-
tial  dividends;  and  engaging  all  stakeholders  early  and  often  is  crucial  to  success.
This has proven to be an excellent model for major systems development programs,
which  the  S&T  Directorate  would  follow  for  similar  programs  that  are  meant  to  be
carried all the way to a deployment decision. Many S&T Directorate programs feed
into  broad  pilot  programs  managed  by  the  Transportation  Security  Administration
(TSA),  which  would  carry  the  technology  to  deployment  for  use  by  TSA  agents  and
first  responders.  In  such  cases,  the  S&T  Directorate  would  develop  the  technology
to a level appropriate for use in pilot deployment projects.

The  developmental  phases  of  the  Counter-MANPADS  program  will  end  in  early
2009, with Phase III in-service operational suitability evaluations in cargo and pas-
senger airline environments.

MSIs
Q3. You  mentioned  in  your  testimony  that  some  funding  for  the  University  Centers
of Excellence and scholarship and fellowship programs will go towards increas-
ing the participation of under-represented minorities and minority-serving insti-
tutions (MSIs) in these programs.

Q3a. What  is  the  current  level  of  participation  by  under-represented  students  (in-
cluding  women  and  minorities)  and  MSIs?  What  are  your  specific  plans  for
outreach  to  and  retention  of  these  groups  in  the  S&T  Directorate’s  education
programs?

A3a. Currently there are 255 students participating in the Scholarship and Fellow-
ship Program at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Of that number 44 percent
or  115  are  women  and  39  students  identified  themselves  as  under-represented  mi-
norities.  Please  note  that  providing  information  on  race  and  ethnicity  is  voluntary,
therefore not all minority students may have been identified. Since the inception of
the  Program  in  2003,  scholarships  and  fellowships  have  been  awarded  to  17  stu-
dents  from  13  Minority  Serving  Institutions  (MSIs):  11  students  from  Historically
Black  Colleges  and  Universities  (HBCUs)  and  six  students  from  Hispanic  Serving
Institutions (HSIs).
Q3b. What  are  your  specific  plans  for  outreach  to  and  retention  of  these  groups  in

the S&T Directorate’s education programs?

A3b. In FY 2007, the S&T Directorate established the Minority Serving Institutions
(MSI)  program  to  enhance  outreach,  recruiting  and  retention.  The  MSI  initiatives
are designed to improve the capabilities of MSIs to conduct research in areas critical
to  homeland  security,  develop  a  new  generation  of  scientists  capable  of  advancing
homeland security goals and aid in faculty retention in the broad area of homeland
security science, technology, engineering and mathematics (HS–STEM). Competitive
incentives  will  be  used  to  integrate  the  MSIs  with  the  DHS  University  Centers  of
Excellence,  to  develop  homeland  security  research  and  training  capabilities  at  the
MSIs,  and  to  develop  career  pathways  for  MSI  HS–STEM  students  at  DHS,  State
and local agencies, national laboratories and Centers of Excellence. Finally, the pro-
gram  will  develop  internship  and  career  opportunities  at  a  variety  of  DHS  venues.

Program activities include:

• Conducting  a  Summer  Research  Team  (SRT)  Program  for  MSI  that  provides
a  10–12  week  summer  research  experience  for  teams,  consisting  of  a  faculty
member  and  up  to  two  students,  to  perform  research  at  a  DHS  University
Center  or  Excellence  (COE)  that  aligns  with  the  DHS  mission.  The  program
began in 2005 and to date there have been 16 teams and 43 faculty and stu-
dents  from  15  MSIs  who  have  participated  in  the  program.  Several  of  these

• Establishing  DHS  HS–STEM  Leadership  and  Career  Development  Grants  to
MSIs  to  support  programs  in  critical  HS–STEM  areas.  These  programs  pro-
vide  MSIs  with  funds  to  support  early  career  faculty  to  establish  or  expand
education,  research  and  training  activities  in  HS–STEM  areas.  The  faculty
awards  are  closely  linked  to  scholarship  and  fellowship  awards  to  qualified
undergraduate  and  graduate  students  in  related  homeland  security  STEM
disciplines who intend to pursue homeland security professional and scientific
careers.

The  S&T  Directorate  conducted  further  outreach  efforts  in  2007.  University  Pro-
grams hosted three regional MSI workshops, which took place on February 4 in Bal-
timore targeting Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), on February
21 at Broward Community College (Florida) targeting Hispanic Serving Institutions
(HSIs),  HBCUs  and  MSI  community  colleges,  and  on  February  28  at  USC  (Cali-
fornia) targeting HSIs and Tribal Colleges. At these workshops, DHS:

• Introduced the MSIs to four new solicitations for Centers of Excellence (COE),
explained the opportunities those represent and encouraged the MSIs to sub-
mit proposals as lead institutions and as partners;
• Explained  the  ideas  and  expectations  for  the  new  MSI  program  that  U/S
Cohen  initiated,  and  solicit  the  MSIs  input.  Note:  UP  revamped  the  MSI
Leadership and Career Development Grant program significantly in response
to comments received from MSIs at these workshops;
• Described  the  2007  Summer  Research  Team  program  and  opportunities  for
• Described  DHS  Scholarship  and  Fellowship  Programs  and  the  DHS
• Invited  the  MSIs  to  a  ten-day  summer  workshop  on  teaching  terrorism

In  addition,  the  Department  wants  to  enhance  the  role  of  MSIs  within  the  COEs
by  increasing  both  the  number  and  extent  of  institutional  partnerships  between
MSIs and the COEs; either through new COEs, for which MSIs could be lead insti-
tutions,  or  by  expanding  the  network  at  existing  COEs.  The  current  COEs  have  a
total of 15 MSI partners.

Human-Technology Interface
Q4. The  newly  created  Human  Factors  division  within  the  S&T  Directorate  could
potentially save DHS millions of dollars by providing ‘‘Human-Technology Inter-
face’’  testing  services  that  could  help  determine  whether  technology  was  easy  to
use and socially acceptable.
What are your plans for leveraging this capability?

A4. The creation of the Human Factors Division within the S&T Directorate reflects
the  leadership’s  recognition  that  integrating  human  factors  elements  early  in  the
Research  and  Development  (R&D)  process  can  increase  the  effectiveness  of  tech-

nologies and decrease long-term costs. Utilizing the capital available in the Human
Factors Division, the S&T Directorate is working to embed human systems elements
into  all  phases  of  the  R&D  process,  from  the  basic  and  applied  research  stages  to
the  formulation  of  acquisition  guidance.  We  are  also  working  to  leverage  the  re-
sources of our partners at the Department of Defense, NASA, the FAA, and the na-
tional  labs—including  the  work  being  done  at  the  Transportation  Security  Lab—to
inform and enhance this work.

The  S&T  Directorate  also  includes  human-technology  interface  as  a  key  compo-
nent  in  the  qualification  and  certification  of  security  screening  and  detection  tech-
nologies.  For  example,  extensive  human-technology  interface  assessment  of  hand-
held  metal  detectors  was  conducted  prior  to  their  qualification  and  procurement  by
the  Transportation  Security  Administration  (TSA).  Further,  recognizing  that  incor-
porating human factors elements into each system it deploys is critical, the S&T Di-
rectorate  is  formalizing,  through  the  establishment  of  a  Community  Acceptance  of
Technologies Panel, the already routine interface DHS programs have with first re-
sponders and the American public.

Transportation Security Lab
Q5. I understand that the Transportation Security Lab (TSL) would like to offer its

testing and evaluation services to private entities for a fee.
What  is  your  opinion  of  this  idea?  Why  should  the  Federal  Government  offer
these types of testing and evaluation services instead of the private sector?

A5. The  S&T  Directorate  is  open  to  the  concept  where  DHS  Laboratories,  such  as
the  Transportation  Security  Lab  (TSL),  would  perform  testing  and  evaluation  serv-
ices  for  a  fee  and  on  a  confidential  basis.  It  is  important  that  our  unique  facilities
and  testing  expertise  be  made  available  to  commercial  industry  and  others  for  the
impartial  testing  of  technologies  being  deployed  at  the  Nation’s  airports  to  screen
baggage.  Currently,  TSL  and  other  DHS  labs  bear  the  entire  costs  of  performing
services that benefit baggage inspection equipment manufacturers. By adopting user
fees,  we  are  not  seeking  to  compete  with  private  industry  in  any  way.  Rather,  we
are  seeking  to  offer  industry  the  use  of  the  unique  DHS  facilities  and  skilled  per-
sonnel on a not-to-interfere basis.

Questions submitted by Representative Phil Gingrey

Projects
Q1. The  S&T  Directorate  actively  pursues  high-risk,  high-yield  research  and  devel-
opment  activities  through  the  Office  of  Innovation,  with  the  explicit  expectation
that many of these projects will fail.
How will the Directorate choose projects to pursue in this office? What processes
are  in  place  to  ensure  that  projects  that  are  not  coming  to  fruition  are  in  fact
terminated?

A1. The Director of Innovation/HSARPA works closely with the Under Secretary for
Science  and  Technology,  the  Division  Directors,  other  Portfolio  Directors,  industry,
academia,  other  government  organizations,  and  other  sources  to  determine  topic
areas for projects. The Director utilizes many sources for guidance including:

• DHS  Goals  and  Priorities  as  described  by  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Secu-

rity;

• Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB)  and  Office  of  Science  and  Tech-
nology  Policy  (OSTP)  Research  and  Development  Budget  Priority  Guidance;

• Goals set by the Under Secretary for Science and Technology;
• Congressional Direction; and
• Our  Customers,  the  agencies  and  agents  that  are  on  the  front  lines  of  DHS
law  enforcement  and  protection  services.  Through  the  IPT  process  they  are
already providing us with their list of needs. If we believe there is a potential
solution  that  may  be  high  risk  but  would  revolutionize  the  way  the  need  is
met,  either  by  greatly  increasing  performance  and  capability  or  by  reducing
the procurement and maintenance costs, we may decide to select that project
for accelerated prototyping.

• Our  Vendors,  we  have  received  some  very  innovative  ideas  from  industry,
from  DHS  labs  and  national  labs  in  the  war  on  terrorism.  If  these  ideas  are

94

such that they would provide leap ahead capabilities if successful, we consider
them for Office of Innovation execution.

All  the  projects  that  are  executed  under  the  Office  of  Innovation  will  have  pro-
gram  plans  and  schedules  developed  that  include  milestone  events,  and  exit  ramps
if  the  technologies  do  not  appear  to  be  progressing.  The  S&T  Directorate  will  hold
periodic reviews for all programs, including innovation, and the decision to continue
a  program  or  terminate  will  come  from  the  senior  staff  involved  in  those  reviews.

Coordination Activities
Q2. Your  testimony  identified  ways  in  which  the  S&T  Directorate  coordinates  with
other  agencies  and  groups  throughout  the  Federal  Government.  Similarly,  Mr.
Oxford  identified  coordination  activities  undertaken  at  DNDO  in  his  testimony.
However,  neither  of  your  statements  mentions  coordination  activities  between
DNDO and the S&T Directorate.
Do  you  consult  with  DNDO  for  strategic  planning  and  budgeting  purposes?
What mechanisms exist within the Department of Homeland Security to coordi-
nate and balance the activities of the S&T Directorate and DNDO?

A2. S&T  and  DNDO  continue  to  have  a  close  relationship  within  the  Department
and  do  coordinate  efforts  at  all  levels  from  the  shared  use  of  the  radiological  and
nuclear expertise at the Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML) to the in-
tegration of requirements and system development of technologies for use in Depart-
mental  initiatives  such  as  Secure  Freight.  The  overarching  missions  of  the  two
agencies  are  clearly  delineated  and  therefore  do  not  require  a  formal  collaboration
during  strategic  planning  and  budgeting  activities  there  are  multiple  working  level
interactions  that  incorporate  requirements  and  de-conflict  overlapping  and  collo-
cated  sensor  and  architecture  development  programs.  DNDO  was  also  invited  to
participate  in  the  S&T  IPT  process  to  provide  them  out-year  program  insight  and
a sense of Departmental priorities in the R&D arena.

Improving Methodologies
Q3. Dr.  Epstein  suggests  that  improving  methodologies  for  determining  which
threats  to  address  and  how  much  to  spend  on  each  should  be  a  high  priority
for the government.
What  activities  do  you  have  in  your  organization  to  address  the  need  for  deci-
sion-support and long-term strategic planning? What interagency efforts are un-
derway to plan across disciplines and threats?

A3. The  foundation  for  the  S&T  Directorate’s  overall  decision-support  approach  is
the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process, which initi-
ates  and  monitors  S&T  Directorate  programs  and  ensures  that  these  programs  re-
sult  in  a  focused  effort  to  improve  homeland  security  through  science  and  tech-
nology. The S&T Directorate’s PPBE process uses risk-informed assessment tools to
inform  the  development  of  program  priorities,  and  to  focus  efforts  on  addressing
high-consequence threats. The Homeland Security Institute (HSI) has developed an
independent  model  to  assess  the  potential  for  S&T  Directorate  programs  to  reduce
homeland  security  risk  and  this  model  has  been  used  to  evaluate  programs  based
on an adjustable set of criteria which can inform the S&T Directorate’s PPBE proc-
ess. This model estimates S&T Directorate program contributions to existing home-
land  security  capability  gaps  while  weighing  the  homeland  security  risk  reduction
value of the programs.

The S&T Directorate is committed to delivering capabilities that DHS components
can rely on to meet their operational needs. To accomplish this, the S&T Directorate
facilitated Customer-led Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) to identify homeland secu-
rity capability requirements across the Department. Approximately half of the S&T
budget  was  dedicated  to  developing  products  identified  by  DHS  customer-led  IPTs
that established capability gaps and requirements to drive and inform the research
and  development  (R&D)  efforts  of  the  S&T  Directorate.  These  gaps  will  enable  the
S&T  Directorate  to  identify  key  customer-oriented  programs.  In  meeting  these  cus-
tomer  capability  requirements,  the  S&T  Directorate  draws  on  the  best  technologies
and  technology  researchers  and  developers  from  across  the  homeland  security  re-
search  enterprise  ranging  from  the  private  sector  to  other  government  agencies,  to
universities,  to  international  allies.  The  S&T  Directorate  has  already  put  in  place
numerous interagency Memoranda of Understanding to ensure efficient coordination
between  the  S&T  Directorate  and  other  federal,  State  and  local  agencies;  and  the
S&T Directorate has Divisions dedicated to Interagency and International collabora-

tion. In executing its balanced portfolio of investments (from basic research to tech-
nology  transition),  the  S&T  Directorate  is  determined  to  be  the  model  customer-fo-
cused, output-oriented, full-service science and technology organization that delivers
significant value and supports and enhances DHS mission success.

Questions submitted by Representative Judy Biggert

Protective Measures
Q1a. How  is  DHS  implementing  its  responsibility  to  analyze  critical  national  infra-

structure vulnerabilities and to implement protective measures?

A1a. The Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate provides analysis of critical in-
frastructure vulnerabilities and supports the implementation of protective measures
through its Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Modeling, Simulation and Anal-
ysis  (MSA)  program.  Activities  carried  out  through  this  program  include  risk-in-
formed  prioritization  of  strategies  and  resource  allocations  in  support  of  the  Na-
tional Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructure and Key Assets.
For  example,  one  project  within  the  program,  the  Critical  Infrastructure  Decision
Support System (CIPDSS), provides risk informed insights for making critical infra-
structure protection decisions by considering all 17 critical Infrastructures and their
primary  interdependencies.  Once  fully  developed,  the  CIPDSS  will  assist  decision-
makers  in  making  informed  choices  by  computing  human  health  and  safety,  eco-
nomic,  public  confidence,  national  security,  and  environmental  impacts.  The
CIPDSS  will  transition  to  the  DHS’s  National  Infrastructure  Simulation  and  Anal-
ysis Center (NISAC) for operational use in FY 2008.
Q1b. Why has DHS chosen to fund certain of its infrastructure risk assessment and
analysis  research  at  the  national  laboratories  on  a  year-to-year  basis  rather
than a ‘‘line-item’’ budget basis?

A1b. We  have  recently  realigned  the  S&T  Directorate’s  budget  to  match  the  S&T
Directorate  organization  and  to  map  S&T  Directorate  programs  more  directly  with
the  components  and  missions  within  DHS.  This  provides  our  customers  and  con-
gress with more transparency to our budget and activities. The incorporation of risk
assessments and the analysis of critical infrastructure sectors into S&T Directorate
programs require a holistic program approach, which relies on understanding exist-
ing,  emerging  and  perceived  threats.  A  line  item  for  risk  assessments  would  not
align those activities with the programs they support.
Q1c. What  is  the  division  of  labor  among  the  various  laboratory  programs  in  this

effort?

A1c. Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL),
and  Sandia  National  Laboratories  (SNL)  all  participate  in  CIPDSS’s  development.
Tasks  related  to  program  coordination,  development  of  system  architecture  and
tools,  and  prototyping  and  deployment  will  be  performed  by  all  of  the  laboratories.
Tasks  related  to  consequence  model  development  will  be  emphasized  at  LANL  and
SNL. Decision model development will be emphasized at ANL.
Q1d. How do you distinguish one lab’s function and capabilities from another’s?
A1d. The  S&T  Directorate,  through  collaborative  interactions,  works  with  the  na-
tional laboratories to identify which laboratories have the functions and capabilities
that  are  most  suitable  for  specific  programs/projects  carried  out  by  the  S&T  Direc-
torate.
Q1e. What  provisions  has  DHS  made  for  communications  connectivity  and  shared

access to common databases among the laboratories?

A1e. The S&T Directorate arranges communications connectivity and shared access
to  common  databases  among  the  laboratories  based  on  program/project  needs.  One
example  is  the  CIPDSS  program,  in  which  participants  communicate  regularly  and
share data, models, and results through multiple mechanisms. This includes weekly
conference calls that include all three participating national labs and quarterly face-
to-face meetings that include most technical members. Tri-lab team members share
data through the Knowledge Management (KM) portal hosted at SNL. Papers, tech-
nical  communications,  and  working  papers  are  shared  through  the  KM  portal.  Sys-
tem models are shared through web-based Concurrent Version Systems repositories.
Lastly,  data  resulting  from  computer  simulation  runs  are  automatically  shared
across the tri-lab team using automatic database synchronization mechanisms.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Vayl  S.  Oxford,  Director,  Domestic  Nuclear  Detection  Office,  Depart-

ment of Homeland Security

Questions submitted by Chairman David Wu

Detailees
Q1. You  mentioned  in  your  written  testimony  that  you  have  detailees  on  staff  from

other federal agencies, including the Departments of Energy and Defense.
What  percentage  of  your  staff  is  detailed  from  another  agency?  How  do  you  en-
sure  that  interagency  personnel  are  not  improperly  involved  in  making  grant
money  available  to  their  home  agencies?  For  example,  what  conflict-of-interest
rules and guidance are in place at DNDO?

A1. Currently 40 percent of DNDO staff members are detailees. Of this, 29 percent
are  interagency  detailees  from  the  Departments  of  Energy  (DOE),  Defense  (DOD)
and  Justice  (DOJ/FBI),  as  well  as  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC).
Detailees  from  the  Department  of  Defense  include  officers  and  civilians  from  the
Army, Air Force, Navy, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and the Under Secretary
of  Defense  for  Acquisition,  Technology  and  Logistics.  In  addition,  DNDO  has
detailees from other DHS Components such as the U.S. Coast Guard, Customs and
Border Protection, and the Transportation Security Administration, which make up
the remaining 11 percent of the detailee staff.

Interagency  personnel  are  subject  to  Department  of  Homeland  Security  Manage-
ment  Directive  0480.1,  Ethics/Standards  of  Conduct;  Executive  Order  12674,  Prin-
ciples of Ethical Conduct for Government Officers and Employees; and 5 C.F.R. Part
2635,  Standards  of  Ethical  Conduct  for  Employees  of  the  Executive  Branch.  The
DHS  Ethics  Office  provides  mandatory  initial  ethics  orientation  to  all  new  employ-
ees,  including  detailees,  as  well  as  mandatory  ethics  training  on  an  annual  basis.
In  addition,  detailees  are  not  allowed  to  make  funding  decisions  that  affect  their
sending organizations. DNDO’s budget and contracting offices are independent from
the program offices in which detailees reside. Furthermore, grants would not be pro-
vided to other federal agencies (the source of DNDO detailees).

Student Interest
Q2. You  pointed  out  in  your  testimony  the  serious  problem  with  decreasing  student
interest  in  the  field  of  nuclear  science,  and  I  am  pleased  to  see  that  you  are
working  with  the  National  Science  Foundation  to  provide  funding  for  students
interested in this field.
How do you plan to make sure students who take advantage of this funding op-
portunity choose to go into go into homeland security-related positions, especially
at  DNDO?  Also,  what  is  the  actual  job  market  for  people  with  these  degrees?
What  studies  or  analyses  indicate  strong  demand  for  nuclear  scientists?  How
many  graduates  in  nuclear  science  do  we  need  each  year,  and  at  what  level
(Bachelor’s, Master’s, or Ph.D.)?

A2. As stated in the testimony, the nuclear science community is forecasting a need
for approximately 100 additional new Ph.D.s per year in order to fill the overall de-
mand, which includes homeland security. Historically eight to ten percent of nuclear
scientists go into homeland security-related positions and we expect this percentage
to  remain  the  same  or  increase.  Research  and  development  for  homeland  security
is  performed  at  national  laboratories,  companies,  and  universities  by  nuclear  sci-
entists  who  have  broad  interests,  not  just  security.  Through  its  Transformational
R&D  Directorate,  DNDO  is  reaching  out  to  this  research  community  with  a  com-
bination of Broad Agency Announcements, Calls for Proposals, and National Science
Foundation  (NSF)  solicitations.  We  do  not  require  nuclear  scientists  who  receive
awards  under  the  Academic  Research  Initiative  (ARI)  to  join  DNDO,  but  we  do  ex-
pect them to join the nuclear science community, whose work contributes to DNDO’s
programs and activities.

The  job  market  in  nuclear  science  is  improving  with  opportunities  in  homeland
security, medical applications, basic research, defense, etc. An increasing number of
nuclear scientists are being sought by DOE, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC),
Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA),  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA),
DHS,  Defense  Threat  Reduction  Agency  (DTRA),  and  the  intelligence  agencies.  In
addition,  many  universities’  nuclear  engineering  departments  are  seeking  new  fac-

ulty members and department heads. The American Nuclear Society’s Special Com-
mittee on Federal Investment in Nuclear Education found ‘‘nearly uniform anecdotal
evidence that the current production rate for NSE (nuclear science and engineering)
graduates is not sufficient to meet demand.’’

In  November  2004,  the  DOE/NSF  Nuclear  Science  Advisory  Committee  rec-
ommended that the number of new Ph.D.s in nuclear science be increased by 20 per-
cent  over  the  next  five  to  10  years.  The  need  for  additional  graduates  with  Bach-
elor’s and Master’s Degrees is assumed to be in a similar, 20 percent range.

The shortage in graduates is documented in the following five publications:

Beginning  of  the  21st  Century,  DOE/NSF  Nuclear  Science  Advisory  Com-
mittee, Subcommittee on Education, November 2004.

Risk Assessment
Q3. What sort of risk assessment does DNDO use when determining where to deploy

their detection technology?
We  heard  in  the  hearing  from  you  and  Mr.  Czerwinski  that  DNDO  has  global
responsibilities;  however  it  seems  that  deployment  of  detection  technologies  is
limited to highly-visible, highly-trafficked ports of entry with relatively little at-
tention given to intercepting smuggled materials in foreign countries or detecting
materials smuggled across more remote borders. How do you decide where to di-
rect your efforts?

A3. In assessing risks, DNDO relies on its gap analysis to guide the deployment of
detection  technology  as  well  as  the  development  of  new  detection  technologies  and
new detection concepts of operation. In this analysis, DNDO has determined the ex-
isting baseline architecture of USG capabilities and organized it into a set of detec-
tion  layers  that  are  grouped  into  three  main  categories  (international,  border,  and
interior).

From this baseline architecture, DNDO looks at all possible paths from the origi-
nal  source  of  the  radiological  or  nuclear  material  or  weapon  to  a  target  within  the
U.S. Typically, DNDO will look at authorized pathways, e.g., Ports of Entry (POEs);
other  land,  air,  and  maritime  pathways;  and  unauthorized  pathways  (e.g.,  illegal
crossing  of  land  borders  in  remote  areas).  From  this  examination  of  pathways,
DNDO  identifies  gaps,  i.e.,  areas  where  detection  is  not  currently  sufficient.  For
each gap, DNDO identifies options to fill the gaps, evaluates the likely effectiveness
of  the  options,  and  makes  recommendations  for  programs  (either  deployment,  new
concepts  of  operations,  or  new  research  and  development)  to  address  the  architec-
ture gaps.

In  formulating  recommendations,  DNDO  is  guided  by  the  language  in  NSPD–43/
HSPD–14,  which  states  that  ‘‘DNDO  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of
the domestic portion of the global architecture,’’ while ‘‘the Secretaries of State, De-
fense  and  Energy  will  maintain  their  respective  responsibilities  for  policy  guidance
and  implementation  of  the  portion  of  the  global  architecture  outside  the  United
States.’’  Those  international  responsibilities  include  State’s  EXBS  programs,  Ener-
gy’s  Second  Line  of  Defense  and  Megaports  programs,  and  Defense’s  Cooperative
Threat  Reduction  activities.  This  process  has  led  DNDO  to  focus  additional  efforts
to  develop  detection  strategies  for  general  aviation  pathways,  small  maritime  path-
ways, and remote border crossings, as well as interior layer detection (e.g., Securing
the Cities).

DNDO is constantly updating its gap analysis and, to the greatest extent possible,
incorporating  risk  as  it  relates  to  the  current  threat  as  a  factor  in  its  deployment
decisions throughout all (land, air, and maritime) pathways.

Questions submitted by Representative Phil Gingrey

Funding
Q1. Your testimony submitted to the Committee describes a remarkable difference in
funding  awards  between  National  Laboratories  and  private  industry  and  aca-
demia. For instance, you cite a call for proposals to National Labs in December
2005 that awarded nearly $40 million to 44 proposals from a pool of 150, a suc-
cess  rate  of  nearly  30  percent.  Whereas,  a  similar  announcement  to  the  private
sector  and  academia  awarded  only  $3.1  million  to  seven  institutions,  out  of  a
pool of 200 submissions: a 3.5 percent success rate.
What accounts for this stark difference in funding amounts and success?

A1. DNDO would like to clarify that the 200 submissions referred to above pertain
to the informal white paper phase. The actual number of proposals received by pri-
vate  industry  and  universities  was  75.  Therefore,  the  number  that  should  be  com-
pared to the 150 proposals for the National Labs is 75 rather than 200.

It  should  be  further  noted  that  DNDO  made  the  awards  in  two  parts.  DNDO
awarded  the  first  set  of  grants  to  seven  academic  institutions,  and  the  second  set
to 10 private industry participants. Thus, a total of 17 awards worth approximately
$12  million  have  been  made,  putting  the  success  rate  at  nearly  23  percent  so  far
for this announcement.

The  differences  in  award  timing  were  due  to  differences  in  the  grants  and  con-
tracting  processes.  Regardless,  these  research  projects  were  started  as  soon  as  the
awards  could  be  made.  For  FY  2007,  awards  to  industry  and  academia  will  utilize
approximately  one-third  of  exploratory  research  funding  under  DNDO’s  Trans-
formational Research and Development Directorate. Also, it should be noted that in
addition to these projects, industry and academia have other projects and opportuni-
ties  which  are  not  included  in  the  awards  above.  These  include  opportunities  with
DNDO’s Small Business Innovative Research program and the newly initiated Aca-
demic Research Initiative.

Coordination Activities
Q2. At the hearing, you identified ways in which DNDO coordinates radiological de-
tection  research  with  other  agencies  and  groups.  Similarly,  Under  Secretary
Cohen  identified  coordination  activities  undertaken  by  the  S&T  Directorate  in
his testimony. However, neither of your statements mentions coordination activi-
ties between DNDO and the S&T Directorate.
Do  you  consult  with  the  S&T  Directorate  for  strategic  planning  and  budgeting
purposes? What mechanisms exist within the Department of Homeland Security
to  coordinate  and  balance  the  activities  of  the  S&T  Directorate  and  DNDO?
What  interagency  efforts  are  underway  to  plan  across  disciplines  and  threats?
A2. Yes.  S&T  and  DNDO  continue  to  have  a  close  relationship  within  the  Depart-
ment, coordinating efforts at all levels—from the shared use of the radiological and
nuclear expertise at the Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML) to the in-
tegration  of  requirements  and  system  development  of  technologies  being  developed
for  use  in  Departmental  initiatives  such  as  Secure  Freight.  In  addition,  there  are
multiple  working  level  interactions  that  incorporate  requirements  and  de-conflict
overlapping  and  collocated  sensor  and  architecture  development  programs.  DNDO
was  also  invited  to  participate  in  the  S&T  Integrated  Product  Team  (IPT)  process
to  provide  them  with  out-year  program  insight  and  a  sense  of  Departmental  prior-
ities  in  the  R&D  arena.  Section  502  (d)  of  the  SAFE  Port  Act  of  2006  also  requires
that  S&T  and  DNDO  develop  an  annual  report  that  speaks  to  the  coordination  be-
tween the two Components.

Threats
Q3. Dr.  Epstein  suggests  that  improving  methodologies  for  determining  which
threats  to  address  and  how  much  to  spend  on  each  should  be  a  high  priority
for the government.
What  activities  do  you  have  in  your  organization  to  address  the  need  for  deci-
sion-support and long-term strategic planning? What interagency efforts are un-
derway to plan across disciplines and threats?

A3. DNDO recognizes the need for formal systems engineering processes to support
and  document  mission,  requirements,  concepts  of  operation,  and  program  perform-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 Jun 11, 2007 Jkt 033611 PO 00000 Frm 00102 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\T&I07\030807\33611 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

ance.  These  processes  include  risk  analysis  to  prioritize  threats  and  cost-benefit
analysis to evaluate particular programs.

Currently,  DNDO  is  developing  an  end-to-end  technology  development  plan  that
starts  from  a  detection  architecture  gap  analysis  and  documents  the  process  from
the identification of options, through prototype development, operational testing, de-
ployment, and continuous evaluation. This documentation will provide decision sup-
port to the strategic planning process and will ensure the government pursues effec-
tive programs at every stage.

DNDO  Red  Teaming  and  Net  Assessments  (RTNA)  are  also  developing  an  end-
to-end  probabilistic  methodology  for  analysis  of  detection  architecture  effectiveness
that  is  grounded  in  both  adversary  capability  and  detection  node  operational  per-
formance.  Collaboration  is  occurring  with  Defense  Threat  Reduction  Agency,  ele-
ments  of  the  intelligence  community,  Department  of  Energy,  and  United  States
Coast  Guard  on  this  project.  This  methodology  will  enhance  global  situational
awareness  and  support  interagency  collaborative  planning,  course-of-action  evalua-
tions,  tabletop  exercises,  including  red  team  and  blue  team  assessments,  and  anal-
yses of battle management, exercise support, crisis action planning, and interagency
collaborative  planning.  This  will  also  be  an  effective  tool  to  support  technology  in-
vestments and related decision making. The methodology defines and measures ad-
versary  capabilities  through  intelligent  overlay  of  interagency  threat  databases,  in-
dividual  expert  analyses,  and  adversary  emulation  operations.  It  also  defines  and
measures  detection  node  performance  through  network  models  for  systems  and
CONOPS  at  individual  detection  layers  and  is  based  on  a  process  developed  for
DNDO architecture studies and risk analyses.

In addition to DNDO internal risk assessment, DNDO is actively participating in
DHS-wide  programs  such  as  the  Risk  Informed  Planning  Program  which  seeks  to
perform risk analysis across disciplines and threats to provide a comparable risk as-
sessment between DHS components. DNDO is beginning to work directly with DHS
Science  and  Technology  to  perform  a  WMD  risk  assessment  common  to  chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons.

DNDO  plays  a  key  role  in  interdisciplinary  planning.  One  of  DNDO’s  founding
principles was the allocation of responsibilities called, ‘‘centralized planning with de-
centralized  execution.’’  This  means  that  DNDO  is  responsible  for  developing  the
global  detection  architecture,  conducting  test  and  evaluation  of  available  systems
that  may  be  deployed,  and  assessing  the  effectiveness  of  the  deployed  architecture
through  red  teaming  and  other  means.  However,  it  remains  the  responsibility  of
interagency  partners  to  execute  their  respective  portions  of  the  global  architecture.
Through  centralized  planning,  DNDO  seeks  to  fully  utilize  expertise  from  imple-
menting agencies, and leverage, not duplicate, existing initiatives related to nuclear
detection. Several mechanisms facilitate collaboration between interagency partners.
For  example,  DNDO  uses  the  Interagency  Coordination  Council  (ICC)  as  a  forum
for effective coordination and, when required, as a mechanism for conflict resolution
across  all  appropriate  departments  and  agencies.  ICC  members  will  resolve  policy
issues  that  arise  across  organizational  boundaries.  In  addition,  members  will  serve
as liaisons between their respective organizations and the DNDO to ensure that the
interagency community is fully aware of each other’s activities as they relate to the
mission  of  the  DNDO.  Another  example  would  be  the  use  of  interagency  detailees
as  full-time  DNDO  staff  members.  These  detailees  play  a  critical  role  in  helping
DNDO interface with its implementing partners across the global nuclear detection
architecture. Frequent dialogue facilitated by DNDO detailees with their home orga-
nizations  results  in  a  thorough  understanding  of  implementing  agency  operations,
technological  requirements,  reporting  and  information  analysis  needs—all  of  which
drive DNDO operations.

Overview
Q4. Please  provide  to  the  Committee  an  overview  of  the  activities  DNDO  has  taken
to  include  first-responders  in  the  planning  and  operations  of  your  research  and
development activities.

A4. To periodically engage the State and local (S&L) community, DNDO formed an
S&L  Stakeholder  Working  Group  and  has  held  five  Working  Group  meetings  each
lasting  three  days.  Working  group  meetings  are  designed  specifically  to  bring  the
Nation’s  preventive  rad/nuc  detection  community  together,  inform  participants  on
activities  within  DNDO  and  the  community,  and  obtain  feedback  on  DNDO’s  pro-
grams and initiatives.

Since  its  inception,  DNDO  has  made  it  a  fundamental  priority  to  work  together
with,  and  receive  feedback  from,  its  S&L  first  responders  in  developing  programs
and products. This continual loop of information exchange has been mutually bene-

ficial to DNDO and S&L jurisdictions and has helped refine various programs/prod-
ucts/services throughout the entire life cycle of the development process:

— Securing  The  Cities  Initiative  (STC):  Under  STC,  DNDO  has  led  a  consor-
tium of S&L stakeholders in the New York City region to establish a region-
wide  coordinated  radiation  detection  and  interdiction  capability.  This  effort
includes  agencies  from  the  States  of  NY,  NJ,  and  CT.  An  overarching  STC
Working  Group  was  established  in  January  2007,  with  several  specialized
committees  including  the  Equipment  Working  Group.  Through  interactive
discussions and live technology demonstrations, this group has addressed re-
sponder operational equipment requirements in an effort to focus DNDO ac-
quisition  and  research  efforts,  and  has  agreed  upon  an  initial  set  of  equip-
ment  to  be  procured  and  distributed  to  responders  throughout  the  region.
This  group  has  also  brought  developers  of  DNDO’s  SUV-based  mobile  Ad-
vanced Spectroscopic Portal System face to face with the operators in the re-
gion  to  facilitate  the  design  process.  Additionally,  the  group  is  addressing
long-term sustainability issues such as equipment maintenance and calibra-
tion on a regional basis.

— Southeast Transportation Corridor Pilot (SETCP): Under SETCP, DNDO has
reached  out  to  nine  Southeast  States,  plus  the  District  of  Columbia,  and
identified  first  responders  with  preventive  rad/nuc  detection  responsibilities
in their respective jurisdictions. For the last year, DNDO has met with these
individuals at least quarterly and has solicited their functional requirements
through  directed  surveys,  interactive  discussions,  and  live  technology  dem-
onstrations. This group was instrumental in developing the Commercial Ve-
hicle  Inspection  annex  to  the  Preventive  Rad/Nuc  Detection  Program  Man-
agement  Handbook.  S&L  participants  also  had  input  on  the  development  of
the 
the  SUV-based  mobile  Advanced
Spectroscopic Portal System. The SETCP live technology demonstration (No-
vember 2006) was operated entirely by S&L responders.

— Radiation  Detection  Device  Testing:  DNDO  works  closely  with  a  group  of
S&L  first  responders  to  produce  test  results  that  would  be  helpful  for  S&L
jurisdictions  as  they  make  decisions  about  which  detection  equipment  to
purchase. For the Anole test series, S&L first responders reviewed the draft
report  to  ensure  its  readability  and  usefulness.  For  the  Bobcat  test  series,
CONOPS from S&L first responders were utilized to generate real-world test
scenarios.  Additionally,  S&L  first  responders  participated  in  hands-on  test-
ing of equipment.

— Display  and  Algorithm  Integrated  Product  Teams  (IPT):  The  Human  Port-
able  Radiation  Detection  System  program  staff,  and  the  Human  Factors
Team  that  supported  the  Display  and  Algorithm  IPTs,  worked  with  S&L
public  safety  representatives  to  help  design  equipment  that  would  meet  the
needs of the first responders. Some of the entities who participated included:
fire departments, law enforcement, and emergency management from Mont-
gomery  County,  MD,  Virginia  Department  of  Emergency  Management,  and
the  Government  of  the  District  of  Columbia.  Additionally,  the  Human  Fac-
tors Team coordinated its activities with other S&L public safety officials as
well as with the U.S. Coast Guard, and Customs and Border Protection.

— Training  Curriculum:  DNDO  worked  with  the  S&L  Stakeholder  Working
Group  to  review  and  gather  training  requirements,  as  well  as  develop  cur-
riculum for various levels and types of preventive rad/nuc detection training
courses.

— Alarm Resolution Response Protocols: DNDO incorporated S&L public safety
agencies  into  the  development  of  detailed  protocols  for  resolving  detection
alarms.

— Preventive  Rad/Nuc  Detection  Program  Management  Handbook  and  Com-
mercial  Vehicle  Inspection  (CVI)  Rad/Nuc  Module:  DNDO  developed  both  of
these  products  during  numerous  working  sessions  with  a  multi-jurisdic-
tional,  multi-disciplinary  audience  of  S&L  public  safety  officials.  The  pro-
gram management handbook provides consistent guidance for building or en-
hancing  State  and  local  preventive  rad/nuc  detection  programs.  The  CVI
Rad/Nuc  Module  provides  guidance  to  S&L  jurisdictions  that  may  choose  to
incorporate preventive rad/nuc detection into their CVI program in a variety
of ways, including within mobile weigh station operations, within CVI road-
side inspection operations, or by using relocatable portal monitors on by-pass
routes.

Questions submitted by Representative Judy Biggert

RDD
Q1a. How  is  DHS  implementing  plans  to  protect  against  radiological  weapons  and

radiological dispersal devices?
How does DHS evaluate the Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD) threat? What
studies  have  been  done  to  analyze  the  potential  damage  and  consequences  of
an RDD attack? How does DHS distinguish its mission and R&D program on
RDDs from that of DOE, DTRA, the military services and the FBI? What plans
and  programs  does  DHS  have  to  analyze,  mitigate,  and  respond  to  the  RDD
threat?  How  would  DHS  determine  the  source  of  an  RDD  attack?  What  data
bases exist to support this effort? Since such an attack would be different from
an  actual  nuclear  explosion,  how  do  these  data  bases  differ  from  data  bases
maintained  to  determine  the  characteristics  of  foreign  nuclear  weapons?  (The
specific  answer  would  probably  be  classified  but  the  general  question  is:  Are
the data bases the same or different?)

A1a. DHS/DNDO has a three tiered approach, closely coordinated with other agen-
cies, to protect the Nation from RDD devices. This approach includes: 1) identifying
the potential radiological materials that could be used as an effective RDD; 2) secur-
ing and/or eliminating these sources and; 3) pursuing ways to make the commercial
devices that employ radioactive sources more tamper proof. Examples of DNDO ini-
tiatives are documented below:

— DNDO is working with federal partners (NRC, DOE), industry, and licensees
in  the  United  States  to  investigate  vulnerabilities  and  identify  solutions  to
reduce  the  risk  of  unauthorized  access  to  the  Cesium-137  sources  found  in
irradiators used in medical and research facilities.

— DNDO is participating with the NRC, other federal agencies, and the Agree-
ment  States  in  setting  the  data  requirements  for  the  national  source  track-
ing system to improve the usefulness of the database for source security.

— DNDO  is  participating  in  an  effort  to  promote  the  design  and  production  of
non-nuclear alternatives for industrial devices that currently use radioactive
sources.

— DNDO  serves  as  the  DHS  representative  on  the  NRC-chaired,  Radiation
Source Protection and Security Task Force, also known as the Energy Policy
Act  Task  Force.  The  Task  Force  is  responsible  for  a  continuing  comprehen-
sive review of the status of radioactive source security and for reporting peri-
odically to Congress on that status.

— DNDO is participating with the NRC, other federal agencies, and the Agree-
ment States in the Alternative Technologies subgroup, as part of the Energy
Policy Act Task Force. This subgroup is investigating the feasibility of alter-
natives to the commercial use of certain higher risk radioactive sources.

— DNDO is participating with the NRC, other federal agencies, and the Agree-
ment  States  Cesium  Chloride  subgroup,  as  part  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act
Task  Force.  This  subgroup  is  investigating  methods  to  reduce  the  RDD  risk
from this particular radioactive source.

Furthermore,  DNDO  is  beginning  engagements  with  six  UASI  Tier  I  Urban
Areas,  followed  by  the  additional  39  UASI  Tier  II  Urban  Areas  by  the  end  of  FY
2009,  as  part  of  an  operational  implementation  and  outreach  strategy  that  aims  to
improve State and local capabilities to detect and interdict radiological and nuclear
threats.  Coordinated  implementation  support  includes:  initial  engagements  with
senior leaders from the Department of Energy, CBP, and the FBI; enlistment of the
FBI’s  Joint  Terrorism  Task  Forces;  formulation  of  initial  preventive  rad/nuc  detec-
tion program plans; threat briefings; response and protocol development; and train-
ing and exercise options.

Q1b. How does DHS evaluate the Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD) threat? What
studies  have  been  done  to  analyze  the  potential  damage  and  consequences  of
an RDD attack?

A1b. DHS and DNDO use a combination of intelligence community and official gov-
ernment sources, as well as our own assessments, to evaluate a range of radiological
and  nuclear  threats,  including  those  posed  by  RDDs.  The  RDD  threat  is  evaluated
from  both  a  threat  and  vulnerability  standpoint—how  susceptible  are  we  to  this
type  of  attack,  and  what  can  be  done  to  detect  and  prevent  the  attack.  Numerous
studies,  both  classified  and  unclassified  have  been  conducted  (including  several
under DHS sponsorship at the National Labs) that have characterized in detail the
significant  potential  damage  and  consequences  that  could  result  from  an  RDD  at-
tack.
Q1c. How  does  DHS  distinguish  its  mission  and  R&D  program  on  RDDs  from  that

of DOE, DTRA, the military services and the FBI?

A1c. From an R&D perspective, there are three key agencies doing R&D for nuclear
detection: DOE/NA–22 focuses on R&D to support non-proliferation, proliferation de-
tection, and counter-terrorism; DOD/DTRA focuses on R&D to support international
interdiction  and  response,  and  counter-proliferation;  and  DHS/DNDO  focuses  on
R&D to support prevention of a domestic event. Specifically, DOE and DTRA assist
in the securing and detection of illicit trafficking of sources from or within other na-
tions, which reduce the risk of RDDs domestically. The FBI brings to bear the inves-
tigative  and  law  enforcement  databases  and  professional  relationships  that  DNDO
relies  on  to  make  asset  deployment  decisions  for  potential  domestic  RDD  threats.
We  routinely  coordinate  with  all  of  these  agencies  for  ongoing  projects  and  new
announcements.  This  allows  each  agency  to  leverage  technology  advancements
gained  from  other  investments  and  transition  needed  technologies  to  users  more
rapidly.  In  addition,  close  coordination  prevents  redundancy  in  these  R&D  pro-
grams.

With  respect  to  R&D  for  DNDO’s  nuclear  forensics  mission,  DNDO’s  National
Technical  Nuclear  Forensics  Center  leads  a  centralized,  formalized  interagency  co-
ordination  process  that  ensures  agencies’  R&D  programs  and  initiatives  are  jointly
planned and executed in a manner consistent with roles and missions defined in na-
tional policy guidance.
Q1d. What  plans  and  programs  does  DHS  have  to  analyze,  mitigate,  and  respond

to the RDD threat?

A1d. DHS plans and programs related to RDDs may be divided into prevention and
detection, which DNDO concentrates on, and mitigation and response, which are ad-
dressed  by  other  DHS  components  such  as  the  Directorate  for  National  Protection
and  Programs,  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency,  and  the  Office  of
Health  Affairs;  these  programs  have  recently  been  re-organized  and  realigned.  A
significant  DHS-wide  and  interagency  effort  has  gone  into  preparing  for  RDD
events,  including  contingency  planning  for  the  National  Planning  Scenarios,  one  of
which  is  an  RDD.  DHS  analysis  of  the  RDD  threat  is  ongoing.  The  generic  effects
of  different  types  of  RDDs  employed  in  urban  areas  have  been  modeled,  with  some
U.S.  city-specific  data  generated  to  develop  possible  RDD  scenarios.  The  predomi-
nant  part  of  DNDO’s  mission  involves  the  detection  and  prevention  of  radiological
and nuclear terrorist events prior to the event happening.

DHS  recognizes  that  an  RDD  threat  could  emanate  from  within  our  borders,  so
we are also working to improve detection and interdiction capabilities within our do-
mestic  interior  as  part  of  a  broader  layered  defense.  While  detection  at  POEs,  in-
cluding systems that screen containers at seaports, is an important part of the solu-
tion,  we  must  also  develop  solutions  for  non-POE  applications  for  maritime,  avia-
tion,  and  land  modes,  including  next-generation  human  portable  detection  equip-
ment and mobile standoff assets. For example, DNDO is making progress to replace
personal radiation detectors (pagers) now held by first responders with equally com-
pact  and  more  accurate  devices  that  can  detect  both  gamma  and  neutron  radiation
and identify isotopes of RDDs.

To  improve  source  security  and  decrease  the  availability  of  radioactive  sources  to
our  adversaries,  DNDO  is  working  with  other  USG  agencies  and  with  industry  to
further  protect  and  account  for  radioactive  sources.  DNDO  is  working  to  eliminate
the sources within the United States that could be used for RDDs and also working
to track radioactive sources of concern (industrial and medical) for security and situ-
ational  awareness  purposes.  As  a  part  of  an  interagency  effort,  DNDO  also  works
with  international  counterparts  to  help  other  countries  prevent  and  detect  radio-
logical or nuclear threats closer to the source.

Finally,  we  must  remain  vigilant  and  build  greater  public  awareness  of  ‘‘what  to
look  for,’’  pre-detonation  signs  of  radiological  or  nuclear  threat  anomalies  in  neigh-
borhoods,  workplaces,  and  transportation  corridors  that  could  launch  a  coordinated
response to stop the attack.

The modeling work that is part of our initial analysis of the RDD threat can also
help  in  post-event  mitigation.  DNDO  has  worked  to  computer  model  the  effects  of
an  RDD  detonated  in  an  urban  area,  allowing  us  to  understand  the  size  and  scope
of  the  impact  on  the  population.  In  the  event  of  an  actual  RDD  event,  DNDO  will
be a source of radiological/nuclear technical expertise and will support FEMA, HHS
and other federal agencies to mitigate the effects.
Q1e. How would DHS determine the source of an RDD attack? What data bases exist
to  support  this  effort?  Since  such  an  attack  would  be  different  from  an  actual
nuclear  explosion,  how  do  these  data  bases  differ  from  data  bases  maintained
to  determine  the  characteristics  of  foreign  nuclear  weapons?  (The  specific  an-
swer  would  probably  be  classified  but  the  general  question  is—are  the  data
bases the same or different?)

A1e. In  formulating  the  response  to  these  questions,  it  is  understood  that  the
‘‘source  of  an  RDD  attack’’  refers  to  ‘‘who  is  responsible’’  and  this  includes  as  one
input  the  ‘‘source  of  material.’’  It  is  further  understood  that  the  nuclear  forensics
process is necessarily interagency, with respective roles and responsibilities defined
by statutes and policy directives. As part of the interagency effort DNDO is respon-
sible  for  developing  a  ‘‘pre-detonation  materials  forensic  analysis  capability  in  sup-
port of the lead federal agency. In most instances the FBI will be the LFA and will
be responsible for leading the interagency attribution effort. The following response
addresses each question in turn:
Q1f. How would DHS determine the source of an RDD attack?
A1f. As indicated DHS is not responsible for determining the source of an RDD at-
tack.  DHS  is  improving/developing  a  pre-detonation  materials  forensic  analysis  ca-
pability that will be used principally by the FBI in support of its overarching attri-
bution efforts. In general however, the key forensic processes supporting attribution
of an RDD attack are described below:

— Material  evidence  would  be  collected  from  the  scene  that  would  contain  nu-
clear  forensic  signatures  indicative  of  the  material  source  and  RDD  design.
Conventional  law  enforcement  forensic  samples  related  to  the  conventional
(non-nuclear) explosion would also be collected.

— The  evidence  would  be  analyzed  at  laboratories  that  have  been  equipped  to
conduct both radiochemical analyses and traditional forensic examinations of
contaminated evidence.

— Many  databases  housed  in  various  federal  agencies  exist  to  support  conven-
tional law enforcement forensics. Regarding the radioactive material source,
databases are developed for this type of application.

— Data from analyses of the radiological material will be interpreted by the ap-
propriate  laboratory  and,  as  required,  peer  reviewed  by  a  group  of  experts
to help identify the source of the material. The material’s source is one input
that will be used to address the question of ‘‘who is responsible?’’ Other tra-
ditional  forensics  will  be  utilized,  and  all  the  technical  information  will  be
combined with law enforcement and intelligence information to help develop
the case for attribution (i.e., all source information fusion).

Q1g. What data bases exist to support this effort?
A1g. The President directed the development of an integrated system of information
from  all  sources  concerning  worldwide  nuclear  material  holdings  and  their  security
status, the Nuclear Materials Information Program.
Q1h. Since such an attack would be different from an actual nuclear explosion, how
do these data bases differ from data bases maintained to determine the charac-
teristics  of  foreign  nuclear  weapons?  (The  specific  answer  would  probably  be
classified  but  the  general  question  is—are  the  data  bases  the  same  or  dif-
ferent?)

A1h. Due to fundamental differences in device design and materials used, there are
inherent  differences  between  the  data  captured  in  databases  of  RDD  and  nuclear
weapon  characteristics.  In  general,  an  RDD  is  very  different  from  a  nuclear  device
that  produces  yield.  Essentially,  the  RDD  databases  cover  two  types  of  materials:
1) radiological sources and 2) nuclear fuels. Radiological source information includes
information  concerning  commercial,  industrial,  and  government  produced  or  owned

radiological  sources,  and  the  nuclear  fuels  information  captures  reactor  fuels  infor-
mation  from  commercial  power,  research,  and  government  reactors.  For  both  types
of materials, much of the data are derived from manufacturing information and in-
cludes isotopic and elemental information, material information on the cladding and
other structures (as applicable), date of manufacture, intended use, etc. Foreign nu-
clear weapons characteristics databases do not address radiological sources or reac-
tor  fuels  (and  are  highly  classified).  Therefore,  the  databases  are  inherently  quite
different.

Outreach and Support
Q2. How is DHS implementing its outreach and support of regional assets? How are
priorities  set  for  funding  regional  assets?  How  are  regional  programs  coordi-
nated  across  all  of  DHS?  What  is  the  schedule  for  providing  support  to  all  re-
gions of the country?

A2. DNDO, through its Operations Support Directorate and Office of State & Local
Affairs,  reaches  out  to  State  and  local  authorities  and  helps  them  prioritize  their
demand  for  federal  support  capabilities  as  well  as  identify  their  requirements  for
the  design,  requirements,  and  deployment  of  detection  systems  within  the  United
States. DNDO is beginning engagements with the six (6) UASI Tier I Urban Areas,
followed  by  the  additional  39  UASI  Tier  II  Urban  Areas  into  the  domestic  layer  of
the GNDA by the end of FY 2009.

Working closely with the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, DNDO ensures
that  national  level  expertise  is  in  place  to  support  prompt  alarm  adjudication.
Reachback  capability  gives  the  responder  community  access  to  National  Laboratory
expertise to analyze spectral data and determine if a threat is present. We have es-
tablished  procedures  and  connectivity  to  three  regional  reachback  laboratories  as
well  as  the  National  Operations  Center.  We  routinely  drill  and  exercise  reachback
capabilities, and have the capability to adjudicate all domestically referred primary-
level radiation detection alarms. DNDO also works to ensure that regional preventa-
tive rad/nuc detection programs are coordinated across all of DHS. Coordinated sup-
port  includes:  initial  engagements  with  senior  leaders  from  the  Department  of  En-
ergy,  CBP,  and  the  FBI;  enlistment  of  the  FBI’s  Joint  Terrorism  Task  Forces;  for-
mulation  of  initial  preventative  rad/nuc  detection  program  plans;  threat  briefings;
response and protocol development; and training and exercise options.

Through  the  Southeast  Transportation  Corridor  Pilot  (SETCP),  DNDO  is  laying
the  groundwork  for  how  DHS  can  encourage  individual  states  to  look  at  preventive
rad/nuc detection as a necessary mission, as well as how states can coordinate with
each  other  to  regionally  address  rad/nuc  threats.  SETCP  works  through  Regional
Task  Teams,  comprising  of  state  representatives  from  the  law  enforcement,  radio-
logical health, and emergency planning/operations communities. Dialogue with these
representatives  was  coordinated  through  the  State  Homeland  Security  Advisors,
both  individually  within  each  state  and  collectively  across  the  region.  As  a  result,
the  participating  states  have  shared  goals,  technical  approaches,  concepts  of  oper-
ation  (CONOPS)  and  lessons  learned.  In  addition,  DNDO  has  solidified  support
through the administration of two sets of Cooperative Agreements that have placed
new  radiation  detection  systems  into  the  hands  of  individual  states,  but  with  an
overlay  of  regional  CONOPS  to  improve  the  use  of  these  devices  and  to  establish
connectivity to the DNDO Joint Analysis Center and to Regional Reachback centers
(also established by DNDO).

The  following  Cooperative  Agreement  awards  have  been  made  to  States  partici-
pating in the DNDO Southeast Transportation Corridor Pilot (SETCP). A portion of
these awards (GA, KY, SC, TN, and VA) were awarded 26 Sept 2006. The remainder
(AL,  DC,  FL,  MS,  NC)  are  scheduled  for  award  on  or  about  1  June  2007.  NOTE:
Virginia  is  scheduled  to  receive  an  additional  equipment  allocation  in  FY2007  (an
ASP Variant L unit) under their original Cooperative Agreement.

These Cooperative Agreements comprise a combination of cash grants, equipment
grants,  and  services  (such  as  site  design  and  installation  of  fixed  portal  hardware).
Cash  grants  supported  local  purchase  of  detector  hardware,  plus  travel  and  allow-
able personnel costs for participation in SETCP-sponsored training and exercises.

Under  the  SETCP,  the  States  are  also  being  supported  by  the  development  of
Concepts  of  Operation  (CONOPS)  to  guide  the  use  of  the  issued  equipment.  Each
State is also receiving assistance in establishing a data exchange capability for pre-
ventive rad/nuc detection data, both within the state and between the state and the
DNDO Joint Analysis Center (JAC).

Under  Securing  the  Cities  Initiative  (STC),  DNDO  has  led  a  consortium  of  S&L
stakeholders in the New York City region to establish a region-wide coordinated ra-
diation  detection  and  interdiction  capability.  This  effort  includes  agencies  from  the
states  of  NY,  NJ,  and  CT.  An  overarching  STC  Working  Group  was  established  in
January  2007,  with  several  specialized  committees  including  the  Equipment  Work-
ing Group. Through interactive discussions and live technology demonstrations, this
group  has  addressed  responder  operational  equipment  requirements  in  an  effort  to
focus  DNDO  acquisition  and  research  efforts,  and  has  agreed  upon  an  initial  set  of
equipment to be procured and distributed to responders throughout the region. This
group  has  also  brought  developers  of  DNDO’s  SUV-based  mobile  Advanced
Spectroscopic Portal System face-to-face with the operators in the region to facilitate
the  design  process.  Additionally,  the  group  is  addressing  long-term  sustainability
issues such as equipment maintenance and calibration on a regional basis.

DNDO also has a strong working relationship with the DHS Office of Grants and
Training  (G&T),  particularly  regarding  the  development  and  delivery  of  preventa-
tive  rad/nuc  detection  training  courses.  DNDO,  in  coordination  with  G&T,  develops
and executes training courses, table tops, and other exercises and operational drills
to  provide  federal,  State  and  local  agencies  with  structure  processes  to  refine  and
standardize  their  procedures  for  the  management  of  issues  related  to  detection,
alarm adjudication, incident reporting, and control and security of radioactive mate-
rials.  This  year’s  plans  include  training  for  1,200  law  enforcement  personnel  and
first responders. In FY 2008, DNDO has a goal of training 2,400 individuals. DNDO
also worked with G&T to ensure consistency between HSPD–8 guidance and DNDO
programs.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Gerald  L.  Epstein,  Senior  Fellow  for  Science  and  Security,  Homeland

Security Program, Center for Strategic and International Studies

Questions submitted by Chairman David Wu
Q1. You pointed out in your written testimony that classified biological research can
result  in  suspicion  of  the  S&T  Directorate’s  intent,  and  suggest  that  allowing
outside observers to help oversee classified biological research can help alleviate
some  of  the  suspicion.  Is  the  biology  community  currently  involved  in  helping
oversee S&T’s biological research? If so, has S&T been providing outside observ-
ers  with  adequate  information  and  access?  If  not,  what  do  you  recommend
should be done?

A1. At  present  I  am  not  aware  of  a  mechanism  by  which  members  of  the  non-gov-
ernmental  biology  community  have  the  opportunity  to  review  the  entire  biological
research program, or the entire set of classified biological research activities, within
the Department of Homeland Security. However, there are a number of mechanisms
through  which  member  of  the  non-governmental  biology  community  with  appro-
priate security clearances have or could have the opportunity to review specific bio-
logical research activities, including classified ones, that are conducted or sponsored
by  DHS.  Without  claiming  that  this  list  is  necessarily  complete,  these  mechanisms
include:

• Review  by  panels  of  the  National  Academies  (the  National  Academy  of
Sciences,  the  National  Academy  of  Engineering,  the  Institute  of  Medicine,
and/or the National Research Council)
Federal  agencies  including  DHS  often  make  use  of  the  National  Academies
to  review  research  or  address  technical  issues  involving  their  research  pro-
grams.  Academy  panels  have  the  ability  to  obtain  security  clearances  for
panel  members  to  enable  them  to  address  classified  research.  One  particu-
larly  relevant  panel  is  the  Standing  Committee  on  Biodefense  Analysis  and
Countermeasures, the principal function of which is ‘‘to coordinate studies re-
quested by the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center re-
lated to biodefense analysis in support of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity’’ 1 According to National Academies’ staff supporting this panel, all mem-
bers of this panel, which includes distinguished academic biological scientists,
have  been  granted  or  have  applied  for  security  clearances  at  the  SECRET
level,  and  they  have  received  classified  briefings  in  the  past  on  the  subject
of risk assessment. This panel is in a position to receive unclassified or classi-
fied  briefings  (at  the  SECRET  level  or  lower)  on  specific  research  activities
associated with the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Cen-
ter  (NBACC),  although  I  do  not  believe  that  it  has  yet  been  asked  to  do  so.2
(Disclosure:  Although  I  am  not  a  member  of  this  panel,  I  have  participated
in several of its meetings as an invited guest speaker, including briefings and
discussions on assuring compliance with the Biological Weapons Convention.)

• NBACC Scientific Advisory Committee

Late  in  2006,  DHS  awarded  a  contract  to  the  Battelle  National  Biodefense
Institute  to  operate  NBACC,  and  this  contractor  is  still  in  the  process  of  es-
tablishing  some  of  its  management  structures.  According  to  staff  within  the
Department  of  Homeland  Security  S&T  Directorate,  to  which  NBACC  re-
ports, Battelle intends to create an outside scientific advisory panel, including
academic  and  other  non-governmental  scientists,  that  will  presumably  will
have  some  standing  responsibility  to  review  and  oversee  the  NBACC  sci-
entific program, including its classified aspects.

• External Reviews by Entities such as the JASONs.

(http://www7.nationalacademies.org/BAST/

measures 
BAST¥Biodefense¥Analysis¥Committee.html)

2 Among  other  things,  NBACC  will  perform  studies  and  laboratory  experiments—including
classified  ones—to  ‘‘fill  in  information  gaps  to  better  understand  current  and  future  biological
threats,  assess  vulnerabilities,  conduct  risk  assessments,  and  determine  potential  impacts  in
order to guide the development of countermeasures. . .’’ (Fact Sheet: National Biodefense Anal-
ysis  and  Countermeasures  Center,’’  February  24,  2005,  http://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/
press¥release¥0627.shtm).  Given  its  role  in  understanding  potential  threats,  NBACC  activi-
ties—and  in  particular  classified  NBACC  activities—are  likely  to  be  controversial  with  respect
to treaty compliance.

Should  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  so  wish,  it  could  ask  for  re-
views  of  its  activities,  including  classified  activities,  by  independent  entities
such  as  the  JASONs,  a  group  of  non-governmental,  largely  academic  sci-
entists  with  high  security  clearances  who  do  analyses  and  studies  for  a  wide
range of government agencies, including agencies in the national security sec-
tor. Members of this group can review highly classified programs.
Although  originally  comprised  almost  exclusively  of  physicists  and  other
physical  scientists,  the  JASONs  have  been  expanding  their  domain  of  exper-
tise  and  now  include  three  nationally  known  biologists.  To  take  on  any  sig-
nificant  role  in  reviewing  life  science  research,  this  complement  of  life
sciences would have to be expanded considerably, but at least there is an ini-
tial life sciences capability today. I am not aware that the JASONs have been
asked  to  review  any  of  DHS’  classified  biological  activities,  and  they  would
typically not serve in a standing oversight role, but (subject to available per-
sonnel) they could be enlisted for specific studies.

I  believe  that  DHS  is  providing  adequate  information  and  access  to  external  re-
views it has asked for, but I do not believe that outside reviews are currently being
done on a systematic or comprehensive basis. (The DHS S&T program does undergo
regular  program  reviews  by  scientists  and  others  who  are  within  government  but
outside DHS, including some from agencies such as NIH that are outside the tradi-
tional  national  security  community.)  Recognizing  that  it  may  be  quite  difficult  and
time-consuming for an outside group to be briefed on, and to probe in depth, an en-
tire research portfolio—a task that clearly depends on the size and scope of that re-
search  portfolio—I  would  recommend  that  DHS  implement  a  process  in  which  non-
governmental scientists with appropriate security clearances have more regular and
more systematic opportunity to review the suite of classified DHS biological research
activities.  I  note  that  DHS  is  currently  implementing  a  process  by  which  its  entire
research  portfolio—both  unclassified  and  classified—is  reviewed  by  senior  Depart-
mental officials to ensure compliance with laws, treaties, and policy. This is a tiered
review  in  which  activities  that  warrant  higher  scrutiny  get  it—and  a  similar
‘‘tiering’’  philosophy  could  be  applied  to  external  technical  review  to  DHS  as  well.
Since  government  agencies  other  than  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security
might  also  conduct  classified  biological  research  activities,  it  is  also  important  that
government-wide  activities  are  reviewed  with  respect  to  technical  merit  and  treaty
compliance,  and  such  reviews  gain  credibility  to  the  extent  that  they  involve  mem-
bers  of  the  non-governmental  biology  community  (and  other  outside  observers).  My
conversations  with  senior  government  officials  in  several  different  agencies  assure
me  that  they  are  aware  of  the  importance  of  such  reviews  and  are  working  to  de-
velop processes to facilitate them. I would like to highlight two relevant efforts here.
• The  Biological  Sciences  Experts  Group  (BSEG)  of  the  National

Counterproliferation Center
In response to the recommendation of the Commission on the Intelligence Ca-
pabilities  of  the  United  States  Regarding  Weapons  of  Mass  Destruction  that
the  Intelligence  Community  engage  more  effectively  with  life  scientists  out-
side of the U.S. government, the National Counterproliferation Center within
the  Office  of  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  has  created  a  Biological
Sciences  Experts  Group  (BSEG).  This  group,  on  which  I  serve,  consists  of
non-governmental members with expertise in a range of disciplines associated
with  the  biological  sciences.  Its  members  serve  strictly  in  an  advisory  capac-
ity. and they have no standing responsibility to review or assess classified bi-
ological  research.  However,  members  are  available  to  provide  advice  on  spe-
cific  scientific  and  technical  activities  relevant  to  the  Intelligence  Commu-
nity’s  missions,  and  they  do  constitute  a  mechanism  to  provide  selected  IC
activities  (which  could  include  biological  research)  with  independent,  exter-
nal,  technical  review.  Speaking  for  myself,  I  believe  it  would  be  appropriate
for BSEG members to address the credibility, legitimacy, and technical merit
of  IC  biological  research  activities.  Moreover,  I  believe—and  have  no  reason
to think my colleagues disagree—that the IC staffers working with this group
are  genuinely  interested  in  obtaining  independent  and  non-governmental
views,  and  that  they  take  seriously  the  requests  and  conclusions  of  BSEG
members.

• Wider  technical  and  programmatic  engagement  and  peer  review  by

security-cleared non-governmental experts
Allowing  more  U.S.  classified  biological  research  activities  to  undergo  exter-
nal technical reviews would require increasing the availability of external re-
viewers who have security clearances. In the spirit of the WMD Commission’s

charge  to  the  Intelligence  Community  to  increase  its  engagement  with  the
U.S. biological research community, efforts are underway to identify precisely
these people—technical experts outside of government who currently hold se-
curity  clearances—to  ask  them  if  they  would  be  willing,  on  occasion,  to  per-
form technical reviews of classified projects.

Question submitted by Representative Phil Gingrey
Q1. How  does  the  difference  in  structure  between  the  end-to-end,  research  to  oper-
ations, responsibilities of DNDO and the research-only management activities of
the  S&T  Directorate  affect  their  ability  to  provide  technologies  that  reflect  ma-
ture operational concepts and systems design?

A1. The  difference  in  structure  would  likely  complicate  future  efforts  to  merge
DNDO  with  the  S&T  Directorate,  but  I  don’t  see  that  it  necessarily  makes  either
of  these  organizations  better  in  general  at  reflecting  mature  operational  concepts
and systems designs than the other.

Even  though  DNDO’s  role  extends  further  ‘‘downstream’’  than  S&T’s  does  in
terms  of  developing  the  architecture  in  which  its  products  will  be  used,  neither
DNDO nor S&T is likely to be the employer of the individual who will be using that
piece of equipment at the field. Both of these agencies, therefore, must overcome the
difficulty of designing equipment for someone who is ultimately not under the agen-
cies’ direct control, and to which that agency might not have direct access.

DNDO  has  the  explicit  charge  of  developing  an  architecture  for  nuclear  detection
in addition to developing and procuring nuclear detectors themselves, whereas other
DHS  S&T  activities  seek  to  develop  and  deploy  technology  to  support  concepts,  ar-
chitectures, or requirements that are either in place already or are being developed
by  other  DHS  offices.  (Biowatch  had  been  an  exception  to  this  when  its  system  ar-
chitecture  as  well  as  its  individual  detectors  were  developed  by  DHS  S&T,  but  re-
sponsibility  for  the  overall  architecture  and  operation  of  that  program  has  since
been  moved  out  of  DHS  S&T.)  In  this  sense,  DNDO  may  have  greater  freedom  to
design  systems  and  sensors  that  complement  each  other  than  DHS  S&T,  since  it
would presumably have fewer external constituencies or agencies to deal with. How-
ever, this does not necessarily mean that a DNDO system will better reflect ‘‘mature
operational  concepts,’’  and  could  in  fact  imply  the  opposite:  if  DNDO  does  not  have
to meet requirements as established by another agency, it may be more tempted to
set  its  own  aggressive  technical  milestones  that  draw  on  less  mature  operational
concepts. However, I am not aware of any specific evidence to that effect, and I am
not sure this effect is very strong in any event.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Jonah  J.  Czerwinski,  Managing  Consultant,  IBM  Global  Business

Services; Senior Fellow, Homeland Security, IBM Global Leadership Initiative

Questions submitted by Chairman David Wu
Q1. In your opinion, what are the benefits of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office’s
Securing the Cities Initiative? Is this type of project likely to be successful in pre-
venting the unlawful transport and detonation of nuclear or radiological devices
in  the  U.S.?  Do  you  believe  that  the  requested  funding  level  of  $30  million  for
FY 2008 is appropriate?

A1. The  DNDO’s  Securing  the  Cities  Initiative  (SCI)  reflects  an  investment  in  an
important part of a layered defense. While efforts to secure sources of nuclear mate-
rial  in  troubled  areas  remain  critical,  in  addition  to  interdiction  operations  like  the
Proliferation  Security  Initiative,  efforts  like  SCI  help  close  an  important  gap  in  to-
day’s detection mission.

Because even the most effective global effort to stop illicit movement of dangerous
nuclear  material  will  be  less  than  100  percent  successful,  it  is  wise  to  consider  do-
mestic detection efforts in major cities. A perpetrator may be able to obtain nuclear
material  and  evade  detection  overseas,  en  route,  and  across  the  U.S.  border  which
is  known  to  be  porous  in  parts.  If  this  occurs,  it  is  likely  that  intelligence  commu-
nities  will  have  some  warning  and  be  able  to  provide  law  enforcement  and  other
authorities  with  valuable  information  to  aid  in  an  apprehension.  An  SCI  effort
would  greatly  help  augment  intelligence  and  law  enforcement  officials  by  providing
added  warning  and  more  accurate  information  about  the  location  of  nuclear  mate-
rial.

The scenario of nuclear material smuggled across U.S. borders, while dangerously
possible,  is  perhaps  as  likely  as  nuclear  material  obtained  from  within  the  United
States for use against a major U.S. city. Dangerous source material for a dirty bomb
can be found in unsecured commercial locations or universities where nuclear mate-
rial is located for legitimate uses. If a perpetrator steals this material, SCI capabili-
ties provide a better ability to locate and isolate the material.

Whether  or  not  SCI  will  be  successful  is  difficult  to  say  at  this  stage,  but  some
precedence already exists that indicates such an effort could indeed be effective. The
Department of Defense (DOD) already deploys their own version of SCI focused ex-
clusively on protecting bases within the U.S. Detectors are in place surrounding the
bases  to  detect  a  potential  nuclear  threat  in  vicinity  of  the  base.  Ongoing  R&D  for
these programs is focused on increasing the ability to detect source material moving
at  greater  speeds  along  public  roads  that  lead  to  these  bases.  The  potential  for  co-
operation between DNDO and DOD should be pursued for mutual benefit.

Lastly,  DNDO’s  budget  request  for  SCI  deserves  attention.  The  Nation’s  invest-
ment  in  SCI  should  reflect  a  commitment  to  thinking  creatively  and  responsibly
about  the  threat  of  nuclear  terrorism  in  America’s  cities.  The  nearly  $11  billion  to
be  spent  on  missile  defense  next  fiscal  year  places  the  SCI  budget  in  perspective.
With an overall DNDO budget of approximately $550 million, dedicating $30 million
to Securing the Cities seems appropriate. At this early stage, a healthier investment
like  this  would  help  identify  more  promising  routes  to  success  while  weeding  out
potential dead-ends. SCI is equal parts R&D and strategy.
Q2. From  the  FY  2008  budget  request  and  information  I’ve  received  from  DNDO,  it
seems that deployment of detection technologies is limited to highly-visible, high-
ly-trafficked  ports  of  entry  with  relatively  little  attention  given  to  intercepting
smuggled  materials  in  foreign  countries  or  detecting  materials  smuggled  across
more  remote  borders.  Is  this  an  appropriate  way  to  deploy  detection  tech-
nologies?  If  not,  what  factors  should  DNDO  consider  when  determining  where
to deploy their detectors?

A2. The  deployment  strategy  of  detectors  and  other  countermeasures  in  combating
smuggling nuclear weapons may be one of the most important considerations in as-
sessing the DNDO strategy. However, that the strategy and budget seem to indicate
a  focus  on  domestic  choke  points  (i.e.,  highly  trafficked  points  of  entry)  is  appro-
priate at this stage for two reasons. First, efforts to detect or otherwise counter the
threat  of  smuggled  nuclear  material  overseas  are  mainly  conducted  by  other  agen-
cies,  but  there  is  an  important  role  for  the  DNDO.  Second,  the  DNDO  was  wise  to
begin  their  deployment  strategy  at  major  points  of  entry  first  given  the  priority  of
closing  obvious  gaps  soonest,  but  they  must  move  forward  with  a  plan  to  deploy

along less populated, and therefore less guarded, sections of the U.S. border, among
other improvements.

The effort to combat smuggled nuclear material is a global one. Indeed the DNDO
was  originally  named  the  National  Nuclear  Defense  Office  to  reflect  a  broader  mis-
sion  than  the  one  it  is  perceived  to  have  today.  After  working  its  way  through  the
interagency process, this title lost the word ‘‘national,’’ which was replaced with Do-
mestic,  and  the  word  ‘‘defense’’  became  detection,  in  an  apparent  effort  to  winnow
the mission of this new office. In practice, this makes some sense since both the De-
partment  of  Energy  and  the  Department  of  Defense  also  play  a  role  in  this  area.
The DHS office was given the detection mission only, but that has since evolved for
good  reason.  Today,  the  DNDO  works  very  closely  with  other  agencies  to  develop
not  only  new  capabilities,  but  also  the  global  deployment  strategy  that  reflects  and
informs the use of detection efforts by all federal agencies including DOE, DOD, and
others.

When  the  DNDO  was  created  in  April  2004,  the  White  House  placed  significant
emphasis on deploying detection capabilities quickly and in the most needed places.
This  had  both  positive  and  negative  effects.  The  priority  on  deploying  detectors
quickly  naturally  sacrificed  quality  in  the  short  run.  The  ‘‘pagers’’  and  first-genera-
tion portal monitors (RPMs) suffered from poor selectivity that forced them to signal
an alarm when encountering non-threatening materials that naturally contain radi-
ation.  This  led  to  news  reports  and  internal  assessments  that  showed  RPMs  sig-
naling a ‘‘hit’’ when only ceramic tile or other commercial material was found in an
a  container  or  truck  hold.  The  other  major  trade-off  that  resulted  from  an  acceler-
ated  deployment  schedule  was  the  low  sensitivity  of  the  earlier  detectors  (many  of
which  are  still  in  use).  Low  sensitivity  leads  many  detectors  to  be  unable  to  sense
the  presence  of  source  material  because,  ironically,  HEU  and  other  elements  actu-
ally  give  off  very  low  levels  of  radiation  prior  to  detonation.  Current  research  and
development  underway  at  DNDO  already  shows  major  progress  in  both  selectivity
and sensitivity in a variety of settings.

The  priority  of  placing  detection  capabilities  at  highly  trafficked  points  of  entry
reflects  a  judgment  call  the  DNDO  and  DHS  leadership  had  to  make  at  the  time
DNDO  stood  up  and  began  using  its  first  budget  in  FY  2005.  Given  limited  re-
sources,  the  constraints  of  a  new  organization,  and  an  evolving  threat,  the  choice
was made to start with the most likely choke points based on traffic patterns (both
licit  and  illicit)  and  the  risk  these  areas  posed  to  surrounding  infrastructure  and
populations.  Over  time,  the  DNDO  plan  reflects  an  intention  to  contribute  to  anti-
terrorism programs overseas by supporting the DHS-DOE-State Department Secure
Freight  Initiative  and  NATO’s  Operation  Active  Endeavor.  This  is  a  positive  devel-
opment  that  also  indicates  the  aggressive  progress  DNDO  is  making  in  the  field  of
nuclear detection. Future development in DNDO’s deployment strategy certainly in-
cludes  efforts  like  Securing  the  Cities,  but  also  networked  detection  capabilities  in
less  traveled  sections  of  the  border  to  close  those  serious  gaps  you  cited.  An  impor-
tant improvement in strategy would include the use of decoys, hidden detectors, and
mobile sensors to offset the adversary and increase the deterrent value of our anti-
terrorism capabilities.

Question submitted by Representative Phil Gingrey
Q1. How  does  the  difference  in  structure  between  the  end-to-end,  research  to  oper-
ations, responsibilities of DNDO and the research-only management activities of
the  S&T  Directorate  affect  their  ability  to  provide  technologies  that  reflect  ma-
ture operational concepts and systems design?

A1. Improving  technology,  including  better  sensors  and  more  effective  forensics  ca-
pabilities, is a vital—perhaps the most vital—step toward defending against a covert
nuclear attack. To obtain this objective requires long-term, sustained research com-
mitments  across  the  Executive  Branch  and  better  use  of  the  national  labs,  among
other  measures.  While  the  lethality  of  a  nuclear  attack  on  the  homeland  is  known
among  experts  and  decision-makers,  a  strategic  approach  to  developing  advanced
sensing and detecting capabilities had become stove-piped and stultified in the Exec-
utive Branch prior to establishing the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office.

Acknowledging that the nuclear threat is different from most other threats posed
by  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  and  that  the  expensive  and  complicated  basic  re-
search needed to make progress is spread across several concerned agencies, includ-
ing DHS, DOD, DOE, and others, this information served as the foundation for cre-
ating  a  single  organization  to  draw  upon  existing  capabilities  and  support  develop-
ment and acquisition of needed capabilities. To accomplish this critical mission, that

new organization required an end-to-end process that spans the effort from research
to deployment.

Operations, however, were never presumed to be a part of the DNDO. To this day,
the  DNDO  remains  focused  on  research,  development,  and  acquisition  to  support
the originally stated mission of integrating and accelerating a better defense against
smuggled  nuclear  weapons.  Its  charter  stops  short  of  an  operational  role,  which
should continue to be the responsibility of relevant authorities such as Customs and
Border Protection and parts of the Defense and Energy Departments.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Marilyn  Ward,  Executive  Director,  National  Public  Safety  Tele-

communications Council (NPSTC)

Question submitted by Chairman David Wu
Q1. During the hearing, both Under Secretary Cohen and Director Oxford noted that
the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  and
Domestic Nuclear Detection Office have efforts underway to respond to the needs
of  first  responders.  From  the  perspective  of  NPSTC  and  its  members,  how  re-
sponsive  has  DNDO  been  to  criticism  of  the  high  cost  and  difficulty  of  use  of
its technologies?

A1. The National Public Safety Telecommunications Council is focused on the issues
of  public  safety  wireless  communications  and  inter-operability  and  does  not  closely
follow  or  monitor  the  efforts  of  the  Domestic  Nuclear  Detection  Office.  As  such,  I
cannot comment on the responsiveness of the DNDO or its technologies.

Question submitted by Representative Phil Gingrey
Q1. What  is  the  awareness  of  the  TechSolutions  website  within  the  first-responder
community?  Will  this  site  allow  first-responders  an  appropriate  level  of  access
to DHS research and development planning?

A1. To  the  best  of  my  knowledge,  I  am  unaware  that  the  National  Public  Safety
Telecommunications Council community is aware of the TechSolutions website.
