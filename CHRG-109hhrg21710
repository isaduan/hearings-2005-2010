HEARING CHARTER

SUBCOMMITTEE ON SPACE AND AERONAUTICS

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Live From Space:

The International Space Station

TUESDAY, JUNE 14, 2005

2:00 P.M.–4:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On  Tuesday,  June  14,  at  2:00  p.m.,  the  Committee  on  Science,  Subcommittee  on
Space  and  Aeronautics,  will  hold  a  hearing  via  satellite  with  National  Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) astronaut John Phillips, a member of the current
crew of the International Space Station (ISS). The other crew member on board ISS
is  Russian  Cosmonaut  Sergei  Krikalev,  the  Commander  of  Expedition  11,  who  will
not be participating in the hearing.

In  addition  to  Phillips  appearing  via  satellite,  there  will  be  two  astronauts  ap-
pearing in-person who have flown in space as part of the ISS program. The hearing
will  provide  Members  with  the  opportunity  to  interact  directly  with  those  who  are
operating and performing research on ISS.

This  is  the  first  hearing  in  Congressional  history  with  a  witness  testifying  from
space. It is possible because of advanced communications technology on ISS and sig-
nificant  preparation  and  coordination  by  NASA  and  the  Committee.  For  technical
reasons,  the  video  communication  link  will  only  be  available  for  a  limited  period  of
time, approximately 15 minutes.
Overarching Questions

The  hearing  will  review  the  current  activities  onboard  ISS,  accomplishments  of
the  crew,  status  of  current  research  on  the  Station,  and  observations  on  extended
human space flight, and explore the following overarching questions:

1. What  are  the  biggest  challenges  and  opportunities  of  living  and  working  on

ISS?

2. What  are  the  scientific  (research)  and  engineering  accomplishments  that

have resulted from operation of ISS?

Witnesses

The hearing will feature the following witnesses.1

Dr. John Phillips is a NASA astronaut and is currently living and working aboard
ISS as the Science Officer and Flight Engineer of Expedition 11.
Dr.  Peggy  Whitson  is  a  NASA  astronaut,  and  was  formerly  a  member  of  the  ISS
crew during Expedition 5 (June–Dec. 2002).
Lt. Col. Michael Fincke (USAF) is a NASA astronaut, and was formerly a mem-
ber of the ISS crew during Expedition 9 (April–Oct. 2004).

Background

In-orbit assembly of ISS began in 1998 with the launch of the first two segments:
the  Zarya  (‘‘Dawn’’)  module,  built  and  launched  by  Russia,  but  paid  for  by  NASA;
and  the  Unity  module,  built  by  NASA  and  launched  on  the  Space  Shuttle  in  late
1998.  In  total,  there  have  been  16  Shuttle  missions  to  ISS  (for  assembly,  logistics
and  utilization),  as  well  as  30  Russian  launches  to  ISS  (which  includes  three
launches  of  ISS  modules,  10  Soyuz  crew  launches  and  17  unmanned  Progress  re-
supply launches). In addition, astronauts have performed 58 spacewalks in conjunc-
tion  with  ISS  (25  Shuttle-based,  and  33  ISS-based),  totaling  more  than  348  hours.

1 Detailed biographies of the witnesses are included in Appendix A.

ISS  has  been  permanently  occupied  by  joint  U.S.-Russian  ‘‘Expedition’’  crews,  ro-
tating  on  four  to  six  month  shifts,  since  November  2000.  The  current  crew  is  the
11th rotation, or increment, and is thus designated Expedition 11.

The  United  States  is  building  ISS  in  partnership  with  Russia,  Canada,  Japan,
and  10  European  countries.  In  addition,  Brazil  has  a  bilateral  agreement  with
NASA  to  participate  in  the  program.  The  attached  diagram  illustrates  the  layout
of the various segments of ISS.

ISS assembly was approximately 50 percent complete (by mass) before the loss of
the  Space  Shuttle  Columbia  in  February  2003  halted  construction.  Because  the
Shuttle is the primary means of both assembly and re-supply for ISS, this has pre-
sented the ISS program with substantial challenges in conducting normal operations
for  the  past  two  years.  Without  Shuttle,  ISS  crews  have  relied  on  unmanned  Rus-
sian  Progress  vehicles  as  the  primary  means  for  re-supply  of  spare  parts  and
consumables  (water,  food,  etc.).  Additionally  the  Russian  Soyuz  vehicles  have  been
the  only  means  of  ferrying  crew  to  and  from  ISS.  (A  single  Soyuz  vehicle  is  always
docked  at  ISS  at  any  one  time  to  provide  the  crew  with  a  lifeboat  in  case  of  emer-
gency. Each Soyuz must be replaced every six months.)

Prior  to  the  Columbia  tragedy,  ISS  Expedition  crews  were  composed  of  three
members: two Russians and one American or one Russian and two Americans. After
Columbia, the crew size was reduced to two (one Russian and one American) to re-
duce the need for ISS to be re-supplied. The partners plan to restore the three-per-
son crew size this fall with the addition of a crew member who would be transported
to ISS on STS–121 (the second Shuttle mission after return-to-flight), scheduled for
later this year.

Despite  the  reduction  in  crew  size,  ISS  Expedition  crews  have  continued  to  con-
duct  research  while  the  Shuttle  is  grounded,  primarily  using  equipment  already
aboard  ISS.  (For  a  list  of  experiments  being  conducted  by  the  Expedition  11  crew,
see  Appendix  B.)  The  post-Columbia  accident  Expedition  crews  have  dealt  with  a
variety  of  equipment  failures,  such  as  repeated  shutdowns  of  the  Russian  oxygen
generating  device,  known  as  the  Elektron.  According  to  NASA,  there  are  sufficient
alternate  supplies  of  oxygen  aboard  ISS,  or  scheduled  to  be  delivered  by  re-supply
missions,  that  the  Elektron  failure  is  not  currently  a  safety  issue.  A  new  Elektron
unit is scheduled to be delivered to ISS later this summer.

There  have  also  been  failures  of  two  of  the  four  Control  Moment  Gyros  (CMGs)
that  help  keep  the  space  station  oriented  properly.  One  CMG  failed  permanently
and  is  scheduled  to  be  replaced  on  the  next  Shuttle  flight.  A  second  CMG  was  re-
paired by crews on spacewalks, but has failed again. NASA hopes to repair this sec-
ond unit on the next Shuttle flight as well. Only two CMGs are required to maintain
the Station’s proper orientation. If another were to fail, however, proper orientation
can  be  maintained  using  rocket  thrusters  on  one  of  the  Russian  modules.  In  order
to conserve rocket propellant, though, such an arrangement is not preferable.

NASA  also  is  currently  reformulating  its  scientific  research  program  for  ISS  in
light of President Bush’s directive that the research be focused on projects that sup-
port  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration.  In  addition  to  gaining  information  about
human  adaptation  to  weightlessness  that  may  be  needed  for  eventual  human  trips
to Mars, NASA Administrator Mike Griffin has cited the importance of the Station’s
potential role in testing hardware intended to go to the Moon or Mars. One example
could be closed-loop life support systems.
The Crew

NASA  astronaut  John  Phillips  currently  serves  as  Science  Officer  and  Flight
Engineer  for  ISS  Expedition  11.  Phillips  flew  aboard  the  Space  Shuttle  in  2001  on
STS–100,  logging  nearly  12  days  and  five  million  miles  in  space.  He  also  served  as
a  backup  crew  member  to  ISS  Expedition  7,  completing  that  assignment  in  Feb-
ruary 2003.

The  other  crew  member  on  board  ISS  is  Russian  Cosmonaut  Sergei  Krikalev,
the  Commander  of  Expedition  11,  who  will  not  be  participating  in  the  hearing.  As
commander, Krikalev is responsible for the overall safety and success of the mission.
Krikalev  is  a  veteran  of  five  previous  space  flights,  including  two  missions  to  the
Russian  space  station  Mir  and  two  Shuttle  flights.  He  was  a  member  of  the  first
ISS  crew  (Expedition  One),  serving  aboard  a  much  smaller  ISS  than  that  of  today,
from  Nov.  2,  2000,  to  March  18,  2001.  Before  Expedition  11,  he  had  spent  a  year,
five  months  and  10  days  in  space.  At  the  conclusion  of  this  mission,  he  will  be  the
world’s most experienced space traveler.
Expedition 11

Phillips and Krikalev are currently living and working aboard ISS on a six-month
tour  of  duty.  Expedition  11  was  launched  from  the  Baikonur  Cosmodrome  in

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 07:13 Dec 08, 2005 Jkt 021710 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA05\061405\21710 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

Kazakhstan  on  April  14,  2005  aboard  a  Russian  Soyuz,  which  docked  with  ISS  on
April 16, 2005.

Expedition 11 replaced Expedition 10, which was on ISS from October 2004 until
April 2005 (191 days). Expedition 11 is scheduled to return to Earth in October after
approximately 180 days on orbit. Plans call for Phillips and Krikalev to perform one
spacewalk. The astronauts will continue outfitting the exterior of ISS and work with
scientific experiments.

Phillips  and  Krikalev  will  also  welcome  the  arrival  of  two  Russian  Progress  un-
manned  supply  vehicles,  one  of  which  is  scheduled  for  launch  on  June  16  (and
should  reach  the  Station  on  June  18),  and  the  other  is  scheduled  for  launch  near
the end of August.

Highlights of the Expedition 11 crew’s mission are scheduled to include welcoming
the  return  of  Space  Shuttle  crews,  STS–114  (Discovery)  and  STS–121  (Atlantis),  if
the  current  Return-to-Flight  schedule  holds.  The  Shuttle  missions  will  deliver  sev-
eral tons of supplies and research equipment to ISS, and the Shuttle crews also are
expected  to  conduct  spacewalks.  As  noted,  STS–121  may  leave  a  third  astronaut
aboard ISS to serve as a long-duration crew member.
Questions for the Witnesses

The  witnesses  were  asked  to  address  the  following  questions  in  their  testimony:

Questions for Dr. John Phillips

In  your  testimony,  please  describe  (and,  to  the  extent  possible,  show  during  the
hearing) how you conduct a typical day on the International Space Station and what
are the greatest challenges, with specific attention to the following questions:

1. How have the loss of the Columbia Shuttle and the inability to use the Shut-
tle to re-supply the Station affected its operations during the last two years?
2. How do you deal with safety-related issues while on board ISS, such as tak-
ing  shelter  from  solar  flares,  maintaining  oxygen  supplies,  or  keeping  fit  to
reduce the bone loss associated with long-duration space flight?

3. What research does the crew of Expedition 11 plan to conduct while on board

the Station?

Questions for Dr. Peggy Whitson

In your testimony, please describe your most important accomplishments (both for
assembly  and  operations)  during  your  stay  on  the  International  Space  Station,  as
well  as  problems  you  may  have  experienced,  with  particular  emphasis  on  the  fol-
lowing questions:

1. What  are  the  challenges  of  performing  extravehicular  activity  (EVAs,  or
spacewalks)  from  the  Station?  What  can  EVAs  from  the  Station  teach  us
that we can apply to future Exploration-related activities?

2. What role does the micrometeoroid shielding you helped to install play in the

operation and maintenance of the Station?

3. What  impacts  did  your  stay  aboard  the  Station  have  on  your  health?  How
quickly  did  you  become  re-acclimated  to  Earth?  How  did  your  experience  in
that regard compare to that of other astronauts?

4. What  did  you  learn  about  the  psychological  dynamics  and  stresses  of  living
with  a  small  crew  in  space?  What  was  most  unexpected  about  your  experi-
ence?

Lt.  Col.  Michael  Fincke  was  added  to  the  witness  list  after  the  delivery  of  the
formal invitation letters, and thus did not receive questions to address for the hear-
ing.

Appendix A

Expedition 11 Crew Bio

John  Phillips  (Ph.D.),  ISS  Science  Officer  and  Flight  Engineer,  Expedition

11

John Phillips, 54, received a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and Rus-
sian from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1972 (where he graduated second in his class),
a  Master  of  Science  degree  in  aeronautical  systems  from  the  University  of  West
Florida  in  1974,  and  a  Master  of  Science  and  doctorate  in  geophysics  and  space
physics from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1984 and 1987 re-
spectively. He has been awarded the NASA Space Flight Medal and various military
awards.

Phillips  received  a  Navy  commission  upon  graduation  from  the  U.S.  Naval  Acad-
emy in 1972 and was designated a Naval Aviator in November 1974. He trained in
the  A–7  Corsair  Aircraft  at  Naval  Air  Station  Lemoore,  California  and  made  over-
seas deployment with Attack Squadron 155 aboard the USS Oriskany and USS Roo-
sevelt. Subsequent tours of duty included navy recruiting in Albany, New York, and
flying  the  CT–39  Sabreliner  Aircraft  at  Naval  Air  Station  North  Island,  California.
After leaving the Navy in 1982, Phillips enrolled as a graduate student at UCLA.
While at UCLA he carried out research involving observations by the NASA Pioneer
Venus Spacecraft. Upon completing his doctorate in 1987, he was awarded a J. Rob-
ert  Oppenheimer  Postdoctoral  Fellowship  at  Los  Alamos  National  Laboratory  in
New  Mexico.  He  accepted  a  career  position  at  Los  Alamos  in  1989.  While  there,
Phillips  performed  research  on  the  sun  and  the  space  environment.  From  1993
through  1996  he  was  Principal  Investigator  for  the  Solar  Wind  Plasma  Experiment
aboard  the  Ulysses  Spacecraft  as  it  executed  a  unique  trajectory  over  the  poles  of
the sun.

After  being  selected  as  an  astronaut  by  NASA  in  1996  and  completing  astronaut
candidate training, Phillips has held various jobs in the Astronaut Office, including
systems  engineering  and  as  International  Space  Station  Spacecraft  Communicator
(ISS CAPCOM).

In addition to his current space flight experience as Science Officer for ISS Expe-
dition  11,  Phillips  flew  aboard  Space  Shuttle  Endeavour  on  the  STS–100  mission
(April  19  to  May  1,  2001).  During  the  12-day,  187  orbit  mission,  the  Shuttle  crew
successfully delivered and installed the Canadarm-2 Robotic Arm on ISS. They also
delivered  experiments  and  supplies  aboard  the  Multi-Purpose  Logistics  Module
Raffaello  on  its  maiden  flight.  Phillips  was  the  Ascent/Entry  Flight  engineer  and
was  the  intravehicular  activity  coordinator  during  two  space  walks.  Phillips  also
served  as  a  backup  crew  member  to  ISS  Expedition  7,  completing  that  assignment
in February 2003.
Witnesses Appearing In-person

Peggy  Whitson  (Ph.D.),  NASA  Astronaut,  ISS  Science  Officer,  Expedition  5
Peggy  Whitson  received  a  Bachelor  of  Science  degree  in  biology/chemistry  from
Iowa  Wesleyan  College  in  1981,  and  a  doctorate  in  biochemistry  from  Rice  Univer-
sity  in  1985.  She  has  received  numerous  awards  and  honors,  including  the  NASA
Space  Flight  Medal,  and  the  Group  Achievement  Award  for  Shuttle-Mir  Program.
Dr. Whitson has also had two patents approved.

Upon  completion  of  her  graduate  work,  Whitson  continued  at  Rice  University  as
Postdoctoral  Fellow  until  October  1986,  at  which  point  she  began  her  studies  at
NASA Johnson Space Center, as a National Research Council Resident Research As-
sociate.

In  1992,  Whitson  was  named  the  Project  Scientist  of  the  Shuttle-Mir  Program
(STS–60, STS–63, STS–71, Mir 18, Mir 19) through 1995. From 1993–1996 she held
the  additional  responsibilities  of  the  Deputy  Division  Chief  of  the  Medical  Sciences
Division  at  NASA–JSC.  From  1995–1996  she  served  as  Co-Chair  of  the  U.S.–Rus-
sian Mission Science Working Group.

In  April  1996,  Whitson  was  selected  as  an  astronaut  candidate.  Upon  completing

Expedition 11 Science Overview

(The following section is adapted from the Expedition 11 press kit, available from:

http://www.shuttlepresskit.com/EXPEDITION11/index.htm)

Expedition  11—the  11th  long-duration  crew  on  ISS—began  in  April  2005,  when
the 11th crew arrived at the Station aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft. NASA ISS
Science  Officer  Phillips  and  Russian  Commander  Krikalev,  will  maintain  the  Sta-
tion and work with science teams on the ground to operate experiments and collect
data.

During  Expedition  11,  two  Russian  Progress  cargo  flights  are  scheduled  to  dock
with  ISS.  The  Progress  re-supply  ships  will  transport  supplies  to  the  Station  and
carry scientific equipment. Much of the research activities for Expedition 11 will be
carried  out  with  scientific  facilities  and  samples  already  on  board  ISS,  as  well  as
with  new  research  facilities  transported  by  the  next  two  Space  Shuttle  missions—
STS–114 scheduled for launch in July 2005, and STS–121 scheduled for launch later
in  2005.  Additional  experiments  are  being  evaluated  and  prepared  to  make  use  of
limited  cargo  space  on  the  Soyuz  or  Progress  vehicles.  The  research  agenda  for  the
expedition  remains  flexible.  While  most  equipment  and  samples  can  remain  on
board  the  Station  with  minimal  or  no  detrimental  effects,  a  few  perishable  sam-
ples—urine samples, for example—may be returned to Earth on the Soyuz.

The  Expedition  11  crew  has  more  than  100  hours  scheduled  for  U.S.  payload  ac-
tivities. Space Station science also will be conducted by remote ‘‘crewmembers’’—the
team of controllers and scientists on the ground, who will continue to plan, monitor
and  operate  experiments  from  control  centers  across  the  United  States.  A  team  of
controllers  for  Expedition  11  will  work  in  the  ISS  Payload  Operations  Center—
NASA’s  science  command  post  for  the  Space  Station—at  NASA’s  Marshall  Space
Flight  Center  Huntsville,  Ala.  Controllers  work  in  three  shifts  around  the  clock,
seven  days  a  week  in  the  Payload  Operations  Center,  which  links  researchers
around the world with their experiments and the crew aboard the Station.
EXPERIMENTS USING ON-BOARD RESOURCES

Many experiments from earlier Expeditions remain aboard the Space Station and
will continue to benefit from the long-term research platform provided by the orbit-
ing laboratory. These experiments include:
Crew Earth Observations (CEO) takes advantage of the crew in space to observe
and  photograph  natural  and  man-made  changes  on  Earth.  The  photographs  record
Earth  surface  changes  over  time,  as  well  as  more  fleeting  events  such  as  storms,
floods, fires and volcanic eruptions. Together they provide researchers on Earth with
vital, continuous images needed to better understand the planet.
Dust  Aerosol  Measurement  Feasibility  Test  (DAFT)  tests  the  ability  of  dif-
ferent  equipment  to  measure  the  levels  of  dust  and  air  quality  in  order  to  improve
fire detection capabilities in space.
Materials on the International Space Station Experiment (MISSE)  is  a  suit-
case-sized  experiment  attached  to  the  outside  of  the  Space  Station.  It  exposes  hun-
dreds of potential space construction materials to the environment. The samples will
be  returned  to  Earth  for  study  during  a  later  expedition.  Investigators  will  use  the
resulting data to design stronger, more durable spacecraft.
Protein  Crystal  Growth  Single-locker  Thermal  Enclosure  System  (PCG–
STES) will continue to process crystals that have been growing since Expedition 6,
launched in October 2002. Crystals that also were grown on Expeditions 2 beginning
in March 2001, as well as Expedition 4 launched in December 2001, and Expedition
5 beginning in June 2002, were returned to Earth for analysis. The facility provides
a  temperature-controlled  environment  for  growing  high-quality  protein  crystals  of
selected  proteins  in  microgravity  for  later  analyses  on  the  ground  to  determine  the
proteins’ molecular structure. Research may contribute to advances in medicine, ag-
riculture and other fields.
Space Acceleration Measurement System II (SAMS–II) and Microgravity Ac-
celeration Measurement System (MAMS) sensors measure vibrations caused by
crew, equipment and other sources that could disturb microgravity experiments.

HUMAN LIFE SCIENCE INVESTIGATIONS

Many  continuing  experiments  will  use  measurements  of  Expedition  11  crew-
members to study changes in the body caused by exposure to the microgravity envi-
ronment.
Chromosomal  Aberrations  in  Blood  Lymphocytes  of  Astronauts  (Chro-
mosome),  will  study  space  radiation  on  humans.  The  expected  results  will  provide
a  better  knowledge  of  the  genetic  risk  of  astronauts  in  space  and  can  help  to  opti-
mize radiation shielding.
Promoting  Sensorimotor  Response  to  Generalizability:  A  Countermeasure
to Mitigate Locomotor Dysfunction After Long-duration Spaceflight (Mobil-
ity)  studies  changes  in  posture  and  gait  after  long-duration  space  flight.  Study  re-
sults are expected to help in the development of an in-flight treadmill training pro-
gram for Station crew members that could facilitate rapid recovery of functional mo-
bility after long duration space flight.
Behavioral  Issues  Associated  with  Isolation  and  Confinement:  Review  and
Analysis  of  Astronaut  Journals  collects  behavioral  and  human  factors  data  for
analysis,  with  the  intention  of  furthering  our  understanding  of  life  in  isolation  and
confinement.  The  objective  of  the  experiment  is  to  identify  equipment,  habitat  and
procedural  features  that  help  humans  adjust  to  isolation  and  confinement  and  re-
main effective and productive during future long-duration space expeditions.
Advanced  Diagnostic  Ultrasound  in  Microgravity  (ADUM)  involves  crew
members  conducting  ultrasound  exams  on  one  another  with  minimal  training  and
with  direction  from  a  ground  based  sonographer.  Verification  of  these  advanced
ultrasound  techniques  and  telemedicine  strategies  could  have  widespread  applica-
tions in emergency and rural care situations on Earth.
The  Biopsy  experiment  allows  researchers  to  take  biopsies  of  the  astronauts’  calf
muscles  before  and  after  their  stay  on  board  the  Space  Station.  This  will  allow  sci-
entists  to  begin  developing  an  in-space  countermeasure  exercise  program  aimed  at
keeping muscles at their peak performance during long missions in space.
Foot/Ground Reaction Forces During Space Flight (Foot) studies  the  load  on
the  lower  body  and  muscle  activity  in  crew  members  while  working  on  the  Station.
This  study  will  provide  better  understanding  of  the  bone  and  muscle  loss  in  the
lower extremities experienced by astronauts in microgravity. The results of this ex-
periment  will  help  in  future  space  flights,  as  well  as  have  significance  for  under-
standing, preventing and treating osteoporosis on Earth.
The Renal Stone experiment collects urine samples from the crew and tests a pos-
sible countermeasure for preventing kidney stone formation.
A  Comprehensive  Characterization  of  Microorganisms  and  Allergens  in
Spacecraft  (Swab)  will  use  generic  techniques  for  the  first  time  to  comprehen-
sively  evaluate  microbes  on  board  the  Space  Station,  including  pathogens,  and  to
study  how  the  microbial  community  changes  as  spacecraft  visit  the  Space  Station
and modules are added. This study will monitor Station modules prior to launch to
evaluate sources of new germs and find ways of preventing additional contamination
onboard spacecraft.
Space  Flight-Induced  Reactivation  of  Latent  Epstein-Barr  Virus  (Epstein-
Barr) performs  tests  to  study  changes  in  human  immune  function  using  blood  and
urine samples collected before and after space flight. The study will provide insight
for  possible  countermeasures  to  prevent  the  potential  development  of  infectious  ill-
ness in crew members during flight.

DESTINY LABORATORY FACILITIES

Several  research  facilities  are  in  place  aboard  the  Station  to  support  Expedition

11 science investigations:
The  Human  Research  Facility  is  designed  to  house  and  support  a  variety  of  life
sciences  experiments.  It  includes  equipment  for  lung  function  tests,  ultrasound  to
image the heart and many other types of computers and medical equipment.
The  Microgravity Science Glovebox is  the  other  major  dedicated  science  facility
inside  Destiny.  It  has  a  large  front  window  and  built-in  gloves  to  provide  a  sealed
environment  for  conducting  science  and  technology  experiments.  The  Glovebox  is
particularly  suited  for  handling  hazardous  materials  when  a  crew  is  present.  The
Destiny  lab  also  is  outfitted  with  five  EXPRESS  Racks.  EXPRESS  (Expedite  the
Processing  of  Experiments  to  the  Space  Station)  racks  are  standard  payload  racks

designed to provide experiments with a variety of utilities such as power, data, cool-
ing, fluids and gasses. The racks support payloads in a several disciplines, including
biology, chemistry, physics, ecology and medicines. The racks stay in orbit, while ex-
periments  are  changed  as  needed.  EXPRESS  Racks  2  and  3  are  equipped  with  the
Active  Rack  Isolation  System  (ARIS)  for  countering  minute  vibrations  from  crew
movement or operating equipment that could disturb delicate experiments.

Chairman  CALVERT.  I  call  this  meeting  of  the  Space  and  Aero-

nautics Subcommittee to order.

Without  objection,  the  Chair  will  be  granted  authority  to  recess

the Committee.

Today,  we  are  going  to  have  a  special  experience.  We  are  going
from  Capitol  Hill  ‘‘Live  to  Space  Aboard  the  International  Space
Station.’’  We  will  be  talking  to  Dr.  John  Phillips,  the  current  U.S.
astronaut  on  the  Space  Station.  From  his  current  abode  in  low-
Earth orbit, 218 miles above the Earth, Dr. Phillips will be answer-
ing  some  of  our  questions  about  what  it  is  really  like  to  live  in
space. This is the first hearing in Congressional history with a wit-
ness testifying from space.

Our goal today is to hear first hand from the astronauts what it
is like to live and work in space. We will hear directly from the as-
tronauts  on  how  they  are  dealing  with  the  challenges  of  operating
and  maintaining  the  International  Space  Station  as  well  as  hear
about  the  research  they  are  conducting.  This  hearing  gives  us  a
chance  to  learn  about  what  is  really  going  on  in  space  from  those
directly  involved,  rather  than  delve  into  the  programmatic  and
budgetary details of the ISS program.

Members, you will notice that you have information in your pack-
ets  on  special  considerations  in  communicating  with  Dr.  Phillips
and  today’s  hearing  schedule.  The  other  ISS  crewmember  who  is
currently  on  board  is  Cosmonaut  Sergei  Krikalev,  the  Commander
of  Expedition  11,  will  not  be  participating  in  the  hearing.  We  also
have  two  astronauts  who  have  joined  us,  each  of  whom  have  lived
on the ISS previously. First is Dr. Peggy Whitson, who was on the
ISS  on  Expedition  5  from  June  through  December  of  2002.  Our
final  witness  is  Lieutenant  Colonel  Mike  Fincke,  who  was  a  mem-
ber of Expedition 9 from April through October of 2004.

We  are  going  to  have  a  very—we  will  be  very  brief  in  today’s
opening  statements,  so  that  when  we  get  the  connection  with  the
International Space Station we can move right on to the questions.
Dr. Peggy Whitson has agreed to deliver the opening statement on
behalf  of  the  three  astronauts,  giving  us  more  time  for  questions
for  each  of  the  astronauts.  Keep  in  mind  that  our  connection  with
International  Space  Station  is  a  total  of  only  15  minutes.  So  in-
stead  of  the  usual  five  minutes  for  each  member,  we  are  going  to
give  each  member  only  two  minutes,  which  I  will  strictly  enforce
to  be  fair  for  everyone.  If  we  have  time,  we  will  go  back  around
again.  That  means  you  have  two  minutes  totally  for  the  question
and the answer.

Although we will be able to see Dr. Phillips on the International
Space  Station,  he  will  be  unable  to  see  us,  so  I  ask  that  when  you
ask  your  questions,  please  identify  yourself.  There  will  be  a  trans-
mission delay, so please wait about a second after you turn on your
microphone before beginning to speak. There is also about a three-
second transmission delay before Dr. Phillips will hear you and will
respond.  Be  sure  to  speak  clearly  into  the  microphone.  Again,
please  ask  only  one  question  to  Dr.  Phillips  in  order  to  accommo-
date  everyone.  When  we  lose  the  connection  to  the  International
Space Station after 15 minutes, members will have an opportunity
to  ask  questions  with  the  standard  five-minute  rule  of  our  two
former ISS astronauts that we have here with us today.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN KEN CALVERT

Today, we are going to have a special experience. We are going from Capitol Hill
Live  to  Space  Aboard  the  International  Space  Station.  We  will  be  talking  with  Dr.
John  Phillips,  the  current  U.  S.  astronaut  on  the  Space  Station.  From  his  current
abode in Low-Earth Orbit, 218 miles above the Earth, Dr. Phillips will answer some
of our questions about what it is really like to live in space. This is the first hearing
in Congressional history with a witness testifying from space.

The  International  Space  Station  (ISS)  has  been  permanently  occupied  by  joint
U.S.–Russian ‘‘Expedition’’ crews since November 2000. Dr. Phillips is a member of
the  11th  Expedition.  ISS  is  approximately  50  percent  complete  and  we  are  waiting
to  see  what  NASA  plans  to  do  for  the  final  assembly  complete.  Since  the  Columbia
accident,  the  Russian  Soyuz  has  been  the  means  to  ferry  crew,  and  the  Russian
Progress  launch  vehicle  has  been  the  means  for  re-supply  of  spare  parts  and
consumables.  Prior  to  the  Columbia  tragedy,  the  ISS  Expedition  crews  were  com-
posed of three members—two Russians and one American or two Americans and one
Russian.

After  Columbia,  crew  size  was  reduced  to  two  persons—one  American  and  one
Russian.  Despite  this  reduction  in  crew  size,  ISS  Expedition  crews  have  continued
to  conduct  research  while  the  Shuttle  is  grounded,  primarily  using  the  equipment
that  is  already  aboard.  NASA  will  be  reconfiguring  the  scientific  research  program
for  the  ISS  to  focus  on  projects  that  support  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration.  The
ISS  will  be  a  great  platform  to  study  humans  and  their  potential  adaptation  to
weightlessness  as  well  as  for  testing  hardware  intended  to  go  to  the  Moon  or  other
destinations.

Members,  you  will  notice  that  you  have  information  in  your  packets  on  special
considerations  in  communicating  with  Dr.  Phillips  and  today’s  hearing  schedule.
The  other  ISS  crew  member  who  is  currently  on  board  is  Cosmonaut  Sergei
Krikalev,  (pronounced  sir-gay  kree-ka-loff)  the  Commander  of  Expedition  11,  who
will  not  be  participating  in  the  hearing.  We  also  have  two  astronauts  who  have
joined  us—each  of  whom  has  lived  on  the  ISS  previously.  The  first  is  Dr.  Peggy
Whitson  who  was  on  the  ISS  on  Expedition  5  from  June  through  December  2002.
Our  final  witness  is  Air  Force  Lt.  Col.  Michael  Fincke  (USAF)  (pronounced  fink)
who was a member of Expedition 9 from April through October 2004.

We are going to be very brief in today’s opening statements, so that when we get
the connection with the ISS, we can move right on to questions. Dr. Peggy Whitson
has  agreed  to  deliver  the  opening  statement  on  behalf  of  the  three  astronauts,  giv-
ing  us  more  time  for  questions  for  each  of  the  astronauts.  Keep  in  mind  that  our
connection  with  the  ISS  a  total  of  only  15  minutes  to  the  ISS.  So  instead  of  the
usual  five  minutes  for  each  Member,  we  are  going  to  give  each  Member  only  two
minutes, which I will strictly enforce to be fair to everyone.

Although  we  will  be  able  to  see  Dr.  Phillips  on  the  ISS,  he  will  be  unable  to  see
us,  so  I  ask  that  when  you  ask  your  questions,  please  identify  yourself.  There  will
be a transmission delay, so please wait about a second after you turn on your micro-
phone  before  beginning  to  speak.  There  is  also  about  a  three  second  transmission
delay  before  Dr.  Phillips  will  hear  you  and  will  respond.  Be  sure  to  speak  clearly
into  the  microphone.  Again,  please  ask  only  one  question  to  Dr.  Phillips  in  order
to  accommodate  everyone.  When  we  lose  the  connection  to  the  ISS  in  15  minutes,
Members  will  have  an  opportunity  to  ask  questions  with  the  standard  five-minute
rule of our two former ISS astronauts that we have here with us today.

Chairman  CALVERT.  And  with  that,  Mr.  Udall,  you  may  begin

your opening statement.

Mr. UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  want  to  join  the  Chairman  in  welcoming  today’s  witnesses,  es-
pecially  Dr.  John  Phillips,  who  will  be  with  us  from  the  Inter-
national  Space  Station.  I  would  also  like  to  take  a  moment  to  ex-
press  my  personal  appreciation  to  our  witnesses,  and  to  all  of  the
astronaut corps for the service that you render to our nation.

Human  space  exploration  involves  risk,  yet  it  is  an  undertaking
that  I  and  you,  obviously,  believe  is  important  to  the  future  of  our
nation.  You  have  been  willing  to  accept  the  risk,  because  you  also
believe in the importance of human space exploration.

Fundamentally,  NASA’s  science  and  exploration  programs  are
about pushing back the boundaries of our ignorance. And, properly
utilized,  that  is  what  I  believe  that  we  can  do  with  the  Inter-
national  Space  Station,  push  back  the  boundaries  of  our  ignorance
across a range of scientific and technological disciplines.

The advances we make on the ISS have the potential to prepare
us  for  the  challenging  human  missions  beyond  low-Earth  orbit.
They  also  have  the  potential  to  benefit  life  back  here  on  Earth  if
we  are  willing  to  invest  in  the  necessary  fundamental  and  applied
research.

To that end, I would hope that as NASA contemplates a restruc-
turing  of  the  ISS  research  program,  it  does  not  unduly  narrow  its
focus. We have spent too much time to build the Space Station not
to  try  to  make  optimal  use  of  its  capabilities.  However,  that  is  an
issue for another day.

At  today’s  hearing,  I  look  forward  to  learning  more  about  what
it  is  like  to  actually  live  and  work  in  space.  And  I  would  also  like
to  learn  more  about  how  the  astronauts  on  the  Station  are  coping
with the impact of the Shuttle fleet’s grounding.

Mr.  Chairman,  today’s  hearing  should  be  fascinating.  I  want  to
thank you for holding it, and I look forward to the testimony of our
witnesses.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MARK UDALL

Good  afternoon.  I  want  to  join  the  Chairman  in  welcoming  the  witnesses  to  to-
day’s  hearing—especially  Dr.  John  Phillips,  who  will  be  talking  to  us  live  from  the
International  Space  Station.  And  I’d  also  like  to  take  a  moment  to  express  my  per-
sonal appreciation to our witnesses—and to all of the astronaut corps—for the serv-

build the Space Station not to try to make optimal use of its capabilities. However,
that is an issue for another day.

At  today’s  hearing,  I  look  forward  to  learning  more  about  what  it  is  actually  like
to  live  and  work  in  space.  I’d  also  like  to  learn  more  about  how  the  astronauts  on
the ISS are coping with the impact of the Shuttle fleet’s grounding.

Mr.  Chairman,  today’s  hearing  should  be  fascinating.  I  want  to  thank  you  for

holding it, and I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses. Thank you.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman for his testimony.
Without  objection,  the  additional  statements  of  other  Members
will be put into the written record, so we can get right to the ques-
tions. Hearing no objection, so ordered.

I am honored to be here today for this historic Subcommittee hearing with Amer-
ican  astronauts  who  have  been  on  the  International  Space  Station.  I  want  to  wel-
come our distinguished panel of witnesses to the Subcommittee on Space and Aero-
nautics.  Indeed,  we  have  a  unique  opportunity  to  interact  with  Dr.  John  Phillips
who will be testifying live from the ISS; the first time in history such testimony has
taken place.

While  I  appreciate  the  Chairman  and  Ranking  Member  of  this  subcommittee  for
organizing  this  hearing,  I  would  be  remiss  if  I  did  not  reiterate  my  belief  that  we
need  to  hold  a  hearing  on  safety.  After  the  tragic  Columbia  Space  Shuttle  accident
safety has been the number one priority of this subcommittee. I believe there should
be  a  safety  hearing  not  only  for  our  Space  Shuttle  which  is  returning  to  flight,  but
also for safety on-board the ISS.

I  have  long  been  a  supporter  of  the  ISS  and  its  mission.  Indeed,  this  mission  is
unique  among  other  space  exploration  missions  because  of  the  cooperation  between
nations.  The  ISS  is  truly  an  international  program  with  the  original  partnership
being established in 1988 including the U.S., Japan, and the European Space Agen-
cy.  Russia  was  later  invited  to  joint  the  partnership  in  1993,  and  revised  inter-
national  agreements  governing  the  program  were  signed  in  1998.  Since  that  time,
the  ISS  has  pushed  the  boundaries  of  what  had  been  previously  achieved  in  space.
The first ISS modules were launched in 1998 and astronauts began continuous occu-
pation  of  the  ISS  in  November  2000.  At  the  start  permanent  crews  consisted  of
three  astronauts,  however,  since  the  tragic  Columbia  Space  Shuttle  accident
grounded  the  Shuttle  fleet  in  2003,  crew  size  has  been  limited  to  only  two  astro-
nauts.

Because  of  the  current  limitations  of  our  Space  Shuttle  program  and  that  of  the
Russian space program, the ISS has undergone some recent challenges in maintain-
ing safe and sustained operations. In fact recently the Russian Elektron oxygen gen-
erator has been having repeated problems. Water and food have also been carefully
rationed.  In  late  2004,  the  Expedition  10  crew  had  to  limit  its  food  intake  due  to
shortages  on-board  the  ISS.  These  problems  are  being  addressed  but  they  only  un-
derscore the fact that safety on-board the ISS must be more closely scrutinized.

At this time the ISS assembly is scheduled to be completed around 2010, but little
is certain as far as a timetable as NASA is currently reviewing the assembly sched-
ule  and  content.  As  I  stated,  I  am  a  strong  supporter  of  the  ISS  and  hope  that  we
can  move  forward  with  its  mission.  However,  our  mission  for  discovery  can  not  be
done  in  haste;  instead  we  must  ensure  that  all  steps  have  been  taken  to  minimize
the risk to astronauts on-board.

Chairman  CALVERT.  I  also  ask  unanimous  consent  to  insert  at
the  appropriate  place  in  the  record,  the  background  memorandum
prepared  by  the  Majority  staff  for  this  hearing.  Hearing  no  objec-
tion, so ordered.

Today, we will begin our hearing with testimony from Dr. Peggy
Whitson,  a  NASA  astronaut  who  was  formerly  a  member  of  the
International  Space  Station  crew  during  the  Expedition  5  from
June to December of 2002, as I mentioned earlier. If we have time
before we are connected to the International Space Station, we can
allow  a  couple  of  brief  questions  of  Dr.  Whitson  and  to  Lieutenant
Colonel Michael Fincke sitting at the witness table. However, once
we begin the connection to International Space Station, we will im-
mediately  move  to  the  two-minute  rounds  of  questions  to  Dr.  Phil-
lips.  Once  we  lose  the  connection,  we  will  resume  the  questions  to
Dr. Whitson and Lieutenant Colonel Fincke.

And  with  that,  Dr.  Whitson,  you  may  begin  your  opening  state-

ment.
STATEMENT  OF  DR.  PEGGY  A.  WHITSON,  NASA  ASTRONAUT,
SCIENCE OFFICER AND FLIGHT ENGINEER, ISS EXPEDITION
5 (JUNE–DECEMBER 2002)
Dr.  WHITSON.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee,  it  is  a  real  honor  for  us  to  be  here  today  to  testify  about
the  International  Space  Station.  As  mentioned,  I  am  here  with

Lieutenant  Colonel  Mike  Fincke.  He  was  Flight  Engineer  and
Science Officer on board during Expedition 9, and Dr. John Phillips
is  serving  in  that  same  role  on  board  the  International  Space  Sta-
tion right now.

I  thought  I  would  start  off  with  just  a  few  comments  about  my
experience  on  board  the  International  Space  Station  and  give  you
a  big  picture  of  where  John  and  Sergei’s  mission  is  on  orbit  and
what we plan on as part of the next six months of their stay.

As  a  scientist,  it  was  really  exciting  for  me  to  be  the  on-orbit
hands  of  the  investigators  on  the  ground.  And  as  uniquely,  prob-
ably,  or  nearly  uniquely,  as  the  daughter  of  a  farmer,  it  was  also
a  very  exciting  thing  to  do  a  soybean,  commercial  soybean  plant
growth experiment while on board the International Space Station.
I  think  my  dad  had  a  greater  yield  of  soybeans  than  I  did,  but  it
was still a lot of fun to compare stories.

We also got—I also got to participate in another experiment that
I am a principle investigator on looking at the efficacy of potassium
citrate  and  reducing  the  kidney  stone-forming  potential  in  astro-
nauts. Because of the bone demineralization process that occurs on
orbit, there is a greater risk of kidney stones forming. And actually,
we  are  continuing  that  experiment,  and  John  and  Sergei  on  orbit
are my next subjects, and they will be continuing that experiment.
My  background  in  human  life  sciences  really  gave  me  a  unique
opportunity to know in advance of my space flight all of the things
that  might—I  might  experience  when  I  went  into  zero  gravity  and
actually returning back to Earth, but I would have to say that even
I  was  surprised  by  how  much  a  neuro-vestibular  imbalance  I  felt
upon  returning  to  Earth.  As  you  know,  the  International  Space
Station  is  orbiting  at  17,500  miles  per  hour,  and  when  I  returned
to  Earth,  I  felt  like  the  Earth  was  orbiting  around  me  at  approxi-
mately 17,500 miles per hour. Luckily, that recovery was relatively
quick, and within a day or so, I had recovered from that particular
effect of being at zero gravity for a six-month period.

I  am  sure  John  is  going  to  be  really  happy  to  share  his  experi-
ence  on  board  the  International  Space  Station  with  you  and  some
of  his  science  background  that  he  is  working  on  up  there.  In  addi-
tion  to  the  science  activities  they  are  doing,  John  and  Sergei  are
doing a space walk to set up some experiments externally. They are
also going to be performing a number of maintenance tests, routine
maintenance tests. They will be greeting two progress resupply ve-
hicles.  These  are  Russian  resupply  vehicles.  One  is  actually  arriv-
ing to the International Space Station later this week.

And then, of course, we are very excited about the arrival of the
Discovery  with  Eileen  Collins  and  her  six  crew  members  on  the
Shuttle  return  to  flight.  So  they  will  be  on  board  during  that  mis-
sion  as  well.  During  that  time,  during  the  docked  phase  of  that
Shuttle  mission,  they  will  do—perform  three  space  walks  and
transfer, literally, tons of hardware to and from the Station.

The  Expedition  11  crew  has  more  than  100  hours  of  science  and
payload activities planned. In addition to being the subjects for my
experiment,  they  are  also  doing  a  number  of  different  activities
looking  at  the  human  physiology  and  the  effects  of  long  duration
and  being  in  space.  And  one  of  the  more  interesting  studies  that,
actually, Mike and I both participated in and is being continued is

developing  the  techniques  using  ultrasound  by  non-experienced
crew  members  or  untrained  professionals  to  do  ultrasounds  in  a
very  complex  manner.  And  actually,  that  is  something  that  can
apply  to  us  here  on  Earth  as  well  in  real  medicine  scenarios  or
even on battlefields. So we are excited about that research as well.
In  summary,  I  just  wanted  to  say  that  the  International  Space
Station is an incredible engineering feat, and our studies to under-
stand how the human body responds to that and our understanding
of all of the complications and problems that arise as a part of op-
erating this Station is going to help us prepare for the longer dura-
tion missions to the Moon and Mars and beyond.

And  Mike  and  I  are  really  excited  about  taking  any  questions
you  might  have,  and  we  will  get  a  signal  here  in  a  little  bit  about
when we can start talking to John.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Whitson follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF PEGGY A. WHITSON

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity
to appear before you today. I consider it an honor to appear here with Mike Fincke,
who  was  the  Science  Officer  on  Expedition  9.  In  just  a  few  minutes,  John  Phillips,
Expedition  11  Flight  Engineer  and  Science  Officer,  will  be  appearing  live,  via  sat-
ellite, from the ISS to answer questions about life on orbit. First, I’d like to tell you
a little about my experience on the Station as part of Expedition 5 and then provide
you with an overview of current activities aboard the Station.
Life and Work Aboard the International Space Station

In  the  over  four  years  of  continuous  human  presence  on  board  the  ISS,  we  have
performed important science that will allow us to expand our presence into the solar
system. We have discovered things that make our life here on Earth better. We have
learned  about  technologies  and  processes  which  will  help  us  meet  the  challenges  of
future exploration.

While  we  can  to  some  extent  simulate  living  conditions  in  space  here  on  the
ground, there is no substitute for experience in the actual space environment. Sim-
ply  put,  to  learn  how  to  live  in  space,  we  must  live  in  space.  Every  experiment,
every  space  walk,  every  repair  and  every  piece  of  hardware  assembled  teaches  us
something new. A full time human presence aboard the ISS offers us a tremendous
opportunity to study human survival in the hostile environment of space and assess
how to overcome the technological hurdles to human exploration beyond Earth orbit,
as called for in the Vision for Space Exploration.

During my time on Station (Expedition 5), we hosted three Shuttle assembly mis-
sions.  Using  the  Station’s  robotic  arm,  we  installed  the  S1  (starboard  1)  and  P1
(port  1)  truss  elements  and  the  Mobile  Base  System,  which  serves  as  the  platform
for transporting the robotic arm and any attached hardware or experiments to var-
ious locations along the truss.

We  also  performed  two  extra-vehicular  activities  (EVA).  Space  walks  are  a  phys-
ical challenge, since we work in a pressurized suit that protects us from the vacuum
of space, but requires us to perform hand-intensive tasks working against this pres-
sure.  EVAs  are  also  an  operational  challenge,  especially  now  while  we  have  only
two-person  crews,  since  both  crew  members  are  outside.  From  these  activities  we
continue to learn a great deal about assembly of Station elements, repair of external
components, operational processes, and spacesuit capabilities.

As  a  scientist,  it  was,  of  course,  exciting  being  the  on  orbit  hands  of  the  investi-
gator  teams  on  the  ground.  Being  the  daughter  of  a  farmer,  I  would  have  to  say
that the commercial experiment involving soybean growth was very, very special to
me  as  well.  I  also  had  the  unique  opportunity  to  be  the  principal  investigator  and
the  subject  for  my  own  experiment  to  test  potassium  citrate  ingestion  as  a  mecha-
nism  to  reduce  the  kidney  stone-forming  potential  in  space  travelers.  In  fact,  I  am
still working on this experiment, albeit from the ground, with Expedition 11 as our
primary  subjects.  A  few  of  the  other  experiments  we  conducted  on  Expedition  5  in-
cluded:  super-conducting  crystal  materials  with  different  technical  additives  and  in
different heating profiles to better assess the crystallization characteristics in an en-
vironment where gravity is not a variable, assessing pulmonary lung function before
and after EVA, and developing procedures for diagnostic ultrasound capability.

My background in the human space life sciences provided me with a lot of insight
into  the  potential  physiologic  responses  that  a  crew  member  might  anticipate  upon
entering and returning from microgravity. However, I was still surprised by the low
back pain as my spinal column relaxed, and the surrounding muscles stretched out
on  flight  day  four  and  five.  Although  individual  crew  responses  can  vary  dramati-
cally,  I  was  also  surprised  by  the  neuro-vestibular  imbalance  I  felt  upon  returning
to  Earth’s  gravity  after  six  months  on  orbit.  For  the  first  24  hours,  I  felt  like  the
world was spinning around me; as if I were still on orbit, and I thought they should
just send me back to the Station. Luckily for me, recovery was relatively quick after
that first day.

As a result of a very intensive exercise regime, I lost no overall bone density. This
is very promising for us in the development of exercise programs for extended explo-
ration missions to Mars when we will need to have an exercise and/or pharmacologic
plan to minimize the impacts of extended periods in microgravity.

We  typically  train  prior  to  flight  for  three  or  more  years.  Much  of  that  time  is
spent with crew mates in classroom training and simulations. I consider this a very
important time to learn not only about us, but the best way to constructively inter-
act with our crew mates and our ground support teams. The loss of Columbia meant
that  we  had  to  reduce  the  Station  crew  size  to  two.  As  a  result,  our  crews  and
ground  teams  have  come  up  with  creative  new  methods  to  squeeze  in  more  work
and provide better support. Although I had great respect for the work conducted by
the ground team even before I flew, I was surprised by how close I felt to them dur-
ing  my  mission.  As  Mike  and  John  can  tell  you,  the  ground  crew  acts  as  a  ‘‘third’’
crew member for our two-person crews by helping them with everything from moni-
toring the Station to assisting with research.

Safety is something we all take as a fundamental value in how we build and oper-
ate  the  Station.  An  intensive  system  safety  engineering  effort  during  the  develop-
ment and manufacture of the International Space Station system has mitigated the
known hazards presented by living in low-Earth orbit. For example, we have design
features, such as the Micro Meteoroid Orbital Debris (MMOD) shields on the Service
Module  to  reduce  the  chance  that  orbital  debris  will  penetrate  the  Station.  In  fact,
more of these panels will be installed in the future to even further reduce this prob-
ability.  We  have  a  caution  and  warning  system  installed  to  alert  the  crew  to  any
impending dangers, such as fire or pressure leaks that may raise the risk of injury,
we have emergency equipment on the Station such as fire suppression to reduce the
consequence  of  fire,  and  we  have  a  ‘‘lifeboat,’’  the  Soyuz  crew  return  vehicle,  which
we can use as a last resort if we have to abandon the Station should the living con-
ditions  become  untenable.  Ground-based  and  on-orbit  safety-related  training  are  a
large  part  of  our  pre-mission  preparation  and  during  the  mission.  In  addition,  the
ground  team  also  plays  a  large  role  in  ensuring  the  safety  of  the  Station  and  the
crew  by  providing  maintenance  procedures  for  both  critical  as  well  as  non-critical
equipment, by providing real-time information and pre-cautions for events like solar
flares or by providing feedback on exercise regimes.
Expedition 11 Mission

In  April,  we  sent  a  new  crew  to  live  on  the  International  Space  Station.  Flight
Engineer  John  Phillips  and  Station  Commander  Sergei  Krikalev  will  perform  one
space walk, a number of experiments, and daily maintenance during their six-month
stay. They will greet two Russian Progress resupply vehicles, including one that ar-
rives  this  week,  and  at  least  one  U.S.  Space  Shuttle  flight.  They  will  also  relocate
their Soyuz spacecraft from the Pirs docking port to the Zarya docking port in order
to free up the Pirs airlock to support the space walk.

During the space walk from the Russian Pirs airlock in September, the crew will

relocate and recover Russian science equipment.

Expedition  11  will  be  on  board  the  Station  when  Commander  Eileen  Collins  and
her  six  crew  members  launch  on  the  Space  Shuttle  Discovery  on  the  first  post-Co-
lumbia mission. It will mark the first time since the STS–113 mission in November
2002 that a Space Shuttle will arrive at the Station. The two crews plan eight days
of  joint  docked  operations,  including  the  resupply  of  the  Station  with  several  tons
of  food  and  equipment,  as  well  as  three  space  walks  out  of  the  Shuttle’s  airlock  by
Discovery astronauts.
Expedition 11 Science

Much of the research activities for Expedition 11 will be carried out with scientific
facilities  and  samples  already  on  board  the  Space  Station,  as  well  as  with  new  re-
search  facilities  transported  by  the  next  two  Space  Shuttle  missions.  While  most
equipment and samples can remain on board the Station with minimal or no detri-
mental  effects,  a  few  perishable  samples  will  be  returned  to  Earth  on  the  Soyuz.

The  Expedition  11  crew  has  more  than  100  hours  scheduled  for  U.S.  payload  ac-
tivities.  In  addition  to  the  crew  on  the  Station,  a  team  of  controllers  for  Expedition
11  will  work  in  the  Space  Station’s  Payload  Operations  Center—NASA’s  science
command  post  for  the  Space  Station  at  NASA’s  Marshall  Space  Flight  Center  in
Huntsville,  Alabama.  Controllers  link  researchers  around  the  world  with  their  ex-
periments and the crew aboard the Station.

Other experiments to be conducted by Expedition 11 include:

• Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity (ADUM):

Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity (ADUM) will be used to de-
termine the ability of minimally trained Station crew members to perform ad-
vanced  ultrasound  examinations  after  using  a  computer-based  training  pro-
gram. Verification of these advanced ultrasound techniques and telemedicine
strategies  could  have  widespread  applications  in  emergency  and  rural  care
situations  on  Earth.  The  ADUM  experiment,  which  uses  remote  guidance
methodologies,  has  been  conducted  during  Expeditions  8,  9  and  10  and  is
scheduled for completion with the Increment 11 crew.

• Foot/Ground Reaction Forces During Space Flight (FOOT):

FOOT  studies  the  load  on  the  lower  body  and  muscle  activity  in  crew  mem-
bers  while  working  on  the  Station.  Previous  portions  of  this  study  on  earlier
increments  have  provided  better  understanding  of  the  bone  and  muscle  loss
in  the  lower  extremities  experienced  by  astronauts  in  microgravity.  The  re-
sults  of  this  experiment  will  help  in  future  space  flights,  as  well  as  poten-
tially improve our understanding to prevent and treat osteoporosis.

• Dust and Aerosol Measurement Feasibility Test (DAFT):

DAFT  releases  particles  in  the  Space  Station  atmosphere  to  test  the  ability
of  different  equipment  to  measure  the  levels  of  dust  and  air  quality.  It  will
help to improve air quality and fire detection in space.

• Hand Posture Analyzer (HPA):

HPA  will  investigate  the  performance  degradation  of  the  human  upper  limb
muscle-skeletal apparatus and its morphological-functional modifications dur-
ing  long-term  exposure  to  weightlessness  and  to  study  the  role  of  gravity  in
how people reach, grasp, manipulate, and transport objects.

• Passive  Observatories  for  Experimental  Microbial  Systems  (POEMS):
POEMS  will  study  the  growth,  ecology  and  performance  of  diverse  assem-
blages of micro-organisms in space. Understanding microbial growth and ecol-
ogy  in  a  space  environment  is  important  for  maintaining  human  health  and
bioregenerative life support functions.

• A Comprehensive Characterization of Micro-organisms and Allergens

in Spacecraft (SWAB):
SWAB uses genetic techniques for the first time to comprehensively evaluate
germs, including pathogens, on board the Space Station, and to study how the
germ community changes as spacecrafts visit the Space Station and modules
are  added.  This  study  will  monitor  Station  modules  prior  to  launch  to  evalu-
ate  sources  of  new  germs  and  find  ways  of  preventing  additional  contamina-
tion on board spacecraft.

• Crew Earth Observations (CEO):

CEO takes advantage of the crew in space to observe and photograph natural
and  man-made  changes  on  Earth,  the  photographs  record  Earth  surface
changes  over  time,  as  well  as  more  fleeting  events  such  as  storms,  floods,
fires,  and  volcanic  eruptions.  Together  they  provide  researchers  on  Earth
with vital, continuous images needed to better understand the planet.

Summary

As  stated  at  the  beginning  of  my  testimony,  using  the  Station  to  study  human
endurance  in  space  and  to  test  new  technologies  will  allow  us  to  prepare  for  the
longer  journeys  to  the  Moon,  Mars  and  beyond  in  support  of  the  Vision  for  Space
Exploration. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. My fellow witnesses and
I look forward to responding to any questions you may have.

her studies at NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, as a National Research
Council  Resident  Research  Associate.  From  April  1988  until  September  1989,
Whitson  served  as  the  Supervisor  for  the  Biochemistry  Research  Group  at  KRUG
International,  a  medical  sciences  contractor  at  NASA–JSC.  In  1991–1997,  Whitson
was also invited to be an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Department of Internal
Medicine  and  Department  of  Human  Biological  Chemistry  and  Genetics  at  Univer-
sity  of  Texas  Medical  Branch,  Galveston,  Texas.  In  1997,  Whitson  began  a  position
as Adjunct Assistant Professor at Rice University in the Maybee Laboratory for Bio-
chemical and Genetic Engineering.
NASA EXPERIENCE:

From  1989  to  1993,  Whitson  worked  as  a  Research  Biochemist  in  the  Biomedical
Operations  and  Research  Branch  at  NASA–JSC.  From  1991–1993,  she  served  as
Technical Monitor of the Biochemistry Research Laboratories in the Biomedical Op-
erations  and  Research  Branch.  From  1991–1992  she  was  the  Payload  Element  De-
veloper  for  Bone  Cell  Research  Experiment  (E10)  aboard  SL–J  (STS–47),  and  was
a  member  of  the  U.S.–USSR  Joint  Working  Group  in  Space  Medicine  and  Biology.
In 1992, she was named the Project Scientist of the Shuttle–Mir Program (STS–60,
STS–63,  STS–71,  Mir  18,  Mir  19)  and  served  in  this  capacity  until  the  conclusion
of the Phase 1A Program in 1995. From 1993–1996 Whitson held the additional re-
sponsibilities  of  the  Deputy  Division  Chief  of  the  Medical  Sciences  Division  at
NASA–JSC.  From  1995–1996  she  served  as  Co-Chair  of  the  U.S.-Russian  Mission
Science  Working  Group.  In  April  1996,  she  was  selected  as  an  astronaut  candidate
and  started  training,  in  August  1996.  Upon  completing  two  years  of  training  and
evaluation,  she  was  assigned  technical  duties  in  the  Astronaut  Office  Operations
Planning Branch and served as the lead for the Crew Test Support Team in Russia

human life sciences and microgravity sciences, as well as commercial payloads. The
Expedition 5 crew (one American Astronaut and two Russian Cosmonauts) returned
to  Earth  aboard  STS–113  on  December  7,  2002.  Completing  her  first  flight,  Dr.
Whitson logged 184 days, 22 hours and 14 minutes in space.

DISCUSSION

LESSONS LEARNED FOR LONG-DURATION SPACE FLIGHT

Chairman  CALVERT.  Thank  you.  Thank  you  for  giving  us  that

unique perspective on life on the International Space Station.

I am going to lead off with the questions since I believe we have

What  kinds  of  lessons  would  you  draw  from  your  time  on  the
Space Station that you think could be applied to our next steps be-
yond  Earth  orbit  or  return  to  the  Moon  and  then  going  to  Mars?

And that question is for both of you.
Dr.  WHITSON.  Yeah.  I  will  start  by  saying  that  during  my  mis-
sion,  we  hosted  three  different  Shuttle  flights,  and  they  were  all
very  robotically-intensive  missions  with  the  installation  of  hard-
ware  elements  on  board  the  International  Space  Station,  large
pieces  of  tress  that  filled  the  payload  bay  of  the  Shuttle,  and  so  it
was really exciting to be a part of that process of using the Station
robotic  arm,  in  one  case  of  actually  handing  off  one  piece  of  hard-
ware from one robotic arm to the other robotic arm for installation.
So  that  robotics  capability  is  going  to  be  something  that  is  impor-
tant  to  us  even  in  our  manned  exploration  to  the  Moon  and  Mars.

Chairman CALVERT. Turn on your mike.
Lieutenant Colonel FINCKE. There you go. Sorry about that. I can

fly a spacecraft, but I have got to learn how to do one of these.

On  our  mission,  it  was  Expedition  9.  It  was  the  third  mission  of
only  two  people  on  board.  Complete  resupply  from  Russian  cargo
ships.  And  we  launched  and  landed  on  a  Russian  Soyuz,  so  it  was
a  bit  different  than  Peggy’s  mission.  And  we  learned  a  few  neat
things  that  are  going  to  really  help  us  go  to  Mars  and  back  to  the
Moon.

We  are—we  had  problems  with  our  oxygen  generator,  and  we
learned how to work and fix things that we had not trained for on
the ground. We—Peggy was mentioning this medicine concept with
the ultrasound machine. Well, we were using tele-engineering to be
able  to  fix  things  that  were  broken.  And  that  is  an  important  les-
son  when  we  go  to  the  Moon  and  Mars.  We  won’t  be  able  to  know
how  to  fix  everything  all  by  ourselves,  but  we  have  a  strong  team
back on our home planet that can help us.

And  also,  we  learned  how  to  fix  our  own  space  suits.  That  was
the  first  time  we  opened  up  an  American  space  suit  and  changed
out parts. And that is the kind of thing we need to know when we
go  to  the  Moon  is  how  to  fix  our  own  space  suits.  So  we  became
more  self-sufficient,  but  also  more  dependent  on  the  ground  to
count  on  them  for—to  help  us  to  be  able  to  do  the  things  that  we
could do while we were up in space.

Chairman CALVERT. Thank you.
Mr. Udall.

SAFE HAVEN

Mr.  UDALL.  As  a  follow-on  to  Chairman  Calvert’s  question,  we
talked a lot about the aftermath of Columbia and the Accident In-
vestigation  Board.  We  talked  about  a  safe  haven  at  the  Station.
Could  you—both  of  you  talked  a  little  bit  about  what  it  would  be
like  if  the  Station  served  as  a  safe  haven  for  the  Shuttle.  What
would  be  the  challenges  you  would  face,  say  if  the  Shuttle  crew
were  there  for  one  to  two  months,  hopefully  no  longer  than  that?
Dr.  WHITSON.  Actually,  before  we  launch  STS–114,  the  next
Shuttle  to  launch,  we  will  understand  how  much  capability  in
terms of crew resupplies, oxygen, carbon dioxide removal, and food
that  we  will  have  on  orbit.  And  we  will  have  a  plan  in  place  on
how long we could withstand keeping that crew up there before we
could  send  a  rescue  mission.  And  there  will  actually  be  another
Shuttle on the pad ready to go within that time frame of when we
can  support  a  crew  on  board  the  Station.  So  it  is  not  ideal,  obvi-
ously,  but  obviously  we  are  not  going  to  invoke  the—that  scenario
unless it is a serious situation.

RESOURCE CONSUMPTION

Mr.  UDALL.  Doctor,  Lieutenant  Colonel  may  respond  as  well,
what is the number—the resource that runs out first, is it oxygen?
Is it——

Dr.  WHITSON.  Well,  actually  it  is  oxygen,  but  we  make  the  as-
sumption  that  the  electron,  our  oxygen-generating  system  is  not
working.  So  it  is  a—kind  of  almost  a  worst  case.  We  have  taken
one  failure  already  and  said  the  electron  was  not  working,  and  so
we are starting from that point.

Mr. UDALL. If it is working, is there an unlimited amount of oxy-

gen available?

nel Fincke?

Dr. WHITSON. Then water becomes——
Mr. UDALL. Okay.
Dr.  WHITSON.—inconsumable.  We  use  water  to  break  apart  to
make  the  oxygen.  So  water  then  becomes  a  limiting  consumable,
but——

Mr. UDALL. That’s your feed stock, the water is.
Dr. WHITSON. Yeah. Yeah.
Mr.  UDALL.  Okay.  Interesting.  Oxygen  is  in  the  water.  Every-

thing stems from water, doesn’t it?

Dr. WHITSON. Yeah.
Mr. UDALL. Did you want to say anything else, Lieutenant Colo-

Lieutenant  Colonel  FINCKE.  Certainly.  I  would  like  to  add  that
the Space Station right now is really designed, and has enough ca-
pability,  for  three  people.  To  increase  by—and  we  have  two  on
board. By increasing to six people, we are going to have to have all
of  our  systems  running  at  full  bore,  all  of  our  oxygen-generation
systems  and  the  carbon  dioxide-removal  system  and  things  like
that. And the engineers on the ground have really looked hard into
this  and  made  some  assumptions  of—towards  the  worst  case,  and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 07:13 Dec 08, 2005 Jkt 021710 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\061405\21710 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

23

we can definitely support—the Space Station can support for short
periods of time, enough time to get another Space Shuttle up there,
and that is good news for our friends in the astronaut corps.

Mr.  UDALL.  Even  with  the  converter—the  oxygen  converter

down, two months is within the time frame?

Dr.  WHITSON.  Actually,  I  think  the  latest  estimate  they  were
supposed  to  report  that  in  the  last  couple  of  days,  and  I  am  sorry
I don’t know that number, but it is on the order of 30 days.

Mr.  UDALL.  Okay.  What  about  space?  I  don’t  hear  you  talking

about any problems with space in the Shuttle itself.

Dr. WHITSON. Well——
Mr. UDALL. More crowded?
Dr.  WHITSON.—the  Shuttle  is  actually  very  crowded  normally,
but the Space Station will be much more crowded than it would be
normally, but——

Mr. UDALL. Yeah.
Dr.  WHITSON.—it  is  six  different  modules  on  orbit,  each  of  var-
ious  size,  but  there  is  plenty  of  room  for  the  seven  Shuttle  crew
members and an additional two Station crew members, if we need-
ed  to  do  that.  And  obviously  this  is  a  worst  case  scenario.  This  is
not  a  scenario  that  we  would  plan  to  do  except  for  a  scenario  that
required it to save the lives of our crew members.

Mr.  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  want  to  give  other

Members an opportunity, so thank you.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. Bonner.

EFFECTS OF LONG-DURATION SPACE FLIGHT

Mr. BONNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  hope  that  the  people  who  are  in  this  hearing  room,  especially
those  who  might  be  viewing  it  today  on  C–SPAN,  realize  how  his-
toric this is that we have got the first witness before our committee
in Congress that is not here, but is in outer space.

Dr.  Whitson,  you  were,  as  I  recall  from  reading  your  biography,
in  space  for  184  days.  That  is  a  long  time  to  be  away  from  home.
And  so  much  is  made  of  these  missions  about  the  effects  on  our
body,  the  physical  effect.  What  were  the  psychological  issues  that
you dealt with in space and then when you returned home that you
dealt  with  in  returning  home?  And  talk  to  us  a  little  bit,  please,
about the psychological aspects of space travel.

Dr.  WHITSON.  Well,  I  may  be  a  little  bit  unique  in  that  I  loved
every minute on board the Space Station. It was a phenomenal ex-
perience  to  me  being  there  I  think  probably  because  I  had  wanted
to  do  it  since  I  had  walked—watched  the  astronauts  walk  on  the
Moon. I have always wanted to be an astronaut. When I graduated
from  high  school,  it  was  the  first  year  they  selected  female  astro-
nauts,  and  that  is  when  I  decided  I  wanted  to  be  an  astronaut.
Luckily  for  me,  I  didn’t  know  how  hard  it  would  be  to  get  in,  but
I got lucky and I made it. The psychological part of being in space
is  actually  probably  less  traumatic  than  the  months  and  the  years
actually  leading  up  to  it  in  the  training  process.  We  do  about  half
of  our  training  in  Russia,  so  we  are  away  from  our  families  a
month  or  two  at  a  time  back  and  forth.  And  so  I  think  psycho-
logically  that  is  kind  of  the  building  block  for  families  to  build

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 07:13 Dec 08, 2005 Jkt 021710 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\061405\21710 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

24

those  relationships  to  be  able  to  withstand  going  to  space  for  six-
month periods of time. I tell my Expedition crew members in train-
ing,  ‘‘This  is  the  test.  If  you  can  make  this  work  then  being  on
board  the  Station  is  so  much  easier,  because  once  you  get  there,
you  have  such  an  interesting  job,  the  best  one  off  of  this  planet.’’
So  we—I  really  enjoyed  that  experience.  I  think  probably  the  only
long-lasting  psychological  impact  that  I  have  after  returning  to
Earth is that I really, really want to go back.

Mr. BONNER. Lieutenant Colonel.
Lieutenant  Colonel  FINCKE.  I  think  Peggy  is  not  unique  in  that
she  enjoyed  her  184  days.  I  enjoyed  my  187  days  I  hope  as  much
as she did. It was an amazing experience on an amazing Space Sta-
tion.  There  were  only  two  of  us  on  our  mission  and  so  there  was
less  company,  but  we  got  along  great.  My  commander  from  Russia
and  I,  we  got  along.  He  spoke  to  me  every  day  in  English,  and  I
spoke to him in Russian. We saw each other eye to eye, and looking
outside  at  the  beautiful  planet  below,  we  never  really  got  grumpy,
because  any  time  we  felt  anything  sad  or  bad,  we  just  looked  out-
side.  But  we  also  had  a  space  telephone,  and  we  could  call  down
and keep in touch with our families. And while I was on board the
Space  Station,  my  wife  had  our  second  child,  our  daughter,  who
was  born  while  I  was  up  there,  and  this  is  not  unique  to  service
families that are all over serving our country across the world, but
this  was  unique  in  that  is  the  first  time  it  happened  to  an  astro-
naut  in  space.  But  I  was  able  to  talk  to  my  wife  up  to  the  point
where labor was happening and keep in touch for those, you know,
days afterwards when we were happy as a couple to be able to, you
know,  welcome  our  daughter  into  the  world.  And  so  a  lot  goes  to
our  families  for  supporting  us  while  we  are  in  training  in  Russia
and training—and flying in space. But the psychological aspects, it
felt like we weren’t that far away from home.

Mr.  BONNER.  If  I  may  ask  just  a  quick  follow-up  to  both  of  you.
When  most  Americans  travel  away  from  home  for  10  days  or  two
weeks  and  they  get  back  home,  the  first  thing  they  want  to  do  is
have  X  or  Y.  What  was  it  for  you?  Was  it  a  Big  Mac?  Diet  Coke?

Dr. WHITSON. For me, I wanted a steak and a salad.
Lieutenant  Colonel  FINCKE.  And  I  was  looking  forward  to  my
mother-in-law’s  cooking.  She  came  all  of  the  way  out  to  Russia  to
cook me a nice Indian meal.

Mr.  BONNER.  That  is  a  very  good,  politically  correct  answer,

Lieutenant Colonel.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman CALVERT. Thank you.
Mr. Bartlett.

NASA’S ROLE IN INSPIRING YOUTH

Mr. BARTLETT. I can remember very well when the Soviet Union
launched their first Sputnik. I can remember the excitement, Octo-
ber  sky,  watching  that  sky  for  the  satellite  to  go  over.  I  remember
when  President  Kennedy  challenged  the  Nation  to  put  a  man  on
the  Moon  within  a  decade.  That  was  a  big,  big  challenge,  and  we
did  it  in  something  less  than  a  decade.  I  remember  trying  to  stay
up at night to watch the video of the Moon landing. And somehow,
since the excitement of those days, space flight has become kind of

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 07:13 Dec 08, 2005 Jkt 021710 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\061405\21710 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

25

ho-hum,  and  it  is  because,  I  think,  NASA  has  been  so  successful
that the American public has been led to believe that this is a pret-
ty  routine,  unexciting  thing.  And  there  are  two  deficits  that  have
occurred because of that.

One is we aren’t able to get the kind of funding that we need for
NASA and our space programs, particularly our manned programs,
because  they  don’t  have  the  excitement  that  they  once  had  for  the
American people.

The  other  deficiency  is  that  we  desperately  need  something  in
our  country  that  captures  the  imagination  of  our  people  and  in-
spires our young people to go into careers of science, math, and en-
gineering. Putting a man on the Moon really did that. I remember
a  cartoon  I  saw,  a  little  freckle-faced,  bucktoothed  kid.  He  said,
‘‘Six months ago, I couldn’t even spell engineer and now I are one.’’
You know, everybody wanted to be a part of that program.

It  really  is  very  hazardous  duty.  We  have  only—there  is  a  one
chance  in  50  you  are—roughly  one  chance  in  50  you  are  not  going
to make it, if the past is going to predict the future in terms of our
space flights. Is that not correct, two out of 100 and some missions?
Is  that  right?  And  so  what  have  we  done,  or  what  should  we  have
done  differently  so  that  it  didn’t  lose  its  luster,  so  that  this  was
still  exciting,  so  that  people  were  still  riveted  to  their  television
sets, so that our kids still wanted to be a scientist, mathematician,
or engineer, or an astronaut? And you know, we are paying for that
as a nation now because we have far too few of our kids going into
those disciplines. How did we fail, and what do we need to do now
so that we can recoup?

Dr.  WHITSON.  Well,  that  is  a  pretty  big  question,  and  I  wish  I

had the answer in my back pocket on that one.

I am not sure how we failed. I do think it is just as critically im-
portant  now  as  it  was  in  the  1960s.  I  mean,  I  was  inspired.  But
every  time  I  go  out  to  talk  to  young  school  children,  you  know,  I
feel it is my job to at least convince one of those young people that
they  can  do  something  that  they  didn’t  think  they  could  before  I
came.

Lieutenant  Colonel  FINCKE.  One  of  NASA’s  three  main  mission
statements  is  to  inspire  the  next  generation  of  explorers,  as  only
NASA can. And I would certainly hate to be a witness and disagree
with you, sir, but every school that I have gone to, and since I have
come  back  from  space  I  have  talked  to  over  16,000  school  kids
across our country, and I haven’t found anybody that was not inter-
ested in space and not interested in what we did aboard the Space
Station and who didn’t laugh when the Commander’s hair stuck up
and  watching  us  play  with  our  food  and  all  of  the  joy  and  wonder
and  imagination  to  go  fly  in  space.  And  I  think  that  imagination
is  still  among  our  youth,  and  it  is  just  up  to  us  to  just  close  the
loop and let them know that, you know, America is the land of op-
portunity  and  you,  too,  can  be  an  astronaut  or  an  engineer  or  a
mommy or a daddy or whatever it is that you want to be when you
grow  up,  because  this  is  the  place  where  dreams  come  true.  And
I think NASA is doing that.

Mr. BARTLETT. But it would be nice if we could translate that ex-
citement  that  you  generate  in  the  classroom  to  more  of  our  kids
going  into  science,  math,  and  engineering,  because  it  is  not  hap-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 07:13 Dec 08, 2005 Jkt 021710 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\061405\21710 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

26

pening,  and  that  is  our  challenge.  You  go  to  our  schools,  like  tech-
nical  schools,  and  more  than  half  of  the  students  there  are  foreign
nationals.  And  our  country—our  companies  now  are  wanting  more
immigrants  to  come  in  because  they  can’t  find  enough  scientists,
mathematicians, and engineers in this country.

So you know, thank you for inspiring our school children. I hope
that  it  is  reflected  with  an  increased  number  of  our  young  people
going into these careers.

For the short-term, it threatens our economic superiority. For the
long-term,  it  threatens  our  military  superiority.  We  have  got  to
have  adequate  numbers  of  bright  young  people  going  into  science,
math,  and  engineering.  And  you  all  are  voices  that  are  helping  us
do  that.  Thank  you  very  much  for  the  contribution  that  you  are
making.

LANGUAGE BARRIERS

Chairman CALVERT. I see we have been joined by our friend from
Louisiana.  If  you  would  like  to  ask  a  question  before  we  tune  into
our  friend  in  outer  space—well,  I  am  just  going  to—we  still  have
a few minutes, so I am going to ask a question.

I  was  listening  to  Colonel  Fincke  when  we  were  talking  about
use  of  language.  Is  that  much  of  a  barrier?  Is  that  a  significant
issue  when  you  are  up  there  in  outer  space?  Do  you  understand
each other pretty well or—I guess my question is, is everybody tak-
ing—at NASA, is everybody learning Russian and everybody in the
Russian astronaut corps learning English?

Lieutenant  Colonel  FINCKE.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  like  in  any  or-

ganization, communication is fundamental to mission success.

Chairman CALVERT. You have a point. I have a hard time under-

standing some of the members I serve with here, so——

Lieutenant Colonel FINCKE. And really, that is—so whatever lan-
guage  it  takes,  we  have  learned  to  communicate  with  each  other
on board. And we have learned to communicate with the long part-
nership  with  Russia  to  communicate  with  each  other.  And  some-
times, like any other organization, the communication isn’t perfect,
but  I  think,  for  the  most  part,  we  really  understand  each  other.
And that is really fundamentally why things aboard the Space Sta-
tion are a success is because we have good, solid working relation-
ships.  We  know  each  other’s  strengths  and  weaknesses,  and  we
have  built  off  of  that  and  have  worked  together  as  a  team.  Now  it
is  not  a  perfect  team.  Sometimes  there  is  a  little  bit  of  grumbling
and  the  press  loves  to  talk  about  that,  but  if  you  look  at  it  right
now,  and  you  are  going  to  see,  you  know.  Dr.  Phillips  is  up  there
with Sergei Krikalev working together in space, and that is a really
nice symbol for all of us to see people working together.

Chairman CALVERT. Any add-on to that, Doctor?
Dr.  WHITSON.  Well,  I  would  just  like  to  say  that  in  addition  to
the  interpersonal  requirements  of  doing  something  like  building
the  International  Space  Station,  there  is  also  an  incredible  engi-
neering level of interaction that is required. I think it is somewhat
miraculous  that  we  have  done  such  an  incredible  job  building  the
Space Station. As was mentioned a little bit earlier, sometimes we
maybe  make  it  look  a  little  too  easy.  It  really  is  quite  miraculous
that we have gotten all of these pieces together.

SPACE SUITS

Chairman  CALVERT.  Quite  an  engineering  feat.  I  always—people
ask  me  why  do  you  have  two  different  space  suits  when  you  are
up there? Is that make—does everything match up when you have
the  cosmonaut  in  one  space  suit  and  the  Americans,  of  course,  in
our own space suit?

Dr.  WHITSON.  For  any  given  EVA,  we  use  the  same  space  suit,
but  there  are  some  tasks  that  we  do  on  the  U.S.  side  that  we  use
the  U.S.  space  suit  for  and  some  on  the  Russian  side.  Mike  has  a
unique perspective on that from his real life experience.

Lieutenant Colonel FINCKE. By having two sets of things, the re-
dundancy  it  makes  our  engineering  plan—to  give  us  success.  In
other words, we were getting ready to go outside in American space
suits,  and  we  were  going  through  a  dress  rehearsal,  and  it  turns
out  that  his  American  space  suit  was  broken.  We  ended  up  fixing
it  by  the  end  of  the  mission,  but  because  we  had  a  spare  set  of
space  suits  built  by  the  Russians,  they  didn’t  have  the  same  prob-
lem, and we were able to go up just a week or two later in the Rus-
sian  space  suits  and  accomplish  the  task.  And  that  just  goes  to
show  having  strength  of  a  partnership  and  having  the  redundancy
aboard the Space Station is teaching us those lessons that we need
to  so  when  we  go  back  to  the  Moon  and  Mars  we  are  taking  note
of all of this.

Chairman  CALVERT.  Great.  Well,  I  understand  that  we  are  get-
ting  down  to  about  the—at  about  one  minute.  So  I  will  ask  Mr.
Udall  if  you  want  to  ask  anything  in  the  minute  we  have  remain-
ing?

RADIATION

Mr. UDALL. Talk a little bit, if you will, about the radiation con-
cerns on the Station and what you do about it, and if we have any
more  time,  what  we  project  out  on  the  Moon  or  on  Mars  when  it
comes to radiation exposure.

Dr. WHITSON. On board the Space Station itself, we actually have
radiation  monitoring  hardware  with  alarm  systems  that  will  tell
the crew if it is getting into a hazardous level. But before that ever
happens,  the  ground  typically  will  warn  the  crew  that  we  antici-
pate  that  the  radiation  levels  will  go  higher  at  a  certain  point  in
time and recommend that they would go——

Chairman  CALVERT.  If  I  may  interrupt,  I  think  we  are  ready  to

LESSONS LEARNED FOR LONG-DURATION SPACE FLIGHT

(CONT.)

Chairman  CALVERT.  And  now  we  go  live  from  space,  Inter-

national Space Station, with Dr. John Phillips.

Doctor, I asked the same question to your two colleagues. I want
to ask you the same question that I asked them. What kinds of les-
sons would you draw from your time on the Space Station that you
think could be applied to our next steps beyond Earth orbit and for
our return to the Moon and then going on to Mars?

Dr.  PHILLIPS.  Yes,  sir.  First,  welcome  aboard  the  International
Space  Station.  It  is  my  pleasure  to  welcome  aboard  the  ladies  and
gentlemen  of  the  House  Subcommittee  on  Space  and  Aeronautics.
Since I am a former Navy guy, I feel an obligation to welcome you
aboard.

I appreciate the opportunity to talk.
Well,  I  have  been  here  about  two  months  now,  and  I  have
learned  lessons,  and  we  have  learned  lessons  every  day.  And  I
would  like  to  emphasize  that  up  here  on  the  International  Space
Station, we are the experiment, not only we, the crew, but the vehi-
cle,  the  equipment  on  it,  our  operations  concept,  our  mission  con-
trol  operations,  and  even  our  international  partnership.  And  I—
what I have learned, I believe, is that we need to build equipment
with as much attention to the low maintenance, as much attention
to  reliability  as  possible,  and  we  need  to  keep  doing  what  we  are
doing  with  our  multiple  layers  of  redundancy.  We  take  safety  very
seriously,  and  we  build  things  with  an  eye  to  a  redundancy,  mul-
tiple  pipelines,  multiple  equipment  that  does  the  same  thing.  And
if  one  thing  fails,  we  have  got  another  to  back  it  up.  And  I  think
we have used that approach to very good success on the Space Sta-
tion,  and  I  want  to  see  us  keep  doing  it  in  the  future  in  our  next
missions as well.

Chairman  CALVERT.  I  thank  the  gentleman  for  his  answer,  and
I  will  move  on  to  our—to  Mr.  Udall  who  leads  the  Minority,  from
Colorado.

Mr. UDALL. Dr. Phillips, this is Mark Udall. I represent a portion
of Colorado, including half the ski areas. I am sure you can see all
of  the  snow  in  Colorado  that  we  have  had  over  the  winter,  which
means great water supplies for my friend from California and oth-
ers in the southwest.

Chairman CALVERT. Thank you.

ISS AND THE VIEW OF EARTH

Mr.  UDALL.  Wax  philosophical  and  talk  a  little  bit  about  what
the  view  is  like  both  looking  into  space  as  well  as  back  at  the
Earth.

Dr. PHILLIPS. Well, as luck would have it, we traveled over Colo-
rado  a  couple  of  hours  ago,  and  I  shot  some  pictures  starting  from
the Sawtooth Mountains in Idaho and then down through Wyoming
and  across  the  front  range  in  Colorado,  and  it  was  very  beautiful,
and I can see here that you had a good snow year.

The view is incredible from up here. And by the way, right now,
we are moving southeast, more or less parallel to the coast of Cali-
fornia  in  the  north  Pacific.  We  will  be  heading  down  along  the
Baja.  The  view  is  incredible.  We  get  the  white  snow  and  the  blue
oceans  and  the  tan  deserts  and  the  green  forests,  and  what  it
brings home to me is that we are a pretty small planet, we are all
one  people,  and  we  need  to  conserve  the  resources  we  have,  and
make sure we work together to make this place a livable for many
generations to come.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. Bonner, you are recognized for two minutes.
Mr. BONNER. Dr. Phillips, my name is Joe Bonner, and I am from
Mobile,  Alabama,  and  my  home  state  is  very  proud  of  its  role  in
manned space flights.

The  Chairman  has  only  given  us  two  minutes  to  ask  our  ques-
tion, and normally those of us from the South, it takes two minutes
just to get our name out, so my question to you is very brief. After
all  of  your  training  and  preparation  and  now  that  you  are  there,
what  was  your  biggest  surprise  being  on  board  the  Space  Station
and living in outer space?

Dr.  PHILLIPS.  Well,  I  think  my  biggest  surprise  up  here,  and  I
have been here, by the way, once before on a shorter Shuttle flight,
my biggest surprise I think was how much work goes into the prep-
aration  for  visiting  vehicles.  For  example,  just  15  minutes  ago,
Commander  Russian  cosmonaut  Sergei  Krikalev,  closed  the  hatch
on  a  Russian  supply  ship,  about  to  say  goodbye  to  that  ship,  and
then we are going to get another one in a couple days. And it takes
a  lot  of  work  to  pack  that  Progress  vehicle  with  the  stuff  we  don’t
need  anymore  and  to  unpack,  and  then  as  soon  as  we  get  the  new
one aboard in just a few days, then we are going to start in earnest
preparing  to  support  the  launch  of  the  Shuttle  Discovery  and  its
mission  to  dock  here  on  Station.  And  that  is  just  a  whole  lot  of
work,  and  for  a  couple  weeks,  it  really  dominates  our  activities  up
here.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
The gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Melancon.
Mr.  MELANCON.  My  only  question,  and  this  is  Congressman
Charlie  Melancon  from  Louisiana,  is  are  your  feet  strapped  down
so you are not floating?

Dr. PHILLIPS. Yes, sir. They are not—well, they are not strapped
down. Right now, I am not wearing any shoes. We only wear shoes,
pretty  much,  for  exercise,  but  I  have  got  my  stocking  clad  feet
tucked  under  a  railing  on  the  floor,  because  if  I  didn’t  do  that,  I
would just kind of float around like this.

Thank you.
Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
The gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Bartlett.

ISS ORBIT

Mr. BARTLETT. Hi, this is Roscoe Bartlett from Maryland.
Could  you  tell  us  what  type  of  an  orbit  you  are  in,  the  altitude

and the parts of the world that you see from your orbit?

Dr.  PHILLIPS.  Sir,  we  are  in  nearly  a  circular  orbit  at  a  speed  of
about  eight  kilometers  per  second  at  an  altitude  of  350  kilometers
right  now.  That  is  near  the  lower  range  of  our  orbit.  Sometimes  it
is  a  bit  higher.  It  takes  us  about  90  minutes  to  go  around  the
Earth.  And  we  are  in  an  orbital  inclination  of  51.6  degrees,  which
is  dictated  by  the  fact  that  basically  half  of  the  Station  plus  our
Russian  Soyuz  vehicle  and  supply  vehicles  are  launched  from  base
in central Asia that, for various orbital reasons, needs to launch to
that  inclination.  And  what  that  means  is  we  see  all  of  the  Earth,
the  low  latitudes  of  maybe  a  little  bit  higher  than  our  inclination,
maybe about 55 or 57 degrees. We can see that far north and that
far  south.  And  actually  my  crewmate,  Sergei  Krikalev,  is  taking
pictures  of  his  hometown  of  St.  Petersburg,  which  is  nearly  at  60
degrees.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. Costa from California.

ISS COMPLETION

Mr. COSTA. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Congressman Jim Costa from California from Fresno.
Dr.  Phillips,  obviously  we  are  pleased  that  you  could  be  here
today  for  this  presentation.  You  know,  oftentimes  the  question  is
asked  for  what  purpose  is  the  Space  Station.  When  we  look  at  our
nation’s budget priorities and we look at our nation’s priorities with
regard  to  our  space  program,  both  the  manned  and  the  unmanned
space  program,  today,  as  you  sit  there  from  your  vantagepoint,
what percentage of the Space Station is completed? And when it is
completed in its entirety, what do you believe the capabilities of the
Space  Station  will  be  as  we  try  to  answer  the  question  toward
these priorities?

Dr. PHILLIPS. Well, thanks for your question, sir, and by the way,
I  used  to,  I  believe,  live  in  your  District  down  in  the  Navy  base  of
Lemoore, California.

Mr. COSTA. It is a great Navy station.
Dr. PHILLIPS. I have fond memories of that place.
Mr. COSTA. I hope you are still registered to vote there.
Dr. PHILLIPS. And I would guess that the Station is maybe a lit-
tle  over  half  completed.  I  am  just  making  up—we  have  got  some
more large pressurized modules to build. There is a laboratory from
Europe  and  a  laboratory  from  Japan.  And  excuse  me,  I  just  said
the  wrong  thing.  They  are  already  built,  but  we  have  some  more
pressurized modules to launch. And then we have got a lot of other
big  pieces  waiting  at  Kennedy  Space  Center  right  now  for  the  re-
sumption of Shuttle flight.

Eventually,  we  expect  to  have  a  crew  of  six  up  here,  and  right
now,  with  Sergei  and  I  with  a  crew  of  two,  much  of  our  work—al-
though we are doing scientific experimentation as well. When there
are  six  people  on  board,  there  will  be  a  lot  more  scientific  experi-
mentation,  experimentation  designed  to  advance  our  knowledge  in
combustion, and material science, in biology, and I believe most im-
portantly,  just  to  advance  our  knowledge  in  how  to  push  further
into space.

I  would  like  to  mention  that  the  International  Space  Station  is
maintaining  our  presence  in  space  and  maintaining  our  national
credibility  as  a  worthy  partner  in  an  international  technical
project.  We  constantly  learn  new  lessons  up  here  about  hardware,
software. The experiences we gather up here that will enable us to
establish  a  long-term  station  on  the  Moon  and  to  go  on  to  Mars.

Mr. COSTA. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman CALVERT. Thank you.
Mr. Rohrabacher.

ISS RESEARCH ACCOMPLISHMENTS

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Hello.  I  am  Congressman  Dana  Rohrabacher

from California, Huntington Beach, California. And greetings.

Okay. I will proceed.
We have learned a lot about human habitation of space by what
we have done at the Space Station and by you and others who have
spent  time  there.  You  are  right  there  right  now.  Could  you  tell  us
if  you  believe  that  there  is  any  further  commercial  potential  for
Space  Station?  And  number  two,  you  mentioned  the  research  po-
tential  a  few  moments  ago.  Could  you  go  into  some  specific  detail
about  what  type  of  accomplishments—research  accomplishments
we could expect if we continue supporting the Station?

Dr.  PHILLIPS.  Well,  sir,  as  I  mentioned,  right  now  our  experi-
mental  time  is  somewhat  limited,  but  I  am  going  to  give  you  an
example  of  an  experiment  we  are  working  with.  It  is  called  ad-
vanced diagnostic ultrasound in microgravity. Now this experiment
uses  medical  ultrasound  and  high  data—plus  a  team  of  specialists
on the ground to enable non-specialists like me to provide state-of-
the-art  diagnostic  imaging  of  heart,  lungs,  abdomen,  and  arteries.
This  has  great  potential  for  use  in  remote  areas  in  places  where
you  don’t  have  diagnostic  specialists  and  for  military  uses  on  bat-
tlefield diagnostics, for example. That is an example of one kind of
experiment  we  are  going  to  do—we  are  doing  up  here  now.  When
we  have  three  full  operational  laboratories,  the  Japanese,  Euro-
pean,  and  American  laboratory  up  here  with  teams  of  scientists
working in those labs pretty much full time, I believe we will have
the  potential  for  advancements  in  pharmaceuticals,  for  example,
and we have pharmaceutical research going on right now, and also
material science. I think those are the two biggest areas. It is hard
for  me  to  put—to  predict  the  kind  of  results  of  these  things,  but
I want to emphasize once more that from my perspective, the most
important  thing  up  here  is  that  we  are  the  experiment.  We  are
learning how to fly in space.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much.
Chairman CALVERT. Thank you very much.

THE IMPACT ON ISS FROM THE SHUTTLE GROUNDING
Mr. MILLER. Yes, this is Brad Miller from North Carolina.
What  has  been  the  impact  on  your  mission  of  the  grounding  of
the  Shuttle  fleet?  Has  that  affected  your  procedures  in  any  way?
Dr.  PHILLIPS.  I  would  describe  the  gravity  of  the  Shuttle  fleet  in
sort—first  and  foremost,  the  assembly,  as  I  have  mentioned,  there
are  tresses,  solar  rays,  and  new  pressurized  modules  as  well  as  a
lot  of  laboratory  equipment  and  spare  parts  waiting  at  Kennedy
Space Center in Florida to be launched. Two of the modules sched-
uled for launch in the next couple of years are laboratories that be-
long to Japan and Europe.

The  second  impact,  the  use  of  ISS  has  been  limited  to  two  per-
sons  since  the  Columbia  accident  with  the  limitations  on  delivery
of consumables, such as oxygen, water, and food.

Third,  although  our  Russian  partners  have  done  an  admirable
job  in  keeping  the  Station  supplied,  without  the  Shuttle,  we  have
been  operating  on  somewhat—there  are  certain  spare  parts  that
can only be delivered by the Shuttle, plus only the Shuttle has the
capability  of  carrying  large  cargo  back  to  Earth.  So  we  are  really
looking  forward  to  seeing  the  Discovery  about  a  month  from  now.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. Green.

RUSSIAN COOPERATION

Mr. GREEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Dr.  Phillips,  I  had  the  good  fortune  about  two  weeks  ago  to  be
in  Russia  and  to  meet  with  the  Deputy  Head  of  the  space  agency.
One  of  the  things  that  we  talked  about  was  the  great  spirit  of  co-
operation  that  has  been  engendered  as  a  result  of  this  noble  mis-
sion  that  you  find  yourself  a  part  of.  Could  you  kindly  make  some
comments about the spirit of cooperation that has manifested itself
as you go about your business there in the outer part of our world?
Dr.  PHILLIPS.  Speaking  from  the  standpoint  of  an  astronaut,  not
a  manager,  not  a  negotiator,  I  would  say  that  cooperation  is  won-
derful. I have got my crewmate, Sergei Krikalev, 10 feet away from
me  right  now.  We  work  together  and  live  together.  We  did  about
50  percent  of  our  training  in  the  United  States  and  50  percent  in
Russia, and it is almost a situation without boundaries. We go from
one  to  the  other,  trained  equally  well.  And  we—just  this  morning,
we  have  both  been  talking  to  our  mission  control  center  in  Hous-
ton,  our  mission—our  American  payload  center  in  Huntsville,  Ala-
bama,  and  our  mission  control  center  in  Moscow.  So  I  think,  from
an  operational  standpoint,  our  two  countries  have  really  merged
their programs very, very well. And I can’t really speak to the dip-
lomatic  and  financial  negotiation  end  of  it,  because  that  is  way
above my pay grade.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.

SAFETY

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Thank you.
Congresswoman  Jackson  Lee  from  Houston,  Texas.  Johnson

Space Center is in our neighborhood.

Thank you for your service.
My  question  is  how  comfortable  are  you  with  the  safety  record
of the International Space Station and are you seeing improvement
in the safety review and, of course, the quality of safety on the Sta-
tion?

Thank you.
Dr.  PHILLIPS.  I  have  always  been  confident  about  the  quality  of
safety  up  here.  We  take  safety  very  seriously.  We  safeguard  our
health through an exercise program involving bikes, treadmills, re-
sistive devices. We have multiple levels of redundancy. I think one
of  the  lessons  that  was  brought  home  from  the  Columbia  accident
is that we have got to stamp out complacency wherever we find it.
We have got to remember that this is a risky business, not like get-
ting  on  an  airliner.  We  strap  ourselves  on  rockets,  and  it  still  has
some  risks.  I  think  our  safety  record  on  the  Station  has  been  good
since the onset, and I think it is continuing to improve.

Chairman CALVERT. I want to thank you, Doctor, for your hospi-
tality and allowing us to visit with you up there in outer space and
for  answering  our  questions.  We  have  about  10  seconds  left,  so  I
wanted to say goodbye, and would love it if you said goodbye to us,
too. Be safe.

Dr.  PHILLIPS.  I  thank  you  very  much,  sir.  And  it  has  been  a
pleasure  talking  to  the  ladies  and  gentleman  of  the  Committee,
from  the  testing  module  in  the  American  laboratory  aboard  the

Chairman CALVERT. Well, that was exciting.
Mr. Udall, you are recognized for a question.
RESEARCH ABOARD THE ISS

Mr.  UDALL.  Would  you  talk  a  little  bit  more  about  the  research
possibilities  as  well  as,  perhaps,  some  of  the  experiments  you  con-
ducted and some of the lessons that you have learned, Dr. Whitson,
Lieutenant Colonel?

Dr.  WHITSON.  Sure,  I  think  John  introduced  it  very  well.  Some-
times  it  is  very  hard  for  us  to  predict  what  the  outcome  is  and
what  will  be  the  best  research  to  do  on  board  the  Station.  That  is
true  of  research  here  on  the  ground  as  well.  Sometimes  the  most
interesting  questions  are,  ‘‘I  wonder  why  that  happened.’’  But  I
think,  you  know,  there  is  a  lot  of  potential.  I  had  the  opportunity
to  work  on  zeolite  crystal  formations.  Zeolites  are  used  in  petro-
leum  processing  and  in  pollution  control,  and  we  actually  used
them  on  board  the  Space  Station  as  part  of  our  carbon  dioxide  re-

moval  system.  I  had  the  opportunity  to  melt  superconductor  crys-
tals  under  different  conditions  to  try  and  optimize  crystal  growth
and  get  the  biggest  superconductor  crystals  possible.  And  John
talked  about  the—ultrasound  is  another  one  that  obviously  also
has direct ground applications as well.

Anything to add, Michael?
Lieutenant Colonel FINCKE. One thing there was a big difference
between  Dr.  Whitson’s  mission  and  the  one  I  was  on  was  they—
we  didn’t  have  as  much  cargo  mass  up  and  cargo  mass  down,  so
even  though  we  could  have  done  some  really  very  interesting  ex-
periments,  we  couldn’t  bring  down  all  of  the  results.  So  we  have
learned, during the two-person crew post-Columbia missions of how
to  send  down  video  at  higher  qualities.  We  have  learned  how  to
do—make  due  with  the  experimental  materials  we  have  on  board
and to do research that way and to also get the high-quality results
down  without  actually  having  to  send  down  the  pieces,  the  experi-
mental  samples  themselves.  However,  when  the  Space  Shuttle
starts  flying  again,  and  it  is  going  to  fly  again  soon,  it  is  going  to
represent a big boom in the capabilities of science, because we will
be  able  to  take  up  a  whole  bunch  of  experiments  that  have  been
waiting and bring down the experimental results that are on board
right now.

RADIATION

Mr.  UDALL.  If  I  could,  I  would  like  to  go  back  to  the  radiation
question that we—but I do want to just mention that I thought Dr.
Phillips  and  you—both  of  you  have  been  very  compelling  in  point-
ing  out  that  the  whole  enterprise  is  an  experiment.  Sometimes  we
are looking for these specific outcomes, but just the fact that we are
there  and  have  been  there  for  as  long  as  we  have  been  there  is  a
case  and  a  story  we  ought  to  continue  to  tell.  It  is  pretty  remark-
able what we have succeeded in doing.

The—I  have  read  concerns  expressed  on  the  radiation  question
that  it  is  still  undetermined  to  what  extent  we  can  live  on  a  place
like the Moon or Mars given the potential radiation exposures. You
were  talking  a  little  bit  about  the  Station  and  what  you  do.  You
have  suits  that  you  put  on  and  so  on  when  there  would  be  radi-
ation episodes. But would you just talk in the two minutes we have
remaining about the radiation and your concerns?

Dr.  WHITSON.  Sure.  As  I  mentioned,  we  have  procedures  on
board  to  minimize  the  effects  of  the  crew,  but  the  magnetosphere
of  the  Earth  actually  provides  a  lot  of  radiation  protection  to  us,
so  even  understanding  this,  we  have  to  take  it  another  level  up  to
understand  the  risks  that  we  are  going  to  be  taking  on  the  Moon
and on Mars. And radiation shielding is going to be one of the im-
portant factors in whatever vehicles we develop, whatever modules
we have, you know. We may have to—we may choose to do safe ha-
vens,  you  know,  within  a  small  compartment  area,  because  that
might  be  logistically  easier  to  accomplish.  So—but  we  do  have  to
do  some  sort  of  radiation  protection  in  our  future  missions.  It  is
going to be critical, because it is a much higher radiation level out-
side the Earth’s magnetosphere. And even in 250 miles, we are still
protected,  even  though  it  is  much  higher  than  it  is  here  in  Wash-
ington, DC.

Mr.  UDALL.  There  might  be  some  people  saying  there  is  a  lot  of

radiation in this town, but Lieutenant Colonel.

Lieutenant  Colonel  FINCKE.  Once  we  get  on  to  a  planetary  sur-
face,  and  that  is  the  trick,  we  can  actually  use  some  of  the  re-
sources there. We can—I don’t want to say live underground on the
Moon,  but  we  can  use  some  of  the  lunar  regolith,  the  soil  that  is
there,  and  use  it  to  help  protect  us.  And  some  of  the  tricks  that
we  are  going  to  learn  on  the  Moon  are  going  to  be  applicable  to
Mars, because Mars doesn’t have a magnetosphere to protect it like
we  do  here  on  planet  Earth.  So  there  are  a  lot  of  tricks  and  a  lot
of  neat  things  that  we  don’t  even  completely  understand  now,  but
we are going to understand as we take this voyage together.
Mr. UDALL. The experiment would continue on the Moon?
Dr. WHITSON. Exactly.
Mr.  UDALL.  Thank  you  very  much.  Again,  I  am  in  awe  of  your
service  and  your  commitment  to  pushing  the  envelope,  looking  out
over the horizon. Thank you.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. Bonner.

BENEFITS OF HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT

Mr. BONNER. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
I  would  like  to  follow-up  with  the  question  that  Congressman

Bartlett asked both of you but phrase it a little bit differently.

Clearly, I grew up watching Apollo as well. It was a community-
wide  event.  We  would  all  go  to  the  house  that  had  the  color  TV,
if  we  were  fortunate  enough  to  have  one  in  our  town,  to  sit  and
watch,  as  a  community  and  as  a  nation  and  as  a  world,  in  awe  of
what was happening. And perhaps because you all were so success-
ful  and  your  predecessors  were  so  successful,  we  did  begin  to  take
things for granted until tragedy came our way.

I guess my question to you is, there are a lot of media here, this
is  being  broadcast  on  C–SPAN.  You  have  got  four  minutes  and  16
seconds  to  give  a  PSA  on  the  advances  in  arthritis,  the  advances
in aging, advances in kidney stone that NASA has played a role in
helping our physicians, our scientists, our engineers here on Earth
make big progress up in space.

Dr. WHITSON. Well, it is always kind of awesome to try and think
about  all  of  the  different  things  that  we  have  actually  had  input
into  in  terms  of  sensor  technologies  that  applied  in  medical  sce-
narios. But one of the more interesting stories I always like to tell
is  the  one  about  the  development  of  the  artificial  assisted  heart
pump, because that developed because they needed a mechanism to
reduce  the  bubbling  flow  in  the  artificial  hearts.  And  they  used
similar  technologies  that  we  used  in  the  engines  on  the  Shuttle.
And so it is actually a very indirect application of some engineering
thing that we learned to go to space that was applied to people’s—
saving  people’s  lives  and  giving  them  an  artificial  heart  until  they
could get a transplant.

So there are just some really interesting stories out there. I hope
that some of the experiments that I was involved in will have some
potential  payoff  in  the  future.  I  think  in  particular,  on  my  study,
on  the  renal  stones,  we  are  interested  in  applying  something  that

36

we  know  here  on  Earth  and  hopefully  maybe  there  will  be  some
payback later on after we have tested it in zero gravity as well.

Lieutenant  Colonel  FINCKE.  I  am  a  pretty  healthy  guy,  but
aboard  the  Space  Station  for  187  days  and  24  hours—21  hours,  I
lost  a  fair  amount  of  bone  mass,  roughly  about  six  percent,  and  I
exercised a lot. In fact, that is what we have seen with humans in
space  is  we  lose,  without  gravity,  now  matter  how  hard  we  exer-
cise, somewhere between one and two percent of our bone mass per
month. Now that is accelerated osteoporosis. And by understanding
that—and  fortunately  it  all  came  back  for  me,  but  by  under-
standing  how  we  lose  it,  the  mechanisms,  and  how  we  can  get  it
back, is very important to a lot of our population who are suffering
with osteoporosis right now. There is a direct tie. We—on our mis-
sion, we were the first mission to actually image our bones as they
changed over time with this ultrasound machine that we have been
mentioning.  So  these  are  some  direct  applications  to  the  science  of
osteoporosis.

But  space  is  definitely  an  investment  in  the  country’s  future.
When  I  was  up  there,  I  saw  four  hurricanes—or  actually,  I  saw
them  all  last  summer,  and  John  is  going  to  see,  unfortunately,
some  this  year.  But  it—I  always  reflected  that  we  lost  very  few
people’s  lives,  especially  American  lives,  because  of  the  space  pro-
gram.  We  knew  ahead  of  time  that  these  hurricanes  were  coming.
Back  in  the  1940s  and  1950s,  you  would  only  get  18  hours.  Now
we  let  people  know  when  hurricanes  are  coming  days  in  advance.
They  have  a  chance  to  pack  up  their  stuff  and  move  if  they  need
to  or  batten  down  wherever  they  need  to.  So  this  space  technology
is  protecting  lives  every  day,  especially  during  the  summer  hurri-
cane season on planet Earth.

Mr. BONNER. Well, as someone who experienced one of those hur-
ricanes  in  my  back  yard,  I  want  to  thank  you,  because  that  is  a
very  good  point.  We  were  able  to,  with  advanced  notice,  avoid  the
loss of life that we saw, for instance, in the tsunami. So thank you
both for what you do and for what you have done.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. Costa.

ISS CONFIGURATION AND SCHEDULE

Mr.  COSTA.  Thank  you  very  much.  And  I  am  not  sure  if  this
question  is  appropriately  addressed  to  Dr.  Whitson  or  Lieutenant
Colonel  Fincke.  What  I  asked  Dr.  Phillips  about  the  level  of  com-
pletion  of  the  Space  Station  currently,  I  thought  he  said  approxi-
mately  40  percent  plus.  What  is  the  exact  level  of  completion  cur-
rently  today?  And  it  goes  to  my  larger  question  that  is  under  the
timeline  that  we  are  currently  looking  at  when  the—hopefully  the
Shuttle becomes operative again here in the next couple of months,
when do we believe that we will be able to complete the Space Sta-
tion to then have the full complement of the six persons on the Sta-
tion and to be able to take advantage of all of the capacity that is—
we  hope  is  built  into  the  Station  to  perform  not  only  the  science
but the additional research that has been contemplated?

Dr.  WHITSON.  It  will  take  approximately  six  Shuttle  flights  to
complete  the  assembly  of  the  truss  element,  which  holds  the  solar

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 07:13 Dec 08, 2005 Jkt 021710 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\061405\21710 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

rays on either end. And that capability will allow us to add on the
different  laboratory—the  two  additional  laboratory  modules  and
then  connecting  node  modules.  So  there  will  be  three  more  addi-
tional large modules in addition to the six already on orbit.

Mr. COSTA. So that is nine Shuttle flights?
Dr. WHITSON. Yes.
Mr. COSTA. Okay.
Dr. WHITSON. Yes.
Mr. COSTA. Over what length of time?
Dr.  WHITSON.  Well,  the  Shuttle  assembly  rate  is  something  that
I think a lot of folks are working on now, and we will do whatever
we feel is safe and——

Mr. COSTA. I understand that part. Yeah.
Dr.  WHITSON.  Well,  we  anticipate  that  we  will  also  be  having  to
provide the resupply. As John mentioned, we have very limited re-
source  capability.  The  Russian  Progress  vehicles  have  provided  a
lot of resupply capability, but if we want to increase the crew size,
we  are  going  to  be  required  to  provide  resupply  missions  as  well.
Mr.  COSTA.  So  it  sounds  like  approximately  14  or  15  Shuttle

Dr.  WHITSON.  Well,  I  think  we  will  take  that  question  for  the

record and get you an official answer on that.

Mr.  COSTA.  And  if  we  are  doing  how  many  a  year—we  hope  to

be doing a year——

flights.

Dr. WHITSON. Hopefully——
Mr. COSTA. Six?
Dr.  WHITSON.  Yeah,  five  to  six  would  be,  I  think,  a  good  esti-

mate, but I think there is a lot of——

Mr.  COSTA.  So  we  are  talking  about  a  three-  to  four-year  period,

at least, to complete the Station?

Dr. WHITSON. At least, yes.
Mr.  COSTA.  Once  we  become  operational  with  Shuttle.  And  then
after  it  is  complete,  how  long  do  we  believe  that  the  Station  will
be able to perform at that level?

Dr.  WHITSON.  Well,  it  is  going  to  depend  a  lot  on  the  mainte-
nance  resupply  capability  that  we  have  provided  at  that  point,  be-
cause we will have to provide capability to repair the hardware on
orbit.

Mr. COSTA. And do you have cost estimates?
Dr. WHITSON. I am not familiar with——
Mr. COSTA. Okay.
Dr. WHITSON.—those numbers.
Mr. COSTA. I would like to submit that, for the record, Mr. Chair-

man, as well.

Chairman CALVERT. Without objection.
Mr. COSTA. Thank you. I defer—yield the balance of my time.
Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. Rohrabacher.

ISS RESUPPLY

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, let us hope we aren’t that dependent on
the Shuttle, because at $1 billion a flight, I guess that would mean
we  are  not  going  anywhere.  But  when  we  talk  about  resupply,  we

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 07:13 Dec 08, 2005 Jkt 021710 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\061405\21710 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

38

are  not  really  thinking  that  the  Shuttle  is  going  to  be  the  instru-
ment for resupply, are we?

Dr.  WHITSON.  We  can  take  that  question  for  the  record,  too,  but
I  think  there  are  lots  of  different  plans  out  there  for  alternatives.
With  the  ATV  module  being  built  by  the  Europeans  and  the  HTV
module being built by the Japanese, we have lots of options.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Realizing that perhaps these nine flights that
you  spoke  about,  for  the  completion  of  Space  Station,  that  is  the
only  vehicle  we  have  that  can  handle  that  kind  of  load,  but  when
it comes to resupply, might not the private sector be able to be con-
tracted  in  other  craft  that  cost  us  less  than  $1  billion  a  flight,  not
counting  what  the  cargo  is  that  is  in  there?  Might  we  go  to  that
direction and be able to do more with less?

Dr. WHITSON. And we will take that question for the record, also,
but I do know that the program is working on various alternatives
that do include commercial resupply.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  All  right.  And  about  your  bone  loss,  six  per-
cent. You lost six percent of your bone mass when you were—would
that also happen on the Moon?

Lieutenant  Colonel  FINCKE.  Well,  the—sir,  we  are  not  exactly
sure.  We  think  it  will  be  diminished  on  the  Moon,  because  there
is  gravity.  Gravity  on  the  Moon  is  roughly  about  one-sixth  on  the
Earth,  and  we  think  that  the  reason  why  we  are  losing  some  of
that  kind  of  bone  is  because  we  are  not  stimulating  our  muscles
and  our  bone  by  walking.  And  that  is  mainly  where  we  lose  it  is
in  our  hips.  And  so  by  having  a  chance  to  walk  on  the  Moon,  we
may  be  able  to  trick  our  bodies  into  thinking  to  get  more—to  con-
tinue,  but  we  don’t  know  that  for  sure.  But  when  we  go  to  the
Moon,  that  is  definitely,  I  think,  one  of  the  things  we  will  learn.
And  the  gravity  on  Mars  is  one-third,  so  maybe  there  is  another
equation there.

RESUPPLY: ISS VS. MOON

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, like we say, we have—the most—one of
the  most  important  contributions  of  Space  Stations  is  learning
about how to live in space, and this is our first step of humankind
living  in  space.  The  next  step  we  see,  the  President  has  outlined
this  plan  very  well,  and  I,  of  course,  commend  the  Administration
on—finally, after so long, in so many years presenting to us a strat-
egy, a long-term strategy. The President’s next step in his strategy
for  space  is  the  Moon.  And  when  we  talked  about  resupply  for  the
Station,  how  expensive  it  is,  would  resupply  for  a  Moon  mission,
how would that compare to the cost for resupply for people who are
in Station?

Dr.  WHITSON.  Well,  I  am  not  dealing  with  the  budget  numbers
on  that,  but  I  think  what  this  opportunity  offers  us  is  the  lessons
we have learned that we have to build hardware at a much higher
level  of  maintainability,  you  know.  Our  requirements  for  resupply
have to be reduced. We can’t support Moon or Mars missions at the
same re-supply level that we are doing currently. And I think that
is  an  important  lesson.  And  where  we  can  try  and  reduce  that  is
something  that  we  are  practicing  on  board  the  Station  every  day.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  So  we  might  be  trying  to  find  things  on  the
Moon  that  we  could  actually  generate  power  from  or  find  water

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 07:13 Dec 08, 2005 Jkt 021710 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\061405\21710 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

sources,  et  cetera?  We  can  talk—I  am  sure  we  will—as  this  goes
on, we will be having hearings about the potential of water on the
Moon and other resources, but we are looking——

Chairman CALVERT. So we can export it to California.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  That  would  be  good.  This  is  the  man  who

made sure we had water for the last six years.

Lieutenant  Colonel  FINCKE.  But  if  I  may  add,  it  is  that  there  is
a  lot  of  oxygen  that  is  connected  in  the  regolith,  the  soil  on  the
Moon. And right now, in kind of like an X–Prize, NASA has set out
this  new  program  where  we  are  offering  a  reward  for  the  cleaver
team that can figure out how to use, perhaps, like solar energy and
get  that  oxygen  that  is  trapped  in  the  minerals  on  the  Moon  so
that  we  won’t  need  to  send  up  oxygen,  that  we  would  be  able  to
use the resources on the Moon. So NASA is trying to be innovative
in trying to figure out how we can live off the land as best we can.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  That  is  just  the  type  of  creative  approach
that we are applauding your new Director for, and we expect to see
more of that from him and are very happy that—when people come
up with those kinds of ideas, because the cost to resupply, we can’t
be spending $1 billion a flight for the Shuttle and expect us to have
a space program all based on $1 billion a flight, and that’s just the
cost  of  the  transportation.  We  have  got  to  get  these  costs  under
control  and  find  some  creative  ways  of  accomplishing  the  mission
in a more cost-effective way.

So  thanks  for  throwing  that  in,  Colonel,  and  thank  you  very

much, Mr. Chairman.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
Mr.  Wu,  from  Oregon.  We  will  try  to  get  some  water  out  of  you,

too.

ISS CONFIGURATION AND SHUTTLE LAUNCH RATES

Mr.  WU.  Well,  we  Oregonians  think  that  California  ought  to  be
able to get all of the water that California wants. We will just peg
it to the price of a gallon of gasoline, and we are happy to sell how-
ever much California can buy, Mr. Chairman.

I  want  to  follow  up  on  the  questioning  of  Mr.  Rohrabacher  and
Mr. Costa. I was just doing, you know, a quick back-of-the-envelop
calculation  based  on  Dr.  Whitson’s  answers  about  how  many  lift
missions it would take to complete the International Space Station,
and  then—well,  it  seems  to  me  that  if  you  count  up  the  number
of missions and the mission rate, assuming five or six missions per
year, we are pretty much hard up against the 2010 retirement date
that the Administrator has said. Is that roughly correct?

Dr. WHITSON. Well, 2010 is the date that we are working to, and
there  are  groups  that  are  now  doing  assessments  and  analyzing
what  would  be  the  best  final  configuration  for  the  Station.  And  so
I  think  you  will  be  getting  some  answers  from  NASA  later  in  the
summer  on  what  that  configuration  will  be  and  how  we  could  do
that.

Mr.  WU.  But  what  I  am  concerned  about  the  2010  constraint
being  something  that,  A,  shapes  the  International  Space  Station,
whether  that  would  be  an  appropriate  or  inappropriate  limitation
on  the  International  Space  Station,  and  B,  that  the  2010  date,
aside  from  its  effect  on  the  International  Space  Station,  also  be-

40

comes  a  push  date  for  the  crew  exploration  vehicle.  And  in  my
readback  of  the  history  of  the  space  program  in  the  1960s  is  that
because we were in a race with the Russians, the types of vehicles
that  we  used  took  a  certain  shape,  and  that  became  a  limitation
of  you  all  going  forward,  because  we  were  in  a  hurry.  And  I  am
concerned  that  the  same  kind  of  hurry  about  the  crew  exploration
vehicle  will  perhaps  be  a  limitation  on  that  vehicle  going  forward.
Chairman CALVERT. I might point out to the gentleman that the
astronaut  corps  is  probably  not  prepared  to  answer  policy  ques-
tions, but I appreciate the gentleman asking.

Mr.  WU.  Well,  one  thing  that  I  have  found  is  that  if  you  ask
lower  in  the  organization,  sometimes  the  people  doing  the  rowing
will  give  you  more  accurate  answers  than  the  people  who  are
trained to deal with the public, if you will.

Dr. WHITSON. Well, I definitely think there is another group that
is working on the crew—our new crew vehicle, and they are trying
to  take  all  of  those  lessons  that  we  learned  in  the  early  programs
into account and trying to make fewer mistakes. That is part of our
hope  and  goal  is  to  make  fewer  mistakes  than  we  made  the  first
time  around  and  to  come  out  more  successful  than  we  have  even
in  the  past.  So  I  anticipate  that  NASA  will  have  a  plan  for  you
later this summer on what we think we will be able to do.

Mr.  WU.  Well,  Lieutenant  Colonel  Fincke,  Dr.  Whitson,  Mr.
Chairman,  I  want  to  support  your  efforts  fully,  but  I  also  want  to
state for the record that I am concerned about artificial constraints,
be  they  of  a  date  or  other  nature,  and  how  those  constraints  can
shape  the  Space  Station  or  shape  future  space  exploration.  And  I
just  want  to  lay  that  out  there,  not  as  an  item  of  concern  for  you
all, but as, really, an item of support for what your mission should
be  in  the  long-term  is  if  there  is  anything  that  I  have  observed
from my student days to the present is that there is nothing quite
as  permanent  as  temporary  solutions,  and  they—you  tend  to  rely
on  them  for  a  lot  longer  than  one  expects  to  when  first  going  in.
And you all and your successors wind up, you know, having to live
with that—with those constraints.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. WU. I yield back my time.
Chairman CALVERT. Mr. Feeney from Florida.

CHALLENGES OF HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT

Mr. FEENEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And  for  both  Dr.  Whitson  and  Lieutenant  Colonel  Fincke,  with
respect  to  the  expertise  that  you  uniquely  have  as  astronauts  on
the physiological impacts of space travel in low Earth orbit, do you
have  some  experiences  or  guess  about  what  that  portends  for  the
future of mid Earth orbit or high Earth orbit for human beings? We
have got lots of technological challenges. We have talked a little bit
about the exercise to levels. I know we are doing some experiments
on  the  current  Expedition  11  astronauts  when  they  get  back,  but
based  on  your  experience  so  far,  do  you  have  some  scientific  chal-
lenges  that  you  can  help  us  deal  with,  or  do  you  just  have  some
good  guesstimates  of  problems  that  we  are  going  to  face  as  we
move into further mid and outer Earth orbit?

Dr.  WHITSON.  Well,  the  human  body  responds  very  individually
unfortunately  for  us,  because  it  would  be  so  much  easier  for  us  to
answer  the  question  with  one  person.  Mike’s  experience  on  bone
loss  was  very  different  from  mine.  I  lost  no  overall  bone  density
during  my  space  flight,  but  I  had  a  different  exercise  regime.  And
so  we  are  learning  from  that.  Maybe  it  was  the  exercise.  Maybe  it
was something else as part of what we were doing during the mis-
sion.  We  have  to  pick  those  pieces  apart  to  find  out  the  best  solu-
tions  to  going  further  out  to  the  Moon  and  Mars.  I  think  we  are
well on our way. We have seen a lot of promise, and we are getting
the information and data that we need to make the conclusions and
to develop the right procedures to protect and minimize our bodies
against  those  risks  in  space.  But  there  are  lots  of  things  we  have
to work on, the radiation we talked about before. We have to have
exercise  hardware  that  is  reliable  enough  to  get  us  all  of  the  way
there  and  back  and  so  that  when  we  get  to  the  Moon  or  Mars  we
have that capability to perform well once we are there.

Lieutenant Colonel FINCKE. That is the—we are—we don’t think
we have the bone loss problem licked, but we think we have a good
handle  on  it.  We  understand  it.  The  radiation  shielding,  that  is
something  we  are—that  is  a  little  bit  right  now  a  long  pole  in  the
tent, and we are spending efforts appropriately to try to figure that
out,  how  to  come  up  with  radiation  shields  that  don’t  weigh  a  lot,
because  every  kilogram,  every  pound  that  you  send  up  costs  a  lot
of  money.  And  that  is  one  of  the  tricks,  especially  as  we  get  out
of  low  Earth  orbit  and  away  from  our  magnetosphere  that  we  are
really going to have to understand, and we are working towards it.
And hopefully there is going to be some things that we learn about
these  lightweight  radiation  shields  that  we  are  going  to  come  up
with that will be applicable for radiation shielding that we need on
the  ground,  because  every  hospital  I  know  has  an  x-ray  machine
and things like that, and maybe there are some things that we can
feed back into our industry.

FUTURE CEV DESIGNS

Mr.  FEENEY.  One  of  the  things  I  am  excited  about  the  new  Ad-
ministrator’s  proposal  is  to  shorten  the  window  or  eliminate  it
when we are out of manned space flight from the original proposal
of  2010  to  2014  and  maybe  have  no  window  at  all,  which  I  am  ex-
cited  about.  But  the  challenge  is  to  design  and  then  produce  the
right CEV to replace the Shuttle and to do some more types of mis-
sions that are more flexible and more—with different and more ex-
citing  capabilities  for  outer  Earth  orbit.  What  do  your  experiences,
including  the  exercise,  including  the  psychological  impacts  as  well
as  the  physiological,  what  do  they  tell  you  about  the  way,  if  you
were  a  designer,  you  would  try  to  design  the  next  living  quarters?
Obviously,  you  would  like  to  be  floating  around  in  a  comfortable
RV  with  a  TV  and  all  of  the  rest  of  it,  but  given  the  reasonable
limitations, what do your experiences tell you designers ought to be
thinking about?

Lieutenant  Colonel  FINCKE.  One  thing  in  the  psychological  area,
we  just  like  having  a  telephone.  It  was  really  important.  I  talked
to my wife once or twice a day, not for a long period of time, I was
busy,  but  it  was  still  just  being  able  to  say  hi,  especially  with  our

new baby that came. And being able to be able to still be in contact
with  your  friends  and  family  while  you  are  in  low  Earth  orbit  or
high  Earth  orbit  or  on  the  Moon  is  going  to  be  important.  It  is
going  to  be  a  little  trickier  when  you  go  to  Mars,  but  just  having
something  as  simple  as  that,  because  it  doesn’t  cost  very  much
mass to put a voice-over IP telephone on with your communication
system.  That  doesn’t  even  cost  that  much  money.  I  can  get  one  at
home  really  cheap.  It  is  one  of  these  things  that  makes  a  big  dif-
ference  yet  it  doesn’t  cost  very  much  in  terms  of  time  and  money.
And  that  is  a—those  are  the  kinds  of  things  that  we  are  learning
aboard Space Station, what we really need and the things that we
don’t need. Exercise equipment, boy, that is definitely an important
thing,  and  we  had  some  really  good  ideas  going  into  it,  and  now
we  are—we  have  learned  from  it,  and  we  are  moving—you  know,
making improvements onto the next series of designs.

Mr. FEENEY. Well, you should run for Congress. A lot of us spend

half our time avoiding the telephone here on terra firma.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
MICROGRAVITY RESEARCH

I  have  one  question.  The  issue  of  the  problems  with  gravity  and
you  are  saying  you  need  to  understand  that.  But  we  really  don’t
understand  microgravity,  do  we,  because  we  haven’t  been  able  to
do, really, any experiments of any note, as far as I know, in on the
International Space Station, is that true?

Dr.  WHITSON.  Actually,  during  my  mission,  the  zeolite  crystal
growth  experiment  that  I  had  conducted  was  actually  done  in  a
special  rack  called  the  ARIS,  Active  Rack  Isolation.  And  it  has  got
accelerometers  that  null  out.  And  so  basically,  the  rack  itself  was
floating inside the Space Station, which is, of course, going around
the  Earth.  And  it  has  got  accelerometers  on  it  to  null  out  any  vi-
brations  from  the  Station  itself  and  to  optimize,  in  that  particular
case,  the  crystal  formation  that  we  were  looking  for.  So  we  have
had  a  limited  capability  there  with  individual  racks  and  experi-
ments within those racks and those special racks.

Chairman  CALVERT.  How  about  upon  organisms,  on  living  orga-
nisms?  Have  there  been  any  experiments  on  microgravity  on—as
far as the effects of, say, as you mentioned one-third gravity, which
you  would  have  on—or  one-sixth  gravity  that  you  would  have  on
the  Moon  or  the  one-third  gravity  that  you  would  have  on  Mars,
whether  it  has  a  zero  effect  as  far  as  bone  loss  or  no  effect  at  all?
I mean, have there——

Dr. WHITSON. No.
Chairman  CALVERT.—been  any  experiments  on  any  of  that  at

Dr.  WHITSON.  Not  to  this  point  there  have  not  been  any  experi-
ments.  It  was  planned  to  have  those  experiments  conducted  when
we get the Centrifuge Accommodation Module up on board.

Chairman CALVERT. Now that is where I was——
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Will the Chairman—excuse me.
Chairman  CALVERT.  That  is  where  I  was  just  moving  toward.  Is
the  Centrifuge,  I  believe  that  is  in  conjunction  with  the  Japanese,
as far as you know, going ahead?

all?

Dr. WHITSON. As far as I know.
Chairman CALVERT. As far as you know? Okay.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Would the Chairman yield?
Chairman CALVERT. Sure.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much.
When  the  Space  Station  docks  with  their—you  know,  you  noted
that we have a number of resupply missions that are required, and
every  time  there  is  a  docking  required,  does  this  or  does  this  not
interfere with some of these microgravity experiments that are tak-
ing place and will take place on the Station? What have we noted?
Dr.  WHITSON.  We  actually  do  have  hardware  that  monitors  and
calibrates  the  vibrations  on  board  the  Space  Station,  some  specific
for the docking events and large events like that, but we also have
a continuous monitoring at various frequency levels so we can mon-
itor what the environment is. And it has been interesting, because
we  have  found  some  interesting  results  relative  to  that  in  some  of
our exercise activities that have been going on. So we are learning
as we go along where we might be perturbing the microgravity en-
vironment  on  board  the  Station.  As  I  mentioned,  we  have  the  spe-
cific  area  that  was  specifically  designed  for  those  microgravity  ex-
periments where it is very important and key not to have those vi-
brations interfere.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  And  thus  we  have  overcome  by  those  protec-
tions that we you are talking about, we have overcome the jolt that
might take place with a——

Dr. WHITSON. Yeah. It minimizes those effects dramatically. Yes.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  All  right.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chair-

man.

Chairman CALVERT. Thank you.
Well,  with  that,  I  want  to  thank  you,  Dr.  Whitson  and  Lieuten-
ant  Colonel  Fincke,  for  your  attendance  here  today  and,  of  course,
Dr. Phillips, who came from—to us from outer space. It was an ex-
citing hearing and historic, I understand the first time we have ac-
tually had a hearing and heard from our—or heard from a witness
from outer space. So this was a new and exciting thing.

Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Chairman, if I could, I have a point of personal
privilege.  I  was  speaker  of  the  Florida  House  when  we  had  the
Shuttle  astronauts  actually  take  questions  from  Governor  Bush,
Lieutenant  Governor  Brogan,  and  the  House  Speaker,  who  hap-
pened to be me at the time.

Chairman  CALVERT.  Well,  Florida  is  ahead,  once  again,  of  the
rest  of  us  in  the  country,  and  so—but  this  is  the  first  time  in  the
U.S. House of Representatives, I suspect.

But with that, I thank you, and we appreciate your commitment
and  dedication  to  this  country,  and  we  look  forward  to  hearing
from you in the future.

With that, we are adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 3:30 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]
