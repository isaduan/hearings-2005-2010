AIRLINE  FINANCIAL  STABILITY 

WEDNESDAY,  JULY  13,  2005 

U.S. SENATE, 

SUBCOMMITTEE ON AVIATION, 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  9:58  a.m.,  Senate 
Russell  253,  Hon.  Conrad  Burns,  Chairman  of  the  Subcommittee, 
presiding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CONRAD BURNS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA 

Senator  BURNS.  We’ll  call  the  Committee  to  order  this  morning, 
and  there  are  quite  a  lot  of  things  going  on  in  this  part  of  the 
world, and we want to thank our folks for coming in this morning. 
I welcome this panel of witnesses, and especially in our continuing 
efforts  to  work  toward  ideas  for  the  next  FAA  reauthorization  bill, 
we are examining the financial condition of the airline industry. It 
is  our  intent  to  focus  on  a  wide  array  of  internal  and  external  fac-
tors that shape the industry today. I think it’s important this sub-
committee  understands  the  underlying  principles,  and  problems  in 
the  industry  in  order  to  make  an  educated  policy  decision.  As  you 
know,  as  policymakers,  we  should  operate  with  the  idea  to  do  no 
harm,  and  when  we  do  know  there  are  extenuating  circumstances 
under legislation and sometimes we don’t see it coming. 

There  are  certainly  several  caveats  to  the  airline  industry.  I  an-
ticipate  that  we  will  discuss  them,  among  others,  the  relationship 
between the legacy carriers and the low-cost carriers, so-called ris-
ing fuel costs, aviation taxes and fees, labor and management rela-
tions, capacity concerns, fair pricing, aircraft leasing, industry con-
solidation, and the role that Chapter 11 bankruptcy plays in the in-
dustry.  As  if  there  is  not  enough  on  the  platter  already,  this  sort 
of fills the boat. 

Since  2000,  many  in  the  airline  industry  have  experienced  poor 
financial  results  and  have  lost  somewhere  around  $35  billion  with 
the expectation of heavy losses this year. A majority of those prob-
lems  can  be  traced  back  to  the  horrific  events  of  9/11  and  SARS, 
but  there  are  also  several  factors  that  were  in  place,  and  starting 
to evolve prior to 9/11. 

Legacy  carriers—the  business  models—have  been  criticized  for 
years, but the fragile line between profitability and red ink was not 
exposed  until  we  had  seen  the  events  of  9/11,  and  the  effects  of 
that  along  with  the  downturn  of  the  overall  economy.  One  could

argue that we are starting to see the actual results of deregulation 
now much more than the 1980s and 1990s. 

We  now  have  prospering,  low-cost  carriers,  evolving  business, 
and  aviation  ventures,  and  because  of  it,  more  people  are  flying 
today.  In  fact,  just  last  month  we  had  a  hearing  on  passenger  lev-
els and system capacity. Our traffic levels are back to record levels, 
planes  are  full,  but  many  of  the  legacy  carriers  are  still  seriously 
struggling. 

It’s  tough  to  understand  why,  in  a  business  that  seems  to  be 
booming,  most  of  the  legacy  carriers  are  busting.  For  a  Senator 
from Montana, it’s even more disconcerting to see our legacy tradi-
tional  hub-and-spoke  carriers  in  dire  straits.  The  hub-and-spoke 
model  has  provided  historical  foundation  for  rural  access  to  my 
state  and  many  others  that  do  not  fit  into  the  traditional  low-cost 
carrier business plan. Legacy carriers are making significant gains 
in  improving  their  bottom  lines,  but  still  reporting  large  financial 
losses. Today we look at some of the reasons why. 

Our  panel  consists  of  a  broad  spectrum  of  aviation  experts,  and 
I  look  forward  to  their  testimony.  This  morning  I  want  to  thank 
them for coming, because we know the industry is vitally important 
to  this  country  for  commerce  and  I  know  you  take  your  job  very, 
very seriously. Senator Inouye, thank you for coming in this morn-
ing, also. 

STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

Senator INOUYE. Well, I thank you very much. I have a prepared 
statement  I’d  like  to  have  made  part  of  the  record.  Like  a  few  of 
my  colleagues,  I  do  a  lot  of  flying.  In  fact,  last  week,  I  spent  more 
time in the air than on the ground. I spent 20 hours in Hawaii and 
22 hours in the air. And so I’m well aware of the low fares. I’m well 
aware  of  the  packed  aircraft,  and,  yet,  I  know  that  since  2001,  we 
have  a  shortfall  of  $35  billion.  About  150,000  have  lost  their  jobs, 
so  this  is  a  serious  situation,  and  we  are  looking  for  answers,  and 
I would like to commend my Chairman for calling this hearing. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Inouye follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 
Most  aviation  observers  understand  that  despite  the  low  fares  and  packed  air-
planes  that  have  become  commonplace,  the  Nation’s  airlines  continue  to  struggle 
through the toughest financial period in the history of commercial aviation. This has 
not been a blip on the proverbial radar screen. 

This  has  been  an  extended  economic  slump  that  resulted  in  the  collective  loss  of 
tens of billions of dollars by the major carriers and the elimination of nearly 150,000 
airline jobs over the past four years. 

Most  Americans  recognize  how  important  a  healthy  aviation  industry  is  for  a 
country  as  large  as  the  U.S.  However,  it  is  often  easy  to  forget  the  complex  factors 
affecting our airlines, particularly, when planes generally run on schedule and move 
passengers  thousands  of  miles  in  a  fraction  of  the  time  that  other  modes  require. 
In  my  home  State  of  Hawaii,  the  service  air  carriers  provide  is  vital  to  our  way 
of  life.  Hawaii  residents  use  planes  as  a  primary  mode  of  transportation.  Many  do 
so on a daily basis as part of their commute to and from work. 

Whether travel, tourism, or trade, in Hawaii, we depend on the commercial avia-
tion industry to provide us with timely contact between the islands, the continental 
U.S.,  and  the  rest  of  the  world.  Yet  our  two  primary  airlines,  Hawaiian  and  Aloha, 
have  operated  under  bankruptcy  protection  for  much  of  the  past  two  years.  Their 
precarious  financial  situation  has  constantly  threatened  significant  service  disrup-
tions, which would be devastating to the local economy.

Hawaii primarily counts on major carriers for service beyond our borders, and like 

our local carriers, these airlines are facing great financial difficulties. 

When  the  Federal  Government  shut  down  the  Nation’s  airspace  for  several  days 
following  the  9/11  attacks,  most  Americans  experienced  a  temporary  limit  to  their 
mobility in the wake of the tragedy. For the people of Hawaii, the shutdown directly 
and  immediately  impacted  their  livelihoods.  For  those  needing  medical  assistance 
or facing subsequent emergencies, it became a matter of life or death. 

There  are  many  rural  or  isolated  communities  that  could  face  similar  cir-
cumstances  if  a  local  airline  fails  or  their  access  to  the  National  Airspace  System 
is  reduced  in  the  wake  of  extreme  cost-cutting  measures.  In  a  globalized  economy 
reliant upon air travel, the impact to rural communities could be increasingly detri-
mental.  We  must  continually  work  to  ensure  that  all  of  our  citizens  have  a  fair  op-
portunity to access this nation’s unparalleled aviation infrastructure. 

I  wish  to  take  this  opportunity  to  recognize  the  employees  in  the  aviation  indus-
try. They have been especially resilient during this difficult period. They have seen 
nearly one-third of all airline jobs eliminated, and virtually every employee has seen 
their  pay  and  benefits  reduced.  They  understand  intimately  the  importance  of  this 
industry and have gone above and beyond to see that it survives. 

Unfortunately, if we do not begin to solve the problems plaguing the air carriers, 
we  will  see  more  failures  in  coming  months  and  certainly  more  jobs  cut.  The  com-
bination  of  excess  capacity,  record  gas  prices,  and  a  market  flush  with  consistent, 
low  fares  has  effectively  neutralized  the  major  carriers’  intense,  cost-cutting  meas-
ures.  The  Bush  Administration’s  effort  to  add  additional  security  and  pension  fees 
has not been helpful either. 

The  U.S.  airline  industry  is  now  at  a  crossroad.  Some  legacy  carriers  have  spent 
the last few years aggressively working to compete will the budget carriers and are 
now approaching profitability. They are beginning to prove that they can adapt and 
survive.  Yet  at  the  same  time,  factors  like  spiraling  gas  prices  are  pushing  others 
to the brink of bankruptcy or limiting their ability to get out of it. 

The financial stability of the airlines is one of the most important issues that we 
face  this  session.  We  must  carefully  consider  the  needs  of  the  industry  as  a  whole, 
make  certain  that  urban,  suburban,  and  rural  communities  can  access  air  travel, 
and advance forward-thinking initiatives that will help ensure a prosperous, vibrant 
aviation industry for decades to come. 

Senator  BURNS.  Thank  you  very  much,  Senator,  and  your  full 
statement will be made part of the record. We’ll just take the panel 
now this morning. As it’s listed here, Ms. JayEtta Z. Hecker, Direc-
tor  of  Physical  Infrastructure  Issues,  U.S.  Government  Accounting 
Office,  GAO,  and  we  welcome  you  this  morning  and  look  forward 
to  your  testimony.  By  the  way,  we  would  like  to  condense  some  of 
this. You bring up the highlights and then we’ll put your full state-
ment in the record. Thank you. 

STATEMENT OF JAYETTA Z. HECKER, DIRECTOR, 

PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES, 

U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE 

Ms.  HECKER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Senator  Inouye,  I’m 
very pleased to be here today. As you know, we’ve been conducting 
analyses  of  the  airline  industry  at  the  direction  of  Congress  for  a 
number of years. We had a prior report last year that talked about 
the  factors  that  were  leading  to  the  extremely  difficult  financial 
condition.  The  current  work  that  I’m  reporting  on  is  focusing  on 
bankruptcy  and  pension  issues  in  airlines  and  my  remarks—I  do 
have a slide presentation. I don’t know if you have that. It may be 
useful because I have a number of charts that I think tell the story. 
Senator  BURNS.  We  all  have  copies,  I  think,  and  as  you  know, 

this is a technology committee, of which we have none. 

Ms. HECKER. Hopefully paper will work in this instance. The two 
topics are the financial difficulties faced by the legacy carriers and 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:42 Nov 17, 2010 Jkt 062179 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\62179.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

4 

the  major  factors  behind  them,  and  then  the  effect  of  bankruptcy 
on the industry and competitors. 

On  the  first  topic,  there  is,  of  course,  no  secret  that  the  airlines 
face  severe  financial  difficulties.  There  has  been  not  only  the  sig-
nificant  change  in  demand,  particularly  the  increased  price  sensi-
tivity  of  business  travelers,  but  there  have  also  been  enormous 
changes  in  the  competitive  environment  where  low-cost  carriers 
now are available to 85 percent of all passengers. The low-cost car-
riers  are  really  the  price  setters  and  have  transformed  their  com-
petitive environment in the airline industry. 

This  really  has  led  to  the  major  effort  by  the  legacy  carriers  to 
control  costs,  and  the  next  slide,  the  one  with  the  two  lines,  basi-
cally  outlines  the  changes  in  the  costs  for  available  seat-miles  for 
both the legacy carriers and the low-cost carriers, and you see they 
were  going  up  until  2001,  and  then  both  were  coming  down,  but 
the  main  point  is  that  the  difference  has  actually  increased,  so  as 
the low-cost carriers have continued to expand, their costs-per-seat- 
mile  have  actually  gone  down,  and  the  difference—the  cost  dis-
advantage—has  actually  increased,  and  you  see  the  factors  there, 
labor, pensions, fuel, and a wide variety of other factors. 

Of  course,  the  next  page  shows  the  fuel  prices,  and  there  is  no 
doubt  the  prior  page  said  that  the  difference,  this  is  not  the  total 
fuel,  but  the  difference  in  the  fuel  costs  for  low-cost  carriers,  they 
actually  had  a  fuel  advantage,  more  fuel  efficient  airplanes  and 
more  efficient  use  of  airplanes,  so  all  of  the  costs  have  been  hurt 
by  these  rising  prices,  but,  of  course,  on  a  differential  basis.  My 
main  point  is  really  this  next  chart  about  fixed  obligations,  and 
what  is  important  here  is  its  absence  of  the  liquidity  that  really 
drives  carriers  into  bankruptcy,  along  with  inability  to  renegotiate 
obligations and acquire new capital. 

The first column is the cash on hand at the end of 2004 and then 
the next four bars basically outline the fixed obligations. These are 
fixed.  These  are  not  flexible  with  changing  your  business  model, 
and how they severely strain and overpower the amount of cash on 
hand. The other thing is to see how diverse these factors are. There 
has been a lot of talk about pensions. Pensions is only one-sixth of 
the  fixed  obligation  overhang  that  is  so  threatening  the  financial 
condition of the major carriers. 

The second objective, then, is to look at the whole issue of bank-
ruptcy. There is widespread expectation of presumption that bank-
ruptcy  was  used  to  harm  competitors  by  either  lowering  prices  or 
keeping  capacity  in  the  market  longer.  Our  first  chart  on  page  8 
basically  outlines  how  bankruptcy  and  liquidations  are  more  com-
mon  in  the  airline  industry.  In  fact,  the  airline  industry  is  one  of 
the  worst  performing  sectors  of  all,  and  what  we  have  here  is,  not 
only  is  the  rate  of  bankruptcy  and  liquidation  more  common,  but 
the potential to recover is also more difficult for carriers. 

Our  data  shows  that  of  160  bankruptcies  since  1978,  only  20 
have  actually  survived  to  this  day.  Another  factor  we  found  is  the 
airline  bankruptcies  last  longer,  and  as  I  said  have  these  less  suc-
cessful outcomes. The next, page 9, is this growth of airline indus-
try capacity and charted along with major airline liquidations, and 
the  point  here  is  that  we  found  little  evidence  that  bankruptcies 
are actually contributing to the overcapacity. As you see, it’s really 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:42 Nov 17, 2010 Jkt 062179 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\62179.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

5 

those gray areas, it’s the recessions that have been the only factors 
that lead to decreases in industry capacity. 

We  have  concluded  that  bankruptcies  are  not  looked  at  for  com-
petitive advantage. It’s not a panacea. It involves many costs, many 
risks,  and  in  our  view  is  looked  at  by  firms  as  a  last  resort.  And 
if anything, the poor history really is a testimony to that. 

Our  concluding  observations  then  is  that  we,  as  you  said,  Mr. 
Chairman,  the  industry  is  really  still  playing  out  the  deregulation 
policies  of  the  1970s.  The  restructuring  is  continuing.  The  emer-
gence,  the  full,  powerful,  ever  present  emergence  of  low-cost  car-
riers, as I said, is available to 85 percent of the population, and the 
legacy  carriers  profitability  depends  on  controlling  those  costs 
where they still have that disadvantage. 

An important part of our conclusion, contrary to what is seen as 
accepted  wisdom,  bankruptcy  and  liquidation  are  a  reflection  of, 
but  not  the  cause  of  industry  stability,  and  in  our  view,  some  car-
riers  will  terminate  pension  plans  through  the  bankruptcy  process 
under  the  current  conditions.  Our  most  focused  observation  is  this 
last  point,  though,  and  it’s  the  terminating  pensions  or  amortizing 
their  contributions  over  a  longer  period  will  not  solve  the  under-
lying  legacy  problems,  fundamental  structural  concerns  and  cost 
disadvantage,  so  even  though  there  may  be  a  potential  for  a  tem-
porary  reprieve,  it  is  only  a  limited  part  of  the  liquidity  problem, 
and the cost-differential, and, thus, in our view, there shouldn’t be 
a  sense  that  there  is  a  silver  bullet  to  somehow  fix  the  dire  finan-
cial  condition  of  the  legacy  carriers.  That  concludes  my  remarks, 
Mr. Chairman. 

[The prepared statement of Ms. Hecker follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JAYETTA Z. HECKER, DIRECTOR, 

PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE 
Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee: 
We  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  today’s  hearing  to  discuss  the  fi-
nancial  condition  of  the  U.S.  airline  industry—and  particularly,  the  financial  prob-
lems  of  legacy  airlines.1 Since  2001,  the  U.S.  airline  industry  has  confronted  finan-
cial  losses  of  unprecedented  proportions.  From  2001  through  2004,  legacy  airlines 
reported losses of $28 billion, and two of the nation’s largest legacy airlines—United 
Airlines and US Airways—went into bankruptcy,2 eventually terminating their pen-
sion plans, and passing the unfunded liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Cor-
poration  (PBGC).3 Two  other  large  legacy  airlines  have  announced  that  they  are 
precariously close to following suit. 

In recent years, considerable debate has ensued over legacy airlines’ use of Chap-
ter  11  bankruptcy  protection  as  a  means  to  continue  operations,  often  for  years. 
Some  in  the  industry  and  elsewhere  have  maintained  that  legacy  airlines’  use  of 
this  approach  is  harmful  to  the  airline  industry  as  a  whole,  in  that  it  allows  ineffi-
cient carriers to stay in business, exacerbating overcapacity and allowing these air-
lines  to  potentially  under-price  their  competitors.  This  debate  has  received  even 
sharper  focus  with  US  Airways’  and  United’s  defaults  on  their  pensions.  By  elimi-
nating  their  pension  obligations,  critics  argue,  US  Airways  and  United  enjoy  a  cost 
advantage  that  may  encourage  other  airlines  sponsoring  defined  benefits  plans  to 
take the same approach. 

Last  year,  we  reported  on  the  industry’s  poor  financial  condition,  the  reasons  for 
it,  and  the  necessity  of  legacy  airlines  to  reduce  their  costs  if  they  are  to  survive.4 
At the request of the Congress, we have continued to assess the financial condition 
of  the  airline  industry,  and,  in  particular,  the  problems  of  bankruptcy  and  pension 
terminations.  Our  work  in  this  area  is  still  under  way.5 Nonetheless,  we  can  offer 
some preliminary observations about what we are finding. Our statement today de-

will offer additional evidence and insights on these questions.

In summary: 
• U.S. legacy airlines have not been able to reduce their costs sufficiently to prof-
itably  compete  with  low-cost  airlines  that  continue  to  capture  industry  market 
share.  Challenges  that  are  internal  and  external  to  the  industry  have  fun-
damentally changed the nature of the industry and forced legacy airlines to re-
structure  themselves  financially.  The  changing  demand  for  air  travel  and 
growth  of  low-cost  airlines  has  kept  fares  low,  forcing  legacy  airlines  to  reduce 
their costs. However, legacy airlines have struggled to do so, and have been un-
able  to  achieve  unit-cost  comparability  with  their  low-cost  rivals.  As  a  result, 
legacy  airlines  have  continued  to  lose  money—$28  billion  since  2001—and  are 
expected  to  lose  another  $5  billion  in  2005.  Additionally,  airlines’  costs  have 
been hurt by rising fuel prices—especially legacy airlines that did not have fuel 
hedging in place. 

• Bankruptcies  are  endemic  to  the  airline  industry,  the  result  of  long-standing 
structural  issues  within  the  industry,  but  there  is  no  clear  evidence  that  bank-
ruptcy  itself  has  harmed  the  industry  or  its  competitors.  Since  deregulation  in 
1978, there have been 160 airline bankruptcy filings, 20 of which have occurred 
in the last 5 years. Airlines fail at a higher rate than most other types of com-
panies, and the airline industry historically has the worst financial performance 
of  any  sector.  This  inherent  instability  that  leads  to  so  many  bankruptcies  can 
be traced to the structure of the industry and its economics, including the high-
ly cyclical demand for air travel, high fixed costs, and few barriers to entry. The 
available evidence does not suggest that airlines in bankruptcy contribute to in-
dustry  overcapacity,  or  that  bankrupt  airlines  harm  competitors  by  reducing 
fares  below  what  other  airlines  are  charging.  The  history  of  the  industry  since 
deregulation  indicates  that  past  liquidations  or  consolidations  have  not  slowed 
the  overall  growth  of  capacity  in  the  industry.  Studies  conducted  by  others  do 
not show evidence that airlines operating in bankruptcy harmed other competi-
tors. Finally, while bankruptcy may appear to be a useful business strategy for 
companies  in  financial  distress,  available  analysis  suggests  it  provides  no  pan-
acea for airlines. Few airlines that have filed for bankruptcy protection are still 
in  business  today.  Bankruptcy  involves  many  costs,  and  given  the  poor  track 
record, companies are likely to use it only as a last resort. 

• While  bankruptcy  may  not  harm  the  financial  health  of  the  airline  industry,  it 
has become a considerable concern for the Federal Government and airline em-
ployees  and  retirees  because  of  the  recent  terminations  of  pensions  by  US  Air-
ways and United Airlines. These terminations resulted in claims on PBGC’s sin-
gle-employer  program  of  $9.6  billion  and  plan  participants  (i.e.,  employees,  re-
tirees, and beneficiaries) are estimated to have lost more than $5 billion in ben-
efits  that  were  either  not  covered  by  PBGC,  or  exceeded  the  statutory  limits. 
At  termination  in  May  2005,  United’s  pension  plans  promised  $16.8  billion  in 
benefits backed by only $7 billion in assets (i.e., it was underfunded by $9.8 bil-
lion).  PBGC  guaranteed  $13.6  billion  of  the  promised  benefits,  resulting  in  a 
claim on the agency of $6.6 billion and an estimated $3.2 billion loss to partici-
pants.  The  defined  benefit  pension  plans  of  the  remaining  legacy  airlines  with 
active  plans  are  underfunded  by  $13.7  billion  (based  on  data  from  the  U.S.  Se-
curities  and  Exchange  Commission,  or  SEC),  raising  the  potential  of  additional 
sizeable losses to PBGC and plan participants. These airlines face $10.4 billion 
in  pension  contributions  over  the  next  4  years,  significantly  more  than  some  of 
them  may  be  able  to  afford  given  continued  losses  and  their  other  fixed  obliga-
tions.  Spreading  these  contributions  over  more  years,  as  some  of  these  airlines 
have proposed, would relieve some of this liquidity pressure but would not nec-
essarily keep them out of bankruptcy because it does not fully address the fun-
damental cost structure problems faced by legacy airlines. 

Legacy Airlines Must Reduce Costs To Restore Profitability 

Since  2000,  legacy  airlines  have  faced  unprecedented  internal  and  external  chal-
lenges. Internally, the impact of the Internet on how tickets are sold and consumers 
search  for  fares  and  the  growth  of  low-cost  airlines  as  a  market  force  accessible  to 
almost every consumer has hurt legacy airline revenues by placing downward pres-
sure  on  airfares.  More  recently,  airlines’  costs  have  been  hurt  by  rising  fuel  prices 
(see  figure  1).6 This  is  especially  true  of  airlines  that  did  not  have  fuel  hedging  in 
place. Externally, a series of largely unforeseen events—among them the September 
11th  terrorist  attacks  in  2001  and  associated  security  concerns;  war  in  Iraq;  the

SARS  crisis;  economic  recession  beginning  in  2001;  and  a  steep  decline  in  business 
travel—seriously disrupted the demand for air travel during 2001 and 2002.

Low fares have constrained revenues for both legacy and low-cost airlines. Yields, 
the  amount  of  revenue  airlines  collect  for  every  mile  a  passenger  travels,  fell  for 
both  low-cost  and  legacy  airlines  from  2000  through  2004  (see  figure  2).  However, 
the  decline  has  been  greater  for  legacy  airlines  than  for  low-cost  airlines.  During 
the  first  quarter  of  2005,  average  yields  among  both  legacy  and  low-cost  airlines 
rose  somewhat,  although  those  for  legacy  airlines  still  trailed  what  they  were  able 
to earn during the same period in 2004. 

Legacy  airlines,  as  a  group,  have  been  unsuccessful  in  reducing  their  costs  to  be-
come  more  competitive  with  low-cost  airlines.  Unit  cost  competitiveness  is  key  to

profitability for airlines because of declining yields. While legacy airlines have been 
able  to  reduce  their  overall  costs  since  2001,  these  were  largely  achieved  through 
capacity  reductions  and  without  an  improvement  in  their  unit  costs.  Meanwhile, 
low-cost airlines have been able to maintain low unit costs, primarily by continuing 
to  grow.  As  a  result,  low-cost  airlines  have  been  able  to  sustain  a  unit  cost  advan-
tage  as  compared  to  their  legacy  rivals  (see  figure  3).  In  2004,  low-cost  airlines 
maintained  a  2.7  cent  per  available  seat-mile  advantage  over  legacy  airlines.  This 
advantage is attributable to lower overall costs and greater labor and asset produc-
tivity.  During  the  first  quarter  of  2005,  both  legacy  and  low-cost  airlines  continued 
to struggle to reduce costs, in part because of the increase in fuel costs. 

Weak  revenues  and  the  inability  to  realize  greater  unit  cost-savings  have  com-
bined  to  produce  unprecedented  losses  for  legacy  airlines.  At  the  same  time,  low- 
cost airlines have been able to continue producing modest profits as a result of lower 
unit  costs  (see  figure  4).  Legacy  airlines  have  lost  a  cumulative  $28  billion  since 
2001 and are predicted to lose another $5 billion in 2005, according to industry ana-
lysts.  First  quarter  2005  operating  losses  (based  on  data  reported  to  DOT)  ap-
proached  $1.45  billion  for  legacy  airlines.  Low  cost  airlines  also  reported  net  oper-
ating losses of almost $0.2 billion, driven primarily by ATA’s losses.

Since  2000,  as  the  financial  condition  of  legacy  airlines  deteriorated,  they  built 
cash  balances,  not  through  operations,  but  by  borrowing.  Legacy  airlines  have  lost 
cash from operations, and compensated for operating losses by taking on additional 
debt,  relying  on  creditors  for  more  of  their  capital  needs  than  in  the  past.  In  the 
process  of  doing  so,  several  legacy  airlines  have  used  all,  or  nearly  all,  of  their  as-
sets as collateral, potentially limiting their future access to capital markets. 

In  sum,  airlines  are  capital-  and  labor-intensive  firms  subject  to  highly  cyclical 
demand  and  intense  competition.  Aircraft  are  very  expensive  and  require  large 
amounts  of  debt  financing  to  acquire,  resulting  in  high  fixed-costs  for  the  industry. 
Labor  is  largely  unionized  and  highly  specialized,  making  it  expensive  and  hard  to 
reduce  during  downturns.  Competition  in  the  industry  is  frequently  intense  owing 
to  periods  of  excess  capacity,  relatively  open  entry,  and  the  willingness  of  lenders 
to provide financing. Finally, demand for air travel is highly cyclical, closely tied to 
the business cycle. Over the past decade, these structural problems have been exac-
erbated  by  the  growth  in  low-cost  airlines  and  increasing  consumer  sensitivity  to 
differences  in  airfares  based  on  their  use  of  the  Internet  to  purchase  tickets.  More 
recently, airlines have had to deal with persistently high fuel prices—operating prof-
itability, excluding fuel costs, is as high as it has ever been for the industry. 
Bankruptcy  Is  Common  in  the  Airline  Industry,  but  There  Is  No  Evidence 

That it Is Harmful to the Industry or Competitors 

Airlines seek bankruptcy protection for such reasons as severe liquidity pressures, 
an inability to obtain relief from employees and creditors, and an inability to obtain 
new  financing,  according  to  airline  officials  and  bankruptcy  experts.  As  a  result  of 
the  structural  problems  and  external  shocks  previously  discussed,  there  have  been 
160  total  airline  bankruptcy  filings  since  deregulation  in  1978,  including  20  since 
2000,  according  to  the  Air  Transport  Association.7 Some  airlines  have  failed  more 
than  once,  but  most  filings  were  by  smaller  carriers.  However,  the  size  of  airlines 
that have been declaring bankruptcy has been increasing. Of the 20 bankruptcy fil-
ings  since  2000,  half  of  these  have  been  for  airlines  with  more  than  $100  million 
in  assets,  about  the  same  number  of  filings  as  in  the  previous  22  years.  Compared 
to the average failure rate for all types of businesses, airlines have failed more often 
than  other  businesses.  As  figure  5  shows,  in  some  years,  airline  failures  were  sev-
eral times more common than for businesses overall.

With  very  few  exceptions,  airlines  that  enter  bankruptcy  do  not  emerge  from  it. 
Of the 146 airline Chapter 11 reorganization filings since 1979, in only 16 cases are 
the airlines still in business. Many of the advantages of bankruptcy stem from legal 
protection  afforded  the  debtor-airline  from  its  creditors,  but  this  protection  comes 
at  a  high  cost  in  loss  of  control  over  airline  operations  and  damaged  relations  with 
employees, investors, and suppliers, according to airline officials and bankruptcy ex-
perts. 

Contrary  to  some  assertions  that  bankruptcy  protection  has  led  to  overcapacity 
and  under-pricing  that  have  harmed  healthy  airlines,  we  found  no  evidence  that 
this  has  occurred  either  in  individual  markets  or  to  the  industry  overall.  Such 
claims  have  been  made  for  more  than  a  decade.  In  1993,  for  example,  a  national 
commission  to  study  airline  industry  problems  cited  bankruptcy  protection  as  a 
cause for the industry’s overcapacity and weakened revenues.8 More recently, airline 
executives  have  cited  bankruptcy  protection  as  a  reason  for  industry  over-capacity 
and low fares. However, we found no evidence that this had occurred and some evi-
dence to the contrary. 

First,  as  illustrated  by  Figure  6,  airline  liquidations  do  not  appear  to  affect  the 
continued  growth  in  total  industry  capacity.  If  bankruptcy  protection  leads  to  over-
capacity  as  some  contend,  then  liquidation  should  take  capacity  out  of  the  market. 
However,  the  historical  growth  of  airline  industry  capacity  (as  measured  by  avail-
able  seat-miles,  or  ASMs)  has  continued  unaffected  by  major  liquidations.  Only  re-
cessions,  which  curtail  demand  for  air  travel,  and  the  September  11th  attack,  ap-
pear  to  have  caused  the  airline  industry  to  trim  capacity.  This  trend  indicates  that 
other airlines quickly replenish capacity to meet demand. In part, this can be attrib-
uted to the fungibility of aircraft and the availability of capital to finance airlines.9

Similarly,  our  research  does  not  indicate  that  the  departure  or  liquidation  of  a 
carrier from an individual market necessarily leads to a permanent decline in traffic 
for that market. We contracted with InterVISTAS-ga2, an aviation consultant, to ex-
amine the cases of six hub cities that experienced the departure or significant with-
drawal of service of an airline over the last decade (see table 1). In four of the cases, 
both  local  origin-and-destination  (i.e.,  passenger  traffic  to  or  from,  but  not  con-
necting through, the local hub) and total passenger traffic (i.e., local and connecting) 
increased  or  changed  little  because  the  other  airlines  expanded  their  traffic  in  re-
sponse. In all but one case, fares either decreased or rose less than 6 percent.

We  also  reviewed  numerous  other  bankruptcy  and  airline  industry  studies  and 
spoke  to  industry  analysts  to  determine  what  evidence  existed  with  regard  to  the 
impact  of  bankruptcy  on  the  industry.  We  found  two  major  academic  studies  that 
provided empirical data on this issue. Both studies found that airlines under bank-
ruptcy protection did not lower their fares or hurt competitor airlines, as some have

contended. A 1995 study found that an airline typically reduced its fares somewhat 
before  entering  bankruptcy.  However,  the  study  found  that  other  airlines  did  not 
lower  their  fares  in  response  and,  more  importantly,  did  not  lose  passenger  traffic 
to  their  bankrupt  rival  and  therefore  were  not  harmed  by  the  bankrupt  airline.10 
Another  study  came  to  a  similar  conclusion  in  2000,  this  time  examining  the  oper-
ating  performance  of  51  bankrupt  firms,  including  5  airlines,  and  their  competi-
tors.11 Rather  than  examine  fares  as  did  the  1995  study,  this  study  examined  the 
operating  performance  of  bankrupt  firms  and  their  rivals.  This  study  found  that 
bankrupt  firms’  performance  deteriorated  prior  to  filing  for  bankruptcy  and  that 
their  rivals’  profits  also  declined  during  this  period.  However,  once  a  firm  entered 
bankruptcy, its rivals’ profits recovered. 
Legacy Airlines Face Significant Near-Term Liquidity Pressures, Including 

$10.4 Billion in Pensions Contributions Over the Next 4 Years 

Under  current  law,  legacy  airlines’  pension  funding  requirements  are  estimated 
to be a minimum of $10.4 billion from 2005 through 2008.12 These estimates assume 
the expiration of the Pension Funding Equity Act (PFEA) at the end of this year.13 
The  PFEA  permitted  airlines  to  defer  the  majority  of  their  deficit  reduction  con-
tributions  in  2004  and  2005;  if  this  legislation  is  allowed  to  expire  it  would  mean 
that payments due from legacy airlines will significantly increase in 2006. According 
to  PBGC  data,  legacy  airlines  are  estimated  to  owe  a  minimum  of  $1.5  billion  this 
year,  rising  to  nearly  $2.9  billion  in  2006,  $3.5  billion  in  2007,  and  $2.6  billion  in 
2008. In contrast, low-cost airlines have eschewed defined benefit pension plans and 
instead use defined-contribution (401k-type) plans. 

However, pension funding obligations are only part of the sizeable amount of debt 
that carriers face over the near term. The size of legacy airlines’ future fixed obliga-
tions, including pensions, relative to their financial position suggests they will have 
trouble meeting their various financial obligations. Fixed airline obligations (includ-
ing  pensions,  long-term  debt,  and  capital  and  operating  leases)  in  each  year  from 
2005  through  2008  are  substantial.  Legacy  airlines  carried  cash  balances  of  just 
under  $10  billion  going  into  2005  (see  figure  7)  and  have  used  cash  to  fund  their 
operational losses. These airlines fixed obligations are estimated to be over $15 bil-
lion in both 2005 and 2006, over $17 billion in 2007, and about $13 billion in 2008. 
While cash from operations can help fund some of these obligations, continued losses 
and the size of these obligations put these airlines in a sizable liquidity bind. Fixed 
obligations  in  2008  and  beyond  will  likely  increase  as  payments  due  in  2006  and 
2007 may be pushed out and new obligations are assumed.

The  enormity  of  legacy  airlines’  future  pension  funding  requirements  is  attrib-
utable to the size of the pension shortfall that has developed since 2000. As recently 
as  1999,  airline  pensions  were  overfunded  by  $700  million  based  on  Security  and 
Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  filings;  by  the  end  of  2004,  legacy  airlines  reported  a 
deficit of $21 billion (see figure 8), despite the termination of the US Airways pilots 
plan  in  2003.  Since  these  filings,  the  total  underfunding  has  declined  to  approxi-
mately $13.7 billion, due in part to the termination of the United Airline plans, and 
the remaining US Airways plans.14

The  extent  of  underfunding  varies  significantly  by  airline.  At  the  end  of  2004, 
prior to terminating its pension plans, United reported underfunding of $6.4 billion, 
which  represented  over  40  percent  of  United’s  total  operating  revenues  in  2004.  In 
contrast,  Alaska  reported  pension  underfunding  of  $303  million  at  the  end  of  2004, 
or  13.5  percent  of  its  operating  revenues.  Since  United  terminated  its  pensions, 
Delta and Northwest now appear to have the most significant pension funding defi-
cits—over  $5  billion  and  nearly  $4  billion  respectively—which  represent  about  35 
percent of 2004 operating revenues, at each airline. 

The growth of pension underfunding is attributable to 3 factors: 
• Assets losses and low interest rates. Airline pension asset values dropped nearly 
20 percent from 2001 through 2004 along with the decline in the stock market, 
while  future  obligations  have  steadily  increased  due  to  declines  in  the  interest 
rates used to calculate the liabilities of plans. 

• Management  and  labor  union  decisions.  Pension  plans  have  been  funded  far 
less  than  they  could  have  on  a  tax-deductible  basis.  PBGC  examined  101  cases 
of  airline  pension  contributions  from  1997  through  2002,  and  found  that  while 
the  maximum  deductible  contribution  was  made  in  10  cases,  no  cash  contribu-
tions were made in 49 cases where they could have contributed.15 When airlines 
did  make  tax  deductible  contributions,  it  was  often  far  less  than  the  maximum 
permitted. For example, the airlines examined could have contributed a total of 
$4.2  billion  on  a  tax-deductible  basis  in  2000  alone,  but  only  contributed  about 
$136 million despite recording profits of $4.1 billion (see figure 9).16 In addition, 
management  and  labor  have  sometimes  agreed  to  salary  and  benefit  increases 
beyond  what  could  reasonably  be  afforded.  For  example,  in  the  spring  of  2002, 
United’s  management  and  mechanics  reached  a  new  labor  agreement  that  in-
creased  the  mechanics’  pension  benefit  by  45  percent,  but  the  airline  declared 
bankruptcy the following December.

• Pension funding rules are flawed. Existing laws and regulations governing pen-
sion  funding  and  premiums  have  also  contributed  to  the  underfunding  of  de-
fined  benefit  pension  plans.  As  a  result,  financially  weak  plan  sponsors,  acting 
within  the  law,  have  not  only  been  able  to  avoid  contributions  to  their  plans, 
but  also  increase  plan  liabilities  that  are  at  least  partially  insured  by  PBGC. 
Under  current  law,  reported  measures  of  plan  funding  have  likely  overstated 
the  funding  levels  of  pension  plans,  thereby  reducing  minimum  contribution 
thresholds  for  plan  sponsors.  And  when  plan  sponsors  were  required  to  make 
additional  contributions,  they  often  substituted  ‘‘account  credits’’  for  cash  con-
tributions,  even  as  the  market  value  of  plan  assets  may  have  been  in  decline. 
Furthermore,  the  funding  rule  mechanisms  that  were  designed  to  improve  the 
condition of poorly funded plans were ineffective. 17 Other lawful plan provisions 
and  amendments,  such  as  lump  sum  distributions  and  unfunded  benefit  in-
creases  may  also  have  contributed  to  deterioration  in  the  funding  of  certain 
plans. Finally, the premium structure in PBGC’s single-employer pension insur-
ance program does not encourage better plan funding. 

The  cost  to  PBGC  and  participants  of  defined  benefit  pension  terminations  has 
grown  in  recent  years  as  the  level  of  pension  underfunding  has  deepened.  When 
Eastern  Airlines  defaulted  on  its  pension  obligations  of  nearly  $1.7  billion  in  1991, 
for  example,  claims  against  the  insurance  program  totaled  $530  million  in  under-
funded pensions and participants lost $112 million. By comparison, the US Airways 
and United pension terminations cost PBGC $9.6 billion in combined claims against 
the  insurance  program  and  reduced  participants’  benefits  by  $5.2  billion  (see  table 
2).

Note:  ‘‘Benefit  liability’’  is  the  value  of  the  benefits  promised  to  participants  and  their  beneficiaries  imme-
diately  prior  to  plan  termination.  ‘‘PBGC  liability’’  is  the  amount  that  PBGC  pays  after  statutory  guarantee 
limits  are  imposed.  ‘‘Net  claim  on  PBGC’’  is  the  difference  between  the  PBGC  liability  and  the  assets  PBGC 
obtains  from  the  plan.  ‘‘Estimated  participant  losses,’’  the  difference  between  the  Benefit  Liability  and  the 
PBGC  liability,  equals  the  value  of  the  benefits  that  plan  participants  and  their  beneficiaries  lose  when  PBGC 
takes over a plan. 

In recent pension terminations, because of statutory limits, active- and high-sala-
ried  employees  generally  lost  more  of  their  promised  benefits  compared  to  retirees 
and low-salaried employees. For example, PBGC generally does not guarantee bene-
fits above a certain amount, currently $45,614 annually per participant at age 65.18 
For participants who retire before 65, the benefits guaranteed are even less; partici-
pants that retire at age 60 are currently limited to $29,649. Commercial pilots often 
end up with substantial benefit cuts when their plans are terminated, because they 
generally have high benefit amounts, and are also required by FAA to retire at age 
60. Far fewer non-pilot retirees are affected by the maximum payout limits. For ex-
ample,  at  US  Airways  fewer  than  5  percent  of  retired  mechanics  and  attendants 
faced benefit cuts as a result of the pension termination. Tables 3 and 4 summarize 
the  expected  cuts  in  benefits  for  different  groups  of  United’s  active  and  retired  em-
ployees.

It is important to emphasize that relieving legacy airlines of their defined benefit 
funding costs will help alleviate immediate liquidity pressures, but does not fix their 
underlying  cost  structure  problems,  which  are  much  greater.  Pension  costs,  while 
substantial,  are  only  a  small  portion  of  legacy  airlines’  overall  costs.  As  noted  pre-
viously  in  figure  3,  the  cost  of  legacy  airlines’  defined  benefit  plans  accounted  for 
a  0.4  cent,  or  15  percent  difference  between  legacy  and  low-cost  airline  unit  costs. 
The  remaining  85  percent  of  the  unit  cost  differential  between  legacy  and  low-cost

carriers  is  attributable  to  factors  other  than  defined  benefits  pension  plans.  More-
over, even if legacy airlines terminated their defined benefit plans it would not fully 
eliminate  this  portion  of  the  unit  cost  differential  because,  according  to  labor  offi-
cials we interviewed, other plans would replace them. 
Concluding Observations 

While the airline industry was deregulated 27 years ago, the full effect on the air-
line  industry’s  structure  is  only  now  becoming  evident.  Dramatic  changes  in  the 
level  and  nature  of  demand  for  air  travel  combined  with  an  equally  dramatic  evo-
lution  in  how  airlines  meet  that  demand  have  forced  a  drastic  restructuring  in  the 
competitive  structure  of  the  industry.  Excess  capacity  in  the  airline  industry  since 
2000 has greatly diminished airlines’ pricing power. Profitability, therefore, depends 
on  which  airlines  can  most  effectively  compete  on  cost.  This  development  has  al-
lowed inroads for low-cost airlines and forced wrenching change upon legacy airlines 
that had long competed based on a high-cost business model. 

The  historically  high  number  of  airline  bankruptcies  and  liquidations  is  a  reflec-
tion of the industry’s inherent instability. However, this should not be confused with 
causing  the  industry’s  instability.  There  is  no  clear  evidence  that  bankruptcy  has 
contributed to the industry’s economic ills, including overcapacity and underpricing, 
and there is some evidence to the contrary. Equally telling is how few airlines that 
have  filed  for  bankruptcy  protection  are  still  doing  business.  Clearly,  bankruptcy 
has not afforded these companies a special advantage. 

Bankruptcy  has  become  a  means  by  which  some  legacy  airlines  are  seeking  to 
shed their costs and become more competitive. However, the termination of pension 
obligations by United Airlines and US Airways has had substantial and wide-spread 
effects  on  the  PBGC  and  thousands  of  airline  employees,  retirees,  and  other  bene-
ficiaries.  Liquidity  problems,  including  $10.4  billion  in  near  term  pension  contribu-
tions,  may  force  additional  legacy  airlines  to  follow  suit.  Some  airlines  are  seeking 
legislation  to  allow  more  time  to  fund  their  pensions.  If  their  plans  are  frozen  so 
that future liabilities do not continue to grow, allowing an extended payback period 
may reduce the likelihood that these airlines will file for bankruptcy and terminate 
their  pensions  in  the  coming  year.  However,  unless  these  airlines  can  reform  their 
overall cost structures and become more competitive with low-cost competition; this 
will be only a temporary reprieve. 

This concludes my statement. I would be pleased to respond to any questions that 

you or other Members of the Subcommittee may have at this time.* 
ENDNOTES 

1 While there is variation among airlines in regards to the size and financial con-
dition,  we  adhere  to  a  construct  adopted  by  industry  analysts  to  group  large  pas-
senger airlines into one of two groups—legacy and low-cost. Legacy airlines (Alaska, 
American,  Continental,  Delta,  Northwest,  United,  and  US  Airways)  predate  airline 
deregulation of 1978 and have adopted a hub-and-spoke network model that can be 
more expensive to operate than a simple point-to-point service model. Low cost air-
lines  (AirTran,  America  West,  ATA,  Frontier,  JetBlue,  Southwest,  and  Spirit)  have 
generally  entered  the  market  since  1978,  are  smaller,  and  generally  employ  a  less 
costly  point-to-point  service  model.  The  7  low-cost  airlines  have  consistently  main-
tained lower unit costs than the 7 legacy airlines. 

2 Two  other  smaller  carriers—ATA  Airlines  and  Aloha—are  also  in  bankruptcy 
protection.  Hawaiian  Airlines  just  emerged  from  bankruptcy  protection  earlier  this 
month. 

3 The  Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation’s  (PBGC)  single-employer  insurance 
program is a Federal program that insures certain benefits of the more than 34 mil-
lion worker, retiree, and separated vested participants of over 29,000 private-sector 
defined-benefit  pension  plans.  Defined-benefit  pension  plans  promise  a  benefit  that 
is  generally  based  on  an  employee’s  salary  and  years  of  service,  with  the  employer 
being  responsible  to  fund  the  benefit,  invest  and  manage  plan  assets,  and  bear  the 
investment  risk.  A  single-employer  plan  is  one  that  is  established  and  maintained 
by only one employer. It may be established unilaterally by the sponsor, or through 
a collective bargaining agreement.

studies of hub markets affected by airline bankruptcy or service withdrawals, inter-
views with industry and subject area experts, and analyses of SEC and PBGC data 
to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. 

6 Legacy  airlines’  fuel  costs  as  a  percentage  of  total  operating  costs  doubled  from 
11.5  percent  during  the  4th  quarter  of  1998  to  22.9  percent  during  the  4th  quarter 
of  2004.  Fuel  costs  for  these  airlines  were  $5  billion  higher  in  2004  than  in  2003— 
an amount roughly equal to their net operating losses. 

7 Airlines may file for two types of bankruptcy. Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code 
governs  the  liquidation  of  the  debtor’s  estate  by  appointed  trustees  of  the  court. 
Chapter  11  of  the  code  governs  business  reorganizations  and  allows,  among  other 
things,  companies  to  reject  collective  bargaining  agreements  and  renegotiate  con-
tracts and leases with creditors with the approval of the court. Companies may also 
convert  from  a  Chapter  11  reorganization  into  a  Chapter  7  liquidation  or  may  liq-
uidate within Chapter 11.

Change,  Challenge,  and  Competition,  A  Report  to  the  President  and  Congress,  Au-
gust 1993. 

9 Conversely,  consolidation  within  the  industry  may  help  remove  some  capacity. 
The  pending  merger  between  America  West  and  US  Airways  contemplates  an  air-
line  with  approximately  10  percent  less  total  capacity  than  what  the  two  carriers 
now  operate  independently.  The  U.S.  Federal  Government  will  own  a  significant 
stake  in  the  merged  company:  the  Air  Transportation  Stabilization  Board  will  own 
11.2 percent of the company, and the PBGC will own at least 5 percent.

12 These  estimates  include  only  legacy  airlines  that  continue  to  sponsor  defined 
benefit  pension  plans  and  reported  their  estimated  pension  obligations  to  PBGC. 
Pension  law  provisions  prohibit  publicly  identifying  the  airlines  that  have  reported 
this information. 

13 Pension  Funding  Equity  Act  of  2004  (Pub.  L.  108–218,  April  10,  2004).  The 
PFEA  also  changed  the  interest  rate  used  to  calculate  future  liability  from  the  30- 
year Treasury bond to a corporate bond rate, which effectively reduces future liabil-
ities. 

14 SEC data and PBGC data on the funded status of plans can differ because they 
serve  different  purposes  and  provide  different  information.  The  PBGC  report  fo-
cuses,  in  part,  on  the  funding  needs  of  each  pension  plan.  In  contrast,  corporate  fi-
nancial statements show the aggregate effect of all of a company’s pension plans on 
its  overall  financial  position  and  performance.  The  two  sources  may  also  differ  in 
the rates assumed for investment returns on pension assets and in how these rates 
are  used.  As  a  result,  the  information  available  from  the  two  sources  can  appear 
to  be  inconsistent.  PBGC  data  also  are  not  timely.  For  more  information,  see  GAO, 
Private Pensions: Publicly Available Reports Provide Useful but Limited Information 
on Plans’ Financial Condition (GAO–04–395) March 31, 2004. 

15 These 101 cases covered 18 pension plans sponsored by 5 airlines. 
16 Pension funding rules permit sponsors to choose the interest rate used to deter-
mine the maximum deductible pension contribution permitted from an interest rate 
‘‘corridor’’—a limited range of interest rates. In calculating the maximum deductible 
contribution,  a  higher  interest  rate  produces  a  lower  deductible  contribution  limit. 
The  maximum  deductible  contributions  referred  to  in  this  paragraph  and  figure  9 
are  calculated  using  the  lowest  interest  rate  permissible  from  the  interest  rate  cor-
ridor.

PENSIONS:  Recent  Experiences  of  Large  Defined  Benefit  Plans  Illustrate  Weak-
nesses in Funding Rules, GAO–05–294, (Washington, D.C.: May 31, 2005). 

18 This guarantee level applies to plans that terminate in 2005. The amount guar-
anteed  is  adjusted:  (1)  actuarially  for  the  participant’s  age  when  PBGC  first  begins 
paying  benefits  and  (2)  if  benefits  are  not  paid  as  a  single-life  annuity.  Because  of 
the  way  the  Employee  Retirement  and  Income  Security  Act  of  1974  (ERISA),  as 
amended, allocates plan assets to participants, certain participants can receive more 
than the PBGC guaranteed amount.

Senator  BURNS.  Thank  you.  Now  we  have  Mr.  Jim  May,  Presi-
dent and CEO of the Air Transport Association here. Thank you for 
coming. 

STATEMENT OF JAMES C. MAY, PRESIDENT/CEO, 
AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA, INC. 

Mr.  MAY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  thank  you,  Co–Chair-
man Inouye, for allowing us to appear today. My starting point dis-
cussed  at  length  in  our  written  comments  is  the  financial  state  of 
the  industry.  And  unquestionably,  as  we  all  have  acknowledged, 
the last few years have been our most difficult. 2001 to 2004 aggre-
gate net losses were $32.3 billion, and it has left our airlines deeply 
in  debt,  which  is  a  related  issue  that  we  need  to  be  sensitive  to. 
At  the  end  of  2004,  the  industry’s  net  was  more  than  $81  billion 
with a debt-to-capital ratio of 110 percent. 

Now, my comments will focus on why a financially stable airline 
industry is important to this country, the key factors inhibiting in-
dustry  financial  stability,  and  some  of  the  things  that  we  think 
need  to  happen  in  order  to  regain,  not  just  stability,  but  sustain-
able growth in profit. Simply put, a stable industry, including both 
the passenger and cargo airlines, is critical to a healthy and robust 
U.S.  economy.  Pulitzer  prize-winning  economist  Dan  Gergen  re-
leased his latest book last week and said as follows: ‘‘every day the 
airline industry propels the economic takeoff from our nation. It is 
the great enabler, leading together all corners of the country, facili-
tating  the  movement  of  people  and  goods  that  is  the  backbone  of 
economic  growth.  And  it  also  firmly  imbeds  us  in  that  awesome 
process of globalization that is defining the 21st Century.’’ 

Now, the alternative to this vision is a wounded industry unable 
to  provide  the  air  transport  demanded  by  the  shipping  and  trav-
eling  public  and  unable  to  provide  a  return  to  shareholders.  It  is 
not  an  acceptable  alternative.  Over  the  past  4  years,  airlines  have 
engaged  in  dramatic  efforts  to  reduce  those  costs  that  are  within 
our  control,  and  I’d  like  to  stress  that  point.  Reduce  those  costs 
that are within our control. Out of adversity, we have transformed 
ourselves in many ways, capital spending, $9.5 billion, a 62 percent 
reduction  from  year  2000  levels.  Pay  and  work  rule  changes  were 
hammered  out  to  achieve  a  20  percent  productivity  improvement. 
Operating  costs  have  been  trimmed,  even  to  the  point  of  removing 
pillows  and  pretzels,  and  operations  have  been  streamlined  to  re-
duce  fuel  burn,  and  we  have  improved  overall  system  efficiency, 
closed up, eliminated routes, and taken down frequencies. 

Now, in this difficult and painful process, as my good friend Mr. 
Roach  knows,  135,000  dedicated  men  and  women  have  lost  their 
jobs. That’s an 18 percent reduction from August of 2001. 

Unfortunately,  the  benefits  of  these  changes  that  have  been 
made  which  brought  the  cost  structures  of  the  older  network  car-
riers  much  closer  to  those  of  their  younger  low-cost  brethren,  and 
I  have  a  small  disagreement  with  the  first  witness  here  on  that 
point  because  I  think  we  have  reduced  and  narrowed  the  cost  dif-
ferences  with  the  low  prices  have  been  more  than  offset  by  costs 
the airlines can’t control; fuel, taxes, and fees. Unfunded mandates, 
in  particular  those  unfunded  mandates  caused  by  security  impera-
tives.  And  with  oil  trading  at  an  all-time  high  and  the  price  of  jet

fuel  skyrocketing,  and  my  colleague  to  my  left  will  talk  about  the 
difference  between  the  crack  spread,  which  is  the  difference  be-
tween  what  oil  is  trading,  and  what  we  are  actually  paying  for  jet 
fuel  for  airplanes.  This  industry  cannot  achieve  a  sustained  profit 
sufficient to repair the damage of the last 4 years. 

We  are  looking  at  a  rolling  12-month  forecast  for  the  price  of  oil 
to stay above $60 a barrel. Now, in short, those high fuel prices are 
overwhelming  our  ability  to  achieve  profitability.  It’s  noted  that  X 
fuel  minus  the  cost  of  the  increased  fuel,  a  number  of  our  carriers 
would  have  had  the  most  profitable  second  quarters  in  their  his-
tory, so it’s those external costs. 

We  are  delighted  at  reports  of  improved  revenues  and  system 
yields at some of the carriers, and certainly the possibility that one 
or two airlines might even report some small profits for the second 
quarter of this year, but domestic yields in particular are still weak 
and it remains to be seen if these revenue improvements will carry 
over into the fall and the winter quarters. At current oil prices, we 
predict a net industry loss for the year 2005 in excess of $5 billion. 
Now,  our  industry  recovery  is  also  inhibited  by  the  many  taxes 
and  fees  it  must  contend  with,  and  I  think  this  is  an  area  where 
the  government  and  this  Congress  could  help  more  by  doing  less. 
Airlines  will  pay  more  than  $15  billion  in  taxes  and  fees  in  2005, 
resulting  in  the  highest  tax  rate  of  any  industry,  according  to  one 
respected  Wall  Street  analyst.  Even  a  modest  reduction  of  the  tax 
burden  will  help  restore  the  industry  to  financial  health,  facilitate 
jobs  and  economic  growth  and  it’s  not  a  new  or  revolutionary  idea 
that  I’m  suggesting  to  you.  More  than  10  years  ago,  the  national 
Commission  to  ensure  a  strong,  competitive  airline  industry,  the 
so-called  Nanetta  Commission,  recommended,  ‘‘the  industry  be  re-
leased of its unfair tax burden’’. Now, that was 10 years ago. Look-
ing forward, I think there is a tremendous opportunity for positive 
action  approaches.  Together,  we  have  a  chance  to  reshape  the 
FAA’s  air  traffic  control  system  to  meet  current  and  future  needs, 
and reduce our costs in that system. Our antiquated air traffic con-
trol  system  based  on  ground-based  radars  should  be  retired  to  the 
Smithsonian,  where  it  can  be  admired  as  one  of  the  marvels  of 
1950s technology. I think we need to proceed swiftly and purposely 
with  the  creation  of  the  new  satellite  GPS-based  system,  one  that 
will  reduce  costs,  relieve  congestion,  authorize  traffic  flow,  and 
open  up  air  space  for  future  growth.  If  the  industry  is  to  achieve 
sustained profitability, it is imperative that Congress and the FAA 
do three things. 

First, establish an ATC funding mechanism that distributes costs 
equitably  among  all  system  users,  creating  a  reliable  funding 
stream that’s bonding and flexible enough to accommodate changes 
in  the  way  the  system  is  used.  We  need  to  have  the  FAA  operate 
the  ATC  more  efficiently,  including  consolidating  unnecessary  fa-
cilities,  decommissioning  obsolete  facilities  and  equipment,  and 
rationalizing the workforce. 

There  are  14,000  different  communications  entities  within  the 

FAA as part of the air traffic control system. That is unsafe. 

Finally,  the  FAA  must  develop  and  implement  procedures  and 
technologies  that  will  increase  current  system  capacity  and  effi-
ciency  as  quickly  as  possible,  and  that  will  enable  future  growth.

Mr.  Chairman,  with  the  health  of  the  airports  or  the  re-author-
ization  of  the  airports,  and  not  only  this  industry  and  this  com-
mittee,  I  think  it’s  time  for  an  exercise  in  very  difficult  choices.  If 
together  we  do  it  right,  we  are  going  to  lay  the  foundation  for  a 
bright  future  for  the  airlines  and  the  economy  that  we  enable.  We 
are  going  to  be  attacking  those  costs  that  we  can’t  attack  without 
your help, and we are going to continue to attack the costs that we 
have  some  control  over  in  our  own  systems.  Thank  you  for  the  op-
portunity to appear. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. May follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JAMES C. MAY, PRESIDENT/CEO, 

AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA, INC. 

The Air Transport Association of America, Inc. (ATA) appreciates the opportunity 
to  comment  on  the  financial  health  of  the  U.S.  airline  industry.  Unfortunately,  the 
overall  financial  picture  remains  grim  because  the  price  of  oil  continues  to  surge. 
Increasing oil and fuel prices have offset the recent modest improvement some car-
riers  have  experienced  on  the  revenue  front.  We  would  like  nothing  better  than  to 
dwell on what little good news there is, but to do so would be misleading. The truth 
is,  the  financial  health  of  the  U.S.  airline  industry  remains  poor,  and  the  industry 
still has a long way to go before it can be declared healthy again. 
The Current Industry Snapshot 

The  U.S.  airline  industry  in  2005  remains  in  critical  condition  and  is  poised  to 
add  over  $6  billion  to  the  $32.3  billion  in  losses  incurred  between  2001  and  2004. 
The  current  state  of  the  industry  is  the  result  of  factors  and  events  that  have  al-
tered  industry  fundamentals.  The  fact  that  industry  fundamentals  have  changed 
distinguishes this down-cycle from all prior cycles. 

One fundamental that has changed is that spending on air travel has dropped to 
0.7  percent  of  U.S.  GDP  from  its  historical  level  of  between  0.9  and  1.0  percent  of 
GDP. This means that on a proportional basis Americans today are spending consid-
erably less on flying than in previous years—amounting to roughly $29.5 billion an-
nually.  If  spending  had  slipped  to  just  0.8  percent  of  GDP,  the  industry’s  financial 
condition would be markedly different. 

All  airlines  have  been  affected  by  these  fundamental  changes,  and  all  airlines 
have  responded  in  kind  by  sharply  reducing  or  limiting  controllable  costs,  paring 
back  capital  spending,  revising  long-standing  collective  bargaining  agreements, 
streamlining operations, and improving productivity. While there may be pockets of 
such costs still to be addressed at some airlines, no one should forget that more than 
100,000 employees—one out of six—have lost their jobs since 9/11. There is no ques-
tion that the airline industry has drastically reduced controllable costs. 

Notwithstanding  these  Herculean  efforts,  industry  profitability  remains  elusive, 
and  the  timing  of  the  industry’s  return  to  profitability  is  unclear.  While  recently 
there have been some hoped-for signs of recovery, those signs have been inconsistent 
and  the  industry’s  financial  health  remains  dependent  on  many  factors  outside  of 
its  control:  a  strong  economy,  effective  security  worldwide,  reduced  or  stable  oil 
prices,  and  an  air  traffic  control  system  that  will  accommodate,  safely  and  effi-
ciently, the growth demanded by the American public. 

Notwithstanding  these  financial  challenges,  it  should  not  be  overlooked  that  air-
line  safety  has  remained  rock  solid.  ‘‘Safety  first’’  remains  the  core  industry  value. 
In  2004,  the  National  Transportation  Safety  Board  (NTSB)  reported  only  one  fatal 
accident  in  over  10  million  scheduled  departures.  In  the  three  years  2002–2004, 
there  were  just  three  fatal  accidents  in  31  million  scheduled  departures.  In  those 
three years, airlines providing Part 121 scheduled operations carried nearly 1.9 bil-
lion passengers. Without question, scheduled air service is incredibly safe. 

The events and factors that knocked the U.S. airline industry into a condition re-
quiring  the  equivalent  of  intensive  care  are  well  known  and  need  not  be  repeated 
here. However, there are certain factors that warrant further attention because they 
continue  to  adversely  affect  the  industry’s  financial  condition.  The  common  thread 
running  through  these  factors  is  that  they  are  beyond  the  direct  control  of  the  air-
lines. 
1. The Cost of Fuel Forecloses Financial Recovery 

The  simple  truth  is  that,  but  for  the  high  price  of  fuel,  the  U.S.  airline  industry 
today  could  earn  a  small  profit.  As  industry  fundamentals  go,  the  price  of  fuel  is

the  most  significant  force  affecting  the  industry  today.  For  the  ten  year  period 
1992–2001, the median price of crude oil was $19.90. Even in 2001 and 2002, crude 
oil  was  relatively  stable  in  the  $25–$26  range.  In  2003,  the  average  price  jumped 
to over $31 a barrel, and in 2004 the average price jumped again to more than $41 
a barrel. Today, crude is over $60 per barrel, and the 2005 price is expected to aver-
age at least $52 per barrel. In fact, the twelve month rolling forecast currently has 
crude oil at over $60 per barrel through July 2006.1 In essence, oil prices have near-
ly doubled in two years, and when compared to the 1992–2001 median average they 
have tripled. 

Jet Fuel prices have mirrored the price of crude oil, and 2005 prices are expected 
to  surpass  the  2004  record  prices.  The  true  cost  impact  on  the  airlines  of  this  un-
precedented increase is staggering and virtually defies comprehension. As the charts 
below  show,  the  industry’s  2004  jet  fuel  expense  would  have  been  $11.8  billion  at 
the  average  price  paid  during  the  1992–2001  period,  compared  to  the  actual  $21.4 
billion paid in 2004. We now expect the industry fuel bill to rise another $6.7 billion 
in  2005,  to  more  than  $28  billion,  assuming  fuel  consumption  remains  unchanged. 
At  some  airlines,  fuel  costs  now  exceed  personnel  costs  as  the  number  one  expense 
category.2

Given  the  vigorous  competitive  climate  of  the  industry,  discussed  below,  airlines 
have  not  been  able  to  include  in  ticket  prices  the  increased  cost  of  fuel.  To  cover 
the  jet  fuel  price  increases  from  2003  to  2004,  for  example,  passengers  would  have 
had  to  pay  on  average  an  additional  $21  per  ticket.  Yet  ticket  prices  during  this 
period  fell  because  of  intense  competition.  The  industry  would  be  in  a  much  dif-

ferent,  healthier  condition  had  the  airlines  been  able  to  pass  on  their  actual  fuel 
costs. 

An  operating  fundamental  of  the  industry  is  that  airplanes  run  only  on  jet  fuel. 
There  is  no  alternative.  The  related  economic  fundamental  is  that  the  dramatic 
change  in  the  price  of  fuel  now  appears  to  be  permanent.  The  days  of  $20–$35  per 
barrel oil are over. We will be fortunate if the price slips back to $40–$50 per barrel. 
Given  the  worldwide  demand  for  oil  products  and  finite  refining  capacity,  particu-
larly in the U.S., some analysts predict even higher prices. A recent Goldman Sachs 
report  suggests  prices  may  rise  as  high  as  $105  per  barrel.3 Moreover,  the  market 
is  highly  susceptible  to  any  possible  supply  disruption,  as  the  price  spike  in  antici-
pation  of  tropical  storm  Arlene  in  early  June  illustrated.4 On  June  17,  oil  surged 
to a then-all time high—exceeding $58 per barrel—over concerns about both supply 
and  refining  capacity.5 Last  week,  oil  prices  eclipsed  $60  per  barrel,  continuing  an 
apparently inexorable climb upward. 

The increase in the price of fuel has been rapid and dramatic. Because of the com-
plexity  of  market  forces  at  play  in  the  airline  industry,  this  fundamental  economic 
change  strongly  affects  the  cost  side  of  the  ledger,  increasing  the  revenues  needed 
for  profitability.  As  a  result,  complete  recovery—defined  by  a  return  to  profit-
ability—remains  foreclosed.  When  the  industry  might  achieve  profitability  remains 
uncertain. As one market analyst observed recently: 

On a non-fuel basis, operating profitability . . . is as good as it was in the late 
1990s.  While  these  facts  are  exciting  . . .,  they  may  also  be  totally  moot  if  oil 
prices  do  not  return  to  [historical  norms]  . . .  Unfortunately,  high  fuel  prices 
are consuming what would otherwise be an upcycle for the industry.6 

2. Taxes and Fees Weigh Down the Industry 

The  industry  continues  to  be  weighed  down  by  excessive  taxes  and  fees  imposed 
on  airlines  and  their  customers.  The  negative  economic  impact  of  these  taxes  and 
fees is a drag on the industry and hampers its ability to return to profitability. This 
is one area in which the government could help more by doing less. As one analyst 
has noted: 

[T]he  airline  industry  pays  the  highest  Federal  tax  rate  of  any  industry  as  it 
continues  to  lose  massive  amounts  of  money  through  user  and  security  taxes 
that amount to an estimated 10 percent of revenues . . . in reality, in a highly 
competitive,  weak  revenue  environment,  the  taxes  are  paid  for  by  the  airlines 
. . . 
Ray  Neidl,  Speech  at  the  National  Air  Service  Conference  (January  24,  2005). 
The  tax  and  fee  burden  on  airlines  operating  in,  to,  and  from  the  U.S.  exceeded 
$14 billion in FY 2004 and are expected to exceed $15 billion in 2005. This tax bur-
den  distorts  the  normal  functioning  of  market  forces  and  fundamentally  depresses 
the industry. Nonetheless, the appetite for taxing the industry remains strong. Since 
1988,  the  average  tax  on  a  $200  domestic  round-trip  ticket  has  increased  250  per-
cent,  while  average  domestic  yields  have  actually  declined  3  percent.  This  is  so  de-
spite  the  1993  recommendation,  made  by  the  National  Commission  to  Ensure  a 
Strong  Competitive  Airline  Industry,  to  relieve  the  industry  of  its  ‘‘unfair  tax  bur-
den.’’ 7

4 A June 10, 2005 report issued by the Energy Risk Management Group of Fimat, for example, 
stated:  ‘‘The  response  to  Arlene’s  approach  shows  with  brutal  clarity  how  sensitive  the  market 
is to any possible supply disruption. With the potential impact on production and transportation 
at least part of the rally was justified. . . . The storm headlines surprised and prompted waves 
of  short  covering  and  possibly  a  moderate  amount  of  fresh  speculative  buying,  as  well.’’

cial health. We believe those provisions violate reasonable principles of common sense and good 
public  policy  and  we  are  of  the  opinion  changes  must  be  made  to  relieve  the  airline  industry’s

*Analysis  considers  Federal  taxes  and  fees  only;  does  not  examine  the  broader  impact  of  State  and  local 

taxes, which can be especially high on alcohol and tobacco. 

Sources: ATA research; Internal Revenue Service; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms. 
ATA  appreciates  this  Committee’s  efforts  to  upend  the  Administration’s  proposed 
increase of the passenger security fee for FY 2006. As this Committee is well aware, 
security  fees  and  taxes  account  for  a  significant  portion  of  the  overall  tax  and  fee 
burden  on  the  industry.  In  FY  2005,  we  estimate  that  the  industry  will  provide  to 
DHS over $3.2 billion in direct fees and taxes. Add to this the foregone revenue from 
certain  federally  mandated  programs  and  the  out-of-pocket  expenses  for  other  un-
funded  mandates,  and  very  quickly  the  industry’s  annual  security  cost  burden  ex-
ceeds $4 billion. That number will only increase as more passengers fly. Yet the Ad-
ministration  and  Members  of  Congress  continue  to  discuss  and  debate  several  new 
mandates.8 The  airline  industry  cannot  be  expected  to  achieve  profitability  if  the 
government  continues  to  impose  more  and  more  taxes,  fees,  and  unfunded  man-
dates. 

Unfortunately,  the  ‘‘cash  cow’’  view  of  the  airline  industry  infects  the  rest  of  the 
world.  Several  G–8  member  states  recently  proposed  a  ‘‘solidarity  tax’’  on  airplane 
tickets as a mechanism to raise money to assist developing countries address health 
and welfare needs. In the view of these countries, because the airline industry facili-
tates  globalization,  and  because  ‘‘airline  passengers  seldom  belong  to  the  poorest 
segments  of  the  population,’’  a  tax  on  air  transportation  is  justified.  The  problem 
with  this  approach,  of  course,  is  that  it  is  basically  an  ‘‘ends  justify  the  means’’  ar-
gument and could apply to any number of issues regardless of merit. 

As  we  have  said  previously,  it  does  not  matter  whether  a  tax  or  fee  is  imposed 
on  passengers  or  airlines.  It  is  the  imposition  of  the  tax  that  is  significant,9 with 
the  result  being  that  the  more  the  government  collects  for  air  travel,  the  less  the 
airlines are able to charge. As Treasury Secretary Snow has stated, ‘‘Economics tells 
us  that  anything  you  tax,  you  get  less  of.  That’s  why  high  marginal  taxes  . . .  are 
a  bad  idea—they  kill  jobs.’’  In  our  view,  with  the  right  tax  policy,  the  government 
can foster job creation and financial stability in the industry. 

Unfortunately,  excessive  taxes  on  the  airline  industry  are  crippling  a  vital  seg-
ment  of  our  economy.  The  U.S.  airline  industry  plays  a  major  role  in  driving  the 

8 These  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  installation  and  maintenance  of  counter-manpads  de-
vices,  additional  in-line  EDS  baggage  screening  equipment,  increased  cargo  screening  on  pas-
senger and all-cargo flights, implementation of the DHS Secure Flight passenger screening pro-
gram, and promulgation of a rule requiring airlines to transmit passenger manifest and related 
passport data one hour before departure of in-bound international flights. 

9 ‘‘The  statutory  incidence  of  a  tax  indicates  who  is  legally  responsible  for  the  tax.  . . .  Be-
cause prices may change in response to the tax, knowledge of statutory incidence tells us essen-
tially  nothing  about  who  is  really  paying  the  tax. . .  The  [economic]  incidence  of  a  unit  tax  is 
independent  of  whether  it  is  levied  on  consumers  or  producers. . .  In  general,  the  more  elastic 
the  demand  curve,  the  less  the  tax  borne  by  consumers. . .  The  key  point  to  remember  is  that 
nothing about the incidence of a tax can be know without information on the relevant behavioral 
elasticities.’’ Public Finance (4th Ed.), Harvey S. Rosen (Princeton University Department of Ec-
onomics).

commerce  of  the  United  States  and  the  growth  of  our  national  economy.  An  eco-
nomically crippled airline industry is a drag on the national economy and ultimately 
will  prevent  it  from  realizing  its  full  potential.  Robust  air  transportation  is  critical 
to sustaining our recovery and catalyzing the next round of growth essential to our 
nation’s economic competitiveness. As airline job losses continue to mount, and serv-
ice to small- and mid-size communities is cut, it is not simply the airlines and their 
employees  who  are  suffering;  it  is  the  broader  economy  that  feels  the  results.  Air 
transportation  grows  both  the  national  and  local  economies—its  absence  reverses 
that effect. 

3. Pricing Power Remains Inadequate for Airlines To Recover Costs 

Throughout  2004,  and  well  into  2005,  U.S.  airlines  were  unable  to  raise  prices. 
Numerous  efforts  failed  because  of  the  intense  competitive  nature  of  the  industry 
and  the  fundamentals  of  supply  and  demand.  Market  analysts  uniformly  observed 
that all airlines lacked pricing power to pass through increased costs. For example: 
[L]egacy carriers and LCCs continue to fight strenuously for market share with 
a  complete  lack  of  pricing  power  creating  an  anemic  revenue  environment  . . . 
Fuel  . . .  remains  a  major  factor  in  the  industry’s  inability  to  make  a  profit, 
and  we  remind  investors  that  this  is  not  the  first  time  the  airlines  have  been 
faced with tough year over year comps. However, this is the first time that car-
riers  have  not  been  able  to  pass  these  costs  on  to  the  consumer  as  evident  by 
several failed fare increases and the declining yields.

line Industry Research Report, December 21, 2004.

Recently, airlines have been able to maintain some price increases, and this mod-
est  success  offers  a  glimmer  of  hope  for  the  future.  At  this  point,  however,  it  re-
mains  only  a  glimmer.  During  the  second  week  of  June,  for  example,  multiple  at-
tempts at fare increases failed under competitive pressures.10 Passengers remain ex-
tremely  price  sensitive,  and  price  competition  among  all  airlines  is  robust.11 Con-
sequently, even low-cost airlines are not sanguine about increasing revenue through 
fare  hikes,  as  confirmed  by  Independence  Air’s  Eric  Nordling:  ‘‘The  flying  public  is 
highly elastic; it is very sensitive to price.’’ 12 

The  simple  truth  is  that  if  the  airlines  could  raise  their  prices  to  cover  fuel  costs 
and  the  many  taxes  and  fees  they  pay,  they  would  have  done  so  by  now.  They 
haven’t,  and  basic  marketplace  principles—competition  and  elasticity—are  con-
tinuing  to  prevent  them  from  doing  so.  It  remains  to  be  seen  when,  if  ever,  pricing 
power  returns  to  the  point  where  profitability  can  be  restored  notwithstanding  in-
creasing fuel prices. 
4. Expanding the Air Traffic Control System’s Capacity and Enhancing ATC 

Productivity Is Critical to the Financial Health of the Industry 

The  American  people  want  convenience  and  value  for  their  money.  That  is  why 
they  are  flying  in  record  numbers  this  summer.  U.S.  airlines  provide  safe,  conven-
ient,  and  reliable  service  at  a  fair  price.13 Maintaining  system  reliability,  however, 
is becoming increasingly difficult as airlines, responding to marketplace demands for 
service, add flights. The financial health of the industry—today and in the future— 
depends in part on the ability of the FAA’s Air Traffic Control (ATC) system to pro-
vide the capacity needed to meet not only the demand for scheduled passenger and 
cargo  operations,  but  also  the  growing  appetite  of  the  non-scheduled  sector,  includ-
ing air taxis, business jet operations and, in the near future, Very Light Jets.14

Inadequate ATC system capacity will stymie airline growth and the ability of the 
industry  to  achieve  and  maintain  financial  health.  That,  in  turn,  will  adversely  af-
fect  the  commerce  of  the  United  States  and  the  American  public.  Without  a  dra-
matic change in the way our nation’s airspace is managed, congestion and resulting 
delays  will  be  overwhelming  for  consumers  and  businesses  alike.  As  it  is,  86.5  mil-
lion ATC delay minutes were responsible for adding an estimated $6.2 billion to di-
rect operating costs for U.S. airlines in 2004. The FAA is predicting that by the end 
of 2005 commercial aviation flights will have regained the peak levels of 2000.15 Op-
erations at en route centers actually have surpassed the number handled in 2000.16 
Just maintaining the safety and efficiency of our air traffic system at the current 
level  of  operations  is  not  an  option.  The  FAA  will  have  to  increase  system  capacity 
and  productivity  to  accommodate  an  estimated  25  percent  increase  in  the  volume 
of  air  traffic  in  the  next  decade.17 In  fact,  the  Joint  Planning  and  Development  Of-
fice  is  seeking  to  expand  capacity  by  as  much  as  300  percent  by  2015  to  accommo-
date  changes  in  aircraft  size  as  well  as  the  projected  growth  in  demand.18 ATA 
members support these efforts. 

The  alternative,  measures  that  restrict  operations  such  as  those  imposed  at  Chi-
cago’s  O’Hare  International  Airport,  are  unacceptable.  Arbitrary  restrictions  on  op-
erations will undermine the public benefits Congress envisioned when it deregulated 
the industry. Ultimately, such restrictions will add new operating costs as access to 
the  system  is  rationed.  Indeed,  within  the  Administration,  the  notion  of  ‘‘market- 
based’’ solutions to allocate landing and take-off rights at certain airports is gaining 
currency already. These solutions could result in new fees and charges that airlines 
would have to pay. Realistically, given the fierce price competition within the indus-
try, it is unlikely these new charges could be passed on to customers. 

The  solution  lies  in  a  modernized  ATC  system  that  uses  technology  and  oper-
ational measures to increase capacity and enable growth. In the near term, consoli-
dating  facilities  and  decommissioning  outdated  equipment  and  procedures  should 
provide  help  at  the  margins.  Capacity  of  the  current  system  can  be  increased  by 
leveraging  existing  on-board  technologies  and  creating  new  satellite-based  routes 
that  are  more  flexible  than  existing  routes;  gains  can  also  be  achieved  by  doing  a 
better  job  keeping  slower  airplanes  separated  from  faster  moving  airplanes.  A  key 
measure  is  to  manage  the  ATC  system  from  a  national  perspective  instead  of  the 
current patchwork of airspace components, each managed individually. This locally- 
driven  system  creates  too  many  opportunities  for  bottlenecks  and  inefficient  use  of 
the airspace from a total system perspective. Looking forward, any new system must 
be built on a scalable architecture that maximizes flexibility and ease of growth. 
Conclusion 

The U.S. airline industry remains in dire financial condition, with several airlines 
in  Chapter  11  and  other  airlines  facing  that  possibility  as  oil  prices  continue  to 
climb.  The  prospects  for  a  return  to  stability  and  profitability  remain  uncertain  in 
light of factors largely out of the control of the airlines. Nevertheless, it can be said 
that a glimmer of hope is on the horizon. People are flying again in record numbers, 
and airline cost-cutting measures are having a positive impact. 

Looking  forward,  Congress  and  the  Administration  will  play  a  significant  role  in 
the  financial  health  of  the  industry.  The  tax  and  fee  burden  remains  excessive  and 
should  be  reduced.  By  no  means  should  new  taxes  and  fees  be  added,  no  matter 
what the purpose. Further, when the Aviation Trust Fund comes up for reauthoriza-
tion in 2007, it will be imperative that Congress support the FAA’s efforts to expand 
ATC  system  capacity  to  permit  expected  industry  growth.  At  that  time,  Congress 
should  adopt  a  new  funding  formula  that  fairly  apportions  trust  fund  contributions 
among system users according to their use of the ATC system.

STATEMENT OF JAMIE N. BAKER, VICE PRESIDENT, 
U.S. EQUITY RESEARCH, JPMORGAN SECURITIES, INC. 

Mr.  BAKER.  Thank  you.  Chairman  Burns,  members  of  the  Com-
mittee, I do want to thank you for the opportunity to in fact speak 
here  this  morning.  Again,  my  name  is  Jamie  Baker.  I’m  the  U.S. 
airline  equity  analyst  at  JPMorgan.  Please  do  take  note  that  the 
statements that I make here today don’t reflect the official position 
of JPMorgan on these issues. 

Let  me  start  out  by  emphasizing  that,  and  echoing  some  of  the 
recent  testimony  that  it  is  in  fact  fuel  prices,  not  industry  mis-
management,  that  can  primarily  explain  why  we  have  convened 
here  today.  Fuel  prices  are  continuing  to  mask  an  underlying  re-
covery  in  the  airline  industry,  of  which  many  are  not  aware,  and 
I  would  suggest  that  with  the  exception  of  fuel,  all  of  the  relevant 
industry  cockpit  gauges,  if  you  will,  are  in  the  green  for  the  first 
time since September 11. 

Ex-fuel costs for the legacy carriers have not been this low since 
1997,  and  they  are,  in  fact,  headed  lower.  If  you  exclude  one-time 
non-cash  and  focus  on  core  costs,  those  that  suggest  future  per-
formance, then legacy carriers have in fact decreased their cost dis-
advantage  to  the  low-cost  carriers  by  nearly  50  percent.  Air  fares 
and revenues both continue to rise with no apparent negative offset 
on  demand.  U.S.  capacity,  while  still  growing  is  in  fact  growing  at 
a slower rate than many of us feared at the beginning of this year. 
If in fact fuel casts were hypothetically not an issue, both American 
and Continental Airlines would have just enjoyed their most profit-
able  second  quarters  in  their  corporate  histories.  While  we  are  not 
suggesting legacy carriers can fully match the efficiency of some of 
the smaller, low-cost competitors, the gap between the two is clear-
ly diminishing. But unfortunately, these carriers that I’m employed 
to follow, they don’t fly gliders, and therefore stripping out fuel ex-
penses  is  merely  an  analytical  exercise.  Despite  nearly  a  dozen 
mostly successful efforts at raising air fares this year, we estimated 
only  $7  per  barrel  of  crude  has  managed  to  be  offset  leaving  the 
effective  price  of  that  still  above  historic  norms.  As  such,  liquidity 
is expected to decline significantly. 

Delta  and  Northwest  will  burn  through  more  than  $1  billion  in 
cash this year inclusive of the capital they have raised here today, 
and furthermore, the industry’s ability to go deeper into debt, while 
seemingly never exhausted, is rapidly diminishing. Since 2000, air-
lines  have  borrowed  more  than  $27  billion.  They  have  seen  their 
credit  ratings  fall  substantially,  and  while  legacy  airlines  have 
begun  turning  to  nontraditional  sources  of  capital  such  as  the 
hedge  fund  community  and  the  manufacturers,  I  think  the  ability 
to  further  tap  these  resources  are  unlikely  unless  pension  reform 
can positively impact their credit ratings. 

Delta  has  disclosed  that  its  projected  minimum  pension  funding 
requirements  under  current  rules  will  increase  to  $600  million  in 
2006,  and  to  more  than  $1.5  billion  by  2008.  Similarly,  at  North-
west,  they  are  estimating  $800  million  for  requirements  for  2006 
and  $1.7  billion  for  2007.  For  this  obvious  reason,  both  Delta  and 
Northwest  are  likely  to  seek  bankruptcy  protection  and  follow  the 
damaging  precedent  set  by  United  Airlines  in  terminating  its  de-
fined benefit program. That is unless we are allowing for long-term

amortization period of deficits for sponsors agreeing to freeze their 
DB plans comes into law, and I would suggest sometime within the 
next 6 months or so. 

These are not my analytical opinion. The broader market implies 
between  a  55  and  59  percent  one-year  bankruptcy  probability  for 
Northwest and Delta. For American and Continental, arguably two 
better  positioned  carriers,  the  implied  bankruptcy  probability  over 
the next 4 years is roughly the same. I point out that these figures 
have actually worsened since my colleague, Mark Streeter, testified 
before the House 3 weeks ago. 

But  legacy  Chapter  11  filings,  and  the  accompanying  toll  on 
workers,  and  likely  service  decline  to  smaller  communities,  these 
are  not  necessarily  inevitable  occurrences.  Legacy  airline  manage-
ment  would  much  prefer  to  avoid  the  Chapter  11  process  and  in-
stead  be  left  alone  to  do  what  they  currently  are,  further  reducing 
their  competitive  disadvantage  to  the  more  youthful  and  fit,  those 
carriers that have sprung up since deregulation. 

Now,  if  the  government  sponsors  the  flexibility  to  stretch  pay-
ments  over  a  period  of  several  years,  the  sponsors,  they  must  be 
forced to maintain fiscal discipline in my opinion. The price to leg-
acy  carriers  of  potential  pension  reform  should  include  at  a  min-
imum  restrictions  on  their  ability  to  repurchase  stock,  pay  divi-
dends, or offer increased defined benefits, even if funded with cash. 
Members  of  the  Committee,  if  the  proposed  pension  legislation 
not supported by the legacy airlines does become law, I agree with 
the  broader  market  that  both  Delta  and  Northwest  will  be  forced 
to  file  bankruptcy  within  the  next  year  or  so.  The  ability  of  these 
carriers to complete their ongoing restructuring outside of the court 
process  is  almost  directly  tied  to  pension  reform  that  does  not  re-
sult  in  onerous  near-term  deficit  reduction  contributions.  With 
United  having  already  sought  its  subsidy  and  therefore  having  set 
a damaging precedent, the government instead has an opportunity 
to  allow  other  carriers  the  opportunity  to  make  good  on  promises 
that they have already made to their employees, while further pro-
tecting  taxpayers  in  the  process.  Thank  you  again  for  the  oppor-
tunity to speak here this morning. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Baker follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JAMIE N. BAKER, VICE PRESIDENT, 

U.S. EQUITY RESEARCH, JPMORGAN SECURITIES INC. 

Chairman  Burns  and  members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  inviting  me  to 
speak this morning. My name is Jamie Baker, I am the U.S. Airline equity analyst 
at  JPMorgan.  I  would  like  to  provide  the  Committee  with  an  overview  on  the  U.S. 
airline industry, its ongoing efforts at recovery, and how the pension issue and other 
factors  will  continue  to  impact  this  recovery.  I  will  also  focus  certain  comments  on 
the  remaining  legacy  airline  defined  benefit  plan  sponsors,  AMR  Corp,  Continental 
Airlines,  Delta  Air  Lines,  and  Northwest  Airlines.  Please  note  that  my  testimony 
and  statements  are  my  personal  views  and  do  not  represent  the  official  position  of 
JPMorgan. 
Fuel Is Masking Fundamental Recovery 

Unfortunately for the airlines, fuel costs are masking a fundamental recovery that 
is  well  underway.  Were  an  industry  cockpit  to  exist,  we  would  suggest  all  non-fuel 
gauges would be reading into the green, the first such instance since September 11, 
2001. For example, ex-fuel unit costs haven’t been this low since 1997, and they are 
expected  to  head  lower  still.  Airfares  and  revenue  are  both  continuing  to  rise,  with 
no apparent offset on demand. Capacity, while still increasing domestically, is rising 
at  a  slower  growth  rate  than  feared,  with  the  majority  of  that  growth  coming  from

low-cost  carriers.  In  fact,  if  fuel  were  not  an  issue,  both  American  and  Continental 
would  have  just  concluded  their  most  profitable  second  quarters  in  their  history. 
While  it  is  not  our  intent  to  suggest  that  legacy  carriers  can  fully-match  the  effi-
ciency  and  cost  competitiveness  of  their  smaller,  low-cost  carrier  competitors,  the 
chasm between the two sub-sectors is continuing to diminish. 

But Fuel Is a Reality, and Legacy Airlines Don’t Fly Gliders 

Regrettably, stripping out fuel expense is but a mere analytical exercise. Jet ker-
osene  prices  have  actually  risen  by  a  greater  degree  than  raw  crude,  in  part  given 
the shortage of refinery capacity. Year-to-date, jet kerosene has risen 44 percent vs. 
a 39 percent increase in the price of crude. 

Despite nearly a dozen, mostly successful efforts at raising fares in 2005, we esti-
mate  that  merely  $7  per  barrel  of  crude  agony  has  managed  to  be  offset,  leaving 
the  effective  price  of  that  commodity  still  well  above  historic  norms.  While  carriers 
will likely continue pressing fares higher this year and beyond, each successive fare 
increase  is  expected  to  generate  a  diminishing  return,  given  the  price-sensitivity  of 
demand.

Liquidity Is Under Pressure 

Legacy  airline  liquidity  is  expected  to  decline  significantly  in  2005.  We  estimate 
that  Delta  and  Northwest  will  each  burn  through  more  than  $1  billion  this  year, 
inclusive of the capital raised year-to-date, unless assuming cash reserves can some-
how be replenished. 

The  industry’s  ability  to  go  deeper  into  debt,  while  seemingly  inexhaustible,  does 
appear  to  be  rapidly  diminishing.  Since  2000,  U.S.  Airlines  have  borrowed  more 
than  $27  billion,  and  have  witnessed  substantial  declines  in  their  credit  ratings. 
And  while  legacy  airlines  have  been  turning  to  non-traditional  lenders,  such  as 
hedge funds and the manufacturers, the ability to further tap these resources is un-
likely, unless pension reform can positively impact their credit standings.

Our Bankruptcy Probabilities Are Largely Shared By the Market 

By looking at credit market implied cumulative default probabilities (a more accu-
rate analysis, in our opinion, than relying on equity values), the market ascribes be-
tween  a  55  percent  and  59  percent  probability  that  Northwest  and  Delta  will  file 
bankruptcy within the next 12 months. Implied one-year risk for American and Con-
tinental, arguably two better-positioned carriers, is significantly lower, though their 
implied bankruptcy probability over the next four years remains in the mid-to-high 
50 percent range.

ruptcy. 
Can the Airlines Raise Additional Capital? 

As of late, legacy airlines have been turning to non-traditional lenders. Delta has 
pre-sold frequent flier miles forward to American Express and tapped General Elec-
tric  for  a  securitized  loan.  Continental  recently  sold  miles  forward  as  well  and  bor-
rowed  against  its  last  major  unencumbered  assets  (Air  Micronesia,  its  Guam-based 
operation). 

It remains to be seen whether or not other vendors and manufacturers are willing 
to invest further in their airline partners. Nevertheless, the proposed America West 
/US  Airways  capitalization  includes  proceeds  from  Airbus,  hedge  funds,  traditional 
money  managers,  and  an  airline  maintenance  provider  (Air  Canada).  Therefore,  we 
can conclude that the legacy airlines could perhaps tap some of these same sources 
for  additional  liquidity,  especially  if  pension  reform  positively  impacts  the  credit 
standing of the legacy airlines. 

Will  Pension  Reform  Force  Additional  Legacy  Airline  Chapter  11  Filings? 
Under  some  pension  reform  proposals,  the  airlines  that  sponsor  defined  benefit 
plans will face incredibly onerous payments. Relative to the 2005 required minimum 
contribution of $450 million, Delta has disclosed that its projected minimum funding 
under the current rules will increase by 33 percent in 2006 to $600 million, by 111

percent  in  2007  to  $950  million,  and  by  255  percent  in  2008  to  $1.7  billion.  For 
Northwest, they are estimating $800 million in 2006, and $1.7 billion in 2007. 

For this reason, both Delta and Northwest are likely to seek Chapter 11, and fol-
low the damaging precedent set by United Airlines in terminating its defined benefit 
plans. This, unless a rapid decline in fuel costs or reform allowing for a longer-term 
amortization  of  deficits  for  sponsors  agreeing  to  freeze  DB  plans  comes  into  law, 
sometime within the next six months or so. 

Continental is not as exposed to rising payments given the nature of the airline’s 
defined benefit plan relative to Northwest and Delta. Nevertheless, the combination 
of the current oil price environment, current industry revenue, and higher required 
pension  payments  could  force  Continental  to  consider  Chapter  11  as  well  in  2006. 
AMR has enough liquidity-raising options and current liquidity to perhaps bridge 
the  gap  between  today’s  environment  and  one  where  industry  revenue  and  stock 
market improvement make required pension payments more manageable. 

The  issues  surrounding  credit  balances  and  annual  premiums,  while  important, 
are  secondary  to  both  the  length  of  the  amortization  period  and  the  interest  rate 
to value liabilities in the cases of Delta and Northwest. 

For  AMR,  the  interest  rate  assumption  and  premium  payments  are  most  critical 
given the company’s and its workers’ desire to maintain defined benefit plans rather 
than the freezing approach embraced by Delta and Northwest management. 

UAL  is  AMR’s  largest  competitor.  Although  UAL’s  replacement  defined  contribu-
tion plan costs are significant, I nonetheless am concerned that AMR (and other leg-
acy  majors)  will  be  at  a  strategic  disadvantage  to  UAL  going  forward  because  of 
UAL’s successful elimination of its defined benefit plans. 
Multiple Bankruptcies Are By No Means Inevitable 

Legacy  Chapter  11  filings,  with  their  accompanying  toll  on  workers  and  expected 
service  declines  to  smaller  communities,  are  not  inevitable,  in  our  opinion.  Legacy 
airline  managements  would  much  prefer  to  avoid  the  process,  and  instead  remain 
concentrated  on  the  task  at  hand—further  reducing  their  competitive  disadvantage 
versus  the  more  youthful  and  fit,  those  airlines  that  have  sprung  up  since  airline 
deregulation.  Their  ability  to  succeed,  however,  is  largely  predicated  on  favourable 
airline-specific pension reform and/or sharply lower energy prices. 

Should  the  government  afford  defined  benefit  sponsors  the  flexibility  to  stretch 
payments  out  over  a  period  of  several  years,  the  sponsors  must  be  forced  to  main-
tain  fiscal  discipline.  Such  discipline  should  include,  though  not  be  limited  to,  re-
strictions  on  the  ability  to  repurchase  stock,  pay  dividends,  or  offer  increased  de-
fined benefits even if funded with cash. 

Conclusion 

If  the  proposed  pension  legislation  not  supported  by  the  legacy  airlines  is  passed 
into  law,  we  agree  with  the  market  that  near-term  Chapter  11  filings  become  sig-
nificantly more likely. Put differently, certain airlines are likely to pursue a United- 
type  strategy,  whereby  the  PBGC  shortfall  will  increase  and  taxpayers  and  plan

participants  will  suffer  as  a  result.  Alternatively,  pension  reform  that  does  not  re-
sult in onerous near-term deficit reduction contributions would likely materially di-
minish  bankruptcy  risk  from  non-fuel  related  issues,  and  otherwise  allow  carriers 
the chance to make good on promises already made to employees, while further pro-
tecting taxpayers and stakeholders in the process.

TRANSPORTATION, 

STATEMENT  OF  ROBERT  ROACH,  JR.,  GENERAL  VICE 
PRESIDENT 
INTERNATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION  OF  MACHINISTS  AND  AEROSPACE  WORKERS 
(IAM) 
Mr.  ROACH.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to 
speak  today.  My  name  is  Robert  Roach,  Jr.  I’m  the  Vice  President 
of  the  Machinists  Union.  I’m  appearing  at  the  request  of  Inter-
national President, R. Thomas Buffenberger. The Machinists Union 
represents more than 100,000 U.S. airline workers in almost every 
classification  including  ramp  service  workers,  mechanics,  public 
contact employees, and flight attendants. 

Mr.  Chairman,  the  financial  condition  of  the  airline  industry  to 
date  is  clearly  miserable,  and  without  drastic  and  immediate 
change, the future continues to be bleak. 

September 11 was the start of the current crisis for airlines how-
ever  the  seeds  for  this  calamity—excuse  me,  were  planted  many 
years  earlier  by  the  airlines  themselves.  When  airlines  were 
healthy,  legacy  airlines  spent  surplus  cash  by  purchasing  aircraft, 
foolish mega-mergers. 

One  noted  exception  is  Southwest  Airlines,  which  prudently  ex-
panded  their  profitable  margins  while  increasing  cash  reserves  for 
the  inevitable.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  Southwest  Air-
lines,  which  is  95  percent  unionized,  pays  the  employees  the  high-
est  wages  and  benefits  in  the  industry.  I  want  to  reiterate  that. 
Southwest  Airlines  pays  the  highest  wages  and  benefits  in  the  in-
dustry, while still maintaining profitability. 

At the same time, the airlines refuse to properly fund their pen-
sion plans and more than 100,000 participants at US Airways have 
lost  money.  To  ask  employees  to  further  bail  out  corporations  is 
disgraceful  and  to  force  retirees  to  subsidize  corporate  incom-
petence  is  unforgivable.  The  Machinists  Union  has  met  with  ATA 
and  airline  CEOs  on  how  to  correct  industry  problems.  I  believe 
such partnerships should be continued and expanded. Norman Mi-
neta convened an airline summit with government officials to joint-
ly develop solutions to the problems. The IAM is proactive, but we 
cannot do it alone. 

In  the  airline  industry  we  have  suffered  more  than  six  Chapter 
11  bankruptcies.  Hawaiian  and  Aloha  being  two  of  them,  and 
United  Airlines.  My  colleagues  have  said  on  this  panel  we  believe 
Northwest and Delta are fastly approaching that line. We have re-

duced  costs.  We  have  lost  pension  money,  and  our  health  benefits 
have been reduced. 

I believe what you’re going to hear today is differences of opinion 
on how to fix the problem, and that you will hear we have the low- 
cost carrier, but the low-cost carrier advantage is because they are 
new  and  because  they  don’t  have  the  certain  wages  and  benefits 
that they have today, but as time goes on they will catch up, that’s 
why  if  you  want  to  look  at  a  low-cost  carrier,  look  at  Southwest 
Airlines as a model, that they are properly managed, and that they 
have been around 27 years and at the same time maintaining prof-
itability. 

We  cannot  sit  here  today  and  unlike  my  colleagues,  if  oil  prices 
are what they are, then we must do something, and we believe that 
that  effort  is  a  coordinated  effort.  We  don’t  think,  as  I  said  before 
this  same  committee  on  September  20,  2001,  that  you  can  just 
throw  money  at  the  problem.  That  happened  in  2001  and  we  are 
in  worse  condition  today  than  we  were  then.  I  think  we  need  co-
ordinated effort. I think with government, Department of Transpor-
tation  or  some  Senate  committee,  Presidential  commission,  along 
with  management  and  labor  need  to  sit  in  a  room  with  a  commis-
sion and try to find coordinated solutions to the problems that will 
confront  us  in  the  future,  and  to  do  otherwise  would  be  putting  a 
band-aid on a bleeding artery. 

I thank this committee for the opportunity to speak to them and 
present  our  point  of  view,  and  we  are  prepared  to  work  with  this 
committee  and  management  to  develop  solutions  to  the  problems. 
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Roach follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT ROACH,  JR.,  GENERAL VICE PRESIDENT OF 
TRANSPORTATION,  INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS AND AEROSPACE 
WORKERS (IAM) 
Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  members  of  this  Committee  for  the  opportunity 
to  speak  to  you  today.  My  name  is  Robert  Roach,  Jr.,  General  Vice  President  of 
Transportation for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Work-
ers  (IAM).  I  am  appearing  at  the  request  of  International  President  R.  Thomas 
Buffenbarger.  The  Machinists  Union  represents  more  than  100,000  U.S.  airline 
workers  in  almost  every  classification,  including  ramp  service  workers,  mechanics, 
public contact employees and flight attendants. 

Mr. Chairman, the financial condition of the airline industry is clearly miserable, 
and  without  dramatic  changes,  the  future  continues  to  look  bleak.  From  2001  to 
2004, legacy carriers have lost more than $28 billion, and they are expected to lose 
an additional $5 billion in 2005. 

Of the 146 airline Chapter 11 filings since 1979, in only 16 cases are the airlines 

still in business. 

September  11,  2001,  is  often  cited  as  the  start  of  the  current  crisis  for  airlines. 
However,  the  seeds  for  this  calamity  were  planted  years  earlier  by  the  airlines 
themselves. 

When airlines were healthy, legacy carriers spent surplus cash by purchasing un-
necessary  aircraft,  irresponsibly  expanding  operations,  and  pursuing  foolish  mega- 
mergers. One noted exception is Southwest Airlines, which expanded prudently into 
profitable markets while increasing its cash reserves for the inevitable, recurring in-
dustry slump. 

At  the  same  time,  these  airlines  refused  to  properly  fund  their  employee  pension 
plans, and now more than a hundred thousand participants and beneficiaries at US 
Airways  and  United  Airlines  have  lost  more  than  $5  billion  of  their  promised  pen-
sion benefits. 

To  ask  employees  to  bail  out  failed  corporations  is  disgraceful.  To  force  retirees 

to subsidize corporate incompetence is unforgivable.

The Machinists Union has met with the ATA and individual airline CEO’s to dis-
cuss  how  to  correct  the  industry’s  problems.  I  believe  such  partnerships  should  be 
continued and expanded. 

Earlier this year, I asked Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta to convene an 
airline  summit  so  airline  executives,  labor  leaders,  and  government  officials  could 
jointly develop solutions to the industry’s problems. 

The IAM has been proactive in our efforts to transform the industry, but we can-

not do it alone. 

For  a  snapshot  of  the  financial  condition  of  the  airline  industry,  one  only  has  to 
look  at  the  unprecedented  sacrifices  employees  have  been  forced  to  make  just  to 
keep this industry alive. 
United Airlines 

Almost immediately after signing contracts with the IAM in 2002, United Airlines 
came  to  its  unions  seeking  concessions.  The  IAM  engaged  in  these  discussions  over 
a period of several months in an effort to keep the company out of bankruptcy. 

In  support  of  the  company’s  attempt  to  obtain  a  loan  guarantee  from  the  Air 
Transportation  Stabilization  Board  (ATSB)  in  November  2002,  ramp  service  and 
public  contact  employees  agreed  to  cuts  that  would  save  the  company  $160  million 
a year. 

This  was  happening  as  employees  saw  the  value  of  the  company  stock  held  in 
their ESOP and employees’ 401(k) accounts dwindling. Many employees lost tens of 
thousands in retirement savings as a result. 

United failed in its attempts to reorganize outside of bankruptcy, and immediately 
after  its  Chapter  11  filing  the  company  asked  the  bankruptcy  judge  to  impose 
‘‘emergency’’ pay cuts of 14 percent on IAM members. The judge authorized this re-
quest. 

Laboring  under  these  court-imposed  pay  cuts,  IAM  members  went  to  the  bar-
gaining table and in the spring of 2003 agreed to permanent cuts in pay and bene-
fits  that  would  save  United  $460  million  a  year  ($2.644  billion  from  2003  to  2009). 
These  concessions  also  included  drastic  reductions  in  retiree  healthcare  benefits  for 
anyone  retiring  after  July  1,  2003.  As  a  result,  many  employees  retired  from  the 
company in an effort to preserve these benefits. 

United then took steps to cut retiree benefits for existing retirees and filed a mo-
tion in court to ask a judge to impose cuts if agreements could not be reached with 
the  retirees’  representatives.  This  heartless  move  saved  United  $50  million  a  year. 
In the Spring of 2004, the ATSB denied United’s bid for a loan guarantee a second 
time  and,  once  again,  United  turned  to  its  employees  for  more  cuts.  United  also 
ceased  funding  its  pension  plans,  the  first  in  a  series  of  steps  which  ultimately  led 
to their termination by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. 

In January 2005, United once again sought ‘‘emergency’’ pay cuts from the bank-
ruptcy  court—this  time  it  was  11  percent.  The  IAM  and  UAL  reached  a  tentative 
agreement  on  June  17,  2005,  that,  if  ratified  by  the  membership,  will  provide 
United  with  an  additional  $176  million  a  year  from  2003  to  2009.  Savings  attrib-
utable to the termination of IAM member’s pensions will save United another $217 
million a year. 

Successive  rounds  of  cuts  have  delivered  United  annual  savings  of  more  than 
$853  million  a  year  off  the  backs  of  IAM  members.  By  the  end  of  this  bankruptcy 
case,  IAM  members  will  have  sacrificed  more  than  $4.6  billion  for  United  Airlines, 
which  is  about  three  times  more  than  the  value  of  all  loan  guarantees  given  out 
by the ATSB. 
US Airways 

In  US  Airways’  first  bankruptcy  in  2002,  IAM  members  agreed  to  two  rounds  of 
contract  concessions  totaling  $276  million  per  year,  or  $1.8  billion  over  61⁄2 years. 
Pay was cut by an average of 7.5 percent. Employees also experienced drastic in-
creases in their contributions for healthcare coverage, which had the effect of reduc-
ing  take-home  pay  even  further.  Employees’  share  of  healthcare  premiums  roughly 
doubled for single coverage, and almost tripled for family coverage, translating into 
an  additional  reduction  in  take  home  pay  of  1  percent  to  3  percent,  depending  on 
the employee’s classification. 

Immediately after filing for bankruptcy for the second time in as many years, US 
Airways management petitioned the court to impose ‘‘emergency’’ pay cuts of 23 per-
cent  for  all  union-represented  employees,  as  well  as  reduced  contributions  to  pen-
sion plans. Management and salaried employees’ pay was reduced by only 5 percent 
to 10 percent. 

On  October  15,  2004,  the  bankruptcy  court  allowed  an  emergency  21  percent  cut 

in pay.

39 

US  Airways  then  approached  the  IAM  to  negotiate  permanent  reductions  to  pay 
and benefits, and filed a petition with the bankruptcy court to reject the IAM’s col-
lective bargaining agreements. Ultimately, the parties were not able to reach agree-
ment  and  the  court  granted  the  company’s  request  to  abrogate  the  IAM’s  collective 
bargaining agreements on January 10, 2005. IAM members then voted to accept the 
company’s ‘‘last and final offer’’ that involved pay and benefits reductions even more 
drastic than what were ratified in the first bankruptcy. 

Under  these  latest  terms,  IAM  members  will  give  up  $346  million  a  year  in  pay, 
benefits, and work rules. Mechanic and related employees will see their pay reduced 
by  an  average  of  15  percent.  Almost  all  Utility  jobs  are  able  to  be  outsourced,  and 
roughly a third of mechanic and stock clerk jobs can be farmed out. 

In  addition,  the  defined  benefit  pension  plans  were  terminated,  with  the  sole  ex-
ception  being  the  IAM’s  multi-employer  defined  benefit  National  Pension  Plan  for 
our Fleet Service members, who experienced pay cuts of 12.8 percent to 20 percent. 
In addition to these drastic reductions in pay, holidays, vacation accruals, sick leave, 
and retiree medical benefits have also been significantly reduced. 

US Airways employees have accepted up to  1⁄3 reductions in their standard of liv-
ing  in  a  very  short  period  of  time.  The  typical  middle  class  household  budget  does 
not  have  a  cushion  anywhere  close  to  1⁄3 of  take-home  pay;  to  be  able  to  adjust  to 
these kinds of reductions. Workers and their families are being forced into dramatic 
and  drastic  changes  that  affect  the  most  basic,  personal  decisions,  such  as  where 
to live, where and how to educate children, and making very hard choices regarding 
medical care. 

Many  employees  have  concluded  that  a  job  with  US  Airways  is  one  they  cannot 
afford to keep, and as a result, the company is facing manpower shortages in many 
locations.  This  difficulty  in  finding  employees  willing  to  accept  the  meager  wage 
scales  imposed  through  bankruptcy  is  what  caused  US  Airways’  Christmas  melt-
down  in  Philadelphia  last  year.  That  event  clearly  demonstrates  the  effect  of  low 
wages on the reliability of the industry. 
Hawaiian Airlines 

When Hawaiian Airlines approached its unions seeking concessions in an attempt 

to stay out of bankruptcy, the IAM stepped up to the plate. 

However,  the  company  failed  in  its  attempt  to  reorganize  outside  of  bankruptcy 
and filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in the spring of 2003. As part of the reorga-
nization,  a  Trustee  was  appointed  due  to  serious  concerns  on  the  part  of  creditors 
about actions taken by the prior CEO. 

The Trustee sought cost reductions of more than $1.5 million from IAM members. 
The IAM and the company ultimately reached an agreement in the fall of 2004. Be-
cause  of  the  sacrifices  made  by  IAM  members,  the  company  successfully  restruc-
tured and recently exited bankruptcy. 
Aloha Airlines 

In order to obtain $40 million in ATSB funds, employees at Aloha Airlines agreed 
to a 10 percent across the board pay cut in late 2002, designed to save the company 
$37  million  annually.  IAM  members  were  willing  to  make  these  sacrifices  to  keep 
Aloha out of bankruptcy. 

Despite these cuts, management was unable to turn the airline around. The com-
pany filed for Chapter 11 protection in December 30, 2004, and returned to employ-
ees  seeking  an  additional  10  percent  pay  cut,  on  top  of  the  cuts  agreed  to  just  two 
years  before,  as  well  as  reductions  in  health  benefits,  changes  to  work  rules,  and 
a freeze in benefit accruals under the company’s defined benefit pension plan. 

To  force  their  demand,  management  went  to  court  to  seek  abrogation  of  the  IAM 
contract. IAM members ratified a second round of concessions this past winter. De-
spite reducing pay by more than 20 percent, the airline continues to struggle to re-
organize. 
Air Wisconsin 

Air  Wisconsin  was  once  owned  by  United  Airlines,  but  for  many  years  has  oper-
ated  as  an  independent  express  carrier  for  United.  When  United  filed  for  bank-
ruptcy,  it  sought  to  restructure  contracts  with  its  express  feeders  and  as  a  result, 
in  2003,  Air  Wisconsin  came  to  its  employees  seeking  concessions.  IAM  fleet  and 
customer  service  members  agreed  to  significant  cuts  in  pay  and  benefits  in  order 
to preserve their jobs at the airline. 
Continental Airlines 

As part of a company-wide restructuring, Continental Airlines is seeking to reduce 
IAM-represented  flight  attendant  costs  by  $72  million  annually.  Discussions  with  a 
Federal mediator are being scheduled.

Alaska Airlines 

Alaska Airlines management has demanded concessions and even locked out near-
ly  500  IAM  ramp  service  members  in  Seattle,  WA.  By  outsourcing  our  members’ 
work  to  the  lowest  bidder,  Alaska  Airlines  now  ranks  dead  last  in  the  DOT’s  on- 
time  performance  ratings.  This  is  another  example  of  how  an  airline’s  short- 
sightedness is negatively impacting the reliability of our nation’s air transportation 
system. 
Northwest Airlines 

Northwest is also seeking significant cost savings from employees and termination 

of pension plans in a bid to avoid bankruptcy. 

Mr.  Chairman,  members  of  the  Committee,  the  financial  condition  of  the  airline 
industry  is  an  absolute  disaster.  Passengers  have  returned  since  9/11,  but  the  con-
tinued  reliance  on  failed  business  plans  jeopardizes  our  air  transportation  system. 
Southwest  Airlines  pays  their  employees  more  than  any  other  major  carrier,  yet 
remains profitable, so the industry’s problems are clearly not the result of high labor 
costs.  Nevertheless,  employees  have  given  more  than  their  fair  share,  yet  airlines 
are still struggling. Fuel prices are high, and employees are repeatedly asked to sub-
sidize artificially low ticket prices. 

The  industry  needs  new  ideas.  Airlines  can’t  continue  refusing  to  charge  at  least 

what it costs to provide their service and then claim financial emergencies. 

I urge this committee to explore ways to correct the suicidal pricing plaguing the 
industry.  Whether  it  be  a  mandatory  fuel  surcharge  or  other  government  interven-
tion, some re-regulation of the industry is clearly necessary. Left alone, airlines will 
price themselves out of existence. 

I thank the Committee for inviting us to participate in these proceedings and lis-

tening to our concerns. 

I look forward to your questions. 

Senator  BURNS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Roach,  for  your  testimony.  I’m 
interested, Senator DeMint, do you have a statement this morning? 
Thanks for coming. 

Senator DEMINT. Just wanted to listen. 
Senator BURNS. You’ve come to a great place. I mentioned in my 
opening  statement  and  the  reference  toward,  you  know  the  new 
carriers,  the  new  low-cost  carriers  and  Southwest  as  a  model  that 
so  far  has  been  very  profitable,  but  I  would  look  at  them  and  say 
well,  we  know  that  they  knew  how  to  handle  their  fuel  costs,  that 
over  time  will  run  out.  In  your  estimation,  Mr.  Roach,  how  long 
will it be that they will, before Southwest faces the same problems 
as say our legacy carriers? 

Mr. ROACH. Well, they are confronting the same problems today. 
Fuel  hedging  slowly  decreases  up  to  2009.  What  has  to  happen, 
and  I  believe  Southwest  management  is  working  toward  solutions 
as  they  go  along  and  managing  the  business  as  they  go  along  to 
be  prepared  for  that.  I  think  if  you  look  at  the  pricing  of  airline 
tickets on Southwest Airlines, versus US Airways or United, you’ll 
find that United and US Airways are charging less for tickets than 
Southwest Airlines, and so there is a serious problem. I think that 
we  work  with  Southwest  Airlines,  and  we  represent  10,000  people 
there.  We  work  with  them  to  craft  solutions  to  the  problems  that 
they  will  confront  beyond  2009,  such  as  ticketing  problems,  work-
ing  with  them  in  the  areas  of  helping  to  move  passengers  through 
the  airport,  and  having  efficiencies  in  place,  because,  again,  if  we 
are  going  to  have  $60  a  barrel  of  fuel,  we  can’t  just  act  like  it 
doesn’t exist. 

We  have  to  understand  it’s  going  to  exist.  We  have  to  look  at 
pricing of the ticket. Every Senator flew in here. When they got to 
a  cab  at  the  airport,  they  didn’t  pay  a  surcharge.  So  you  have  to 
price the profitability, and that’s what Southwest Airlines is doing.

41 

Senator BURNS. Mr. Baker, do you have a comment on that, how 
long  will  it  be  before  they  face  some  of  the  challenges  that  legacy 
carriers face? 

Mr.  BAKER.  Well,  I  would  echo  the  point  that  they  are  facing 
many of those problems today. Our analysis suggests that if not for 
their  hedge  protection  on  pricing,  on  fuel  pricing,  they  wouldn’t  be 
capable of producing profit in this economy, and while it’s a factual 
statement  that  their  labor  rates  are  above  the  industry  average, 
Southwest  management  now  concedes  that  that  puts  them  at  a 
competitive  disadvantage.  And  furthermore,  many  of  the  pricing 
changes  that  are  taking  place  at  the  legacy  level  have  negatively 
affected  Southwest’s  performance,  the  revenue  performance  in  cit-
ies  such  as  Fort  Lauderdale;  Hartford,  Connecticut  and  other  sec-
ondary cities. 

I would suggest that over the next several years, Southwest will 
have to tackle these issues. They have conceded that it will be dif-
ficult  to  achieve  wage  declines  because  those  declines  are  going  to 
have to take place if they are going to remain competitive with the 
further-improving legacy carriers. 

Senator  BURNS.  Well,  I  go  to  the  airports  right  now  and  I’ll  tell 
you  what,  I  have  never  seen  airports  more  full,  and  I  have  never 
seen Washington, D.C. so full of tourists since 9/11, so the travelers 
are  back.  As  I  mentioned  in  my  statement,  though,  I  come  from  a 
State  that  has  a  lot  of  tourist  dollars  and  recreational  flyers.  But 
we also have a very healthy network of business up there and I am 
concerned about the rural connectivity because of the financial con-
ditions of the legacy carriers. If it wasn’t for the hub-and-spoke sit-
uation,  well,  I  think  we  fall  into  a  situation  where  we  could  lose 
much  of  our  service  into  rural  areas.  I  initially  asked,  why  do  air-
lines  insist  that  it’s  so  expensive  to  operate  in  the  rural  markets? 
From what I can tell, the planes seem to be full, and I know what 
it  cost  me  to  fly  to  Billings,  Montana,  roundtrip.  You  could  make 
almost three round trips from Dulles to San Francisco. And I have 
a hard time justifying that, but I also know what the costs per mile 
are, and maybe what you’ve got to have, and you pretty much have 
to  have  a  face  in  every  window  whenever  that  airplane  leaves  the 
airport,  so  I’m  really  concerned  about  those  trends,  so  looking 
ahead,  Congress  has  provided  billions  of  dollars  of  direct  and  indi-
rect assistance to airlines, and they continue to lose money. Chair-
man Stevens and I were discussing how to refinance the FAA. And 
your  suggestions  today,  Mr.  May,  I  take  it  you  said  over  a  thou-
sand communication systems. Can you give me an example—— 

Mr. MAY. 14,000, Senator. And it’s extraordinary. We have an in-
frastructure  that’s  been  built  up  within  the  air  traffic  control  sys-
tem over the past 35 years that is more. 

Senator  BURNS.  Can  some  of  that  be  claimed  as  redundancy  in 

case of emergency? 

Mr.  MAY.  Some  of  it  can  be  claimed  as  redundancy  in  case  of 
emergency,  but  I  don’t  think  we  need  triple  and  quadruple 
redundancies, and I think that there is the capacity to do a transi-
tion—I  hate  to  use  this  phrase  before  this  committee,  but  transi-
tion  to  digital  that  might  be  particularly  appropriate  for  the  air-
lines. 

Senator BURNS. Appropriately delayed by the way.

Mr. MAY. I understand. 
Senator BURNS. Senator Inouye? 
Senator  INOUYE.  Listening  to  the  testimony,  I  gather  that  there 
are two major causes of the airlines’ current difficulties, fuel prices 
and  the  government,  taxes  and  fees.  Then  we  hear  the  word 
globalization. And my question is how do we, number one, compare 
to  the  operations  and  the  financial  conditions  of  airlines  abroad  in 
Europe and Asia, for example? Ms. Hecker or anyone else? 

Ms. HECKER. I think Mr. May may have more detail, but I think 
generally the studies that have been done is that the U.S. does not 
compare  favorably,  that  the  top  performing  carriers  because  they 
have a very high growth market in Asia, and there has been a view 
that  there  has  been  more  moderation  in  the  U.S.  in  making  the 
kinds  of  adaptations  to  the  new  market  environment  that,  for  ex-
ample, Asian carriers have and some have failed. It’s not as if they 
have  all  succeeded,  but  their  growth  rates,  their  efficiencies,  their 
business strategies have admittedly in a growth market been large-
ly successful. 

Mr.  MAY.  Senator  Inouye,  I  think  it’s  important  to  note  that 
there  are  some  very  fundamental  differences  between  some  of  the 
major  European  and  Pan-Asian  carriers,  and  those  here  in  the 
United States. They rely to a very great extent on long haul inter-
national routes. The major big six and so-called carriers here in the 
United States do a tremendous amount of domestic short-haul busi-
ness  here  in  the  United  States,  which  is  the  essence  of  the  hub- 
and-spoke system. As Senator Burns pointed out, without that hub- 
and-spoke  system,  we  wouldn’t  have  service  to  a  lot  of  small  and 
rural  communities  represented  by  this  committee  on  a  daily  basis, 
and the competitive nature of the low-cost carriers is frequently in 
that  domestic  business,  and  in  particular,  for  medium-sized  com-
munities  in  that  system.  So  that  the  85  percent  competitive  route 
structure  of  the  low-cost  carriers  with  legacy  carriers  is  having  a 
dramatic impact on domestic yields for our carriers. 

We  are  actually  doing  and  comparing,  very  favorably  with  the 
international carriers on our long-haul international routes, but as 
my friend Giovanni Bezziana would tell you, they have many of the 
same kinds of issues with taxes, fees, and fuel costs that we do. 

Mr. BAKER. Just to throw some numbers on top of that, Senator, 
for  example,  the  U.S.  carriers  75  percent  of  revenue  is  derived  in 
the  lower  48,  the  remainder  coming  in  longer  haul,  and  across  the 
oceans,  and  internationally.  For  European  carriers,  those  numbers 
aren’t  reversed  and  for  that  reason,  their  exposure  if  you  look  at 
British Airways or Lufthansa, their exposure to low-cost carriers is 
less, because they don’t fly those long-haul routes. That’s for a very 
good  reason.  The  low-cost  model,  which  is  a  low-labor  cost  model 
is  not  applicable  to  long  haul  travel.  That’s  the  reason  Southwest 
doesn’t fly across the ocean, nor does Jet Blue, so it’s a reversal of 
the portion of revenues that are expensed to low-cost carriers that, 
I  think,  in  large  part  explains  the  financial  difference  between  the 
two geographic sectors. 

Senator  INOUYE.  None  of  the  airlines  of  the  United  States  have 
any  government  ownership  interests,  but,  on  the  other  hand,  you 
take  Saudi  Airlines,  and  I  suppose  it’s  owned  by  the  family,  the 
government, Japan Airlines has a government interest in it, China

Airlines may be completely government-owned. Is that a level play-
ing field for us? 

Mr.  MAY.  Makes  it  particularly  difficult  for  us,  Senator  Inouye, 
but  it  is  the  reality  of  what  we  are  left  to  deal  with.  Nobody  ever 
said it was going to be a fair situation, and it does have an impact, 
but again, I think the biggest differences are not our ability to com-
pete  on  an  international  scale,  but  the  difficulties  we  have  with 
more domestic short haul. 

Senator  INOUYE.  An  additional  cost  has  been  imposed  upon  our 
citizens,  the  cost  of  security,  national  security,  and  for  example, 
airline  security  has  just  sky  rocketed.  In  Europe  and  Asia,  who 
pays for the security, airport security, for example, metal detectors? 
Mr. MAY. I’m not an expert on international security, but it’s my 
understanding  that  more  of  it  is  paid  by  the  government,  as  op-
posed  to  the  individual  carriers.  In  the  United  States,  we  pay  ei-
ther direct fees or mandated, indirect mandated costs, a billion dol-
lars a year for aviation security right now. 

Senator  INOUYE.  That’s  what  I  wanted  to  get  to,  because  re-
cently, it has been suggested that the airlines pay for airport secu-
rity.  And  I  don’t  think  that’s  the  case  in  Asia  and  Europe.  It’s  a 
matter of their national security, isn’t it, Mr. Baker? 

Mr. BAKER. That’s correct. I don’t have the figures in front of me, 
but  I  would  echo  Mr.  May’s  comments  that  overseas  governments 
tend  to  be  much  more  generous  in  terms  of  affording  that  level  of 
security  to  airports  and  passengers  than  here  in  the  states,  where 
it’s largely funded by the carriers out of ticket prices. 

Senator  INOUYE.  Mr.  Roach,  what  has  been  the  response  of  the 

Administration on your suggestion that there be a summit? 

Mr. ROACH. We had several meetings with Secretary Mineta. We 
visited  with  him  in  New  York  very  recently.  We  have  not  estab-
lished any summit meeting. While it has been favorably discussed, 
we have not had the meeting, and we think it’s important. 

Senator INOUYE. Are they open to your suggestion? 
Mr. ROACH. Yes. Secretary Mineta has been fair to establish, we 
talked  to  several  CEOs  of  several  carriers,  United,  US  Airways, 
Northwest  Airlines  and  they  all  seem  favorable  to  getting  it  done. 
We think that the Secretary of Transportation, or some government 
agency,  needs  to  call  the  meeting  and  then  we’ll  get  everybody  in 
the same room. We have had this on the Secretary’s plate. Similar 
meetings  have  been  fruitful,  but  we  think  it’s  important  to  get  ev-
erybody in the same room to start talking about these issues. 

Senator  INOUYE.  While  all  of  this  financial  condition  is  existing, 

what about equipment? Are we keeping up? 

Mr.  MAY.  Senator,  I  think  one  of  the  most  positive  messages  we 
can  deliver  to  this  committee  is  that  safety  in  particular  is  at  an 
all-time high. We have never had a more safe period in the history 
of  our  industry  than  we’ve  got  going  right  now,  and  I  think  that’s 
a  result  of  the  extraordinarily,  fine  cooperation  between  the  folks 
that  Mr.  Roach  represents  and  our  management,  because  no  mat-
ter how great our difficulties, we have worked together to that com-
mon  goal  of  keeping  safety  first,  and  we  have  got  some  extraor-
dinary  equipment  that  we  are  able  to  work  with  and  take  advan-
tage of.

STATEMENT OF HON. JIM DEMINT, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA 

Senator DEMINT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m just sitting here 
trying  to  sort  out  how  to  fix  this,  and  you  have  given  significant 
review of the problem, and I think we have heard that some of the 
problems—clearly  mismanagement  over  the  years,  as  Mr.  Roach 
talked  about  overreaching  during  good  times,  perhaps  not  making 
good decisions. We have also heard that labor used as considerable 
leverage over many years to push salaries and benefits way beyond 
sustainable levels. 

We  have  heard  about  the  waste  of  FAA  and  problems  with  fuel 
costs, taxes and fees, and you know, my inclination is to say maybe 
we  should  sit  back  and  let  the  market  try  to  fix  this,  but  I  do  see 
the  government’s  hand  in  this  and  we  perhaps  intertwined  to  let 
it  go.  But  it  doesn’t  seem  with  all  of  what  we  have  seen  with  the 
industry  management,  the  labor  that  the  government  should  come 
in  and  just  try  to  fix  this  problem  because  we  can.  I’d  just  like  to 
hear more from some of our witnesses of, I mean I don’t know how 
we can sustain an airline industry with so many losses. 

I’m  perplexed  at  how  it  continues  to  attract  capital.  And  this  is 
seeing something where the market really needs to work here, and 
much less government, but I’d be interested in any comments that 
you have on what the government should do at this point. 

Mr.  MAY.  Senator—I’ll  jump  in  here  and  I  know  Mr.  Roach  has 

some ideas, too. Mr. Baker said a minute ago—— 

Senator  BURNS.  Jim,  pull  your  microphone  a  little,  would  you 

Mr.  MAY.  Thank  you,  sir.  Mr.  Baker  said  the  market  for  Conti-
nental  and  American,  except  for  fuel,  would  have  been  the  most 
profitable  quarters  they  have  had  in  the  history  of  the  business, 
and  I  think  the  productivity  gains  that  we  are  making,  all  of  the 
changes  that  are  taking  place  in  the  industry,  and  we  make  no 
bones  we  have  been  less  than  perfect  in  managing  the  business 
over  the  years,  I  think  all  of  those  changes  have  been  extraor-
dinary, and are leading to sustained profitability. 

Once we begin to address the uncontrolled costs, those costs over 
which  we  don’t  have  any  control  and  they  are  fuel,  which  has  had 
a  dramatic  impact  on  our  business,  taxes  and  fees,  and  unfunded 
mandates,  we  spend  $50  billion  a  year  for  an  industry  that  only 
earns roughly 80. But here in the United States on taxes and fees, 
security  mandates,  so  on  and  so  forth.  So  I  would  love  to  sit  down 
with  Mr.  Roach  and  bring  our  CEOs  together  and  talk  about  how 
we  need  to  reform  the  air  traffic  control  system,  how  we  need  to 
reduce the impact of taxes and fees, and Senator, if you’ve got some 
magic  for  $60  oil,  I  want  to  hear  it,  because  we  are  at  wit’s  end. 
Mr.  ROACH.  It  would  be  nice  to  let  the  market  take  care  of  the 
situation,  but  the  market  does  not  take  care  of  it.  For  example, 
United Airlines and US Airways are currently in Chapter 11 insu-
lated from the market and everybody else, Northwest, Delta, Conti-

please.

nental, the other carriers, Southwest are now paying bills, and this 
is—the  court  is  now  running  those  through  airlines.  So  if  you  can 
stay into Chapter 11 for 3 years and not go to the government and 
dump your pension plans, then the market is not taking care of the 
situation.  It  is  the  government,  it  is  the  courts  causing  the  North-
west,  Delta,  everybody  else  to  now  follow  suit,  but  the  protection 
has  been  given  through  the  law  on  the  Chapter  11,  so  it  is  again, 
I  think,  very  important  that  we  try  to  grab  solutions  collectively. 
I don’t want to sit in the room and negotiate contracts with every-
body. 

We  need  to  sit  down  and  figure  out  what  it  is  we  are  going  to 
do  collectively  working  with  the  government.  I  don’t  want  the  gov-
ernment  to  come  in  and  mandate  what  we  should  do.  We  should 
have  solutions,  and  we  should  have  some  input  from  a  govern-
mental  agency  as  to  what  the  industry  can  do  to  fix  it  and  work 
together. 

Mr.  BAKER.  Senator,  the  testimony  that  I  submitted  today  dealt 
with the issue of pension reform for the airlines. I think if carriers 
were seeking something to symbol as a handout, if you would, they 
would follow the precedent set by United Airlines. File Chapter 11, 
rid themselves of their obligations and put those obligations at the 
expense of workers to the government and to taxpayers. That to me 
smacks of subsidization. What certain carriers and lawmakers have 
proposed  is  simply  allowing  the  carriers  more  time  to  make  good 
on  promises  they  have  already  made,  and,  therefore,  substantially 
diminish in my opinion the near-term risk of bankruptcy. 

To  me,  this  is  a  proposal  that  would  potentially  be  less  burden-

some on workers and taxpayers. 

Ms.  HECKER.  If  I  can  just  add  one  point;  that  there  is  no  doubt 
that  pensions  are  an  extremely  serious  issue.  GAO,  though,  has 
done work widespread across the economy and the issue of pension 
underfunding,  and  pensions  pushing  liquidity  problems  on  many 
industries is not exclusively a problem of the airline industry. And 
our  work  has  vigorously  called  for  broad  and  comprehensive  pen-
sion  reform  that  fixes  the  problems  that  the  current  system  has 
created,  both  in  this  industry,  and  many  others,  where  we  have  a 
nationwide severe crisis in the entire defined benefits system. 

Senator DEMINT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator  BURNS.  If  it’s  anything  that’s  getting  our  attention  in 
this town right now is a situation we find with these pensions. This 
has the possibility of impacting the American taxpayer, to a greater 
extent  than  the  S&Ls,  and  there  are  some  folks  up  here  that  are 
very, very concerned about that, especially in the situation, and in 
light of our budgetary problems now, and I’m very, very concerned 
about  it,  and  even  though  as  your  testimony  would  signify  that 
only  6  percent  of  the  operating  is  of  their  total  overall  operating 
capital is impacted by the pensions, and that sounds greater to me 
than the figures would indicate. 

Mr. ROACH. The issue of pensions, I’d like to say on behalf of our 
organization is that we saw this problem in 2000. This is not a new 
problem,  and  we  went  to  the  airlines  and  said  this  is  a  problem. 
You’re  not  in  the  pension  business.  Let’s  sit  down  and  work  this 
out.  And  they  refused.  Why  they  refused—because  under  current 
pension  law  you  didn’t  have  to  make  any  contributions  to  those

pension plans, but this is not just something that happened yester-
day. We saw the problem coming and we said let’s fix the problem 
before it becomes a crisis, and again because of the law, you’re able 
to  push  these  payments  back  and  then  all  of  a  sudden  they  were 
due.  The  bill  came  due  and  he  couldn’t  pay  it  so  again,  and  I  may 
sound  like  a  broken  record,  we  need  to  sit  in  a  room  together  to 
figure  out  what  to  do  next,  because  how  do  we  address  this  prob-
lem in 2000, I suggested by the Machinists Union we would not be 
here today. Believe me. 

Senator BURNS. Can I suggest to you that the same thing is true 
in  Social  Security,  Mr.  Roach,  and  we  are  not  getting  much  re-
sponse from anybody to fix that report before it becomes uncontrol-
lable  and  cannot  be  fixed.  But  then,  as  you  well  know,  we  all  got 
ingrained in all of us here in this country that nobody gets excited. 
I  can  go  down  to  your  farm  and  tell  you  you’re  going  to  have  to 
repaint  your  barn  in  2015,  do  you  want  to  sign  the  contract  now. 
I  doubt  that  you  would  do  that.  And  that’s,  that’s  the  American 
people,  but  right  now,  the  cry  has  gone  out—we  have  to  fix  these 
other  funds,  but  nobody  wants  to  do  that  now,  but  they  will  when 
those  checks  are  2  weeks  late  or  they  are  halved  in  two.  Senator 
Lautenberg. 

STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Thanks,  Mr.  Chairman.  I’m  sorry  that  I 
wasn’t  here  earlier.  As  everyone  knows,  there  are  always  com-
peting committees, and this one ranks very high on my agenda, but 
the  other  one  had  to  deal  with  chemical  safety,  and  in  my  State 
of New Jersey, we worry about those things. Honestly, I also worry 
about the airlines. The service that commercial aviation provides to 
our  country  and  our  world  is  essential.  The  expansion  that  this 
country  has  had  over  the  years  would  never  have  been  possible 
were  it  not  for  the  availability  of  commercial  air  service,  so  I  look 
with considerable misgivings about what might happen in the avia-
tion  industry  if  the  price  of  oil  and  other  expenses  continue  to  in-
crease. 

However, I’d like to ask a couple of questions that relate particu-
larly to the pension problem. I come out of industry. I ran a pretty 
good-sized company, a company that I started with two others and 
now  has  40,000  employees.  We  had  a  lot  of  experience  in  running 
the company and managing the works, and I know one thing: pen-
sion  plans  are  under  assault  like  the  Chairman  mentioned.  Lord 
knows  where  we  go  in  terms  of  satisfying  the  belief  that  people 
have that if they work for Company A or Company B and they had 
a  pension  plan  and  that  20,  25  years  later  they  could  go  on  with 
life and their families. Unfortunately, many are not able to do that. 
And  it’s  not  particular  to  the  aviation  industry.  It’s  also  true  in 
other  industries,  especially  manufacturing  industries  throughout 
our country. 

And so I must ask the question—kind of a generic question—that 
is: did everybody get treated equally when it came to protecting the 
pensions  of  employees  in  view  of  either  credit  reorganizations  or 
bankruptcies?  Are  executive  pension  plans  better  funded  than  em-
ployee  plans?  Are  executives  taking  the  same  heat  that  rank-and-

file employees take? Did they run the same risks as not being able 
to  get  their  pensions  protected?  Mr.  May,  can  you  comment  on 
that? 

Mr.  MAY.  My,  I  am  not  an  expert  on  the  issue,  Senator  Lauten-
berg.  I  will  offer  two  brief  observations,  and  would  be  happy  to  do 
some  research  and  come  back  to  more  specifics,  obviously.  My 
sense  is  that  defined  benefit  plans,  no  matter  how  they  are  con-
structed or who they are for, are facing some very real and signifi-
cant  difficulties,  and  it’s  not  just  in  the  airline  businesses.  As  you 
have  pointed  out,  I  was  with  somebody  from  General  Motors  the 
other day, and there are a number of concerns across industry. 

As  to  compensation  for  our  executives,  I  think  it  has  been 
slashed  significantly  across  the  board.  I  think  there  are  very  few 
of  our  executives  that  are  coming  anywhere  close  to  their  peers  in 
other  industries  to  compensation.  As  to  whatever  specific  retire-
ment  plans  that  those  executives  may  have,  I  don’t  happen  to  be 
privy  to  those.  I  know  most  of  it,  I  think  you’d  be  far  more  expert 
in  this  than  I,  are  filed  in  disclosures  with  the  SEC,  and  I  know 
it’s  public  information,  and  I  would  suspect  that  we  could  find  the 
answer to that question there. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Mr. Roach, how do you see it? 
Mr. ROACH. Well, traditional pension plans both executives have, 
which  was  shown  in  American  Airlines  when  they  had  pay  cuts 
and  $45  million  put  aside  in  special  funds  for  their  executives.  I 
think  there  has  been  testimony  in  other  hearings  that  there  are 
bonus payments that are made. They don’t call them pensions. But 
you  are  talking  about  millions  of  millions  of  dollars  that  go  to  ex-
ecutives,  while  employees  pension  benefit  plans  are  being  cut.  It’s 
not a level playing field. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  I  just  wonder  whether  reserving  pension 
plans  or  termination  programs  for  executives  has  in  any  way  im-
paired the airline’s ability to have some additional funding, in addi-
tion  to  the  pain  and  the  trauma  that  it  causes  for  employees  who 
have worked and depended on these pensions for a long time. 

Mr.  ROACH.  Not  only  does  it  affect  the  current  employee,  it  af-
fects the retired employee. The employee that is retired is expected 
an  amount  of  health  care,  health  care  costs  have  increased  in  cer-
tain cases, but employee who has depended on a dollar amount for 
months. It has been very difficult as we create a lot of morale prob-
lems at the airlines because employees were planning to retire. As 
you  move  the  older  employee  out,  younger  employees  come,  it  also 
reduced  costs.  So  it  causes  employees  to  stay  around  and  work 
longer. 

It  has  created  a  lot  of  serious  problems  with  people  again  being 
focused,  and  that  goes  back  to  the  question  of  security.  Employees 
must  be  focused  at  airports.  They  should  not  be  focused  about 
should  I  pay  my  mortgage.  They  have  to  be  focused  on  the  trav-
eling  passengers,  as  well  as  employees.  I  think  there  is  a  serious 
problem.  A  lot  of  times  in  this  country  you  don’t  want  to  confront 
things  until  there  is  a  crisis,  and  I  certainly  agree  with  them  and 
that’s  why  today  we  have  proposals  with  Continental  Airlines  and 
Northwest  Airlines  to  fix  their  pension  plans  in  coordination  with 
some  of  their  ideas  that  we  have  to  fix  the  plans.  We  have  to  bite

the  bullet.  We  have  to  do  what  is  necessary  to  get  these  problems 
fixed. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  ask  if  you  would 
consider  one  of  these  days  having  a  hearing  specifically  on  this 
question. I think it’s important to find out what kind of obligations 
the Pension Guaranty Fund is going to have. It could be enormous, 
and I don’t know what we do at that point. 

Senator  BURNS.  I  would  say  to  my  friend  that  that  is  not  under 
jurisdiction  of  this  committee,  but  it  sure  has  an  effect  on  how  we 
set policy for our airlines. I’ll guarantee you that. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Information  search  would  be  a  good  idea 
if  we  could  do  it.  I  would  ask  whether  recent  events  have  effected 
equally the lower-cost carriers versus the legacy carriers. The com-
petition  is  robust,  as  I  see  from  some  of  the  financial  statements. 
Some  of  the  regional  and  the  smaller  airlines  seem  to  be  able  to 
weather this storm better. Is that true, Mr. May? 

Mr. MAY. Yes, sir, it is. And let’s maybe try and divide the busi-
ness  into  three  parts.  The  regional  carriers  are  either  wholly 
owned,  or  have  significant  operating  relationships  with  the  major 
carriers,  and  they  have  been  earning  profits  for  some  reasonable 
period  of  time  because  they  effectively  have  a  guaranteed  income 
because of the contractual relationships they have with their broth-
ers. 

The  Independence  Airs  and  the  smaller  low-cost  carriers  are, 
Robert  has  pointed  out  Southwest  is  a  prime  example,  have  had  a 
mixed  bag.  Independence  Air,  I  think  it  will  come  as  no  surprise 
reading  the  papers,  is  losing  a  very  significant  amount  of  money. 
Herb  Kelleher,  who  is  on  my  board  and  a  great  contributor  to  our 
industry,  has  made  it  abundantly  clear  that  if  it  weren’t  for  the 
fact  he  has  hedged  at  $26  for  oil,  he  would  have  lost  money  over 
the  last  year  or  so.  And  although  he  has  hedges  that  aren’t  quite 
as  favorable  going  forward,  they  rise  up  into  the  40s.  A  40-some 
dollar  hedge  looks  awfully  attractive  when  oil  is  trading  on  the 
Nynex  at  60,  so  I  think  there  is  a  mixed  bag  among  the  low-cost 
carriers,  but  they  are  being  impacted  as  well  as  our  carriers  are, 
although  it’s  easy  to  point  out  that  the  costs  for  the  seat  model  is 
lower  for  those  carriers.  I  think  Mr.  Baker  is  the  bigger  expert  in 
this area. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  I  would  be  interested  in  your  comments, 
Mr.  Baker.  In  terms  of  the  financial  viability,  does  the  industry’s 
structure  permit  the  legacy  carriers  whom  we  desperately  need,  to 
survive  through  these  drops  and  these  periods  of  high-cost  oper-
ating expenses? 

Mr. BAKER. I believe most of them are well on the way to ensur-
ing  them  whether  it  will  allow  them  to  endure  the  business.  I 
would  point  out  that  in  the  first  quarter  of  this  year,  if  we  just 
strip  out  fuel  expense  from  both  sub-sectors,  low-cost  carriers  and 
legacy carriers, we actually witnessed the first year-on-year decline 
in  low-cost  carrier  profitability  in  several  years,  whereas  non-fuel 
profits,  if  you  will,  of  legacy  carriers,  were  up  in  excess  of  25  per-
cent,  and  the  reason  we  witnessed  the  decline  in  low-cost  carrier 
profits  is  because  it  coincides  with  these  recovery  efforts  with  the 
legacy  carriers,  choosing  to  no  longer  fall  back  and  instead  stand 
their ground and compete more effectively with these carriers.

There  is  no  question  in  my  mind,  Senator,  that  a  significant  re-
invention  of  legacy  cost  structure  is  under  way.  It’s  just  that  that 
reinvention  is  being  masked  right  now  by  the  escalation  of  crude 
prices. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Mr.  May,  Mr.  Chairman—I’ll  conclude 
with  this.  I  assume  that  you  look  at  the  air  traffic  control  system 
and  see  how  it’s  functioning.  I  think  it  functions  very,  very  well, 
but I am concerned about the anticipated controller retirements, as 
well as the increase in volume of flights as we go to more regional 
jets,  more  activity  in  the  air.  We  need  a  lot  of  space  for  military 
uses,  et  cetera,  and  the  air  space  is  not  infinite.  How  will  carriers 
be  affected?  Have  you  looked  at  that,  sir,  in  terms  of  what  the  fi-
nancial impact might be? Perhaps longer delays and problems that 
the FAA might not be able to quickly find solutions for? 

Mr. MAY. Senator Lautenberg, I think as I said in my oral testi-
mony,  we  should  take  the  current  ATC  system  and  retire  it  to  the 
Smithsonian,  where  it  can  be  admired  as  one  of  the  marvels  of 
1950s  technology.  It  is  capable  of  handling  the  traffic  we  have 
today.  It  is  fully  incapable  of  handling  the  traffic  for  the  future. 
One  example,  Net  Jets,  has  well  over  600  aircraft.  They  are  flying 
in and out of Teterborough in your state. That’s a phenomenon. We 
have  ultralight  jets  on  the  horizon.  We  have  any  of  a  number  of 
regional carriers that are putting more planes into the system, and 
fewer of the larger 57s, 67s, et cetera, so I think we have got a very 
significant  problem  on  our  hands  in  the  future,  and  we  are  going 
to  need  to  seriously  engage  in  making  it  an  exercise  in  difficult 
choices  to  make  some  fundamental  change  to  this  system  from  top 
to bottom. 

We  have  got  to  go  to  a  fully-digital  GPS-based  system  that  can 

handle the traffic that’s coming our way. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Mr.  Chairman,  an  observation  that  I 
would  like  to  be  permitted  to  make  is  that  I  always  believed  that 
FAA  should  be  operating  similar  to  companies  where  the  CEO  is 
employed to do a job over a period of time, regardless of what polit-
ical  party  is  in  place  or  that  kind  of  thing.  An  organization  where 
the mission is professionalized and we thanked the people doing it. 
We  have  good  FAA  people,  but  the  fact  of  the  matter  is  one  of  the 
reasons  the  system  is  so  antiquated,  and  when  we  try  to  change 
it,  there  are  discontinuities  created  along  the  way.  We  have  spent 
billions  of  dollars  with  some  of  the  top  agencies  in  the  country  in 
trying  to  reform  the  air  traffic  control  system,  and  every  time  we 
had  a  start,  we  run  out  of  cash.  It  is  a  system,  and  it  works  sur-
prisingly  well,  but  it’s  in  overload  mode  most  of  the  time.  Thanks, 
Mr. Chairman. Thank you all very much. 

Mr. MAY. Senator, if I might be permitted, I know this is heresy, 
but  if  we  could  have  maybe  the  Congress  of  the  United  States 
spend  a  little  less  time  micromanaging  the  details  of  the  FAA  as 
to  where  ILS  systems  are  going,  and  so  on,  and  so  forth,  and  ear-
marks, it would probably operate a lot more efficiently. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Shocking suggestion. 
Senator BURNS. It is heresy. Let’s go over three areas. There are 
some areas of confusion, and in the area of Chapter 11 bankruptcy, 
I  think  we  have  kind  of  ironed  that  out  this  morning.  Buying  new 
aircraft.  Yesterday  I  read  the  testimony  of  all  that  are  here  today,

Mr.  Roach’s  testimony  questions  the  purchasing  of  new  aircraft  by 
struggling  air  carriers.  Do  any  of  you  refute  that  argument,  or  are 
there  long-term  gains  on  that  investment?  Do  we  talk  about  effi-
ciency,  or  is  it  just  a  bad  business  decision  when  we  start  talking 
about the replacement of equipment? 

Mr. ROACH. I think my testimony is the timing. You have to pur-
chase new aircraft and you have, because there is more aircraft, it 
becomes  less  efficient,  other  aircraft  becomes  less  efficient  and  it 
can’t  be  maintained  when  companies  can’t  pay  their  bills  and  or-
dering new aircraft, it’s a timing issue. 

Mr.  MAY.  I  think  the  other  factor  that’s  important,  Mr.  Chair-
man,  is  that  I  think  our  carriers,  in  particular  the  larger  carriers, 
have  learned  a  very  good  lesson  from  Southwest.  Southwest  has  a 
single  type  of  aircraft,  737.  They  are  all  effectively  identical  with 
the  exception  of  the  paint  colors  on  the  outside,  and  so  they  have 
managed their fleet in a very effective way. 

I think what we are seeing today is that many of the legacy car-
riers  are  significantly  reducing  the  numbers  of  different  airplanes 
in  their  fleet,  and  they  are  trying  to  upgrade,  as  Mr.  Roach  says, 
from  a  fuel  efficiency  point  of  view.  I  was  with  Boeing  on  Monday 
of  this  week  up  in  Hartford,  Connecticut,  we  were  talking  about 
the  787  which  is  the  most  fuel  efficient  aircraft  ever  designed,  I 
think, and we are all looking for those efficiencies in our fleets, and 
we  laid  literally  hundreds  of  aircraft  down  in  the  desert  to  get  rid 
of older, less fuel efficient planes and bringing in more fuel efficient 
planes, so it is a process of renewal and standardization that is im-
portant for the industry. 

Senator  BURNS.  On  the  efficiency  part  of  these  new  airplanes,  is 
there anywhere we can go to see what the airlines use to measure 
the payout or the return on investment, as far as efficiency is con-
cerned?  I  say  that  because  we  are  dealing  with  some  new  tech-
nologies here on this committee with regard to lighting. 

When you look at optical lighting, that these old light bulbs that 
we see here today are on their last legs. A lot of people don’t realize 
that,  and  you  see  this  optical  lighting  showing  up  in  our  traffic 
lights  more  than  anywhere  else.  They  use  from  30  to  40  percent 
less  electricity.  So  the  payout,  or  the  payback,  for  that  investment 
is  rather  large.  Do  we  see  this  kind  of  a  situation  in  the  aircraft 
that’s  coming  onboard  now  from  the  787  or  other  types  of  aircraft 
that’s being introduced? 

Mr.  MAY.  I’m  sure  in  our  engineering  team,  along  with  Boeing 
or  Airbus  engineering  teams  would  be  happy  to  provide  you  and 
this committee with background. 

Senator BURNS. Now in the area of leasing, some in the industry 
have been critical for the role aircraft leasers have been playing by 
providing  outside  cash  and  loan  support.  What  role,  good  or  bad, 
do  you  think  this  section  of  the  industry  is  having,  and  what  do 
you see their future role, how will they evolve in the future? What 
role will they play? Mr. Baker, you’re probably in a better position 
to address that. 

Mr.  BAKER.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  one  thing  that  really  sepa-
rates  the  current  airline  crisis  from  that  which  followed  the  first 
Gulf  War,  and  that  being  of  somewhat  less  significance,  is  in  fact 
the rise of leasing companies. We were unable to witness the num-

ber  of  actual  liquidations,  names  like  Eastern,  Banff,  carriers  no 
longer  with  us,  and  the  removal  of  their  capacity  played  a  role  in 
the resurrection or the return to profitability that we witnessed for 
all carriers during the mid-1990s. 

I  think  the  role  of  the  leasing  community  is  largely  what  is  pre-
venting  any  liquidations  from  taking  place,  so  I  do  think  it  is  yet 
another example of a barrier to exit, and the airline industry is no-
torious in terms of there being very few barriers to entry. You and 
I  are  free  to  start  an  airline  with  surprisingly  little  red  tape  and 
capital  requirement  for  us  to  actually  start  an  airline,  and  then 
ceasing  to  operate  that  airline  is  entirely  different.  That  said,  the 
leasing community clearly has to be mindful of the overall value of 
the  demand  for  aircraft  globally,  which  is  why  leasing  companies 
such  as  GE  are  in  fact  playing  an  important,  and  critical  role  in 
the  resurrection  of  carriers,  the  redesign  of  carriers  such  as  Delta 
Airlines. They are now both a potential or an actual barrier to exit, 
but they are also aiding the recovery efforts of these carriers. 

Senator  BURNS.  Tell  me  about  in  the  airline  industry.  Why  is  it 
still  attracting  capital  even  though  it  has  a  very  poor  performance 
record? 

Mr.  MAY.  Senator,  that’s  a  great  question,  and  I  wish  I  had  the 
answer  for  it.  I  can’t  remember  the  exact  number,  but  there  is 
something on the order of 16 to 20 applications resting at the FAA 
for  people  coming  into  the  business,  as  tough  as  it  is,  and  as  hor-
rible a record as it is, right now. 

Ms.  HECKER.  I  think  your  interest  in  the  role  of  manufacturers 
and  lessors  is  right  where  the  answers  are,  though.  Those  firms 
have  been  making  money  for  a  number  of  years,  so  they  are  play-
ing  the  role,  yes,  in  some  recovery,  but  they  are  also  keeping  the 
capacity  in  the  system,  despite  the  limited  pricing  power,  so  it’s  a 
dynamic that is a very important one in the sector. 

Senator  BURNS.  That  tells  me  that  I  should  be  selling  baggage 
carts  rather  than  investing  in  the  airline  stock.  Is  that,  everybody 
is making money but the airline, right? 

Mr. ROACH. Historically in its business everybody connected with 
the  airline,  with  caterers,  people  that  sell,  lease  airplanes,  fix  air-
planes.  They  all  make  money.  It’s  the  airline  industry  itself  that 
doesn’t make money. You’re 100 percent right. 

Senator BURNS. We’ll have to look into that, I suppose. I started 
out  there,  when  I  came  out  of  the  Marine  Corps,  I  worked  for  an 
airline.  Now,  the  $64,000  question.  That’s  not  very  much.  Looking 
at the debt, looking at the asset-to-debt ratio, how much more time 
have we got before they are all in Chapter 11? 

Mr. MAY. Senator, how much longer are we going to have $60 oil, 
and is it going to go to $70? I think you can measure the successful 
livelihood of the business in great measure with the price of oil. It’s 
that important to the equation. 

Senator  BURNS.  That  we  have  very  little  control  of  right  now. 
Right  now  China  and  there  are  a  lot  of  foreign  countries  that  are 
in  the  oil  business,  and  are  driving  oil  prices  right  now.  But  I 
would say on the other hand in Sydney, Montana, I don’t see many, 
and Williston, North Dakota, if you know what I mean. 

Mr. BAKER. Senator, I would suggest, barring a material price in 
crude or material pension relief, Northwest and Delta will be facing

Chapter  11  decisions  within  the  next  6  months.  Other  carriers  are 
in  better  positions  in  terms  of  liquidity  profiles,  like  Continental. 
I  would  suggest  if  nothing  changed,  if  revenue  trends  stopped  im-
proving,  if  fuel  costs  stayed  precisely  where  they  are  at  the  pump 
today,  that  Continental  would  be  facing  a  Chapter  11  decision 
sometime toward the end of 2006, beginning of 2007, and American 
once they went through the actions consistent with a carrier trying 
to avoid the process, so selling off key assets what have you, mak-
ing  an  additional  return  to  labor  for  another  contribution  there, 
they would be facing a late 2007, or late 2008, bankruptcy decision. 

Senator BURNS. Is consolidation an answer? 
Mr.  BAKER.  I  don’t  happen  to  believe  that  it  is.  I  think  that  the 
America West-USAir example is probably the first and last signifi-
cant form of consolidation that, that type of consolidation that we’ll 
see  for  sometime.  I  do  believe  that  over  time,  assets  belonging  to 
failing  carriers  as  they  exit  the  industry,  they  will,  will  ultimately 
emerge  with  fewer  airlines,  but  I  think  it’s  more  likely  to  occur  if 
and  when  failures  take  place  than  through  traditional  M&A  activ-
ity.  Every  airline  cycle,  for  example,  is  accompanied  by  the  loss  of 
certain  hubs  after  the  first  Gulf  War.  We  lost  National  as  a  hub. 
We  lost  Raleigh-Durham.  We  lost  San  Jose.  This  time  around  we 
have lost Columbus, we have lost another iteration of Raleigh-Dur-
ham, and I would suggest going forward, somewhere down the road 
5, 10 years, hubs like Memphis, Cleveland and Salt Lake would be 
on my short list. 

Mr.  ROACH.  Senator,  I  think  that  the  mergers  and  acquisitions, 
first  of  all,  exit  to  the  industry  has  been  very  difficult  because  of 
less  service  and  Chapter  11,  and  people  could  hang  on.  We  show 
a  number  of  airlines  leaving:  TWA,  American,  Banff.  There  are  a 
lot of airlines and 16 or 17 applications to start new airlines. 

We talked about the Social Security crisis, the people not willing 
to address their problem. We are there in this industry. We are at 
a  crisis  in  this  industry.  There  is  no  putting  it  off  until  tomorrow. 
Something  has  to  get  done.  It  has  to  get  done  now.  Otherwise,  we 
are going to see several more airlines in Chapter 11 before the year 
is over. 

Senator  BURNS.  The  other  members  have  questions,  and  we’ll 
submit  those  questions  to  you  for  written  response,  and  if  you’ll 
copy  in  the  Committee  with  those  responses,  we  would  appreciate 
that.  Thank  you  for  coming  today.  I  think  overall  we  got  a  pretty 
good picture of our challenges. We didn’t talk about taxes and fees 
enough,  but  I  think  there  is  some  work  that  the  GAO  has  done, 
and  the  information  that  all  of  you  have  given  us,  especially  from 
Mr. May’s office, where I think we are going to take a look at that, 
and  we  are  going  to  make  an  argument  for  taxes  and  fees  right 
now  are  a  significant  part.  I  think  there  is  also  an  awareness  now 
that  even  in  security  as  the  war  on  terror  and  as  it  becomes  our 
enemy,  that  we  can’t  protect  everybody,  because  Americans  are  a 
mobile  society.  And  anything  that  infringes  on  that  freedom  of 
movement  is  looked  upon  as  not  very  good  for  our  society.  We  are 
going  to  have  to  take  a  look  at  our  mass  transit  and  our  other 
transportation  facilities,  one  of  these  days  we  are  going  to  have  to 
look  at  the  security  of  this  country,  and  it  was  suggested  up  in 
Montana the other day that we had volunteers.

We decided to send forces in two different ways in World War II 
to wage that war, and we left our own country vulnerable. And I’m 
saying  we  may  be  in  the  same  situation,  but  there  were  voluntary 
groups, people volunteered to keep our country safe, and for obser-
vations  and  to  respond  to  local  emergencies.  We  may  have  to  go 
back  to  that  because  we  cannot,  as  a  government,  levy  enough 
taxes  to  pay  for  all  of  it.  And  so  I  think  you  know  there  are  a  lot 
of us up here that are taking a different view of what our priorities 
are, especially in this area of transportation and keeping it secure. 
Thank  you  for  coming  this  morning.  We’ll  leave  the  record  open 
for a couple of weeks. If you’ll respond to those questions, why, we 
would appreciate that.
