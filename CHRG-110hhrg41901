Manage Modern Refuse in the

Digital Age?

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 30, 2008

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On  April  30,  2008  the  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  will  hold  a  hearing
on  the  management  of  waste  electronic  equipment  (e-waste)  in  the  United  States.
Witnesses  will  discuss  industry  practices  for  recycling,  refurbishment,  re-sale  and
disposal  of  electronic  products  and  the  challenges  associated  with  end-of-life  man-
agement of electronic products.

The hearing will also examine the potential of research and development in green
design  efforts  to  make  recycling  easier  and  decrease  the  amount  of  toxic  material
used in electronic products, as well as in creating frameworks for understanding the
economic and environmental impacts of reuse and recycling.

The  Committee  will  hear  testimony  from  six  witnesses  offering  perspectives  from
the electronics manufacturing sector, the recycling industry, a non-profit service pro-
vider and academic research and development.
Witnesses

• Mr.  Gerardo  Castro  is  the  Director  of  Contracts  and  Environmental  Serv-
ices,  Goodwill  Industries  of  Southern  California,  Los  Angeles,  California.  Mr.
Castro  will  discuss  the  scope  and  magnitude  of  e-waste  in  this  country,  as
well  as  the  volume  of  electronic  products  received  by  Goodwill  Industries  an-
nually and their product recycling, refurbishing, and re-sale operations.

• Ms. Renee St. Denis is the Director of America’s Product Take-Back and Re-
cycling  for  Hewlett-Packard  Company.  Ms.  St.  Denis  will  discuss  the  origin
and  history  of  HP’s  take-back  and  recycling  program  and  how  it  has  influ-
enced  product  design.  She  will  also  discuss,  from  HP’s  perspective,  the  types
of innovations that are needed to promote electronic product recyclability and
the increased use of recycled materials.

• Mr.  Eric  Harris  is  the  Associate  Counsel  and  Director  of  Government  and
International  Affairs  for  the  Institute  of  Scrap  Recycling  Industries  (ISRI).

cling industry, and options for reducing the environmental impacts of this in-
dustry.

Background

Electronic  waste  (e-waste)  is  the  term  used  to  describe  electronic  products  at  the
end of their useful lives. This includes: computers, televisions, VCRs, stereos, print-
ers,  cell  phones,  fax  machines,  copiers,  and  other  commonly  used  electronic  prod-
ucts. The use and production of these products is integral to the digital age and our
economy.  However,  due  to  product  failure  or  the  desire  to  purchase  more  advanced
technology, the number of discarded electronic products is rapidly increasing. Indeed
the lifespan of some of this equipment is as short as 18 to 24 months. The National
Safety Council1 estimated that over 499 million personal computers became obsolete
between  1997  and  2004  and  the  Government  Accountability  Office  estimates  that
100  million  televisions,  computers,  and  monitors  become  obsolete  each  year.2 With
the  fast  rate  of  technology  improvement  and  the  rate  that  many  industrializing
countries will soon also be discarding large numbers of used electronics, the volume
of e-waste globally stands to grow substantially.

There  currently  is  no  specific  federal  law  or  regulation  governing  the  disposal  of
consumer electronic products in the United States. In 2000, the National Electronic
Products Stewardship Initiative (NEPSI) brought stakeholders together in an effort
to  create  a  consensus  on  the  shape  of  a  national  e-waste  management  framework.
This process stalled in 2004 when stakeholders could not agree on a financing mech-
anism  for  a  product  take-back  system.  Due  to  the  presence  of  toxic  materials  like
lead  and  mercury,  several  states  now  mandate  end-of-life  electronic  product  man-
agement.  The  patchwork  of  State  laws  has  many  in  industry  now  turning  to  the
Federal  Government  for  a  national  framework  that  will  harmonize  the  different
State laws.

Thirteen  states  have  e-waste  laws.  California  implemented  a  program  in  2005.
Maine,  Washington  and  Minnesota  implemented  e-waste  programs  in  2007,  and
other states with legislatively mandated programs will bring those programs online
in  the  near  future.  Many  electronics  producers  and  retailers  now  offer  some  type
of product take-back service. Despite this progress, the EPA estimates that at most
only 15 percent of products at the end of their useful lives reach a recycling or reuse
program. Cell phone producers, who have one of the most established take-back pro-
grams and whose product is easy for the consumer to return, only recapture a frac-
tion  of  the  phones  they  sell.  According  to  the  EPA,  about  two  million  tons  of  un-
wanted electronics end up in landfills or incinerators on average, while only 345,000
tons were ‘‘recycled.’’ 3 Many producers, recyclers, and experts site consumer behav-
ior  and  the  logistics  of  gathering  large  volumes  of  waste  as  a  major  hurdle  to  cost-
effective recycling.

Waste Management Issues

When  properly  handled,  used  electronic  products  can  be  a  valuable  source  for  re-
usable  equipment  or  secondary  feedstock.  However,  when  not  properly  handled,
studies  show  that  the  components  of  these  items  can  be  sources  of  toxins  and  car-
cinogens.  Cathode  ray  tubes  (CRTs),  the  glass  picture  tubes  found  in  some  tele-
visions  and  computer  monitors,  contain  approximately  five  to  eight  pounds  of  lead,
chromium,  nickel,  and  zinc.  Circuit  boards  also  contain  considerable  quantities  of
lead-tin  solders  and  are  likely  to  leach  into  groundwater  or  be  emitted  in  gaseous
form  if  destroyed  in  an  incinerator.  Up  to  thirty-eight  separate  chemical  elements
are incorporated into electronic waste items.

In  addition  to  concerns  about  pollution  and  volume  regarding  disposal  of  these
products  in  landfills,  electronic  equipment  also  contains  valuable  resources.  The
U.S.  Geological  Survey  estimates  that  scrap  electronics  contain  significantly  higher
concentrations of copper, gold, and other metals than an equivalent weight of a typ-
ical  ore.  The  recovery  of  the  metals  in  e-waste  decreases  the  need  for  virgin  mate-
rials  and  lessens  the  impact  on  the  environment  that  extraction  of  those  materials
represents.

It  is  also  important  to  consider  that  even  with  an  increased  content  of  recovered
materials,  the  production  of  electronic  products  carries  a  significant  environmental
footprint. Rapidly changing production methods and a scarcity of current data make

accurately  assessing  product  life  cycle  difficult.  Microchip  fabrication,  circuit  board
and component manufacturing, and the production of plastics, metals, glass, and the
specialized  chemicals  used  in  the  electronics  industry  have  high  energy  and  water
requirements  and  require  the  use  of  chemicals  that  are  harmful  to  human  health
and the environment. Many producers have made strides in increasing the efficiency
and  lessening  the  impact  of  manufacturing,  but  the  entire  life  cycle  of  electronics
still has a significant environmental footprint.

Obsolete  devices  from  industrialized  countries  can  find  their  way  to  developing
countries, where old computers and cell phones are often used for a few more years
or  processed  for  disposal.  High  disposal  costs  and  landfill  fees  in  the  developed
world  have  conspired  with  low  labor  costs  and  lenient  health  and  environmental
regulations  in  the  developing  world  to  create  an  incentive  to  export  used  electronic
products to nations like China and Nigeria. Some of these products are received for
legitimate  refurbishment  and  reuse,  but  an  overwhelming  quantity  has  no  reuse
value and is improperly and unsafely recycled or landfilled. Primitive recycling cre-
ates  health  hazards  for  the  laborers  and  environmental  problems  for  their  commu-
nities.  According  to  the  Basel  Action  Network  (BAN),  approximately  80  percent  of
the  e-waste  directed  to  recycling  in  the  U.S.  is  not  recycled,  and  instead  finds  its
way  overseas.  There  is  no  universally  accepted  standard  to  qualify  a  product  for
reuse.

Many  recyclers  are  environmentally  responsible  and  health  and  safety  conscious,
but  there  are  still  numerous  ‘‘sham’’  recycling  operations  that  engage  in  harmful
practices,  particularly  with  regards  to  export.  Stakeholders  are  working  with  the
EPA  to  create  a  set  of  best  practices  for  environmental  management  in  electronics
recycling, but there currently is no one universally accepted standard for electronics
recycling.  Electronics  ‘‘recycling’’  can  also  be  a  misleading  characterization  of  prac-
tices,  since  most  of  the  material  recovered  from  the  product,  in  particular  the  plas-
tics  and  the  glass,  is  not  reused  directly  in  the  electronics  industry,  and  much  is
fated for incineration (i.e., fuel for smelters and furnaces).

The U.S. is behind many other countries in confronting the e-waste challenge. The
European Union (EU) took action in 2000 by passing the Waste Electrical and Elec-
tronic Equipment Directive (WEEE), which bans the disposal of e-waste in landfills
and requires electronics producers to take back their used products. The WEEE Di-
rective  imposes  the  responsibility  for  the  disposal  of  e-waste  on  the  manufacturers.
Part of the impetus for this policy was the theory that giving the producers the re-
sponsibility  of  recycling  their  own  products  would  encourage  them  toward  greener
designs and products that are more easily recycled. It is too soon to assess whether
these  disposal  laws  have  motivated  producers  to  adopt  greener  designs.  However,
the EU Restriction of Hazardous Substance (RoHS) Directive banning the import of
electronics with toxics like lead and cadmium has motivated the use of greener ma-
terials in electronics sold around the world.

Recognizing the need to find better end-of-life management for these products, the
EPA and many producers, retailers, State and local governments have been working
to  improve  the  awareness  of  the  need  for  recovery  of  electronics  and  access  to  safe
reuse or recycling options. This is a national problem and there is a need for stand-
ards  and  safeguards  for  environmentally  sound  disposal  practices  that  strike  a  bal-
ance between manufacturer and consumer responsibility.

Chairman GORDON. This hearing will come to order. Good morn-
ing and welcome to today’s hearing entitled ‘‘Electronic Waste: Can
the Nation Manage Modern Refuse in the Digital Age?’’

I  would  like  to  welcome  our  panelists,  who  will  share  with  us
their  views  on  the  end-of-life  management  of  the  electronics  that
we all use and enjoy every day.

Let me also point out that it appears we are going to have a joint
session  later  on,  which  is  going  to  unfortunately  make  us  either
have to finish up before or come back after, so we hope—I want you
all to know that this is the start of this very important process and
we will deal with it when the time comes.

This nation started on the path that brings us here today in the
1940s  when  we  began  producing  and  buying  televisions.  By  the
1960s, about 60 million American homes had TV sets. By last year,
we  were  over  250  million.  In  the  1980s  we  began  to  acquire  home
computers and businesses, universities and schools invested in per-
sonal  computers.  Between  1986  and  1990,  around  28  million  per-
sonal  computers  were  sold  in  the  United  States  and  by  2000  that
number had more than doubled.

We  all  own  and  use  these  electronic  products—TVs,  computers,
cell  phones,  MP3  and  DVD  players,  but  we  rarely  stop  to  think
about what happens to all these products once we are finished with
them.

Today  the  amount  we  have  to  dispose  of  is  in  the  billions.  We
know  that  many  of  these  products  end  up  in  our  landfills  or  are
sitting  in  our  attics  and  storage  closets  because  we  aren’t  sure
what  to  do  with  them.  Innovation  in  the  electronics  industry  has
produced  staggering  advances  and  I  don’t  think  anybody  would
want  to  turn  back  the  clock  on  this  progress.  But  if  we  could  turn
the  clock  back  on  something  else,  we  would  want  to  ask  the  engi-
neers  who  began  using  lead  in  televisions  to  shield  viewers  from
the X-rays and ask, ‘‘How can we come up with something better?’’
Because  now  in  2008,  with  the  transition  to  digital  TV  signals
fast  approaching  and  better  technology  on  the  market,  we  have
millions  of  televisions  and  monitors  with  untold  tons  of  lead  head-
ing to the landfills. And these old products also contain toxins like
mercury and cadmium.

Fortunately, there is a growing awareness of recycling and going
green. As we will hear today, e-waste is not just trash. These prod-
ucts contain precious materials like gold and copper, and it doesn’t
make sense to put gold in a dump.

Over  a  dozen  states  now  have  legislation  mandating  proper  e-
waste  disposal  and  many  electronic  producers  now  offer  take-back
services.  However,  it  is  estimated  that  only  10  to  15  percent  of
these  products  reach  recyclers.  Clearly,  much  needs  to  be  done  to
educate  consumers  about  recycling  and  to  make  sure  everyone  has
access to recycling.

But  raising  awareness  is  not  the  only  thing  that  can  be  done  to
tackle  our  growing  pile  of  e-waste.  Today  we  will  also  hear  about
opportunities  to  design  products  to  avoid  end-of-life  problems  and
to  make  product  recycling  more  efficient  and  economically  attrac-
tive.  We  must  seriously  look  at  the  issue  of  reuse  and  help  find
ways to safeguard against its downstream problems.

We must also develop methods to adequately access the economic

and environmental impacts of e-waste and policies to manage it.

This  is  a  problem  of  global  proportions.  Technology  and  innova-
tion  have  as  much  a  role  to  play  in  solving  it  as  they  did  in  cre-
ating  it.  We  don’t  want  to  stifle  the  innovation  that  has  put  the
computing  power  of  a  room-sized  mainframe  into  the  palm  of  our
hand, but we want to go forward with enough information and fore-
sight to ensure that these modern marvels are not modern environ-
mental problems.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BART GORDON

Good  morning  and  welcome  to  today’s  hearing  on  electronic  equipment  waste  (e-

waste) in the United States.

I  would  like  to  welcome  our  panelists  who  will  share  with  us  their  views  on  the

end-of-life management of the electronics that we all use and enjoy everyday.

This  nation  started  on  the  path  that  brings  us  here  today  in  the  1940s  when  we
began producing and buying televisions. By 1960, about 60 million American homes
had TV sets. By last year, we were over 250 million.

In  the  1980’s  we  began  to  acquire  home  computers  and  businesses,  universities

and schools invested in personal computers.

Between  1986  and  1990,  around  28  million  personal  computers  were  sold  in  the

U.S. By 2000, that number had more than doubled.

We  all  own  and  use  these  electronic  products—TVs,  computers,  cell  phones,  MP3
and  DVD  players—but  we  rarely  stop  to  think  about  what  happens  to  all  these
products once we are finished with them.

Today  the  amount  we  have  to  dispose  of  is  in  the  billions.  We  know  that  many
of these products end up in our landfills or are sitting in our attics and storage clos-
ets because we aren’t exactly sure what to do with them.

Innovation  in  the  electronics  industry  has  produced  staggering  advances  and  I

don’t think anybody would want to turn the clock back on that progress.

But if we could turn the clock back on something, we would want to ask the engi-
neers  who  began  using  lead  in  televisions  to  shield  viewers  from  x-rays  and  ask,
‘‘Can we come up with something better here?’’

Because  now  in  2008,  with  the  transition  to  digital  TV  signals  fast  approaching
and  better  technology  on  the  market,  we  have  millions  of  TVs  and  monitors  with
untold  tons  of  lead,  headed  to  landfills.  And  these  old  products  also  contain  other
toxins like mercury and cadmium.

Fortunately, there is a growing awareness of recycling and going green. As we will

hear today, e-waste is not just trash.

sense to put gold in a dump.

These products contain precious metals like gold and copper, and it doesn’t make

pile of e-waste.

Over  a  dozen  states  now  have  legislation  mandating  proper  e-waste  disposal  and

many electronics producers now offer take-back services.

However,  it’s  estimated  that  only  about  10  to  15  percent  of  these  products  reach
recyclers. Clearly much needs to be done to educate consumers about recycling and
make sure everybody has access to recycling.

But raising awareness is not the only thing that can be done to tackle our growing

Today  we  will  also  hear  about  opportunities  to  design  products  to  avoid  end-of-
life problems and make product recycling more efficient and economically attractive.
We  must  seriously  look  at  the  issue  of  reuse  and  help  find  ways  to  safeguard

against its downstream problems.

We  must  also  develop  methods  to  adequately  assess  the  economic  and  environ-

mental impacts of e-waste and policies to manage it.

This is a problem of global proportions. Technology and innovation have as much

a role to play in solving it as they did in its creation.

We  don’t  want  to  stifle  the  innovation  that  has  put  the  computing  power  of  a
room-sized  mainframe  into  the  palm  of  our  hand,  but  we  want  to  go  forward  with
enough  information  and  foresight  to  ensure  that  these  modern  marvels  are  not  a
modern environmental problem.

Chairman  GORDON.  And  now  I  would  like  to  recognize  Mr.  Hall

for an opening statement.

Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you,  and  you  adequately  stated
it.  I  will  be  more  brief  than  you  were.  You  have  covered  the  sub-
ject.  You  wonder  where  a  lot  of  the  e-waste  is  going  to  wind  up.
You  know,  mine  winds  up  just  as  far  as  I  can  throw  it  every  now
and then, and my grandchildren get tired of me telling them I can
take  a  Big  Chief  tablet  and  cedar  pencil  and  figure  out  anything
you all can if you give me enough time.

It is an unusual panel, Mr. Chairman, and I really expect to get
some  good  information  from  them,  and  I  am  pleased  that  we  are
having  the  hearing.  E-waste  is  the  unintended  consequence  of  a
high-tech industry that has grown substantially since its beginning
in the second half of the 20th century, and although consumer elec-
tronics comprise less than two percent of the municipal solid waste,
it is really one of the fastest growing waste, I guess streams, if you
want  to  call  it  that,  in  the  United  States.  According  to  the  EPA,
less  than  20  percent  of  the  e-waste  is  now  recycled.  Advancement
in the consumer electronics field helped create this growing amount
of e-waste as electronics rapidly become obsolete.

There  are  a  lot  of  aspects  to  the  e-waste  dilemma:  the  definition
of  e-waste,  the  reuse  and  recycling  of  electronics,  landfill  disposal
and hazardous waste, regulatory issues and export economies. The
complexity  absolutely  creates  a  vast  array  of  opinions  on  possible
solutions to the problem. Today’s panel is well suited to help us ex-
plore  the  options  before  us  from  recycling  of  e-waste  to  better  de-
sign that will minimize the problem in the future.

The  House  has  passed  H.R.  2850,  which  is  the  Green  Chemistry
Research and Development Act of 2008, authored by my friend, Dr.
Gingrey.  I  think  this  legislation  was  a  step  in  the  right  direction,
and  like  I  said  on  the  House  Floor  at  the  time  of  its  passage,  ad-
vances  in  the  research  and  development  of  green  chemicals  and
products will reduce the creation of substances that are harmful to
our  environment.  This  certainly  applies  to  the  problems  with  e-
waste.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  the  panel  today.  I  yield  back  my

time, Mr. Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RALPH M. HALL

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  am  pleased  we  are  having  this  hearing  today.  Elec-
tronic waste, or e-waste, is the unintended consequence of a high-tech industry that

I look forward to hearing from the panel today about this important issue. I yield

back the balance of my time.

Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Hall.
If  there  are  Members  who  wish  to  submit  additional  opening
statements,  your  statements  will  be  added  to  the  record  at  this
point,  and  with  unanimous  consent,  Mr.  Hall,  I  will  ask  for  that
at  the  end  of  this  hearing  too  in  case  there  are  other  folks  that
would like to ask questions.

Thank  you.  I  am  glad  to  see  that  this  committee  is  addressing  the  issue  of  elec-

tronic waste.

on this issue.

Electronic  products  at  the  end  of  their  usability  must  either  be  thrown  away  or
recycled. Some electronics contain mercury, lead, cadmium or other toxic materials.
Today’s hearing will be valuable because we have a variety of witness perspectives

The Committee will hear testimony from witnesses offering perspectives from the
electronics manufacturing sector, the recycling industry, non-profit service provider,
and academic research and development.

This is actually an international issue. High disposal costs and landfill fees in the
developed world have conspired with low labor costs and lenient health and environ-
mental  regulations  in  the  developing  world  to  create  an  incentive  to  export  used
electronic products to nations like China and Nigeria.

Our  nation  needs  a  uniform  standard  for  recycling  and  appropriate  disposal  of

electronic waste.

It is wrong to leave an environment of mercury, lead and cadmium for our grand-

According  to  the  Basel  Action  Network  (BAN),  approximately  80  percent  of  the
e-waste  directed  to  recycling  in  the  U.S.  is  not  recycled,  and  instead  finds  its  way
overseas.

There is no universally accepted standard to qualify a product for reuse.
I see a role for the Federal Government to play.
I will be particularly interested to know of the electronics industry’s recommenda-
tions  of  how  to  develop  an  economical,  uniform  policy  that  is  not  harmful  for  our
environment.

Again, welcome to our witnesses. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the remainder of my

time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSS CARNAHAN

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  hosting  this  important  hearing  on  managing  elec-

tronic waste in the United States.

The  digital  era  provides  us  with  useful  technological  advances,  but  with  it  comes
the  alarming  result  that  our  nation  has  already  disposed  of  millions  of  electronic
products  and  will  continue  to  in  the  coming  years.  These  electronics  contain  lead,
mercury,  and  other  harmful  substances  that,  unless  properly  disposed  of,  can  con-
taminate  our  environment  and  present  health  dangers  to  our  citizens.  I  believe  it
is our responsibility to examine how we can best encourage the manufacture of elec-
tronic products while keeping the total cost of their life cycle, including the ultimate
disposal,  in  mind.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  more  from  our  witnesses  on  that  sub-
ject.

In  my  own  office,  last  year  we  transitioned  staff  to  TV  cards  on  our  computers,
enabling  us  to  watch  the  House  Floor  without  losing  desk  workspace.  We’ve  also
been fortunate enough to install teleconferencing between my district office and my
DC  office  via  a  flat  screen,  enabling  me  to  hold  meetings  with  constituents  when
I  must  be  in  Washington  voting  and  appearing  in  committee.  Our  office  is  a  prime
example  of  many,  many  other  businesses  and  households  across  the  Nation.  Our
new  technologies  help  me  to  do  my  job  better.  Yet,  multiple  television  sets  with
Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) reside in a storage area. The disposal of CRTs is a press-
ing issue, particularly with the upcoming digital conversion.

I  would  like  to  thank  today’s  witnesses,  Mr.  Castro,  Ms.  St.  Denis,  Mr.  Harris,
Mr.  Smith,  Mr.  Williams,  and  Dr.  Williams,  for  coming  before  the  Committee.  Mr.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE HARRY E. MITCHELL

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As  American  consumers  attempt  to  keep  up  with  the  latest  technology  trends  by
purchasing  the  newest  cell  phones  and  laptops,  the  number  of  discarded  electronic
products is rapidly increasing.

When electronic products are properly handled, these products can transform into

a valuable source for reusable equipment.

However,  if  these  products  are  not  disposed  of  properly,  they  are  potentially

harmful to both human health and the environment.

Currently,  there  are  no  federal  regulations  in  place  for  the  appropriate  disposal

of electronic waste (e-waste).

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  ERIC  D.  WILLIAMS,  ASSISTANT  PRO-
FESSOR,  DEPARTMENT  OF  CIVIL  AND  ENVIRONMENTAL  EN-
GINEERING  AND  SCHOOL  OF  SUSTAINABILITY,  ARIZONA
STATE UNIVERSITY
Mr. ERIC WILLIAMS. Chairman Gordon and other Members of the
Committee,  it  is  my  pleasure  to  be  here  today  to  testify.  Manage-
ment  of  end-of-life  of  electronics  is  a  new  challenge.  One  reason  is
the  rapid  evolution  of  technology.  While  new  electronic  products
like computers and cell phones have as long a potential lifespan as
traditional  white  goods,  in  practice  they  are  considered  obsolete
very  soon  and  replaced  with  new  models.  These  discards  are  our
e-waste.

A second distinction is that the environmental intensity of manu-
facturing  electronics  is  comparatively  high.  For  example,  it  takes
four  times  more  energy  to  make  a  desktop  computer  than  it  con-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:58 Aug 25, 2008 Jkt 041901 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL08\043008\41901 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

11

sumes  while  plugged  in  at  home.  In  contrast,  for  a  refrigerator,
most  of  the  energy  is  used  in  operation.  Manufacturing  is  a  small
share.  Surprisingly,  a  computer’s  annual  energy  costs  are  higher
than  for  a  refrigerator  if  one  includes  manufacturing.  Extending
electronics’  lifespans  thus  could  be  an  important  strategy  to  miti-
gate environmental impacts. This does not mean that we should try
to  make  do  with  slide  rules  or  pocket  calculators.  Rather,  robust
markets  for  used  electronics  can  help  ensure  that  functions  are
well matched with the needs and wants of users.

A third challenge is how to manage substances of concern in elec-
tronics such as lead and brominated flame retardants. Much of the
environmental  concern  concerning  e-waste  is  about  the  potential
for  lead  and  other  heavy  metals  to  leach  from  e-waste  in  landfills.
Circuit  boards  and  cathode  ray  tubes  are  classified  as  hazardous
waste  because  they  fail  EPA’s  TCLP  leaching  risk  test.  My  col-
leagues and I at Arizona State University recently reviewed the lit-
erature, and our conclusion was that the risk of leaching from sani-
tary  landfills  is  very  small,  if  not  negligible.  The  main  reasons  for
this  are,  one,  the  TCLP  test  is  considerably  more  aggressive  than
the  leaching  that  actually  occurs  in  landfills,  and  two,  modern
landfills have control systems to contain toxics that may leach out.
In contrast, there is as yet no evidence that modern recycling of cir-
cuit  boards  and  CRTs  is  environmentally  preferable  to  landfilling.
A  fourth  challenge  is  that  the  reuse  and  recycling  of  electronics
is often a net cost in the United States but in the developing world
is  a  profitable  business  because  the  developing  world  has  lower
labor  costs,  higher  demand  for  reused  products  and  parts,  and
lower  environmental  protection.  This  results  in  substantial  export
of  end-of-life  electronics  from  the  United  States  and  other  devel-
oped countries to developing countries.

The  electronics  reuse  and  recycling  industry  is  a  double-edged
sword  for  the  developing  world.  On  one  hand,  reuse  markets  pro-
vide  access  to  technology  which  people  could  otherwise  not  afford.
Low-cost  computers  and  cell  phones  in  particular  enhance  edu-
cation  and  economic  development.  The  recycling  and  refuse  indus-
try  employs  thousands  of  people.  On  the  other  hand,  the  recycling
of  electronics  is  often  done  in  developing  countries  via  an  informal
industry.  It  is,  in  my  opinion,  by  far  the  most  serious  environ-
mental  problem  associated  with  end-of-life  electronics.  Yet  there  is
as  yet  little  action  taken  to  improve  health  and  safety  conditions
in this industry.

I  believe  that  it  is  important  we  work  toward  electronic  product
solutions and policies which aim at triple bottom-line solutions: en-
vironmental,  economic,  and  social  benefits.  While  it  is  tempting  to
focus  only  on  environmental  issues,  some  environmental  options
have  negative  economic  and  social  impacts  for  disadvantaged
groups  leading  to  complex  ethical  choices.  We  need  to  understand
the tradeoffs between different options.

An  important  part  of  moving  forward  is  understanding  what  is
really  going  on  with  reuse  and  recycling.  One  reason  for  the  cur-
rent lack of information is that reuse and recycling activities do not
have their own industry or commodity codes and thus are invisible
to  conventional  statistics.  Considering  product  design,  using  and
developing  alternate  materials  is  an  important  strategy  but  it  is

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:58 Aug 25, 2008 Jkt 041901 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL08\043008\41901 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

12

important  to  note  that  even  a  computer  free  of  toxic  substances
would  still  be  dangerous  to  recycle  informally.  Many  of  the  toxics
are generated or used in the recycling processes themselves.

The design of information systems for products is much less dis-
cussed  but  I  think  one  of  the  major  untapped  opportunities  to  im-
prove  reuse  and  recycling.  One  idea  is  to  place  a  radio  frequency
identification device into a computer to act as a black box, periodi-
cally  recording  the  functionality  of  different  systems.  At  the  end-
of-life,  a  computer  arriving  at  a  processing  facility  could  be  re-
motely scanned to test functionality and classify it for reuse versus
recycling. There are many other possibilities.

To  sum  up,  I  am  concerned  that  current  policy  direction  around
the world may not take us in the direction we want to go. I believe
the  United  States  should  take  a  leadership  role.  Here  are  some
suggested directions: one, investigate the pros and cons of different
landfilling  and  recycling  technologies  to  establish  best  practices;
two,  promote  reuse  domestically  and  abroad;  three,  cooperate  with
the  developing  world  to  mitigate  the  impacts  of  informal  recycling;
and  four,  while  the  public  discourse  on  electronics  in  the  environ-
ment  focuses  on  end-of-life  issues,  information  technology  has
many  important  environmental  applications  which  we  should  not
neglect or ignore.

So  I  and  my  colleagues  at  Arizona  State  University  would  like

to thank you for your attention.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Williams follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF ERIC D. WILLIAMS

Chairman  Gordon  and  other  Members  of  the  Committee,  it  is  my  pleasure  to  be
here today to testify on the topic of end-of-life electronics. My name is Eric Williams
and  I  am  an  Assistant  Professor  at  Arizona  State  University  with  a  joint  appoint-
ment between the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the new
School of Sustainability.

The  fate  of  end-of-life  of  electronics,  also  known  as  e-waste,  has  gained  a  great
deal  of  attention  from  policy-makers  and  public  around  the  world.  The  chain  of  ac-
tivities  from  manufacturing  to  operation  to  disposal  is  highly  globalized  and  con-
tinues  to  globalize  further.  Policy  decisions  taken  here  in  the  U.S.,  in  Europe,  in
China  have  global  implications  for  the  industries  involved  in  electronics  manufac-
turing  and  end-of-life.  Here  in  the  U.S.  some  states  such  as  California  and  Maine
have already developed and implemented State-level legislation mandating recycling
of  end-of-life  electronics.  Given  the  importance  of  the  electronics  industry  both  in
the U.S. and globally, I believe it important that the U.S. Government takes a lead-
ership role in developing responsible policies and practices for managing e-waste. In
my  testimony  I  intend  to  lay  out  one  view  of  how  this  nation  might  work  towards
sustainable management of end-of-life electronics.
End-of-life electronics: a unique challenge

First  I  will  discuss  how  management  of  end-of-life  electronics  is  a  unique  new
challenge  compared  to  previous  products.  One  reason  is  the  rapid  evolution  of  elec-
tronics technology. Rapid progress goes hand-in-hand with rapid obsolescence, which
has two main implications for environmental management. One is that it stimulates
purchases  of  new  devices  as  consumers  aim  to  take  advantage  of  improved  tech-
nology.  A  second  is  that  the  characteristics  of  the  waste  stream  evolve  along  with
the product.

A second reason is that the environmental intensity of manufacturing electronics,
in  particular  information  technology  goods,  is  higher  than  many  other  consumer
products. For example, it takes four times more energy to make a desktop computer
than it consumes while plugged in at home. For a refrigerator, in contrast, most en-
ergy  is  used  in  operation,  the  energy  used  in  manufacturing  is  a  small  share.  This
high  energy  intensity  in  manufacturing  combined  with  rapid  product  turnover  im-
plies a surprisingly high net impact: when the energy used in manufacturing is am-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:58 Aug 25, 2008 Jkt 041901 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\043008\41901 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

13

ortized over the life of the product, annual energy costs for owning a personal com-
puter are higher than for a refrigerator.

How  does  this  high  environmental  intensity  of  manufacturing  tie  in  with  the  e-
waste  issue?  Reduce,  reuse,  recycle,  or  the  3Rs,  is  a  mantra  of  waste  management.
However, most of the environmental investment in high-technology electronics is in
not in the materials but is in its complex manufactured form. Recycling is less effec-
tive  at  recovering  this  investment  than  for  many  other  goods  (e.g.,  an  aluminum
can).  While  appropriate  end-of-life  management  is  needed,  the  high  environmental
investment  in  form  versus  materials  in  electronics  tilts  the  3Rs  such  that  Reduce
and Reuse tend to be much more effective than recycling at reducing life cycle envi-
ronmental impacts. Extending lifespan is thus an important strategy to mitigate en-
vironmental  impacts.  Extending  lifespan  does  not  mean  that  we  should  make  do
with slide rules or pocket calculators! Rather, we should work to match the perform-
ance specs of hardware with actual needs of users, for example with reuse markets.
A third reason e-waste management poses a unique challenge is the mix of mate-
rials used in making electronics. Electronics contain valuable materials for recycling
such as copper, silver and gold as well as known toxic substances such as lead, cad-
mium  and  mercury.  There  are  also  new  substances  of  concern:  for  instance,
brominated  flame  retardants  are  added  to  circuit  boards  and  cases  to  reduce  flam-
mability. Recent scientific studies show that some brominated flame retardants are
endocrine disruptors and that their concentrations in human tissues are rapidly in-
creasing.  While  the  human  health  and  environment  effects  of  brominated  flame
retardants  are  uncertain,  I  believe  there  is  enough  evidence  to  justify  concern  and
response.

Much of the environmental discourse surrounding e-waste centers around the con-
cern  that  lead  and  other  heavy  metals  could  leach  from  e-waste  put  into  landfills
and  contaminate  ground  water.  Circuit  boards  and  Cathode  Ray  Tubes  (CRTs)  fail
the  EPA’s  Toxicity  Characteristic  Leaching  Procedure  (TCLP)  test,  resulting  in
these  items  being  classified  as  hazardous  waste.  The  TCLP  test  involves  grinding
up  the  material  in  question,  putting  it  into  an  acidic  solution  and  measuring  the
amount  of  material  (such  as  lead)  that  seeps  out.  My  colleagues  and  I  at  Arizona
State University recently reviewed the literature relevant to the actual risk of heavy
metals  leaching  from  e-waste  in  sanitary  landfills  in  the  U.S.  Our  conclusion  was
that  the  risk  of  environmental  harm  from  landfilled  e-waste  is  negligible,  despite
the  failure  of  the  TLCP  test  by  some  electronic  components.  The  main  reasons  for
this are: 1. that the TCLP tests are considerably more aggressive than the leaching
that  actually  occurs  in  municipal  (non-hazardous)  waste  landfills  and  2.  modern
landfills have control systems to contain any toxics which may leach out.

Is  modern  recycling  of  circuit  boards  and  CRTs  actually  environmentally  pref-
erable to putting these parts in sanitary landfills? We argue that this is not known
and  that  it  is  conceivable  that  recycling  could  emit  more  toxic  heavy  metals  over
the life cycle. Recycling by definition mobilizes materials (e.g., via smelting), and de-
pending on the level of process control can emit lead, mercury, and other hazardous
substances. In contrast with landfills however, recycling has the virtue of replacing
production  of  virgin  materials  with  recycled  substitutes.  If  the  avoided  lead  emis-
sions  associated  with  mining  and  milling  are  larger  than  for  recycling,  recycling
would  reduce  total  lead  emissions.  If  not,  recycling  e-waste  has  the  potential  to  re-
lease  more  lead  to  the  environment  than  e-waste  in  landfills.  Currently  there  are
no analyses addressing under what circumstances which option (recycle versus land-
fill)  leads  to  lower  life  cycle  emissions  of  heavy  metals.  I  suggest  that  this  issue  be
resolved  before  public  policy  mandates  recycling  as  the  default  environmentally
preferable alternative.

A fourth reason e-waste management presents a challenge is that while reuse and
recycling  of  electronics  in  the  developing  world  runs  a  net  profit  in  the  U.S.  recy-
cling often results in a net cost. The main factors contributing to this dichotomy are
lower  labor  costs,  higher  demand  for  reused  products  and  parts,  and  less  stringent
environmental  protections  in  the  developing  world.  Recycling  in  the  developing
world at a net profit versus recycling in the U.S. at a net cost creates a market dy-
namic  for  exporting  electronics  to  the  developing  world.  The  electronics  reuse/recy-
cling industry is a double-edged sword for the developing world. On one hand reuse
markets  provides  access  to  technology  to  people  who  otherwise  could  not  afford  it
and  creates  jobs  for  thousands  of  people.  Many  of  the  electronics  goods  people  own
in developing countries were first used in the U.S. The availability of low cost recy-
cled computers and cell phones, in particular, can play an important role in increas-
ing the use of Information Technology (IT) to enhance economic and educational ac-
tivities in developing countries.

On the other hand, recycling of electronics in developing countries is often imple-
mented  by  an  informal  industry.  U.S.  NGOs  such  as  the  Basel  Action  Network

(BAN) and the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition have reported that informal recycling
activities in China, India and Nigeria cause serious environmental harm. For exam-
ple,  in  many  cases  wires  are  pulled  from  computers,  collected  and  burned  in  open
piles  to  remove  casings  and  recover  re-saleable  copper.  This  results  in  creation  and
emission  of  dioxins,  furan  and  other  environmental  pollutants.  Circuit  boards  are
treated  to  extract  copper  and  precious  metals  using  acid,  cyanide  and/or  and  mer-
cury  often  in  a  manners  that  leads  to  uncontrolled  discharge  of  contaminated  proc-
ess liquid, sometimes next to rivers. Scientific evidence is mounting which confirms
that  the  environmental  impacts  of  these  activities  are  indeed  severe.  In  Guiyu,  a
town  in  China  well  known  for  informal  electronics  recycling,  emissions  of  dioxins
were shown to be thousands of times the U.S. standard and blood lead concentration
in  children  were  found  to  exceed  levels  of  concern.  It  is  my  opinion  that  informal
recycling  represents  by  far  the  most  serious  environmental  issue  for  end-of-elec-
tronics.  Yet  there  is  as  yet  little  action  being  taken  to  improve  health  and  safety
conditions in the industry. I believe that the U.S. should work with developing coun-
tries to address informal recycling.
Policy and e-waste

End-of-life electronics management interfaces with environmental, social and eco-
nomic  issues.  What  are  nations  and  regions  around  the  world  doing  legislatively  to
address this management challenge? There are three primary approaches. The first
legislative  approach  is  enacting  take-back  systems  which  collect  end-of-life  elec-
tronics  for  recycling.  Such  systems  have  been  mandated  in  the  European  Union,
Japan  and  other  nations,  and  a  few  U.S.  states  such  as  California  and  Maine.  The
ostensible  goals  of  this  legislation  are  to  keep  e-waste  out  of  landfills  and  increase
recycling of materials. However, the net environmental benefit of this legislation is,
I  believe,  as  yet  unclear.  Recycling  may  not  be  environmentally  preferable  to
landfilling and in addition take-back systems could have an adverse affect on reuse
of  equipment.  I  do  not  believe  the  landfill  versus  recycle  question  has  been  suffi-
ciently resolved to warrant a blanket priority for policy.

The  second  approach  to  legislation  regulates  the  use  of  materials  in  electronics.
The  primary  example  of  this  type  of  policy  is  the  Restriction  on  Hazardous  Sub-
stances  (RoHS)  legislation  promulgated  in  the  European  Union.  RoHS  restricts  six
hazardous  elements  in  different  applications;  lead,  mercury,  cadmium,  hexavalent
chromium,  and  the  polybrominated  biphenyls  (PBB)  and  polybrominated  diphenyl
ethers (PBDE) flame retardants. Any electronics manufacturer wishing to sell their
products  in  Europe  must  abide  by  the  rules,  thus  this  regional  legislation  effects
global change in the industry. Exposure to brominated flame retardants presumably
occurs  while  the  goods  are  in  service,  thus  removing  them  has  a  high  potential  to
reduce  consumer  risk.  However,  banning  the  use  of  lead  in  solder  has  been  a  par-
ticular  source  of  controversy  with  respect  to  RoHS,  with  many  in  the  U.S.  arguing
that the environmental need for the ban is unclear. For heavy metals like lead, ex-
posure generally is not an issue during use of the product but depends on handling
at end-of-life. Furthermore, while lead exposure in informal recycling is a clear risk
to  workers  and  local  communities,  the  overall  risk  to  workers  from  lead  exposure
is  reduced  but  not  clearly  managed  by  banning  lead  solder,  since  lead  is  only  re-
moved from solder but not from CRTs, which contain far more lead than solder.

A  third  approach  to  legislation  regulates  trade  in  end-of-life  electronics.  This  is
usually  applied  at  the  national  level,  for  instance  China  bans  imports  of  used  elec-
tronics and e-waste. However, while officially a ban is in place in China, the imports
of  e-waste  coming  in  China  have  continued  unofficially  more  or  less  as  before.  At
the  international  level,  the  central  framework  for  controlling  international  move-
ments  of  hazardous  substances  is  the  Basel  Convention.  The  Basel  Convention  re-
quires  prior  notification  between  signatories  when  trading  wastes  classified  as  haz-
ardous.  Many  categories  of  e-waste  are  classified  as  hazardous  waste  and  thus  are
targeted  for  prior  notification.  Products  intended  for  reuse,  however,  are  exempt
from  control.  Furthermore,  the  Convention  does  not  suggest  how  to  establish  the
reusability of a given trade flow in practice, a nontrivial challenge.

Do these current policy directions achieve desirable environmental, social and eco-
nomic objectives for society? On the environmental side, many in the scientific com-
munity are of the opinion that the risk associated with landfilling e-waste has been
vastly  overstated.  The  most  pressing  environmental  issue  is,  in  all  likelihood,  the
adverse impact of informal recycling in developing countries. Dealing with these and
other  issues  can  lead  to  complex  ethical  choices.  Policies  can  result  in  tradeoffs  be-
tween  environmental,  economic  and  social  issues.  For  example  a  ban  on  exports  of
end-of-life  electronics  might  seem  an  appropriate  course  of  action  to  mitigate  envi-
ronmental impacts of informal recycling. However, a blanket trade ban would make
used  IT  equipment  less  available  abroad.  Also,  it  would  cut  off  the  supply  of  raw

material to a reuse/recycling industry providing thousands of jobs to poor people. Is
this  appropriate,  especially  given  an  absence  of  prior  attempts  to  redress  occupa-
tional and safety issues of the industry?

While it may seem off-topic, I think it important to raise the issue of the environ-
mental applications of IT. Informational Technology can be used to reduce a variety
of different environmental impacts. For instance, it can reduce the impacts of trans-
portation systems by enabling telecommuting, virtual meetings, and creating virtual
networks  of  car-poolers.  Furthermore,  a  great  deal  of  energy  consumption  in  resi-
dential and commercial buildings goes towards energy services not actually needed,
such  as  heating  or  cooling  unoccupied  rooms.  Substantial  energy  can  be  saved  via
computerized  monitoring  and  control  systems.  The  environmental  management  of
electronics  has  come  to  be  conceptualized  in  terms  of  its  potential  end-of-life  im-
pacts. While end-of-life impacts should certainly be better managed, we should allo-
cate  our  attention  and  resources  in  proportion  to  potential  benefits.  The  environ-
mental potential of IT is significant yet relatively ignored.
Towards the future: Product, reuse/recycling processes and policy design

It is important to work creatively towards the design of products, reuse and recy-
cling  processes,  and  policies  to  achieve  multiple  societal  objectives.  An  important
starting point to achieve this goal is characterizing domestic and international flows
of end-of-life electronics. Currently flows of e-waste products and materials are poor-
ly understood. One reason for this is that reuse and recycling activities do not have
their own industry or commodity codes and are thus invisible to conventional trade
statistics systems. Under a grant from the National Science Foundation in the Envi-
ronmental Sustainability program, my colleagues and I at Arizona State University
are working to characterize international e-waste flows and come up with new solu-
tions  to  capture  this  information.  This  is  at  present  the  only  U.S.  project  of  its  ilk
I  know  of.  Japan  in  comparison  is  investing  far  more  in  order  to  characterize  and
plan  management  of  international  end-of-life  flows  for  a  variety  of  consumer  prod-
ucts and recycled materials.

Product  design  can  be  viewed  through  three  different  lenses:  materials,  assem-
blies,  and  informatics.  Material  selection  is  one  important  strategy  for  optimizing
end-of-use  value.  The  RoHS  legislation  for  example  takes  the  step  of  banning  two
brominated  flame  retardants.  The  potential  snag  is  that  it  is  not  yet  clear  whether
environmentally acceptable alternatives are available. Research and development in
green  chemistry  is  needed  to  develop  and  test  alternatives.  We  should  however  be
cognizant  that  material  selection  faces  limits.  Even  a  computer  completely  free  of
toxic  substances  would  still  be  dangerous  to  recycle  informally  because  of  the  toxic
substances generated and used in recycling. I believe the target should be managing
the exposure to toxics by developing environmentally sound recycling processes rath-
er than the complete elimination of all substances of concern.

Assemblies  refer  to  how  parts  are  put  together,  which  also  has  effects  on  end-of-
life processing. Disassembly is currently carried out by hand and labor costs are an
important  cost  issue.  Snap-fits  for  easier  disassembly  and  making  parts  of  concern
such  as  nickel  cadmium  batteries  easily  accessible  reduces  labor  costs  of  recycling
and potentially reduces adverse impacts of informal recycling.

The  design  of  informatics  as  it  relates  to  the  end-of-life  of  products  is  much  less
discussed  than  material  and  assembly  choice.  Information  Technology  can  be  ap-
plied  to  construct  information  systems  to  enhance  the  reusability  and  recyclability
of  products.  For  example,  Radio  Frequency  Identification  Devices  (RFIDs)  could  be
placed  in  computers  to  provide  information  wirelessly  to  reuse/recycling  systems.
One concept is an RFID ‘‘blackbox’’ for each computer, which periodically records the
functionality  of  different  subsystems.  At  the  end-of-life,  a  computer  arriving  at  a
processing  center  can  be  wirelessly  scanned  for  functionality  and  selected  for  reuse
versus recycling.

Another  layer  of  informatics  design  relates  to  the  ease  and  security  with  which
consumers  can  resell  their  computers.  After  purchasing  a  replacement  computer,
consumers  often  store  their  old  computer,  unused  for  years,  until  some  decision  is
made  regarding  its  end-of-life  disposition.  One  reason  for  this  is  concern  whether
data on the old computer has been backed up and if it can be securely erased before
selling.  There  are  software  applications  which  could  be  packaged  with  computers
which  create  backups  and  then  thoroughly  erase  all  data.  Another  obstacle  to  used
markets  relates  to  the  transfer  of  the  right  to  use  pre-installed  software  from  first
user to secondary user. In general software license agreements grant the secondary
user the same rights to use software but in practice the current rights labeling sys-
tem  does  not  enable  the  secondary  user  to  clearly  establish  this  right  from  a  legal
perspective.  To  protect  themselves  from  litigation  from  software  companies,  reuse
and  refurbishing  companies  routinely  wipe  hard  drives  of  the  used  computers  they

16

purchase.  This  loss  of  software  reduces  the  value  of  the  used  computer.  This  could
be  avoided  if  pre-installed  software  rights  were  packaged  with  the  computer  in  a
verifiable way.

Considering  end-of-life  processes,  one  important  task  is  to  assess  the  environ-
mental  characteristics  of  recycling,  especially  those  processes  such  as  smelters  and
acid  leaching  which  mobilize  toxics.  There  are  a  variety  of  recycling  processes  and
practices  currently  in  use  around  the  world.  Assessment  will  reveal  which  are  best
practices and in what specific areas it may be most appropriate to invest in research
and development of environmentally benign recycling processes.

Another  layer  of  design  is  policy.  It  is  fair  to  characterize  the  current  status  of
policy  development  as  one  in  which  nations  and  states  are  experimenting  with  dif-
ferent  policy  designs  to  manage  end-of-life  electronics.  There  is  still  much  room  to
develop policy alternatives. One alternative policy direction is to design systems in-
tended  to  ensure  environmentally  safe  end-of-life  management  while  at  the  same
time  establishing  a  competitive  market  for  reuse  and  recycling  services.  One  con-
crete  idea  to  realize  this  goal  is  termed  e-Market  for  Returned  Deposit.  The  e-Mar-
ket  system  begins  with  a  deposit  paid  by  consumers  to  sellers  at  the  time  of  pur-
chase, electronically registered and tracked via a Radio-Frequency Identification De-
vice (RFID) placed on the product. At end-of-life, consumers consult an Internet-en-
abled  market  in  which  firms  compete  to  receive  the  deposit  by  offering  consumers
variable  degrees  of  return  on  the  deposit.  After  collection  of  the  computer  by  the
selected  firm,  the  cyber-infrastructure  utilizes  the  RFID  to  transfer  the  deposit  to
the  winning  firm  when  recycled.  If  the  firm  chooses  to  refurbish  or  resell  the  com-
puter  in  lieu  of  recycling,  the  transfer  is  deferred  until  true  end-of-life  processing.
A second policy proposal focuses on redressing the environmental impacts of infor-
mal  recycling  abroad.  The  basic  idea  is  to  pay  workers  involved  in  reuse  and  dis-
assembly  not  to  recycle  those  components  dangerous  to  handle  with  informal  proc-
essing.  This  could  be  implemented  via  a  system  which  establishes  collection  points
at  which  workers  would  be  paid  fixed  prices  to  deliver  targeted  parts.  The  price  is
set to create a financial incentive for informal recyclers to deliver the targeted parts
rather than process them on their own. Under this system the collected parts would
be  transported  and  processed  in  appropriate  recycling  facilities.  Since  much  of  the
cost associated with recycling is with transport and disassembly, this system would
presumably  be  an  inexpensive  option  to  avoid  informal  recycling  while  maintaining
an active reuse industry.
Conclusion

Are there product, process and policy designs which allow us to mitigate environ-
mental  impacts  while  at  the  same  time  realizing  the  social  and  economic  benefits
of  recycling  and  reuse  of  electronics?  Management  efforts  up  to  now  have  focused
on heuristic goals such as increasing recycling rates and banning e-waste from land-
fills. It is not clear to me that this approach will take us where we want to go. We
need  to  think  about  desired  endpoints  such  as  safety  from  exposure  to  toxics,  net
reduced  energy  use,  availability  of  affordable  IT  to  everyone,  and  creating  jobs  and
capital.  We  should  work  backwards  from  these  endpoints  to  find  the  policies,  proc-
esses, and product designs which deliver the desired outcomes. In addition, we also
need  to  work  much  harder  on  using  IT  as  a  tool  to  achieve  environmental  goals.
Here are some suggested starting points:

• Investigate the life cycle environmental pros and cons of landfilling and recy-
cling end-of-life electronics in order to benchmark best practices. This evalua-
tion  should  allow  reconsideration  of  whether  the  current  TCLP  based  stand-
ard regulating the landfilling e-waste is appropriate.

• Undertake  research  to  develop  new  materials  as  appropriate,  such  as  bro-
mine-free  flame  retardants.  New  materials  need  to  be  thoroughly  evaluated
before they are adopted.

• Encourage  reuse  of  electronics  through  improved  informatics  design,  such  as
bundling  of  backup/erase  applications  with  new  computers.  These  improve-
ments make it easier for users to resell their computer securely and with soft-
ware intact.

• Work  to  ensure  that  used  electronics  we  export  to  developing  countries  is  in
good working order. Strategies to achieve this include use of RFID blackboxes
to enable remote checking of recent functionality and certification schemes for
used equipment.

• Work  with  developing  countries  to  improve  occupational,  health  and  safety

conditions in informal recycling industries.

I  believe  the  U.S.  Federal  Government  should  take  a  leadership  role  in  working
towards  a  sustainable  management  of  electronics.  The  electronics  industry  is  not  a
domestic  affair,  and  policies  outside  the  U.S.  federal  context  affect  the  global  sys-
tem. If the Federal Government does not take action, other nations will, setting the
playing  field  without  U.S.  input.  I  hope  we  can  proceed  through  a  combination  of
thinking  creatively,  assessing  carefully,  and  acting  decisively  to  create  sound  poli-
cies  and  practices  for  end-of-life  management  of  electronics.  I  and  my  colleagues  at
Arizona State University would like to thank you for your attention.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  GERARDO  N.  CASTRO,  DIRECTOR  OF  EN-
VIRONMENTAL  SERVICES  AND  CONTRACTS,  GOODWILL  IN-
DUSTRIES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
Mr.  CASTRO.  Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee,  my
name  is  Gerardo  Castro  and  I  am  the  Director  of  Environmental
Services  and  Contracts  for  Goodwill  Industries  of  Southern  Cali-
fornia.  I  am  pleased  to  testify  before  the  Committee  today  on  how
we can best manage electronic waste.

Goodwill  Industries  International  is  a  network  of  184  local  au-
tonomous Goodwill agencies in the United States and 16 countries.
We  fund  our  mission  through  revenues  collected  from  donated
goods  as  well  as  through  industrial  and  workforce  development
contracts  with  government  and  the  private  sector.  In  2007,  my
agency  served  more  than  31,000  people  with  disabilities  or  voca-
tional disadvantages through education, job training and placement
programs.  We  operate  54  retail  stores,  40  attended  donation  cen-
ters, three campuses, and 21 workforce training centers.

During the past decade, we have seen a growing number of com-
puters  and  other  electronic  devices  dropped  off  at  our  stores  and
donation centers. Nearly all of our agencies received discarded elec-
tronics.  In  2004,  local  Goodwill  agencies  handled  nearly  23  million
pounds  of  electronics.  With  the  transition  to  digital  televisions,
California  expects  15  million  television  sets  to  be  discarded  next
year.  The  problem  of  e-waste  is  a  growing  one  but  it  also  rep-
resents a great opportunity.

My  views  today  represent  those  of  my  agency,  Goodwill  Indus-
tries  of  Southern  California.  In  2003,  California  became  the  first
state  in  the  Nation  to  enact  legislation  which  implemented  strict
standards  for  the  disposal  of  e-waste,  the  California  Electronic
Waste Recycling Act, or S.B. 20 or S.B. 50. The program was later
implemented in 2005. In 2007, my agency was able to divert a total
of  4.6  million  pounds  of  electronic  waste  out  of  county  landfills.
These  products  ranged  from  computers  and  monitors  to  printers
and other peripherals.

California is the only state which uses the advanced recovery fee
model  to  pay  for  the  costs  associated  with  collecting,  de-manufac-
turing  and  recycling  covered  electronic  products.  Retailers  are  re-
quired  to  collect  a  fee  of  $6  to  $10,  depending  on  the  size  of  the
screen,  on  any  cathode  ray  tube,  liquid  crystal  display,  or  plasma
device  sold  in  California.  These  fees  go  into  a  State  recycling  fund
to reimburse authorized collectors and authorized recyclers. Collec-
tors  receive  20  cents  per  pound  for  picking  up  unusable  CRTs  and
delivering  them  to  recyclers,  who  get  28  cents  for  canceling  them.
Along  with  nine  other  California  Goodwills,  we  are  a  State-au-
thorized  e-waste  collector.  As  an  authorized  e-waste  collector,  we
process over 10,000 CRT units per month. We follow specific proce-
dures  in  recycling  e-waste.  First,  we  recycle  working  computers  by
wiping the hard drives to Department of Defense standards, install
new hard drives and sell the refurbished units in our stores. These
sales  generate  approximately  10  percent  of  our  total  e-recycling
revenue.  Another  70  percent  comes  from  the  dismantling  and  sale
of  plastic  and  metal  circuit  boards  and  other  components  to  com-
modity dealers. The final 20 percent is obtained by taking unusable
CRTs to State-authorized recyclers.

Through our national network of 2,100 stores and 4,100 attended
donation  centers  in  virtually  every  community  in  America,  Good-
will  already  has  the  capacity  and  infrastructure  to  provide  for  na-
tionwide collecting of e-waste products.

The  Federal  Government  can  encourage  private-sector  invest-
ment and not-for-profit involvement in the used electronic recycling
reuse market through tax credits for consumers and manufacturers
who partner with social agencies, recycling grants and other initia-
tives that help stakeholders solve this growing challenge.

Goodwill  Industries  looks  forward  to  working  with  the  House
Science  Committee  to  support  a  national  solution  to  handle  e-
waste.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF GERARDO N. CASTRO

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  my  name  is  Gerardo  Castro  and
I  am  the  Director  of  Environmental  Services  and  Contracts  for  Goodwill  Industries
of  Southern  California.  I  am  pleased  to  testify  before  the  Committee  today  on  how
we can best manage electronic waste.

We  have  184  local,  autonomous  Goodwill  agencies  in  the  U.S.  and  16  countries,
and  we  fund  our  mission  through  revenues  collected  from  donated  goods,  govern-
ment  contracts,  and  workforce  development  funding.  Goodwill  Industries  of  South-
ern  California  serves  more  than  31,000  people  per  year  with  disabilities  or  voca-
tional  disadvantages  through  education,  job  training,  and  placement  programs.  We
also  operate  54  retail  stores,  40  attended  donation  centers,  three  campuses  and  21
workforce/training  centers  in  San  Bernardino,  Riverside,  and  Los  Angeles  counties.
In  a  survey  conducted  in  2005,  we  found  that  nearly  all  of  our  members  receive
electronics through their donation streams and our members handled nearly 23 mil-
lion pounds of electronics in 2004.

During  the  past  decade,  however,  we  have  seen  a  growing  number  of  computers
and other electronic devices donated to Goodwill agencies, and many of these items
are just dropped off at our stores or donation centers. The problem is a growing one
for  us,  but  it  also  presents  opportunities.  With  the  transition  to  digital  television,
we expect to see an influx of television sets as well.

In  a  poll  conducted  by  Goodwill  Industries  International,  Inc.,  we  found  that  91
percent of our local agencies accept donated televisions, and local Goodwill agencies
receive  on  average  118  televisions  per  month  or  1,400  per  year.  The  total  for  all
Goodwill  agencies  is  more  than  163,000  per  year.  Fifty  percent  of  our  agencies  re-
sell the televisions in stores and 30 percent recycle the sets.

My  views  today  represent  those  of  my  agency—Goodwill  Industries  of  Southern
California.  Because  of  the  environmental  concerns  specific  to  computers  and  other
electronic devices, many of our local agencies are exploring various business-to-busi-
ness  solutions  in  the  effective  disposal  of  electronic  waste  and  ways  to  recycle  the
waste. Other agencies are exploring methods of handling e-waste and still others are
working to understand and comply with new State laws on recycling e-waste.

My  particular  agency  received  a  total  of  4.6  million  pounds  of  e-waste  products
ranging  from  computers,  monitors,  printers,  and  other  peripherals.  A  substantial
number of these items are unusable and the cost of safely and responsibly recycling
or  disposing  of  these  products  can  directly  impact  the  job  training  and  career  serv-
ices offered by our agencies.

More  and  more  states  have  passed  landfill  bans,  and  for  those  Goodwill  agencies
that  do  dispose  of  electronic  waste  in  landfills  the  fees  to  do  so  can  be  exorbitant.
In  addition,  some  agencies  are  working  within  various  State  laws  on  the  effective
disposal and recycling of e-waste.

In 2003, California became the first state to enact a law that implements stricter
standards on e-waste disposal; SB20/SB50, the California Electronic Waste Recycling
Act,  provides  reimbursement  to  authorized  collectors  and  recyclers  from  a  State  e-
waste  fund.  Today,  10  states  have  passed  laws  that  create  statewide  e-waste  recy-
cling  programs.  Others  have  passed  laws  that  prohibit  e-waste  from  being  disposed
of  in  landfills  or  incinerated.  In  2008,  18  states  are  considering  e-waste  legislation.
California  is  the  only  state  that  uses  the  Advanced  Recovery  Fee  (ARF)  model  to
pay  for  the  costs  associated  with  collecting,  de-manufacturing,  and  recycling  of  cov-
ered  electronic  products,  which  is  similar  to  the  recycling  payment  system  for  bev-
erage containers or used tires. Retailers are required to collect a $6–$10 fee on cath-
ode  ray  tube  (CRT),  liquid  crystal  display  (LCD),  and  plasma  devices.  The  fees  col-
lected go into a fund to manage the recycling program.

Goodwill  Industries  of  Southern  California,  along  with  nine  other  Goodwills  lo-
cated in the state, is a State-authorized e-waste collector. There are 600 authorized
collectors in the state. The fund receives revenues from the point of sale fee on items
with  a  screen  purchased  in  California.  The  State  of  California  has  just  completed
its third year of the program. The program has been very successful when measured
by the pounds of CRTs diverted from landfills. The program has built in review and
adjustment points to maintain a self-funding level. The program is revenue neutral
to  the  State  of  California  as  it  involves  zero  tax  dollars.  It  is  authorized  to  adjust
at least every two years on both the ARF and the fees paid to authorized collectors
and  authorized  recyclers.  We  are  expecting  the  state  to  increase  the  ARFs  and  re-
duce the fees to collectors by about three cents a pound.

As  an  authorized  e-waste  recycler,  we  process  over  10,000  CRT  units  per  month
and pick up large corporate donations; in addition, individual donations are accepted
at  our  donation  centers.  We  accept  computers,  monitors,  TV  sets,  digital  cameras,
printers,  modems,  and  other  electronic  equipment.  We  collect  CRTs  and  ship  non-

working ones directly to a cancellation facility that will break them down into their
basic commodity. All other obsolete or non-working electronics are de-manufactured
by  our  workforce  who  are  people  with  disabilities.  We  then  sell  the  plastic,  metal,
circuit boards, and other components for their salvage value.

We  follow  a  system  and  certain  procedures  in  recycling  e-waste.  First,  we  recycle
old  computers  by  wiping  the  hard  drives  to  the  Department  of  Defense  standard.
We  then  refurbish  and  resell  about  10  percent,  and  then  dismantle  and  sell  the
plastic and metal parts for salvage; this amounts to about 70 percent. About 20 per-
cent is sent to other authorized recyclers.

Other  local  Goodwill  agencies  are  developing  innovative  business  solutions  to  ad-
dress the growing surplus of computer donations. I want to note that our local Good-
will  agencies  have  the  capacity  and  the  infrastructure  to  provide  nationwide  collec-
tion,  since  we  already  have  locations  throughout  the  country  in  both  urban  and
rural  areas.  Some  agencies  are  refurbishing  and  de-manufacturing  the  equipment;
reselling  systems  and  components;  expanding  client  training  and  career  services;
and avoiding high disposal costs.

Local Goodwill agencies handle e-waste in different ways depending on their size,
community,  and  external  partners.  For  example,  some  are  involved  with  producer
take  back  programs,  while  our  agency,  because  we  have  SB  20/SB  50,  is  not.  An
internal  Goodwill  Industries  International,  Inc.  taskforce  identified  four  innovative
e-recycling  models  that  have  so  far  been  successful  in  meeting  Goodwill  Industries’
revenue  goals,  concern  for  the  environment,  and  most  importantly,  our  charitable
mission.

Specifically, the various models are as follows:

(1) Retail—a  model  focusing  on  the  collecting,  de-manufacturing,  refurbishing
and reselling computer systems and components in a dedicated retail store.
(2) Client—a  model  integrating  client  technology  training  and  workforce  devel-

opment programs into computer collection, recycling, and reuse.

(3) Corporate—a  model  integrating  corporate  services  into  computer  collection,

recycling, and reuse.

(4) Collaborative—a  model  utilizing  partnerships  and  collaboration  to  address

computer collection and recycling.

Local  Goodwill  agencies  are  in  a  unique  position  to  support  producer  take  back
programs,  because  we  already  have  a  strong  existing  infrastructure,  and  if  any  e-
waste  legislation  is  introduced  in  Congress,  we  support  pre-emption  language  that
would  allow  states,  such  as  California,  with  the  ARF  model,  and  those  with  pro-
ducer  responsibility  take  back  programs  to  continue  running  them.  We  have  over
2,100  retail  stores  and  4,100  attended  donation  centers.  Goodwill  Industries  is  a
self-sustaining enterprise and recycling helps us to be good stewards of the environ-
ment and also to help employ people with disabilities and disadvantages.

In  the  future,  we  do  believe  advanced  product  designs  such  as  those  already  un-
dertaken in Europe would help with the challenge of e-waste. We support incentives
to  manufacturers  for  the  design  of  such  products.  Product  design  changes  could  fa-
cilitate the reuse, disassembly, and recycling of products. Standardized chargers for
cell  phones  are  an  example  of  design  changes  that  would  add  minimal  costs  to  the
product  while  achieving  substantial  impact  in  the  reuse  area.  The  Federal  Govern-
ment can play a vital role in assisting the development and sustainability of a recy-
cling/reuse  infrastructure  while  creating  green  collar  jobs  and  stimulating  research
and development in a growth industry.

The  Federal  Government,  by  utilizing  incentives,  could  aid  and  encourage  nec-
essary private sector investment in the used electronic recycling/reuse markets. This
can be done through tax credits for manufacturers who partner with social agencies,
recycling grants, and other initiatives that could spur innovative solutions and help
stakeholders  handle  this  problem.  A  partnership  consisting  of  government  incen-
tives,  private  industry  and  social  agencies  can  protect  the  environment,  create  jobs
and spur innovation in the environmental field.

Additionally, increased federal support for pilot projects and other sustainable ini-
tiatives  would  be  helpful  in  promoting  the  development  of  a  recycling/reuse  infra-
structure. The Federal Government also can play a key role in educating consumers.
We  are  currently  working  with  a  broad-based  coalition  to  help  inform  consumers
about the transition to digital television and the availability of coupons for a digital
converter.

Goodwill  Industries  looks  forward  to  working  with  the  Committee  on  exploring

the best ways to handle electronic waste. Thank you.

ing company of gypsies, Gerardo decided to settle down and get a real job at Good-
will.  Married  with  four  children,  he  finds  that  life  at  home  tends  to  be  less  than
tranquil.

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Castro.  You  and  Goodwill

should be congratulated on a very forward-thinking program.

Now  Ms.  Renee  St.  Denis  from  Hewlett  Packard,  you  are  recog-

nized.
STATEMENT  OF  MS.  RENEE  ST.  DENIS,  DIRECTOR  OF  AMER-
ICA’S  PRODUCT  TAKE-BACK  AND  RECYCLING,  HEWLETT–
PACKARD COMPANY
Ms. ST. DENIS. Good morning, Chairman Gordon, Ranking Mem-
ber  Hall  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  my  name  is  Renee  St.
Denis and I am the Director of Product Take-Back for the Hewlett-
Packard Company in America.

HP has a longstanding history of being a leader in electronics re-
cycling. We first began recycling electronics in 1987 and in 1994 we
opened  a  world-class  electronics  recycling  facility.  In  our  21  years
of  recycling  electronics,  we  have  recycled  more  than  one  billion
pounds  of  electronics  from  our  consumer,  small  and  medium  busi-
ness, and enterprise customers—quite an achievement.

We also operate a state-of-the-art printer supplies recycling facil-
ity outside Nashville, Tennessee, in Chairman Gordon’s district. All
of the material that is recycled in all of our and our partners’ U.S.
operations  are  managed  in  an  environmentally  sound  manner.  No
waste is exported for disposal overseas and no electronic materials
are sent to landfills.

In  addition  to  implementing  programs  on  the  ground  and  testi-
fying before Congress, we have played the leading role in the policy
development  and  debate  about  the  end-of-life  of  electronics  in  the
United States and indeed around the world. Based on our consider-
able  experience,  we  believe  that  appropriate  legislation  can  create
efficient, flexible recycling systems that optimize the environmental
impact, research utilization and economic benefits of electronics re-
cycling.  We  look  forward  to  continuing  to  work  with  the  Congress
on such legislation.

We  do  see  an  increasing  use  of  technology  in  the  processing  of
electronic  materials  for  recycling.  Materials  designed  for  recycling
are  first  sent  to  a  process  where  any  materials  requiring  special
handling  such  as  batteries  or  CRT  glass  are  removed  and  seg-
regated  for  processing  and  treatment.  At  that  point  large  pieces  of
metals or plastics may also be isolated and segregated for recycling.
The  residual  materials  are  sent  through  a  series  of  size  reduction
and  sorting  steps.  These  steps  include  mechanical  shredding  and
the  use  of  high-tech  material  separation  processes  such  as  eddy
currents, air tables or magnetic separation.

I am pleased to report that HP’s experience in designing and op-
erating  recycling  facilities  around  the  world  have  led  us  to  incor-
porate much of our learning into new product design. For example,
we  have  reduced  the  number  and  type  of  screws  or  fasteners  used
in new products, replaced paints and coatings on plastic parts with
molded-in  colors,  and  have  successfully  created  a  closed-loop  recy-
cling system for the plastics in our ink jet products.

However, as an industry, we still face challenges in a number of
areas  and  we  have  provided  suggestions  for  areas  of  research  in
our  written  testimony  to  help  create  a  more  efficient  recycling  in-
frastructure.  I  would  like  to  highlight  a  few  of  those  today.  In  one
example,  there  are  materials  which  have  been  used  in  products  in
the  past  which  no  longer  have  economic  value.  These  include  CRT
glass  and  plastics  with  brominated  flame  retardants.  Congress
should consider support for research into appropriate uses of these
materials outside the technology industry.

Another  challenge  is  the  inconsistent  and  somewhat  inappro-
priate  regulatory  framework  in  place  to  manage  used  electronics.
These  products  may  be  classified  as  hazardous  waste  due  to  the
testing  protocols  used  to  assess  the  risk  of  managing  them.  The
tests used to assess these risks were developed for assessing indus-
trial  waste,  not  products  that  we  routinely  use  every  day  in  our
homes and offices. The tests can give misleading and contradictory
results.  The  resulting  regulatory  classification  that  is  put  in  place
creates  burdensome  and  costly  regulatory  requirements  and  im-
pedes  the  development  of  a  cost-effective  recycling  infrastructure
while  not  creating  any  additional  environmental  protection.  Con-
gress  could  help  to  foster  the  development  of  an  electronics  recy-
cling infrastructure by conducting research into the actual environ-
mental and human health risks associated with the storage, trans-
portation,  selection  and  recycling  of  used  electronics  and  into  the
development of new, appropriate testing protocols.

Another slightly different area of research that the Congress may
want  to  consider  is  the  overall  climate  impact  of  recycling  dis-
carded  electronics.  There  is  currently  little  data  on  the  net  carbon
impacts  of  collecting,  transporting  and  processing  used  electronics.
Recycling  can  play  a  positive  role  in  addressing  climate  change  by
conserving  resources  and  displacing  the  energy  associated  with  ac-
quiring raw materials through mining or other processes. However,
the  process  of  recycling  used  electronics  will  also  generate  emis-
sions  of  greenhouse  gases  and  contribute  to  climate  change.  In  a
future  carbon-constrained  world,  all  these  impacts  must  be  better
understood.

Thank you again for the opportunity to share our views. I would

be happy to answer any questions you might have.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RENEE ST. DENIS

On  behalf  of  Hewlett-Packard  Company  (HP),  I  am  pleased  to  provide  this  testi-
mony  on  the  recycling  of  used  electronics.  My  name  is  Renee  St.  Denis,  and  I  am
Director, Americas Product Take-Back, based in Roseville, California. HP is a tech-
nology  solutions  provider  to  consumers,  businesses  and  institutions  globally.  The

HP  applauds  Chairman  Gordon  and  Ranking  Member  Hall  for  convening  this
hearing  to  discuss  electronic  waste  and  appreciates  this  opportunity  for  HP  to  tes-
tify  on  this  important  issue.  Today’s  hearing  is  a  valuable  first  step  in  informing
Members  of  the  House  and  the  public  on  the  emerging  challenge  of  managing  and
recycling  used  electronics  in  the  United  States.  HP  supports  increased  recycling  to
conserve  natural  resources  and  protect  our  environment  through  a  harmonized  na-
tional  approach.  HP  calls  on  Congress  to  support  a  national  solution  to  the  chal-
lenge  of  recycling  used  electronics,  the  adoption  of  recycling  incentives  and  the  re-
moval  of  regulatory  barriers  to  cost-effective  recycling,  and  market-based  solutions
to  finance  government  recycling  programs.  We  further  call  on  Congress  to  support
research in this area to help address challenges that are hindering the development
of a cost-effective recycling infrastructure. We offer our suggestions for research pri-
orities later in this testimony.

As  a  major  manufacturer  of  a  broad  range  of  technology  products,  as  well  as  a
leading  recycler  of  these  products,  HP  has  a  strong  interest  in  the  development  of
policies  relating  to  electronics  recycling.  HP  has  nearly  twenty  years  of  first-hand
experience  in  product  take-back  and  recycling.  Since  1987,  HP  has  successfully  col-
lected  and  recycled  more  than  one  billion  pounds  of  used  or  unwanted  computer-
related  equipment  globally.  With  our  vast  knowledge  and  experience,  HP’s  goal  is
to  recycle  an  additional  one  billion  pounds  of  equipment  (for  a  total  of  two  billion
pounds  worldwide)  by  the  end  of  2010.  HP  has  established  a  recycling  service
throughout the U.S. (as well as other countries around the world) that provides con-
sumer and commercial customers with a convenient opportunity to recycle their old
products  in  an  environmentally  sound  manner.  For  more  information  on  HP’s  envi-
ronment  and  broader  global  citizenship  activities,  see:  http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/
globalcitizenship/.

HP  currently  partners  with  operators  of  seven  large,  state-of-the-art  recycling  fa-
cilities  in  the  U.S.  and  Canada,  as  well  as  operating  our  own  technologically-ad-
vanced facility used to recycled print supplies. Our recycling facility for printer sup-
plies is located outside of Nashville, Tennessee, in the district of Chairman Gordon.
This facility consists of a 40,000 square foot building, including separation and recy-
cling  technology.  The  facility  employs  approximately  50  full  time  employees  and
processes  all  of  the  material  returned  to  HP  through  our  different  print  supplies
programs in the U.S., Canada and Latin America.

All  materials  collected  in  the  U.S.  and  recycled  by  HP  are  managed  in  the  U.S.
and  Canada  in  an  environmentally  sound  manner;  under  HP’s  program,  no  waste
materials  are  shipped  overseas  and  no  electronic  material  is  sent  to  a  landfill.  In
the past year, HP recycled almost 40 million pounds of electronic waste in the U.S.
in  2007  and  reused  or  donated  an  additional  30  million  pounds.  Including  remar-
keted equipment, we achieved a total reuse and recycling rate in 2007 of 15 percent
of  relevant  hardware  sales.  While  this  metric  attempts  to  account  for  the  time  dif-
ference  between  when  HP  products  are  sold  and  returned,  we  recognize  the  dif-
ficulty of matching returned product to the appropriate sales period, which may af-
fect the accuracy of the calculation.

HP  encourages  Congress  to  continue  to  support  technological  innovation  such  as
HP  has  employed  to  reduce  the  impact  of  electronic  products  on  the  environment
and to encourage the reuse and recycling of electronic products. Creating opportuni-
ties  and  incentives  to  support  the  innovation  of  American  companies  which  effi-
ciently  achieve  superior  recycling  results  will  help  to  best  protect  our  nation’s  nat-
ural resources for future generations.

We wish to emphasize the following points in our testimony today:

• HP’s  history  and  leadership  in  electronics  recycling,  including  the  effect  of
these  recycling  activities  on  design  and  manufacture  of  HP  products  as  a
means of reducing the overall environmental impact of our products.
• The  need  for  further  research  into  creating  innovative  recycling  and  disposal
methods for the leaded glass from CRT tubes and the older plastics from elec-
tronics  in  order  to  find  innovative,  effective  reuse  options  for  these  materials
of concern.
• Increasing  the  understanding  of  regulators,  environmental  groups,  and  the
general  public  on  the  subject  of  the  environmental  issues  surrounding  the
management  of  discarded  electronics,  and  the  appropriate  level  and  type  of
regulation  surrounding  recycling  operations  and  the  shipment  and  handling
of  whole  products.  Additional  research  on  these  issues  is  warranted  ensure
that  the  emerging  electronics  recycling  industry  can  find  market-  and  eco-
nomic-based solutions for recycling and reuse, while also providing for protec-
tion of the environment.

• The necessity of research into the net carbon or climate impact of electronics
recycling  is  crucial  to  designing  appropriate  collection,  reuse,  and  recycling
systems,  particularly  given  the  likelihood  of  future  legislation  that  limits
emissions of greenhouse gases or places greater costs on such emissions.

I. HP’S RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT IN RECYCLING ELECTRONICS

HP  has  been  recycling  used  electronics  for  over  21  years.  HP  has  made  great
strides  in  increasing  the  volume  of  our  products  recovered  for  reuse  and  recycling.
However,  the  number  of  PCs,  servers,  print  cartridges  and  other  electronics  reach-
ing  the  end  of  their  usable  life  is  growing  rapidly.  In  order  to  meet  this  need,  HP
offers  a  variety  of  recycling  services  to  customers  in  52  countries  and  territories
worldwide.

Managing  this  increasing  volume  of  discarded  equipment  conserves  natural  re-
sources  by  reducing  the  need  for  raw  materials  and  energy  to  manufacture  new
products. As such, our commitment to responsible product reuse and recycling is in-
tegral to meeting our energy efficiency objectives.

Product reuse and recycling offers other benefits as well. Remarketing used equip-
ment  is  profitable  for  HP,  and  businesses  and  consumers  are  increasingly  seeking
out manufacturers that offer responsible reuse and recycling options for used equip-
ment.  Plus,  many  governments  have  passed  legislation,  such  as  the  European
Union’s  Waste  Electrical  and  Electronic  Equipment  (WEEE)  Directive,  requiring
that  discarded  electronic  equipment  be  recycled.  Our  proactive  approach  to  product
reuse  and  recycling  helps  us  meet  legal  requirements,  maintain  access  to  markets
and win business.

HP began remarketing used equipment in 1981 and recycling in 1987. This year,
we  exceeded  our  goal  to  recycle  one  billion  pounds  (450,000  metric  tonnes)  of  elec-
tronic products and supplies by the end of 2007. We have set an aggressive new goal
to  recover  an  additional  one  billion  pounds  for  reuse  and  recycling  by  the  end  of
2010.

Beyond  that  major  milestone,  our  world  wide  efforts  in  2007  yielded  significant

progress. Specifically, we:

• Increased our annual recycling volume by more than 50 percent over 2006 to
113,000  tonnes  (250  million  pounds).  For  comparison  purposes,  the  Environ-
mental Protection Agency (EPA) has reported that our nearest competitor re-
cycled 78 million pounds. See ‘‘Plug Into e-Cycling with the EPA: 2007 Activi-
ties’’ (EPA 530–F–08–002).
• Collected approximately three million hardware units weighing 28,500 tonnes
(63  million  pounds)  for  reuse  and  remarketing,  an  increase  of  more  than  31
percent compared to 2006.
• Increased the volume recovered for reuse and recycling as a proportion of rel-

to facilitate recyclability.

We offer a range of take-back services for both companies and consumers. Respon-
sible  take-back  is  core  to  our  leasing  and  reuse  services,  and  saves  customers  time
and  expense  managing  old  equipment.  Free  return  and  recycling  is  available  for
print cartridges in 47 countries or territories. We make arrangements with commer-
cial customers depending on the equipment involved and the specific circumstances.
Consumer recycling services vary from country to country, depending partly on local
regulations.

In all cases, it is important to manage the disposal of returned equipment to pro-
tect  data  security.  We  have  safeguards  in  place  for  all  products  we  take  back,
whether by trade-in, via donation or through our recycling services.

The  equipment  returned  to  HP  is  managed  through  a  network  of  partners  and
service  providers  who  perform  the  recycling  of  the  equipment.  HP  formerly
partnered  with  a  large  electronics  recycling  company  to  operate  two  recycling  cen-
ters in the U.S.; our partner now operates these facilities with the assistance of HP.
HP  invested  in  the  development  of  those  recycling  centers  in  order  to  directly  par-
ticipate and lead the development of the types of technology and processes necessary
to recycle used electronics to the environmental and data security standards we re-
quire. Over time, an infrastructure has started to emerge which has created an abil-
ity  for  HP  to  reduce  our  focus  on  the  actual  recycling  operation  and  to  renew  our
focus on the design of products which are easier to recycle and can include recycla-

ble  commodities  in  their  manufacture  as  well  as  the  development  of  recycling  serv-
ices for our customers.

Any  reusable  equipment  is  segregated.  From  there,  any  customer  data  is  de-
stroyed  and  the  equipment  is  then  reused  either  in  whole  or  in  part.  Equipment
without a reuse channel is sent for removal of any hazardous components (typically
CRT glass, batteries or other elements). After removal of any hazardous components
the  equipment  is  either  manually  or  mechanically  separated  into  a  variety  of  basic
commodities:  various  types  of  precious  and  base  metals,  plastics  and  other  con-
stituent materials. These materials are processed in the separation process to create
valuable  commodity  streams  which  are  then  sold  for  reuse  into  a  variety  of  indus-
trial processes. These include the manufacture of new parts and products for a num-
ber of industries, including, in some cases, the electronics industry.

II. RECYCLING AND ITS IMPACT ON HP’s PRODUCT DESIGN

HP  established  our  Design  for  Environment  (DfE)  program  in  1992,  and  it  re-
mains central to our business strategy today. Our approach to DfE encompasses the
entire  product  life  cycle.  In  addition  to  considering  important  product  attributes
such as energy efficiency and materials innovation, design for recyclability (DFR) is
one of our primary design for the environment priorities. We believe that our experi-
ence  and  expertise  in  recycling  provides  an  important  feedback  loop  to  designers  to
design future products so that they can be more readily recycled.

HP’s DFR efforts include using common fasteners and snap-in features and avoid-
ing the use of screws, glues, adhesives and welds where feasible. This makes it easi-
er to dismantle products and to separate and identify different metals and plastics.
The  materials  we  choose  can  also  enhance  recyclability.  For  example,  in  2007  we
introduced  several  notebook  PC  models  with  LED  technology,  eliminating  mercury
fluorescent  tubes  and  making  the  display  screens  easier  to  manage  at  end-of-life.
These  efforts  have  significantly  improved  the  recyclability  of  HP  products,  and  we
are pleased to report the following:

• HP notebook PC products are  now  more  than  90  percent  recyclable  or  re-
coverable by weight (as per the definition used in the European Union WEEE
regulations).

• HP printing and imaging products are  typically  70  percent  to  85  percent
recyclable  or  recoverable  by  weight  (as  per  the  definition  used  in  the  Euro-
pean Union WEEE regulations).

We  also  made  great  progress  in  incorporating  recycling  materials  into  our  prod-
ucts.  For  example,  HP  has  engineered  print  cartridges  that  use  recycled  plastic
without  compromising  quality  or  reliability.  We  design  HP  print  cartridges  to  meet
the  needs  of  our  recycling  system  and  incorporate  recycled  material.  Since  we  take
back only our own cartridges, we can be certain about the material content, making
it easier to process exhausted cartridges and reuse the material to manufacture new
ones.  More  than  200  million  cartridges  have  been  manufactured  using  the  process
through  2007.  HP  used  more  than  five  million  pounds  (2,300  tonnes)  of  recycled
plastic in its original HP inkjet cartridges in 2007, and the company has committed
to  using  twice  as  much  in  2008.  HP  also  uses  post-consumer  recycled  plastic  recov-
ered  through  our  return  and  recycling  program  in  the  manufacture  of  original  HP
LaserJet print cartridges. This recycled plastic can represent as much as 25 percent,
by  weight,  of  the  newly  molded  LaserJet  cartridge  housing.  HP  has  also  incor-
porated recycled content into some hardware products. For example, in 2007, we in-
troduced  a  speaker  module  made  from  100  percent  post-consumer  recycled  plastics
in all HP Compaq 6500 and 6700 series Notebook PCs.

We  strive  to  use  recycled  plastics  in  our  products,  but  their  potential  is  limited

for several reasons:

• Most recycled plastics contain substances such as BFRs, which we have elimi-
nated  from  the  external  cases  of  our  current  products.  (See  Part  III  below).
• Mixed  plastics  do  not  have  the  mechanical  properties  necessary  for  use  in
• It is difficult to separate dissimilar plastics during recycling to produce a ho-

new IT products.

mogeneous material.

As  we  discuss  in  further  detail  below,  Congress  should  consider  supporting  re-
search on ways to promote the use of recycled materials in future products and help
overcome these challenges.

As  one  outside  observer  states  in  HP’s  Global  Citizenship  Report  (see  http://

www.hp.com/hpinfo/globalcitizenship/gcreport/productreuse/perspectives.html) :

HP has made significant strides in design for recycling. Its engineering and de-
sign  teams  have  taken  into  account  the  concerns  of  refurbishers  and  recyclers
by  creating  products  that  can  easily  be  repaired,  refurbished,  disassembled  or
recycled. Such enhancement in product design has been augmented by the com-
pany’s assistance to recyclers, making available to them guidelines that greatly
simplify the recycling process.
Among the latest of the company’s techniques in the area of design for recycling
is  the  concept  of  modular  design,  which  combined  with  the  use  of  the  proper
‘‘environmentally-friendly’’  materials  help  HP  to  increasingly  establish  itself  as
a  leading  ‘‘green’’  IT  supplier.  HP  further  pushed  to  reduce  its  products’  envi-
ronmental impact by incorporating more easily recyclable plastics, reducing the
number  of  different  plastic  types  in  a  single  product  and  replacing  coating  and
paint  with  molded-in  colors.  Furthermore,  reuse,  as  a  way  to  extend  the  life  of
a  system,  has  been  facilitated  by  HP’s  modular  design  approach,  enabling  sim-
ple component swapping during the refurbishing process.

These efforts have resulted in HP products qualifying for a large number of global
ecolabels,  including  the  EPEAT  (Electronic  Product  Environmental  Assessment
Tool)  designation  in  the  U.S.  HP  is  working  hard  to  improve  our  record  of  success
in this area, including establishing the following goals:

• Double  the  use  of  recycled  plastic  in  print  cartridges  in  2008  compared  to

2007, to 4,500 tonnes (10 million pounds)

• Eliminate the remaining uses of BFRs and PVC from new computing products
launched in 2009 as technologically feasible alternatives become readily avail-
able that will not compromise product performance or quality and will not ad-
versely impact health or the environment

III. INNOVATION  NEEDED  TO  INCREASE  THE  RECYCLABILITY  OF

ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS

There  are  two  materials  which  present  particular  challenges  to  the  current  recy-
cling  processes  used  within  the  electronics  industry  and  which  will  present  even
greater  challenges  as  time  progresses.  These  materials  are  (a)  the  leaded  glass
found  in  CRT  tubes  and  (b)  plastics  which  may  contain  flame  retardant  additives
which have been banned from further use in many countries in the world.

A. CRT glass

Cathode  Ray  Tubes  (CRTs)  are  the  glass  picture  tubes  found  in  previous  genera-
tions  of  computer  monitors,  televisions,  and  other  displays.  CRTs  contain  leaded
glass for two reasons:

• It  improves  the  optical  quality  of  the  glass.  Adding  a  small  amount  of  lead
to  glass  is  very  common  when  creating  glass  for  lenses,  and  you  may  have
also  heard  of  leaded  crystal.  Optical  quality  is  especially  important  at  the
front of the CRT.

• It  acts  as  a  shield  against  radiation  generated  by  the  electron  gun  and  elec-

tron beam.

Users  of  computer  equipment  are  in  the  process  of  transitioning  from  CRT  dis-
plays  to  flat  panel  technologies,  but  large  volumes  of  traditional  CRT  displays  re-
main in use or in storage. This presents a recycling and logistical challenge. Among
other  things,  one  important  challenge  is  the  limited  current  opportunities  to  reuse
leaded CRT glass. Congress should consider support for research in new applications
for leaded glass in building, the medical field, and other applications.

B. Plastics containing banned/restricted flame retardants

Both  the  internal  circuit  boards  and  the  external  plastic  housings  of  electronic
products  contain  chemical  flame  retardants  for  fire  safety  purposes.  Many  of  the
chemical  flame  retardants  used  in  the  past,  such  as  brominated  flame  retardants
(BFRs),  have  come  under  increasing  scrutiny  by  environmental  and  health  officials
in  many  countries,  and  several  U.S.  states  and  many  countries  have  banned  or  re-
stricted the use of some of these chemicals. These chemicals cannot be removed from
the plastics, so as a result the presence of these chemicals in plastic parts presents
a  significant  recycling  and  reuse  challenge.  To  address  this  concern,  Congress
should  consider  support  for  research  on  reuse  opportunities  for  plastics  containing
banned or restricted chemicals.

IV. RESEARCH  NEEDED  ON  THE  PROPER  REGULATORY  APPROACH

FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF USED ELECTRONICS

The Federal Government can play an important role in promoting recycling by es-
tablishing  an  appropriate  regulatory  framework  for  managing  used  electronics,  in-
cluding  the  removal  of  regulatory  impediments  to  cost-effective  recycling.  Under
some  interpretations  of  current  federal  and  State  regulations,  used  electronics  may
be  classified  as  ‘‘hazardous  waste,’’  even  though  they  are  routinely  used  in  our
homes and offices and pose no risk to human health or the environment when prop-
erly  stored,  transported,  and  recycled.  When  these  used  products  are  classified  as
hazardous waste, they become subject to burdensome and costly regulatory require-
ments  associated  with  their  collection,  storage,  transportation,  and  processing.
When  classified  as  ‘‘hazardous,’’  these  regulations  can  impede  the  development  of  a
cost-effective  recycling  infrastructure  without  adding  to  greater  environmental  pro-
tection. Congress and the EPA should work to reform these regulatory requirements
to  facilitate  recycling  of  used  electronics,  while  continuing  to  protect  human  health
and the environment.

Additional  research  should  be  conducted  regarding  the  actual  environmental  and
human  health  risks  associated  with  the  storage,  transport,  and  recycling  of  used
electronics. This research should also consider whether new test methods for assess-
ing these risks should be developed, instead of the current practice of using the test
method developed and employed for testing industrial process waste.

V. RESEARCH  INTO  THE  NET  CLIMATE  IMPACT  OF  RECYCLING  OF

ELECTRONICS
Another area that warrants further research is the overall climate impact of recy-
cling  discarded  electronics.  There  is  currently  little  data  on  the  net  carbon  impacts
of collecting, transporting, and processing large volumes of discarded electronics. In
a future ‘‘carbon constrained’’ world, these impacts need to be better understood.

Recycling  can  play  a  positive  role  in  addressing  climate  change  by  conserving  re-
sources  such  as  precious  metals  contained  in  electronics,  and  displacing  the  energy
impacts  associated  with  mining  or  otherwise  producing  necessary  raw  materials.
But  the  process  of  collecting  and  transporting  these  products  on  a  large  scale  will
also  generate  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases,  and  therefore  contribute  to  climate
change.  We  need  a  better  understanding  of  whether  the  benefits  of  recycling  these
products  outweigh  the  potential  adverse  climate  impacts  associated  with  this  activ-
ity, as well as ways of mitigating any adverse impacts. Unfortunately, little research
has  been  done  in  this  area  to  enable  policy-makers  and  industry  to  understand
these  impacts  and  assess  ways  of  mitigating  them.  These  climate  impacts  can  also
have  an  important  effect  on  the  economics  of  e-recycling  in  a  future  world  where
emissions of greenhouse gases are capped or otherwise restricted.

V. CONCLUSION

HP  is  committed  to  strengthening  our  leadership  in  e-recycling  and  innovative
product  design.  We  have  suggested  a  number  of  areas  for  further  research  that
would  enable  HP  and  others  in  the  tech  industry  to  do  a  better  job  at  these  tasks.
HP  looks  forward  to  working  with  the  Subcommittee  and  other  Members  of  Con-
gress on the development of a national recycling system that leverages the capabili-
ties  and  expertise  of  manufacturers,  retailers,  recyclers,  and  others  to  achieve  effi-
cient and low cost opportunities for all consumers.

Mr. Eric Harris is recognized.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  ERIC  HARRIS,  ASSOCIATE  COUNSEL/DI-
RECTOR  OF  GOVERNMENT  AND  INTERNATIONAL  AFFAIRS,
INSTITUTE OF SCRAP RECYCLING INDUSTRIES
Mr.  HARRIS.  Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee,  good
morning.  My  name  is  Eric  Harris.  I  am  here  today  representing
ISRI,  the  Institute  of  Scrap  Recycling  Industries.  ISRI  is  the
world’s  largest  trade  association  of  recyclers  with  1,550  member
companies  and  over  3,000  facilities  throughout  the  United  States.
Our  members  process,  broker,  and  industrially  consume  a  number
of recyclable commodities including metal, ferrous and non-ferrous,
paper,  plastic,  glass,  textiles,  tires  and  rubber,  and  of  course,  elec-
tronics.  Twenty  percent  of  ISRI’s  membership  now  focuses  on  elec-
tronic  recycling.  In  fact,  it  is  our  association’s  fastest  growing  seg-
ment.

Our  electronics  recyclers  provide  comprehensive  recycling  oper-
ations,  everything  from  logistics,  including  collection  and  transpor-
tation, to asset management, that is, cleaning hard drives and test-
ing  and  reselling  for  reuse,  and  of  course  processing  electronics
scrap  to  extract  the  various  commodities  such  as  steel,  gold,  tita-
nium,  silver,  copper,  plastics,  and  glass  for  use  as  valuable  mate-
rial feedstock in the manufacturing of new products.

So what are some of the key challenges for electronics recyclers?
The  first,  something  very  sensitive  to  our  industry,  is  hosting  this
issue with the moniker of waste. In our opinion, scrap is not waste
and recycling is not disposal. It is very important to distinguish be-
tween  scrap  and  waste  as  well  as  recycling  and  disposal.  Simply
stated,  scrap  is  the  opposite  of  waste.  Electronic  scrap  like  scrap
paper  and  glass  and  plastic  and  metal  and  so  forth  is  not  waste
when  responsibly  recycled.  Defining  scrap  electronics  as  waste  un-
dermines  and  overlooks  the  values  that  those  electronics  retain
when properly recycled.

One of the other biggest concerns we have in the industry is the
cost  to  collect,  transport,  and  responsibly  recycle  household  elec-
tronic equipment, which remains the greatest challenge for our in-
dustry for two primary reasons. Household electronics, as Mr. Wil-
liams  has  already  pointed  out,  some  of  the  equipment  has  a  nega-
tive  cost  to  recycle.  In  other  words,  it  costs  more  to  recycle  the
equipment than the value you can extract from processing it. In ad-
dition, existing law, federal law, allows household electronic equip-
ment to be sent to subtitle D landfills. This creates a tension in the
market  because  we  lack  the  contractual  connection  with  the  con-
sumer  and  there  is  a  behavioral  pattern  that  suggests  that  this
equipment should continue going to the landfill.

Because  of  these  reasons,  until  a  sustainable  market  presents
itself,  ISRI  does  support  a  short-term  financial  mechanism  from
OEMs  that  would  allow  us  to  have  help  to  collect,  transport,  and
responsibly  recycle  those  household  electronic  equipment  goods

that  have  a  negative  cost  to  recycle,  for  example,  the  cathode  ray
tubes  in  the  televisions  and  monitors  of  today’s  market.  There  are
three  primary  reasons  why,  this  will  enhance  competition  and  not
inflate the value of the recycling service that our members provide.
The  OEMs  have  greater  access  to  their  own  customers.  They  can
convince  and  educate  their  customers  on  the  value  of  responsibly
recycling  the  materials  they  sell.  And  lastly,  it  provides  an  incen-
tive for the OEMs to design their products with an eye towards re-
cycling.  A  great  example  in  today’s  market  is  manufacturers’  con-
tinued  use  of  mercury  in  their  products.  If  you  see  the  flat-screen
monitors and televisions, if you take the time to refurbish that sys-
tem,  pull  the  back  panel  off,  what  you  will  see  is  a  row  of  fluores-
cent  bulbs  that  have  mercury  powder.  They  are  difficult  to  replace
and they are difficult to remove for recycling. As a result, they are
not cost-effective in today’s market. We need to encourage more col-
laborative  programs  to  work  with  the  OEMs  to  improve  their  de-
sign.

On the commodity side, we need better markets for scrap plastics
and  scrap  glass.  CRT  glass-to-glass  manufacturing  is  becoming
more  and  more  obsolete  throughout  the  world,  and  the  few  lead
smelters  that  are  remaining  are  actually  refusing  new  contracts
from recyclers to process their CRT glass. This is only complicated
further  by  the  four  to  eight  pounds  of  leaded  glass  that  we  see  in
the monitors and TVs entering in today’s market. As a result, recy-
clers  have  fewer  and  fewer  markets  for  the  CRT  glass.  In  our
terms, this is a barn-burning issue: what do we do with the glass?
For  plastic,  it  remains  difficult  to  separate  and  sort  commingled
plastic  resin  streams  to  the  quality  that  compete  with  virgin  plas-
tics.  You  have  to  imagine  a  truckload  of  commingled  electronics
from  toaster  ovens  to  monitors  to  radios  shows  up  at  our  facility
and  now  we  have  to  process  that  material  and  process  the  plastic
to a point where it can compete with virgin plastic. This is a chal-
lenge.

All in all, what this does is creates hesitancy in the marketplace.
Recyclers  are  hesitant  to  further  invest  in  the  technology  needed
for greater automation and optical sorting to address the CRT glass
and the plastic. So how do we inject investor confidence? We would
suggest  targeted  research  and  development  to  new  and  used  mar-
kets  for  mixed  scrap  plastic  and  glass  and  potentially  investment
incentives  for  new  recycling  equipment  such  as  an  accelerated  de-
preciation  model  for  new  recycling  equipment  that  is  energy  effi-
cient  and  climate  friendly  and  designed  to  increase  recyclable
yields.

And  lastly,  how  do  we  find  a  responsible  recycler?  There  are  a
spectrum of players on the market from the leaders of our associa-
tion all the way down to what we call the sham recyclers out there,
and we would caution the Committee for the need for new laws and
regulations and would encourage enhancing policy that rewards re-
sponsible  recycling.  On  our  side  of  the  equation,  we  have  created
a Recycling Industry Operating Standard, or RIOS, that is an inte-
grated, comprehensive management system that incorporates envi-
ronment, health and safety and quality goals for the recycler in to-
morrow’s market.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ERIC HARRIS

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  Good  Morning.  My  name  is  Eric
Harris  and  I  am  the  Associate  Counsel  and  Director  of  Government  and  Inter-
national  Affairs  for  the  Institute  of  Scrap  Recycling  Industries,  Inc.—the  ‘‘Voice  of
the Recycling Industry.’’
Introduction

ISRI  is  the  world’s  largest  trade  association  of  recyclers  with  well  over  1,550
member companies that operate over 3,000 locations in the United States who proc-
ess,  broker  and  industrially  consume  scrap  commodities,  including  metals,  paper,
plastics, glass, rubber, textiles and electronics. More than 20 percent of ISRI’s mem-
bership  is  involved  in  electronic  scrap  processing  and  industrial  consumption  of
scrap material generated by electronics recyclers. In fact, electronics recycling is the
fastest growing segment of ISRI’s membership.

In  2007,  the  domestic  scrap  recycling  industry  manufactured  approximately  $71
billion  of  specification  grade  commodities  that  were  used  in  lieu  of  virgin  materials
to manufacture basic products in the United States and throughout the world. This
figure includes more than 81 million tons of iron and steel, five million tons of alu-
minum,  1.8  million  tons  of  copper,  and  two  million  tons  of  stainless  steel,  just  to
name  a  few.  Of  the  $71  billion  of  scrap  recycled  last  year,  nearly  $22  billion  worth
of  these  commodities  were  exported  to  152  countries  worldwide,  making  a  signifi-
cant  positive  contribution  to  the  United  States’  balance  of  trade  with  other  nations
and  serving  as  the  first  link  in  the  global  manufacturing  supply  chain.  Scrap  ac-
counts for approximately 40 percent of the world’s raw material needs.

Scrap  recycling  is  one  of  the  world’s  most  climate  friendly  activities.  The  use  of
recycled  scrap  materials  to  manufacture  new  products  sustains  the  Earth’s  natural
resources,  while  at  the  same  time,  conserves  impressive  amounts  of  energy  in  the
manufacturing  process,  and  thereby  significantly  reduces  greenhouse  gas  emissions
from those facilities.

For example, recycling 1,000 computers and monitors rather than landfilling them
would prevent a net total of 52.64 metric tons of carbon equivalent (MTCE) and 193
metric  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  (MTCO2)  from  entering  the  atmosphere.
This is the equivalent of not driving 42 cars for an entire year. This would also save
over 3,370 million BTUs. And, the energy savings would equal 27,171 gallons of gas-
oline.1
U.S. Electronic Scrap Generation and Recycling

Approximately  2.8  billion  pounds  (1.4  million  tons)  of  electronic  equipment  were
recycled in 2006, including 65 million units of computer equipment (CPUs, monitors
and  printers).  The  electronics  recycling  process  yielded  approximately  1.3  billion
pounds  of  recyclable  materials,  more  than  half  of  which  were  metals.  Consumer
electronics,  alone,  are  now  considered  to  be  approaching  more  than  three  million
tons generated annually.

According  to  a  recent  study  by  the  Consumer  Reports  National  Research  Center,
E–Waste  2006,  90  percent  of  Americans  own  at  least  one  computer.  That  means
there are over 270 million computers in America. However, 45 percent of American
consumers  retain  electronics  because  they  are  unsure  of  the  appropriate  method  to
deal with such items at the end of their useful lives. Moreover, 35 percent of Amer-
ican  consumers  retain  electronics  because  they  consider  it  inappropriate  to  dispose
of  them  with  the  garbage.  Consequently,  upwards  of  50  percent  of  American  con-
sumers  have  yet  to  send  their  obsolete  electronic  equipment  into  the  recycling
stream.

With  the  proliferation  of  new  electronic  products  every  day,  obsolete  consumer
electronic  equipment  levels  are  expected  to  increase  to  400  million  units  annually
during  the  rest  of  the  decade,  including  100  million  units  of  computer  equipment.
If  we  combine  both  consumer  and  non-consumer  computer  equipment  (commercial,
industrial and government sectors), we can estimate that more than two billion will
become obsolete over the next five years.

ISRI  members  provide  comprehensive  recycling  operations,  which  covers  every-
thing from logistics (e.g., collection and transportation) and data security to de-man-
ufacturing,  to  manufacturing  specification  grade  commodities  from  the  electronic
products.  Our  members  make  their  living  scrubbing  and  reselling  hard  drives,  by
testing and then reselling cell phones, monitors and CPUs that are in good working
order, and using machinery and equipment to shred or otherwise process electronics

to  extract  the  various  commodities  that  are  contained  in  electronic  equipment  in-
cluding  steel,  aluminum,  gold,  silver,  titanium,  copper,  nickel,  plastic  and  glass—
for use as valuable raw material feedstock in the manufacture of new products.

Once  electronics  products  reach  our  members  they  are  first  triaged  to  determine
whether they are to be resold, refurbished, or processed into specification commodity
streams.

Whether the decision is made to refurbish or process into specification grade com-
modities,  the  export  market  for  the  resulting  product  is  an  essential  part  of  the  le-
gitimate  recycling  chain.  With  regard  to  reusable  or  refurbished  electronics,  there
is  an  increasing  presence  of  large  for-profit  reuse  markets  in  developing  countries,
especially  Asia,  Africa,  and  South  America,  where  the  majority  of  the  population
simply cannot afford to purchase the latest available technology. It is both environ-
mentally and socially responsible to provide for the continued export of these viable
products  that  make  basic  technologies  and  communications  available  where  they
would otherwise potentially not be. There is now even a growing market in the third
world for the purchase of monitors to be converted into TVs.

As  a  result  of  the  above,  recycling  experts  anticipate  that  as  collection  of  house-
hold electronic equipment in the United States increases, exports of certain recycla-
ble  streams  will  also  increase;  for  example,  used,  intact  equipment  for  reuse;  used
components for reuse; used equipment for refurbishment; and, fully processed mate-
rials for use as raw materials in manufacturing.
Key Challenges

The  key  challenges  to  increasing  electronics  recycling  in  the  United  States  in-
clude, among other things: (1) how to adequately cover the costs associated with col-
lection,  transportation  and  recycling  of  household  electronic  equipment;  (2)  distin-
guishing scrap from waste and not over regulating; (3) free and fair trade; (4) devel-
oping  adequate  end-use  markets  for  recyclable  plastics  and  glass  and  demand  for
that material; (5) Design for Recycling; and, (6) promoting EPA’s Responsible Recy-
cler practices and ISRI’s Recycling Industry Operating Standard (RIOS) as the prop-
er means to address environmental concerns.

How to adequately cover the costs?

The cost to responsibly recycle electronic products remains the greatest challenge
for recyclers. As the competition to collect household computer equipment increases
across the country, recyclers are being forced to take in a growing list of older, less
valuable  electronic  equipment,  such  as  televisions,  AM/FM  radios,  and  old
hairdryers. Under current market conditions, much of the collected electronic equip-
ment, for example at weekend collection events, has little to no resale value and has
a net-negative cost to recycle (the cost to recycle the equipment outweighs the value
of the processed material). This problem is only exacerbated when you factor in the
logistical  challenges  and  associated  costs  to  get  the  collected  electronic  equipment
transported to a facility that can responsibly recycle it.

As  a  result,  until  such  time  as  the  market  for  recyclable  electronics  becomes  eco-
nomically  viable,  ISRI’s  policy  continues  to  support  holding  producers  responsible
for  the  collection,  transportation  and  recycling  of  household  electronic  equipment
that  has  a  net-negative  cost  to  recycle,  such  as  cathode  ray  tubes  in  monitors  and
televisions.  ISRI  firmly  believes  that  producer  responsibility  will  provide  manufac-
turers with the needed incentive to design their products with an eye to the future,
incorporating  design  changes  that  maximize  recycling  at  the  end-of-life.  This  con-
cept,  which  ISRI  calls  Design  for  Recycling,  is  critical  to  the  success  of  increasing
the recycling of electronics long term. In the interim, as successful business people,
we believe that if given the flexibility and opportunity to internalize the costs manu-
factures  will  create  a  model  that  will  be  less  bureaucratic  and  burdensome  and
cheaper for the tax payer.

While  ISRI  will  ultimately  defer  to  the  wisdom  of  the  Congress  and  the  states  to
decide  which  financial  mechanism  is  most  apt  to  spur  markets  for  electronic  recy-
cling, we strongly encourage the Congress and the states to end any financial mech-
anism as soon as markets for recyclable electronics become economically viable. We
are not an industry that seeks government subsidies, and we believe markets must
ultimately stand on their own based on solid business principles.

However, whatever financial mechanism the Congress and the states might decide
to adopt in order to sustain this market, ISRI suggests that a portion should be ap-
plied  to  the  research  and  development  of  end-use  markets  for  the  scrap  materials
recovered from electronics products, particularly plastics and glass.

Scrap is not Waste, Recycling is not Disposal

33

For  recycling  in  general,  and  particularly  for  electronics  recycling,  we  need  to
avoid  creating  unnecessary  impediments.  It  is  very  important  to  distinguish  be-
tween scrap and waste as well as recycling and disposal. Simply stated, scrap is the
opposite of waste. Processed scrap materials are commodities that have a significant
value  on  domestic  and  international  markets  as  raw  material  feedstocks  that  sub-
stitute  for  virgin  materials  in  the  manufacture  of  new  basic  materials  such  as  cop-
per,  steel,  and  plastics.  Unlike  scrap,  ‘waste’  has  no  value  and  is  typically  buried
in a landfill.

Electronics  scrap,  like  scrap  paper,  glass,  plastic,  metal,  textiles,  and  rubber,  is
not waste when recycled. Defining scrap electronics as waste undermines and over-
looks  the  value  that  these  electronics  retain,  if  properly  recycled.  Saddling  them
with  the  moniker  of  ‘‘waste’’  imposes  a  whole  host  of  unwarranted  regulatory  bur-
dens  that  will  undermine  the  ability  to  allow  the  recycling  system  to  operate  effec-
tively and efficiently.

Private sector electronics recyclers are subject to all the federal and State environ-
mental,  safety,  and  export/import  regulations  that  are  applicable  to  any  industrial
operations. For example, recyclers currently operate under a host of applicable envi-
ronmental  regulations,  such  as  permitting  requirements  in  the  Clean  Air  Act,  the
Clean Water Act and its various storm water provisions, among others. In addition,
electronics  recyclers  adhere  to  State  requirements  which  in  some  cases  are  more
stringent  than  the  corresponding  federal  requirements,  federal  and  State  transpor-
tation  and  occupational  safety  and  health  laws,  U.S.  export  laws  and  regulations
and  the  import  requirements  of  foreign  countries,  such  as  those  administered  by
China’s General Administration on Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine
(AQSIQ).

For  these  reasons,  it  is  critically  important  that  we  avoid  confusing  the  valuable
commodities  manufactured  by  scrap  recyclers  with  wastes,  whether  in  our
vernacular or in written form.

Free and Fair Trade

Another  key  aspect  underlying  ISRI’s  policy  is  the  concept  of  free  and  fair  trade.
We have been in the recycling business a long time and experience tells us that the
specification  grade  commodities  we  manufacture  are  some  of  the  best  examples  of
basic  supply  and  demand  economics.  These  materials  are  traded  in  the  global  mar-
ketplace, supplying America’s basic manufacturing industries with valuable raw ma-
terial  feed  stocks  that  are  used  in  place  of  virgin  materials,  and  also  contributing
significantly towards a positive balance of trade with other nations. And these glob-
al  markets  are  far  from  new—the  London  Metal  Exchange  started  trading  copper
in 1876, harnessing an already existing global market in copper.

Despite  the  realities  of  the  global  marketplace,  however,  exporting  electronic
scrap continues to be besmirched. We have all seen the horrendous photographs and
broadcasts  regarding  China’s  artisan  communities.  But,  there  has  been  little  to  no
coverage  regarding  China’s  sophisticated  recycling  parks,  which  have  been  devel-
oped  in  China  over  the  past  ten  years  in  an  effort  by  the  Chinese  government  to
reign  in  the  ‘‘rogue  recyclers’’  who  have  been  responsible  for  some  terrible  situa-
tions. However, costs and demand for scrap material is still driving the market. Ex-
perts tend to agree that this is largely being driven by the fact that most of all new
electronic equipment is being manufactured in Asian markets. As a result, since de-
mand  is  so  high,  Asian  brokers  are  able  to  pay  more  for  the  obsolete  electronic
equipment  than  in  Europe  and  the  United  States.  Thus,  countries  like  China  con-
tinue  to  purchase  obsolete  electronic  equipment  from  countries  all  over  the  world,
including the United States.

ISRI  contends  that  the  stigma  associated  with  ‘‘exporting’’  is  misguided  and  ex-
ports  should  be  viewed  from  the  prism  of  the  realities  of  the  global  economy.  The
focus  must  be  to  promote  responsible  recycling  globally  and  concentrate  efforts  to-
wards  enhancing  and  promoting  environmentally  capable  facilities  that  will  receive
and  properly  handle  recycled  materials  anywhere  in  the  world.  ISRI  suggests  that
the  United  States  government  should  refocus  its  attention  on  negotiating  trade
agreements  with  key  trading  partners  around  the  world,  such  as  China  and  India.
These agreements could detail the environmental and safety requirements for these
facilities and establish a process that would allow the materials to flow more on the
basis of value of the commodity and less on the geographic location of the collection.

Markets for Plastic and Glass

34

Two  of  the  greatest  challenges  of  electronics  recycling  are  the  difficulties  in  recy-
cling  chemically  coated  glass  from  cathode  ray  tubes  (CRTs)  and  sorting  the  dif-
ferent resins of plastic.

ISRI has suggested that State bills and a federal bill should focus on establishing
a short-term financial subsidy for consumer generated monitors and televisions with
CRTs.  Moreover,  additional  markets  for  the  recycled  glass  are  a  critical  necessity.
If CRT manufacturing is, as most predict, soon to be obsolete and lead smelters con-
tinue to charge a fee analogous to a hazardous waste landfill fee then recyclers need
alternative end-use markets for that CRT glass. ISRI strongly recommends that re-
search and development dollars need to be invested to develop alternative markets.
With regard to plastics, despite the continual improvement in automation and op-
tical  sorting  technology  (which  helps  distinguish  between  different  colors  and
streams,  due  to  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  input  materials)  sorting  variations  of
mixed plastic resins remains a challenge for recyclers. In addition, since the market
for engineered plastics is not fully developed in the United States, the vast majority
of  baled  plastic  is  being  exported.  And,  although  foreign  markets  are  driving  the
price  of  baled  plastic  in  the  right  direction,  the  stigma  on  exporting,  in  general,  is
creating a lack of confidence in the U.S. market.

Although no single technology has solved the task of sorting plastic to a level that
can  compete  against  virgin  resin  streams,  the  technology  has  improved.  What  is
lacking is investor confidence in the overall market. ISRI contends that as the mar-
ket  matures  and  end-use  markets  for  plastic  and  glass  develop  investment  dollars
will  follow.  Similar  to  CRT  glass,  research  and  development  dollars  are  needed  to
help  develop  new  end-use  markets  for  mixed  plastics  scrap.  This  will  create  more
opportunities in the market place and thus increase investment confidence in exist-
ing optical and sorting technology.

Targeting  funds  to  advance  technology  in  these  two  fields  would  have  a  positive
impact  on  making  end-use  consumer  markets  more  economically  viable,  which
would, over time, ensure these markets could stand on their own without a subsidy.
In  fact,  ISRI  believes  it  would  be  wholly  appropriate  for  the  Congress  to  support
research  efforts  aimed  toward  the  development  of  technologies  that  could  remove
the  remaining  impediments  in  plastics  and  glass  in  order  to  utilize  these  materials
in the manufacturing process.
Designing for Recycling

Removing  hazardous  components  from  scrap  electronic  equipment  and  sorting
through  material  that  is  difficult  to  recycle,  such  as  mixed  plastics,  costs  recyclers
time  and  money.  ISRI  has  long  advocated  working  with  manufactures  to  design
their  products  to  be  easily  recycled  at  the  end  of  their  useful  lives,  without  using
hazardous, toxic constituents, or impediments that can hinder the recycling of those
products.
To  date,  voluntary  calls  by  the  recycling  industry  to  motivate  manufacturers  to
adopt a Design for Recycling philosophy have been met with only a tepid response.
We  do  recognize  that  electronics  manufacturers  have  taken  some  steps  towards  de-
signing for recycling; however, there is significant room for improvement. For exam-
ple,  manufacturers  use  of  mercury.  The  new  technology  in  flat  screen  monitors  uti-
lizes  a  system  of  lamps  containing  mercury  powder.  These  mercury  lamps  are  very
time  consuming  to  remove  or  replace,  which  makes  this  new  technology  difficult  to
recycle. Similarly, some of the cell phone batteries with small traces of mercury take
up to five minutes to remove. And, laptops contain tiny mercury lamps that are very
difficult  to  locate  and  remove.  In  the  end,  it  takes  a  lot  of  extra  time  to  recycle  in
the  proper  manner.  This  drives  up  the  labor  costs,  which  makes  recycling  these
products  less  profitable.  Design  for  Recycling  will  help  to  avoid  these  additional
costs and improve recycling efficiency.

More collaborative opportunities are needed to think through some of these design
issues before these products reach the market. For example, EPEAT is an electronic
product  design  standard  adopted  by  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  that  has
been  very  successful  in  the  marketplace.  Most  major  computer  manufacturers  are
using EPEAT as their measure of environmental product design, and are competing
to  gain  additional  credits  from  EPEAT  by  going  beyond  what  other  OEMs  have
done. Some manufacturers have incorporated significant amounts of recycled plastic
in  their  products.  This  creates  demand  for  recycled  plastics  from  computers  which
increases the value that recyclers can capture for the material. Similar types of pro-
grams could be encouraged by the Congress.

EPA’s  Responsible  Recycler  Practices  and  ISRI’s  Recycling  Industry  Operating

Standard

35

For  the  past  two  years,  ISRI  has  represented  electronics  recyclers  in  a  multi-
stakeholder process to develop responsible recycling practices (R2) for electronics re-
cyclers.  The  Environmental  Protection  Agency  has  convened  and  facilitated  this  ef-
fort.  Once  completed,  ISRI  intends  to  incorporate  this  set  of  specific  performance
practices into its Recycling Industry Operating Standard (RIOS) for electronics recy-
clers.

ISRI  developed  RIOS  as  an  integrated  management  system  standard  designed
specifically  for  the  scrap  recycling  industry  and  the  ANSI–ASQ  National  Accredita-
tion  Board  will  oversee  the  third  party  registrars  who  will  audit  recyclers.  It  pro-
vides  electronic  recyclers  with  an  affordable  tool  to  monitor  their  quality,  environ-
mental,  health  and  safety  goals.  Few  industries  worldwide  have  endeavored  to  un-
dertake  such  a  huge  step,  but  the  recycling  industry  in  the  United  States  has  al-
ways been, and intends to remain, the global leader in recycling technology, environ-
mental protection, worker safety and the production of high quality materials. RIOS
is  a  tool  for  us  to  accomplish  those  goals  and  will  help  assure  that  ISRI  members
who recycle scrap electronics will do so in a manner that is best for our country and
the world in which we live.

ISRI is hopeful that the combination of the EPA led effort, R2, and RIOS will pro-
vide  a  ‘‘one-stopshop’’  for  electronics  recyclers.  This  will  help  to  build  needed  con-
fidence  in  the  market  place  and  reward  responsible  recyclers  that  are  willing  to  be
audited to a set of requirements in an open and transparent process.

Conclusion

In closing, I want to remind the Committee that our members have provided sta-
ble,  good-paying  jobs  in  this  country  during  the  boom  years,  the  lean  years,  in  war
time, and in peace time. In one capacity or another, ISRI members have been recy-
cling electronics for decades as an integral part of their recycling operations. We feel
these  experiences  from  our  membership  will  assist  the  Committee  in  developing  ef-
fective  solutions  that  will  help  address  the  onslaught  of  consumer  based  electronic
products that are now entering the market.

Thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  address  the  Committee  today.  ISRI  looks  for-
ward  to  future  opportunities  to  work  with  the  Committee  to  continue  advancing
these and other solutions on issues important to recycling.

address  the  issues  of  health,  environment,  and  the  development  of
the electronics industry.

I  want  to  run  through  several  slides  very  quickly.  The  problem
I think is multifaceted, as you have heard. The products don’t last
very  long.  The  equipment  is  toxic.  More  e-waste  is  thrown  away
than is recycled. More recyclers simply export their products to de-
veloping  countries  and  the  toxic  components  resulting  from  poor
design make e-waste hard to recycle. The shrinking lifespans is one

of  the  serious  issues  that  we  face.  New  technology  drives  con-
sumers to buy new products at astonishing rates. The prediction is
32 million new television sets will be sold this year and 22 million
new computers will be sold, and the February 17, 2009, digital con-
version  deadline  is  rapidly  approaching.  We  predict  that  this  is
going  to  mean  millions  more  televisions  will  be  coming  into  our
waste stream over the next few years.

You  have  heard  that  e-waste  is  toxic—lead,  mercury,  cadmium,
brominated flame retardants. Our landfills are beginning to fill up.
It is still a small percentage of our landfill waste but it is the fast-
est  growing,  as  you  have  heard,  and  of  all  the  equipment  that  is
currently  being  collected,  we  predict  that  something  like  87.5  per-
cent is currently being trashed and only 12.5 percent is being recy-
cled.  And  this  is  the  key:  Of  the  products  that  are  being  recycled
or  collected  for  recycling  right  now,  we  estimate  that  50  to  80  per-
cent are being exported for processing in developing countries, and
what  this  looks  like  is,  some  of  the  most  primitive  processing  you
can imagine. There is video of this that I highly recommend if peo-
ple have time to look at it, but what we know is that the products
are  being  taken  apart  with  hammers  and  that  they  are  being
burned.  They  burn  the  plastics  in  order  to  get  the  metals,  which
have  value,  and  when  they  burn  the  plastics,  it  is  creating  dioxin
clouds  which  are  affecting  the  children  in  these  communities
throughout the developing world. This is happening in China. It is
happening in Asia. It is happening in Africa. This is one of the big-
gest problems that we are facing right now and I think the United
States is primarily responsible for this.

So what can Congress do? We do support strong producer respon-
sibility.  We  have  been  working  with  State  legislatures  around  the
country.  There  are  now  almost  a  dozen  states  that  have  passed
laws.  Most  of  them  are  producer  responsibility.  We  do  think  that
we  need  to  close  the  door  on  exporting  the  hazardous  e-waste  to
poor  countries  and  we  do  need  to  promote  a  comprehensive  green
design initiative. Producer responsibility means electronic manufac-
turers  should  bear  the  responsibility  throughout  the  product  life
cycle.  This  is  a  design  initiative  that  started  in  Europe  which  has
now spread around the world and we are working actively to bring
it into the United States. We think that the legislation needs to in-
clude  strong  goals  and  timetables  that  drive  increases  in  recycling
and we support federal legislation but only if it is strong legislation
and  not  lower  than  what  is  already  happening  in  the  states  and
certainly  we  don’t  want  to  see  a  situation  where  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment  would  pass  legislation,  preempt  the  states  and  have  a
lower standard than what is already happening out there.

But  primarily  we  think  that  the  role  of  the  Federal  Government
can  focus  on  two  things:  it  is  preventing  the  export  of  the  haz-
ardous  waste  because  the  states  cannot  address  that.  We  know
that  there  are  good  processing  options  that  do  exist  in  the  United
States and other developed countries and we think that we do need
to  ban  the  export  of  the  toxic  e-waste  so  that  we  can  prevent  the
harm that we know is going on.

But  the  other  major  initiative  that  I  would  like  to  talk  to  you
today about is what we think that the Federal Government can do
to  encourage  green  design  and  green  engineering.  E-waste  would

not  be  an  issue  if  the  products  themselves  were  not  so  toxic,  and
industry’s  efforts  to  green  their  products  are  increasing  but  we
think  still  inadequate  compared  to  rapid  pace  of  the  design
changes.  The  manufacturers  can  design  electronic  products  using
green  chemistry  and  green  engineering  principles  to  make  their
products  more  durable,  more  upgradeable,  to  be  carbon  neutral,
fully  recyclable  and  requiring  fewer  unsustainable  materials.  We
think  that  a  national  sustainable  electronics  initiative  is  the  way
to go where we can combine some of the best thinking in the coun-
try  from  within  industry,  within  academia,  within  government
agencies, public health and environmental organizations to develop
the  new  strategies,  not  only  to  address  the  problems  of  electronic
waste  but  also  to  really  try  to  solve  these  problems  at  the  front
end,  which  we  do  think  is  the  place  where  we  need  to  do  it,  and
we  think  that  the  new  initiative  could  be  composed  of  a  national
clean  electronics  council,  which  would  be  a  governing  body,  again
a multi-stakeholder body, as well as a national clean electronics re-
search  and  development  fund  funded  by  Congress.  We  think  that
the appropriate role could be to assess the current and future envi-
ronmental  and  human  health  impacts,  develop  strategic  plans  to
identify  priority  research  needs,  funding  public  and  private  re-
search  institutions,  and  to  assure  the  diffusion  and  adoption  of
safer and cleaner technologies.

Thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF TED SMITH

E–WASTE: The Exploding Global Electronic Waste Crisis

and Why Green Design Is the Solution

Introduction

I am Ted Smith, the Chair of the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, a national coali-
tion  of  organizations  promoting  green  design  and  responsible  recycling  in  the  elec-
tronics industry. I was also the Executive Director of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coali-
tion, an organization I founded 25 years ago.

The  Electronics  TakeBack  Coalition  appreciates  the  opportunity  to  speak  to  the

Committee today on this important issue of electronic waste.
What’s the problem we need to solve?

• The  electronics  we  buy  don’t  last  very  long,  and  we  are  buying  them  at  in-
creasing rates. Shorter product lifespans, coupled with explosive sales in con-
sumer  electronics,  mean  that  more  products  are  being  disposed  of,  and  dis-
carded computers, TVs, and other consumer electronics (so-called e-waste) are
now the fastest growing waste stream in the U.S.

• Electronic  products  contain  many  toxic  materials  because  they  are  not  de-
signed properly. E-waste contains toxic materials harmful to humans and our
environment.  Over  1,000  materials, 
solvents,
brominated flame retardants, PVC, heavy metals, plastics and gases, are used
to make electronic products and their components.

chlorinated 

• Most  e-waste  is  thrown  in  the  trash—only  a  small  amount,  around  15  per-
cent, is collected for ‘‘recycling.’’ It’s legal in most states to put e-waste in the
trash.

• Most  ‘‘recyclers’’  actually  export  the  products  they  collect  to  developing  coun-
tries  with  no  worker  safety  or  environmental  protections.  There  the  products
are  dismantled  and  separated  using  such  primitive  and  toxic  technologies
that  workers  and  communities  are  exposed  to  many  highly  toxic  chemicals.
Consumers have no way to know if the recycler at their city’s Earth Day col-

including

lection event is really going to recycle their old product, or load it in the con-
tainer and ship it to China.

• Toxic components and poor design make e-waste hard to recycle.

The whole problem is made worse by the fast approaching 2009 digital conversion
of  television  signal,  which  we  see  as  the  largest  government  mandated  planned  ob-
solescence in history.

[For  more  details  on  these  aspects  of  the  problem,  please  see  the  E-Waste  Briefing

book, in the Attachments.]
How do we solve the problem?
1. Establish Producer Responsibility for electronic products at the ‘‘end-of-

life.’’
The first step in solving the problem is to mandate producer responsibility—some-
thing  that  is  already  happening  in  State  legislation.  We  need  the  manufacturers  to
be  responsible  for  taking  back  and  recycling  their  products  when  we  are  done  with
them. We believe that if they have financial responsibility for their products at dis-
posal  time,  then  they  will  have  an  incentive  to  design  them  to  be  more  recyclable.
While  the  cost  of  recycling  is  passed  on  to  the  consumers,  the  cost  is  internalized
into  the  price  (not  added  as  a  visible  fee),  which  rewards  the  companies  who  have
designed  their  products  to  be  more  recyclable.  Since  their  better-designed  products
will  cost  less  to  recycle,  they  can  add  a  lower  amount  to  their  price  to  cover  the
recycling.

We  support  strong  producer  responsibility  legislation,  that  includes  goals  and
timetables that act to drive the companies to do more recycling than they are doing
with  voluntary  programs.  Some  companies  do  have  voluntary  take-back  programs,
but except for Sony, none of the television companies—the ones selling over 30 mil-
lion TVs each year in this country—have a national take-back program. In fact, they
have  been  lobbying  against  legislation  to  require  them  to  take-back  their  products.
And  for  the  companies  that  do  have  programs,  the  volumes  are  not  significant
enough  to  solve  this  problem.  Dell  and  HP’s  take-back  programs  only  take-back
about 10–15 percent of what they sold seven years ago. This is why we need legisla-
tion that actually drives them to do take-back in a way that keeps up with the vol-
ume of products they are selling.

‘‘Individual  producer  responsibility  encourages  competition  between  companies
on how to manage the end-of-life phase of their products. This in turn drives in-
novation, such as in business models, take-back logistics and design changes, to
reduce  the  environmental  impact  of  products  at  the  end  of  their  life.’’  [Joint
Statement by a group of electronics companies and NGOs on Producer Responsi-
bility for Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, March 2, 2007.]

2. Close the door on exporting toxic e-waste to poor countries.

While the states are passing take-back legislation, these laws can’t legally restrict
exports.  Sadly,  it’s  perfectly  legal  to  export  toxic  waste  from  the  U.S.  to  developing
countries,  even  though  it  violates  the  laws  of  most  of  the  countries  where  e-waste
ends up. We are currently solving our e-waste problem by dumping it in poor coun-
tries. And while you will hear from the recycling industry that we shouldn’t prevent
export  of  toxic  electronic  products  or  components  as  long  as  they  have  ‘‘commodity
value,’’  we  believe  that  if  it’s  toxic,  it’s  toxic—whether  it  has  value  or  not—and  it
should be controlled to be sure that it isn’t poisoning people elsewhere in the world.
It’s not that we oppose exporting altogether—it’s fine to export once you have actu-
ally  removed  the  toxics  from  the  materials.  But  that’s  not  what’s  currently  hap-
pening. (Instead, the EPA is just removing these toxic materials from the definition
of ‘‘hazardous waste.’’)

So we need the Federal Government to act to close the door on this export of toxic
e-waste  to  poor  countries.  Since  there  are  many  processing  options  for  these  mate-
rials  in  the  developed  world,  Congress  could  solve  the  problem  by  banning  the  ex-
port  of  these  toxic  materials  to  developing  countries.  This  would  have  the  added
benefit of creating more jobs in this country.
3. Promote Green Design and Green Engineering

Producer  responsibility  helps  support  redesign  of  electronics.  But  we  need  some
other  significant  efforts  that  will  result  in  a  wholesale  change  in  the  way  the  elec-
tronics  industry  thinks  about  design.  Currently,  many  companies  claim  to  have
‘‘green products’’ when they have only done two things: reduced the products’ energy
consumption  and  complied  with  the  chemical  reductions  mandated  by  the  EU.  But
what I am talking about is a much broader scale of green design.

We  want  to  see  this  industry  think  about  the  whole  life  cycle  of  their  products
when  they  design  them—a  concept  known  as  Green  Engineering.  They  shouldn’t
just  consider  the  product’s  use  as  a  product—but  also  the  impacts  from  production
(including resource acquisition) and disposal of the product. Working from two very
good  lists  developed  by  engineers  of  what  comprises  ‘‘green  engineering,’’  we  think
it adds up to having the industry do the following:

• Fully assess and minimize the potential environmental, human health
and social impact of the product’s production, use and end-of-life treatment,
including commonly used recycling and disposal technologies (like shredding).
• Don’t  use  customers  as  the  testing  ground  for  whether  materials  in
the  product  are  safe  or  dangerous.  Ensure  that  all  material  used  and  or
released are as benign and inherently safe as possible BEFORE putting prod-
ucts  on  the  market,  by  applying  a  precautionary  approach  to  chemical  man-
agement and by finding safer substitutes for chemicals that persist and accu-
mulate in the environment.

• Design  for  carbon  neutrality  when  possible  to  reduce  the  energy  impact

of the product throughout its life cycle.

• Maximize design for reparability, reuse and durable use to increase the
longevity  of  the  product  and  thereby  reduce  consumption  of  limited  material
resources.

• Plan  for  recyclability  and  ease  of  disassembly  of  the  product,  including
using materials that can be recycled easily into new products, and minimizing
waste.

• Minimize use of raw virgin materials, and maximize use of recycled mate-

rials, to reduce consumption of limited natural resources.

• Invest in solutions that go beyond our current dominant technologies

to improve, innovate and invent technologies that achieve sustainability.

• Actively  engage  communities  and  stakeholders  in  the  development  of
new design solutions that improve the life cycle impact of electronic products.

Focus on Safe Materials

U.S. based high-tech companies know pretty well what materials they do not want
to  use  in  their  products  based  on  their  toxicity  and  overall  impact  on  the  environ-
ment.  But  they  are  not  so  sure  about  what  they  do  want  to  use.  Companies  have
recently  had  to  phase  out  the  use  of  those  materials  that  are  now  being  regulated
in  Europe  and  Asia  through  laws  such  as  the  Restrictions  on  Hazardous  Materials
(RoHS).  Likewise,  the  EU’s  REACH  legislation  will  have  an  enormous  impact  on
chemical use by the electronics industry, since it will cover as many as 1,800 chemi-
cals  that  are  classified  as  Persistent  Bioaccumulative  Toxics  or  as  carcinogens,
mutagens or reproductive toxins.

Since  most  global  companies  based  in  the  U.S.  no  longer  do  their  own  research
and development—especially on environmental design—there is a real need and de-
mand  for  better  environmental  assessment  tools  that  are  comprehensive,  objective
and credible for all stakeholders. Currently, the U.S. EPA does not certify chemicals
as  ‘‘safe’’  or  ‘‘green’’—they  will  sometimes  provide  data,  but  they  have  been  unable
to evaluate and assess the data to reach conclusions about which chemicals or mate-
rials  are  safer  and  preferable  to  others.  Further,  the  system  they  use  to  approach
these concerns is based on risk rather than hazard, which is less helpful in the real
world.  This  is  the  approach  that  EPA’s  Design  for  the  Environment  program  has
adopted.

Currently,  federal  policy  is  rudderless—not  just  for  electronics  but  for  many  in-
dustries that rely on the use of hazardous materials—and too often companies sim-
ply  don’t  know  how  to  address  the  many  trade-offs  inherent  in  materials  selection.
They  don’t  know  how  to  evaluate  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  new  materials
based on the trade-offs between reproductive toxicity and global warming potential,
as  just  one  example.  There  is  a  new  tool,  called  the  ‘‘Green  Screen’’1 that  can  be
used  to  help  to  fill  this  gap.  It  provides  a  transparent  way  to  ‘‘grade’’  chemicals
based  on  actual  hazard  (not  risk)  and  tells  you  which  ones  are  ‘‘better’’  to  use  and
which  ones  are  ‘‘worse.’’  We  think  it  would  be  helpful  to  U.S.  industry,  particularly
in  sectors  that  have  a  toxic  and  energy  intensive  footprint.  But  it’s  a  methodology,
and there needs to be sufficient funding and institutional resources to apply this ap-

U.S.  Falling  Behind.  The  basic  university  research  at  industry  labs  and  within
universities  is  simply  not  keeping  pace  with  global  developments.  Some  of  the  best
‘‘green  chemists’’  in  the  country—such  as  John  Warner  at  University  of  Massachu-
setts,  Lowell—are  very  concerned  that  most  of  his  graduate  students  come  from
other  countries,  since  U.S.  high  schools  and  colleges  and  not  preparing  enough
chemists  domestically  who  want  to  help  meet  these  challenges.  At  the  same  time,
the  green  chemistry  revolution  is  expanding  vigorously  in  other  countries,  such  as
China  and  India.  I  was  in  China  last  year  on  a  university  speaking  tour,  and  met
many  enthusiastic  and  bright  students  who  are  very  excited  about  using  the  tools
of  green  chemistry  to  help  solve  the  critical  problems  of  environmental  design.  But
in the U.S., we are falling further and further behind.

What Can Congress do to help promote Green Design and Green Engineer-

ing?

Industry is simply not developing a sufficient green design agenda on its own. The
structure  of  this  industry,  where  most  of  the  production  is  done  by  various  sub-
contractors around the world—not by the companies themselves—acts as a disincen-
tive  for  R&D  on  green  design.  Therefore,  we  believe  that  Congress  can  help  by  es-
tablishing  and  funding  a  National  Sustainable  Electronics  Initiative  (NSEI),  that
brings  together  members  of  industry,  academia,  government  agencies,  and  public
health  and  environmental  organizations,  to  insure  the  rapid  development  of  elec-
tronic  products  that  embrace  the  Green  Engineering  principles—that  are  cleaner,
safer and more sustainable throughout their life cycle. This initiative would be com-
posed  of  a  National  Clean  Electronics  Council  (a  governing  body)  and  a  National
Clean Electronics Research and Development Fund (funded by Congress.)

The National Sustainable Electronics Initiative should develop strategies to:

1) Minimize  their  environmental  and  public  health  impacts  on  workers,  con-
sumers  and  communities  from  manufacture  through  use  and  final  disposal
or recycling. This includes but is not limited to:
a) reducing the toxicity and volume of packaging
b) minimizing product shipping throughout its life cycle, from raw material

extraction through disposal

c) reducing or eliminating toxic materials in product manufacture
d) effective  and  enforceable  environmental  standards  to  assure  that  toxic
electronic  waste  will  be  properly  managed  in  strict  compliance  with
international  and  domestic  laws,  including  the  laws  of  importing  and
transit  countries,  that  govern  export  of  hazardous  electronic  waste,
worker  safety,  public  health  and  environmental  protection,  and  the  use
of market labor rather than incarcerated labor;

2) Be taken back at the end-of-life by manufacturers
3) Be  designed

including  maximizing

4) Be  designed  to  minimize  material  use  per  functional  unit  (de-materializa-

tion)

5) Minimize energy use/ maximize energy efficiency
6) Fully  assess  the  environmental  and  public  health  impacts  of  new  materials
and technologies prior to use and/or market release (e.g., new chemical com-
ponents, nanomaterials, bio-plastics, etc.)

7) Minimize energy use/maximize energy efficiency
8) Fully  assess  the  environmental  and  public  health  impacts  of  new  materials
and technologies prior to use and/or market release (e.g., new chemical com-
ponents, nanomaterials, bio-plastics, etc.)

The  NSEI  would  promote  a  full-life  cycle  assessment  approach  for  the  electronics
industry,  with  continuous  improvement  goals  to  be  set  by  the  National  Sustainable
Electronics  Council  in  consultation  with  a  National  Sustainable  Electronics  Re-
search and Development Fund.

The Council, which would be comprised of representatives of the electronics indus-
try companies, environmental and public health organizations, and national govern-
ment agencies, would be responsible for:

• assessing  the  current  and  potential  future  environmental  and  human  health

impacts of consumer electronics

• developing  a  strategic  plan  for  the  reduction  and  minimization  of  all  detri-
mental impacts, including the identification of current barriers and opportuni-
ties,  the  identification  of  priority  research  needs,  and  the  setting  of  Strategic
Program Goals for the industry,
• awarding funding on a competitive basis to universities, corporations, private
research  institutions  and  national  laboratories,  for  addressing  priority  re-
search  needs,  for  eliminating  current  barriers,  and  for  developing  safer  and
cleaner technologies,

• assuring the diffusion and adoption of safer and cleaner technologies,
• assessing the effectiveness of the implementation of the strategic plan,
• reporting on a bi-annual basis on the performance of the industry in meeting
• managing the Research and Development Fund

the Strategic Program Goals, and

4. Promote Tools For Consumers to Select Green Electronics

Consumers  always  ask  us  what  electronic  products  are  environmentally  pref-
erable.  Who  makes  a  ‘‘green  TV?’’  Which  laptop  is  greener?  The  primary  tool  avail-
able  for  this  purpose  is  the  fairly  new  EPEAT  tool—the  Electronic  Products  Envi-
ronmental  Assessment  Tool.  It’s  like  an  Energy  star  label,  currently  only  for  busi-
ness computers. We’d like to see this expanded to other electronics products, includ-
ing  Televisions.  The  EPEAT  board  was  slated  to  develop  standards  for  televisions
next, but has recently decided to postpone this plan. We think it’s crucial for EPEAT
to  address  televisions  as  its  next  target,  since  we  are  buying  so  many  televisions,
and because there is so much new technology coming out in televisions very quickly.
We would like to see Congress provide enough funding to EPEAT to make sure the
standards  development  process  moves  forward,  plus  we  would  like  to  see  enough
money to allow them to market the EPEAT program in a way that makes it a viable
tool for consumers, not just institutional purchasers.

INTRODUCTION

Concerns  regarding  population  growth,  global  warming,  resource  scarcity,
globalization,  and  environmental  degradation  have  led  to  an  increasing  awareness
that current engineering design can be engaged more effectively to advance the goal
of  sustainability  and  that  there  will  need  to  be  a  new  design  framework  that  con-
sciously  incorporates  sustainability  factors  as  performance  criteria.  Sustainability
has been defined as ‘‘meeting the needs of the current generation without impacting
the  needs  of  future  generations  to  meet  their  own  needs’’  and  is  often  interpreted
as  mutually  advancing  the  goals  of  prosperity,  environment,  and  society.  The  12
Principles of Green Engineering (Anastas, 2003) are collectively a design protocol for
engineers to utilize in moving towards sustainability.

The  impact  of  population  growth  has  long  been  understood  as  one  of  the  grand
challenges  to  mutually  advancing  these  goals  and  creating  a  sustainable  future.
When the issue is examined more closely, the data demonstrate that the vast major-
ity  of  population  growth  is  occurring  in  the  developing  world  while  population  is
stagnant,  and  in  some  cases  declining,  in  the  industrialized  world  (Figure  1).  This
may suggest that within the complex equation of growing population including birth
and  mortality  rates,  socio-political  pressures,  access  to  health  care  and  education,
cultural norms, etc., there is an empirical correlation between the rate of population
growth and level of economic development, often equated with quality of life.

This relationship suggests that one approach to be seriously considered in meeting
the  challenges  of  stabilizing  population  growth  and  advancing  the  goal  of  sustain-
ability is through expanded economic development and improved quality of life. His-
torically,  however,  increases  in  development  and  quality  of  life  have  been  inex-
tricable  linked  with  environmental  degradation  and  resource  depletion.  There  is  a
significant  amount  of  evidence  that  suggests  that  conventionally  an  increasing
human  population  has  put  an  increasing  strain  on  natural  resources  used  for  con-
sumption  and  waste  assimilation.  While  there  is  no  single  satisfactory  index  of  the
state of the environment, the relationship between population and environment can
be  analyzed  in  terms  of  resource  depletion  or  dimensions  of  environmental  quality
such as land use, water quantity and quality, pollution generation particularly from
increased  energy  demand,  bio-diversity,  and  climate  change.  A  brief  review  of  each
of  these  indicators  supports  the  notion  that,  traditionally,  population  growth  has
had a detrimental impact on the environment.

Therefore,  the  question  is  how  to  bring  about  continued  development  and  en-
hanced quality of life in both the developing and developed world without the histor-
ical  environmental  degradation  and  resource  consumption.  Green  Engineering,
along with Green Chemistry (Anastas, 1998), are engaged through science and tech-
nology on ensuring that quality of life, or state of economic development, is increas-
ing  through  benign  chemicals  and  materials  and  life  cycle-based  design  as  well  as
material  and  energy  efficiency  and  effectiveness.  This  decouples  the  historical  rela-
tionship  of  population  growth  and  environmental  degradation  on  the  path  towards
an improved quality of life. The 12 Principles of Green Engineering (Anastas, 2003)
(see  Table  1)  provide  a  framework  for  scientists  and  engineers  to  engage  in  when
designing  new  materials,  products,  processes,  and  systems  that  are  benign  to
human health and the environment.
THE 12 PRINCIPLES OF GREEN ENGINEERING

A  design  based  on  the  12  Principles  moves  beyond  baseline  engineering  quality
and  safety  specifications  to  consider  sustainability  factors  and  allow  designers  to
consider  them  as  fundamental  factors  at  the  earliest  stages  as  they  are  designing
a  material,  product,  process,  building  or  a  system.  These  Principles  were  developed
to  engage  in  design  architecture—whether  it  is  the  molecular  architecture  required
to  construct  chemical  compounds,  product  architecture  to  create  an  automobile,  or
urban architecture to build a city, the Principles are applicable, effective, and appro-

priate. If not, the value of these design principles diminishes as their usefulness be-
comes  dependent  on  local  parameters  and  system  conditions  and  they  cannot  effec-
tively function as global design principles.
The 12 Principles of Green Engineering (Anastas, 2003).
PRINCIPLE 1—Designers need to strive to ensure that all material and energy in-
puts and outputs are as inherently non-hazardous as possible.
PRINCIPLE 2—It  is  better  to  prevent  waste  than  to  treat  or  clean  up  waste  after
it is formed.
PRINCIPLE  3—Separation  and  purification  operations  should  be  a  component  of
the design framework.
PRINCIPLE 4—System  components  should  be  designed  to  maximize  mass,  energy
and temporal efficiency.
PRINCIPLE  5—System  components  should  be  output  pulled  rather  than  input
pushed through the use of energy and materials.
PRINCIPLE  6—Embedded  entropy  and  complexity  must  be  viewed  as  an  invest-
ment when making design choices on recycle, reuse or beneficial disposition.
PRINCIPLE 7—Targeted durability, not immortality, should be a design goal.
PRINCIPLE 8—Design for unnecessary capacity or capability should be considered
a design flaw. This includes engineering ‘‘one size fits all’’ solutions.
PRINCIPLE 9—Multi-component products should strive for material unification to
promote disassembly and value retention. (minimize material diversity).
PRINCIPLE  10—Design  of  processes  and  systems  must  include  integration  of
interconnectivity with available energy and materials flows.
PRINCIPLE  11—Performance  metrics  include  designing  for  performance  in  com-
mercial ‘‘after-life.’’
PRINCIPLE  12—Design  should  be  based  on  renewable  and  readily  available  in-
puts throughout the life cycle.

ADVANCING GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY

Science and technology will play a fundamental and vital role in advancing global
sustainability by engaging in next generation design of fundamental products, proc-
esses,  and  systems  necessary  for  maintaining  and  enhancing  quality  of  life  while
protecting  the  planet.  For  global  sustainability  to  be  advanced  the  current  oper-
ational  model  of  unilateral  knowledge  transfer  from  the  industrialized  world  to  the
developing  world  could  be  expanded  to  include  knowledge  exchange.  The  exchange
would allow for learning about indigenous knowledge and traditional design, poten-
tially  simple  and  elegant,  which  has  developed  and  adapted  for  local  people  and
place. This would provide an opportunity to integrate the best and most appropriate
knowledge,  methodologies,  techniques,  and  practices  from  both  the  developed  and
developing  worlds  in  terms  of  designing  for  sustainability.  The  examples  of  innova-
tions  in  science  and  technology  from  the  developing  world  highlight  alternative
strategies  to  deliver  services  such  as  clean  drinking  water,  medical  treatment,  en-
ergy and power production, material and product development, building technologies
and techniques.
CONCLUSIONS

The achievements that have been obtained using green engineering principles are
exceptional  examples  of  design  with  a  new  sustainability  perspective.  If  the  chal-
lenges of sustainability are going to be addressed both within the currently industri-
alized  nations  as  well  as  those  developing  nations  whose  path  to  development  will
be  most  consequential  for  the  environment  and  society,  it  will  be  essential  that
these new design imperatives be incorporated systematically in the next generation
of  products,  processes,  and  systems.  Within  this  context,  the  technological  dialogue
that  takes  place  between  the  developed  and  developing  world  must  be  able  to  con-
sider  and  utilize  both  a  high  level  understanding  of  complex  systems  as  well  as  an
incorporation of simple elegance found in millennia of experience and tradition. The
sources  of  technological  inspiration  will  likely  need  to  be  broad  and  diverse  if  we
are to design the products and systems of tomorrow to be sufficiently improved and
more sustainable than those of today.

Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Smith.
Mr. Williams, you are recognized.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  MICHAEL  T.  WILLIAMS,  EXECUTIVE  VICE
PRESIDENT  AND  GENERAL  COUNSEL,  SONY  ELECTRONICS
INC.
Mr.  MICHAEL WILLIAMS.  Chairman  Gordon,  Ranking  Member
Hall  and  distinguished  Members  of  the  Committee,  on  behalf  of
Sony  Electronics  and  its  employees,  I  would  like  to  thank  you  for
providing us this opportunity to testify about Sony’s environmental
stewardship program.

Sony  has  long  been  an  industry  leader  in  the  design  and  manu-
facture of environmentally friendly information technology and con-
sumer  electronic  products.  Sony  has  now  made  an  even  a  stronger
commitment  to  the  environment  when  last  September  Sony
launched the first national comprehensive electronics recycling ini-
tiative  in  the  United  States.  Our  program  provides  customers  free
recycling  of  any  of  their  unwanted  Sony  products  from  a  Trinitron
television  to  a  PlayStation  to  even  a  Sony  Ericsson  mobile  cell
phone. Under our program, Sony takes full manufacturer responsi-
bility for all products that bear the Sony name and we will recycle
Sony  products  at  no  cost  to  the  consumer,  or,  the  way  I  explained
it to my 83-year-old mother, if we make it, we take it.

To carry out our nationwide take-back program, Sony contracted
with  Waste  Management  to  establish  138  drop-off  locations
throughout  the  country.  Our  goal  is  to  have  150  drop-off  locations
with at least one recycling center in each state by September. Our
long-term goal is to have a collection location within 20 miles of 95
percent of the United States population. In addition to establishing
these  permanent  locations,  we  also  work  with  our  local  retailers
and local municipalities to have recycling events. We have planned
50 of those events this year. Since last September, our program has
collected  almost  seven  million  pounds  of  consumer  electronic  prod-
ucts.  Our  five-year  goal  is  to  collect  600  million  pounds.  In  sum-
mary, Sony has set a goal for itself to collect one pound of recycled
product for every pound that we sell. Sony wants to make the recy-
cling  of  our  products  as  easy  for  consumers  as  it  is  purchasing
them.

Mr.  Chairman,  we  believe  this  is  a  path  to  sustainability.  But
our environmental work at Sony doesn’t stop at collection. All Sony
products  collected  must  be  recycled  using  the  strictest  environ-
mental  standards.  We  seek  at  least  95  percent  recycling  rates.  In
addition,  we  provide  full  public  accountability  of  where  and  how
our waste material is disposed. We seek to reuse as much material
as  possible  and  we  prohibit  the  exportation  of  hazardous  waste  to
developing countries.

But  Sony’s  environmental  efforts  are  also  forward  looking  as
well. We continue to introduce a variety of environmentally friend-
ly  electronic  products,  and  today  I  brought  along  two  examples—
the  Sony  e-Reader  and  our  OLED  television.  Now,  the  Sony  e-
Reader,  Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Member  Hall  and  Members,  is  a
unique on-the-go reading experience. This little book, this little tab-
let  can  hold  up  to  160  novels,  and  with  its  rechargeable  battery,
you  can  have  7,500  page  turns,  and  if  you  are  like  me,  sometimes
I  forget  to  bring  my  reading  glasses,  you  can  even  press  a  button
and  it  changes  the  size  of  the  font.  But  just  think  of  how  much
paper, how much energy is saved with an e-Reader product.

I  have  also  brought  along  our  OLED  television.  This  stands  for
organic  light-emitting  diode.  It  is  only  three  millimeters  thick,  or
I should say three millimeters thin. It represents the latest in Sony
display technology, and it is also exceptionally energy efficient. The
OLED  technology  can  result  in  reduced  power  consumption  of  up
to  40  percent  per  square  panel  inch,  and  because  we  use  organic
polymers in this display, it does not have any mercury or lead.

Mr.  Chairman,  these  are  just  two  products  that  Sony  is  doing
today. Coupled with our stewardship program, our full producer re-
sponsibility  take-back  program,  we  believe  this  is  the  path  that
companies should take.

Thank  you  again  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  before  this  com-
mittee,  and  Sony  looks  forward  to  working  with  you  in  developing
a successful national e-waste program.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Williams follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL T. WILLIAMS

On  behalf  of  Sony  Electronics  Inc.  and  our  employees  throughout  the  country,  I
would like to thank the Committee for the opportunity to testify about Sony’s envi-
ronmental stewardship program.
Sony’s National E-Cycling Program

Sony  has  long  been  an  industry  leader  in  the  environmentally-friendly  design  of
our  consumer  electronics  and  information  technology  products.  Sony  has  now  made
an  even  stronger  commitment  to  environmental  stewardship.  Last  year,  we  an-
nounced a ground-breaking program to encourage consumers to recycle and dispose
of electronic devices in an environmentally sound manner.

Sony teamed up with Waste Management, Inc. to implement the first national re-
cycling  initiative  in  the  U.S.  to  involve  both  a  major  electronics  manufacturer  and
a national waste management company.

Our  program  provides  customers  free  recycling  of  any  of  their  unwanted  Sony
products, including Playstation consoles and Sony Ericsson phones. Under this pro-
gram,  Sony  takes  full  manufacturer  responsibility  for  all  products  that  bear  the
Sony brand. We will recycle those products at no cost to the consumer. This not only
includes consumer products, but business and professional products as well.

While Sony will recycle its own products for free, our recycling locations will also

accept non-Sony consumer electronics and information technology products.

To  fully  carry  out  this  nationwide  e-waste  take-back  program,  Sony  and  Waste
Management  Recycle  America  utilize  138  drop-off  centers  throughout  the  country.
This  is  an  increase  from  the  initial  75.  In  addition  to  setting  up  permanent  collec-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:58 Aug 25, 2008 Jkt 041901 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\043008\41901 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

52

tion  centers,  we  are  also  holding  recycling  events,  coordinating  with  retailers  and
local municipalities. By the end of this year, we plan to have held at least 50 special
recycling events.

Our  goal  is  to  have  150  drop-off  locations  throughout  the  United  States,  with  at
least one recycling location in every state by September 2008. Our longer term goal
is  to  have  a  collection  location  within  20  miles  of  95  percent  of  the  United  States
population  at  which  consumers,  retailers,  and  municipalities  can  have  any  product
from any consumer electronic manufacturer recycled.

Sony  has  set  a  goal  to  recycle  one  pound  of  consumer  electronics  goods  for  every

pound sold. This is sustainability.

Since its inception last September, our program has collected almost seven million
pounds of consumer electronics products. Our five-year goal is to raise that number
to 600 million pounds per year.

In  summary,  Sony  wants  to  make  the  recycling  of  our  products  as  easy  for  con-

sumers as the purchasing of products.
Other Sony Recycling Programs

Beyond the program described above, in an effort to encourage customers to recy-
cle, Sony offers customers Sony credit toward the future purchase of a similar prod-
uct if they send in their old product for recycling. This ‘‘trade-up’’ program is applied
to 
laptops,  digital  cameras  and  camcorders.  By  going  on  to  our  website,
www.sonystyle.com, customers can enter specific values describing their old product.
Once  the  appropriate  value  is  determined,  customers  will  receive  an  e-coupon  valid
at our Sony Style website toward the purchase of a new product. Depending on the
product, values can range up to $1,000.00.
Product Recycling

After  products  are  collected  through  the  Sony  Take  Back  and  Recycle  program,
Waste  Management  will  store,  track  inventory  and  dismantle  the  products  into  the
form  of  common  raw  materials  where  they  can  be  bought  and  sold  on  the  global
market.  In  some  cases,  it  is  likely  that  recycled  plastics  will  be  purchased  for  re-
forming into a new current model electronic product.

All  products  which  are  collected  through  the  Sony  Take  Back  and  Recycle  pro-
gram must be recycled using the strictest and highest environmental standards. We
seek  at  least  95  percent  recycling  rates,  with  less  than  five  percent  of  materials
going  to  landfills.  In  addition,  we  provide  full  public  accountability  of  how  and
where  the  material  goes.  We  seek  to  reuse  as  much  as  possible  in  new  Sony  prod-
ucts.  Most  importantly,  we  prohibit  the  exportation  of  hazardous  waste  to  devel-
oping countries.
Product Innovation

Sony  has  long  been  an  industry  leader  in  product  innovation.  And  we  are  con-
tinuing to add an array of environmentally-friendly electronic products, such as our
e-Reader.

The  Reader  Digital  Book  offers  a  unique,  on-the-go  reading  experience.  With  a
compact  and  lightweight  design,  it  holds  up  to  160  e-Books.  You  can  easily  hold  it
in one hand, and with its rechargeable battery, you can turn up to 7,500 continuous
pages on a single charge.

Today,  I  have  brought  with  me  an  example  of  Sony’s  latest  product  innovation,
our  new  OLED  television.  OLED  (or  Organic  Light  Emitting  Diode)  is  a  revolu-
tionary Sony display technology that offers exceptional picture quality and color re-
production  from  a  screen  that  is  a  mere  3mm  thick.  Unlike  liquid  crystal  display
(LCD)  televisions,  the  Sony  OLED  TV  does  not  utilize  a  backlight.  In  LCD  TVs,  a
backlight must remain ‘‘always on’’ for video display. Rather, each OLED pixel pro-
duces its own light and is off, using no power, when displaying blacks.

While  this  OLED  technology  offers  exceptional  contrast  ratios  and  outstanding
dark scene detail, it also leads to improved power performance. Under normal view-
ing conditions, the OLED technology can result in reduced power consumption of up
to  40  percent  per  panel  square  inch.  As  with  all  Sony  BRAVIA  LCD  HDTVs,  the
OLED displays do not incorporate any lead content, and, with no backlight needed,
offer no mercury content as well.

Sony  hopes  to  utilize  this  technology  for  other  future  products,  such  as  laptops,

cell phones and larger size televisions.
Sony’s Comments on Federal Legislation

Sony urges you to adopt legislation that supports our efforts and extends the envi-
ronmental  stewardship  we  have  demonstrated  to  all  electronics  manufacturers  and
retailers.  While  we  are  confident  that  Sony’s  voluntary  e-waste  recycling  program
will make great strides forward, only a truly comprehensive and consistent program

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:58 Aug 25, 2008 Jkt 041901 PO 00000 Frm 00056 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\043008\41901 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

53

will  allow  all  interested  parties  to  achieve  our  shared  recycling  goals.  Sony,  there-
fore, respectfully requests that any legislation reflect the following:

• Preemption

Although  it  is  of  course  a  significant  event  when  Congress  preempts  State
regulation on a particular point, Sony believes that electronics recycling is an
issue  on  which  State  preemption  is  essential.  We  and  other  stakeholders  al-
ready have to comply with numerous, and sometimes contradictory, State and
local e-waste laws. The inconsistency between these programs inevitably cre-
ates  inefficiencies  in  the  system  and  minimizes  any  economies  of  scale  that
could  be  achieved.  And  since  Sony  (and  likely  no  other  manufacturer)  does
not build products to be sold in a particular state, adding a federal bill with-
out  State  preemption  merely  adds  more  complexity  rather  than  simplifying
and  streamlining  the  process.  In  the  end,  a  patchwork  quilt  of  different  and
ultimately  contradictory  State  and  municipal  laws  will  only  serve  to  under-
mine  everyone’s  shared  goal  of  recycling  as  much  electronic  waste  as  effi-
ciently and cheaply as possible.

• Producer Responsibility

Sony believes that it is the individual manufacturer’s responsibility to assure
that  any  product  that  bears  its  name  is  properly  recycled  using  the  highest
standards  possible  at  the  end  of  the  product’s  life.  That  said,  other  stake-
holders who directly benefit from the sale or enjoyment of electronic products
must  also  bear  some  responsibility.  More  specifically,  retailers—at  the  very
least—must  take  an  active  role  in  the  collection  of  e-waste  and  consumers
must  be  encouraged  to  take  the  extra  step  necessary  to  properly  dispose  of
their products.
• Market Share

In  order  to  create  a  level  playing  field,  any  manufacturer  obligation
should be based upon present market share and not on historical activi-
ties or waste collected. Systems based upon the amount of waste collected will
give  a  cost  advantage  to  those  companies  that  are  new  to  the  market.  Such
companies  can  avoid  any  recycling  cost  by  simply  staying  in  business  and
changing their brand or company name every year. Many of these ‘‘no name’’
brands  are  made  of  lower  quality  materials,  which  can  contain  higher  levels
of  toxic  chemicals  and  may  be  more  difficult  to  recycle.  Any  mandate  not
based  upon  today’s  market  share  will  give  those  companies  a  ‘‘free  ride’’  on
recycling. This will lower their costs when compared to responsible companies
by  rewarding  manufacturers  who  avoid  their  environmental  obligations  and
penalizing  responsible  companies  by  putting  environmentally-advanced  prod-
ucts at a competitive cost disadvantage.

• Products Covered

Our  recycling  program  covers  all  of  our  branded  products  from  movies  (i.e.,
DVDs),  to  professional  equipment  used  to  project  movies  in  theaters,  to
laptops or televisions used to watch movies at home.
Sony,  therefore,  respectfully  urges  you  to  adopt  one  program  with  one  set  of
requirements  which  will  require  full  producer  responsibility  for  all  products
manufactured. The advancement of technology has enabled manufacturers to
create  an  array  of  products  using  the  same  chemicals  and  metals  that  are
used in the products commonly covered in e-waste recycling mandates. Given
this,  Sony  suggests  adopting  legislation  to  target  all  products  that  contain
these same internal and external components and chemicals.

• Cost

Sony internalizes the cost of recycling and requests that any mandate require
the  same.  Currently,  Sony  pays  to  recycle  our  old  products.  While  there  are
several  financing  mechanisms  that  allow  for  recovery  of  this  cost,  Sony  be-
lieves  that  internalizing  the  cost  is  the  most  effective  and  fair  method  for
funding a comprehensive electronics recycling program. Such funding mecha-
nisms  create  market  incentives  for  manufacturers  to  ex  ante  design  and
produce  the  most  environmentally-friendly  products  possible.  In  addition,  it
encourages  manufacturers  to  develop  and  implement  the  most  efficient  and
cost-effective  recycling  procedures.  Indeed,  it  is  Sony’s  ultimate  goal  through
design  improvements,  the  growth  of  the  recycling  industry,  and  economies  of
scale to drive these recycling costs down, thus making recycling cost effective.
Until  that  time,  Sony  considers  the  cost  of  recycling  as  part  of  the  cost  of
doing business.

forward  to  working  with  you  in  developing  a  successful,  national  e-waste  recycling
program.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Williams.  I  hope  it  will  be
a  few  years,  but  I  have  a  TV  I  am  going  to  bring  back  to  you  one
of these days.

Mr. MICHAEL WILLIAMS. Not a problem, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  GORDON.  At  this  point  we  will  open  the  first  round  of
questions,  and  the  Chair  recognizes  himself  for  five  minutes.  I  am
not  going  to  take  that.  What  I  am  going  to  do  is  ask—and  many
of  you  have  been  responsive  already.  I  am  going  to  submit  ques-
tions  to  you  and  ask  your  suggestions  on  any  type  of  federal  re-
search  that  might  be  beneficial  both  in  the  back  end  of  recycling
or the front end in developing technologies to make it easier to re-
cycle on the back end, and I also will ask you about any other type
of  federal  programs  you  think  could  expedite  this.  Your  testimony
has been very good.

And now I am going to yield the balance of my time to Ms. Rich-

ardson.

Ms. RICHARDSON. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have several
questions  and  I  would  also  like  to—I  think  I  will  only  get  through
a couple, if I could submit the rest into the record.

My first question is, I was very appreciative of Mr. Castro. First
of all, I represent southern California and several of your sites are
in  my  district,  so  welcome  to  Washington.  One  of  our  major  issues
regarding  these  recycling  programs  is  the  cost.  California  is  the
only  state,  as  you  mentioned,  sir,  with  a  consumer  fee  to  pay  for
recycling.  Almost  other  states  have  the  manufacturer  take  the  re-
sponsibility for the recycling cost. Which one of these models would
you recommend would be best, and this question is for both Ms. St.
Denis  and  I  think  Mr.  Williams.  My  question  is  on  the  advanced
recovery fee in California.

Ms.  ST.  DENIS.  Thank  you  for  your  question.  In  our  experience
with the model in California and the models that have been devel-
oped  in  other  states,  we  find  that  where  the  manufacturers  are
more  directly  involved  in  the  recycling  processes,  as  they  are  in
other parts of the world, the systems become more efficient. We are
much more tied to actually doing the recycling ourselves or having
it  done  on  our  behalf.  I  am  sure  Mr.  Smith  would  agree  that  the
more  we  are  involved  in  the  recycling,  the  more  we  are  motivated
to find alternatives to some of the materials of concern that are in
the  products.  The  system  in  California  has  proved  to  be  somewhat
inefficient.  There  is  a  need  for  an  increase  in  the  fees.  That  was
discussed at a meeting earlier this week. And increasing those fees
from a range of $6 to $10 to a range of $10 to $30, and we see that
as,  you  know,  a  burden  on  current  consumers  that  is  really  going
to pay for the waste of former consumers and so we are much more
in  favor  of  the  producer  responsibility  systems  that  we  are  seeing
developed in other states.

Ms.  RICHARDSON.  Well,  Ms.  St.  Denis,  according  to  your  testi-
mony, HP, your recycling rate for 2007 was 15 percent so it sounds
like to me you could use a little help. So wouldn’t you think maybe
a  combination  of  the  two,  maybe  a  fee  that  the  consumer  pays  di-
rectly and then also a portion that you are involved with?

Ms. ST. DENIS. So——
Ms. RICHARDSON. Because 15 percent isn’t satisfactory.
Ms. ST. DENIS. Well, so the 15 percent is predicated on one very
important  factor,  and  that  is  the  behavior  of  the  consumer.  The
California  system  also  does  not  provide  any—neither  system  pro-
vides  direct  incentives  to  the  customers  to  recycle  the  electronics.
So we do recycle everything customers want to give us. Another im-
portant  fact  to  note  is  that  none  of  the  recycling  that  takes  place
in  California  is  counted  in  that  15  percent  number  because  we
don’t do the recycling ourselves; it is handled by State agencies. So
we  can’t  count  that.  The  15  percent  reflects  only  what  we  do  our-
selves, which, again, is what we are seeing in the states that have
legislation emerging. The first of those actually took effect in large
scale  in  Minnesota  this  year,  so  you  will  see  that  number  go  up.
Ms.  RICHARDSON.  Ms.  St.  Denis,  maybe  I  am  not  clear.  What  I
thought  you  said  in  your  answer  to  the  advance  recovery  fee  was
that  it  would  be  better  served  if  you  were  more  engaged  and  in-
volved,  and  then  when  I  referenced  the  area  that  you  are  engaged
and  involved  in,  it  is  only  15  percent  of  what  you  are  saying  your

56

role  of  what  you  are  doing.  So  what  would  you—let  me  ask  it  in
a  different  way.  What  would  you  suggest  as  to  how  we  could  in-
crease  that  number  or  increase  consumer  education  to  assist  you?
Ms.  ST.  DENIS.  So  I  think  one  thing  that  is  important  is  to  edu-
cate  the  consumer  about  the  need  to  recycle  these  products  when
they  are  done  with  them.  We  find  that  they  are  often  stored  for
long  periods  of  time  before  they  enter  into  the  recycling  system,
and when we have events, much like the one that you had here last
weekend, there is overwhelming demand for this service. So people
show  up  with  a  lot  of  things  to  recycle  but  they  often  don’t  know
that  systems  exist.  We  manufacturers  often  advertise  this  fact  as
part  of  our  new  sales  but  there  is  a  lack  of  understanding  in  the
sort  of  the  general  population  that  they  have  a  responsibility  to
start  these  products  on  the  way  to  the  appropriate  recycling  solu-
tion.  There  also  are  states  where  these  products  can  still  be
landfilled  and  so  in  many  cases  those  products  escape  what  we
think of as the kinds of systems that we put in place.

Ms. RICHARDSON. And Mr. Williams, what is your thought on the

advance recovery fee? And I am down to my last minute.

Mr. MICHAEL WILLIAMS. Yes, ma’am. In terms of the advance re-
covery  fee,  in  the  past  we  have  supported  that  but  since  then,  as
you  can  tell  from  my  testimony,  we  believe  in  producer  responsi-
bility. We make it, we will take it back. We will take responsibility
for  the  product.  That  being  said,  the  issue  with  advance  recovery
fees,  is  the  money  being  collected  to  address  legacy  issues,  manu-
facturers  have  gone  out  of  business,  or  the  current  players  in  the
marketplace.  Moreover,  with  advance  recovery  fees,  not  all  State
governments  are  fiscally  responsible.  The  money  may  be  collected
on  the  sale  of  a  television,  but  if  it  goes  into  the  general  fund,  we
don’t  know  where  that  money  is  going  to  be  10  or  15  years  from
now  when  we  may  need  it.  That  is  where  we  think  federal  legisla-
tion  in  this  area  is  essential.  Moreover,  not  only  should  the  pro-
ducer  take  some—take  responsibility,  but  other  stakeholders  have
to  be  involved  to  make  this  successful.  We  need  the  retailers  to  be
involved.  They  have  a  stake  in  this  outcome  as  well  as  consumer
education.

Ms. RICHARDSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Ms.  Richardson.  As  usual,  you
had  very  good  questions,  and  Mr.  Hall  is  recognized  for  five  min-
utes.

Mr. HALL. Because we are only about 10 minutes away from the
joint session, I won’t ask questions but I will yield to Mr. Bartlett,
who I think has some interesting questions involving Dr. Gingrey’s
bill. I yield my time to you, Roscoe.

Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you very much, and thank you all for your
testimony.  As  I  sat  here  thinking  about  what  I  might  say  or  ask
you, I really was in quite a quandary, because what we are dealing
with  is  really  a  self-inflicted  wound,  a  self-inflicted  problem.  We
have recycling problems. We have huge energy costs in making this
equipment  that  we  then  throw  away.  We  have  big  environmental
problems.  Much  of  this  equipment  is  made  with  planned  obsoles-
cence.  You  just  expect  the  people  very  shortly  to  throw  it  away.
You  design  it  to  dispose  of  it.  You  don’t  design  it  so  that  it  can  be

repaired or upgraded, and we behave as if resources are unlimited
like there is unlimited amount of energy.

This morning I noted that in every one of the papers I looked at
in  our  Hill  newspapers,  the  major  headline  on  the  front  page  of
every one of them had to deal with energy and the high cost of gas-
oline, that everybody is being blamed and the person that really is
to  blame  for  this  is  the  millions  of  us  who  are  out  there  riding
around  in  our  SUVs.  The  demand  is  just  greater  than  the  supply.
It  is  simply  a  supply-and-demand  problem  which  is  why  the  price
of gasoline is up. I said this was a self-inflicted problem and it real-
ly is. Much of the equipment, this electronic equipment that is sold
is bought with discretionary money. You just don’t need it. And we
have  to  trade  off  in  our  society  today,  what  is  more  important,  to
spend  more  time  with  these  silly  games  or  to  use  less  energy  so
there  will  be  more  of  it  available  for  our  kids  and  our  grandkids.
Yet we have a huge beast to feed out there. We have this huge in-
dustry  that  is  making  this  stuff,  and  if  you  aren’t  buying  it  and
throwing it away, they aren’t making it.

How do we resolve this problem? What do we do? I have 10 kids,
16  grandkids  and  two  great-grandkids.  We  are  handing  them  a
huge debt, not with my votes, if you will look at my voting record.
Wouldn’t  it  be  nice  if  we  left  them  a  little  energy?  I  am  having  a
big  problem  with  a  society  that  just  wants  to  consume,  profligate
spending,  just  play,  play,  play  with  no  thought  for  tomorrow,  no
thought  for  your  kids,  no  thought  for  your  grandkids,  and  here  we
are  today  talking  about  a  problem  that  is  almost  totally  self-in-
flicted. You know, if you want to—if people need to work, why can’t
they  work  rebuilding  this  equipment  and  repairing  it  rather  than
just  throwing  it  away?  There  is  no  reason,  for  instance,  that—we
don’t have frames on cars anymore. When we used to have a frame,
no  reason  that  that  wouldn’t  last  100  years.  Why  does  it  have  to
go  to  the  junkyard  in  16  or  18  years?  You  know,  these  things  are
not  limitless.  There  is  a  limit  to  the  amount  of  energy  that  is  out
there.  There  is  a  limit  to  the  amount  of  these  metals  and  so  forth
that  are  out  there.  There  is  a  limit  to  the  capacity  of  the  environ-
ment  to  absorb  all  of  these  things.  How  do  we  reach  a  balance  in
this  so  that  we  aren’t  looking  just  to  the  next  election  pandering
to  people  so  we  will  get  elected,  so  that  we  aren’t  looking  just  to
the  next  quarterly  report  so  that  it  will  look  good  so  that  your
stockholders  feel  good  about  you  and  invest  even  more  money  in
you?  How  do  we  strike  a  balance  that  looks  long  term  to  the  fu-
ture?

Mr.  SMITH.  If  I  could  start  a  response,  I  think—I  agree  with  ev-
erything  you  said  and  I  think  that  the  strategy  of  trying  to  bring
in  a  producer-responsibility  approach  into  the  United  States  and
really  importing  that  policy  initiative  from  Europe  and  elsewhere
is at least a part of the solution, because what that does is to inter-
nalize the costs of production into the full life cycle of the product,
and if the producers have to be responsible for those costs through-
out  the  entire  life  cycle,  they  are  going  to  tell  their  designers,  you
know,  let  us  figure  out  a  way  to  make  these  products  last  longer,
be  more  efficient  and  be  less  expensive  throughout  the  life  cycle.
So  the  point  is  that  if  they  have  to  pay  for  the  costs  of  recycling
and  disposal,  we  think  that  that  is  going  to  send  some  important

design  signals  up  to  the  front  end  where  it  really  belongs.  It  will
help shift that focus. It is probably not going to solve all the ques-
tions that you are raising because I do think that the rapid obsoles-
cence is the major thing.

You  probably  know  of  Moore’s  law,  which  was  based  on  Gordon
Moore,  one  of  the  founders  of  the  semiconductor  industry.  If  you
look  at  the  slope  of  change  in  the  industry,  it  looks  like  this.  It  is
a  logarithmic  scale  going  straight  up  to  the  sky.  When  you  look  at
the  slope  of  the  environmental  and  social  improvements  that  we
have,  it  is  a  much  shallower  slope  like  this.  I  think  our  job  is  to
try  to  figure  out  how  to  make  those  slopes  be  coincidental,  and
right now we are way out of whack on that, in my opinion.

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Williams,  and  Mr.  Hall  is

recognized for a unanimous-consent request.

Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, EPA has provided a written statement
to us and I ask unanimous consent that the statement be included
in  the  written  record  and  that  any  questions  Members  might  have
for EPA and their answers also be included, and I thank you.

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Hall,  and  I  will  raise  you
one.  Mike  Thompson,  the  Chairman  of  the  E–Waste  Caucus  also
has a statement that he would like to submit and I ask unanimous
consent that that be made part of the record.

Mr. HALL. I object.
Chairman GORDON. I think he is kidding.
Mr. HALL. I withdraw my objection.
Chairman  GORDON.  If  there  is  then—since  there  is  no  objection,

those two records will be made a part of the record.

[The information follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MIKE THOMPSON (D–CA)

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  comment  briefly  on  electronic  waste,  or  ‘‘e-
waste.’’ I appreciate Chairman Bart Gordon and Ranking Member Ralph Hall allow-
ing  me  to  submit  these  remarks  to  the  record  as  part  of  your  hearing  on  e-waste,
a subject I’ve been involved with since I was first elected to Congress.

As you will hear today from the other witnesses, electronic products are becoming
smaller  and  lighter,  but  they  also  are  creating  an  ever-growing  environmental  and
waste  disposal  problem.  That’s  because  it’s  often  cheaper  and  more  convenient  to
buy a new PC or cell phone than to upgrade an old one. Today, the average lifespan
of  a  computer  is  only  two  years  and  Americans  are  disposing  of  3,000  tons  of  com-
puters each day.

The buildup of e-waste on the local and State level has led sixteen states, includ-
ing  California,  Tennessee  and  Texas,  to  implement  their  own  e-waste  laws—each
very  different  from  one  another.  Thirteen  additional  states  are  also  considering  e-
waste  legislation.  As  states  continue  to  develop  their  own  approaches,  the  need  for
a federal solution grows. Without federal action, both consumers and businesses will
have  to  contend  with  an  unmanageable  patchwork  of  State  laws.  This  might  also
put  many  U.S.  manufacturers  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  if  they  have  to  juggle
multiple State regulations.

As  the  founder  of  the  Congressional  E–Waste  Working  Group,  I  along  with  co-
chairs  Congresswomen  Louise  Slaughter  and  Mary  Bono  Mack,  and  Congressman
Zach  Wamp,  with  the  assistance  of  Congressman  Wynn  and  Senators  Ron  Wyden,
Maria  Cantwell,  and  Sherrod  Brown  recently  submitted  a  comprehensive  concept
paper to nearly 60 stakeholders in the electronics industry. Five of the six witnesses
on  your  panel  this  morning  received  the  paper  and  have  since  commented  on  it.  I
want to thank them for their valuable feedback and I look forward to working with
them in near future as we craft this important legislation.

The concept paper represents an important step towards enacting a federal e-recy-
cling solution. It relies on an extended producer responsibility model, with manufac-
turers,  retailers  and  recyclers  sharing  the  responsibility  for  establishing  and  main-
taining a national program to collect, transport, reuse and recycle e-waste with little

or  no  cost  to  consumers  or  government.  The  document  incorporates  many  of  the
principles articulated in e-recycling proposals and comments put forth in past years
by  electronics  manufacturers,  the  environmental  community,  retailers,  recyclers,
waste handlers, the states, and other interested groups. It also addresses the export-
ing of e-waste to third world countries, the role of the states and the Environmental
Protection Agency, and creates incentives for greener production and reuse.

Thank  you  for  bringing  much  needed  attention  to  this  issue  and  to  allow  us  to
gather  expert  testimony  on  the  problem  of  e-waste.  The  other  members  of  the  E-
Waste Working Group and I look forward to working with you as we work towards
enacting a comprehensive plan to reduce e-waste in a way that considers the inter-
ests of all stakeholders.

Chairman GORDON. Mr. Lipinski, you can close us out.
Mr. LIPINSKI. Do we really have any time, Mr. Chairman?
Chairman  GORDON.  Well,  we  don’t  have  much.  If  you  want  to

have one question or statement.

Mr.  LIPINSKI.  I  just  want  to  say  that  there  has  to  be  some  way
of  working  this  in.  Very  quickly,  one  thing  that  I  find  difficult  is
not  knowing  as  a  consumer  what  needs  to  be  recycled.  I  had  a
VCR,  and  I  wasn’t  sure,  can  I  throw  this  in  the  trash,  what  do  I
do with this, so the information to begin with, and what is it—very
quickly,  Mr.  Williams,  why  is  Sony—why  did  Sony  take  this  step?
Why is Sony doing as much as you are doing?

Mr.  MICHAEL WILLIAMS.  It  is  the  right  thing  to  do,  number  one.
Number two, because it makes sense. You are being the responsible
producer.  You  hope  that  people  have  brand  loyalty  and  that  you
take responsibility for your product. I want to design and build in,
as  Ted  was  talking  about  earlier,  in  terms  of  market  efficiency.  If
I know it is going to be recycled, I am going to design it with parts
and  machinery  with  that  in  mind.  So  it  makes  sense  for  us  from
an economic point of view to recycle the products, to create recycled
waste  for,  let  us  say,  as  an  example,  plastic,  so  I  have  enough  of
a supply of post-consumer recycled plastic that I can use in my new
models,  and  so  we  have  to  create  the  supply  of  the  recycled  mate-
rial  in  order  to  put  it  into  our  new  products.  The  way  we  do  that
is to get our consumers who have the Sony products to bring them
to us and to recycle them. So it is in our interests, it is in the envi-
ronment’s  interest  to  do  what  we  are  doing  today  and  also  to  edu-
cate  the  American  public  that  going  green  is  good  for  business,  it
is  good  for  the  environment.  It  is  a  win-win  situation.  But  it  is
going to take some work and effort on the part of Congress through
initiatives,  legislation,  and  on  the  part  of  industry  to  educate  the
American  consumer  why  it  is  in  everyone’s  interest  to  recycle  re-
sponsibly and properly.

Mr.  LIPINSKI.  I  commend  Sony  on  that,  but  I  agree  that  there  is
more  that  we  are  going  to  have  to  do  to  make  sure  this  is  done
across the board. Thank you.

Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Lipinski.
Before  we  bring  the  hearing  to  a  close,  I  want  to  thank  our  wit-
nesses for testifying today. Mr. Hall also would like to know where
to take his Victrola.

Mr.  MICHAEL WILLIAMS.  I  don’t  think  that  has  the  Sony  brand

Chairman  GORDON.  The  record  will  remain  open  for  additional
statements  from  Members  and  for  answers  to  any  follow-up  ques-
tions  the  Committee  may  ask  of  the  witnesses,  and  let  me  ask,  is
there  anyone  that  wants  to  ask  the  witnesses  to  come  back  after

on it.

the joint hearing? If not, then again, I want to thank our witnesses.
We  are  going  to  submit  additional  questions  to  you.  This  is  an
issue  that  this  committee  is  very  interested  in,  and  we  consider
this  one  of  our  major  areas  of  concern  this  year,  and  as  I  say,  we
are  interested  in  knowing  on  the  federal  level—if  there  is—we  are
not  looking  to  do  something  if  there  is  not  something  there  to  do,
what  we  can  do  in  terms  of  research  to  help  on  the  recycling  end,
and if there is something on the front end to make it easier to recy-
cle as well as other areas.

So  with  that,  the  witnesses  are  excused  and  the  hearing  is  ad-

journed.

[Whereupon, at 10:58 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Eric  D.  Williams,  Assistant  Professor,  Department  of  Civil  and  Envi-

ronmental Engineering and School of Sustainability, Arizona State University

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. You state in your testimony that you and your colleagues’ review of the scientific
literature concluded that the risks associated with disposing electronics in sani-
tary  landfills  are  negligible.  You  also  mention  that  the  EPA’s  Toxicity  Char-
acteristic  Leaching  Procedure  (TCPL)  test  is  ‘‘more  aggressive’’  than  the  actual
conditions in landfills. What type of further study is needed to accurately assess
the  environmental  and  human  health  impacts  of  electronics  disposed  in  land-
fills?

A1. It is possible that the core research establishing the risk of toxics leaching from
sanitary  landfills  is  mainly  done.  I  suggest  that  if  the  National  Research  Council
were asked to do a study on the interfaces between the risk of toxics leaching from
landfills,  the  TCLP  test  and  e-waste  that  it  would  be  a  valuable  step  to  gauge  the
degree of scientific knowledge and consensus on this issue. This report would clarify
if and what further work is needed.

I think an important related issue is the potential to mine landfills at a later date
to recover valuable materials. Existing research suggests that despite favorable con-
centrations of valuable materials in landfills compared to ore deposits, the relatively
small  size  of  the  landfill  ‘‘deposit’’  pose  a  challenge  to  recycle  from  landfills  at  low
cost.  There  are  strategies  however  which  ought  to  be  researched.  One  strategy  is
to consider how defining a new waste category as material destined for future recov-
ery  would  affect  the  economics  and  environmental  issues  associated  with  mining
landfills.  A  second  strategy  to  work  on  developing  materials  recovery  processes
which economically scale favorably down to smaller deposit sizes.
Q2. You say in your testimony that end-of-life management for electronics is a quali-
tatively  new  challenge  and  that  we  do  not  have  the  proper  tools  to  measure  the
impacts  of  recycling  and  other  end-of-life  policy  options.  What  types  of  tools  do
we need to make these assessments and what type of research is necessary to de-
velop these tools? Which agencies would be best to fund this type of research and
how should it be prioritized?
• What funding opportunities exist in addition to the National Science Founda-
tion’s  Environmental  Sustainability  Program  to  study  and  assess  the  end-of-
life management of electronics and other products?
• You  mention  in  your  testimony  that  Japan  is  investing  more  than  the  U.S.  to
characterize and plan for the management of international end-of-life flows for
a  variety  of  consumer  products.  By  not  investing  in  the  analysis  of  this  issue,
is the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage?

A2. What opportunities exist other than NSF Environmental Sustainability to sup-
port research related to end-of-life electronics? To summarize, few and far between.
Regions  4  and  5  offices  of  the  USEPA  have  supported  the  work  at  the  University
of  Florida  on  leaching  potentials  from  landfills.  While  in  principle  research  on  elec-
tronics reuse/recycling could be supported as part of federal and State programs ad-
dressing  waste  related  issues,  I  know  of  no  dedicated  programs  devoted  to  e-waste.
In practice, it is definitely an underfunded area.

The  NSF  and  EPA  are  natural  agencies  from  which  to  base  future  research  on
management  of  end-of-life  electronics.  NSF  could  focus  on  the  more  fundamental
knowledge  needs  while  EPA  could  focus  on  applications.  I  hesitate  to  prioritize  re-
search topics in an ordered listed as society needs to decide what aspects of the end-
of-life electronics it deems most important and weigh issues accordingly. I scope out
below how I view the main challenges and some of the research related to address-
ing these challenges:

• Global  environmental  impacts—from  a  global  perspective  the  main  environ-
mental  impacts  associated  with  end-of-life  electronics  are  probably  due  to  in-
formal  recycling  in  developing  countries.  Research  addressing  this  would  in-
clude  1.  exploring  policy/business  models  to  develop  new  systems  for  man-
aging  global  end-of-life  flows  2.  research  into  alternative  recycling  tech-
nologies.
• Domestic  environmental  impacts—for  people  in  the  U.S.  I  believe  the  main
potential  exposure  issue  is  brominated  flame  retardants.  Research  is  needed
to  determine  the  risk  of  these  substances  and  to  develop  and  assess  alter-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:58 Aug 25, 2008 Jkt 041901 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\043008\41901 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

63

natives in view of the improved fire safety gained from flame retardants. The
energy  use  associated  with  production  and  manufacture  of  equipment  is  an
important  issue  to  consider  from  global  warming  and  resource  scarcity  per-
spectives.  Potential  health  impacts  due  to  exposure  to  electromagnetic  fields
should also receive more attention.
• Social and economic benefits—Reuse and recycling of electronics is an impor-
tant  economic  activity  and  access  to  low-cost  used  machines  delivers  social
benefits.  On  the  technology  side,  developing  informatics  systems  such  as
RFID  tags  can  help  improve  the  functioning  of  reuse/reusing.  Also,  work  is
needed  to  develop  and  assess  electronics  policy  alternatives  which  encourage
reuse.
• Applications of Information Technology—while I understand the focus here is
on  end-of-life  management  issues,  it  is  also  important  to  bear  in  mind  that
there  are  many  important  environmental  applications  of  information  tech-
nology.  The  potential  benefits  outweigh  much  of  the  environmental  risk  of
equipment  in  my  opinion.  More  research  is  needed  to  develop  and  promote
adoption of applications such as home energy management systems, Internet-
enabled ride sharing programs, and telecommuting.

News tools and methods to be developed in this research include multi-issue mod-
els  of  alternate  reuse/recycling  systems,  computer-aided  toxicity  screening  methods,
materials/emissions models of different recycling processes, simulation models of en-
vironmental/economic/social  implications  of  different  global  paths  for  electronics,
and designs for informatics systems supporting reuse and recycling (e.g., RFID sys-
tems).

Is the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage compared to Japan due to its relatively
small  investment  in  research  and  development  related  to  green  electronics?  Poten-
tially  yes,  although  the  economic  impacts  are  difficult  to  gauge.  There  are  two  as-
pects,  manufacturing  and  reuse/recycling.  For  manufacturing,  Japan  has  been
proactive in responding to the European Directive on Restriction on Hazardous Sub-
stances  which  regulates  materials  used  in  electronics.  U.S.  manufacturers  on  the
other hand objected to the European legislation on scientific grounds and have been
less willing to respond. I believe U.S. manufacturers had valid concerns about policy
developments in Europe, but at the time there was insufficient research activity by
neutral parties (e.g. academia) in the U.S. engineering/scientific community to weigh
in  substantively  on  the  debate.  Ultimately  the  European  legislation  went  through
in spite of the questions raised by U.S. industry. The outcome is that the Japanese
electronics  is  relatively  well  situated  to  deliver  products  meetings  the  new  regula-
tions in Europe and elsewhere.

Considering the end-of-life, Japan is also being proactive in working to assess and
address concerns being raised regarding the environmental impacts of international
flows  of  end-of-life  electronics.  The  relative  lack  of  response  in  the  U.S.  may  have
been  based  on  the  perception  that  environmental  problems  of  end-of-life  electronics
abroad  are  the  jurisdiction  of  recipient  countries.  However,  public  pressure  on  this
issue is resulting in response even if the Federal Government takes no action. Many
nations  are  implementing  bans  on  importing  e-waste.  NGOs  are  developing  guide-
lines  for  environmentally  friendly  recycling  practices  which  many  firms  follow  in
order to maintain a positive perception by customers. The result is that U.S. manu-
facturers are increasingly acting in an policy environment in which the U.S. had has
little voice. Investments in research and development are part of a process through
which the U.S. can engage in and influence the international discourse.

In  addition,  the  internationalization  of  reuse  and  recycling  may  present  a  busi-
ness opportunity for those firms situated to take advantage of trends. For example,
there  is  an  increasing  international  need  for  technologies  and  facilities  which  can
safely recover valuable metals from circuit boards. Japanese smelters such as those
operated  by  Dowa  Holdings  have  advanced  technologies  and  could  serve  future
international markets for recycling services.
Q3. In  your  testimony  you  propose  interesting  ideas  to  facilitate  reuse  and  prevent
harmful recycling practices in developing countries. What would be needed to de-
velop  and  evaluate  ideas  like  the  use  of  Radio  Frequency  Identification  (RFID)
technology  to  indicate  functionality  or  link  a  recycling  deposit  to  a  piece  of
equipment? How can innovative management options be encouraged?

A3. The  first  step  is  a  set  of  high-level  feasibility  studies  exploring  technological,
economic and other aspects of different proposals. Based on the result of these feasi-
bility  studies,  specific  research  is  needed  to  develop  the  most  promising  options.
Some of this research will be product engineering/technology related, such as the de-
sign  and  integration  of  RFID  tags  in  computers.  Another  aspect  of  the  research  re-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:58 Aug 25, 2008 Jkt 041901 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\043008\41901 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

64

lates to design and operation of the overall system, which should integrate engineer-
ing, business and social aspects.

How  can  innovative  management  options  be  encouraged?  It  may  be  that  the  new
technology and management system go hand-in-hand with new policy. For example,
one  proposal  my  colleagues  and  I  at  Arizona  State  have  made  is  for  an  electronics
take-back system which establishes an Internet market in which reuse and recycling
companies  compete  to  offer  consumers  rebates  on  a  prepaid  recycling  deposit.  This
system would utilize RFID and other information infrastructures. Thus in this case
the  innovative  management  system  is  integrated  with  policy.  A  general  strategy  to
encourage  innovative  management  options  is  to  encourage  joint  industry/academic
research to couple academic understanding of the issues with real world commercial
systems to enable workable solutions to real problems.
Q4. What  policy  tools  would  you  suggest  to  compel  electronics  producers  to  consider
end-of-life  management  in  their  product  designs?  If  CRTs  are  permitted  into
landfills,  how  do  we  encourage  green  engineering  and  the  thorough  evaluation
of materials before they are used products?

A4. To summarize my response, I recommend first exploration of voluntary product
certification  and  take-back  systems  which  explicitly  create  a  market  for  improved
designs. There are three types of policy tools currently on the table. The first is com-
mand-and-control  mandating  of  design  aspects,  the  European  Directive  Restriction
on  Hazardous  Substances  is  the  prime  example  of  this  approach.  Though  not  ad-
dressing recycling, there is precedent for this type of approach in the U.S.: the appli-
ance efficiency standards managed by the Department of Energy.

The second type of policy is voluntary certification programs such as Energy Star.
A  new  computer  certification  scheme,  EPEAT,  includes  recycling  and  reuse  related
aspects. Voluntary certification programs seem to have an effect well beyond the de-
mand of individual consumers for green products. This is partly because green pur-
chasing programs for organizations create a market for certified products which one
designed spills over into other markets. Another factor is that firms compete to gain
certification  as  a  means  to  establish  an  image  of  a  socially  responsible  corporation.
The  third  approach  is  economic  instruments.  Making  manufacturers  responsible
for recycling under the mantle of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a pop-
ular approach. The challenge is to develop a system which is both workable in prac-
tice  and  provide  a  clear  economic  incentive  to  improve  design.  Take-back  systems
have  yet  to  be  successful  in  inducing  substantial  design  shifts.  One  strategy  is  to
develop  take-back  system  which  explicitly  create  a  market  over  which  manufactur-
ers and reuse and recycling firms compete to deliver more efficient services. We are
developing such a concept at Arizona State which we term the e-market for e-waste.
The  idea  is  that  at  the  end-of-life  firms  compete  to  offer  consumers  higher  levels
of return on a prepaid recycling fee.

How  do  we  encourage  green  engineering  and  thorough  evaluations  of  material
used in products? In short, I believe work is needed to build a method and modeling
infrastructure which allows for a realistic assessment of the macroscopic risk associ-
ated  with  using  different  materials  in  products.  Based  on  results  from  these  macro
risk assessments, stakeholder groups recommend on a product by product basis ap-
propriate  green  engineering  incentives  such  as  voluntary  certification,  economic
tools and/or regulation.

There  are  two  aspects  of  managing  toxics.  The  first  is  assessing  the  toxicity  of  a
substance.  Given  the  variety  of  new  chemicals  and  materials  being  developed  and
in use combined with vastly more sensitive detection equipment, this assessment is
a significant challenge. Computer-based modeling of substances and their biological
activity will presumably better help us screen toxicity. I suggest that more resources
be devoted to developing such models. This being said, for the foreseeable future we
will  still  need  empirical  work  on  fate,  exposure  and  epidemiological  effects,  which
also requires research resources.

The second aspect of managing toxicity is assessing how toxics in products might
actually  end  up  with  exposures  and  damage  health.  Surprisingly  this  is  not  often
studied.  For  example,  given  all  the  attention  given  to  the  potential  risks  of  lead
leaching from CRTs, one would assume that there are many existing studies which
total  up  the  total  potential  lead  emissions  from  CRTs  going  to  landfills  and  show
that  the  potential  leaching  is  significant  compared  to  other  problems  we  have  with
lead,  such  as  paint  or  pipes  in  legacy  buildings.  Apparently  no  one  has  done  this
yet. Much more work needs to be done to scale up the product level content of toxics
to  potential  macroscopic  levels  of  risk.  The  result  of  not  doing  this  research  is  that
regulations are liable to equate toxicity with hazard, resulting in inefficient and in-
effective regulation.

Q5. In  traditional  undergraduate  engineering  curriculum,  how  much  attention  do
life cycle assessments and end-of-life management receive? What types of changes
can be made to encourage our future engineers to prioritize these issues?

A5. In  general,  very  little  attention  is  given  to  LCA  or  other  sustainable  engineer-
ing  issues.  There  are  exceptions  where  an  instructor  will  find  a  way  to  work  such
material in, but currently such material is hardly ever part of an official curriculum.
I believe that in the future we need to incorporate sustainability aspects into core
engineering curricula to introduce all students to basic issues and methods. In addi-
tion,  we  need  to  provide  avenues  for  students  interested  in  sustainability  to  learn
in depth.

The Center for Sustainable Engineering, a joint initiative by Carnegie Mellon, the
University  of  Texas—Austin,  and  Arizona  State  University  is  funded  by  both  NSF
and  EPA  and  aims  to  integrate  sustainability  aspects  including  LCA  into  engineer-
ing curricula. It is, however, a beginning effort, and there should be much more at-
tention paid to this requirement.
Q6. In your testimony, you propose a method to make the informal recycling of elec-
tronics  safer  in  developing  countries,  where  workers  would  be  paid  for  targeted
parts  like  wires,  but  not  the  actual  commodities.  This  would  discourage  them
from unsafely processing materials. Who should invest in evaluating and devel-
oping innovative markets to end or mitigate harmful recycling practices abroad?
A6. Who  should  invest  in  subsidy  system  to  prevent  informal  recycling  in  devel-
oping  countries?  It  is  my  view  that  if  an  organization  or  individual  in  the  U.S.  or
another  country  receives  economic  benefit  due  to  exporting  end-of-life  electronics,
this  should  also  entail  an  investment  to  ensure  safe  recycling  abroad.  Practically
speaking  this  could  mean  that  recycling  fees  collected  domestically  for  take-back
systems would involve international monetary flow if the equipment is exported. Do-
mestic  generation  of  e-waste  in  developing  countries  is  increasing  and  monetary
flows should be mobilized internally to ensure safe recycling.

There  is  in  addition  an  economic  investment  associated  with  initial  research  de-
velopment of knowledge and technology bases to enable the new reuse/recycling sys-
tems.  There  is  a  strong  argument  that  much  of  this  R&D  should  be  undertaken  by
developed areas such as the U.S., Europe and Japan.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. How  have  electronics  in  the  waste  stream  changed  over  the  past  decade  and
what predictions can we make about changes in the coming years? How do these
changes  affect  our  ability  to  safely  and  efficiently  recycle  or  reuse  these  devices?
A1. This  is  a  very  pertinent  question  given  the  rapid  evolution  of  products  in  the
sector.  There  are  three  main  issues.  One  is  changes  in  the  use  of  precious  metals
in electronics over time. In the late 1980’s and early 1990’s products used to contain
substantially  more  gold,  silver  and  other  precious  metals,  which  made  recycling
more  economically  attractive.  These  amounts  have  gone  down  over  time.  There  are
contravening  trends  however.  High  capacity  hard  disks  tend  to  contain  more  plat-
inum  than  previous  generations.  At  any  rate,  it  is  difficult  to  design  recycling  sys-
tems where the economic are a moving target.

The  second  issue  is  the  increasing  diversity  of  devices.  E-waste  is  no  longer  only
televisions, stereos and desktop computers, it is also laptops, VCR and DVD players,
game consoles, cell phones and personal data assistants. Uniform waste streams are
generally easier to recycle, but e-waste has become more and more diverse.

The third issue is that many of these new product types such as laptop computers
and  cell  phones  are  switching  to  smaller  more  packed  designs  which  are  harder  to
disassemble.

One  result  of  this  trend  has  been  the  increased  use  of  shredders.  Products  with
valuable components such as components may be dissembled by hand but most oth-
ers tend to be put into a shredder after removing certain parts of concern. Material
recycling  rates  for  shredder-based  systems  are  reasonable  but  clearly  the  level  of
reuse is reduced.
Q2. Most major manufacturers claim that they do not ship e-waste oversees for recy-
cling. Where does the e-waste found in environmentally unsound recycling oper-
ations originate?

A2. With  the  exception  of  equipment  leased  by  the  manufacturer,  the  end-of-life
fate of electronics is in the hands of the purchaser, not the manufacturer. Reuse and
recycling companies who ship abroad can often offer to pay for the equipment rather
than be paid by the disposer to recycle domestically, so there is a natural economic

66

incentive  to  choose  those  firms  which  ship  abroad.  Looking  at  recycling  operations
abroad,  reports  by  NGOs  suggest  that  a  substantial  part  of  the  e-waste  being  recy-
cled was originally from the U.S. and other developed countries.
Q3. What are some of the toxic hazards that arise in the recycling process itself?
A3. For  informal  recycling  the  big  problems  are  obvious.  Open  burning  of  wires  to
recover copper generates dioxins, furans and other toxics. Acid and cyanide leaching
of circuit boards create serious pollution problems unless properly managed.

For formal recycling the situation is much less clear. Recycling circuit boards usu-
ally involves melting the boards in a copper smelter. The resulting slag is then proc-
essed  to  separate  the  different  metals.  The  heat  of  the  smelter  releases  toxic  sub-
stances such as lead and mercury as well as various brominated organics. With ap-
propriate technologies one would presume that these toxic emissions are controlled.
There is a dramatic lack of information on the emissions and energy use in different
stages of recycling. It is worth noting that copper smelters in the U.S. are reluctant
to  recycle  scrap  circuit  boards  because  of  the  entailing  difficulty  to  meet  EPA  air
regulations.  More  research  is  needed  to  clarify  the  materials  use  and  emissions  as-
sociated with different recycling methods.
Q4. You lay out an ambitious agenda for what needs to be done from an R&D stand-
point. However, accomplishing this work requires a skilled science and engineer-
ing workforce in green engineering. Do U.S. universities train a workforce suffi-
cient  for  this  task  and  if  not  how  many  more  programs  would  be  required  in
order to fulfill this need?

A4. For  e-waste  and  other  environmental  issues  such  as  climate  change  the  U.S.
needs a human workforce expert in sustainable engineering. While training of such
engineers  and  scientists  is  increasing,  I  estimate  that  we  are  still  not  yet  near  to
meeting  the  potential  demand  for  sustainability  engineers  and  scientists.  This  is  a
three  pronged  challenge.  The  first  is  to  encourage  more  transdisciplinary  engineer-
ing education in areas such as sustainable engineering and earth systems engineer-
ing  and  management.  The  second  is  to  improve  disciplinary  education  by  intro-
ducing students to real world social and environmental complexity entailed in their
engineering  area.  The  third  is  to  introduce  concepts  of  sustainable  engineering  in
K-12 as well as in undergraduate/graduate education, ensuring that we have a more
technologically competent workforce generally.

While  it  is  difficult  to  give  a  precise  number  for  a  desired  number  of  programs,
in green electronics the U.S. would benefit from several centers capable of research
and training in different aspects of the challenge. Some centers could focus on more
technical  issues  such  as  development  and  assessment  of  new  materials  while  other
could  be  more  interdisciplinary  and  integrative  in  nature.  Considering  sustainable
engineering  more  broadly,  the  Federal  Government  could  play  a  key  role  in  pro-
moting  sustainable  engineering  by  increasing  funding  to  NSF,  EPA  and  DOE  to-
wards university research programs.
Q5. What  organizations  in  the  U.S.  and  abroad  are  capable  of  performing  assess-

ments on recycling, reuse, and landfilling processes and practices?

A5. I cannot here review the full set of organizations around the globe with capacity
to  address  this  issue,  I  mention  a  few  of  the  main  ones  currently  active  on  green
electronics. Focusing first on the domestic situation within our universities, between
myself,  Braden  Allenby  and  our  collaborators  and  students,  Arizona  State  Univer-
sity  has  a  group  which  is  strong  at  LCA  and  an  integrative  systems  perspective.
Timothy  Townsend  and  collaborators  at  University  of  Florida  have  particular  expe-
rience and capacity to study landfills issues. Hong Zhang and collaborators at Texas
Tech  University  have  been  working  on  developing  new  recycling  technologies.  A
group  at  University  of  California–Irvine  has  been  working  on  engineering  and  as-
sessment issues related to lead-free electronics.

Manufacturers,  including  U.S.  based  Dell  and  HP  have  personnel  dedicated  to
green  electronics  issues.  The  groups  are  small  and  mainly  focused  on  compliance
issues.  Japanese  manufacturers  in  comparison  support  research  and  development
groups devoted to life cycle assessment and development of green electronics.

The  U.S.  EPA  Office  of  Solid  Waste  has  experience  and  expertise  related  to  e-
waste.  Claire  Lindsay,  Robert  Tonnetti  and  Angie  Leith  have  been  involved  in  im-
portant  e-waste  related  work  such  as  the  recent  benchmark  assessment  of  genera-
tion and disposition of end-of-life electronics in the U.S. Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory  is  very  active  with  regards  to  operational  electricity  use  for  electronics,
though not end-of-life issues.

Looking abroad to Europe and Japan one sees a comparatively large degree of re-

been active in assessing take-back and recycling policies. One of the Frauenhofer In-
stitutes  in  Germany  is  has  a  substantive  group  active  in  electronics  manufacturing
and e-waste. The Swiss federal research institute EMPA is the home to what is the
largest  research  project  addressing  international  issues  related  to  reuse  and  recy-
cling of electronics. Japan is very active both in terms of technology issues and larg-
er systems assessment. The National Institute of Environment is a laboratory spon-
sored  by  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  is  prominently  active  is  characterizing
international  material  and  product  flows.  The  Institute  for  Advanced  Science  and
Technology, sponsored by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry is active in
both life cycle assessment of electronics and green design issues.

Questions submitted by Representative Daniel Lipinski
Q1. In  2006,  the  Government  Accountability  Office  estimated  that  more  than  100
million  computers,  TVs,  and  monitors  are  thrown  away  each  year.  In  addition,
the EPA estimates that electronic waste is growing two to three times faster than
any other waste stream. Yet presently, there is no specific federal law or regula-
tion  governing  the  disposal  of  consumer  electronic  products  in  the  U.S.  Should
there be?

A1. The  short  answer  is  yes.  Various  states  are  developing  and  enacting  their  own
electronics  take-back  and  recycling  systems.  A  patchwork  of  State-level  systems  is
inefficient  and  manufacturers  have  to  devote  significant  resources  just  to  keep  up
with  the  different  regulations.  Plus,  states  have  fewer  resources  to  invest  in  re-
search  and  development  to  develop  and  assess  alternatives  and  thus  have  largely
borrowed  much  from  systems  abroad.  As  I  discussed  in  my  testimony,  were  based
more on simple heuristic goals which may not be efficient.
Q2. The EPA estimates that at most, only 15% of products at the end of their useful
lives  reach  a  recycling  or  reuse  program.  This  does  not  come  as  a  shock  to  me.
In  fact,  it  might  seem  a  little  high  given  the  impediments  that  consumers  cur-
rently face.
• First, how are average consumers to know what to do with their e-waste when
• This  past  weekend,  Washington,  D.C.  held  an  e-waste  recycling  day.  Over  ten
times  as  many  residents  as  last  year  showed  to  recycle  their  gadgets,  leading
to  over  two  hours  wait  time.  The  incentives  to  recycle  just  don’t  seem  to  be
there right now. What do you recommend be done to fix this problem?

it comes to the end of its useful life?

A2. Municipalities  are  traditionally  charged  with  informing  average  consumers
about  how  to  recycle.  Depending  on  the  community  the  level  and  effectiveness  of
this  communication  varies  considerably.  Communication  may  be  enhanced  by  link-
ing  in  with  people’s  personal  computers.  I.e.,  there  could  be  pre-installed  applica-
tions on computers which hook up with databases with information on the recycling
and reuse practices of different locales.

Also, if the take-back and reuse/recycling system includes a financial incentive to
return  machines  (i.e.,  a  returned  deposit),  I  suspect  that  word  of  mouth  becomes  a
more  effective  means  of  communication.  One  way  to  introduce  such  an  incentive  is
a  new  type  of  take-back  system  we  are  developing  at  Arizona  State.  The  basic  con-
cept  of  the  e-market  for  e-waste  model  is  that  at  the  end-of-life  firms  compete  to
offer consumers higher levels of return on a prepaid recycling fee.

Regarding the unfortunately long wait times at the DC event, I suspect that peri-
odic  recycling  events  are  a  temporary  way-station  on  the  path  to  a  national  reuse/
recycling  system.  In  an  organized  system  these  events  would  not  be  needed.  Until
we  get  a  national  system  however  recycling  events  will  remain  one  way  to  collect
equipment. Some problems might be avoided is a manual of best practice was devel-
oped and made widely available to those planning such events.
Q3. The  European  Union  is  often  ahead  of  the  United  States  when  it  comes  to  the
issue  of  recycling.  Where  do  U.S.  capabilities  stand  as  compared  to  Europe  on
the topic of e-waste?

A3. Currently  behind.  Europe  and  Japan  have  advanced  smelters  with  experience
in  recovering  precious  metals  in  circuit  boards.  The  university  and  government  re-
search base is larger and governments have mandated take-back and recycling sys-
tems.  On  the  other  hand,  the  U.S.  does  have  a  fifteen  year  history  of  addressing
green  electronics  issues  through  the  IEEE  International  Symposium  on  Electronics
and  the  Environment  which  has  been  held  annually  since  1993.  This  is  an  impor-
tant base of results and expertise to draw on.

Still, I believe that the U.S. has strong potential to become a world leader in effi-
cient  reuse  and  recycling  systems.  We  have  excellent  research  universities  and  a
tradition  of  partnership  between  universities  and  industry.  The  U.S.  is  more  ori-
ented  towards  combining  environmental  solutions  with  free  market  efficiencies.
Given  the  importance  of  reuse  in  environmental  performance  this  emphasis  should
serve  us  well.  The  U.S.  economy  has  shown  a  particular  adaptability  and  openness
to adopting new technologies such as the Internet and its applications.

Questions submitted by Representative Bob Inglis
Q1. In  your  testimony  you  suggest  that  take-back  systems  could  have  an  adverse  ef-
fect on reuse. Can you expand upon this? If most reuse occurs in developing na-
tions, wouldn’t take-back campaigns give companies the opportunity to efficiently
redistribute their wares?

A1. Yes,  take-back  campaigns  do  present  an  opportunity  for  reuse,  whether  reuse
is helped or hindered depends on the implementation. Many existing take-back sys-
tems  measure  success  in  terms  of  achievement  of  domestic  materials  recycling  and
do  not  include  incentives  for  reuse.  In  Japan,  for  example,  some  equipment  manu-
facturers have a policy of disassembling any product which they receive through the
take-back system regardless of its newness and condition. This practice is supported
by  high  recycling  fees  paid  by  consumers  and  without  the  system  it  is  more  likely
that  some  of  the  equipment  would  have  been  reused  abroad.  On  the  other  hand,  a
take-back system designed with reuse in mind could enhance the collection of reus-
able machines in good condition for export.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Gerardo  N.  Castro,  Director  of  Environmental  Services  and  Contracts,

Goodwill Industries of Southern California

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. You mentioned that Goodwill does expect an influx of televisions due to the dig-
ital  transition.  Has  your  organization  made  plans  for  how  it  will  handle  this
increased volume?

A1. Goodwill  Industries  of  Southern  California  is  making  plans  to  increase  our
staffing  and  infrastructure  to  ensure  that  we  are  ready  to  accept,  store,  and  ship
an increased number of analog televisions. In addition, we are exploring opportuni-
ties that would allow us to provide people who buy working analog televisions with
coupons  that  would  enable  them  to  purchase  digital  converter  boxes  at  a  reduced
cost. In addition, we are exploring partnerships to expand our ability to process elec-
tronic  waste.  For  example,  after  the  April  30  hearing,  we  met  with  representatives
from  Sony  to  explore  a  partnership  between  Goodwill  and  Sony.  We  are  still  work-
ing out the details of the partnership.

Goodwill Industries International, Inc. is working to build collaborations modeled
after  the  Dell  Reconnect  program  and  ideally  would  like  electronic  manufacturers
to  work  collaboratively  together.  Local  Goodwill  agencies  may  have  different  plans
for  the  transition.  Some  have  simply  chosen  not  to  accept  analog  televisions;  how-
ever, they still expect that they will receive analog televisions left at donation sites
during hours when the sites are not staffed.
Q2. In  your  testimony,  you  mention  that  Goodwill  is  unable  to  resell  a  substantial
number  of  the  electronic  products  they  receive.  Is  this  mainly  an  issue  of  dura-
bility  or  obsolescence?  What  types  of  design  changes  would  help  in  the  repair
and upgrade of this equipment?

A2. When  Goodwill  receives  electronic  products,  we  inspect  them  to  determine
whether  they  are  working.  Those  that  are  working,  we  resell  them  in  our  stores.
However,  we  often  discover  that  the  electronic  product  is  not  working.  While  many
of the non-working computers we receive could be candidates for being refurbished,
due to planned obsolescence in the design of hardware and software, we have found
that replacements for non-working parts are often no longer being produced by their
manufacturers.

Incentives to design standardized products and components that are universal and
interchangeable would help to lengthen the life of electronic products. For example,
universal chargers for cell phones or universal printer cartridges for printers would
help  to  reduce  the  amount  of  electronic  waste  that  we  receive  while  extending  the
life of discarded working electronic products.
Q3. In  your  testimony,  you  state  that  about  20  percent  of  the  products  you  receive
are neither resold nor dismantled into salvageable and recyclable parts and are
sent  directly  to  recyclers.  What  prevents  the  dismantling  of  these  products  by
Goodwill employees? Also, what type of oversight do Goodwill agencies use to en-
sure that they are contracting with responsible recyclers?

A3. The  bulk  of  the  products  that  we  send  directly  to  recyclers  are  CRT  monitors
that  are  not  working  and  we  are  not  able  to  resell.  The  proper  process  for  disman-
tling and breaking down electronic products that use CRTs and other hazardous ma-
terials  requires  costly  and  expensive  equipment  and  facilities.  Acquiring  the  in-
house capacity to process CRTs would represent a sizable investment from Goodwill
Industries  of  California.  It  makes  better  financial  sense  for  Goodwill  Industries  of
Southern California to send CRT monitors directly to recyclers. Because these recy-
clers are authorized by the State of California, we are assured by the State of Cali-
fornia,  which  audits  recyclers  to  ensure  that  products  are  being  recycled  properly,
that the recyclers we use are responsibly processing the CRT monitors we send.
Q4. In your testimony, you state that the Federal Government can play an important
role  in  assisting  the  development  and  sustainability  of  electronics  recycling  and
reuse  infrastructure.  What  specifically  could  the  Federal  Government  do  to  bol-
ster this industry?

A4. First,  the  Federal  Government  could  create  a  nation-wide  financial  mechanism
to  help  stakeholders—including  producers,  recyclers,  collectors,  states  and  munici-
palities—to  support  efforts  to  collect,  reuse,  and  recycle  electronic  products.  For  ex-
ample,  the  Federal  Government,  by  utilizing  incentives,  could  aid  and  encourage

necessary  private  sector  investment  in  the  used  electronic  recycling/reuse  markets.
This  can  be  done  through  tax  credits  for  manufacturers  who  partner  with  social
agencies, recycling grants, and other initiatives that could spur innovative solutions
and help stakeholders handle this problem. A partnership consisting of government
incentives, private industry and social agencies can protect the environment, create
jobs  and  spur  innovation  in  the  environmental  field.  Additionally,  increased  federal
support  for  pilot  projects  and  other  sustainable  initiatives  would  be  helpful  in  pro-
moting the development of a recycling/reuse infrastructure.

Second, create disincentives, such as phasing in a nationwide landfill ban, for dis-

posing electronic products, including televisions, in landfills.

Lastly,  the  Federal  Government  also  can  play  a  key  role  in  educating  consumers

about how to properly dispose of their unwanted electronic products.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. How  have  electronics  in  the  waste  stream  changed  over  the  past  decade  and
what predictions can we make about changes in the coming years? How do these
changes  affect  our  ability  to  safely  and  efficiency  recycle  or  reuse  these  devices?
A1. Goodwill Industries of Southern California is seeing a huge increase in the vol-
ume and variety in electronic products that are donated. Spurred by the production
of  cheaper  electronics,  rapidly  advancing  technology,  and  the  emergence  of  popular
electronic  gadgets,  the  consumption  of  electronics  is  dramatically  increasing  while
the lifespan of electronics is relatively short.

In  the  past,  many  electronic  products  were  designed  such  that  it  made  financial
sense to repair them when they broke. Today, it is often cheaper to discard malfunc-
tioning  consumer  electronics  and  to  replace  them  with  newer  and  more  technically
advanced  products.  Recycling  begins  with  design.  Manufactures  should  be  encour-
aged to design products that are more easily refurbished and recycled.
Q2. How does Goodwill train its employees to properly disassemble electronic equip-
ment?  What  are  the  greatest  challenges  to  quickly  and  efficiently  breaking  elec-
tronics down into basic commodities?

A2. Goodwill  Industries  of  Southern  California’s  training  program  consists  of  an
eight-step  de-manufacturing  process.  People  with  disabilities  are  taught  each  task
in the process one step at a time. When they show that they have learned that spe-
cific  task  and  can  perform  it  safely,  we  teach  them  the  next  task  in  the  process.
For  a  variety  of  reasons,  such  as  a  physical  impediment,  some  people  may  not  be
suited  to  perform  certain  tasks  in  the  de-manufacturing  process.  However,  we  still
teach  our  employees  about  all  the  tasks  to  build  teamwork  and  a  better  under-
standing of the complete process.

Design variety represents a significant challenge for the Goodwill employees that
de-manufacture electronic products. The de-manufacturing process could be stream-
lined if manufacturers produced products that met certain universal design criteria.
Q3. Dr.  Williams  suggests  that  some  take-back  programs  have  an  adverse  effect  on
reuse. Do you agree with this assessment: What effect does your organization see
on  reuse  of  commodities  like  cell  phones  due  to  the  increase  in  take-back  cam-
paigns?

A3. Goodwill  Industries  of  Southern  California  has  not  experienced  an  adverse  af-
fect  on  the  reuse  of  electronic  products  due  to  the  implementation  of  California’s
law, which involves an advanced recovery fee. Goodwill Industries of Southern Cali-
fornia  is  an  authorized  collector  under  California’s  program.  Whether  the  donated
product is a shirt or a computer, Goodwill Industries of Southern California first at-
tempts  to  resell  the  donation  in  one  of  its  retail  stores.  The  funds  we  raise  from
the  sale  of  the  donation  are  used  to  support  employment  services  for  people  with
barriers  to  employment  in  the  area.  In  the  case  of  CRT  monitors,  we  first  test  the
monitor to determine whether it is working. If it is, we attempt to resell it for reuse
before  we  send  the  CRT  monitor  to  an  authorized  recycler.  Our  attempts  to  resell
working CRT monitors are usually successful.

Q1. In  2006,  the  Government  Accountability  Office  estimated  that  more  than  100

tion  governing  the  disposal  of  consumer  electronic  products  in  the  U.S.  Should
there be?

A1. Yes.  Research  shows  that  the  improper  disposal  of  electronic  waste  in  the
United  States  creates  serious  environmental  and  public  health  concerns.  It  also  is
an  opportunity  to  create  jobs  and  develop  designs  that  would  help  reduce  the
amount  of  electronic  waste  that  is  disposed  of  each  year.  The  Federal  Government
should enact electronic waste laws and regulations that create jobs in the computer
reuse and recycling fields; and encourage manufactures to develop products that are
more amenable to being reused, refurbished, or recycled.
Q2. The  EPA  estimates  that  at  most,  only  15  percent  of  products  at  the  end  of  their
useful  lives  reach  a  recycling  or  reuse  program.  This  does  not  come  as  a  shock
to me. In fact, it might seem a little high given the impediments that consumers
currently face.

there right now. What do you recommend be done to fix this program?

it comes to the end of its life?

A2. Because  Goodwill  already  has  a  strong  existing  infrastructure,  local  Goodwill
agencies  are  in  a  unique  position  to  collaborate  with  producers  who  are  operating
take-back  programs  by  offering  convenient  locations  for  consumers  to  dispose  of
their unwanted electronic products. Consumers have been bringing their gently used
items  to  local  Goodwill  agencies  for  105  years,  so  people  know  that  they  can  bring
their gently used commodities, whether it is a shirt or a computer, to a local Good-
will and we will reuse it or recycle it. In 2007, our 168 agencies in the United States
and  Canada  were  visited  65  million  times  by  an  estimated  21.7  million  household
members, who donated items.

Incentives  to  increase  the  amount  of  electronics  recycled  and  thus  decrease  the

amount of electronics that are sent to landfills include:

1) Ensure  that  municipalities  have  convenient  collection  sites  that  are  open
year  round.  Nationwide,  Goodwill  has  over  2,100  retail  stores  and  4,100  at-
tended  donation  centers  that  could  potentially  serve  as  the  backbone  for  a
national  collection  infrastructure  for  the  convenient  collection  and  reuse  of
unwanted electronic products.

2) Increase public outreach and education about how to recycle electronic prod-

ucts.

3) Create  disincentives,  such  as  a  zxccb  nationwide  landfill  ban,  for  disposing

electronic products in landfills.

4) Offer  incentives  that  lead  electronic  manufacturers  to  develop  partnerships
with  community-based  organizations  to  collect  and  reuse  their  unwanted
products from consumers.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Renee  St.  Denis,  Director  of  Americas  Product  Take-Back  and  Recy-

cling, Hewlett-Packard Company

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. In your testimony you stated the need for R&D into several areas related to elec-
tronic  waste,  including  research  into  applications  for  recycled  materials,  proper
regulatory approaches, and the net climate impact of recycling electronics. What
would  be  the  best  framework  to  implement  these  research  initiatives  and  who
should be involved?

A1. The Federal Government needs to play an active role in supporting research on
key  questions  regarding  the  proper  management  of  used  electronics,  including  the
climate  impacts.  This  will  help  inform  policies  that  will  ensure  that  the  best  envi-
ronmental  outcome  is  achieved  in  the  most  efficient  manner.  To  achieve  this  goal,
the  Federal  Government  should  support  research  at  major  universities  with  exper-
tise on these issues. A broad set of stakeholders—including the electronics industry,
State and local governments, environmental groups, and others—should be engaged
in working with the academic community on these issues. These groups can provide
useful  data,  expertise,  and  insights  in  addressing  these  issues  in  an  efficient  man-
ner.
Q2. How  does  Hewlett-Packard  link  recyclability  and  other  environmental  consider-
ations  to  the  product  design  process?  Are  engineers  with  these  expertises  inte-
grated  into  all  development  teams  or  is  there  a  separate  team  devoted  to  these
issues?

A2. As  stated  in  our  written  testimony,  HP  works  to  create  a  close  link  between
our  product  design  and  recyclability.  HP  established  our  Design  for  Environment
(DfE)  program  in  1992,  and  it  remains  central  to  our  business  strategy  today.  Our
approach to DfE encompasses the entire product life cycle. In addition to considering
important product attributes such as energy efficiency and materials innovation, de-
sign  for  recyclability  (DFR)  is  one  of  our  primary  priorities  for  design  for  the  envi-
ronment. We believe that our experience and expertise in recycling provides an im-
portant  feedback  loop  to  designers  to  design  future  products  so  that  they  can  be
more readily recycled. It is this link between the product design and how it is han-
dled  at  the  end  of  its  life  that  makes  it  important  for  manufacturers  to  remain  en-
gaged throughout the products’ life cycle.

HP’s DFR efforts include using common fasteners and snap-in features and avoid-
ing the use of screws, glues, adhesives and welds where feasible. This makes it easi-
er to dismantle products and to separate and identify different metals and plastics.
The  materials  we  choose  can  also  enhance  recyclability.  For  example,  in  2007  we
introduced  several  notebook  PC  models  with  LED  technology,  eliminating  mercury
fluorescent  tubes  and  making  the  display  screens  easier  to  manage  at  end-of-life.
These  efforts  have  significantly  improved  the  recyclability  of  HP  products,  and  we
are pleased to report the following:

• HP notebook PC products are now more than 90 percent recyclable or recover-
able by weight (as per the definition used in the European Union WEEE reg-
ulations).
• HP printing and imaging products are typically 70 percent to 85 percent recy-
clable  or  recoverable  by  weight  (as  per  the  definition  used  in  the  European
Union WEEE regulations).

We  also  made  great  progress  in  incorporating  recycling  materials  into  our  prod-
ucts.  For  example,  HP  has  engineered  print  cartridges  that  use  recycled  plastic
without  compromising  quality  or  reliability.  We  design  HP  print  cartridges  to  meet
the  needs  of  our  recycling  system  and  incorporate  recycled  material.  Since  we  take
back only our own cartridges, we can be certain about the material content, making
it easier to process exhausted cartridges and reuse the material to manufacture new
ones.  More  than  200  million  cartridges  have  been  manufactured  using  the  process
through 2007. HP used more than five million pounds (2,300 tons) of recycled plastic
in  its  original  HP  inkjet  cartridges  in  2007,  and  the  company  has  committed  to
using twice as much in 2008. HP also uses post-consumer recycled plastic recovered
through  our  return  and  recycling  program  in  the  manufacture  of  original  HP
LaserJet print cartridges. This recycled plastic can represent as much as 25 percent,
by  weight,  of  the  newly  molded  LaserJet  cartridge  housing.  HP  has  also  incor-
porated recycled content into some hardware products. For example, in 2007, we in-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:58 Aug 25, 2008 Jkt 041901 PO 00000 Frm 00076 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\043008\41901 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

troduced  a  speaker  module  made  from  100  percent  post-consumer  recycled  plastics
in all HP Compaq 6500 and 6700 series Notebook PCs.

Each  product  team  in  HP  includes  a  ‘‘product  steward’’  that  is  responsible  for  all
aspects of environmental compliance. This approach enables HP to ensure that envi-
ronmental  considerations  are  taken  into  account  during  the  design  of  HP  products.
Q3. In your testimony you state that Hewlett-Packard’s efforts toward more environ-
mentally  conscious  design  have  resulted  in  ‘‘HP  products  qualifying  for  a  large
number  of  global  eco-labels,  including  EPEAT.’’  As  you  know,  EPEAT  does  not
cover  consumer  electronics,  and  eco-labeling  for  these  types  of  products  in  the
U.S. is limited to the Energy Star program. Do HP consumer products favorably
qualify  for  some  of  these  global  eco-labels?  Does  HP  believe  that  these  labels  ef-
fectively  educate  consumers  about  products’  environmental  attributes  and  that
educating consumers in this manner will result in increased U.S. sales for more
environmentally sound products?

A3. HP  has  a  long  history  of  promoting  environmentally  sound  design.  As  a  result
of  these  design  initiatives,  HP  offers  a  range  of  products  -  both  for  consumers  and
businesses—that  comply  with  global  eco-labels.  See  http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/
globalcitizenship/environment/productdesign/ecolabels.html.

HP  believes  that  educating  customers  on  the  environmental  attributes  of  the
products they buy can play a significant role in shaping purchasing behavior. How-
ever, eco-labels are only one means of achieving this goal. Information on a product
web-site,  for  example,  can  be  a  more  efficient  way  of  informing  customers  than  a
physical label, and the glue used on some labels can add to the complexity and cost
of  recycling  electronic  products.  Companies  should  have  flexibility  in  choosing  the
manner  they  communicate  to  customers.  In  this  regard,  we  note  that  EPEAT  does
not require a physical label to be affixed to the product, and that Energy Star only
recently mandated the labeling of products as a requirement of this program.

HP  recently  announced  a  new  initiative  to  provide  additional  information  on  the
environmental attributes of HP products. HP will begin using a ‘‘HP Eco-Highlights’’
label on new product packaging, web sites, and data sheets to help customers better
understand  the  environmental  attributes  of  the  product,  such  as  energy  consump-
tion and recycled content.
Q4. You  state  in  your  testimony  that  HP  has  established  the  goals  of  doubling  the
use  of  recycled  plastics  in  printer  cartridges  in  2008  and  eliminating  the  use  of
materials  that  contain  brominated  flame  retardants  and  polyvinyl  chloride.
What are the challenges your company faces to reaching these goals?

A4. Incorporating greater amounts of recycled content and phasing out specific ma-
terials  each  pose  distinct  challenges.  The  challenge  of  using  more  recycled  content
presents  a  classic  ‘‘chicken  or  the  egg’’  dilemma.  Our  desire  to  use  more  recycled
content is hindered by the limited availability of suitable materials, and the supply
of  suitable  materials  is  limited  by  insufficient  demand.  Despite  this  problem,  we
have succeeded in using more than five million pounds (2,300 tons) of recycled plas-
tic  in  its  original  HP  inkjet  cartridges  in  2007,  and  the  company  has  committed  to
using twice as much in 2008. HP also uses post-consumer recycled plastic recovered
through  our  return  and  recycling  program  in  the  manufacture  of  original  HP
LaserJet print cartridges. This recycled plastic can represent as much as 25 percent,
by weight, of the newly molded LaserJet cartridge housing.

The  challenge  of  phasing  out  polyvinyl  chloride  (PVC)  is  complicated  by  the  lack
of  suitable  alternatives  for  some  uses  of  this  material.  Our  goal  is  to  eliminate  all
remaining uses PVC from new computing products as technologically feasible alter-
natives  become  readily  available.  To  be  accepted,  alternatives  also  must  not  com-
promise  product  performance  or  quality  or  adversely  impact  health  or  the  environ-
ment. We expect to achieve this goal for new computing products launched in 2009.
An important component of HP’s materials substitution efforts is determining that
replacement  substances  have  a  lower  environmental  and  health  impact  than  the
substances  identified  for  possible  phase-out.  Many  potential  replacement  materials
are  still  being  evaluated  for  environmental  and  health  impacts.  Unfortunately,
standard  methods  to  perform  these  evaluations  do  not  exist,  and  as  a  result  dif-
fering  conclusions  are  sometimes  drawn  from  the  same  study.  To  address  this  con-
cern,  HP  engages  with  government  agencies,  such  as  the  United  States  Environ-
mental  Protection  Agency,  and  nongovernmental  organizations,  such  as  Clean  Pro-
duction  Action,  to  develop  standard  methods  for  evaluating  the  environmental  and
health impacts of new substances.
Q5. In  his  testimony,  Dr.  Eric  Williams  mentioned  several  applications  for  using
radio frequency identification (RFID) tags in the management of end-of-life elec-

tronics.  From  the  producer’s  perspective,  what  might  the  advantages  and  dis-
advantages be in using RFID technology to manage used electronics?

A5. HP  has  played  a  leadership  role  in  the  development  and  deployment  of  RFID
technology. We are currently using this technology to track product inventory, mon-
itor customer returns and improve product quality, and other uses.

We agree with Dr. Williams that RFID technology could potentially play a useful
role  in  helping  to  manage  end-of-life  electronics.  It  is  possible  that  the  tags  could
help recyclers identify the material composition of products, identify components re-
quiring special handling (e.g., batteries), and other issues.

Certain  issues  need  to  be  addressed  before  RFID  technology  could  be  employed
on  a  large  scale  for  managing  used  electronics.  First,  the  cost  of  RFID  tags  are  an
obstacle,  and  it  remains  unclear  whether  the  benefits  of  using  this  technology  out-
weigh these added costs. Second, the current recycling infrastructure lacks the capa-
bility  to  read  RFID  tags  and  make  use  of  the  potentially  valuable  information  on
the  tags.  Finally,  some  consumer  groups  have  raised  concerns  regarding  potential
privacy issues associated with the use of these tags on consumer products.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. Does  Hewlett-Packard  currently  publish  the  life  cycle  energy  costs  for  all  HP
products?  If  not,  would  you  consider  providing  such  information  to  consumers
in the future?

recently 

A1. HP  currently  publishes  a  considerable  amount  of  information  on  the  environ-
mental  and  energy  attributes  of  HP  products.  See  http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/
globalcitizenship/environment/productdesign/products.html.  HP 
an-
nounced a new initiative to provide additional information on the environmental at-
tributes  of  HP  products.  HP  will  begin  using  a  ‘‘HP  Eco-Highlights’’  label  on  new
product  packaging,  web  sites,  and  data  sheets  to  help  customers  better  understand
the  environmental  attributes  of  the  product,  such  as  energy  consumption  and  recy-
cled content.

We do not publish ‘‘life cycle energy costs’’ for HP products at this time. HP prod-
ucts  are  comprised  of  thousands  of  parts,  components,  and  materials,  provided  by
a  complex  array  of  suppliers  located  around  the  world.  This  supply  chain  consists
of  many  levels  or  steps  that  contribute  to  the  final  product.  It  would  be  a  hugely
complex  undertaking  to  calculate  the  ‘‘life  cycle  energy  costs’’  of  the  final  product,
and  there  is  currently  no  generally  accepted  way  of  collecting  this  data  and  calcu-
lating  the  net  energy  impacts.  HP  is  working  within  the  international  standards
bodies  to  devise  ways  of  improving  the  way  such  information  is  provided  to  con-
sumers.  We  would  consider  publishing  the  ‘‘life  cycle  energy  costs’’  for  HP  products
once  there  were  a  clear  methodology  for  doing  so  and  if  there  were  better  ways  of
compiling the data in a standardized way.

Even  in  the  absence  of  publishing  this  information,  HP  has  made  great  strides
in  reducing  the  overall  energy  impacts  of  our  products  at  every  stage  in  the  life
cycle.  In  our  own  operations,  HP  is  on  track  to  achieve  a  16  percent  reduction  in
our  energy  consumption  of  our  operations  by  2010  from  2005  levels.  We  are  also
working with our suppliers around the world to reduce the energy consumed by the
manufacturing, distribution, and packaging of our products. Finally, we are continu-
ously achieving significant improvements in the efficiency of our products during the
‘‘use’’  stage  by  the  consumer.  For  example,  we  have  set  a  goal  of  reducing  by  the
energy  consumption  of  volume  desktop  and  notebook  computer  families  by  25  per-
cent by 2010 compared with 2005 levels.
Q2. What  are  the  liability  concerns  for  companies  that  take-back  electronics  and
reuse or recycle them? Does liability for damages to workers from exposure dur-
ing  recycling  or  liability  for  harm  caused  by  refurbished  equipment  limit  the
growth of take back programs?

A2. HP  takes  seriously  its  responsibility  to  recycle  our  products  in  an  environ-
mentally  sound  manner,  including  the  protection  of  workers  involved  in  the  recy-
cling process. In addition to our obligations as a leading corporate citizen, HP seeks
to  limit  any  liability  that  we  may  incur  as  a  result  of  our  recycling  operations.  To
achieve this result, HP requires our recycling vendors to comply with HP’s Supplier
Code  of  Conduct,  and  we  monitor  compliance  through  site  audits.  See  http://
www.hp.com/hpinfo/globalcitizenship/gcreport/productreuse/
recyclingapproach.html.  While  there  is  an  added  cost  to  recycling  in  an  environ-
mentally sound manner, we believe that there are cost avoidance benefits associated
with doing so.

Q3. Most major manufacturers claim that they do not ship e-waste oversees for recy-
cling. Where does the e-waste found in environmentally unsound recycling oper-
ations originate?

A3. HP  has  a  longstanding  practice  of  ensuring  that  products  and  materials  from
our  U.S.  recycling  programs  are  not  shipped  overseas  (i.e.,  outside  the  U.S.  and
Canada)  for  processing.  Unfortunately,  there  are  numerous  other  entities  involved
in  the  collection  and  recycling  of  used  electronics  that  simply  serve  as  ‘‘waste  bro-
kers’’  and  sell  discarded  products  to  others,  or  ‘‘sham’’  recyclers  who  simply  utilize
some profitable parts or materials and sell the rest. Thus, it appears the most mate-
rials found in the developing world that is subject to environmentally unsound prac-
tices  originates  from  waste  collectors,  brokers,  or  ‘‘recyclers’’—including  municipal
and other governments—that do not manage their materials properly.

According  to  a  recent  article  in  National  Geographic  Magazine,  much  of  the  im-
properly  managed  e-waste  in  the  developing  world  originates  with  local  collection
events in the U.S. by municipalities or so-called ‘‘recyclers’’:

Currently,  less  than  20  percent  of  e-waste  entering  the  solid  waste  stream  is
channeled  through  companies  that  advertise  themselves  as  recyclers,  though
the  number  is  likely  to  rise  as  states  like  California  crack  down  on  landfill
dumping. Yet recycling, under the current system, is less benign than it sounds.
Dropping your old electronic gear off with a recycling company or at a municipal
collection point does not guarantee that it will be safely disposed of. While some
recyclers  process  the  material  with  an  eye  toward  minimizing  pollution  and
health  risks,  many  more  sell  it  to  brokers  who  ship  it  to  the  developing  world,
where environmental enforcement is weak. For people in countries on the front
end of this arrangement, it’s a handy out-of-sight, out-of-mind solution.

Q4. Your testimony highlights how HP is investing significantly in your ‘‘Design for
Environment’’  and  take-back  campaigns.  However,  due  to  the  storied  history  of
your  company  you  have  a  long  tail  of  legacy  waste  as  well.  Does  HP  have  a
strategy  for  dealing  with  legacy  waste  or  suggestions  for  the  Committee  on  how
best to tackle this problem?

(January 

2008) 

A4. HP  has  been  implementing  and  expanding  its  recycling  strategy  for  nearly  20
years.  Since  1987,  HP  has  successfully  collected  and  recycled  more  than  one  billion
pounds  of  used  or  unwanted  computer-related  equipment  globally.  With  our  vast
knowledge  and  experience,  HP’s  goal  is  to  recycle  an  additional  one  billion  pounds
of  equipment  (for  a  total  of  two  billion  pounds  worldwide)  by  the  end  of  2010.  HP
has  established  a  recycling  service  throughout  the  U.S.  (as  well  as  other  countries
around the world) that provides consumer and commercial customers with a conven-
ient  opportunity  to  recycle  their  old  products  in  an  environmentally  sound  manner.
For more information on HP’s environment and broader global citizenship activities,
see: http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/globalcitizenship/.

HP  currently  partners  with  operators  of  seven  large,  state-of-the-art  recycling  fa-
cilities  in  the  U.S.  and  Canada,  as  well  as  operating  our  own  technologically-ad-
vanced facility used to recycled print supplies. Our recycling facility for printer sup-
plies  is  located  outside  of  Nashville,  Tennessee.  This  facility  consists  of  a  40,000
square foot building, including separation and recycling technology. The facility em-
ploys  approximately  50  full  time  employees  and  processes  all  of  the  material  re-
turned to HP through our different print supplies programs in the U.S., Canada and
Latin America.
Q5. Can  you  describe  for  us  how  the  current  system  of  print  supply  recycling  came
to  be?  What  obstacles  or  successes  have  characterized  this  system  and  can  be
translated to the broader e-waste problem?

A5. HP recognized early on that print supplies posed unique recycling opportunities
and  challenges,  and  we  promptly  took  steps  to  provide  customers  with  a  solution
for  their  recycling  needs.  Unlike  computer  hardware  products  that  can  be  used  for
many  years,  print  supplies  are  ‘‘consumables’’  that  are  used  for  a  more  limited  pe-
riod.  In  the  absence  of  a  convenient  recycling  system,  many  of  these  print  supplies
would  be  disposed.  To  avoid  this  result,  and  given  the  relatively  small  size  and
weight  of  these  products,  HP  determined  that  these  products  could  be  readily
shipped through the mail or other shipping services to a recycling facility. HP recog-
nized  that  customers  wished  to  avoid  disposing  of  these  products,  so  HP  developed
a simple product return system that has been in place for almost two decades. Many

of  our  new  print  supplies  come  with  a  return  envelope  or  label  that  allows  cus-
tomers  to  return  their  products  quickly  and  easily.  HP  is  also  expanding  its  recy-
cling  offering  by  partnering  with  retailers  to  allow  customers  to  drop-off  their  used
cartridges. Once HP receives the used cartridge, HP recovers plastics that are then
used  in  the  production  of  new  products.  Other  materials,  such  as  metals,  are  recy-
cled and made available on the commodity markets for use in other products.

The  success  of  our  recycling  system  for  pint  supplies  demonstrates  the  viability
of  cost-effective,  market-based  systems  for  recycling  used  products.  However,  each
product  category  necessitates  a  tailored  approach.  Just  as  the  collection  and  recy-
cling  system  for  other  common  recyclables—such  as  appliances,  tires,  car  batteries,
and others—are each different, the system established for computers, TVs, or other
electronic  products  may  likely  be  different  than  the  system  of  returning  used  print
supplies  through  the  mail.  In  addition,  print  supplies  use  a  limited  number  of  dif-
ferent types of plastics that makes recycling more feasible, many hardware products
use  a  complex  assortment  of  types  of  plastics  that  adds  to  the  cost  and  complexity
of recycling.

Questions submitted by Representative Daniel Lipinski
Q1. In  2006,  the  Government  Accountability  Office  estimated  that  more  than  100
million  computers,  TVs,  and  monitors  are  thrown  away  each  year.  In  addition,
the EPA estimates that electronic waste is growing two to three times faster than
any other waste stream. Yet presently, there is no specific federal law or regula-
tion  governing  the  disposal  of  consumer  electronic  products  in  the  U.S.  Should
there be?

A1. HP has long supported the adoption of federal e-recycling legislation as a means
of  encouraging  harmonized  national  approaches  to  the  challenge  of  e-recycling.
Other major markets, including the EU and Japan, have adopted legislation on this
topic,  and  we  believe  it  is  appropriate  for  the  U.S.  to  act  as  well.  In  the  absence
of  federal  legislation  a  growing  number  of  states  have  enacted  their  own  laws.  But
the emerging patchwork of divergent State laws does not serve the interests of envi-
ronmental  protection  and  needlessly  increases  costs.  HP  believes  that  federal  legis-
lation is needed to establish a more efficient, effective harmonized national system.
Q2. The  EPA  estimates  that  at  most,  only  15  percent  of  products  at  the  end  of  their
useful  lives  reach  a  recycling  or  reuse  program.  This  does  not  come  as  a  shock
to me. In fact, it might seem a little high given the impediments that consumers
currently face.

A2. The  15  percent  figure  is  consistent  with  the  results  of  HP’s  recycling  program
and  reflects  the  challenges  of  influencing  consumer  behavior.  Including  remarketed
equipment,  we  achieved  a  total  reuse  and  recycling  rate  in  2007  of  15  percent  of
relevant  hardware  sales.  We  cannot  assess  the  accuracy  of  this  number  for  other
manufacturers.
Q2a. First, how are average consumers to know what to do with their e-waste when

it comes to the end of its useful life?

A2a. Recycling  opportunities  for  average  consumers  typically  vary  by  product  cat-
egory  and  locality.  This  is  likely  to  be  the  situation  for  e-recycling  as  well.  Under
the State programs currently in place, the options on the ground for consumers vary
in terms of drop-off at retail establishments, municipal collection sites, one-day col-
lection  events,  or  other  collection  mechanisms.  Consumers  typically  become  aware
of  these  opportunities  by  company  or  government  websites  or  local  advertising.
Given  that  consumers  will  only  look  for  these  recycling  opportunities  on  an  infre-
quent basis, this approach is probably appropriate.
Q2b. This  past  weekend,  Washington,  D.C.  held  an  e-waste  recycling  day.  Over  ten
times  as  many  residents  as  last  year  showed  to  recycle  their  gadgets,  leading
to over two hours wait time. The incentives to recycle just don’t seem to be there
right now. What do you recommend be done to fix this problem?

A2b. The  significant  wait  time  for  consumers  at  local  collection  events  is  relatively
common,  particularly  when  it  is  a  one-time  event.  Consumers  may  have  a  number
of used devices in storage and they are looking for an opportunity to recycle a num-
ber of these devices at once. We believe that this ‘‘backlog’’ will dissipate once collec-
tion opportunities increase in frequency and convenience, as consumers find outlets
for the devices they currently have in storage. Legislation can play a significant role
in  achieving  this  outcome.  Legislation  should  establish  a  framework  to  create  a
more frequent and available system of collection points or events.

Q3. The  European  Union  is  often  ahead  of  the  United  States  when  it  comes  to  the
issue  of  recycling.  Where  do  U.S.  capabilities  stand  as  compared  to  Europe  on
the topic of e-waste?

A3. The electronics recycling infrastructure is better developed in Europe than it is
in  the  U.S.  In  most  countries,  collection  of  products  is  facilitated  by  municipal  gov-
ernments  and  retailers,  thereby  creating  an  efficient  and  convenient  way  for  con-
sumers to drop off unwanted products. Also, there are a larger number of recycling
vendors  to  conduct  recycling  operations  in  an  environmentally  sound  manner.  HP
played  a  leading  role  in  the  development  of  a  consortium  of  companies  to  conduct
recycling  operations.  For  more  information,  see  www.erp-recycling.org.  HP  is  work-
ing  to  develop  the  recycling  infrastructure  in  the  U.S.  as  well  by  partnering  with
leading  metals  recyclers,  developing  technologies,  and  auditing  outside  vendors  to
ensure compliance with environmental and other requirements.

Questions submitted by Representative Bob Inglis
Q1. Many manufacturers support a national solution to deal with e-waste; a federal
law  that  would  preempt  the  patchwork  of  State  and  local  laws  that  are  begin-
ning  to  crop  up.  Are  there  any  aspects  of  those  State  laws  that  would/should
be  expanded  to  the  national  level?  What  provisions  of  State  laws  in  place  now
would be detrimental to efforts dealing with e-waste if ramped up to a national
scale? Can you give an example or two of each?

A1. The costs of the emerging patchwork of State recycling laws will impose signifi-
cant  overall  costs  on  companies.  A  study  by  the  National  Electronics  Recycling  In-
frastructure  Clearinghouse  (NERIC)  has  estimated  the  manufacturer  compliance
costs  in  2010  for  all  14  jurisdictions  having  enacted  mandatory  e-waste  financing
requirements.  According  to  the  study,  even  if  no  other  State  or  local  legislation  is
passed, the NCER estimates that manufacturers will spend approximately $71 mil-
lion  in  2010  to  comply  with  the  U.S.  patchwork  of  State  e-waste  mandates.  See
www.ecyclingresource.org. This emerging patchwork of differing State laws is adding
significant new costs and impeding the development of an efficient nationwide infra-
structure, while creating the potential for consumer confusion. A consistent national
approach is necessary and appropriate.

A major goal of federal e-recycling legislation should be the achievement of a high
degree of harmonization among the states and the elimination of unnecessary dupli-
cate  activities.  Manufacturers  of  covered  products  are  currently  facing  a  variety  of
State  laws  that  have  differing  approaches,  product  scope,  and  administrative  re-
quirements.  These  inconsistent  State  programs  do  not  improve  environmental  out-
comes,  but  instead  simply  add  complexity  and  cost.  Driving  greater  consistency
among the State programs should be a key priority of federal legislation.

An important area that demands greater consistency is laws and regulations gov-
erning collection and transport of discarded electronics. As long as even a few states
interpret  their  authority  as  allowing  them  to  impose  their  own  requirements  on
interstate  transport  of  these  discarded  products,  be  they  requirements  to  transport
the  products  as  hazardous  wastes  or  some  other  special  classification,  and  these
products must be transported to recycling centers through these states, efforts to de-
velop  a  national  recycling  system  will  be  stymied.  The  State  of  Maine  is  one  exam-
ple  of  a  state  acting  to  impose  unique  requirements  for  certain  discarded  electronic
products.  In  various  cases,  Maine  regulation  requires  shippers  to  use  a  hazardous
waste  manifest  or  shipping  papers  similar  to  a  hazardous  waste  manifest,  and  to
use  transporters  with  special  plans  and  programs  in  place.  In  our  experience,  we
have  found  it  to  be  extremely  difficult  to  find  interstate  transporters  prepared  to
meet Maine’s unique requirements. For these and other reasons, we currently do not
offer one of our hardware take back programs in the State of Maine. [Optional: We
do  retain  a  recycling  company  nearby  to  Maine  that  operates  their  own  transport
vehicles  to  meet  legislated  take  back  obligations  in  Maine,  but  we  do  not  have  the
same  flexibility  as  in  various  other  states  to  hire  any  common  carrier  to  transport
products to our various chosen recycling contractors. If we wished to, we would have
to attempt to have the local recycler collect the material and take it to a neighboring
state, then transfer the load to a common carrier there to enable it to be transported
to one of our more distant U.S. recyclers managing large volumes for us.]

Another  approach  adopted  in  one  state—California—that  would  be  detrimental  if
expanded  would  be  the  imposition  of  point-of-sale  fees  on  the  sale  of  new  products
to finance the recycling of old products. Fortunately, California is the only state that
has adopted that approach. Our experience and data from other recycling programs
indicate that these fees (which are, in fact, taxes) result in higher overall costs than
producer  responsibility  models  that  enable  innovation  and  incentives  for  efficiency.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Eric  Harris,  Associate  Counsel/Director  of  Government  and  Inter-

national Affairs, Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. In  your  testimony  you  mentioned  the  need  for  research  and  development  into
new markets for plastic and glass, and recycling technologies for plastics. What
would  be  the  best  mechanism  to  fund  and  prioritize  this  research?  What  would
be the best mechanism to facilitate technology transfer to the recycling industry?
A1. It  would  seem  that  the  best  means  to  fund  and  prioritize  plastic  and  glass  re-
search would be to include in the Appropriations Interior, Environment, and Related
Agencies  bill  an  appropriation  directed  to  the  U.S.  EPA  Office  of  Research  and  De-
velopment.

The  research  and  development  for  new  markets  and  technology  related  to  glass
and plastic would assist manufacturers in developing new technologies and uses for
recyclable  materials.  And  it  would  make  more  efficient  existing  uses  of  recyclable
materials in the manufacturing process. Subsequently, manufacturers would develop
additional  requirements  to  utilize  the  recyclable  material  in  their  manufacturing
processes.
Q2. You mention the difficulties associated with recycling the leaded glass from cath-
ode ray tube televisions and monitors. Are there end-of-life challenges associated
with flat panel displays? Is there a market for this glass?

A2. Yes.  The  new  technology  in  flat  screen  displays  utilizes  a  system  of  cylindrical
lamps that contain mercury powder. These mercury lamps are very time consuming
and costly to remove or replace, which also makes these products difficult to recycle.
The  Institute  of  Scrap  Recycling  Industries  Inc.,  (ISRI)  has  long  advocated  work-
ing  with  manufactures  to  design  their  products  to  be  easily  recycled  at  the  end  of
their  useful  lives,  including  eliminating  hazardous,  toxic  constituents,  or  creating
other impediments that can hinder the recycling of those products. Design for Recy-
cling  (an  ISRI  program  established  to  encourage  manufacturers  in  all  industries
to design their products, from the outset, with recycling in mind) will help to avoid
these additional costs and improve recycling efficiency.

The  best  market  for  flat  panel  screens  and  cathode  ray  tubes  is  resell.  In  today’s
market, the resell value for flat panel displays is strong. Similar to the lead in cath-
ode  ray  tubes,  the  mercury  in  the  flat  panel  screens  reduces  the  cost  effectiveness
of processing flat panel displays.
Q3. Now  that  producers  are  designing  products  to  eliminate  hazardous  substances
under  Europe’s  Restriction  on  Hazardous  Substances  (RoHS)  Directive,  what
more needs to be done to increase product recyclability?

A3. Rather than prescriptive changes, ISRI suggests that more collaborative oppor-
tunities are needed to think through some of these design issues before these prod-
ucts  reach  the  market.  For  example,  EPEAT  is  an  electronic  product  design  stand-
ard  adopted  by  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  that  has  been  very  successful
in the marketplace. Most major computer manufacturers are using EPEAT as their
measure  of  environmental  product  design,  and  are  competing  to  gain  additional
credits  from  EPEAT  by  going  beyond  what  other  OEMs  have  done.  For  example,
some  manufacturers  have  incorporated  significant  amounts  of  recycled  plastic  in
their  products.  This  creates  an  increased  demand  for  recycled  plastics  from  com-
puters.  Additional  programs  could  be  encouraged  by  the  Congress  such  as  the
EPEAT program.
Q4. You  mention  in  your  testimony  that  the  recycling  industry  has  called  upon  pro-
ducers  to  adopt  a  Design  for  Recycling  philosophy  but  thus  far  they  have  met
with only limited success. How do recyclers presently engage with electronic pro-
ducers? Are there other industries with stronger partnerships that the electronics
industry  could  learn  from?  Is  there  evidence  from  the  electronics  industry,  or
other industries, which shows producers will design products for easier recycling
if  they  are  financially  or  physically  responsible  for  the  product  at  the  end  of  its
life?

A4. Recyclers  have  had  some  success  working  with  electronics  manufacturers  re-
garding design issues but such interactions have been limited.
ISRI  has  presented  its  Design  for  Recycling  award  to  HP  for  its  leadership  in
designing  its  products  for  recycling.  Certainly,  HP  is  a  good  example  of  a  manufac-

80

turer  that  promotes  producer  responsibility  and  is  committed  to  Design  for  Recy-
cling because it makes good environmental and economic sense.

Another example focuses on the use of mercury switches in the automobile indus-
try.  That  industry  began  to  use  convenience  light  switches  and  ABS  brake  sensors
that  contained  mercury.  Because  of  concerns  about  the  hazards  of  mercury,  espe-
cially  to  children  and  pregnant  women,  most  non-American  auto  makers  ended  the
use  of  mercury-containing  switches  in  vehicles  in  1993.  The  American  manufactur-
ers,  however,  continued  to  use  mercury  switches  in  vehicles  built  for  the  American
market—until 2003. It was then that various states began requiring the removal of
mercury  switches  from  end-of-life  vehicles  at  the  expense  of  the  manufacturers.
That  economic  disincentive  caused  the  auto  makers  to  end  the  use  of  mercury
switches and to seek a national program to support such switch removal.

Some  years  ago,  ISRI  worked  with  the  Association  of  Home  Appliance  Industries
(AHAM)  to  eliminate  the  use  of  cadmium  paints  in  the  manufacture  of  new  appli-
ances. Cadmium is a hazardous substance. And, ISRI works with the Vehicle Recy-
cling  Partnership  (VRP),  an  entity  created  by  the  American  auto  manufacturers  to
develop  ways  and  means  to  increase  a  vehicle’s  overall  recyclability.  In  addition  to
ISRI  and  the  auto  manufacturers,  other  VRP  participants  are  the  auto  dismantlers
and the steel industry.
Q5. You  state  in  your  testimony  that  export  of  electronics  can  be  safe  and  is  an  im-
portant  part  of  the  recycling  industry.  You  also  mention  that  in  places  like
China  there  are  legitimate  and  responsible  recyclers.  How  should  we  close  the
loop on used electronics shipped overseas so that once they reach true end-of-life
they are handled by legitimate recyclers?

A5. In  today’s  market,  buyers  and  brokers  around  the  world  are  paying  for  scrap
electronics as compared to recyclers in the U.S. having to charge to recycle the same
material.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  some  electronic  equipment,  such  as  monitors
and  televisions,  has  a  net-negative  cost  to  recycle;  that  is,  the  costs  outweigh  the
value  of  recoverable  material.  However,  at  the  same  time,  there  is  a  thriving  reuse
market  outside  of  the  United  States  that  allows  foreign  buyers  to  pay  a  premium
for monitors and TVs.

ISRI advocates recognizing and giving contractual preferences to responsible recy-
clers  anywhere  in  the  world  that  can  demonstrate  that  they  are  ‘legitimate’  recy-
clers.  In  fact,  for  the  past  two  years  ISRI  has  represented  electronics  recyclers  in
a  multi-stakeholder  process  to  develop  responsible  recycling  practices  (R2)  for  elec-
tronics recyclers. The Environmental Protection Agency has convened and facilitated
this effort. Once completed, ISRI intends to incorporate this set of specific perform-
ance practices into its Recycling Industry Operating Standard (RIOS) for electronics
recyclers.

ISRI  developed  RIOS  as  an  integrated  management  system  standard  designed
specifically  for  the  scrap  recycling  industry  and  the  ANSI–ASQ  National  Accredita-
tion  Board  will  oversee  the  third  party  registrars  who  will  audit  recyclers.  It  pro-
vides  electronic  recyclers  with  an  affordable  tool  to  monitor  their  quality,  environ-
mental,  health  and  safety  goals.  Few  industries  worldwide  have  endeavored  to  un-
dertake  such  a  huge  step,  but  the  recycling  industry  in  the  United  States  has  al-
ways been, and intends to remain, the global leader in recycling technology, environ-
mental protection, worker safety and the production of high quality materials. RIOS
plus  R2  are  tools  for  recyclers  to  accomplish  those  goals.  This  will  help  to  build
needed  confidence  in  the  market  place  and  reward  responsible  recyclers  that  are
willing  to  be  audited  to  a  set  of  requirements  in  an  open  and  transparent  process.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. What  are  the  liability  concerns  for  companies  that  take-back  electronics  and
reuse or recycle them? Does liability for damages to workers from exposure dur-
ing  recycling  or  liability  for  harm  caused  by  refurbished  equipment  limit  the
growth of take-back programs?

A1. As with any business decision, there is always some risk associated with choos-
ing  strategic  business  partners.  However,  companies  can  dramatically  reduce  their
potential  risks  associated  with  recycling  electronic  equipment  (like  re-selling  hard
drives with sensitive data or mismanaging material like mercury, batteries or lead-
ed  glass)  by  selecting  a  recycler  that  correlates  to  their  risk  tolerance.  Companies
need  to  educate  themselves  as  to  the  differences  of  recyclers  on  the  market.  There
is a wide disparity of services being offered from a wide variety of recyclers. As with
other  prudent  business  decisions,  conducting  appropriate  due  diligence  and  then

81

contracting  with  a  responsible  recycler  based  on  individual  needs  can  significantly
reduce if not eliminate a companies potential liabilities.
Q2. How has electronics in the waste stream changed over the past decade and what
predictions  can  we  make  about  changes  in  the  coming  years?  How  do  these
changes  affect  our  ability  to  safely  and  efficiently  recycle  or  reuse  these  devices?
A2. The  precious  metal  quantities  have  decreased  on  a  per  unit  basis,  which  has
decreased the per unit recoverable value of electronic equipment. However, the over-
all  volumes  have  increased.  Recyclers  are  simply  seeing  more  electronic  equipment
coming into their facilities. The biggest challenges are finding end-markets for lead-
ed glass and mixed-plastic resin.

Another  emerging  challenge  is  smelting  capacity.  Globally,  the  lead  and  precious
metal  smelters  are  quickly  running  out  of  capacity  to  recover  the  world’s  growing
supply of electronic scrap. For example, there are only two major lead smelters left
in  North  America.  Lack  of  smelting  capacity  could  significantly  impact  the  sustain-
ability of this market.
Q3. Most major manufacturers claim they do not ship e-waste overseas for recycling.
Where  does  the  e-waste  found  in  environmentally  unsound  recycling  operations
originate?

A3. As  scrap  commodities  and  new  and  used  electronic  equipment  is  traded  glob-
ally,  the  material  is  being  generated  from  all  over  the  world,  which  includes  from
the importing countries themselves. For example, China and Southeast Asian coun-
tries  are  the  largest  growth  markets  to  sell  new  and  used  electronic  equipment.
Once  that  equipment  reaches  its  end-of-life,  artisan  communities  are  purchasing
and processing that material as well as material imported from developed countries.
Since  demand  is  so  high,  Asian  brokers  are  able  to  pay  more  for  the  obsolete  elec-
tronic equipment than in Europe and the United States. Thus, countries like China
continue  to  purchase  obsolete  electronic  equipment  from  countries  all  over  the
world, including the United States.
Q4. In your testimony you state that, ‘‘electronics recycling yielded approximately 1.3
billion pounds of recyclable materials’’ in 2006. How much of this material was
subsequently used as raw manufacturing inputs?

A4. ISRI asserts that most, if not all, of the 1.3 billion pounds is absorbed back into
the manufacturing process.
Q5. You state that much collected equipment has a net-negative cost to recycle. What
are  some  examples  of  goods  that  generally  cannot  be  recycled  efficiently?  How
much of the current electronic waste stream is comprised of these goods?

A5. Unlike  central  processing  units  that  yield  a  positive  value  of  around  10  cents
a  pound  and  can  be  resold  as  a  usable  device  for  $50–$70  dollars,  and  99  percent
of laptops that are resold in their entirety and yield between $300 and $550 a unit,
most  electronics  recyclers  must  charge  their  customers  to  recycle  televisions  and
monitors containing cathode ray tubes (CRTs) to off-set the negative costs. Recyclers
generally charge between 20–30 cents a pound, relative to truckload bulk equations
for televisions and monitors with CRTs.

Televisions and monitors with cathode ray tubes pose the biggest challenge to mu-
nicipal  landfills  and  for-profit  recyclers.  The  hard  reality  is  that  many  consumers
are  not  prepared  or  willing  to  pay  an  additional  fee  to  responsibly  recycle  their  old
TVs and monitors.

It  is  worth  mentioning  that  experts  estimate  that  30  percent  of  Americans  cur-
rently throw televisions in the garbage (permitted under existing federal law) rather
than  recycle  or  donating  them.  That  is  the  equivalent  of  67,698,877  televisions.  By
recycling  those  televisions,  according  to  the  EPA’s  WARM  model1 environmental
benefits calculator, 753,072.68 metric tons of carbon equivalents would be prevented
from entering the atmosphere.
Q6. What  are  the  most  difficult  components  to  safely  and  cost-effectively  recycle?
Other witnesses have raised plastics, mercury lamps, and lead content as having
the  potential  to  negatively  affect  environmental  and  public  health.  What  is  the
state-of-the-art for recycling or reuse of these items?

A6. We  would  generally  agree  with  your  aforementioned  list.  Mixed  plastic  resin,
mercury lamps, batteries, and leaded glass are the most difficult items to cost-effec-
tively recycle. However, if responsibly recycled these materials pose little to no risk

to the environment or to public health. Each of these materials are sorted and then
sent to appropriate material recovery facilities. For example, leaded glass is sent to
either  a  glass-to-glass  manufacturer  or  to  a  lead  smelter.  Depending  on  the  quality
of the sort, mixed plastic is either sold to a plastic manufacturer or for energy recov-
ery.  Mercury  lamps  are  sent  to  facilities  that  specialize  in  mercury  recovery  and
then to retort facilities.

Questions submitted by Representative Daniel Lipinski
Q1. In  2006,  the  Government  Accountability  Office  estimated  that  more  than  100
million  computers,  TVs,  and  monitors  are  thrown  away  each  year.  In  addition,
the EPA estimated that electronic waste is growing two to three times faster than
any other waste stream. Yet presently, there is no specific federal law or regula-
tion  governing  the  disposal  of  consumer  electronic  products  in  the  U.S.  Should
there be?

A1. ISRI supports a national solution that promotes a sustainable, market-based re-
cycling  infrastructure.  We  also  support  a  system  that  improves  Design  for  Recy-
cling,  promotes  responsible  recycling  and  allows  the  free  and  fair  trade  of  scrap
commodities globally. ISRI is concerned that a multiplicity of 50 different laws and
regulations will inhibit economies of scale and market efficiencies, thereby hindering
the  development  of  a  sustainable  recycling  infrastructure,  and  slowing  the  develop-
ment of end-use consumer markets for these valuable raw materials.

However,  private  sector  electronics  recyclers  are  already  recycling  under  a  host
of applicable environmental, health and safety, commercial and import/export regu-
lations;  such  as  permitting  requirements  in  the  CAA,  CWA  and  storm  water  provi-
sions,  RCRA  (solid  and  hazardous  wastes  provisions),  OSHA,  more  stringent  State
requirements,  federal  and  State  transportation  laws,  U.S.  export  laws  and  import
requirements  of  foreign  countries,  such  as  those  administered  by  China’s  General
Administration on Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ). We are
doubtful  that  a  set  of  new  regulations  are  needed  to  address  electronics  recycling.
At the same time, we recognize that a few ‘‘sham’’ recyclers may be spoiling the con-
certed efforts of most responsible recyclers to adhere to high standards and applica-
ble law. ISRI asserts that more precise enforcement efforts targeted at ‘‘sham’’ recy-
cling,  and  making  certain  that  governmental  entities  involved  in  electronics  recy-
cling are fully complying with the current statutory and regulatory regime, is more
appropriate than creating new laws and regulations.
Q2. The  EPA  estimates  that  at  most,  only  15  percent  of  products  at  the  end  of  their
useful  lives  reach  a  recycling  or  reuse  program.  This  does  not  come  as  a  shock
to me. In fact, it might seem a little high given the impediments that consumers
currently face.

A2. First,  how  are  average  consumers  to  know  what  to  do  with  e-waste  when  it
comes  to  the  end  of  its  useful  life?  This  past  weekend,  Washington,  D.C.  held  an
e-waste  recycling  day.  Over  ten  times  as  many  residents  as  last  year  showed  up  to
recycle their gadgets, leading to over two hours wait time. The incentives to recycle
just  don’t  seem  to  be  there  right  now.  What  do  you  recommend  be  done  to  fix  this
problem?

One  of  the  primary  benefits  of  having  OEMs  and  retailers  participating  in  pro-
ducer responsibility and take-back programs is their access to consumers. Educating
consumers  about  were  they  can  recycle  their  household  electronics  is  essential  to
furthering  a  sustainable  infrastructure.  Recyclers  do  not  have  the  same  access  to
consumers as do the OEMs and retailers. ISRI strongly believes, for this type of rea-
son, that OEMs, retailers, collectors, transporters and recyclers must work together
to  educate  consumers  in  order  to  utilize  the  existing  reuse/recycling  infrastructure.
As far as incentives, one of the primary challenges is to reeducate the consumers
to  think  of  household  electronic  equipment  as  a  recyclable  and  not  a  waste.  It  is
very important to distinguish between scrap and waste as well as recycling and dis-
posal.  Simply  stated,  scrap  is  the  opposite  of  waste.  Processed  scrap  materials  are
commodities that have a significant value on domestic and international markets as
raw  material  feed  stocks  that  substitute  for  virgin  materials  in  the  manufacture  of
new  basic  materials  such  as  copper,  steel,  and  plastics.  Unlike  scrap,  waste  has  no
value and is typically buried in a landfill.

Electronics  scrap,  like  scrap  paper,  glass,  plastic,  metal,  textiles,  and  rubber,  is
not waste when recycled. Defining scrap electronics as waste undermines and over-
looks  the  value  that  these  electronics  retain,  if  properly  recycled.  Saddling  them
with  the  moniker  of  ‘‘waste’’  imposes  a  whole  host  of  unwarranted  regulatory  bur-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:58 Aug 25, 2008 Jkt 041901 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\043008\41901 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

83

dens  that  will  undermine  the  ability  to  allow  the  recycling  system  to  operate  effec-
tively and efficiently.

ISRI  is  confident  that  making  the  connection  between  recycling  and  climate
change  will  provide  an  extra  incentive  to  recycle  household  goods.  Scrap  recycling
is one of the world’s most climate friendly activities. The use of recycled scrap mate-
rials  to  manufacture  new  products  sustains  the  earth’s  natural  resources,  while  at
the  same  time,  conserves  impressive  amounts  of  energy  in  the  manufacturing  proc-
ess, and thereby significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions from those facilities.
In addition, the market is also responding with new incentive approaches. For ex-
ample,  Sam’s  Club  stores  has  a  program  that  will  allow  consumers  to  redeem  un-
wanted  electronics  for  a  Sam’s  Club  gift  card,  the  value  of  which  is  determined  by
the  quantity  and  quality  of  electronics  traded  in.  These  types  of  programs  coupled
with  the  public’s  desire  to  recycle  more  due  to  climate  change  will  likely  provide
extra incentives into the marketplace.
Q3. The  European  Union  is  often  ahead  of  the  United  States  when  it  comes  to  the
issue  of  recycling.  Where  do  U.S.  capabilities  stand  as  compared  to  Europe  on
the topic of e-waste?

A3. ISRI is perplexed by the notion that the European Union is presumably ‘‘ahead
of  the  United  States’’  when  it  comes  to  recycling.  In  the  minds  of  many,  recycling
in the United States is a phenomenon that began in the 1970’s following the original
Earth  Day  celebration.  For  others,  awareness  dates  to  the  late  1980’s  following  the
infamous voyage of the ‘‘garbage barge’’ and the ensuing fears that landfill capacity
had  reached  a  crisis  stage.  It  may  interest  the  Committee  to  know  that  the  scrap
recycling industry actually dates back to the beginnings of our nation, when a stat-
ue  of  King  George  III  was  toppled  in  NYC  and  its  metal  was  used  to  make  bullets
for  the  Continental  Army.  Our  members  are  in  the  business  of  recycling,  and  have
formed the basis of the established recycling infrastructure that exists in this coun-
try today.

ISRI  is  now  the  largest  trade  association  of  recyclers  throughout  the  world.  With
approximately  1,500  member  companies  that  process,  broker  and  industrially  con-
sume scrap commodities, including metals, paper, plastics, glass, rubber, electronics
and  textiles.  Our  members  operate  at  over  3,000  locations  in  the  United  States
alone.  More  than  20  percent  of  ISRI’s  membership  is  involved  in  electronic  scrap
processing and industrial consumption of scrap material generated by electronics re-
cyclers.  In  2007,  the  domestic  industry  manufactured  approximately  $71  billion  of
specification grade commodities that were used in lieu of virgin materials to manu-
facture  basic  products,  including  over  81  million  tons  of  iron  and  steel,  five  million
tons of aluminum, 1.8 million tons of copper, and two million tons of stainless steel,
just to name a few. Of the $71 billion, nearly $22 billion worth of material was ex-
ported to 152 countries worldwide, making a significant positive contribution to the
United States balance of trade with other nations.

Recyclers’  capacity  in  the  United  States  to  responsibly  recycle  electronic  equip-
ment  is  comparable  if  not  superior  to  European  operations.  Approximately  2.8  bil-
lion pounds (1.4 million tons) of electronic equipment were recycled in 2006, includ-
ing 65 million units of computer equipment (CPUs, monitors and printers). The elec-
tronics  recycling  process  yielded  approximately  1.3  billion  pounds  of  recyclable  ma-
terials, more than half of which were metals.

Questions submitted by Representative Bob Inglis
Q1. Many manufacturers support a national solution to deal with e-waste; a federal
law  that  would  preempt  the  patchwork  of  State  and  local  laws  that  are  begin-
ning  to  crop  up.  Are  there  any  aspects  of  those  State  laws  that  would/should
be  expanded  to  the  national  level?  What  provisions  of  State  laws  in  place  now
would be detrimental to efforts dealing with e-waste if ramped up to a national
scale?

A1. Short-term Financial Mechanism

ISRI  supports  a  federal  approach  over  a  patchwork  of  State  laws.  As  with  most
of  the  existing  State  laws,  until  such  time  as  the  market  for  recyclable  electronics
becomes  economically  viable,  ISRI’s  policy  supports  holding  producers  responsible
for  the  collection,  transportation  and  recycling  of  household  electronic  equipment
that  has  a  net-negative  cost  to  recycle,  such  as  cathode  ray  tubes  in  monitors  and
televisions.  ISRI  firmly  believes  that  producer  responsibility  will  provide  manufac-
turers with the needed incentive to design their products with an eye to the future,
incorporating design changes that maximize recycling at the end-of-life.

84

We  strongly  encourage  the  Congress  and  the  states  to  end  any  financial  mecha-
nism  as  soon  as  markets  for  recyclable  electronics  become  economically  viable.  We
are not an industry that seeks government subsidies, and we believe markets must
ultimately stand on their own based on solid business principles. However, whatever
financial  mechanism  the  Congress  and  the  states  might  decide  to  adopt  in  order  to
sustain this market, ISRI suggests that a portion should be applied to the research
and  development  of  end-use  markets  for  the  scrap  materials  recovered  from  elec-
tronics products, particularly mixed plastic resins and leaded lass.

Concentrate on Household Monitors & Televisions

Many states are asking OEMs to pay for the costs to recycle electronic equipment
that has a positive value to recycle. This makes no sense. Recyclers do not need help
covering  the  costs  of  recovering  positive  valued  electronics,  like  central  processing
units,  laptops  and  cell  phones.  ISRI  suggests  that  the  federal  bill  only  begin  with
consumer generated monitors and televisions with cathode ray tubes. You may recall
that EPA in recent years finalized a federal rule for CRTs, and their action was very
timely in light of the digital transition. That action may help to alleviate consumers’
reluctance to pay to responsibly recycle these devices.

Electronic Scrap Must Be Allowed To Move

States  lack  the  jurisdiction  to  regulate  exports.  Nevertheless,  ISRI  contends  that
the  stigma  associated  with  ‘‘exporting’’  is  misguided  and  exports  should  be  viewed
from the prism of the realities of the global economy. The focus should be to promote
responsible  recycling  globally  and  concentrate  efforts  towards  enhancing  and  pro-
moting environmentally capable facilities that will receive and properly handle recy-
cled materials anywhere in the world.

Reasonable Performance Requirements

OEMs, in association with interested stakeholders should determine the best proc-
ess performance requirements placed on their businesses; however, there is a grow-
ing  concern  in  Europe  that  performance  requirements  that  are  too  aggressive  can
distort  the  collection  market  and  ultimately  the  long-term  sustainability  of  elec-
tronics  recycling.  Many  in  Europe  (and  a  growing  number  in  the  U.S.  concerned
about domestic programs with high quotas such as Minnesota’s) now argue that per-
formance  quotas  which  are  too  high  can  distort  the  price  of  collection  by  forcing
OEMs to compete for a limited supply of electronic devices. Nevertheless, any quota
system should track the available supply as it relates to the phased-in landfill ban.

Include Transportation Costs

ISRI suggests that transportation costs need to be included with the OEM obliga-
tions because the transportation expense associated with moving old computer mon-
itors and TVs into the recycling stream is one of the largest costs of electronics recy-
cling.  Without  addressing  this  important  consideration,  it  is  likely  many  of  these
older  and  heavier  products  will  not  be  returned  to  the  recycling  stream  by  their
owners.  Therefore,  any  collection  system  must  cover  all  the  costs  of  transportation
in order for the program to be effective.

Landfill Ban for Recyclable Material

As  with  most  states,  keeping  these  materials  out  of  the  landfill  is  an  important
component  to  ensuring  enough  supply  is  available  to  enable  an  economies  of  scale
business  model.  Under  existing  federal  law,  consumers  can  dispose  of  their  house-
hold  electronic  equipment  legally.  In  order  to  ensure  adequate  supply  for  positive-
valued  electronics  equipment,  ISRI  supports  a  national  land-fill  ban  for  recyclable
material that cannot be safely and economically recycled using existing technologies
and methods.

Reasonable Recycling Standards

ISRI  promotes  the  benefits  of  comprehensive,  integrated  environmental,  health
and safety and quality management systems, such as ISRI’s Recycling Industry Op-
erating  Standard  (RIOS),  implemented  by  electronics  recyclers  as  a  means  to  pro-
mote and to ensure the proper handling of electronic products destined for recycling.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. In  your  testimony,  you  suggest  a  National  Sustainable  Electronics  Initiative.
Which federal agency or agencies should oversee this initiative? How should in-
dustry be involved?

A1. We propose that Congress establish a new National Sustainable Electronics Ini-
tiative  which  would  be  composed  of  a  National  Clean  Electronics  Council  (a  gov-
erning  body)  and  a  National  Clean  Electronics  Research  and  Development  Fund
(funded  by  Congress.)  Rather  than  house  this  new  Initiative  in  any  one  federal
agency,  we  propose  that  it  be  a  collaborative  effort  that  would  include  several  fed-
eral  agencies  as  well  as  participation  from  industry,  academia  and  non-govern-
mental  organizations.  We  have  looked  at  the  National  Nanotech  Initiative  and  the
National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory’s  (NREL’s)  Science  and  Technology  Organi-
zation  as  potential  models.  Both  include  broad  representation  of  federal  agencies
with  outside  stakeholders  and  serve  as  good  models  to  address  other  major  federal
needs.  Our  proposal  is  for  an  ‘‘initiative’’  rather  than  a  new  single  agency  ‘‘center’’
and  the  inclusion  of  the  National  Clean  Electronics  Council  is  similar  to  the  gov-
erning structure established for the National Nanotech Initiative.

We believe that it would be most effective if it includes a broad range of expertise
from  federal  agencies  which  could  include  the  Department  of  Commerce,  Depart-
ment  of  Energy,  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services,  National  Institute  for
Occupational  Safety  and  Health,  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  Department  of
Labor,  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration,  National  Science  Founda-
tion, the National Labs, Consumer Products Safety Commission, and other agencies
and  departments  with  appropriate  expertise.  Representatives  from  industry  will
need  to  be  significantly  involved—especially  those  who  are  already  involved  in  re-
search  and  development,  as  well  as  in  environmental  and  occupational  health  and
safety.

Another arena that we believe should be assessed is the model of the Centers for
Excellence  in  the  semiconductor  industry  (through  SEMATECH)  as  well  as  for
nanotechnology,  which  provide  for  collaboration  between  academia  and  industry.
Another  example  is  the  Center  of  Excellence  for  Photovoltaic  Research  and  Edu-
cation.

One of the key issues that will need to be addressed, however, is the need for real
transparency and effective public participation, which often present challenges when
dealing with the electronics and scrap industries. It is also essential that ‘customers’
who  generate  e-waste  (such  as  corporations,  universities,  municipalities,  etc.)  are
valued  stakeholders  in  the  process  of  defining  a  solution  to  this  problem,  as  they
have needs around data security, CRCLA liability, brand name protection, etc.

We  believe  that  a  real  public/private  partnership  between  the  Federal  Govern-
ment  and  industry  experts—with  full  collaboration  from  universities  and  NGOs—
is necessary to address these concerns in a comprehensive manner. We look forward
to  working  with  the  Committee  to  further  define  and  give  shape  to  this  initiative
as it moves forward.
Q2. In  your  testimony  you  stated  that  50  to  80  percent  of  the  electronics  products
taken in for recycling are instead shipped to developing countries where they are
de-manufactured  in  unsafe  and  environmentally  harmful  conditions.  What  ac-
counts for the range in your estimate?

A2. The  50  percent  to  80  percent  figure  is  an  estimate  that  we  have  developed
through  extensive  discussions  with  experts  in  the  industry.  We  initially  developed
this estimate when we were researching and writing the first report on the hazards
of  exporting  electronic  waste—‘‘Exporting  Harm:  The  Toxic  Trashing  of  Asia’’  by
Basel  Action  Network  and  Silicon  Valley  Toxics  Coalition,  February  25,  2002.  See
http://www.computertakeback.com/docUploads/Exporting¥Harm.pdf  for  the  full
report. In doing this research, we discovered that the Federal Government does not
collect  data  on  hazardous  waste  exports  so  it  is  unable  to  measure  or  monitor  this
growing problem. Since there is no effective federal oversight of e-waste exports, the
only way that we are able to make this estimate is by surveying the experts in the
industry.  It  is  a  significant  fact  that  the  U.S.  does  NOT  have  any  definitive  quan-
tities and destinations for exports of electronic waste. All other developed countries,
and  a  total  of  170  nations  are  legally  bound  to  control  and  monitor  their  exports
of  toxic  waste,  as  a  result  of  ratifying  the  Basel  Convention.  The  U.S.  (the  largest

86

generator  of  e-waste  globally)  has  no  system  in  place  to  quantify—much  less  re-
strict—where our toxic waste ends up.

The  reason  most  electronic  waste  collected  for  recycling  is  exported  is  that  waste
generators  here  is  the  U.S.  (such  as  corporations,  universities,  municipalities,  indi-
viduals, etc.) are faced with a choice between paying for their e-waste to be respon-
sibly  managed  in  the  U.S./developed  world  versus  generating  revenue  by  selling
their  e-waste  to  a  broker  or  ‘recycler’  who  exports  it  to  the  highest  bidder  globally,
usually China.

For  example,  many  municipalities  across  the  country  want  to  keep  these  toxins
out of their landfills and would like to offer free recycling to the public so that there
is  no  disincentive  for  the  public  to  bring  equipment  in,  but  this  can  be  very  expen-
sive  for  local  governments.  Because  of  these  pressures,  less  savvy  solid  waste  offi-
cials  frequently  contract  with  exporters  to  either  take  all  the  equipment  for  free  or
even  buy  it  for  a  few  cents  on  the  pound.  These  exporters  usually  do  nothing  other
than repackage the e-waste into international shipping containers, exporting every-
thing  from  sensitive  data  on  hard  drives  to  toxic  waste  (which  is  illegal  for  many
nations to import from the U.S.). On the other hand, responsible U.S. recyclers with
permitted  warehouse  facilities,  providing  data  security,  worker  protections,  U.S.
wages, etc., must charge customers for managing this toxic waste. Even though the
metals market currently has a high market value, responsible recyclers in the U.S.
repeatedly tell us that proper management of the leaded glass, mercury lamps, etc.,
results  in  a  net  cost  for  the  overall  labor  and  administration  of  this  complex  waste
stream.

In  our  unregulated  U.S.  arena,  not  only  are  there  no  hard  numbers  quantifying
exports,  but  there  is  a  very  wide  range  of  recycling  practices  in  an  often  unscrupu-
lous industry. This eaves it up to the waste generators to navigate a complex, multi-
tiered  world  of  brokers  and  middle  men,  all  looking  to  make  a  profit  on  this  prob-
lematic waste stream.

An  additional  factor  that  encourages  export  of  e-waste  is  that  some  U.S.  based
companies that call themselves recyclers are unscrupulous. They engage in outright
bribery in sending shipments of hazardous waste to foreign countries, since it is ille-
gal  for  about  140  countries—the  non-OECD  Basel  Parties—to  trade  in  toxic  waste
with  the  U.S.  In  one  of  the  most  notorious  cases  documented,  Mark  Dallura  of
Chase Electronics explained how the system works:

‘‘Mark  Dallura,  head  of  Chase  Electronics  Inc.  of  Philadelphia,  which  buys  dis-
carded computers in the United States and then ships them to China via Taiwanese
middlemen  based  in  Los  Angeles,  said  he  has  been  in  the  trade  for  15  years  and
has not been slowed by the [Chinese] ban.

‘‘I  sell  it  to  [the  Taiwanese]  in  Los  Angeles  and  how  they  get  it  there  is  not  my
concern,’’  Dallura  said.  ‘‘They  pay  the  customs  officials  off.  Everybody  knows  it.
They show up with Mercedeses, rolls of hundred-dollar bills. This is not small time.
This is big-time stuff. There’s a lot of money going on in this.’’

Dallura said his company gets many of its old computers from recyclers scattered
across  the  United  States.  They  pick  them  up  from  well-intentioned  citizens  and
businesses  that  hand  them  off  at  events  organized  by  cities  and  counties  aimed  at
keeping  e-waste  out  of  landfills.  He  acts  as  a  broker,  consolidating  container  ship-
ments  that  he  then  hands  off  to  the  middlemen.  Most  weeks,  he  ships  at  least  one
container bearing 45,000 pounds of such waste.

http://www.etoxics.org/site/PageServer?pagename=svtc¥washpost¥2¥24¥2003
Since these early stories of exporting toxic e-waste were published, there has been
tremendous  consolidation  and  growth  in  the  U.S.  e-waste  recycling  industry.  Yet,
most  of  these  U.S.  companies  face  frustration  as  they  are  well  under  capacity.  In
contrast,  exporters  offer  cheaper  or  free  service,  subsidized  by  human  health  and
the environment in developing countries.

In recognition of the seriousness of the impact of exporting hazardous e-waste, the
GAO  is  currently  investigating  the  extent  of  the  problem,  at  the  request  of  late
Chairman  Tom.  Lantos.  The  GAO  is  expected  to  report  back  to  Congress  this  fall.
Q3. You  stated  that  electronic  waste  ‘‘would  not  be  an  issue  if  the  products  them-
selves  were  not  so  toxic.’’  Does  Europe’s  Restriction  on  Hazardous  Substances
(RoHS)  Directive  sufficiently  address  the  toxicity  issue  for  electronics?  You  also

A container full of computer monitors brings him a fee of $2,600, he said. During
a recent week, he planned to ship four containers. Two were bound for Hong Kong,
the other two for Nanhai, bearing mainframe computers not covered by China’s ban.

‘‘I could care less where they go,’’ Dallura said. ‘‘My job is to make money.’’

state  that  electronics  products  are  ‘‘poor[ly]  designed’’  in  terms  of  recyclability.
With the increased adoption of extended producer responsibility legislation, have
producers  made  any  changes  to  their  products  to  make  them  easier  to  recycle?
A3. While  the  RoHS  Directive  will  help  address  the  toxicity  issue  to  some  degree,
it  is  really  only  a  drop  in  the  bucket  when  assessing  the  overall  problem.  The  cur-
rent  version  of  RoHS  addresses  only  6  of  the  more  than  1000  substances  that  are
involved  in  the  manufacture  of  electronic  products,  many  of  which  are  toxic—car-
cinogens,  reproductive  toxins,  neurotoxins,  tetratogens,  etc.  With  that  said,  the  Eu-
ropean  Union  is  set  to  revise  RoHS  over  the  next  twelve  months  and  include  addi-
tional substances since there was recognition that RoHS version 1 was a small first
step towards greening the supply chain of the electronic sector. This is another area
where the U.S. needs to become more active.

An  important  recently  published  epidemiological  study  published  by  Richard
Clapp  of  Boston  University  found  high  rates  of  cancer  among  manufacturing  work-
ers  at  IBM  plants  in  the  U.S.  See  Mortality  among  U.S.  employees  of  a  large  com-
puter  manufacturing  company:  1969–2001,  http://www.ehjournal.net/content/5/1/
30. The study, which evaluated the cause of death for over 30,000 IBM workers, con-
cludes:

‘‘Mortality  was  elevated  due  to  specific  cancers  and  among  workers  more  likely
to be exposed to solvents and other chemical exposures in manufacturing operations.
Due to lack of individual exposure information, no conclusions are made about asso-
ciations with any particular agent.’’

Some  product  designers  tell  us  that  manufacturing  of  new  products  happens  in
China  and  other  developing  countries  because  Original  Equipment  Manufacturers
(OEMs)  demand  the  use  of  chemicals  (e.g.,  to  achieve  specific  surface  treatments)
that are no longer allowed in U.S. manufacturing facilities.

It  is  clear  that  the  issue  of  toxicity  is  pervasive  in  electronics  products—from
manufacturing  through  disposal.  This  is  why  we  need  a  major  R&D  initiative  that
helps  major  OEMs—many  of  which  have  headquarters  and  research  and  develop-
ment  operations  based  in  the  United  States—to  replace  chemicals  and  materials
that  are  problematic  throughout  the  life  cycle  of  their  products  with  safer  more  in-
novative  alternatives.  Enhanced  research  and  development  of  environmentally  im-
proved  chemicals  and  materials  can  also  be  an  important  step  toward  improved
global competitiveness.

It  is  also  true  that  electronic  products  are  poorly  designed  in  terms  of
recyclability.  Since  manufacturers  have  not  been  financially  or  physically  respon-
sible  for  end-of-life  treatment  historically,  they  have  not  felt  the  need  to  design  for
recyclability.  For  example,  recyclers  tell  us  that  one  electronic  device  may  have  6–
8  different  types  of  screws  or  fasteners  needed  to  de-manufacture  a  single  piece  of
equipment,  requiring  workers  to  change  tools  multiple  times,  increasing  ergonomic
stresses  and  slowing  efficiency.  This  is  beginning  to  change  with  the  recent  imple-
mentation  of  the  Waste  from  Electronics  and  Electrical  Equipment  (WEEE)  direc-
tive in Europe (2006) and similar new initiatives in many other countries, and this
is  the  principle  reason  that  we  are  supporting  similar  legislation  here  in  the  U.S.
However,  it  is  still  too  early  to  see  much  direct  impact  from  product  re-design  in
response  to  these  new  initiatives,  as  most  of  the  current  waste  stream  doesn’t  in-
clude  these  new  products.  In  fact,  one  of  the  most  significant  technological  innova-
tions—the development of flat panel monitors and TVs to replace Cathode Ray Tube
(CRT)—has  resulted  in  the  creation  of  new  problems  for  recyclers.  While  the  large
amount of lead in CRTs has presented one of the most significant challenges for re-
cycling,  the  transition  to  flat  panel  Liquid  Crystal  Displays  (LCD)  monitors  which
contain  mercury  lamps  has  created  new  challenges,  since  most  of  these  monitors
were  not  designed  for  ease  of  removing  the  mercury  before  shredding  or  recycling.
To  make  matters  worse,  many  manufacturers  are  not  inclined  to  re-design  these
monitors  to  increase  the  ease  of  disassembly.  To  do  so  would  include  costly  design
changes  at  a  time  when  most  manufacturers  are  developing  the  next  generation  of
products based on light emitting diode (LED) technology. This is a good example of
how rapid technological change invariably outpaces the ability of government, work-
ers,  communities,  and  recycling  communities  to  keep  up  and  why  we  need  a  major
new  initiative  to  require  some  baseline  minimums  for  toxic  inputs  and  design  for
recycling, and to better integrate the advances in technological change with society’s
need for improved health and environmental protections.

I  am  providing  links  to  the  following  articles  from  Clean  Production  Action  that

further elaborate on these issues:

2. Why  promote  Green  Chemistry,  http://www.cleanproduction.org/Green.php
Q4. What responsibility should the consumer bear for the end-of-life management of
electronics?  How  can  consumers  be  better  educated  about  recycling  and  who
should  do  this?  Do  you  believe  that  an  eco-label  or  eco-rating  system  for  con-
sumer electronics would motivate consumers to buy products that were more en-
vironmentally friendly?

A4. There is a very significant need for better consumer education about the myriad
challenges of dealing with end-of-life electronics. Most consumers still are not aware
of the hazards resulting from disposal of their old electronic products. Even for those
who  are,  there  are  no  free  and  convenient  options  readily  available  in  most  cases.
Some  consumers  who  are  more  aware  of  the  irresponsible  disposal  of  e-waste  are
hesitant to recycle their e-waste for fear it will not be responsibly recycled. The Fed-
eral Government needs to act to stop low-end practices of dumping e-waste on devel-
oping  countries  and  federal  prisons  so  that  all  those  with  e-waste—consumers  and
institutions—can do so without fear of contributing to the poisoning of other people.
However,  there  needs  to  be  a  combination  of  massive  public  education  and  in-
crease  in  consumer  options  in  order  to  address  the  role  and  responsibility  for  con-
sumers.  One  without  the  other  simply  does  not  work.  Yet,  with  appropriate  atten-
tion to education and convenience, it will be possible to make major changes in the
way  that  consumers  deal  with  their  obsolete  products,  much  in  the  same  way  that
many consumers have significantly changed their behavior with respect to recycling
paper,  aluminum  and  plastic  over  the  past  few  years.  To  create  an  effective  infra-
structure  for  collecting  e-waste  from  consumers  for  recycling  or  reuse,  we  need  to
undertake  a  major  expansion  of  options  for  consumers,  including  return  to  retail
stores,  return  to  nearby  collection  centers,  free  mail  back,  etc.  There  is  a  need  to
encourage people to get their equipment into reuse streams when the equipment has
the most value for another user.

Eco-labels can be a part of this needed cultural change, as has been shown in sev-
eral European countries. The TCO eco-label in Sweden, for instance, has a consumer
awareness  and  acceptance  of  over  80  percent.  Thus,  many  manufacturers  design
their  products  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  European  labels  in  satisfaction  of
consumer  demands.  While  the  U.S.  lags  far  behind  Europe  in  this  regard,  there  is
reason  for  optimism  with  the  experience  of  the  Energy  Star  label,  as  well  as  with
the early interest with the EPEAT labels. Again, the increased availability (and af-
fordability)  of  eco-label  branded  products  combined  with  greater  public  education
will  help  to  motivate  more  consumers  to  purchase  more  environmentally  friendly
products, and more manufacturers to make them.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. How  have  electronics  in  the  waste  stream  changed  over  the  past  decade  and
what predictions can we make about changes in the coming years? How do these
changes  affect  our  ability  to  safely  and  efficiently  recycle  or  reuse  these  devices?
A1. One  of  the  most  important  changes  in  the  electronics  waste  stream  over  the
past  decade  is  the  enormous  growth  rate,  both  in  the  number  of  new  products  and
in the decreasing life span of new products. Electronics innovation is largely driven
by  Moore’s  law  (named  for  Gordon  Moore,  inventor  of  the  semiconductor  and  one
of  the  founders  of  Intel,  who  predicted  in  the  1970s  that  each  new  generation  of
electronic  products  would  be  twice  as  fast  and  twice  as  small  as  the  previous  gen-
eration  (  a  generation  of  electronic  products  is  about  18  months  to  two  years).  This
prediction  has  held  true  for  more  than  three  decades  and  has  been  the  source  of
the enormous innovation driver for the industry. It has also been the underpinning
of  the  rapid  obsolescence  that  underlies  the  rapid  growth  of  e-waste.  This  phe-
nomenon,  when  combined  with  the  development  of  entirely  new  electronic  prod-
ucts—such  as  mobile  phones,  portable  music  players,  flat  panel  displays,  electronic
games,  etc.—has  led  to  the  explosive  growth  in  e-waste  which  is  creating  the  crisis
that  we  are  now  attempting  to  address.  Just  as  the  growth  rate  for  technological
developments  predicted  by  Gordon  Moore  is  exponential,  so  too  is  the  growth  rate
of e-waste.

The  rapid  increase  in  e-waste  makes  it  extremely  challenging  to  develop  com-
prehensive  reuse  and  recycling  systems  that  are  capable  of  keeping  pace.  We  need
to address the huge stockpile of ‘‘historic waste’’ that has accumulated over the past
few decades while at the same time expanding our infrastructure to address the new
growth  in  future  e-waste.  That  is  why  setting  effective  goals  and  timetables  for
manufacturers  to  meet  is  so  important,  since  they  need  to  develop  the  capacity  to
properly collect and recycle not only their fair share of their historic waste but also

to collect and recycle all of their newly created e-waste. When the leading companies
acknowledge  that  they  are  only  collecting  about  15  percent  of  their  waste  products
when compared to new sales, it is a compelling argument that we need enforceable
goals  and  timetables  in  order  to  catch  up  to  the  rapidly  escalating  problems.  We
need  to  get  to  the  point  where  companies  have  successfully  reduced  their  historic
or  legacy  waste  to  zero  as  well  as  implemented  an  effective  program  to  collect  and
process all of their future e-waste.
Q2. Most major manufacturers claim that they do not ship e-waste oversees for recy-
cling. Where does the e-waste found in environmentally unsound recycling oper-
ations originate?

A2. Most  e-waste  that  gets  into  the  ‘‘recycling  stream’’  (as  opposed  to  the  waste
stream)  is  currently  collected  and  recycled  by  municipalities  (in  collection  events
and  permanent  facilities),  recyclers,  asset  recovery  operations,  and  independent
waste  haulers—not  by  the  manufacturers.  The  sources  of  the  e-waste  that  is  being
disposed  of  in  unsound  operations  are  many  and  varied—from  discards  by  public
agencies  to  corporate  disposal  to  household  hazardous  waste.  The  old  TV  that  a
well-meaning consumer hauls down to his city sponsored e-waste collection event on
Earth  Day  very  likely  ends  up  being  exported  to  Asia,  Africa,  or  Latin  America
where  it  is  causing  great  harm.  In  fact,  the  report  by  the  Basel  Action  Network—
‘‘The  Digital  Dump:  The  Export  of  Reuse  and  Abuse  to  Africa’’  which  documents
such  abuses  includes  an  appendix  that  lists  the  origin  of  e-waste  found  in  Nigeria,
based on the asset tags. See http://www.ban.org/BANreports/10-24-05/documents/
ListofAssetTags.xls.  The  report  includes  photos  of  90  asset  tags  which  identify  the
many  diverse  original  owners  of  the  equipment  such  as  the  Department  of  General
Services,  St.  Mary’s  Hospital,  City  of  Houston,  Headquarter  of  U.S.  Army  Corps  of
Engineers, Trinity College, IBM, U.S. Government Property, Wauwatosa School Dis-
trict,  San  Mateo  Union  High  School  District,  Illinois  State  Police,  Kansas  Depart-
ment  of  Transportation,  Michigan  Dept.  of  Natural  Resources,  and  Federated  Sys-
tems Group, INC. The link to the full report is at http://www.ban.org/BANreports/
10-24-05/index.htm  and  the  link  to  the  Asset  Tag  appendix  is  at  http://
www.ban.org/BANreports/10-24-05/documents/ListofAssetTags.xls.  Tax  payer
supported  public  institutions  (such  as  universities,  school  districts,  etc.)
are  under  enormous  pressure  to  select  ‘‘low  bid’’  recycling  contractors  to
dispose  of  their  e-waste,  so  it  no  surprise  that  much  of  the  e-waste  that
ends up being exported to developing countries originates from these insti-
tutions.  This  is  another  reason  why  we  need  to  prohibit  the  export  of  hazardous
e-waste  to  developing  countries  in  order  to  protect  public  institutions  from  having
to do business with low-bid exporters.

While  manufacturers  (and  others)  frequently  claim  that  they  do  not  ship  e-waste

overseas for recycling, there are four important facts to understand:

a. The U.S. has shut down all of its secondary smelters except one (which does
not process circuit boards) and therefore the U.S. companies currently export
their circuit boards to other countries. Some companies, however, ship these
obsolete  circuit  boards  to  state-of-the-art  smelters  in  Canada  and  Europe
where  they  are  processed  in  a  responsible  manner.  Circuit  boards  clearly  do
not need to be exported to developing countries where they continue to cause
great  harm  to  health  and  environment.  The  question  is  not  whether  haz-
ardous e-waste is exported, since much of it is, but rather exported to where.
b. Leaded  glass  has  two  primary  types  of  destinations  (other  than  landfills),
which  are  to  lead  smelters  (like  the  one  remaining  in  the  U.S.,  which  has
limited  capacity  and  charges  for  accepting  the  glass),  and  to  manufacturers
of new CRTs, which are no longer located in the U.S., and are almost exclu-
sively located in developing countries now. So any U.S. company sending old
CRT  glass  into  the  ‘‘glass-to-glass’’  market,  for  ‘recycling’  into  new  CRTs,
must  export  the  leaded  glass  out  of  the  U.S.  Unfortunately,  there  are  not
currently other, better options available for CRT glass.

c. Many  companies  exporting  e-waste  simply  label  the  volumes  as  going  for
‘reuse’ (not recycling), regardless of the end destinations or usage. This is the
central theme of BAN’s second documentary film, ‘‘The Digital Dump.’’

d. Many  unscrupulous  companies  will  frequently  say  that  they  do  not  export
any electronic materials, when they turn it over to brokers or others who do
the exporting. This is a very common ‘white lie’ in the industry.

Q3. Your  testimony  focuses  on  the  potential  harms  of  exposure  to  toxic  chemicals  in
electronics.  However,  doesn’t  exposure  primarily  occur  during  the  recycling  and
waste disposal stages? Since average consumers have little risk of exposure from

their electronic products, shouldn’t we focus our efforts on the end-of-life environ-
mental concerns?

A3. While  there  is  exposure  to  toxic  substances  throughout  the  life  cycle  of  elec-
tronic  products,  the  two  most  toxic  phases  in  the  life  cycle  of  electronics  are  in  the
manufacturing  and  in  recycling  of  the  products.  The  most  significant  exposures  to
toxic  chemicals  occur  in  the  manufacturing  stage  of  the  electronics  life  cycle,  even
more  than  in  the  waste  disposal  stages.  Hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  are  in-
volved  in  electronics  manufacturing,  far  more  than  are  involved  in  recycling,  and
the  variety  of  toxic  chemical  exposures  are  also  more  extensive,  since  many  of  the
chemicals  used  in  manufacturing  do  not  end  up  in  the  products  but  rather  end  up
as  hazardous  waste  or  released  into  the  environment.  I  have  attached  two  articles
that further elaborate on these health hazards: the ‘‘Cancer and Reproductive Risks
in  Semiconductor  Industry’’  by  Dr.  Joseph  LaDou  and  John  Baillar  and  published
in  the  International  Journal  of  Occupational  and  Environmental  Health  (2007)  and
a  paper  that  assesses  the  health  hazards  in  the  circuit  board  industry  entitled
‘‘Printed circuit board industry’’ by Dr. Joseph LaDou from International Journal of
Occupational  and  Environmental  Health  (2006).  A  long  awaited  study  of  chronic
health issues among semiconductor industry workers (funded by the Semiconductor
Industry  Association)  is  due  to  be  published  in  2009  by  researchers  at  Vanderbilt
University.

In addition, recent studies have emerged indicating that people are being exposed
to  toxic  chemicals  during  the  use  of  these  products  in  our  homes  and  workplaces.
Fire retardant chemicals that are used in electronics, including the outer enclosures
of  TVs,  can  migrate  out  of  consumer  products  and  find  their  way  into  our  bodies.
A  study  by  Dr.  Arlene  Blum 
(http://greensciencepolicy.org/files/standards/
MASTERWhitepaper.pdf)  revealed  that  fire  retardants  are  being  ‘‘found  in  rapidly
increasing  levels  in  dust,  the  food  chain,  pets,  wild  animals,  and  human  fat,  body
fluids and breast milk worldwide. The United States has much higher levels of fire
retardant  chemicals  in  dust,  food,  and  breast  milk  than  Europe  where  fire
retardants  are  less  used.  The  average  U.S.  woman’s  body  and  breast  milk  contains
fire  retardant  levels  approaching  those  that  cause  adverse  reproductive  and  neuro-
logical health problems in animals.’’

The  Boston  University  School  of  Public  Health  just  published  an  article  on  April
30,  2008  showing  that  bromine  levels  in  TVs  can  be  related  to  decaBDE  levels  in
dust  in  homes.  Those  homes  with  more  occupants,  and  therefore  presumably  more
TV  usage,  demonstrated  higher  levels  of  decaBDE  in  the  dust.  It  is  believed  that
as  the  temperature  of  the  plastic  TV  enclosure  increases  due  to  usage,  the  rate  at
which  the  decaBDE  migrates  from  the  TV  into  the  dust  is  also  increased  (http://
pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/esthag/2008/42/i11/abs/es702964a.html). 
The
presence  of  fire  retardants  in  household  dust  is  especially  worrisome  because  chil-
dren  take  in  approximately  seven  times  more  pentaBDEs  each  day  than  adults
(Lorber,  M.  2007,  Exposure  of  Americans  to  polybrominated  diphenyl  ethers.  Jour-
nal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology, published online April 11,
2007). Flame retardants are one example of a chemical contained within electronics
that  poses  hazards  throughout  its  entire  life  cycle,  including  the  household  and
workplace use phase.
Q4. Are  worker  and  environmental  safety  protections  in  the  U.S.  adequate  for  e-
waste  recyclers?  Would  you  support  a  system  whereby  U.S.  recyclers  handled
only certain commodities, like CRT monitors?

A4. Worker  and  environmental  safety  regulations  pertaining  to  this  waste  stream
are patently inadequate in the U.S. In fact, many of the toxic materials are exempt
from  RCRA  definitions  of  hazardous  waste,  such  as  the  mercury  lamps  in  LCD
screens,  circuit  boards,  and  all  e-waste  generated  by  households.  While  some  recy-
clers  have  established  state-of-the-art  health  and  safety  protections  for  their  work-
ers, going far beyond compliance, most do not. The lack of meaningful OSHA regula-
tions  and  enforcement,  or  other  worker  health  and  safety  standards  for  recycling
workers  adds  to  the  hazards.  The  recycling  industry  is  still  relatively  new  and  has
not had (to the best of our knowledge) any comprehensive health assessments or in-
dustrial hygiene assessments done. At the same time, there have been isolated stud-
ies done suggesting that recycling workers are being exposed to hazardous materials
in  the  processing  of  e-waste.  One  of  the  leading  such  studies  conducted  in  the  U.S.
is  entitled  ‘‘Occupational  risks  associated  with  electronics  de-manufacturing  and
CRT glass processing operations and the impact of mitigation activities on employee
safety  and  health’’  by  Peters-Michaud,  N.;  Katers,  J.;  Barry,  J.  from  Cascade  Asset
Management,  LLC,  published  in  Electronics  and  the  Environment,  2003.  IEEE

ing  improvements  to  mitigate  exposure  to  potential  harm  from  airborne  contami-

login.jsp?url=/iel5/8575/27162/01208098.pdf?arnumber=1208098.  Another  widely
cited  health  study  of  e-waste  recycling  workers  is  Flame  Retardant  Exposure:
Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers in Blood from Swedish Workers by Andreas Sjodin,
et  al.,  Environmental  Health  Perspectives  Volume  107,  Number  8,  August  1999,
http://www.ehponline.org/docs/1999/107p643-648sjodin/abstract.html.

Similar health concerns have been documented at e-waste recycling facilities man-
aged  by  UNICOR  in  federal  prisons.  See  ‘‘Corporate  Strategies  for  electronics  recy-
cling: A tale of two systems’’ published by Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition and Com-
puter  TakeBack  Campaign,  2003,  http://www.etoxics.org/site/DocServer/pris-
on¥final.pdf?docID=201.  This  is  particularly  important  since  the  U.S.  Government
is the single largest customer for UNICOR, which has been investigated by the U.S.
Department  of  Justice  due  to  complaints  of  toxic  exposure  to  prison  guards,  prison
staff  and  inmates.  In  fact,  when  Leroy  Smith,  a  safety  manager  for  United  States
Penitentiary  Atwater  in  California  tried  to  address  the  health  and  safety  hazards
inside the prison where he worked, his warnings were ignored, he was subjected to
retaliation  by  his  superiors,  and  he  was  subsequently  recognized  by  the  U.S.  Office
of  Special  Counsel  as  a  Public  Servant  for  his  actions  as  a  whistleblower.  For  fur-
ther  information,  see  http://www.peer.org/news/news¥id.php?row¥id=687;  http://

press/2006/pr06¥16.htm

We do not believe that only CRT monitors should be handled within the U.S. since

that serves to push our problems off onto others around the world.
Q5. What  is  an  appropriate  metric  for  recycling?  Should  we  calculate  by  the  weight
of  material  that  is  recycled  or  should  we  measure  by  the  number  of  units  that
are disassembled but not entirely recycled?

A5. This  is  an  important  question  and  one  that  is  at  the  center  of  a  major  debate
now  taking  place  amongst  the  e-waste  recycling  stakeholders.  Many  favor  using
weight as the metric because of its relative ease in measuring and widespread usage
in  industry  practices  already;  others  favor  the  use  of  units  since  it  is  the  best  way
of  measuring  the  number  of  units  recycled  compared  to  the  number  of  units  sold
as  a  way  of  measuring  a  company’s  progress  toward  its  overall  fair  share  goal.
Weight is a less burdensome requirement, and the definition of a ‘unit’ can get com-
plicated  with  components  and  subassemblies  arriving  from  consumers.  Likewise,  it
is  not  useful  to  compare  a  large  TV  console  with  a  small  cell  phone  for  recycling
purposes,  even  though  each  is  ‘‘one  unit.’’  The  other  major  debate  at  this  time  is
whether  ‘‘fair  share’’  metrics  should  be  evaluated  compared  to  ‘‘market  share’’  or  to
‘‘return share.’’ Companies that currently hold a small or no market share (such as
IBM)  favor  a  market  share  approach,  while  companies  that  hold  a  growing  market
share  but  a  relatively  small  return  share  favor  the  alternative  approach  (newer
market  entries).  Since  a  main  purpose  of  effective  metrics  is  to  drive  the  develop-
ment  of  a  comprehensive  recycling  system  which  apportions  financial  responsibility
fairly,  it  is  important  to  develop  metrics  that  can  be  used  to  help  measure  both
weight  and  units.  There  is  a  significant  need  to  improve  the  data  collection  across
the board—from collection, to processing, to export—in order to help develop a more
robust and effective e-waste recycling infrastructure.
Q6. Does  the  Electronics  Take-Back  Coalition  collect  statistics  on  recycling  by  indi-
vidual  manufacturers?  Do  you  know  what  the  average  recycle  rate  of  manufac-
turers is in the U.S. for the following products: CRT monitors, televisions, com-
puters, car batteries, and cell phones?

A6. While  ETBC  has  attempted  to  collect  such  statistics,  it  is  very  difficult  since
only the manufacturers themselves have this data and until recently they have not
made it public. Based on recent environmental reports by Hewlett-Packard and Dell,
we have the following information available:

• There are low overall recycling rates when compared to sales:

— 2007—HP  had  reuse/recycling  rate  of  15  percent  compared  to  sales
seven  years  ago  (including  remarketed  equipment).  That’s  up  from  10
percent in 2006.

— Dell had a reuse/recycling rate of just over 12 percent in 2006.

• Companies  don’t  state  annual  goals  compared  to  sales—just  overall  volumes.
• There is no common way companies track information comparing to sales.

how we are doing in addressing this problem.

• There  is  little  transparency  in  reporting—it  is  difficult  to  really  understand
• There  is  no  reliable  data  available  by  manufacturer  that  describes  the  recy-
cling rate by product such as CRT monitors, TVs, computers, cell phones, etc.
• Dell breaks down recycling volumes by avenue of return (HP does not):

— Asset Recovery Services End-of-lease Returns
— Consumer Recycling Programs and Goodwill End-of-life Parts
— Asset Recovery Business and Dell Factory
— Outlet—Consumer returns and exchanges less than thirty days
— Recycling Events and Tours

This is another area where there is a significant need for better data.

Q7. Is  there  a  full  array  of  non-toxic  substitutes  currently  available  for  use  by  elec-

tronic manufacturers?

A7. There  is  not  a  ‘‘full  array  of  non-toxic  substitutes  currently  available’’  which  is
one of the main reasons why we are promoting the National Sustainable Electronics
Initiative  and  why  we  need  to  significantly  increase  the  research  and  development
funding  for  green  engineering  and  green  chemistry.  Many  currently  essential  com-
pounds  used  in  electronics  production  are  toxic;  they  currently  do  not  have  readily
and  easily  available  and  effective  alternatives  that  have  been  demonstrated  to  be
safer. There are some recent examples of success stories for the substitution of cer-
tain  materials—such  as  the  replacement  of  lead  solder  and  brominated  flame
retardants in response to the RoHS directive in Europe. A small set of market lead-
ers  within  the  industry  are  working  to  establish  chemical/material  standards,  but
this  is  very  difficult  to  do  without  government  regulations  that  level  the  playing
field for the entire sector. Also, there are still significant questions about which sub-
stitutes  are  the  ‘‘most’’  sustainable,  when  evaluating  not  only  toxicity  but  also  per-
sistence, bio-accumulation, greenhouse gas potential, etc. That is why we presented
information  about  the  ‘‘Green  Screen’’  which  can  help  companies  make  informed
choices.  See  http://www.cleanproduction.org/Green.Greenscreen.php  for  more  infor-
mation. It is also true that for many other toxic chemicals used in electronics, there
has  not  been  significant  research  done  to  evaluate  safer  alternatives—at  least  not
that has been made public.

Questions submitted by Representative Daniel Lipinski
Q1. In  2006,  the  Government  Accountability  Office  estimated  that  more  than  100
million  computers,  TVs,  and  monitors  are  thrown  away  each  year.  In  addition,
the EPA estimates that electronic waste is growing two to three times faster than
any other waste stream. Yet presently, there is no specific federal law or regula-
tion  governing  the  disposal  of  consumer  electronic  products  in  the  U.S.  Should
there be?

A1. Yes.  We  do  not  believe  that  solid  waste  (non-hazardous)  landfills  and  inciner-
ators  are  an  acceptable  final  disposition  for  known  toxins,  such  as  lead,  mercury,
cadmium, arsenic, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated diphenylethers, etc. In ad-
dition to questions about long term leaching from plastic lined landfills, solid waste
officials  are  increasingly  worried  about  future  liability  for  allowing  these  immortal
heavy  metals  and  chemicals  into  non-hazardous  landfills  and  incinerators.  Already,
studies  show  that  70  percent  of  heavy  metals  in  landfills  come  from  electronic
waste.

Several states have already banned at least some electronic components from dis-
posal  in  solid  waste  facilities,  frustrated  that  the  Federal  Government  has  not  ad-
dressed  this  complex  and  partially  toxic  waste  stream.  In  addition,  countless  cities
and counties across the country have also banned such disposal, even ahead of their
State  legislatures.  The  amount  of  scientific  literature  on  the  toxic  impacts  of  lead
alone  ought  to  be  enough  to  convince  anyone  that  putting  them  in  landfills  make
no sense whatsoever.

We believe that there is a real need to establish ground rules for addressing haz-
ardous  e-waste,  similar  to  what  the  Europeans  did  with  the  WEEE  directive.  But
we also believe that the states have an important role to play in serving as the incu-
bators  of  effective  policy.  Thus,  any  federal  initiative  must  build  on  the  experience
of the states rather than undermine them. In particular, we believe that the Federal
Government should first ban the export of toxic e-waste to developing countries Per-
haps, in the future there should be a strong federal solution that is modeled on the
best State laws, but a weak federal effort that undermines the states and preempts

93

them  with  weaker  language  that  sets  a  low  bar  as  a  ceiling  would  be  a  major  set-
back. A federal law that sets minimum standards and allows and encourages states
to  go  beyond  those  standards  would  be  a  good  model  and  one  which  works  well  in
many other arenas. It is also important to remember that traditionally waste policy
and practice has been the province of local (and State) governments that are closest
to  the  problems,  and  that  it  is  imperative  that  national  legislation  support  this
model and not undermine it.
Q2. The  EPA  estimates  that  at  most,  only  15  percent  of  products  at  the  end  of  their
useful  lives  reach  a  recycling  or  reuse  program.  This  does  not  come  as  a  shock
to me. In fact, it might seem a little high given the impediments that consumers
currently face.

Q2a. First, how are average consumers to know what to do with their e-waste when

it comes to the end of its useful life?

A2a. We  need  a  comprehensive,  well  financed  public  education  campaign  to  better
inform  consumers  about  what  to  do  with  their  obsolete  electronics—starting  with
the importance of reuse as a first priority. At the same time we need a comprehen-
sive,  convenient  and  accessible  and  affordable  e-waste  recycling  and  reuse  infra-
structure  so  that  consumers  who  are  informed  will  be  able  to  access  it.  We  need  to
make  recycling  of  electronic  products  just  as  easy  as  it  is  to  buy  new  products.  We
have been engaged with many companies at the highest level urging them to engage
their  customers  to  inform  them  about  the  importance  of  recycling—at  the  point  of
purchase, on the new products or packaging themselves, through utility billing, solid
waste official websites, as well as at convenient end-of-life recycling sites. The sales
and  marketing  ingenuity  of  companies  like  HP,  Dell,  Sony,  Apple,  etc.  to  educate
consumers  about  how  and  why  to  purchase  new  products  has  been  demonstrated
conclusively.  They  can  also  use  those  skills  to  educate  their  consumers  on  how  to
properly  recycle  their  equipment.  The  tobacco  industry  and  the  alcohol  industry
have  invested  significant  amounts  of  funds  in  robust  advertising  campaigns  to  pro-
mote responsible consumer behavior; there is no reason why the electronics industry
can’t do the same. These efforts, of course, should be done in close collaboration with
other  stakeholders  to  help  make  sure  that  the  both  the  messages  and  the  delivery
of the messages, are effective.
Q2b. This  past  weekend,  Washington,  D.C.  held  an  e-waste  recycling  day.  Over  ten
times  as  many  residents  as  last  year  showed  to  recycle  their  gadgets,  leading
to over two hours wait time. The incentives to recycle just don’t seem to be there
right now. What do you recommend be done to fix this problem?

A2b. This  exact  same  phenomena  has  occurred  in  many  places  around  the  country
for  the  past  several  years,  due  to  the  pent  up  demand  by  consumers  to  find  acces-
sible  recycling  options.  In  fact,  in  some  cases  the  lines  of  cars  waiting  to  recycle  e-
waste  were  so  long  that  they  created  major  traffic  jams  and  had  to  be  shut  down.
The  solution  is  not  to  keep  holding  individual  events,  although  they  can  be  useful
to  initiate  public  discussion.  What  is  really  needed,  however,  is  a  permanent,  ongo-
ing,  convenient  system  that  makes  it  easy  for  consumers  to  recycle  their  old  prod-
ucts  so  that  it  becomes  a  normal  habit,  much  the  same  way  that  people  now  are
in  the  habit  of  recycling  cans,  bottles  and  newspapers.  Yet,  because  recycling  elec-
tronic  products  is  more  complicated  and  potentially  hazardous  than  these  other
products, a curb-side collection model is not favored. Likewise, there is a much more
important reuse market and potential for electronic products, and putting them into
curbside  collection  containers  could  undermine  their  reuse  potential.  Developing
policies  that  promote  a  major  expansion  of  e-waste  recycling  collection  sites  and
methods  is  the  real  key  to  developing  an  effective  infrastructure—a  wide  variety  of
sites and methods that include retail stores, charities like Goodwill, shopping malls,
schools, offices, community centers and senior centers, apartment complexes, trans-
fer stations, mail back programs, etc. Sony has developed a good model, for a start,
by announcing that their goal is to establish a recycling drop off site within 20 miles
of  most  of  the  U.S.  population;  ultimately  we  will  need  a  model  that  provides  for
even closer proximity. While we are a long way from meeting that goal, it is impor-
tant that we get there as quickly as possible and then improve it so that it is even
more  convenient.  It  ought  to  be  recalled  that  when  consumers  had  to  travel  five  to
10  miles  to  drop  off  their  household  recycling,  the  participation  rate  was  very  low,
but  when  collection  became  convenient,  the  rates  of  participation  went  way  up.  It
ought  also  to  be  noticed  that  many  electronic  products  are  much  heavier  and  more
difficult to transport than are other household goods that are recycled.

One additional development of note is that some of the producers—such as Sony,
Dell,  Hewlett  Packard,  Apple,  etc.—as  well  as  some  retailers—such  as  Best  Buy—

94

have  been  experimenting  with  incentives  to  encourage  consumers  to  bring  back
their old electronics when purchasing new products and their experiences have been
generally  favorable.  Consumers  have  responded  well  to  coupons  that  provide  dis-
counts on purchases of new products when they return older ones.
Q3. The  European  Union  is  often  ahead  of  the  United  States  when  it  comes  to  the
issue  of  recycling.  Where  do  U.S.  capabilities  stand  as  compared  to  Europe  on
the topic of e-waste?

A3. The U.S. is behind Europe in e-waste recycling in several significant ways:

• European laws have been on the books for several years—at the national level
going  back  more  than  10  years,  and  at  the  EU  level  since  2005.  Electronics
manufacturers, governments, recyclers, and consumers have all been involved
in  developing  effective  recycling  systems  and  infrastructure  for  many  years
and therefore have a big head start over the United States. Many other coun-
tries  in  Asia  and  elsewhere  are  also  ahead  of  the  U.S.  in  this  area,  having
passed  their  own  versions  of  producer  take-back  laws.  With  the  passage  by
some  states  of  e-waste  legislation,  there  is  a  growing  awareness  and  accept-
ance  as  well  as  a  developing  infrastructure  in  some  parts  of  the  U.S.,  but  it
is still in its infancy.
• In  Europe,  leading  brand  name  electronics  companies  established  the  Euro-
pean Recycling Platform several years ago to get ahead of the recycling initia-
tives  that  they  saw  coming,  but  many  of  these  same  companies  have  been
slower  to  take  such  a  proactive  stance  in  the  U.S.  in  the  absence  of  national
legislative leadership.
• The  U.S.  is  finally  beginning  to  develop  a  growing  recycling  infrastructure,
with  capital  venture  coming  into  the  industry  and  therefore  consolidation  oc-
curring. Some well funded, large recyclers in the U.S. are currently operating
under capacity, and would love nothing more than to shut down the mass ex-
port  of  this  waste  stream  from  the  U.S.  (The  one  exception  is  that  shredded
e-waste  goes  to  smelters  for  further  reclamation  of  materials,  and  the  U.S.
has shut down all secondary smelters but one.)
• It  is  also  important  to  note  that  the  EU  has  not  only  passed  laws  requiring
manufacturers to collect and pay for recycling of their electronic products, but
the EU has also ratified and enforced a UN treaty (the Basel Convention and
the Amendment to the Convention) making it illegal for EU countries to ship
toxic waste to any developing country for recycling or disposal. Keeping their
e-waste  within  the  EU  not  only  builds  their  businesses,  but  provides  an  in-
centive  for  the  EU  to  find  safer  alternatives  to  toxins  they  must  manage
themselves, unlike the U.S.
• The  political  climate  in  Europe  is  also  quite  different  from  that  in  the  U.S.
Whereas  the  U.S.  was  the  global  environmental  leader  several  decades  ago,
that  mantle  of  leadership  has  been  assumed  by  the  EU  which  has  now  be-
come  the  global  environmental  leader,  as  evidenced  by  the  passage  of  the
WEEE  directive,  RoHS  directive,  the  REACH  directive,  etc.  Consumers  as
well  as  companies  have  come  to  accept  that  leadership  in  Europe  while  we
are still trying to develop that culture within the U.S.

Q4. As  the  country  transitions  to  digital  television  next  year,  I  am  concerned  that
this will divert potentially millions of old analog TVs into the waste stream. Are
we  prepared  for  this  wave  of  old  technology?  Should  a  system  be  put  in  place
to educate consumers on how to dispose of their TVs, especially our seniors who
will  be  most  impacted  by  this  change  and  probably  least  likely  to  know  how  to
recycle?

A4. We agree that this is one of the most pressing issues that we face as the digital
transition will greatly exacerbate what is already a major environmental crisis. The
U.S. does not have in place anything remotely needed to meet this impending dead-
line—either  in  terms  of  the  capacity  to  properly  collect  and  responsibly  recycle  the
millions  of  old  TVs  that  will  be  discarded  or  in  terms  of  the  public  education  nec-
essary  to  inform  people  about  what  to  do.  Again,  it  is  a  two  fold  issue—the  need
for  appropriate  and  convenient  infrastructure  combined  with  massive  public  edu-
cation  to  help  people  better  understand  what  their  options  are.  Education  with  out
accessible infrastructure is just as frustrating and ineffective as infrastructure with-
out public education.

We believe that there needs to be a substantial effort to reach out to seniors who
are disproportionally linked to the older, analog TVs and who seem to be less likely
to  be  connected  to  cable  or  satellite  TV.  They  are  also  less  likely  to  be  comfortable

with  purchasing  and  installing  a  new  digital  converter  box  and  more  likely  to  be
intimidated  by  the  prospect  of  having  to  do  so.  This  seems  to  be  an  area  that  is
ripe  for  a  major  new  initiative  by  the  industry  in  conjunction  with  the  FCC.  We
urge  Congress  to  prod  the  Consumer  Electronics  Association  to  work  with  the  FCC
to  help  avert  a  major  injustice  to  seniors  to  make  sure  that  they  do  not  end  up  as
collateral damage of the digital conversion.

In addition, we are also very concerned that with the anticipated increase of older
televisions  being  discarded  due  to  the  digital  television  conversion,  there  will  be  a
significant increase in the amount of lead coming into the waste stream, which will
have  several  significant  impacts.  First  and  foremost,  the  increased  environmental
loading  of  lead  to  the  environment  for  older  CRT  televisions  that  end  up  in  waste
sites will result in millions of pounds of lead being added to the environment. Since
older  CRT  televisions  contain  several  pounds  of  lead—estimates  range  from  four  to
eight pounds an up, depending on the size of the unit—and since current projections
estimate  that  tens  of  millions  of  televisions  will  be  discarded,  the  environmental
loading will be enormous. All of this will be happening without proper governmental
oversight,  since  in  most  states  it  is  still  legal  to  simply  discard  old  electronic  prod-
ucts into landfills.

In addition, for those CRT televisions that do get recycled, the amount of lead re-
covered will also be so substantial that it will likely cause a significant decrease in
the  price  of  lead  when  it  is  recycled.  This  will  likely  increase  the  amount  of  lead
that  is  used  in  making  new,  cheap  consumer  products.  Thus,  another  unintended
consequence of the digital conversion will likely be the increase in dangerous mate-
rials  in  cheap  consumer  goods  that  will  be  imported  into  the  U.S.  and  potentially
harm the children who will be exposed to them. This problem will continue to grow
until the Federal Government gets firm control over the lead and other toxic mate-
rials contained in obsolete electronic products.

For  all  of  these  reasons,  we  urge  Congress  to  adopt  a  comprehensive  ban  on  the
export of hazardous e-waste, including lead, and applaud the House for passing H.R.
1534,  the  Mercury  Export  Ban  Act  (Rep.  Allen  (D)  ME  and  14  co-sponsors)  which
is an important step in the right direction.
Q5. In  your  testimony,  you  address  the  EPEAT  program,  which  I  think  sounds  like
a  great  idea  in  the  wake  of  the  Energy  Star  Program’s  success.  Can  you  tell  us
a  little  bit  more  about  this  program?  Why  has  the  EPEAT  board  postponed
plans to develop standards for televisions? Energy Star has been immensely suc-
cessful  and  I  would  predict  EPEAT  could  be  equally  successful  by  providing  a
viable rating tool for consumers.

A5. We  agree  that  EPEAT  has  the  potential  to  match  the  success  of  the  Energy
Star  program.  For  computers  alone,  EPEAT  has  already  influenced  over  a  billion
dollars  worth  of  purchasing  decisions.  Expanding  EPEAT  to  include  other  product
categories  has  been  met  with  staunch  resistance  from  television  manufacturers,
however.  We  believe  that  this  is  because  EPEAT  has  a  provision  that  encourages
company-side  product  take-back  programs,  and  with  the  important  exception  of
Sony,  the  rest  of  the  TV  industry  has  not  developed  comprehensive  national  take
back programs, unlike many of the computer companies. ETBC has urged EPA and
others to move forward with EPEAT for TVs and attended the recent scoping meet-
ing  in  Washington,  DC  to  urge  them  to  do  so.  We  made  the  point  that  this  is  of
paramount importance given the impending digital deadline for conversion, but the
decision  to  develop  standards  for  TVs  was  postponed  due  to  lack  of  support  from
the  TV  companies  as  well  as  due  to  the  lack  of  full  financial  support  from  EPA,
which  would  have  only  required  $115,000.  There  have  also  been  efforts  to  restrict
the  scope  of  EPEAT  to  apply  only  to  institutional  purchasers.  By  not  targeting  the
consumer  market,  we  are  fail  to  address  a  large  part  of  the  e-waste  problem.  This
important purchasing tool should be expanded to cover consumer products, particu-
larly in the case of TVs.

We  would  like  to  see  the  EPA  fully  fund  to  the  development  of  this  standard.
Right  now  they  partially  fund  it  and  have  to  raise  remaining  resources  from  what-
ever product sector is affected by the developing standard.

Questions submitted by Representative Phil Gingrey
Q1. In  September  of  2007  the  House  passed  H.R.  2850,  the  Green  Chemistry  Re-
search  and  Development  Act  of  2007,  which  undertakes  many  of  the  rec-
ommendations  in  your  testimony.  Does  the  Electronics  Take-Back  Coalition
agree with the goals and policies in H.R. 2850 and have you supported passage
of the companion bill, S. 2669, in the Senate?

A1. The  Electronics  Take  Back  Coalition  supports  green  chemistry  application  in
the  electronic  sector  and  believes  it  is  one  of  the  most  promising  ways  to  green  the
supply  chain  of  the  electronics  industry.  One  of  ETBC’s  coalition  partners,  Clean
Production Action has actively worked to build support for the legislation. With that
said,  this  legislation  has  an  indirect  influence  on  the  electronic  sector.  Authorizing
$84 million is a small investment compared to other major government research and
development  programs  such  as  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  worth  more
than  a  billion  dollars.  ETBC  will  continue  to  leverage  support  for  Green  Chemistry
application in the electronic sector, but the scale of investment for new research and
development will need to meet the scale of production of electronic products.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Michael  T.  Williams,  Executive  Vice  President  and  General  Counsel,

Sony Electronics Inc.

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. You state in your testimony that Sony has long been an industry leader in envi-
ronmentally  friendly  design.  What  are  some  of  the  design  changes  Sony  has
made that have resulted in greener products? Have any of these increased either
the  recyclability  of  the  product  or  the  use  of  recycled  materials  in  the  product?
A1. (a). ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN: Sony has pioneered the elimination of haz-
ardous  materials  in  its  products  and  the  creation  of  more  energy  efficient  devices.
We have, among other things: (1) eliminated the use of lead in solder; (2) eliminated
the  use  of  brominated  flame  retardants;  (3)  developed  numerous  products  that  use
less  energy  and/or  can  be  powered  by  rechargeable  batteries;  (4)  created  new  lith-
ium-ion, rechargeable battery technology that eliminated the need for nickel or cad-
mium  in  most  batteries;  (5)  led  the  change  in  display  technology  from  cathode  ray
picture tube (CRT) televisions that used lead to liquid crystal display (LCD) displays
that  use  no  lead;  (6)  developed  the  organic  light-emitting  diode  (OLED)  television
which can result in reduced power consumption of up to 40 percent per panel square
inch as compared to other television technologies. In addition, Sony has reduced the
types  of  plastic  we  use  and  reduced  the  amount  of  packaging  materials,  thus,  sub-
stantially  eliminated  the  need  or  use  of  ozone  depleting  chemicals.  And  finally,  by
reducing  the  number  of  screws  that  hold  the  products  together  and  the  other  non-
recyclable  or  incompatible  materials  in  our  products,  Sony  has  developed  products
specifically designed to make it easier to recycle.

(b).  USE  OF  POST-CONSUMER  MATERIALS:  In  the  long-term,  the  elimi-
nation  of  hazardous  materials  in  covered  products  will  make  recycling  easier  and
more cost-effective, consequently, making more post-consumer material available for
new  products.  In  the  short-term,  it  is  difficult  to  reuse  old  post-consumer  recycled
material  in  new  products,  because  of  concerns  about  incidental  contamination  of
toxic metals and flame retardants in the recycled material.
Q2. How  does  Sony  advertise  its  take-back  program?  You  state  in  your  testimony
that  Sony’s  goal  is  to  increase  the  amount  of  products  collected  through  your
take-back  program  to  600  million  pounds  per  year  within  five  years.  Since  the
program started in September of 2007, you report that Sony has collected seven
million  pounds.  How  does  Sony  plan  to  increase  the  amount  collected  so  sub-
stantially? How much does Sony’s recycling program currently cost?

A2. (a). CONSUMER EDUCATION: Sony is using a wide range of methods to pro-
mote its Take Back program, including the use of print, television, and radio media.
We  also  use  our  50  regional  ‘‘recycling  events’’  to  educate  consumers  and  retailers
about  our  program  as  well  as  our  many  fixed  recycling  locations.  Sony  is  also  com-
mitted  to  cross-marketing  and  promotion  with  our  national  Take  Back  partner,
Waste  Management,  Inc.  (‘‘WMI’’),  and  various  government  and  nongovernmental
organizations.

(b). SONY’S PROGRAM GOALS: Presently, Sony has, in conjunction with WMI,
almost  150  locations  in  which  a  consumer  can  drop  off  a  product.  To  achieve  our
goal  of  recycling  600  million  pounds  per  year,  we  will  need  to  establish  roughly
10,000 drop off locations that would feed into the WMI recycling network. Candidly,
we  cannot  reach  this  benchmark  without  the  active  participation  of  other  e-waste
stakeholders. We are, therefore, actively seeking the participation of retailers, other
manufacturers,  and  non-profits.  Indeed,  as  a  direct  result  of  the  Committee’s  e-
waste  hearing,  Sony  has  entered  into  discussions  with  Goodwill  Industries.  And  by
way of example, we have worked to help create a similar successful program for re-
chargeable  battery  collections.  Through  the  non-profit  ‘‘Rechargeable  Battery  Recy-
cling  Corporation’’  (of  which  Sony  is  a  part  owner  and  present  Chairman  of  the
Board)  we  have  established  50,000  locations  in  the  United  States  that  will  accept
batteries for recycling.

(c). PROGRAM COSTS: Sony treats the cost of its Take Back program as a con-

fidential trade secret.
Q3. You  state  in  your  testimony  that  some  recycled  plastics  will  be  purchased  and
used to make new electronics products. Approximately how much post-consumer

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:58 Aug 25, 2008 Jkt 041901 PO 00000 Frm 00101 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\043008\41901 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

98

recycled plastic does Sony use in its products now? How much of that is plastic
recovered from electronic waste?

A3. USE  OF  POST-CONSUMER  MATERIALS:  Sony  products  manufactured  in
the  United  States  use  approximately  five  percent  post-consumer  recycled  plastics.
At  this  point,  little  of  those  plastics  come  from  recovered  electronic  waste  because
of  some  of  the  concerns  identified  above  in  1(b).  We  do  expect,  however,  that  both
the  amount  of  post-consumer  material  Sony  uses  and  the  amount  of  such  material
related to waste electronics will increase dramatically as our program achieves even
greater success.
Q4. In your testimony you mention ‘‘ ‘no name’ brands (that) are made of lower qual-
ity  materials,  which  can  contain  higher  levels  of  toxic  chemicals  and  may  be
more  difficult  to  recycle.’’  You  also  mention  the  need  for  consumer  education
about  recycling.  Would  an  eco-ranking  system  for  consumer  electronic  products
help educate consumers about the environmental impacts of these products?

A4. ECO-RANKING  SYSTEM:  An  ‘‘eco-ranking  system’’  for  consumer  electronic
products  would  be  a  good  idea.  To  be  helpful  to  consumers,  however,  it  would  have
to  employ  clearly  understandable  criteria  and  be  consistently  administered  by  the
Federal Government. Presently, there are many ranking systems from various orga-
nizations and countries which employ different criteria. The end result of this patch-
work of ranking systems is largely only consumer confusion.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. What is the total life cycle energy cost of Sony’s e-Reader? What is the equivalent
to this energy usage in pages printed from a typical printer? Does Sony currently
publish  the  life  cycle  energy  costs  for  all  your  products?  If  not,  would  you  con-
sider providing such information to consumers in the future?

A1. LIFE  CYCLE  COSTS:  Sony  does  not  currently  publish  the  life  cycle  energy
costs for its products but would be willing to do so provided that the proper metrics
for such a measurement can be developed and standardized.
Q2. What  are  the  liability  concerns  for  companies  that  take-back  electronics  and
reuse or recycle them? Does liability for damages to workers from exposure dur-
ing  recycling  or  liability  for  harm  caused  by  refurbished  equipment  limit  the
growth of take-back programs?

A2. LIABILITY ISSUES: Sony  cannot  comment  on  liability  issues  related  to  recy-
cling  of  waste  electronics  since  we  do  not  handle  the  actual  recycling,  but  rather,
use the country’s leading recycler, WMI, to manage that part of our Take Back pro-
gram. Please note, however, that Sony firmly believes and supports stringent work-
er and environmental protection requirements for the recycling industry. Indeed, to
the  best  of  our  knowledge,  Sony  is  the  only  electronics  manufacturer  to  sign  the
Electronics Take Back Coalition’s ‘‘Pledge of True Stewardship’’ (the ‘‘Pledge’’) which
prescribes  strict,  environmentally-  and  socially-conscious  limitations  on  how  and
where electronics waste can be recycled.
Q3. Most major manufacturers claim that they do not ship e-waste overseas for recy-
cling. Where does the e-waste found in environmentally unsound recycling oper-
ations originate?

A3. OVERSEAS  RECYCLING:  Sony  has  no  direct  knowledge  about  the  products
that  are  recycled  overseas.  But  as  noted  above,  as  a  signatory  to  the  Pledge,  we
have  committed  that  all  products  that  are  collected  through  the  Sony  Take  Back
program  will  be  recycled  using  the  strictest  and  highest  environmental  standards.
Moreover,  we  provide  full,  public  accountability  of  how  and  where  our  products  are
recycled.
Q4. How  does  Sony  treat  products  from  other  manufacturers  at  your  recycling  cen-

ters in terms of cost to the consumer and disposal?

A4. SONY PRODUCTS VS. OTHER PRODUCTS: Sony pays for the recycling of
all Sony-branded products, but the consumer must pay the cost to recycle any other
brands.
Q5. Can you give us some examples of how Sony has had to tailor its recycling pro-
grams  to  meet  different  State  requirements?  Considering  that  e-waste  recycling
already occurs under a variety of legal frameworks in the U.S., why should fed-
eral  legislation  preempt  States  from  experimenting  with  different  collection  sys-
tems or fees?

99

A5. (a).  STATE  PREEMPTION:  State  preemption  is  necessary  to  create  a  single,
consistent  e-waste  recycling  program  that  will  develop  the  economies  of  scale  re-
quired  to  make  recycling  cost-effective  and  to  create  enough  recycled  material  to
make re-using large quantities of such material in new products realistic. The recy-
cling of e-waste is not a traditional local or State issue that can or should be treated
differently  based  on  the  particularities  of  each  jurisdiction.  Rather,  e-waste  is  ex-
actly  the  opposite.  That  is,  the  same  products  that  are  sold  in  Tennessee  are  sold
in Texas and the means to recycle those products are the same across jurisdictions.
Society  will  not  benefit  from  the  traditional  notion  of  allowing  the  states  to  serve
as  incubators  of  new  and  novel  approaches.  And  even  if  this  were  the  case,  there
have certainly already been enough states that have enacted different e-waste laws
that  Congress  can  benefit  from  any  and  all  available  ‘‘lessons’’  learned  from  these
various State ‘‘experiments.’’

(b). THE CONTRADICTORY STATE LAWS: The disparity between the starkly
differing  State  e-waste  laws  inherently  creates  inefficiencies  and  complications  in
how Sony runs its Take Back program. For example, we cannot operate our program
in the State of Maine; that state chooses the recyclers to be used and charges manu-
facturers a tax based upon the amount of products collected. In contrast, Minnesota
and  Washington  have  identified  the  number  of  manufacturers  that  must  have  pro-
grams  and/or  pay  fees,  even  though  manufacturers  sell  consumer  electronics  in
every  state.  Indeed,  to  operate  a  recycling  program  in  the  State  of  Washington,  we
must have fixed collection locations in each of the 80 counties.
Q6. How  would  you  describe  the  influence  of  other  countries’  recycling  and  waste
laws—such as Japan—on your Take Back and Recycle programs? Do these laws
affect your global operations?

A6. (a).  OTHER  COUNTRIES:  The  recycling  laws  of  other  countries  have  a  lim-
ited  impact  on  what  Sony  is  doing  in  the  United  States.  Our  Take  Back  program
is the result of over 15 years of experimenting and testing by Sony’s U.S. operations.
(b).  SONY’S  GLOBAL  RECYCLING  GOAL:  Sony  is  a  global  company,  and  as
such,  all  laws  affect  our  global  operations.  Sony  has  as  a  goal  to  globally  conform
to the most stringent environmental regulations world-wide. In the case of our U.S.
Take  Back  recycling  program,  Sony  believes  that  we  are  well  ahead  of  that  goal.
Q7. You argue that e-waste legislation should cover all products with certain compo-
nents or chemicals. How do the recycling processes differ between a Sony laptop
and a Sony LCD or plasma television?

A7. RECYCLING  OF  VARIOUS  PRODUCTS:  The  actual  recycling  of  various
electronic  products  does  not  differ  much.  When  recycling  our  products  we  look  at
three components: glass, metal, and plastics. It matters little what type of products
these components come from. Indeed, it is not the actual recycling of different types
of  products  that  creates  issues,  but  rather  the  logistics  and  costs  associated  in  the
collection and management of products as these can vary substantially as to weight
and size.
Q8. How  much  does  it  cost  Sony  to  collect  and  recycle  all  their  legacy  waste?  What
are  the  benefits—other  than  the  obvious  environmental  ones—to  your  company?
How  has  the  program  impacted  your  ability  to  compete  within  the  global  mar-
ketplace?

A8. COSTS  AND  GLOBAL  COMPETITION:  Sony  treats  the  cost  of  its  Take
Back  program  as  a  confidential  trade  secret.  The  goal  of  the  program,  however,  is
to  make  electronics  recycling  a  cost-effective,  profitable  business.  If  Sony  succeeds
in our efforts, we will have created a low-cost, efficient source of post-consumer plas-
tic  and  metals  for  our  new  products,  thus  making  Sony  more  competitive  in  the
global marketplace.

Questions submitted by Representative Daniel Lipinski
Q1. In  2006,  the  Government  Accountability  Office  estimated  that  more  than  900
million  computers,  TVs,  and  monitors  are  thrown  away  each  year.  In  addition,
the EPA estimates that electronic waste is growing two to three times faster than
any other waste stream. Yet presently, there is no specific federal law or regula-
tion  governing  the  disposal  of  consumer  electronic  products  in  the  U.S.  Should
there be?

A1. A FEDERAL LAW. Sony urges you to adopt legislation that supports our exist-
ing efforts and extends the environmental stewardship we have demonstrated to all

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:58 Aug 25, 2008 Jkt 041901 PO 00000 Frm 00103 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\043008\41901 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

electronics  manufacturers  and  retailers.  While  we  are  confident  that  Sony’s  vol-
untary e-waste recycling program will make great strides forward, only a truly com-
prehensive  and  consistent  program  will  allow  all  interested  parties  to  achieve  our
shared recycling goals. Sony, therefore, respectfully requests that any legislation re-
flect the following:
• Preemption

Although  it  is  of  course  a  significant  event  when  Congress  preempts  State
regulation on a particular point, Sony believes that electronics recycling is an
issue  on  which  State  preemption  is  essential.  We  and  other  stakeholders  al-
ready have to comply with numerous, and sometimes contradictory, State and
local e-waste laws. The inconsistency between these programs inevitably cre-
ates  inefficiencies  in  the  system  and  minimizes  any  economies  of  scale  that
could  be  achieved.  And  since  Sony  (and  likely  no  other  manufacturer)  does
not build products to be sold in a particular state, adding a federal bill with-
out  State  preemption  merely  adds  more  complexity  rather  than  simplifying
and  streamlining  the  process.  In  the  end,  a  patchwork  quilt  of  different  and
ultimately  contradictory  State  and  municipal  laws  will  only  serve  to  under-
mine  everyone’s  shared  goal  of  recycling  as  much  electronic  waste  as  effi-
ciently and cheaply as possible.

• Producer Responsibility

Sony believes that it is the individual manufacturer’s responsibility to assure
that  any  product  that  bears  its  name  is  properly  recycled  using  the  highest
standards  possible  at  the  end  of  the  product’s  life.  That  said,  other  stake-
holders who directly benefit from the sale or enjoyment of electronic products
must  also  bear  some  responsibility.  More  specifically,  retailers—at  the  very
least—must  take  an  active  role  in  the  collection  of  e-waste  and  consumers
must  be  encouraged  to  take  the  extra  step  necessary  to  properly  dispose  of
their products.
• Market Share

In  order  to  create  a  level  playing  field,  any  manufacturer  obligation  should
be based upon present market share and not on historical activities or waste
collected.  Systems  based  upon  the  amount  of  waste  collected  will  give  a  cost
advantage  to  those  companies  that  are  new  to  the  market.  Such  companies
can avoid any recycling cost by simply staying in business and changing their
brand  or  company  name  every  year.  Many  of  these  ‘‘no  name’’  brands  are
made  of  lower  quality  materials,  which  can  contain  higher  levels  of  toxic
chemicals and may be more difficult to recycle. Any mandate not based upon
today’s market share will give those companies a ‘‘free ride’’ on recycling. This
will  lower  their  costs  when  compared  to  responsible  companies  by  rewarding
manufacturers  who  avoid  their  environmental  obligations  and  penalizing  re-
sponsible companies by putting environmentally-advanced products at a com-
petitive cost disadvantage.

• Products Covered

Our  recycling  program  covers  all  of  our  branded  products  from  movies  (i.e.,
DVDs),  to  professional  equipment  used  to  project  movies  in  theaters,  to
laptops or televisions used to watch movies at home.
Sony,  therefore,  respectfully  urges  you  to  adopt  one  program  with  one  set  of
requirements  which  will  require  full  producer  responsibility  for  all  products
manufactured. The advancement of technology has enabled manufacturers to
create  an  array  of  products  using  the  same  chemicals  and  metals  that  are
used in the products commonly covered in e-waste recycling mandates. Given
this,  Sony  suggests  adopting  legislation  to  target  all  products  that  contain
these same internal and external components and chemicals.

• Cost

Sony internalizes the cost of recycling and requests that any mandate require
the  same.  Currently,  Sony  pays  to  recycle  our  old  products.  While  there  are
several  financing  mechanisms  that  allow  for  recovery  of  this  cost,  Sony  be-
lieves  that  internalizing  the  cost  is  the  most  effective  and  fair  method  for
funding a comprehensive electronics recycling program. Such funding mecha-
nisms  create  market  incentives  for  manufacturers  to  ex  ante  design  and

scale to drive these recycling costs down, thus making recycling cost effective.
Until  that  time,  Sony  considers  the  cost  of  recycling  as  part  of  the  cost  of
doing business.

Q2. The  EPA  estimates  that  at  most,  only  15  percent  of  products  at  the  end  of  their
useful  lives  each  a  recycling  or  reuse  program.  This  does  not  come  as  a  shock
to me. In fact, it might seem a little high given the impediments that consumers
currently face.

Q2a. First, how are average consumers to know what to do with their e-waste when

it comes to the end of its useful life?

A2a. CONSUMER  EDUCATION:  Consumer  education  is  a  necessary  component
of  any  successful  e-waste  program,  and  that  is  why  Sony  uses,  as  noted  above,  a
wide range of methods to promote its take back program, including the use of print,
television,  and  radio  media.  We  also  use  our  50  regional  ‘‘recycling  events’’  to  edu-
cate  consumers  and  retailers  about  our  program  and  our  various  fixed  recycling  lo-
cations. Sony is also committed to cross-marketing and promotion with our national
take  back  partner,  WMI  and  various  government  and  non-governmental  organiza-
tions.
Q2b. This  past  weekend,  Washington,  D.C.  held  an  e-waste  recycling  day.  Over  ten
times  as  many  residents  as  last  year  showed  to  recycle  their  gadgets,  leading
to over two hours wait time. The incentives to recycle just don’t seem to be there
right now. What do you recommend be done to fix this problem?

A2b. OPTIMIZING RECYCLING: Sony’s goal is to make it as easy to recycle our
products as it is for our consumers to purchase them. Indeed, we want to make recy-
cling as effortless as throwing a product away. Simply stated, every additional step
that we require the consumer to take will result in a decrease in the recycling rate.
To optimize consumer recycling, we need curb-side collection of electronic waste just
as  we  do  with  other  types  of  waste.  This  collection  should  be  incorporated
seamlessly  into  the  existing  municipal  waste  collection  system.  Once  collected  and
consolidated, recyclers can efficiently process this electronics waste, thus creating a
stream of post-consumer material for reuse by manufacturers.
Q3. The  European  Union  is  often  ahead  of  the  United  States  when  it  comes  to  the
issue  of  recycling.  Where  do  U.S.  capabilities  stand  as  compared  to  Europe  on
the topic of e-waste?

A3. THE UNITED STATES VS. EUROPE: The United States has a greater capa-
bility  to  handle  e-waste  than  does  Europe.  The  issue  is  in  the  collection  of  elec-
tronics waste, not in the processing.
Q4. You mentioned in your testimony that Sony teamed up with Waste Management
to implement a national recycling initiative in the U.S. for e-waste. Many waste
companies  out  there  have  been  caught  throwing  away  recyclables  in  the  past.
What guarantees do you have from the company that the waste is actually being
recycled?

A4. PERCENT  OF  MATERIAL  RECYCLED:  As  part  of  its  contract  with  Sony,
WMI  guarantees  that  at  least  95  percent  of  the  material  collected  will  be  recycled.
Sony  also  has  the  right  to  audit  WMI’s  physical  locations  and  WMI’s  books  to  en-
sure  that  this  goal  is  achieved.  Lastly,  as  noted  above,  Sony  will  make  the  results
of its recycling effort fully transparent to the public.

Questions submitted by Representative Bob Inglis
Q1. Many manufacturers support a national solution to deal with e-waste; a federal
law  that  would  preempt  the  patchwork  of  State  and  local  laws  that  are  begin-
ning  to  crop  up.  Are  there  any  aspects  of  those  State  laws  that  would/should
be  expanded  to  the  national  level?  What  provisions  of  State  laws  in  place  now
would be detrimental to efforts dealing with e-waste if ramped up to a national
scale? Can you give an example or two of each?

A1. (a).  SONY’S  FUNDAMENTAL  RECYCLING  PRINCIPLE:  Sony  believes  in
‘‘full producer responsibility’’ in which a producer takes the responsibility for the re-
cycling  of  all  the  products  that  bear  its  brand  name.  Full  producer  responsibility,
however,  must  be  augmented  by  participation  in  the  process  by  other  stakeholders
and by reasoned application of the law. More specifically:

102

• Since  manufacturers  do  not  in  most  cases  directly  sell  their  products  to  con-
sumers, the collection of waste products is often best served by those who ini-
tially distribute the products (i.e., retailers).
• The  recycling  responsibility  must  be  forward-looking  rather  than  backward-
looking,  and  as  such,  any  obligation  must  be  based  upon  a  manufacturer’s
present  market  share.  As  explained  above,  collection  requirements  based
upon return share would give a significant advantage to those companies that
are new to the business.

(b).  POSITIVE  LESSONS  LEARNED  FROM  THE  STATES:  Sony  generally
supports  the  recycling  performance  standards  provisions  that  are  incorporated  in
the Minnesota and Washington State laws. More specifically, Sony believes that per-
formance standards should be based upon actual past performance instead of an ar-
bitrarily selected percentage. We feel that, similar to the Energy Star program, per-
formance  standards  should  reflect  the  best  of  what  the  industry  is  actually  doing.
Although  we  do  not  support  advanced  recovery  fees,  we  do  believe  that  much  can
be learned from the California State law. It has resulted in the development of one
of the most mature recycling and collection infrastructures in the United States and
has  identified  a  role  and  responsibility  for  retailers  which  many  of  the  other  State
laws tend to omit.

(c).  NEGATIVE  LESSONS  LEARNED  FROM  THE  STATES:  At  least  two  as-
pects  of  the  Maine  law  should  not  be  replicated  in  a  federal  bill.  Maine  bases  the
collection  responsibility  on  return  share,  thereby  giving  the  new  ‘‘no  name’’  brands
that flood the market an advantage over companies like Sony who were in business
40 years ago and who plan to stay in business for at (Past another 40 years. Maine
also  runs  the  program  as  a  tax  on  manufacturers  who  have  no  say  in  how  or  who
recycles  our  products;  we  simply  get  invoices  from  recyclers  selected  by  the  State
which we must pay in order to sell products in that state.
Q2. You state in your written testimony that Sony believes that internalizing the cost
of recycling in the price of your products is the most effective mechanism for re-
cycling  electronics.  Am  I  correct  to  say  that  this  means  that  a  small  amount  of
the  cost  to  consumers  would  be  directly  related  to  your  recycling  efforts?  If  this
is the case, how much does this internalization cost your customers?

A2. THE  COST  OF  RECYCLING:  The  cost  of  electronics  recycling  and  collection
today generally ranges from 25 to 50 cents per pound. Sony believes, however, that
if  a  single,  consistent  national  e-waste  program  is  created  electronics  recycling  can
become profitable. That is, a uniform program will establish economies of scale that
will  dramatically  improve  the  efficiency  of  e-waste  recycling.  This,  combined  with
the rise in the price of commodities, likely means cost internalization—and thus the
need to pass any such costs along to consumers—will be a short-term issue.

STATEMENT OF PARKER E. BRUGGE

VICE PRESIDENT, ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND

CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY

THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS ASSOCIATION

Introduction
Mr. Gordon, Mr. Hall and Members of the Committee:

My  name  is  Parker  Brugge  and  I  am  the  Vice  President,  Environmental  Affairs
and  Corporate  Sustainability  for  the  Consumer  Electronics  Association  (CEA).  CEA
is  the  preeminent  trade  association  promoting  growth  in  the  $161  billion  U.S.  con-
sumer electronics industry. CEA sponsors and manages the International CES—the
Nation’s  largest  annual  trade  event.  More  than  2,200  companies  enjoy  the  benefits
of  CEA  membership,  including  legislative  advocacy,  market  research,  technical
training  and  education,  industry  promotion  and  the  fostering  of  business  and  stra-
tegic  relationships.  Moreover,  CEA’s  members  include  manufacturers  of  consumer
electronics  products,  as  well  as  many  of  the  largest  retailers.  CEA  commends  the
Committee  for  holding  this  hearing  on  the  important  issue  of  electronics  recycling
and we appreciate the opportunity to provide the views of our membership.

By extending information and entertainment to everyone—regardless of income or
geographic  location—our  members’  products  have  improved  lives  and  changed  the
world. Meanwhile, America stands as the global leader in innovation, ingenuity and
creativity. In addition, the competition and falling prices characteristic of our indus-
try  continue  to  confer  benefits  to  consumers.  As  our  products  become  increasingly
affordable,  it  is  often  more  economical  for  consumers  to  replace  a  product  with  a
new one rather than repair older equipment.
Electronics  Recycling  is  Primarily  a  Resource  Recovery  and  Management

Issue

CEA concurs with the longstanding view of U.S. EPA officials that electronics re-
cycling is primarily a resource issue, not a toxicity issue. At a 2005 conference EPA’s
Director of the Office of Solid Waste said it succinctly:

EPA  is  confident  that  properly  managed,  modern  landfills  are  safe  for  disposal
of electronics, but there are a couple of problems: electronics waste doesn’t always
make it to safely run disposal sites, and more important, we don’t simply believe
it  makes  good  sense  to  landfill  or  throw  away  these  materials.  Certainly,  there
are  different  views  on  the  risks  of  electronics  (or  in  the  municipal  solid  waste
stream)—but  why  would  we  want  to  bury  heavy  metals  like  lead  or  cadmium
in landfills, where they will remain forever, at the same time as we unearth these
materials elsewhere in the world? We don’t have to agree how imminent the haz-
ards  are  from  our  landfills  here  in  the  U.S.  to  agree  that  this  practice  just
doesn’t make sense in the long-term.
Instead  this  is  an  issue  of  resource  conservation.  We  need  to  capture  valuable
materials to use them again, and to reduce the upstream environmental impacts
of extracting and refining virgin materials. . .1

CEA’s  view  of  electronics  recycling  as  a  resource  concern  in  no  way  diminishes
our call for good public policies to facilitate recycling of used electronics. But recog-
nizing this point does shed light on what policy approaches are most suitable to ad-
dress  this  problem.  Existing  regulatory  command  and  control  programs  such  as
RCRA  Subtitle  C  are  not  appropriate  for  facilitating  the  collection  and  recovery  of
used  electronics,  and  the  components  therein,  for  which  we  are  advocating  today.
CEA Supports Shared Responsibility for Recycling

CEA  advocates  strongly  for  a  shared  financial  responsibility  among  all  stake-
holders—manufacturers,  retailers,  consumers  and  local,  State  and  Federal  govern-
ments—for  electronics  recycling  at  all  levels  of  government.  Placing  the  financial
burden entirely on any one stakeholder is contrary to the concept of shared respon-
sibility which CEA believes is the best option for recycling financing.

A  primary  responsibility  of  manufacturers  lies  in  product  design.  Most  consumer
electronics  manufacturers  have  reduced  and,  in  most  cases,  greatly  minimized  the
use of potentially hazardous substances in their products. Additionally, manufactur-
ers have developed new ways to incorporate recycled components and design for re-
sponsible  end-of-life.  CEA  supports  market-driven  environmental  design  initiatives,

including Federal and State government programs that give preference towards pur-
chasing of environmentally preferable technology products.
CEA’s Members Are Committed to Electronics Recycling

CEA  and  its  member  companies  have  been  and  will  continue  to  be  fully  sup-
portive of the safe and appropriate recycling and reuse of consumer electronics prod-
ucts.  A  number  of  our  member  companies,  both  manufacturers  and  retailers,  have
initiated voluntary take-back activities to collect and recycle televisions, computers,
monitors and other consumer electronics.
CEA Supports Responsible Free Trade of Used Electronics

CEA  also  concurs  with  conclusions  of  U.S.  EPA  officials  regarding  the  export  of
used electronics, electronic parts and materials. First, CEA concurs that most reuse
markets  are  export  markets—that  is  where  most  of  the  demand  for  used  electronic
products  resides,  not  in  the  United  States.  Similarly,  CEA  concurs  that  many  recy-
cling  markets  are  also  located  primarily  abroad  for  a  variety  of  economic  and
logistical  reasons,  including  strong  foreign  demand  for  raw  materials  and  the  lack
of U.S. smelting and glass furnace capacity.

Rather than cutting off the export of used electronics, CEA supports the develop-
ment of responsible reuse and recycling systems both domestically and abroad. Used
consumer electronics, even scrap electronics, are not the industrial wastes for which
the Basel Convention was created. Used consumer electronics are old household ap-
pliances  that  consumers  no  longer  use  in  their  homes.  These  are  not  wastewater
treatment sludges or distillation bottoms that are appropriately regulated by RCRA,
Basel  Convention  and  similar  command  and  control  systems.  Rather  they  are  rem-
nants  of  past  consumer  technology  breakthroughs  made  up  primarily  of  aluminum,
steel,  silicon,  copper,  plastic  and  glass.  Whether  that  used  product  is  a  waste  or  a
bargain-priced product depends on the individual consumer. Common sense suggests
that  addressing  the  e-waste  problem  calls  for  a  different  approach  that  acknowl-
edges these facts and facilitates responsible commerce.

CEA also concurs with U.S. EPA’s conclusion that as collection of used electronics
in  the  U.S.  increases,  exports  will  increase  on  several  levels:  export  of  intact  units
for reuse, used parts for reuse, used equipment for refurbishment, intact equipment
for dismantling, partially processed materials for further processing, and fully proc-
essed  materials  for  use  as  raw  materials  in  manufacturing.  To  ensure  proper  reuse
and  recycling  of  used  electronics  here  and  abroad,  CEA  supports  efforts  to  increase
the monitoring of environmental performance at reuse/recycling facilities to increase
the  transparency  of  used  electronics  management.  CEA  looks  forward  to  working
with  other  interested  stakeholders  in  developing  environmentally  responsible  sys-
tems  for  the  export  of  used  electronics  for  reuse  and  recycling.  CEA  does  not  sup-
port,  whether  in  the  U.S.  or  abroad,  any  electronics  recycling  that  presents  unac-
ceptable risks to human health or the environment.
Impact of DTV Transition

With  the  DTV  cut-off  date  fast  approaching  (February  17,  2009),  the  topic  of  its
impact  on  televisions  entering  or  leaving  the  home  has  been  on  the  mind  of  many.
First, it’s worth a broad look at consumer expectations for removing TVs from their
home over the next few years. Results from CEA’s recent consumer survey ‘‘Trends
in  CE  Reuse,  Recycle  and  Removal’’  published  earlier  this  month  are  illuminating.
In  2008,  consumers  expect  to  remove  43.5  million  televisions  from  their  home.
Based on consumer reported plans, the removal will take place in the following way:
56  percent  of  the  TVs  will  be  given  away/donated,  25  percent  will  be  recycled,  13
percent will be sold and six percent will be thrown in the trash. The expected behav-
ior  follows  the  very  encouraging  trend  of  fewer  units  trashed  and  more  units  recy-
cled.

Beyond 2008, consumers expect to remove 41.9 million TVs in 2009 and 34.3 mil-
lion  2010.  These  figures  are  significantly  lower  than  the  2005  and  2007  aggregates
(64.6 million and 72.2 million respectively). Two factors may help explain this down-
ward  trend.  With  a  large  percentage  of  consumers  already  making  the  transition
from analog to digital, it may suggest a large volume of unwanted TVs have already
been removed from homes and we are now settling into an equilibrium period where
the  number  of  TVs  entering  and  leaving  the  home  is  roughly  balanced.  The  other
possible  explanation  centers  around  the  difficulty  consumers  have  in  predicting
their  behavior  over  an  extended  time  frame.  It’s  not  so  much  that  consumers  know
whether  or  not  they  will  remove  a  TV  from  their  home,  but  rather  the  timing  of
the removal.

Finally,  CEA  research  underscores  that  the  DTV  cut-off  will  impact  a  relatively
small  portion  of  the  U.S.  population—the  11  percent  of  households  that  rely  exclu-
sively on over-the-air television reception. Most households subscribe to cable or sat-

106

ellite, so the DTV cut-off is not really an issue for this segment (although some may
have  secondary  sets  in  their  home  that  rely  on  over-the-air  that  will  require  some
action to be taken).

With  consumers  projecting  fewer  televisions  to  remove  during  the  next  two  years
compared with previous calendar years, and with earlier CEA research showing that
the DTV cut-off will directly affect only a small fraction of U.S. households, the log-
ical  conclusion  is  that  the  DTV  cut-off  will  have  little  impact  on  the  waste  stream.
CEA Supports Consumer Education Initiatives

tronics. CEA works with our members to make these resources available and trans-
parent  to  all  interested  stakeholders.  We  will  continue  to  buoy  our  education  effort

CEA Supports a National Approach to Electronics Recycling

the  end-of-life,  CEA 

CEA  strongly  believes  that  a  national  solution  is  the  most  appropriate  means  to
addressing  this  significant  public  policy  challenge,  primarily  as  a  means  to  provide
consistency  in  recycling  opportunities  to  consumers  and  for  uniform  requirements
for  manufacturers  along  with  other  key  stakeholders.  Without  a  uniform  national
requirement, an ad-hoc array of State regulation imposes unnecessary financial and
administrative  burdens  on  global  technology  companies,  which  will  ultimately  in-
crease costs to consumers. Each state and municipality that creates a new authority
with  a  new  governing  body,  or  creates  a  new  administrative  or  enforcement  struc-
ture,  is  duplicating  many  of  the  implementation  struggles  already  underway  in
other  states  around  the  country.  Electronics  recycling  is  a  national  issue  that  war-
rants a national solution.

A national end-of-use framework should apportion responsibility among all of the
stakeholders  and  ensure  a  level  playing  field,  while  promoting  a  widespread  and
adequately financed electronics recycling solution.
Conclusion

Finding a solution to this public policy challenge is a priority for CEA. As we con-
tinue  to  make  strides  in  eco-friendly  design  initiatives,  lead  the  consumer  elec-
tronics industry on environmental issues and be a part of the effort to educate con-
sumers  about  electronics  recycling,  CEA  stands  ready  to  work  with  Congress  and
all  interested  parties  to  reach  a  common-sense,  national  solution  that  makes  recy-
cling as convenient as possible for all Americans.

Thank  you  again  for  the  opportunity  to  share  CEA’s  position  on  this  important

public policy issue.

STATEMENT OF MEGGAN L. EHRET
SENIOR COUNSEL AND SECRETARY

THOMSON INC.

Thank you Mr. Chairman and distinguished Members of the Committee for invit-
ing me to testify today. I am Meggan Ehret and I am Senior Counsel and Secretary
of  Thomson  Inc.  Thomson  Inc.  is  committed  to  developing  a  workable  and  environ-
mentally  sustainable  solution  for  electronic  recycling,  which,  according  to  the  EPA,
is the fastest growing portion of the municipal solid waste stream. We applaud this
committee  for  holding  this  hearing  to  explore  the  appropriate  treatment  for  elec-
tronic recycling and to ensure that the solution is a workable one that accomplishes
the goal. We appreciate the opportunity to participate in this discussion.

Thomson  is  committed  to  complying  with  all  environmental,  health,  and  safety
laws and regulations applicable to our business activities. We are equally committed
to preventing deterioration of the environment and minimizing the impact of our op-
erations  on  the  land,  air,  and  water.  These  commitments  can  only  be  met  through
the awareness and cooperation of all stakeholders. Today, Thomson is a world lead-
er in digital video technologies. Thomson provides technology, services, and systems
and equipment to help its Media & Entertainment clients—content creators, content
distributors,  and  users  of  its  technology—realize  their  business  goals  and  optimize
their  performance  in  a  rapidly-changing  technology  environment.  The  Group  is  the
preferred  partner  to  the  media  and  entertainment  Industries  through  its  Techni-
color, Grass Valley, RCA, and Thomson brands. As background, RCA’s stock was ac-
quired  by  General  Electric  in  1986,  and  shortly  thereafter  Thomson  bought  certain
consumer  electronics  assets  from  GE  and  eventually  acquired  the  RCA  trademark
(in  most  classifications)  and  today  licenses  the  trademark  to  a  number  of  different
companies  that  make  RCA  televisions  and  other  RCA-branded  products.  In  2004,
Thomson  sold  its  television  manufacturing  assets  and  now  licenses  the  RCA  trade-
mark to a television manufacturer.

When  considering  the  appropriate  approach  to  electronic  recycling,  we  ask  the
Committee to recognize and implement two key and important principles: first, com-
puters  and  televisions  warrant  different  treatment  and,  second,  financing  the  costs
associated  with  recycling  televisions  based  on  market  share  is  the  only  approach
that levels the playing field for television manufacturers.

First, based on our experience, we have learned that each product is different and,
of  direct  relevance  here,  there  are  the  differences  between  televisions  and  com-
puters.  The  different  product  life  expectancies,  market  economics,  residual  values,
and product portability necessitate different approaches to recycling to each product.
• Different  Product  Life  Expectancy—Televisions  have  an  average  useful
life  of  15  to  17  years  and  have  been  available  on  the  market  since  the  late
1920’s. Computers, on the other hand, have only been widely available to con-
sumers  since  the  1980’s  and  have  an  average  life  expectancy  of  at  least  10
years less than the average television. Because televisions have been in exist-
ence  much  longer  and  have  a  much  longer  life,  many  of  the  manufacturers
of  the  televisions  entering  the  waste  stream  are  either  no  longer  in  business
or are no longer manufacturing televisions.

impossible.’’)  Far  East  manufacturers  are 

• Different Market Economics—It is estimated that over 30 million TVs will
be  sold  in  2008  (U.S.  News  &  World  Report,  12/31/07).  Of  these,  many  will
be sold by value brands that have only been established in the past few years.
(‘‘Flat  Panels  Have  Poor  Fundamentals,’’  03/26/2007  stating  ‘‘The  rampant
competition  from  value  brands  like  Vizio  and  Westinghouse  has  undercut
prices of brand names like Sony, Philips and Panasonic by as much as 40 per-
cent. . .Sustaining  healthy  returns  on  capital  in  such  an  environment  is  al-

ers.’’  (The  Consumer  Electronics  Industry  in  Flux,  Gartner  Inc.  Research  Re-

(‘‘Behind the Glass,’’ March 2005), 70 percent of the television manufacturers
were  not  in  business  ten  years  ago.  By  the  time  a  new  market  entrant  must
pay  to  recycle  its  products  (approximately  15  years  from  today),  it  is  likely
no longer in business. Thus, requiring present-day TV manufacturers to fund
a TV recycling program based on their current market share ensures they are
not given a free pass until their branded products begin to appear in volume
in  the  State’s  recycling  stream  more  than  15  years  later  and,  in  some  in-
stances, at a time they are no longer in business.

• Different  Residual  Value—A  computer’s  residual  value  is  much  greater
than the typical cathode ray tube television. Computers contain precious met-
als  and  other  valuable  and  easily  recycled  or  reused  materials.  This  signifi-
cantly impacts the economics of recycling a television versus recycling a com-
puter.  A  recent  study  demonstrates  that  computer  recycling  creates  profit  or
costs a few cents per pound while televisions require thirteen to sixteen cents
a  pound  to  process  (not  including  costs  of  collection  or  transportation).
(NERIC 2008 Recycler Pricing Study, www.ecyclingresource.org).

• Different  Product  Portability—Computers  are  lighter  and  easier  to  han-
dle,  thus  different  opportunities  exist  for  collection  and  recycling.  Those  op-
portunities  do  not  exist  for  television  manufacturers.  Thus,  ‘‘take-back’’  pro-
grams  that  require  consumers  to  send  equipment  to  a  manufacturer  is  more
workable for computers than televisions.

These  important  differences  support  separate  approaches  to  recycling  programs
for  each  product.  Many  computer  manufacturers  have  already  implemented  ‘‘take-
back’’  programs  and  thus  requiring  take-back  programs  is  the  most  logical  and
workable  approach  for  computer  products.  For  televisions,  which  is  my  focus  today,
the  only  approach  that  levels  the  playing  field  and  maintains  the  competitive  mar-
ketplace  is  allocating  the  costs  of  a  recycling  program  to  the  present  day  manufac-
turers  based  on  each  manufacturer’s  respective  current  share  of  the  market.  It  is
a fairer approach for the following reasons:

• The  television  market  is  an  easy-entry  and  easy-exit  industry,  making  short-
term competitive advantages the rule. According to an article in Smart Money
Magazine (‘‘Behind the Glass,’’ March 2005), 70 percent of the television man-
ufacturers were not in business ten years ago. By the time a new market en-
trant  must  pay  to  recycle  its  products  (approximately  15  years  from  today),
it is likely no longer in business.

• Far  East  manufacturers  are  flooding  the  market.  ‘‘China. . .has  emerged  to
build consumer electronics. . .as a new manufacturer. Any company with the
resources  and  a  market  entry  point  can  deliver  product  relatively  quickly  by
contracting  with  the  original  design  manufacturers.’’  (The  Consumer  Elec-
tronics Industry in Flux, Gartner Inc. Research Report, November 16, 2005.).
History  has  proven  that  they  will  not  be  in  business  by  the  time  televisions
they  sold/manufactured  enter  the  waste  stream  and,  given  their  location,  en-
forcement or collection (particularly after they are out of business) will be dif-
ficult if not impossible, unless a barrier to entry to the market is contributing
to the costs of recycling televisions now.

• It  is  difficult—if  not  impossible—to  estimate  today  the  costs  associated  with
recycling televisions 15 years from now (e.g., collection, transportation and re-
cycling)  and  market  share  allocation  ameliorates  this  concern.  Thus,  allo-
cating  the  actual  costs  to  recycle  products  today  among  today’s  market  par-
ticipants  is  fair  and  permits  today’s  market  participants  to  plan  accordingly.
A  market  share  approach  requires  each  current  manufacturer  to  pay  for  a  share
of  the  recycling  of  discarded  televisions  based  on  its  respective  share  of  the  market
and  account  for  these  costs  in  the  price  of  their  product.  Any  other  alternative  will
give a free ride to new market entrants as they will not be required to pay any costs
for  recycling  today  and  history  has  demonstrated  that  they  will  be  out  of  business
in 15 years (which is when their products enter the waste stream). Thus, new mar-
ket  entrants  will  likely  never  pay  for  recycling  electronics.  Importantly,  as  a  result
of not having to factor in the cost of electronic recycling, they are able to price their
products lower than the long standing market participants and increase their share
of the market. This is the same conclusion reached by the Council of State Govern-
ments  NE 
(See  http://
www.csgeast.org/pdfs/RegionalDraft7-06¥—revised.pdf).  In  fact,  to  date,  there  are
only  two  states  that  have  adopted  electronic  recycling  laws  that  allocate  the  costs
of  recycling  televisions  based  entirely  on  return  share.  Those  are  Connecticut  and
Maine.  Connecticut’s  Senate  and  House  recently  passed  an  amendment  to  change
the  financing  for  the  costs  associated  with  recycling  television  to  market  share  and
the bill awaits the Governor’s signature.

region,  Minnesota,  New  Jersey,  and  Oregon. 

In  summary,  Thomson  respectfully  asks  that  this  committee  consider  allocating
the  costs  of  recycling  televisions  to  the  current  market  participants  based  on  their
respective  share  of  the  market,  thereby  leveling  the  playing  field  for  all  television
manufacturers and maintaining the competitive marketplace for television manufac-
turers. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to provide my comments to you.

STATEMENT OF THE OFFICE OF SOLID WASTE

AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE

U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to
provide  testimony  on  electronics  and  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency’s
(EPA’s) efforts to encourage more environmentally preferable electronics product de-
sign and recycling.

EPA’s  Resource  Conservation  Challenge  (RCC)  seeks  to  renew  the  emphasis  on
resource  conservation  under  the  Resource  Conservation  and  Recovery  Act  (RCRA)
and  the  emphasis  on  preventing  pollution  and  conserving  natural  resources  under
the  Pollution  Prevention  Act.  The  RCC  brings  greater  urgency  to  EPA’s  message  of
reducing,  reusing,  and  recycling  valuable  materials  habitually  discarded  by  Amer-
ican  industry  and  the  general  public  by  linking  the  importance  of  these  activities
to energy conservation and greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. One key area of focus
under the RCC is electronics.
WHY WE CARE ABOUT ELECTRONICS AT EPA

EPA  has  been  actively  helping  to  improve  the  design  and  recovery  of  electronics
for  more  than  ten  years.  Our  interest  in  electronics  stems  from  four  primary  con-
cerns:

1) rapid growth and change in this product sector, leading to a constant stream
of  new  product  offerings  and  a  wide  array  of  obsolete  products  needing  ap-
propriate management;

2) energy consumption by these products (the Energy Information Agency’s An-
nual  Energy  Outlook  2006  projects  that  electronics  will  a  count  for  19  per-
cent  of  residential  energy  use  by  2020,  compared  with  14  percent  of  home
energy consumption in 2006);

3) the presence of toxic substances in many products which can cause problem-
atic  exposures  during  manufacturing,  recycling  or  disposal,  if  not  properly
managed—the  presence  of  these  constituents  has  sparked  the  search  for
workable  substitutes  and  development  of  better  management  practices;  and
4) the need to ensure widespread, convenient and affordable reuse/recycling in-
frastructure  for  electronics  (with  initial  emphasis  on  TVs,  PCs  and  cell
phones)  and,  in  doing  so,  to  conserve  and  recover  the  large  amount  of  em-
bodied energy and valuable materials inherent in used electronics.

THE CHANGE IN TV TECHNOLOGY AND TRANSMISSION

Change is about to happen in the TV world. First, as prices come down for newer
models,  consumers  are  upgrading  from  the  old  cathode  ray  tube  style  of  TV  to
newer,  flat  screen,  high  definition  models  (such  as  LCD  and  plasma).  In  addition,
the  ‘‘Digital  Transition’’  is  around  the  corner.  On  February  17,  2009,  all  full-power
television stations will broadcast only in digital.1 Nielsen estimates that more than
13  million  households  have  TV  sets  that  only  receive  over  the  air  (OTA)  analog
broadcasts  and  an  additional  six  million  households  have  at  least  one  OTA  analog
television  set.2 Households  that  receive  free  over  the  air  television  broadcasts  on
analog TVs must take action by connecting their TV to a digital-to-analog converter
box, purchasing a digital television, or subscribing to a paid TV service.

Both  of  these  changes  are  raising  questions  about  how  many  old  TVs  will  find
their  way  to  the  recycling/disposal  path  in  the  near  future.  Some  are  predicting  a
‘‘tidal  wave’’  from  the  digital  transition.  More  likely,  however,  the  increase  will  be
gradual  over  a  several  year  time  frame  as  consumers  take  advantage  of  falling
prices for new TV technologies. The digital transition, by itself, is unlikely to cause
a  large  spike  in  TV  disposal.  This  is  because  fifty  percent  of  homes  already  have
digital  TV  so  will  receive  programming  after  the  changeover,  without  doing  any-
thing additional.3 In addition, those that have analog TV only, or other analog TVs
in the home, can either obtain digital-to-analog converters or cable service to extend
the  life  of  their  analog  TVs.  Furthermore,  some  homes  will  keep  analog  TVs  to  use
for gaming or movies, or hand them off to someone else who may want to use them
this way. There are many options, and it is unlikely that a sudden wave of TVs will
find  their  way  to  the  recycling/disposal  path  due  primarily  to  the  digital  transition

in  February  2009.  Still  the  digital  transition,  plus  the  move  to  adopt  new  TV  prod-
ucts,  will  mean  that  greater  collection  and  recycling  infrastructure  will  be  needed
to  properly  handle  these  TVs  as  they  emerge  from  homes  over  the  next  few  years.
WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT ELECTRONICS?

EPA is engaged in several broad scale partnerships with manufacturers, retailers,
other federal agencies, State and local governments, recyclers, non-government orga-
nizations  (NGOs)  and  others  to  encourage  and  reward  greener  design  of  electronic
products, to help develop the infrastructure for collection and reuse/recycling of dis-
carded  electronics,  and  to  promote  environmentally  safe  recycling  of  used  elec-
tronics. More detail about each of these efforts is provided below.
1) GREENING DESIGN OF ELECTRONICS
EPEAT:  EPA  funded  and  participated  in  a  multi-stakeholder  and  consensus-based
process,  involving  electronics  manufacturers,  large  government  IT  purchasers,
NGOs  and  others,  to  develop  the  Electronics  Product  Environmental  Assessment
Tool (EPEAT). Now codified as IEEE Standard 1680, EPEAT was launched in 2006
to  meet  growing  demand  by  large  institutional  purchasers  for  a  means  to  readily
distinguish  environmentally-preferable  desktop  and  laptop  computers  and  monitors
in  the  marketplace.  Modeled  on  other  environmental  rating  tools  like  the  Leader-
ship  in  Energy  and  Environmental  Design’s  (LEED’s)  Green  Building  Rating  sys-
tem,  EPEAT  includes  environmental  criteria  encompassing  the  product  life  cycle.
EPEAT  also  provides  a  system  for  registering  and  verifying  equipment  that  meets
its criteria. EPEAT-registered computers and monitors have reduced levels of toxics,
are  more  energy  efficient,  easier  to  upgrade  and  recycle,  and  use  more  sustainable
packaging than conventional equipment. EPA supported the development of EPEAT,
and  it  is  now  a  self-sustaining  system  operated  by  the  Green  Electronics  Council.
EPEAT has been a tremendous success. Even with recent upgrades to the EPEAT
criteria, there are more than 550 products from 26 manufacturers registered to the
EPEAT  standard.  In  the  first  six  months  the  system  was  in  place,  manufacturers
reported  selling  more  than  36  million  EPEAT-registered  products.  EPEAT  is  now
the  official  environmental  standard  for  electronics  in  all  federal  purchasing.  More
than six states and many other public and private purchasers are specifying EPEAT
equipment.

There  is  increasing  demand  for  EPEAT  to  expand  to  additional  products.  This
year,  EPA  is  funding  a  neutral  organization  to  convene  stakeholders  to  develop
standards  for  additional  electronic  products,  including  possibly  TVs.  EPA  has  com-
mitted  resources  to  help  develop  four  new  standards.  Interest  is  growing  in  using
EPEAT to promote greener electronics purchases by consumers.
ENERGY STAR: Starting as early as summer 2008, consumers will be able to pur-
chase  ENERGY  STAR  qualified  TVs  covering  all  of  today’s  screen  technologies,  in
all  sizes.  The  ENERGY  STAR  label  will  mean  these  products  are  up  to  30  percent
more  energy  efficient  in  both  standby  and  active  (when  they  are  on)  modes  than
conventional  models.  The  approximately  275  million  TVs  currently  in  use  in  the
U.S. consume over 50 billion kWh/year—or four percent of all households’ electricity
use.  When  coupled  with  digital  video  recorders,  they  account  for  about  13  percent
of an individual household’s electricity bill.

Energy  consumption  can  vary  greatly  among  different  models.  In  general,  the
larger the TV, the more energy it will consume. However, when similarly sized prod-
ucts are compared, projection units use the least energy, followed by LCD products,
with  plasma  products  using  the  most  energy.  EPA  will  make  available  on  the  EN-
ERGY STAR Web site an estimate of the annual kilowatt-hours (kWh) for all quali-
fied  TVs,  so  consumers  are  aware  of  the  amount  of  energy  the  TV  they  are  consid-
ering for purchase will use each year. On average, under the new requirements, an
ENERGY STAR qualified TV will save $35 off a consumer’s utility bills over the life
of the TV. If each TV purchased in the U.S. in one year were ENERGY STAR quali-
fied, we would prevent more than three billion pounds of greenhouse gas emissions
per year. This equals a savings of over two billion kWh and $250 million in energy
costs  and  reduces  greenhouse  gas  emissions  equal  to  taking  about  300,000  vehicles
off the road annually.4

On April 24, 2008, EPA announced a new specification for ‘‘boxes’’ that deliver tel-
evision  and  video  content,  also  called  set-top  boxes.  Effective  January  1,  2009,  new
cable,  satellite,  and  telecom  set-top  boxes  that  carry  the  ENERGY  STAR  will  be  at

(GHG)  reductions  and  dollars  saved.  For  GHG  conversions  used  by  the  Energy  Star  program,

least  30  percent  more  energy  efficient  than  conventional  models.  If,  after  this  new
specification  goes  into  effect,  all  set-top  boxes  sold  in  the  United  States  meet  the
Energy Star requirements, the savings in energy costs will grow to about $2 billion
each year and greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced by the equivalent of taking
about 2.5 million vehicles off the road annually.

Furthermore, EPA recently made the ENERGY STAR available for digital-to-ana-
log  converter  boxes  (DTA’s).  ENERGY  STAR  qualified  DTAs  are  eligible  for  pur-
chase  under  the  National  Telecommunications  and  Information  Agency’s  TV  Con-
verter  Box  Coupon  Program.  This  program  provides  consumers  coupons  to  save  on
the purchase of DTA’s so older TVs can continue to receive over-the-air broadcasting
after February 17, 2009. Consumers are encouraged to check that a product is both
a  coupon-eligible  converter  box  and  ENERGY  STAR  qualified  model  prior  to  pur-
chasing. Savings from an ENERGY STAR qualified DTA over a conventional model
are estimated to be up to 37 kWh annually or $4.
DESIGN FOR THE ENVIRONMENT (DfE): Over the years, EPA’s DfE Program
has  worked  with  the  electronics  industry  to  help  green  the  manufacturing  of  elec-
tronics, as well as electronics products themselves. DfE has worked with the indus-
try on ways to green the manufacture of printed wiring boards, assess the life cycle
impacts  of  CRTs  and  flat  panel  displays,  and  assess  substitutes  for  tin-lead  solder
that have acceptable engineering performance yet are less toxic, and pose the fewest
risks  over  their  life  cycle.  The  solder  life  cycle  assessment  generated  data  to  help
manufacturers, users, and suppliers incorporate environmental considerations when
choosing replacements for the 176 million pounds of leaded solder used annually in
the United States.

DfE  also  recently  completed  a  life  cycle  assessment  for  various  kinds  of  wire  and
cable  products  (including  network  and  low  voltage  cables).  The  study  results  will
help  companies  make  environmentally-informed  product  and  material  choices  and
will  identify  the  relative  contributions  of  various  processes  and  materials  to  the
overall impacts of the wire and cable products.
2) ENCOURAGING MORE REUSE AND RECYCLING
PLUG-IN  TO  eCYCLING:  Plug-In  to  eCycling  is  working,  through  partnerships,
to  expand  infrastructure  for  collection  and  safe  recycling  of  e-waste  nationwide.  In
2007,  EPA’s  Plug-In  partners  collected  more  than  47  million  pounds  of  electronics.
The  energy  conserved  through  these  recycling  efforts  is  equivalent  to  the  annual
GHG  emissions  of  taking  nearly  24,000  cars  off  the  road  annually.5 Since  the  part-
nership  began  in  2003,  Plug-In  partners  have  recycled  more  than  142  million
pounds  of  unwanted  consumer  electronics.  All  Plug-In  partners,  whether  they  recy-
cle electronics directly or contract with others for recycling services, are required to
abide  by  the  Plug-In  Guidelines  for  Materials  Management.  These  Guidelines  spell
out preferred recycling practices for used electronic products.

Plug-In partners continue to demonstrate innovation and creativity in sponsoring
collection events and take-back programs and reaching out to consumers. As an ex-
ample, Dell has expanded its Reconnect partnership with Goodwill Industries to in-
clude  select  cities  in  six  states.  Reconnect,  a  comprehensive  electronics  recovery,
reuse,  and  environmentally  responsible  recycling  opportunity  for  consumers,  is  now
providing electronics donation opportunities to several million households. Dell also
has  a  free,  online  computer  recycling  program  for  consumers  who  own  Dell  com-
puters.

In  2007,  Staples,  Office  Depot,  Hewlett  Packard,  and  Sony  also  launched  nation-
wide  eCycling  efforts.  The  Staples  program,  launched  in  May,  lets  consumers  drop
off  their  computers  and  other  electronic  office  equipment  at  any  of  the  company’s
1,400  U.S.  retail  locations.  Sony’s  Take  Back  Recycling  program,  launched  in  Sep-
tember 2007, allows consumers to take, free of charge, their unwanted Sony-branded
electronic products at 138 drop-off centers across the country run by Waste Manage-
ment eCycle America.

As part of its Plug-In to eCycling program, EPA teamed up with cell phone manu-
facturers,  service  providers,  and  retailers  in  2007  to  increase  America’s  cell  phone
recycling  and  donation  rate.  EPA  distributed  public  service  announcements  and
podcasts and increased publicity about available partner recycling programs.

5 EPA  calculates  these  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  equivalent  emissions  reductions  based  on  the
WARM model (Waste Reduction Model), following a life cycle assessment methodology using es-
timation techniques developed for national inventories of GHG emissions. See Solid Waste Man-
agement  and  Greenhouse  Gases:  A  Life-Cycle  Assessment  of  Emissions  and  Sinks  (EPA530–R–
06–004).  To  convert  GHG  equivalent  emissions  to  more  easily  understood  metrics,  such  as  cars
off  the  road,  gallons  of  gasoline,  etc.,  EPA  uses  the  Greenhouse  Gas  Equivalencies  Calculator
developed by the U.S. Climate Technology Cooperative.

These and other initiatives sponsored by industry, states, and recyclers are gener-
ating  critical  data  which  will  inform  policy-making  on  electronics  recycling.  These
innovations  are  crucial  to  learning  what  works,  what  does  not,  where  collaboration
is  possible  and  where  it  is  not,  what  kinds  of  opportunities  really  get  the  attention
of the consumer and what kind of material the consumer wants to recycle. And very
importantly, these projects clarify what it costs to get electronics from the consumer
into responsible recycling under varying circumstances.
FEDERAL  ELECTRONICS  CHALLENGE:  The  Federal  Government  is  a  very
large  purchaser  of  IT  products.  To  help  the  Federal  Government  lead  by  example
in  buying  green  electronics  and  managing  them  appropriately  at  the  end  of  their
useful life, the Federal Environmental Executive and the EPA launched the Federal
Electronics  Challenge  (FEC)  in  2004.  The  FEC  is  a  voluntary  partnership  program
designed  to  help  federal  agencies  become  leaders  in  promoting  sustainable  environ-
mental  stewardship  of  their  electronic  assets.  As  FEC  Partners,  federal  agencies
work  towards  goals  in  all  three  of  the  electronics  life  cycle  phases—acquisition  &
procurement; operations & maintenance; and end-of-life management.

In  2007,  the  President  signed  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  13423,  ‘‘Strengthening  Fed-
eral Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management.’’ E.O. 13423 consoli-
dates  and  strengthens  five  executive  orders  and  two  memorandums  of  under-
standing  related  to  Federal  Government  environmental,  energy,  and  transportation
performance  and  accountability,  including  electronics  stewardship  by  federal  agen-
cies.  CEQ  and  OMB  implementing  instructions  for  the  E.O.  were  issued  later  in
2007  requiring  that  all  federal  agencies  and  their  facilities  participate  in  the  FEC,
or an equivalent program.

Today, the FEC has 16 federal agency partners and 184 facility partners. Facility
partners reported many successes in 2007. These included 1) 80 percent of computer
desktops,  laptops  and  monitors  purchased  or  leased  were  EPEAT  registered,6 2)  86
percent  of  monitors  and  69  percent  of  computers  had  ENERGY  STAR  features  en-
abled,  and  3)  99  percent  of  non-reusable  computers  were  recycled  in  an  environ-
mentally-sound manner.

The Recycling Electronics and Asset Disposition (READ) services program assists
Federal agencies in assuring environmentally sound management of their electronic
discards. Managed by EPA, the READ program offers federal agencies access to re-
cycling  and  asset  disposition  services  providers  that  have  been  evaluated  to  ensure
that they recycle and properly dispose of excess or obsolete electronics in an environ-
mentally responsible manner.
3) WORKING TO IMPROVE ELECTRONICS RECYCLING
RESPONSIBLE  ELECTRONICS  RECYCLING  PRACTICES:  A  broad  group  of
stakeholders, including states, electronics manufacturers, electronics recyclers, trade
associations  and  public  interest  groups,  have  been  convened  to  develop  voluntary
‘‘responsible  recycling’’  (R2)  practices  for  electronics  recyclers,  and  a  process  for  as-
sessing  conformity  of  recyclers  with  these  practices.  We  expect  that  these  practices
will  be  implemented  by  private  organizations,  and  not  EPA.  The  dialogue  began  in
2006  and  has  resulted  in  a  set  of  draft  practices  that  has  been  reviewed  by  experi-
enced  facility  auditors  and  will  be  undergoing  field  testing  in  the  next  few  months.
However,  it  should  be  noted  that  these  draft  practices  have  not  been  agreed  to  by
the stakeholders and are likely to be further modified after field testing and further
discussions.

The current draft includes provisions for recyclers to 1) comply with all applicable
environmental,  health,  and  safety  legal  requirements,  2)  manage  used  and  end-of-
life  electronic  equipment  based  on  a  ‘‘reuse,  recover,  dispose’’  hierarchy  of  respon-
sible management strategies, 3) utilize practices at their facilities that protect work-
er health and safety and the environment, 4) manage the R2 ‘‘focus materials’’ that
pass through their facilities or under their control in a manner protective of worker
health and safety, public health, and the environment, and 5) perform due diligence
on  downstream  vendors  to  which  it  ships  these  materials,  including  those  that  are
exported  from  the  United  States.  ‘‘R2  focus  materials’’  are  materials  in  end-of-life
electronics equipment that warrant greater care because of potential hazards during
recycling, refurbishing, materials recovery, energy recovery, incineration, and/or dis-
posal.

After the practices have been field tested, the stakeholder group expects to revisit
and  revise  the  practices  based  on  information  and  recommendations  gathered  dur-

6 The Federal Acquisition Regulations requirement that 95 percent of applicable federal infor-

ing the field testing process, and to make other changes as appropriate. EPA is also
conducting  research  on  electronics  recycling  that  includes  environmental  sampling
and  characterization  of  an  electronics  recycling  facility.  Data  from  this  testing  will
assist  the  stakeholders  in  adopting  practices  to  comply  with  applicable  environ-
mental requirements.
EXPORTS MANAGEMENT: It is well known that electronics material collected in
the  United  States  and  other  developed  countries  is  exported  to  foreign  countries.
Some are concerned that this amounts to ‘‘exporting harm,’’ because electronics ma-
terials  have  been  mishandled  in  some  of  the  receiving  locations.  Those  that  object
to  exports  of  used  electronics  point  to  the  coming  digital  transition  and  consumer
upgrading  to  new  TV  technologies  (e.g.,  LCD,  plasma,  flat  screens)  and  the  insuffi-
cient  infrastructure  in  the  U.S.  to  process  these  materials  as  evidence  that  abuses
abroad will only worsen. However, it must be recognized that while there have been
demonstrated  problems,  export  of  electronics  collected  is  a  necessary  and  useful
function, and important work is underway to ensure that these exports are managed
appropriately at their destination. Also, it should be understood that without export
of  electronics  as  an  option,  most  of  the  electronics  in  the  United  States  would  be
disposed.

Used  electronics  can  be  exported  to  other  countries  for  the  purpose  of  continued
use  or  recycling.  It  is  difficult  to  generate  good  estimates  of  how  much  used  and
scrap  electronics  are  exported  for  reuse  and  recycling,  because  data  on  export  vol-
umes  is  not  always  required  to  be  reported.  However,  EPA  has  attempted  to  quan-
tify  the  amount  of  CRT  TVs  and  monitors  that  are  exported  for  reuse  or  recycling.
We  estimate  that  more  than  80  percent  of  CRT  devices  (including  materials  such
as processed glass resulting from processing CRTs in the U.S.) that are collected for
reuse or recycling are sent to foreign markets.

Given  the  concerns  expressed  by  some  about  improper  handling  of  electronics
abroad,  should  there  be  any  export  at  all?  There  are  examples  of  unsafe  recycling
practices  in  some  areas  of  the  world  where  dismantling  occurs  in  unregulated  and
uncontrolled cottage industry conditions. However, there are also benefits associated
with export of this material. Much of what goes abroad is whole equipment or com-
ponents for reuse. This reuse avails many people in developing countries with infor-
mation  technology  that  would  otherwise  be  unaffordable  for  them.  Materials  such
as  plastics  or  metals  derived  from  electronics  and  processed  in  the  United  States
make  up  another  large  portion  of  the  amount  exported.  These  ‘‘scrap’’  commodities
are  in  high  demand  overseas  as  raw  materials  for  manufacturing.  Because  most
electronics  are  manufactured  abroad,  using  materials  from  discarded  electronics  in
the  manufacture  of  new  electronics  cannot  occur  unless  the  raw  materials  are  sent
back to where the products are manufactured.

Without  international  markets,  many  of  the  efforts  currently  underway  in  the
United  States  to  divert  obsolete  electronics  away  from  disposal  and  toward  reuse
and recycling could not be sustained. For example: 1) there are no smelters/refiners
in  the  United  States  to  convert  copper  and  precious  metal  (gold,  silver,  palladium)
bearing electronics into metals that are pure enough for use; 2) there are no longer
any  cathode  ray  tube  (CRT)  glass  furnaces  in  the  Western  Hemisphere  for  use  of
recycled CRT glass; 3) nearly all markets for plastics from electronics are overseas,
primarily in Asia; and 4) the major markets for reuse (of both whole equipment and
components) are outside the United States, mostly in developing countries.

At the same time, EPA is taking steps to improve the management of electronics
sent abroad for management. This is particularly relevant to concerns that evolution
to new TV technologies which will increase the number of old TVs available for end-
of-life  management.  EPA’s  new  CRT  rule  requires  exporters  of  CRTs  for  reuse  to
file  a  one-time  notification  with  EPA  stating  that  they  plan  to  export  CRTs  for
reuse.  The  rule  also  requires  persons  who  export  CRTs  for  reuse  to  keep,  for  not
less  than  three  years,  copies  of  business  records  demonstrating  that  each  shipment
of  exported  CRTs  will  be  reused.  This  requirement  provides  United  States  regu-
latory authorities the opportunity to inspect these records in order to verify that the
CRTs  were  actually  sent  to  legitimate  reuse  or  refurbishment  entities.  For  export
of CRTs and unprocessed CRT glass for recycling (as opposed to reuse), the rule re-
quires both notification to EPA of the intended export and consent by the receiving
country. These regulations are relatively new, and we are still in the process of im-
plementing  the  requirements.  These  new  requirements  promise  to  ensure  signifi-
cantly better control over CRTs exported for recycling.

We also have several initiatives that promote safe management of used electronics
exported  for  recycling,  including  the  Plug-In  guidelines  for  sound  reuse  and  recy-
cling of electronic products and the multi-stakeholder dialogue to issue ‘‘responsible
recycling’’  practices  for  incorporation  into  a  certification  program  for  e-waste  recy-

clers,  both  of  which  have  previously  been  discussed  in  the  testimony.  EPA  also  led
the  development  of  international  guidelines  on  the  sound  use  and  recycling  of  per-
sonal  computers  by  the  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development
(OECD).  We  participated  in  a  Basel  Convention  partnership  effort  with  industry
that  is  developing  guidelines  for  the  safe  reuse,  recycling  and  transboundary  move-
ment  of  used  and  scrap  mobile  phones.  Finally,  we  are  a  participant  in  a  working
group  of  international  stakeholders  of  academia,  trade  associations,  industry  and
governments—called  the  StEP  initiative—to  identify  voluntary  activities  that  pro-
mote sound reuse and safe recycling, especially concerning the transboundary flows
of electronics.

With  global  markets  being  essential  to  sustainable  and  sound  management  of
electronics,  the  key  is  to  continue  to  work  towards  assuring  that  management  of
electronics  at  their  end-of-life  is  protective  of  human  health  and  the  environment
whenever  and  wherever  it  takes  place.  EPA  is  committed  to  continuing  its  ongoing
efforts in this regard.
Conclusion

EPA appreciates the Committee’s interest in this issue and the opportunity to dis-
cuss  the  Agency’s  electronics  goals,  what  efforts  are  currently  underway,  and  how
EPA works with partners throughout the product chain to achieve shared responsi-
bility for a greener, recovery-oriented product cycle.

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS FOR WRITTEN SUBMISSION

BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. How  much  funding  has  EPA  allocated  for  the  development  of  the  Electronics
Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) standards for televisions and
when will this funding be given to the Green Electronics Council to develop these
standards?

A1. The  Green  Electronics  Council  is  not  the  developer  of  EPEAT  standards.  The
Council maintains the EPEAT Product Registry and conducts verification to help en-
sure  products  meet  the  EPEAT  Standard  criteria  and  markets  EPEAT  to  pur-
chasers. Rather, EPA will be awarding a $300,000 four year cooperative agreement,
which will pay for 50 percent of the costs of managing the process of developing four
new  product  standards—imaging  equipment,  televisions,  servers,  and  cell  phones/
PDAs: The recipient of this cooperative agreement will facilitate the development of
these new standards through a multi-stakeholder voluntary consensus process. EPA
provided  partial  funding  under  the  Pollution  Prevention  Program/Project  (502C95)
in  EPA’s  Environmental  Programs  Management  appropriation  for  this  work  due  to
limited resources and a belief that other stakeholders needed to jointly-fund the de-
velopment  of  standards  which  meet  their  needs.  The  EPA  cooperative  agreement  is
in  the  final  stages  of  obtaining  Agency  approval,  and  is  scheduled  to  be  awarded
in the summer of 2008.
Q2. EPA  states  in  its  testimony  that  ‘‘starting  as  early  as  2008,  consumers  will  be
able  to  purchase  ENERGY  STAR  qualified  TVs.’’  Is  ENERGY  STAR  available
now for televisions?
• EPA states in its testimony that ‘‘. . . they [TVs and digital recording devices]
account  for  about  13  percent  of  an  individual  household’s  electricity  bill.’’
Given  this  high  energy  usage,  why  has  the  ENERGY  STAR  program  been  so
slow to expand the program to televisions?

• The Committee heard testimony at the hearing, that the production of an elec-
tronics  product  uses  considerably  more  energy  than  the  energy  use  over  the
product’s lifetime. Why hasn’t EPA added a provision to ENERGY STAR that
would  help  consumers  assess  and  compare  the  embodied  energy  of  electronics
products?

Q2a. Is ENERGY STAR available now for televisions?
A2a. EPA  has  had  ENERGY  STAR  requirements  for  TVs  since  1998.  Version  2.2
of these requirements is in place now and more than 2,200 TV models have earned
the  ENERGY  STAR  label.  In  November  2008,  EPA’s  new  Version  3.0  requirements
for  TVs  will  go  into  effect.  These  new  requirements  ensure  that  TVs  are  more  en-
ergy efficient in all modes of operation. In order to qualify for ENERGY STAR, TVs
must  be  tested  using  the  internationally  vetted  and  supported  On  Mode  test  proce-
dure for TVs (IEC 62087).
Q2b. EPA states in its testimony that ‘‘. . . they [TVs and digital recording devices]
account for about 13 percent of an individual household’s electricity bill.’’ Given
this  high  energy  usage,  why  has  the  ENERGY  STAR  program  been  so  slow  to
expand the program to televisions?

A2b. ENERGY STAR has addressed what was the significant contribution TVs his-
torically made to a household’s electricity bill (i.e., standby power consumption). As
TV  technology  and  usage  patterns  have  changed,  EPA  contributed  to  the  develop-
ment  of  an  internationally  accepted  ‘‘On  Mode’’  test  procedure  and  incorporated  re-
quirements  into  ENERGY  STAR  to  address  power  consumption  across  all  modes  of
TV operation. With these new requirements, if all TVs sold in the United States met
ENERGY STAR requirements,1 the savings in energy costs would grow to about $1
billion annually.

Standby  power  consumption  remains  a  focus  of  the  ENERGY  STAR  program  as
U.S.  households  spend  $100  per  year  to  power  devices  while  they  are  in  a  standby
power  mode—roughly  eight  percent  of  household  electricity  costs.  Consumer  elec-
tronics, including audio, video and telephone products account for 40 percent of low
power mode consumption (roughly $40 per household per year).

1 As of 2015 and thereafter.

Q2c. The  Committee  heard  testimony  at  the  hearing  that  the  production  of  an  elec-
tronics  product  uses  considerably  more  energy  than  the  energy  use  over  the
product’s  lifetime.  Why  hasn’t  EPA  added  a  provision  to  ENERGY  STAR  that
would  help  consumers  assess  and  compare  the  embodied  energy  of  electronics
products?

A2c. EPA  has,  to  date,  focused  on  the  savings  available  to  consumers  by  reducing
the  power  draw  of  products  they  use  in  their  homes  and  workplaces.  Through  this
focus, Americans, with the help of ENERGY STAR, prevented 40 million metric tons
of greenhouse gas emissions in 2007 alone and saved more than $16 billion on their
utility bills.

The program is committed, however, to achieving additional savings. For example,
ENERGY STAR initially focused on achieving greater efficiency while products were
in  low  power  mode  as  there  was  an  opportunity  to  deliver  significant  savings  in  a
cost  effective  manner.  In  recent  years,  EPA  has  turned  its  attention  to  On  Mode
power consumption for many product categories as their power consumption in this
mode  has  become  a  more  significant  portion  of  the  products’  overall  consumption
and  meaningful  savings  were  measurable  and  achievable.  A  sister  program  to  EN-
ERGY  STAR,  EPA’s  Climate  Leaders  program,  has  challenged  partners  to  reduce
their  carbon  footprint,  including  that  which  is  associated  with  the  manufacture  of
products like TVs.

EPA is considering how the Agency can weigh products’ embodied energy, as well
as the product’s in-use performance against a range of other environmental criteria
when  recognizing  products  as  environmentally  preferable.  This  effort,  underway
now,  will  align  with  ENERGY  STAR’s  guiding  principles—engaging  key  stake-
holders, and building on existing data.
Q3. When did EPA begin its Design for the Environment (DfE) program? How much
funding  has  gone  to  the  initiative  since  its  inception  (by  year)  and  how  much
has  been  specifically  devoted  to  electronics  products  (by  year)?  How  much  fund-
ing did EPA request for these activities in FY 2008 and FY 2009?
• Please  list  the  electronics  producers  EPA  has  worked  with  through  the  DfE
program.  How  has  EPA  worked  with  electronics  recyclers  or  facilitated  dia-
logue  between  electronics  producers  and  electronics  recyclers  through  the  DfE
program?
• How  are  tools  like  the  solder  life  cycle  assessment  and  the  wire  and  cable  life
cycle assessment used by manufacturers? Can you please provide us with some
specific success stories from the WE program?

Q3a. When did EPA begin its Design for the Environment (DfE) Program?
A3a. The  Office  of  Pollution  Prevention  and  Toxics’  Design  for  the  Environment
(DfE)  Program  was  established  in  1992.  More  information  on  the  DfE  Program  is
available at www.epa.gov/dfe.
Q3b. How  much  funding  has  gone  to  the  initiative  since  its  inception  (by  year)  and
how  much  has  been  specifically  devoted  to  electronics  projects  (by  year)?  How
much  funding  did  EPA  request  for  these  activities  in  FY  2008  and  FY  2009?
A3b. Year-by-year  funding  for  DfE  and  for  DfE  electronics  projects  is  provided  in
Attachment A. The attachment also provides the President’s budget request for DfE
for  fiscal  years  2008  and  2009.  All  DfE  resources  are  housed  in  the  Pollution  Pre-
vention  Program/Project  (502C95)  in  EPA’s  Environmental  Programs  Management
appropriation.
Q3c. Please list the electronics producers EPA has worked with through the DfE Pro-

gram.

A3c. Attachment  B  includes  the  electronics  manufacturers  who  have  played  a  sig-
nificant role in DfE partnerships. Also in this list are suppliers to electronic manu-
facturers  who  have  provided  input  in  the  dialogue.  These  include  manufacturers  of
printed circuit boards, flame retardants, and resins. After the industry partners, we
list other significant participants.
Q3d. How has EPA worked with electronics recyclers or facilitated dialogue between

electronics producers and electronics recyclers through the DfE Program?

A3d. Multi-stakeholder  engagement  is  central  to  DfE’s  approach;  DfE  engages  in-
dustry,  environmentalists,  and  others.  These  stakeholders  help  EPA  to  define
project  goals  and  scope,  and  enable  EPA  to  understand  and  account  for  the  broad
range  of  concerns  and  issues  associated  with  exploring  alternative,  safer  chemicals,
more efficient processes, and preferable product end-of-life scenarios.

Recyclers  have  shown  great  interest  in  DfE  projects.  For  example,  in  the  case  of
the  ongoing  EPA  Flame  Retardants  in  Printed  Circuit  Boards  Partnership,  copper
smelters participated in scoping and design of the partnership and are now working
with  us  to  conduct  the  work.  Copper  smelters  have  helped  DfE  and  the  full  stake-
holder group to understand how the smelting process works, and the printed circuit
board constituents that may cause concern for the industry. The smelters have been
very  helpful  in  designing  a  study  to  understand  the  unintended  byproducts  that
may result from combustion.
cycling Industries, Inc., gave DfE their Design for Recycling Award in 2007.
Q3e. How  are  tools  like  the  solder  life  cycle  assessment  and  the  wire  and  cable  life

Based on our partnership work involving their industry, the Institute of Scrap Re-

cycle assessment used by manufacturers?

A3e. DfE Lead-Free Solder Partnership

The study results have provided the industry with an objective analysis of the life
cycle  environmental  impacts  of  leading  candidate  alternative  lead-free  solders,  and
have  allowed  the  industry  to  redirect  efforts  towards  products  and  processes  that
reduce  solders’  environmental  footprint.  The  electronics  industry  has  substantially
reduced  the  use  of  lead  in  electronics  since  this  study  began.  More  information  can
be found at www.epa.gov/dfe/pubs/projects/solder/index.htm.

DfE Wire & Cable Partnership

Opportunities  for  improvement  of  environmental  performance  in  wire  and  cable
products were identified in the Life Cycle Assessment, focusing primarily on energy
efficiency,  and  recycling  of  chopped  cable  resin.  For  example,  electricity  generation
for  raw  material  production  and  cable  extrusion  were  a  large  part  of  the  environ-
mental  burden  of  wire  and  cable  products.  Finding  opportunities  to  reduce  energy
inputs would likely have a large effect on the overall environmental burden of wire
and cable products. Also, increased recycling of chopped cable resin, although an en-
ergy-intensive  process,  would  decrease  the  potential  impacts  associated  with  land-
filling  and  incineration.  The  draft  final  LCA  is  now  posted  on  the  DfE  web  site  for
public comment. Please see: www.epa.gov/dfe.
Q3f. Can  you  please  provide  us  with  some  specific  success  stories  from  the  WE  Pro-

gram?

A3f. Below are success stories from the DfE Program.

Informed  Substitution:  Safer  Flame  Retardants  for  Furniture  and  Printed  Circuit

Boards

DfE’s Furniture Flame Retardancy Partnership was initiated in response to stake-
holder concerns with the occurrence of pentabromodiphenyl ether (pentaBDE) in the
environment and human tissues. PentaBDE was the primary flame retardant in the
manufacture  of  low-density,  flexible  polyurethane  foam  for  furniture,  with  produc-
tion levels of approximately 19 million pounds per year.

To ensure that decisions were made based on the best information available, and
to  minimize  the  chance  of  unintended  consequences,  DfE  brought  together  a  multi-
stakeholder  group  to  consider  the  move  to  alternative  chemicals.  In  consultation
with  this  group,  DfE  developed  an  alternatives  assessment  methodology  for  evalu-
ating  alternative  flame  retardants  based  on  the  tools  and  expertise  of  the  Office  of
Pollution Prevention and Toxics.

DfE  evaluated  14  commercially-available  alternative  flame  retardant  formula-
tions. The outcome of the partnership was a move to alternative flame retardant for-
mulations.  The  results  from  this  partnership  were  used  by  foam  manufacturers,  in
the  period  leading  up  to  the  voluntary  December?2004  phase-out  of  production  of
pentaBDE, in choosing alternative flame retardants. These efforts complemented an
EPA  Significant  New  Use  Rule  (SNUB)  under  the  Toxic  Substances  Control  Act—
a regulatory backstop to require notification to EPA before restart of U.S. manufac-
ture or import of pentaBDE for any use.

Please  see:  http://www.epa.gov/dfe/pubs/projects/flameret/index.htm  for  more

information.

DfE’s Printed Circuit Board Partnership

DfE is now working with the electronics industry, the chemical industry, and en-
vironmental  groups  to  adapt  the  technical  methodology  described  above  to  elec-
tronics  applications.  The  Printed  Circuit  Board  Flame  Retardancy  Partnership  was
convened to better understand the environmental health and safety aspects of com-

DfE Formulator Safer Product Recognition Program

EPA  allows  safer  products  to  carry  the  Design  for  the  Environment  (DfE)  label.
This  mark  allows  consumers  to  quickly  identify  and  choose  products  that  can  help
protect  the  environment  and  are  safer  for  families.  When  you  see  the  DfE  logo  on
a product it means that the DfE scientific review team has screened each ingredient
for potential human health and environmental effects and that—based on currently
available  information,  EPA  predictive  models,  and  expert  judgment—the  product
contains only those ingredients that pose the least concern among chemicals in their
class.

Product  manufacturers  who  become  DfE  partners,  and  earn  the  right  to  display
the DfE logo on recognized products, have invested heavily in research, development
and  reformulation,  to  ensure  that  their  ingredients  and  finished  product  line  up  on
the  green  end  of  the  health  and  environmental  spectrum,  while  maintaining  or  im-
proving product performance.

More  than  100  manufacturers  have  met  DfE’s  criteria  for  displaying  the  logo  on
more  than  500  products,  including:  Clorox,  Method,  SC  Johnson  and  Son,  Colgate
Palmolive, Dial Corporation, SYSCO, and Corporate Express. Additionally, retailers
such as WalMart and Home Depot ask their suppliers to work with DfE. Visit http:/

Q4. When did EPA begin its Plug-In To eCycling program? Since its inception, how
much funding has EPA requested for this program (by year) and how much has
been allocated (by year)? What specific activities are funded under this program,
and what activities does EPA carry out?
• In  its  testimony,  EPA  states  that  these  ‘‘initiatives  sponsored  by  industry,
states, and recyclers are generating critical data which will inform policy-mak-
ing on electronics recycling.’’ Please provide some examples of the critical data
generated  and  how  it  will  inform  policy-makers.  What  is  EPA’s  role  in  col-
lecting and processing this information?

for  more 

A4. In  2003,  EPA  launched  the  Plug-In  To  eCycling  partnership  program  to  work
with electronics manufacturers and retailers to offer consumers increased opportuni-
ties to donate or recycle—‘‘eCycle’’—their used electronics. The program’s initiatives
are intended to reflect shared responsibility among manufacturers, retailers, govern-
ments  and  consumers.  These  initiatives  seek  to  demonstrate  how  voluntary,  indus-
try-led  models  or  public-private  partnerships  can  complement  existing  state  or  mu-
nicipality-led  collection  and  recycling  efforts.  Plug-in  initiatives  also  inform  policy-
making  on  electronics  recycling  by  demonstrating  what  works  and  what  does  not
(e.g.,  how  best  to  encourage  consumer  participation,  what  various  approaches  cost).
Over  the  past  five  years,  the  Plug-In  program  has  grown  to  include  25  industry
partners.  Through  their  collective,  voluntary  efforts,  partners  have  recycled  more
than 142 million pounds of unwanted consumer electronics.

Since  its  inception,  Plug-In  To  eCycling  has  been  allocated  approximately
$742,0002 in  funding  ($207,000,  $125,000,  $100,000*,  $100,000*,  $100,000,  and
$110,000  for  fiscal  years  2003–2008,  respectively).3 The  Plug-In  program  is  not  in-
cluded as a separate item in our program budget requests, but it is one of the many
activities  over  the  years  that  we  implement  during  the  budget  year  to  foster  im-
proved end-of-life management of electronics, as described in our Congressional Jus-
tifications.

With  these  funds,  Plug-In  To  eCycling  carries  out  the  following  functions:  1)  pro-
viding  information  to  educate  and  encourage  the  public  to  increase  participation  in
electronics  recycling,  2)  facilitating  partnerships  to  increase  opportunities  for  con-
sumers to recycle their used electronics; 3) researching ways that manufacturers can
collaborate to help manage collection and recycling of e-waste; and 4) supporting ef-

2 In FY07 and FY08 we funded this out of 301DA2—Waste Minimization and Recyling funds.
3 For  FY  2005  and  2006,  Plug-In  was  not  itemized  in  the  operating  plan  budget.  It  was  in-

forts  to  quantify  the  environmental  benefits  of  electronics  recycling.  Specific  activi-
ties that have been undertaken include:

• To  increase  public  awareness  of  the  opportunities  to  donate  and  recycle  used
electronics  and  the  environmental  benefits  of  doing  so,  Plug-In  has  created  a
variety  of  outreach  tools,  including:  an  eCycling  event  toolkit,  brochures,  fly-
ers,  web  pages,  public  service  announcements,  podcasts,  and  a  short  video
promoting  computer  reuse.  Earlier  this  year,  Plug-In  launched  the  Recycle
Your  Cell  Phone.  It’s  an  Easy  Call.  campaign  to  highlight  the  many  opportu-
nities  for  consumers  to  recycle  their  cell  phones.  In  just  two  weeks,  the  cam-
paign received over 10,000,000 media impressions from national outlets, such
as AP, the New York Times, NPR and Reuters and this earned media valued
at  over  half  a  million  dollars.  Outreach  activities  help  to  raise  public  aware-
ness  of  the  importance  of  electronics  recycling  and  stimulate  participation  in
existing recycling programs.
• Plug-In  has  supported  the  development,  implementation,  and  evaluation  of
four  pilot  projects  to  assess  different  approaches  to  effective  collection  tech-
niques  for  end-of-life  electronics.  These  pilots  included  retail  take-back  pilots
involving Staples, Good Guys, Office Depot, and Best Buy and researched the
creation of manufacturer-led third party organizations to coordinate collection
and  recycling.  The  lessons  learned  and  data  collected  from  participating  in
the pilot projects enabled the retail partners to test the feasibility of collecting
used  electronics  in  a  retail  setting  and  understand  the  degree  to  which  the
reverse  distribution  collection  approach  could  be  part  of  the  company’s  sus-
tainable business model. For example, based on the experience gained and the
success  of  its  pilot  project,  Staples  has  since  expanded  their  program  nation-
wide.  The  retail  pilots  have  demonstrated  that  retailers  are  potent  partners
in  educating  and  incentivizing  consumers  to  recycle  by  providing  them  with
convenient drop-off outlets and offering them attractive rebates and discounts
on  the  purchase  of  new  products  when  they  bring  in  an  old  product  for  recy-
cling.  The  research  on  manufacturer-led  third  party  organizations  illustrates
how  consortia  of  manufacturers  can  pool  their  resources  and  business  exper-
tise  to  provide  efficient  and  effective  take-back  services.  These  lessons  are
being  applied  in  such  states  as  Washington  and  Minnesota,  two  states  that
are  encouraging  manufacturer  collaborations  on  take-back.  All  of  these  pilots
have  helped  to  expand  collection  and  recycling  not  only  in  states  that  have
electronics recycling requirements, but states that do not.
• EPA  created  the  Plug-In  To  eCycling  Guidelines  for  Materials  Management,
which  serves  as  national  guidance  for  the  safe  management  of  used  elec-
tronics. These Guidelines have allowed EPA and Plug-In partners to gain ex-
perience  and  information  about  what  practices,  will  most  effectively  protect
human  health  and  the  environment,  while  at  the  same  time  enabling  prac-
ticable programs for the management of used electronics. The Guidelines have
also  served  as  a  basis  for  the  development  of  the  ongoing  effort  to  formulate
consensus ‘‘Responsible Recyclers Practices.’’ 4
• EPA  has  collaborated  with  the  National  Center  for  Electronics  Recycling
(NCER)  to  help  populate  NCER’s  database  on  electronics  collection.  Plug-In
To  eCycling  partners  are  being  asked  to  share  their  data  with  NCER.  The
centralized  database,  designed  by  a  range  of  key  stakeholders  in  conjunction
with the NCER and EPA, is intended to provide recycling program designers
and managers, as well as policy-makers, with information on electronics recy-
cling program structure, costs, and results.
• Plug-In  has  contributed  to  the  broader  EPA  effort  to  develop  the  Electronics
Environmental  Benefits  Calculator  (EEBC).  The  Calculator  estimates  the
benefits  of  environmentally  sound  management  of  electronic  equipment  from
purchase to use to end-of-life management. With this tool, a user can quantify
and articulate the environmental benefits of their electronics recycling activi-
ties in terms of greenhouse gas reductions and energy savings.

Q5. Regarding the export of used electronics, EPA’s testimony states, ‘‘. . . it should
be  understood  that  without  export  of  electronics  as  an  option,  most  of  the  elec-
tronics  in  the  United  States  would  be  disposed.’’  Does  this  mean  disposed  of  in

4 EPA is working with stakeholders (i.e., states, electronic manufacturers, recyclers, trade as-
sociations  and  public  interest  groups)  to  develop  one  agreed  upon  set  of  practices  that  can  be
used in a voluntary certification program which assures the environmental performance of elec-
tronic  recyclers.  This  certification  program  is  expected  to  be  run  by  private  organizations,  not
EPA.

a  landfill,  incinerated;  or  by  some  other  means?  Is  the  recycling  infrastructure
in the U.S. sufficiently robust to handle the volume of used electronics generated
in this country?
• EPA  also  states  in  its  testimony  that  ‘‘important  work  is  underway  to  ensure
that  these  exports  are  managed  appropriately  at  their  destination.’’  What  are
the specifics of this work and who is responsible?
• Lastly, EPA’s testimony describes the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Export for Re-
Use Notification Rule that went into affect in January of 2007 and states that
the ‘‘new requirements promise to ensure significantly better control over CRTs
exported  for  recycling.’’  How  much  funding  has  EPA  requested  for  the  over-
sight  and  enforcement  of  this  rule,  and  how  much  has  been  allocated,  for  FY
2007, FY 2008, and FY 2009 (requested)? How will this new rule ensure better
control  of  the  export  of  CRT  televisions  and  monitors?  Will  this  rule  be  ex-
panded  to  cover  other  electronic  devices,  like  computers,  cell  phones,  and  flat
panel displays?

A5. When  we  say  that  without  export  most  electronics  discarded  in  the  U.S.  would
be  disposed,  it  refers  to  the  limited  U.S.  markets  for  reuse  of  this  equipment,  as
well  as  for  use  of  recycled  raw  materials  in  manufacturing.  Thus,  without  inter-
national markets, many of the efforts currently underway in the U.S. to divert used
electronics  away  from  disposal  (land-filling  and/or  incineration)  and  toward  reuse
and recycling could not be sustained.

Our  study  on  electronics  management  in  the  U.S.  estimates  that  between  15–20
percent  of  used  electronics  collected  in  the  U.S.  are  reused  or  recycled—with  much
of this material exported as described below. The remaining 80–85, percent are dis-
posed  of  domestically.  We  estimate  that  most  of  the  disposal  is  in  landfills,  based
on  the  fact  that  the  vast  majority  of  waste  disposed  of  in  the  U.S.  is  managed  in
landfills,  as  opposed  to  incinerators  or  waste-to-energy  facilities  (80  percent  land-
filled,  versus  less  than  20  percent  in  incinerators  or  WM  facilities).5 We  hope  that
the amount of electronics destined for reuse and recycling will grow as a percentage,
but  this  will  necessarily  mean  that  more  electronics  will  be  destined  for  reuse  or
recycling abroad for the reasons discussed below.

The  worldwide  demand  for  used  electronic  equipment  and  components  is  both
very  high  and  extensive.  Many  used  electronic  components  are  marketed  globally,
with the highest demand in Asia, where these components are often used in the pro-
duction of refurbished or remanufactured electronics. Although there are some U.S.
markets  for  used  electronic  components  and  whole  equipment,  these  are  limited
compared  to  export  markets,  where  these  materials  generally  have  a  much  higher
value.  U.S.  consumers  also  are  much  less  likely  to  purchase  used  electronic  goods
than consumers in poorer countries.

Although hundreds of recyclers dismantle and process used electronics in the U.S.,
the primary markets for many of the derived materials are foreign ones. For exam-
ple, because there no U.S. smelters equipped to recover copper and precious metals
from circuit boards, all circuit boards must be exported. Likewise, all CRT glass fur-
naces  are  outside  the  U.S.,  primarily  in  Asia.  Thus,  most  CRT  glass  is  exported  to
glass  manufacturing  furnaces  in  Asia,  where  new  CRTs  are  made  using  recycled
glass. Virtually all plastics derived from processing used electronics in the U.S. are
exported to Asia.

In general, the recycling infrastructure in the U.S. is adequate for the preliminary
processing  of  electronics  (e.g.,  separating  out  parts  and  some  of  the  material
streams,  such  as  metals,  plastics  and  glass).  Numerous  recyclers  have  positioned
themselves  to  provide  even  greater  U.S.  processing  capacity  as  an  increasing  num-
ber of state recycling mandates take effect. However, many factors affect where proc-
essing,  and  recycling  will  ultimately  occur—that  is,  whether  certain  stages  of  proc-
essing  are  performed  in  the  U.S.  or  outside  the  U.S.  These  factors  include,  among
others, proximity to markets and manufacturing, labor rates and regulation.

With  regard  to  our  statement  that  ‘‘important  work  is  underway  to  ensure  that
these exports are managed appropriately at their destination,’’ we were referring to:
1)  developing  responsible  recycler  practices;  and  2)  actively  participating  in  inter-
national  dialogues  focused  on  developing  international  guidelines  for  the  sound
management  of  e-waste.  We  are  also  implementing  the  new  CRT  rule  which  is  in-
tended to provide better control over CRTs exported for reuse and recycling.6

For  implementation  of  the  CRT  rule,  EPA’s  Office  of  Solid  Waste  expended  0.4
FTE in FY 2007 and 0.3 FTE in FY 2008. We project a need of 0.3 FTE in FY 2009.
No  extramural  funds  were  used  by  OSW  during  this  time  period.  We  do  not  have
plans  to  expand  the  coverage  of  the  CRT  rule  to  the  export  of  other  forms  of  used
and  scrap  electronics.  EPA’s  Office  of  Enforcement  and  Compliance  Assistance  has
not  specifically  requested  any  funding  for  enforcement  of  the  CRT  rule  and  has  no
plans to do so for 2009. As with other rules, this office will devote resources as nec-
essary  to  address  identified  cases  of  noncompliance,  but  will  not  request  resources
specifically for that purpose.

To enable businesses and organizations to verify that electronic recyclers are em-
ploying  environmentally  responsible  practices,  we  are  working  with  stakeholders
(i.e., states, manufacturers, recyclers, trade associations and public interest groups)
to  develop  an  agreed  upon  set  of  practices  that  can  be  used  in  a  voluntary  certifi-
cation program to assure responsible environmental performance by electronic recy-
clers. Draft recycling guidelines have been reviewed by experienced facility auditors,
and field testing of these guidelines is now underway. The draft certification guide-
lines  place  a  great  deal  of  emphasis  on  ‘‘downstream  due  diligence’’  to  assure  that
e-waste is handled properly in the U.S., as well as outside the U.S., and specifically
address the need to ensure that exported equipment and materials comply with the
requirements of importing and transit countries.

Also,  as  we  mentioned  in  our  testimony,  we  have  led  the  development  of  inter-
national guidelines on the sound use and recycling of personal computers by the Or-
ganization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development  (OECD).  We  participated  in
a  Basel  Convention  partnership  effort  with  industry  that  is  developing  guidelines
for the safe reuse, recycling and trans-boundary movement of used and scrap mobile
phones.  We  are  also  involved  in  the  early  stages  of  a  similar  Basel  partnership  re-
garding  personal  computers.  Finally,  we  are  a  participant  in  a  working  group  of
international  stakeholders  of  academia,  trade  associations,  industry  and  govern-
ments—called  the  StEP  initiative—to  identify  voluntary  activities  that  promote
sound  reuse  and  safe  recycling,  especially  concerning  the  trans-boundary  flows  of
electronics.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. How  have  electronics  in  the  waste  stream  changed  over  the  past  decade  and
what predictions can we make about changes in the coming years? How do these
changes  affect  our  ability  to  safely  and  efficiently  recycle  or  reuse  these  devices?
A1. Over the past 10 years, both the quantity and composition of electronics in the
waste  stream  have  changed  dramatically.  From  1997  to  2007,  the  number  of  TVs,
computers,  keyboards,  hard  copy  devices,  and  cell  phones  that  Americans  generate
increased  by  220  percent,7 although  the  percentage  of  end-of-life  electronics  com-
pared to municipal solid waste is still relatively low—less than two percent.8 There
have  been  many  changes  in  the  types  of  products  entering  the  market  and  subse-
quently  the  waste  stream.  Portable  computers  now  comprise  over  a  quarter  of  the,
computers  generated  for  end-of-life  management,  whereas  a  decade  ago  they  were
only beginning to take a stronghold in the market.9 The number of cell phones that
were generated in 2007 increased by nearly 20 fold compared to 1997.7 Additionally,
cell phones have continued to become smaller and lighter. Flat screen monitors and

CRTs  for  reuse  to  keep,  for  not  less  than  three  years,  copies  of  business  records  demonstrating
that each shipment of exported CRTs will be reused. This requirement provides U.S. regulatory
authorities the opportunity to inspect these records in order to verify that the CRTs were actu-
ally sent to legitimate reuse or refurbishment entities. For export of CRTs and unprocessed CRT
glass  for  recycling  (as  opposed  to  reuse),  the  rule  requires  both  notification  to  EPA  of  the  in-
tended export and consent by the receiving country.

EPA stating that they plan to export CRTs for reuse. The rule also requires persons who export
CRTs  for  reuse  to  keep,  for  not  less  than  three  years,  copies  of  business  records  demonstrating
that each shipment of exported CRTs will be reused. This requirement provides U.S. regulatory
authorities the opportunity to inspect these records in order to verify that the CRTs were actu-
ally sent to legitimate reuse or refurbishment entities. For export of CRTs and unprocessed CRT
glass  for  recycling  (as  opposed  to  reuse),  the  rule  requires  both  notification  to  EPA  of  the  in-
tended export and consent by the receiving country.

TVs (featuring liquid crystal displays or plasma screens) are displacing cathode ray
tubes (CRTs).7 Sales of flat panel TVs outstripped CRTs in 2007.7

These  changes  in  the  composition  of  the  electronics  waste  stream  have  implica-
tions  for  recycling  markets.  For  example,  as  more  and  more  CRTs  are  returned  for
recycling, but, fewer CRTs are produced, new markets for leaded CRT glass will be
needed.  While  there  continue  to  be  markets  for  reusable/refurbishable  CRTs  and
CRT  glass  in  developing  countries  (where  CRT  glass  recycling  capability  is  avail-
able),  this  will  only  last  until  the  markets  in  those  locales  change  too.  Then,  alter-
native  uses  for  CRT  glass  will  be  necessary,  as  old  CRTs  will  still  be  disposed  of
even after new CRTs are no longer made.

Some  of  the  newer  products  entering  the  market  are  smaller  and  serve  multi-
functions. For example, the new cell phones are lighter and more compact than ear-
lier  models,  reducing  the  amount  of  packaging  and  the  number  of  trucks  needed  to
transport  the  finished  product.  On  the  other  hand,  some  new  products  are  signifi-
cantly larger, such as new TVs which are significantly larger than the TVs they are
replacing,  suggesting  that  there  will  be  more  material  to  manage  when  these  prod-
ucts reach the end of their useful life. There has been relatively little focus on how
to  recycle  these  new  products  (e.g.,  LCDs  and  plasma  screens),  suggesting  a  need
for more information on how to manage these products properly.

It  also  is  likely  that  rapid  innovation  and  product  convergence  will  continue.
Many  ‘‘stand-alone’’  products,  such  as  PDAs,  cell  phones,  MP3  players,  and  digital
cameras,  are  merging  into  single  multi-function  products,  in  some  cases  rendering
the  single  function  products  less  desirable,  although  there  still  seem  to  be  markets
for  stand-alone  products.  Many  products  will  be  capable  of  doing  more  in  smaller
sizes. As a result, they will be made of less material that needs recycling. Recyclers
will  be  faced  with  continually  changing  streams  of  materials  and  configurations  to
deal with.

Worldwide,  there  has  been  increasing  pressure  for  the  electronics  industry  to  ad-
here  to  stricter  materials  restrictions,  such  as  the  Reduction  of  Hazardous  Sub-
stances  (RoHS)  Directive  in  the  European  Union,  California’s  version  of  RoHS  and
EPEAT  (which  incorporates  the  RoHS  requirements  into  its  standards).  New  gen-
erations  of  electronics  (including  TVs,  computers  and  mobile  phones/PDAs)  are
being  designed  to  meet  these  requirements  through  use  of  fewer  toxic  inputs  and
greater  use  of  recyclable  materials.  These  requirements  will  reduce  certain  sub-
stances  of  concern  and  substitute  new  constituents  and  materials  not  used  before
in  electronics.  More  research  will  be  needed  on  new  constituents  and  additives  to
replace banned substances to make sure that the substitutes will both ensure prod-
uct performance integrity without introducing new environmental problems.

Demand  is  increasing  on  the  part  of  the  electronics  industry  for  more  secondary
materials  (e.g.,  plastics,  metals)  to  use  in  new  products.  However,  bans  on  certain
chemicals  and  constituents  in  electronics  are  making  it  harder  to  do  this.  This  is
because  many  materials  recovered  from  older  electronics  contain  banned  constitu-
ents (e.g., plastics impregnated with certain brominated flame retardants, lead). As
a result, new sources of secondary materials will be needed for the electronics indus-
try as well as ways to remove banned substances from the materials currently being
recovered from electronics so that they can be used in the manufacture of new elec-
tronics.

Finally, as electronic products continue to change and evolve, it will be necessary
to  support  continuing  research  on  how  to  make  recycling  of  these  products  more
cost-effective  and  safe.  Research  will  be  necessary  on  how  best  to  design  products
to  facilitate  dismantling,  how  to  identify  toxic  components  for  separation  and  safe
processing, as well as methods to minimize worker exposures during recycling.
Q2. Dr.  Williams  suggests  that  some  take-back  programs  have  an  adverse  effect  on
reuse.  Do  you  agree  with  this  assessment?  What  effect  does  EPA  see  on  reuse  of
commodities like cell phones due to the increase in take-back campaigns?

A2. Generally  speaking,  reuse  occurs  for  products  that  have  a  reuse  market.  The
strength  of  the  reuse  market  depends  on  a  number  of  factors,  such  as  the  quality
and age of the product in question and demand for the product. For example, there
is  a  strong  reuse  market  for  working  CRT  tubes  to  be  used  intact  in  new  TVs  or
computer  monitors  in  developing  country  markets,  where  consumers  cannot  afford
the  newer  flat  panel  screens.  EPA’s  Office  of  Solid  Waste  estimates  CRTs  that  can
be reused or refurbished are worth $4–$10 apiece. In addition, there is a strong de-
mand  for  working  CPUs  in  these  same  regions.  However,  as  prices  for  shipping  a
container  to  China  rise  dramatically  (up  from  $400  in  2004  to  $1,850  as  estimated
by American Retroworks, Inc.), exports of electronics need to be valuable enough to
cover  this  cost,  meaning  that  products  sent  abroad  are  more  likely  now  to  be  reus-
able  or  refurbishable  or  mined  for  working  parts.  This  means  that  most  recyclers

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:58 Aug 25, 2008 Jkt 041901 PO 00000 Frm 00126 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\043008\41901 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

123

(with the exception of recyclers that shred exclusively) have incorporated reuse into
their business model. There is a whole community of ‘‘refurbishers’’ whose business
model is based on reuse of the electronic equipment.

Another example is cell phones, which currently has a strong reuse market. While
some manufacturers of cell phones do not include reuse in their take-back programs
(due to competition from used equipment and concerns about the standards used for
‘‘refurbishing’’ phones affecting their reputation), most cell phone retailers, carriers,
and  private  recyclers,  as  well  as  charities,  schools  and  other  public  interest  organi-
zations have a strong reuse component in their take-back programs. This is because
there is still a greater economic return for resale of used phones than can be earned
from  recycling  them.  Even  companies  that  do  not  resell  or  refurbish  recovered
phones,  are  likely  to  break-down  the  phone  into  its  parts  and  recover  items,  such
as LCD screens, speakers, and other parts that are in good working order.

It  is  true  that  some  take-back  programs  have  had  the  effect  of  discouraging  or
preventing  reuse  of  some  kinds  of  products.  One  example  has  been  seen  in  Cali-
fornia,  not  because  the  State’s  law  explicitly  requires  recycling  over  reuse,  but  be-
cause California offers electronics recyclers a per-pound reimbursement for recycling
covered  electronics.  This  gives  recyclers  a  choice:  if  they  can  earn  more  by  selling
discarded  products  for  reuse,  they  will.  Conversely,  if  they  can  earn  more  by  recy-
cling  and  claiming  reimbursement  from  the  State,  they  will.  For  a  time,  the  recy-
cling value paid by the state exceeded the reuse value of certain products. California
recently reduced its reimbursement rate to processors who recycle, so sale for reuse
may become more attractive for some products. Some voluntary manufacturer take-
back  programs  for  IT  equipment  do  not  focus  on  reuse,  emphasizing  instead  parts
recovery or recycling over reuse or refurbishment of the product. At least one manu-
facturer,  Dell,  however,  has  incorporated  a  strong  reuse  component  into  all  of  its
voluntary take-back programs—both in their consumer take-back program and their
partnership with GoodWill. In Dell’s recycling programs, they have determined that
the amount of material that goes to reuse (both whole equipment and parts) versus
the  amount  of  material  that  goes  to  recycling  stays  constant,  indicating  that  reuse
is still a viable part of their program.
Q3. What  are  the  most  difficult  components  to  safely  and  cost-effectively  recycle?
Other witnesses have raised plastics, mercury lamps, and lead content as having
the  potential  to  negatively  affect  environmental  and  public  health.  What  is  the
state-of-the-art for recycling or reuse of these items?

A3. There are two different questions here: whether it is possible to cost-effectively
recycle electronics and whether it is possible to safely recycle electronics.

As  to  cost-effectiveness,  it  is  possible  to  recycle  many  computers  cost-effectively.
Many  used  IT  products  (especially  those  of  more  recent  vintage)  can  be  resold  as
is or refurbished, at a profit (e.g., CRTs, CPUs). For those that cannot, there is often
positive  value  in  these  products  in  the  way  of  parts  (e.g.,  circuit  boards  and  disk
drives)  and  recyclable  materials.  But  there  is  a  cost  to  collecting  and  transporting
these  products  to  recycling  facilities.  Sometimes  the  resale  value  of  the  products  or
the  value  of  the  materials  in  the  product  covers  the  collection  and  transportation
costs  (especially  in  the  case  of  smaller,  newer  products  such  as  laptops);  sometimes
it  does  not  (e.g.,  with  larger  or  older  products,  such  as  desktop  computers).  This  is
why  some  manufacturers  and  retailers  that  offer  take-back  programs  sometimes
charge a fee for some IT products.

TVs  are  just  the  opposite.  It  takes  more  labor  to  dismantle  TVs  than  is  earned
from the materials recovered. Because TVs are a net negative cost to recycle, many
collection programs (outside of those in states that mandate a point of purchase fee
or  manufacturer  responsibility  for  used  electronics)  charge  consumers  a  price  to
manage  discarded  TVs.  Also,  TVs  depreciate  as  they  age.  The  average  PC  monitor
brought  in  for  recycling  is  about  10–15  years  newer  than  the  average  TV  brought
in for recycling. However, the average age of TVs brought in for recycling is starting
to  decline  as  hotels  and  many  Americans  start  trading-up  to  flat  screen  models.  At
the  same  time,  the  average  weight  of  these  TVs  is  going  up  (reflecting  the  larger
TVs  purchased  over  the  years)  and  this  adds  to  the  cost  of  managing  them.  The
weight of TVs may drop again over time as thinner ‘‘flat’’ screens displace CRTs and
large projection TVs.

Regarding  safety  issues  in  recycling  electronics,  many  smaller  products,  such  as
cell  phones,  PDAs,  bluetooths  and  cameras,  contain  batteries  that  may  cause  prob-
lems in recycling unless they can be readily located and removed. Some digital cam-
eras contain mercury lamps that are time consuming to locate and remove. Failure
to  remove  these  items  can  contaminate  the  material  stream  if  these  products  are
crushed  or  shredded,  creating  the  risk  of  employee  or  environmental  exposure,  as
well as significantly reducing the re-sale value of the resulting materials.

Looking  forward,  several  factors  will  affect  how  safely  and  cost-effectively  elec-
tronics will be recycled. These factors include: 1) amount of electronics available for
recycling; 2) innovations in recycling technology; 3) the degree to which products are
designed to be more readily recyclable; and 4) the development of markets for mate-
rials  that  cannot  be  readily  used  in  the  making  of  new  electronics.  Due  to  State
take-back  requirements  and  the  expanding  use  of  voluntary  industry  take-back  op-
tions,  the  volume  of  electronic  material  for  recycling  has  increased.  As  the  volume
increases, economies of scale in collection, transportation and processing will reduce
costs. New technologies are being developed that will make it easier and more lucra-
tive to process older electronics moving through the system. New methods to quickly
and safely dismantle CRTs are now being demonstrated; technologies for improving
the recognition and segregation of the multiple plastics used in electronics are start-
ing  to  improve.  While  more  research  is  needed  to  perfect  these  new  technologies,
these  improvements  will  increase  the  speed  with  which  products  can  be  processed
and improve the end-markets for the materials recovered.

Also,  newer  electronics  are  increasingly  designed  for  recycling  as  a  result  of
EPEAT,  green  design  innovations  by  manufacturers,  and  EU  mandates.  For  exam-
ple,  manufacturers  are  looking  at  ways  to  identify  where  toxic  components  are  lo-
cated inside products and make it easier to remove them. They are also looking for
ways to mark various materials (e.g., plastics) so that they can be quickly identified
and separated in the recycling process, leading to more consistent and valuable ma-
terial  streams.  EPA  recently  approved  a  grant  for  the  Green  Electronics  Council  to
work  with  recyclers  to  recommend  design  changes  to  an  array  of  electronics  that
will facilitate faster and safer recycling.

New markets for certain materials recovered in the recycling process may be nec-
essary to help electronics recycling succeed economically. One example is CRT glass.
While  CRT  glass  can  be  used  in  lead  smelting  as  a  fluxing  agent  (and  there  is
worldwide  capacity  for  this  use),  there  are  also  markets  for  CRT  glass  in  Asia  to
make  new  CRTs.  As  CRTs  are  gradually  replaced  by  other  screen  technologies,
these  glass-to-glass  markets  will  decline  and  so  other  leaded  glass  markets  would
be  good  to  identify.  The  same  will  be  true  for  LCDs  and  plasma  screens  that  may
be supplanted by other technologies.

It  also  is  likely  that  many  newer  electronic  products  will  contain  less  of  the  high
value  metals  (precious  and  otherwise)  that  typified  the  earlier  generations  of  these
products. This will mean that the value to be recovered from these products will de-
cline, unless the value of materials in electronics increases. This is particularly true
of computers and TVs. Older computers, like those in the early ’90s, were larger and
with more copper wiring and steel casing (steel casing in the support banding of the
CRT  in  TVs  and  CPUs).  Now  CPU  casing  is  made  primarily  from  plastics.  Com-
puters and TV housings are now smaller, with less metal content and snore plastics.
Additionally, in some cases, copper wiring is being replaced by fiber optic.

How these two conflicting trends (lower cost of recycling vs. lower inherent value
in electronics for recovery), will affect the overall cost-effectiveness of electronics re-
cycling is hard to predict. However, as long as the costs of recycling continue to de-
cline  and  the  value  of  materials  and  the  ability  to  find  markets  for  materials  that
are  recovered  improves  (as  a  result  of  better  technologies  for  separation  (e.g.,  plas-
tics)  and  new  market  applications  for  materials  that  need  them  (e.g.,  CRT  glass),
the economic outlook for recycling of electronics should improve.

With respect to the state-of-the-art recycling methods for plastics, mercury lamps,

and lead, the following describes those methodologies that are currently used:

• Recycling  of  mercury-containing  devices,  such  as  mercury  lamps,  occurs  in  a
number of U.S. facilities. The process they follow includes recycling the glass
and  aluminum  end  caps,  and  recovering  the  mercury  through  retorting.  The
mercury is then used in the manufacture of new products.
• Lead  has  two  primary  uses  in  consumer  electronics:  (1)  it  is  used  in  CRTs
to prevent consumer exposure to harmful x-rays, and (2) its use in solder used
in electronic circuitry.

Æ State-of-the-art  reuse  and  recycling  of  CRTs  is  (1)  reuse  of  the  CRT  for
its  original  function—that  is  as  a  video  display  device,  (2)  recycling  of
scrap CRT glass for the purpose of producing new CRTs in a CRT manu-
facturing furnace (glass to glass furnace), and (3) placement of CRTs and
CRT glass in a lead smelter. In a lead smelter, not only is the lead recov-
ered  for  reuse,  but  the  glass  serves  as  a  flux  that  is  useful  to  the  smelt-
ing process.

Æ State-of-the-art for the recycling of circuit boards is placement in a smelt-
er to recover copper and precious metals. Depending upon the particular

125

smelter,  the  lead  may  also  be  recovered  or  it  will  remain  in  the  smelter
slag, which is land-filled.

• Plastics from electronics are also recovered and recycled, often involving hand
separation  of  plastic  types,  removal  of  contaminants,  pelletization  and  then
use in manufacturing new plastic products. Although a great deal of research
has  been  conducted  on  methods  for  mechanical  sorting  of  mixed  plastics,  it
is not clear that such methods have been perfected to the point of being viable
on a commercial scale.

Q4. There  have  been  claims  in  the  testimony  that  most  electronics  recycling  in  the
U.S.  is  collected  for  export  to  countries  with  less  stringent  environmental  safety
laws. Is there truth to this claim and if not where does the e-waste in other coun-
tries come from?

A4. As  discussed  above,  most  used  and  scrap  electronics  are  exported  for  reuse  or
recycling  abroad,  either  intact,  or  as  parts  or  as  pre-processed  materials  that  can
be used directly in the manufacture of new products. The U.S., like other developed
countries, operates in a global market where much of our electronic material is recy-
cled  in  other  countries  based  on  economic  drivers.  Thus,  Western  Europe,  Japan,
South  Korea,  Australia  and  Canada  all  have  exports  of  used  and  scrap  electronics
for reuse and recycling. These exports often go to the same locations as exports from
the U.S.

Used  electronics  are  exported  to  many  countries  for  the  purpose  of  recycling,  not
just developing countries with less stringent environmental laws. Currently, the pri-
mary destinations for these materials are Canada, Belgium, Sweden, Japan, Mexico
and  various  Asian  countries,  including  China,  India  and  Malaysia.  Electronic  cir-
cuitry  is  exported  to  smelters  in  Canada,  Belgium,  Sweden  and  Japan  for  copper
and  precious  metals  recovery.  Materials  for  copper  recovery  are  also  exported  to
China.  Plastics  are  largely  sent  to  Asian  recycling  facilities,  particularly  China.
Glass  from  cathode  ray  tubes  is  exported  to  Canada  for  lead  smelting,  Mexico  for
processing  prior  to  shipment  to  Asian  glass  furnaces,  and  CRT  glass  furnaces  in
India and Malaysia. Whole used electronics are also exported for dismantling or re-
furbishment  or  remanufacturing  in  Canada,  Mexico,  and  a  number  of  Asian  coun-
tries.  EPA  is  aware  that  not  all  of  these  exports  result  in  environmentally  sound
management.  Since  global  markets  are  essential  to  sustainable  and  sound  manage-
ment of e-waste, the key is to continue to work towards assuring that management
of  e-waste  is  protective  of  human  health  and  the  environment  wherever  it  takes
place. We are committed to continuing our ongoing efforts in this regard.
Q5. Does the EPA collect statistics on recycling by individual manufacturers? Do you
know  what  the  average  recycle  rate  of  manufacturers  is  in  the  U.S.  for  the  fol-
lowing  products:  CRT  monitors,  televisions,  computers,  car  batteries,  and  cell
phones?

A5. No,  we  do  not  have  information  to  determine  an  average  manufacturer  recy-
cling  rate,  but  we  do  have  information  on  the  national  recycling  rate  of  select  elec-
tronic  products.  In  the  U.S.,  computer  products  and  TVs  are  recycled  at  a  rate  of
approximately 18 percent. For cell phones, we have published a recycling rate of less
than 20 percent, but based on recent analyses believe it closer to 10 percent.10

Through the Plug-In To eCycling Program, which includes electronic manufactur-
ers  and  retailers,  partners  inform  EPA  of  their  recycling  activities.  Often  times  the
recycling  data  that  partners  provide  is  a  total  summation  of  their  voluntary  recy-
cling efforts and it is not broken down by product.

With  respect  to  car  batteries,  they  typically  are  managed  in  programs  separate
from those designed for collection of consumer electronics. In 2006, lead-acid car bat-
teries were recycled at a rate of 99 percent.11
Q6. How  many  products  require  refurbishment  before  they  can  be  reused?  Where
does refurbishment typically take place and are refurbished goods subject to, dif-
ferent trade standards?

A6. We  are  not  able  to  say  how  many  products  require  refurbishment  before  they
can be reused. However, products which typically undergo some degree of refurbish-
ment are those for which there is a reuse or resale market. This includes late model
computers,  laptops,  and  CRTs  (either  computer  or  TV  CRTs)  which  can  be  used  in

new computers and TVs (typically for sale in developing countries where the market
for newer monitor technologies is limited), and cell phones.

Refurbishment typically takes place at the recycler, with refurbishment of all elec-
tronic equipment being done both domestically and abroad. Refurbished or remanu-
factured  electronic  goods  are  not  subject  to  trade  standards  (i.e.,  refurbishing  proc-
ess standards).

They  are,  however,  subject  to  general  FTC  standards  which  require  them  to  be
labeled and marketed as refurbished/remanufactured to prevent deceptive practices.
Consequently,  electronic  recyclers  have  developed  their  own  individual  policies  for
(1)  what  used  equipment  can  be  refurbished  or  remanufactured;  and  (2)  to  what
level  they  will  be  refurbished  (sometimes  in  conjunction  with  manufacturers  and
carriers).

There  is  a  broad  spectrum  of  recycling  programs  established  across  the  United
States. Recycling programs may incorporate reuse and or refurbishment to different
levels. Specifically, recyclers may:

a viable resale market.

• Set  no  criteria,  other  than  reuse  or  refurbish  all  collected  material  that  has
• Set  minimum  criteria.  Criteria  may  be  set  with  regard  to  functionality,  cos-
metics or age of the equipment. Companies have also set criteria based on the
ability, or ease of clearing personal data. Any or all of these criteria could be
part of a recyclers refurbishing policy.
• Set very strict criteria. Some manufacturers and network carriers in both the
PC  and  cellular  industry  have  set  strict  standards  (called  factory  refurbish-
ment  standards)  for  what  is  required  for  use  in  warranty  exchange.  These
standards  address  both  the  cosmetic  and  the  functional  condition.  Industry
sources state that a large percentage of cell phones that are retired when con-
sumers  upgrade  to  new  devices  are  fully  functional  and  require  no  repair.
However, these phones would require cosmetic renewal to meet the strict war-
ranty exchange requirements.
• Engage  in  no  refurbishment  or  reuse  at  all.  Under  this  model,  all  material
goes  directly  to  material  recovery,  often  shredding.  Some  of  the  original  elec-
tronic manufacturers have programs in this category as they express concerns
with  competition  from  used  equipment  and  the  ‘‘standards’’  used  for  refur-
bishing phones affecting their reputation.
