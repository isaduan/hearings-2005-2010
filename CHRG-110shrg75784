OVERSIGHT  OF  TELEMARKETING  PRACTICES 
AND  THE  CREDIT  REPAIR  ORGANIZATIONS 
ACT  (CROA) 

TUESDAY,  JULY  31,  2007 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  2:35  p.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Mark  Pryor,  pre-
siding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 

Senator  PRYOR.  I’ll  go  ahead  and  call  the  meeting  to  order,  and 

I want to thank our witnesses for being here. 

We’re  going  to  have  some  other  Senators  join  us.  I  understand 
we’re  going  to  have  a  number  of  Senators  that  will  be  coming  and 
going  throughout  the  hearing,  and  I’d  like  to  thank  Chairman 
Inouye  and  Co-Chairman  Stevens  for  holding  this  hearing  and  al-
lowing me to chair this hearing on telemarketing practices and the 
Credit Repair Organizations Act, or CROA, under the FTC. 

I’d also like to thank them for their past leadership on this issue, 
in allowing these issues to come before the Committee on previous 
occasions. Both of these topics are very important to American con-
sumers and important in the American marketplace. 

I’m  a  sponsor  of  the  legislation  to  reauthorize  the  Do  Not  Call 
Registry,  I’m  particularly  interested  in  the  testimony  of  the  wit-
nesses  that  are  here  today  to  offer  insight  into  the  efficacy  of  the 
program  and  how  to  try  to  improve  that  program,  if  possible.  I’m 
also concerned about whether CROA is achieving the intended pro-
tections  Congress  created  in  1993,  and  whether  the  Act  is  pre-
venting consumer access to needed financial tools and resources. 

By analyzing the important issues of these laws and regulations, 
I’m optimistic that Congress can create legislation that is forward- 
thinking  to—and  considerate  of—the  interested  and  impacted  par-
ties.  I  believe  Congress  has  a  duty  to  protect  the  most  vulnerable 
Americans  from  scams  and  other  actions  of  unscrupulous  busi-
nesses,  and  I  hope  through  careful  consideration  of  the  testimony 
today,  and  emerging  issues,  we  can  protect  consumers  from  iden-
tity  theft,  and  undue  intrusion,  while  ensuring  the  stream  of  com-
merce as efficiently as possible.

So,  I’d  like  to  go  ahead  and  open  the  discussion,  we  may  have 
other  Senators  join  us  here  in  a  few  moments,  and  we  may  allow 
them to make opening statements when they come. 

But  first,  on  our  panel  today—I  guess  we’ll  do  5-minute  rounds? 
We’ll  allow  each  of  the  panelists  to  have  opening  statements  of  up 
to 5 minutes. We’ll do this in two panels. Then we’ll ask questions 
of  the  two  panels  separately.  We’ll  do  panel  one  first,  and  then 
we’ll do panel two and have questions after each panel. 

First,  let  me  introduce  Ms.  Lydia  Parnes;  she’s  the  Director  of 
Bureau  of  Consumer  Protection  at  the  Federal  Trade  Commission 
here in Washington, D.C. 

Ms. Parnes? 
STATEMENT OF LYDIA B. PARNES, DIRECTOR, BUREAU OF 
CONSUMER PROTECTION, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 
Ms. PARNES. Chairman Pryor, thank you. I appreciate the oppor-
tunity  to  appear  here  today  to  discuss  three  of  the  Commission’s 
important  consumer  protection  initiatives:  Our  longstanding  com-
mitment  to  fight  telemarketing  fraud,  the  FTC’s  widely  used  and 
highly  regarded  Do  Not  Call  Registry,  and  our  aggressive  enforce-
ment of the Credit Repair Organizations Act. 

As part of its mandate to protect consumers, the Commission de-
votes  significant  resources  to  combating  fraudulent,  deceptive  and 
abusive  telemarketing  practices.  We  do  this  by  enforcing  Section  5 
of  the  FTC  Act,  and  the  Commission’s  Telemarketing  Sales  Rule, 
both  of  which  prohibit  false  and  misleading  claims,  unauthorized 
billing, and other practices used by fraudsters to steal money from 
consumers. 

The  Commission  also  implements  and  enforces  the  Do  Not  Call 
Registry,  which  protects  the  privacy  of  Americans  who  have  ex-
pressed their wish not to receive telemarketing calls. 

The Commission has been pursuing fraudulent telemarketers for 
more than 20 years. Since 1991, we have filed more than 350 tele-
marketing cases, challenging an array of scams, including bogus in-
vestment  schemes,  business  opportunities,  and  sweepstakes 
pitches. 

In  addition  to  the  strong  injunctive  relief  we  obtained  in  these 
cases,  the  Commission  has  secured  orders  providing  for  more  than 
$500 million in consumer redress, or disgorgement. 

We share your concern about telemarketers targeting the elderly. 
The  May  20  New  York  Times  article  on  this  issue,  highlighted  the 
role  that  third  parties  play  in  facilitating  telemarketing  fraud. 
Fraudulent telemarketers have always required the participation of 
third-party  businesses.  Lead  list  generators  and  brokers,  third- 
party  telemarketing  firms,  fulfillment  houses,  money  transmitters, 
payment processors, banks and telephone companies are just some 
of  the  entities  that  telemarketers  need  to  run  their  business.  That 
is  why  Congress,  in  the  Telemarketing  Act,  gave  the  Commission 
the authority to regulate and challenge practices that assist and fa-
cilitate  fraudulent  telemarketing,  and  the  Commission  has  used 
that authority. 

In  addition  to  its  anti-fraud  work  in  the  telemarketing  area,  the 
Commission  administers  the  National  Do  Not  Call  Registry.  Since 
its  implementation  in  June  2003,  consumers  have  registered  more

3 

than  146  million  telephone  numbers.  The  humorist,  Dave  Barry, 
called  it  ‘‘the  most  popular  Government  program  since  the  Elvis 
stamp.’’ 

According  to  a  Harris  Interactive  Survey  released  last  year,  92 
percent of those polled reported receiving fewer telemarketing calls. 
The success of the Registry is due, in part, to vigorous enforcement, 
and  a  high  rate  of  industry  compliance.  The  Commission  has 
brought  27  cases  to  enforce  the  Do  Not  Call  rule,  resulting  in  or-
ders for $17.4 million in civil penalties and disgorgement. 

Reauthorizing  the  Do  Not  Call  Implementation  Act,  and  with  it, 
our  ability  to  collect  fees  from  those  who  access  the  Registry,  will 
ensure  the  continued  success  of  the  Do  Not  Call  Program,  and  un-
derscore  our  collective  commitment  to  this  important  privacy  pro-
tection. 

We  do  believe  the  bill  can  be  strengthened,  by  statutorily  man-
dating the fees charged to telemarketers accessing the registry, and 
look forward to working with you on this matter. 

The  Commission  also  enforces  the  Credit  Repair  Organizations 
Act  by  aggressively  pursuing  businesses  engaged  in  fraudulent 
credit  repair.  CROA  was  enacted  to  protect  the  public  from  unfair 
and deceptive practices by credit repair organizations. 

Together  with  its  Federal  and  State  law  enforcement  partners, 
the  Commission  has  conducted  several  law  enforcement  sweeps 
against  fraudulent  credit  repair  outfits,  resulting  in  over  100  en-
forcement  actions.  We’ve  also  engaged  in  outreach  to  businesses 
and  consumers,  and  have  published  numerous  educational  mate-
rials  designed  to  educate  both  consumers  and  businesses  about 
their respective rights and obligations in the credit area. 

The  Commission  will  continue  to  take  aggressive  action  to  en-
force  CROA,  combat  fraudulent,  deceptive  and  abusive  tele-
marketing practices, and to continue the success of the Do Not Call 
Registry. 

Again,  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  the  Com-
mittee, and would be pleased to take any questions you may have. 

[The prepared statement of Ms. Parnes follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF LYDIA B. PARNES, DIRECTOR, BUREAU OF CONSUMER 

PROTECTION, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 

Chairman  Inouye,  Ranking  Member  Stevens,  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I 
am  Lydia  Parnes,  Director  of  the  Bureau  of  Consumer  Protection  at  the  Federal 
Trade Commission (‘‘Commission’’ or ‘‘FTC’’).1 I appreciate the opportunity to appear 
before  you  today  to  tell  you  about  the  Commission’s  law  enforcement  program 2 to 
fight  telemarketing  fraud  and  protect  consumers’  privacy  from  unwanted  tele-
marketing  calls,  as  well  as  our  enforcement  of  the  Credit  Repair  Organizations  Act 
(‘‘CROA’’). 
I. Anti-fraud and Privacy Initiatives Under the Telemarketing Sales Rule 

An article in the May 20 issue of The New York Times,3 which included some dis-
turbing  allegations  about  telemarketing  fraud  targeting  the  elderly,  has  prompted 
a number of inquiries from Members of Congress. This article focused on the alleged 
practices  of  infoUSA,  a  leading  purveyor  of  compiled  consumer  data.  According  to 
the  article,  the  company  marketed  lists  of  elderly  consumers  and  failed  to  imple-
ment  safeguards  to  ensure  that  only  legitimate  companies  could  purchase  its  data. 
Deplorable  actions  like  the  ones  described  in  this  article  are  among  the  types  of 
fraudulent  practices  targeted  by  the  Commission’s  telemarketing  law  enforcement 
program.  The  Commission  has  an  extensive  program  to  battle  fraudulent  and  abu-
sive  telemarketing  practices  through  its  vigorous  enforcement  of  the  Telemarketing 
Sales  Rule  (‘‘TSR’’).  The  FTC’s  telemarketing  enforcement  has  two  components.

4 

First, the Commission focuses strongly on the anti-fraud provisions of the TSR. Sec-
ond,  the  FTC  implements  and  enforces  the  requirements  of  the  National  Do  Not 
Call  Registry,  which  protects  the  privacy  of  Americans  who  have  expressed  their 
wish  not  to  receive  telemarketing  calls  by  entering  their  numbers  in  the  Registry. 
A.  The  Commission’s  Enforcement  of  the  Telemarketing  Sales  Rule’s  Anti-Fraud 

Provisions 

The  Commission  has  a  strong  commitment  to  rooting  out  telemarketing  fraud. 
From 1991 to the present, the FTC has brought more than 350 telemarketing cases. 
The  vast  majority  of  these  cases  involved  fraudulent  marketing  of  investment 
schemes, business opportunities, sweepstakes pitches, and the sales of various goods 
and services, including health care products. Prior to 1994, these cases were brought 
pursuant  to  Section  5  of  the  FTC  Act,  which  prohibits  ‘‘unfair  or  deceptive  acts  or 
practices in or affecting commerce.’’ 4 

In  1994,  Congress  enhanced  the  Commission’s  enforcement  arsenal  by  enacting 
the  Telemarketing  and  Consumer  Fraud  and  Abuse  Prevention  Act  (the  ‘‘Tele-
marketing  Act’’).5 This  legislation  directed  the  Commission  to  issue  a  trade  regula-
tion  rule  defining  and  prohibiting  deceptive  or  abusive  telemarketing  acts  or  prac-
tices.  The  Commission  promulgated  the  TSR  in  1995.  Since  1996,  the  Commission 
has  filed  more  than  240  cases  under  the  TSR.  In  most  of  these  cases,  the  Commis-
sion sought preliminary relief to bring an immediate halt to ongoing law violations, 
and in virtually every case ultimately obtained permanent injunctions to prevent fu-
ture misconduct. In addition to injunctive relief, the Commission has secured orders 
providing  for  more  than  $500  million  in  consumer  restitution  or,  where  restitution 
was  not  practicable,  disgorgement  to  the  U.S.  Treasury.  During  this  same  period, 
the Commission, through cases filed on its behalf by the U.S. Department of Justice 
(‘‘DOJ’’),6 has obtained civil penalty orders totaling nearly $17 million. 

As  an  example,  just  last  week  the  FTC  halted  the  allegedly  unlawful  tele-
marketing  operations  of  Suntasia  Marketing,7 which,  according  to  the  FTC’s  com-
plaint,  took  millions  of  dollars  directly  out  of  tens  of  thousands  of  consumers’  bank 
accounts  without  their  knowledge  or  authorization.  Suntasia  allegedly  tricked  con-
sumers  into  divulging  their  bank  account  numbers  by  pretending  to  be  affiliated 
with  the  consumers’  banks  and  offering  a  purportedly  ‘‘free  gift’’  to  consumers  who 
accepted a ‘‘free trial’’ of Suntasia’s products. Once the consumer divulged his or her 
bank account number, Suntasia allegedly was able to debit each consumer’s account 
for initial fees ranging from $40 to $149. Often, charges between $19.95 and $49.95 
recurred on a monthly basis, and Suntasia allegedly frustrated consumers’ attempts 
to  stop  them.  According  to  the  complaint,  some  of  Suntasia’s  calls  were  directed  to 
consumers  listed  in  ‘‘full-data  leads,’’  which  already  included  consumers’  bank  ac-
count  numbers.  Practical  Marketing,  a  company  from  whom  Suntasia  purchased 
such  leads,  was  investigated  and  prosecuted  by  the  U.S.  Postal  Inspection  Service 
and  the  U.S.  Attorney  for  the  Southern  District  of  Illinois,  and  pled  guilty  to  one 
count of identity theft on November 6, 2006.8 

Working  in  cooperation  with  the  U.S.  Postal  Inspection  Service  and  state  and 
local law enforcement, the Commission moved aggressively to stop Suntasia’s alleg-
edly unlawful practices. Last week, the Commission sought and obtained an ex parte 
court order. At the Commission’s request, the U.S. District Court for the Middle Dis-
trict  of  Florida  halted  the  scheme,  appointed  a  receiver,  and  froze  the  assets  of  the 
nine corporate defendants and six individual defendants. The defendants’ assets are 
frozen to preserve the agency’s ability to obtain funds for injured consumers, should 
the  Commission  prevail  in  this  litigation.  The  Suntasia  case  is  just  one  example  of 
the  FTC’s  vigorous  law  enforcement  program—a  key  feature  of  which  is  partnering 
with  other  law  enforcement  agencies  whenever  possible—to  protect  American  con-
sumers from the pernicious practices of fraudulent telemarketers. 

By no means does the Suntasia case stand alone. The FTC frequently works with 
various  Federal,  state,  local,  and  foreign  partners  to  conduct  law  enforcement 
‘‘sweeps’’—multiple  simultaneous  law  enforcement  actions—that  focus  on  specific 
types of telemarketing fraud,9 and works to promote joint filing of telemarketing ac-
tions  with  the  states.10 When  the  Commission  files  a  lawsuit  in  Federal  district 
court, we seek every appropriate equitable civil remedy a court can grant it to stop 
telemarketing fraud.11 Remedies may include freezing the defendants’ personal and 
corporate  assets,  appointing  receivers  over  the  corporate  defendants,  issuing  tem-
porary  and  permanent 
injunctions,  and  ordering  consumer  redress  and 
disgorgement of ill-gotten gains. 

A sample of the FTC’s recent cases illustrates the range of the FTC’s enforcement 
program.  For  instance,  one  case  resulted  in  a  judgment  of  more  than  $8  million 
against  Canadian  telemarketers  of  advance-fee  credit  cards.12 Another  yielded  a 
contempt  order  banning  a  seller  of  bogus  business  opportunities  from  all  tele-

5 

marketing.13 Still  another  case  resulted  in  a  permanent  injunction  against  a  Can-
ada-based operation that allegedly telemarketed fraudulent ‘‘credit card loss protec-
tion’’  and  bogus  discount  medical  and  prescription  drug  packages.14 In  one  of  the 
Commission’s  largest  actions,  which  involved  an  international  ring  that  allegedly 
sold  advance-fee  credit  cards,  the  agency  obtained  an  order  banning  13  individuals 
and entities from telemarketing.15 

Although  the  Commission  does  not  have  criminal  law  enforcement  authority,  it 
recognizes  the  importance  of  criminal  prosecution  to  deterrence  and  consumer  con-
fidence. Accordingly, the Commission routinely refers matters appropriate for crimi-
nal  prosecution  to  Federal  and  state  prosecutors  through  its  Criminal  Liaison  Unit 
(‘‘CLU’’).  Since  October  1,  2002,  214  people  have  been  indicted 16 in  criminal  cases 
involving  telemarketing  fraud  that  arose  from  referrals  made  by  CLU,  including 
cases  where  an  FTC  attorney  was  designated  a  Special  Assistant  U.S.  Attorney  to 
help  with  the  criminal  prosecution.  Of  those  214  charged,  111  were  convicted  or 
pleaded  guilty.  The  rest  are  awaiting  trial,  in  the  process  of  extradition  from  a  for-
eign county, or fugitives from justice.17 

As  in  the  Suntasia  case,  the  Commission  targets  telemarketers  who  obtain  con-
sumers’ personal information under false pretenses. For example, in Xtel Marketing, 
the  FTC  sued  telemarketers  that  masqueraded  as  Social  Security  Administration 
representatives  and  claimed  that  call  recipients  risked  losing  their  Social  Security 
payments if they did not provide their bank account information.18 Just last month, 
based  on  information  provided  by  the  FTC,  a  Federal  judge  sentenced  one  of  the 
principals in this scheme to 5 years in prison. 

Telemarketers’  deceptive  and  abusive  practices  often  are  aided  or  made  possible 
by third parties, such as list brokers, who sell personal information about consumers 
to  disreputable  telemarketers,  or  by  unscrupulous  payment  processors  that  enable 
fraudulent telemarketers to reach into consumers’ bank accounts. 

The  May  20  New  York  Times  article  highlighted  the  role  list  brokers  can  play  in 
facilitating  such  fraud.  The  article  described  the  alleged  practices  of  infoUSA,  lead-
ing purveyor of compiled consumer data. According to the article, the company mar-
keted  lists  of  information  about  elderly  consumers  and  failed  to  implement  safe-
guards  to  ensure  that  only  legitimate  companies  could  purchase  its  data.  The  FTC 
has brought a number of cases challenging the sale of such lists to fraudulent tele-
marketers. In 2002, the FTC sued three information brokers that allegedly knew or 
consciously  avoided  knowing  that  they  supplied  lists  of  consumers  to  telemarketers 
acting  in  violation  of  the  TSR.  The  FTC  charged  that  Listdata  Computer  Services, 
Inc.,  Guidestar  Direct  Corporation,  and  NeWorld  Marketing  LLC  knowingly  sup-
plied  lists  to  telemarketers  that  were  engaging  in  per  se  violations  of  the  TSR  by 
engaging  in  advance-fee  loan  scams.19 Misuse  of  lists  is  a  practice  specifically  ad-
dressed  in  the  permanent  injunctions  the  FTC  seeks  in  its  enforcement  actions 
against fraudulent telemarketers. A standard provision of the FTC’s proposed orders 
bans  or  severely  restricts  telemarketing  defendants  from  selling,  renting,  leasing, 
transferring, or otherwise disclosing their customer lists. The FTC continues to mon-
itor  the  practices  of  list  brokers  in  this  area  through  ongoing,  non-public  investiga-
tions.20 

The FTC also has challenged other third-party actors such as payment processors, 
without  whose  assistance  telemarketers  would  not  be  able  to  gain  access  to  con-
sumers’  bank  accounts.21 Generally,  the  FTC  has  alleged  that  these  payment  proc-
essors  knew  or  consciously  avoided  knowing  that  they  were  facilitating  fraudulent 
telemarketing operations in violation of the TSR 22 and, where appropriate, also has 
alleged  direct  violations  of  Section  5  of  the  FTC  Act.  Two  cases  brought  this  past 
December  illustrate  Commission  enforcement  in  this  area.  In  the  first  case,  FTC  v. 
Interbill,23 the  FTC  alleged  that  Interbill  debited  money  from  consumer  accounts 
without  their  authorization,  in  violation  of  the  FTC  Act.24 In  the  second,  FTC  v. 
Global  Marketing  Group,  Inc.,25 the  FTC  obtained  a  preliminary  injunction  to  shut 
down a payment processor that allegedly provided services to at least nine advance- 
fee loan telemarketers.26 

The  Commission’s  consumer  and  business  education  efforts  complement  our  law 
enforcement initiatives. The FTC not only publishes compliance guides for business, 
but  also  a  wealth  of  information  in  English  and  Spanish  for  consumers,  including 
brochures  and  fact  sheets  on  telemarketing  fraud,  sweepstakes  and  lotteries,  work- 
at-home  schemes,  and  advance-fee  loans,  as  well  as  phishing  and  other  Internet- 
based  frauds.  This  information  is  available  in  print  and  online.  The  FTC  and  its 
partners also distribute consumer education information to seniors groups and other 
community  organizations.27 In  addition  to  providing  educational  resources  to  con-
sumers  and  organizations  nationwide,  the  FTC  partners  with  other  organizations 
and people who regularly meet with seniors and send representatives to community 
events.

B. Enforcement of the Do Not Call Provisions of the TSR 

6 

In  addition  to  its  anti-fraud  work  in  the  telemarketing  arena,  the  Commission 
amended the TSR in 2003 to strengthen its privacy protection provisions by, among 
other things, establishing the National Do Not Call Registry.28 Consumers have reg-
istered  more  than  146  million  telephone  numbers  since  the  Registry  became  oper-
ational in June 2003, and the Do Not Call program has been tremendously success-
ful  in  protecting  consumers’  privacy  from  unwanted  telemarketing  calls.  A  Harris 
Interactive® Survey  released  in  January  2006  showed  that  94  percent  of  American 
adults  have  heard  of  the  Registry  and  76  percent  have  signed  up  for  it.29 Ninety- 
two percent of those polled reported receiving fewer telemarketing calls.30 Similarly, 
an  independent  survey  by  the  Customer  Care  Alliance  demonstrates  that  the  Na-
tional  Registry  has  been  an  effective  means  for  consumers  to  limit  unwanted  tele-
marketing calls.31 

While the Commission appreciates the high rate of compliance with the TSR’s Do 
Not Call provisions, it vigorously enforces compliance to ensure the program’s ongo-
ing  effectiveness.  Violating  the  Do  Not  Call  requirements  subjects  telemarketers  to 
civil  penalties  of  up  to  $11,000  per  violation.32 Twenty-seven  of  the  Commission’s 
telemarketing  cases  have  alleged  Do  Not  Call  violations,  resulting  in  $8.8  million 
in civil penalties and $8.6 million in redress or disgorgement ordered.33 

A  recent  case  against  The  Broadcast  Team,  filed  by  DOJ  on  behalf  of  the  FTC, 
illustrates  the  enforcement  of  the  TSR’s  Do  Not  Call  provisions.34 The  Broadcast 
Team  allegedly  used  ‘‘voice  broadcasting’’  to  make  tens  of  millions  of  illegal  auto-
mated  telemarketing  calls,  often  to  numbers  on  the  National  Do  Not  Call  Registry. 
The  complaint  alleged  that  the  company  used  an  automated  phone  dialing  service 
to call and deliver pre-recorded telemarketing messages. When a live person picked 
up  the  phone,  The  Broadcast  Team  allegedly  hung  up  immediately  or,  in  other  in-
stances,  played  a  recording.  Either  course  of  conduct  violates  the  TSR’s  restriction 
on  ‘‘abandoning  calls’’—that  is,  failing  to  connect  a  consumer  to  a  live  sales  rep-
resentative  within  2  seconds  after  the  consumer  answers  the  telephone.35 The 
Broadcast Team agreed to pay a $1 million civil penalty to settle the charges.36 

The largest Do Not Call case to date involved satellite television subscription sell-
er DIRECTV and a number of companies that telemarketed on behalf of DIRECTV. 
DIRECTV  paid  over  $5.3  million  to  settle  Do  Not  Call  and  call  abandonment 
charges,37 one of the largest civil penalties the Commission has obtained in any case 
enforcing a consumer protection law. 
II. Re-Authorization of the Do Not Call Implementation Act 

The  Do  Not  Call  Implementation  Act  (‘‘DNCIA’’),  passed  by  Congress  on  March 
11,  2003,  authorized  the  FTC  to  promulgate  regulations  establishing  fees  sufficient 
to  implement  and  enforce  the  Do  Not  Call  provisions  of  the  TSR.  This  section  first 
describes  generally  how  the  Do  Not  Call  program  works  for  consumers,  tele-
marketers,  and  law  enforcement  agencies.  It  then  discusses  the  grant  of  authority 
in the DNCIA for the Commission to charge fees for access to the National Registry, 
and  the  Commission’s  use  of  such  fees  to  maintain  the  effectiveness  of  the  TSR’s 
Do Not Call provisions. Finally, it addresses legislative improvements to the DNCIA 
that  would  ensure  the  continued  success  of  the  National  Registry  and  strengthen 
the Commission’s telemarketing enforcement operations. 
A. How the National Do Not Call Registry Works 

The National Registry is a comprehensive, automated system used by consumers, 
telemarketers,  and  law  enforcement  agencies.  The  Registry  was  built  to  accomplish 
four primary tasks: 

1. To allow consumers to register their preferences not to receive telemarketing 
calls at registered telephone numbers; 
2. To allow telemarketers and sellers to access the telephone numbers included 
in the National Registry and to pay the appropriate fees for such access; 
3.  To  gather  consumer  complaint  information  concerning  alleged  Do  Not  Call 
violations automatically over the telephone and the Internet; and 
4. To allow FTC, state, and other law enforcement personnel access to consumer 
registration  information,  telemarketer  access  information,  and  complaint  infor-
mation maintained in the Registry. 

Consumers can register their telephone numbers through two methods: by calling 
a  toll-free  number  from  the  telephone  number  they  wish  to  register,  or  over  the 
Internet.  The  process  is  fully  automated,  takes  only  a  few  minutes,  and  requires 
consumers to provide minimal personally identifying information.38

7 

Telemarketers  and  sellers  can  access  registered  telephone  numbers,  and  pay  the 
appropriate fee for that access, if any, through an Internet website dedicated to that 
purpose. The only information about consumers that companies receive from the Na-
tional  Registry  is  the  registered  telephone  number  with  no  name  attached.  Those 
numbers  are  sorted  and  available  for  download  by  area  code.  Companies  may  also 
check a small number of telephone numbers at a time via interactive Internet pages. 
Consumers who receive unwanted telemarketing calls can register a complaint via 
either  a  toll-free  telephone  number,  an  interactive  voice  response  system,  or  the 
Internet.  To  conduct  investigations,  law  enforcement  officials  also  can  access  data 
in the National Registry, including consumer registration information, telemarketer 
access information, and consumer complaints. Such access is provided to the law en-
forcement community throughout the United States, Canada, and Australia through 
Consumer Sentinel, a secure Internet website maintained by the FTC. 
B. Fees Collected and Used Pursuant to the DNCIA 

The  DNCIA  gave  the  Commission  the  specific  authority  to  ‘‘promulgate  regula-
tions  establishing  fees  sufficient  to  implement  and  enforce  the  provisions  relating 
to the ‘Do-Not-Call’ Registry of the Telemarketing Sales Rule (‘‘TSR’’).’’ 39 It also pro-
vided that ‘‘[n]o amounts shall be collected as fees pursuant to this section for such 
fiscal  years  except  to  the  extent  provided  in  advance  in  appropriations  Acts.  Such 
amounts  shall  be  available  . . .  to  offset  the  costs  of  activities  and  services  related 
to  the  implementation  and  enforcement  of  the  [TSR],  and  other  activities  resulting 
from such implementation and enforcement.’’ 40 Pursuant to the DNCIA and the ap-
propriations Acts, the Commission has conducted annual rulemaking proceedings to 
establish the appropriate level of fees to charge telemarketers for access to the Reg-
istry. 

The  fees  collected  are  intended  to  offset  costs  in  three  areas.  First,  funds  are  re-
quired to operate the Registry. As described above, the development and ongoing op-
eration of the Do Not Call Registry involves significant resources and effort. 

Second,  funds  are  required  for  law  enforcement  and  deterrence  efforts,  including 
identifying  targets,  coordinating  domestic  and  international  initiatives,  challenging 
alleged  violators,  and  engaging  in  consumer  and  business  education  efforts,  which 
are  critical  to  securing  compliance  with  the  TSR.  As  with  all  TSR  enforcement,  the 
agency  coordinates  with  its  state  partners  and  DOJ,  thereby  leveraging  resources 
and maximizing deterrence. Further, given the fact that various telemarketing oper-
ations are moving offshore, international coordination is especially important. These 
law  enforcement  efforts  are  a  significant  component  of  the  total  costs,  given  the 
large  number  of  investigations  conducted  by  the  agency  and  the  substantial  effort 
necessary to complete such investigations. 

As  noted  previously,  the  Commission  considers  consumer  and  business  education 
efforts important complements to enforcement in securing compliance with the TSR. 
Because  the  amendments  to  the  TSR  were  substantial,  and  the  National  Registry 
was  an  entirely  new  feature,  educating  consumers  and  businesses  helped  to  reduce 
confusion,  enhance  consumers’  privacy,  and  ensure  the  overall  effectiveness  of  the 
system. Based on the Commission’s experience, this substantial outreach effort was 
necessary, constructive, and effective in ensuring the success of the program. 

Third, funds are required to cover ongoing agency infrastructure and administra-
tion  costs  associated  with  operating  and  enforcing  the  Registry,  including  informa-
tion  technology  structural  supports  and  distributed  mission  overhead  support  costs 
for staff and non-personnel expenses, such as office space, utilities, and supplies. In 
this  regard,  the  FTC  has  made  substantial  investments  in  technology  and  infra-
structure  in  response  to  the  significantly  increased  capacity  required  by  the  Na-
tional Registry. 

Under  the  current  fee  structure,  telemarketers  are  charged  $62  per  area  code  of 
data,  starting  with  the  sixth  area  code,  up  to  a  maximum  of  $17,050  for  the  entire 
Registry.41 Telemarketers  are  prohibited  from  entering  into  fee-sharing  arrange-
ments,  including  any  arrangement  with  any  telemarketer  or  service  provider  to  di-
vide the fees amongst its various clients. 

Telemarketers receive the first five area codes of data at no cost. The Commission 
allows such free access to limit the burden placed on small businesses that only re-
quire  access  to  a  small  portion  of  the  Registry.  The  National  Registry  also  allows 
organizations  exempt  from  the  Registry  requirements  to  access  the  Registry  at  no 
cost.42 While  these  entities  are  not  required  by  law  to  access  the  Registry,  many 
do so voluntarily in order to avoid calling consumers who have expressed their pref-
erences  not  to  receive  telemarketing  calls.  The  Commission  determined  that  such 
entities  should  not  be  charged  access  fees  when  they  are  under  no  legal  obligation 
to comply with the Do Not Call requirements of the TSR because it may make them

8 

less likely to obtain access to the Registry, which would result in an increase in the 
number of unwanted calls to consumers. 
C. Legislative Modifications of the DNCIA 

As noted above, the DNCIA allowed the FTC to promulgate regulations to collect 
fees  for  the  Do  Not  Call  Registry.  The  Commission  believes  that  reauthorizing  the 
DNCIA  will  demonstrate  Congress’  continued  commitment  to  protecting  consumers 
from  unwanted  intrusions  into  the  privacy  of  their  homes,  and  appreciates  Senator 
Pryor’s  proposed  reauthorizing  legislation.  The  Commission  believes  that  the  bill 
can  be  strengthened  by  statutorily  mandating  the  fees  to  be  charged  to  tele-
marketers accessing the National Registry, and specifically by mandating such fees 
in an amount sufficient to enable the Commission to enforce the TSR. The Commis-
sion  believes  that  such  an  amendment  to  the  DNCIA  would  ensure  the  continued 
success of the National Registry by providing the Commission with a stable funding 
source for its TSR enforcement activities. The Commission also believes a stable fee 
structure would benefit telemarketers, sellers, and service providers who access the 
Registry. The Commission looks forward to working with you on this matter. 
III. Credit Repair Organizations Act 

The  Commission  also  enforces  the  Credit  Repair  Organizations  Act  (‘‘CROA’’  ) 43 
by  aggressively  pursuing  businesses  engaging  in  fraudulent  ‘‘credit  repair.’’  CROA 
was enacted to protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising and business 
practices  by  credit  repair  organizations.  In  addition  to  prohibiting  false  or  mis-
leading statements about credit repair services,44 CROA includes a number of other 
important requirements to protect consumers, including a ban on collecting payment 
before  the  service  is  fully  performed  and  a  requirement  to  provide  consumers  with 
a written disclosure statement before any agreement is executed.45 

The  Commission  has  conducted  several  sweeps  of  fraudulent  credit  repair  oper-
ations, including Project Credit Despair (twenty enforcement actions brought by the 
FTC,  U.S.  Postal  Inspection  Service,  and  eight  state  attorneys  general  in  2006); 46 
Operation  New  ID—Bad  Idea  I  and  II  (52  actions  brought  by  the  FTC  and  other 
law  enforcement  agencies  in  1999); 47 and  Operation  Eraser  (32  actions  brought  by 
the FTC, state attorneys general, and DOJ in 1998).48 

The  Commission  also  educates  businesses  and  consumers  about  credit  repair. 
Among  other  outreach  efforts,  the  Commission  publishes  a  large  volume  of  edu-
cational  materials  designed  to  educate  both  consumers  and  businesses  about  their 
respective  rights  and  obligations  in  the  credit  area.  The  agency’s  publications  in-
clude:  Credit  Repair:  Self  Help  May  Be  Best,49 which  explains  how  consumers  can 
improve their creditworthiness and lists legitimate resources for low or no cost help; 
and How to Dispute Credit Report Errors,50 which explains how to dispute and cor-
rect inaccurate information on a consumer report and includes a sample dispute let-
ter. 

One  issue  that  has  arisen  recently  is  whether  CROA  should  be  amended  to  ex-
empt  credit  monitoring  services,  which  are  offered  by  consumer  reporting  agencies, 
banks, and others.51 As a matter of policy, the Commission sees little basis on which 
to  subject  the  sale  of  legitimate  credit  monitoring  and  similar  educational  products 
and services to CROA’s specific prohibitions and requirements, which were intended 
to address deceptive and abusive credit repair business practices. Credit monitoring 
services,  if  promoted  and  sold  in  a  truthful  manner,  can  help  consumers  maintain 
an  accurate  credit  file  and  provide  them  with  valuable  information  for  combating 
identity theft.52 However, any amendment intended to provide an exemption for le-
gitimate  credit  monitoring  services  must  be  carefully  considered  and  narrowly 
drawn.  Drafting  an  appropriate  legislative  clarification  is  difficult  and  poses  chal-
lenges for effective law enforcement. If an exemption is drafted too broadly, it could 
provide  an  avenue  for  credit  repair  firms  to  evade  CROA.  Indeed,  in  enforcing 
CROA, the Commission has encountered many allegedly fraudulent credit repair op-
erations that aggressively find and exploit existing exemptions in an attempt to es-
cape  the  strictures  of  the  current  statute.53 Because  of  the  drafting  difficulties,  the 
Commission  urges  Congress  to  continue  to  reach  out  to  stakeholders  in  developing 
any amendments to CROA.

Act, the agency has enforcement responsibilities under more than 50 other statutes 
and more than 30 rules governing specific industries and practices.

5 15 U.S.C. §§ 6101–6108. Among the principal ways the Telemarketing Act, as im-
plemented  by  the  Telemarketing  Sales  Rule,  strengthened  the  Commission’s  hand 
is  that  it  provides  a  predicate  for  the  Commission,  through  the  Department  of  Jus-
tice, to seek civil penalties for violations. The Commission is not empowered to seek 
civil  penalties  for  deceptive  or  unfair  practices  in  violation  of  Section  5  of  the  FTC 
Act. 

6 Civil penalty actions are filed by DOJ on behalf of the FTC. In general, for those 
statutes  or  rules  for  which  the  Commission  is  authorized  to  seek  civil  penalties, 
under  the  FTC  Act,  the  Commission  must  notify  the  Attorney  General  of  its  inten-
tion  to  commence,  defend,  or  intervene  in  any  civil  penalty  action  under  the  Act.

own name, using its own attorneys. Id.

ice Consumer Fraud Fund, and other costs and assessments totaling about $13,000.

11 When the Commission seeks relief in its own right, the Commission’s remedies 
are  limited  to  equitable  relief.  As  noted  above,  if  the  Commission  chooses  instead 
to seek a civil penalty for violations of the TSR, the Commission must refer the mat-
ter to DOJ.

lihood of success in obtaining or arranging a loan or of extension of credit for a per-
son.’’ The orders obtained by the FTC permanently barred the list brokers from pro-
viding  lists  to  telemarketers  engaging  in  illegal  business  practices  and  required 
them  to  pay  nearly  $200,000  combined  in  consumer  redress.  FTC  v.  Listdata  Com-

20 The  Commission  also  has  challenged  the  practice  of  brokers  selling  sensitive 
customer information to third parties without having reasonable procedures in place 
to verify the legitimacy of these third parties. Last year, the FTC brought a lawsuit 
against  ChoicePoint,  Inc.,  one  of  the  Nation’s  largest  data  brokers,  alleging  that  it 
violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the FTC Act by failing to screen prospec-
tive  subscribers  before  selling  them  sensitive  consumer  information.  U.S.  v. 
ChoicePoint,  Inc.,  CV–0198  (N.D.  Ga.,  consent  decree  entered  Jan.  30,  2006).  The 
Commission  alleged  that  ChoicePoint  approved  as  customers  identity  thieves  who 
lied  about  their  credentials  and  whose  applications  should  have  raised  obvious  red 
flags.  Under  the  terms  of  a  settlement,  ChoicePoint  paid  $10  million  in  civil  pen-
alties and $5 million in consumer redress, and agreed to implement new procedures 
to ensure that it provides sensitive data only to legitimate businesses for lawful pur-
poses.

24 Although  the  FTC  does  not  have  jurisdiction  over  banks,  the  FTC  coordinates 
with  the  Federal  Reserve  Board  and  the  other  banking  agencies  concerning  efforts 
to  help  banks  avoid  accepting  fraudulent  checks.  These  entities  generally  are  regu-
lated by the Federal banking regulatory agencies—the Federal Reserve System, the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Fed-
eral Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the National Credit Union Administration. 
Notably,  the  Commission  recently  authorized  FTC  staff  to  issue  an  opinion  letter 
to  NACHA-The  Electronic  Payments  Association  in  support  of  that  organization’s 
proposed  rule  changes  to  strengthen  safeguards  against  fraudulent  transactions  in 
the  payment  processing  industry.  The  letter  is  available  at  http://www.ftc.gov/os/

26 As  noted  above,  advance-fee  loan  schemes  are  per  se  illegal  under  the  TSR.  16 

C.F.R. 310.4(a)(4). 

27 While  the  Commission  remains  deeply  concerned  about  fraud  affecting  older 
consumers,  the  FTC’s  consumer  complaint  data  and  the  results  of  its  2003  fraud 
survey indicate that the experience of older consumers is not substantially different 
than  that  of  the  general  population.  See  http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/08/ 
fraudsurvey.shtm.  The  results  of  this  2003  survey  indicated  that  consumers  age  65 
or older did not experience more fraud than younger consumers. 

28 The FTC promulgated the Do Not Call provisions and other substantial amend-
ments  to  the  TSR  under  the  express  authority  granted  to  the  Commission  by  the 
Telemarketing  Act.  Specifically,  the  Telemarketing  Act  mandated  that  the  rule— 
now known as the TSR—include prohibitions against any pattern of unsolicited tele-
marketing calls ‘‘which the reasonable consumer would consider coercive or abusive 
of such consumer’s right to privacy,’’ as well as restrictions on the hours unsolicited 
telephone calls can be made to consumers.

32 As noted above, civil penalty actions are filed by DOJ on behalf of the FTC. The 
Commission’s ability to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices 
would  be  substantially  improved  by  legislation,  all  of  which  is  currently  under  con-
sideration by Congress, that provides the agency with civil penalty authority in the 
areas  of  data  security,  telephone  records  pretexting,  and  spyware,  similar  to  that 
provided  under  the  Telemarketing  Act.  Civil  penalties  are  especially  important  in 
these areas because the Commission’s traditional remedies, including equitable con-
sumer restitution and disgorgement, may be impracticable or not optimally effective 
in deterring unlawful acts. 

33 These Do Not Call cases are included in the 240 TSR cases noted above.

38 In the case of registration by telephone, the only personal information provided 
is the telephone number to be registered. In the case of Internet registration, a con-
sumer must provide, in addition to the telephone number(s) to be registered, a valid 
e-mail  address  to  which  a  confirmation  e-mail  message  is  sent.  Once  the  confirma-
tion  is  complete,  however,  the  e-mail  address  is  hashed  and  made  unusable.  Thus, 
only consumers’ telephone numbers are maintained in the database.

41 The  Commission  set  the  initial  fees  at  $25  per  area  code  of  data  with  a  max-
imum  annual  fee  of  $7,375.  See  68  Fed.  Reg.  45134  (July  31,  2003).  The  fees  have 
increased  each  year  to  its  current  level.  See  69  Fed.  Reg.  45580  (July  30,  2004);  70 
Fed. Reg. 43273 (July 27, 2005); and 71 Fed. Reg. 43048 (July 31, 2006). 

42 Such  exempt  organizations  include  entities  that  engage  in  outbound  telephone 
calls  to  consumers  to  induce  charitable  contributions,  for  political  fund  raising,  or 
to conduct surveys. They also include entities engaged solely in calls to persons with 
whom  they  have  an  established  business  relationship  or  from  whom  they  have  ob-
tained  express  written  agreement  to  call,  as  defined  by  the  Rule,  and  who  do  not 
access the National Registry for any other purpose. 

43 15 U.S.C. § 1679 et seq. 
44 CROA  prohibits  persons  from  advising  a  consumer  to  make  false  and  mis-
leading statements about a consumer’s credit worthiness or credit standing to a con-
sumer reporting agency. 15 U.S.C. § 1679b(a)(1). 

45 The  written  disclosure  must  explain  consumers’  right  to  dispute  inaccurate 
credit information directly to a credit reporting agency and to obtain a copy of their 
credit reports. It also must state that neither the credit repair organization nor the 
consumer  can  remove  accurate,  negative  information  from  his  or  her  report.  15 
U.S.C. § 1679(c). It also requires credit repair organizations to use written contracts 
that  include  the  terms  and  conditions  of  payment  and  other  specified  information.

actual or hypothetical scores or tools. See, ‘‘A Bill to Amend the Credit Repair Orga-

52 Of  course,  these  services  are  not  the  only  way  for  consumers  to  monitor  their 
credit file. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act gives every consumer the 
right  to  a  free  credit  report  from  each  of  the  three  major  credit  reporting  agencies 
once every 12 months.

sent decree) (complaint alleged that defendant falsely organized as 501(c)(3) tax-ex-
empt organization to take advantage of CROA exemption for nonprofits); and United 
States v. Jack Schrold, No. 98–6212–CIV–ZLOCH (S.D. Fla. 1998) (stipulated judg-
ment  and  order  for  permanent  injunction)  (complaint  alleged  that  defendant  at-
tempted  to  circumvent  CROA’s  prohibition  against  ‘‘credit  repair  organizations’’ 
charging money for services before the services are performed fully). 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Ms. Parnes, and let me apologize for 

mispronouncing your name earlier. 

But,  let  me  go  ahead  and  start  with  Do  Not  Call  questions.  You 
talk  about  how  the  program  has  been  a  great  success—I’d  like  to 
put  some  quantifications  on  that,  if  I  can.  How  many  people  have 
signed up for it and what can we do to improve it? 

Ms. PARNES. Well, there are 146 million separate telephone num-
bers that have been registered on the Do Not Call list. Our experi-
ence is that it really is, it really is working, it’s working well. There 
are—we  believe  that  we  have  the  legislative  tools  to  pursue  those 
who  are  violating  Do  Not  Call,  and  as  I  indicated,  compliance  is 
generally  high.  And  I  think  part  of  the  reason  it’s  high,  is  because 
legitimate  businesses  know  how  strongly  consumers  feel  about  re-
ceiving unwanted telemarketing calls. 

Senator  PRYOR.  You  say  compliance  is  ‘‘generally’’  high—have 

you had some problems on the enforcement side? 

Ms.  PARNES.  We  have  engaged  in  some  enforcement,  absolutely. 
We’ve—since  the  Do  Not  Call  Registry  was  adopted,  I  believe—I 
believe we’ve brought 17 cases, challenging Do Not Call violations. 
Senator  PRYOR.  And  have  those  been  concluded  successfully,  for 

the most part? 

Ms.  PARNES.  They  have  been.  They  have  been.  One  of  the  cases 
against  a  telemarketers,  DIRECTV,  involved—at  the  time—the 
largest  civil  penalty  that  we  had  obtained  in  the  consumer  protec-
tion area. 

Senator PRYOR. Let me ask about Do Not Call, and the structure 

of it. 

With  the  advent,  and  the  explosion,  really,  of  cell  phone  usage, 
and  Voice-over-Internet  Protocol  phones,  VoIP,  service—are  those 
included  in  the  current  Do  Not  Call  Registry,  and  if  so,  are  all  of 
those phone numbers included? 

Ms.  PARNES.  Well,  cell  phones  are  interesting—every  so  often 
there  is  an  e-mail  that  goes  around  on  the  Internet,  encouraging 
everybody  to  register  their  cell  phones  on  the  Do  Not  Call  List.  In 
fact,  telemarketing  calls  to  cell  phones  really  shouldn’t  be  a  prob-
lem.  The  FCC  rule  prohibits  telemarketers  from  using  automated 
dialers  to  call  cell  phones,  and  automated  dialers  are  really  the 
standard  in  the  industry.  So,  as  a  practical  matter,  telemarketers 
can’t call cell phones. 

But,  we  do  register  any  phone.  So,  if  a  consumer  is  concerned, 

they can go ahead and register their cell phone on the Registry. 

In terms of VoIP, one of the things we find generally, is that con-
vergence  of  technologies—Internet  and  telephone  services,  I  mean, 
that  poses  challenges  in  the  consumer  protection  area.  We  held  4

days of hearings at the Commission last November, to look at con-
vergence  and  other  emerging  issues  in  the  consumer  protection 
area. So far we haven’t seen a problem, we’ve actually brought one 
telemarketing  case  involving  VoIP  technology.  But  certainly,  if  we 
see a problem, we would—and it raises legislative issues, we would 
come to the Committee with that. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you. 
Ms.  Parnes,  as  you  know,  the  Committee  and  my  staff,  and  the 
Committee staff and the Senators and their staffs have been work-
ing  to  reauthorize  the  Do  Not  Call  Registry,  and  I  want  to  thank 
you  and  your  staff  for  being  available,  and  for  helping  in  that  en-
deavor.  Because  you  all  have  provided  some  very  valuable  insight, 
and I want to thank you for that. 

And  also,  I  think  you  know  the  reauthorization  bill  is  on  this 
week’s  calendar  for  the  Thursday  markup  in  this  Committee,  so  I 
want  to  thank  the  Chairman  and  the  co-Chairman  again  for  their 
assistance  on  that.  And,  I  understand  that  you’ve  had  a  chance  to 
look at the legislation? 

Ms. PARNES. I have looked at it, yes. 
Senator PRYOR. Do you think it meets the needs of the program? 

Do you think it is good legislation? 

Ms.  PARNES.  Well,  we—the  one  recommendation  that  we  had  is 
that  the  reauthorization  should  statutorily  set  the  fees  for  access-
ing  the  Registry.  As  the  system  stands  right  now,  the  Commission 
engages in an annual rulemaking to set the fees, and it just seems 
as if—from the perspective of the industry, as well as the Commis-
sion—having the certainty of a set fee would be very useful. 

Senator PRYOR. OK, thank you for that. 
Let  me  also  ask  this:  with  the  laws  that  currently  exist  there— 

when you register, you register for 5 years, is that right? 

Ms. PARNES. Yes. 
Senator  PRYOR.  So,  you’re  going  to  start  to  see  the  people  who 
registered initially to sunset here soon. Do you have a sense of how 
many  will  sunset  in  the  first  year?  Do  you  know  that  number  off 
the top of your head? 
Ms. PARNES. I don’t. 
Senator PRYOR. OK. 
Ms.  PARNES.  But  I’m  certain—I’m  actually  certain  that  we  can 

easily get that—— 

tion—— 

Senator  PRYOR.  That’s  really  more  of  a  background  for  my  ques-

Ms. PARNES.—for you. 
Senator  PRYOR.—and  that  is,  what  will  the  Federal  Trade  Com-
mission  do  to  try  to  educate  consumers  that  their  registration  will 
expire and that they need to re-register. Do we have any plans for 
that? 

Ms.  PARNES.  We  do.  We  were  very  sensitive  to  the  need  to  roll 
out the Do Not Call Registry very carefully when it was just imple-
mented.  And  we—I  think—did  a  very  good  job  of  explaining  the 
Registry,  and  getting  the  word  out  to  consumers—I  believe  in  the 
first  two  or  3  days,  before  people  even,  you  know,  knew  how  well 
this  was  going  to  work,  we  registered  over  10  million  phones.  So, 
we  will  put  together  a  consumer  education  campaign,  and  we  will

definitely reach out to the media, both local and national, to get the 
word out about re-registration. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Great.  Well,  thank  you  because  on  that  type  of 

program, consumer information is very critical. 

Let  me  ask  now,  let  me  change  gears  and  ask  about  CROA.  I 
know  that  this  is  something  that  you’re  also  very  familiar  with, 
and you’ve been very helpful in providing your insights to the Com-
mittee, and to my staff, and I appreciate that. 

You may not know off the top of your head, but how many cases 

have you brought under CROA, do you know? 

Ms.  PARNES.  I  believe  that  the  FTC  alone  has  brought  about  60 
cases  in  the  last  9  or  10  years,  but  working  together  with  our  law 
enforcement partners on the Federal and State level, we’ve partici-
pated in sweeps, and in total, we’ve brought over 100 cases. 

Senator  PRYOR.  All  right,  now,  many  people—including  your-
self—have  expressed  reservations  about  credit  monitoring  services 
being  subject  to  specific  requirements  under  CROA.  A  number  of 
proposals have been suggested and offered to amend this aspect of 
CROA,  including  carve-outs  for  specific  entities  and  carve-outs  for 
specific  practices.  In  this  debate,  tell  us  where  you  are  on  those 
issues, and why? 

Ms.  PARNES.  Of  course  credit  monitoring  services,  as  you  men-
tioned,  can  be  very  useful  for  consumers.  And  we  understand  the 
credit  reporting  agencies  have  offered  these  services,  and  have  ex-
pressed  concern  about  coverage  under  CROA.  And  while  we  are— 
and have been—very sympathetic about this, it’s been very difficult 
to come up with some way of crafting an exemption. 

We  would  not  favor  a  status-based  exemption  for  the  credit  re-
porting  agencies,  because  it  would  certainly  give  them  an  unfair 
competitive advantage over others that offer credit monitoring serv-
ices, and would have to comply with CROA. 

And  in  terms  of  defining  credit  monitoring  services  alone  and 
just  carving  that  out  from  the  statute—our  experience  with  credit 
repair outfits is that they use every exemption to try and evade the 
law. 

And  so,  I  could  easily  see  your  typical  fraudulent  credit  repair 
guy,  you  know,  setting  up  a  scam  that  would  take  advantage  of  a 
credit monitoring exemption, and that’s really our concern. 

Senator  PRYOR.  So  tell  me  what  you  think  the  best  approach 

would be for the new law. 

Ms.  PARNES.  I  think  that,  over  the  years  as  we  have,  as  we’ve 
really  thought  about  this,  we  just,  you  know—so  far  we  have  not 
been  able  to  come  up  with  anything  that  we  could  really  rec-
ommend  as  carving  out  an  appropriate  exemption,  and  still  pro-
viding adequate protection to consumers. 

Senator PRYOR. OK. 
Let’s see—you mentioned in your testimony that Congress should 
continue  to  reach  out  to  stakeholders  in  developing  any  amend-
ments  to  CROA—do  you  think  that  we’ve  found  some  common 
ground on changing CROA, or—? 

Ms.  PARNES.  I  think  the  common  ground  is  that,  you  know,  we 
all  agree  that—that  credit  monitoring  offered  by—I  think  we  all 
agree with the general principles: Credit monitoring offered by the 
CRAs doesn’t particularly pose a risk to consumers.

I  don’t  think  that  we’ve  come  up  with  a  solution  to  carve  out  an 
exemption  from  the  statute.  And,  it’s  something  that  we  will—we 
would  be  happy  to  kind  of  head  to,  yet  again.  But,  but  we’ve  cer-
tainly tried to—and haven’t yet—come up with a fix there. 

Senator PRYOR. OK, great. 
I’d  like  to  move  onto  the  second  panel.  I  want  to  thank  you  for 
your  responses  to  questions.  I  want  to  leave  the  record  open  for  2 
weeks and allow my colleagues to submit questions in writing. And 
so, don’t be shocked if you receive some written questions from the 
Committee. I know that we have a hectic day in the Senate today, 
with  a  lot  of  things  happening  on  the  floor  and  other  Committees 
meeting. So, my colleagues are trying to get here as best they can. 
But, thank you. Your statement will be made part of the record. 

You’re free to go. 

Ms. PARNES. Thank you very much. 
Senator PRYOR. We’ll get the second panel up here. 
Thank you. Thank you for your time and your testimony. 
Now, I’d like to go ahead and introduce the second panel and call 
everyone’s name. And I’d like to put them in this order, if possible: 
Mr.  Richard  Johnson,  Member  of  the  Board  of  Directors  at  AARP; 
Mr.  Jerry  Cerasale,  Senior  Vice  President,  Governmental  Affairs, 
Direct  Marketing  Association;  Ms.  Robin  Holland,  Senior  Vice 
President of Global Operations, Equifax; Ms. Joanne Faulkner, tes-
tifying  on  behalf  of  the  National  Association  of  Consumer  Advo-
cates;  and  Mr.  Steve  St.  Clair,  Assistant  Attorney  General  for  the 
State of Iowa. 

I want to welcome all of you all to the Committee. 
I  would  like  to  start  with  Mr.  Johnson  and  Mr.  Cerasale.  We’re 
going  to  have  5  minutes  to  make  opening  statements,  and  then 
we’ll have some questions for you. Go ahead. 

STATEMENT OF RICHARD JOHNSON, MEMBER, 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AARP 

Mr.  JOHNSON.  Thank  you.  Chairman  Pryor,  thank  you  so  much 

for the opportunity to testify at this important matter. 

AARP  strongly  supported  the  establishment  of  the  Do  Not  Call 
Registry,  or  the  DNCR.  And  we  thank  you  for  your  efforts  in  this 
area.  And  we  also  commend  the  regulators  for  their  implementa-
tion and enforcement of this important consumer protection. 

The DNCR is highly successful. The public overwhelmingly views 
telemarketing  sales  calls  as  an  invasion  of  privacy.  It  is  not  sur-
prising, then, that as of now, there are 146 million phone numbers 
registered with the DNCR. Yet, despite the success of the program, 
more can be done to protect the consumers. 

For  example,  in  a  2005  AARP  study,  62  percent  of  the  respond-
ents  with  telephone  numbers  registered  with  the  DNCR  indicated 
that  they  still  receive  more  telemarketing  calls  than  they  would 
like. 

We urge Congress and regulators do the following: 
First,  ensure  that  the  DNCR  continues  to  be  funded  by  the  tele-
marketing  industry.  Taxpayers  and  consumers  should  not  have  to 
pay for the cost of operating the system. 

Second, prohibit all unsolicited, pre-recorded telemarketing calls, 
including  those  to  establish  business  customers.  AARP  surveys

16 

show  that  customers  and  consumers  consider  pre-recorded  tele-
marketing calls particularly coercive or abusive. 

Third,  strengthen  call-abandonment  rules.  Telemarketers  typi-
cally  abandon  calls  when  predictive  dialing  reaches  more  than  one 
person at the same time. Consumers pick up and hear a click, and 
older  consumers  are  especially  concerned  about  who  was  trying  to 
call  them.  Abandoned  calls  should  include  identifying  information, 
in  order  to  remove  some  of  the  uncertainty  that  currently  exists 
when older persons hear the click. 

Fourth,  narrow  the  definition  of  established  business  relation-
ships.  The  current  definition  is  too  broad.  For  example,  the  con-
sumer  who  simply  inquires  about  a  company’s  products  and  serv-
ices,  should  not  have  to  deal  with  incessant  telemarketing  calls 
from  that  company.  Regulators  should  change  the  definition  to  re-
quire that the relationship be ongoing. 

Unfortunately,  even  these  consumer  protections  cannot  stop 
thieves from committing telemarketing fraud, which is already ille-
gal.  In  our  written  testimony,  we  provided  statistics  to  show  that 
telemarketing  fraud  is  largely  targeted  at  older  Americans,  who 
have a lifetime of savings that the thieves go after. 

Real  people  behind  the  statistics  bear  the  burden  of  this  fraud. 
Consider a few examples: Richard Guthrie was a 92-year-old Army 
veteran, living on just $800 in Social Security benefits each month. 
InfoUSA, a company which compiles vast databases of consumer in-
formation, sold Mr. Guthrie’s information to thieves, who defrauded 
him of $100,000 in a telemarketing fraud. 

In  another  case,  86-year-old  Claire  Wilson  was  desperate  for 
money  when  her  son-in-law  needed  a  liver  transplant.  She  was 
conned out of $8,000 in savings, after receiving a call that she had 
won $100,000 in a Canadian lottery. 

These are just a few of the thousands of examples of older Ameri-

cans who have suffered because of telemarketing fraud. 

There  are  clearly  many  issues  for  Congress,  regulators  and  the 
states  to  address.  One  of  the  key  areas  for  Congress  to  investigate 
and  potentially  take  action  on,  relates  to  how  thieves  get  money 
from  the  victims’  bank  accounts.  Often,  this  happens  through  de-
mand drafts, unsigned paper checks. 

Demand drafts are so often connected to fraudulent transactions, 
that  Attorneys  General  in  35  states,  plus  the  District  of  Columbia 
and  American  Samoa,  have  called  for  an  outright  ban  on  them. 
AARP  also  believes  that  the  FTC  should  strengthen  the  Tele-
marketing  Sales  Rule  to  address  problems  that  remain,  including 
unauthorized  access  to  consumer  bank  accounts,  disclosures  re-
garding  premiums,  and  prize  promotions,  repeat  calling  of  tele-
marketing  fraud  victims,  and  the  contacting  of  consumers  who 
have placed their telephone numbers on the DNCR. Additional civil 
and  criminal  penalties  should  be  imposed  for  violations  of  tele-
marketing  laws  and  regulations,  including  prison  terms  for  those 
who knowingly deceive consumers. 

In  summary,  the  Do  Not  Call  Registry  has  been  largely  success-
ful.  But  consumers  still  receive  unwanted  telemarketing  calls. 
AARP  recommends  strengthening  the  DNCR  with  additional  con-
sumer  protections.  Federal  and  State  lawmakers  should  work  to-
gether  to  establish  a  strong  set  of  anti-telemarketing  fraud  laws

and regulations to bring enforcement action against thieves. Thank 
you. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Johnson follows: 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RICHARD JOHNSON, MEMBER, BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AARP 
Chairman  Pryor,  Ranking  Member  Sununu,  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee, 
on  behalf  of  AARP’s  39  million  members,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify 
on the Do Not Call Registry (DNCR) and telemarketing fraud. 
Do Not Call Registry 

AARP’s members are among the millions of Americans who have taken the initia-
tive  to  place  their  phone  numbers  (over  132  million  as  of  2006) 1 into  the  DNCR  in 
an  effort  to  reduce  the  number  of  unwanted  telemarketing  calls.  Survey  results 
show  that  the  Registry  has  been  very  successful  from  the  consumer  standpoint.  A 
December 2005 Harris Interactive survey 2 found that 76 percent of respondents had 
signed up for the Registry, and 92 percent of them had received fewer telemarketing 
calls. 

AARP’s  own  surveys  indicate  that  an  overwhelming  number  of  people  view  tele-
marketing  sales  calls  as  an  invasion  of  privacy  and  have  supported  the  creation  of 
‘‘do not call’’ lists as a way to stop these unwanted intrusions.3 The DNCR is consid-
ered  one  of  the  best  consumer  programs  ever  implemented,  and  regulators  should 
be  commended  for  their  capable  implementation  and  enforcement  of  this  important 
consumer  protection.  There  is  more  that  can  be  done  to  enhance  the  protections  of 
the  DNCR,  and  AARP  believes  that  it  should  continue  to  be  funded  by  the  tele-
marketing  industry,  rather  than  by  taxpayers  or  consumers  who  place  their  name 
on the DNCR. 

Notwithstanding the success of the DNCR, consumers still believe they receive too 
many telemarketing calls. For example, in a 2005 study conducted by AARP, 62 per-
cent  of  respondents  with  telephone  numbers  registered  with  the  DNCR  indicated 
that  they  still  received  more  telemarketing  calls  than  they  would  like.  In  order  to 
make the DNCR an even bigger success for consumers, the FTC should adopt addi-
tional rules to further decrease the number of telemarketing calls. 

AARP is pleased that the FTC is considering changes in two areas that could help 
achieve this outcome: (1) prohibiting all unsolicited prerecorded telemarketing calls, 
including those from sellers to established business customers, and (2) retaining and 
strengthening  call  abandonment  measures.  AARP  recommends  that  the  FTC  act  to 
further  relieve  consumers  of  unwanted  telemarketing  calls  from  companies  with 
which they have an established business relationship. 
Prerecorded Telemarketing Calls 

AARP  believes  that  all  unsolicited  prerecorded  telemarketing  calls,  including 
those  from  sellers  to  established  business  customers  should  be  prohibited.  Con-
sumers consider prerecorded telemarketing calls a particularly ‘‘coercive or abusive’’ 
infringement on their right to privacy.4 

AARP  believes  that  the  prohibition  on  prerecorded  telemarketing  calls  should 
apply whether the calls are received by a person, an answering machine, or a voice 
mail  system.  A  simple  prohibition  on  prerecorded  telemarketing  calls  is  the  best 
course  for  consumers.  AARP  has  submitted  comments  to  this  effect  to  the  FTC  in 
its ongoing proceeding reviewing the Telemarketing Sales Rule. 
Retaining and Strengthening Call Abandonment Measures 

Telemarketers  typically  abandon  calls  when  predictive  dialing  techniques  reach 
more than one person at the same time; they speak to one person and drop the call 
to  the  others  who  pick  up.  Unfortunately,  in  far  too  many  cases,  the  consumer 
rushes  to  pick  up  the  phone  only  to  hear  dead  air  or  a  click  as  the  phone  call  is 
terminated with these ‘‘abandoned’’ calls. 

For  mid-life  and  older  Americans,  these  calls  are  more  than  just  a  nuisance.  In 
addition  to  the  inconvenience  and  risk  associated  with  rushing  to  answer  the  tele-

to  the  entire  (online  and  offline)  population.  For  more  information  on  the  survey,  see  http://

phone,  there  is  the  uncertainty  and  concern  of  the  consumer,  especially  for  women 
living  alone.  When  no  one  is  on  the  other  end  of  the  line,  or  a  consumer  hears  a 
‘‘click’’  when  answering  the  telephone,  a  number  of  different  scenarios  may  begin 
to  play  out  in  the  individual’s  mind.  Is  the  caller  attempting  to  know  if  the  con-
sumer  is  home  alone  or  away  from  the  home?  Was  this  an  important  call  that  the 
consumer  just  missed  answering?  For  these  reasons,  abandoned  calls  should  be  re-
quired  to  include  some  identifying  information  conveyed  to  consumers  in  order  to 
remove  some  of  the  uncertainty  that  currently  exists  when  older  persons  answer 
abandoned calls. 

AARP  is  concerned  with  proposals  by  industry  to  change  the  rules  in  a  way  that 
could  increase  the  number  of  calls  abandoned  by  telemarketers.  A  change  in  the 
measure  for  abandoned  calls  could  provide  an  opportunity  for  telemarketers  to 
‘‘game’’ the system and alter call abandonment rates over the course of each calling 
campaign.  Instead,  we  reiterate  our  recommendation  that  the  rule  be  retained  and 
strengthened to provide stronger consumer protections outlined above. 
Established Business Relationship Calls 

AARP has continually expressed the concern that the current definition of an ‘‘es-
tablished  business  relationship’’  is  too  broad,  increasing  the  likelihood  that  con-
sumers get unwanted telemarketing calls. Specifically, we do not believe every con-
tact between a consumer and a business should establish a business relationship be-
tween  them.  For  example,  a  consumer  who  merely  inquires  or  provides  an  opinion 
about a company’s products and services should not be subjected to subsequent tele-
marketing calls from the company. 

We suggest that the FTC change the definition of ‘‘established’’ to require that the 
relationship be ongoing, i.e., where the consumer has completed a transaction (mak-
ing  a  purchase  or  a  payment)  with  a  company  within  the  12  consecutive  months 
prior  to  the  call.  In  addition,  if  a  consumer  requests  placement  on  a  company’s  Do 
Not Call list, that request should be extended to all of the company’s affiliates with 
whom the consumer does not have an ongoing relationship. 
Telemarketing Fraud 

Despite  the  success  of  the  Registry,  and  the  requirement  that  telemarketers  re-
view their lists against the DNCR every month, telemarketing fraud—in particular, 
fraud  targeting  older  Americans—remains  a  major  problem.  Thieves  continue  to 
evade  the  law  to  commit  fraud  that  can  potentially  wipe  out  the  lifetime  savings 
of unsuspecting older Americans. 

According  to  the  National  Consumer  League,5 50  percent  of  telemarketing  fraud 
victims  were  50  or  older  and  32  percent  were  60  or  older.  At  the  other  end  of  the 
spectrum, people under 30 represented just 15 percent of all telemarketing fraud re-
ports, and those under 20 just 1 percent. The NCL statistics also show that 46 per-
cent  of  thieves  initially  target  people  by  phone,  suggesting  that  even  in  the  age  of 
the  Internet,  telemarketing  fraud  remains  a  significant  problem.  AARP  research 
sheds  light  on  part  of  the  reason  that  seniors  are  targeted  in  telemarketing  fraud 
schemes: most older victims do not realize that the voice on the phone could belong 
to someone who is trying to steal their money.6 

In 2005, the average reported loss for telemarketing fraud was $2,892.7 The Fed-
eral  Trade  Commission  estimates  that  consumers  lose  $40  billion  a  year  in  tele-
marketing fraud, and the FBI estimates that there are 14,000 illegal telephone sales 
operations  active  each  day.8 But  behind  the  statistics  are  real  people  who  are 
scammed—sometimes out of their entire life savings. Consider the following: 

• A recent New York Times story highlighted telemarketing fraud against Richard 
Guthrie,  a  92-year-old  Army  veteran  living  off  of  approximately  $800  in  Social 
Security benefits each month. He said that he once enjoyed telemarketing calls 
because  they  helped  stem  the  loneliness  he  had  felt  since  his  wife’s  death.9 
infoUSA,  a  company  which  compiles  vast  databases  of  consumer  information, 
sold  Mr.  Guthrie’s  information  to  thieves  who  defrauded  him  of  $100,000 
through telemarketing.

• 86-year-old  Claire  Wilson,  desperate  for  money  when  her  son-in-law  needed  a 
liver transplant, was conned out of $8,000 in savings after receiving a call that 
she  had  ‘‘won’’  $100,000  in  a  Canadian  lottery.10 The  Canadian  lottery  scam  is 
one  of  the  Federal  Trade  Commission’s  top  two  scams,  costing  unsuspecting 
Americans $120 million each year.11 

• Patricia  Candelaria,  83,  fell  prey  to  a  similar  scam,  paying  nearly  $200,000  on 
supposed  taxes  and  insurance  for  a  sweepstakes  prize  that  did  not  exist.12 The 
supposed  contest  representative,  who  identified  himself  as  David  Sommers  of 
the  National  Contest  Association,  called  Ms.  Candelaria  incessantly  and  sent 
her invoices for past due payments. 

• 50-year-old  Yvette  Jones,  a  single  mother  and  office  worker,  was  scammed  by 
someone  who  identified  herself  as  Lisa  James  of  the  Department  of  Housing 
and  Urban  Development.13 Jones  had  submitted  several  applications  for  what 
she  thought  were  government  grants  to  cover  the  cost  of  her  new  roof,  and  the 
fraudster  told  Ms.  Jones  that  she  had  been  awarded  a  $5,500  grant  that  re-
quired  a  $349  application  fee.  Ms.  Jones  paid  it  but  of  course  never  received 
the grant. She later found out that she had visited bogus websites that had put 
her information into ‘‘sucker lists.’’ 

Telemarketing  fraud  is  already  illegal,  but  more  can  and  should  be  done.  One  of 
the  issues  we  recommend  Congress  study  and  potentially  take  action  on  relates  to 
how  thieves  are  able  to  take  money  out  of  their  victims’  bank  accounts.  Often,  this 
happens through ‘‘demand drafts,’’ unsigned paper checks that state ‘‘authorized by 
drawer’’  or  ‘‘signature  on  file’’  in  lieu  of  the  signature.  The  FTC  addressed  the  use 
of  demand  drafts  to  commit  fraud  in  testimony  before  the  Senate  Banking  Com-
mittee: 

Demand  draft  fraud,  or  the  unauthorized  debiting  of  a  consumer’s  checking  ac-
count,  is  a  growing  problem.  Currently,  it  is  the  favorite  method  of  fraudulent 
actors for taking consumers’ money through fraudulent telemarketing and other 
scams. . . . 
Many  fraudulent  actors  persuade  consumers,  either  over  the  telephone  or 
through  the  mail,  to  divulge  their  checking  account  numbers  by  telling  them 
that their bank account numbers are needed to verify prizes or to deposit prize 
money directly into consumers’ bank accounts. In other cases, fraudulent actors 
tell  consumers  that  only  a  small  amount  will  be  withdrawn,  but  in  fact  with-
draw  huge  amounts  of  money  from  the  consumer’s  checking  account.  As  a  fur-
ther  insult,  the  unauthorized  demand  draft  may  generate  significant  overdraft 
charges  to  the  consumer  if  the  consumer  does  not  have  the  additional  money 
in  the  first  instance  or  has  written  subsequent  checks.  Little  do  consumers 
know  that  once  they  give  fraudulent  actors  access  to  their  bank  account  infor-
mation, their money will disappear.14 

Demand  drafts  are  currently  the  subject  of  a  case  against  Payment  Processing 
Center  (PPC)  brought  by  the  U.S.  attorney  in  Philadelphia.  According  to  this  law-
suit,  fraudulent  telemarketers  deposited  $142  million  in  demand  drafts  from  PPC 
into their bank accounts.15 

Demand  drafts,  unlike  Automated  Clearing  House  (ACH)  debits,  are  not  subject 
to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA). Attor-
neys  General  in  35  states  plus  the  District  of  Columbia  and  American  Samoa  have 
called for an outright ban on demand drafts because they are so frequently used to 
commit fraud against consumers.16 This is clearly an issue ripe for further consider-
ation by Congress.

AARP  believes  that  the  FTC  should  strengthen  the  Telemarketing  Sales  Rule. 
Rulemaking  and  enforcement  efforts  should  address  problems  that  remain  in  the 
telemarketing industry, such as online fraud, unauthorized access to consumer bank 
accounts,  disclosures  regarding  premiums  and  prize  promotions,  repeat  calling  of 
telemarketing  fraud  victims,  and  the  contacting  of  consumers  who  have  placed 
themselves on the DNCR. The Department of Justice should also be vigorous in en-
forcing efforts to combat telemarketing fraud. 

Civil  and  criminal  penalties  should  be  imposed  for  violations  of  telemarketing 
laws  and  regulations,  including  prison  terms  for  those  who  knowingly  deceive  con-
sumers. These penalties should be assessed based on the degree of fraud committed, 
regardless  of  the  actual  dollar  amount  lost.  Appropriate  investigative  and  enforce-
ment tools should also be available to regulators. 

States  are  also  key  players  in  this  area.  Because  of  the  serious  gap  in  consumer 
protections  in  the  area  of  telemarketing,  states  play  an  invaluable  role  in  pre-
venting, deterring, and prosecuting telemarketing fraud. Reducing the pervasiveness 
of telemarketing fraud and obtaining restitution for victims requires strong enforce-
ment by all levels of government. 
Summary 

In summary, the Do Not Call Registry has been largely successful, but AARP rec-
ommends  additional  consumer  protections.  Such  protections  include  the  prohibition 
of  all  unsolicited  prerecorded  telemarketing  calls  and  narrowing  of  the  definition  of 
‘‘established  business  relationship.’’  We  also  believe  that  industry  should  continue 
to  fund  the  DNCR;  this  cost  should  not  be  borne  by  taxpayers  or  consumers  who 
place their name on the Registry. 

Despite the success of the DNCR, telemarketing fraud remains a significant prob-
lem  for  older  Americans,  who  are  targeted  because  of  their  higher  level  of  savings 
than the general population. Federal and state lawmakers need to work together to 
establish a strong set of anti-telemarketing fraud laws and regulations and to bring 
enforcement actions against thieves. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you. 
Mr. Cerasale? 

STATEMENT OF JERRY CERASALE, 

SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS, 

DIRECT MARKETING ASSOCIATION, INC. 

Mr.  CERASALE.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Pryor.  Thank  you  very 
much  for  inviting  us  here,  the  Direct  Marketing  Association  is  an 
association  of  multi-channel  marketers,  their  suppliers,  use  the 
mail,  the  Internet,  television,  radio  and  telephone  to  reach  cus-
tomers, and potential customers. These issues today are important 
to them, as they try and reach those customers. 

We thank you for your leadership concerning the fees for the Do 
Not Call list, which has been very, very successful. Since its incep-
tion in October of 2003, when there were 56 million phone numbers 
on  the  list  at  that  time—less  than  4  years  ago—fees  grew  from 
$7,300-plus  to  $17,000—about  263  percent.  If  you  look  at  2002, 
with the estimated $3,000 fee, the increase is double that 263 per-
cent. 

The  DMA  has  run  a  Do  Not  Call  Registry,  and  still  does  it  for 
three  States,  with  a  cost  of  $700  a  year.  Now,  granted  it  has  a 
smaller  number  of  phone  numbers  on  it.  But  that  $700  would  in-
clude a supplier purchasing it for all of its customers, not each cus-
tomer  having  to  purchase  that  $700.  We  believe  that  the  fees 
should cover the cost of running the Do Not Call Registry. It should 
not  be  a  tax  on  marketers,  to  cover  other  Federal  Trade  Commis-
sion  programs.  And  we  support  your  efforts  to  put  a  cap—set  the 
fee with a cost-of-living, or CPI index increase. 

Moreover,  one  other  problem  with  the  list  is  the  hygiene  of  the 
list.  Our  members  tell  us  that  30  to  40  percent  of  the  phone  num-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  08:10 Sep 17, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\75784.TXT JACKIE

21 

bers  on  the  list  are  not  usable—meaning  they  are  business  num-
bers, they are fax numbers, they are abandoned telephone numbers 
that  have  not  been  removed  from  the  list,  and  they  also—as  Ms. 
Parnes said—include cell phone numbers, which are covered by the 
TCPA,  and  can  be  added  on  here,  but  increase  the  size  of  the  list, 
increase  the  cost  of  the  list  to  marketers,  to  the  Government,  and 
increase the probability of errors, as you have more and more num-
bers. So, we hope that we can do something to try and increase the 
hygiene of this list. 

We  don’t  know  the  specifics  underlying  the  article  in  The  New 
York Times which promoted—prompted Senator McCaskill to write 
her  letter  to  the  Federal  Trade  Commission.  But  the  DMA  has  a 
longstanding,  self-regulatory  program,  which  looks  toward  correc-
tion—correction  of  errors  in  trying  to  fix  it.  If  there  is  no  coopera-
tion,  the  DMA  will  then  publicize  the  name  of  the  company,  take 
other  corrective  actions,  such  as  removing  them  from  the  DMA 
membership  publicly,  transferring  the  information  to  the  appro-
priate authorities. 

Two  years  ago,  the  DMA  was  concerned  with  the  issue  of  list 
compilers,  and  trying  to  clarify  its  guidelines  for  them,  and  we 
started  a  revision  process,  which  we  have  since  completed.  In  the 
area of sensitive information, which we define as including seniors, 
we  now  require—for  DMA  membership  and  all  list  compilers—ex-
amine  the  promotion  for  appropriateness,  so  that  we  ensure  that 
the  compiler  themselves  has  a  duty—an  affirmative  duty,  in  sen-
sitive  information—to  take  a  look  at  what  the  offer  is.  We  hope 
that  this  will  strengthen  our  guidelines,  and  clarify  the  guidelines 
for  compilers,  and  try  and  help  reduce  fraud  initially,  right  away, 
in this process. 

These  individuals  are  the  customers  of  our  members—or  poten-
tial  customers  of  our  members.  They  have  to  treat  them  as  such, 
and  that’s  what  our  guidelines  are  meant  to  do,  and  try  and  push 
forward ethical business practices. 

Thank you, and we’re ready for any questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JERRY CERASALE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT,

Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  I  am  Jerry 
Cerasale, Senior Vice President for Government Affairs of the Direct Marketing As-

telemarketers  to  access  the  registry,  and  issues  related  to  the  operation  of  the  reg-
istry.  In  addition,  we  would  like  to  address  issues  relating  to  list  compilers  raised 
by  Senator  McCaskill  and,  in  that  context,  describe  DMA’s  list  compiler  guidelines. 
II. Fees Paid by Telemarketers to Access the Do-Not-Call Registry 

DMA  strongly  supports  capping  fees  imposed  on  telemarketers  to  access  the  do- 
not-call  registry.  We  thank  Senator  Pryor  for  his  leadership  in  this  area.  Current 
fees  are  sufficient  and,  in  fact,  we  believe,  higher  than  necessary  to  administer  the 
do-not-call registry. Fees collected from telemarketers should be used to operate the 
registry  and  not  for  broader  enforcement  of  the  telemarketing  rules  or  other  pur-
poses.  Finally,  we  believe  that  the  operator  of  the  registry  should  improve  the  hy-
giene of the list to ensure it does not include changed telephone numbers. 
A. Current Fees are Sufficient and, in Fact, Higher than Necessary to Administer the 

Do-Not-Call Registry and Should be Capped 

The  level  of  increase  in  do-not-call  registry  access  fees  seen  in  the  last  few  years 
makes it clear that Congress needs to establish a cap on the cost for access. In addi-
tion, any necessary fee adjustments should be tied to a fixed index such as the con-
sumer  price  index  or  the  rate  of  inflation.  The  Federal  Trade  Commission  (‘‘FTC’’ 
or  ‘‘Commission’’),  in  2002,  proposed  to  cap  the  maximum  annual  fee  per  tele-
marketer to obtain access to the entire registry at $3,000.1 By the time the Commis-
sion  made  the  registry  available  in  2003,  the  cost  for  access  had  already  increased 
to $7,375, a 145 percent increase.2 Less than a year later, the Commission increased 
fees  67  percent  to  $11,000.3 The  following  year,  the  Commission  increased  fees  by 
40  percent  to  $15,400.4 In  2006,  the  Commission  increased  fees  to  $17,050.5 That 
was an 11 percent increase. This amounts to a 263 percent increase in 4 years. 

DMA  has  a  great  deal  of  experience  in  operating  its  own  telemarketing  suppres-
sion  list,  the  Telephone  Preference  Service  (‘‘TPS’’),  as  well  as  in  administering  the 
state  lists  of  Pennsylvania,  Maine,  and  Wyoming.6 This  experience  also  indicates  a 
much  less  costly  means  of  running  a  registry.  DMA’s  entire  list  was  available  for 
entities  to  purchase  for  $700  per  year.  While  the  Commission’s  registry  contains 
many  more  numbers  than  does  the  TPS,  we  do  not  believe  that  the  $17,050  fee— 
more  than  24  times  the  cost  of  the  TPS—is  justified  by  the  incremental  costs  that 
correspond to the increased amount of numbers on the registry. 
B.  Fees  Collected  from  Telemarketers  should  be  Used  Solely  to  Operate  the  Registry 
and  not  for  Broader  Enforcement  of  the  Telemarketing  Rules  or  Other  Purposes 
DMA  believes  that  fees  collected  for  providing  access  to  the  registry  should  be 
used  solely  to  administer  the  operations  of  do-not-call  registry.  An  analysis  of  the 
costs to run the registry and the amounts collected by the Commission suggest that 
a  significant  amount  of  the  money  spent  is  on  enforcement  and  other  costs.  DMA 
does not believe that the registry fees should be used for telemarketing enforcement 
based  on  fraud  or  other  violations  of  the  Telemarketing  Sales  Rule,  even  where 
there may also be an incidental violation of the registry. Prior to the establishment 
of  the  registry,  such  enforcement  actions  were  funded  from  the  Commission’s  gen-
eral  appropriations.  DMA  does  not  believe  that  legitimate,  law-abiding  tele-
marketers  should  bear  the  burden  of  funding  enforcement  against  bad  actors.  This 
is not the case for other laws administered by the FTC. For example, Internet sites 
that  are  targeted  to  children,  which  are  subject  to  the  Children’s  Online  Privacy 
Protection Act, do not fund the Commission’s enforcement against entities that vio-
late  that  law.  We  are  very  supportive  of  increased  budgets  for  enforcement  by  the 
FTC  in  telemarketing,  as  well  as  other  areas  such  as  spam  and  identity  theft.  We 
believe,  however,  that  such  additional  funding  should  come  from  the  normal  FTC 
appropriations and not in fees collected from users of the registry. 
C.  The  Operator  of  the  Registry  Should  Improve  the  Hygiene  of  the  List  to  Ensure 

it does not Include Changed Telephone Numbers 

Finally, DMA would like to bring one additional issue regarding the ‘‘hygiene,’’ or 
accuracy, of the do-not-call registry to the Committee’s attention. We are told by our 

1 Telemarketing  Sales  Rule  User  Fees,  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking,  67  Fed.  Reg.  37362,  at 

37364 (May 29, 2002). 

2 Telemarketing  Sales  Rule  Fees,  Final  Rule,  68  Fed.  Reg.  45134,  at  45141  (July  31,  2003). 
3 Telemarketing  Sales  Rule  Fees,  Final  Rule,  69  Fed.  Reg.  45580,  at  45584  (July  30,  2004). 
4 Telemarketing  Sales  Rule  Fees,  Final  Rule,  70  Fed.  Reg.  43273,  at  43275  (July  27,  2005). 
5 Telemarketing Sales Rule Fees, Final Rule, 71 Fed. Reg. 43048 (July 31, 2006). 
6 While  DMA  no  longer  adds  new  names  to  the  TPS  list,  we  will  continue  to  operate  the  list 
for five more years. DMA, however, does continue to administer the state lists for Pennsylvania, 
Maine, and Wyoming.

members  that  30  percent  to  40  percent  of  the  telephone  numbers  on  the  registry 
are included incorrectly, such as dropped numbers, fax numbers, and wireless num-
bers.  We  believe  that  this,  in  part,  results  from  the  fact  that  there  is  a  significant 
time lag from when an individual moves and changes their telephone number to the 
time  when  that  number  is  removed  from  the  registry.  This  time  period  is  longer 
than  the  amount  of  time  it  takes  for  the  phone  company  to  reassign  the  number. 
As  a  result,  there  are  telephone  numbers  on  the  registry  for  households  that  did 
not register to be included on it. 

This  is  particularly  problematic  because  many  reassigned  telephone  numbers  are 
given  to  subscribers  who  recently  have  moved  to  new  geographic  regions  and  are, 
therefore, most likely to respond to telemarketing calls for items such as home secu-
rity  systems,  home  insurance,  lawn  care,  and  newspaper  delivery.  For  this  reason, 
DMA believes that telephone numbers should be removed from the registry as soon 
as  they  are  dropped  by  the  consumer  and  before  they  are  reassigned.  This  would 
make  for  a  much  more  accurate  list  recognizing  the  desires  of  consumers  and  pre-
serving the ability to call households that have not placed their numbers on the reg-
istry. We have raised this issue with the FTC and believe that they understand and 
appreciate  our  concern.  We  hope  that  this  concern  can  be  addressed  going  forward. 
III. Responsibilities of List Compilers 

The  Committee  has  asked  us  to  discuss  issues  related  to  list  compilers.  In  par-
ticular,  the  Committee  requested  testimony  on  this  issue  in  response  to  a  May  23, 
2007 letter that Senator McCaskill sent to the Chairman regarding a May 20, 2007 
New York Times article entitled ‘‘Bilking the Elderly, With a Corporate Assist.’’ We 
completely agree with the Senator’s concerns about the types of practices alleged in 
the article. 

DMA fully supports responsible practices by compilers of marketing lists, and has 
long  been  a  leader  in  establishing  comprehensive  self-regulatory  guidelines  for  its 
members on important issues related to telemarketing, among many others. Under-
standing the importance of standards and best practices in protecting consumer wel-
fare,  DMA,  in  June  2007,  working  with  its  members,  adopted  guidelines  for  data-
base  compilers  as  part  of  our  Guidelines  for  Ethical  Business  Practice  (‘‘Guide-
lines’’).7 

These  guidelines  were  developed  over  the  course  of  the  past  year  through  the 
DMA  process  for  guideline  establishment.  We  believe  that  these  guidelines  will  go 
a  long  way  to  prevent  illegitimate  marketing  practices  that  threaten  to  undermine 
relationships between consumers and marketers. In our experience, industry guide-
lines are the most effective way to address evolving marketing practices while being 
sensitive to consumer welfare. Such guidelines are flexible and adaptable in a timely 
manner  so  as  to  address  bad  practices  and  not  unintentionally  or  unnecessarily 
cover legitimate actors. 

In  her  letter,  Senator  McCaskill  expressed  concern  about  the  use  of  seniors’  per-
sonal  information  for  fraudulent  purposes  to  exploit  seniors  for  financial  gain.  We 
could not agree more with the Senator that seniors and other groups of individuals 
should  not  be  exploited  based  on  such  vulnerabilities.  Our  guidelines  have  always 
prohibited such conduct, and we believe that our list compiler guidelines directly ad-
dress concerns about seniors by further clarifying that such lists must only be used 
for appropriate purposes and defining new duties for list compilers. 

Specifically,  as  I  will  describe  in  more  detail  below,  these  guidelines  require  that 
for  sensitive  marketing  data,  which  includes  data  pertaining  to  children,  older 
adults,  health  care  or  treatment,  account  numbers,  or  financial  transactions,  com-
pilers  should  review  materials  to  be  used  in  promotions  to  help  ensure  that  their 
customers’  use  of  the  data  is  both  appropriate  and  in  accordance  with  their  stated 
purpose. 

This  list  compiler  guidelines  define  additional  appropriate  standards  for  compa-
nies  that  assemble  personally  identifiable  information  about  customers  for  the  pur-
pose of facilitating renting, selling, or exchanging information to non-affiliated third- 
party  organizations  for  marketing  purposes.  These  guidelines  require,  among  other 
things,  as  a  condition  of  DMA  membership,  that  companies  that  compile  and  sell 
marketing lists adhere to the following practices: 

• establish  contractual  agreements  with  customers  that  define  the  rights  and  re-
sponsibilities of the compiler and customer with respect to the use of marketing 
data;

Responsibilities of Database Compilers 
Article #36 

ATTACHMENT 

For  purposes  of  this  guideline,  a  database  compiler  is  a  company  that  assembles 
personally  identifiable  information  about  consumers  (with  whom  the  compiler  has 
no  direct  relationship)  for  the  purpose  of  facilitating  renting,  selling,  or  exchanging 
the  information  to  non-affiliated  third  party  organizations  for  marketing  purposes. 
Customer refers to those marketers that use the database compiler’s data. Consumer 
refers to the subject of the data. 

Database compilers should: 
• Establish  written  (or  electronic)  agreements  with  customers  that  define  the 
rights and responsibilities of the compiler and customer with respect to the use 
of marketing data. 
• Upon  a  consumer’s  request,  and  within  a  reasonable  time,  suppress  the  con-
sumer’s  information  from  the  compiler’s  and/or  the  applicable  customer’s  data-
base made available to customers for prospecting. 
• Not prohibit an end-user marketer from divulging the database compiler as the 
• At a minimum, explain to consumers, upon their request for source information, 
• Include language in their written (or electronic) agreements with DMA member 
customers  that  requires  compliance  with  applicable  laws  and  DMA  guidelines. 
For  non-DMA  member  customers  they  should  require  compliance  with  applica-
ble  laws  and  encourage  compliance  with  DMA’s  guidelines.  In  both  instances, 
customers should agree before using the marketing data.

source of the marketer’s information. 

• Require customers to state the purpose for which the data will be used. 
• Use marketing data only for marketing purposes. If the data are non-marketing 
data but are used for marketing purposes, they should be treated as marketing 
data for purposes of this guideline. 
• For  sensitive  marketing  data,  compilers  should  review  materials  to  be  used  in 
promotions  to  help  ensure  that  their  customers’  use  of  the  data  is  both  appro-
priate  and  in  accordance  with  their  stated  purpose.  Sensitive  marketing  data 
include  data  pertaining  to  children,  older  adults,  health  care  or  treatment,  ac-
count numbers, or financial transactions. 
• Randomly monitor, through seeding or other means, the use of their marketing 
databases  to  ensure  that  customers  use  them  in  accordance  with  their  stated 
purpose. 
• If  a  database  compiler  is  or  becomes  aware  that  a  customer  is  using  consumer 
data  in  a  way  that  violates  the  law  and/or  DMA’s  ethics  guidelines,  it  should 
contact  the  customer  and  require  compliance  for  any  continued  data  usage,  or 
refuse to sell the data and/or refer the matter to the DMA and/or a law enforce-
ment agency.

Ms. Holland? 
STATEMENT OF ROBIN HOLLAND, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, 

GLOBAL OPERATIONS, EQUIFAX INC. 

Ms. HOLLAND. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf 
of Equifax, and in support of the reform of the Credit Repair Orga-
nizations  Act,  or  CROA.  We  have  submitted  written  testimony  for 
the record, but I’d like to take a few minutes to highlight that testi-
mony. 

Let  me  first  say  a  quick  word  about  Equifax.  Equifax  is  the  old-
est,  the  largest,  and  the  only  domestically  publicly  traded  national 
credit bureau. Equifax is proud of its history, and proud of its serv-
ices, including its credit monitoring services. We are proud of these 
services,  because  they  have  proven  to  help  consumers  to  under-
stand  their  credit  score  and  their  credit  report,  to  better  manage 
their  use  of  credit,  and  to  help  consumers  guard  against  identity 
fraud. 

Let me emphasize at the outset that Equifax very much supports 
CROA  and  its  comprehensive  and  strict  regulation  of  credit  repair 
organizations. These organizations routinely make promises to con-
sumers  that  they  cannot  deliver  on.  They  tell  consumers  they  will 
help  them  to  improve  their  credit  score,  or  their  credit  report,  by 
removing adverse—but nonetheless, accurate and timely—informa-
tion from their reports. This is a deceptive and fraudulent, and ul-
timately  quite  incorrect,  representation,  and  the  victims  are  both 
the  consumers  and  the  national  credit  bureaus,  including  Equifax. 
Ironically,  however,  CROA  has  been  used  wrongly  and  inappro-
priately to attempt to punish consumer reporting agencies for offer-
ing credit monitoring products. Let me be very clear about the dif-
ference between credit monitoring products and so-called ‘‘credit re-
pair services.’’ 

Credit  monitoring  products—including  the  product  offered  by 
Equifax—allow  consumers  access  to  their  credit  reports  and  credit 
scores,  provide  proactive  notifications  of  changes  in  their  reports 
and  scores,  provide  an  explanation  of  scoring  algorithms,  and  pro-
vide consumers with a number of credit score-related tools. Simply 
stated,  monitoring  products  are  the  very  best  strategy  to  promote 
consumer financial literacy, and they are also consumers’ very best 
strategy to prevent and mitigate the cruel impact of identity theft. 
CROA’s  definition  of  a  credit  repair  service  is  so  broad,  that  it 
can  arguably,  but  wrongly,  be  interpreted  as  covering  any  of  these 
vital  credit  monitoring  services,  because  these  services,  directly  or 
indirectly, can be used to improve a consumer’s credit record, credit 
history, or credit score. 

CROA  defines  a  ‘‘credit  repair  organization’’  as  an  entity  which 
purports—directly  or  indirectly—to  help  consumers  improve  their 
credit  record.  For  this  reason,  Equifax  urges  the  Senate  to  enact 
legislation  to  make  absolutely  clear  that  credit  monitoring  is  not 
credit repair. 

The  FTC  has  expressed  the  same  sentiment—that  there  is  no 
basis  for  applying  CROA  to  credit  monitoring  services.  If  CROA 
were to be misapplied to credit monitoring services, it would mean 
that  consumers  would  be  unable  to  buy  these  services  on  a  sub-
scription basis; that consumers would receive notices and warnings

faced  with 

liability  that  could 

which  are  appropriate  for  consumers  faced  with  sales  pitches  for 
credit repair services, but entirely inappropriate—indeed, confusing 
and  deceptive—when  applied  to  credit  monitoring  service;  and  it 
would  mean  that  entities  offering  credit  monitoring  services  would 
potentially  be 
include  the 
disgorgement  of  all  monies  paid  by  all  persons  in  a  class  action 
suit, at least. Quite frankly, this would virtually drive credit moni-
toring services out of the marketplace. It is for this reason that we, 
very  much,  appreciate  this  Committee’s  interest  in  CROA  reform. 
We also appreciate efforts in the House, where bipartisan legisla-
tion  has  been  introduced  that  makes  clear  that  credit  monitoring 
activities  are  not  credit  repair  activities.  The  House  bill  also  pro-
vides  consumers  with  additional  protection,  including  a  very  de-
tailed  description  of  their  free  report  rights,  and  ID  fraud  protec-
tions under FACTA and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. And it fur-
ther  gives  the  consumer  the  ability  to  cancel  a  credit  monitoring 
contract with a right to a pro rata refund. 

This  is  a  time  when  concerns  about  identity  theft  are  at  an  all- 
time high, and when the need to improve consumers’ credit and fi-
nancial  literacy  has  never  been  greater.  This  is  the  time—now  is 
the time—to enact CROA reform. 

Thank you for the opportunity to testify, and I’d be happy to an-

swer any questions. 

[The prepared statement of Ms. Holland follows: 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBIN HOLLAND, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, 

GLOBAL OPERATIONS, EQUIFAX INC. 

Introduction 

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  am  Robin  Holland,  Senior  Vice 
President,  Global  Operations  for  Equifax.  I  want  to  thank  you  for  this  opportunity 
to  testify  regarding  the  Credit  Repair  Organizations  Act,  frequently  referred  to  as 
CROA. I commend your efforts, Mr. Chairman, the Members of the Committee and 
your excellent staff for taking up the long-overdue issue of CROA reform. 

In  this  statement,  I  briefly  describe  Equifax;  the  original  reasons  for  CROA’s  en-
actment;  the  credit  monitoring  products  that  Equifax  has  developed  since  the  pas-
sage of CROA to assist consumers to understand their credit histories and to protect 
their credit histories from fraud and identity theft; and the CROA reforms that, we 
believe, should be put into place to protect these vital credit monitoring services and 
to protect consumers. 
Equifax 

Founded  in  1899,  Equifax  is  the  oldest,  the  largest,  and  the  only  publicly  traded 
of  the  national  companies  that  provide  consumer  information  for  credit  and  other 
risk  assessment  decisions.  As  one  of  the  three  ‘‘national’’  credit  bureaus,  Equifax’s 
activities are highly regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and doz-
ens  of  other  related  Federal  and  state  statutes.  Equifax  is  a  responsible  steward  of 
sensitive consumer information and, as such, is committed to consumer privacy. We 
have  been  steadfast  in  working  with  governments,  consumers,  and  businesses  to 
forge effective solutions to complex information and privacy issues. Equifax believes 
that  the  marketplace  can  offer  solutions  that  enlighten,  enable  and  empower  con-
sumers.  Equifax  has  developed  products,  such  as  credit  monitoring  products,  which 
directly  assist  consumers  in  understanding  their  credit  files  and  in  empowering 
them to prevent identity theft and to manage their financial health. 
The Credit Repair Organizations Act (CROA) 

In  1996,  Congress  enacted  CROA  to  address  the  consumer  threat  posed  by  credit 
repair  organizations,  commercial  entities  which  charge  consumers  for  providing 
services  that  purportedly  would  improve  a  consumer’s  credit  record,  credit  history 
or  credit  rating.  In  our  view,  promising  to  alter  or  remove  negative,  but  accurate 
and  timely,  information  from  a  consumer’s  credit  report  constitutes  an  unfair  and 
deceptive practice that ultimately undermines consumer confidence in the credit re-

27 

porting system. In order to protect the integrity of the credit reporting system, con-
sumer  reporting  agencies,  including  Equifax  and  the  other  national  credit  bureaus, 
urged  Congress  to  enact  CROA  to  attempt  to  stop  these  entities  from  making  false 
promises  to  consumers  about  their  ability  to  change  or  alter  accurate  and  timely 
data  contained  in  credit  reports.  CROA  imposed  a  number  of  appropriately  harsh 
requirements  on  credit  repair  organizations,  including  consumer  disclosures  about 
the limits of any possible changes to a credit file. 

Thus,  CROA’s  intent  is  to  protect  consumers  from  paying  money  for  a  service 
which, almost by definition, cannot be provided and indirectly, at least, protect con-
sumer  reporting  agencies  and  legitimate  consumer  reporting  activities  from  the  de-
ceptive  and  fraudulent  actions  of  credit  repair  organizations.  Ironically,  by  crafting 
an  intentionally  broad  definition  of  ‘‘credit  repair  organization’’,  CROA’  s  definition 
of  a  credit  repair  organization  (any  entity  which,  directly  or  indirectly,  purports  to 
‘‘improve’’  a  consumer’s  credit  record)  has  bee  misread  to  cover  credit  monitoring 
products  offered  by  consumer  reporting  agencies—the  very  entities  that  originally 
sought passage of the legislation. 
Credit Monitoring 

Accurate  credit  reports  are  important  to  individual  consumers  and  to  the  econ-
omy.  Individual  consumers  who  fall  victim  to  identity  theft  can  be  denied  employ-
ment or credit and may be forced to expend significant resources correcting fraudu-
lent credit report information. Further, identity theft ends up costing financial insti-
tutions,  including  the  national  credit  bureaus,  well  in  excess  of  $1  billion  annually. 
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that consumers regularly review 
their credit report files to help guard against identity theft. 

As  public  awareness  and  concern  grows  over  the  risk  of  identity  theft,  the  na-
tional  credit  bureaus  have  developed  products  to  assist  consumers  to  monitor  their 
credit files and to detect and to prevent identity theft. 

The market for providing credit monitoring products is highly competitive in both 
product features and price. Credit monitoring products offered by the national credit 
bureaus are widely popular with consumers and recognized as a highly effective con-
sumer  protection  service  by  Federal  and  state  consumer  protection  agencies.  These 
products  give  consumers  a  first  line  of  defense  against  identity  theft,  and  are  rou-
tinely made available to victims of security breaches. Indeed, credit monitoring has 
become  a  staple  requirement  of  most  state  security  breach  notification  laws.  The 
FTC has explicitly endorsed credit monitoring as part of a consumer strategy to pro-
tect against identity theft. 

Equifax offers several credit monitoring products, including: 
• Equifax Credit Watch Silver: provides consumers with weekly credit monitoring 
of their Equifax credit file, one copy of their Equifax Credit ReportTM, and iden-
tity theft insurance in the amount of $2,500 per consumer, with a $250 deduct-
ible (not available to consumers in New York), to cover injuries arising from an 
occurrence of identity theft (subject to limitations and exclusions). 
• Equifax Credit Watch Gold: provides consumers with daily credit monitoring of 
their Equifax credit file, unlimited copies of their Equifax Credit ReportTM, and 
identity  theft  insurance  in  the  amount  of  $20,000  per  consumer  (not  available 
to consumers in New York) to cover injuries arising from an occurrence of iden-
tity theft (subject to limitations and exclusions). 
• Equifax  Credit  Watch  Gold  with  3-in-1  Monitoring:  provides  consumers  with 
daily credit monitoring of their Equifax, Experian and Trans Union credit files, 
unlimited copies of their Equifax Credit ReportTM, a 3-in-1 Credit Report which 
provides  consumers  with  their  credit  history  as  reported  by  the  three  major 
credit reporting agencies, and identity theft insurance in the amount of $20,000 
per consumer (not available to consumers in New York) to cover injuries arising 
from an occurrence of identity theft (subject to limitations and exclusions). 
• Score  WatchTM:  provides  consumers  with  continuous  monitoring  of  their  FICO® 
credit score and notification when a change in their FICO score impacts the in-
terest rate they are likely to receive, detailed explanations for key score changes 
and  specific  tips  for  understanding  their  score,  daily  credit  monitoring  of  their 
Equifax  credit  file,  and  two  free  Score  Power® (which  include  the  consumer’s 
Equifax Credit ReportTM and FICO credit score). 

The Need for CROA Reform 

CROA  was  enacted  before  any  of  these  recently  developed  positive  and  popular 
consumer education and credit file monitoring products were created. Unfortunately, 
a  broad  (and,  ultimately,  incorrect)  interpretation  of  CROA  could  include  consumer 
reporting agencies and their credit monitoring products under the definition of cred-

it  repair  organizations.  Inclusion  of  consumer  reporting  agencies  under  CROA  re-
strictions  would  inappropriately  restrict  and  complicate  consumer  access  to  credit 
file monitoring products and to the beneficial features offered by these products. 

Without CROA reform, plaintiffs’ class action suits threaten the viability of credit 
monitoring products. Under CROA, these suits could require the disgorgement of all 
revenues from the sale of the monitoring products. Several of the first wave of these 
kinds  of  lawsuits  has  been  settled,  but  this  kind  of  litigation  is  an  ongoing  threat 
and,  if  successful,  could  drive  credit  monitoring  products  from  the  marketplace  or, 
at the very least, adversely distort their pricing and delivery. 

CROA,  quite  rightly,  prohibits  the  collection  of  fees  before  completing  the  prom-
ised  service.  This  requirement  is  appropriate  for  credit  repair  organizations  but  in-
appropriate  for  credit  monitoring  products  which  customarily  are  sold  through  in-
stant online delivery and an annual subscription. 

Further,  CROA  requires  that  covered  entities  provide  prospective  consumer  sub-
scribers  with  notices  that  address  the  inability  of  credit  repair  organizations  to  re-
move adverse, but accurate, data from a credit report. Warnings against the decep-
tive  practices  of  credit  repair  organizations  would  be  confusing  and  inappropriate 
if given to a consumer seeking credit monitoring products. 

Further,  credit  repair  organizations  are  subject  to  a  number  of  appropriately 
harsh  and  specific  penalties,  including  a  requirement  to  disgorge  all  revenues  if 
CROA  is  violated.  These  penalties  are  not  appropriate  for  credit  monitoring  prod-
ucts. 
Proposed Legislation to Reform CROA 

Enforcement  authority  under  CROA  was  placed  with  the  Federal  Trade  Commis-
sion (FTC). The FTC staff states that it sees no basis for subjecting the sale of credit 
monitoring and similar educational products and services to CROA. 

As  you  know,  the  bipartisan  House  bill  (H.R.  2885)  being  offered  by  Representa-
tives  Paul  E.  Kanjorski  (D–PA)  and  Ed  Royce  (R–CA)  provides  that  an  entity  pro-
viding  legitimate  credit  monitoring  products,  and  not  credit  repair  services,  would 
not  fall  within  the  definition  of  a  credit  repair  organization  and,  therefore,  would 
not be subject to CROA. The bill would also provide for a complete and detailed no-
tice  to  be  sent  to  consumers  on  their  rights  under  the  Fair  Credit  Reporting  Act, 
including a right to a free report. 

In  addition,  the  House  bill  guarantees  subscribers  to  credit  monitoring  products 

a pro rata refund in the event that they cancel their service. 
Conclusion 

CROA  reform  is  straight-forward  and  narrowly  tailored  to  simply  effectuate  Con-
gress’ intent to apply CROA to credit repair organizations and not to other products 
and  services  that  did  not  even  exist  in  1996  and  which  benefit,  rather  than  harm, 
consumers. The fraudulent efforts of credit repair agencies harm consumers and the 
safety  and  soundness  of  the  credit  system.  The  objective  of  CROA  always  was  and 
is  to  target  companies  which  engage  in  fraudulent  practices  such  as  promising  to 
delete accurate information from a consumer’s credit report. 

CROA reform, as proposed in the House bill, does not provide a per se exemption 
from  CROA  for  consumer  reporting  agencies,  based  simply  on  their  status  as  con-
sumer  reporting  agencies.  Rather,  entities  are  exempt  from  CROA  only  if  they  do 
not  engage  in  credit  repair  activities.  Thus,  CROA  reform  does  not,  in  any  way, 
weaken  consumers’  protections  from  deceptive  practices  enforced  by  the  FTC  and 
State  Attorneys  General  which  address  the  activities  of  credit  repair  organizations 
or address unfair or deceptive practices involving credit repair services. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you.

Ms.  FAULKNER.  Good  afternoon,  Mr.  Chairman.  I’m  pleased  to 
have  the  opportunity  to  testify  this  afternoon  about  the  Credit  Re-
pair  Organizations  Act  for  the  National  Association  of  Consumer

Law Center, on behalf of its low-income clients, by U.S. PIRG, and 
by the Consumer Federation of America. 

Credit  repair  clinics  prey  on  consumers  with  false  promises  that 
they  can  remove  accurate  adverse  items,  such  as  bankruptcies, 
chargeoffs,  late  payments.  It  cannot  be  done.  Based  on  publicly 
available  information,  we  estimate  that  credit  repair  clinics  are 
submitting about 4 million meritless disputes per year to the credit 
bureaus. That means consumers are tossing money down the drain 
based  on  false  promises,  it  also  means  the  credit  bureaus  are  di-
verted  from  investigating  the  real  disputes,  such  as  identity  theft, 
or mixed files. 

The  credit  repair  scam  is  over  two  decades  old.  I  attach  to  my 
testimony  an  article  from  1988,  from  The  New  York  Times,  involv-
ing  a  scam  that  is  still  in  use  today,  and  that  is,  flooding  the  bu-
reaus with meritless disputes. 

The strong law that was enacted in 1996, the CROA, was subject 
to  the  credit  repair  clinics  immediately  looking  for  loopholes.  We 
have  recommended  eight  improvements  in  the  Act,  I’m  only  going 
to discuss three of them. 

The  first  loophole  is  in  the  Act  itself,  and  that  is,  the  Act  says 
you  cannot  charge  for  the  credit  repair  services,  until  they  have 
been fully performed. What the credit clinics are doing is breaking 
these  services  down  into  baby  steps,  so  that  they  will  charge  $75 
for  a  setup  file,  they  will  charge  $40  for  a  monthly  report—even 
though nothing has been done during that month. So, I think that 
the CROA needs to be changed to make it clear that the clinic can-
not charge for the repair services until the requested improvement 
has taken place. 

The  second  and  third  changes  we  need  are  external  to  the  stat-
ute,  so  that  consumers  can  enforce  the  law  better.  Like  other 
scams,  many  credit  repair  organizations  are  inserting  mandatory 
pre-dispute  arbitration  clauses  in  their  contracts.  That  means, 
whenever there’s wrongdoing, and the consumer wants to rectify it, 
it’s  swept  under  the  rug,  because  it’s  in  secret  proceedings  before 
some arbitration forum. 

The  other  thing  they’re  doing  is  imposing  distant  forum  clauses, 
which  means  that  a  consumer  from  Connecticut,  for  instance, 
would have to go to Washington State in order to enforce his or her 
rights.  Those  two  things  are  external  to  the  statute,  the  statute 
needs to be amended to protect consumers to limit those. 

Credit  monitoring  from  the  consumer  perspective  should  not  be 
exempt.  Credit  bureaus  already  have  the  grave  responsibility  to 
monitor credit reports, to make sure they are accurate, and to pre-
vent mixed files and identity theft. 

What credit monitoring services do is make the consumer pay for 
monitoring their own credit report, even though credit bureaus are 
supposed  to  be  doing  that  for  free.  We  think  credit  monitoring 
should  not  be  exempted,  because,  mainly  because  the  credit  repair 
clinics will find another loophole, as sure as can be. 

And  second,  in  my  testimony,  there  are  examples  of  the  Federal 
Trade Commission going after some of these credit monitoring serv-
ices  for  deceptive  practices.  No  one  should  be  exempt  from  the  de-
ceptive practices prohibited by CROA.

The credit reporting system is largely broken. And one of the rea-
sons  is  the  drain  on  consumer  resources,  and  on  credit  bureau  re-
sources, caused by these credit clinics. They must be stopped. 

We  urge  you  to  strengthen  the  laws  to  prevent  exploitation  of 

both consumers, and credit bureaus. Thank you. 

[The prepared statement of Ms. Faulkner follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOANNE S.  FAULKNER,  ATTORNEY ON BEHALF OF THE 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CONSUMER ADVOCATES,  NATIONAL CONSUMER LAW 
CENTER, U.S. PIRG, CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA 
Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens  and  other  distinguished  Members  of 
the  Commerce,  Science,  and  Transportation  Committee,  thank  you  for  inviting  me 
to  testify  today  in  this  important  hearing  to  consider  the  improvements  necessary 
for the effective implementation of the Credit Repair Organizations Act. I offer this 
testimony  today  on  behalf  of  the  National  Association  of  Consumer  Advocates,  the 
low income clients of the National Consumer Law Center, U.S. PIRG, and Consumer 
Federation  of  America.  We  oppose  changing  the  Act  to  protect  credit  monitoring 
services  since  the  proposed  changes  instead  facilitate  evasion  of  the  Act’s  salutary 
protections  by  credit  repair  organizations.  Instead,  we  offer  suggestions  for  improv-
ing the Act to strengthen its protections against deceptive credit repair services. 

I  am  Joanne  Faulkner,  a  founding  member  of  NACA.  A  brief  description  of  my 
background in consumer protection law, and a description of the consumer organiza-
tions named above, is appended. 

I  have  first  hand  experience  in  trying  to  enforce  the  Credit  Repair  Organizations 
Act,  15  U.S.C.  § 1679  et  seq.  (CROA).  Enforcing  the  CROA  is  frustrating,  not  be-
cause  of  what  has  been  enacted,  but  because  the  targets  of  the  law  have  devised 
methods  of  evasion.  While  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  has  enforcement  power, 
it  does  not  have  the  resources  to  address  the  burgeoning  and  emboldened  number 
of entities that prey on already financially overburdened consumers with false prom-
ises of credit repair. 

The  law  desperately  needs  to  be  strengthened  to  prevent  evasive  tactics.  If  Con-
gress considers watering down the Act by exempting credit monitoring services, the 
exemption will simply provide a roadmap that will be exploited by those seeking to 
avoid CROA’s protections against deceptive practices. 

In order to prevent evasion, and encourage private attorneys to effectively partici-
pate  in  stemming  the  abuses  and  dislocations  caused  by  credit  repair  entities,  the 
CROA should be strengthened. The Act needs: 

1. An express prohibition on pre-dispute arbitration clauses, commonly inserted 
by  credit  repair  organizations  (CROs)  both  to  insulate  them  from  liability  as 
well  as  to  keep  their  deceptive  practices  out  of  the  public  eye  and  under  the 
rug. 
2. A prohibition on distant forum clauses, commonly imposed by CROs to deter 
consumer enforcement of their rights under the CROA. 
3.  A  provision  affirmatively  allowing  the  consumer  to  sue  the  CRO  in  the  Fed-
eral or state judicial district where the consumer resides irrespective of any con-
tractual provision to the contrary. 
4. A provision that the consumer may obtain injunctive relief. 
5.  A  prohibition  on  any  contract  provision  that  prevents  class  actions,  particu-
larly  important  here  because  an  individual’s  damages  may  not  be  sufficient  to 
interest competent attorney representation. 
6. An amendment to § 1679b(4) of the CROA to effectuate the intent of Congress 
to  bar  unfair  and  deceptive  practices.  Because  the  word  ‘‘fraud’’  is  used  in  that 
subsection only, some courts are demanding a higher burden of proof and plead-
ing than normally imposed for unfair or deceptive practices. 
7. A provision preventing CROs from evading § 1679b(b) by charging for discrete 
services (‘‘set up file’’; ‘‘monthly report on progress’’ and the like). 
8.  Non-profits  should  not  be  exempt.  CROs  have  set  up  elaborate  structures 
whereby the consumer contracts with a non-profit ‘‘educational’’ entity but that 
entity  outsources  books  and  services  to  profit-making  friends,  relatives  and  as-
sociates. 

Moreover, as discussed below, we strongly oppose weakening the CROA by enact-
ing  the  deceptively  named  ‘‘Credit  Monitoring  Clarification  Act,’’  H.R.  2885,  which 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  08:10 Sep 17, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75784.TXT JACKIE

31 

is  virtually  identical  to  last  year’s  Senate  companion  bill,  S.  3662.  This  bill  would 
allow almost any business currently covered by CROA to escape the Act’s important 
protections.  Even  a  slight  change  in  description  from  promising  to  ‘‘improve  credit’’ 
to  providing  ‘‘access  to  credit  reports,  credit  monitoring  notifications,  credit  scores 
. . ., any analysis, evaluation or explanation of credit scores . . .’’ would mean that 
CROA’s  current  strict  prohibition  against  deception  would  no  longer  apply  to  enti-
ties abusing the consumer, deceiving the credit bureaus, and harming the economy. 
Abuses by the Credit Repair Industry continue and cry out for a stronger CROA 

Congress has found that ‘‘the banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate 
credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the bank-
ing  system,  and  unfair  credit  reporting  methods  undermine  the  public  confidence 
which  is  essential  to  the  continued  functioning  of  the  banking  system.’’  Fair  Credit 
Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(a). To further that purpose, Congress enacted the 
CROA, 15 U.S.C. § 1679, finding that ‘‘Certain advertising and business practices of 
some  companies  engaged  in  the  business  of  credit  repair  services  have  worked  a  fi-
nancial hardship upon consumers, particularly those of limited economic means and 
who are inexperienced in credit matters.’’ 15 U.S.C. § 1679(a)(2). The CROA was en-
acted  ‘‘to  protect  the  public  from  unfair  or  deceptive  advertising  and  business  prac-
tices by credit repair organizations.’’ § 1679(b)(2). 

‘‘As  Americans’  reliance  on  credit  has  increased,  so-called  ‘credit  repair  clinics’ 
have  emerged,  preying  on  individuals  desperate  to  improve  their  credit  records. 
These  organizations  typically  promise  they  can  have  any  negative  information  re-
moved permanently from any credit report . . . for a fee.’’ FTC v. Gill, 265 F.3d 944, 
947 (9th Cir. 2001) (sanctions against lawyer operating credit repair clinic in viola-
tion of CROA). Because of well-known abuses, thirty eight states have also enacted 
laws  restricting  credit  repair  operations,  including  my  state  of  Connecticut,  Conn. 
Gen. Stat § 36a–700. 

CROs  are  designed  to  undermine  accurate  credit  reporting.  Despite  the  CROA, 
the  CROs  have  established  elaborate  ruses  to  intentionally  profit  from  obtaining 
payment before credit repair services are fully performed. Some intentionally solicit 
consumers  on  the  representation  that  a  law  firm  is  involved,  and  that  consumers 
will  benefit  by  being  represented  by  a  law  firm.  CROs  intentionally  and  systemati-
cally deceive credit bureaus about the source and nature of the dispute correspond-
ence, and intentionally deceive consumers before and during the course of their rep-
resentation. 

The CROs’ volume of mailings to the credit bureaus causes harm to the credit re-
porting system because of the resources of bureau staff and time devoted to respond-
ing to the volume of letters generated by CROs, as well as the dislocation of bureau 
efforts  from  the  disputes  of  individuals  who  have  legitimate  accuracy  complaints, 
such  as  victims  of  identity  theft  or  of  mixed  files  (similar  names).  The  volume  and 
spurious nature of the disputes sent by CROs intentionally interferes with the credit 
bureaus’  business  of  providing  accurate  reports.  These  practices  ultimately  cause 
creditors to extend credit in reliance on credit bureau reports that are not accurate 
because  the  CROs’  dispute  volume  is  intended  to  force  bureaus  to  delete  tradelines 
that  they  cannot  investigate  within  thirty  days.  The  CROs’  systematic  deception  of 
the  credit  bureaus  and  of  consumers  undermines  the  banking  system  and  harms 
consumers  and  creditors  alike.  Appended  to  this  testimony  is  a  1988  New  York 
Times  article  recognizing  the  type  of  abusive  practices  that  are  still  taking  place 
today. 

Let  me  quote  from  the  testimony  of  Stuart  K.  Pratt,  President  of  the  Consumer 
Data Industry Association, before the House Committee on Financial Services (June 
19, 2007), showing credit repair is an ongoing and still significant problem: 

Historically credit repair operators would promise to delete accurate but neg-
ative  data  from  a  consumer’s  file  for  fees  that  in  some  cases  exceeded  $1,000. 
Their  primary  tactic  was  to  flood  the  reinvestigation  system  with  repeated  dis-
putes  of  the  same  negative  data  in  an  effort  to  ‘‘break’’  the  system  and  cause 
the data furnisher to both give up and not respond or to simply direct the con-
sumer  reporting  agency  to  delete  the  data.  Today,  operators  are  savvier  and 
often avoid making false promises but even now they suggest that they will as-
sist  the  consumer  with  disputing  inaccurate  or  unverifiable  information.  In 
many  cases  ‘‘unverifiable’’  equates  to  the  same  practice  of  flooding  the  system 
and trying to have accurate, predictive derogatory data removed. 

Our members estimate that on average across our members operating as na-
tionwide  consumer  reporting  agencies,  no  less  than  30  percent  of  disputes  filed 
are  tied  to  credit  repair.  Repetitive  disputes  can  be  particularly  harmful  to 
smaller data furnishers such as community banks, thrifts, credit unions and re-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  08:10 Sep 17, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75784.TXT JACKIE

32 

tailers.  These  data  sources  are  often  a  key  to  ensuring  full  and  complete  data 
on all credit-active consumers, but their ability to absorb costs is limited. In ex-
treme cases, small-business data sources may simply choose not to report at all 
if costs of responding to disputes are too high. 

Thankfully,  no  one  data  source  is  usually  the  target  of  a  credit  repair  oper-
ator  and  credit  repair  efforts  most  often  end  up  in  failure.  But  this  failure  is 
at a cost to our members and to consumers. Consumers spend money on a serv-
ice  that  cannot  deliver.  Industry  incurs  costs  as  well  when  it  has  to  dedicate 
resources  which  could  be  used  to  service  legitimate  disputes,  to  disputes  that 
are not likely to be valid. 

Thus, consumers and credit bureaus alike are eager to strengthen the CROA. 
The present credit reporting system is broken. Every analysis or study in this dec-
ade,  including  the  FACTA  authorized  FTC  Pilot  Study  has  found  inaccuracies  in  a 
significant  percentage  of  the  reports  considered.  The  CROs  are  one  cause  of  the  in-
accuracies. The amendments we suggest are essential to stop them, or at least pro-
vide a more effective means of deterring noncompliance than we have now. 
CROA has successfully deterred other deceptive credit services 

The CROA should not be watered down because it has also proved useful against 
entities  other  than  traditional  credit  repair  organizations  when  those  entities  have 
made  deceptive  claims  about  improvement  of  credit  history.  The  Act  has  been  held 
to apply to: 

• Credit counseling agencies that promise to improve participants’ credit ratings; 
• Debt collectors who offer improvement of the debtor’s credit rating in return for 
payment  of  the  debt  (even  when  the  effect  is  actually  to  worsen  the  credit  rat-
ing); 
• A  company  that  generated  subprime  auto  financing  leads  by  advertising  that 

it could restore consumers’ credit. 

Payday lenders have also operated under the guise of credit services organizations 

in order to evade state interest rate caps. 
Strengthen CROA By Adding Important Protections 

Rather than weakening the CROA, the Act should be strengthened to ensure that 

it will protect consumers from deceptive credit repair practices. 
1. Pre-dispute Arbitration Clauses must Be Prohibited 

Arbitration  clauses  are  commonly  inserted  in  contracts  by  credit  repair  organiza-
tions to insulate them from liability as well as to keep their deceptive practices out 
of  the  public  eye  and  under  the  rug.  One  court  mastered  this  issue,  Alexander  v. 
U.S. Credit Management, Inc., 384 F. Supp. 2d 1003, 1014 (N.D. Tex. 2005), but oth-
ers  have  endorsed  arbitration  clauses.  Congress  can  reduce  the  volume  of  litigation 
over  the  effectiveness  of  unilaterally  imposed  arbitration  clauses  by  prohibiting 
them in the CROA. 

Mandatory  pre-dispute  arbitration  clauses  unilaterally  imposed  by  creditors  and 
scam  artists  alike  cause  significant  harm  to  consumers,  deter  and  indeed  eliminate 
effective  enforcement  and  keep  corporate  wrongdoing  under  the  rug  and  out  of  the 
public’s scrutiny. 

Although  arbitration  can  be  a  fair  and  efficient  way  to  resolve  a  dispute  when 
both  parties  choose  it  after  the  dispute  arises,  arbitration  is  particularly  hostile  to 
individuals  attempting  to  assert  their  rights.  High  administrative  fees,  and  a  lack 
of  discovery  proceedings,  jury  trials  and  other  civil  due  process  protections,  and 
meaningful judicial review of arbitrators’ decisions all act as barriers to the fair and 
just  resolution  of  an  individual’s  claim.  When  arbitration  is  required  rather  than 
voluntarily  chosen,  the  likelihood  that  these  problems  will  occur  and  that  arbitra-
tors will favor repeat corporate players over individual claimants is increased. 
2. Distant Forum Clauses must Be Prohibited 

CROs commonly include a clause in their contracts requiring that any suit or ar-
bitration  be  brought  in  some  location  distant  from  the  consumer  and  expensive  to 
travel  to.  Plainly,  this  type  of  provision  effectively  precludes  any  effort  to  enforce 
the CROA. ‘‘Distant forum abuse is ‘unconscionable’ and ‘insidious’ conduct employ-
ing  ‘an  ostensibly  legitimate  legal  process  to  deprive  consumers  of  basic  opportuni-
ties  which  should  be  afforded  all  litigants.’ ’’  Yu  v.  Signet  Bank/Virginia,  69  Cal. 
App.  4th  1377,  1389  (1999)  (citations  omitted).  ‘‘[M]isuse  of  the  courts  in  this  man-
ner  contributes  to  an  undermining  of  confidence  in  the  judiciary  by  reinforcing  the

ber  stamp’  for  the  improper  practices  utilized  by  predatory  agencies.’’  Barquis  v. 
Merchants  Collection  Assn.,  7  Cal.  3d  94,  108,  101  Cal.  Rptr.  745,  496  P.2d  817 
(1972)  (filing  in  a  distant  venue  for  the  ulterior  purpose  of  impairing  consumer’s 
rights  to  defend  the  suits  to  coerce  inequitable  settlements  or  default  judgments  is 
abuse of process). 

In  Spiegel,  Inc.  v.  FTC,  540  F.2d  287  (7th  Cir.  1976),  the  practice  of  filing  collec-
tion  lawsuits  in  distant  forums  was  held  unfair  and  unconscionable.  This  practice 
has been attacked successfully in both private and public enforcement actions. E.g., 
Schubach  v.  Household  Finance  Corporation,  376  N.E.2d  140,  141–142  (Sup.  Jud. 
Ct. Mass. 1978) (practice unfair or deceptive even when permitted by venue statute); 
Celebrezze v. United Research, Inc., 482 N.E.2d 1260, 1262 (Ohio App. 1984); Zanni 
v.  Lippold,  119  F.R.D.  32  (C.D.  Ill.  1988)  (class  composed  of  defendants  subject  to 
distant forum abuse certified). 

The CRO should not be allowed to sue the consumer in a distant forum. The con-

sumer should not be required to sue the CRO in a distant forum. 
3. Venue must Be Local 

Lack  of  a  venue  provision  is  one  obvious  gap  in  the  provisions  of  the  CROA. 
Venue is the locale where the consumer can sue or be sued. The CROA should have 
an affirmative provision, like other subtitles of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 
placing  the  location  of  lawsuits  at  the  consumer’s  residence,  such  as:  ‘‘An  action  to 
enforce any liability credited by this subchapter may be brought in any appropriate 
United States District Court without regard to the amount in controversy, or in any 
other  court  of  competent  jurisdiction,  located  in  the  judicial  district  or  similar  legal 
entity in which the consumer resides at the commencement of the action.’’ 
4. Injunctive Relief Is Essential 

The  CROA  allows  States  and  the  FTC  to  obtain  injunctive  relief.  By  omission, 
there  may  be  an  implication  that  United  States  District  Courts  do  not  retain  their 
normal injunctive power in individual CROA cases. While it is likely that Congress 
did  not  intend  to  so  divest  Federal  courts  of  their  injunctive  powers,  any  judicial 
confusion  can  be  corrected  with  a  short  addition  to  the  statute  expressly  acknowl-
edging such a remedy. This would provide a faster and less burdensome remedy for 
consumers  and  facilitate  their  ‘‘private  attorneys  general’’  in  obtaining  effective  re-
lief. 
5. Class Action Waivers Should Be Explicitly Disallowed 

Another  way  the  CROs  reduce  their  exposure  to  wrongdoing  is  by  inserting  a 
clause prohibiting class actions, or prohibiting the individual consumer from partici-
pating in a class action against the CRO. The CROA allows class actions; it should 
also  override  any  effort  by  the  CRO  to  undermine  this  salutary  provision  by  at-
tempting to preclude class litigation. 

The Supreme Court has long recognized that without class actions, claimants with 
small claims would not be able to obtain relief. See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 
472  U.S.  797  (1985).  ‘‘Class  actions  . . .  may  permit  the  plaintiffs  to  pool  claims 
which  would  be  uneconomical  to  litigate  individually.  For  example,  this  lawsuit  in-
volves  claims  averaging  about  $100  per  plaintiff;  most  of  the  plaintiffs  would  have 
no  realistic  day  in  court  if  a  class  action  were  not  available.’’  Id.  at  809.  The  1966 
Advisory  Committee  Notes  to  Rule  23  echo  this  concern:  ‘‘These  interests  [in  indi-
vidual  litigation]  may  be  theoretical  rather  than  practical:  . . .  the  amounts  at 
stake  for  individuals  may  be  so  small  that  separate  suits  would  be  impracticable.’’ 
Similarly, the leading treatise on class actions has stated: 

The  desirability  of  providing  recourse  for  the  injured  consumer  who  would 
otherwise  be  financially  incapable  of  bringing  suit  and  the  deterrent  value  of 
class  litigation  clearly  render  the  class  action  a  viable  and  important  mecha-
nism in challenging fraud on the public. 

Newberg,  Class  Actions  at  § 21.30.  See  also  Watkins  v.  Simmons  and  Clark,  Inc. 
618  F.  2d  398,  404  (6th  Cir.  1980)  (class  action  certifications  to  enforce  compliance 
with consumer protection laws are ‘‘desirable and should be encouraged.’’) 
6. The Word ‘‘Fraud’’ Should Be Deleted from § 1679b(4) 

The CROA is a broadly worded enactment, a uniquely potent consumer protection 
statute  that  both  provides  for  punitive  damages  and  voids  the  violative  contract. 
The  type  of  intentional  conduct  required  by  a  fraud  standard  is  taken  into  account 
only in determining the amount of punitive damages. Yet, courts unfortunately have 
been drawn by the word ‘‘fraud’’ in § 1679b(4) to impose a higher burden of pleading 
and proof on the consumer.

34 

What  Congress  actually  said,  and  notably  the  only  place  the  word  ‘‘fraud’’  was 
used,  does  not  require  a  CROA  plaintiff  to  exclusively  plead  fraud;  the  plain  lan-
guage encompasses fraud, but is much broader than that: 

(4)  engage,  directly  or  indirectly,  in  any  act,  practice,  or  course  of  business 
that  constitutes  or  results  in  the  commission  of,  or  an  attempt  to  commit,  a 
fraud or deception on any person in connection with the offer or sale of the serv-
ices of the credit repair organization. 

The legislative history shows that the section was meant to prohibit deceptive and 
unfair practices, even if they do not amount to fraud.1 The subsection should be re-
worded to clarify that intent. We suggest the following: 

(4)  engage,  directly  or  indirectly,  in  any  act,  practice,  or  course  of  business 
that INVOLVES ANY FALSE, DECEPTIVE OR MISLEADING REPRESENTA-
TION  OR  MEANS  constitutes or results in the commission of, or an attempt 
to commit, a fraud or deception on any person in  connection  with  the  offer  or 
sale of the services of the credit repair organization. 

7. Close the ‘‘services’’ loophole 

CROs  contract  to  perform  credit  repair.  However,  in  order  to  evade  the  statutory 
prohibition  on  charging  before  services  are  rendered,  they  break  services  down  into 
each step. They separately charge a set-up fee (setting up the file is a ‘‘service’’) and 
a  monthly  report  fee  (mindlessly  transmitted  by  computer).  Another  charge  is  de-
scribed  as  for  ‘‘time  and  expense  for  commencing  the  representation  of  the  client.’’ 
There is a ‘‘rush fee’’ for expedited services. This breakout of each small step in the 
ultimate service should be prohibited. No money should change hands, in escrow or 
otherwise,  until  the  credit  repair  itself  is  actually  performed.  We  request  the  fol-
lowing amendment. 

1679b(b)  Payment  in  advance.—No  credit  repair  organization  may  charge  or 
receive  any  money  or  other  valuable  consideration  for  the  performance  of  any 
service FOR THE EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PURPOSE OF IMPROVEMENT IN 
ANY CONSUMER’S CREDIT RECORD, CREDIT HISTORY OR CREDIT RAT-
ING  which  the  credit  repair  organization  has  agreed  to  perform  for  any  con-
sumer before such service IMPROVEMENT is fully performed. 

8. Non-Profits Should Not Be Exempt 

The FTC has sued ‘‘educational’’ entities that have nonprofit status but are struc-
tured  so  that  founders  and  their  family  and  friends  have  high-price  contracts  for 
goods or services sold to the nonprofit. Section 1679a should be amended to at least 
add a qualifying phrase, ‘‘and is not for its own profit or that of any person directly 
or  indirectly  associated  with  the  organization.’’  The  change  would  endorse  the 
thoughtful  interpretation  limiting  the  section’s  exemption  to  true  nonprofits  by  the 
First  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  in  Zimmerman  v.  Cambridge  Credit  Counseling 
Corp., 409 F.3d 473 (1st Cir. 2005). 
Deceptive Credit Monitoring Services 

Although  the  national  credit  bureaus  are  victims  of  many  credit  repair  scams, 
they  themselves  have  also  engaged  in  deceptive  practices.  The  national  credit  bu-
reaus  have  developed  another  new  and  lucrative  profit  center  based  on  consumer 
fear of inaccuracies in credit reports. Each agency markets a credit-monitoring prod-
uct  directly  to  consumers.  As  the  agency  reported  to  its  shareholders  on  May  23, 
2007: 

Consumer  Direct  [online  credit  reports,  scores  and  monitoring  Services]  deliv-
ered  excellent  growth  throughout  the  period,  with  strong  demand  from  con-
sumers for credit monitoring services, which led to higher membership rates. 

58. 

1 Section 404, as described in H.R. Rep. 104–486, 103d Cong. 2d Sess., 1994 WL 164513 *57– 

Section 404 prohibits credit repair organizations from (1) making untrue or misleading state-
ments or advising consumers to make such statements with respect to a consumer’s credit wor-
thiness, credit standing, or credit capacity to a consumer reporting agency or to a person extend-
ing  credit  to  the  consumer;  (2)  making  statements  or  advising  consumers  to  make  statements 
to  consumer  reporting  agencies  or  a  person  extending  credit  to  the  consumer  that  are  intended 
to  alter  the  consumer’s  identification  to  prevent  the  display  of  adverse  credit  information  that 
is  accurate  and  not  obsolete;  (3)  making  or  using  untrue  or  misleading  representations  of  the 
services the credit repair organization can provide; (4) engaging in deceptive acts; and (5) charg-
ing or receiving payment in advance of fully performing services for the consumer.

In  its  most  recent  quarterly  filing,  the  agency  reported  that  its  sale  of  these  re-
ports and its credit monitoring products directly to consumers had generated no less 
than  10  percent  of  its  operating  revenue  and  one-sixth  of  its  credit  reporting  rev-
enue. 

Whether  or  not  their  credit  monitoring  services  offer  any  benefit  to  consumers, 
these  services  have  been  marketed  in  a  deceptive  way  to  induce  consumers  to  pay 
for  reports  they  are  legally  entitled  to  receive  for  free,  and  for  fraud  monitoring 
services  that  the  CRAs  are  already  legally  obligated  to  perform.  For  example, 
Experian has branded and marketed its misnamed service www.freecreditreport.com. 
Concerns over these services must be kept in mind because the CRAs are pushing 

for an exemption from CROA. We strongly oppose such an exemption. 

Experian  has  been  penalized  twice  by  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  for  decep-
tively linking subscription-based credit monitoring offers to the Federal free annual 
credit  report  on  request  right  established  by  the  2003  FACT  Act.  In  August  2005, 
Consumerinfo.com paid $950,000 to settle charges by the FTC that Experian offered 
consumers  a  free  copy  of  their  credit  report  and  ‘‘30  FREE  days  of  Credit  Check 
Monitoring’’  without  adequately  explaining  that  after  the  free  trial  period  for  the 
credit-monitoring  service  expired,  consumers  automatically  would  be  charged  a 
$79.95  annual  membership  unless  they  notified  the  defendant  within  30  days  to 
cancel  the  service.  Consumerinfo.com  billed  the  credit  cards  that  it  had  told  con-
sumers were ‘‘required only to establish your account’’ and, in some cases, automati-
cally  renewed  memberships  by  re-billing  consumers  without  notice.  The  settlement 
required  Consumerinfo  to  pay  redress  to  deceived  consumers,  barred  deceptive  and 
misleading claims about ‘‘free’’ offers, and required clear and conspicuous disclosure 
of terms and conditions of any ‘‘free’’ offer. 

Experian  then  violated  this  settlement  agreement,  and  in  February  2007  was 
fined a second time by the FTC for $300,000 to settle charges that its ads for a ‘‘free 
credit report’’ continued to fail to disclose adequately that consumers who signed up 
would be automatically enrolled in a credit-monitoring program and charged $79.95. 
Although  Consumerinfo.com  now  contains  the  disclosures,  they  are  in  fine  print, 
and the website implies that the truly free report is not ‘‘user-friendly’’ like the free 
one that comes with the monitoring service. 

Moreover, the main Equifax, TransUnion and Experian websites all are worse. All 
prominently  mention  free  credit  reports  with  links  that  lead  to  a  sign  up  for  their 
paid  monitoring  service.  Although  they  each  have  disclosures  somewhere  about  the 
price  and  the  distinction  between  the  truly  free  report,  they  are  obscure  and  easy 
to  overlook.  All  three  websites  make  it  very  difficult  to  learn  about  how  to  get  a 
truly free report, and very easy to respond to a prominent ‘‘get my free report’’ link 
and inadvertently sign up for a paid services. 

Beyond  the  free  report,  it  is  not  clear  what  these  credit  monitoring  services  offer 
beyond the CRA’s existing legal duties. The bureaus have been charged by Congress 
with  maintaining  ‘‘maximum  possible  accuracy’’  in  consumers’  credit  reports.  Yet, 
their  credit  monitoring  services  ask  the  consumer  to  pay  to  review  the  accuracy  of 
their  credit  files.  The  bureaus  should  be  preventing  identity  theft,  mixed  files,  and 
other errors on their own and without charging the consumer for so doing. 
Resist Efforts to Weaken CROA 

The  variety  of  forms  that  deception  can  take,  the  creativity  of  those  who  would 
exploit consumer’s concern for their credit rating, and the variety of actors involved, 
are  all  a  strong  warning  against  creating  any  loopholes  in  CROA’s  protections 
against  deceptive  practices.  I  have  seen  a  draft  of  a  proposal  whose  short  title  is 
the ‘‘Credit Monitoring Clarification Act,’’ (H.R. 2885). NACA, NCLC and U.S. PIRG 
and other consumer organizations oppose the bill. The line between an offer to help 
ensure that credit reports ‘‘are accurate and free of fraud,’’ as on Equifax’s website, 
and offers to improve a credit report or credit score, covered by CROA, is a fine one. 
We  believe  that  credit  monitoring  services  should  comply  with  CROA’s  protections 
against deception just like other credit repair services. 

Unfortunately,  H.R.  2885  opens  wide,  wide  loopholes  for  CROs  as  well.  The  pro-
posed  amendment  to  CROA  for  credit  monitoring  activities  includes  broad  and 
sweeping  exemptions.  Anyone  who  characterizes  their  services  as  providing  ‘‘access 
to  credit  reports,  credit  monitoring  notifications,  credit  scores  . . .,  any  analysis, 
evaluation  or  explanation  of  credit  scores 
. . .’’  would  be  exempted  from  coverage 
under  CROA  as  long  as  they  provide  a  new  disclosure  and  cancellation  rights  for 
credit  monitoring  services.  In  fact,  the  business  would  remain  exempt  even  if  it  of-
fered  to  improve  credit  scores  or  modify  credit  reports,  as  long  as  the  offer  did  not 
promise to remove accurate items that are not obsolete. 

Yet as Stuart Pratt of the Consumer Data Industry Association noted in the testi-
mony  quoted  above,  ‘‘Today,  operators  are  savvier  and  often  avoid  making  false 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  08:10 Sep 17, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75784.TXT JACKIE

36 

promises  but  even  now  they  suggest  that  they  will  assist  the  consumer  with  dis-
puting  inaccurate  or  unverifiable  information.  In  many  cases  ‘unverifiable’  equates 
to  the  same  practice  of  flooding  the  system  and  trying  to  have  accurate,  predictive 
derogatory data removed.’’ 

In other words, any business that is currently defined to be a credit repair organi-
zation under CROA could simply escape the coverage of CROA by slightly changing 
the  description  of  what  they  do  and  offering,  for  example,  to  provide  analyses  and 
projections  of  a  person’s  credit  score.  CROA’s  current  strict  prohibition  against  de-
ception and fraud would no longer apply to that business. 

Below  are  some  examples  of  the  consumer  protections  in  the  current  law  that 

would not be available under H.R. 2885. 

• When  run-of-the-mill  credit  repair  businesses  deceptively  advertise  their  ability 
to  improve  consumers’  credit  scores  by  exaggerating  what  they  can  accomplish, 
CROA offers protections against this deception. 

• When  debt  collectors  collect  debts  by  deceptively  promising  improvement  of  a 
consumer’s  credit  rating,  CROA’s  prohibition  against  deception  can  be  brought 
to bear. 

• Some payday lenders are now advertising themselves as credit repair specialists 
to  evade  state  restrictions  on  interest  rates;  activities  to  which  CROA’s  protec-
tions clearly apply. 

Moreover, credit monitoring services—which themselves have been marketed in a 
deceptive  manner—would  be  completely  exempt  from  CROA’s  prohibition  against 
untruthful  or  deceptive  practices.  In  fact,  it  is  not  even  clear  that  the  CRA’s  need 
an  exemption  from  CROA.  See  Hillis  v.  Equifax  Consumer  Servs.,  237  F.R.D.  491, 
515 (D. Ga. 2006) (discussing why credit monitoring services do not seem to be with-
in  CROA,  but  stating  ‘‘if  a  credit  reporting  firm  decides  to  offer  a  service  that  falls 
within  the  purview  of  the  CROA,  there  is  no  reason  that  the  CROA  should  not 
apply’’).

NEED CREDIT? BE WARY OF CLINICS OFFERING HELP 

By Leonard Sloane 

It  was  the  most  extreme  case  of  credit-repair  abuse  ever  uncovered:  9,000  people 
around  the  Nation  defrauded  of  about  $2  million  they  had  paid  Credit-Rite  Inc.  to 
restore  their  eligibility  for  various  forms  of  credit.  Two  of  the  operators  of  Credit- 
Rite,  a  New  Jersey  concern,  were  sentenced  to  prison  terms  this  week  in  Federal 
District Court in Trenton, and the third received a suspended sentence. 

Credit-repair  clinics  are  profit-making  ventures  that,  by  their  very  nature,  often 
operate at the edge of the law, thwarting the maintenance of orderly credit records 
in behalf of clients who have bad credit histories. 

The clinics promise to help remove derogatory information from individuals’ credit 
files, and charge as much as $2,000 for the service. They take advantage of a provi-
sion  of  the  Fair  Credit  Reporting  Act  that  gives  consumers  the  right  to  challenge 
the information about them that credit bureaus have on file. This provision requires 
a  credit  bureau  to  verify  the  information  upon  request,  generally  within  30  days. 
If verification is not completed on time, the disputed data must be deleted. 
Company Guaranteed Results 

Charlie  Mae  McCray  of  Cleveland  testified  at  the  Credit-Rite  trial  that  she  had 
paid  more  than  $500  to  clear  up  her  credit  record.  The  company  had  guaranteed 
results,  but  nothing  was  done.  ‘‘I  complained,  I  wrote  letters,  but  I  didn’t  get  any 
response to my satisfaction,’’ she said. ‘‘I still haven’t received any money back.’’ 

Anne C. Singer, the Assistant United States Attorney in New Jersey who handled 
the  Credit-Rite  case,  said:  ‘‘It’s  impossible  to  perform  this  service  as  promised  if 
someone’s credit history is correct. The people involved in running these businesses 
raise  the  hopes  of  low-  and  moderate-income  people,  and  then  their  hopes  are 
dashed.’’ 

In another credit-repair clinic case this week in Los Angeles, the operator of Wise 
Credit Counselors was convicted and sentenced to probation and community service 
by a Municipal Court judge, who also ordered full restitution to the 13 victims.

Corrections Without Fees 

37 

Individuals  who  feel  their  credit  records  have  inaccuracies  can  go  directly  to  a 
local  credit  bureau  and  ask  that  they  be  corrected.  There  are  also  nonprofit  credit 
counseling  services  around  the  country  that  will  help  consumers  develop  workable 
budgets and pay off their bills. 

Many credit-repair clinics also promise to obtain credit cards for people who have 
been refused by card issuers. There are about 30 million such people in the United 
States,  cutoff  from  such  basic  transactions  as  renting  a  car  or  making  travel  res-
ervations  because  they  do  not  have  a  card.  Cards  provided  through  credit-repair 
clinics  are  usually  secured  by  a  deposit  made  by  the  card  holder  in  the  bank  that 
issues the card. 

But  some  banks  offer  secured  cards  directly  to  consumers  without  charging  the 
hundreds  of  dollars  in  application  and  membership  fees  exacted  by  many  credit-re-
pair clinics. Beyond that, only 4 out of every 10 applicants who pay fees for secured 
cards  eventually  get  cards,  according  to  H.  Spencer  Nilson,  the  publisher  of  the 
Nilson Report, a credit-card newsletter in Los Angeles. 

But the blizzard of challenges to credit bureaus is the essential operating method 

of credit-repair clinics. 

‘‘The objective is to overwhelm the established system,’’ said Walter R. Kurth, the 

president of Associated Credit Bureaus, a trade association. 

Credit-repair  operators  do  not  necessarily  disagree.  ‘‘The  credit  bureaus  have  ex-
ercised  too  much  power,’’  said  Paul  Turk,  general  manager  of  City  Wide  Financial 
Services, a clinic in Los Angeles. 

TRW Information Services, a credit-bureau chain based in Orange, Calif., refuses 
to  do  business  with  credit  clinics.  ‘‘We  have  a  procedure  in  place  when  we  feel  con-
sumers  have  been  involved  with  a  credit  clinic,  whereby  we  notify  them  we  don’t 
deal  with  third-party  contacts,’’  said  Delia  Fernandez,  a  spokeswoman.  This  policy 
is  being  contested  in  a  lawsuit  by  the  American  Association  of  Credit,  a  Glendale, 
Calif.,  clinic.  The  case  is  pending.  Equifax  Inc.,  which  owns  a  chain  of  credit  bu-
reaus,  also  makes  ‘‘every  effort  to  circumvent  dealing  with  clinics,’’  said  Annette 
Aurrecoecher,  a  vice  president  of  the  Atlanta  company.  ‘‘But  if  a  clinic  has  a  nota-
rized letter from a consumer, we feel there is an obligation to deal with it.’’ 
‘Fly-by-night’ Companies 

Bills were proposed in both houses of Congress early last year to restrict the prac-
tices of credit-repair clinics, but no hearings have been scheduled. Seventeen states 
have passed laws regulating the clinics’ advertising and business practices, yet resi-
dents of those states are often solicited by clinics in nearby states. 

‘‘We  continue  to  be  very  concerned,’’  said  Kathleen  V.  Buffon,  the  Federal  Trade 
Commission’s assistant director of credit practices. ‘‘These companies tend to be fly- 
by-night.’’ 

Whether  or  not  consumers  use  a  credit-repair  clinic,  information  that  has  been 
correctly  recorded  in  a  credit  bureau  file  cannot  be  permanently  removed  until  the 
problem is corrected or until the time provided by law has elapsed. 

‘‘The  only  way  to  acquire  a  good  credit  record  is  to  straighten  up  your  act,’’  said 
Jeanne Hogarth, an assistant professor of consumer economics and housing at Cor-
nell University. ‘‘There is no magic wand that these repair clinics can raise.’’

ticular  scams  and  schemes  of  the  day.  It’s  been  something  of  an

themes, in an effort—a continuing effort—to avoid being brought to 
justice. 

Now,  about  15  years  ago,  the  Iowa  Attorney  General’s  office  de-
veloped  some  very  effective  techniques  for  capturing  on  tape  some 
of the fraudulent pitches that were being directed at various elder-
ly  citizens  of  our  State,  and  those  pitches  were  typically  being— 
emanating  from  other  States—Iowa  generally  supplies  the  victims, 
and  other  States  have—used  to  supply—the  telemarketers  that 
would harvest the Iowa victims. 

But,  things  have  changed,  and  since  then  the  predatory  tele-
marketers  have  moved  across  international  boundaries.  So—where 
before  we  could  capture  pitches  on  tape,  and  use  those  tapes  to 
charge,  extradite,  prosecute,  and  very  seriously  deter  the  tele-
marketers—fraudulent  telemarketers  that  were  calling  from  other 
States,  now  we’ve  been  dealing  with  international  boundaries,  and 
the  challenges  in  dealing  with  international  boundaries  by  State 
law enforcement, in terms of investigation and prosecution are pro-
nounced, to say the least. 

So,  increasingly,  we  tried  to  focus  our  attention  on  the  stable, 
U.S.-based operations that provide something of a platform—or the 
necessary  infrastructure  for  the  telemarketers  to  operate.  The 
thinking  is  that  by  making  the  facilitators  answer  for  the  frauds 
to  which  they  provide  support,  they  will  withdraw  that  support— 
in part or in whole—from the dubious operators, and thus make it 
more difficult for the perpetrators to complete their frauds, to claim 
their victims. 

So,  attention  has  been  directed,  for  example,  to  banks  and  to 
third-party  processors  that  provide  the  means  through  which  the 
fraudulent  telemarketers  can  extract  money  from  the  accounts  of 
victims.  And,  attention  has  also  been  paid  to  the  list  builders,  list 
brokers,  list  managers  that—in  effect—help  scammers  to  identify 
elderly  Americans  who  would  be  especially  vulnerable  to  being 
cheated by a stranger over the phone. 

List  building—list  builders,  are  operations  that  actually  create 
lists  of  people  vulnerable  to  being  scammed.  And,  they  may  do  it 
by  sending  prospecting  mailings,  screening  mailings,  to  tens—or 
hundreds  of  thousands—of  individuals,  and  they  uniformly,  in  our 
experience,  these  mailings  promote  vague  and  misleading  opportu-
nities to win prizes, sweepstakes, and the like. 

So, the prize-oriented mailings ask the consumer to send back to 
the mailer, a small check—it might be $20 or so, as an administra-
tive  fee,  or  an  acquisition  fee,  a  transfer  fee—often  a  fee  they  des-
ignate in such a way as to suggest that you’re paying for processing 
the prize. 

The  people  who  send  a  check  in  response  to  such  mailings  are 
prime  candidates  for  further  victimization,  which  is  the  whole 
point.  They’re  typically  older,  and  they’ve  demonstrated  a  willing-
ness  to  send  money  to  a  stranger  in  a  distant  place  in  response  to 
vague  representations  regarding  a  sweepstakes  or  a  prize—that  is 
the ideal profile, for a fraudulent telemarketer to pursue.

List-building  mailings  often  ask  for  information  just  to  enhance 
the value of the list in the wrong hands—information such as tele-
phone numbers and credit card numbers. 

And—I  see  my  time  is  out,  so  I’ll  conclude  my  remarks.  We’ve 
continued  to  focus  our  attention,  as  much  as  possible,  as  has  the 
FTC, on these facilitating structures, and we’ll take any questions. 
Thank you. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. St. Clair follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF STEVE ST. CLAIR, ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, 

STATE OF IOWA 

Fraudulent telemarketers have been stealing from Americans, particularly elderly 
Americans, for many years. That much is constant. But techniques and operational 
details  have  changed  over  time.  It’s  been  an  arms  race  with  the  authorities.  Law 
enforcement  develops  techniques  for  catching  the  scammers,  and  they  in  turn  de-
velop new ways to work the scams and avoid being caught. 

About  15  years  ago  the  Iowa  Attorney  General’s  Office  developed  an  effective 
method  for  capturing  fraudulent  phone  pitches  on  tape  and  criminally  prosecuting 
the  telemarketers,  who  were  typically  calling  Iowans  from  another  state.  But  since 
then, the predatory telemarketers have moved their operations across international 
boundaries—to Canada, Costa Rica, and elsewhere—which makes investigation and 
prosecution by state authorities extremely challenging. 

So  increasingly  we’ve  focused  our  attention  on  the  stable,  U.S.-based  operations 
that  facilitate  the  telemarketing  scams.  The  thinking  is  that  by  making  the 
facilitators  answer  for  the  frauds  to  which  they  provide  support,  they’ll  withdraw 
that support from dubious operators and make it more difficult for the perpetrators 
to claim victims. 

So  attention  has  been  directed  to  banks  and  payment  processing  operations  that 
provide  the  means  for  scammers  to  extract  money  from  the  bank  accounts  of  vic-
tims. And attention has also been directed to the list builders, list brokers, and list 
managers  that  help  scammers  identify  elderly  Americans  who  would  be  especially 
susceptible to being cheated by a stranger over the phone. 

List builders are operations that actually create lists of people vulnerable to being 
scammed.  They  may  do  prospecting  mailings  to  tens  or  hundreds  of  thousands  of 
individuals,  promoting  vague  and  misleading  opportunities  to  win  prizes  or  cash  in 
on  a  sweepstakes.  These  prize-oriented  mailings  ask  the  consumer  to  send  back  a 
small check, say $20, as an ‘‘administrative fee’’ or the like. 

People  who  send  a  check  in  response  to  such  mailings  are  prime  candidates  for 
further victimization. They are typically older, and have demonstrated a willingness 
to send money to a stranger in a distant place in response to vague claims regarding 
a sweepstakes or a prize. 

These list building mailings often ask for information that will make it easier for 
fraudulent telemarketers later. They may ask for the consumer’s telephone number, 
and  credit  card  information.  And,  of  course,  they  also  obtain  access  to  the  con-
sumer’s  bank  account,  because  the  routing  numbers  appear  at  the  bottom  of  the 
small check the consumer is asked to send in. 

These  lists  of  responsive,  sweepstakes-oriented  elderly  may  then  be  rented  out 
through  the  efforts  of  list  brokers  and  list  managers.  These  list  brokers  and  man-
agers  may  be  stable,  well-established  businesses  that  deal  in  a  wide  variety  of  cus-
tomer  and  prospect  lists.  Too  often  such  dealers  in  lists  may  exhibit  little  or  no  in-
terest in how the lists were made—that is, whether the people on the list are fraud 
victims—and how someone obtaining the list plans to use it. 

In  summary,  law  enforcement  attention  on  the  facilitators  is  continuing,  on  the 
part  of  the  FTC,  enforcing  the  Telemarketing  Sales  Rule  (TSR),  and  on  the  part  of 
states, enforcing the TSR as well as state law counterparts to the FTC Act. We be-
lieve  that  these  efforts  are  making  it  harder  for  scammers  to  claim  victims,  elderly 
and otherwise, by making needed support structures less available. 
Possible Legislative Approaches 
Broadly address the standard for imposing liability on facilitators 

Under  the  Telemarketing  Sales  Rule,  a  person  who  is  providing  ‘‘substantial  as-
sistance  or  support’’  to  a  telemarketer  can  be  held  responsible  when  that  person 
‘‘knows  or  consciously  avoids  knowing’’  that  the  telemarketer  is  violating  the  law. 
That  involves  establishing  the  mental  state  of  the  facilitator,  which  is  very  chal-

40 

lenging.  A  better  approach  would  be  to  hold  a  facilitator  responsible  if  he  or  she 
‘‘knows  or  should  know’’  that  the  telemarketer  is  violating  the  law.  This  is  more  in 
the  nature  of  an  objective  standard—what  a  reasonable  person  should  be  expected 
to conclude from the surrounding circumstances—and would be a helpful change. 
Address payment systems and banking abuses 

Eliminate  ‘‘demand  drafts,’’  a.k.a.  ‘‘remotely  created  checks,’’  which  are  used  by 
many  telemarketing  scammers  to  reach  directly  into  the  bank  accounts  of  their  el-
derly victims—victims who may not know what happened or know what to do about 
it. 

Lift the preemption constraints that hinder state attorneys general from enforcing 
laws against national banks. Some national banks have neglected any semblance of 
a gate-keeping function by making their banking services available to fraudulent op-
erators.  Banks  in  that  position  should  not  be  shielded  from  having  to  answer  to 
state law enforcement authorities, as well as to Federal banking authorities. 
Addressing the creation and exchange of victim lists 

The broadest approach, and perhaps the least realistic in terms of legislative fea-
sibility,  would  be  to  require  solicitors  that  intend  to  market  their  lists  to  expressly 
inform  consumers,  before  the  transaction  is  consummated,  that  by  responding  the 
consumer’s  name  and  other  information  will  be  made  available  to  other  phone  and 
mail solicitors. Consumers for whom that was an important consideration could sim-
ply choose not to enter into the transaction, and could thus stay off the list. 

A narrower and presumably more realistic approach would be to create additional 
safeguards  that  apply  to  lists  of  the  elderly.  List  brokers  and  list  managers  could 
be  required  to  make  it  their  business  whether  a  given  list  contains  a  dispropor-
tionate  number  of  older  consumers,  and,  if  it  does,  they  should  have  to  determine 
how  the  list  was  compiled  and  how  it  will  be  used.  This  would  require  list  dealers 
to  perform  a  limited  but  meaningful  gate-keeping  function,  rather  than  turning  a 
blind eye, or worse. 

Yet  another  approach  worthy  of  consideration  is  the  creation  of  a  ‘‘Do  Not  Mail’’ 
database, a counterpart to the ‘‘Do Not Call’’ registry that has been so popular with 
consumers.  Differences  in  the  two  contexts—receiving  mail  and  receiving  phone 
calls—may  require  significant  differences  in  scope  and  implementation.  However, 
consumers would likely be grateful for a means of controlling the flow of unsolicited 
mail,  and  it  could  serve  to  impede  exploitive  efforts  to  identify  and  prey  upon  vul-
nerable consumers. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you. 
Mr. Johnson, let me start with you if I may. In general terms on 
the Do Not Call Registry—has it made things better for your mem-
bers? 

Mr.  JOHNSON.  I  think  it’s  a  great  improvement,  and  I  think  the 

Do Not Call Registry has been a great success. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Well,  thank  you  for  saying  that.  And  does  your 
organization  have  an  emphasis  on  educating  your  members  about 
the  availability  of  the  Registry  and  the  fact  that  they  will  have  to 
re-register? 

Mr.  JOHNSON.  We’ve  made  a  great  emphasis  on  the  Do  Not  Call 
Registry.  We  have  not  started  to  tell  people  about  the  need  to  re- 
register, I think that’s something that needs to be done. 

Senator  PRYOR.  You  know,  you  probably  heard  me  talk  to  the 
witness  from  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  a  few  moments  ago. 
In  hearing  her  answers  to  this,  did  you  have  any  concerns  about 
the FTC’s initiative to educate consumers? 

Mr.  JOHNSON.  I’m  not  sure  that  I  recall  what  she  said,  but  the 
need  for  education  is  something  that  we’re  really,  always  in  favor 
of. 

Senator  PRYOR.  OK,  and  do  you  think  we  should  strengthen  the 

current law that we have on the books?

41 

Mr.  JOHNSON.  I  think  it  needs  to  be  strengthened  to  the  extent 
that  the  ability  to  have  fraud  perpetrated  can  be  limited,  or  re-
moved. 

Senator  PRYOR.  OK,  let  me  ask  this—I  think  in  your  opening 
statement, you mentioned the established business relationship ex-
ception,  and  you  expressed  some  concerns  here.  Could  you  run 
through that again for the Committee? 

Mr.  JOHNSON.  What  we  have  found  is  the  business  relationship 
has  to  be  strengthened,  and  better  identified.  Because  if  someone 
merely responds, or asks for information about a product, that puts 
them  in,  in  effect,  as  being  in  a  business  relationship.  And  so,  the 
relationship has to be something that’s ongoing, rather than just a 
mere close call. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Mr.  Cerasale—am  I  pronouncing  your  name 

Mr. CERASALE. You are correct. 
Senator PRYOR. Thank you. 
I believe in your testimony, I want to make sure I heard this cor-
rectly,  but  I  believe  in  your  testimony  you  said  that  the  Do  Not 
Call program had been very, very successful with—? 

Mr.  CERASALE.  Yes,  it  has  been  very  successful.  The  FTC  has 

said it’s been overwhelmingly successful. 

right? 

Senator  PRYOR.  OK,  could  you  explain  the  impact  the  Do  Not 

Call Registry has had on your industry? 

Mr.  CERASALE.  There  has  been,  clearly,  closure  of  some  call  cen-
ters. So that has changed, changed the industry that way. Looking 
for  a  prospect,  trying  to  find  somebody  with  an  offer,  is  generally 
not,  cannot  be  done  as  well  through  the  telephone.  But  all  of  our 
members  have  gone—have  gone  before,  and  are  continuing  to  go 
forward—with  being  multi-channel,  including  potentially,  opening 
retail  stores,  but  reaching  out  through  the  Internet,  reaching  out 
through  the  telephone,  reaching  out  through  the  mail,  and  coordi-
nation with—like that. 

For  example,  you  could  get  a  telephone  call  with—when  a  mail 
piece  is  supposed  to  be  received.  So,  there’s  a  greater  emphasis  on 
being  multi-channel,  with  less  emphasis  on  outgoing  telephone 
calls.  This  is  a  significant  increase,  however,  in  telephone  calls 
coming back to companies. And going to consumer representations, 
and so forth, increase on the companies. 

So  that  has  really,  I  would  say,  exploded  during  this  time.  But 
outgoing telemarketing has had a significant, if not, dramatic turn. 
Senator PRYOR. Let me ask this—on the fee structure of the Fed-
eral  Do  Not  Call  Registry—tell  me  how  that  has  impacted  the  in-
dustry, and how you all deal with that, and how it should be struc-
tured  in  your  view.  I  think  you’ve  touched  on  this  in  your  opening 
statement, but if you could elaborate a little bit. 

Mr.  CERASALE.  Sure.  The  fees  have  gone  up,  significantly.  And 
we  don’t  have  any  complaints  about  how  the  fee  structure  is  ap-
plied. In other words, if I am a marketer, I have to obtain the reg-
istry.  If  I’m  doing  it  nationwide,  I  get  a  national  list.  Also,  if  I’m 
a supplier, someone who does calling for another company—I have 
to  obtain  the  list,  as  well  as  ensure  that  my  client  has,  also  has 
permission  to  use  the  list.  We  have  no  trouble,  problem  with  that.

42 

What’s happened is, that we believe that, the cost of the contract 
with  AT&T  to  run  the  Do  Not  Call  Registry,  I  think,  is  $3.5  mil-
lion.  The  fees  that  are  coming  into  the  Federal  Trade  Commission 
amount  to  approximately  $18  million.  So,  we  think  that  that’s  too 
much.  Our  view  is  that  we  should  use  the  fees  to  cover  the  cost  of 
the  Government  running  the  list,  and  that,  that’s  where  it  should 
be.  But,  in  any  event,  going  up  263  percent,  since  2000—October 
2003,  is  a  little  bit  too  high  an  increase.  So,  therefore  we  support 
your efforts to put a—to set the fee, statutorily—so the FTC doesn’t 
have  to  go  forward,  every  year,  with  rulemaking,  and  to  them 
put—we agree—cost go—sadly, costs go up not down, to put an CPI 
index to it. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you. 
Senator Klobuchar? 

STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Thank  you  very  much,  Senator  Pryor. 
Thank  you  for  the  work,  chairing  this  Committee,  and  for  your 
work  in  guiding  us  as  we  go  forward  with  these  important  issues. 
I must say, that I was involved in these issues as a prosecutor and, 
in  fact,  worked  with  AARP  on  a  State  level.  We  did  a  series  of  fo-
rums for seniors around the State on identity theft and fraud that 
were very successful. 

I  most  remember,  Mr.  Johnson,  one  of  your  most  diligent  mem-
bers in Rochester, Minnesota, in front of 400 seniors, suggesting to 
them that it’s not just enough to shred documents, that he took his 
dog  out  for  a  walk,  and  then  placed  the  dog  droppings  on  top  of 
the shreddings in the garbage can—— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.—so  potential  thieves  would  not  break  in.  I 
then  said,  at  that  moment,  ‘‘You’re  not  suggesting,  sir,  that  every-
one  in  this  room,’’  as  they  diligently  took  notes,  ‘‘do  that?’’  It’s  an 
example of how people make their own decisions in their own lives? 
And  he  said,  ‘‘Well,  unfortunately,  Senator,  my  dog  is  no  longer 
with us, but I now use maple syrup.’’ 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  That  memory  is  strong  in  my  mind,  as  we 
have  these  discussions  in  terms  of  making  sure  that  we  make 
things available, Mr. Cerasale, and at the same time, that we pro-
tect people. I’m a big fan of the Do Not Call List, and I appreciate 
the  work  that’s  been  done  in  the  Senate  before  my  time,  and  I  be-
lieve  that  we  need  to  do  everything  we  can  to  keep  that  in  place, 
and make it stronger than ever. 

And  I  guess,  I’m  first  interested,  Mr.  Johnson,  in  any  ideas  that 
you would have about involving more seniors in this, in the Do Not 
Call  List.  I  know  that  we  encountered  some  issues  of  people  not 
knowing  how  to  get  on  the  registry,  and  that  was  a  lower—correct 
me  if  I’m  wrong—a  lower  percentage  of  some  of  them  registering 
on the Do Not Call list than other demographic age groups? 

Mr.  JOHNSON.  The  thing  that  we’ve  established  is  the  original 
emphasis on the Do Not Call Registry, and the Do Not Call listing. 
We now have State offices, in every one of the States in the United 
States,  and  the  Virgin  Islands,  and  so  we  have  an  ability  to  get  a

43 

better emphasis through to our members, and we will do this again 
through the members’ gatherings and forums, and utilization of our 
State offices. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. OK, thank you. 
And,  Mr.  St.  Clair,  in  your  prepared  remarks,  you  talked  about 
how some of the telemarketing issues that are plaguing seniors and 
others  have,  in  fact,  become  a  global  enterprise.  And,  I  certainly 
encountered that, where we would have people—either by e-mail or 
by  phone—calling  from  all  over  the  world,  and  it  was  very  hard, 
as a local prosecutor, to go after those cases. 

Could  you  talk  a  little  bit  about  your  experiences,  and  what  law 
enforcement tools are available for you to investigate these offshore 
criminals, and how you think it best be done? 

Mr.  ST.  CLAIR.  Well,  it  is  extremely  difficult  for  local,  State  law 
enforcement authorities to deal with international boundaries. And 
we  have  certainly  cooperated,  passed  information  to  Federal  au-
thorities, who may be better situated, and we’ve worked closely, as 
far  as  passing  information  to  the  Canadian  authorities.  And,  I 
think,  when  the  telemarketing  fraud  was  just  getting  started  in 
Canada,  for  example,  it  was  a  little  slow—the  authorities  there,  I 
dare  say,  were  a  little  slow—in  recognizing  the  scope  of  the  prob-
lem,  and  for  the  most  part,  victims  were  not  being  claimed  within 
Canada. 

But after, perhaps, this slow start, we’ve seen great work by Ca-
nadian  authorities,  and  what—part  of  what  we’ve  had  to  do,  given 
the limitations for an Attorney General’s office in a state like Iowa, 
dealing  with  international  boundaries,  is  again  to  turn  our  atten-
tion to the U.S.-based facilitators to try to make a difference there. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you. 
I know one of the things we would always recommend for victims 
of  identity  theft  is  that  they  check  with  the  credit  bureaus.  So,  I 
am  concerned  about  what  I  hear  about  them  being  overburdened 
and not being able to get at some of the major issues here because 
I  always  thought  of  identity  theft  as  the  crime  that  keeps  on  giv-
ing. Once your identity’s stolen, because you’ve given the Social Se-
curity number out to someone, it takes you, sometimes years, to get 
it back, and to correct your credit rating. 

And so I was listening to Ms. Faulkner, and my question for you, 
Ms.  Holland,  is  about  what  this  difference  is,  between  the  free 
credit  reports  that  you’re  required  to  provide  and  the  company’s 
paid monitoring service? 

Ms.  HOLLAND.  The  free  credit  report,  which  is  available  through 
annualcreditreport.com,  is  simply  a  copy  of  their  report  that  out-
lines all of the items in their credit report. 

A credit monitoring service, or credit monitoring product, is a bit 
different.  The  credit  monitoring  product  sends  them  alerts  as  soon 
as there’s a change in their credit report. 

So,  for  example,  you  obtain  your  credit  report,  the  free  report 
from  annualcreditreport.com,  and  that’s  just  a  one-time  snapshot 
based  upon  the  time  you  picked  it  up.  When  you  subscribe  to  a 
monitoring service, you’re going to be alerted every single time that 
there  is  a  change  to  your  credit  report,  and  that  has  proven  to  be 
beneficial to detect and guard against identity theft.

So, what would happen is, if there’s a change in my file, I would 
be  alerted—depending  upon  the  service  or  the  product  that  I  pur-
chased.  And  it  would  say  that  there  has  been  a  change  in  my  re-
port,  and  then  I  would  be  able  to  investigate  what  that  change  is. 
So,  there  is  a  clear  distinction  between  just  getting  a  free  report, 
at  that  one  period  in  time,  versus  having  a  monitoring  service 
that’s going to look at that report, and notify you every time there’s 
a change. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. And again, my interest is making sure that 
consumers  have  easy  access  to  these  credit  reports  since  we  kept 
telling  them  you  can  just  easily  use  one  of  these  credit  agencies. 
If I were to access your website right now, would it be easy for me 
to see where I could access my credit report for free without a fee? 
Or  would  I  be  directed  directly  to  your  company’s  fee-based  credit 
monitoring? 

Ms.  HOLLAND.  You  would  be—it  would,  it  would—up  front,  you 
would  know  that  you  could  get  a  free  report,  because  it  states  it 
there,  and  we  actually  link  you  to  the  free  credit  report  site,  at 
annualcreditreport.com.  So  you  are  keenly  aware  that  you  can  get 
the  free  report.  And  in  our  educational  portion  of  our  website,  we 
talk a lot about being able to obtain that free credit report. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Ms. Faulkner, do you want to add anything 

to this? 

Ms.  FAULKNER.  I  disagree  that  the  credit  monitoring  service  is 
useful  to  consumers.  And,  basically  it’s  because  credit  reports 
change  almost  every  day,  as  creditors  report.  So,  I  had  one  client 
with,  actually,  Equifax’s  credit  monitoring  service,  and  she  was  a 
nervous wreck, because every third day, she would get a notice that 
something  had  changed  on  her  credit  report.  And  she  was  making 
me  a  nervous  wreck,  because  I  had  to  tell  her,  ‘‘Well,  this  is  just 
a  creditor  updating  something,  nobody  is  stealing  your  credit, 
there’s no more adverse information than there was before in it. 

So, I think that the consumers are, perhaps, overwhelmed by the 
credit  monitoring  services,  and  I  think  checking  once  or  twice  a 
year  is  sufficient.  Particularly  when,  in  Connecticut,  you  can  get  a 
copy of your credit report for $7.00. Whereas, if you’re paying nine 
or  ten  dollars  a  month  for  your  credit  monitoring  service,  that’s 
costing a lot more. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Ms. Holland? 
Ms.  HOLLAND.  Yes,  I’d  just  like  to  state,  in  my  role  at  Equifax, 
I  talk  to  consumers  every  single  day.  That’s  my  job,  and  I’m  very 
passionate  about  making  sure  consumers  are  aware  of  what  they 
can  do  to  protect  themselves.  And  I  would  simply  say  to  you  that 
I—we  see,  we  get  numerous  accolades  about  consumers  thanking 
us  for  being  vigilant,  alerting  them  when  they  subscribe  to  those 
services.  They’re  very  thankful  that  they  were  alerted,  because 
they  realize  by  being  notified  early  that  there  has  been  a  change. 
And  remember—they  can  look  at  that  change.  If  that  change  is 
simply  an  update  to  their  balance,  there’s  no  problem  there,  and 
they  close—they  log  off,  and  they  go  on  about  their  business.  So, 
I  don’t  know  that  I—I  don’t  agree  with  Ms.  Faulkner’s  character-
ization, because we have consumers—and I talk to them—and they 
say  that  the  credit  monitoring  product  has  been  very,  very  helpful 
to them.

Senator KLOBUCHAR. All right. Thank you very much. Does any-

one want to add anything to that discussion? 

[No response.] 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  All  right,  well  thank  you.  We  look  forward 
to  working  with  you  as  we  go  ahead  with  both  of  these  areas,  in 
terms  of  perfecting  the  legislation,  and  making  it  easier  for  con-
sumers to access their information. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. 
Let me go ahead and ask you a few more questions, if I may. 
Mr.  Cerasale,  are  there  any  changes  out  there  in  the  market-
place, or changes occurring in your industry that we need to know 
about as we’re crafting a new Do Not Call law? In other words, we 
talked  a  little  bit  about  Voice-over-Internet  Protocol  phones,  we 
talked  a  little  bit  about  cellular  phones.  Are  there  changes  in  the 
industry  or  changes  in  the  marketplace  that  we  need  to  take  into 
consideration? 

Mr.  CERASALE.  Well,  I  think  that  the  first  one,  of  course,  is  that 
one-eighth  of  the  American  public  does  not  have  a  landline  that 
they—their  only  form  of  telephone  is  a  cell  phone.  The  FCC—the 
Federal  Communications  Commission,  under  the  Telephone  Con-
sumer Protection Act—it is, you cannot use those predictive dialers 
to make any solicitation call to them, unless you have express per-
mission.  So  that,  I  think,  if  you  look  at  the  Do  Not  Call  Registry, 
and  the  idea  of  having  cell  numbers  on  it,  that’s  a  repeat.  That’s 
a  cost  to  the  Government,  and  eventually  a  cost  to  the  marketer 
that’s  already  covered  through  another—even  greater  than  the  Do 
Not Call Registry, through the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. 
Because, even if you have an established business relationship, you 
cannot  call  someone  on  a  cell  phone,  unless  you  get  their  permis-
sion. 

Looking  at—I  think  the  idea  of  being  able  to  contact  your  cus-
tomers  is  an  important  one  to  preserve.  And,  so  the  established 
business  relationship  has  worked,  and  works  well.  And  there  is  a 
difference  between  someone  who  has  purchased  something,  or 
someone who has made an inquiry. Even under the current law, an 
inquiry—you  have  3  months  to  try  and  contact  someone,  and  then 
that  business  relationship  expires,  whereas  you  have  18  months 
from  the  time  that  you  completed  the  transaction,  if  you  have  a 
subscription  to  Sports  Illustrated,  for  example,  when  the  subscrip-
tion ended is when the 18 months clock starts. That is a difference 
between  a  customer,  and  someone  who  has  made  an  inquiry,  and 
that has worked. I mean, overwhelmingly, the Federal Trade Com-
mission thinks that this is a product that has worked well. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you. 
Let me move, if I may, very quickly. I want to acknowledge Sen-
ator Thune here, in just one moment, but let me move, if I can, to 
Mr. St. Clair. First I want you to please tell your boss I said hello. 
I  served  with  him  as  Attorney  General,  and  he’s  great.  Tell  him  I 
said hello. 

But second, let me ask about something you said in your opening 
statement  about  list  builders.  Can  you  explain  to  the  Committee 
what  they  do,  who  they  are,  how  the  lists  are  built,  and  how 
they’re used?

Mr. ST. CLAIR. Well, perhaps—perhaps one of the better ways to 
do  that  would  be  an  example.  In  Iowa,  we  discovered  that  a  local 
commercial mail drop was receiving about, ultimately, it was about 
20,000  pieces  of  mail,  all  addressed  to  different—some  nine  dif-
ferent businesses. And we ultimately seized the mail, and upon ex-
amining  it,  we  determined  that  it  was  coming  all  from  a  place  in 
South Carolina, and what they were doing, basically, is mass-mail-
ing  to  a  very  extensive  list,  mailers  that  were  on  their,  on  their 
face—in  our  view—on  their  face,  deceptive,  and  they  were  focused 
on  winning  prizes,  winning  sweepstakes,  and  so  forth.  And,  they 
asked  the  person  to  send  a  small  check,  as  small  as,  say,  some-
times, $10, or $20. And, what this permitted the recipient, in South 
Carolina—of  course  all  of  the  mail  was  ultimately  just  to  be  for-
warded to South Carolina—what this would have permitted the re-
cipient of all of the mail to do, is—in addition to receiving the mod-
est checks, which was undoubtedly welcome, and helped pay for the 
mailing—is  to  create  a  very  hot  list  of  highly  vulnerable  people. 
The people we checked with that were responding to these mailings 
were predominantly elderly. And again, they were self-selecting for 
their  vulnerability,  in  effect,  as  willing  to  send  off  money  at  a  dis-
tance,  to  a  stranger  in  response  to  vague  representations  about 
winning prizes. 

And,  we  ultimately  determined,  in  that  case,  that  some  of  the 
same  mailings  were  later  followed  by  telemarketing  calls  that  re-
ferred  back  to  the  mailings.  And,  so  some  of  the  same  people  who 
had  responded,  you  know,  sent  off  only  $10  or  $20,  you  know,  not 
a  great  loss,  had,  in  effect,  put  themselves  on  the  list,  and  then 
that list was made available to predatory telemarketers, who were 
after thousands of dollars. 

So,  that’s  what  we  mean  by  list  builders,  and  there  are  a  lot  of 
enterprises  out  there,  right  now,  that  appear  to  be  engaged  in 
those sorts of activities. 

Senator PRYOR. Senator Thune? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA 

Senator THUNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank 

the witnesses for being here today, and sharing your insights. 

We’ve  got  146  million  telephone  numbers  that  were  registered 
with  the  Do  Not  Call  list  which  has  been,  I  think,  by  and  large  a 
win  for  consumers.  Families  now  can  choose  to  rid  themselves  of 
many  of  those  calls  that  all  seem  to  come  during  dinnertime,  but 
there  are,  of  course,  still  millions  of  Americans  who  are  not  listed, 
and still receive telemarketing calls for one reason or another, and 
as  some  have  already  pointed  out—often  lonely,  elderly  Americans 
enjoy  receiving  telemarketing  phone  calls  during  the  day.  It’s  im-
portant,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  this  Committee  continue  in  its  over-
sight  duties  to  ensure  that  telemarketing  regulations  and  policies 
we have in place are effective. 

I  just  have  a  couple  of,  I  guess,  quick  questions,  if  I  might,  for 

Mr. Cerasale, is that—did I say that correctly? 
Mr. CERASALE. You said it correctly, Senator. 
Senator  THUNE.  All  right.  It’s  my  understanding  that  list  bro-
kers—those  companies  who  collect  and  sell  lists  of  names  and 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  08:10 Sep 17, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\75784.TXT JACKIE

47 

phone numbers, that are members of the Direct Marketing Associa-
tion are required by DMA to screen list buyers for suspicious activ-
ity.  And,  I  guess  I’m  just—maybe  if  you  could  explain  to  us  what 
that  entails,  and  if  you  think  there  is  more  that  could  be  done  to 
stop bad actors from getting these lists to begin with? 

Mr. CERASALE. The—the members of DMA—the list builders that 
Mr.  St.  Clair  talked  about,  that’s  illegal  from  the  start.  I  mean, 
these are people getting names, and with that mailing, and asking 
for  a  check  on  a  sweepstakes,  which  is  illegal  under  postal  regs, 
and  I’m  sure  illegal  under  most  State  regulations,  making  it  a  lot-
tery, as opposed to a sweepstakes—anyway. So, that’s illegal activ-
ity.  So,  I  want  to  just  make  a  change,  a  switch  from  that,  from  a 
list  broker,  someone  who  obtains  information  from  public  records, 
from  purchased  records,  and  compiles  those  lists.  Or  even  the  list 
of—I subscribe to one magazine, and therefore I exchange or share 
my  list  with  another  magazine.  Or,  for  example,  a  maker  of  a  golf 
ball,  who’s  trying  to  get  the  list  of  subscribers  to  Golf  Magazine  to 
try and send out an offer. 

If  our—we’ve  clarified  our  guidelines  in  the  testimony.  If  you’re 
a  list  compiler—someone  who  gathers  the  list  together,  you  have 
sensitive information—that would be financial information, also de-
fined as seniors. You have to screen the—as a compiler—screen the 
promotion that the list is going to be used for, for appropriateness. 
For  example,  let’s  use  the  example  that  Mr.  St.  Clair  raised.  If 
you  get  the  script  of  the  telemarketing,  or  the  piece  that  was  sent 
through  the  mail  that  says,  ‘‘Here’s  a  chance  to  win  some  money, 
and please send us a $10 check.’’ Well, you don’t do that, that’s ille-
gal. So, that kind of obligation is now upon those list compilers, to 
know  with  whom  they  are  dealing.  And,  I  think  that’s  the  impor-
tant part in making—it’s a stronger guideline, is to ensure that our 
members  know  with  whom  they’re  dealing.  In  other  words,  know 
the  reputation  of  those  with  whom  you’re  dealing.  And,  if  it’s  sen-
sitive  information,  absolutely  ensure  that  you’ve  seen  the  script. 
You see the piece of mail, you see the e-mail. 

Senator THUNE. Mr. Johnson? 
Mr.  JOHNSON.  The  only  information  I  have  about  list  builders  is 
the article in The New York Times which referred to infoUSA. And 
some of the things that they’ve cited were that these lists are com-
prised of names that they’ve obtained—as Mr. Cerasale has said— 
by  various  means,  magazine  subscriptions,  or  whatever.  But 
they’ve  compiled  these,  and  put  them  into  categories,  which  are 
particularly  aimed  at  seniors.  And,  not  only  seniors,  but  groups. 
There’s  a  listing  that  is  headed  as  ‘‘oldies  but  goodies.’’  And  these 
are folks that they found were gamblers, and that they would send 
them out, to people with the recommendation that ‘‘these folks are 
gullible.’’ 

Now,  I  think  that  it’s  something  that  must  be  done  to  say  that 
these  list  compilers,  who  put  this  kind  of  a  caveat,  it’s  almost  tar-
geting the seniors, who have already been found that 50 percent of 
the  folks  that  are  subject  to  this  kind  of  fraud,  are  over  50  years 
of age. 

Senator  THUNE.  Just  as  a  followup,  if  I  might,  Mr.  Johnson, 
we’ve  got  a  high  percentage  of  elderly  citizens  in  South  Dakota, 
many  of  whom  live  in  rural  parts  of  the  state,  and  may  enjoy  re-

48 

ceiving  calls  from  telemarketers,  and  therefore  not  want  to  put 
their name or their number on a Do Not Call list. Do you have any 
suggestions for what we can do to help protect these elderly Ameri-
cans who want to continue receiving telemarketing calls? 

Mr. JOHNSON. I think the only thing we can do is try to educate 
them  that  this  is  not  a  friendly  call.  We’ve  had  reverse  border 
rooms,  when  we’ve  tried  to  put  these  things  in  evidence,  and  that 
gives  a  ‘‘chump  list’’  that  we  receive  from  the  Attorney  General’s 
office.  And  we  call  those  folks  to  alert  them  that  they’re  on  a  list 
of  folks  that  have  been  designated  to  receive  telemarketing  calls— 
and principally, telemarketing fraudulent calls. 

So, the only thing I can suggest, is what we used to do. We would 
make  a  lot  of  effort  to  tell  the  folks  that,  just  hang  up  when  you 
get this. It’s not a person on the other end that’s trying to be your 
friend, it’s someone that’s trying to take your livelihood. 

Mr.  CERASALE.  Enforcement.  Most  of  this  stuff  is  illegal.  As  a 
senior,  many  times  you  are  more  of  a  shut-in,  can’t  get  out  as 
much,  so  that  there,  these  are  means  to  keep  you  in  touch  with 
commerce, in part too. So, it’s not all—I think the impression here 
might be that every call to a senior, every piece of mail that comes 
to a senior is fraudulent—there are many, many legitimate market-
ers  out  there,  and  this  is  the,  the  touch  for  many  seniors  to  reach 
commerce in the United States. 

The  key  is  to  go  after  enforcement.  The  fraud—it’s  illegal  al-
ready. And we need more enforcement—both on the State level, the 
local  level,  the  Federal  level,  to  go  after  and  protect.  I  think  the 
laws  are  there,  and  the  choices  are  there,  I  mean,  even  on  the  Do 
Not  Call  Registry,  as  seniors  go  further  and  further—I  mean,  I’m 
one  of  them.  As  they  say,  as  you  go  further  and  further  down  the 
way, maybe my children can come in and take over, too. And there 
are  means  for  that,  there’s—to  try  and  keep  my  dignity,  but  also 
allow  children  guardians  to  try  and  come  in  and  protect,  if  that’s 
necessary. 

And, so I think the key is, is laws—not the laws, but the enforce-

ment of current laws. And, we’re—we encourage that. 

Senator  THUNE.  Is  that  primarily  a  State  function,  law  enforce-

ment—we’ve got a former Attorney General here? 

Senator PRYOR. I think to a large extent it is. We have an Assist-
ant  Attorney  General  here  who  might  want  to  take  a  stab  at  that. 
But I think States generally will enforce those types of laws. 

Mr.  ST.  CLAIR.  Yes,  I  believe—well,  as  I  think  was  mentioned, 
postal authorities have a lottery prohibition, but I think each State 
has  some  version  of  a  lottery  prohibition.  Sometimes  the  sort  of 
mail  building  efforts,  or  list  building  efforts  we  were  talking  about 
are not clear lottery cases. It’s not a matter, always, of just sending 
$10  in  order  to  be  buying  the  equivalent  of  a  ticket  in  a  lottery. 
If  it  were,  that  would  be  a  fairly  straightforward  lottery  violation. 
But,  sometimes  what  they  are  selling  are,  for  example,  sweep-
stakes  reports.  So  that,  that  permits  the  mailer  to  talk  heavily 
about  sweepstakes,  and  prizes,  and  large  amounts  of  money,  in  a 
confusing fashion, and then ask for an administrative, or a transfer 
fee.  But  the  fee,  in  fact,  is  just—they  would  say,  the  mailer  would 
say—is  just  a  payment,  a  straight-up  payment  for  a  sweepstakes

49 

report,  that  they  then  send  out,  and  the  sweepstakes  report  just 
identifies different publicly accessible sweepstakes. 

And so, so it wouldn’t be so easy to just simply go after them as 
a  lottery.  But,  it  still  has  the  intended  list  building  function,  and 
some of the deceptive aspects are fairly subtle. 

But yes, it’s often a State function. 
Senator THUNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Thank you all very much. 
Senator PRYOR. Thank you. 
And  to  follow  up  on  that,  the  Arkansas  law  is  called  the  Decep-
tive  Trade  Practices  Act,  which  is  just  a  big  umbrella  law  that  we 
use.  We  had  other,  more  specific,  acts,  but  it  seems  like  you  could 
always plug something into the Deceptive Trade Practices Act. 

Let  me  ask,  if  I  may,  Ms.  Holland,  about  CROA.  I  understand 
that you and Ms. Faulkner disagree, or your organizations disagree 
on some of this. 

But,  for  clarification,  Ms.  Holland  from  your  standpoint,  how 
does credit monitoring safeguard against identify theft, or mitigate 
the impact of identity theft? 

Ms.  HOLLAND.  Well,  credit  monitoring  products  provide  con-
sumers with a proactive first line of defense against identity theft. 
And  so,  depending  on  the  product,  notices  and  alerts  can  be  sent 
directly  to  that  consumer,  whenever  changes  are  made  to  the  con-
sumer’s credit report. So, this early detection of a problem through 
credit  monitoring  can  save  a  consumer  the  time  and  expense  that 
otherwise  is  spent  trying  to  correct  fraudulent  activity  after  the 
fact, or fraudulent credit reporting information. So, what it does is 
that,  instead  of  you  checking  your  credit  report  annually,  at 
Equifax,  we  recommend  you  check  your  credit  report  three  or  four 
time a year. But at the end of the day, fraudsters are always look-
ing  to  commit  fraud.  So,  a  consumer  who  has  a  monitoring  service 
that’s  going  to  alert  them  every  time  that  change  comes,  they’re 
going to be more aware of a change versus someone who gets a re-
port three or four times a year. 

And  so,  we  believe  that’s  the  biggest  distinction,  in  that  you  are 
notified  every  time  there’s  a  change  to  the  report,  a  relevant 
change. 

Senator PRYOR. Right, again, for clarification, we’ve talked about 
repair  services  and  monitoring  products,  which  are  two  distinct 
products, or two distinct services, I guess you might say,—— 

Ms. HOLLAND. Correct. 
Senator PRYOR.—that can be offered to consumers. Do you think 
that  these  should  be  treated  differently  under  the  law?  Or  should 
they both be under CROA? 

Ms. HOLLAND. Well, I think if you behave like a credit repair or-
ganization,  then  you  should  be  subject  to  CROA.  The  heart  of  a 
credit  repair  scam,  Chairman  Pryor,  is  to  remove  accurate  and 
timely—but adverse—credit information from a credit report. Well, 
that  not  only  harms  the  individual  integrity  of  the  credit  report, 
but  it  has  the  potential  to  undermine  the  entire  credit  reporting 
system. 

So,  if  you’re  going  out  as  a  credit  repair  organization,  making 
promises  about  how  you’re  going  to  have  accurate  information  re-
moved,  then  you  should  be  subject  to  CROA.  A  credit  monitoring

service  is  a  benefit  to  a  consumer,  as  it  helps  them  not  only  have 
a defense against identity theft, but it also gives them the tools and 
gives  them  the  ability  to  manage  their  credit  report  themselves, 
and  helps  them  learn  and  change  behaviors  about  improving  their 
credit score through personal management of their financial health. 
And  that’s  the  key  about  empowering,  enlightening,  and  enabling 
consumers, to take control of their credit. A credit repair organiza-
tion simply behaves and tells consumers untruths about being able 
to remove information, and they should obviously be subject to the 
harsh penalties of CROA. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Let  me  ask  you  another  question,  Ms.  Holland. 
It’s  my  understanding  that  the  credit  bureaus,  the  consumer 
groups  and  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  have  been  working  to-
gether  for  some  time  to  address  this  issue.  And,  it  seems  that,  as 
much  as  you’ve  tried,  recent  efforts  have  not  been  able  to  create  a 
legislative  product  that  everybody  is  happy  with.  Is  that  a  fair  as-
sessment? 

Ms. HOLLAND. I believe that is a fair assessment, Chairman. 
Senator  PRYOR.  And  does  your  organization  have  language  that 
you would like to see in legislation? Have you all—has your organi-
zation gotten that far? 

Ms.  HOLLAND.  Well,  I  think  we’ve  worked  very  closely—and  I 
think  that’s  an  important  question,  and  rather  than  speculate,  I’d 
like to get back to you and give you that in writing. 

Senator PRYOR. Great, I appreciate that. 
Ms. Faulkner, I know that, again, you disagree with some of the 
answers  you  just  heard  just  a  moment  ago,  but  have  either  you 
personally,  or  your  organization,  been  part  of  these  discussions  to 
try  to  find  language  that  we  can  put  in  a  bill  that  will  satisfy  all 
of the parties? Have you been part of that? 

Ms.  FAULKNER.  I  have.  And  we  have  been  literally  wracking  our 
brains, and we have not been able to come up with something that 
would exempt just credit monitoring, without making a loophole for 
credit repair. 

I can tell you there has been case law recently, in particular, the 
Hillis case, where one of the Federal judges made a really good dis-
tinction between credit improvement—credit monitoring, and credit 
repair organizations, just based on the language of the statute. So, 
it  may  be  that  no  amendment  is  needed  for  the  distinction  to  be 
made  between  credit  monitoring  and  credit  repair.  But,  we  would 
just hate to see anything done that gives the credit clinics one more 
way to scam consumers. 

Senator PRYOR. OK. 
Ms.  Faulkner,  let  me  ask  you  another  last  question,  and  that  is 
something  that  you  mentioned  in  your  opening  statement,  but  you 
didn’t really dwell on it, and it’s not the subject of this hearing, but 
you mentioned arbitration clauses—— 

Ms. FAULKNER. I did. 
Senator  PRYOR.and  distant  forum  clauses.  Is  it  your  experience 
that  you  see  arbitration  clauses,  and  distant  forum  clauses  in— 
what did you say—in credit monitoring? 

Ms. FAULKNER. In the credit clinics. 
Senator PRYOR. OK. 
Ms. FAULKNER. In the credit clinics, yes.

Senator  PRYOR.  And  from  your  standpoint,  how  do  those  dis-

advantage consumers? 

Ms.  FAULKNER.  With  arbitration  clauses,  it  means  the  consumer 
cannot go to court to get his or her rights, and to enforce his rights 
under the CROA. It means they have to go to a private arbitration 
organization. It means that the hearing is secret. It means that the 
wrongdoing  never  gets  publicized.  So,  the  wrongdoing  is  swept 
under the rug in a private manner. 

And,  the  distant  forum  clauses  are  just  to  make  it  more  expen-
sive for the consumer to do anything at all. If you have to go from 
Connecticut  to  California,  in  other  words,  even  for  arbitration,  it’s 
cost-prohibitive.  So,  essentially  what  these  two  clauses  do  is  evade 
liability completely, because no consumer can afford either arbitra-
tion,  or  going  to  a  distance  forum.  We  would  like  to  see  a  local, 
Federal—right to go to your local Federal court. 

Senator  PRYOR.  All  right,  now,  I  know  this  is  a  little  bit  beyond 
the  scope  of  the  hearing,  but  while  we’re  on  that  subject,  are  you 
seeing these type of clauses in other consumer contracts? 

Ms. FAULKNER. Yes. Yes, they are spreading like the plague. 
Senator  PRYOR.  Then,  from  your  standpoint,  they’re  increasing 

out there in the—— 

Ms. FAULKNER. Yes, definitely. 
Senator  PRYOR.  With  that,  hold  on,  let  me  ask  the  staff  if  I 

missed anything. Are we square? 

What  we’ll  do  is,  we’ll  keep  the  record  open  for  14  days,  for  2 
weeks.  And  I  just  want  to  thank  everybody  for  being  here.  Your 
testimony was appreciated and very helpful. 

And  with  that,  like  I  said,  we’ll  leave  the  record  open  for  Sen-
ators, if they choose, to submit questions in writing, and the Com-
merce  Committee  staff  will  forward  them  to  you.  And,  if  you  all 
have opening statements, et cetera, that you want to submit for the 
record, we’ll take care of that, just let us know. 

But again, thank you all for being here, and thank you for being 

involved in the process. 

The hearing is adjourned. 
[Whereupon, at 4 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

A P P E N D I X 

SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENT OF ROBIN HOLLAND, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, 

GLOBAL OPERATIONS, EQUIFAX INC. 

Introduction 

I want to thank you for this opportunity to respond to a question raised by Chair-
man  Pryor  during  the  recent  hearing  on  the  Credit  Repair  Organizations  Act 
(CROA)  reform.  Specifically,  this  Supplemental  Statement  will  address  the  type  of 
CROA  reform  necessary  to  combat  credit  repair  organizations,  while  protecting  le-
gitimate credit monitoring products and services. 

Subsequent  to  the  enactment  of  CROA,  credit  monitoring  has  been  developed  to 
give  consumers  a  first  line  of  defense  against  identity  theft  and  to  increase  con-
sumer  literacy  regarding  credit  matters.  The  credit  bureaus  seek  statutory  reforms 
that  conclusively  establish  that  credit  monitoring  and  similar  credit  information 
products  and  services  are  not  subject  to  CROA.  As  indicated  by  Joanne  Faulkner’s 
testimony  at  the  hearing,  consumer  groups  fear  that  such  reforms  would  open  the 
door for credit repair organizations (CROs) to evade the requirements of CROA. For 
the reasons set forth below, Equifax believes that such fears are unfounded. 
Defining Credit Repair 

CROs are defined as entities that use any instrumentality of interstate commerce 
to  sell,  provide,  or  perform  (or  represent  that  they  can  perform)  services  or  advice 
for  the  express  or  implied  purpose  of  improving  a  consumer’s  credit  record,  credit 
history, or credit rating in return for a fee.1 As noted by Ms. Faulkner in her writ-
ten  statement,  CROs  intentionally  and  systematically  deceive  not  only  consumers, 
but the credit bureaus. In contrast, credit monitoring and similar credit information 
products  and  services  were  developed  to  help  improve  consumer  understanding 
about their credit history. 

CROA  was  originally  enacted  to  stop  CROs  from  harming  consumers  and  the 
credit  reporting  system  through  credit  repair  activities.  Looking  to  the  legislative 
history,2 Congress did not seek to place limitations on all products and services that 
pertain to credit, but instead sought to target narrowly those specific harmful activi-
ties  performed  by  CROs.  Congress  did  not  intend  for  the  definition  of  a  CRO  to 
sweep  in  products  that  offer  only  prospective  credit  advice  to  consumers  or  provide 
information to consumers so that the consumers can take steps on their own to im-
prove  their  credit  in  the  future.  Credit  monitoring  and  similar  credit  information 
products and services should not be swept into the definition of CRO, because such 
products provide information that empowers rather than harms consumers. 

CROA  is  enforced  by  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  (FTC).  The  FTC  staff  has 
stated that there is no basis to subject the sale of credit monitoring and similar edu-
cational  products  to  CROA’s  specific  prohibitions  and  requirements,  which  were  in-
tended to rein in fraudulent credit repair. The FTC staff has even commended credit 
monitoring  products—if  promoted  and  sold  in  a  truthful  manner—as  a  way  to  help 
consumers maintain an accurate credit file and provide them with valuable informa-
tion for combating identity theft. 
A Behavior-based Solution 

CROA  can  be  amended  to  prevent  the  type  of  abusive  practices  that  Congress 
originally  intended  to  address  by  taking  a  behavior-based  approach  to  the  applica-
tion  of  CROA’s  requirements.  By  applying  CROA  to  only  those  entities  engaged  in 
the  potentially  fraudulent  activities  known  as  credit  repair,  CROA  can  be  reformed 
in  a  way  that  continues  to  protect  consumers  from  those  activities  and  permits  the 

1 Sec.  403(3)  of  the  Credit  Repair  Organizations  Act,  Public  Law  90–321,  82  Stat.  164,  15 

U.S.C. S. § 1679a (2006). 

2 See H.R. Rep. No. 103–486, at 57 (Apr. 28, 1994), and see also Hearing on the Credit Repair 
Organizations  Act  (H.R.  458)  Before  the  Subcommittee  on  Consumer  Affairs  and  Coinage  of  the 
House Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs, 100th Congress (Sept. 15, 1988).

provision  of  legitimate  credit  monitoring  products  and  similar  credit  information 
products and services outside of the technical provisions of CROA. The nature of the 
activity performed by the entity would trigger application of CROA, rather than the 
characterization  those  entities  assign  to  their  products  and  services.  An  example  of 
this approach can be seen in a House bill (H.R. 2885), introduced by Rep. Paul Kan-
jorski,  which  sets  out  in  detail  the  type  of  credit  monitoring  activities  that  would 
not be covered by CROA. 

Through this behavior-based approach, CROA would be able to reach credit repair 
services regardless of whether the entity claims to be a CRO or a provider of credit 
monitoring.  Improperly  characterizing  either  the  product  being  sold  or  the  entity 
making the offer will not achieve the purpose of evading CROA. Credit repair orga-
nizations  that  purport  to  offer  legitimate  services,  but  actually  engage  in  credit  re-
pair  operations  will  still  be  subject  to  CROA.  Conversely,  if  an  entity  offers  legiti-
mate and beneficial products, such as credit monitoring, then the activity-based ap-
proach to CROA enforcement would permit such activities to continue without being 
subject  to  CROA.  Through  such  reforms,  no  entity  could  escape  the  consumer  pro-
tection  requirements  of  CROA,  but  consumers  would  benefit  from  the  increased 
availability of other legitimate products, such as credit monitoring. 

To  the  benefit  of  consumers,  the  FTC  has  developed  extensive  expertise  in  inves-
tigating entities engaged in unfair or deceptive trade practices through Section 5 of 
the  FTC  Act.  See  15  U.S.C.  § 45(a).  The  FTC  specializes  in  distinguishing  between 
what companies say they do and what those companies actually do. Given a clearly 
established  definition  of  credit  repair  activity,  with  specific  exceptions  in  place  for 
credit information products and services such as credit monitoring products, and the 
FTC’s  expertise  with  respect  to  deceptive  practices,  the  FTC  should  easily  be  able 
to  recognize  any  attempt  to  mischaracterize  an  illegal  credit  repair  service  as  a  le-
gitimate credit monitoring product. To the extent a credit repair organization falsely 
purported to offer CROA-exempt products or services to evade CROA coverage, they 
could be in violation of both CROA and Section 5 of the FTC Act. 
The Hillis Case 

Ms.  Faulkner  suggested  during  the  hearing  that  reforms  to  CROA  are  unneces-
sary because a judge in a recent case, Hillis v. Equifax Consumer Services, Inc., 237 
F.R.D. 491 (N.D. Ga. 2006), was able to distinguish between credit repair and credit 
monitoring  under  existing  law.  The  judge  in  the  Hillis  case  rejected  a  broad  inter-
pretation of the definition of CRO, and concluded that ‘‘Congress could not have in-
tended these terms to encompass all credit-related advice.’’ Hillis, p. 512. 

However, Ms. Faulkner’s argument that taking no legislation action is the proper 
solution in light of this decision misses the mark. The court in Hillis recognized that 
if  providers  of  credit  monitoring  are  considered  CROs,  it  will  be  highly  impractical 
for those entities to comply with the technical provisions of the CROA and still pro-
vide  the  type  of  credit  information  being  sought  by  consumers.  Not  every  court  is 
the  same,  and  not  all  judges  will  necessarily  have  the  wisdom  of  the  Hillis  judge. 
Without reforming CROA to definitively establish that credit monitoring and similar 
credit information products and services are not credit repair activities, similar liti-
gation could result in significant harm to companies that offer credit monitoring. 

The  total  cost  of  the  Hillis  settlement  will  be  well  over  $4  million.  Equifax  and 
Fair  Isaac  will  pay  up  to  $4  million  in  attorney’s  fees  and  costs  to  the  Hillis  class 
counsel,  and  the  two  named  plaintiffs  will  each  receive  up  to  $7,500.  Additionally, 
the  more  than  6  million  putative  members  of  the  Hillis  class  are  eligible  to  receive 
either  three  or  six  free  months  of  Score  WatchTM (depending  on  whether  they  pur-
chased an eligible product from only one or both of Equifax and Fair Isaac), a prod-
uct  which  provides  monitoring  of  the  consumer’s  FICO® Credit  Score  and  two  free 
Score  Power® reports.  The  retail  value  to  each  putative  class  member  of  this  free 
product  benefit  is  at  least  $24  (for  3  months)  or  $48  (for  6  months).  Equifax  and 
Fair  Isaac  also  agreed  to  pay  for  the  costs  of  printing  and  mailing  postcard  notices 
to  class  members,  a  settlement  website  with  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  a  tele-
phone  assistance  program,  as  well  as  other  settlement  administrative  expenses. 
Without  CROA  reform,  new  lawsuits  could  be  brought  which  would  push  litigation 
costs even higher. 

Ironically,  the  Hillis  court  approved  the  settlement  in  part  because  Equifax  and 
Fair Isaac agreed to provide a disclaimer stating that it is not a credit repair organi-
zation  and  that  Equifax  does  not  offer  credit  repair  advice  to  consumers.  This  has 
always  been  the  position  of  Equifax,  a  position  we  seek  to  have  established  conclu-
sively through reform of the CROA statute.

Conclusion 

CROA  should  be  reformed  so  that  it  is  clear  that  entities  that  offer  credit  moni-
toring  and  similar  credit  information  products  and  services  are  not  subject  to  the 
requirements  and  restrictions  placed  on  CROs.  These  products  and  services  benefit 
consumers in a way that can be easily distinguished from the harmful credit repair 
activities  performed  by  CROs.  By  reforming  the  CROA  statute  to  take  a  behavior- 
based look at an entity’s activities, credit monitoring and similar credit information 
products and services can remain available to consumers without throwing open the 
door for CROs to evade the consumer protections put into place by CROA. 

SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENT OF JOANNE S. FAULKNER, ATTORNEY, ON BEHALF OF THE 

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CONSUMER ADVOCATES 

Senator  Pryor  left  the  record  open  for  2  weeks.  At  the  end  of  the  hearing,  he 
asked  whether  I  had  seen  mandatory  predispute  arbitration  clauses  and  distant 
forum clauses in credit monitoring services. I now have. 

My  own  bank,  Bank  of  America,  offered  Bank  of  America  Privacy  Assist  Pre-
mierTM (Trademark  of  FIA,  Inc.).  The  service  includes  ‘‘automatic  alerts  when  cer-
tain changes occur in your credit files from 3 major credit reporting agencies; unlim-
ited online access to your 3 credit reports; ID theft recovery assistance from trained 
specialists, and identity theft insurance.’’ 

The  agreement  also  includes  binding  arbitration  before  the  American  Arbitration 
Association in Washington, DC, together with other clauses limiting consumer rem-
edies. 

The Equifax website would not reveal the terms of the contract until after I filled 
out an enrollment form including much personal information (which I would not do). 
However, a report on the Internet reveals that an Equifax credit monitoring service 
‘‘agreement also specifies that users are forced into binding arbitration if they have 
any  disputes  with  the  service,  rather  than  pursue  litigation,  except  in  small  claims 
court.’’ http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/05/paypallequifax.html. 

Contrary to the testimony of Ms. Holland, the website for Equifax Personal Solu-
tions  does  not  mention  the  free  credit  report.  It  may  be  found  by  typing  Equifax 
Credit  Monitoring  into  a  search  engine  and  selecting  Personal  Solutions,  or  at

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG TO 

LYDIA B. PARNES 

Question  1.  Do  Not  Call  telephone  number  registrations  will  expire  during  the 
summer of 2008 for all consumers who registered their telephone numbers in 2003. 
At  the  hearing,  you  indicated  that  the  Commission  will  conduct  a  consumer  edu-
cation campaign to inform consumers of the need to re-register. Can you please pro-
vide  more  details  about  the  Commission’s  plans  for  educating  consumers  about  the 
need to re-register and how to do so? 

Answer. The FTC will conduct a consumer education campaign beginning in early 
2008  to  explain  the  registry  and  that  some  numbers  will  need  to  be  re-registered. 
The  campaign  will  be  modeled  on  the  highly  successful,  award-winning  marketing 
campaign  for  the  registry  in  2003.  The  FTC  will  provide  focused  messages  for  con-
sumers  and  the  media,  as  well  as  products  such  as  web  buttons  and  banners,  arti-
cles,  and  short  videos  that  can  be  disseminated  by  the  agency’s  communications 
partners—including  industry  associations,  non-profit  groups,  government  agencies, 
and congressional offices. There is a high level of interest in the registry among con-
sumers and the media, and the FTC will provide plain-language information for con-
sumers about how to take advantage of the registry. 

Question 2. The need to re-register could lead to confusion among consumers who 
do  not  know  when  they  registered  for  the  Do  Not  Call  list,  and,  as  a  result,  will 
not  know  whether  they  need  to  re-register  in  2008  or  at  some  later  date.  How  can 
consumers determine when they need to re-register? 

Answer. Consumers can access the National Registry at any time to confirm that 
their  telephone  numbers  are  registered  and  when  the  registrations  will  expire  by 
visiting our website at www.donotcall.gov or calling our toll-free numbers 888–382– 
1222 (TTY 866–290–4236). Consumers also can re-register their telephone numbers 
at any time through the same website or toll-free numbers. They do not need to wait 
until  their  registration  expires.  Telephone  numbers  remain  on  the  registry  for  5 
years from the date of the most recent registration. We will include this information 
in our consumer education campaign planned for early 2008.

Question  3.  Some  credit  monitoring  companies  advertise  ‘‘free  credit  reports’’  to 
consumers  who  subscribe  to  their  pay  credit  monitoring  services.  Often,  these  com-
panies’ websites have only a small-print link to information about receiving the free 
annual  credit  report  to  which  every  consumer  is  entitled  by  law.  Has  the  FTC  re-
ceived  complaints  from  consumers  who  unwittingly  subscribed  to  pay  credit  moni-
toring services when all they wanted was to get their free credit report? 

Answer. Since the annual free credit report program went into effect in September 
2004,  the  FTC  has  received  a  number  of  complaints  from  consumers  about  ‘‘im-
poster’’ 
free  report  websites  that  mimic  the  FACT  Act-required  website, 
www.annualcreditreport.com.  These  sites  typically  use  URLs  that  are  common 
misspellings of annualcreditreport.com or are sound-alike names. In many cases, the 
imposter  sites  offer  free  reports  in  conjunction  with  the  purchase  of  a  credit  moni-
toring  service.  The  credit  monitoring  typically  is  sold  on  a  ‘‘free-to-pay  conversion’’ 
basis,  i.e.,  the  service  is  free  for  a  short  period,  but  converts  to  an  automatically- 
renewing paid service unless the consumer affirmatively cancels within the free pe-
riod.  This  type  of  promotion  is  a  variation  on  the  more  general  category  of  ‘‘con-
tinuity’’ or ‘‘negative option’’ plans, whereby consumers are automatically sent prod-
ucts and billed on a periodic basis until they cancel. 

The FTC carefully monitors impostor sites and has sent warning letters to opera-
tors of more than 130 such sites explaining that attempts to mislead consumers are 
illegal.1 Most of these sites have been taken down. The FTC also takes enforcement 
action in appropriate cases. 

For example, in 2005, the Commission charged Consumerinfo.com, a subsidiary of 
Experian  and  the  operator  of  the  ‘‘freecreditreport.com’’  site,  with  deceptively  mar-
keting  ‘‘free  credit  reports.2 The  Commission  alleged  that  Consumerinfo  deceived 
consumers  by  not  adequately  disclosing  that  consumers  who  took  advantage  of  the 
free  credit  report  offer  automatically  would  be  signed  up  for  a  credit  monitoring 
service and charged $79.95 if they did not cancel within 30 days. The Commission’s 
complaint  further  alleged  that  Consumerinfo  misled  consumers  by  promoting  its 
‘‘free  reports’’  without  disclosing  that  it  was  not  associated  with  the  official  annual 
free  credit  report  program.  In  settlement  of  those  charges,  the  FTC  required 
Consumerinfo  to  pay  redress  to  deceived  consumers,  barred  deceptive  and  mis-
leading  claims  about  ‘‘free’’  offers,  required  clear  and  prominent  disclosures  of  the 
terms  and  conditions  of  any  ‘‘free’’  offers,  required  clear  and  prominent  disclosures 
that  its  promotion  is  not  affiliated  with  the  FACT  Act  free  report  program,  and  re-
quired the defendant to disgorge $950,000. 

Earlier  this  year,  the  FTC  charged  Consumerinfo  with  disseminating  advertise-
ments  after  entry  of  the  settlement  that  violated  the  disclosure  requirements.3 
Consumerinfo was required to pay $300,000 in additional ill-gotten gains. 

The FTC also has engaged in extensive outreach efforts to warn consumers about 
imposter  free  credit  report  promotions.  The  Commission  maintains  a  micro-site  on 
its  website  devoted  to  the  free  annual  credit  report  program.4 The  micro-site  links 
directly  to  annualcreditreport.com  so  that  consumers  can  be  sure  they  are  not  mis-
directed  to  an  imposter  site.  The  micro-site  also  links  to  educational  materials  for 
consumers about the free annual report program and how to avoid imposters.5 Addi-
tional  materials  available  through  the  micro-site  advise  consumers  about  avoiding 
deceptive ‘‘trial offers’’ and other types of continuity promotions.6 The FTC also has 
produced  radio  public  service  announcements  warning  about  imposter  free  report 
sites.7 In  addition,  the  FTC  mails  copies  of  its  education  materials  to  consumers 
who call the FTC’s toll-free complaint hotline.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG TO 

RICHARD JOHNSON 

57 

Question.  Next  summer,  every  consumer  who  registered  on  the  Do  Not  Call  list 
in  2003  will  have  to  re-register.  What  is  your  organization  doing  to  prepare  for  the 
re-registration? 

Answer.  AARP  shares  the  concern  of  Members  of  Congress  regarding  consumers’ 
need to re-register for the Do Not Call Registry next year. The DNCR is one of the 
most successful consumer programs initiated by the government. With over 140 mil-
lion telephone numbers registered on the list, consumers have realized a substantial 
decrease  in  the  number  of  unwanted  telemarketing  calls  they  receive  in  their 
homes.  Consumers  will  most  certainly  want  to  continue  to  participate  in  this  valu-
able program. 

AARP  will  use  its  resources  to  inform  its  39  million  members  about  the  re-reg-
istration  process  through  a  number  of  communication  avenues  that  could  include 
AARP  publications,  outreach  materials,  the  Web,  our  call  center,  and  AARP’s  state 
offices and volunteer network. AARP will work closely with the Federal Trade Com-
mission  and  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  to  ensure  that  consumer  in-
formation about this process is clear and non-misleading.

in  2003  will  have  to  re-register.  What  is  your  organization  doing  to  prepare  for  the 
re-registration? 

Answer.  Approximately  one  third  of  the  numbers  on  the  National  Do  Not  Call 
Registry  will  need  to  be  re-registered  by  October  2008.  The  remaining  two  thirds 
of  the  numbers  will  need  to  re-register  over  the  course  of  the  next  5  years.  As  in 
2003,  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  will  be  using  publicity,  mainly  through  the 
press, but also on its publications, on its website and in its announcements, to pro-
mote the need for citizens to re-register their telephone numbers after 5 years. Since 
the  initial  publicity  in  2003  was  very  successful,  the  DMA  expects  the  2008  cam-
paign to meet similar success. 

As  I  testified,  30  percent  to  40  percent  of  the  telephone  numbers  on  the  Registry 
are not useful for marketers following either the Federal Trade Commission or Fed-
eral  Communications  Commission  regulations.  They  are  abandoned  numbers,  busi-
ness  numbers,  cell  numbers  and  fax  numbers  that  clutter  the  registry  increasing 
costs to all. We hope that the new contractor for the Do Not Call Registry will take 
advantage  of  the  5  year  timing  to  improve  the  hygiene  of  the  list—making  it  more 
effective and less costly. 

DMA  is  telling  its  members  to  be  mindful  that  the  telephone  numbers  placed  on 
the Registry in 2003 were done so by consumers wanting to limit telephone solicita-
tions.  Therefore,  after  the  5-year  period  ends,  many  of  those  consumers  may  want 
to re-register their telephone numbers, and marketers should provide them the time 
to do so before presenting any marketing offers via telephone.
