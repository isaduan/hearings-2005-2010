EXAMINING  THE  FEDERAL  AVIATION 

ADMINISTRATION’S  AGE  60  RULE 

TUESDAY,  JULY  19,  2005 

U.S. SENATE, 

SUBCOMMITTEE ON AVIATION, 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Subcommittee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  3:30  p.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building.  Hon.  Conrad  Burns, 
Chairman of the Subcommittee, presiding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CONRAD BURNS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA 

Senator BURNS. We’ll call the Committee to order, thank you for 
coming today and thank you for joining us, and I welcome the wit-
nesses, I would hope that Senator Inhofe is on his way, somewhere, 
if not, we’ll let him make his statement when he gets here. 

We’re  conducting  this  hearing  on  the  controversial  FAA  Age  60 
Rule.  It’s  our  intention  to  re-visit  this  issue  because  of  substantial 
changes in the aviation industry and because of financial struggles 
many  of  the  carriers  are  going  through.  Those  struggles  have  ad-
versely affected many of our pilots. With tensions posing significant 
problems,  it  might  be  time  to  take  a  serious  look  at  altering  that 
Rule. 

Since  1960,  Federal  regulations  have  specified  that  individuals 
age 60 and older may not serve as airline pilots on any commercial 
flight  operations.  The  FAA  adopted  what  is  commonly  referred  to 
as  the  ‘‘Age  60  Rule’’  in  1959,  because  of  concerns  that  a  hazard 
to safety was presented by aging pilots in air carrier operations. 

Over the years there have been several attempts to challenge the 
Rule, but to date no pilot has ever been granted an exemption, and 
no Federal court has ruled in favor of changing the Rule. Based on 
this  history,  it  is  evident  that  any  change  or  modification  to  the 
Rule will likely require Congressional action. 

The  Subcommittee  is  very  much  aware  of  the  emotion  attached 
to the issue for many pilots. In light of the current financial condi-
tion  of  the  airlines  and  the  continuing  pension  problems,  I  think 
it is important that we revisit this issue. 

On today’s panel we will hear medical testimony along with var-
ied pilots’ opinions and experience with the Rule. As with any avia-
tion  issue,  safety  is  of  the  utmost  concern,  it  is  with  this  Senator 
anyway, but safety should also be based on facts, and not arbitrary 
or  subjective  dynamics.  I  welcome  the  panels  and  look  forward  to 
the testimony.

Congressman  Gibbons  from  Nevada,  thank  you  very  much  for 
coming,  and  do  you  have  an  opening  statement,  Senator  Stevens? 

STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Senator STEVENS. I think I have a conflict of interest. 
Senator  BURNS.  No  comment.  That’s  how  you  stay  in  good  stead 

with your Chairman. 

Congressman  Gibbons,  I  look  forward  to  your  testimony,  thank 

you for coming today, by the way. 

STATEMENT OF HON. JIM GIBBONS, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, 

2ND DISTRICT, NEVADA 

Mr.  GIBBONS.  Thank  you,  Senator  Burns,  and  Senator  Stevens, 
thank  you  for  allowing  me  to  be  here  to  testify  on  an  issue  that 
is  very  near  and  dear  to  my  heart,  and  personally  to  millions  of 
current and future commercial airline pilots. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  worked  as  a  commercial  airline  pilot  for 
17  years,  and  recently  I  just  reached  the  age  of  60.  While  this  bill 
will not, and nor is it intended, to benefit me personally, I am out-
raged  by  the  blatant  age  discrimination  that  continues  to  be  per-
petuated  by  this  FAA  Rule.  Both  the  Equal  Employment  Oppor-
tunity  Commission  and  the  AARP  agree  that  the  Age  60  Rule  is 
a biased, unfair regulation that effectively deprives the flying pub-
lic of some of the best pilots that our country has to offer. 

Senator Inhofe and I have worked for several Congresses to pass 
legislation  that  will  extend  the  mandatory  pilot  retirement  age  be-
yond 60. In the current Congress, our legislation would repeal that 
rule  and  allow  pilots  to  remain  in  the  cockpit  until  they  reach  the 
age  at  which  they  can  receive  their  full  Social  Security  retirement 
benefits. This comes down to a basic fairness issue. 

Current  FAA  regulations  require  that  commercial  airline  pilots 
leave  the  cockpit  5  years  before  most  are  even  eligible  to  receive 
Social Security benefits. Now, these pilots are only asking that they 
be able to continue to work in the field that they have been trained 
for, and worked in their whole lives, until they can get their Social 
Security  benefits.  I  certainly  do  not  think  that  this  is  too  much  to 
ask.  Especially  since  there  is  absolutely  no  proof  to  show  that  a 
pilot  is  any  less  capable  at  the  age  of  59  years,  364  days,  than  a 
pilot who is 60 years old. 

The fact is, several studies have shown that older pilots have bet-
ter safety records than their younger colleagues, and that pilots 60 
years or older, tend to be healthier than their cohorts in the popu-
lation  at  large.  In  addition,  65  year  old  pilots  would  still  have  to 
go through the same rigorous testing and training that 25 year old 
pilots do. Now this includes flight physicals twice a year, and EKG 
heart  tests  every  year.  The  Federal  laws  were  not  intended  to 
micromanage  what  is  the  responsibility  of  the  airlines  themselves. 
Unsafe pilots must be detected and relieved of duty by the airline, 
no  matter  what  age,  and  safe  pilots  should  be  allowed  to  continue 
to fly, period. That’s the job of airlines. 

Historically  speaking,  let’s  dispel  the  myth,  right  now,  that  the 
Age  60  Rule  was  created  to  improve  airline  safety—it  wasn’t.  The 
FAA  Age  60  Rule  is  an  ancient  relic  of  a  bygone  era  in  which  one

airline in 1959, seeking relief from a labor dispute, curried political 
favor  and  forced  the  implementation  of  a  rule  which  served  to 
shove its older pilots out the door, period. 

It’s time for this rule to be overturned, and for the United States 
to  provide  the  same  opportunities  as  most  industrialized  nations 
do.  We  can  look  overseas,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  in  the  sky  right 
above  this  very  building,  for  proof  that  the  Rule  is  outdated  and 
serves no safety purpose whatsoever. 

Over 50 countries allow their commercial airline pilots to fly past 
age  60,  including  Canada,  Australia,  Israel,  Japan,  and  31  Euro-
pean countries as well. Furthermore, the FAA allows these foreign 
pilots  to  fly  into,  and  over  the  United  States.  On  top  of  that,  the 
FAA’s own pilots are allowed to fly past their 60th birthday. If for-
eign  and  FAA  pilots  are  good  enough  to  fly  the  friendly  skies  past 
their 60th birthday, then our own commercial pilots should be able 
to do so as well. 

In  closing,  I  want  to  reiterate  that  this  legislation,  H.R.  65  and 
Senator Inhofe’s legislative bill S. 65, do not in any way require pi-
lots to work past age 60 if they don’t want. Nor does it require air-
lines  to  rehire  any  pilot  that  has  had  to  retire  already  due  to  the 
Rule.  Our  bill  simply  brings  fairness  to  our  pilots  by  closing  the 
gap  between  their  forced  retirement  and  their  ability  to  collect  So-
cial  Security.  In  a  time  of  failing  pensions  and  soaring  passenger 
numbers, we only want to allow our pilots to provide for their fami-
lies and to retire with dignity. 

Again,  I  want  to  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  the  Ranking 
Member  as  well,  for  allowing  me  to  speak  to  your  Committee  on 
this  very  important  bill,  it’s  my  hope  that  we  can  repeal  this  dis-
criminatory  age  rule  as  soon  as  possible.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair-
man. 

Senator BURNS. Thank you, Congressman, we appreciate—— 
[Applause.] 
Senator BURNS. No, no, no, no, no. We don’t allow outbursts here 
at  all,  no  matter  what  your  leanings  may  be.  But  it’s  nice  to  have 
you  here,  how’s  that.  Your  faces  here  tell  us  much  more  than  the 
noise that you make. 

Unfortunately,  Senator  Rockefeller  couldn’t  make  it  today,  he 
had some family business to take care of that was unavoidable. He 
will submit a statement and then we’ll go on with the hearing, and 
I assume he will have some questions for the witnesses today, and 
if he does, we will handle that in due time. 

Senator Inhofe, nice to have you. 

STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES M. INHOFE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM OKLAHOMA 

Senator INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator BURNS. You’re welcome. 
Senator  INHOFE.  Nice  to  be  here  with  you,  and  I,  let  me,  first  of 
all,  thank  both  of  you,  both  Chairman  Stevens,  and  Chairman 
Burns for being the original co-sponsors of this legislation. 

I  was  crossing  things  off  as  Jim  Gibbons  was  making  his  state-
ment,  so  I’ve  dramatically  shortened  what  I  was  going  to  say,  but 
I  think  that,  you  know,  if  you  look  at  it,  my  preference  would  not 
just  be  65  years  old.  I  know  people  who  are  old  at  age  50,  and  I

4 

know  people  who  are  good  pilots  well  past  70,  I  happen  to  be  70 
years old today, I mean, now—not today—I’ve been 70 years old for 
quite a while, and I, you know, if you are taking the very stringent 
proficiency tests and medical tests, there’s no reason you can’t con-
tinue to fly, it is purely arbitrary, if you look at the different orga-
nizations,  the  ICAO,  I  don’t  know  whether  you  talked  about  that 
or  not,  but  the  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  stated  in 
a recent report that there is no medical evidence to support an age 
restriction of the amount here. Only 25 countries have an age limit 
of 60 or less, the United States and France are the only developed 
nations  with  limits  this  low,  and  I  don’t  think  either  of  the  Chair-
men  up  there  would  like  that  distinction  of  being  the  only  country 
joining France in their policies. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  INHOFE.  The  news  is  full  of  reports  of  airline  pension 
funds  being  terminated  and  turned  over  to  the  Pension  Benefit 
Guaranty  Corporation,  I  think  the  legislation  introduced  by  Con-
gressman  Gibbons  and  me  will  help  alleviate  this  burden  on  tax-
payers and the airlines. 

I  want  to  also  say  that  there  are  some  organizations  like  the 
AARP,  you’d  expect  them  to  be  supportive  of  this,  they  are  sup-
portive  of  this,  and  they  had  quite  a  statement  to  make  on  it. 
The—if  you  look  back  and  see  how  this  came  about  in  the  first 
place, and why the ALPA right now is in support of it. 

I’ve talked to a number of the officers in ALPA, they’re good peo-
ple,  they’re  my  friends—I  make  it  a  point  to  be  friendly  with  the 
people  I  work  with,  and  they  are  good.  Although,  if  you  stop  and 
think  about  the  decision  that  they  made  in  opposing  extending  it 
to age 65—it was a political decision. I mean, there are enough peo-
ple who want the vertical mobility that would bring them up to an 
age where they could have a longer career. Now, I think as I recall, 
the margin was very thin in terms of the pilots’ unions in their op-
position  to  this,  there  are  many  pilots  that  are  very  much  for  it. 
I  guess  the  only  other  thing  I  would  say  is,  when  you  look  at 
what  has  happened  in  the  past,  this  Age  60  Rule  came  in  1959,  I 
believe,  wasn’t  it,  Jim?  At  that  time,  the  life  expectancy  was  8 
years  younger  than  it  is  today.  And  if  you’re  going  to  go  by  that, 
and you go by every rule we have with Social Security or any other 
program that’s year to age—they increase that age as time goes on, 
they haven’t increased this in almost 50 years. 

And I would at last say, when I was involved in a rally with Con-
gressman Gibbons, I felt—you know, after all, they have a lot more 
hours than he does—I found out he’s got 19,000? Twenty two thou-
sand,  and  I  only  have  11,000,  so  he  has  twice  as  many  hours  as 
I do, but I’ve been flying, probably, a few more years. 

And I would say this—— 
Mr. GIBBONS. I wasn’t flying without a prop, by the way. 
Senator INHOFE. Well, and I’ll tell that story, then, I think that’s 

very significant. 

At  age  65  I  was  flying  a  twin—no,  I  was  flying  a  single-engine 
plane—down to Tinker Air Force Base when, not just the propeller, 
Chairman  Burns,  came  off,  but  the  fly  wheel  and  a  whole  bunch 
of stuff. This was a four-passenger, single engine airplane. Now, for 
those in the audience, and you folks certainly are so knowledgeable

5 

in this, you realize if you take 300 pounds off of a single-engine air-
plane, and you’re alone in the airplane, that does something to the 
airplane. 

First  of  all,  I  need  to  determine  where  the  new  stalling  speed 
was  on  that  airplane.  I  found  out  it  was  not  at  48  knots,  it  was 
120  knots.  There’s  the  bad  news,  the  good  news  is,  you  take  the 
front  end,  a  prop  off  of  an  airplane,  you  can  coast  a  long  ways.  So 
I  did,  and  I  was  able  to  make  it  back  to  an  airport  and  make  a 
landing—it wasn’t pretty, but I’m here today. 

Now, I was 65 years old when that happened. My kids right now 
are good pilots, I was their instructor, all four of them, but I think 
with  the  lack  of  experience,  I’m  not  sure  that  they  would  have 
made it through an incident like that. There’s something good that 
can  be  said  about  experience.  I  had  occasion  to  fly  an  airplane 
around the world when I was over the legal age that we have today 
for  commercial  pilots,  and  a  lot  of  things  happened  on  that  trip 
that I had to draw upon a great deal of experience, so I just think 
that  the  arbitrary  age  doesn’t  work,  we  have  a  lot  of  people  who 
want  to  continue  to  work,  the  three  of  us  are  working,  the  four  of 
us are working past that age, and I think that we should allow oth-
ers to pursue their profession in the same way. They’re good pilots, 
they’re safe pilots and they’ve passed their tests. 

Senator  BURNS.  Congressman  Gibbons,  you  mentioned  countries 
that  allow  over-60  pilots.  Do  they  have  a  mandatory  cap  at  some 
point? 

Mr. GIBBONS. You know, I’m not sure. 
Senator BURNS. I’m just wondering. 
Mr.  GIBBONS.  I  don’t  know,  I  couldn’t  answer  that  and  tell  you 
with  certainty,  Senator,  because  I  have  not  looked  at  that  myself. 
Senator BURNS. OK, all right. Mighty fine. Do you have anything 

for this panel? 

You’re  invited  to  sit  up  here  and  join  us  during  this  hearing  if 
you  don’t  have  other  things  to  do.  We  have  an  interesting  line-up 
for  our  first  panel  will  be  Dr.  Jon  Jordan,  M.D.  for  Federal  Flight 
Surgeon,  Office  of  Aerospace  Medicine,  Federal  Aviation  Adminis-
tration  up  next,  so  you  might  want  to  stick  around,  so  you’re  in-
vited to join us, and thank you for your testimony today.

SURGEON,  OFFICE  OF  AEROSPACE  MEDICINE,  FEDERAL 
AVIATION ADMINISTRATION 
Dr.  JORDAN.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman,  members  of 
the Subcommittee. I’m Jon L. Jordan, I’m the Federal Air Surgeon 
for the Federal Aviation Administration. And I would like to thank 
you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today  to  discuss  the 
FAA’s  Age  60  Rule.  I  am  accompanied  today  by  my  colleague,  Jim 
Ballough, who is the Director of FAA’s Flight Standard Service. 

As  you  know,  the  Age  60  Rule  provides  that  a  pilot  may  not  en-
gage  in  what  are  known  as  Part  121  operations  if  the  pilot  has 
reached his or her 60th birthday. The Rule means that a pilot who 
reaches  age  60  must  leave  Part  121  operations,  but  it  does  not 
mean  that  he  or  she  can  no  longer  play  an  important  role  in  avia-
tion.  Many  pilots  continue  to  work  for  Part  121  airlines  in  the 
screening,  recruitment,  and  training  of  pilot  applicants,  service 
flight  engineers,  or  fly  in  non-Part  121  operations  or  become  flight 
instructors. Or, fortunately for us, the FAA, work as safety inspec-
tors. 

Since  its  adoption  in  1959,  the  FAA  has  reviewed  the  Age  60 
Rule  several  times  to  determine  whether  new  and  sufficient  evi-
dence exists to warrant a reconsideration of the regulation. In fact, 
our most recent empirical studies completed in 2004 shows some of 
the  results,  that  there  appears  to  be  a  relationship  between  pilot 
age  and  accident  rate.  The  consistency  of  these  findings  across 
three recent empirical studies, suggests that changes to the Age 60 
Rule should be approached cautiously. 

I  must  emphasize  that  before  making  any  change  to  a  safety 
rule,  the  FAA  must  be  satisfied  that  the  regulation  will  maintain 
or raise the current level of safety. What is clear to us from review-
ing public comments and relevant literature concerning the Age 60 
Rule  is  that  there  is  no  single  right  answer.  What  is  also  clear  is 
that  the  question  for  the  FAA  is  one  of  public  safety,  and  deter-
mining  acceptable  risk.  At  this  time  the  FAA  cannot  be  assured 
that  changing  the  Age  60  Rule  will  maintain  or  raise  the  level  of 
safety. 

At  some  age,  every  individual  reaches  a  level  of  increased  infir-
mity,  leading  to  decreased  reliability.  That  age  will  vary  from  per-
son  to  person,  but  cannot  yet  be  predicted  in  a  specific  individual. 
While science does not absolutely dictate the age of 60 for commer-
cial pilot retirement, that age is within the age range during which 
sharp increases in disease, mortality, and morbidity occur. 

Clearly, there is an anatomic, physiological, and cognitive decline 
associated  with  aging,  albeit  variable  in  severity  and  onset  among 
individuals.  There  is  no  absolute,  scientific  formula  that  may  be 
readily  applied.  But  it’s  indisputable  that,  as  pilots,  as  people  age, 
they  experience  more  illnesses  and  disorders,  and  suffer  more  cog-
nitive decline. Cardiovascular disease rises with age steeply, begin-
ning  between  ages  55  and  65,  and  while  mortality  has  dropped 
since 1960, cardiovascular disease remains the most frequent cause 
of death in pilots and the general population. With these increased 
incidents of cardiovascular disease in the older population, the risk 
for  unexpected  events  that  could  be  a  threat  to  safety  of  flight  is 
increased.  Cardiac  events,  such  as  heart  attacks  and  heart  failure,

for example, during flight, have continued to occur in low, but fair-
ly  consistent  numbers  over  the  years,  and  have  caused  general 
aviation accidents. 

Other health conditions are known to increase in incidents, or to 
become  more  complicated  with  aging.  Many  present  greater  dif-
ficulties  of  detection  and  risk  assessment  than  do  cardiovascular 
disease.  Among  these  are  cerebrovascular  disease,  malignancies, 
endocrine  dysfunction,  neurological  disorder,  psychiatric  disorders, 
including  depression,  a  decline  in  sensory  and  motor  capabilities. 
There  has  been  an  increasing  awareness  of  the  more  subtle,  ad-
verse  conditions  affecting  performance,  such  as  those  related  to 
cognitive functioning. 

The Age 60 Rule has served well as a regulatory limit in the U.S. 
In  our  view,  it  remains  the  best  determination  that  can  be  made 
of  a  time  when  a  general  decline  in  health-related  functions  and 
overall cognitive capabilities has reached a level where decrements 
in  a  pilot’s  performance  may  jeopardize  safety.  Repeated  reviews 
and studies have not provided sufficient information that would ad-
dress  our  concerns  about  changing  the  Rule.  In  addition,  several 
U.S. Courts of Appeals have reviewed the Age 60 Rule, and studies 
related  to  the  Rule.  Uniformly,  these  courts  have  denied  peti-
tioner’s challenges. Also, the FAA has invited the public to provide 
comments on the viability of the Age 60 Rule. The most recent com-
ment period was opened in September of 2002, in relation to a peti-
tion for exemption to the Rule filed by a coalition of U.S. pilots ap-
proaching age 60. 

Nearly  7,000  comments  were  submitted  during  the  month-long 
open  comment  period.  Overwhelmingly,  the  comments  favored  re-
taining  the  current  Age  60  Rule.  They  cited  safety  and  medical 
issues most often as reasons for retention of the current rule. 

Mr.  Chairman,  the  FAA  develops  regulations  in  the  context  of 
what is best for public safety. The FAA’s primary mission is ensur-
ing  the  safety  of  the  National  Airspace  System.  The  FAA  estab-
lishes  through  our  regulations,  basic  safety  standards  for  aircraft 
and  crew  members  that  would  ensure  the  safety  of  our  traveling 
public.  Modifying  the  longstanding  baseline  of  age  60  in  the  U.S., 
requires  that  the  public  be  shown  how  such  modification  would 
maintain  an  equivalent  level  of  safety.  None  of  the  studies  com-
pleted  since  implementation  of  the  Rule  provide  satisfactory  data 
that  conclusively  supports  changing  the  Rule.  Also,  I  should  note 
that no medical protocols exist to reliably predict when or whether 
an  over-age  60  pilot  might  experience  a  medical  event  that  will 
jeopardize  aviation  safety.  In  some,  with  inconclusive  data,  and  no 
practical  experience  with  pilots  above  age  60,  the  FAA  does  not 
agree  at  this  time  with  efforts  to  modify  the  current  age  limit  for 
commercial airline pilots. That concludes my prepared remarks, my 
colleague  and  I  will  be  happy  to  answer  any  questions  you  may 
have. 

Senator  BURNS.  Thank  you  very  much,  Dr.  Jordan,  and  I  might 
add  that  your  complete  statement,  or  any  other  information  that 
you want in the record, we’ll be happy to include those documents. 

[The prepared statement of Dr. Jordan follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JON L. JORDAN, M.D., J.D., FEDERAL AIR SURGEON, 

OFFICE OF AEROSPACE MEDICINE, FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION

Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee: 
I would like to thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss 
the  Federal  Aviation  Administration’s  (FAA)  Age  60  rule,  which  provides  that  a 
pilot  may  not  engage  in  what  are  known  as  Part  121  operations  if  the  pilot  has 
reached his 60th birthday. Part 121 covers operations of large commercial passenger 
aircraft,  smaller  propeller  aircraft  with  10  or  more  passenger  seats,  and  common 
carriage  operations  of  all-cargo  aircraft  with  a  payload  capacity  of  7,500  pounds.  I 
am  accompanied  today  by  my  colleague,  Jim  Ballough,  Director  of  FAA’s  Flight 
Standards Service. 

The Age 60 rule represents the FAA’s best determination of the time when a gen-
eral decline in health-related functions and overall cognitive and performance capa-
bilities  may  begin  and  reach  a  level  where  a  pilot’s  judgment  and  physical  ability 
may  begin  to  decline,  and  therefore  jeopardize  safety.  Our  rule  means  that  a  pilot 
who  reaches  age  60  must  leave  Part  121  operations,  but  it  does  not  mean  that  he 
or  she  can  no  longer  play  an  important  role  in  aviation.  Many  pilots  continue  to 
work for Part 121 airlines in the screening, recruitment, and training of pilot appli-
cants,  serve  as  flight  engineers,  or  fly  in  non-Part  121  operations,  or  become  flight 
instructors, or, fortunately for us, work as safety inspectors for the FAA. 

Since  its  adoption  in  1959,  the  FAA  has  reviewed  the  Age  60  rule  several  times 
to  determine  whether  new  and  sufficient  evidence  exists  to  warrant  a  reconsider-
ation of the regulation. The FAA has also successfully defended the Rule in several 
administrative and judicial challenges. 

FAA  has  conducted  five  studies  on  the  relationship  of  pilot  age  to  accidents  be-
tween  1999  and  2004.  The  first  four  studies  were  conducted  at  the  direction  of  the 
Senate Appropriations Committee, which requested in 1999 that the FAA study and 
provide  data  regarding  relative  accident  rates  based  on  pilot  age.  The  FAA’s  Civil 
Aerospace  Medical  Institute  (CAMI)  conducted  a  four-part  study.  The  four  studies 
were  as  follows:  (1)  an  annotated  bibliography  of  the  scientific  literature  (1990– 
1999);  (2)  a  re-analysis  of  the  Chicago  Tribune  study  data  (1999)  relating  pilot  age 
and accident rates; (3) an empirical analysis of accident rates by pilot age for profes-
sional  pilots  holding  Air  Transport  Pilot  (ATP)  and  Class  1  medical  certificates  be-
tween  1988  and  1997;  and  (4)  an  empirical  analysis  of  accident  rates  by  pilot  age 
for professional pilots holding ATP or Commercial Pilot and Class 1 or Class 2 med-
ical certificates between 1988 and 1997. 

Certain  aspects  of  the  analytic  methodology  used  in  the  third  and  fourth  studies 
were  criticized  in  the  open  scientific  literature.  In  response,  the  first  author  for 
those  studies,  Dr.  Dana  Broach  of  CAMI,  re-analyzed  the  accident  rate  data.  That 
study was published in 2004. The 2004 study used more restrictive criteria to select 
which  accidents  to  include  in  the  analysis  than  were  used  in  the  previous  studies. 
Taken together, the criteria resulted in an ‘‘apples-to-apples’’ comparison of accident 
rates for pilots age 60–63, and younger pilots in that the accident and non-accident 
pilots had the same credentials, worked for the same employers, and operated com-
plex,  multi-engine  commuter  or  larger  aircraft  now  covered  by  Part  121.  As  in  the 
previous  studies,  the  data  were  aggregated  by  age  group  (in  five-year  increments) 
and year, and analyzed with the same statistical technique. 

The  results  of  the  2004  study  were  similar  to  those  reported  in  the  third  and 
fourth  empirical  studies  previously  reported  to  Congress.  Overall,  accident  rate  in-
creased  with  pilot  age.  The  patterns  of  findings  across  the  three  empirical  studies 
are similar—there appears to be a relationship between pilot age and accident rate. 
The  consistency  of  this  finding  across  the  three  empirical  studies  suggests  that 
changes to the Age 60 rule should be approached cautiously. 

I must emphasize that before making any change to a safety rule, the FAA must 
be  satisfied  that  the  regulation  will  maintain  or  raise  the  current  level  of  safety. 
What  is  clear  to  us  from  reviewing  public  comments  and  relevant  literature  con-
cerning the Age 60 rule is that there is no single ‘‘right answer.’’ What is also clear 
is  that  the  question  for  the  FAA  is  one  of  public  safety  and  determining  acceptable 
risk.  At  this  time,  the  FAA  cannot  be  assured  that  changing  the  Age  60  rule  will 
maintain or raise the level of safety. 

At some age, every individual reaches a level of increased infirmity leading to de-
creased reliability. That age will vary from person to person but cannot yet be pre-
dicted  in  a  specific  individual.  While  science  does  not  absolutely  dictate  the  age  of 
60 for commercial passenger pilot retirement, that age is within the age range dur-
ing  which  sharp  increases  in  disease  mortality  and  morbidity  occur.  Clearly,  there 
is a progressive anatomic, physiological, and cognitive decline associated with aging,

9 

albeit  variable  in  severity  and  onset  among  individuals.  There  is  no  absolute,  sci-
entific formula that may be readily applied. 

It  is  indisputable  that,  as  people  age,  they  experience  more  illnesses  and  dis-
orders,  and  suffer  more  cognitive  decline.  Cardiovascular  disease  rises  with  age, 
steeply, beginning between ages 55 and 65, and, though mortality has dropped since 
1960, cardiovascular disease remains the most frequent cause of death in pilots and 
the  general  population.  With  this  increased  incidence  of  cardiovascular  disease  in 
the older population, the risk for unexpected events that could be a threat to safety 
of flight is increased. Cardiac events (e.g., heart attacks, heart failure) during flight 
have  continued  to  occur  in  low,  but  fairly  consistent  numbers  over  the  years,  and 
have caused general aviation accidents. 

Other  health  conditions  are  known  to  increase  in  incidence  or  to  become  more 
complicated  with  aging.  Many  present  greater  difficulties  of  detection  and  risk  as-
sessment  than  do  cardiovascular  disease.  Among  these  are  cerebrovascular  disease; 
malignancies;  endocrine  dysfunction;  neurological  disorders;  psychiatric  disorders, 
including depression; and decline in sensory and motor capabilities. There has been 
an  increasing  awareness  of  the  more  subtle  adverse  conditions  affecting  perform-
ance, such as those related to cognitive functioning. 

The  ‘‘Age  60  rule’’  has  served  well  as  a  regulatory  limit  in  the  United  States.  It 
remains the best determination that can be made of the time when a general decline 
in  health-related  functions  and  overall  cognitive  capabilities  has  reached  a  level 
where decrements in a pilot’s performance may jeopardize safety. The ‘‘Age 60 rule’’ 
has been repeatedly reviewed to determine whether new and sufficient evidence ex-
ists to warrant a reconsideration of the regulation. Studies conducted to date do not 
present sufficient information that would address concerns about negatively impact-
ing the current level of safety by changing the Rule. 

The  FAA  has  invited  the  public  to  provide  comments  on  the  viability  of  the  ‘‘Age 
60  rule.’’  The  most  recent  comment  period  was  opened  in  September  2002,  in  rela-
tion  to  a  petition  for  exemption  to  the  Rule  filed  by  a  coalition  of  U.S.  pilots  ap-
proaching  age  60.  Nearly  7,000  comments  were  submitted  during  the  month-long 
open comment period. Overwhelmingly, the comments favored retaining the current 
‘‘Age 60 rule.’’ They cited safety and medical issues most often as reasons for reten-
tion of the current rule. 

Several  U.S.  courts  of  appeals  have  reviewed  the  ‘‘Age  60  rule,’’  and  studies  re-
lated to the Rule. Uniformly, these courts have denied petitioners’ requests for relief 
from the Rule. In September 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Co-
lumbia Circuit refused to review FAA’s denial of a petition for exemptions from the 
Rule. In May 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear arguments on the same 
matter. 

In  recent  years,  several  bills  to  revise  the  age  limit  for  airliner  pilots  have  been 
introduced.  In  February  2001,  a  bill  to  modify  the  ‘‘Age  60  rule’’  by  increasing  the 
age limit to age 65, was referred to the House Subcommittee on Aviation. In March 
2001,  a  bill  to  modify  the  ‘‘Age  60  rule’’  to  age  63  was  favorably  reported  by  this 
committee.  Neither  bill  was  ultimately  enacted.  Most  recently,  legislation  was  pro-
posed  earlier  this  year  that  would  tie  an  age  limit  for  air  carrier  pilots  to  Social 
Security retirement-age eligibility. 

Modifying the long-standing baseline of age 60 in the U.S. requires that the public 
be  shown  how  such  modification  would  maintain  an  equivalent  level  of  safety.  The 
‘‘Age  60  rule’’  is  a  long-standing  operational  rule  that  pre-dates  subsequent  studies 
completed over the years. None of the studies completed since implementation of the 
Rule provide satisfactory data that conclusively supports changing the Rule. No pro-
tocols  exist  to  reliably  predict  when  or  whether  an  over-age-60  pilot  might  experi-
ence  a  medical  event  that  could  jeopardize  aviation  safety.  With  inconclusive  data 
and  no  practical  experience  with  pilots  above  age  60,  the  FAA  does  not  agree,  at 
this time, to modify the current age limit for airliner pilots. 

Mr.  Chairman,  the  FAA  will  develop  regulations  in  the  context  of  what  is  best 
for  public  safety.  The  FAA’s  primary  mission  is  ensuring  the  safety  of  the  National 
Airspace System. We work hard to manage a growth oriented aviation system—and 
the  constraints  on  the  system  that  growth  imposes—in  the  most  efficient  and  safe 
way  possible.  The  FAA  establishes,  through  our  regulations,  basic  safety  standards 
for aircraft and crewmembers that will ensure the safety of our traveling public. We 
construct  our  regulations  very  carefully,  taking  into  account  as  many  factors  as  we 
can,  but  ultimately,  always  making  the  decision  that  will  best  enhance  aviation 
safety. While economic factors are certainly a part of that calculation, I am sure the 
Committee  and  our  colleagues  in  industry  would  agree  that  safety  must  be  the  top 
priority. 

That  concludes  my  prepared  remarks.  I  would  be  happy  to  answer  any  questions 

the Committee may have.

STATEMENT OF RUSSELL B. RAYMAN, M.D., EXECUTIVE 

DIRECTOR, AEROSPACE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION 

Dr. RAYMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The  Aerospace  Medical  Association  appreciates  the  opportunity 
to  submit  this  statement  to  the  U.S.  Senate  Committee  on  Com-
merce,  Science,  and  Transportation,  Aviation  Subcommittee  on  the 
important issue of the Age 60 Rule for air transport pilots. 

I am Dr. Russell B. Rayman, Executive Director of the Aerospace 
Medical  Association,  representing  approximately  3,100  physicians, 
scientists,  and  flight  nurses  engaged  in  the  practice  of  aerospace 
medicine, or related research. 

The  Age  60  Rule  implemented  by  the  Federal  Aviation  Adminis-
tration  in  1959,  does  not  allow  persons  engaged  in  operations  con-
ducted under Part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to serve 
as a pilot or co-pilot on reaching their 60th birthday. The rule was 
implemented under the premise that the risk of incapacitation, due 
to medical causes after 60 years of age, was unacceptably high. 

Is  there  evidence  that  this  is  true  for  air  transport  pilots?  And 
is there evidence that aging causes a significant performance decre-
ment  in  the  cockpit?  Unfortunately,  there  is  no  clear  answer  to  ei-
ther of these questions. The reason being, that there are no studies 
of  air  transport  pilots  who  are  beyond  60  years  of  age,  simply  be-
cause none have ever been certified by the FAA. 

To answer these questions with reasonable certitude, it would be 
necessary to study a cohort of air transport pilots who are over age 
60 and to compare them with a cohort of air transport pilots below 
age  60.  Since  this  cannot  be  done  today,  the  only  alternative  is  to 
study  cohorts  of  general  aviation  and  commercial  pilots,  both  cat-
egories having no age limits. And, indeed, a number of such studies 
have  been  accomplished  and  published  in  the  literature.  However, 
the  conclusions  of  these  studies  are  vexing  in  their  inconsistencies 
and contradictions. Hence, they do not provide convincing evidence 
to support, or refute, the Age 60 Rule. 

In  any  event,  the  validity  of  these  studies  comes  into  question  if 
we  attempt  to  extrapolate  the  findings  derived  from  general  avia-
tion and commercial pilots to air transport pilots, because of signifi-
cant  differences  in  aircraft  and  operations.  This  represents  a  sig-
nificant flaw. 

We  believe,  the  Aerospace  Medical  Association,  believes  that 
some  pilots  beyond  age  60  could  continue  to  fly  without  an  added 
risk  to  flying  safety.  The  challenge  is  to  determine  which  ones 
could  be  safely  certified  and  which  ones  should  be  retired.  To  re-
solve  this  dichotomy,  studies  would  have  to  be  designed  to  deter-
mine  if,  and  what,  medical  tests  might  be  added  to  the  current 
FAA  flight  medical  examination  as  a  means  of  monitoring  the 
health  of  the  older  pilot.  Additional  studies  would  also  be  needed 
to  determine  how  older  pilots  might  be  tested  for  significant  per-
formance  decrement  in  the  cockpit.  Such  a  study  would  be 
daunting  in  terms  of  scientific  design  and  costs,  and  most  likely 
would  take  years  to  accomplish.  In  the  meanwhile,  we  would  sug-
gest that selected pilots be certified to an arbitrary age beyond age 
60, and closely monitored.

Although medical sudden incapacitation is always a possibility— 
and  I  might  add,  at  any  age—we  believe  there’s  a  vanishingly 
small  risk.  Even  if  there  were  such  an  occurrence,  there  is  always 
a second pilot in the cockpit. It might also be added that there has 
never  been  a  U.S.  air  carrier  accident  due  to  medical  causes.  And 
finally,  there  are  about  30  countries,  and  that  number—I  might 
add—is probably low, that permit air transport pilots to fly beyond 
age  60,  and  to  our  knowledge,  there  has  been  no  adverse  affect 
upon flying safety. 

In  conclusion,  on  review  of  the  existing  evidence,  the  Aerospace 
Medical Association concludes there is insufficient medical evidence 
to  support  restriction  of  pilot  certification  based  on  age  alone.  Al-
though  studies  could  be  designed  to  determine  which  pilots  could 
be  certified  to  safely  fly  beyond  age  60,  they  would  be  difficult  to 
design,  and  would  be  costly.  In  the  meanwhile,  we  would  rec-
ommend  that  selected  pilots  be  certified  to  fly  beyond  age  60,  and 
closely monitored. 
Thank you, sir. 
Senator  BURNS.  Thank  you.  Dr.  Jordan,  we’ve  made  significant 
gains  both  medically  and  technologically  over  the  last  few  years,  I 
was  just  looking  at  some  figures  the  other  day  of  just  100  years 
ago,  life  expectancy  was  47  years  old.  And,  of  course,  that  has 
steadily  increased,  I  think,  ever  since,  let’s  say,  World  War  I.  And 
there’s  a  growing  trend  among  foreign  aviation  authorities,  of 
course,  and  we  heard  the  testimony  from  Representative  Gibbons 
that they fly over the age of 60, and I’m wondering, have we looked 
at their records and made any comparisons? We know that over 60 
will  not,  maybe  it  will  not  increase  our  level  of  safety,  but  does  it 
decrease  according  to  European  records,  or  those  other  countries, 
that allow pilots to fly over 60 years old? 

Dr. JORDAN. Sir, I don’t know of any studies that have been con-
ducted  using  the  data  that  might  have  been  developed  by  the  for-
eign  carriers  that  do  permit  pilots  to  fly  over  age  60,  I  think  it’s 
mainly  anecdotal  and  observational  in  nature,  and  not  specific.  It 
won’t  really  provide  a  scientific  basis,  I  think,  for  concluding  that 
allowing pilots to fly over age 60 is appropriate. 

Senator  BURNS.  Does  the  FAA  grant  waivers  to  pilots  of  foreign 

carriers who are over 60? 

Dr. JORDAN. Yes, that’s correct. 
Senator  BURNS.  If  so,  why  do  you  accommodate  foreign  pilots, 

but the FAA has never granted an exemption to a U.S. pilot? 

Dr.  JORDAN.  It’s  a  matter  of  international  concern,  and  inter-
national law, sir. And our current process in terms of dealing with 
pilots  flying  into  the  U.S.  who  are  over  age  60,  is  that  according 
to  ICAO  rules,  a  pilot-in-command  must  be  under  age  60,  but  the 
first officer, for example, can be over age 60, or age 65. Because we 
follow  ICAO  rules,  we  do  not  permit  the  pilot-in-command  to  fly 
over  age  60,  but  we  do  permit  the  first  officer  to  fly  over  age  60. 
The first officer would not be in accordance with our rules. 

Senator BURNS. Senator Stevens, you have a question? 
Senator  STEVENS.  I’m  a  little  disturbed  by  that  last  comment,  I 
didn’t understand, Dr. Jordan—you let the first pilot come in if he’s 
over 65, but you don’t let a co-pilot come in if he’s over 65?

Dr. JORDAN. Well, the current ICAO rule provides that the pilot- 
in-command  must  be  under  age  60.  It’s  a  recommended  practice 
that  the  first  officer  be  under  age  60,  and  because  it’s  a  rec-
ommended practice, the Agency does permit pilots to come into the 
country  who  are  over  age  60,  but  the  pilot-in-command  has  to  be 
under age 60, it’s enforced by the Agency. 

Senator STEVENS. You do the same thing for Britain? 
Dr. JORDAN. Yes, sir. 
Senator STEVENS. Is there any country that has an age limit that 

you do not accept? 

Dr. JORDAN. Would you repeat that, Senator? 
Senator  STEVENS.  Is  there  any  country  that  has  an  age  limit,  I 
take it would be over 65, that you do not accept? Are there any in 
civil aviation that are over 65? 

Dr.  JORDAN.  Well,  the  rules  would  apply  equally  no  matter  who 
the  carrier  flies  for,  the  company  that  they  fly  for.  It’s  going  to  be 
applied evenly across the board. 

Senator STEVENS. Did I hear you express reservation about those 

who are over 60 having qualifications to fly? 

Dr. JORDAN. The Age 60 Rule is a somewhat arbitrary or discre-
tionary rule, and I think there are those individuals that are prob-
ably OK, the problem is in determining who is, and who is not, all 
right for flying over age 60. 

Senator  STEVENS.  I’m  82  this  year,  I  think  I’m  in  better  shape 
than  I  was  when  I  was  60.  I  can  run  faster,  play  better  tennis, 
swim better, I’m in better shape, 25 pounds less—aren’t the factors 
that you’re talking about related to overall health, rather than age? 
Dr.  JORDAN.  It  would  be  preferable  to  do  that,  but  I  know  of  no 

protocol that could be used to make those kinds of distinctions. 

Senator  STEVENS.  But  what  I’m  saying  is  those  who  you’re  talk-
ing  about  in  terms  of  being  questionable,  over  60,  don’t  they  have 
other  health  factors,  other  than  age,  that  would  lead  them  to  be 
disqualified? 

Dr.  JORDAN.  I’m  not  sure  I  follow  the  question,  Senator,  could 

you rephrase that? 

Senator STEVENS. You’re questioning anyone that’s over 60 being 

healthy enough to fly, aren’t you? 

Dr.  JORDAN.  I’m  still  having  a  little  trouble  understanding,  you 

said people over age 60 are healthy enough to fly? 

Senator  STEVENS.  My  understanding  of  what  you’ve  testified  is 
that  those  over  the  age  of  60  have  some  question  as  to  whether 
they should be allowed to fly, am I misunderstanding you? 

Dr.  JORDAN.  No,  I  think  that’s  correct,  I  think  anyone  over  age 
60—the  problem  is  we  don’t,  we’re  unable  to  sort  out  those  who 
might be healthy enough to fly from those who are not. 

Senator STEVENS. And my question to you is, is that age-related, 

or just health-related, over 60? 

Dr. JORDAN. Well, it’s the Age 60 Rule, so it’s age-related? 
Senator  STEVENS.  I’m  asking  you  as  a  doctor,  forget  about  the 
Rule.  People  over  60—are  you  saying  that  they  tend  to  be 
unhealthy,  so  that  they  shouldn’t  be  able  to  fly  as  a  commercial 
pilot? 

Dr.  JORDAN.  I  think  the  problem  is  knowing  who  can  and  who 

should not fly over age 60.

Senator  STEVENS.  It  seems  to  me  what  you’re  saying  is  the  rule 
is the rule and you’re going to support the Rule, I’m asking you as 
a doctor whether you agree with that rule? 

Dr.  JORDAN.  I  believe  that  there  has  to  be  some  arbitrary  age 
limit  for  pilots.  Whether  or  not  it  be  age  60,  or  63,  or  65,  or  55, 
I think is a matter of discretion. 
Senator STEVENS. Thank you. 
Senator  BURNS.  I  have  one  question  for  Dr.  Rayman—are  there 
other  experts  in  the  medical  and  scientific  field—I  guess  this  the 
question—that  share  your  views  on  the  Age  60  Rule?  And  have 
there  been  no  independent  studies  or  analysis  to  refute  the  FAA’s 
justification for keeping this rule? 

Dr. RAYMAN. Well, as I said, sir, the studies that have been pub-
lished  were  dealing  with  pilots  that  are  not  air  transport  pilots, 
and  we  consider  that  a  flaw.  But,  the  Association,  which  I  rep-
resent,  takes  a  stand  that  the  age  for  air  transport  pilots  could  be 
raised  to  another  arbitrary  age  above  age  60.  That  is  the  official 
position of our organization. 

Senator  BURNS.  Would  you  suggest  that—and  I  would  ask  that, 
if  the  Rule  was  removed—would  you  suggest  a  physical  twice  a 
year, rather than the once a year that’s required now? 

Dr.  RAYMAN.  I  think  if  the  Rule  was  removed,  it  would  probably 
be  an  operational  decision  and  not  a  medical  decision,  but  we 
would be very willing to work with whatever body that deliberates 
this issue to determine if more medical tests should be added—per-
haps some should—some countries don’t add any tests, they just in-
crease the maximum age to 65 and require no further exams, other 
than  the  routine  exam.  We’d  be  willing  to  work  with  any  delibera-
tive  body  to  determine  if  we  ought  to  add  more  tests  to—medical 
tests,  that  is—or  tests  of  cognition,  or  tests  of  motor  function.  I 
haven’t  a  prepared  answer  for  you  on  this  which  tests  should  be 
selected, if any, but there’s a possibility that we would recommend 
no further testing. 

Senator  BURNS.  I  find  it  odd  that  if  other  countries  allow  their 
pilots  to  fly  over  the  age  of  60  that  there  isn’t  some  sort  of  a 
record—not only with their health, but their safety record—as com-
pared, say, to people that are flying between 55 and the age of 60. 
Dr.  RAYMAN.  Well,  as  you’ve  heard  Senator,  there  are  a  number 
of pilots flying for other airlines, but I have seen nothing published 
regarding  a  study  of  their  health  status,  or  how  well  they  fared.  I 
do know I’ve seen no studies or no reports that indicate that these 
older pilots are unsafe. 

Senator  BURNS.  Dr.  Jordan,  are  there  age  restrictions  on  any 

other modes of transportation? 

Dr. JORDAN. Not that I’m aware of, sir, no. 
Senator  BURNS.  Have  you  got  another  question?  Ask  your  ques-

tion, Senator. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  let  me—both  Dr.  Jordan  and  Dr. 
Rayman,  here’s  my  problem—I  come  from  a  state  where  there  are 
very few buses and roads. Over 75 percent of our towns, cities and 
villages can be reached only by air. We have Part 121 planes, they 
are  subject  to  the  Age  60  Rule,  Part  135  is  not.  There’s  no  limit 
at  all  on  being  a  commercial  pilot  in  Part  135.  Now,  they’re  flying 
to  the  same  places,  along  comes  the  FAA  and  says,  ‘‘We  want  you 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:28 Jan 14, 2011 Jkt 063516 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\63516.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

14 

to  help  us  transition  the  Part  135s  into  Part  121s  because  they’re 
safer.  They’re  safer  to  fly,  Part  121s.’’  And  we’re  doing  that,  the 
Postal Service asked us to do that. Ten thousand pilots in my state, 
there  are  750  of  them  that  are  truly  commercial  in  the  sense  of 
being multi-engine commercial operators. Fifty percent of them are 
over  55—fifty  percent  of  all  pilots  in  Alaska  are  over  55.  Now,  the 
bulk  of  the  aircraft  are  owned  by  people  doing  some  type  of  com-
mercial  work.  I  don’t  understand  a  Rule  that  says,  pretty  soon 
we’re not going to have enough pilots to fly our planes. And I’m try-
ing  to  find  out  what  the  justification  is  for  the  FAA  to  keep  this 
rule  on  us,  at  the  same  time  as  they’re  telling  us,  ‘‘Try  to  move 
your people out of the Part 135 operations into Part 121.’’ 

Now, have you ever done any studies of those people that are fly-
ing the Part 135s that are over-age, and determined whether their 
accident  records  were  related  to  age  or  either  medical  conditions? 
Dr. JORDAN. Yes, sir, several studies have been done, the results 
of  those  studies  are  somewhat  conflicting.  Studies  done  by  Civil 
Aerospace Medical Institute in Oklahoma City, would tend to indi-
cate that the accident rate does increase in those operations, based 
upon age. There is at least one outside study that I’m aware of that 
would tend to indicate that the accident rate does not increase with 
age  for  those  pilots.  Those  studies  vary,  because  the  cohorts  that 
are  used  in  determining  how  the  research  should  proceed,  factors 
related  to  what  licenses  the  airmen  hold,  what  classes  of  medical 
certificates,  and  precisely  what  operations  they’re  involved  in.  And 
I think that has led to a great deal of confusion in terms of wheth-
er there is an increase in accidents in that population. I think over-
all that there probably is. 

Senator  STEVENS.  The  Part  135  pilots  and  Part  121  pilots  take 

the same physical, for commercial operations. 

Dr.  JORDAN.  Yes,  they  do,  but  they’re  involved  in  different  oper-

ations. 

Senator  STEVENS.  That’s  my  point,  too,  the  aircrafts  in  Part  135 
may not be as safe and as modern as the Part 121s are, and we’re 
trying  to  transition  there,  but  as  we  transition  there,  we’ve  got  a 
60  year  age  limit.  We’re  going  to  lose  50  percent  of  our  pilots  be-
cause they’re over 55 within 5 years. I think this bill means a great 
deal more to my state than anyone else. 

What would it take to get some type of studies that you all would 
rely  on  in  terms  of  determining  whether  this  rule  makes  total 
sense from a medical point of view? 

Dr. JORDAN. Over the years a number of studies have been done, 
but  they  don’t  seem  to  provide  us  the  answers  we  need  to  make 
those changes. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  what  are  the  questions  you  don’t  have 

the answers to? 

Dr.  JORDAN.  Well,  the  questions  that  we  don’t  have  the  answers 
to are in relationship to accidents, I think in those particular oper-
ations,  the  Part  121  operations,  and  this  is  largely  an  outgrowth 
of  the  Rule  itself,  because  we  don’t  permit  individuals  to  fly  those 
operations  after  age  60.  So  those,  you  have  to  use  surrogate  data, 
which  are  data  from  air  taxi  operations,  private  operations,  those 
data  have  been  used  in  the  past,  and  unfortunately,  by-and-large,

most of those studies indicated that accidents do increase with age. 
And age 60 seems to be the break-point. 

Senator STEVENS. Then why don’t you apply it to Part 135 planes 

that carry people commercially? 

Dr.  JORDAN.  We  do  apply  it  to  Part,  well,  Part  135  operations 
being  operated  under  Part  121  rules,  which  include  aircraft  of  ten 
or  more  seats,  all  of  those  operations  fly  under  Part  121  rules  and 
are  subjected  to  the  Age  60  Rule.  But  the  smaller  operations,  the 
age  limits  do  not  apply.  And  I  think  it’s  a  matter  of  where  you 
draw the line. 

Senator STEVENS. More than nine seats, you mean? 
Dr. JORDAN. Yes. 
Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  no  offense,  but  this  is  a  conundrum—10 
years  ago,  or  even  longer—I  remember  sitting  at  the  table  with 
Barry  Goldwater,  a  similar  hearing  back  when  he  was  here  that, 
what, didn’t have the pressure on us now, Alaska, that it does now, 
because  our  pilots  are  aging,  and  they’re  not  coming  up  to  fly  the 
way they used to in terms of younger pilots coming into Alaska for 
these operations. I think something has to be done. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman. 

Senator  BURNS.  Dr.  Rayman,  we’ve  been  joined  with  Senator 
Pryor in the Committee, Senator Pryor, do you have a question for 
this  panel,  these  are  the  physicians  that  are  in  charge,  Aerospace 
Medicine for the Federal Aviation Administration, do you have any 
questions for these folks? 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 

Senator  PRYOR.  I  do,  Mr.  Chairman,  if  they’ve  answered  your 

Senator  BURNS.  And  if  you  have  a  statement,  I’d  sure  put  it  in 

questions. 

the record for you. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you, I don’t have a statement. 
Senator BURNS. You have the floor. 
Senator PRYOR. Thank you. 
I’m sorry I was late joining this meeting, Mr. Chairman, and the 
panel, but let me just say this, and maybe this is what Senator Ste-
vens  was  referring  to  as  well.  The  60  year  rule  in  my  view,  has  a 
degree,  at  least,  of  arbitrariness  to  it.  Can  you  all  walk  through 
with  me,  if  possible,  what  is  so  magic  about  age  60?  If  I  could 
just— 

Dr. JORDAN. Well, sir, I don’t think that there is magic to age 60, 
I  think  it  is  an  age  at  which  individuals  appear  to  be  developing 
more frequently, the medical problems that could cause sudden, or 
even subtle incapacitation, a deterioration in cognitive performance 
that  may  become  problematic  from  a  safety  perspective,  but  there 
is a certain amount of arbitrariness or discretion related to age 60, 
as I mentioned in earlier testimony, some individuals deteriorate in 
terms of performance and develop medical problems well before age 
60, but it seems like it is a logical point at which, with the discre-
tionary  approach  that  you  would  say  that  an  individual  should  no 
longer  serve  in  the  highly  safety-sensitive  responsibilities,  particu-
larly in the piloting of aircraft.

Senator PRYOR. Do you all have anything to add to that? Do you 

have anything to add to that? 

Dr.  RAYMAN.  In  a  word,  I  would  say  that  any  age  that  we  select 
today is arbitrary. You won’t find any studies that will convince ev-
erybody  what  the  proper  age  should  be.  If  you  really  want  to  find 
out  the  proper  age,  you  have  to  do  a  whole  bunch  of  studies,  and 
these studies would take years to do and would cost a lot of money, 
and  would  be  very  difficult  to  design.  In  the  meanwhile,  we  would 
suggest  that  pilots,  once  they  reach  the  age  of  60,  be  permitted  to 
continue flying beyond age 60, albeit it would be another arbitrary 
age,  whichever  one  is  selected,  whether  it’s  sixty-three,  four,  five, 
or  whatever.  We  feel  that  there’s  very  little  risk  in  taking  this 
course of action, and these older pilots could be monitored for some 
period  of  time,  and  if  we  do,  indeed,  find  that  there  are  no  safety 
problems, then more and more pilots could be added on, beyond age 
60, and perhaps the arbitrary age could even be lifted even higher. 
Senator  PRYOR.  And  I  guess  what  both  of  you  are  saying  is  that 
it  really  is  an  individual  test  in  a  sense  that  for  some  people,  60 
is  not  as  old  as  it  is  for  other  people  in  terms  of  physical  abilities 
and  mental  abilities,  et  cetera,  I  mean,  that’s  what  my  life  experi-
ence tells me, anyway. 

Let me ask you both about the International Civil Aviation Orga-
nization,  I  think  they  call  that  ICAO?  Is  that  the  acronym,  is 
ICAO,  which  is  spelled  I-C-A-O,  but  nevertheless,  they  looked  at 
the  age  60  matter  in  December  of  this  past  year,  and  they  rec-
ommended proposing a change in the current standards that would 
raise the age limit for pilots to 65 in multi-crew situations, are you 
familiar with this, Senator Stevens? 

Senator STEVENS. That is the European rule. 
Senator  PRYOR.  Yes,  65  in  multi-crew  situations,  with  a  second 
pilot age 60 or under, I guess, under age 60, and in addition, those 
over  60  would  require  medical  assessment  every  6  months,  which 
I  assume  is  more  frequently,  probably  they  would  do  an  annual 
exam  now,  I  would  guess,  and  they’d  recommend  if  you’re  over  60 
that you do it every 6 months. 

Dr. JORDAN. Currently in the U.S., pilots are, in air carrier oper-
ations,  there’s  a  pilot-in-command,  who  must  be  examined  at  6 
month intervals. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Six  months,  now,  in  the  U.S.,  for  a  pilot-in-com-

mand. 

Dr. JORDAN. That’s correct. 
Senator  PRYOR.  OK,  and  so,  Mr.  Jordan  if  I  can,  what  are  your 

opinions of the ICAO recommendations? 

Dr.  JORDAN.  Well,  you  know,  I  think  it’s  the  selection  of  a  dif-
ferent,  somewhat  arbitrary  age  limit  for  certain  pilots  in  the  cock-
pit,  and  I  think  that  ICAO,  and  actually  what’s  being  proposed  by 
ICAO mirrors what’s going on, I think, with the Joint Aviation Au-
thority  in  the  European  countries.  Because  those  countries,  or  at 
least some of those countries, have gone to age 65, but again, that’s 
arbitrarily selected. And without good, scientific foundation, I think 
that, perhaps, ICAO and the European countries are hedging their 
bets,  so  to  speak,  by  requiring  the  other  pilot  in  the  operation  be 
under age 60, so they’re very tentatively, I think, changing the po-

17 

sition  on  age  60.  I  do  need  to  point  out  that  ICAO  has  not  yet 
adopted this rule. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Right,  that’s  a  recommendation  that  they’ve  re-

ceived. Right. 

Dr. Rayman, do you have a comment on the ICAO approach? 
Dr. RAYMAN. We would be in favor of it. 
Senator  PRYOR.  Let  me  ask  this,  too,  and  this  will  be  the  last 
question, is—just medically speaking—the fact that life expectancy 
is growing, people are living longer, more active longer, on average, 
does that factor in and of itself, does that mean that we should ex-
amine  the  Age  60  Rule?  Should  we  consider,  as  life  expectancy 
grows,  that  we  maybe  should  go  to  62  or  65,  I  mean,  is  that—or 
does  that  matter  at  all?  Does  life  expectancy  have  a  bearing  on 
this? 

Dr.  JORDAN.  Well,  you  know,  I  think  life  expectancy,  of  course, 
increased  life  expectancy  that  we’re  experiencing,  at  least  in  the 
United  States  and  other  developed  countries,  is  very  encouraging 
for  all  of  us,  but  we  still  have  to  contend  with  diseases  that  occur 
at  earlier  ages,  and  cardiovascular  disease,  neurological  disorders, 
psychiatric  disorders,  cognitive  performance  is  also  problematic  as 
an  individual  ages.  Those  things  have  really  not  changed.  What 
has  changed,  I  think  is  the  delivery  of  healthcare  in  advanced  na-
tions,  more  methodologies  for  treatment  of  various  conditions, 
whether surgical, medicinal, or otherwise, and I think that has con-
tributed  substantially  to  prolonging  the  life  of  people  in  developed 
countries. 

Senator  PRYOR.  So,  I  guess  what  you’re  saying  is,  the  fact  that 
people  are  living  longer,  doesn’t  necessarily  mean  they’re  more  ca-
pable of flying aircraft beyond age 60? 
Dr. JORDAN. Yes, sir, that’s correct. 
Senator PRYOR. Dr. Rayman? 
Dr.  RAYMAN.  Well,  I  would  agree  with  what  you  just  said,  cer-
tainly people are living longer, but as I said in my testimony, some 
individuals, pilots, could fly safely—we believe—beyond age 60, and 
some probably should be retired, and the challenge is to determine 
which ones are which, and that’s our great challenge. 

Senator PRYOR. Right. 
Mr. Chairman, that’s all I have, thank you. 
Senator BURNS. Thank you very much. I was just reminded here, 
Senator Stevens, as a reminder, controllers have an age limit of 56, 
is that correct, Dr. Jordan? 

Dr. JORDAN. That’s correct, currently, yes. 
Senator  BURNS.  Now,  they  have  been  granted  waivers  after  ex-

tensive physical and psychological tests, is that correct? 

Dr.  JORDAN.  Not  so  much  medical  or  psychological  testing,  no,  I 
think  they’ve  been  granted  waivers  based  upon  performance,  and 
observations of performance, those controllers that are able to work 
very  busy  sectors  and  seem  to  do  so  proficiently,  those  controllers 
who are not out sick frequently, those controllers who are not prob-
lem employees, so there are a lot of criteria that are being used to 
grant those exceptions, but they are not medically based. 

Senator BURNS. Thank you, that’s sort of interesting, and I think 
it sort of lends to the statement of Senator Stevens as maybe they 
should  base,  if  they  fly  over  60,  it  should  be  based  on  the  health

of the pilot, rather than on the age. It would seem like that would 
lend a pretty strong support to his statement. 

Dr.  JORDAN.  Again,  I  don’t  think  those  decisions  are  currently 
based,  except  in  a  peripheral  way,  on  the  medical  status  of  the  in-

Senator BURNS. But the same could be said about the proficiency 
of  the  pilot,  the  individual  pilot  may  be  a  check  ride,  or  whatever, 
we  could  make  those  determinations,  or  whatever.  So,  I  have  no 
other  questions  for  this  panel,  I  want  to  thank  you  for  your  testi-
mony, though, it’s important that we have it, and I would imagine 
there  will  be  questions  from  other  members  of  this  committee,  if 
they’re  submitted,  could  you  respond  to  the  Committee  and  to  the 
individual Senator? We thank you today. 

Our  second  panel  is  Captain  Duane  Woerth,  President,  Air  Line 
Pilots  Association  International,  Captain  Joseph  Eichelkraut, 
President,  Southwest  Airlines  Pilots’  Association,  Captain  Ralph 
Hunter,  President  of  Allied  Pilots  Association,  and  Captain  Al 
Spain,  Senior  Vice  President  of  Operations,  JetBlue  Airways  Cor-
poration.  So,  we  welcome  you  gentlemen  to  the  Committee  today, 
and  we  look  forward  to  having  your  testimony  and  respond  to  our 
questions. 

I first call on a familiar face, he’s been before this committee be-
fore,  and  I  thank  him  for  coming,  Captain  Duane  Woerth,  Presi-
dent  of  the  Air  Line  Pilots  Association,  International.  Thank  you 
for coming. 

STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN DUANE E. WOERTH, PRESIDENT, 
AIR LINE PILOTS ASSOCIATION, INTERNATIONAL (ALPA) 
Mr.  WOERTH.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  My  name  is  Duane 
Woerth,  I  am  the  President  of  the  Air  Line  Pilots  Association, 
International and our union is the largest pilot union in the world, 
it represents more than 64,000 airline pilots of 41 carriers, and it’s 
an  honor  to  be  before  your  committee  today  to  address  this  Rule. 
The Federal Regulation that restricts airline pilots from flying as 
captains and first officers in Part 121 operations is one of the most 
historically  contentious  issues  inside  the  pilot  community.  For 
every  strongly  held  opinion  that  this  rule  must  be  changed,  there 
is an equally strong opinion that it remains the same. 

As many of you already know, our Association recently completed 
the most comprehensive information campaign and member survey 
that  our  union  has  ever  concluded  on  a  single  issue  and,  by  the 
way  Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  copies  of  all  of  the  information  and  the 
survey,  if  you’d  like  copies  of  that  I  would  submit  it  for  the  record 
if any Senator wants that. 

The  results  of  that  survey  were  presented  to  the  leaders  of  our 
41  pilot  groups  known  as  our  Executive  Board  for  discussion,  and 
their discussion led to the unanimous vote to simply accept the re-
ported  results.  No  matter  their  personal  views  on  the  issue  or  the 
views  within  the  pilot  community,  the  ALPA  Executive  Board 
agreed  that  the  information  campaign  had  been  exhaustive  and 
balanced,  that  the  members  understood  the  issues  at  stake,  and 
that  the  survey  results  were  clear  and  accurate.  While  the  survey 
confirmed  that  our  membership  is  split—I  will  emphasize  that,  we 
have  a  split  membership  on  this  issue—a  clear  majority  did  mani-

fest  itself.  Therefore,  the  Air  Line  Pilots  Association,  today,  re-
mains opposed to changing the Age 60 Rule. 

19 

So,  what  exactly  did  our  pilots  tell  us?  Let  me  share  just  a  few 
of  the  statistic  nuggets  gleaned  from  the  survey,  which  has  less 
than a 1-percent margin of error. When asked in a straightforward 
‘‘yes or no’’ format, 56 percent of ALPA pilots opposed changing the 
Rule,  42  percent  want  to  change  it.  When  we  asked  pilots  specifi-
cally  about  changing  the  age  to  65,  support  for  maintaining  the 
current rule actually rose to 58 percent, and support dropped to 39 
percent.  When  asked  about  the  support  for  additional  operational 
or medical requirements, should the Rule be changed, results indi-
cate  the  opposite,  rather  the  opposition  to  the  Rule  would  actually 
grow  into  the  mid-sixties.  Only  29  percent  support  additional  or 
more stringent medical exams, and a mere 23 percent support more 
line  or  simulator  checks.  And  only  22  percent  support  additional 
operational restrictions, should the Age 60 Rule change. 

In  a  separate  survey  we  conducted  earlier  in  the  year,  on  prior-
ities  for  ALPA,  we  asked  pilots  to  rank  legislative  issues  in  order 
of  importance,  as  you  said  Mr.  Chairman,  we’ve  been  before  your 
committee  for  many  issues.  At  the  top  of  the  list  were  issues  the 
pilots  wanted  us  to  fight  strongest  against—opposing  foreign  sabo-
tage, passing pension legislation, restricting foreign ownership, and 
promoting general aviation issues. 

The  bottom  of  the  list  was  changing  the  Age  60  Rule,  second 
from  the  bottom  was  keeping  it  the  same.  After  all  that  our  pilots 
have  been  through—terrorism,  bankruptcy,  furloughs,  pay  cuts, 
work  world  changes—a  majority,  a  small  majority,  still  believes 
that this rule works. 

If you had asked me one year ago to predict what I would be say-
ing  today,  I  would  have  predicted  that  a  majority  of  ALPA  mem-
bers  would  have  moved  to  the  other  side.  That’s  why,  one  of  the 
reasons, we went through all this elaborate survey, because we felt 
with  the  terrible  loss  of  pension  benefits—and  many  of  the  pilots 
in  this  room  today  have  lost  their  pensions—with  all  of  the  deep 
pay  cuts  we  have  suffered,  I  was  convinced  that  the  membership 
was  probably  going  to  vote  the  other  way.  As  it  turns  out—we  did 
not,  incidentally,  include  our  furloughed  pilots—5,000  furloughed 
pilots—who  might  have  been  expected  to  vote  strongly  to  keep  the 
Rule—we  didn’t  do  that,  but  in  spite  of  that  there  was  a  majority 
who want to keep the Rule. 

In my formal testimony, I have included a litany of medical stud-
ies,  court  decisions,  and  previous  Congressional  actions  to  build  a 
strong case for keeping the Rule. I will not elaborate on them here 
today,  but  I  think  much  of  what  has  been  said  holds  true.  There 
are a lot of pilots who would like a separate physical for them that 
would make that test. Today the FAA says they can’t do it, or they 
haven’t done it, or it’s too costly. 

Furthermore,  no  safety  rule  operates  in  a  vacuum,  or  is  isolated 
from  the  rest  of  the  world’s  operating  environment  we  face  in  the 
first  years  of  the  21st  century—mind-numbing  pilot  fatigue,  and 
the  mental  errors  it  leads  to  are  still  one  of  the  largest  threats  to 
aviation safety. Sixteen hour domestic duty days—even longer with 
trans-Pacific  operations  are  facts  of  life  for  airline  pilots.  Irregular

shifts,  all-night  operations,  and  significant  circadian-living  chal-
lenges all contribute to pilot fatigue. 

20 

Airline  piloting  is  an  occupation  that  is  physically  punishing.  A 
significant  percentage  of  airline  pilots  do  not  make  it  now  to  age 
60. I’d like to cite a Northwest Airlines example you often meet in 
the  World  Club  as  we  head  out  to  Minneapolis  and  Montana— 
that’s  my  alma  mater,  by  the  way—and  43  percent,  we’ve  been 
doing  a  check  of  every  single  pilot  who’s  retired  from  Northwest 
Airlines since 1993. Forty-three percent of the pilots retired do not 
retire at 60, they retire before 60, either with disabilities, or volun-
tarily early. 

Now,  with  all  of  the  contract  award  concessions  that  have  oc-
curred since September 11, especially at our legacy airlines, a high-
er  percentage  of  pilots  are  flying  more  hours,  working  more  days, 
with  longer  duty  periods  than  any  other  time  in  recent  history. 
Nonetheless,  some  air  carriers  want  to  increase  pilot  flight  and 
duty time limitations. At least one air carrier who advocates chang-
ing  the  Age  60  Rule,  wants  this  pilot  to  fly  from  the  East  Coast 
to  the  West  Coast  and  back,  all  within  one  duty  period.  Now,  cur-
rent  safety  rules  would  have  to  be  waived  to  permit  this.  I  think 
airline  managements  who  advocate  changing  the  Age  60  Rule 
should  put  all  of  their  cards  on  the  table,  and  tell  us  what  other 
safety regulations they’d like to change, since we’re not going to do 
this in a vacuum. 

Now,  no  matter  what  this  committee  or  the  full  Senate  may  de-
cide  to  do  with  the  Age  60  Rule,  the  current  flight  and  duty  time 
rules  affecting  pilot  fatigue  need  to  be  enhanced,  not  weakened. 
Mr.  Chairman,  I  believe  this  issue  of  pilot  fatigue  is  one  of  those 
issues that your committee might want to tackle this year. 

As  to  international  standards  as  to  the  Age  60  Rule—there  are 
some  who  cherry-pick  the  facts  and  point  to  several,  or  many,  Eu-
ropean  nations  that  have  carved  out  exceptions  to  ICAO’s  age  60 
standards.  The  fact  remains  that  the  most  retirement  ages  in  Eu-
rope are governed by contractual language between airlines and pi-
lots’  unions.  The  regulatory  standard  in  France  and  Italy  remains 
at 60, the Dutch airline, KLM, pilots have negotiated a retirement 
age of 56, at British Airways, that age is 55. 

Let’s  be  clear  about  this—the  state  licensing  standard  has  been 
raised  to  65  throughout  almost  all  of  Europe.  However,  the  over-
whelming  majority  of  airline  pilots  within  Europe  still  retired  be-
fore  60,  I  think  that  explains  some  of  the  questions  you  had  that 
were kind of self-evident, why aren’t there a lot of pilots—most pi-
lots still retire under contracts below 60, even though the licensing 
standard has been changed as you’ve noted, and others have noted, 
to 65 within Europe. 

At  any  rate,  you  invited  me  to  hear  data  to  offer  the  pilots  pro-
fession’s perspective on the Age 60 Rule. As is done with any trans-
parent,  representative  organization  should  do  when  faced  with  a 
very controversial issue—and believe me, this is as controversial as 
it gets inside our union. We’ve learned about it, we’ve talked about 
it,  we’ve  asked  our  members,  recorded  from  this  fine  profession 
what they believe, the results are in, and we do have a majority— 
although  a  small  majority—who  still  want  to  maintain  the  Rule. 
Thank you for inviting me to this committee’s hearing.

[The prepared statement of Captain Woerth follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN DUANE E. WOERTH, PRESIDENT, 

AIR LINE PILOTS ASSOCIATION, INTERNATIONAL (ALPA) 

Good  afternoon,  Mr.  Chairman  and  members  of  the  Committee.  I  am  Duane 
Woerth,  President  of  the  Air  Line  Pilots  Association,  International  (ALPA).  Our 
union—the largest pilot union in the world—represents more than 64,000 airline pi-
lots  at  41  carriers.  On  behalf  of  ALPA,  I  appreciate  the  invitation  to  appear  before 
the Committee today to present ALPA’s views on the mandatory retirement age for 
airline  pilots  as  specified  under  the  FAA  regulation  commonly  known  as  the  ‘‘Age 
60 Rule.’’ 

The  Federal  regulation  that  restricts  airline  pilots  from  flying  as  captains  and 
first officers in Part 121 operations is one of the most historically contentious issues 
among  the  pilot  community.  For  every  strongly  held  opinion  that  this  rule  must  be 
changed,  an  equally  strong  opinion  holds  that  it  remain  the  same.  As  many  of  you 
already  know,  our  Association  recently  completed  the  most  comprehensive  informa-
tion  campaign  and  member  survey  that  our  union  has  ever  conducted  on  a  single 
issue.  The  results  of  that  survey  were  presented  for  discussion  to  our  Executive 
Board, which is made up of the leaders of our 41 pilot groups. 

Their  discussion  led  to  a  unanimous  vote  to  accept  the  reported  results,  leaving 
our  policy  on  the  Rule  intact.  No  matter  their  personal  views  on  the  issue,  or  the 
views  within  their  own  pilot  communities,  the  ALPA  Executive  Board  agreed  that 
the information campaign had been exhaustive and balanced, that our members un-
derstood  the  issues  at  stake,  and  that  the  survey  results  were  clear  and  accurate. 
Their unanimity makes it possible for me to state for the record today that the Air 
Line  Pilots  Association  opposes  changing  the  Age  60  Rule,  as  we  have  since  1980. 
Results of the ALPA Age 60 Survey 

Since  September  2004,  when  we  began  this  initiative,  our  members  have  consid-
ered  the  issue  from  many  angles,  weighed  the  evidence,  and  expressed  their  views 
on  the  Age  60  Rule  candidly  and  forthrightly.  The  assessment  of  ALPA  members’ 
views  is  based  on  two  studies  with  identical  questionnaires.  The  first  was  a  tele-
phone  poll  conducted  from  March  30  through  April  4.  The  second  was  a  web-based 
survey  conducted  from  April  4  through  April  29,  2005.  Taken  together,  the  tele-
phone poll data and the two sets of demographically stratified web survey data pro-
vide  extremely  accurate  results,  with  a  raw  sample  margin  of  error  of  less  than  1 
percent,  and  less  than  0.5  percent  with  sample  stratification.  We  specifically  ex-
cluded  polling  our  roughly  5,000  furloughed  pilots,  who  would  presumably  be  the 
strongest supporters of keeping the Rule in place. 

The  results  of  the  survey  show  that  a  majority  of  ALPA  pilots  favor  maintaining 

the Age 60 Rule. Consider the following statistics from the survey: 

• When asked in a straight-forward yes or no format, ‘‘Do you favor changing the 
FAA  Age  60  Rule?’’  56  percent  of  ALPA  pilots  support  maintaining  the  current 
rule; 42 percent want it to change. 
• When  we  asked  pilots  specifically  about  changing  the  Rule  to  age  65,  support 
for  maintaining  the  current  rule  rose  to  58  percent  and  support  for  change 
dropped to 39 percent. 
• The  more  specific  we  got,  the  fewer  pilots  supported  change.  When  given  a  se-
ries  of  options  and  asked  which  they  would  most  support,  54  percent  support 
the  current  rule,  while  only  10  percent  support  increasing  the  age  limit  to  62, 
and only 22 percent support increasing it to 65. Further, fewer than 10 percent 
support  the  option  of  changing  the  Rule  to  one  that  measures  physical  ability 
and health on an individual basis, regardless of age. And, fewer than 5 percent 
support increasing the age limit to higher than age 65 (2 percent), or lifting the 
age limit completely (3 percent). 

Several  collateral  findings  indicate  that  the  majority  who  oppose  a  change  in  the 
Age  60  Rule  could  grow  even  larger—into  the  low-to-mid-60  percent  range  or  high-
er—depending  on  the  specifics  of  any  requirements  and/or  restrictions  that  might 
be  proposed.  We  asked  pilots  whether  they  support  additional  operational  and/or 
medical  requirements  if  the  Rule  is  changed.  Only  29  percent  support  additional 
medical  exams,  a  mere  23  percent  support  more  line/simulator  checks,  and  only  22 
percent  support  additional  operational  restrictions  if  the  Age  60  regulation  is 
changed. 

These  results  reflect  the  pilot  profession’s  perspective  on  the  Age  60  Rule.  Addi-
tionally, numerous court decisions, extensive medical studies, and previous Congres-

22 

sional  actions  have  led  to  the  same  conclusion:  This  rule  should  be  changed  only 
if  we  can  guarantee—beyond  all  reasonable  doubt—that  any  change  will  have  a 
positive effect on air safety. 
Rationale for Maintaining the FAA Age 60 Rule 

The  Age  60  Rule  is  based  on  two  fundamental  principles  of  medical  science  that 
are  indisputable.  First,  the  risks  of  incapacitation  and  unacceptable  decrements  in 
performance increase with age. Second, medical science has not developed a regimen 
of reliable tests that can be administered effectively to determine which aging pilots 
will  become  incapacitated,  or  whose  performance  will  decline  to  an  unacceptable 
level. The issues surrounding the regulation have been studied as thoroughly as any 
aeromedical matter affecting pilots, and after decades of comprehensive studies and 
exhaustive  review,  these  two  principles  are  still  valid  as  the  underlying  basis  for 
the Rule. 

The  FAA,  when  it  reviewed  the  most  advanced  cognitive  testing  technology, 
known  as  CogScreen-AE,  concluded  that  that  test  ‘‘cannot  sufficiently  identify  age- 
related  cognitive  function  deficits  that  would  impact  pilot  performance  and  aircraft 
safety.’’  On  appeal  of  this  decision  in  Yetman  v.  Garvey  261  F.3d  at  675  (7th  Cir. 
2001), the Court of Appeals affirmed the FAA’s decision, concluding: ‘‘Ultimately, we 
find that substantial evidence supports the FAA’s finding that CogScreen-AE is not, 
at  this  point,  an  adequate  cognitive  tool  for  determining  whether  an  exemption  to 
the Age 60 Rule is warranted.’’ 

Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a lower court ruling declining to hear 
a  group  of  pilots’  applications  for  exemption  from  the  FAA  Age  60  Rule  in  Butler 
v. FAA, cert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 1986 (May 2, 2005). 

The Age 60 Rule has also withstood the legal challenge that it constitutes age dis-
crimination. Although the Rule does mandate a chronological age for retirement, the 
D.C. Circuit Court ruled that it does not violate the Age Discrimination in Employ-
ment  Act  (ADEA).  In  Professional  Pilots  Federation  (PPF)  v.  FAA,  118  F.3d  at  763 
(D.C.  Cir.  1997),  the  court  held  that,  ‘‘nothing  in  the  ADEA  can  plausibly  be  read 
to restrict the FAA from making age a criterion for employment when it acts in its 
capacity  as  the  guarantor  of  public  safety  in  the  air . . . therefore,  we  conclude 
that  the  ADEA  does  not  limit  the  authority  of  the  FAA  to  prescribe  a  mandatory 
retirement age for pilots.’’ 

In  late  1979,  the  House  of  Representatives  rejected  a  proposal  to  relax  the  Rule, 
and  directed  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  to  conduct  a  study  to  determine  if 
sufficient medical evidence supported the Rule. In August 1981, the National Insti-
tute of Aging Review Panel on the Experienced Pilots Study, which was responsible 
for reviewing the study and submitting a report to Congress, concluded: 

‘‘The  Panel  attaches  no  special  medical  significance  to  age  60  as  a  mandatory 
age  for  retirement  of  airline  pilots.  It  finds,  however,  that  age-related  changes 
in health and performance influence adversely the ability of increasing numbers 
of  individuals  to  perform  as  pilots  with  the  highest  level  of  safety  and,  con-
sequently, endanger the safety of the aviation system as a whole. Moreover, the 
Panel could not identify the existence of a medical or performance appraisal sys-
tem that can single out those pilots who would pose the greatest hazard because 
of early or impending deterioration in health or performance.’’ 

After  the  NIA  completed  its  review,  the  Rule  was  contested  in  Federal  court  and 
reconsidered  by  the  FAA.  In  1989,  in  response  to  a  directive  by  the  U.S.  Court  of 
Appeals  for  the  Seventh  Circuit,  the  FAA  reviewed  the  evidence  and  reaffirmed  its 
support  of  the  Rule.  In  the  decision,  the  FAA’s  Director  of  Flight  Standards  stated: 
‘‘Based upon all of the studies discussed, we conclude that an older pilot’s edge 
in experience does not offset the undetected physical infirmities associated with 
the  aging  process.  Notwithstanding  that  most  pilots  who  are  approaching  or 
have passed age 60 report that their health is excellent and they do not experi-
ence  any  physical  or  cognitive  limitations  which  would  prevent  them  from  con-
tinuing  their  flying  career,  the  research  of  aging  indicates  that  there  is  often 
a  sharp  decline  in  physical  and  cognitive  performance  after  age  60.  There  is 
substantial scientific evidence which indicates that the greater experience of the 
pilots  who  have  reached  or  passed  age  60  does  not  outweigh  the  increased  risk 
of incapacitation or skill deterioration which accompanies seniority.’’ 

Between 1990 and 1994, the FAA sponsored a four-part study, known as the ‘‘Hil-
ton  Reports,’’  to  review  the  Age  60  Rule.  The  part  that  received  the  most  attention 
was a study of accident rates as a function of age, and that part concluded that the 
FAA  could  cautiously  raise  the  age  limit  to  63.  However,  the  FAA  found  some  sub-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:28 Jan 14, 2011 Jkt 063516 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\63516.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

23 

stantial flaws in the accident study and never adopted its conclusions. The D.C. Cir-
cuit upheld the FAA’s decision in PPF v. FAA, 118 F.3d at 769. 

Between  2000  and  2003,  the  FAA,  at  the  request  of  Congress,  sponsored  an  up-
dated  four-part  study  conducted  by  the  Civil  Aerospace  Medical  Institute  (CAMI). 
The  CAMI  study  claimed  that  no  necessary  relationship  existed  between  the  acci-
dent rate and pilot age, but in 2004 an update to the original CAMI study analyzed 
the  general  methodology  used  in  accident  studies  and  concluded  that  the  data  are 
prone to errors and misinterpretations, thus calling into question the results. 

Advocates for changing the Rule point out that many countries have an upper age 
limit  beyond  60,  and  a  few  have  no  upper  age  limit  at  all.  Some  countries  have 
modified  their  regulations  for  licensure  purposes  as  one  way  to  address  their  pilot 
staffing  needs.  However,  this  is  not  a  need  in  the  United  States,  where  more  than 
6,000 ALPA pilots are currently furloughed because of the financial state of the air-
line industry. 

Pilots  for  many  of  the  major  airlines  in  Europe  actually  retire  before  the  age  of 
60,  some  as  young  as  55.  This  corresponds  with  a  large  percentage  of  pilots  for  the 
major  U.S.  carriers  who  actually  retire  before  age  60  for  medical  or  other  reasons. 
Also, regardless of the local regulatory requirement, at most European national car-
riers,  their  collective  bargaining  agreements  govern  the  retirement  age,  which  in 
most cases is less than 60, and pilots older than 60 are generally limited to the sec-
ond-in-command position. 

These  examples  substantiate  the  FAA’s  determination  that  the  Age  60  Rule  is 
reasonable and within an acceptable range of risk for commercial air transportation 
operations  and  has  proven  to  be  an  effective  safety  regulation.  The  results  of  the 
ALPA  Age  60  survey  reaffirm  the  Association’s  policy  in  support  of  the  FAA’s  posi-
tion. 

Mr. Chairman, let me conclude my statement by saying that commercial aviation 
is the safest form of transport in human history. I am proud of the role that ALPA 
pilots have played in achieving that reality. We cannot take that reality for granted, 
however.  We  must  do  all  we  can  to  defend  and  preserve  our  safety  record—and  re-
sist  all  attempts  to  change  safety  regulations  simply  to  boost  profit  margins.  The 
Age  60  Rule  is  a  safety  regulation  and  should  not  be  changed  or  repealed  unless 
and  until  the  FAA—not  ALPA  or  any  other  pilot  organization—is  convinced,  based 
on  sufficient  and  conclusive  evidence,  that  such  action  would  not  have  a  negative 
effect on safety.

STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN JOSEPH ‘‘IKE’’ EICHELKRAUT, 

PRESIDENT, SOUTHWEST AIRLINES PILOTS’ ASSOCIATION 
Mr. EICHELKRAUT. Chairman Burns—— 
Senator  BURNS.  President  of  Southwest  Airlines  Pilots’  Associa-
tion, sorry about that, I’m—we look forward to your testimony and 
thank you for coming. 

Mr.  EICHELKRAUT.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Burns  and  Chairman 

Stevens, Senator Pryor. 

erybody wants to hear you. 

Senator  BURNS.  You  might  want  to  pull  that  microphone  up,  ev-

Mr.  EICHELKRAUT.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  on 
the  Age  60  Rule.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  commend  you  and  Chairman 
Stevens  for  your  leadership  in  becoming  original  co-sponsors  of  S. 
65, which would end the Age 60 Rule, and the 45 years of age dis-
crimination it has engendered. 

At Southwest Airlines, we view the Age 60 Rule as a solution in 
search of a problem. It is a government-imposed restriction without 
a justifiable medical or safety explanation, and the Rule is more in-
defensible now than it has ever been.

In  today’s  economically  strained  aviation  industry,  it  seems  that 
companies  can  renege  on  pension  promises  made  to  their  pilots, 
leaving  them  without  a  livelihood  and  with  reduced  retirement 
benefits at age 60, and our government won’t let these pilots, many 
of  whom  are  the  safest,  most  experienced  pilots  in  the  skies,  keep 
working until they are eligible for Social Security or Medicare ben-
efits. No one on this panel in support of changing the Rule is look-
ing  for  a  handout.  We  are  simply  asking  Congress  to  tell  the  FAA 
to allow us to work, to let us pay into Social Security and our own 
pension funds, and to retire at 65, our national retirement age. 

At Southwest Airlines, we believe safety has never been the real 
basis  for  this  rule.  After  all,  millions  of  hours  of  flight  time  have 
been  logged  by  pilots  over  60,  all  over  the  world,  and  there  has 
never been a single accident in a two-man crew environment attrib-
uted to pilot age. Moreover, the FAA routinely permits pilots of for-
eign  carriers  who  are  over  the  age  of  60  to  fly  here,  but  not  the 
U.S. pilot, operating under Part 121. 

In a related issue, the FAA maintained, until this year, that safe-
ty  was  the  reason  why  air  traffic  controllers  were  forced  to  retire 
at  56.  In  the  face  of  controller  shortages,  however,  the  FAA  now 
permits them to work until 61, and says that safety is less of a con-
cern. 

So,  if  it  is  not  about  safety,  what  is  the  reason?  Well,  the  Age 
60 Rule came about in 1959, not due to any public outcry over safe-
ty  concerns,  but  as  a  convenient  way  to  settle  a  labor  dispute  re-
garding  forced  retirements  at  American  Airlines  over  training  pi-
lots to fly the brand-new Boeing 707 jet aircraft. ALPA successfully 
challenged, and reversed, these company-imposed retirements. Fol-
lowing  this,  C.R.  Smith,  CEO  of  American  Airlines  turned  to  FAA 
Administrator  Pete  Quesada,  and  asked  him  to  make  age  60  the 
federally  mandated  retirement  age  for  airline  pilots.  The  rule  be-
came effective on March 15, 1960. 

Today, ALPA supports the Rule, but apparently only for U.S. pi-
lots.  If  safety  were  truly  a  concern  for  the  ALPA  leadership,  why 
would they compromise safety principles to negotiate a contract al-
lowing Canadian regional Jazz pilots to fly until the age of 65? 

In  a  display  of  solidarity,  the  pilots  and  management  of  South-
west Airlines strongly support changing the Rule. In a recent ami-
cus brief to the Supreme Court, Southwest Airlines argued that the 
FAA’s  rigid  implementation  of  the  Rule  deprives  not  only  South-
west  Airlines,  but  the  flying  public,  of  some  of  its  best  pilots.  Our 
founder, and Chairman of the Board, Herb Kelleher summed up his 
reasons  for  supporting  change  by  telling  a  reporter,  ‘‘It’s  the  right, 
moral thing to do.’’ 

The  EEOC  opposes  the  Age  60  Rule,  and  maintains  that  it  vio-
lates the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. In 1981, the Na-
tional  Institutes  of  Health  agreed,  saying,  ‘‘The  Age  60  Rule  ap-
pears  indefensible  on  medical  grounds.’’  The  American  Association 
of Retired Persons agrees as well. 

The  fact  is,  the  FAA  already  has  in  place  the  ideal  mechanism 
for  ensuring  safe  pilots  at  any  age.  The  current  system  of  checks 
and  balances  including  a  fail-safe  cockpit  with  two  pilots  simply 
won’t  fall  apart  the  day  a  pilot  turns  60.  And  given  a  chance  to 
work, we know the current system will continue to perform as well.

To retain my license, I must pass semi-annual physicals, admin-
istered  by  an  FAA-licensed  aero-medical  examiner.  At  40  years  of 
age,  pilots  must  undergo  an  annual  EKG,  which  is  electronically 
transmitted  to  the  FAA.  We  must  pass  simulator  training  twice 
each  year,  along  with  flight  checks  annually.  By  the  way,  there  is 
no greater test of cognitive ability than these simulator rides. 

Additionally, we are also subject to random in-flight check rides, 
and  random  drug  screens.  There  is  no  other  profession  in  America 
today  examined  to  this  level.  A  59-year-old  captain  arrives  at  this 
point in his or her career, having performed successfully for years, 
and  is  one  of  the  fittest  and  best-trained  pilots  in  the  skies.  Yet, 
the  FAA  forces  the  retirement  of  hundreds  of  these  pilots  every 
year because of the Age 60 Rule. 

The FAA’s system is self-purging, and will continue to maintain, 
or  improve,  the  level  of  safety  the  public  counts  on  independently 
of this rule. Today, simulator failure rates among Southwest pilots 
are  low,  as  shown  on  the  graph  in  my  written  testimony.  But  as 
pilots approach age 60, the failure numbers are at their lowest. Ex-
perience  is  a  key  to  this  fact.  It  follows,  that  as  pilots  get  older, 
they  will  be  better  able  to  handle  complex  situations,  when  air-
borne,  that  they  may  have  encountered  in  simulator  training  and 
evaluations. 

In  1993,  the  FAA  relates  the  Hilton  study,  which  backs  up  this 
data. The study found a modest decrease of accident rates with age, 
and  no  sign  of  increase  in  accident  rates  as  pilots  near  the  age  of 
60.  That  suggests  to  me  that  by  retiring  these  pilots  at  60,  the 
overall safety of the flying public is compromised. 

Some  of  you  may  remember  that  16  years  ago  today,  July  19, 
1989,  United  Airlines  Flight  232,  loaded  with  285  passengers  and 
11  crew  members,  found  itself  without  hydraulics,  unable  to  turn, 
and essentially doomed. By using throttle movements to control the 
paralyzed  aircraft,  59-year-old  Captain  Haynes  and  his  crew  were 
able  to  get  it  back  to  a  runway  in  Sioux  City,  Iowa.  The  lives  of 
186 people were saved by his actions and his experience. In subse-
quent  simulator  tests,  other  crews  were  unable  to  repeat  this.  Al 
Haynes  was  forced  to  retire  that  year  because  the  FAA  told  him 
he was too old. 

The  Committee  has  before  it  a  great  solution,  S.  65,  and  its 
House companion H.R. 65 would give pilots over 60 the opportunity 
to  continue  flying  passengers  safely  to  their  destinations,  until 
these pilots reach our national retirement age. 

Mr.  Chairman,  the  pilots  of  Southwest  Airlines,  and  all  of  those 
here in uniform today, appreciate your willingness to hold this im-
portant  hearing,  and  hope  that  it  will  be  the  first  step  in  moving 
legislation  to  change  the  FAA’s  antiquated  and  discriminatory  Age 
60 Rule once and for all.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN JOSEPH ‘‘IKE’’ EICHELKRAUT, PRESIDENT, 

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES PILOTS’ ASSOCIATION 

Chairman Burns, Ranking Senator Rockefeller, and distinguished members of the 
Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today and to present the views

sors of S. 65, which would end the Age 60 Rule and the 45 years of age discrimina-
tion it had engendered. 

At  Southwest  Airlines,  we  view  the  FAA  Age  60  Rule  as  a  solution  in  search  of 
a  problem.  It  is  a  government  imposed  restriction  without  a  justifiable  medical  or 
safety  explanation,  and  the  Rule  is  more  indefensible  today  than  it  ever  has  been. 
In the current economically strained aviation industry, it seems that companies can 
renege  on  pension  promises  made  to  their  pilots,  and  leave  them  without  a  way  to 
make a living and with reduced retirement benefits at age 60. And our government 
won’t let these pilots—many of whom are the safest, most experienced pilots in the 
skies—keep  working  until  our  national  retirement  age  of  65  when  they  are  eligible 
for  Social  Security  and  Medicare  benefits.  No  one  on  this  panel  here  today  in  sup-
port  of  changing  the  Rule  is  looking  for  a  handout.  We  are  simply  asking  Congress 
to  tell  the  FAA  to  allow  us  to  work,  to  let  us  pay  into  Social  Security  and  our  own 
pension funds, and to retire at an age more in line with current economic and social 
conventions. 
Safety or Economics? 

Safety  is  not  now,  and  never  has  been  the  basis  for  this  rule  forcing  commercial 
pilots flying under Part 121 to retire before their 60th birthday. As Southwest pilots 
reach 60, like pilots of other airlines, they are usually the best pilots they have ever 
been. Pilots age 60 and over fly passengers safely in countries across the globe every 
day.  There  are  millions  of  hours  of  flight  time  that  have  been  logged  by  pilots  over 
60  all  over  the  world,  and  there  has  never  been  a  single  accident  attributed  to  a 
pilot’s  age.  In  fact,  the  FAA  routinely  grants  waivers  to  overseas  pilots  of  foreign 
carriers over age 60, but not for the U.S. pilot operating under Part 121. 

The FAA says the age restriction is only about safety, but recent and past actions 
on the part of the agency seem to point to economics and politics, rather than safety 
as  the  number  one  consideration  on  the  age  question.  Similar  age  restrictions  had 
been placed on air traffic controllers. Until this year, the FAA maintained that safe-
ty  was  the  reason  why  controllers  were  forced  to  retire  at  56.  In  the  face  of  short-
ages of controllers, however, the FAA now permits them to work until 61, and says 
that safety is less of a concern. 

The same logic must have applied when the FAA exempted a group of pilots from 
the  Age  60  Rule  between  1995  to  1999,  that  were  flying  aircraft  carrying  between 
10  and  30  passengers.  Prior  to  1995,  these  passenger  operations  were  conducted 
under  FAR  Part  135,  but  were  shifted  by  the  FAA  in  1995,  to  come  under  compli-
ance of Part 121 operations with its age 60 rule. If the FAA truly believed that the 
level of safety could not be maintained, then why grant the exception for these pilots 
to  continue  flying  well  past  the  age  of  60?  The  FAA  often  cites  its  duty  to  ensure 
air carriers operate with the highest possible degree of safety. But this does not ex-
plain why the FAA applies the Age 60 Rule to some, but not to all air carriers oper-
ating in the United States. 

In  a  1991  letter,  Dr.  Stanley  Mohler,  then  Director  of  Aerospace  Medicine  at 
Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, references a meeting held in Congressman 
Edward  Roybal’s  office  in  the  1980s,  on  the  same  subject  before  us  today  in  this 
hearing. According to Dr. Mohler, the FAA, represented at the meeting by Adminis-
trator Don Engen, Federal Air Surgeon, Frank Austin, and Deputy Federal Air Sur-
geon,  Jon  Jordan,  stated  that  there  was  no  longer  a  medical  basis  for  the  Age  60 
regulation.  He  goes  on  in  his  letter  to  say  that  the  FAA  was  reluctant  to  delete  or 
make exceptions to the Rule primarily because of administrative burdens it believed 
would be placed on the airlines. It was pure economics. 
Background on the Age 60 Rule 

If  it  is  not  about  safety,  then  what  is  the  Rule  all  about?  The  Age  60  rule  came 
about in 1959, not due to any public outcry over safety concerns, but as a convenient 
way  to  settle  a  labor  dispute  at  American  Airlines  over  training  pilots  to  fly  new 
Boeing  707  jet  aircraft.  It  took  longer  to  train  older  pilots  with  no  prior  jet  experi-
ence  than  younger,  jet  experienced,  Korean  War  veterans,  and  therefore,  it  was 
more  expensive  to  transition  the  older  pilots.  There  were  no  safety  or  medical  con-
cerns expressed by either American Airlines or a panel of experts, convened in May 
1959  by  the  Administrator,  which  recommended  that  age  55  become  the  maximum 
age  for  jet  transition  and  age  60  become  the  federally  mandated  retirement  age  for 
airline  piloting.  The  age  55  provisions  went  away  due  to  comments  at  public  hear-
ings  and  written  comments.  The  age  60  proposal  was  never  publicly  aired  per  the 
prescribed  rulemaking  process  nor  was  there  any  medical  or  statistical  evidence  of 
reduced  performance  in  older  airline  pilots.  In  the  Q&A  section  of  the  FAA  press 
release  that  announced  the  age  rule,  the  first  question  asks:  ‘‘Has  it  been  dem-

27 

onstrated that age is a factor in the occurrence of air carrier accidents?’’ The Answer 
was, and remains, ‘‘No.’’ 

The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) opposed age-based retirement as a matter 
of policy, and challenged these company-imposed age-based retirements through the 
grievance  process.  In  1958–59,  grievances  were  directed  against  American  Airlines 
(whose  pilots  were  represented  by  ALPA  at  the  time),  TWA  and  Western  Airlines. 
In  some  cases  the  companies  used  medical  and  flight-safety  arguments  to  support 
their  positions;  interestingly  enough,  ALPA  succeeded  in  rebutting  these  points, 
which had no scientific or medical evidence back then either. Each of the grievances 
were  decided  in  favor  of  the  union  and  against  the  airline.  C.R.  Smith,  American 
Airlines  founder  and  CEO,  unhappy  with  the  arbitrator’s  decision,  refused  to  rein-
state  the  three  pilots  who  had  brought  the  retirement  grievance.  ALPA  called  for 
a strike against American. After the 21-day walkout, the company ceded most points 
to the pilot group and pilots returned to work. 

Unable to hold back the pilots through normal collective bargaining, Smith turned 
to  a  longtime  friend,  Elwood  R.  (Pete)  Quesada,  who  had  been  appointed  Adminis-
trator of the newly-created Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In a letter dated 
February 5, 1959, Smith asked the FAA to proclaim age 60 as a federally-mandated 
retirement  age  for  pilots.  Quesada  obliged  by  proposing  what  we  now  know  as  the 
Age 60 Rule. The FAA issued its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) less than 
1  month  after  Quesada  received  Smith’s  request.  I  am  unaware  of  any  Congres-
sional  or  FAA  hearing  to  debate  the  proposal  at  the  time.  The  Final  Rule,  which 
was  modified  to  pertain  only  to  air  carrier  pilots,  was  published  on  December  5, 
1959,  and  became  effective  on  March  15,  1960.  In  January  1962,  Administrator 
Quesada retired from the FAA and was elected to American Airline’s Board of Direc-
tors. 

Today  ALPA  is  opposed  to  allowing  U.S.  pilots  to  fly  past  60.  But  they  support 
flying  up  to  the  age  of  65  for  Canadian  pilots.  If  safety  were  truly  a  concern  of  the 
ALPA  leadership,  why  would  ALPA  President,  Captain  Duane  Woerth,  compromise 
those  safety  principles  by  affixing  his  signature  to  an  agreement  permitting  Cana-
dian Regional Jazz pilots to fly until age 65? 
Time for a Change 

The  4,700+  pilots  of  the  Southwest  Airlines  Pilots’  Association  and  the  manage-
ment of Southwest Airlines strongly support changing the Rule. In a recent Amicus 
Curiae  brief  to  the  Supreme  Court,  Southwest  Airlines  argued  that  FAA’s  applica-
tion  of  the  Age  60  Rule,  without  consideration  of  individual  pilot  abilities,  health 
conditions or medical data is purely arbitrary and not justified; moreover, the FAA’s 
rigid implementation of the Rule deprives Southwest Airlines of some of its best pi-
lots at the peak of their careers. SWA believes that the arbitrary rejection of all age 
exemption requests disserves the public interest by depriving commercial airlines of 
leadership and experience in the cockpit. At recent rally outside the Capitol, South-
west  Airlines  Founder  and  Chairman  of  the  Board,  Herb  Kelleher,  responded  can-
didly to one reporter’s questions, ‘‘It’s the right, moral thing to do!’’ 
Experts Agree: It’s Age Discrimination 

The  rule  amounts  to  nothing  more  than  blatant  age  discrimination  and  needs  to 
change.  The  Equal  Opportunity  Employment  Commission  (EEOC)  agrees.  The 
EEOC  opposes  the  Age  60  rule  and  maintains  that  the  FAA  violates  the  Age  Dis-
crimination  in  Employment  Act  of  1968  (ADEA)  because  it  unjustifiably  applies  a 
different  standard  to  pilots  over  age  59  than  younger  pilots  doing  the  same  job.  In 
fact,  The  EEOC  has  successfully  forced  private  corporations  to  eliminate  rules  that 
required their pilots to retire at 60. 

The American Association of Retired Persons agrees as well. In a letter of support 
to Senator James Inhofe for S. 65, they state ‘‘. . . Older workers, like all workers, 
should  be  judged  on  the  basis  of  their  individual  competency  and  ability  to  do  the 
job. There is no evidence that pilots over 60 perform worse than younger pilots. In-
deed,  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  lengthy  experience  is  a  good  predictor  of  pilot 
competence.’’ 

The NIH agrees too. In 1981, The National Institute on Aging of the National In-
stitutes of Health agreed saying, ‘‘The Age 60 Rule appears indefensible on medical 
grounds,’’ and ‘‘There is no convincing evidence to support age 60, or any other spe-
cific age for mandatory pilot retirement.’’ 
Safe Cockpits at Any Age 

The FAA has stated that unless it can be assured that the level of safety is main-
tained or improved, it cannot support a change to the current age 60 rule. But this 
condition stated by the FAA is already and inherently attained by their own existing 
procedures—procedures which are the gold standard around the world. The FAA al-

ready has in place the ideal mechanisms for ensuring safe pilots at any age, regard-
less  of  whether  they  are  35,  45,  55  or,  frankly,  65  years  old.  The  current  system 
of  checks  and  balances  does  not  simply  fall  apart  the  day  a  pilot  turns  60;  given 
the  chance  to  work,  we  know  that  the  current  system  would  continue  to  perform 
as  well.  In  a  perfect  world,  this  system  coupled  with  the  choice  of  the  pilot,  would 
dictate when the proper age for retirement has been reached. 

Let’s  review  the  current  system  in  place.  To  retain  my  license,  and  fly  as  a  pilot 
for  Southwest  Airlines,  I  must  pass  semi-annual  flight  physicals  administered  by  a 
qualified (FAA-licensed) aero-medical examiner (AME). When a pilot turns 40 years 
of  age,  he  must  undergo  an  annual  EKG  every  other  flight  physical,  which  is  elec-
tronically transmitted by the AME directly to FAA headquarters where a computer 
program alerts if parameters dictate. 

Pilots  must  also  successfully  pass  semi-annual  simulator  training  and  flight 
checks designed to evaluate the crewmember’s ability to respond to various aircraft 
emergencies,  and/or  competently  handle  advances  in  flight  technology  and  the  Air 
Traffic  Control  (ATC)  environment.  Captains  must  demonstrate,  twice  yearly,  com-
plete  knowledge  of  systems  and  procedures,  safe  piloting  skills,  and  multi-tasking 
by  managing  emergency  and  normal  flight  situations,  typically  in  instrument  flight 
conditions  conducted  in  advanced  simulators.  There  is  no  greater  test  of  cognitive 
ability  and  mental  dexterity  than  these  simulator  rides.  Flight  crews  are  also  ad-
ministered random in-flight check rides by FAA inspectors and Southwest check air-
men. Further, we are subject to random alcohol and drug testing at any time while 
on duty. 

There is no other profession in America today examined to this level. The 59 year 
old  Captain  arrives  at  this  point  in  his  career  having  demonstrated  successful  per-
formance following years of this kind of scrutiny. This pilot is one of the fittest, and 
best  trained  pilots  in  the  skies.  Yet  the  FAA  forces  Southwest  and  other  airlines 
to  retire  hundreds  of  their  best  every  year  because  of  the  age  60  rule.  These  are 
the  checks  and  balances  that  are  in  place  today  for  every  pilot:  two  pilots  in  a 
failsafe  cockpit,  twice  yearly  medicals,  annual  training,  annual  simulator  evalua-
tions,  annual  flight  evaluations,  Federal  inspectors,  computer-verified  EKG’s,  and 
Chief Pilot supervision. The list goes on and on. The system works now. The system 
is  self  purging.  It  will  continue  to  maintain  the  level  of  safety  the  FAA  banks  on 
every day, and says that it needs in order to consider a change in the current rule. 
Today,  simulator  failure  rates  among  Southwest  pilots  are  low.  But  as  pilots  ap-
proach age 60 the failure numbers are at their lowest. The graph below shows this. 

Experience  is  the  key  in  this  fact.  As  pilots  get  older,  they  know  how  to  better 
handle the extreme situations they may have encountered in simulator checks. The 
mean failure rate declines at an even rate from a pilot’s thirties through his fifties. 
Of  course,  because  of  the  Age  60  rule,  I  don’t  have  data  to  show  that  this  trend 
would continue throughout a pilot’s sixties, but I suspect it would. 

In  1993,  the  FAA  itself  released  the  Hilton  Study,  which  backs  up  the  simulator 
data above. The study found that ‘‘The data for all groups of pilots were remarkably

consistent  in  showing  a  modest  decrease  in  accident  rate  with  age  [and]  no  sign  of 
increase in accident rates as pilots near age 60.’’ That would suggest to me that by 
retiring these pilots at 60, the overall safety of the flying public is compromised. 

Commercial  flying,  under  Part  121  passengers  requires  a  pilot  and  co-pilot,  at 
least  in  the  large  commercial  aircraft  which  SWA  flies.  It  is  uncommon  for  one  of 
the  pilots  to  become  ill  during  flight,  but  not  unheard  of.  In  such  cases,  the  other 
pilot is present to safely conduct the flight to a conclusion, at which point, a replace-
ment  is  obtained  before  continuing.  Most  of  the  illnesses  encountered  during  the 
flight  regime  encompass  pressurization  changes  or  incompatible  food  ingestion  (the 
latter  is  probably  the  greatest  source  of  illnesses  flying  on  line).  Less  frequent  are 
the unwanted physiological responses to pressure changes, but the most common is 
an inability to neutralize pressures in the sinuses or Eustachian tubes (ears) during 
climbs and descents. 
Why Change Now? 

Safety has never been anything more than a pretense for the Rule. Political oppo-
sition to change is strong and comes from respected organizations like the FAA and 
ALPA.  Age  discrimination  laws  have  been  in  place  for  decades  and  haven’t  forced 
a change in the Rule. Why should Congress act to change it now? 

The  Rule  has  clearly  been  about  economics  all  along.  And  economics  are  the  rea-
son to change the Rule now. The airline industry is changing. Airline pension funds 
are  migrating  rapidly  from  defined  benefit  (DB)  to  defined  contribution  plans  (DC). 
At Southwest Airlines, my retirement benefits are quite like those that most Ameri-
cans  fortunate  enough  to  have  retirement  benefits  also  have.  I  have  a  401k  plan 
that  my  company  pays  a  defined  contribution  to  every  year.  All  but  a  handful  of 
airlines now have similar benefits. 

U.S.  Airways  and  United  pension  funds  were  terminated  and  taken  over  by  the 
PBGC  this  year.  Delta,  Northwest  and  Continental—essentially  all  DB  plans—are 
at  risk,  and  are  likely  to  add  significantly  to  the  Federal  Government’s  unfunded 
pension  liability.  Pilots  at  these  airlines  have  already  lost  significant  portions  of 
their  retirement,  and  face  uncertain  futures  with  a  gap  in  retirement  and 
healthcare  benefits  to  carry  them  over  to  Social  Security  and  Medicare  age—which 
we all know is going up not down (as ALPA would like it to for pilots). 

Working  to  65  would  help  these  pilots  close  that  gap.  DC  plans  also  offer  pilots, 
and  all  Americans,  an  opportunity  to  maximize  retirement  savings  at  little  cost  to 
the government, and no risk to the PBGC or the corporations. DC plans offer older 
legacy  carrier  pilots  the  only  opportunity  to  recover  from  the  loss  of  their  defined 
benefit  plans.  But  pilots  must  be  able  to  work  until  full  Social  Security  retirement 
age, as S. 65 allows, to maximize these benefits. This will have a net positive impact 
on the Federal budget, and will have a net positive impact on the safety of the flying 
public by keeping our most experienced pilots in the air for an additional few years. 
Breaking Records Past 60 

Today, it seems that sixty-plus year old pilots are breaking world aviation records 
with  regular  frequency.  Just  last  summer  the  world  was  thrilled  when  SpaceShip 
One  became  the  first  manned  commercial  vehicle  to  slip  the  surly  bonds  of  earth. 
The craft was piloted by 63-year-old test pilot Mike Melvill, who had a very physical 
challenge bringing that ship safely back to Earth. Then, we all watched this Spring, 
when 60-year-old Steve Fossett became the first to complete a nonstop, solo airplane 
flight around the world. 

Fossett and Melvill are clearly top pilots, out there ‘‘pushing the edge of the enve-
lope.’’ Under the current FAA rules however, neither would be allowed to fly a Boe-
ing 737 for my airline. 

Today,  July  19,  is  a  fateful  day  in  aviation  history.  Many  of  you  will  remember 
that sixteen years ago today, July 19, 1989, United Airlines Flight 232 took off from 
Denver, CO. Captain Al Haynes reported to air traffic control that his DC–10 loaded 
with  285  passengers  and  11  crew,  were  without  hydraulics  and  unable  to  turn  the 
aircraft,  and  essentially  doomed.  By  using  throttle  movements  to  control  the  para-
lyzed aircraft, Capt. Haynes and his crew began to slowly turn and control the air-
craft,  and  were  able  to  get  it  to  a  runway  in  Sioux  City,  IA.  Although  110  people 
were  killed  that  day,  the  deaths  of  186  people  were  averted  due  to  the  experience 
of fifty-nine year old Captain Al Haynes and his crew. In subsequent simulator tests 
other DC–10 crews were unable to repeat the effort of the crew of Flight 232. Inves-
tigators  concluded  that,  in  its  damaged  condition,  it  was  not  possible  to  land  the 
aircraft on a runway. Al Haynes was forced to retire that year, not because he had 
been in a crash, but because the FAA told him he was too old.

Congress Should Act Now 

30 

The Committee has before it the solution to the problem. S. 65, introduced by Sen. 
James  Inhofe  of  Oklahoma,  and  its  House  companion,  H.R.  65  introduced  by  Rep. 
Jim  Gibbons  (R–NV)  would  give  those  pilots  the  right  to  continue  to  work,  safely 
flying  passengers  to  their  destinations  should  they  chose  to  do  so.  In  fact,  it  is  our 
belief  that  safety  is  actually  compromised  by  requiring  our  most  experienced  pilots 
to retire at the peak of their careers. 

Mr.  Chairman,  the  pilots  of  Southwest  Airlines,  and  all  those  here  in  uniform 
today,  appreciate  your  willingness  to  hold  this  important  hearing,  and  hope  that  it 
will be the first step in moving legislation to change the FAA’s antiquated and dis-
criminatory Age 60 Rule once and for all. 

Thank you. 

Senator  BURNS.  Thank  you  very  much,  Captain.  Now  we’ll  hear 
from  Captain  Ralph  Hunter,  President,  Allied  Pilots  Association. 
Thank you for coming today. 

STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN RALPH HUNTER, PRESIDENT, 

ALLIED PILOTS ASSOCIATION 

Mr.  HUNTER.  Chairman  Burns,  Chairman  Stevens,  Senator 

Pryor, thanks for the opportunity. 

I  am  Captain  Ralph  Hunter,  President  of  the  Allied  Pilots  Asso-
ciation,  representing  the  approximately  13,000  pilots  of  American 
Airlines,  the  world’s  largest  passenger  airline.  On  behalf  of  our 
members,  I  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  testify  before  this 
panel in strong support of the current Age 60 Rule that governs the 
mandatory retirement age for commercial airline pilots. 

In  the  course  of  debating  a  significant  change  to  air  transpor-
tation  regulations,  our  goals  should  be—first,  do  no  harm.  Main-
taining  or  increasing  the  current  level  of  aviation  safety  must  be 
the  primary  test  by  which  any  new  regulation  is  judged.  Economic 
and personal considerations should not be disregarded, but the an-
nals  of  aviation  and  aerospace  history  overflow  with  examples  of 
the false economy that results by giving safety a backseat to other 
issues. 

Safety  concerns  gave  birth  to  the  Age  60  Rule,  and  in  the  ab-
sence of compelling evidence for change, the Federal Government’s 
continuing commitment to aviation safety demands the retention of 
this important regulation. I would submit that much of the current 
support  for  increasing  the  mandatory  retirement  age  of  airline  pi-
lots  is  an  economic  argument  masquerading  as  an  age  discrimina-
tion  argument.  Along  with  most  of  our  Nation’s  commercial  pilots, 
APA pilots have also suffered the financial pains of an industry in 
turmoil.  Despite  this  deep  concern,  we  should  not  contemplate  a 
change  to  the  current  retirement  rule  in  the  absence  of  clear  and 
convincing evidence that safety is not compromised. Mandatory re-
tirement ages are not discriminatory when tied to a bona fide occu-
pational qualification. 

Both  the  U.S.  Court  of  Appeals,  and  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court 
have repeatedly denied challenges to the Age 60 Rule based on this 
doctrine. Many other professions responsible for the public’s health 
and safety, such as law enforcement, firefighting, air traffic control, 
and  even  the  military  impose  some  form  of  mandatory  retirement 
age.  Recognizing  this  important  public  policy,  Congress  passed  an 
exemption  to  the  Age  Discrimination  in  Employment  Act  in  1996, 
allowing  state  and  local  governments  to  set  mandatory  retirement

ages as low as 55 for public-safety employees. It’s simply good pub-
lic  policy  for  individuals  in  safety-sensitive  professions  to  conclude 
their  careers  before  the  natural  process  of  aging  becomes  a  prob-
lem. 

We  all  recognize  that  whenever  mandatory  retirement  is  based 
on  a  fixed  chronological  age,  some  workers  may  well  be  physically 
capable of continuing their careers for some unknown period. How-
ever,  current  medical  technology  does  not  provide  a  safe  and  reli-
able  method  to  make  that  determination,  and  the  use  of  a  fixed, 
chronological  age  has  proved  to  be  a  fair  and  effective  standard. 
Even  the  opponents  of  the  Age  60  Rule  tacitly  admit  this  fact  by 
merely  requesting  an  increase—and  not  elimination—of  the  man-
datory retirement age. 

The  question  then  becomes  what  is  the  appropriate  age  for  a 
pilot to retire before the inevitable effects of aging become too high 
risk?  This  question  has  been  repeatedly  asked,  studied,  and  an-
swered over the Rule’s 46-year history. While opponents of the Age 
60  Rule  would  accuse  the  FAA  of  ancestor  worship,  the  reality  is 
that  as  recently  as  1994,  the  FAA  made  a  significant  rule  change 
for  certain  commercial  flight  operations  that  actually  reduced  the 
retirement  age  for  some  pilots  as  part  of  its  One  Level  of  Safety 
program. 

One of the most recent and comprehensive surveys of the medical 
basis for the Age 60 Rule was published in January of 2004, by the 
Aerospace  Medical  Association.  I’ve  included  the  report  as  an  at-
tachment with my written remarks. Let me quote a few of the key 
findings  from  the  AsMA  study,  ‘‘Physiological  studies  consistently 
show  age-related  declines  in  hearing,  vision  and  motor  skills.  Pilot 
cognitive  performance  has  been  shown  to  generally  decline  with 
age.  A  recent  simulator  study  of  age  and  pilot  performance  found 
that increased age was significantly associated with decreased avi-
ator  performance.  Increased  pilot  experience  does  not  appear  to 
alter  the  typical  age-related  declines  found  in  many  cognitive 
skills.’’ 

While  opponents  of  the  Age  60  Rule  regularly  cite  this  same  re-
port as concluding that there’s insufficient medical evidence to sup-
port pilot restrictions based strictly on chronological age, the study 
also  demonstrates  how  incredibly  difficult  and  expensive  it  would 
be to develop another set of criteria. Quoting from the study’s sum-
mary,  ‘‘A  transition  to  a  criterion-based  process  for  determining  a 
pilot’s  fitness  to  fly  beyond  age  60  would  require  extensive  addi-
tional research. The economic burden on the FAA and corporations 
to  develop  a  non-age  safety  basis  for  denying  pilots  continued  em-
ployment could be significant.’’ 

Despite  the  report’s  support  for  a  shift  away  from  an  age-based 
retirement standard, it presented no viable alternative with a sub-
stantiated capability to maintain the current level of aviation safe-
ty,  with  available  medical  technology.  It’s  significant  to  note  that 
a  majority  of  commercial  airline  pilots  support  the  existing  policy. 
More than 80 percent of APA members supported the Age 60 Rule 
in  a  survey  we  conducted  a  few  years  ago.  The  Air  Line  Pilots  As-
sociation recently re-affirmed its support for age 60 retirement, and 
the FAA has stated its desire to maintain the status quo. I believe 
it  would  be  a  grave  error  to  disregard  the  voices  of  those  closest

to  the  trenches  in  this  debate.  We  are  frequent  observers  of  the 
very real impact of aging on pilot skills. While we know that noth-
ing magical occurs at age 60 years and 1 day, to make a previously 
competent  pilot  unsafe,  we’re  also  keenly  aware  of  the  inevitable 
impact  of  aging  on  pilot  skill,  and  the  near  impossibility  of  clearly 
defining  the  acceptable  limit  of  that  decline  with  current  medical 
technology. 

Our position is firm—the Age 60 Rule is a well-established safety 
regulation  substantiated  by  medical  science,  and  re-affirmed  re-
peatedly  by  the  FAA  and  the  courts.  Despite  the  apparent  arbi-
trariness  of  using  a  fixed,  chronological  age,  the  Rule  has  actually 
performed  its  mission  quite  effectively  for  more  than  46  years.  We 
concede that there very well may come a day when conclusive data 
exists  that  supports  a  replacement  for  the  Age  60  Rule.  However, 
that  data  does  not  currently  exist,  and  the  Federal  Government’s 
commitment  to  aviation  safety  demands  that  the  current  rule  be 
retained. 

I  thank  the  Committee  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  on  behalf  of 
the  13,000  pilots  that  APA  represents,  and  I’ll  be  glad  to  answer 
any questions. 

[The prepared statement of Captain Hunter follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN RALPH HUNTER, PRESIDENT, 

ALLIED PILOTS ASSOCIATION 

Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am Captain Ralph Hunter, Presi-
dent  of  the  Allied  Pilots  Association  (APA)  representing  the  approximately  13,000 
pilots  of  American  Airlines—the  world’s  largest  passenger  airline.  On  behalf  of  our 
members, I thank you for this opportunity to testify before this panel in strong sup-
port  of  the  so  called  ‘‘Age  60  Rule’’  that  governs  the  mandatory  retirement  age  for 
commercial airline pilots. 

In  the  course  of  debating  a  significant  change  to  air  transportation  regulations, 
our goal should be, ‘‘First, Do No Harm.’’ Maintaining or increasing the current level 
of aviation safety must be the primary test by which any new regulation is judged. 
Economic  and  personal  considerations  should  not  be  disregarded,  but  the  annals  of 
aviation and aerospace history overflow with examples of the false economy that re-
sults by giving safety a back seat to other issues. Safety concerns gave birth to the 
Age 60 Rule, and in the absence of compelling evidence for change, the Federal Gov-
ernment’s  continuing  commitment  to  aviation  safety  demands  the  retention  of  this 
important regulation. 

I  would  submit  that  much  of  the  current  support  for  increasing  the  mandatory 
retirement  age  of  airline  pilots  is  an  economic  argument  masquerading  as  an  age 
discrimination  argument.  Along  with  most  of  our  Nation’s  commercial  pilots,  APA 
pilots  have  also  suffered  the  financial  pains  of  an  industry  in  turmoil.  Despite  this 
deep  concern,  we  should  not  contemplate  a  change  to  the  current  retirement  rule 
in absence of clear and convincing evidence that safety is not compromised. 

Let’s be perfectly clear on one point—mandatory retirement ages are not discrimi-
natory  when  tied  to  a  bona  fide  occupational  qualification  (BFOQ).  Both  the  U.S. 
Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court have repeatedly denied challenges to 
the  Age  60  Rule  based  upon  this  doctrine.  Many  other  professions  responsible  for 
the public’s health and safety, such as law enforcement, firefighting, air traffic con-
trol,  and  even  the  military  impose  some  form  of  mandatory  retirement  age.  Recog-

crimination  in  Employment  Act  (ADEA)  in  1996,  allowing  state  and  local  govern-
ments  to  set  mandatory  retirement  ages  as  low  as  55  for  public  safety  employees. 
It is simply good judgment for individuals in safety-sensitive professions to conclude

STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN AL SPAIN, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT,

Mr. SPAIN. Chairman Burns, Senator Stevens, Senator Pryor, on 
behalf of my 8,500 ‘‘crewmembers’’, which we call all of our employ-
ees  at  JetBlue,  particularly  my  1,000  pilots,  I  would  like  to  thank 
you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today  on  this  issue  of  mandatory 
retirement age for airline pilots.

As  we’ve  heard,  we  currently  operate  under  this  rule  that  re-
quires pilots flying under Part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regula-
tions to abandon their cockpit flying duties by their 60th birthday. 
JetBlue pilots and the leadership oppose the current mandatory re-
tirement age rule for many reasons, but most importantly, it’s just 
simply wrong. 

JetBlue,  in  its  five  and  a  half  years  of  operation,  has  achieved 
the Department of Transportation rank of a major carrier. We built 
the  company,  and  we  conduct  our  operations  daily  based  on  five 
simple  values:  safety,  caring,  integrity,  fun,  and  passion.  Safety  is 
our  leading  value,  and  if  I  thought  for  one  second  that  changing 
the  mandatory  retirement  age  would  negatively  impact  safety,  I 
would not be asking for a change today. 

If safety were the true basis for this rule, we would not be seeing 
business  and  world  leaders  traveling  around  the  world  in  complex 
jet  aircraft  operated  by  private  corporations  and  international  air-
lines,  while  being  flown  by  pilots  over  the  age  of  60.  Yet,  today 
these experienced aviators are safely delivering their passengers to 
points far and near. 

Also,  it’s  interesting  that  the  first  commercial  vehicle  to  go  into 
space  and  return  was  under  the  command  of  a  63-year-old  pilot. 
These over-age 60 pilots also enjoy the support of both the National 
Institutes of Health and the Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission, who find no way to support the Age 60 Rule. 

JetBlue would never discriminate in its hiring policies, so in our 
short life, we have recruited a significant number of pilots in their 
mid- to late-50s, hired because of their tremendous experience, and 
their  maturity.  We’ve  seen  four  of  these  pilots—myself  included— 
forced  from  flying  revenue  customers  under  the  Age  60  Rule.  But 
what’s  most  important  is  that  these  JetBlue  pilots,  these  four  pi-
lots, are still flying. Because under Part 91, they still fly the same 
airliners  that  they  flew  before  their  60th  birthday.  Like  their 
younger  pilot  colleagues,  they  still  take,  and  pass,  their  semi-an-
nual  FAA  flight  physical  exams.  They  still  attend  and  successfully 
complete  the  FAA-required  ground  school,  and  proficiency  checks. 
They’re  still  observed  by  both  FAA  inspectors,  and  JetBlue  check 
airmen.  If  the  Age  60  Rule  were  based  on  safety,  we  simply 
wouldn’t  be  doing  this  now.  Our  corporate  values  would  not  allow 
us to disregard an individual’s decades of valuable experience as a 
result of an arbitrary and outdated rule. 

The  proposals  in  S.  65,  while  not  requiring  a  return  to  the  cock-
pit for someone over 60, would at least give the opportunity to take 
this  experience,  maturity,  and  safety  back  into  the  cockpit  at  the 
discretion of the carrier. Additionally, by continuing to fly over age 
60,  the  pilots  would  be  able  to  earn  wages,  pay  taxes,  contribute 
to  their  retirement  plans,  and  close  the  gap  between  the  age  at 
which  they  stop  flying,  and  the  age  at  which  they  are  eligible  for 
Social  Security  and  Medicare  benefits.  The  current  5-year  gap  can 
be  quite  problematic  for  pilots  forced  from  the  cockpit  at  age  60. 
Simple  summary—JetBlue  believes  that  each  pilot  should  be 
judged  on  the  basis  of  his  or  her  ability  to  fly,  their  competency, 
and  their  abilities,  not  on  an  unsubstantiated  and  outdated  rule

tireless  work  on  this  important  issue.  We  urge  the  Committee  to 
move to do its part to make S. 65—a bill to amend the age restric-
tion for pilots—the law of the land. Safety is the basis for our con-
cern. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to testify. 
[The prepared statement of Captain Spain follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN AL SPAIN, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, OPERATIONS, 

JETBLUE AIRWAYS CORPORATION 

Chairman  Burns,  Ranking  Member  Rockefeller,  and  distinguished  members  of 
this Subcommittee. On behalf of my 8,500 JetBlue Airways Crewmember colleagues 
and, in particular, my 1,000 pilot colleagues, thank you for the opportunity to testify 
today on the important issue of the mandatory retirement age for commercial airline 
pilots. 

Today, under a rule first enacted in 1959 by the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA), pilots flying commercial aircraft under Part 121 of the Federal Aviation Reg-
ulations  must  retire  by  their  60th  birthday.  Since  its  enactment  more  than  forty- 
five  years  ago,  this  rule  has  been  the  source  of  great  debate,  and  at  no  time  has 
it been of more intense debate than today. 

JetBlue  and  its  pilot  corps  oppose  the  current  mandatory  retirement  age  rule  for 
many  reasons.  However,  as  I  will  explain  below,  the  principle  reason  is  that  it  is 
simply wrong. 

JetBlue,  established  in  2000,  has  already  achieved  the  Department  of  Transpor-
tation  (DOT)  rank  of  a  ‘‘major’’  carrier—the  quickest  this  status  has  ever  been 
achieved by an airline in the United States. JetBlue was built on five simple values: 
Safety,  Caring,  Integrity,  Fun,  and  Passion—with  Safety  always  first  and  foremost 
in all that we do. These five values are the foundation of our airline, and all of the 
blocks on which JetBlue are built are consistent with these values. With 77 aircraft 
today,  growing  to  91  by  year’s  end,  JetBlue’s  safety  value  lights  the  path  for  our 
continued controlled-growth. 

In  keeping  with  our  safety  value  and  our  integrity  value,  JetBlue  has  stood  on 
the  sidelines  and  watched  as  several  key  pilot  leaders  have  been  removed  from  ac-
tive flying as a result of the Age 60 Rule. This alone, and not any previous or pend-
ing  economic  impact  to  our  healthy  bottom  line,  is  why  I  am  here  today.  JetBlue 
has  been  profitable  for  17  successive  quarters  at  a  time  when  100,000  airline  em-
ployees  have  lost  their  jobs,  several  carriers  are  in  bankruptcy  and  others  openly 
discuss  bankruptcy.  As  an  officer  of  JetBlue,  a  pilot  who  has  been  forced  to  retire 
under  the  Age  60  Rule,  and  as  the  leader  of  our  pilot  corps,  this  is  a  wrong  that 
Congress now should right. Both S. 65, along with H.R. 65, are the means by which 
to do so. 

In  1959,  the  FAA  promulgated  its  rule  based  on  the  ‘‘medical  facts’’  of  the  day. 
It  was  believed  then,  and  relied  upon  as  the  primary  basis  for  the  Rule  itself,  that 
‘‘significant  medical  defects’’  resulted  from  the  progressive  deterioration  of  physio-
logical and psychological functions which occur normally with aging. These supposed 
‘‘facts’’  from  the  last  century  are  anything  but  accepted  facts  today,  and  the  Rule 
based on these ‘‘facts’’ amounts to pure 21st century age discrimination. 

The  facts  of  2005  weigh  in  favor  of  eliminating  the  Age  60  Rule.  As  far  back  as 
1985, The National Institutes of Health testified before the House Select Committee 
on Aging that the National Institute of Aging (part of the NIH) could no longer sup-
port the FAA’s retention of the Age 60 Rule. Similarly, the Equal Opportunity Em-
ployment Commission (EEOC) has held that the FAA Age 60 Rule violates the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act of 1968. In the private sector, the EEOC has suc-
cessfully  ensured  that  private  companies  eliminate  rules  that  required  their  pilots 
retire at age 60. 

In  the  Senate,  one  of  your  most  distinguished  former  colleagues,  Ohio’s  John 
Glenn, at age 77, flew for 9 days in space. More recently, the first manned commer-
cial vehicle to travel to space and back was piloted by test pilot Mike Melvill, winner 
of the X Prize, at age 63. Mr. Melvill, despite worldwide acclaim resulting from his 
historic  achievement,  would  be  barred  by  the  law  were  he  to  try  flying  for  JetBlue. 
Further,  the  American  Association  for  Retired  People,  on  behalf  of  their  35  million 
members over age 50, strongly supports H.R. 65 and S. 65. 

Throughout  the  developed  world,  the  United  States  stands  nearly  alone  by  man-
dating  retirement  of  pilots  at  age  60,  with  the  notable  exceptions  of  France  and 
China. Most nations permit pilots to fly until age 65, such as Japan and Israel, and 
the European Joint Aviation Authority recently raised their age limit to 65 for com-

mercial  pilots.  The  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO),  too,  has  rec-
ommended  that  member  states,  including  the  United  States,  adjust  to  a  maximum 
age of 65 for commercial pilots. 

All JetBlue pilots, whether age 40 or age 59, must undergo rigorous FAA medical 
screening procedures to ensure they are fit to fly. This includes a semi-annual phys-
ical exam and, after age 40, an annual electrocardiogram. Beyond medical screening, 
all pilots must successfully pass a simulator training flight check twice yearly. Such 
testing ensures awareness and thorough knowledge of procedures, systems, piloting 
skills, and the ability to safely manage emergency scenarios. These tests, which en-
sure  the  mental  and  physical  health  of  pilots,  are  in  addition  to  random  in-flight 
check  rides  performed  by  both  FAA  inspectors  and  JetBlue  check  airmen.  Almost 
no worker in America has more oversight when it comes to their medical ability and 
competency  to  fly,  and  no  one  has  more  of  an  incentive  to  maintain  safety  for  the 
flying public than airlines’ themselves. 

Finally,  in  the  current  economic  environment  faced  by  most  airlines,  thousands 
of  pilots  have  lost  their  jobs.  Equally  unfortunate,  for  many  still  employed,  they 
have  seen  their  pension  plans  virtually  eliminated.  Thus,  while  not  at  issue  at 
JetBlue where we have defined contribution plans, many pilots must retire from fly-
ing  at  age  60  and  they  do  not  collect  Social  Security  until  age  65.  The  proposals 
in  S.  65  would  allow  these  experienced  pilots  to  continue  fly,  earn  wages  and  con-
tribute to their pension plans. 

In  this  regard,  JetBlue  has  only  had  a  small  number  of  pilots  removed  from  the 
cockpit due to the Age 60 Rule. Of our more than 1,000 pilots, these few pilots have 
all  remained  employed  as  active  crewmembers,  some  flying  non-revenue  flights, 
some teaching, and some serving as members of our leadership team. JetBlue’s val-
ues  simply  cannot  allow  us  to  disregard  an  individual’s  decades  of  valuable  experi-
ence merely because of an outdated rule. Not only does our airline benefit from the 
wisdom  attained  through  decades  of  experience,  but  these  pilots  remain  active  con-
tributors  to  their  own  retirement  savings.  This  benefits  JetBlue,  our  pilots  and  all 
taxpayers. 

JetBlue believes that each pilot should be judged on the basis of his or her ability 
to  fly  and  their  competency—not  an  unsubstantiated  rule  based  on  outdated  and 
mistaken  medical  assumptions.  We  strongly  support  Senator  Inhofe,  and  Congress-
man Gibbons, both fellow pilots, for their tireless work on this important issue, and 
urge  this  Committee  to  make  S.  65,  a  bill  to  amend  the  age  restrictions  for  pilots, 
the law of the land. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for today’s opportunity to testify. 

Senator BURNS. Thank you, Captain. Senator Stevens has an ap-

pointment coming up and wants to ask a couple of questions. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  very  much,  let  me 
correct  the  record,  I  said  there  were  750  of  our  10,000  pilots  were 
commercial,  and  over  55—it’s  2,000,  2,000  of  our  10,000  pilots  are 
commercial and over 55. It’s a difficult problem for us. 

Let me just ask each of you this, you mentioned a series of polls 
taken,  do  you  know  the  average  age  of  those  people  you  polled, 
Captain Woerth, do you know it? 

Mr. WOERTH. I don’t have the age of the poll, or the average age, 
or  the  median  age  of  the  entire  pilot  group,  I  could  probably  get 
that for you. 

Senator STEVENS.—relate the age to the polls? 
Mr. WOERTH. Throughout the polling process, especially as to the 
random  telephone  poll,  was  randomly  stratified  to  take  out  sam-
pling errors that were biased one way or another. 

As to the survey, anytime you do a survey, it’s voluntary, and we 
had a high number of participants, particularly over the age of 56, 
and  so  we  actually  had  more  older  people,  participating  for  their 
own interests that you’d expect in a democratic organization. 

Senator STEVENS. How about you, Mr. Eichelkraut? 
Mr.  EICHELKRAUT.  I  don’t  have  the  exact  numbers,  sir,  but  I 
would  believe  around  45  or  46  years  old  is  the  average  age  of  the 
respondent.

Senator STEVENS. Captain Hunter? 
Mr.  HUNTER.  I  don’t  have  the  breakout,  sir,  the  last  poll  we  did 

was—— 

Senator STEVENS. Captain Spain? 
Mr. SPAIN. In all of our polls with the pilots, we’ve had about an 
80  percent  response  in  our  pilot,  the  thousand  pilots  we  have,  the 
average age is, I believe it’s 48. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Captain  Hunter,  you  mentioned  in  your  letter 
to  us  that  a  sizable  number  of  these  people  are  furloughed  at  the 
present time, how great is that number? 

Mr. HUNTER. We’re sitting at just under 3,000 pilots on furlough 

from American Airlines. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Do  you  know,  Captain  Woerth,  what  the  fur-

lough rate is for your organization? 

Mr.  WOERTH.  A  little  over  5,000  members  of  ALPA  are  fur-

loughed. 

Hunter, wasn’t it? 

tified. 

ignored that issue? 

Senator STEVENS. OK, and pilot fatigue, you mentioned, Captain 

Mr. HUNTER. That was, I believe it was Captain Woerth that tes-

Senator STEVENS. You, Captain Woerth, you say we’ve ignored it, 

Mr.  WOERTH.  No,  I’m  saying  that  the  Federal  Aviation  Adminis-
tration had put forward some notice of proposed rulemaking almost 
10 years ago, because it was recognized—they had NASA studies— 
that  they  thought  the  flight  time  and  duty  time  regulations,  par-
ticularly  as  to  the  length  of  the  duty  day,  were  antiquated  and 
needed revisions, based on a study by NASA. Nothing’s really come 
of that in almost 10 years, and what I was referring to is, it wasn’t 
just pay concessions that pilots were taking, a lot of the work rules, 
frankly,  were  better  than  FARs  had  been  mitigated,  and  so  many 
of  those  pilots—many  of  those  in  the  room  today—are  flying  more 
hours, longer hours, and longer duty days, and I certainly think the 
struggle we’ve had maintaining even the minimum standards, such 
as  the  16  Hour  Rule,  which  we  have  a  tremendous  fight  with  in 
and  around  the  FAA,  the  16  hours,  those  kind  of  hours  which  are 
becoming  more  and  more  routine,  not  the  exception,  are  adding  to 
pilot  fatigue,  so  no  matter  what  the  age,  this  isn’t  just  a  function 
of,  I’m  57,  I  feel  a  little  more  tired  than  I  did  when  I  was  35,  it 
is an issue even for a 35-year-old, I think fatigue needs to be looked 
at by the Federal Aviation Administration. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  I  flew  transports  in  World  War  II,  and 
I’ll  tell  you,  fatigue  wears  me  a  hell  of  a  lot  more  than  age  does. 
I’d  be  very  pleased  to  work  with  you  on  a  fatigue  thing,  see  if  we 
can’t  get  someone  to  really  take  a  good  long  look  at  that,  that  is 
more  dangerous  to  any  passenger,  in  my  opinion,  than  age.  Thank 
you, Mr. Chairman. 

Senator  BURNS.  For  the  record—the  16  Hour  Rule,  explain  that 

to me, would you, please? 

Mr.  WOERTH.  Yes,  sir,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  quite  some  time  there 
was  a  controversy  over,  if  it,  was  16  hours  really  a  limit,  or  was 
that just a scheduling goal, and we finally had to get a ruling, and 
work  with  the  APA,  in  particular,  on  this,  it  was  known  as  the 
‘‘Whitlow Letter,’’ a person out of the FAA finally determined at 16

hours you are done, a pilot cannot get back in a cockpit and fly just 
because  the  airline  was  running  late,  or  somebody  wants  to  con-
tinue the march, the 16 hours is the real limit. The fact that that’s 
twice the normal day—that might have been a midnight shift going 
until the middle of the afternoon the next day, thank God we have 
the  Whitlow  Letter,  but  there  was  still  opposition  within  certain 
airlines  who  didn’t  want  to  live  with  that,  they  wanted  even  more 
hours to be flown, or a duty day to be even longer than that. 

Senator BURNS. Let me, after you’re, say you’ve been on duty for 

16 hours, now is that 16 hours in the air? 

Mr. WOERTH. Doesn’t have to be in the air, that’s from report to 
release, you might have had a break, you might be in Chicago, you 
might be in Atlanta—— 

Senator BURNS. And then you’re done until when? 
Mr. WOERTH. Well, there’s a rest requirement after that that var-
ies  depending  on  the  rest  of  your  schedule,  but  you  at  least  have 
10 hours off. 

Senator  BURNS.  I  was  going  to  ask  you  about  how  many  pilots 
that are laid off now, or that have been furloughed, and you know, 
there  for  a  little  while,  we  had  a  big  shortage  of  pilots,  in  fact,  it 
wasn’t  very  long  ago  we  were  having  hearings  on  how  to  get  more 
trained  pilots  and  get  them  into  the  air,  and  some  of  those  were 
moving  up  from  local  carriers,  local  service  areas,  and  so  I  think 
my question is a little out of whack, but we’ve been contacted about 
an  agreement  that  you  have  with  Jazz,  a  Canadian  air  carrier, 
which  allows  pilots  to  sign  and  work  until  65.  Why  are  you  sup-
portive  of  this  in  Canada  and  not  in  the  United  States?  I  guess 
you’re kind of going with your poll, I understand your position, but 
why would that be? 

Mr. WOERTH. Yes, Mr. Chairman, when we actually merged with 
pilots  in  Canada  in  1997,  we  had  a  major  merger  when  we  took 
over  a  number  of  pilots  within  Canada.  Air  Canada  Jazz  was  a 
group of regional carriers that happened to be in that group, there 
are other Canadian carriers we represented as well. 

Part of our merger agreement with the Canadian pilots was stuff 
that affected, that was set by Canadian law. If it was by Transport 
Canada,  or  by  the  Canadian  Parliament,  under  our  merger  agree-
ment, they would be able to deal with their government, make the 
decisions  for  Canadians,  not  have  the  United  States  laws  imposed 
upon  them.  As  you  probably  realize,  that  in  Canada,  it  is  one  of 
those  nations  that  does  not  have  the  Age  60  Rule,  so  the  state  li-
censing standards of Canada are different. So, I had no trouble rec-
ognizing  that,  and  since  they’re  allowed  to  do  it  under  Canadian 
law, I wasn’t prepared to become involved in an age discrimination 
suit myself, so, their law permits it, so their contract permits it. 

Senator  BURNS.  We’ve  all  been  involved  in  this  debate  for  some 
time, and I’d like to have your response—all of you—to this. Do you 
think it’s more about economics, or is it more about safety? Yes, sir, 
Mr. Eichelkraut? 

Mr. EICHELKRAUT. It’s about economics, sir. 
Senator BURNS. How do you base that? 
Mr. EICHELKRAUT. Well, I believe that if it were truly about safe-
ty, that we’d look at the individual’s medical requirements, medical 
qualifications,  and  his  operational  qualifications,  and  determine

39 

whether  or  not  he’s  fit  to  fly  Part  121  based  on  those  credentials, 
not on an age issue. 

The economic side of the house is a piece that’s very interesting, 
we come from—I come from a company that has a defined contribu-
tion  retirement  plan,  and  as  such,  the  longer  we  can  work,  the 
longer we can contribute to it. Some of my compadres up here have 
varying  forms  of  that,  or  possibly  not  that,  and  a  defined  benefit 
plan,  and  we  all  know  there’s  stress  under  that,  but  I  think  eco-
nomically there’s some direction being driven by the fact that they 
have  a  defined  benefit  plan,  but  the  contracts  between  labor  and 
management have wound these contracts into being for such a long 
time.  So,  I  actually  think  that  there’s  probably  a  reluctance  to  see 
a  real  change,  because  that  might  force  an  unwinding  of  some  of 
these contracts and these issues to be addressed. 

Senator BURNS. Anybody else have a comment on that question? 
Mr. HUNTER. I would like to. 
Senator BURNS. Captain Hunter? 
Mr.  HUNTER.  I  think  it’s  an  interesting  question,  Mr.  Chairman, 
because  I  think  it  depends  on  precisely  who  you  ask.  I  testified, 
and believe, that this is an economic argument masquerading as an 
age  discrimination  argument.  I  believe  very  strongly,  based  on  the 
feedback  from  my  pilots,  which  have  not  wavered  over  the  course 
of  the  last  14  years  that  we’ve  been  surveying  them,  have  been 
very close 12 years ago to what they were 2 years ago. I might add, 
2  years  ago  they  suffered  some  pretty  significant  economic  losses, 
and  continued  to  believe  that  the  Age  60  Rule  should  remain  in 
place.  So,  clearly  from  my  perspective  it’s  a  safety  issue,  but  I  do 
believe that other arguments are being made for economic reasons. 
Mr. SPAIN. Mr. Chairman, I don’t think that we’re asking for the 
change  based  on  economics,  because  our  pilots,  like  Southwest, 
have  a  defined  contribution  plan,  and  I  think  we  look  at  it  more 
from  a  safety  aspect  and  allowing  a  pilot  to  fly  also,  to  eliminate 
just the absolute age 60 as a discriminatory thing, if we participate 
in  testing  and  get  facts  and  data,  we  certainly  don’t  mind  doing 
that if we have a way, a mechanism to go beyond the age 60. 

Mr. WOERTH. Mr. Chairman, I guess I would say that all of those 
factors would come into play, and as the Senate deals with so many 
issues in our country, whether social issues or economic, there’s no 
clear  line  of  demarcation.  It  is  clear  to  me  that,  as  we  broke  out 
our  survey  of  the  41  airlines  we  represent,  certainly  those  that 
have  recently  lost  their  pensions  whether  they  were  at  United  or 
US Airways, certainly the values in that pilot group for reasons all 
of us can understand, were different than for example, Federal Ex-
press  or  different  for  Delta.  I  don’t  really  have  a  baseline  that  is 
reliable from our previous national survey, but clearly, and another 
thing  that  is  clear,  Mr.  Chairman,  when  I  was  28  and  I  got  hired 
out  of  the  military,  I  wasn’t  paying  a  lot  of  attention  to  this  argu-
ment, ALPA happened to be on the other side of it. One thing that 
I’ve  noticed  in  my  many  years  of  being  a  pilot  representative,  is 
that  at  40  you  need  glasses,  at  50  you  decide  to  probably  think 
about  the  Age  60  Rule  differently,  and  clearly  our  statistics  are 
clear that once you reach age 56, whether you lost your pension or 
not,  pilots  feel  differently  about  the  Rule,  I  don’t  think  anybody 
should  be  surprised,  that’s  human  nature,  all  the  factors  that  go

through  the  pilot’s  mind  as  he  progresses  through  his  career,  they 
weigh  all  of  those  things  differently.  And  so  we  just  try  to  do  the 
best we can being transparent, and represent our members’ major-
ity interest, and I thank you for holding this hearing so we can ex-
press it. 

Senator  BURNS.  I  don’t  walk  on  very  many  airplanes,  I  just  got 
a  letter  the  other  day,  I  hit  two  and  a  half  million  miles  with 
Northwest,  which  means  the  only  thing  you  get  done  in  this  job  is 
your  wear  out  airplanes  and  the  seat  of  your  pants,  where  I  don’t 
say  hello  to  the  pilots  and  strike  up  conversation,  because  we’re 
going  to  reauthorize  FAA  next  year,  changing  technologies  means 
we’re going to have to change some ideas in the FAA and controller 
safety,  new  technology  has  given  us  maybe  a  little  bit  of  leeway 
where we can narrow up our separation a little, and operate safely, 
but  I  take  very  seriously  the  advice  of  the  people,  the  men  and 
women that are flying those planes, so I talk to them a lot. 

Senator Pryor? 
Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. Spain, I’d like to start with you, if I may. 
Mr. SPAIN. Sure. 
Senator PRYOR. I know that you are advocating changing the Age 
60  Rule,  and  at  the  same  time,  as  I  understand  it,  you’re  advo-
cating  changing  some  FAA  rules  and  regs  that  would  allow  pilots 
to  fly  coast  to  coast,  and  back  again  in  the  same  work  period,  is 
that correct? 

Mr. SPAIN. What we asked is that we be able to gather facts and 
data,  and  get  research  on  specifically,  the  duty  time  limitations, 
and  to  see  what  facts  and  data  are,  rather  than  the  8  hour  rule, 
in domestic operations. Yes, sir. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Well,  I  just  wonder  if  those  two  positions  that 
you’re  taking  are  consistent  with  keeping  the  highest  possible 
standard  of  air  safety.  In  other  words,  I  guess  I’m  asking,  do  you 
think  these  two  policy  changes  that  you’re  pursuing  will  enhance 
air safety? 

Mr.  SPAIN.  I  think  so,  sir,  because  we’re  asking  for  facts  and 
data,  we’re  asking  to  find  a  way  to  get  something  other  than  an 
arbitrary  rule  in  duty  time,  in  flight  time  limitations.  And  if  we 
have  facts  and  data,  the  same  thing,  in  age,  finding  the  facts  and 
data beyond age 60 for airline pilots, which there are none, because 
no one’s flown beyond age 60, and all we ask is a way to do testing 
under  the  auspices  of  an  accredited  agency,  or  NASA,  or  someone, 
to get the facts and data about duty time limits, exactly what Cap-
tain Woerth’s talking about. I agree with a duty time limit, I abso-
lutely  do.  We  just  don’t  know  what  that  is,  because  today  in  the 
international  flight  rules  in  the  U.S.  you  can  fly  longer  than  you 
can  in  domestic  rules,  same  airplane,  same  crew.  We’d  just  like  to 
have  the  facts  and  data  to  make  a  good  decision  on  whether  we 
should  look  at  a  duty  time  limit  rather  than  a  number  of  flight 
hours limit, in other words, back to the 16-hour rule we were talk-
ing about a while ago. 

Senator  PRYOR.  OK,  I  appreciate  that  explanation,  but  do  you 
understand  how  an  ordinary  reasonable  person  might  look  at  your 
policies and say you are in favor of an older population flying your

aircraft,  and  also  want  them  to  be  able  to  fly  longer  in  the  same 
duty period. 

Mr. SPAIN. Only if we have facts and data to support it. 
Senator PRYOR. But in order to get the facts and data—— 
Mr. SPAIN. We would have to do testing, we’d have to find a way

fly. 

Mr. SPAIN. We’d have to find a way to do that, yes, sir. 
Senator PRYOR. Let me just ask, sort of the panel, generally, and 
I’m  just  going  to  throw  these  open,  and  I’m  not  saying  everybody 
has  to  answer,  but  if  you  want  to,  I’d  love  to  hear  your  answers 
on  this.  I  want  to  focus  a  little  bit  on  the  economic  ramifications 
of  changing  the  Rule,  and  some  of  you  covered  this  a  little  bit  in 
your statements, but how would extending the age limit beyond 60 
years impact younger and mid-level pilots, in terms of their oppor-
tunities for career advancement? 

Mr.  EICHELKRAUT.  What  I  found  is  pilots  who  have  not  made 
captain  yet  or  on  a  narrow-body  airplane  would  like  to  continue,  I 
think everybody wants the upgrade opportunities. In the near-term 
that  might  restrict  overtime  but  it  will  all  equalize  itself  out.  Nor-
mally  growth  opportunities  are  what  get  pilots  jobs,  not  retire-
ments.  I’ve  always  based,  promotions  come  when  airlines  are  suc-
cessful and grow. They can’t rely on pilots to retire to be successful 
in the airline business. 

Senator PRYOR. Anybody else? 
Mr. WOERTH. Senator, the question is a good one because it iden-
tifies the fact that there might be some differences of opinion based 
on  demographics.  And  I  agree  there  are,  and  in  fact  I  think  the 
ALPA  survey  or  poll  indicated  that  to  be,  in  particular,  the  case. 
The older guys want the Rule to be extended, and the younger guys 
want  to  keep  it  in  place.  But  there’s  an  assumption  in  that  state-
ment, and it has to do with a static environment. A lot of us joined 
our  airlines  with  the  hopes  that  it  stays  solvent,  that  it  continues 
for  years  and  years  that  over  the  years  we’ll  progress  up.  The  ad-
vantages  of  working  a  little  bit  longer  apply  to  everyone  who  is  in 
that  static  environment,  so  that  an  individual  might  be,  in  this 
case,  a  first  officer  in  our  airline,  he  might  have  to  wait  an  extra 
year  or  two  to  upgrade  him,  but  on  the  outside  years,  he  would 
have  the  extra  number  of  years  to  contribute  to  his  personal  fi-
nances  or  retirement,  those  issues.  One  of  the  issues  that  comes 
along,  also  with  this  question  is  for  those  people  who  are  fur-
loughed,  and  raising  the  age  for  those  individuals,  in  that  case, 
gives  them  an  opportunity  to  maybe  be  employed  elsewhere. 
There’s no guarantee that those individuals are ever going back to 
those carriers they came from, and it gives them an opportunity to 
work a little longer somewhere else rather than start over. 

Mr HUNTER. Yes, I think it is a very good question, Senator, cer-
tainly the facts that, again, it’s a question of who you ask the ques-
tion, and I think one thing we can probably all agree on in our pro-
fession is that timing is everything, if you’re hired at the beginning 
of  an  economic  boom,  you’re  destined  to  have  probably  a  very  dif-
ferent career than if you’re hired at the tail end of it, and certainly 
that  has  been  a  cycle  in  the  piloting  profession  as  I’ve  observed  it,

and  I  do  have  3,000  pilots  on  furlough  and  Captain  Woerth  men-
tioned this as well, who obviously have a very different view of this 
issue,  because  the  perception  is  that  this  rule  negatively  impacts 
their economics as well. 

Senator  PRYOR.  When  you  talk  about  negatively  impacting  their 
economics,  certainly  they  get  their  paycheck  when  they’re  flying, 
but  what  about  their  pensions?  Is  this,  changing  the  Age  60  Rule 
would it impact the pension situation with the airlines? 

Mr.  WOERTH.  The  current  crisis  we’re  facing  in  the  defined  ben-
efit  plan  which  is  being  looked  at  in  both  the  House  and  the  Sen-
ate,  because  that  crisis  is  the  money  that’s  already  earned  and  al-
ready  owed,  and  so  no  matter  what  happens  later,  that  does  not 
resolve  the  debited  deduction  contributions  that  are  currently  re-
quired. Certainly, a change in it would not affect their pension, but 
it  would  allow  people  to  work  longer  to  recover  some  of  the  money 
they  lost.  We’ve  also  had  issues  we’ve  tried  to  deal  with.  Senator 
Akaka  and  others  have  introduced  legislation  for  the  terminated 
pension plans, relating to pensions plans, the maximum a pilot can 
receive,  which  is  now  $29,000  as  opposed  to  other  workers  at 
$45,000 could be corrected, and we’ve always acknowledged that it 
has been tough for pilots for a long time to have a gap between So-
cial  Security  and  the  retirement  age,  whether  they’ve  lost  their 
pension or not. And that’s been unfair for pilots for some period of 
time. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Also,  staying  on  the  economics  of  all  this,  when 
pilots right now hit age 60, does that mean they are necessarily out 
of  a  job,  or  do  you  have  places  for  them  elsewhere  in  the  compa-
nies? Or the industry? 

Mr.  WOERTH.  Some  companies  do  provide  opportunities  in  the 
training departments, or other places where they’re not flying Part 
121 operations and other regulations that allow that, but the union 
doesn’t  provide  that,  it’s  certainly  a  management  decision,  we’re 
not involved with it. 

Mr.  EICHELKRAUT.  There  are  very  limited  positions  in  that  re-
gard,  I’d  also  like  to  bring  up  the  issue  that  these  pilots  who  are 
retiring  at  60  have  been  trained  in  Part  121  operations,  and  are 
well versed in that area and that experience they’re not allowed to 
pursue any longer, so are there other jobs in the aviation industry? 
Certainly  there  are,  you  can  start  over  in  other  places,  et  cetera, 
but  you  certainly  aren’t  doing  exactly  the  same  thing  you  were 
trained to do, up for sometimes 35 years. 

Mr.  SPAIN.  As  I  mentioned,  we  are  small  and  we  are  growing, 
and we have the need for the pilots to operate our airplanes under 
Part  91,  things  such  as  maintenance  test  flights,  delivery  flights, 
and  positioning  flights,  and  so  our  pilots  who  have  reached  60  are 
currently still flying with JetBlue. 

Senator  PRYOR.  The  last  question  I  have,  and  maybe  the  Chair-
man covered this, but I missed the answer, is the percentage of pi-
lots who actually hit age 60, I assume a number of them retire, or 
quit,  or  move  onto  something  else  before  they  hit  age  60,  so  what 
type of numbers or what percentage are we talking here? 

Mr.  WOERTH.  Within  the  ALPA,  there’s  only  one  group  of  ours 
that  we’ve  tracked  with  any  confidence,  and  that’s  Northwest  Air-
lines, since 1993 to now, has tracked every retirement, and it’s the

fourth  largest  airline  in  the  country  involved  in  wide-body  flying 
and  domestic  operations,  about  43  percent  of  the  pilots  retired 
early, either through medical disability and voluntarily, early. And 
that is out of 1,700 retirements since 1993. 

Senator PRYOR. So, as I understand those statistics, over half——

Senator  PRYOR.  So,  over  half  actually  hit  age  60  and  are  forced 

Mr. WOERTH. Yes. 
Senator PRYOR. Thank you. 
Senator  BURNS.  I  have  one  more  question,  one  last  question.  If 
the Age 60 Rule is changed, what other legal or regulatory changes 
should  there  be?  Will  this  have  a  ripple  effect  we  have  to  change 
in some other areas? Does anyone want to comment on that? 

Mr. WOERTH. You’ve asked the $64,000 question for most airline 
pilots.  What  we’ve  certainly  found  out  in  our  poll,  a  lot  of  us  are 
good old country boys, too. They don’t want to buy a pig in a poke, 
they’d like to know ‘‘what am I voting on?’’ and what they’ve asked 
us  is,  if  everything  is  going  to  stay  the  same,  that  would  be  one 
question. But they’ve watched these hearings previously, and heard 
what  the  FAA  said,  they’re  going  to  change  something  to  have  an 
equivalent  level  of  safety,  we  need  to  do  something,  they  like  to 
know  what  that  ‘‘something’’  is.  And  since  they  don’t  know,  a  lot 
of them would like to work longer. I think that has been clear, but 
they  would  like  to  know  that  whatever  changes  the  FAA  proposes 
is not a career threat to them, they don’t want any additional check 
rides,  they  don’t  want  to  be  an  astronaut,  they  don’t  want  to  take 
an  astronaut’s  physical  just  to  fly  to  Minneapolis,  but  they  would 
certainly  like  to  know  or  have  the  FAA  give  some  indication  what 
they’re  thinking  about,  because  right  now  we  don’t  know  what 
you’re  thinking  about,  and  that’s  a  concern  of  those  who  might 
change  their  mind,  or  those  who  would  continue,  they  don’t  know 
what those changes might be. 

Senator BURNS. Yes, sir? 
Mr.  EICHELKRAUT.  Senator,  the  ICAO  is  recommending  to  go  to 
a standard, I know, and one of those requirements they would like 
to  see  is  go  to  twice  a  year  medical  physicals,  of  course,  the  Class 
One  physical  they  already  do  in  this  country,  so  I  wouldn’t  see  a 
change  in  that  part,  what  I  would  suggest  though,  that  it  would 
certainly help in changing this age, it would certainly help us blend 
with the rest of the world in terms of commerce. 

Senator BURNS. Captain Hunter? 
Mr.  HUNTER.  Part  of  the  difficulty  in  answering  that  question, 
Mr.  Chairman,  is,  we’d  like  to  see  whatever  is  necessary  to  main-
tain  the  current  level  of  safety,  our  difficulty  in  answering  the 
question  well  characterizes  our  concern  with  changing  the  Rule  in 
the first place, I don’t think we have a good idea about what would 
need  to  be  changed  in  order  to  maintain  the  level  of  safety,  and 
that  precisely  characterizes  our  difficulty  with  changing  the  Rule. 

Senator BURNS. Captain Spain?

Mr.  SPAIN.  I  think  as  I’ve  mentioned  before,  I’d  really  like  to  be 
able  to  explore  that  and  get  the  facts  and  data  to  know  what  else 
would have to be changed, and we’d have to look at it in some way 
to see whether it’s test flying, whether it’s additional medicals, but 
we  need  to  know  what  else  has  to  be  changed,  and  the  only  way 
to do that we need to go get the facts and data. 

Senator  BURNS.  I  look  at  it  like  truck  driver,  CDLs.  In  other 
words,  if  you  change  it  from  60,  maybe  once  you  hit  that  60  level 
you  would  take  a  look  at  hours  of  service,  hours  in  the  air,  do  you 
require say, the first officer to be under 55, or whatever, and I won-
der does it lead to other rules and regulations that we would have 
to  look  at  in  order  to  extend  that  age,  that’s  what  I’m  looking  at. 
I think maybe, this is an issue that might have to be dealt when-
ever  we  reauthorize  the  FAA  next  year,  and  this  debate  will  con-
tinue, and we may know more about what the economic conditions 
are because we have an obligation, I think, I have an obligation to 
this  industry  to  first,  do  no  harm.  And  that’s  certainly  what  we’ll 
base our decisions on. I appreciate your testimony, and I appreciate 
you being very candid about it, because I just remarked to Senator 
Stevens  that  it’s  ironic  that  we  have  the  so-called  point-to-point 
carriers  wanting  it  extended,  the  legacy  carriers  are  on  the  other 
side  of  the  issue,  and  I’ll  sort  that  out  one  of  these  days  whenever 
I  have  a  little  time.  But  I  thank  you,  anybody  who  would  like  to 
submit  a  closing  statement,  you’re  welcome  to  do  that.  I  see  that 
it  is  almost  5:30,  that’s  not  dinner  time,  but  almost  is,  I’ve  never 
missed a meal yet, nor do I intend to. 

I  thank  you  for  your  service,  and  I  thank  you  for  testimony  and 

being candid with this committee. Thank you very much. 
[Whereupon, at 5:30 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

A P P E N D I X 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 
Today, we are once again weighing the pros and cons of changing the commercial 
airline  pilot  retirement  age  in  the  U.S.  This  is  not  a  new  issue,  as  the  Senate  has 
considered the matter on several occasions over the past 10 years. 

We  must  be  very  careful  before  taking  steps  to  change  the  long  standing  Age  60 
rule, and make certain that any modification does not negatively impact commercial 
aviation safety in the U.S. 

The  Age  60  rule  has  been  in  effect  and  worked  well  since  1959,  to  ensure  that 
we maintain the highest level of airline safety. The Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA)  has  reviewed  the  Rule  numerous  times,  and  medical  and  scientific  authori-
ties,  including  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH),  have  studied  it  repeatedly. 
To  date,  no  research  has  conclusively  determined  that  repealing  the  law  would  im-
prove aviation safety. 

Some  contend  that  extending  the  Age  60  rule  will  provide  economic  benefits  to 
the  aviation  industry  and  the  individual  pilots.  Obviously,  a  rule  change  would 
mean  that  some  pilots  could  extend  their  earning  potential  for  a  few  additional 
years, and given that most have had their benefits cut, I understand and appreciate 
their keen interest. 

However, the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), the world’s largest pilots union, 
voted  on  this  issue  recently  and  rejected  the  proposal,  while  some  of  the  Nation’s 
major air carriers have expressed concerns about how the change would affect their 
labor costs. 

I believe the current effort to increase the pilot age in the current economic envi-
ronment is particularly untimely. Ever since September 11, 2001, the major air car-
riers  have  faced  pronounced  financial  difficulty  and  have  been  forced  to  furlough 
thousands  of  airline  pilots.  Changing  the  Age  60  rule  has  the  potential  to  further 
disrupt the careers of more junior pilots and could, quite possibly, impact the caliber 
of America’s future aviators. 

While  some  maintain  that  the  Age  60  Rule  is  discriminatory,  the  Rule  has  been 
reviewed  and  upheld  on  numerous  occasions  by  Federal  courts,  concluding  that  it 
does not violate age discrimination employment law. 

I  appreciate  the  Chairman’s  commitment  to  this  issue,  and  I  understand  that 
there  are  varying  medical  opinions  regarding  the  appropriate  retirement  age  for 
commercial airline pilots. However, without concrete evidence that the Rule change 
would  improve  safety,  absent  a  true  consensus  on  the  issue,  I  feel  that  we  must 
leave air safety to the regulatory experts at the FAA. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF AIRLINE PILOTS AGAINST AGE DISCRIMINATION (APAAD) 
Airline  Pilots  Against  Age  Discrimination  (APAAD)  is  a  grassroots  organization 
comprised of pilots flying for a variety of airlines engaged in Federal Aviation Regu-
lation,  Part  121  operations  as  well  as  other  interested  parties.  As  the  name  of  our 
organization indicates, we are opposed to age discrimination. Our goal is to see the 
elimination of the federally mandated, discriminatory regulation known as the ‘‘Age 
60 Rule.’’ 

Chairman  Burns,  thank  you  for  revisiting  this  onerous  regulation  that  has  been 
allowed to continue for some 45 years, denying the traveling public the safest pilots 
we have to offer, and denying these pilots the right to earn a living in their chosen 
profession. 

It  is  obvious  to  those  of  us  who  have  studied  the  origination  of  this  rule  in  1959, 
realize  that  this  was  a  political  favor  by  then  FAA  Administrator,  General  Pete 
Quesada,  so  that  his  friend,  C.R.  Smith  at  American  Airlines,  could  fire  his  older 
pilots.  Subsequent  Administrators  of  the  FAA  have,  for  some  unknown  reason,  felt 
compelled to defend the first Administrator’s back-office deal.

We  have  seen  a  whole  industry  develop  around  this  notion  that  the  older  pilot 
may  not  be  as  safe—wasting  an  untold  amount  of  resources.  The  FAA  supports  its 
Age 60 Rule based on psuedo-science and theoretical conjecture, and has never prov-
en that the Age 60 Rule enhances public safety! 

There have been countless studies and reviews about the Age 60 Rule, inside and 

outside of the FAA. The following are some examples of these studies. 

• FAA report number DOT/FAA/AM 94/22, known as the ‘‘Hilton Study.’’ ‘‘The re-
sults  present  a  converging  body  of  evidence  which  fail  to  support  a  hypothesis 
that accident rates increase at or about the age of 60 years.’’ 
• The John Hopkins School of Medicine study: ‘‘Age, Flight Experience, and Risk 
of Crash Involvement in a Cohort of Professional Pilots.’’ The headline announc-
ing the study results was ‘‘Older pilots OK to fly, study shows.’’ Their conclusion 
was:  ‘‘Our  study  indicates  that  chronologic  age  by  itself  has  little  bearing  on 
safety performance,’’ says Susan P. Baker, co-author of the study and Professor 
of Health Policy and Management at Johns Hopkins’ Bloomberg School of Pub-
lic Health. ‘‘What really matters are age-related changes, such as health status 
and flight experience.’’ 
• The Aerospace Medical Association (AsMA), after conducting a two-plus year re-
view of the literature concluded; ‘‘. . . that there is insufficient medical evidence 
and/or  accident  record  to  support  airline  pilot  restrictions  based  on  age  alone.’’ 

We have a real world study from Japan. 
• The  Japanese  Ministry  of  Transport  allowed  159  airline  pilots  to  fly  until  age 
63  to  generate  data—a  study  the  FAA  has  refused  to  conduct  here!  The  study: 
‘‘A  10-Year  Retrospective  Review  of  Airline  Transport  Pilots  Aged  60  to  63  in 
Japan.’’  Conclusion:  ‘‘The  review  suggests  that  the  aged  pilots  who  are  deemed 
medically  qualified  by  the  official  notice  criteria  are  flying  safely  without  mis-
hap incidence.’’ 

The FAA had a chance to gather real world data in the United States, when FAR 
Part  135  pilots  past  age  60  were  grandfathered  for  4  years  as  they  operated  under 
FAR Part 121 in 1995. 

• Captain  Robert  Perry,  an  FAA  designated  check  airman,  surveyed  a  group  of 
these  age  60-plus  pilots  at  his  airline.  These  pilots  were  flying  the  more  rig-
orous  trips  in  the  turbo-props  and  regional  jets.  This  group,  whose  oldest  was 
71, flew over 100,000 accident/incident free hours. 

With  most  of  the  industrialized  world  permitting  their  airline  pilots  to  fly  past 
age 60, the body of anecdotal data overwhelmingly supports the safety of such oper-
ations.  In  fact,  the  FAA  has  a  double  standard  when  it  comes  to  the  Age  60  Rule. 
The  FAA  allows  age  60-plus  United  States  pilots  to  fly  in  FAR  Parts  91,  125,  and 
135  in  this  country.  The  FAA  also  allows  age  60-plus  foreign  airline  copilots  to  fly 
into this country—which our age 60-plus copilots cannot do. 

The  FAA  relies  on  its  Civil  Aerospace  Medical  Institute  (CAMI)  reports  to  justify 
its  position  that  the  Age  60  Rule  is  safety-based.  The  curious  observation  is  that 
CAMI Report 4 shows an accident rate for pilots younger than 30, 21⁄2 times higher 
than  pilots  in  the  age  50  to  age  60  group.  The  obvious  question  is—If  safety  is  the 
issue, why is there not an ‘‘Age 30 Rule’’ to prevent younger pilots from flying FAR 
121 operations? 

The ghost of General Pete Quesada still occupies 800 Independence Avenue. It is 
time for Congress to exorcise this demon and return sanity to this bureaucratic mal-
aise.  It  is  time  for  Congress  to  give  the  flying  public  our  most  experienced  aviators 
and these aviators a chance to earn a living in their chosen profession. 

The best safety device on our Nation’s airliners is an experienced pilot!

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO. 
Washington, DC, July 27, 2005 

Hon. CONRAD BURNS, 
Chairman, 
Senate Subcommittee on Aviation, 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, 
Washington, DC. 
Dear Mr. Chairman, 

On  behalf  of  Southwest  Airlines,  I  request  that  this  letter  and  the  attached  legal 
brief  be  made  a  part  of  the  formal  record  for  the  July  19th  hearing,  convened  by 
the  Senate  Subcommittee  on  Aviation  to  consider  the  FAA’s  controversial  ‘‘Age  60’’ 
Rule. The Age 60 Rule requires all commercial pilots employed by Part 121 air car-
riers to retire at the age of 60, regardless of individual pilot abilities or health condi-
tions. 

The  attached  brief  was  filed  with  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  as  a  ‘‘Friend  of  the 
Court’’  in  the  case  of  Butler,  et  al.  v.  Federal  Aviation  Administration.  The  Peti-
tioners in the Butler case challenged the FAA’s rigid application of the Age 60 rule. 
As is more fully explained in the brief, Southwest Airlines maintains that the Age 
60  rule,  coupled  with  the  FAA’s  practice  of  automatically  denying  all  pilot  requests 
for  exemptions  regardless  of  merit,  is  arbitrary  and  unfair  to  our  individual  pilots, 
and it is economically harmful to our company. Exemptions for physically and men-
tally  qualified  pilots  from  the  Age  60  Rule  should  be  allowed  to  accomplish  the 
FAA’s dual statutory mandates of maximum safety and optimal efficiency in United 
States commercial aviation. 

We  appreciate  the  Subcommittee’s  consideration  of  this  important  issue.  Please 

feel free to contact us if you have any questions.

Interest of Amicus Curiae 

Southwest  Airlines  Co.  (hereafter  ‘‘Southwest’’  or  ‘‘Southwest  Airlines’’),  the  larg-
est commercial airline in the United States in terms of passengers boarded, provides 
point-to-point,  low-fare  service  to  60  cities  in  31  states.  In  operation  since  1971, 
Southwest  currently  serves  more  than  70  million  passengers  annually  with  a  fleet 
of  over  400  Boeing  737  aircraft  operating  approximately  2,900  flights  daily. 
Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, Southwest has approximately 31,000 employees na-
tionwide and has one of the best overall customer service records in the U.S. airline 
industry.  With  annual  revenues  exceeding  $6,500,000,000  in  2004,  Southwest  is  a 
Fortune 500 company and one of the few profitable U.S. airlines.

Southwest  is  directly  impacted  by  this  case  because  it  employs  over  4,500  pilots, 
many  approaching  the  age  of  60.  In  fact,  Michael  L.  Oksner,  a  Petitioner  in  this 
case,  was  recently  forced  to  retire  from  Southwest  Airlines  when  the  Federal  Avia-
tion  Administration  (FAA)  denied  his  petition  for  an  exemption  from  the  ‘‘Age  60 
Rule.’’  That  rule,  codified  at  14  CFR  § 121.383(c),  requires  pilots  operating  under 
Part  121  of  the  FAA’s  regulations  (i.e.,  virtually  all  U.S.  commercial  airline  pilots) 
to retire on their 60th birthday. 

The direction and authority to evaluate this case and to file an amicus curiae brief 
herein  came  from  Herbert  D.  Kelleher,  co-founder  and  Executive  Chairman  of  the 
Board of Southwest Airlines. 
Summary of Amicus Argument 

Southwest  Airlines  urges  the  Supreme  Court  to  grant  certiorari  as  requested  by 
the Petitioners in this case, Butler, et al. v. Federal Aviation Administration, et al., 
D.C.  Cir.  No.  03–1386  (September  24,  2004).  The  Petitioners  challenge  the  FAA’s 
rigid  application  of  its  Age  60  Rule,  which  requires  all  commercial  pilots  employed 
by Part 121 air carriers to retire at the age of 60, regardless of individual pilot abili-
ties or health conditions. The current Age 60 Rule was adopted by the FAA 45 years 
ago,  and  is  based  on  obsolete  data  that  has  been  superceded  and  refuted  by  more 
recent medical findings. This rule, coupled with the FAA’s practice of automatically 
denying  all  pilot  requests  for  exemptions  regardless  of  merit,  is  arbitrary  and  inju-
rious to Southwest Airlines. Exemptions for physically and mentally qualified pilots 
from  the  Age  60  Rule  should  be  allowed  to  accomplish  the  FAA’s  dual  statutory 
mandates  of  maximum  safety  and  optimal  efficiency  in  United  States  commercial 
aviation.  The  court  below  erred  in  acceding  to  the  FAA’s  argument  that  the  case 
should not even be heard on the merits. 
Amicus Argument 
I.  The  FAA’s  Application  of  the  Age  60  Rule  Without  Consideration  of  Individual 

Pilot Abilities, Health Conditions, or Current Medical Data Is Not Justified 

The FAA’s practice of automatically denying all pilot requests for exemption from 
the Age 60 Rule is not medically justified. The mandatory retirement rules for pilots 
were established in 1959—45 years ago. Today, FAA data shows that pilots over age 
60 are as safe as, and in some cases safer than, their younger colleagues. For exam-
ple,  the  FAA  released  the  Hilton  Study  in  1993,  which  stated  ‘‘the  data  for  all 
groups  of  pilots  were  remarkably  consistent  in  showing  a  modest  decrease  in  acci-
dent  rate  with  age  [and]  no  hint  of  an  increase  in  accident  rates  as  pilots  near  age 
60.’’ 2 In  addition,  the  National  Institute  of  Aging  stated,  in  1981,  that  ‘‘the  Age  60 
Rule  appears  indefensible  on  medical  grounds’’  and  ‘‘there  is  no  convincing  medical 
evidence  to  support  age  60,  or  any  other  specific  age,  for  mandatory  pilot  retire-
ment.’’ 3 Both medical technology and medical services, as well as the aging process 
itself,  have  dramatically  improved  since  1959.  Southwest  Airlines  is  familiar  with, 
and  agrees  with,  these  medical  studies  which  have  concluded  that  there  is  no  cur-
rent  health  justification  for  automatically  grounding  all  commercial  airline  pilots 
upon turning age 60. 

Captain Joseph ‘‘Ike’’ Eichelkraut, President of Southwest Airlines Pilots’ Associa-
tion,  and  a  pilot  with  25  years  of  experience  flying  both  military  and  commercial 
aircraft, testified on the Age 60 Rule before the Senate Special Committee on Aging 
on  September  14,  2004.4 His  testimony  explains  the  many  safeguards  that  are  al-
ready in place to ensure pilots of all ages are healthy and medically fit to fly: 

The  FAA  already  has  the  ideal  mechanisms  in  place  for  ensuring  safe  pilots  at 
any  age . . . To  retain  my  license  and  fly  for  Southwest  Airlines,  I  must  pass 
semi-annual  flight  physicals,  administered  by  an  FAA  licensed  medical  exam-
iner, that include an annual EKG. I must also demonstrate complete knowledge 
of safe piloting skills, systems and procedures, and semiannual check rides and 
advanced simulators. 
Pilots  must  also  successfully  pass  semiannual  simulator  training  and  flight 
checks designed to evaluate the crewmember’s ability to respond to various air-
craft  emergencies  and/or  competently  handle  advances  in  flight  technology  and 
the  Air  Traffic  Control  environment . . . There  is  no  greater  test  of  cognitive

ability  and  mental  dexterity  than  these  simulator  rides . . . The  59  year  old 
Captain  arrives  at  this  point  in  his  career  having  demonstrated  successful  per-
formance following years of this kind of scrutiny. FAA studies have verified the 
superior level of safety exhibited by this senior captain. 

The  documentary  evidence—disclosed  in  the  record  of  this  case—reveals  that  the 
FAA’s  automatic  denial  of  all  age  exemptions  has  no  tangible  safety  purpose.  The 
FAA itself even granted exemptions from the Age 60 Rule in the early 1990s to com-
mercial pilots of foreign carriers. Because the undistorted data of pilot performance 
shows that older, more experienced pilots have excellent safety records, it clearly is 
in  the  interest  of  both  the  airlines  and  their  passengers  to  allow  qualified,  medi-
cally-certified pilots to fly beyond age 60. 
II.  The  FAA’s  Inflexible  Application  of  the  Age  60  Rule  Undermines  U.S.  Airline 

Economics and Disserves the Traveling Public. 

The  1950s-era  Age  60  Rule,  coupled  with  the  FAA’s  rigid  implementation  of  it, 
arbitrarily deprives Southwest Airlines of some of its best pilots at the peak of their 
careers.  Southwest,  which  employs  over  4,500  highly-skilled  professional  pilots,  be-
lieves that the arbitrary rejection of all age exemption requests disserves the public 
interest  by  depriving  commercial  airlines  of  leadership  and  experience  in  the  cock-
pit.  This  inflexible  approach  inhibits  the  industry  from  achieving  maximum  safety 
as  well  as  optimal  efficiency  in  passenger  airline  operations.  The  flight  experience 
and training accumulated over the career of a professional pilot approaching the age 
of  60,  along  with  the  investment  in  training  by  that  pilot’s  airline  employer  such 
as  Southwest,  is  enormous.  Commercial  pilots  have  the  potential  for  years  of  safe, 
productive  aviating  ahead  of  them  beyond  their  60th  birthday.  Many  airlines  could 
operate more efficiently, while maintaining the highest standards of safety, if quali-
fied pilots were allowed to continue to fly beyond age 60. 

Southwest  Airlines  Captain  Michael  L.  Oksner,  one  of  the  12  Petitioners  in  this 
case,  was  forced  to  retire  on  his  60th  birthday,  April  5,  2004,  because  of  the  FAA’s 
denial of his individual Age 60 exemption request. Captain Oksner’s safety perform-
ance  and  medical  records  were  unblemished.  Southwest  believes  that  he  should 
have  been  granted  an  exemption  by  the  FAA  to  continue  flying.  The  Petitioners  in 
this  case,  including  Captain  Oksner,  should  have  their  requests  for  exemption  con-
sidered on the merits, not arbitrarily denied by the FAA. The Agency should be re-
quired to reach its decision on such exemption requests based on the safety perform-
ance  and  medical  records  of  the  individual  pilots,  not  on  an  arbitrary,  out-dated 
standard  that  the  FAA  imposes  on  all  pilots  regardless  of  individual  abilities.  Ac-
cordingly,  we  urge  the  Court  to  grant  de  novo  review  of  the  Petitioners’  case,  and 
require  the  FAA  to  follow  a  reasoned  standard  of  individual  consideration  of  Age 
60  Rule  exemption  requests,  pursuant  to  the  Agency’s  statutory  power  to  grant  ex-
emptions from its regulations when in the public interest (49 U.S.C. § 44701(f)). 

Moreover,  the  FAA  has  a  statutory  duty  to  consider  exemptions  in  light  of  para-
mount  safety  requirements  in  air  commerce,  pursuant  to  49  U.S.C.  § 40101(a)(1). 
Without  lessening  safety,  the  FAA  also  has  a  duty  to  consider  the  economic  health 
and  efficiency  of  the  Nation’s  air  carriers  pursuant  to  49  U.S.C.  §§ 40101(a)(6)(A) 
(the  FAA  shall  consider  it  in  the  public  interest  ‘‘to  encourage  efficient  and  well- 
managed  air  carriers  to  earn  adequate  profits . . .’’);  and  40101(a)(7)  (it  is  in  the 
public  interest  for  FAA  to  develop  and  maintain  ‘‘a  sound  regulatory  system  that 
is  responsive  to  the  needs  of  the  public  . . .’’).  Southwest  Airlines’  analysis  of  the 
issue  has  concluded  that  safer  and  more  efficient  operations  will  result  from  rea-
soned consideration—instead of arbitrary denial—of age exemption requests. There-
fore,  Southwest  Airlines  believes  that  the  Petitioners’  case  must  be  heard,  for  the 
sake of both the health of U.S. commercial aviation and the safety of the flying pub-
lic. 

The  FAA’s  arbitrary  no-exemptions  policy  for  commercial  airline  pilots  should  be 
ended,  consistent  with  the  public  interest  in  air  safety,  because  it  serves  no  safety 
purpose. Pilots of smaller aircraft such as those operating under Parts 91 and 125– 
137, general aviation pilots, and certain test pilots are allowed to fly beyond age 60. 
In  addition,  at  least  24  nations  allow  pilots  to  fly  commercial  aircraft  past  age  60.5 
These pilots share the same airways and runways with the large U.S. passenger air-
lines  operating  under  Part  121.  The  safe  performance  of  these  pilots  and  others 
worldwide confirms that the FAA’s asserted claim of a safety basis for its no-exemp-
tions policy for Part 121 pilots is unfounded.

Conclusion 

For  the  foregoing  reasons,  Southwest  Airlines  urges  the  Supreme  Court  to  grant 

certiorari to the Petitioners in this case. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF BERT M. YETMAN, PRESIDENT, 

PROFESSIONAL PILOTS FEDERATION 

Introduction 

The Professional Pilots Federation (PPF) has, since being established in 1991, rep-
resented pilots encumbered by FAR 121.383(c), known as the Age 60 Rule. This Fed-
eral  Aviation  Regulation  forces  the  safest,  most  experienced  pilots  from  our  airline 
cockpits  at  59  years,  364  days.  regardless  of  health  or  competence.  Although  the 
Federal  Aviation  Administration  has  held  the  regulation  to  be  a  ‘‘safety  rule,’’  the 
evidence has shown that the Rule was promulgated as an economic favor to the air-
lines.  Safety  was  the  only  ‘‘fortress’’  which  would  allow  such  a  Rule  to  endure  for 
45  years.  44  or  more  nations  have  eliminated  age  60  as  a  pilot  retirement  age  and 
have no age limit, or 65. relying on medical and practical testing (simulator and en 
route checks). They have experienced no problems with the over-60 pilots. 
Airline Crisis 

No one would deny that the American airline industry is suffering one of its worst 
crises  ever.  Many  familiar  airlines  have  disappeared.  Still  others  are  fighting  for 
their very existence, such as legacy carriers US Airways, United Airlines and Delta. 
American  Airlines  is  struggling  to  keep  its  head  above  financial  waters.  A  1993 
study  showed  one  of  these  carriers,  now  in  bankruptcy,  would  save  more  than 
$53,000,000  for  each  year  the  age  Rule  was  extended,  mostly  in  training  costs  for 
upgrading to replace the retiring captain. 

Through  collective  bargaining  agreements.  pilots  salaries  are  no  longer  a  factor 
in the economic maintenance of the Age 60 Rule. After 12 years, a pilot has reached 
the top of the seniority pay increase scale. Equipment changes and contractual nego-
tiations  are  his  only  salary  increases.  The  single  economic  reason  for  implementa-
tion of an Age 60 Rule has gone the way of the dinosaur. 
Airline Pensions 

Employee  pensions  have  been  hard  hit  by  airline  management’s  striving  to  cut 
costs. Pilot pensions, in particular, have been the hardest hit. Employee concessions, 
negotiated over the past few years, have not been enough to satisfy airline financial 
losses.  Airlines  entering  bankruptcy  are  defaulting  on  underfunded  pension  plans, 
in  turn  placing  the  substantial  financial  burden  on  the  Pension  Benefit  Guaranty 
Corporation (PBGC). Even this is not an assurance of a comfortable retirement, cer-
tainly not the retirement expected after many years of faithful airline employment. 
In  some  cases  pilots  are  expected  to  receive  1⁄3 or  less  of  their  anticipated  pension, 
and that may be reduced further by the PBGC policy of reducing payments for early 
retirement,  which  pilots  are  forced  to  take  upon  reaching  age  60.  Those  closest  to 
retirement are in the worst position, with no time to recoup losses even if they were 
allowed  to  continue  their  careers.  A  total  restructuring  of  retirement  planning  is 
necessary for those retirees, with the selling of homes, scaling down of living stand-
ards, acquiring medical coverage, the expenses of college age children, etc. 

Social Security does not help airline pilots at age 60 retirement. In fact they will 
lose  benefits  for  each  quarter  year  they  fail  to  contribute.  In  other  words,  after 
many  years  of  contributing  at  the  highest  possible  level,  their  benefits  will  decline 
for  each  year  of  noncontributing  until  Social  Security  begins.  And,  of  course.  Medi-
care  is  unavailable  until  reaching  65.  At  age  65,  that  would  be  20  quarters  of  re-
duced benefit, or hundreds of dollars each month. The only solution to that problem 
is to find alternate means of work. Not an easy task at age 60. 
Conclusion 

The  answer  to  this  45-year-old  antiquated,  illogical,  and  unfounded  problem  of 
FAA forced retirement for pilots is simple. Follow Europe, Australia, Japan, and the 
rest of the world (the USA used to lead) by allowing pilots to continue their careers 
at  least  until  full  Social  Security  and  Medicare  benefits  begin,  presently  age  65.  If 
they  choose  to  retire  at  55  or  60,  it  should  be  allowed  without  unnecessary  restric-
tions or undue loss of benefits. Certainly present medical and proficiency standards 
would still apply.

According to the 1993 study * titled Economic Impact of the FAA’s ‘‘Age 60 Rule’’, 
if  pilots  were  allowed  to  continue  beyond  their  60th  birthday,  the  realized  annual 
savings at one major carrier, now in bankruptcy, would have been: 

Real Permanent Savings: 

Staffing levels: $2,251,320.00 
Pay differentials: $16,380,000.00 
Temporarily Deferred Expenditures: 
Training costs: $34,579,124.00 

Savable/Deferrable in 1993: $53,210,444.00 

Those  savings  would  have  easily  exceeded  $250  million  over  5  years  for  just  this 
one carrier, largely through savings in transition training costs—which are available 
to most carriers. 

The  Professional  Pilots  Federation  thanks  you  for  the  opportunity  to  allow  pilots 
to be part of the solution, not the problem. We wish to continue supporting our air-
lines.  We  wish  to  continue  contributing  to  Social  Security.  We  wish  to  continue  to 
bolster the economy of this great country. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF AARP 

AARP  appreciates  the  opportunity  to  present  its  views  regarding  mandatory  re-
tirement rules for airline pilots for the record of the July 19 hearing, before the Sen-
ate Subcommittee on Aviation. 

With  more  than  35  million  members,  AARP  is  the  largest  organization  rep-
resenting  the  interests  of  Americans  age  50,  and  older,  and  their  families.  Nearly 
half  of  AARP  members  are  working  either  full-time  or  part-time,  and  they  have  a 
vital interest in remaining on the job or finding work—without facing age discrimi-
nation by their employers. 

Protecting and expanding older workers’ rights was a founding principle of AARP. 
Today, AARP is the leading organization advocating for older workers at the Federal 
and  state  court  levels,  before  Congress  and  state  legislatures,  and  before  enforce-
ment agencies. AARP works closely with other organizations seeking fair treatment 
for  those  in  the  workforce.  In  addition,  we  work  with  employers  to  develop  policies 
that  enhance  opportunities  for,  and  eliminate  discrimination  against,  the  ever-in-
creasing number of workers who stay on the job past age 55. 

AARP  is  pleased  that  the  Subcommittee  is  holding  this  hearing  to  take  a  look  at 
the  outdated  policies  surrounding  mandatory  retirement  for  pilots.  Elimination  of 
forced  retirement  based  on  age  is  long  overdue,  and  it  is  AARP’s  hope  that  today’s 
hearing  will  lead  to  the  speedy  enactment  of  legislation  to  end  arbitrary  age  limits 
for pilots who must retire at age 60. 

Discrimination on the job is one of the most common problems faced by older per-
sons  today.  Employment  discrimination  based  on  age,  like  that  based  on  race  and 
sex, is the result of unfair stereotypical assumptions that ignore an individual work-
er’s  ability.  Not  withstanding  the  Age  Discrimination  in  Employment  Act  (ADEA), 
age-based employment discrimination remains prevalent. Older workers face sharp-
ly  limited  employment  opportunities.  In  addition  to  a  rapidly  increasing  unemploy-
ment level among older persons, labor statistics indicate that among persons looking 
for  work,  older  persons  have  longer  periods  of  unemployment  and  more  difficulty 
finding jobs. 

Congress  passed  the  ADEA,  in  1967,  to  eliminate  discrimination  on  the  basis  of 
age  and  to  promote  employment  of  older  persons  because  of  an  individual’s  ability 
to carry out a job’s duties. This landmark employment law did not affect airline pi-
lots  who  are  subject  to  a  1959  FAA  rule,  requiring  they  stop  flying  at  age  60.  This 
46-year-old rule continues to be in effect, even though there is no sound justification 
for it. 

The most frequently articulated argument to justify continuing the age-based em-
ployment  discrimination  for  commercial  pilots  is  medical.  This  argument  does  not 
hold  water,  however.  Medical  evidence  consistently  shows  that  chronological  age  is 
a  poor  determinant  of  ability,  and  that  capability  varies  among  individuals  inde-
pendent of age. The medical and scientific means exist to test individual fitness for 
jobs.  Regular  fitness  testing  is  not  a  new  concept;  it  is  already  in  force  for  airline 
pilots.  They  are  subject  to  periodic  medical  certification  and  successful  completion 
of flight simulator exercises.

Although the FAA has statutory authority to grant exemptions to the Rule in the 
public interest, it has never done so. Challenges to the age 60 rule, and to the FAA’s 
refusal to grant any exemptions from it, have been unsuccessful over the years. Per-
haps  this  year  the  arbitrary  age  limit  will  be  overturned  in  favor  of  sound  policy 
recognizing that years of experience, good judgment, and conformance with objective 
performance and medical criteria are much better indicators of a pilot’s competence. 
AARP supports S. 65, sponsored by Senator James M. Inhofe and its companion bill. 
H.R.  65,  sponsored  by  Representative  Jim  Gibbons.  Both  bills  would  link  pilot  re-
tirement  with  the  normal  retirement  age  under  Social  Security.  S.  65  and  H.R.  65 
take an important step toward eliminating the mandatory retirement age for pilots. 
The  current  age  cap  on  employment  for  commercial  airline  pilots  is  contrary  to 
the principles of equal opportunity and treatment. Furthermore, it is a waste of val-
uable  skills  and  experiences.  Federal  law  should  not  deny  capable  individuals  the 
right  to  work  based  on  out-dated,  invalid,  and  discriminatory  assumptions  about 
older  workers.  Mandatory  retirement  based  on  age  should  be  eliminated—not  just 
for  those  whose  employment  situation  is  addressed  by  the  hearing  today—but  for 
anyone who is subject to arbitrary age limits. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS,

The  International  Brotherhood  of  Teamsters,  Airline  Division,  represents  40,000 
aviation  employees,  including  over  7,000  air  transport  pilots  (ATPs).  Our  organiza-
tion supports changing the Age 60 Rule, and urges Congress to pass S. 65 and H.R. 
65, legislation introduced by Senator James Inhofe and by Congressman James Gib-
bons, respectively. 

The  Federal  Aviation  Regulation  at  14  C.F.R.  § 121.383(c),  commonly  referred  to 
as  the  Age  60  Rule,  is  a  simplistic  rule  for  a  complex  problem.  The  Age  60  Rule, 
enacted  in  December  1959,  and  effective  in  March  1960,  was  the  subject  of  con-
troversy  then,  and  has  remained  so  throughout  the  past  45  years.  From  its  incep-
tion,  the  Rule  has  been  the  focus  of  numerous  inconclusive  studies,  several  subse-
quent  rulemaking  proceedings,  many  court  battles,  and  occasional  legislative  at-
tempts to overturn or modify it. 

Once again, the Age 60 Rule is in the spotlight. A confluence of events in the avia-
tion  industry  (e.g.,  9/11,  fuel  prices,  chronic  industry  mismanagement,  etc.)  that 
have resulted in bankruptcies, wage concessions, the freezing of pensions and/or the 
transfer of pension plans to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), and 
the resultant unexpected loss of income for pilots who face retirement in the imme-
diate  or  near  future,  have  refocused  attention  on  the  issue  of  forced  retirement  for 
pilots flying under Part 121. 

The  Teamsters  Airline  Division  supports  the  proposed  legislation,  which  would 
permit  pilots  to  fly  until  age  65.  At  the  same  time  however.  we  advocate  that  the 
legislation be amended to include two additional components: (1) pension protection 
for  those  pilots  retiring  or  required  to  retire  at  age  60  for  medical  or  other  reasons 
(such  protection  could  be  temporary  and  designed  to  phaseout  over  period  of  10  to 
15 years), including adjustments to PBGC and Social Security rules to accommodate 
the new mandatory retirement age: and (2) an independent longitudinal study of the 
correlation between aviation safety and pilot age. 

The  Age  60  Rule  was  promulgated  in  response  to  the  air  carriers’  desires  and 
needs,  rather  than  any  demonstrable  safety  concerns.  Fifty  years  later,  however, 
this  issue  is  no  longer  relevant  except  to  explain  the  Federal  Aviation  Administra-
tion’s  (FAA)  dogged  reluctance  to  modify  the  Rule.  The  Committee  should  instead 
consider:  (1)  the  meager  scientific  evidence  cited  to  support  the  Age  60  Rule  when 
it was first issued; (2) the lack of credible evidence used to defend the Rule through-
out  its  many  legal,  legislative,  and  regulatory  challenges;  and  (3)  the  FAA’s  contin-
ued  intransigence  in  view  of  emerging  scientific  evidence  regarding  aging  and  cog-
nition. The FAA’s policy is undermined by its highly selective, inconsistent, and spe-
cious application of the scientific literature. 

An  objective  review  of  pertinent  literature  makes  it  clear  that  age  is  neither  a 
valid nor reliable predictor of a pilot’s ability to fly a transport aircraft safely. Rath-
er, the pilot’s individual health and cognitive status, as well as training, skill, expe-
rience,  and  demonstrated  proficiency,  best  determine  suitability  for  active  ATP  sta-
tus.  Even  the  FAA’s  own  Civil  Aerospace  Medical  Institute  (CAMI)  investigators, 
after having conducted an extensive review of selective literature from 1990 to 1999, 
noted, ‘‘the vast majority of the scientists who have subsequently reviewed and com-
mented on the issues associated with the continued use of chronological age suggest

that there are better alternatives.’’ (Schroeder, et al., 2000) (emphasis added). ‘‘Better 
alternatives’’ would surely result in equal, if not superior, safety effects. 

Opponents have alleged that the Age 60 Rule was issued in response to a ‘‘sugges-
tion’’  from  then-Chairman  of  American  Airlines,  C.R.  Smith,  to  then-FAA  Adminis-
trator,  General  Elwood  Quesada,  that  ‘‘[I]t  may  be  necessary  for  the  regulatory 
agency  to  fix  some  suitable  age  for  retirement.  (Smith  letter  dated  February  5, 
1959).  The  Professional  Pilots  Federation  (PPF)  claimed  in  a  2002  petition  for  ex-
emption  that,  ‘‘the  age  60  rule  was  not  initiated  as  a  safety  measure’’  but  rather 
‘‘to force Smith’s older pilots into early retirement.’’ The FAA has denied these alle-
gations.  The  General  Accounting  Office  (GAO)  reported,  in  1989,  that  according  to 
the  FAA,  the  Rule  was  a  response  to  FAA  concerns  that  ‘‘the  use  of  pilots  aged  60 
and  over  in  air  carrier  operations  presented  a  safety  hazard’’  and  ‘‘this  concern 
emerged  as  major  airlines,  whose  practice  was  to  allow  senior  pilots  the  option  of 
flying the newest and largest aircraft, were making the transition to turbojets.’’ The 
‘‘FAA  reasoned  that  accidents  among  older  pilots,  although  not  a  problem  at  the 
time, could become one.’’ (GAO, 1989). Interestingly, the GAO also stated that it was 
not  age,  as  such  that  caused  the  FAA  concern,  but  rather  the  increased  frequency 
of impairing medical conditions associated with aging. 

Schroeder,  Harris,  and  Broach  (2002),  based  on  their  review  of  the  historical  lit-
erature,  reported  that  several  factors  drove  the  promulgation  of  the  Age  60  Rule. 
These included an aircraft accident involving a 59 year old pilot and a new genera-
tion  turbo  jet  aircraft,  the  supposed  difficulties  older  pilots  had  experienced  in 
transitioning to the new generation jet aircraft, the growing numbers of older pilots, 
and  the  increased  incidence  of  coronary  heart  disease  in  older  adults,  resulting  in 
a  greater  probability  for  sudden  incapacitation  in  older  pilots.  They  also  noted  that 
the  FAA  was  concerned  with  the  ‘‘subtle  consequences  of  age’’  that  might  have  a 
negative impact on pilot performance and judgment. 

The Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA) has agreed, at least for the 
past 25 years, with both the FAA’s account of the Rule’s origin and its scientific va-
lidity. In its comments to the docket on the PPF petition for exemption filed in Octo-
ber  2002,  ALPA  argued  that  the  PPF’s  claims  regarding  the  Rule’s  origin  ‘‘are  nei-
ther relevant nor supportable’’ and that ‘‘even if the Rule’s origin were questionable, 
those questions would have been cured by the Agency’s later proceedings.’’ (Empha-
sis  added.)  Ironically,  ALPA’s  support  of  the  Rule  is  at  odds  with  its  original  posi-
tion on the issue; it was ALPA who filed the first legal case against the Age 60 Rule, 
because it strongly opposed the Rule for 20 years. 

When  ALPA  sued  the  FAA,  it  claimed  that  the  Rule:  ‘‘(1)  was  outside  the  rule-
making power of the Administrator; (2) could not be promulgated without a hearing, 
as required by either the Constitution or the Administrative Procedure Act; (3) was 
not  reasonable  related  to  safety  concerns;  and  (4)  was  arbitrary.’’  ALPA  v.  Ouesada, 
182  F.Supp.  595  (S.D.N.Y.  1960),  aff’d,  276  F.2d  892  (2d  Cir.  1960),  286  F.2d  319 
(2d Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 366 U.S. 962 (1961) (emphasis added); (GAO, 1989). The 
courts rejected ALPA’s arguments. 

ALPA’s remarks to the 2000 Age 60 docket notwithstanding, ALPA’s official publi-
cation,  Airline  Pilot,  recently  included  a  historical  synopsis  that  suggests  the  Rule 
had little to do with safety, and more to do with accommodating the carriers’ desires 
to  rid  themselves  of  older  pilots.  (Francis,  2005).  In  1958,  ALPA  signed  its  first  jet 
contract, with National Airlines. According to Francis, air carriers wanted to transi-
tion  into  jet  flying  quickly,  and  minimize  the  cost  by  using  younger  military  pilots 
who already had jet training and experience. FAA regulations did not limit a pilot’s 
age,  so  several  carriers  implemented  their  own  mandatory  retirement  age.  (Hol-
brook, 1974). When American, TWA, and Western airlines attempted to force pilots 
into  retirement  at  age  60,  these  policies  were  challenged  via  the  grievance  process. 
(Francis, 2005). The arbitrator in each case ruled in favor of the pilots. 

American  ignored  the  arbitrator’s  ruling  and  continued  to  enforce  mandatory  re-
tirement  at  age  60,  which  helped  lead  to  a  pilot  strike  from  December  20,  1958 
through  January  10,  1959.  American  finally  capitulated,  met  the  pilot’s  strike  de-
mands,  and  agreed  to  reinstate  three  captains  who  were  forced  to  retire.  After  the 
strike,  American  delayed  reinstating  the  pilots  and  its  Chairman  wrote  a  private 
letter to the FAA Administrator suggesting the need for a statutory retirement age. 
American also conducted a study of their pilots (which reported that older pilots re-
quired more training than younger pilots to transition from propeller to jet aircraft) 
to  substantiate  the  need  for  a  mandatory  retirement  age.  FAA  attorneys,  however, 
recommended  that  the  study  not  be  used  to  justify  age  limits,  and  advised  instead 
that the FAA use medical criteria to justify the Rule. (Francis, 2005). 

ALPA maintained its opposition to the Rule until 1980, arguing for 20 years that 
an  individual  pilot’s  mental  and  physical  abilities,  rather  than  an  arbitrary  age 
limit,  should  determine  fitness  for  flight.  ALPA  also  insisted  that  the  Age  60  Rule

was discriminatory, posed an economic hardship for pilots, was based on faulty evi-
dence,  and  that  subsequent  medical  evidence  refuted  the  FAA’s  premise  for  the 
Rule.  In  1971,  ALPA  engaged  the  services  of  four  internationally  recognized  physi-
cians to testify at a public hearing in opposition to the medical claims made by the 
FAA.  (Holbrook,  1974).  By  1980,  however,  ALPA’s  interests  had  shifted,  and  it  de-
cided to support Age 60 ‘‘in view of its relevance to contract items such as retirement 
benefits.’’  (Francis,  2005)  (emphasis  added).  ALPA  also  acknowledged  that  as  the 
number  of  younger  pilots  increased  proportionally  in  its  ranks,  the  importance  of 
overturning  the  Rule  diminished  since  these  younger  members  were  interested  in 
advancing  their  careers  by  moving  more  quickly  into  the  left  seat.  (Francis,  2005). 
In  testimony  before  this  committee  on  July  19,  2005,  ALPA,  speaking  in  opposi-
tion to the proposed legislation, asserted that the Age 60 Rule is based on ‘‘two fun-
damental  principles  of  medical  science  that  are  indisputable  . . .  the  risks  of  inca-
pacitation  and  unacceptable  decrements  in  performance  increase  with  age’’  and 
‘‘medical  science  has  not  developed  a  regimen  of  reliable  tests  that  can  be  adminis-
tered effectively to determine which aging pilots will become incapacitated, or whose 
performance will decline to an unacceptable level.’’ (Woerth, 2005). Both of these ar-
guments reflect those put forth by the FAA. Both are misleading. 

While  the  risk,  and  incidence  of  incapacitation  and  performance  decrement  in-
creases  with  age,  these  outcomes  are  not  inherently  linked  to  aging  as  is  implied. 
Research  on  aging  suggests  that  the  cognitive  decline  and  performance  impairment 
associated with aging is actually more a functional outcome of chronic disease, espe-
cially cardiovascular disease, than age per se. This relationship between disease and 
physical and cognitive decline is well established, and in fact, was recognized by the 
FAA’s own medical experts in the early 1960s (Balke, 1963; Spieth, 1964; and Wentz 
1964). 

Another  argument  the  FAA  offers  is  the  relationship  of  pilot  age  to  accidents 
based  on  several  studies  (Broach,  1999;  Golaszewski,  1983,  1991,  1993;  Kay, 
Hillman,  Hyland,  Voros,  Harris,  and  Deimler,  1994)  that  have  been  roundly  criti-
cized  for  methodological  and  analytical  flaws.  Notably,  none  of  these  studies  were 
published  in  peer-reviewed  journals,  but  were  still  referenced  in  the  FAA’s  testi-
mony before this Committee on July 19, 2005, and the FAA reiterated another often 
cited  justification  for  the  Rule:  ‘‘There  is  no  absolute,  scientific  formula  that  may 
be readily applied’’ to determining a pilot’s fitness for duty after age 60. 

The assertion by the FAA and supporters of the Age 60 Rule that medical science 
has not developed a ‘‘regimen of reliable tests’’ to identify pilots at risk for incapaci-
tation, or who might be cognitively impaired is at best disingenuous. Medical science 
has  come  a  long  way  since  1959.  The  medical  certification  requirements  and  pro-
ficiency  testing  protocols  for  ATPs  are  rigorous,  and  certainly  sufficient  to  identify 
pilots  at  risk  for  incapacitation  and  impaired  performance.  The  system  is  effective; 
the record speaks for itself. 

In  fact,  the  FAA  and  ALPA  extolled  the  validity  and  reliability  of  the  medical 
tests  and  proficiency  evaluations  imposed  by  the  FAA  and  air  carriers  when  they 
testified  in  April  2000,  before  the  Subcommittee  on  Aviation  in  the  U.S.  House  of 
Representatives,  on  issues  arising  out  of  the  crash  of  Egypt  Air.  At  that  hearing, 
ALPA  pointed  out  that  ‘‘Airline  pilots  are  certainly  the  most  frequently  tested  and 
monitored  professionals  in  the  world,  in  regard  to  physical  and  mental  health  as 
well as professional performance and competence.’’ (Woerth, 2000). Further, in argu-
ing  against  the  need  for  additional  psychological  testing  as  was  then  being  con-
templated,  ALPA  claimed  that  the  existing  medical  and  proficiency  evaluation  re-
quirements  provided  ‘‘ample  means’’  to  identify  impaired  pilots.  It  is  illogical  and 
inconsistent to now claim that these same medical and proficiency tests lose all va-
lidity  and  reliability  when  a  pilot  reaches  age  60.  While  opinion  and  self-interest 
(whether  based  on  membership  polls,  economic  necessity,  or  political  expediency) 
may change over time, fundamental scientific principles do not. 

Considering  the  relationship  between  pathology  and  performance  decrement/cog-
nitive decline, the reliability and validity of the FAA’s medical certification program 
for  air  transport  pilots  is  certainly  important.  Since  the  incidence  of  pathology  in-
creases  with  age,  one  would  expect  that  medical  disqualifications  of  pilots  would 
likewise increase with age, if the certification process was indeed valid and reliable. 
Additionally,  one  would  expect  that  the  initial  application  for  a  first-class  medical 
certificate would disqualify individuals with underlying health problems, and would 
result  in  a  ‘‘healthy  worker  effect’’  in  this  population.  Analysis  of  the  FAA  medical 
certification data supports both these hypotheses. 

The  age-specific  denial  rates  for  air  transport  pilots  are  compelling  evidence  that 
the  FAA  medical  screening  process  works  dependably  to  purge  the  ATP  population 
of persons with those pathologies most associated with cognitive impairment or risk 
for incapacitation. This information is not new. In the late 1960s, the FAA initiated

a  study  to  quantify  the  attributes  of  medical  certification  denials  in  an  effort  to 
identify standards that might need amendment, as well as specific pathologies that 
might  be  of  special  concern  in  the  aviation  environment.  (Siegel  &  Booze,  1968). 
While  this  initial  attempt  to  analyze  medical  denial  actions  does  not  provide  much 
insight  relative  to  ATPs  and  the  Age  60  Rule,  it  did  lay  important  groundwork  for 
later FAA studies. For example, Siegel and Booze noted that cardiovascular disease 
was  the  most  significant  medical  disqualification  factor  for  aviators.  Since  several 
FAA  researchers  (Balke,  1963;  Spieth,  1964;  and  Wentz  1964)  had  reported  a  rela-
tionship  between  cardiovascular  pathologies  and  cognitive  decline,  Booze’s  findings 
were  noteworthy  and  emphasized  the  importance  of  careful  screening  for  cardio-
vascular disease. 

In  1974,  Booze  conducted  another  study  to  quantify  medical  disqualification 
events.  This  study  was  the  first  in  a  program  established  by  the  FAA,  to  examine 
and  monitor  denial  actions  periodically  to  identify  research  direction,  needed  modi-
fications to standards, and risk determination criteria. The primary purpose was the 
‘‘enhancement  of  flight  safety  through  medical  program  data  analysis.’’  In  the  first 
two program reports, the FAA reviewed the medical disqualification rates for all pi-
lots  (Booze,  1974;  Dark,  1980)  and  in  subsequent  years  (Dark,  1983;  Dark,  1984; 
Dark,  1986;  and  Downey  &  Dark,  1992)  they  focused  on  the  disqualification  rates 
for  airline  pilots.  In  every  report,  cardiovascular  disease  was  identified  as  the  most 
frequent  cause  of  disqualification;  in  the  most  recent  analysis  (Downey  &  Dark, 
1992) it accounted for 33.5 percent of the denials. It appears that the FAA’s medical 
protocols  have  reliably  eliminated  a  significant  cause  of  cognitive  decline  and  im-
pairment  in  the  ATP  population.  Additionally,  in  each  report,  the  rate  of  denial  in-
creased  with  age.  In  the  1992  analysis,  for  example,  the  age  specific  denial  rates 
per  1,000  pilots  were:  25–29  years—1.0;  30–34  years—1.0;  35–39  years—1.0;  40–44 
years—2.7;  45–49  years—5.6;  50–54  years—9.7;  and  55–59  years—16.2.1 These 
studies,  along  with  the  very  small  number  of  incapacitations  experienced  in  air 
transport  operations,  confirm  that  the  FAA’s  medical  certification  process  does  reli-
ably screen pilots who are at risk for impairment and incapacitation. 

It is ironic that the FAA’s preoccupation with cognitive decline and impaired per-
formance seems to be limited to aging pilots (and those who abuse alcohol or drugs) 
while  ignoring  fatigued  pilots.  A  robust  body  of  scientific  literature  clearly  estab-
lishes a relationship between fatigue and impairment. There is also ample evidence 
that  the  current  Federal  Aviation  Regulations  for  flight/duty  time  and  minimum 
rest  do  not  adequately  prevent  fatigue  in  air  carrier  operations.  The  FAA  last  ad-
dressed the fatigue issue with a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 1995. Ten years 
later,  we  still  wait  for  FAA  action;  there  has  been  no  disposition  of  comments,  no 
Final  Rule,  no  change.  In  the  meantime,  pilots  of  all  ages  continue  to  fly  fatigued, 
and possibly impaired, because of excessive duty periods and inadequate rest. 

Finally,  the  FAA’s  insistence  that  any  change  to  the  Age  60  Rule  maintain  an 
‘‘equivalent  level  of  safety’’  is  an  impossible  test  to  meet  because  the  point  of  ref-
erence is nonexistent. In this instance, the ‘‘equivalent level of safety’’ is a ruse. No-
where  in  the  scientific  literature,  or  in  any  FAA  report  or  document,  is  there  a 
measure  of  effect  that  can  be  directly  attributed  to  the  Age  60  Rule,  as  opposed  to, 
for  example,  improved  weather  forecasting,  improved  engines,  better  pilot  training, 
more reliable instrumentation, and so forth. There is no measure of effect—positive 
or  negative—that  the  Age  60  Rule  has  had  on  aviation  safety.  Absent  such  a  base-
line  measure,  how  can  one  demonstrate  that  a  proposed  change  to  the  Rule  would 
provide an equal or greater level of safety? 

The  Age  60  Rule  is  not  a  safety  rule.  Better  alternatives  exist  to  ensure  that  the 
active  ATP  population  remains  healthy  and  free  from  impairment  that  would  com-
promise air safety. The public would be better served if the FAA directed its limited 
resources  toward  enhancing  these  alternatives.  While  the  FAA  may  legitimately 
claim  that  it  followed  the  rulemaking  process  in  issuing  the  Age  60  Rule,  it  cannot 
claim  that  the  scientific  and  medical  evidence  conclusively  validates  the  Rule.  Nor 
has the FAA ever proved that the Rule’s implementation resulted in a safer aviation 
environment.  The  Aerospace  Medical  Association,  in  a  2004  position  paper  and  in 
2005 testimony before this Committee, argued that there is ‘‘insufficient medical evi-
dence  to  support  restriction  of  pilot  certification  based  on  age  alone.’’  It  is  time  to 
modify  the  Age  60  Rule.  S.  65  and  H.R.  65  together  are  an  appropriate  first  step 
in the right direction. 

1 We were able to obtain raw data from the FAA/CAMI on the number of applicants and deni-
als  for  first  class  medicals  for  2004.  Analysis  shows  the  same  trend  (i.e.,  increasing  number  of 
disqualifications with increasing age); however, because the raw data do not specifically identify 
air transport pilots, the information does not lend itself to direct comparison with the referenced 
FAA studies.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. GORDON H. SMITH TO 

CAPTAIN RALPH HUNTER 

Question  1.  If  a  pilot  can  meet  the  same  requirements  when  they  are  over  the 
age  of  60  that  they  met  when  they  were  in  their  30s,  40s,  or  50s,  why  should  he 
or she no longer be able to operate a commercial passenger aircraft? 

Answer.  The  current  medical  and  performance  standards  applied  to  30,  40,  and 
50-year old pilots do not provide an adequate test for the physical and cognitive de-
clines due to advancing age. The current testing regime was never designed for this 
task,  and  it  would  be  a  mistake  to  assume  that  it  was.  In  fact,  the  central  issue  of 
the entire Age 60 Rule debate is that the current state of medical and performance 
based testing does not provide a safe, reliable, and comprehensive method to screen 
for  the  effects  of  aging.  This  salient  fact  is  even  acknowledged  by  the  opponents  of 
the  Age  60  Rule  since  they  are  merely  requesting  to  extend—and  not  eliminate— 
the mandatory retirement rule. 

Requiring  an  individual  to  retire  from  a  chosen  profession  due  to  the  inevitable 
impact  of  aging  should  never  be  taken  lightly.  While  aviation  safety  considerations 
demand  some  method  of  mandatory  pilot  retirement,  science  and  technology  have 
not yet provided us with the proper tools to identify high risk pilots on an individual 
basis. Because of the absence of effective screening tools, virtually all of the partici-
pants in this discussion agree that some chronological age limit is necessary. 

The  opponents  of  the  current  regulation  cannot  point  to  any  existing  test  or 
screening  method  that  is  supported  by  objective  data,  and,  which  would  provide  a 
safe and effective replacement for the Age 60 Rule. By arbitrarily increasing the re-
tirement age in absence of such a method, Congress would be exposing the traveling 
public to an increased and unknown level of risk. Further research is warranted be-
fore making any significant change to this important regulation. 

Question  1a.  Would  you  support  additional  and  more  stringent  testing  and  train-
ing  for  pilots  60  years  of  age  that  would  indicate  whether  they  are  able  to  safely 
operate a commercial airliner? 

Answer.  The  Allied  Pilots  Association  strongly  supports  additional  research  into 
the  effects  of  aging  on  pilot  health  and  performance.  Both  the  FAA  and  the  Aero-
space  Medical  Association  (AsMA)  have  cited  the  critical  need  for  this  research  in 
their  testimony  to  the  Committee.  While  numerous  studies  of  pilots  have  unques-
tionably  shown  that  aging  inevitably  degrades  performance  and  increases  the  risk 
of  incapacitation,  no  one  has  yet  been  able  to  establish  measurable  criteria  or  reli-
able tests to identify when the level of risk reaches an unacceptable level. 

The supporters and proponents of the Age 60 Rule have highlighted a great philo-
sophical  divide  on  how  to  proceed  with  any  further  research  in  this  area.  The  sup-
porters  of  the  Age  60  Rule  advocate  the  time-tested  technique  of  establishing  safe 
practices  and  procedures  with  objective  data  prior  to  any  implementation  in  com-
mercial aviation. On the other hand, the opponents of the Age 60 Rule are, in effect, 
asking  Congress  to  conduct  an  experiment  on  the  traveling  public.  By  raising  the 
mandatory  retirement  age  first  and  collecting  data  later,  commercial  airline  pas-
sengers would be exposed to an unknown level of risk. This is no different than in-
troducing  a  new  aircraft,  engine,  or  system  into  commercial  airline  service  in  the 
absence  of  adequate  testing  based  upon  a  sincere  belief  that  safety  would  not  be 
compromised. This approach is simply not acceptable in aviation. 

If  further  research  on  aging  actually  produces  safe  and  reliable  medical  tests,  or 
performance  measurements  that  conclusively  screens  for  the  detrimental  effects  of 
aging, then APA would support its use in conjunction with a change to the manda-

tory  retirement  age.  However,  such  tests  do  not  currently  exist,  nor  are  they  pro-
jected to exist in the near future.

Question  2.  How  many  pilots  does  the  Age  60  Rule  affect  within  your  airline  or 

association each year? 

Answer.  Over  the  next  5  years,  approximately  1,950  pilots  (about  20  percent  of 

American’s active pilots) are expected to retire due to the Age 60 Rule. 

Question  2a.  Of  these  pilots  who  are  no  longer  allowed  to  fly  commercial  pas-

senger aircraft, are many interested in continuing as a pilot? 

Answer.  While  we  have  not  asked  this  specific  question  of  this  particular  group 
of  pilots,  it  is  important  to  point  out  that  every  commercial  pilot  was  aware  of  the 
Age  60  Rule  when  they  were  hired  at  their  airline.  I  would  also  strongly  caution 
against altering an important safety-related rule based upon individual preferences. 
Maintaining  or  increasing  the  current  level  of  aviation  safety  must  be  the  primary 
test by which any new regulation is judged. In fact, many of the current FAA regu-
lations  governing  pilot  qualifications,  responsibilities,  hours  on  duty,  and  rest  re-
quirements  exist  to  counter  the  very  real  personal  and  economic  pressures  to  oper-
ate aircraft in an unsafe manner. Safety concerns were the original basis of the Age 
60 Rule, and in the absence of compelling evidence for change, the Federal Govern-
ment’s  continuing  commitment  to  aviation  safety  demands  the  retention  of  this  im-
portant regulation. 

Question  3.  Do  many  pilots  continue  working  for  your  airline  (or  airline  you  rep-

resent) in a different position, or do most enter retirement? 

Answer.  Most  pilots  that  retire  due  to  the  Age  60  Rule  do  not  continue  employ-
ment  at  American  Airlines.  We  do  not  compile  data  on  pilot  activities  after  retire-
ment  from  American,  but  we  do  know  anecdotally  that  some  of  them  do  go  on  to 
other careers in and out of aviation.

CAPTAIN DUANE E. WOERTH 

Question  1.  If  a  pilot  can  meet  the  same  requirements  when  they  are  over  the 
age  of  60  that  they  met  when  they  were  in  their  30s,  40s,  or  50s,  why  should  he 
or she no longer be able to operate a commercial passenger aircraft? 

Answer. The current requirements, by definition, assume that an airline pilot will 
not  fly  past  age  60,  so  they  do  not  attempt  to  identify  many  of  the  physical  mani-
festations  of  the  aging  process,  whether  that  assessment  is  done  at  age  30  or  age 
59.  In  the  current  system,  there  is  no  testing  required  by  the  FAA,  at  any  age, 
which  would  serve  to  identify  cognitive  degradation  or  an  increased  likelihood  of 
age-related  debilitating  illness.  The  bottom  line  is  that  the  current  rule  has  proven 
to  be  safe  for  over  forty  years  and  there  is  no  medical  evidence,  nor  any  medical 
testing protocol, that would suggest that safety would be improved by changing the 
Rule. 

Question  1a.  Would  you  support  additional  and  more  stringent  testing  and  train-
ing  for  pilots  60  years  of  age  that  would  indicate  whether  they  are  able  to  safely 
operate a commercial airliner? 

Answer. As I stated in my testimony, ALPA did a comprehensive poll of our mem-
bers  and  specifically  addressed  this  issue.  Fewer  than  one-third  of  our  members 
would  support  any  sort  of  more  stringent  medical,  proficiency,  or  operational  re-
quirements for pilots over the age of 60. 

Question  2.  How  many  pilots  does  the  Age  60  Rule  affect  within  your  airline  or 

association each year? 

Answer.  The  best  data  we  have  is  a  comprehensive  study  of  Northwest  pilots  re-
tiring  since  1993.  I  believe  that  study  is  representative  of  most,  if  not  all,  U.S. 
ALPA carriers, and it shows that about 57 percent of retiring pilots are retiring be-
cause they have reached age 60. The other 43 percent retire for a variety of reasons, 
including medical retirement and elective early retirement. 

Question  2a.  Of  these  pilots  who  are  no  longer  allowed  to  fly  commercial  pas-
senger  aircraft,  are  many  interested  in  continuing  as  a  pilot?  Do  many  pilots  con-
tinue  working  for  your  airline  (or  airline  you  represent)  in  a  different  position,  or 
do most enter retirement? 

Answer. We don’t have specific data on what our members do after they leave ac-
tive  airline  pilot  service,  but  I  know  many  of  them  continue  in  aviation.  Some  fly 
for  corporate  or  FAR  Part  135  operators,  which,  incidentally,  is  a  category  of  oper-
ations that has an accident rate almost ten times higher than FAR Part 121 airline 
operations. Still others take non-flying positions at airlines.

change? 

Question  3.  What  were  their  main  reasons  for  their  opposition  to  a  possible  rule 

Answer.  Safety.  The  Age  60  Rule  recognizes  that  subtle  declines  in  cognitive  and 
neuropsychological functions occur during the aging process, and have a potentially 
adverse  impact  on  the  ability  of  pilots  to  perform  at  maximum  safety.  Moreover, 
medical  science  has  still  not  devised  a  reliable  testing  protocol  that  can  accurately 
screen pilots for possible exemption from this safety standard. Until such technology 
exists, the Age 60 Rule continues to prove both reasonable, and within an acceptable 
range  of  risk  for  commercial  air  transportation  operations.  Piloting  is  a  demanding 
profession, and one of the highest threats to aviation safety is fatigue. Sixteen-hour 
domestic duty days—even longer with more trans-Pacific international operations— 
are  facts  of  life  for  airline  pilots.  Irregular  shifts,  all-night  operations,  and  signifi-
cant circadian rhythm challenges all contribute to decreasing the margins of safety. 
After  what  ALPA  pilots  have  been  through  over  the  last  several  years—terrorism, 
bankruptcy,  furloughs,  pay  cuts,  pension  terminations,  and  work  rule  changes—a 
clear and sound majority still believe that safety considerations are entirely too im-
portant to set aside the Age 60 Rule. As stated at the hearing, this rule should only 
be  changed  if  it  can  be  guaranteed—beyond  all  reasonable  doubt—that  raising  the 
operational  age  limit  for  commercial  airline  pilots  will  not  jeopardize  safety  stand-
ards. 

Question 3a. Did pilots of all ages oppose the ruling equally? 
Answer. No. Age is a factor that greatly affects the position pilots take on the Age 
60  Rule.  Pilots  under  the  age  of  40  opposed  changing  the  Rule  by  nearly  a  three- 
to-one  margin  (74  percent  to  24  percent).  In  the  41  to  45  grouping,  31  percent  said 
‘‘yes’’  to  an  Age  60  Rule  change,  and  68  percent  said  ‘‘no.’’  Among  pilots  age  46   50, 
40  percent  said  ‘‘yes,’’  and  59  percent  said  ‘‘no’’  to  changing  the  Rule.  Additionally, 
had  the  nearly  6,000  furloughed  ALPA  pilots—most  of  whom  fall  in  these  age 
groups—been  included  in  the  polling,  support  for  maintaining  the  Age  60  Rule 
would have been even higher. 

From  this  point  on,  however,  the  percentages  reverse.  Among  pilots  aged  51  to 
55,  61  percent  indicated  they  want  a  rule  change,  while  37  percent  were  opposed. 
The  strongest  support  for  a  change  came  from  pilots  aged  56–60,  with  80  percent 
favoring a change and 19 percent opposed. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. GORDON H. SMITH TO 

CAPTAIN JOSEPH ‘‘IKE’’ EICHELKRAUT 

Question  1.  If  a  pilot  can  meet  the  same  requirements  when  they  are  over  the 
age  of  60  that  they  met  when  they  were  in  their  30s,  40s,  or  50s,  why  should  he 
or she no longer be able to operate a commercial passenger aircraft? 

Answer. Southwest Airlines and the Southwest Airlines Pilots’ Association strong-
ly support S. 65, which would end the Age 60 Rule, and allow pilots to retire when 
they are eligible for their full Social Security Benefits. The Aerospace Medical Asso-
ciation  and  the  International  Civil  Aviation  Authority  (ICAO)  have  both  said  that 
there is insufficient medical evidence to support an age-based rule. We believe that 
pilots should be able to work as long as they are able to pass an FAA Class 1 Med-
ical  exam,  and  meet  all  the  safety  criteria  and  standards  in  their  check  rides  and 
simulator tests. If an age restriction is put in place due to political reasons, we feel 
strongly  that,  at  a  minimum,  any  limit  should  allow  pilots  to  work  until  they  are 
eligible  for  full  Social  Security  and  Medicare  benefits.  This  is  especially  important 
in  the  current  environment  in  which  airlines  are  freezing,  limiting,  or  terminating 
the  defined  benefit  plans  that  were  promised  contractually  to  their  pilots.  It  is 
equally important for airlines, such as Southwest, offering defined contribution ben-
efits to their pilots so that they may maximize those benefits and their Social Secu-
rity contributions. 

Question 1a. Would you support additional, and more stringent testing, and train-
ing  for  pilots  60  years  of  age  that  would  indicate  whether  they  are  able  to  safely 
operate a commercial airliner? 

Answer.  The  FAA  has  safety  standards  that  are  the  envy  of  the  world.  ICAO,  in 
its  recent  report,  recommended  that  member  countries  adopt  a  maximum  age  re-
striction of 65 (up from 60) in multi-crew operations, and essentially suggested that 
the world adopt the FAA standard as the suggested regime of medical and cognitive 
testing.  We  know  that  the  checks  and  balances  now  in  the  FAA  system  are  self- 
purging  and  believe  they  are  a  sufficient  test  of  any  pilot’s  capabilities.  The  Class 
1  medical  exam,  which  must  be  passed  every  6  months,  and  the  annual  EKG  test, 
is  a  sufficient  medical  screen  to  detect  health  concerns  that  may  arise  and  create 
issues in the cockpit. Furthermore, the semi-annual simulator check rides and ran-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:28 Jan 14, 2011 Jkt 063516 PO 00000 Frm 00063 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\63516.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

dom in-flight check rides, by check airmen, are an excellent screen of piloting skills 
and cognitive ability at any age. 

60 

Question  2.  How  many  pilots  does  the  Age  60  Rule  affect  within  your  airline  or 

association each year? 

Answer. Southwest, being a relatively new airline has not had to deal with many 
retirements  until  just  recently.  In  the  past  5  years,  SWA  has  experienced  only  a 
combined  total  of  281  pilot  retirements,  of  which,  86  percent  stayed  beyond  their 
59th  birthday.  We  currently  have  129  active  members  aged  59  or  older,  and  this 
will raise the percentage next year to over 92 percent. 

Question  2a.  Of  these  pilots  who  are  no  longer  allowed  to  fly  commercial  pas-
senger  aircraft,  are  many  interested  in  continuing  as  a  pilot?  Do  many  pilots  con-
tinue  working  for  your  airline  (or  airline  you  represent)  in  a  different  position,  or 
do most enter retirement? 

Answer.  Most  pilots  at  SWA  who  are  forced  into  retirement  at  60  would  prefer 
to  stay,  whether  for  personal  or  financial  reasons,  e.g.—a  defined  contribution  re-
tirement  plan  which  grows  both  with  investments  and  with  added  (401k)  contribu-
tions. Although we do not track the employment activities of retirees, we know that 
most  go  on  to  take  jobs  in  other  parts  of  aviation,  whether  it  is  flying  for  overseas 
carriers  that  don’t  have  the  restrictive  FAA  Age  60  rule,  or  in  other  parts  of  com-
mercial aviation that do not require early retirement. There are only 2 management 
jobs  per  year,  on  average,  available  to  Southwest  pilots  over  60,  so  this  does  not 
represent a substantial employment opportunity for pilots over 60 at our airline.

CAPTAIN AL SPAIN 

Question  1.  If  a  pilot  can  meet  the  same  requirements  when  they  are  over  the 
age  of  60  that  they  met  when  they  were  in  their  30s,  40s,  or  50s,  why  should  he 
or she no longer be able to operate a commercial passenger aircraft? 

Answer. JetBlue believes that all pilots should be judged on their individual abil-
ity and thus, if at age 60 or 61, just as at age 40 or 50, a pilot is judged competent 
to fly and medically able to fly, he or she should not be prohibited by law from such 
flying. The tools are already in place to ensure appropriate standards of safety. med-
ical testing and flight performance for all pilots, regardless of age. 

Question 1a. Would you support additional and more stringent testing, and train-
ing  for  pilots  60  years  of  age  that  would  indicate  whether  they  are  able  to  safely 
operate a commercial airliner? 

Answer.  Consistent  with  the  answer  above,  current  requirements  for  Recurrent 
Ground  School,  twice-yearly  simulator  training  and  check  rides,  and  annual  line 
checks prove the pilots flying and cognitive abilities for the specific aircraft and op-
eration. Maintaining a Class I FAA Flight Physical requires a complete physical two 
times per year along with an annual EKG. 

Question  2.  How  many  pilots  does  the  Age  60  Rule  affect  within  your  airline  or 

association each year? 

Answer. It would vary considerably from year to year, and depends on future hir-
ing trends. However in the near future we would not see more than five (5) to eight 
(8) pilots per year leaving the cockpit due to the Age 60 Rule. 

Question  2a.  Of  these  pilots  who  are  no  longer  allowed  to  fly  commercial  pas-
senger  aircraft,  are  many  interested  in  continuing  as  a  pilot?  Do  many  pilots  con-
tinue  working  for  your  airline  (or  airline  you  represent)  in  a  different  position,  or 
do most enter retirement? 

Answer. At JetBlue, all pilots impacted by the Age 60 Rule, thus far, have desired 
to keep flying. In fact, each of the pilots continues to work at JetBlue and most still 
do fly tech ops, ferry, or other flights that do not carry revenue passengers, though 
many of the flights do carry non-revenue passengers. Additionally, many pilots who 
are  approaching  age  60  are  currently  actively  searching  for  jobs.  Ironically,  if  the 
retirement  rule  is  not  changed,  these  pilots  will  most  likely  be  flying  passengers  in 
business jets, or even business versions of commercial airliners, within the U.S. air-
space  system,  and  consistent  with  the  rules  of  the  same  FAA  that  bars  their  flying 
commercial airlines.

ATA HOLDINGS CORP. 

Indianapolis, IN, July 19, 2005 

Hon. CONRAD BURNS, 
Chairman, 
Senate Subcommittee on Aviation, 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, 
Washington, DC. 
Dear Chairman Burns: 

I  am  writing  this  on  behalf  of  the  pilots  of  ATA  Airlines,  Inc.  (ATA);  a  company 

I founded thirty-two years ago . . . and was the first pilot. 

Our  pilots  recently  voted  to  oppose  the  mandatory  Age  60  retirement  law;  both 
in  Congress  and  through  their  union.  They  have  my  unconditional  support  on  this 
issue.  The  Age  60  Law  was,  is  and  will  forever  be,  capricious  and  arbitrary.  From 
the executive level of airline management, as well as from the cockpit, I know there 
is no medical issue justifying it; there never has been. 

This  law,  14  CFR  121.383(c),  is  simply  age  discrimination.  It  can  he  defined  in 

other terms. 

You  will  have  before  you  H.R.  65.  sponsored  by  the  Honorable  Jim  Gibbons,  and 
co-sponsored  by  an  impressive  list  of  bipartisan  supporters.  H.R.  65  will  move  the 
mandatory  retirement  age  for  airline  pilots  back  to  65.  This  is  still  discriminatory, 
but is at least a first step toward eliminating the age factor entirely, and ultimately 
judging individual pilots on their ability and performance. 

Please support the passage of H.R. 65, its Senate counterpart, S. 65 and any proc-
ess  that  will  eliminate  this  arcane  rule  with  the  full  weight  of  your  most  esteemed 
office. 

Sincerely, 

Chairman, President/Chief Executive Officer.
