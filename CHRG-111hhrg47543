HEARING CHARTER

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Electronic Waste: Investing in
Research and Innovation to
Reuse, Reduce, and Recycle

WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2009

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On  February  11,  2009,  the  Science  and  Technology  Committee  will  receive  testi-
mony on draft legislation entitled ‘‘The Electronic Waste Research and Development
Act of 2009.’’ Witnesses will provide their comments on, and suggestions to, the bill.
They will also discuss ways in which research and development (R&D) can help ad-
dress  the  challenge  of  managing  the  disposal  of  electronics  products  in  the  United
States.  Five  witnesses,  representing  perspectives  from  academia,  a  non-profit,  elec-
tronics producers, and electronics recyclers, will offer testimony.
Witnesses

• Dr.  Valerie  Thomas,  Anderson  Interface  Associate  Professor,  Georgia  Insti-
tute of Technology. Dr. Thomas will discuss her research on innovative meth-
ods  to  manage  electronic  waste  and  the  challenges  facing  the  recycling  and
re-use of electronic products.

• Dr.  Paul  Anastas,  Teresa  and  H.  John  Heinz  III  Professor  in  the  Practice
of Chemistry for the Environment and Director of the Center for Green Chem-
istry and Green Engineering, Yale University. Dr. Anastas will discuss the ap-
plicability  of  research  in  green  chemistry  and  engineering  to  the  electronics
sector.

• Mr.  Philip  Bond,  President,  Technology  Association  of  America.  Mr.  Bond
will  discuss  ways  in  which  innovation  through  R&D  could  help  electronics
manufacturers address the challenge of electronic waste. He will also give his
views  on  promoting  collaboration  between  industry  and  non-industry  re-
searchers to encourage the transfer of successful research into products.

• Mr. Jeff Omelchuck, Executive Director, Green Electronic Council and Elec-
tronic  Product  Environmental  Assessment  Tool  (EPEAT).  Mr.  Omelchuck  will
discuss the development and utility of EPEAT, challenges to making existing
electronics  products  more  environmentally  friendly,  and  ways  in  which  R&D
could address these challenges.

• Mr.  Willie  Cade,  Chief  Executive  Officer,  PC  Rebuilders  and  Recyclers.  Mr.
Cade  will  describe  the  challenges  faced  by  electronics  refurbishers  and  recy-
clers,  and  discuss  ways  to  promote  collaboration  between  academic  research-
ers and the recycling and refurbishing businesses.

Issues and Concerns

• Electronic waste, or e-waste, the term used to describe used televisions, com-
puters,  cell  phones,  monitors,  etc.,  that  are  ready  for  discard,  is  a  growing
problem  in  the  U.S.  and  worldwide.  The  Environmental  Protection  Agency
(EPA)  estimated  that  between  1980  and  2004,  two  billion  electronic  products
were sold in the U.S. Of these they estimated just over half were still in use,
while  42  percent  had  been  disposed  of  and  nine  percent  were  in  storage.  Of
the  amount  disposed  of,  only  11  percent  reached  recyclers.  The  rest  went  to

landfills.1 Electronics  are  bulky  and  contain  hazardous  materials  that  pose
concerns  for  disposal  in  landfills.  Due  to  the  involvement  of  State  and  local
governments, environmental groups, and electronics producers, more of these
products are being recycled. However, as described below, there are still many
hurdles  to  cost-effective,  nationwide  electronics  recycling.  Additionally,  the
biggest  environmental  footprint  for  electronics  arises  out  of  their  production.
Enabling consumers to use (or re-use) these products longer could reduce the
impact of this production on the environment. The draft legislation discussed
at  this  hearing  will  address  some  of  the  challenges  to  increase  recycling  and
re-use through R&D and education.
• While e-waste recycling is increasing in the U.S., the industry faces a number
of  challenges.  These  challenges  include  convincing  consumers  to  recycle,  the
logistics of collecting e-waste, efficiently disassembling products, safely remov-
ing  hazardous  substances,  efficiently  processing  materials,  and  recovering
value from many of the e-waste constituent materials. For instance, the more
commingled  a  stream  of  plastics  becomes  as  casings  and  components  from
products are mixed together in processing, the less value it has for re-use. Im-
proving the technologies that sort these plastics, or developing new processes
and materials that can use non-homogeneous plastics will make e-waste recy-
cling less costly and will reduce waste material. From research on influencing
consumer  behavior  to  automated  methods  of  sending  information  to  recyclers
about  the  products  moving  through  their  plants,  R&D  could  help  make  recy-
cling more efficient and cheaper.
• The design of electronic products could also aid in making recycling more cost
efficient.  Many  products  are  difficult  to  disassemble  and  the  location  of  haz-
ardous  materials  varies  (i.e.,  mercury  lamps  in  some  flat  panel  displays).
Product  design  for  recycling  would  look  at  the  needs  of  end-of-life  manage-
ment.  Greater  use  of  materials  recycled  from  old  electronics  is  another  up-
front design choice that would help make recycling more profitable. Research-
ers could examine the feasibility of different design schemes and recycled ma-
terials  usage  to  help  electronic  product  development  become  more  of  a  closed
loop process.
• Scores  of  different  chemicals  and  materials  comprise  computers,  televisions,
cell  phones  and  other  electronics.  Some  of  the  substances  used  in  electronics
(e.g.,  lead  and  hexavalent  chromium)  have  raised  enough  concern  that  the
European  Union  adopted  a  measure  to  ban  their  use  in  electronics  products
sold in Europe.2 Manufacturers have been able to comply with these require-
ments  for  most  consumer  electronics,  but  the  process  to  ban  substances  sen-
sitive  to  the  environment  and  human  health  is  on-going.  For  example,  the
risk  to  human  health  posed  by  certain  types  of  brominated  flame  retardants
used  in  electronics  and  other  products  has  created  a  controversy  over  their
continued use. Comprehensive data on the properties of substitutes for harm-
ful  materials  would  enable  electronics  designers  to  change  their  products
more quickly in response to concerns raised by different materials. The avail-
ability of this type of comprehensive data, provided by the National Institutes
of  Standards  and  Technology,  enabled  manufacturers  to  quickly  meet  the
challenge  of  eliminating  ozone-layer  depleting  chlorofluorocarbons  (CFCs)
from their products in the 1980’s.
• Increasing the amount of electronics headed to responsible recyclers is essen-
tial  to  reducing  the  impacts  of  e-waste.  Also  essential  though  is  research  to
increase  and  encourage  the  re-use  of  electronic  products.  Estimates  of  the
total amount of energy required over a computer’s life cycle show that roughly
80  percent  goes  into  the  computer’s  production  phase,  and  only  20  percent
into  the  use  phase.3 Extending  the  amount  of  time  a  product  is  in  use  could
not  only  reduce  the  volume  of  e-waste,  but  also  lessen  the  impact  of  the  pro-
duction  of  these  complex  and  sophisticated  products  on  the  environment.
Often  consumers  buy  new  cell  phones,  laptops,  or  other  devices  because  they
want the functionality or ‘look’ of a new model, not because their current de-
vice  is  broken.  Consumers  are  often  wary  of  purchasing  used  electronics  be-
cause they are unsure of a used product’s value or they are afraid it will not
meet  their  needs.  Developing  re-use  markets  that  aid  consumers  in  evalu-

ating  used  devices  could  help  keep  these  devices  in  the  hands  of  consumers
for  a  longer  period  of  time.  Prolonging  a  device’s  use  could  also  be  accom-
plished  by  developing  ways  for  consumers  to  easily  upgrade  their  current
products.
• Improving  the  training  of  students  equips  the  future  workforce  to  design
products  with  a  minimal  environmental  impact.  Continuing  education  of  the
existing workforce in the electronics and recycling industries informs these in-
dividuals of best-practices in their fields. Similarly, collaboration between aca-
demic  researchers  and  those  in  industry  can  help  transfer  solutions  to  the
problems identified above as fast as possible.

Background
Regulations

No  federal  law  or  national  framework  exists  to  handle  the  growing  volume  of  e-
waste  generated  by  U.S.  consumers.  At  least  since  2000,  with  the  convening  of  the
National  Electronics  Stewardship  Initiative,  electronics  producers  and  other  stake-
holders have been aware of the e-waste problem. However, because of competing in-
terests  over  financing  mechanisms,  electronics  producers,  environmental  groups,
and  consumer  representatives  have  not  been  able  to  reach  a  consensus  on  how  a
national  e-waste  program  should  be  implemented.  In  the  absence  of  federal  regula-
tions,  some  states  and  localities  have  instituted  mandatory  e-waste  recycling.  Cali-
fornia  implemented  a  program  in  2005.  Maine,  Washington,  and  Minnesota  imple-
mented  e-waste  programs  in  2007.  Other  states,  like  Oregon,  are  slated  to  begin
their  programs  this  year.  Each  State  program  is  slightly  different,  creating  a  chal-
lenge  for  electronics  companies  that  now  must  finance  the  take-back  and  recycling
of  products  in  all  states  with  programs  (except  California,  where  consumers  pay  a
fee for recycling at the time of purchase). In addition, many of these companies have
extended this take-back service to consumers in states without specific e-waste pro-
grams, though the service is not always free of charge.

The European Union has been ahead of the U.S. in dealing with e-waste, passing
the  Waste  Electrical  and  Electronic  Equipment  Directive  (WEEE)  in  2000,  which
banned  disposal  of  e-waste  in  landfills  and  required  producers  to  take-back  their
used  products.  The  actual  implementation  of  this  directive  has  varied  country  by
country. In Europe, just as in the U.S., the cost of recycling is also a challenge.

Export

Another  significant  problem  is  the  export  of  e-waste  from  the  developed  world  to
China and other developing nations, where low-paid workers pull apart the products
to  extract  any  valuable  materials.  Using  crude  methods,  these  workers  are  exposed
to toxic substances, carrying a heavy burden on human health and the surrounding
environment.  While  some  exported  electronics  can  be  legitimately  refurbished  and
re-used,  an  overwhelming  quantity  has  no  re-use  value  and  is  improperly  and
unsafely  recycled  or  discarded.  According  to  the  Basel  Action  Network  (BAN),  ap-
proximately  80  percent  of  the  e-waste  directed  to  recycling  in  the  U.S.  is  not  recy-
cled, but is instead exported. Much of this export is not illegal, though the EPA re-
quires  that  any  exporter  of  the  leaded-glass  cathode  ray  tubes  (CRT)  from  old  tele-
vision certify that all CRT exports are going to legitimate processors overseas. This
rule is frequently ignored and only minimally enforced. Both BAN and the Institute
of  Scrap  Recycling  Industries  are  working  on  separate  standards  that  would  pro-
mote  accountability  within  the  electronics  recycling  community.  These  standards
will be available sometime this year.

Federal Activity

When  safely  handled,  e-waste  can  be  a  valuable  source  of  commodities  like  gold
and  silver.  These  items  are  more  enriched  in  these  precious  metals  than  a  com-
parable  weight  of  naturally  occurring  ore.4 To  encourage  recycling,  the  Environ-
mental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  offers  facts  on  e-waste  and  information  to  con-
sumers about where they can find recyclers in their area on their website. EPA also
has  the  ‘‘Plug  Into  eCycling  Program’’  which  is  a  partnership  between  EPA,  manu-
facturers,  and  retailers  to  offer  consumers  more  opportunities  to  recycle  or  donate
their old electronics. An example of an initiative under the program is the campaign
‘‘Recycle  your  cell  phone.  It’s  an  easy  call.’’  This  is  a  national  campaign  supported
by  major  manufacturers,  carriers,  and  retailers  to  educate  consumers  about  cell

phone  recycling.  The  EPA  has  also  supported  a  Design  for  the  Environment  Pro-
gram and Electronics Products Assessment Tool (EPEAT).

EPEAT

EPEAT  receives  EPA  funding,  and  is  a  product  of  the  not-for-profit  Green  Elec-
tronics  Council.  EPEAT  is  an  assessment  tool  that  compares  the  environmental  at-
tributes  of  different  brands  and  models  of  desktop  and  laptop  computers.  Many
large  institutional  buyers,  including  sectors  of  the  Federal  Government,  will  only
buy  equipment  that  is  ranked  highly  by  EPEAT.  EPEAT  convenes  manufactures,
environmental representatives, and other stakeholders to establish performance cri-
teria  the  products  must  meet  to  attain  rankings  of  bronze,  silver,  or  gold.  Products
are rated in such categories as to the amount of environmentally sensitive material
they contain, ease of disassembly for recycling, and energy conservation.

Opportunities for R&D and Education

As  identified  above,  by  supporting  R&D  and  education,  the  proposed  legislation
can help reduce the impact of electronics products on the environment through recy-
cling and re-use.

Chair  GORDON.  This  hearing  will  come  to  order.  Good  morning
and welcome to today’s hearing on electronic waste. I would like to
extend  a  special  thanks  to  our  witnesses,  and  today  we  will  con-
sider  a  draft  legislation  to  establish  programs  to  address  the  chal-
lenge of e-waste.

Last April, the Committee held its first hearing on this topic. We
explored  the  challenges  of  managing  the  discarded  old  computers,
cell phones, TVs, and other electronic products. These obsolete and
inoperable  products  are  being  discarded  to  become  what  we  com-
monly refer to as e-waste, or electronic waste.

As  consumers  move  on  to  flat-screen  displays  and  the  latest
smart phones, older products are likely to be discarded by the mil-
lions.  However,  as  I  am  sure  we  will  learn  today,  these  old  prod-
ucts still have value. They either are still functional or they contain
valuable  materials.  So  perhaps  terming  these  sophisticated  prod-
ucts as ‘‘waste’’ is a bit of a misnomer.

However,  only  a  small  percentage  of  these  products  make  it  to
the e-waste recyclers. Most of us put our old electronics out on the
curb or store them in a closet or dresser drawer. Perhaps the most
egregious practice is the export of e-waste to workers in the devel-
oping world. There the valuable commodities are stripped from the
products  and  processed  using  primitive  methods.  These  practices
endanger people’s health and pollute the areas where they live.

This bill represents what I hope will be the first step at the fed-
eral  level  in  addressing  this  growing  crisis.  As  the  Committee
learned  last  April,  over  a  dozen  states,  local  governments,  and
many  companies  have  begun  to  increase  e-waste  recycling,  and
through the international laws and regulations, companies have re-
moved lead, mercury and other toxic materials from their electronic
products.

But  the  Committee  also  learned  that  these  efforts  are  not  with-
out their challenges and much could be done better if we knew how
to  do  it.  The  bill  we  are  discussing  today  provides  support  for  aca-
demic  researchers  to  start  tackling  some  of  the  barriers  to  making
electronics greener.

The  recycling  of  plastics  from  electronics  is  a  good  example  of
where  this  type  of  research  could  make  a  difference.  Current  tech-
nology  to  sort  plastics  coming  into  the  recycling  plants  cannot  dif-
ferentiate  between  all  types  of  plastics.  Plastic  streams  end  up
mixed and the reprocessing plastics can no longer be used in high-
value  applications.  This  is  a  problem  that  can  be  attacked  from
both sides.

Technology  to  sort  plastics  can  be  improved  and  research  can  be
done  to  figure  out  how  to  make  mixed  recycled  plastics  more  suit-
able  for  use  in  new  products.  Creating  more  demand  for  recycled
materials  will  make  recycling  more  profitable  and  create  less
waste.

This  bill  provides  a  mechanism  for  bringing  together  academic
researchers  and  the  industry  partners.  It  is  important  that  we  are
able  to  implement  the  new  technologies  to  reduce  waste  and  to
manufacture products with environmentally friendly materials.

And  finally,  the  bill  before  us  today  addresses  the  need  to  edu-
cate  both  future  and  current  workers.  We  need  to  get  engineers
thinking about green design of products and recycling. This should

become central to the way we approach their jobs. To that end, the
bill  creates  curriculum  development  and  professional  development
opportunities.

With  that,  I  look  forward  to  the  testimony  we  are  going  to  re-
ceive  today,  and  I  now  recognize  our  distinguished  Ranking  Mem-
ber, my friend from Texas, Mr. Hall.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIR GORDON

Good  morning  and  welcome  to  today’s  hearing  on  Electronic  Waste.  I  would  like
to extend a special thank you to our witnesses. Today we will consider draft legisla-
tion to establish programs to address the challenge of e-waste.

Last  April,  the  Committee  held  its  first  hearing  on  this  topic.  We  explored  the
challenges  of  managing  the  discarded  old  computers,  cell  phones,  TVs,  and  other
electronic  products.  These  obsolete  and  inoperable  products  are  being  discarded  to
become what we now commonly refer to as e-waste.

As  consumers  move  on  to  flat  screen  displays  and  the  latest  smart  phones,  older
products  are  likely  to  be  discarded  by  the  millions.  However,  as  I’m  sure  we  will
learn  today,  these  old  products  still  have  value.  They  either  are  still  functional  or
they  contain  valuable  materials.  So  perhaps  terming  these  sophisticated  products
‘‘waste’’ is a bit of a misnomer.

However,  only  a  small  percentage  of  these  products  make  it  to  e-waste  recyclers.
Most of us put our old electronics out on the curb or store them in a closet or desk
drawer.  Perhaps  the  most  egregious  practice  is  the  export  of  e-waste  to  workers  in
the  developing  world.  There,  the  valuable  commodities  are  stripped  from  the  prod-
ucts  and  processed  using  primitive  methods.  These  practices  endanger  people’s
health and pollute the areas where they live.

This bill represents what I hope will be a first step at the federal level in address-
ing  the  growing  crisis.  As  the  Committee  learned  last  April,  over  a  dozen  states,
local  governments,  and  many  companies  have  begun  to  increase  e-waste  recycling.
And  through  international  laws  and  regulations,  companies  have  removed  lead,
mercury, and other toxic materials from their electronic products.

But  the  Committee  also  learned  that  these  efforts  are  not  without  their  chal-
lenges, and much could be done better if we knew how to do it. The bill we are dis-
cussing  today  provides  support  for  academic  researchers  to  start  tackling  some  of
the barriers to making electronics greener.

The  recycling  of  plastics  from  electronics  is  a  good  example  of  where  this  type  of
research could make a difference. Current technology to sort plastics coming into re-
cycling plants cannot differentiate between all types of plastics. Plastic streams end
up mixed and the re-processed plastics can no longer be used in high-value applica-
tions. This is a problem that can be attacked from both sides.

Technology  to  sort  plastics  can  be  improved  and  research  can  be  done  to  figure
out how to make mixed recycled plastics more suitable for use in new products. Cre-
ating  more  demand  for  recycled  materials  will  make  recycling  more  profitable  and
create less waste.

This  bill  provides  a  mechanism  for  bringing  together  academic  researchers  and
the  industry  partners.  It  is  important  that  we  are  able  to  implement  the  new  tech-
nologies  to  reduce  waste  and  manufacture  products  with  environmentally  friendly
materials.

and current workers. We need to get engineers thinking about green design of prod-
ucts and recycling. This should become central to the way they approach their jobs.
To  that  end,  the  bill  creates  curriculum  development  and  professional  development
opportunities.

With  that,  I  look  forward  to  the  testimony  we  are  going  to  receive  today.  I  now
recognize  our  distinguished  Ranking  Member  and  my  good  friend  from  Texas,  Mr.
Hall.

Mr. HALL. I thank you, Mr. Chair. I am very pleased that we are
having  this  very  interesting  hearing  today.  Sixty-three  years  ago
this  week,  the  United  States  Army  unveiled  the  world’s  first  gen-
eral  purpose  electronic  computer.  I  remember  it  well.  This  Elec-
tronic  Numerical  Integrator  And  Computer,  or  ENIAC,  was  de-
signed to be capable of solving a full range of computing problems.

ENIAC  took  up  to  680  square  feet  of  space,  weighed  30  tons  and
consumed  10  kilowatts  of  power.  We  have  obviously  come  a  long
way  since  February  14,  1946.  As  electronic  products  have  become
faster  and  more  reliable,  they  have  also  become  more  significantly
smaller and more disposable. I just think that today’s level of com-
putational ability is hardly used by most people and yet still highly
sought  after  in  the  marketplace.  Advances  in  flat-screen  tech-
nologies have led to a new generation of televisions. With each new
technological  advance  and  model  replacement,  we  face  an  inevi-
table problem of electronic waste, or e-waste.

There are a lot of aspects to the e-waste dilemma—the definition
of  e-waste,  reuse  and  recycling  of  electronics,  landfill  disposal  and
hazardous waste, regulatory issues and export economies. The EPA
has  already  instituted  several  programs  to  deal  with  these  prob-
lems.  They  include  EPA’s  Product  Stewardship,  which  supports
stake  holder  dialogues,  pilot  programs,  public  education  and  inter-
national cooperation to foster coordination of electronics use and re-
cycling,  EPA’s  Design  for  the  Environment  Program,  which  works
with  electronics  manufacturers  to  incorporate  environmental  con-
siderations  into  product  design,  also,  EPA’s  Environmentally  Pref-
erable Purchasing Program, which helps federal agencies purchase
environmentally  preferable  products,  the  Energy  Star  Program,
which  promotes  energy-efficiency  products  through  a  labeling  cam-
paign,  and  EPA’s  WasteWise  Program,  which  challenges  its  part-
ners to set goals for reducing e-waste.

I  am  grateful  to  the  Chair  for  circulating  the  discussion  draft
that  we  have  before  us  today  and  bringing  this  topic  to  the  fore-
front. I am curious to see how some provisions in the draft fit with
existing programs already at EPA. Clearly, none of us want to du-
plicate  efforts  already  underway  as  we  try  to  effectively  and  effi-
ciently deal with this challenge.

I am intrigued with a number of aspects of this bill. I am hoping
to  get  some  clarification  and  hear  our  panelists’  thoughts  on  the
‘‘Green  Alternative  Materials  Physical  Property  Database.’’  Would
this  database  replicate  the  structure  and  functions  of  the  OSHA/
EPA Occupational Chemical Database or would it resemble the pol-
lution prevention—what is that noise I hear?

Chair GORDON. Electronic waste.
Mr. HALL. Or would it—I thought you were fixing to get the hook
after  me.  Or  would  it  resemble  the  Pollution  Prevention  Resource
Exchange? They write these things and I read them, Mr. Chair.

I  am  hoping  that  the  highly  qualified  panel  we  have  here  this
morning will be able to shed some light on some of the gaps in elec-
tronic waste research, and if the discussion draft appropriately ad-
dresses  these  shortcomings,  it  would  be  good  to  know.  I  look  for-
ward  to  hearing  from  our  witnesses  today  about  this  important
issue, and I yield back my time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RALPH M. HALL

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased we are having this hearing today. Sixty-
three  years  ago  this  week,  the  United  States  Army  unveiled  the  world’s  first  gen-
eral-purpose  electronic  computer.  The  Electronic  Numerical  Integrator  and  Com-

consumed  150  kilowatts  of  power.  We  have  obviously  come  a  long  way  since  Feb-
ruary  14,  1946.  As  electronic  products  have  become  faster  and  more  reliable,  they
have also become significantly smaller and more disposable.

Blackberry  devices,  iPods,  cell  phones  and  other  small  electronics  are  rapidly  re-
placed  by  newer  models  with  more  gadgets.  Computers  and  laptops  provide  a  level
of  computational  ability  that  is  hardly  used  by  most  people,  yet  still  highly  sought
after  in  the  marketplace.  Advances  in  flat-screen  technologies  have  led  to  a  new

ducing e-waste.

I am grateful to the Chairman for circulating the discussion draft we have before
us today and bringing this topic to the forefront. I am curious to see how some pro-
visions  in  the  draft  fit  with  existing  programs  already  at  EPA.  Clearly,  none  of  us
wants  to  duplicate  efforts  already  underway  as  we  try  to  effectively  and  efficiently
deal with this challenge.

I am intrigued with a number of aspects of this bill. I am hoping to get some clari-
fication and hear our panelists’ thoughts on a ‘‘Green Alternative Materials Physical
Property  Database.’’  Would  this  database  replicate  the  structure  and  functions  of
the  OSHA/EPA  Occupational  Chemical  Database?  Or,  would  it  resemble  the  Pollu-
tion  Prevention  Resource  Exchange,  a  clearinghouse  that  brings  together  informa-
tion  from  a  consortium  of  regional  pollution  prevention  information  centers  funded
by the EPA?

I  am  hoping  that  the  highly  qualified  panel  we  have  this  morning  will  be  able
to  shed  some  light  on  some  of  the  gaps  in  electronic  waste  research  and  if  the  dis-
cussion draft appropriately addresses these shortcomings. I look forward to hearing
from our witnesses today about this important issue. I yield back the balance of my
time.

Chair  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Hall,  and  your  staff  wrote  some

very good information there. We want to follow up on that.

Additional  Members  may  submit  statements  that  they  have  at
this  time,  including  records  at  this  point,  and  I  will  submit  one
from  my  friend,  the  Congressman  from  the  1st  District  of  Cali-
fornia, Mike Thompson, who has been very active in this issue. He
has a written statement that we will include. [See Appendix 2: Ad-
ditional Material for the Record.]

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Thank you, Chairman Gordon, for convening this hearing on a public policy issue

that as of yet, has remained mostly unaddressed.

E-waste  is  a  somewhat  new  term  to  our  lexicon,  but  it  is  evident  that  it  is  one
that we will increasingly hear near future. As consumers buy new cell phones, com-
puters,  iPods  and  other  electronic  devices  with  increasing  frequency,  we  must  ad-
dress  the  issue  of  what  to  do  with  these  discarded  items,  some  of  which  contain
harmful and ever-lasting materials.

Some  states  have  already  taken  steps  to  regulate  and  promote  the  recycling  and
re-use  of  e-waste  and  I  believe  it  is  time  for  the  Federal  Government  to  evaluate

its  role  in  this  issue  as  well.  We  need  to  ensure  that  an  e-waste  policy  is  stream-
lined so that participation can extend across industries and products.

While it’s true that new technologies are reducing the relative sizes of electronics
and appliances, the problem of e-waste is one to which relatively little research has
been  devoted.  Manufacturers,  when  economically  and  technologically  feasible,
should phase out products that are proving to be particularly durable and potential
health  hazards.  It’s  clear  that  a  national  framework  to  address  these  concerns  is
needed.

In the tradition of the Science and Technology Committee, we have sought to ad-
dress an issue on the forefront of the technology discussion. I look forward to hear-
ing testimony today and thank you, Mr. Chairman for my time.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Good morning, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member.
It really is stunning to know that the United States exports 80 percent of its elec-

tronic waste to other countries.

It  is  shameful  that  much  of  that  waste  goes  to  developing  countries  like  China,
where workers disassemble televisions and computers, often at great hazard to their
health. The waste then goes into landfills in those countries, putting vulnerable peo-
ple at risk for toxic ground and water pollution.

The  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  has  held  hearings  in  previous  years
on  this  issue,  and  I  want  to  thank  the  Chairman  and  Ranking  Member  for  their
work to help inform Members.

Now, we have legislation with the intention to begin to address this problem. Sec-

tion 4 of the bill will be particularly helpful.

This section provides for a competitive grants program fostering collaborations be-
tween  institutes  of  higher  education,  non-profit  research  institutions,  government
laboratories,  and  for-profit  entities  (i.e.,  manufacturers,  designers,  refurbishers,  or
recyclers).

Grant  money  will  help  fund  ways  to  manage  electronic  waste  through  reduction,

reuse, and recycling.

Protection Agency.

Mr. Chairman, I am in strong support of this program within the Environmental

Although the Agency is making some efforts to encourage and educate consumers
about proper disposal of electronic waste, those efforts do not go nearly far enough.
What  we  need  is  for  technology  manufacturers  to  make  computer  parts,  digital
music players, televisions, mobile phones, photocopiers and other equipment that is
more environmentally sustainable.

If the Longworth Cafeteria can serve cups and plates that are made of biodegrad-
able  material,  then  the  high-tech  industry  can  make  products  that  won’t  end  up  in
landfills or harm workers who are trying to recycle them.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  also  appreciate  Section  6  of  the  bill.  This  section  will  establish
a competitive grant program for institutions of higher education to improve teaching
methods regarding ‘‘green engineering.’’

Stimulating  our  education  system  to  prepare  experts  who  can  tackle  these  prob-

lems will be a key component for success.

Although the bill does specify community colleges as target recipients of the grant

funding, I don’t see provisions encouraging minority-serving institutions to apply.

This  committee  may  expect  future  interest  from  me  in  amending  the  legislation
to  encourage  applicants  from  minority-serving  institutions.  These  colleges  and  uni-
versities receive less research grant money and have traditionally struggled to com-
pete with the larger universities. It is my intention to provide them with opportuni-
ties to increase research and graduate-level training.

Mr. Chairman, I thank you again for holding today’s hearing, and I wish the wit-

nesses a warm welcome.

I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  hosting  this  important  hearing  on  investing  in  re-
search  and  development  technologies  in  regard  to  electronic  waste  in  the  United
States.

In the U.S. and around the globe, everyday new technologies and electronics enter

lead,  mercury,  and  other  harmful  substances  that,  unless  properly  disposed  of,  can
contaminate our environment and present health dangers to our citizens. Estimates
from  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  have  shown  that  the  majority  of  these
retired  products  are  inevitably  sent  to  landfills  while  only  small  amounts  are  recy-
cled. This is partly due to the general lack of public awareness of the potential dan-
ger that these electronics pose to the environment, as well as a lack of any coherent
strategy from which to deal with electronic waste. This must change and I hope that
this draft legislation is an important first step in bringing about this change.

Also,  I  believe  it  is  our  responsibility  to  fundamentally  change  the  way  we  think
dealing with electronic waste. We cannot solely focus on electronic waste from a re-
cycling perspective; sustainable design which takes into account the entire life cycle
of an electronic must be a part of any new research and development that goes into
reducing, reusing and recycling our electronic waste.

To  the  witnesses  before  us  today,  I  want  to  thank  you  for  taking  the  time  out  of
your  busy  schedules  to  appear  before  us  and  I  look  forward  to  hearing  your  testi-
monies.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE HARRY E. MITCHELL

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As  American  consumers  attempt  to  keep  up  with  the  latest  technology  trends  by
purchasing  the  newest  cell  phones  and  laptops,  the  number  of  discarded  electronic
products is rapidly increasing.

When electronic products are properly handled, these products can transform into

a valuable source for reusable equipment.

However,  if  these  products  are  not  disposed  of  properly,  they  are  potentially

harmful to both human health and the environment.

Currently,  there  are  no  federal  regulations  in  place  for  the  appropriate  disposal

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN BILBRAY

Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall:

Thank you very much for holding this timely and important hearing. History will
show that the steps we take now on the issue of electronic waste (e-waste) will pay
monumental dividends down the road.

Throughout  our  living  rooms  and  newspapers  we  are  reminded  about  the  effect
that  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  water  pollution  and  wasteful  habits  are  having  on
polluting  our  environment.  Climate  change  is  a  frequent  term  from  playgrounds  to
nursing  homes.  Yet,  one  area  we  are  fundamentally  ignoring  is  the  effect  our  race
to be technologically superior is having on our world.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) between 1980 and 2004,
two  billion  electronic  products  were  sold  in  the  United  States.  Of  these,  EPA  esti-
mates that just over half are still in use, while 42 percent had been disposed of and
nine percent were in storage. These products contain harmful carcinogens and dead-
ly  plastics  that  are  a  threat  to  mankind  and  the  environment  when  not  properly
disposed.

Creating an efficient and safe recycling program, along with research and develop-
ment  to  reduce  the  toxic  components  of  e-waste  will  be  required  to  mitigate  this
problem. I am pleased to see that Sony Corporation, located in my district, has un-
dertaken one such effort.

On  August  20,  2007,  Sony  Corporation  launched  their  nationwide  program  titled
‘‘The  Sony  Take  Back  Recycling  Program.’’  This  innovative  recycling  approach  will
allow consumers to recycle all Sony products for free at 75 Waste Management Re-
cycle  America  eCycling  drop-off  centers  across  the  United  States.  Stan  Glasgow,
President  and  CEO  of  Sony  Electronics,  noted  in  a  statement  announcing  the  pro-
gram:  ‘‘Providing  the  highest  level  of  service  and  support  doesn’t  stop  once  a  pur-
chase is made. We believe it is Sony’s responsibility to provide customers with end-
of-life  solutions  for  all  the  products  we  manufacture.’’  Glasgow  further  stated,
‘‘Through  the  Take  Back  Recycling  Program,  our  customers  will  know  that  their
Sony products will be recycled in an environmentally responsible manner.’’

Private  corporations  alone  should  not  be  required  to  do  all  the  heavy  lifting.  The
Federal Government has a role to play in these efforts as well. It is estimated that
the Federal Government purchases up to $60 billion worth of electronic equipment.
This  is  millions  of  computers,  televisions,  telephones,  and  copiers.  If  we  are  going
to ask private citizens to take part in cleaning up their electronic waste, the govern-
ment must do the same.

This  month  I  will  be  re-introducing  legislation  that  will  require  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment  to  purchase  products  that  meet  EPA’s  Electronic  Product  Environmental
Assessment  tool  (EPEAT)  standards.  EPEAT  is  a  system  to  help  purchasers  in  the
public  and  private  sectors  evaluate,  compare  and  select  desktop  computers,  note-
books  and  monitors  based  on  their  environmental  attributes.  EPEAT  also  provides
a clear and consistent set of performance criteria for the design of products, and pro-
vides  an  opportunity  for  manufacturers  to  secure  market  recognition  for  efforts  to
reduce the environmental impact of its products. By procuring environmentally safe
products the Federal Government will do its part in protecting the environment.

As this committee goes forward with its work, I hope that we will have additional
opportunities  to  explore  ways  to  prevent  electronic  waste  from  contaminating  our
great nation.

Chair  GORDON.  Now,  Ms.  Biggert,  I  understand  you  are  on  a
short leash here today, and so we will now introduce the witnesses
and we will begin with you.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chair,  and  thank  you
for  the  opportunity  to  introduce  one  of  our  witnesses  to  the  Full
Committee  today.  It  is  my  pleasure  to  welcome  and  recognize  Mr.
Willie  Cade,  a  native  of  my  hometown,  Hinsdale,  Illinois,  and
owner  of  PC  Rebuilders  and  Recyclers  of  Chicago.  The  final  addi-
tion to our panel on electronic waste, his testimony promises to be
both informative and enlightening from his career in recycling elec-
tronics.

Since he founded his business in 2000, Mr. Cade has refurbished
and delivered over 40,000 computers for use in schools and not-for-
profit  organizations.  He  was  quickly  recognized  for  his  hard  work
and  talent  when  he  was  selected  as  the  first  Microsoft-authorized
refurbisher  in  the  United  States.  Recognizing  the  growing  preva-
lence  of  e-waste,  Mr.  Cade  went  a  step  further  and  co-founded  the
International Computer Refurbishers Summit, now in its sixth year
since  inception.  With  obvious  hands-on  experience,  Mr.  Cade  is  in
a unique position to educate policy-makers and the industry on the
realities  of  mitigating  the  electronic  waste  stream.  He  has  some
terrific suggestions on research and collaboration efforts as well as
ways to increase consumer awareness and participation.

So  Mr.  Cade,  we  look  forward  to  your  testimony  and  thank  you

for joining us today, and I yield back.

Chair GORDON. Thank you, Ms. Biggert.
To  help  offset  Dr.  Ehlers’  intellect,  we  have  a  top  draft  choice
here  today,  and  I  would  like  to  ask  unanimous  consent  that  Con-
gressman  Rush  Holt  from  New  Jersey  be  permitted  to  introduce  a
witness. Mr. Holt—or Dr. Holt, I should say.

Mr. HOLT. Thank you. ‘‘Representative’’ is fine.
Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair,  and  I  am  pleased  to  introduce,  to  com-
mend  and  to  recommend  to  my  colleagues  here  on  the  Committee,
Dr. Valerie Thomas to talk to you today. I have known Dr. Thomas
in  a  number  of  capacities  over  decades  now,  first  as  a  stellar  stu-
dent  in  my  electrodynamics  course  at  Swarthmore  College  and  as
a  participant  in  my  physics  and  public  policy  seminar,  later  as  a
superbly  active  citizen  when  she  and  her  family  lived  in  the  12th
Congressional  District  in  New  Jersey,  also  as  a  fine  musician  and

a wonderful mother. Dr. Thomas completed her Ph.D. in physics at
Cornell  after  graduating  from  Swarthmore,  and  now  serves  as  the
Anderson  interface  associate  professor  at  Georgia  Tech.  Her  re-
search,  among  other  things,  looks  at  efficient  use  of  materials  and
innovative  ways  to  manage  electronic  waste.  Over  the  years  she
has  conducted  really  outstanding  research  in  a  number  of  areas  of
interest to this committee.

In addition to her excellent science, I think Dr. Thomas really ex-
emplifies  the  potential  for  scientists  to  be  involved  in  public  policy
in an effective way. A few years back, Valerie was a Congressional
Science  Fellow  of  the  American  Physical  Society  and  worked  as  a
staff member in my office. So I have seen her from a variety of per-
spectives  and  she  really  is  superb.  Before  her  service  in  my  office,
she  served  as  a  lecturer  at  the  Woodrow  Wilson  School  of  Public
and  International  Affairs,  and  as  a  research  scientist  there  at
Princeton  University.  She  continues  her  commitment  to  bridge
science  and  public  policy  as  a  faculty  member  now  at  the  School
of International and Systems Engineering and the School of Public
Policy.

Mr.  Chair,  I  recommend  Valerie  Thomas  to  your  consideration

today.

Chair  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Congressman  Holt,  although  you
failed  to  mention  that  you  are  also  the  godfather  to  her  children,
and so for that reason you are going to be recused today.

Our next witness is Dr. Paul Anastas. He is the Teresa and John
Heinz  III  Professor  in  the  Practice  of  Chemistry  for  the  Environ-
ment and the Director of the Center of Green Chemistry and Green
Engineering,  the  School  of  Forestry  and  Environmental  Studies  at
Yale  University,  and  Mr.  Phillip  Bond  is  the  President  of
TechAmerica. I would like to yield to our friend, Congressman Wu,
for an introduction.

Mr. WU. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and it is my pleasure
to introduce a fellow Oregonian at today’s hearing. Mr. Omelchuck
is  the  Executive  Director  of  the  Green  Electronics  Council  located
in  Portland,  Oregon.  The  Green  Electronics  Counsel  oversees  the
Electronic  Product  Environmental  Assessment  Tool,  which  helps
manufacturers  and  consumers  market  and  purchase  environ-
mentally  friendly  electronic  products.  So  welcome,  Mr.  Omelchuck,
and  I  also  want  to  extend  a  warm  Oregon  welcome  to  Mr.  Bond,
who  is  a  graduate  of,  and  a  trustee  of,  Linfield  College  in
McMinnville, Oregon.

Chair  GORDON.  Well,  the  West  Coast  is  well  represented  here
today, and as witnesses know, we try to limit our testimony to five
minutes in terms of the spoken testimony. We have a copy of your
written  testimony  already.  So  we  will  now  start  with  Dr.  Thomas.

very kind introduction. I am Valerie Thomas and I am an associate
professor  at  Georgia  Tech  in  the  School  of  Industrial  and  Systems
Engineering.

It  is  widely  recognized  that  electronics  are  not  well  designed  for
recycling. The valuable components are hard to extract and difficult
to reuse. What is less well understood is that the electronics supply
chain  has  not  been  designed  for  recycling  either.  The  supply  chain
for making and selling electronics is a model of efficiency managed
with  electronic  data  interchange,  electronic  manifests,  radio-fre-
quency tags on pallets and cartons, and UPC codes on every single
package. In stark contrast, the end-of-life supply chain is managed
almost entirely by hand with little recordkeeping or even potential
for monitoring or oversight. That the results have included unsafe,
polluting,  and  illegal  activities  at  the  end-of-life  should  not  be  a
surprise.

Electronics are just one example of the myriad products that con-
sumers  and  businesses  are  increasingly  expected  to  recycle.  Major
efforts to increase electronics recycling have brought the rate up to
about  18  percent.  Major  efforts  to  encourage  battery  recycling  in-
cluding  the  1996  Mercury  Containing  and  Rechargeable  Battery
Management  Act  have  been  even  less  successful.  If  electronics  or
any  other  complex  or  hazardous  products  are  going  to  be  recycled
at  high  rates,  innovation  and  creative  use  of  technology  will  be
needed.

Electronics  could  have  a  standard  label  that  would  allow  recy-
clers  to  identify  the  make  and  model  of  the  product  and  manage
its recycling or refurbishment. These labels could be something like
UPC bar codes or they could be radio frequency ID (RFID) tags. In
a  small  project  sponsored  by  the  U.S.  EPA  (Environmental  Protec-
tion  Agency),  electronics  manufacturers,  retailers  and  recyclers,
and  in  fact  Willie  Cade  at  the  other  end  of  the  table  from  me  and
I  are  working  together  on  this,  are  beginning  to  work  out  how  to
use RFID to make electronics recycling work better.

Recycling  rates  for  electronics  are  low  because  collection  pro-
grams are difficult to use and because products are difficult to recy-
cle.  Products  need  to  be  designed  for  recycling  and  collection  pro-
grams  need  to  be  very  easy,  almost  automatic,  regardless  of  how
complex  the  product  is.  Currently,  consumers  are  mainly  respon-
sible  for  managing  recycling.  There  have  been  efforts  to  make  pro-
ducers responsible for recycling.

A third way might work better: improve both product design and
collection systems so that products can manage their own recycling.
Rather  than  having  to  continue  to  work  so  hard  to  educate  con-
sumers about how to recycle each and every one of their purchases,
products could almost manage themselves. For example, consumers
could  recycle  electronics  just  by  putting  them  in  their  curbside  re-
cycling bin. The bin could, or should, be able to automatically read
the label on the product and automatically arrange for pickup. The
recycler  or  the  recycler’s  computer  system  would  automatically  ar-
range  for  resale  or  recycling  and  the  consumer  would  get  a  rebate
for  that  item.  Basically  the  consumer  would  not  have  to  do  much
of  anything.  The  tag  on  the  product  would  put  everything  in  mo-
tion.

Electronics  recycling  is  important  but  it  occurs  in  a  larger  con-
text of energy use and manufacturing impacts, impacts of recycling
and  of  reuse.  Good  recycling  research  is  done  in  the  context  of  all
of the impacts of electronics and considers all alternatives.

And I would like to make one last point. Environmental problems
are  among  the  key  challenges  facing  the  world.  Students  want  to
solve  environmental  problems.  Courses  related  to  energy,  environ-
ment, and sustainability draw students in to the study of engineer-
ing.  At  Georgia  Tech,  our  environmental  courses  are  packed.  Sec-
tion 6 of the draft E-waste R&D Act supports environmental train-
ing  for  engineers.  This  would  not  only  help  to  solve  environmental
problems, it would also attract more students to engineering.

Thank  you  for  your  attention,  and  I  would  be  happy  to  answer

questions.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Thomas follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF VALERIE THOMAS

Disposal  or  recycling  of  electronics  can  have  significant  human  health  and  envi-
ronmental impacts. Electronics can contain lead, brominated flame retardants, cad-
mium, mercury, arsenic and a wide range of other metals and chemical compounds.
The recycling rate is, at best, about 18 percent, and most electronics collected in the
U.S.  for  recycling  have  been  sent  to  other  countries  for  processing  (US  EPA  2008).
In a 2008 report, the GAO found that a substantial fraction of these end up in coun-
tries  where  disposal  practices  are  unsafe  to  workers  and  dangerous  to  the  environ-
ment. Used electronics exported from the United States to some Asian countries are
dismantled  under  unsafe  conditions,  using  methods  like  open-air  incineration  and
acid  baths  to  extract  metals  such  as  copper  and  gold  (US  GAO,  2008;  Williams  et
al., 2008).

If it is carried out correctly, electronics recycling can prevent pollution, create jobs
and  save  resources.  Keeping  activities  such  as  sorting  and  reprocessing  of  elec-
tronics in the urban areas where they have been used and collected can provide sig-
nificant  economic  and  social  benefits  (Leigh  et  al.,  2007a,  2007b).  These  benefits
could be significantly enhanced if plans for recycling and refurbishment were incor-
porated into the design of the product and its supply chain.

It  is  widely  recognized  that  electronics  have  not  been  designed  for  recycling:  the
valuable components are hard to extract and difficult to reuse, and the valuable con-
stituents are mixed with a complex set of low value and potentially hazardous mate-
rials.

What is less well recognized is that the electronics supply chain also has not been
designed  for  recycling.  The  existing  supply  chain  for  manufacturing,  delivery,  and
retailing  of  electronics  is  a  model  of  efficiency,  managed  with  electronic  data  inter-
change,  electronic  manifests,  radio-frequency  tags  on  pallets  and  cartons,  and  UPC
codes  on  individual  product  packages.  These  kinds  of  supply  chain  innovations,  de-
veloped  over  the  past  thirty  years,  have  saved  money  and  allowed  for  the  efficient
production and retailing of tens of thousands of products. In stark contrast, the end-
of-life  supply  chain  is  managed  almost  entirely  by  hand,  with  little  record-keeping
or  even  potential  for  monitoring  or  oversight.  That  the  result  has  included  unsafe,
polluting, and illegal disposal activities should not be a surprise.

Electronics are just one example of the myriad products that consumers and busi-
nesses  are  increasingly  expected  to  recycle.  Recent  major  efforts  to  encourage  elec-
tronics  recycling  have  brought  the  recycling  rate  up  to  about  18  percent.  Major  ef-
forts  to  encourage  recycling  of  batteries—including  passage  of  the  1996  Mercury-
Containing and Rechargeable Battery Recycling Act—have been even less successful.
The  draft  E-Waste  R&D  Act  proposes  to  address  low  recycling  rates  by  ‘‘studying
factors  that  influence  behavior  and  educating  consumers  about  electronic  waste.’’
This will not be nearly enough. To achieve high collection rates, recycling programs
for  consumer  products  such  as  electronics  and  batteries  will  need  a  different  ap-
proach to collection.

If  electronics—or  any  other  complex  or  hazardous  product—are  going  to  be  recy-
cled  as  part  of  a  planned  and  well  managed  system,  supply  chain  innovation  is
needed.  Use  of  information  technology  to  manage  the  end-of-life  supply  chain  will
be especially important because there are thousands of different makes and models
of electronics products that enter the waste stream every year.

Electronics—and  other  complex  products  that  need  to  be  recycled—could  have  a
standardized label that would allow recyclers to identify the make and model of the
product and manage its recycling or refurbishment. These labels could be something
like  a  standard  UPC  bar  code  (Saar  et  al.,  2004).  Alternatively,  a  radio-frequency
identification  code  (RFID)  could  be  installed  inside  the  product  and  serve  the  same
function  while  being  easier  to  read  and  providing  more  information  (Thomas,  2008,
2009).

In a small project sponsored by the US EPA and convened by the RFID standards
organization,  EPCglobal,  recyclers,  electronics  manufacturers,  and  retailers  are  be-
ginning  to  think  through  how  electronics  recycling  could  be  improved  by  use  of
RFID  tags.  This  is  an  ongoing  project,  but  in  our  preliminary  report  (Maxwell,
2008), the group has concluded that potential benefits for manufacturers and retail-
ers include:

• increased efficiency and lower cost for recycling,
• opportunities for recycling incentives, rebates, coupons and trade-ins,
• improved warranty management, and
• better after-sale services.

Potential benefits for recyclers include:

• improved inventory control,
• more efficient product sorting and management,
• improved audit capabilities,
• integration of product data into online markets, and
• easier and less costly reporting to regulators and clients.

Better  management  of  today’s  recycling  programs  is  only  the  beginning  of  what
could be accomplished. The end-of-life management of electronics and other products
could  be  transformed  by  a  combination  of  improved  product  design,  innovative  on-
line  markets,  integration  of  information  technology  into  product  management,  and
supply  chain  innovations.  Already,  online  markets  such  as  eBay,  Craig’s  List,  and
Freecycle  have  made  the  reuse  and  refurbishment  of  electronics  easier  and  more
common.  Already,  companies  like  Recycle  Bank  use  RFID  codes  on  recycling  bins
to reward consumers for recycling.

In the future, consumers could start the process of recycling, reuse or resale sim-
ply  by  putting  their  unwanted  item  in  their  own  ‘‘smart’’  recycling  bin:  the  bin
would  automatically  read  the  label  on  the  product,  and  automatically  arrange  for
recycling  pick-up;  the  recycler,  receiving  information  in  advance  about  the  items  in
the  bin,  would  be  able  to  automatically  arrange  for  sorting  and  resale  or  recycling,
and  the  consumer  would  receive  a  rebate  for  recycling  that  specific  item,  based  on
its value or hazard. This kind of system places the capability to enter the collection
system  within  the  product  itself.  Rather  than  having  to  continue  to  work  so  hard
to  educate  consumers  about  how  to  recycle  each  and  every  one  of  their  purchases,
consumer  products  could,  almost,  manage  themselves  (Saar  and  Thomas,  2002;
Thomas, 2003).

Today,  recycling  programs  for  electronics  and  other  consumer  products  have  low
recycling  rates  both  because  collection  programs  are  difficult  for  consumers  to  use
and  because  the  products  are  difficult  to  recycle.  To  achieve  high  recycling  rates,
products  need  to  be  designed  for  recycling,  and  collection  programs  need  to  be  de-
signed  to  be  very  easy,  almost  automatic,  regardless  of  the  complexity  of  the  prod-
uct. Currently, consumers are mainly responsible for managing the recycling or dis-
posal of their products. In some locations there have been efforts to make producers
responsible  for  managing  the  recycling  or  disposal  of  their  products.  A  third  ap-
proach  might  work  better:  improve  both  product  design  and  collection  systems  so
that  products  can  increasing  manage  their  own  entry  into  the  collection  and  recy-
cling system.

With  respect  to  the  specifics  of  the  legislation:  The  draft  E-Waste  R&D  Act  will
be most effective if it takes into account the entire life cycle of electronics products.
Electronics  can  have  environmental  impacts  in  manufacturing  and  in  use  as  well
as  in  disposal.  Use  of  recycled  materials  or  components  can  reduce  the  environ-
mental impact of electronics production. In some cases reusing or refurbishing elec-
tronics will result in more energy use than would purchase of a new model; in other
cases  used  or  refurbished  electronic  devices  can  provide  more  environmental,  eco-
nomic  and  social  benefit  than  recycling.  A  research  program  that  focuses  only  on
end-of-life  has  the  potential  to  overlook  major  opportunities  for  reducing  the  envi-
ronmental impacts of electronics, and could be counter-productive. The research pro-
gram should consider the full life cycle of electronics.

With  respect  to  engineering  education:  The  Engineering  2020  study  from  the  Na-
tional Academy of Engineering has identified environmental issues as one of the key
challenges  facing  the  world  and  the  engineering  profession  now  and  in  the  coming
decades (NRC, 2002). Equally importantly, students realize that this important, and
courses  related  to  energy,  environment,  and  sustainability  can  draw  students  in  to
the  field  of  engineering.  Section  6  of  the  draft  E-Waste  R&D  Act  supports  the  con-
sideration of environmental consequences in undergraduate and graduate-level engi-
neering  curriculum.  Many  institutions  of  higher  education  have  already  made  sub-
stantial progress in this area. A recent survey shows that teaching and research in
sustainable engineering are part of the activities of most of the top 100 engineering
programs  in  the  United  States  (Murphy  et  al.,  2009).  At  my  own  institution,  the
Georgia  Institute  of  Technology,  almost  every  school  in  the  College  of  Engineering
has  environmental  offerings  at  both  the  undergraduate  and  graduate  level.  Yet
there is much to be done. By and large, the environmental aspects of the engineer-
ing curricula are at an introductory level. The next step is to develop the depth and
rigor that engineers will need, and that engineering departments will require for en-
vironmental  material  to  be  adopted  into  their  core  curricula.  Engineering  schools
are  well-prepared  to  take  the  next  steps,  and  support  for  this  work  would  be  wel-
comed.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  PAUL  T.  ANASTAS,  TERESA  AND  H.  JOHN
HEINZ  III  PROFESSOR  IN  THE  PRACTICE  OF  CHEMISTRY

CHEMISTRY AND GREEN ENGINEERING, YALE UNIVERSITY
Dr.  ANASTAS.  I  would  like  to  thank  you,  Chair  Gordon  and  the
Members of the Committee for the opportunity to comment on this
draft bill. My name is Paul Anastas. I am the Director of the Cen-
ter for Green Chemistry and Green Engineering at Yale University,
and I offer this testimony on behalf of myself and my Associate Di-
rector, Professor Julie Zimmerman. I want to compliment the Com-
mittee on addressing this serious issue of e-waste and the draft bill
has many excellent professions that I certainly endorse.

The  main  message  that  I  would  like  to  make  to  the  Committee
today is really threefold. One is that if we are going to look at the
issue  of  waste—electronic  waste—it  cannot  be  waste  alone  but  de-
sign  throughout  the  entire  life  cycle  of  electronics;  second,  that
there  are  design  frameworks  that  exist  currently  to  ensure  that
electronics  are  able  to  be  green  and  sustainable;  and  third,  that
through  research  and  development,  we  are  able  to  not  only  ensure
that  they  meet  environmental  goals  but  also  economic  goals  and
performance goals.

So  first  a  few  words  about  waste.  When  we  look  at  the  issue  of
how you design any electronic, it is important to know that looking
at  waste  alone  is  not  going  to  do  anything  for  the  manufacturers
and  assemblers  and  exposing  them  to  hazardous  substances.  We
know  that  in  a  typical  cell  phone,  there  are  approximately  60  ele-
ments in the periodic table that are used in cell phones today, and
focusing  on  waste  is  not  going  to  address  that  issue.  It  is  also  of
note that we only have reliable information on approximately seven
of  those  elements  in  terms  of  what  our  supplies  are  and  what  our
usage  is.  So  focusing  on  the  design  allows  us  to  not  only  meet  our
waste goals but also build in performance, build in capabilities and
build  in  profitability  while  addressing  these  hazardous  waste  sub-
stances.  It  allows  us  to  ensure  the  materials  that  are  used  are  be-
nign,  non-bioaccumulative,  non-endocrine  disrupting  and  allows  us
to get higher performance at the same time.

The sustainable design frameworks, there have been principles of
green  chemistry  and  green  engineering  in  the  literature  for  some
time  that  have  been  used  across  industry  sectors.  It  is  often  said
that the compass is more important than the speedometer and that
we  need  to  know  what  the  ‘‘true  north’’  of  sustainable  design  is.
Just in the past few years, Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge
Awards  have  shown  that  companies  across  industry  sectors  from
chemicals to plastics to polymers to pharmaceuticals to agriculture
and,  yes,  to  electronics,  have  eliminated  enough  hazardous  sub-
stances, according to the EPA, to fill a train car hundreds of miles

long. Now, they didn’t do this because of a regulation or ‘thou shall
do  green  chemistry  and  green  engineering,’  it  is  because  you  can
meet environmental and economic goals simultaneously.

So  with  all  of  these  good  news  stories,  with  all  of  these  historic
accomplishments,  that  is  good  news,  but  the  better  news  is,  this
represents a fraction of the power and the potential of these green
design  frameworks,  and  for  every  one  product  that  has  been  rede-
signed  in  this  way,  there  are  hundreds,  perhaps  thousands,  that
have not even been considered in these new frameworks. So the po-
tential  is  immense,  and  one  of  the  things  that  is  absolutely  re-
quired  is  fundamental  research.  I  could  list  off  the  various  areas
necessary  for  dematerialization  such  as  nanotechnology,  benign
materials, alternative chemicals that are not persistent, bioaccumu-
lating and toxic, molecular self-assembly, but that is detailed in my
written testimony.

There  are  examples  of  very  productive  industry-university  coop-
erative  research  programs  that  can  be  used  as  models  for  this  bill
including  the  technology  for  sustainable  environment  at  EPA  and
industry-university  partnerships  out  of  the  NSF  (National  Science
Foundation).

I  would  just  like  to  conclude  by  saying  that  I  view  the  funda-
mental research areas that I briefly listed as the bricks that make
up the structure of sustainable electronics. The framework for sus-
tainable  design,  the  green  chemistry  and  green  engineering  prin-
ciples,  are  the  mortar  that  hold  those  bricks  together.  The  struc-
ture  can  only  stand,  can  only  be  strong,  can  only  be  stable  with
both  of  these  elements,  that  is,  the  fundamental  research  within
the sustainable design frameworks.

That said, I would like to thank you again and I would be happy

to answer questions at an appropriate time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PAUL T. ANASTAS AND

JULIE B. ZIMMERMAN

Chairman  Gordon,  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  am  pleased  to  testify  today  on
the  topic  of  the  proposed  E-Waste  R&D  program.  My  name  is  Paul  Anastas  and  I
am the Teresa and H. John Heinz III Professor in the Practice of Chemistry for the
Environment and the Director for the Center for Green Chemistry and Green Engi-
neering at Yale University.

The  bill  under  discussion  today  centers  on  the  problem  of  e-waste.  My  testimony
focuses  on  considering  solutions  to  this  problem  from  a  broader  context.  E-waste,
like  waste  of  any  kind,  is  fundamentally  an  end-of-pipe  problem.  To  truly  address
this  issue  in  a  meaningful  and  permanent  sense,  a  research  program  should  be  de-
signed to tackle it at its source—at the design-level of the products. Though creating
the infrastructure and technologies necessary to manage and reuse waste materials
is  an  important  short-term  goal,  the  enormous  growth  projected  for  the  electronics
sector is also an opportunity to re-imagine how these products are designed and at-
tempt to eliminate not only the notion of waste, but also the environmental impacts
of electronics on humans and the environment throughout their life cycle. My testi-
mony seeks to make the following key points:

1. E-waste  is  a  serious  and  growing  problem  and  yet  it  is  only  one  aspect  of

the much larger issue as we seek to move toward sustainable electronics.

2. Waste is one egregious symptom of flawed design. With improved design, we
can address not only the waste issue but also the important issues of energy
usage,  worker/assembler  safety,  depletion  of  scarce,  rare,  and  precious  met-
als,  and  the  reduction  of  toxics  use  and  replacement  with  benign  alter-
natives.

3. Sustainable  design  frameworks  exist  to  achieve  these  goals  including  the

Principles of Green Chemistry and the Principles of Green Engineering.

4. Significant research challenges exist and can be addressed through thought-
ful  investment  by  the  Federal  Government  in  academic  research  in  partner-
ship with the private sector.

5. Advances  in  sustainable  design  of  electronics  can  lead  to  improvements  in
overall environmental performance, including waste, while at the same time
creating  innovations  in  functional  performance  that  enhances  jobs  and  com-
petitiveness.

Introduction

Electronic devices are a central feature of our daily lives. We rely on them for ev-
erything  from  communicating  with  our  loved  ones  to  monitoring  our  blood  glucose
to ensuring that our cars respond intelligently to changing road conditions.

Not only do electronics provide us with a vast array of personal benefits, but they
also  have  a  potentially  significant  role  to  play  in  sustainable  development.  For  ex-
ample,  electronics  could  lead  to  greater  environmental  sustain  ability  by  signifi-
cantly  reducing  the  need  for  transport,  leading  to  the  dematerialization  of  certain
products  (such  as  the  virtual  provision  of  multimedia),  or  providing  improved  envi-
ronmental  monitoring  capacity.  With  recent  concern  over  global  climate  change,
large-scale  efficiency  gains  resulting  from  information  and  communication  tech-
nology  (ICT)  use  across  sectors  are  seen  as  a  key  tool  for  transitioning  to  a  lower-
carbon  world  and  facilitating  low-carbon  development.1 On  the  social  development
side, ICT can facilitate general access to knowledge, build community-organizing ca-
pacity, and provide access to local and global markets. All of these are dramatically
under-served needs in the developing world.

Sustainable  development  will  require  that  the  services  provided  by  electronics
continue  to  be  made  available  to  an  ever-widening  pool  of  consumers.  The  impor-
tance  and  value  of  electronics  and  their  ability  to  offset  other  environmental  prob-
lems  are  often  used  to  excuse  their  own  environmental  impact.  However,  even  a
small impact subject to the scale of production that electronic devices will see in the
coming  decades  would  be  unacceptably  large.  It  is  even  more  daunting  to  consider
that  electronics  have  one  of  the  largest  impacts  per  unit  mass  out  of  any  product
category. Electronic devices are inherently complex—they contain hundreds of mate-
rials, many of which are toxic, and require extremely precise structure and assembly
on  a  minute  scale,  making  them  very  resource-intensive  to  produce.  As  electronic
devices  become  increasingly  central  to  human  life,  we  need  to  develop  ways  to
sustainably  provide  their  key  services  without  tacitly  accepting  the  problems  they
currently bring with them.

Thus  far,  industry’s  understandable  initial  response  to  these  concerns  has  been
to  embark  on  a  program  of  incremental  improvement—making  each  generation  of
products  slightly  less  toxic,  slightly  more  energy  efficient,  slightly  ‘‘less  bad.’’  How-
ever,  in  a  time  characterized  by  explosive  growth  in  the  worldwide  use  of  elec-
tronics,  a  commitment  to  incremental  improvement  is  not  sufficient.  Nor  will  even
a reasonably effective end-of-pipe waste management system for the e-waste stream
sufficiently  address  the  material  throughput  or  toxicity  issues  that  are  already  ap-
parent. We cannot solve an exponential increase in problems with a linear decrease
in impact.

Our longer-term research priorities must be targeted toward the drastic reduction
of  both  the  volume  and  the  toxicity  of  this  waste  stream  through  concerted  efforts
at  better  design.  We  need  to  clearly  define  the  challenges  we  hope  to  tackle,  and
then  address  them  in  a  more  creative  and  innovative  manner  than  has  thus  far
been applied. This approach will also require efforts to build our long-term capacity
for innovation, through the building of a sustain ability knowledge base throughout
our nation’s engineering programs. The good news is that sustainable electronics are
possible. We have the tools and design frameworks required for getting on the right
path. However, to overcome a challenge, we must first recognize it as a challenge—
and define our targets appropriately.

The Electronics-Manufacturing Sector: Historic & Current Problems

23

The  electronics-manufacturing  sector  is  characterized  by  quick  product  turnover,
complicated  and  globalized  production  chains,  capital  intensity,  a  high  level  of
outsourcing, and a global material footprint. A typical computer contains over 1,000
components,  whose  raw  materials  draw  on  the  majority  of  the  periodic  table.  It’s
usual for these components to be manufactured and assembled in different parts of
the  world—for  example,  semiconductor  chips  made  in  Scotland,  a  disk  drive  made
in  the  Philippines,  an  LCD  monitor  made  in  South  Korea,  circuit  boards  fabricated
in China and assembled in Taiwan, and the final product assembled in Mexico.2 In
2005, only 25 percent of production was done ‘‘in house,’’ with 75 percent outsourced
to contract manufacturers, primarily in Asia.3

Environmental  concerns  for  electronic  devices,  can  be  broken  down  into  three

major categories:

— The use of hazardous and toxic substances
— Resource and energy intensity
— The loss of materials and their embedded value to the waste stream

The  complexity  of  electronic  products  represents  an  investment  of  energy,  water,
and  processing  time  that  goes  far  beyond  the  basic  value  of  their  structural  mate-
rials.  For  example,  the  production  of  a  memory  chip  requires  about  600  times  its
weight  in  fossil  fuel.  This  is  at  least  an  order  of  magnitude  higher  than  any  other
product  category—for  comparison:  the  production  of  a  car  requires  1–2  times,  and
an aluminum can requires 4–5 times its weight in fossil fuel.4

Many  electronic  products,  especially  older  models,  contain  substantial  quantities
of  hazardous  substances.  For  example,  older  cathode  ray  tubes  (CRTs)  contain  be-
tween  four  and  seven  pounds  of  lead.5 In  2003,  the  High  Density  Packaging  User
Group (HDPUG) conducted an industry-wide survey of the material composition pro-
files  of  certain  IT  components.  Using  methodologies  ranging  from  analytical  testing
to  surveys  and  literature  reviews,  they  categorized  what  they  considered  to  be  the
environmentally  relevant  materials  present  in  electronic  equipment  based  on  tox-
icity and volume. The chart below presents a summary of their findings.

In addition to these substances of concern identified by the HDPUG group, many
others  are  often  highlighted,  including:  halogenated  and  other  ozone-depleting  sub-
stances  (i.e.,  CFCs),  plasticizers,  refractory  ceramic  fibers,  asbestos,  lithium,  and
copper  (which,  along  with  arsenic  and  nickel,  can  catalyze  the  increase  of  dioxins
during incineration).7

The  loss  of  material  to  the  waste  stream  is  really  a  problem  with  three  distinct

sub-categories, which build on the problems already discussed:

— reducing the volume of waste entering landfills
— reducing pollution caused by the toxic content of disposed electronics
— closing material loops and recovering the economic value of materials

The  disposal  and  recycling  of  waste  electronics  has  become  an  international  and
multidimensional  issue.  A  great  deal  of  attention  is  often  paid  to  the  volume  of  e-
waste  entering  the  waste  stream.  The  volume  is  significant—the  U.S.  EPA  esti-
mates that more than 3.2 million tons of electronic waste enters U.S. landfills every
year8 and that this volume will continue to grow rapidly in the coming decades, the
more  significant  problem  with  e-waste  relates  to  its  qualitative  characteristics.  E-
waste  is  expensive  to  manage  properly  because  of  its  bulk,  small  components,  and
toxic constituents. This distinguishes e-waste from ordinary garbage, while simulta-
neously making it particularly important to manage properly. However, from an eco-
nomic  perspective,  only  some  subsets  of  e-waste  make  financial  sense  to  recover,
while the bulkiest ones (plastics) must be dealt with at a cost.

The off-shoring and improper recycling of e-waste has resulted in unsafe working
conditions for thousands of workers in the developing world. In a many cases, ‘‘recy-
cling’’  of  e-waste  involves  burning  parts  over  open  pit  fires  in  order  to  melt  solder
and  separate  out  valuable  components.  A  recent  study  examining  heavy  metal  con-
tamination  levels  in  Guiyu,  China,  a  village  heavily  involved  in  e-waste  recycling,
found  that  levels  of  lead  and  copper  in  road  dust  were  371  and  155  times  higher,
respectively, than in a non-e-waste recycling site 30 kilometers away. The contami-
nation  levels  in  the  village  were  likely  to  pose  significant  health  risks,  particularly
to  children,  which  the  authors  correlated  with  body  loading  studies  done  in  the
same region.9 Exposure to high levels of heavy metals can result in both acute and

chronic health conditions ranging from damage to the nervous system, and changes
to blood composition, lung, kidney, and liver functioning.10

Rapid  technological  advances  in  the  electronics  sector  result  in  quick  product
turnover.  This  rapid  turnover  is  exacerbated  by  fashion-  and  software-driven  hard-
ware  obsolescence.  The  average  lifespan  for  a  PC  manufactured  in  2005  was  esti-
mated to be two years.11 Though demand for electronic devices in the industrialized
world  continues  to  grow,  the  most  significant  growth  is  occurring  in  developing
countries.  Today  only  10  percent  of  China’s  population  of  1.3  billion  owns  a  com-
puter.  By  2020  that  number  is  projected  to  rise  to  70  percent.  By  that  same  year,
half the world’s population will own a mobile phone and almost a third of the global
population will have a PC (currently one in 50).12 This translates to over four billion
PCs in active use worldwide.

Not  only  does  this  imply  a  massive  increase  in  the  production  of  electronic  de-
vices,  but  it  will  also  necessitate  greater  network  capacity  to  support  their  energy
needs,  more  materials  to  allow  for  their  manufacture,  and  the  creation  of  an  infra-
structure for their end-of-life management.

The  topics  touched  on  here  are  likely  to  be  covered  in  more  detail  in  other  testi-
monies.  However,  I  would  like  to  draw  attention  to  a  few  areas,  which  I  believe  do
not get sufficient attention, and which should guide the development of research pri-
orities in this field.

The  first  is  what  I  believe  to  be  an  insufficient  focus  on  the  toxicity  of  some  of
the  material  components  of  electronic  devices.  Many  industry  representatives  point
to  the  incremental  improvements  achieved  in  recent  generations  of  electronic  prod-
ucts  and  consider  this  a  successful  stopping  point  for  the  elimination  of  toxic  and
hazardous materials. However, the fact remains that electronic devices still contain
many  hazardous  materials.  What  we  should  ultimately  be  aiming  for  is  the  total
elimination of toxic and hazardous materials in these products. Only when products
are truly benign will their mass production not pose a substantial threat to workers,
users, and those handling the equipment at end-of-life. Truly benign products do not
pose  an  inherent  risk—they  can  be  handled  properly  or  mishandled  without  any
threat to humans or the environment. This is not an easy or short-term proposition,
but it is the goal that we should at least be aspiring to achieve. Perhaps, and likely,
this cannot be achieved through the search for direct analogues of existing toxic ma-
terials. Instead, we can focus on shifting towards new technological avenues. For ex-
ample,  rather  than  replacing  the  lead  in  cathode  ray  tubes  with  a  benign  alter-
native, we instead replaced CRTs with an entirely different technology.

Another  issue,  which  is  only  infrequently  touched  upon,  is  the  question  of  mate-
rial  scarcity.  The  operating  assumption  within  the  high  tech  manufacturing  indus-
try  is  that  sufficient  material  exists  to  continue  satisfying  the  enormous  and  grow-
ing  demand  for  electronics.  However,  these  assumptions  are  not  always  grounded
in  firm  data—because  in  many  cases,  the  data  does  not  exist.  We  generally  have
a very poor understanding of the material quantities that we consume, or how con-
sistently  we  can  expect  those  flows  to  continue.  One  example  particularly  relevant
to the electronics sector is that of tantalum, a scarce metal that is essential for the
manufacture of capacitors and resistors. At the very least we should attempt to bet-
ter quantify the stocks and flows of various resources through the electronics sector
to improve our capacity for impact assessment.

Finally,  I  would  like  to  draw  attention  to  the  potential  of  emerging  technologies.
These  nascent  technologies  including  molecular  self-assembly,  nanotechnology  and
nanomaterials, self-healing polymers, organic batteries and others, offer the promise
of  not  merely  meeting  environmental  goals  but  also  dramatically  increasing  per-
formance  and  competitiveness.  Only  though  proper  support  for  the  basic  research
and development of these innovative new fields can the power and potential of these
green chemistry and green engineering solutions be realized.

Frameworks for Sustainable Design

It  has  become  widely  accepted  that  any  consideration  of  product  sustainability
should take into account the entire product life cycle—from raw material acquisition
and manufacturing, through use, to disposal.

Looking at the entire life cycle helps prevent ‘‘problem shifting.’’ For example, en-
ergy-saving compact fluorescent light bulbs save a great deal of electricity, but rep-
resent  a  life  cycle  trade-off  because  they  contain  mercury—thus  shifting  environ-

mental burden from the use phase to manufacturing and end-of-life. Examining the
whole  life  cycle  also  helps  standardize  the  environmental  burden  against  the  unit
of service provided—for example, a disposable cup may have a much lower environ-
mental  cost  than  a  metal  travel  mug,  but  the  metal  travel  mug  is  capable  of  pro-
viding  hundreds  of  uses  in  comparison  with  the  disposable’s  single  use.  A  key  step
in  optimizing  any  system  requires  an  objective  look  at  where  the  largest  areas  for
improvement lie within the system as a whole.

Several  frameworks  for  sustainable  design,  all  of  which  take  a  life  cycle  perspec-
tive,  have  become  well  established  over  the  past  decade,  among  them  the  12  Prin-
ciples  of  Green  Chemistry  and  the  12  Principles  of  Green  Engineering.13 Though  it
is unnecessary to go into the details of this design framework here, it implies some
key approaches for responding to the problems outlined above through re-design:

1. Eliminate or severely reduce toxicity (toward zero hazard)

• Materials and energy sourcing—By  changing  the  nature  of  the  mate-
rials and energy that are input into the process of making electronics, we
can dramatically improve all aspects of the life cycle stages of electronics
including that of e-waste.

Æ Reduce  the  use  of  hazards  wherever  possible  (i.e.,  replacing  toxic
flame  retardants,  plasticizers,  mercury,  lead,  and  arsenic—con-
taining substances, etc.).

Æ Design  new  materials,  plastics,  composites  and  alloys  that  increase

performance while reducing toxicity.

Æ Ensure  that  the  new  materials  are  designed  such  that  included  as
part  of  functional  performance  are  things  like  non-persistence,  non-
bioaccumulation,  degradability,  non-mutagenic/non-carcinogenic,  and
non-endocrine disrupting.

2. Close the material loop (achieve zero waste)

• Design  for  reuse  and  end-of-life.  The  primary  goal  for  end-of-life  de-
sign for electronics should be to retain the embedded complexity of these
products  because  they  are  so  resource-intensive  to  produce.  Functional
components should be re-used whole as a first priority, recycled for their
raw  materials  as  a  second  priority,  and  appropriately  disposed  of  as  a
last resort.

Æ Incorporate take-back schemes
Æ Reduce material diversity
Æ Improve the ease of product disassembly
Æ Incorporate  renewable/biodegradable  materials  wherever  possible

and advisable

• Think broadly about possible material synergies outside of the in-

dustry.

Æ Can  waste  products  be  sold  as  feedstock  to  other  industries?  Exam-
ple:  IBM  is  reported  to  have  recently  begun  selling  its  information-
scoured silicon chips as a feedstock for solar panels.14

Æ Can  other  industries’  wastes  be  purchased  as  feedstock? 15 Example:
University  of  Delaware  Professor  Richard  Wool’s  chicken-feather-
based circuit boards, which take an existing waste-stream (three bil-
lion  pounds  of  chicken  feathers  are  disposed  of  annually)  and  use  it
as  a  feedstock  to  make  a  more  efficient  circuit  board  than  the  con-
ventional version.16

3. Optimize resource use at the design stage (for energy, materials, and

time)

• Determine and design for optimal product lifetime—Extending use-
ful  product  life  for  most  electronics  would  lead  to  overall  energy  and  re-
source savings. This is also supported by recent life cycle analysis studies
that  have  shown  that  the  use  phase  only  comprises  about  20  percent  of
total energy consumption over the lifetime of an electronic device.17 How-
ever we must also balance this with the concerns of ‘‘locking-in’’ resources
into  technologies  that  may  become  obsolete  or  that  may  be  perceived  to
be obsolete by style-conscious consumers.

Æ Therefore,  product  lifetimes  should  be  increased,  but  provisions

should be made for adaptability and upgradeability.

Æ Modular  options  could  provide  trend-conscious  consumers  with  ex-
changeable  components  for  a  new  product  appearance.  These  style
upgrades could largely go on within companies out of customer view.
• Select  production  methodologies  that  are  as  efficient  as  possible
• Select materials that deliver functionality with minimal resource
• Expand the number of services delivered by any single device

input

Specific Research Priorities

The high turnover in the electronics sector is often framed as a problem, but from
a  sustainable  design  perspective  it  can  also  be  seen  as  an  opportunity.  With  tech-
nology  advancing  rapidly,  each  new  generation  of  products  is  the  chance  to  try
something  new  and  truly  break  out  of  existing  technological  paradigms.  However,
there are certain problems that will need to be dealt with sooner than others.

Innovations in areas ranging from chemistry and materials science to systems en-
gineering  and  policy  will  be  required  to  effectively  address  the  problem  of  e-waste.

Æ Short-term

• Up-cycling historic wastes—

Æ Research on the transformation or destruction of current toxics.
Æ Determine the applications for the direct re-use of electronics, compo-
nent re-use, or recycling—with the goal of retaining as much embed-
ded complexity as possible.

Æ Nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize a number of indus-
tries  through  the  creation  of  materials  with  novel  physical  prop-
erties.  This  area  needs  to  be  thoroughly  investigated  in  order  to
maximize its potential benefits in the electronics sector while design-
ing  through  newly  emerging  Green-Nano  programs  to  reduce  the  in-
trinsic of toxicity and eco-toxicity.

• Improve  design  for  disassembly  to  enhance  the  reuse  and
recyclability  of  new  products—both  through  new  recycling  tech-
nologies and new product design.

Æ Research  new  material  joining  options  such  as  fasteners,  welds,  ad-

hesives

Æ Examine  the  potential  for  the  use  of  new  materials  developed

through bio-based and molecular self-assembly techniques

• Improve the recycling infrastructure

Æ Educate consumers about electronic waste
Æ Facilitate the collection of electronic products

• Extend useful product life

Æ Determine the factors that lead to technological failure

• Conduct basic research on materials and life cycle impacts

Æ Support  data-gathering  programs  that  will  allow  for  the  completion
of  Life  Cycle  Analyses  (LCAs)  and  Material  Flow  Accounts  (MFAs)
The  toxic  materials  contained  in  older  electronic  products  that  will  hit  the  waste
stream in the next 10 years are a potentially serious environmental problem. Effec-

tive  ways  of  managing  these  legacy  products  remain  an  unresolved  challenge.  Im-
proving recycling technology to be able to safely extract valuable materials from this
waste stream will be one of the earliest priorities.

Plastics  present  another  challenge  because  although  they  constitute  a  large  part
of  the  volume  of  the  e-waste  stream,  however  they  represent  a  low  fraction  of  the
value, which does not create economic incentive for their recovery. In the near-term,
one  of  the  solutions  to  this  problem  will  be  to  research  alternative  uses  for  the
mixed  plastic  stream  that  can  be  extracted  from  legacy  electronics.  A  market  for
these  materials  needs  to  be  established  if  we  wish  to  successfully  divert  them  from
landfills and other disposal options.

To  avoid  these  very  problems  with  future  generations  of  electronic  products,  an
immediate,  concerted  research  effort  should  be  directed  at  designing  components
and materials that are easily separable and recoverable. For materials used in very
minute  quantities,  advanced  separation  techniques  should  be  explored.  This  is,  a
key priority for putting an immediate dent into the future e-waste stream.

Historically, the ‘‘use phase’’ of electric and electronic equipment has been consid-
ered  the  most  important  energy-consuming  phase  of  the  product  life  cycle.  Though
this  holds  true  for  large  appliances  such  as  washing  machines  and  refrigerators,  in
the  case  of  most  personal  electronic  devices  such  as  computers,  the  majority  of  re-
source  consumption  and  energy  usage  occurs  before  the  product  even  reaches  the
consumer.  A  now  widely  cited  study  found  that  the  life  cycle  energy  burden  of  a
computer is dominated by the production phase (81 percent) as opposed to operation
(19  percent).18 This  is  one  of  the  major  reasons  that  extending  the  usable  lifespan
of  ICT  devices  has  been  identified  by  many  groups  as  a  potentially  promising  ap-
proach to mitigating their environmental impact.19

An  important  problem  for  evaluating  the  environmental  sustainability  of  elec-
tronic  products  is  the  lack  of  sufficient  information  on  life  cycle  impacts.  Because
of insufficient data, we don’t even know how much of certain materials (such as pre-
cious  metals)  we  are  using,  and  how  quickly  we  are  depleting  our  existing  stock.
It  is  estimated  that  the  typical  mobile  phone  made  today  contains  approximately
sixty  chemical  elements  from  the  Periodic  Table.  Of  these,  we  may  have  adequate
data on the supplies and usage rates of eight of them. This is something that needs
to be remedied through basic research.

Æ Mid-term

• Begin to phase out toxics
• Investigate new materials and improve existing functionalities

Æ Develop new display technologies
Æ Improve energy storage capability

• Basic material research on polymers, composites, and conducting

organic materials.

A  central  tenet  in  the  12  Principles  of  Green  Chemistry  is  that  we  should  strive
to  eliminate  toxic  and  hazardous  materials  to  the  greatest  extent  possible  through-
out  their  life  cycle.  Though  the  ultimate  goal  of  product  re-design  should  be  the
elimination of toxic and hazardous substances, this process will need to be carefully
managed  and  not  forced  through  by  over-eager  legislation.  The  trade-offs  of  elimi-
nating  certain  toxic  substances  for  alternative  materials  appear  to  be  highly  uncer-
tain  in  some  areas,  and  have  often  led  to  heated  debates,  particularly  just  prior  to
the adoption of definitive regulatory measures. Among several recent examples, one
of the most prominent is the regulatory push to eliminate lead.

Consumer electronics constitute 40 percent of the lead found in landfills,20 largely
originating  from  cathode  ray  tube  (CRT)  monitors,  but  also  present  in  significant
quantities  in  printed  circuit  boards.  Lead  is  well  known  to  have  neurotoxic  effects
and  presents  a  particular  risk  for  children.  The  recently  adopted  RoHS  directive  in
the  European  Union,  which  has  been  in  effect  since  July  1,  2006,  has  severely  re-
stricted the use of lead in any new electronic devices, particularly in solders, which
forces  manufacturers  interested  in  continuing  sales  in  the  EU  market  to  switch  to
alternatives.

Tin-lead  solders  have  been  used  for  over  half  a  century,  and  shifting  to  alter-

natives has raised concern about the performance of the alternatives.

Therefore,  it  is  important  to  innovate  truly  better  alternatives  to  existing  toxic
products, and not prematurely stifle the process through legislative bans in the ab-
sence  of  the  necessary  research  on  the  green  chemistry  alternatives.  This  funda-
mental research is essential to meeting the genuine goals of moving away from toxic
materials in ways that don’t cause unintended environmental, health, and economic
consequences.

Æ Long-term

• Material basis of computers

Æ Non-depleting
Æ Non-rare, scarce, toxic metals
Æ Non-persistent, non-accumulating, non-toxic materials

• Focus on new dematerialized product conceptions

Æ Nanoscale materials and components
Æ Molecular self-assembly
Æ Biomimetic devices

• Strive for holistic applications of green design

Æ Dematerialize—use  fewer  devices  with  less  overall  material  to  pro-

vide the same services

Æ Close  material  loops—cease  to  design  products  whose  components

cannot be fully recovered for some kind of use

The ultimate message is that green chemistry and engineering principles can only
lead  to  sustainability  if  they  are  applied  systematically.  Incremental  improvements
along specific problem trajectories are essential stepping stones, but the full-fledged,
system-wide  adoption  of  these  design  foundations  calls  for  transformative  break-
throughs—both  in  products  themselves  and  in  the  logistical  systems  we  have  in
place  for  managing  them  and  their  waste  streams.  This  integrated  approach  to  de-
sign is the only way to truly address the e-waste problem.

These key transformative innovations will likely rely heavily on dematerialization
and  will  probably  make  use  of  technologies  that  are  currently  unknown  or  just
emerging,  such  as  nanoscale  self-assembly,  self-healing  materials,  programmed  de-
composition, biological mining and recovery (for minute quantities of valuable mate-
rials).

The ultimate goal is to create products that can provide increased benefits to our
society  and  our  economy—on  energy  that  is  renewable,  made  of  materials  that  are
benign,  and  based  on  renewable  and  reusable  feedstocks.  This  vision  is  the  goal  of
perfection  we  seek  through  green  chemistry  and  green  engineering  and  it  is  only
through holding out goals of perfection—the ‘‘true north’’—that we guarantee contin-
uous improvement rather than settling for half-solutions and comprises.

The  E-Waste  R&D  program  that  is  ultimately  established  should  be  as  visionary
and broad looking as possible in its scope, and avoid treating the problem of e-waste
as a single, narrow challenge.

Program Structure

Research and Education—There are many models in the Federal Government that
have been successful in ensuring the same general goals that are sought by this leg-
islation:

1. Excellence in research
2. Partnership with industry
3. Integrating education
4. Sound science basis for policy inputs

Some of the outstanding models that could be considered in this research include
the  Industry—University  Cooperative  Research  Centers  that  are  funded  out  of  the
National  Science  Foundation;  the  Technology  for  a  Sustainable  Environment  Pro-
gram that until recently was funded out of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agen-
cy and part of an interagency program with NSF had an excellent track record; and
the  Integrated  Graduate  Education  and  Research  Training  (IGERT)  grants  provide
and excellent model that could be adapted to partnerships with industry. There are
also  the  excellent  examples  of  Engineering  Research  Centers  (ERCs)  and  Science

30

and  Technology  Research  Centers  (STCs)  that  have  very  productive  industry/aca-
demic partnerships for research and education.

Leveraging research—In addition to the establishment of centers dedicated to this
important  area,  it  would  also  be  worth  considering  how  to  leverage  the  portfolio  of
existing research that will greatly impact future electronics. Those projects in areas
such as nanotechnology, polymers and materials, electrical engineering, product de-
sign, metallurgy, and others currently funded by federal research programs because
of  their  direct  and  important  relevance  to  electronics.  By  ensuring  that  the  next
round of program solicitations supporting this research contain requirements for the
principal investigator to discuss potential environmental and human health benefits
of their work and the use of this information as criteria in a funding decision. This
could have a tremendous positive impact on funding for the field.

Policy Issues

The  successful  implementation  of  the  outcomes  of  this  endeavor  will  additionally
need to be supported by innovative policy frameworks in order to function efficiently
and to provide incentives for the adoption of environmentally superior designs.

It  should  be  noted  that  ‘‘product  stewardship’’  or  Extended  Producer  Responsi-
bility  (EPR)  concepts  as  implemented  in  existing  e-waste  legislation  have  not  been
effective,  and  seem  unlikely  to  become  effective,  at  changing  product  design.  This
is  because,  for  both  economic  and  environmental  reasons,  almost  all  product  recov-
ery  and  recycling  systems  are  collective—they  handle  all  manufacturers’  products
collectively.  While  manufacturers  may  pay  for  their  share  of  the  waste  collected,  or
their share of products produced, no system has yet been developed to provide a fi-
nancial incentive for individual manufacturers to make their products easier to recy-
cle.  In  addition,  the  collective  nature  of  both  the  end-of-life  system  and  the  compo-
nent  supply  chain  makes  it  difficult  for  individual  electronics  manufacturers  to
adopt dramatic innovations for the reduction of environmental impact.

Another  big  source  of  contention  regarding  electronics  recycling  has  been  the
search for an appropriate financing system. State and local governments would like
to  see  manufacturer-financed  recycling  programs  because  not  enough  funding  is
available  for  government-financed  options.21 However,  the  cost  of  compliance  with
even  a  single  law  can  be  a  challenge  for  industry,  and  with  the  recent  barrage  of
new regulations, industry has voiced that it cannot bear these costs alone. The Na-
tional  Electronics  Product  Stewardship  Initiative  (NEPSI)—a  dialogue  between
stakeholders  convened  by  the  EPA  in  2001  to  devise  a  single  national  solution  to
electronics  take-back  and  recycling  was  brought  to  an  unsuccessful  close  when  par-
ticipants could not reach a consensus on the financing system for e-waste recycling.
The  key  challenge  has  been  that  all  of  the  proposed  industry  funding  schemes
burden  different  manufacturers  unequally,  and  in  every  case  the  burdened  compa-
nies have vigorously opposed the specific scheme that would disadvantage them. In
response  to  the  lack  of  a  national  solution,  many  U.S.  states  have  developed  their
own  systems,  creating  a  regulatory  patchwork.  This  is  in  addition  to  the  emerging
international  patchwork  of  regulations  creating  an  uncertain  regulatory  environ-
ment  making  it  difficult  for  the  industrial  sector  to  continue  to  innovate  in  a  clear
direction.

These  are  all  overlying  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  to  ensure  the  ultimate

effectiveness of any proposal.

Conclusion

This bill provides a tremendous opportunity to address the important and growing
issue of the impacts of electronics on our environment, our health, and our economy.
It is essential that the legislation incorporate the following elements.

1. Do not focus merely on waste since the only effective and economically bene-
ficial  way  to  address  the  issue  is  through  redesign  of  the  life  cycle  of  elec-
tronics.

2. Funding for research is essential on the green chemistry and green engineer-
ing  solutions  for  the  sustainable  design  of  electronics.  Initially  this  research
will focus on removing some of the most problematic toxic, bio-accumulating,
persistent  substances  and  later  can  address  the  key  systems  approaches  of
biomimicry, organic energy storage, and dematerialization all fundamental to
a sustainable ICT enterprise.

STATEMENT OF MR. PHILLIP J. BOND, PRESIDENT,

TECHAMERICA

Mr. BOND. Thank you, Mr. Chair and Members of the Committee
and  the  staff  for  inviting  us  here  today  for  an  important  hearing.
I  also  want  to  commend  the  Committee  for  a  hearing  that  it  held
April 30 of last year on e-scrap and would commend to you the tes-
timony of HP, which gave, I think, relevant testimony at that. I am
here  on  behalf  of  TechAmerica,  and  you  may  not  know
TechAmerica  but  you  know  who  we  are.  It  is  a  result  of  a  merger
of  AEA,  the  American  Electronics  Association,  ITAA,  the  Informa-
tion Technology Association of America, and two others, which just
last  night,  with  Mr.  Wu  in  our  presence,  unveiled  the  new  name
of  TechAmerica,  this  merger  of  four  associations  which  touches  al-
most every State capital across the United States as well as offices
here,  Brussels,  and  in  Beijing,  so  really  a  grassroots-to-global  rep-
resentation of the technology industry.

As Mr. Hall said in his opening comments, the technology sector
has  dramatically  overhauled  our  economy.  Even  ten  years  ago  if  I
had  been  here  and  mentioned  companies  like  Google  or  eBay,  that
would  have  drawn  a  blank  from  everyone,  and  yet  today  they  are
ubiquitous  brands.  He  mentioned  the  ENIAC  computer,  which
filled  a  room,  and  today  we  wear  on  our  hips  more  computing
power  than  that  had.  Technology  has  also  become  a  fundamental
enabler,  not  just  in  the  economy  and  innovation  but  in  the  energy
and  environmental  challenges  facing  us  today.  The  industry  is

helping to lead the way in producing new and sustainable contribu-
tions.  For  instance,  electric  motors  that  use  variable  speed  drives
happen  to  be  powered  by  chips  from  companies  like  Texas  Instru-
ments  and  they  are  estimated  to  annually  prevent  emissions  of  68
million tons of greenhouse gases. Recently a study by the American
Council for an Energy Efficient Economy concluded that electronics
and  widespread  IT  had  been  among  the  principal  drivers  of  in-
creased  energy  productivity  over  the  last  15  to  20  years,  and  now
the transition to energy independence will also include a reliability
upon more of these devices critical to the functioning of energy sys-
tems,  electric  cars,  and  a  smart  grid.  For  instance,  computer  chips
are being developed by National Semiconductor to improve the con-
version  efficiency  for  photovoltaic  solar  power,  smart  grid  tech-
nologies  that  allow  two-way  communications  and  thus  less  energy
burned in the home or business. Migration to new computing mod-
els—you have heard of cloud computing—will result in a lower soci-
etal  energy  use  for  computing.  Our  industry  has  been  a  part  of
these,  helping  to  drive  them,  and  looks  forward  to  contributing  in-
novation  and  advances  in  this  area  as  well.  Now,  as  we  have  gone
about  this,  as  the  Committee  recognizes,  there  has  been  a  byprod-
uct  of  the  industry’s  growth  in  terms  of  e-scrap  or  e-waste  and  we
are  actively  working  in  that  arena  as  well.  Dr.  Thomas  has  ref-
erenced  the  work  going  on  to  remove  substances  such  as  lead  and
mercury from designs. HP, Apple, and Dell, among others, have in-
troduced  notebook  computers  that  use  LED  technology  instead  of
mercury-containing fluorescent lamps, and such innovations, which
continue nonstop, are notably and importantly almost always done
in  conjunction  with  our  higher  education  system.  The  legislation
being  proposed  by  Chair  Gordon  recognizes  that,  embraces  that,
and  in  our  view,  goes  a  long  way  toward  helping  enable  some  real
solutions, first by authorizing the National Academy of Sciences re-
port,  because  we  have  got  to  get  the  science  right;  secondly,  by
funding  R&D  for  green  alternatives;  and  finally,  requiring  work
with  universities  to  improve  the  training  of  undergraduate  and
graduate  students,  and  I  just  want  to  endorse  what  Dr.  Thomas
said  earlier:  what  a  great  magnet  this  particular  area  can  be  for
a  new  generation  of  students.  I  believe  the  key  will  be  the  ability
of  the  private  sector  to  work  with  the  leading  universities.  Merely
funding  the  research  is  not  enough.  We  need  to  make  sure  it  pro-
vides concrete, implementable solutions that the private sector can
use.

There  are  specifics  in  the  bill  requiring  academic  institutions  to
partner  with  companies  to  include  participation  by  industry  in  the
reviewing body that will evaluate proposals to ensure that they are
practical.  Applications  must  reference  the  companies  and  associa-
tions  that  contribute  to  a  project.  We  think  that  collaboration  is
critical,  and  the  application  must  include  important  transfer  re-
search  results,  again,  making  it  relevant  to  the  real  world,  which
we think is so critical.

We  stand  ready  to  be  of  an  assist  to  the  Committee  and  the
Members  in  any  way  that  we  can,  believing  that  more  innovation
is  going  to  be  part  of  the  solution  going  forward.  Thank  you,  Mr.
Chair.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PHILLIP J. BOND

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  good  morning.  My  name  is  Phil
Bond and I am the President of TechAmerica. Thank you for this opportunity to tes-
tify  today  in  support  of  legislation  that  would  authorize  federal  programs  to  study
and  conduct  research  on  ways  to  reduce  the  environmental  impacts  posed  by  dis-
carded electronic products.

Many of you may not know TechAmerica, but you know who we are. TechAmerica
was  launched  as  a  result  of  the  mergers  of  AeA,  the  Information  Technology  Asso-
ciation  of  America,  the  Cyber  Security  Industry  Alliance  (CSIA),  the  Information
Technology Association of America (ITAA), and the Government Electronics & Infor-
mation Association (GEIA). TechAmerica is the leading voice for the U.S. technology
industry, which is the driving force behind productivity growth and jobs creation in
the  United  States  and  the  foundation  of  the  global  innovation  economy.  Rep-
resenting  approximately  1,500  member  companies  of  all  sizes  from  the  public  and
commercial sectors of the economy, it is the industry’s largest advocacy organization.
It  offers  the  technology  industry’s  only  grassroots-to-global  network,  with  offices  in
State  capitals  around  the  United  States,  Washington,  D.C.,  Europe  (Brussels)  and
Asia (Beijing).

For the last few decades, the high tech industry has produced innovative and rev-
olutionary  products  that  have  powered  the  U.S.  economy  and  dramatically  changed
the way Americans live, work, and play. Just think, in 1996 if I had testified before
this committee, names like Google and Oracle would mean very little to you. Today,
they  are  two  of  the  most  well  known  brands  around  and  their  innovations  have
changed the way Americans and business do pretty much everything. Over the last
25 years we have moved from Commodore 64s to Portable hand-held computers with
exponentially  more  ability;  we  have  gone  from  portable  phones  carried  in  suitcases
to  portable  phones  smaller  than  your  hand;  from  giant  jukeboxes  and  walkmans  to
iPods;  from  green  screens  to  hi-definition;  from  copper  phone  service  to  massive
high-speed networks.

More  than  improved  technologies,  technology  has  become  a  fundamental  enabler,
driving  productivity  and  growth  across  every  economic  sector,  from  farmers  using
GPS  to  improve  their  crop  yields  to  manufacturers  using  computer  assisted  design
and  manufacturing  tools  to  improve  productivity  on  the  factory  floor.  Technology
provides  innovators  with  improved  tools  to  help  them  do  whatever  they  are  doing
in ways that were unimaginable only a few years ago.

The industry is now stepping up to lead the way in inventing and producing new
technologies  to  make  the  economy  more  energy  efficient  and  sustainable.  Electric
motors  that  use  variable  speed  drives,  powered  by  chips  produced  by  companies
such as Texas Instruments, are estimated to annually prevent the emissions of 68n
million tons of greenhouse gases.1

A  recent  study  conducted  by  the  American  Council  for  an  Energy  Efficient  Econ-
omy  for  AeA  found  that  high  tech  electronics  and  the  widespread  advancement  of
information  and  communications  technologies  have  been  among  the  principal  driv-
ers  of  increased  energy  productivity  during  the  past  15–20  years.2 These  techno-
logical  drivers  of  energy  efficiency  span  the  range  from  computers  and  cell  phones
to  numerous  types  of  sensors,  microprocessors  and  other  technologies  embedded  in
every  day  products  such  as  cars,  lighting  systems,  motors  and  appliances.  The  re-
port  states  that  the  continued  development  and  expanded  application  of  such  tech-
nologies  will  help  ensure  that  economic  development  continues  to  move  in  a  direc-
tion that is both economically dynamic and environmentally sustainable.

The transition to energy independence in the United States will also depend upon
the  growth  and  proliferation  of  electronic  devices,  which  are  critical  to  the  func-
tioning  of  renewable  energy  systems,  electric  cars,  and  the  ‘‘smart  grid.’’  Electronic
circuitry is essential to the efficient functioning of hybrid cars just as semiconductor
advances  will  be  critical  to  expanding  the  consumer  utility  and  acceptance  of  plug-
in  electric  vehicles  by  substantially  extending  their  range  and  performance.  Com-

Other  recent  reports  highlight  the  positive  contribution  that  information  technology  can  make
in  improving  the  overall  efficiency  of  the  economy  and  combating  climate  change.  See,  e.g.,

puter chips are being developed by National Semiconductor that improve the conver-
sion  efficiency  of  renewable  energy  sources  such  as  photovoltaic  solar  power,  in-
creasing the cost-effectiveness and long-term sustainability of these installations.

Smart grid technologies will allow two-way communication between the home and
our energy utilities that, when combined with networked home and electronic prod-
ucts  and  appliances,  will  lower  energy  usage  by  all  Americans.  This  collaboration
between  our  network  providers,  electric  companies,  hardware  manufacturers,  net-
work  equipment  manufacturers  and  consumer  electronics  and  appliance  companies
represents  a  who’s-who  of  TechAmerica’s  membership  of  1,500  companies—too  nu-
merous  to  list  them  all  here.  The  Smart  Grid  will  incentivize  the  production  of  en-
ergy-efficient and intelligent appliances, smart meters, new sensing and communica-
tions capabilities, and electric powered passenger vehicles—all of which will be pro-
duced by, or made possible by TechAmerica’s member companies.

The migration to new computing models, such as cloud computing, will bring new
economies  of  scale  resulting  from  shared  data  storage  and  processing  capabilities.
The  result  will  be  significant  decreases  in  societal  energy  usage  while  at  the  same
time  increasing  our  overall  computing  power.  Such  innovations  in  the  high  tech  in-
dustry  will  allow  greater  energy  productivity  throughout  the  economy  without  any
sacrifices in quality of life.

Our industry is also uniquely poised to create ‘‘green jobs’’ that will employ Amer-
icans  and  provide  very  good  wages.  One  ‘‘career  of  the  future’’  that  will  grow  from
new  models  of  computing  is  an  energy  management  coordinator,  who  would  ensure
that  innovative,  high-tech  products  are  programmed  and  operating  at  levels  that
provide the most energy efficient result. TechAmerica’s members are driving innova-
tion in this sector.

Clearly,  the  technology  industry  will  continue  to  play  a  critical  and  leading  role
in enabling energy efficiency and renewable energy. However, as the Committee rec-
ognizes,  a  by-product  of  the  industry’s  growth  has  been  an  increase  in  the  number
of  discarded,  obsolete  electronic  products  that  require  management.  The  United
States  Environmental  Protection  Agency  has  estimated  that  the  electronic  waste
stream  is  growing  2–3  times  faster  than  any  other  waste  stream  in  the  United
States.3 Clearly, something must be done.

The high-tech industry has been actively working to address this issue. Our great-
est  strength  is  the  ability  to  innovate  and  create  products.  Designing  for  the  envi-
ronment has become an integral strategy in most companies’ design and engineering
efforts. Additionally, electronic products are fundamentally unique: In every product
cycle,  they  become  smaller,  faster,  more  functional,  and  more  energy-efficient.  That
phenomenon alone delivers significant benefits for the environment.

Furthermore,  engineers  are  working  to  remove  hazardous  substances,  such  as
lead and mercury, from product designs. These materials often provide unique bene-
fits  and  functionality,  including  safety  shielding  and  energy  efficiency.  Companies
are  developing  substitute  materials  that  can  achieve  the  same  functionality  with
fewer  environmental  impacts.  For  example,  HP,  Apple  and  Dell,  amongst  others,
have introduced several notebook computer models that use LED technology instead
of  mercury-containing  fluorescent  lamps.  Others  are  exploring  the  use  of  halogen
free flame retardants in electronic products.

Products  are  becoming  more  recyclable.  New  techniques  allow  for  easy  and  quick
disassembly.  Companies  are  exploring  the  use  of  plastic  resins  that  can  be  reused
in new products. They are also working with recyclers to help understand how prod-
uct design impacts the recycling process. All of these efforts will help facilitate and
promote more cost effective and efficient recycling operations for electronic products.
It’s  important  to  emphasize  that  our  industry  is  a  partner  in  this  endeavor.  One
of  the  hallmarks  of  America’s  leadership  in  the  global  economy  is  collaboration  be-
tween  universities,  private  laboratories,  government  agencies  and  companies.  To-
gether  we  create  innovative  and  marketable  solutions  in  areas  like  defense,  health
care,  the  hard  sciences  and,  of  course,  technology.  Greening  our  products  and  solv-
ing the e-waste problem is no different—if all these communities can work together
in  committing  resources  to  research  and  development  of  e-waste  solutions,  we  will
be  able  to  tackle  this  problem  without  harming  the  industry’s  greatest  strength—
its ability to innovate.

The  legislation  being  proposed  by  Chairman  Gordon  and  before  this  committee
today will go a long way towards reaching this goal. First, by authorizing a National
Academy  of  Sciences  report  that  will  assess  the  environmental  impacts  caused  by

3 See  http://www.epa.gov/NE/solidwaste/electronic/index.html.  (‘‘While  various  reports  esti-
mate that electronic waste is less than four percent of the total solid waste stream in the United
States  (eCycling  FAQs),  electronic  waste  is  growing  2–3  times  faster  than  any  other  waste
stream (i.e., paper, yard waste.’’)

the  disposal  of  electronic  products,  the  legislation  will  help  fill  a  critical  data  gap
that currently exists. It is important to understand the problem before effective poli-
cies  can  be  constructed.  Second,  by  funding  the  research  and  development  of  green
alternatives  to  hazardous  materials  in  electronics  as  well  as  research  into  product
design to facilitate the disassembly and recycling of electronic waste, the legislation
will address two of the most important challenges the technology industry is seeking
to  overcome:  the  development  of  ‘‘greener’’  products  that  are  easier  to  recycle.  Fi-
nally,  by  working  with  universities  to  improve  the  training  of  undergraduate  and
graduate engineering students in environmental considerations—the legislation will
guarantee  that  future  products  will  be  designed  with  environmental  considerations
as priority design characteristics as opposed to being considered only when the prod-
ucts are discarded.

The  key  to  this  research  and  development  being  successful  will  be  the  ability  for
universities,  labs  and  not-for-profit  organizations  to  partner  with  the  high  tech  in-
dustry in developing workable, efficient, and cost-effective solutions. Merely funding
the  research  is  not  enough—ensuring  that  the  research  provides  concrete  and
implementable  solutions  for  the  private  sector  will  lessen,  if  not  end,  the  environ-
mental issues posed by the disposal of electronic products.

The  current  draft  of  the  bill  contains  several  important  provisions  that  I  believe
will  enhance  public-private  collaboration  and  ensure  that  the  outcomes  envisioned
in  the  bill  lead  to  concrete,  beneficial  innovations  that  improve  the  environmental
profile of high tech products. We congratulate the Chairman for his foresight in in-
cluding  these  provisions,  and  we  urge  that  these  principles  be  retained  and
strengthened in the bill.

Specifically:

• Section  4  calls  for  the  academic  institutions  to  partner  with  companies  and
associations involved in the production, sale, and recycling of electronic prod-
ucts. Requiring the research institutions to partner with companies and asso-
ciations will improve the likelihood that the research projects will yield bene-
ficial results.
• Similarly,  Section  4(b)  calls  for  industry  participation  in  the  reviewing  body
that will evaluate proposals and ensure they have merit. Once again, the ex-
plicit  call  for  industry  participation  in  the  review  of  proposals  will  improve
the prospects for projects that provide practical information to the companies
that produce these products.
• Section  4(d)(1)  states  that  the  application  must  reference  the  companies  and
associations contributing to the project. We believe that requiring evidence of
this  type  of  collaboration  and  support  is  an  essential  element  of  successful
partnership between universities, labs, not-for-profits and industry.
• Section  4(d)(3)  specifies  the  application  must  include  information  on  how  the
Centers  for  Electronic  Waste  Research  will  ‘‘transfer  research  results  into
practice to address the electronic waste issue, with emphasis on the feasibility
of  incorporating  research  results  into  industry  practice.’’  Making  applicants
expressly  identify  how  the  results  will  be  transferred  into  practical  outcomes
in another important element of ensuring successful outcomes.
• Section  4(e)(6)  requires  that  the  evaluation  of  proposals  consider  the  tech-
nology  transfer  plan  and  the  feasibility  of  integrating  the  research  into  prac-
tice.

We  believe  that  these  provisions  will  further  the  goal  of  ensuring  that  the  aca-
demic  research  will  be  meaningful  and  transferred  into  tangible  improvements  in
the  design,  production  and  recycling  of  electronic  products.  This  approach  will  im-
prove  the  prospects  for  promoting  research  that  is  applied  by  companies  and  ulti-
mately achieves the environmental benefits that are the goals of this bill.

Again,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today.  I  look  forward  to  working

with the Chairman and this committee on passage of this legislation.

Chair GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Bond. I think we look forward to

being a partner with you. You will be a great resource.

And now Mr. Jeff Omelchuck.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  JEFF  OMELCHUCK,  EXECUTIVE  DIREC-
TOR,  GREEN  ELECTRONICS  COUNCIL,  ELECTRONIC  PROD-
UCT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT TOOL (EPEAT)
Mr.  OMELCHUCK.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair.  Thank  you  for  holding
this hearing on this important issue and for providing all of us the
opportunity to testify today. My name is Jeff Omelchuck. I am the
Executive  Director  of  the  Green  Electronics  Council,  a  nonprofit
based in Portland, Oregon that works cooperatively with all stake-
holders  interested  in  electronics  and  the  environment  from  manu-
facturers  to  NGOs  to  the  purchasers  and  users  of  electronics  and
recyclers to try to realize the benefits of electronic products without
saddling society with some of the negative aspects of it today. I am
also the Executive Director of EPEAT (Electronic Product Environ-
mental  Assessment  Tool)  Inc.,  which  Congressman  Wu  introduced,
and thank you very much.

I  wanted  to  highlight  a  few  of  the  key  issues  that  I  think  are
emerging  that  make  electronics  rather  unique  products,  that  one,
I think it is just striking that every advance we have made in soci-
ety,  nearly  every  advance  in  the  last  50  years  has  been  enabled
largely by information technologies. At the same time, they are the
most  impactful  product  on  the  planet  to  manufacture.  This  is  a
striking  kind  of  situation  for  a  technology.  Recent  research  indi-
cates  that  probably  about  80  percent  of  the  environmental  impact
associated with desktop computers happens during the material ex-
traction  and  manufacturing  phase.  Most  of  this  impact  occurs  be-
cause of the chemicals and energy and water used in the manufac-

37

ture of the product. The point is that these indirect materials can’t
be recovered during manufacturing because they are not present in
the  product.  I  think  this  argues  for  strong  consideration  of  a  pro-
gram  that  emphasizes  reuse  of  these  products  and  trying  to  do
what we can to extend the life of these products as long as possible
to  amortize  this  impact  of  manufacture  of  a  longer  use  life.  So  if
e-waste only deals with the waste end as it typically has in Europe,
I  think  we  are  missing  a  huge  opportunity  to  reduce  the  environ-
mental impact of these products.

Electronics  are  different  from  many  other  commodities  that  we
think  about  recycling.  If  you  think  of  beverage  containers  or  other
things,  the  goal  of  recycling  those  is  to  recover  the  material  out  of
those  so  we  can  reuse  that  material  and  recover  the  aluminum  or
recover  the  plastic  for  reuse.  The  issue  with  electronics  is  rather
different.  I  think  our  highest  priority  needs  to  be  to  prevent  inap-
propriate recycling, as Dr. Anastas described and Chair Gordon de-
scribed. A lot of this material is shipped overseas where they make
crude  attempts  to  recover  the  expensive  and  valuable  parts  out  of
it  and  their  attempts  have  grave  environmental  issues  associated
with them. We need to prevent the export of our own waste where
it causes these problems. Secondly, as a secondary priority, I think
we need to keep toxics out of the environment. We need to prevent
the pollution caused by e-waste itself. This is an issue that we don’t
face with, say, aluminum cans or plastic bottles. Third, we need to
recover  the  high  value  and  rare  materials  out  of  electronics.  They
are  available  often  in  quite  trace  quantities  but  they  are  also  very
impactful  materials  too  to  create  and  extract  and  make  available
in  our  society,  so  recovering  those  is  probably  the  highest  priority.
And  finally,  recovering  the  plastics  and  ferrous  metals,  which  is
what  we  do  mostly  today  in  the  small  percentage  that  we  do  recy-
cle. It is probably the lowest priority.

I  would  like  to  further  make  the  point  that,  as  Dr.  Anastas  did,
that e-waste systems are incapable of affecting product design and
the product design greatly impacts the results of how well they are
recycled  but  just  collecting  the  waste  and  recycling  at  the  end  of
the stream does nothing to affect product design, and there are re-
cycling systems, electronics recycling systems, all over the world at
this  point.  None  of  them  affect  product  design.  There  is  no  incen-
tive placed on the manufacturer to change product design to make
them more recyclable. There is, however, an effective way to affect
product design, and that is a green purchasing system, a specifica-
tion  placed  by  the  purchasers  of  the  product  on  green  design,  and
there  is  a  very  powerful  program  in  place  today  called  EPEAT.  It
is a program that my organization manages. It is the program used
by  the  U.S.  Federal  Government  when  they  specify  green  elec-
tronics.  Such  programs  do  have  the  capacity  and  capability  of  af-
fecting product design and doing so effectively today. Today EPEAT
has created over $60 billion market incentive for manufacturers to
design and manufacture greener products.

I  would  like  to  make  one  input  on  the  bill.  The  reason  that  we
do  not  today  have  an  electronics  recycling  program  in  the  United
States  is  because  of  difficulties  with  the  funding  system.  Each
funding  system  that  has  been  proposed  affects  different  kinds  of
manufacturers differently, disadvantages some more disproportion-

38

ately  than  others.  Therefore,  each  possible  funding  solution  is  op-
posed by somebody, and that has prevented us moving forward col-
lectively  to  have  a  system  that  works.  Therefore,  I  suggest  that  in
addition  to  the  research  proposed  in  the  bill  that  we  also  include
policy  and  economic  research  in  trying  to  figure  out  the  funding
system that will enable progress.

Thank you very much for this opportunity to testify.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Omelchuck follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JEFF OMELCHUCK

Recycling the huge amount of legacy electronics that have already been produced
is  a  critical  environmental  issue.  A  good  e-waste  system  would  keep  the  environ-
mentally sensitive materials in electronics out of our landfills, groundwater, and air
and  would  allow  us  to  recover  and  re-use  many  of  the  valuable  materials.  In  addi-
tion,  it  must  prevent  the  export  of  American  e-waste  to  countries  and  places  that
cannot,  or  do  not,  recycle  it  properly.  There  are  many  ways  that  the  development
of  an  effective  national  electronics  system  would  benefit  from  further  research.  We
strongly  support  the  proposed  ‘‘Electronic  Waste  Research  and  Development  Act’’
and the creation of a national e-waste recycling system. Below we present some re-
search and thinking about e-waste recycling and suggest some areas needing further
research.

Research  suggests  that  over  80  percent  of  the  environmental  impacts  associated
with Information and Communications Technology (ICT) occur during the manufac-
ture  of  the  product.1 Much  of  this  impact  stems  from  the  electricity,  fossil  fuels,
chemicals,  and  water  used  to  make  semiconductors,  printed  circuit  boards,  and
other  components.  While  recycling  recovers  some  of  the  material  contained  in  the
product,  none  of  these  indirect  materials  or  energy  can  be  recovered.  This  suggests
that one of the best ways to reduce the environmental impacts associated with elec-
tronics is to amortize the high impact of manufacturing them over a longer use life.
Thus,  it  is  critical  that  an  e-waste  ‘‘recycling  system’’  encourage  product
and component re-use.

While  product  design  clearly  affects  recyclability,  the  reverse  is  not  true.  Elec-
tronic  products  are  not  designed  for  optimal  End-of-Life  (EOL)  outcomes.  Further,
if there were comprehensive Design for EOL (DfEOL) guidelines it is not clear why
manufacturers would follow them. While most recycling systems charge manufactur-
ers a fee based on their market share or ‘‘collection share,’’ 2 it doesn’t make environ-
mental  or  economic  sense  to  actually  return  each  manufacturer’s  products  to  them
or  process  them  separately.  Because  of  this,  individual  manufacturers  have  no  in-
centive  to  make  their  products  more  easily  or  efficiently  recycled.  In  fact,  many  of
the innovations that any one manufacturer might make to improve recyclability (use
of unique materials, novel connectors, disassembly methods, etc.) have the potential
to actually reduce the overall recyclability of the common waste stream. Innovation
by  individual  manufacturers  has  not  and  will  not  improve  product
recyclability.  Collective  collection  and  recycling  argues  for  common  prod-
uct DfEOL standards.

Enforcing  a  common  DfEOL  standard  via  regulation  would  be  very  difficult,  and
once enacted it would be very slow to evolve in this fast-moving industry. However,
electronics  manufacturers  are  very  good  at  listening  to  and  meeting  the  needs  of
their customers. An eco-label or ‘‘green purchasing system’’ that carries sub-
stantial market demand is the most practical and responsive way to imple-
ment  a  common  DfEOL  standard  and  is  a  necessary  component  of  an  e-
waste solution.

With  EPA  and  the  Federal  Government’s  help,  in  two  and  a  half  years  EPEAT
has  become  the  most  influential  green  purchasing  system  for  electronics  on  the
planet.  EPEAT  registration  is  now  required  on  over  $60  billion  of  IT  purchase  con-
tracts from the U.S. Federal Government, the Canadian Federal Government, many
states and provinces, and a growing list of international businesses and public agen-
cies.  EPEAT’s  DfEOL  and  other  criteria  are  clearly  affecting  the  design
practices of IT manufacturers globally.

EPEAT  was  developed  by  and  for  institutional  purchasers—organizations  that
buy computers on purchase contracts. Retail consumers represent approximately 40

have implemented e-waste recycling programs.

percent of the market for laptops, desktops, and monitors yet EPEAT is not known
or  used  by  consumers.  In  addition,  stakeholders  have  begun  the  process  of  devel-
oping  EPEAT  standards  for  other  electronic  product  types  with  substantial  con-
sumer markets. If EPEAT is to be an effective tool for improving the recycling out-
comes for consumer electronics then consumers must place a purchasing preference
on  EPEAT  registered  products,  as  the  U.S.  Government  does. Building consumer
awareness  of  the  importance  of  e-waste  recycling  and  of  buying  products
that are optimized for efficient recycling will require market research and
likely public investment.

Recent  research  conducted  by  GEC  et  al.  and  sponsored  by  EPA3 shows  that  e-
waste  recycling  technologies  and  practices  vary  considerably  within  the  U.S.,  rang-
ing  from  manual  deep  disassembly  and  materials  sorting  to  whole  product  shred-
ding. In addition, it appears that different types of electronic products are more effi-
ciently  recycled  in  different  manners.  Therefore,  the  DfEOL  criteria  may  be  dif-
ferent for different types of products that should be recycled in different ways. Fur-
ther research is needed to refine DfEOL criteria.

The  research  report  also  describes  a  pilot  project  sponsored  by  GEC  and  the  Na-
tional  Center  for  Electronics  Recycling  to  create  a  ‘‘Close  the  Loop  Registry’’  of
recyclability information for many electronic products. Further research and sup-
port for piloting and implementing this DfEOL registry are needed.

Finally,  research  suggests  that  a  significant  amount  of  e-waste  is  caused  by  soft-
ware  driven  hardware  obsolescence.  It  is  clear  that  the  commercial  models  of  both
the  software  and  hardware  industries  have  no  clear  incentive  to  prevent  or  reduce
this.  Further  research  is  needed  to  determine  if  there  are  ways  to  change
software and hardware product design practices, or the commercial incen-
tives  of  these  industries,  to  reduce  material  and  energy  churn  without
damaging the innovation and competitiveness of the industry.

Comments on proposed ‘‘Electronic Waste Research and Development Act’’
The  primary  reason  that  the  U.S.  does  not  have  a  comprehensive  e-waste  recy-
cling  program  is  disagreement  between  manufacturers  as  to  how  such  a  system
would  be  funded.  Each  manufacturer  has  opposed  a  system  whose  funding  would
put  them  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  with  respect  to  their  competitors.  As  a  re-
sult,  each  possible  system  is  opposed  by  one  or  more  powerful  manufacturers  and
the  result  is  no  system.  The  proposed  act  would  do  little  to  solve  this  fundamental
problem. We recommend that the research supported under the act include research
into  possible  funding  models  and  how  to  reduce  or  eliminate  competitive  inequities
that prevent forward motion.

Chair GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Omelchuck. Just collaterally, you
had  mentioned  water  in  the  process,  and  another  major  legislative
effort by this committee is going to be on water, and one of the ele-
ments of that will be research to how to use in closed systems, and
how to use water and reuse water more efficiently.

Now Mr. Cade, you are recognized.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  WILLIE  CADE,  FOUNDER  AND  CHIEF  EX-
ECUTIVE OFFICER, PC REBUILDERS AND RECYCLERS, HOME
OF THE COMPUTERS FOR SCHOOLS PROGRAM
Mr. CADE. Thank you, Mr. Chair. It is an honor to be here today
and  I  particularly  want  to  echo  my  fellows  at  the  table  here  in
terms  of  their  testimony,  so  I  am  going  to  skip  kind  of  quickly  on
to the recommendations that I would have in the legislation.

First of all, in the definitions, I would suggest that there be very
specific  references  to  reuse,  refurbishment,  repair,  remanufac-
turing,  material  recovery,  and  proper  disposal.  I  think  the  current
draft  lacks  some  definition  on  that,  and  my  experience  has  been
when it is enacted into law, if those definitions are not clear, it be-
comes very problematic.

I  would  also  suggest  the  definition  of  ‘‘hazardous’’  and  ‘‘poten-
tially  hazardous.’’  I  think  that  is  one  of  the  issues  that  really  is
hard for us to deal with in this particular situation, and I do want
to  let  people  know  that  using  their  computers  in  the  home  is  not
hazardous. There just is potential for hazard later on.

In  terms  of  section  4,  the  research  and  development,  in  terms  of
part 1—one of the things that we have been doing—I have run the
collection  facility  for  the  city  of  Chicago  on  Goose  Island  and  over
the  last  year  we  cataloged  over  7,000  items  that  people  have
brought  to  us  as  computer  waste,  and  of  those,  3,000  different
model numbers exist with 425 different brands that those are made
up  of.  The  average  age  of  that  equipment  is  10.2  years  old  so  that
is a very important number there to understand, and while we may
want  to  design  better  products  that  are  going  to  be  coming  down
the  road  later,  we  have  a  large  backload,  large  volume  of  equip-
ment  that  we  are  going  to  need  to  deal  with  for  many  years  to
come.  Our  data  suggests  that  the  equipment  is  actually  being
stored  longer  and  longer  now  that  people  are  putting  more  and
more of their valued data on that equipment. The other thing that
I  think  is  very  important  in  this  particular  process  is  that  we  un-
derstand that this is not equipment that is not functional. It is just
a  perception  that  it  doesn’t  work  as  well  as  the  new  equipment,
and one of the things that we are very excited about is using these
older  Pentium  3,  Pentium  4  systems  to  help  homes  monitor  their
energy  use  in  the  new  smart  grid  environment.  We  are  currently
working with the Centers for Neighborhood Technology on creating
a  product  that  will  measure  your  home  energy  use—and  therefore
be able to reduce your consumption.

One  of  the  things  that  we  anticipate  is,  by  the  mere  savings  on
energy  usage  in  a  home,  we  will  be  able  to  finance  the  purchase
of  a  PC  for  low-income  families.  Today  there  is  still  25  percent  of
the households that do not have a computer in them. If we can pro-
vide them with a computer that can help them reduce their energy
consumption,  we  believe  we  can  finance  not  only  the  computer,  a
working  model  that  has  all  the  bells  and  whistles,  but  also  the
Internet connection and still save them dollars and energy on their
home plans.

And I believe that this remaking of the products, the remanufac-
turing, the reuse, the refurbishment of these products will actually
give us the ability to bring home the electronics industry. If you are
competing  merely  on  cost  per  hour  for  production,  we  probably

can’t  compete  with  foreign  competitors  but  if  we  are  competing  on
a  whole  system  of  collection  and  use  and  knowledge  and  under-
standing  of  these  systems  and  to  bring  product  out,  I  believe  we
will  be  able  to  do  a  very,  very  good  job  with  it.  We  are  currently
working  on  a  pilot  project  in  the  city  of  Chicago  where  100,000
homes  will  have  smart  meters,  will  be  able  to  connect  to  these
smart  meters  and  be  able  to  bring  back  information  to  the  home
user.  Reports  show—studies  show—right  now  that  the  home  user
who has that kind of information is saving anywhere from 15 to 30
percent  of  their  home  energy  costs.  Average  home  energy  costs
right  now  are  about  $1,200  a  year.  That  is  a  significant  savings.
Thank you very much, and I will be happy to entertain any ques-

tions.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Cade follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF WILLIE CADE

Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  Congress,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  be  before
you  today  and  testify  on  the  issue  of  Electronic  Waste:  Investing  in  Research  and
Innovation to Reuse, Reduce, and Recycle. I would especially like to thank Congress-
woman  Biggert  for  her  support  of  my  work.  I  have  submitted  my  full  written  testi-
mony to the Committee and I will only summarize my statement at this time.

Fifteen  years  ago  I  began  working  with  discarded  computer  equipment  to  help
bridge the digital divide for at risk students in high school. I was attending a board
meeting  of  LINK  Unlimited  a  not-for-profit  organization  that  supplies  mentors  and
financial  aid  for  capable  students  to  attend  the  best  schools  in  the  City  of  Chicago.
During  the  meeting  I  was  arguing  that  each  student  needed  a  personal  computer
in their home so they could prepare adequately for college. The then Chief Financial
Officer  of  Waste  Management  offered  four  conference  rooms  full  of  equipment  that
they were storing because they didn’t know how to throw it away. So began my ad-
venture  of  computer  refurbishment  and  electronics  recycling.  When  I  walked  into
the  conference  rooms  on  that  cold  February  morning  I  saw  opportunity  not  a  pile
of waste. For me this is e-opportunity not e-waste. With the Chairman’s indulgence
I will continue to use my term e-opportunity not e-waste.

We  quickly  discovered  that  the  single  most  complicated  part  of  computer  refur-
bishment was installing a fresh, reliable, and legal operating system across a broad
spectrum  of  hardware.  We  worked  with  Microsoft  for  seven  years  and  in  2000  the
Microsoft  Authorized  Refurbisher  (MAR)  Program  was  launched.  My  company  was
one  of  the  first  five  organizations  that  Microsoft  authorized  to  reinstall  their  Win-
dows operating system on refurbished computers in the U.S. Since then we have re-
furbished over 40,000 computers for schools, not-for-profits, and in homes of children
at  risk.  We  provide  a  complete  system  (CPU,  monitor,  keyboard,  mouse  and  speak-
ers) with an instruction booklet, free U.S. bases telephone support and a three year
hardware  warranty  for  a  starting  price  of  $150.00.  Our  fist  year  failure  rates  are
less than new equipments first year failure rates.

We reluctantly became involved with equipment that we could not use for our re-
furbishing  because  of  the  demands  of  our  donors.  If  we  wanted  the  good  stuff  we
had  to  take  the  whole  lot.  While  this  has  significantly  complicated  our  business
model it has also provided us with enormous opportunities. Early in 2000 the extra
equipment  was  relatively  easy  to  deal  with  but  as  more  and  more  equipment  was
brought  out  of  closets  and  store  rooms  the  task  became  more  challenging.  Today  a
significant majority of equipment is not refurbishable for general personal computer
usage.  Recently  a  stakeholder  group  supported  by  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protec-
tion  Agency  has  published  ‘‘Responsible  Recycling  (R2)  Best  Management  Practices
for the Electronics Industry.’’ This document is attached at the end of this testimony.
These  practices  specify  the  philosophy  and  practice  that  high  quality  organizations
should  employ.  I  whole  heartily  support  the  implementation  of  these  practices  in
certification  programs  like.  There  is  some  controversy  that  these  practices  do  not
hold organizations like mine to a high enough standard. As a practitioner of the art
of e-opportunity I believe that significant research and development must be carried
out  before  we  can  practically  implement  higher  standards.  This  legislation  is  well
suited to accomplish those goals.

Comments on the draft legislation:
Section 3: Definitions.
1) I  would  suggest  that  the  legislation  include  a  specific  definition  of  ‘‘recycling’’
that  includes  reuse,  refurbishment,  repair,  remanufacturing,  material  recovery,
and  proper  disposal.  I  have  attached  to  my  testimony  a  brief  concept  document
on  ‘‘Strategies  for  Improving  the  Sustainability  of  E-Waste  Management  Sys-
tems’’ that may be useful in defining the above terms.

2) I  would  suggest  that  the  legislation  include  a  definition  of  ‘‘hazardous’’  and  ‘‘po-
tentially hazardous’’ materials. I believe that it is important to assure consumers
they  are  not  overly  exposed  to  environmental  hazards  while  using  a  computer.
It is however important to educate people that improper handling may be harm-
ful to themselves and the environment.

Section  4: Electronic  Waste  Engineering  Research,  Development,  and  Demonstration

Projects.

Part  1) I  believe  that  Radio  Frequency  Identification  (RFID)  should  be  the  major
way  that  efficiency  of  recycling  (in  all  of  its  forms)  be  studied.  For  over  a
year  my  organization  has  cataloged  over  7,000  items  at  the  Computer  Col-
lections facility that we operate for the City of Chicago on Goose Island. We
keep  detailed  data  on  each  item  over  one  pound  that  is  delivered  to  this
permanent collection facility. There are roughly 3,000 different model num-
bers  from  over  425  different  Brands.  The  average  age  of  the  equipment  is
10.2  years  old.  People  travel  on  average  six  miles  to  drop  off  their  equip-
ment.  TVs  average  15.5  years  old  while  Apple  Computers  are  two  to  three
years  older  than  other  brands  of  computers.  CPUs  average  25  pounds  and
monitors  average  35  pounds  while  TVs  average  45  pounds.  Automated
triage  with  the  support  of  RFID  must  be  developed  that  fully  utilize  both
the  carbon  investment  of  the  products  and  increase  the  recovered  value.
(Note:  over  80  percent  of  the  energy  used  in  the  life  cycle  of  a  computer
is used in the making of the product.)

Part 2) Casual reading of the Discussion Draft in this section might lead one to be-
lieve  that  research  should  only  be  done  on  ‘‘e-opportunity’’  only  after  it  has
been  destroyed  and  separated  into  different  commodities.  While  I  concur
that much work still needs to be done on that issue there is a broader area
of  research  that  should  be  identified.  A  significant  majority  of  the  equip-
ment  being  turned  in  by  consumers  and  organizations  is  still  functioning.
Newer  models  may  have  come  on  to  the  markets  that  perform  the  desired
tasks faster and better: triggering the false impression that the older equip-
ment is waste. For instance most of the working CPUs that we receive could
be cost effectively remanufactured into home energy monitoring and control
devices,  thus  allowing  consumers  simple  and  efficient  ways  to  take  advan-
tage  of  Smart  Grid  technology  in  their  homes.  I  believe  that  the  refur-
bishing  and  remanufacturing  of  e-opportunity  will  bring  the  electronics
manufacturing industry back home.

Part  3) The  university  setting  is  well  suited  for  this  kind  of  basic  materials  re-

search. I applaud the Committee for it’s inclusion in this legislation.

Part  4) I  believe  that  it  will  be  at  least  15  years  before  all  of  the  potentially  haz-
ardous  materials  will  be  removed  from  our  electronic  devices.  In  the  mean
time  we  need  to  develop  safe  methods  of  removing  those  materials  both  in
developed  and  underdeveloped  countries.  Many  well  intentioned  environ-
mentalists have suggested that unwanted electronic devices that come from
the US and go to developing countries should be shipped back to us for end-
of-life processing. I would rather see safe portable processes that are appli-
cable in many different environments.

Part 5) Product design is one of the most important issues in transforming e-oppor-
tunity  into  value.  To  that  end  I  currently  teach  a  graduate/undergraduate
‘‘e-opportunity’’  course  at  the  University  of  Illinois  at  Urbana/Champaign.
The  course  is  housed  in  its  industrial  design  department,  the  oldest  such
program  in  the  country.  This  semester  we  are  conducting  a  contest,  open
to  all  students  on  campus,  for  the  most  creative  and  the  most  ‘‘geeky’’  use
of e-opportunity. I would like to invite each and every Member of this com-
mittee to be a judge for this contest on April 21st of this year.

Part  6) We  need  scientifically  sound  tools  that  aid  us  in  assessing  the  environ-
mental  impact  of  e-opportunity  and  manufacturing  in  order  to  make  in-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:25 Jun 30, 2009 Jkt 047543 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\FULL09\021109\47543 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

43

formed decisions about the quality of our processing and balance it against
the  needs  to  be  cost  effective.  I  am  not  suggesting  that  we  diminish  our
goal of 100 percent environmental safety but rather that we use these new
tools  to  expedite  reaching  those  goals.  Again  I  applaud  the  Committee  on
the inclusion of this section of the legislation.

Part  7) We  have  not  come  close  to  exhausting  our  electronic  devices.  All  too  often
our  perception  of  obsolescence  prematurely  retires  our  electronics.  Product
design  that  can  incorporate  repairs,  upgrades,  etc.,  need  to  be  encouraged
and real business cases need to be found to support them.

Part  8) I  believe  that  the  single  biggest  issue  confronting  consumers  and  business
in  recycling  their  equipment  is  the  concern  about  data  security.  People  are
not educated nor can they readily identify a device that has its data erased.
Given  that  the  systems  turned  in  at  our  facility  in  Chicago  are  on  average
10.2  years  old  and  preliminary  research  has  shown  that  people  use  their
computers for about six years they must be storing them for four plus years.
RFID can allow a complete and reliable chain of custody that can generate
better  consumer  acceptance  and  therefore  quicker  equipment  turn  around.
This would be a better utilization of the carbon investment made in our de-
vices.

I also applaud the inclusion of sections 5, 6, and 7.
Please  let  me  reiterate  the  following  point  . . .  this  legislation  will  significantly

contribute to bringing home the electronics manufacturing industry.

BIOGRAPHY FOR WILLIE CADE

Willie  Cade  is  the  founder  and  CEO  of  PC  Rebuilders  &  Recyclers  (PCRR).  He
started the company in 2000 to help underprivileged students get cost effective com-
puters. PCRR has placed over 40,000 refurbished computers in schools, not-for-profit
organizations  and  in  homes  of  at  risk  children.  Mr.  Cade  has  been  at  the  for  front
of  the  computer  reuse  industry  for  the  past  15  years.  In  the  early  years  he  worked
closely with Microsoft to help create what is today’s successful Community Microsoft
Authorized  Refurbisher  (Community  MAR)  program.  He  founded  the  first  ever  re-
furbisher  conference  and  continues  to  organize  them  today.  He  is  active  nationally
and  internationally  creating  best  management  practices  that  help  reduce  the  pos-
sible harm of e-waste. Now Mr. Cade’s expertise is being shared with graduate and
under  graduate  students  at  the  University  of  Illinois  Urbana/Champaign.  Along
with  Wal-Mart  and  Microsoft  he  is  co-sponsoring  an  e-waste  ‘‘new  products’’  com-
petition this spring at the University.

DISCUSSION

Chair  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Cade.  And  we  would  appreciate
your  specific  recommendations  on  definitions  and  we  would  rec-
ommend  again  the  panel  any  other  recommendations  they  might
have  on  our  draft  as  well  as  anyone  in  the  audience  or  watching
or  listening  to  us  on  a  website  now.  This  has  been  a  collaborative
effort to get to the point we are now, but I am sure that as we have
more people thinking and giving input, we can make it even better.
So  at  this  point  we  will  now  have  the  first  round  of  questions,

and the Chair recognizes himself for five minutes.

Mr.  Bond,  you  raised  the  issue  earlier  of  the  collaboration  with
the  private  sector  and  the  universities  and  how  that  is  going  on
now. I know that as this takes place, there is going to be some pro-
prietary research, so is there going to be any kind of special provi-
sions  that  we  need  in  this  bill  that  will  provide  incentives  for  the
public sector and private sector to work together?

Mr.  BOND.  I  think  that  as  a  general  rule,  the  Federal  Govern-
ment’s  role  in  doing  a  lot  of  the  basic  research,  fundamental  re-
search  and  very  often  through  a  grant  structure  where  you  have
a  lead  investigator,  a  lead  at  the  university  who  then  invites  pri-
vate-sector participation at a pretty fundamental level is very good

and it allows for the proprietary innovations that might be built on
top  of  that,  but  I  think  you  will  find  a  ready  and  willing  partner
in the private sector to do some of that fundamental research, new
materials  that  could  be  incorporated  into  design,  better  uses  or
testing  and  research  into  uses  of  new  materials  that  we  haven’t
thought of before, technologies to recover materials. I think the in-
dustry  has  shown  that  it  is  on  the  edge  of  its  seat  and  willing
to——

Chair GORDON. So you don’t think any kind of special provisions

need to be made for proprietary issues?

Mr.  BOND.  Well,  we  have  some  vehicles  in  the  government  al-
ready for cooperative research and development agreements and so
forth  that  take  that  into  account  to  protect  intellectual  property,
but  I  think  there  is  a  great  agreement  that  there  is  a  first  step
where  the  government  should  lead  and  the  private  sector  is  more
than willing to participate.

Chair GORDON. On that topic, I think one of the biggest obstacles
to national e-waste R&D initiative, like many things, is tech trans-
fer  and  getting  it  from  the  academic  research  area  into  industry,
so  I  will  just  ask  Mr.  Bond  if  you  want  to,  or  anybody  else  wants
to,  have  any  comments  on  how  we  can  make  that  transfer  better.
Mr.  BOND.  Just  in  some  very  general  terms,  I  want  to  observe
that  I  think  the  tech  transfer  laws  in  this  country  have  been  one
of  the  great,  great  global  competitive  advantages  we  have  had.  As
we  try  to  maintain  our  global  edge  competitively,  I  think  we  have
to  constantly  look  at  that  because  others—it  is  a  competitive  mar-
ket and other universities based in other countries are trying to at-
tract investment from some of the multinational companies that do
significant research. So I think we want to continue to look at that
and would certainly welcome thoughts from those in the more aca-
demic  side  of  the  equation,  but  I  think  we  need  to  have  a  balance
in this as we do in so many things to make sure that as we divide
the  intellectual  property,  that  it  doesn’t  result  in  a  stalemate  but
it instead results in the tech transfer.

Chair  GORDON.  Well,  let  us  ask  anybody  else  on  the  panel.  Mr.

Mr. CADE. Thank you, Chair. I do teach at the University of Illi-
nois,  Champaign  Urbana,  an  e-waste  sustainable  class,  and  one  of
the—we  are  working  on  those.  Also,  the  University  has  an  inter-
national  component  to  it.  They  have  research  centers  outside  the
United  States.  We  are  finding  that  their  cooperation  with  us  has
been extraordinarily wonderful, and we are actually using students
to  take  this  pile  of  equipment  and  bring  it  back  to  life.  We  have
already discovered just through a few trials some major issues that
we  need  to  input  to  our  friends  over  here  at  EPEAT  (Electronic
Product  Environmental  Assessment  Tool)  in  terms  of  making  this
product more accessible for reuse and refurbishment.

Chair GORDON. Anyone else want to comment?
Dr. ANASTAS. I would just suggest that there are existing models
that have been used in various agencies to address this exact type
of question. When you look at the Technology for Sustainable Envi-
ronment  out  of  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA),  that
has  not  only  brought  about  excellent  industry-university  partner-
ships  but  also  sprouted  quite  a  number  of  new  businesses.  If  you

look at some of the National Science Foundation (NSF) models, the
industry-university  cooperative  research  centers,  the  engineering
research  centers,  and  science  and  technology  centers,  these  ques-
tions  of  tech  transfer  and  intellectual  property  have  been  dealt
with well.

Chair  GORDON.  Mr.  Bond,  I  know  you  would  like  to  speak.  I
would like to get on to one other question before my time runs out,
and maybe you want to help us with that one. The E.U. has taken
more of a regulatory position across the board than we have in this
country,  although  some  states  have.  This  bill  really  is  in  the  re-
search area. But are there any lessons to be learned from what the
E.U.  has  done  that  would  be  pertinent  to  our  bill  in  terms  of  not
regulations, but rather research? Is anyone familiar with what they
are  doing  over  there  or  have  anything  they  want  to  suggest?  Yes,
sir.

Mr.  OMELCHUCK.  Mr.  Chair,  the  E.U.  has  completed  twice  now,
I  believe,  comprehensive  performance  reviews  of  the  e-waste  sys-
tem implemented in Europe. They recently completed, I think very
recently  in  the  last  few  weeks,  completed  a  second  kind  of  com-
prehensive  review  of  the  system  so  that  is  available  to  be  re-
searched.  I  recommend  that  we  look  closely  at  that.  The  other
striking  thing  about  the  E.U.  system,  the  two  things  that  I  would
observe,  are  that  even  though  it  is  a  regulatorily  required  com-
prehensive system, the actual rate of recovery of electronics is sur-
prisingly  low,  in  the  35  percent  range,  which  means  still  65  per-
cent,  even  though  it  is  a  regulatorily  required  system,  still  65  per-
cent of the e-waste is leaving the system inappropriately, is escap-
ing the system, which is a surprising number, I think, for many of
us.

Chair GORDON. Well, that is why Mr. Baird is very interested in
how do we—the psychology aspect of getting folks to work with the
system. My time is running out here, so anybody else want to com-
ment on the lessons from the E.U. Yes, Dr. Thomas.

Dr. THOMAS. One lesson from the E.U. is that there is some kind
of goal set forward by the government, and to move things forward
in the United States, it might not have to be an E.U.-style program
but  some  guidance  to  push  forward  recycling  and  remanufacturing
to  let—because  industry—it  won’t  just  be  one  industry  that  needs
to  work  on  this.  Somehow  there  needs  to  be  integration  between
the  manufacturers  and  the  retailers  and  the  recyclers  and  univer-
sity  researchers  and  EPA  or  some  other  government  agency  could
provide  some  forum  for  making  these  organizations  work  together
productively. That won’t happen in a vacuum.

Chair GORDON. It needs to be good, Mr. Bond, because——
Mr.  BOND.  It  is  going  to  be  short.  I  don’t  know  about  good.  Just
that  there  are  a  full  range  of  stakeholders  that  should  be  a  part
of  that  discussion  and  part  of  that  research,  the  government  and
its procurement rules, just to name one quickly.

Chair GORDON. Thank you.
Dr. Ehlers is recognized.
Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair,  and  first  of  all,  thank  you
for  holding  the  hearing.  This  is  a  very  important  topic.  I  was
watching 60 Minutes a few weeks or months ago and wrote a note
to  myself  that  I  had  to  check  into  this.  They  were  talking  about

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:25 Jun 30, 2009 Jkt 047543 PO 00000 Frm 00049 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\FULL09\021109\47543 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

how  they  had  followed  a  container  of  used  computers,  waste  com-
puters, some of them post recycling, supposedly, and followed it all
the way to China where it was simply burned on a trash heap after
they  had  extracted  some  things.  Everyone  along  the  line  specifi-
cally  violated  the  law  because  they  are  not  allowed  to  do  this.  So
whatever  we  do,  it  has  to  have  teeth  and  it  has  to  have  enforce-
ment.

Secondly,  let  me  say  the  Minority  regards  this  as  a  very  serious
issue  and  would  be  very  happy  to  work  with  you  on  developing  a
really good and strong bill.

I looked at some of the options and you have mentioned some of
the  options.  I  don’t  see  any  reason  we  can’t  do  it.  We  just  have  to
make sure we do it right and we have to make sure we do it fairly,
and any specific suggestions you have along that line would be use-
ful.  But  before  I  go  to  you  and  ask  for  your  comments  on  that,  let
me  just  ask  a  question,  a  generic  question.  What  does  the  U.S.
House of Representatives do with its used computers? When I was
involved in computerizing the House for the first time in 1994 and
1995,  we  decided  that  any  used  computers  from  the  House  would
be  available  for  purchase  by  the  employees,  who  loved  that  and
many  of  them  didn’t  have  good  computers  at  the  time  and  it  got
them  in  the  home  computer  business  and  we  thought  it  was  bene-
ficial to the House too. Later on we were told we were not allowed
to do this because that was somehow giving a bonus to the employ-
ees.  I  didn’t  particularly  worry  about  that  but  it  turns  out  I  don’t
know  whether  it  was  GSA  (General  Services  Administration)  or
what stopped us from doing it. But it has gotten steadily worse. We
then  proceeded  in  our  district  office,  when  we  changed  computers,
and donated them to nonprofit organizations. That lasted two years
and  then  we  were  told  we  couldn’t  do  that  either.  I  think  we  have
to  broaden  our  discussion  to  the  GSA  and  what  they  are  doing
about  this  problem  because  they  have  responsibility  for  a  huge
number  of  computers  nationwide,  and  if  we  can  set  up  a  program
that  works  for  the  GSA,  it  most  likely  will  work  for  the  Nation.
Plus,  I  don’t  think  it  hurts  for  the  government  to  be  first  and  find
out  what  the  burdens  are  on  this  so  that  we  are  not  imposing  un-
usual burdens on the private sector. We can answer their questions
and  say  well,  we  are  doing  it  and  this  is  how  we  are  doing  it  and
it works.

Mr.  BAIRD.  Will  the  gentleman  yield  for  one  second,  Mr.  Ehlers?
Mr. EHLERS. Yes.
Mr.  BAIRD.  I  faced  the  same  problem  in  my  office  this  year,
would  like  to  donate  my  computers  to  the  local  schools,  and  have
been prohibited. Jose Serrano, our colleague, has a bill to allow us
to do just that, and I would encourage all my colleagues to co-spon-
sor  that  bill.  It  is  ludicrous  that  we  can’t  give  our  replaced  com-
puters  to  local  education,  and  I  applaud  the  gentleman  for  his  ini-
tiative.

Mr.  EHLERS.  And  I  would  even  broaden  it  to  other  nonprofit  or-
ganizations. There are a lot of social organizations that could easily
pass  these  on  to  poor  individuals  who  can’t  afford  one.  That  is  my
basic  point.  I  hope  we  can  answer  the  questions  internally  about
what  the  U.S.  House  does,  what  the  GSA  does,  and  change  that.

Back  to—oh,  I  should  mention,  by  the  way,  my  wife  would  be
very  happy  if  we  adopt  a  good  program  because  I  cannot  in  good
conscience  throw  out  a  computer  now.  We  have  seven  or  eight  of
them  in  the  basement  and  the  basement  is  starting  to  overflow
with that and my other junk.

I appreciate any comments you would like to make. Mr. Cade.
Mr.  CADE.  Thank  you.  Just—we  do—we  have  worked  over  the
last  number  of  years  to  try  to  get  Executive  Order  12999  changed
so  that  refurbishers  like  myself  can  take  the  equipment  from  gov-
ernment  agencies  and  distribute  them.  The  issue  really  is  around
software  and  about  the  issue.  In  order  to  securely  give  the  equip-
ment  to  us,  it  needs  to  be—the  hard  drive  needs  to  be  wiped.  It
is  tantamount  to  taking  an  engine  out  of  a  car  and  delivering  the
car  to  someone’s  driveway  and  saying  here,  you  have  got  a  great
product,  have  fun  with  it.  So  we  actually  have  in  the  last  three
Congresses  had  legislation  to  change  Executive  Order  12999  to
allow refurbishers to get the equipment and then pass it on to the
not-for-profits, et cetera, and I will be happy to take the equipment
from your home.

Mr. EHLERS. Yes, Dr. Anastas.
Dr.  ANASTAS.  I  would  just  like  to  comment  on  your  remark  that
we  need  to  do  this  right  and  comment  on  why  it  is  so  important
to have sustainable design frameworks that allow us to do the right
things  right  and  not  the  right  things  wrong.  What  I  mean  by  that
is,  so  often  we  see  good  intentions  for  environmental  and  sustain-
ability  issues  get  it  wrong,  looking  at  our  solar  photovoltaics  that
are using toxic scarce metals, our biofuels that may not be compat-
ible with our land-use policies, our efficient lighting that may intro-
duce  toxins  into  the  environment.  So  how  do  you  ensure  that  you
are  not  going  to  be  doing  the  so-called  right  things  wrong?  And  it
is these design frameworks of understanding that the intrinsic na-
ture  is  of  the  materials  and  energy  flows  that  we  are  using  in  our
electronics,  not  only  what  we  make  but  how  we  make  it,  and  so
that is why I come back to the compass being more important than
the  speedometer  and  knowing  that  when  you  are  trying  to  make
something  green  and  sustainable  that  you  are  actually  heading  in
the right direction.

Mr. EHLERS. A very good comment, and just a quick comment in
response.  Individuals  generally  do  not  look  to  the  future  as  much
as  they  should  and  analyze  what  can  and  should  be  done,  and  yet
you  save  money  by  doing  it.  I  was  struck  this  morning  when  I
heard  the  news  once  again  there  is  a  lot  of  talk  about  the  lead  in
the water in Washington, D.C., and the damage it has done to the
children. Every few years this appears and the problem never gets
solved. Kids continue to drink water with lead in it. And if you just
analyze  the  cost  of  what  that  is  compared  to  fixing  the  problem  in
the  first  place,  I  am  sure  fixing  it  is  infinitesimal  and  I  think  you
will  find  the  same  thing  with  the  computer  situation.  If  you  do  it
right, it is going to cost less in the long run than whatever we are
doing  now  or  whatever  might  happen  if  we  don’t  do  things  right.

With that, I yield back.
Chair  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Ehlers.  My  daughter  has  been
drinking  that  water.  I  am  terrified.  And  we  do  need  to  get  some
answers.

If I could real quickly—as usual, you know, you raised some very
good questions, some of which aren’t particularly in our jurisdiction
but  let  me  try  to  respond.  It  is  my  understanding  that  Mike
Thompson on the House side and Barbara Boxer on the Senate side
are  organizing  a  recycling  effort  and  that  there  will  be  a  time
where we can do that. The second thing is, as the former Chairman
of  the  House  Administration  Committee,  why  don’t  you  and  I  col-
laborate  and  write  a  joint  letter  to  the  Speaker  and  to  Minority
Leader  Boehner  about  those  things  that  it  may  not  be—you  know,
what  we  can  do  administratively,  maybe  not  legislatively  but  ad-
ministratively  and  make  those  recommendations  and  challenge
them to do that? So we will work together on that.

Mr. EHLERS. Thank you very much, and if anyone wants an origi-

nal Mac SE, I have one in my basement.

Chair  GORDON.  Okay.  Ms.  Johnson,  you  have  been  very  patient.

You are recognized for questions.

Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
I  would  like  to  pose  a  question  to  the  panel.  We  have  in  some
of  our  schools  a  program  where  computers  are  rebuilt  by  students
and  they  are  teaching  them  to  do  that.  Do  you  see  any  danger  in
that?  Does  that  have  to  do  with  anything  about  restricting  where
they are circulated?

Mr.  CADE.  The  actual  process  of  the  refurbishment  is  typically
swapping out whole parts so there is typically no danger associated
with  that.  That  is  one  of  the  reasons  I  recommended  earlier  that
we  put  in  the  legislation  a  definition  of  ‘‘hazardous’’  and  ‘‘poten-
tially hazardous.’’ We don’t see any, and we have been audited with
environmental  experts  on  those  issues  when  we  are  refurbishing
computers.  We  are  typically  undoing  screws  or  unplugging  things.
We  are  not  taking  and  grinding  up  the  material  to  that  end,  and
I  am  certain  that  that  is  not  happening  in  the  schools.  So  with  a
high  degree  of  confidence  I  would  say  that  there  is  not  any  in-
creased  exposure  risk  to  the  students  in  that  kind  of  a  program.
Mr. BOND. Congresswoman, if I could add too, the upside of that
is,  a  number  of  programs  around  the  country  have  shown  that  it
serves  to  demystify  the  computer  to  the  kids  and  make  them  that
much more willing to pursue a career in that field.

Ms. JOHNSON. Yes. How can we leverage existing R&D that may

be beneficial to solving the challenge of the e-waste?

Dr.  ANASTAS.  If  I  may,  there  is  a  tremendous  portfolio  of  re-
search  going  on  currently  in  green  nanotechnology,  some  of  the
leading groups out of the University of Oregon. There is wonderful
work  going  on  in  biomimetic  materials.  There  is  wonderful  work
going  on  on  new  types  of  batteries,  energy  storage,  energy  scav-
enging. That type of broad research is being done for a wide range
of  purposes  but  is  directly  relevant  to  the  up-front  design  of  next-
generation  electronics.  By  leveraging  that  existing  research,  there
could be a real multiplier effect on the purposes of this legislation.
Ms. JOHNSON. What is the rationale for exporting it? Is it for dis-

posal or——

Mr. OMELCHUCK. If I may, the rationale is really not—you know,
it  is  not  illegal  or  intentional  activity  by  and  large,  so  it  is  being
exported to these places that you saw in the 60 Minutes documen-
tary.  It  is  at  the  edge  of  legality.  It  is  neither  legal  in  China  nor

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:25 Jun 30, 2009 Jkt 047543 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\FULL09\021109\47543 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

49

is  it  really  legal  in  the  United  States  so  I  think  it  is  hard  to  de-
scribe the rationale. It is being done because it is mildly profitable.

Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much.
Mr.  BOND.  If  I  could,  Congresswoman,  I  would  add  that  at  least
theoretically,  and  I  believe  in  practice,  there  are  examples  too
where  someone  would  refurbish  and  then  export  what  had  been
considered  e-scrap  or  e-waste  to  maybe  a  developing  nation  or
someplace  where  it  would  really  be  of  use,  and  so  you  want  to
make  sure  as  you  think  of  an  international  regime  that  you  don’t
somehow  make  that  illegal  because  it  was  considered  scrap  but  it
has been refurbished and could be put to use in some other setting.
Mr. OMELCHUCK. And I would add to that that the reality is that
all  electronics  today,  or  almost  all,  are  built  in  Asia,  and  if  this  is
where  they  end  up,  there  are  very  legitimate  reasons  to  want  to
send the materials from which they were built back to Asia because
that is where they can be used by and large and so there are legiti-
mate reasons to do it. The challenge is to do it appropriately.

Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much.
Chair GORDON. Thank you, Ms. Johnson.
Ranking Member Hall, do you have any questions?
Mr. HALL. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I was called away to an emer-
gency  meeting  and  I  don’t  know  what  questions  have  been  asked.
I  had  looked  forward  to  hearing  their  testimony,  and  I  will  read  it
at a later time, and I thank you. I won’t waste your time with rep-
etition of questions.

Chair  GORDON.  Thank  you,  sir.  We  will  move  on  then  to  Mr.

Bilbray.

Mr.  BILBRAY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair.  I  think  it  is  important  that
we  come  back  to  certain  terminologies  that  could  be  very,  very
damaging  to  this.  Your  reference  to  the  term  hazardous,  we  have
thrown that around and we like to say that, and the argument, es-
pecially coming from California, is you always want to go to the ex-
treme  of  safety  to  avoid  any  possibility  of  exposure  on  a  lot  of  this
stuff, and in California we have seen what has happened with that.
You  can’t  walk  into  any  store  or  any  hotel  without  a  big  warning
sign,  ‘‘The  carpeting  may  cause  cancer,’’  you  know,  that  basically
people  just  turn  off  and  don’t  read  it.  But  the  definition  of  ‘‘haz-
ardous’’—you  know,  I  served  ten  years  on  hazardous  reviews
boards  and  on  environmental  health  agencies,  and  the  definition
does matter, doesn’t it? It really draws a defined there yet.

Mr.  CADE.  Yes,  and  I  think  it  is  important  to  make  the  distinc-
tion  between  hazardous  material  and  potentially  hazardous,  and
much  of  the  problems  that  you  see  in  informal  recycling  is  the
issues  that  they  bring  up  using  things  like  cyanide,  et  cetera,  so
it is in the processing that those are the real hazards that are com-
ing up or the inappropriate burnings and those kinds of things. So
I  think  that  is  exactly  right,  and  I  would  defer  to  your  experience
in  terms  of  writing  the  legislation  in  terms  of  making  those  kinds
of points. Thank you very much.

Mr.  BILBRAY.  Mr.  Chair,  I  just  want  to  point  that  out  because  it
triggers  certain  processes  and  we  have  to  be  careful,  and  I  just—
not  to  belabor  but  to  give  you  an  example.  We  had  a  great  system
where there was an entrepreneur who went around to all the ship-
yards and all the industrial places and took the sandblasting sand

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:25 Jun 30, 2009 Jkt 047543 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\FULL09\021109\47543 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

50

and used that sandblasting sand in an asphalt mix, in other words,
recycled it, put it into a product, avoided having to go out into the
back  land  and  mine  sand  from  riverbeds  and  stuff,  and  it  was
going  into  an  asphalt  or  concrete  where  it  was  stabilized,  but  be-
cause  the  item  was  a  waste  product,  it  triggered  a  whole  environ-
mental oversight that outlawed his ability to recycle it and it ended
up having to go to facilities to be thrown away rather than reused.
Nobody  meant  that  kind  of  thing  to  happen  so  we  have  got  to  be
careful with our trigger going down. You have a comment?

Dr.  ANASTAS.  I  would  just  say  that  this  speaks  directly  to  the
provisions  in  the  bill  for  the  physical,  chemical  property  database,
that  when  you  are  looking  at  the  substances  in  this  determination
of hazardous or potentially hazardous, you are looking at what are
the  intrinsic  physical  properties,  chemical  properties  that  allow
something  to  be  hazardous,  allow  it  to  be  bioavailable,  and  those
intrinsic  properties  are  so  essential  in  this  database  because  sepa-
rating  the  intrinsic  nature  of  these  substances  from  the  cir-
cumstances,  those  about  whether  or  not  people  are  going  to  be  ex-
posed,  is  the  difference  between  hazardous  and  potentially  haz-
ardous.  So  I  think  the  provisions  for  physical-chemical  property
database is well founded.

Mr.  BOND.  Just  real  quickly,  underscoring  the  Chair  saying  we
have to get this right, it is further complicated by needing to weigh
other  societal  benefits,  so  originally  in  laptops  we  went  to  fluores-
cent  lamps  because  it  was  going  to  decrease  the  amount  of  energy
used,  but  then  there  are  problems  with  fluorescent  lamps  because
they  have  mercury,  so  would  you  have  not  wanted  that  societal
goal met for this one? Now, thankfully, we are moving to LED tech-
nologies,  which  are  going  to  be  the  next  innovation  and  we  will
avoid a problem. As the design for environment improves, the need
for regulation hopefully will go down.

Mr.  BILBRAY.  And  the  issue  of  exportation,  exporting  the  mate-
rial,  the  waste  product,  it  is  universal  in  recycling  and  maybe  one
of  the  things  we  need  to  talk  about  is  why  we  don’t  make  it  legal
to do more reprocessing within the boundaries of the United States
because  I  don’t  care  if  it  is  cardboard  or  if  it  is  e-waste,  the  rule
is  ship  it  thousands  of  miles  away,  they  will  recycle  it,  come  back
out,  increase  the  carbon  footprint  and  it  becomes  a  real  problem
there. I think one of the answers, and I am glad to see that Mem-
ber Baird is interested in this too, is this issue of the Federal Gov-
ernment looking at purchases of materials and designing the e-ma-
terial  from  the  beginning  to  be  recyclable  so  that  you  not  only
eliminate the waste problem but you provide a long-term source of
material  for  the  next  generation  so  that  now  you  have  engineered
something  to  where  you  build  it  with  materials  that  then  can  be
taken and used as a natural resource or a recycled resource for the
next generation. There is a sustainable economic base, and I think
I  am  very  excited  with  that,  and  that  is,  Mr.  Chair,  where  we  get
into an issue that in the air strategy we always call the technology
forcing  regulation,  and  one  way  to  do  that  would  be  for  us  within
our  own  purchasing  and  procurement,  and  as  Ranking  Member  on
Procurement and Government Oversight, I would like to work with
this committee at moving that item one step further and setting an
example for the next generation of e-recycling and that is basically

using  it  as  the  mainstream,  not  as  a  subsidiary  of  the  source  for
material. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.

should  be  rewarded,  and  we  will  get  to  you  right  after  Mr.  Baird.
Mr.  BAIRD.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair.  First,  I  want  to  applaud  you,
Mr. Chair, for taking the initiative that Mr. Ehlers raised. It is tre-
mendously  frustrating,  we  are  mandated  to  replace  our  computers
because  they  fall  out  of  currency  with  the  current  operating  sys-
tems and then we see local schools in our district and we can’t give
our  computers  to  them.  Instead,  we  have  to  transfer  them  and  get
them  scrubbed.  It  is  crazy.  And  anything  you  can  do  to  fix  that
would benefit our kids and make a lot more sense.

I want to ask a few questions. My district has made a real effort
on  e-waste  recycling  but  I  would  like  to  know  something  about
what  are  the  best  practices  and  what  do  we  know  actually  works.
Let me—I do a lot of work on my own computers at home, and just
uninstalling  a  single  program  is  frankly  a  pain  oftentimes.  Are
there industries—so what are my obstacles, and I am a pretty envi-
ronmentally  responsible  person.  What  are  my  obstacles?  One  is,  it
is  fairly  complicated  to  uninstall.  Secondly,  you  just  don’t  know
what  to  do  with  the  waste.  You  sit  there  with  batteries  or  an  old
cell  phone,  or  I  don’t  know  how  many  old  chargers  I  have  sitting
around  that  I  don’t  even  know  what  they  go  to.  There  is  copper  in
there  and  that  is  useful  and  a  valuable  material  but  I  don’t  know
what  to  do  with  it.  So  we  have  seen  in  other  areas  that  the  com-
puter  industry  has  done  things  to  establish  standardization.  The
USB  port  is  an  example.  I  mean,  there  are  hundreds.  They  have
these whole networks of people that work together. Are they doing
anything  to  come  up  with  standard  procedures  or  mechanisms  to
facilitate  this?  For  example,  a  well-hidden  complete  delete  button
that  deletes  every—you  know,  that  auto-scrubs  your  entire  com-
puter  for  when  the  time  comes  to  put  it  away,  standard  mecha-
nisms by which you could extract transformers or copper, et cetera.
What  is  being  done  in  that  realm  and  what  are  the  best  practices
to help public citizens respond?

Mr. CADE. Mr. Baird, we actually have built into our refurbished
computers  the  ability  to  do  exactly  what  you  are  talking  about,  a
one-button,  well-hidden  erase.  We  did  it  because  we  provide  our
equipment  across  the  United  States  and  we  provide  800-number
support  based  in  the  United  States  for  that  equipment,  and  what
we  found  is,  approximately  80  percent  of  our  errors  that  our  users
have are software related, not hardware. They will call me up and
say  my  computer  doesn’t  work  and  so  after  a  few  minutes  I  will
go  through  and  I  go,  if  you  are  willing  to  lose  everything  on  your
computer,  then  fine,  I  will  reset  that  back  to  factory  settings  for
you, and so you are absolutely right. We need to develop those. And
our process takes about 20 minutes in order to completely reset the
data.  Unfortunately,  what  it  doesn’t  do,  it  doesn’t—because  of  the
nature  of  the  way  software  has  been  designed,  it  doesn’t  erase  the
information,  it  just  loses  the  ability  to  find  it.  And  so  I  agree  with
you  totally  that  we  need  to  have  or  some  way  encourage,  particu-
larly  hard  disc  manufacturers  or  any  storage  devices  a  one-button,
let us erase it all and know that that is done.

I looked into my drawer before I came today and I have approxi-
mately  17  different  USB  drives  with  storage.  I  have  no  idea  what
is on any of them. I took a magnet and tried to degauss them. They
don’t  degauss.  I  also,  by  the  way,  put  it  through  a  washing  ma-
chine because it was left in my pants. The thing still works. So we
have  gotten  lots  of  equipment  out  there,  and  if  you  look  at  the
NIST  [National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology]  special  re-
port 80088 on erasing information, it is a much bigger problem and
especially  since—I  mean,  I  am  personally  concerned  about  it  be-
cause  I  do  my  tax  returns  myself  on  my  computer.  I  don’t  want  to
change  them  out.  And  I  understand.  I  think,  by  the  way,  that  is
the  fundamental  problem  with  e-waste  right  now  is  people  just
don’t  have  confidence  in  understanding  how  to  get  rid  of  the—and
they need to rely on people like me.

Mr.  BAIRD.  And  you  don’t  want  to  take  the  time.  I  have  got  sev-
eral  old  Mac  laptops  sitting  around.  I  don’t  know  what  is  on  them
but I don’t want somebody else to find out what is on them.

Mr. CADE. Well, and that is why it is so important, the work that
we are doing with Dr. Thomas on RFID (radio frequency identifica-
tion), individual identification of product, because that will give us
a verifiable custody history that we can work on, and it is the kind
of  thing  that  we  need  to  develop,  and  just  back  to  Representative
Johnson’s point about the nature of this legislation. It has require-
ments  in  it  that  it  is  multi-departmental  in  terms  of  working  on
these  research  centers.  That  is  an  absolute  must  in  my  mind,  ev-
erywhere from the art and design and industrial design product all
the  way  through  to  the  chemist  and  all  the  products  that  they  are
working with.

Mr. OMELCHUCK. I would like to respond also. I think, Represent-
ative  Baird,  your  first  premise  was  that  the  House  needs  to  obso-
lete  our  computers  at  a  pretty  rapid  rate  because  they  are  no
longer compatible with the new operating systems, and I think that
is  an  assumption  that  we  as  the  society  need  to  look  at  pretty
closely.

Mr. BAIRD. I agree. I didn’t want to do this. The former computer
worked  just  fine.  It  now  crashes  with  regularity.  So  I  paid  more
money to get a system that works less well and then I can’t recycle
or reuse my prior system. That is pretty stupid.

Mr.  OMELCHUCK.  Right.  So  I  think  that  is  really  a  fundamental
issue that—and it was part of my testimony to encourage research
in  the  amount  of  e-waste,  hardware  waste  caused  actually  by  soft-
ware  obsolescence  and  of  course  I  think  we  all  recognize  that  that
is  a  very  challenging  problem  to  address  with  the  hardware-soft-
ware  industry.  That  scares  the  bejeebers  out  of  them  to  have  us
looking at that, but I think it is something that needs to be looked
at in the light of day and thought about.

The other comment I wanted to make is, you talked about design
for end-of-life and how we design these products for end-of-life, and
I  just  wanted  to  return  to  the  point  that  e-waste  doesn’t  do  that.
However,  there  are  developing  research  programs  around  design
for  end-of-life  on  electronic  products.  In  fact,  EPEAT,  the  system
we  operate,  has  probably  the  best  criteria  of  any  eco  label  around
designed  for  end-of-life  and  to  be  candid,  it  needs  more  research.
We  don’t  really  quite  yet  understand  how  design  affects  end-of-life

scenarios and the challenge in the United States is that the actual
process used to recycle electronics is all over the map, from a room
full  of  guys  with  hammers  to  very  sophisticated  processes  and  so
what—how  do  you  design  a  product  to  be  recovered  efficiently  in
each  of  these  scenarios.  That  is  an  area  for  further  research  that
I think this bill could support.

Chair  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Baird.  As  usual,  you  hit  a  hot

button, and Mr. Smith, you are recognized.

Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
First, a couple questions for Dr. Thomas. In light of the fact that
I think many recycling efforts are cost effective both long-term and
short-term,  both  directly  and  indirectly,  and  when  you  mentioned
that  approximately  18  percent  of  electronics  are  being  recycled
right now, does that mean the first user is not the last user or does
that mean like the second user might be the last user as well?

Dr.  THOMAS.  That  18  percent  is  an  estimate  made  by  the  U.S.

EPA and that includes in that number both reuse and recycling.

Mr. SMITH. Okay, so——
Dr.  THOMAS.  It  is  kind  of  an  upper  limit  number.  The  actual

number is less.

Mr. SMITH. In that 18 percent, that might also——
Dr. THOMAS. That includes reuse.
Mr.  SMITH.  Okay.  Thank  you  very  much.  And  then  furthermore,
we know that there are certainly energy costs associated with some
recycling  efforts  and  reusing  and  refurbishing  as  well.  Are  there
any  organizations  that  collect  the  data  on  the  energy  consumption
so  that  consumers  might  be  more  familiar  with  what  might  be  a
best practice?

Dr.  THOMAS.  Yes.  University  researchers  do  that  kind  of  anal-
ysis. The energy use of products can also be directly measured, and
I  believe  that  in  EPEAT’s  ratings  for  green  electronics,  energy  use
is included.

Mr. SMITH. All right. Thank you very much.
And  Mr.  Bond,  one  of  the  things  that  I  don’t  believe  your  testi-
mony  addressed  is  the  rather  patchwork  nature  of  State  laws  and
various approaches, and being a former State legislator I advocate,
you  know,  flexibility.  I  think  that  we  want  states  to  be  innovative
and by no means do we want to see a boilerplate approach to this.
But what lines of research would you say are most helpful for your
members  to  be  able  to  comply  with  so  many  different  laws  and
what kind of approach might you suggest?

Mr.  BOND.  In  terms  of  the  infamous  patchwork,  I  would  have  to
think  a  little  bit  about  whether  that  question  lends  itself  much  to
research although you could certainly research the added cost, and
perhaps  cost  to  competitiveness  of  some  of  that.  We  confront  this
as an industry in multiple arenas where you do have this infamous
patchwork  across  the  states  so  at  the  same  time,  we  are  a  federal
system  and  you  need  to  respect  that,  so  the  industry  has  tried  to
engage where they can. It is one of the reasons why we as an asso-
ciation  have  most  of  the  State  leading  tech  associations  affiliated
with  us  so  that  we  really  can  work  on  that  basis.  So  I  think  that
is  an  ongoing  challenge  for  us.  I  think  the  best  solution  is  to  look
forward  to  look  for  design  for  environment  solutions  so  that  you
stay  a  step  ahead  of  the  regulators  because  ultimately—in  this

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:25 Jun 30, 2009 Jkt 047543 PO 00000 Frm 00057 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\FULL09\021109\47543 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

54

case,  that  patchwork,  if  you  are  reducing  the  need  because  you
have  really  designed  for  the  environment,  then  you  don’t  have  as
much regulation. I think that ultimately we do want to make sure
as  a  country  we  keep  our  innovation  advantage.  I  think  that  is
critically  important  in  so  many  ways.  If  the  Chair  would  bear  a
short  analogy,  it  is  kind  of  like  Mr.  Gordon  is  famously,  I  think,
the  fastest  Member  of  the  House  when  it  comes  to  the  annual
three-mile race here, but at some point if we put enough weight on
him,  it  would  have  to  be  in  the  form  of  a  vest  because  he  is  not
putting  it  on  naturally,  but  at  some  point  enough  weight  would
allow somebody else to win that race. So we want to keep Mr. Gor-
don winning, we want to keep America winning.

Mr. SMITH. Thank you. I appreciate your comments, and I guess
I  would  reiterate  the  fact  that,  you  know,  many  of  these  efforts  I
think  can  be  very  profitable  and  I  think  that  is  good,  especially  in
light  of  certain  conditions  facing  our  economy  today,  and  having
also served at the local level where a small town in Nebraska rare-
ly  has  a  landfill,  I  did  learn  a  lot  in  terms  of  what  we  can  and
should  do  and  we  did  do  to  extend  the  useful  life  of  a  landfill  in
a good, sustainable manner as well.

So thank you, Mr. Chair.
Chair GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Smith, and really let me just say,
I think the thrust and the basis of this legislation is to make recy-
cling  a  profitable,  you  know,  business  model  for  either  the  compa-
nies that Mr. Bond represents or others that want to do it, so that
is  what  we  want  to  do.  We  want  to  make  this  profitable  so  it  is
not  a  burden.  And  the  other  thing  I  will  just  quickly,  a  side  note,
you talk about as a State legislator, there is sort of a life cycle that
I  have  seen  here  in  Congress,  and  that  is  that  industry  starts  off
by  saying,  you  know,  no  regulation,  no  regulation,  and  then  some
entrepreneurial state will—you know, they will do something here,
another  one  will  do  something  there,  and  then  industry  says  oh,
please  regulate  us,  please  regulate  us  because  they  need  to  have
that continuity. That is something you will see over and over here.
Mr. Luja´n, a new Member of our committee, is recognized.
Mr.  LUJA´ N.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair,  and  thank  you  to  everyone
that  took  the  time  to  be  with  us  today.  I  would  like  to  get  back  to
some of the discussion that took place with the concern of exporting
some  of  the  toxic  materials  and  the  number  of  people  that  are
sometimes  exposed  to  these,  especially  because  most  of  them  are
low-paid workers that are sometimes exposed to these, and I appre-
ciate  the  fact  that  we  have  been  talking  about  sustainable  design
frameworks.  The  challenge  is  to  do  it  appropriately  and  the  rec-
ognition  of  the  physical-chemical  property  database.  I  would  just
like  to  hear  your  thoughts  on  other  accountability  measures  or
standards  that  could  be  implemented  within  the  e-recycling  com-
munity to prevent this from happening.

Dr.  THOMAS.  I  would  like  to  point  out  that  there  are  actually
laws governing the export of used cathode ray tubes (CRTs). Those
are  the  big  monitors  for  TVs  and  CRTs.  And  there  was  a  GAO
(Government  Accounting  Office)  report  last  year  that  concluded
that  those  laws  need  to  be  enforced.  So  some  of  the  legislation  al-
ready  exists.  You  might  look  at  the  CRT  rule  and  it  may  need  to
cover some other electronic devices as well.

Dr.  ANASTAS.  I  completely  agree  with  the  perspective  that  we
have a large problem that needs to be dealt with today in e-waste.
I guess the only point that I make is, the reason that the research,
the innovations, and design for disassembly and new materials and
new  energy  storage  is  so  important  is  so  that  we  know  that  two
steps  forward  in  our  current  problem  is  going  to  be  two  steps  for-
ward and not one step back, that we don’t keep on creating. As we
all  know,  the  rate  of  production  of  these  electronics  is  not  slowing
down  and  so  that  is  why  the  design  is  so  important  in  addition  to
the problem that you are focusing on.

Mr.  BOND.  And  I  would  add,  Mr.  Luja´n,  just  very  quickly,  that
you  will  find  our  industry  very  much  in  support  of  strong  inter-
national  safeguards  and  a  regime  here  to  protect  workers  and  the
environment  here  and  around  the  world.  These  things  do  get  tied
up  in  other  international  agreements  whether  it  is  trade  or  others
and  so  again  affirming  the  Chair’s  call  for  getting  it  right.  There
are some facets to the question but you are going to find the indus-
try supportive of your core goals.

Mr.  CADE.  Towards  that  end,  the  U.S.  EPA  just  concluded  back
in  October  last  year  standards  called  Responsible  Recycling.  I  was
part  of  that  stakeholder  process.  It  took  about  three  years  to  work
through  it.  I  think  a  lot  of  the  issues  are  addressed  there.  There
are some people who would suggest that they are not high enough
standards. I suggest that what we need to do is implement swiftly
those  responsible  recycling  standards,  or  the  R2  standards,  and
then continue the research to see what is next in those steps. What
has  been  presented  and  what  is  now  public  documentation  is  real-
ly, really quite good, and I believe the Institute for Scrap Recycling
Industries  is  going  to  be  the  first  body  to  have  certification  avail-
able  for  electronics  recyclers,  and  quite  frankly,  we  are  excited
about doing that. Hopefully that will come about by the end of the
year.
Mr.  LUJA´ N.  Thank  you.  And  Mr.  Cade,  specifically  in  your  testi-
mony you also addressed, and we heard from you today, about how
we  could  be  utilizing  some  of  the  technology  to  support  a  smart
grid  application,  and  just  to  hear  your  thoughts  again  just  to  ex-
pand  that  on  a  large-scale  application  of  what  kind  of  benefits  we
could see as a result of that?

Mr.  CADE.  Well,  the  smart  grid  by  the  utilities  will  bring—will
allow  utilities  to  control  the  grid  to  the  home.  In  order  to  really
take advantage of that smart grid and differential pricing, you are
going  to  need  the  user  in  the  home,  the  homeowner,  or  the  person
in  the  apartment,  to  take  advantage  of  that  differential  pricing  or
that  deferred  usage,  and  technology  is  an  obvious  answer  to  those
issues.  Also  too  is  when  this  equipment  is  rebuilt  and  refurbished,
it is U.S. jobs, and frankly, I am worried about that right now.

And  I  believe  a  perfect  example  of  what  we  can  do  in  terms  of
refurbished  equipment  is  the  coming  2010  decennial  census.  It  is
a  relatively  short-term  project  as  projects  go  on  a  government
basis. It will have relatively large volume. I think that if we made
sure  in  the  census  that  refurbished  equipment  was  part  of  the
equation,  I  think  we  can  really  see  it  as  a  demonstration  project
that  would  be  very  bold  by  the  Federal  Government  to  bring  some
real awareness that reuse is a viable option.

Mr. LUJA´ N. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Chair GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Luja´n.
I see no one to my right other than my friend, Mr. Hall, who has

passed. Dr. Griffith, would you like to be recognized?

Mr. GRIFFITH. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think this is a very, very
important  discussion  that  we  are  having,  and  the  manufacturer  of
consumer  products  with  known  carcinogens  is  an  interesting  con-
cept,  and  we  recognize  that  this  is  not  only  a  great  part  of  our
economy  but  we  also  recognize  the  danger  that  we  see  here,  and
even though we may ship them off to be incinerated in some other
country, once they are in the air we know they are on the way back
here.  And  so  small,  trace  amounts,  whether  it  be  antimony,  ar-
senic,  or  brominated  hydrocarbons,  we  recognize  that  200-plus
years  ago  the  first  malignancy  that  we  related  to  hydrocarbon  ex-
posure  were  the  chimney  sweeps  in  London  with  testicular  cancer.
We know that this is going to occur as these electronic products be-
come  more  imminent,  closer  to  our  skin,  our  bodies,  and  even  im-
planted into us. So I compliment the Chair on this subject because
I  believe  that  it  has  great  ramifications  for  us  because  we  are  not
going to decrease the amount of these products in our environment
but  we  are  going  to  increase  them,  and  I  think  the  safety  of  it  is
not  just  in  recycling,  et  cetera.  I  think  it  has  a  health  care  rami-
fication. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

Chair GORDON. Thank you, Dr. Griffith.
Now the gentlelady from Pennsylvania.
Ms.  DAHLKEMPER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair.  I  apologize.  I  was  at
another  meeting  and  missed  most  of  your  testimony,  so  my  ques-
tion is fairly basic, but are there any existing e-waste programs ei-
ther domestically or in some other foreign nation that we can actu-
ally  look  at  for  its  merit  to  further  study,  possibly  to  replicate  at
this point?

Mr. CADE. I would defer back to the Responsible Recycling stand-
ards  that  were  set  up  by  the  U.S.  EPA  and  really  look  to  those  as
the  standard  that  we  have  today,  but  again,  I  want  to  reiterate
that  we  need  more  research  and  that  is  why  I  applaud  the  Chair
in  this  draft  legislation  that  we  really  do  need  to  research  and
make  sure  that  we  do  it  right  in  the  process.  I  mean,  just  kind  of
an interesting aside, my carbon offset or mitigation for traveling to
this  meeting  is  refurbishing  a  computer.  You  refurbish  two  com-
puters,  it  is  the  equivalent  of  taking  a  car  off  the  road  for  a  year.

Ms. DAHLKEMPER. Yes?
Mr.  OMELCHUCK.  It  is  the  case  that,  deferring  to  Mr.  Bond’s
numbers,  that  approximately  18  states  now  have  electronics  e-
waste  bills  in  place  today.  In  addition,  the  best-known  inter-
national  example  is  the  E.U.  has  a  program.  China  is  in  the  proc-
ess  of  emulating  that  largely,  not  entirely.  So  there  are  a  lot  of
models that can be researched and I think it would be very fruitful
to  research  the  environmental  and  economic  aspects  of  all  those
and there is enough to research.

Mr. CADE. If I can just add to that, one of the things that is real-
ly  interesting,  of  those  State  models,  there  is  only  one,  the  State
of  Illinois,  where  reuse  is  actually  included  in  the  legislation  and
there  is  actually  concepts  on  that.  I  think  one  of  the  things  that
is  the  advantage  of  all  of  the  states  is,  we  have  a  number  of  dif-

ferent experiments going on about e-waste and the research is very
important. I think when we talk to people, for example, in Oregon,
about  their  law  and  we  talk  to  them  about  reuse  and  how  it  was
included  in  Illinois,  they  kind  of  went  oh,  yeah,  we  forgot  that.  So
I think there is real fertile ground by the States’ entrepreneurship,
as  the  Chairman  represented,  coming  out  with  the  legislation  and
I  suspect  in  a  couple  of  years  that  we  will  be  back  here  with  the
question of national legislation, and if we do our research right, we
will  have  some  very  good  answers  and  some  very  good  under-
standing.

Ms. DAHLKEMPER. Thank you.
Chair  GORDON.  Just  a  quick  comment.  I  think  you  are  correct,
and that is what we are trying to do—is get in front of that to have
the research so when that inevitable likelihood of legislation comes
up or regulation, that we can try to do it right.
Ms. Biggert, you would like to close us out?
Ms.  BIGGERT.  Yes.  I  probably  could  use  a  lifeline  because  I
missed all the questions. I am sorry if I ask something that has al-
ready  been  asked  and  I  am  sorry.  I  had  two  Committee  hearings
and  one  markup  all  at  the  same  time  and  I  need  a  clone.  Do  you
do  cloning  too  or  just  computers?  I  think  what  is  important,  you
know, is the recycling and maybe, Mr. Cade, you can just tell us—
you probably told us—just tell us one more time about how impor-
tant  the  reuse  is  and  is  there  anything  that  would  be  better  in
what to do with our e-waste?

Mr. CADE. Well, again, thank you Congresswoman, for your ques-
tion.  I  think  reuse  really  is  the  fundamental  issue.  The  analogy  I
like  to  use  is,  currently  without  electronics  it  is  the  equivalent  of
taking  a  loaf  of  bread  and  taking  three  slices  out  of  it  and  then
putting  it  in  the  cupboard  and  two  years  later  coming  back  and
wondering  why  it  is  moldy  and  no  longer  good  to  use.  We  need  to
be able to make sure that people feel safe about getting rid of their
equipment, that we have that standard set and that it is clear and
it  is  transparent  to  individuals,  and  once  that  happens,  then  they
will start to bring their equipment out and then we need to be able
to have the database necessary to understand what is in that prod-
uct  so  that  we  can  figure  out  how  to  reuse  it.  So  we  need  to  build
a complete infrastructure from scratch that includes reuse, that in-
cludes processing and includes understanding of what chemicals, et
cetera,  are  in  there.  That  was  quite  frankly  in  the  stakeholder  ne-
gotiations  on  R2.  It  was  incredibly  difficult  to  try  to  parse  out  all
of those different steps with the lack of data.

So, you know, Mr. Chair, I encourage you. The blanks that I saw
in  the  draft  legislation  were  basically  around  the  dollar  amounts.
I  know  it  is  a  tough  request  but  I  think  money  spent  here  will  go
a  long  way  to  helping  our  environment  and  helping  not  only  indi-
viduals  but  also  all  of  what  we  do  here.  So  thank  you  very  much.
Dr.  ANASTAS.  If  I  could  just  add  to  that,  I  completely  support
what has been said about the recycle, reuse, and the imperative of
that. We want to also keep an eye on design so that we make sure
that we are not cycling materials through our society and our econ-
omy that are toxic, that are hazardous. The point that I would like
to  make  is  that  there  is  nothing  about  the  performance  of  these
materials,  whether  it  is  in  a  display,  in  a  housing,  in  battery  stor-

age,  that  requires  them  to  be  toxic.  There  is  nothing  about  the
manufacturer of an electronic that requires it to use literally thou-
sands  of  times  more  material  than  actually  winds  up  in  the  prod-
uct.  These  are  design  challenges,  and  by  taking  on  the  basic  re-
search  with  the  sustainability  frameworks,  we  can  change  this
equation.

Ms. BIGGERT. Mr. Omelchuck.
Mr.  OMELCHUCK.  Thank  you.  I  would  like  to  kind  of  add  to  Dr.
Anastas’s  point  and  remind  us  that  because  the  dramatic  share  of
the  impacts  of  electronics  happen  during  their  manufacture  and
their  indirect  materials,  my  point  is,  it  is  a  pleasant  concept  to
think about closing the material loop on electronics, and if we could
only  recover  them  at  the  end,  we  could  make  new  electronics  out
of  the  old  electronics  and  we  would  be—you  know,  that  would  be
a nice closed loop. And the reality is that if we were to do that 100
percent, recover 100 percent of electronics, we would be recovering
perhaps  a  tenth  of  one  percent  of  the  environmental  impact  that
was  invested  in  manufacturing  electronics.  So  I  think  it  is  impor-
tant  for  us  to  keep  that  in  mind,  that  closing  the  material  loop  is
really not the goal, the overall goal.

Ms. BIGGERT. Do you have any figures about how much goes into

the landfill versus how much is recovered and reused?

Mr.  CADE.  There  are  some  figures,  Dr.  Thomas  has  a  few,  but
quite  frankly,  those  numbers  I  don’t  trust.  We  did  a  two-week
study  at  one  of  the  four  waste  collection  centers  of  the  city  of  Chi-
cago and asked them to pull all computers that came through their
garbage  trucks,  in  other  words,  someone  literally  put  it  in  their
garbage. We asked them to pull all the PCs out of there, and there
were  only  37  that  came  in  a  two-week  period  for  about  a  quarter
of  a  million  households.  So  it  just  doesn’t  seem  like  the  numbers
work on that. By the way, we did take one of the hard drives that
had gone through the compression——

Ms. BIGGERT. That had been squished?
Mr. CADE. That had been squished, and we were able to read the
information  and  who  owned  it.  We  looked  up  on  the  Internet  and
we  found  the  guy’s  address.  So  we  were  able  to  actually  backtrack
with  that.  So  again,  it  is  important  stuff  that  we  need  to  work  on.
Mr.  BOND.  Congresswoman,  if  I  could,  I  just  wanted  to  under-
score  that  many  of  the  leading  companies,  I  will  give  the  example
of HP, for instance, that have recycling programs, they do not send
materials  to  landfills.  So  I  don’t  want  you  to  assume  that  every-
thing automatically is headed——

Ms. BIGGERT. No, I was thinking more of the consumer probably

is the one that doesn’t know what to do with it.

Chair GORDON. I think the doctor might have a rebuttal.
Ms. BIGGERT. Okay, Dr. Thomas.
Dr.  THOMAS.  No,  I  actually  want  to  agree  that  we  don’t  really
know  where  electronics  are  going  and  how  much  is  recycled.  EPA
tried  to  estimate  this.  They  just  pretty  much  have  to  sit  down  in
a  room  with  a  piece  of  paper  and  make  some  estimates.  We  don’t
know  where  they  are.  We  don’t  know  how  many  are  in  people’s
basements,  how  long  they  keep  them  there.  We  don’t  know  how
many  are  sent  to  other  countries.  There  is  just  nothing.  We  know

very well what goes through the manufacturing system, what is re-
tailed, what is sold and after that it is just dark.

Ms. BIGGERT. I have a couple in my attic that are really old and
they  are  the  old  Macs  with  the  little  screen  and  my  kids  used  to
use  and  I  keep  worrying  about  them  being  there.  They  are  too  old
to be reusable, but what do I do with them? Just take them to the
recycling centers that we have for electronics?

Mr. CADE. Congresswoman, I will pick it up next week. I will be

Chair GORDON. Thank you, Ms. Biggert. Let me thank our panel
for  a  very  interesting  hearing,  and  let  me  once  again  suggest  that
we  are  welcome  to  your  specific  suggestions.  This  is  only  a  draft.
Mr.  Hall  raised  some  very  good  questions  in  his  earlier  comments.
We  want  to  try  to  address  those  so  we  can  get  the  very  best  bill
we can. This is an important topic.

And  so  now  the  record  will  remain  open  for  additional  state-
ments  from  the  Members  and  for  answers  to  any  of  the  follow-up
questions the Committee may ask of the witnesses. The hearing is
now is adjourned.

[Whereupon, at 11:45 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Valerie Thomas, Anderson Interface Associate Professor of Natural Sys-
tems,  School  of  Industrial  and  Systems  Engineering,  and  School  of  Public  Pol-
icy, Georgia Institute of Technology

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. The  discussion  draft  includes  a  section  that  would  make  funding  available  for

joint public/private research projects.

Q1a. How  would  the  program  in  the  draft  legislation  differ  from  existing  programs

at the federal level?

A1a. Currently,  there  are  no  programs  funding  e-waste  research  at  the  federal
level.  Researchers  proposing  e-waste  research  can  submit  proposals  to  broad  Na-
tional  Science  Foundation  programs  related  to  reducing  the  environmental  impacts
of  manufacturing;  in  this  case  the  proposals  compete  against  all  other  manufac-
turing and sustainability research topics.
Q1b. How  would  this  funding  effort  integrate  into  the  existing  overall  e-waste  strat-

egy?

A1b. The  U.S.  EPA  has  been  promoting  e-waste  recycling;  this  funding  could  sup-
port that effort.
Q2. Many of you discuss what we should do for electronic waste that will result from
products  that  are  currently  being  sold  or  are  on  the  drawing  board.  What  do
we  do  with  all  the  orphan  waste  and  products  people  still  have  stored  in  their
attics? How will research assist us in properly disposing of this type of electronic
waste?

A2. Immediate  e-waste  problems  should  be  addressed  by  action,  not  research.  En-
forcement  of  the  CRT  rule,  more  comprehensive  regulation  of  electronic  waste  ex-
ports, and legislation for end-of-life management of electronics would provide a basis
for development of appropriate electronics recycling capability for existing products.
Q3. What  lessons  can  be  learned  from  the  ‘‘Mercury-Containing  and  Rechargeable

Battery Recycling Act’’ about federal efforts to encourage recycling?

A3. The  Mercury-Containing  and  Rechargeable  Battery  Recycling  Act  does  not  re-
quire battery recycling. It requires that rechargeable batteries have a recycling label
and  that  they  be  easily  removable,  that  EPA  establish  a  public  education  program,
and  it  loosens  the  hazardous  waste  restrictions  on  handling  and  transport  of  bat-
teries.  Despite  significant  voluntary  efforts  to  promote  recycling,  the  battery  recy-
cling rate remains below 20 percent. The lesson is that these measures are not suffi-
cient to ensure high recycling rates.
Q3a. Why do you believe that consumers will not recycle e-waste instead of disposing

of it?

A3a. Currently, it is generally not easy for consumers to recycle e-waste.
Q3b. Car batteries are one of the few products that are recycled with regularity. This
reality  has  to  do,  in  part,  with  the  fact  that  auto  repair  shops  collect  old  bat-
teries  when  they  are  replaced.  How  could  this  type  of  success  be  replicated  in
the e-waste field?

A3b. Most  states  have  strong  lead-acid  battery  recycling  laws  that  prohibit  lead-
acid battery land disposal or incineration and require recycling, that require battery
sellers  to  take  back  batteries  for  recycling,  that  require  battery  sellers  to  charge  a
deposit for sale of batteries in some cases, and that specify fines for noncompliance.

This model of recycling could be replicated for e-waste.

Q4. You  suggest  that  a  standardized  label  is  needed  for  identifying  and  tracking
various  models  of  electronic  equipment,  and  further  suggest  that  manufacturers
and recyclers would derive benefits from this system.

Q4a. Can  you  expand  on  how  labeling,  be  it  electronic  or  printed,  would  improve

upon visual identification and sorting of these pieces of equipment?

A4a. Visual identification and hand-sorting by trained workers can indeed be quite
effective for some tasks.

Automation  does,  however,  have  many  advantages.  Labels  can  be  read  automati-
cally,  either  by  a  bar  code  reader  (for  bar  code  labels)  or  by  an  RFID  reader  (for

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:25 Jun 30, 2009 Jkt 047543 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\FULL09\021109\47543 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

63

RFID tags), and the information would be automatically recorded in a computerized
database,  which  can  link  to  information  about  that  product,  such  as  the  value  of
components, the identification of hazardous components, instructions for dismantle-
ment, and so on.

Specifically,  labeling  could  allow  for  better  identification  of  re-usable  parts;  reus-
able parts are a key component of the profitability of many electronics recyclers. In
addition,  labeling  can  significantly  reduce  costs  for  reporting  to  regulatory  agencies
and  to  large  customers;  recyclers  report  that  these  reporting  costs  are  significant.
The  benefits  of  automation  for  recycling  are  the  same  as  the  benefits  of  automa-
tion  for  recycling.  Initial  benefits  of  automation  include  some  cost  reduction  due  to
efficiency  and  some  cost  reduction  due  to  reduced  labor  costs.  As  automation  be-
comes  more  integrated  into  the  industrial  process,  it  allows  for  the  development  of
new processes and innovations.
Q4b. To optimize these efficiencies, is labeling needed for overall units, or should la-

beling also include components?

A4b. Discussions with recycling industry representatives generally indicate that la-
beling of key components as well as the overall unit would be most effective.
Q5. There is a numbering system associated with the recycling of plastics. However,
it  has  been  suggested  that  this  system  does  not  work  well  due  to  lack  of  public
knowledge. How would you propose to prevent similar difficulties with electronic
labeling for recycling?

A5. The  plastics  labeling  system  was  developed  to  help  consumers  sort  plastics.
Plastic  recycling  technology  has  changed  over  time  so  that  the  numbers  are  no
longer relevant to the recycling technologies used in many locations.

The technology for e-waste recycling can also be expected to change over time. For
this reason, the label should simply identify the make and model of the product; the
information about the recycling of that product would be kept in databases that can
be changed without needing to change the label.
Q6. What are the energy costs of recycling, reusing, or refurbishing electronics? What

organizations collect data of this sort?

A6. No  organizations  are  collecting  and  reporting  data  on  the  direct  energy  costs
of recycling, reusing, and refurbishing electronics. The environmental impacts of re-
cycling  and  refurbishing  operations  are  generally  assumed  to  be  small  compared  to
the  environmental  benefits  of  recycling.  Life  cycle  assessments  indicate  electronics
manufacturing  is  highly  energy  intensive  and  that,  therefore,  reuse  of  electronics
can save energy by reducing manufacturing energy needs.1

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Paul  T.  Anastas,  Teresa  and  H.  John  Heinz  III  Professor  in  the  Prac-
tice  of  Chemistry  for  the  Environment,  School  of  Forestry  and  Environmental
Studies; Director, Center for Green Chemistry and Green Engineering, Yale Uni-
versity

Questions submitted by Chair Bart Gordon
Q1. How would a database containing the chemical and physical properties of mate-
rials used, or potentially used, in electronics be used? Does such a database cur-
rently exist?

A1. I am not aware of a database that duplicates the purpose of the proposed data-
base. The proposed database would be used by electronics designers in assessing the
physical/chemical  properties  which  are  directly  related  to  both  the  performance  as
well as the impact of the electronic on human health and the environment. By hav-
ing  this  information,  those  wishing  to  ensure  that  our  high  performance  computers
have  a  reduced  impact  on  the  environment  can  use  it  to  identify  substitute  chemi-
cals and alternative substances in the electronics components.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. The  discussion  draft  includes  a  section  that  would  make  funding  available  for

joint public/private research projects.

Q1a. How  would  the  program  in  the  draft  legislation  differ  from  existing  programs

at the federal level?

A1a. I  am  not  aware  of  any  programs  that  are  focused  on  the  issue  of  the  impacts
of electronics on human health and the environment throughout their life cycle. The
research  that  would  be  the  basis  of  this  draft  legislation  would  provide  new  design
tools  to  ensure  that  our  current  electronics  waste  programs  are  more  effective  and,
as  importantly,  make  sure  that  our  future  electronics  don’t  cause  the  same  issues
as our current and historic approaches to designing electronics.
Q1b. How  would  this  funding  effort  integrate  into  the  existing  overall  e-waste  strat-

egy?

A1b. While  there  is  currently  good  work  being  conducted  on  electronics  recycling
and reuse, there is little research focusing on the basis of how to make all life cycle
stages  of  electronics  less  harmful  to  humans  and  the  environment.  While  the  elec-
tronic  waste  programs  currently  are  making  a  bad  situation  less  bad,  there  is  re-
search needed to understand how we design our electronics to be genuinely good for
humans  and  the  environment.  This  means  ensuring  that  they  have  increased  per-
formance and reduced adverse impact on the environment. Rather than simply deal-
ing  with  only  the  waste  at  the  end-of-life  stage,  these  sustainability  frameworks
allow practitioners to be able to design such that economic and environmental goals
are mutually reinforcing.
Q2. Many of you discuss what we should do for electronic waste that will result from
products  that  are  currently  being  sold  or  are  on  the  drawing  board.  What  do
we  do  with  all  the  orphan  waste  and  products  people  still  have  stored  in  their
attics? How will research assist us in properly disposing of this type of electronic
waste?

A2. The research that will be done under this legislation can help deal with the ex-
isting  waste  in  many  ways.  The  research  can  allow  us  to  better  understand  how  to
separate  the  wide  range  of  substances  that  make  up  most  electronics  that  include
plastics,  polymers,  metals,  glass,  and  much  more.  By  being  able  to  separate  these
substances, we begin to be able to extract the value from this waste and use it pro-
ductively.  The  research  will  also  involve  new  sensors  to  be  built  into  new  dis-
assembly  facilities.  It  will  involve  new  process  and  reactor  technologies  to  be  able
to  transform  these  mixed  materials.  This  research  will  need  many  disciplines  in-
volved  including  electrochemists,  mechanical  engineers,  product  designers,  analyt-
ical  chemists,  and  others.  While  I  am  only  scratching  the  surface  of  the  various
ways  that  this  research  can  impact  existing  orphan  electronics,  it  is  only  because
the  potential  is  enormous  and  there  may  be  approaches  in  the  research  community
that people have not even considered as yet.
Q3. You point out that electronic production is increasing exponentially, so that even
with steady improvements in each generation of devices, the overall negative en-

65

vironmental  impact  may  still  increase.  What  level  of  improvement  over  time  is
needed to begin to reduce the negative consequences of e-waste?

A3. The  good  news  about  the  approaches  that  I  have  outlined  in  the  testimony
about  sustainable  design  through  the  12  Principles  of  Green  Chemistry  and  Green
Engineering  is  that  it  is  not  merely  reducing  material  and  energy  (which  it  is),  it
is  also  addressing  the  intrinsic  nature  of  the  energy  and  the  materials  used  in  the
electronics  and  throughout  their  life  cycle.  This  means  that  even  if  some  level  of
‘‘waste’’  were  continue  to  be  produced,  the  inherent  nature  of  that  waste  would  be
of reduced concern for humans and the environment because it would be less toxic,
less  depleting,  more  degradable,  less  persistent,  etc.  These  improvements  would  be
coupled  with  the  innovations  in  performance  that  have  marked  the  history  of  the
electronics  industry  and  make  the  environmental  and  economic  performances  work
hand-in-hand. This has been achieved in a number of other industry sectors and the
potential in the electronics sector is tremendous.
Q4. You quote a 1999 study that suggests the average lifespan for a PC is two years.
Q4a. Is  this  driven  mostly  by  businesses  that  regularly  replace  the  inventory  while

home consumers hang onto their equipment longer?

A4a. I am not aware of the exact data on the breakdown of business electronics life-
time versus home electronics lifetime.
Q4b. Has  there  been  no  change  in  the  life-spans  of  personal  computers  in  the  last

10 years since this study was published?

A4b. The issue is very often not the functional lifetime of a computer or other elec-
tronics.  Many  of  the  electronics  that  are  ‘‘waste’’  work  fine  and  their  life-spans  are
very  long.  These  electronics  are  discarded  because  they  are  viewed  as  not  having
the  latest  capabilities  or  are  stylistically  not  as  appealing.  Making  the  electronics
simply more durable is not going to address these issues. Making their functionality
and upgradability more modular may be one way to address the issue.
Q4c. Do consumers and businesses have similar patterns of use and disposal of elec-

tronic devices?

A4c. I  am  not  aware  of  data  on  the  use  and  disposal  patterns  of  business  and  con-
sumers.
Q5. What is your definition of ‘‘toxic’’ and ‘‘hazardous material?’’? Is the goal of com-

plete elimination of these materials realistic?

A5. The  definition  of  hazard  is  the  ability  to  cause  adverse  consequence.  There  is
nothing  about  the  chemicals  and  substances  used  in  electronics  and  the  functions
we  wish  them  to  serve  that  REQUIRES  them  to  be  toxic.  That  being  the  case,  it
is simply a scientific and design challenge to address this issue through the research
this  bill  supports.  This  reduction  and  elimination  of  hazardous  substances  through
green chemistry has been done by many companies in many sectors and it can cer-
tainly  be  done  by  the  electronics  sector.  The  research  that  will  allow  it  to  happen
will simultaneously benefit the performance and economics of the electronics indus-
try.
Q6. Does  better  design  necessarily  mean  less  toxic,  more  efficient  and  easily  recycla-
ble?  Would  it  also  include  more  focused  designing  for  difference  consumer
groups?  How  would  that  alter  the  environmental  impact  of  electronic  products?
A6. Hazard is a design flaw. Unless a particular hazard is intended, such as in the
case  of  pesticides,  then  unintended  hazard—unintended  adverse  consequence—is
something that can and should be addressed.
Q7. You describe a lack of quality data on the stocks and flows of various materials
crucial  to  the  electronics  industry.  What  mechanisms  currently  exist  to  estimate
the amount of precious metals available on the market and the reserves of those
materials?

A7. The  best  work  in  this  area  that  I  am  aware  of  is  being  conducted  by  Prof.
Thomas  Graedel  of  Yale  University  on  the  stocks  and  flows  of  metals  in  commerce.
I  am  aware  that  his  research  requires  working  with  national  agencies  in  the  U.S.
and  around  the  world  as  well  as  with  private  data  sources.  There  is  very  little  re-
search  funding  in  this  area  for  the  development  of  data  sources.  This  is  important
of course strategically both for economic and national security reasons.

Q8. In  your  testimony,  you  define  frameworks  of  sustainable  design  and  illustrate
your  point  with  the  example  of  closing  the  material  loop,  or  working  towards
achieving a zero waste scenario.

Q8a. In order for this approach to work, particularly with material synergies outside
the electronics industries, how would you propose fostering communication and
information exchange between parties?

A8a. The  sustainability  design  frameworks  outlined  in  the  testimony  view  closed
loops as merely one aspect of sustainable design. It is essential to incorporate design
into  the  inherent  nature  of  the  substances  and  energy  sources  to  ensure  they  are
benign and sustainable as well. Closed loops can be achieved at many scales; in the
process,  within  a  factory,  within  an  industrial  park,  or  within  a  city.  Each  of  these
scales will require different levels of communication and coordination. Transparency
on  what  materials  are  flowing  through  a  system  is  essential.  This  requires  compa-
nies  and  other  organizations  to  be  willing  or  required  to  both  know  what  materials
are  coming  into  and  being  released  by  their  operations  as  well  be  willing  to  share
this  information.  This  communication  and  information  exchange  will  allow  for  the
boldest opportunities to be realized. Even in the absence of this level of communica-
tion,  individual  companies  and  industry  sectors  can  still  achieve  closed  loops  very
effectively within themselves.
Q8b. Would the green database outlined in the draft legislation sufficient? Or would
it  be  necessary  to  incorporate  a  clearinghouse  such  as  the  pollution  prevention
resource exchange?

A8b. The  database  suggested  in  the  legislation  would  be  an  essential  element  that
would  enable  closed  loops  to  happen  but  it  would  not  be  sufficient  on  its  own.  It
would  inform  designers  what  is  possible  in  closed  loop  systems  but  not  necessarily
provide  enough  detail  on  where  those  materials  are  used  geographically  and  indus-
trially. A resource exchange database would be valuable but should be more robust
than the current EPA database.
Q9. How  would  you  suggest  adapting  the  IGERT  program,  which  currently  focuses
on interdisciplinary research and education, to include partnerships with indus-
try?

A9. The IGERT program is regarded as one of the crown jewels of the research pro-
grams  from  NSF.  Partnership  research  programs  with  industry  could  be  achieved
through the development of a parallel program or an option within the IGERT pro-
gram  However,  it  may  be  easier  to  look  at  programs  such  as  the  NSF’s  Industry
University  Cooperative  Research  Centers  (IUCRC)  and  instead  extend  those  to  in-
clude educational aspects to them especially for graduate students. The IUCRC has
already dealt well with many of the problematic issues that arise in academic-indus-
try  partnerships  and  this  approach  would  ensure  that  the  IGERT  program  is  not
unintentionally disrupted.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. The  discussion  draft  includes  a  section  that  would  make  funding  available  for

join public/private research projects.

Q1a. How  would  the  program  in  the  draft  legislation  differ  from  existing  programs

at the federal level?

A1a. There are currently no programs at the federal level that would establish pub-
lic/private research projects into the issue of green electronics design. The program,
therefore, would establish a new program with a new focus.
Q1b. How  would  this  funding  effort  integrate  into  the  existing  overall  e-waste  strat-

egy?

A1b. Currently,  there  is  no  federal  strategy  for  providing  direction  or  prioritization
on  the  issue  of  e-waste.  The  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  regulates  the
management of hazardous wastes, which may include some (not all) electronic prod-
ucts.  This  funding  effort  would  help  prioritize  environmental  risks  from  electronic
products and provide overall direction to a federal strategy.
Q2. Many of you discuss what we should do for electronic waste that will result from
products  that  are  currently  being  sold  or  are  on  the  drawing  board.  What  do
we  do  with  all  the  orphan  waste  and  products  people  still  have  stored  in  their
attics? How will research assist us in properly disposing of this electronic waste?
A2. It  is  correct  that  design  incentives  or  guideline  or  standards  will  not  address
historic electronic waste, which will require proper management. The research that
will be generated through this legislation will help us determine which types of his-
toric waste will require hazardous waste management and which may be discarded
in  conventional  waste  management  facilities  due  to  its  low-risk  status.  Currently,
that very basic information is missing.
Q3. In your support for a National Academies study of e-waste, you suggest that an
authoritative baseline of e-waste impacts is needed. What impacts of e-waste are
currently in dispute?

A3. There  has  never  been  a  science-based  assessment  conducted  of  the  environ-
mental  risks  posed  by  electronic  products—as  a  result,  this  central  issue,  remains
in dispute. Also, the best ways to manage the different types of e-waste—some prod-
ucts  have  high  reuse  potential,  some  products  can  be  managed  in  municipal  solid
waste  facilities  and  some  will  require  treatment  as  hazardous  waste—the  cat-
egorization  and  requirements  for  each  have  never  been  fully  researched  and  ad-
dressed.
Q4. How are EPEAT’s criteria affecting producers’ design decisions?
A4. EPEAT, as a federal and institutional purchaser procurement requirement, op-
erates as a significant driver of green design principles for electronics. The move to
LED lighting for computer monitors (over mercury-containing lamps) is an example
of an EPEAT environmental design success story.
Q5. One of the things I noticed you did not address in your testimony was the patch-
work  of  State  laws  dealing  with  electronic  waste.  If  this  framework  continues
for the next decade, what lines of research would be most helpful for your mem-
bers to be able to comply with so many disparate laws?

A5. The  State  laws  establish  requirements  for  end-of-life  management  of  certain
electronic  products—mainly,  computers  and  televisions.  Currently,  they  are  oper-
ating  as  State  experiments  into  which  financing  models  work  the  most  efficiently
and  cost  effectively.  There  may  be  a  time  when  the  industry  works  with  Congress
and  other  stakeholders  to  establish  a  national  model.  Until  that  time,  the  informa-
tion  gathered  at  the  State  level  regarding  the  costs  and  economies  of  scale  associ-
ated with e-waste management will help inform this issue going forward.
Q6. Industry  often  partners  with  academia  to  conduct  research.  Given  the  current
level  of  interest  in  moving  the  electronics  industry  in  a  ‘‘green’’  direction,  why
do  you  feel  that  this  type  of  legislation  is  needed?  Is  it  just  a  matter  of  funding
basic research?

A6. The  issue  is  larger  than  the  simple  issue  of  funding  basic  research.  Electronic
products  are  the  engine  of  our  economy  and  the  need  to  design  them  for  environ-
mentally appropriate and more cost-of-life end-of-life management is a societal issue
in  which  all  stakeholders  must  participate—the  product  designers,  federal,  State
and  local  environmental  agencies,  the  science  community,  environmental  stake-
holders, and recyclers—all stakeholders have a role to play in constructing sustain-
able  solutions  to  this  issue.  It  is  critical  that  we  fund  the  basic  science  that  is  at
the core of the issue and we need to the Federal Government to play a central role
for  credibility  and  accountability  purposes.  Only  then  will  all  stakeholders  accept
the results and move forward in a balanced and meaningful way.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Jeff  Omelchuck,  Executive  Director,  Green  Electronics  Council,  Elec-

tronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT)

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. The  discussion  draft  includes  a  section  that  would  make  funding  available  for

joint public/private research projects.

Q1a. How  would  the  program  in  the  draft  legislation  differ  from  existing  programs

at the federal level?

A1a. I  am  not  aware  of  other  federal  programs  that  would  create  centers  to  re-
search issues related to e-waste and it does not appear to me that e-waste is a focus
of  much  federal  research.  Perhaps  existing  programs  could  be  directed  to  research
the issues identified in the draft bill.
Q1b. How  would  this  funding  effort  integrate  into  the  existing  overall  e-waste  strat-

egy?

A1b. I am not aware of an ‘‘existing overall e-waste strategy.’’ In fact, that is a very
large  part  of  the  problem!  I  don’t  believe  the  Federal  Government  has  developed  a
national  program  or  approach  to  e-waste  recycling.  Many  municipalities  and  local
agencies  that  manage  solid  waste  have  banned  electronics  of  various  types  from
their landfills or incinerators. Thus, in large parts of the U.S. there is no organized
and regulated way for citizens to safely dispose of e-waste. As a result, our e-waste
stays  in  our  closets  and  basements,  is  disposed  in  municipal  systems  that  are  not
designed to handle this material, or is dumped illegally. Several leading electronics
manufacturers and retailers have implemented recycling programs but they are usu-
ally quite limited, at a cost, and collectively they recover only a few percent of total
e-waste. Private sector ‘‘recyclers’’ have emerged and some are very good, but much
of  that  material  is  exported  to  countries  where  it  is  ‘‘recycled’’  using  the  worst  pos-
sible practices.

This absence of a federal program, refusal of municipalities to handle e-waste, the
growing ocean of e-waste in closets and basements, and the resulting private sector
has caused a growing number of states to develop and implement their own e-waste
recycling  programs.  These  programs  are  often  quite  different  from  each  other,  and
each  impacts  producers,  municipalities,  recyclers,  retailers,  and  consumers  dif-
ferently.  Because  of  federal  inaction  we  are  on  a  path  to  create  50  different  State-
specific programs.
Q2. Many  of  you  discussed  what  we  should  do  for  electronic  waste  that  will  result
from products that are currently being sold or are on the drawing boards. What
do we do with all the orphan waste and products people still have stored in their
attics?  How  will  research  assist  us  in  properly  disposing  of  this  type  of  waste?
A2. You  are  quite  right  to  focus  on  the  ocean  of  e-waste  the  public  has  in  our
homes,  and  that  problem  will  not  be  solved  by  changing  product  design  practices.
We simply must develop and implement an effective e-waste recycling program and
we  must  do  it  fast—it  is  the  only  way  to  deal  with  the  growing  ocean  of  legacy  e-
waste  and  should  be  the  highest  priority.  While  certain  research  may  be  helpful  in
implementing an effective e-waste solution, the lack of scientific research is not pre-
venting  a  solution.  What  is  preventing  a  solution  is  lack  of  political  will.  That  is
why  I  proposed  including  economic  and  policy  research  in  the  scope  of  research  in-
cluded in the bill.

Electronics  are  fundamentally  different  from  other  products,  and  certainly  from
the  ones  that  come  to  mind  when  we  think  about  recycling,  like  bottles,  cans,  and
newspaper.  Whereas  the  primary  environmental  reason  to  recycle  bottles  and  cans
is to reduce the volume of material in landfills, reduce litter, and recover the mate-
rial  for  re-use,  the  primary  environmental  problem  with  e-waste  is  its  toxicity.  We
need  to  collect  e-waste  in  order  to  keep  it  out  of  standard  municipal  landfills  and
other  inappropriate  disposal  methods  because  they  contain  many  toxic  materials.
The electronics industry has done a good job over the last several years of reducing
the overall toxicity of electronic products in general, but as you observe, that doesn’t
help us much with the ocean of legacy e-waste that was designed and manufactured
before this recent revolution.

The  key  is  collecting  e-waste  from  the  public.  Once  collected  there  exists,  or  can
be  quickly  created,  sufficient  infrastructure  to  recycle  it  properly.  By  the  way,  e-
waste recycling can be a relatively labor intensive process and could be a key source
of jobs.

70

If  we  develop  and  implement  an  effective  national  e-waste  recycling  system  we
will have solved the clear and present danger of toxics presented by legacy e-waste,
but we will forever be dealing with toxic e-waste unless we can find a way to change
the nature of the product itself. This is particularly important when we realize that
it is impossible to mine and create toxic materials, manufacture products with them,
use  those  products  in  our  homes,  businesses,  and  schools,  and  collect  and  recycle
them, without putting miners, manufacturers, users, recyclers and the environment
at  risk.  It  is  a  far  better  long-term  solution  to  find  a  way  to  change  the  design  of
these  products  over  time  so  that  perhaps,  in  time,  they  are  not  toxic.  We  will  still
likely want to recycle them for other reasons, but we will not be putting every per-
son in the process at risk.
Q3. How  does  the  co-mingling  of  different  producer’s  products  in  the  waste  stream
impact  recycling  operations?  How  can  improvements  in  one  producer’s  products
adversely affect the overall waste stream?

A3. First,  let  me  clarify  that  there  are  very  good  environmental  and  economic  rea-
sons  to  co-mingle  products  from  different  manufacturers  in  the  waste  stream.  It
would be very inefficient to create separate collection and recycling systems for each
manufacturer, you’d have to create parallel systems everywhere, and you’d have the
problem  of  orphan  products.  Even  if  one  were  to  create  consortia  of  producers  who
banded  together  to  share  a  recycling  infrastructure,  the  existence  of  multiple  con-
sortia  is  less  efficient  than  one  infrastructure,  and  if  the  consortia  combined  over
time we have effectively created one co-mingled system.

Even  though  a  co-mingled  collection  system  is  much  more  environmentally  and

economically efficient, it has its challenges:

1) It presents recyclers with a very wide variety of products to deal with. Many
electronic products contain components that must be removed from the prod-
uct  in  order  to  be  treated  appropriately  and  it  is  difficult  for  recyclers  to
know  the  best  way  to  do  that  for  every  product.  Even  if  a  producer  created
a special button that, when pressed, would release all the hazardous compo-
nents, the button would do recyclers little good if they didn’t know it existed
or where it was on each product.

2) The  co-mingling  of  different  producer’s  products  makes  it  difficult  for  indi-
vidual  manufacturers  to  benefit  from  advances  in  design  or  manufacturing
processes they might make that would make their products more easily, cost
effectively, or environmentally soundly recycled. Thus, the co-mingled nature
of  e-waste  collection  removes  the  incentive  any  manufacturer  would  have  to
improve their product.

These challenges are not insurmountable. For example, as part of my written tes-
timony  I  provided  the  report  from  an  EPA-funded  research  project  that  GEC  re-
cently  completed  in  which  we  conceptualize  a  common  database  where  producers
could  put  information  that  recyclers  need  in  order  to  effectively  recycle  their  prod-
ucts.

The  second  issue  of  creating  an  incentive  for  producers  to  make  their  products
more recyclable over time could be addressed by creating a way to evaluate specific
products  for  ‘‘recyclability’’  and  creating  a  differential  fee  to  cover  their  recycling,
so the recycling fee would be less for products that were designed to be more easily
recycled.  As  in  most  current  e-waste  recycling  systems,  this  fee  could  be  levied  at
the  time  the  product  is  sold  when  its  identity  is  known  and  the  fee  can  be  easily
collected, either visibly from the consumer, invisibly from the consumer, or from the
manufacturer  or  retailer,  or  some  combination.  This  would  provide  a  mechanism  to
optimize design of the product and its recycling system over time.

To  answer  your  last  question,  there  are  several  examples  of  how  one  producer
making  what  appear  to  be  improvements  can  actually  adversely  affect  the  overall
waste stream, and several examples of how apparent advances simply make no dif-
ference:

• The use of bio-based and biodegradable plastics would appear to reduce petro-
leum use and reduce waste at end-of-life. However, bio-based plastics are gen-
erally not compatible with recycling practices used for petro plastics and actu-
ally  contaminate  those  recyclate  streams.  So  unless  bio-based  plastics  can  be
effectively  identified  and  separated  during  recycling,  and  there  is  an  indus-
trial compost facility available, they inhibit plastics recycling. The same situa-
tion exists for wood or bamboo electronics enclosures.
• A few manufacturers have employed novel disassembly methods, particularly
to allow removal of hazardous materials like batteries or lamps. However, un-
less recyclers know about them, how to use them, and have the tools (if any),

71

they  usually  end  up  dismantling  the  product  with  a  hammer,  often  breaking
the parts that the manufacturer intended to protect, for instance, CFL lamps
that contain mercury.
• Different  plastic  resins  must  be  recycled  in  different  processes  and  plastics
are  difficult  to  separate  by  type,  so  it  would  be  very  helpful  to  reduce  the
number  of  different  plastics  that  are  used  in  electronics.  However,  one  or  a
few manufacturers doing that wouldn’t help much. It would need to be indus-
try-wide.
• Most producers mark plastic parts with codes that identify which type of plas-
tic  resin  the  part  is  made  from  to  facilitate  separation  and  recycling.  How-
ever,  some  of  the  most  sophisticated  e-waste  recycling  systems  sort  plastics
by  other  characteristics  (specific  gravity,  etc.)  in  automated  systems  so  the
marks are useless (though not harmful).

Q4. How  does  the  EPEAT  program  compare  to  the  Energy  Star  program  in  con-

sumer awareness and purchasing decisions?

A4. ENERGY  STAR  has  perhaps  the  highest  consumer  awareness  of  any  eco-label,
exceeding 75 percent awareness in the U.S. public. ENERGY STAR has come to be
trusted by millions of consumers as a reliable way to identify energy efficient prod-
ucts that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save money.

EPEAT  was  designed  primarily  for  use  by  institutional  purchasers,  organizations
that  buy  products  on  purchase  contracts.  EPEAT  was  launched  in  2006  and  is  now
required  by  more  than  $60  billion  worth  of  purchase  contracts,  including  those  of
the Federal Government. EPEAT covers a full range of product environmental char-
acteristics, including energy efficiency (in fact, ENERGY STAR is EPEAT’s primary
energy criterion). We do not track consumer awareness of EPEAT but it is certainly
very  low.  We  are  beginning  to  make  plans  to  increase  EPEAT’s  consumer  aware-
ness.

EPEAT and ENERGY STAR have a long history of cooperation and are currently
exploring  ways  to  work  together  to  help  consumers  identify  electronics  that  meet  a
broad range of ‘‘green’’ criteria.
Q5. In  your  testimony  you  mention  a  Design  for  Environment,  End-of-Life  registry
that  is  a  critical  source  of  recycling  information  for  many  electronic  products.
Would  the  Pollution  Prevention  Resource  Exchange  be  an  appropriate  place  to
warehouse this information?

A5. Perhaps. We would welcome the opportunity to explore that idea further.
Q6. How can changes in software design reduce e-waste?
A6. Many  believe  that  software  ‘‘advances’’  are  one  of  the  leading  causes  of  PC
hardware  obsolescence.  Think  of  your  last  several  computers.  How  many  met  their
end-of-life because they physically broke? I’ll bet that most became obsolete because
they would no longer run the applications software and operating systems that were
the  only  options  available,  or  succumbed  to  a  virus  or  other  software  problem  that
became  too  maddening  to  fix,  or  ‘‘got  too  slow.’’  Of  course,  the  hardware  doesn’t  ac-
tually slow down over time. These performance degradations are caused by software
changes. It seems likely that the majority of PC obsolescence is caused by software.
However,  it  appears  that  relatively  little  research  has  been  done  on  this  question.
We  would  like  to  study  this  issue  further  and  would  welcome  the  participation
of  government,  industry,  academic,  ENGO,  and  other  interested  parties  who  can
contribute.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Willie  Cade,  Founder  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  PC  Rebuilders  and

Recyclers, Home of the Computers for Schools Program

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. The  discussion  draft  includes  a  section  that  would  make  funding  available  for

joint public/private research projects.

Q1a. How  would  the  program  in  the  draft  legislation  differ  from  existing  programs

at the federal level?

A1a. The program described in the draft legislation would be managed using sound
data collection and management systems. Research, education, and technical assist-
ance  priorities  would  be  developed  through  careful  examination  and  consideration
of  the  data  collected  through  this  program.  This  approach  would  ensure  that  re-
sources  are  allocated  such  that  maximum  benefits  are  derived  from  the  monetary
resources invested.

Current  methods  for  tracking  the  origin,  use  and  management  of  e-waste  are  ex-
tremely  limited.  EPA  currently  estimates  the  amount  of  electronic  products  sold,
stored, recycled, disposed of, and exported in the U.S. using a series of assumptions
and  estimates  based  on  market  research  data  for  sales  and  data  from  electronics
collection programs along with some government statistics for sales. These data are
usually not complete or current and are developed only for purposes of deriving na-
tional  estimates.  Additionally,  the  information  is  woefully  inadequate  for  making
strategic  decisions  regarding  feedstock,  market  and  system  management.  Current
EPA e-waste management efforts focus on:

1. number and weight of products that become obsolete
2. amount of electronic products that are recycled or disposed of
3. amount of electronic equipment that is stock-piled
4. collection rates of current electronics recycling programs, and
5. export of electronic material

The development of a more sustainable e-waste management system is contingent
on  the  quality  of  data  available  for  decision-making  purposes.  Consequently,  devel-
opment  of  a  more  complete,  accurate  and  useful  data  collection  and  management
system  is  paramount  to  establishing  a  more  sustainable  e-waste  management  sys-
tem. Examples of additional data needed to support an effective system include the
following:

1. Where the waste originated/how far it traveled
2. User information (personal, commercial, industrial, etc.)
3. Manufacturer name
4. Model numbers
5. Serial numbers
6. Product type (TV, monitor, CPU, etc.)
7. Product age
8. Product service life
9. Reason for discarding (e.g., obsolete, damaged, software issues, etc.)

This  information  could  be  combined  with  other  pertinent  databases  associated
with  product  information  (e.g.,  model  numbers  could  be  cross-referenced  with  spe-
cific  parts  lists)  and  demographic  information  (e.g.,  census,  Thomas  Registry,  etc.)
to  create  a  comprehensive  database  that  would  be  extremely  valuable  for  users  in-
terested  both  in  the  quality  of  the  products  they  produce,  availability  of  reusable
components, and methods for remanufacturing, reusing and recycling them.
Q1b. How  would  this  funding  effort  integrate  into  the  existing  overall  e-waste  strat-

egy?

A1b. U.S.  EPA  has  already  performed  cursory  analysis  of  the  problems  and  oppor-
tunities associated with electronic wastes. They have also developed some very basic
assistance  materials  for  helping  individuals  and  organizations  better  manage  elec-
tronic waste. This program would build on these efforts by providing the data collec-
tion, research, education, and technical assistance means necessary to fully develop
and  implement  a  more  sustainable  system  for  producing  and  managing  electronic

devices.  It  is  envisioned  that  such  a  system  would  minimize  waste,  pollution,  and
safety  hazards  while  maximizing  opportunities  for  remanufacturing  and  recycling.
Q2. Many  of  you  discussed  what  we  should  do  for  electronic  waste  that  will  result
from  products  that  are  currently  being  sold  or  are  on  the  drawing  board.  What
do we do with all the orphan waste and products people still have stored in their
attics? How will research assist us in properly disposing of this type of electronic
waste?

A2. People are keeping these systems in their attics or basements for an estimated
three to four years. This is a waste of the resources invested in this equipment. Re-
search  will  help  us  to  understand  the  reasons  that  people  store  this  equipment  so
long.  Our  current  guess  is  that  people  are  afraid  to  get  rid  of  this  equipment  for
fear of their personal information being misused or that they would be contributing
to a growing environmental problem. Understanding these problems and addressing
the needs will help use get equipment sooner and allow us greater reuse opportuni-
ties.  Better  identification  of  the  items  and  materials  that  comprise  the  current
waste stream will better enable us too safely and cost effectively process this equip-
ment.
Q3. What components are best suited for reuse? Do enough of these components exist
to  create  a  stable  supply  of  sufficient  quantity?  Would  high  reuse  and  recycling
greater standardization of component circuitry? What effects would the use of re-
claimed components have on industry warrantees and hardware support?

A3. Solid  state  components  are  best  suited  for  reuse.  They  also  happen  to  be  the
items that require the most resources for their initial production. I have been work-
ing around computers for the last 15 years and last month was the first time I ever
saw  a  solid  state  component  physically  fail.  Yes  there  is  more  than  enough  equip-
ment  to  create  a  stable  supply.  Component  circuitry  is  highly  standardized  by  gen-
eration, but the generational turn over is very rapid. While there may be 1,000 dif-
ferent  computer  model  on  the  market  at  any  give  moment  there  may  be  only  100
different  components.  I  believe  that  reuse  of  reclaimed  components  would  have  no
effect  on  industry  warrantees  and  hardware  support.  My  program  offers  a  three
year hardware warranty on our three- to four-year-old refurbished computers.
Q4. How can changes in software design reduce e-waste?
A4. To  date  most  software  design  has  been  about  increasing  functionality.  As  soft-
ware design matures more emphasis will be placed on efficiency. More efficient soft-
ware will require less powerful hardware and allow people to keep using their hard-
ware  longer.  This  can  be  seen  in  the  beta  testing  of  the  new  Microsoft  Windows  7
operating system.
Q5. Some  computers  are  too  old  to  be  refurbished  for  general  computing  task.  Are
there customers for components from these computers? What is the quality of the
hardware in these very old systems and what uses can they be put to?

A5. The quality of these ‘‘very old’’ systems is very good. Proper quality control test-
ing  can  identify  week  parts  and  eliminate  them  from  production.  We  are  just  now
learning  the  different  ways  to  use  this  equipment.  My  company  is  investigating
ways  that  homeowners  and  businesses  can  use  e-waste  to  help  reduce  their  energy
consumption. The smart grid will provide a vast amount of opportunities to monitor
and control energy use that our current ‘‘dumb’’ electrical grid does not.

Refurbishing computers educates, creates local jobs, is cost effective and helps the
environment.  I  believe  that  we  could  provide  refurbished  computers  for  the  upcom-
ing  census  at  a  significantly  reduced  cost  per  unit  with  out  sacrificing  any  needed
capabilities  or  quality.  In  fact  using  refurbished  computers  would  more  effectively
stimulate  the  U.S.  economy  because  all  of  the  money  spent  on  refurbishment  is  for
U.S.  jobs  where  as  80  percent  to  90  percent  of  the  money  spent  on  new  equipment
is for overseas manufacturing jobs.
Q6. What is your definition of ‘‘toxic’’ and ‘‘hazardous materials’’? Is the goal of com-

plete elimination of these materials realistic?

A6. My  definitions  of  ‘‘toxic’’  and  ‘‘hazardous  materials’’  are  materials  that  can
cause  harm  to  people  and  the  environment.  I  think  it  is  important  to  distinguish
between  equipment  that  contain  toxic  or  hazardous  materials  but  do  not  pose  any
risk of exposure during the use of the equipment. The most concerning issue around
electronic  equipment  is  its  manufacturing  and  disposal.  Modern  methods  of  major
manufactures  are  fundamentally  safe.  Real  concern  occurs  when  informal  process
such  as  burning  are  used.  I  believe  that  we  need  to  research  safely  processing  this

equipment  rather  than  eliminating  substances  of  concern  from  the  equipment  be-
cause I believe it is unrealistic to eliminate them.
Q7. Your  testimony  mentions  that  computers  from  one  manufacture  are  older  that
the  stream  as  a  whole.  Have  other  recyclers  seen  the  same  phenomena  and  if
so are there specific lessons to be drawn from this manufacture’s designs? Addi-
tionally,  this  manufacturer  has  been  criticized  for  creating  products  that  are
particularly  difficult  to  disassemble  and  recycle.  Are  there  trade-offs  between
longer use and recyclability?

A7. I  know  of  no  other  Refurbisher/Recycler  that  has  quantitative  data  on  this
issue. There are very valuable lessons to be learned from these differences. I believe
one of the major benefits to this kind of research is that it will increase the product
quality  for  the  industry  as  a  whole.  I  do  not  believe  that  there  are  inherent  trade-
offs between longer use and recyclability rather I think they go hand-in-hand.

STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MIKE THOMPSON (D–CA)

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  comment  briefly  on  electronic  waste,  or  ‘‘e-
waste.’’  I  appreciate  Chairman  Gordon  and  Ranking  Member  Ralph  Hall  allowing
me  to  be  a  part  of  this  hearing  on  e-waste,  a  subject  I’ve  been  involved  with  since
I  was  first  elected  to  Congress.  I  also  applaud  the  Chairman  and  the  Committee’s
continued work and interest on this critical issue of our age.

As  you  know  already,  electronic  products  are  becoming  smaller  and  lighter,  but
they  also  are  creating  an  ever-growing  environmental  and  waste  disposal  problem.
That’s because it’s often cheaper and more convenient to buy a new PC or cell phone
than  to  upgrade  an  old  one.  Today,  the  average  lifespan  of  a  computer  is  only  two
years  and  Americans  are  disposing  of  3,000  tons  of  computers  each  day.  These  dis-
carded items, more often than not, wind up in the landfills of developing countries,
where  the  waste  becomes  not  just  an  environmental  issue  but  a  moral  one  as  well.
A recent GAO report, ‘‘E-Waste: EPA Needs to Better Control Harmful U.S. Exports
through  Stronger  Enforcement  and  More  Comprehensive  Regulation,’’  found  that
most  e-waste  exported  from  the  U.S.  is  dismantled  under  unsafe  conditions,  using
methods like open-air incineration and acid baths to extract component metals.

The  legislative  language  you  consider  today,  including  grant  programs  to  spur
studies  into  making  electronic  equipment  easier  to  recycle  on  the  front  end  and
training our nation’s engineers in ‘‘green design,’’ will lay a critical piece of the foun-
dation for comprehensive e-waste legislation in the future. Truly an ounce of preven-
tion  is  worth  a  pound  of  cure;  if  obsolete  computers  and  other  such  items  can  be
diverted from the waste stream at the outset, half the battle will have already been
won.

Thank  you  again  for  bringing  much  needed  attention  to  this  issue  and  to  allow
us  to  gather  expert  testimony  on  the  problem  of  e-waste.  I  look  forward  to  working
with you further to enact a comprehensive plan to reduce e-waste.
