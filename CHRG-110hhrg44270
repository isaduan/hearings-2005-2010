U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

The Next Generation Air Transportation

System: Status and Issues

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 2008

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On Thursday, September 11, 2008 at 10:00 am, the Committee on Science & Tech-
nology will hold a hearing to examine the status of the Next Generation Air Trans-
portation System initiative known as NextGen and explore key issues related to the
initiative  and  the  interagency  Joint  Planning  and  Development  Office  (JPDO),  the
organization entrusted with NextGen planning and research coordination.

Witnesses:
Ms.  Victoria  Cox,  Senior  Vice  President  for  NextGen  &  Operations  Planning,  Air
Traffic Organization, Federal Aviation Administration
Dr.  Gerald  L.  Dillingham,  Director,  Physical  Infrastructure  Issues,  Government

nology

BACKGROUND
Issues

The following issues are expected to be raised at the hearing:

• Have  the  specific  and  real  improvements  projected  to  be  gained  through
NextGen  been  well  defined,  are  they  realistic,  and  is  there  a  stakeholder  con-
sensus in support of them?

• What metrics should Congress use to evaluate the progress of the NextGen ini-

tiative?

incorporated 

the  ATC  system  been  adequately 

• In  light  of  the  extremely  complex  systems  engineering  challenge  facing  the
NextGen  initiative,  what  will  the  NextGen  interagency  partnership  and  other
stakeholders need to do to maximize its chances for success?
• Have  the  views  of  industry,  active  air  traffic  controllers,  and  technicians  who
maintain 
in  NextGen
foundational  planning  documents,  such  as  the  Concept  of  Operations,  Enter-
prise Architecture, and Integrated Work Plan?
• Have  the  research  and  development  (R&D)  expectations  established  by  Vision
100—the legislation establishing the framework for NextGen—been met by the
JPDO and its stakeholders?
• What  needs  to  be  done  to  move  the  JPDO  from  a  position  of  proposing  the
R&D  necessary  for  the  success  of  NextGen  to  one  of  articulating  a  clear  R&D
program  with  defined  and  prioritized  tasks  for  each  of  the  partner  agencies?
• How confident should Congress be that progress in meeting the research, devel-
opment and testing activities set out in the JPDO’s Integrated Work Plan will
provide  a  sufficient  basis  for  achieving  the  NextGen’s  goals  and  timetable  for
quieter, cleaner, and more efficient air traffic operations?
• Does  the  current  form  of  the  Integrated  Work  Plan  have  sufficient  detail  and
priorities to allow it to be effectively used to oversee and manage the NextGen-
related R&D efforts of multiple agencies?

• What  major  omissions  did  the  JPDO  find  when  it  performed  its  recent  re-
search gap analysis, and how are they being addressed? Did the gap analysis
indicate areas in which partners, other than the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion (FAA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), need
to play a greater role in furthering the NextGen initiative?
• What  has  to  happen  for  FAA  to  be  able  to  successfully  carry  out  its  intent  to
accelerate  the  transition  from  the  JPDO’s  system  concepts  and  R&D  activities
to  the  implementation  of  operational  systems  without  sacrificing  the  focus
needed  to  ensure  that  NextGen’s  long-term  benefits  of  increased  system  capac-
ity,  lower  energy  consumption,  and  reduced  environmental  impacts  will  be
achieved?
• Given the impact of aviation on the environment, including climate, what steps
• What assumptions regarding the maturity of near-term and long-term research
and technologies were made as part of the decision to reorganize NextGen and
JPDO in FAA?
• Can  the  JPDO  continue  to  be  viewed  as  an  ‘‘honest  broker’’  by  the  other  par-
• How  will  FAA  and  its  federal  partners  ensure  that  the  JPDO  and  NextGen
program adhere to budget and schedule milestones during the upcoming Presi-
dential transition? Will momentum and program focus be impacted by transi-
tion activities?

ticipating agencies in light of the recent restructuring action by FAA?

should the NextGen initiative take to mitigate that impact?

Overview

While  the  health  of  the  National  Airspace  System  (NAS)  is  critical  to  America’s
economy, the current approach to managing air transportation is becoming increas-
ingly  inefficient  and  operationally  obsolete.  Today’s  NAS  is  near  capacity,  with
delays growing to record levels, yet a threefold increase in air traffic is expected by
2025.  Current  processes  and  procedures  do  not  provide  the  flexibility  nor  the
scalability needed to meet the growing demand.

In  2003,  Congress  created  the  Joint  Planning  and  Development  Office  (JPDO)  as
part  of  P.L.  108–176,  Vision  100:  Century  of  Flight  Reauthorization  Act.  The  JPDO
is  to  plan  for  and  coordinate,  with  federal  and  non-federal  stakeholders,  a  trans-
formation  from  the  current  air  traffic  control  system  to  the  NextGen  by  2025.
NextGen is envisioned as a major redesign of the air transportation system that will
entail  precision  satellite  navigation;  digital,  networked  communications;  an  inte-
grated aviation weather system; layered, adaptive security; and more.

Seven organizations are participating in the JPDO: the Departments of Transpor-
tation,  Commerce,  Defense,  and  Homeland  Security;  FAA;  NASA;  and  the  White
House  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy.  The  JPDO  is  housed  within  FAA,
and  FAA’s  FY  2009  budget  request  includes  $19.5  million  to  support  JPDO.  While
the JPDO has the planning and development responsibility and can define R&D re-
quirements that it would like the participating agencies to carry out, it has neither
budgetary  nor  management  authority  over  the  agencies’  activities  in  support  of
NextGen.  Although  the  JPDO  is  responsible  for  planning  the  transformation  to
NextGen  and  coordinating  the  related  research  and  development  efforts  of  its  part-
ner  agencies,  FAA  is  largely  responsible  for  implementing  the  policies  and  systems
necessary for NextGen, while continuing to safely operate the current air traffic con-
trol system 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The  JPDO  envisions  that  NextGen  will  be  an  evolutionary  transformation  of  the
Nation’s air transportation system that integrates a combination of new procedures
and advances in technology to improve delivery of services to both civil and military
users. The goal of NextGen, as stated by the JPDO, is to ‘‘significantly increase the
safety, security, capacity, efficiency, and environmental compatibility of air transpor-
tation operations, and by doing so, to improve the overall economic well-being of the
country.’’  The  JPDO’s  role  is  to  establish  how  the  air  transportation  system  should
be  transformed.  Part  of  this  transformation  involves  integrating  and  reshaping  ca-
pabilities across all aspects of air transportation so that the entire system operates
as an interconnected structure.

The JPDO sees the investments in NextGen resulting in increased system capac-
ity  and  flexibility  to  accommodate  growing  demand  for  air  transportation  services
and diversity of flight profiles. In its planning documents, the JPDO describes build-
ing NextGen in three phases, which it characterizes as Epochs.

• In  Epoch  1  [Foundational  Capabilities  (2007–2011)],  focus  will  be  on  devel-
oping  and  implementing  mature  foundational  technologies  and  capabilities
such  as  Automatic  Dependent  Surveillance—Broadcast  (ADS–B)  which  is  the

surveillance  and  navigation  technology  that  will  serve  as  the  core  of  the
NextGen  system  by  delivering  more  timely  and  precise  information  to  the
cockpit while giving pilots and controllers a common operational picture.

• In Epoch 2 [Hybrid System (2012–2018)], the required automation and proce-
dures  are  implemented  to  allow  pilots  a  more  active  role  in  the  system
through self-separation, merging, and passing. According to the JPDO, by the
completion of Epoch 2, operational improvements and fleet evolution will pro-
vide  a  number  of  environmental  benefits  such  as  increased  fuel  efficiency  at
34  FAA-designated  airports  within  the  continental  United  States.  For  exam-
ple,  in  the  terminal  airspace  operations  area,  NextGen  capabilities  and  im-
provements  in  aircraft  engine  technologies  will,  according  to  the  JPDO,
produce  an  overall  improvement  in  fuel  efficiency  estimated  at  six  percent
compared  to  the  baseline.  This  will  have  a  commensurate  positive  effect  on
reducing the level of emissions generated.

• The JPDO views Epoch 3 [NextGen Operations (2019–2025)] as the expansion
of  NextGen  into  a  nationwide  system  which  also  allows  for  more  complex,
high-density  operations  across  the  system  to  take  full  advantage  of  the  air-
space  and  the  precision  provided  by  satellite-based  technologies  that  will  be
fully deployed by then.

NextGen Funding

Preliminary  benefits  analyses  by  the  JPDO  indicate  that  NextGen  capacity  in-
creases  could  yield  significant  economic  growth.  As  stated  in  its  Business  Case  re-
leased  in  August  2007,1 using  data  derived  from  the  joint  FAA/NASA  2004  Socio-
economic Demand Forecast (SEDF) study on aviation demand, the JPDO estimated
‘‘a rough-order-of-magnitude annual economic value of $3,000 per flight. Every addi-
tional  flight  accommodated  by  expected  NextGen  capacity  gains  represented  an  eco-
nomic  benefit,  whereas  every  additional  flight  that  cannot  be  accommodated  rep-
resented  an  economic  loss.’’  The  JPDO  found  that  ‘‘preliminary  results  from  the
SEDF study indicate that the cumulative positive impact to consumer surplus result-
ing from estimated NextGen capacity gains is expected to be up to $80 billion by the
end  of  Epoch  2  (2018)  and  as  much  as  $176  billion  by  the  end  of  Epoch  3  (2025).’’
The  JPDO  notes  that  these  benefits  are  not  achievable  without  investments  by  the
government  and  industry:  Initial  estimates  of  the  FAA  investment  required  to
achieve the NextGen benefits are projected at $15 billion to $22 billion through 2025
and  preliminary  investment  estimates  by  the  aviation  industry  are  projected  to  be
in the range of $14 billion to $20 billion during this same time frame.2

NextGen  investment  over  the  next  five  years  (from  FY09  to  FY13)  including  Re-
search  and  Development  is  currently  projected  by  the  JPDO  to  total  over  $7.2  bil-
lion. Requested budgets by partner agencies for FY09 total $978.5 million. NextGen
investments for FY08 through FY13 are shown in Table 1.

It  should  be  noted  that  to  date,  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  and  Depart-
ment  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  have  not  identified  specific  NextGen-related  in-
vestments in their out-year budgets.

Uniquely establishing NextGen Research and Development costs4 requires adding
FAA’s  System  Development  activities  funded  in  the  agency’s  Capital  Account  to
agencies’ activities characterized as RE&D or R&D. Doing so shows that NextGen’s
projected  Research  and  Development  costs  in  the  next  five  years  are  projected  to
total  over  $2.2  billion;  requested  budgets  for  NextGen  Research  and  Development
activities  by  partner  agencies  for  FY09  total  $384.3  million.  The  NextGen  R&D  ac-
tivities from FY09 through FY13 are shown below in Table 2.

4 The R&D costs in this table are components already included in the Table 1.

Realignment of NextGen Activities and Responsibilities in FAA

FAA  recently  realigned  its  NextGen  activities  and  modified  JPDO’s  position  and
status  within  the  FAA.  Organizationally,  the  agency  added  a  Senior  Vice  President
for  NextGen  and  Operations  Planning  to  the  Air  Traffic  Organization  (ATO).  Argu-
ing  that  the  change  would  give  FAA  ‘‘a  clear  decision-maker  and  a  distinct  line  of
authority  on  issues  relating  to  NextGen,’’  the  FAA  Acting  Administrator  designated
Ms.  Victoria  Cox  as  the  Senior  Vice  President  responsible  for  NextGen  and  Oper-
ations  Planning.  [Ms.  Cox,  one  of  the  hearing  witnesses,  will  be  able  to  provide  an
update on the status of this realignment.]

Prior to the recent realignment, the JPDO, which has always been housed in the
FAA,  reported  to  FAA’s  Administrator  and  the  Chief  Operating  Officer  of  ATO.
Today,  the  JPDO  reports  to  the  Senior  Vice  President  for  NextGen  and  Operations
Planning,  one  of  four  Senior  Vice  Presidents  in  the  ATO  structure  headed  by  the
Chief  Operating  Officer  and  no  longer  reports  directly  to  the  FAA  Administrator.
This  restructuring  is  contrary  to  the  intent  of  the  House-passed  FAA  Reauthoriza-
tion  bill  [H.R.  2881],  which  envisions  having  the  head  of  the  JPDO  report  directly
to  the  FAA  Administrator  and  be  a  voting  member  of  FAA’s  Joint  Resources  Coun-
cil. The new ATO structure is shown on the following chart.

In  addition  to  the  JPDO,  the  Senior  Vice  President  for  NextGen  and  Operations
Planning  has  purview  over  Operations  Planning  as  well  as  the  newly  established
NextGen  Integration  and  Implementation  Office.  According  to  FAA,  the  JPDO  will
maintain/revise  the  Integrated  Work  Plan;  ‘‘maintain  the  vision  of  the  future’’  and
produce ‘‘a long-term R&D Plan/Roadmap that demonstrates alignment across part-
ner  agencies  performing  long-term  research’’;  and  facilitate  interagency  cooperation.
For  its  part,  the  newly  formed  Integration  and  Implementation  Office  has  been
tasked  to  ‘‘ensure  effective  and  efficient  application,  planning,  programming,  budg-
eting and execution of FAA’s NextGen portfolio and manage NextGen portfolio across
FAA  lines  of  business.’’  Responsibility  for  the  execution  of  individual  acquisitions,
such  as  Automatic  Dependence  Surveillance  Broadcast  (ADS–B),  and  System  Wide
Information  Management  (SWIM)  would  remain  in  operational  units.  The  ATO  or-
ganization  and  the  units  reporting  to  the  Senior  Vice  President  for  NextGen  and
Operations Planning are shown on the next page.

Aviation and the Environment

The NextGen initiative has, from the onset, recognized the need to consider avia-
tion’s  impact  on  the  environment.  This  is  because  environmental  effects,  such  as
noise  level  near  airports  and  effects  of  aircraft  emissions  on  local  air  quality,  are
known  capacity  limiters.  Furthermore,  aviation’s  contribution  to  climate  change  is
becoming a major topic.

In  his  prepared  statement  presented  at  a  hearing  before  the  Space  and  Aero-
nautics  Subcommittee  in  March  2007  on  FAA’s  R&D  Budget  Priorities  for  Fiscal
Year  2008,  Dr.  Donald  Wuebbles,  Chair  of  a  workshop  on  the  impacts  of  aviation
on climate change (jointly sponsored by the JPDO’s Environmental Integrated Prod-
uct  Team  and  the  Partnership  for  Air  Transportation  Noise  and  Emissions  Reduc-
tion Center of Excellence) summarized the findings and conclusions of his workshop
as follows:

‘‘As  a  key  conclusion,  the  workshop  participants  acknowledged  an  urgent  need
for  aviation-focused  research  activities  to  address  the  uncertainties  and  gaps  in
the  understanding  of  current  and  projected  impacts  of  aviation  on  climate  and
to develop metrics to better characterize these impacts. This effort will entail co-
ordination  with  existing  and  planned  climate  research  programs  within  govern-
ment  agencies,  and  could  be  organized  through  expansion  of  such  programs  or
by  totally  new  activities.  The  workshop  participants  indicated  that  such  efforts
should  include  strong  and  continuing  interactions  among  the  science  and  avia-
tion communities as well as among policy-makers to develop well-informed deci-
sions. The next steps required include further ranking and prioritizing of identi-
fied  research  needs;  creating  a  research  roadmap  with  associated  roles  and  re-
sponsibilities of various participating agencies and stakeholders; and identifying
resources needed to implement the roadmap.’’

In addition, GAO testified before the House Committee on Transportation and In-
frastructure’s  Subcommittee  on  Aviation  in  March  2008  [GAO–08–706T]  and  said:
‘‘Aviation  contributes  a  modest  but  growing  proportion  of  total  U.S.  emissions,
and these emissions contribute to adverse health and environmental effects. Air-
craft  and  airport  operations,  including  those  of  service  and  passenger  vehicles,
emit  ozone  and  other  substances  that  contribute  to  local  air  pollution,  as  well
as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.
EPA estimates that aviation emissions account for less than one percent of local

air pollution nationwide and about 2.7 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions,
but these emissions are expected to grow as air traffic increases.’’

The JDPO and its partners believe that there are uncertainties in our present un-
derstanding  of  the  magnitude  of  climate  impacts  due  to  aviation  emissions.  In  its
most  recent  assessment,  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC),
a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) and by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has estimated
that aviation in 2005 accounted for about three percent of worldwide anthropogenic
radiative forcing. Because growth in demand is expected over the next few decades,
the  JPDO  has  identified  the  urgent  need  to  understand  and  quantify  the  potential
impacts of aviation emissions in its research program.

Such  urgency  is  also  needed  in  light  of  steps  by  the  European  Union  (EU)  to  in-
clude both domestic and international aviation in an emissions trading scheme. The
congressionally-directed  report  Aviation  and  the  Environment,  A  National  Vision
Statement,  Framework  for  Goals  and  Recommended  Actions  that  was  prepared  by
the Partnership for Air Transportation Noise and Emissions Reduction (PARTNER)
in 2004 [Professor Ian Waitz, one of the hearing witnesses, participated in the study
and may be able to provide additional details] said:

‘‘The concerns extend well beyond American shores. For example, within the Eu-
ropean Union (EU) the climate impacts of aviation are identified as the most sig-
nificant  adverse  impact  of  aviation,  in  contrast  to  the  United  States  and  many
other  nations  where  air  quality  and  noise  are  the  current  focus  of  attention.  As
a result, there are increasing EU calls for regulation-trading, taxes and charges,
demand  management  and  reduced  reliance  on  aviation-even  though  there  is
large  uncertainty  in  the  understanding  of  the  climate  effects  of  aircraft  and  ap-
propriate means to mitigate these effects. Despite the importance of this issue, the
United  States  does  not  have  a  significant  research  program  to  assess  the  poten-
tial  impacts  of  aviation  on  climate.  This  may  put  the  United  States  at  a  dis-
advantage in evaluating technological, operational and policy options, and in ne-
gotiating  appropriate  regulations  and  standards  with  other  nations.  The  inter-
national concerns will continue to grow with the strong increase in air transpor-
tation demand anticipated for Asia.’’

According  to  GAO,  the  emissions  trading  scheme  involves  a  ‘‘cap  and  trade’’  sys-
tem  that  sets  allowances  for  greenhouse  gas  emissions  for  industries  and  other
sources.5 Parties that pollute below their allowance receive emissions credits, which
they  can  trade  in  a  market  to  other  parties  that  have  exceeded  their  allowance.  As
proposed,  the  EU’s  scheme  would  apply  to  air  carriers  flying  within  the  EU  and  to
carriers, including U.S. carriers, flying into and out of EU airports in 2012. For ex-
ample,  under  the  EU  proposal,  a  U.S.  airline’s  emissions  in  domestic  airspace  as
well as over the high seas would require permits if a flight landed or departed from
an  EU  airport.  Airlines  whose  aircraft  emit  carbon  dioxide  at  levels  exceeding  pre-
scribed allowances would be required to reduce their emissions or to purchase addi-
tional  allowances.  According  to  GAO,  although  the  EU’s  proposal  seeks  to  include
U.S.  airlines  within  the  emissions  trading  scheme,  FAA  and  industry  stakeholders
have argued that U.S. carriers would not legally be subject to the legislation.

Subcommittee  on  Space  and  Aeronautics’  March  2007  Hearing  On  Status

and Issues Related to the JPDO and NextGen

During the March 29, 2007 hearing held by the Subcommittee on Space and Aero-
nautics  on  the  status  and  issues  associated  with  JPDO  and  NextGen,  Mr.  Charles
Leader, Director of the JPDO, testified that two fundamental NextGen technologies
were just beginning implementation: Automatic Dependence Surveillance Broadcast
(ADS–B),  and  System  Wide  Information  Management  (SWIM)  and  mentioned  the
near-term  release  of  three  important  NextGen  documents:  the  Concept  of  Oper-
ations,  the  Enterprise  Architecture,  and  the  Integrated  Work  Plan.  Dr.  Gerald
Dillingham  from  GAO  discussed  the  JPDO’s  organizational  structure,  technical
planning, and research funding. He urged the JPDO to involve all stakeholders, in-
cluding active traffic controllers and technicians. Mr. John Douglass, then the Presi-
dent  and  CEO  of  the  Aerospace  Industries  Association,  noted  that  industry  was  an
essential  partner  in  NextGen  and  that  it  is  important  for  industry  to  have  con-
fidence  in  the  government’s  commitment  to  NextGen.  Dr.  Bruce  Carmichael,  Direc-
tor,  Aviation  Applications  Program,  Research  Applications  Laboratory,  National
Center  for  Atmospheric  Research  stated  that  seventy  percent  of  delays  in  today’s

system  are  attributable  to  weather  and  that  NextGen  will  integrate  the  weather
programs of the FAA, DOD and NOAA.

Progress in Completing Key Foundational Documents

At the March 2007 hearing, the JPDO acknowledged that it had been working to
establish  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  between  its  participating  agen-
cies  since  at  least  August  2005  but  indicated  that  only  two  signatures  on  a  draft
MOU  had  been  secured  to  date.  Witnesses  at  that  hearing  supported  the  need  for
a signed MOU, one witness saying that the document needed to be in place to span
likely  changes  in  senior  management  and  another  witness  characterizing  the  MOU
as fundamental, in that without one, the delayed dialogue among entities ‘‘is almost
impossible  to  put  into  any  rational  context.’’  It  was  not  until  June  9,  2008  that  the
MOU was finally signed by all five agencies.

Three  key  planning  documents  were  released  by  the  JPDO  subsequent  to  last
year’s  hearing.  These  documents  form  the  NextGen  baseline  plan:  the  Concept  of
Operations  (Version  2.0),  released  June  13,  2007;  the  Enterprise  Architecture
(Version  2.0),  released  June  22,  2007;  and  the  Integrated  Work  Plan  (Version  0.2),
released February 15, 2008. The Research Plan, released August 31, 2007, has since
been incorporated into the Integrated Work Plan.

The  Concept  of  Operations  document  is  the  most  fundamental  and  explains  how
the system will work and what it will look like. The JPDO states that this is impor-
tant in developing the structure, policy, and procedures, and the changes needed to
make  the  system  a  reality.  The  Enterprise  Architecture  document  is  a  highly  tech-
nical description of the NextGen system. According to the JPDO, it is meant to pro-
vide  a  common  tool  for  planning  and  understanding  the  interrelated  systems  that
make up NextGen. As such, the Enterprise Architecture serves as a guide in coordi-
nating R&D activities and developing JPDO’s future needs for research and capital
investment. The Integrated Work Plan provides the research, policy and regulation,
and acquisition timelines necessary to achieve NextGen by 2025.

External Reviews of NextGen and JPDO

There  have  been  several  recent  independent  reviews  on  the  progress  of  NextGen
and  JPDO’s  activities  subsequent  to  the  March  2007  hearing  held  by  the  Sub-
committee  on  Space  and  Aeronautics.  Some  of  the  key  findings  and  recommenda-
tions of those reviews are as follows:

Government Accountability Office

Dr.  Gerald  Dillingham  of  the  GAO  testified  on  May  9,  2007  before  the  House
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure’s Subcommittee on Aviation [GAO–
07–784T] on the status of the NextGen initiative [Dr. Dillingham, one of the hearing
witnesses,  participated  in  the  study  and  will  be  able  to  provide  an  update].  Some
of the main points made by Dr. Dillingham were as follows:

• ‘‘JPDO  has  continued  to  make  progress  in  furthering  its  key  planning  docu-
ments. JPDO has experienced delays in the release of key documents, but cur-
rently plans to have initial versions of these documents released by July 2007.
JPDO  has  been  working  since  2005  to  establish  a  memorandum  of  under-
standing between its partner agencies, although as of May 4, 2007, the memo-
randum had been signed by the Departments of Transportation and Commerce
and  NASA,  but  was  not  yet  signed  by  the  Departments  of  Defense  and  Home-
land Security.’’

• ‘‘FAA  and  JPDO  continue  to  face  a  number  of  challenges  in  moving  toward
NextGen, including questions about FAA’s technical and contract management
expertise;  FAA’s  ability  to  maintain  a  number  of  existing  systems,  including
monitoring and addressing equipment outages to ensure the safety of these ex-
isting  systems  as  it  transitions  to  NextGen;  and  conducting  necessary  human
factors research.’’

• ‘‘In  addition,  while  JPDO  recently  estimated  that  the  total  federal  cost  for
NextGen  infrastructure  through  2025  will  range  between  $15  billion  and  $22
billion,  questions  remain  about  which  entities  will  fund  and  conduct  the  nec-
essary  research,  development,  and  demonstration  projects  that  will  be  key  to
achieving certain NextGen capabilities.’’

• ‘‘Also,  JPDO  faces  a  continuing  challenge  in  ensuring  the  involvement  of  all
key  stakeholders,  such  as  active  air  traffic  controllers  and  system  technicians,
in its NextGen planning efforts.’’

In providing answers for the record for that same hearing, GAO responded [GAO–
07–928R]  to  a  question  from  Chairman  Costello  on  the  extent  to  which  moving  the
JPDO out of the FAA’s Air Traffic Organization (ATO) would give the JPDO greater
visibility and authority, and the potential pluses and minuses of such a move. GAO
said:

• ‘‘Currently, JPDO is located within FAA and reports to both the FAA Adminis-
trator  and  the  Chief  Operating  Officer  of  ATO.  In  GAO’s  view,  JPDO  should
not be moved out of FAA.’’
• ‘‘However,  JPDO’s  dual  reporting  status  hinders  its  ability  to  interact  on  an
equal  footing  with  ATO  and  the  other  partner  agencies.  On  one  hand,  JPDO
must  counter  the  perception  that  it  is  a  proxy  for  the  ATO  and,  as  such,  is
not able to act as an ‘‘honest broker.’’ On the other hand, JPDO must continue
to  work  with  ATO  and  its  partner  agencies  in  a  partnership  in  which  ATO
is  the  lead  implementer  of  NextGen.  Therefore,  it  is  important  for  JPDO  to
have  some  independence  from  ATO.  One  change  that  could  begin  to  address
this  issue  would  be  to  have  the  JPDO  Director  report  directly  to  the  FAA  Ad-
ministrator. This change may also lessen what some stakeholders now perceive
as unnecessary bureaucracy and red tape associated with decision-making and
other JPDO and NextGen processes.’’
• ‘‘As a part of any change in the dual reporting status of JPDO’s Director, con-
sideration could be given to the possibility of creating the position of Associate
Administrator of NextGen and elevating the JPDO Director to that post.’’
• ‘‘One  plus  or  advantage  of  moving  JPDO  out  of  ATO  is  that  it  could  raise
JPDO’s  authority  and  visibility  in  interagency  deliberations  by  putting  JPDO
on  an  equal  footing  with  ATO  and  other  FAA  lines  of  business.  For  example,
moving  JPDO  out  of  ATO  might  strengthen  its  linkages  to  the  Department  of
Defense (DOD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In addition,
JPDO  may  be  able  to  work  more  effectively  with  other  FAA  lines  of  business,
such as Airports, for which JPDO has planning responsibilities. For example,
JPDO is responsible for developing plans to increase airport capacity. A minus
or disadvantage of moving JPDO out of ATO is that because much of the work
related  to  implementing  NextGen  must  occur  under  ATO,  this  work  could  be
harder to accomplish.’’

GAO  also  reported  to  the  Subcommittee  on  Space  and  Aeronautics  earlier  this
year on noise and other environmental impacts of aviation that may fundamentally
constrain air transportation in the 21st century [GAO–08–384]. GAO said that FAA
and NASA have aligned their aviation noise R&D plans through a number of plan-
ning  and  coordinating  mechanisms  in  order  to  ensure  that  these  plans  are  com-
plementary  and  contribute  to  goals  for  addressing  the  environmental  impacts  of
aviation, particularly as these impacts relate to the implementation of NextGen.

Department of Transportation Office of the Inspector General

On April 14, 2008, the DOT’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) released a re-
port [AV–2008–049] on how FAA’s air traffic control projects are impacted by plans
for  NextGen  [Mr.  Calvin  Scovel,  DOT’s  Inspector  General  and  one  of  the  hearing
witnesses,  participated  in  the  study  and  will  be  able  to  provide  additional  details].
Some  of  the  main  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  OIG  study  were  as  follows:

Findings

• ‘‘Much work remains to determine NextGen’s impact on existing projects. FAA
is currently exploring ways to accelerate elements of NextGen. FAA faces com-
plex  integration  issues  (linking  new  and  legacy  systems)  and  must  manage
interdependency among diverse projects. The pace of introducing new automa-
tion, more flexible airspace, and data-link communications will be governed by
the pace of existing projects.’’
• ‘‘Over  the  next  two  years,  over  23  critical  decisions  must  be  made  about  ongo-
ing  programs.  These  decisions  affect  major  lines  of  the  modernization  effort
with  respect  to  automation  (modernizing  terminal  and  en  route  capabilities),
communications (moving forward with data-link programs), navigation (decid-
ing  whether  to  retain  or  discontinue  certain  ground-based  systems),  and  sur-
veillance  (using  satellite-based  and  radar  information  with  existing  ATC  sys-
tems).’’
• ‘‘These  decisions  and  many  others  will  depend  heavily  on  the  development  of
a  comprehensive  Enterprise  Architecture  (a  technical  roadmap)  that  lays  out
the vision of how the system will work and what changes will be required. The

13

Enterprise Architecture must establish a transition path that identifies the role
and evolution of current systems and how they will transition to NextGen.’’

• ‘‘FAA  has  made  progress  in  developing  the  NextGen  Enterprise  Architecture,
but planning documents lack details on requirements, particularly for automa-
tion,  that  could  be  used  to  develop  reliable  cost  estimates.  FAA  must  revise
these  documents  to  prioritize  NextGen  operational  improvements  and  systems
and  ensure  that  these  priorities  are  reflected  in  NextGen  planning  documents
and budget requests.’’

• ‘‘Along with refining the Enterprise Architecture, FAA must chart a clear tran-
sition course from the current NAS architecture to the vastly different NextGen
environment.  Our  work  shows  that  FAA  needs  to  conduct  a  gap  analysis  be-
tween  the  current  system  and  the  NextGen  architecture  planned  for  the  2025
timeframe.  This  will  help  establish  budget  priorities,  better  define  require-
ments,  and  refine  transition  plans.  In  addition,  FAA  needs  to  develop  an  in-
terim  architecture  or  ‘‘way-point’’  that  is  manageable  and  executable  for  what
is expected of the NAS by 2015. Until these steps are taken, it will not be pos-
sible  to  determine  technical  requirements  that  translate  into  reliable  cost  and
schedule estimates for existing or future acquisitions.’’

Recommendations

• ‘‘Develop  and  report  on  a  new  set  of  metrics  for  measuring  progress  with
NextGen initiatives that focus on the delivery of a new capability with respect
to  enhancing  capacity,  boosting  productivity,  or  reducing  Agency  operating
costs.’’

• ‘‘Complete a gap analysis of the NAS enterprise architecture that closely exam-
ines current systems (the ‘‘as is’’) and the planned NextGen enterprise architec-
ture (the ‘‘to be’’) and develop and establish priorities.’’

• ‘‘Once  the  gap  analysis  is  completed,  develop  an  interim  architecture  that  de-
tails what can be accomplished in the 2015 timeframe that will allow FAA to
more accurately determine costs and other factors required for NextGen.’’

• ‘‘Use the interim architecture as the basis for an integrated program plan that
establishes  an  executable  program  for  the  NextGen  capabilities.  This  effort
should  include  detailed  cost,  schedule,  requirements,  acquisition  strategies,
risk  management,  and  the  supporting  organizational  structures  to  execute  the
integrated program.’’

At an exit conference with FAA officials from ATO and JPDO, those officials gen-
erally concurred with all of the OIG’s recommendations, including the need to estab-
lish metrics for measuring progress with NextGen initiatives and develop an interim
architecture for NextGen.

National  Academies  Workshop  on  Assessing  the  Research  and  Development  Plan  for

the Next Generation Air Transportation System

On April 1 and 2, 2008, a workshop was led by the National Academies’ National
Research  Council  to  gather  reactions  to  the  research  and  development  aspects  of
JPDO’s  baseline  Integrated  Work  Plan  (IWP).  The  workshop  was  composed  of  ex-
perts  from  JPDO,  session  moderators,  members  of  the  workshop  organizing  com-
mittee,  and  invited  guests  from  government,  industry,  and  academia  who  were  fa-
miliar with air traffic management. Although the workshop was not a consensus ac-
tivity, a number of issues were raised by the participants in the workshop. As indi-
cated in the pre-publication copy of a summary of the workshop, these included:

• ‘‘The issue of a sensed lack of urgency on the part of the JPDO was mentioned
most  often  by  workshop  participants.  There  clearly  are  economic  pressures  to
move  quickly  and  the  rest  of  the  international  aviation  world  is  moving  for-
ward, particularly in Europe. However, the JPDO is still proposing R&D that
needs to be done rather than articulating a clear program. ‘‘

• ‘‘A  second  issue  raised  by  many  of  the  participants  was  the  JPDO’s  inability
to  articulate  the  goals  of  the  NextGen  program.  The  JPDO  outlined  a  large
number of excellent research tasks in its presentations, most of which will like-
ly  be  required  to  support  future  U.S.  airspace  system  needs.  However,  many
participants  felt  that  there  was  a  lack  of  focus  on  the  most  important  future
needs: airspace and airport capacity.’’

• ‘‘Tied  to  the  concern  about  the  lack  of  clearly  stated  goals  is  the  concern  that
prioritization  of  the  individual  pieces  of  the  program  has  not  been  done.  It  is

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:09 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 044270 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\091108\44270 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

14

important to consider how best to spend limited research dollars and to deter-
mine the likely payoff for particular investments.’’

• ‘‘During the workshop, several participants expressed concern with the narrow
boundaries  and  inward  focus  (at  FAA  and  NASA)  of  the  NextGen  R&D  pro-
gram. Participants suggested that a number of connections needed to be made
or  strengthened  with  other  constituents,  such  as  airport  authorities,  control-
lers, local communities, industry, DOD, and international organizations.’’

• ‘‘Most participants also felt that the IWP [Integrated Work Plan] was not well-
structured  from  the  research  perspective  and  stressed  that  the  document
should  make  research  priorities  clear.  However,  these  and  other  participants
felt  that  the  current  draft  IWP  contains  too  much  unprioritized  detail  and  is
not  properly  detailed  to  plan  what  research  needs  to  be  done.  Further,  other
participants felt the IWP does not appear to be the most effective way to over-
see or manage the research.’’

• ‘‘Concerns  were  raised  by  many  participants  that  there  may  not  be  sufficient
resources  to  enable  development  of  these  transition  paths.  First,  it  was  not
clear how the activity is being financed. That is, it was not clear to the partici-
pants  who  is  ultimately  responsible  for  paying  for  the  R&D  needed  to  get  to
implementation of the program.’’

• ‘‘The last key issue centered on political difficulties. Foremost among the work-
shop participants was the concern about the challenge of making difficult (po-
litically  charged)  decisions.  Government  agencies  tend  to  be  risk-averse,  and
some  participants  feel  that  the  lack  of  decision-making  is  holding  up  the
JPDO’s ability to move forward on NextGen’s research needs. A number of spe-
cific  issues  were  identified  that  are  difficult,  but  which  participants  felt  will
need  to  be  addressed.  For  example,  some  participants  raised  the  question  of
how  to  deal  with  the  issue  that  although  manufacturers  are  willing  to  invest
in  changes  desired  for  environmental  improvements,  airlines  are  not  willing
to  pay  the  additional  costs;  that  is,  there  is  an  issue  of  the  trade-off  between
outcome and cost constraints.’’

FAA’s Proposed Rule on ADS–B

Last  October,  FAA  issued  a  Notice  of  Proposed  Rule-making  (NPRM)  regarding
the  agency’s  transition  plan  to  the  Automatic  Dependent  Surveillance-Broadcast
(ADS–B)  system,  a  key  foundation  for  NextGen.  FAA’s  planned  implementation
would  require  installing  ADS–B  on  all  aircraft  operating  in  U.S.  airspace  by  2020.
According  to  media  reports,  the  proposed  rule  garnered  more  than  300  comments,
some  centering  on  the  fact  that  mandated  equipment  on  board  aircraft  would  pro-
vide  only  the  ADS–B  ‘‘out’’  service,  where  signals  transmitted  out  (identification,
GPS  position,  altitude,  heading,  speed  and  other  data  once  per  second)  would  be
used  primarily  by  the  air  traffic  control  system.  Pilots  would  not  be  provided  with
information  about  other  traffic  around  them,  a  capability  available  only  with  ADS–
B  ‘‘in’’  equipment,  the  addition  of  which  was  not  mandated  by  the  proposed  rule.
Aircraft  equipage  of  ADS–B  ‘‘in’’  and  cockpit  displays  was  optional.  It  has  been  re-
ported that some operators view the mandated equipage as providing them little or
no benefit, although they acknowledge improvement to controller provided informa-
tion.

According to media reports, FAA has asked the Aviation Rule-making Committee
(ARC)  to  perform  an  NPRM  review.  Subsequent  to  the  ARC’s  report  and  rec-
ommendations,  FAA  will  have  different  options  to  consider,  namely  deciding  that
the  NPRM  will  remain  unchanged,  modifying  it  to  incorporate  some  of  the  commit-
tee’s  recommendations  or  performing  a  complete  revision  of  the  proposed  rule  and
producing  a  supplemental  NPRM  (SNPRM)  to  replace  it.  No  date  has  been  estab-
lished  for  when  FAA  will  announce  its  choice  of  option.  It  is  likely  that  the  man-
dated equipage date for ADS–B will be delayed.

European Air Traffic Modernization and Associated Research and Develop-

ment Efforts

Last  year,  the  FAA  Administrator  signed  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  with
her  European  counterpart  that  formalizes  cooperation  between  the  NextGen  initia-
tive  and  the  ‘‘Single  European  Sky  Air  Traffic  Management  Research  Programme’’
or  SESAR  program,  the  European  equivalent  of  NextGen.  FAA  has  said  that  the
agency and the European Commission are identifying opportunities and establishing

said,  will  address  policy  issues  and  facilitate  global  agreement  within  international
standards organizations.

Compatibility  of  the  NextGen  system  with  SESAR  and  the  air  traffic  moderniza-
tion  efforts  being  planned  elsewhere  in  the  world  is  very  important  to  U.S.  and
international air carriers. That is because failure to ensure compatibility could lead
to air carriers having to equip their fleets with two sets of communications, naviga-
tion, and surveillance systems.

According  to  FAA,  SESAR  is  conceived  as  a  system  that,  while  smaller  in  scope
and  size,  has  similar  air  traffic  management  goals  as  NextGen.  However,  FAA  has
pointed  out  an  important  difference  in  scope  between  SESAR  and  NextGen.  The
agency  says  that  while  SESAR  focuses  almost  exclusively  on  air  traffic  manage-
ment, NextGen takes what is called a ‘‘curb-to-curb’’ approach, and includes not only
air traffic control, but also airports, airport operations, security and passenger man-
agement,  and  Department  of  Defense  and  Department  of  Homeland  Security  re-
quirements.

The  JPDO  recently  completed  a  comparative  assessment  of  the  NextGen  and

SESAR operational concepts. In this paper, JPDO found that:

• ‘‘The  vision  and  ‘‘philosophical’’  perspectives  of  both  concepts  are  closely
aligned. This is to be expected based on the existence of formal cooperative ar-
rangements between the U.S. and Europe. Further, the participation of a wide
variety  of  stakeholders  in  both  the  JPDO  and  SESAR  initiatives  allowed  for
significant  information  sharing  and  the  identification  of  best  practices  to  be
incorporated.’’
• ‘‘Probably  the  most  easily  recognized  difference  in  the  two  concepts  is  the
breadth of scope. The NextGen ConOps [Concept of Operations] includes a full
‘‘curb-to-curb’’ approach that includes passenger and inter-modal security con-
siderations.  These  build  on  the  traditional  ‘‘block-to-block’’  concepts  that  are
centered  on  the  airspace  operations  (including  environmental  considerations).
The SESAR ATM Target Concept remains focused on the more traditional air-
space elements and recognizes the need to include airport operations for a com-
plete gate-to-gate process description.’’
• ‘‘Another  area  of  difference,  although  not  as  dramatic,  is  how  weather  is  con-
sidered  in  the  two  concepts.  In  the  U.S.  National  Airspace  System,  summer
convective  weather  causes  a  majority  of  system-wide  delays  and  therefore  has
been included as a core element of the proposed concept. Weather is recognized
in the SESAR ATM Target Concept, but there does not appear to be the same
level of focus on infrastructure, prediction, modeling, and planning as appears
to be included in the NextGen concept.’’

The  European  Union  is  also  focusing  its  aeronautics  R&D  on  environmental  ef-
fects. Under the aegis of its Seventh Framework Programme, the EU’s main instru-
ment  for  funding  research  over  the  period  2007  to  2013,  the  Union  will  be  con-
ducting  research  on  developing  technologies  to  reduce  the  environmental  impact  of
aviation with the aim of halving the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by air trans-
port,  cutting  specific  emissions  of  nitrogen  oxides  by  80  percent  and  halving  per-
ceived noise. The research will address green engine technologies, alternative fuels,
novel aircraft/engine configurations, intelligent low-weight structures, improved aer-
odynamic efficiency, airport operations and air traffic management as well as manu-
facturing  and  recycling  processes.  The  ‘‘Clean  Sky’’  Joint  Technology  Initiative  will
bring together European R&D stakeholders to develop ‘green’ air vehicle design, en-
gines  and  systems  aimed  at  minimizing  the  environmental  impact  of  future  air
transport systems. This initiative establishes a Europe-wide partnership between in-
dustry,  universities  and  research  centers,  with  a  total  public/private  funding  of  1.6
billion Euros.

Chairman GORDON. Let me welcome everyone. This is a bit of an
unusual  day  in  that  we  have  the  9/11  Pentagon  Memorial  Service
going on right now, and I understand at 3:00 last night they closed
that  interstate  down  over  there,  so  we  have  I  am  sure  lots  of  staff
and  friends  that  were  Members  that  were  taking  alternate  routes,
will take a little bit longer, and but I know that we have a variety
of  staff  and  Members  also  that  are  watching  this  hearing  on  TV.
And so we want to proceed.

Before  we  get  going  today,  I  want  to  take  care  of  a  few  house-
keeping  details  since  this  will  be  our  last  Full  Committee  hearing
for  the  session.  As  you  may  know,  this  year  marks  the  50th  anni-
versary of the Science and Technology Committee. In honor of that
milestone  we  have  collaborated  with  the  House  Historian’s  Office
to  produce  a  history  of  the  Committee,  and  it  is  on  our  desk  and
will  be  getting  around  to  our  different  stakeholders  and  friends
soon.  The  Historian’s  Office  has  been  working  to  standardize  the
format to best help future researchers and historians, and our his-
tory  will  be  the  model  for  the  Committees  going  forward.  And  so
we have provided these copies today.

Secondly,  since  many  Members  have  expressed  interest  in  at-
tending  a  Shuttle  launch,  I  want  to  let  you  know  that  the  next
launch is currently scheduled for Friday, October the 10th, at 12:30
a.m., so coffee will be provided. There is a possibility that Mr. Mol-
lohan at the Appropriations Committee will be taking a CODEL for
that  launch  and  that  our  Members  have  been  asked  to  join.  And
if not, if we have enough Members, we will put together a CODEL
of our own.

There  is  also  a  launch  that  is  currently  scheduled  for  November

the 12th that might be a better option for some Members.

Third, I would like to, again, congratulate all the Members of the
Committee  for  the  good  and  constructive  work  that  we  have  done
this  year  in  a  very  bipartisan  way.  Today  marks  the  122nd  hear-
ing, and I am sure the, we hear groans going up from the staff be-
cause  of  that,  but  we  have  had  122  hearings.  We  have  moved  78
bills  and  resolutions  through  the  House,  24  of  which  have  become
law, and we have several more pending in the Senate that we hope
that  will  become  law  before  this  session  is  over.  This  is  a  record
that we should all be proud of, and I hope that we can do even bet-
ter next year.

And I am also very pleased that all of those bills and resolutions
came  out  of  this  committee  on  a  bipartisan  basis.  We  are  in  the
process now of trying to close the books on this year. We will soon
start  to  look  at  our  agenda  for  next  year,  and  we  want  to  do  it  in
a  collaborative  way.  We  find  that  if  you  take  good  ideas  and  work
together  with  Democrats  and  Republicans  to  build  a  coalition  that
you get a much better bill, and we are going to continue that.

Also,  for  Members’  attention  I  will  let  you  know  that  we  post-
poned a trip or CODEL to look at some of the nuclear reprocessing
that  is  done  in  France  and  that  we  will  try  to  get  that  back  up
again in the spring.

And so that is—oh, I guess the final point I should make is that
our Committee volunteered to be the model for the new energy-effi-
cient  rooms  here  on  the  Capitol  Complex.  We  have  finished  many
of  those.  As  soon  as  our  last  Subcommittee  hearing  is  over  with

17

they  will  come  in  and  finish  up  this  hearing  room,  and  then  hope-
fully by maybe next January or so we want to invite the family and
friends, particularly of our staff, to come and see where they spend
all their time and to show the rest of Congress how you really can
save energy with an energy-efficient office.

And so, finally, in light of the commemorative ceremony that will
be  taking  place  on  the  Capitol  steps  later  this  morning,  I  intend
to  keep  the  hearing  moving  so  that  we  have  an  adequate  oppor-
tunity  to  hear  from  our  witnesses  and  examine  the  important
issues facing the NextGen Program before Members have to depart
for the ceremony at 11:30.

I, therefore, will be brief in my opening remarks, and I will begin
by welcoming our witnesses to today’s hearing on a very important
topic.  America’s  air  transportation  has  long  been  the  envy  of  the
world,  and  it  is  an  important  contributor  to  the  Nation’s  economic
vitality and quality of life.

Yet  it  is  clear  that  it  is  a  system  under  stress  and  needs  to
change. Congress recognized that fact when it established the Next
Generation  Air  Traffic  Transportation  System  Initiative  now
known as NextGen in its Vision 100 FAA Reauthorization that was
enacted  in  late  2003.  We  sought  to  harness  the  resources  and  ex-
pertise of FAA, NASA, DOD, Commerce, DHS, and OSTP in a joint
effort to transform the Nation’s ATC system so that it will be able
to  handle  the  anticipated  dramatic  future  increase  in  travel  de-
mand without compromising safety or the environment.

Today’s hearing will provide the Committee with the opportunity
to review the progress that has been made to date as well as exam-
ine  the  challenges  that  need  to  be  addressed.  We  should  have  no
illusions  about  the  magnitude  of  the  task.  NextGen  is  a  systems,
engineering,  management,  and  regulatory  challenge  as  complex  as
any the Nation has ever faced. And success is not guaranteed.

Last year we recognized that NextGen has to succeed, recognized
that  NextGen  needs  to  succeed.  This  committee  and  the  Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Committee worked together to frame pro-
visions  in  the  House  FAA  Reauthorization  Bill,  H.R.  2881,  that
sought to strengthen the interagency NextGen planning and devel-
opment  effort  and  to  move  NextGen  R&D  into  new  operational  ca-
pacities as soon as practicable.

In  that  regard,  I  want  to  salute  Chairman  Costello  of  the  T&I
Aviation  Subcommittee  for  his  strong  leadership  in  developing  the
overall  FAA  Reauthorization  Bill  and  for  the  spirit  of  cooperation
he showed to us.

In addition to his T&I responsibility, he is a valued senior Mem-
ber of this committee, and I look forward to continuing to work col-
laboratively with him and his staff on these important issues in the
next Congress.

Yet  we  also  need  for  the  FAA  to  work  cooperatively  with  us  if
we  are  to  fulfill  our  oversight  responsibility  with  respect  to  the
NextGen initiative. Therefore, it was troubling to find out that the
restructuring  of  the  FAA’s  NextGen  Program  this  summer  from
news  accounts  and  not  from  the  FAA  itself.  It  was  also  very  trou-
bling to find out that the status of the NextGen Joint Planning and
Development  Office,  JPDO,  had  been  downgraded  in  the  FAA  and

18

restructuring in a move directly counter to the intent of provisions
of H.R. 2881.

We  need  to  hear  why  FAA  decided  to  take  such  a  step  in  the
waning  days  of  the  current  Administration.  And  finally,  it  is  trou-
bling  that  the  FAA  did  not  deliver  this  testimony  for  today’s  hear-
ing  to  the  Committee  until  yesterday  afternoon  at  3:00,  giving  us
little  time  to  review  it.  I  find  that  unacceptable,  and  I  hope  that
we  will  not  see  a  repeat  of  any  of  these  practices  when  it  comes
to meetings in the 111th Congress.

As  my  friend  Mr.  Hall  remembers,  former  Chairman  Sensen-
brenner  dismissed  a  hearing  like  this  a  few  years  ago  because  of
late  testimony.  We  are  not  going  to  do  that  this  time  because  this
is  our  last  hearing,  but  this  is  going  to  be  important.  This  com-
mittee  is  going  to  do  its  oversight.  We  can  do  it  the  easy  way,  or
we  can  do  it  the  hard  way,  and  hopefully  we  are  going  to  be  able
to work together next year.

Well, we have a great deal of issues to cover today, so I will close
by  simply  expressing  my  strong  belief  that  the  next  President
needs  to  make  the  NextGen  Initiative  a  national  priority  and  en-
sure  that  it  is  given  the  resources,  management  attention,  and
sense of urgency that it warrants. It is important.

Again,  I  want  to  welcome  our  witnesses,  and  I  look  forward  to
their testimony, and I now recognize Mr. Hall for his opening state-
ment.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BART GORDON

America’s  air  transportation  system  has  long  been  the  envy  of  the  world,  and  it

is an important contributor to the Nation’s economic vitality and quality of life.

Yet it is clear that it is a system under stress, and it needs to change.
Congress recognized that fact when it established the Next Generation Air Trans-
portation  System  initiative—now  known  as  NextGen—in  its  Vision  100  FAA  Reau-
thorization that was enacted in late 2003.

We  sought  to  harness  the  resources  and  expertise  of  FAA,  NASA,  DOD,  Com-
merce,  DHS,  and  OSTP  in  a  joint  effort  to  transform  the  Nation’s  ATC  system  so
that it will be able to handle the anticipated dramatic future increases in travel de-
mand without compromising safety or the environment.

Today’s  hearing  will  provide  this  committee  with  the  opportunity  to  review  the
progress  that  has  been  made  to  date  as  well  as  examine  the  challenges  that  need
to be addressed.

We  should  have  no  illusions  about  the  magnitude  of  the  task—NextGen  is  a  sys-
tems engineering, management, and regulatory challenge as complex as any the Na-
tion has ever faced—and success is not guaranteed.

Last  year,  recognizing  that  NextGen  has  to  succeed,  this  committee  and  the
Transportation  and  Infrastructure  Committee  worked  together  to  frame  provisions
in the House’s FAA Reauthorization bill—H.R. 2881—that sought to strengthen the
interagency  NextGen  planning  and  development  effort  and  to  move  NextGen  R&D
into new operational capabilities as soon as practicable.

In  that  regard,  I  want  to  salute  Chairman  Costello  of  T&I’s  Aviation  Sub-
committee  for  his  strong  leadership  in  developing  the  overall  FAA  Reauthorization
bill and for the spirit of cooperation he showed to us.

In addition to his T&I responsibilities, he is a valued senior Member of this com-
mittee,  and  I  look  forward  to  continuing  to  work  collaboratively  with  him  and  his
staff on these important issues in the next Congress.

Yet  we  also  need  for  the  FAA  to  work  cooperatively  with  us  if  we  are  to  fulfill

our oversight responsibilities with respect to the NextGen initiative.

Thus,  it  was  troubling  to  find  out  about  the  restructuring  of  the  FAA’s  NextGen

program this summer from news accounts—and not from the FAA itself.

And  it  was  even  more  troubling  to  find  out  that  the  status  of  the  NextGen  Joint
Planning and Development Office—JPDO—had been downgraded in the FAA in the

restructuring  . . .  a  move  directly  counter  to  the  intent  of  the  provisions  in  H.R.
2881.

We  need  to  hear  why  the  FAA  decided  to  take  such  a  step  in  the  waning  days

of the current Administration.

And  finally,  it  is  troubling  that  the  FAA  did  not  deliver  its  testimony  for  today’s
hearing  to  the  Committee  until  yesterday  afternoon,  giving  us  little  time  to  review
it.

I find that unacceptable, and I hope we will not see a repeat of any of these prac-

tices when we meet again in the 111th Congress.

Well, we have a great many issues to consider today, so I will close by simply ex-
pressing my strong belief that the next President needs to make the NextGen initia-
tive a national priority and ensure that it is given the resources, management atten-
tion, and sense of urgency that it warrants.

It is that important.
Again,  I  want  to  welcome  our  witnesses,  and  I  look  forward  to  your  testimony.
Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  you,  and  before  I  go  into  my
opening  statement  let  me  agree  wholeheartedly  with  your  opening
statement  and  your  outlining  the  accomplishments  of  this  com-
mittee. More than any other committee under the Capitol Dome we
have been successful, and we have been successful because we have
had  good  leadership.  And  I  would  say  this.  If  all  Chairmen  have
operated like our Chairman has operated, both professional leader-
ship  and  personal  friendship  and  cooperation,  we  would  have  less
acrimony  and  less  anxiety  every  two  years  as  to  who  is  going  to
have the gavel. He has rendered a very fair gavel, extended friend-
ship,  and  cooperation,  and  I  think  we  really  ought  to  give  him  a
good round of applause.

So now I will read my statement. And I thank you for calling to-
day’s  hearing  to  review  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration’s  de-
velopment  of  the  Next  Generation  Air  Transportation  System.  I
also want to extend a sincere thank you to our panel of expert wit-
nesses  for  taking  your  time  from  your  busy  schedule  to  appear  be-
fore the Committee.

The information and advice you provide this committee and Con-
gress  will  help  us  better  deal  with  the  challenges  of  modernizing
our  nation’s  critically  important  air  traffic  management  system.
Congress  passed  legislation  not  quite  five  years  ago  calling  for  the
creation of the Joint Planning and Development Office and charged
it with planning for and coordinating the research and development
of a Next Generation Air Transportation System.

The  rationale  for  Congress’  action  was  clear.  Congestion  in  and
around our nation’s airports was reaching gridlock, resulting in sig-
nificant  economic  losses  to  carriers,  severely  inconveniencing  large
numbers  of  passengers,  and  threatening  the  vitality  of  our  econ-
omy. It was estimated that demand for airline services would triple
by  the  year  2025,  and  absent  a  more  comprehensive  and  clearly-
defined research, development, and implementation program future
economic growth would be jeopardized.

Therefore,  Congress  responded  by  creating  the  JPDO  to  address
this serious challenge. Congress clearly recognized that integrating
new, automated features into a nationwide network of communica-
tions, navigation, and surveillance systems is a huge challenge, and
it will take clear and persistent management to achieve NextGen’s
goals.

We also recognize that the future system must allow for more ef-
ficient  routings  and  minimize  delays  in  order  to  conserve  fuel,  the
cost  of  which  has  risen  dramatically  in  the  last  several  months.

Congress was confident then, as we are today, that through the fo-
cused  leadership  of  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration,  the
JPDO,  its  federal  partners,  and  industry,  these  challenges  will  be
met.

This  is  the  second  oversight  hearing  in  as  many  years  held  by
this committee regarding NextGen. I also note that during the first
session  of  this  Congress  our  committee  produced  legislation
strengthening the role and visibility of the Joint Planning and De-
velopment  Office.  Sadly,  the  legislation  has  been  hung  up  in  the
Senate.

The  Nation’s  Air  Traffic  Management  System  is  fundamental  to
our  economy  and  our  quality  of  life.  NextGen  absolutely  must  not
be  allowed  to  falter,  and  it  is  vitally  important  that  there  is  ac-
countability both at the FAA and among federal partners, and that
roles  and  responsibilities  are  clearly  articulated.  So  long  as  there
is  clarity  in  the  management  of  NextGen  and  a  well-understood
and  sustainable  research,  development,  and  implementation  pro-
gram, I am confident that we will succeed.

And Mr. Chairman, I thank you and again, my thanks to the wit-

nesses. I yield back my time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RALPH M. HALL

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  calling  today’s  hearing  to  review  the  Federal  Avia-
tion  Administration’s  development  of  the  Next  Generation  Air  Transportation  Sys-
tem. I also want to extend a sincere thank you to our panel of expert witnesses for
taking time from their busy schedules to appear before our committee. The informa-

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Hall.  If  there  are  Members
who wish to submit additional opening statements, your statement
will be added to the record.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing today. As the Chairman of the
Subcommittee  on  Aviation,  the  NextGen  system  is  one  that  I  have  worked  on  for
some time.

The goal of this program, when implemented, is to significantly increase the safe-
ty,  efficiency,  and  environmental  compatibility  of  air  transportation  operations.
NextGen will move the air transportation system away from the costly ground-based
systems that have defined air traffic control for the past fifty years to satellite based
technology.

The  FAA  forecasts  that  airlines  are  expected  to  carry  more  than  one  billion  pas-
sengers  by  2015,  increasing  from  approximately  740  million  in  2006.  The  Depart-
ment  of  Transportation  (DOT)  predicts  up  to  a  tripling  of  passengers,  operations,
and cargo by 2025. While these predictions may be affected by the high cost of fuel,
nevertheless this modernization is very much needed, and we must ensure its effec-
tive and efficient implementation.

The  NextGen  plan  that  is  under  development  will  consist  of  new  concepts  that
rely  on  satellite-based  capabilities;  data  communications;  information  and  weather
capabilities  that  will  support  strategic  decisions;  and  enhanced  automation.  As
Chairman  of  the  Aviation  Subcommittee  and  after  spending  a  considerable  amount
of time on this project, we have learned that the NextGen system must evolve incre-
mentally  through  sound  contract  management  by  the  FAA  coupled  with  vigorous
Congressional  oversight.  To  that  end,  today’s  hearing  and  the  Science  Committee’s
involvement with NextGen can contribute its success.

I have concerns that FAA’s restructuring related to NextGen lowers the status of
the  Joint  Planning  Development  Office  (JDPO)  and  does  the  complete  opposite  of
what  the  House  directed  in  H.R.  2881,  the  FAA  Reauthorization  bill,  which  we
passed in September 2007. I have also been concerned that under this restructuring,
the roles of the JPDO and the Air Traffic Organization are blurred.

I  believe  we  all  must  work  together  to  ensure  we  have  the  resources  needed  for
NextGen  to  be  a  success  and  so  that  our  aviation  system  continues  to  be  the  best
in the world.

I  want  to  thank  the  Chairman  for  his  attention  to  this  issue.  I  would  also  like
to thank all of our witnesses today for coming and I look forward to the testimony.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Because of my service on the Committee on Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure, I am particularly interested in the subject of today’s Full
Committee hearing.

Our  air  traffic  control  system  is  of  critical  importance  to  our  safety  and  also  to

our national security.

In  June  of  2008,  the  Dallas  Fort  Worth  International  Airport  alone  moved  more

than five million passengers. That is in one month, at one airport.

Our  skies  are  crowded  with  commercial  and  private  aircraft.  As  air  traffic  be-
comes heavier, the technology that manages the load will be under greater pressure
to perform without error.

The Federal Aviation Administration must work with the federal science agencies
to  ensure  that  the  next  generation  of  air  traffic  control  technologies—called
NextGen—will be able to accommodate the needs of tomorrow’s air traffic.

This  wide-ranging  transformation  of  the  national  air  transportation  system  will

move away from long-relied-upon technologies.

It will use more satellite based technology, and it will enable better weather imag-

ing across the entire national airspace system.

The  transformation  will  enable  will  improve  airport  surface  movements  at  busy
airports  such  as  the  one  in  Dallas.  It  will  reduce  spacing  and  separation  require-
ments of aircraft.

The system will also better manage the overall flows into and out of busy metro-

politan airspace to provide maximum use of high demand airports.

NextGen represents the collaborative effort of seven federal organizations, and the
planning  and  implementation  of  it  will  be  carried  out  by  a  unique  public/private
partnership called the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO).

This  committee  will  be  interested  to  know  about  recent  FAA  realignment  of

NextGen activities and changes in the Joint Planning and Development Office.

We  want  to  understand  that  the  reorganization  of  the  project  represents  a  step

toward clarity, rather than a tangle of bureaucracy.

The  American  public  deserves  to  know  how  and  why  these  decisions  are  made.
The reorganization of our national air traffic control system technology is no small
ordeal.  We  as  Members  of  this  committee  are  tasked  to  be  stewards  of  the  public’s
investments.

I  want  to  thank  the  witnesses  who  are  here  today  to  illuminate  matters  for  us.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
[The prepared statement of Chairman Udall follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN MARK UDALL

I  want  to  thank  Chairman  Gordon  for  holding  this  very  timely  hearing.  It  is  im-
portant that this committee continue to pay close attention to the progress and chal-
lenges of the interagency Next Generation Air Transportation System [NextGen] ini-
tiative—the national effort to transform the Nation’s aging air traffic control system
so  that  it  can  accommodate  the  large  increases  in  travel  demand  forecast  to  occur
over the next two decades. As I have often stated, America’s aviation system is vital
to the continued health of our economy and our competitiveness in the wider world
beyond our shores, as well as being important to our quality of life. We need to en-
sure that we do all that is necessary to maintain its health.

Last  year  I  chaired  a  Space  and  Aeronautics  Subcommittee  hearing  on  the  Joint
Planning  and  Development  Office’s  progress  in  planning  and  coordinating  the  re-
search necessary to implement NextGen. I opened last year’s hearing by saying that
I  was  troubled  by  indications  that  all  may  not  be  going  as  well  as  hoped  with  the
NextGen effort and that we had not yet seen a clear plan from FAA and the JPDO
for  implementing  agreed-upon  NextGen  technologies  and  procedures  into  the  Na-
tional  Airspace  System  expeditiously.  As  it  turns  out,  we  found  out  during  that
hearing  that  long-promised  planning  documents  and  a  critical  interagency  Memo-
randum of Understanding were not yet completed. I am keenly interested in seeing
what progress has been made since that hearing.

Today,  the  need  for  NextGen  is  greater  than  ever.  Passengers  are  faced  with  in-
cessant delays, many caused by an aging air traffic control system’s inability to cope
with the capacity-reducing effects of bad weather. Over the short-term, soaring fuel
prices  have  put  some  airlines  on  the  brink  of  economic  collapse.  Over  the  longer-
term,  with  reduced  capital  on  hand  to  pay  for  higher  fuel  costs,  other  airlines  have
postponed purchases of quieter and more fuel efficient aircraft. And just last month,
a shutdown of a critical computer system stranded hundreds of aircraft and delayed
thousands of passengers. As I said after the incident, the outage demonstrated just
how  vulnerable  our  air  traffic  control  system  is—and  how  critical  it  is  to  our  eco-
nomic well-being, competitiveness and our quality of life.

Now  I  want  to  note  that  this  committee  and  this  House  of  Representatives  have
not  been  standing  still.  Last  September  the  House  passed  an  FAA  reauthorization
bill—which  included  provisions  I  authored  to  improve  our  air  traffic  control  sys-
tem—by  a  healthy  margin.  Unfortunately,  that  legislation  has  not  yet  cleared  the
Senate. H.R. 2881 addresses critical needs related to NextGen. The R&D provisions
in the House-passed bill will help ensure that the Nation’s air transportation system
is  able  to  handle  the  expected  significant  growth  in  future  air  travel  demand  over
the next twenty years safely, efficiently, and in an environmentally friendly manner.
It  is  imperative  that  the  Congress  help  ensure  that  FAA  has  the  tools  it  needs
to  keep  the  Nation’s  air  transportation  system  safe,  efficient,  and  environmentally
friendly.  With  a  projected  cost  to  taxpayers  as  much  as  $22  billion  and  to  airspace
users  as  much  as  $20  billion,  it  is  important  that  we  get  NextGen  right  and  that
those  asked  to  make  sizable  investments  get  a  viable  return.  FAA  needs  to  move
smartly and in a focused manner, making sure that announced near-term accelera-
tions of regional demonstrations do not detract from the long-term benefits promised
nationwide.

I  recognize  that  developing  and  implementing  NextGen  are  enormous  challenges.
However, we need to look both at where progress is being made and where improve-
ment  is  needed.  I  look  forward  to  reviewing  the  testimony  of  today’s  distinguished
panel of witnesses and to getting their constructive suggestions on how we can help
make the transition to NextGen a reality.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE LAURA RICHARDSON

I want to thank Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall for holding this im-
portant  hearing  today,  and  our  witnesses  for  their  appearance.  The  purpose  of  to-
day’s  hearing  is  to  examine  the  status  of  the  NextGen  system  and  to  discuss  any
issues surrounding the full implementation of this new technology.

At the end of every legislative week I fly home to my district, and I land at LAX,
one  of  the  Nation’s  busiest  airports.  However,  what  many  travelers  are  not  aware
of, are the numerous runway incursions that have occurred this past decade at LAX,
55  since  2001.  This  number  is  so  alarming  that  the  LA  City  Council  called  on  us,
the  Federal  Government,  to  hire  more  air  traffic  controllers.  Now  assigning  blame
will  not  reduce  the  number  of  incursions,  but  the  implementation  of  the  NextGen
system will, so the status of NextGen is important to me. In fact I was commenting
yesterday in relation to legislation that we passed in the House Tuesday night, that
as  Members  of  Congress  our  most  important  duty  is  to  ensure  the  safety  of  the
American people. We need to maintain the confidence of the American people in our
air traffic system.

Aside  from  the  obvious  safety  issues,  the  stability  of  our  national  economy  de-
pends  upon  a  safe,  reliable  air  traffic  system.  According  to  the  FAA,  independent
economic studies have estimated that if indirect and secondary impacts are included
(such as visitor expenditures and other economic activity generated by aviation) the
industry contributes $640 billion to the U.S. economy—or 5.4 percent of U.S. GDP—
and over nine million jobs.

More  importantly,  the  simple  fact  that  air  travel  is  expected  to  increase  signifi-
cantly in the coming years demands that we implement the NextGen system as soon
as possible. Based on FAA reports in 2005, 738 million passengers flew on U.S. com-
mercial  carriers,  compared  with  579  million  in  1995  and  395  million  in  1985.  Fur-
thermore  the  FAA  expects  this  figure  to  reach  one  billion  passengers  by  2015—less
than  a  decade  from  now.  Last  summer  was  a  grim  reminder  of  the  pain  that  trav-
elers endure when the air traffic system is pushed to its limits.

It  is  my  understanding  that  NextGen,  which  utilizes  GPS  technology,  has  been
used  quite  successfully  for  oceanic  operations.  Therefore  I  would  like  to  hear  from
our  witnesses  what  we  can  learn  from  that  experience.  Likewise  I  also  understand
that  funding  of  the  NextGen  system  is  still  in  question.  I  would  like  to  hear  from
our  witnesses  as  to  how  we  can  achieve  a  balanced  and  adequate  approach  to  fund
this critical piece of technology.

I look forward to a productive discussion, Mr. Chairman I yield back my time.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Carnahan follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSS CARNAHAN

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  hosting  this  hearing  to  examine  the  status  of  the
Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) initiative and the role of the
Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) in charge of planning NextGen.

A  century  ago  the  Wright  brothers  revolutionized  America  by  marking  the  first
successful  human  flight.  From  the  small  beginnings  of  the  Wright  brothers  flying
machine,  to  the  Boeing  747s  that  rule  our  great  skies  today,  the  aviation  industry
has made leaps and bounds in progress. NextGen offers the next stride in the grow-
ing  success  of  aviations  effort  to  become  safer  and  more  efficient.  As  a  Member  of
the  Science  and  Technology  Committee,  and  the  Subcommittee  on  Aviation  at  the
Transportation  &  Infrastructure  Committee,  I  have  a  vested  interest  in  this  issue.
NextGen  offers  many  exciting  possibilities  for  aviation.  The  National  Airspace
System  (NAS)  has  become  operationally  obsolete,  reached  increased  capacity  levels
and  been  affected  by  high  oil  prices.  NextGen  could  offer  the  possibility  of  capacity
relief,  a  curb  in  carbon  dioxide  emissions,  and  a  significant  economic  growth  in  the
industry.  I  am  looking  forward  to  learning  more  about  the  progress  being  made  by
JPDO,  and  hope  the  promise  that  NextGen  offers  to  the  aviation  field  and  the  Na-
tion can become a reality.

I would like to thank today’s witnesses; Ms. Cox, Dr. Dillingham, Mr. Scovel, Dr.
Kaminski,  and  Professor  Waitz  for  taking  the  time  to  appear  before  us.  I  look  for-
ward to hearing your testimonies.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE HARRY E. MITCHELL

24

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Today we will examine the status of the Next Generation Air Transportation Sys-

tem (NextGen) initiative.

As  demand  for  air  travel  continues  to  grow,  and  we  search  for  ways  to  expand
capacity, the deployment of new technology like NextGen is going to play an impor-
tant part.

The  need  for  additional  capacity  is  especially  acute  in  the  Phoenix  metropolitan
area.  Sky  Harbor  Airport  is  already  the  Nation’s  eighth  busiest,  and  the  Federal
Aviation  Administration  has  already  warned  the  Valley  that  it  will  need  additional
capacity to meet the expected increase in demand.

Fortunately,  the  City  Of  Phoenix  is  joining  other  Valley  communities  to  develop
Phoenix–Mesa  Gateway  Airport  on  the  site  of  the  former  Williams  Air  Force  Base
in Mesa.

Just  this  week  we  learned  that  Gateway,  while  still  in  its  infancy  as  a  potential
reliever  for  Phoenix  Sky  Harbor  International  Airport  has  an  estimated  economic
impact  that  has  grown  to  $500  million  a  year  and  supports  more  than  4,500  local
jobs, according to a study by Arizona State University.

I look forward to today’s hearing. At this time I yield back.
Chairman  GORDON.  At  this  time  I  would  like  to  introduce  our
panel of witnesses today. First, we have Ms. Victoria Cox, the Sen-
ior Vice President for NextGen and Operations Planning in the Air
Traffic  Organization  of  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration,  Dr.
Gerald  Dillingham,  who  is  a  Director  of  Physical  Infrastructure
Issues at the Government Accountability Office, the Honorable Cal-
vin  Scovel,  III,  who  is  the  Inspector  General  of  the  U.S.  Depart-
ment  of  Transportation,  Dr.  Paul  Kaminski,  who  is  the  Chairman
and CEO of——

Dr. KAMINSKI. Technovation.
Chairman GORDON. Technovation, and Dr. Ian Waitz, who is the
Director  of  the  FAA-  and  NASA-sponsored  Center  of  Excellence
PARTNER and the Head of the Department of Aeronautics and As-
tronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Welcome  all.  And  as  our  witnesses  should  know,  spoken  testi-
mony  is  limited  to  five  minutes  each,  after  which  the  Members  of
the  Committee  will  have  five  minutes  each  to  ask  questions,  and
we will start with you, Ms. Cox.

STATEMENT  OF  MS.  VICTORIA  COX,  SENIOR  VICE  PRESIDENT
FOR  NEXTGEN  AND  OPERATIONS  PLANNING,  AIR  TRAFFIC
ORGANIZATION, FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION
Ms.  COX.  Good  morning,  Chairman  Gordon.  Thank  you.  It  is  a
pleasure  to  address  you  and  Congressman  Hall  and  Members  of
this committee. I am Victoria Cox, the FAA’s Senior Vice President
for NextGen and Operations Planning.

Congress  has  been  direct  in  its  charge  to  the  FAA;  improve  the
level  of  safety,  security,  efficiency,  quality,  and  affordability  of  the
Air  Transportation  System  and  reduce  the  production  of  noise  and
emissions.

We  are  following  that  guidance  as  we  develop  and  deploy  the
Next  Generation  Air  Transportation  System.  NextGen  will  apply
the  same  precision,  automation,  and  access  to  information  to  avia-
tion  that  already  exists  in  other  industries  and  in  our  daily  lives.
We  can  deliver  it,  and  we  intend  to  deliver  first  in  the  places  that
need  it  most.  We  are  accelerating  our  efforts  with  focused  deploy-
ment  of  NextGen  precision  aviation  capabilities  around  our  most

congested  airports.  We  are  fostering  partnerships  with  operators
equipped to perform precision navigation procedures.

These  efforts  are  yielding  big  benefits  and  lessons  learned,  but
the  real  punch  comes  in  the  form  of  immediate  reductions  to
delays,  fuel  use,  and  emissions.  We  are  still  not  where  we  want  to
be, but we are making progress.

One of the early successes is the Atlantic Inter-operability Initia-
tive  to  Reduce  Emissions  or  AIRE.  It  is  a  research  and  technology
development  venture  among  the  FAA,  the  European  Commission,
and industry partners. It upgrades air traffic control standards and
procedures in trans-Atlantic flights.

When  you  make  even  small  changes  in  fuel  use  on  flights  that
are  typically  several  hours  long  and  cover  thousands  of  miles,  the
results  are  dramatic.  We  have  already  seen  a  fuel  savings  of  one
percent  in  oceanic  airspace.  A  typical  oceanic  flight  might  burn
13,000  gallons.  Multiply  that  by  the  number  of  flights  over  the
course  of  a  year,  and  one  percent  is  a  lot  of  fuel  saved  and  a  lot
of emissions reduced.

We  are  planning  similar  demonstrations  in  the  South  Pacific.  In
fact,  the  first  of  three  demonstration  flights  will  occur  tomorrow
from New Zealand to San Francisco.

We  are  using  NextGen  technology  to  make  things  more  efficient
on  the  ground  as  well.  We  are  introducing  state-of-the-art  surface
management tools at JFK. These are based on Airport Surface De-
tection  Equipment  Model  X  or  ASDE–X.  Last  summer  at  JFK  a
plane  that  had  been  holding  on  a  ramp  for  hours  might  not  have
had an option to turn back to the gate readily because no one, not
the  airline  and  not  air  traffic  control,  had  a  common  picture  of
where  all  other  aircraft  were  located  on  the  ramps  and  at  the
gates. As of last month much-needed information about aircraft lo-
cation  is  available  to  airlines,  controllers,  and  to  FAA’s  command
center in Herndon, Virginia.

Service  operations  are  no  longer  a  black  hole  at  JFK.  Delta  Air-
lines  is  already  using  this  capability.  This  JFK  initiative  stems
from a joint FAA, NASA research and development project in Mem-
phis  with  Fed  Ex  and  Northwest  Airlines.  With  this  capability
Northwest has significantly improved their operations, lowered fuel
consumption, and cut emissions.

Progress is being made, but we know that NextGen implementa-
tion is a difficult and complex undertaking. And while it cannot be
accomplished  without  cooperation  across  the  entire  FAA  and  the
NextGen  partner  agencies,  we  understand  that  there  must  be  a
single point of accountability. To that end the FAA established the
position of Senior Vice President for NextGen and Operations Plan-
ning. In that position I am directly responsible and accountable for
all  elements  of  NextGen  and  have  decision  authority  over  all  mat-
ters  related  to  NextGen  integration  and  implementation  in  the
FAA.

The  establishment  of  this  office  places  the  Joint  Planning  and
Development  Office,  the  Legacy  Operations  planning  function,  and
the  new  office  of  NextGen  Integration  and  Implementation  under
a  common  reporting  structure.  This  restructuring  is  an  indication
of  the  changing  focus  of  NextGen  from  purely  planning  and  re-
search  to  actual  integration  and  implementation  capabilities  that

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:09 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 044270 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL08\091108\44270 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

26

will  transform  the  National  Airspace  System.  And  it  is  also  a  rec-
ognition  of  the  fact  that  implementation  must  occur  in  the  oper-
ational environment.

We  are  not  losing  sight  of  the  future  NextGen  vision.  Our  Joint
Planning  and  Development  Office  will  continue  to  focus  on  long-
term R&D and on cross agency cooperation. The FAA is placing its
emphasis  on  near-term  implementation  and  mid-term  planning
over a rolling 10-year timeframe.

Given  the  impact  on  aviation,  of  aviation  on  the  U.S.  economy
and  the  long-standing  support  from  this  committee,  this  Congress,
and  most  of  the  aviation  community,  I  sincerely  believe  that  the
impetus  for  NextGen  and  its  program  focus  will  continue  and  not
suffer as transitions occur.

In  closing,  I  want  to  thank  both  this  Administration  and  this
Congress  for  supporting  the  FAA’s  NextGen  budget  request.  Mr.
Chairman,  this  concludes  my  testimony,  and  I  would  be  happy  to
answer any questions the Committee may have.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Cox follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF VICTORIA COX

Good  morning,  Chairman  Gordon,  Congressman  Hall,  and  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee. I am Victoria Cox, Senior Vice-President for NextGen and Operations Plan-
ning in the Air Traffic Organization at the Federal Aviation Administration. I thank
you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today  about  the  status  of  the  work  we  are  doing
to  develop  and  deploy  the  Next  Generation  Air  Transportation  System  (NextGen)
and  to  discuss  how  we  are  providing  operational,  environmental,  and  safety  en-
hancements that deliver benefits to our customers today and into the future.

As  you  know,  NextGen  is  not  a  single  capability  or  program  to  be  delivered  at
some  date  in  the  future;  it  is  a  portfolio  of  capabilities  and  programs  that  we  are
beginning  to  deliver  now—and  will  continue  to  provide  in  an  evolutionary  manner.
It is also important to remember that NextGen is not simply about air traffic capa-
bilities,  but  fostering  improvements  in  ground  infrastructure,  aircraft  technology,
and alternative fuels.

Much progress has been made during the past year. We have moved to accelerate
initiatives  that  yield  benefits  to  stakeholders  in  the  near-  and  mid-term.  We  have
also  taken  steps  to  ensure  a  more  holistic  approach  to  managing  NextGen  and  re-
lated  legacy  programs.  Last  spring,  the  Secretary  of  Transportation  and  the
NextGen  Senior  Policy  Committee,  which  was  established  by  Public  Law  108–176
(Vision  100)  and  is  chaired  by  Secretary  Peters,  asked  us  to  take  immediate  action
to accelerate the deployment of NextGen. In response to this call, the FAA and the
other NextGen agencies have focused on accelerating deployment of operational im-
provements to address the greatest need and on developing the capabilities that will
provide  the  greatest  benefit.  FAA  has  leveraged  its  research  and  development  in-
vestments  to  accelerate  targeted  implementations  and  development  of  critical  capa-
bilities.

The introduction and wide-spread use of precision navigation tools that deliver in-
creased  precision  to  our  operations  represent  the  first  step  in  our  transition  to
NextGen.  We  are  focusing  deployment  of  Area  Navigation  (RNAV)  and  Required
Navigation  Performance  (RNP)  around  our  most  congested  airports,  using  these
tools  to  increase  capacity  and  operational  efficiency.  Partnerships  with  operators
equipped  to  perform  these  procedures  are  yielding  the  biggest  benefits  from  in-
creases  in  operational  efficiency  and  reductions  in  fuel  use  and  emissions.  Today,
87  percent  of  commercial  operators  are  equipped  to  fly  RNAV  routes  and  proce-
dures; and 39 percent are equipped to fly the RNP Special Aircraft and Aircrew Au-
thorization  Required  (SAAAR)  approaches  that  allow  design  of  flight  paths  to
achieve  more  optimal  use  of  airspace.  FAA  has  approved  these  types  of  approaches
at  Atlanta,  Dallas/Fort  Worth,  Newark,  Washington  Dulles,  LaGuardia,  Chicago
Midway,  Miami,  and  San  Francisco.  To  date  this  year,  we  have  published  20  RNP
SAAAR  approach  procedures  at  eight  airports,  including  San  Jose,  Washington
Reagan  National,  Indianapolis  and  Los  Angeles.  We  have  also  published  63  RNAV
Standard  Instrument  Departure  (SID)  and  Standard  Terminal  Arrival  (STAR)  pro-
cedures  at  45  airports,  including  Atlanta,  Charlotte,  Cincinnati,  Newark,  Orlando,
Phoenix, Portland (OR), Santa Monica and Tucson.

27

We  are  also  seeing  benefits  today  from  the  introduction  of  Optimized  Profile  De-
scents or OPD. The OPD lets pilots use the Continuous Descent Arrival (CDA) tech-
nique  to  fly  a  continuous  descent  path,  rather  than  the  traditional  ‘‘step  downs’’
typically  flown  today.  Airplanes  initiate  descent  from  a  high  altitude  with  engines
at  low  power  and,  ideally,  maintain  a  continuous  descent  until  cleared  to  land.
Flight  demonstrations  at  Louisville’s  Standiford  Airport  and  testing  at  Atlanta
Hartsfield have shown fuel savings averaging about 50–60 gallons of fuel for the ar-
rival portion of flights and a reduction of as much as 1,200 pounds of carbon dioxide
per  arrival.  Significant  noise  reduction  is  also  achieved  through  the  later  deploy-
ment  of  flaps  and  landing  gear  allowed  by  the  CDA’s  gradual  reduction  in  speed.
Under its NextGen Demonstration program, FAA is continuing with targeted imple-
mentations of Optimized Profile Descent procedures at San Diego in addition to At-
lanta  and  is  cooperating  with  the  United  States  Air  Force  Air  Mobility  Command
to  introduce  OPD  procedures  with  its  C17  fleet  in  Charleston,  SC.  OPD  procedures
have been instituted in Los Angeles on a permanent basis and are delivering major
benefits in terms of operational efficiency and the environment.

Another  NextGen-related  demonstration  program  is  the  Atlantic  Inter-operability
Initiative to Reduce Emissions (AIRE), a research and technology development ven-
ture  between  FAA,  the  European  Commission  and  industry  partners.  AIRE  focuses
on up-grading air traffic control standards and procedures for trans-Atlantic flights.
A  similar  initiative  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region,  the  Asia  and  South  Pacific  Initiative
to  Reduce  Emissions  (ASPIRE)  has  also  been  initiated.  In  fact,  tomorrow  Air  New
Zealand is operating a flight, nicknamed ASPIRE I, from Auckland to San Francisco
that  will  demonstrate  some  of  the  potential  efficiencies.  Our  Vice  President  for
Enroute  and  Oceanic  Services  will  be  on-board.  Both  of  these  initiatives  will  en-
hance  fuel  efficiency  while  reducing  environmental  impacts.  Our  first  AIRE  dem-
onstrations  showed  one  percent  fuel  savings  in  oceanic  airspace—a  significant
amount of fuel and carbon emissions for these very long flights.

Other  near-term  benefits  stemming  from  targeted  implementations  of  the
NextGen  acceleration  initiative  include  the  introduction  of  surface  management
tools  at  JFK  with  the  accelerated  introduction  of  the  Airport  Surface  Detection
Equipment—Model  X  (ASDE–X).  FAA,  in  partnership  with  the  Port  Authority  of
New York and New Jersey and airlines, is providing information about surface traf-
fic  in  both  movement  and  ramp  areas  on  the  airport  to  Airline  Operation  Centers,
air  traffic  controllers  and  the  FAA  Command  Center.  This  information  gives  com-
mon  situational  awareness  that  will  allow  airlines  to  better  manage  movement  of
their  aircraft  in  crowded  ramp  areas.  The  inability  for  airlines  to  know  the  exact
location of their aircraft on the surface relative to other traffic contributes to surface
gridlock  and  difficulty  moving  aircraft  back  to  gates  when  required.  As  of  last
month, this much-needed information is available.

This  capability  stems  from  a  joint  FAA/NASA  research  and  development  project
at Memphis with FedEx and Northwest Airlines. The Memphis project is developing
a surface traffic management system that employs a two-way, collaborative environ-
ment between the FAA and airlines to significantly improve the efficiency of ground
operations  and  will  be  integrated  with  arrival  and  departure  traffic  to  enable  the
most efficient use of airport and terminal facilities and reduce emissions that impact
air quality.

These  and  other  demonstrations  are  providing  valuable  information  that  will  as-
sist FAA in developing standards and procedures for operations in the NextGen en-
vironment  while  providing  immediate  benefits  to  targeted  areas.  FAA  plans  to  con-
tinue these activities in an integrated test bed approach that focuses on Florida, the
east  coast,  Texas,  and  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  and  takes  advantage  of  early  Automatic
Dependent  Surveillance-Broadcast  (ADS–B)  deployment.  Upcoming  demonstrations
include tailored arrivals in Miami starting later this month with American Airlines
and with Air France. We will also begin integrating predictive weather information
as  part  of  the  Traffic  Management  Advisor  (TMA)  at  Daytona  Beach  with  Embry
Riddle and a consortium of companies in November. We have over 20 partners from
the  airlines,  industry,  academia,  and  other  government  agencies  that  are  involved
in demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of integrated NextGen capabilities. We
will  model  these  and  another  demonstration  in  ways  that  enable  more  rapid,  wide-
spread deployment of these capabilities in the future.

NextGen  will  bring  major  changes  to  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  all  the  par-
ticipants in the NAS, especially the controller, as the NAS becomes more automated
and some tasks are delegated to the pilots flying more sophisticated aircraft. A stra-
tegic  job  analysis  has  been  initiated  to  examine  how  changes  to  technology,  roles,
responsibilities  and  procedures  will  impact  the  aptitudes,  knowledge,  skills  and
abilities  that  we  will  expect  from  controllers  as  NextGen  matures.  This  will  enable

28

the NAS to go from a ‘‘controlled’’ airspace environment to a ‘‘managed’’ airspace en-
vironment, allowing automation to assist with decision-making.

The  human  factors  research  program  has  also  delivered  products  that  enable  the
use  of  data  communications  in  the  en  route  domain  and  is  now  focused  on  the  in-
creased  use  of  RNAV,  limited  self  spacing,  and  novel  modes  of  grouping  aircraft  to
enable  an  increase  in  capacity  while  reducing  controller  workload  and  error  poten-
tial.

Another  key  NextGen  transformation  is  the  move  from  Forensic  Safety  Systems
to Prognostic Safety Systems, as evidenced by the development of the Aviation Safe-
ty and Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) system. The ASIAS program inte-
grates  a  large  number  of  previously  unrelated  data  sources  from  both  government
and  industry  into  a  comprehensive  safety  picture  that  can  assist  in  identifying
emerging  risks  and  enabling  earlier  interventions  against  these  risks  before  they
can lead to accidents.

Research  and  development  in  the  weather  arena  is  providing  advanced  weather
capabilities to improve NAS operations during adverse conditions. This requires im-
provements  in  weather  forecasting  and  observation  network  capabilities  as  well  as
integration  of  weather  into  decision  support  tools.  Improvements  in  forecasts  and
observations quality developed by the Aviation Weather Research Program (AWRP)
are  aimed  at  providing  more  accurate  aviation  weather  forecasts  for  phenomena
such  as  turbulence,  convective  activity,  icing,  and  restrictions  to  visibility.  The
Weather Technology in the Cockpit (WTIC) program will facilitate the development
of  technologies  necessary  to  integrate  weather  information  into  aircraft-based  deci-
sion support systems. WTIC will enable pilots to access weather information similar
to that being utilized by air traffic controllers and dispatchers on the ground.

In  Fiscal  Year  2008,  the  wake  turbulence  research  program  completed  prototype
evaluations  of  the  Wake  Turbulence  Mitigation  for  Departures  tool,  a  product  of
NASA and FAA research and development, that permits increased departure capac-
ity from airports with closely spaced parallel runways. Prototype evaluations of the
system were conducted at Houston Intercontinental and Lambert St. Louis airports.
Another  application  of  research  and  development  has  been  wake  turbulence  data
collection and analysis in support of a National Rule Change which would allow the
use  of  ILS  procedures  to  Closely  Spaced  Runways  for  specific  aircraft  types,  thus
increasing capacity at five specific airports.

The  wake  program,  along  with  global  partners,  has  evaluated  separation  stand-
ards for new aircraft (B–747–8, A380) and has re-evaluated the B757 family of air-
craft. We have also developed a methodology and optimization tools for the re-eval-
uation  of  wake  turbulence  categories  and  separation  standards  for  today’s  aircraft
fleet  mix,  which  has  changed  significantly  since  the  early  1990’s.  Working  jointly
with  European  Air  Navigation  Service  Providers  and  aircraft  manufacturers,  FAA
is seeking a harmonized set of wake categories and wake separation minima for the
NAS and International fleet mixes.

In  an  example  of  concept  validation  that  shows  great  promise,  FAA  researchers
are developing the concept for an Integrated Arrival/Departure Control Service that
we  are  calling  ‘‘Big  Airspace.’’  Employing  modeling  and  simulation,  including
human-in-the-loop  simulations,  researchers  used  scenarios  that  incorporated  a  ge-
neric  large  metropolitan  area,  a  major  airport  and  three  small  airports  into  the
same Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facility. The ‘‘Big Airspace’’ con-
cept  extends  terminal  procedures  to  a  portion  of  en  route  transition  airspace,  in-
creasing  the  number  of  RNAV  routes,  and  incorporating  dynamic  resectorization  (a
fundamental  NextGen  concept)  to  allow  airspace  boundaries  to  be  more  flexible.  A
key  element  of  ‘‘Big  Airspace’’  is  the  incorporation  of  all  operations  into  one  facility
to  reduce  the  amount  of  cross-facility  coordination  needed  to  safely  manage  traffic
into and out of busy areas. Human-in-the-Loop simulations employed both terminal
and  en  route  controllers  as  well  as  pilots  who  flew  simulated  aircraft  linked  to  the
simulation.  Results  of  the  modeling  and  these  simulations  showed  that  controllers
could  handle  up  to  50  percent  more  traffic.  With  the  introduction  of  data  commu-
nications, controllers may handle up to 150 percent more traffic before performance
degraded,  all  without  a  significant  change  in  the  number  of  operational  errors  and
with a significant decrease in the number of conflicts.

With  2012  projected  traffic,  ‘‘Big  Airspace’’  simulations  showed  increased  oper-
ational  efficiencies  of  about  a  minute  of  flight  time  and  five  nautical  miles  in  sce-
narios  with  weather  present.  To  provide  context  for  these  savings,  Southwest  Air-
lines  has  indicated  that  for  its  operations  a  single  minute  of  time  saved  on  each
flight  contributes  an  annual  savings  of  up  to  $25  million  in  fuel  per  year.  Extend
this  to  the  number  of  flights  operated  by  all  carriers  in  major  metropolitan  areas
and  you  can  see  that  ‘‘Big  Airspace’’  adds  up  to  tremendous  savings  for  all  our  air-

lines. FAA is building towards implementing ‘‘Big Airspace’’ as its mid-term concept
in high density metropolitan areas.

Accelerating  air  traffic  management  improvements  is  leading  to  efficiencies  and
reducing  fuel  burn,  but  we  are  also  pursuing  other  R&D  strategies  to  mitigate
NextGen  environmental  impacts.  We  are  hastening  the  development  of  promising
environmental improvements in aircraft technology. The President’s budget funds a
research  consortium  called  Continuous  Low  Emissions,  Energy  and  Noise  (CLEEN)
which will allow us to work with industry to accelerate the maturation of technology
that  will  lower  energy,  emissions  and  noise.  CLEEN  offers  a  good  example  of  FAA
and NASA partnership in advancing the NextGen plan as we worked together close-
ly  in  developing  this  initiative  to  mature  technology  with  NASA’s  foundational  re-
search efforts.

We are also exploring the potential of alternative fuels for aviation. Fuels that im-
prove emissions performance at both the local and global level not only help the en-
vironment, but also enhance energy security and supplies. Issues of fuel supply and
costs  are  having  an  increasing  impact  on  the  shape  of  the  U.S.  aviation  system—
as  fuel  costs  now  approach  up  to  40  percent  of  airline  operating  costs.  To  this  end,
the FAA helped form—and is an active participant in—the Commercial Aviation Al-
ternative  Fuels  Initiative,  or  CAAFI.  We  have  already  seen  coal-to-liquid  and  gas-
to-liquid  fuels  in  jets,  and  most  recently  completed  a  bio-fuel  flight  demonstration.
Alternative fuels will be the ‘‘game changer’’ technology that gets us closer to carbon
neutrality. Alternative fuels are a part of the CLEEN effort.

Activities  like  these  that  consist  of  concept  validation  employing  modeling  and
simulation, prototyping and field demonstrations in an operational environment can
accelerate the transition from concepts and research and development to implemen-
tation of operational systems. FAA is employing this approach in an effort to accel-
erate  NextGen  implementation.  Not  only  will  this  approach  speed  the  development
of NextGen operational improvements, it is also aimed at speeding their acquisition
by accomplishing, in parallel, required steps in FAA’s Acquisition Management Sys-
tem.

Another way that FAA is accelerating transition from research to implementation
is  through  Research  Transition  Teams  (RTT)  between  NASA  and  FAA,  facilitated
by the JPDO. The goal of the RTTs is to ensure that R&D needed for NextGen im-
plementation  is  identified,  conducted,  and  effectively  transitioned  to  the  imple-
menting  agency.  Four  teams  are  successfully  underway  with  NASA  and  FAA  en-
gagement.

The  approaches  described  above  are  mechanisms  we  have  established  to  ensure
that  we  retain  the  focus  on  the  goals  of  NextGen  while  moving  expeditiously  to  in-
corporate changes into the National Airspace System which support those goals and
begin to achieve the benefits of a transformed system in a timely manner.

This  year  has  seen  a  shift  in  focus  for  NextGen  from  planning  to  action.  The  re-
alignment  of  responsibilities  for  NextGen  under  a  Senior  Vice  President  for
NextGen  and  Operations  Planning  is  an  indication  of  that  changing  focus  of
NextGen  from  purely  planning  and  research  to  actual  implementation  and  integra-
tion  of  technologies  that  will  transform  the  National  Airspace  System.  As  we  enter
this  new  phase,  the  Agency  decided  to  place  accountability  for  all  aspects  of
NextGen,  including  management  of  the  NextGen  investment  portfolio,  under  one
senior official.

This  realignment  also  responds  to  stakeholder  requests  for  a  single  point  of  ac-
countability for NextGen and addresses the suggestion raised by Industry, including
members  of  JPDO  Working  Groups,  that  more  focused  oversight  by  FAA  of  JPDO
deliverables would be desirable.

With  the  establishment  of  the  NextGen  and  Operations  Planning  organization
under  the  leadership  of  a  Senior  Vice  President,  the  Joint  Planning  and  Develop-
ment  Office  (JPDO),  the  Operations  Planning  function,  and  the  new  Office  of
NextGen  Integration  and  Implementation  have  a  common  reporting  structure.  For
the FAA this ensures that the Agency acts promptly to achieve the JPDO vision by
accomplishing the right kind of R&D and that a steady stream of improvements tak-
ing us along the road to NextGen are delivered for implementation and coordination
with legacy systems operations. This arrangement increases FAA support for JPDO
Working  Groups  as  well  as  cross-agency  initiatives  by  closer  linking  of  FAA  to
JPDO.

The Senior Vice President for NextGen and Operations Planning is responsible for
implementation  of  all  elements  of  NextGen,  most  of  which  are  executed  by  other
service units in the Air Traffic Organization and other lines of business in the FAA,
and has decision authority over all matters related to NextGen integration and im-
plementation  including  allocation  within  the  Agency  of  the  $688  million  NextGen
budget request for fiscal year 2009.

NextGen  implementation  is  a  difficult  and  complex  undertaking  that  cannot  be
accomplished  without  cooperation  across  the  industry,  the  FAA  and  the  NextGen
partner  agencies.  The  Senior  Vice  President  for  NextGen  and  Operations  Planning
has  a  direct  and  immediate  path  to  the  FAA  Administrator  and  the  Secretary  of
Transportation should their assistance be required.

The  highly  successful  FAA-wide  Operational  Evolution  Plan  (OEP)  process  is  the
basis  for  guiding  NextGen  integration  and  implementation  and  ensuring  the  co-
operation  of  all  elements  within  the  FAA  with  NextGen  responsibilities.  This  proc-
ess  includes  all  FAA  organizations,  within  and  outside  of  the  ATO  including  the
JPDO. The process tracks specific capability improvements through R&D, field dem-
onstration,  investment  decision,  acquisition  and  implementation,  with  clear  objec-
tives  that  result  in  specific  commitments  to  the  operating  community  outside  FAA.
An  executive  oversight  board  (NextGen  Management  Board)  at  the  Associate  Ad-
ministrator  level,  chaired  by  the  Deputy  Administrator,  oversees  the  process.  A  re-
view  board  (NextGen  Review  Board)  manages  the  flow  of  improvements  from  con-
cept, through R&D, to investment decision, to implementation. Aviation community
participation  will  be  improved  through  a  formal  advisory  process,  Industry  Days,
and  stepping  up  stakeholder  participation  at  the  SPC,  which  encourage  feedback
from users, operators, and developers.

An important product of the process described above is the NextGen Implementa-
tion Plan, the latest version of which was published on June 30, 2008. The plan de-
tails  implementation  commitments  for  the  near-term  (between  2009–2011),  and  de-
scribes  more  than  30  additional  improvements  targeted  for  introduction  between
2012  and  2018.  This  version  shows  how  FY09  research  and  development  projects
move  us  toward  specific  outcomes.  The  entire  plan  can  be  accessed  on  line  at
www.faa.gov/nextgen.

As directed by the Secretary of Transportation, who is Chair of the NextGen SPC,
JPDO  will  continue  to  focus  on  long-term  (beyond  10  years)  research  and  develop-
ment and cross-agency coordination with FAA placing emphasis on near-term imple-
mentation and mid-term planning over a rolling 10 year timeframe. FAA will ensure
that  the  Agency’s  implementation  plans  and  Integrated  Work  Plan  are  aligned  for
the  near  and  mid-term,  while  keeping  an  eye  to  the  future  that  JPDO  is  defining
through the long-term R&D plan. The JPDO Integrated Work Plan (IWP), will also
be  published  this  month,  is  still  a  work  in  progress,  and  the  elements  in  it  have
not yet been prioritized. That said, it represents a great amount of work across the
NextGen  agencies  and  industry  to  document  their  initial  development  work  and
planning.

An overarching goal, and a clear responsibility of JPDO, is a long-term R&D pro-
gram, with well-defined and prioritized research goals and supporting activities and
that responsibility will be clearly assigned to the Partner agencies. Success will de-
pend  on  assuring  that  agency  R&D  budgets  are  linked.  Research  must  be  aligned
to leverage cross-agency investments and deliver products that will transition to im-
plementation.

We  are  confident  that  planned  investments  lead  to  the  capabilities  described  out
to  2018.  These  are  investments  in  the  five  transformational  programs  discussed
later,  as  well  as  to  seven  solution  sets.  In  total,  they  fund  research,  engineering,
analysis, demonstrations, concept validation and ATC infrastructure enhancements.
The  far-term,  beyond  2018,  is  dependent  on  research  that  is  ongoing  or  planned  in
coordination  with  the  JPDO.  The  results  of  that  research  will  be  used  to  guide  the
far-term  development.  JPDO  will  continue  to  maintain  the  vision  of  NextGen  and
will  update  the  Concept  of  Operations  in  accordance  with  results  of  the  long-term
research that it is charting.

JPDO will also continue to produce a yearly Progress Report. This year’s progress
has been noteworthy. The Senior Policy Committee (SPC), chaired by the Secretary
of  Transportation,  provides  directed  focus  on  important  efforts  including  a  govern-
ment-wide  Safety  Management  System;  a  collaborative  weather  initiative  involving
the  Department  of  Commerce  (DOC),  FAA  and  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD);
an  initiative  for  net-centric  aviation  information  sharing;  and  planning  for  inte-
grated  aviation  surveillance  with  the  DOD,  Department  of  Homeland  Security
(DHS) and FAA.

JPDO  has  formalized  organizational  relationships  with  partners  to  facilitate
transfer  of  technology  for  NextGen  application  by  establishing  the  previously  de-
scribed  Research  Transition  Teams  to  facilitate  smooth  transition  of  research  prod-
ucts  from  NASA  to  FAA.  Additionally,  the  DOD  has  established  a  NextGen  Joint
Planning  Office  with  the  U.S.  Air  Force  leading  to  coordinated  DOD  contributions
and  technology  transfer.  The  DOD,  DHS  and  FAA  also  jointly  invested  in  a  dem-
onstration of Network Enabled Operations technology.

JPDO completed a gap analysis of NextGen partner agency programs against the
Integrated  Work  Plan.  The  gap  analysis  identified  seven  critical  interagency  focus
areas,  including  various  ATM  research  topics,  research  to  mitigate  environmental
constraints,  security  risk  management,  and  the  verification  and  validation  of  com-
plex systems. FAA was identified as the lead for three of the focus areas, NASA for
two, DHS for one, and JPDO for one. Working with the partner agencies, the JPDO
will  incorporate  operational  improvements  that  address  these  gaps  into  the  Inte-
grated  Work  Plan  and  through  the  governance  process,  including  the  JPDO  Board
and  SPC,  will  encourage  partner  agencies  to  include  activities  that  support  these
operational  improvements  in  their  implementation  plans  and  future  year  budgets.
As we move forward with NextGen it is important for us to measure our progress
by defining our near-term, mid-term, and long-term goals with suitable performance
metrics. The right metrics will allow us to determine not only how well we are doing
but  also  the  impacts  of  events  that  reduce  or  delay  progress.  FAA  plans  to  employ
three methods of measurement. First, we will track progress against milestones es-
tablished in the NextGen Implementation Plan. These are linked directly to the Na-
tional  Airspace  System  Enterprise  Architecture  decision  points.  We  will  also  track
investments,  measuring  whether  specified  products  are  delivered  on  time  and  on
budget.  We  are  also  developing  methods  to  measure  and  report  on  benefits  accrued
with  the  implementation  of  NextGen  capabilities  in  an  integrated  fashion  rather
than the case by case approach that we take today.

The  FAA’s  National  Aviation  Research  Plan  (NARP)  published  in  February  2008
identifies  $740  Million  for  NextGen  R&D  in  the  President’s  Fiscal  Year  2009–2013
budget  with  $83.5  Million  requested  in  Fiscal  Year  2009.  Much  of  the  other  R&D
work contained in the 2009 request is NextGen enabling.

My testimony has focused on R&D, Advanced Technology Development and Proto-
typing  and  Demonstration  investments.  Major  NextGen  transformational  programs
are  making  progress  as  well.  ADS–B  has  continued  to  meet  all  the  program  mile-
stones.  Since  the  national  contract  was  awarded  last  summer,  the  program  has  de-
ployed the ground infrastructure in the Southern Florida key site area. The system
has  for  the  first  time  equipped  pilots  to  receive  traffic  and  weather  in  the  cockpit
for  enhanced  situational  awareness.  The  system  will  reach  an  In  Service  Decision
(ISD)  for  essential  services  for  commissioning  into  the  National  Airspace  System
(NAS) in November 2008. Critical services IOC and ISD is planned for 2010.

While  the  agency  has  been  busy  with  deploying  the  ground  equipment,  we  are
also simultaneously working on the rule-making for ADS–B. The Notice of Proposed
Rule-making  (NPRM)  was  published  in  October  2007.  The  comment  period  closed
in March 2008 and the agency is taking into account every single comment that was
received.  We  have  been  working  closely  with  all  facets  of  the  aviation  community
through  the  ADS–B  Aviation  Rule-making  Committee  (ARC).  We  will  consider  all
the  recommendations  from  the  aviation  community  in  developing  the  final  rule,
which we estimate will be published in spring 2010.

The System-Wide Information (SWIM) Program recently awarded a $37M contract
for commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) software to Iona Technologies of Waltham, Mas-
sachusetts.  This  software  will  help  FAA  develop  interfaces  between  systems  more
quickly  and  cheaply,  and  will  help  establish  new  connections  between  systems  and
with new users—just what’s needed for NextGen.

The Data Communications program and the NAS Voice Switch program have both
completed  development  of  initial  program  requirements,  and  the  NextGen  Network
Enabled  Weather  (NNEW)  program  has  begun  analysis  to  develop  standards  for
universal  access  to  a  weather  data  base,  which  will  contain  forecast  information  of
interest to all national airspace participants including FAA, Department of Defense,
National Weather Service and our European partners.

I  thank  both  this  Administration  and  this  Congress  for  supporting  the  FAA’s
NextGen  budget  requests  and  hope  that  issues  surrounding  the  FAA’s  reauthoriza-
tion  are  quickly  resolved.  Be  assured  that  we  will  identify  NextGen  as  a  key  pro-
grammatic  and  budgetary  issue  requiring  decisions  from  policy-makers  in  the  in-
coming Administration.

Given  the  impact  of  aviation  on  the  U.S.  economy  and  the  longstanding  support
from this committee, this Congress, and most of the aviation community, I sincerely
believe  that  the  impetus  for  NextGen  and  its  program  focus  will  continue  and  not
suffer due to transition activities.

Mr.  Chairman,  this  concludes  my  testimony.  I  would  be  happy  to  answer  any

questions the Committee may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR VICTORIA COX

Vicki  Cox  was  named  the  Air  Traffic  Organization’s  Senior  Vice  President  for
NextGen  and  Operations  Planning  in  May  2008.  She  will  serve  as  the  FAA’s  focal
point for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), working across
all lines of business to lead the transformation of the national airspace system using
state of the art technologies to meet changing aviation demands.

Cox  previously  served  as  the  ATO’s  Vice  President  for  Operations  Planning  since
2006, focusing on moving NextGen forward. She joined the FAA in 2003 as Program
Director  of  the  Aviation  Research  Division,  where  she  made  an  immediate  impact
working on the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) that the Office of Manage-
ment  and  Budget  requires  to  assess  and  improve  program  performance.  Cox  then
moved to Director of Flight Services Finance and Planning before heading the ATO’s
International Office.

Prior  to  joining  the  FAA,  Cox  worked  for  the  Department  of  Defense  where  she

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  GERALD  L.  DILLINGHAM,  DIRECTOR,
PHYSICAL  INFRASTRUCTURE  ISSUES,  GOVERNMENT  AC-
COUNTABILITY OFFICE
Dr.  DILLINGHAM.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Chairman  Costello,
Members of the Committee. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss
the  findings  of  the  study  that  we  undertook  at  your  request  [see
Appendix  2:  Additional  Material  for  the  Record]  and  respond  to
your questions about NextGen planning, research and development
activities.  I  will  also  identify  some  challenges  that  I  believe  must
be overcome to implement NextGen.

The  stakeholders  I  refer  to  in  my  statement  are  the  25  aviation
industry  representatives  we  interviewed  for  our  study  before  the
ATO  was  reorganized  this  past  June.  They  include  avionics,  air-
craft,  and  ATC  equipment  manufacturers,  ATC  system  users,  and
ATC system operators.

I want to note that in contrast to last year when we testified be-
fore this committee, active air traffic controllers are now beginning
to be participants in the NextGen activities.

However, the safety technicians who will be involved in installing
and maintaining NextGen systems have yet to become active stake-
holders.

You  asked  us  about  the  status  and  usefulness  of  three  key
NextGen  planning  documents.  A  majority  of  the  stakeholders  told
us  that  these  documents  were  of  limited  usefulness.  They  said  the
documents provide high-level views of NextGen benefits but do not
include  specific  details  or  a  structured  plan  for  achieving  tangible
results.

However,  our  review  of  the  JPDO’s  next  version  of  the  Work
Plan  shows  progress  in  providing  this  kind  of  information  and
could  make  it  more  useful  for  monitoring  and  the  oversight  of
NextGen.

You  asked  us  about  the  availability  of  R&D  for  NextGen  plan-
ning  and  implementation.  We  found  that  steps  have  been  taken  to
address  some  of  the  initial  concerns  about  the  so-called  R&D  gap
that  resulted  from  changes  in  NASA’s  research  emphasis  and  the
expanding requirements of NextGen.

As  you  know,  the  budget  request  for  FAA  has  increased,  which
will  provide  the  needed  R&D  funding  for  NextGen.  JPDO,  FAA,
and NASA have also begun to move from proposing research to ar-
ticulating  a  defined  and  prioritized  R&D  program  using  mecha-
nisms such as the research transition teams.

However,  even  if  FAA’s  funding  increases,  some  stakeholders
question whether the agency has the R&D infrastructure, including
the facilities and personnel, to adequately address NextGen’s devel-
opmental research needs.

Another  of  your  questions  related  to  the  JPDO’s  capacity  to  co-
ordinate  the  efforts  of  partner  agencies  and  act  as  an  honest
broker.  Since  the  recent  reorganization,  JPDO  is  no  longer  a  sepa-
rate,  independent  office  within  FAA  and  no  longer  reports  directly
to FAA’s top management. Instead, JPDO is a part of ATO, reports
to the Senior Vice President of NextGen, who in turn reports to the
ATO Chief Operation Officer. It is still too soon to know if this gov-
ernance  structure  will  sufficiently  address  stakeholders’  concerns
about NextGen’s leadership.

Under  an  alternative  governance  structure  that  is  included  in
the  House  FAA  Reauthorization  Bill,  the  Director  of  JPDO  would
be  elevated  to  the  Associate  Administrator  of  NextGen,  reporting
directly to the Administrator. We believe this proposal comes closer
to  addressing  concerns  raised  by  stakeholders  than  ATO’s  action
and  could  result  in  another  reorganization  and  governance  struc-
ture with the passage of a reauthorization bill.

However, according to an FAA senior executive, the internal FAA
stakeholders  are  knowledgeable  about  and  supportive  of  the  new
governance  structure.  We  have  suggested  that  FAA  consider  a  fo-
cused  outreach  and  education  initiatives  to  ensure  that  external
stakeholders  also  buy  in  and  support  the  reorganization  and  new
governance structure.

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, in closing I would
like  to  briefly  turn  to  what  I  consider  the  other  key  challenges  to
NextGen  implementation.  First,  to  fully  realize  NextGen  capabili-
ties, a new configuration of ATC infrastructure will be needed. This
means that FAA needs to give priority to developing a comprehen-
sive facility consolidation and realignment plan.

In  addition,  airports  will  need  to  have  increased  capacity.
NextGen  technologies  and  procedures  will  enhance  capacity,  but
additions  to  currently-planned  runway  construction  will  be  nec-
essary to handle the expected increase in traffic. Runway construc-
tion can be a very long and contentious process.

The  final  challenge  remains  for  Congress.  Strong  Congressional
support  will  be  needed  to  advance  a  facility  realignment  proposal
that  may  include  closing  or  consolidating  some  individual  facilities

to  streamline  the  entire  system.  And  Congress  will  be  challenged
to quickly pass a reauthorization bill for FAA, confirm an FAA Ad-
ministrator  and  a  new  Secretary  of  Transportation.  Stable  leader-
ship at the top and adequate funding are necessary for the success
of NextGen.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF GERALD L. DILLINGHAM

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:

I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today’s hearing to discuss the status
of 
issues  associated  with  the  Next  Generation  Air  Transportation  System
(NextGen)—the planned air traffic management system intended to address current
and  anticipated  aviation  congestion.  Today,  the  Nation’s  air  traffic  control  (ATC)
system  is  experiencing  some  of  the  worst  delays  in  recent  times,  with  one  in  four
flights  delayed.  Currently,  the  U.S.  air  transportation  system  handles  roughly
50,000  flights  over  a  24-hour  period.  By  2025,  air  traffic  is  projected  to  double  or
triple,  increasing  to  100,000  to  150,000  flights  every  24  hours.  Stakeholders  ac-
knowledge that the current air transportation system will not be able to meet these
air traffic demands.

Recognizing the need to transform the current system and to prepare for the fore-
casted  growth  in  air  traffic,  Congress  in  2003  mandated  the  creation  of  the  Joint
Planning  and  Development  Office  (JPDO)1 to  conceptualize  and  plan  for  NextGen.
JPDO  works  in  partnership  with  the  Departments  of  Transportation,  Commerce,
Defense (DOD), and Homeland Security (DHS); the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA);  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA);  the  White
House Office of Science and Technology Policy; and the private sector. Housed with-
in FAA—first as an independent office and now, following restructuring, as a compo-
nent of FAA’s Air Traffic Organization (ATO)—JPDO is responsible for coordinating
the  related  efforts  of  these  partners  to  plan  the  transformation  to  NextGen.  JPDO
initially prepared three basic planning documents for NextGen—the Concept of Op-
erations,  Enterprise  Architecture,  and  Integrated  Work  Plan  (IWP)—which,  collec-
tively, form the basis of the joint planning environment for NextGen.

My  statement  today  responds  to  the  six  questions  you  raised  about  NextGen  and
JPDO  and  addresses  two  related  challenges  that  we  have  identified  in  the  course
of  our  work—infrastructure  issues  associated  with  the  configuration  of  ATC  facili-
ties  and  the  capacity  of  airport  runways  and  staffing  issues  related  to  FAA’s  in-
house technical expertise. Your six questions are as follows:

1. Have the views of industry and active air traffic controllers been adequately
incorporated in NextGen plans, such as those embodied in the Concept of Op-
erations, Enterprise Architecture, and IWP?

2. Is the current version of IWP sufficiently detailed and prioritized for effective
use  in  overseeing  and  managing  the  NextGen-related  research  of  multiple
agencies?

3. How confident should Congress be that progress in meeting the research, de-
velopment,  and  testing  activities  set  out  in  IWP  will  provide  a  sufficient
basis  for  achieving  NextGen’s  goals  and  timetable  for  quieter,  cleaner,  and
more efficient air traffic operations?

4. Can the other partner agencies continue to view JPDO as an ‘‘honest broker’’

in light of FAA’s recent restructuring action?

5. What needs to be done to move JPDO from proposing research and develop-
ment  (R&D)  for  NextGen  to  articulating  a  clear  R&D  program  with  defined
and prioritized tasks?

6. What  metrics  should  Congress  use  to  evaluate  the  progress  of  the  NextGen

initiative?

This statement is based on recent related GAO reports and testimonies, including
a report to this committee and other congressional requesters we are issuing today.2

Our  work  on  this  most  recent  report  included  interviewing  25  key  NextGen  stake-
holders about the progress of and challenges to planning for and achieving the tran-
sition  to  NextGen.  We  conducted  this  work  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the work to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for
our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evi-
dence  obtained  provides  a  reasonable  basis  for  our  findings  and  conclusions  based
on our audit objectives.

Background

NextGen is a multi-decade, multi-agency effort to transform the current ATC sys-
tem to the next generation air transportation system by moving from relying largely
on ground-based radars to using precision satellites; digital, networked communica-
tions;  and  an  integrated  weather  system.  Often  characterized  as  ‘‘curb  to  curb,’’
NextGen  involves  every  aspect  of  air  transportation,  from  arrival  at  the  airport  to
departure from the destination airport, and it is expected to increase the safety and
enhance  the  capacity  of  the  air  transport  system.  JPDO  was  charged  with  coordi-
nating the research activities of the federal partner agencies with the goal of devel-
oping  a  20-year  R&D  agenda  for  NextGen.  FAA  will  play  the  central  role  in  imple-
menting  NextGen,  since  it  will  be  responsible  for  acquiring,  integrating,  and  oper-
ating  the  new  ATC  systems.  Industry  stakeholders  will  also  play  a  key  role  in  im-
plementing  NextGen  because  they  are  expected  to  develop,  finance,  and  operate
many  of  the  new  NextGen  systems  that  will  need  to  be  installed  in  aircraft.  FAA
plans to spend roughly $5.4 billion from fiscal years 2009 through 2013 on NextGen
development  and  capital  costs.  JPDO  estimated  that  total  federal  spending  for
NextGen  may  range  from  $15  billion  to  $22  billion  through  2025.  The  agency  also
noted that it expects system users to incur $14 billion to $20 billion in costs to equip
themselves with the advanced avionics necessary to realize the full benefits of some
NextGen technologies.

JPDO’s  authorizing  legislation  requires  the  office  to  create  an  R&D  plan  for  the
transition to NextGen. This requirement led JPDO to develop initial versions of the
Concept  of  Operations,  Enterprise  Architecture,  and  IWP.  The  Concept  of  Oper-
ations  is  the  fundamental  planning  document  from  which  the  other  two  documents
flow.  Version  2  of  the  Concept  of  Operations,  issued  in  June  2007,  describes  how
the  NextGen  system  is  envisioned  to  operate  in  2025.  Version  2  of  the  Enterprise
Architecture, issued in July 2007, is a technical description of the NextGen system,
akin to blueprints for a building. The Enterprise Architecture provides a means for
coordinating among the partner agencies and private sector manufacturers, aligning
relevant  R&D  activities,  and  integrating  equipment.  Version  0.2  of  IWP  describes
the integrated framework needed to transition to NextGen from the current system
to the end state and will continually be refined and enhanced to reflect current pri-
orities, budgets, and programs. It is JPDO’s plan for achieving NextGen. Version 1.0
of IWP is scheduled to be released at the end of this month.

Have the Views of Industry and Air Traffic Controllers Been Adequately In-

corporated in NextGen Planning Documents?

JPDO, FAA, and industry stakeholders have different perspectives on whether the
views  of  industry  and  air  traffic  controllers  have  been  adequately  incorporated  in
NextGen planning. JPDO’s organizational structure and processes provide for indus-
try  representatives  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  air  traffic  controllers  to  participate  in
NextGen  planning,  but  nearly  all  the  industry  stakeholders  we  spoke  with  ques-
tioned  both  the  meaningfulness  of  their  involvement  and  the  usefulness  of  the
NextGen  planning  documents.  Furthermore,  active  air  traffic  controllers  maintain
that  they  have  not  participated  in  NextGen  development  activities.  According  to
FAA,  however,  their  involvement  will  increase  as  NextGen  efforts  shift  from  plan-
ning to implementation.

JPDO includes several organizations with industry participants, and industry rep-
resentatives  have  reviewed  and  provided  input  to  key  JPDO  planning  documents.

For example, JPDO’s NextGen Institute serves as a vehicle for incorporating the ex-
pertise  of  industry,  State  and  local  governments,  and  academia  into  the  NextGen
planning  process.  Additionally,  the  Institute  Management  Council,  composed  of  top
officials  and  representatives  from  the  aviation  community,  including  air  traffic  con-
trollers,  oversees  the  policies,  recommendations,  and  products  of  the  Institute  and
provides  a  means  for  advancing  consensus  positions  on  critical  NextGen  issues.
JPDO also includes nine working groups,3 through which federal and private sector
stakeholders  come  together  to  plan  for  and  coordinate  the  development  of  NextGen
technologies.  JDPO  created  the  working  groups  in  early  2007  to  replace  its  inte-
grated  product  teams  and,  in  part,  to  address  concerns  expressed  by  stakeholders
about  their  participation.  Unlike  the  previous  teams,  which  were  chaired  by  a  rep-
resentative  from  a  federal  agency,  the  working  groups,  which  have  the  same  mem-
bers as the previous teams, are jointly led by government and industry officials. (See
Table  1.)  JPDO  expected  the  working  groups  to  be  more  efficient  and  output-  or
product-focused  than  the  integrated  product  teams.  Currently,  265  industry  rep-
resentatives participate in JPDO. In addition, JPDO provided a draft of the Concept
of Operations and IWP to industry representatives for review and comment. For ex-
ample,  version  0.2  ofIWP  was  circulated  to  stakeholders  and,  according  to  a  senior
JPDO official, the office received about 1,100 stakeholder comments, which were ad-
dressed and incorporated in version 1.0 of the document.

3 The nine working groups are Airport, Security, Air Navigation Services, Aircraft, Net-centric

Operations, Safety, Environment, Weather, and Global Harmonization.

37

With  these  efforts,  JPDO  has  sought  to  obtain  participation  from  industry  stake-
holders  and  air  traffic  controllers  in  its  planning  activities,  and  we  have  reported
that  many  stakeholders  felt  they  did  have  an  opportunity  to  participate.4 In  fact,
one  industry  stakeholder  group  told  us  that  it  worked  closely  with  JPDO  to  help
revise  an  early  version  of  the  Concept  of  Operations.  However,  other  stakeholders
said  they  frequently  attended  meetings,  but  were  frustrated  by  a  lack  of  tangible
products being developed and a lack of progress being made during these meetings.
Furthermore, 13 of 15 stakeholders who discussed the issue stated that they did not
feel  that  their  level  of  participation  in  either  JPDO’s  planning  for  or  FAA’s  imple-
mentation  of  NextGen  allowed  for  sufficient  or  meaningful  input  toward  decision-
making.  Some  stakeholders  expressed  concern  that  JPDO  and  FAA  did  not  include
their input in planning documents and other products. In their view, critical issues
they raised are not being addressed or incorporated in NextGen plans. In particular,
some  stakeholders  noted  that  planning  documents  were  drafted  by  JPDO  staff  and
then provided to them for review and comment. This approach, one industry stake-
holder  noted,  did  not  take  full  advantage  of  stakeholders’  capabilities.  Others  were
critical of FAA’s decision-making structure for implementing NextGen and indicated
they  felt  that  FAA  and  JPDO  should  lay  out  the  broad  plans  and  schedules  for
NextGen  and  then  obtain  industry  input  on  the  best  ways  to  accomplish  the  tech-
nical changes for NextGen. Another stakeholder indicated it had the opportunity to
provide input to FAA on decisions such as the deployment of ADS–B technology, but
did  not  feel  its  input  was  considered  by  the  agency.  Still  others  felt  that  FAA  pro-
vided sufficient briefings on NextGen activities, but allowed no opportunity for their
input or comments.

A number of stakeholders also expressed concerns about the usefulness of JPDO’s
three  planning  documents  and  of  FAA’s  implementation  plan  for  NextGen  (a  docu-
ment  previously  known  as  the  Operational  Evolution  Partnership  and  now  called
the  NextGen  Implementation  Plan).  Nineteen  of  21  industry  stakeholders  who  dis-
cussed  the  issue  said  that  these  planning  documents  lack  the  information  that  in-
dustry participants need for successful planning. Many of the stakeholders we inter-
viewed  said  that  while  the  planning  documents  provide  a  high-level  view  of
NextGen  benefits,  they  do  not  provide  specific  details  such  as  a  catalog  of  critical
needs, clearly defined and prioritized intermediate objectives, and a structured plan
for  achieving  tangible  results.  According  to  stakeholders  who  manufacture  aviation
equipment,  the  plans  lack  specific  details  to  inform  them  about  the  types  of  tech-
nology they need to design for NextGen or to provide insights to market, build, and
install  systems  that  support  NextGen.  Some  industry  stakeholders  further  noted
that the current planning does not identify all of the key research for NextGen, es-
tablish priorities for R&D, or show how to obtain those results. In addition, several
stakeholders characterized the documents as long and confusing—qualities that de-
tracted  from  their  usefulness.  We  agree  that  the  latest  publicly  available  versions
of  these  documents  lack  information  that  various  stakeholders  need.  For  example,
the  documents  do  not  include  key  elements  such  as  scenarios  illustrating  NextGen
operations;  a  summary  of  NextGen’s  operational  impact  on  users  and  other  stake-
holders;  and  an  analysis  of  the  benefits,  alternatives,  and  trade-offs  that  were  con-
sidered  for  NextGen.  Our  review  of  the  upcoming  version  of  IWP  confirmed  that  it
is  to  have  information  that  is  lacking  in  the  current  document.  According  to  JPDO
and FAA officials, it includes schedule information that has been updated to reflect
newly  available  information,  coordination  with  FAA’s  schedule  and  plans,  and  revi-
sions  in  response  to  public  comments  received  on  the  previous  version.  In  addition,
a senior JPDO official noted and we agree that these documents are not the appro-
priate  place  for  some  of  the  detailed  information  stakeholders  would  like  and  need,
such  as  specific  information  on  the  types  of  technology  stakeholders  need  to  design
or install.

Active  air  traffic  controllers  are  represented  on  JPDO’s  Institute  Management
Council,  and  other  controllers  and  aviation  technicians  participate  in  certain  JPDO
efforts.  However,  stakeholders  from  the  National  Air  Traffic  Controllers  Associa-
tion—an FAA employee union—have indicated that although the union participates
in FAA meetings and briefings related to NextGen, it does so as a recipient of infor-
mation  rather  than  an  equal  party  in  the  development  of  NextGen.  Technicians  in
another  FAA  employee  union—the  Professional  Aviation  Safety  Specialists—have
indicated  that  they  do  not  participate  in  NextGen  planning  or  development  activi-
ties.  Although  air  traffic  controllers  and  technicians  will  be  responsible  for  a  major
part  of  the  installation,  operations,  and  maintenance  of  the  systems  that  NextGen
will  comprise,  our  work  has  shown  that  these  stakeholders  have  not  fully  partici-
pated in the development of NextGen. Insufficient participation on the part of these

employees  could  delay  the  certification  and  integration  of  new  systems  and  result
in increased costs, as we have seen in previous ATC modernization efforts.

FAA  officials,  however,  note  that  both  unions  are  represented  on  its  NextGen
Management Board, a decision-making body for resolving emerging NextGen imple-
mentation issues. Furthermore, FAA has indicated that air traffic controllers, pilots,
and  airline  operations  center  personnel  will  be  a  part  of  the  extended  team  that  is
directly  involved  in  the  planning  and  execution  of  a  gradual  roll-out  of  NextGen
technologies  and  procedures  in  a  Florida  demonstration.  In  addition,  according  to
FAA, these stakeholders will continue to be heavily involved in NextGen throughout
its life cycle through their participation on advisory committees such as RTCA,5 the
Air  Traffic  Management  Advisory  Committee,6 the  Performance-Based  Operations
Aviation Rule-making Committee,7 and the Research, Engineering and Development
Advisory Committee.8

FAA  and  JPDO  have  established  mechanisms  for  obtaining  stakeholder  views.
However, given the large number of NextGen stakeholders and the evolution of op-
portunities for participation in NextGen, we believe that stakeholders will continue
to  differ  on  how  adequately  their  views  have  been  incorporated  in  NextGen  plan-
ning.

Is  the  Current  Version  of  IWP  Sufficiently  Detailed  for  Effective  Use  in

Overseeing and Managing NextGen?

Our work indicates that the current version of the IWP lacks critical information
and  is  not  sufficiently  ‘‘user  friendly’’  to  be  effectively  used  to  oversee  and  manage
NextGen activities. For instance, 19 of the 21 stakeholders who discussed the issue
said  that  the  planning  documents  did  not  provide  specific  details  such  as  a  catalog
of critical needs, clearly defined and prioritized intermediate objectives, and a struc-
tured  plan  for  achieving  tangible  results.  However,  the  next  version  of  the  plan,  to
be  released  at  the  end  of  September,  is  to  have  further  details  and  research  prior-
ities  that  should  be  useful  for  NextGen  oversight.  According  to  senior  JPDO  offi-
cials, this next version will identify the specific operational improvements and capa-
bilities  that  NextGen  will  incorporate  and  will  show  what  policies,  research,  and
other  activities  are  needed  to  enable  those  improvements  and  capabilities,  when
they are needed, and what entities are responsible for them. Moreover, this version
includes  schedule  information  that  has  been  updated  to  reflect  newly  available  in-
formation,  coordination  with  FAA  schedules  and  plans,  and  public  comments  re-
ceived on the previous version, according to JPDO and FAA officials. Our review of
the upcoming version—which is an automated, searchable, user-friendly database—
verified  that  it  will  have  the  capability  to  track  dates  and  identify  programs  that
are behind schedule, making it useful, but not sufficient, for oversight.

Senior  JPDO  officials  expect  subsequent  versions  of  IWP  to  include  cost  informa-
tion  and  more  detail  on  which  programs  are  responsible  for  completing  particular
actions.  We  believe  that  JPDO’s  upcoming  version  of  the  work  plan  shows  progress
in  providing  needed  details  and  making  the  document  more  useful  than  earlier
versions.  With  cost  information,  subsequent  versions  of  the  plan  should  be  even
more useful for NextGen oversight.

How  Confident  Should  Congress  Be  that  IWP  Will  Provide  a  Sufficient

Basis for Achieving NextGen’s Goals?

The  research,  development,  and  testing  activities  set  out  in  the  current  IWP  do
not provide a sufficient basis for Congress to be confident that the goals of NextGen
will  be  achieved.  However,  the  enhanced  information  that  is  planned  for  inclusion
in the upcoming version will provide a firmer basis for congressional confidence. The
current plan can best be viewed as a necessary but not a sufficient step in the plan-
ning and early implementation of NextGen. However, additional issues that are not
part  of  the  current  plan  will  have  to  be  addressed  to  achieve  NextGen  goals,  such

as  obtaining  the  necessary  funding,  establishing  the  infrastructure  to  support  the
scope of needed R&D, and filling the gap that may exist between basic research and
the  research  needed  to  bring  technologies  far  enough  along  for  transfer  to  industry
for further development.

JPDO  and  FAA  have  determined  that  research  gaps  now  exist  because  of  cuts  in
NASA’s  aeronautical  research  funding  and  NextGen’s  expanded  research  require-
ments. In the past, NASA performed a significant portion of aeronautics R&D. How-
ever,  NASA’s  aeronautic  research  budget  declined  from  about  $959  million  in  fiscal
year 2004 to $511 million in fiscal year 2008. While NASA still plans to focus some
of  its  research  on  NextGen  needs,  the  agency  has  moved  toward  a  focus  on  funda-
mental research and away from developmental work and demonstration projects. As
a  result,  in  some  cases,  NASA’s  research  focuses  on  developing  technologies  to  a
lower—and therefore less readily adopted—maturity level than in the past.

Budget requests for FAA have increased to help provide the needed R&D funding
for  NextGen.  According  to  FAA,  the  agency  will  spend  an  estimated  $740  million
on  NextGen-related  R&D  during  fiscal  years  2009  through  2013.  The  administra-
tion’s  proposed  budget  for  fiscal  year  2009  requests  $56.5  million  for  FAA  R&D  to
support the integration and implementation of NextGen programs, a substantial in-
crease  over  the  $24.3  million  authorized  for  fiscal  year  2008.  The  actual  and  pro-
jected  increase  in  FAA’s  overall  R&D  funding  reflects  the  expected  increases  in
NextGen research funding. (See Fig. 1.) In addition, increased funding for NextGen
R&D is contained in proposed legislation to reauthorize FAA, although that legisla-
tion has not been enacted.

If FAA is authorized to receive increased R&D funding for NextGen, some observ-
ers believe that the agency lacks the R&D infrastructure to adequately address the
developmental research needed for NextGen. According to a draft report by the Re-
search,  Engineering  and  Development  Advisory  Committee,  establishing  the  infra-
structure within FAA to conduct the necessary R&D could delay the implementation
of  NextGen  by  five  years.  Unless  an  adequate  R&D  infrastructure  is  in  place  as
funds become available, the implementation of NextGen could be delayed.

One  critical  area  in  which  an  R&D  gap  has  been  identified  is  the  environmental
impact of aviation. According to a JPDO analysis, environmental impacts will be the
primary  constraint  on  the  capacity  and  flexibility  of  the  national  airspace  system
unless these impacts are managed and mitigated. FAA’s Continuous Lower Energy,
Emissions,  and  Noise  (CLEEN)  initiative,  in  which  NASA  would  participate  as  an
adviser,  is  intended  to  address  the  gap  between  NASA’s  fundamental  research  in
noise  reduction  and  the  need  for  near-term  demonstrations  of  technology.  This  pro-
gram would establish a research consortium of government, industry, and academic

participants  that  would  allow  for  the  maturation  of  these  technologies  via  dem-
onstration projects.9 In proposed legislation reauthorizing FAA, $111 million for fis-
cal years 2008 through 2011 may be used for a new FAA program to reduce aviation
noise  and  emissions.10 This  program  would,  over  the  next  10  years,  facilitate  the
development, maturation, and certification of improved airframe technologies.

The  CLEEN  program  would  be  a  step  toward  further  maturing  emissions  and
noise reduction technologies, but experts agree that the proposed funding is insuffi-
cient  to  achieve  needed  emissions  reductions.  While  acknowledging  that  CLEEN
would help bridge the gap between NASA’s R&D and manufacturers’ eventual incor-
poration  of  technologies  into  aircraft  designs,  aeronautics  industry  representatives
and  experts  we  consulted  said  that  the  program’s  funding  levels  may  not  be  suffi-
cient  to  attain  the  goals  specified  in  the  proposal.  According  to  these  experts,  the
proposed  funding  levels  would  allow  for  the  further  development  of  one  or  possibly
two  projects.  Moreover,  in  one  expert’s  view,  the  funding  for  these  projects  may  be
sufficient  to  develop  the  technology  only  to  the  level  that  achieves  an  emissions-re-
duction  goal  in  testing,  not  to  the  level  required  for  the  technology  to  be  incor-
porated  into  a  new  engine  design.  Although  we  believe  that  this  level  of  funding  is
a  step  in  the  right  direction,  additional  funds  would  permit  the  agency  to  ‘‘buy
down’’  R&D  risks—that  is,  the  more  projects  that  can  be  funded,  the  greater  the
chance  that  at  least  one  of  the  projects  will  yield  a  product  for  the  next  stage  of
development. FAA recognizes the implications of the proposed funding structure for
CLEEN and characterizes the program as a ‘‘pilot.’’

We  are  guardedly  optimistic  that  the  NextGen  goals  and  timetable  for  quieter,

cleaner, and more efficient air traffic operations can be achieved.

The  administration  has  requested  increased  funding  for  NextGen  R&D  and  FAA
and  JPDO  recognize  the  need  to  establish  an  R&D  infrastructure  and  fill  any  gaps
that may exist between basic research and the transfer to industry for further devel-
opment.

Can JPDO Continue to Be Viewed as an ‘‘Honest Broker’’ in Light of FAA’s

Recent Restructuring?

Prior  to  May  2008,  when  FAA  restructured  ATO,  JPDO  reported  directly  to  both
the  Chief  Operating  Officer  (COO)  of  ATO  and  the  FAA  Administrator.  Figure  2
shows  FAA’s  management  structure  as  of  November  2007,  with  the  shaded  boxes
showing  offices  with  responsibilities  for  NextGen  activities.  We  expressed  concerns
about  this  dual  reporting  status,  suggesting  that  it  might  keep  JPDO  from  inter-
acting  on  an  equal  footing  with  ATO  and  the  other  partner  federal  agencies.11 We
recognized that JPDO needed to counter the perception that it was a proxy for ATO
and, as such, was not able to act as an ‘‘honest broker’’ between ATO and the part-
ner federal agencies, but we also understood that JPDO must continue to work with
ATO  and  its  partner  agencies  in  a  partnership  in  which  ATO  is  the  lead  imple-
menter of NextGen. Therefore, we reported that it was important for JPDO to have
some independence from ATO and pointed out that, to address this issue, the JPDO
Director  could  report  directly  to  the  FAA  Administrator.  We  observed  that  such  a
change could also lessen what some stakeholders perceived as unnecessary bureauc-
racy  and  red  tape  associated  with  decision-making  and  other  JPDO  and  NextGen
processes.

Since ATO was reorganized in May 2008, JPDO has been housed within the new
NextGen and Operations Planning Office and reports through the Senior Vice Presi-
dent  for  NextGen  and  Operations  Planning  only  to  ATO’s  COO.  (See  Fig.  3.)  Now
that  JPDO  is  no  longer  a  separate,  independent  office  within  FAA  and  no  longer
reports  directly  to  the  FAA  Administrator,  its  organizational  position  within  FAA
has  declined.  Nonetheless,  we  believe  that  it  is  too  early  to  tell  whether  JPDO  will
be  able  to  act  as  an  ‘‘honest  broker’’  between  FAA  and  the  other  federal  partner
agencies.  Currently,  according  to  a  senior  JPDO  official,  JPDO’s  partner  agencies
are  cooperating  with  JPDO,  indicating  that  the  office  is  apparently  maintaining  its
status as an honest broker.

42

However,  it  is  also  too  early  to  tell  if  ATO’s  reorganization  sufficiently  addresses
concerns that many industry stakeholders expressed about the adequacy of the pre-
vious organizational relationship between FAA and JPDO—when JPDO reported di-
rectly  to  both  the  COO  and  the  Administrator—for  the  transition  to  NextGen.  Pro-
posed  legislation  reauthorizing  FAA  would  address  the  earlier  concern  of  stake-
holders by designating the Director of JPDO as the Associate Administrator for the
Next Generation Air Transportation System, appointed by and reporting directly to
the  Administrator.12 The  proposed  legislation  would  also  address  observations  we
have made about JPDO’s organizational placement within FAA.

Finally, it is too early to tell if the reorganization of FAA’s management structure
addresses  concerns  that  stakeholders  have  expressed  about  the  fragmentation  of
management responsibility for NextGen activities. Specifically, some industry stake-
holders  expressed  frustration  that  a  program  as  large  and  important  as  NextGen
does  not  follow  the  industry  practice  of  having  one  person  authorized  to  make  key
decisions.  They  pointed  out  that  although  FAA’s  COO  is  nominally  in  charge  of
FAA’s NextGen efforts, the COO must also manage the agency’s day-to-day air traf-
fic  operations  and  may  therefore  be  unable  to  devote  enough  time  and  attention  to
managing  NextGen.  In  addition,  these  stakeholders  noted  that  many  of  NextGen’s
capabilities  span  FAA  operational  units  both  within  and  outside  ATO.  The  reorga-
nization  does  not  address  concerns  about  this  fragmentation,  since  other  offices  in
ATO and FAA continue to have responsibility for parts of NextGen and the division
of responsibility for NextGen efforts among them is not clear. A senior FAA official
noted that ATO executives are knowledgeable and supportive of the reorganization,
but  that  the  agency  could  better  communicate  the  changes  to  stakeholders  outside
of  FAA.  A  focused  outreach  to  industry  stakeholders  would  help  to  get  their  buy-
in and support of FAA’s efforts.

What Needs to Be Done to Move JPDO from Proposing R&D to Articulating

a Clear R&D Program with Defined and Prioritized Tasks?

43

To articulate a clear R&D program with defined and prioritized tasks, JPDO must
continue  to  collaborate  with  its  partner  agencies—FAA,  NASA,  DOD,  DHS,  and
Commerce—to identify and prioritize the R&D needed for NextGen. As it issues new
versions of IWP, JPDO continues to update the R&D plans of the partner agencies.
However,  JPDO  has  not  yet  determined  what  NextGen  R&D  needs  to  be  done  first
and  at  what  cost  to  demonstrate  and  integrate  NextGen  technologies  into  the  na-
tional airspace system. The next version of IWP, scheduled to be released later this
month,  is  to  identify  the  sequence  of  research  activities  that  the  partner  agencies
must  complete  before  specific  NextGen  capabilities  can  be  implemented.  The  plan
should serve as a useful tool in prioritizing and tracking NextGen research. In addi-
tion,  JPDO  has  worked  with  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB)  to  de-
velop  a  process  that  allows  OMB  to  identify  NextGen-related  research  and  acquisi-
tion  projects  across  the  partner  agencies  and  consider  NextGen  as  a  unified,  cross-
agency  program.  Under  this  process,  JPDO  and  its  partner  agencies  can  jointly
present OMB with business cases for the partner agencies’ NextGen-related efforts,
and  these  business  cases  can  be  used  as  inputs  to  funding  decisions  for  NextGen
research and acquisitions across the agencies.

In addition, JPDO needs to continue to leverage the R&D programs of the partner
agencies,  which  will  conduct  and  define  the  research.  For  example,  JPDO  monitors
NASA’s  and  FAA’s  efforts  to  coordinate  their  research.  NASA  and  FAA  have  devel-
oped  a  strategy  to  identify,  conduct,  and  transfer  to  FAA  the  R&D  needed  for
NextGen.  The  strategy  establishes  four  ‘‘research  transition  teams’’ 13 that  align
with JPDO’s planning framework and outlines how the two agencies will jointly de-
velop  research  requirements—FAA  will  provide  user  requirements  and  NASA  will
conduct the research and provide an understanding of the engineering rationale for
design decisions. In addition, the strategy calls for clearly defining metrics for evalu-
ating the research. According to JPDO, as of August 2008, four teams had been es-
tablished and have conducted initial meetings.

JPDO  has  begun  to  move  from  proposing  research  to  articulating  a  defined  and
prioritized  R&D  program.  In  addition,  JPDO,  FAA,  and  NASA  have  established
mechanisms,  such  as  research  transition  teams,  to  define  and  prioritize  R&D.  We
believe, however, that it is still too early to assess the adequacy of these efforts.

What  Metrics  Should  Congress  Use  to  Evaluate  the  Progress  of  NextGen?
Version 1.0 of IWP, scheduled to be released later this month, will provide a base-
line  for  measuring  NextGen  progress.  Congress  can  use  the  information  contained
in the plan to help evaluate whether the actions needed to achieve NextGen are on
schedule  and  whether  the  specific  operational  improvements  and  capabilities  that
will  make  up  NextGen  are  being  accomplished.  Specifically,  subsequent  versions  of
the  plan  will  allow  the  development  of  metrics  to  show  progress,  by  agency,  in  (1)
achieving key activities and deploying technology, (2) issuing policies and guidance,
and (3) prioritizing resources.

Furthermore, subsequent versions of IWP are expected to include cost information
that  decision-makers  can  use  to  help  understand  the  rationale  for  budget  requests,
monitor  costs,  and  improve  future  cost  estimates  for  acquisitions.  This  information
will  be  helpful  to  decision-makers  when  budget  constraints  do  not  allow  all  system
acquisitions to be fully funded at planned and approved levels and they must decide
which programs to fund and which to cut or delay according to their priorities.

Two Related Challenges

At  this  point,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  briefly  discuss  two  additional  issues
that present challenges to realizing the full potential of NextGen. The first, an infra-
structure challenge, is to implement NextGen plans for a new configuration of ATC
facilities  and  enhanced  runway  capacity.  The  second,  a  human  capital  challenge,  is
to  ensure  that  FAA  staff  have  the  knowledge  and  skills  needed  to  implement
NextGen.

To  fully  realize  NextGen’s  capabilities,  a  new  configuration  of  ATC  facilities  and
enhanced  runway  capacity  will  be  required  to  go  along  with  new  technologies  and
procedures. According to a senior ATO official, the agency plans to report on the cost
implications of reconfiguring its facilities in 2009. However, FAA has no comprehen-
sive  plan  for  reconfiguring  its  facilities.  Until  the  cost  analysis  is  completed  and  a

13 The  four  teams  are  organized  along  the  framework  for  near-,  mid-,  and  long-term  research
goals  established  in  JPDO’s  IWP.  The  teams  are  Separation  Management,  Trajectory  Manage-
ment, Flow Contingency Management, and Capacity Management.

44

plan  for  facilities  reconfiguration  has  been  developed,  the  configurations  needed  for
NextGen  cannot  be  implemented  and  potential  savings  that  could  help  offset  the
cost of NextGen will not be realized. Some FAA officials have said that planned fa-
cility  maintenance  and  construction  based  on  the  current  ATC  system  are  signifi-
cant  cost  drivers  that  could,  without  reconfiguration,  significantly  increase  the  cost
of  NextGen.  Additionally,  some  of  the  capacity  and  efficiency  enhancements  ex-
pected  from  the  implementation  of  NextGen  maybe  curtailed  if  the  system’s  infra-
structure needs are not fully addressed.

In  the  meantime,  FAA  faces  an  immediate  task  to  maintain  and  repair  existing
facilities  so  that  the  current  ATC  system  continues  to  operate  safely  and  reliably.
The  agency  is  currently  responsible  for  maintaining  over  400  terminal  facilities.
While FAA has not assessed the physical condition of all of these facilities, the agen-
cy  rated  the  average  condition  of  89  of  them  as  ‘‘fair.’’  Based  on  its  assessment  of
these  89  facilities,  FAA  estimated  that  a  one-time  cost  to  repair  all  400  terminal
facilities would range from $250 million to $350 million. Two FAA employee unions
(NATCA  and  PASS)  contend  that  many  of  the  400  facilities  are  deteriorating  for
lack  of  maintenance  and  that  working  conditions  are  unsafe  because  of  leaking
roofs,  deteriorating  walls  and  ceilings,  and  obsolete  air-conditioning  systems.  Ac-
cording  to  FAA  officials,  while  some  of  these  facilities  can  accommodate  NextGen’s
new technologies and systems, many of them are not consistent with the configura-
tions that will be needed under NextGen. Once FAA develops and implements a fa-
cility  consolidation  plan,  the  costs  of  facility  repairs  and  maintenance  may  be  re-
duced.  In  the  meantime,  FAA  will  have  to  manage  its  budgetary  resources  so  that
it  can  maintain  legacy  systems  and  legacy  infrastructure  while  configuring  the  na-
tional airspace system to accommodate NextGen technologies and operations.

The transformation to NextGen will also depend on the ability of airports to han-
dle  greater  capacity.  While  NextGen  technologies  and  procedures  will  enhance  this
ability,  new  or  expanded  runways  will  likely  be  needed  also  to  handle  the  expected
increases  in  traffic.  FAA  has  developed  a  rolling  10-year  plan  for  capacity  improve-
ments  at  the  Nation’s  35  busiest  airports,  and  some  airports  are  building  new  run-
ways. However, even with these planned runway improvements, FAA analyses indi-
cate that 14 more airports will still need additional capacity. Moreover, without sig-
nificant  reductions  in  emissions  and  noise  around  some  of  the  Nation’s  airports,  ef-
forts to expand their capacity could be stalled or the implementation of NextGen de-
layed.  We  believe  that  this  is  a  significant  issue  that  FAA  and  JPDO  will  have  to
address.

To  manage  the  implementation  of  NextGen,  FAA  will  need  staff  with  technical
skills,  such  as  systems  engineering  and  contract  management  expertise.  Because  of
the scope and complexity of the NextGen effort, the agency may not currently have
the  in-house  expertise  to  manage  the  transition  to  NextGen  without  assistance.  In
November 2006, we recommended that FAA assess the technical and contract man-
agement  skills  FAA  staff  will  need  to  define,  implement,  and  integrate  the  numer-
ous  complex  programs  that  will  be  involved  in  the  transition  to  NextGen.14 In  re-
sponse to our recommendation, FAA contracted with the National Academy of Public
Administration  (NAPA)  to  determine  the  mix  of  skills  and  number  of  skilled  per-
sons,  such  as  technical  personnel  and  program  managers,  needed  to  implement
NextGen  and  to  compare  those  requirements  with  FAA’s  current  staff  resources.
NAPA  expects  to  complete  its  assessment  in  September  2008.  We  believe  this  is  a
reasonable  approach  that  should  help  FAA  begin  to  address  this  issue,  recognizing
that  once  the  right  skills  have  been  identified,  it  may  take  considerable  time  to  se-
lect,  hire,  and  integrate  what  FAA  estimates  could  be  150  to  200  more  staff.  This
situation  could  contribute  to  delaying  the  integration  of  new  technologies  and  the
transformation of the national airspace system.

Mr.  Chairman,  this  concludes  my  prepared  statement.  I  would  be  pleased  to  re-

spond to any questions that you or other Members of the Committee may have.

STATEMENT  OF  THE  HONORABLE  CALVIN  L.  SCOVEL  III,  IN-
SPECTOR  GENERAL,  U.S.  DEPARTMENT  OF  TRANSPOR-
TATION
Mr. SCOVEL. Chairman Gordon, Ranking Member Hall, Members
of the Committee, we appreciate the opportunity to discuss the sta-
tus  of  FAA’s  efforts  to  develop  NextGen.  This  is  a  high-risk  effort
involving  billion  dollar  investments  from  the  government  and  air
space users who will be expected to equip with new avionics. Today
we will address four points.

First, FAA is at a crossroads with modernizing the National Air-
space System. The agency faces challenges to keep existing systems
on  track,  maintain  aging  facilities,  and  develop  and  implement
NextGen  initiatives.  As  we  reported  in  April,  30  existing  projects
form  platforms  for  NextGen,  and  over  20  critical  decisions  need  to
be made over the next two years that have enormous budgetary im-
plications.

To help bridge the transition from today’s system to a vastly dif-
ferent NextGen, we recommended that FAA conduct a gap analysis
of  the  current  NextGen  Systems  and  develop  an  interim  architec-
ture  for  the  2015  timeframe.  FAA  is  taking  steps  to  address  our
recommendations.

Second, significant issues related to resource alignment, research
priority,  and  policy  questions  that  will  materially  affect  the  cost
and  schedule  for  NextGen  need  to  be  addressed.  A  key  issue  fo-
cuses  on  NASA’s  work  to  develop  advanced  NextGen  software  for
boosting controller productivity.

NASA R&D is fairly well aligned with JPDO plans but falls short
with respect to validating new software and linking airport arrival
and departures. We found that FAA, DOD, and DHS need to reach
an  agreement  on  NextGen  security  and  surveillance  issues.  Work
is  also  needed  to  reconcile  differences  on  new  weather  systems  in-
cluding the new 4–D Weather Cube, a simple database for weather
observations.

In  addition,  attention  is  needed  to  make  sure  human  factors  re-
search for controllers and pilots is effectively linked to ensure that
NextGen capabilities can be safely implemented.

Third, how FAA is organized to manage and execute NextGen is
an important matter. FAA’s decision to place the JPDO within the
ATO  could  help  in  implementing  NextGen.  It  has  the  benefit  of
placing  developmental  efforts  much  closer  to  the  people  who  will
use new systems.

However,  it  gives  the  appearance  that  JPDO  has  been  reduced
in  status  and  importance.  We  think  it’s  premature  to  judge  the
change,  but  we  found  that  FAA  needs  to  clarify  roles  and  respon-

sibilities  among  offices,  the  JPDO  and  the  new  ATO  NextGen  Of-
fice for implementation and integration.

Further,  budget  authority  for  NextGen  efforts  remains  frag-
mented  among  FAA  lines  of  business.  How  to  best  organize  FAA
is a policy call for Congress. We think FAA will have to revisit the
governance of NextGen once it has a clearer picture of what it will
take to deliver NextGen.

Finally, a number of actions are needed from FAA going forward
to help NextGen efforts from research to implementation. NextGen
will  be  a  front  and  center  issue  for  the  next  Congress  and  a  top
management challenge for the new Administration. We have made
numerous  recommendations  to  FAA  aimed  at  reducing  risks  with
NextGen. They focused on funding targeted human factors research
and acquiring the skill sets needed to execute NextGen.

At  this  juncture  a  number  of  additional  actions  are  needed,  and
I  will  highlight  five.  Action  item  number  one.  Establish  priorities
and  reflect  them  in  budgets  and  plans.  Decision-makers  do  not
have  a  clear  understanding  of  what  to  invest  in  first.  FAA  should
provide  this  committee  with  its  priorities  for  NextGen  R&D,  how
research gaps will be addressed, and how priorities will be updated
as they evolve.

Action item two. Develop a strategy for technology transfer. This
is  critical  to  the  JPDO’s  mission.  FAA  has  established  research
transition teams for NASA work but not for other areas. Our work
shows  that  this  needs  more  attention.  Clearly-defined  exit  criteria
and  hand-off  points  would  help  transition  new  technologies  into
day-to-day use.

Action  item  three.  Focus  attention  on  airport  issues  and  how
NextGen  technologies  can  unlock  already  congested  airports.  This
should  be  a  top  priority,  and  an  important  metric  for  NextGen
must be the extent to which FAA can improve airport arrival rates
under  all  weather  conditions.  FAA  recognizes  the  importance  and
is  shifting  resources  to  this  issue,  however,  much  work  remains,
and  stakeholders  need  to  know  how  NextGen  elements,  new  sat-
ellite-based  systems,  new  automation,  data  link  communications
can boost airport capacity.

Action  item  four.  Develop  a  realistic  plan  for  ADS–B,  a  center-
piece  of  NextGen.  FAA  has  a  $1.8  billion  contract  in  place  for  this
ground  system  and  has  published  a  proposed  rule  for  the  new  sat-
ellite-based  surveillance  system.  FAA  plans  call  for  users  to  equip
with  ADS–B  OUT  in  the  2020  timeframe,  but  it  is  unclear  when
ADS–B  IN  and  the  related  capacity  related  benefits  can  be  real-
ized.  Concerns  have  been  raised  about  requirements,  the  cost  to
equip, and the lack of clear benefits, all legitimate issues that need
to be addressed.

Action item five. Assess implementation band width and develop
transition  benchmarks.  FAA’s  ability  to  implement  multiple  capa-
bilities in a given time period needs to be assessed. FAA and indus-
try  need  realistic  transition  benchmarks  that  point  to  when  new
training for controllers and pilots, equipment, and procedures need
to be in place at specific locations.

Mr.  Chairman,  that  concludes  my  statement.  I  would  be  happy
to  answer  your  questions,  you  or  other  Members  of  the  Committee
may have.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Scovel follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CALVIN L. SCOVEL III

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:

We  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  discuss  the  status  of  the  Federal  Aviation  Ad-
ministration’s (FAA) efforts to develop the Next Generation Air Transportation Sys-
tem  (NextGen),  which  is  targeted  for  the  2025  timeframe.  In  response  to  congres-
sional direction, FAA created the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) to
develop a vision for NextGen and leverage research at other federal agencies.

As the Committee is aware, there are a number of compelling reasons for moving
forward with NextGen. The current air transportation system has served the Nation
well over the years, but ‘‘business as usual’’ will not be sufficient to meet the antici-
pated  demand  for  air  travel  or  significantly  reduce  delays  at  already  congested  air-
ports.

Currently,  the  U.S.  airline  industry  is  facing  considerable  financial  uncertainty
due  to  a  softening  economy  and  skyrocketing  fuel  prices.  In  response,  airlines  are
reducing  schedules  and  taking  aircraft  out  of  service.  Notwithstanding  the  state  of
the  industry,  it  is  important  to  move  forward  with  NextGen.  FAA  is  revising  its
forecast but still projects that the demand for air travel will grow to more than one
billion passengers by 2016.

NextGen goals are ambitious but important to the health of the U.S. air transpor-
tation  system  and  the  Nation’s  economy.  NextGen  is  expected  to  triple  capacity,
boost  controller  productivity,  reduce  FAA  operating  costs,  lessen  impact  of  high  en-
ergy costs, and reduce the environmental impact of aviation.

Developing  NextGen  is  one  the  biggest  challenges  facing  FAA.  It  is  a  high-risk
effort  involving  billion-dollar  investments  from  both  the  Government  (for  new
ground systems) and airspace users (for new avionics). FAA plans to spend $18 bil-
lion for its capital programs between fiscal years (FY) 2008 and 2013, including $5.6
billion  specifically  for  NextGen.  The  challenges  are  multi-dimensional  and  involve
complex  software  development  and  integration,  adjustments  to  existing  air  traffic
systems, technology transfer, workforce changes, and policy questions about aircraft
equipage.

This  past  year,  some  stakeholders  expressed  concern  that  NextGen  efforts  lacked
a  sense  of  urgency  and  a  clear  plan  for  what  could  be  done  in  the  near-,  mid-,  and
long-term.  The  Secretary  of  Transportation  is  working  to  clarify  NextGen  benefits,
accelerate efforts, and focus resources.

To  its  credit,  FAA  is  working  on  what  can  be  done  in  the  near-term.  As  part  of
these  efforts,  FAA  is  planning  to  use  new  routes  that  rely  on  existing  avionics  on-
board aircraft and various demonstration projects. FAA has also made some organi-
zational  changes,  which  included  establishing  a  new  Senior  Vice  President  for
NextGen Implementation and Operations Planning.

Costs for NextGen remain uncertain, however, and much work remains to set re-
search  agendas  and  priorities  for  a  multi-agency  approach,  establish  requirements
for  software-intensive  acquisitions,  determine  steps  to  deliver  NextGen  capabilities,
and  develop  realistic  transition  plans.  The  development  and  execution  of  NextGen
will  require  sustained  oversight  and  will  therefore  be  a  key  issue  for  the  next  Con-
gress and a top management challenge for the next administration.

My remarks today will focus on four points:

• First, FAA is at a crossroads with modernizing the National Airspace System
(NAS) and faces considerable challenges in keeping existing systems on track,
maintaining  aging  facilities,  and  developing  and  implementing  NextGen  ini-
tiatives.  As  we  reported  in  April,1 approximately  30  existing  projects  form
‘‘platforms’’ for NextGen, and FAA must make more than 20 critical decisions
over the next two years that will have significant budgetary implications. For
example, FAA will have to address what changes are needed to modernize its
terminal  facilities  and  whether  it  will  pursue  a  ‘‘common  automation  plat-
form’’ for terminal and en route environments in the future.
FAA  faces  complex  integration  issues  (e.g.,  linking  legacy  and  new  systems)
as it must manage interdependencies among diverse programs. To reduce risk
and  help  bridge  the  transition  from  today’s  system  to  a  vastly  different
NextGen  environment,  we  recommended  that  FAA  conduct  a  ‘‘gap  analysis’’

lenges  in  Managing  Ongoing  Projects,  Sustaining  Existing  Facilities,  and  Introducing  New  Ca-
pabilities,’’  April  14,  2008.  OIG  reports  and  testimonies  are  available  on  our  website:

of the current and NextGen systems and develop an interim architecture (i.e.,
technical  blueprint)  for  the  2015  timeframe.  FAA  is  taking  steps  to  address
our recommendations.

• Second,  progress  has  been  made  in  coordinating  budgets  and  plans  among
JPDO  partner  agencies.  However,  FAA  and  its  partner  agencies  need  to  ad-
dress significant issues related to resource alignment, research priorities, and
policy questions that will materially affect the cost and schedule for NextGen.
These  issues  focus  on  developing  advanced  NextGen  software  for  boosting
controller  productivity;  reaching  agreement  between  FAA,  the  Department  of
Defense  (DOD),  and  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  on
NextGen  security  and  surveillance  issues;  reconciling  differences  on  new
weather  systems;  and  effectively  linking  human  factors  research  for  control-
lers and pilots to ensure that NextGen capabilities can be safely implemented.
• Third, how FAA is organized to manage and execute NextGen is an important
matter given the high-risk nature of the effort and FAA’s past problems with
developing  new  technologies.  While  FAA’s  decision  to  place  the  JPDO  within
the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) could help in implementing NextGen capa-
bilities,  it  also  appears  to  reduce  the  JPDO  in  stature  and  importance.  It  is
premature  to  judge  the  effectiveness  of  this  change,  but  we  found  that  FAA
needs  to  clarify  roles  and  responsibilities  among  offices  (the  JPDO  and  the
new  NextGen  Office  for  Implementation  and  Integration).  We  also  note  that
budget  authority  for  NextGen  efforts  remains  fragmented  among  FAA  lines
of business.
How  best  to  organize  FAA  is  a  policy  call,  but  we  believe  that  clear  lines  of
accountability and authority will be critical for managing NextGen. FAA will
have to revisit the overall governance of NextGen once it has a better picture
of what it will ultimately take to deliver NextGen capabilities.

• Finally, a number of actions are needed from FAA going forward to help shift
NextGen  efforts  from  research  to  implementation.  To  focus  budgetary  re-
sources  and  set  expectations  for  NextGen,  FAA  must  (1)  establish  priorities
and  include  them  in  budget  and  planning  documents,  (2)  focus  much  needed
attention on technology transfer issues, (3) clearly define the roles of the ATO
and JPDO and effectively use in-house resources, (4) place a high priority on
relieving already congested airports, and (5) examine what can reasonably be
implemented in given time increments.

I would now like to discuss these four areas in further detail.

CHALLENGES  FACING  FAA  IN  MODERNIZING  THE  NATIONAL  AIR-

SPACE SYSTEM

FAA is at a crossroads with its efforts to modernize the National Airspace System.
The Agency will be challenged to keep ongoing projects on track, maintain aging fa-
cilities,  and  develop  and  implement  NextGen  initiatives.  For  FY  2009,  FAA  is  re-
questing  $2.7  billion  for  capital  funding—an  increase  of  eight  percent  over  last
year’s enacted level.

FAA  is  starting  a  new  chapter  in  modernization  with  NextGen,  and  the  Agency’s
capital  account  is  now  being  shaped  by  these  initiatives.  Between  FY  2008  and  FY
2013,  FAA  plans  to  spend  $18  billion  for  capital  efforts,  including  $5.6  billion  spe-
cifically  for  NextGen.  We  note  that  much  of  the  projected  funding  for  NextGen  will
focus on developmental efforts, which are funded through the Engineering, Develop-
ment,  Test,  and  Evaluation  portion  of  the  capital  account.  These  efforts  are  pro-
jected  to  amount  to  $3.4  billion  through  FY  2013—a  significant  portion  of  the
amount dedicated to NextGen spending.

In  FY  2009,  more  than  $630  million  will  be  dedicated  to  NextGen-related  pro-
grams,  which  include  Automatic  Dependent  Surveillance–Broadcast  (ADS–B)  and
System-Wide  Information  Management  (SWIM).  Of  this  amount,  $203  million  is
dedicated  to  eight  new  developmental  initiatives,  including  NextGen  system  devel-
opment, trajectory-based operations, and flexible terminals and airports. The figure
below illustrates FAA’s planned investments in ongoing projects and NextGen initia-
tives from FY 2008 to FY 2013.

49

In addition to capital spending, FAA also plans to spend $374 million in research,
engineering,  and  development  funds  through  FY  2013  for  NextGen.  These  include
air-ground integration, wake turbulence, and environmental research.

Progress and Problems With FAA Acquisitions

In  our  April  2008  report,  we  examined  progress  and  problems  with  18  major  ac-
quisitions  valued  at  $17.5  billion.  Overall,  we  are  not  seeing  the  significant  cost
growth  and  schedule  slips  with  FAA  major  acquisitions  that  occurred  in  the  past.
This is because FAA has taken a more incremental approach to managing major ac-
quisitions.  When  comparing  revised  baselines,  only  two  of  the  eighteen  projects  we
reviewed  have  experienced  additional  cost  growth  ($53  million)  and  delays  (five
years)  since  our  last  report  in  2005.2 However,  from  program  inception,  six  pro-
grams  have  experienced  cost  growth  of  nearly  $4.7  billion  and  schedule  delays  of
one to twelve years.

While  FAA’s  incremental  approach  may  reduce  risk  in  the  near-term,  it  has  left
several programs with no clear end-state and less visibility into how much they will
ultimately  cost.  A  case  in  point  involves  modernizing  facilities  that  manage  traffic
in  the  vicinity  of  airports,  which  is  commonly  referred  to  as  ‘‘terminal  moderniza-
tion.’’

In 2004, faced with cost growth of over $2 billion for the Standard Terminal Auto-
mation  Replacement  (STARS)  program,  FAA  rethought  its  terminal  modernization
approach and shifted to a phased process, committing STARS to just 50 sites at an
estimated cost of $1.46 billion. FAA’s original plan was to deploy the system to 172
sites for $940 million. FAA renamed this modernization effort the Terminal Automa-
tion Modernization-Replacement (TAMR) initiative.

In  2005,  FAA  approved  modernizing  displays  through  the  TAMR  program  (re-
ferred  to  as  TAMR  Phase  2)  by  replacing  legacy  equipment  at  five  additional  small
sites and replacing the aging displays at four large, complex facilities. However, this
leaves over 100 sites still in need of modernization. FAA has not decided how it will
modernize these sites, and costs remain uncertain. For FY 2009, FAA is requesting
$31.2 million for terminal modernization efforts.

There is no defined end-state for terminal modernization, and past problems with
developing  and  deploying  STARS  leave  FAA  in  a  difficult  position  to  begin  intro-
ducing NextGen capabilities. Future terminal modernization costs will be shaped by
(1)  NextGen  requirements,  (2)  the  extent  of  FAA’s  terminal  facilities  consolidation,
and  (3)  the  need  to  replace  or  sustain  existing  (legacy)  systems  that  have  not  been
modernized.

Challenges With Key NextGen Programs

50

FAA  has  established  initial  cost  and  schedule  baselines  for  the  first  segments  of
two  key  NextGen  initiatives:  ADS–B  and  SWIM.  Both  programs  face  considerable
risks and require significant oversight as FAA begins integrating them with existing
systems.
ADS–B:  This  program  provides  satellite-based  technology  that  allows  aircraft  to
broadcast their position to other aircraft and ground systems. For FY 2009, FAA is
requesting  $300  million  for  ADS–B.  In  August  2007,  FAA  awarded  a  service-based
contract  for  the  ADS–B  ground  infrastructure  worth  $1.8  billion  (if  all  options  are
exercised).  FAA  estimates  that  ADS–B  will  cost  about  $1.6  billion  in  capital  costs
for  initial  implementation  segments  through  2014.  These  include  completing  a  na-
tionwide ground system for receiving and broadcasting ADS–B signals.

A  key  challenge  facing  FAA—and  NextGen  implementation—is  realizing  the  full
benefits of ADS–B. FAA plans to implement ‘‘ADS–B—Out’’ in the 2020 timeframe,
which  will  require  aircraft  to  broadcast  their  position  to  ground  systems.  However,
most  capacity  and  safety  benefits  from  the  new  system  will  come  from  ‘‘ADS–B—
In,’’  which  will  display  information  in  the  cockpit  for  pilots.  The  requirements  for
ADS–B—In are still evolving and have not been finalized.

FAA  must  address  several  risks  to  realize  the  benefits  of  ADS–B.  These  include:
(1)  gaining  stakeholder  acceptance  and  aircraft  equipage,  (2)  addressing  broadcast
frequency  congestion  concerns,  (3)  integrating  with  existing  systems,  (4)  imple-
menting  procedures  for  separating  aircraft,  and  (5)  assessing  potential  security
vulnerabilities in managing air traffic.

ADS–B  implementation  is  a  long-term  effort  that  will  require  significant  invest-
ment  from  the  government  and  industry.  Given  FAA’s  history  with  developing  new
technologies and its approach to ADS–B, in which the government will not own the
ground  infrastructure,  we  believe  this  program  will  require  a  significant  level  of
oversight. We will report on ADS–B later this year.
SWIM: This program provides FAA with a web-based architecture that allows infor-
mation  sharing  among  airspace  users.  For  FY  2009,  FAA  is  requesting  $41  million
for  SWIM.  In  June  2007,  FAA  baselined  the  first  two  years  of  segment  1  (planned
to  occur  between  FY  2009  and  2010)  for  $104  million.  FAA’s  latest  Capital  Invest-
ment Plan cost estimate for SWIM is $285 million.

Current  challenges  include  the  work  to  determine  requirements  and  interfaces
with  other  FAA  systems,  including  the  En  Route  Automation  Modernization
(ERAM)  and  Air  Traffic  Management  programs.  Moreover,  FAA  must  integrate
SWIM  with  other  federal  agencies’  operations  to  realize  NextGen  benefits  and  de-
velop  a  robust  cyber  security  strategy  and  design.  While  FAA  has  begun  initial  ef-
forts,  it  still  needs  to  establish  the  architecture,  strategy,  and  design.  Additional
SWIM  segments  have  yet  to  be  determined,  and  the  cost  to  fully  implement  SWIM
is  unknown.  Last  month,  we  began  a  review  of  SWIM,  which  will  focus  on  the
strengths and weaknesses of FAA’s approach for developing the new system and as-
sess risks that could affect nationwide deployment.

Much Work Remains To Determine How To Transition Existing Projects to NextGen
In February 2007, we recommended that FAA examine existing projects to deter-
mine if they were still needed and, if so, what adjustments would be required. FAA
concurred  with  our  recommendation  and  stated  that  it  has  begun  this  assessment.
To  date,  however,  FAA  has  not  made  major  adjustments  to  modernization  projects
to accelerate NextGen.

According to FAA, approximately 30 existing capital programs will serve as ‘‘plat-
forms’’  for  NextGen.  For  example,  the  $2.1  billion  ERAM  program,  which  provides
new  hardware  and  software  for  facilities  that  manage  high-altitude  traffic,  is  a
lynchpin for the NextGen system. Because ERAM is expected to serve as a founda-
tion for NextGen, any program cost increases or schedule delays will affect the pace
of  introducing  new  capabilities.  Currently,  ERAM  software  requirements  related  to
NextGen  are  still  uncertain,  but  costs  are  expected  to  be  in  the  billions  of  dollars.
Over  the  next  two  years,  FAA  must  make  more  than  25  critical  decisions  about
ongoing programs. These decisions have significant budget implications and will af-
fect  all  major  lines  of  the  modernization  effort  with  respect  to  automation,  commu-
nications, navigation, and surveillance. For example, FAA will have to address what
changes  are  needed  to  modernize  its  terminal  facilities  and  whether  it  will  pursue
a ‘‘common automation platform’’ for terminal and en route environments in the fu-
ture.

Sound investment decisions for NextGen can only be accomplished through a com-
prehensive  enterprise  architecture  (i.e.,  technical  blueprint)  that  outlines  how  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:09 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 044270 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\091108\44270 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

51

system  will  work  and  what  changes  to  existing  programs  will  be  required.  The  en-
terprise architecture must establish a transition plan for existing NAS systems that
identifies  how  each  system  currently  functions  and  it  will  transition  to  NextGen.  A
central element will be outlining a path to develop both existing and proposed auto-
mation systems.

FAA  has  made  progress  in  developing  the  NextGen  Enterprise  Architecture,
which  is  planned  to  be  implemented  by  2025.3 FAA  has  also  progressed  towards
technical  roadmaps  for  the  automation,  communications,  navigation,  and  surveil-
lance  lines  of  effort.  However,  planning  documents  we  reviewed,  including  the
NextGen Enterprise Architecture, lack detail with respect to requirements, particu-
larly for automation, that could be used to develop reliable cost estimates and sched-
ule. As we noted in our April report, in most cases, information in the NextGen En-
terprise Architecture remained at too high a level to be effective.

To help bridge the transition from the current NAS to NextGen, we recommended

several actions to FAA in April, including the following:

• Conduct  a  gap  analysis  of  the  current  NAS  and  NextGen.  FAA’s
NextGen  architecture  does  not  yet  fully  detail  how  FAA  will  transition  from
the  present  NAS  and  the  future  NextGen  architectures,  which  are  consider-
ably  different.  Understanding  this  gap  is  important  because  one  industry
analysis we have seen suggests that FAA could face a $50 billion software de-
velopment  effort  with  NextGen.  Until  FAA  completes  a  gap  analysis,  it  will
not  be  possible  to  determine  technical  requirements  that  translate  into  reli-
able  cost  and  schedule  estimates  for  major  acquisitions.  The  ATO  has  begun
an  analysis  of  existing  modernization  efforts  and  expects  to  complete  it  by
February 2009.

• Develop  an  interim  architecture  for  what  can  be  accomplished  by
2015.  Because  of  the  significant  differences  between  the  current  system  and
the  NextGen  architecture  and  concept  of  operations,  FAA  should  develop  an
interim  architecture  or  ‘‘way-point’’  for  the  2015  timeframe  that  is  consistent
with  current  NextGen  plans.  This  would  help  to  bridge  the  gap  between  cur-
rent  systems  and  plans  for  the  future.  It  would  also  help  FAA  to  determine
reasonable  goals,  establish  priorities,  fully  identify  adjustments  to  existing
projects,  refine  requirements  for  new  systems,  and  understand  complex  tran-
sition  issues.  FAA  has  a  mid-term  requirements  team  that  is  due  to  report
on its activities next summer.

FAA  Needs  To  Address  Significant  Issues  in  Coordinating  and  Aligning

JPDO Partner Agencies’ Budgets and Plans

The  JPDO  was  mandated  by  law  to  coordinate  research  among  diverse  federal
agencies  to  develop  NextGen  in  the  2025  timeframe.  This  is  an  important  mission
given that FAA conducts very little long-term air traffic management research. Cen-
tral to making the JPDO an effective multi-agency vehicle is alignment of resources.
This  is  a  complex  task,  and  the  JPDO  has  no  authority  to  adjust  or  redirect  the
research budgets of other federal agencies.

We have seen some progress with the various ‘‘mechanisms of alignment,’’ includ-
ing  the  NextGen  Concept  of  Operations,  the  NextGen  Enterprise  Architecture,  and
the  Integrated  Work  Plan4 since  our  February  2007  report.5 In  addition,  the  JPDO
now  has  a  signed  Memorandum  of  Agreement  with  all  partner  agencies  and  has
published  a  NextGen  research  and  development  plan.  An  exhibit  to  our  statement
details the various mechanisms of alignment we reviewed.

However,  the  NextGen  Enterprise  Architecture  and  Integrated  Work  Plan  con-
tinue  to  evolve  and  remain  at  a  very  high  level.  These  documents  are  not  yet  ma-
ture  enough  to  drive  investment  decisions  or  generate  requirements  for  major
NextGen  acquisitions,  particularly  for  new  software-intensive  systems.  As  noted  by
the  National  Research  Council,6 these  efforts  still  reflect  a  lack  of  top-level  system
engineering and clearly established priorities. JPDO officials told us that it will take

ment.

capabilities needed to transition to NextGen from the current system and provide the research,
policy, regulation, and acquisition timelines necessary to achieve NextGen by 2025.

a  year  or  more  for  the  documents  to  be  effective  tools  for  driving  agency  budgets,
setting priorities, and managing research efforts.

FAA and its partner agencies need to address several fundamental issues related
to policy questions and research priorities to ensure that research and development
efforts  are  aligned  and  successfully  transferred  to  the  NAS.  An  internal  JPDO  as-
sessment identified 27 single agency and cross-agency disconnects or gaps that will
materially affect the cost and timeframes for developing NextGen. These include the
following areas.
Development of Advanced Software and Flexible Airspace: The National Aer-
onautics and Space Administration (NASA) is taking the lead role in developing new
software  algorithms  that  will  help  boost  controller  productivity  and  provide  more
flexible airspace; these are key elements and cost drivers for NextGen. As we noted
in  our  February  2007  report,  NASA  is  spending  less  on  aeronautics  research  than
in the past and is concentrating on ‘‘fundamental research’’ instead of prototype de-
velopment. This is in sharp contrast to NASA’s support of FAA’s Free Flight Phase
1  initiative,  which  introduced  new  automated  controller  tools  at  select  locations  in
the  1998  to  2002  timeframe.  FAA’s  Research  Engineering  Development  Advisory
Committee7 suggested  that  $100  million  would  be  needed  by  FAA  annually  to  ac-
commodate changes in NASA investments and address this gap.

To address this concern, we recommended that FAA assess the maturity of NASA
research  and  develop  a  contingency  plan  for  how  to  conduct,  manage,  and  pay  for
this research and development. FAA concurred and has established ‘‘research transi-
tion teams’’ to determine how best to advance NASA research.

The  JPDO’s  internal  assessment  showed  that  NASA  research  is  fairly  well-
aligned.  However,  NASA  research  efforts  fall  short  with  respect  to  integrating
weather  information  into  new  systems,  validating  new  software  algorithms,  linking
airport arrivals and departures, and creating flexible airspace in the vicinity of air-
ports.  Further,  fundamental  questions  about  how  requirements  should  be  allocated
to ground automation systems and the cockpit remain unresolved.

NASA  officials  told  us  that  they  will  consider  advancing  some  NextGen  research
to  a  higher  technology  level  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  Notwithstanding  these  efforts,
the transition from NASA research to prototype development and ultimately imple-
mentation  remains  a  key  watch  item  and  cost  driver.  We  are  assisting  the  NASA
Office of Inspector General in examining NASA’s contribution to NextGen, including
the  management  of  research  projects  and  contracting  vehicles.  The  NASA  Office  of
Inspector General expects to complete its report later this year.
Surveillance  and  Airspace  Security:  FAA  is  developing  new  systems,  such  as
ADS–B,  that  will  decrease  reliance  on  ground-based  radar  and  instead  rely  on  on-
board systems to broadcast aircraft positions. While the new systems will be useful
to  DOD  and  DHS,  they  will  not  meet  all  of  their  needs  with  respect  to  identifying
and  monitoring  unlawful  flights.  DOD  is  funding  research  and  development  for  fu-
ture  radar  and  surveillance  sensors.  The  JPDO  assessment  cautioned  that  surveil-
lance and security efforts are not as synchronized as they should be and stated that
the  best  methods  for  meeting  the  needs  and  requirements  of  various  agencies  have
yet to be determined. Without networking and integration among different agencies,
there  is  potential  for  duplicative  efforts,  gaps  in  airspace  coverage,  and  inefficiency
that  could  impede  the  integrated  surveillance  and  security  capabilities  envisioned
for NextGen.
Net-Centric  Operations  and  Sharing  Information:  A  key  element  of  NextGen
is  sharing  a  wide  range  of  information  (weather  information,  flight  data,  and  air-
craft position) securely and seamlessly. The JPDO is seeking to leverage DOD’s ex-
tensive  experience  in  this  area,  and  demonstrations  have  shown  the  potential  for
linking various agency systems—both old and new—for sharing data. However, sev-
eral  factors  are  impeding  progress.  As  the  JPDO’s  internal  assessment  points  out,
plans,  standards,  and  execution  paths  for  FAA,  DOD,  DHS,  and  the  Department  of
Commerce  to  connect  various  networks  do  not  yet  exist.  Further,  no  cross-agency
plan  exists  for  integrating  agencies’  net-centric  efforts  to  ensure  seamless  oper-
ations.

7 The  Research,  Engineering  and  Development  Advisory  Committee  was  established  in  1989
and  advises  the  Administrator  on  research  and  development  issues  and  coordinates  the  FAA’s
research, engineering, and development activities with industry and other Government agencies.
The  committee  considers  aviation  research  needs  in  air  traffic  services,  airport  technology,  air-
craft safety, aviation security, human factors, and environment and energy.

Development  of  New  Weather  Tools  and  Concepts:  The  Department  of  Com-
merce  has  the  lead  role  in  developing  the  ‘‘4–D  Weather  Cube,’’ 8 which  is  expected
to provide a single authoritative source for weather observations and analysis. This
tool  is  also  expected  to  provide  a  common  picture  of  weather  for  all  airspace  users.
The JPDO’s assessment found that there is disagreement on synchronizing weath-
er  observations,  forecasts,  and  dissemination  efforts.  This  threatens  current  plans
to  implement  the  4–D  Weather  Cube  in  the  2013  timeframe.  The  assessment  also
noted that several policy and funding issues need to be addressed; specifically, most
of the Department of Commerce efforts that JPDO expects to rely on are not funded.
In addition, there is disagreement on the legal responsibilities for providing weather
information and requirements for new weather systems.
Human Factors for Controllers and Pilots: As  we  have  noted  in  the  past,  a  fo-
cused human factors research effort for NextGen is needed to ensure that new con-
cepts  and  technologies  can  be  safely  implemented.  This  is  important  because  the
NextGen concept of operations calls for significant changes to the roles of controllers
and  pilots.  We  note  that  insufficient  attention  to  human  factors  with  STARS  re-
sulted  in  significant  cost  increases  and  schedule  slips.  Key  issues  for  NextGen
human factors research focus on what can reasonably be expected from new automa-
tion systems and cockpit displays.

This  remains  a  major  risk  area  for  NextGen.  The  JPDO  assessment  noted  a  lack
of  linkage  between  planned  human  factors  research  and  key  issues  that  needs  to
be  resolved.  This  includes  the  impact  of  highly  automated  systems  on  controllers.
We are concerned because there is no cross-cutting, interagency plan for identifying
and  addressing  NextGen  human  factors  issues  that  (1)  establishes  an  agreed-upon
set  of  initial  focus  areas  for  research,  (2)  inventories  existing  facilities  for  research,
and (3) capitalizes on past and current research.

Observations on FAA’s Recent Reorganization of NextGen Efforts

The question of whether or not FAA is properly organized to implement NextGen
is  important  because  it  will  drive  the  success  of  the  effort.  As  we  have  previously
noted, the development of NextGen cuts across all lines of the ATO. It also involves
FAA’s airport and certification offices. Further, NextGen efforts will need to be man-
aged  as  integrated  ‘‘portfolios’’  to  achieve  expected  benefits.  We  believe  that  clear
lines of accountability and budget authority will be essential for managing NextGen.
The overall governance of the NextGen effort has been the subject of debate, and
stakeholders have raised concerns that FAA is not properly organized to manage or
execute a multi-billion-dollar effort. Furthermore, there has been—and continues to
be—friction  between  the  ATO  and  JPDO,  which  is  due  in  part  to  vastly  different
planning  horizons.  The  ATO  is  an  organization  that  operates  constantly  but  has  a
short planning horizon. The JPDO, on the other hand, is focused on introducing cut-
ting-edge technologies and transforming the NAS by the 2025 timeframe. It will be
important to reconcile these differences to successfully implement NextGen.

In  May  2008,  FAA  announced  a  reorganization  of  its  NextGen  efforts,  which  in-
cluded  establishing  a  Senior  Vice  President  for  NextGen  and  Operations  Planning
within  the  ATO;  this  individual  reports  to  the  FAA  Chief  Operating  Officer.  FAA
is also establishing an office for NextGen Implementation and Integration to support
the Senior Vice President.

• First,  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  JPDO  and  the  ATO  office  for
NextGen  Implementation  and  Integration  are  not  clearly  defined.  According
to FAA, the JPDO will focus on long-term planning and interagency coopera-
tion while the ATO will focus on more short-term efforts and other implemen-
tation issues. However, it will be difficult to establish clear demarcation lines
because implementing NextGen capabilities depends heavily on modifying ex-
isting modernization projects. Both offices will have budget functions, consid-
erable  modeling  and  simulation  capabilities,  and  architecture  staffs.  Because

Under  this  framework,  the  JPDO  now  reports  to  the  Senior  Vice  President  for
NextGen  and  Operations  Planning.  In  the  past,  the  JPDO  reported  directly  to  the
FAA Administrator and the Chief Operating Officer. While FAA believes the change
will help move NextGen concepts closer to implementation, it could also give the ap-
pearance that the JPDO has been reduced in stature and importance.

This recent reorganization is still undergoing changes, and it is too early to deter-

mine its effectiveness; however, we do have the following initial observations:

8 The 4–D Weather Cube is expected to be a distributed database on weather observations for
the  continental  United  States.  It  is  expected  to  include  observations  with  respect  to  latitude,
longitude, altitude, and time.

both offices will help to shape research and development plans, it will be im-
portant to establish clearly defined roles and responsibilities.

• Second,  while  the  ATO’s  Senior  Vice  President  for  NextGen  and  Operations
Planning will manage demonstration projects, other ATO Vice Presidents will
manage major modernization projects considered to be essential platforms for
NextGen.  For  example,  the  Vice  President  for  En  Route  Services  manages
multi-billion-dollar  efforts  like  ERAM  and  ADS–B.  SWIM,  however,  will  be
managed  by  the  Vice  President  for  Technical  Operations.  Similarly,  the  Vice
President  for  Terminal  Services  manages  efforts  to  modernize  controller  dis-
plays  and  computer  equipment  located  in  the  vicinity  of  airports.  However,
airports—which play a key role in NextGen—are managed by a different FAA
office that is outside the ATO. Thus, budgetary authority for FAA moderniza-
tion efforts remains fragmented across various offices.
The  Senior  Vice  President  for  NextGen  and  Operations  Planning  stated  that
she will be responsible for the integration and implementation of all NextGen
elements even though most elements will be managed and executed by other
ATO  service  units  and  lines  of  business.  The  NextGen  and  Operations  Plan-
ning  Office  will  rely  on  coordination  and  a  commitment  monitoring  process
across  multiple  areas.  This  approach,  however,  has  not  been  fully  imple-
mented  or  tested  for  linking  budgets  and  plans  for  diverse  programs.  Given
the complex nature of NextGen development, FAA’s approach to determining
budget  authority  and  managing  interdependencies  among  legacy  and  new
programs will be important watch items for this committee.

• Third,  the  new  structure  will  be  challenged  to  deal  with  complex,  cross-cut-
ting government issues. In our opinion, it will be difficult for an office within
the  ATO  to  work  out  agreements  with  DOD  and  DHS  on  major  decisions  af-
fecting surveillance and airspace security.

It remains to be seen how DOD, NASA, Commerce, and other JPDO partner agen-
cies will view the reorganization and how it will affect participation in NextGen ef-
forts.  FAA  must  clearly  demonstrate  that  this  change  is  neither  a  demotion  for  the
JPDO  nor  a  decrease  in  the  Agency’s  commitment  to  a  multi-agency  approach  for
developing NextGen.

FAA  will  likely  have  to  revisit  the  question  of  NextGen  governance  once  it  has
a better picture of what will be required to develop and implement NextGen. As we
have  noted  in  the  past,  FAA  will  have  to  address  other  NextGen  management
issues,  such  as  deciding  whether  a  ‘‘lead  systems  integrator’’  will  be  needed  to  ad-
dress the complex system engineering challenges in linking legacy and new systems.
We note that the House Reauthorization proposal (H.R. 2881) would establish an
Associate Administrator for NextGen who would report directly to the FAA Adminis-
trator.  How  to  organize  FAA  is  a  policy  call  for  Congress,  but  we  believe  such  an
approach  has  merit  as  the  cross-cutting  nature  of  the  NextGen  effort  will  require
close  coordination  of  multi-billion-dollar  investments  from  industry  and  other  fed-
eral agencies.

Several Actions Are Needed Going Forward To Help Focus NextGen Efforts
Moving  forward  with  NextGen  will  be  a  central  issue  for  the  next  Congress  and
a  top  management  challenge  for  the  new  administration.  FAA  is  at  a  critical  junc-
ture with its NextGen efforts and needs to set expectations and budgetary priorities.
This chapter in air traffic modernization is different from previous efforts because
NextGen concepts rely heavily on airspace users to invest billions of dollars in new
avionics. The current state of the airline industry requires FAA to determine where
investments in new technology can have the most benefit in reducing costs and alle-
viating delays, the underlying causes of consumer dissatisfaction with air travel.

We  have  made  numerous  recommendations  to  FAA  and  the  JPDO  to  help  them
move  forward  with  NextGen.  These  include  developing  an  interim  architecture,  as-
sessing the skill mix with respect to necessary systems integration and contracting,
and focusing human factors research to ensure concepts can be safely implemented.
FAA  agreed  with  all  of  our  recommendations  and  has  begun  addressing  our  con-
cerns. At this time, we believe FAA needs to take the following actions.

• Establish priorities and reflect them in budget requests and plans. It
remains difficult for decision-makers to determine what to invest in first from
the wide range of operational improvements in NextGen planning documents.
FAA  has  taken  some  steps  to  begin  shaping  priorities,  such  as  integrating
weather  data  into  new  systems.  Nevertheless,  more  work  is  required  to  set
priorities  and  identify  the  proper  sequencing  of  efforts.  FAA  should  provide

this  committee  with  a  clear  understanding  of  how  it  will  prioritize  research
and development, how it is addressing various research gaps, and how it will
update  priorities  when  research  results  become  available  or  when  national
priorities change.

• Develop a strategy for transferring technology. As we noted in our Feb-
ruary  2007  report,  the  movement  of  technology  from  one  organization  to  an-
other is critical given the JPDO’s mandate. However, the JPDO’s internal as-
sessment  noted  that  mechanisms  and  funding  to  transition  research  into  the
NAS  may  be  inadequate.  To  address  technology  transfer  issues  with  NASA,
FAA  has  established  ‘‘research  transition  teams.’’  FAA  has  not,  however,
formed  similar  teams  for  other  agencies,  such  as  the  Departments  of  Com-
merce  and  Defense.  JPDO  officials  pointed  out  that  ‘‘entrance  and  exit’’  cri-
teria  with  clearly  defined  hand-off  points  for  research  projects  would  aid  in
determining what it will take to transition new concepts and technologies into
daily operations.

• Clearly define the roles of the ATO and JPDO and focus the consider-
able  resources  at  the  Agency’s  disposal.  Agency  resources  that  are  key
to  NextGen  development  include  the  MITRE  Corporation  (FAA’s  federally
funded Research and Development Center), the NextGen Institute9 (a mecha-
nism  for  the  private  sector  to  cooperate  with  the  JPDO  on  NextGen),  and
RTCA  (an  industry/Government  forum  that  functions  as  Federal  Advisory
Committee  for  FAA).  Because  there  is  considerable  potential  for  duplicative
efforts, FAA officials agree that it is an appropriate time to re-examine work
plans, assess resources, and review roles of these various organizations.
All  of  these  organizations  can  help  validate  NextGen  concepts  and  establish
requirements. Understanding the impact of many changes will require exten-
sive analysis, modeling, simulation, and work with airspace users to examine
trade-offs  and  assess  benefits.  Clearly  defined  roles  for  each  of  these  organi-
zations  would  help  better  define  investment  decisions  and  foster  consensus
among stakeholders.

• Focus attention on airport issues and the relief that various NextGen
technologies can provide to already congested airports in major met-
ropolitan areas, like New York and Chicago. Reducing congestion at air-
ports  should  be  a  top  priority  for  FAA.  An  important  metric  for  NextGen  is
to  what  extent  FAA  can  improve  airport  arrival  rates  under  various  weather
conditions. FAA recognizes the importance of this and is shifting resources to
this  issue.  However,  FAA’s  efforts  to  examine  ‘‘high  density  operations’’  are
in  the  very  early  stages,  and  planning  documents  and  budget  requests  thus
far  do  not  detail  how  individual  NextGen  systems  can  specifically  boost  air-
port  capacity  and  reduce  delays.  Decision-makers  and  stakeholders  need  to
know what elements—ADS–B, new routes, and data link communications for
controllers  and  pilots—are  essential  for  improving  capacity  at  already  con-
gested airports.

• Develop  a  realistic  plan  for  implementing  ADS–B  and  realizing  the
air-to-air benefits of the new technology. This is important because FAA
has  a  contract  in  place  and  has  published  a  Notice  of  Proposed  Rule-making
(NPRM).  The  NPRM  calls  for  users  to  equip  with  ADS–B—Out  in  the  2020
timeframe. FAA has received comments from 177 organizations or individuals
about the details of the NPRM. While most agree that ADS–B is an important
part of the future, some raised concerns about requirements, the cost of equi-
page, and lack of clear benefits—all legitimate issues that will need to be re-
solved.  FAA  will  likely  have  to  make  significant  changes  to  its  plans  for  im-
plementing ADS–B in the United States.

• Assess  ‘‘implementation  bandwidth’’  and  develop  transition  bench-
marks.  FAA’s  ability  to  implement  multiple  capabilities  in  a  given  time  pe-
riod needs to be assessed. There are limits to what can be accomplished given
the  scope  of  change  envisioned  and  efforts  currently  underway.  For  example,
FAA  has  staggered  key  NextGen  capabilities,  such  as  data  link  communica-
tions,  to  wait  for  the  completion  of  ERAM  in  the  2012  timeframe.  FAA  must
clearly  identify  how  various  efforts  will  be  sequenced.  Further,  FAA  and  in-

9 The  NextGen  Institute  was  established  in  March  2005  by  joint  agreement  between  the  Na-
tional  Center  for  Advanced  Technologies  (NCAT)  and  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  ‘‘as
the mechanism through which the JPDO will access private sector expertise, tools, and facilities
for application to NextGen activities and tasks.’’

dustry  need  realistic  transition  benchmarks  that  point  to  when  new  training
(for controllers and pilots), equipment (new avionics and ground systems), and
procedures need to be in place at specific locations.

Mr.  Chairman,  this  concludes  my  statement.  I  would  be  happy  to  answer  any

questions that you or other Members of the Committee might have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR CALVIN L. SCOVEL III

Calvin L. Scovel III is the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Transpor-

tation (DOT).

Mr.  Scovel  was  nominated  by  President  Bush  on  July  13,  2006,  confirmed  by  the

Senate on September 29, 2006, and sworn in on October 27, 2006.

Scovel joined DOT after 29 years of active service in the U.S. Marine Corps, from
which he retired as a Brigadier General. His last military assignment was as a sen-
ior judge on the U.S. Navy–Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals. He previously
served  as  Assistant  Judge  Advocate  General  of  the  Navy  for  Military  Justice,  the
principal  advisor  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Navy  and  the  Judge  Advocate  General  on

all criminal justice policy matters. Mr. Scovel also commanded a military police bat-
talion  that  provided  all  security  and  law  enforcement  services  for  Marine  Corps
Base, Quantico, Virginia.

Mr.  Scovel  served  as  senior  legal  advisor  for  the  4th  Marine  Expeditionary  Bri-
gade,  which  included  all  Marine  amphibious  forces  in  Operation  Desert  Storm,  and
later  in  a  NATO  exercise  in  Norway.  He  had  previously  served  as  legal  advisor  for
a  Marine  amphibious  unit  deployed  to  the  Western  Pacific  and  Indian  Oceans,
where it conducted exercises in Japan, the Philippines, Kenya, and Australia.

He was prosecutor or defense counsel in 250 courts-martial that included charges

of murder, rape, child sexual assault, and drug trafficking.

As  an  adjunct  faculty  member  for  the  Defense  Institute  of  International  Legal
Studies,  Mr.  Scovel  led  instruction  teams  in  the  rule  of  law  and  civilian  control  of
the  military  for  senior  civilian  and  military  officials  in  Honduras,  Mauritius,  Alba-
nia,  and  Serbia.  Mr.  Scovel,  who  was  in  the  Pentagon  on  September  11,  2001,  has
received  military  awards  including  the  Legion  of  Merit  (four  awards)  and  the  Com-
bat Action Ribbon.

Mr.  Scovel  received  his  Bachelor’s  degree  from  the  University  of  North  Carolina
at  Chapel  Hill  and  his  Juris  Doctor  degree  from  Duke  University.  He  also  received
a Master’s degree from the Naval War College.

Mr.  Scovel  and  his  wife,  Cathy,  have  two  sons:  Carey,  a  2006  graduate  of  Elon
University who is a police officer in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Thomas, a mid-
shipman at the U.S. Naval Academy.

Mr.  Scovel  is  the  sixth  person  to  serve  as  DOT  Inspector  General.  The  Office  of
Inspector  General  (OIG)  was  established  by  law  in  1978  to  provide  the  Secretary
and Congress with objective and independent reviews of the efficiency and effective-
ness of DOT operations and activities.

The  OIG  carries  out  its  mission  by  issuing  audit  reports,  evaluations,  and  man-
agement advisories with findings and recommendations to improve program delivery
and performance. In Fiscal Year 2007, OIG issued 81 audit reports, which identified
more than $900 million in financial recommendations.

By  statute,  the  Inspector  General  also  conducts  investigations  into  whether  fed-
eral  laws  and  regulations  were  followed  and  must  report  suspected  civil  and  crimi-
nal  violations  to  the  Attorney  General.  In  Fiscal  Year  2007,  OIG  investigations  re-
sulted in 112 indictments, 142 convictions and $183 million in fines, restitutions and
recoveries.

Chairman GORDON. Thank you. Dr. Kaminski, you are next.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  PAUL  G.  KAMINSKI,  CHAIRMAN  AND  CEO,
TECHNOVATION, INC.; AIA MEMBER OF NEXTGEN INSTITUTE
MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
Dr.  KAMINSKI.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  My  name  is  Paul
Kaminski.  I  am  the  Chairman  and  CEO  of  Technovation  Incor-
porated, but I am here today representing the Aerospace Industries
Association.

Since  January  of  this  year  I  have  been  representing  AIA  on
something  called  the  Institute  Management  Council,  which  works
with the Next Generation Institute that oversees the industry par-
ticipation  in  the  JPDO.  Prior  to  that  I  had  served  on  a  Senior  Re-
view Committee for the JPDO, having been appointed by then Sec-
retary Mineta.

I  last  testified  before  this  committee  in  June  of  2006,  when  I
chaired the National Research Council’s first decadal survey of civil
aeronautics  technology.  In  that  testimony  I  said  that  the  U.S.  Air
Transportation System is a key contributor to the economic vitality,
public  well-being,  and  national  security  of  the  United  States.  I
strongly endorsed the need to improve our Air Transportation Sys-
tem  then,  and  I  believe  that  need  is  even  more  important  today
considering  issues  such  as  the  high  cost  of  fuel  and  our  growing
concerns about the environment.

NextGen,  with  its  capacity,  efficiency,  energy,  environmental,
and  safety  benefits,  must  be  a  strong  and  urgent  priority  for  this

nation.  Marion  Blakey,  former  FAA  Administrator  and  now  Presi-
dent of the Aerospace Industries Association, sought my assistance
in the IMC in January of this year because she knew of my strong
commitment  to  improving  and  actually  executing  on  NextGen,  and
she  also  was  aware  of  the  experience  I  had  serving  as  Under  Sec-
retary  of  Defense  dealing  with  the  development  and  acquisition  of
very large and complex systems such as NextGen.

Working with AIA I have developed a proposal to deal with many
of the issues that have been raised in previous statements and ac-
celerate  the  development,  acquisition,  and  integration  of  the
NextGen  System.  This  approach  is  based  on  the  techniques  that
are  used  to  accelerate  the  development  and  fielding  of  our  first
stealth system, the F–117 in the Department of Defense.

I  found  this  method  to  be  very  effective  in  dealing  with  large,
complex  systems  that  depend  upon  the  effective  integration  of  nu-
merous  enabling  technologies  and  complex  procedures.  I  am  pre-
pared  to  address  this  in  some  more  detail  in  a  briefing  which  fol-
lows if there is interest or in pursuing that further because it deals
with many of the questions that you posed to me.

But before getting into that detail, I would like to highlight a few
other  points  briefly.  One,  system  engineering  and  integration  is
going  to  be  critical  to  the  success  of  NextGen,  and  that  is  the
lynchpin  of  the  proposal  that  I  have  developed.  I  expect  our  na-
tion’s  efforts  on  NextGen  to  continue  for  a  long  time  as  new  tech-
nology  enablers  will  continue  to  appear,  and  we  must  continue  to
consider the costs and benefits of continuing advancing technology.
We  must  also  consider  the  cost  and  benefits  of  maintaining  leg-
acy  systems  that  will  become  obsolete  over  time.  In  a  sense,
NextGen  will  be  like  painting  the  Golden  Gate  Bridge.  When  we
finish  the  north  end,  it  will  be  time  to  come  back  around  to  the
south end and begin again. So we should prepare a foundation with
this extended process in mind. We are going to be at this on a con-
tinuing basis.

But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t move with dispatch to begin
to  implement  this  capability.  The  AIA  proposal  that  I  have  made
allows  us  to  begin  now  to  do  what  I  describe  as  build  a  little  and
test a little, layering and linking capabilities. It will help us to bet-
ter  define  and  prioritize  the  essential  NextGen  R&D  for  both  the
FAA  and  for  our  JPDO  partner  agencies.  It  will  also  provide  criti-
cally-important domain experience to key personnel in government
and  industry.  We  need  this  personal  experience  base  to  be  able  to
execute this kind of a system.

This domain experience in government industry is a requisite for
the system engineering and integration required in such large-scale
and  complex  programs.  I  recently  chaired  another  national  re-
search  council  review,  this  one  on  the  subject  of  system  engineer-
ing,  which  clearly  recognized  the  importance  of  strengthening  sys-
tem  engineering  skills  to  avoid  the  problems  associated  with  the
acquisition  of  large  and  complex  systems  that  we  have  seen  in
DOD and other agencies.

The good news here is that the FAA in an effort led by Vicki Cox
has initiated a program to begin to enhance our system engineering
education, a good first step, more yet is required.

The  third  point,  AIA  believes  that  the  JPDO  role  as  an  honest
broker  with  partner  agencies  can  be  enhanced  by  the  recent  FAA
restructuring.  As  planning  melds  into  implementation,  the  oper-
ating  agency,  with  all  responsibility  and  at  the  end  of  the  day  all
the  accountability,  will  be  the  FAA.  And  JPDO-participation  agen-
cies need to be engaged and ensured that their work will be closely
integrated  and  aligned  with  key  milestones  and  measured  under  a
new structure.

And  we  have  two  recommendations  for  metrics  for  success.  The
first is implementation of this incremental plan that I am prepared
to  describe  in  more  detail.  The  second  is  that  FAA  and  industry,
possibly  through  our  Institute  Management  Council,  develop
NextGen  measures  of  success  and  milestones.  For  NextGen  we  be-
lieve  the  industry  does  have  valuable  process  expertise  as  well  as
subject matter expertise to offer.

We  also  note  the  recent  developments  in  energy  and  its  impact
on NextGen can’t be ignored. But consideration of NextGen benefits
must  be  expanded  beyond  capacity  improvements  to  include
NextGen’s energy and environmental benefits.

AIA is encouraged at FAA’s response in this arena, as they have
begun  integrating  modeling  of  energy  and  environmental  con-
sequences  such  as  fuel  burn  and  noise,  with  the  modeling  of  air-
craft operations.

We  also  have  an  idea  for  incentivising  early  NextGen  equipage.
With the significant energy and environmental benefits of NextGen
we  believe  Congress  should  consider  energy  tax  credits  for  early
NextGen equipage. We do it for cars, home improvements, and ap-
pliances. Why not aviation, at least for early equipage?

And  finally,  while  FAA  can  speak  more  authoritatively  about
this,  we  believe  the  lack  of  an  FAA  budget  will  seriously  hamper
NextGen  development  and  progress.  And  industry  is  on  record  as
strongly  endorsing  the  integration  of  NextGen  with  day-to-day  air
system operations and JPDO long-term planning.

Because AIA members populate all of the working groups and co-
chair  seven  of  our  nine  groups,  we  are  in  a  good  position  to  evalu-
ate  FAA  restructuring.  Our  members  uniformly  support  this
change,  for  it  keeps  the  work  plan  where  it  belongs,  closer  to  the
implementing  agency,  and  keeps  longer-term  planning  within
divisionary construct of JPDO.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PAUL G. KAMINSKI

Good  afternoon  Chairman  Gordon,  Ranking  Member  Hall,  and  Members  of  the
Committee.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  before  you  today.  My  name  is
Paul  Kaminski.  I  am  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Technovation,
Inc., and a senior partner in Global Technology Partners—but I am here today rep-
resenting  the  Aerospace  Industries  Association  (AIA).  Since  January,  I  have  been
representing  AIA  on  the  Institute  Management  Council  of  the  NextGen  Institute
that oversees industry participation in the JPDO.

Representing nearly 300 manufacturing companies with more than 642,000 high-
wage, highly skilled employees, AIA operates as the largest aerospace trade associa-
tion in the United States across three sectors: civil aviation, space systems, and na-
tional  defense.  AIA  member  companies  export  48  percent  of  their  total  output  and
they routinely post the Nation’s largest manufacturing trade surplus, at a level ap-
proaching  $60  billion  in  2007.  The  aerospace  industry  continues  to  look  to  the  fu-
ture,  investing  heavily  in  R&D  and  spending  more  than  $50  billion  over  the  last
15 years.

I  last  testified  before  you  in  June  of  2006  when  I  chaired  the  National  Research
Council’s  Committee  on  the  Decadal  Survey  of  Civil  Aeronautics.  Then  I  said:  ‘‘The
U.S.  air  transportation  system  is  a  key  contributor  to  the  economic  vitality,  public
wellbeing,  and  national  security  of  the  United  States.’’  I  endorsed  the  need  to  im-
prove  our  air  transportation  system  then,  and  I  believe  that  need  is  even  more  im-
portant today with the high cost of fuel and the growing concerns about the environ-
ment.

NextGen—with  its  capacity,  efficiency,  energy,  environmental  and  safety  bene-

fits—must be a strong and urgent priority for the Nation.

Marion  Blakey,  former  FAA  Administrator  and  now  President  of  AIA,  sought  my
assistance  with  the  IMC  in  January  of  this  year  because  of  my  commitment  to  im-
proving  NextGen,  and  my  experience  in  the  development  and  acquisition  of  large,
complex systems in the Department of Defense.

Working  with  AIA,  I  proposed  a  method  to  accelerate  the  development,  acquisi-
tion,  integration  and  implementation  of  the  NextGen  System  based  on  the  tech-
niques  that  we  used  to  accelerate  development  and  fielding  of  the  F–117  program.
This  method  is  very  effective  in  dealing  with  large,  complex  systems  that  depend
upon effective integration of numerous enabling technologies and complex operating
procedures.

But  before  I  get  into  detail  about  this  AIA  proposal  for  development  and  acquisi-

tion, I want to highlight a few other important points:

1. Systems engineering and integration will critical to the success of NextGen—
and  that’s  the  lynchpin  to  this  proposal  I’ll  discuss  shortly.  I  expect  our  na-
tion’s  efforts  on  NextGen  to  continue  for  a  long  time,  as  new  technology
enablers will continue to appear and we must consider the cost and benefits
of advanced technology within our systems engineering foundation. We must
also continue to consider the cost and benefits of maintaining legacy systems
that will become obsolete. In a sense, NextGen will be like painting the Gold-
en  Gate  bridge—when  we  finish  the  north  end,  it  will  be  time  to  come  back
and  begin  at  the  south  end.  So  we  should  prepare  the  foundation  with  that
extended  process  in  mind.  But  that  doesn’t  mean  that  we  shouldn’t  move
with dispatch.

2. This  AIA  proposal  allows  us  to  begin  now  to  build  a  little  and  test  a  little,
layering  and  linking  capabilities.  It  will  help  to  better  define  and  prioritize
the essential NextGen R&D for both FAA and JPDO partner agencies. It will
also  provide  critically  important  ‘‘domain  experience’’  to  key  personnel  in
both  government  and  industry.  This  domain  experience  in  both  government
and  industry  is  a  requisite  for  the  systems  engineering  and  integration  re-
quired in large scale, complex programs such as NextGen. I recently chaired
a National Research Council review of systems engineering which recognized
the importance of strengthening systems engineering skills to avoid problems
associated  with  the  acquisition  of  large  and  complex  systems.  The  FAA  has
recently  initiated  a  program  to  enhance  systems  engineering  education—a
good first step.

3. AIA believes that JPDO’s role as an honest broker with partner agencies can
be enhanced by the recent FAA restructuring. As planning melds into imple-
mentation, the operating agency—with all the responsibility and, at the end
of  the  day,  all  the  accountability—is  the  FAA.  JPDO  participating  agencies
should  be  engaged  and  assured  that  their  work  will  be  more  closely  inte-
grated,  aligned  with  key  milestones  and  measured  under  the  new  structure.
4. AIA  has  two  recommendations  for  metrics  of  success—and  they  are  not  ex-
clusive.  The  first—as  I  will  elaborate  soon—is  implementation  of  NextGen
incremental leave-behind capabilities using a rigorous implementation sched-
ule. Second, we suggest that FAA and industry—possibly through the IMC—
develop NextGen measures of success and milestones. For NextGen, industry
has  valuable  process  expertise,  as  well  as  subject  matter  expertise,  to  offer.
5. Recent  developments  with  energy  and  its  impact  on  NextGen  cannot  be  ig-
nored.  The  consideration  of  NextGen  benefits  must  be  expanded  beyond  ca-
pacity improvement to include NextGen’s energy and environmental benefits.
AIA  is  encouraged  at  FAA’s  quick  response,  as  they  have  begun  integrating
modeling of energy and environmental consequences—such as fuel burn and
noise—with modeling of aircraft operations and systemwide operations. This
will  help  quantify  energy  and  environmental  benefits  of  NextGen  improve-
ments to strengthen the NextGen business case.

6. We also have an idea for incentivizing early NextGen equipage. With the sig-
nificant energy and environmental benefits of NextGen, Congress should con-

sider energy tax credits for early NextGen equipage. We do it for cars, home
improvements and appliances, why not aviation—at least for early equipage?
7. While  FAA  can  speak  more  authoritatively  about  this,  lack  of  a  new  FAA
budget will seriously hamper NextGen development and progress. And indus-
try  is  on  record  as  strongly  endorsing  the  integration  of  NextGen  with  day-
to-day  air  system  operations  and  JPDO  long-term  planning.  Because  AIA
members  populate  all  of  the  working  groups  and  co-chair  seven  of  the  nine
groups,  we  are  in  a  good  position  to  evaluate  the  FAA  restructuring:  Our
members  uniformly  support  this  change  for  it  keeps  the  work  plan  where  it
belongs—closer  to  the  implementing  agency—and  keeps  longer-term  plan-
ning within the visionary construct of JPDO.

Now,  to  discuss  how  we  can  accelerate  the  transition  from  NextGen  system  con-

cepts and R&D to implementation. See attached briefing charts.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  IAN  A.  WAITZ,  PARTNER  DIRECTOR;  JE-
ROME C. HUNSAKER PROFESSOR OF AERONAUTICS AND AS-
TRONAUTICS;  HEAD,  DEPARTMENT  OF  AERONAUTICS  AND
ASTRONAUTICS,  MASSACHUSETTS  INSTITUTE  OF  TECH-
NOLOGY
Dr.  WAITZ.  Chairman  Gordon  and  Members  of  the  Committee,
thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  the  status  of
NextGen  with  regard  to  impacts  on  the  environment.  I  am  the
head  of  the  Department  of  Aeronautics  and  Astronautics  at  MIT
and  Director  of  the  Partnership  for  AiR  Transportation  Noise  and
Emissions  Reduction,  also  known  as  PARTNER.  I  would  like  to
note  that  I  have  also  provided  a  more-detailed  written  statement.
At  PARTNER,  an  FAA/NASA/Transport  Canada-funded  Center
of  Excellence,  we  focus  on  energy  aviation  and  the  environment.
We  have  more  than  50  graduate  students  working  with  faculty
members  at  a  dozen  universities.  More  than  50  U.S.  and  inter-
national  organizations  collaborate  with  us  and  are  represented  on
our advisory board.

In 2004, we wrote a report to Congress on aviation and the envi-
ronment  on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  Transportation  and  the  Ad-
ministrator  of  NASA.  The  report  put  forward  a  national  vision  for
aviation  in  the  environment  that  specifies  absolute  reductions  in
significant  health  and  welfare  impacts  from  aviation  noise  and  air
quality  and  reduced  uncertainty  in  understanding  other  emissions
or other impacts such as climate.

Since  2004,  when  we  wrote  the  report,  the  challenges  facing  us
have  grown  more  significantly.  Aircraft  noise  affects  five  million
people in the United States. It is the single greatest barrier to add-
ing  new  runways  and  expanding  airport  operations,  and  through
the  constraints  it  places  on  the  growth  of  our  Air  Transportation
System,  it  produces  significant  negative  impacts  on  our  national
economy.

Further,  we  spend  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  on  a  band-aid
approach  of  soundproofing  homes  around  airports  rather  than  in-
vesting in the technology which is the only long-term solution.

In terms of air quality, aircraft are responsible for less than one
percent  of  health  impacts  associated  with  poor  air  quality  in  the
United  States  as  a  whole,  yet  these  impacts  are  still  very  impor-
tant, one to 200 perhaps more premature deaths each year.

In  regards  to  climate  change,  most  estimates  suggest  that  per
unit of fuel burned the impact of aircraft on climate is more signifi-
cant  than  that  impact  from  land-based  sources.  Climate  is  also  an
area  where  there  is  a  vigorous  international  debate.  For  example,
around  EU  plans  to  include  international  aviation  in  an  emissions
trading program.

Unfortunately, this is also an area where the United States most
significantly  lags  our  European  colleagues.  Our  entire  portfolio  of
research  is  likely  less  than  $1  million  per  year.  This  for  the  most
uncertain  and  potentially  most  damaging  environmental  impact  of
aviation.

In terms of jointly addressing the challenges of noise, air quality,
and  climate  change,  and  achieving  absolute  reductions  in  impacts
at  the  same  time  the  system  is  growing,  history  provides  a  lesson.
In  the  ’70s,  ’80s,  and  ’90s,  we  had  a  95  percent  reduction  in  the

number  of  people  impacted  by  aircraft  noise.  At  the  same  time  we
had a six-fold increase in passenger miles traveled.

And  at  that  very  same  time  we  had  a  60  percent  improvement
in energy efficiency, more than any other mode of transport. All of
those remarkable improvements came from technology that was de-
rived  from  strong  FAA,  NASA,  industry,  university  research  pro-
grams.

Today further improvements are possible, improvements that can
enable  us  to  achieve  absolute  reductions  while  we  grow.  However,
achieving  these  improvements  is  dependent  on  making  the  right
decisions,  and  that  requires  a  healthy  scientific  research  program
and also on sufficient sustained investments in the development of
new technologies, NextGen operations, and alternative fuels.

So what has changed since we wrote the 2004 report to Congress
on  aviation  and  environment?  The  most  important  change  is  that
the  challenges  we  are  facing  have  gotten  even  more  significant.  In
particular, if we were writing the report today, we would likely add
contributions to climate change to the list of impacts we would seek
to reduce in absolute terms, and there would be much greater focus
on energy dependence.

There have also been some successes in the last four years since
we  wrote  the  report  to  Congress.  The  FAA  Office  of  Environment
and  Energy  headed  by  Carl  Burleson  and  Chief  Scientist  Dr.
Lourdes  Maurice,  have  led  a  sea  change  in  the  FAA.  They  have
adopted  a  rigorous  science-based  approach  to  understanding  avia-
tion’s  impacts  and  making  policy  decisions  based  on  that.  Under
their leadership with the participation of many others, I believe the
environmental  working  group  of  JPDO  is  regarded  as  one  of  the
best.

Today the two most critical issues that we must address are first
to  accelerate  the  FAA/NASA  Aviation  Climate  Change  Research
Initiative  and  second,  to  significantly  increase  the  focus,  tech-
nology,  operations,  and  alternative  fuels  programs  in  NASA  and
FAA  that  are  required  to  effectively  bridge  fundamental  aero-
nautics research and industrial development programs.

This is consistent with the pending FAA and NASA Reauthoriza-
tion  Bills,  and  I  sincerely  thank  this  committee  for  its  efforts  in
that  regard.  It  is  the  right  thing  to  do  for  the  health  of  the  planet
and  for  the  health  of  the  public.  It  is  the  right  thing  to  do  for  the
economy.

The  constraints  on  the  system  are  sufficiently  strong  that  they
can impede realizing the potential of NextGen. If we do not achieve
significant  advances  in  environmental  performance,  there  will  be
increasing  impacts  on  health  and  welfare  and  increasing  con-
straints on the National Air Transportation System with the nega-
tive economic impacts that come with both.

Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  this  com-
mittee  for  the  opportunity  to  address  you.  I  will  be  pleased  to  re-
spond to your questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF IAN A. WAITZ

the  Head  of  the  Department  of  Aeronautics  and  Astronautics  at  the  Massachusetts
Institute  of  Technology  and  Director  of  the  Partnership  for  AiR  Transportation
Noise  and  Emissions  Reduction  (PARTNER).  For  17  years  I  have  conducted  re-
search  directed  towards  understanding  and  reducing  the  environmental  impacts  of
aviation.  This  work  has  spanned  climate  change,  air  quality,  noise,  and  economic
effects,  and  has  included  technological,  operational,  and  policy  dimensions.  I  work
closely with the FAA Office of Environment and Energy.

My  written  testimony  is  organized  in  six  sections.  Section  I  briefly  describes
PARTNER.  Section  2  summarizes  the  key  findings  from  the  2004  Report  to  Con-
gress on Aviation and the Environment. Section 3 provides an overview of noise, air
quality, and climate change issues related to the national air transportation system.
Within this section, I make several comments on current FAA and NASA programs
and plans. In Section 4 I draw from the discussions of the Section 3 noise, air qual-
ity,  and  climate  change  overview  and  summarize  what  has  changed  since  the  2004
Report to Congress on Aviation and the Environment. In Section 5 I share my views
on  the  progress  of  the  NextGen  initiative  and  the  Joint  Planning  and  Development
Office  (JPDO).  Section  6  concludes  with  the  issues  that  I  feel  most  urgently  need
to be addressed.

My main message is that the United States must accelerate efforts to address the
environmental  impacts  of  aviation.  It  is  the  right  thing  to  do  for  the  health  of  the
public  and  the  planet.  It  is  also  the  right  thing  to  do  for  the  economy.  If  we  do  not
achieve  significant  advances  in  environmental  performance  there  will  be  increasing
impacts on health and welfare, and increasing constraints on the national air trans-
portation  system—with  the  attendant  negative  economic  impacts  that  come  with
both.  The  constraints  are  sufficiently  strong  that  they  can  impede  realizing  the  po-
tential of the Next Generation Air Transportation System. I therefore strongly sup-
port increases in funding for environmental research, development, and demonstra-
tion programs, such as those described in the pending FAA and NASA Reauthoriza-
tions.  The  priority  must  be  on  appropriating  funds  to  programs  that  address  avia-
tion’s  environmental  impacts  starting  with  the  FY09  budget.  Thereafter,  authoriza-
tion and appropriation of funding for more significant programs are required.

1. PARTNER

PARTNER  is  an  FAA/NASA/Transport  Canada-funded  Center  of  Excellence,
founded in 2003, that focuses on improving the scientific understanding of aviation’s
environmental  impacts,  and  on  assessing,  developing,  and  implementing  techno-
logical,  operational,  and  policy  options  for  mitigating  these  environmental  impacts.
Educating  future  researchers  and  leaders  in  aviation  and  environment  is  an  over-
arching  goal.  We  have  more  than  fifty  graduate  students  working  with  leading  fac-
ulty  members  at  the  Georgia  Institute  of  Technology,  Harvard  University  School  of
Public  Health,  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology,  Pennsylvania  State  Univer-
sity,  Purdue  University,  Stanford  University,  Missouri  University  of  Science  and
Technology,  University  of  North  Carolina,  York  University  in  Canada,  and  Univer-
sity of Reading and University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.

One  of  PARTNER’s  greatest  strengths  is  our  advisory  board.  More  than  50  U.S.
and international organizations are represented including aerospace manufacturers,
airlines, airports, national, State and local government, professional and trade asso-
ciations, non-governmental organizations and community groups.

Hundreds  of  PARTNER  investigators,  students,  and  advisory  board  members
have  worked  collaboratively  over  the  last  five  years  under  the  sponsorship  of  the
FAA, NASA, Transport Canada, DOD, and the Airports Cooperative Research Coun-
cil (ACRD) to advance understanding of the relationship between aviation and envi-
ronment. This work has included:

• designing and testing alternate descent patterns as a no/low-cost means to re-

duce aircraft landing noise, fuel consumption, and pollutant emissions

• three  significant  measurement  campaigns  at  U.S.  airports  to  assess  and  un-

derstand the formation of particulate matter from aircraft

• collaborating  with  NASA  and  industry  studying  noise  acceptability  of  super-

sonic flight over land

encroachment

• examining land use, noise, and local development dynamics related to airport

• assessment of the human health and welfare risks of aviation noise, local air

quality, and climate change impacts

• analyses of the costs and benefits of alternative fuels for aviation

• development  of  aircraft  and  air  transportation  system  simulations  to  assess
policies, technologies and operational options for enabling environmentally re-
sponsible air transportation growth

• online  resource  development  to  better  inform  the  public  about  aircraft  noise

issues.

2. 2004 Report to Congress on Aviation and the Environment

One  of  the  first  collaborative  endeavors  undertaken  by  PARTNER  was  to  draft  a
report  to  the  United  States  Congress  on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  Transportation
and  the  Administrator  of  NASA.  The  report,  which  is  titled  Aviation  and  the  Envi-
ronment: A National Vision Statement, Framework for Goals, and Recommended Ac-
tions,  represents  the  collective  views  of  a  broad  range  of  stakeholders.  Thirty-eight
organizations participated, spanning the aerospace industry, NASA, FAA, the Envi-
ronmental  Protection  Agency,  Department  of  Commerce,  Department  of  Defense,
academia,  State  and  local  governments,  and  community  activists.  It  was  my  privi-
lege  to  be  the  lead  author  of  the  report  (http://mit.edu/aeroastro/partner/reports/
congrept¥aviation¥envirn.pdf).

The  report’s  most  important  element  is  a  proposal  for  a  National  Vision  State-
ment  for  Aviation  and  the  Environment.  This  vision  statement  was  supported  by
every one of the 59 stakeholders who participated in drafting it. The National Vision
specifies absolute reductions in significant health and welfare impacts from aviation
noise  and  air  quality  emissions—notwithstanding  growth,  reduced  uncertainty  in
understanding  other  impacts,  and  global  leadership  for  the  U.S.  aerospace  enter-
prise in addressing aviation mobility and environmental needs.

To  achieve  this  challenging  vision,  the  2004  Report  to  Congress  on  Aviation  and
the Environment recommends three actions. The first is to promote coordination and
communication among stakeholders. This should be interpreted as a call for a struc-
ture like the Joint Planning and Development Office. The second is to develop more
effective tools and metrics for guiding policy decisions and for planning research in-
vestments.  This  is  the  area  where  some  of  the  most  important  advances  are  occur-
ring  within  FAA,  but  also  where  further  work  is  required  in  the  area  of  climate
change. The third recommended action is to establish a vigorous program to develop
specific  technological,  operational  and  policy  options  that  support  a  balanced  ap-
proach to long-term environmental improvements. My concerns are greatest with re-
gard to progress on this third action.

This  vision  and  the  recommended  actions  have  been  adopted  as  the  basis  for  the
environmental  objectives  and  plans  of  the  NextGen  Initiative,1 the  FAA’s  National

Aviation  Research  Plan,2 and  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council’s  Na-
tional Plan for Aeronautics Research and Development.3

I  will  return  to  the  findings  of  this  report  later  in  my  testimony.  In  particular,
as you have requested, I will comment on what has changed since the report’s publi-
cation (Section 4), share my views on the progress of the NextGen initiative and the
JPDO  (Section  5),  and  identify  the  issues  I  believe  most  urgently  need  to  be  ad-
dressed (Section 6).

3. Aviation, Environment and Mobility

Before  commenting  specifically  on  the  NextGen  initiative,  it  is  useful  to  describe
what  we  know  and  do  not  know  about  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  U.S.  air
transportation system, and to set these impacts in the context of environmental im-
pacts from other sources. I start by sharing two quotes:

‘‘Flying—the  worst  thing,to  do  .

.

.  The  dirtiest  industry  in  the  world.’’

B. Sewill, Fly Now, Grieve Later, 2005
. unrelenting carbon-efficient improvement is business as usual for
.  We  are  the  greenest  form  of  mass  transpor-

.

.

‘‘.
commercial  airlines  .
tation.’’

J.C. May, ATA President and CEO, Congressional Testimony, 2007

What are we to make of these differences of opinion? In Europe for example, sen-
timents  in  the  press,  and  those  held  by  many  in  the  public,  are  quite  negative.  It
is  ‘‘common  knowledge’’  for  some  that  aviation  is  a  dirty  business.  This  common
knowledge  is  not  consistent  with  scientific  assessments.  There  are  certainly  impor-
tant  impacts  on  human  health,  welfare,  and  ecological  systems  from  aviation  that
must  be  addressed  (I  detail  many  of  these  below).  However,  it  is  equally  true  that
the air transportation industry has made, and can continue to make, significant im-
provements. For example, in the last 30 years, there was a 60 percent reduction in
energy  intensity  in  air  transportation,  a  reduction  that  is  larger  than  that  of  any
other  mode  of  transportation.  Indeed,  between  2000  and  2007,  fuel  use  and  CO2
emissions  from  U.S.  commercial  aviation  have  decreased  by  three  percent  in  abso-
lute  terms  despite  12  percent  more  passenger  movements  and  22  percent  more
freight flown.4

More  importantly,  further  improvements  are  possible  with  new  technologies  and
new  fuels—improvements  that  will  enable  aviation  to  remain  a  small,  and  possibly
even  decreasing,  contributor  to  the  overall  environmental  burden  of  human  activi-
ties. However, achieving these improvements is dependent on making the right deci-
sions  (which  requires  healthy  scientific  research  programs),  and  on  sufficient,  sus-
tained  investments  in  the  development  of  new  technologies,  operational  procedures
and  alternative  fuels.  Thus,  while  it  is  possible  for  aviation’s  impacts  on  the  envi-
ronment  to  be  reduced  in  absolute  terms,  it  is  more  probable  at  our  current  levels
of investment that aviation environmental impacts will grow—contributing to great-
er  detriments  on  health  and  welfare,  and  further  constraints  on  our  air  transpor-
tation system and the economic growth it enables.

I  started  with  the  two  quotes,  ‘‘Flying—the  worst  thing  to  do,’’  and  ‘‘. . .  the
greenest form of mass transportation,’’ to focus your attention to the value of knowl-
edge,  knowledge  that  can  be  used  to  make  rational  judgments  about  what  matters,
why  it  matters,  and  to  whom  it  matters.  Aircraft,  and  the  air  transportation  sys-
tems  in  which  they  operate  are  highly  optimized  complex  systems.  As  such,  there
are  important  tradeoffs  and  interdependencies.  For  example,  if  one  designs  an  air-
plane  to  minimize  noise,  impacts  on  climate  and  air  quality  can  worsen  and  vice
versa. Further, there are almost always important safety and economic implications
that come with design changes. How should one decide what is more or less impor-
tant?

The  issues  highlighted  by  the  quotes  I  shared  go  well  beyond  posturing  in  the
press. The public and political views in Europe and the United States, and the poli-
cies  to  which  they  may  lead,  will  affect  us  all—for  better  or  for  worse.  Aviation  is
a  global  business,  with  airplanes  designed  by  a  small  number  of  suppliers,  largely
for a single global market. If policies are imposed in one part of the world that push
aircraft design in a certain direction, all of us will fly on those airplanes. Therefore,

cent.

there is a premium on getting the answer right when assessing tradeoffs and inter-
dependencies.  This  is  especially  true  because  new  airplane  development  times  are
as  long  as  a  decade,  and  airplane  usage  in  the  fleet  is  as  long  as  three  decades.  In
aviation, when we make decisions, they tend to be expensive, and we must live with
them for a long time.

It is in this area, the area of developing the knowledge and tools to make rational
decisions  about  environmental  impacts,  where  the  FAA,  in  particular  its  Office  of
Environment  and  Energy,  has  been  leading  the  world.  The  FAA  has  adopted  a  rig-
orous, rational, science-based approach to understanding what matters, why it mat-
ters,  and  to  whom  it  matters.  This  is  the  most  critical  first  step  to  taking  action,
especially  for  a  system  as  complex  as  our  national  air  transportation  system.  A  de-
tailed plan for research aimed at further developing this understanding is contained
within  the  latest  draft  of  the  NextGen  Integrated  Work  Plan.5 I  was  one  of  many
people who participated in developing the plan, and I strongly support it.

In  the  next  three  subsections,  I  describe  in  turn  issues  related  to  aviation  noise,
air quality impacts, and climate change. Many of the estimates of impacts I describe
come from research programs funded in the last five years by the FAA Office of En-
vironment  and  Energy.  Many  of  the  significant  technological  advances  that  I  de-
scribe were enabled and promoted by NASA Aeronautics research and development
programs of the 1970s–1990s.

3.1 Noise

There  are  approximately  one-half  million  people  in  the  United  States  who  live  in
regions  near  airports  with  high  levels  of  aircraft  noise,  noise  levels  such  that  more
than  12  percent  of  the  impacted  population  will  be  highly  annoyed.6 People  are
awakened  at  night,  housing  values  are  depreciated,  learning  in  schools  is  reduced.
An  estimated  five  million  people  live  in  areas  with  moderate  airplane  noise,  but
still,  where  greater  than  three  percent  of  the  population  will  be  highly  annoyed.7
Adding these groups together (those in significant and moderate noise areas), there
are  perhaps  200,000  people  in  the  United  States  who  are  highly  annoyed  by  com-
mercial  aircraft  noise.  Despite  the  magnitude  of  the  number,  it  is  small  compared
to  the  number  of  people  living  in  homes  in  city  centers,  and  along  all  of  the  high-
ways and railways in the United States, where residents suffer similarly from high
noise levels.

Further,  we  have  seen  dramatic  95  percent  reductions  in  the  number  of  people
impacted by aircraft noise over the last 35 years (while the population impacted by
highway and railway noise is estimated to have increased), and this is despite a six-
fold growth in aviation passenger-miles traveled. However, most projections suggest
that  advances  in  aircraft  technology  will  barely  be  able  to  keep  up  with  growth  in
order  to  keep  aircraft  noise  impacts  in  the  United  States  constant.  Meanwhile,  we
spend  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  each  year  on  soundproofing  homes  (which  is
little  more  than  a  band-aid),  local  authorities  continue  to  make  poor  land-use  deci-
sions  (allowing  residential  development  in  high  noise  regions),  and  we  burn  extra
fuel for some noise abatement procedures at airports (and suffer the associated eco-
nomic,  climate,  and  air  quality  detriments).  Most  importantly,  the  very  valid  com-
plaints  of  residents  around  airports  have  almost  halted  the  airport  expansion  that
could  be  so  vital  to  our  economy.  The  limits  on  airport  expansion  lead  to  further
congestion of our airspace, more flight delays, economic losses, and even more envi-
ronmental impacts. The Chinese are in the process of building some 50 airports, and
expanding  another  70.  In  contrast,  consider  Boston  where  I  live:  efforts  to  add  a
third runway to Logan Airport started in the 1970s. The runway was only half-com-
pleted  when  community  opposition  led  to  a  court  injunction  halting  construction.
The  injunction  was  not  lifted  until  2003—30  years  of  less  efficient,  less  productive
operations that to a large extent were due to concerns about aviation noise.

With  this  as  context,  it  is  useful  to  understand  what  led  to  the  dramatic  reduc-
tions  in  aviation  noise  impact  that  occurred  in  the  1980s  and  1990s.  These  were  a
direct  result  of  technological  advancements  (especially  the  introduction  of  the  high
bypass  ratio  turbofan  engine)  and  policy  incentives  (accelerated  phase-out  of  older,
noisier aircraft—a phase-out that is estimated to have cost the industry between $5
billion  and  $10  billion).  These  technological  advancements  were  founded  on  robust
NASA–FAA–industry–university research and development activities.

In  the  last  several  years,  funding  for  the  NASA  Aeronautics  Program  has  been
insufficient to support such robust research and development activities. As a result,

NASA  Aeronautics  has  shifted  its  focus  relatively  more  towards  long-term,  funda-
mental research, with relatively less emphasis on the more costly, system-level tech-
nology  acceleration  and  implementation  programs.  This  is  an  appropriate  strategy
given  the  limited  funding—fundamental  research  is  the  foundation  upon  which  all
the other efforts are built. However, it is not a strategy that is promoting the devel-
opment  and  implementation  of  low  noise  technology  to  the  degree  that  is  required.
While  the  modest  augmentations  in  recent  NASA  Aeronautics  budgets  have  been
welcome, they have varied from year to year, making it difficult to launch the multi-
year  programs  that  are  necessary  for  success.  I  note  that  the  NASA  programs  are
strongly  driven  by  the  NextGen  goals,  and  are  explicitly  incorporated  in  the
NextGen Integrated Work Plan. The team is well coordinated. The missing element
is  an  increased  and  sustained  funding  commitment.  The  FAA  FY09  budget  request
also includes funds to more rapidly develop and implement low noise technology and
procedures  (as  one  component  of  the  Continuous  Lower  Energy,  Emissions,  and
Noise  Program,  CLEEN).  This  program,  with  a  proposed  budget  of  $22M  per  year
(for  all  objectives,  not  just  noise  reduction)  can  be  an  important  contributor  to  an
effective, vertically-integrated national research and development program. But here
too, funds must be appropriated.

Thus, while we underfund the research and development that is the only pathway
to long-term improvement, we continue to spend hundreds of millions of dollars each
year on the band-aid approach of soundproofing homes and purchasing land around
airports.  Because  we  have  under-invested  in  research  and  development,  this  band-
aid  is  indeed,  the  only  option  for  residents  near  airports,  residents  who  justifiably
have  had  enough  with  bearing  the  burden  of  the  high  noise  environments.  The  na-
tional  strategy  for  addressing  aircraft  noise  is  broken.  New  technology  can  change
the  equation  and  significantly  reduce  the  requirements  for  soundproofing  and  the
hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  it  drains  from  the  Airport  and  Airway  Trust  Fund
through  the  Airport  Improvement  Program.8 We  must  challenge  the  Nation’s  gov-
ernment-industry-university  research  enterprise  to  do  this  and  we  must  appro-
priately  fund  it.  This  will  break  the  logjam  between  aircraft  noise  and  airport  ex-
pansion,  promote  economic  growth,  reduce  health  and  welfare  impacts  on  residents
living near airports, and contribute to scientific and technological advancement.

3.2 Air Quality

Commercial  aviation  is  responsible  for  between  two  percent  and  three  percent  of
U.S.  energy  consumption,  almost  all  of  it  from  petroleum.  The  competitiveness  of
the  industry  and  the  high  fraction  of  costs  related  to  fuel,  have  led  to  a  level  of
penny-pinching  for  energy  efficiency  that  is  unparalleled.  Airlines  make  decisions
about seemingly minute items to optimize their financial performance (such as eval-
uating whether or not to limit the availability of ice cubes as part of the drink serv-
ice  to  improve  fuel  efficiency).  The  incentives  for  fuel  efficiency  are  extreme.  How-
ever,  as  with  other  users  of  fossil  fuels,  the  combustion  of  these  fuels  leads  to  gas-
eous and particulate matter emissions that can adversely affect human health. Only
those emissions emitted below 3,000 feet above ground level are traditionally consid-
ered in EPA national inventories and in air quality evaluations, although emerging
work suggests that emissions at higher altitudes may also be important for surface
air quality. The aviation emissions below 3,000 feet represent between 0.03 percent
and  0.4  percent  of  the  total  National  Emissions  Inventory  levels  depending  on  the
particular  pollutant.9 However,  in  many  U.S.  counties  the  contribution  to  county-
level  inventories  can  be  as  high  as  several  percent  (rising  to  as  high  as  20  percent
to 50 percent for some pollutants in four counties only). Moreover, there are 148 air-
ports located in non-attainment areas that do not meet National Ambient Air Qual-
ity  Standards  for  one  or  more  pollutants.  So  small  contributions  can  still  be  quite
important.

To  my  knowledge,  the  FAA  is  the  only  organization  in  the  world  that  is  specifi-
cally  funding  research  to  understand  the  health  impacts  that  are  attributable  to
these  aviation  emissions.  It  should  be  commended  for  this.  It  is  another  example
of  the  FAA’s  rational,  rigorous  approach  to  understanding  what  matters  and  why
it matters. It is important to do so, because even within the different pollutant emis-
sions,  there  are  important  trade-offs.  For  example,  high  temperature  engines  that

95  percent  of  operations  for  which  flight  plans  were  filed,  represent  the  following  percentages
of  the  total  2001  U.S.  National  Emissions  inventory  for  anthropogenic  sources:  0.17  percent  of
carbon  monoxide  (CO)  emissions,  0.40  percent  of  oxides  of  nitrogen  (NOΧ)  emissions,  0.23  per-
cent  of  emissions  of  volatile  organic  compounds  (VOCs),  0.06  percent  of  oxides  of  sulfur  (SOΧ)
emissions, and 0.03 percent of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions.

reduce  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions  can  increase  emissions  of  oxides  of  nitrogen
(NOΧ). A second example is related to emissions of hazardous air pollutants. At the
time when we wrote the 2004 Report to Congress, we listed these as one of the high-
est  areas  of  uncertainty  for  aviation.  Four  years  later,  research  funded  by  the  FAA
and the Airports Cooperative Research Council is showing that hazardous air pollut-
ants from aviation are not a source of significant health impacts.

Of  aviation  emissions,  those  that  contribute  to  ambient  fine  particulate  matter
(PM2.5)  are  the  most  significant  source  of  adverse  heath  consequences.  More  than
95  percent  of  total  health  impacts  attributable  to  aviation  are  estimated  to  come
from exposure to increased levels of ambient particulate matter. The emissions that
contribute  include  sulfur  oxides,  nitrogen  oxides,  volatile  organic  emissions  (these
three  groups  of  emissions  are  mostly  emitted  as  gases,  but  later  in  the  atmosphere
they  lead  to  secondary  formation  of  particulate  matter),  and  also  primary  particu-
late  matter  emissions  (soot).  In  recent  studies,  the  average  contribution  of  aircraft
to  ambient  levels  of  PM2.5 in  the  United  States  was  estimated  to  be  less  than  one-
tenth  of  one  percent:  0.08  percent  for  all  counties  and  0.06  percent  for  counties  in
air quality non-attainment areas. The aircraft contributions to county-level ambient
PM2.5 concentrations  ranged  from  0  percent  to  0.5  percent.  However,  this  is  likely
an  underestimate  since  only  emissions  below  3,000  feet  were  considered  and  the
geographical resolution of the models was limited.

Although the impacts are quite small relative to all human impacts on air quality,
they  are  important.  Using  standard  health  risk  assessment  approaches,  approxi-
mately  160  yearly  incidences  of  premature  mortality  can  be  attributed  to  the  avia-
tion  emissions  below  3,000  feet.  These  health  impacts  of  aviation  very  likely  con-
stitute less than 0.6 percent of the total adverse health impacts due to poor air qual-
ity from all anthropogenic emissions sources in the United States—underscoring the
overall significance of the health risk associated with poor air quality in the United
States which very likely contributes to more than 25,000 premature mortalities each
year.

The  benefits  that  NextGen  can  provide  for  improving  air  quality  may  be  signifi-
cant. Air traffic management inefficiencies, congestion, and delay result in increased
fuel burn and emissions. We have all experienced unacceptably long taxi operations,
waiting  in  long  lines  to  take-off,  or  for  an  airport  gate  to  become  available—all  the
while  with  engines  running,  burning  fuel,  generating  emissions,  and  wasting  time
and money.10 Approximately 10 percent of the fuel burn and emissions below 3,000
feet in today’s system are a direct result of delays and inefficient operations. It will
only  get  worse.  The  air  transportation  system  is  a  traffic  jam  waiting  to  happen.
Without  the  development  of  an  efficient  next  generation  system,  small  numbers  of
additional  operations  (much  smaller  than  the  2x  to  3x  growth  that  is  anticipated)
will  increasingly  cause  gridlock,  especially  in  conditions  with  poor  weather.  There
is  thus,  a  potential  for  significant  adverse  environmental  and  economic  con-
sequences.  This  is  an  area  where  NextGen  planning  and  initiatives  are  appro-
priately targeted. Moreover, the modelling and planning tools used by the NextGen
program now explicitly incorporate the latest results from air quality health impacts
analyses. Although many important scientific questions remain, and it is likely that
the estimates of health impacts will change, the research programs have been initi-
ated, and the linkages are in place so that these effects can be appropriately consid-
ered in NextGen planning and development.

In addition to NextGen operational improvements, there are also options to reduce
air  quality  impacts  through  the  adoption  of  low  sulfur  fuels  and  alternative  fuels.
Recognition of the potential role of alternative fuels is one of the key changes since
the  writing  of  the  2004  Report  to  Congress  on  Aviation  and  the  Environment.  The
FAA  is  moving  aggressively  to  pursue  the  assessment  (including  the  full  life  cycle
impacts), testing, and certification of low sulfur and low carbon alternative fuels. It
is  not  yet  clear  what  the  costs  and  benefits  of  these  options  will  be,  but  FAA  has
put  in  place  a  thoughtful,  effective  research  program  to  develop  and  assess  these
options. The work is a component of a larger work program within the Commercial
Aviation  Alternative  Fuels  Initiative  (CAAFI),  a  broad  government-industry-aca-
demic consortium.

While  the  work  on  operational  improvements  and  new  fuels  is  proceeding  well,
programs  to  develop  aircraft  and  engine  technologies  for  mitigating  air  quality  im-
pacts are not well supported. As with the development of low noise technologies, the
reduced levels of funding for NASA Aeronautics in the last decade have left the Na-
tion  without  sufficiently  strong  focused  technology  programs  that  are  important  for

bridging  fundamental  research  and  industrial  development,  and  thereby  promoting
more rapid advancement of aircraft and engine technology. Here too, the recent aug-
mentations  to  the  NASA  Aeronautics  budget  have  been  helpful,  but  they  are  not
enough—and  they  are  not  sustained,  therefore  making  them  less  effective  for  con-
tributing  to  long-term  development  programs.  The  FAA  can  also  play  an  important
role in addressing the gap with its Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise
Program, CLEEN. However, as I noted previously, this program, with a FY09 budg-
et request of $22M per year for all objectives, is not sufficient to promote the techno-
logical  advances  that  will  be  required  to  reduce  air  quality  impacts  simultaneously
with the anticipated growth of operations.

3.3 Climate Change

Aircraft  emissions  contribute  to  climate  change  by  increasing  the  levels  of  green-
house  gases  in  the  atmosphere.  Commercial  aviation  is  responsible  for  approxi-
mately  2.7  percent  of  U.S.  greenhouse  gas  emissions  (roughly  10  percent  of  the
greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  the  transportation  sector).  Because  of  the  altitude
at  which  aircraft  fly,  the  effects  on  climate  are  unique  among  all  greenhouse  gas
emitters. There are effects related to the formation of condensation trails (contrails)
and  clouds,  and  positive  and  negative  impacts  of  NOΧ emissions  that  can  be  more
pronounced than those from surface-level NOΧ emissions. These effects cannot sim-
ply  be  added  to  the  effects  of  the  CO2 emissions;  they  depend  on  time  of  day,  time
of  year,  altitude  of  the  emissions,  and  region  of  the  globe.  Although  the  impacts  of
aviation CO2 are well understood, and are the same as those from CO2 emitted from
other  sources,  many  of  the  other  effects  are  poorly  understood.  All  of  them  involve
complex chemical and atmospheric processes. However, when these effects are taken
together,  most  estimates  suggest  that  the  impact  of  aviation  on  climate  is  greater
per unit of fuel burn than that from surface-based combustion sources.

As we wrote in the 2004 Report to Congress, this is the area of greatest scientific
uncertainty for aviation, and the area with the greatest potential for environmental
impacts.  It  is  also  an  area  where  there  is  a  vigorous  international  debate  on  meas-
ures  that  should  be  taken  to  mitigate  the  impacts—for  example,  the  debate  sur-
rounding the European Union plans to include commercial aviation in an emissions
trading program. There are also examples closer to home like the petition California
and other states filed with the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from avia-
tion.

Perhaps  nowhere  in  the  area  of  aviation  and  the  environment  is  there  a  greater
premium  on  pursuing  a  rigorous  program  of  scientific  study  that  is  closely  tied  to
national  and  international  decision-making  needs.  This  is  also  the  area  where  the
United  States  most  significantly  lags  our  European  colleagues.  The  United  States
had  a  robust,  vibrant  research  program  (the  Atmospheric  Effects  of  Aviation  Pro-
gram). This program was discontinued around the year 2000. Since that time, most
of our understanding of the impacts of aviation on climate has come from the excel-
lent programs in Europe. Much of the U.S. academic community has disbanded and
gone  on  to  focus  on  other  things.  Although  work  continues,  it  is  not  well  funded  or
well  connected.  Today  in  the  United  States,  the  entire  portfolio  of  funded  research
focusing on aviation and climate is likely less than $1 million per year—for the most
uncertain, and potentially most damaging, environmental impact of aviation. We are
now in a position of being insufficiently prepared to contribute to national and inter-
national  discussions  of  climate  policy  for  aviation—the  latter  of  which  are  likely  to
move ahead with or without us. This is a failure.

To address this critical need, this year the FAA and NASA launched the Aviation
Climate Change Research Initiative. With optimistically11 only $2 million to $3 mil-
lion of funding per year, this effort must be expanded. Without this, we will be un-
able  to  evaluate  the  complex  trade-offs  among  aviation’s  climate  effects—let  alone
balance  them  against  other  objectives  for  noise,  air  quality,  safety,  and  economic
performance  of  the  industry.  This  is  a  case  where  engine,  aircraft,  and  operational
design trades are quite possible, and industry is asking, ‘‘what really matters?’’ but
we  do  not  have  an  answer  for  them.  All  the  while,  airplanes  continue  to  be  built,
airplanes  with  a  30-year  lifetime  in  the  fleet.  We  must  change  the  path  we  are  on,
and to do so, we must move more forcefully than we are moving today.
4. What  has  changed  since  the  2004  Report  to  Congress  on  Aviation  and

Environment?
I  have  addressed  several  points  regarding  changes  since  the  2004  Report  to  Con-
gress  in  Section  3;  I  will  now  summarize  them.  The  report  recommended  three  ac-

tions  to  achieve  a  National  Vision  of  absolute  reductions  in  significant  health  and
welfare  impacts  from  aviation  noise  and  air  quality  emissions,  reduced  uncertainty
in understanding other impacts, and global leadership for the U.S. aerospace enter-
prise  in  jointly  addressing  aviation  mobility  and  environmental  needs.  In  the  last
four  years  there  have  been  some  successes  in  responding  to  this  vision,  and  some
failures.
Changes  relative  to  recommendation  1:  Promoting  coordination  and  com-
munication among stakeholders.

• The National Vision for Aviation and the Environment and Recommended Ac-
tions  drafted  by  a  broad  group  of  stakeholders  was  accepted  and  acted  upon
by  FAA  and  NASA,  and  incorporated  into  the  National  Plan  for  Aeronautics
Research  and  Development  and  Related  Infrastructure  (January  10,  2008).12
• The  Environmental  Working  Group  of  the  JPDO  is  regarded  as  one  of  the
most  effective  groups  within  the  JPDO.  This  is  evidenced  in  the  2005  Na-
tional  Research  Council  Report,  Technology  Pathways:  Assessing  the  Inte-
grated  Plan  for  a  Next  Generation  Air  Transportation  System,  where  the  ac-
tivities  of  the  group  were  highlighted  and  put  forward  as  an  exemplar  for
other components of the JPDO to follow.
• NASA  Aeronautics  programs  and  plans  are  closely  aligned  with  the  needs  of
• FAA  and  NASA  have  cultivated  several  open,  collaborative  research  enter-
prises  focused  on  environment  and  energy  including  the  Partnership  for  AiR
Transportation Noise and Emissions Reduction, the Aviation Climate Change
Research Initiative, the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative, the
Aviation Emissions Characterization Roadmap, the NASA Fundamental Aero-
nautics N+1, N+2 and N+3 research programs, and the Research Consortium
for Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise (CLEEN).

ity impacts of aviation resulting in several seminal contributions.

Changes relative to recommendation 2: Developing more effective tools and
metrics for guiding policy decisions and for planning research investments.
• The FAA has led the world in supporting research to understand the air qual-
• The  FAA  and  NASA  have  led  the  world  in  developing  tools  to  characterize
and  quantify  the  interdependencies  among  aviation-related  noise  and  emis-
sions, impacts on health and welfare, and industry and consumer costs, under
different policy, technology, operational, and market scenarios.
• One of the most significant changes since the 2004 Report to Congress is the
greater  recognition  of  the  importance  of  energy  efficiency,  and  the  potential
value of alternative fuels for reducing the climate change impacts of aviation
and  reducing  our  dependence  on  non-replenishable  resources.  The  FAA  and
the  DOD  have  excellent  programs  in  place  to  rigorously  evaluate  the  full  life
cycle costs and benefits of alternative fuels for aviation.
• Despite laudable efforts this year to launch the Aviation Climate Change Re-
search  Initiative  on  the  part  of  FAA  and  NASA,  the  gap  in  technical  credi-
bility  with  regard  to  aviation  climate  impacts  has  widened  between  the
United  States  and  Europe  in  the  last  four  years.  Most  of  the  significant  re-
search findings are coming from Europe.

Changes relative to recommendation 3: Establishing a vigorous program to
develop specific technological, operational, and policy options that support
a balanced approach to long-term environmental improvements.

• The  FAA  is  well  positioned  to  develop  specific  operational  and  policy  options
(with the notable exception of the aviation climate area) to support long-term
environmental  improvements.  One  highlight  is  its  vigorous  development  and
implementation  of  Continuous  Descent  Arrival  procedures  that  reduce  noise,
reduce emissions, and save fuel.
• Since  the  writing  of  the  2004  Report,  four  more  years  have  passed  without
sufficient  funding  for  the  critical  NASA–FAA–industry–university  technology
development programs that will be required to address the environmental im-
pacts of aviation while enabling growth in air service.

12 The National Plan was developed in response to Executive Order 13419 which implemented
the National Aeronautics R&D Policy. The National Plan establishes high priority national aero-
nautics  research  and  development  challenges,  goals  and  supporting  objectives  to  guide  the  con-
duct of U.S. aeronautics R&D activities through 2020.

• Moreover,  even  the  more  modest  programs  proposed  in  current  FAA  plans
(such  as  the  Continuous  Lower  Energy,  Emissions,  and  Noise  Program,  the
Aviation Climate Change Research Initiative, expansion of the environmental
work in the Airports Cooperative Research Program, and funding for environ-
mental  demonstration  programs  at  airports)  will  not  move  forward  unless
funds are appropriated to support them.

5. What steps should the NextGen initiative be taking to mitigate impacts?

How satisfied are you with the JPDO’s efforts to date?
I  have  reviewed  a  working  draft  of  the  environmental  section  of  the  latest  Inte-
grated Work Plan for NextGen (draft dated Aug. 12th 2008). The plans in the envi-
ronmental section are impressive—rigorous, science-based, detailed, and well coordi-
nated.  The  extent  to  which  these  will  be  effectively  integrated  with  the  overall
JPDO  work  program  is  still  to  be  determined,  but  I  commend  the  Environmental
Working  Group  of  the  JPDO  for  its  efforts.  It  has  truly  aspired  to  put  in  place  a
program that will enable an absolute reduction in aviation’s environmental impacts
notwithstanding  growth  of  the  aviation  system.  Quoting  from  the  draft  Integrated
Work Plan:

‘‘Therefore, the NextGen challenge is to reduce aviation’s environmental footprint,
even with projected aviation growth. This includes reducing the impacts of avia-
tion  noise,  and  air  quality  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  a  cost-beneficial
manner.’’

The draft Work Plan further describes their path to achieving this:

‘‘NextGen must achieve a balance between aviation’s environmental impacts and
other  societal  objectives,  both  domestically  and  internationally.  NextGen  can
meet these challenges by eliminating system-induced congestion and delay, accel-
erating  the  aircraft  technology  development/penetration  cycle  and  by  advancing
alternative fuels to manage aviation’s environmental impacts.’’

This is a useful framework for summarizing my thoughts on NextGen and JPDO.
First,  as  I  have  highlighted  several  times,  the  rational,  rigorous,  science-based  ap-
proach  adopted  by  the  FAA  to  evaluate  the  costs  and  benefits  of  various  options  is
exceptional.  Second,  the  efforts  to  eliminate  system-induced  congestion  and  delay
are sorely needed. Even today we see significant environmental impacts from these
factors.  These  impacts  will  occur  to  an  even  greater  extent  if  the  number  of  oper-
ations is increased without improving the system. The efforts to carefully assess the
full life cycle costs of alternative fuels are also very appropriate.

However,  it  is  the  area  of  accelerating  the  aircraft  technology  development/pene-
tration cycle that most concerns me. The plans and programs developed by FAA and
NASA are excellent. They are well coordinated. The national capabilities in govern-
ment,  industry  and  academia  are  excellent.  However,  the  current  funding  levels  in
this  area  are  insufficient  to  support  the  national  vision  for  absolute  reductions  in
impacts notwithstanding the projected growth.

6. The most critical issues

The two most urgent needs are:

1) To  accelerate  the  FAA–NASA  Aviation  Climate  Change  Research  Initiative.
This  will  enable  a  careful  evaluation  of  the  complex  trade-offs  among  avia-
tion’s climate impacts, and a balancing of these impacts against other objec-
tives for noise, air quality, safety, and economic performance of the industry.
2) To  significantly  increase  and  accelerate  the  focused  technology,  operations,
and alternative fuels programs in NASA and FAA that are required to effec-
tively  bridge  fundamental  aeronautics  research  and  industrial  development
programs.  This  will  have  the  single  greatest  leverage  on  our  ability  to
achieve  long-term  environmental  improvements  in  the  aviation  industry.
This can start immediately: important programs have been planned and pro-
posed by the FAA and NASA. However, they are on hold waiting FY09 fund-
ing. I encourage you to support, and indeed to expand, these programs.

Accelerating  efforts  to  address  the  environmental  impacts  of  aviation  is  the  right
thing to do for the health of the public and the planet. Commercial aviation is esti-
mated to be responsible for two to three percent of U.S. CO2 emissions, 160 or more
yearly  premature  mortalities  associated  with  poor  air  quality,  and  200,000  people
who  are  highly  annoyed  by  aircraft  noise.  While  these  impacts  are  small  relative
to the sum of human environmental impacts, they are nonetheless important. Accel-
erating  efforts  to  address  the  environmental  impacts  of  aviation  is  also  the  right

thing  to  do  for  the  economy.  The  constraints  on  the  system  are  sufficiently  strong
that  they  can  impede  realizing  the  potential  of  NextGen.  If  we  do  not  achieve  sig-
nificant advances in environmental performance there will be increasing impacts on
health  and  welfare,  and  increasing  constraints  on  the  national  air  transportation
system—with the attendant negative economic impacts that come with both.

The  priority  must  be  on  appropriating  funds  to  programs  that  address  aviation’s
environmental  impacts  starting  with  the  FY09  budget.  Thereafter,  authorization
and appropriation of funding for more significant programs are required.

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Members of this committee for this op-

portunity to address you. I will be pleased to respond to your questions.

Research Interests:
Aviation  Environmental  Portfolio  Management  Tool:  Working  with  an  international
team of researchers under FAA sponsorship to develop an aviation system envi-
ronmental-economic  model  to  better  inform  national  and  international  policy-
making.  The  model  will  enable  better  assessment  of  the  interdependencies  be-
tween aviation-related noise and emissions effects, and will provide comprehen-
sive cost analyses of aviation environmental impacts under different technology,
operations,  policy,  market  and  environmental  scenarios.  Participants  include
Georgia Institute of Technology Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory, Harvard
School of Public Health, BB&C, ICF, MVA, Vital Link Policy Analysis, MITRE,
Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, and Wyle Laboratories. (Active)
Environmental  Design  Space:  Working  with  researchers  from  the  Georgia  Institute
of Technology Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory under FAA sponsorship to
develop aircraft system-level tools for assessing tradeoffs and interdependencies
among  technological  and  operational  strategies  for  minimizing  noise,  local  air
quality and climate change impacts of aircraft. (Active)

Alternative Fuels for Aviation: Sponsored by FAA and DOD to explore the potential
to reduce aviation environmental impacts via alternative fuels while taking into
account the full life cycle of these fuels. (Active)

Impacts  of  Aircraft  Emissions  on  Air  Quality  and  Public  Health:  Working  with  re-
searchers  at  Cambridge  University,  University  of  North  Carolina,  Boise  State
University, Harvard School of Public Health, Stanford University, and the Uni-
versity of Houston under FAA and other sponsorship to perform air quality sim-
ulations  and  health  impacts  assessments  of  aviation  emissions.  The  work  in-
cludes  a  study  with  FAA  and  EPA  of  U.S.  air  quality  impacts  in  response  to
the Energy Policy Act of 2005, assessments of the impacts of low sulfur and al-
ternative  fuels,  analyses  of  the  global  effects  of  cruise  level  emissions,  and  de-
velopment of reduced order models for use in policy analyses. (Active)

ing with Aerodyne Research Incorporated under FAA, NASA and DOD sponsor-
ship  to  conduct  numerical  investigations  of  the  chemistry  and  microphysics  of
primary  pollutant  species,  short-lived  radicals,  and  particulate  matter,  down-
stream of the combustor, in the turbine, exhaust nozzle, and plume. (Active)

The  Value  of  Environmental  Technology  in  Commercial  Aviation:  Developing  prob-
abilistic  valuations  for  comparing  aviation  climate,  noise,  and  air  quality  im-
pacts  based  on  uncertain  health  and  welfare  impacts  and  technological  and
operational performance. (Active)

System  for  Assessing  Global  Aviation  Emissions:  Worked  with  researchers  from  the
MIT International Center for Air Transportation and the Volpe National Trans-
portation  Systems  Center  through  funding  from  the  FAA  to  develop  an  inter-
nationally-accepted  model  for  assessing  emissions  from  aircraft  (SAGE).  (Inac-
tive)

Operational Strategies for Contrail Mitigation: Used an aviation system model to as-
sess the costs and benefits of aircraft trajectory and routing changes as a means
to reduce contrail and aviation-induced cirrus cloudiness. (Inactive)

The  Economic  Value  of  Silence:  Worked  with  researchers  from  Cambridge  Univer-
sity on the Silent Aircraft Initiative to assess the impact of low noise technology
and  operational  procedures  on  airline  financial  performance  and  regional  eco-
nomic performance. (Inactive)

DISCUSSION

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Waitz.  I  am  very  sympa-
thetic  to  your  suggestions.  This  committee  has  tried  to  in  various
capacities authorize that R&D. It is very important to the country.
We have got to get the funding to follow up, which means we need
Presidential leadership and help in that regard.

So  at  this  point  I  am  going  to  open  up  the  first  round  of  ques-
tions. I will be recognized for five minutes and following up on that
topic  let  me  just  say  that  it  is  clear  that  all  of  you  agree  that  it
is  important  that  NextGen  be  successful,  and  I  think  it  is  impor-
tant  that  we  have  a  President  who  is  supportive,  provides  funding
and  leadership.  We  are  going  to  have  an  election  soon  and  a  new
President  here  in  just  a  few  months,  and  so  we  are  trying  to  put
together as a Committee some recommendations for the next Presi-
dent, whomever that might be, in areas of our jurisdiction.

RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT

So I would like to take a quick couple of minutes here to get your
recommendations  on  what  we  should  then  make  to  the  next  Presi-
dent concerning NextGen. Why don’t we start, well, Dr. Waitz, you
want to start with yourself?

Dr.  WAITZ.  Certainly.  I  would  be  pleased  to.  My  primary  rec-
ommendation would be to recognize that mobility and environment
are both public goods, and right now they are standing in the way
of  one  another.  And  a  small  amount  of  investment  in  the  area  re-
solving  these  problems  could  have  a  major  payoff.  So  I  think  it  is
an  excellent  area  for  us  to  invest  in  terms  of  advancing  our  sci-
entific understanding, as well as our ability to develop and advance
the Air Transportation System.

Chairman GORDON. Anyone else have any recommendations that

you would like for us to include? Yes, sir.

Dr.  DILLINGHAM.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  you  hit  the  nail  on  the
head  when  you  talked  about  having  the  President  or  the  new  Ad-
ministration  recognize  that  this  is  a  very  crucial  issue  for  the  Na-
tion in terms of the role that transportation plays both in the glob-
al economy as well as domestically. And I think it is also important
that  the  identification  and  confirmation  process  for  the  Cabinet
level as well as the FAA Administrator be high on the list, because
right  now  we  are  at  a  situation  where  there  is,  you  know,  that
leadership is very important as champions for NextGen and trans-
portation.

Chairman  GORDON.  Hopefully  that  confirmation  process  will

make that clear. Does anyone else like to—yes, sir.

Dr.  KAMINSKI.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  the  important  word  here
really  is  execution,  for  us  to  begin  to  get  on  with  the  implementa-
tion  of  this  program  and  with  the  kind  of  foundation  plan  that  I

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:09 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 044270 PO 00000 Frm 00102 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL08\091108\44270 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

have put in the statement for the record I think it is a way to actu-
ally  achieve  this,  to  get  on  with  the  program  and  to  also  build  the
personnel skills that are going to be needed for this kind of key de-
velopment. And that ought to be highlighted to an incoming Presi-
dent.

Chairman GORDON. Mr. Scovel.
Mr. SCOVEL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me, there have been
general comments. Let me highlight one specific observation for the
Committee’s consideration.

And that is keeping in mind your jurisdiction over NASA. As the
Committee  well  knows,  NASA  has  reduced  its  funding  for  JPDO
and  NextGen  and  has  chosen  to  focus  more  on  fundamental  re-
search  than  on  its  customary  role  in  the  past  of  not  only  research
but  also  developing  prototypes  which  it  could  hand  up  to  the  FAA
when they were appropriately ready.

Our  office  in  conjunction  with  the  NASA  IG  has  undertaken  a
study  of  specific  areas  where  NASA  has  made  reductions  in  fund-
ing, has cut back to fundamental research. It may well be wise for
this  committee,  if  I  may  suggest,  that  you  consider  recommending
to  the  President  that  NASA  receives  sufficient  funding  to  not  only
conduct  its  fundamental  research  but  to  bring  prototypes  to  FAA
so that NextGen can get that added boost.

Chairman  GORDON.  We  have  put  that  in  our  authorization,  un-
fortunately,  we  have  seen  across-the-board  reductions  in  aero-
nautics research.

Ms. Cox, do you want to finish up on this one?
Ms.  COX.  Yes.  Thank  you.  The  FAA  would  also  welcome  the  na-
tional  attention  and  the  focus  on  NextGen.  We  have  quite  a  few
plans  underway,  and  we  are,  as  you  can  see  from  my  testimony,
we  have  made  some  great  progress  that  we  would  like  to  see  con-
tinue.

Our budget request for ’09, and beyond represents significant in-
creases  over  past  years,  and  we  think  that  it  is  important  to  con-
tinue  to  support  the  program  in  a  carefully-aligned  and  consistent
way. And so we would ask for that. Thank you.

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you.  We  are  on  a  timeline,  so  let  me

just try to quickly get through one more question.

I have a variety of other questions, particularly for Ms. Cox that
I  am  going  to  submit  for  the  record  and  but  let  me  just  finish  up
here.

FAA REORGANIZATION

Dr.  Dillingham,  as  you  have  pointed  out,  provisions  were  in-
cluded  in  the  House-passed  FAA  Authorization  Bill  to  strengthen
the JPDO by having its director report directly to the FAA Admin-
istrator.  In  addition,  I  am  responding  to  a  request  for  the  record
from  the  Aviation  Subcommittee  Chairman  Costello  on  the  extent
to which moving JPDO out of the FAA’s air traffic organization and
how  it  would  give  the  JPDO  greater  visibility  and  authority.  GAO
stated,  and  I  quote  GAO  that,  ‘‘JPDO’s  dual  reporting  status
hinders its ability to interact on an equal footing with ATO and the
other  partner  agencies.’’  GAO  also  said,  and  I  quote,  ‘‘JPDO  must
counter  the  perception  that  it  is  a  proxy  for  the  ATO  and  as  such
is  not  able  to  act  as  an  honest  broker.’’  And  finally,  GAO  added

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:09 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 044270 PO 00000 Frm 00103 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL08\091108\44270 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

100

that  it  is  important  for  JPDO  to  have  some  independence  from
ATO,  one  exchange  that,  or  one  change  that  could,  again,  to  ad-
dress this issue would be to have the JPDO Director report directly
to the FAA Administrator.

And  Dr.  Dillingham,  after  the  FAA’s  recent  reorganization,  the
JPDO  Director  has  two  ATO  management  layers  above  him  before
he  can  reach  the  Administrator.  Are  you  concerned  that  JPDO
lacks sufficient independence from ATO as a result of this restruc-
ture? What would be the potential consequences of the lack of inde-
pendence?

And  Mr.  Scovel,  from  your  perspective  what  is  the  impact  of
FAA’s reorganization on the NextGen development implementation
effort?  And  can  you  elaborate  on  how  you  would  characterize  in
your statement as friction between the JPDO and ATO?

Dr.  DILLINGHAM.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  You  certainly  got
our words correct from the last time we talked. I guess our bottom
line on this is the jury is still out in terms of how this new govern-
ance,  new  organizational  structure  is  going  to  play  with  the  exter-
nal  stakeholders.  We,  as  you  correctly  said,  we  have  said  that  we
believe  that  a  direct  report  to  the  Administrator  was  the  best  ar-
rangement.  It  was  similar  to  what  was  in  the  House  Reauthoriza-
tion.

And  the  reason,  part  of  the  reason  we  said  that  is  because  if
JPDO  is  going  to  be  seen  by  the  partner  agencies  as  an  objective,
independent  facilitator  of  multi-agency  activities,  then  it  seems  to
be important that they are on equal footing with some of the other
parts  of  FAA  and  have  a  direct  report  that  it  doesn’t  have  to  go
through.

We,  when  we  talked  to  FAA  to  about  this,  one  of  the  concerns,
and  we  have  talked  to  Chairman  Costello  about  the  same  things
and we didn’t get the sense that the stakeholders had been allowed
to  comment  on  this,  that  it  was  more  presented  to  them  as  a  fait
accompli.  FAA  has  since  told  us  that  the  internal  stakeholders
within  FAA  are  supportive  of  this  new  arrangement,  and  we  sug-
gested  that  they  go  and  talk  to  the  external  stakeholders  and  see
if they are feeling the same way.

And, you know, I guess one of the big things and something that
you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, is when these major reorganizations
take  place,  it  seems  that  Congressional  consultation  should  be  a
part of that as well.

Chairman  GORDON.  Chairman  Costello  is  itching  to  follow  up  on

this, and he will have his chance here in just a moment.

Let  me  just,  to  be  brief,  and  as  you  said,  the  jury  is  out  on
whether this is going to be successful. I would add to that that the
burden of proof is on the FAA to determine that this change of op-
eration is successful when it is against most all the advice.

I  would  like  to  go  further,  but  I  can’t.  I  now  recognize  Mr.  Hall

for five minutes.

Mr. HALL. If Mr. Costello has a problem with staying, I will yield

some of my time to you now.

Chairman GORDON. I think his problem is sitting still in his seat.

NEXTGEN FUNDING

Mr.  HALL.  Okay.  Well,  my  first  question  will  be  to  Ms.  Cox,  and
you know, this is the time of year we go to hearing about CRs and
at  the  end  of  every  session  CRs  are  pitched  around,  and  I  guess
if  the  people,  the  voters  ever  really  realized  and  understand  what
a CR is, that they are going to empty the capital of everybody, Re-
publicans and Democrats up here that yield to the use of CRs. CRs
to  me  is  simply  saying  we  are  going  to  do  next  year  what  we  did
last  year  because  we  can’t  get  together  this  year.  And  it  narrows
right down to that.

But,  Ms.  Cox,  I  wanted  to  ask  you  if  FAA  is  funded  through  a
continuing  resolution  for  all  of  the  FY  ’09,  what  impact  would  it
have  on  NextGen  and  the  JPDO?  You  know  what  this  year  and
what last year did.

Ms.  COX.  Correct.  Our  interest  is  in  maintaining  a  continuous
funding stream for NextGen so that we can continue the plans that
we  have  in  place.  We  are  concerned  about  a  CR,  a  year-long  CR
is  particularly  concerning  in  terms  of  our  ability  to  carry  out  our
plans that we have laid for NextGen and the requirements.

We  are  sufficiently  aligned  to  make  use  of  the  funding  in  a
prompt manner as it comes on board. A concern is, as I mentioned
earlier,  we  have  a  rather  large  increase  in  our  budget  request  for
fiscal  year  ’09,  that  we  need  to  get  this  rolling.  So  the  language
around the CR will be important to us as we move forward.

Mr. HALL. And I thank you for that.
Dr.  Dillingham  or  Mr.  Scovel,  how  would  you  assess  OMB’s
record  up  to  this  time  of  coordinating  and  aligning  research  budg-
ets  among  participating  federal  agencies,  and  how  has  OMB  been
effective, if they have been effective? And a lot of times we question
their effectiveness. A lot of times.

Dr.  DILLINGHAM.  Mr.  Hall,  I  think  that  in  this  case  the  efforts
have been noteworthy. Early on because this is a multi-agency en-
terprise,  the  idea  of  working  together  and  ensuring  that  resources
that  are  aimed  for  NextGen  are,  in  fact,  considered  as  a  portfolio
in  OMB’s  consideration  I  think  is  a  step  forward  that  JPDO  and
FAA has been able to achieve. It is very hard to, or at least histori-
cally  it  has  been  very  difficult  to  marshal  cross-agency  projects,
particularly  when  you  are  talking  about  five  or  six  different  Cabi-
net-level organizations.

Mr. HALL. Thank you. And Mr. Scovel.
Mr. SCOVEL. Thank you, Mr. Hall.
Mr. HALL. Your opinion on that.
Mr. SCOVEL. Yes, if I may. Thank you. My statement, sir, speaks
to  disconnects  between  FAA  and  other  agencies  which  might  well
be  remedied  through  greater  OMB  attention  to  FAA’s  NextGen  ef-
fort. Specifically, I have mentioned earlier between FAA and NASA
and the fundamental research question. Our statement also speaks
to the disconnect between FAA and DOD and DHS on surveillance
efforts  between  FAA  and  DOD  on  Net  Centric  Operations  efforts
and  most  tellingly  I  think  and  the  clearest  example  of  all  of  this
is  between  FAA  and  the  Department  of  Commerce  and  specifically
NOAA  on  the  weather  capabilities  question,  the  so-called  4–D
Weather  Cube.  There  is  a  great  difference  between  the  budget  re-

quest  that  Department  of  Commerce  has  submitted  for  NOAA  to
coordinate  weather  and  what  FAA  on  the  other  hand  expects,  and
it  requires  some  great  attention  and  resolution  at  the  OMB  level.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE JET FUELS

Mr.  HALL.  I  thank  you  for  that.  Dr.  Waitz,  there  is  a  lot  of  talk
today about coal to liquid and a lot of questions and differences on
drilling and when we drill and why don’t we drill and all that.

You  suggest  that  aviation’s  impact  on  the  climate  might  be  re-
duced through the development of alternative jet fuels. I think such
as  coal  to  liquid.  What  other  types  of  fuels  are  under  study,  and
I  guess  more  importantly  than  that,  including  production  and  dis-
tribution, will they produce substantially less carbon than the con-
ventional  petroleum-based  fuels?  And  will  they  have  a  similar  car-
bon  footprint,  and  any  estimates  on  costs  compared  to  petroleum-
based fuels?

Dr.  WAITZ.  You  have  identified  all  of  the  right  issues.  The  pro-
duction of fuels from alternative sources is something that we know
how  to  do.  Coal  to  liquid  is  only  a  good  solution  for  the  environ-
ment  if  we  can  find  a  way  to  sequester  the  CO2 as  part  of  that,
and that is a huge grand challenge.

Mr.  HALL.  We  have  more  coal  than  any—more  usable  coal  I  am

told than any other nation in the world.

Dr.  WAITZ.  Understood.  That  tends  to  increase  the  production  of
CO2 rather  than  decrease  it  on  going  coal  to  liquid.  I  think  the
most promising things to look to are bio sources, particularly those
that do not compete with, you know, food crops and things, because
there  can  be  some  friction  between  the  two.  I  expect  that  there
would be very limited amounts of resources for doing that to make
significant  changes,  at  least  initially,  but  there  is  also  a  very
healthy  research  enterprise  that  is  looking  at  that  topic,  and  it  is
one of the, you know, things that we have to pay a lot of attention
to  because  if  we  could  solve  that  problem  and  really  produce  fuels
from  bio  sources  that  had  no  net  CO2 impact,  it  would  change  the
equation. So it is an important thing to pursue.

Mr. HALL. My time is up or I would ask you about the cost esti-

mates, but I will get back to that.

Chairman GORDON. You can submit any questions for the record,

Mr. Hall.

And really, the Congressional leader in, concerning FutureGen is,
well, FutureGen and NextGen, is Congressman Costello. Chairman
Costello, and he is recognized for five minutes.

GENERAL COMMENTS ON NEXTGEN

Mr.  COSTELLO.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you,  and  I  thank  you  for
your kind words in your opening statements, and I thank Mr. Hall
for offering to yield to me as well.

You  know,  we  could  get  into  a  lot  of  issues  here  concerning
NextGen, but we have limited time. Let me say that it is an impor-
tant project. Everyone recognizes that, all of the stakeholders. This
is a huge project for the FAA to handle. Frankly, we need to move
from a radar-based system to satellite technology that will increase

the  safety  and  efficiency  and  environmental  capacity  of  our  Air
Transport System.

But  I  have  to  tell  you,  and  I  have  said  this  at  the  T&I  Com-
mittee,  I  have  said  it  in  briefings,  I  have  said  it  in  round  tables,
I have said it in meetings with Ms. Cox and many others from the
FAA. I really question if the FAA has the capability and the capac-
ity  to  manage  a  project  of  this  magnitude.  And  I  say  that  for  the
record with Members of the Science Committee.

I  want  to  clarify  a  point  as  well,  and  Members  should  under-
stand,  I  think  Members  of  the  T&I  Committee,  certainly  the  Avia-
tion Subcommittee understand, the restructuring of how the acting
Administrator  handled  the  restructuring  of  JPDO  within  the  FAA,
I still have questions as to if it is the most efficient way to go about
and prioritize and to make NextGen a real priority within FAA.

You know, we held a number of hearings, a lot of meetings, a lot
of round-table discussions not only with the FAA but also all of the
stakeholders.  The  people  in  the  end  will  have  to  run  the  system,
the  people  in  the  end  who  will  be  affected  by  the  system  and  the
airlines, general aviation, many others. And we came up with what
I  thought  was  a  very  good  bill  in  the  H.R.  2881,  which  passed  the
Committee  unanimously,  both  Subcommittee,  Full  Committee,  and
passed through the House of Representatives.

And one of the things that we did in that bill was to elevate the
head  of  the  JPDO  and  to  have  that  person  report  directly  to  the
FAA Administrator, and we did it not based upon what we thought
was best but based upon what all of the stakeholders thought was
best,  including,  I  don’t  want  to  speak  for  Dr.  Dillingham  and  the
IG,  but  others,  with  all  of  their  input  we  felt  that  if  we  are  going
to get this major project done, that the JPDO person had to report
directly to the FAA Administrator.

Not only did that not happen, after the bill passed the House on
September  20  of  2007,  there  was  a  restructuring  within  FAA  that
we  found  out  about  by  reading  it  in  the  newspaper  as  Members  of
this  committee  did.  We  were  not  consulted,  either  the  Majority  or
the Minority in the Aviation Subcommittee or the Full Committee.
And  when  we  had  a  meeting  to  determine  why  the  FAA  would
move  in  this  direction,  which  is  contrary  to  what  the  stakeholders
told  us  was  the  best  system  to  move  to  and  what  the  will  of  the
House was by voting for H.R. 2881, we were told that they thought
internally  that  this  was  the  best  way  to  move  forward.  At  that
meeting I must tell you the head of the JPDO, who is sitting right
here in the front row, Mr. Leader, I asked him the question, I said,
were you consulted about this? You are the head of the JPDO, and
he said, no. No one talked to me about it.

So I asked Mr. Krakowski, who is now the head of the Air Traffic
Organization,  I  said,  you  didn’t  consult  with  the  head  of  JPDO  to
find out what their input would be, how it would affect them, what
they thought? No. And I said, why not? He said, because Mr. Lead-
er  was  out  of  town.  And  I  said,  so,  how  long  was  he  out  of  town,
and  he  said,  for  the  last  week.  I  asked  Mr.  Leader.  He  said  I  was
out of town for the last week. So I said, so you put all of this reor-
ganization  together  in  five  working  days?  Well,  no,  they  had  been
working on it for a few months.

And  it  is  one  of  the  problems  that  we  are  facing,  not  only  with
NextGen  but  with  a  number  of  other  problems  and  issues  within
the  FAA.  They  have  a  long  record  of  not  consulting  with  stake-
holders,  people  who  run  the  system,  people  who,  in  fact,  are  af-
fected by the system.

So I wanted to clarify that. It is not a question for Ms. Cox. She
is  not  the  person  who  made  those  decisions,  but  I  want  to  tell  you
that  I  think  it  was  a  major  mistake  the  way  that  it  was  restruc-
tured,  and  I  believe  that  if,  in  fact,  we  are  going  to  get  this  job
done, to go to a satellite-based system, that the JPDO head should
be  reporting  directly  to  the  FAA  Administrator.  I  think  all  of  the
stakeholders would tell you that. They told us that, and that is the
reason that we put it in the reauthorization bill.

I am pleased on a positive note that as Dr. Dillingham indicated
that for the longest time the FAA, they were moving forward, put-
ting NextGen together without consulting the air traffic controllers
and  others  who  in  the  end  will  have  to  run  the  system.  It  was  a
recommendation  by  I  think  Dr.  Dillingham  and  General  Scovel,  it
was  a  recommendation  certainly  of  the  Subcommittee,  and  finally,
they are now consulting with some of the stakeholders.

But  I  have  to  tell  you  that  we  have  a  lot  of  questions  about
where we go from here, questions about the agency’s ability to un-
dertake a project of this magnitude. You are talking about a project
that  the  estimates  run  all  the  way  up  to  $20,  $25  billion  to  imple-
ment between now and the year 2025. The IG back in April of this
year  said  to  the  FAA,  you  have  long-term  goals.  We  know  where
you  are  today,  we  know  where  you  want  to  be  in  2025,  but  what
are your short-term goals and give us some reports as to where we
are  today.  Give  us  a  gap  analysis,  give  us  an  interim  architecture,
and that was the IG’s recommendation.

So we had at a meeting yesterday very briefly with Ms. Cox, and
she  tells  me  that  both  the  gap  analysis  and  interim  architecture
should be done by the end of the year.

But I have major concerns about how we are headed. I think that
we  have  to  provide  very  aggressive  oversight,  both  this  committee
and  the  Aviation  Subcommittee,  in  order  to  not  only  make  certain
that  the  project  stays  on  track  but  that  we  monitor  it  in  a  proper
way  and  not  from  the  standpoint  of  is  it  on  track,  is  it  moving  to
the goal that we want to achieve. But also the cost.

This  project  has  been  going  on  for  many,  many  years,  not  only
under  this  Administration  but  previous  Administrations.  A  lot  of
time and billions of dollars have been spent on this project, and we
have very few results to show for it.

So  it  is  my  hope  that  this  Full  Committee  as  well  as  the  T&I
Committee  will  continue  to  provide  aggressive  oversight  and  to
work with the FAA on NextGen.

And with that, Mr. Chairman, I know I exceeded my time. Thank

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Costello.  I  certainly  concur

with you. And Dr. Gingrey is recognized.

Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I will address my ques-

you.

tion to Ms. Cox.

In  your  written  testimony  you  raise  I  think  two  very  interesting
points, and I would like to explore those with the Committee. First,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:09 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 044270 PO 00000 Frm 00108 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL08\091108\44270 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

105

you  testified  that  NextGen  is  not  simply  about  air  traffic  capabili-
ties  but  also  about  fostering  improvements  in  ground  infrastruc-
ture,  aircraft  technologies,  and  most  importantly  I  think,  alter-
native  fuels.  And  then  later  on  you  note  that  the  airline  industry
sees  about  40  percent  of  its  overall  costs  spent  on  fuel.  Maybe  it
is  more  than  that  now,  growing  all  the  time,  and  the  FAA,  of
course,  has  taken  a  very  active  role  in  Commercial  Aviation  Alter-
native Fuels Initiative, which includes testing on both coal to liquid
fuels and gas to liquid fuels.

Our  Ranking  Member  Hall,  of  course,  discussed  that  a  little  bit
with  Dr.  Waitz  in  regard  to  coal  to  liquid  technology.  And  saying
that, I find it troubling that this Congress seems to handcuff these
efforts with a section in the Energy Independence and Security Act
of  2007,  which  was  passed  last  year,  and  I  am  referencing,  Ms.
Cox, Section 526. I am sure you are familiar with that section, but
it explicitly prevents the Federal Government, any agency actually,
any  agency  of  the  Federal  Government,  including,  Dr.  Waitz,  the
Department  of  Defense  and  within  the  Department  of  Defense  the
United States Air Force, which is using most of the fuel in our air
fleet.

But this section prevents any agency of the Federal Government
from  contracting  for  the  purchase  of  any  alternative  fuel  if  it  re-
sults  in  one  scintilla  increase  in  the  carbon  dioxide  footprint.  Dr.
Waitz has great concerns about that, and it seems to me in his tes-
timony to be sympathetic with maybe the EU’s approach to climate
change and the Kyoto Protocol and that sort of approach.

It  seems  to  me  that  that  kind  of  policy  is  misguided  especially
when  we  are  on  a  time  of  great  dependency,  great  dependency  on
other  countries  for  our  fuel.  And  that  it,  indeed  would  stymie  the
efforts of the FAA in undertaking with NextGen and developing al-
ternative fuels. And so to that end let me ask you two specific ques-
tions.  First,  because  of  these  high  fuels  costs  can  you  provide  the
Committee  with  the  progress  of  testing  coal  to  liquid  fuels  within
its role in NextGen?

And  the  second  question  I  have  for  you  is  this.  Please  answer
this  one  yes  or  no  if  you  will.  If  the  Federal  Government  is  sup-
posed  to  take  the  lead  on  alternative  fuels,  then  isn’t  Section  526
of  the  Energy  Independence  and  Security  Act  of  2007,  a  roadblock
to innovation for NextGen? And if there is time remaining, I would
like to ask maybe Dr. Waitz to comment on that as well.

Ms. COX. Thank you for the question. In terms of progress in al-
ternative  fuels,  the  FAA  continues  its  investment  in  the  program
through  the  CAAFI  work  that  we  are  doing  that  Dr.  Waitz  ref-
erenced.  I  would  defer  to  his  superior  knowledge  on  the  progress
of  testing  in  the  coal  to  liquid  fuels.  I  am  not  an  expert  in  that
area, and I know that Dr. Waitz is the expert in that area.

We remain committed to finding an alternative fuel that does re-
duce  the  carbon  footprint,  and  to  that  end  we  have  increased  our
investment  overall  in  the  environment  with  our  R&D  budget  by  a
great  deal  between  ’08,  and  ’09.  Over  our  environmental  invest-
ment  has  gone  up  135  percent,  and  of  the  total  R&D  budget  our
investment  in  the  environment  is  a  full,  a  little  over  10  percent  of
our entire R&D budget, which this committee is very familiar with.

106

So  we  remain  committed  to—and  we  are  encouraged  by  the
progress  that  is  being  made,  and  in  fact,  we  think  that  526  sets  a
bar that we probably need to meet in terms of carbon dioxide. But,
again, I defer to——

Mr.  GINGREY.  Well,  let  me  just  say  this,  and  I  know  my  time  is
limited  and  maybe  won’t  get  back  to  Dr.  Waitz  and  maybe  we  can
in a second round. But when you tell the agency, the Federal Gov-
ernment,  particularly  the  Department  of  Defense  that  don’t  bother
to  contract  for  any  alternative  fuels  other  than  conventional  bub-
ble-up petroleum jet fuel, that they are not going to be able to use
it,  so  that  certainly  puts  a  damper  on  their  enthusiasm  for  con-
ducting the research on things like coal to liquid, carbon sequestra-
tion as Dr. Waitz said. That is the very research that we are trying
to do within NASA and Department of Defense. And it is just coun-
terproductive.

So  I  see  my  time  has  expired,  Mr.  Chairman.  I,  maybe  I  will

have some time in the second round.

Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Dr. Gingrey. I do have some good
news for you. In that same act that you pointed out, this committee
put  in  that  Energy  Bill  an  extensive  program  on  carbon  capture
and  sequestration,  which  is  the  basis  for  any  type  of  coal  to  liquid
or anything else as Dr. Waitz pointed out.

So the first step is being taken. You can’t do the second until you
get  the  carbon  sequestration.  This  Committee  played  a  big  role  in
that program.

Ms. Edwards, you are recognized.
Ms. EDWARDS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

NEXTGEN BUDGET AND EDUCATION ISSUES

Dr. Kaminski, in your testimony you advocated securing systems
acquisition,  systems  engineering,  and  integrated  management  tal-
ent  at  FAA  and  other  agencies  as  part  of  accelerating  NextGen.
And  so  I  am  really  curious  given  today’s  competitive  environment,
competing needs at other agencies, what you think the FAA can do
to  distinguish  itself  and  particularly  looking,  and  then  to  Ms.  Cox,
looking at the budget allocations for projections for the current fis-
cal  year  and  the  out  years,  a  doubling  and  then  a  tripling  of  the
budget for NextGen and what the plans really are within the FAA
to be able to both acquire the talent in house that it needs to over-
see  this  kind  of  project,  and  you  know,  where  the  plans  might  be,
particularly  Dr.  Kaminski,  for  reaching  that  kind  of  talent,  given
the competition from other agencies and even in the private sector.
Dr.  KAMINSKI.  That  is  a  very  good  and  important  question,  and
when  we  look  at  the  funding  that  the  country  is  going  spend  for
this  program  over  a  20-year  period,  my  estimate  would  be  some-
thing  approaching  $100  billion  when  we  start  to  look  at  all  of  our
equipage  issues,  including  the  private  sector  investments  that  will
be made in a corresponding way.

So this is a big deal. This is a big and important and large, com-
plicated  program.  And  to  get  to  your  question  to  training  the  peo-
ple, what I proposed in the briefing that I submitted for the record,
is an approach that involves building a little, testing a little, devel-
oping, modeling, and simulation tools to be able to predict how this
system will work.

107

Those are going to be a very important foundation for us to have
as we look at new capabilities over time. We also have the problem
of  what  I  would  describe  as  changing  the  tire  on  the  car  that  is
going 60 miles an hour, because we are going to have to implement
these  improvements  as  we  are  moving  along,  having  modeling  and
simulation that we validated by demonstrations is going to be very
critical for us to be able to do that.

The modeling and simulation and the demonstrations that I pro-
pose also are a superb training ground for people to gain some do-
main experience in what is going on. Education is required, but do-
main experience is also required in this process.

So  it  is  going  to  be  very  important  for  us  to  build  that  base.  I
do not believe that entire base is present today at the FAA. I think
the FAA is planning to try to build that base, but it will be a chal-
lenge.

And  then  to  your  last  question,  one  of  the  incentives  to  attract
people  to  this  kind  of  activity,  I  don’t  believe  they  are  only  going
to  be  financial  incentives.  In  my  experience  in  the  DOD  what  I
have found is that it is possible to attract best and brightest people
to  government  and  to  industry  and  this  kind  of  activity,  but  keep-
ing  them  depends  upon  providing  them  with  real  challenges,  pro-
viding  them  with  the  tools  to  address  those  challenges,  and  most
importantly  allowing  them  to  see  that  they  can  make  a  difference,
that they can change the world, they can change the infrastructure
of  our  country  in  important  ways.  That  is  the  fundamental  attrac-
tor.

Ms.  EDWARDS.  Well,  it  certainly  has  to  be  interesting  work,  and
then Ms. Cox, can you address the budget concerns? Because I am
just, I think that kind of growth is really significant, and I am not
really sure what you have in house to manage that kind of growth.
Ms. COX. Yeah. Thank you for the question. It is a very good one.
In response to the systems engineering issue, I can say that we are
growing some of that talent in house. Fifty-seven employees in the
air  traffic  organization  have  received  certificates  in  graduate  sys-
tems  engineering  disciplines,  and  we  have  60  employees  who  are
currently  enrolled  in  certificate  programs  in  systems  engineering.
So we gain some in that way.

We are concerned about systems engineering and other technical
skills  such  as  information  technology  specialists,  automation  spe-
cialists that we will need going forward to support the level of work
that  you  point  out  that  we  have.  We  have  hired  within  the
NextGen  and  operations  planning  organization  over  the  past  year
78 new employees, most of whom came from outside the FAA. One
way  we  attract  people  is  as  Dr.  Kaminski  has  pointed  out  through
the very, this is a very exciting program. This is a real opportunity
to  make  a  difference,  and  I  think  that  is  very  attractive  to  folks,
especially  recent  graduates  just  entering  the  workplace,  and  that
is a group that we do want to attract.

We  believe  that  we  are  going  to  need  to  hire  on  the  level  of  300
more  in-house  professionals  in  addition  to  the  assistance  that  we
can get through external sources such as federally funded research
and  development  corporations  and  other  external  opportunities  to
bring people on board.

And  we  are  working  closely  with  our  human  resources  organiza-
tion to be sure that they have the resources on hand to help us re-
cruit  and  bring  in  those  people.  And  as  Dr.  Kaminski  points  out,
the methods to retain the people once we get them.

Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Ms. Edwards and Ms. Cox.
Dr. Ehlers, you are recognized.
Mr. EHLERS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think I have spent en-
tirely  too  much  time  with  some  of  you  in  the  past  two  days,  but
I enjoyed it.

FAA HIRING

Ms. Cox, continuing with some of this discussion, I voiced yester-
day  in  one  of  the  two  meetings  we  had  my  concern  about  NASA
involvement  and  that  they  don’t  seem  to  have  the  funding  or  the
personnel  to  do  it.  Now,  you  are  taking  on  more  and  greater  re-
search  and  development  responsibilities  as  a  result,  aren’t  you,  in
the  FAA?  And  your  last  comment  about  the  number  of  people  you
are  adding,  is  that  to  fill  that  gap?  Is  it  specifically  directed  to
what  NASA  might  ordinarily  have  done,  or  are  there  other  factors
here as well?

And  I  am  also  wondering  if  you  have  the  flexibility  you  need  to
do  the  hiring?  I  know  how  convoluted  hiring  practices  can  become
in the Federal Government. Obviously you need these people fairly
quickly, and I am wondering if you are having any difficulties with
that and whether you will be able to find the mix of skills that you
need in the time that you need them.

Would you just give me some idea on that?
Ms.  COX.  Well,  as  we  pointed  out,  we  do  need  people  to  help  us
manage the work that the budget request reflects that we will need
to  be  doing  to  achieve  NextGen.  So  the  hiring  is  around  that,  and
that includes the additional R&D work that we anticipate doing to
support  NextGen.  We  have  been  working  closely  with  the  human
resources  organization  at  the  FAA  to  address  this  issue  of  the  dif-
ficulty of bringing people on board.

We  had  pretty  good  success.  Seventy-eight  people  in  just  our  or-
ganization  in  the  course  of  a  year,  most  of  them  coming  from  out-
side, is a pretty good record for the Federal Government in hiring.
The  FAA,  as  you  know,  has  some  flexibilities  in  that  area  that  we
are looking at how to utilize and take best advantage of.

I am not sure that we have always taken best advantage of those
efforts  in  the  past,  but  we  are  looking  at,  we  have  lots  of  room  for
innovation and moving ahead. So we hope to do that.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Well,  if  I  lose  my  election,  I  may  be  applying  as

well.

GAP ANALYSIS FINDINGS

Also, the gap analysis that you mentioned. You stated that JPDO
completed a gap analysis. Could you expand just a little bit on the
findings?  What  areas  need  focus,  how  will  you  handle  it,  how  will
the partner agencies handle it?

Just if you can give me sort of an overall picture of what the gap

analysis revealed and how you are going to handle it.

Ms. COX. Well, the gap analysis was an effort by the Joint Plan-
ning  and  Development  Office,  and  they  work  closely  with  MITRE
to assess what was in the Integrated Work Plan and what is in the
plans  of  the  partner  agencies  of  JPDO.  They  found  seven  critical
areas  that  they  believe  require  additional  focus.  Those  include  the
environment,  and  we  have  had  quite  a  bit  of  conversation  about
those issues today. Security risk management is another area. Vali-
dation and verification of complex systems. You know, we are intro-
ducing  something  kind  of  new  and  different  with  this,  and  it  is  a
very  complex  undertaking.  Validation  and  verification  of  what  we
are  doing  is  going  to  be  extremely  important.  Then  they  looked  at
some air traffic issues that go to kind of specific areas.

One  is  closely  spaced  parallel  runways.  Ten  of  the  35  OEP  air-
ports  have  closely-spaced  parallel  runways,  and  we  need  to  get
greater  capacity  out  of  those.  So  that  was  another  key  area  that
they identified.

How to integrate arrival and departure traffic with surface traffic
was  another  area  that  they  identified,  and  also  this  issue  of  air  to
ground  functional  allocation.  What  is  the  role  of  the  pilot,  what  is
the role of the controller in the NextGen environment? That needs
more  work  to  be  addressed,  particularly  with  the  human  factors
issues that are involved with that.

And  finally,  the  JPDO  or  the  NextGen  Enterprise  Architecture,
the  Enterprise  Architecture  that  rolls  up  the  work  of  all  the  indi-
vidual partner agencies into a single architecture for NextGen, the
validation  of  that  and  developing  a  business  case  around  that  was
another issue.

Obviously,  the  air  traffic  issues  fall  under  the  province  of  the
FAA and NASA in terms of some of those it required the, some re-
search  and  development  to  move  us  forward.  DHS  with  security
risk  management  and  the  JPDO  with  the  Enterprise  architecture
issue.

Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Ms. Cox, and——
Mr. EHLERS. May I just make a comment?
Chairman GORDON. Okay. Yes.
Mr. EHLERS. I just want to say I have been very, very concerned
about  the  entire  NextGen  Project,  and  I  wasn’t  sure  that  we  were
going  to,  that  you  and  we  were  going  to  be  able  to  pull  it  off  in  a
timely  fashion  at  a  reasonable  cost.  I  must  say  I  am  pleased  with
the progress made, and I am starting to feel much better about the
project  now,  and  I  am  addressing  that  not  just  to  Ms.  Cox  but  to
all of you.

I  think  you  are  making  substantial  progress  in  the  right  direc-
tion.  I  still  have  a  lot  of  concerns  but  I  would  be  crazy  if  I  didn’t
have concerns about a project of this magnitude.

Thank you for the work that you are doing.
Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Dr. Ehlers. You know, there has
been a lot of discussion about costs, so I think it is appropriate that
we  talk  to  an  appropriator  here  and  so  Mr.  Rothman,  let  me  just
say,  again,  there  is  a  9/11  memorial  getting  ready  to  start,  and  so
Mr. Rothman will be our last witness. Our other—our last Member
to ask questions. Any other Members that have questions they can
be submitted for the record.

Mr. ROTHMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding
this  very  important  hearing.  I  want  to,  I  am  speaking  quickly.  I
have five minutes. I want to acknowledge and express my apprecia-
tion  to  the  panel  for  their  expertise  and  for  their  service  to  our
country. You have distinguished careers, each and every one of you.
I  want  to  say  a  couple  of  things  real  fast.  It  was  noted  that  air
traffic  controllers  are  being  a  part  of  the  NextGen,  and  that  is  a
great  thing.  Please  keep  that  up.  If  there,  in  fact,  is  a  need  for
more  input  from  safety  technicians,  I  hope  the  people  responsible
will address that.

I  also  would  hope  that  citizens  groups  who  are  involved  in  qual-
ity  of  life  issues  and  noise  in  particular,  but  also  emissions  over
their  homes  and  their  barbecue  grills  will  also  be  consulted  as
NextGen is developed.

One  other  pet  peeve,  wondering  why  small  trainers  or  propeller
planes  are  still  permitted  to  fly  over  densely-crowded  populated
areas.  I  don’t  think  we  are  allowed  to  bring  horses  and  buggies
into, through tunnels and bridges into the major density populated
areas  of  a  country.  So  I  don’t  think—I  think  these  trainers  and
small  prop  planes  should  be  prohibited  from  flying  over  densely-
populated areas.

So  I  hope  that  those  who  will  have  jurisdiction  over  that  area

will address it.

OVERCROWDING OF THE SKIES

But  here  is  the  point  I  or  the  question  I  want  you,  the  panel,  to
consider.  I  would  like  to  hear  first  from  Dr.  Waitz,  but  I  would  be
interested  in  everyone’s  views  assuming  there  is  time.  And  I  am
very  grateful  that  you  are  working  on  noise  issues  and  emissions
issue.  It  is  really  important,  and  as  Dr.  Waitz  said,  that  is  a  lim-
iting  factor  on  expansion  of  airports  but  beyond  that  it  has  to  do
with  the  lives  of  five  million  people,  and  I  think  that  number  is
rather low.

So thank you, keep that up, and I will be paying attention.
Let  us  assume  that  we  make  a  quiet  airplane,  perfectly  silent,
and  God  willing  that  will  happen  some  day.  How  do  we  feel  about
the  sky  over  our  head  being  filled  with  aircraft?  You  know  those
pictures of World War II, the bombing of Dresden and the sky filled
with aircraft. Now, granted, I understand that the effort is to have
the  planes  fly  higher  and  so  all  of  that,  but  let  us  reduce  it  to  the
extreme  or  the  absurd  if  you  will.  To  find  out  the  nature  of  your
thinking, do we want a society or a world where our skies are com-
pletely  filled  with  aircraft,  even  if  they  are  silent  and  there  is  no
dangerous emissions coming from them?

Dr.  WAITZ.  I  remember  the  first  airplane  my  dad  bought  me
when  I  was  four.  So  you  are  asking  the  wrong  person.  Blue  with
yellow  wings.  I  look  up  every  time  I  see  one.  I  think  it  is  just  an
important  part  of  providing,  you  know,  goods  and  services  and
movement  of  people.  And  the  sky  is  not  so  filled  with  airplanes
when you look at how much sky there is.

Mr. ROTHMAN. Where do you live, Dr. Waitz?
Dr. WAITZ. I live in Boston. Yeah. So, no, my feeling is that, you
know,  airplanes  are  an  important  part  of  our  modern  life,  and  I
value them.

Mr. ROTHMAN. Anyone else have any comments?
Dr.  DILLINGHAM.  Mr.  Rothman,  I  think  that  there  is  a  recogni-
tion of the concern about a situation that you described, and to ad-
dress that there is also initiatives or thinking about an intermodal
approach to transportation. So, you know, your concerns are widely
shared, and there is, there are efforts about to do something about
them.

Mr. ROTHMAN. Great. I just can say that there will be resistance

to filling the sky with planes.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Rothman. Although Mr. Hall
wanted  me  to  point  out  that  in  Texas  you  can  bring  horses  and
buggies  in  on  the  roads  and  into  the  bridges,  again,  thanks  to  our
witnesses.  I  am  sorry  we  had  to  be  somewhat  abbreviated  today.
I know I have some and I think other Members will have some ad-
ditional  questions  for  you,  and  I  would  like  to  now  pass  the  gavel
to Mr. Hall to adjourn us for this session of Congress.

We are adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:35 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Victoria  Cox,  Senior  Vice  President  for  NextGen  and  Operations  Plan-

ning, Air Traffic Organization, Federal Aviation Administration

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. Automatic  Dependent  Surveillance  Broadcast  (ADS–B)  is  intended  to  be  a  cor-
nerstone of the NextGen system. However, I understand that FAA received strong
criticism  in  response  to  its  proposed  ADS–B  rule-making  for  user  equipage.
Users expressed concern that mandating equipment on board aircraft would pro-
vide only the ADS–B ‘‘out’’ service, where signals transmitted would be used pri-
marily  by  the  air  traffic  control  system  to  get  new  data  on  aircraft  positions.
Some  operators  viewed  the  mandated  ADS–B  ‘‘out’’  equipage  as  providing  them
with little or not benefit, either operationally or financially. While FAA no doubt
will  benefit  from  ADS–B,  push  back  from  the  intended  users  shows  that  they
have yet to be persuaded.

Q1a. What  commitments,  such  as  a  reduction  in  delays  or  lower  fuel  consumption,
could  FAA  make  to  convince  users  of  the  positive  benefits  of  equipping  with
ADS–B ‘‘out’’?

A1a. The following table summarizes the benefits for the Air Transport community
(note: ADS–B ‘Out’ benefits are highlighted in yellow, ADS–B ‘In’ benefits are high-
lighted in green, and both ‘In’/‘Out’ benefits are highlighted in orange):

The  following  table  summarizes  the  benefits  for  the  General  Aviation  community
(note: ADS–B ‘Out’ benefits are highlighted in yellow, ADS–B ‘In’ benefits are high-
lighted in green, and both ‘In’/‘Out’ benefits are highlighted in orange):

115

Reduction in delays or lower fuel consumption:

United Parcel Service (UPS) has been an early adopter of ADS–B technology; they
have  equipped  some  of  their  aircraft  and  have  seen  both  increased  efficiency  and
lower fuel burn in their operations. For example, they have seen a 30 percent reduc-
tion  in  noise,  a  34  percent  reduction  in  nitrous  oxide  emissions  and  250  to  465
pounds less fuel burn per flight.

Additionally, the agency is working to develop performance routes in the National
Airspace System (NAS) for ADS–B equipped aircraft. This would enable direct rout-
ing  which  translates  into  increased  efficiency  for  the  airline/aircraft  operations.  By
providing these routes it would also lower fuel burn since the aircraft would be fly-
ing at optimal altitudes and optimal routes.
Q1b. When will ADS–B ‘‘in’’ become available, especially given its potential for help-

ing prevent runway incursions?

A1b. ADS–B  is  available  today  and  the  FAA  is  encouraging  users  to  equip  by  pro-
viding  ADS–B  in  applications  such  as  advisory  services.  The  FAA  is  currently  pro-
viding Traffic Information Service—Broadcast (TIS–B) and Flight Information Serv-
ice—Broadcast (FIS–B) to ADS–B equipped aircraft in Southern Florida. TIS–B will
show  pilots  the  same  display  of  air  traffic  that  controllers  see.  The  FIS–B  products
will  provide  graphical  displays  of  National  Weather  Service  products  and  essential
flight  information,  such  as  special-use  airspace  and  temporary  flight  restrictions.
TIS–B and FIS–B are a part of the service that supports ADS–B ‘In.’

As  a  part  of  segment  one  deployment  the  FAA  will  be  providing  these  services
(TIS–B  and  FIS–B)  along  the  east  and  west  coasts,  and  portions  of  the  mid-west
by 2010. As for segment two, the plans are to provide the same services everywhere
there is radar coverage today by 2013.
Q1c. What  specifically  is  FAA  doing  to  accelerate  transition  to  early  equipage  of

ADS–B? When could we see the job completed?

A1c. The  FAA  has  been  working  with  Industry  through  the  ADS–B  Aviation  Rule-
making  Committee  (ARC)  to  accelerate  early  equipage  of  ADS–B.  Specifically,  two
of the ARC recommendations focus on benefits/equipage:

• Recommendation  #9:  Leverage  the  benefits  of  ADS–B 
information  to
• Recommendation  #10:  Continue  to  establish  agreements  with  local  and  State

incentivize equipage by establishing agreements with specific operators.

governments to leverage the benefits of ADS–B

Since  that  time,  the  FAA  has  held  the  following  meetings  to  determine  potential

incentive mechanisms to include in potential agreements:
• January 2008: NetJets, American Airlines, FedEx
• April 2008: Continental Airlines, DayJet, Wisconsin Department of Transpor-
• May 2008: DayJet Follow-up
• June  2008:  Follow-up  with  American  Airlines,  California  Department  of

tation, Minnesota Department of Transportation

• July 2008: Additional Follow-up with American Airlines, United Airlines
• October 2008: USAirways

The  following  table  incorporates  the  feedback  from  these  meetings  to  show  what

may incentivize users to equip early.

Q2. The  terrible  events  of  September  11,  2001  remind  us  of  the  potential  con-
sequences of the malicious misuse of the Nation’s aviation system. As you know,
by using ADS–B, NextGen will be able to monitor the precise location of aircraft
in the national airspace, but only if those aircraft cooperate and emit the needed
signal.

Q2a. In  the  NextGen  era,  will  there  be  a  continuing  need  for  DOD  and  DHS  to
maintain  radar  surveillance  to  guard  against  a  situation  where  a  terrorist-op-
erated aircraft does not transmit ADS–B signals so that it can fly unobserved?
A2a. The  surveillance  requirements  for  the  national  air  transportation  system  are
continuing  to  evolve.  While  ADS–B  will  offer  considerable  benefits  in  terms  of  sys-
tem  operations  there  are  additional  security  and  national  defense  concerns  that  re-
quire  consideration.  The  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  and  the  Depart-
ment  of  Defense  (DOD)  have  both  expressed  the  need  for  continued  primary,  non-
cooperative radar capabilities.
Q2b. If so, have the FAA and other agencies determined how that radar surveillance

capability will be provided? How will it be provided?

A2b. Successfully  addressing  this  issue  requires  a  multi-agency  perspective.  In  its
cross-agency  coordination  role  NextGen’s  Joint  Planning  and  Development  Office
(JPDO)  has  established  a  joint  Interagency  Surveillance  Study  Team  (ISST)  with
the DOD, the DHS, the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Admin-
istration, and the Department of Commerce to address the issue.
Q2c. What requirements are DOD and DHS levying on the NextGen system for radar

surveillance?

A2c. The  ISST  has  recommended  the  establishment  of  a  formal  and  institutional-
ized  mechanism  for  the  management  and  ownership  of  the  Nation’s  integrated  sur-
veillance  capabilities.  Under  this  approach  future  national  aviation  surveillance  in-
formation  requirements  can  be  analyzed  holistically.  This  comprehensive  approach
will  ensure  that  the  responsibilities  and  requirements  of  key  stakeholders  are  ad-
dressed.

These  proposals  have  been  presented  to  the  JPDO’s  Board  of  Directors  and  will

shortly be considered by the NextGen Senior Policy Council.

Q3. A few weeks ago, an internal software processing error in FAA’s NADIN system
grounded  hundreds  of  flights.  Evidently  an  aging  back  up  system  got  over-
whelmed and hundreds of planes could not get off the ground. In drafting H.R.
2698—legislation  authorizing  FAA’s  R&D—this  committee  explicitly  singled  out
the  need  for  contingency  plans  in  designing  NextGen.  Specifically,  the  Director
of  JPDO  was  directed  to  develop  contingency  plans  for  dealing  with  the  deg-
radation of the air traffic control system in the event of a natural disaster, major
equipment failure, or act of terrorism.
In developing NextGen, which is a system of systems, how is the need for redun-
dancy and backup capability being addressed?

A3. Business Continuity is a fundamental requirement in NextGen. The limitations
imposed  on  our  systems,  such  as  computer  processing,  communications  over  copper
phone  lines,  and  old  protocols  for  exchange  of  information,  are  being  removed.  Air
traffic  management,  communications,  navigation,  surveillance  services  are  provided
in  a  more  seamless,  flexible  fashion  than  today.  Network  enabled  services  will  pro-
vide  greater  system  resilience,  and  the  opportunity  to  handle  demand  more  effec-
tively.  The  flexibility  these  systems  provide  for  reliability  and  backup  also  provide
the flexibility to better manage weather events and other perturbations to the NAS
that cause delays and reduce service levels.

The  NextGen  transformational  programs  especially  System  Wide  Information
Management  and  NAS  Voice  Switch,  along  with  FTI,  provide  much  of  the  infra-
structure needed to move networked enabled services forward. These systems enable
the  information  sharing  between  facilities  that  is  an  essential  element  of  NextGen:
dramatically  improving  situational  awareness,  maximizing  collaborative  planning,
and  minimizing  the  impacts  of  weather  and  system  outage  on  capacity.  Air  traffic
services will no longer be directly tied to a legacy, static information infrastructure.
Q4. How is budgetary and program accountability assigned in the new ATO restruc-
turing?  In  other  words,  who  has  control  over  the  budget  of  an  acquisition  such
as ADS–B or SWIM that will be critical to the success of the NextGen initiative?
Who is in charge of those programs?

A4. The Sr. Vice President for NextGen and Operations Planning has responsibility
for  all  elements  of  the  NextGen  portfolio,  including  the  transformational  programs
(i.e.,  ADS–B,  SWIM,  NNEW,  Datacomm,  and  NVS).  The  NextGen  Integration  and
Implementation  (I&I)  Office,  reporting  to  the  Sr.  Vice  President  for  NextGen  and
Operations Planning, is responsible for developing and managing the FAA NextGen
Implementation  Plan,  and  the  budget  that  supports  it.  Individual  NextGen  pro-
grams such as ADS–B and SWIM are assigned to program offices as part of the in-
vestment decision. The individual program offices retain the responsibility for meet-
ing  program  expectations  and  for  managing  their  programs  in  accordance  with
timelines and milestones established with the I&I Office and the FAA’s Acquisition
Management System. The Senior Vice President for NextGen and Operations Plan-
ning  is  responsible  for  overall  management  and  alignment  of  all  NextGen  projects.
Q5. The  DOT  OIG  recommended  earlier  this  year  that  FAA  develop  an  interim  ar-
chitecture or ‘‘way-point’’ that is manageable and executable for what is expected
in 2015. The OIG report says that FAA concurred with this recommendation.

Q5a. When will such an interim architecture be completed?
A5a. The  FAA  concurs  with  the  recommendation  to  develop  an  interim  National
Airspace  System  (NAS)  architecture  that  defines  a  way-point  on  the  path  to  real-
izing  NextGen  and  the  ‘‘To  Be’’  enterprise  architecture.  The  development  of  an  in-
terim architecture and the associated requirements will provide a mid-term goal for
the implementation of key NextGen capabilities that reduces far-term schedule risk.
The  annual  update  of  the  FAA’s  NAS  Enterprise  Architecture  Roadmaps  will  be
published in January 2009. These architectural updates will be reflected in the next
version of the FAA’s NextGen Implementation Plan, which is also scheduled for re-
lease  in  January  2009.  These  documents  outline  the  FAA’s  activities  for  imple-
menting near-term and mid-term NextGen capabilities into the NAS.

As  part  of  this  year’s  roadmap  updates,  several  new  activities  and  features  are
being  incorporated  to  enhance  the  usability  and  effectiveness  of  the  roadmaps  and
to support the definition of the mid-term architecture.

First, we worked with the JPDO to ensure alignment of the Operational Improve-
ments between the JPDO’s planning documents and the FAA’s Enterprise Architec-
ture.  Each  of  the  Operational  Improvements  were  then  mapped  to  functions  and
projects by phase: near-, mid-, and far-term. The results of this mapping activity are
being transferred to the roadmaps as part of this year’s update process. This align-

ment  work  will  allow  a  more  precise  definition  of  the  mid-term  architecture,  capa-
bilities  and  functions,  and  the  associated  projects  necessary  to  realize  the  NextGen
benefits including the critical capabilities to be realized in the mid-term.

Second, we initiated efforts to integrate key supporting activities such as research
and  development,  prototypes  and  demonstrations,  international  initiatives,  and
other  activities  into  the  EA  roadmaps.  This  will  provide  greater  insight  into  sched-
ule  dependencies,  policy  issues,  transition  readiness  criteria  and  associated  risks,
and  identify  any  gaps  between  these  supporting  activities  and  Agency  projects  and
programs that need to be addressed to reduce implementation risk for NextGen. We
are also ensuring that we fully capture all legacy systems in the EA so that we can
properly identify convergence strategies as we migrate from the current portfolio of
systems to NextGen.

Third,  new  roadmaps  are  being  developed  to  provide  greater  visibility  into  key
areas of the NextGen mid-term architecture such as airspace design and procedures,
service  oriented  architecture,  network-centricity  and  inter-operability,  as  well  as  to
identify  impacts  on  personnel,  security,  and  safety.  These  new  architecture  ‘‘views’’
will  be  aligned  with  existing  EA  products  to  provide  a  more  complete  definition  of
the mid-term architecture.

These  initiatives  taken  together  will  provide  the  basis  for  a  complete  definition
of  the  mid-term  architecture  and  enhanced  insight  into  the  evolution  of  NAS
changes necessary to realize NextGen.
Q5b. How will it affect the long-term NextGen implementation schedule?
A5b. A  more  complete  definition  of  the  mid-term  architecture  based  on  the  initia-
tives described in the previous response will enhance our ability to accomplish long-
term  objectives.  Therefore,  it  will  positively  affect  the  long-term  plans  for  NextGen
and reduce far-term schedule and implementation risk.

As  previously  mentioned,  we  worked  this  year  to  align  the  Operational  Improve-
ments between the JPDO’s planning documents and the FAA’s NAS Enterprise Ar-
chitecture. Early next year, we have plans to continue this effort by focusing on the
far-term Operational Improvements and the associated research activities needed to
reduce  far-term  schedule  risk.  We  will  continue  the  efforts  initiated  this  year  to
align  R&D  activities  within  the  EA  roadmaps  and  look  for  gaps  and  opportunities
to more closely align R&D with project acquisition strategies.

In addition, we have plans over the next several months to supplement the exist-
ing enterprise architecture with new views that will provide greater insight into the
‘‘To Be’’ architecture. These views will provide additional information and detail into
important  aspects  of  the  architecture  needed  to  reduce  long-term  implementation
and schedule risk.
Q5c. Are  you  still  committed  to  the  release  of  an  updated  Integrated  Work  Plan  by

the end of September 2008?

A5c. This  action  is  complete.  The  Joint  Planning  and  Development  Office  (JPDO)
released  The  Next  Generation  Air  Transportation  System  Integrated  Work  Plan:  A
Functional  Outline  (Version  1.0)  in  September  2008  as  planned.  The  Integrated
Work Plan (IWP) provides a tool to support the collaborative planning and delibera-
tion needed among partners and stakeholders to prioritize needs, establish commit-
ments,  coordinate  efforts,  and  focus  resources  on  the  work  needed  to  achieve  the
Next  Generation  Air  Transportation  System  (NextGen).  The  IWP  is  a  functional
plan  that  outlines  the  proposed  building  blocks  towards  achieving  the  NextGen  vi-
sion. NextGen will be realized through the research, development, and implementa-
tion  investments  that  are  funded  and  managed  by  each  NextGen  Partner.  The
JPDO  works  with  all  NextGen  Partners  to  align  their  investments  towards  achiev-
ing the overall NextGen vision. IWP Version 1.0 conveys the JPDO’s current under-
standing  of  Partner  efforts  and  presents  the  suggested  alignment  of  NextGen  plan-
ning  elements  with  each  Partner’s  mission  areas.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the
IWP is an unconstrained plan and does not seek to define prescriptive implementa-
tion  activities,  nor  does  it  address  priorities  of  activities  at  this  time.  It  proposes
a  path  to  realize  the  IWP  elements  but  not  the  specific  program  steps,  resources
or  implementation  elements  such  as  facility  roll-out,  training,  or  decommissioning.
The  detailed  planning  for  each  IWP  element  is  the  responsibility  of  the  NextGen
Partner  that  has  accepted  the  element  as  part  of  their  overall  mission.  For  more
information and to view the IWP Version 1.0, visit www.jpdo.gov.
Q6. I  understand  that  DOD  and  DHS  have  failed  to  identify  their  respective  future

NextGen-related FY09 budgets to JPDO.

Q6a. Has this issue been broached at Senior Policy Committee meetings?

A6a. The  issue  of  shared  responsibility  between  the  Department  of  Commerce  and
the  FAA  for  NextGen  weather  initiatives  has  been  discussed  at  the  SPC.  The  De-
partment  of  Defense  is  sharing  weather  information  already  funded  and  underway
as  part  of  their  core  program.  Joint  weather  programs  are  by  far  the  most  mature
of the JPDO’s interagency collaborations.
Q6b. Why have these agencies not identified their expected contributions?
A6b. The  DOD  and  DHS  have  both  been  working  with  the  Joint  Planning  and  De-
velopment Office to identify their respective NextGen requirements. The DOD, with
the Air Force as the lead service agency, is now actively involved in the development
of  NextGen.  This  includes  net-centric  operations  development,  weather  research,
and demonstration efforts planned for 2009. The Air Force leads the net-centric divi-
sion  at  the  JPDO  and  will  shortly  be  assigning  a  senior  executive  who  will  be  re-
sponsible  for  the  DOD-wide  NextGen  initiative.  The  DOD  has  provided  fiscal  year
2008 funding in support of the net-centric effort.

DHS  also  maintains  a  full  time  presence  at  the  JPDO  and  contributed  to  the
ConOps  by  developing  a  separate  Security  Annex.  They  also  provided  substantial
input  to  the  NextGen  Integrated  Work  Plan  (Version  1.0).  DHS  is  also  providing
funding,  along  with  the  FAA  and  DOD,  for  the  Network  Based  Operations  Dem-
onstration.  Further,  in  an  effort  to  accelerate  its  participation  in  NextGen,  DHS  is
using  the  Florida  area  (also  a  site  for  several  FAA  airspace  related  NextGen  dem-
onstrations)  to  demonstrate  its  ‘‘Project  6’’  which  involves  a  number  of  closely  re-
lated  evolutionary  checkpoint  security  initiatives.  This  includes  a  perimeter  intru-
sion  detection  system,  an  emergency  management  operations  controls  system,  and
unified  air  cargo  tracking.  The  intent  of  this  work,  which  supports  the  JPDO  goal
of  a  curb-to-gate  approach,  is  to  expand  capabilities  to  other  locations  and  then
throughout the United States.
Q6c. How have their omissions impacted NextGen plans and schedules?
A6c. To date NextGen plans and schedules have not been impacted.
Q7. Estimated  costs  for  FAA  investments  needed  to  reach  NextGen’s  end  state  in
2025  have  been  identified  by  the  JPDO  as  being  in  the  range  of  $15  billion  to
$22 billion. Regarding the cost of equipping aircraft with NextGen’s avionics, the
JPDO  said  ‘‘the  most  probable  range  of  total  avionics  costs  to  system  users’’  is
$14 billion to $20 billion.

Q7a. How credible are these numbers?
A7a. The  $15–$22  billion  mentioned  in  the  question  was  developed  several  years
ago  by  a  special  JPDO/Industry  team.  These  estimates  are  preliminary  and  were
useful  in  gauging  the  initial  magnitude  of  NextGen  costs.  Further,  it  should  be
noted that these estimates represented capital expenditures and not life cycle costs.
Q7b. What are the confidence levels associated with these estimates?
A7b. Because  of  the  preliminary  nature  of  both  sets  of  estimates  confidence  levels
were not used.
Q7c. If  confidence  levels  were  not  used,  what  was  the  basis  for  the  cost  estimate

ranges?

A7c. The  data  relied  on  broad  estimates  and  approximations  based  on  the  level  of
operator participation.
Q7d. When  will  these  numbers  be  updated  and  what  confidence  levels  will  they

have?

A7d. As the requirements, program definition and scope of NextGen have continued
to  evolve,  more  accurate  and  comprehensive  estimates  are  being  developed.  The
same can be said of the estimates, noted above, regarding avionics costs.

Estimates  now  under  development  represent  a  much  more  structured  and
verifiable  cost  estimating  process.  All  known  NextGen  programs  and  activities  are
being identified, their costs gathered or developed, adjustments, in terms of program
maturity  are  being  applied,  and  then  the  overall  data  is  being  evaluated  for  com-
pleteness. There will also be sensitivity analysis to account for changes in the avia-
tion  environment,  demand,  and  funding  levels.  On  this  basis,  it  will  be  possible  to
apply  useful  confidence  levels  to  programs  with  known  requirements.  It  should  be
noted that requirements for many key NextGen programs such as Data Communica-
tions and System Wide Information Management as well as requirements for a com-
mon automation platform have not been established. This means that a final, highly

120

accurate  cost  estimate  will  not  be  available  until  these  programs  have  fully  devel-
oped requirements.
Q8. I understand the FAA plans to stand up an integrated test bed of NextGen tech-

nology near Miami to accelerate NextGen implementation.

A8. Background:  We  are  already  utilizing  NextGen  capabilities  that  have  been  es-
tablished  in  the  region  such  as  the  ADS–B  infrastructure  and  capabilities  estab-
lished  by  Embry  Riddle  Aeronautical  University  and  its  partners.  In  addition,  the
test  bed  will  include  the  use  of  performance-based  navigation  tools  to  obtain  valu-
able information that will assist FAA in developing additional requirements, stand-
ards and procedures for operations in the NextGen environment while providing im-
mediate  benefits  to  targeted  areas.  These  efforts  will  focus  on  Florida,  the  east
coast, Texas and the Gulf of Mexico.
Q8a. Which NextGen R&D initiatives will be accelerated?
A8a. Provided below are the names, descriptions, associated NextGen Solution sets
and  the  anticipated  benefits  for  seven  programs  and  projects  we  are  demonstrating
to accelerate NextGen implementation.

Q8b. By how much time will they be accelerated?
A8b. The total time saved will be dependent on the success of these NextGen dem-
onstrations  (i.e.,  did  the  demonstration  validate  the  procedure  or  new  technology),
and  can  the  procedure  or  technology  be  successfully  inserted  in  the  National  Air-
space  System  (NAS)  based  on  related  legacy  technologies,  procedures,  equipment
and  automation;  and  the  arrival  of  newer  NextGen  technologies,  procedures,  equip-
ment  and  automation.  To  the  extent  possible,  every  effort  will  be  made  to  ‘‘bundle’’
developmental successes with other implementation efforts.
Q8c. What user benefits are being achieved earlier?
A8c. The  anticipated  benefits  for  the  seven  NextGen  demonstration  programs  and
projects are provided above. All of these have been accelerated.
Q8d. How will this translate into faster nationwide implementation?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:09 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 044270 PO 00000 Frm 00124 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\091108\44270 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

A8d. The  initial  NextGen  demonstration  effort  is  directed  at  accelerating  oper-
ational procedures in conjunction with established programs as follows:

121

• Establishing criteria for use of Continuous Descent Arrivals in higher density
airports  increases  the  individual  development  and  effective  use  in  a  national
roll-out

• Traffic  Management  Advisor  (TMA),  Conflict  Probe,  and  RNAV/RNP  for  Tai-
lored  Arrival  (TA)  (also  includes  future  domestic  Data  Communications)  and
3–Dimensional Path Arrival Management (3–D PAM),

• Advanced Technology and Oceanic Procedures (ATOP) for Oceanic Trajectory-

TMA,

Based Operations (TBO) proof of concept demonstration,

• TMA and Enhanced Winds Aloft Product to provide Weather integration into

• Airport  Surveillance  Detection  Equipment  Model–X  (ASDE–X)  and  multi-
lateration with Surface Decision Support System (SDSS) development to pro-
vide ‘‘Shared Situational Awareness’’ and ‘‘Collaborative Decision-Making’’ be-
tween air navigation service providers (ANSPs) and airline ramp towers, and
• Development  and/or  leveraging  innovative,  effective  and  efficient  system-to-
system  operational  architecture  with  supporting  procedures  to  provide  the
FAA and its partners with an agile, high connective network for shared situa-
tional awareness through the System-Wide Information Management (SWIM)
network.

Q9. Two  years  ago,  following  a  hearing  on  the  National  Academies’  Decadal  Plan
for Aeronautics, Dr. Kaminski, in an answer for the record, characterized certifi-
cation of new technologies as a key barrier. He said:
‘‘As systems become more complex and non-deterministic, methods to certify new
technologies  become  more  difficult  to  validate.  Core  research  in  methods  and
models  for  assessing  the  performance  of  large-scale  systems,  human  interactive
systems, and non-deterministic systems, and complex, software-intensive systems,
including  safety  and  reliability  in  all  relevant  operating  conditions,  is  essential
for  NASA,  because  such  research  is  currently  beyond  the  capabilities  of  regu-
lators  such  as  the  FAA.’’  He  further  added  that  ‘‘Certification  issues  can  be
show-stoppers if not addressed early in the R&T process.’’
Do you agree with Dr. Kaminski’s concern and if so, what research will you have
to facilitate future certifications, especially for human interactive systems? When
will this research begin and when are significant results anticipated?

A9. The  FAA  believes  it  either  has  the  appropriate  standards  in  place  or  has  the
appropriate  R&D  and  standards-development  activities  underway  to  develop  the
necessary  certification  standards  to  support  the  insertion  of  NextGen  technologies
over the next ten years. Examples include electronic flight bags, ADS–B, Data Com-
munications,  enhanced  flight  vision  systems,  and  complex  software  and  digital  sys-
tems.  The  FAA  works  closely  with  industry  advisory  groups,  such  as  RTCA  and
Aviation Rule-making Committees (ARCs), in developing the new standards.

The  FAA  also  continues  to  explore  longer-term  advanced  NextGen  concepts  be-
yond  the  ten  year  horizon  in  partnership  with  other  partner  agencies,  including
NASA.  As  these  concepts  mature,  the  FAA  will  work  with  these  agencies  to  transi-
tion  the  technology  into  use.  These  transitional  activities  will  include  research  into
the  appropriate  means  to  certify  technologies  that  extend  beyond  the  bounds  of  ex-
isting certification standards.
Q10. One  of  the  biggest  challenges  for  the  FAA  in  implementing  NextGen  will  be  to
not only add or change technologies, but also change the operations of the sys-
tem.

Q10a. How  will  you  integrate  implementation  of  these  technology  programs,  like
ADS–B,  and  the  operations  that  will  take  advantage  of  the  improved  tech-
nology?

A10a. The FAA has developed and maintains an updated NAS Enterprise Architec-
ture  which  provides  the  framework  and  technical  strategy  for  the  integration  and
transition  of  NextGen  capabilities.  NextGen  capabilities  are  implemented  by  apply-
ing  the  principles  of  System  Engineering  both  to  define  the  requirements  for  each
system and to align implementation schedules across programs.
Q10b. Who in FAA will be responsible for integrating and meeting the schedules for

providing these operational capabilities?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:09 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 044270 PO 00000 Frm 00125 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\091108\44270 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

122

A10b. The  Sr.  Vice  President  for  NextGen  and  Operations  Planning  is  responsible
for the integration and implementation of all NextGen elements, which are executed
by program offices and other organizations dispersed throughout the agency. Within
NextGen  and  Operations  Planning,  the  NextGen  Integration  and  Implementation
(I&I)  Office  has  been  established  to  develop  and  manage  the  FAA  NextGen  Imple-
mentation  Plan,  and  the  budget  that  supports  it.  Working  with  the  programs  and
other  performing  organizations,  the  I&I  Office  orchestrates  the  execution  of  major
portfolios of work and is responsible for the integrated program planning necessary
to  achieve  NextGen  capabilities.  The  I&I  Office  is  working  across  all  service  units
and  programs  necessary  to  make  NextGen  successful  to  ensure  all  the  activities
needed to realize a capability are aligned, funded, and on track.
Q11. In  the  House-passed  Reauthorization  Bill,  specific  direction  was  given  to  FAA
to develop a comprehensive plan to safely integrate commercial unmanned air-
craft  systems  into  the  national  airspace  system.  Has  the  JPDO  made  progress
in establishing:

Q11a. What  research  needs  to  be  conducted  to  address  the  safe  integration  of  com-

mercial unmanned aircraft systems into the National Airspace System?

A11a. Developing  a  strategy  for  the  further  integration  of  unmanned  aircraft  sys-
tems into the national airspace system will require extensive research and analysis
before any recommendations can be developed.
Q11b. How  acceptable  standards  for  operations  and  certification  of  commercial  un-

manned aircraft systems would flow from research?

A11b. The  discussion  on  acceptable  standards  will  require  the  involvement  of  the
agencies  that  perceive  a  need  for  possible  UAS  operations  in  controlled  airspace.
The  JPDO  is  engaged  in  multi-agency  discussions  regarding  various  collaborative
approaches to addressing this issue.
Q12. In  the  recently  completed  JPDO  comparison  of  NextGen  and  its  European

counterpart SESAR, it was noted that:

‘‘Probably the most easily recognized difference in the two concepts is the breadth
of  scope.  The  NextGen  ConOps  includes  a  full  ‘curb-to-curb’  approach  that  in-
cludes passenger and intermodal security considerations.’’

A12. The  recently  released  NextGen  Integrated  Work  Plan  (IWP),  Version  1.0  in-
cludes a range of security operational improvements that directly address the needs
of  the  ‘‘curb  to  curb’’  concept.  The  IWP  was  developed  with  the  direct  input  of  all
of the JPDO government and industry partners to include the Department of Home-
land Security.
Q12a. What  are  some  examples  of  R&D  tasks  in  the  Integrated  Work  Plan  that  ad-
dress  ‘‘curb-to-curb’’  aspects  such  as  security,  passenger  delay  at  gates,  etc.?
A12a. The key operational improvements that directly address ‘‘curb-to-curb’’ needs
include  integrated  passenger  screening,  credentialing  and  identification  as  well  as
enhanced and integrated screening and credentialing for airport personnel.
Q12b. What priority is actually being given to those R&D tasks in dollars—or man-

power—terms?

A12b. The IWP will continue to evolve to provide DHS, and the airport community,
as  well  as  other  participating  agencies,  with  important  guidance  to  assist  them  in
developing  their  priorities,  plans  and  budgets.  As  for  priority,  DHS,  through  the
Transportation  Security  Administration,  is  currently  researching  and  testing,  in  an
operational environment, various technologies that will improve passenger screening
and  allow  for  the  integrated  flow  of  data  and  information  in  the  airport  environ-
ment.  The  DHS  is  allocating  $128  million  in  2009  for  the  testing  and  deployment
of new technology for use in screening airline passengers.
Q13. You  indicate  in  your  statement  that  the  Integrated  Work  Plan  (IWP)  will  be
‘‘published  this  month’’  [i.e.,  September  2008].  That  said,  when  will  the
‘‘prioritization of elements’’ you allude to in your statement be completed?

A13. The JPDO Integrated Work Plan (IWP) published in September 2008 provides
initial  guidance  to  NextGen  partner  agencies  on  the  steps  necessary  to  achieve  the
NextGen vision. It does not address priorities of activities.

Each  NextGen  partner  is  responsible  for  developing  detailed  plans  for  the  imple-
mentation  and  execution  of  the  NextGen  needs  within  their  respective  areas  of  re-
sponsibility  and  for  prioritizing  their  respective  tasks.  The  JPDO  has  committed  to
working  closely  with  each  of  its  partners  to  facilitate  alignment  between  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:09 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 044270 PO 00000 Frm 00126 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\091108\44270 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

123

NextGen  partner  plans  and  the  IWP.  FAA’s  near  and  mid-term  plans  have  been
aligned with the IWP. The FAA’s detailed plans are provided in the NextGen Imple-
mentation  Plan  scheduled  to  be  published  in  January  2009.  JPDO  will  not  be  able
to  reflect  cross-agency  prioritization  in  its  IWP  until  all  agency  detailed  NextGen
plans are final.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1a. With the upcoming change in Administrations, do you foresee difficulties main-

taining program continuity during the transition?

A1a. Civil  aviation  is  a  critical  engine  for  economic  growth  and  regardless  of  the
change  in  Administrations,  the  inefficiencies  of  the  current  ground  based  air  traffic
control  system  result  in  delays  that  already  cost  operators  and  consumers  billions
of  dollars  each  year.  We  believe  that  the  new  Administration  will  proceed  with  re-
placing  the  aging  air  traffic  control  infrastructure.  The  industry  needs  NextGen  to
provide  operational,  environmental,  and  safety  enhancements  that  deliver  benefits
to  stakeholders  today  and  prepare  the  way  for  the  future.  The  Congressionally  au-
thorized  approach  to  NextGen  utilizes  a  multi-agency  effort  to  create  and  carry  out
an integrated plan for the NextGen system.
Q1b. Does  NextGen  have  enough  traction  among  its  partner  agencies  to  maintain

momentum in the months ahead?

A1b. There is some concern about remaining under a Continuing Resolution for the
entire  fiscal  year  since  the  FAA  would  be  essentially  operating  at  Fiscal  Year  2008
funding  levels.  The  Fiscal  Year  2009  President’s  Budget  included  a  significant  in-
crease  for  NextGen  over  Fiscal  Year  2008  levels.  This  funding  is  required  to  keep
NextGen  on  track  with  the  published  Implementation  Plan  and  is  necessary  to
achieve the mid-term capacity and environmental goals integral to the National Air-
space System mid-term architecture.
Q2. The  Joint  Planning  and  Development  Office  is  a  planning  and  coordinating
body that relies on the cooperation of its federal partners to provide the expertise
and resources needed to accomplish NextGen.

Q2a. With slightly more than four years of experience, how would you rate the effec-
tiveness  of  the  JPDO,  especially  with  regard  to  engaging  and  sustaining  the
cooperation of the participating federal agencies?

A2a. The interaction has very been promising in many aspects. With the FAA there
has  been  consistent  interaction  on  the  Concept,  Enterprise  Architecture  (EA)  and
Integrated  Work  Plan  (IWP).  This  effort  has  included  alignment  of  the  FAA’s  NAS
EA  with  JPDO’s  NextGen  EA  and  the  FAA’s  NextGen  Implementation  Plan  with
JPDO’s  NextGen  IWP.  Engagement  with  NASA  has  also  been  very  successful.
NASA has been very active in supporting the concept and integrated work plan and,
with the NASA Airspace Program, mapping its research to the IWP. JPDO has also
sponsored  the  creation  of  FAA/NASA  Research  Transition  Teams  to  support  the
technology  transfer  of  products  to  the  FAA  for  implementation  and  the  support  of
the FAA to NASA researchers in areas of operational expertise and system integra-
tion.

With  the  Department  of  Commerce  and  Department  of  Defense  there  has  been
very  good  engagement  on  the  evolution  of  aviation  weather  with  specific  actions
identified  to  improve  collaboration  on  aviation  weather  products.  A  new  effort  with
DOC, DOD and the Department of Homeland Security has recently been established
to  examine  Multi-function  Phased  Array  Radar  for  potential  use  for  weather  and
surveillance purposes.

With  FAA,  DOD  and  DHS  the  JPDO  has  had  good  cooperation  on  Net-Enabled
Operation  (NEO)  demonstrations,  which  have  been  successfully  fostered  by  JPDO.
JPDO has also been successful this year in getting DOD commitment to expand its
role  in  NextGen  with  a  large  emphasis  on  enabling  net-centric  operations,  a  core
requirement for all the member agencies to move NextGen forward.
Q2b. What concerns, if any, do you have about the JPDO’s effectiveness following the

reorganization?

A2b. Collaboration  among  the  JPDO  partner  agencies  has  continued  to  increase
since  the  reorganization.  The  reorganization  will  continue  to  strengthen  the  effec-
tiveness  of  JPDO  as  the  agencies  begin  to  move  from  planning  to  implementation.
Even  in  early  implementation  activities  such  as  NEO  or  weather  or  tech  transfer
from  NASA  to  FAA,  there  is  a  shift  from  activity  leader  to  facilitator  on  the  part
of  JPDO.  With  focus  on  implementation  activities  growing,  the  inclusion  of  JPDO

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:09 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 044270 PO 00000 Frm 00127 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\091108\44270 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

124

closer  to  that  action  will  improve  JPDO’s  ability  to  facilitate  cross-agency  coopera-
tion  for  the  near  and  mid-term  while  not  diminishing  its  continuing  role  as  long-
term definition leader.
Q3. FAA  is  taking  on  greater  research  and  development  responsibility  for  NextGen,

notably in disciplines that had been conducted by NASA.

A3. The  FAA  has  been  evaluating  the  resources  that  will  be  required  to  support
NextGen  research  and  development  (R&D)  during  this  past  year  and  the  following
are the results to date.
Q3a. Where will these new research capabilities be housed?
A3a. The  FAA  has  conducted  a  gap  analysis  to  assess  how  existing  NAS  modeling,
simulation, and test facilities support the R&D necessary for design and implemen-
tation of NextGen. This analysis has identified shortfalls in existing capabilities, the
need  for  some  new  simulation  capabilities,  and  opportunities  to  leverage  external
ATC,  flight  deck,  and  software  assurance  capabilities.  As  a  result,  the  FAA  is  up-
grading, co-locating, and integrating existing ATM and CNS simulation capabilities
to support NextGen concept validation and integration studies. Also, the FAA, DOD
and NASA are participating in a year long examination of the national research and
development  infrastructure.  This  study,  directed  by  the  Office  of  Science  and  Tech-
nology  Policy,  is  comparing  existing  research  facilities  across  the  Federal  Govern-
ment to requirements identified in the National Aeronautics Research Plan and will
report on both shortfalls and duplications.

Traditionally,  the  FAA  has  evaluated  concepts  and  technologies  through  the  use
of modeling, simulation (both fast time and real time human in the loop), engineer-
ing analysis, field prototypes, and operational demonstrations. For NextGen, we are
establishing partnerships with industry, academia, and the airlines to develop three
NextGen demonstration capabilities in New York, Texas, and Florida.
Q3b. Will FAA have to build new facilities?
A3b. The FAA continues to maintain our 30+ year relationship with NASA through
the  FAA  Research  Field  Offices  at  NASA  Langley  and  NASA  Ames  Research  Cen-
ters,  with  researchers  also  on-site  at  NASA  Glenn  and  NASA  Kennedy  Space  Cen-
ter.  Through  ongoing  Interagency  Agreements,  FAA  can  use  NASA  facilities  and
personnel  to  augment  our  research  capabilities.  Moreover,  the  FAA  is  accelerating
transition  from  research  to  implementation  through  Research  Transition  Teams
(RTT)  between  NASA  and  FAA,  facilitated  by  the  JPDO.  The  goal  of  the  RTTs  is
to  ensure  that  R&D  needed  for  NextGen  implementation  is  identified,  conducted,
and effectively transitioned to the implementing agency

While  considerable  attention  must  be  given  to  the  research  needed  to  develop
NextGen,  we  must  also  note  that  the  FAA  is  maintaining  a  healthy  research  pro-
gram  in  our  core  research  areas  of  aircraft  safety,  airport  technology,  fire  safety,
fuels  and  propulsion,  human  factors,  weather,  wake  turbulence,  atmospheric  haz-
ards,  airworthiness  assurance,  and  the  environment  and  energy.  We  maintain  a
cadre of world class scientists and engineers supported by unique national facilities
at the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center.
Q3c. Does  FAA  have  the  scientists,  engineers  and  project  managers  to  carry  out  the

research?

A3c. The FAA is adding scientists, engineers and project managers to its workforce.
To ensure that we have aligned the right capabilities, the FAA has enlisted the Na-
tional  Academy  of  Public  Administration  to  assess  the  skill  sets  required  to  imple-
ment  NextGen  and  develop  a  strategy  to  obtain  this  expertise.  Internally,  staffing
needs continue to be assessed corporately and, over the past two years, the NextGen
and Operations Planning Office have hired 178 new employees within the technical
and  programmatic  disciplines.  Training  programs  in  the  areas  of  project  manage-
ment,  system  engineering,  safety  management,  human  factors,  and  modeling  and
simulation  are  available.  In  2004,  the  ATO  Systems  Engineering  Program  was  es-
tablished  offering  certificates  in  1)  System  Design  and  Architecture  and  2)
Supportability  and  Logistics.  To  date,  57  graduate  certificates  have  been  earned  by
ATO employees and 60 more employees are currently enrolled in the program.

Additionally, 75 universities augment our internal resources through our congres-
sionally  mandated  Air  Transportation  Centers  of  Excellence  (COE)  long-term  part-
nerships.  The  university  members  and  their  industrial  affiliates  conduct  research,
education  and  training  in  the  following  mission  critical  focus  areas:  airport  tech-
nology,  operations  research,  general  aviation,  noise  and  emissions  mitigation,  ad-
vanced  materials,  and  research  in  the  intermodal  transportation  environment.  In
addition to providing access to their research facilities throughout the country, more

than 100 world-class faculty and 300 graduate students are currently available and
prepared to support ongoing aviation research requirements.
Q4a. Will  FAA  decommission  its  network  of  ground-based  radars  once  NextGen  is
fully  implemented,  and  if  so,  how  will  our  government  track  non-cooperating
targets?

A4a. The  FAA  maintains  and  uses  two  types  of  radars—primary  radars  which  do
not  require  cooperation,  they  ‘‘skin  paint,’’  and  the  radio  based  secondary  radars
which  do  require  the  aircraft  to  cooperate.  The  NextGen  implementation  of  ADS–
B is directly related to the cooperative secondary surveillance radars.

While ADS–B will offer considerable benefits in terms of system operations there
are  additional  security  and  national  defense  concerns  that  need  to  be  considered.
Both  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  and  the  Department  of  Defense
(DOD)  have  expressed  the  need  for  continued  primary,  non-cooperative  radar  capa-
bilities.

The FAA also recognizes that a back-up system is needed in case of problems with
the GPS satellite system In 2006, a team from the FAA, industry, and the military
performed  an  analysis  and  the  agency  adopted  the  recommendation  to  maintain
about  half  the  current  network  of  secondary  radars  as  an  ADS–B  back-up  system.
The table below highlights the plan to reduce the existing 365 Secondary Surveil-
lance  Radars  (SSRs)  used  for  both  terminal  and  en  route  surveillance  to  190  SSRs
(40 terminal and 150 en route).

Q4b. Who  will  have  principal  responsibility  to  detect  and  monitor  unfriendly  air-

craft?

A4b. The  FAA  does  not  plan  to  remove  any  primary  radar  systems  and  continues
to  use  primary  radar  to  mitigate  single-aircraft  avionics  failures.  Primary  radar
data  remains  available  to  the  DOD  and  DHS  to  detect  and  monitor  unfriendly  air-
craft.

The  long-term  strategy  for  non-cooperative  surveillance  requires  a  multi-agency
perspective. As part of its cross-agency role, NextGen’s Joint Planning and Develop-
ment  Office  (JPDO)  has  established  a  joint  Interagency  Surveillance  Study  Team
(ISST)  working  with  the  DOD,  the  DHS,  the  Department  of  Transportation,  the
Federal  Aviation  Administration,  and  the  Department  of  Commerce  to  address  the
issue.

The  ISST  has  recommended  the  establishment  of  a  formal  and  institutionalized
mechanism  for  the  management  and  ownership  (to  include  funding)  of  the  Nation’s
integrated surveillance capabilities. Under this approach all future national aviation
surveillance  information  requirements  are  analyzed  holistically.  This  JPDO  led  ap-
proach  will  ensure  that  the  needs  and  responsibilities  of  the  key  stakeholders  are
addressed.

These  proposals  have  been  presented  to  the  JPDO’s  Board  of  Directors  and  will

shortly be considered by the NextGen Senior Policy Council.
Q4c. To what extent will the introduction of NextGen-related capabilities lead to the

closure of other (non-radar) obsolete FAA facilities?

A4c. As  we  evolve  to  NextGen,  we  anticipate  that  fewer  facilities  will  be  needed  to
operate  the  National  Airspace  System  in  a  safe  and  efficient  manner.  As  the  FAA
and  the  aviation  community  transitions  to  satellite-based  navigation  capabilities,
the  number  of  ground  navigation  systems  can  be  significantly  reduced  with  the  ex-
tent  and  time-frame  for  this  reduction  dependent  upon  the  speed  which  aircraft
owners  equip  with  new  avionics.  Up  to  a  50  percent  reduction  in  legacy  en  route

navigation  facilities  is  considered  reasonable  in  the  NextGen  time  frame.  In  addi-
tion, a significant number of ground-based approach and landing systems in the air-
port  environment  (ILS,  Terminal  VOR’s)  can  eventually  be  decommissioned  and  re-
placed with GPS-enabled capabilities.
Q5. The ADS–B program is fundamental to NextGen. What are the major risks with

ADS–B in terms of capabilities, schedule, cost, and industry acceptance?

A5. The  FAA  has  a  rigorous  risk  management  process  required  on  every  program.
As part of that process, the ADS–B program has identified its high risks, developed
mitigation  plans  for  those  risks,  and  maintained  a  status  report  on  the  progress  of
those mitigation activities. These are the high risks:

Industry Acceptance:

Risk Statement: If National Airspace System users demonstrate active opposition
to  avionics  related  airspace  mandates  (ADS–B),  there  may  be  delays  in  required
rule-making  activities  and/or  the  program  may  experience  a  reduction  in  benefits.
Planned  Mitigation:  This  is  a  four  pronged  approach:  1)  getting  the  right  imple-
mentation  and  benefits  message  out  (measure  this  with  feedback,  user  surveys,
etc.),  2)  quickly  move  to  resolve  community  issues  through  accelerated  rule-making
activities,  3)  delivering  a  legacy  transitioning  plan,  and  4)  working  with  the  Air
Traffic  Management  Advisory  Committee  (ATMAC).  The  ATMAC  provides  a  forum
for user interface.

Status on Mitigation Plans: The Notice of Proposed Rule-making comment period
closed in March 2008; An Aviation Rule-making Committee (ARC) was chartered to
review  benefits  of  early  equipage  and  to  review  comments  received  on  the  NPRM.
The ARC submitted its recommendations on the NPRM comments on September 26,
2008.  The  FAA  is  currently  drafting  plans  for  responding  to  the  ARC  recommenda-
tions  on  early  equipage.  In  addition,  the  program  office  has  been  actively  engaged
in user community outreach activities, including industry days and user community
conferences.

ADS–B broadcasting on 1090 MHz:

Risk  Statement:  Without  proper  control  of  the  1090  MHz  spectrum,  the  addition
of  SBS  (Surveillance  and  Broadcast  Services)  to  the  current  environment  may  re-
duce the performance of ADS–B and other 1090 MHz systems, reducing benefits and
system performance.

Planned Mitigation: To mitigate this risk of spectrum saturation, two parallel ap-
proaches are underway: 1) 1090 MHz Spectrum Risk Panel is looking into the tech-
nical  effectiveness  of  implementing  various  proposed  solutions  to  reduce  the  indi-
vidual  1090  MHz  systems  usage  of  1090  MHz  ,  and  2)  1090  MHz  Spectrum  Alter-
natives  Analysis  team  is  to  provide  a  low-risk,  cost  effective  solution  to  be  imple-
mented to reduce the congestion problem.

Status  on  Mitigation  Plans:  The  Spectrum  Risk  Panel  provided  a  final  report  to
the  FAA  program  office  in  August  2008.  Additional  assessments  and  recommenda-
tions for mitigations are underway. The Alternatives Analysis team defined their ob-
jectives  and  requirements  and  will  develop  final  alternatives  and  definitions  based
on the August Spectrum Risk Panel report.

Displaying  ADS–B  Data  in  the  current  automation  platforms  and  their  related  dis-

plays:

Risk  Statement:  Currently  the  automation  platform  (MEARTS)  does  not  process
and  display  ADS–B  data  provided  by  ITT.  If  MEARTS  is  not  modified  to  support
that  data  set  by  April  2010,  the  Surveillance  and  Broadcast  Services  Juneau  IOC
will be delayed.

Planned  Mitigation:  Establish  an  automation  requirements  work  group.  Coordi-
nate with computer human interface work group, separation standards work group,
and system test and evaluation work group. Conduct alternatives analysis to deter-
mine  preferred  means  to  integrate  the  ADS–B  data  on  each  automation  platform.
Develop  prototypes  and  conduct  simulations  on  automation  systems,  and  develop
final automation requirements.

Status  of  Mitigation  Plans:  The  final  visual  specification  for  use  of  multiple  sur-
veillance sources in Air Traffic Control has been provided by program office. Agree-
ments on plans to resolve the computer human interface requirements and automa-
tion  requirement  issues  have  been  reached.  The  program  office  is  currently  final-
izing an integrated schedule for the automation platform.

quire additional focus. For the record please: (1) identify them; (2) designate the

partner agency having primary responsibility; and (3) describe how each of these
critical areas will be addressed.

A6. According to the JPDO’s analysis there are seven critical areas that require ad-
ditional focus. The following are the issues involved:

Question submitted by Representative Laura Richardson
Q1. What  are  your  thoughts  on  concerns  conveyed  April  1–2,  2008  at  the  National

Academies workshop?

A1. The  National  Academies  workshop  provided  interesting  perspectives  that  high-
lighted  some  shortfalls  regarding  the  JPDO,  NextGen  and  the  NextGen  R&D  Plan.
There was significant discussion regarding the importance of system level modeling
to  support  NextGen  planning,  research,  and  investment.  This  discussion  was  par-
ticularly  timely  and  validated  a  JPDO  focus  in  that  at  the  time  of  the  workshop,
JPDO  was  in  the  process  of  developing  a  much  more  rigorous  modeling  capability
based on its determination of this shortfall.

Another  major  point  was  the  limited  scope  of  R&D  programs  that  has  been  re-
viewed  and  considered  to  date.  This  was  a  valuable  insight.  The  workshop  discus-
sion  highlighted  the  need  to  look  beyond  FAA  and  NASA,  and  consider  other  agen-
cies,  the  private  sector  (especially  the  airport  community)  and  international  bodies.
The  JPDO  has  increased  its  efforts  with  respect  to  each  of  these  sectors  and  the
workshop discussion was helpful in guiding that effort. The newly established multi-
agency,  DOD  led,  net-centric  initiative  is  a  good  example  of  the  JPDO  increased
scope and leadership.

Finally,  there  was  substantial  discussion  centered  on  implementation.  While  the
participants acknowledged that the JPDO is not an implementation entity, they ex-
pressed  concern  that  the  plans  did  not  provide  the  community  with  a  clear  view  of
a structured pathway to implementation. The recent FAA reorganization makes this

connection clear with the creation of an integration and implementation entity with-
in the Air Traffic Organization.

Questions submitted by Representative Paul C. Broun
Q1. On  October  5,  2007,  the  FAA  issued  a  proposed  rule  requiring  aircraft  in  con-

trolled airspace be equipped with ADS–B by 2020.

A1. Background:

An Aviation Rule-making Committee (ARC) was chartered in July 2007 to support
the ADS–B rule-making. The ARC’s membership covers every sector of the aviation
industry, and includes members from the government and academia. The ARC was
tasked to:

• Serve as a platform for developing a report in optimizing operational benefits
of ADS–B prior to implementing a nationwide ADS–B airspace rule. (This re-
port  was  delivered  in  October  2007.  The  FAA  is  currently  developing  plans
to address the report.)

• Make  specific  recommendations  to  the  FAA  concerning  the  NPRM  require-

ments (this report was delivered in September 2008).

Q1a. What is the FAA doing or what is the FAA’s plan to encourage voluntary ADS–
B equipage? It seems that the FAA is too focused on the equipage mandate, and
that  a  better  approach  would  be  to  focus  on  the  avionics  and  incentives  to  en-
courage voluntary equipage.

A1a. The  FAA  is  engaging  with  the  community  to  encourage  equipage,  and  many
of  the  recommendations  cited  in  the  ARC’s  October  2007  report  demonstrate  that
there  is  a  willingness  by  the  airlines  to  equip  early,  provided  that  the  FAA  creates
the  environment  (infrastructure,  routes  and  procedures)  that  enables  early  benefits
to  airline  operations.  Specifically,  two  of  the  ARC  recommendations  focus  on  agree-
ments:

• Recommendation  #9:  Leverage  the  benefits  of  ADS–B 

information  to

incentivize equipage by establishing agreements with specific operators.

• Recommendation  #10:  Continue  to  establish  agreements  with  local  and  State

governments to leverage the benefits of ADS–B.

Since  that  initial  ARC  report,  the  FAA  has  held  the  following  meetings  to  deter-

mine incentive mechanisms that might be included in potential agreements:

• January 2008: NetJets, American Airlines, FedEx
• April 2008: Continental Airlines, DayJet, Wisconsin Department of Transpor-

tation, Minnesota Department of Transportation

• May 2008: DayJet Follow-up
• June  2008:  Follow-up  with  American  Airlines,  California  Department  of

Transportation

• July 2008: Additional Follow-up with American Airlines, United Airlines
• October 2008: USAirways

The  following  table  summarizes  the  feedback  from  these  meetings  and  shows

what may be an incentive to users to equip early.

129

Q2. The ADS–B equipage mandate is extremely costly and provides no benefit to gen-

eral aviation.

Q2a. The  majority  of  the  benefits  are  in  the  high-altitude  airspace  or  for  aircraft
landing  at  the  Nation’s  35  OEP  airports.  So,  why  is  the  mandate  so  broad?
A2a. While it is true that many of the advanced applications of ADS–B In and Out
will be of benefit to the high altitude major metro area customers, the initial bene-
fits of ADS–B have and will support the low altitude user group by providing traffic
and flight information to ADS–B equipped aircraft. The provision of radar-like serv-
ices  and  the  increased  situational  awareness  for  the  pilot  have  supported  aircraft
operating in more remote areas and aircraft operating under visual flight rules. Spe-
cific low altitude user groups that have and will benefit from ADS–B include opera-
tors in Alaska, helicopters, especially in the Gulf of Mexico where a significant num-
ber  of  daily  operations  take  place,  and  General  Aviation  aircraft  across  NAS  espe-
cially  with  the  related  traffic  and  flight  advisory  information,  and  support  timely
search and rescue.
Q2b. Has  the  FAA  considered  limiting  the  ADS–B  equipage  mandate  to  aircraft  op-

erating above FL180 or landing at the Nation’s 35 OEP airports?

A2b. Background: The ADS–B Aviation Rule-making Committee (ARC) was formed
in  July  2007  to  support  the  ADS–B  rule-making.  The  ARC’s  membership  covers
every  facet  of  the  aviation  industry,  and  includes  members  from  the  government
and academia. The ARC was organized to provide the agency the broadest perspec-
tive  possible  as  it  advances  the  ADS–B  rule-making.  The  committee  had  the  fol-
lowing two tasks:

• As  an  initial  tasking  before  the  publication  of  the  Notice  of  Proposed  Rule-
making  (NPRM),  the  ARC  should  serve  as  a  platform  for  the  development  of
a report on how operational benefits of ADS–B could be optimized before com-
pliance  with  a  nationwide  ADS–B  mandate.  The  report  was  delivered  to  the
FAA in October 2007.

• Once  the  NPRM  is  published  and  reviewed  by  the  ARC,  the  ARC  should
make specific recommendations to the FAA about any changes that should be
made  to  the  proposed  language  in  the  NPRM.  The  ARC  provided  these  rec-
ommendations to the FAA on September 26, 2008.

The  ARC,  as  a  part  of  its  work  on  its  second  task,  evaluated  a  phased  approach
to  implementing  ADS–B  which  would  have  required  ADS–B  sooner  in  Class  A  air-
space  and  at  the  Nation’s  35  OEP  airports.  The  ARC  was  unable  to  reach  a  con-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:09 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 044270 PO 00000 Frm 00133 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\091108\44270 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

130

sensus on this approach and, therefore, recommended that the FAA retain the 2020
compliance date in the original Notice of Proposed Rule-making (NPRM).

To  further  address  the  issue  of  low  altitude  equipage,  the  ARC  identified  addi-
tional  measures  that  would  benefit  the  low  altitude  community  and  recommended
that the FAA take advantage of the opportunity to provide a positive business case
for  that  large  segment  of  the  aviation  community.  Specifically,  Recommendation  #9
requests:

The FAA should implement the necessary incentives to create a positive business
case for low altitude airspace users. This requires the FAA to make changes that
result in lower investment costs and increased benefits, and provide economic in-
centives to offset costs when benefits are insufficient for a particular operator seg-
ment.  If  the  ADS–B  mandate  results  in  the  low  altitude  segment  of  the  aviation
community  investing  more  into  the  system  than  the  benefits  enabled,  the  FAA
should not mandate ADS–B Out for that segment of the community.

In addition, Recommendation #18 suggests:

The  ARC,  based  upon  analysis  it  has  performed,  urges  the  FAA  to  allow  non-
diversity  antenna  installations  for  visual  flight  rules  (VFR)  aircraft  flying
through high-density airspace, for example class B and C and below 15,000 feet
(1090) or below FL 180 (UAT) but not landing at the primary airports. Addition-
ally,  the  FAA  should  continue  to  resolve  the  barriers  (as  identified  by  the  ARC)
to permit single-antenna installations on low altitude, slow moving aircraft. The
ARC  recommends  that  the  FAA  conduct  the  necessary  testing  to  identify  appro-
priate solutions.

The  Surveillance  and  Broadcast  Services  program  office  is  currently  evaluating
these  recommendations  from  the  ARC  and  will  determine  how  to  proceed  for  the
final rule on ADS–B equipage.
Q3. The DOT Inspector General, GAO and others have testified that stakeholder ac-
ceptance is going to be key to a successful ATC modernization and transition to
a satellite-based system.

A3. The  ADS–B  Aviation  Rule-making  Committee  (ARC)  was  formed  in  July  2007
to support the ADS–B rule-making. The ARC’s membership covers every facet of the
aviation  industry,  and  includes  members  from  the  government  and  academia.1 The
ARC was organized to provide the agency the broadest perspective possible as it ad-
vances the ADS–B rule-making.
Q3a. While the entire aviation industry supports modernization, as far as I can tell,
the  FAA’s  strategy  and  implementation  plan  has  little  (possibly  no)  support
from stakeholders.

A3a. In  the  September  26,  2008  report,  the  ARC  emphasized  its  support  for  ADS–
B Out implementation by 2020.
Q3b. How is the FAA handling the comments submitted from aviation stakeholders?
A3b. The  ARC  reviewed  1,423  comments  on  the  Notice  of  Proposed  Rule-making
(NPRM)  submitted  to  the  docket  by  165  entities,  categorized  the  comments  for  fur-
ther  analysis,  and  studied  the  issues  underlying  1,101  of  the  1,423  comments.  The
ARC  was  tasked  with  resolving  these  comments  and  making  a  final  recommenda-
tion to the FAA, which was provided on September 26, 2008. The committee focused
on  the  link  implementation  strategy,  programmatic  issues,  performance  require-
ments  and  an  avionics  transition  plan.  The  ARC  made  36  summary  recommenda-
tions  regarding  the  ADS–B  link  strategy,  program,  business  case,  required  equip-
ment, security, and privacy.

The  Surveillance  and  Broadcast  Services  (SBS)  program  office  is  reviewing  this
report  and  will  determine  how  to  proceed  with  the  recommendations  prior  to  final-
izing  the  rule.  In  addition,  the  SBS  program  office  is  reviewing  the  remaining  322
comments  not  addressed  in  the  ARC  submittal.  These  comments  focus  on  general

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Gerald L. Dillingham, Director, Physical Infrastructure Issues, Govern-

ment Accountability Office

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. Some  observers  have  commented  that  the  degree  of  participation  by  the  partner
agencies  seems  to  run  on  a  continuum  from  a  significant  amount  of  participa-
tion  to  seemingly  not  very  much  at  all.  The  Federal  Aviation  Administration
(FAA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are consist-
ently indicated as the most involved participants.

Q1a. In  your  opinion,  to  what  extent  are  the  partner  agencies  participating  in  the
vision and work of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen)?
A1a. The partner agencies’ participation in the vision and work of NextGen has var-
ied  to  date  and  will  continue  to  evolve  over  time.  Interagency  partnerships  mature
slowly  because  it  takes  time  to  forge  working  relationships  and  establish  account-
ability. While FAA and NASA have been the most involved in the planning and co-
ordination  of  NextGen,  the  other  agencies  are  also  participating.  The  Department
of Defense, for example, is transferring to NextGen the technology it has developed
for sharing information across networks, establishing a program office to coordinate
all  of  its  NextGen  activities,  and  collaborating  with  FAA  and  the  Department  of
Commerce to develop and implement NextGen’s weather forecasting capability.

Furthermore, the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO), which was cre-
ated  to  plan  for  and  coordinate  the  NextGen  activities  of  federal  and  non-federal
stakeholders, has established some practices that are important to institutionalizing
a  collaborative  process.  For  example,  a  memorandum  of  understanding,  signed  by
the Secretary or another high-ranking official from each partner agency, defines the
partner agencies’ roles and responsibilities. In addition, some NextGen goals and ac-
tivities  have  been  incorporated  in  partner  agencies’  key  planning  documents  such
as  FAA’s  NextGen  Implementation  Plan,  and  JPDO  and  the  Office  of  Management
and  Budget  (OMB)  have  developed  a  process  for  identifying  NextGen-related  re-
search programs in the partner agencies’ budgets.
Q1b. How could the role of the partner agencies be changed to enhance their partici-

pation or positively affect the development of NextGen?

A1b. We  believe  that  the  partner  agencies’  participation  in  NextGen  could  be  en-
hanced  by  further  incorporating  NextGen  goals  and  activities  in  the  agencies’  key
planning  documents  and  research  agendas.  For  example,  FAA  has  refocused  one  of
its key planning documents—the Operational Evolution Partnership—making it into
the NextGen Implementation Plan. Formerly a plan for enhancing airport capacity,
the  NextGen  Implementation  Plan  has  been  expanded  and  revamped  to  become  a
comprehensive  description  of  how  FAA  will  implement  NextGen.  We  believe  that
similar  efforts  by  the  other  partner  agencies  could  increase  their  participation  in
NextGen.
Q2. In  your  opinion,  how  successful  has  JPDO  been  in  developing  conceptual  and
technical descriptions of what NextGen will consist of? How about in developing
a plan for the coordinated implementation of a transformed future system?

A2. JPDO  has  made  progress  in  developing  planning  documents  that  provide  con-
ceptual  and  technical  descriptions  of  NextGen.  However,  further  iterations  of  these
documents  will  be  needed  as  NextGen  technologies  are  developed.  JPDO’s  author-
izing legislation requires the office to create a research and development (R&D) plan
for the transition to NextGen. This requirement led JPDO to develop initial versions
of  the  Concept  of  Operations,  Enterprise  Architecture,  and  Integrated  Work  Plan
(IWP).  The  Concept  of  Operations  is  the  fundamental  planning  document  from
which the other two documents flow. Version 2 of the Concept of Operations, issued
in  June  2007,  describes  how  the  NextGen  system  is  envisioned  to  operate  in  2025.
Version 2 of the Enterprise Architecture, issued in July 2007, is a technical descrip-
tion of the NextGen system, akin to blueprints for a building. The Enterprise Archi-
tecture  provides  a  means  for  coordinating  among  the  partner  agencies  and  private-
sector  manufacturers,  aligning  relevant  R&D  activities,  and  integrating  equipment.
IWP,  the  most  recent  version  of  which  was  issued  in  September  2008,  is  JPDO’s
plan for achieving NextGen. It describes the integrated framework needed to transi-
tion to NextGen and will continually need to be refined and enhanced to reflect cur-
rent priorities, budgets, and programs.

Our  work  indicated  that  the  previous  version  of  IWP  lacked  critical  information
and  was  not  sufficiently  ‘‘user  friendly’’  to  be  used  effectively  as  a  plan  for  coordi-
nating the partner agencies’ implementation of NextGen. Our review of the most re-
cent version of the plan indicates that it is more detailed, contains further research
plans,  and  shows  interrelationships  among  activities  that  should  be  useful  for  co-
ordinating  those  activities.  This  version  of  IWP  is  an  automated,  searchable,  user-
friendly database—that we found will have the capability to track dates and identify
programs  that  are  behind  schedule,  making  it  useful,  but  not  sufficient,  for  over-
sight.  According  to  senior  JPDO  officials,  this  version  identifies  the  specific  oper-
ational  improvements  and  capabilities  that  NextGen  will  incorporate  and  shows
what  policies,  research,  and  other  activities  are  needed  to  enable  those  improve-
ments and capabilities; when they are needed; and what entities are responsible for
them.  Moreover,  this  version  includes  schedule  information  that  has  been  updated
to  reflect  newly  available  information,  coordination  with  FAA  schedules  and  plans,
and public comments received on the previous version, according to JPDO and FAA
officials.  This  version  also  identifies  the  sequence  of  research  activities  that  the
partner  agencies  must  complete  before  specific  NextGen  capabilities  can  be  imple-
mented. The plan should serve as a useful tool in prioritizing and tracking NextGen
research.

Furthermore, subsequent versions of IWP are expected to include cost information
that  decision-makers  can  use  to  help  understand  the  rationale  for  budget  requests,
monitor  costs,  and  improve  future  cost  estimates  for  acquisitions.  This  information
will  be  helpful  to  decision-makers  when  budget  constraints  do  not  allow  all  system
acquisitions to be fully funded at planned and approved levels and they must decide
which programs to fund and which to cut or delay according to their priorities.

In addition, coordination is enhanced by JPDO’s efforts to work with OMB to de-
velop  a  process  that  allows  OMB  to  identify  NextGen-related  research  and  acquisi-
tion  projects  across  the  partner  agencies  and  consider  NextGen  as  a  unified,  cross-
agency program. Under this process, JPDO and its partner agencies jointly present
OMB  with  business  cases  for  the  partner  agencies’  NextGen-related  efforts,  and
these  business  cases  are  used  as  inputs  to  funding  decisions  for  NextGen  research
and acquisitions across the agencies.
Q3. In  the  transformed  NextGen,  I  understand  that  roles  and  responsibilities  of  key
players  will  change  dramatically.  Pilots  will  take  on  more  separation  respon-
sibilities  and  automation  will  enable  air  traffic  controllers  to  manage  larger
numbers of aircraft while improving safety.

Q3a. What  are  the  key  aspects  from  human  factors  research  that  FAA  and  NASA
need to get right before we can have confidence that this delegation of decision-
making duties is both feasible and safe?

A3a. Our work indicates that the key aspect from human factors research that FAA
and NASA must address is how changes in the roles and responsibilities of both air
traffic  controllers  and  pilots  will  affect  the  safety  and  efficiency  of  the  national  air-
space  system.  According  to  an  FAA  official,  verbal  communication  is  an  example  of
a  human  factors  area  that  requires  further  R&D.  Currently,  air  traffic  controllers
primarily rely on verbal communication to direct aircraft. Because NextGen will rely
more on automated communications, controllers will require training in both under-
standing and operating in an automated communications environment. The research
to support such training has not been conducted, according to FAA.
Q3b. Are  the  needed  R&D  programs  in  place  and  adequately  funded  to  get  that  re-

search done?

A3b. While  not  all  of  the  needed  human  factors  R&D  programs  are  currently  in
place,  FAA  plans  to  increase  its  investment  in  human  factors  research  from  fiscal
year 2009 through fiscal year 2013. Over that period, FAA’s human factors research
would  total  $180.4  million.  In  contrast,  NASA  started  to  reduce  the  size  of  its
human factors research staff in fiscal year 2005, reassigning some staff to other pro-
grams  and  reducing  the  contractor  and  academic  technical  support  for  human  fac-
tors research. However, according to NASA, human factors research continues to be
a  critical  component  of  its  aeronautics  research  program,  with  activity  focused  at
the foundational level. It remains to be seen if FAA’s planned R&D in this area will
offset  NASA’s  reductions,  since  FAA’s  research  is  typically  at  a  more  applied  level.
Q4. In  describing  FAA’s  Continuous  Lower  Energy,  Emissions,  and  Noise  (CLEEN)
environmental R&D program, your statement indicates that FAA and the JPDO
recognize  the  need  to  ‘‘fill  any  gaps  that  may  exist  between  basic  research  and
the transfer to industry for further development.’’ But you also conclude that ‘‘the
research might prove more difficult and take longer than planned.’’

Q4a. Can  you  elaborate  on  why  this  might  be  more  difficult  and  time-consuming

than envisioned and how FAA can minimize this problem?

134

A4a. Filling  gaps  that  may  exist  between  conducting  basic  research  and  transfer-
ring  technologies  and  tools  to  industry  may  be  more  difficult  and  time  consuming
than  envisioned  for  several  reasons.  CLEEN  illustrates  this  challenge.  The  House
reauthorization  bill  for  FAA  is  seeking  funding  for  CLEEN.1 CLEEN  would  estab-
lish a research consortium of government, industry, and academic participants that
would  allow  for  the  maturation  of  aviation  noise  technologies  via  demonstration
projects  for  further  refinement  by  the  aviation  industry  and  eventual  incorporation
into  new  aircraft  designs.  The  CLEEN  program  would  support  the  development,
maturation,  and  certification  of  engine  and  airframe  technologies  for  aircraft  over
the next 10 years to reduce aviation noise and emissions. While acknowledging that
CLEEN would help bridge the gap between NASA’s R&D and manufacturers’ even-
tual  incorporation  of  technologies  into  aircraft  designs,  aeronautics  industry  rep-
resentatives  and  experts  we  consulted  said  that  the  program’s  funding  levels  may
not be sufficient to attain the goals specified in the proposal. According to these ex-
perts,  the  proposed  funding  levels  would  allow  for  the  further  development  of  one
or  possibly  two  projects.  Moreover,  in  one  expert’s  view,  the  funding  for  these
projects  may  be  sufficient  only  to  develop  the  technology  to  the  level  that  achieves
an  emissions-reduction  goal  in  testing,  not  to  the  level  required  for  the  technology
to  be  incorporated  into  a  new  engine  design.  According  to  FAA  and  some  experts
we consulted, however, the CLEEN program amounts to a pilot project, and if it re-
sults in the development of emissions-reduction technologies that can be introduced
into aircraft in the near future, it could lead to additional funding from the govern-
ment or industry for such efforts.

Filling R&D gaps may also be more difficult and time-consuming than envisioned
because of uncertainties about the ability of aircraft engine and aircraft manufactur-
ers to incorporate new noise reduction technologies into new engine and aircraft de-
signs. NASA officials stressed that when NASA’s research ends, it will be up to en-
gine and aircraft manufacturers to take the next steps to integrate the noise reduc-
tion  technologies  into  engine  and  aircraft  designs,  and  the  manufacturers’  willing-
ness to do so is not guaranteed. An expert we consulted noted that if manufacturers
do  take  the  steps  to  integrate  noise  reduction  technologies  into  new  designs,  the
pace of noise reduction will also depend on the pace of development for new aircraft
and aircraft engine designs.

Moreover, technical challenges may further complicate efforts to close the gap be-
tween  agencies’  research  and  manufacturers’  development  of  technologies  for  incor-
poration into products. In particular, it may be technically challenging to design air-
craft  with  reduced  noise  while,  at  the  same  time,  achieving  significant  reductions
in  greenhouse  gases  and  other  emissions  that  will  be  required  to  address  global
warming  and  improve  air  quality.  Although  it  is  possible  to  design  engines  that
produce  less  noise  and  fewer  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  the  reductions  in  green-
house  gases  could  be  limited  in  engines  that  produce  substantially  less  noise.  Fur-
thermore, engines that produce less noise typically burn more fuel and are therefore
more costly to operate. As a result, air carriers may not be inclined to buy jets with
engines that reduce noise but may be more expensive to operate.
Q4b. Should  NASA  be  playing  a  bigger  role  in  this  area,  as  it  did  in  its  previous

innovative aircraft engine technology development programs?

A4b. It  would  be  useful  for  NASA  to  conduct  the  type  of  intermediate  R&D  and
demonstration projects that NASA previously conducted and that will be needed for
the NextGen program. NASA, however, is now focusing on longer-term fundamental
research  on  noise  and  emissions  and  its  current  aeronautics  research  budget  is
about  half  of  what  it  was  in  the  mid-1990s.  Moreover,  the  budget  request  for  aero-
nautics  R&D  for  fiscal  year  2009  is  $447  million,  or  about  25  percent  less  than  the
$594  million  provided  in  fiscal  year  2007.  Nonetheless,  according  to  NASA,  about
$280 million of the proposed $447 million would contribute to NextGen. In addition,
according  to  NASA  officials,  a  significant  portion  of  the  funding  for  subsonic  fixed-
wing  aircraft  is  directed  toward  emissions-related  research,  and  many  other  re-
search efforts contribute directly or indirectly to potential emissions-reduction tech-
nologies.
Q5. In your February report to the Subcommittee, you indicated that noise reduction
technologies  may  be  limited  by  concerns  about  global  warming  as  advances  in
these  technologies  could  make  it  more  difficult  to  also  achieve  reductions  in

1 H.R. 2881, 110th Cong. § 505 (2007).

emissions of greenhouse gases. Is GAO saying that reductions in noise and emis-
sions are mutually exclusive or could high fuel prices spur technological innova-
tions we have yet to envision?

A5. I do not think that efforts to achieve reductions in noise and emissions are mu-
tually exclusive, but finding the right balance between them does pose a significant
challenge  for  the  partner  agencies  and  private  stakeholders.  It  is  technologically
challenging  to  design  aircraft  that  can  reduce  one  environmental  concern  without
increasing  another.  Since  the  aviation  industry  must  consider  economic  as  well  as
environmental concerns, research must consider the trade-offs between noise reduc-
tion,  emissions  reduction,  and  fuel  economy.  Engine  technology  has  been  relatively
successful  in  increasing  fuel  efficiency,  reducing  most  types  of  emissions,  and  low-
ering  noise,  but  has  not  been  able  to  achieve  comparable  reductions  in  nitrogen
oxide (NOΧ), which is a primary source of local air pollution. NOΧ has increased be-
cause new engines operate at higher temperatures, producing more power with less
fuel  and  lower  carbon  dioxide  and  carbon  monoxide  emissions,  but  also  producing
higher NOΧ levels, especially at takeoff and landing when engine power settings are
at their highest.
Q6. The  JPDO  was  established  to  plan  and  coordinate  the  R&D  for  NextGen.  You
testified  that  the  three  key  planning  documents  have  been  developed  and  that
JPDO  has  been  pretty  much  absorbed  into  the  Air  Traffic  Organization  (ATO).
How  long  do  you  think  the  JPDO  ought  to  continue  to  exist  and  what  would
it do?

A6. JPDO was established to plan and coordinate the development of NextGen and
should  exist  for  the  duration  of  those  tasks.  JPDO  has  developed  the  key  planning
documents  for  NextGen,  but  further  iterations  of  these  documents  will  be  needed
as  NextGen  technologies  are  developed  and  implemented.  For  example,  JPDO  offi-
cials  expect  to  issue  annual  revisions  to  the  IWP.  JPDO  also  has  a  central  role  in
coordinating and facilitating the NextGen activities of the partner agencies. For ex-
ample, JPDO serves as the principal point of contact with OMB in coordinating the
multi-agency  budgets  for  NextGen,  and  its  working  groups  facilitate  coordination
with  industry  stakeholders.  If  JPDO  ceased  to  exist,  another  entity  would  have  to
assume responsibility for these planning and coordinating activities.

JPDO’s  role  could  evolve  to  include  additional  coordination  and  oversight  activi-
ties.  For  example,  JPDO  could  establish  a  program  oversight  capacity  that  would
enable  it  to  perform  such  functions  as  (1)  coordinating  the  R&D,  systems-engineer-
ing,  and  integration  activities  of  the  partner  agencies  and  industry;  (2)  overseeing
multi-agency  projects;  (3)  overseeing,  with  FAA,  the  selection  of  products  or  out-
comes  of  R&D  that  would  be  moved  to  the  next  stage  of  a  demonstration  project
through  the  Joint  Resources  Council  (JRC);2 (4)  overseeing  the  fundamental  re-
search  activities  that  support  the  long-term  strategic  investments  of  NextGen  by
managing  a  portfolio  of  research  conducted  by  NASA,  academia,  federally  funded
R&D  centers,  and  industry;  and  (5)  maintaining  a  modeling  and  simulation  capa-
bility for testing and evaluating alternative NextGen concepts that provide input to
such oversight.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. With  the  upcoming  change  in  Administrations,  do  you  foresee  difficulties  main-
taining  program  continuity  during  the  transition?  Does  NextGen  have  enough
traction  among  its  partner  agencies  to  maintain  momentum  in  the  months
ahead?

A1. There  is  a  risk  that  the  upcoming  change  in  Administration  will  contribute  to
difficulties in maintaining continuity for NextGen. As FAA begins to implement new
systems  and  transition  to  NextGen,  it  is  possible  that  other  demands  of  a  new  Ad-
ministration  will  compete  for  the  attention  of  FAA’s  senior  leadership.  Moreover,
FAA,  which  currently  has  an  Acting  Administrator,  and  its  partner  agencies  face
the  loss  of  today’s  leaders  as  the  new  Administration  makes  its  own  appointments.
Although  FAA  has  implemented  many  of  the  financial,  management,  and  acquisi-
tion improvements in recent years that will be needed for the transition to NextGen,
FAA’s  new  leaders  will  need  to  sustain  this  commitment  to  provide  a  firm  founda-
tion for continuing to implement NextGen.

2 FAA’s Joint Resources Council establishes and manages acquisition program baselines which
define cost, schedule, performance, and benefit parameters for programs over their full life cycle.

136

It  remains  to  be  seen  whether  NextGen  has  enough  traction  with  JPDO,  FAA,
and  the  other  partner  agencies  to  maintain  momentum  in  the  coming  months.
JPDO,  however,  has  established  some  practices  that  are  important  to  institutional-
izing collaboration among the partner agencies. For example, a memorandum of un-
derstanding,  signed  by  the  Secretary  or  another  high-ranking  official  from  each
partner agency, defines the partner agencies’ roles and responsibilities. In addition,
some NextGen goals and activities have been incorporated in the agencies’ key plan-
ning documents such as FAA’s NextGen Implementation Plan, and JPDO and OMB
have  developed  a  process  for  identifying  NextGen-related  research  projects  in  the
partner agencies’ budgets. Nonetheless, this is a complex multifaceted, multi-decade
project and the partner agencies’ participation in NextGen can be expected to evolve
and  vary  over  time  as  its  requirements  change  and  agencies’  mission  priorities
change.
Q2. JPDO  is  a  planning  and  coordinating  body  that  relies  on  the  cooperation  of  its
federal  partners  to  provide  the  expertise  and  resources  needed  to  accomplish
NextGen.  With  slightly  more  than  four  years  of  experience,  how  would  you  rate
the effectiveness of the JPDO, especially with regard to engaging and sustaining
the  cooperation  of  the  participating  federal  agencies?  What  concerns,  if  any,  do
you have about JPDO’s effectiveness following the reorganization?

A2. JPDO  has  made  progress  in  obtaining  the  cooperation  of  participating  federal
agencies,  but  the  extent  of  participation  has  varied.  Interagency  partnerships  ma-
ture  slowly  because  it  takes  time  to  forge  working  relationships  and  establish  ac-
countability.  While  FAA  and  NASA  have  been  the  most  involved  in  the  planning
and coordination of NextGen, the other agencies are also participating. The Depart-
ment  of  Defense,  for  example,  is  transferring  to  NextGen  the  technology  it  has  de-
veloped for sharing information across networks, establishing an office to coordinate
its  NextGen  activities,  and  collaborating  with  FAA  and  the  Department  of  Com-
merce to develop and implement NextGen’s weather forecasting capability. The De-
partment of Homeland Security is participating by contributing ‘‘in-kind’’ services in
the form of personnel and research. Furthermore, JPDO has been successful in help-
ing  to  establish  mechanisms  to  sustain  cooperation  among  the  participating  federal
agencies.  In  June  2008,  a  memorandum  of  understanding  was  signed  by  the  Sec-
retary  or  another  high-ranking  official  from  each  partner  agency,  defining  each
agency’s role and responsibilities. In addition, as part of the annual budget request,
JPDO  prepares  an  Exhibit  300  form  for  NextGen,  which  allows  JPDO  to  present
OMB  with  a  joint  business  case  for  the  partner  agencies’  NextGen-related  efforts.3
This  business  case  is  used  as  input  to  funding  decisions  for  NextGen  research  and
acquisitions across the agencies.

Since ATO was reorganized in May 2008, JPDO has been housed within the new
NextGen  and  Operations  Planning  Office  and  the  JPDO  Director  reports  through
the Senior Vice President for NextGen and Operations Planning to ATO’s Chief Op-
erating  Officer.  Previously,  the  JPDO  Director  reported  directly  to  both  the  Chief
Operating Officer and the FAA Administrator. Now that JPDO is no longer a sepa-
rate,  independent  office  within  FAA  and  its  head  no  longer  reports  directly  to  the
FAA  Administrator,  its  organizational  position  within  FAA  has  declined.  This  reor-
ganization does not address the concerns of some industry stakeholders that JPDO’s
reporting  status  might  keep  it  from  interacting  on  an  equal  footing  with  ATO  and
the  other  partner  federal  agencies.  In  2007,  we  reported  that  it  was  important  for
JPDO  to  have  some  independence  from  ATO  to  counter  the  perception  that  it  was
a  proxy  for  ATO  and,  as  such,  not  able  to  act  as  an  ‘‘honest  broker’’  between  ATO
and  the  partner  federal  agencies.  We  pointed  out  that,  to  address  this  issue,  the
JPDO Director could report directly to the FAA Administrator.4 Nonetheless, we be-
lieve  it  is  too  early  to  tell  whether  the  reorganization  has  diminished  the  effective-
ness of JPDO, especially in terms of its ability to sustain the cooperation of the part-
ner  federal  agencies,  or  if  the  new  governance  structure  will  be  acceptable  in  prac-
tice  and  address  the  concerns  that  have  been  raised.  Ultimately,  the  effectiveness
of  JPDO  will  have  to  be  measured  by  the  efforts  of  the  partner  agencies  to  imple-
ment  policies  and  procedures,  conduct  research,  and  acquire  systems  that  support
NextGen.

Q3. The  Automatic  Dependent  Surveillance–Broadcast  (ADS–B)  program  is  funda-
mental  to  NextGen.  What  are  the  major  risks  with  ADS–B  in  terms  of  capabili-
ties, schedule, cost, and industry acceptance?

A3. ADS–B  is  a  satellite-based  aircraft  navigation  system  that  allows  aircraft  to
broadcast their position to air traffic controllers, other aircraft, and ground systems.
FAA  plans  to  implement  ADS–B  over  the  next  15  to  20  years  as  a  key  NextGen
system.  FAA  awarded  a  contract  worth  up  to  $1.8  billion  for  acquiring  the  ground
infrastructure for ADS–B in August 2007 and is developing an ADS–B rule-making,
scheduled for issuance in 2010. FAA’s initial deployment plans focus on areas of the
Nation that do not have radar surveillance, such as Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico,
and  individual  airlines,  such  as  United  Parcel  Service,  which  is  installing  ADS–B
on all of its Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft.

Several  risks  are  associated  with  implementing  ADS–B  including  the  cost  to  in-
dustry to equip, incomplete specifications for ADS–B capabilities, and broadcast fre-
quency congestion concerns. Full use of ADS–B depends not only on government ef-
forts,  but  also  involves  decisions  by  the  aviation  industry  about  what  equipment  to
purchase and when to purchase it. With ADS–B, for example, an official of RTCA’s5
ADS–B  working  group  noted  that  the  cost  and  expected  benefits  of  equipping  air-
craft  to  take  full  advantage  of  ADS–B  is  a  key  issue  for  the  aviation  industry.  The
official  said  that  equipping  existing  aircraft  to  communicate  with  the  ground  sta-
tions may not be cost prohibitive for regional and large commercial airlines, but fur-
ther equipping these aircraft so they can use ADS–B’s full capabilities could require
cost-prohibitive  modifications.  Consequently,  the  official  noted  that  carriers  plan  to
install  equipment  to  use  ADS–B’s  full  capabilities  only  as  they  order  new  aircraft.
He also said that carriers could have full-capability ADS–B installed on new aircraft
that  they  are  ordering  now,  except  that  specifications  do  not  yet  exist.  In  addition,
the  official  believed  that  some  air  carriers  were  hesitant  to  equip  with  ADS–B  be-
cause  of  concerns  that  FAA  might  not  follow  through  with  the  deployment  of  full
ADS–B  capabilities.  We  have  reported6 that  a  demonstration  of  NextGen  capabili-
ties, such as ADS–B, and of efficiencies resulting from their use would give airlines
an  incentive  to  equip  their  aircraft  with  NextGen  technologies.  They  could  then
lower  their  costs  by  reducing  their  fuel  consumption  and  decrease  the  impact  of
their  operations  on  the  environment.  Our  research  indicates  that  by  establishing
benefits  early  in  a  program’s  development,  demonstrations  can  increase  stake-
holders’ confidence in an initiative. A demonstration of ADS–B could provide incen-
tives for the aviation community to equip aircraft with compatible technology.

In  addition,  concerns  have  been  raised  about  broadcast  frequency  congestion  re-
lated  to  ADS–B.  FAA  plans  to  establish  two  data  links  for  the  system.  Commercial
aircraft  and  other  aircraft  operating  at  high  altitudes  would  send  their  position  to
ground stations by transmitting on 1090 MHz while general aviation would use Uni-
versal  Access  Transceivers  operating  on  978  MHz.  On  September  26,  2008,  FAA’s
ADS–B  Aviation  Rule-making  Committee  called  for  an  urgent  study  of  congestion
on  1090  MHz,  indicating  the  frequency  is  becoming  crowded  in  some  airspace  with
high-density air traffic.

Question submitted by Representative Laura Richardson
Q1. In your testimony you referenced closing and consolidating systems, what do you

mean?

A1. To fully realize NextGen’s capabilities, FAA will have to reconfigure its air traf-
fic control (ATC) facilities to make them compatible with new technologies and pro-
cedures.  According  to  a  senior  ATO  official,  the  agency  plans  to  report  on  the  cost
implications of reconfiguring its facilities in 2009. However, FAA has no comprehen-
sive  plan  for  reconfiguring  its  facilities.  Until  the  cost  analysis  is  completed  and  a
reconfiguration  plan  has  been  developed,  the  configurations  needed  for  NextGen
cannot  be  implemented  and  potential  savings  that  could  help  offset  the  cost  of
NextGen will not be realized. Some FAA officials have said that implementing plans
for facility maintenance and construction that are based on the current ATC system
and do not incorporate the configurations needed for NextGen could, without recon-

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Calvin  L.  Scovel  III,  Inspector  General,  U.S.  Department  of  Transpor-

tation

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. In your statement, you recount FAA’s difficulties in implementing the Standard
Terminal  Automation  Replacement  System  (STARS)  program.  You  say  that  the
original  program  for  172  sites  costing  $940  million  became  one  for  just  50  sites
costing  $1.46  billion.  So  let’s  look  at  the  math.  We  reduce  the  number  of  sites
by two-thirds and pay 50 percent more. Why should such a performance by FAA
give  the  Congress  any  confidence  that  NextGen  won’t  suffer  the  same  cost  prob-
lems?

A1. FAA  modernization  projects,  including  STARS,  have  a  long  history  of  cost
growth,  schedule  slips,  and  performance  shortfalls.  These  problems  have  translated
into reduced benefits to FAA and airspace users, reliance on costly interim systems,
and  loss  of  confidence  in  FAA’s  ability  to  manage  large-scale  acquisitions.  As  we
have  noted  in  reports  and  testimonies,  it  will  be  important  for  FAA  to  avoid  these
problems in developing various NextGen efforts.

The  development  and  implementation  of  NextGen  is  a  high-risk  effort  that  will
require sustained oversight. It will be a top management challenge for the next Ad-
ministration.  To  help  reduce  risk  with  NextGen,  we  have  made  several  rec-
ommendations to FAA, including the following:

• Reporting  NextGen  costs  to  Congress  and  stakeholders  along  three  vectors,
which  include  developmental  efforts,  adjustments  to  existing  projects,  and
NextGen implementation.
• Determining  what  skill  sets  and  expertise  with  respect  to  software  develop-
ment, contract oversight, and systems integration that will be needed to man-
age NextGen.
• Funding  targeted  human  factors  research  to  ensure  that  the  changes  envi-
• Developing and reporting on a new set of metrics for measuring progress with
NextGen initiatives that focus on the delivery of a new capability with respect
to  enhancing  capacity,  boosting  productivity,  or  reducing  Agency  operating
costs.
• Developing an interim architecture for the 2015 timeframe to help bridge the

sioned for pilots and controllers can be safely accommodated.

gap between current systems and NextGen.

FAA has concurred with these recommendations and is taking action. We will con-

tinue to monitor FAA’s efforts in these areas.
Q2. How successful has the JPDO been developing conceptual and technical descrip-
tions  of  what  NextGen  will  consist  of?  How  about  in  developing  a  plan  for  the
coordinated implementation of a transformed future system?

A2. The  JPDO  has  been  successful  in  developing  conceptual  and  technical  descrip-
tions of NextGen. These are outlined in the NextGen Concept of Operations and In-
tegrated  Work  Plan.  JPDO  plans  call  for  a  system  that  relies  heavily  on  satellite-
based systems, data link communications for pilots and controllers, new automation
systems,  and  robust  and  secure  information  sharing.  However,  planning  documents
remain at a very high level and are unconstrained and not mature enough to trans-
late into specific requirements for new automation or data link communication sys-
tems.

The JPDO has not been successful thus far in developing a coordinated implemen-
tation  plan  for  NextGen.  FAA  and  the  JPDO  have  much  work  to  do  to  develop  a
realistic transition plan for Congress and airspace users. This is important because
NextGen will require airspace users to purchase and install a wide range of avionics
at an estimated cost of $15 billion. This is why we believe FAA needs to assess ‘‘im-
plementation  bandwidth’’  to  determine  what  reasonably  can  be  accomplished  with
respect to equipage as well as controller and pilot training in given timeframes.
Q3. Your statement characterizes the JPDO foundational documents such as the En-
terprise  Architecture  as  not  yet  mature  enough  to  drive  investment  decisions  or
generate requirements for major NextGen acquisitions. You said that JPDO offi-
cials  told  your  office  that  it  will  take  a  year  or  more  for  the  documents  to  be
effective  tools  for  driving  agency  budgets,  setting  priorities,  and  managing  re-
search efforts.

a. In your opinion, is JPDO’s response reasonable?
b. Should we expect these foundational documents to take time to mature as ad-

vocated by the JPDO?

c. Does this further complicate the research that needs to be done?

A3. As we noted in our statement, some progress has been made with key NextGen
foundational  documents,  such  as  the  NextGen  Enterprise  Architecture  and  Inte-
grated  Work  Plan.  However,  they  remain  at  a  high  level  and,  as  FAA  points  out,
are  unconstrained  with  respect  to  cost.  As  was  noted  by  the  National  Research
Council, these efforts reflect a lack of top-level system engineering and clearly estab-
lished priorities. We agree with the National Research Council’s assessment.

FAA’s  statements  that  it  will  take  a  year  or  more  for  the  planning  documents  to
mature enough to drive investment decision, set priorities, and manage research ap-
pear  reasonable.  It  is  an  unfortunate  but  accurate  assessment  of  progress  to  date.
We  recognize  that  many  stakeholders  are  frustrated  by  a  lack  of  progress  with  the
NextGen Enterprise Architecture and overall efforts to move forward with NextGen.
Therefore,  we  believe  that  FAA  should  take  steps  to  accelerate  these  efforts  where
possible.

We  note  that  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  these  documents  to  take  time  to  mature
and  be  modified  as  NextGen  concepts  and  requirements  are  more  clearly  defined.
Further,  these  documents  will  have  to  be  adjusted  to  reflect  the  results  of  ongoing
research projects.

Without  question,  the  lack  of  maturity  of  the  NextGen  Enterprise  Architecture
and Integrated Work Plan complicate the execution of research needed for NextGen.
We  think  FAA  and  the  JPDO  need  to  establish  research  priorities  to  help  decision-
makers  understand  which  investments  need  to  be  made  first  from  the  wide  range
of  operational  improvements  discussed  in  planning  documents.  As  noted  in  our
statement,  FAA  should  provide  this  Committee  with  a  clear  understanding  of  how
it  will  prioritize  research  and  development,  address  various  research  gaps,  and  up-
date  priorities  when  research  results  become  available  or  when  national  priorities
change.
Q4. Your office recommended earlier this year that FAA develop an interim architec-
ture  or  ‘‘waypoint’’  that  is  manageable  and  executable  for  what  is  expected  in
2015.  The  OIG  report  says  that  FAA  concurred  with  this  recommendation.
Please describe the key attributes that would make this interim architecture both
manageable and executable.

A4. We  recommended  that  FAA  develop  an  interim  architecture  in  the  2015  time-
frame  to  reduce  risk  and  help  bridge  the  gap  between  the  current  system  and  the
vastly  different  NextGen.  This  interim  architecture  should  have  a  number  of  at-
tributes to help make it manageable and executable.

First,  the  interim  architecture  should  clearly  define  the  expected  benefits  for
stakeholders  and  FAA.  Currently,  FAA  does  not  articulate  the  expected  benefits  of
NextGen  investments  in  planning  or  budget  documents.  The  benefits  should  focus
on enhancing capacity and reducing delays and operating costs.

Second,  the  interim  architecture  should  show  a  clear  path  for  how  existing  sys-
tems will transition to NextGen and identify what adjustments will be needed. This
is  important  because  over  30  existing  systems  form  platforms  for  NextGen.  Thus,
the  pace  of  NextGen  will  be  dictated  by  progress  with  existing  systems.  An  inte-
grated approach to software development and integration will be essential to reduce
the potential for cost growth, schedule delays, and shifting requirements.

Third,  the  interim  architecture  should  highlight  and  publish  the  timeframes  for
making  the  procedural  changes  needed  to  get  the  expected  benefits  from  new  sys-
tems  or  a  combination  of  systems.  For  example,  FAA  will  need  to  make  sure  that
new  procedures  that  rely  on  data  link  communications  for  controllers  and  pilots,
new routes that rely on on-board aircraft avionics, and new automation capabilities
for boosting capacity are in place at specific locations.
Q5. What is the impact of FAA’s reorganization on the NextGen development and im-
plementation  effort?  Can  you  elaborate  on  what  you  characterize  in  your  state-
ment as ‘‘friction’’ between the ATO and JPDO?

A5. As  stated  in  our  testimony,  it  is  too  soon  to  evaluate  FAA’s  recent  reorganiza-
tion  on  NextGen  development  and  implementation.  While  FAA  believes  the  change
will help with implementation, it gives the appearance that the JPDO has been sig-
nificantly reduced in stature and importance. We do have some concerns that could
impact NextGen implementation.

141

• First, the roles and responsibilities of the JPDO and ATO are not clearly de-
fined.  According  to  FAA,  the  JPDO  will  focus  on  long-term  planning  and
interagency  cooperation  while  the  ATO’s  new  NextGen  Implementation  office
will concentrate on short-term efforts. However, it will be difficult to establish
clear  demarcation  lines  because  implementing  NextGen  capabilities  depend
heavily on modifying existing modernization projects. In addition, both offices
will  have  considerable  modeling  and  simulation  capabilities  for  assessing
NextGen initiatives.
• Second,  while  the  Senior  Vice  President  for  NextGen  will  be  responsible  for
managing  NextGen  demonstration  projects,  major  efforts  for  essential
NextGen  platforms,  such  as  ERAM  and  Terminal  Modernization,  will  con-
tinue  to  be  managed  by  other  ATO  vice  presidents.  We  also  note  that  air-
ports—which play a key role in NextGen—are managed by an FAA office out-
side of the ATO. Thus, budgetary authority for FAA modernization efforts re-
mains fragmented.
• Third,  the  new  structure  will  be  challenged  to  deal  with  complex,  cross-cut-
ting agency issues that will need to be resolved. For example, we think it will
be  difficult  for  an  office  within  the  ATO  to  work  out  agreements  with  DOD,
DHS,  or  NOAA  on  major  decisions  affecting  surveillance,  airspace  security,
and weather systems.

Further,  there  has  been—and  continues  to  be—friction  between  the  ATO  and
JPDO that is due in part to vastly different planning horizons. The ATO is an orga-
nization  that  operates  the  National  Airspace  System  24  hours  a  day,  seven  days  a
week. The ATO does this very well but it has a short planning horizon. The JPDO,
on  the  other  hand,  is  focused  on  introducing  cutting-edge  technologies  and  trans-
forming  the  National  Airspace  System  by  the  2025  timeframe.  It  will  be  important
to reconcile these differences to successfully implement NextGen.
Q6. You  indicated  in  your  statement  that  FAA  needs  to  focus  attention  on  airport
issues  and  how  NextGen  technologies  can  unlock  already  congested  airports.
Can  you  elaborate  on  how  FAA  would  do  that  and  how  it  differs  from  that  al-
ready accomplished in it’s planning documents?

A6. A  top  priority  for  NextGen  should  focus  on  enhancing  capacity  at  already  con-
gested  metropolitan  areas,  such  as  the  New  York  airports.  An  important  metric  for
NextGen  is  to  what  extent  efforts  can  increase  airport  arrival  rates  under  various
weather conditions.

Currently,  FAA  planning  documents  and  budget  requests  do  not  detail  how  indi-
vidual  NextGen  efforts  can  specifically  increase  airport  arrival  rates  and  thereby
boost  capacity.  It  would  help  decision-makers  and  stakeholders  if  FAA  would  show
how  individual  NextGen  efforts;  like  Automatic  Dependent  Surveillance–Broadcast,
data  link  communications  for  controllers  and  pilots,  and  new  ground  automation
systems;  can  boost  airport  capacity.  This  information  will  help  target  solutions  to
specific  airports,  set  expectations,  and  help  shape  consensus  among  stakeholders
about how to move forward with NextGen.
Q7. In  response  to  a  question  from  Ranking  Member  Hall  on  OMB’s  coordination
and  alignment  of  research  budgets  among  participating  federal  agencies,  you
noted the ‘‘great’’ difference between the budget request submitted by the Depart-
ment  of  Commerce  for  NOAA  on  weather  capabilities  and  what  FAA  had  ex-
pected.  What  was  the  magnitude  of  the  difference  and  what  was  the  basis  for
FAA’s expectation?

A7. The Department of Commerce has the lead role in developing the 4–D Weather
Cube,  which  is  expected  to  provide  a  single  authoritative  source  for  weather  obser-
vations  and  analysis.  This  tool  is  also  expected  to  provide  a  common  picture  of
weather  for  all  airspace  users.  However,  there  are  significant  differences  between
FAA and NOAA regarding how new weather systems will be used.

An internal JPDO assessment found that there is disagreement on synchronizing
weather  observations,  forecasts,  and  dissemination  efforts.  This  threatens  current
plans to implement the 4–D Weather Cube in the 2013 timeframe. The assessment
also  noted  that  several  policy  and  funding  issues  need  to  be  addressed;  specifically,
most  of  the  Department  of  Commerce  efforts  that  the  JPDO  expects  to  rely  on  are
not funded.

Development for the 4–D Weather Cube is estimated to cost more than $300 mil-
lion  and  implementation  costs,  though  uncertain,  have  been  estimated  at  three
times  as  much  as  to  develop  the  cube.  It  is  difficult  to  assess  FAA’s  expectations
because  the  Agency  has  not  finalized  NextGen  weather-related  requirements.  FAA
and  Commerce  are  working  to  resolve  issues  and  reach  some  level  of  agreement  in

142

time for the FY 2010 budget submission. The development of the 4D Weather Cube,
funding  levels,  and  the  evolution  of  requirements  will  require  sustained  oversight.
Q8. In your statement, you note FAA’s difficulties with its ADS–B Notice of Proposed
Rule-making  and  call  on  FAA  to  ‘‘develop  a  realistic  plan  for  implementing
ADS–B and realizing the air-to-air benefits of the technology.’’
a. What are the components of a realistic plan?
b. Do the air-to-air benefits you have in mind require both ADS–B ‘‘out’’ and ‘‘in’’

capabilities?

A8. A top priority for the next Administration will be developing a realistic plan for
implementing  ADS–B.  Currently,  there  is  no  consensus  regarding  how  to  move  for-
ward with ADS–B.

The  elements  of  a  realistic  plan  for  ADS–B  include  a  clear,  lucid  articulation  of
requirements, benefits, and costs for airspace users to purchase and install new avi-
onics.  This  plan  should  also  include  milestones  for  completing  a  number  of  critical
efforts, including the following:

• Modifying existing controller automation systems.
• Finalizing technical requirements for ADS–B ‘‘Out’’ and ADS–B ‘‘In.’’
• Certifying ADS–B related equipment on the aircraft in the United States.
• Approving separation standards for using ADS–B to manage traffic.
• Completing controller training programs for relying on ADS–B systems.

The  air-to-air  benefits  of  ADS–B  are  significant  but  rely  on  both  ADS–B  ‘‘Out’’
and ADS–B ‘‘In.’’ FAA’s proposed rule only mandates ADS–B ‘‘Out,’’ or the broadcast
of  information  to  ground  systems.  The  potential  for  ADS–B  ‘‘In’’  relies  on  the  fact
that  information  on  nearby  aircraft  will  be  delivered  to  the  cockpit.  This  gives  the
pilot  a  second  set  of  eyes,  thereby  enhancing  situational  awareness  and  safety  in
the  air  and  on  the  ground.  Therefore,  we  believe  FAA  needs  to  accelerate  efforts  to
finalize requirements for ADS–B ‘‘In.’’

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. With  upcoming  change  in  Administrations,  do  you  foresee  difficulties  maintain-
ing  program  continuity  during  the  transition?  Does  NextGen  have  enough  trac-
tion among participating agencies to maintain momentum in the months ahead?
A1. It  will  be  a  challenge  to  maintain  program  continuity  during  the  upcoming
transition.  This  is  the  case  for  major  initiatives  across  the  Federal  Government.  In
our  forthcoming  report  on  the  top  management  challenges  facing  the  department,
we  will  highlight  the  importance  of  managing  and  reducing  risk  with  NextGen.  It
will  be  important  for  FAA  and  the  JPDO  to  complete  several  actions,  including  es-
tablishing funding priorities for NextGen.

To maintain traction with NextGen and continue cooperation among JPDO’s part-
ner  agencies,  the  next  Administration  will  have  to  emphasize  its  commitment  to  a
multi-agency  approach.  This  will  be  important  given  the  cross-cutting  nature  of
NextGen,  resource  constraints  facing  the  government,  and  the  expected  sharp  com-
petition for funds. As noted in our statement, much work remains to be done to fully
link  and  integrate  agency  budgets  and  address  research  gaps  for  the  development
and execution of NextGen.
Q2. The joint Planning and Development Office is a planning and coordinating body
that relies on the cooperation of its federal partners to provide the expertise and
resources  needed  to  accomplish  NextGen.  With  slightly  more  than  four  years  of
experience, how would you rate the effectiveness of the JPDO, especially with re-
gard  to  engaging  and  sustaining  the  cooperation  of  participating  federal  agen-
cies? What concerns, if any, do you have about the JPDO’s effectiveness following
the reorganization?

A2. The  JPDO  has  been  effective  in  engaging  and  cooperating  with  participating
agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the De-
partment of Defense. The JPDO’s efforts to leverage research at other federal agen-
cies  are  critical  given  that  FAA  conducts  very  little  long-term  air  traffic  manage-
ment research.

Central  to  making  the  JPDO  an  effective  multi-agency  vehicle  is  the  alignment
of  resources.  This  is  a  complex  task,  and  the  JPDO  has  no  authority  to  adjust  or
direct the research efforts of other federal agencies.

As  noted  in  our  statement,  we  have  seen  progress  with  various  mechanisms  of
alignment,  including  the  publication  of  a  NextGen  Concept  of  Operations  and
NextGen  Research  and  Development  Plan.  However,  FAA  and  the  JPDO  partner
agencies need to address several fundamental issues to ensure that research efforts
are aligned and successfully transferred to the NAS. For example, there are 27 ‘‘dis-
connects’’  or  ‘‘gaps’’  that  need  to  be  addressed,  which  will  fundamentally  affect  the
cost and schedule for NextGen. We provide details on these issues in our statement.
It  is  premature  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  recent  organizational  changes
that  places  the  JPDO  within  the  FAA  Air  Traffic  Organization.  However,  it  gives
the appearance that the JPDO has been reduced in stature and importance. We are
concerned  about  the  fragmentation  of  budget  authority  and  accountability  as  well
as  how  the  new  organization  will  deal  with  cross-cutting  agency  issues.  We  think
FAA  will  have  to  revisit  how  the  Agency  is  organized  once  it  has  a  clearer  picture
of what it will take to deliver NextGen capabilities.
Q3. The ADS–B program is fundamental to NextGen. What are the major risks with

ADS–B in terms of capabilities, schedule, cost, and industry acceptance?

A3. The  implementation  of  ADS–B  and  cockpit  displays  offer  significant  potential
to  enhance  safety  and  boost  capacity.  However,  the  introduction  of  this  technology
faces the following risks.

• Stakeholder  acceptance  and  aircraft  equipage—FAA  plans  to  mandate  ADS–
B  but  unresolved  questions  exist  about  the  cost  of  new  avionics  and  the  lack
of benefits.
• Frequency  congestion  concerns—There  are  real  concerns  that  the  frequency
planned  for  large  commercial  aircraft  will  become  over  crowded.  This  is  par-
ticularly  a  concern  for  high  activity  airspace  in  the  Northeast  United  States.
• Finalizing  requirements  for  ADS–B  and  cockpit  displays—FAA  must  finalize
requirements  for  both  ADS–B  ‘‘Out’’  (the  broadcast  of  information  to  ground
systems) and ADS–B ‘‘In’’ (the display of information in the cockpit).
• Integrating  ADS–B  with  existing  systems—FAA  must  successfully  integrate
ADS–B  with  existing  controller  displays  and  computers  across  the  National
Airspace System.
• Addressing security concerns—Because ADS–B could make the position of air-
craft  generally  available,  security  risks  need  to  be  fully  explored  and  miti-
gated.

FAA  published  a  notice  of  proposed  rule-making  for  ADS–B  in  October  2007  and
received over 170 comments from organizations or individuals. FAA is reviewing the
comments  and  working  with  industry  to  resolve  several  complex  issues  and  risks.
We plan to issue a report on ADS–B early next year.

Question submitted by Representative Laura Richardson
Q1. Has the gap analysis been conducted that you referenced on April 14, 2008?
A1. FAA  is  conducting  the  gap  analysis  as  recommended  in  our  April  14,  2008,  re-
port. According to FAA officials, the analysis of ‘‘gaps’’ between current systems and
NextGen is expected to be completed by February 2009. We will continue to monitor
FAA’s efforts in this area.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Paul G. Kaminski, Chairman and CEO, Technovation, Inc.; AIA Mem-

ber of NextGen Institute Management Committee

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. How  challenging  is  the  JPDO’s  role  in  consolidating  and  focusing  the  research
and  development  work  of  so  many  agencies  without  having  budgetary  control
over their work? How does this compare with your experience at DOD?

A1. From  my  experience,  I  know  how  challenging  budgetary  control  issues  can  be,
and  this  is  especially  so  with  a  multi-agency  endeavor  such  as  JPDO.  Each  JPDO
partner  agency  has  its  own  executive  mission,  and  I  doubt  that—given  JPDO  ac-
tions  to  date—providing  direct  JPDO  budgetary  authority  over  partner  agencies’
R&D is realistic. However, some level of oversight of participating agencies budgets
for  NextGen  R&D  to  support  the  critically  needed  planning,  system  engineering,
and integration of R&D efforts might be helpful.
Q2. In  the  transformed  NextGen,  I  understand  that  roles  and  responsibilities  of  key
players  will  change  dramatically.  Pilots  will  take  more  separation  responsibil-
ities  and  automation  will  enable  air  traffic  controllers  to  manage  larger  num-
bers of aircraft while improving safety.

A2. Reallocation  of  airborne  and  ground  responsibilities  is  an  issue  that  FAA  had
anticipated,  and  it  directed  its  efforts  accordingly.  One  factor  in  this  is  the  extent
of equipage which will determine where, when, and how responsibility will be dele-
gated. Pilots and controllers have to be consulted and trained for their new missions
involving  new  technology  and  new  approaches  to  improve  efficiency  and  safety.
There  will  also  be  new  responsibilities  in  a  world  of  substantially  different  aircraft
types such as Unmanned Aerial Systems.
Q2a. What  are  the  key  aspects  from  human  factors  research  that  FAA  and  NASA
need to get right before we can have confidence that this delegation of decision-
making duties is both feasible and safe?

A2a. In  support  of  the  relevant  human  factors  research  that  you  raised,  I  believe
that  we  need  to  develop  the  modeling  and  simulation  capabilities  that  I  described
in the briefing attached to my statement. These capabilities will allow us to validate
our models by using live demonstrations, to include ‘‘humans in the loop’’ so we can
validate  operational  performance  in  realistic  environments.  This  will  be  critical  to
development and implementation of the policies and certification standards that are
needed to obtain the efficiency and safety benefits associated with the enhanced au-
tomation enabled by new technology and new system approaches.
Q2b. Are  the  needed  R&D  programs  in  place  and  adequately  funded  to  get  that  re-

search done?

A2b. Many  of  the  R&D  programs  are  in  place.  But  I  believe  additional  programs
are  needed  to  fill  voids  and,  most  importantly,  we  need  a  better  integration  of  our
modeling  and  simulation  capabilities  and  related  demonstrations  across  the  entire
NextGen domain. It will be important for this Committee to review the next budget
for modeling and simulation capabilities in this context.
Q3. You advocate bolstering demonstration with modeling and simulation to gain a
better understanding of benefits and limitations from anticipated technology im-
provements.  Since  FAA  does  not  currently  have  a  significant  indigenous  mod-
eling  and  simulation  capability,  when  do  you  see  the  agency  being  capable  of
performing  such  research?  Or  should  this  research  be  carried  out  by  NASA  or
another entity?

A3. FAA,  as  the  implementing  agency  that  does  near-  and  mid-term  planning,
should direct and coordinate NextGen modeling and simulation activities, and over-
see  the  validation  of  models  and  simulations  with  demonstrations.  From  my  ex-
tended  and  ongoing  discussions  with  FAA,  the  agency  officials  are  very  aware  of
current limitations in this arena. There is extensive modeling and simulation capa-
bility  at  the  FAA  Technical  Center  in  Atlantic  City.  I  have  met  with  the  Director
of that facility, and look forward to making a visit in the near-term to obtain a bet-
ter  understanding  of  the  capabilities  and  limitations.  NASA  also  has  capabilities
which  should  be  exploited.  Representing  AIA,  I  am  continuing  to  explore  ways  to
assist FAA’s expansion and refinement of its capabilities (both internally and exter-
nally)  by  working  with  NASA,  DOD,  and  industry.  The  briefing  that  I  provided

along  with  my  statement  outlines  the  approach  which  I  believe  is  needed  both  to
execute  the  development  and  implementation  of  NextGen  and  to  exploit  the  sub-
stantial  long-term  benefits  that  can  be  provided  to  the  Nation.  Accelerating
NextGen  applications  is  the  goal,  and  my  proposal  would  enhance  current  FAA  ef-
forts.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. With  the  upcoming  change  in  Administration,  do  you  foresee  difficulties  main-
taining  program  continuity  during  the  transaction?  Does  NextGen  have  enough
traction  among  its  particular  agencies  to  maintain  momentum  in  the  months
ahead?

A1. Since  the  FAA  restructuring  bringing  closer  coordination  with  JPDO,  NextGen
is  now  better  positioned  to  maintain  program  continuity  during  an  Administration
transition. This more efficient integration of JPDO and FAA allows NextGen imple-
mentation  and  near-term  planning  to  be  aligned  with  NextGen  R&D  and  daily  air
traffic  operations  into  a  cohesive  whole.  This  integration  will  effectively  support
FAA—the  implementing  agency—in  its  responsibility  for  meeting  a  challenging
R&D and implementation timetable.

JPDO partner agencies are already working with FAA to leverage applicable R&D
and  facilitate  technology  transfer  in  a  timely  manner.  With  continued  NextGen
near-term  planning  as  it  transitions  to  implementation,  JPDO  participating  agen-
cies  will  be  reassured  by  integration  with  the  implementing  agency  that  will  en-
hance  productivity.  This  closer  FAA  role  will  ensure  that  planning  and  R&D  are
prioritized and directly relevant to near-term operational applications. Additionally,
partner  agencies’  participation  will  be  under  the  rigor  and  structure  of  the  imple-
menting federal agency to ensure planning is productive and relevant, valuable and
appropriate.
Q2. The  Joint  Planning  and  Development  Office  is  a  planning  and  coordinating
body that relies on the cooperation of its federal partners to provide the expertise
and resources needed to accomplish NextGen. With slightly more than four years
of  experience,  how  would  you  rate  the  effectiveness  of  the  JPDO,  especially  with
regard  to  engaging  and  sustaining  the  cooperation  of  the  participating  federal
agencies?  What  concerns,  if  any,  do  you  have  about  JPDO’s  effectiveness  fol-
lowing the reorganization?

A2. The  JPDO  was  tasked  with  an  extremely  challenging  mission  and  has  made  a
start with issuance of the requisite planning documents. However, these documents
do  not  yet  provide  the  level  of  detail  and  the  decision-making  foundation  that  were
expected  and  needed  by  government  and  industry  stakeholders.  Consequently,  we
have  lost  time  and,  aside  from  participating  agencies’  own  planning,  JPDO’s  plan-
ning  needs  more  definition.  External  organizations  that  have  reviewed  JPDO  docu-
ments, such as the National Research Council and the FAA Research, Engineering,
and  Development  Advisory  Committee  (REDAC),  have  expressed  concern  that  the
documents do not sufficiently define R&D for agencies’ action. This concern was am-
plified  by  the  recently  released  JPDO  Integrated  Work  Plan  that  was  officially  re-
characterized  as  a  ‘‘planning  tool,’’  i.e.,  not  a  plan,  and  presented  as  one  of  several
approaches to achieve NextGen. However, it was expected that this document would
integrate  and  direct  NextGen  activities.  Participating  agencies  and  companies  have
been  generally  disappointed  with  JPDO  progress,  with  the  belief  that  their  efforts
have  been  less  than  productive.  JPDO  working  groups,  led  by  government  and  in-
dustry  co-chairs,  have  asked  that  their  work  be  integrated  under  a  unified  lead,  as
most complex development projects are. It was only now, when FAA has been recep-
tive  to  this  request,  that  their  request  may  be  met.  This  is  illustrative  of  the  value
that  can  accrue  to  JPDO’s  efforts  under  closer  coordination  with  FAA:  Industry  be-
lieves  that,  under  closer  FAA  guidance,  it’s  efforts  can  be  integrated  and  directed
by established planning goals.

I would like to remind the Committee that I would be pleased to provide any fur-
ther assistance that could be of value, including an informal presentation of my plan
to accelerate NextGen development and applications.

How to Accelerate NextGen: What needs to be done

To  accelerate  NextGen  implementation,  there  are  clusters  of  essential
modifications that must be realized:

BY DR. PAUL G. KAMINSKI

• NextGen  foundational  programs  need  near-term  demonstrations  linked  with

modeling and simulation, and validated by testing;

• The demonstrations can then be expanded and extended in an integrated en-

vironment;

• We  need  to  begin  now  with  operational  demonstrations  (building  on  existing
FAA Test Beds) with stay-behind capabilities that are then replicated and in-
tegrate; and

• We  need  to  build  an  acquisition  and  system  engineering  base  for  people  to

gain domain experience at test bed demonstration locations.

We  also  need  to  attain  consensus  on  selection  criteria  for  near-term  demonstra-
tions.  I  suggest  criteria  such  as  capacity  enhancement,  energy  efficiency,  improved
safety  and/or  security,  environmental  impact,  implementable  within  the  next  five
years, and a favorable benefit/cost ratio.

The carefully selected demonstrations will provide us with the information to link

foundational programs with enabled NextGen applications and criteria.
Foundational Programs

• ADS–B
• RNP/RNAV
• Surface Management System
• SWIM
• DataComm

Enabled Applications

• CDAs/Tailored Arrivals
• Closely Spaced Parallels
• CDTI assisted approaches

Criteria

• Capacity enhancing
• More energy efficient
• Improved safety/security
• Environmentally sound
• Implementable in the next five years
• Favorable benefit/cost ratio

The  selected  FAA  test  beds  and  demonstrations  will  undergo  the  iterative  cycle
of planning, design and model, build, test and evaluate, adjust, redesign and refine
modeling  and  simulation,  build  more,  integrate  results,  and  then  start  over.  As  I
call it, ‘‘build a little, test a little.’’

A  tested  capability  (capability  ‘‘A’’)  is  established  in  one  location  and  integrated
with another location (after testing). This linkage can be expanded to achieve a stra-
tegic  system  engineering  model  with  a  regionally  linked  capability.  Another  capa-
bility  is  then  added  to  one  location  and  the  same  process  begins  with  the  second
capability, adding it as a second capability layered on top of the first one and linked
regionally.

This  iterative  process  continues,  adding  capabilities,  expanding  the  regional  link-

age, and adding participating users as they see the value of capability equipage.

Appropriate  modeling  and  simulation  is  key  to  accelerating  progress:  it  provides
the  systems  engineering  foundation  needed  to  support  and  integrate  acquisition;  it
helps establish priorities for achieving the best payoff, and helps define policies and
procedures  to  achieve  the  objectives  (energy  and  operational  efficiency,  environ-
mental  improvement,  improved  safety  and  security;  iterative  modeling  and  simula-
tion  enables  systematic  improvements,  promotes  a  common  understanding  of  com-
plex new capabilities, their value added, and mutual interaction; when validated by
testing,  modeling  and  simulation  demonstrate  the  value  proposition  and  link  incre-
mental improvements to the business case; and data from modeling and simulation

supported  by  demonstrations  will  yield  the  rationale  and  business  case  to  replace
unnecessary legacy systems.

There  are  specific  requirements  to  execute  this  acceleration  of  NextGen  capabili-
ties. These requirements are a strategic systems engineering foundation (enabled by
modeling  and  simulation)  to  refine  operational  planning  and  requirements,  set  pri-
orities, develop system specifications, and support deployment planning; systems ac-
quisition  experience  and  discipline  to  enhance  JPDO  planning  and  FAA  implemen-
tation  processes;  systems  acquisition/integration  management  expertise  to  manage
JPDO  working  groups,  and  mature  IWP  and  modeling  &  simulation  architecture;
a  systems  acquisition  manager  under  FAA  ATO/COO  with  subordinate  program
managers for major programs; consortia and individual supporting industry contrac-
tors to implement NextGen (e.g., ADS–B contract consortium); and immediate start
with  operational  demonstrations  of  foundational  technology  programs  with  stay  be-
hind capabilities, which will then be replicated.

In  summary,  as  the  first  step,  we  need  to  build  the  ‘‘Scaffolds’’  (i.e.,  demonstrate
and  model  the  applications  enabled  by  foundational  programs  in  an  integrated  ap-
proach)  to  support  the  NextGen  Vision.  Then  we  must  strengthen  the  scaffold’s
three ‘‘Pillars’’: 1) System Engineering supported by robust modeling and simulation
capability  to  support  the  other  two  Pillars,  and  to  refine  the  architecture  and  inte-
grate  technologies;  2)  System  Acquisition  and  Integrated  Management  at  FAA  and
other  implementing  agencies;  and  3)  Deployment  Planning  to  include  operational
concepts, safety, procedures, training and security.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Ian  A.  Waitz,  PARTNER  Director;  Jerome  C.  Hunsaker  Professor  of
Aeronautics  and  Astronautics;  Head,  Department  of  Aeronautics  and  Astronau-
tics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. The high cost of fuel has forced airlines to remove less fuel-efficient aircraft from
their fleets and reduce the number of flights. In the near-term this should result
in  less  fuel  consumed  and  a  commensurate  decrease  in  emissions.  But  airlines
are  also  delaying  plans  to  purchase  newer,  quieter  and  more  fuel-efficient  re-
placement  aircraft.  Does  the  new  energy  picture  alter  the  thrust  and  urgency  of
your team’s 2004 report on aviation and the environment?

A1. The new energy picture increases the urgency of the need to jointly address en-
vironment  and  energy  issues  for  air  transportation.  Two-thirds  of  every  drop  of  pe-
troleum  is  used  by  transportation.  The  transportation  sector  is  one  of  the  fastest
growing  major  economic  sectors  with  respect  to  CO2 emissions.  And  within  the
transportation  sector,  aviation  is  the  fastest  growing  mode  of  transportation  in
many regions of the world. Aviation is also uniquely challenged in terms of opportu-
nities  for  improvement  because  of  the  weight,  volume,  and  safety  constraints  that
come with flight (relative to movement on the surface of the Earth). Further, while
commercial  air  transportation  is  an  industry  that  is  estimated  to  contribute  three
percent to eight percent to the U.S. GDP, it is also an industry that is very sensitive
to a variety of economic drivers like the price of fuel. As some support for this, note
that the historical net operating profits for the industry as a whole are around zero
percent.  Indeed,  the  balance  with  regard  to  the  adoption  of  more  fuel-efficient  air-
craft  that  you  identify  in  your  question  is  a  reflection  of  this  sensitivity.  Never  be-
fore has there been a more opportune time to jointly promote environment and econ-
omy through addressing the challenges of aviation, environment, and energy.
Q2. In  a  February  report  to  the  Subcommittee,  GAO  reported  that  noise  reduction
technologies  may  be  limited  by  concerns  about  global  warming  as  advances  in
these  technologies  could  make  it  more  difficult  to  also  achieve  reductions  in
emissions  of  greenhouse  gases.  In  your  opinion,  are  reductions  in  noise  and
emissions mutually exclusive or could high fuel prices spur technological innova-
tions we have yet to envision?

A2. There are many examples of trade-offs in aircraft and engine technology where
improving one thing (e.g., noise performance) penalizes something else (e.g., fuel ef-
ficiency  and  GHG  emissions).  This  is  true  with  many  noise  reduction  technologies.
There  are  also  examples  of  co-benefits,  whereby  changes  to  improve  fuel  efficiency
also  reduce  noise  (or  other  environmental  or  performance  issues)—as  was  the  case
with  the  introduction  of  the  high  bypass  ratio  gas  turbine  engine  in  the  ‘70s  and
‘80s.  So  there  is  not  a  ‘‘yes’’  or  ‘‘no’’  answer  to  this  question  that  is  always  true.
Nonetheless,  it  is  true  that  most  design  changes  for  relatively  mature,  well-devel-
oped  technologies  exhibit  negative  trade-offs  whereby  improving  one  aspect  of  per-
formance  (environmental,  safety,  economics,  etc.)  limits  other  performance  objec-
tives.  This  is  a  result  of  aircraft  being  highly  optimized  systems  refined  for  specific
performance objectives. I wish to emphasize that these trade-offs are most acute for
known, and relatively mature technologies. Historically, new and innovative aircraft
technology  has  changed  the  equation  (e.g.,  by  enabling  a  beneficial  step  change  in
several  performance  objectives  at  the  same  time).  It  is  exactly  this  type  of  innova-
tion  that  is  required  and  that  should  be  the  focus  of  more  robust,  federally  funded
research and development programs in NASA and FAA.
Q3. In  light  of  the  uncertainty  associated  with  how  greenhouse  gas  and  other  emis-
sions  from  aviation  will  be  dealt  with  worldwide,  how  can  the  JPDO  address
the concern that the NextGen initiative is honing in on solutions without a clear
idea of the problem?

A3. First,  I  concur  fully  with  the  concern.  It  is  hard  to  make  a  case  that  NextGen
is  honing  in  on  the  right  solutions  if  they  don’t  have  a  clear  idea  of  the  problem.
JPDO’s  understanding  of  the  climate  change  impacts  of  aviation  is  indeed  insuffi-
cient. As noted in both my written and oral testimony, this should be addressed by
funding  a  scientific  research  program  that  focuses  on  aviation  and  climate  change
(one  designed  specifically  to  answer  the  needs  of  the  decision-makers  with  regard
to  technology,  operational  procedures,  and  policies).  This  is  especially  critical  be-
cause of the unique nature of aviation’s impacts on climate. In my mind, this is the

single greatest failing of our national aviation and environment research enterprise
today.  Climate  change  is  a  critical  concern  that  could  greatly  impact  the  industry
and  human  health  and  welfare,  we  have  the  talent  to  answer  the  important  ques-
tions  and  to  plot  a  reasoned,  intelligent  path  forward,  yet  the  work  to  answer  the
questions is not being funded. And the magnitude of the funding required (perhaps
$5M  per  year)  is  embarrassingly  small  compared  to  the  potential  impact  of  even  a
single misplaced policy decision on an industry that contributes so much to our well
being and economy.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. With  the  upcoming  change  in  Administrations,  do  you  foresee  difficulties  main-
taining  program  continuity  during  the  transition?  Does  NextGen  have  enough
traction  among  its  partner  agencies  to  maintain  momentum  in  the  months
ahead?

A1. We are currently suffering because of inaction in advance of the change in Ad-
ministration:  no  new  reauthorization  for  FAA,  no  new  reauthorization  for  NASA.
Within  these  reauthorization  bills  are  the  critical  programs  required  to  jointly  ad-
dress aviation and environment. The programs are not going forward under the con-
tinuing resolution. Important new programs have been put on hold—programs that
were  already  overdue.  A  related  question  is  whether  the  momentum  that  NextGen
has  now  is  sufficient.  I  believe  it  is  not.  So  the  current  momentum  is  insufficient,
and  it  is  being  hurt  further  by  inaction  surrounding  the  change  in  Administration.
Q2. The  Joint  Planning  and  Development  Office  is  a  planning  and  coordinating
body  that  relies  on  the  cooperation  of  its  federal  partners  to  provide  expertise
and resources needed to accomplish NextGen. With slightly more than four years
of  experience,  how  would  you  rate  the  effectiveness  of  the  JPDO,  especially  with
regard  to  engaging  and  sustaining  the  cooperation  of  the  participating  federal
agencies?  What  concerns,  if  any,  do  you  have  about  JPDO’s  effectiveness  fol-
lowing the reorganization?

A2. The  first  two  to  three  years  of  JPDO  as  a  whole  were  rough.  However,  in  the
last  year,  I  have  seen  progress  being  made,  especially  with  regard  to  coordination
between FAA and NASA, which is particularly important in the environmental area.
And  as  I  noted  in  my  testimony,  within  the  JPDO,  the  Environmental  Working
Group has been a bright spot. However, for the JPDO as a whole, if 1 were to assign
a grade, I would give them a C or a D for first couple years, and a B more recently.
There is room for improvement. I do not know how this will be impacted by the re-

Q3. You  point  out  that  the  Europeans  are  beginning  to  leap  ahead  in  research  on
aviation’s  impact  on  climate.  What  are  the  implications?  Does  Europe  share
their  research  findings  broadly,  as  we  do  with  government  funded  R&D?  Will
it affect the competitiveness of American products in the marketplace?

A3. The  research  findings  from  European  research  programs  are  shared  through
journal  publications  and  presentations  at  conferences.  These  often  come  a  year  or
two  after  the  work  is  complete.  There  are  insufficient  opportunities  for  non-EU  en-
gagement  in  the  scientific  process  earlier  in  the  process  as  the  work  is  being
planned  and  carried  out.  Such  engagement  is  particularly  important  for  promoting
an  effective,  mutually  beneficial,  international  research  enterprise.  And  even  if  the
sharing  of  results  was  immediate,  it  does  not  imply  that  the  questions  being  ad-
dressed  in  their  research  programs  are  the  same  questions  that  we  would  want  to
address.  We  have  different  national  and  local  interests,  and  different  opportunities
with respect to addressing these interests. Research by proxy for important national
issues  like  air  transportation  and  the  environment  is  not  a  strong  approach  in  my
opinion.
Q4. You state that proposed funding levels for FAA’s CLEEN (Continuous Lower En-
ergy,  Emissions  and  Noise)  program  are  insufficient  to  promote  needed  techno-
logical advances. What level of funding do you consider appropriate?

A4. We  need  to  accelerate  the  technology,  operations,  and  alternative  fuels  pro-
grams  in  both  NASA  and  FAA  with  an  emphasis  on  programs  that  bridge  funda-
mental  aeronautics  research  and  industrial  development  programs.  FAA’s  CLEEN
program funding should not be considered in a vacuum without the context of fund-
ing for parallel NASA programs. I believe that something on the order of $0.5B per
year  should  be  invested  in  jointly  addressing  aviation  and  environment  with  ap-
proximately 20 percent invested on the FAA side and 80 percent on the NASA side.

With  respect  to  NASA  funding,  I  am  pleased  to  note  that  this  parallels  rec-
ommendations  made  in  various  versions  of  the  pending  reauthorization  bills.  With
respect  to  FAA,  it  is  a  factor  of  two  or  three  higher  than  proposed  in  the  pending
reauthorization bills.
Q5. Based  on  research  to  date,  have  any  estimates  of  the  cost  of  producing  alter-

native fuels been provided if industry were to embrace full-scale production?

A5. Yes,  production  cost  estimates  have  been  provided  by  researchers  in  industry,
governmental  agencies,  and  academia  for  several  potential  alternative  fuels.  How-
ever, because of the multiple potential alternative fuels, there is a wide range of es-
timated  production  costs.  These  production  costs  depend  heavily  on  the  choice  of
feedstock  (e.g.,  coal,  natural  gas,  solid  biomass,  and  algal  oil)  and  the  process  that
is  used  to  convert  the  feedstock  into  an  alternative  fuel  (e.g.,  Fischer-Tropsch  syn-
thesis, or hydro-processing). The production costs are currently estimated to be larg-
er  than  those  for  petroleum,  but  for  fuel  prices  at  or  above  those  we  have  seen  re-
cently,  production  of  fuels  from  some  of  the  alternative  feedstocks  appears  to  eco-
nomically attractive. Production cost estimates will always have uncertainties asso-
ciated  with  them;  this  uncertainty  will  decrease  as  more  is  known  about  the  proc-
esses.
