EPA’s Restructured IRIS System:

Have Polluters and Politics

Overwhelmed Science?

WEDNESDAY, MAY 21, 2008

11:00 A.M.–1:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

The Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight will hold the first of two hear-
ings on the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) at the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency (EPA).

We  have  three  excellent  witnesses  who  can  place  the  role  of  IRIS  in  perspective
as  well  as  address  questions  regarding  the  Bush  Administration’s  evolving  system
to draft and review IRIS entries:
Mr.  John  Stephenson,  Director,  Natural  Resources  and  Environment,  Government

Accountability Office.

Dr.  George  Gray,  Assistant  Administrator  for  Research  and  Development,  United

States Environmental Protection Agency.

Ms. Susan Dudley, Administrator, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Of-

fice of Management and Budget.

What Is IRIS and Why Does It Matter?

IRIS was established in the 1980s to provide a single source of information on the
risks  associated  with  exposure  to  chemicals.  The  IRIS  database  provides  a  hazard
identification and dose-response analysis, scientific information that when combined
with  estimates  of  exposure  allow  regulatory  agencies  to  produce  a  risk  assessment.
Historically,  entries  to  the  database  were  the  result  of  extensive  in-house  develop-
ment  by  the  science  staff  at  EPA,  peer  review  processes  with  experts  from  outside
the  agency,  and  opportunities  for  public  input  and  comment.  To  the  degree  inter-
agency communications occurred, they were managed by EPA (See Figure 1).

While not a regulatory product itself, IRIS is designed to help regulators set prior-
ities  about  what  to  regulate  and  inform  regulators  about  what  level  of  exposure
workers  or  communities  can  absorb  safely.  A  long-recognized  principle  in  the  U.S.
approach to regulation has been the distinction between risk assessment—the char-
acterization  of  what  science  tells  us  regarding  a  particular  hazard—and  risk  man-
agement,  or  what  you  want  to  do  about  the  hazard  (including  choosing  to  do  noth-
ing).  Science  can  point  to  where  regulation  may  be  needed,  but  science  may  not  be
the sole consideration in setting a regulatory standard or approach. IRIS is designed
to  be  a  risk  assessment  tool.  Government  officials  in  federal  agencies,  in  State  and
county governments and even in foreign countries, have come to rely upon IRIS for
the most reliable, most comprehensive statements on what science tells us about the
risk associated with a particular chemical.

A long-standing challenge for the IRIS database is meeting the requests for infor-
mation  on  the  many  chemicals  that  are  manufactured  and  utilized  in  global  com-
merce, and updating information on chemicals that have been previously evaluated.
IRIS  is  loosing  ground  to  the  torrent  of  new  chemicals  introduced  to  the  market-
place.  Approximately  700  new  chemicals  enter  commerce  each  year.  Those  new
chemicals  are  added  to  the  over  80,000  currently  reported  under  the  Toxic  Sub-
stances  Control  Act  (TSCA)  as  being  in  the  market.  In  addition,  about  one  half  of
the  assessments  on  approximately  480  chemicals  currently  in  the  database  need  to
be  updated  according  to  EPA  staff  estimates.  To  keep  IRIS  relevant  would  require
aggressive moves to speed the production and approval of entries. Congress has ac-
tually  increased  funding  for  IRIS  staff  in  recent  years  in  an  effort  to  address  this
severe backlog (this committee supported increased funding in Chairman Boehlert’s
FY  2007  Views  and  Estimates  Report  to  the  Committee  on  the  Budget—see  Figure
2 for a representation of the IRIS budget).

IRIS Slows to a Crawl

Instead  of  seeing  IRIS  entries  spike  with  funding  and  personnel  increases,  addi-
tions and updates to IRIS have slowed to a crawl (Figure 3). Only four IRIS listings
have  been  finalized  in  the  past  two  years.  In  comparison,  the  State  of  Minnesota
requested new or updated assessments of 52 chemicals of concern in the 2006 solici-
tation for the 2007 Program.1

This  outcome  appears  to  be  tied  to  the  intervention  of  OMB  in  the  IRIS  review
and approval process. Beginning in 2004, OMB established a formal system of inter-
agency  review  (Figure  5).  This  system,  ostensibly  designed  to  improve  the  quality
of  IRIS  entries,  appears  to  have  all  but  stopped  IRIS  entries.  On  April  10  of  this
year,  EPA  announced  a  new  IRIS  review  and  approval  system  that  is  even  more
elaborate than its predecessors (Figure 4).

It  appears  that  any  IRIS  listing  that  is  the  least  bit  controversial  will  take  six
years or more to be completed. The interagency process allows agencies with a direct

conflict  of  interest  multiple  opportunities  to  influence  the  development  and  content
of  IRIS  assessments  all  within  a  process  that  lacks  any  transparency  for  Congress
or the public. The Department of Defense, the Department of Energy and NASA all
are  responsible  for  pollution  on  the  federal  lands  they  manage  and  for  the  health
and safety of the personnel that manage their facilities and operations. Rocket fuel,
jet fuel, solvents, munitions, nuclear waste all contain hazardous materials that can
become  pollutants  contaminating  aquifers  and  air,  and  exposing  workers  and  fami-
lies to real harm.

IRIS Entries Become a Political Science

EPA  leadership  has  agreed  to  OMB  establishing  a  review  that  gives  polluting
agencies  lengthy,  unmonitored  opportunities  to  try  to  convince  OMB  that  the  risks
of a particular substance should not be set at a particular level. It is hard to under-
stand  what  special  science  expertise  these  other  agencies  bring  to  the  table  such
that OMB needs to set up an interagency review to discuss science.

Remember  that  the  development  of  IRIS  assessments  and,  the  risk  assessment
process  generally,  is  supposed  to  be  separate  from  the  risk  management  process.
There  you  would  expect  interested  parties,  including  other  federal  agencies,  to  dis-
cuss  how  to  manage  risks  by  weighing  costs  and  benefits  in  a  search  for  the  best
option given a particular configuration of risk and need. IRIS is supposed to be sole-
ly about what science says regarding health and environmental risk associated with
the  listed  chemicals.  With  7000  scientists,  and  mandated  by  law  and  appropriation
to  be  the  Nation’s  lead  agency  on  environmental  science,  EPA  really  has  no  peers
when it comes to understanding the science at stake in IRIS listings.

The process established on April 10 allowing agencies to discuss a particular IRIS
listing is closed to the public. Because that work represents pre-deliberative discus-
sions, any materials from that process are not subject to the Freedom of Information
Act. Because these processes are managed by OMB, it will be very difficult for Con-
gress  to  learn  of  what  is  happening  due  to  OMB’s  consistent  assertions  that  all  of
their work should be shielded from Congress and the public. Whether the proposals
that  come  out  of  this  lengthy,  secretive  process  are  based  solely  on  science,  or
whether  other  considerations  held  sway,  would  be  very  hard  for  anyone  to  ever
prove.

IRIS is withering. It is loosing its relevance due to the sweep of time, new science
and new substances as well as its own inability to refresh its data. The process put
in place on April 10 appears guaranteed not to improve this situation, but to make
it worse. But even if the process was somehow producing more entries, more quick-
ly,  the  integrity  of  the  process  is  itself  in  question  and  that  alone  will  undermine
the  utility  of  the  IRIS  database.  If  policy-makers  and  the  public  believe  the  science
has  been  cooked  to  meet  a  polluter’s  agenda,  then  they  will  not  have  confidence  in
the science. It is a simple problem and one that the April 10 revision puts at center
stage.

The  Subcommittee  hopes  to  explore  these  issues  with  witnesses  on  Wednesday

morning.

The  Minnesota  Department  of  Health  Submission  to  the  In-
tegrated  Risk  Information  System  (IRIS);  Request  for
Chemical Substance Nominations for 2007 Program (Dock-
et ID No. EPA–HQ–ORD–2006–0950)

The  Health  Risk  Assessment  staff  at  the  Minnesota  Department  of  Health  wish
to  nominate  a  list  of  chemicals  to  be  included  in  the  Integrated  Risk  Information
System  (IRIS);  Request  for  Chemical  Substance  Nomination  for  2007  Program.
These chemicals are of concern to the Minnesota Department of Health because they
are  among  contaminants  found  in  Minnesota  groundwater.  In  Minnesota,  health-
based values are derived for such contaminants. When conducting risk assessments,
the  Minnesota  Department  of  Health  has  relied  upon  the  IRIS  summaries  as  a  re-
source  for  the  development  of  these  health  protective  values.  Therefore,  it  is  our
hope  that  you  take  our  nominated  chemicals  in  consideration.  By  obtaining  IRIS
summaries  of  these  chemicals  it  will  result  in  a  more  thorough  and  accurate  risk
assessment process.

In  addition,  the  Minnesota  Department  of  Health  currently  needs  and  uses  ref-
erence  concentrations  and  reference  doses  for  less  than  chronic  periods  of  exposure
to  assess  risks  from  a  variety  of  exposure  scenarios.  These  scenarios  include  less
than  chronic  exposures  that  commonly  occur  at  contaminated  sites  resulting  in  the
need for less than chronic toxicity values to assess current risks. The EPA 2002 ‘‘A
review of the reference dose and reference concentration processes’’ has guided much
of the practice of the Department in this area.

The  Department  has  found  that  health  effects  that  result  from  less  than  chronic
periods  of  exposure,  when  combined  with  high  drinking  water  exposures  associated
with  specific  life  stages  (e.g.,  childhood),  result  in  drinking  water  values  that  are
lower  and  therefore  more  appropriate  as  drinking  water  standards  for  the  general
population than the value calculated using a chronic reference dose and lifetime av-
erage dose. As a result, the Department is very interested in recent efforts by IRIS
to develop less than lifetime reference values, and urges the EPA to continue to de-
velop  and  publish  these  analyses.  The  Department  also  urges  the  EPA  to  consider
the  potential  that  effects  observed  in  chronic  studies  result  from  early  exposures
rather  than  continuous  exposure.  To  the  extent  that  studies  are  available;  the  De-

uations (recommendations for critical studies for each and resulting reference doses)
for each chemical that undergoes review in the future.

Chairman MILLER. Good morning. This hearing will now come to

order.

More  than  80,000  chemicals  are  now  in  use,  and  another  700
new  chemicals  enter  the  marketplace  each  year.  Americans  need
an efficient system to evaluate the risk to public health and the en-
vironment of chemicals on a regular basis and to have ready access
to  that  information.  That  is  the  mission  of  the  Integrated  Risk  In-
formation  System,  or  IRIS,  but  IRIS  now  has  evaluations  of  only
about 480 chemicals.

In  recent  years,  IRIS’s  assessments  have  not  been  the  open  dis-
cussions  among  scientists  we  associate  with  scientific  peer  review
but have become a secretive process managed by OMB. OMB’s mis-
sion  does  not  include  scientific  analysis,  nor  does  OMB  appear  to
have the expertise to perform such work. As a result of OMB’s con-
trol  of  IRIS  evaluation  procedures,  however,  four  chemicals  have
been listed by IRIS in the last two fiscal years. EPA scientists pro-
duced  15  or  so  assessments  in  each  of  those  years,  but  the  assess-
ments  disappeared  into  an  abyss  of  elaborate,  endless  reviews,
mostly behind closed doors. A weighing of the need for assessments
against  the  productivity  under  IRIS  appears  to  show  that  the  sys-
tem is fundamentally broken and in desperate need of reform.

Instead, EPA and OMB appear intent upon choking productivity
under  IRIS  further  still  and  depriving  the  assessments  of  what
credibility  they  have  left.  Just  last  month,  EPA  unveiled  its  new
process  for  developing  and  reviewing  IRIS  assessments.  The  solu-
tion offered by EPA and OMB is to take an already-broken system
and to make it more convoluted, more secretive, and more suspect.
The  new  system  establishes  an  interagency  process  that  gives
polluting  agencies  even  more  opportunity  than  they  had  before  to
slow walk the IRIS process to avoid the consequences of their own
conduct.  With  the  new  process  announced  April  10,  we  may  view
two  new  entries  a  year  as  the  golden  era  of  IRIS  assessments.  As
GAO will testify this morning, it is highly likely that no new chem-
ical  entry  that  is  the  least  bit  controversial  will  ever  come  out  of
this  system  in  less  than  six  years  and  probably  more  like  eight
years.

If the goal of the IRIS review process is to produce new IRIS en-
tries, this system, designed by OMB and dutifully blessed by EPA’s
leadership,  would  be  judged  an  abysmal  failure.  However,  if  the
goal is to avoid new IRIS entries, or at least troublesome, inconven-
ient  entries,  this  new  system  should  perform  beautifully.  It  effec-
tively kills IRIS without honestly acknowledging that intent.

How does it kill IRIS?
Any  new  entry  or  revision  that  will  make  it  into  IRIS  will  be  of
very  dubious  reliability.  Any  entries  that  make  it  into  IRIS  will
emerge  from  a  largely  secretive  process  that  allows  polluters  to
urge EPA to shift its science so that it is acceptable to the polluting
agencies.  The  public  will  never  have  confidence  that  EPA  stood
firm  on  scientific  principle  or  fought  off  the  combined  forces  of
OMB,  the  Department  of  Defense,  the  Department  of  Energy,  or
any  other  agencies  that  may  have  a  desire  to  avoid  cleaning  up
their practices or their messes. If the science appears to have been
reworked  behind  closed  doors  to  protect  the  interests  of  polluters,
at the instance of polluters, who can believe the science?

The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA, at OMB
say  that  they  are  just  managing  an  interagency  process.  That  is  a
fiction.  EPA  is  the  agency  that  Congress  directed  in  statute  to  do
environmental  science  and  charged  with  protecting  public  health
and the environment. EPA is given billions of dollars a year in tax
funds to carry out that research and regulatory work.

There is no need for the secretive interagency process that OMB
is requiring. The Department of Defense and National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, the Department of Energy have entirely
different  missions  and  entirely  different  areas  of  expertise.  Their
interest in IRIS is that of an agency using the very chemicals that
are  being  evaluated,  not  of  a  scientific  agency  making  decisions
based  upon  science.  OMB  is  using  that  interagency  process  to  un-
dermine IRIS’s integrity and take it away from EPA’s control.

EPA  says  that  this  really  is  their  process,  honest.  They  control
it  and  are  happy  with  it,  but  it  is  headed  by  political  appointees.
Dr.  Gray  is  a  political  appointee.  His  testimony  has  been  vetted
and approved by OMB. EPA’s official response even to the GAO re-
port we will hear today was vetted and approved by OMB. And no
IRIS entry can go forward without OMB approval.

The  Oversight  and  Government  Reform  Committee  this  week,
just  yesterday,  held  a  hearing  and  issued  a  report  that  dem-
onstrates  the  degree  to  which  the  White  House  has  controlled  the
opinions  of  the  EPA  scientists  on  regulatory  matters.  With  IRIS,
we see that even in the realm of science, before policy should have
a  role,  before  economic  consideration  should  have  a  role,  EPA  ap-
pears to follow the dictates of OMB. Thousands of career scientists
must answer to political appointees without scientific expertise not
about how to manage risk, whether risk management measures are
justified by the economic costs, but about what risks chemicals pose
to  public  health  and  to  the  environment  in  the  first  place,  a  ques-
tion in which political considerations should have no role.

Whatever  your  personal  views  of  motive  or  intent  by  the  EPA,
the  political  leadership  of  the  EPA,  or  by  OMB,  I  hope  almost  ev-
eryone  would  agree  that  two  new  entries  a  year  when  700  chemi-
cals are entering the marketplace every year, is just not acceptable.
I look forward to GAO’s testimony today for offering advice to Con-
gress  on  how  to  make  IRIS  relevant  again  and  responsive  to  the
needs  of  the  American  public  again  and  not  just  to  agencies  that
are  using  chemicals  and  do  not  want  to  be  disturbed,  do  not  want
to be inconvenienced, and their friends at OIRA.

ductivity under IRIS, appears to show that the system is fundamentally broken and
cries out for reform.

Instead,  EPA  and  OMB  appear  intent  upon  choking  productivity  under  IRIS  fur-
ther  still,  and  depriving  the  assessments  of  their  remaining  credibility.  Just  last

If  the  goal  of  the  IRIS  review  process  was  to  produce  new  IRIS  entries,  this  sys-
tem—designed at OMB and dutifully blessed by EPA’s leadership—would be judged
an  abysmal  failure.  However,  if  the  goal  is  to  avoid  new  IRIS  entries,  or  at  least

of  expertise.  Their  interest  in  IRIS  is  that  of  a  polluter,  not  of  a  science  agency.
OMB is using this interagency process to subvert the IRIS process and take it away
from EPA’s control.

with  it.  Dr.  Gray  is  a  political  appointee  of  the  Administration.  His  testimony  has

forward without OMB approval.

a question in which political considerations should play no part.

Whatever your personal views of motive or intent of EPA or OMB, I think almost
everyone  would  agree  that  just  two  new  entries  a  year  is  simply  not  acceptable.  I
look  forward  to  GAO’s  testimony  today  for  offering  advice  to  Congress  on  how  to
make IRIS relevant and responsive to the needs of the American public and not just
a handful of polluters and their friends at OIRA.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Sensenbrenner follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE F. JAMES SENSENBRENNER JR.

The  Integrated  Risk  Information  System  (IRIS)  process  was  originally  developed
for a specific task. Different offices throughout the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) were relying on different assessments of the health effects of chronic exposure
to  toxic  chemicals.  IRIS  was  intended  to  establish  a  uniform  database  within  EPA.
Over  time,  however,  IRIS  became  an  authoritative  resource  on  chemical  toxicity.
Other  agencies,  states,  the  international  community,  and  industries  increasingly
began  to  rely  on  IRIS,  and  the  assessments  took  on  increased  importance.  These
outside  groups  have  sought  to  impact  a  process  that  was  not  initially  designed  to
handle external pressures. The result has been an IRIS process that has effectively
broken down.

The  Government  Accountability  Office  (GAO)  recently  issued  a  scathing  con-
demnation of the current state of the IRIS program. The report’s title, Low Produc-
tivity  and  New  Interagency  Review  Process  Limit  the  Usefulness  and  Credibility  of
EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System, accurately sums up GAO’s findings. But
IRIS’ actual production numbers are worse. EPA currently has a backlog of 70 ongo-
ing assessments and has managed to complete only two assessments in each of the
last  two  years.  At  the  current  pace,  it  will  take  35  years  for  EPA  to  finish  its  cur-
rent backlog.

EPA has attempted to develop a uniform process for IRIS assessments. The agen-
cy  argues  that  it  can  expedite  the  IRIS  process  by  involving  other  agencies  earlier
in the process. While preventing last minute delays is an important reform, the abil-
ity of other agencies to extend the timeframe of assessments should be sharply lim-
ited. Data gaps in risk assessments will always exist as better science is always de-
veloping. EPA needs to limit the timeframe of assessments to prevent other agencies
from indefinitely delaying the process.

EPA must balance its need to complete assessments with the rights of interested
parties to comment. The best way to achieve this balance would be to give more no-
tice  of  its  assessments.  EPA  already  publishes  an  annual  agenda  of  the  chemical
it  intends  to  assess  in  the  Federal  Register.  If  EPA  moves  the  date  of  that  publica-
tion  forward,  providing  more  notice,  interested  parties  will  have  a  longer  period  to
comment  on  what  they  deem  to  be  insufficiencies  in  the  scientific  record.  During
this  comment  period,  EPA  can  focus  on  its  backlog.  Because  it  offered  a  comment
period, EPA can then fairly limit the ability of outside parties to delay assessments
once they are underway. The result would be a more efficient process that preserves
taxpayers’ money and promotes public health.

I urge EPA to consider these proposals, because IRIS must be fixed. In April, this
subcommittee held a hearing on formaldehyde levels in trailers provided to the vic-
tims  of  Hurricane  Katrina.  In  that  hearing,  we  investigated  how  the  Agency  for
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry struggled to identify the proper ‘‘level of con-
cern’’ for long-term exposure to formaldehyde. EPA determined its formaldehyde as-
sessment  was  outdated  in  1997,  but  eleven  years  later,  that  assessment  is  still  in-
complete.  These  hurricane  victims  are  the  real  world  result  of  EPA’s  bureaucratic
failures.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Mr.  Chairman,  I  appreciate  the  Subcommittee’s  attention  to  this  important  mat-
ter.  The  role  of  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency’s  (EPA)  IRIS  program  cannot
be  understated.  Created  in  the  1980s,  the  program  is  a  primary  resource  for  infor-
mation on the risks associated to exposure of chemicals. Government officials, State
and local governments and many scientists have come to rely on the comprehensive
analysis completed by the IRIS program.

However,  the  rate  at  which  information  requests  have  been  processed  over  the
years is troubling. Recent revisions to the program have received conflicting reviews
as  to  whether  these  steps  will  increase  productivity  or  continue  to  slow  the  process
further.  A  March  2008  GAO  report  concluded  that  the  IRIS  database  is  at  serious
risk  of  becoming  incomplete  because  EPA  has  not  been  able  to  routinely  complete
timely, credible assessments or decrease its backlog of 70 ongoing assessments. That
a total of four assessments were completed over the course of fiscal years 2006 and
2007 is unacceptable.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  our  witnesses’  testimony  today  and  working  with  my
colleagues  on  the  Committee  to  improve  and  increase  efficiency  within  this  impor-
tant program. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  The  mission  of  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency
is to protect both environmental quality and human health through effective regula-
tions and other policy implementation.

What is confounding to me, regarding the Integrated Risk Information System, is

why only four IRIS listings have been finalized in the past two years.

After  all,  approximately  700  new  chemicals  enter  commerce  each  year.  There  are
more  than  80,000  chemicals  reported  under  the  Toxic  Substances  Control  Act  as
being in the market.

It  seems  implausible  to  me  that  only  four  chemicals  should  be  investigated  to

completion and published in the IRIS database at E.P.A.

The Government Accountability Office report, published in March 2008, concluded
that,  ‘‘the  IRIS  database  is  at  serious  risk  of  becoming  obsolete  because  E.P.A.  has
not  been  able  to  routinely  complete  timely,  credible  assessments  or  decrease  its
backlog of 70 ongoing assessments.’’

The  statement  of  George  M.  Gray,  Ph.D.,  who  is  Assistant  Administrator  for  Re-
search and Development at E.P.A., explains that IRIS began as ‘‘an internal E.P.A.
resource.’’

Even  if  that  explanation  is  true,  then  why  would  E.P.A.  compile  only  four  IRIS

listings in the past two years?

and public health.

It  makes  me  question  what  E.P.A.  is  doing,  when  it  comes  to  chemical  toxicity

Dr.  Gray’s  statement  also  says  that  the  risk  assessment  process  ‘‘consists  of  both

‘science’ and ‘science policy’ components.’’

It  goes  on  to  say  that,  ‘‘although  there  are  some  instances  at  E.P.A.  where  ‘pure
science’ is involved, . . . much of the work done at E.P.A. . . . involves both science
and  science  policy.  . . .Due  to  the  uncertainty  in  IRIS  assessments,  judgments  and
choices must be made about the most appropriate assumptions . . . to use in deriv-
ing toxicity data.’’

Mr. Chairman, I chafe at this testimony.
These  statements  insult  the  scientific  community  that  publishes  data  on  these
matters. They also insult the talented scientists who are working at E.P.A., who are
perfectly  capable  of  interpreting  peer-reviewed  literature  and  making  public  health
decisions.

This  subcommittee  has  concerns  that  the  IRIS  system  has  become  politicized,
when  it  should  be  based  solely  on  scientific  facts  regarding  health  and  environ-
mental risk associated with the listed chemicals.

Although  I  understand  that  E.P.A.  is  making  moves  to  re-evaluate  the  IRIS  Sys-

tem, there are only so many patches that may be placed on a sinking ship.

For  me,  what  is  truly  sinking  is  the  feeling  I  get  when  I  consider  the  good  sci-
entists  who  have  dedicated  their  entire  careers  to  environmental  safety  at  E.P.A.
I  suspect  that  those  who  remain  must  be  frustrated  at  this  gross  politicization  of
science and wide scale destruction of our environment.

Mr.  Chairman,  you  will  know  that  I  have  a  near-perfect  voting  record  with  envi-
ronmental groups, and I will be swift to act, should I see a way to rectify the situa-
tion.

Thank you, and I yield back the remainder of my time.

TESTIMONY  OF  MR.  JOHN  B.  STEPHENSON,  DIRECTOR,  NAT-
URAL  RESOURCES  AND  ENVIRONMENT,  GOVERNMENT  AC-
COUNTABILITY OFFICE
Mr. STEPHENSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and other Members
of  the  Committee.  I  am  here  today  to  discuss  our  recently  issued
report  on  IRIS,  a  database  that  contains  the  scientific  position  on
health  effects  of  exposure  to  more  than  540  toxic  chemicals.  IRIS
is  a  critical  component  of  EPA’s  capacity  to  support  scientifically
sound  environmental  decisions,  policies,  and  regulations.  Our
March  2008  report  concluded  that  the  IRIS  database  is  at  serious
risk  of  becoming  obsolete  because  EPA  has  not  been  able  to  com-
plete  timely,  credible  assessments  or  decrease  its  back-load  of  70
ongoing  assessments.  In  summary,  we  found  that  EPA  efforts  to
improve  IRIS  since  2000  have  been  thwarted  by  a  combination  of
factors including OMB interagency reviews, EPA decisions to delay
assessments  to  wait  for  new  research  or  additional  uncertainty
analysis, and the compounding effect of continuous delays.

The  two  new  OMB  interagency  reviews  involve  other  federal
agencies in a manner that limits the credibility of IRIS assessment
and hinders EPA’s ability to manage them. In addition, OMB is in-
serting  itself  into  the  decision-making  process  by,  for  example,  re-
quiring  EPA  to  terminate  five  assessments  EPA’s  own  office  of
theirs  said  that  it  needed  to  implement  the  Clean  Air  Act.  The  ef-
fect  of  all  of  these  changes  to  what  should  be  a  scientific  process
is that chemicals remain in the assessment phase indefinitely, and
few  assessments  are  ever  finalized.  Indeed,  EPA  staff  have  pre-
pared over 32 draft assessments of toxic chemicals in the past two
years, yet only four have been finalized.

Our  report  includes  eight  specific  recommendations  for  stream-
lining  the  IRIS  program,  improving  the  transparency  and  credi-
bility of the assessments, and ensuring that EPA has the requisite
independence  to  achieve  its  goals,  recommendations  that  EPA  in
February  agreed  to  consider  before  finalizing  the  IRIS  process.
However, EPA released its final IRIS process on April 10th as you
mentioned,  and  instead  of  seeking  public  comment,  as  OMB  prom-
ised  in  responding  to  our  report,  made  it  effective  immediately.  To
say  that  we  are  disappointed  is  a  gross  understatement.  The  new
IRIS  process  is  not  responsive  to  our  recommendations  and  is  in
many respects worse than the draft we reviewed. For example, the
draft process would have made comments from other federal agen-
cies  part  of  the  public  record.  However,  the  new  process  expressly
defined  such  comments  as  deliberative,  excluding  them  from  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:30 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042370 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O08\052108\42370 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

16

public  record.  EPA’s  position  that  the  IRIS  process  is  transparent
because  final  assessments  must  undergo  public  and  external  peer
review  is  ludicrous.  Transparency  at  a  late  stage  after  OMB  and
other federal agencies have had multiple opportunities to influence
the content of the assessment without any disclosure of their input
does not compensate for its absence earlier.

In addition, the estimated timeframes under the new process will
likely  perpetuate  the  cycle  of  delays  and  exacerbate  the  problems
we  identified  in  our  report  and  sought  to  address  with  our  rec-
ommendations,  all  of  which  were  aimed  at  preserving  the  viability
of  this  critical  database  which  is  integral  to  EPA’s  mission  of  pro-
tecting  the  public  health  from  exposure  to  toxic  chemicals.  Instead
of significantly streamlining IRIS, EPA has institutionalized an as-
sessment process from the outset that will take 6 to 8 years to com-
plete.

We  all  understand  that  science  regarding  the  toxicity  of  a  given
chemical is never perfect, but at some point EPA must complete as-
sessments so that it can take the next step of exploring what regu-
latory options are appropriate for protecting human health. My tes-
timony  includes  several  examples  of  dangerous  chemicals  that  are
stuck in the endless loop of assessment and reassessment. I would
like to summarize just one very quickly.

In  1998,  EPA  initiated  a  toxic  risk  assessment  of  trichloro-
ethylene, a degreasing agent used widely by the Department of De-
fense and others. Numerous studies have linked TCE to cancer and
birth  defects  over  the  last  decade.  EPA  completed  a  draft  risk  as-
sessment in 2001 which was then peer reviewed by the science ad-
visory board and released for public comment. During the comment
process,  questions  were  raised  about  the  assessment  by  DOD  and
others  that  led  to  a  request  for  the  National  Academies  of  Science
to  review  it  in  2004.  In  2006,  the  Academies  concluded  that  the
weight  of  evidence  of  cancer  from  TCE  had  actually  strengthened
since  EPA’s  2001  assessment.  Nevertheless,  after  more  than  10
years,  TCE  is  back  at  the  draft  development  stage,  and  the  public
continues to be exposed to this dangerous chemical. EPA estimates
that its final assessment will not be completed until 2010. In frus-
tration,  five  Senators,  spurred  by  the  TCE  contamination  in  the
drinking water at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, introduced a bill
last  year  that  would  require  EPA  to  complete  its  risk  assessment
and issue a drinking water standard within 18 months.

Mr.  Chairman,  IRIS  is  a  critical  process  that  is  clearly  broken
and  needs  to  be  fixed.  We  believe  that  the  Congress  should  con-
sider  directing  EPA  to  suspend  implementation  of  its  new  process
and  develop  one  that  is  transparent  and  otherwise  responsive  to
our  recommendations.  If  EPA  is  unable  or  unwilling  to  take  the
steps  necessary  to  improve  this  critical  program,  we  believe  that
other approaches including legislative action may be needed.

That  concludes  my  comments,  and  I  will  be  happy  to  take  ques-

tions.

I am pleased to be here today to discuss issues associated with the Environmental
Protection  Agency’s  (EPA)  Integrated  Risk  Information  System  (IRIS)—one  of  the
most  significant  tools  that  EPA  has  developed  to  effectively  support  its  mission  of
protecting  people  and  the  environment  from  harmful  chemical  exposures.  IRIS  con-
tains EPA’s scientific position on the potential human health effects that may result
from exposure to more than 540 chemicals in the environment and is a critical com-
ponent of EPA’s capacity to support scientifically sound risk management decisions,
policies,  and  regulations.  IRIS  is  also  relied  upon  by  State  and  local  environmental
programs  and  some  international  regulatory  bodies  for  managing  their  environ-
mental  protection  programs.  As  shown  in  Figure  1,  the  toxicity  assessments  in  the
IRIS database fulfill the first two critical steps of the four-step risk assessment proc-
ess—providing  hazard  identification  and  quantitative  dose-response  assessments.
IRIS  information  can  then  be  used  with  the  results  of  exposure  assessments  (typi-
cally  conducted  by  EPA’s  program  or  regional  offices)  to  provide  an  overall  charac-
terization  of  the  public  health  risks  for  a  given  chemical  in  a  given  situation.  The
development  of  health  risk  assessments  is  thus  directly  dependent  on  the  develop-
ment of toxicity assessments such as those developed in the IRIS program.

Under  the  National  Academies’  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  paradigm,
policy considerations are relevant in the risk management phase, which occurs after
the risk assessment phase.1 With risk assessment information, decision-makers can
make  informed  risk  management  decisions  on  how  to  protect  public  health,  reflect-
ing other important data and considerations, such as the costs and benefits of miti-
gating  identified  risks,  the  technological  feasibility  of  managing  risks,  and  the  con-
cerns of various stakeholders. Examples of risk management decisions include decid-
ing how much of a chemical a company may discharge into a river, determining the
extent  to  which  a  hazardous  waste  site  must  be  cleaned  up,  and  setting  allowable
levels of contamination in drinking water.

Thus,  although  IRIS  assessments  are  not  regulatory  in  nature,  the  quantitative
IRIS  values  may  influence  many  risk  management  decisions  and  serve  as  a  basis
for  regulatory  consideration.  However,  EPA’s  productivity  in  finalizing  IRIS  assess-
ments  is  poor,  and  EPA  has  a  significant  backlog  of  incomplete  IRIS  assessments
and  a  growing  number  of  outdated  assessments.  Importantly,  EPA  has  not  been
able to complete assessments of key chemicals of concern to public health, including
dioxin, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene (TCE), naphthalene, and tetrachloroethylene
(perc) (see Appendix I).

In  this  context,  my  testimony  today  discusses  (1)  highlights  of  our  March  2008
report,  Chemical  Assessments:  Low  Productivity  and  New  Interagency  Review  Proc-
ess  Limit  the  Usefulness  and  Credibility  of  EPA’s  Integrated  Risk  Information  Sys-

tem2 and  (2)  key  aspects  of  EPA’s  revised  IRIS  assessment  process,  released  on
April 10, 2008. For our March 2008 report, we examined the outcome of steps EPA
has  taken  to  ensure  that  IRIS  contains  current,  credible  chemical  risk  information;
to address the backlog of ongoing assessments; and to respond to new requirements
from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). We also examined the potential
effects of planned changes to the IRIS assessment process on EPA’s ability to ensure
that  IRIS  provides  current,  credible  risk  information.  In  conducting  our  work,  we
obtained  and  analyzed  information  on  EPA’s  productivity  and  the  resources  pro-
vided to the program for fiscal years 2000 through 2007, user needs, and EPA’s as-
sessment completion goals. We also interviewed EPA’s National Center for Environ-
mental  Assessment  officials  who  manage  the  IRIS  assessment  program;  officials
from  other  EPA  program  offices  and  federal  science  and  health  agencies  involved
in  the  IRIS  assessment  process;  and  officials  from  the  Department  of  Defense,  the
Department  of  Energy  (DOE),  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration
(NASA),  and  OMB.  For  this  testimony,  we  supplemented  our  report  with  a  review
of the IRIS assessment process that EPA released on April 10, 2008. We conducted
this  work  from  May  7  to  May  21,  2008,  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  gov-
ernment auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence
obtained  provides  a  reasonable  basis  for  our  findings  and  conclusions  based  on  our
audit objectives.

Background

IRIS  was  created  in  1985  to  help  EPA  develop  consensus  opinions  within  the
agency about the health effects of chronic exposure to chemicals. Its importance has
increased  over  time  as  EPA  program  offices  and  the  states  have  increasingly  relied
on  IRIS  information  in  making  environmental  protection  decisions.  Currently,  the
IRIS database contains assessments of more than 540 chemicals. According to EPA,
national  and  international  users  access  the  IRIS  database  approximately  nine  mil-
lion times a year. EPA’s Assistant Administrator for the Office of Research and De-
velopment  has  described  IRIS  as  the  premier  national  and  international  source  for
qualitative  and  quantitative  chemical  risk  information;  other  federal  agencies  have
noted  that  IRIS  data  are  widely  accepted  by  all  levels  of  government  across  the
country  for  application  of  public  health  policy,  providing  benefits  such  as  uniform,
standardized methods for toxicology testing and risk assessment, as well as uniform
toxicity  values.  Similarly,  a  private-sector  risk  assessment  expert  has  stated  that
the IRIS database has become the most important source of regulatory toxicity val-
ues  for  use  across  EPA’s  programs  and  is  also  widely  used  across  State  programs
and internationally.

Historically and currently, the focus of IRIS toxicity assessments has been on the
potential  health  effects  of  long-term  (chronic)  exposure  to  chemicals.  According  to
OMB, EPA is the only federal agency that develops qualitative and quantitative as-
sessments  of  both  cancer  and  non-cancer  risks  of  exposure  to  chemicals,  and  EPA
does so largely under the IRIS program. Other federal agencies develop quantitative
estimates  of  non-cancer  effects  or  qualitative  cancer  assessments  of  exposure  to
chemicals  in  the  environment.  While  these  latter  assessments  provide  information
on the effects of long-term exposures to chemicals, they provide only qualitative as-
sessments of cancer risks (known human carcinogen, likely human carcinogen, etc.)
and  not  quantitative  estimates  of  cancer  potency,  which  are  required  to  conduct
quantitative risk assessments.

EPA’s  IRIS  assessment  process  has  undergone  a  number  of  formal  and  informal
changes  during  the  past  several  years.  While  the  process  used  to  develop  IRIS
chemical assessments includes numerous individual steps or activities, major assess-
ment steps include (1) a review of the scientific literature; (2) preparation of a draft
IRIS assessment; (3) internal EPA reviews of draft assessments; (4) two OMB/inter-
agency  reviews,  managed  by  OMB,  that  provide  input  from  OMB  as  well  as  from
other federal agencies, including those that may be affected by the IRIS assessments
if they lead to regulatory or other actions; (5) an independent peer review conducted
by  a  panel  of  experts;  and  (6)  the  completion  of  a  final  assessment  that  is  posted
to the IRIS web site.

Unlike  many  other  EPA  programs  that  have  statutory  requirements,  including
specific time frames for completing mandated tasks, the IRIS program is not subject
to  statutory  requirements  or  timeframes.  In  contrast,  the  Department  of  Human
Health  and  Services’  Agency  for  Toxic  Substances  and  Disease  Registry  (ATSDR),

which  develops  quantitative  estimates  of  the  non-cancer  effects  of  exposures  to
chemicals  in  the  environment,  is  statutorily  required  to  complete  its  assessments
within certain timeframes.

Findings  and  Recommendations  from  Our  March  2008  Report  on  the  Pro-
ductivity  and  Credibility  of  EPA’s  Integrated  Risk  Information
System

The IRIS database is at serious risk of becoming obsolete because the agency has
not been able to routinely complete timely, credible assessments or decrease a back-
log of 70 ongoing assessments. Specifically, although EPA has taken important steps
to improve the IRIS program and productivity since 2000 and has developed a num-
ber  of  draft  assessments  for  external  review,  its  efforts  to  finalize  the  assessments
have been thwarted by a combination of factors including the imposition of external
requirements,  the  growing  complexity  and  scope  of  risk  assessments,  and  certain
EPA  management  decisions.  In  addition,  the  changes  to  the  IRIS  assessment  proc-
ess  that  EPA  was  considering  at  the  time  of  our  review  would  have  added  to  the
already  unacceptable  level  of  delays  in  completing  IRIS  assessments  and  further
limited the credibility of the assessments.

EPA’s  Efforts  to  Improve  the  IRIS  Assessment  Program  Have  Not  Produced  the  De-

sired Results

EPA has taken a number of steps to help ensure that IRIS contains current, cred-
ible  chemical  risk  information;  to  address  its  backlog  of  ongoing  assessments;  and
to  respond  to  new  OMB  requirements.  However,  to  date,  these  changes—including
increasing  funding,  centralizing  staff  conducting  assessments,  and  revising  the  as-
sessment process—have not enabled EPA to routinely complete credible IRIS assess-
ments or decrease the backlog. That is, although EPA sent 32 draft assessments for
external  review  in  fiscal  years  2006  and  2007,  the  agency  finalized  only  four  IRIS
assessments during this time (see Fig. 2).

Several  key  factors  have  contributed  to  EPA’s  inability  to  achieve  a  level  of  pro-
ductivity  that  is  needed  to  sustain  the  IRIS  program  and  database:  new  OMB-re-
quired reviews of IRIS assessments by OMB and other federal agencies; the growing
complexity  and  scope  of  risk  assessments;  certain  EPA  management  decisions  and
issues, including delaying completion of some assessments to await new research or
to  develop  enhanced  analyses  of  uncertainty  in  the  assessments;  and  the
compounding  effect  of  delays.  Regarding  the  last  factor,  even  a  single  delay  in  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:30 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042370 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\I&O08\052108\42370 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

20

assessment  process  can  lead  to  the  need  to  essentially  repeat  the  assessment  proc-
ess to take into account changes in science and methodologies.

A  variety  of  delays  have  impacted  the  majority  of  the  70  assessments  being  con-
ducted  as  of  December  2007—48  had  been  in  process  for  more  than  five  years,  and
12  of  those  for  more  than  nine  years.  These  time  frames  are  problematic  because
of  the  substantial  rework  such  cases  often  require  to  take  into  account  changing
science and methodologies before they can be completed. For example, EPA’s assess-
ment of the cancer risks stemming from exposure to naphthalene—a chemical used
in  jet  fuel  and  in  the  production  of  widely  used  commercial  products  such  as  moth
balls, dyes, insecticides, and plasticizers—was nearing completion in 2006. However,
prior to finalizing this assessment, which had been ongoing for over four years, EPA
decided  that  the  existing  non-cancer  assessment  had  become  outdated  and  essen-
tially  restarted  the  assessment  to  include  both  cancer  and  non-cancer  effects.  As  a
result,  six  years  after  the  naphthalene  assessment  began,  it  is  now  back  at  the
drafting stage. The assessment now will need to reflect relevant research completed
since  the  draft  underwent  initial  external  peer  review  in  2004,  and  it  will  have  to
undergo  all  of  the  IRIS  assessment  steps  again,  including  the  additional  internal
and external reviews that are now required (see Appendix I).

Further,  because  EPA  staff  time  continues  to  be  dedicated  to  completing  assess-
ments in the backlog, EPA’s ability to both keep the more than 540 existing assess-
ments  up  to  date  and  initiate  new  assessments  is  limited.  Importantly,  EPA  pro-
gram  offices  and  State  and  local  entities  have  requested  assessments  of  hundreds
of  chemicals  not  yet  in  IRIS,  and  EPA  data  as  of  2003  indicated  that  the  assess-
ments  of  287  chemicals  in  the  database  may  be  outdated—that  is,  new  information
could  change  the  risk  estimates  currently  in  IRIS  or  enable  EPA  to  develop  addi-
tional risk estimates for chemicals in the database (for example, developing a cancer
potency  estimate  for  assessments  with  only  non-cancer  estimates).  In  addition,  be-
cause  EPA’s  2003  data  are  now  more  than  four  years  old,  it  is  likely  that  more  as-
sessments may be outdated now.

The consequences of not having current, credible IRIS information can be signifi-
cant.  EPA’s  inability  to  complete  its  assessment  of  formaldehyde,  which  the  agency
initiated  in  1997  to  update  information  already  in  IRIS  on  the  chemical,  has  had
a  significant  impact  on  EPA’s  air  toxics  program.  Although  in  2003  and  2004,  the
National  Cancer  Institute  and  the  National  Institute  of  Occupational  Safety  and
Health (NIOSH) had released updates to major epidemiological studies of industrial
workers  that  showed  a  relationship  between  formaldehyde  and  certain  cancers,  in-
cluding  leukemia,  EPA  did  not  move  forward  to  finalize  an  IRIS  assessment  incor-
porating  these  important  data.  Instead,  EPA  opted  to  await  the  results  of  another
update  to  the  National  Cancer  Institute  study.  While  this  additional  research  was
originally  estimated  to  take,  at  most,  18  months  to  complete,  at  the  time  of  our  re-
port  (more  than  three  years  later)  the  update  was  not  complete.  In  the  absence  of
this  information,  EPA’s  Office  of  Air  and  Radiation  decided  to  use  risk  information
developed  by  an  industry-funded  organization—the  CIIT  Centers  for  Health  Re-
search—for  a  national  emissions  standard.  This  decision  was  a  factor  in  EPA  ex-
empting  certain  facilities  with  formaldehyde  emissions  from  the  national  emissions
standard.  The  CIIT  risk  estimate  indicates  a  potency  about  2,400  times  lower  than
the  estimate  in  IRIS  that  was  being  re-evaluated  and  that  did  not  yet  consider  the
2003  and  2004  National  Cancer  Institute  and  NIOSH  epidemiological  studies.  Ac-
cording  to  an  EPA  official,  an  IRIS  cancer  risk  factor  based  on  the  2003  and  2004
National  Cancer  Institute  and  NIOSH  studies  would  likely  be  close  to  the  current
IRIS assessment, which EPA has been reevaluating since 1997. The discrepancy be-
tween  these  two  risk  estimates  raises  concerns  about  whether  the  public  health  is
adequately  protected  in  the  absence  of  current  IRIS  information.  For  example,  in
1999,  EPA  published  a  national  assessment  that  provided  information  about  the
types and amounts of air toxics to which people are exposed. The assessment, which
also  used  the  CIIT  risk  estimate  for  formaldehyde,  concluded,  for  example,  that
formaldehyde did not contribute significantly to the overall cancer risk in the State
of  New  Jersey.  However,  in  carrying  out  its  own  risk  assessment  on  formaldehyde,
the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection opted to use the risk infor-
mation that is currently in IRIS (dating back to 1991) and found that the contribu-
tion from formaldehyde to overall cancer risk in New Jersey is quite significant, sec-
ond  only  to  diesel  particulate  matter.  (Appendix  I  provides  additional  information
on EPA’s IRIS assessment for formaldehyde.)

One of the factors that has contributed to EPA’s inability to complete assessments
in  a  timely  manner—the  new  OMB-directed  OMB/interagency  review  process—also
limits  the  credibility  of  the  assessments  because  it  lacks  transparency.  Specifically,
neither  the  comments  nor  the  changes  EPA  makes  to  the  scientific  IRIS  assess-
ments  in  response  to  the  comments  made  by  OMB  and  other  federal  agencies,  in-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:30 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042370 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\I&O08\052108\42370 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

21

cluding  those  whose  workload  and  resource  levels  could  be  affected  by  the  assess-
ments,  are  disclosed.  In  addition,  the  OMB/interagency  reviews  have  hindered
EPA’s  ability  to  independently  manage  its  IRIS  assessments.  For  example,  without
communicating its rationale for doing so, OMB directed EPA to terminate five IRIS
assessments that for the first time addressed acute, rather than chronic exposure—
even  though  EPA  initiated  this  type  of  assessment  to  help  it  implement  the  Clean
Air Act.

The  Expansion  of  Agencies’  Roles  in  IRIS  Assessments  That  EPA  Was  Considering
at the Time of Our Review Would Have Caused Further Delays and Limited the
Assessments’ Credibility

For  our  March  2008  report,  we  reviewed  the  additional  assessment  process
changes  EPA  was  planning  and  concluded  that  they  would  likely  exacerbate  delays
in  completing  IRIS  assessments  and  further  affect  their  credibility.  Specifically,  de-
spite  the  OMB/interagency  review  process  that  OMB  required  EPA  to  incorporate
into  the  IRIS  assessment  process  in  2005,  certain  federal  agencies  continued  to  be-
lieve they should have greater and more formal roles in EPA’s development of IRIS
assessments.  Consequently,  EPA  had  been  working  for  several  years  to  establish  a
formal IRIS assessment process that would further expand the role of federal agen-
cies in the process—including agencies such as DOD, which could be affected by the
outcome  of  IRIS  assessments.  For  example,  some  of  these  agencies  and  their  con-
tractors  could  face  increased  cleanup  costs  and  other  legal  liabilities  if  EPA  issued
an IRIS assessment for a chemical that resulted in a decision to regulate the chem-
ical to protect the public. In addition, the agencies could be required to, for example,
redesign  systems  and  processes  to  eliminate  hazardous  materials;  develop  material
substitutes;  and  improve  personal  protective  clothing,  equipment,  and  procedures.
Under  the  changes  that  EPA  was  planning  at  the  time  of  our  review,  these  poten-
tially  affected  agencies  would  have  the  opportunity  to  be  involved,  or  provide  some
form  of  input,  at  almost  every  step  of  EPA’s  IRIS  assessment  process.  Most  signifi-
cantly, the changes would have provided federal agencies, including those facing po-
tential  regulatory  liability,  with  several  opportunities  during  the  IRIS  assessment
process to subject particular chemicals of interest to additional process steps. These
additional  process  steps,  which  would  have  lengthened  assessment  times  consider-
ably, include:

• giving federal agencies and the public 45 days to identify additional informa-
tion on a chemical for EPA’s consideration in its assessment or to correct any
errors on an additional assessment draft that would provide qualitative infor-
mation;3
• giving  potentially  affected  federal  agencies  30  days  to  review  the  public  com-
ments EPA received and initiate a meeting with EPA if they want to discuss
a particular set of comments;
• allowing  potentially  affected  federal  agencies  to  have  assessments  suspended
for up to 18 months to fill a data gap or eliminate an uncertainty factor that
EPA plans to use in its assessment; and
• allowing  other  federal  agencies  to  weigh  in  on  (1)  the  level  of  independent
peer  review  that  would  be  sought  (that  is,  whether  the  peer  reviews  would
be  conducted  by  EPA  Science  Advisory  Board  panels,  National  Academies’
panels,  or  panels  organized  by  an  EPA  contractor);  (2)  the  areas  of  scientific
expertise  needed  on  the  panel;  and  (3)  the  scope  of  the  peer  reviews  and  the
specific issues they would address.

EPA  estimated  that  assessments  that  undergo  these  additional  process  steps
would take up to six years to complete. While it is important to ensure that assess-
ments  consider  the  best  science,  EPA  has  acknowledged  that  waiting  for  new  data
can  result  in  substantial  harm  to  human  health,  safety,  and  the  environment.  Fur-
ther,  although  coordination  with  other  federal  agencies  about  IRIS  assessments
could  enhance  their  quality,4 increasing  the  role  of  agencies  that  may  be  affected

3 This  represents  an  additional  review  of  a  new  draft  product  and  comment  period  that  had
not  existed  previously.  As  shown  in  Appendix  II,  the  assessment  process  EPA  used  at  the  time
of  our  review  included  publishing  its  annual  IRIS  assessment  agenda  in  the  Federal  Register
and soliciting relevant scientific information from the public.

4 We recommended in our 2006 report on human health risk assessment that EPA consistently
involve  stakeholders  as  appropriate  to  the  risk  assessment.  We  made  this  recommendation  in
the context of improving the overall quality, consistency, and transparency of risk assessments.

by IRIS assessments in the process itself reduces the credibility of the assessments
if  that  expanded  role  is  not  transparent.  In  this  regard,  while  EPA’s  proposed
changes  would  have  allowed  for  including  federal  agencies’  comments  in  the  public
record, the implementation of this proposal was delayed for a year, in part, because
of  OMB’s  view  that  agencies’  comments  about  IRIS  assessments  represent  internal
executive  branch  communications  that  may  not  be  made  public—a  view  that  is  in-
consistent  with  the  principle  of  sound  science,  which  relies  on,  among  other  things,
transparency. (Appendix II and III provide flow charts of the IRIS process that was
in place at the time of our review and EPA’s draft proposed process being considered
at the time of our review, respectively).

Recommendations Made in Our March 2008 Report

To address the productivity and credibility issues we identified, we recommended
that  the  EPA  Administrator  require  the  Office  of  Research  and  Development  to  re-
evaluate  its  draft  proposed  changes  to  the  IRIS  assessment  process  in  light  of  the
issues raised in our report and ensure that any revised process, among other things,
clearly  defines  and  documents  an  IRIS  assessment  process  that  will  enable  the
agency  to  develop  the  timely  chemical  risk  information  it  needs  to  effectively  con-
duct its mission. One of our recommendations—that EPA provide at least two years’
notice  of  IRIS  assessments  that  are  planned—would,  among  other  things,  provide
an  efficient  alternative  to  suspending  assessments  while  waiting  for  new  research
because interested parties would have the opportunity to conduct research before as-
sessments are started.

In addition, we recommended that the EPA Administrator take steps to better en-
sure  that  EPA  has  the  ability  to  develop  transparent,  credible  IRIS  assessments—
an  ability  that  relies  in  large  part  on  EPA’s  independence  in  conducting  these  im-
portant assessments. Actions that are key to this ability include ensuring that EPA
can  (1)  determine  the  types  of  assessments  it  needs  to  support  EPA  programs  and
(2) define the appropriate role of external federal agencies in EPA’s IRIS assessment
process,  and  (3)  manage  an  interagency  review  process  in  a  manner  that  enhances
the  quality,  transparency,  timeliness,  and  credibility  of  IRIS  assessments.  In  its
February 21, 2008, letter providing comments on our draft report, EPA said it would
consider  each  of  our  recommendations  in  light  of  the  new  IRIS  process  the  agency
was developing.

Key Aspects of the Revised IRIS Assessment Process Implemented in April

2008 Which Is Not Responsive to GAO’s Recommendations

On April 10, 2008, EPA issued a revised IRIS assessment process, effective imme-
diately.  Overall,  EPA’s  revised  process  is  not  responsive  to  the  recommendations
made in our March 2008 report—it is largely the same as the draft proposed process
we  evaluated  in  our  March  2008  report  (see  Appendix  III  and  IV).  Moreover,
changes  EPA  did  incorporate  into  the  final  process  are  likely  to  further  exacerbate
the productivity and credibility issues we identified in our report.
• We  recommended  that  EPA  ensure  that,  among  other  things,  any  revised  process
clearly  defines  and  documents  a  streamlined  IRIS  assessment  process  that  can  be
conducted within time frames that minimize the need for wasteful rework.
As  discussed  in  our  report,  when  assessments  take  longer  than  two  years,  they
can become subject to substantial delays stemming from the need to redo key anal-
yses to take into account changing science and assessment methodologies. However,
EPA’s revised process institutionalizes a process that the agency estimates will take
up to six years to complete. Further, the estimated time frames do not factor in the
time  for  peer  reviews  conducted  by  the  National  Academies,  which  can  take  two
years to plan and complete.5 EPA typically uses reviews by the National Academies
for  highly  controversial  chemicals  or  complex  assessments.  Therefore,  assessments
of key chemicals of concern to public health that are reviewed by the National Acad-
emies  are  likely  to  take  at  least  eight  years  to  complete.  These  time  frames  must
also be considered in light of OMB’s view that health assessment values in IRIS are
out  of  date  if  they  are  more  than  10  years  old  and  if  new  scientific  information  ex-
ists that could change the health assessment values. Thus, EPA’s new process insti-
tutionalizes  time  frames  that  could  essentially  require  the  agency  to  start  assess-

provements  Needed  in  Planning,  Data  Development,  and  Training,  GAO–06–595  (Washington,
D.C.: May 31, 2006).

5 It is not clear whether the time frames exclude reviews conducted by EPA’s Science Advisory
Board, which can also add considerably more time than the most basic level of peer review used
by the IRIS program—panels organized by an EPA contractor.

ment updates as soon as two years after assessments are finalized in order to keep
the  IRIS  database  current.  Such  time  frames  are  not  consistent  with  our  rec-
ommendation  that  EPA  develop,  clearly  define,  and  document  a  streamlined  IRIS
process that can be conducted within time frames that minimize the need for waste-
ful  rework.  Further,  the  agency  would  need  a  significant  increase  in  resources  to
support such an assessment cycle.

In  addition,  EPA  had  previously  emphasized  that,  in  suspending  assessments  to
allow  agencies  to  fill  in  data  gaps,  it  would  allow  no  more  than  18  months  to  com-
plete  the  studies  and  have  them  peer  reviewed.  However,  under  the  new  process,
EPA  states  that  it  generally  will  allow  no  more  than  18  months  to  complete  the
studies and have them peer reviewed. As we concluded in our report, we believe the
ability to suspend assessments for up to 18 months would add to the already unac-
ceptable  level  of  delays  in  completing  IRIS  assessments.  Further,  we  and  several
agency officials with whom we spoke believe that the time needed to plan, conduct,
and  complete  research  that  would  address  significant  data  gaps,  and  have  it  peer
reviewed,  would  likely  exceed  18  months.  Therefore,  the  less  rigid  time  frame  EPA
included in its new process could result in additional delays.

Finally, the new process expands the scope of one of the additional steps that ini-
tially was to apply only to chemicals of particular interest to federal agencies.6 Spe-
cifically,  under  the  draft  process  we  reviewed,  EPA  would  have  provided  an  addi-
tional review and comment opportunity for federal agencies and the public for what
EPA officials said would be a small group of chemicals. However, under EPA’s new
process, this additional step has been added to the assessment process for all chemi-
cals  and,  therefore,  will  add  time  to  the  already  lengthy  assessments  of  all  chemi-
cals.
• We also recommended that the EPA Administrator take steps to better ensure that
EPA  has  the  ability  to  develop  transparent,  credible  IRIS  assessments—an  ability
that  relies  in  large  part  on  EPA’s  independence  in  conducting  these  important  as-
sessments.
Contrary to our recommendation, EPA has formalized a revised IRIS process that
is  selectively,  rather  than  fully,  transparent,  limiting  the  credibility  of  the  assess-
ments. Specifically, while the draft process we reviewed provided that comments on
IRIS assessments from OMB and other federal agencies would be part of the public
record, under the recently implemented process, comments from federal agencies are
expressly  defined  as  ‘‘deliberative’’  and  will  not  be  included  in  the  public  record.7
Given  the  importance  and  sensitivity  of  IRIS  assessments,  we  believe  it  is  critical
that  input  from  all  parties,  particularly  agencies  that  may  be  affected  by  the  out-
come of IRIS assessments, be publicly available. However, under EPA’s new process,
input from some IRIS assessment reviewers—representatives of federal agencies, in-
cluding  those  facing  potential  regulatory  liability,  and  private  stakeholders  associ-
ated  with  these  agencies—will  continue  to  receive  less  public  scrutiny  than  com-
ments from all others.

In commenting on a draft of our March 2008 report, and in a recent congressional
hearing, EPA’s Assistant Administrator, Office of Research and Development, stated
that the IRIS process is transparent because all final IRIS assessments must under-
go  public  and  external  peer  review.  However,  as  we  stated  in  our  report,  the  pres-
ence  of  transparency  at  a  later  stage  of  IRIS  assessment  development  does  not  ex-
plain  or  excuse  its  absence  earlier.  Under  the  new  process,  neither  peer  reviewers
nor  the  public  are  privy  to  the  changes  EPA  makes  in  response  to  the  comments
OMB and other federal agencies provide to EPA at several stages in the assessment
process—changes to draft assessments or to the questions EPA poses to the peer re-
view  panels.  Importantly,  the  first  IRIS  assessment  draft  that  is  released  to  peer
reviewers and to the public includes the undisclosed input from federal agencies po-
tentially  subject  to  regulation  and  therefore  with  an  interest  in  minimizing  the  im-
pacts of IRIS assessments on their budgets and operations.

In addition, EPA’s revised process does not provide EPA with sufficient independ-
ence  in  developing  IRIS  assessments  to  ensure  they  are  credible  and  transparent.
We made several recommendations aimed at restoring EPA’s independence. For ex-
ample, we recommended that the EPA Administrator ensure that EPA has the abil-

6 The new IRIS assessment process refers to such chemicals as ‘‘mission critical.’’ The process
defines  a  mission-critical  chemical  as  one  that  ‘‘is  an  integral  component  to  the  successful  and
safe conduct of an agency’s mission in any or all phases of its operations.’’ According to the proc-
ess, ‘‘impacts on the use of mission-critical chemicals include cessation or degradation of the con-
duct of the mission and/or unacceptable resource constraints.’’

7 Making these comments public would have been a change from the OMB/interagency review

process that has been in place since 2004.

ity  to,  among  other  things,  define  the  appropriate  role  of  external  federal  agencies
in  the  IRIS  assessment  process  and  determine  when  interagency  issues  have  been
appropriately  addressed.  However,  under  the  newly  implemented  IRIS  assessment
process, OMB continues to inform EPA when EPA has adequately addressed OMB’s
and  interagency  comments.  This  determination  must  be  made  both  before  EPA  can
provide  draft  assessments  to  external  peer  reviewers  and  to  the  public  and  before
EPA  can  finalize  and  post  assessments  on  the  IRIS  database.  While  EPA  officials
state  that  ultimately  IRIS  assessments  reflect  EPA  decisions,  the  new  process  does
not  support  this  assertion  given  the  clearances  EPA  needs  to  receive  from  OMB  to
move  forward  at  key  stages.  In  fact,  we  believe  the  new  IRIS  assessment  process
may  elevate  the  goal  of  reaching  interagency  agreement  above  achieving  IRIS  pro-
gram  objectives.  Further,  as  discussed  above,  because  the  negotiations  over  OMB/
interagency comments are not disclosed, whether EPA is entirely responsible for the
content of information on IRIS is open to question.

In  our  report,  we  also  emphasized  the  importance  of  ensuring  that  IRIS  assess-
ments be based solely on science issues and not policy concerns. However, under the
new IRIS assessment process, EPA has further introduced policy considerations into
the IRIS assessment process. That is, the newly implemented IRIS assessment proc-
ess  broadens  EPA’s  characterization  of  IRIS  assessments  from  ‘‘the  agency’s  sci-
entific positions on human health effects that may result from exposure to environ-
mental contaminants’’ to ‘‘the agency’s science and science policy positions’’ on such
effects. EPA’s new, broader characterization of IRIS raises concerns about the agen-
cy’s  stated  intent  to  ensure  that  scientific  assessments  are  appropriately  based  on
the  best  available  science  and  that  they  are  not  inappropriately  impacted  by  policy
issues  and  considerations.  For  example,  in  discussing  science  and  science  policy  at
a  recent  Senate  hearing,  EPA’s  Assistant  Administrator  of  Research  and  Develop-
ment  described  science  policy  considerations  as  including  decisions  about  filling
knowledge  gaps  (e.g.,  whether  and  to  what  extent  to  use  default  assumptions)  and
assessing  weight-of-the-evidence  approaches  to  make  scientific  inferences  or  as-
sumptions. We believe that these are scientific decisions that should reflect the best
judgment of EPA scientists who are evaluating the data, using the detailed risk as-
sessment  guidance  the  agency  has  developed  for  such  purposes.  We  have  concerns
about  the  manner  and  extent  to  which  other  federal  agencies,  including  those  that
may  be  affected  by  the  outcome  of  assessments,  are  involved  in  these  decisions  as
well as the lack of transparency of their input. As we highlighted earlier, under the
National Academies’ risk assessment and risk management paradigm, policy consid-
erations are relevant in the risk management phase—which occurs after the risk as-
sessment  phase  that  encompasses  IRIS  assessments.  The  National  Academies  re-
cently  addressed  this  issue  as  follows:  ‘‘The  committee  believes  that  risk  assessors
and  risk  managers  should  talk  with  each  other;  that  is,  a  ‘conceptual  distinction’
does not mean establishing a wall between risk assessors and risk managers. Indeed
they should have constant interaction. However, the dialogue should not bias or oth-
erwise  color  the  risk  assessment  conducted,  and  the  activities  should  remain  dis-
tinct; that is, risk assessors should not be performing risk management activities.’’ 8

Concluding Observations

The  new  IRIS  assessment  process  that  EPA  implemented  in  April  2008  will  not
allow  the  agency  to  routinely  and  timely  complete  credible  assessments.  In  fact,  it
will  exacerbate  the  problems  we  identified  in  our  March  2008  report  and  sought  to
address  with  our  recommendations—all  of  which  were  aimed  at  preserving  the  via-
bility  of  this  critical  database,  which  is  integral  to  EPA’s  mission  of  protecting  the
public and the environment from exposure to toxic chemicals. Specifically, under the
new  process,  assessment  time  frames  will  be  significantly  lengthened,  and  the  lack
of  transparency  will  further  limit  the  credibility  of  the  assessments  because  input
from  OMB  and  other  agencies  at  all  stages  of  the  IRIS  assessment  process  is  now
expressly defined as deliberative and therefore not subject to public disclosure. The
position  of  the  Assistant  Administrator,  Office  of  Research  and  Development,  that
the  IRIS  process  is  transparent  because  all  final  IRIS  assessments  must  undergo
public  and  external  peer  review  is  unconvincing.  Transparency  at  a  later  stage  of
the IRIS assessment process—after OMB and other federal agencies have had mul-
tiple opportunities to influence the content of the assessment without any disclosure
of their input—does not compensate for its absence earlier.

We continue to believe that to effectively maintain IRIS EPA must streamline its
lengthy  assessment  process  and  adopt  transparency  practices  that  provide  assur-

ance  that  IRIS  assessments  are  appropriately  based  on  the  best  available  science
and that they are not inappropriately biased by policy issues and considerations. As
discussed in our April 29, 2008, testimony before the Senate Environment and Pub-
lic  Works  Committee,  we  believe  that  the  Congress  should  consider  requiring  EPA
to  suspend  implementation  of  its  new  IRIS  assessment  process  and  develop  a
streamlined  process  that  is  transparent  and  otherwise  responsive  to  our  rec-
ommendations  aimed  at  improving  the  timeliness  and  credibility  of  IRIS  assess-
ments.9 For example, suspending assessments to obtain additional research is ineffi-
cient; alternatively, with longer-term planning, EPA could provide agencies and the
public with more advance notice of assessments, enabling them to complete relevant
research before IRIS assessments are started.

In  addition,  as  discussed  in  our  April  2008  testimony,  the  Congress  should  con-
sider requiring EPA to obtain and be responsive to input from the Congress and the
public before finalizing a revised IRIS assessment process. We note that while EPA
and  OMB  initially  had  planned  for  EPA  to  release  a  draft  revised  IRIS  assessment
process to the public, hold a public meeting to discuss EPA’s proposed changes, and
seek and incorporate public input before finalizing the process, EPA released its new
assessment  process  without  obtaining  public  input  and  made  it  effective  imme-
diately. This was inconsistent with assertions made in OMB’s letter commenting on
our  draft  report,  which  emphasized  that  EPA  had  not  completed  the  development
of the IRIS assessment process and stated: ‘‘Indeed, the process will not be complete
until  EPA  circulates  its  draft  to  the  public  for  comments  and  then  releases  a  final
product that is responsive to those comments.’’

Finally,  if  EPA  is  not  able  to  take  the  steps  we  have  recommended  to  effectively
maintain  this  critical  program,  other  approaches,  including  statutory  requirements,
may need to be explored.

Mr.  Chairman,  this  concludes  my  prepared  statement.  I  would  be  happy  to  re-
spond  to  any  questions  that  you  or  other  Members  of  the  Subcommittee  may  have
at this time.

Examples of Key IRIS Assessments That Have Been Delayed

Some key IRIS assessments have been in progress for a number of years, in part
because  of  delays  stemming  from  one  or  more  of  the  key  factors  we  identified  that
have hindered EPA’s productivity.10 Examples include the following:
Naphthalene. EPA started the IRIS assessment of cancer risks stemming from the
inhalation  of  naphthalene  in  2002.  Naphthalene  is  used  in  jet  fuel  and  in  the  pro-
duction  of  widely  used  commercial  products  such  as  moth  balls,  dyes,  insecticides,
and  plasticizers.  According  to  a  presentation  delivered  at  the  2007  annual  meeting
of the Society for Risk Analysis by an Army Corps of Engineers toxicologist,11 ‘‘The
changing naphthalene regulatory environment includes a draft EPA risk assessment
that  if/when  finalized,  will  change  naphthalene’s  status  from  ‘possible’  to  ‘likely’
human  carcinogen.’’ 12 Thus,  according  to  this  presentation,  one  potential  impact  of
this  IRIS  assessment  on  DOD  is  that  DOD  would  need  to  provide  many  employees
exposed  to  naphthalene  with  equipment  measuring  their  exposure  to  the  chemical.
In  addition,  because  many  military  bases  are  contaminated  with  naphthalene,  a
component of jet fuel (approximately one percent to three percent) used by all DOD
services,  DOD  could  face  extensive  cleanup  costs.  By  2004,  two  years  after  starting
the  assessment,  EPA  had  drafted  a  chemical  assessment  that  had  completed  inter-
nal  peer  reviews  and  was  about  to  be  sent  to  an  external  peer  review  committee.
Once it returned from external review, the next step, at that time, would have been
a  formal  review  by  EPA’s  IRIS  Agency  Review  Committee.  If  approved,  the  assess-
ment  would  have  been  completed  and  released.  However,  in  part  because  of  con-
cerns raised by DOD, OMB asked to review the assessment and conducted an inter-
agency review of the draft. In their 2004 reviews of the draft IRIS assessment, both
OMB  and  DOD  raised  a  number  of  concerns  about  the  assessment  and  suggested
to EPA that it be suspended until additional research could be completed to address
what they considered to be significant uncertainties associated with the assessment.
Although all of the issues raised by OMB and DOD were not resolved, EPA contin-
ued with its assessment by submitting the draft for external peer review, which was
completed  in  September  2004.13 However,  according  to  EPA,  OMB  continued  to  ob-
ject to the draft IRIS assessment and directed EPA to convene an additional expert
review panel on genotoxicity to obtain recommendations about short-term tests that
OMB  thought  could  be  done  quickly.14 According  to  EPA,  this  added  six  months  to
the  process,  and  the  panel,  which  met  in  April  2005,  concluded  that  the  research
that  OMB  was  proposing  could  not  be  conducted  in  the  short-term.  Nonetheless,
EPA officials said that the second expert panel review did not eliminate OMB’s con-
cerns  regarding  the  assessment,  which  they  described  as  reaching  a  stalemate.  In
September 2006, EPA decided, however, to proceed with developing the assessment.
By this time, the naphthalene assessment had been in progress for over four years;
EPA  decided  that  the  IRIS  non-cancer  assessment,  issued  in  1998,  was  outdated
and  needed  to  be  revisited.  Thus,  EPA  expanded  the  IRIS  naphthalene  assessment
to  include  both  non-cancer  and  cancer  assessments.  As  a  result,  six  years  after  the
naphthalene assessment began, it is now back at the drafting stage. The assessment
now  will  need  to  reflect  relevant  research  completed  since  the  draft  underwent  ini-

10 The  factors  we  identified  that  have  hindered  EPA’s  efforts  to  improve  productivity  are  the
OMB/interagency  review  process  managed  by  OMB,  the  growing  complexity  and  scope  of  risk
assessments,  certain  management  decisions  and  issues  regarding  the  IRIS  program,  congres-
sional  action  that  has  delayed  some  assessments  with  potentially  significant  economic  effects,
and the compounding effect of delays.

11 Presentations at the Society for Risk Analysis meeting reflect the views of the authors and

‘‘do not necessarily reflect the views of any other organization or agency.’’

12 Using its 1996 Proposed Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment, EPA concluded in the
1998 IRIS assessment of naphthalene that its human carcinogenic potential could not be deter-
mined  at  that  time,  but  noted  that  there  was  suggestive  evidence  of  potential  human  carcino-
genicity.  (EPA  also  noted  that  under  its  1986  cancer  guidelines,  EPA  classified  naphthalene  as
a possible human carcinogen.) Subsequently, in 2002, the International Agency for Research on
Cancer  (IARC),  part  of  the  World  Health  Organization,  concluded  that  naphthalene  is  possibly
carcinogenic to humans; in 2004, the Department of Human Health and Services’ National Toxi-
cology  Program  concluded  that  naphthalene  can  reasonably  be  anticipated  to  be  a  human  car-
cinogen. EPA’s current assessment will be subject to the agency’s 2005 cancer guidelines.

13 According  to  DOD,  EPA  did  not  specifically  ask  the  peer  reviewers  to  address  some  of  the

technical questions DOD had raised and wanted the peer review to address.

14 Genotoxic  substances  are  a  type  of  carcinogen,  specifically  those  capable  of  causing  genetic
mutation and of contributing to the development of tumors. This includes both certain chemical
compounds and certain types of radiation.

tial external peer review in 2004, and it will have to undergo all of the IRIS assess-
ment  steps  again,  including  additional  internal  and  external  reviews  that  are  now
required.  This  series  of  delays  has  limited  EPA’s  ability  to  conduct  its  mission.  For
example, the Office of Air and Radiation has identified the naphthalene assessment
as one of its highest-priority needs for its air toxics program. In addition, the Office
of  Solid  Waste  and  Emergency  Response  considers  the  naphthalene  assessment  a
high  priority  for  the  Superfund  program—naphthalene  has  been  found  in  at  least
654 of Superfund’s current or former National Priorities List sites.15 Although EPA
currently  estimates  that  it  will  complete  the  assessment  in  2009,  meeting  this  re-
vised estimate will be challenging, given all of the steps that are yet to be completed
and the extensive external scrutiny to which it will continue to be subjected.
Royal  Demolition  Explosive.  This  chemical,  also  called  RDX  or  hexahydro-1,3,5-
trinitrotriazine,  is  a  highly  powerful  explosive  used  by  the  U.S.  military  in  thou-
sands  of  munitions.  Currently  classified  by  EPA  as  a  possible  human  carcinogen,
this  chemical  is  known  to  leach  from  soil  to  groundwater.  Royal  Demolition  Explo-
sive can cause seizures in humans and animals when large amounts are inhaled or
ingested, but the effects of long-term, low-level exposure on the nervous system are
unknown.  As  is  the  case  with  naphthalene,  the  IRIS  assessment  could  potentially
require  DOD  to  undertake  a  number  of  actions,  including  steps  to  protect  its  em-
ployees  from  the  effects  of  this  chemical  and  to  clean  up  many  contaminated  sites.
Although  EPA  started  an  IRIS  assessment  of  Royal  Demolition  Explosive  in  2000,
it  has  made  minimal  progress  on  the  assessment  because  EPA  agreed  to  a  request
by  DOD  to  wait  for  the  results  of  DOD-sponsored  research  on  this  chemical.  In
2007,  EPA  began  to  actively  work  on  this  assessment,  although  some  of  the  DOD-
sponsored research is still outstanding.
Formaldehyde.  EPA  began  an  IRIS  assessment  of  formaldehyde  in  1997  because
the  existing  assessment  was  determined  to  be  outdated.16 Formaldehyde  is  a  color-
less,  flammable,  strong-smelling  gas  used  to  manufacture  building  materials,  such
as  pressed  wood  products,  and  used  in  many  household  products,  including  paper,
pharmaceuticals, and leather goods. While EPA currently classifies formaldehyde as
a  probable  human  carcinogen,  the  International  Agency  for  Research  on  Cancer
(IARC), part of the World Health Organization, classifies formaldehyde as a known
human carcinogen. Since 1986, studies of industrial of workers have suggested that
formaldehyde exposure is associated with nasopharyngeal cancer, and possibly with
leukemia. For example, in 2003 and 2004, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and
the  National  Institute  of  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  (NIOSH)  released  epide-
miological  studies  following  up  on  earlier  studies  tracking  about  26,000  and  11,000
industrial workers, respectively, exposed to formaldehyde; the updates showed expo-
sure to formaldehyde might also cause leukemia in humans, in addition to the can-
cer  types  previously  identified.  According  to  NCI  officials,  the  key  findings  in  their
follow-up study were an increase in leukemia deaths and, more significantly, an ex-
posure/response  relationship  between  formaldehyde  and  leukemia—as  exposure  in-
creased,  the  incidence  of  leukemia  also  rose.  As  with  the  earlier  study,  NCI  found
more  cases  of  a  rare  form  of  cancer,  nasopharyngeal  cancer,  than  would  usually  be
expected.  The  studies  from  NCI  and  NIOSH  were  published  in  2003  and  2004,17
around the time that EPA was still drafting its IRIS assessment. In November 2004,
the  Chairman  of  the  Senate  Environment  and  Public  Works  Committee  requested
that  EPA  delay  completion  of  its  IRIS  assessment  until  an  update  to  the  just-re-
leased NCI study could be conducted, indicating that the effort would take, at most,
18  months.  EPA  agreed  to  wait—and  more  than  three  years  later,  the  NCI  update
is not yet complete. As of December 2007, NCI estimates that the study will be com-
pleted  in  two  stages,  one  in  mid-2008  and  the  second  one  later  that  year.  An  NCI

official  said  that  the  additional  leukemia  deaths  identified  in  the  update  provide
‘‘greater power’’ to detect associations between exposure to formaldehyde and cancer.
EPA’s  inability  to  complete  the  IRIS  assessment  it  started  more  than  10  years  ago
in  a  timely  manner  has  had  a  significant  impact  on  EPA’s  air  toxics  program.  Spe-
cifically,  when  EPA  promulgated  a  national  emissions  standard  for  hazardous  air
pollutants covering facilities in the plywood and composite wood industries in 2004,
EPA’s  Office  of  Air  and  Radiation  took  the  unusual  step  of  not  using  the  existing
IRIS  estimate  but  rather  decided  to  use  a  cancer  risk  estimate  developed  by  an  in-
dustry-funded  organization,  the  CIIT  Centers  for  Health  Research  (formerly,  the
Chemical  Industry  Institute  of  Toxicology)  that  had  been  used  by  the  Canadian
health  protection  agency.  The  IRIS  cancer  risk  factor  had  been  subject  to  criticism
because  it  was  last  revised  in  1991  and  was  based  on  data  from  the  1980s.  In  its
final  rule,  EPA  stated  that  ‘‘the  dose-response  value  in  IRIS  is  based  on  a  1987
study,  and  no  longer  represents  the  best  available  science  in  the  peer-reviewed  lit-
erature.’’  The  CIIT  quantitative  cancer  risk  estimate  that  EPA  used  in  its  health
risk assessment in the plywood and composite wood national emissions standard in-
dicates a potency about 2,400 times lower than the estimate in IRIS that was being
re-evaluated and that did not yet consider the 2003 and 2004 NCI and NIOSH epi-
demiological  studies.  According  to  an  EPA  official,  an  IRIS  cancer  risk  factor  based
on  the  2003  and  2004  NCI  and  NIOSH  studies  would  likely  be  close  to  the  current
IRIS  assessment,  which  EPA  has  been  attempting  to  update  since  1997.  The  deci-
sion  to  use  the  CIIT  assessment  in  the  plywood  national  emissions  standard  was
controversial, and officials in EPA’s National Center for Environmental Assessment
said  the  center  identified  numerous  problems  with  the  CIIT  estimate.  Nonetheless,
the Office of Air and Radiation used the CIIT value, and that decision was a factor
in  EPA  exempting  certain  facilities  with  formaldehyde  emissions  from  the  national
emissions  standard.  In  June  2007,  a  federal  appellate  court  struck  down  the  rule,
holding that EPA’s decision to exempt certain facilities that EPA asserted presented
a  low  health  risk  exceeded  the  agency’s  authority  under  the  Clean  Air  Act.18 Fur-
ther,  the  continued  delays  of  the  IRIS  assessment  of  formaldehyde—currently  esti-
mated  to  be  completed  in  2010  but  after  almost  11  years  still  in  the  draft  develop-
ment stage—will impact the quality of other EPA regulatory actions, including other
air toxics rules and requirements.
Trichloroethylene. Also  known  as  TCE,  this  chemical  is  a  solvent  widely  used  as
a  degreasing  agent  in  industrial  and  manufacturing  settings;  it  is  a  common  envi-
ronmental  contaminant  in  air,  soil,  surface  water,  and  groundwater.  TCE  has  been
linked  to  cancer,  including  childhood  cancer,  and  other  significant  health  hazards,
such  as  birth  defects.  TCE  is  the  most  frequently  reported  organic  contaminant  in
groundwater,  and  contaminated  drinking  water  has  been  found  at  Camp  Lejeune,
a  large  Marine  Corps  base  in  North  Carolina.  TCE  has  also  been  found  at  Super-
fund  sites  and  at  many  industrial  and  government  facilities,  including  aircraft  and
spacecraft  manufacturing  operations.  In  1995,  the  International  Agency  for  Re-
search  on  Cancer  classified  TCE  as  a  probable  human  carcinogen,  and  in  2000,  the
Department of Health and Human Services’ National Toxicology Program concluded
that  it  is  reasonably  anticipated  to  be  a  human  carcinogen.  Because  of  questions
raised by peer reviewers about the IRIS cancer assessment for TCE, EPA withdrew
it  from  IRIS  in  1989  but  did  not  initiate  a  new  TCE  cancer  assessment  until  1998.
In 2001, EPA issued a draft IRIS assessment for TCE that proposed a range of tox-
icity values indicating a higher potency than in the prior IRIS values and character-
izing  TCE  as  ‘‘highly  likely  to  produce  cancer  in  humans.’’  The  draft  assessment,
which  became  controversial,  was  peer  reviewed  by  EPA’s  Scientific  Advisory  Board
and  released  for  public  comment.  A  number  of  scientific  issues  were  raised  during
the  course  of  these  reviews,  including  how  EPA  had  applied  emerging  risk  assess-
ment  methods—such  as  assessing  cumulative  effects  (of  TCE  and  its  metabolites)
and  using  a  physiologically  based  pharmacokinetic  model—and  the  uncertainty  as-
sociated  with  the  new  methods  themselves.19 To  help  address  these  issues,  EPA,
DOD, DOE, and NASA sponsored a National Academies review to provide guidance.
The  National  Academies  report,  which  was  issued  in  2006,  concluded  that  the
weight  of  evidence  of  cancer  and  other  health  risks  from  TCE  exposure  had
strengthened  since  2001  and  recommended  that  the  risk  assessment  be  finalized

18 Natural  Resources  Defense  Council  v.  E.P.A.,  489  F.3d  1364,  1372–73  (D.C.  Cir,  2007).  The
court  did  not  specifically  address  EPA’s  reliance  on  the  CIIT  study,  holding  instead  that  the
Clean Air Act prohibited establishment of the exemptions at issue.

19 Physiologically based pharmacokinetic models are a class of dosimetry models that are use-
ful  for  predicting  internal  doses  to  target  organs.  With  the  appropriate  data,  these  models  can
be used to extrapolate across species and exposure scenarios and address various sources of un-
certainty in risk assessments.

with currently available data so that risk management decisions could be made ex-
peditiously.  The  report  specifically  noted  that  while  some  additional  information
would  allow  for  more  precise  estimates  of  risk,  this  information  was  not  necessary
for  developing  a  credible  risk  assessment.  Nonetheless,  10  years  after  EPA  started
its  IRIS  assessment,  the  TCE  assessment  is  back  at  the  draft  development  stage.
EPA estimates this assessment will be finalized in 2010. More in line with the Na-
tional  Academies’  recommendation  to  act  expeditiously,  five  senators  introduced  a
bill  in  August  2007  that,  among  other  things,  would  require  EPA  to  both  establish
IRIS values for TCE and issue final drinking water standards for this contaminant
within 18 months.
Tetrachloroethylene.  EPA  started  an  IRIS  assessment  of  tetrachloroethylene—
also  called  perchloroethylene  or  ‘‘perc’’—in  1998.  Tetrachloroethylene  is  a  manufac-
tured  chemical  widely  used  for  dry  cleaning  of  fabrics,  metal  degreasing,  and  mak-
ing  some  consumer  products  and  other  chemicals.  Tetrachloroethylene  is  a  wide-
spread groundwater contaminant, and the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices’  National  Toxicology  Program  has  determined  that  it  is  reasonably  anticipated
to be a carcinogen. The IRIS database currently contains a 1988 non-cancer assess-
ment based on oral exposure that will be updated in the ongoing assessment. Impor-
tantly,  the  ongoing  assessment  will  also  provide  a  non-cancer  inhalation  risk  and
a cancer assessment. The IRIS agency review of the draft assessment was completed
in  February  2005,  the  draft  assessment  was  sent  to  OMB  for  OMB/interagency  re-
view in September 2005, and the OMB/interagency review was completed in March
2006.  EPA  had  determined  to  have  the  next  step,  external  peer  review,  conducted
by  the  National  Academies—the  peer  review  choice  reserved  for  chemical  assess-
ments  that  are  particularly  significant  or  controversial.  EPA  contracted  with  the
National Academies for a review by an expert panel, and the review was scheduled
to  start  in  June  2006  and  be  completed  in  15  months.  However,  as  of  December
2007,  the  draft  assessment  had  not  yet  been  provided  to  the  National  Academies.
After  verbally  agreeing  with  both  the  non-cancer  and  cancer  assessments  following
briefings  on  the  assessments,  the  Assistant  Administrator,  Office  of  Research  and
Development,  subsequently  requested  that  additional  uncertainty  analyses—includ-
ing  some  quantitative  analyses—be  conducted  and  included  in  the  assessment  be-
fore the draft was released to the National Academies for peer review. As discussed
in our March 2008 report on IRIS (GAO–08–440), quantitative uncertainty analysis
is a risk assessment tool that is currently being developed, and although the agency
is working on developing policies and procedures for uncertainty analysis, such guid-
ance currently does not exist. The draft tetrachloroethylene assessment has been de-
layed  since  early  2006  as  EPA  staff  have  gone  back  and  forth  with  the  Assistant
Administrator trying to reach agreement on key issues such as whether a linear or
nonlinear model is most appropriate for the cancer assessment and how uncertainty
should  be  qualitatively  and  quantitatively  characterized.  EPA  officials  and  staff
noted  that  some  of  the  most  experienced  staff  are  being  used  for  these  efforts,  lim-
iting  their  ability  to  work  on  other  IRIS  assessments.  In  addition,  the  significant
delay  has  impacted  the  planned  National  Academies  peer  review  because  the  cur-
rent contract, which has already been extended once, cannot be extended beyond De-
cember  2008.  The  peer  review  was  initially  estimated  to  take  15  months.  As  a  re-
sult, a new contract and the appointment of another panel may be required.
Dioxin. The dioxin assessment is an example of an IRIS assessment that has been,
and  will  likely  continue  to  be,  a  political  as  well  as  a  scientific  issue.  Often  the  by-
products  of  combustion  and  other  industrial  processes,  complex  mixtures  of  dioxins
enter  the  food  chain  and  human  diet  through  emissions  into  the  air  that  settle  on
soil,  plants,  and  water.  EPA’s  initial  dioxin  assessment,  published  in  1985,  focused
on  the  dioxin  TCDD  (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin)  because  animal  studies  in
the  1970s  showed  it  to  be  the  most  potent  cancer-causing  chemical  studied  to  date.
Several  years  later,  EPA  decided  to  conduct  a  reassessment  of  dioxin  because  of
major  advances  that  had  occurred  in  the  scientific  understanding  of  dioxin  toxicity
and  significant  new  studies  on  dioxins’  potential  adverse  health  effects.  Initially
started in 1991, this assessment has involved repeated literature searches and peer
reviews.  For  example,  a  draft  of  the  updated  assessment  was  reviewed  by  a  sci-
entific  peer  review  panel  in  1995,  and  three  panels  reviewed  key  segments  of  later
versions  of  the  draft  in  1997  and  2000.  In  2002,  EPA  officials  said  that  the  assess-
ment would conclude that dioxin may adversely affect human health at lower expo-
sure levels than had previously been thought and that most exposure to dioxins oc-
curs  from  eating  such  American  dietary  staples  as  meats,  fish,  and  dairy  products,
which contain minute traces of dioxins. These foods contain dioxins because animals
eat  plants  and  commercial  feed  and  drink  water  contaminated  with  dioxins,  which
then  accumulate  in  animals’  fatty  tissue.  It  is  clear  that  EPA’s  dioxin  risk  assess-

30

ment could have a potentially significant impact on consumers and on the food and
agriculture  industries.  As  EPA  moved  closer  to  finalizing  the  assessment,  in  2003
the  agency  was  directed  in  a  congressional  appropriations  conference  committee  re-
port  to  not  issue  the  assessment  until  it  had  been  reviewed  by  the  National  Acad-
emies. The National Academies provided EPA with a report in July 2006. In devel-
oping  a  response  to  the  report,  which  the  agency  is  currently  doing,  EPA  must  in-
clude  new  studies  and  risk  assessment  approaches  that  did  not  exist  when  the  as-
sessment was drafted. EPA officials said the assessment will be subject to the IRIS
review process once its response to the National Academies’ report is drafted. As of
2008, EPA has been developing the dioxin assessment, which has potentially signifi-
cant health implications for all Americans, for 17 years.

BIOGRAPHY FOR JOHN B. STEPHENSON

John Stephenson has been the Director of Environmental Protection Issues within
GAO’s Natural Resources and Environment team since October 2000. He began his
GAO  career  with  the  Dayton  Field  Office  (formerly  Cincinnati  Regional  Office)
where he focused primarily on acquisition management, defense capabilities, and in-
formation  technology  issues.  In  1987,  he  transferred  to  Headquarters  as  an  Assist-
ant  Director  in  the  Accounting  and  Information  Management  Division  (the  fore-
runner  of  the  IT,  SI,  and  FMA  teams).  In  that  capacity  he  directed  numerous
projects, assisted in several testimonies, and issued over 100 reports on information
technology  issues.  From  April  1998–February  2000,  he  was  detailed  to  the  Senate
Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem where he was the Deputy
Staff  Director.  In  that  capacity,  he  ran  the  day-to-day  operations  of  the  Committee
including  establishing  strategy  and  agendas,  managing  the  staff,  overseeing  inves-
tigations,  conducting  over  35  hearings,  and  representing  the  Chairman  (Senator
Bennett,  R–UT)  and  the  Vice  Chairman  (Senator  Dodd,  D–CT)  in  a  variety  of  fo-
rums.  He  was  appointed  to  GAO’s  Executive  Candidate  Program  in  June  1999.
From March–October 2000, he worked in the Office of the Comptroller General and
directed GAO’s mission support reorganization and realignment project for the Chief
Mission  Support  Officer.  John  holds  a  BS  degree  in  Industrial  Management  from
Purdue  University,  an  MBA  from  Xavier  University,  and  is  a  graduate  of  the  Har-
vard Kennedy School of Government’s Senior Executive Fellows program.

DISCUSSION

THE REVISED IRIS PROCESS

Chairman  MILLER.  Thank  you.  At  this  point,  we  will  have  our
first  round  of  questions.  The  Chair  now  recognizes  himself  for  five
minutes.

I  would  like  to  ask  Mr.  Whittaker  to  display  a  chart,  Figure  1,

if you would, please.

Chairman  MILLER.  Mr.  Stephenson,  displayed  there  is  I  believe
an EPA-prepared chart that describes the IRIS process that existed
before  2004.  Is  that—before  OMB  made  helpful  changes,  helpful
suggestions, about what the process should be instead. Is that cor-
rect?

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  That  looks  like  a  reasonable  representation.

We have a little bit different one in our testimony but——

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Now,  if  Mr.  Whittaker  could  then  dis-

play Figure 3.

Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  Is  that  the  current  process?  That

also is an EPA-prepared document to show their process.

Mr. STEPHENSON. Yes. That looks like some of the new steps that

have been inserted in the new process.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  It  will  be  the  testimony  of  the  later
witnesses today that that process is the streamlined version of the
earlier  process  and  that  we  should  not  believe  our  own  lying  eyes
that  this  really  is  more  streamlined  than  the  previous  process.  Is
it  your  testimony  or  your  belief  that  it  is  in  fact  a  more  com-
plicated, convoluted process, not a streamlined process?

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  It  appears  to  be  more  complicated,  but  if  you
put  the  individual  timeframes  associated  with  each  of  those  steps,
we didn’t invent the six to eight years, it is based on adding up the
amount of time that could be taken for each of those steps and two
years  additional  for  any  chemical  that  is  deemed  mission  critical.
Chairman  MILLER.  But  just  if  our  eyes  tell  us  that  this  looks  a

lot more complicated, our eyes did not lie?

Mr. STEPHENSON. Not in our opinion.

DID OMB REVIEW EPA’S GAO EXIT CONFERENCE

COMMENTS?

Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  Thank  you.  Mr.  Stephenson,  one  of
your  findings  was  that  the  EPA  needed  to  be  more  independent
and that the lack of independence was undermining the credibility
of  IRIS  assessments.  Is  it  your  typical  procedure  to  show  proposed
findings to the agency that you have been examining?

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  Yes,  there  is  a  two-step  process.  Whenever
GAO  completes  a  review,  we  hold  what  we  call  an  exit  conference

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:30 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042370 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O08\052108\42370 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

with  the  affected  agency,  usually  at  the  program  level;  and  it  is
really  a  fact  check,  if  you  will,  to  make  sure  that  we  have  charac-
terized  the  facts  correctly.  We  did  that  and  then  when  we  go  back
and consider those comments, and we publish a draft report which
we  then  pass  by  the  agency  for  official  review.  In  this  case,  we
passed  the  final  report  by  both  EPA  and  OMB  since  both  were  af-
fected.

Chairman MILLER. And what was the result of that review?
Mr. STEPHENSON. Well, the first process is not considered official
agency comments because it isn’t blessed all the way up the chain.
Nevertheless,  it  represents  the  views  of  the  program  office  people
who  run  IRIS,  and  in  that  case  they  felt  like  the  interagency  re-
view process that was being levied on them was indeed adding time
to the process. And not only that, they felt like they could not move
forward  without  an  OMB  blessing  at  several  points  along  the  way
when they had adequately responded to concerns of the other agen-
cies and OMB.

So  in  that  sense,  this  science  agency  that,  as  you  mentioned,  is
set  up  in  statute  to  be  a  science  agency  was  kind  of,  in  our  view,
being obstructed by other agencies that don’t have that as their pri-
mary mission.

Chairman  MILLER.  And  in  their  own  view  based  on  what  they

said to you.

Mr. STEPHENSON. Yes. I mean, OMB will tell you that EPA owns
the IRIS process, but it depends upon which part of OMB you talk
to. The management agenda part of OMB says that EPA loses con-
trol of the process when they send a draft assessment to OMB, yet
the  OIRA  part  of  OMB  will  tell  you  that  EPA  still  owns  the  proc-
ess,  and  they  are  only  serving  to  coordinate  the  federal  family  of
comments.

Chairman MILLER. Have they stuck with that initial response to

the GAO’s facts?

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  They  asked  that  we  not  consider  the  exit  con-
ference  comments  of  the  program  office  officials  and  instead  con-
sider  the  official  agency  comments  which  no  longer  considered  the
interagency process as obstructive or taking additional time, rather
that  the  real  thing  that  took  time  was  the  complexity  of  IRIS  as-
sessments.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  So  OMB  told  them  that  they  were  in
fact  independent?  They  misapprehended  the  facts  when  they  said
that  they  were  not  independent,  OMB  advised  them  that  they
were, and now it is their view that they are?

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  They  are  the  decision-makers  according  to

OMB.

Chairman  MILLER.  My  time  is  almost  expired,  but  I  have  two
documents that have been provided to the Minority which I believe
are  the  initial  response  of  the  staff  of  IRIS,  and  then  the  official
response. And I now enter both of these into the record.

Chairman MILLER. My time is now expired. Mr. Reichert for five

minutes.

THE IRIS PROCESS

Mr.  REICHERT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you  for  being
here  with  us  this  morning,  sir.  I  have  a  question  about  balancing
priorities.  How  do  you  balance  the  competing  priorities  of  timeli-
ness and thoroughness?

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  In  science,  that  is  always  an  issue.  As  I  said
in my statement, the science is never going to be absolutely certain
on  a  given  chemical,  but  in  the  judgment  of  the  scientific  commu-
nity,  they  have  to  decide  when  protecting  human  health  should  be
undertaken.  You  have  to  get  into  a  cycle  of  risk  assessments  that
takes  about  two  to  four  years.  To  have  it  take  10  years,  you  will
never  finish  anything.  Chemicals  should  be  reassessed  after  10
years, so it is obvious that you won’t make any progress at two per
year. You need more like 50 a year.

Mr.  REICHERT.  But  to  follow  up  on  that,  until  this  new  process
was  released,  were  there  any  schedules  imposed  at  any  point  in
this process?

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  That  was  part  of  the  problem.  There  were  no
schedules  imposed.  So  now  there  is  a  schedule  imposed  on  that
complex  flow  chart  you  just  saw,  and  if  you  add  all  those  up,  the
minimum you can complete an assessment in is six years. In other
words, that is an unacceptable schedule.

Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Chairman, I will yield back.
Chairman MILLER. Thank you. Mr. Baird for five minutes.

DELAYED RISK ASSESSMENTS

Mr.  BAIRD.  Have  you  got  any  insights  into  what  the  costs  of  the
current  situation  is  in  terms  of  the  relatively  slow  pace  and  some
bias of information?

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  Well,  I  mean,  if  you  don’t  have  a  credible  risk
assessment, you can’t move from the risk assessment process to the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:30 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042370 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O08\052108\42370 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

43

risk  management  process.  The  risk  management  process  is  where
you  start  determining  what  regulatory  options  are  appropriate.  So
the  cost  and  lack  of  protection  to  human  health,  I  don’t  know  how
you  would  measure  that,  but  it  has  got  to  be  enormous  if  you  are
not  getting  these  risk  assessments  completed  in  time.  Now,  you
know, they can use other sources of science. They don’t have to use
IRIS,  and  they  have  in  some  cases  done  that.  Nevertheless,  IRIS
was put in place to streamline the scientific process so that we get
on with the business of determining which regulatory options were
appropriate for a given chemical.

Mr.  BAIRD.  You  know,  I  have  witnessed  a  pattern  in  the  past.  I
spent a fair bit of time doing research on the area of risk analysis,
and a rhetorical pattern which is, well, of course we need to protect
the  public,  but  we  must  make  that  protection  based  on  the  best
available  science.  And  if  the  corollary  is  that  you  make  interven-
tions  to  slow  down  or  obstruct  or  obfuscate  the  best  available
science,  you  then  allow  the  prior  argument  to  occur.  Is  there  any
of  that  going  on  where  people  are  saying,  well,  we  can’t  regulate
because we don’t have the information but then obstructing the ac-
cess to the information?

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  I  mean,  we  are  not  trying  to  say  that  there  is
intentional  obstruction  going  on.  We  didn’t  try  to  find  that.  But
that  is  why  we  do  believe  transparency  in  the  entire  process  is  so
critical.  It  removes  the  perception  of  a  conflict  of  interest.  We  en-
courage  DOD  and  DOE  and  any  agency  to  provide  comments  on
risk  assessments,  but  it  should  be  in  the  sunlight,  it  should  be
available to the scientific community for scrutiny, the same as any
other comments from any other organization is.

Mr.  BAIRD.  What  recourse  exists?  If  you  are  a  scientist  working
for an agency, and you have in your best scientific judgment made
a  case  in  a  certain  direction,  and  it  heads  to  another  entity  and
comes back in some way different than what you had put forward,
what options exist right now?

Mr. STEPHENSON. Well, I mean, that is why independence of EPA
is  so  important.  They  have  to  own  the  process.  You  have  to  hope
that  the  credibility  of  the  science  will  rule  and  that  they  will  con-
sider legitimate comments appropriately and address those kinds of
concerns appropriately. But to keep all that from public view is not
a good thing.

Mr.  BAIRD.  Yeah,  that  is  my  question.  So  do  we  believe  it  has
happened  that  someone  has  put  forward  a  report  that  went  to  a
different entity, let us say OMB, the scientific judgment in the ini-
tial report is in some way altered, influenced, undermined, blocked,
and  then  it  comes  back  and  is  disseminated  in  a  fashion  different
than the initial input?

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  I  don’t  know  that,  but  OMB,  DOD,  anybody
can  challenge  the  assumptions  within  the  assessment,  the  uncer-
tainty  analysis,  exposure  characteristics.  And  so  they  can  ask  for
additional  research  if  they  think  there  are  gaps  in  the  research
which  can  take  up  to  two  years.  There  is  a  certain  amount  of  ad
hocness  to  the  whole  process  that  is  secretive  right  now,  and  you
just  can’t  tell  what  is  going  on.  And  to  say  again  that  there  is
transparency  in  the  final  assessment  does  not  excuse  its  absence

44

early  in  the  process  when  you  need  to  see  what  is  going  on  with
these decisions.

Mr. BAIRD. Right. And let me ask this question. If someone were
to  ask  for—in  the  IRIS  process,  if  someone  says,  okay,  so  this  is
our best available science at the present moment regarding risk of
exposure at certain levels——

Mr. STEPHENSON. Right.
Mr. BAIRD.—we don’t ever expect to have the final answer on all
these chemicals. What IRIS I thought was to get the best available
evidence out there.

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  That  is  what  we  are  suggesting,  that  you
should take available research, do the best assessment you can, put
it into the database, and the intention is to revisit it at least every
10  years  or  when  new  science  becomes  available.  So  it  should  be
a  moving  database  that  is  the  repository  for  the  best  available
science on any chemical.

Mr. BAIRD. If that is the case then, requests for additional infor-
mation  that  are  delaying  should  not  necessarily  delay  publication
of  a  position,  they  should  be  included  as  a  corollary  opinion  or  a
statement, an explicit statement; but here is a question that is un-
resolved,  but  you  don’t  necessarily  delay  moving  forward  with  the
information, right?

Mr. STEPHENSON. But all of that rationale for moving forward or
considering  that  science  later  and  the  next  reassessment  of  that
chemical should be open to the science community for scrutiny.

Mr.  BAIRD.  Right.  Right.  I  think  that  is  right.  But  I  think  there
is  a  difference  between  saying  we  are  not  going  to  move  forward
with something——

Mr. STEPHENSON. Right.
Mr. BAIRD.—until we get the additional information versus move
forward  with  what  you  have  got  with  the  caveat  explicitly  stated
that  while  we  put  this  forward,  there  are  these  additional  ques-
tions.  What  you  are  saying  right  now  is  that  the  additional  ques-
tions can block moving forward.

Mr. STEPHENSON. Exactly. If you wait until the science is perfect,
you  will  never  regulate,  you  will  never  complete  a  toxicity  assess-
ment.  So  it  is  always  a  judgment  call,  and  it  is  only  the  first  step
to  deciding  whether  you  need  to  regulate  or  not.  It  doesn’t  mean
anything.  It  is  just  the  best  available  science  on  that  chemical  at
the time.

Mr. BAIRD. Thank you.
Chairman  MILLER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Baird.  Mr.  Rohrabacher  for

five minutes.

COMPARING RISK ASSESSMENTS: EPA VS. FDA

Mr. ROHRABACHER. I have been trying to put into perspective the
discussions  on  this  particular  issue  compared  to  some  of  the  other
issues that we face. You seem to be telling us we need to speed up
assessments  in  the  process.  Certainly  I  wouldn’t  disagree  with  the
concept  about  transparency  and  openness.  In  terms  of  speed,  now
let  me  note  that  in  other  areas  where  we  have  people  taking
the——

Chairman MILLER. Mr. Rohrabacher, it is very hard to hear you.

45

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Excuse  me.  I  will  get  a  little—have  to  lean
down  a  little  closer.  The  assessment  time  that,  for  example,  that
the  FDA  takes  in  approving  a  new  drug  or  approving  a  new  med-
ical process that could be sold on the market, would you think that
we should be speeding up those type of assessments?

Mr. STEPHENSON. Well, I think they should all be made efficient.
This  is  entirely  different.  This  is  toxic  chemicals.  They  are  not
things that you consume, not things that you eat.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, but——
Mr. STEPHENSON. And we——
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Actually it is something you consume.
Mr. STEPHENSON. Well, IRIS——
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Something  that  will  affect  people’s  health
and  it  will  affect  in  a  big  way  whether  or  not  certain  people  live
or die, and frankly with the FDA approval, we have the same situ-
ation.  There  are  people  who  wait  for  years  and  are  told,  oh,  boy,
the  FDA  has  approved  this  and  it  is  going  to  save  100,000  people
a year but it has taken them 10 years to get it on the market, and
it hasn’t changed a bit in 10 years. And so we have to assume that
100,000  people  a  year  have  been  negatively  affected  by  not  having
it  available  to  them.  So  why  is  there  a  dichotomy  then  between
speeding  up  the  assessment  now  but  not  wanting  to  speed  up  the
FDA assessments?

Mr. STEPHENSON. Let me just say that IRIS, you don’t start from
scratch  in  researching  the  chemical.  It  is  based  on  a  body  of  re-
search  that  is  already  available.  So  you  are  not  starting  from
ground  zero.  It  is  not  a  new  drug  that  has  been  introduced,  it  is
not  consumed.  You  may  be  exposed  to  it  in  a  variety  of  ways,  air-
borne ways. You are not ingesting it like a food product or a drug.
So  the  standards  are  completely  different.  Speeding  up  to  me
means you start with the available assignments right now and you
create a system where you can complete the synopsis of a summary
of  that  scientific  information  on  a  given  chemical  in  about  two
years.  Then  you  are  going  to  revisit  it  as  new  research  becomes
available.  But  if  you  never  finish  the  risk  assessment  in  the  first
place,  then  EPA  can’t  move  to  the  next  step  of  determining  what
is  appropriate  in  terms  of  regulating  or  not  a  given  chemical.  This
is the first step to regulating or deciding what you need to regulate
a  dangerous  chemical.  This  is  deciding  how  dangerous  it  is.  It  is
based on existing research, not new research necessarily.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, I think in both situations you have peo-
ple’s  lives  at  stake  or  at  least  their  health  at  stake.  And  it  seems
to  me  that  there  is  a  sort  of  predetermined  reaction  with  certain
people  that  some  are  trying  to  basically  protect  the  public  to  the
point that the public is sometimes damaged by that and sometimes
it  is  not.  Sometimes  you  can  be  overly  protected  and  find  that  the
person who is trying to actually end up helping you is doing some-
thing that prevents you from improving your situation.

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  In  your  example,  you  are  denying  a  drug  that
may  save  lives  in  the  future.  In  my  example,  you  are  not  moving
forward  with  regulations  on  a  chemical  that  may  protect  human
health until you wait for the science to be perfect. It is a judgment
call in both cases. You are absolutely right. But we are suggesting
that  if  you  wait  until  the  science  is  perfect,  then  there  is  many

more  years  of  a  potentially  dangerous  chemical  that  could  affect
public health.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  As  could  public  health  be  affected  by  people
who  take  too  long  in  assessing  something  that  could  have  a  dra-
matic impact on cancer or some other malady.

Thank you very much. I appreciate your testimony.

RISK ASSESSMENT VS. RISK MANAGEMENT

Chairman MILLER. Thank you. Mr. Stephenson, if I could get Mr.

Whittaker again to put up the streamlined process, Figure 3.

While it is coming up, Mr. Stephenson, quickly, explain again in
a  sentence  or  two  the  difference  between  risk  assessment  and  risk
management.

Mr. STEPHENSON. Risk assessment is when you are really synthe-
sizing the best available research on a given chemical to determine
the toxicity of that chemical.

Chairman MILLER. What danger does this chemical pose.
Mr. STEPHENSON. What danger does it potentially pose.
Chairman MILLER. What is risk management?
Mr. STEPHENSON. Risk management is when you take that infor-
mation  and  you  decide  how  serious  it  is,  how  many  people  are  af-
fected,  what  regulatory  options  might  be  available,  what  would  be
the  cost  benefit  of  instituting  those  regulations,  and  it  is  a  whole
separate  process  that  starts  after  the  risk  assessment  is  complete.
Chairman  MILLER.  Mr.  Rohrabacher  talked  about  some  people—
I  thought  he  was  probably  calling  my  name—who  thought  we
should be doing, you know, a good deal more to protect people from
risk. Is that not risk management rather than risk assessment?

Mr. STEPHENSON. It is.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. So this is simply trying to decide what
danger to the public health and to the environment a chemical may
pose.

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  And  until  you  know  that  you  don’t  know

what——

Chairman MILLER. You don’t know what to do about it.
Mr. STEPHENSON. Right.
Chairman MILLER. Or whether you need to do anything about it.
Mr. STEPHENSON. That is right.

47

Chairman  MILLER.  Or  how  to  proceed  with  any  kind  of  risk  or
cost  benefit  analysis,  is  that  correct?  Okay.  Now,  you  talked  about
transparency.  Again,  looking  at  Figure  3,  and  I  assume  that  you
have  got  it  before  you  which  may  be  easier  on  your  neck  to  look
down, but could you kind of walk through the various steps where
there is no public participation, there is no transparency?

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  I  don’t  have  it  in  front  of  me  unfortunately

but——

Chairman MILLER. Can you turn so you can see it?
Mr. STEPHENSON. Where there is no public participation is when
EPA is starting its draft assessment process and other agencies can
comment on the approach and on what things should be considered
on,  if  they  have  research  they  can  bring  it  forward.  With  glasses
on I can’t see that.

Chairman  MILLER.  This  is  the  Science  Committee,  and  the
Science  and  Technology  Committee  doesn’t  mean  that  we  are  all
adept at technology.

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  Well,  I  think  it  is  probably,  it  is  hard  to  tell.
I  mean,  this  is  a  very  confusing  process,  but  in  general,  it  is  the
part  where  they  look  at  the  draft  assessment,  determine  if  addi-
tional  research  is  needed,  what  default  assumptions  might  be  ap-
propriate, what toxicity assessments might be appropriate.

Chairman MILLER. And the agencies that are using the chemical

presumably would have a chance to comment at that point?

Mr. STEPHENSON. Exactly. Like I say, I disagree with this in your
risk  assessment.  You  may  need  to  do  this  additional  research  or
you need to consider that.

48

Chairman  MILLER.  We  are  using  again  the  example  of  TCE.  Is
it  your  impression  that  the  DOD’s  toxicologist  would  be  partici-
pating or someone else or do you know?

Mr. STEPHENSON. I don’t know.
Chairman  MILLER.  Just  someone  at  Department  of  Defense
would  presumably  be  participating.  How  about  TCE  manufactur-
ers?

Mr. STEPHENSON. I don’t know.
Chairman MILLER. You don’t know if they would be given an op-
portunity  to  comment  privately  or  publicly?  Well,  we  know  they
could comment publicly.

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  TCE  is  a  degreaser  that  is  widely  used  in
motor pools and in gas stations across the country. It is used every-
where.

Chairman  MILLER.  If  the  Department  of  Defense’s  point  is,  we
really  need  to  use  this  or  our  stuff  isn’t  going  to  work  right,  that
is really more risk management than risk assessment?

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  It  is.  If  they  have  concerns  about  the  cost  of
cleaning  up  TCE  based  on  a  given  standard,  that  is  all  risk  man-
agement decisions.

Chairman  MILLER.  And  if  they  are  saying  this  TCE  is  just  not
going  to  hurt  you,  it  doesn’t  pose  any  kind  of  environmental  risk,
it doesn’t pose any kind of health risk, that is risk assessment.

Mr. STEPHENSON. Exactly.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  And  wouldn’t  you  expect  scientists  to

be involved in risk assessment?

Mr. STEPHENSON. That is our assertion.
Chairman  MILLER.  Is  there  any  reason  that  if  their  toxicologists
are  participating  in  this  it  wouldn’t  be  an  open,  transparent  proc-
ess,  it  wouldn’t  be  peer  reviewed,  it  wouldn’t  be  an  open,  trans-
parent  discussion,  argument,  disputation,  asserting  facts  in  public
for  them  to  be  questioned  by  other  scientists,  other  peers,  expert
in the field? Is there any reason that kind of debate should be pri-
vate?

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  We  can’t  imagine  a  scientific  concern  that

shouldn’t be made public.

Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  And  what  expertise  in  science  does

OMB have?

edge?

Mr. STEPHENSON. I don’t know.
Chairman  MILLER.  Is  that  part  of  their  mission  to  your  knowl-

Mr. STEPHENSON. There is no ‘‘s’’ in OMB so I don’t know.

ment,  it  is  all  management  and  budget.  Okay.  Mr.  Baird,  four  or

earlier. Can you talk a little bit about what it would take to change
the current situation. Is this something we need to deal with statu-

49

torily or do we need to just say to those who would meddle inappro-
priately, knock it off or what do we do?

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  Again,  we  had  eight  specific  recommendations
that EPA said it would consider in our report, and it did not. Other
than  loosely  assigning  some  timeframes  to  this  cumbersome  proc-
ess,  I  can’t  imagine  what  recommendations  they  did  consider.  So
that  is  why  we  suggest  in  our  testimony—you  have  got  to  remem-
ber  that  the  report  was  written  before  this  new  process  was  un-
veiled on April the 10th. Our report was in March. And so we were
frankly  very  surprised  when  this  process  came  out,  and  we  men-
tioned there may be a need for legislation. Certainly we would rec-
ommend stopping this process, but there may be—if EPA is unable
to  make  the  changes  we  suggest  in  our  report,  then  legislative  ac-
tion may be needed to establish timeframes and establish a process
for them. That is not the desired approach, but I am not sure what
else can be done.

Mr. BAIRD. And you don’t seem to have seen much evidence that

they are going to follow these recommendations?

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  To  the  contrary.  I  think  this  process  is  worse
than  the  draft  we  reviewed  because  of  the  transparency  issue,  be-
cause  of  the  many  bites  at  the  apple  that  agencies  with  a  conflict
of interest like DOD have that is now secretive and not public. And
all  this  is  new  from  the  draft  proposal.  But  we  are  encouraging
agencies  to  participate  in  the  process  early,  it  just  should  be  done
in  the  sunlight  and  with  better  planning  and  advanced  notice  of
when you are going to do assessment. There is no reason why this
process can’t be shortened and still be very, very credible.

Mr.  BAIRD.  Have  any  cogent  arguments  been  made  or  what  are
the  arguments  that  are  made  for  keeping  the  shades  drawn  and
not letting the sunlight in?

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  The  only  thing  that  came  up  was  the  quality
of  the  assessments.  If  you  take  10  years,  the  quality  doesn’t  make
much  difference  because  it  is  obsolete  the  day  it  is  finished.  So
there have been no good arguments that I can see why this process
can’t  be  streamlined  and  improved,  and  it  is  so,  so  critical  to  the
protection of human health that we just have to get it fixed.

Mr. BAIRD. In science there are some occasions where things are
confidential,  identity  of  peer  reviewers  and  peer  review.  I  think  it
is  actually  an  error  to  do  that  myself.  But  certainly  the  data  are
supposed to be made available.

Mr. STEPHENSON. The data, the assumptions, the process——
Mr. BAIRD. Methodology.
Mr.  STEPHENSON.—the  methodology.  Everything  should  be  to-
tally  open.  How  are  you  going  to  assure  that  the  best  science  is
considered and is in there if it is not an open process?

Mr.  BAIRD.  This  is  admittedly  a  little  bit  extreme  but  under  the
current  situation,  risk  analysis,  risk  assessment  could  be  sent  up.
Somebody with OMB or some other agency could say, yes, but you
haven’t studied this impact in the strain of Norwegian rats R24A6.
You haven’t done this with R24A2, and we won’t let you go forward
until  you  do  R24A6  and  just  sort  of  throw  that  out  there,  whether
or not it is relevant but nevertheless results in a significant delay.
Is that——

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  It  could  happen.  I  mean,  we  have  no  evidence
of that, but if it is not open to scrutiny by the scientific community,
things  like  that  could  happen.  It  could  be  continually  be  assessed.
If it is continually assessed, it is never regulated.

Mr. BAIRD. But if it were made available, then people would have
transparency  and  say  possibly,  thank  goodness  for  this  agency
doing their job. It turns out that the assessment had not looked at
something important, and then the people who asked that more be
looked  at  were  doing  a  good  job  and  a  good  public  service.  Or  con-
versely,  the  publicity  or  the  transparency  could  lead  some  to  say
they  are  asking  tangential,  ridiculous,  and  unjustified  questions
which are not scientifically defensible. It could go either way, right?

Mr. STEPHENSON. Exactly. Very well said.
Mr. BAIRD. Thank you. I would yield back.
Chairman MILLER. Mr. Rohrabacher for five minutes.

MORE ON RISK ASSESSMENT VS. RISK MANAGEMENT

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Yes, I am not sure if I agree with the Chair-
man on his emphasis of differentiating risk management from risk
assessment.  Obviously,  we  live  in  a  real  world.  What  we  have  to
do is make sure the activities that are being conducted relate to ex-
actly what the impacts will be and not just state theoretical stand-
ard  not  associated  with  the  way  things  happen  in  our  lives.  Is  it
possible  for  the  OMB  to  come  in  earlier?  Scientists,  I  have  a  great
deal  of  respect  for  scientists,  but  I  also  know  that  sometimes  sci-
entists  become  too  focused  and  do  not  fully  appreciate  the  mag-
nitude of what they are doing to other people and other things out-
side  of  the  laboratory.  And  sometimes  perhaps—and  I  am  a  jour-
nalist  by  profession,  by  the  way.  So  I  realize  that  I  do  not  know
this  much  about  anything  but  I  do  know  this  much  about  that
much. And sometimes it helps science authorities to have their per-
spective  come  in  and  talk  to  them  about  putting  their  science  in
perspective,  rather  than  having  it  be  a  purely  scientific  laboratory
endeavor, does it not?

Mr. STEPHENSON. Well, yes, but I mean the toxicity of a chemical
is the toxicity of a chemical. It is not subject to the implications of
whatever  that  assessment  shows.  That  is  risk  management.  That
is when you decide whether it needs to be regulated or not.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. But there are certain——
Mr. STEPHENSON. Is it a big risk?
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Yeah,  but  there  are  certain  areas  that—for
example, if a certain chemical is needed to complete a mission that
is important for the security or safety or even health of the public,
that  should  be  taken  into  consideration  in  terms  of  the  risks  that
people take in order to achieve that other goal.

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  Under  either  risk  management  phase.  That  is
when  cost  becomes  an  option.  Toxicity  should  have  no  bearing  on
the cost of that toxicity assessment.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. But the importance of that should not be part

of a determinant factor by those scientists at all?

Mr. STEPHENSON. I mean, we are not suggesting that——
Mr. ROHRABACHER. That should——
Mr. STEPHENSON. We are not suggesting that the EPA scientists
go  into  a  vacuum  in  a  closed  room  and  do  their  analysis.  We  are

suggesting  that  everybody  should  have  an  opportunity  to  comment
on  that.  We  just  think  that  all  the  comments  should  be  treated
openly, that the whole science community——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. There is no question about whatever commu-
nication happens, and I would certainly look into that, within gov-
ernment, people should be held accountable and it should be trans-
parent. I mean I certainly am not suggesting that. I am suggesting
that maybe what you are suggesting is that it be a lack of commu-
nication.

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  No.  No.  The  cost  of  cleaning  up  a  given  chem-
ical—let  us  use  TCE  again.  Let  us  say  that  it  is  determined  and
it has been by the National Academy and EPA and everybody else
who  has  looked  at  it  to  be  a  very  toxic  chemical  that  likely  causes
cancer.  Now  we  should  move  to  the  risk  management  phase  and
decide—that  is  when  we  decide,  okay,  DOD  uses  a  lot  of  this  stuff
and  if  we  set  the  cleanup  standard  at  this  level,  it  is  going  to  cost
them  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  to  clean  it  up.  That  is  a  risk
management  decision.  Those  factors,  those  cost  benefit  analysis  of
the regulation——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Or let me put——
Mr.  STEPHENSON.—are  appropriate  but  not  in  the  scientific

phase.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Let  me  put  it  in  a  different  way.  You  have
got  a  chemical  that  is  an  important  part  of  a  process  that  is  used
to  save  lives  rather  than  just  put  things  at  risk.  Maybe  there  is  a
chemical that is needed in the process of a certain kind of food that
is  necessary  to  prevent  starvation  or  to  take  care  of  certain  types
of  diseases  in  Africa  or  such.  Yeah,  we  need  to  know  that  that  is
important——

Mr. STEPHENSON. I agree.
Mr. ROHRABACHER.—that if there is going to be no way to control

the mosquitoes in Africa if this decision goes the wrong way.

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  I  agree,  and  those  decisions  are  made  all  the
time.  When  you  consider  how  expensive  it  would  be  for  the  regu-
lated  community  to  impose  a  regulation,  all  those  are  fair  game
and appropriate discussions, but they are part of the risk manage-
ment  phase,  not  the  scientifically  based  risk  assessment  phase  of
a chemical.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. I am thinking that what we are talking about
is—again, you are much more an expert. That is why you are testi-
fying  and  I  am  listening.  But  it  just  seems  to  me  that  we  have—
the process isn’t as defined as all of these boxes that we have seen
and  that  people  realize  that  within  a  period  of  time  perhaps  more
science  examination  can  come  into  the  process  rather  than  in  the
first box it could also come in the last box unless we have a totally
closed system. Does that make sense?

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  Yeah,  and  we  are  not  suggesting  a  closed  sys-
tem.  We  are  suggesting  that  it  is  appropriate  for  all  commenters
to comment on a scientific risk assessment.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  I  am  certainly  not  in  favor  of  anything  that

would hinder transparency or making people accountable.

Mr. STEPHENSON. Nor are we.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much.

Chairman MILLER. That was the last round of questions. I would,
just  to  summarize,  if  I  understand  correctly  your  testimony  in  re-
sponse  to  Mr.  Rohrabacher’s  question,  you  see  no  virtue  in  con-
sciously not knowing and not consciously not learning the potential
risk to public health or to the environment of a chemical?

Mr. STEPHENSON. None whatsoever.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Thank  you  very  much.  If  we  will  now
have  a  short  break,  and  the  next  set  of  witnesses,  the  next  panel.

[Recess.]
Chairman MILLER. Welcome back. We do have a couple of house-
keeping  matters  that  I  neglected  earlier.  One  is  I  now  ask  unani-
mous  consent  that  all  Members  have  two  weeks  to  enter  state-
ments for the record. Without objection.

I  also  ask  unanimous  consent  to  enter  materials  in  the  record.
All  the  materials  have  been  shared  with  the  Minority  already.
Again, without objection.

Panel II:

I would now like introduce our second panel. Dr. George Gray is
the  Assistant  Administrator  for  Research  and  Development  of  the
United States Environmental Protection Agency. Ms. Susan Dudley
is  the  Administrator  for  the  Office  of  Information  and  Regulatory
Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget, OIRA. As our wit-
nesses  should  know,  taking  testimony  is  limited  to  five  minutes
after  which  the  Members  of  the  Committee  will  have  five  minutes
to  ask  questions  in  at  least  one  round  and  perhaps  a  series  of
rounds.  It  is  the  practice  of  the  Subcommittee  to  take  testimony
under oath. Do either of you have any objections to being sworn in?
The Committee also provides that you may be represented by coun-
sel.  Are  either  of  you  represented  by  counsel  today?  You  are  not?
Okay. If you would please stand and raise your right hand? Do you
swear  to  tell  the  truth  and  nothing  but  the  truth?  Let  the  record
reflect that both the witnesses answered yes that they do so swear.
At  this  point,  we  will  now  open  our  first—I  am  sorry.  Dr.  Gray,

you may begin.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  GEORGE  M.  GRAY,  ASSISTANT  ADMINIS-
TRATOR FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, U.S. ENVIRON-
MENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
Dr.  GRAY.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Miller,  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  this  sub-
committee  to  discuss  EPA’s  highly  regarded  IRIS,  Integrated  Risk
Information System. As you know, IRIS is a repository of informa-
tion  on  potential  adverse  effects  of  long-term  exposure  to  over  540
potential environmental contaminants.

The  IRIS  program  began  in  the  mid-1980s.  At  that  time,  it  was
clear  that  the  toxicity  values  that  were  being  used  and  developed
by  EPA  were  not  internally  consistent  across  the  Agency,  even
when  based  on  the  same  data.  That  was  due  to  different  assump-
tions,  different  science,  different  choices  of  defaults.  IRIS  was
therefore formed as an internal database in response to the critical
need to have Agency-wide toxicity values in one place.

53

Word  quickly  spread  about  the  existence  of  IRIS,  and  State  and
local, public health and environmental agencies as well as the reg-
ulated community asked us to make it publicly available. So in the
late  1980’s  IRIS  was  made  available  to  the  public.  I  have  actually
been interested in and using IRIS for many years as part of my re-
search  and  my  teaching  at  the  Harvard  School  of  Public  Health.  I
have had a very longstanding interest in IRIS.

Now the IRIS website gets more than 20,000 hits a day with in-
quiries coming from over 100 countries. The IRIS assessments con-
tain  only  part  of  the  information  that  is  needed  to  characterize
public  health  risks  of  chemical  substances  in  support  of  risk  man-
agement decisions.

It  is  important  to  understand  not  only  how  risk  assessment  dif-
fers  from  risk  management  but  also  to  recognize  that  risk  assess-
ments,  including  our  IRIS  assessments,  include  both  science  and
science policy components. This is often a source of confusion.

Now  like  all  living  processes,  the  IRIS  process  has  evolved  over
time. For example, efforts have been made to enhance our peer re-
view  process  and  to  address  the  longstanding  issue  of  the  timeli-
ness  of  our  IRIS  reviews.  Because  it  began  as  an  internal  EPA  re-
source, the agenda for developing IRIS assessments first focused on
those  chemical  assessments  that  were  needed  for  EPA.  But  now
each  year  EPA  develops  an  annual  agenda  for  the  IRIS  program
and  announces  the  new  assessments  under  review  in  the  Federal
Register. In recent years the IRIS program has also sought nomina-
tions for IRIS chemical reviews from the public and from other fed-
eral agencies.

Some of these recent changes in the IRIS process include: devel-
opment  of  our  IRIS  track  web  system  so  people  can  see  the  status
of  a  chemical;  new  opportunities  for  the  public  and  other  agencies
to  review  and  comment  on  IRIS  assessments;  and  enhanced  inde-
pendent external peer review of our draft IRIS assessments.

In  2005,  a  formal  process  for  documenting  all  the  existing  steps
in  the  IRIS  process,  including  formalizing  some  of  these  and  some
new  recent  changes  to  the  process,  was  initiated.  And  on  April  10,
2008, this revised IRIS process was announced by EPA.

The  release  of  this  is  noteworthy  because  this  is  the  first  time
that  the  IRIS  process  has  been  transparently  documented  and
made  available  to  the  public.  The  new  IRIS  process  has  been  de-
signed  to  provide  greater  transparency,  objectivity,  balance,  rigor,
and  predictability  in  our  IRIS  assessments.  For  example,  improve-
ments  in  the  IRIS  process  helped  define  critical  and  appropriate
roles for public and interagency comments and for interactions that
promote  greater  communication,  sharing  information,  between  all
interested  parties  in  EPA.  Yearly  involvement  of  various  stake-
holders  is  consistent  with  recommendations  we  received  from  our
own  science  advisory  board  and  from  the  GAO.  Remember  that
along  with  the  increased  opportunities  for  public  and  other  agency
involvement, all draft IRIS toxicological reviews will ultimately un-
dergo  independent  external  peer  review,  and  all  final  decisions  on
IRIS content remain with EPA.

It is worth noting that the revised IRIS process also meets many
of  the  recommendations  of  the  recently-issued  2008  GAO  report.
Specifically,  we  believe  that  the  new  process  clearly  defines  and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:30 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042370 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O08\052108\42370 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

54

documents  a  streamlined  IRIS  process,  it  defines  the  critical  and
appropriate  roles  for  the  public  and  other  agencies,  and  impor-
tantly,  it  sets  time  limits  for  all  parties  including  EPA.  So  though
the  revised  process  is  expected  to  improve  the  timeliness  of  IRIS
assessments,  it  is  important  to  recognize  that  many  assessments
today are more complex than ever, and some assessments will take
longer than others to complete.

For  example,  recent  NAS  and  Science  Advisory  Board  reviewers
have  recommended  EPA  do  a  better  job  of  incorporating  quan-
titative uncertainty analysis in IRIS assessments.

Right now, EPA needs time to implement and evaluate this new
process,  recognizing  that  additional  changes  to  the  process  may  be
needed  in  the  future  because  it  really  is  intended  to  be  a  living
database and a living process.

So  thank  you,  Chairman  Miller  and  Members  of  the  Sub-
committee  for  the  opportunity  to  describe  the  scope,  the  purpose,
and the future of EPA’s IRIS program. I look forward to answering
any questions you may have.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Gray follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF GEORGE M. GRAY

Good morning, Chairman Miller and Members of the Committee. My name is Dr.
George  Gray,  and  I  am  the  Assistant  Administrator  for  Research  and  Development
(ORD) at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). I also serve as the Agen-
cy’s  Science  Advisor.  Thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  appear  before  the  Sub-
committee  to  discuss  EPA’s  highly  regarded  Integrated  Risk  Information  System
(IRIS),  which  is  managed  by  EPA’s  National  Center  for  Environmental  Assessment
(NCEA) within ORD.

As  you  may  know,  IRIS  is  a  repository  of  human  health  risk  information  on  the
potential adverse effects of long-term, or chronic, exposure to over 540 potential en-
vironmental  contaminants.  The  risk  information  in  IRIS  can  include  quantitative
risk estimates for both non-cancer and cancer effects, as well as a detailed narrative
that accompanies the risk estimates. The narratives, or qualitative risk information,
include a full discussion of the peer reviewed scientific literature used in the assess-
ment,  the  EPA  confidence  in  the  IRIS  risk  estimates,  and  an  explanation  of  the
judgments (including application of default approaches and uncertainty factors) that
the Agency must make in the face of inadequate data.

A significant part of EPA’s efforts to fulfill its mission to protect public health and
the environment is to regulate, when necessary, the release of contaminants into the
Nation’s  air,  water,  and  soil.  As  first  outlined  by  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences
(NAS)  in  its  seminal  1983  report  (‘‘Risk  Assessment  in  the  Federal  Government:
Managing  the  Process,’’  National  Academies  Press,  ISBN:0309033497,  commonly
called the ‘‘Red Book’’), there are two distinct steps that should be used in the Fed-
eral Government to assess and manage risks. These steps are called risk assessment
and risk management. Risk assessment, as defined by the NAS, is ‘‘the characteriza-
tion  of  the  potential  adverse  health  effects  of  human  exposures  to  environmental
hazards’’  (p.  18).  Risk  assessments  can  entail  either  quantitative  or  qualitative  ex-
pressions  of  risk,  and  should  include  characterization  of  the  uncertainties  inherent
in  the  process  of  inferring  risk.  The  risk  assessment  process  has  four  components:
hazard identification, dose-response evaluation, exposure assessment, and risk char-
acterization.  Risk  management  is  defined  by  the  NAS  as  ‘‘the  process  of  evaluating
alternative regulatory options and selecting among them’’ (p. 18). A risk assessment
may serve as one of the bases of risk management.

IRIS  assessments  fall  into  the  first  step  (risk  assessment);  however  they  only  in-
clude  information  on  hazard  identification  and  dose-response  evaluation.  Combined
with exposure information, government and private entities use IRIS to help charac-
terize the public health risks of chemical substances and thereby support risk man-
agement  decisions.  Thus,  it  is  important  to  note  that  an  IRIS  health  assessment  is
not  a  complete  risk  assessment.  It  provides  part  of  the  foundation  for  EPA’s  deci-
sion-making and regulatory processes. In addition, risk managers consider other im-
portant  factors  in  a  risk  management  decision  such  as  exposures,  statutory  and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:30 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042370 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\I&O08\052108\42370 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

55

legal  considerations,  social  considerations,  public  health  considerations,  economic
factors, and political considerations.

It  is  important  to  recognize  that  although  risk  assessment  is  distinct  from  risk
management, the risk assessment process consists of both ‘‘science’’ and ‘‘science pol-
icy’’  components.  That  is,  although  there  are  some  instances  at  EPA  where  ‘‘pure
science’’  is  involved  (e.g.,  conducting  bench  or  lab  research  on  animals  in  toxicity
studies), much of the work done at EPA (including IRIS assessments) involves both
science and science policy. For example, due to the uncertainty in IRIS assessments,
judgments and choices must be made about the most appropriate assumptions, data
sets,  health  endpoints,  models,  etc.  to  use  in  deriving  toxicity  values.  These  are
science policy choices because the science is not precise enough to provide definitive
answers.  For  this  reason,  guidance  documents  such  as  EPA’s  ‘‘Guidelines  for  Car-
cinogen  Risk  Assessment’’  were  developed  and  approved  through  the  Agency’s
Science  Policy  Council  to  inform  the  many  choices  in  the  risk  assessment  process.
This  is  an  important  distinction  that  is  often  overlooked  or  confused  by  the  public,
yet  the  NAS  Red  Book  (1983)  recognized  and  commented  on  this  issue  in  the  very
first  chapter  and  its  section  on  ‘‘Scientific  and  Policy  Judgments  in  Risk  Assess-
ment’’ (p. 28).

The IRIS program began in the mid-1980s. At that time, it was clear that the tox-
icity values that were being developed by EPA were not internally consistent across
the Agency. For example, EPA’s Program Offices were publishing toxicity values for
a particular chemical in their rule-makings and in other policy documents that were
based on the same set of available scientific data—but these values could be orders
of  magnitude  different  and  based  on  different  human  health  endpoints  or  default
uncertainty  factors.  This  example  illustrates  how  important  it  is  to  acknowledge
where  the  science  stops  and  science  policy  begins,  as  credible  scientists  can  (and
often  do)  reach  different  conclusions  based  on  their  interpretation  of  the  science  or
make different choices when confronted with several scientifically plausible options.
IRIS  was  therefore  formed  in  response  to  a  critical  need  to  have  Agency-wide  tox-
icity  values  in  one  place—including  accompanying  narratives  detailing  the  sup-
porting studies, key assumptions and choices, and text on confidence—that were de-
veloped through reviews by Agency health scientists.

IRIS was originally intended to be an internal system that provided EPA risk as-
sessors  and  managers  with  an  EPA  consensus  position  on  the  potential  human
health hazard and dose-response information for environmental contaminants of in-
terest  to  Agency  programs  and  regions.  Word  spread  quickly  about  the  existence  of
IRIS and many asked to make it a publicly available system. State and local public
health  and  environmental  agencies,  as  well  as  the  regulated  community,  requested
access to the IRIS information. Therefore, in the late 1980’s, IRIS access was made
available  to  the  public.  EPA  was  pleased  to  share  this  information  resource  with  a
large, external user community. IRIS first became available on a dial-up service and
later through the National Library of Medicine’s TOXNET family of information re-
sources,  and  then  on  the  Internet.  The  IRIS  web  site  is  accessed  over  20,000  times
per day with inquiries coming from well over 100 other countries.

The IRIS process has evolved over time including in areas such as setting the an-
nual  IRIS  agenda,  level  of  independent  external  peer  review,  and  opportunities  for
public  and  other  federal  agency  review  and  comments.  Because  IRIS  began  as  an
internal EPA resource, the agenda for developing IRIS assessments focused on those
chemical  assessments  of  interest  to  EPA’s  program  offices  and  regions.  It  was  an
informal process where only Agency needs were addressed. Now each year, EPA de-
velops  an  annual  agenda  for  the  IRIS  program  and  announces  new  assessments
under  review  in  the  Federal  Register.  EPA  uses  five  general  criteria  to  determine
which new chemicals to assess: (1) potential public health impact; (2) EPA statutory,
regulatory,  or  program/regional-specific  implementation  needs;  (3)  availability  of
new  scientific  information  or  methodology  that  might  significantly  change  the  cur-
rent IRIS information; (4) interest to other governmental agencies or the public; and
(5)  availability  of  other  scientific  assessment  documents  that  could  serve  as  a  basis
for an IRIS assessment.

In recent years, the IRIS Program has also sought nominations for IRIS chemical
reviews  from  the  public  and  other  federal  agencies.  The  list  of  new  or  updated  as-
sessments  chosen  for  potential  development  is  published  in  the  Federal  Register
(FR) as part of the IRIS annual agenda. The Agency is also working to improve the
prioritization  process  to  more  appropriately  capture  relative  priorities  of  individual
chemical assessments under development. For each of the assessments added to the
IRIS  agenda,  an  initial  literature  search  is  conducted.  As  literature  searches  are
completed,  the  results  are  posted  on  the  IRIS  web  site  (www.epa.gov/iris)  and  the
public  and  other  agencies  are  invited  to  review  the  literature  search  results  and
submit additional information to EPA. Other recent changes to the IRIS process in-

clude  creation  of  a  chemical  assessment  tracking  system  (IRISTrack)  on  the  IRIS
web site to inform the public and stakeholders of the status of the IRIS assessments
that  are  underway,  new  opportunities  for  the  public  and  other  agencies  to  review
and  comment  on  the  qualitative  and  draft  IRIS  assessments  (including  the  ability
to  participate  in  ‘‘listening  sessions’’  held  during  the  public  comment  period),  and
enhanced  independent  external  peer  reviews  of  draft  IRIS  assessments.  The  IRIS
program has also experienced an expansion of scientific staff and a significantly in-
creased budget over the last few years. For example, based on the enacted FY 2003
resources,  EPA  has  since  nearly  tripled  the  number  of  IRIS  staff  and  have  quad-
rupled the IRIS budget through the FY 2009 request to 37.0 FTE and $9.4 million,
respectively.

In  2005,  a  formal  process  for  documenting  all  of  the  existing  steps  in  the  IRIS
process,  including  formalizing  recent  changes  to  the  process,  was  initiated,  and  on
April 10, 2008, the revised IRIS process was announced by EPA. The public release
of  the  revised  IRIS  process  is  especially  noteworthy  because  the  IRIS  process  has
never before been transparently documented and made available to the public. Con-
sequently, the IRIS process had often been viewed as a ‘‘black box’’ both within and
outside of the Agency, as it was unclear what steps comprised the process, what the
timing  was  for  each  step,  or  where  opportunities  existed  for  internal  and  external
Agency  involvement.  The  new  IRIS  process  has  been  designed  to  provide  greater
transparency, objectivity, balance, rigor and predictability in IRIS assessments. Spe-
cifically, improvements to the IRIS process help define critical and appropriate roles
for public and interagency comments and interactions, and promote greater commu-
nication  and  sharing  of  information  between  all  interested  parties  and  EPA.  The
outcome of these improvements are expected to result in a more predictable, stream-
lined,  and  transparent  process  for  conducting  IRIS  assessments,  which  will  ulti-
mately lead to assessments that are of the highest quality and rigor.

Delays in the completion of IRIS assessments have been a long-standing problem
at  EPA.  For  example,  prior  IRIS  assessments  took  an  average  of  five  years  to  com-
plete,  and  EPA  has  been  working  on  some  assessments  for  a  decade  or  longer.  The
revised  process  was  designed  to  help  address  these  delays,  in  part,  by  allowing  for
input from various stakeholders (e.g., EPA program and regional offices, other agen-
cies,  scientific  organizations,  NGOs,  and  the  public)  early  in  the  process  and  pro-
viding  clear  descriptions  and  timeframes  for  each  step.  The  early  involvement  of
various  stakeholders  is  consistent  with  recommendations  from  EPA’s  Science  Advi-
sory Board (SAB) as well as a prior report by the General Accounting Office (GAO).
For  example,  in  a  September  26,  2000,  letter  from  EPA’s  SAB  to  Administrator
Carol  Browner,  it  was  noted  that  ‘‘critical  data’’  were  often  missing  from  IRIS  risk
assessment  discussions  and  it  was  suggested  that  one  way  to  enhance  the  quality
of toxicologic evaluations was to ‘‘make the IRIS process open to public stakeholder
review  in  a  more  formal  manner.’’  A  2006  report  by  GAO  (GAO–06–595)  entitled
‘‘Human  Health  Risk  Assessment:  EPA  Has  Taken  Steps  to  Strengthen  Its  Process
but Improvements Needed in Planning, Data Development, and Training’’ also noted
that  ‘‘. . .  several  experts  said  that  increased  involvement  with  a  broad  range  of
stakeholders  early  in  the  planning  process  would  help  identify  alternative  methods
and  models  and  obtain  stakeholder  concurrence  with  the  agency’s  approach.’’  The
new  process  therefore  allows  the  EPA  access  to  a  wide  range  of  scientific  data,  ex-
pertise,  and  knowledge  that  can  be  used  to  produce  timely  and  high  quality  IRIS
assessments.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  all  draft  IRIS  assessments  are  peer
reviewed  by  outside  experts,  and  all  final  decisions  on  IRIS  content  remain  with
EPA.

It is important to recognize that many of the assessments today are more complex
than  ever  before.  For  example,  some  chemicals  have  extensive  toxicity  testing  data
that  must  be  reviewed  and  analyzed,  new  data  are  now  available  for  assessing  the
mode  of  action  of  many  chemicals,  and  more  sophisticated  statistical  and  modeling
techniques  (e.g.,  physiologically-based  pharmacokinetic  or  PBPK  models)  are  now
available  for  evaluating  intra-species  and  inter-species  differences.  Recent  peer  re-
views of IRIS assessments by the NAS and EPA’s SAB have also recommended that
EPA do a better job of incorporating quantitative uncertainty analyses into IRIS as-
sessments.  The  timelines  in  the  new  IRIS  process  balance  the  need  for  careful  con-
sideration  of  science  and  science  policy  in  assessments  with  the  Agency’s  need  for
information.

An  important  aspect  of  the  revised  process  includes  ‘‘mission  critical’’  chemicals
that will be determined by a sponsoring agency together with EPA. A ‘‘mission crit-
ical’’  chemical  is  one  that  is  an  integral  component  to  the  successful  and  safe  con-
duct  of  an  agency’s  mission  in  any  or  all  phases  of  its  operations.  Impacts  on  use
of  mission  critical  chemicals  include  cessation  or  degradation  of  the  conduct  of  the
mission  and/or  unacceptable  resource  constraints.  Agencies  must  identify  to  ORD

those chemicals on the IRIS Program Annual Agenda that they determine meet this
definition,  and  generate  a  detailed  report  documenting  what  types  of  new  research
will address significant data gaps and whether such research can be conducted with-
in the allotted time frame (but it is ultimately up to EPA to agree to allow new re-
search to be conducted). Although we do not anticipate that many chemicals will re-
ceive  this  designation  each  year  or  that  additional  studies  will  be  requested  for  all
mission  critical  chemicals,  any  such  new  studies  will  help  fill  important  data  gaps
to ensure assessments of the highest quality.

Independent  external  peer  reviews  are  also  a  hallmark  of  EPA’s  commitment  to
ensuring  we  have  high-quality  science  that  has  been  vetted  by  a  panel  of  outside
experts.  Consistent  with  past  practices,  the  revised  process  specifies  that  all  draft
IRIS Toxicological Reviews will undergo independent external peer review. Most re-
views will be conducted by external peer review panels at public meetings, although
a  small  number  of  complex  or  high  profile  chemicals  may  undergo  more  in-depth
SAB or NAS peer reviews. As part of the revised IRIS process, external peer review-
ers will also for the first time have an opportunity to review the revised IRIS Toxi-
cological Review and comment on ORD’s responses to the peer reviewers and public
comments. This is an important step that is consistent with other peer review prac-
tices,  such  as  publishing  in  the  peer-reviewed  literature,  to  ensure  that  peer  re-
viewer comments are adequately addressed or sufficient rationale is provided for not
addressing such comments.

It  is  noteworthy  that  the  revised  IRIS  process  meets  many  of  the  recommenda-
tions  of  the  recently  issued  2008  GAO  report  entitled  ‘‘Toxic  Chemicals:  EPA’s  New
Assessment  Process  Will  Increase  Challenges  EPA  Faces  in  Evaluating  and  Regu-
lating  Chemicals’’  (GAO–08–743T).  Specifically,  the  revised  process  (1)  clearly  de-
fines and documents a streamlined IRIS assessment process; (2) sets time limits for
all parties, including OMB and other federal agencies, to provide comments to EPA
on draft IRIS assessments; (3) defines the appropriate role of external federal agen-
cies in EPA’s IRIS assessment process; and (4) determines the types of IRIS assess-
ments to conduct on the basis of the needs of EPA’s program offices and other users.
The  GAO  (2008)  report  also  lacks  an  appropriate  characterization  of  several  key
issues. For example, the GAO report erroneously suggests that only pure science is
involved  in  the  risk  assessment  process.  In  reality,  all  risk  assessments  (including
IRIS  assessments)  have  always  included  a  mix  of  science  and  science  policy,  as  ac-
knowledged in the NAS (1983) Red Book. The GAO report also mischaracterizes the
interagency review process at EPA. Specifically, to ensure that scientists and policy-
makers  are  able  to  have  full  and  frank  discussions  without  being  concerned  about
how these discussions may be viewed or misrepresented, all internal EPA comments
and interagency comments and disposition documents on draft IRIS assessments are
considered  ‘‘deliberative’’  and  do  not  become  a  part  of  the  public  record.  This  is  not
a  new  or  unique  process,  as  this  protection  is  the  same  as  that  afforded  any  other
policy-making  setting  at  EPA  (and  other  federal  agencies  follow  similar  processes).
Additionally, once EPA comes to a conclusion and releases its external review draft,
there  is  a  transparent  public  comment  and  external  peer  review  process.  The  GAO
report also incorrectly suggests that EPA will not have the final say on the content
of IRIS assessments under the revised process. However, despite increased opportu-
nities  for  public  and  other  agency  involvement,  the  revised  process  makes  it  clear
that all final decisions on content will remain within EPA.

EPA now needs time to implement and evaluate the new process, recognizing that
additional  changes  to  the  process  may  be  needed  in  the  future  (i.e.,  it  is  intended
to  be  a  ‘‘living’’  document).  Because  the  revised  process  attempts  to  streamline  and
set  specific  time  frames  for  each  step,  it  is  expected  to  reduce  the  amount  of  time
to complete future IRIS assessments.

Thank  you,  Chairman  Miller  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee  for  this  oppor-
tunity  to  describe  the  scope,  the  purpose  and  the  future  of  EPA’s  IRIS  program.  I
look forward to answering any questions you may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR GEORGE M. GRAY

On November 1, 2005, Dr. Gray was sworn in to serve as the Assistant Adminis-
trator  for  the  Office  of  Research  and  Development,  which  is  the  1,900-person,  $600
million  science  and  technology  arm  of  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency.  Dr.
Gray  was  appointed  to  this  position  by  President  George  W.  Bush  and  confirmed—
by unanimous consent—by the U.S. Senate.

Prior  to  joining  EPA,  Dr.  Gray  was  Executive  Director  of  the  Harvard  Center  for
Risk  Analysis  and  a  Lecturer  in  Risk  Analysis  at  the  Harvard  School  of  Public
Health  (HSPH).  In  16  years  at  HSPH,  his  research  focused  on  scientific  bases  of
human  health  risk  assessment  and  its  application  to  risk  policy  with  a  focus  on

STATEMENT  OF  MS.  SUSAN  E.  DUDLEY,  ADMINISTRATOR,  OF-
FICE  OF  INFORMATION  AND  REGULATORY  AFFAIRS  (OIRA),
OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET
Ms.  DUDLEY.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Miller  and  distinguished
Members of the Committee. As administrator of the Office of Infor-
mation  and  Regulatory  Affairs,  or  OIRA,  I  am  pleased  to  be  here
today to talk with you about OIRA’s role in ensuring that the high-
est  quality  of  information,  including  scientific  information,  is  used
and disseminated by federal agencies.

OIRA  was  created  as  part  of  the  Office  of  Management  and
Budget by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Staffed almost ex-
clusively  by  career  civil  servants,  OIRA  has  served  Administra-
tions,  both  Democratic  and  Republican,  for  decades  by  providing
centralized  oversight  and  interagency  coordination  of  federal  infor-
mation, as well as regulatory and statistical policy.

In recognition of the increasing importance of science-based regu-
lation at federal agencies, OIRA’s staffing has evolved over the last
8  years  to  include  scientific  and  engineering  expertise  to  accom-
pany  a  well-established  team  of  economists,  statisticians,  lawyers,
and information policy specialists. This more diversified pool of ex-
pertise  enables  us  to  engage  with  federal  experts  throughout  the
government on issues relevant to policy development.

Since  the  fall  of  2005,  OMB  has  coordinated  interagency  review
of  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency’s  IRIS.  IRIS  is  an  impor-
tant online database containing science and science policy informa-
tion  on  chronic  human  health  effects.  It  supports  risk-based  deci-
sion-making  not  only  by  EPA  but  by  other  federal  agencies,  State
and local environmental programs, international regulatory bodies,
academia, industry and others.

Interagency  coordination  allows  EPA  to  take  advantage  of  the
broad  scientific  expertise  that  exists  throughout  the  government.
The  science  in  IRIS  assessments  is  growing  more  and  more  com-
plex,  and  vigorous  discussion  among  a  diverse  set  of  governmental
experts  helps  EPA  ensure  that  the  IRIS  assessments  reflect  the
consensus  on  the  best  science  and  science  policy  judgments.  OMB
has  continually  supported  changes  that  will  improve  the  quality
and efficiency of the IRIS program.

Since  2000,  OMB  has  supported  funding  increases  of  over  450
percent, and IRIS’s program budget has increased from $1.7 million
in  fiscal  year  2000  to  $9.6  million  in  fiscal  year  2007.  Despite  this
increased  funding,  concerns  remain  with  the  pace  of  development
of IRIS assessments. EPA observes that assessments take an aver-
age of five years to complete, with some taking as long as 10 years.
In response to concerns both with delays in implementing IRIS as-
sessments  and  lack  of  transparency  in  the  IRIS  process,  EPA  has
recently  revised  the  process  to  clarify  the  role  of  the  public  and

interagency  reviewers  and  promote  greater  communication  and
sharing of information between all interested parties and EPA. The
new process is expected to reduce the time to complete an IRIS as-
sessment  from  the  historical  average  of  over  five  years  down  to
three  to  four  and  one-half  years.  EPA  expects  these  changes  will
result  in  a  more  predictable,  streamlined,  and  transparent  process
for  conducting  IRIS  assessments,  which  will  ultimately  lead  to  as-
sessments that are of the highest quality and rigor.

So  in  conclusion,  let  me  reiterate  a  few  key  points.  EPA’s  IRIS
database  is  a  highly  regarded  database  of  potential  chronic  effects
of environmental contaminants on human health. It is widely used
within  EPA,  by  other  federal,  State,  and  local  agencies  and  else-
where  to  support  policies  to  protect  human  health.  It  includes
science policies as well as pure science, quantitative risk estimates,
and qualitative narratives. Scientists at other federal agencies and
the public have an appropriate role in the development of IRIS as-
sessments. EPA’s recent clarifications to the process for developing
IRIS assessments should improve both the quality and efficiency of
assessments  by  engaging  the  public  as  well  as  experts  within  and
outside  the  government  earlier  in  the  process  and  providing
streamlined opportunity for review and comment.

I  have  a  few  seconds  left  on  my  clock.  I  would  like  to  correct  a
misimpression  that  may  have  been  left  from  the  last  panel.  OMB
did not review EPA’s response to the GAO report as was suggested.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF SUSAN E. DUDLEY

Chairman Miller, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, and distinguished Members of
the Committee, thank you for inviting me to testify at today’s hearing about the En-
vironmental  Protection  Agency’s  Integrated  Risk  Information  System  (IRIS)  data-
base policy.

As  the  Administrator  of  the  Office  of  Information  and  Regulatory  Affairs  (OIRA),
I  am  pleased  to  be  here  today  to  talk  with  you  about  OIRA’s  role  in  ensuring  that
the  highest  quality  of  information,  including  scientific  information,  is  used  and  dis-
seminated by federal agencies.

OIRA was created as part of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) by the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Staffed almost exclusively by career civil servants,
OIRA  has  served  Administrations,  both  Democratic  and  Republican,  for  decades  by
providing centralized oversight and interagency coordination of federal information,
as well as regulatory and statistical policy.

Over the last 27 years, OIRA’s interagency coordination role has been an integral
part of government accountability—a non-partisan tool for understanding the likely
effects  of  government  policy.  In  recognition  of  the  increasing  importance  of  science-
based regulation at federal agencies, OIRA’s staffing has evolved over the last eight
years to include scientific and engineering expertise to accompany a well established
team  of  economists,  statisticians,  and  information  technology  specialists.  This  more
diversified  pool  of  expertise  enables  us  to  engage  with  experts  throughout  the  Fed-
eral Government on issues relevant to policy development.

EPA’s Updated IRIS Process

The  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)’s  Integrated  Risk  Information  Sys-
tem  (IRIS)  is  an  online  database  prepared  and  maintained  by  the  EPA’s  National
Center  for  Environmental  Assessment  (NCEA)  within  the  Office  of  Research  and
Development (ORD). IRIS contains science and science policy information on chronic
human  health  effects.1 The  hazard  identification  and  dose-response  assessment  in-
formation in IRIS can be used in combination with exposure information to charac-

terize  the  public  health  risks  of  a  given  substance  in  a  given  situation.  These  risk
characterizations  can  form  the  basis  for  risk-based  decision-making,  regulatory  ac-
tivities,  and  other  risk  management  decisions  designed  to  characterize  and  protect
public  health.  The  IRIS  database  supports  risk-based  decision-making  not  only  by
EPA,  but  by  other  federal  agencies,  State  and  local  environmental  programs,  inter-
national  regulatory  bodies,  academia,  industry,  and  others.  According  to  EPA,  na-
tional  and  international  users  access  the  IRIS  database  approximately  nine  million
times a year.2

OMB  recognizes  the  importance  of  IRIS  assessments  for  making  sound,  science-
based decisions across the government, throughout the country, and internationally
as  well.  OMB  has  continually  supported  changes  that  will  improve  the  quality  and
efficiency of the IRIS program.

Since  2000,  OMB  has  supported  funding  increases  for  the  IRIS  program  of  over
450  percent;  as  evidenced  in  the  President’s  annual  budgets,  the  funding  requested
has increased from $1.7 million in FY 2000 to $9.6 million in FY 2007.3

Despite  these  funding  increases,  concerns  remain  with  the  pace  of  development
of  IRIS  assessments.  EPA  observes  that  prior  assessments  took  an  average  of  five
years  to  complete,  with  some  taking  as  long  as  10  years.4 In  response  to  concerns
both with delays in completion of IRIS assessments, and lack of transparency in the
IRIS process, EPA has recently revised the process to provide greater transparency,
objectivity,  balance,  rigor  and  predictability  in  IRIS  assessments.  The  revised  proc-
ess  clarifies  the  role  of  the  public  and  interagency  reviewers,  and  promotes  greater
communication  and  sharing  of  information  between  all  interested  parties  and  EPA.
EPA  expects  these  changes  to  result  in  a  more  predictable,  streamlined,  and  trans-
parent  process  for  conducting  IRIS  assessments,  which  will  ultimately  lead  to  as-
sessments that are of the highest quality and rigor.5

The  nomination  process  for  chemicals  to  be  included  in  IRIS  is  transparent  and
open.  ORD  initiates  the  process  through  a  Federal  Register  notice  which  invites
nominations from the public and at the same time reaches out to the EPA Program
and  Regional  Offices  and  other  agencies  for  their  nominations.  After  receiving  the
nominations  and  discussing  them  with  other  agencies  and  EPA  Program  and  Re-
gional  Offices,  EPA  determines  its  IRIS  agenda  for  the  coming  year,  and  publishes
that in the Federal Register. EPA’s determination is based on its published selection
criteria, as well as its available work force and areas of expertise.

EPA then begins the process of developing chemical health assessments that ulti-
mately  are  posted  to  the  IRIS  database.6 This  assessment  process  consists  of  13
steps:

1. A scientific literature search for each chemical;
2. A Federal Register notice seeking scientific information on selected chemical

substances;

3. EPA development of draft qualitative IRIS health assessment;
4. Review  of  the  draft  qualitative  assessment  within  EPA,  by  other  agencies,

and by the public, announced in the Federal Register;

5. EPA review of public and agency comments;
6. EPA evaluation of interagency interest in closing data gaps for mission crit-

ical chemicals;7

7. Design and implementation of new studies for mission critical chemicals, if

needed;

8. EPA completion of its draft IRIS review, including quantitative values;
9. EPA initiation of interagency review (and revision of draft assessment docu-

ments as appropriate);

OMB Role in the IRIS Process

Since  the  fall  of  2005,  OMB  has  coordinated  review  of  IRIS  assessments  (steps
9  and  12  in  the  new  process).  Interagency  coordination  allows  EPA  to  take  advan-
tage  of  the  broad  scientific  expertise  that  exists  throughout  the  government.  The
science  in  IRIS  assessments  is  growing  more  and  more  complex,  and  vigorous  dis-
cussion  that  involves  a  diverse  set  of  governmental  experts  helps  EPA  ensure  that
the IRIS assessments represent the consensus opinions of the government’s leading
scientists. In addition, risk assessment involves science policy judgments which help
to shape the risk assessment process. As many accepted ‘default’ positions are based
on  scientific  consensus  opinions,  a  frank  and  broad  discussion  among  interagency
experts helps to inform EPA’s choices.8 The agencies involved in any interagency re-
view  process  will  vary  depending  on  the  chemical  in  question,  agencies’  expertise,
and  agencies’  interest  in  it.  The  interagency  group  may  consist  of  representatives
from the following offices and departments:

• Office of Management and Budget (OMB),
• Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP),
• Council on Environmental Quality,
• Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (HHS)  [including  representation
from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), Centers
for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC),  National  Institutes  of  Health
(NIH),  National  Institute  for  Environmental  Health  Sciences  (NIEHS),  Na-
tional  Institute  for  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  (NIOSH)  and  Food  and
Drug Administration (FDA)],

• Department of Defense (DOD),
• Department of the Interior (DOI),
• Department of Labor (DOL),
• National Air and Space Administration (NASA),
• Department of Energy (DOE),
• Department of Transportation (DOT),
• Department of Agriculture (USDA), and
• the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).

In  step  9  noted  above,  EPA  provides  OMB  the  draft  health  assessment  and  the
draft charge to the external peer reviewers. OMB distributes these draft documents
to  the  others  in  the  interagency  group  for  review  and  comment.  EPA  then  revises
the  draft  health  assessment  and  charge,  as  appropriate,  to  respond  to  the  inter-
agency comments. After completing interagency review, EPA publishes the draft as-
sessment  in  the  Federal  Register  for  public  comment  and  begins  independent  peer
review.  After  revising  the  IRIS  assessment  based  on  peer  review  and  public  com-
ment, EPA again shares the assessment with OMB and other federal agencies (step
12 listed above).

Under EPA’s revised system, OMB will continue to coordinate interagency review
to help assure timely responses from agencies within designated review periods. For
step  9,  interagency  review  comments  are  due  within  30  to  60  days,  depending  on
the  complexity  of  draft  assessment  documents.9 EPA  will  respond,  as  appropriate,
in 15–30 days.10 At step 12, interagency and intra-agency review comments are pro-
vided to ORD within 30 days11 and ORD addresses any remaining issues within 15

days.12 In  addition,  the  EPA  web  page  allows  the  public  to  track  the  progress  of
each chemical as it moves through the IRIS assessment process.13

OMB  supports  the  new  EPA  IRIS  process  and  EPA’s  efforts  to  provide  greater
transparency,  and  opportunities  for  the  public  to  share  information  and  comment
on  EPA’s  assessment.  For  example,  the  public  has  an  opportunity  to  comment  on
EPA’s initial literature review and to present additional information on a chemical.
The public can also comment on the draft qualitative assessment and participate in
an  EPA-sponsored  ‘‘listening  session.’’  This  ‘‘listening  session’’  will  allow  for  broad
public participation earlier in the assessment process. The new process also defines
appropriate roles for the public and interagency interactions with ORD and also al-
lows  the  interagency  group,  as  well  as  the  EPA  Program  and  Regional  Offices,  in
addition  to  the  public,  opportunities  to  share  information  and  comment  on  EPA’s
draft  assessments.14 All  of  these  steps  will  also  help  to  ensure  the  high  quality  of
IRIS assessments. OMB also believes that the new process will increase efficiencies
in  the  IRIS  program.  EPA  estimates  that  the  new  process  will  reduce  the  time  to
complete an IRIS assessment from the historical average of over five years to three
to four and one-half years, with perhaps an additional one to two and one-half years
for the smaller number of mission critical chemicals.15 Thus this revised process not
only allows for earlier public and agency involvement, but also streamlines the proc-
ess  such  that  EPA  will  be  able  to  release  IRIS  assessments  in  a  more  timely  man-
ner.

Conclusion

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  in  today’s  hearing.  EPA’s  IRIS  database
is highly regarded and widely used. EPA’s recent clarifications to the process for de-
veloping IRIS assessments should improve both the quality and efficiency of the as-
sessments by engaging the public as well as experts within and outside the govern-
ment  earlier  in  the  process  and  providing  streamlined  opportunity  for  review.  I
would be happy to answer any questions you may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR SUSAN E. DUDLEY

Susan  Dudley  was  nominated  by  the  President  on  July  31,  2006,  and  appointed
on April 4, 2007, to serve as the Administrator of the Office of Information and Reg-
ulatory Affairs (OIRA) of the Office of Management and Budget.

Prior to her service at OIRA, from 1998 through January 2007, Ms. Dudley served
at  the  non-profit  Mercatus  Center  at  George  Mason  University,  where  she  directed
the Regulatory Studies Program from 2003 to 2006. As an Adjunct professor at the
George Mason University School of Law from 2002 to 2006, she designed and taught
courses on regulations and led regulatory clinics.

Earlier  in  her  career,  Ms.  Dudley  served  as  a  career  civil  servant,  working  as  a
policy  analyst  at  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (1984–1985),  an  economist
at OIRA (1985–1989), and an economist advisor to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission  (1989–1991).  From  1991  until  1998,  she  was  a  consultant  to  govern-
ment and private clients at Economists Incorporated.

Ms. Dudley has authored more than 25 scholarly publications on regulatory mat-
ters ranging from e-rule-making, to electricity, health care, the environment, and oc-
cupational safety. Before joining the Administration, she served on the boards of the
Association  of  Private  Enterprise  Education  and  the  International  Foundation  for
Research  in  Experimental  Economics,  which  was  founded  by  Nobel  Prize  winning
economist  Vernon  Smith.  She  has  also  served  as  a  citizen  member  of  several  com-
mittees  and  boards  in  the  Commonwealth  of  Virginia,  including  the  Virginia  Envi-
ronmental Education Advisory Committee (2000–2002), the Administrative Law Ad-
visory  Committee  (2000–2003),  and  the  Virginia  Waste  Management  Board  (1996–
2001).

Ms.  Dudley  holds  a  Master  of  Science  degree  from  the  Sloan  School  of  Manage-
ment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1981) and a Bachelor of Science
degree (summa cum laude) in Resource Economics from the University of Massachu-
setts, Amherst (1977). She lives in Virginia with her husband and two sons.

DISCUSSION

Chairman MILLER. Thank you, Ms. Dudley. There are only three
witnesses  today.  Mr.  Stephenson,  would  you  mind  rejoining  the
panel  so  you  might  be  able  to  respond  to  questions  that  were  di-
rected  to  all  of  us  because  your  testimony  has  been  very  different
from the testimony of that we have heard from others today.

Mr. STEPHENSON. Yes, it has.
Chairman  MILLER.  Again,  if  Mr.  Whittaker  could  put  up  Figure

1.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  might  note  that  we  didn’t

have these witnesses available to comment on his testimony——

Chairman MILLER. Well, they certainly——
Mr. ROHRABACHER.—to have the time when he was testifying. It

seems to be not quite a balanced decision on your part.

MORE ON EPA’S GAO EXIT CONFERENCE COMMENTS

Chairman  MILLER.  Dr.  Gray,  do  you  have  anything  to  say  in  re-

sponse to anything Mr. Stephenson said?

Dr.  GRAY.  There  are  areas  where  I  think  there  is  some

misperceptions in some of Mr. Stephenson’s testimony.

Chairman  MILLER.  Perhaps  we  can  elaborate  on  those  as  we  go

along. Ms. Dudley? Okay, could you——

Ms. DUDLEY. Yes, I do, too.
Chairman  MILLER.  Can  you  just  tell  me  the  topics  quickly  and
perhaps  we  can  try  to  hit  those  as  we  ask  questions,  Mr.  Rohr-
abacher and I.

Ms.  DUDLEY.  I  don’t  have  notes  on  all  the  topics.  One  was  the
notion  that  OMB  reviewed  EPA’s  response  to  the  GAO  report,
which is not true. OMB did not review that.

Chairman  MILLER.  You  have  already  said  that  that  was  simply

not true.

Ms. DUDLEY. Just the——
Chairman  MILLER.  Is  there  anything  that  you  want  to  elaborate

besides that it is not true?

Ms.  DUDLEY.  Yeah,  the  suggestion  that  OMB  doesn’t  have  sci-
entific  expertise.  You  know,  Mr.  Stephenson’s  response  was  that
there is no ‘‘s’’ in OMB but there is no ‘‘s’’ in GAO, either.

Chairman MILLER. Okay.
Mr. STEPHENSON. Or EPA.
Ms.  DUDLEY.  That  is  right.  So  I  don’t  think  whether  there  is  an

‘‘s’’ in the title of an agency qualifies.

Mr. STEPHENSON. Well, I didn’t mean that literally.

OMB’S ROLE IN RISK ASSESSMENTS

Chairman  MILLER.  Well,  we  haven’t  really  begun  our  line—well,
I guess I will now recognize myself for five minutes. Following that,
Ms.  Dudley,  do  you  think  it  is  part  of  the  role  of  OMB  or  allow  it
to review scientific assessments prepared by other agencies of gov-
ernment?

Ms. DUDLEY. OMB serves a coordinating function. We coordinate
interagency review of various things, so OMB’s role I think is a le-
gitimate  role.  We  have  scientists  that  engage  other  scientists
throughout  the  Federal  Government  in  reviewing  IRIS  assess-
ments.

Chairman  MILLER.  Well,  I  understand  that  there  is  one  toxi-

cologist that works for OIRA, is that correct?

Ms.  DUDLEY.  You  know,  I  am  not  sure  exactly  their  credentials.

We have toxicologists, risk assessors, statisticians.

Chairman  MILLER.  Well,  they  are  remarkably  productive,  be-
cause  they  respond  point  by  point  in  great  detail  at  great  length
to the assessments that come up from the scientific agencies of gov-
ernment.  Is  that  all  done  in-house  or  are  there  others  who  are  in-
vited to participate in OIRA’s work or OMB’s work?

Ms.  DUDLEY.  No,  it  is  certainly  an  interagency  effort.  So  OMB
doesn’t provide the—we don’t do the analysis, we coordinate it with
other  agencies.  So  we  take  advantage  of  the  expertise  throughout
the Federal Government. So at the——

Chairman MILLER. Do you take advantage of expertise outside of

the Federal Government?

Ms.  DUDLEY.  No,  as  a  rule,  OIRA  does  not  do  that.  Our  role  is

coordinating within the government.

MORE ON THE IRIS PROCESS

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  If  we  could  turn  back  our  attention  to
Figure 1. This is the IRIS process that existed before OMB, OIRA,
made helpful suggestions to make sure, to try to make this a more
productive transparent system, is that correct?

Ms. DUDLEY. I have to defer to Dr. Gray on that.

Dr.  GRAY.  The  first  thing  I  would  have  to  say  is  that  these  dia-
grams, I don’t necessarily—I am not able to endorse these because
I was not involved in preparing them. In fact, I will say——

Chairman MILLER. Actually it says—these are not diagrams pre-

pared by critics of OMB——

Dr. GRAY. No.
Chairman MILLER.—or EPA to belittle or make a mockery of the

complexity of the process. These are actually EPA documents.

Dr.  GRAY.  Yes,  they  are.  And  the  only  reason  I  am  unable  to
completely  verify  things  is  that  the  process  that  we  use  in  IRIS
prior  to  April  10th  was  never  written  down  and  made  publicly
available.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  But  if  we  could  now  look  at  Figure  3.

Ms.  DUDLEY.  May  I  ask,  do  you  have  hard  copies  of  those?  It  is

hard for us to see them on the screens.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. Is your need now satisfied? Okay. This
is  the  streamlined  version,  the  streamlined  transparent  version  of
the earlier, slow, opaque process, is that correct?

Dr. GRAY. This is——
Chairman MILLER. This is what is recently adopted.
Dr.  GRAY.  This  is  our  process,  yes,  that  is  how  to  find  many  of
those enhancements that I had mentioned that have been going on
in  the  IRIS  process  for  many  years.  They  are  designed  to  enhance
the transparency and the timeliness of the process and in fact put-
ting  timelines  on  this,  which  are  not  on  this  diagram  I  notice,  is
very helpful in that it reminds both EPA of its responsibilities and
the others who are involved in the responsibilities. It also indicates
all  of  the  various  places  where  the  EPA,  its  regions  and  program

Dr.  GRAY.  IRIS  is  an  input  to  the  risk  assessment  process.  It  is

not a complete risk assessment.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. But it is not risk management?
Dr. GRAY. That is correct.
Chairman  MILLER.  Ms.  Dudley,  it  is  not  risk  management,  cor-

Ms.  DUDLEY.  IRIS  is  not  risk  management.  It  is  a  component  of

the risk——

offices,  the  public,  non-governmental  organizations,  anyone  in  the
scientific community, and other agencies can come together to pro-
vide input to our process.

Chairman  MILLER.  That  is  a  yes.  Let  me  ask  the  same  question
that I asked of Mr. Stephenson to clarify or to summarize his testi-
mony response to Mr. Rohrabacher’s questions. Do either of you see
a  virtue  in  consciously  not  knowing  and  consciously  not  learning
the environmental or public health risk posed by a chemical? That
is a yes or no answer.

Ms. DUDLEY. No.
Dr. GRAY. Not at all. Not at all.
Chairman MILLER. None. And the purpose of IRIS is that, to as-

sess what the risk is.

Chairman  MILLER.  If  there  is  a  later  decision  about  what  to  do
about it, if a chemical poses a risk but the IRIS decision, the IRIS
listing is the best available science at the time of what risk a chem-
ical poses, isn’t that right?

Ms.  DUDLEY.  It  is  science  and  science  policy  because  science
doesn’t  give  you  the  full  answer,  so  there  are  policy  judgments  in-
volved.

Chairman MILLER. Well, the policy is what scientific assumptions

to make if the data is incomplete.

Ms. DUDLEY. That is correct. It deals with uncertainty.
Chairman  MILLER.  It  is  still  science.  A  policy  might  be,  do  we
really  need  to  use  TCE,  even  if  it  is  toxic,  because  our  machines,
our Bradley fighting vehicles, work better, and it is important that
our Bradley fighting vehicles work better. That is policy, right?

Dr. GRAY. Sir, could I make a statement? I know——
Chairman MILLER. That is risk management.
Dr.  GRAY.  That  is  management.  Risk  policy—I  notice  there  is  a
copy  of  the  NAS  Red  Book  next  to  you.  Chapter  1,  the  very  first
thing  after  defining  terminology  says  science  and  policy  and  risk
assessment. That is the kind of policy we are talking about.

Chairman MILLER. All right. Well, my time is expired. There will

be other opportunities. Mr. Rohrabacher for five minutes.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. So, Dr.
Gray,  you  were  mentioning  these  charts  that  have  been  shown  a
number  of  times  in  this  hearing.  So  you  are  suggesting  that  the
chart  that  has  been  given  to  us  during  this  hearing  is  not  an  offi-
cially approved chart from your agency?

Dr.  GRAY.  I  am  just  saying  that  I  was  not  involved  in  drafting
them,  and  it  is—there  are  questions  about  defining  the  previous
versions of the process simply because they were not written down
in the same way as we have now done.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  I  am  not  quite  understanding  the  answer,
whether  that  was—it  seems  that  you  are  saying  that  this  chart

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:30 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042370 PO 00000 Frm 00072 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O08\052108\42370 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

67

then  was  developed  by  somebody  in  your  agency,  that  it  was  not
officially  entitled  to  have  the  final  word  on  what  the  flow  chart
would——

Dr.  GRAY.  No,  I  don’t  think  that  is  quite  it.  It  is  my  under-
standing  that  those  were  put  together  in  an  effort  for  our  staff  to
come  up  here  and  brief  the  Committee,  and  we  use  those  to  brief
some other committees. What I am saying is I didn’t—I was not in-
volved  in  putting  those  together.  The  only  one  of  those  that  I  can
say  accurately,  to  the  best  of  my  knowledge,  completely  and  accu-
rately reflects the way things are done is the last one that does re-
flect the new process that we have released.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  So  the  complicated  flow  chart  that  we  see

does not reflect or does reflect——

Dr.  GRAY.  It  does  reflect  the  process  as  it  is  currently  defined.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. And what is your disagreement then with the
Chairman  on  the  flow  chart?  I  was  not  quite  understanding
why——

Dr. GRAY. Oh, simply——
Mr. ROHRABACHER.—you brought up that point.
Dr.  GRAY.  Well,  because  it  is  very  difficult  I  think  to  accurately
compare  these  because  in  the  past  this  process  has  not  been  writ-
ten down as explicitly and transparently as it is now so that know-
ing  exactly  what  the  process  was  in  each  of  those  steps  is  a  little
harder.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. So, the other flow chart, the original one that
has  been  presented  to  us  as  the  formerly  streamlined  process  now
has been made more complicated actually does not reflect the com-
plication of what it was before?

Dr.  GRAY.  Well,  to  me,  complication  is  not  what  this  is  about.
This  is  about  making  sure  we  are  doing  the  right  science.  Those
processes  that  we  were  looking  at  in,  I  believe  it  was  Chart  1  and
maybe Chart 2, are the ones that have us in the place today where
we  have  assessments  that  are  taking  over  10  years  to  do.  That  is
not  what  I  want,  that  is  not  what  EPA  needs.  The  new  process  is
designed  with  timelines  and  milestones  to  help  us  move  that  proc-
ess along, and actually though it may look more complicated, I be-
lieve it is both more streamlined and will be more efficient.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Okay.  So  what  you  are  suggesting  then  is
that  because  something  looks  more  complicated,  it  doesn’t  nec-
essarily mean that it is more time consuming and complicated?

Dr. GRAY. No, I would—that is exactly true.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, I think that is a disagreement you have

with our Chairman, but I will follow through on that.

Dr. GRAY. Thank you.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  I  think  that  sometimes,  yes,  I  really  under-

stand that you sometimes cannot believe your eyes. Thank you.

Chairman  MILLER.  Well,  as  I  said  in  the  opening  that  we
should—apparently  it  is  you  testimony  that  we  should  not  believe
our  lying  eyes,  that  the  flow  chart  that  was  prepared  by  IRIS
staff—I am advised by our Committee staff that all the charts were
prepared by IRIS committee staff and prepared to our staff as part
of our preparation for this hearing. Isn’t that correct?

Dr. GRAY. I believe that is what I said.

68

Chairman  MILLER.  You  may  not  have  done  it,  but  it  was  IRIS
staff  that  prepared  the  charts  that  describe  the  process  as  it  has
existed  along  the  way  before  2004,  before  OMB  and  OIRA  began
making helpful suggestions about how it might be different, how it
existed  from  2004  to  April  2008  and  how  it  exists  since  April  10,
2008, isn’t that right?

Dr. GRAY. That is correct.

HOW TRANSPARENT IS THE NEW IRIS PROCESS?

Chairman MILLER. All right. There has been discussion of trans-
parency.  Well,  it  is  not  really  possible  to  describe  how  many  steps
there are because there are so many kind of sub-numbers. But say
for  instance  looking  at  2F,  Step  2F,  federal  agencies  identify  mis-
sion  critical  chemicals.  Is  that  step  transparent?  Does  the  public
know what the agencies have had to say about what chemicals are
mission critical?

Dr.  GRAY.  The  designation  mission  critical  is  something  we  ex-
pect to happen very, very infrequently. When it does, it happens in
consultation  with  and  with  the  agreement  of  the  EPA.  If  that  in
fact  is  something  that  is—if  that  designation  is  made  and  agreed
to by the Agency, it would be certainly made known publicly.

Chairman MILLER. The final decision or the viewpoints that went

into the decision?

Dr.  GRAY.  The  decision  that  this  has  been  chosen  to  be  mission
critical and that the Agency had agreed that in fact there were spe-
cific  areas  of  research  that  could  be  conducted  in  a  short  amount
of  time  that  would  provide  additional  information  to  improve
the——

Chairman  MILLER.  How  about  Step  8B,  internal  Agency  review

of draft assessment?

Dr.  GRAY.  It  has  always  been  the  practice  that  our  discussions
that we have within our Agency where I can tell you there is rarely
scientific  agreement,  those  are  always  kept  deliberative  within  the
Agency.

Chairman  MILLER.  So  if  it  was  a  chemical  that  was  being  used
by  the  Department  of  Defense,  the  Department  of  Defense—that
would  be  the  step  at  which,  or  a  step  at  which  the  Department  of
Defense  would  say  whatever  they  had  to  say  about  TCE  being  on
the  IRIS  list?  Now,  whether  it  should  be  on  the  list  of  chemicals
that  we  know  something  about  the  risk—what  we  know  about  the
risk, is that right?

Dr.  GRAY.  I  am  sorry,  could  you—I  wasn’t  sure  what  your  ques-

tion was.

agency or is that——

Chairman  MILLER.  8B.  Internal  agency  review.  Is  that  all  your

Dr. GRAY. Yeah, no, that is EPA. As I said, our remarks in EPA
have  always  been  kept  deliberative,  if  it  is  something  that—and
are not released publicly.

Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  How  about  nine?  OMB  interagency
review of draft assessment and peer review charge? Is that public?

Dr. GRAY. No, that is interagency.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  And  what  would  happen  at  that  step?
Dr.  GRAY.  This  is  when  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget
would  coordinate  a  review  of  the  document  by  other  federal  agen-

cies.  Comments  would  come  in  to  EPA,  they  would  be  combined
with our comments that we had from within our agency and would
be considered in ultimately revising the document that would then
go  very  importantly  to  step  10A,  external  peer  review,  so  that  any
scientific choices, any scientific decisions that are made in that doc-
ument have to pass independent external peer review.

Chairman  MILLER.  Well,  who  would  be  commenting  at  that
point?  Would  the  Department  of  Defense—if  you  are  talking  about
a  chemical  used  by  the  Department  of  Defense,  would  the  Depart-
ment  of  Defense,  would  that  be  where  they  would  have  something
to say?

Dr.  GRAY.  This  process  opens  up  the  ability  for  comment  much

more broadly for the——

Chairman MILLER. Was that a yes?
Dr.  GRAY.—for  the  agencies,  for  the  public,  and  other  interested

parties.

Chairman  MILLER.  I  am  talking  about  nine,  interagency  review
of draft assessment peer. Is that where the Department of Defense
would have something to say?

Dr.  GRAY.  It  is  my  understanding,  and  I  don’t  know  how  OMB
does  the  formal  process  for  reviewing  these,  but  this  would  go  out
to  all  of  the  federal  agencies  to  have  an  opportunity  to  comment.

Chairman MILLER. And that would be——
Dr.  GRAY.  And  as  the  GAO  has  recognized—we  often  get  very

useful comments back from that interagency process.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. And that is public or private?
Dr. GRAY. Those are deliberative, within the executive branch.
Chairman MILLER. That means it is not public.
Dr. GRAY. That is correct.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Now,  if  this  is  all  about  what  risk  a
chemical  poses,  not  what  to  do  about  it,  what  risk  it  poses,  isn’t
that entirely a scientific decision?

Dr. GRAY. No——
Chairman  MILLER.  Are  toxicologists  at  DOD  commenting?  Who

are you getting from DOD?

Dr. GRAY. I don’t know who all of the commenters are, but again,
as GAO has recognized, EPA says those comments that come in are
useful.  But  again,  they  can  be  comments  on  science  and  on  the
science policy decisions and choices that are made——

Chairman  MILLER.  Which  is  also  science.  Which  is  also  science.
Dr. GRAY. No, we have——
Chairman MILLER. Of course it is.
Dr. GRAY. We have a separate process in our Agency for example
for  dealing  with  science  policy.  We  develop  guidelines  for  those
choices. They are vetted through our Science Policy Council.

Chairman MILLER. What would be the——
Dr. GRAY. We keep these two things separate.
Chairman MILLER. What would be the purpose of having this be
a deliberative process, rather than open, transparent, having every-
one  who  had  anything  to  say,  say  it  right  out  loud  in  front  of  God
and  everybody?  So  everybody  else  who  has  expertise  can  comment
on  what  they  had  to  say,  whether  their  factual  assumptions  are
correct, whether their analysis is correct or flawed, whatever. Isn’t

that the whole nature of peer review? Isn’t scientific analysis open?
Ms. Dudley?

Ms.  DUDLEY.  Mind  if  I  comment  on  that?  I  think  the  purpose  is
that healthy skepticism and frank discussions or candid discussions
among  scientists  throughout  the  government  actually  makes  for
better results. And let me just read to you from the National Acad-
emies—they  frequently  ask  questions.  ‘‘Deliberative  portions  of
meetings’’—and  this  is  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences—‘‘delib-
erative portions of meetings are closed to allow the discussions and
consensus  process  to  proceed  frankly  and  without  public  posturing
so  that  Committee  Members  are  free  to  change  their  positions  in
the  face  of  evidence  or  argument.’’  That  is  the  same  nature,  the
same reason as Dr. Gray said the discussions among EPA scientists
who  don’t  always  agree,  the  discussions  among  interagency  sci-
entists.  Providing  that  opportunity  for  candid,  frank  discussion  is
valuable.

Chairman MILLER. Mr. Stephenson, do you have anything to say

on this point?

Mr. STEPHENSON. Well, any time you want to question a risk as-
sessment, whether it is what Dr. Gray is referring to as science pol-
icy  or  not,  I  still  see  no  problem  with  the  toxicologist  at  DOD  sug-
gesting  that  you  don’t  have  a  good  enough  uncertainty  analysis.
Why  can’t  that  be  made  public,  the  basis  for  that  statement?  It  is
not to say that individual scientists within DOD statements would
be  available,  but  at  least  the  DOD  position  on  that  particular  risk
assessment  or  why  they  are  concerned  with  the  science  would  be
publicly  available.  I  can’t  understand  the  scenario  in  which  delib-
erative—if  it  encourages  more  frank  and  open  conversations  with
the  federal  family,  why  doesn’t  it  encourage  more  frank  and  open
conversations  with  other  public  commenters?  I  mean,  the  logic  de-
fies me.

Chairman  MILLER.  I  now  recognize  myself  for  another—well,  do
you wish, Dr. Gray, before I recognize myself for another five min-
utes, do you wish to comment on what Mr. Stephenson had to say?
Dr. GRAY. I did want to say that I think it is important for these
discussions  to  take  place.  One  of  the  new  enhancements  in  the
IRIS  process  that  is  here  is  something  that  we  call  listening  ses-
sions  in  which  we  open  up  and  invite  scientists  from  the  public,
from industry, from environmental organizations to all come in and
to  have  a  discussion  about  the  science  of  a  particular  assessment
at  two  different  points  here  to  make  sure  that  we  are  hearing  a
wide  range  of  views  and  we  are  getting  that  kind  of  input.  We
think that is very important.

Chairman MILLER. Now I recognize myself for five more minutes.
Is there any stage at which a TCE manufacturer would have a say?
Would a TCE manufacturer be able to talk to OMB? Would a TCE
manufacturer  fit  in  any  of  these  boxes?  Would  someone  outside  a
Federal  Government  agency  have  any  chance  to  comment  other
than the public comment?

Dr.  GRAY.  Can  I  say  right  here,  this  goes  back  to  my  previous
point of these listening sessions. Previously, there are contacts that
come  from  various  affected  parties.  It  may  be  an  industry  or  a
manufacturer or use——

Chairman MILLER. Right. You have to have public comment.

Dr. GRAY. No.
Chairman MILLER. That is not public, that is private.
Dr.  GRAY.  Now  in  the  new  process,  that  will  be  happening  in

these open public listening sessions.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. Is there an opportunity for a manufac-
turer other than a public open listening sessions to have a say? Do
they  fit  in  any  of  these  boxes  or  do  they  talk  to  OMB,  to  OIRA?
Dr. GRAY. I cannot speak for that. In our case, the intention now
is  to  have  these  listening  sessions  which  are  open,  publicly  avail-
able as the——

Chairman MILLER. Right.
Dr. GRAY.—way that anyone who wants to bring——
Chairman MILLER. Any chance——
Dr. GRAY.—information brings it in.
Chairman MILLER. Any chance to do it in a deliberative way, not

a public way, but deliberative way?

Dr. GRAY. No.
Chairman MILLER. Okay.
Mr. STEPHENSON. Mr. Chairman——
Chairman  MILLER.  Ms.  Dudley,  is  there  any  opportunity  for

deliberative——

Ms. DUDLEY. No, not to my knowledge.
Chairman MILLER. OMB doesn’t talk to manufacturers or no——
Ms.  DUDLEY.  We  talk  to  other  federal  scientists.  Our  role  is  co-
ordinating scientific dialogue between scientists within the Federal
Government.

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  Mr.  Chairman,  could  I  add  a  comment  here?
Chairman MILLER. Mr. Stephenson.
Mr.  STEPHENSON.  In  the  course  of  doing  our  work  and  having
discussions  with  DOD,  DOE,  and  NASA,  none  of  them  really  had
objections to their comments on the scientific risk assessment being
made  public.  So  I  am  not  sure  where  this  need  for  deliberation
comes from.

Chairman MILLER. All right. I am sorry, Dr. Gray and Ms. Dud-
ley, you are both testifying that there is no step in this whole proc-
ess,  there  is  no  procedure  by  which  a  private  party,  not  a  govern-
ment agency, a private party can participate formally or informally
in a deliberative way, not in a public way, but privately? Ms. Dud-
ley, is that correct?

Ms.  DUDLEY.  I  am  not  familiar  with  the  entire  process.  I  know
that  the  two  steps  that  OMB  manages—interagency  review—that
is  not  an  opportunity  for  people  outside  the  government  to  weigh
in.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. Now, both the EPA and OMB have re-
cently  asserted  in  Congressional  testimony  and  refused  to  answer
questions  based  upon  the  deliberative  process  privilege,  that  inter-
nal  government  discussions  are  not  subject  to—I  don’t  agree  with
it,  I  am  stating  that—the  assertion  the  privilege  that  EPA  and
OMB  has  asserted.  Do  you  contend  that  if  there  were  private  con-
versations  with  those  outside  of  government  that  they  would  be
subject to any privilege?

Ms.  DUDLEY.  I  am  not  a  lawyer.  I  know  that  our  process  is  that
in our regulatory review as well as the IRIS review, we do not talk
to people outside the government. In our regulatory review, we op-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:30 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042370 PO 00000 Frm 00077 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O08\052108\42370 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

erate under Executive Order 12866, and under that when we have
a  regulation  under  review,  if  we  are  to  meet  with  people  outside
the government, we post that on our website, we post the attendees
to that meeting and we also invite the agency.

There is a balance to be struck, and I understand where you are
going. There is a balance to be struck between a deliberative proc-
ess  to  allow  for  that  frank  and  candid  discussion  and  also  for  the
public’s  need  for  transparency  and  need  to  know.  And  I  think  we
try  to  strike  that  balance.  In  the  IRIS  process,  it  is  through  this
new  procedure,  and  in  the  regulatory  process  it  is  through  our
transparent  posting  of  meetings  with  people  outside  the  govern-
ment.

Chairman  MILLER.  Dr.  Gray,  the  head  of  your  agency  asserted
that privilege yesterday and refused to answer a direct question in
another committee.

Ms.  DUDLEY.  Actually,  if  I  could  just  quickly  correct  that.  I  was

sitting next to him, and he did not assert that privilege.

Chairman  MILLER.  I  am  sorry.  He  didn’t  actually  say  those
words,  he  just  said  he  wasn’t  going  to  answer.  So  do  you  intend,
assert that I-don’t-feel-like-telling-you privilege?

Ms.  DUDLEY.  Only  the  President  can  assert  Executive  Privilege,
and to my knowledge he has not done that in the issue of the testi-
mony yesterday nor today.

Chairman  MILLER.  Do  you  have  any  idea  of  the  nature  of  the
privilege upon which the head of the EPA was lying in refusing to
answer direct questions in a committee?

Ms. DUDLEY. Are we discussing yesterday or on IRIS?
Chairman  MILLER.  Well,  I  am  trying  to  figure  out  which  one  of
these  is  going  to  be  available  to  a  Congressional  oversight  com-
mittee.

Ms. DUDLEY. On this issue, actually, Dr. Gray is probably better
to  answer.  But  after  the  assessments  have  gone  through  inter-
agency review, they are available for public peer review, and all the
information  on  which  those  assessments  rely  is  available  for  sci-
entists  outside  the  government  or  the  general  public  outside  the
government to evaluate.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Dr.  Gray,  did  you  have  an  answer  to

that question?

Dr.  GRAY.  I  would  agree  completely  with  what  Ms.  Dudley  has
just said. No, there is—here the only things—there is a deliberative
process with the discussions that we have within the EPA and the
discussions that we have with the other federal agencies. When the
ultimate  decisions  are  made,  the  choices,  the  data,  the  endpoints
in  an  IRIS  assessment,  those  are  put  forth  in  a  transparent  way
and go out for independent, external peer review to make sure that
the  science  choices,  the  science  assumptions,  the  data  choices  we
have made are scientifically appropriate.

Chairman  MILLER.  Dr.  Gray,  Mr.  Stephenson  said  a  minute  ago

that—he listed three agencies, NASA and who else?

Mr. STEPHENSON. DOE and DOD.
Chairman  MILLER.  They  say  they  don’t  mind  commenting  right
out  loud  in  front  of  God  and  everybody.  They  don’t  need  for  it  to
be  privileged  or  private,  deliberative.  They  are  willing  to  say  what

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:30 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042370 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O08\052108\42370 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

73

they have to say publicly. Are there agencies that have objected to
having their comments be public?

Dr.  GRAY.  The  deliberative  steps  here  were  decisions  that  were
taken  by  the  EPA  to  make  these  steps  deliberative  as  they  have
been  in  the  past  and  as  is  done  with  other  kinds  of  reviews  that
we have.

Ms.  DUDLEY.  Excuse  me  sir,  do  you  mind  if  I  comment  on  that?
Chairman MILLER. Sure.
Ms.  DUDLEY.  Any  agency  that  wants  to  make  that  information
public  certainly  can  do  that  during  the  comment  period.  So  there
is  nothing  in  this  process  that  would  bar  them  from  making  that
information public.

TIMELINES FOR IRIS ASSESSMENTS

Chairman  MILLER.  I  understand  this  has  only  been  in  effect
since  April  10,  2008,  and  it  is  designed  to  streamline  the  process
so  that  it  would  be  more  productive  and  that  more  chemicals  will
be  assessed.  We  won’t  still  be  waiting  11  years  after  formaldehyde
was  submitted  for  re-evaluation,  and  formaldehyde  is—we  have
had another Subcommittee hearing on formaldehyde. It would have
been  nice  to  have  for  the  EPA  and  FEMA  and  for  the  Centers  for
Disease  Control  to  have  a  picture  of  formaldehyde’s  likely  toxicity,
likely  risk,  based  on  the  current  science.  But  it  still  hasn’t  hap-
pened.  When  are  we  going  to  know  that  this  is  actually  producing
more  assessments?  Four  in  the  last  two  years  does  not  seem  like
the changes made in 2004 resulted in a leap in productivity. When
are  we  doing  to  know  if  this  is  now  going  to  fix  whatever  errors
there  are?  Mr.  Stephenson  thinks  that  it  will  not  but  it  will  make
it worse. When are we going to decide who is correct?

Dr.  GRAY.  Well,  I  would  say  that  we  agree,  that  there  are  real
issues  with  the  development  of  IRIS  assessments  and  their  timeli-
ness.  These  delays  have  been  a  longstanding  issue,  and  it  is  very
clear  the  fact  that  we  have  a  significant  number  that  have  taken
10  years  or  more,  that  a  lot  of  the  delays  predate  any  changes  in
this  process.  Our  goal  is  to  have  a  process  that  will  increase  the
rigor  and  the  timeliness  with  these  timelines  that  will  provide
strict  milestones  for  EPA  and  for  the  other  parties  in  this  entire
process  to  move  this  along.  I  think  what  we  need  now  is  time  to
implement this process, to evaluate it. It is intended to be a living
document,  recognizing  it  may  need  future  revisions,  but  I  think
that the process that we have been using certainly hasn’t gotten us
to the place we want to be.

timelines?

Chairman MILLER. Ms. Dudley.
Ms. DUDLEY. You know, I wasn’t involved in developing the new
IRIS process, but the fact that it has timelines for every step along
the way, including interagency comment and EPA response to that,
I  think  will  both  streamline  the  process  and  improve  the  quality
and rigor of the resulting assessments.

Chairman MILLER. What are the consequences of not meeting the

Ms. DUDLEY. I don’t know that there are any consequences.
Dr.  GRAY.  No,  but  these  are  intended  as  part  of  a  management
system  that  we  are  implementing  so  that  people  know  on  our  side
how  we  expect  them  to  do  their  work  and  when  we  expect  them

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:30 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042370 PO 00000 Frm 00079 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O08\052108\42370 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

to do their work when we deal with the other agencies how things
go. For example, one of the things that is commonly done is to sug-
gest  to  an  agency,  if  we  don’t  hear  from  you  in  some  amount  of
time, we assume you have no comments. Those sorts of things may
well  be  the  way  in  which  this  would  work  to  help  make  sure  that
things keep to the timelines.

Chairman MILLER. Mr. Stephenson, when do you have a sense of

how well this is working?

Mr. STEPHENSON. If you look at the timeframes that are missing
from  your  chart  with  this  system,  we  already  know  that  it  is  not
going to work.

Chairman MILLER. And how is that?
Mr.  STEPHENSON.  All  we  did  was  add  up  the  timeframes  which,
as  you  just  heard,  may  or  may  not  have  consequences.  We  added
them  up  through  this  flow  chart,  and  they  total  six  years.  And  if
it  is  a  mission  critical  system,  the  DOD  commenter  or  whomever,
has  the  ability  to  ask  for  additional  research,  which  can  take  up
to 18 more months. It is already broken.

Dr.  GRAY.  I  would  like  to  suggest  that  in  fact  this  process  I  be-
lieve  can  help  us  get  done  in  less  time  than  our  current  five  and
one-half  year  per  assessment  average;  if  you  add  up  the  timelines
and remove those small fraction of chemicals that might be consid-
ered mission critical, this is something that will take less time than
our  current  process  and  will  be  more  responsive,  more  rigorous,
and more transparent.

Mr.  STEPHENSON.  We  are  not  thrilled  with  the  current  process.
Chairman  MILLER.  Are  there  no  milestones  at  all  in  the  current

process, in the previous process?

Dr.  GRAY.  There  are  none  that  are  written  down  and  publicly

available.

Chairman MILLER. Okay.
Mr.  STEPHENSON.  That  is  the  improvement.  It  is  no  longer  ad

hoc. Now you know what the process is.

Ms.  DUDLEY.  Sir,  I  actually  have  a  chart  that  I  don’t  know—did
you get this just before the hearing? I am sorry that we don’t have
it so that you can put it up.

Chairman MILLER. I haven’t seen it but perhaps the staff has.
Ms.  DUDLEY.  What  it  does  is  it  takes  a  look—EPA  has  data  on
the number of IRIS assessments completed going back to 1997. The
GAO  reports—I  am  not  sure  what  day  it  starts,  but  it  doesn’t  go
back  as  far  as  we  have  data.  And  that  suggests  that  there  are  in-
creases—that  you  see  increases  and  decreases  in  the  assessments
but that on average in the last three years of the previous adminis-
tration, there were four assessments per year, whereas the average
between  2000  and  2007  has  been  4.6.  So  I  think  we  all  agree  that
the  process,  that  it  is  too  slow  and  we  need  to  speed  that  up,  but
I think it is not fair to characterize the previous way as the golden
age and the future as a slowing of the process.

Mr. STEPHENSON. I agree with that.
Chairman  MILLER.  I  am  advised  by  our  staff  that  we  do  have
this  but  we  got  it  15  minutes  before  the  hearing.  So  there  has  not
exactly been an ample opportunity to look at it closely.

That  is  the  end  of  the  hearing  today.  Thank  you  all  for  appear-
ing.  We  did  have  an  earlier  hearing  on  the  issue  of  formaldehyde
in  trailers  provided  by  FEMA.  And  an  effort  began  in  1997  to  up-
date the listing for formaldehyde. The equivalent agencies through
the  EPA  and  other  developed  countries  list  formaldehyde  as  a
known  carcinogen.  It  is  still  listed  as  a  suspected  carcinogen,  and
since  1997,  there  has  not  been  a  completed  revision  of
formaldehyde’s  risk  to  the  public,  risk  to  health,  risk  to  the  envi-
ronment.  There  were  hundreds  and  thousands  of  people  who  were
living in trailers provided by FEMA that used particle board made
with  formaldehyde  with  high  levels  of  formaldehyde  in  the  air  in-
side  the  trailers,  with  families  who  were  displaced  by  Katrina  and
by  Rita  breathing  that  air  every  day.  It  would  have  been  nice  to
have a current assessment of the health consequences for formalde-
hyde  that  FEMA  could  have  relied  upon,  that  the  Centers  for  Dis-
ease Control could have relied upon, and that the Agency for Toxic
Substances  and  Disease  Registry,  ATSDR,  could  have  relied  upon
instead of saying, well, just open the windows and doors. If in fact
formaldehyde  is  a  substantially  greater  health  risk  than  the  now
more  than  decade  old  assessment,  that  is  a  current  science.  There
is  no  virtue—and  I  agree  with  all  of  the  witnesses  today—there  is
no  virtue  in  not  knowing.  There  is  no  virtue  in  not  finding  out.
This  is  not  a  process  about—ours  is  not  intended  to  be  health  or

77

risk  management.  It  is  not  what  to  do  about  the  fact  that  there  is
a risk, it is what is the risk? And there is no virtue in not knowing.
But  it  is  hard  to  look  at  EPA’s  performance  and  not  conclude  that
we are not doing a sufficient job in determining which of the 80,000
chemicals present a hazard and what the hazard is.

So I thank all of you for appearing today, and we will pursue this

further. Thank you. The hearing is adjourned.

[Whereupon, at 12:50 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Toxic Communities: How EPA’s IRIS Program

Fails the Public

THURSDAY, JUNE 12, 2008

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

The  Subcommittee  on  Investigations  and  Oversight  will  hold  the  second  hearing
on  the  Integrated  Risk  Information  System  (IRIS)  at  the  Environmental  Protection
Agency (EPA).

On May 21, 2008, the Subcommittee heard the Government Accountability Office’s
(GAO)  evaluation  of  the  Administration’s  new  process  for  reviewing  and  approving
chemical  assessments  for  inclusion  in  the  IRIS  database.  In  their  March  2008  re-
view of EPA’s IRIS program GAO found that the IRIS database was at serious risk
of becoming obsolete because the Agency has not been able to complete credible as-
sessments in a timely manner or to reduce the backlog of 70 assessments that were
in  the  development,  review  or  approval  process.1 In  their  subsequent  examination
of  the  process  implemented  by  the  Administration  on  April  10,  2008,  GAO  testified
that the recent assessment process changes arid the other process changes being im-
plemented  by  EPA  were  likely  to  increase  the  time  needed  to  finalize  IRIS  assess-
ments and to further reduce the credibility of IRIS assessments.2

The witnesses will address the role of IRIS assessments in the regulatory process
for  implementing  environmental  statutes  administered  by  EPA  and  by  State,  terri-
torial,  and  tribal  governments  and  the  consequences  of  extended  delay  in  the  IRIS
assessment process for public health. They will also address questions regarding the
Bush  Administration’s  evolving  system  to  draft  and  review  IRIS  entries.  Witnesses
include:

• Mr. Jerome Ensminger, Master Sergeant U.S. Marine Corps (ret.)
• Mr. Lenny Seigel, Center for Public Environmental Oversight
• Dr. Linda Greer, Senior Scientist, Natural Resources Defense Council
• Dr. David G. Hoel, Professor, Medical University of South Carolina

What Is the Role of an IRIS Assessment in the Regulatory Process?

Federal  and  State  governments  adopt  environmental  and  public  health  laws  to
protect natural resources and the public. EPA, State, territorial, anal tribal govern-
ments  implement  environmental  statutes  through  the  issuance  of  regulations  that
set standards for air and water quality and for clean-up of contaminated areas. Reg-
ulations  also  set  deadlines  for  achieving  the  standards.  At  the  federal  level,  EPA
administers  environmental  statutes  to  protect  public  health  and  the  environment,
to  establish  criteria  for  the  handling  and  disposal  of  hazardous  materials,  and  that
govern  the  clean-up  of  contaminated  land  and  water.  The  preparation  of  a  regula-
tion requires assembling a wide variety of information to define risk and justify the
risk management approach mandated by the regulation. In addition to the informa-
tion and procedural requirements imposed by individual statutes, there are general
statutes  governing  the  issuance  of  regulations  by  federal  agencies  that  also  impose
procedural  and  information  requirements  (e.g.,  Administrative  Procedures  Act,  Pa-
perwork  Reduction  Act,  Unfunded  Mandates  Reform  Act)  and  there  are  Executive

Orders  and  guidance  from  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB)  that  also
require procedures and analyses to be done in support of a regulation.

Two  of  the  most  commonly  required  analyses  are  risk  assessments  and  cost-ben-
efit  analyses.  While  not  a  regulatory  product  itself,  IRIS  is  designed  to  help  regu-
lators set priorities about what to regulate and inform regulators on a safe exposure
level for workers or communities. An IRIS assessment provides a hazard identifica-
tion and dose-response analysis, scientific information that when combined with es-
timates  of  exposure  allow  regulatory  agencies  to  produce  a  risk  assessment.  Delay
in  the  production  of  the  IRIS  assessment  translates  into  delay  in  implementation
of  environmental  statutes  and  in  establishment  of  standards  to  protect  public
health.

While  some  State  governments  have  environmental  programs  that  independently
establish standards (e.g., California), many State governments and virtually all ter-
ritorial  and  tribal  governments  rely  upon  the  Federal  Government  to  develop  and
evaluate  the  scientific  information  that  will  determine  safe  levels  of  exposure  and
allow regulatory agencies to set standards for air and water quality to protect public
health  and  the  environment.  For  example,  in  response  to  EPA’s  solicitation  to  set
priorities  for  developing  IRIS  assessments,  the  State  of  Minnesota  submitted  a  list
of 52 chemicals of concern.3

The  Case  of  Trichloroethylene:  How  Long  Does  a  Controversial  IRIS  As-

sessment Take to Complete?

In its March 2008 report on EPA’s IRIS program GAO examined six specific IRIS
assessments  that  are  in  process.4 One  of  the  six  assessments  was  of  trichloro-
ethylene  or  TCE.  GAO’s  report  provided  the  following  timeline  for  the  development
of  a  cancer  assessment  of  TCE  for  inclusion  in  the  IRIS  database:  EPA  developed
a  cancer  assessment  of  TCE  for  inclusion  in  the  IRIS  database,  but  withdrew  it  in
response to peer reviewers’ comments in 1989. EPA initiated a new TCE cancer as-
sessment  in  1998  and  issued  a  new  draft  assessment  in  2001.  This  draft  and  its
findings  were  controversial.  It  was  reviewed  by  EPA’s  Science  Advisory  Board  and
released  for  public  comment.  The  National  Academy  of  Sciences  (NAS)  was  asked
to review the draft and to resolve issues raised in the SAB review and through the
public comment process about methods EPA used to assess the risk of TCE. In 2006,
the NAS panel released their report. The panel stated:

The  committee  found  that  the  evidence  on  carcinogenic  risk  and  other  health
hazards  from  exposure  to  trichloroethylene  has  strengthened  since  2001.  Hun-
dreds  of  waste  sites  in  the  United  States  are  contaminated  with  trichloro-
ethylene,  and  it  is  well  documented  that  individuals  in  many  communities  are
exposed to the chemical, with associated health risks. Thus, the committee rec-
ommends  that  federal  agencies  finalize  their  risk  assessment  with  currently
available  data  so  that  risk  management  decisions  can  be  made  expeditiously.5
Despite  this  direction  from  the  NAS  to  move  forward,  EPA  has  not  yet  released
its assessment of TCE. According to GAO, the assessment is back at the draft devel-
opment stage and will not be finalized until 2010.

What  Are  the  Consequences  for  Public  Health  When  IRIS  Assessments  Are

Delayed?

TCE is a solvent that has been in commerce since the 1920s. TCE is a degreasing
agent and has been widely used in manufacturing and industrial settings. It is one
of  the  most  commonly  identified  contaminants  at  sites  included  on  EPA’s  National
Priority  List  (NPL)  under  the  Superfund  program.  It  is  a  found  in  air,  water,  and
soils. A number of different cancers, reproductive and developmental problems, neu-
rotoxic effects, and auto-immune disease have all been associated with exposures to
TCE.

Since  TCE  is  a  contaminant  of  air,  water,  and  soils  its  clean-up  is  determined
through  various  statutes  administered  by  EPA  including:  the  Safe  Drinking  Water
Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensa-
tion,  and  Liability  Act  (CERCLA)  or  Superfund.  Under  each  of  these  statutes,  EPA

has  the  authority  to  set  maximum  contaminant  levels  that  define  safe  drinking
water,  set  air  quality  standards  that  define  clean  air,  and  that  set  standards  for
clean-up of contaminated soil and water at Superfund sites. These standards cannot
be  strengthened,  until  EPA  has  completed  the  IRIS  assessment,  a  risk  assessment,
and  other  supporting  studies  and  information  requirements  (e.g.,  cost-benefit  anal-
ysis,  regulatory  impact  analyses,  etc.)  needed  to  support  a  regulation.  Many  people
believe  the  TCE  standards  currently  in  place  are  inadequate  to  protect  human
health especially that of children and other sensitive sub-populations.

The  Subcommittee  will  hear  from  two  witnesses  whose  family  or  communities
have  experienced  serious  health  impacts  that  are  associated  with  exposure  to  TCE.
One  of  the  sites  listed  on  the  Superfund  NPL  is  Camp  Lejeune,  the  Marine  Corps
base  in  North  Carolina.  The  drinking  water  source  for  the  base  is  contaminated
with TCE and tetrachloroethylene (PCE or perc): The Marine Corps closed contami-
nated  drinking  water  wells  in  1985,  and  the  site  was  listed  in  1989.  The  Agency
for  Toxic  Substances  and  Disease  Registry  estimated  that  up  to  one  million  people
were exposed to these toxic contaminants before the contaminated wells were closed
in 1985.

The community of Mountain View, California has several TCE clean-up sites. Sev-
eral of the contaminated sites are located on federal lands including the Orion Park
Military  Housing  Area  (U.S.  Army).  These  areas  are  still  undergoing  clean-up  and
remediation  and  residents  of  the  area  are  still  exposed  to  TCE  through  a  process
known as vapor intrusion.

Mr.  Ensminger  and  Mr.  Seigel  will  discuss  the  experiences  of  their  family  and
community,  respectively  and  why  they  believe  EPA’s  IRIS  program  needs  reform.

The  Minnesota  Department  of  Health  Submission  to  the  In-
tegrated  Risk  Information  System  (IRIS);  Request  for
Chemical Substance Nominations for 2007 Program

(DOCKET ID NO. EPA–HQ–ORD–2006–0950)

The  Health  Risk  Assessment  staff  at  the  Minnesota  Department  of  Health  wish
to  nominate  a  list  of  chemicals  to  be  included  in  the  Integrated  Risk  Information
System  (IRIS);  Request  for  Chemical  Substance  Nomination  for  2007  Program.
These chemicals are of concern to the Minnesota Department of Health because they
are  among  contaminants  found  in  Minnesota  groundwater.  In  Minnesota,  health
based values are derived for such contaminants. When conducting risk. assessments,
the  Minnesota  Department  of  Health  has  relied  upon  the  IRIS  summaries  as  a  re-
source  for  the  development  of  these  health  protective  values.  Therefore,  it  is  our
hope  that  you  take  our  nominated  chemicals  in  consideration.  By  obtaining  IRIS
summaries  of  these  chemicals  it  will  result  in  a  more  thorough  and  accurate  risk
assessment process.

In  addition,  the  Minnesota  Department  of  Health  currently  needs  and  uses  ref-
erence  concentrations  and  reference  doses  for  less  than  chronic  periods  of  exposure
to  assess  risks  from  a  variety  of  exposure  scenarios.  These  scenarios  include  less
than  chronic  exposures  that  commonly  occur  at  contaminated  sites  resulting  in  the
need for less than chronic toxicity values to assess current risks. The EPA 2002 ‘‘A
review of the reference dose and reference concentration processes’’ has guided much
of the practice of the Department in this area.

The  Department  has  found  that  health  effects  that  result  from  less  than  chronic
periods  of  exposure,  when  combined  with  high  drinking  water  exposures  associated
with  specific  life  stages  (e.g.,  childhood),  result  in  drinking  water  values  that  are
lower  and  therefore  more  appropriate  as  drinking  water  standards  for  the  general
population than the value calculated using a chronic reference dose and lifetime av-
erage dose. As a result, the Department is very interested in recent efforts by IRIS
to develop less than lifetime reference values, and urges the EPA to continue to de-
velop  and  publish  these  analyses.  The  Department  also  urges  the  EPA  to  consider
the  potential  that  effects  observed  in  chronic  studies  result  from  early  exposures
rather  than  continuous  exposure.  To  the  extent  that  studies  are  available,  the  De-
partment urges the EPA to present acute, short-term, longer-term, and chronic eval-
uations (recommendations for critical studies for each and resulting reference doses)
for each chemical that undergoes review in the future.

Chairman  MILLER.  The  hearing  will  come  to  order.  Good  morn-
ing,  and  welcome  to  our  second  hearing  on  EPA’s  Integrated  Risk
Assessment System, IRIS.

The  glacial  pace  at  which  EPA  is  completing  assessments  of
chemicals  has  real  consequences  for  public  health,  and  tragic  con-
sequences  for  human  beings  and  their  families.  Completion  of  an
IRIS  assessment  is  just  the  first  step  in  the  process  of  protecting
people  from  dangerous  exposures  to  toxic  chemicals.  With  an  IRIS
assessment in place, it is easier to deal with the clean-up of chem-
ical  contamination  of  the  air  or  water,  to  adopt  safer  practices  in
the  workplace,  and  to  consider  steps  to  regulate  toxic  substances
that can harm our children and our communities.

The  Government  Accountability  Office’s  recent  report  on  IRIS
concluded that EPA’s process for initiating and completing IRIS as-
sessments  resulted  in  proposals  that  are  now  in  preparation  for
more  than  five  years,  with  some  assessments  taking  more  than  a
decade.  The  new  process  that  EPA  and  OMB  instituted  just  in
April will add additional years to our assessments, according to the
GAO conclusions.

The  years  of  study  and  discussion  regarding  IRIS  assessments
comes  on  top  of  a  regulatory  process  that  is  burdened  with  time-
consuming  steps  for  complete  risk  assessment,  cost  benefit  anal-
ysis, and internal and external reviews, all as laid out in Executive
Orders  and  in  statute.  Even  after  a  regulation  is  finalized,  it  can
be  challenged  in  court  and  sent  back  to  the  Agency  for  revision.
When  finally  established,  a  new  regulation  usually  includes  some
time,  often  many  years,  for  the  affected  parties  to  transition  away
from the practices that are being regulated.

During  this  entire  process,  exposures  continue,  toxic  substances
remain  unregulated  or  under-regulated  in  commerce,  and  contami-
nation is not cleaned up, or not cleaned up to a level that we think
is actually safe.

Today,  we  will  hear  from  people  who  have  lived  and  are  living
with  those  consequences.  These  people  will  describe  what  their
families  and  communities  have  endured  for  years,  situations  that
no one would wish to endure for a day.

While  the  failures  of  the  IRIS  database  are  not  responsible  for
these  experiences,  the  gaps  in  IRIS  and  the  improper  intrusion  of
politics  into  database  entries  have  likely  contributed  to  the  situa-
tions  that  these  people  and  their  communities  have  had  to  deal
with.  When  State  and  local  authorities  get  poor  information  or  no
information regarding the health hazards of a particular pollutant,
their  response  to  pollution  in  a  community  is  likely  to  be  confused
and  confusing.  When  citizens  can’t  turn  to  IRIS  for  information—
and  the  database  gets  20,000  web  hits  a  year—then  it  is  hard  for
them  to  know  what  they  are  fighting  in  terms  of  clean-ups  and
health risks.

The worst thing about these families’ experiences is that they are
likely  to  be  repeated  because  exposures  that  led  to  the  chemical
that led to the problems continue. TCE was discovered in the early
1900s and has been on the market and widely used since the 1920s
as  a  degreaser.  Discovery  of  its  toxic  properties  eliminated  its  use
as an analgesic in the 1930s, and by the 1970s, evidence in animal
experiments  showed  that  it  might  cause  cancer.  It  is  one  of  the

most  frequently  occurring  contaminants  in  Superfund  sites,  and  it
is present in air, drinking water, and soils.

EPA has been working on a revised TCE assessment since 1989.
Two  years  ago,  following  interventions  by  NASA,  the  Department
of  Energy,  the  Department  of  Defense,  and  OMB,  the  National
Academy  reviewed  EPA’s  draft  IRIS  assessment  and  the  science
available on TCE, and said that ‘‘evidence on carcinogenic risk and
other health hazards from exposure to TCE has strengthened since
2001.  Priority  should  be  given  to  finalizing  the  risk  assessment  so
that risk management decisions can be made expeditiously.’’

Expeditious is not a word that describes this situation. GAO esti-
mates  that  EPA  will  not  complete  their  TCE  assessment  until
2010. That is 21 years from the start date. If they completed their
assessment  in  2010,  we  will  still  be  years  away  from  real  regu-
latory action. People have been exposed to a known toxic substance
for  decades  for  a  generation  while  their  government  has  engaged
in  one  study  after  another.  Have  we  become  so  obsessed  with  get-
ting  the  science  exactly  right  that  we  have  lost  sight  of  our  real
goal,  protecting  public  health?  Or  is  getting  the  science  exactly
right  a  pretext  for  obstruction  of  any  real  protection  of  the  public.
This system defies common sense. It is broken. It is condemning

people to future health problems.

I  now  yield  to  my  distinguished  colleague,  the  Ranking  Member
of  the  Subcommittee,  Mr.  Sensenbrenner,  for  an  opening  state-
ment.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Miller follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BRAD MILLER

Good  morning  and  welcome  to  our  second  hearing  on  EPA’s  Integrated  Risk  As-

sessment System (IRIS).

The  glacial  pace  at  which  EPA  is  completing  assessments  of  chemicals  has  real
consequences  for  public  health  and  tragic  consequences  for  individuals  and  their
families.

Completion  of  an  IRIS  assessment  is  just  the  first  step  in  the  process  protecting
people  from  dangerous  exposures  to  toxic  chemicals.  With  an  IRIS  assessment  in
place,  it  is  easier  to  deal  with  the  clean-up  of  chemical  contamination  of  the  air  or
water,  to  adopt  safer  practices  in  the  workplace  and  to  consider  steps  to  regulate
toxic substances that can harm our children and our communities.

The  Government  Accountability  Office’s  recent  report  on  IRIS  concluded  that
EPA’s  process  for  initiating  and  completing  IRIS  assessments  resulted  in  proposals
that  are  in  preparation  for  more  than  five  years,  with  some  assessments  taking
more  than  a  decade.  The  new  process  that  EPA  and  OMB  instituted  just  this  past
April will add additional years to IRIS assessments.

The years of added study and discussion regarding IRIS assessments come on top
of a regulatory process that is burdened with very time consuming steps for a com-
plete  risk  assessment,  cost-benefit  analyses,  and  internal  and  external  reviews  as
laid  down  in  Executive  Orders  and  statute.  Even  after  a  regulation  is  finalized,  it
can  be  challenged  in  court  and  sent  back  to  the  Agency  for  revision.  When  finally
established  a  new  regulation  usually  includes  some  time,  often  many  years,  for  the
affected parties to ‘‘transition’’ away from the practices that are being regulated.

During  this  entire  process,  exposures  continue,  toxic  substances  remain  unregu-
lated  or  under-regulated  in  commerce,  and  contamination  is  not  cleaned  up  or  not
cleaned up to a level that we think is actually safe.

Today  we  will  hear  from  people  who  have  lived,  and  ore  living  with,  these  con-
sequences. These people will describe what their families and communities have en-
dured  for  years—situations  that  no  one  would  wish  to  experience  for  even  one  day.
While the failures of the IRIS database are not responsible for these experiences,
the  gaps  in  IRIS,  and  the  improper  intrusion  of  politics  into  database  entries  have
likely  contributed  to  the  situations  that  these  people  and  their  communities  have
had to deal with. When State and local authorities get poor information, or no infor-
mation,  from  IRIS  regarding  the  health  hazards  of  a  particular  pollutant,  their  re-

sponse to pollution in a community is likely to be confused and confusing. When citi-
zens  can’t  turn  to  IRIS  for  information—and  the  database  gets  20,000  web  hits  a
year—then it is hard for them to know what they are fighting for in terms of clean-
ups and health risks.

The worst thing about these families’ experiences is that they are likely to be re-
peated  because  exposures  to  the  chemical  that  led  to  their  problems  continue.  Tri-
chloroethylene or TCE was discovered in the early 1900s and has been on the mar-
ket and widely used since the 1920s as a degreaser. Discovery of its toxic properties
eliminated its use as an analgesic in the 1930s and by the 1970s evidence in animal
experiments indicated it might cause cancer. It is one of the most frequently occur-
ring  contaminants  in  Superfund  sites  and  it  is  present  in  air,  drinking  water,  and
soils.

EPA  has  been  working  on  a  revised  TCE  assessment  since  1989.  Two  years  ago,
following interventions by NASA, the Department of Energy, the Department of De-
fense  and  OMB,  the  National  Academy  reviewed  EPA’s  draft  IRIS  assessment  and
the science available on TCE and said that: ‘‘evidence on carcinogenic risk and other
health hazards from exposure to trichloroethylene has strengthened since 2001 . . ..
Priority  should  be  given  to  finalizing  the  risk  assessment  so  that  risk  management
decisions can be made expeditiously.’’

Expeditiously?  Expeditious  is  not  a  word  that  describes  this  situation.  GAO  esti-
mates that EPA will not complete their TCE assessment until 2010—that’s twenty-
one years from their original start date.

If  they  complete  the  assessment  in  2010,  we  will  still  be  years  away  from  regu-
latory action. People will have been exposed to a known toxic substance for decades,
for  a  generation,  while  the  government  engages  in  study  after  study.  Have  we  be-
come  so  obsessed  with  getting  the  science  right  that  we  have  lost  sight  of  our  real
goal  protecting  public  health?  Or,  is  getting  the  science  right  a  pretext  for  obstruc-
tion?

This  system  defies  common  sense.  It  is  broken,  and  it  is  condemning  people  to

future health problems.

I  now  yield  to  my  distinguished  colleague,  the  Ranking  Member  of  the  Sub-

committee, Representative Sensenbrenner for an opening statement.

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  Be-
fore making my statement, let me say that Dr. David Hoel, who is
the  Minority  witness  at  today’s  hearing,  got  stuck  in  the  Atlanta
airport  last  night  because  of  bad  weather.  We  kind  of  know  about
that  the  last  couple  of  weeks  in  Wisconsin  where  I  come  from.  I
would  like  to  ask  unanimous  consent  that  Dr.  Hoel’s  testimony  be
placed  in  the  record,  and  that  he  be  instructed  to  respond  to  cer-
tain  written  questions  by  Members  of  the  Committee  and  their
staff, and that the responses to those questions also be placed into
the record.

Chairman MILLER. Without objection, that is so ordered.
[The  statement  of  Mr.  Hoel  appears  in  Appendix:  Additional  Ma-

terial for the Record.]

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Integrated  Risk  Infor-
mation System, IRIS, process was originally developed for a specific
task. Different offices throughout the EPA were relying on different
assessments  of  the  health  effects  of  chronic  exposure  to  toxic
chemicals. IRIS was intended to establish a uniform database with-
in the EPA.

However,  over  time,  IRIS  has  become  an  authoritative  resource
on chemical toxicity. Other agencies, states, the international com-
munity, and the industries have been becoming increasingly reliant
on  IRIS  and  the  assessments  took  on  increased  importance.  These
outside  groups  have  sought  to  impact  a  process  that  was  not  ini-
tially  designed  to  handle  external  pressures.  The  result  has  been
an IRIS process that has effectively broken down.

The GAO recently issued a scathing condemnation of the current
state  of  the  IRIS  program.  The  report  is  titled  ‘‘Low  Productivity

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 22:03 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042370 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O08\052108\42370A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

125

and  New  Interagency  Review  Process  Limit  the  Usefulness  and
Credibility  of  EPA’s  Integrated  Risk  Information  System.’’  Now,
that is a mouthful, but I think it says where we are at now. In my
opinion, it accurately sums up the GAO’s findings. But IRIS’ actual
production  numbers  are  even  worse.  EPA  currently  has  a  backlog
of 70 ongoing assessments, and has managed to complete only two
assessments  in  each  of  the  last  two  years.  Talk  about  a  snail’s
pace.  At  the  current  pace,  it  will  take  35  years  for  the  EPA  to  fin-
ish its current backlog, and that is assuming it takes on no further
tasks.

The  EPA  has  attempted  to  develop  uniform  process  for  IRIS  as-
sessments. The Agency argues that it can expedite the IRIS process
by involving other agencies earlier in the process. While preventing
last-minute  delays  is  an  important  reform,  the  ability  of  other
agencies to extend the timeframe of assessments should be sharply
limited.  Data  gaps  in  risk  assessments  will  always  exist  as  better
science  is  always  developing.  EPA  needs  to  limit  the  timeframe  of
assessments  to  prevent  other  agencies  from  indefinitely  delaying
the process.

EPA  must  also  balance  its  need  to  complete  assessments  with
the  rights  of  interested  parties  to  comment.  The  best  way  to
achieve  this  balance  would  be  to  give  more  notice  of  its  assess-
ments.  The  EPA  already  publishes  an  annual  agenda  of  the  chem-
ical  it  intends  to  assess  in  the  Federal  Register.  If  the  EPA  moves
the  date  of  that  publication  forward,  thus  providing  more  notice,
the  interested  parties  will  have  a  longer  period  to  comment  on
what they deem to be insufficiencies in the scientific record. During
this  comment  period,  EPA  can  focus  on  its  backlog.  Because  it  of-
fered  a  comment  period,  EPA  can  then  fairly  limit  the  ability  of
outside  parties  to  delay  assessments  once  they  are  underway.  The
result  would  be  a  more  efficient  process  that  preserves  taxpayers’
money  and  promotes  public  health.  In  my  opinion,  that  is  a  win-
win.

I  urge  the  EPA  to  consider  these  proposals,  because  IRIS  must
be  fixed.  In  April,  this  subcommittee  held  a  hearing  on  formalde-
hyde levels in trailers provided to the victims of Hurricane Katrina.
In  that  hearing,  we  investigated  how  the  Agency  for  Toxic  Sub-
stances  and  Disease  Registry  struggled  to  identify  the  proper  level
of  concern  for  long-term  exposure  to  formaldehyde.  EPA  deter-
mined  its  formaldehyde  assessment  was  outdated  in  1997,  but  11
years later, the assessment is still incomplete. These hurricane vic-
tims are the real world result of EPA’s bureaucratic failures.

I yield back the balance of my time.

The  Government  Accountability  Office  (GAO)  recently  issued  a  scathing  con-
demnation of the current state of the IRIS program. The report’s title, Low Produc-
tivity  and  New  Interagency  Review  Process  Limit  the  Usefulness  and  Credibility  of
EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System, accurately sums up GAO’s findings. But
IRIS’ actual production numbers are worse. EPA currently has a backlog of 70 ongo-
ing assessments and has managed to complete only two assessments in each of the
last  two  years.  At  the  current  pace,  it  will  take  35  years  for  EPA  to  finish  its  cur-
rent backlog.

EPA has attempted to develop a uniform process for IRIS assessments. The agen-
cy  argues  that  it  can  expedite  the  IRIS  process  by  involving  other  agencies  earlier
in the process. While preventing last minute delays is an important reform, the abil-
ity of other agencies to extend the timeframe of assessments should be sharply lim-
ited. Data gaps in risk assessments will always exist as better science is always de-
veloping. EPA needs to limit the timeframe of assessments to prevent other agencies
from indefinitely delaying the process.

EPA must balance its need to complete assessments with the rights of interested
parties to comment. The best way to achieve this balance would be to give more no-
tice  of  its  assessments.  EPA  already  publishes  an  annual  agenda  of  the  chemical
it  intends  to  assess  in  the  Federal  Register.  If  EPA  moves  the  date  of  that  publica-
tion  forward,  providing  more  notice,  interested  parties  will  have  a  longer  period  to
comment  on  what  they  deem  to  be  insufficiencies  in  the  scientific  record.  During
this  comment  period,  EPA  can  focus  on  its  backlog.  Because  it  offered  a  comment
period, EPA can then fairly limit the ability of outside parties to delay assessments
once they are underway. The result would be a more efficient process that preserves
taxpayers’ money and promotes public health.

I urge EPA to consider these proposals, because IRIS must be fixed. In April, this
subcommittee held a hearing on formaldehyde levels in trailers provided to the vic-
tims  of  Hurricane  Katrina.  In  that  hearing,  we  investigated  how  the  Agency  for
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry struggled to identify the proper ‘‘level of con-
cern’’ for long-term exposure to formaldehyde. EPA determined its formaldehyde as-
sessment  was  outdated  in  1997,  but  eleven  years  later,  that  assessment  is  still  in-
complete.  These  hurricane  victims  are  the  real  world  result  of  EPA’s  bureaucratic
failures.

Chairman  MILLER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Sensenbrenner.  Mr.  Sensen-
brenner  spoke  of  the  backlog  and  said  that  there  was  no  further
work  for  EPA  to  do,  and  an  IRIS  list  that  would  take  35  years.
Since 600 new chemicals enter the marketplace a year, it is reason-
able to assume that there will be more for EPA to do.

I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  enter  documents  for  the  record  that
had  been  provided  to  the  minority.  Without  objection,  it  is  so  or-
dered.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  This  is  the  second  hearing  in  one  month  on  the  Inte-

grated Risk Information System within the Environmental Protection Agency.

This system is intended to protect both environmental quality and human health

through effective regulations and other policy implementation.

However, today’s witnesses will make clear that environmental contamination has

impacted their lives in the most severe ways.

It is my hope that this subcommittee can learn what influence the current Admin-
istration  has  had  on  IRIS,  and  how  IRIS’  functions  have  changed  since  the  com-
mencement of the current Administration.

Some  of  the  problems  with  that  process  were  the  subject  of  this  subcommittee’s

hearing two weeks ago.

Oversights as glaring and irresponsible have major consequences.
Today,  we  will  hear  true  stories  from  Americans  whose  lives  are  forever  changed

as a result of needless, reckless pollution.

It  is  our  duty  to  hear  them,  and  to  work  out  policies  to  prevent  tragedies  of  this

nature from ever occurring.

This subcommittee is aware that within the IRIS system, only four chemical list-

ings have been finalized in the past two years.

While  approximately  700  new  chemicals  enter  commerce  each  year,  and  more
than 80,000 chemicals reported under the Toxic Substances Control Act, it is beyond
my  comprehension  that  the  E.P.A.  is  taking  no  action  to  inform  the  public  on  the
health risks of no more than four chemicals.

This  subcommittee  seeks  to  closely  evaluate  the  work—or  lack  thereof—of  the

E.P.A. when it comes to chemical toxicity and public health.

My condolences go to Ms. Holt-Orsted and Mr. Ensminger, who have seen loss of

life as a result of environmental contamination.

My  own  constituents,  in  Dallas,  have  struggled  with  lead  contamination  in  the

past, and they continue to deal with long-term health effects.

This issue of the politicization of science—particularly environmental protection—

is of gravest concern to me.

Congress  is  right  to  provide  vigorous  oversight  in  situations  where  the  Federal

Government may be guilty of failing its citizens in such an egregious manner.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman  MILLER.  And  now,  it  is  my  pleasure  to  introduce  our
witnesses  today.  The  first  is  a  North  Carolinian—at  least,  an
adopted  North  Carolinian,  Mr.  Jerome  Ensminger,  retired  Master
Sergeant  with  United  States  Marine  Corps.  Second,  Mr.  Lenny
Siegel,  Executive  Director  of  the  Center  for  Public  Environmental
Oversight;  and  Dr.  Linda  Greer  is  the  Director  of  the  Natural  Re-
sources Defense Council’s Health Program.

You  will  have  five  minutes  for  your  spoken  testimony,  and  your
written  testimony  will  be  included  in  the  record  for  the  hearing.
When you have completed your testimony, we will begin with ques-
tions.  Each  Member  will  have  five  minutes  to  question  the  panel.
It  is  the  practice  of  the  Subcommittee  to  take  testimony  under
oath.  Do  any  of  you  have  any  objection  to  being  sworn  in?  The
Committee  also  provides  that  you  may  be  represented  by  counsel.
Are you represented by counsel at today’s hearing?

If you now would please stand and raise your right hand? Do you
swear  to  tell  the  truth  and  nothing  but  the  truth?  All  of  the  wit-
nesses have responded in the affirmative.

Mr. Ensminger, you may begin.

STATEMENT OF MR. JEROME M. ENSMINGER, MASTER

SERGEANT, U.S. MARINE CORPS (RET.)

Master  Sergeant  ENSMINGER.  Good  morning.  My  name  is  Jerry
Ensminger,  and  I  served  my  country  faithfully  for  more  than  24
years  in  the  United  States  Marine  Corp.  I  would  like  to  thank  the
Chairman,  the  Committee  Members,  and  their  staff  for  all  of  the
hard  work  that  went  into  making  these  hearing  possible.  I  must
say that since 3 January 2007, I have been heartened and inspired
by  the  oversight  activities  by  this  Congress.  You  have  been  taking
on the important issues that matter to the majority of our citizens,
not just the issues that reflect the benefit of special-interest groups
and  big  business.  I  am  appearing  here  today  as  a  tragic  example
of  the  consequences  of  a  system  that  ignores  our  environment  and
the inevitable health effects that result from it.

Marine  Corp  Base  Camp  Lejeune,  North  Carolina  is  quite  pos-
sibly  one  of,  if  not  the  worst,  water-contamination  incidents  in
modern  world  history.  The  Agency  for  Toxic  Substances  and  Dis-
ease  Registry,  or  ATSDR,  estimates  that  between  750,000  and  one
million people were potentially exposed to horrendous levels of tox-
ins through their drinking water while stationed at Camp Lejeune.
My  daughter  Janey  was  conceived  while  her  mother  and  I  lived  in
one of the base-family housing areas where the drinking water was
affected by the contamination at the base. Just like our other chil-
dren,  Janey  was  born  seemingly  normal.  That  is  until  she  was  di-
agnosed with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, ALL, at the age of six.
In  1997,  the  ATSDR  proposed  a  childhood  leukemia  and  non-
Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  study  for  Camp  Lejeune  children  who  had
been  exposed  to  volatile  organic  chemicals,  or  VOCs,  cleaning  sol-
vents,  in  utero,  while  their  parents  lived  at  the  base,  between  the
years  of  1968  through  1985.  The  protocol  and  proposal  for  this

study outlines that the expected occurrences of the target illnesses
in  a  cohort  of  10,000  to  12,000  births  for  that  time  period  would
be  7.2  cases.  The  ATSDR  has  confirmed  14  cases  of  leukemia  and
two cases of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. This more than 100-percent
increase in the incidence of these childhood cancers.

Mr. Chairman, let me lay out some of the facts and figures relat-
ing to the Camp Lejeune water-contamination situation. The docu-
mented  levels  of  contaminants  in  the  finished  drinking  water,  at
the  tap,  were  some  280  times  higher  than  what  is  considered  safe
for  these  very  same  chemicals.  The  Navy  Bureau  of  Medicine  and
Surgery  issued  strict  regulations  in  their  BUMED  instructions
6240.3(b), in 1963, governing potable water-distribution systems on
Naval Shore Facilities. Included in these regulations were preemp-
tive  measures  to  ensure  that  existing  and  future  water  supplies
were  not  contaminated  by  extraneous  sources.  The  Camp  Lejeune
family-area water-supply wells were located on the virtual property
line, down gradient, and directly across the street from potential ci-
vilian  contamination  sources,  gasoline  stations,  auto-repair  facili-
ties, dry-cleaning establishments, and known septic systems.

In  1971,  the  Naval  Facilities  Engineering  Command  from  Nor-
folk,  Virginia,  came  to  Camp  Lejeune  and  selected  multiple  sites
for  new  drinking-water  supply  wells.  One  of  these  new  wells  was
HP–651,  which  began  producing  well  water  for  the  Camp  Lejeune
Point  Water  Distribution  Plan  in  January  of  1972.  The  site  which
had been selected by the Navy engineers for the placement of HP–
651  was  at  the  back  corner  of  the  base  disposal  yard,  the  junk
yard.  The  disposal  yard  had  been  in  operation  for  decades  by  the
time  they  selected  for  a  water-supply  well.  In  February  of  1985,
HP–651 tested positive for some 26,000 parts-per-billion of volatile
organic chemicals. There is little doubt that this water-supply well
was  contaminated  immediately  upon  or  shortly  after  its  construc-
tion.

The irony of all of this is the fact that many of the human expo-
sures  that  took  place  at  Camp  Lejeune  would  have  been  avoided,
had Navy and Marine Corp officials followed their own regulations.
The  most  audacious  and  blasphemous  truth  to  this  entire  water-
contamination incident at Camp Lejeune is the fact that Navy and
Marine  Corp  officials  knew  of  the  existence  of  this  contamination
in  their  drinking  water  for  five  years  before  they  took  any  action
to rectify the problem. Navy and Marine Corp officials were know-
ingly  poisoning  their  own  people.  That  is  correct.  All  of  this  was
known  and  taking  place  behind  the  scenes  at  the  very  same  time
that my daughter, Janey, was suffering through her fight with leu-
kemia, and they said absolutely nothing.

Not only did they say nothing, they went as far as to return two
of  the  three  contaminated  wells  for  the  Tarawa  Terrace  Housing
Area  back  online  for  two  more  years.  They  had  the  opportunity  of
tapping  into  the  local  community  water  lines,  which  were  located
just  a  few  feet  from  the  property  line.  Instead,  Navy  and  Marine
Corp  officials  opted  against  this  idea  because  they  did  not  want  to
owe the local government any reciprocating favors.

Since  the  ATSDR  entered  the  gates  of  Camp  Lejeune  to  execute
their Congressionally mandated mission, representatives of the De-
partment of the Navy have done all they could to obstruct their ef-

forts. I can make this statement with confidence, because I possess
the  documentation  to  back  it  up.  As  recently  as  the  week  before
last,  DOD  and  Department  of  the  Navy  officials  were  threatening
to  thwart  the  ATSDR  initiatives  at  Camp  Lejeune  by  withholding
the funding.

I  spoke  earlier  about  my  daughter  Janey.  My  daughter  Janey—
and  I  do  not  know  if  anybody  else  in  this  room  ever  had  a  child
that  was  diagnosed  with  a  catastrophic  illness,  but  I  can  assure
you,  when  Janey  was  diagnosed,  and  they  told  me  that  she  had
leukemia, it took me to my very knees, in the hallway at the Naval
hospital  at  Camp  Lejeune.  And  my  forehead  went  down  on  the
deck, and I broke out in a sweat, and I could not move. Janey went
through  hell,  and  all  of  us  that  loved  her  went  through  hell  with
her. A six-year-old child, naturally, they have had their normal in-
oculations;  but  a  child  with  leukemia  is  poked  and  prodded.  You
just  cannot  believe  what  they  go  through.  I  held  my  daughter  in
the  treatment  rooms  when  they  took  needles  and  broke  through
her  hip  to  extract  bone  marrow  to  test,  and  she  screamed  in  my
ear,  ‘‘Daddy,  Daddy  do  not  let  them  hurt  me.’’  And  the  only  re-
sponse that I could give her was, ‘‘Janey, the only reason I am let-
ting them hurt you is because they have to hurt you. They are try-
ing to help you.’’

When  she  got  hit  with  chemotherapy,  I  would  make  it  a  few
miles  down  the  road,  and  she  would  get  so  sick,  I  would  have  to
stop, and pull over, and hold her and rub her back while she threw
her guts up, wishing that I could take that off of my child and put
it on myself, but God would not do it.

Throughout Janey’s treatment, when she was allowed to go back
to  school,  her  treatments  made  her  look  like  a  freak.  She  lost  her
hair.  She  gained  more  than  30  pounds  at  a  time  when  she  was  on
steroids.  Her  schoolmates  would  pick  on  her  and  call  her  Cabbage
Patch Kid. She would come home from school crying. I do not know
how  many  times  I  had  to  take  Janey  in  the  evenings  and  just  go
out  to  the  beach  and  walk  to  try  to  make  sense  out  of  what  was
happening to her.

At Duke University Medical Center where Janey died, and where
Janey was receiving a lot of her treatments, in the pediatric ward,
the  majority  of  the  rooms  up  there  have  soft  walls.  They  fold.
There’s  two  rooms  at  the  corners,  directly  across  from  the  nurses’
station  that  have  two  solid  walls.  They  are  referred  to  by  the  par-
ents  as  the  dying  rooms,  and  the  closer  your  child  comes  to  dying,
the  closer  you  are  to  those  two  rooms.  When  you  get  moved  into
one  of  them,  you  know  you  are  next.  It  is  like  watching  mortar
rounds walking towards your bunker.

Nights in the hospital, I spend countless nights in a cot that fold-
ed  down  from  the  wall.  And  you  lay  in  that  hospital  all  hours  of
the  night,  listening  to  the  kids  that  they  got  in  the  treatment
rooms screaming bloody murder. I never cried in front of Janey the
whole time she was being treated, which was nearly two-and-a-half
years. That morning, that day, I started crying, and she looked up
at me, and she had pneumonia, and she could hardly talk. And she
looked at me, and she said, ‘‘Stop it.’’ And I said, ‘‘Stop what?’’ And
she  said,  ‘‘Stop  crying,  Daddy.’’  She  said,  ‘‘I  love  you.’’  And  I  said,
‘‘Janey,  I  know  that.’’  I  said,  ‘‘I  love  you.’’  And  she  said,  ‘‘I  know.’’

Those were the last words my daughter spoke to me. She went into
a coma. Thirty-five minutes later, she was dead.

Janey is dead now. Nothing is going to bring her back. But there
were  people  who  were  exposed  at  Camp  Lejeune,  adults,  the  sib-
lings  of  these  in  utero  children,  that  are  just  now  reaching  the  la-
tency  period  for  their  exposures.  They  are,  right  now,  developing
cancers,  adult  leukemia,  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphomas,  male  breast
cancers—six cases of it that we found—renal failures. Those people
need help. We do not need any more delays from DOD and the De-
partment of the Navy and the United States Marine Corp.

It is a known fact that the United States Department of Defense
is our nation’s largest polluter. It is beyond my comprehension why
an entity with that type of reputation and who has a vested inter-
est in seeing little to no environmental oversight would be included
in the scientific process. Not only are they obstructing science, they
are  also  jeopardizing  the  public  health  for  millions  of  people  all
around  the  world.  It  is  quite  obvious  by  their  activities  to  thwart
science  that  they  have  something  to  fear.  What  they  fear  is  that
past negligence and the liability that comes along with it. There is
little wonder why DOD has been seeking immunities from environ-
mental  regulations  for  the  last  seven  years  running,  and  yet  this
Administration  and  past  Congresses  have  allowed  DOD’s  tentacles
to infiltrate the realm of science.

We all need to just back off a little bit and allow science to speak
for  itself  and  let  the  chips  fall  where  they  may.  Thank  you,  Mr.
Chairman.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Ensminger follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF JEROME M. ENSMINGER

Good  morning,  my  name  is  Jerry  Ensminger  and  I  served  my  country  faithfully
for  more  than  24  years  in  the  United  States  Marine  Corps.  I  would  like  to  thank
the  Chairman,  the  Committee  Members  and  their  staffs  for  all  of  the  hard  work
that  went  into  making  these  hearings  possible.  I  must  say  that  since  3  January
2007,  I  have  been  heartened  and  inspired  by  the  oversight  activities  of  this  Con-
gress.  You  have  been  taking  on  the  important  issues  that  matter  to  the  majority
of our citizens, not just the issues that affect/benefit special interest groups and big
business!

I  am  appearing  here  today  as  a  tragic  example  of  the  consequences  of  a  system
that  ignores  our  environment  and  the  inevitable  health  effects  that  result  from  it.
Marine  Corps  Base,  Camp  Lejeune,  North  Carolina  is  quite  possibly  one  of,  if  not
the  worst  drinking  water  contamination  incidents  in  modern  world  history!  The
Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) estimates that between
750,000 and 1,000,000 people were potentially exposed to horrendous levels of toxins
through their drinking water while stationed at Camp Lejeune.

My daughter Janey was conceived while her mother and I lived in one of the base
family  housing  areas  where  the  drinking  water  was  affected  by  the  contamination
at  the  base.  Just  like  our  other  children,  Janey  was  born  seemingly  normal,  that
is  until  she  was  diagnosed  with  Acute  Lymphosytic  Leukemia  (A.L.L.)  at  the  age
of six. In 1997, the ATSDR proposed a childhood leukemia/non-Hodgkins lymphoma
study for Camp Lejeune children who had been exposed to Volatile Organic Chemi-
cals  (V.O.C.’s,  cleaning  solvents!)  in  utero  while  their  parents  lived  at  the  base  be-
tween  the  years  of  1968–1985.  (Note:  The  start  date  of  this  study  was  based  upon
the  beginning  date  for  the  computerization  of  birth  records  in  North  Carolina,  not
on  potential  exposure.)  The  protocol/proposal  for  this  study  outlined  that  the  ex-
pected  occurrences  of  the  targeted  illnesses  in  a  cohort  of  10,000–12,000  births  for
that time period would be 7.2 cases. The ATSDR has confirmed 14 cases of leukemia
and two cases of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, this is more than a 100 percent increase
in the incidence of these childhood cancers!

Mr.  Chairman,  let  me  layout  some  of  the  facts  and  figures  relating  to  the  Camp
Lejeune  water  contamination  situation.  The  documented  levels  of  contaminates  in

the  finished  drinking  water  (at  the  tap)  were  some  280  times  higher  than  what  is
currently considered safe for these very same chemicals! The Navy Bureau of Medi-
cine  and  Surgery  issued  strict  regulations  (BUMED  INST  6240.3B  [CLW  0144])  in
1963  governing  potable  water  distribution  systems  on  Naval  Shore  Facilities.  In-
cluded  in  these  regulations  were  preemptive  measures  to  ensure  that  existing  and
future water supplies were not contaminated by extraneous sources.

The Camp Lejeune, Tarawa Terrace family housing area water supply wells were
located  on  the  virtual  property  line,  down  gradient,  and  directly  across  the  street
from  multiple  potential  civilian  contamination  sources!  (Gasoline  stations,  auto  re-
pair facilities, dry cleaning establishments, and known septic systems.) In 1971, the
Naval  Facilities  Engineering  Command  from  Norfolk,  Va.  came  to  Camp  Lejeune
and  selected  multiple  sites  for  the  construction  of  new  drinking  water  supply  wells
for the base.

One  of  these  new  wells  was  HP–651,  which  began  producing  raw  water  for  the
Camp  Lejeune  Hadnot  Point  water  distribution  plant  in  January  of  1972.  The  site
which  had  been  selected  by  the  Navy  engineers  for  the  placement  of  HP–651  was
at  the  back  corner  of  the  base  disposal  yard!  (junk  yard!)  The  disposal  yard  had
been in operation for decades by the time this site was selected for a drinking water
supply well. In February 1985, HP–651 tested positive for some 26,000 ppb of Vola-
tile Organic Chemicals (CLW 5260)! There is little doubt that this water supply well
was  contaminated  immediately  upon,  or  very  shortly  after  its  construction!  (Note:
The  ATSDR’s  on-going  water  modeling  for  the  Camp  Lejeune,  Hadnot  Point  and
Holcomb  Blvd.  water  systems  will  verify  this  fact  once  it  is  completed.)  The  irony
of  all  this  is  the  fact  that  many  of  the  human  exposures  that  took  place  at  Camp
Lejeune  would  have  been  avoided  had  Navy  and  Marine  Corps  officials  followed
their own regulations!

The most audacious and blasphemous truth in this entire water contamination in-
cident  at  Camp  Lejeune  is  the  fact  that  Navy  and  Marine  Corps  officials  knew  of
the  existence  of  this  contamination  in  the  drinking  water  for  five  years  before  they
took  any  action  to  rectify  the  problem  (CLW  0430–0432,  0436,  0438,  0441,  0443,
0592,  0593)!  (Navy  and  Marine  Corps  officials  were  knowingly  poisoning  their  own
people!)  That  is  correct,  all  of  this  was  known  and  taking  place  behind  the  scenes
at the very same time that my daughter Janey was suffering through her fight with
leukemia and they said absolutely nothing! Not only did they say nothing, they went
as far as to return two of the three known contaminated wells for the Tarawa Ter-
race  housing  area  back  on-line  for  two  more  years!  They  had  the  option  of  tapping

property  line.  Instead,  Navy  and  Marine  Corps  officials  opted  against  this  idea  be-
cause  they  didn’t  want  to  owe  any  reciprocating  favors  to  the  local  community  gov-
ernment! (CLW 1129–1131)

Since  the  ATSDR  entered  the  gates  of  Camp  Lejeune  to  execute  their  Congres-
sionally-mandated  mission,  representatives  of  the  Department  of  the  Navy  (DON)
have  done  all  they  could  to  obstruct  their  efforts.  I  can  make  this  statement  with
confidence  because  I  possess  the  documentation  to  back  it  up!  As  recently  as  the
week  before  last,  DOD  and  DON  officials  were  threatening  to  thwart  the  ATSDR’s
initiatives  at  Camp  Lejeune  by  withholding  funding!  (CLW  2407,  0000,  0000  (A),
2995, 2999, 3243, 3307, 4925, 4926)

It  is  a  known  fact  that  the  United  States  Department  of  Defense  is  our  nation’s

Chairman.  MILLER.  Mr.  Ensminger,  I  know  that  Mr.  Sensen-
brenner  joins  me  in  extending  our  condolences  for  the  loss  of  your
daughter and all that you and your family have gone through.

Mr. Siegel.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  LENNY  SIEGEL,  EXECUTIVE  DIRECTOR,
THE  CENTER  FOR  PUBLIC  ENVIRONMENTAL  OVERSIGHT
(CPEO)
Mr.  SIEGEL.  Good  morning.  I  am  from  the  town  of  Mountain
View, California. We have about seven or eight Superfund sites and
numerous  other  contamination  sites.  I  work  with  communities  all
over  the  country.  I  visit  communities,  folks  from  Camp  Lejeune,
and lots of places, and I hear lots of stories like Jerry’s.

The  Environmental  Protection  Agency’s  integrated  risk  informa-
tion system is the foundation of most of the federal, State, and trib-
al  risk-management  decisions  that  determine  the  safety  of  the  air
that  we  breathe,  the  water  we  drink  and  the  soil  under  our  feet.
Quantitative  judgments  embedded  in  IRIS  may  read  like  a  foreign
language or quantum physics to most Americans. People do not un-
derstand  it.  But  those  judgments  affect  our  health,  our  environ-
ment, and our property.

Unfortunately, over the past several years, the White House and
federal agencies that are among the world’s greatest polluters, De-
partment  of  Energy,  Department  of  Defense,  and  NASA,  have  es-
sentially  hijacked  EPA’s  authority  to  conduct  human  health-risk
assessments.  EPA’s  announcement  in  April  of  the  new  process  for
IRIS  simply  institutionalizes  an  approach  that  has  been  used,  at
least  for  perchlorate  and  trichloroethylene.  This  is  an  approach
that  unnecessarily  puts  Americans  at  risk.  In  lay  terms,  the  fox  is
now managing the hen house.

In  my  prepared  testimony,  I  tell  the  story  of  trichloroethylene.  I
could  tell  perchlorate  because  I  have  worked  on  that  as  well.  Fed-
eral agencies have delayed and perhaps prevented, in the long run,
the  establishment  of  more  protective  health  standards  for  TCE.
The  process  they  use  for  that  is  apparently  the  precedent  for  the
new IRIS process that EPA announced in April.

In  2001,  EPA  issued  a  draft  human  health-risk  assessment  for
TCE.  Though  its  Science  Advisory  Board  generally  endorsed  the
study, EPA, under pressure from the White House and federal pol-
luting agencies, withdrew its 2001 findings, and it turned the issue
of  TCE  toxicity  over  to  what  was  called  the  interagency  working
group,  and  that  working  group  sent  it  to  the  National  Academy  of
Sciences for re-review.

In early 2003, January 2003, EPA scientists came to my commu-
nity of Mountain View to discuss the migration of TCE vapors into
homes and businesses at, at least, four contamination sites. One of
them  was  not  Superfund.  The  others  were  Superfund.  Over  400
people attended that meeting. The picture is up there.

EPA  told  us  that,  based  on  the  2001  risk  assessment,  that  TCE
was five to 65 times as toxic as previously believed. I learned about
a  year  later  from  a  friend  in  the  Navy  that  that  provisional  risk
assessment  would  never  be  implemented,  that  the  EPA  was  going
to withdraw it and go through the process I just mentioned.

They  weakened  the  standards,  and  those  weakened  standards
have  led  to  less  protection  for  the  people  in  my  community  and
communities  throughout  the  country,  even  though,  as  Chairman
Miller read, the Academy of Science’s review committee found that
the  evidence  that  TCE  caused  cancer  was  even  stronger  than  EPA
believed in 2001. Still, EPA has really done almost nothing to move
forward to establish new standards for TCE.

The key point of my testimony is that these numbers in IRIS ac-
tually make a difference in people’s lives and their health and what
happens  to  their  property.  This  is  a  picture  of  my  friend  Jane’s
house, about a half-mile from my house.

She  lives  across  the  street  from  the  birthplace  of  the  semicon-
ductor industry, and they originally thought that the plume bound-
ary  from  TCE  was  in  the  middle  of  the  street  in  front  her  house.
It  turns  out  the  plume  goes  under  her  house,  because  when  they
tested  her  son’s  bedroom,  they  found  0.8  micrograms  per  cubic
meter of TCE in the air. According to the initial standard that the
EPA  science  brought  based  on  the  2001  health-risk  assessment,
that  was  almost  two  orders  of  magnitude  higher  than  what  the
standard should be, what was considered a legally safe cancer risk.
With the standard that was in place before the 2001 health-risk as-
sessment, he was considered safe, so it made it a difference.

Now,  fortunately,  and  it  is  really  not  fortunate  at  all,  but  the
measurements  in  the  basement  of  the  house  were  higher,  and  so
they  installed  a  fan  to  ventilate  the  house  and  lower  the  contami-
nation. After age 11, her son’s exposures went down because we did
something  about  it.  We  do  not  know  whether  he  will  get  sick  as  a
result.  Jane  does  know  that  she  is  going  to  have  a  lot  of  trouble
selling her house because it has the mitigation system there.

This  is  a  picture  of  where  Shirley  lived  in  Bayport,  Minnesota.

She had contamination in her private drinking water supply, be-
tween the five parts per billion, which is the longstanding standard
for  TCE  in  drinking  water,  and  one  which  is  where  everybody  ex-
pected the number to go if the 2001 human health-risk assessment
had  been  implemented.  Her  nephew  wrote  me.  Because  the  rule
was  for  this  Superfund  site  in  Bayport,  Minnesota  is  that  people
who  had  contamination  above  five  would  have  treatment  systems
on  their  private  wells.  She  did  not  get  it,  and  she  died  of  cancer
a  couple  of  years  ago.  And  her  son  asked  me,  you  know,  why  is  it
that  she  did  not  get  the  protection?  I  cannot  say.  I  am  not  a  sci-
entist,  and  I  am  not  sure  scientists  can  tell  you  she  got  sick  be-
cause  of  that  exposure  or  to  what  degree  it  added  to  the  risk  she
faced,  because  we  drink  this  stuff,  breathe  this  stuff  all  over  the
place.  But  I  do  know  that  that  number  made  a  difference  as  to
whether  her  water  was  treated  for  the  trichloroethylene  that  she
was drinking and was showering in and was being exposed to.

The  numbers  also  make  a  difference  to  these  polluting  agencies.
We  found  on  the  Web  an  Air  Force  presentation  a  few  years  back,
around the time that this was all happening, that figured out that
it  would  cost  the  Department  of  Defense  $5  billion  extra  to  clean
up TCE if the standard went from five parts per billion to one part
per  billion  for  drinking  water.  I  do  not  know  if  that  is  really  true.
There are reasons why it might not have been as high, but it might
have  been  higher.  The  point  is  that  the  Defense  Department’s  in-
terest  in  this  is  primarily  one  that  they  are  a  responsible  party,
rather than their mission is to protect human health and the envi-
ronment.

So the people that I work with, the people who are impacted, the
people  who  are  breathing  and  drinking  the  contamination  of  these

sites  are  calling  on  EPA  to  withdraw  the  revision  that  it  made  in
the  IRIS  process  in  April  because  they  are  basically  institutional-
izing something that has been putting people at risk already.

And  we  have  come  up  with  three  principles  that  we  think  the
IRIS  process  should  involve.  The  IRIS  process  is  not  the  entire
process, but it is the foundation of it. First, all stakeholders, includ-
ing the affected public, private polluters, federal polluting agencies,
including the Defense Department, should have the same access to
the  decision-making  process  for  the  assessment  of  hazardous  sub-
stances.  This  notion  of  a  deliberative  process  in  which  the  federal
polluters  meet  privately  with  EPA  to  design  the  studies  is  unac-
ceptable.

Secondly, federally funded risk-relevant research should be man-
aged  by  agencies  that  do  not  have  conflicts  of  interest.  What  hap-
pened  with  perchlorate  is  that  the  Defense  Department  sponsored
some research and did not like the results, so they sponsored more
research  to  disprove  it.  I’m  much  more  comfortable  when  the  Cen-
ters  for  Disease  Control  does  studies  because  they  are  not  encum-
bered by the conflict of interest.

The  third  one,  the  entire  process  of  assessing  hazardous  sub-
stances  should  be  carried  out  in  the  sunshine,  with  oversight  by
the public, the press, and by Congress. I’m not a toxicologist or an
epidemiologist.  I  assume  that  Members  of  this  committee  are  not,
the  same,  as  well.  We  are  not  in  a  position  to  determine  whether
it should be 1, 5, or 50 for TCE, but we are calling upon you.

This is the people who are living and breathing this stuff. We are
calling  upon  you  to  ensure  that  we  have  a  fair,  open,  and  timely
process  to  evaluate  not  only  the  chemicals  that  we  are  discussing
today, but the many more than impact our lives. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF LENNY SIEGEL

Getting  the  Fox  out  of  the  Henhouse:  Restoring  the  Integ-
rity  of  EPA’s  Process  for  Determining  the  Toxicity  of  In-
dustrial and Military Chemicals

Executive Summary

The  Environmental  Protection  Agency’s  Integrated  Risk  Information  System
(IRIS)  is  the  foundation  of  most  of  the  federal,  State,  and  tribal  risk  management
decisions  that  determine  the  safety  of  the  air  we  breathe,  the  water  we  drink,  and
soil  under  our  feet.  The  quantitative  judgments  embedded  in  IRIS  may  read  like  a
foreign language or quantum physics to most Americans, but they affect our health,
our environment, and our property.

Unfortunately, over the past several years, the White House and federal agencies
that are among the world’s greatest polluters have hijacked EPA’s authority to con-
duct  human  health  risk  assessments.  EPA’s  April  announcement  of  a  new  IRIS
process  simply  institutionalizes  an  approach—used  for  perchlorate  and  trichloro-
ethylene  (TCE)—that  unnecessarily  puts  Americans  at  risk.  In  lay  terms,  the  fox
is now managing the henhouse.

In  my  prepared  testimony  I  tell  the  story  of  trichloroethylene.  Federal  agencies
have  delayed  and  perhaps  prevented  the  establishment  of  more  protective  health
standards  for  TCE,  following  a  pattern  that  appears  to  be  a  precedent  for  the  new
IRIS process. In 2001 EPA issued a Draft Human Health Risk Assessment for TCE.
Though  its  Science  Advisory  Board  generally  endorsed  that  study,  EPA—under
pressure  from  the  White  House  and  federal  polluting  agencies—withdrew  the  2001
findings. It turned the issue of TCE toxicity over to the Interagency Working Group
and  sent  it  to  the  National  Academies  of  Sciences  for  re-review.  Meanwhile,  EPA
scientists  significantly  weakened  the  standards  they  were  using  to  guide  vapor  in-

trusion  investigations  in  my  community  of  Mountain  View,  California.  Though  in
July 2006 the Academies of Sciences told EPA and the other agencies to move quick-
ly to promulgate a TCE standard, EPA has done little.

EPA risk findings make a difference. It’s the difference between response and in-
action in the bedroom of Jane’s son in Mountain View, California. It’s the difference
between  water  treatment  and  inaction  in  Shirley’s  former  home  in  Bayport,  Min-
nesota.  According  to  an  Air  Force  scientist,  it’s  a  difference  of  $5  billion  in  the  cost
of groundwater treatment at 1400 Defense Department sites.

People impacted by TCE, perchlorate, and other toxic substances have called upon
EPA  to  withdraw  its  recent  IRIS  changes  and  instead  create  a  process  based  upon
the three following principles:

1. All  stakeholders,  including  the  affected  public,  private  polluters,  and  federal
polluting agencies, should have the same access to the decision-making proc-
ess for the assessment of hazardous substances.

2. Federally funded risk-relevant research should be managed by agencies that
do  not  have  conflicts  of  interest—that  is,  agencies  that  will  incur  significant
costs  or  encumbrances  associated  with  more  protective  health  and  environ-
mental standards should not control these research activities.

3. The  entire  process  of  assessing  hazardous  substances  should  be  carried  out
in  the  sunshine,  with  oversight  by  the  public,  the  press,  and  by  Congress.

The TCE Risk Assessment

The  Environmental  Protection  Agency’s  Integrated  Risk  Information  System
(IRIS)  is  the  foundation  of  most  of  the  federal,  State,  and  tribal  risk  management
decisions  that  determine  the  safety  of  the  air  we  breathe,  the  water  we  drink,  and
soil  under  our  feet.  The  quantitative  judgments  embedded  in  IRIS  may  read  like  a
foreign language or quantum physics to most Americans, but they affect our health,
our environment, and our property.

Unfortunately, over the past several years, the White House and federal agencies
that are among the world’s greatest polluters have hijacked EPA’s authority to con-
duct  human  health  risk  assessments.  EPA’s  April  announcement  of  a  new  IRIS
process  simply  institutionalizes  an  approach  that  unnecessarily  puts  Americans  at
risk. In lay terms, the fox is now managing the henhouse.

Today  I  am  going  to  tell  the  story  of  trichloroethylene  (TCE),  the  once-universal
solvent  that  is  one  of  the  most  common  contaminants  at  both  federal  and  private
hazardous  waste  sites  across  the  country.  Federal  agencies  have  delayed  and  per-
haps prevented the establishment of more protective health standards for TCE, fol-
lowing a pattern that appears to be a precedent for the new IRIS process.

In August 2001 EPA issued a Draft Human Health Risk Assessment for Trichloro-
ethylene.  In  considering  the  impact  of  the  compound  on  young  children,  as  well  as
cumulative  exposures,  it  found  that  TCE  was  much  more  toxic  than  previously  be-
lieved.  In  December  2002,  EPA’s  Science  Advisory  Board  peer  review  praised  the
‘‘ground-breaking’’ assessment, finding:

The Board advises the Agency to move ahead to revise and complete this impor-
tant assessment. The assessment addresses a chemical, trichloroethylene (TCE),
significant for being a nearly ubiquitous environmental contaminant in both air
and  water,  being  a  common  contaminant  at  Superfund  sites,  and  because  it  is
‘‘listed’’  in  many  federal  statutes  and  regulations.  The  draft  assessment  is  also
important  because  it  sets  new  precedents  for  risk  assessment  at  EPA.  We  be-
lieve  the  draft  assessment  is  a  good  starting  point  for  completing  the  risk  as-
sessment  of  TCE.  The  Panel  commends  the  Agency  for  its  effort  and  advises  it
to  proceed  to  revise  and  finalize  the  draft  assessment  as  quickly  as  it  can  ad-
dress the advice provided in this report.

Meanwhile,  in  November  2002,  EPA  issued  tables  along  with  its  Draft  Vapor  In-
trusion  Guidance.  Vapor  intrusion  is  the  migration  of  volatile  compounds  such  as
TCE  from  the  subsurface  into  homes,  schools,  offices,  and  other  structures.  Those
tables  included  target  indoor  air,  soil  gas,  and  groundwater  concentrations  for  TCE
based  upon  the  2001  draft  Risk  Assessment.  That  Draft  Vapor  Intrusion  Guidance
remains in limbo; EPA has no plans to finalize it.

In  January  2003,  EPA  scientists  convened  a  public  meeting  in  my  community  of
Mountain  View,  California  to  discuss  the  emerging  pathway  of  vapor  intrusion  at
a  number  of  local  TCE  cleanup  sites.  Over  400  people  attended.  EPA  scientists  ex-
plained  that  TCE  was  now  considered  five  to  65  times  as  toxic  as  previously  be-
lieved, and they introduced a screening level for TCE in indoor air, .017 micrograms
per cubic meter (µg/m3), corresponding to a one-in-a-million (‘‘ten to the minus six’’)

excess lifetime cancer risk. In fact, most EPA regions adopted that number as a pro-
visional goal.

171

EPA  and  the  Mountain  View  responsible  parties  (polluters),  including  the  Navy
and NASA, continued their vapor intrusion investigations. Testing, using the provi-
sional  screening  level,  showed  that  most  of  the  homes  at  an  award-winning  new
housing development were safe after all. However, despite the Navy’s misinterpreta-
tion of site data, we were eventually able to show that military families were being
exposed to unsafe levels of intruding TCE vapors in the Army-run Orion Park Mili-
tary Housing Area, formerly part of Moffett (Field) Naval Air Station.

In March 2004 I attended an EPA-sponsored workshop on vapor intrusion in San
Diego.  I  was  surprised  to  hear  there,  from  a  Navy  friend,  that  I  shouldn’t  worry
about  the  vapor  levels  in  Mountain  View.  EPA—the  Navy  had  been  assured—was
going  to  withdraw  the  2001  draft  Risk  Assessment.  And  indeed,  that’s  what  hap-
pened.
Back  home  in  Mountain  View,  EPA  adopted  an  interim  action  level  of  1.0  µg/m3
for  TCE  in  indoor  air.  EPA  explained  the  status  of  the  health  standard  in  its  June
2004 Draft First Five-Year Review Report for the Middlefield-Ellis-Whisman (MEW)
Superfund Study Area, Mountain View, California:

EPA’s  ORD  [Office  of  Research  and  Development]  and  OSWER  [Office  of  Solid
Waste  and  Emergency  Response]  have  requested  additional  external  peer  re-
view  of  the  draft  TCE  Health  Risk  Assessment  by  the  National  Academy  of
Sciences.  Consequently,  review  of  the  toxicity  value  for  TCE  may  continue  for
a number of years. In the interim, because of the uncertainties associated with
the  draft  TCE  Health  Risk  Assessment,  EPA  Region  9  is  considering  both  the
draft  TCE  Health  Risk  Assessment  toxicity  values,  as  well  as  the  California
TCE  toxicity  value  (similar  to  EPA’s  previously  listed  TCE  toxicity  value  from
1987), in evaluating potential health risks from exposure, and in making protec-
tiveness determinations.

That October a high EPA official told U.S. Today that the agency was ‘‘not forced
to go to the National Academy of Sciences.’’ I told the same reporter that EPA’s ac-
tion  was  like  ‘‘voluntarily’’  jumping  off  the  railroad  tracks  as  a  speeding  train  ap-
proached.

The National Academies Review

EPA actually moved the TCE issue to the same Interagency Working Group that
weakened  EPA’s  drinking  water  guideline  for  perchlorate—an  essential  component
of  solid  rocket  fuel—from  an  expected  1  ppb  to  24.5  ppb.  I  actually  learned  that
EPA,  the  White  House,  NASA,  and  the  Departments  of  Energy  and  Defense  were
following  the  perchlorate  game  plan  for  TCE  over  dinner  at  a  perchlorate  meeting
in  Las  Vegas  in  September  2004.  Making  conversation  with  a  gentleman  sitting
across  the  table,  I  found  that  he  too  had  an  interest  in  TCE.  In  fact,  as  a  Depart-
ment  of  Energy—not  EPA—official,  he  was  awarding  the  study  contract  to  the  Na-
tional  Academies  of  Sciences  for  its  TCE  review,  just  as  he  had  done  with  per-
chlorate.

I  had  been  at  one  of  the  Academy  meetings  about  perchlorate,  and  I  knew  what
a  juggernaut  of  federal  agencies  and  their  contractors  had  weighed  in  calling  for
weaker  perchlorate  standards.  So  I  encouraged  people  from  TCE-impacted  commu-
nities to attend Academy TCE Committee meetings and testify, and I was impressed
by  their  response.  For  example,  in  March  2005  a  carload  of  people  from  Endicott,
New York took the day off work and drove down to DC on their own dime, and then
drove  back  the  same  day,  only  to  be  caught  in  a  Pennsylvania  blizzard.  In  June,
West  Coast  activists  attended  and  spoke  at  the  TCE  Committee  meeting  in  Irvine,
California,  displaying  the  photos  of  workers  who  died  following  exposure  to  TCE  at
the View-master plant in Beaverton, Oregon. People from impacted communities did
not  pretend  to  have  toxicological  or  epidemiological  expertise.  They  simple  reported
that  they  and  their  neighbors  of  family  members  had  been  exposed  to  TCE.  Many
had  contracted  serious  illnesses.  And  they  wanted  the  experts  on  the  Committee  to
think about them, not just the well-funded testimony of polluters, when it continued
its deliberations.

It was at the first Academy TCE Committee meeting that the Interagency Work-
ing  Group  went  public—at  least  about  TCE.  A  White  House  official  introduced  a
panel  that  not  only  included  an  EPA  official,  but  also  representatives  of  three  fed-
eral  polluting  agencies:  NASA,  the  Department  of  Energy,  and  the  Department  of
Defense. What I had known for some time was finally out in the open: Federal agen-
cies whose primary concern about TCE was the hundreds, maybe thousands of sites
for  which  they  were  responsible  for  cleanup,  were  overseeing  the  government’s  ef-
forts  to  update  the  health  risk  data  that  would  be  incorporated  into  IRIS.  That  is,
the foxes had been given the keys to the henhouse.

In July 2006 the Academy TCE committee issued its report. It was long and com-
plicated,  and  it  provided  detailed  advice  on  how  to  conduct  additional  studies.  But
its overall conclusion was clear:

The  committee  found  that  the  evidence  on  carcinogenic  risk  and  other  health
hazards  from  exposure  to  trichloroethylene  has  strengthened  since  2001.  Hun-
dreds  of  waste  sites  in  the  United  States  are  contaminated  with  trichloro-
ethylene,  and  it  is  well  documented  that  individuals  in  many  communities  are
exposed to the chemical, with associated health risks. Thus, the committee rec-
ommends  that  federal  agencies  finalize  their  risk  assessment  with  currently
available  data  so  that  risk  management  decisions  can  be  made  expeditiously.
So  what  did  EPA  and  the  Interagency  Working  Group  do?  While  in  early  2005
they spent only a month implementing Academy recommendations for a weaker per-
chlorate  standard,  they  moved  slowly  on  TCE,  even  in  the  face  of  the  strong  Acad-
emy  recommendation.  They  moved  so  slowly  that  one  year  later  Senator  Clinton,
Senator Dole, and three other Senators introduced legislation designed to accelerate
the development of new risk data and to create an interim vapor intrusion standard
for TCE. Still EPA stalled, and EPA officials told Congress that the necessarily slow
process could actually lead to a less protective standard.

Finally,  in  April  2008  EPA  announced  its  new  IRIS  process,  essentially  institu-
tionalizing  the  informal  process  that  it  had  applied  to  TCE,  as  well  as  perchlorate.
Activists  from  throughout  the  country  responded  by  sending  the  attached  ‘‘Grass-
roots  Letter’’  to  EPA,  calling  EPA’s  action  ‘‘an  attempt  to  cement  a  privileged  posi-
tion  for  federal  polluting  agencies,  in  which  they  would  have  recurring,  generally
secret (‘deliberative’) input into EPA’s findings.’’ Ironically, one key provision in the
new process will not apply to TCE because it cannot be a ‘‘mission-critical chemical
substance.’’ In general, federal agencies no longer use TCE, though some contractors
apparently do.

It Makes a Difference

The  risk  data  for  TCE  is  not  just  an  abstract  principle.  It  makes  a  difference  in

the real world.

• My  neighbor,  Jane,  in  Mountain  View,  California  lives  across  Whisman  Avenue
from  the  birthplace  of  the  American  commercial  semiconductor  area,  now  known
as the Middlefield-Ellis-Whisman (MEW) Superfund Study Area. Historically, offi-
cial  maps  showed  her  home  just  outside  the  five  parts  per  billion  (ppb)  contour
line  that  defined  the  edge  of  the  regional  TCE  groundwater  plume.  In  March
2004, she finally got EPA and the MEW Responsible Parties to test the air in her
house.  They  found  that  TCE  from  the  MEW  plume  was  intruding  into  her  home.
TCE levels in her 11-year-old (at the time) son’s bedroom was .8 µg/m3, above the
screening level EPA had originally presented to the community, but below the in-
terim action level. Only because levels in her basement were about 4 µg/m3, above
that action level, did EPA and the companies install a ventilation system.

• In  Bayport,  Minnesota,  Shirley  lived  down  gradient  of  a  metal-plating  shop  that
released enough TCE to place much of the town on the Superfund National Prior-
ities  List  (NPL).  Shirley’s  private  drinking  water  well  tested  TCE  at  2.5  ppb  in
1988.  In  1999,  just  before  she  moved,  her  well  tested  at  4  ppb  of  TCE.  In  2002,
she  was  diagnosed  with  cancer.  In  2005  she  died.  Her  family  wants  to  know,  ‘‘If
Shirley’s  well  never  got  over  4  ppb  of  TCE,  and  she  died  of  cancer,  why  is  the
minimum  for  installing  wellhead  treatment  systems  5  ppb?’’  I  have  no  way  of
knowing  whether  the  TCE  in  Shirley’s  well  was  a  primary  cause  of  her  illness.
The  point  is  that  the  risk  management  decision  is  a  function  of  the  Maximum
Contaminant Level (MCL), which in turn is based upon IRIS data.

• In April 2003, an Air Force scientist estimated that if EPA were to lower the MCL
for  TCE  to  1  ppb  (from  5  ppb),  it  would  cost  the  Defense  Department  an  addi-
tional  $5  billion  in  current  dollars  to  address  groundwater  contamination  alone
at  its  estimated  1400  TCE  sites.  I’m  not  convinced  by  the  Air  Force  calculations,
but  it’s  clear  that  Defense  environmental  officials  believed  that  the  adoption  and
implementation  of  standards  based  upon  EPA’s  2001  draft  Human  Health  Risk
Assessment would be very costly.

Three Principles

Neither I nor the people with whom I work, people who have been exposed to sig-
nificant  levels  of  TCE  and  other  toxic  compounds,  have  the  expertise  to  determine
exactly  what  is  safe.  We  count  upon  our  government,  directed  by  you,  our  elected
officials, to establish a fair, open process to develop risk data. We ask you to direct
EPA to reverse its recent IRIS pronouncements and instead to create a new process
based upon the following three principles from the ‘‘Grassroots Letter.’’

1. All  stakeholders,  including  the  affected  public,  private  polluters,  and  federal
polluting agencies, should have the same access to the decision-making proc-
ess for the assessment of hazardous substances.

2. Federally funded risk-relevant research should be managed by agencies that
do  not  have  conflicts  of  interest—that  is,  agencies  that  will  incur  significant
costs  or  encumbrances  associated  with  more  protective  health  and  environ-
mental standards should not control these research activities.

3. The  entire  process  of  assessing  hazardous  substances  should  be  carried  out
in  the  sunshine,  with  oversight  by  the  public,  the  press,  and  by  Congress.
To  protect  our  health  and  the  health  of  future  generations,  Congress  must  guar-

antee the integrity of the IRIS process.

Dr. Greer.
STATEMENT OF DR. LINDA E. GREER, DIRECTOR, HEALTH

PROGRAM, NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL

Dr. GREER. Good morning, and thanks for the opportunity to tes-
tify. I am a toxicologist. I direct the health program at the Natural
Resources  Defense  Council,  where  I  have  been  for  15  years,  and  I
have  watched  the  EPA’s  evaluation  of  toxic  chemicals  for  many
years,  both  in  my  capacity  as  the  director  of  the  health  program
at NRDC, as a member of the executive committee of EPA’s Science
Advisory Board, where I served for six years, and on many commit-
tees at the National Academy of Sciences, including, most recently,
the Committee on Emerging Issues in Toxic Chemicals. I commend
you,  Mr.  Miller,  for  your  interest  in  the  IRIS  review  process,  and
more specifically, in your concern in the Committee’s concern about
the recent changes that have been made to this program.

IRIS is, as you have said, as cornerstone program at EPA, which
provides the scientific information necessary to develop our nation’s
air  and  drinking-water  standards  as  well  as  hazardous-waste
clean-up levels. The changes that are the subject of today’s hearing
are  yet  another  escalation  of  the  Administration’s  war  on  science
and  public  health  that  has  gone  on  for  nearly  eight  years.  It’s  a
record  of  political  interference  with  the  work  of  government  sci-
entists  across  a  range  of  environmental  issues,  including  global
warming  or  even  endangered  species,  has  been  well  established.
Things  are  no  better  in  the  case  of  analyzing  and  regulating  toxic

chemicals  that  pose  a  risk  to  health.  In  this  area,  the  Administra-
tion has attempted and in some cases succeeded in blocking, weak-
ening,  and  delaying  health  standards  for  a  very  long  list  of  pollut-
ants,  including  arsenic,  mercury,  lead,  benzene,  perchlorate,  form-
aldehyde,  particulates  and  ozone,  and  of  course,  trichloroethylene.
In  addition,  the  Administration  has  weakened  the  public’s  right  to
know about the release of toxic chemicals into their community.

Thus,  the  recent  changes  to  the  IRIS  program  that  are  the  sub-
ject  of  today’s  hearing  are  properly  viewed  as  one  part  of  a  much
broader agenda to sacrifice public health protections and limit pub-
lic  understanding  of  the  risk  of  toxic  chemicals  in  a  manner  that
benefits a host of polluting industries and federal agencies.

For  many  years,  IRIS  assessments  were  developed  by  EPA  sci-
entists.  Drafts  were  released  simultaneously  for  public  comment
and external independent peer review. OMB and government agen-
cies, such as DOD or DOE, who sometimes had a stake in the out-
come  of  the  evaluation  because  of  their  obligation  to  address  con-
tamination  at  their  facilities,  had  an  opportunity  to  review  and
comment  on  the  draft  when  it  was  released  for  public  comment.
These procedures allowed EPA scientific experts to create and own
the  assessment  and  kept  influence  by  government  agencies  with
polluter profiles to a minimum. The new process established by the
White  House  turns  this  process  on  its  head.  It  invites  interference
by OMB and other agencies, both at the onset of the process, in the
middle,  and  at  the  bitter  end—a  license-to-kill,  so  to  speak—if  the
process did not end as they wished.

Importantly, these newly introduced intervention points are con-
sidered  deliberative,  and  hence  shielded  from  public  view,  forcing
EPA to respond to concern behind closed doors, and alarmingly the
new  opportunities  are  not  limited  to  data  critiques.  One  particu-
larly  misguided  new  feature  offers  agencies  outside  of  EPA  up  to
two  years  to  undertake  their  own  additional  studies  of  ‘‘mission
critical’’  chemicals,  suspending  EPA’s  evaluation  of  these  contami-
nants  for  a  very  substantial  period  of  time  while  they  take  advan-
tage of this opportunity to delay a potential day of reckoning.

Although  current  EPA  leadership  argues  that  the  new  process
was  developed  in  order  to  provide  ‘‘greater  transparency,  objec-
tivity,  balance,  rigor,  and  predictability’’  to  the  IRIS  assessment,
we would characterize these changes quite differently. In our view,
the new process is designed precisely to give the polluting agencies
more  access,  more  opportunity  for  delay,  and  more  influence  to
what has historically been an objective scientific evaluation process
and  to  allow  these  opportunities  to  occur  behind  closed  doors,  hid-
ing the exercise of that influence from public view.

In fact, if one’s intention was to design a new system that would
deliver  greater  influence  to  government  agencies  with  pollution
problems  over  EPA  rules,  it  would  be  hard  to  think  of  a  system
that would be better than this one. The claim that the new process
will result in a more balanced and objective result simply does not
pass the laugh test.

Before  closing,  I  would  like  to  turn  briefly  to  the  issue  of  timeli-
ness,  which  as  we  have  seen  from  our  other  witnesses,  is  a  real
problem in the IRIS program. The IRIS program has always strug-
gled  to  keep  pace  with  EPA’s  regulatory  needs  and  many  environ-

mental contaminants lacking IRIS assessments are quite important
to public health, TCE, for one, perchlorate for another. There is no
IRIS risk assessments for nearly one-third of the 189 hazardous air
pollutants, for example. Furthermore, even where important chemi-
cals  are  in  the  IRIS  database,  the  risk  assessments  available  for
many  of  these  chemicals  are  outdated.  The  average  assessment  on
IRIS  is  over  13  years  old  with  the  oldest  having  not  been  signifi-
cantly  revised  since  the  mid-1980’s,  and,  as  has  been  mentioned,
these  problems  greatly  exacerbate  the  already  long  period  of  time
required  for  EPA  standard-setting  procedures,  up  to  a  decade  in
some cases, and have been the focus of criticism for some time.

Clearly,  constructive  reform  of  the  IRIS  program  is  needed  and
constructive  reform  would  focus  on  increasing  resources  available
to  undertake  IRIS  reviews  as  well  as  policy  changes  that  would
streamline  the  difficult  decision-making  inherent  in  the  process.
The new procedures run completely counter to these goals and will
only  exacerbate  the  backlog.  Properly  implemented,  the  EPA  IRIS
program  provides  a  crucial  scientific  service  to  the  public,  and  I
emphasize speed is important but scientific integrity is paramount.
These  changes  hit  IRIS  on  both  fronts  in  a  terrible  way,  slowing
the process further and compromising its content. We request that
the  Science  Committee  and  the  Subcommittee  work  with  other
House colleagues to ensure that the new IRIS process is overturned
or  withdrawn  and  that  you  require  IRIS  health  assessments  to  be
reviewed  in  an  open  process  without  inappropriate  political  inter-
ference. Thank you very much for this opportunity to testify.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Greer follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF LINDA E. GREER

Good  morning  and  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  testify  on  the  failure  of  the

EPA IRIS program to serve the needs of the public.

My  name  is  Linda  Greer,  and  I  direct  the  Health  Program  at  the  Natural  Re-
sources  Defense  Council,  where  I  have  worked  for  more  than  fifteen  years.  I  have
a Master’s degree in public health and a Ph.D., in environmental toxicology. I have
watch-dogged EPA’s evaluation of toxic chemical hazards and risks for many years,
both  in  my  capacity  as  the  Health  Program  Director  at  NRDC  and  as  a  member
of the Executive Committee of EPA’s Science Advisory Board, where I served for six
years. I have also served on many committees of the National Academy of Sciences,
including  most  recently  the  Committee  on  Emerging  Issues  in  toxic  chemicals  and
served on the NAS Board on Life Sciences from 2001–2004. The Natural Resources
Defense  Council  (NRDC)  is  a  national,  nonprofit  organization  of  scientists,  lawyers
and environmental specialists dedicated to protecting public health and the environ-
ment. Founded in 1970, NRDC has 1.2 million members and online activists, served
from  offices  in  New  York,  Washington,  Chicago,  Los  Angeles,  San  Francisco  and
Beijing.

NRDC’s  Health  program  focuses  on  toxic  chemical  pollutants  in  air,  water,  food,
and shelter. Over the years, we have focused our particular attention on the ‘‘biggest
pollutants’’  in  these  media,  the  ones  disproportionately  responsible  for  the  biggest
threats  to  human  health.  This  has  led  to  successful  efforts  to  substantially  reduce
diesel  air  emissions  from  trucks  and  buses,  for  example,  and  to  take  a  number  of
dangerous  and  outdated  pesticides  off  the  market.  There  are  more  than  70,000
chemicals  in  commerce,  but  some  are  much  more  toxic  than  others,  and  we  can
make  great  progress  in  environmental  health  protection  if  eve  focus  on  the  chemi-
cals pollutants that pose the greatest threat to human and ecological health.

We  commend  the  Science  and  Technology  Committee  and  this  subcommittee  for
its  interest  in  the  EPA  Integrated  Risk  Information  System  (IRIS)  chemical  review
process and its oversight of recent changes made by EPA and the Bush Administra-
tion.  These  changes  are  yet  another  escalation  of  the  Administration’s  war  on
science and public health that has gone on for nearly eight years. Its record of polit-
ical  interference  with  the  work  of  government  scientists  across  a  range  of  environ-

mental  issues  including  global  warming  and  endangered  species  has  been  well-es-
tablished. Things are no better in the case of analyzing and regulating toxic chemi-
cals  that  pose  a  risk  to  public  health.  In  this  area,  the  Administration  has  at-
tempted (and in some instances succeeded) to block, weaken, or delay health stand-
ards  for  a  long  list  of  dangerous  pollutants  including  arsenic,  mercury,  lead,  ben-
zene,  perchlorate,  formaldehyde,  particulates  and  ozone.  In  addition,  the  Adminis-
tration has weakened the public’s right to know about the release of toxic chemicals
into their communities.

Thus, the recent changes to the IRIS process that are the subject of today’s hear-
ing  should  properly  be  viewed  as  one  part  of  a  much  broader  agenda  to  sacrifice
public  health  protections  and  limit  public  understanding  of  the  risk  of  toxic  chemi-
cals,  in  a  manner  that  benefits  a  host  of  polluting  industries  and  federal  agencies.
Indeed,  by  attempting  to  weaken  the  IRIS  process,  the  Administration  has  zeroed
in  on  one  of  the  earliest  and  most  fundamental  steps  in  the  process  of  protecting
public health, that in which EPA’s scientists identify the health risks posed by expo-
sure  to  certain  chemicals.  The  Committee’s  hearings  should  preface  Congressional
action  to  reverse  the  recent  changes  to  the  IRIS  process  and  ensure  the  integrity
and effectiveness of the program is restored.

The importance of the IRIS database

The  IRIS  database  is  a  publicly  available  database  which  contains  EPA’s  evalua-
tion  of  potential  human  health  effects  from  exposure  to  more  than  540  chemicals,
including  highly  hazardous  chemicals  such  as  vinyl  chloride,  butadiene,  benzene,
lead,  mercury,  and  asbestos.1 While  these  evaluations  are  not  regulations  per  se,
they are used by both State and federal regulators and by the international commu-
nity for a range of environmental health regulation and management purposes. For
example,  the  information  can  be  used  in  combination  with  exposure  data  to  set
cleanup levels at hazardous waste sites, or to set exposure standards for air, water,
soil,  and  food.  Thus,  the  accuracy,  credibility,  and  timeliness  of  IRIS  assessments
have real world consequences for human health.

The  global  importance  of  this  database  cannot  be  overstated.  For  example,  in
May,  2008  alone,  the  IRIS  website  received  almost  25,000  requests  (an  average  of
over 800 per day), from over 2,000 separate computer sources and from over 60 dif-
ferent countries.2

IRIS conducts scientific assessments, not policy documents

Risk  assessments  involve  the  integration  of  hazard  identification,  dose-response
assessment,  and  exposure  assessment  to  estimate  the  probability  (likelihood)  of
harm. Rather than conducting entire risk assessments, the IRIS program is limited
to conducting hazard identification and assessing dose-response relationships for en-
vironmental chemicals; EPA factors in exposure scenarios and risks under its regu-
latory programs.

Hazard identification, the first step in a risk analysis, determines whether or not
the  substance  of  concern  is  likely  to  have  adverse  health  effects.  This  step  requires
a thorough review of relevant toxicologic data and may include human epidemiology,
whole animal studies, non-animal data, and field data. The result is a scientific de-
termination  of  whether  or  not  a  substance  causes  adverse  health  outcomes  such  as
cancer,  neurological  disease,  birth  defects,  or  death.  Since  reliable  human  data  is
often not available, hazard evaluations generally rely heavily on identifying whether
the substance is toxic in animals or other test systems.

The  dose-response  assessment  follows  hazard  identification  and  is  designed  to
identify  safe  levels  of  exposure  for  chemicals  that  pose  harm.  This  assessment  con-
sists of scientifically characterizing the relationship between the amount of exposure
(dose)  and  the  incidence  of  an  adverse  health  endpoint.  Methodologies  for  dose-re-
sponse  assessment  often  differ  between  cancer  and  non-cancer  effects  and  between
acute and chronic exposure scenarios. They are often scientifically controversial, be-
cause  they  must  extrapolate  from  high  experimental  doses  to  more  typical  ambient
exposure levels.

Ideally,  epidemiological  data  would  be  available  that  clearly  illuminate  the  haz-
ards  and  the  dose-response  relationships  for  chemicals  of  concern  in  human  popu-
lations.  Unfortunately,  this  is  nearly  never  the  case.  Most  chemicals  lack  key  stud-
ies  of  effects  in  humans  as  well  as  studies  of  effects  in  animals  at  ambient  levels.

As  a  result,  IRIS  assessors  are  called  upon  to  make  informed  judgments  regarding
the relevance of the animal data to humans, and to select the most appropriate ex-
trapolation method. Further, the IRIS assessments require independent expert judg-
ment to decide whether various safety factors should be applied to assessment data
to  ensure  public  health  protection.  For  example.  EPA  often  decides  to  include  mar-
gins of safety to protect vulnerable populations, relevant genetic variations, vulner-
able life stages, disease states, concomitant exposure to complex mixtures, and other
relevant  factors  that  may  influence  the  probability  of  an  effect  caused  by  exposure
to the substance of concern.

Importantly,  decisions  made  in  the  IRIS  program  are  informed  by  various  EPA
guidance  documents  that  are  publicly-available  and  publicly-documented,  and  have
been  publicly-vetted.  Reliance  on  these  important  guidance  documents  is  crucial  to
ensure  that  evaluations  are  consistent  across  substances  and  as  objective  as  pos-
sible.

The  new  process  established  by  the  White  House  turns  this  process  on  its  head:
it  invites  the  injection  of  non-scientific  considerations  into  the  IRIS  assessments,
and further, it shields from public scrutiny the input from other parts of the govern-
ment  with  a  potential  financial  or  political  interest  in  the  outcome  of  a  particular
assessment. When political appointees, perhaps acting on behalf of regulated indus-
tries, and polluting agencies are able to interfere in a non-transparent and inappro-
priate manner, the whole process is severely compromised.

Summary of the new process

The new 2008 IRIS process introduces three new opportunities for OMB and other
non-health  agencies  to  weigh  in  on  EPA’s  health  assessments,  where  previously
there was only one. Importantly, interagency comments and OMB comments for all
three  of  the  new  intervention  points  are  shielded  from  public  view:  the  first  two
bites  at  the  apple,  and  the  last  one.  Thus,  whereas  the  pre-2004  IRIS  process  pro-
vided  the  agencies  and  OMB  with  the  draft  assessment  at  the  same  time  as  it  was
provided to the public, the new process injects polluting agencies such as DOD and
DOE  into  the  assessment  process  at  an  earlier  stage,  and  forces  the  IRIS  staff  to
address  the  interests  of  the  agencies  and  OMB,  whether  they  are  consistent  with
health-protective  policies  or  not.  These  exchanges  take  place  out  of  the  public  eye.
Following  this  negotiation,  the  draft  review  is  publicly  noticed.  But  then  there  is  a
final  intervention  point  provided  to  OMB  and  the  other  agencies  that  require  that
the IRIS staff to resolve any outstanding concerns by OMB and the other agencies,
including polluting agencies, before the assessment can be finalized. While the 2008
process boils down to ‘death by a thousand cuts,’ this ability to have the last word—
and to axe an assessment at the bitter end—may be the deepest cut of all.

The  U.S.  Government  Accountability  Office  (GAO)  recently  released  its  review  of
the new process, in a report entitled: Low Productivity and New Interagency Review
Process  Limit  the  Usefulness  and  Credibility  of  EPA’s  Integrated  Risk  Information
System.3 This  report  provided  a  detailed  and  highly  critical  assessment  of  the  fail-
ures  of  the  IRIS  program  to  meet  its  deadlines  and  requirements,  blaming  in  large
part the interference by polluting agencies and political appointees. The GAO report
predicts  that  the  new  process  will  produce  IRIS  assessments  that  lack  credibility,
and will worsen what is already a critical backlog of new and updated assessments.
NRDC  agrees  with  the  GAO  evaluation,  whose  many  findings  validate  our  years  of
work to right this cornerstone program for public health protection.

For many years, IRIS assessments were developed by EPA scientists. Drafts were
released simultaneously for public comment and external (independent expert) peer
review.  OMB  and  government  agencies  such  as  DOD  or  DOE,  who  sometimes  had
a stake in the outcome of the evaluation because of their obligations to address con-
tamination  at  federal  facilities,  had  an  opportunity  to  review  and  comment  on  the
draft when it was released for public review and comment.

The  new  IRIS  process  introduces  significant  new  steps  that  are  both  time-con-
suming  and  undermine  the  objectivity  and  transparency  necessary  for  credible  and
valid  assessments  (see  Table  1).  Significant  aspects  of  the  new  process  are  as  fol-
lows:

1. In the 2008 process, IRIS staff is now required to develop a qualitative draft
assessment,  prior  to  the  quantitative  assessment,  which  must  undergo  both
public  and  interagency  review.  This  qualitative  draft  serves  as  a  summary
of the scientific literature that the staff intends to rely on to supports its as-
sessment.  Although  this  procedure  sounds  benign,  it  seriously  compromises
the  timeliness  and  transparency  of  the  IRIS  program.  First,  it  allows  other
government agencies to delay an assessment far nearly two years to do addi-
tional  research  on  any  chemicals  that  an  agency  deems  to  be  ‘‘mission  crit-
ical,’’  thereby  significantly  stalling  the  start  of  the  formal  IRIS  evaluation.
Even  more  alarming,  the  comments  and  submissions  of  the  other  agencies
to  the  qualitative  draft  are  considered  ‘deliberative’  which,  if  unchallenged
or upheld by the courts, would shield the comments from public scrutiny.

2. In  the  new  2008  process,  agencies  outside  of  EPA  are  invited  to  designate
chemicals  as  ‘mission  critical’  and  to  intervene  in  the  IRIS  assessment  of
these chemicals. Mission critical chemicals are defined as those that are, ‘‘an
integral component to the successful and safe conduct of an Agency’s mission
in  any  or  all  phases  of  its  operations.  Impacts  on  use  of  mission  critical
chemicals  include  cessation  car  degradation  of  the  conduct  of  the  mission
and/or unacceptable resource constraints.’’ [emphasis added] In other words,
‘‘mission  critical’’  chemicals  includes  not  only  those  that  are  vital  and  have
no  viable  substitute,  but  also  those  where  the  potential  cost  to  an  agency  of
cleaning up a pollution mess it (or its contractors) have created is ‘‘unaccept-
able’’  or  where  potential  future  limitations  on  use  (such  as  stricter  exposure
standards)  are  deemed  too  expensive  by  the  agency.  These  are  exactly  the
kinds  of  policy  considerations  that  should  not  be  allowed  to  intrude  on  the
IRIS assessment process.

3. Following  the  quantitative  draft,  the  IRIS  staff  develops  the  draft  quan-
titative assessment (the Toxicological Review). This is subjected to public and
interagency  review,  followed  by  external  (independent  expert)  peer  review.
The important difference is that prior to 2004, this represented the first and
simultaneous opportunity for both the public and the other agencies to com-
ment, with all comments publicly accessible. By contrast, with the 2008 proc-
ess this is now the second public comment. opportunity, and the third OMB/
interagency  intervention  point,  but  the  first  where  the  OMB/interagency
comments would be publicly accessible.

4. Finally,  before  the  IRIS  assessment  can  be  finalized  and  publicly  released,
the 2008 process requires OMB and interagency approval. The pre-2004 proc-
ess  had  only  required  internal  agency  review.  This  2008  process  invites  the
fourth and final opportunity for OMB/interagency interference with the eval-
uation. Although the new process says that EPA has the power to make the
final  decision,  it  is  clear  that  the  other  agencies  and  OMB  will  have  signifi-
cant access and influence over the final editing choices.

Although  current  EPA  leadership  argues  that  the  new  process  was  developed  in
order  to  provide  ‘‘greater  transparency,  objectivity,  balance,  rigor  and  predict-
ability’’ 4 to the IRIS assessments, we strongly disagree. In fact, the administration’s
claims  are  Orwellian.  This  new  process  is  designed  precisely  to  give  the  polluting
agencies  more  access  and  more  influence  to  what  has  historically  been  an  objective
scientific  evaluation  process—and  to  add  at  least  two  or  more  years  to  the  review
of mission critical chemicals.

To  put  it  plainly,  in  this  new  proposal,  the  Administration  is  attempting  to  pro-
vide  those  agencies  with  the  most  at  stake  in  the  degree  of  protection  established
for  a  particular  chemical  multiple  opportunities  to  weigh-in  and  influence  the  out-
come of EPA’s decisions, while hiding the exercise of that influence from the public.
The Administration’s claim that, for example, providing the Department of Defense
multiple  opportunities  to  weaken  or  delay  setting  a  health  standard  for  TCE—a
chemical  for  which  DOD  is  responsible  of  widespread  contamination  of  drinking
water—completely  outside  of  public  view,  will  result  in  a  more  balanced  and  objec-
tive result, doesn’t pass the laugh test.

The  EPA  leadership  further  claims  that  the  outcome  of  the  new  process  is  ex-
pected  to  ‘streamline’  the  IRIS  process  and  make  it  more  ‘transparent.’  Again,  we

strongly  disagree.  The  new  process  allows  public  review  at  only  one  stage,  which
is  review  of  the  qualitative  draft.  All  other  evaluation  steps  occur  behind  closed
doors, shielded from accountability to the public or other more objective, outside sci-
entific experts.

It  is  indicative  of  the  Administration’s  disregard  for  public  input  on  its  changes
to  the  IRIS  process,  and  its  eagerness  to  put  them  in  place,  that  OMB  admonished
GAO  for  being  so  critical  of  a  draft  proposal,  and  assured  the  GAO  that  ‘‘[i]ndeed,
the process will not be complete until EPA circulates its draft to the public for com-
ments  and  then  releases  a  final  product  that  is  responsive  to  those  comments.’’  As-
surances  notwithstanding,  some  six  weeks  later  the  Administration  finalized  this
deeply flawed proposal without any opportunity for public review or comment. This
short-circuiting  of  the  public  comment  process  does  not  square  with  the  principles
of  public  right-to-know,  or  EPA’s  lip  service  in  support  of  an  open  and  transparent
process.

Backlog at IRIS: Timeliness is already a terrible problem that cannot bear

to be compounded by further delay

In  the  U.S.,  there  are  about  8,000  chemicals  in  commerce  deemed  ‘‘economically
significant’’ (i.e., produced or imported at a rate greater than 10,000 pounds per site
annually).  Unfortunately,  only  about  550  chemicals  in  total  have  been  evaluated  in
the IRIS program. Even when compared just to the universe of chemicals regulated
by  EPA,  IRIS  is  obviously  failing  to  adequately  serve  the  public’s  needs.  For  in-
stance, the EPA is responsible for regulating the emissions of 188 hazardous air pol-
lutants  (HAPs)  under  the  Clean  Air  Act,  but  only  129  of  them  appear  in  the  IRIS
database.  In  other  words,  in  almost  20  years  since.  IRIS  was  created,  the  EPA  has
been  unable  to  complete  Toxicological  Reviews  for  nearly  one-third  of  these  dan-
gerous pollutants.

Furthermore,  even  when  important  chemicals  are  in  the  IRIS  database,  the  risk
assessments available for many of these chemicals are outdated: the average assess-
ment on IRIS is over 13 years old, with the oldest having not been significantly re-
vised  since  the  mid-1980s.  Considerable  new  evidence  of  toxicity  has  emerged  for
many of these chemicals since their last assessment, which renders tile conclusions
potentially obsolete and limits their usefulness and credibility with regulatory agen-
cies.

According  to  the  IRIS  website,  the  program  has  finalized  only  thirteen  assess-
ments since 2004. As GAO notes ‘‘[t]he IRIS database is at serious risk of becoming
obsolete  because  EPA  has  not  been  able  to  routinely  complete  timely,  credible  as-
sessments or decrease its backlog of 70 ongoing assessments.’’ 5

Consider  for  example  Trichloroethylene  (TCE),  a  solvent  used  as  a  degreasing
agent.  TCE  is  one  of  the  roost  common  contaminants  of  Superfund  sites  across  the
Nation,  primarily  from  military  uses,  and  is  linked  to  cancer,  including  childhood
cancer,  and  birth  defects.6 The  IRIS  draft  was  initiated  a  decade  ago,  in  1998.  In
2001,  EPA  concluded  that  TCE  was  ‘‘highly  likely’’  to  cause  cancer  and  specifically
noted the added health risks when exposures took place during childhood. Finaliza-
tion  of  that  assessment  has  been  held  up  after  repeated  objections  from  military
contractors and the Department of Defense. Finally it was reviewed by the National
Academies,  which  issued  their  report  in  July  2006,  finding  that  the  data  linking
TCE  with  cancer  was  even  stronger  than  EPA  IRIS  staff  had  determined,  and  rec-
ommending that the IRIS assessment be finalized as soon as possible. Nonetheless,
the Defense Department continued to insist that it not be finalized until more data
was available, and today the assessment has still not been finalized.

Clearly,  constructive  reform  for  the  IRIS  program  would  focus  on  increasing  re-
sources  available  to  undertake  IRIS  reviews  as  well  as  policy  changes  that  would
streamline the difficult decision-making inherent in the process. The new procedures
run completely counter to these goals and will only exacerbate this backlog.

Delays to IRIS assessments result in continued unsafe exposures to humans

and wildlife

Setting  a  health  assessment  standard  under  IRIS  is  only  the  first  step  in  a  long
regulatory process. For example, for the EPA to establish a national drinking water
standard,  the  Agency  would  typically  reach  out  to  stakeholders  for  input  and  per-
haps even convene a Federal Advisory Committee, which could take over a year. Ad-

ditionally,  the  docket  for  a  proposed  rule  could  remain  open  for  at  least  a  few
months  to  collect  comments  from  the  public.  Depending  on  the  extent  of  the  com-
ments  received,  the  Agency  could  again  take  up  to  a  year  or  more  to  address  and
respond  to  those  comments.  In  the  end,  it  could  take  the  Agency  years,  even  dec-
ades, to finalize a drinking water regulation.

As  new  or  updated  IRIS  assessments  continue  to  languish,  or  get  weakened  to
satisfy  the  demands  of  OMB  and  federal  agencies  including  the  Department  of  De-
fense  and  Department  of  Energy,  the  process  of  setting  health  standards  becomes
unspeakably  prolonged.  And  the  public  continues  to  suffer  due  to  lack  of  adequate
public health protections.

For  example.  the  Administration  has  successfully  blocked  a  much  needed  update
of  the  IRIS  assessment  for  formaldehyde.  An  updated  assessment  reflecting  recent
science  that  shows  greater  health  hazards  posed  by  formaldehyde  could  ultimately
be the basis of establishing stricter emissions or exposure limits from building mate-
rials  and  other  sources.  Meanwhile,  people  living  in  temporary  trailers  provided  by
FEMA  after  Hurricane  Katrina  have  complained  of  a  host  of  illnesses  they  believe
are  related  to  the  high  levels  of  formaldehyde  which  they  have  been  exposed  to  in
those trailers.

Similarly, delay in IRIS has contributed to an inexcusable failure to develop a na-
tional  health-protective  standard  for  perchlorate,  a  component  of  rocket  fuel  and
other  explosives,  in  drinking  water.  Scientific  evidence  is  overwhelming  that  expo-
sure  to  perchlorate,  an  iodine  uptake  inhibitor  in  the  thyroid  gland,  can  cause  sig-
nificant  development  problems  for  developing  infants.  Subtle  alterations  of  thyroid
hormones  during  pregnancy—even  within  the  normal  range—have  been  associated
with decreased intellectual and learning capacity in childhood.

Approximately  350  public  water  systems  serving  over  41  million  have  reported
perchlorate  detections.7 The  source  of  the  contamination  at  many  of  these  sites  is
defense  and  aerospace  facilities  and  military  installations.8 The  Defense  Depart-
ment  mounted  a  years-long  battle,  and  elicited  White  House  support,  against  IRIS
draft  assessments  in  1998  and  in  2002  that  had  determined  that  even  low  doses  of
perchlorate  may  be  harmful  to  early  development  of  the  human  brain.9 The  final
IRIS  assessment  was  not  completed  until  2005.  Due  to  the  year’s  long  delay  in  as-
sessing  and  quantifying  the  harm  posed  by  perchlorate  in  the  IRIS  program,  the
public  remains  years  away  from  a  national  drinking  water  standard  that  will  pro-
tect their health.

Objectivity and transparency of IRIS review is paramount

IRIS assessments must be shielded from political interference and be open to pub-
lic scrutiny to ensure their scientific rigor and adherence to public health protective
policies.

Under the new IRIS process, polluting federal agencies are provided excessive and
redundant  opportunities  to  intervene  in  the  development  of  the  IRIS  assessments,
shielded  from  scrutiny  by  the  scientific  community  and  the  public.  This  is  indefen-
sible.  The  IRIS  assessments  and  the  comments  provided  by  federal  agencies,  aca-
demics,  industry,  public  interest  groups,  the  general  public,  and  others  regarding
drafts  are  supposed  to  be  about  science.  The  Administration  has  no  reason  for  in-
sisting upon secrecy other than to shield injection of politics and policy into the sci-
entific  debate,  and  avoid  public  airing  of  scientific  arguments  that  won’t  stand  up
to public scrutiny.

Political  appointees  in  the  EPA  undermine  EPA’s  mandate  to  protect

human health and the environment

The Director of the IRIS program, George Gray, is clearly subverting the mission
of the EPA in the development of the new IRIS process, essentially carrying out the
mission of the OMB instead. Gray, who is EPA Assistant Administrator for the Of-
fice of Research and Development, was previously the Director of the Harvard Cen-
ter  for  Risk  Analysis,  a  seemingly  prestigious  academic  center  but  one  quite  noto-
rious  for  its  extensive  support  from  with  corporate  money  and  its  tendency  to  pro-
mote industry perspectives in environmental health policy deliberations. With Gray
holding  direct  management  power  over  the  IRIS  program,  the  Administration  has

ensured that EPA resistance to the agenda of undermining public health protections
will be minimal, and, more often, will be aided by its political appointee.

A  documented  example  of  Gray’s  role  in  blocking  the  work  of  his  own  IRIS  staff
is  the  case  of  the  Toxicological  Review  of  tetrachloroethylene  also  known  as
perchloroethylene  (perc),  a  dry  cleaning  and  degreasing  chemical  and  widespread
groundwater contaminant. The IRIS assessment was initiated in 1998. In 2006 Risk
Policy  Report  revealed  that  George  Gray  was  insisting  that  his  staff  re-analyze  the
cancer  risks  of  the  chemical  to  try  to  fit  the  data  to  a  model  that  would  have  as-
sumed  (without  scientific  evidence)  that  low  doses  were  safe,  whereas  the  staff’s
careful  review  of  all  available  data  did  not  support  this  assumption.10 In  addition,
Gray’s directive contradicts EPA’s established, peer-reviewed cancer guidelines. Had
the IRIS staff complied with Gray’s directive, it would have resulted in a less-protec-
tive assessment. This assessment has still not been updated.11

In short, the political appointee currently in charge of the IRIS program, and de-
fending  the  Administration’s  new  reforms  to  Congress  and  the  public,  has  blocked
an updated assessment of a chemical polluting groundwater across the Nation, and
is  insisting  EPA  scientists  use  unsupported  and  unprotective  assumptions  in  a
model intended to downplay the potential harm posed to the public by the chemical.
According  to  NRDC  discussions  with  IRIS  staff,  additional  instances  of  inter-

ference by George Gray to delay or weaken assessments include:

• blocking IRIS from posting acute (less than 24 hour) risk values.12 Acute risk
values are relevant to communities that are exposed to chemicals by burst re-
leases  of  toxics  (smokestacks,  etc.)  that  may  not  exceed  short-term  (days-
weeks)  or  long-term  (months-years)  regulatory  standards,  but  may  still  pose
a hazard to acutely exposed individuals.
• blocking IRIS from posting summaries of its assessments online, arguing that
the  summaries  give  a  naı¨ve  public  and  regulators  inaccurate  impressions,
contribute to misunderstandings, and are misused.
• blocking  the  IRIS  staff  recommendations  to  apply  a  10-fold  safety  factor  to
site-specific  assessments  where  children  may  be  exposed  to  ethylene  oxide,  a
potent  human  carcinogen  with  evidence  that  exposures  during  early  life  sig-
nificantly  increase  the  risk  of  developing  cancer.  Use  of  such  a  safety  factor
under precisely these conditions is specifically recommended in the EPA Sup-
plemental Cancer Guidelines on Children’s Exposure.

These examples should be alarming to any Member of Congress, and any member
of the public, who cares about ensuring that the best science is used by EPA to de-
termine the risks posed by dangerous chemicals and who cares about fully informing
the  public  about  the  risks  posed  by  exposure  to  toxic  chemicals.  It  also  illustrates
why NRDC and other environmental and public health groups, as well as the GAO,
are  so  concerned  about  the  changes  to  the  IRIS  process  that  will  allow  more  of  the
decision-making  to  take  place  behind  closed  doors,  where  political  appointees  can
make  demands  on  career  employees,  without  having  to  defend  the  merits  of  their
scientific arguments (or the injection of policy and political preferences in a scientific
process) before the public.

Conclusion

Properly implemented, the EPA IRIS program provides a critical scientific service
to  the  public.  Like  other  vital  EPA  programs,  it  must  be  preserved  and  protected
so  that  EPA’s  scientists  can  conduct  their  work  without  political  interference.  The
EPA’s authority to determine the risks posed by hazardous chemicals should not be
sacrificed  to  the  desire  of  other  federal  agencies’  or  industry  interests  in  avoiding
clean-up  costs  or  requirements  for  additional  controls  on  emissions  and  exposures.
We  request  that  the  Science  Committee  work  with  other  House  colleagues  to  en-
sure that the new IRIS process is overturned or withdrawn and require IRIS health
assessments to be reviewed in an open process, without inappropriate political inter-
ference.

There are hundreds of potentially dangerous chemicals that are either already in
the IRIS database but need to be updated, or that have not yet been added. Without
an open, credible, effective, science-based, fully-funded program to develop these as-
sessments  without  political  interference  from  the  White  House  or  other  federal
agencies,  EPA  will  continue  to  fall  further  behind  in  a  fundamental  program  that
serves  as  the  foundation  for  fulfilling  its  mission:  protecting  the  environment  and
public health.

Thank you for the opportunity to testify today.

BIOGRAPHY FOR LINDA E. GREER

Linda E. Greer joined the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) in 1990 as
a Senior Scientist specializing in public health issues, especially toxic chemicals and
hazardous waste. She now is the Director of the Environment and Health Program.
Linda  is  currently  focusing  on  the  scientific  controversies  in  determining  toxicity  of
chemicals  in  regulation  and  on  mercury  pollution.  Prior  initiatives  have  most  nota-
bly  included  pollution  prevention  opportunities  at  large  chemical  manufacturing  fa-
cilities,  where  she  directed  a  large  and  successful  collaborative  project  to  reduce
toxic  wastes  and  releases  with  the  Dow  Chemical  Company.  Linda  has  been  ap-
pointed  to  the  Board  of  Life  Sciences  for  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  as  well
as  the  U.S.  EPA  Science  Advisory  Board  Executive  Committee,  and  she  serves  sev-
eral other technical and policy advisory groups.

Dr.  Greer  teaches  an  intensive  summer  course,  ‘‘Scientific  Fundamentals  of  Risk
Assessment’’  for  law  students  and  practicing  lawyers,  which  she  has  done  for  ten
years,  and  she  has  taught  a  graduate-level  class  to  scientists  in  toxic  chemical  im-
pact and regulation.

She received her Ph.D. in Environmental Toxicology from the University of Mary-
land  in  1989,  M.S.P.H.  in  Environmental  Sciences  and  Engineering  from  UNC–
Chapel Hill, and B.S. in Biology from Tufts University.

Dr.  Greer  is  the  author  of  over  a  dozen  technical  and  policy  articles  on  environ-

mental matters, and has frequently testified before Congress.

DISCUSSION

DELIBERATIVE, INTERAGENCY DECISION-MAKING

Chairman MILLER. Thank you, Dr. Greer.
At  this  point  we  will  have  our  first  round  of  questions,  and  the
Chair  now  recognizes  himself  for  five  minutes.  Mr.  Ensminger,  as
you know, as other witnesses have testified, the current IRIS proc-
ess  allows  repeated  interagency,  intragovernmental  discussions
about  the  health  risk  assessments.  Those  discussions,  to  use  the
word  that  Dr.  Greer  quoted,  are  deliberative.  You  would  probably
call  those  secret.  The  doors  are  closed.  We  are  not  entirely  sure
what  happens  in  there.  But  your  testimony  made  it  pretty  clear
that you do not believe that your former employer, the Department
of Defense, talks about public health or expresses concern for pub-
lic health. They are more concerned about potential clean-up costs,
Mr.  Siegel  said  perhaps  as  much  as  $5  billion.  What  they  are  not
doing  is  talking  about  the  public  good.  I  have  always  thought  that
democracy  dies  behind  closed  doors.  To  use  Justice  Brandeis’s
phrase,  sunlight  is  the  best  disinfectant  and  the  electric  light  the
most  efficient  policeman,  but  last  week  in  our  hearings,  Susan
Dudley,  the  head  of  OIRA,  the  Office  of  Information  and  Regu-
latory  Affairs  at  OMB,  the  office  within  OMB  that  supervises  this
interagency,  intragovernmental  process,  extolled  the  virtues  of
closed-door meetings. She said that it encouraged candor, that peo-
ple could say exactly what was on their mind and not worry about
the  consequences  of  it  because  they  knew  that  what  they  had  to
say would go no further and therefore they could say exactly what
they  thought  and  that  the  process  was  better  as  a  result.  Do  you

Mr. SIEGEL. Well, I am basically there representing the impacted

have  any  thoughts  on  her  view  of  the  virtues  of  closed-door  meet-
ings and a deliberative process to decide?

Master  Sergeant  ENSMINGER.  Mr.  Chairman,  it  is  my  opinion
that  if  somebody  has  to  go  behind  closed  doors  to  say  something,
they  have  something  to  hide,  and  why  else  wouldn’t  they  want  to
say it out in the open. If you can’t say it out in front of everybody,
maybe you better keep your mouth shut.

Chairman  MILLER.  Right  out  in  front  of  God  and  everybody,  as

we would say in North Carolina.
Mr. Siegel, do you have a——
Mr. SIEGEL. I have a slightly different perspective. I have served
on  a  number  of  National  Academy  of  Science’s  committees  dealing
with  various  contaminations  at  Department  of  Defense  facilities,
and  those  meetings,  they  exclude  DOD  and  we  have  a  number  of
scientists  talking  frankly,  and  that  works  because  I  am  in  the
room,  because  they  have  a  representative  of  the  public  interest  in
the room to make sure that it is not just a few people trying to pull
the  wool  over  everybody  else’s  eyes.  There  are  stages  and  various
processes  where,  you  know,  private  discussions  may  make  sense
but not if a major interest group is excluded.

Chairman  MILLER.  And  I  am  sorry,  who  would  you  include  as  a

Mr. SIEGEL. Yeah, and I strongly believe that my presence affects
what  other  people  in  the  room  say  because,  you  know,  not  that  I
am  going  to  run  to  the  press  and  leak  something  but  they  have  to
treat  things  differently  when  they  know  that  there  is  somebody
who is asking real questions.

Chairman  MILLER.  You  think  perhaps  the  candor  that  Susan
Dudley  thought  was  a  virtue  of  being  able  to  say  whatever  you
thought was actually not such a virtue and——

Mr.  SIEGEL.  I  mean,  this  is  almost  like  a  brainstorming  session
where people are saying I think this but I am not really sure, and
so  in  the  privacy  of  that  environment,  people  will  say  things  they
aren’t sure of and then say oh, I see, you are right, and they aren’t
quoted in the press and the thing isn’t taken too far, but that only
works  if  it  is  open  to  other  people  with  other  interests,  and  that
is a scientific discussion. That is not a political discussion.

Chairman MILLER. Dr. Greer.
Dr.  GREER.  Well,  I  think  the  important  principle  here  is  trans-
parency  and  accountability  of  the  decision-making  process,  and
what  we  have  seen  through  the  IRIS  experiences  is  that  behind
closed doors, arguments are made, data is hidden, and the decision
that  comes  out  in  the  end  is  not  transparent  and  is  not  account-
able, so although there may be a minor role for informal conversa-
tions  to  try  to  get  your  act  together,  the  general  principle  for  all
EPA  rule-making  is  one  of  transparency  and  accountability  to  the
public  and  to  all  affected  parties,  and  that  is  what  we  lose  with
these  closed-door  deliberations,  which  are  decision-making  delib-
erations.

OIRA’S ROLE IN THE IRIS PROCESS

Chairman  MILLER.  The  current  interagency  process,  the  IRIS
listing  process,  the  one—actually  the  one  that  preceded  the  one
that  was  adopted  in  April  seemed  to  have  the  OIRA,  OMB  really
in control because it was interagency and now it seems to be more
clearly  in  control  in  a  process  that  statutes  seem  to  contemplate
the EPA would run. Do you think the EPA is capable of conducting
an  interagency  discussion  on  its  own  or  they  need  OMB  standing
over their shoulder or actually being the ones themselves to decide,
Dr. Greer?

Dr.  GREER.  Well,  EPA  is  absolutely  capable  of  doing  that.  I
mean, this is really at the core of scientific deliberation. They have
guidance  documents  on  principles  of  how  to  make  these  decisions
and  they  have  decades  of  experience  in  making  these  decisions.  I
would  contrast  that  against  any  of  the  scientific  experts  in  any  of
these agencies who are really in a much less expertise, less experi-
ence and this is really EPA’s arena.

Chairman MILLER. Mr. Siegel.
Mr. SIEGEL. I think that not only does EPA have the capacity but
I  think  that  the  other  agencies—there  are  a  lot  of  good  people  at
the  Department  of  Defense  who  are  trying  to  do  good  science  too
and they are capable of communicating with EPA and EPA is capa-
ble  of  communicating  back,  and  the  OIRA  involvement  to  me
smacks of a political involvement, that you have people who are in-
volved  not  primarily  because  of  their  scientific  expertise  but  be-
cause of their political obligations.

THE IRIS PROCESS

Chairman MILLER. My time is expired, but Mr. Sensenbrenner is
not here so I will recognize myself for a second round of questions.
Mr.  Whittaker,  I  think  you  are  the  audiovisual  guy.  There  were
two  charts  in  the  hearing  last  week.  Chart  3,  that  is—actually
could I see Chart 1 first? All right. That chart based on Susan Dud-
ley’s  testimony  last  week  is  the  very  complicated  process.  That  is
actually  prepared  by  the  EPA  and  it  is  the  flow  chart  to  show  the
IRIS  process,  which  she—before  2004,  and  then  there  was  an  in-
terim  one  and  then  Chart  3,  Mr.  Whittaker,  that  is  the  chart  that
she  said  streamlined  the  IRIS  process.  Mr.  Siegel,  does  that—is  it
your  impression  like  GAO’s  that  that  actually  will  further  com-
plicate,  not  streamline  it?  It  does  not  look  just  to  my  own  lying
eyes to be a simplification of the earlier chart.

Mr.  SIEGEL.  As  I  said,  you  know,  there  are  a  lot  of  good  people
at  EPA  and  career  people  I  talk  to,  you  know,  are  very  concerned
about  this  sort  of  thing,  and  I  tease  them.  I  say  it  takes  the  EPA
30 days to put in a light bulb, and basically you have that not just
with  IRIS  but  with  a  large  number  of  processes,  things  just  drag
on and on while people are already exposed. It is one thing if there
is a delay and nobody is being exposed but you basically have peo-
ple  like  Shirley,  like  Janey  Ensminger,  people  who  are  being  ex-
posed  while  this  is  being—this  process  goes  on.  So  again,  things
that  take  a  long  time  that  are  complicated  are  okay  if  people  are
safe,  but  if  you  don’t  know  that  they  are  safe,  you  need  to  act
quickly, and when we have tried to accelerate some of these studies

like  on  perchlorate,  they  say,  we  can’t  possibly  do  it  by  such  and
such  a  date.  Well,  I  guess  that  is  because  they  don’t  really  care
about  the  exposures  that  are  going  on.  That  is  all  I  can  think  of.
Chairman  MILLER.  Mr.  Ensminger,  you  appear  to  want  to  com-

ment.

Master  Sergeant  ENSMINGER.  I  had  a  researcher  make  the  com-
ment  to  me  the  other  day  exactly  about  OMB  overruling  the  EPA.
I believe the OMB has one toxicologist on their staff.

Chairman  MILLER.  I  asked  Susan  Dudley  that  last  week  and  I

did not get a clear answer.

Master Sergeant ENSMINGER. They have one toxicologist on their
staff  who  overruled  the  thousands  that  work  at  EPA.  Boy,  isn’t
that something?

Chairman  MILLER.  Well,  again,  what  you  just  said  is  consistent
with what I had heard. When I asked Susan Dudley that, the head
of  OIRA,  I  did  not  seem  to  get  a  clear  answer  and  she  said  that
they had access to other expertise that they employed.

Master Sergeant ENSMINGER. And Mr. Siegel made a comment a
while  ago  about  the  DOD  had  good  researchers  on  their  staff  as
well. Why are we duplicating these efforts? Why is DOD authorized
to use taxpayers’ money to do research on these chemicals when we
are  already  funding  somebody  else  to  do  it,  the  EPA?  I  mean,  this
is  ludicrous.  Is  it  the  Department  of  Defense  or  is  it  the  Depart-
ment of Legal Defense?

Chairman  MILLER.  When  Susan  Dudley  testified  last  week,  I
asked  her  if  in  any  of  these  old  mini  blocks,  I  haven’t  actually
counted how many blocks there are, other than the public comment
section  periods,  whether  there  was  an  opportunity  for  anyone  in
the  private  sector  to  be  part  of  deliberative  discussions  and  obvi-
ously  public  comment  is  not  a  deliberative  discussion  or  secretive,
as I am sure you would say, and I would too, and she said no, that
actually  all  the  participation  by  the  private  sector  would  be
through  public  comment.  There  was  no  opportunity  for  them  to
have  any  say,  any  opportunity  to  influence  an  IRIS  decision,  an
IRIS  assessment,  not  TCE  manufacturers,  not  any  private  sector
companies  that  might  face  clean-up  costs,  no  opportunity  except
during  public  comment.  Mr.  Siegel,  is  that  consistent  with  your
own observations of the process?

Mr. SIEGEL. It is my understanding that through the perchlorate
study group, and you may have the documents, that the contractors
for  these  federal  polluting  agencies  have  a  direct  line  to  the  De-
fense  Department,  NASA  participants  because  these  agencies  end
up  in  many  cases  paying  for  the  clean-up  of  the  contractor  obliga-
tions. I mean, it is little known, when Congress looked at this over
10  years  ago,  that  companies  like  Lockheed  and  Aerojet  charged
the costs of their clean-up off as overhead on their government con-
tracts and the people in the Defense Department who are in charge
of  dealing  with  it,  know  it  so  they  are  very  open  to  input  from
these  companies  when  they  go  to  EPA.  I  don’t  know  that  the  com-
panies  are  actually  in  the  room  in  the  meetings  with  EPA,  but
their information is.

Chairman MILLER. Dr. Greer.
Dr. GREER. Yes, that is right. I was going to say the same thing,
that the perchlorate study group is a great example of how that is

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 22:03 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042370 PO 00000 Frm 00088 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O08\052108\42370A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

203

really  not  the  case,  that  what  Susan  Dudley  was  talking  about,
there  is  plenty  of  precedent  for  that  not  being  true.  You  know,  in
this  case,  that  was  a  group  set  up  by  the  military.  They  were
present  in  the  so-called  interagency  deliberations,  and  Aerojet  was
actually the chair of the deliberations in many of the meeting notes
that  NRDC  has.  So  they  were  running  the  deliberation,  let  alone
not present.

Chairman  MILLER.  Dr.  Greer,  if  there  were  not  this  streamlined
process, interagency IRIS process, could federal agencies still weigh
in on an IRIS assessment and how would they go about that?

Dr. GREER. Well, you know, federal agencies have always had an
opportunity  to  comment  and  weigh  in  on  these  assessments.  That
has  been  the  case  all  the  time.  They  have  weighed  in  during  the
public  comment  period  but  not  in  secret  and,  you  know,  not  with
a  license  to  kill.  That  is  the  big  difference  between  what  we  are
looking  at  today  and  the  normal  procedures.  We  certainly  would
not  object  to  having  these  agencies  weigh  in  with  the  public,  you
know, on the record, so to speak.

Mr.  SIEGEL.  You  know,  one  of  the  things  that  I  wonder  is  what
these  agencies,  polluting  agencies  say  in  private  versus  what  they
are actually saying in public, that we have no way of knowing that.

TRACKING CITIZEN EXPOSURE TO TCE

Chairman  MILLER.  Mr.  Ensminger,  obviously  a  lot  of  folks  have
lived on Camp Lejeune. The military is transient by nature. I grew
up  in  Fayetteville.  As  you  pointed  out  when  we  talked  yesterday,
I know you have less than warm feelings for Fayetteville since you
see it as an Army town. I know that people are on and off of mili-
tary bases, their families are on and off military bases all the time,
and  keeping  track  of  all  the  people  who  have  been  exposed  is  no
small  task.  How  is  the  government  doing  in  identifying  the  people
who  have  been  exposed  and  trying  to  see  what  health  outcomes
they  have  had,  whether  they  have  had  health  consequences  that
are consistent with the TCE exposure risk?

Master  Sergeant  ENSMINGER.  To  answer  your  question,  Mr.
Chairman, to date, to date, there have been no studies done on any
population  groups  at  Camp  Lejeune  other  than  the  in  utero  popu-
lation. In other words, the siblings of those in utero children, their
parents, the men and women who were stationed at Camp Lejeune,
the  Marines  and  sailors,  and  the  civilian  employees  that  work
aboard  the  base,  to  date,  no  studies  have  been  done  on  them.  Try-
ing to get the Department of Defense, Department of the Navy and
the  United  States  Marine  Corps  to  execute  a  notification  process,
actually  had  to  go  to  the  extreme  of  getting  an  amendment  to  the
Defense  Authorization  bill  through  the  Senate  last  year  to  force
them to live up to their own motto, which is semper fidelis, always
faithful.

SCIENCE POLICY

Chairman  MILLER.  When  Dr.  Gray  of  the  EPA,  the  official  who
seems  to  be  in  charge  of  IRIS,  and  Ms.  Dudley  from  OMB,  from
OIRA  appeared  last  week,  they,  particularly  Dr.  Gray,  used  the
phrase that IRIS includes both science and science policy. I pushed

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 22:03 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042370 PO 00000 Frm 00089 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O08\052108\42370A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

him  some  on  exactly  what  he  meant  by  science  policy  and  I  think
most  people  would  think  that  science  policy  was  just  part  of
science.  Occam’s  razor,  for  instance,  appears  to  be  science  policy
rather  than  strictly  science.  Dr.  Greer,  can  you  give  us  some  idea
of what elements of a policy might be in an IRIS listing?

Dr.  GREER.  Yes.  So,  you  know,  there  is  a  mixture  of  science  and
some decisions that I would call policy decisions in an IRIS assess-
ment.  For  example,  deciding  whether  the  data  has  enough  cer-
tainty  to  negate  the  need  for  a  safety  factor  or  deciding  whether
or  not  a  certain  study  shows  that  there  really  is  disproportionate
vulnerability  in  a  certain  type  of  population.  I  think  the  key  thing
here though to focus on is that those policy decisions are best made
by  relying  on  existing  EPA  guidance  documents  because  the  key
here is consistency. The key here is consistency and how you make
those  decisions  so  that  you  get  objective,  clear  and  health-protec-
tive  decisions,  and  those  guidance  documents  are  publicly  vetted,
publicly  commented  on  and  open,  and  so  what  I  get  worried  about
in  this  distinction  between  science  and  policy  is  that  we  lose  the
plot  here,  that  the  plot  here  is  how  to  make  consistent  decisions
that  err  on  the  side  of  protecting  public  health  and  that  is  not
about  individual  analysts  or  even  the  boss,  George  Gray,  inserting
his own personal opinion on how he thinks something ought to go.
That is about following the rules of the road that EPA has in those
longstanding documents.

Mr. SIEGEL. May I add something?
Chairman MILLER. Mr. Siegel.
Mr.  SIEGEL.  One  of  the  innovative  things  in  the  TCE  human
health  risk  assessment,  the  draft  for  2001,  is  that  it  incorporated
cumulative  exposures  because  as  you  are  exposed  to  other  similar
chemicals to TCE or even alcohol can enhance the impact of the ex-
posure  and  the  scientists  who  led  that  study  explained  it  to  me
with an analogy of taxes. If you make zero dollars a year and then
all  of  a  sudden  you  make  $5,000  more,  your  taxes  don’t  really  go
up.  You  barely  pay  any  taxes  anyhow.  But  if  you  start  out  at
$100,000  and  you  go  to  $105,000,  your  taxes  might  go  up  a  couple
thousand  dollars,  and  the  same  is  true  with  the  body.  If  you  al-
ready  have  a  load  of  exposure  to  chemicals  that  affect  the  kidney
or  affect  the  liver  or  various  parts  of  the  body  and  it  goes  up,  it
has  an  impact.  The  2001  human  health  risk  assessment  incor-
porated that. That is a policy decision. Some people argue the other
side  and  say  no,  we  should  address  that  at  the  risk  management
stage when we decide whether or not to treat the well, to treat the
air,  something  like  that.  That  is  a  viable  argument.  It  is  a  policy
debate. Unfortunately, I don’t know of any place where that cumu-
lative  exposure  is  addressed  at  the  risk  management  stage.  So  I
think I would go with the 2001 health risk assessment and say yes,
we  should  do  it  in  the  risk  assessment  phase  and  that  should  be
part  of  IRIS.  But  that  is  a  policy  decision  that  affects  how  the
science comes out.

this.

Chairman  MILLER.  Mr.  Ensminger,  you  seem  to  want  to  answer

Master  Sergeant  ENSMINGER.  No,  I  wanted  to  go  back  to  that
thing  about  the  studies.  Now,  there  are  some  feasibility  studies
that  have  been  proposed  by  ATSDR  for  some  of  these  other  popu-

lation groups. The protocols have just been written for them. They
are  in  the  peer  review  process  now  and  approval  process  but  like
I  said  in  my  testimony,  just  the  week  before  last,  the  Department
of  Defense  and  Department  of  the  Navy  were  balking  at  $1.6  mil-
lion  and  ATSDR  is  estimating  that  next  year’s  feasibility  studies
and their water modeling at Camp Lejeune is going to come some-
where  close  to  $12  million.  I  can  just  hear  them  now,  that,  you
know, they are doing everything they can to kill the Camp Lejeune
efforts  and  they  are  going  to  use  every  excuse  in  this  world  to
make that possible, but I will be here fighting them.
ASSESSING CUMULATIVE EXPOSURES

Chairman  MILLER.  Mr.  Ensminger,  I  want  to  come  back  to  you
in  just  a  second  on  your  experience  with  ATSDR,  which  has  also
gotten  the  Subcommittee’s  attention.  But  Mr.  Siegel  and  I  think
Dr.  Greer,  Mr.  Ensminger  has  obviously  done  a  good  deal  of  re-
search  and  it  is  obvious  what  his  motivation  is  from  having  heard
his testimony, that the typical expectation for a population the size
of  the  children  who  were  exposed  in  utero  would  have  been  7.2
cases, and ATSDR has now confirmed 14 to this point of childhood
leukemia, two cases of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. That is more than
twice  what  would  be  expected,  but  Mr.  Siegel,  your  discussion  of
the  cumulative  effect,  is  that—is  it  likely  that  that  baseline  does
include  a  fair  number  of  folks  whose  leukemia  is  a  result  of  envi-
ronmental exposures? Did that question make sense?

Mr. SIEGEL. Yes. I mean, basically it is very difficult to show, un-
less  you  have  a  specific  disease  like  mesothelioma—I  can’t  pro-
nounce that one.

Chairman  MILLER.  We  have  Dr.  Greer  here  to  pronounce  every-

thing for us.

Mr.  SIEGEL.  There  are  some  specific  diseases  that  have  finger-
prints. Most diseases are not caused by a single exposure to a sin-
gle chemical and so it is very difficult to show that the particular—
even  in  Janey’s  case,  it  is  difficult  to  show  that  that  particular  ex-
posure caused the disease but we know that if we know something
about  the  exposures,  that  it  was  probably  a  very  major  percentage
of the cause, not just—you know, but if there were other exposures,
that  would  have  also  increased  it,  and  the  problem—we  have  a
problem,  a  burden  of  proof  in  this  country,  and  I  will  give  you  an
example. A man I met in Kentucky earlier this year where he was
one  of  the  key  subjects  in  a  study  by  the  University  of  Kentucky
which  showed  that  there  is  a  relationship  between  TCE  and
Parkinsonism, and he was obviously very sick and the woman who
was with him wasn’t exposed as much and she wasn’t quite as sick
and they used this for this very well, you know, regarded published
scientific  study,  and  that  is  great,  you  know,  that  they  can  show
that  there  is—that  TCE  is  a  factor  in  Parkinsonism.  They  told  me
that the doctor who did the study on him, that included him, would
not  certify  for  his  purpose  of  workers’  compensation  that  he  was
sick  because  of  that  exposure  and  so  with  all  the  studying  that  is
going  on  and  a  lot  of  scientists  are,  you  know,  getting  awards  and
degrees  and  all  kinds  of  stuff  for  doing  it,  but  the  problem  I  have
is that the studies go on and they don’t end up helping people and
that is something that needs to be addressed.

Chairman  MILLER.  Dr.  Greer,  I  guess  my  question  was,  is  there
reason  to  think  that  the  baseline  is  not  actually  a  clean  baseline
that  assumes  no  environment  exposures  but  may  in  fact  the  base-
line be the result of, in some part, to some extent of environmental
exposures?

Dr.  GREER.  Yeah,  I  mean  to  some  extent,  you  know  what  they
try  to  do  is  compare  against  a  control  population  that  looks  the
same  about  everything  except  the  exposure  of  concern,  but  I  will
tell  you  that  an  environmental  epi  study  that  shows  twice  as  high
as  expected  is  very  alarming.  I  mean,  two  times  as  high  is  a  high
rate for an environmental epi study, and the reason for that is be-
cause unlike laboratory animals that you control every single thing
that they are exposed to, people are exposed to a lot of things. Peo-
ple  smoke  and  people  have  other  diseases,  et  cetera,  et  cetera.  So
when you are comparing a disease caused by an environmental ex-
posure with a baseline of disease, it is sort of muddy and you have
a hard time seeing trends. Two times is high for an environmental
study and would certainly be a red flag for most environmental epi-
demiologists  as,  you  know,  something  that  looks  like  a  real  con-
cern.

THE AGENCY FOR TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND DISEASE

REGISTRY (ATSDR)

Chairman MILLER. Mr. Ensminger, you mentioned ATSDR is in-
volved  in  this.  ATSDR  is  an  agency  of  the  Federal  Government  I
had  never  heard  of  a  year  ago.  The  Agency  for  Toxic  Substances
and  Disease  Registry  is  part  of  the  CDC,  the  Centers  for  Disease
Control.  They  were  involved  in  the  FEMA  trailers,  the,  I  guess,
hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  who  were  living  in  trailers  pro-
vided  by  FEMA  as  a  result  of  being  victims  of  Katrina,  being  dis-
placed  by  Katrina  and  Rita.  Mr.  Sensenbrenner  mentioned  that  in
his opening remarks, that we had had a hearing on FEMA trailers
and  formaldehyde  exposure.  The  formaldehyde  was  used  in  those
trailers  as  a  very  cheap  building  material,  an  adhesive  that  held
together  particleboard  that  was  used  for  walls  and  flooring  and
cabinets  and  that  since  1997  the  IRIS  assessment  process  has  had
before  them  a  reassessment  of  formaldehyde  that  EPA  has  yet  to
act upon. With a fairly active effort to influence the process by the
industry, our impression of ATSDR was that they were entirely too
eager  to  please  FEMA.  FEMA  asked  ATSDR  for  a  health  assess-
ment.  It  obviously  would  not  have  done  them  a  lot  of  good  to  go
to  IRIS  to  find  out  what  the  effect  of  formaldehyde  was,  and
ATSDR  provided  a  health  assessment  that  they  knew  was  not  ap-
propriate  to  the  circumstances  because  they  were  trying  to  please
FEMA,  give  FEMA  what  they  wanted.  What  has  been  your  own
impression of ATSDR from your dealing with them?

Master  Sergeant  ENSMINGER.  Well,  specifically—and  ATSDR  is
many,  many  different  departments,  several  different  departments.
Their largest department is the Department of Health Assessments
and  Consultations.  For  lack  of  a  better  term,  the  public  health  as-
sessment for Camp Lejeune is a piece of crap, okay.

Chairman MILLER. Could you put that in lay terms?
Master  Sergeant  ENSMINGER.  They—and  there  are  so  many  er-
rors in that public health assessment, and every one of those errors

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 22:03 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042370 PO 00000 Frm 00092 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O08\052108\42370A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

207

have been pointed out to those people. And they absolutely refused
to pull that health assessment down and correct it.

Last  year,  there  was  a  hearing  held  specifically  about  Camp
Lejeune,  and  we  almost  had  to  beat  them  into  submission  just  to
get  them  to  put  a  disclaimer  up  at  the  beginning  of  that  public
health assessment so people weren’t looking at that thing and rely-
ing  on  the  erroneous  information  that  they  have  on  their  website.
Now,  public  health  assessments  and  consultations  with  ATSDR,
when  we  discussed  this  yesterday  with  some  of  your  staff,  ATSDR
was  given  an  exception  when  they  were  created  back  in  the  early
’80s  to  bypass  the  peer  review  process  because  of  the  backlog  in
Superfund  sites  that  they  needed  to  do  assessments  on.  So  Con-
gress gave them a pass on the peer review process for public health
assessments.  That  backlog  is  done.  There  is  no  backlog  for  Super-
fund sites anymore. ATSDR needs to be held to the same standard
as  everybody  else  and  those  public  health  assessments  need  to  go
through  a  peer  review  process.  And  I  will  guarantee  you,  if  this  is
instituted,  you  will  see  a  much  better  product  coming  out  of
ATSDR than you see now.

Matter of fact, I would make the—I would bet you that there are
a  lot  of  people  working  at  ATSDR  who  are  so  used  to  pulling  out
their  little  tray  in  their  desk  that  got  all  their  little  standard
quotes  that  they  can  just  slip  in  there  and  nobody  ever  questions.
I bet you if you make them go through the peer review process you
will see a lot of people that work at ATSDR that won’t be working
there later.

Chairman  MILLER.  Mr.  Siegel  or  Dr.  Greer,  do  you  have  any  ex-

perience with ATSDR?

Mr.  SIEGEL.  Well,  you  know,  when  I  visit  a  community  that  has
just found out about contamination in their water there, everybody
wants  a  health  study.  Often  that  means  bringing  in  ATSDR.  But
ATSDR’s batting average is very low. They almost never find, with
their  methodology,  with  the  burden  of  proof,  that  people  are  sick
as a result of environmental exposures.

I  would  ask  them,  you  know,  how  many  times  out  of  all  the
health assessments that you have done, have you found that there
is a direct link between the exposure and disease? And the problem
is,  to  me,  with  their  methodology,  and  their  methodology  may  be
good  for  some  purposes,  but  not  for  the  purpose  that  they  have
been assigned, you know, to help guide risk management decisions
at these sites.

Unless  you  believe  that  people  really  don’t  get  sick  as  a  result
of  exposures  to  these  chemicals,  and  there  are  people  who  believe
that, in which case, ATSDR’s batting average is very good. But al-
most—friends  of  mine  wrote  a  report,  ‘‘Inconclusive  by  Design,’’  20
years ago about ATSDR, and the same is true today.

Chairman MILLER. Dr. Greer, anything?
Dr.  GREER.  Well,  as  I  said  in  my  oral  statement,  you  know,  the
changes  to  the  IRIS  program  that  we  were  talking  about  are  just
part of what we regard as the Administration’s war on science and
public health protection, and I think ATSDR is another—is an area
which  shows  the  influence  of  the  Administration  on  some  of  their
deliberations.

208

It is true, actually, that ATSDR is sometimes inconclusive by de-
sign.  What  we  urge  them  strongly  to  do  is  if  they  are  going  into
a  community  where  they  know  that  it  is  a  small  community  and
statistics will not allow them to ever find something significant, be-
cause  there  just  are  not  enough  people  to  study,  that  they  should
say  that  it  is  scientifically  not  possible  to  do  a  study,  rather  than
going in and doing a study and saying we didn’t find anything sta-
tistically  significant,  which  sounds  like  there  is  nothing  wrong
here.

So  they  really  need  to  develop  a  bright  line  threshold  that  they
make  an  evaluation  at  the  outset  to  say  is  there  enough  people  or
enough  type  of  disease  here  that  we  could  actually  study  this  sci-
entifically,  or  this  doesn’t  lend  itself  to  a  scientific  study  and  we
need to make a decision to move forward, erring on the side of pro-
tecting human health, to do it without the study. And that is what
we have urged upon them many times without success.

Chairman MILLER. Mr. Ensminger.
Master  Sergeant  ENSMINGER.  Also,  the  researchers  at  ATSDR—
now,  I  am  going  to  take  their  side  for  a  minute  here,  which  is  un-
usual,  but  ATSDR’s  researchers,  when  they  go  to  a  DOD  site  spe-
cifically,  all  the  information  gathering  for  their  health  assess-
ment—DOD  Superfund  sites  are  placed  on  an  honor  system.  They
are  on  an  honor  system.  These  people  are  the  keepers  of  all  the
records  on  that—for  that  base,  and  these  researchers  are  literally
thrown  to  these  wolves  when  they  go  to  these  bases  and  have  to
rely  on  these  people.  These  people  withhold—I  mean,  I  have  got
letters  that  I  provided  with  my  testimony  back  in  1994  where
ATSDR  was  complaining  that  the  people  at  Camp  Lejeune  weren’t
providing  them  with  the  documents  they  needed  to  do  their  re-
quired  mission.  And  when  they  did  provide  them  with  data,  there
was no supporting documentation to back up what they were giving
them.

I  mean,  how  can  you  place  a  polluter  on  an  honor  system?  They
have  already  shown  they  don’t  have  any  honor,  and  they  have
proven it time and time again in the Camp Lejeune situation, drag-
ging  their  feet,  putting  up  road  blocks,  stalling,  giving  incorrect
data.  And  I  have  documented  situations  at  Camp  Lejeune  where
they  knowingly  provided  incorrect  data  to  ATSDR,  which  skewed
one  of  their  studies,  and  never  corrected.  They  relied  on  us  to  cor-
rect it.

Chairman MILLER. We are getting short on time, and Mr. Siegel?
Mr. SIEGEL. This is a systemic problem. ATSDR does not do stud-
ies. They take data that is provided to them by the polluter, some-
times by the regulator which really doesn’t do its own studies, and
they  do  an  assessment.  But  they  do  not  generate  any  new  data.
They don’t go out and do sampling, they don’t go out and interview
people like a university study would do. They just take the existing
data  and  make  a  judgment  based  upon  it,  which  in  my  experi-
ence—that  is  what  I  have  seen.  Somebody  may  know  more  about
it, but that is generally the way they operate when they are asked
to conduct a public health assessment.

THE EUROPEAN REACH PROGRAM

Chairman  MILLER.  This  probably  needs  to  be  a  final  question,
but this morning when I rolled out of bed and walked down to the
corner  to  get  the  Washington  Post  thinking  of  today’s  hearing,
there  was  an  article  on  the  front  page  on  a  decision  by  the  Euro-
pean Union that has been adamantly opposed by the Bush Admin-
istration  and  the  chemical  industry  that  would  take  a  fundamen-
tally  different  approach  to  regulating  chemicals  that  may  be  toxic.
What  we  have  been  talking  about  today  is  just  the  very  initial
stages  of  a  regulatory  process  before  cost  benefit  analysis,  for  in-
stance,  is  supposed  to  be  taken  into  effect.  Just  assessing  which
chemicals have what toxic effect, and in this case, we can see that
two assessments are coming out when 600 new chemicals enter the
marketplace  a  year.  TCE,  which  appears  to  cause  a  great  deal  of
damage, has taken 20 years, formaldehyde, 11 years and counting.
This  hearing  has  been  about  how  to  fix  that  IRIS  assessment
process,  but  Mr.  Siegel,  Dr.  Greer,  do  you  think  maybe  our  funda-
mental  approach  should  be  different?  EU,  by  the  way,  is  500  mil-
lion  people  in  developed  economies.  We  are  300  million  people  in
a  developed  economy.  It  is  hard  to  imagine  that  industry  will  sim-
ply  stop  producing  goods  from  the  European  market,  which  is  sig-
nificantly two-thirds, again, the size of our economy.

Mr. Siegel.
Mr.  SIEGEL.  The  short  answer  is  yes.  I  mean,  I  have  actually
been  to  a  Defense  Department-sponsored  meeting  with  their  con-
tractors  where  the  European  approach,  the  REACH  program  has
been  presented.  And  very  clearly,  with  the  Defense  contractors,
they  are  already  finding  that  they  are  changing  their  practices,
phasing  out  certain  uses  of  chemicals  like  chromium,  because  of
their  need  to  market  globally.  American  companies  are  at  a  com-
petitive  disadvantage  if  they  do  not  recognize  this  new  approach.
But  unless,  you  know,  the  American  Defense  Department  adjusts
its specifications, which would actually require the use of toxic sub-
stances, it will be limited.

But  this  is  definitely—you  know,  it  is  being  heard,  it  is  being
felt,  and  it  would  be  so  easy  for  the  U.S.—I  mean,  the  imple-
menting  would  be  hard,  would  take  a  while,  but  it  would  be  so
easy,  so  helpful  to  put  the  burden  of  proof  on  the  people  who  are
using these toxic substances, rather than on the people who are the
victims, that there is a problem.
Chairman MILLER. Dr. Greer.
Dr. GREER. Well, you know, we Americans really like to think of
ourselves  as  number  one,  and  at  the  head  of  the  pack  globally  on
so  many  things,  but  I  have  to  tell  you  that  Europe  is  far  ahead  of
us  on  these  issues  of  public  health  protection  and  environmental
contaminants.  And  the  REACH  program  really  has  a  tremendous
amount  of  promise.  I  mean,  it  sort  of  takes—you  know,  here  a
chemical  is  innocent  until  proven  guilty,  and  you  see  how  long  it
takes to get proven one way or the other. Under their new system,
a chemical is going to be guilty until proven innocent; that is, data
is going to be required before a chemical can get on the market so
that we don’t get this big bad backlog. And of course, the incentive

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 22:03 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042370 PO 00000 Frm 00095 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O08\052108\42370A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

210

will  be  to  get  that  information  forward,  because  they  want  to  put
it on the market.

So  it  is  a  really  smart  idea.  I  think  because  we  are  in  such  a
global  economy,  we  may  be  the  accidental  beneficiaries  of  a  lot  of
that  work  because  when  global  companies  need  to  make  certain
products,  the  European  standards  are  going  to  be  higher  than  the
American standards, and they probably will benefit from that. But
you  know,  we  have  had  our  feet  in  cement  shoes  for  almost  a  dec-
ade  now  on  these  toxic  chemical  issues,  and  we  have  got  our  work
cut out for us to get back to where some of these colleagues in the
other developed countries have really been on this scientifically.

Chairman  MILLER.  It  seems  unlikely  they  will  produce  two

versions of their product——

Dr. GREER. Exactly.
Chairman  MILLER.—so  the  safe  European  version  and  the  toxic

American version.

Mr.  Ensminger,  do  you  have  any  thoughts  on  it?  You  don’t  have
to  have  any  thoughts  on  this,  you  have  had  thoughts  on  a  lot  of
things.

Master  Sergeant  ENSMINGER.  I  do.  Well,  basically  the  European
Union  is  concerned  about  their  people.  It  makes  you  wonder  what
our government is concerned about. Is it people or money?

Chairman  MILLER.  That  is  a  pretty  good  valedictory  statement

from the witnesses.

I  want  to  thank  all  of  you  for  appearing  today  for  this  hearing.
Under  the  rules  of  the  Committee—the  Subcommittee,  the  record
will be open for an additional two weeks for any Member to submit
additional statements and any additional questions that could go to
you for written response.

The hearing is now adjourned. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF DAVID G. HOEL

MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA

CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA

Discussion of EPA’s IRIS and the Health Effects of

Trichloroethylene

I  am  a  University  Distinguished  Professor  in  the  Department  of  Biostatistics,
Bioinformatics  and  Epidemiology  at  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina  in
Charleston.  Prior  to  joining  the  University,  I  was  employed  for  over  twenty  years
at  the  National  Institute  of  Environmental  Health  Sciences  of  the  National  Insti-
tutes of Health.

There  I  was  Director  of  the  Division  of  Risk  Assessment,  and  served  for  a  time
as  Acting  Scientific  Director  of  the  Intramural  Research  Program.  I  was  a  member
of  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency’s  scientific  panels  for  perchlorate  and  for
trichloroethylene  (TCE).  I  was  a  peer  reviewer  of  the  National  Research  Council’s
report on TCE.

The opinions I state today are my own.
I will comment on the general process used by EPA (e.g., IRIS) for calculating per-
missible  dose  levels  of  environmental  carcinogens  with  a  focus  on  the  example  of
TCE. I will conclude with a few recommendations.
• EPA 2001 TCE Report

The  EPA  2001  TCE  risk  assessment  had  a  number  of  shortcomings  that  were
pointed out by individual scientists and EPA’s Scientific Advisory Board’s TCE Advi-
sory Panel. Although there were several health endpoints under consideration, can-
cer  is  the  predominant  outcome  used  for  exposure  standard  setting.  This  is  due  in
part  to  the  target  of  one  in  a  million  lifetime  cancer  risk,  and  the  assumption  of
a linear no threshold dose-response for carcinogens. It should be noted that the NRC
report  discussed  this  assumption  and  the  need  to  validate  it.  The  usual  method  for
estimating cancer risk was applied to TCE. Basically, a few selected epidemiological
studies and a few high dose rodent studies were individually fit to a linear dose re-
sponse  function  in  order  to  estimate  the  dose  which  would  correspond  to  a  lifetime
risk  of  one  in  a  million.  Figure  1  is  a  reproduction  of  a  graph  of  the  results  of  this
process  taken  from  the  EPA  draft  report,  with  Table  1  giving  the  numbers  used  in
Figure 1.

First  there  is  a  question  of  the  selection  of  epidemiological  studies  used  for  this

process.

EPA  used  three  studies:  Henschler  (1995)  kidney  cancers  among  workers  in  a
German  cardboard  factory,  Anttila  (1995)  Finnish  workers  who  were  monitored  for
TSE (kidney, liver and NHL) and an ecological study of drinking water in New Jer-
sey (NHL).

The  data  from  animal  studies  was  also  treated  in  a  manner  similar  to  human
studies.  Using  kidney  cancer  as  the  primary  example,  EPA  gave  three  dose  esti-
mates.  They  were  derived  from  the  rat  study,  the  German  worker  study  and  the
Finnish worker study. EPA calculated the dose estimates to be (see Table 1).

This represents a range in estimated dose by a factor of almost 10,000, suggesting
that  the  process  is  so  variable  as  to  be  meaningless.  It  should  be  noted  that  the
most  extreme  result  produced  by  EPA  was  from  the  Finnish  study,  which  was  not
statistically  significant,  and  the  workers  had  fewer  kidney  tumors  than  were  ex-
pected. It is not clear why this study was included in the analysis.

Multiple  studies  are  often  quantitatively  combined  using  meta  analysis  or  joint
data  analysis  techniques.  A  meta-analysis  was  carried  out  by  EPA  (Wartenberg  et
al.,  2000),  but  not  used  in  the  calculating  cancer  risk.  The  specific  TCE  application

has  been  criticized  in  the  scientific  literature  and  most  recently  by  the  NRC  2006
report. If done correctly, with consideration of exposure, as has been done with radi-
ation  and  cancer  (e.g.,  Lubin  and  Boice,  1997),  one  could  avoid  using  selected  stud-
ies  and  their  less  stable  risk  estimates.  Further  Bayesian  statistical  methods  can
adjust  for  exposure  uncertainties  which  vary  among  studies.  The  NRC  report  gives
very detailed recommendations concerning the meta analysis process.

I feel that without a considerably more sophisticated analysis, which does not se-
lectively  choose  individual  studies  and  treat  them  independently,  the  low-exposure
cancer risk estimates in EPA 2001 are unreliable and should not be used to set en-
vironmental standards.
• NRC 2006 TCE Report

The NRC (2006) report on TCE recommended that low dose cancer risk estimates
be  based  on  rodent  bioassays  and  human  data  be  used  as  validation  of  the  rodent
studies. This is a reasonable approach, which I support. The human epidemiological
data  is  thought  to  be  preferable  but  the  very  large  uncertainty  of  exposures  plus
the  confounding  of  other  chemical  exposures,  as  well  as  lifestyle  issues,  greatly  de-
creases the value of the data for quantitative risk estimation.

Basic  toxicological  research  focuses  on  a  compound’s  mode  of  action  (MOA);  that
is, how it and its metabolites affect the carcinogenesis process. Also, the use of phys-
iologically  based  pharmacokinetic  models  (PBPK)  to  evaluate  the  relationship  be-
tween routes of exposure and the formation of reactive metabolites of interest is crit-
ical  to  quantitative  risk  estimation.  This  information,  although  discussed,  was  not
incorporated into the EPA cancer risk models. This PBPK model information, along
with  MOA  understanding,  is  key  to  evaluating  the  validity  of  the  predictability  of
rodent cancer effects to man. The NRC report discusses these important issues and
makes specific research recommendations for improved TCE risk estimation.

An issue of increasing concern is the variability in response by various susceptible
human  subgroups.  This  is  frequently  discussed  but  rarely  employed  in  evaluating
the  degree  of  sensitivity  in  subgroups.  These  subgroups  include  age,  medical  condi-
tions and genetic variability. For example, Bronley-Delancey et al. (2007) measured
the  variability  of  TCE  metabolism  by  genetic  subgroups  by  using  human
hepatocytes.  This  basic  type  of  human  data  provides  guidance  on  possible  adjust-
ments of environmental exposure levels for genetic subgroups in the population.

All  of  this  is  important  applied  science  which  is  essential  to  quality  risk  esti-

mation, but it suffers from two problems.

First,  the  risk  assessors  are  not  integrating  enough  scientific  information  into
their actual cancer risk estimates. There are modern statistical methods for accom-
plishing  this.  The  ongoing  effort  in  radiation  carcinogenesis  is  one  area  where  re-
analysis is performed as new, better methods are developed, and it is a good exam-
ple of scientific responsiveness to innovation.

The  second  issue  is  that  there  are  no  longer  effective  government  programs  di-
rected  at  solving  these  issues  through  academic  research.  This  work  is  too  applied
for NIH (i.e., NIH’s toxicology grant study section no longer exists) and other agen-
cies are not focused on these issues. Considering the cost of inappropriate risk esti-
mates,  in  either  dollars  or  health  effects,  this  seems  foolish  from  a  societal  view-
point.

Finally,  EPA’s  IRIS  process  involves  both  risk  estimation  and  risk  management.
EPA should consider using outside scientific experts to carry-out the risk estimation.
This is done successfully by WHO’s IARC for qualitative risk assessment of chemical
carcinogens  and  by  the  NRC  for  quantitative  risk  estimation  of  various  radiation
types. Through the use of independent scientific experts and a rigorous peer review
process  these  risk  estimates  are  considered  authoritative.  Some  30  years  ago  EPA
had  the  NRC  develop  quantitative  cancer  risk  estimates  for  chemical  contaminants
in drinking water. The Agency could then use exposure levels and the NRC risk es-
timates to establish standards based upon risks and benefits.

Conclusions and Recommendations

• EPA  must  develop  cancer  risk  estimates  for  TCE  using  an  integrated  ap-
proach  following  the  advice  of  the  SAB  Panel  and  the  NRC  Committee.  Fur-
ther,  it  should  focus  on  the  best  estimate  of  risk,  including  an  estimated  un-
certainty.  EPA  should  also  seriously  consider  the  NRC’s  recommendation  of
developing  the  risk  estimates  based  upon  the  animal  and  laboratory  studies
and using the human studies as validation of their risk models.
• While  developing  risk  estimates,  EPA  should  consider  obtaining  quality  out-
side  scientific  advice  before  and  during  the  process,  instead  of  waiting  until
the document is completed. EPA should consider having risk assessment, but

not risk management, for the more important chemicals carried out by a com-
mittee of outside experts. The National Academies’ NRC is well suited for this
purpose.

• EPA and other governmental agencies should sponsor extramurally the devel-
opment and refinement of risk assessment methodology in general. Also, they
should  support  key  laboratory  and  human  studies  directed  at  specific  prob-
lems associated with any major chemical problem, such as TCE.

• Greater attention must be given to potentially sensitive subgroups and to ad-

verse health outcomes other than cancer.
