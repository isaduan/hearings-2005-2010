HEARING CHARTER

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Bridge Safety: Next Steps

to Protect the Nation’s
Critical Infrastructure

WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 2007

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

I. Purpose

On  Wednesday,  September  19,  2007,  the  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology
will  hold  a  hearing  entitled  ‘‘Bridge  Safety:  Next  Steps  to  Protect  the  Nation’s  Crit-
ical  Infrastructure’’  to  examine  research  and  development  activities  to  improve  the
safety  of  the  Nation’s  bridges.  The  hearing  will  explore  the  current  state  of  bridge-
related  research,  including  government  and  academic  research  into  materials,  de-
sign  elements,  and  testing  and  inspection  technologies.  Witnesses  will  also  discuss
future research priorities for building improved bridge infrastructure and maintain-
ing current bridges to avoid catastrophic failure.
II. Witnesses
Mr.  Dennis  Judycki  is  the  Associate  Administrator  for  Research,  Development,
and Technology at the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) of the U.S. Depart-
ment  of  Transportation  (U.S.  DOT)  and  Director  of  U.S.  DOT’s  Turner-Fairbank
Highway Research Center (TFHRC).
Mr.  Benjamin  Tang  is  a  Principal  Bridge  Engineer  for  the  Office  of  Bridge  Tech-
nology at the Federal Highway Administration of the U.S. DOT.
Dr.  Kevin  Womack  is  the  Director  of  the  Utah  Transportation  Center  and  Pro-
fessor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Utah State University.
Mr.  Harry  Lee  James  is  the  Deputy  Executive  Director  and  Chief  Engineer  for
the Mississippi Department of Transportation.
Mr.  Mark  Bernhardt  is  the  Director  of  Facility  Inspection  for  Burgess  &  Niple,

III. Brief Overview

• Structural  problems,  both  major  and  minor,  plague  a  significant  portion  of
bridges  in  the  United  States.  According  to  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transpor-
tation’s National Bridge Inventory, 73,764 bridges around the U.S. (12.4 per-
cent  of  all  bridges)  were  classified  as  ‘‘structurally  deficient’’  in  2006,  includ-
ing the bridge that collapsed in Minnesota. The American Society of Civil En-
gineers  (ASCE)  in  2005  gave  the  Nation’s  bridge  infrastructure  a  ‘‘C’’  grade
in  its  Report  Card  for  America’s  Infrastructure  because  of  the  large  number
of  deficient  bridges.  However,  the  definition  of  structural  deficiency  is  broad,
and  can  cover  everything  from  non-structural  paving  issues  to  serious  flaws.
State and local inspectors are responsible for determining which bridges need
the most immediate attention.

• The challenge for policy-makers at the State, local, and federal level is to de-
termine which bridges are the highest priority for repairs given limited fund-
ing.  ASCE  estimates  that  repairing  every  deficient  bridge  across  the  Nation
would cost $9.4 billion per year for 20 years. Inspectors use a variety of meth-
ods  to  determine  if  a  bridge  has  immediate  need  of  repair,  including  visual
inspection, sensors, and other non-destructive testing technologies. The exist-
ing methods are imperfect, however, and additional research is needed to de-
velop  methods  that  will  provide  better  quality  data  on  which  bridges  are  in
greatest need of immediate repair.

• The  Federal  Highway  Administration,  State  highway  administrations,  and
universities  are  sponsoring  and  carrying  out  research  to  improve  bridge  de-
sign,  maintenance,  and  inspections.  Current  research  covers  a  variety  of
fields,  including  materials,  engineering  design,  technology  development,  and
modeling.  However,  transferring  successful  technologies  to  end-users  such  as
state highway administration officials is challenging because of cost concerns
and training issues for advanced technology.
• Additional research is needed to better understand the current and future de-
mands  on  bridges.  Traffic  loads  are  significantly  higher  than  when  many  of
the  country’s  bridges  were  built,  especially  from  truck  traffic.  FHWA  is  sup-
porting  research  to  design  the  ‘‘Bridge  of  the  Future’’  with  the  goal  of  a  cen-
tury-long  lifespan.  This  and  similar  projects  should  include  projections  for
bridge  usage  throughout  the  intended  lifespan  to  ensure  that  the  bridge
meets users’ needs.

IV. Issues and Concerns
How  are  bridges  currently  tested  for  safety,  and  how  effective  are  current
testing  methods  and  technologies?  What  technologies  and  techniques  cur-
rently  exist  to  improve  bridges’  structural  integrity?  States  are  currently  re-
sponsible  for  all  bridge  inspections,  which  must  be  carried  out  biennially  under  the
National  Bridge  Inspection  Standards  (NBIS),  which  are  enforced  by  FHWA.  If  a
bridge  is  deemed  potentially  problematic,  inspectors  can  increase  the  frequency  of
evaluations. Approximately twelve percent of bridges are inspected annually. Inspec-
tors  examine  the  bridge  deck  (primary  travel  surface),  superstructure  (which  sup-
ports the deck), and substructure (which supports the superstructure). Each compo-
nent is given a rating based on its current condition, ranging from excellent to failed
or  out  of  service.  If  the  bridge  gets  less  than  50  points  in  its  overall  rating,  it  can
be  classified  as  structurally  deficient.  For  reference,  before  it  collapsed,  the  I–35W
bridge in Minneapolis received a score of 50.

Some  technology  is  currently  in  use  to  aid  inspectors  in  their  assessments  of
bridges, but generally bridge inspectors depend on visual observations to determine
if a bridge is deficient in any category. Bridge inspectors are trained through univer-
sity  programs  and  also  must  complete  required  courses  through  FHWA’s  National
Highway  Institute  (NHI).  These  courses  are  also  used  to  deliver  information  about
new technologies emerging from the U.S. DOT.
What  future  research  is  needed  in  the  overall  field  of  bridge  safety,  and
how  can  engineers  insure  that  new  technologies  are  an  improvement  on
the current state-of-the-art? Current  bridge  research  covers  three  general  fields:
structural  engineering,  materials,  and  inspection  technologies.  Within  these  re-
search areas, many different projects are carried out or funded by universities, State
departments of transportation, and the Federal Government. Some private research,
especially  in  the  area  of  technology  design  and  development,  is  also  carried  out  by
industry. Research priorities are generally guided by end-user needs, and the trans-
portation  research  community  has  a  strong,  centralized  structure  for  sharing  both
research  results  and  technology  needs.  The  Transportation  Research  Board  (TRB),
part  of  the  National  Research  Council  (NRC),  hosts  an  annual  meeting  and  other
smaller  events  to  facilitate  collaboration  among  researchers  and  end  users  that  is
a primary source of information on research priorities. Following the bridge collapse
in Minnesota, TRB put a greater focus on the specific field of bridge safety and an-
nounced that its 2008 annual meeting would highlight the issue of aging infrastruc-
ture.  AASHTO  also  convenes  a  bridge  committee  comprised  of  State  highway  offi-
cials who are able to discuss needs specific to their states.

FHWA  is  also  working  on  their  Bridge  of  the  Future  project,  which  aims  to  use
innovative  designs  and  materials  to  build  a  bridge  that  will  have  a  lifespan  of  at
least a century (compared to current 25- to 50-year lifespans). However, the new de-
signs,  materials,  and  technologies  that  are  developed  through  these  research
projects  will  only  be  useful  if  they  are  able  to  meet  the  long-term  needs  of  users.
Many  current  bridges—81,257  in  2007—are  functionally  obsolete  because  engineers
were  unable  to  accurately  predict  the  types  of  traffic  loads  throughout  the  bridge’s
intended lifespan.
How  can  non-destructive  testing  of  existing  bridges  and  lessons  from  the
Minnesota  collapse  be  used  to  determine  which  bridges  are  the  most  sus-
ceptible  to  catastrophic  failure?  Currently,  bridge  inspectors  rely  primarily  on
visual  inspections  to  determine  whether  bridges  are  in  need  of  repair.  While  these
inspectors  go  through  rigorous  training  and  take  regular  refresher  courses  to  keep
their skills up to date, there are obvious limits to inspections which cover only sur-

face  features  of  the  bridges.  New  technologies  are  being  introduced  to  help  inspec-
tors  see  into  the  structural  elements  of  bridges  so  that  they  may  better  determine
the  overall  strength  and  integrity.  But  there  are  barriers  to  adoption  of  these  new
technologies.  Many  are  expensive  and  well  outside  the  budget  of  state  highway  ad-
ministrations.  Others  take  highly  technical  training  to  operate  effectively  and  are
too  difficult  for  busy  bridge  inspectors  to  learn  to  use.  Some  technologies  also  re-
quire  near  continuous  monitoring  or  modeling  to  identify  potential  problems.  Addi-
tional  research  is  needed  to  develop  technologies  for  non-destructive  testing  of
bridges that are effective and efficient for bridge inspectors so that catastrophic fail-
ures can be predicted before they happen.
What technology transfer programs exist at FHWA and university transpor-
tation research centers, and how effective are those programs? In  transpor-
tation  fields,  technology  transfer  is  a  special  challenge  because  no  solution  works
well  for  everyone.  Differences  in  traffic  loads,  climate,  size  and  shape,  and  other
bridge  characteristics  mean  that  new  engineering  designs,  materials,  and  tech-
nologies  may  work  well  for  a  bridge  engineer  in  California  but  not  in  New  York  or
Florida.  Thus,  technology  transfer  efforts  must  include  both  determining  the  cus-
tomer’s  unique  needs  and  transferring  the  appropriate  technology.  For  the  former,
FHWA  and  the  University  Transportation  Centers  depend  on  organizations  of  end-
users,  including  TRB  and  AASHTO,  to  facilitate  discussions  of  technology  needs.
The  strong  participation  in  these  groups  means  that  end-users  are  making  their
needs  known  to  the  appropriate  people,  but  technology  adoption  remains  slow.
FHWA programs to encourage the adoption of new technology include seminars and
discussions  at  TRB  events  and  courses  offered  at  the  National  Highway  Institute
(NHI) to train engineers and inspectors in the use of new technology.

V. Background

The  collapse  of  the  I–35W  bridge  in  Minnesota  was,  unfortunately,  not  the  first
of  its  kind.  In  1967,  a  bridge  from  West  Virginia  to  Ohio  collapsed,  killing  dozens
of  people  and  spurring  the  Federal  Highway  Administration  to  standardize  inspec-
tions  of  bridges  to  avoid  future  tragedies.  The  National  Bridge  Inspection  System
now uses a point system to help state inspectors and the Federal Government deter-
mine which bridges are in greatest need of repair. On a 100 point scale, bridges that
score less than 50 points are described as ‘‘structurally deficient.’’ Some bridges are
also  classified  as  ‘‘functionally  obsolete’’  meaning  that  they  are  unable  to  perform
to the current necessary traffic capacity. These bridges limit the size of vehicles al-
lowed  to  cross.  Neither  designation  means  that  the  bridge  is  in  imminent  danger
of  collapse.  Points  are  awarded  based  on  the  condition  of  the  substructure,  super-
structure, and surface; thus, a low scoring bridge may merely need repaving to bring
it back from structural deficiency.

The sheer number of structurally deficient bridges around the country is cause for
concern,  though,  because  many  do  have  underlying  structural  problems.  In  2006,
FHWA found that 73,764 bridges were structurally deficient, including the one that
collapsed in Minnesota. There is not a centralized system that the Federal Govern-
ment  uses  to  further  classify  structurally  deficient  bridges  as  suffering  from  dan-
gerous  structural  (as  opposed  to  cosmetic  or  less  urgent)  conditions.  This  makes  it
far  more  difficult  to  determine  the  true  vulnerability  of  the  bridges  in  the  United
States.  The  American  Society  of  Civil  Engineers  (ASCE)  has  carried  out  their  own
assessment  of  the  Nation’s  bridges,  and  found  that  the  Nation’s  urban  bridges,
which  carry  much  larger  than  average  numbers  of  vehicles  daily,  are  classified  as
structurally  deficient  at  a  much  higher  percentage  than  rural  bridges,  making  the
situation  more  dangerous  than  the  number  suggest  on  their  own.  ASCE  has  called
for  stronger  investment  in  repairing  infrastructure  and  long-term  research  efforts.
Repairs,  however,  are  an  enormous  financial  challenge.  ASCE  anticipates  a  total
cost  of  $188  billion  to  repair  all  current  structurally  deficient  bridges  around  the
country.

While the issue of bridge structural problems is not new, changing patterns in the
U.S.  transportation  sector  have  made  fixing  deficient  bridges  much  more  pressing.
The  Bureau  of  Transportation  Statistics  (BTS)  found  that  the  number  of  vehicles
on roads and bridges has increased from 156 million to 235 million since 1980, and
economic growth has spurred the long haul trucking industry to put more and heav-
ier trucks on the road. These traffic loads are far higher than those originally antici-
pated  by  bridges’  engineers,  and  may  accelerate  deterioration  of  already  crumbling
infrastructure.

Because  it  is  financially  and  logistically  unfeasible  to  repair  all  problematic
bridges around the country in the short-term, State highway administrations, bridge
inspectors,  and  the  public  rely  on  the  results  of  research  and  technology  develop-

ment to avoid catastrophic and deadly collapses. The research community has recog-
nized  bridges  as  a  priority,  and  is  putting  available  resources  into  both  short-  and
long-term  research  to  improve  safety.  However,  funding  for  this  research  is  ex-
tremely  limited.  FHWA  has  only  approximately  $22  million  available  for  bridge  re-
lated  research,  and  must  leverage  research  carried  out  by  universities,  states,  and
private industry to move forward.

Chairman  GORDON.  I  want  to  welcome  everyone  to  today’s  hear-
ing on Bridge Safety: Next Steps to Protect the Nation’s Critical In-
frastructure.  We  were  all  horrified  by  the  images  of  I–35W  bridge
collapse  in  Minneapolis  last  month,  and  the  Congress  has  begun
moving to address the serious problem of deteriorating bridges.

Infrastructure  in  the  United  States,  and  in  my  own  home  State
of  Tennessee,  37  bridges  were  found  to  be  deficient  by  Road  Im-
provement  Survey  in  2005,  and  I  am  sure  that  my  colleagues  on
the  Committee  could  all  share  similar  statistics.  Clearly  the  dis-
aster  that  struck  Minnesota  could  have  happened  anywhere.  This
is  a  wakeup  call  that  we  need  to  be  doing  more  to  strengthen  and
secure  our  bridges  now  and  for  the  long-term.  And  while  funding
bridges  is  important  and  necessary,  we  cannot  keep  on  with  busi-
ness  as  usual  if  we  are  to  maintain  a  safe,  national  inventory  of
nearly 600,000 bridges. In the American Society of Civil Engineers’
2005  Infrastructure  Report  card,  they  reported  that  it  would  cost
upwards to $188 billion just to fix the Nation’s current structurally
deficient bridges. There has to be a better, more efficient way. I am
hoping  our  witnesses  today  can  shed  some  light  on  what  that  bet-
ter way is.

The  witnesses  here  today  represent  the  Federal  Government,
State government, academia, and industry. Each of these groups is
working hard on the innovative research and development that will
hopefully help us to prevent these types of tragedies in the future.
They  are  developing  new  materials  for  stronger  decks,  new  engi-
neering  techniques  for  more  resilient  bridges,  new  technologies  to
help  inspectors  more  accurately  assess  the  conditions  of  a  bridge,
and of course, new technologies are only useful insofar as they are
adopted  by  builders  and  inspectors.  So,  I  hope  to  hear  more  about
technological transfer programs and what we can do to make inno-
vative technology more accessible to hardworking engineers and to
inspectors that need them.

Investing  our  resources  wisely  is  the  first  step  to  ensuring  the

American public crosses the Nation’s bridges confidently.

Before  I  recognize  my  friend  and  colleague,  Ranking  Member,
Mr. Hall, let me say that we are going to allow both—have two ad-
ditional  opening  statements  by  our  Chairman  and  Ranking  Mem-
ber  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Technology  Innovation  which  covers
this area, I am going to have to briefly step across the hall. I have
a bill concerning 9–1–1 that is important for all of us, and so I am
going  to  turn  to  Mr.  Wu  and  recognize  Mr.  Hall  for  his  opening
statement.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BART GORDON

I want to welcome everyone to today’s hearing on Bridge Safety: Next Steps to Pro-
tect  the  Nation’s  Critical  Infrastructure.  We  were  all  horrified  by  the  images  of  the
I–35W  bridge  collapse  in  Minneapolis  last  month,  and  Congress  has  begun  moving
to address the serious problems of deteriorating bridge infrastructure in the United
States.  In  my  home  State  of  Tennessee,  37  bridges  were  found  to  be  deficient  by
a  Road  Improvement  Survey  in  2005.  My  colleagues  on  the  Committee  could  all
share similar statistics. Clearly, the disaster that struck Minnesota could have hap-
pened anywhere. This is a wakeup call that we need to be doing more to strengthen
and secure our bridges now and for the long-term.

While  funding  repairs  is  important  and  necessary,  we  cannot  keep  on  with  busi-
ness  as  usual  if  we  are  to  maintain  a  safe  national  inventory  of  nearly  600,000

bridges.  In  the  American  Society  of  Civil  Engineers’  2005  Infrastructure  Report
Card, they reported that it would cost upwards of $188 billion just to fix our nation’s
current  structurally  deficient  bridges.  There  has  to  be  a  better,  more  efficient  way.
I’m hoping our witnesses today can shed some light on what that better way is.

The  witnesses  here  today  represent  the  Federal  Government,  State  government,
academia and industry. Each of these groups is working hard on the innovative re-
search and development that will hopefully help us prevent these types of tragedies
in  the  future.  They  are  developing  new  materials  for  stronger  decks,  new  engineer-
ing  techniques  for  more  resilient  bridges,  new  technologies  to  help  inspectors  more
accurately assess the condition of a bridge. Of course, new technologies are only use-
ful  insofar  as  they  are  adopted  by  builders  and  inspectors.  I  hope  to  hear  more
about  technology  transfer  programs,  and  what  we  can  all  do  to  make  innovative
technologies more accessible to the hardworking engineers and inspectors that need
them.

Investing our resources wisely is the first step to ensuring that the American pub-

lic crosses the Nation’s bridges confidently.

I’d now like to recognize my colleague, the Ranking Member from Texas, Mr. Hall,
for  an  opening  statement.  We’ll  then  allow  two  additional  opening  statements  from
the  Chairman  and  Ranking  Member  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Technology  and  Inno-
vation, which covers surface transportation R&D for the Committee.

Mr.  HALL.  I  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  say  good  morning
to you gentlemen. Thank you for the time you are giving us today,
the time you have given us in preparation and your trip home. We
appreciate  you  being  here  because  your  input  is  what  we  really
look  to  in  order  to  write  our  legislation  because  you  know  more
about what we are talking about than we do, and you are very kind
and gracious to give us your time.

We are a nation of infrastructure. It is kind of funny. I have had
a  lot  of  advice  from  a  lot  of  people  about  these  bridges  and  every-
thing. Every time I get up on one when I look way down there and
see little people in small cars I have some kind of an eerie feeling,
you  know,  thinking  that  some  day  that  the  thing  is  going  to  fall
if  we  don’t  do  something  about  it  and  don’t  keep  checking  it.  One
guy  suggested  to  me  that—my  district  goes  several  hundred  miles
from  Dallas  County  to  the  end  of  Texarkana,  Bowie  County,  over
to  the  Arkansas  border,  about  300  miles.  He  said,  if  you  can  stay
on them farm-to-market roads, you will be a lot safer. I don’t know
if  that  is  true  or  not,  but  maybe  you  folks  are  going  to  be  able  to
help us.

More than any other country in the world, we do rely on a mas-
sive,  interconnected  web  of  power  lines  and  power  plants,  tele-
communications  facilities,  train  tracks,  roadways,  and  bridges  to,
you  know,  go  about  our  everyday  lives;  and  that  is  why  tragedies
like  the  I–35  bridge  collapse  in  Minneapolis  strike  each  of  us  so
personally. During our own, everyday lives since August the 1st we
have  all  thought  of  the  185  people  on  the  I–35  bridge  when  it  col-
lapsed  and  the  13  who  perished.  Perhaps  as  we  drive  across
bridges  in  our  hometowns  on  the  way  to  work  or  to  the  school  or
to  the  shopping  center  down  the  road  we  think  about  it,  and  it
causes  concern.  Clearly  the  loss  of  life  is  unacceptable,  and  then
what  to  do  about  it,  what  we  can  do  about  it,  and  how  practical
it is to do what we ought to do about it and whether or not we will
do what we ought to do is something that we just have to work out
together. And we have to listen to you and try to adapt our ability
to respond to what your recommendations are.

Ensuring the safety of our basic infrastructure has to be the top
priority  of  Federal,  State,  and  local  governments.  This  is  a  core
principle of public policy and the reason the Committee is meeting

here today. Sadly, this is not the first time that a major bridge has
failed.  In  1967,  46  people  died  from  the  collapse  of  the  Silver
Bridge  in  Point  Pleasant,  West  Virginia.  The  following  year,  the
Federal  Government  began  a  nationwide  bridge  inspection  pro-
gram.  Today  the  National  Bridge  Inventory  including  almost
600,000  bridges,  almost  25  percent  of  these  are  over  50  years  old.
Of the 49,518 bridges on the inventory in my home State of Texas,
2,219  or  five  percent  are  considered  structurally  deficient.  I  live  in
the  smallest  county  in  Texas.  There  are  254  counties.  Mine  is  the
smallest  geographically.  I  have  bridges  that  I  am  very  fearful  of,
bridges  that  I  have  pictures  of  my  wife  and  me  standing,  leaning
up  against  the  banister  the  day  they  were  poured;  and  that  is  50
or  60  years  ago.  Those  bridges  are  probably  very  dangerous.  This
designation  of  structurally  deficient  doesn’t  mean  that  these
bridges are in immediate danger of collapse; it does, however, mean
that signs of fatigue and stress are beginning to show and that the
bridge  requires  close  monitoring.  The  I–35  bridge  was  one  such
structurally  deficient  bridge,  however,  and  was  inspected  a  year
prior to the collapse.

So today we have a panel before us who can tell us what we are
doing  as  a  nation  to  improve  the  monitoring  and  inspection  of
bridges. What are the technologies and the skills that will allow us
to  better  assess  and  monitor  the  health  of  these  critical  pieces  of
infrastructure?  What  can  be  done  in  the  next  five  or  10  years  to
improve  the  data  we  have  on  bridges  and  our  ability  to  correct  in-
terpret  that  data?  And  can  we  do  this  while  also  attending  to  the
other  challenges  facing  transportation  officials  such  as  growing
congestion and deteriorating roadways?

I  don’t  know.  We  would  like  to  hear  that  from  you  all.  I  wrote
a  bill  about  the  drought  that  we  have  and  how  to  address  it  later
and how to have quicker response for the ranchers and farmers be-
fore  it  is  too  late;  and  of  course,  you  know  what  the  first  question
was when I was back in my district, telling them about how I had
offered  the  drought  bill.  And  one  old  farmer  said,  well,  Congress-
man, can you make it rain? And I had just admitted that I couldn’t
and  we  would  do  something  about  that  at  a  later  time.  And  sure
enough  we  had  too  damn  much  rain  about  three  weeks  ago  and
Texoma  Lake  overran  and  drowned  out  the  rice  farmers  down
below.  Now  if  I  go  back  to  that  same  place  and  make  that  speech,
he will say, Congressman, can you make it stop raining? So we can
only  do  what  you  guys  and  ladies  and  gentlemen  point  out  to  us
and  help  us  give  your  best  judgment  on  it.  We  appreciate  your
being here.

Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Hall follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RALPH M. HALL

Good morning Mr. Chairman.
We  are  a  nation  of  infrastructure.  More  than  any  other  country  in  the  world  we
rely  on  a  massive,  interconnected  web  of  power  lines  and  power  plants,  tele-
communications  facilities,  and  train  tracks,  roadways,  and  bridges  to  go  about  our
everyday lives.

This  is  why  tragedies  like  the  I–35  bridge  collapse  in  Minneapolis  strike  each  of
us  so  personally.  During  our  own  everyday  lives  since  August  1st  we  have  all
thought of the 185 people on the I–35 bridge when it collapsed and the thirteen who

perished, perhaps as we drove across bridges in our home towns on the way to work,
or to school, or to the shopping center down the road.

Clearly this loss of life is unacceptable.
Ensuring  the  safety  of  our  basic  infrastructure  must  be  the  top  priority  of  our
Federal, State, and local governments. This is a core principle of public service and
the reason this committee is meeting today.

Sadly,  this  is  not  the  first  time  that  a  major  bridge  has  failed.  In  1967,  forty-six
people died from the collapse of the Silver Bridge in Point Pleasant, West Virginia.
The  following  year  the  Federal  Government  began  a  nationwide  bridge  inspection
program. Today, the National Bridge Inventory, includes almost 600,000 bridges. Al-
most  twenty-five  percent  of  those  are  over  fifty  years  old.  Of  the  49,518  bridges  on
the  inventory  in  my  home  State  of  Texas,  2,219  or  five  percent  are  considered
‘‘structurally deficient.’’

This  designation,  ‘‘structurally  deficient,’’  does  not  mean  these  bridges  are  in  im-
mediate danger of collapsing. It does, however, mean that signs of fatigue and stress
are  beginning  to  show  and  that  the  bridge  requires  close  monitoring.  The  I–35
bridge  was  one  such  ‘‘structurally  deficient’’  bridge,  however,  and  was  inspected  a
year prior to the collapse.

So, today, we have a panel before us who can tell us what we’re doing as a nation
to improve the monitoring and inspections of bridges. What are the technologies and
skills  that  will  allow  us  to  better  assess  and  monitor  the  health  of  these  critical
pieces  of  infrastructure?  What  can  be  done  in  the  next  five  or  ten  years  to  improve
the  data  we  have  on  bridges  and  our  ability  to  correctly  interpret  that  data?  And
can we do this while also attending to the other challenges facing transportation of-
ficials such as growing congestion and deteriorating roadways?

I look forward to hearing your answers and thank you for testifying today.
I yield back.
Mr.  WU.  [Presiding]  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Hall.  As  Chair-
man Gordon referred, on the 1st of August, the whole country was
shocked  by  the  collapse  of  the  I–35  bridge  across  Mississippi  at
Minneapolis,  and  our  condolences  and  prayers  to  all  those  who
were  directly  affected  by  that  bridge  collapse.  But  for  everybody
else  around  the  country,  I  think  that  one  thought  that  must  be  on
folks’  minds  is,  ‘‘What  about  the  bridges  that  I  drive  over?  What
about  my  commute  to  work  or  from  work?’’  These  appropriate  con-
cerns  highlight  how  much  we  have  taken  our  national  infrastruc-
ture  system  for  granted.  Of  the  116,000  or  so  bridges  in  the  Na-
tional Highway System, over 6,000 are rated structurally deficient,
80  of  these  are  in  my  home  State  of  Oregon,  and  eight  are  in  my
congressional  district.  After  the  I–35  bridge  collapse,  Congress
moved  quickly  to  offer  federal  help,  and  we  are  now  left  with  a
long-term need to better address how to constantly and consistently
evaluate  and  repair  our  national  infrastructure.  Investing  in  re-
search  to  develop  new  building  materials,  new  engineering  tech-
niques,  and  a  sufficient  technologic  toolbox  for  bridge  inspectors
will be critical to our ability to accurately assess the structural con-
dition  of  our  nation’s  bridges  and  to  develop  bridge  infrastructure
that will last for decades and perhaps even a century with minimal
repairs.

The Federal Highway Administration, State highway administra-
tions, and universities have long been engaged in surface transpor-
tation research in a wide variety of applications from bridge design
to  construction  to  inspection.  However,  the  transfer  of  these  tech-
nologies  to  end-users  has  faced  barriers  such  as  the  cost  of  tech-
nologies, engineering, and modeling.

I hope that our witnesses can address these issues.
Also, I hope that our witnesses will discuss the research and the
design  capabilities  the  Federal  Government  can  provide  for  State
inspectors  to  accurately  rank  repair  needs.  While  inspectors  use  a

11

variety of methods to determine if a bridge has an immediate need
of  repair,  the  existing  methods  are  imperfect,  and  additional  re-
search  is  needed  to  develop  methods  that  will  provide  better  qual-
ity data on which bridges require immediate attention.

I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses and their exper-
tise  to  help  guide  this  committee  in  addressing  the  research  needs
to  protect  our  aging  infrastructure  and  what  the  Federal  Govern-
ment  can  do  to  make  sure  our  citizens  do  not  question  whether  or
not their daily commute is safe.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Wu follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN DAVID WU

Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Mr.  Chairman,  on  August  1,  the  country  was  astonished  by  the  collapse  of  the
I–35 bridge in Minneapolis, and what was more certain than the thoughts and pray-
ers  on  the  American  people  to  those  affected  was  the  thought  ‘‘What  about  the
bridges I drive over? What about my commute?’’

These  are  penetrating  questions,  and  these  questions  highlight  that  we  take  our

national infrastructure system for granted.

Of the 116,172 bridges on the National Highway System, 6,175 bridges are rated
as structurally deficient. There are 80 of these bridges in my home state of Oregon
are rated as structurally deficient, and eight are in my district.

In  the  aftermath  of  the  I–35  bridge  collapse  Congress  moved  immediately  with
federal dollars. We are now left with the immediate need to evaluate and repair our
national infrastructure. The overwhelming number of bridges in need of repair, and
the associated cost requires the prioritization of federal and State resources.

Investing  in  research  to  develop  new  building  materials,  new  engineering  tech-
niques  and  a  sufficient  toolbox  for  bridge  inspectors  will  be  critical  in  our  ability
to accurately assess the structural condition of our nation’s bridges.

I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses and their expertise to help guide
this  committee  address  the  needs  of  our  aging  infrastructure  and  what  the  Federal
Government can provide to make sure our citizens do not need to question whether
or not their daily commute is safe.

Mr. WU. And now I would like to recognize the Ranking Member

of our subcommittee, Dr. Gingrey for his opening statement.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Wu,  and  Ranking  Member
Hall.  I  have  some  prepared  remarks.  I  can’t  resist  the  urge  like
most Members to ad lib a little bit here.

I  will  start  out  by  saying  I  am  certainly  proud  to  be  here  with
the  Rainmaker.  I  didn’t  realize  that  movie  was  based  on  the  legis-
lative  life  of  Ralph  Hall.  That  was  a  very  interesting  little  bit  of
information.

Again,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  do  thank  you,  and  I  would  like  to  start
by reiterating as we all have the deep felt sorrow and concern that
we  all  have  for  the  family  members  and  the  loved  ones  of  those
who  died  in  the  collapse  of  the  Interstate  35  West  bridge  in  Min-
neapolis.  I  believe  it  was  on  August  1st  of  this  year.  Our  thoughts
and  prayers  continue  to  go  out  to  the  families  of  those  who  lost
their lives.

Bridge  safety  is  a  growing  problem  across  the  country  and  in-
cludes  not  just  the  National  Highway  System  but  of  course  the
many  more  bridges  and  the  state  and  local  roadways.  In  my  State
of  Georgia,  as  an  example,  there  are  14,500  bridge,  14,500  just  in
the State of Georgia, population about 9.4 million people. One thou-
sand  one  hundred  of  these  bridges,  that  is  about  eight  percent  of
the  total,  are  ‘‘structurally  deficient;’’  and  nationally,  12  percent  of
bridges  have  received  that  rating  and  in  some  states  it  goes  up  as
high as 25 percent structurally deficient.

12

Structurally  deficient  bridges  can  be  found  in  every  part  of  the
country  in  the  midst  of  sprawling  cities  but  also  out  in  the  remote
areas  as  Ranking  Member  Hall  indicated  and  stated  in  his  re-
marks. Repairing them will take an enormous effort that will need
the  aid  of  science  and  technology;  and  hopefully  we  can  build  ad-
vanced structures that are more robust, that are more reliable, and
that will have the ability to detect potential problems and warn of-
ficials electronically.

On the ad lib part, let me just say that 42 years ago, I was work-
ing  as  a  co-op  student.  I  was  attending  Georgia  Tech  as  a  chem-
istry  major,  and  I  was  working  at  a  nuclear  plant  in  South  Caro-
lina.  And  my  job,  one  quarter,  was  to  run  a  probe  through  a  heat
exchanger,  and  I  think  there  were  25  different  channels  in  that
heat exchanger. And you could literally take these heat exchangers
off  of  the  reactor  and  inspect  with  this  probe  any  deterioration  or
corrosion of the metal, and that was 42 years ago I was doing that.
You think about today and walk in any bathroom almost anywhere,
in any city, in any country, and electronically the commode flushes
and  the  water  turns  on  and  off.  So  you  know,  I  think  it  probably
is  the  time,  as  I  continue  with  my  prepared  remarks,  that  we  will
be  able  to  do  that  in  regard  to  the  safety  of  these  bridges  and  not
have to rely just on physical inspection on a periodic basis. I know
reaching  the  goal  will  not  be  easy.  Replacing  aging  bridges  with
new  technology,  advanced  designs,  is  going  to  require  time  and
money  that  the  federal  and  the  State  transportation  departments,
they  don’t  have  it.  They  don’t  have  it  readily  at  hand  today.  We
have  a  strong  need  for  research  and  development  of  low-cost  ap-
proaches to inspect or rehabilitate bridges.

I  am  particularly  concerned  about  our  current  visual  inspection
techniques  and  what  can  be  done  to  improve  this  system  in  the
near  future.  In  the  near  future.  I  would  like  to  draw  the  panel’s
attention  to  this  issue.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  your  thoughts.
Technology  such  as  embedded  sensors  clearly  offers  dramatically
more  precise  and  accurate  data.  However,  we  are  a  long  way  from
a widespread use of such systems and will continue to rely on prop-
erly  trained  personnel  to  make  those  final  safety  determinations,
even  though  as  Chairman  Wu  indicated  or  someone  at  the  dais,  a
year ago, a year before this tragic accident as I understand it, there
was  this  physical  inspection.  And  maybe  the  panelists  will  be  able
to tell us about the recent construction on that bridge to maybe de-
termine if that had any effect, either.

But  we  need  to  have  inspection  processes  and  training  that  are
validated as effective and regularly improved. I am pleased that we
will hear today from Mark Bernhardt, a bridge inspector. His com-
pany  has  contracts  in  over  10  states,  and  he  can  give  us  a  sense
of what a well-trained individual can do, but for that matter, what
a well-, best-trained individual just physically can’t do.

So  I  thank  the  panel  for  coming  before  us  today,  and  I  look  for-
ward to an enlightening discussion on research and development in
this area.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE PHIL GINGREY

Thank you Mr. Chairman. I’d like to start by reiterating the deep-felt sorrow and
concern  that  we  all  have  for  the  family  members  and  loved-ones  of  those  who  died
in  the  collapse  of  the  Interstate  35  West  Bridge  in  Minneapolis  on  August  1st  of
this year. Our thoughts and prayers are with them.

Bridge  safety  is  a  growing  problem  across  the  country  and  includes  not  just  the
National  Highway  System,  but  State  and  local  roadways  as  well.  In  my  State  of
Georgia, for example, there are 14,523 bridges. 1,113 of these bridges, or about eight
percent, are ‘‘structurally deficient.’’ Nationally, 12 percent of bridges have received
this  rating  and  some  states  have  as  high  as  25  percent  of  their  bridges  listed  as
‘‘structurally deficient.’’

Structurally  deficient  bridges  can  be  found  in  every  part  of  the  country,  in  the
middle  of  sprawling  cities  and  in  remote  wildlands.  Repairing  them  will  take  an
enormous effort that will need the aid of science and technology. Hopefully, we can
build  advanced  structures  that  are  more  robust,  more  reliable  and  that  will  have
the  ability  to  detect  potential  problems  and  warn  officials  electronically.  Reaching
this  goal  will  not  be  easy,  however.  Replacing  aging  bridges  with  new,  techno-
logically  enhanced  designs  will  require  time  and  money  that  federal  and  State
transportation  departments  DO  NOT  have  readily  at  hand.  We  have  a  STRONG
need for research and development of low-cost approaches to inspect or rehabilitate
bridges.

I  am  particularly  CONCERNED  about  our  current  visual  inspection  techniques
and  what  can  be  done  to  improve  this  system  in  the  near  future.  I’d  like  draw  the
panel’s  attention  to  this  issue  and  look  forward  to  hearing  your  thoughts.  Tech-
nology  such  as  embedded  sensors  clearly  offers  dramatically  more  PRECISE  and
ACCURATE data. However, we are a long way from widespread use of such systems
and  will  continue  to  rely  on  properly  trained  personnel  to  make  final  safety  deter-
minations. We need to have inspection processes and training that are validated as
effective and regularly improved. I’m pleased that we’ll hear today from Mark Bern-
hardt,  a  bridge  inspector  whose  company  has  contracts  in  over  10  states  and  who
can  give  us  a  sense  of  what  a  well-trained  individual  can  do  and  for  that  matter,
what a trained individual cannot do.

I  thank  the  entire  panel  for  coming  before  us  today,  and  look  forward  to  an  en-
lightening  discussion  on  Research  &  Development  in  this  area.  Thank  you  and  I
yield back.

Mr. WU. Thank you, Dr. Gingrey. If there are Members who wish
to  submit  additional  opening  statements,  your  statement  will  be

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to be here today as we examine research
and  development  measures  to  address  structurally  deficient  bridges  in  the  United
States. I would like to welcome today’s witnesses.

The  tragic  bridge  collapse  that  occurred  on  August  1,  2007,  in  Minneapolis,  MN,
serves as a wake up call that we must properly invest in maintaining our infrastruc-
ture, which includes the tools needed to evaluate and monitor its condition.

While we have a first-class transportation system, it is in many instances nearing
the end of its life expectancy, and we have neglected to upgrade and modernize our
infrastructure over the years.

For  example,  our  Interstate  Highway  System  is  almost  50  years  old.  Thirty-two
percent  of  our  major  roads  are  in  poor  or  mediocre  condition;  one  of  every  eight
bridges  is  structurally  deficient;  and  36  percent  of  the  Nation’s  urban  rail  vehicles
and maintenance facilities are in substandard or poor condition.

While the need for construction upgrades and renovations are apparent, we must
also  recognize  the  vital  need  for  technological  advancements  in  tools  and  methods
to safely, accurately, and economically evaluate these structures.

We should not build our infrastructure and then walk away without maintaining,
evaluating,  and  modernizing  it  as  it  becomes  unsafe.  I  supported  a  $375  billion
highway bill that was advocated by a 2002 Department of Transportation report be-
cause I strongly believe that our infrastructure must be a top priority. We were able
to pass a $286.4 billion bill; however, that is not enough to meet our needs. Accord-
ing  to  DOT,  more  than  $65  billion  could  be  invested  immediately  by  all  levels  of
government, to replace or otherwise address existing bridge deficiencies.

While  we  have  programs  and  money  specifically  established  in  the  highway  bill
for  bridge  improvements  and  repairs,  money  is  allowed  to  be  transferred  and  re-
scinded  to  other  accounts.  That  inhibits  completion  of  important  projects,  including
making sure our bridges are structurally sound.

We  must  find  a  way  to  make  the  necessary  improvements  to  our  roads  and
bridges  to  make  sure  the  highest  level  of  safety  is  maintained  and  that  the  U.S.
economy remains strong. As we have not kept up with the maintenance and upkeep
of  our  bridges,  it  is  even  more  vital  to  develop  advanced  technologies  to  evaluate
and monitor current bridge structures. I am interested in hearing the thoughts and
ideas of our witnesses on these topics.

I look forward to today’s hearing as we examine these important issues.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Carnahan follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSS CARNAHAN

Mr. Chairman, thank you for hosting this hearing to examine research and devel-
opment activities to improve bridge safety through enhanced structural engineering
and inspection technologies.

As  increasing  traffic  loads  take  their  toll  on  America’s  transportation  infrastruc-
ture, the Nation’s bridges are plagued by growing structural deficiencies that range
from  paving  issues  to  serious,  life-threatening  flaws.  Numerous  analysts  over  the
past  few  years  have  concluded  that  more  than  twelve  percent  of  the  country’s
bridges  will  require  urgent  repairs  over  the  next  several  years,  at  a  cost  of  nearly
$200 billion. The challenge facing policy-makers and inspectors is to determine how
to allocate limited funding to the bridges in greatest need of repair.

The  tragic  collapse  of  Interstate  35W  in  Minnesota  brought  our  attention  to  a
widespread  problem  that  affects  every  community.  In  my  home  State  of  Missouri,
nearly 8,000 bridges have been identified as structurally deficient or functionally ob-
solete, including 125 Interstate Highway bridges. The total average daily traffic over
structurally deficient interstate bridges in Missouri is 3,280,648 vehicles.

Moreover,  the  Federal  Highway  Administration  has  listed  eight  bridges  on  the
National  Highway  System  in  my  district  (MO–3)  to  be  structurally  deficient.  These
bridges  include:  I–55  North  at  Hillsboro  Road  in  Jefferson  County,  I–64  East  at
Laclede Station Road in St. Louis County, I–64 East at Clayton Terrace in St. Louis
County, I–64 East at McCausland Ave in St. Louis City, I–44 West at Kingshighway
Blvd.  in  St.  Louis  City,  I–55  North  at  2nd  Street  in  St.  Louis  City,  I–64  West  at
I–55 in St. Louis City and I–64 East at I–55 in St. Louis City.

Improving  bridge  safety  is  imperative.  While  I  believe  we  must  direct  more  re-
sources  towards  our  nation’s  infrastructure,  it  is  also  crucial  that  we  direct  our  at-
tention  to  the  subject  of  today’s  hearing,  improving  technology  for  bridge  design,
maintenance,  and  inspection,  and  reviewing  current  methods  of  collaboration  and
technology transfer between the research community and State highway administra-
tions.  I  am  eager  to  hear  our  witnesses’  assessments  of  bridge-related  innovation
and research priorities. Your first-hand experiences are vital to maintaining our na-
tion’s infrastructure.

To all the witnesses—thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules to ap-

pear before us today. I look forward to hearing your testimony.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE CHARLIE MELANCON

Thank  you  Chairman  Gordon  and  Ranking  Member  Hall  for  holding  this  impor-
tant  hearing  on  bridge  safety.  Since  the  collapse  of  the  I–35  bridge  in  Minnesota,
many Americans have questioned the safety of the bridges they cross every day, but
this  is  only  one  part  of  a  much  larger  issue.  The  tragedy  in  Minnesota  emphasizes
the  importance  of  not  just  bridge  safety,  but  the  safety  of  our  entire  public  infra-
structure system.

Americans depend on public infrastructure every day and they deserve to be con-
fidant  that  their  tax  dollars  are  being  used  to  make  them  safe  during  their  com-
mutes  and  in  their  communities.  As  their  elected  representatives  in  government,  it
is our job to promote this security by ensuring that all elements of public infrastruc-
ture—bridges, roads, dams, and levees—are up to code.

These are needs—not wants. The United States cannot prosper and grow without
safe, reliable public infrastructure. We only have to look to our recent past for proof.
As we saw after Hurricane Katrina, the manmade disaster caused by the levee fail-
ures was more disastrous to New Orleans and south Louisiana than the damage in-

flicted by the hurricane. It was the levee failures that made Katrina the most costly,
and one of the most deadly, disasters in U.S. history.

I  applaud  this  committee  for  its  work  to  ensure  that  our  bridges  are  safe.  How-
ever, I hope that the work does not end there. Let us take this opportunity to begin
studying the safety of all the elements of our public infrastructure system—bridges,
roads, dams and, not least of all, levees. We owe it to the American public to make
sure they have reason to feel safe again.
Thank you and I yield back my time.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Mitchell follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE HARRY E. MITCHELL

Mr. Chairman,

Thank you for convening this morning’s hearing.
All of us extend our deepest sympathies to the Minneapolis community and to the

loved ones who died or were injured in the I–35 West Bridge collapse.

This  is  the  second  hearing  in  which  I  have  participated  investigating  this  tragic
accident.  The  Transportation  and  Infrastructure  Committee,  on  which  I  also  serve,
held a hearing on the causes of the accident two weeks ago.

I am pleased that Chairman Gordon has called us here today to look at the issue
from  a  different  perspective. . .that  of  the  current  state  of  bridge  safety-related  re-
search.

Of  the  600,000  bridges  in  the  U.S.,  73,764,  or  more  than  12  percent,  of  them  are
considered  to  be  deficient.  One  of  those  bridges  included  the  I–35  West  Bridge  in
Minneapolis.  The  American  Society  of  Civil  Engineers  rates  the  Nation’s  bridge  in-
frastructure by the letter grade of ‘‘C.’’ I am glad to report that ASCE gave Arizona
an ‘‘Aminus’’ for highway bridge safety.

Arizona  is  a  growing  state  and  a  good  deal  of  our  infrastructure  is  new.  It  is  an
arid  state,  and  as  a  result,  our  bridges  are  subject  to  fewer  corrosive  factors  such
as moisture.

Of  the  7,248  bridges  in  Arizona,  161  are  considered  deficient.  Arizona  residents
want assurances that the bridges they travel across are safe and sturdy structures.
Last month, I accompanied representatives of Arizona’s State Department of Trans-
portation.  We  toured  the  Loop  202  bridge  over  56th  Street,  and  they  walked  me
through the inspection process. I came away from that tour with a better apprecia-
tion of the inspection process. The inspection protocols are both time consuming and
expensive.

We  need  to  explore  ways  and  techniques  by  which  we  can  detect  structural  defi-
ciencies earlier, more accurately and within reasonable costs. For the most part, the
inspection  process  provides  engineers  with  only  a  ‘‘snapshot’’  of  bridge  conditions.
We  look  to  research  projects  and  technological  developments  that  will  enable  us  to
assess bridge conditions over a longer span of the infrastructure’s life cycle.

Today’s  hearing  will  provide  us  with  some  ideas  on  the  appropriate  methods  to
conduct relevant research and development into infrastructure research and innova-
tion.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr.  WU.  I  am  deeply  pleased  to  have  such  an  expert  group  of
witnesses  before  the  Committee  today  to  discuss  this  very  impor-
tant  topic.  Mr.  Dennis  Judycki  is  the  Associate  Administrator  for
Research,  Development,  and  Technology  at  the  Federal  Highway
Administration  and  Director  of  the  U.S.  DOT’s  Turner-Fairbank
Highway  Research  Center.  With  him  is  Mr.  Benjamin  Tang,  Prin-
cipal  Bridge  Engineer  for  the  Office  of  Bridge  Technology  at  the
FHA.  Mr.  Harry  Lee  James  is  the  Deputy  Executive  Director  and
Chief  Engineer  for  the  Mississippi  Department  of  Transportation.
Dr. Kevin Womack is a Director of the Utah Transportation Center
and  Professor  of  Civil  and  Environmental  Engineering  at  Utah
State  University.  Finally,  we  have  Mr.  Mark  Bernhardt,  Director
of  Facility  Inspection  for  Burgess  &  Niple,  an  engineering  firm  in
Ohio. Thank you all for being here.

As our witnesses already know, spoken testimony is to be limited
to  five  minutes  each.  Your  written  statements  will  be  entered  into

STATEMENT OF MR. DENNIS C. JUDYCKI, ASSOCIATE ADMINIS-
TRATOR,  RESEARCH,  DEVELOPMENT,  AND  TECHNOLOGY,
FEDERAL  HIGHWAY  ADMINISTRATION,  U.S.  DEPARTMENT
OF  TRANSPORTATION;  ACCOMPANIED  BY  MR.  BENJAMIN
TANG,  PRINCIPAL  BRIDGE  ENGINEER/TEAM  LEADER,  OF-
FICE OF BRIDGE TECHNOLOGY, FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMIN-
ISTRATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
Mr. JUDYCKI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members, it is a pleas-
ure  to  be  here.  I  am  pleased  to  report  today  on  Federal  Highway’s
research,  development,  and  technology  activities  that  enhance  our
highway bridges. And as you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, joining me
today  is  Benjamin  Tang,  the  Principal  Bridge  Engineer  with  the
Federal Highway Administration.

As  you  have  mentioned,  America  was  stunned  by  the  collapse  of
the I–35 bridge in Minneapolis. The cause of the failure is still un-
known,  and  Federal  Highways  is  assisting  the  National  Transpor-
tation Safety Board in their investigation of the collapse.

Several  Turner-Fairbank  Highway  Research  Center  experts  are,
as we speak, on site helping with the forensic work. Others are de-
veloping  a  computer  model  to  evaluate  the  behavior  of  the  bridge.
Although examination of the physical members of the bridge being
recovered  from  the  site  provides  the  best  evidence  of  why  the
bridge collapsed, the computer allows simulation and evaluation of
multiple  failure  scenarios,  which  can  be  evaluated  against  the  ac-
tual bridge failure and physical forensic evidence.

We  are  committed  to  helping  the  NTSB  complete  its  work  as
quickly as possible, but certainly, as you can appreciate, must take
the time to fully understand what happened so that we can be sure
that this tragedy will not happen again.

Federal, State, and local transportation agencies consider the in-
spection of the Nation’s nearly 600,000 bridges to be of vital impor-
tance and invest significant funds in bridge inspection technologies
and  techniques  for  which  have  been  evolving  for  the  last  30  years
since  the  establishment  of  the  National  Bridge  Inspection  Stand-
ards.  Commonly  used  methods  for  evaluating  concrete  members
during  ‘‘routine’’  inspections  include  mechanical  sounding  to  iden-
tify  areas  of  delamination  and  degradation.  Similarly  for  steel
members,  routine  methods  include  cleaning  and  scraping,  and  the
use of various tests to identify cracking and areas of significant cor-
rosion.  More  state-of-the  art  methods  utilized  during  in-depth  in-
spections  for  concrete  and  steel  bridges  include  impact  echo,  infra-
red thermology, ground-penetrating radar, and ultrasonic methods.
There  are  numerous  other  technologies  under  development  that
have  the  potential  to  substantially  advance  the  practice  of  bridge
inspection.  Unfortunately,  there  is  no  one-size-fits-all  approach  for
use  of  non-destructive  evaluation  testing.  Each  technology  is  de-
signed  for  a  specific  purpose  and  for  a  specific  function.  Federal
highways,  state  DOTs,  university  transportation  centers,  and  in-
dustries continue to investigate and improve the practicality in ad-
vancing these technologies.

There are also a number of monitoring systems that can be used
to provide real-time data and alert bridge owners to such things as
threshold  stresses  in  load-carrying  members,  excessive  movement,
crack  growth,  or  scour  around  a  bridge  pier.  However,  monitoring
systems don’t eliminate the need for regular visual inspections, nor
do  they  ensure  that  failure  of  a  bridge  component  will  not  occur.
Federal Highways is actively coordinating a National Bridge Re-
search  Program  with  our  partners  and  stakeholders,  and  our  re-
search  and  development  efforts  include  not  only  promising  ad-
vanced  non-destructive  evaluation  technologies  for  inspection,  but
also long-term bridge performance and high performance structures
and innovative materials.

The  current  Federal  Highway  Bridge  Research  Program  is  fo-
cused  on  effective  stewardship  and  management  of  bridge  infra-
structure,  assuring  of  a  high  level  of  safety  and  security  for  high-
way bridges, and thirdly, developing the ‘‘Bridge of the Future.’’

FHWA’s  responsibility  for  research  and  technology  encompasses
not only managing and conducting research and sharing the result
but certainly supporting and facilitating technology and innovation
deployment.  This  includes  working  with  University  Transportation
Centers,  others  in  academia,  the  State  DOTs,  industry,  and  the
Transportation Research Board.

FHWA  also  utilizes  its  Local  Technical  Assistance  Program  as  a
mechanism  for  transferring  technologies  to  State  and  local  agen-
cies,  and  education  and  training  programs  provided  through  our
National  Highway  Institute  help  introduce  new  technologies  and
raise  the  state  of  the  practice.  Ultimately,  though,  a  key  measure
of  success  for  any  highway  technology  innovation  depends  on  the
acceptance and adoption by stakeholders.

It  is  Federal  Highway’s  ongoing  responsibility  to  continue  to  ad-
vance the state-of-the-art through research and development and to
work  with  our  partners  to  raise  the  state-of-the-practice  in  bridge
engineering.

I would like to thank you again for the opportunity to testify and

will be pleased to answer any questions that you may have.

[The  prepared  statement  of  Mr.  Judycki  and  Mr.  Tang  follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DENNIS JUDYCKI AND BENJAMIN TANG

Mr. Chairman and Members, we are pleased to appear before you today to report
on  the  Department  of  Transportation’s  research,  development,  testing,  and  evalua-
tion activities, as administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), to
ensure the safety of the Nation’s highway bridges. This is a very important hearing
topic  in  the  wake  of  the  tragic  collapse  of  the  Interstate  35  West  (I–35W)  bridge
over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota. On behalf of the Department,
we extend our deepest sympathy to the loved ones of those who died and to the in-
jured.
Minnesota Bridge Collapse

America  was  stunned  by  the  collapse  of  the  I–35W  bridge  at  approximately  6:00
PM,  Central  Daylight  Time,  on  Wednesday,  August  1,  2007.  Numerous  vehicles
were on the bridge at the time and there were 13 fatalities and 123 people injured.
The  I–35W  bridge  originally  opened  in  November  1967  and  became  one  of  the  crit-
ical  facilities  in  a  vital  commercial  and  commuting  corridor.  The  bridge  was  an
eight-lane,  steel  deck  truss  structure  that  rose  64  feet  above  the  Mississippi  River.
The  main  span  extended  to  456  feet  in  length  to  avoid  putting  piers  in  the  water
which  would  have  impeded  river  navigation.  As  of  the  2004  count,  an  estimated
141,000 vehicles traveled per day on the bridge.

18

We do not yet know why the I–35W bridge failed, and the Department is working
closely  with  the  National  Transportation  Safety  Board  (NTSB)  as  it  continues  its
investigation  to  determine  the  cause  or  causes.  In  the  interim,  we  are  taking  every
step  to  reassure  the  public  that  America’s  infrastructure  is  safe.  The  Secretary  of
Transportation  has  issued  two  advisories  to  States  in  response  to  what  has  been
learned so far, asking that States re-inspect their steel deck truss bridges and that
they  be  mindful  of  the  added  weight  construction  projects  may  bring  to  bear  on
bridges.

The  Federal  Highway  Administration  is  assisting  the  NTSB  in  a  thorough  inves-
tigation,  which  includes  a  structural  analysis  of  the  bridge.  Within  days  of  the  col-
lapse,  development  of  a  computer  model  based  upon  the  original  design  drawings
for  the  bridge  began  at  FHWA’s  Turner-Fairbank  Highway  Research  Center  in
McLean,  Virginia.  This  model  can  perform  simulations  to  determine  the  effect  on
the bridge of removing or weakening certain elements to recreate, virtually, the ac-
tual condition of the bridge just prior to and during the bridge’s collapse.

By finding elements that, if weakened or removed, result in a bridge failure simi-
lar  to  the  actual  bridge  failure,  the  investigators’  work  is  considerably  shortened.
While  examination  of  the  physical  members  of  the  bridge  being  recovered  from  the
site provides the best evidence of why the bridge collapsed, the analytical model al-
lows  the  evaluation  of  multiple  scenarios  which  can  then  be  validated  against  the
physical forensic evidence. We are committed to accomplishing this work as quickly
as  possible,  but  it  is  expected  to  take  several  months.  Our  experts  will  continue  to
be  there,  on  the  ground  in  Minneapolis,  to  provide  assistance.  We  need  to  fully  un-
derstand  what  happened  so  we  can  take  every  possible  step  to  ensure  that  such  a
tragedy  does  not  happen  again.  Data  collected  at  the  accident  scene,  with  the  help
of  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation’s  3–D  laser  scanning  technology,  is  being
used to assist in the investigation.

Federal,  State,  and  local  transportation  agencies  consider  the  inspection  of  our
nearly  600,000  bridges  to  be  of  vital  importance  and  invest  significant  funds  in
bridge  inspection  activities  each  year.  We  strive  to  ensure  that  the  quality  of  our
bridge inspection program is maintained at the highest level and that our funds are
utilized as effectively as possible. On August 2, the day after the collapse, Secretary
of Transportation Mary E. Peters requested the Department of Transportation’s In-
spector  General  to  conduct  a  rigorous  assessment  of  the  federal-aid  bridge  program
and the National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS).
National Bridge Inspection Program

The  National  Bridge  Inspection  Program  was  created  in  response  to  the  collapse,
in  1967,  of  the  Silver  Bridge  over  the  Ohio  River  between  West  Virginia  and  Ohio,
which  killed  46  people.  At  the  time  of  that  collapse,  the  exact  number  of  highway
bridges  in  the  United  States  was  unknown,  and  there  was  no  systematic  bridge  in-
spection  program  to  monitor  the  condition  of  existing  bridges.  In  the  Federal-aid
Highway Act of 1968, Congress directed the Secretary of Transportation in coopera-
tion with State highway officials to establish: (1) NBIS for the proper safety inspec-
tion  of  bridges,  and  (2)  a  program  to  train  employees  involved  in  bridge  inspection
to carry out the program. As a result, the NBIS regulation was developed, a bridge
inspector’s  training  manual  was  prepared,  and  a  comprehensive  training  course,
based  on  the  manual,  was  developed  to  provide  specialized  training.  To  address
varying needs and circumstances, State and local standards are often even more re-
strictive than the national standards.

The  NBIS  require  safety  inspections  at  least  once  every  24  months  for  highway
bridges that exceed 20 feet in total length located on public roads. Many bridges are
inspected  more  frequently.  However,  with  the  express  approval  by  FHWA  of  State-
specific policies and criteria, some bridges can be inspected at intervals greater than
24  months.  New  or  newly  reconstructed  bridges,  for  example,  may  qualify  for  less
frequent  inspections.  Approximately  83  percent  of  bridges  are  inspected  once  every
24  months,  12  percent  are  inspected  annually,  and  five  percent  are  inspected  on  a
48-month cycle.

The State transportation department (State DOT) must inspect, or cause to be in-
spected, all highway bridges on public roads that are fully or partially located with-
in  the  State’s  boundaries,  except  for  bridges  owned  by  federal  agencies.  States  may
use  their  Highway  Bridge  Program  funds  for  bridge  inspection  activities.  Privately
owned bridges, including commercial railroad bridges and some international cross-
ings, are not legally mandated to adhere to the NBIS requirements; however, many
privately owned bridges on public roads are being inspected in accordance with the
NBIS.

For bridges subject to NBIS requirements, information is collected on bridge com-
position and conditions and reported to FHWA, where the data is maintained in the

National  Bridge  Inventory  (NBI)  database.  The  NBI  is  essentially  a  database  of
bridge information that is ‘‘frozen’’ at a given point in time. This information forms
the basis of, and provides the mechanism for, the determination of the formula fac-
tor  used  to  apportion  Highway  Bridge  Program  funds  to  the  states.  A  sufficiency
rating (SR) is calculated based on the NBI data items on structural condition, func-
tional  obsolescence,  and  essentiality  for  public  use.  The  SR  is  then  used  program-
matically  to  determine  eligibility  for  rehabilitation  or  replacement  using  Highway
Bridge Program funds.

Bridge  inspection  techniques  and  technologies  have  been  continuously  evolving
since  the  NBIS  were  established  over  30  years  ago  and  the  NBIS  regulation  has
been updated several times as Congress has revised the inspection program and its
companion  program,  the  Highway  Bridge  Program  (formerly  Highway  Bridge  Re-
placement  and  Rehabilitation  Program).  The  most  recent  NBIS  revision  took  effect
in January 2005. The bridge inspector’s reference manual has been updated as well,
and  we  have  developed,  through  our  National  Highway  Institute  (NHI),  an  array
of bridge inspection training courses.

There  are  five  basic  types  of  bridge  inspections—initial,  routine,  in-depth,  dam-
age, and special. The first inspection to be completed on a bridge is the ‘‘initial’’ in-
spection. The purpose of this inspection is to provide all the structure inventory and
appraisal  data,  to  establish  baseline  structural  conditions,  and  to  identify  and  list
any  existing  problems  or  any  locations  in  the  structure  that  may  have  potential
problems. The ‘‘routine’’ inspection is the most common type of inspection performed
and  is  generally  required  every  two  years.  The  purpose  of  ‘‘routine’’  inspections  is
to determine the physical and functional condition of a bridge on a regularly sched-
uled basis. An ‘‘in-depth’’ inspection is a close-up, hands-on inspection of one or more
members above or below the water level to identify potential deficiencies not readily
detectable  using  routine  inspection  procedures.  A  ‘‘damage’’  inspection  is  an  emer-
gency  inspection  conducted  to  assess  structural  damage  immediately  following  an
accident  or  resulting  from  unanticipated  environmental  factors  or  human  actions.
Finally,  a  ‘‘special’’  inspection  is  used  to  monitor,  on  a  regular  basis,  a  known  or
suspected deficiency.

Safety  is  enhanced  through  these  inspections  and  by  ‘‘rating’’  bridge  components,
such  as  the  deck,  superstructure,  and  substructure,  and  by  the  use  of  non-destruc-
tive  evaluation  (NDE)  methods  and  other  advanced  technologies.  Visual  inspection
is  the  primary  method  used  to  perform  routine  bridge  inspections,  and  tools  for
cleaning,  probing,  sounding,  and  measuring,  and  visual  aids  are  typically  used.  On
occasion,  destructive  tests  are  conducted  to  evaluate  specific  areas  or  materials  of
concern,  or  to  help  identify  appropriate  rehabilitative  work.  Type,  location,  accessi-
bility, and condition of a bridge, as well as type of inspection, are some of the factors
that  determine  what  methods  of  inspection  practices  are  used.  When  problems  are
detected, or during the inspection of critical areas, more advanced methods are em-
ployed.

Commonly used methods for evaluating concrete elements during ‘‘routine’’ inspec-
tions include mechanical sounding to identify areas of delamination (the separation
of  a  layer  of  concrete  from  the  reinforcing  steel  in  the  concrete  member)  and  other
forms  of  concrete  degradation.  Similarly,  for  the  ‘‘routine’’  inspection  of  steel  mem-
bers, methods include cleaning and scraping, and the use of dye penetrant and mag-
netic particle testing to identify cracking and areas of significant corrosion.

State-of-the-art  methods  utilized  during  ‘‘in-depth,’’  ‘‘damage,’’  and  ‘‘special’’  in-
spections  include  impact  echo,  infrared  thermography,  ground  penetrating  radar,
and  strain  gauges  for  concrete  structures  and  elements,  and  ultrasonic,  eddy  cur-
rent,  radiography,  acoustic  emissions,  strain  gauges,  and  x-ray  technology  for  steel
structures and elements.

There are numerous other technologies under development that have the potential
to  substantially  advance  the  practices  used  for  bridge  inspection.  Some  of  these
technologies are also being developed or are in limited use by other industries, such
as the aerospace and nuclear industries. There is no one-size-fits-all approach in the
use  of  non-destructive  evaluations  and  testing;  each  technology  is  designed  for  a
specific  purpose  and  function.  Although  these  developing  technologies  have  the  po-
tential  to  augment  and  advance  bridge  inspection  practice,  the  challenge  is  to  find
a way to make them efficient, effective, and practical for field use. FHWA, industry,
academia,  the  Transportation  Research  Board  (TRB),  and  State  DOTs  continue  to
investigate  and  improve  the  practicality  of  many  of  these  technologies.  As  a  result
of these efforts, a number of systems have recently become available that can assist
an inspector in the identification and quantification of such things as reinforced con-
crete deterioration, steel tendon distress, and the displacement or rotation of critical
members in a bridge.

There  are  also  a  number  of  monitoring  systems  that  can  be  used  to  provide  real
time data and alert the bridge owner to such things as failure of load carrying mem-
bers,  excessive  rotation  or  displacement  of  an  element,  overload  in  a  member,
growth  of  a  crack,  or  scour  around  a  bridge  pier.  The  type  of  information  provided
by these systems is either very specific and provides detailed information on isolated
areas  or  members  of  the  bridge,  or  rather  generic  and  provides  general  bridge  be-
havior  information.  The  most  practical  of  these  systems  are  being  used  by  owners
following  an  ‘‘in-depth’’  or  ‘‘special’’  inspection,  to  monitor  the  performance  of  the
element  or  the  bridge,  when  some  specific  concern  has  been  raised  but  the  concern
is  not  considered  to  be  a  short-term  safety  hazard.  However,  the  effectiveness  and
costs  associated  with  monitoring  systems  must  be  weighed  against  the  benefits
gained.  Like  any  emerging  technology,  changes  and  updates  in  monitoring  systems
can  become  a  big  challenge  to  maintain  economically  over  the  long  haul.  Today,
bridges  are  being  built  to  last  75  to  100  years  and  installing  any  new  monitoring
systems  and  expecting  them  to  be  durable  and  serviceable  for  such  a  long  period
has  never  been  done  before.  Monitoring  systems  that  are  available  today  require
routine maintenance and repair, and continuous assessment to ensure that they are
working correctly. In addition, they do not eliminate the need for regular visual in-
spections. In many circumstances, it is more effective to increase the inspection fre-
quency, repair or retrofit areas of concern, or replace the structure.

Since  1994,  the  percentage  of  the  Nation’s  bridges  that  are  classified  as  ‘‘struc-
turally  deficient’’  has  declined  from  18.7  percent  to  12.1  percent.  The  term  ‘‘struc-
turally  deficient’’  is  a  technical  engineering  term  used  to  classify  bridges  according
to  serviceability,  safety,  and  essentiality  for  public  use.  Bridges  are  considered
‘‘structurally  deficient’’  if  significant  load-carrying  elements  are  found  to  be  in  poor
or worse condition due to deterioration or damage, or the adequacy of the waterway
opening  provided  by  the  bridge  is  determined  to  be  extremely  insufficient  to  the
point of causing intolerable traffic interruptions. The fact that a bridge is classified
as ‘‘structurally deficient’’ does not mean that it is unsafe for use by the public.

These  infrastructure  quality  numbers  for  bridges  should,  and  can,  be  improved,
but it is inaccurate to conclude that the Nation’s transportation infrastructure is un-
safe. We have quality control systems that provide surveillance over the design and
construction of bridges. We have quality control systems that oversee the operations
and  use  of  our  bridges.  And  we  have  quality  control  over  inspections  of  bridges  to
keep track of the attention that a bridge will require to stay in safe operation. These
systems have been developed over the course of many decades and are the products
of the best professional judgment of many experts. We will ensure that any findings
and  lessons  that  come  out  of  the  investigation  into  the  I–35W  bridge  collapse  are
quickly  learned  and  appropriate  corrective  actions  are  institutionalized  to  prevent
any future occurrence.
Bridge Research and Technology Programs

The  current  FHWA  bridge  research  program  is  focused  on  three  areas:  (1)  the
‘‘Bridge  of  the  Future,’’  (2)  effective  stewardship  and  management  of  the  existing
bridge  infrastructure  in  the  United  States,  and  (3)  assuring  a  high  level  of  safety,
security,  and  reliability  for  both  new  and  existing  highway  bridges  and  other  high-
way structures.

The  ‘‘Bridge  of  the  Future’’  is  intended  to  be  a  bridge  that  can  last  for  100  years
or  more,  and  require  minimal  maintenance  and  repair—while  being  adaptable  to
changing conditions, such as increasing loads or traffic volumes. FHWA’s bridge re-
search and technology (R&T) programs are focusing on improving the long-term per-
formance of our nation’s highway infrastructure in an effective yet economical way.
In  the  Safe,  Accountable,  Flexible,  Efficient  Transportation  Equity  Act:  A  Legacy
for Users (SAFETEA–LU), Congress authorized and funded research in five program
areas:  long-term  bridge  performance,  innovative  bridge  delivery,  high  performance
and  innovative  materials,  nondestructive  inspection  technology,  and  seismic  re-
search.  The  specific  programs  authorized  by  SAFETEA–LU  are  summarized  in  the
following:

Long-Term Bridge Performance
Long-Term Bridge Performance Program (LTBPP)—The  LTBPP  has  been  de-
signed as a 20-year effort that will include detailed inspections and periodic evalua-
tions  and  testing  on  a  representative  sample  of  bridges  throughout  the  United
States  in  order  to  monitor  and  measure  their  performance  over  an  extended  period
of  time.  The  program  will  collect  actual  performance  data  on  deterioration,  corro-
sion, or other types of degradation; structural impacts from overloads; and the effec-
tiveness of various maintenance and improvement strategies typically used to repair
or  rehabilitate  bridges.  The  resulting  LTBPP  database  will  provide  high  quality,

21

quantitative  performance  data  for  highway  bridges  that  will  support  improved  de-
signs, improved predictive models, and better bridge management systems.

Innovative Bridge Delivery
Innovative  Bridge  Research  and  Deployment  (IBRD)  Program—The  IBRD
program  encourages  highway  agencies  to  more  rapidly  accept  the  use  of  new  and
innovative materials and technologies or practices in highway structure construction
by  promoting,  demonstrating,  evaluating,  and  documenting  the  application  of  inno-
vative designs, materials, and construction methods in the construction, repair, and
rehabilitation  of  bridges  and  other  structures.  This  will  increase  safety  and  dura-
bility  and  reduce  construction  time,  traffic  congestion,  maintenance  costs,  and  life-
cycle costs of bridges.

High-Performance and Innovative Materials
High-Performance  Concrete  (HPC)  Research  and  Deployment  Program—
The  HPC  program  is  a  subset  of  the  IBRD  program.  It  continues  the  advancement
of HPC applications through targeted research that addresses needed improvements
in  design,  fabrication,  erection,  and  long-term  performance  in  order  to  achieve  the
Bridge  Program  strategic  outcomes.  HPC  research  focuses  on  material  and  casting
issues,  including  improved  performance  criteria,  lightweight  concrete,  curing,  and
test  methods;  structural  performance  concerns,  including  compression,  shear,  and
fatigue behavior for both seismic and non-seismic applications; and concepts related
to accelerated construction and bridge system design and performance.
High-Performing  Steel  (HPS)  Research  and  Technology  Program—The  HPS
research and technology transfer program is focused on resolving a number of issues
and  concerns  with  the  design,  fabrication,  erection,  and  long-term  performance  of
both  conventional  and  High  Performance  steels.  The  program  focuses  research  and
technology  transfer  and  education  in  the  areas  of  materials  and  joining  (for  exam-
ple, optimized welding processes and procedures); long-term performance (including
advanced knowledge on performance limitations of weathering steels and the poten-
tial  development  of  a  100-year  shop-applied  permanent  steel  coating  system);  inno-
vative  design  (including  testing  and  deployment  of  modular  steel  bridge  super-  and
substructure systems); and fabrication and erection tools and processes.
Ultra-High-Performance  Concrete  (UHPC)  Research  and  Technology—
UHPC is a unique material which is reinforced with short steel fibers, but requires
no  conventional  steel  reinforcing.  Prior  FHWA  research  on  UHPC  focused  on  basic
material  characterization,  and  the  development  of  optimized  structural  systems
using  this  very  high  performance,  but  costly,  material.  Under  the  UHPC  program,
additional work will be conducted to further understand the unique structural prop-
erties  of  this  material  and  assess  its  corrosion-resistance  properties,  while  address-
ing its use in other structural components including pre-cast bridge deck panels and
pre-stressed I- and bulb-tee girders.
Wood  Composite  Research—The  University  of  Maine  is  conducting  a  research
program  focused  in  the  development  and  application  of  wood/fiber  reinforced  poly-
mer  (FRP)  composite  materials  for  potential  use  as  primary  structural  members  in
highway bridges.

Non-destructive Inspection Technology
Steel  Bridge  Testing  Program—This  program  is  focused  on  the  further  develop-
ment  and  deployment  of  advanced  NDE  tools  that  can  be  used  to  detect  and  quan-
tify growing cracks in steel bridge members and welds. As described in SAFETEA–
LU,  the  NDE  technology  should  ultimately  be  able  to  detect  both  surface  and  sub-
surface  cracks,  in  a  field  environment,  for  flaws  as  small  as  0.010  inches  in  length
or depth.

Seismic Research
Seismic Research Program—The University of Nevada, Reno, and the State Uni-
versity of New York at Buffalo are conducting a seismic research program intended
to  increase  the  resilience  of  bridges  and  reduce  earthquake-induced  losses  due  to
highway damage.

FHWA  is  also  conducting  and  managing  a  number  of  other  important  bridge  re-
search  projects  in  conjunction  with  various  partners  and  stakeholder  groups,  all  fo-
cused  on  improving  the  performance  and  durability  of  our  Nation’s  highway

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:07 Jan 20, 2008 Jkt 037641 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL07\091907\37641 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

bridges—both  those  exposed  to  normal  everyday  traffic  and  use,  and  those  exposed
to the damaging effects of extreme natural and man-made hazards.

22

In  addition  to  FHWA,  there  are  a  number  of  other  organizations  that  sponsor
bridge  research,  and  a  much  larger  group  of  agencies  that  conduct  bridge  R&T.
These  include  State  DOTs,  industry,  other  federal  agencies,  and  academia.  Other
transportation modes also conduct limited bridge research, including the railroad in-
dustry.

FHWA actively coordinates the National research program with our partners and
stakeholders for agenda-setting, and in the conduct of research and delivery of new
innovations. Our staff participates in numerous national and international organiza-
tions  and  serves  on  committees  focused  on  bridge  research,  development,  and  tech-
nology transfer. We organize formal technical advisory groups and technical working
groups,  comprised  of  federal,  State,  and  local  transportation  officials;  bridge  engi-
neering consultants and industry groups; and academia to assist in the design, con-
duct, and delivery of the program.

An  important  R&T  partner  for  FHWA  is  the  University  Transportation  Centers
(UTC)  Program,  managed  by  the  Research  and  Innovative  Technology  Administra-
tion (RITA). FHWA works with the UTCs to identify opportunities for collaboration
that  will  increase  knowledge  and  skills  among  State  and  local  highway  agencies.
FHWA  holds  periodic  workshops  that  bring  together  researchers  and  practitioners
from FHWA, State DOTs, TRB, and UTCs to learn about each others’ interests and
capabilities,  new  research  opportunities,  and  technologies  under  development.
FHWA  held  an  infrastructure  workshop  for  UTCs  and  State  DOTs  at  Turner-
Fairbank Highway Research Center in March 2007. FHWA is working with a num-
ber  of  UTCs  on  transportation  research,  including  the  University  of  Tennessee,  the
University of Minnesota, Utah State University, Rutgers, and the University of Mis-
souri-Rolla.  RITA  also  consolidates  bridge  technology  information  from  all  the  De-
partment’s  modal  administrations  to  assist  us  in  having  the  best  available  tech-
nologies.

State  and  local  highway  agencies  learn  of  new  technologies  developed  by  UTCs
through  a  variety  of  events  sponsored  by  FHWA.  These  include  annual  workshops
show-casing  the  results  of  UTC  research  on  particular  topics,  and  numerous  con-
ferences, seminars and workshops co-sponsored with specific UTCs (for example, the
‘‘Self  Consolidating  Concrete  Workshop’’  at  South  Dakota  State  University).  FHWA
also  utilizes  its  highly  successful  Local  Technical  Assistance  Program  (LTAP)  as  a
mechanism  for  transferring  technologies  developed  through  the  UTC  program  to
State and local highway agencies, and tribal governments.

FHWA is also an active participant with the American Association of State High-
way  and  Transportation  Officials  (AASHTO)  in  technology  transfer  such  as  the
AASHTO  Technology  Implementation  Group  and  the  Joint  AASHTO/FHWA/Na-
tional  Cooperative  Highway  Research  Program  International  Technology  Exchange
Program,  more  commonly  known  as  the  International  Scanning  Program.  Recent
scans  have  included  a  scan  on  bridge  management,  and  a  follow-on  scan  in  2007
on  Bridge  Evaluation  Quality  Assurance.  The  2007  scan  identified  and  explored
bridge inspection processes in use in European countries.

Ultimately,  a  key  measure  of  success  of  any  highway  technology  depends  on  its
acceptance by stakeholders on a national scale. FHWA’s responsibilities for R&T in-
clude  not  only  managing  and  conducting  research,  but  also  sharing  the  results  of
completed research projects, and supporting and facilitating technology and innova-
tion  deployment.  FHWA’s  Resource  Center  is  a  central  location  for  obtaining  high-
way  technology  deployment  assistance.  (The  multiple  services  offered  by  the  Re-
source Center are listed at www.fhwa.dot.gov/resourcecenter/.) Education and train-
ing programs are provided through the FHWA NHI (www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov).

There  are  a  number  of  barriers  to  technology  deployment  that  may  explain  the
relatively  slow  adoption  of  highway  technologies  that  appear  cost  effective.  Lack  of
information about new technologies is one barrier that may be overcome with infor-
mation and outreach programs. Long-standing familiarity with existing technologies
gained  through  education  or  experience  also  may  hamper  the  adoption  of  newer
technologies. Education and training programs provided through the NHI often help
to transcend these types of barriers.

It  also  may  be  difficult  for  stakeholders  to  envision  the  long-range  benefits  of  a
new technology relative to initial investment costs, especially if the payback (break-
even)  period  is  long.  Even  if  stakeholders  are  aware  of  eventual  cost  savings  from
a more efficient or effective highway technology, they may have confidence in tradi-
tional  ways  of,  for  example,  assessing  pavement  performance.  Demonstration
projects  that  provide  hard  quantitative  data  can  help  tip  the  scales  so  that  stake-
holders are more willing to try and eventually regularly use innovative technologies.

23

Despite these efforts, technology deployment is also slowed by residual uncertain-
ties  about  performance,  reliability,  installation,  and  maintenance  costs;  availability
of  the  next  generation  of  the  technology;  and  the  need  for  the  necessary  technical
and  physical  infrastructure  to  support  the  technology  in  question.  These  persistent
barriers  can  be  addressed  with  outreach  programs  and  collaborative  efforts  with
stakeholders—ranging  from  the  TRB  to  researchers  within  State  DOTs—as  well  as
other  incentives  to  enhance  the  cost  effectiveness  of  new  technologies.  Taken  to-
gether,  these  initiatives  often  encourage  earlier  and  broader  adoption  of  highway
technologies by increasing stakeholder familiarity with new technologies.

One  such  program  is  FHWA’s  Highways  For  LIFE.  (http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/
hfl/hflfact.cfm). The purpose of Highways for LIFE is to advance long lasting high-
ways  using  innovative  technologies  and  practices  to  accomplish  fast  construction  of
efficient  and  safe  pavements  and  bridges,  with  the  overall  goal  of  improving  the
driving  experience  for  America.  The  program  includes  demonstration  construction
projects,  stakeholder  input  and  involvement,  technology  transfer,  technology  part-
nerships, information dissemination, and monitoring and evaluation. The innovative
technologies  that  the  Highways  for  LIFE  program  promotes  include  prefabricated
bridge elements and systems, road safety audits, and tools and techniques for ‘‘Mak-
ing Work Zones Work Better.’’

Perhaps  the  main  barrier  to  technology  deployment  is  the  general  lack  of  incen-
tive  mechanisms  to  encourage  the  deployment  of  new  technologies.  We  need  to  de-
velop better incentive mechanisms in the way the program is designed, the way we
procure, and the extent to which we rely on the private sector.

The  Missouri  Safe  and  Sound  Bridge  Improvement  Project  provides  an  example
of a potentially innovative way to improve incentives and encourage innovation and
private sector participation.

On May 25, 2007 the Department of Transportation approved a $600 million allo-
cation  of  Private  Activity  Bonds  to  the  Missouri  DOT  for  the  Missouri  Safe  and
Sound  Bridge  Improvement  Project.  The  allocation  will  be  made  available  to  two
short-listed bidders who are competing for a contract to bring 802 of Missouri’s low-
est  rated  bridges  up  to  satisfactory  condition  by  December  2012  and  keep  them  in
that  condition  for  at  least  25  years.  The  contract  will  be  awarded  largely  on  the
basis of the lowest level of ‘‘availability payments’’ that the bidder will accept to im-
prove  and  maintain  the  802  bridges.  Missouri  DOT  will  use  federal  formula  funds
to pay the availability payments.

SATETEA–LU authorized $15 billion in Private Activity Bonds. These bonds pro-
vide tax-exempt financing for private firms to carry out highway and surface freight
transfer projects. This innovative financing approach will allow Missouri to complete
these  much  needed  bridge  improvements  more  quickly  and,  it  is  hoped,  at  a  lower
cost.  Other  States,  including  Pennsylvania  and  North  Carolina,  are  also  interested
in this innovative approach.

Through  these  and  other  mechanisms,  FHWA  supports  the  development  and  im-
plementation  of  innovative  technology  deployment  practices  and  processes  through-
out the highway community.
Conclusion

The  I–35W  bridge  collapse  was  both  a  tragedy  and  wake-up  call  to  the  country.
The Department’s Inspector General will be monitoring all of the investigations into
the  collapse  and  reviewing  our  inspection  and  funding  programs  to  decide  and  ad-
vise us what short- and long-term actions we may need to take to improve the pro-
gram. Though we will have to wait for the NTSB’s report before we really know the
cause  of  the  collapse,  a  top-to-bottom  review  is  underway  to  make  sure  that  every-
thing  is  being  done  to  keep  this  kind  of  tragedy  from  occurring  again.  The  public
deserves to know and trust that our Nation’s highways are safe.

We  look  forward  to  continuing  to  work  with  Congress  to  give  the  people  of  this
Nation  the  safe,  efficient,  and  effective  transportation  system  that  they  expect  and
deserve.

Thank you again for this opportunity to testify. We will be pleased to answer any

questions you may have.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  HARRY  LEE  JAMES,  DEPUTY  EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR  AND  CHIEF  ENGINEER,  MISSISSIPPI  DEPART-
MENT  OF  TRANSPORTATION;  MEMBER,  STANDING  COM-
MITTEE  ON  HIGHWAYS,  AMERICAN  ASSOCIATION  OF  STATE
HIGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS
Mr. JAMES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to be here
today.  Again,  I  am  Harry  Lee  James.  I  am  the  Chief  Engineer  for
the  Mississippi  DOT.  I  am  also  the  former  State  Bridge  Engineer
for  the  Mississippi  Department  of  Transportation.  On  behalf  of
AASHTO, I would like to thank you for the focus of this committee
on  transportation  infrastructure  needs  and  particularly  bridges,
bridge  safety,  and  preservation;  and  hopefully  I  can  provide  you
with some information and answers to the questions that you have
previously provided to us.

As  far  as  bridge  inspection,  the  techniques  that  are  used  by  the
states today range from simple to complex; simple being the inspec-
tor going out, looking at the structure, touching it, feeling it, listen-
ing  to  it,  and  to  the  complex  inspections  that  require  ultrasound,
magnetic  particle  testing,  monitoring  devices  that  have  been
imbedded  in  a  bridge  during  its  construction  as  well.  Many  times
though  the  basic  is  the  best.  Keep  it  simple  so  that  we  can  mini-
mize the inconvenience to the public, because many times you have
to  close  a  bridge  or,  at  least,  some  lanes  of  traffic  when  you  are
performing  an  inspection,  and  also  for  the  safety  of  the  bridge  in-
spector  as  well.  Many  times  he  is  precariously  dangling  hundreds
of  feet  in  the  air  trying  to  manage  for  his  own  safety  as  well  as
a multitude of equipment that he might have to carry with him to
perform his tasks. Again, basic is best in most cases.

As  far  as  research,  there  is  always  a  greater  need.  We  need  to
continue our efforts to look for the next best thing. We continue to
use  proven  technologies  in  our  design  and  our  construction.  How-
ever, we can’t give up the fight for looking for new technologies out
there  to  help  us  looking  at  this  aging  infrastructure  that  we  have.
How do we prioritize our bridge repair and replacement needs at
the statewide level? There is no single approach, there is no magic
bullet.  We  just  have  to  go  out  there  and  do  what  we  can  with  the
resources  that  we  have.  It  takes  much  diligence  and  stewardship
on the part of the DOTs and Federal Highway to maintain the sys-
tems that we have. We are very fortunate that bridge management
systems have been helped in development by Federal Highway, and
many states have adopted these in their use to look at prioritizing
these repair and replacement programs that we have to do.

As  far  as  consequences  of  what  could  happen  short-term,  what
may  happen  long-term,  the  bridges  that  were  designed  and  built
back  in  the  ’30s  and  up  to  the  ’50s,  ’60s,  and  even  into  the  ’70s,
and  we  have  bridges  of  many  ages  on  our  system  of  some  16,000
in the State of Mississippi, those bridges, the ones particular on the
interstates, were designed back in the ’60s are not designed for the
loads  that  they  carry  today.  Consequently,  they  deteriorate  at  a
faster  level  than  what  was  originally  anticipated.  As  far  as  long-
term,  things  are  not  going  to  get  any  better.  We  can  build  some-
thing today a lot cheaper than we could build it five years ago with
the  current  increases  of  cost  of  construction  and  other  issues  that

26

we  have  to  deal  with  as  a  State  highway  agency.  More  is  always
needed to assist us.

One  thing  that  could  help  us  is  getting  projects  entered  into  our
work  program  at  a  faster  rate.  It  is  unfortunate  that  we  have  to
wait  until  a  tragedy  such  as  what  happened  in  Minnesota.  And
also  in  Mississippi,  we  lost  two  major  bridges  on  our  coast  from
Katrina;  it  takes  something  like  that  for  us  to  basically  suspend
the  rules  and  be  able  to  act  fast  to  get  something  back  in  service
in a timely manner.

It  is  very  challenging,  my  job,  to  look  at  a  state-wide  program
and  maintain  it.  We  have  the  traveling  public  that  we  have  to  see
to,  we  have  our  construction  workers,  as  well  as  our  contractors,
and safety is a big issue.

I  really  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  come  before  you  today  to
offer some information to you, and I will be glad to take any ques-
tions that you might have. Thank you.

[The prepared statement of Mr. James follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HARRY LEE JAMES

Introduction

Mr. Chairman, my name is Harry Lee James. I am the Deputy Executive Director
and Chief Engineer for the Mississippi Department of Transportation. I am a mem-
ber  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Highways  of  the  American  Association  of  State
Highway  and  Transportation  Officials  (AASHTO),  and  I  am  a  registered  Profes-
sional Engineer in the State of Mississippi.

On behalf of AASHTO, I want to express my appreciation for your focus on infra-
structure needs in America. The State Departments of Transportation (State DOTs)
consider  bridge  safety  and  bridge  preservation  to  be  one  of  our  highest  priorities,
and  we  take  this  responsibility  to  preserve  the  safety  and  mobility  of  the  traveling
public very seriously.

I  am  here  to  provide  you  and  the  public  with  the  answers  to  some  critical  ques-
tions  that  have  been  posed  by  the  House  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology
since the tragic collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis.
Question 1
A) What  technologies  and  techniques  do  state  departments  of  transpor-
tation  currently  use  to  inspect  bridges?  What  are  the  benefits  and  dis-
advantages?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:07 Jan 20, 2008 Jkt 037641 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL07\091907\37641 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

27

Every  state  conducts  a  thorough  and  continual  bridge  inspection  and  rehabilita-
tion  program.  America’s  bridges  are  inspected  every  two  years  by  trained  and  cer-
tified bridge inspectors, conditions are carefully monitored, and, where deterioration
is observed, corrective actions are taken.

The  most  common  and  widely  used  method  of  inspection  is  by  far  the  visual  in-
spections  by  teams  led  by  Professional  Engineers.  These  can  be  described  as  using
Sight,  Sound  and  Touch  for  General  Inspections.  Sight  is  the  normal  visual  inspec-
tion  technique  used  by  all  states,  Sound  refers  to  the  sounding  technique  (use  of
hammer  sounding  and  chain  drag)  on  concrete  to  integrity  of  the  concrete  (does  it
crumble),  and  Touch  refers  to  the  100  percent  hands  on  Fracture  Critical  Member
inspection  included  in  every  General  Inspection.  If  needed,  these  inspections  are
supplemented by other non-destructive testing methods.

The  benefit  of  visual  inspections  is  that  we  can  collect  a  large  volume  of  data  on
the  condition  of  the  components  of  every  bridge.  The  disadvantage  is  that  inspec-
tions  are  costly  and  time  consuming.  In  addition  to  qualitatively  documenting  visi-
ble  damage,  degradation,  and  distress  in  structural  elements,  visual  inspection  can
include quantitative measurements such as loss of steel due to corrosion or the size
of cracks in concrete.

Some other common Non-Destructive testing (NDT) techniques are Magnetic Par-
ticle method for detection of cracks in suspected areas, ground penetrating radar to
evaluate  bridge  decks  with  overlays,  infrared  thermography  and  ultrasonic  testing
to  identify  cracks  that  are  either  too  small  to  be  seen,  or  are  beneath  the  surface
of  the  metal  and  dye-penetrant  tests  which  also  detect  cracks  that  are  not  visible
to  the  naked  eye.  Dye-penetrant  tests  are  inexpensive  and  very  simple  to  perform.
Mag-particle  is  fairly  easy  to  perform.  The  disadvantages  are  that  dye-penetrant
only identifies cracks that have broken the surface of the steel. Mag-particle testing
requires relatively flat and smooth surfaces. Almost all the common technologies are
applicable  to  steel,  not  concrete  or  timber.  All  the  techniques  require  specialized
training and often times expensive equipment.

Some  other  innovative  techniques  include  special  ‘‘health  monitoring’’  of  bridges
include  strain  gauges,
using  special  gauges  and  sensors.  Some  of  these 
inclinometers, load cells, weather stations, corrosion sensors, humidity sensors, and
accelerometers.

Oregon is out front when it comes to using advanced technology to assess the con-
dition  of  bridges.  Currently  they  have  instruments  on  seven  bridges  and  have  in-
stalled  a  device  that  uses  air  pressure  to  measure  scour  at  bridge  foundations  on
one other bridge.

B) What research is needed to improve inspections?

The  National  Bridge  Inspection  Standards  are  periodically  reviewed  and  updated
to reflect the latest knowledge. The last update was implemented in January 2005.
The program was changed significantly in several areas:

• The  fracture-critical  inspection  interval  was  shortened  (not  to  exceed  24
months)  and  the  qualifications  for  underwater  inspectors  were  increased  (80
hours of training are now required).

• The  qualification  requirements  for  Program  Managers  and  Team  Leaders
were increased. For example, non-licensed engineers must take a 10-day class
and have five years experience, with most of that experience taking place di-
rectly in field inspection, to become a Team Leader.

• States  must  have  a  quality  control  and  assurance  program  in  place  for  their
bridge  inspection  program.  The  program  should  include  periodic  field  review
of inspection teams, periodic bridge inspection refresher training for program
managers and team leaders, and independent review of inspection reports and
computations.

These  recent  updates  to  the  National  Bridge  Inspection  Standards  demonstrate
that the Federal Highway Administration is diligent in updating and advancing in-
spection  standards  based  on  input  from  the  states.  In  addition,  states  frequently
supplement  federal  inspection  requirements  with  more  detailed  data  collection  and
analysis.  For  example,  40  states  currently  employ  an  element-level  inspection  proc-
ess that focuses on individual components of a structure.

In  an  informal  AASHTO  survey  conducted  on  Sept.  1st  to  which  27  states  and
the  USDA  Forest  Service  replied,  several  areas  of  research  were  determined  to  be
high  priority.  The  one  most  often  mentioned  was  the  need  for  non-destructive  test-
ing technology/equipment that is inexpensive and easy to operate for a ‘‘typical’’ in-
spector.  Also  needed  are  ways  to  effectively  manage  and  interpret  the  immense
amount of data that is produced by bridge monitoring systems. In addition, with all
of  the  pre-stressed  and  post-tensioned  structures  currently  being  built,  it  will  be
necessary  to  inspect  the  strands  in  these  structures  to  determine  the  operating

29

structural  capacity  of  these  bridges  after  they  have  been  in  service  and  exposed  to
the  environment  for  some  time.  An  effective  way  to  inspect  this  and  deterioration
of  pretensioned,  pre-stressed  strands  in  pre-cast  beams  and  boxes  is  needed.  Loss
of pre-stress concrete capacity can occur rapidly and lead to collapse such as the I–
70 bridge in Pennsylvania.

Additional  research  in  is  also  needed  in  ways  of  yielding  cost-effective,  efficient
methodologies  for  the  identification  and  monitoring  of  fatigue  cracks  in  steel  mem-
bers.  Lastly,  many  states  would  like  to  see  the  reinstatement  of  the  HERMES
ground penetrating radar research now tabled at Turner-Fairbank.

C) How is FHWA helping to meet these research needs?

The  Federal  Highway  Administration  (FHWA)  has  been  a  strong  supporter  of
bridge  research  and  bridge  inspection  and  evaluation  standards.  Due  to  small  staff
and limited resources, many local governments do not have the expertise to use the
technologies or review the research that is generated.

FHWA  works  cooperatively  with  the  American  Association  of  State  Highway  and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) to fund bridge related research projects through

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:07 Jan 20, 2008 Jkt 037641 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL07\091907\37641 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

30

the  Transportation  Research  Board  TRB  and  National  Cooperative  Highway  Re-
search  Projects  (NCHRP).  They  also  fund  bridge  research  projects  through  SHRP2.
FHWA funds have been used by the states and by AASHTO for software develop-
ment  projects  to  perform  structural  evaluation  of  existing  bridges  and  to  develop
bridge management tools. Most notably, FHWA funded a pilot project with Caltrans
in  the  early  1990’s  to  develop  bridge  management  software  that  contains  advanced
asset-management  decision-making  capabilities.  This  software  is  now  funded  by
AASHTO and is known as PONTIS. It is used nationally and internationally.

FHWA owns and operates the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center, which
provides  research  and  development  related  to  new  highway  technologies.  Current
bridge  inspection  technologies  being  developed  include  ground  penetrating  radar
(Hermes  II),  acoustic  emission  monitoring.  Bridge  technology  programs  operated
under  this  research  center  include  Non-Destructive  Evaluation  (NDE)  Validation
Center,  the  Long-Term  Bridge  Performance  Program  and  Paint  and  Corrosion  Lab-
oratories.

The  NDE  Validation  Center  is  designed  to  act  as  a  resource  for  state  transpor-
tation agencies, industry, and academia concerned with the development and testing
of innovative nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technologies.

The  Long-Term  Bridge  Performance  Program  (LTBP)  was  launched  earlier  this
year. It is 20-year research effort that is strategic in nature with specific short- and
long-term  goals.  The  program  will  include  detailed  inspection,  periodic  evaluation
and  testing,  continuous  monitoring,  and  forensic  investigation  of  representative
samples of bridges throughout the United States to capture and document their per-
formance. We feel this is an important program because it has the potential to pro-
vide  a  better  understanding  of  bridge  deterioration  and  to  provide  better  deteriora-
tion models than are now used in Pontis.

FHWA  sponsors  studies  to  develop  inspection  techniques  and  remedies  for  com-
mon  problems  found  in  the  Nation’s  inventory  of  bridges  such  as  arresting  fatigue
cracks, detecting and preventing protecting bridge with chlorides in concrete, detect-
ing and preventing development of reactive aggregate.

Recently, the Federal Highway Administration’s Transportation System Preserva-
tion  program,  an  initiative  of  the  Asset  Management  division,  has  added  Bridge
Preservation  to  the  program.  Several  workshops  have  been  held  in  2007  and  these
workshops  have  helped  to  identify  needed  research  in  the  area  of  bridge  preventa-
tive maintenance.

Also,  the  International  Activities  office  of  FHWA  has  sponsored  several  inter-
national  scan  tours  in  the  area  of  Bridge  inspection  and  quality  control.  Most  re-
cently, a European Scan was undertaken in June 2007 in the area of Bridge Quality
Control  and  Quality  Assurance.  Additionally,  FHWA  works  to  help  sponsor  Trans-
portation  Pooled  Funds  which  support  specific  research  projects  Federal  Highways
also provides training through the National Highway Institute and helps to dissemi-
nate  information  through  many  publications,  reports,  memos  and  announcements.
While substantial funding has been devoted to bridge research, since the passage
of  SAFETEA–LU  research  funding  has  been  constrained.  Two  factors  give  rise  to
that  constraint.  First,  overall  research  funding  was  less  than  recommended  by
AASHTO and second, earmarks exceeded the total dollars made available for FHWA
research and thus constrained overall discretionary research.

The pending SAFETEA–LU Technical Corrections bill that passed the House and
is pending in the Senate would free up additional funds for the FHWA research pro-
gram  with  no  need  to  increase  the  overall  cost  of  SAFETEA–LU.  AASHTO  has
urged passage of this important legislation.
Bridge Research Under SHRP 2

Recent  events  have  again  demonstrated  that  America’s  highways,  once  the  envy
of the world, are deteriorating, sometimes disastrously so. Through age and overuse
their  capacity  to  safely  serve  America’s  transportation  needs  is  being  compromised.
The Renewal focus area of the Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP
2)  seeks  to  develop  the  tools  needed  to  systematically  ‘‘renew’’  our  highway  infra-
structure  to  serve  the  21st  century  in  ways  that  are  rapid,  minimally  disruptive  to
users,  communities,  and  the  environment  and  that  yield  much  longer-lived  bridges
and roadways.

Highway  infrastructure  largely  comprises  three  basic  elements:  bridges,  pave-
ments and earthworks. All three elements are showing the deterioration of age and
over-use and all three are addressed in the SHRP 2 research plans. While all three
elements are vulnerable to deterioration that might compromise the physical safety
of  highway  users,  bridges  are,  by  far,  the  most  vulnerable.  This  fact  was  not  lost
on  the  committees  of  experts  that  guided  the  formulation  of  the  SHRP  2  research,
and  renewal  of  America’s  highway  bridges  remains  a  key  element  of  the  SHRP  2

research,  despite  the  dramatic  reduction  in  funds  actually  authorized  in  the
SAFETEA–LU legislation. Unfortunately, some of the originally planned research—
directly applicable to safety assessment and the maintenance and repair of existing
structures—proved unaffordable.
Bridge Research Currently Included in SHRP 2

Three  current  projects,  with  total  funding  of  $5  million,  directly  address  bridge
renewal,  including  ‘‘Durable  Bridges  for  Service  Life  beyond  100  Years:  Innovative
Systems, Subsystems, and Components.’’

Two other projects, valued at $8 million, address bridge renewal in part, including
one  project  related  to  ‘‘A  Plan  for  Developing  High-Speed,  Nondestructive  Testing
Procedures for Both Design Evaluation and Construction Inspection.’’

Bridge Research Included in the Original SHRP 2 Research Plans

TEA–21  called  for  the  Transportation  Research  Board  (TRB)  to  conduct  a  study
to  determine  the  goals,  purposes,  research  agenda  and  projects,  administrative
structure, and fiscal needs for a new strategic highway research program or a simi-
lar effort. Among the recommendations of the committee as detailed in TRB Special
Report 260, was that ‘‘Highway Renewal’’ be included as one of the four focus areas
of SHRP 2. A subsequent detailed analysis of highway renewal research needs alone
indicated a funding need of approximately $95 million.

However,  the  passage  of  SAFETEA–LU  provided  only  $150  million  for  the  entire
SHRP 2 research effort; thus serious cutbacks were made in all four research focus
areas.  Funding  available  for  highway  renewal  research  was  reduced  to  $30  million.
Efforts to optimize the research plans and combine projects were undertaken. None-
theless, five important bridge research projects were dropped from the SHRP 2 pro-
gram, including such topics as ‘‘Bridge Repair/Strengthening Systems,’’ ‘‘Techniques
for Retrofitting Bridges with Non-Redundant Structural Members,’’ and ‘‘Monitoring
and Design of Structures For Improved Maintenance and Security.’’

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:07 Jan 20, 2008 Jkt 037641 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL07\091907\37641 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

32

These  projects  would  be  as  valuable  to  the  safety  assessment,  maintenance  man-
agement, and repair of existing bridges as they would be to a program of systematic
renewal.  Statements  of  work  have  already  been  developed  for  these  research
projects.  The  cost  estimates  shown  are  bare  minimums  and  may  require  some  up-
ward adjustment.

TRB is ready to coordinate the SHRP 2 research with any program pursuing this
research.  The  research  remains  significant  to  the  achievement  of  the  overall  SHRP
2 goals.
Question 2
A) For those bridges deemed structurally deficient, how do state and local

governments prioritize repairs and replacements?

The states use a number of different methods to prioritize their bridge needs.
While  there  is  no  ‘‘single  approach’’  to  prioritizing  bridge  program  candidates,  all
approaches consider safety, then preservation and serviceability. Many states use a
priority  type  of  formula  or  a  ranking  system.  These  formulas  and  rankings  taking
into  effect  a  combination  variables  of  many  different  types.  Some  of  the  common
considerations,  in  addition  to  the  structurally  condition  ratings,  are  load  ratings,
field  conditions,  available  funding,  importance  (criticality)  of  the  bridge,  average
daily traffic, and alternate or detour route length. In addition to asset management
programs  and  rankings,  projects  are  scrutinized  and  approved  through  the  normal
STIP  process  that  includes  approvals  from  State  and  local  transportation  leaders
and the transportation commissions where applicable.

One  example  is  Oregon’s  project  selection  method.  It  integrates  inspection  data
from  PONTIS  with  other  bridge  condition  data,  specifically  non-deterioration  based
needs,  including,  as  examples;  seismic,  scour,  and  functional  deficiencies.  ODOT
links  various  data  collections  to  identify  projects  in  twelve  categories.  Data  pri-
marily  from  Pontis  is  used  to  select  problem  bridges  in  the  substructure,  super-
structure,  and  deck  condition  categories.  Data  outside  of  Pontis  is  used  to  select
problem bridges in the seismic, scour, bridge rail, deck width, load capacity, vertical
clearance, paint, coastal bridge (cathodic protection), and movable bridge categories.
Many  states  are  moving  away  from  a  strictly  ‘‘worst  first’’  project  selection  proc-
ess. Increases in the costs of traffic mobility and project staging have also influenced
the move toward targeting route segments for repair and replacement projects.

However, several states are also still using a ‘‘worst first’’ selection method, some-
times with consideration for traffic load, social effects and politics. Overall, there is
no ‘‘norm’’ in the area of prioritization.
Michigan’s Well Developed Bridge Management System

Michigan  DOT  has  a  well  developed  asset  management  program  that  preserves
Michigan’s  bridge  through  a  balanced  approach  of  doing  capital  preventive  mainte-
nance,  rehabilitation,  and  replacement.  They  use  a  forecasting  tool  called  Bridge
Condition  Forecast  System  to  determine  the  best  implementable  strategy  of  the
three  types  of  work.  Today  the  mix  of  fixes  is  18  percent  Preventive  Maintenance,
30 percent rehabilitation, and 48 percent replacement.

The  department  also  uses  AASHTO  CoRe  elements  and  Pontis  smart  flags  to
make  project  level  decisions,  track  deterioration  rate  of  bridge  elements  (transition
probabilities). Progress is monitored each year towards defined condition state goals,
and strategy is modified as needed. By slowing the deterioration rate of fair bridges

33

(keeping  them  from  becoming  structurally  deficient  (SD) )  and  concentrating  on  re-
habilitating  (first  option)  and  replacement  of  SD  bridges,  the  state  has  been  able
to  make  good  progress  at  eliminating  Structurally  deficient  bridges.  Local  agencies
have  reengineered  their  program  (once  called  critical  bridge  program,  but  today
called  local  agency  bridge  program),  following  the  lead  of  the  state  trunkline  pro-
gram, and they are now managing their network of local agency structures.

While  doing  this  the  state  has  found  the  federal  regulations  regarding  the  High-
way  Bridge  Program  (HBP)  are  still  too  restrictive  (although  improving).  This  has
resulted  in  several  states  transferring  money  out  of  the  HBP  program  into  other
less  restrictive  programs.  This  gives  a  false  impression  that  bridge  money  is  not
needed, which is very misleading. The HBP program is becoming more flexible with
the  allowance  to  use  HBP  funds  for  painting  bridges  and  preventive  maintenance,
however,  it  is  still  built  upon  the  framework  of  the  30  year  old  sufficiency  rating
formula that assigns a rating based upon structural deficiency and functional obso-
lescence.

In  the  latest  federal  highway  legislation,  SAFETEA–LU,  the  name  of  the  portion
of  the  act  providing  funding  for  bridge  improvement  and  preservation  was  changed
from  ‘‘Highway  Bridge  Rehabilitation  and  Replacement  Program’’  (HBRRP)  to
‘‘Highway  Bridge  Program’’  (HBP).  Along  with  the  name  change,  came  increased
flexibility for states, counties, and cities to fund a broader assortment of bridge pres-
ervation  projects.  For  example,  ‘‘systematic  preventive  maintenance’’  now  qualifies
for  HBP  funds.  With  this  change,  it  now  appears  that  the  three  broad  categories
of  bridge  preservation  are  covered;  i.e.,  replacement,  rehabilitation  and  preventive
maintenance.  However,  there  remains  at  least  one  important  exception  that  pre-
vents  the  HBP  program  from  becoming  what  it  can  and  should  be.  As  it  currently
stands,  HBP  funds  still  cannot  be  used  for  rehabilitation  or  replacement  of  bridge
decks  when  only  the  deck  is  in  poor  condition.  The  reason  for  this  is  explained
below.

Bridges  qualify  for  rehabilitation  and  replacement  based  upon  the  ‘‘Sufficiency
Rating Formula, as explained in Appendix B of the FHWA’s ‘‘Recording and Coding
Guide for the Structure Inventory and Appraisal of the Nation’s Bridges.’’ The suffi-
ciency rating formula is a 100-point scale. A bridge in new condition, having no defi-
ciencies, has 100 points, and each deficiency on a bridge reduces the structure’s suf-
ficiency  rating  by  a  predetermined  value.  When  a  bridge’s  sufficiency  rating  falls
below 80 points, the bridge qualifies for rehabilitation, and when the sufficiency rat-
ing falls below 50 points, the bridge qualifies for replacement.

The  problem,  as  it  relates  to  bridge  decks,  is  the  formula  gives  very  little  weight
to the condition of a bridge deck. The formula only lowers a bridge’s sufficiency rat-
ing three points when the deck condition (NBI Item #58) is four (poor). It only low-
ers  the  sufficiency  rating  five  points  when  the  deck  condition  is  three  (serious)  or
below.  In  comparison,  the  formula  lowers  a  Bridge’s  sufficiency  rating  25  points
when, either, the superstructure (NBI Item #59) or the substructure (NBI Item #60)
conditions are four (poor). The formula lowers a bridge’s sufficiency rating 40 points,
and 55 points, when the condition of the superstructure or substructure is three (se-
rious)  or  two  (critical),  respectively.  As  a  result,  if  only  a  bridge  deck  is  rated  poor,
the bridge does not qualify for HBP funds.

To  qualify  preventive  maintenance  activities  for  HBP  funds,  states  must  work
with  their  FHWA  division  office  to  demonstrate  they  have  a  ‘‘systematic  plan’’  for
maintaining  their  bridges.  Once  a  ‘‘systematic  plan’’  is  demonstrated,  a  list  of  HBP
eligible preventive maintenance activities can be developed. In Michigan, preventive
maintenance  activities  relating  to  bridge  decks  include  deck  patching,  expansion
joint replacement, epoxy overlays, and hot mix asphalt overlays. Rigid overlays (i.e.
*  concrete,  latex  modified  concrete,  or  micro-silica  concrete)  are  classified  as  reha-
bilitation  projects,  therefore  a  bridge  must  meet  the  more  stringent  sufficiency  rat-
ings as discussed above.

Rigid  overlays  are  a  well-proven  cost  effective  preservation  activity  for  bridge
decks,  especially  those  that  receive  large  traffic  volumes.  Likewise,  it  is  easily
shown that it is cost effective to rehabilitate or replace structurally deficient bridge
decks before more extensive damage is done to the superstructure and substructure.
It  simply  does  not  make  sense  to  exclude  rehabilitation  and  replacement  of  bridges
decks  from  HBP  funds  when  the  rest  of  the  structure  is  in  fair  to  good  condition.
This is like saying you should not replace or repair the shingles on your home’s roof
until  moisture  has  been  allowed  to  penetrate  and  destroy  the  drywall  or  crack  the
foundation.

By definition, a bridge is ‘‘structurally deficient’’ if any one of the three major ele-
ments  is  rated  four  (poor)  or  below.  Consequently,  if  only  the  bridge  deck  is  rated
four  (poor)  or  below,  the  bridge  is  structurally  deficient.  This  is  an  important  point
to be aware of because Section 1114 of SAFETEA–LU ‘‘declares that it is in the vital

interest  of  the  United  States  that  a  highway  bridge  program  be  carried  out  to  en-
able States to improve the condition of their highway bridges over waterways, other
topographical  barriers,  other  highways,  and  railroads  through  replacement  and  re-
habilitation of bridges that the States and the Secretary determine are structurally
deficient  or  functionally  obsolete  and  through  systematic  preventative  maintenance
of  bridges’’.  Therefore,  allowing  rehabilitation  or  replacement  of  structurally  defi-
cient bridge decks is consistent and directly supported by SAFETEA–LU.

It  is  also  important  that  to  remember  and  convey  that  bridges  do  not  exist  in  a
vacuum. Bridges are always tied to the roads they connect. Many of the structurally
deficient  bridges  we  have  are  located  on  major  freeways  that  are  tied  up  in  long-
term  corridor  improvement  studies,  or  there  simply  is  not  enough  money  to  do  the
needed  improvement  to  the  corridor  or  interchange.  The  bridge  may  need  replace-
ment,  but  that  must  go  along  with  a  freeway  widening  (adding  lanes),  or  redesign
of  an  interchange.  In  many  cases,  we  can  not  just  simply  fix  the  bridges  without
doing major road improvements also.
Bridge Management Software

Currently,  43  states  plus  Puerto  Rico  and  the  District  of  Columbia,  along  with
several  local  agencies  (including  Los  Angeles  and  Phoenix)  and  six  international
agencies, use an AASHTO BRIDGEWare®  software program called Pontis®. This is
a computer-based bridge management system developed to assist in the challenging
task  of  managing  an  agency’s  structures.  Pontis  can  store  bridge  inventory  and  in-
spection  data,  formulate  network-wide  preservation  and  improvement  policies  for
use  in  evaluating  the  needs  of  each  bridge  in  a  network,  and  make  recommenda-
tions  for  what  projects  to  include  in  an  agency’s  capital  plan  for  deriving  the  max-
imum benefit from limited funds.

Once  inspection  data  have  been  entered,  Pontis  can  be  used  for  maintenance
tracking  and  federal  reporting.  Pontis  integrates  the  objectives  of  public  safety  and
risk  reduction,  user  convenience,  and  preservation  of  investment  to  produce  budg-
etary, maintenance, and program policies. Additionally, it provides a systematic pro-
cedure  for  the  allocation  of  resources  to  the  preservation  and  improvement  of  the
bridges  in  a  network.  Pontis  accomplishes  this  by  considering  both  the  costs  and
benefits  of  maintenance  policies  versus  investments  in  improvements  or  replace-
ments.

Responses  from  an  informal  August  2007  AASHTO  survey11  found  that  17  of  37
states  use  an  in-house  computerized  bridge  management  system  that  allows  for
prioritization and monitoring of elements in conjunction with either Pontis data col-
lection  or  an  in-house  database.  In  some  cases,  Pontis  is  used  by  the  states  as  a
data  collection  system  only,  but  many  states  are  also  using  the  management  capa-
bilities  of  Pontis,  which  allow  them  to  predict  bridge  element  deterioration  levels
and prioritize spending.

As noted, most states have some form of computerized bridge management system
in  place;  however,  the  complexity  and  abilities  vary.  The  goal  of  this  effort  may  be
to better define the abilities a state should have within its bridge management sys-
tem and allow for flexibility within each state to accomplish these goals in the most
efficient manner possible.
B) What are the possible short- and long-term consequences of maintaining
the current level of bridge repair and replacement efforts (if no changes
are made to the current systems)?

Most  states  responding  to  the  AASHTO  informal  survey  cite  that  their  systems
will  not  be  affected  greatly  in  the  short-term  if  there  are  no  changes  made.  How-
ever,  most  stated  that  long-term  effects  of  an  unchanging  system  would  be  signifi-
cant.  One  example  can  be  seen  in  Utah,  where  approximately  five  percent  of  the
State system is Structurally Deficient. UDOT has developed and maintains strategic
goals  and  performance  measures  for  the  overall  health  of  its  bridge  system,  as  do
many other states. Historically, funding from the Federal Bridge Programs (HPRR)
is  not  adequate  to  address  all  of  the  needs.  Therefore  Utah’s  program  is  supple-
mented  with  State  funds  for  both  bridge  replacement  and  preventive  programs.
Even  with  the  supplemental  State  funds,  resources  are  not  adequate  to  address  all
of the Structurally Deficient bridges.

The  consequence  of  inadequate  funding  includes  increased  risk.  Typically  states
manage the risk of structurally deficient bridges with a variety of processes includ-
ing;  more  frequent  inspections,  and  consideration  for  load  restrictions,  shoring,  and
possible  closure  of  a  bridge.  There  are  a  large  number  of  bridges  that  were  built
during the ‘‘Interstate Era.’’ Many of these bridges are already functionally obsolete,
and  many  more  will  become  functionally  obsolete  as  traffic  volumes  increase.  More
importantly,  the  volume  of  freight  is  expected  to  double  in  the  next  20  years,  and

35

the  long-term  trend  in  the  industry  has  been  for  increased  vehicle  weight  and  axle
loads.  Improvements  in  tire  technology  will  allow  even  greater  axle  loads,  and  the
expanded  use  of  drop  axles  has  resulted  in  vehicles  with  concentrated  loading  that
far exceeds the standard vehicles used for load rating.

There has been insufficient funding to replace bridges at a sustainable rate. If the
funding  is  maintained  at  current  levels,  this  trend  will  continue  and  the  average
bridge  age  will  continue  to  increase,  while  the  conditions  continue  to  decrease.
Bridges  will  deteriorate  faster  than  they  can  be  repaired  and/or  replaced.  This  will
require load limiting (posting) of bridges and/or the closing of bridges. Thus limiting
the  use  of  the  existing  transportation  system—significantly  impacting  the  Nation’s
economy.

A funding program is needed that will allow states to ‘‘sustain’’ an efficient trans-
portation system for the distant future. Since bridges have a 50 to 100 year lifespan,
the results of a non-sustainable funding program are not immediately apparent, but
will  nonetheless  result  in  significant  impacts  to  the  economy  if  not  dealt  with  at  a
level that will ‘‘sustain’’ the efficiency needed for economic growth.

Some states report that, in the short-term, failure to maintain SD bridges will ne-
cessitate costly ‘‘emergency’’ repairs to allow routes to remain open at required func-
tional  levels.  These  emergency  repairs  reduce  funds  available  for  more  permanent
and cost effective rehabilitations
Is Current Bridge Investment Adequate?

It  should  be  noted  that  currently  states  are  spending  dramatically  more  money
on bridges than is provided under the federal Bridge Program. For example, in 2004
the  federal  Highway  Bridge  Program  provided  $5.1  billion  to  the  states.  That  year,
states  actually  spent  $6.6  billion  in  federal  aid  for  bridge  rehabilitation.  State  and
local  funding  added  another  $3.9  billion  for  bridge  repairs.  FHWA  reports  that  in
2004  a  total  of  $10.5  billion  was  invested  in  bridge  improvements  by  all  levels  of
government.

Oregon’s  10-year  state  bonding  program  is  providing  $1.3  billion  of  state  funding
for  the  rehabilitation  of  hundreds  of  deficient  bridges.  This  is  twice  the  amount  re-
ceived in federal bridge funding.

According to U.S. DOT’s 2006 Conditions and Performance Report, the backlog of
needed  repairs  on  National  Highway  System  bridges  alone  total  over  $32  billion,
which  includes  over  $19  billion  needed  on  Interstate  Highway  System  bridges.
Structurally  deficient  bridges  on  the  National  Highway  System  only  represent  one-
tenth of the total number of structurally deficient bridges on the U.S. road network.
As  wear  and  tear  on  our  nation’s  infrastructure  continues,  it  will  only  continue  to
increase the needs in coming years.

The  Conditions  and  Performance  report  also  states  that  maintaining  the  current
investment level of $10.5 billion annually would reduce the backlog of bridge needs
by half over the next 20 years. An increase in that investment level to $12.4 billion
per  year  for  bridge  system  rehabilitation  would  eliminate  the  backlog  by  2024,  ex-
cluding any kind of necessary spending on expansion or enhancements.

In  addition  to  providing  needed  additional  funding,  we  recommend  investigating
what  can  be  done  to  streamline  processes  that  delay  the  implementation  of  needed
repairs  on  our  nation’s  highway  system,  including  reducing  environmental  red  tape
and allowing the use of proprietary engineering-related products that could spur in-
novation in long-term solutions.

During  the  last  reauthorization  of  the  federal  transportation  bill,  SAFETEA–LU
gradually  increased  annual  funding  levels  for  the  Highway  Bridge  Program  by  six
percent  over  the  life  of  the  bill  (from  FY  2005  to  FY  2009).  However,  far  outpacing
that  increased  funding  have  been  dramatic  increases  in  materials  costs  for  steel,
concrete,  fuel,  asphalt.  States  report  that  prices  jumped  46  percent  over  the  years
from  2003–2006.  In  addition,  the  Conditions  and  Performance  report  attributes  in-
creases in the ‘‘cost to maintain highways’’ to the rising cost of construction in large
urbanized  areas  due  to  environmental  mitigation  and  construction  strategies  (such
as night work) intended to reduce the impacts of work zones on users.

Aside  from  the  well-documented  dramatic  increases  in  construction  costs,  there
have been equally dramatic increases in traffic, especially heavy trucks, on the Na-
tion’s major highways. Today, the average mile of Interstate highway carries 10,500
trucks  per  day.  By  2035,  that  number  is  expected  to  more  than  double  to  22,700
trucks per day.

The  truck  issue  also  extends  to  overweight  vehicles.  As  an  example,  in  Iowa,  the
DOT’s  Bridge  Office  issues  an  average  of  50  permits  per  day  for  trucks  weighing
over  156,000  pounds,  or  approximately  7,500  permits  per  year.  These  trucks  are
roughly  twice  the  standard  ‘‘legal’’  weight  limit,  causing  significant  wear  and  tear

on the system, but are necessary for the economic health of our country. And these
numbers are only anticipated to increase.

Thus, we are left with a system that has challenges to meet, and a program that

does not have enough funding to overcome the current backlog.
Question 3
A) How  do  State  and  local  governments  use  the  results  of  research  and

technology development by the Federal Government?

Many  states  work  closely  with  the  FHWA,  AASHTO,  and  other  groups  to  share
technology  with  local  government  agencies  and  consultants.  In  addition,  training
programs such as the National Highway Institute, Library sessions, and Webinar’s,
are  used  to  exchange  information.  Similar  to  any  field,  advances  in  highway  infra-
structure typically are the result of cumulative improvements over time from many
sources instead of major breakthroughs. The Departments of Defense, Energy, Com-
merce, and Transportation all contributed to the state-of-the-art in structural steels,
corrosion-resistant materials, Portland cement concrete, and asphaltic concrete that
are  now  routinely  used  for  highways.  In  addition  to  the  materials,  designs,  and
practice that are currently in use, reports and research papers stemming from Fed-
eral Government programs are routinely referenced by practitioners and researchers
at  State  and  local  DOTs  to  make  decisions  on  using  a  new  technology  or  pursuing
further research into a new technology.

There are many excellent reports that are produced through the National Cooper-
ative  Highway  Research  Program,  under  the  direction  of  the  Transportation  Re-
search  Board  of  the  National  Academies.  These  reports  let  states  know  what  the
leaders in certain areas are doing. Taking the time to read reports and learn about
what  others  have  done  enables  individual  states  to  avoid  the  expense  and  time  of
learning  the  lessons  that  have  already  been  learned  by  others.  For  example,  the
NCHRP  ‘‘Manual  for  Bridge  Rating  Through  Load  Testing’’  has  excellent  guidance
for  bridge  owners  to  test  older  bridges  that  have  low  calculated  load  capacity  yet
are not deteriorated and seem to be performing well.

The  results  of  many  federal  research  projects  are  used  to  implement  changes  to
design  philosophies  and  inspection  techniques.  Recent  examples  include  the  migra-
tion of our design philosophy to LRFD, the addition of new SU type rating vehicles
to  the  current  federal  rating  vehicles  (Type  3,  3S2,  3–3),  etc.  States  use  the  results
of  research  from  sources  such  as  NCHRP  for  the  inspection,  testing  and  analysis
of  bridges,  when  the  results  of  the  projects  are  directly  implemented  into  the
AASHTO bridge design, maintenance and analysis codes or when the results of the
research is published.

In  addition,  most  states  enroll  DOT  staff  in  National  Highway  Institute  (NHI)
courses  for  technical  training.  NHI  courses  are  developed  with  the  help  of  Federal
Government  and  participate  in  federally  sponsored  conference  and  workshops  to
seek information on new technologies.
B) How  do  federal  technology  transfer  programs  for  bridge-related  re-

search and technology development help the states?

Technology  transfer  programs,  such  as  organizing  conferences  and  NHI  courses,
assist  states  in  being  aware  of  the  current  state-of-the-practice.  Peer  exchange  pro-
grams help peers to meet and discuss best practices and issues they face every day.
The states encourage FHWA to develop periodic bridge inspection/management peer
exchange programs and program peer reviews to facilitate more discussions and im-
provements.

The  Technology  Transfer  (T2)  program,  National  Highway  Institute,  and  other
program are extremely helpful in sharing information. The T2 program is very bene-
ficial  in  that  it  has  a  dedicated  staff  to  administer  the  program,  reducing  workload
for  DOT  and  FHWA  personnel.  More  information  on  T2  can  be  found  at:  http://
www.federallabs.org/.  The  Federal  Laboratory  Consortium  for  Technology  Transfer
(FLC)  is  the  nationwide  network  of  federal  laboratories  that  provides  the  forum  to
develop strategies and opportunities for linking laboratory mission technologies and
expertise with the marketplace. The FLC was organized in 1974 and formally char-
tered  by  the  Federal  Technology  Transfer  Act  of  1986  to  promote  and  strengthen
technology transfer nationwide. Today, more than 250 federal laboratories and cen-
ters and their parent departments and agencies are FLC members.

In  many  federally  sponsored  technology  transfer  events,  individuals  with  many
years  of  experience  are  able  to  share  what  technology  had  worked  for  them,  and
what  technology  had  fallen  short.  This  was  an  excellent  forum  to  learn  about  the
research  being  done  on  a  recently  developed  paint  that  holds  promise  for  a  signifi-
cantly  longer  service  life.  Without  technology  transfer  programs,  individual  states
would  not  benefit  from  the  lessons  of  others  and  would  have  to  rely  exclusively  on

vendor information. One example of these types of events were two Bridge Preserva-
tion  Workshops  held  earlier  this  year.  These  workshops  enabled  engineers  from  all
states  to  gather  together  and  discuss  issues  related  to  bridge  management  and
maintenance.

In  addition,  technology  transfer  and  programs  such  as  the  Innovative  Bridge  Re-
search  and  Deployment  Program  (IBRD)  provide  a  means  to  disseminate  informa-
tion,  experience  and  ‘‘lessons  learned’’  that  allow  states  to  use  new  materials  such
as  high  strength  steel  and  high  performance  concrete  more  efficiently.  More  infor-
mation on IBRD can be found at: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/ibrd/
C) What  technical  assistance  have  state  and  local  governments  received
from  the  U.S.  DOT  for  steel  truss  bridge  inspections  following  the
bridge collapse in Minneapolis? Was this technical assistance helpful?

Since  August  1,  in  compliance  with  federal  requests,  every  state  has  reviewed  or

is in the process of re-inspecting its steel deck truss bridges.

Most  states  noted  that  although  their  FHWA  division  office  let  them  know  they
were available to assist, no assistance from them was needed or solicited. However,
several  states  noted  and  appreciated  the  numerous  forms  of  technical  assistance
provided by FHWA ranging from Technical Advisories, copies of reports, updates on
emergency  efforts,  national  teleconferences,  and  meetings  with  the  local  FHWA  of-
fice.  A  few  states  also  noted  that  the  technical  advisories  did  provide  a  basis  for  a
uniform national response in light of the I–35 collapse in Minnesota.

In  Georgia,  it  was  noted  that  the  FHWA  Division  participated  in  the  inspections
of  GDOT’s  two  steel  deck  truss  bridge  structures  and  GDOT  appreciated  their  par-
ticipation in the inspections.
Conclusion

We  continue  to  make  progress  in  addressing  bridge  replacement  and  rehabilita-
tion needs, but there just isn’t enough money to close the gap. Each year, as bridges
continue to age and deteriorate, it is an uphill battle to keep up with the demands.
AASHTO and the State DOTs stand ready to help Congress address the needs for
transportation  infrastructure  in  America.  The  tragic  Minneapolis  bridge  collapse
rightly  raises  concerns  about  the  condition  and  needs  of  the  Nation’s  bridges.
AASHTO  and  the  State  DOTs  continue  to  work  with  NTSB  and  others  as  they  in-
vestigate  the  cause  of  this  tragic  event,  and  when  a  cause  has  been  identified  we
are  committed  to  working  jointly  with  Congress  to  address  the  issue  head-on  and
to  correct  the  situation  in  the  most  expedient  way  possible.  Until  that  time,  it  is
important  to  avoid  premature  speculations,  and  diligently  obtain  all  relevant  data
to arrive at the appropriate solution.

BIOGRAPHY FOR HARRY LEE JAMES

After having earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in Civil Engineering (with hon-
ors)  from  Mississippi  State  University  (MSU)  in  1976,  Harry  Lee  James  worked  in
the  private  construction  industry  and  later  for  a  consulting  engineering  firm  before
joining  the  MDOT  team  as  a  bridge  designer  in  1982.  Mr.  James  was  appointed
State Bridge Engineer in 1999, and in February 2003 he was appointed to the posi-
tion  of  Deputy  Executive  Director/Chief  Engineer.  Because  of  his  focus  on  bridges
throughout  his  career,  this  appointment  has  given  Mr.  James  the  unique  oppor-
tunity and obligation to promote better and safer bridges.

Mr.  James  is  a  licensed  Professional  Engineer  and  a  licensed  Professional  Land
Surveyor  in  Mississippi.  He  serves  on  the  American  Association  of  State  Highway
Officials’  (AASHTO)  Standing  Committee  on  Highways,  he  is  a  member  of  the  Na-
tional  Cooperative  Highway  Research  Program  (NCHRP)  12–62  Panel,  and  he  was
formerly  on  the  AASHTO  Subcommittee  on  Bridges  and  Structures.  Mr.  James
serves as vice chair of the AASHTO Standing Committee on TRAC and is the com-
mittee’s newest member. Mr. James believes that top-down support of TRAC, or any
program is key to its success, and he plans to bring that message to the states with-
in his southeast U.S. AASHTO district.

Mr.  James  is  a  native  of  Canton,  Mississippi.  He  is  the  father  of  two  young  chil-
dren,  both  girls.  Together  with  his  wife,  who  is  also  an  engineer,  they  hope  to  in-
spire their children to careers in transportation.

Mr.  LIPINSKI.  Thank  you,  Mr.  James.  I  feel  right  at  home  here

with all the engineers on the panel. Dr. Womack?

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  KEVIN  C.  WOMACK,  DIRECTOR,  UTAH
TRANSPORTATION  CENTER;  PROFESSOR  OF  CIVIL  AND  EN-
VIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING, UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY
Dr.  WOMACK.  Thank  you.  I  am  here  as  the  Chair  of  the  Trans-
portation  Policy  Committee  of  the  American  Society  of  Civil  Engi-
neers,  but  I  am  also  a  structural  engineer  by  training  and  have
been  involved  in  the  area  of  bridge  research  for  the  past  15  years.
I  am  pleased  to  lend  ASCE’s  expertise  to  the  problem  of  the  Na-
tion’s crumbling infrastructure that was highlighted by the collapse
of the I–35 West bridge in Minneapolis.

Like  all  bridges,  all  man-made  structures  deteriorate.  Deferred
maintenance  allows  deterioration  and  causes  bridges  to  be  more
susceptible  to  failure.  As  with  other  critical  infrastructure,  a  sig-
nificant increase in investment is essential to maintain the benefits
and  to  assure  the  safety  that  society  demands.  Research  is  a  crit-
ical effort that can reduce the existing investment gap between the
funding available and the funding needed to improve the condition
and performance of our highway infrastructure.

The Highway Trust Fund has been an essential source of funding
for surface transportation research and technology and SAFETEA–
LU,  the  Surface  Transportation  Research,  Deployment  and  Devel-
opment  and  the  University  Transportation  Research  sections  were
both  completely  programmed  or  earmarked  and  over-authorized
creating  a  difficult  environment  within  which  FHWA  and  RITA
must allocate funds. An added result to this fact is that FHWA now
has  no  discretionary  funds  to  maintain  certain  core  research  pro-
grams,  which  means  that  its  Turner-Fairbank  Highway  Research
Laboratories  are  underutilized,  its  contract  research  program  is
limited,  and  such  critical  efforts  such  as  the  biennial  Conditions
and  Performance  Report  may  be  in  jeopardy.  The  practice  of  ex-
treme  programming  and  earmarking  of  the  research  title  needs  to
be eliminated in future transportation authorization bills.

When  looking  at  research  in  bridges,  the  current  university  and
FHWA research activities do look at materials and process. Newer,
more efficient designs can now be made due to computer analyses,
which have been researched extensively. Design methods, the new-
est  of  which  is  the  Load  and  Resistance  Factor  Design,  have  been
researched  and  must  continue  to  be  researched  to  determine  the
performance of these lighter structures that use materials more ef-
ficiently.

There is a need to study long-term bridge life to develop a better
understanding  of  how  bridges  age  and  deteriorate.  This  will  allow
us  to  better  predict  and  model  bridge  behavior  and  could  lead  to
improved  maintenance  practices  and  better  bridge  management.
The  FHWA’s  Long-Term  Bridge  Performance  Program,  a  planned
20-year research program, should lead the way in this effort.

Obviously, to maintain bridges, more funds are needed, and more
of those funds need to go into the maintenance of the structure, not
just  the  deck.  It  is  our  hope  that  the  Long-Term  Bridge  Perform-
ance  Program  will  help  to  provide  answers  as  to  how  to  properly
channel our nation’s bridge maintenance funds.

Once  a  bridge  is  safely  and  optimally  designed,  it  is  of  most  use
to the public if it can be built quickly and with the least disruption
to  traffic.  Accelerated  bridge  construction  can  help  to  accomplish

this  goal.  Prefabrication  of  bridge  elements  and  new  construction
techniques  are  being  championed  by  states  and  the  Federal  High-
way  Administration.  However,  performance  questions  remain,  par-
ticularly in the area of seismic performance of these types of struc-
tures. Research into these types of questions is essential.

In  terms  of  safety,  inspection  is  the  crux  of  this  issue.  A  more
clearly  defined  inspection  protocol  should  be  developed  through  re-
search  that  goes  beyond  visual  inspections  to  testing  and  moni-
toring that includes instrumentation. This new protocol must be as
objective as possible with no doubt as to what steps are to be taken
and  when.  One  way  to  make  visual  inspection  less  subjective  is  to
have  it  done  by  licensed,  professional  engineers  and  not  by  techni-
cians.  This,  however,  will  lead  to  an  exacerbation  of  the  workforce
issue and the current shortage of civil engineers, particularly in the
transportation area.

The objective of research is to develop beneficial new technologies
that will be better performing and more durable. Though the initial
cost of these new technologies may be higher, their efficiencies and
durability will, in the long run, reduce maintenance, repair, and re-
habilitation  costs  in  addition  to  creating  longer  service  lives.  This
is  how  research  can  assist  in  closing  the  current  investment  gap
that  is  so  well-defined  in  the  Conditions  and  Performance  Report.
The Federal Government should do more to encourage states to use
new  technologies  without  requiring  the  states  to  assume  all  the
risk.  There  is  an  FHWA  program,  the  Innovative  Bridge  Research
and  Deployment  Program,  that  is  designed  to  provide  money  to
states for the use of innovating materials or technologies. This pro-
gram  needs  to  be  expanded  and  monitored  to  ensure  that  these
funds actually go toward proving new technologies. However, at the
end  of  the  day,  procurement  and  procedures  must  be  changed  to
count  for  life  cycle  costs,  innovation,  and  contractor  qualifications,
or there will be no motivation to use new technologies. Successfully
and efficiently addressing the Nation’s infrastructure issue, bridges
and  highways  included,  will  require  long-term,  comprehensive,  na-
tionwide  strategy,  one  that  includes  research.  For  the  safety  and
security  of  our  families,  we  as  a  nation  can  no  longer  afford  to  ig-
nore  this  growing  program.  We  must  demand  leadership  from  our
elected  officials  because  without  action,  aging  infrastructure  rep-
resents  a  growing  threat  to  public  health,  safety,  and  welfare,  as
well as to the economic well-being of our nation.

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  concludes  my  statement.  I  will

be glad to answer any questions the Committee would have.

advisory committee to the Federal Highway Administration. I am a structural engi-
neer by training and have been involved in the area of bridge research for the past
15 years.

Thank  you  for  holding  this  hearing.  As  someone  who  has  worked  in  this  field  for
many years, I can say that there are few infrastructure issues of greater importance
to Americans today than bridge safety.

I  am  pleased  to  appear  today  to  lend  ASCE’s  expertise  to  the  problem  of  the  Na-
tion’s  crumbling  infrastructure  that  was  highlighted  by  the  tragic  events  of  August
1, 2007, when the I–35W Bridge in Minneapolis collapsed into the Mississippi River.
I. Bridge Conditions

More than four million vehicles cross bridges in the United States every day and,
like all man-made structures, bridges deteriorate. Deferred maintenance accelerates
deterioration,  which  may  make  bridges  more  susceptible  to  failure.  As  with  other
critical infrastructure, a significant investment is essential to maintain the benefits
and to assure the safety that society demands.

In  2005,  ASCE  issued  the  latest  in  a  series  of  assessments  of  the  Nation’s  infra-
structure. Our 2005 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure found that as of 2003,
27.1  percent  or  160,570  of  the  Nation’s  590,753  bridges  were  structurally  deficient
or functionally obsolete, an improvement from 28.5 percent in 2000. In fact, over the
past 12 years, the number of deficient bridges, both structurally deficient and func-
tionally  obsolete  categories,  has  steadily  declined  from  34.6  percent  in  1992  to  25.8
percent in 2006.

However,  this  improvement  is  contrasted  with  the  fact  that  one  in  three  urban
bridges (31.2 percent or 43,189) were classified as structurally deficient or function-
ally obsolete, much higher than the national average.

In  2005,  the  FHWA  estimated  that  it  would  cost  $9.4  billion  a  year  for  20  years
to eliminate all bridge deficiencies. In 2007, FHWA estimated that $65 billion could
be invested immediately in a cost beneficial manner to address existing bridge defi-
ciencies.

The 10-year improvement rate from 1994 to 2004 was a 5.8 percent (32.5 percent
- 26.7 percent) reduction in the number of deficient bridges. Projecting this rate for-
ward  from  2004  would  require  46  years  to  remove  all  deficient  bridges.  Unfortu-
nately,  bridges  are  now  deteriorating  at  a  rate  faster  than  we  can  maintain  them,
so  this  46  year  projection  has  grown  to  57  years  to  eliminate  all  deficient  bridges.
This  shows  that  progress  has  been  made  in  the  past  in  removing  deficient  bridges,
but our progress is now slipping or leveling off.

There is clearly a demonstrated need to invest additional resources in our nation’s
bridges. However, deficient bridges are not the sole problem with our nation’s infra-
structure.  The  U.S.  has  significant  infrastructure  needs  throughout  the  transpor-
tation  sector  including  roads,  public  transportation,  airports,  ports,  and  waterways.
As a nation, we must begin to address the larger issues surrounding our infrastruc-
ture so that public safety and the economy will not suffer.
II. Bridge Inspection Program

The National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS), in place since the early 1970s,
require biennial safety inspections for bridges in excess of 20 feet in total length lo-
cated on public roads. These inspections are to be performed by qualified inspectors.
Structures  with  advanced  deterioration  or  other  conditions  warranting  closer  moni-
toring are to be inspected more frequently. Certain types of structures in very good
condition may receive an exemption from the two-year inspection cycle. These struc-
tures may be inspected once every four years. Qualification for this extended inspec-
tion  cycle  is  reevaluated  depending  on  the  conditions  of  the  bridge.  Approximately
83  percent  of  bridges  are  inspected  once  every  two  years,  12  percent  are  inspected
annually, and five percent are inspected on a four-year cycle.

Information is collected documenting the conditions and composition of the struc-
tures. Baseline composition information is collected describing the functional charac-
teristics,  descriptions  and  location  information,  geometric  data,  ownership  and
maintenance responsibilities, and other information. This information permits char-
acterization  of  the  system  of  bridges  on  a  national  level  and  permits  classification
of the bridges. Safety, the primary purpose of the program, is ensured through peri-
odic hands-on inspections and ratings of the primary components of the bridge, such
as  the  deck,  superstructure,  and  substructure.  This  classification  and  condition  in-
formation  is  warehoused  in  the  National  Bridge  Inventory  (NBI)  database  main-
tained by FHWA. This database represents the most comprehensive source of infor-
mation on bridges throughout the United States.

It  is  important  to  note,  however,  that  the  value  of  the  NBI  is  limited,  although
it  is  certainly  a  useful  tool  to  evaluate  the  condition  of  public  bridges.  Among  its

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:07 Jan 20, 2008 Jkt 037641 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL07\091907\37641 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

41

limitations,  a  user  cannot  tell  the  condition  of  a  specific  element  of  the  bridge,  i.e.,
a  girder  or  diaphragm  or  bearing.  The  overall  rating  encompasses  the  super-
structure,  the  substructure,  and  the  deck  which  all  have  unique  elements.  There-
fore, the NBI cannot offer the kind of information that may be required for in-depth
analysis.

Two  documents,  the  American  Association  of  State  Highway  and  Transportation
Officials’  (AASHTO)  Manual  for  Condition  Evaluation  of  Bridges  and  the  FHWA’s
Recording  and  Coding  Guide  for  the  Structure  Inventory  and  Appraisal  of  the  Na-
tion’s Bridges, provide guidelines for rating and documenting the condition and gen-
eral attributes of bridges and define the scope of bridge inspections. Standard condi-
tion evaluations are documented for individual bridge components as well as ratings
for  the  functional  aspects  of  the  bridge.  These  ratings  are  weighted  and  combined
into an overall Sufficiency Rating for the bridge on a 0–100 scale. These ratings can
be  used  to  make  general  observations  on  the  condition  of  a  bridge  or  an  inventory
of bridges.

The  factors  considered  in  determining  a  sufficiency  rating  are:  S1—Structural
Adequacy and Safety (55 percent maximum), S2—Serviceability and Functional Ob-
solescence (30 percent maximum), S3—Essentiality for Public Use (15 percent max-
imum), and S4—Special Reductions (detour length, traffic safety features, and struc-
ture type—13 percent maximum).

In  addition  to  the  sufficiency  rating,  these  documents  provide  the  following  cri-
teria to define a bridge as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete, which trig-
gers  the  need  for  remedial  action.  The  structural  capacity  of  a  bridge  is  also  deter-
mined  and  is  used  to  decide  if  a  bridge  should  be  restricted  to  trucks  of  lower
weights.
Structurally  Deficient—A  structurally  deficient  bridge  may  be  restricted  to  light
vehicles because of its deteriorated structural components. While not necessarily un-
safe,  these  bridges  usually  have  limits  for  speed  and  weight,  and  are  approaching
the  condition  where  replacement  or  rehabilitation  will  be  necessary.  A  bridge  is
structurally  deficient  if  its  deck,  superstructure,  or  substructure  is  rated  less  than
or equal to 4 (poor) or if the overall structure evaluation for load capacity or water-
way  adequacy  is  less  than  or  equal  to  2  (critical).  This  is  on  a  condition  scale  with
ratings between 9 (excellent) and 0 (representing a failed condition). In a worse case
scenario, a structurally deficient bridge may be closed to all traffic.
Functionally Obsolete—A bridge that is functionally obsolete is safe to carry traf-
fic  but  has  less  than  the  desirable  geometric  conditions  required  by  current  stand-
ards.  A  bridge  is  functionally  obsolete  if  the  deck  geometry,  under-clearances,  ap-
proach roadway alignment, overall structural evaluation for load capacity, or water-
way  adequacy  is  rated  less  than  or  equal  to  3  (serious).  A  functionally  obsolete
bridge has older design features and may not safely accommodate current traffic vol-
umes  and  vehicle  sizes.  These  restrictions  not  only  contribute  to  traffic  congestion,
but  also  pose  such  major  inconveniences  as  lengthy  detours  for  school  buses  or
emergency vehicles.
Structural Capacity—Components of bridges are structurally load-rated at inven-
tory  and  operating  levels  of  capacity.  The  inventory  rating  level  generally  cor-
responds to the design level loads but reflects the present bridge and material condi-
tions with regard to deterioration and loss of section. Load ratings based on the in-
ventory  level  allow  comparisons  with  the  capacities  for  new  structures.  The  inven-
tory level results in a live load which can safely utilize an existing structure for an
indefinite  period  of  time.  The  operating  rating  level  generally  describes  the  max-
imum  permissible  live  load  to  which  the  bridge  may  be  subjected.  This  is  intended
to tie into permits for infrequent passage of overweight vehicles. Allowing unlimited
numbers  of  vehicles  to  use  a  bridge  at  the  operating  level  may  shorten  the  life  of
the bridge.

Bridge Engineers and Bridge Inspectors:

Bridge inspection services should not be considered a commodity. Currently, NBIS
regulations do not require bridge inspectors to be Professional Engineers, but do re-
quire  individuals  responsible  for  load  rating  the  bridges  to  be  Professional  Engi-
neers.  ASCE  believes  that  non-licensed  bridge  inspectors  and  technicians  may  be
used  for  routine  inspection  procedures  and  records,  but  the  pre-inspection  evalua-
tion,  the  actual  inspection,  ratings,  and  condition  evaluations  should  be  performed
by  licensed  Professional  Engineers  experienced  in  bridge  design  and  inspection.
They  should  know  the  load  paths,  critical  members,  fatigue  prone  details,  and  past
potential  areas  of  distress  in  the  particular  type  of  structure  being  inspected.  They
must  evaluate  not  only  the  condition  of  individual  bridge  components,  but  how  the

42

components fit into and affect the load paths of the entire structure. The bridge en-
gineer may have to make immediate decisions to close a lane, close an entire bridge,
or take trucks off a bridge to protect the public safety.

A  new  inspection  protocol  must  be  developed.  This  will  involve  visual  inspection,
load  testing,  and  monitoring  through  instrumentation  of  bridges.  The  new  protocol
must  be  as  objective  as  possible,  with  no  doubt  as  to  what  steps  are  to  be  taken
and  when.  One  way  to  make  the  visual  inspection  less  subjective  is  to  have  them
all  done  by  licensed  professional  engineers  and  not  by  technicians.  This,  however,
will lead to an exacerbation of the workforce issue and the current shortage of civil
engineers,  particularly  in  the  transportation  arena,  that  is  only  going  to  get  worse.

III. Bridge Design and Research

The  Highway  Trust  Fund  has  been  an  essential  source  of  funding  for  surface
transportation research and technology (R&T) for decades. Research results have led
to  many  benefits  including:  materials  that  improve  the  performance  and  durability
of pavements and structures; design methods that reduce scour (and the consequent
threat  of  collapse)  of  bridges;  intelligent  transportation  systems  technologies  that
improve  safety  and  reduce  travel  delay;  methods  and  materials  that  radically  im-
prove  our  ability  to  keep  roads  safely  open  in  severe  winter  weather;  innovative
management  approaches  that  save  time  and  money;  and  analytical  and  design  ap-
proaches  that  reduce  environmental  impacts,  support  sustainable  development  and
improve the aesthetic and cultural aspects of transportation facilities.

These  benefits  are  provided  through  several  major  transportation  research  pro-
grams.  In  the  highway  area  these  programs  include  the  FHWA  program,  the  Na-
tional  Cooperative  Highway  Research  Program  (NCHRP),  and  State  department  of
transportation programs largely funded through State Planning and Research (SPR)
funds. In the transit area the main programs are that of the Federal Transit Admin-
istration (FTA) and the Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP). The Univer-
sity  Transportation  Centers  (UTC)  program  supports  various  transportation  modes.
In SAFETEA–LU, the Surface Transportation Research, Deployment and Develop-
ment  and  the  University  Transportation  Research  sections  were  both  completely
programmed  or  earmarked  and  over-authorized,  creating  a  difficult  environment
within  which  FHWA  and  the  Research  and  Innovative  Technology  Administration
(RITA) must allocate funds. An added result to this practice is that FHWA now has
no  discretionary  funds  to  maintain  certain  core  research  programs,  which  means
that  its  Turner-Fairbank  Highway  Research  Center  laboratories  are  underutilized.
The  Research  Center’s  contract  research  program  is  limited,  as  is  its  provision  of
expert technical support for states when they encounter bridge and tunnel problems.
States  are  now  made  to  prove  they  can  pay  for  any  FHWA  technical  support.  Fi-
nally,  such  critical  efforts  as  the  biennial  Conditions  and  Performance  Report  may
be  in  jeopardy.  The  practice  of  extreme  programming  and  earmarking  of  the  re-
search  title  needs  to  be  eliminated  in  future  surface  transportation  authorization
bills.  Competition  and  selection  on  qualifications,  not  special  interest  group  influ-
ence is essential for an effective research program. And the FHWA must be left with
sufficient discretionary funds to maintain certain core programs.

When  looking  at  research  on  bridges,  the  current  university  and  FHWA  research
agenda  does  look  at  materials  and  process.  While  materials  and  process  are  areas
for  improvement,  the  design  of  bridges  is  a  well-developed  discipline.  In  fact,  one
reason  the  bridges  in  this  country  have  lasted  so  long  is  that  those  30-,  40-,  and
50-year-old,  or  even  older  bridges  were  typically  designed  very  conservatively  with
appropriate redundancy. Newer more efficient designs can now be made due to com-
puter  analyses  (finite  elements),  improved  materials,  and  construction  advances,
which have been researched extensively. Design methods, the newest of which is the
Load  and  Resistance  Factor  Design  (LRFD)  have  been  researched  and  must  con-
tinue to be researched to determine the performance of these lighter structures that
use materials more efficiently.

Better performing concretes can be made with increased durability and, if needed,
increased  strength.  Evaluation  of  this  concrete  with  new,  high  strength  reinforcing
bars  is  needed,  as  well  as  research  into  the  engineering  properties  and  feasibility
of using lightweight high performance concrete for bridges.

Research  is  ongoing  at  NCHRP  to  evaluate  the  remaining  fatigue  life  of  existing
older  steel  bridges  in  America.  This  is  an  important  study.  However  we  also  need
to continue the research, development, and deployment of high performance steel for
bridges, with its increased toughness and improved weldability.

Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites continue to hold promise for the future
for  bridges.  Research  to  develop  guidelines  for  using  FRP  in  bridge  decks,  as  well
as  using  FRP  externally-bonded  sheets  as  a  strengthening  repair  system  for  con-
crete girders and piers, is important.

Bridge  and  tunnel  security  is  an  area  that  demands  our  attention.  Research  into
blast resistant design for bridges and tunnels and development of specifications and
training materials for bridge engineers is important to our nation’s security.

Hurricane Katrina is most known to engineers for the damage that it did to New
Orleans  and  the  levees.  What  isn’t  as  well  known  is  the  damage  that  it  did  to
bridges  in  Louisiana,  Mississippi,  and  Alabama  due  to  wave  action,  storm  surge,
and  debris.  Research  being  done  through  a  joint  AASHTO–FHWA–TRB  transpor-
tation  pooled-fund  study  to  develop  Guide  Specification  and  a  Handbook  of  Retrofit
Options for Bridges Vulnerable to Coastal Storms is critical work for the safety and
operability of our nation’s bridges during extreme events.

There  is  also  a  need  to  study  long-term  bridge  life  to  develop  a  better  under-
standing of how bridges age and deteriorate. This will allow us to better predict and
model bridge behavior and could lead to improved maintenance practices and better
bridge  management.  The  FHWA’s  Long-Term  Bridge  Performance  Program,  a
planned  20-year  research  program,  should  lead  the  way  in  this  effort.  At  present,
this program is significantly under-funded.

As for maintenance, it is based on the funding available and which bridge is most
in  need  of  repair.  That  usually  means  deck  repair,  not  the  structure  of  the  bridge.
When the public notices problems, such as potholes and the like, these get attention.
The  public  rarely  notices  severe  structural  problems  unless  concrete  is  falling  from
the bottom of an overpass bridge.

Obviously,  to  properly  maintain  bridges,  more  funds  are  needed,  and  more  of
those  funds  need  to  go  into  the  maintenance  of  the  structure,  not  just  the  deck.  It
is  our  hope  that  the  Long-Term  Bridge  Performance  Program  will  help  to  provide
answers as to how to properly channel our nation’s bridge maintenance funds.

Once  the  bridge  is  safely  and  optimally  designed,  it  is  of  most  use  to  the  public
if it can be built quickly and with the least disruption to traffic. Accelerated bridge
construction can help to accomplish this goal. Prefabrication of bridge elements and
new construction techniques are being championed by states and the Federal High-
way  Administration.  However,  some  questions  remain  concerning  performance  in
earthquake regions. Research into these questions is needed.

In  short,  how  bridges  are  designed,  withstand  extreme  events,  age,  and  how  con-
struction  techniques  and  materials  for  bridges  can  improve  should  continue  to  be
researched to look for more efficient practices.

In terms of safety, inspection is the crux of this issue. I firmly believe that a more
rigorous  inspection  and  testing  protocol  should  be  developed  and  this  should  be  a
significant  research  topic.  This  is  where  an  issue  arises  with  the  I–35W  bridge.  It
was  inspected  appropriately,  issues  were  discovered,  and  then  there  were  no  strict
guidelines as to what to do next. It was decided to more closely monitor and inspect
the  bridge,  but  that  was  all  done  visually.  If  a  better  defined  protocol  were  devel-
oped, the next step should have been instrumentation that could have been perma-
nently  placed  on  the  bridge  to  monitor  its  condition  constantly.  The  chances  that
instrumentation would have picked up something critical in Minneapolis would have
been much greater than further visual inspections alone. Whether or not this would
have  picked  up  the  impending  failure  is  something  we  cannot  know,  but  chances
would have definitely been better.

A more clearly defined inspection protocol should be developed, through research,
which goes beyond visual inspections to include testing and monitoring with instru-
mentation.

Few  states  or  their  bridge  contractors  take  advantage  of  new  technologies  due  to
the  current  practice  of  selecting  low-cost  bids.  There  usually  is  no  incentive  for  the
contractors  to  use  new  technology;  it  is  often  more  expensive  and  may  have  in-
creased risk. Until life cycle costs, along with the consideration of innovative mate-
rials  or  construction  practices,  are  considered  in  awarding  bids,  then  nothing  is
going to happen. States are very wary of using new materials and technologies, be-
cause if the technology does not work, the state becomes legally liable.

The Federal Government should do more to allow states to use new technologies,
without  requiring  the  states  to  assume  all  the  risk.  There  is  an  FHWA  program—
the  Innovative  Bridge  Research  and  Deployment  program,  with  a  funding  level  of
$13.1  million  available—that  is  designed  to  provide  money  to  states  for  the  use  of
innovative  material  or  technologies.  However,  I  do  not  believe  the  funds  are  being
used  by  all  the  states  in  a  manner  that  would  result  in  proof  of  new  technologies.
Again,  until  procurement  procedures  are  changed  to  account  for  life  cycle  costs,
innovation,  and  contractor  qualifications,  there  is  little  motivation  or  financial  in-
centive to be innovative.

IV. Addressing the Current Bridge Deficiencies

We need to adopt a risk-management approach to determine our priorities for the
maintenance,  rehabilitation  and  replacement  of  bridges.  We  must  define  the  great-
est  risk,  looking  at  the  likelihood  of  bridge  failure  and  the  cost  in  lives  and  money
of such a failure. We must then determine where the funds should go to ensure the
greatest  return  in  terms  of  public  safety.  This  means  that  the  bridges  in  the  worst
shape do not necessarily get the money for repairs if they have a low potential loss
of  life  and  economic  impact.  With  limited  funds,  this  is  the  most  fiscally  most  re-
sponsible way to go.

The short-term consequences are what we have seen occur-periodic bridge failures
that  result  in  loss  of  life  and  economic  loss.  The  long-term  consequences  of  doing
nothing  more  than  we  do  now  will  be  potentially  disastrous.  As  the  classic  bridges
(unique  designs  that  span  major  rivers)  become  older  and  the  Interstate  bridges
reach  the  end  of  their  design  life,  bridge  collapses  may  become  more  frequent  with
time,  as  will  the  resulting  loss  of  life,  and  the  economic  consequences  of  tying  up
the country’s major shipping lanes.

V. ASCE’s Policies Regarding Bridges

In  1988,  the  National  Council  on  Public  Works  Improvement  estimated  that  a
doubling  of  the  annual  expenditure  on  infrastructure  is  needed  to  meet  national
needs.  Doubling  of  spending,  even  through  the  use  of  innovative  financing  tech-
niques,  is  unlikely.  To  increase  productivity  and  reduce  costs  through  the  develop-
ment  of  innovative  design,  materials,  construction  methodologies,  rehabilitation
technologies, maintenance procedures, and operation techniques are essential, to re-
ducing  the  correct  investment  gap  that  exists  in  caring  for  our  surface  transpor-
tation infrastructure.

Currently, there are a number of obstacles which discourage innovation on a wide-
spread  scale.  Civil  engineers,  for  example,  are  under  increasing  pressure  to  eschew
innovation and to be conservative in their judgment because of lawsuits, rules, regu-
lations, legislation, standards, budget expectations and restrictions, and a desire for
financial predictability.

Fragmentation of the design and construction industry limits the support of long-
term research efforts that could result in technological gains and innovation. Appro-
priate  technical  innovation  and  support  groups  can  contribute  to  improved  disaster
resilience,  cost  effectiveness  and  improved  productivity  and  quality  throughout  the
infrastructure industry.

The  public  demands  that  the  operation,  maintenance,  expansion,  rehabilitation
and  new  construction  of  the  Nation’s  infrastructure  be  performed  to  enhance  eco-
nomic  vitality,  disaster  resilience  and  public  safety,  but  with  minimal  impact  on
their  lives.  The  public  requirement  calls  for  innovative  solutions  to  minimize  costs
of delays, environmental costs and project costs. Establishing these innovative solu-
tions requires coordination and sustained research and development.

INFRASTRUCTURE RESEARCH AND INNOVATION

ASCE  supports  efforts  to  foster  research  and  development  related  to  infrastruc-
ture  facilities.  The  goal  is  to  enhance  support  of  economic  vitality  while  assuring
public  safety  and  disaster  resilience  through  increased  innovation,  productivity  and
security  in  design,  materials,  construction,  rehabilitation,  maintenance  and  oper-
ations as applied to America’s infrastructure facilities.

ASCE believes appropriate methods to implement infrastructure research, innova-

tion and security include:

nology and processes;

• Supporting  legislation  and  policies  that  encourage  development  of  new  tech-
• Supporting  and  encouraging,  through  appropriate  incentives,  research  to  ac-
celerate  the  development  of  existing  technology  and  develop  new  technology
in  the  fields  of  design,  materials,  construction,  maintenance,  rehabilitation,
and  operation  of  the  infrastructure  with  understanding  of  the  need  for  dis-
aster resilience;
• Supporting  appropriate  funding  for  infrastructure  research  at  the  federal
level  in  conjunction  with  State/local  agencies,  universities  and  private  enter-
prise;
• Supporting  efforts  to  identify  and  disseminate  information  on  Federal,  State,
and  local  governments,  academia  and  private  sector  infrastructure  research
and development activities;
• Supporting efforts to limit the risk and liability that would discourage innova-

tive infrastructure technology;

search and development activities; and

The Role of the Federal Government in Civil Engineering Research and Development
Federal  R&D  funding  currently  provides  a  substantial  percent  of  the  total  U.S.
civilian  R&D  investment.  Federal  leadership  is  essential  to  civil  engineering  re-
search.  With  inadequate  federal  funding,  the  ability  to  maximize  the  leveraging  of
R&D funds through government-university-industry partnerships would not be pos-
sible.

ASCE  supports  a  focused  federal  civil  engineering  research  and  development
(R&D)  program  consistent  with  national  goals.  Programs  should  promote  new  U.S.
capabilities, improve efficiencies and advance the practice of civil engineering to im-
prove the quality of life.

ASCE  encourages  coordinated  and  integrated  basic  and  applied  civil  engineering
research  that  leverages  federal  R&D  funds  through  government-university-industry
partnerships.  Programs  fostering  basic  research  should  focus  on  maintaining  a
steady flow of talent and technology to U.S. industry and agencies. Programs focus-
ing  on  higher  risk  research  with  the  potential  for  high  payoff  should  meet  national
needs and improve the quality of life by:

• Enhancing public health and safety;
• Enhancing environmental quality;
• Supporting the goals of sustainable development;
• Improving public works infrastructure;
• Improving global competitiveness in U.S. civil engineering products and proc-
• Enhancing national security.

esses; and

SURFACE TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH FUNDING

ASCE supports the following general principles in the reauthorization of research

and technology programs in the Nation’s surface transportation legislation:

• Improvements  resulting  from  research  and  technology  (R&T)  are  critical  to
achieving  national  transportation  goals  in  safety,  quality  of  life,  economic
health, environmental impacts, sustainability, and security.

• Adequate funding should be dedicated to R&T activities.
• Research  programs  should  be  conducted  according  to  the  highest  scientific
and  engineering  standards,  from  priority-setting  to  award  of  contracts  and
grants to review and evaluation of research results for implementation.
• Research  programs  should  be  carried  out  with  appropriate  involvement  from

roles for each partner and providing incentives for private investment.

Within the context of the general principles set out above, ASCE supports the fol-

lowing actions regarding specific surface transportation R&T programs.

• The  research  and  technology  portion  of  the  State  Planning  and  Research
(SPR)  program  should  be  maintained  to  help  support  state-specific  activities
while  continuing  to  encourage  the  states  to  pool  these  resources  to  address
matters of more general concern.
• University  research  should  continue  to  be  supported  through  the  University
Transportation  Centers  (UTC)  program  using  a  competitive  selection  process
that  guarantees  quality  participants  and  fairness  in  the  allocation  of  funds.
The  Federal  Highway  Administration’s  (FHWA)  program  should  be  strength-
ened  by  giving  it  sufficient  funding  and  flexibility  to  implement  the  rec-
ommendations  of  TRB  Special  Report  261,  The  Federal  Role  in  Highway  Re-
search  and  Technology:  to  focus  on  fundamental,  long-term  research;  to  per-

ers; to engage stakeholders more consistently in their program; and to employ
open competition, merit review, and systematic evaluation of outcomes.
• A  continuation  of  the  Strategic  Highway  Research  Program  SHRP  II  beyond
the life of SAFETEA–LU, ensuring that critical research will be continued in
key areas of surface transportation.
• The  Federal  Transit  Administration’s  (FTA)  research  program  should  be
given  sufficient  funding  and  flexibility  to  work  with  its  stakeholders  to  de-
velop and pursue national transit research priorities.
• The  new  Research  and  Innovative  Technology  Administration  (RITA)  should
have a well-defined scope and responsibility and appropriate funding, in addi-
tion to currently authorized research funding, so that it may supplement and
support the R&T programs of the modal administrations.

VI. Conclusion

Successfully  and  efficiently  addressing  the  Nation’s  infrastructure  issues,  bridges
and  highways  included,  will  require  a  long-term,  comprehensive  nationwide  strat-
egy—one that includes research and identifying potential financing methods and in-
vestment requirements. For the safety and security of our families, we, as a nation,
can  no  longer  afford  to  ignore  this  growing  problem.  We  must  demand  leadership
from  our  elected  officials,  because  without  action,  aging  infrastructure  represents  a
growing threat to public health, safety, and welfare, as well as to the economic well-
being of our nation.

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  That  concludes  my  statement.  I  would  be  pleased  to

answer any questions that you may have.

of the Science and Technology Committee, good morning.

Again, my name is Mark Bernhardt, and I am the Director of Fa-
cility  Inspection  for  Burgess  &  Niple  in  Columbus,  Ohio.  I  have

Burgess & Niple is also a member of ACEC, the American Coun-
cil  of  Engineering  Companies.  ACEC  is  the  business  association  of
America’s  engineering  industry  representing  over  5,500  member
firms  from  across  the  country.  On  behalf  of  ACEC  and  the  indus-
try, we appreciate the opportunity to testify before you today to dis-
cuss  the  research  and  technology  that  contributes  to  bridge  safety.
In  order  for  transportation  agencies  to  make  sound  decisions  re-
garding  bridge  maintenance  and  rehabilitation,  they  require  com-
prehensive  information  on  bridge  conditions.  Many  factors  control
the  validity  of  the  data  being  supplied  to  the  decision-makers.
These factors are as varied as inspector training and experience, ef-
fective  of  bridge  management  systems,  inspection  methods,  and
available funding. All of these factors play a role in ensuring bridge
safety.

Bridge  inspections  in  the  U.S.  are  generally  visual,  thus  quali-
tative  in  nature.  A  comprehensive  study  of  the  reliability  of  visual
inspection  was  performed  by  the  FHWA’s  Non-Destructive  Evalua-
tion  Center  in  2001.  This  study  suggested  that  visual-only  inspec-
tions  provide  data  that  is  often  highly  variable  and  influenced  by
many  factors  such  as  the  inspector’s  comfort  level  with  working  at
height,  structure  accessibility,  and  duration  of  inspection.  It  is  the
general  consensus  within  the  engineering  community  that  visual
inspection practices must be supported by rigorous training, certifi-
cation,  and  quality  assurance  programs  and  frequently  supple-
mented with testing techniques to ensure reliable results.

The  primary  non-destructive  evaluation  techniques  utilized  dur-
ing  the  inspection  of  steel  bridges  include  magnetic  particle,  dye
penetrant, and ultrasonics. These tests are relatively low cost, and
proven  protocols  have  been  developed  for  their  use  and  the  inter-
pretation  of  results.  For  concrete  bridge  decks,  very  simple  proce-
dures  such  as  dragging  a  chain  across  the  bridge  deck  can  be  a
very good indication of hidden deficiencies. Its modern counterpart,
ground  penetrating  radar,  can  do  the  same  thing  only  more  objec-
tively  and  with  repeatability.  The  Bridge  Inspector’s  Reference
Manual  which  forms  the  basis  of  bridge  inspector  training  pro-
grams  nationwide  details  these  test  methods  as  well  as  dozens  of
other effective methods.

What  these  tests  and  visual  inspection  all  have  in  common  is
that they record conditions only at a single point in time. They are
a  mere  snapshot  of  bridge  conditions.  While  this  is  generally  ade-
quate  for  relatively  low-risk  structures,  structurally  deficient  or
complex  structures  that  pose  a  greater  risk  to  the  traveling  public
require  more.  The  emerging  field  of  structure  health  monitoring
holds  much  promise  for  real-time  evaluation  of  structures  and  ob-
jective evaluation of bridge conditions. Structure health monitoring
involves  the  installation  of  sensors  under  bridge  components  that
allow  for  remote  collection  and  observation  of  data  at  any  time.
These can include strain gauges, weigh-in motion systems, fiber op-
tics,  cameras,  corrosion  sensors,  and  acoustic  emission  equipment,
all tied to data servers and digitally accessible in real time.

Funding  for  research  and  pilot  projects  in  this  area  should  con-
tinue  to  be  a  priority.  Bridge  engineers  can  be  most  effective  by
providing  the  decision-makers  in  transportation  agencies  with  ob-
jective,  data-driven  recommendations.  This  data,  combined  with

48

operational  risk-based  factors,  can  be  used  to  determine  optimum
prioritization of bridge repairs.

Underlying all of this, however, is the fact that simply collecting
more  data  and  providing  more  frequent  inspections  will  not  im-
prove  overall  bridge  safety.  Additional  funding  for  bridge  repair
and  replacement  is  required  to  adequately  keep  pace  with  bridge
program needs.

Professional  engineers  benefit  greatly  from  the  results  of  re-
search  and  technology  programs  funded  by  the  Federal  Govern-
ment.  The  traveling  public  is  the  greatest  beneficiary,  however.
Lessons  learned  and  the  conclusions  reached  during  NCHRP  and
FHWA  research  projects  are  effectively  disseminated  to  practicing
bridge engineers. They are immediately incorporated into improved
design, evaluation, and analysis methods.

In  the  weeks  following  the  Minnesota  I–35  bridge  collapse,  Bur-
gess & Niple was asked by a number of State transportation agen-
cies  to  assist  with  the  inspection  of  steel  deck  truss  bridges.  This
work  was  performed  in  response  to  an  FHWA  Technical  Advisory.
In  general,  the  inspections  were  carried  out  in  the  same  manner
as those completed prior to the I–35 collapse. Investigation into the
I–35 bridge collapse is still ongoing. It will likely be some time be-
fore  the  investigating  engineers  reach  a  definitive  conclusion  as  to
the  precise  cause  of  the  collapse.  Even  if  the  cause  of  the  collapse
is  found  to  be  unrelated  to  bridge  inspection  practices,  it  is  my
hope  that  the  dialog  that  has  resulted  from  this  tragic  event  will
lead to improvements in the field of bridge inspection and result in
a  safer  infrastructure  system.  A  better  understanding  of  bridge
conditions  through  the  expanded  use  of  testing  and  structure
health monitoring can help to improve both the allocation of bridge
repair funds and bridge safety.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I am happy to answer any ques-

tions you or the Committee Members may have.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MARK E. BERNHARDT

Mr.  Chairman,  honorable  Members  of  the  Science  and  Technology  Committee,

good morning.

My name is Mark Bernhardt and I am the Director of Facility Inspection for Bur-
gess & Niple, Inc. in Columbus, Ohio. I have been working in the bridge inspection
field  for  over  10  years  and  in  that  time  I  have  managed,  reviewed,  or  performed
more than 3,000 bridge inspections and 160 load ratings.

Burgess & Niple is also a member of ACEC, the American Council of Engineering
Companies, the business association of America’s engineering industry representing
over  5,500  member  firms  across  the  country.  On  behalf  of  ACEC  and  the  industry,
we appreciate the opportunity to testify before you today to discuss the research and
technology that contributes to bridge safety.

Bridge  deterioration  is  a  significant  problem  facing  transportation  agencies  na-
tionwide.  This  is  evidenced  by  the  more  than  73,000  structurally  deficient  bridges
currently  listed  in  the  National  Bridge  Inventory  (NBI).  In  order  for  federal,  State,
and local agencies to make sound decisions regarding bridge maintenance, rehabili-
tation,  and  replacement  programs,  they  require  comprehensive  information  on
bridge conditions. Many factors control the validity of the data being supplied to the
decision-makers in transportation agencies. These factors are as varied as inspector
training  and  experience;  effectiveness  of  bridge  management  systems;  inspection
methods;  and  available  funding.  All  of  these  factors  play  a  role  in  ensuring  bridge
safety.  In  today’s  testimony,  I  will  focus  my  comments  on  just  one  of  these  areas—
inspection  methods.  Specifically,  I  will  outline  some  common  techniques  and  tech-
nologies  employed  during  bridge  inspection  operations,  the  emerging  field  of  Struc-
ture Health Monitoring, and the effectiveness of technology transfer programs.

BRIDGE INSPECTION TECHNIQUES

49

Bridge inspections in the U.S. are generally visual, thus qualitative in nature, and
follow  the  requirements  outlined  in  the  National  Bridge  Inspection  Standards.
Bridge  inspections  are  performed  to  determine  if  any  immediate  hazards  exist  that
would  warrant  reducing  allowable  loads  on  a  structure  or  closing  it  entirely;  to  as-
certain  the  extent  of  deficiencies  or  structural  damage  resulting  from  deterioration
or other causes; and to enable bridge maintenance, repair, or replacement to be pro-
grammed effectively through early detection of deficiencies.

The  primary  tool  employed  by  bridge  inspectors  today  is  the  eyes.  A  comprehen-
sive study of the reliability of visual inspection was performed by the FHWA’s Non-
Destructive  Evaluation  Center  in  2001.  This  study  suggested  that  visual-only  in-
spections  provide  data  that  is  often  highly  variable  and  influenced  by  many  factors
such as the inspector’s comfort level with working at height, structure accessibility,
and duration of inspection. With regard to localized defects in superstructure mem-
bers,  the  study  found  that  less  than  8%  of  the  inspectors  successfully  located  weld
cracks and other implanted defects in test bridges. It is the general consensus with-
in the engineering community that visual inspection practices must be supported by
rigorous  training,  certification  and  quality  assurance  programs,  and  supplemented
with testing techniques to ensure reliable results.

Many common and proven non-destructive and destructive testing techniques are
available to the inspector to supplement visual observations and provide more useful
quantitative  data.  Additionally,  the  emerging  field  of  Structure  Health  Monitoring
holds  much  promise  for  real-time  evaluation  of  structures  and  objective  evaluation
of  bridge  conditions.  Providing  more  quantitative  data  to  bridge  program  managers
enables  them  to  more  effectively  allocate  bridge  rehabilitation  dollars.  One  current
challenge with these tests, however, is how to best integrate the results into existing
Bridge Management Systems.

The  primary  nondestructive  evaluation  techniques  utilized  during  the  inspection
of  steel  bridges  include  magnetic  particle,  dye  penetrant,  and  ultrasonics.  These
tests are relatively low cost, and proven protocols have been developed for their use
and the interpretation of results. For concrete bridge decks, very simple procedures
such as dragging a chain across a bridge deck can be a very good indication of hid-
den  deficiencies.  Its  modern  counterpart,  Ground  Penetrating  Radar,  can  do  the
same  thing,  only  much  more  objectively  and  with  repeatability.  Electrical  potential
can  be  measured  to  assess  corrosion  of  embedded  reinforcing  steel,  samples  of  con-
crete  can  be  extracted  for  laboratory  testing,  and  Impact  Echo  tests  can  be  used  to
locate  voids  in  post-tensioning  ducts.  The  Bridge  Inspector’s  Reference  Manual,
which  forms  the  basis  of  bridge  inspector  training  programs  nationwide,  details
these test methods as well as dozens of other effective methods.
LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT PRACTICES

What  these  tests  all  have  in  common,  as  well  as  the  federally  mandated  NBI  in-
spections,  is  that  they  are  often  used  to  record  conditions  only  at  a  single  point  in
time.  They  are  a  mere  a  snapshot  of  bridge  conditions.  While  this  is  generally  ade-
quate  for  relatively  low  risk  structures,  structurally  deficient  or  complex  structures
that  pose  a  greater  risk  to  the  traveling  public  require  more.  This  is  where  Struc-
ture  Health  Monitoring  holds  the  most  promise.  Structure  Health  Monitoring  in-
volves the installation of various sensors and monitors onto bridge components that
allow  for  remote  collection  and  observation  of  data  at  anytime.  These  can  include
strain  gages,  weigh-in-motion  systems,  fiber  optics,  cameras,  corrosion  sensors,  and
acoustic emission equipment, all tied to data servers and digitally accessible in real
time. While a number of successful structure monitoring programs have been imple-
mented,  the  technology  is  still  emerging.  Funding  for  research  and  ‘‘pilot  projects’’
in this area should continue to be a priority. Bridge engineers can be most effective
by  providing  the  decision-makers  in  transportation  agencies  with  objective,  data
driven  recommendations.  The  structural  condition  data,  combined  with  operational
‘‘risk-based’’  factors  such  as  traffic  counts,  can  be  used  to  determine  optimum
prioritization of bridge repairs.

Underlying  all  of  this,  however,  is  the  fact  that  simply  collecting  more  data  and
providing more frequent inspections will not improve overall bridge safety. The engi-
neering  and  scientific  community  can  help  to  improve  the  relevance  of  the  data  by
further  researching  advanced  testing  techniques.  Additional  funding  for  bridge  re-
pair  and  replacement  is  required  to  adequately  keep  pace  with  bridge  program
needs.
FHWA LONG-TERM BRIDGE PERFORMANCE PROGRAM

formance Program. This proposed 20-year program will provide the funding and op-

portunity  to  develop  standard  protocols  for  the  myriad  of  nondestructive  testing
methods, sensors, and monitoring systems available. The engineering community re-
quires  more  knowledge  in  the  areas  of  life  cycle  costs,  deterioration  models  and
mechanisms,  and  validation  of  the  effectiveness  of  repair  and  rehabilitation  strate-
gies  to  improve  the  practice  of  bridge  management.  Another  goal  of  this  long-term
program is to provide such data. I would encourage the Members of Congress to con-
tinue funding this essential program when its budget comes up for renewal.
FEDERAL TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Professional Engineers benefit greatly from the results of research and technology
programs  funded  by  the  Federal  Government.  The  traveling  public  is  the  greatest
beneficiary,  however.  Lessons  learned  and  conclusions  reached  during  NCHRP  and
FHWA research projects are effectively disseminated to practicing bridge engineers.
They  are  immediately  incorporated  into  improved  design,  evaluation  and  analysis
methods.

In  the  weeks  following  the  Minnesota  I–35  bridge  collapse,  Burgess  &  Niple  was
asked by a number of State transportation agencies to assist with the inspection of
steel  deck  truss  bridges.  This  work  was  performed  in  response  to  FHWA  Technical
Advisory 5140.27—Immediate Inspection of Deck Truss Bridges Containing Fracture
Critical Members. In general, the inspections were carried out in the same manner
as  those  completed  prior  to  the  I–35  collapse.  Some  additional  focus  was  placed  on
the  gusset  plate  connections  between  members  due  to  speculation  that  this  was  an
area of concern on the I–35 bridge.

The  investigation  into  the  I–35  bridge  collapse  is  still  ongoing.  It  will  likely  be
some time before the investigating engineers reach a definitive conclusion as to the
precise  cause  of  the  collapse.  Even  if  the  cause  of  the  collapse  is  found  to  be  unre-
lated to bridge inspection practices, it is my hope that the dialogue that has resulted
from this tragic event will lead to improvements in the field of bridge inspection and
result  in  a  safer  and  improved  infrastructure  system.  A  better  understanding  of
bridge conditions through expanded use of testing and Structure Health Monitoring
can help to improve both the allocation of bridge repair funds and bridge safety.

Thank  you  Mr.  Chairman  and  I  am  happy  to  answer  any  questions  you  or  the

Committee Members may have.

DISCUSSION

Mr.  WU.  [Presiding]  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Bernhardt.  The
witnesses and everyone in the room have been witness to what fre-
quently goes on here. The Chairman has had to step away to intro-
duce  his  bill  in  another  committee.  I  apologize  to  the  witnesses.  I
have  two  other  committee  hearings  going  on  right  now  and  had  to
step  away  quickly  to  cast  a  vote,  and  my  apologies,  but  I  hope  I
haven’t  missed  too  much  of  the  context  of  your  spoken  statements
and from your written statements. And at this point, we enter into
the  question  phase,  and  the  Chairman  recognizes  himself  for  five
minutes.

Mr.  Bernhardt,  you  talked  about  a  number  of  different  testing
methods,  and  some  of  the  other  witnesses  referred  to  them  also  in
their written testimony. Non-destructive testing has been common-
place  in  other  industries,  for  example,  in  aviation  for  quite  some
time.  And  Mr.  Judycki  and  Mr.  Tang,  your  research  center  has
worked  on  many  of  these  testing  methods,  and  yet  bridge  inspec-
tion continues to be primarily a visual process. Can you discuss for
us what some of the barriers to adoption are and not just in terms
of cost but also some of the non-cost barriers to adoption? And Mr.
Bernhardt, why don’t we begin with you, and then we will start at
the  other  end  of  the  table  for  anyone  else  who  has  some  input  on
this.

Mr.  BERNHARDT.  That  is  an  excellent  question.  I  think  some  of
the  primary  barriers  would  be  related  to  just  the  reluctance  to
change.  I  think  sometimes  within  human  nature  there  is  always  a
reluctance  to  change,  and  people  want  to  stick  with  what  they  are
comfortable  with  and  don’t  want  to  try  new  testing  methods  and
techniques; and I think that is part of it. Additionally, I think any
time  a  new  testing  technique  is  rolled  out  and  introduced,  there
has  to  be  an  infrastructure  behind  it  to  provide  the  training  and
the support to the personnel on the field that are going to use that
system.  If  it  is  a  computer-based  system,  certainly  there  has  to  be
the  infrastructure  there  to  keep  pace  over  the  years  as  the  com-
puter  system  gets  updated  or  the  technology  gets  updated.  So  it  is
not just buying a testing tool once, there has to be the commitment
from the agency to continue using that into the future and provide
the  training  and  resources  necessary  to  make  sure  the  personnel
are  using  it  properly  into  the  future,  too.  Many  times  an  agency
will get a new tool or testing technique. They will use it for a little
bit,  and  then  that  person  may  move  on,  that  is,  the  one  person  in
the  agency  that  knows  how  to  use  that;  and  that  knowledge  will
be  lost.  So  that  maybe  comes  into  play  a  little  bit  when  agencies
are making a decision on what technology to adopt and what equip-
ment to purchase.

Mr. WU. Mr. Judycki? Mr. Tang?
Mr.  JUDYCKI.  Let  me  just  pick  up  on  a  couple  of  points,  Mr.
Chairman.  First  of  all,  the  Federal  Highway  Bridge  Research  and
Technology  Program  is  about  a  $22  million  program  that  is  avail-
able,  and  part  of  that,  as  Dr.  Womack  mentioned,  it  is  all  des-
ignated,  in  fact  over-designated,  to  the  point  that  we  were  con-
cerned  about  the  flexibility,  or  the  lack  of  flexibility,  in  putting  a
program  together.  About  $900,000  is  available  to  us  and  is  being
used  effectively  in  our  non-destructive  evaluation  laboratory  and
for  non-destructive  work  on  new  inspection  technologies  and  tech-
niques. And we can talk about that some more. But on the barriers
to  innovation,  which  are  critically  important,  certainly  just  sheer
inertia,  is  to  new  technologies.  And  adopting  new  technology  is
very  important,  as  was  mentioned.  There  is  also  a  resource  issue,
and  certainly  new  technology  is  very  often  more  costly  without
clear evidence of long-term benefits; and that is obviously a barrier,
as well as the natural unwillingness to accept risk.

So I think that some of the solutions certainly relate to more ef-
fective communication as we look to deployment as well as possibly
providing  incentives,  and  providing  incentives  to  advancing  new
techniques, innovations, into the marketplace is something that we
think holds a great deal of potential.

Mr.  TANG.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  think  Federal  Highway
has  adopted  many  of  the  innovative,  non-destructive  evaluations.
Over  the  past  20  years,  we  have  supported  a  lot  of  research,  and
many  of  the  products  are  out  there  on  the  market  as  a  result  of
our research. And if you look at some of the non-destructive evalua-
tion,  we  have  different  phases  of  these  applications.  For  example,
when you go to visual inspection and you determine that you need
a  little  bit  more  in-depth  look  into  a  specific  detail,  then  we  will
bring in the non-destructive evaluation methods such as the ultra-
sonic  testing  or  the  acoustic  emission.  These  are  more  advanced

than  the  non-destructive  evaluation  that  we  have  used,  and  we
have  offered  in  our  training  program  to  include  techniques  so  that
we can train inspectors to use them.

Mr.  WU.  I  am  going  to  stretch  my  time  just  for  a  follow-up  with
Dr. Womack. Dr. Womack, you suggested that perhaps requiring li-
censed professional engineers would be a step forward in bridge in-
spection.  Would  that  help  also  the  inertia  problem  in  adoption  of
new technologies?

Dr. WOMACK. I believe it would help, but one of the reasons that
you  don’t  go  beyond  visual  inspection  is  a  human  resource  issue.
How many trained engineers do you have that can go out and per-
form these inspections? And so it becomes a resource issue in terms
of  trained  engineers,  and  the  number  of  trained  civil  engineers  is
becoming  less  and  less.  So  that  is  an  issue.  It  would  help,  but  it
is  part  of  the  problem.  I  think  kind  of  following  up  on  the  rest  of
the discussion, there is a convenience issue here as well. It is very
convenient  and  efficient  to  go  out  and  do  visual  inspections.  They
are  quick,  you  get  some  data,  you  can  put  that  into  the  database.
Non-destructive  evaluation  takes  more  time.  Usually  you  have  to
set  up  equipment.  Oftentimes  you  have  to  have  road  closures.  So
the  states  are  a  little  bit  wont  to  do  that  because  of  the  inconven-
ience of it. I think as a follow-up to visual inspections where there
are  issues,  certainly  NDE  must  be  used,  and  I  think  that  is  part
of this protocol that has to be defined.

Mr. WU. Thank you, Dr. Womack. And with that, Mr. Hall.
Mr.  HALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  You  know,  this  is  just  a
terrible problem of fear of people in the driving public. In our state,
we  have  a  State  engineer  and  we  have  254  county  engineers;  and
we  have  direct  access  to  them  to  ask  them  questions  about  it.  I
could  ask  Mr.  Bernhardt  whether  or  not  the  current  inspection
methods  are  sufficient.  I  would  like  for  him  to  state  yes.  I  doubt
seriously that he is going to, but you know, we even have—we have
all  kinds  of  fears.  We  even  have  the  fear  of  asteroids  coming  by,
and we did a study on asteroids about 15 years ago and found out
one  had  come  within  15  minutes  of  the  Earth  in  1988  and  nobody
knew  it  was  here  until  it  came  and  went  by.  And  it  is  the  size  of
one of the states up in the northeastern part of this country.

This is the thing that can really be fearful for people. Every time
anybody drives up on one of those high arching areas like we have
near  the  big  cities  basically.  I  think  it  strikes  some  fear  into  their
heart, what can happen. So I guess when I ask you, Dr. Bernhardt,
if  the  current  inspection  methods  are  sufficient  and  you  are  going
to  say  the  factors  have  a  lot  to  do  with  it,  I  guess  continuous  use
of it, the stress of it, the weight at the time that the tragedy occurs,
the deterioration of the past, the force of wind or rains or your typ-
ical  westward  wind  or  your  typical  eastern  wind  that  could  affect
a  particular  bridge  or  movement  of  the  underlying  earth,  it  is  so
many  things  that  play  into  that.  I  don’t  know  how  on  Earth  with
the number of bridges that we have that you can answer that with
any degree of finality, but you want to take a shot at it?

Mr.  BERNHARDT.  Yes,  sure.  Statistically  speaking,  with  600,000
bridges,  I  feel  safe  driving  over  a  bridge;  but  on  the  other  hand,
I  wouldn’t  be  surprised  if  I  read  in  the  paper  tomorrow  that  an-
other  bridge  fell  down.  So  certainly,  like  any  programs,  there  are

improvements that can be made both in the training of inspectors,
the implementation of the program, and then what we do with the
data on the back end.

I think one of the larger issues is that we don’t have the mecha-
nisms in place now from my perspective to address the deficiencies
the  inspectors  are  currently  finding.  So  I  mean  as  an  example,  if
we doubled our inspection frequency and inspected bridges twice as
often  and  produced  twice  as  many  inspection  reports  and  twice  as
many recommendations, the ones——

Mr. HALL. And take twice as much tax money.
Mr. BERNHARDT. Yeah, the recommendations we make now often
aren’t addressed because the funding is not available. So certainly,
on the repair side, there needs to be some changes there to get that
caught up with the needs that the inspectors are currently finding
now.  That  being  said,  I  think  there  are  certainly  improvements
that can be made in the bridge inspection process to make it more
uniform  throughout  the  United  States,  improve  the  certification  of
bridge  inspectors,  both  PE’s  and  non-PE’s  that  help  in  the  inspec-
tion  process.  A  good  example  is,  you  know,  in  the  current  NBIS
regulations, the program manager position and the team leader po-
sition  are  the  two  positions  that  are  required  to  have  the  80-hour
comprehensive  bridge  inspection  training.  The  rest  of  the  inspec-
tion team is not required to have that training. Certain states have
more  stringent  requirements  and  require  all  members  of  the  in-
spection team to have the inspection training, but according to the
federal  guidelines,  you  could  go  be  an  inspector  on  a  bridge  under
the  guidance  of  a  team  leader  who  has  had  the  class,  but  it  could
be  your  first  day  on  the  job,  and  you  could  be  inspecting  a  bridge
with  probably  little  or  no  knowledge  about  the  performance  of
structures.  Errors  like  that  can  be  addressed  in  the  National
Bridge  Inspection  Standard  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  inspec-
tions.

Mr.  HALL.  I  guess  asteroids  are  not  as  normal  as  Katrinas,  but
we don’t even know when they are coming. How about Dr. Womack
if  I  have  a  little  time  left.  In  your  testimony  you  said  new  inspec-
tion  protocol  ought  to  be  developed;  and  I  guess  that  is  what  Mr.
Bernhardt  is  talking  about.  Do  you  want  to  enlarge  on  that  any?
Dr.  WOMACK.  Currently  there  is  a  standard  for  the  frequency  of
visual inspections, but beyond that, there is really no defined proc-
ess.  As  Mr.  Bernhardt  said,  you  know,  you  can  develop  a  lot  of
data, but what does it mean and what do you do with it? So I think
we  need  to  define  a  protocol  where  if  the  visual  inspection  shows
up  issues,  that  there  ought  to  be  some  sort  of  follow-up  to  that
rather  than  just  more  frequent  visual  inspections.  Maybe  there
should be some defined non-destructive evaluation that needs to be
performed  or  something  else  to  be  done  that  is  a  little  more  objec-
tive than just more frequent visual inspections.

Mr.  HALL.  Was  that  standard  followed  leading  up  to  the  I–35

tragedy collapse in Minneapolis?

Dr.  WOMACK.  From  what  I  know  of  that  situation,  they  were  in-
specting  the  bridge  more  frequently  than  required.  They  had  some
options to do some things and they just chose to continue the more
frequent visual inspection. Now, that is not to say that if they had
done  something  different  such  as  putting  instrumentation  on  the

58

bridge  that  it  wouldn’t  have  collapsed  or  that  we  wouldn’t  have
known  about  it  anyway;  but  perhaps  with  instrumentation,  there
might have been some precursor information to some issues on the
bridge.  And  so  that  is  what  is  not  defined.  When  you  do  find  bad
things  with  a  bridge,  what  do  you  do  next;  and  that  is  not  at  all
a well-defined process.

Mr.  HALL.  I  may  have  to  do  it  by  mail  later,  but  I  would  like  to
kind  of  know  what  new  processes  are  in  place  and  whether  or  not
people  are  following  them  and  whether  or  not  they  are  making
records  of  the  fact  that  they  follow  them  and  that  we  can  rely  on
the fact that they are following them and they are effective.

Mr.  Chairman,  you  will  leave  open  the  opportunity  for  us  to
write and seek answers from them if we don’t get to follow-up ques-
tions, will you not?

Mr. WU. Yes, I will do that.
Mr. HALL. I yield back the time I don’t have.
Mr.  WU.  Questions  will  be  submitted  in  writing,  and  answers

will be returned in writing. Mr. Lipinski.

Mr. LIPINSKI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to follow-up. The
end  of  the  answer  to  the  last  question  there,  when  you  find  some-
thing  wrong,  what  do  you  do  next?  What  problems  are  we  facing
right  now?  Is  it  a  real  need  to  have  that  type  of  protocol?  It  cer-
tainly makes sense that it would make sense. Is our bigger problem
just  a  lack  of  taking  action  because  of  a  lack  of  funding  to  be  able
to  do  anything  when  we  do  find  that  there  is  a  problem?  So  is  it
right  now  largely  a  money  problem,  or  is  it  both  a  combination  of
a  money  problem  and  where  we  just  do  not  have  the  protocol  in
place  as  to  okay,  we  find  a  problem,  what  do  we  do  next  to  try  to
avoid a catastrophe? So who wants to start with that question? Dr.
Womack.

Dr.  WOMACK.  I  am  probably  not  the  best  person  to  answer  that
question.  I  would  guess  it  is  somebody  from  the  state  who  has  a
better feel on the available dollars would be better put. But I think
it is a lack of knowing what to do next, but I think it is maybe an
issue  in  terms  of  determining  how  the  available  monies  are  spent.
And  coming  from  that  point  of  view,  I  think  that  you  need  to  take
more of a risk assessment approach in terms of utilizing the funds.
Where  is  the  highest  risk,  and  inspections  non-destructive  evalua-
tion  can  help  you  determine  what  the  risk  is.  And  then  you  need
to side on a more risk-assessment analysis, where to spend the lim-
ited amount of funds.

Mr.  LIPINSKI.  I  will  go  to  Mr.  James  since  you  are  not  the  DOT.
Mr.  JAMES.  Yes,  sir.  If  you  will  think  of  a  bridge  very  much  like
a person, a bridge is born after many months and sometimes years
of  development,  thought  and  development.  They  are  born,  they
have a life expectancy when they are first put under traffic, 50, 75,
sometimes  even  100  years.  As  the  bridge  ages  due  to  just  the  nat-
ural deterioration, as we each do our own bodies: We go to a doctor;
we  have  a  physical.  We  look  at  things.  That  is  an  analogy  to  the
bridge  inspector  out  there.  He  looks,  he  finds  something.  If  it  is
something  that  can  be  arrested  to  stop  deterioration  or  to  even
keep  it  from  becoming  a  chronic  condition,  that  is  what  we  look  to
do to basically preserve what we have so that we can get the fullest
life  expectancy  of  what  we  have  out  there.  Many  times  funding,

59

though,  drives  those  decisions.  I  think  you  have  heard  the  term
worst  first?  Many  times  that  is  what  we  have  to  do  because  we
have no choice. That is not what we would like to do because many
times that is not the best of our resources that we have.

So each state is different. We have to look at it from our own per-
spective.  We  try  to  use  low-cost  construction,  maintenance-friendly
details when we design and build our bridges. Again, it is one thing
if  you  are  looking  at  an  aircraft  fuselage  in  a  hanger  using  non-
destructive testing and something else if you are out there 100 foot
in the air on the end of a bucket with a rope sling around you try-
ing  to  manhandle  some  non-destructive  equipment  to  figure  out
whether you have got a problem or not.

So,  the  inspector  develops  a  relationship  with  a  bridge.  He  goes
and  looks  at  it  many  times,  and  what  he  is  looking  for  is  change
to  see  what  the  difference  is  from  what  he  saw  the  last  time  he
looked at it.

Mr. LIPINSKI. Thank you. Mr. Judycki, did you want to add some-

thing?

I would.

Mr.  JUDYCKI.  Yes,  and  then  I  will  turn  it  over  to  Mr.  Tang.  I
asked  him  to  mention  fracture  critical  members  in  a  moment.  But
I  would  just  make  the  observation  that  there  are  some  process
issues  here,  and  I  think  that  one  of  the  things  that  Federal  High-
ways  has  very  much  as  part  of  our  culture,  is  to  make  improve-
ments  in  processes  and  procedures  as  the  need  comes  to  light.  We
did  this  after  the  2001  NDE  evaluation  of  inspection  techniques
that  really  resulted  very  directly  in  quality  control  and  quality  as-
surance and additional training being required as well as the oper-
ating  inspection  certification.  So,  I  think  that  the  ability  to  learn
from these experiences and build it into national processes and cer-
tification  standards  in  the  NBIS  program  becomes  very  important.
With that though, I think that if I could turn it over to Mr. Tang,

Mr. TANG. Mr. Lipinski, I think you mentioned about the finding.
If an inspector finds something wrong with the bridge, what do you
do?  In  our  National  Bridge  Inspection  Standards,  we  do  have  a
term called critical finding. Then every inspector when they attend
training, the first thing they are told to do is if they see an unsafe
bridge,  close  it.  That  is  the  immediate  action  that  they  have  to
take.  After  that,  they  would  have  to  bring  in  their  more  experi-
enced  people  to  determine  if  they  should  keep  the  bridge  open  for
traffic  or  should  they  repair  it  immediately.  So  in  terms  of  critical
finding, if there is such a critical finding on the bridge, they would
have to immediately repair it, fix it, or close the bridge. That is in
our regulations.

Mr. LIPINSKI. If the Chairman will let me just ask for a brief fol-
low-up. How often does it happen? How often are bridges closed be-
cause  it  is  a  very  difficult  thing  to  do,  to  close  a  bridge  because  of
inconvenience  in  some  locations?  How  often  is  that  done?  Do  you
think—how bad does a bridge have to be and how often is it done?
Mr.  TANG.  First  of  all,  even  during  inspection  time,  when  you
have  inspection  equipment  on  the  bridge,  there  may  not  be  room
for opening to traffic; so sometimes they do close part of the bridge
to even get the inspection gear into position to inspect it. Now, how
often,  this  is  the  question  that  we  don’t  have  the  answer  in  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:07 Jan 20, 2008 Jkt 037641 PO 00000 Frm 00063 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL07\091907\37641 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

60

sense  of  a  broad  answer  for  it.  It  is  left  up  to  the  inspectors.  They
are  trained  to  determine  that  when  they  need  to  close  a  bridge,
they will close the bridge.

Mr. LIPINSKI. Thank you very much.
Mr.  WU.  I  would  like  to  thank  the  gentleman.  The  gentleman

from Georgia, Dr. Gingrey.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Mr.  James,  I  enjoyed
your analogy, as you know I would as a physician member. I would
say that a follow-on to Mr. Tang’s remarks in regard to Mr. Lipin-
ski’s  question  about  if  you  find  something,  when  do  you  say,  you
know,  we  are  going  to  have  to  inconvenience  the  public.  We  are
going to have to shut this bridge down for long-term safety, maybe
a  short  time  shutting  it  down.  It  is  kind  of  like  the  individual  pa-
tient.  You  can  tell  them  that  they  need  to  do  something,  but  you
can’t  make  them  do  it.  But  I  think  people  at  the  state  level,  Mr.
James,  certainly  have  the  ability  to  say  you  are  going  to  be  incon-
venienced. I was in New York a couple of weekends ago, and I had
the opportunity to drive through the Lincoln Tunnel and then later
on across the Brooklyn Bridge, both aging structures; and after this
Minnesota  tragedy,  I  couldn’t  help  but  think  about  when  the  last
time they had been inspected.

But  my  comments  are  getting  to  a  question  that  I  am  going  to
address  to  Mr.  Bernhardt.  But  again,  Mr.  James,  your  analogy  to
the  human  being,  there  is  a  test  that  is  a  little  bit  more  than  an
X-ray  that  looks  for  calcium  in  and  around  the  heart.  And  I  have
a  good  friend  that  had  that  test  done,  and  the  doctor  said,  oh,  you
have got a tremendous amount of calcium showing up on this test.
Therefore you need to have an angiogram. You need to have a dye
study of your coronary arteries. It was completely normal. And that
test  is  expensive  and  not  without  some  risk.  So  what  I  am  saying
is, there are certain tests that show something, but it is not signifi-
cant, though that calcium was all outside of the arteries. It wasn’t
inside the arteries.

So  Mr.  Bernhardt,  the  question  is  do  you  think  that  visual  in-
spection, even though you are talking about professional engineers
and  highly  trained,  motivated  people,  can  get  the  job  done?  What
are  the  limitations  of  purely  doing  it  that  way,  and  do  we  need  to
move  quickly  toward  better  testing?  And  if  there  is  time,  Mr.
Chairman,  and  maybe  in  the  second  round  if  there  is  not  time,  I
want to go back to Dr. Womack’s comments and his opening state-
ment and also Mr. Judycki in regards to this issue of programming
or  earmarking  away  a  lot  of  funding  in  SAFETEA–LU  that  took
the ability out of your hands to use that money to do research pro-
grams. You know, I don’t want to get too political here. We all have
member  initiatives,  and  I  am  one  of  them.  I  got  these  great  pro-
grams  in  the  State  of  Georgia  that  I  want  to  see  funded,  but  I
think we need to talk about that, Mr. Bernhardt.

Mr.  BERNHARDT.  Yeah,  visual  inspection,  in  and  of  itself,  cer-
tainly isn’t going to give you enough information to gather the data
that  you  need  to  make  effective  decisions  about  bridge  rehabilita-
tion.  It  must  be  supplemented  with  testing,  both  non-destructive
and  destructive  testing;  and  in  some  cases  the  structural  health
monitoring  is  what  holds  so  much  promise  for  the  future,  too,  be-
cause  the  structural  health  monitoring  can  provide  a  continuous

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:07 Jan 20, 2008 Jkt 037641 PO 00000 Frm 00064 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL07\091907\37641 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

61

data stream, whereas if I go out and do NDE, non-destructive eval-
uation  on  a  bridge  today,  that  is  showing  me  what  the  conditions
are  like  today.  If  I  have  monitoring  equipment  installed  on  that
bridge  that  is  giving  me  continual  feedback,  it  can  even  be  set  up
to have alarms where it is monitoring the stresses in the members.
I  am  getting  more  of  a  continuous  feed  of  data.  So  certainly  that
is an advantage for that type of testing. Visual is only going to pro-
vide  you  with  so  much,  and  it  is  going  to  be  very  qualitative  data.
It  is  going  to  be  subjective.  I  am  going  to  rate  something  a  four,
somebody else is going to rate something a six; and I pass that in-
formation on to the decision-maker and policy-makers, and they are
like,  well,  what  does  this  mean?  I  got  two  different  answers  com-
ing. And that is because visual is very subjective. The more testing
and instrumentation we can do, that helps to make the whole proc-
ess much more objective. So that is a big benefit for that, too.

Additionally,  when  you  have  hard  data  being  supplied  to  you,
you  can  make  more  effective  decisions  about  which  bridges  do  I
need  to  direct  my  funding  towards.  You  may  have  a  condition  rat-
ing  on  an  element  that  says  that  this  bridge  is  in  poor  condition.
Well,  the  actual  stresses  in  the  member  may  be  okay.  So  by  doing
some instrumentation and further analysis, you may be able to de-
termine  that  the  bridge  doesn’t  actually  need  repairs,  and  that
money  can  be  directed  somewhere  else.  And  you  wouldn’t  be  able
to tell that through visual alone, but only through testing and anal-
ysis  and  modeling  would  you  get  the  answers  to  those  questions.
Mr.  GINGREY.  I  see  my  time  is  expired,  and  I  guess  the  second
part  of  that  question  I  will  save  to  the  second  round,  Mr.  Chair-
man.

Mr. LIPINSKI. I thank the gentleman. The gentlelady from Texas,

Ms. Johnson.

Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I guess that
my  question  could  be  directed  to  the  representatives.  In
SAFETEA–LU  there  were  a  number  of  bridges  designated  because
the  states  had  them  on  their  critical  list.  However,  I  don’t  know—
in Texas, I have over 50,000 bridges. And I–35, which had the col-
lapse  in  Minnesota,  is  one  of  those  bridges  designated.  And  I  did
earmark  the  money,  and  I  will  do  it  again;  and  I  am  never  going
to  stop  earmarking,  because  if  we  don’t,  my  areas  don’t  get  any-
thing.  And  so  I  just  want  to  know  that  when  you  decide  through
examination what bridges are in critical condition, how do you han-
dle it? Do you go to your Congress people or feud about it or what
happens?

Mr.  JAMES.  Ms.  Johnson,  we  work  within  the  resources  that  we
have.  If  we  find  a  bridge  with  critical  needs,  then  many  times  we
will direct the resources from one part of the program to that par-
ticular  area  so  that  we  can  make  a  rehabilitation  or  replacement
of  that  structure  so  that  that  problem  goes  away.  It  is  a  matter  of
prioritization  and  taking  into  account  many  factors  in  those  deci-
sion  as  to  which  bridges  receive  the  critical  treatment  first.  Of
course,  if  one  is  about  to  be  closed  or  hopefully  never  reaches  that
state,  then  obviously  many  more  resources  are  directed  toward  it
to keep things open. They take into account the impact on the gen-
eral public as well as the safety of the public as well.

Ms.  JOHNSON.  Well,  you  indicated  that  visual  decisions  after
bridges are inspected usually can be considered accurate. And what
other methods do you use to inspect the bridges?

Mr. BERNHARDT. I will take that one. Essentially, are you speak-

ing specifically to what type of testing techniques?

Ms. JOHNSON. Yes.
Mr. BERNHARDT. There is a number of tried and true ones which
are  commonly  used  by  many  state  DOTs,  magnetic  particle,
ultrasonics,  dye  penetrant  for  steel  bridges,  ground-penetrating
radar,  impact  echo.  Those  are  all  concrete  methods  that  work  on
concrete bridges. FHWA has a Bridge Inspector’s Training Manual,
and  it  details  more  than  a  dozen  common  testing  techniques;  and
the bridge inspection training that team leaders and program man-
agers  take  cover  all  these  techniques.  Additionally,  State  DOTs
have  seminars  where  they  train  their  people  on  how  to  use  those.
So those are kind of the tried and true methods.

And  then  there  is  a  whole  host  of  emerging  technologies.  Some
work out, some are just a flash in the pan. But those are the main
ones.

Ms.  JOHNSON.  Thank  you.  You  know,  the  states  had  rescissions
even  after  the  money  was  sent  out  the  last  time.  So  we  still  don’t
have  any  work  going  on  on  those  so-called  critical  bridges,  but
hopefully  it  will  begin  soon.  There  is  no  money  in  Washington,  as
you  know,  and  I  don’t  think  there  is  very  much  in  states  because
my  state  just  told  me  that  they  had  no  money  for  maintenance,
which is maintenance that was very important. And so, we have a
bipartisan committee out of our delegation. We are going to be get-
ting  together  to  see  how  we  handle  it.  So  if  you  don’t  get  any  fed-
eral dollars any time soon for this, how would you handle a critical
bridge?

Mr. JAMES. Again, we work with the resources we have. If there
are  needs  of  a  bridge,  we  will  direct  state  dollars  for  it  to  keep  it
from  being  closed  to  take  whatever  actions  are  necessary  for  it  to
remain  safe  and  open  to  the  public.  Again,  we  use  best  manage-
ment  practices,  we  use  details  from  our  design  and  construction
that are maintenance friendly, proven to be very cost-effective dur-
ing  the  construction  as  well  as  details  having  longevity  and  are
also  friendly  to  bridge  inspection.  So  you  do  whatever  is  appro-
priate  as  far  as  the  inspection  visual.  It  is  by  far,  you  know,  the
easiest  and  the  first  place  to  start;  and  the  more  complex  a  bridge
structure  becomes,  you  go  from  there  using  whatever  technologies
are available to you. And the same thing would be with the repair,
whatever  is  appropriate.  You  take  whatever  actions  are  necessary.
Very similar to Dr. Gingrey’s comments about the, you know, a pa-
tient.  Sometimes  you  look  and  you  find  something  and  it  is  there
but it is not a problem, so you just continue to monitor it.

Ms.  JOHNSON.  Unpredicted  weather  conditions  that  occurred,
have  you  known  any  bridges  that  might  have  checked  okay  and
then  after  that,  some  kind  of  catastrophe,  you  find  it  is  in  a  dif-
ferent  shape?  I  am  sorry.  I  hope  I  am  not  giving  a  confusing——
Mr.  JAMES.  No,  ma’am.  I  can’t  speak  for  every  state  what  each
state  has  found.  I  know  in  our  state  we  have  not  found  anything
that  is,  you  know,  weather  related.  Obviously  the  two  bridges  we
lost  from  Katrina  were  weather  related,  but  I  don’t  think  anybody

could  have  prevented  some  act  of  God  like  that.  As  far  as  some-
thing  that  we  look  at  one  year  and  then  come  back  a  year  later,
nothing that has led to any catastrophe or tragedy within our state
boundaries.

Mr.  BERNHARDT.  In  terms  of  weather  related  problems  with
bridges,  probably  the  greatest  one  is  what  is  known  as  scour.  Es-
sentially  when  you  have  a  bridge,  you  have  a  big  rainstorm  event,
the  stream  fills  up  with  water,  the  velocity  of  the  water  increases,
and  it  will  scour  out  around  the  foundations  for  the  bridge;  and
there have been bridge collapses that resulted from scour. So scour
is certainly one of those critical items that bridge inspectors pay at-
tention  to  and  monitor  stream  beds,  and  if  there  was  one  primary
weather related cause of bridge failures, it would have to be scour.

Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Mr.  WU.  Thank  the  gentlelady.  The  gentleman  from  Michigan,

Dr. Ehlers.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you  very  much.  My  mother  always  told  me

that scouring was good. It was a typical Dutch housewife.

When  I  went  off  to  college,  I  started  out  in  engineering,  and  I
went  astray  and  became  a  nuclear  physicist;  and  I  have  always
maintained  a  great  interest  in  engineering  and  I  have  a  huge
amount  of  respect  for  it.  I  was  with  Buckminster  Fuller  once  who
is  one  of  the  more  imaginative  engineers  in  the  history  of  the  pro-
fession.  He  commented  that  the  first  time  engineering  ever  really
had to develop as an engineering science was in the design of boats
because  you  had  to  design  the  boat  very  carefully  using  minimum
materials,  minimum  weight  to  carry  maximum  load,  whereas  be-
fore  in  building  buildings,  for  example,  you  just  kept  piling  the
bricks  on  until  you  were  safe  or  even  the  Roman  aqueducts  which
have  survived  for  2,000  years.  They  used  a  lot  more  bricks,  a  lot
more  material  than  they  really  needed  to  transport  that  small
amount of water. There wasn’t a lot of engineering then.

And  you  know,  Buckminster  is  right  in  a  number  of  ways.  We
have really advanced. We have learned to build buildings using the
minimum  amount  of  material,  minimum  amount  of  money,  how  to
accomplish  the  goal.  I  think  airplanes  are  the  epitome  of  success
and  design  in  trying  to  use  minimum  weight,  minimum  dollars  to
accomplish the task.

Bridges  are  another  good  example  of  that,  and  I  am  just  awed
by  what  engineers  have  done  in  bridge  design  construction;  but  I
am not sure that we have kept up as a society in our examination
and inspection of those. And my question is first of all, is it a lack
of  knowledge,  and  lack  of  technology?  Aren’t  we  putting  enough
into  research  for  non-destructive  testing  techniques  and  so  forth.
Or  is  it  another  case  where  we  are  simply  as  a  society  willing  to
pay  for  the  initial  structure,  whatever  it  may  be;  but  we  are  not
willing  to  pay  adequately  for  the  maintenance.  Can  you  give  me
any  comments  indicating  where  we  have  gone  wrong?  Is  it  a  lack
of  resources  or  is  it  a  lack  of  research  in  non-destructive  testing
techniques? Any comments from anyone?

Dr.  WOMACK.  I  guess  I  can  go  first.  I  don’t  think  it  is  due  to  a
lack of research. We have technologies, many testing methods that
have been mentioned at this table. So we have the ability to do it.
I  think  you  are  more  right  in  terms  of  we  are  willing  to  pay  the

first  cost,  although  that  first  cost  that  we  are  willing  to  pay  is  the
lowest  we  can  get,  which  isn’t  always  the  best.  But  we  are  willing
to  make  that  first  cost.  Then  we  are  trying  to  catch  up  with  other
new bridges and other repairs, so we tend not to go back and spend
the  money  that  should  be  spent  in  terms  of  monitoring  the  infra-
structure  that  we  have.  And  so  I  think  we  need  to  continue  to  do
research  to  develop  new  technologies,  but  it  is  not  a  shortage  of
technologies that is creating the problem.

Mr. EHLERS. Okay. So, Mr. Bernhardt. You advocated continuous
inspection.  Is  there  much  of  an  additional  price  tag  to  that  com-
pared to the periodic investigations?

Mr.  BERNHARDT.  Certainly.  It  is  much  more  expensive  to  instru-
ment  a  bridge  up  that  initial  time.  Once  the  bridge  is  instru-
mented, then you get that continuous data stream. I will just make
clear too that I certainly don’t advocate that for every type of struc-
ture.  Certainly  focusing  that  on  the  more  high-risk  structures,  the
structurally  deficient  bridges,  the  fracture  critical  bridges,  I  mean,
that  is  a  good  use  of  that  type  of  technology.  Certainly  for  a  20-
foot  span  that  doesn’t  see  much  traffic  and  it  is  very  simple  struc-
turally,  there  is  really  no  need  to  go  to  that  kind  of  expense.  It  is
the  more  sophisticated  structures  that  you  want  to  use  that  tech-
nology  on.  And  certainly  as  Dr.  Womack  indicated,  technology  ex-
ists  now  to  do  those  things,  so  it  is  not  on  the  research  end.  It  is
getting  the  projects  funded  to  put  into  practice  where  the  shortfall
is.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you.  Mr.  James,  you  were  kind  enough  to
single out the State of Michigan as having an excellent bridge man-
agement system. Frankly I don’t know of any bridges that have col-
lapsed recently in the State of Michigan, and we have built the Big
Mac  which  has  stood  firm  for  50  years  now  this  year.  I  appreciate
your  comments.  But  again,  this  is  another  related  question  about
causes  of  bridge  failure.  You  mentioned  scouring.  That  applies  to
any bridge. Michigan, as well as Minnesota, suffer a lot of damage
through  the  freeze-thaw  cycle,  Michigan  much  more  than  Min-
nesota  because  Minnesota,  for  better  or  for  worse,  freezes  over  in
November  and  doesn’t  thaw  until  March  sometimes.  I  used  to  live
there so I know. Whereas Michigan has probably 15 freeze-thaw cy-
cles  they  go  through  in  the  course  of  a  winter.  Maybe  that  is  ex-
treme  but  doesn’t  that  cause  a  lot  of  damage  to  bridges?  I  know  it
does  to  highways,  but  what  about  bridges?  Is  that  a  factor  there,
too, the constant temperature changes?

Mr.  JAMES.  Yes,  sir,  it  is,  and  that  is  taken  into  account  in  the
design of bridges and their construction and the materials and the
properties  of  the  concrete  for  instance  in  the  deck  when  they  are
constructed.  There  are  many  things  that  can  be  due  to  prescribe  a
particular  mix  that  will  minimize  or  at  least  mitigate  these  tem-
perature  changes  that  you  mentioned.  We  are  fortunate  in  the
south  that  we  don’t  experience  things  like  that.  We  typically  don’t
use  salt,  either,  because  we  don’t  have  the  ice  and  snow  to  deal
with  except,  you  know,  those  very  few  times  within  any  season.
There  are  things  that,  you  know,  can  be  done.  Again,  it  goes  back
to  doing  what  is  appropriate,  trying  to  narrow  the  focus  of  where
these technologies are needed to the high-risk bridge candidates as
much  as  possible  using  engineering—experience  counts  a  lot  for

what  you  are  doing.  Bridges  again  have  lives  50,  75,  even  100
years  in  some  cases.  Many  times  that  is  not  by  design  but  just  by
necessity  that  bridges  have  to  last  longer  than  they  were  ever
thought to. With that, if you look at a bridge that is 50 to 75 years
old, I have been with the state DOT almost 26 years. That is near-
ly  two  careers  for  somebody  in  my  position  to  see,  you  know,  the
life  of  a  bridge;  and  many  times,  it  takes  a  structure  that  is,  you
know,  30  to  40  years  old  before  something  comes  up,  very  similar
again to the analogy with a person; and you do whatever is appro-
priate. You know, you find something that requires constant moni-
toring,  you  look  at  it  until  you  get  it  arrested  or  corrected.  If  you
find  something  else  that  you  need  to  look  at,  you  look  at  it  once
and  then  you  don’t  go  back  in  there.  You  wouldn’t  expect  to  find
it  again  for  five  to  10  more  years.  However  you  would  still  do  the
routine  physical  so  to  speak,  the  visual  inspection  of  the  bridges.
Mr.  EHLERS.  And  one  last  quick  question  on  a  slightly  different
subject  but  same  problem.  Dams,  and  I  am  not  talking  now  about
the huge dams, I am talking about the smaller dams that we have
dotting  the  landscape  of  our  country  that  we  used  for  power  gen-
eration  years  ago.  Is  it  as  important  to  have  a  constant  inspection
program  for  the  dams?  Is  that  as  much  of  a  problem  or  don’t  they
suffer as much stress or as much failure as the bridges?

Mr.  JAMES.  While  those  are  not  under  my  purview  as  highway
engineer,  in  many  cases  we  have  dams  adjacent  to  roadways,  and
obviously we are concerned with them. Many states or most states
have monitoring procedures whereas dams have to be inspected on
some  frequency,  just  similarly  to  bridges;  and  where  appropriate,
they could be monitored and from that monitoring you could deter-
mine whether or not that you have an intrinsic or chronic problem
with a structure.

Mr. EHLERS. My time has expired. I yield back. Thank you.
Mr. WU. Thank you very much, Dr. Ehlers. We have a floor vote
coming  up  fairly  soon,  so  we  are  going  to  proceed  with  another
round  of  questions.  We  will  probably  proceed  pretty  quickly,  and
the Chairman recognizes himself.

There  are  bridges  in  this  country  that  have  lasted  50  or  100
years.  There  are  bridges  elsewhere,  the  Roman  aqueducts,  bridges
in  China,  that  have  lasted  1,000  years;  and  the  bridges  that  have
lasted  a  long  time  were  both  conservatively,  perhaps  over-engi-
neered,  they  have  lasted  a  long  time.  We  have  newer  bridges  that
are  being  built  with  the  assistance  of  computer  modeling  and,  you
know, just going if you will closer to the limits of what design and
materials  can  do.  Do  these  new  designs  necessitate  different  ap-
proaches to bridge inspection and bridge safety?

Mr.  BERNHARDT.  Yeah,  I  would  certainly  answer  yes  to  that
question.  A  good  example  would  be  the  use  of  post-tensioning  or
pre-stressing of concrete beams in bridges. You may have post-ten-
sioning  cables  inside  of  a  bridge  to  give  it  strength,  but  you  could
never  see  through  those  cables.  So  certainly  you  constructed  a
bridge where one of the primary structural elements you will never
be  able  to  visually  see.  In  that  case,  you  must  have  some  type  of
sophisticated,  non-destructive  evaluation  method  to  examine  those
structural elements 25 years from now, 50 years from now as those
elements start to deteriorate inside the bridge itself.

Dr. WOMACK. Let me add a couple of words to that. This is where
I  think  the  research  in  non-destructive  evaluation  can  occur.  We
have  developed  technologies  to  look  at  the  bridges  we  have.  Now,
with these newer bridges and newer construction methods, we don’t
necessarily have the technologies to assess those as in post-tension
or pre-tension bridges. So we need to develop through research con-
cepts  that  we  can  use  to  non-destructively  evaluate  these  newer
types  of  bridges.  So  along  with  the  new  design,  we  need  to  come
up with new ways of evaluating them through testing.

Mr.  JUDYCKI.  Let  me  just  add  a  couple  of  things  and  then  just
ask Mr. Tang to follow up. Quite a lot of the research investments
now  are  in  new  materials  for  bridges  and  it  is  critically  important
that  as  we  explore  the  application  of  new  material,  ultra-high-per-
formance  concrete,  high-performance  steels  and  so  forth—that  we
assure in advance that we build that into codes and standards and
specifications  as  we  implement  around  the  country.  SAFETEA–LU
in fact directs quite a lot of resources into research into new mate-
rials that will lead to new designs as we conduct our research.

Also,  I  had  mentioned  earlier  the  Bridge  of  the  Future.  Much  of
what  we  are  talking  about  really  needs  to  be  put  in  the  context  of
where we should be looking for the future and where research can
bring  us  in  the  future.  The  Long-Term  Bridge  Performance  Pro-
gram  was  mentioned  by  a  couple  of  people  here  at  the  table.  And
it  is  critically  important  that  we  collect  information  and  data  over
a long-term so that we can develop predictive models on deteriora-
tion  and  impacts  of  maintenance  on  bridge  systems.  When  we  are
really  talking  about  a  bridge  of  the  future,  that  we  will  have
bridges  that  are  not  only  constructed  with  ultra-high-performance
materials  but  also  sensing  systems  that  will  help  us  a  great  deal
in overcoming some of the barriers that we are now facing with in-
spection programs.

Mr.  TANG.  Mr.  Chair,  I  believe  when  you  mentioned  about  the
deterioration  rate  of  different  types  of  bridges,  they  indeed  have
differences.  Most  of  the  damage  comes  from  corrosion,  and  if  you
look at the bridges that we built in the past, corrosion has been the
major  contributor  to  bridge  deficiency;  and  as  a  result,  Federal
Highway has done a lot of research on corrosion aspect of it. If you
look  at  20  years  ago,  25  years  ago,  we  didn’t  have  any  corrosion
protection  on  our  deck.  Federal  Highway  went  out  and  did  the  re-
search,  and  using  the  results,  we  are  now  requiring,  or  we  then
have  required  a  corrosion  protection  system  on  our  deck  system  to
make it last longer. And also, our corrosion research in our Turner-
Fairbank  Facility  has  also  looked  at  epoxy-coated  rebar,  and  now
we are looking at galvanizing those rebar and stainless steel, which
we  are  implementing  in  our  projects  now.  And  in  the  design  code,
the  AASHTO  LRFD  code  requires  a  75-year  design  life,  and  they
actually have criteria specifying that design life to be considered in
the design.

Mr.  WU.  Thank  you  very  much.  My  understanding  is  that  Mr.

Hall has no further questions at this point. Dr. Gingrey?

Mr.  GINGREY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  want  to  state  at  the
outset  when  I  made  that  comment  about  directed  initiatives  and
the  concern  that  it  might  handcuff  the  bureaucrats  as  we  like  to
say sometimes, not meaning that in a pejorative way from making

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:07 Jan 20, 2008 Jkt 037641 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL07\091907\37641 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

decisions,  certainly  my  colleague  from  Texas,  if  every  Member’s
member initiatives were as good and honest and forthright as hers
are,  we  wouldn’t  have  a  problem  with  earmarks  I  am  sure.  But  I
just,  you  know,  brought  that  up  because  I  am  concerned  that
maybe there are certain areas in which member initiatives may not
be  appropriate  if  it  takes  funding  away  from  something  that  we
need to do.

But  let  me  get  to  my  question.  I  just  wonder  if  there  is  some
technique  other  than  visual  inspection.  We  talked  about  that  a  lot
at  this  hearing,  and  we  know  that  we  have  good  visual  inspectors.
But  is  there  some  technique  non-destructive  that  can  be  used  as  a
retrofit  for  existing  bridges?  The  bridge  of  the  future,  I  think  that
is  probably  easier  to  deal  with  in  how  we  construct  new  bridges
and  sensors  and  things  that  we  can  put.  But  is  there  something
that  we  can  use  in  existing  structures  in  a  non-destructive  way
that goes far beyond visual inspection?

Mr. BERNHARDT. I will take a stab at that one. Basically I think
what  you  are  asking  is—I  mean,  there  is  no  magic  bullet,  first  of
all. There are many different types of bridges, and what technique
works  on  one  certain  type  of  bridge  will  not  work  on  another  one.
So  there  are  many  specific  types  of  testing  that  work  on  specific
bridges.  I  think  what  holds  the  greatest  promise  would  be  struc-
tural  health  monitoring.  If  you  can  instrument  a  bridge  and  thus
know day to day a little bit more about what is going on inside that
bridge,  that  reduces  your  level  of  risk.  I  mean,  engineers  tend  to
be conservative by nature, and if I have to make a decision to close
a  bridge  or  keep  it  open,  I  am  going  to  typically  be  conservative.
But  if  I  have  hard  data  that  I  can  look  at  each  day  that  lets  me
know  how  that  bridge  is  behaving,  then  maybe  I  can  stretch  the
life  of  that  bridge  a  little  bit  longer  because  I  get  a  better  comfort
level since I am getting that data. So instrumentation can give you
that.

Mr. GINGREY. Anybody else want to comment on that?
Mr.  TANG.  Yes,  I  believe  some  of  the  sensor  technology  is  very
good, and some of the existing bridges we have used acoustic emis-
sion  monitoring  or  ultrasonic  type  testing  device  and  sensor  tech-
nology  on  that  now  we  are  hoping  to  research  to  find  ways  to  put
them  into  practice.  For  example,  it  is  not  like  one-size-fits-all  as
Mr.  Judycki  mentioned  earlier.  We  have  to  look  at  the  specific
problem  and  the  nature  of  the  needs  of  the  bridge.  I  think  there
are  technologies  out  there  that  will  be  appropriate,  and  we  just
need to further develop them because right now a lot of that infor-
mation  is  available,  but  it  is  not  proven.  And  as  Mr.  James  men-
tioned earlier, we are looking at proven technology. And so it would
take  time  to  develop  some  of  these  into  usable  results  so  that  you
don’t  just  have  a  lot  of  data  coming  in  and  not  knowing  what  to
do with those data.

Mr. GINGREY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Mr.  WU.  Thank  you.  And  as  we  bring  this  hearing  to  a  close,  I

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Dennis  C.  Judycki,  Associate  Administrator,  Research,  Development,
and  Technology,  Federal  Highway  Administration,  U.S.  Department  of  Trans-
portation

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. One of the major challenges facing the Nation’s bridges is significant growth in
traffic  loads,  including  a  greatly  increased  number  of  long  haul  trucks,  which
stress bridges far beyond the loads engineers originally anticipated. In his testi-
mony,  Mr.  James  said  that  the  volume  of  freight  is  actually  expected  to  double
in  the  next  20  years.  How  do  current  research  projects,  such  as  the  Bridge  of
the  Future  project  at  FHWA,  take  into  account  the  continuing  growth  in  the
number  of  cars  and  trucks  using  bridges?  Do  we  need  additional  research  or
data  to  accurately  model  the  types  of  loads  bridges  will  be  handling  in  50  or
100 years?

A1. The  issue  of  traffic  growth  impacts  existing  structures  more  so  than  newly  de-
signed  structures.  Today’s  bridge  codes  and  standards  account  for  the  current  legal
weight of trucks, regardless of the number of vehicles. Assuming that truck weights
do  not  increase  significantly,  structures  designed  today  should  be  able  to  accommo-
date  the  volume  of,  and  growth  in,  the  number  of  vehicles  crossing  a  typical  high-
way bridge in the United States.

However, traffic growth will impact existing structures, especially those that were
constructed  in  the  1940s  through  1970s,  more  directly.  Legal  truck  loads  have  in-
creased  over  this  time,  resulting  in  a  number  of  ‘‘load  posted’’  bridges  throughout
the United States. In addition, our knowledge of how certain types of steel and con-
crete  members  and  details  perform  under  repetitive  loading  has  increased  since
these  structures  were  designed  and  constructed.  Bridge  owners  are  fully  aware  of
the  potential  impacts  and  solutions  required  to  provide  adequate  levels  of  safety  in
these existing structures under the current maximum legal vehicle weights. This is
typically done by limiting the maximum loading, inspecting important structural de-
tails with more advanced tools and on a more frequent basis, or by retrofitting these
structural details.

Two  FHWA  programs,  the  Bridge  of  the  Future  and  the  Long-Term  Bridge  Per-
formance Program, are directly focused on providing better knowledge and tools for
ensuring long, reliable service of the Nation’s highway structures. The Bridge of the
Future  project  is  focused  on  design,  materials,  and  construction  practices  that  will
make  possible  significantly  longer  performance  for  newly  constructed  (or  recon-
structed)  bridges,  so  that  they  require  less  maintenance  in  the  future,  while  also
being more readily adaptable to meet changes in demand (for example, simple meth-
ods  to  add  additional  lanes  when  traffic  volumes  increase  significantly).  The  Long-
Term  Bridge  Performance  Program  is  focused  on  developing  quantitative  data  on
the things that impact existing bridge performance, such as load, environment, and
typical  maintenance  practices.  This  program  will  result  in  better  knowledge  and
tools  to  more  effectively  and  economically  manage  the  hundreds  of  thousands  of
highway structures in the future.
Q2. Many bridge inspection technologies are not adopted by State DOTs because in-
spectors simply find them too technical and difficult to use. How can we balance
the need for detailed, accurate information and user friendly design?

A2. The  problems  that  bridge  inspectors  experience  are  similar  to  problems  experi-
enced  in  the  inspection  of  other  types  of  infrastructure,  including  buildings,  pipe-
lines,  offshore  oil  platforms,  and  dams.  There  is  therefore  a  significant  amount  of
effort ongoing throughout the United States and worldwide to develop new and im-
proved  infrastructure  inspection  tools  and  approaches.  As  a  result,  the  state-of-the-
art  in  infrastructure  inspection  is  changing  and  improving  on  a  continuous  basis
and we anticipate dramatic improvements in these inspections tools and their avail-
ability in the next five to ten years.

There  are  several  impediments,  however,  to  the  adoption  of  these  new  tools  and
technologies  by  bridge  inspectors.  As  pointed  out,  some  of  the  current  tools  are  too
technical or difficult to use, especially in the harsh environments and difficult access
typically  found  at  bridges.  This  is  being  overcome  by  continuous  improvement  in
these  technologies—by  making  the  information  provided  more  readily  understand-
able; by making the tools smaller, lighter, and more portable; and by decreasing the
cost  so  that  bridge  owners  and  inspectors  can  better  afford  these  new  tools.  How-
ever, education and training on the use of these new tools is also required. Through

the  training  courses  developed  and  delivered  by  our  National  Highway  Institute,
FHWA  educates  inspectors  on  new  technologies  to  overcome  the  issues  of  technical
complexity. FHWA is committed to working with industry and bridge owners to ad-
dress each of the potential impediments.
Q3. Of the new technologies developed at Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center
or in collaboration with FHWA, how many are currently in use by bridge inspec-
tors?  Which  programs,  such  as  the  Local  Technical  Assistance  Program  or  Na-
tional  Highway  Institute  courses,  have  been  most  effective  for  technology  trans-
fer? What have been the biggest barriers to adoption, and what has FHWA done
to try to overcome those barriers?

A3. Over  the  past  15  to  20  years,  a  number  of  bridge  inspection  and  monitoring
technologies have been developed or supported through the efforts of FHWA’s Turn-
er-Fairbank  Highway  Research  Center  (TFHRC).  Overall,  we  can  identify  approxi-
mately  15  specific  sensors  and  system  types,  many  of  which  have  been  commer-
cialized or are currently being refined for use by the commercial sector.

Examples of these technologies include the following:

• FHWA  developed  a  system  to  measure  vertical  and  rotational  stiffness  of
bridge  foundations  using  truck  loads  as  a  method  to  differentiate  between
shallow  and  deep  foundations  on  bridges  where  the  foundation  type  is  un-
known.  The  methodology  was  subsequently  commercialized  and  is  currently
available from a firm located in Arlington, MA.

• FHWA  developed  three-dimensional  imaging  capabilities  using  ground  pene-
trating  radar  (GPR)  technology,  enhancing  the  ability  of  GPR  to  detect  dete-
rioration  in  concrete  bridge  decks.  The  technology  has  been  adopted  by  com-
mercial  GPR  venders  and  is  used  for  rapid  evaluations  of  multiple  bridge
decks,  providing  information  for  bridge  management  and  asset  management
decision-making.

• FHWA  developed  a  sensor  to  passively  measure  the  maximum  strain  experi-
enced  on  a  bridge  to  detect  and  quantify  overloading.  The  sensor  has  been
commercialized and is currently available from a firm in Alpharetta, GA.

• In  cooperation  with  Southwest  Research  Institute  (San  Antonio,  TX),  FHWA
developed  and  evaluated  systems  for  testing  large  bridge  cables  using  the
magnetic  flux  leakage  principle.  The  technology  has  since  been  commer-
cialized and is being marketed by several companies.

• FHWA  developed  methods  and  engineered  systems  for  rapidly  applying  ther-
mal  imaging  for  the  detection  of  defects  in  concrete  bridge  components.  This
has  since  been  commercialized  and  is  marketed  as  Infrared  Thermography,
and is used on a limited basis for bridge inspection.

FHWA  continues  to  support  the  development  of  new  bridge  inspection  and  moni-
toring  technologies  and  to  assist  in  the  improvement  of  existing  technologies.  We
also actively promote and provide assistance in the use of these systems. Ultimately,
however, a key measure of success of any highway technology depends on its accept-
ance  by  stakeholders  on  a  national  scale.  FHWA’s  responsibilities  for  research  and
technology (R&T) include not only managing and conducting research, but also shar-
ing the results of completed research projects, and supporting and facilitating tech-
nology and innovation deployment.

The FHWA Resource Center is a central location for obtaining highway technology
deployment  assistance.  Similarly,  education  and  training  programs  are  provided
through  the  FHWA  National  Highway  Institute.  These,  along  with  the  capabilities
provided  by  the  Local  Technical  Assistance  Program  (LTAP),  Highways  for  LIFE,
and  other  similar  DOT-sponsored  programs  and  activities  provide  the  basis  for  an
effective technology transfer program.

There  are,  however,  a  number  of  barriers  to  technology  deployment  that  may  ex-
plain the relatively slow adoption of highway technologies that appear cost effective.
Lack  of  information  about  new  technologies  is  one  barrier  that  may  be  overcome
with  information  and  outreach  programs.  Long-standing  familiarity  with  existing
technologies, gained through education or experience, also may hamper the adoption
of newer technologies, but the education and training programs provided by FHWA
and others often help to transcend these types of barriers.

It  also  may  be  difficult  for  stakeholders  to  envision  the  long-range  benefits  of  a
new technology relative to initial investment costs, especially if the payback (break-
even)  period  is  long.  Even  if  stakeholders  are  aware  of  eventual  cost  savings  from
a more efficient or effective highway technology, they may have confidence in tradi-
tional  methods.  Demonstration  projects  that  provide  hands-on  experience  can  help

72

tip  the  scale  so  that  stakeholders  are  willing  to  apply  innovative  technologies  to
long-standing safety and asset measurement and protection problems.

Despite  these  efforts,  technology  deployment  often  is  slowed  by  residual  uncer-
tainties  about  performance,  reliability,  installation,  and  maintenance  costs;  avail-
ability of the next generation of the technology; and the need for the necessary tech-
nical and physical infrastructure to support the technology in question.
Q4. In  his  testimony,  Dr.  Womack  argues  that  the  laboratories  at  Turner-Fairbank
Highway Research Center (TFHRC) are underutilized. At what percentage of ca-
pacity  are  the  labs  at  TFHRC  being  used?  What  types  of  projects  are  being  de-
layed or foregone because of budgetary and other limitations?

A4. Research  and  development  work  conducted  by  the  Federal  Highway  Adminis-
tration  is  managed  and  directed  by  FHWA  technical  experts,  and  is  primarily
awarded  through  competitive  contracts.  Much  of  the  work  is  done  at  the  TFHRC—
the  only  national  highway  research  center  in  the  United  States—or  is  managed  by
FHWA  research  staff.  In  addition  to  competitive  contracts,  FHWA  also  works  in
close  collaboration  with  University  Transportation  Research  Centers  (UTCs),  and
with  other  organizations  in  limited  situations  via  cooperative  agreements  and  re-
search grants.

The  FHWA  bridge  and  structures  R&T  program  is  authorized  in  SAFETEA–LU
through  the  Surface  Transportation  Research,  Development,  and  Deployment  Pro-
gram  (STRDD).  However,  statutorily  designated  projects  and  programs  in  STRDD
actually  exceed  the  authorized  contract  authority  of  $196.4  million  for  fiscal  years
(FYs)  2006–2009.  The  over-earmarking  of  all  authorized  STRDD  funding  neces-
sitates  across-the-board  funding  reductions  and  results  in  FHWA  being  unable  to
provide for any discretionary or flexible spending beyond those earmarks. This lack
of  flexible  funds  severely  limits  FHWA’s  ability  to  investigate  and  respond  to  cur-
rent or emerging research needs that do not have specific statutory funding.

In  addition,  this  lack  of  R&T  funding  flexibility  within  SAFETEA–LU  does  not
allow  FHWA  to  carry  out  some  critical  programs  and  initiatives.  For  example,  as
a result of the I–35W bridge collapse in Minnesota, the country recognizes the need
for  a  higher  level  of  investment  to  improve  bridge  inspection  and  evaluation  tech-
nology.  The  lack  of  flexibility  and  the  full  designation  of  all  SAFETEA–LU  R&T
funds, however, prevent FHWA from adjusting priorities as a result of tragedies like
I–35W.

Some  TFHRC  structures  R&T  program  laboratories,  including  the  main  struc-
tures  testing  facility,  are  essentially  at  capacity  as  a  result  of  programs  authorized
in  SAFETEA–LU  and  included  in  the  annual  FHWA  appropriations.  Other  labora-
tories,  such  as  the  aerodynamics,  hydraulics,  and  bridge  management  information
systems laboratories, have only marginal funding via SAFETEA–LU, but have effec-
tively leveraged other sources of funding so they can continue to conduct important
research  and  technology  studies.  Leveraging  funding  from  multiple  States  via  the
Transportation  Pooled  Fund  (TPF)  program  is  an  example.  However,  the  lack  of
flexibility  noted  above  does  impact  FHWA’s  ability  to  address  national  research
needs and priorities to which these laboratories could contribute.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. In 2004 the Federal Bridge Program provided $6.6 billion in aid in addition to
$3.9  billion  in  State  and  local  funding  yielding  approximately  $10.5  billion  a
year  in  bridge  rehabilitation  and  construction  investments.  Compared  to  this
amount,  how  much  money  is  invested  in  bridge  safety  research  and  develop-
ment? How does the funding for bridge related research compare to the total re-
search  investment  in  the  transportation  sector?  Has  the  funding  received  by
Turner-Fairbank  been  sufficient  to  keep  your  experts  working  at  full  capacity?
A1. The  Surface  Transportation  Research,  Development,  and  Deployment  Program
(STRDD)  has  contract  authority  of  $196.4  million  but,  in  FY  2007,  was  funded  at
only $180.8 million due to the limitation on obligations. Of the $180.8 million, about
$22.4  million  (12.4  percent)  was  designated  for  bridge  and  structures  research  and
technology.

For  STRDD,  statutory  earmarks  and  statutorily  designated  programs  authorized
in  SAFETEA–LU  total  $228.8  million  in  FY  2007,  which  exceeds  the  authorized
funding level. With the cuts required to all STRDD programs in order to stay within
contract  authority  and  those  required  to  stay  within  the  obligation  ceiling,  only
about 79 percent of the authorized funds were made available.

However,  the  designation  and  earmarking  of  all  authorized  STRDD  funding  for
FYs  2006–2009  created  more  of  an  issue  than  a  funding  cut.  Over-designation  and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:07 Jan 20, 2008 Jkt 037641 PO 00000 Frm 00076 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL07\091907\37641 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

73

over-earmarking  also  resulted  in  the  inability  to  provide  for  any  discretionary
spending.  Thus,  there  is  no  funding  for  a  number  of  programs  that  are  authorized
by  Congress,  and  FHWA  believes  are  critical  to  delivering  a  sound  R&T  program,
but which do not have specific statutory funding. Annually, there are about $30 mil-
lion  in  research  and  technology  activities  and  programs  that  were  funded  in  the
Transportation  Equity  Act  for  the  21st  Century  (TEA–21),  the  authorizing  legisla-
tion  prior  to  SAFETEA–LU,  that  are  not  able  to  be  funded  in  SAFETEA–LU  be-
cause all STRDD funds are designated.

In  addition  to  bridge  and  structures  research  being  conducted  by  FHWA,  a  num-
ber of other organizations sponsor bridge research, and a much larger group of agen-
cies  conducts  bridge  R&T.  Included  among  these  are  State  DOTs,  industry,  other
federal  agencies,  and  academia.  FHWA  actively  coordinates  the  National  research
program with our partners and stakeholders for agenda-setting, and in the conduct
of  research  and  delivery  of  new  innovations.  FHWA  staff  participate  in  numerous
national and international organizations and serve on committees focused on bridge
research,  development,  and  technology  transfer.  FHWA  organizes  formal  technical
advisory groups and technical working groups, comprised of federal, State, and local
transportation  officials;  bridge  engineering  consultants  and  industry  groups;  and
academia.  Further,  numerous  organizations  in  other  countries  also  conduct  bridge
research,  and  other  transportation  modes,  including  the  railroad  industry,  conduct
a limited amount of bridge research.

FHWA  technical  staff  at  the  Turner-Fairbank  Highway  Research  Center  fulfill
several  important  roles.  In  addition  to  the  conduct  of  applied  and  advanced  re-
search, they support the deployment and transfer of new technologies, and also pro-
vide  technical  assistance  to  states,  the  National  Transportation  Safety  Board,  and
others.  The  range  of  needs,  whether  it  be  important  research  studies  or  technical
assistance  requests,  far  exceed  the  time  and  resources  available  to  address  these
needs. FHWA staff therefore work on a continuous basis essentially at capacity.
Q2. How many privately owned bridges are part of the public roadway system? Since
these bridges are not required to be inspected as part of the National Bridge In-
ventory,  do  we  have  any  data  reflecting  the  structural  health  and  safety  of  pri-
vately held bridges?

A2. The  December  2006  National  Bridge  Inventory  (NBI)  identifies  roughly  1,865
privately  owned  highway  bridges.  However,  the  actual  total  number  of  privately
owned  highway  bridges  is  unknown  because  the  states  are  not  required  to  report
them to the FHWA.

Condition information is available for those privately owned highway bridges that

are currently identified in the NBI.
Q3. In  Mr.  Bernhardt’s  testimony,  he  aptly  notes  that,  simply  collecting  more  data
and  providing  more  frequent  inspections  will  not  improve  overall  bridge  safety:
and that eventually bridges must be rehabilitated or replaced. The age distribu-
tion  for  all  U.S.  bridges  is  remarkably  flat,  however.  Twenty-five  percent  are
under  20  years  old.  Over  half  the  bridges  in  the  U.S.  are  under  40  years  old,
and  over  eighty  percent  are  under  55  years  old.  How  much  do  we  know  now
about  the  rates  of  deterioration  for  bridges  and  how  those  rates  change  over
time?  Are  we  confident  that  current  levels  of  investment  for  bridge  replacement
will not keep up with rehabilitation needs?

A3. Significant  research  has  been  conducted  on  the  deterioration  rates  of  bridges
and  the  individual  elements  comprising  bridges.  The  rate  of  deterioration  is  influ-
enced  by  many  factors.  These  include  the  original  design  of  the  structure,  the  cli-
mate  where  the  bridge  is  located,  the  load  carried  by  the  bridge  over  time,  and  the
type  of  maintenance  activities  performed  on  the  bridge.  The  combination  of  this
wide number of factors complicates the prediction of the rate of deterioration for an
individual structure.

It  is  widely  recognized  by  FHWA  and  others  that  the  type  of  data  currently  col-
lected  and  maintained  in  the  National  Bridge  Inventory  (NBI)  is  not  adequate  for
developing  sophisticated  deterioration  and  life  cycle  cost  models  for  bridge  compo-
nents  and  structures.  That  is  why  the  Administration  requested,  and  Congress  au-
thorized, the Long-Term Bridge Performance Program (LTBPP) in the surface trans-
portation  reauthorization  legislation  that  ultimately  became  SAFETEA–LU.  The
LTBPP  is  intended  to  collect  much  more  detailed  information  and  quantified  data
on  specific  bridge  elements  for  a  small  but  representative  population  of  bridges.
Much of this data will be obtained through advanced testing and analysis. This de-
tailed data can then be used to enhance and improve existing deterioration models,
improve design and inspection practices, and identify cost-beneficial preservation ac-
tivities.

74

While  it  is  understood  that  the  collection  of  more  data  will  not  in  itself  improve
overall bridge safety, the information gathered through such activities can be useful
in  the  selection  and  timing  of  maintenance  procedures  to  be  conducted  on  the
bridge.  The  application  of  properly  timed  and  appropriate  maintenance  procedures
can  significantly  extend  the  normal  service  life  of  structures,  allowing  many  older
bridges to function adequately well beyond their original estimated design life.

The 2006 Status of the Nation’s Highways, Bridges and Transit: Conditions & Per-
formance  report  to  Congress  had  projected  that  the  combined  level  of  bridge  reha-
bilitation  and  replacement  investment  by  all  levels  of  government  in  2004  of  $10.5
billion  would  be  adequate  to  reduce  but  not  eliminate  the  current  backlog  of  eco-
nomically  justifiable  bridge  investments,  if  this  spending  level  were  sustained  in
constant  dollar  terms  over  20  years.  The  Maximum  Economic  Investment  scenario
presented in the report projected that an average annual investment of $12.4 billion
(in 2004 dollars) by all levels of government would be needed to eliminate the exist-
ing bridge investment backlog and correct other deficiencies that are expected to de-
velop over the next 20 years.
Q4. Mr. Bernhardt testimony notes that a FHWA study in 2001 determined that less
than  eight  percent  of  inspectors  could  successfully  locate  certain  defects  in  test
bridges. How confident are you in the current inspection regime’s ability to con-
sistently identify potential safety hazards? How confident are you that they iden-
tify  needed  repairs  before  they  become  major  reconstruction?  How  does  FHWA
ensure  that  its  training  courses  are  up  to  date  and  effective  in  transferring
knowledge to the trainees?

A4. The  2001  FHWA  report  identified  several  concerns  with  the  type  and  quality
of inspections at that time. However, it must be recognized that this was only a very
limited  sample  and  did  not  completely  represent  actual  bridge  inspection  practices.
The  research  methodology  that  was  used  had  several  important  limitations,  includ-
ing the following:

• The  inspectors  involved  in  the  project  were  not  necessarily  representative  or
had  the  level  of  training  required  of  those  who  conduct  in-depth  or  fracture
critical  member  inspections,  yet  they  were  tasked  to  do  so  as  part  of  this
study.
• The  inspectors  involved  in  the  study  were  not  provided  with  any  history  on
the sample bridges and were not able to take advantage of previous engineer-
ing analysis or information. Such information is typically reviewed by the in-
spector prior to conducting the next inspection on that same structure.

As  a  result  of  the  study  and  its  recommendations,  a  number  of  improvements
were  made  to  the  National  Bridge  Inspection  Standards.  Specifically,  the  regula-
tions  were  revised  to  incorporate  a  requirement  to  establish  quality  control/quality
assurance procedures, along with additional training and refresher training require-
ments.  Inspector  training  courses  and  certification  requirements  were  also  up-
graded, providing for a higher level of inspector competency. And, a number of clari-
fications  were  provided  to  the  definitions  and  descriptors  that  inspectors  use  in  re-
porting the results of the inspections.

The  results  of  this  study  were  widely  publicized  by  FHWA,  thereby  creating  a
broad awareness of the issues and greater attention to the need for improved qual-
ity.  This  report  certainly  provided  a  wakeup  call  regarding  some  aspects  of  the  na-
tional  bridge  inspection  program,  and  spurred  significant  improvements  in  the  pro-
gram.  However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  for  the  current  investigation  on  the  I–
35W  bridge  in  Minneapolis,  there  are  no  indications  that  the  collapse  occurred  as
a result of deficiencies in the State’s inspection program.
Q5. Many  of  the  witnesses  mentioned  the  Long-Term  Bridge  Performance  Program
in their testimony as particularly critical to bridge construction, inspection, and
rehabilitation  research  programs.  As  I  understand  it,  the  program  is  to  provide
longitudinal data on the wear and tear on a variety of common bridge structures
in  the  U.S.  How  does  this  data  differ  from  what’s  been  collected  as  part  of  the
National  Bridge  Inventory  for  the  past  40  years?  Why  don’t  we  have  records  of
the  actual  performance  data  of  all  bridges  in  the  NBI  and  why  can’t  those
records be used for statistical studies of the effects of deterioration and increased
use?

A5. The National Bridge Inventory (NBI) contains information at the bridge compo-
nent  level.  For  example,  no  matter  how  large  a  bridge,  the  overall  condition  of  an
entire  superstructure  is  represented  by  a  single  number  on  a  scale  of  0  to  9.  While
the overall ratings contained in the NBI can be used to some extent to judge bridge
performance, they are limited in their level of detail and sophistication.

75

It is recognized that the NBI component ratings are based primarily on visual ob-
servations.  Through  the  Long-Term  Bridge  Performance  Program  (LTBPP),  the  in-
tent  is  to  collect  much  more  detailed  information  and  quantified  data  on  specific
bridge  elements  for  a  small  but  representative  population  of  bridges.  Much  of  this
data will be obtained through advanced testing and analysis. This detailed data can
then be used to enhance and improve existing deterioration models, improve design
and inspection practices, and identify cost-beneficial preservation activities.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Harry Lee James, Deputy Executive Director and Chief Engineer, Mis-
sissippi  Department  of  Transportation;  Member,  Standing  Committee  on  High-
ways, American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. In  his  testimony,  Dr.  Womack  argued  that  the  bridge  deficiencies  which  garner
the  most  public  attention  are  usually  fixed  most  quickly,  which  typically  means
potholes are given greater priority than structural problems that are not part of
the deck or roadway. What can the Federal Government, State governments, aca-
demia, and the private sector do to better communicate about bridge dangers to
the public?

A1. While  no  one  should  intentionally  hide  any  bridge  deficiencies  from  the  trav-
eling  public,  deficiencies  are  generally  of  a  technical  nature  such  that  the  general
public  may  not  understand  the  problem.  Bridges  carry  loads  across  them  and  the
practice  of  load  posting  a  bridge  with  a  deficiency  is  the  best  way  to  communicate
with the public about this subject. A public awareness campaign to inform the pub-
lic  what  load  posting  a  bridge  means  would  be  most  beneficial.  When  appropriate
precautions  are  taken  on  a  bridge  that  has  load  restrictions  the  bridge  is  not  dan-
gerous. We as a SHA do not operate unsafe bridges—we close them before they be-
comes dangerous.
Q2. In your testimony, you mention that 40 states employ an element-level inspection
protocol  that  is  beyond  the  federal  requirements.  How  does  this  additional  level
of  detail  help  you  prioritize  repairs  and  rehabilitation  for  your  state’s  bridges?
Should  this  type  of  inspection  be  required  for  all  National  Highway  System
bridges?

A2. The additional level of detail provided by the element-level inspection allows us
to  further  prioritize  repairs  that  are  needed  and  determine  the  urgency  of  making
those repairs. This level of inspection should be used where appropriate. It does not
provide any additional or useful information for certain type structures.
Q3. Has  the  Mississippi  DOT  adopted  any  new  technologies  for  bridge  inspection?
What kinds of technologies were most successful, and why? What sort of training
did  your  inspectors  need  to  effectively  use  the  new  technology?  For  those  tech-
nologies  you  decided  NOT  to  adopt,  what  was  your  reasoning  behind  that  deci-
sion?

A3. A few years ago MDOT purchased and received training for an ultrasound unit
that  can  detect  material  flaws  in  metal  structures  in  certain  instances.  While  this
is  not  new  technology  it  was  a  new  tool  for  us  to  have  on  hand.  The  training  was
provided  by  the  vendor  and  by  a  consultant  whom  we  had  contracted  with  in  the
past  to  perform  this  type  of  work  for  us.  It  was  helpful  to  have  the  capability  in-
house to use an advanced technology of this type. However, it also takes almost con-
stant  use  of  the  device  to  remain  proficient  with  this  technology.  Consequently,  we
still rely primarily on consultants to perform inspections using this technology.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. In 2004 the Federal Bridge Program provided $6.6 billion in aid in addition to
$3.9  billion  in  State  and  local  funding  yielding  approximately  $10.5  billion  a
year  in  bridge  rehabilitation  and  construction  investments.  Compared  to  this
amount,  how  much  money  is  invested  in  bridge  safety  research  and  develop-
ment? How does the funding for bridge related research compare to the total re-
search investment in the transportation sector?

A1. From  my  experience  6–8  percent  of  total  research  dollars  are  spent  on  bridge
related research. This number is consistent with the expenditures for research that
is conducted at the State level in MS as well.
Q2. In your testimony you suggest that the State of Michigan has successfully devel-
oped an asset management system that is improving bridge safety in that state.
However,  according  to  2005  and  2006  National  Bridge  Inventories,  Michigan
had  approximately  sixteen  percent  of  its  bridges  listed  as  structurally  deficient,
four  percent  above  the  national  average.  What  metrics  are  not  being  captured
by the NBI that point towards Michigan’s success in this area?

77

A2. One would have to know what their percentage of structurally deficient bridges
was  when  an  asset  management  system  was  implemented  in  MI  and  how  long  it
has  been  used.  To  see  noticeable  results  after  implementing  an  asset  management
system may take eight to ten years or more as it would have to be worked into the
project  development  process  with  ongoing  projects  that  were  not  prioritized  under
an  asset  management  system.  It  would  not  be  prudent  to  stop  work  on  a  project
that has a large investment in it already and that may be on the verge of correcting
a  deficiency  or  situation.  Stopping  work  on  a  project  just  because  it  has  not  gone
through an asset management system just doesn’t make sense.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Kevin  C.  Womack,  Director,  Utah  Transportation  Center;  Professor  of

Civil and Environmental Engineering, Utah State University

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. In your testimony, you argue that the laboratories at Turner-Fairbank Highway
Research Center (TFHRC) are underutilized. How does this affect bridge safety?
If  additional  funds  were  available,  what  types  of  projects  should  be  prioritized?
A1. The  underutilization  of  laboratories  at  the  Turner-Fairbank  Highway  Research
Center  (TFHRC)  has  a  significant  impact  on  bridge  safety.  These  laboratories  are
state-of-the-art, and capable of being utilized to research new materials, designs, in-
strumentation,  etc.  Allowing  these  labs  to  sit  idle  delays  the  opportunities  that  the
country has of implementing new technologies that could close the infrastructure in-
vestment gap. As for the issue of safety, concerns for the structural safety of bridges
that should be researched may not be, due to the lack of funding to run the TFHRC
laboratories.  These  could  be  issues  arising  from  the  I–35W  bridge  collapse  to  the
falling of panels in the Ted Williams Tunnel in Boston.

If additional funds were made available, the types of projects that should be exe-
cuted at TFHRC are of two types: First, the type that might be too large to do else-
where. The main structures lab at TFHRC is quite large and can handle very large
structural  elements  that  few  other  places  can  deal  with.  Second,  special  types  of
projects; those that might relate to unique types of bridges. The I–35W is an exam-
ple of this. It is of a fairly unique design, which raises unique types of issues. Other
bridges  of  this  ‘‘unique’’  type  could  range  from  the  Brooklyn  Bridge  to  the  Key
Bridge in Baltimore to the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Florida.

The  Long-Term  Bridge  Performance  (LTBP)  Program  will  handle  the  most  com-
mon  types  of  bridges  that  are  of  similar  designs,  structural  make-up  and  construc-
tion. The majority of Interstate bridges fall into this category. They are bridges with
simple steel or pre-cast concrete girders with cast-in-place decks. This type of bridge
probably occupies about 80 percent of the NHS bridge inventory. These bridges can
be  well  studied  under  the  LTBP  Program,  and  would  not  be  good  candidates  for
work in the TFHRC laboratories.
Q2. In  your  testimony,  you  argue  that  a  new  inspection  protocol  needs  to  be  devel-
oped for bridges. How would an updated inspection protocol differ from the cur-
rent  inspection  protocol?  What  types  of  technology  would  be  necessary  to  carry
out the updated inspections? Are these technologies currently available to inspec-
tors, and if not, what are the barriers to their adoption?

A2. A  new  well  defined  inspection  protocol  would  differ  from  the  existing  in  that
a  well  defined  existing  protocol  does  not  really  exist,  as  far  as  I  am  aware.  The  I–
35W  bridge  is  a  good  example  of  that.  It  was  inspected,  determined  to  be  struc-
turally  deficient,  but  then  there  was  a  quandary  about  what  to  do  next?  More  fre-
quent inspections, repair, instrumentation, etc., what to do? In the end, the decision
to inspect annually, rather than biannually, was made. Did that work, in hindsight
and all fairness to the Minnesota DOT, no; but would other DOT’s done differently?
Probably  not.  The  issue  becomes  one  of  cost.  To  instrument  such  a  bridge  in  a  way
that  could  provide  real  time  data  on  its  behavior  could  cost  $500,000.  To  perform
one  time  types  of  tests,  to  check  for  cracks,  etc.,  could  cost  upwards  of  $100,000.
To  repair,  possibly  millions  of  dollars  along  with  shutting  bridge  down  and  the  in-
convenience  that  would  cause.  To  perform  more  frequent  visual  inspections,  a  few
thousand  dollars.  But  in  the  end,  the  cost  could  near  $1  billion  in  terms  of  recon-
struction and costs to individuals (not to mention the indeterminable cost of the loss
of  life).  So  are  we  being  penny  wise  and  pound  foolish?  Perhaps.  This  is  not  to  say
that if things were done differently the I–35W Bridge would not still have collapsed,
you  simply  cannot  cover  all  the  possibilities,  but  a  better  chance  of  saving  the
bridge, and the lives, might have existed had things been done otherwise.

The  new  protocol  would  indicate  the  next  steps  that  should  be  taken  after  visual
inspection  determines  a  bridge  to  be  structural  deficient.  The  precise  reasons  for
such  a  rating  would  be  determined  and  the  next  steps  would  be  based  the  causes
of the structural deficient rating. Should the next steps be one time testing of bridge
elements  or  an  overall  load  rating  test;  or  constant,  real  time  monitoring  through
instrumentation;  or  minor  repairs;  or  immediate  closing  of  the  bridge;  all  of  this
needs  to  be  determined  and  developed  through  research  that  has  the  mandate  of
developing such a protocol.

As  for  the  technologies,  they  do  exist,  but  can  be  expensive,  thus  they  are  not
readily available to inspectors today. They can also be technically sophisticated and
need trained personnel to operate. Again, this costs money. If a DOT wanted to in-
strument  a  bridge  to  provide  real  time  performance  data  it  can  be  done,  and  has
been  done  on  a  segment  of  an  Interstate  bridge  in  Utah,  but  it  is  expensive.  Such
instrumentation  could  consist  of  accelerometers,  velocity  transducers  (geophones),
strain gauges, cameras, etc. All of which is available.

Currently, NBIS regulations have the first option to have a Professional Engineer
with  the  requisite  experience  and  training  to  perform  bridge  inspections  but  they
do  have  other  lesser  options  which  do  not  require  bridge  inspectors  to  be  Profes-
sional Engineers. ASCE believes that non-licensed bridge inspectors and technicians
may  be  used  for  routine  inspection  procedures  and  records,  but  the  pre-inspection
evaluation,  the  actual  inspection,  ratings,  and  condition  evaluations  should  be  per-
formed  by  licensed  Professional  Engineers  experienced  in  bridge  design  and  inspec-
tion. The NBIS regulations should be changed to require just Professional Engineers
with  appropriate  experience  such  as  the  expertise  to  know  the  load  paths,  critical
members, fatigue prone details, and past potential areas of distress in the particular
type  of  structure  being  inspected  as  the  lead  bridge  inspector.  They  must  have  the
ability  to  evaluate  not  only  the  condition  of  individual  bridge  components,  but  how
the components fit into and affect the load paths of the entire structure. The bridge
engineer  may  have  to  make  immediate  decisions  to  close  a  lane,  close  an  entire
bridge, or to take trucks off a bridge to protect the public safety.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. In  Mr.  Bernhardt’s  testimony,  he  aptly  notes  that,  ‘‘simply  collecting  more  data
and  providing  more  frequent  inspections  will  not  improve  overall  bridge  safety’’
and that eventually bridges must be rehabilitated or replaced. The age distribu-
tion  for  all  U.S.  bridges  is  remarkably  flat,  however.  Twenty-five  percent  are
under  20  years  old.  Over  half  the  bridges  in  the  U.S.  are  under  40  years  old,
and  over  eighty  percent  are  under  55  years  old.  How  much  do  we  know  now
about  the  rates  of  deterioration  for  bridges  and  how  those  rates  change  over
time?  Are  we  confident  that  current  levels  of  investment  for  bridge  replacement
will not keep up with rehabilitation needs?

A1. We do not know a lot about the rates of deterioration of bridges and how those
rates  change  over  time.  This  is  one  objective  of  the  Long-Term  Bridge  Performance
(LTBP) Program, to provide data that will give an indication as to how deterioration
occurs,  under  what  circumstances,  and  how  it  changes  with  time.  I  am  very  con-
fident that the current levels of investment will not keep up with the future repair
and replacement needs.

One  very  simple  reason  for  that  is  the  increase  in  the  cost  of  commodities  that
have  occurred  over  the  past  five  years.  Prices  for  steel,  cement,  aggregate,  and  last
but  not  least,  oil  have  increased  dramatically.  Much  of  this  is  due  to  development
overseas,  China  chief  among  these  countries.  There  is  little  evidence  that  these
countries are going to slow down their development in the near future.

You state in your question that over half the bridges in the country are less than
40  years  old,  looking  at  this  a  different  way,  then  a  number  approaching  half  the
bridges  in  the  country  are  more  than  40  years  old.  This  is  a  second  reason  I  am
sure  that  we  will  continue  to  experience  an  investment  gap.  A  typical  design  life
for  a  bridge  is  50  years,  as  these  bridges  approach  this  age,  they  will  need  to  be
repaired  or  replaced.  This  is  an  astronomical  number  of  bridges,  the  likes  of  which
we  have  not  had  to  deal  with  in  the  past,  and  we  cannot  even  keep  up  with  the
current surface transportation system investment needs.
Q2. Many  of  the  witnesses  mentioned  the  Long-Term  Bridge  Performance  Program
in their testimony as particularly critical to bridge construction, inspection, and
rehabilitation  research  programs.  As  I  understand  it,  the  program  is  to  provide
longitudinal data on the wear and tear on a variety of common bridge structures
in  the  U.S.  How  does  this  data  differ  from  what’s  been  collected  as  part  of  the
National  Bridge  Inventory  for  the  past  40  years?  Why  don’t  we  have  records  of
the  actual  performance  data  of  all  bridges  in  the  NBI  and  why  can’t  those
records be used for statistical studies of the effects of deterioration and increased
use?

A2. The National Bridge Inventory does not have any of the type of data that would
be  collected  from  the  Long-Term  Bridge  Performance  (LTBP)  Program.  The  LTBP
data  will  be  collected  mainly  through  live  load  testing,  instrumentation  to  provide
constant monitoring of bridge behaviors, and forensic testing of bridge elements that

will  be  taken  from  razed  bridges.  This  will  provide  data  outside  the  NBI,  and  will
help us to answer your first question about bridge deterioration.

We don’t have the records of performance data for bridges over the past 40 years
because the technologies in instrumentation and data collection that we have today
has  not  existed  over  that  time  period,  and  it  is  very  expensive.  Without  a  special
program  like  the  LTBP  Program,  with  funds  dedicated  to  this  purpose,  this  type  of
data would still not be collected on a large scale.

Question submitted by Representative Daniel Lipinski
Q1. In  your  written  testimony,  you  reference  a  current  shortage  of  civil  engineers  in
the United States, as well as a clear need for increased licensed professional en-
gineers.  How  do  you  believe  we  can  encourage  more  students  to  enter  this  field
of work?

A1. The  shortage  of  civil  engineers  and  civil  engineering  students  directly  impacts
the number of civil engineers that are currently licensed and will be licensed in the
future.  Much  of  this  problem  is  the  fault  of  the  civil  engineering  profession.  We,  as
a  profession,  have  done  a  poor  job  of  marketing  civil  engineering  as  a  profession.
Engineering students have to go through an undergraduate curriculum that is hard-
er  than  any  other  that  exists  on  a  college  campus,  more  difficult  than  even  those
that are used to enter MBA programs, law, medical or dental schools. Unless young
people  are  really  set  on  going  into  civil  engineering  they  do  not  see  the  point  in
going  through  such  a  difficult  curriculum  to  be  a  civil  engineer  when  they  can  be
a  doctor,  lawyer,  dentist,  aerospace  or  computer  engineer  and  make  much  more
money.

As  a  profession,  we  need  to  do  more  to  attract  young  people  to  civil  engineering.
We need to let them know of the dire need for civil engineers, particularly in trans-
portation.  We  also  need  to  make  salaries  that  young  civil  engineers  will  get  more
competitive  with  the  aerospace  and  electrical  engineers.  When  articles  such  as  the
one  in  USA  Today  on  October  12th  (Engineers  Step  up  Recruiting  Efforts)  appear
and show the salary disparity in the different types of engineering professions, with
civil  engineers  at  the  bottom,  it  is  difficult  to  recruit  civil  engineers.  The  market
will take care of some of this difference, but by the time the market really does react
and the principal of supply and demand creates a rise in the salaries for civil engi-
neers,  the  shortage  of  civil  engineers  will  be  extreme,  and  I  believe  harmful  to  the
infrastructure of this country due to the lack of properly trained engineers.

As for what the Congress might do to assist in this recruitment of civil engineers,
one thing that comes to mind is a loan forgiveness program as is done for educators.
If  a  person  graduates  in  an  accredited  civil  engineering  program  and  goes  to  work
for  a  city,  county,  state  or  other  type  of  governmental  agency  their  students  loans
could  be  forgiven  based  on  some  sort  of  schedule.  In  the  short-term,  this  could  al-
leviate  some  of  the  salary  disparity.  Another  approach  would  be  to  encourage  the
exposure  of  engineering  (all  types)  to  K–12  students.  Right  now  they  see  the
sciences, and are exposed to other professions in their daily lives, but K–12 age kids
really have little exposure to civil engineers.

Ultimately,  ASCE  believes  that  it  is  critical  to  provide  all  students,  no  matter
what  careers  they  ultimately  pursue,  with  a  strong  background  in  basic  mathe-
matics  and  science  to  enable  them  to  participate  in  our  increasingly  technical  soci-
ety.  We  must  prepare  those  students  who  want  to  pursue  careers  based  in  mathe-
matics and science with the necessary skills in these subjects. And finally, we must
encourage  highly  qualified  students  to  pursue  careers  based  in  mathematics  and
science and more specifically in civil engineering.

Over half of the economic growth today can be attributed directly to research and
development  in  science,  engineering  and  technology.  Our  ability  to  maintain  this
economic growth will be determined largely by our nation’s intellectual capital. The
only means to develop this resource is education.

Recent  assessments  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education  of  the  progress  of  stu-
dents’  performance  in  various  subject  areas,  including  science,  math,  engineering
and  technology  education,  have  concluded  that  the  grasp  of  science  and  math  by
U.S.  students  is  less  than  that  of  their  international  peers.  It  is  also  notable  that
over half of U.S. graduate students in science and math are foreign-born.

For  these  and  other  reasons,  the  implementation  of  the  recommendations  of  the
NSB  in  their  report  on  math  and  science  education  is  critical.  The  proposal  to  co-
ordinate and facilitate STEM programs through a National Council for STEM Edu-
cation  has  merit  and  should  be  supported  by  Congress.  Other  recommendations  to
focus attention on STEM education in federal agencies also have merit.

Civil  engineering  professionals,  however,  hold  the  final  responsibility  of  growing
the  pool  of  civil  engineers  and  civil  engineering  students  that  can  become  licensed
professional engineers. This needs to be a PR effort and a financial one by the con-
sultants and government employers to increase the salaries of young civil engineers.
The American Society of Civil Engineers can, and has in the past, play a major role
in  this  effort  and  in  working  with  Congress  to  improve  the  environment  for  young
people to enter the civil engineering profession.

Responses by Mark E. Bernhardt, Director, Facility Inspection, Burgess & Niple, Inc.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. You discuss your company’s involvement in the inspections of steel truss bridges
following  the  I–35W  collapse  in  your  testimony,  but  point  out  that  ‘‘in  general,
the  inspections  were  carried  out  in  the  same  manner  as  those  completed  prior
to  the  I–35  collapse.’’  In  your  opinion,  what  was  the  value  of  these  new  inspec-
tions?  What  sort  of  guidance  or  technical  assistance  could  FHWA  provide  to
make these inspections more valuable? Did the re-inspection alert you to any new
problems, and how did you or the relevant state DOT deal with those problems?
A1. The primary value of the supplemental deck truss inspections performed in the
aftermath of the I–35W collapse was to help in reassuring the American public that
bridges  are  indeed  safe.  Since  it  has  not  yet  been  determined  what  caused  the  I–
35W  bridge  collapse;  i.e.,  latent  design  defect,  construction  overload,  ongoing  dete-
rioration  of  primary  bridge  members,  etc.,  it  would  be  premature  to  redefine  NBIS
procedures  at  this  time.  It  may  turn  out  that  the  collapse  is  not  something  that
could have been prevented by enhanced bridge inspection practices. Once the cause
has been determined, the FHWA, along with the bridge engineering community, will
be able to determine if modifications to inspection procedures are indeed warranted.
The  re-inspections  of  deck  truss  bridges  performed  by  Burgess  &  Niple  found  no
new  significant  deficiencies  that  required  immediate  repairs.  All  findings  were
transmitted  immediately  to  the  appropriate  state  transportation  agency  personnel.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. In  your  testimony,  you  note  that,  ‘‘simply  collecting  more  data  and  providing
more frequent inspections will not improve overall bridge safety’’ and that even-
tually  bridges  must  be  rehabilitated  or  replaced.  The  age  distribution  for  all
U.S. bridges is remarkably flat, however. Twenty-five percent are under 20 years
old.  Over  half  the  bridges  in  the  U.S.  are  under  40  years  old,  and  over  eighty
percent  are  under  55  years  old.  How  much  do  we  know  now  about  the  rates  of
deterioration for bridges and how those rates change over time? Are we confident
that  current  levels  of  investment  for  bridge  replacement  will  not  keep  up  with
rehabilitation needs?

A1. Many  studies  have  been  done  with  respect  to  methods  by  which  to  accurately
model  bridge  deterioration.  In  one  accepted  approach  the  condition  of  a  bridge  or
an element of a bridge is characterized in terms of a set of possible condition states.
The  deterioration  of  that  element  is  represented  as  the  successive  occurrence  of
transitions  from  one  state  to  another.  The  likelihood  of  these  transitions  occurring
during a certain time period is dependent on such factors as loading conditions, en-
vironmental  effects,  levels  of  maintenance  and  repair,  etc.  Markov  process  assump-
tions  are  used  to  estimate  transition  probabilities  from  one  condition  state  to  the
next  with  a  key  assumption  being  that  transition  probabilities  are  independent  of
the  element’s  previous  states.  Another  common  approach  uses  statistical  regression
to  develop  relationships  between  condition  measures  and  parameters  presumed  to
have  a  causal  influence  on  condition.  More  knowledge  of  the  physical  and  chemical
deterioration mechanisms and further detailed study of bridge behavior would likely
improve  the  accuracy  of  these  deterioration  models.  Although,  the  issue  is  not  that
we do not know now when repairs should be made, it is that transportation agencies
lack  the  funding  necessary  to  repair  and  maintain  their  bridge  inventories  to  the
desired condition standard.

ASCE’s  Report  Card  for  America’s  Infrastructure  from  2005  concluded  that  $9.4
billion per year over the next 20 years is needed to eliminate bridge deficiencies and
an  additional  $7.3  billion  annually  is  needed  to  prevent  the  bridge  deficiency  back-
log from increasing further.
Q2. In your testimony you describe a ‘‘general consensus within the engineering com-
munity  that  visual  inspection  practices  must  be  supported  by  rigorous  training,
certification,  and  quality  assurance  programs.’’  In  your  opinion,  how  does  the
current  training  regime  offered  by  the  National  Highway  Institute  stack  up  in
these areas?

A2. The  FHWA/NHI  Bridge  Inspection  Training  Program,  namely  the  three-week
comprehensive training, is designed to bring individuals with at least a high school
diploma  to  entry  level  participation  in  bridge  inspection  related  work,  notably  field

inspection  activities.  However,  in  23  CFR  650  Sub  Part  C  National  Bridge  Inspec-
tion  Standards,  sections  650.309  Qualifications  of  Personnel,  only  three  classifica-
tions  of  bridge  inspection  staff,  ‘‘Program  Manager,’’  ‘‘Team  Leader,’’  and  ‘‘Under-
water  Bridge  Inspection  Diver,’’  have  minimum  qualification  requirements.  Each  of
these  classifications  uses  the  comprehensive  training  as  a  baseline  for  qualification
but  none  of  them  are  entry  level  positions.  The  current  minimum  specifications  in
the  NBIS  for  training  and  qualifications  for  Program  Managers  and  Team  Leaders
are  somewhat  sound,  however  clear  statements  should  be  added  that  address  the
following recommended improvements:

• The  current  Team  Leader  classification  title  should  be  modified  to  Team
Leader I. The minimum qualifications in NBIS for this classification are ade-
quate  for  bridge  structures  that  are  not  deemed  complex  and  for  structures
that are not already classified as structurally deficient.

• A new classification for ‘‘Team Leader II’’ should be introduced for structures
deemed complex and for structures that are already classified as structurally
deficient.  Minimum  qualifications  for  this  classification  should  include:  A  BS
in  engineering  from  an  ABET  accredited  institution,  passing  of  the  Fun-
damentals  of  Engineering  exam,  at  least  two  years  experience  with  bridge
safety inspections and completion of FHWA comprehensive training.

• Engineering  judgment  is  frequently  required  to  assign  condition  ratings  to
important  structural  components  of  a  bridge.  Since  the  PE  in  responsible
charge  may  not  personally  inspect  all  items  at  arm’s  length,  he  or  she  must
be  able  to  rely  on  a  person  with  sufficient  understanding  of  structural  sys-
tems  to  assist  in  the  assignment  of  condition  ratings  to  structural  compo-
nents. The Team Leader I and Team Leader II concept support this.
• State  agencies  across  the  United  States  have  the  ability  to  utilize  personnel
other  than  licensed  Professional  Engineers  to  inspect  bridge  structures.  This
is  being  done  primarily  because  the  National  Bridge  Inspection  Standards
(NBIS)  allows  experience  to  substitute  for  a  professional  engineering  license.
Under  NBIS  guidelines,  a  person  without  any  formal  educational  training  in
structural  engineering  can  be  a  Program  Manager  or  Team  Leader  with  ten
and  five  years  experience,  respectively.  This  should  be  changed  to  mandate
professional  licensing  in  addition  to  accumulated  relevant  experience  for  the
Program  Manager  position.  The  proposed  Team  Leader  II  classification  ad-
dresses this issue with team leaders.
• Alternate  specifications  for  comprehensive  bridge  inspection  training  for  li-
censed engineers and persons with a secondary education that includes bridge
engineering.
• There  should  be  a  correlation  between  complexity  of  structure,  and  level  of
training and experience. The Team Leader I and Team Leader II concept sup-
port this.

• Improvements can also be made to the certification process. See below.

Many State DOTs already have some form of bridge inspector certification process
in  place  to  support  qualification  requirements.  They  review  individual’s  experience
and  qualifications  and  issue  a  unique  CBI  (Certified  Bridge  Inspector)  Number  to
qualified  inspectors  (Florida  and  Oregon  are  examples).  States  that  do  not  have  a
formal process often request certificates of NHI training and PE licensure from con-
sultants  that  they  hire  to  perform  inspection  work  as  a  way  to  verify  credentials.
Also,  in  many  states,  consultants  need  to  be  ‘‘pre-certified’’  for  bridge  inspection

work, just like any other engineering service, prior to submitting on contracts.

Greater  accountability  demands  a  higher  level  of  competency  and  this  can  be
achieved through a certification process that incorporates rigorous testing. The cur-
rent FHWA/NHI training program provides the information necessary for competent
performance.  However  the  testing  in  place  primarily  evaluates  learning  to  satisfy
IACET  requirements  for  continuing  education  eligibility.  For  the  proposed  entry
level  ‘‘Bridge  Inspector’’  and  the  proposed  ‘‘Team  Leader  I,’’  this  is  adequate;  how-
ever for the proposed ‘‘Team Leader II’’ classification, it is not.

The introduction of a Federal Certification process would normalize skill levels of
personnel  performing  bridge  inspections  nationwide  and  should  include  the  fol-
lowing:

• Definition of inspector classifications based on skill levels (i.e., Bridge Inspec-
tor—1,  Bridge  Inspector  —2,  Team  Leader  I,  Team  Leader  II,  Bridge  Inspec-
tion Diver, Program Manager).

• Documentation of background education.

The  NHI  has  the  ability  to  track  and  maintain  inspector  certification  on  a  na-
tional basis. State agencies could build on a federal certification process for specific
needs and applications within their state.
Q3. One method to push new promising technologies has been to widely disseminate
results  from  specific  demonstrations.  Are  individual  demonstration  projects  suf-
ficient  to  jump-start  a  transportation  technology,  given  the  risk  aversion  and
conservative nature of the civil engineering profession?

A3. Demonstration  projects  provide  the  hard  data  that  can  demonstrate  the  viabil-
ity  of  emerging  technologies  and  weed  out  those  that  do  not  provide  useful  results.
Many of the newer technologies have higher initial costs than traditional visual in-
spection  techniques,  but  are  likely  to  result  in  more  cost-effective  bridge  manage-
ment  over  the  life  of  a  structure.  Engineers  are  probably  reluctant  to  adopt  tech-
nologies  if  they  are  skeptical  of  the  long-term  cost  benefits.  Proposed  projects  such
as the FHWA’s Long-Term Bridge Performance Program will be structured to gather
the data necessary to answer questions related to the actual cost benefits of emerg-
ing bridge testing and monitoring technologies.
Q4. Mr.  Bernhardt,  you  note  in  your  testimony  that  a  FHWA  study  in  2001  deter-
mined that less than eight percent of inspectors could successfully locate certain
defects  in  test  bridges.  How  confident  are  you  in  the  current  inspection  regime’s
ability  to  consistently  identify  potential  safety  hazards?  How  confident  are  you
that they identify needed repairs before they become major reconstruction?

A4. If  an  inspector  is  properly  trained  and  certified;  is  focused  on  the  job  at  hand;
understands the responsibility associated with bridge inspection; has had the oppor-
tunity  to  gain  experience  while  working  under  the  direction  of  more  senior  bridge
inspectors;  is  comfortable  working  within  a  particular  bridge’s  environment;  has
adequate time allotted and equipment provided to permit the inspector to get within
arm’s length of all critical members; has at least a basic understanding of structural
mechanicals;  and  established  quality  control  and  quality  assurance  procedures  are
followed, potential safety hazards, structure deficiencies, and needed repairs can be
successfully identified.

STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER C. HIGGINS

OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING

I  thank  the  Committee  for  the  opportunity  to  provide  this  written  testimony  on
research needs and actions necessary to help ensure the safety of the Nation’s exist-
ing bridge inventory. On-going research at Oregon State University, funded through
the Oregon Department of Transportation, has focused on field and laboratory test-
ing, nondestructive evaluation, analysis, rating, and evaluation of existing aging and
deteriorated  bridges.  We  are  also  applying  high-performance  materials  and  tech-
niques  for  repair  and  strengthening  of  existing  bridges  as  well  as  developing  tools
to  more  directly  quantify  risks  associated  with  operational  conditions  thereby  ena-
bling  better  informed  bridge  management  decisions.  This  testimony  reflects  these
experiences  and  addresses  some  of  the  current  limitations  in  understanding  aging
and deteriorated bridges and highlights some of the pressing research needs.

Bridges are a unique type of structure that must withstand a wide array of forces
including  wind,  earthquakes,  floods,  impacts,  and  traffic  loads,  among  others.  Fur-
ther,  they  are  exposed  to  variable  seasonal  climatic  conditions  and  millions  of  re-
peated  cycles  of  load  with  magnitude  and  volume  that  have  continued  to  increase
over  time.  These  combined  influences  can  result  in  strength  deterioration  of  the
bridge  members  and  connections  and  without  sufficient  inspection,  maintenance,
and  intervention  can  result  in  collapse.  Engineers  have  little  information  on  the
combined  influences  of  applied  structural  loading  with  variable  environmental  con-
ditions  such  as  freeze-thaw,  chloride  exposure,  and  extreme  seasonal  temperature
changes.  Some  of  the  new  materials  being  developed  for  bridge  strengthening  rely
on  bonding  to  the  bridge  surfaces  that  may  be  more  susceptible  to  environmental
factors.  Significant  additional  research  on  large-sized  bridge  members  under  com-
bined  structural  and  environmental  loading  are  required  to  ensure  performance  of
new strengthening techniques and materials.

We must better address the large number of aging bridges that remain in the na-
tional  inventory.  These  aging  bridges  contain  materials  and  structural  details  that
are very different from our modern design and construction practice. Better quanti-
fying  the  safety  of  these  bridges  is  a  national  need.  Engineers  commonly  apply  de-
sign and rating tools developed for new bridges to older bridges often without suffi-
cient data to know if these are applicable. As an example, engineers are now rating
some  bridges  for  strength  (collapse  state)  that  were  designed  by  an  older  method
called  working  stress  design  (service  level  state).  We  cannot  now  be  certain  how
some of these older designs will perform at the strength condition. There is a signifi-
cant  research  need  to  better  quantify  the  actual  strength  of  older  bridges  that  will
remain  in  the  national  bridge  inventory.  An  important  focus  should  be  on  in-situ
testing to failure of decommissioned bridges using realistic loading conditions. These
tests need to be supported with laboratory tests to make the best linkage with exist-
ing data. Research programs like this are very expensive, but can provide significant
savings if engineers can have confidence in the tools used to quantify remaining ca-
pacity of existing bridges and preclude unnecessary replacement or restrictions.

Bridges  often  sustain  damage  and  deterioration  over  time.  The  most  significant
contributor  to  deterioration  is  corrosion.  Current  data  available  to  evaluate  corro-
sion damaged bridge members is exceedingly limited and generally based on small-
sized laboratory specimens. This lack of data leads to great uncertainty in predicting
remaining  strength  and  ductility  of  corrosion  damaged  bridges.  Current  techniques
often  assign  crude  reduction  factors  based  on  subjective  visual  inspection  of  overall
condition. These factors have no scientific basis. Research is needed to develop tech-
niques  for  evaluation  of  corrosion  damaged  bridge  members.  This  research  must  be
on  large-size  samples  that  realistically  reflect  actual  bridge  members  and  the  com-
bined influences of applied fatigue loading with impressed corrosion need to be con-
sidered.  Additional  investment  in  laboratory  research  facilities  is  required  to  ade-
quately address this need.

Advancement  generally  relies  on  more  sophisticated  techniques  and  physical  re-
sources  that  may  not  be  readily  available  within  a  transportation  agency  or
consultancy. These include more complicated analytical and computational methods
(nonlinear  models,  probabilistic  methods,  etc.),  as  well  software  and  hardware  re-
sources  such  as  finite  element  software  and  computing  power.  Having  knowledge-
able in-house technical staff that can understand and fairly evaluate advancements
are critical for research adoption/adaptation. We need to be able to educate the next
generation  of  engineers  that  can  supply  this  technical  competence  and  can  better
handle  the  probabilistic  nature  of  the  problems  we  encounter,  can  understand  and
apply  the  more  sophisticated  analytical  techniques  being  developed,  and  can  effec-
tively communicate with public stakeholders and inform public policy.

Additional  research  funding  or  reallocation  of  existing  resources  between  ‘‘re-
search’’  and  ‘‘planning,’’  as  well  as  a  greater  focus  on  bridge  infrastructure  by  Uni-
versity  Transportation  Centers  is  needed.  A  national  research  center  focused  on
safety  evaluation  of  existing  bridges  that  draws  on  expertise  from  across  the  coun-
try, as in the framework of the National Science Foundation’s Earthquake Engineer-
ing  Research  Center  program,  would  be  a  logical  and  fruitful  outcome.  There  is
much research to be done to enhance our understanding of bridge deterioration and
our  ability  to  evaluate  the  safety  of  existing  bridge  members,  connections,  and  sys-
tems. We need to develop new techniques for evaluation of bridge infrastructure de-
terioration, develop health monitoring and effective strengthening/rehabilitation ap-
proaches,  consider  more  directly  safety  and  risk  (specifically  quantify  risks)  for
bridges  and  operating  conditions,  and  indeed  look  at  system  level  performance  to
facilitate ideal resource allocation. With such compelling research outcomes it is pos-
sible  to  transform  the  state-of-the-art  to  protect  the  safety  of  the  Nation’s  bridges.

STATEMENT OF
MICHAEL TODD

ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA–SAN DIEGO

AND

CHARLES FARRAR

LEADER, THE ENGINEERING INSTITUTE
LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY

First  we  wish  to  sincerely  thank  the  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  for
holding  this  hearing,  and  for  the  opportunity  to  present  this  supplemental  written
testimony. We hope to add a perspective that complements the very informative dis-
cussions provided during the live testimony by representatives of FHWA, AASHTO,
ASCE, and ACEC. It is encouraging that the Committee has taken up the very im-
portant  issue  of  infrastructure  (and  specifically,  bridge)  condition  and  safety.  Our
nation’s infrastructure safety has direct impact upon our country’s economy and se-
curity,  and  we  agree  that  there  is  no  better  time  than  the  present  to  investigate
the current state of infrastructure damage assessment technology to determine both
what is being done and what could be done for future improvements. While the en-
gineering  community  of  bridge  experts  does  not  yet  know  what  led  to  the  recent  I–
35  bridge  collapse  in  Minneapolis,  this  disaster  nonetheless  unfortunately  brought
to popular consciousness the dramatic consequences of such a structural failure.

By  way  of  introduction,  we  are  mechanical  (Michael  Todd)  and  civil  (Charles
Farrar)  engineers  who  currently  co-lead  the  Engineering  Institute  (http://
www.lanl.gov/projects/ei/index.shtml),  a  joint  research  and  educational  collabora-
tion  between  the  University  of  California–San  Diego  Jacobs  School  of  Engineering
and  the  Los  Alamos  National  Laboratory  that  focuses  upon  the  fields  of  structural
health  monitoring  and  damage  prognosis.  Prior  to  joining  the  University  of  Cali-
fornia  San  Diego,  Prof.  Todd  had  a  seven-year  career  in  leading  DOD  research  and
development  programs  at  the  U.S.  Naval  Research  Laboratory,  and  Dr.  Farrar  has
spent 25 years in numerous forms of technology development, transition, and leader-
ship  at  Los  Alamos  National  Laboratory.  Prof.  Todd  and  Dr.  Farrar  together  have
23  years  experience  in  the  structural  health  monitoring  and  damage  prognosis
fields.

The process of implementing a damage detection strategy for aerospace, civil and
mechanical engineering infrastructure is referred to as structural health monitoring
(SHM).  This  process  involves  the  observation  of  a  structure  or  mechanical  system
over  time  using  periodically  spaced  dynamics  response  measurements,  the  extrac-
tion of damage-sensitive features from these measurements, and the statistical anal-
ysis of these features to determine the current state of system health. For long-term
SHM,  the  output  of  this  process  is  periodically  updated  information  regarding  the
ability  of  the  structure  to  continue  to  perform  its  intended  function  in  light  of  the
inevitable  aging  and  degradation  resulting  from  its  operational  environments.
Under  an  extreme  event,  such  as  an  earthquake  or  unanticipated  blast  loading,
SHM  is  used  for  rapid  condition  screening.  This  screening  is  intended  to  provide,
in  near  real  time,  reliable  information  about  system  performance  during  such  ex-
treme  events  and  the  subsequent  integrity  of  the  system.  Damage  prognosis  (DP)
extends  the  SHM  process  by  considering  how  such  an  assessment,  when  combined
with  a  probabilistic  model  of  future  environmental  and  operational  loading  condi-
tions  can  be  used  to  forecast  metrics  of  system  performance  useful  to  the  owners,
such  as  remaining  system  life  and  maintenance  scheduling.  The  Engineering  Insti-
tute  is  the  only  university/national  laboratory  collaboration,  to  the  best  of  our
knowledge,  in  the  United  States  that  is  promoting  a  focused  research-driven  grad-
uate  education  in  the  SHM  and  DP  fields,  leading  to  next-generation  engineers
trained  in  critical  inter-disciplinary  skills  required  to  solve  the  complex  SHM/DP
problems  associated  with  long-term  infrastructure  life  cycle  engineering  and  man-
agement.

This  testimony  will  pose  five  questions  for  consideration  by  the  Committee.  We
believe  that  these  are  among  the  important  questions  that  both  the  engineering/
technical  community  and  the  policy-makers  should  be  addressing  as  we  jointly  as-
sess how the SHM/DP fields are being applied or could be applied to infrastructure
condition monitoring and remediation.

infrastructure such as bridges?

In  1992,  an  extensive  survey  of  bridge  failures  in  the  United  States  since  1950
was  presented  by  Shirole  and  Holt.1 These  authors  point  out  that  at  that  time  the
responses of engineers to bridge failures was reactive as is the case with most unan-
ticipated failures of engineered systems. Bridge design modifications and inspection
program changes were made in response to catastrophic failures. The collapse of the
Tacoma  Narrows  Bridge  more  than  a  half  century  ago  is  a  classic  example  of  this
reactive approach because it led to the inspection and design modifications of other
suspension  bridges.  The  widespread  introduction  of  the  current  federally  mandated
systematic  bridge  inspection  program  was  directly  attributed  to  the  catastrophic
bridge collapse at Point Pleasant, WV, in 1967.2 Design modifications for seismic re-
sponse  of  bridges  have  been  made  as  a  direct  consequence  of  damage  sustained  by
these structures during the 1971 San Fernando Earthquake (Gates, 1976).3 Damage
leading to bridge collapse also occurs as a result of collisions and scour (the process
where  increased  fluid  velocity  usually  associated  with  a  flood  removes  supporting
soil  from  the  base  of  a  bridge  pier).  For  example,  the  AMTRAK  railroad  bridge  col-
lapse near Mobile, Alabama, in 1993 resulted from the collision of a barge with the
bridge pier.

At present, bridges are required to be rated and monitored during biennial inspec-
tions,  largely  with  the  use  of  visual  inspection  techniques.  As  needed,  these  visual
inspections  are  augmented  with  traditional  local  nondestructive  evaluation  (NDE)
techniques. However, because these NDE techniques inspect only a very small area
of  the  structure,  they  require  some  a  priori  knowledge  of  the  possible  damage  loca-
tion before they can be used effectively. These techniques are not employed in a con-
tinuous manner and, in general, they require that the portion of the structure being
inspected  is  readily  accessible.  There  is  the  possibility  that  damage  can  go  unde-
tected  during  the  visual  inspections  or  that  damage  in  load-carrying  members  can
grow  to  critical  levels  between  inspection  intervals  as  the  recent  collapse  of  the  I–
35 Bridge in Minneapolis has made all too clear.

In an effort to move from the current qualitative visual assessments to more con-
tinuous and more quantified structural health monitoring procedures, the civil engi-
neering community has studied global vibration-based damage assessment of bridge
structures since the early 1980’s. The fundamental premise of these methods is that
the measured vibration response of the bridge is a function of the mass and stiffness
properties of that structure. Damage will alter the stiffness properties of the bridge
and  these  changes  will  be  detected  in  the  measured  vibration  response.  To  date,
these  methods,  which  make  use  of  off-the-shelf  sensing  technology,  have  only  been
shown to be effective after significant damage had been sustained by the structure.
These  damage  levels  are  well  beyond  those  that  would  be  considered  necessary  to
safely  shut  the  structure  down  before  catastrophic  failure.  In  addition,  environ-
mental  and  operating  condition  variability  as  well  as  the  physical  size  of  these
structures has presented significant challenges to the implementation of such bridge
monitoring  approaches.  Although  numerous  studies  focused  on  the  development  of
more  advanced  structural  health  monitoring  approaches  have  been  undertaken,
none have been shown to be more effective than the current biannual visual inspec-
tion techniques currently in use by state highway departments.
(2) What  new  technologies  are  under  development  that  could  aid  in  infra-

structure SHM/DP health management strategies?

SHM/DP  technologies  can  roughly  be  categorized  into  sensing/networking,  which
is the way various data are obtained from the structure and managed through net-
works of sensors and possibly actuators, and data interrogation, which are the algo-
rithms  used  to  extract  meaningful  damage-related  information  from  the  data  and
then use that information to form robust assessments about the structure’s current
health  state.  Stated  succinctly,  SHM/DP  has  been  enabled  by  the  revolution  in
microelectronics  over  the  past  few  decades.  These  advances  are  making  more  ubiq-
uitous sensing on large-scale structures economically feasible. Systems with greater
sensor  density  include  traditional  wired  sensor  networks  and  more  recently,  new
wireless  sensor  networking  paradigms.  Wireless  sensor  networks  can  potentially
better address the need for more continuous monitoring in the field, where the tra-
ditional  design  of  wired  sensors  connecting  to  a  centralized  data  acquisition  and
storage hub is not always practical. Many bridges or other infrastructure simply do

not have a convenient AC power supply to which one can ‘‘plug in’’ their sensor net-
work. Decentralized sensor network architectures rooted in wireless sensing and te-
lemetry  can  address  this  issue  by  providing  local  sensing  ‘‘nodes’’  where  sensing,
control,  computing,  and  telemetry  are  all  integrated  in  relatively  low-power  plat-
forms.  These  platforms  can  communicate  with  each  other  as  needed  to  move  infor-
mation through the network using an energy efficient ‘‘hopping’’ protocol where data
are  transmitted  from  node  to  node  and  eventually  to  a  base  station.  While  many
researchers have advanced (and continue to advance) such wireless sensor nodes in
the  last  10  years  (e.g.,  see  the  work  by  Lynch,  et  al.4 ),  these  nodes  still  have  some
limitations  in  bandwidth  (how  much  data  or  information  can  move  around  the  net-
work  in  time),  local  data  storage  (how  much  data  or  information  can  reside  on  the
node  during  local  processing),  and  what  types  of  specific  sensors  can  interface  with
them.  These  limitations  are  all  related  to  the  availability  of  power.  Currently,  the
majority of these sensor nodes use batteries as the local power source. Although the
nodes  are  designed  to  be  extremely  power  efficient,  the  batteries  represent  a  lim-
ited-life component that has to be periodically replaced. For large bridge structures,
the  locations  where  one  might  need  such  a  sensor  node  can  make  it  very  costly  to
replace  the  batteries  and  can  pose  a  safety  concern  for  the  technician  who  has  to
perform this duty.

Consequently,  researchers  are  also  currently  investigating  strategies  that  employ
energy  harvesting  or  an  alternate  ‘‘on  demand’’  energy  delivery  system  that  makes
use  of  power  supplied  by  autonomous  vehicles  such  as  small  robotic  helicopters  or
cars.5 The  Engineering  Institute  team  recently  demonstrated  such  a  system  for  the
first  time  on  an  out-of-service  bridge  near  Truth-or-Consequences,  New  Mexico.6,7
Here  the  term  ‘‘energy  harvesting’’  refers  to  the  process  of  converting  ambient  en-
ergy  sources  available  in  the  bridge’s  operating  environment  to  useful  electric  en-
ergy. Available energy sources include solar and the bridge’s own mechanical vibra-
tion  energy  from  traffic  loading.  Small  commercially  available  off-the-shelf  solar
cells are readily available to power these sensor nodes. Mechanical energy typically
is  transformed  into  electric  energy  by  actuating  a  piezoelectric  material  that  pro-
duces an electrical charge when strained.

From  the  sensing  perspective  another  area  of  emerging  technology  is  the  use  of
active sensing technology. Most earlier work on structural-health monitoring strate-
gies  for  civil  engineering  infrastructure  relied  on  the  ambient  loading  environment
as  an  excitation  source  and,  hence,  are  referred  to  as  passive  sensing  systems.  The
difficulty with using such excitation sources is that they are often variable and dis-
tributed  over  a  wide  area  of  the  structure  making  these  inputs  almost  impossible
to measure. The variable nature of these signals requires robust data normalization
procedures  to  be  employed  in  an  effort  to  determine  that  the  change  in  the  meas-
ured  data  is  the  result  of  damage  as  opposed  to  changing  operational  and  environ-
mental  conditions.  Also,  there  is  no  control  over  the  excitation  source,  and  it  may
not  excite  the  type  of  system  response  useful  for  identifying  damage  at  an  early
stage.  As  an  alternative,  a  sensing  system  can  be  designed  to  provide  a  local  exci-
tation  tailored  to  the  damage  detection  process.  Piezoelectric  materials  are  being
used for such active sensing systems. Because these materials produce an electrical
charge when deformed, they can be used as dynamic strain gauges. Conversely, the
same  materials  can  also  be  used  as  actuators  because  a  mechanical  strain  is  pro-
duced when an electrical field is applied to the patch. This material can exert small
predefined  excitation  forces  into  the  structure  on  a  local  level.  The  use  of  a  known
and repeatable input makes it much easier to process the measured response signal
for  damage  detection.  For  instance,  by  exciting  the  structure  in  an  ultrasonic  fre-
quency  range,  the  sensing  system  can  focus  on  monitoring  changes  of  structural
properties with minimum interference from variability in traffic loading, which tend
to be low-frequency in nature. Faculty and staff from the LANL/UCSD Engineering
Institute  (Prof.  Lanza  di  Scalea  and  Dr.  Gyuhae  Park,  as  well  as  the  authors)  are

among  a  small  group  of  researchers  in  the  U.S.  leading  the  development  of  these
active  sensing  approaches  for  civil  engineering  infrastructure  damage  assessment.
From the data interrogation approach, researchers have recognized that the dam-
age  detection  process  is  fundamentally  a  problem  in  statistical  pattern  recognition.
Basically, the damage detection process requires one to identify changes in the pat-
tern  of  the  sensor  readings  that  result  from  damage.  Therefore,  the  extensive  sets
of  machine  learning  and  pattern  recognition  tools  developed  for  applications  such  a
speech pattern recognition and credit card fraud detection are also directly applica-
ble  to  the  damage  detection  problem.  The  adaptation  and  further  development  of
such algorithms for the data interrogation part of the damage detection process has
been pioneered by researchers at the Engineering Institute (Prof. Hoon Sohn of the
Korean  Advanced  Institute  of  Science  and  Technology  while  a  staff  member  at  Los
Alamos) working in conjunction with faculty from the University of Sheffield in the
U.K.  (Prof.  Keith  Worden).  Such  algorithms  are  now  being  embedded  on  the  micro-
processors  that  are  integrated  into  the  wireless  sensing  nodes  in  an  effort  to  dis-
tribute the damage assessment process to the individual sensor nodes. The combina-
tion of this more ubiquitous sensing along with more robust data interrogation algo-
rithms  is  giving  engineers  the  hope  that  in  the  not  too  distant  future  continuous
monitoring  of  damage  initiation  and  accumulation  in  civil  infrastructure  will  one
day be a reality.
(3) What  are  the  barriers  to  transitioning  SHM/DP  technologies  from  re-

search to practice?

Other  than  in  a  very  few  areas  such  as  the  rotating  machinery  industry,  SHM/
DP  technologies  are  still  largely  confined  to  laboratory  demonstrations  and  not  to
industrial practice, despite the fact that SHM/DP technology traces its modern roots
to the 1970s and 1980s, when the offshore oil, civil engineering, and aerospace com-
munities  first  began  exploring  it.  These  technologies  grew  out  of  the  more  mature
field of nondestructive evaluation and inspection, and it was motivated by engineers’
desire  to  detect  damage  in  an  online  manner  (i.e.,  while  the  structure  is  in  oper-
ational service) on a more global scale. There are several reasons why SHM/DP has
not  made  the  transition  from  research  to  practice,  some  technical  and  others  not.
One  of  the  primary  technical  difficulties  in  shaping  an  SHM/DP  strategy  for  some-
thing as complex as a bridge is the wide range of length and time scales over which
different forms of damage can initiate and proceed. Fatigue cracking or stress corro-
sion  cracking  initiates  on  a  very  small  (micrometer-level)  length  scale  that  is  most
probably  detected  only  by  a  nondestructive  inspection  technique  like  ultrasonic  in-
spection, which is very difficult to implement in an online, cost-efficient manner for
large-scale  structures.  Also,  depending  upon  loading  and  environmental  conditions,
cracks  grow  on  both  very  slow  (initially;  measured  over  months  or  years  in  many
cases) and very fast (near failure; measured over seconds) time scales. Furthermore,
complex structures such as bridges can have a great diversity of degradation mecha-
nisms (e.g., steel fatigue, concrete cracking, scour of soil around bridge piers, corro-
sion)  that  may  all  be  occurring  simultaneously,  each  on  its  own  length  and  time
scales. Such wide ranges in length and time demand very different sensing and data
interpretation  strategies,  all  of  which  make  any  sort  of  ‘‘one  size  fits  all’’  SHM/DP
strategy highly unlikely.

A  second  challenge  is  that  most  SHM/DP  technologies  are  being  developed  in  re-
search-oriented  environments  (such  as  a  university)  where  there  is  limited  ability
to  test  the  technologies  on  actual  full-scale  structures  in  the  field.  A  consequence
of  this  limitation  is  that  we  in  general  have  very  little  knowledge  about  the  long-
term  durability  of  sensing  networks  that  could  be  deployed  as  part  of  an  SHM/DP
strategy.  The  only  experience  with  long-term  sensor  system  deployment  and  moni-
toring  of  bridges  comes  from  the  relatively  few  bridges  that  are  instrumented  for
seismic  monitoring  as  part  of  the  California  Strong  Motion  Instrumentation  Pro-
gram.  These  arrays  have  provided  the  community  with  bridge  (and  other
infrastructural) response to earthquake ground motion, which has served to signifi-
cantly  advance  the  fields  of  seismic  retrofitting  and  new  design  paradigms.  How-
ever,  these  arrays  were  not  specifically  designed  or  deployed  for  damage  identifica-
tion  and  monitoring  studies.  In  addition,  there  are  very  few  out-of-service  bridges
still  standing  that  can  serve  as  test  beds  for  destructive  testing  on  which  research-
ers  can  validate  their  SHM/DP  strategies  under  realistic  operational  and  environ-
mental  scenarios.  However,  we  are  greatly  encouraged  by  the  FHWA’s  ‘‘Long-Term
Bridge  Performance  Program,’’  as  described  by  Dr.  Steven  Chase  in  a  keynote  lec-
ture at the 6tn International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring at Stanford
University, on September 11–13, 2007. This program plans to develop the necessary
long-term test beds needed to validate new SHM technology.

Moreover,  the  funding  levels  normally  accorded  such  researchers  is  not  sufficient
to  sustain  tests  long  enough  to  establish  true  proof-of-concept.  We  applaud  some  of
the  state  transportation  agencies  with  whom  we  or  our  immediate  colleagues  have
worked,  such  as  CALTRANS  and  the  New  Mexico  Department  of  Transportation,
for  their  forward-thinking  efforts  in  funding  and/or  facilitating  research  and  devel-
opment  in  SHM/DP  technologies  for  bridges.  Overall,  however,  the  funding  levels
that  are  typically  allocated  to  such  projects  are  well  short  of  what  is  required.  The
model  used  by  most  funding  agencies—the  single  Principal  Investigator  three-year
award—typically  amounts  to  between  $250,000  to  $300,000  total  funds  invested  in
the  complete  development,  testing,  and  validation  of  the  given  technology.  This
funding level is not sufficient to transition a proof-of-concept demonstration to a reli-
able,  field-deployable  system.  Moreover,  these  single-investigator  funding  levels  are
not  nearly  sufficient  to  integrate  the  many  components  required  by  the  multi-dis-
ciplinary nature of SHM/DP technology development.

As  we  alluded  previously,  there  are  non-technical  challenges  as  well.  Tradition-
ally,  many  universities  are  not  really  established  to  support  the  kinds  of  large
multi-disciplinary  efforts  required  to  bring  such  a  technology  to  bear.  Universities
generally  offer  relatively  narrowly-defined  degrees  (e.g.,  electrical  engineering,  me-
chanical  engineering,  etc.),  when  in  fact  the  person  optimally  trained  to  develop
SHM/DP  technologies  should  be  trained  in  aspects  of  many  such  degree  programs.
Additionally, universities also do not generally tend to encourage or reward the pro-
fessoriate for undertaking such projects. Promotion and tenure is typically based on
individual  merit,  not  the  success  of  teaming  arrangements,  particularly  for  junior
faculty  seeking  tenure.  Such  a  system  does  not  encourage  faculty  to  work  together
to  solve  complex  problems  or  develop  complex  technologies  that  demand  multi-dis-
ciplinary contributions. Clearly these are cultural issues that exist and must be ad-
dressed  at  the  university  level,  and  we  recognize  and  commend  the  Committee  for
its  efforts  to  promote  interdisciplinary  research,  particularly  via  the  National
Science  Foundation.  The  Engineering  Institute  has  attempted  to  tackle  some  of
these  barriers  by  offering  graduate  degrees  at  the  University  of  California  San
Diego that require course work in several departments and by funding graduate re-
search  projects  that  span  several  departments.  It  is  our  hope  that  such  efforts  will
be  replicated  on  a  broader  scale,  and  further  encourage  the  university  community
to  deconstruct  these  ’silo’  models  and  to  seek  partnering  opportunities  not  only
across departments but also with each other in order to meet the multi-disciplinary
needs of tomorrow’s technologist.
(4) How does the United States compare to other countries with respect to
implementing  SHM/DP  technologies  in  infrastructure  health  manage-
ment?

A number of Asian countries have taken an increasingly proactive approach to in-
frastructure  assessment  and  management.  The  Hong  Kong  (China)  government,
through  the  Highways  Department  of  Hong  Kong,  has  implemented  a  large-scale
monitoring  program  on  the  Tsing  Ma  suspension  bridge  (and  subsequently  on  an-
other  suspension  bridge  in  the  vicinity)  whereby  real-time  data  streams  of  bridge
vibration/deflection,  load,  cable  forces,  wind  speed,  temperature,  and  visual  camera
images  are  synthesized  in  a  master  control  center  from  which  bridge  management
decisions  regarding  traffic  patterns,  speed  regulations,  load  limits,  and  other  such
similar  performance  variables  are  continuously  updated.  Data  are  also  being  col-
lected for long-term research efforts to identify damage detection and tracking algo-
rithms  that  correlate  with  normal  visual  inspections  and  subsequent  maintenance
actions  so  that  SHM/DP  technologies  may  be  field-validated  over  long  times.  The
cost  of  this  system  has  been  reported  as  somewhere  between  $15–20  million.  Even
with this significant investment it is not clear that these researchers have a robust
damage  detection  strategy  in  place.  However,  by  allocating  the  resources  for  this
system and by making a long-term commitment to acquire and analyze the data ob-
tained, these researchers are better positioned to learn how to make accurate dam-
age assessments. This project is just one of many significant bridge monitoring sys-
tems being deployed in China that we have heard about at international conferences
on  structural  health  monitoring.  We  are  unaware  of  similar  bridge  monitoring
projects of this magnitude in the U.S.

In  Seoul,  Korea,  the  Seongsu  Bridge  collapsed  suddenly  in  1994  due  to  a  struc-
tural  failure,  killing  32  people.  As  a  result,  the  Korean  government  mandated  that
the infrastructure construction companies must provide monitoring systems for that
infrastructure.  Currently,  these  monitoring  systems  have  only  a  limited  number  of
sensors,  and  it  is  questionable  if  they  will  provide  the  necessary  local  information
needed to identify local damage at its onset.

We  are  also  aware  of  other  bridges  in  Thailand,  Singapore,  Taiwan,  and  Japan
that  have  installed  monitoring  systems.  Some  of  these  monitoring  systems  have
been  purchased  from  U.S.  companies  such  as  Kinemetrics,  Inc.  in  Pasadena,  CA.
However, to the best of our knowledge this company has not sold a system for moni-
toring a bridge in the U.S. Although there have been numerous large-scale SHM re-
search projects on bridges in Europe, we are not aware of any long-term instrumen-
tation  projects  in  Europe  that  are  as  extensive  as  the  ones  being  undertaken  in
Asia. There are companies in Europe such as VCE Holding in Vienna, Austria that
specialize  in  monitoring  civil  engineering  infrastructure.  It  was  recently  reported
that they have done measurements on over 1,100 bridges in Europe.8 To paraphrase
a  quote  from  a  recent  keynote  lecture  on  bridge  structural  health  monitoring  by  a
representative  of  this  company,  ‘‘Monitored  bridges  and  buildings  in  Europe  and
Asia  are  considered  intelligent  structures  while  monitored  bridges  and  buildings  in
the U.S. are considered suspect.’’
(5) What  are  elements  that  the  U.S.  Government  should  consider  as  it
crafts  an  investment  plan,  both  near-term  and  longer-term,  for  pro-
moting the development of SHM/DP technologies, and facilitating their
transition to practice for infrastructure health management?

We  begin  by  strongly  encouraging  the  government,  through  its  various  funding
agencies  such  as  the  National  Science  Foundation,  the  Federal  Highways  Adminis-
tration,  Defense  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency,  DOE,  and  the  various  DOD
research  offices,  to  substantially  increase  its  emphasis  on  investment  in  SHM/DP
technology  development  with  specific  attention  to  field  deployment  of  test  systems.
Even more importantly, the share of this investment earmarked for development of
basic  science  and  engineering  concepts,  where  the  time  to  maturity  is  in  the  5–10
year range, should be brought into balance with the much shorter time horizons as-
sociated with industrial times-to-market, typically 6–18 months. We believe the cur-
rent  funding  profile  that  heavily  weights  the  shorter  time  horizons  exacerbates  the
technical challenges presented above. That is, there is inadequate funding to do ex-
actly the kind of longer-term exploratory field deployments needed to transition the
SHM/DP  technology  into  practice.  These  short  industrial  times-to-market  certainly
have  their  place  in  infrastructure  health  management.  Through  SBIR  and  STTR
small  business  programs,  agencies  can  fund  small  studies  on  more  mature  tech-
nologies  (for  example,  a  new  kind  of  sensor  already  prototyped)  where  proof-of-con-
cept  requirements  are  in  line  with  these  short  industry  time  scales  and  can  solve
certain specific problems already identified.

We believe that a sound renewed commitment to investing in fundamental science
and  engineering,  particularly  where  multiple  disciplines  are  integrated  to  solve
problems  at  the  systems  level,  can  ensure  a  strong,  balanced  research  investment
portfolio  that  optimizes  the  return  on  that  investment.  The  Committee  has  led  by
example  on  this  front,  setting  forth  an  aggressive  vision  for  a  ten-year  doubling  of
the  NSF  budget.  Particularly  given  such  an  appropriate  infusion  of  resources,  fed-
eral funding agencies can easily be tasked with such a mission and put into a posi-
tion  of  being  encouraged  and  rewarded  for  cooperating  to  pool  resources  as  nec-
essary  in  the  short-term  in  order  to  promote  these  multi-disciplinary  field  deploy-
ments.

We  urge  that  the  engineering/technical  community  work  proactively  with  policy-
makers  to  develop,  fund,  and  execute  a  comprehensive  research,  development,  and
transition  plan  that  engages  all  technology  developers  with  a  reasonable  balance  of
academic, industry, national laboratories and government partners.

More  specifically,  we  would  like  to  reiterate  our  support  of  the  FHWA’s  Long-
Term  Bridge  Performance  Program.  Such  test  beds  are  absolutely  essential  to  the
further development, validation and field deployment of SHM technology as it is ap-
plied  to  bridge  monitoring.  We  further  recommend  that  funds  are  made  available
for  each  state  transportation  department  to  support  the  deployment  of  at  least  one
large-scale,  long-term  monitoring  system  on  a  bridge  that  is  of  most  concern.  This
funding  must  also  provide  for  long-term  management  and  analysis  of  the  data  ob-
tained  from  such  a  monitoring  system.  Ideally,  as  part  of  these  studies  the  more
advanced  structural  health  monitoring  concepts  will  be  directly  compared  to  tradi-
tional  inspection  techniques  over  a  long  period  of  time.  Such  comparisons  are  nec-
essary  to  validate  the  SHM  methods  and  to  show  that  these  methods  can  provide
a  higher  fidelity  of  damage  detection  and  quantification  than  the  current  visual  in-
spection methods.

We  recommend  that  policy-makers  consider  the  significant  amount  of  technology
components being developed at universities, national laboratories and industry that
are  directly  applicable  to  the  bridge  health  monitoring  problem.  However,  these
technologies  must  be  integrated  in  a  systematic  manner  to  best  address  the  SHM
problem  as  it  applies  to  bridge  structures  as  well  as  to  all  types  of  civilian  and  de-
fense infrastructure. When technologies from all these sources are integrated though
multi-disciplinary research teams such as the one formed by LANL and UCSD, solu-
tions  to  the  complex  problem  of  structural  health  monitoring  can  be  more  rapidly
advanced and deployed.

Finally,  although  this  document  has  emphasized  the  need  for  more  research
aimed  at  transitioning  SHM  technology  from  research  to  practice,  we  strongly  urge
policy-makers to continue to promote formal education innovation in this field. U.S.
universities  have  a  long  history  of  being  the  best  at  training  the  technical  special-
ists,  and  there  will  be  always  be  a  need  for  such  specialists.  However,  for  the  U.S.
to retain its technical advantage in the global economy, we must also be able to edu-
cate  a  new  generation  of  multi-disciplinary  engineers  that  can  integrate  diverse
technologies  to  solve  complex  problems  of  national  importance.  In  addition,  tech-
nology leaders of the future will also have to be much more multi-disciplinary than
in the past. A key aspect of The LANL/UCSD Engineering Institute is its proactive
efforts  to  develop  such  a  new  multi-disciplinary  degree  program  that  focuses  on
training the next generation of engineers in SHM/DP and on training the next gen-
eration  of  technology  leaders.  It  is  our  position  that  such  formal  multi-disciplinary
education  programs  (not  just  multi-disciplinary  research)  need  to  be  promoted  as  a
national educational priority.

Thank you again for this opportunity to submit testimony to the Committee, and
we hope that we can serve as a resource to the Committee as it considers these and
related  issues  of  critical  importance  to  our  nation’s  infrastructure.  The  faculty,  stu-
dents,  and  staff  of  the  LANL/UCSD  Engineering  Institute  looks  forward  to  contin-
ued  interactions  with  policy-makers,  Federal  and  State  Government  agencies,  and
private  industry  that  will  further  promote  and  deploy  SHM  technology  on  all  types
of aerospace, civil, and mechanical infrastructure.

STATEMENT OF LARRY W. FREVERT

PRESIDENT

AMERICAN PUBLIC WORKS ASSOCIATION

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  House  Committee  on  Science  &  Technology,
thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  submit  testimony  for  the  hearing,  Bridge  Safety:
Next Steps to Protect the Nation’s Critical Infrastructure. My name is Larry Frevert,
President  of  the  American  Public  Works  Association  (APWA).  I  submit  this  state-
ment  today  on  behalf  of  the  more  than  29,000  public  works  professionals  who  are
members of APWA, including our nearly 2,000 public agency members.

APWA  is  an  organization  dedicated  to  providing  public  works  infrastructure  and
services to millions of people in rural and urban communities, both small and large.
Working  in  the  public  interest,  our  members  design,  build,  operate  and  maintain
our vast transportation network, as well as other key infrastructure assets essential
to our nation’s economy and way of life.

We  join  with  others  in  expressing  our  deepest  sympathy  to  everyone  affected  by
the I–35W bridge collapse in Minneapolis on August 1. We remain saddened by this
tragedy and continue to extend our support to local, State and federal officials work-
ing on recovery and rebuilding.

The  tragic  failure  of  the  I–35W  bridge  is  a  stark  reminder  of  the  importance  of
public  infrastructure  to  the  daily  lives  of  all  people  and  to  the  welfare  and  safety
of  every  community.  But  this  essential  public  asset  is  aging  and  deteriorating.  It
is suffering the effects of chronic under-investment and is in critical need of funding
for maintenance, repair and improvement.

Our  nation’s  highway  bridges  are  no  exception.  The  average  span  currently  is
more  than  40  years  old.  More  than  one  in  every  four  is  rated  structurally  deficient
or  functionally  obsolete  and  in  need  of  repair,  improvement  or  replacement.  Of  the
more than 594,000 publicly-owned bridges on which we depend for personal mobility
and  movement  of  freight,  more  than  158,000  are  rated  deficient,  with  more  than
77,700 classified as structurally deficient and more than 80,600 as functionally obso-
lete.

Local  governments  own  in  excess  of  300,000  bridges,  more  than  half  of  publicly-
owned  bridges  in  the  U.S.  Of  the  total  local  inventory  nationwide,  29  percent  is
rated structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.

Standards  have  been  in  place  since  the  early  1970s  requiring  safety  inspections
every  two  years  for  all  bridges  greater  than  20  feet  in  length  on  all  public  roads.
Some  bridges  may  be  subject  to  more  frequent  inspections,  and  some  structures  in
very  good  condition  may  receive  an  exemption  from  the  two-year  cycle  and  be  in-
spected once every four years. These inspections, carried out by qualified inspectors,
collect data on the condition and composition of bridges.

Structurally  deficient  bridges  are  characterized  by  deteriorated  conditions  of  sig-
nificant  bridge  elements  and  reduced  load-carrying  capacity.  Functional  obsoles-
cence  results  from  changing  traffic  demands  on  the  structure  and  is  a  function  of
the geometrics of the bridge not meeting current design standards. Neither designa-
tion  indicates  a  bridge  is  unsafe.  But  they  do  indicate  a  need  for  repair,  improve-
ment or replacement.

We cannot ignore the under-investment in bridge maintenance, rehabilitation and
replacement. It is a major contributing factor undermining efforts to adequately ad-
dress  deficiencies.  Nationwide,  the  backlog  of  bridge  investment  needs  is  now  esti-
mated to total $65.2 billion.

As  a  nation,  we  are  failing  to  meet  the  needs  of  a  transportation  system  increas-
ingly  overburdened  by  rising  travel,  a  growing  population  and  more  freight.  Addi-
tional  traffic  volumes  and  heavier  loads  are  placing  ever  greater  stress  on  bridges
often designed for lighter loads. The U.S. Department of Transportation reports that
the funding backlog could be invested immediately in a cost-beneficial fashion to re-
place or otherwise address currently existing bridge deficiencies.

Local governments’ ability to fund necessary bridge improvements has eroded sig-
nificantly  over  the  years.  They  have  limited  financial  means  to  adequately  address
deficiencies  and  typically  do  not  have  the  capacity  to  do  major  repairs  or  capital
work on the magnitude of a bridge replacement without funding support.

Sharp increases in the costs of construction materials and supplies in the past few
years are compounding the funding challenge for local governments. In Washington
State  for  example,  escalating  material  and  supply  costs  and  one  of  the  largest  con-
struction programs in the Nation have had a severe impact on delivering local agen-
cy  projects.  It  is  not  unusual  to  take  10  years  or  more  from  the  time  funding  can
be secured and replacement done. And with the recent industry cost index increases,
the gap is growing and will continue to grow.

Immediate action to increase investment is crucial to accelerating local bridge re-
pair  and  replacement  programs.  Most  bridges  on  local  roads  were  either  built  to
older  standards  or  are  so  old  they  are  in  urgent  need  of  repair  or  replacement.  It
is not uncommon that bridges have gone for years, even decades, without the appro-
priate  action  to  repair  or  replace,  due  to  lack  of  funds.  This  is  particularly  true  in
more rural areas.

In many cases, locally-owned bridges were often designed to carry traffic volumes
and  loads  less  than  present  conditions  demand.  As  congestion  increases  on  the
Interstate  System  and  state  highways,  local  roads  become  diversion  routes,  sup-
porting  ever  increasing  levels  of  usage.  Freight  volumes,  too,  have  increased  faster
than general-purpose traffic, adding demands on all parts of the system. Automobile
technology  allowing  for  greater  speeds  has  made  many  bridge  geometrics  sub-
standard.

Deficient  bridges  are  rated,  prioritized  and  repaired  or  replaced  as  funding  is
available. When funding is insufficient, deferred maintenance, increased inspections,
weight limits and closures are often the only options.

APWA has been and will continue to be an advocate for the development of public
policies which ensure the safe and efficient management and operation of our public
infrastructure.  As  Congress  considers  the  needs  of  our  bridge  system,  we  urge  you
to consider the following recommendations.

APWA  supports  a  determined,  comprehensive  national  effort  to  increase  invest-
ment  to  eliminate  the  bridge  funding  backlog  needed  to  repair,  rehabilitate  and  re-
place  all  publicly  owned  bridges—including  local  bridges—as  part  of  a  zero  bridge
deficiencies goal. Such an effort, however, should not stop there. It needs sustained
and sustainable funding to ensure ongoing system preservation and maintenance at
a level necessary to prevent future deficiencies of all publicly-owned bridges.

APWA also supports updating bridge inspection standards and strengthening data
collection  and  reporting  procedures;  evaluating  active  bridge  monitoring  systems;
and strengthening inspector qualifications and training and inspection technologies,
research and procedures for all publicly-owned bridges, including those on our local
system.  We  believe  that  a  program  to  strengthen  research,  technology,  procedures
and standards must be supported by full federal funding necessary to carry out and
sustain it.

In conclusion, our nation’s bridge system is aging, deteriorating and suffering the
effects  of  decades  of  under-investment.  The  result  is  the  unacceptably  high  levels
of  deficiencies  we  see  today.  APWA  believes  that  working  together  in  partnership
with  local,  State,  federal  and  private  sector  partners,  we  can  and  must  take  imme-
diate  action  to  address  our  bridge  needs.  But  it  will  take  funding  and  leadership.
Increased investment to repair or replace deficient bridges is vital to achieve a safer
and  more  efficient  transportation  network.  A  strengthened  inspection  program  can
help  ensure  that  we  make  wise  investments  to  maintain  and  preserve  all  bridges.
Mr.  Chairman,  we  thank  you  for  holding  this  hearing  and  are  especially  grateful
to  you  and  Committee  Members  for  the  opportunity  to  submit  this  statement.
APWA  and  our  members  stand  ready  to  assist  you  and  the  Committee  as  we  move
forward to address our nation’s bridge needs.
