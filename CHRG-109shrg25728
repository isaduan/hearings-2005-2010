PORT  SECURITY 

TUESDAY,  MAY  17,  2005

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10  a.m.  in  room  SR–
253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Ted  Stevens,  Chairman 
of the Committee, presiding. 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS,

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Let  me  open  by  saying  this  hearing  was  at  the 
suggestion  of  Senator  Inouye,  and  we’re  trying  to  find  ways  to  im-
prove security and all modes of transportation. I’m pleased to have 
an opportunity to review these issues. 

Just  a  week  ago,  I  spent  the  major  part  of  the  day  at  the  Los 
Angeles  Port,  which  has  grown  so  large  that  it’s  hard  to  realize. 
Their  terminals  are  out  in  San  Bernardino  for  the  sort  of  freight 
that’s  coming  off  of  vessels,  and  they’re  building  three  railroads  to 
move that freight to those terminals, because of lack of space right 
in  the  area  of  the  port  itself,  so  that  means  that  the  security  in 
that  port  is  about  100  miles  wide.  We  have  an  enormous  problem 
with security. 

I  welcome  the  interest  of  my  great  friend  from  Hawaii.  Senator 

Inouye? 

STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE,

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

Senator  INOUYE.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  you  very  much.  I  have 
a  statement  here,  but  I’m  just  concerned  that,  when  we  speak  of 
security,  I  think  the  average  American  thinks  of  airports.  They 
don’t  realize  that  we  spend  less  than  10  percent  for  ports;  20  per-
cent  of  the  global  trade  is  maritime,  and,  of  that  amount,  we  have 
about 4 percent; but, whatever it is, our ports are always filled, and 
yet  I  don’t  think  that  our  security  there  is  sufficient,  just  like  our 
borders. 

But  I’d  like  to  know  what  we  should  be  doing.  The  Coast  Guard 
is  overwhelmed.  They’re  doing  a  great  job.  All  of  the  new  security 
agencies are trying their best, but their best may not be sufficient, 
so we’re here to listen, believe me, sir. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Let  me  say  that  we  have  a  series  of  votes  that 
are  going  to  start,  so  we  do  hope  that  the  witnesses  will  recognize 
that  timeframe  and  limit  their  statements  so  that  we  can  go 
through the list. We have a list of six people who are going to tes-

tify  between  now  and  11:10,  so  may  I  urge  the  witnesses—all  the 
statements  will  be  put  in  the  record  in  full;  if  we’re  going  to  have 
a  chance  to  ask  questions  and  to  get  your  responses  to  our  ques-
tions, we’ll have to limit the statements. 

Mr. Ruppersberger? 

STATEMENT OF HON. C.A. ‘‘DUTCH’’ RUPPERSBERGER,

U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM MARYLAND 

Mr.  RUPPERSBERGER.  Yes,  OK.  Well,  thank  you,  Chairman  Ste-
vens,  Co–Chairman  Inouye,  Members  of  the  Committee,  Senator 
Rockefeller, Senator Lautenberg. 

I’m honored to be here today to participate in this critical discus-
sion.  And  with  your  consent,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  prepared  a 
summary  of  my  complete  testimony  to  read  into  the  record  today, 
and  I  would  ask  that  my  entire  testimony  be  submitted  into  the 
record, as well. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  All  of  the  statements  that  have  been  submitted 

will be in the record, as well. 

Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Thank you. 
Now,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  my  main 
point  to  you  today  is  that  America’s  first-responders  should  not  be 
Congress’s second thought. Whether you call it port or maritime se-
curity,  each  of  us  understands  three  very  fundamental  principles: 
Number one, securing our Nation’s more than 359 sea, river, and 

land ports is a broad, varied, and complex goal. 

Number two, it is simply not possible, nor do I believe it is prac-
tical,  to  protect  all  of  our  ports  against  every  possible  threat.  The 
reality  of  limited  resources  and  over  95,000  miles  of  coastline 
means we must focus on good intelligence for credible threat infor-
mation and prioritize our spending accordingly. 

Number  three,  our  ports  are  absolutely  critical  to  our  Nation’s 
economic  security.  In  the  world  of  just-in-time  commerce  and  the 
global  marketplace,  our  ports  are  attractive  to  terrorists  to  either 
import  weapons  for  destruction  or  to  shut  down  the  global  supply 
chain and cripple our economy. Either possibility makes port secu-
rity a high priority for this Congress. 

The  best  example  of  this  was  in  the  fall  of  2002,  when  the  ship-
pers and dockers went on strike at the West Coast ports. That cost 
our United States economy $1 billion a day. 

Port security is broad and a complex issue, largely due to the re-
ality  that  ports  are  sprawling  commercial  hubs,  usually  centrally 
located  in  geographically  diverse  areas.  Our  working  ports  stretch 
across  coastlines,  riverways,  and  harbors,  moving  agricultural, 
mineral,  petroleum,  and  paper  products  to  connect  with  highways 
and  railways  for  transport.  Tons  of  goods  are  imported  and  ex-
ported  through  our  ports  every  day  in  bulk  in  containers  as  well 
as  roll-on/roll-off  vehicles.  Our  ports  are  also  home  to  some  of  our 
most  beloved  recreational  activities,  such  as  boating,  fishing,  and 
cruises,  all  of  which  contribute  to  our  economy  and  our  every  way 
of life. 

With so many distinguished experts in port security following me 
on  the  other  panels,  I  would  like  to  focus  my  discussion  today  on 
one  key  piece  of  the  security  puzzle:  the  issue  of  security  clear-

ances,  both  in  the  general  national-security  sense  and  within  the 
specifics of the port-security realm. 

From my many roles in the local government as a county execu-
tive during and after the aftermath of 9/11 as a former prosecutor, 
to my current roles at the federal level, as a Member of the House 
Permanent Select Intelligence Committee, as Co–Chair of the Con-
gressional  Port  Security  Caucus,  and  as  the  Congressional  Rep-
resentative to both the Port of Baltimore and NSA, National Secu-
rity  Agency,  I  believe  a  modernized,  working,  security-clearance 
system is vital to defending our homeland, including our ports. 

The  Federal  Government  needs  to  take  further  action  to  ensure 
that the ability to share information is neither obstructed by a lack 
of  clearance  nor  by  bottlenecks  that  persist  today.  Our  current  se-
curity-clearance  system  is  not  working.  The  problem  is  not  just 
jeopardizing  our  port  security,  it  is  also  jeopardizing  our  national 
security. Many of the state, local, and business interests, and even 
some  federal  officials,  do  not  have  the  information  they  need  to 
keep  our  country  safe  because  they  don’t  have  the  proper  security 
clearances.  The  problems  stem  from  basic  situations,  where  work-
ers  don’t  know  how  to  fill  out  an  application,  to  the  more  com-
plicated, where one department is not sharing information with an-
other.  We’re  still  using  a  security-clearance  system  set  up  to  fight 
the  Cold  War,  even  though  the  Iron  Curtain  fell  years  ago  and  we 
are now fighting the war on terror. The process is fragmented, con-
fusing, cumbersome, and long. 

There are approximately three million individuals at the federal, 
state and local, and private-sector levels with some level of security 
clearance. It is estimated that 480,000 clearances are stuck in some 
sort of a backlog. The average security clearance takes over 1 year 
to  complete.  If  there  is  any  sort  of  problem  along  the  way,  it  can 
take months, or even years, longer. There are inconsistencies with-
in investigations, polygraph analysis, levels of security, and criteria 
considerations. 

In the 108th Congress, Congressman Waxman, former Congress-
man Bell, and I asked GAO to look at two critical questions regard-
ing  port  security  specifically,  and  homeland  security  in  general. 
The report is being released today. 

First,  we  asked  them  to  look  at  the  issue  of  information  sharing 
within the port-security domain, and investigate how it is working. 
Second, we asked them to look at port security as it relates to busi-
nesses  that  are  connected  to  the  port,  and  how  funding  is 
prioritized. Specifically, we asked them to investigate the risk-man-
agement approach being employed by the Department of Homeland 
Security in funding and grant decisions. 

The  GAO  report  is  entitled  ‘‘Maritime  Security:  New  Structures 
Have  Improved  Information  Sharing,  but  Security  Clearance  Proc-
essing Requires Further Attention.’’ It is the first report GAO is de-
livering on that request. We asked GAO to review the processes set 
in  place  to  improve  information  sharing  within  maritime  security 
following in our post–9/11 world with the passage of the Homeland 
Security Act of 2002 and the Maritime Transportation Security Act 
of 2002. 

The  Coast  Guard  has  an  awesome  task  of  protecting  our  water-
ways  and  securing  our  Nation’s  ports.  For  over  200  years,  the

Coast  Guard  has  patrolled  and  protected  our  coastlines,  which  to-
tals  today  over  95,000  miles.  The  Coast  Guard  is  doing  a  good  job 
based on their massive jurisdiction and the funding it has received, 
but more needs to be done. 

After  the  passage  of  the  MTSA,  the  Coast  Guard  reorganized. 
Each  of  the  country’s  359  ports  created  Area  Maritime  Security 
Committees  and  Interagency  Operational  Centers  to  coordinate 
multiple local, state, and federal agencies, along with private-sector 
shareholders.  This  is  a  good  thing.  This  is  about  sharing  informa-
tion  with  local,  state,  and  the  private  sector.  The  goal  is  to  facili-
tate  the  meaningful  necessity  of  information  sharing  which  is  so 
important  to  protect  our  ports.  Each  committee  designated  one 
member,  who  is  expected  to  have  the  proper  clearance  to  be  able 
to  analyze  classified  intelligence  information,  one  member  of  the 
359 ports. 

The GAO report found that only 28 of the 359 members had sub-
mitted  the  proper  paperwork  to  get  a  security  clearance.  That 
means  less  than  10  percent  of  our  Nation’s  ports  have  access  to 
critical  information  to  keep  us  safe.  Even  if  all  of  the  remaining 
331  members  applied  for  clearance  today,  it  would  take  at  least  1 
year to get them cleared. Al Qaeda is not going to wait until work-
ers get clearance to attack our country and our way of life. 

We’ve  identified  the  problem.  Now  let’s  address  one  of  the  many 
solutions. These solutions could not be achieved overnight, but they 
are some initial steps that will start a long journey to fix this prob-
lem. 

To  start,  and  as  a  result  of  the  hard  work  GAO  is  reporting 
today,  I  have  introduced  a  bipartisan  amendment  with  Chairman 
Tom Davis of Virginia, to the Homeland Security authorization bill 
expected  on  the  House  floor  this  week.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  have 
brought  a  copy  of  that  amendment,  submitted  to  the  House  Rules 
Committee  today,  and  I  would  ask  that  it  be  inserted  into  the 
record, as well. 

[The information referred to follows:]

Amendment to H.R. 1817 Offered by Mr. Ruppersberger of 

Maryland and Mr. Tom Davis of Virginia

At the end of title V, insert the following new section:

SEC.lll.IMPROVING  THE  SECURITY  CLEARANCE  PROCESS  FOR 

STATE AND LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS.

(a)  ESTABLISHMENT OF ASSISTANCE FOR SECURITY CLEARANCE DESK.—Section 
3001  of  the  Intelligence  Reform  and  Terrorism  Prevention  Act  of  2004  (Public  Law 
108–458;  50  U.S.C.  435b)  is  amended  by  redesignating  subsection  (i)  as  subsection 
(j) and by inserting after subsection (h) the following new subsection (i):

‘‘(i) ESTABLISHMENT OF ASSISTANCE FOR SECURITY CLEARANCE DESK.—

‘‘(1)  Not  later  than  90  days  after  the  selection  of  an  agency  pursuant  to 
subsection  (c),  the  head  of  the  entity  selected  pursuant  to  subsection  (b)  shall,  in 
consultation  with  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  Office  for  State  and  Local 
Government Coordination, direct the establishment, within any federal department, 
agency,  or  entity,  of  an  Assistance  for  Security  Clearance  Desk  (in  this  subsection 
referred  to  as  the  ‘ASC  Desk’)  to  assist  State  and  local  personnel  referred  by  any 
federal  departments,  agencies,  or  other  entities  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  per-
sonnel security clearances.

‘‘(2) The ASC Desk shall provide information, assistance, and guidance on 
the processes by which State and local personnel apply for personnel security clear-

ances;  initiate  and  process  personnel  security  investigations  and  periodic  reinves-
tigations; have personnel security clearances adjudicated; and access information re-
lated to the database established and maintained pursuant to subsection (e).

‘‘(3)  The  ASC  Desk  shall  publish  the  information,  assistance,  and  guid-
ance required under this section on a Government-maintained website, shall present 
such  information,  assistance,  and  guidance  in  a  format  that  is  easily  accessible  to 
State  and  local  personnel,  and  shall  operate  a  live,  in-person,  toll-free  telephone 
service  to  answer  questions  about  the  information,  assistance,  and  guidance  pro-
vided.’’.

(b) INCORPORATION OF STATE AND LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS INTO FEDERAL SECU-
RITY CLEARANCE PROCESSES.—Section  3001  of  the  Intelligence  Reform  and  Ter-
rorism  Prevention  Act  of  2004  (Public  Law  108–458;  50  U.S.C.  435b)  is  amended—
(1) in subsection (a)(6), by inserting ‘‘, and any State and local personnel,’’ 

before ‘‘to access classified information’’;

(2)  by  adding  at  the  end  of  subsection  (a)  the  following  new  paragraph:
‘‘(9)  The  term  ‘State  and  local  personnel’  has  the  meaning  provided  in 

subsection 892(f)(3) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 482(f)(3)).’’;

(3) in subsection (c)(1)—

require access to classified information’’; and

(A)  by  adding  ‘‘,  as  well  as  State  and  local  personnel,’’  before  ‘‘who 

personnel’’ and inserting ‘‘such security clearances’’; and

(B) by striking ‘‘security clearances of such employees and contractor 

(4)  in  subsection  (e),  by  inserting  ‘‘,  and  State  and  local  personnel,’’  after 

‘‘or government contractor personnel’’.

Mr.  RUPPERSBERGER.  This  amendment  creates  a  Help  Desk, 
called  the  ASC  Desk,  which  stands  for  the  Assistance  to  Security 
Clearance  Desk.  This  Help  Desk  is  for  state  and  local  individuals 
applying  for  security  clearances.  It  will  guide  individuals  through 
the  application,  investigation,  and  adjudication  process.  While 
agencies  still  retain  the  power  and  authority  they  have  under  cur-
rent  law,  the  ASC  Desk  will  help  our  first-responders  on  the  front 
lines having so much trouble getting through our complicated secu-
rity-clearance  process.  This  security-clearance  issue  is  a  problem 
not only facing the maritime industry, but also facing many federal 
agencies. All will benefit from this solution. 

It is also important that Ambassador Negroponte, the new Direc-
tor  of  National  Intelligence,  and  his  office  have  the  same  tools  to 
keep  our  families  and  communities  safe.  Terrorists  do  not  care  if 
we  are  Republicans  or  Democrats  when  they  target  us,  so  we,  as 
Members of Congress, must work together to solve this problem. It 
is our responsibility to oversee these changes and to ensure that we 
fix this problem to protect our country from a terrorist attack. 

I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today.

tractive  to  terrorists  to  either  import  weapons  for  destruction  or  to  shut  down 
the  global  supply  chain  and  cripple  our  economy.  Either  possibility  makes  port 
security a high priority for this Congress.

Port  security  is  broad  and  a  complex  issue  largely  due  to  the  reality  that  ports 
are  sprawling  commercial  hubs  usually  centrally  located  in  geographically  diverse 
areas.  Our  working  ports  stretch  across  coastlines,  river  ways  and  harbors  moving 
agricultural,  mineral,  petroleum,  and  paper  products  to  connect  with  highways  and 
railways  for  transport.  Tons  of  goods  are  imported  and  exported  through  our  ports 
every  day  in  bulk  and  containers  as  well  as  roll-on/roll-off  vehicles.  Our  ports  are 
also  home  to  some  of  our  most  beloved  recreational  activities  such  as  boating,  fish-
ing,  and  cruises—all  of  which  contribute  to  our  economy  and  our  very  way  of  life. 
With  so  many  distinguished  experts  in  port  security  following  me  on  your  other 
panels,  I  would  like  to  focus  my  discussion  today  on  one  key  piece  of  the  security 
puzzle—the  issue  of  security  clearances  both  in  the  general  national  security  sense 
and within the specifics of the port security realm. 

From  my  many  roles  in  local  government  (as  a  County  Executive  during  and  in 
the  aftermath  of  9/11,  as  a  former  prosecutor)  to  my  current  roles  at  the  federal 
level  (as  a  Member  of  the  House  Permanent  Select  Committee  on  Intelligence,  as 
Co-Chair  of  the  Congressional  Port  Security  Caucus,  and  as  the  congressional  rep-
resentative to both the Port of Baltimore and NSA), I believe a modernized working 
security  clearance  system  is  vital  to  defending  our  homeland,  including  our  ports. 
The  Federal  Government  needs  to  take  further  action  to  insure  that  the  ability 
to share information is neither obstructed by a lack of clearance nor by ‘‘bottlenecks’’ 
that persist today. Our current security clearance system is not working. This prob-
lem  is  not  just  jeopardizing  our  port  security.  It  is  also  jeopardizing  our  national 
security. Many of the state, local, and business interests and even some federal offi-
cials  do  not  have  the  information  they  need  to  keep  our  country  safe  because  they 
don’t have the proper security clearances. 

The problems stem from basic situations where workers don’t know how to fill out 
an  application . . . to  the  more  complicated  where  one  department  is  not  sharing 
information  with  another.  We  are  still  using  a  security  clearance  system  set  up  to 
fight  the  Cold  War  even  though  the  Iron  Curtain  fell  years  ago  and  we  are  now 
fighting the War on Terror. The process is fragmented, confusing, cumbersome, and 
long. 

There are approximately 3 million individuals at the federal, state, local and pri-
vate  sector  levels  with  some  level  of  a  security  clearance.  It  is  estimated  that 
480,000  clearances  are  stuck  in  some  sort  of  a  backlog.  The  average  security  clear-
ance  takes  over  one  year  to  complete.  If  there  is  any  sort  of  a  problem  along  the 
way,  it  can  take  months  or  even  years  longer.  There  are  inconsistencies  within  in-
vestigations, polygraph analyses, levels of scrutiny, and criteria considerations. 

In  the  108th  Congress,  Congressman  Waxman,  former  Congressman  Bell  and  I 
asked GAO to look at two critical questions regarding port security specifically and 
homeland  security  in  general.  The  report  is  being  released  today.  First,  we  asked 
them  to  look  at  the  issue  of  information  sharing  within  the  port  security  domain 
and  investigate  how  it  is  working.  Second,  we  asked  them  to  look  at  port  security 
as  it  relates  to  businesses  that  are  connected  to  the  port  and  how  funding  is 
prioritized.  Specifically,  we  asked  them  to  investigate  the  risk  management  ap-
proach  being  employed  by  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  in  funding  and 
grant decisions. The GAO report entitled ‘‘Maritime Security: New Structures Have 
Improved Information Sharing, but Security Clearance Processing Requires Further 
Attention’’  (GAO–05–394)  is  the  first  report  GAO  is  delivering  on  that  request.  We 
asked  GAO  to  review  the  processes  set  in  place  to  improve  information  sharing 
within  maritime  security  following  in  our  post-9/11  world  with  the  passage  of  the 
Homeland  Security  Act  of  2002  and  the  Maritime  Transportation  Security  Act 
(MTSA) of 2002. 

The Coast Guard has an awesome task of protecting our waterways and securing 
our Nation’s ports. For over two hundred years, the Coast Guard has patrolled and 
protected  our  coast  lines—which  today  totals  over  95,000  miles.  The  Coast  Guard 
is  doing  a  good  job  based  on  their  massive  jurisdiction  and  the  funding  it  has  re-
ceived but more needs to be done.

7

After  the  passage  of  MTSA,  the  Coast  Guard  reorganized  and  created  359  Area 
Maritime Security Committees and Interagency Operational Centers in ports across 
the  country  to  coordinate  multiple  local,  state  and  federal  agencies  along  with  pri-
vate  sector  stakeholders.  The  goal  is  to  facilitate  the  meaningful  necessity  of  infor-
mation  sharing  to  protect  our  ports.  Each  committee  designated  one  member  who 
is expected to have the proper clearance to be able to analyze classified intelligence 
information. 

The GAO report found that only 28 of the 359 members had submitted the proper 
paperwork  to  get  a  security  clearance.  That  means  less  than  8  percent  of  our  Na-
tion’s ports have access to critical information to keep us safe. Even if all of the re-
maining  331  members  applied  for  clearance  today,  it  would  take  a  least  a  year  for 
them  to  get  cleared.  Al  Qaeda  is  not  going  to  wait  until  workers  get  clearance  to 
attack our country and our way of life. 

We’ve identified the problem. Now let’s address one of the many solutions. These 
solutions  can  not  be  achieved  overnight  but  there  are  some  initial  steps  that  will 
start  a  long  journey  to  fix  this  problem.  To  start  and  as  a  result  of  the  hard  work 
GAO is reporting today, I have introduced a bipartisan amendment with Chairman 
Tom Davis of Virginia to the Homeland Security Authorization bill expected on the 
House  floor  this  week.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  brought  a  copy  of  that  amendment 
submitted to the House Rules Committee today and I would ask that it be inserted 
into the record as well. 

This  amendment  creates  a  help  desk  called  the  ASK  Desk,  which  stands  for  the 
Assistance to Security Clearance Desk. This help desk is for state and local individ-
uals  applying  for  security  clearances.  It  will  guide  individuals  through  the  applica-
tion,  investigation  and  adjudication  processes.  While  agencies  will  still  retain  the 
power and authority they have under current law, the ASK Desk will help our first 
responders  on  the  front  lines  having  so  much  trouble  getting  through  our  com-
plicated security clearance process. 

This  security  clearance  issue  is  a  problem  not  only  facing  the  Maritime  Industry 
but  also  facing  many  federal  agencies.  All  will  benefit  from  this  solution.  It  is  also 
important  that  Ambassador  Negroponte,  the  new  Director  of  National  Intelligence, 
and his office have the same tools to keep our families and communities safe. 

Terrorists  do  not  care  if  we  are  Republicans  or  Democrats  when  they  target  us 
so  we  as  Members  of  Congress  must  work  together  to  solve  this  problem.  It  is  our 
responsibility  to  oversee  these  changes  and  ensure  that  we  fix  this  problem  to  pro-
tect our country from a terrorist attack. 

I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today.

Senator INOUYE. Congressman, did you say that the average time 

span required for security investigation is over 1 year? 

Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Over 1 year. That’s the information that we 

have. 

Senator INOUYE. And that we——
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. And sometimes even longer. 
Senator INOUYE.—that we have over 480,000 waiting? 
Mr.  RUPPERSBERGER.  That’s  an  estimate,  but  that’s—about 
480,000. Complaints from all aspects. You know, one of the key ele-
ments in fighting terrorism is good intelligence, and it’s also the re-
lationship between our intelligence agencies and our private sector, 
some of the larger and smaller corporations. And wherever we go—
and  I  think  Senator  Rockefeller  would  confirm  this,  and  he’s  a 
Member  of  the  Senate  Intelligence  Committee—that  it’s  constant 
complaints  about  how  they  can’t  get  the  clearance,  it  just  takes  so 
long.  It’s  an  antiquated  process,  and,  until  we  fix  that  process——
My  staff  just  handed  me  some  information—450,000  backlog, 
850,000  waiting.  So  that’s  a  serious  process,  not  only  with  respect 
to  our  ports,  but  for  the  safety  of  our  country.  I  mean,  that’s  why 
we  have  a  new  Director  of  Intelligence.  And  hopefully  that  will  be 
one of Ambassador Negroponte’s high priorities. 

Senator  INOUYE.  And  did  you  say  that  only  10  percent  of  our 

ports have personnel who have been cleared to——

Mr.  RUPPERSBERGER.  Well,  no,  what  you  have  is,  the  Coast 
Guard,  who  has  an  awesome  responsibility,  and  they  have  put  to-
gether  what  they  call  Maritime  Security  Committees  in  each  one 
of their ports. And these committees are really the local, and state 
governments,  and  people  involved  working  within  the  port.  And 
that’s  almost  like  a  strike-force  concept.  The  main  focus  for  the 
Coast  Guard  is  information  sharing.  And  what  happens  is  that, 
with respect to information that the Coast Guard has, if it’s classi-
fied,  they  have  this  information  that  could  help  protect  the  ports, 
but  if  the  members  on  that  committee,  especially  a  designated 
member, do not have their clearances, they cannot share that infor-
mation unless the clearances are there. That has to be fixed. Infor-
mation sharing is one of the most important aspects of intelligence. 
Ten  percent  of  Coast  Guard  identified  committee  stakeholders, 
that’s  all  that  has  been  cleared.  And  then,  when  they  start  the 
clearance  process  today,  if  we  would  go  with  the  way  it’s  working 
now,  it  would  take  1  year.  As  I  said  in  my  testimony,  Al  Qaeda  is 
not going to wait for us to get cleared. 

Senator INOUYE. Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Any questions? 
Thank you very much. 
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Thank you. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  The  first  panel  is  Robert  Jacksta,  Executive  Di-
rector  of  Border  Security  and  Facilitation,  in  Customs;  Larry 
Hereth, Rear Admiral in the Coast Guard; and Mr. Skinner, Acting 
Inspector  General  of  the  Office—in  Homeland  Security;  and  Mar-
garet  Wrightson,  Director,  Homeland  Security  and  Justice  Issues, 
GAO. 

Let  us  proceed  in  the  order  in  which  I’ve  announced  them.  And 
we’ll  have—I  think  if  you’d  wait  until  the  time  the  GAO  witness 
is before us before you put up those panels, it’ll be better. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. You can’t read them, anyway. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Mr.  Jacksta,  then  Mr.—then  Admiral  Hereth, 
then Mr. Skinner, then Ms. Wrightson. Let’s have your statements, 
and then we’ll ask questions. 

STATEMENT  OF  ROBERT  JACKSTA,  EXECUTIVE  DIRECTOR, 
BORDER  SECURITY  AND  FACILITATION,  U.S.  CUSTOMS  AND 
BORDER PROTECTION 
Mr. JACKSTA. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Senator Inouye, and 

distinguished Members of the Committee. 

Thank you for this opportunity to update the Committee on U.S. 
Customs  and  Border  Protection,  CBP,  efforts  to  strengthen  mari-
time security. 

CBP,  as  the  guardian  of  the  Nation’s  borders,  safeguards  the 
homeland  foremost  by  protecting  the  American  public  against  ter-
rorism and instruments of terror. Today, trained CBP officers, tech-
nology,  automation,  electronic  information,  and  partnerships  with 
trade  and  foreign  governments  are  concepts  that  underpin  CBP’s 
port  security  and  antiterrorism  initiatives.  These  concepts  extend 
our  zone  of  security  outward  and  reinforce  the  components  of  our 
layered defense strategy.

My  remarks  today  will  focus  on  progress  related  to  the  Customs 
Trade  Partnership  Against  Terrorism,  C–TPAT,  the  Container  Se-
curity  Initiative,  CSI,  our  non-intrusive  inspection  technology,  and 
implementation of the Maritime Transportation Security Act. 

As  the  Customs  Trade  Partnership  Against  Terrorism  has 
evolved,  we  have  steadily  added  to  the  rigor  of  the  program.  In 
order  to  join  C–TPAT,  a  participant  must  commit  to  increasing  its 
supply  chain  security  to  meet  minimal  supply-chain-security  cri-
teria. Perhaps most importantly, participants also make a commit-
ment to work with their business partners and customers through-
out their supply chain to ensure that those businesses also increase 
their supply-chain-security. Moreover, CBP has worked towards ad-
dressing a number of areas, as recommended by GAO. Today, CBP 
validation  is  based  on  risk,  using  a  quantitative  risk-assessment 
tool to identify certified members with high-risk supply chains. 

In  addition,  CBP  has  published  a  C–TPAT  strategic  plan  clearly 
articulating program goals and strategies. CBP has also completed 
a C–TPAT human-capital plan, which addresses recruitment, train-
ing, and workload issues. 

Finally,  steps  have  been  taken  to  automate  key  processes  and 
implement  the  records-management  system  to  document  key  deci-
sions and operational events, including decisions made through the 
validation process and tracking member status. Within 3 years, our 
experience  has  grown  greatly  with  the  C–TPAT  program,  and  we 
continue to work very diligently to ensure member compliance. 

To  meet  our  priority  mission  of  preventing  terrorism  and  ter-
rorist  weapons  from  entering  the  United  States,  CBP  has  also 
partnered  with  other  countries  on  our  Container  Security  Initia-
tive. Almost 26,000 seagoing containers arrive and are offloaded at 
United  States  seaports  daily.  In  Fiscal  Year  2004,  that  equated  to 
9.6  million  containers.  Under  CSI,  we  are  partnering  with  our  for-
eign governments to identify and inspect high-risk cargo at foreign 
ports  before  they  are  shipped  to  our  seaports  and  pose  a  threat  to 
the United States. Today, CSI is operational in 36 foreign ports. 

In January 2004, CBP partnered with four C–TPAT importers to 
incorporate  a  container-security  device  into  the  container  sealing-
device  process.  This  enhances  container  security.  The  initial  phase 
of this initiative was designed to evaluate logistical and operational 
aspects, evaluate the technology being utilized, and collect and ana-
lyze technology-related data. 

Currently,  CBP  is  conducting  a  second  phase  of  activities  in  co-
operation  with  the  C–TPAT  members.  This  expansion  utilizes  an 
enhanced version of the container-security device evaluated during 
previous activities and will incorporate additional sensing capabili-
ties.  The  second-phase  test  will  incorporate  16  different  trade 
lanes, touching three continents, and seven CSI ports. 

Non-intrusive  technology  is  another  cornerstone  in  our  layered 
approach. Technologies deployed to our Nation’s ports of entries in-
clude  large-scale  X-ray  and  gamma-imaging  systems,  as  well  as  a 
variety of portable and handheld technologies, to include our recent 
focus  on  radiation-detection  equipment.  CBP  has  166  large-scale 
NII  systems  deployed  to  our  Nation’s  ports  of  entry.  There  are  59 
of these large-scale systems deployed to our seaports.

CBP is also moving quickly to deploy nuclear and radiological-de-
tection equipment to our ports of entry. CBP has deployed over 400 
radiation-isotope-identifier devices, and nearly 500 radiation portal 
monitors  (RPMs).  CBP  is  also  implementing  the  deployment  of 
RPMs  in  the  maritime  environment,  with  the  ultimate  goal  of 
screening  100  percent  of  all  containerized  imported  cargo  for  radi-
ation. 

Additionally,  CBP  has  deployed  personal  radiation  detectors  in 
quantities  necessary  for  ensuring  that  there  is  100  percent  cov-
erage  at  primary  inspection  sites,  where  the  final  point  of  contact 
with CBP takes place. 

CBP,  in  concert  with  our  sister  agencies,  continues  to  work  to-
ward  maritime  security,  as  mandated  by  the  Maritime  Transpor-
tation  Security  Act.  Efforts  include  the  establishment  of  the  DHS 
Commercial  Operational  Advisory  Committee  (COAC),  a  sub-
committee to assist DHS with the trade perspective on cargo secu-
rity-performance  standards  under  the  MTSA.  The  COAC  rec-
ommendations  have  assisted  CBP  with  understanding  the  trade 
community’s concerns and priorities. Further, recommendations are 
assisting CBP’s development of a proposed rule requiring that load-
ed containers be appropriately secured. 

CBP  is  also  supporting  the  implementation  of  additional  MTSA-
related  issues  in  coordination  with  TSA  and  the  Coast  Guard. 
These  include  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  International  Port  Security 
Program,  Area  Maritime  Security  Committees,  port  vulnerability 
assessments,  and 
Identification 
Credentialing. 

the  Transportation  Worker 

Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  believe  CBP  has 
demonstrated, and will continue to demonstrate, its leadership and 
commitment to maritime security efforts. Thank you for the oppor-
tunity  to  testify.  I  will  be  happy  to  answer  any  questions  you  may 
have. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Jacksta follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT JACKSTA, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, BORDER 

SECURITY AND FACILITATION, U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION 

Good  morning  Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Inouye,  and  distinguished  Members  of  the 
Committee.  Thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  update  the  Committee  on  U.S.  Cus-
toms and Border Protection’s (CBP) efforts to strengthen maritime security. 

CBP, as the guardian of the Nation’s borders, safeguards the homeland—foremost, 
by  protecting  the  American  public  against  terrorists  and  the  instruments  of  terror; 
while  at  the  same  time  enforcing  the  laws  of  the  United  States  and  fostering  the 
Nation’s economic security through lawful travel and trade. Today, trained CBP Of-
ficers,  technology,  automation,  electronic  information,  and  partnerships  with  the 
trade  and  foreign  governments  are  concepts  that  underpin  CBP’s  port  security  and 
anti-terrorism  initiatives.  These  concepts  extend  our  zone  of  security  outward  and 
reinforce the components of our layered defense strategy. 

My  remarks  today  will  focus  on  progress  related  to  the  Customs-Trade  Partner-
ship  Against  Terrorism  (C–TPAT),  the  Container  Security  Initiative  (CSI),  Non-In-
trusive  Inspection  (NII)  and  Radiation  Detection  Technology  (RDT),  and  the  imple-
mentation of the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA). 
Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C–TPAT) 

As  the  Customs-Trade  Partnership  Against  Terrorism  (C–TPAT)  has  evolved,  we 
have steadily added to the rigor of the program. In order to join C–TPAT, a partici-
pant  must  commit  to  increasing  its  supply  chain  security  to  meet  minimal  supply 
chain security criteria. Perhaps most importantly, participants also make a commit-
ment  to  work  with  their  business  partners  and  customers  throughout  their  supply 
chains to ensure that those businesses also increase their supply-chain-security. By

leveraging the influence of importers and others on different participants in the sup-
ply  chain,  C–TPAT  is  able  to  increase  security  of  United  States  bound  goods  to  the 
point  of  origin  (i.e.,  to  the  point  of  container  stuffing).  This  reach  is  critical  to  the 
goal of increasing supply-chain-security. 

Moreover,  CBP  has  worked  towards  addressing  a  number  of  areas  as  rec-
ommended  by  the  General  Accountability  Office.  Today,  CBP  initiates  validations 
based  on  risk,  using  a  quantitative  risk  assessment  tool  to  identify  certified  mem-
bers with high-risk supply chains. CBP’s new validation objective identifies and vali-
dates  high-risk  supply  chain  components,  while  engaging  C–TPAT  members  with 
the  greatest  leverage  over  their  foreign  components  of  the  international  supply 
chain.  This  refined  validation  objective  allows  CBP  to  direct  resources  accordingly, 
where  they  can  have  the  most  impact  in  meeting  the  overall  objectives  of  the  C–
TPAT  program.  In  late  October  2004,  in  discussions  with  the  trade  community,  we 
began  drafting  more  clearly  defined,  minimum-security  criteria  for  importers  wish-
ing  to  participate  in  the  C–TPAT  program.  After  months  of  constructive  dialogue, 
we  developed  minimum  security  criteria  designed  to  accomplish  two  important 
goals:  first,  to  offer  flexibility  to  accommodate  the  diverse  business  models  rep-
resented  within  the  international  supply  chain;  and  second,  to  achieve  CBP’s  twin 
goals  of  security  and  facilitation.  The  minimum-security  criteria  for  importers  be-
came effective on March 25, 2005. 

In  addition,  CBP  has  published  the  C–TPAT  Strategic  Plan,  clearly  articulating 
program  goals  and  strategies,  and  completed  the  C–TPAT  Human  Capital  Plan, 
which addresses recruitment, training and workload issues. 

CBP  recognizes  the  need  for  effective  measures  to  determine  the  success  of  the 
program.  While  new  measures  are  under  development,  C–TPAT  currently  uses 
quantifiable  workload  measures,  but  gauging  deterrence  and  prevention  remains  a 
challenging  task.  We  continue  our  efforts  in  this  area,  focusing  on  effective  meas-
ures that help gauge the success of C–TPAT partnership. 

Finally,  steps  have  been  taken  to  automate  key  processes,  and  implement  a 
records  management  system  to  document  key  decisions  and  operational  events,  in-
cluding decisions made through the validation process, and tracking member status. 
With 3 years’ experience in the program, C–TPAT has successfully increased supply-
chain-security  through  the  voluntary  enrollment  and  enhancement  of  supply-chain-
security by the private sector, and learned much about the program and its partici-
pants. 
The Container Security Initiative (CSI) 

To  meet  our  priority  mission  of  preventing  terrorists  and  terrorist  weapons  from 
entering  the  United  States,  CBP  has  partnered  with  other  countries  on  our  Con-
tainer  Security  Initiative  (CSI).  Almost  26,000  seagoing  containers  arrive  and  are 
off loaded at United States seaports each day. In Fiscal Year 2004, that equated to 
9.6 million cargo containers annually. Because of the sheer volume of sea container 
traffic  and  the  opportunities  it  presents  for  terrorists,  containerized  shipping  is 
uniquely vulnerable to terrorist exploitation. Under CSI, which is the first program 
of its kind, we are partnering with foreign governments to identify and inspect high-
risk  cargo  containers  at  foreign  ports  before  they  are  shipped  to  our  seaports  and 
pose  a  threat  to  the  United  States  and  to  global  trade.  Today,  CSI  is  operational 
in  36  ports.  CBP  is  working  towards  strategically  locating  CSI  in  additional  loca-
tions focusing on areas of the world where terrorists have a presence. CBP will con-
tinue expanding the CSI security network by using advanced technologies while op-
timizing resources such as the National Targeting Center as a communications hub 
coordinating  domestic  and  international  communication.  Through  a  framework  for 
security  and  facilitation  of  global  trade,  endorsed  by  the  World  Customs  Organiza-
tion, CBP intends to strengthen trade data and targeting by promoting harmonized 
standards for data elements, examinations and risk assessments. Further, to inspect 
all high-risk containers before they are loaded on board vessels to the United States, 
CBP  plans  to  continue  fostering  partnerships  with  other  countries  and  our  trading 
partners. 
CBP Smart Box Initiative 

In  January  2004,  CBP  partnered  with  four  C–TPAT  importers  to  incorporate  a 
Container Security Device (CSD) into the container sealing process, along with seal-
ing  standards  and  techniques,  in  order  to  develop  and  implement  a  Smart  Box  de-
signed  to  enhance  container  security.  The  initial  phase  of  the  initiative  was  de-
signed  to  evaluate  the  logistical  and  operational  aspects,  evaluate  the  technology 
being  utilized,  and  collect  and  analyze  technology-related  data.  Data  collected  dur-
ing  the  initial  phase,  as  well  as  subsequent  phases,  will  be  used  to  assist  CBP  in 
developing minimum standards for a Smart Box.

Currently,  CBP  is  conducting  a  second  phase  of  activities  in  cooperation  with  a 
total  of  14  C–TPAT  members.  This  expansion  utilizes  an  enhanced  version  of  the 
CSD evaluated during previous activities and will incorporate additional sensing ca-
pabilities.  This  second  phase  test  will  incorporate  16  different  trade  lanes  touching 
3 continents (North America, Europe and Asia) and 7 CSI ports. 

Other  efforts  include  participation  in  the  evaluation  of  technology  designed  to  in-
corporate  additional  sensing  capabilities  with  the  goal  of  providing  six  sided  con-
tainer  security.  The  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  Science  and  Tech-
nology  (S&T)  Directorate  lead  this  effort.  CBP  personnel  are  active  members  of  an 
Integrated  Process  and  Product  Team  (IPPT)  and  are  working  in  coordination  with 
DHS S&T to identify and evaluate future technologies. 
Non-Intrusive Inspection and Radiation Detection Technologies 

Non-Intrusive  Inspection  Technology  (NII)  is  another  cornerstone  in  our  layered 
strategy.  Technologies  deployed  to  our  Nation’s  sea,  air,  and  land  border  ports  of 
entry include large-scale X-ray and gamma-imaging systems as well as a variety of 
portable  and  hand-held  technologies  to  include  our  recent  focus  on  radiation  detec-
tion  technology.  NII  technologies  are  viewed  as  force  multipliers  that  enable  us  to 
screen  or  examine  a  larger  portion  of  the  stream  of  commercial  traffic  while  facili-
tating the flow of legitimate trade, cargo, and passengers. 

CBP  has  166  large-scale  NII  systems  deployed  to  our  Nation’s  air,  land,  and  sea 
ports  of  entry.  There  are  59  of  these  large  scale  systems  deployed  to  seaports  on 
both  coasts  and  the  Caribbean.  The  systems  include  the  Vehicle  and  Cargo  Inspec-
tion System (VACIS), Mobile VACIS, Truck X-ray, Mobile Truck X-ray, Rail VACIS, 
Mobile  Sea  Container  Examination  Systems,  and  the  Pallet  Gamma-ray  system. 
CBP is also moving quickly to deploy nuclear and radiological detection equipment, 
including Personal Radiation Detectors (PRDs), Radiation Isotope Identifier Devices 
(RIIDs)  and  Radiation  Portal  Monitors  (RPMs)  to  our  ports  of  entry.  CBP  has  de-
ployed over 400 RIIDs and nearly 500 RPMs. CBP is also initiating the deployment 
of  RPMs  in  the  maritime  environment  with  the  ultimate  goal  of  screening  100  per-
cent  of  all  containerized  imported  cargo  for  radiation.  A  variety  of  configurations 
have been developed and CBP is working with stakeholders to ensure that radiation 
screening does not significantly impact operations within a port. During the upcom-
ing year CBP looks forward to working with the new DHS Domestic Nuclear Detec-
tion Office to couple these varying configurations into a cohesive global architecture 
to  greatly  increase  the  Nation’s  radiological  and  nuclear  detection  capability.  Addi-
tionally,  CBP  has  deployed  PRDs  in  quantities  necessary  for  ensuring  that  there  is 
100  percent  coverage  at  primary,  the  first  point  of  contact.  Currently,  over  10,000 
PRDs have been deployed. Used in combination with our layered enforcement strat-
egy,  these  tools  currently  provide  CBP  with  a  significant  capacity  to  detect  nuclear 
or radiological materials. 

Maritime  Transportation  Security  Act  of  2002  (MTSA)  CBP,  in  concert  with  our 
sister  agencies,  continues  to  work  towards  maritime  security  mandates  as  outlined 
in the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA). Efforts include the es-
tablishment  of  a  DHS  Commercial  Operational  Advisory  Committee  (COAC)  sub-
committee.  As  requested  by  the  Border  and  Transportation  Security  Directorate 
(BTS),  a  COAC  subcommittee  was  formed  to  assist  DHS  with  a  trade  perspective 
on cargo security performance standards under MTSA. 

The  COAC’s  recommendations  have  assisted  CBP  with  understanding  the  trade 
community’s  concerns  and  priorities.  Further,  under  the  direction  of  BTS,  rec-
ommendations  are  assisting  CBP’s  development  of  a  proposed  rule  requiring  that 
loaded  containers  be  appropriately  secured  by  use  of  an  International  Organization 
for  Standardization  (ISO)-compliant  high  security  seal  and  verified  by  the  carrier 
prior  to  being  transported  by  vessel  to  the  United  States.  CBP  is  also  supporting 
the  implementation  of  additional  MTSA  related  issues  in  coordination  with  BTS, 
USCG, and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). These include:

• USCG  International  Port  Security  Program—CBP  CSI  teams  work  in  concert 

with USCG to conduct joint assessments of foreign ports.

• Area Maritime Security Committees (AMSC)—CBP senior field office managers 

are participating in the USCG led AMS Committees.

• Port  Vulnerability  Assessments—CBP  field  offices  participated  in  the  USCG 

port assessments addressing cargo security operations.

• Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credentialing  (TWIC)—CBP  is  coordi-

nating with TSA and USCG to assist their efforts to develop this program.

Conclusion 

13

Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, I have outlined a broad array of initia-
tives  and  steps  towards  enhancing  maritime  security.  I  believe  CBP  has  dem-
onstrated and will continue to demonstrate its leadership and commitment to mari-
time security efforts, and we anticipate that working with our sister agencies under 
the Department of Homeland Security we will further these efforts. 

Thank  you  again  for  the  opportunity  to  testify.  I  will  be  happy  to  answer  any 

questions you may have.

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Admiral. 

STATEMENT OF REAR ADMIRAL LARRY HERETH,

U.S. COAST GUARD 

Admiral  HERETH.  Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman  and  distin-

guished Members of the Committee. 

I look forward to discussing the Coast Guard’s role to secure our 

ports and ensure the safe and efficient flow of commerce. 

The  Coast  Guard’s  overarching  security  goal  is  to  prevent  ter-
rorist  attacks  within  the  U.S.  maritime  domain.  Doing  so  requires 
a  risk-based  approach  to  identify  and  intercept  threats,  ideally  be-
fore  they  reach  our  shores.  Our  Nation’s  maritime  transportation 
system, as mentioned before, is extensive. Protecting this system is 
a significant challenge. A maritime terrorist attack, with its associ-
ated ripple effect, would have a severe impact on the Nation’s econ-
omy; so, clearly, this is a system we must protect. 

Since  trade  is  global,  and  terrorism  is  global,  we  felt  obligated 
and  necessary  to  build  a  global  security  regime.  Our  domestic  and 
international efforts have focused on implementation of MTSA and 
the  corresponding  International  Ship  and  Port  Facility  security 
code, or the ISPS Code, as it’s known. We’ve collaborated with 147 
other countries at the International Maritime Organization to build 
a  new  and  substantial  security  code  that  applies  to  vessels  and  to 
port  facilities  around  the  entire  world.  The  international  require-
ments mirror the domestic standards set forth in MTSA. 

To  complement  the  new  security  standards,  we  worked  in  par-
allel  with  the  International  Standards  Organization  to  develop  an 
implementation guide to aid companies as they put this—into prac-
tice  this  major  change.  The  IMO  and  ISO  have  been  key  allies  in 
developing  the  requirements  and  practical  standards  that  lead  to 
consistency  and  greater  compliance.  This  international  approach 
provides  an  efficient  and  effective  security  regime  that  can  be 
checked by all our trading partners, not just the United States. 

Implementation,  however,  has  been  a  big  challenge  to  all  the 
stakeholders.  With  over  9,000  U.S.  vessels,  3,200  U.S.  facilities, 
and  8,000  foreign  vessels  that  trade  with  the  United  States,  we 
have a huge challenge before us. 

I  am  pleased  to  report,  however,  that  the  compliance  rates  are 
near  99  percent  across  the  board.  This  was  due,  in  large  measure, 
to the collaboration and excellent relationships we have with indus-
try  and  with  trade  associations.  You  will  hear  from  two  of  those 
trade associations in the later panel. The efforts of the AAPA and—
American  Association  of  Port  Authorities  and  the  World  Shipping 
Council are representative of the helpful advice and support we re-
ceived  throughout  the  standards-development  phase,  and  are  to  be 
commended.

14

I  also  note  that,  as  required  by  MTSA,  we  have  established  an 
International  Port  Security  Program  that  works  in  concert  with 
other  federal  agencies  to  identify  foreign  ports  posing  a  potential 
security risk to the international marine transportation system. To 
date,  we  have  visited  23  countries.  Five  countries  are  currently  on 
our  Port  Security  Advisory  List,  because  they  have  not  imple-
mented the new international standards. 

There  are,  however,  long-term  challenges  ahead.  In  the  post–
MTSA  ISPF  period,  we  realized  the  Coast  Guard  was  planning  or 
beginning work on numerous additional security projects. Those ef-
forts were spread out amongst many various offices, and there was 
also a lot of interagency coordination underway in those efforts. To 
address  this,  we  developed  an  inventory  of  projects  to  help  us  re-
fine,  align,  and  coordinate  our  efforts.  Taken  together,  this  list  of 
projects represents the next wave of improvements to maritime se-
curity. 

Cargo  security  is  another  challenge,  a  long-term  challenge  that 
deserves  comment.  Customs  and  Border  Protection  has  the  lead 
role  in  cargo  security,  and  the  Coast  Guard  works  to  coordinate 
with our sister agency to align respective agency roles and respon-
sibilities. 

When  cargo  is  moved  on  the  waterborne  leg  of  the  trade  route, 
the Coast Guard has oversight of the cargo’s carriage requirements 
and the care needed for that cargo while it’s in transit, both on the 
vessel  and  at  the  port  facility.  Customs,  CBP,  has  authority  over 
the  cargo  contents  and  the  container  improvements.  Using  the  in-
formation provided through the Coast Guard’s 96-hour notice-of-ar-
rival  rule  and  Customs’  24-hour  cargo-loading  rule,  we  can  act  to 
control vessels, and, thus, their cargoes, that pose an unacceptable 
risk  to  our  ports.  With  Coast  Guard  officers  posted  at  Customs’, 
CBP’s,  National  Targeting  Center,  we  have  improved  agency  co-
ordination, and our collective ability to quickly take appropriate ac-
tion exists when notified of a cargo problem. 

Identity security is another vulnerability that must be addressed. 
Domestically,  the  Coast  Guard  is  now  supporting  TSA  to  imple-
ment  the  Transportation  Worker  Identity  Credential,  and  we’ll  do 
everything we can to expedite that process. 

With regard to foreign seafarers, we presently have a multi-agen-
cy workgroup tasked to define the potential improvements possible 
and  provide  a  proposed  course  of  action.  That  involves  a  number 
of  different  agencies,  including  Justice,  State,  Transportation,  and 
a variety of elements from DHS. 

Thank  you,  again,  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today.  I  will  be 

pleased to answer any questions at the appropriate time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REAR ADMIRAL LARRY HERETH, U.S. COAST GUARD 

Introduction 

Good  morning  Mr.  Chairman  and  distinguished  Members  of  the  Committee.  It  is 
a  pleasure  to  be  here  today  to  discuss  the  Coast  Guard’s  role  in  securing  our  ports 
in order to facilitate the safe and efficient flow of commerce. 

On  September  10th,  2001,  our  primary  maritime  focus  was  on  the  safe  and  effi-
cient  use  of  America’s  waterways.  However,  as  a  result  of  the  events  of  9/11,  we 
have made great progress in securing America’s waterways, without impeding com-
merce. The men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard and the Department of Home-

land Security remain committed to improving maritime homeland security each and 
every  day  through  continued  interagency  cooperation  and  assistance  from  our  part-
ners at the local, state, and international levels as well as maritime industry stake-
holders. 
Reducing Maritime Risk 

The  Coast  Guard’s  overarching  security  goal  is  to  prevent  the  exploitation  of,  or 
terrorist  attacks  within,  the  U.S.  maritime  domain.  Doing  so  requires  a  threat-
based,  risk-managed  approach  to  identify  and  intercept  threats  well  before  they 
reach U.S. shores. The Coast Guard accomplishes this by conducting layered, multi-
agency security operations nationwide; while strengthening the security posture and 
reducing  the  vulnerability  of  our  ports,  with  the  initial  focus  being  our  militarily 
and economically strategic ports. As we seek to reduce maritime risk, we continually 
strive to balance each of the Coast Guard’s mission requirements to ensure minimal 
degradation  in  service  to  the  American  public.  Looking  at  their  accomplishments, 
it  is  clear  that  Coast  Guard  men  and  women  continue  to  rise  to  the  challenge  and 
deliver tangible and important results across both homeland security and non-home-
land security missions. 

Today’s  global  maritime  safety  and  security  environment  requires  a  new  level  of 
operations  specifically  directed  against  terrorism  without  degrading  other  critical 
maritime  safety  missions.  Most  importantly,  the  Coast  Guard  must  exercise  its  full 
suite  of  authorities,  capabilities,  competencies  and  partnerships  to  mitigate  mari-
time security risks in the post-9/11 world. 

In  terms  of  threat,  vulnerability,  and  consequence,  there  are  few  more  valuable 

and vulnerable targets than the U.S. maritime transportation system.

• Threat:  While  the  9/11  Commission  notes  the  continuing  threat  against  our 
aviation  system,  it  also  states  that  ‘‘opportunities  to  do  harm  are  as  great,  or 
greater,  in  maritime  or  surface  transportation.’’  From  smuggling  to  piracy,  sui-
cide attacks to the threat of weapons of mass destruction, the threats are many 
and varied.
• Vulnerability:  The  maritime  transportation  system  annually  accommodates 
6.5 million cruise ship passengers, 51,000 port calls by over 7,500 foreign ships, 
at  more  than  360  commercial  ports  spread  out  over  95,000  miles  of  coastline. 
The  vastness  of  this  system  and  its  widespread  and  diverse  critical  infrastruc-
ture  leave  the  Nation  vulnerable  to  terrorist  acts  within  our  ports,  waterways, 
and  coastal  zones,  as  well  as  exploitation  of  maritime  commerce  as  a  means  of 
transporting terrorists and their weapons.
• Consequence:  Contributing  nearly  $750  billion  to  the  U.S.  gross  domestic 
product  annually  and  handling  95  percent  of  all  overseas  trade  each  year—the 
value  of  the  U.S.  maritime  domain  and  the  consequence  of  any  significant  at-
tack cannot be overstated. Independent analysis and the experiences of 9/11 and 
the  West  Coast  dock  workers  strike  demonstrates  an  economic  impact  of  a 
forced  closure  of  U.S.  ports  for  a  period  of  only  8  days  to  have  been  in  excess 
of $58 billion to the U.S. economy.

Lingering  and  new  maritime  safety  and  security  gaps  continually  present  them-
selves  and  it  is  these  risks  we  will  continually  work  to  reduce.  The  Coast  Guard 
guides  its  efforts  by  implementing  policies,  seeking  resources,  and  deploying  capa-
bilities through the lens of our maritime security strategy. 
Implement the Maritime Strategy for Homeland Security 

Considering  the  vast  economic  utility  of  our  ports,  waterways,  and  coastal  ap-
proaches, it is clear that a terrorist incident against our marine transportation sys-
tem would have a disastrous impact on global shipping, international trade, and the 
world economy, in addition to the strategic military value of many ports and water-
ways. 

The  elements  of  the  Coast  Guard’s  Maritime  Strategy  for  Homeland  Security  are 
in direct alignment with the DHS’ strategic goals of Awareness, Prevention, Protec-
tion,  Response  and  Recovery.  These  elements  serve  as  guiding  pillars  in  our  efforts 
to reduce America’s vulnerabilities to terrorism by enhancing our ability to prevent 
terrorist  attacks  and  limit  the  damage  to  our  Nation’s  ports,  coastal  infrastructure 
and  population  centers  in  the  event  a  terrorist  attack  occurs.  A  brief  overview  of 
the  core  elements  of  that  strategy  with  particular  emphasis  on  creation  and  man-
agement  of  a  robust  security  regime  is  presented  here  in  the  following  paragraphs. 
Enhance Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) 

First,  we  seek  to  increase  our  awareness  and  knowledge  of  what  is  happening  in 
the  maritime  arena,  not  just  here  in  American  waters,  but  globally.  We  need  to 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  11:29 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025728 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\25728.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

16

know  which  vessels  are  in  operation,  the  names  of  the  crews  and  passengers,  and 
the  ship’s  cargo,  especially  those  inbound  for  U.S.  ports.  Maritime  Domain  Aware-
ness (MDA) is critical to separate the law-abiding sailor from the anomalous threat. 
The  core  of  our  MDA  efforts  revolve  around  the  development  and  employment  of 
accurate  information,  intelligence,  and  targeting  of  vessels,  cargo,  crews  and  pas-
sengers—and  extending  this  well  beyond  our  traditional  maritime  boundaries.  All 
DHS components are working to provide a layered defense through collaborative ef-
forts  with  our  interagency  and  international  partners  to  counter  and  manage  secu-
rity  risks  long  before  they  reach  a  U.S.  port.  There  are  two  hallmarks  to  today’s 
security  environment;  complexity  and  ambiguity.  Improving  MDA  will  help  us  to 
simplify  the  complex  and  clarify  the  ambiguous  and  prove  invaluable  to  facilitating 
effective resource, operational, and policy decision-making. 
Create and Oversee Maritime Security Regime 

Second,  to  help  prevent  terrorist  attacks  we  have  developed  and  continue  to  im-
prove an effective maritime security regime—both domestically and internationally. 
This  element  of  our  strategy  focuses  on  our  domestic  and  international  efforts  and 
includes initiatives related to MTSA enforcement, International Maritime Organiza-
tion regulations such as the ISPS Code, as well as improving supply chain security 
and identity security processes. 

Before 9/11 we had no formal international or domestic maritime security regime 
for  ports,  port  facilities,  and  ships—with  the  exception  of  cruise  ships.  Partnering 
with  domestic  and  international  stakeholders,  we  now  have  both  a  comprehensive 
domestic  security  regime  and  an  international  security  convention  in  place.  Both 
have been in force since July 1, 2004. In executing the requirements of the Maritime 
Transportation  Security  Act  (MTSA)  and  the  International  Ship  and  Port  Facility 
Security (ISPS) code, the Coast Guard has:

nomically strategic ports;

mestic facility security plans;

• Reviewed and approved over 9,600 domestic vessel security plans and 3,100 do-
• Overseen the development of 43 Area Maritime Security Plans and Committees;
• Verified security plan implementation on 8,100 foreign vessels;
• Completed all domestic port security assessments for the 55 militarily and eco-
• Visited  22  foreign  countries  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  anti-terrorism  meas-
ures and implementation of ISPS code requirements. An additional 10 countries 
are scheduled for visits by June 2005 with the goal of visiting all of our approxi-
mately 140 maritime trading partners; and
• Oversaw  the  continuing  development  of  the  National  Maritime  Security  Plan.
Aside from the statistics, MTSA and ISPS are truly landmark achievements with-
in  the  maritime  industry.  Through  a  variety  of  measures,  or  layers,  of  regulatory 
requirements,  these  two  regimes  complement  each  other  and  have  gone  far  to  re-
duce  vulnerabilities  within  the  global  maritime  transportation  system,  the  general 
framework of which includes:

• Physical  Security:  The  first  pillar  of  this  framework  is  physical  security. 
Through  the  implementation  of  the  MTSA,  we  have  significantly  hardened  the 
physical  security  of  our  ports.  Roughly  3,100  of  the  Nation’s  highest  risk  port 
facilities  have  implemented  mandatory  access  control  measures  to  ensure  that 
only  authorized  persons  are  able  to  gain  access.  They  have  established  des-
ignated restricted areas within the facility gates and facility owners and opera-
tors are now required, under federal regulations, to implement screening proto-
cols  for  ensuring  that  cargo-transport  vehicles  and  persons  entering  the  facili-
ties  are  inspected  to  deter  the  unauthorized  introduction  of  dangerous  sub-
stances and devices. At the facility gates, containers are required to be checked 
for evidence of tampering and cargo seals are checked.
• Identity  Security:  Identity  verification  is  the  second  critical  element  of  port 
security,  recognizing  that  we  must  know  and  trust  those  who  are  provided 
unescorted access to our port facilities and vessels. The 9/11 Commission report 
noted  that  the  September  11th  hijackers  obtained  and  used  government-issued 
identification  cards  such  as  driver’s  licenses.  The  Commission  recommended 
that  forms  of  identification  be  made  more  secure.  Congress  partially  addressed 
this issue in the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 with the require-
ment  for  the  Transportation  Workers  Identification  Card  or  TWIC.  However, 
merchant mariner documents are, by statute, identification documents, yet they 
contain  virtually  no  security  features.  This,  among  other  reasons,  is  why  the 
Commandant, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the President have pro-

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  11:29 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025728 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\25728.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

17

posed  a  complete  update  of  the  merchant  mariner  credentialing  statutes.  We 
cannot,  and  must  not,  continue  with  business  as  usual  in  the  area  of  mariner 
credentialing.  The  specter  of  a  terrorist  obtaining  and  using  a  merchant  mar-
iner  credential  to  access  and  attack  vital  areas  of  a  strategic  port  is  one  that 
is  very  real.  The  changes  we  have  proposed  will  enable  the  Department  to 
heighten  the  security  of  all  mariner  credentials  in  partnership  with  the  mari-
ners themselves and the maritime industry.
The  Coast  Guard  is  also  working  very  closely  with  the  Transportation  Security 
Administration (TSA), the lead for implementation of the Transportation Work-
er  Identification  Card  (TWIC),  to  assist  in  the  implementation  of  this  new 
credentialing  program.  Just  over  six  months  ago,  TSA  approached  the  Coast 
Guard  and  asked  for  assistance  in  implementing  the  TWIC  in  the  maritime 
mode  through  a  regulatory  project.  The  Coast  Guard  is  fully  supportive  of  this 
regulatory  effort  and  will  do  everything  within  our  ability  to  assist  TSA  in  the 
development of this rulemaking.
• Cargo  Security:  Cargo  security  encompasses  the  process  of  ensuring  that  all 
cargo  bound  for  the  U.S.  is  legitimate  and  was  properly  supervised  from  the 
point  of  origin,  through  its  sea  transit,  and  during  its  arrival  at  the  final  des-
tination in the U.S.
Since Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has the lead role in maritime cargo 
security, the Coast Guard has worked in concert with our sister agency to align 
respective agency roles and responsibilities regarding international trade. When 
a cargo is moved on the waterborne leg of the trade route, the Coast Guard has 
oversight of the cargo’s care and carriage on the vessels and within the port fa-
cility.  The  Coast  Guard  also  oversees  the  training  and  identity  verification  of 
the people who are moving the cargo. CBP has authority over the cargo contents 
and  container  standards.  Using  the  information  provided  through  the  Coast 
Guard’s 96-hour notice of arrival rule and CBP’s 24-hour cargo loading rule, we 
can act to control vessels, and thus their cargoes, that pose an unacceptable risk 
to  our  ports.  With  Coast  Guard  officers  posted  at  CBP’s  National  Targeting 
Center,  we  continuously  improve  agency  coordination  and  our  collective  ability 
to quickly take appropriate action when notified of a cargo of interest. As a fur-
ther  improvement,  the  trade  community  can  file  required  passenger  and  crew 
information  via  an  electronic  notice  of  arrival  and  departure  system.  This 
streamlines the process for industry and improves our ability to apply targeting 
and selectivity methods.
The  Coast  Guard  has  worked  hard  to  align  all  of  our  regulatory  and  policy  de-
velopment efforts with CBP. We meet regularly to discuss policy, we participate 
on inter-agency regulation development teams, and we sit on the Operation Safe 
Commerce  Executive  Steering  Committee.  Between  DHS,  CBP,  and  the  Coast 
Guard,  we  coordinate  the  work  of  our  various  Federal  Advisory  Committees  so 
that we all understand the trade community’s concerns and priorities. Now that 
MTSA and the ISPS Code are fully implemented, we are monitoring compliance 
and  carefully  noting  issues  for  future  improvements  to  the  regulatory  frame-
work.
Looking at specific cargo-related initiatives, the Coast Guard fully supports the 
Container  Security  Initiative  and  the  Customs-Trade  Partnership  Against  Ter-
rorism. We look forward to the results of Operation Safe Commerce, which will 
highlight  technologies  and  business  practices  that  will  bring  improved,  layered 
security throughout the supply chain. We also agree with CBP’s view that inter-
national compliance and the establishment of international standards are need-
ed to help gain global compliance. In this way, the International Standards Or-
ganization  and  the  International  Maritime  Organization  have  achieved  great 
success in institutionalizing both safety and security standards, many times in-
corporating  industry  standards  by  reference.  A  multilateral  approach  provides 
a  more  efficient  and  effective  security  regime.  Compliance  with  a  common,  ac-
ceptable  standard  is  checked  by  all  our  trading  partners,  not  just  the  U.S.  The 
evidence of success can be directly measured in the level of compliance. A prime 
example  is  the  success  of  the  ISPS  Code  implementation  evidenced  by  the  98 
percent compliance rate achieved by foreign vessels arriving in U.S. ports.
• Culture of Security: Finally, and perhaps most importantly we have been able 
to  take  important  steps  to  instill  a  culture  of  security  within  a  system  pre-
viously  focused  almost  exclusively  on  efficiency.  Reducing  the  vulnerabilities  of 
our  vessels  and  ports  required  a  cultural  shift  to  put  security  at  the  top  of  the 
agenda  rather  than  as  an  afterthought.  It  is  centered  on  the  people  who  must 
implement  the  new  security  measures.  Under  our  MTSA  regulations,  facilities

18

and  vessels  are  required  to  designate  individuals  with  security  responsibilities, 
including company security officers, facility security officers, and vessel security 
officers. These individuals must have knowledge, thorough training and equiva-
lent job experience. They must be familiar with, and responsible for, implemen-
tation  of  the  specific  security  measures  outlined  in  their  facility/vessel  security 
plans and they must be knowledgeable in emergency preparedness, the conduct 
of  security  audits,  and  security  exercises.  In  addition,  facility  security  officers 
must  have  training  in  security  assessment  methodologies;  current  security 
threats  and  patterns;  recognizing  and  detecting  dangerous  substances  and  de-
vices,  recognizing  characteristics  and  behavioral  patterns  of  persons  who  are 
likely  to  threaten  security;  and  techniques  used  to  circumvent  security  meas-
ures.

Increase  Operational  Presence.  Third,  we  seek  to  better  protect  critical  mari-
time  infrastructure  and  improve  our  ability  to  respond  to  suspect  activities  by  in-
creasing our operational presence in ports, coastal zones and beyond,—to implement 
a layered security posture, a defense-in-depth. Our collective efforts to increase oper-
ational  presence  in  ports  and  coastal  zones  focus  not  only  on  adding  more  people, 
boats  and  ships  to  our  force  structures,  but  making  the  employment  of  those  re-
sources  more  effective  through  the  application  of  technology,  information  sharing, 
and intelligence support. 

Improve Response and Recovery Posture. Finally, we are improving our abil-
ity to respond to and aid in recovery if there were an actual terrorist attack. Under-
standing  the  challenge  of  defending  26,000  miles  of  navigable  waterways  and  361 
ports  against  every  conceivable  threat  at  every  possible  time,  we  are  also  aggres-
sively  working  to  improve  our  response  capabilities  and  readiness.  While  many  of 
the increases in MDA and operational presence augment our collective response and 
recovery  posture,  we  must  also  incorporate  initiatives  that  will  increase  our  ability 
to  adequately  manage  operations  and  coordinate  resources  during  maritime  threat 
response or recovery operations. 

The Coast Guard is implementing the new National Response Plan across all op-
erations.  The  Incident  Command  System  is  our  mandated  crisis  management  sys-
tem,  and  we  have  years  of  practical  experience  in  its  use.  At  the  local  level,  each 
port  is  ready  with  port-specific  and  even  sub-area  specific,  response  plans.  All  law 
enforcement  agencies,  public  service  providers,  and  port  stakeholders  have  partici-
pated in the plan development process. 

The  Coast  Guard  has  confidence  that  if  a  maritime  transportation  security  inci-
dent (TSI) should occur in one of our ports, the local responders (Coast Guard Sector 
Commander  or  Captain  of  the  Port,  other  federal  agencies,  state  and  local  authori-
ties, and partners in industry) will immediately react with mitigation, response, and 
recovery  activities  in  that  port  and  region.  At  the  same  time,  we  are  continuing  to 
refine  tools  and  analysis  to  aid  senior  leadership  in  their  ability  to  rapidly  respond 
to a crisis, minimize damage, and aid in recovery operations. 
Conclusion 

After  experiencing  the  most  horrific  act  of  terrorism  on  U.S.  soil  on  9/11,  all  sec-
tors  of  the  maritime  community  rallied  together  to  strengthen  the  security  of  the 
maritime transportation system. The tremendous successes in this endeavor is due, 
in large part, to the cooperation and prompt measures taken by government and in-
dustry  working  together  as  partners.  Much  work  remains  to  be  done  to  reduce 
America’s  vulnerabilities  to  terrorism  and  other  maritime  security  threats  but  with 
the continued support of the Congress and Administration, I know that we will suc-
ceed in delivering the robust maritime safety and security America expects and de-
serves well into the 21st Century. 

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today.  I  will  be  happy  to  answer  any 

questions you may have.

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Mr. Skinner?

GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  be

I  would  like  to  summarize  three  issues  from  my  prepared  state-
ment  that  I  have  submitted  for  the  record.  One,  the  Department’s 
effort  to  detect  radioactive  material  in  cargo  security;  challenges 
facing the Coast Guard; and the Department’s Port Security Grant 
Program. 

Concerning  the  detection  of  radioactive  materials,  as  this  Com-
mittee knows, ABC News reported that twice it successfully smug-
gled  depleted  uranium  into  the  country.  The  depleted  uranium  ar-
rived in ocean-going cargo containers that were shipped from Indo-
nesia  and  Turkey.  In  both  cases,  the  containers  were  targeted  as 
high  risk  for  additional  screening,  but,  nonetheless,  were  allowed 
entry without detection. 

In September of 2004, we issued a classified report. We cited sev-
eral  weaknesses  that  allowed  this  to  happen.  The  Department  has 
since  enhanced  its  ability  to  screen  targeted  containers  for  radio-
active  emissions  by  deploying  more  sensitive  technology  at  its  sea-
ports,  revising  protocols  and  procedures,  and  improving  the  train-
ing of its personnel. 

At  the  request  of  four  congressional  committees,  we  initiated  a 
follow-up  audit  to  determine  whether  the  Department  had  imple-
mented  our  recommendations  and  to  examine  other  technologies 
that could increase the Department’s radiation-detection capability. 
Concerning  Coast  Guard  challenges,  in  September  2004  we  re-
ported  that  the  Coast  Guard’s  willingness  to  work  hard  and  long 
hours,  use  innovative  tactics,  and  work  closely  with  other  depart-
mental  components  allowed  it  to  achieve  its  mission-performance 
goals.  However,  to  sustain  its  mission  performance,  the  Coast 
Guard  faces  significant  barriers;  most  importantly,  the  deterio-
rating readiness of its fleet vessels. 

The  workload  demands  of  the  Coast  Guard  will  only  continue  to 
increase  as  it  implements  the  Maritime  Transportation  Security 
Act, MTSA. It must conduct risk assessments of all vessels and fa-
cilities  on  or  near  the  water,  develop  national  and  area  maritime 
transportation  security  plans,  and  improve  port  facility  and  vessel 
security  plans.  In  addition,  growing  homeland  security  demands, 
such as added port and coastal security patrols, increase the Coast 
Guard’s  operating  tempo.  The  Coast  Guard  reported  that  mission 
sustainment  is  at  risk  due  to  the  cutters  and  aircraft  that  are 
aging,  obsolete,  and  require  replacement.  Currently,  the  Coast 
Guard  has  experienced  serious  cracking  in  the  hulls  of  its  110-foot 
cutters  and  the  engine  power  loss  on  its  HH–65  Dolphin  heli-
copters. These problems adversely affect the Coast Guard’s mission 
readiness and, ultimately, mission performance. 

Finally,  concerning  Port  Security  Grants,  today  the  Transpor-
tation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the De-
partment  of  Transportation’s  Maritime  Administration  have  col-
laborated  to  award  over  $560  million  for  over  1,200  projects.  This 
does not include, however, the most recent round of grants, totaling 
$141 million, which the Department announced this past week. 

In January of this year, we reported on several important issues 
relating  to  strategic  direction,  priority-setting,  and  general  admin-
istration of the program. 

First, the program’s strategic effectiveness is hindered because it 
is  attempting  to  reconcile  three  competing  requirements  or  ap-

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  11:29 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025728 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\25728.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

proaches:  the  competitive  program  mandated  by  Congress  through 
its  appropriations,  MTSA’s  grant  authority,  which  was  not  funded 
through  appropriations,  and  risk-based  decision-making.  These 
competitive approaches were clouding the direction of the program. 
Second,  the  program  did  not  have  the  benefit  of  critical  infra-
structure-protection  information  now  being  developed  by  the  De-
partment’s  Information  Analysis  and  Infrastructure  Protection  Di-
rectorate.  Consequently,  Port  Security  Grants  were  awarded  with-
out basic data about our national port-security priorities. 

Third,  grant  award  decisions  were  made  with  the  intent  of  ex-
pending  all  available  funding  and  spreading  funds  to  as  many  ap-
plicants  as  possible.  The  Department  funded  projects  despite  dubi-
ous  scores  by  its  evaluators,  raising  questions  about  the  merits  of 
many  of  the  projects.  It  appeared  that  headquarters  and  field  re-
viewers did not always share a common understanding of program 
objectives  or  eligibility  criteria.  In  addition,  the  program  trans-
ferred  82  projects  that  were  not  funded,  valued  at  $75  million,  to 
the  Department’s  Urban  Area  Security  Initiative,  despite  pre-
viously determining that those projects did not merit funding. 

Another  dilemma  for  the  program  related  to  the  circumstances 
under  which  private  entities  might  obtain  grant  funding.  DHS  did 
not  have  a  formal  policy  to  govern  financial  assistance  to  private 
entities, including those that own and operate high-risk port facili-
ties.  Some  of  the  grants  to  private  companies  were  within  their  fi-
nancial  means,  and  many  were  for  basic  security  measures  that 
should have been considered as normal cost of doing business. 

Furthermore,  grant  recipients  had  spent  only  a  small  portion  of 
their awards. Of the $515 million awarded between June 2002 and 
December  2003,  including  the  $75  million  provided  under  the  De-
partment’s Urban Area Security Initiative, grant recipients had ex-
pended only $107 million, or 21 percent of their awards, as of Sep-
tember  30th,  2004.  We  determined  that  many  of  the  recipients 
were simply not prepared to put their grant funds to use. Further-
more,  we  determined  that  the  Department  did  not  have  sufficient 
resources  to  monitor  the  progress,  or  lack  thereof,  of  individual 
projects. 

The  Department  generally  agreed  with  our  recommendations  to 
improve  the  design,  management,  and  oversight  of  the  program. 
The  Department  advised  us  that  it  intended  to  use  a  new  risk-
based formula to award the $150 million budgeted for Port Security 
Grants during 2005. 

We are now studying how the Department has modified the pro-
gram,  particularly  the  criteria  that  it  would  use  to  make  grant 
award  decisions  and  whether  those  modifications  satisfy  our  rec-
ommendations. 

Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Co-Chairman,  Members,  this  concludes  my 

remarks. I’ll be happy to answer any questions you may have.

United  States,  maritime  security  challenges  facing  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  (USCG), 
and the Port Security Grant Program. These areas involve major components of the 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its wide-ranging operations. Each has 
been the subject of oversight by the OIG and my comments are drawn from our re-
ports, which are available on the OIG website at www.dhs.gov/oig. 
Preventing Terrorist Weapons From Entering the United States 

Since September 11, 2001, the Department of Homeland Security’s Bureau of Cus-
toms and Border Protection’s (CBP) priority mission is detecting and preventing ter-
rorists  and  terrorist  weapons  from  entering  the  United  States.  A  major  component 
of  its  priority  mission  is  to  ensure  that  oceangoing  cargo  containers  arriving  at  the 
seaports of entry are not used to smuggle illegal and dangerous contraband. To test 
controls  over  importing  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  ABC  News  was  successful  in 
two  attempts  at  smuggling  depleted  uranium  into  the  country.  On  September  11, 
2002,  ABC  News  reported  that  a  15-pound  cylinder  of  depleted  uranium  was 
shipped  from  Europe  to  the  U.S.  undetected  by  CBP.  On  September  11,  2003,  ABC 
News reported that the same cylinder was smuggled to the U.S. from Jakarta, Indo-
nesia, again undetected. 

In  the  first  smuggling  event,  ABC  News  reported  that  a  steel  pipe  containing  a 
15-pound  cylinder  of  depleted  uranium,  which  was  shielded  with  lead,  was  placed 
in a suitcase and accompanied by ABC News reporters by rail from Austria to Tur-
key.  In  Istanbul,  Turkey,  the  suitcase  was  placed  inside  an  ornamental  chest  that 
was  crated  and  nailed  shut.  The  crate  containing  the  suitcase  was  then  placed 
alongside  crates  of  huge  vases  and  Turkish  horse  carts  in  a  large  metal  shipping 
container,  and  then  loaded  onto  a  ship  that  left  Istanbul.  Based  on  data  contained 
in the Automated Targeting System, the crate was targeted as high-risk for screen-
ing by the U.S. Customs Service (Customs). ABC News broadcast on September 11, 
2002,  that  Customs  failed  to  detect  the  depleted  uranium  carried  from  Europe  to 
the United States. 

During  the  second  smuggling  event,  ABC  News  placed  the  same  cylinder  of  de-
pleted uranium into a suitcase, and then placed the suitcase into a teak trunk. The 
trunk, along with other furniture, was loaded into a container in Jakarta, Indonesia, 
and  then  transshipped  to  the  U.S.  from  Tanjung  Pelepas,  Malaysia.  This  shipment 
was also targeted as high-risk for screening and subsequently inspected by CBP per-
sonnel, but was then allowed to proceed from the port by truck. 

In a classified September 2004 report, Effectiveness of Customs and Border Protec-
tion’s  Procedures  to  Detect  Uranium  in  Two  Smuggling  Incidents,  we  cited  several 
weaknesses  that  occurred  at  the  time  of  the  two  incidents  that  made  the  container 
inspection process ineffective. The protocols and procedures that CBP personnel fol-
lowed  at  the  time  of  the  two  smuggling  incidents  were  not  adequate  to  detect  the 
depleted uranium. CBP has since enhanced its ability to screen targeted containers 
for radioactive emissions by deploying more sensitive technology at its seaports, re-
vising protocols and procedures, and improving training of CBP personnel. 

At the request of four congressional committees, we recently initiated a follow-up 
audit  to  determine  the  status  of  CBP’s  implementation  of  the  recommendations 
made in our September 2004 report. In addition, we will review other relevant tech-
nologies  and  implementation  plans  recommended  by  entities  associated  with  CBP’s 
efforts  to  increase  the  detection  capability  of  the  radiation  portal  monitors  that  are 
deployed domestically and internationally. 
Maritime Security 

The  Coast  Guard’s  willingness  to  work  hard  and  long  hours,  use  innovative  tac-
tics,  and  work  through  partnerships  in  close  inter-agency  cooperation  has  allowed 
it  to  achieve  mission  performance  results  goals.  However,  to  improve  and  sustain 
its  mission  performance  in  the  future,  the  Coast  Guard  faces  significant  barriers, 
most  importantly  the  deteriorating  readiness  of  its  fleet  assets.  The  Coast  Guard 
faces  three  major  barriers  to  improving  and  sustaining  its  readiness  to  perform  its 
legacy missions:

1. The lack of a comprehensive and fully defined performance management sys-
tem  impedes  the  Coast  Guard’s  ability  to  gauge  its  performance,  allocate  re-
sources effectively, and target areas for improved performance.
2.  The  workload  demands  on  the  Coast  Guard  will  continue  to  increase  as  it 
implements  the  Maritime  Transportation  Security  Act  of  2002  (MTSA).  This 
complex  work  requires  experienced  and  trained  personnel;  however,  the  Coast 
Guard  has  in  recent  years  suffered  from  declining  experience  levels  among  its 
personnel.

22

3.  Sustaining  a  high  operating  tempo  due  to  growing  homeland  security  de-
mands, such as added port, waterway, and coastal security patrols, will tax the 
Coast Guard’s infrastructure including its aging cutter and aircraft fleet.

The  lack  of  a  comprehensive  and  fully  defined  performance  management  system 
impedes the Coast Guard’s ability to gauge its performance, allocate resources effec-
tively,  and  target  areas  for  improved  performance.  The  Coast  Guard  has  yet  to  de-
fine a performance management system that includes all the input, output, and out-
comes  needed  to  gauge  results  and  target  performance  improvements,  balance  its 
missions, and ensure the capacity and readiness to respond to future crises or major 
terrorist attacks. For example, for search and rescue, the number of mariners in dis-
tress saved is a good indicator of outcome; however, resource hours under-represent 
the  effort  put  into  this  mission  by  omitting  the  many  hours  of  watch  standing  at 
stations.  Without  more  complete  information,  the  Coast  Guard  has  limited  ability 
to identify and target cost effective improvements to mission performance. 

The  workload  demands  on  the  Coast  Guard  will  continue  to  increase  as  it  imple-
ments  the  MSTA.  Under  MTSA,  the  Coast  Guard  must  conduct  risk  assessments 
of all vessels and facilities on or near the water; develop national and area maritime 
transportation  security  plans;  and  approve  port,  facility,  and  vessel  security  plans. 
This  complex  work  requires  experienced  and  trained  personnel,  presenting  a  major 
challenge  for  the  Coast  Guard,  which  has  in  recent  years  suffered  from  declining 
experience levels among its personnel. Since the Coast Guard largely relies on expe-
rienced  senior  personnel  to  coach  and  train  junior  personnel  and  new  recruits  on 
the job, mission performance is at risk. 

In addition to implementing MTSA, growing homeland security demands, such as 
added port, waterway, and coastal security patrols, result in a continued high oper-
ating  tempo.  Sustaining  this  high  operating  tempo  will  be  a  major  challenge  for 
Coast Guard personnel and will tax its infrastructure, especially its aged cutter and 
aircraft  fleet.  The  Coast  Guard  reported  that  mission  sustainment  is  at  risk  due  to 
cutters  and  aircraft  that  are  aging,  technologically  obsolete,  and  require  replace-
ment and modernization. Currently, the Coast Guard is experiencing serious crack-
ing in the hulls of the 110 foot cutters and engine power loss on the HH–65 Dolphin 
helicopters,  resulting  in  operating  restrictions.  These  problems  adversely  affect  the 
Coast Guard’s mission readiness and ultimately mission performance. 
The Port Security Grant Program 

The Department’s Port Security Grant Program is designed to reduce the vulner-
ability  of  American  ports  to  potential  terrorist  attacks  by  enhancing  facility  and 
operational  security.  The  Transportation  Security  Administration,  the  U.S.  Coast 
Guard,  and  the  Department  of  Transportation’s  Maritime  Administration  have  col-
laborated to award over $560 million for over 1,200 projects. My office reviewed the 
design and goals of the program, the roles and responsibilities of participating agen-
cies,  and  the  grant  evaluation  and  selection  process.  The  bulk  of  our  analysis  fo-
cused  on  grant  award  decisions  in  rounds  two  and  three.  The  results  of  our  review 
are  discussed  in  our  January  28,  2005  final  report,  Review  of  the  Port  Security 
Grant Program (#OIG–05–10). We identified several important issues relating to the 
strategic  direction  of  the  program,  the  program’s  support  of  national  infrastructure 
protection priorities, and the general administration of the program. I would like to 
briefly talk about those results. 

First,  the  program’s  strategic  effectiveness  is  hindered  mainly  because  it  is  at-
tempting  to  reconcile  three  competing  approaches:  the  competitive  program  man-
dated by Congress, MTSA’s grant authority, and risk-based decision making. These 
competing  approaches  are  clouding  the  direction  of  the  program.  The  program  is 
under pressure to help defray the costs of the MTSA security mandates that broadly 
affect  the  maritime  industry.  MTSA  included  a  grant  authority  intended  to  equi-
tably  distribute  funds  for  this  purpose,  but  the  appropriations  legislation  did  not 
fund  the  MTSA  port  security  grant  program  and  required  a  competitive  grant  pro-
gram focused on securing national critical seaports. However, the resulting program 
must  base  award  decisions  on  the  universe  of  applications  submitted—which  may 
or may not include the most critical needs. In addition, the evaluation and selection 
process  emphasized  awarding  funds  to  as  many  applicants  as  possible.  Hence,  the 
program  attempted  to  balance  the  competitive  program  that  objectively  evaluates 
the quality of the applications with the need to broadly disperse funds to assist with 
MTSA  compliance,  while  at  the  same  time  incorporating  risk-based  eligibility  cri-
teria and evaluation tools to prioritize projects. 

Second,  the  program  did  not  have  the  benefit  of  national  key  asset  and  critical 
infrastructure protection information now being developed by the Information Anal-
ysis  and  Infrastructure  Protection  (IAIP)  directorate.  Program  administrators  and 
IAIP,  which  is  responsible  for  developing  strategies  for  protecting  the  Nation’s  crit-

ical  infrastructure,  did  not  collaborate  to  integrate  the  program  with  broader  na-
tional  security  initiatives.  Thus,  port  security  grant  award  decisions  were  made 
without sufficient information about our national priorities. 

Third, grant award decisions were made with the intent of expending all available 
funding and spreading funds to as many applicants as possible. The program funded 
projects  despite  dubious  scores  by  its  evaluators  against  key  criteria,  raising  ques-
tions  about  the  merits  of  258  projects  costing  $67  million.  It  appeared  that  head-
quarters and field reviewers did not share a common understanding of program ob-
jectives  or  eligibility  criteria.  Frequently,  they  did  not  agree  about  the  eligibility  or 
merit  of  projects  and  did  not  consistently  document  their  rationale  for  recom-
mending  or  not  recommending  funding.  We  pointed  out  the  need  for  the  program 
to  look  more  closely  at  the  first  three  criteria  (whether  the  grant  proposal  was  in 
an  area  of  high  risk,  addressed  a  critical  security  need/vulnerability,  and  provided 
high  risk  reduction),  which  were  well  conceived  and  should  have  carried  more 
weight. 

In  addition,  the  program  forwarded  an  additional  82  projects  to  the  Office  of  Do-
mestic  Preparedness  to  be  funded  at  a  cost  of  $75  million  under  the  Urban  Area 
Security Initiative, despite previously determining that these projects did not merit 
funding. 

Another dilemma for the program is the question of where the private sector’s re-
sponsibility  for  preventing  terrorism  ends  and  where  the  Federal  Government’s  re-
sponsibility  begins.  At  the  time  of  our  report,  DHS  did  not  have  a  formal  policy  to 
provide financial assistance to private entities, a group that includes those that own 
and  operate  high  risk  facilities.  Even  though  private  entities  have  applied  for  and 
received  substantial  funding,  we  did  not  conclude  that  the  program  should  limit 
funding to the private sector per se. However, some of the grants to private compa-
nies were within the financial reach of the applicants and many were for basic secu-
rity measures that should have been considered normal costs of doing business. For 
example,  some  of  the  projects  were  for  anti-theft  purposes  and  not  related  to  ter-
rorist attack prevention or deterrence. 

Furthermore,  after  three  rounds,  recipients  spent  only  a  small  portion  of  the  en-
tire amount awarded. Of the $515 million awarded between June 2002 and Decem-
ber  2003,  including  $75  million  provided  under  the  Office  for  Domestic  Prepared-
ness’ Urban Area Security Initiative, grant recipients had expended only $106.9 mil-
lion,  or  21  percent  of  total  program  awards  as  of  September  30,  2004.  As  a  result, 
the  majority  of  projects  had  not  been  completed  and  the  program  had  not  yet 
achieved  its  intended  results  in  the  form  of  actual  improvements  to  port  security. 
This brings us to the status of our recommendations. In response to our draft re-
port,  DHS  concurred  with  11  of  our  12  recommendations.  In  our  final  report,  we 
strongly  encouraged  DHS  to  fully  implement  our  recommendations  before  pro-
ceeding with the next round of port security grants. DHS’ Office of State and Local 
Government  Coordination  and  Preparedness  (SLGCP)  received  $150  million  in  the 
FY 2005 budget for round five of the Port Security Grant Program. SLGCP officials 
informed us that they were going to make substantive changes to the design of the 
program  to  make  it  more  risk-based,  and  while  it  appears  they  have,  we  have  not 
evaluated the effect of these changes. 

We  recently  received  DHS’  action  plan,  which  discusses  corrective  actions  taken 
and planned in response to our recommendations. The action plan generally appears 
to be responsive to our recommendations. For example:

• We identified numerous projects within ports not on the list of strategic or con-
trolled  ports.  The  program  developed  and  implemented  a  funding  distribution 
model that targeted 66 ports as eligible under the program.
• We noted the lack of a policy for funding private sector projects. The action plan 
refers to a decision by the Secretary that private entities may apply for a grant, 
but must provide matching funds of 50 percent.
• Program administrators did not collaborate with IAIP on broader national secu-
rity initiatives. SLGCP is taking steps to improve information sharing with, and 
participation of, IAIP in the selection and evaluation process.

However, we are also reviewing additional information supporting the action plan. 
In addition, we have not had the opportunity to review guidance that will be issued 
for those SLGCP, USCG, TSA, CBP, IAIP, and MARAD personnel who will be eval-
uating  projects.  The  revised  grant  application  package  was  just  released  this  past 
week.  We  are  studying  how  DHS  has  modified  the  program—particularly  the  cri-
teria program administrators will use and how they will apply it during the evalua-
tion process—and whether those modifications satisfy our recommendations. We ex-
pect to communicate this information to SLGCP in the near future.

STATEMENT  OF  MARGARET  T.  WRIGHTSON,  DIRECTOR,
ISSUES,  U.S.

HOMELAND 
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE 
Ms.  WRIGHTSON.  Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Inouye, 

SECURITY  AND 

JUSTICE 

and other distinguished Members. 

I’m pleased to be here today to discuss the Nation’s efforts to im-

prove maritime and seaport security. 

Since the terrorist attack of September 11th, GAO has responded 
to  numerous  requests  for  reports  and  testimonies  on  this  issue.  In 
fact, in the past few years we’ve issued more than 20 products, all 
of which contained recommendations. 

My statement today covers a wide range of that work, but, in the 
interest of time, I’m going to highlight only our major findings and 
conclusions. 

First,  since  September  11th,  the  Federal  Government  and  port 
stakeholders have taken extensive actions to improve port security. 
Together,  these  actions  have  helped  to  improve  security  in  three 
ways:  identifying  and  reducing  vulnerabilities  of  potential  targets, 
helping  to  secure  the  flow  of  containers  to  port  gateways,  and  im-
proving  maritime  domain  awareness  so  that  stakeholders  have  an 
informed  view  of  port  activities  through  intelligence,  information 
sharing,  and  new  technologies  to  identify  and  respond  to  threats. 
Second, while it may have been necessary to move quickly at the 
outset, attempting so much so fast has resulted in a range of prob-
lems  that  should  be  corrected,  and  soon.  These  problems  can  be 
grouped into three main categories: concerns about faulty program 
design  and  implementation,  concerns  about  inadequate  coordina-
tion,  and  concerns  about  maintaining  the  financial  support  needed 
to continue implementing the security enhancements. 

Last, as it becomes clear that the price of improved port security 
will  be  measured  in  billions,  we  must  develop  better  mechanisms 
for  assessing  progress  and  assuring  that  resources  are  focused  on

the  most  important  priorities.  Approaching  4  years  after  the  ter-
rorist attacks, performance measures to define outcomes and meas-
ure  progress  have  not  been  implemented,  nor  is  there  a  robust 
framework  for  systematically  managing  risk.  A  sustainable  strat-
egy for maritime security requires both. 

Turning to our detailed findings, given the scope and complexity 
of  the  programs,  and  the  speed  with  which  they  were  rolled  out, 
it  is  not  surprising  that  we  have  found  a  host  of  problems.  While 
some  of  these  may  be  resolved  with  time  as  the  programs  mature, 
others are more challenging. 

The  first  challenge  is  the  failure  of  many  of  these  programs  to 
incorporate  necessary  planning.  For  example,  our  review  showed 
that  TWIC,  C–TPAT,  CSI,  Megaport,  AIS,  and  the  Port  Security 
Assessment  and  Compliance  Program  all  experienced  major  plan-
ning problems, ranging from inadequate or nonexistent human cap-
ital,  projects,  or  strategic  planning,  to  faulty  project  management, 
such as a lack of clear timeframes, milestones, and risk mitigation. 
Until such planning elements are incorporated, there will be too lit-
tle  assurance  that  program  results  will  be  delivered  on  time  and 
on target. 

Inadequate coordination is the second area to highlight. Unfortu-
nately,  the  list  of  programs  with  coordination  problems  is  as  long 
as the list for planning problems, yet establishing a viable port-se-
curity  regime  cannot  be  accomplished  with  agencies  at  the  federal 
level that are working in stovepipes or by the Federal Government 
alone as Congressman Ruppersberger ably stated earlier. 

There  is  perhaps  no  better  way  to  highlight  what  can  happen 
when  coordination  breaks  down  than  the  delayed  attempt  to  de-
velop the Transportation Worker Identification Credential. 

TSA  began  TWIC  in  2002,  while  it  was  part  of  DOT.  At  that 
time, TSA said the first cards would be issued in 2004. We are now 
nearly  halfway  through  2005,  and  TWIC  is  still  in  the  prototype 
phase,  with  critical  policy  decisions  still  to  be  made  that  are  as 
basic as who will be eligible to receive the card. 

Part of TSA’s problems can be traced to breakdowns in coordina-
tion  between  TSA  and  DHS.  Moreover,  outside  DHS,  TSA  has 
failed to sustain the support of port stakeholders who feel excluded. 
Without internal and external support and agreement, and, I might 
add,  a  comprehensive  plan  for  managing  this  program,  which  does 
not  now  appear  to  be  in  place,  the  program  is  at  risk  of  further 
delays, increased costs, and less-than-satisfactory outcomes. 

Before concluding, two additional matters are worth mentioning. 
First,  notwithstanding  the  effort  and  resources  represented  by 
these  programs  and  the  people  at  this  table,  it  is  difficult,  if  not 
impossible,  to  know  how  far  we  have  progressed  in  making  ports 
more secure. 

One reason is a lack of overall goals and measures. For example, 
although  the  Coast  Guard  regularly  reports  how  well  it  is  doing 
rescuing  mariners  in  distress,  it  is  still  struggling  to  develop  and 
implement a performance measure for port-security activities. 

Second, we cannot afford to protect everything against every risk. 
More care must be taken to prioritize resources toward the greatest 
risk.

26

Notwithstanding some progress, much remains to be done before 
a  common  framework  for  risk  management  is  systematically  ap-
plied  to  policy  and  resource  allocation  decisions  in  DHS,  let  alone 
the Federal Government. 

In  conclusion,  urgency  in  the  wake  of  9/11  may  help  to  ration-
alize the mistakes and missteps described today; however, the need 
for quick action at the start should not be used to justify poor plan-
ning and management today. In the final analysis, the race to bet-
ter security must be run as a marathon, not a sprint. In port secu-
rity, as in homeland security, we’re ready for midcourse corrections, 
including,  we  hope,  the  expeditious  implementation  of  GAO’s  rec-
ommendations  and  a  closer  focus  on  goals,  measures,  and  risk 
management.  This  is  because  lasting  success  depends  less  well  on 
how  quickly  the  programs  were  begun  than  on  how  carefully  they 
are carried out. 

Mr.  Chairman,  that  concludes  my  statement.  I  hope  we  engage 

in a dialogue about these really important issues. 

[The prepared statement of Ms. Wrightson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MARGARET T. WRIGHTSON, DIRECTOR, HOMELAND 
SECURITY AND JUSTICE ISSUES, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE 

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: 
I  am  pleased  to  be  here  today  to  discuss  the  Nation’s  efforts  to  improve  seaport 
security.  More  than  3  years  after  the  terrorist  attacks  of  September  11,  2001,  sea-
port  security  continues  to  be  a  major  concern  for  the  Nation.  For  example,  many 
seaport areas are inherently vulnerable, given their size, easy accessibility by water 
and  land,  large  numbers  of  potential  targets,  and  proximity  to  urban  areas.  Also, 
the  large  cargo  volumes  passing  through  seaports,  such  as  containers  destined  for 
further  shipment  by  other  modes  of  transportation  such  as  rail  or  truck,  also  rep-
resent  a  potential  conduit  for  terrorists  to  smuggle  weapons  of  mass  destruction  or 
other dangerous materials into the United States. The potential consequences of the 
risks  created  by  these  vulnerabilities  are  significant  as  the  Nation’s  economy  relies 
on  an  expeditious  flow  of  goods  through  seaports.  A  successful  attack  on  a  seaport 
could result in a dramatic slowdown in the supply system, with consequences in the 
billions of dollars. 

Much has been set in motion to address these risks in the wake of the September 
11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Both Congress and the Administration have been active, 
through  legislation,  presidential  directives,  and  international  agreements,  in  en-
hancing seaport security. Key agencies, such as the Coast Guard, the Customs Serv-
ice,  and  the  Transportation  Security  Administration  (TSA),  have  been  reorganized 
under the new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and tasked with numerous 
responsibilities  designed  to  strengthen  seaport  security.  Many  of  these  tasks  were 
required by the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA).1

My  testimony  today  draws  primarily  on  the  work  we  have  done  in  responding  to 
congressional requests for information and analysis about the Nation’s homeland se-
curity efforts (see app. I for a list of recent reports and testimonies we have issued). 
We conducted our work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing 
standards, and the scope and methodology for this work can be found in the respec-
tive  products.  Over  the  course  of  completing  this  work,  we  have  made  a  number  of 
recommendations  for  specific  agencies,  which  can  be  found  in  appendix  II.  While 
this  body  of  work  does  not  cover  every  program  or  action  that  has  been  taken,  it 
does  encompass  a  wide  range  of  these  actions.  My  testimony  will  (1)  provide  an 
overview of the types of actions taken by the Federal Government and other stake-
holders to address seaport security, (2) describe the main challenges encountered in 
taking  these  actions,  and  (3)  describe  what  tools  and  approaches  may  be  useful  in 
charting a course for future actions to enhance security. 
Summary 

Seaports are vulnerable on many fronts and the actions taken to secure them can 
be  divided  into  three  main  categories:  reducing  vulnerabilities  of  specific  targets 
within seaports, making the cargo flowing through these seaport gateways more se-
cure, and developing what is called ‘‘maritime domain awareness’’—a sufficiently in-

formed  view  of  maritime  activities  by  stakeholders  involved  in  security  to  quickly 
identify  and  respond  to  emergencies,  unusual  patterns  or  events,  and  matters  of 
particular interest. Within each category, several actions have been taken or are un-
derway.  For  example,  assessments  of  potential  targets  have  been  completed  at  55 
of  the  Nation’s  most  economically  and  militarily  strategic  seaports,  and  more  than 
9,000 vessels and over 3,000 facilities have developed security plans and have been 
reviewed  by  the  Coast  Guard.  Customs  inspectors  have  been  placed  at  some  over-
seas  seaports  and  partnerships  struck  up  with  some  private  sector  stakeholders  to 
help ensure that the cargo and containers arriving at U.S. seaports are free of weap-
ons of mass destruction (WMD) or a radiological ‘‘dirty bomb.’’ New assets are budg-
eted and are coming online, including new Coast Guard boats and cutters and com-
munication  systems.  Finally,  new  information-sharing  networks  and  command 
structures  have  been  created  to  allow  more  coordinated  responses  and  increase 
awareness of activities going on in the maritime domain. Some of these efforts have 
been  completed  and  others  are  ongoing;  overall,  the  amount  of  effort  has  been  con-
siderable. 

The  efforts  we  have  reviewed  over  the  past  3  years,  many  of  which  were  quickly 
implemented  to  address  pressing  security  needs,  have  encountered  challenges  that 
could significantly affect their success. Some of these challenges are likely to be re-
solved with time, but some reflect greater difficulty and therefore merit more atten-
tion. The more complex challenges take three main forms:

• Program  design  and  implementation:  Some  agencies  have  failed  to  design  pro-
grams and planning components, such as human capital plans and performance 
measures, that are necessary to successfully implement their programs and en-
sure they are effective. For example, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
started  implementation  of  two  key  container  supply-chain-security  initiatives 
before taking adequate steps to develop plans and strategies to effectively man-
age  critical  aspects  of  the  programs  such  as  human  capital  and  achievement  of 
program objectives.

• Coordinating security efforts with stakeholders: Many private sector companies 
and governmental agencies are involved in seaport security efforts, and in some 
cases progress has been hampered because of difficulties in communication and 
coordination  between  parties.  For  example,  deadlines  in  the  development  of  an 
identification  card  for  transportation  workers  have  been  missed  due  in  part  to 
a lack of communication and coordination between TSA and DHS.

• Funding  security  improvements:  Economic  constraints,  such  as  declining  reve-
nues  and  increased  security  costs,  make  it  difficult  to  provide  and  sustain  the 
funding necessary to continue implementing security measures and activities by 
maritime  stakeholders  including  the  Federal  Government.  Consequently,  many 
stakeholders  rely  heavily  on  the  Federal  Government  for  assistance,  and  re-
quests for federal grant funding far outstrip the funding amounts available. For 
example,  although  more  than  $560  million  in  grants  has  been  awarded  to  sea-
port  stakeholders  since  2002  under  federal  grant  programs  for  implementation 
of  security  measures  and  activities,  this  amount  has  met  only  a  fraction  of  the 
amount requested by these stakeholders.

As actions to enhance homeland security continue, and as it becomes clearer that 
the price of these actions will be measured in the billions of dollars, it is likely that 
increasing  attention  will  turn  to  assessing  the  progress  made  in  securing  seaports 
and  determine  where  future  actions  and  funds  should  be  allocated  to  further  en-
hance  security.  Although  there  is  widespread  agreement  that  actions  taken  so  far 
have led to a heightened awareness of the need for security and an enhanced ability 
to  identify  and  respond  to  many  security  threats,  assessing  the  degree  of  progress 
in  making  the  Nation  more  secure  is  difficult.  Thus  far,  seaport  security  actions—
and  homeland  security  activities  in  general—lack  performance  measures  to  define 
what  these  activities  are  intended  to  achieve  and  measure  progress  toward  these 
goals.  As  Congress  and  the  Nation  continue  to  evaluate  how  much  security  is 
enough,  more  attention  on  defining  these  goals  and  measures  will  likely  be  needed 
by  stakeholders.  Doing  so  is  all  the  more  important  because,  as  groups  such  as  the 
9/11  Commission  have  pointed  out,  no  amount  of  money  can  totally  insulate  sea-
ports  from  attack  by  a  well-funded  and  determined  enemy.  These  realities  suggest 
that  the  future  focus  in  applying  resources  and  efforts  also  needs  to  incorporate  an 
approach  to  identify  and  manage  risk—that  is,  on  assessing  critical  infrastructure, 
determining  what  is  most  at  risk,  and  applying  sound  measures  designed  to  make 
cost-effective use of resources and funding.

Background 

The  vast  U.S.  maritime  system  contains  more  than  300  seaports  and  3,700  cargo 
and  passenger  terminals.  These  seaports  dot  not  only  our  seacoasts,  but  also  major 
lakes  and  rivers  (see  fig.  1).  Much  of  the  Nation’s  commercial  maritime  activities, 
however,  are  concentrated  in  about  a  dozen  major  seaports,  such  as  Los  Angeles/
Long Beach, New York/New Jersey, and Houston.

The Nation’s seaports are economic engines and a key part of the national defense 
system.  More  than  95  percent  of  the  Nation’s  non-North  American  foreign  trade 
(and  100  percent  of  certain  commodities,  such  as  foreign  oil)  arrives  by  ship.  Cargo 
containers,  approximately  7  million  of  which  entered  the  country  in  2002,  are  cen-
tral to an efficient transportation network because they can be quickly shifted from 
ships  to  trains  and  trucks  and  back  again.  Because  of  these  efficiencies,  the  U.S. 
and world economies have become increasingly reliant on cargo containers to trans-
port  their  goods.  With  regard  to  national  security,  the  Departments  of  Defense  and 
Transportation  have  designated  17  U.S.  seaports  as  strategic  because  they  are  nec-
essary  for  use  in  the  event  of  a  major  military  deployment.  Thirteen  of  them  are 
commercial seaports. 

While  the  terrorist  attacks  of  September  11,  2001,  did  not  involve  seaports,  they 
called  attention  to  ways  in  which  seaports  represent  an  attractive  and  vulnerable 
terrorist  target.  Various  studies  have  pointed  out  that  significant  disruptions  could 
result from a seaport-related attack. For example, the Brookings Institution has es-
timated  that  costs  associated  with  U.S.  seaport  closures  resulting  from  a  detonated 
weapon of mass destruction could amount to $1 trillion. The firm of Booz, Allen, and 
Hamilton  studied  the  potential  cost  of  discovering  an  undetonated  weapon  of  mass 
destruction  at  a  U.S.  seaport  and  placed  the  cost  of  a  12-day  closure  of  seaports  at 
approximately  $58  billion.  An  actual  closure  of  seaports  along  the  West  Coast  oc-
curred  for  10  days  in  2002  due  to  a  labor  dispute.  According  to  one  estimate,  the 
cost  of  this  closure  to  the  national  economy  for  the  first  5  days  was  estimated  at 
$4.7 billion and increased exponentially after that.2 Similarly, if one or more of the 
17 strategic U.S. seaports (or the ships carrying military supplies) were successfully 
attacked,  not  only  could  massive  civilian  casualties  be  sustained  and  critical  infra-
structure lost, but the military could also lose precious cargo and time and be forced 
to rely heavily on already burdened airlift capabilities. 
Many  Actions  Have  Been  Taken  or  Are  Underway  To  Address  Seaport

Security 

Since September 11, 2001, a number of actions have been taken or are underway 
to  address  seaport  security  by  a  diverse  mix  of  agencies  and  seaport  stakeholders. 
Federal  agencies,  such  as  the  Coast  Guard,  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection 
(CBP),  and  TSA,  have  been  tasked  with  responsibilities  and  functions  intended  to 
make seaports more secure, such as monitoring vessel traffic or inspecting cargo and 
containers, and procuring new assets such as aircraft and cutters to conduct patrols

and  respond  to  threats.  In  addition  to  these  federal  agencies,  seaport  stakeholders 
in the private sector and at the state and local levels of government have taken ac-
tions  to  enhance  the  security  of  seaports,  such  as  conducting  security  assessments 
of  infrastructure  and  vessels  operated  within  the  seaports  and  developing  security 
plans to protect against a terrorist attack. The actions taken by these agencies and 
stakeholders  are  primarily  aimed  at  three  types  of  protections:  (1)  identifying  and 
reducing vulnerabilities of the facilities, infrastructure, and vessels operating in sea-
ports, (2) securing the cargo and commerce flowing through seaports, and (3) devel-
oping  greater  maritime  domain  awareness  through  enhanced  intelligence,  informa-
tion-sharing capabilities, and assets and technologies. 
Identifying and Reducing the Vulnerabilities of Facilities, Infrastructure, and Vessels 
Seaports  facilitate  the  freedom  of  movement  and  flow  of  goods,  and  in  doing  so 
they allow people, cargo, and vessels to transit with relative anonymity. While sea-
ports  contain  terminals  and  other  facilities  where  goods  bound  for  import  or  export 
are  unloaded  and  loaded,  or  where  people  board  and  disembark  cruise  ships  or  fer-
ries, seaports also often contain other infrastructure critical to the Nation’s economy 
and defense, such as military installations, chemical factories, powerplants, and re-
fineries. The combination of assets, access, and anonymity makes for potentially at-
tractive  targets.  The  facilities  and  vessels  in  seaports  can  be  vulnerable  on  many 
fronts.  For  example,  facilities  where  containers  are  transferred  between  ships  and 
railroad cars or trucks must be able to screen vehicles entering the facility and rou-
tinely  check  cargo  for  evidence  of  tampering.  Chemical  factories  and  other  installa-
tions where hazardous materials are present must be able to control access to areas 
containing dangerous goods or hazardous substances. Vessels, ranging from oil tank-
ers and freighters to tugboats and passenger ferries, must be able to restrict access 
to certain areas on board the vessel, such as the bridge or other control stations crit-
ical to the vessel’s operation. 

Given  the  wide  range  of  potential  targets,  an  effective  security  response  includes 
identifying  targets,  assessing  risks  to  them,  and  taking  steps  to  reduce  or  mitigate 
these risks. An essential step in this process is to conduct a security or vulnerability 
assessment.  This  assessment,  which  is  needed  both  for  the  seaport  as  a  whole  and 
for  individual  vessels  and  facilities,  identifies  vulnerabilities  in  physical  structures, 
personnel protection systems, processes, and other areas that may lead to a security 
breach. For example, this assessment might reveal weaknesses in an organization’s 
security systems or unprotected access points such as a facility’s perimeter not being 
sufficiently  lighted  or  gates  not  being  secured  or  monitored  after  hours.  After  the 
vulnerabilities  are  identified,  measures  can  then  be  identified  that  will  reduce  or 
mitigate the vulnerabilities when installed or implemented. 

Most  actions  to  identify  and  reduce  the  vulnerabilities  within  seaports  were  spe-
cifically required by the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA). Pas-
sage  of  MTSA  was  a  major  step  in  establishing  a  security  framework  for  America’s 
seaports. This security framework includes assessment of risks, access controls over 
personnel  and  facilities,  and  development  and  implementation  of  security  plans, 
among other activities. Table 1 shows some of the actions that have been taken and 
programs that are in the process of being implemented to carry out this framework.3

MTSA  and  its  implementing  regulations  require  designated 
owners or operators of maritime facilities or vessels to iden-
tify  vulnerabilities  and  develop  security  plans  for  their  fa-
cilities or vessels. The plans were reviewed and approved by 
the  Coast  Guard.  Since  July  1,  2004,  the  Coast  Guard  has 
been conducting inspections of these facilities and vessels to 
ensure the plans have been implemented. The Coast Guard 
completed inspections of the facilities by December 31, 2004, 
and  is  scheduled  to  complete  inspections  of  the  vessels  by 
July 1, 2005.

To  meet  another  MTSA  requirement,  the  Coast  Guard  led  ef-
forts  to  conduct  a  seaport-wide  security  assessment  of  each 
of the Nation’s seaports and develop a security plan for the 
seaport zone. In carrying out these efforts, the Coast Guard 
worked  with  a  wide  variety  of  stakeholders,  such  as  state 
and local governments, law enforcement, owners and opera-
tors  of  facilities  and  vessels,  and  trade  and  labor  organiza-
tions.

TWIC  is  designed  to  respond  to  various  statutory  provisions 
relating  to  transportation  related  worker  identification  in-
cluding  MTSA,  which  requires  a  biometric  identification 
card be issued to individuals requiring unescorted access to 
secure  areas  of  seaport  facilities  or  vessels.  This  credential 
is  being  designed  to  be  a  universally  recognized  identifica-
tion card accepted across all modes of the national transpor-
tation  system,  including  airports,  railroad  terminals,  and 
seaports.

Separate  from  MTSA  requirements,  the  Coast  Guard  estab-
lished  a  program  after  September  11,  2001,  to  assess 
vulnerabilities of the Nation’s 55 most strategic commercial 
and  military  seaports.  The  program  has  changed  consider-
ably since its inception and now includes a geographic infor-
mation system (GIS) to help identify and provide up-to-date 
information on threats and incidents, as well as provide ac-
cessible information to help develop security plans. 

Source: GAO analysis of Coast Guard and TSA data. 
The  amount  of  effort  involved  in  carrying  out  these  actions  and  implementing 
these  programs  has  been  considerable.  For  example,  after  following  an  aggressive 
time  frame  to  develop  regulations  to  implement  the  requirements  of  MTSA,  the 
Coast  Guard  reviewed  and  approved  the  security  plans  of  the  over  3,000  facilities 
and more than 9,000 vessels that were required to identify their vulnerabilities and 
take  action  to  reduce  them.  Six  months  after  July  1,  2004,  the  date  by  which  the 
security plans were to be implemented, the Coast Guard reported that it completed 
on-site inspections of all facilities and thousands of vessels to ensure the plans were 
being  implemented  as  approved.  In  addition  to  its  work  on  the  security  plans  and 
inspections,  the  Coast  Guard  completed  security  assessments  of  the  Nation’s  55 
most economically and militarily strategic seaports. 
Securing the Cargo Flowing Through Seaports 

While 

the 

facilities,  vessels,  and 

infrastructure  within  seaports  have 
vulnerabilities to terrorist attack, the cargoes transiting through seaports also have 
vulnerabilities that terrorists could exploit. Containers are of particular concern be-
cause they can be filled overseas at so many different locations and are transported 
through complex logistics networks before reaching U.S. seaports. From the time the 
container  is  loaded  for  shipping  to  the  time  the  container  arrives  at  a  seaport,  the 
containers  must  go  through  several  steps  that  involve  many  different  participants 
and  many  points  of  transfer.  Each  of  these  steps  in  the  supply  chain  presents  its 
own  vulnerabilities  that  terrorists  could  take  advantage  of  to  place  a  WMD  into  a

container for shipment to the United States. A report prepared by the National De-
fense  University’s  Center  for  Technology  and  National  Security  Policy  stated  that 
a container is ideally suited to deliver a WMD or a radiological ‘‘dirty bomb.’’ While 
there  have  been  no  known  incidents  yet  of  containers  being  used  to  transport 
WMDs, criminals have exploited containers for other illegal purposes, such as smug-
gling  weapons,  people,  and  illicit  substances.  Such  activities  demonstrate  the  vul-
nerability  of  the  freight  transportation  industry  and  suggest  opportunities  for  fur-
ther exploitation of containers by criminals, including terrorist groups. 

In general, the actions taken thus far are aimed at identifying, tracking, and scru-
tinizing  the  container  cargo  shipments  moving  into  the  country.  Most  of  these  ac-
tions are being done by CBP, the DHS agency responsible for protecting the Nation’s 
borders  and  official  ports  of  entry.  CBP  uses  a  layered  approach  that  attempts  to 
focus resources on potentially risky cargo containers while allowing other cargo con-
tainers to proceed without disrupting commerce. This approach includes the actions 
and  programs  shown  in  table  2.  Several  of  these  actions  involve  a  strategy  of  mov-
ing  primary  reliance  for  security  away  from  control  systems  at  U.S.  seaports  of 
entry and toward improved controls at points of origin and along the way.4

Begun  by  the  private  sector  and  now  administered  by  DHS’s 
Office of Domestic Preparedness, efforts center on (1) ensur-
ing  that  containers  are  loaded  in  a  secure  environment  at 
the  point  of  product  origin,  with  100  percent  verification  of 
their  contents;  (2)  using  such  technology  as  pressure,  light, 
or  temperature  sensors  to  continually  monitor  containers 
throughout their overseas voyage to the point of distribution 
in  the  United  States;  and  (3)  using  cargo-tracking  tech-
nology  to  keep  accurate  track  of  containers  at  all  points  in 
the  supply  chain,  including  distribution  to  their  ultimate 
destinations.

In 2003, the Department of Energy (DOE) initiated the Initia-
tive to enable foreign government personnel at key seaports 
to use radiation detection equipment to screen shipping con-
tainers  entering  and  leaving  these  seaports  for  nuclear  and 
other  radioactive  material  that  could  be  used  against  the 
United  States  or  its  allies.  Through  the  Initiative,  DOE  in-
stalls radiation detection equipment at foreign seaports that 
is  then  operated  by  foreign  government  officials  and  port 
personnel working at these seaports.

million  appropriated  by  Congress,  is  intended  to  help  strengthen  the  security  of 
cargo as it moves along the international supply chain in containers.5 In late 2004, 
the  second  of  two  initial  phases  of  the  project  was  concluded.  This  phase  involved 
identifying  the  security  vulnerabilities  of  19  separate  supply  chains  and  trying  out 
technologies,  such  as  container  seals  or  sensors,  and  their  integration  with  govern-
mental  policies,  logistic  processes  and  procedures  that  could  mitigate  those 
vulnerabilities.  The  project  has  received  additional  funding  of  $17  million  that  has 
been targeted to conduct a third phase in which the best technologies and practices 
identified  in  the  first  two  phases  will  be  further  tested  on  a  high  number  of  con-
tainers  for  their  effectiveness  and  tamper  resistance  on  three  separate  supply 
chains.  A  report  on  the  best  practices  identified  in  the  first  two  phases  is  expected 
to be issued in June 2005, and completion of the third phase is expected by October 
2006. 

The other actions taken to enhance the security of cargo and commerce have been 
substantial.  In  2002  CBP  quickly  rolled  out  the  CSI  and  C–TPAT  programs  shown 
in  table  2  and  enlisted  the  participation  of  several  countries  and  companies.  By 
April  2005,  CSI  was  operational  at  35  seaports,  located  in  18  countries.  Similarly, 
C–TPAT  membership  grew  from  about  1,700  companies  in  January  2003  to  over 
9,000 companies in March 2005. Given the urgency to take steps to protect against 
terrorism  after  the  September  11,  2001,  attacks,  some  of  the  actions  were  taken 
using an ‘‘implement and amend’’ approach. That is, CBP had to immediately imple-
ment the activity with the knowledge it may need to modify the approach later. For 
example, in August 2002, CBP modified the already developed Automatic Targeting 
System with new terrorism-related criteria. 
Developing Greater Maritime Domain Awareness 

The  third  main  area  of  activity  to  enhance  seaport  security—maritime  domain 
awareness—is  the  understanding  by  stakeholders  involved  in  maritime  security  of 
anything  associated  with  the  global  maritime  environment  that  could  adversely  af-
fect the security, safety, economy or environment of the United States. This aware-
ness is essential to identify and respond to any unusual patterns or anomalies that 
could  portend  a  possible  terrorist  attack.  To  be  effective,  maritime  domain  aware-
ness must be comprehensive and include information on vessels, seaport infrastruc-
tures  and  facilities,  shipping  lanes  and  transit  corridors,  waterways,  and  anchor-
ages,  among  other  things.  It  must  also  identify  threats  as  soon  as  possible  and  far 
enough  away  from  U.S.  seaports  to  eliminate  or  mitigate  the  threat.  By  effectively 
identifying potential threats, this awareness can be used as a force multiplier to po-
sition  resources  where  they  are  needed  most  to  respond,  instead  of  spreading  out 
limited  resources  to  address  all  threats,  no  matter  how  unlikely  they  are  to  occur. 
In addition, when shared, this awareness has the potential to facilitate the coordina-
tion of efforts of local, state, federal, and even international stakeholders in respond-
ing to potential threats. 

After  the  attacks  of  September  11,  2001,  the  Coast  Guard  took  steps  such  as  in-
creasing  the  number  of  security  patrols  conducted  within  seaports  and  waterways 
that helped contribute to increased maritime domain awareness. Although maritime 
homeland security duties are not new to the Coast Guard, the number of hours the 
Coast  Guard  used  resources  (such  as  ships,  boats,  or  aircraft)  to  carry  out  seaport, 
waterway, and coastal security activities during Fiscal Year 2003 increased by 1,220 
percent  from  their  pre-September  11,  2001,  level.  Relative  to  the  rest  of  the  Coast 
Guard’s  responsibilities,  this  represented  an  increase  from  4  percent  of  the  Coast 
Guard’s  total  annual  resource  hours  being  used  for  seaport,  waterway,  and  coastal 
security activities before September 11, 2001, to 34 percent by September 30, 2003. 
These  activities  provide  an  important  input  to  maritime  domain  awareness  as  it 
places  Coast  Guard  personnel  out  in  the  seaports  where  they  can  observe,  report, 
and  respond  to  suspect  activities  or  vessels.  In  addition,  these  patrols  provide  the 
Coast  Guard  with  a  visible  presence  out  in  the  seaport  that  may  deter  a  potential 
terrorist attack from being carried out. 

As  the  lead  federal  agency  responsible  for  protecting  the  U.S.  maritime  domain, 
the  Coast  Guard  has  spearheaded  an  interagency  approach  for  establishing  mari-
time  domain  awareness.  Within  this  approach  are  several  activities  and  actions  in-
tended  to  collect  information  and  intelligence,  analyze  the  information  and  intel-
ligence,  and  disseminate  the  analyzed  information  and  intelligence  to  appropriate 
federal,  state,  local,  or  private  seaport  stakeholders.  Some  of  these  actions  were  re-
quired  under  MTSA,  such  as  the  establishment  of  an  Automatic  Identification  Sys-
tem  to  track  vessels,  as  well  as  creation  of  area  maritime  security  committees  of 
local  seaport  stakeholders  who  identify  and  address  risks  within  their  seaport.  In 
addition  to  these  actions,  the  Department  of  Defense  and  DHS  formed  a  Maritime 
Domain  Awareness  Senior  Steering  Group  in  2004  to  coordinate  national  efforts  to

improve maritime domain awareness. Under Homeland Security Presidential Direc-
tive  13,  issued  in  December  2004,  this  steering  group  is  required  to  develop  a  na-
tional  plan  for  maritime  domain  awareness  by  June  2005.  According  to  the  head  of 
the Coast Guard’s maritime domain awareness program, a draft of this plan is being 
reviewed before it is submitted to the President. Table 3 shows some of the actions 
currently being taken or underway to enhance maritime domain awareness.

Example of activity 

Automatic  Identification  System:  AIS  uses  a  device  aboard  a  ves-
sel to transmit an identifying signal to a receiver located at the sea-
port  and  other  ships  in  the  area.  This  signal  gives  seaport  officials 
and  other  vessels  nearly  instantaneous  information  and  awareness 
about  a  vessel’s  identity,  position,  speed,  and  course.  The  Coast 
Guard  intends  to  provide  AIS  coverage  to  meet  maritime  domain 
awareness  requirements  in  all  navigable  waters  of  the  United 
States  and  further  offshore.  As  of  May  2005,  the  Coast  Guard  has 
AIS  coverage  in  several  seaports  and  coastal  areas.a In  addition  to 
this system, the Coast Guard is also working with the International 
Maritime Organization (IMO) to develop functional and technical re-
quirements for long-range tracking out to 2,000 nautical miles. The 
Coast  Guard  proposed  an  amendment  to  the  International  Conven-
tion  for  Safety  of  Life  at  Sea  (SOLAS)  for  this  initiative,  which  is 
currently  under  consideration  by  the  international  body.  However, 
according  to  the  Coast  Guard,  the  issue  of  long-range  tracking  is 
contentious  internationally  and  it  is  uncertain  whether  the  amend-
ment will be adopted.

Maritime  Intelligence  Fusion  Centers  and  Field  Intelligence 
Support  Teams:  Centers  have  been  established  by  the  Coast 
Guard  on  the  East  and  West  Coasts  to  provide  actionable  intel-
ligence to Coast Guard commanders and units. The teams also con-
duct  initial  analysis  of  intelligence  in  coordination  with  federal, 
state, and local law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

Area  Maritime  Security  Committees:  The  committees  serve  as  fo-
rums for local seaport stakeholders from federal agencies, state and 
local  governments,  law  enforcement,  and  private  industries  to  gain 
a comprehensive perspective of security issues at a seaport location. 
Information  is  disseminated  through  regularly  scheduled  meetings, 
issuance  of  electronic  bulletins  on  suspicious  activities  around  sea-
port  facilities,  and  sharing  key  documents.  The  committees  also 
serve  as  a  link  for  communicating  threats  and  security  information 
to seaport stakeholders. 

Interagency  Operational  Centers:  These  centers  provide  informa-
tion  24  hours  a  day  about  maritime  activities  and  involve  various 
federal  and  nonfederal  agencies  directly  in  operational  decisions 
using this information. Radar, sensors, and cameras offer represen-
tations of vessels and facilities. Other data are available from intel-
ligence  sources,  including  data  on  vessels,  cargo,  and  crew.  Unlike 
the  area  maritime  security  committees,  these  centers  are  oper-
ational  in  nature  with  a  unified  or  joint  command  structure  de-
signed  to  receive  information  and  act  on  it.  Representatives  from 
the  various  agencies  work  side  by  side,  each  having  access  to  data-
bases  and  other  sources  of  information  from  their  respective  agen-
cies.  These  currently  exist  in  three  locations:  Charleston,  South 
Carolina; Norfolk, Virginia; and San Diego, California.

While  many  of  the  activities  to  develop  maritime  domain  awareness  are  still  un-
derway,  some  progress  has  already  been  made.  One  activity  in  this  area  that  we 
have recently looked at concerns the process of information sharing between federal 
and  non-federal  seaport  stakeholders  participating  on  area  maritime  security  com-
mittees.6 The  Coast  Guard  organized  43  of  these  committees,  covering  the  Nation’s 
361  seaports.  While  a  primary  purpose  of  the  committees  is  to  develop  a  seaport-
wide  security  plan  for  their  respective  seaports,  the  committees  also  provide  links 
for  communicating  threats  and  security  information  to  seaport  stakeholders—links 
that generally did not exist prior to the creation of the committees. The types of in-
formation  shared  among  committee  members  with  security  clearances  included  as-
sessments of vulnerabilities at specific seaport locations, information about potential 
threats  or  suspicious  activities,  and  strategies  to  use  in  protecting  key  infrastruc-
ture.  Our  review  found  that  the  committees  improved  information  sharing  among 
seaport  security  stakeholders,  including  the  timeliness,  completeness,  and  useful-
ness of information shared. 

Another  aspect  of  improving  maritime  domain  awareness  involves  having  the  as-
sets  to  communicate  and  conduct  patrols,  and  in  this  regard,  the  Coast  Guard  has 
budgeted  for  and  is  in  the  process  of  receiving  substantial  new  resources.  In  1996, 
the  Coast  Guard  initiated  a  major  recapitalization  effort—known  as  the  Integrated 
Deepwater  System—to  replace  and  modernize  the  agency’s  aging  and  deteriorating 
fleet of aircraft and vessel assets. The focus of the program is not just on new ships 
and aircraft, but also on newer, more capable assets, with improved and integrated 
command,  control,  communications  and  computers,  intelligence,  surveillance,  and 
reconnaissance  (C4ISR)  capabilities.  Although  the  program  was  started  before  the 
attacks of September 11, 2001, the Coast Guard plans to leverage these capabilities 
of  the  20  year,  $17  billion  dollar  program  to  enhance  its  maritime  domain  aware-
ness and seaport security operations such as patrols and response. 
Challenges for Improving Maritime Security Take Three Main Forms 

Propelled  by  a  strong  sense  of  urgency  to  secure  the  seaports,  federal  agencies, 
such  as  the  Coast  Guard,  CBP,  and  TSA,  accomplished  a  considerable  amount  in 
a short time. At the same time, these actions have also shown the strains that often 
occur when difficult tasks must be done quickly. We have not examined every action 
that  has  been  started  or  enhanced  regarding  maritime  security,  but  our  work  to 
date has covered a number of them. It is not surprising that we have found, besides 
the progress made, a number of missteps, false starts, and inefficiencies. These rep-
resent challenges to overcome. 

While some of these challenges will be resolved with time, analysis, and oversight, 
there are other challenges that bear even more careful watching, because they may 
prove  to  be  considerably  more  difficult  to  overcome.  I  would  like  to  highlight  three 
of  those  challenges,  providing  examples  from  our  recent  work.  These  three  chal-
lenges  involve  (1)  design  and  implementing  programs,  (2)  coordinating  between  dif-
ferent agencies and stakeholder interests, and (3) determining how to pay for these 
efforts. 
Challenges in Program Design and Implementation 

I will discuss today two illustrative examples related to challenges in program de-
sign  and  implementation  that  we  have  identified  from  our  work.  These  include  the 
(1)  lack  of  planning  and  performance  measures  for  program  design  and  (2)  lack  of 
experienced personnel for program implementation. 
Lack of Planning and Performance Measures for Program Design 

One  effect  of  having  to  design  programs  quickly  is  that  they  may  lack  such  ele-
ments  as  strategic  plans  and  performance  measures  needed  to  set  program  goals 
and  monitor  performance.  The  lack  of  such  tools  can  create  problems  that  need  to 
be  resolved  as  the  program  unfolds.  For  example,  we  have  reviewed  CBP’s  actions 
to  establish  a  system  meant  to  reliably  identify  potentially  risky  cargo  containers. 
Our work has shown that a need exists for additional efforts in several homeland 
security activities, including securing cargo, in order to help ensure the effectiveness 
of the approach.7 As we noted in a July 2003 report, the former U.S. Customs Serv-
ice,  part  of  which  is  now  CBP  initiated  the  Container  Security  Initiative  (CSI)  in 
January  2002  in  response  to  security  vulnerabilities  created  by  ocean  container 
trade and the concern that terrorists could exploit these vulnerabilities to transport 
or  detonate  WMDs  in  the  United  States.8 During  the  first  year,  program  officials 
quickly  designed  and  rolled  out  the  initiative,  modifying  operations  over  time.  The 
service  achieved  strong  initial  participation  among  the  countries  that  it  sought  to 
enroll  in  the  initiative,  reaching  agreement  with  15  governments  to  place  U.S.  per-
sonnel at 24 seaports, and placing teams in 5 of these seaports. However, CBP had 
not  taken  adequate  steps  to  incorporate  human  capital  planning,  develop  perform-

ance  measures,  and  plan  strategically—factors  essential  to  the  program’s  long-term 
success and accountability. We noted, for example, that:

• More than 1 year into the implementation of the initiative, CBP had not devel-
oped  a  systematic  human  capital  plan  to  recruit,  train,  and  assign  the  more 
than  120  program  staff  that  would  be  needed  for  long-term  assignments  in  a 
wide  range  of  foreign  seaports,  some  of  which  could  require  language  capabili-
ties and diplomatic skills.
• CBP lacked performance measures for the initiative that demonstrated program 
achievements  and  established  accountability.  For  example,  the  service  lacked 
measures  that  assessed  the  impact  of  collocating  U.S.  and  foreign  customs  offi-
cials  in  foreign  seaports  to  determine  which  containers  should  be  targeted  for 
inspection.
• CBP’s  focus  on  short-term  operational  planning  in  order  to  quickly  implement 
the  program  impeded  its  ability  to  systematically  carry  out  strategic  planning. 
We  noted  that  the  service  did  not  have  a  strategic  plan  for  the  initiative  that 
describes  how  it  intends  to  achieve  program  goals  and  objectives.  As  a  result, 
CBP lacked elements of strategic planning that would improve the management 
of  the  program  and  allow  CBP  to  establish  accountability  for  planned  expendi-
tures.

As  also  reported  in  July  2003,  another  program  that  did  not  take  adequate  steps 
to incorporate the human capital planning and performance measures necessary for 
the  program’s  long-term  success  and  accountability  is  CBP’s  Customs-Trade  Part-
nership  Against  Terrorism  (C–TPAT)  program.  Initiated  in  November  2001,  C–
TPAT is an initiative that attempts to improve the security of the international sup-
ply  chain.  It  is  a  cooperative  program  between  CBP  and  members  of  the  inter-
national trade community in which private companies agree to improve the security 
of  their  supply  chains  in  return  for  a  reduced  likelihood  that  their  containers  will 
be inspected. 

During the first year, more than 1,700 companies agreed to participate in the pro-
gram,  and  most  received  the  key  benefit—a  reduced  likelihood  of  inspections  for 
WMDs.  However,  we  noted  similar  kinds  of  problems  to  those  in  the  CSI  program. 
For example, we found that:

for increasing the number of C–TPAT staff from 10 to more than 160.

• Even as it rolled out new program elements, CBP lacked a human capital plan 
• CBP had not developed performance measures for C–TPAT that would establish 
accountability  and  measure  program  achievements.  For  example,  CBP  had  no 
performance  measure  to  assess  the  impact  of  C–TPAT  on  improving  supply 
chain  security  practices,  possibly  resulting  in  benefits  being  granted  to 
undeserving companies.
• CBP  lacked  strategic  planning  in  rolling  out  C–TPAT,  failing  to  communicate 
how  it  planned  to  implement  critical  program  elements  designed  to  verify  that 
companies  have  security  measures  in  place  and  follow  through  with  rec-
ommended changes.

We are currently reviewing both the CSI and C–TPAT programs and will soon be 

issuing reports to update our earlier evaluation of these programs. 
Lack of Experienced Personnel for Program Implementation 

One  major  challenge  in  program  implementation  is  the  lack  of  experienced  per-
sonnel,  which  is  to  be  expected  given  the  rapid  increase  in  newly  hired  personnel 
since September 11, 2001. Agencies such as the Coast Guard expect to see large in-
creases  in  the  number  of  staff  over  the  next  few  years  to  help  meet  new  and  ex-
panded  responsibilities.  Consequently,  they  also  face  a  challenge  in  absorbing  this 
increase and training them to be fully productive. We pointed out early on that this 
would  be  a  challenge  for  the  Coast  Guard,9 and  subsequent  work  has  shown  this 
to  be  the  case.  For  example,  after  a  Coast  Guard  internal  review  found  that  readi-
ness  of  its  multi-mission  stations—the  shore-based  units  whose  responsibilities  in-
clude finding and rescuing mariners in danger—had been in decline for an extended 
period, the Coast Guard began efforts to improve the readiness of the stations. This 
effort was complicated by the new homeland security responsibilities the stations as-
sumed after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. In a recent review of staff-
ing and readiness at these multi-mission stations,10 we found that the Coast Guard 
was still in the process of defining new standards for security activities and had yet 
to  translate  the  impact  of  security-related  mission  responsibilities  into  specific  sta-
tion readiness requirements, such as staffing standards. Consequently, even though 
station  staffing  had  increased  25  percent  since  2001,  the  Coast  Guard  was  unable

36

to  align  staffing  resources  with  mission  activities,  which  resulted  in  a  significant 
number  of  positions  not  being  filled  with  qualified  personnel  and  station  personnel 
working  significantly  longer  hours  than  are  allowed  under  the  Coast  Guard’s  work 
standards. 

We  also  identified  personnel  or  human  capital  challenges  such  as  lack  of  experi-
enced personnel related to the Coast Guard’s program to oversee implementation of 
MTSA-required  security  plans  by  owners  and  operators  of  maritime  facilities  and 
vessels. These security plans are performance-based, meaning the Coast Guard has 
specified  the  outcomes  it  is  seeking  to  achieve  and  has  given  seaport  stakeholders 
responsibility  for  identifying  and  delivering  the  measures  needed  to  achieve  these 
outcomes.  While  this  approach  provides  flexibility  to  owners  and  operators  in  de-
signing  and  implementing  their  plans,  it  also  places  a  premium  on  the  skills  and 
experience  of  inspectors  to  identify  deficiencies  and  recommend  corrective  action. 
Because the Coast Guard had to review and assess for compliance more than 12,000 
security  plans  for  facilities  and  vessels,  it  had  to  rely  heavily  on  reservists,  which 
varied  greatly  in  the  level  of  their  skills  and  experience  in  this  area.  For  example, 
some  reservists  had  graduate  degrees  in  security  management  while  others  had  no 
formal  security  training  or  experience.  In  June  2004,  we  recommended  that  the 
Coast Guard carefully evaluate its efforts during the initial surge period for inspec-
tions.11 The  Coast  Guard  has  adjusted  its  inspection  program  to  make  its  compli-
ance assessments more relevant and useful, but it has not yet determined the over-
all effectiveness of its compliance actions. 
Challenges in Coordinating Actions 

Coordinating  massive  new  homeland  security  actions  has  been  an  acknowledged 
challenge since the events of September 11, 2001, and seaport security has been no 
exception.  On  the  federal  side  alone,  we  have  for  several  years  designated  imple-
menting  and  transforming  the  new  DHS  as  a  high-risk  area.12 Since  the  agency’s 
inception  in  March  2003,  DHS  leadership  has  provided  a  foundation  to  maintain 
critical  operations  while  undergoing  transformation,  and  the  agency  has  begun  to 
put  systems  in  place  to  operate  more  effectively  and  efficiently  as  an  agency.  In 
managing its transformation, however, DHS still faces such issues as forming effec-
tive partnerships with other governmental and private-sector entities. 

We  have  made  numerous  recommendations  related  to  information  sharing,  par-
ticularly  as  it  relates  to  fulfilling  federal  critical  infrastructure  protection  respon-
sibilities. 13 For  example,  we  have  reported  on  the  practices  of  organizations  that 
successfully share sensitive or time-critical information, including establishing trust 
relationships,  developing  information-sharing  standards  and  protocols,  establishing 
secure communications mechanisms, and disseminating sensitive information appro-
priately.  Federal  agencies  such  as  DHS  and  the  Coast  Guard  have  concurred  with 
our recommendations that they develop appropriate strategies to address the many 
potential  barriers  to  information  sharing.  However,  as  of  January  2005,  many  fed-
eral  efforts  to  do  this  remain  in  the  planning  or  early  implementation  stages  espe-
cially  in  the  area  of  homeland  security  information  sharing,  including  establishing 
clear  goals,  objectives,  and  expectations  for  the  many  participants  in  information-
sharing  efforts;  and  consolidating,  standardizing,  and  enhancing  federal  structures, 
policies,  and  capabilities  for  the  analysis  and  dissemination  of  information.  In  this 
regard,  the  issue  of  information-sharing  across  agency  and  stakeholder  lines  has 
emerged as a significant enough challenge that we have also designated it as a high-
risk  area.  Here  are  three  examples  that  illustrate  the  kinds  of  problems  and  chal-
lenges that remain related to seaport security. 
Obtaining Security Clearances 

While coordination of information-sharing at the seaport level appears to have im-
proved, seaports are experiencing challenges with regards to non-federal officials ob-
taining security clearances. For some time, state and local seaport and law enforce-
ment personnel have reported problems in obtaining federally generated intelligence 
information  about  their  jurisdictions  because  they  did  not  have  a  federal  security 
clearance. However, as of February 2005—over 4 months after the Coast Guard had 
developed  a  list  of  over  350  non-federal  area  maritime  security  committee  partici-
pants  as  having  a  need  for  a  security  clearance—only  28  had  submitted  the  nec-
essary paperwork for the background check. Local Coast Guard officials told us they 
did  not  clearly  understand  their  responsibility  for  communicating  with  state  and 
local  officials  about  the  process  for  obtaining  a  security  clearance.  After  we  ex-
pressed our concerns to Coast Guard officials in headquarters in February 2005, of-
ficials  took  action  and  drafted  guidelines  clarifying  the  role  that  local  Coast  Guard 
officials play in the program.

Sharing Information about Security Exercises 

In a January 2005 report,14 we reported that improvement in the coordination of 
state,  local,  and  federal  entities  during  seaport  exercises  was  needed.  While  it  was 
still  too  early  to  determine  how  well  entities  will  function  in  coordinating  an  effec-
tive  response  to  a  seaport-related  threat  or  incident,  we  identified  four  operational 
issues  that  needed  to  be  addressed  in  order  to  promote  more  effective  coordination. 
We  found  that  more  than  half  of  the  seaport  exercises  and  after-action  reports  we 
examined  raised  communication  issues,  including  problems  with  information  shar-
ing  among  first  responders  and  across  agency  lines.  We  also  found  that  over  half 
of the exercises raised concerns with communication and the resources available, in-
cluding  inadequate  facilities  or  equipment,  differing  response  procedures,  and  the 
need  for  additional  training  in  joint  agency  response.  To  a  lesser  extent,  we  found 
concerns  with  participants’  ability  to  coordinate  effectively  and  know  who  had  the 
proper authority to raise security levels, board vessels, or detain passengers. 
Developing a Transportation Worker Identification Credential 

Beyond  information-sharing,  a  host  of  challenges  remain  in  coordinating  across 
agency lines and in resolving issues that cut across a wide range of stakeholder per-
spectives.  In  this  regard,  there  is  perhaps  no  better  example  in  our  recent  work 
than the delayed attempts to develop a major component of the security framework 
envisioned under MTSA—an identification card for maritime workers. The transpor-
tation  worker  identification  credential  (TWIC)  was  initially  envisioned  by  TSA  be-
fore it became part of DHS to be a universally recognized identification card accept-
ed  across  all  modes  of  the  national  transportation  system,  including  airports,  sea-
ports,  and  railroad  terminals,  using  biological  metrics,  such  as  fingerprints,  to  en-
sure  individuals  with  such  an  identification  card  had  undergone  an  assessment 
verifying that they do not pose a terrorism security risk. TSA initially projected that 
it  would  test  a  prototype  of  such  a  card  system  in  2003  and  issue  the  first  of  the 
cards  in  August  2004.  After  TSA  became  part  of  DHS,  testing  of  the  prototype  was 
delayed  because  of  the  difficulty  in  obtaining  a  response  from  DHS  policy  officials 
who  also  subsequently  directed  the  agency  to  reexamine  additional  options  for 
issuing the identification card. In addition to coordinating within DHS, TSA has had 
to  coordinate  with  over  800  national  level  transportation-related  stakeholders.  Sev-
eral stakeholders at seaports and seaport facilities told us that, while TSA solicited 
their  input  on  some  issues,  TSA  did  not  respond  to  their  input  or  involve  them  in 
making  decisions  regarding  eligibility  requirements  for  the  card.15 In  particular, 
some  stakeholders  said  they  had  not  been  included  in  discussions  about  which  fel-
ony  convictions  should  disqualify  a  worker  from  receiving  a  card,  even  though  they 
had expected and requested that DHS and TSA involve them in these decisions. Ob-
taining  stakeholder  involvement  is  important  because  achieving  program  goals 
hinges  on  the  Federal  Government’s  ability  to  form  effective  partnerships  among 
many  public  and  private  stakeholders.  If  such  partnerships  are  not  in  place—and 
equally important, if they do not work effectively—TSA may not be able to test and 
deliver a program that performs as expected. Until TSA and DHS officials agree on 
a  comprehensive  project  plan  to  guide  the  remainder  of  the  project  and  work  to-
gether  to  set  and  complete  deadlines,  and  TSA  can  effectively  manage  its  stake-
holders’  interests,  it  may  not  be  able  to  successfully  develop,  test,  and  implement 
the card program. We issued a report on TWIC in December 2004 16 and the Senate 
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs has asked us to review 
the program again. 
Challenges in Providing Funding for Seaport Security Actions and Initiatives 

Our reviews indicate that funding is a pressing challenge to putting effective sea-
port  security  measures  in  place  and  sustaining  these  measures  over  time.  This  is 
the view of many transportation security experts, industry representatives, and fed-
eral,  state,  and  local  government  officials  with  whom  we  have  spoken.  While  some 
security  improvements  are  inexpensive,  most  require  substantial  and  continuous 
funding. For example, a preliminary Coast Guard estimate placed the cost of imple-
menting  the  International  Maritime  Organization  security  code  and  the  security 
provisions  in  MTSA  at  approximately  $1.5  billion  for  the  first  year  and  $7.3  billion 
over  the  succeeding  decade.  This  estimate  should  be  viewed  more  as  a  rough  indi-
cator  than  a  precise  measure  of  costs,  but  it  does  show  that  the  cost  is  likely  to  be 
substantial.17

At  the  federal  level,  more  than  $560  million  in  grants  has  been  made  available 
to  seaports,  localities,  and  other  stakeholders  since  2002  under  the  Port  Security 
Grant  Program  and  the  Urban  Area  Security  Initiative.  The  purpose  of  these  pro-
grams  was  to  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  seaports  to  potential  terrorist  attacks  by 
enhancing facility and operation security. The programs funded several projects, in-

cluding security assessments; physical enhancements, such as gates and fences; sur-
veillance  equipment,  such  as  cameras;  and  the  acquisition  of  security  equipment, 
such as patrol vessels or vehicles. Awardees have included seaport authorities, local 
governments,  vessel  operators,  and  private  companies  with  facilities  in  seaport 
areas.  Interest  in  receiving  port  security  grants  has  been  strong,  and,  as  figure  2 
shows,  applicant  requests  have  far  exceeded  available  funds.  We  are  currently  ex-
amining the Port Security Grant Program at the request of several Members of Con-
gress,  and  we  are  focusing  this  review  on  the  risk  management  practices  used  in 
comparing  and  prioritizing  applications.  Our  work  is  under  way,  and  we  expect  to 
issue our report later this year.18

Note:  Figure  2  does  not  include  $75  million  that  was  awarded  to  14  high-risk 
seaport areas under the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) by the Office of 
Domestic Preparedness. This program is separate from its basic UASI program, 
which provided formula grants to 50 urban areas for equipment, training, plan-
ning, exercise, operational needs, and critical infrastructure.

Where  the  money  will  come  from  for  all  of  the  funding  needs  is  unclear.  In  our 
2002 statement on national preparedness,19 we highlighted the need to examine the 
sustainability  of  increased  funding  not  only  for  seaport  security,  but  for  homeland 
security efforts in general. The current economic environment makes this a difficult 
time  for  private  industry  and  state  and  local  governments  to  make  security  invest-
ments  and  sustain  increased  security  costs.  According  to  industry  representatives 
and  experts  we  contacted,  most  of  the  transportation  industry  operates  on  a  very 
thin profit margin, making it difficult to pay for additional security measures. Budg-
etary  and  revenue  constraints,  coupled  with  increasing  demands  on  resources, 
makes it more critical that federal programs be designed carefully to match the pri-

orities and needs of all partners—federal, state, local, and private—and provide the 
greatest results for the expenditure. 
Setting  Performance  Goals  and  Measures  and  Assessing  Risk  Are

Important Next Steps 

The  final  purpose  of  my  testimony  today  is  to  offer  observations,  based  on  the 
work we have done to date, about important next steps for decision makers in chart-
ing a course for future actions. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, evoked 
with  stunning  clarity  the  face  and  intent  of  enemies  very  different  from  those  the 
nation  has  faced  before—terrorists  such  as  al  Qaeda,  willing  and  able  to  attack  us 
in our territory using tactics designed to take advantage of our relatively open soci-
ety and individual freedoms. The amount of activity in response has been consider-
able, and although there have been no serious incidents in the United States in the 
interim,  the  threat  of  terrorism  will  likely  persist  well  into  the  21st  century.  Thus, 
it  is  important  to  continue  to  make  progress  in  our  efforts.  Beyond  addressing  the 
kinds of challenges discussed above, however, two other matters stand out. One in-
volves  developing  a  better  understanding  of  how  much  progress  has  actually  been 
made to secure our seaports; the other involves developing a better strategy to man-
age  risk  and  prioritize  what  areas  need  further  progress  and  how  resources  can  be 
best allocated. 
Lack of Goals and Measures Makes Determining Progress Difficult 

Although  there  is  widespread  agreement  that  actions  taken  so  far  have  led  to  a 
heightened  awareness  of  the  need  for  security  and  an  enhanced  ability  to  identify 
and  respond  to  many  security  threats,  it  is  difficult  to  translate  these  actions  into 
a  clear  sense  of  how  far  we  have  progressed  in  making  seaports  more  secure.  One 
reason is that seaport security efforts, like homeland security efforts in general, lack 
measurable  goals,  as  well  as  performance  measures  to  measure  progress  toward 
those  goals.  As  others  such  as  the  Gilmore  Commission  have  stated,  a  continuing 
problem  for  homeland  security  has  been  the  lack  of  clear  strategic  guidance  about 
the  definition  and  objectives  of  preparedness.20 For  example,  the  Coast  Guard  has 
a set of performance indicators for each of its non-security missions. It regularly re-
ports on how well it is doing in rescuing mariners at sea, interdicting foreign fishing 
boats  attempting  to  fish  in  the  U.S.  exclusive  economic  zone,  or  maintaining  aids 
to navigation on the Nation’s waterways. However, although it has been more than 
3 years since the September 11, 2001, attacks, the Coast Guard is still in the proc-
ess of developing a performance indicator for its seaport security activities that can 
be  used  to  indicate  what  progress  has  been  made  to  secure  seaports.  Completion  of 
this  indicator  and  careful  tracking  of  it  over  the  long  term  is  essential  to  help  en-
sure  that  taxpayer  dollars  are  being  spent  wisely  to  make  seaports  more  secure. 
Similarly,  as  discussed  earlier  in  describing  the  actions  taken  to  secure  the  cargo 
transiting  through  seaports  in  containers,  performance  measures  are  needed  to  de-
termine the progress such actions are making to reduce vulnerabilities of the inter-
national supply chain. 

A  challenge  exists  in  measuring  progress  in  this  area,  because  seaport  security, 
like many aspects of homeland security, relies upon the coordinated actions of many 
stakeholders and, in many cases, upon ‘‘layers’’ of defenses. In this regard, we have 
pointed  out  that  systems  and  service  standards—which  focus  on  the  performance, 
design, and overall management of processes and activities—hold great potential to 
improve  coordination  across  such  dimensions  and  enhance  measurement  of  contin-
ued  preparedness.21 While  such  standards  are  already  being  used  in  many  parts  of 
the  private  sector,  creation  of  performance  and  results  measures  for  national  secu-
rity in general, and seaport security in particular, remains a work in progress. 
Risk Management Is an Essential Tool for Focusing Efforts Effectively 

Even  with  clear  goals  and  effective  performance  measures,  it  seems  improbable 
that all risk can be eliminated, or that any security framework can successfully an-
ticipate  and  thwart  every  type  of  potential  terrorist  threat  that  highly  motivated, 
well  skilled,  and  adequately  funded  terrorist  groups  could  think  up.  This  is  not  to 
suggest  that  security  efforts  do  not  matter—they  clearly  do.  However,  it  is  impor-
tant  to  keep  in  mind  that  total  security  cannot  be  bought  no  matter  how  much  is 
spent on it. We cannot afford to protect everything against all threats—choices must 
be made about security priorities. Thus, great care needs to be taken to assign avail-
able  resources  to  address  the  greatest  risks,  along  with  selecting  those  strategies 
that make the most efficient and effective use of resources. 

One  approach  to  help  ensure  that  resources  are  assigned  and  appropriate  strate-
gies are selected to address the greatest risks is through risk management—that is, 
defining and reducing risk. A risk management approach is a systematic process for 
analyzing  threats  and  vulnerabilities,  together  with  the  criticality  (that  is,  the  rel-

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  11:29 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025728 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\25728.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

40

ative  importance)  of  the  assets  involved.  This  process  consists  of  a  series  of  analyt-
ical  and  managerial  steps,  basically  sequential,  that  can  be  used  to  assess 
vulnerabilities,  determine  the  criticality  (that  is,  the  relative  importance)  of  the  as-
sets  being  considered,  determine  the  threats  to  the  assets,  and  assess  alternatives 
for  reducing  the  risks.  Once  these  are  assessed  and  identified,  actions  to  improve 
security  and  reduce  the  risks  can  be  chosen  from  the  alternatives  for  implementa-
tion. To be effective, however, this process must be repeated when threats or condi-
tions  change  to  incorporate  any  new  information  to  adjust  and  revise  the  assess-
ments and actions. 

Some  elements  of  risk  management  have  been  incorporated  into  seaport  security 
activities.  For  example,  to  meet  the  requirements  of  MTSA,  security  plans  for  sea-
ports, facilities, and vessels have been developed based on assessments that identify 
their  vulnerabilities.  In  addition,  the  Coast  Guard  is  using  the  Port  Security  Risk 
Assessment  Tool,  which  is  designed  to  prioritize  risk  according  to  a  combination  of 
possible threat, consequence, and vulnerability. Under this approach, seaport infra-
structure  that  is  determined  to  be  both  a  critical  asset  and  a  likely  and  vulnerable 
target  would  be  a  high  priority  for  security  enhancements  or  funding.  By  compari-
son,  infrastructure  that  is  vulnerable  to  attack  but  not  as  critical  or  infrastructure 
that is very critical but already well protected would be lower in priority. In a home-
land  security  setting,  possible  uses  of  data  produced  from  risk  management  efforts 
include  informing  decisions  on  where  the  Federal  Government  might  spend  billions 
of  dollars  within  and  between  federal  departments,  as  well  as  informing  decisions 
on grants awarded to state and local governments. 

As the Nation moves ahead with seaport security efforts, there are plans to incor-
porate  risk  management  as  part  of  the  Nation’s  larger  homeland  security  strategy. 
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7, issued in December 2003, charged DHS 
with integrating the use of risk management into homeland security activities. The 
directive  called  on  the  Department  to  develop  policies,  guidelines,  criteria,  and 
metrics  for  this  effort.  To  meet  this  requirement,  the  Coast  Guard  has  taken  steps 
to  use  risk  management  in  prioritizing  the  protection  of  key  infrastructure  within 
and between seaports. We are currently in the process of assessing the progress the 
Coast  Guard  has  made  in  these  efforts.  In  addition,  we  are  reviewing  the  extent  to 
which  a  risk  management  approach  is  being  used  by  other  DHS  agencies,  such  as 
the  Information  Analysis  and  Infrastructure  Protection  Directorate,  to  evaluate  the 
relative  risk  faced  by  key  infrastructure  within  seaports  and  across  broad  sectors 
of  national  activity,  such  as  seaports  and  aviation,  to  help  ensure  funding  and  re-
sources  are  allocated  to  where  they  are  needed  most.  Our  work  is  still  under  way 
and not far enough along to discuss at this time. It is likely, however, that attention 
to  risk  management  will  be  a  key  part  of  the  ongoing  dialogue  about  the  Nation’s 
homeland security actions in general, and its seaport security actions in particular. 
Concluding Observations 

Managing  the  risks  associated  with  securing  our  Nation’s  seaports  involves  a 
careful  balance  between  the  benefits  of  added  security  and  the  potential  economic 
impacts of security enhancements. While there is broad support for greater security, 
the  national  economy  is  heavily  dependent  on  keeping  goods,  trucks,  trains,  and 
people flowing quickly through seaports, and bringing commerce to a crawl in order 
to  be  completely  safe  carries  its  own  serious  economic  consequences.  Striking  the 
right  balance  between  increased  security  and  protecting  economic  vitality  is  an  im-
portant  and  difficult  task.  Considering  this,  three  things  stand  out  as  important 
from the work we have conducted:

• Seaports are not retreating as a homeland security issue. They are an attractive 
terrorist  target  and  are  likely  to  remain  so,  because  by  their  nature  they  rep-
resent a vulnerability that is always open to potential exploitation.
• Seaport  security  has  lived  up  to  its  billing  as  an  area  in  which  security  meas-
ures  can  be  difficult  to  implement.  The  range  of  activity  in  seaport  areas  can 
be  extremely  wide,  as  can  the  range  of  stakeholders  and  the  fragmentation  of 
responsibility among them. Many of the problems we have identified with indi-
vidual  programs  and  efforts  can  likely  be  overcome  with  time  and  effort,  but 
success  is  not  assured.  We  are  already  seeing  some  efforts,  such  as  the  TWIC 
identification  card,  becoming  deeply  mired  in  problems.  These  activities  will 
thus continue to demand close attention.
• The  national  dialogue  on  this  issue  is  likely  to  focus  increasingly  in  trying  to 
determine  what  we  are  getting  for  our  efforts  and  where  we  should  invest  the 
dollars we have. Therefore, it is critical that federal programs be designed care-
fully  to  try  to  match  the  priorities  and  needs  of  all  partners—federal,  state, 
local,  and  private—and  use  performance  measures  to  effectively  allocate  funds

and resources. On this point, there is work to do, because agencies such as the 
Coast  Guard  currently  lack  a  systematic  approach  for  explaining  the  relation-
ship  between  the  expenditure  of  resources  and  performance  results  in  seaport 
security,  limiting  its  ability  to  critically  examine  its  resource  needs  and 
prioritize  program  efforts.  Providing  answers  also  requires  an  ability  to  care-
fully assess what the key vulnerabilities are and what should be done to protect 
them.  Only  by  doing  this  will  we  have  reasonable  assurance  that  we  are  doing 
the best job with the dollars we have.

Mr.  Chairman,  this  concludes  my  prepared  statement.  I  would  be  pleased  to  an-

swer any questions that you or other Members of the Committee may have.

3 None of the listings in this testimony is meant to be exhaustive of all the efforts 
under  way.  The  Coast  Guard  has  a  range  of  activities  underway  for  reducing  sea-
port  vulnerabilities  that  extends  beyond  the  actions  shown  here.  Such  activities  in-
clude, among others the use of armed boarding officers, formerly known as sea mar-
shals, who board high-interest vessels arriving or departing U.S. seaports and stand 
guard in critical areas of the vessels; the establishment of Maritime Safety and Se-
curity  Teams  (MSST)  to  provide  antiterrorism  protection  for  strategic  shipping, 
high-interest  vessels,  and  critical  infrastructure;  and  the  underwater  port  security 
system, which uses trained divers and robotic cameras to check ship hulls and piers 
and  an  underwater  intruder  detection  system.  We  have  not  evaluated  the  effective-
ness of these activities. 

4 Another  program  to  help  secure  the  overseas  supply  chain  process  is  the  Coast 
Guard’s  International  Port  Security  Program.  In  response  to  being  required  under 
MTSA  to  assess  antiterrorism  measures  maintained  at  foreign  seaports,  the  Coast 
Guard established this program in April 2004 to protect the global shipping industry 
by helping foreign nations evaluate security measures in their seaports. Through bi-
lateral or multilateral discussions, the Coast Guard and the host nations review the 
implementation of security measures against established security standards, such as 
the  International  Maritime  Organization’s  ISPS  Code.  To  conduct  the  program,  the 
Coast Guard has assigned officials to three regions (Asia-Pacific, Europe/Africa/Mid-
dle  East,  and  Central/South  America)  to  facilitate  the  discussions.  In  addition,  a 
Coast Guard team has been established to conduct country/port visits, discuss secu-
rity  measures  implemented,  and  develop  best  practices  between  countries.  Each 
year  the  Coast  Guard  seeks  to  visit  approximately  45  countries  that  conduct  mari-
time trade with the United States.

infrastructure,  and  eliminate  specific  grant  programs  for  port,  rail,  truck,  intercity 
bus,  and  non-governmental  organizations  security.  In  its  Fiscal  Year  2006  budget 
request, the Administration proposed $600 million for TIPP, a $260-million increase 
in  overall  funding  from  Fiscal  Year  2005  for  the  specific  transportation  security 
grant programs. In Fiscal Year 2005, funding for port, rail, truck, intercity bus, and 
non-governmental organizations security totaled $340 million.

GAO recommendations to the U.S. Customs and 

Border Protection

Container Security Initiative 
(CSI) and Customs-Trade 
Partnership Against Ter-
rorism (C–TPAT) 

Develop  human  capital  plans  that  clearly  describe  how  CSI 
and  C–TPAT  will  recruit,  train,  and  retain  staff  to  meet 
their  growing  demands  as  they  expand  to  other  countries 
and  implement  new  program  elements.  These  plans  should 
include up-to-date information on CSI and C–TPAT staffing 
and  training  requirements  and  should  be  regularly  used  by 
managers  to  identify  areas  for  further  human  capital  plan-
ning, including opportunities for improving program results.

Appendix II: Previous GAO Recommendations—Continued

Agency/program 

GAO recommendations 

Expand efforts already initiated to develop performance meas-
ures for CSI and C–TPAT that include outcome-oriented in-
dicators.  These  measures  should  be  tangible,  measurable 
conditions that cover key aspects of performance and should 
enable agencies to assess accomplishments, make decisions, 
realign  processes,  and  assign  accountability.  Furthermore, 
the measures should be used to determine the future direc-
tion of these Customs’ programs. (GAO–03–770) 

Develop strategic plans that clearly lay out CSI and C–TPAT 
goals,  objectives,  and  detailed  implementation  strategies. 
These plans should not only address how the strategies and 
related  resources,  both  financial  and  human,  will  enable 
Customs  to  secure  ocean  containers  bound  for  the  United 
States,  but  also  reinforce  the  connections  between  these 
programs’  objectives  and  both  Customs’  and  the  Depart-
ment  of  Homeland  Security’s  long-term  goals.  (GAO–03–
770) 

Use  its  resources  to  maximize  the  effectiveness  of  its  auto-
mated  targeting  strategy  to  reduce  the  uncertainty  associ-
ated with identifying cargo for additional inspection. (GAO–
04–557T) 

Institute  a  national  inspection  reporting  system.  (GAO–04–

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Did you examine the Port of Los Angeles? 
Ms.  WRIGHTSON.  We  have  been  to  Los  Angeles  numerous  times 
in  the  course  of  working  on  various  requests  for  this  Committee 
and  others.  Los  Angeles/Long  Beach  represents  an  incredibly  crit-
ical  seaport,  and  it  suffers  from  a  lot  of  the  problems  that  are  de-
scribed generally in our reports—from those of TWIC to those of se-
curing facilities and providing adequate patrols. Overall, Los Ange-
les,  like  other  ports,  has  both  security  accomplishments  and  secu-
rity gaps. 

The CHAIRMAN. Did you write a separate report on it? 
Ms.  WRIGHTSON.  We  have  never  issued  a  separate  report  on  Los 
Angeles. And if we did, it probably would have to be classified. We 
wouldn’t be able to present it publicly. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  All  right.  Are  you  aware  of  their  secure  zone 

versus this working zone? 

Ms. WRIGHTSON. Absolutely. 
The CHAIRMAN. Are you critical of that?

Ms.  WRIGHTSON.  Well,  we  would—in  order  to  make  an  informed 
judgment about it—we would need to audit it to see what risks are 
mitigated  and  what  problems  remain.  And  we  haven’t  done  that. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  it  was  pointed  out  to  me  that  no  one  goes 
into that secure zone unless they’re known personally by about five 
other people. 

Ms. WRIGHTSON. All ports—which Admiral Hereth is very able to 
tell you—have security zones around critical infrastructure. So, for 
example,  there’s  a  security  zone  around  Logan  Airport,  there  are 
security  zones  around  most,  and  they  are,  to  various  extents,  pa-
trolled  and  protected.  But  the—I  must  say,  in  general,  the  effi-
cacy—we  have  a  lot  of  effort—the  efficacy  of  these  efforts,  be  they 
for  domestic  security  or  internationally,  still  remain  to  be  deter-
mined.  I  think  it  would  be  an  excellent  area  for  your  future  over-
sight and investigation if we were to look at those. 

The CHAIRMAN. Before he left, Senator Lott told me that we have 
appropriated  a  total  of  $515  million  from  June  2002  through  De-
cember  2003.  Of  that  money,  only  $107  million  had  been  spent  by 
December 2004. Are you familiar with those figures, Admiral? 

Admiral HERETH. I presume you’re talking about the grant—Port 

Security Grant Program, sir? 

The CHAIRMAN. Right. 
Admiral  HERETH.  It  may  be  because  of—the  constraints  on  the 
contracts haven’t been met by the grantees. But I’m not specifically 
familiar with the details of that. I can certainly give you some feed-
back, sir. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Senator  Lott  had  to  go  to  another  meeting,  but 
he’s  very  critical  of  the  rate  of  spending,  in  terms  of  the  security 
aspects of the grants we’ve already made. Would you have someone 
contact  him  and  see  if  we  can  get  an  answer  for  him  of  why  the 
rate of spending for security, specifically appropriated for that pur-
pose is so low? 

Senator Inouye? 
Senator INOUYE. Recently, a report was issued that nearly $8 bil-
lion  worth  of  security  equipment  and  devices  used  by  the  airports 
are  non-functional  or  don’t  serve  the  purpose,  and  will  have  to  be 
thrown  away.  I  presume  you  use  similar  equipment  in  the  ports, 
Mr. Jacksta. 

Mr. JACKSTA. Yes, sir. We have—as I indicated in my opening re-
marks, we do have large-scale X-ray systems at the port of entries, 
at  the  seaports,  somewhere  in  the  area  of  about  56  actually  there, 
to  do  the  VACIS  examination—that’s  an  X-ray  of  the  container  as 
it comes off. We also use equipment such as personal radiation de-
tectors,  which  are  carried  by  the  inspectors,  and  indicate  whether 
there’s  any  type  of  radiological  signature  coming  from  any  of  the 
containers. 

We  also  have,  and  we’re  deploying  right  now,  radiation  portal 
monitors to the major seaports. We already have them installed at 
Newark,  Jacksonville,  and  Boston.  And  this  summer  we’ll  be  put-
ting them at the L.A./Long Beach seaport area. 

Senator INOUYE. And you will continue to employ them, notwith-

standing the fact that the airports find them non-functional? 

Mr. JACKSTA. Well, sir, I don’t know whether the equipment that 
CBP is utilizing at the airports are basically the same type of tech-

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  11:29 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025728 PO 00000 Frm 00051 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\25728.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

48

nology—X-ray  systems.  We  use  that  equipment.  And,  from  our 
knowledge,  the  equipment  is  working  well  in  helping  us  examine 
containers and luggage, that are coming into the United States. 

Senator INOUYE. I would suggest you check them out. 
Mr. Skinner, in your testimony you indicated that—in your grant 
program—that  there  are  a  considerable  number  of  grantees  who 
are not prepared, or don’t know how, to use these funds. Did I hear 
correctly? 

Mr.  SKINNER.  Yes,  sir,  you  did.  Although  we  did  not  go  to  each 
of  the  grantees  to  validate  why,  individually,  the  funds  were  not 
being  spent  in  a  timely  manner,  we  did  note,  during  our  review, 
when  we  questioned  program  officials  about  this,  that  there  was  a 
slow  rate  of  expenditure  because  there  were  considerable  negotia-
tions going on between the Department and the grant recipient try-
ing  to  further  define  what  the  grant  funds  were  to  be  used  for.  In 
other  words,  the  grants  were  awarded  before  we  were  clear  as  to 
exactly what we intended to accomplish with those funds. 

That,  coupled  with  the  fact  that,  at  the  time  we  were  doing  our 
review,  there  was  only  one  individual  that  had  responsibility  for 
providing  oversight  and  monitoring  of  those  grants,  and,  as  a  re-
sult,  the  slow  spending  rate  was  never  brought  to  light  until  late 
2004, early 2005. 

Senator  INOUYE.  Over  the  years,  I’ve  learned  that  just  about 
every  department,  bureau,  and  section  provides  some  sort  of  grant 
program,  and  it’s  not  easy  to  get  these  grants.  Very  competitive. 
And most of them are highly qualified. How is it that, in your area, 
you  say  most  of  them  don’t  know  how  to  use  the  funds  or  have  no 
experience? 

Mr. SKINNER. No, sir. What we were saying was that the grantee 
was not prepared to use the funds. In other words, their grant ap-
plication was not specific enough to allow the Department to deter-
mine what we were going to get for our money. So, once the grant 
was then awarded, negotiations took place. 

Senator  INOUYE.  And  not  withstanding  that,  the  grant  was  ap-

proved? 

Mr. SKINNER. That’s correct, sir. 
Senator INOUYE. Did someone evaluate the grant application? 
Mr.  SKINNER.  Yes,  sir.  It  went  through  a  very  intensive  evalua-

tion process, both at——

Senator INOUYE. But with that intensive——
Mr. SKINNER.—the field and headquarters level. 
Senator INOUYE.—you didn’t see this. 
Mr. SKINNER. I beg your pardon, sir? 
Senator INOUYE. You didn’t see the shortcoming. With the inten-

sive——

Mr.  SKINNER.  Evidently  not.  This  was  not  universal.  There  may 
be  other  reasons  why  the  moneys  were  not  spent.  We  did  not  go 
down  to  the  grantee  level.  What  we  did  identify,  however,  like  I 
said,  was,  the  fact  that  there  was  considerable  negotiations  going 
on which delayed the actual expenditure of funds. 

Senator  INOUYE.  Well,  did  you  find  when  these  funds  were  not 
properly  used,  that  they  were  taken  back?  Did  the  agency  seek  a 
return——

49

Mr. SKINNER. It’s not that they were not properly used; they just 
were  not  used  at  all.  They  were  still  available  for  use.  And  once 
the  Department  was  satisfied  how  the  funds  would,  in  fact,  be 
used—after  the  award,  after  the  fact—then  I  would  suspect  that 
they would then apply those funds and expend them. 

Senator INOUYE. Thank you very much. 
Just  prior  to  your  testimony,  the  Congressman  testified,  indi-
cating  that  it  takes  over  a  year  to  get  the  security  clearance,  and 
that  there  are  450,000  awaiting  clearance.  Is  that  the  situation  in 
the ports? 

Mr.  JACKSTA.  Well,  I’d  like  to  begin  by  saying  that,  from  CBP’s 
perspective,  we  have  our  officers  and  the  supervisors  that  are  en-
gaged  with  the  examination  and  making  decisions  on  what  to  in-
spect.  They  have  that  type  of  clearance.  We  ensure  that  the  intel-
ligence and information that’s required to get to the CBP officer is 
getting  to  the  actual  location  and  to  the  officers  who  need  to  have 
that information. So, although we would like to have more individ-
uals with security clearance, the agency does have people available 
who get that information and look at it. 

Senator INOUYE. Admiral? 
Admiral HERETH. Yes, sir. I can add a little bit to that. We, since 
9/11,  have  set  up  our  own  security  center.  We  process  our  own  se-
curity  clearances  for  all  the  members  of  the  Coast  Guard  and  our 
employees.  That’s  going  fine.  We’ve  also  taken  the  step  to  go  back 
to  the  Department  and  get  authorization  to  get  up  to  800  clear-
ances  for  members  of  industry  and/or  trade  associations.  And,  as 
the  Congressman  pointed  out,  we  think  that’s  a  key  feature  that 
needs to be implemented quickly. And we have distributed author-
izations  around  the  country.  We  have  43  Area  Maritime  Security 
Committees,  and  we’ve  asked  our  Captains  of  the  Port  to  serve  as 
the  focal  points  to  identify  people  in  the  Area  Committees  appro-
priate  industry-segment  representatives  that  we  could  commu-
nicate  with,  that  could  get—you  know,  get  clearances,  authorized 
security  clearances,  so  we  can  talk  to  them  about  secret  informa-
tion  and  pass  current  information  in  an  appropriate,  timely,  and 
transparent fashion. We believe that’s a hugely positive step. 

We can process those clearances in a timely fashion. I don’t think 
it would take anywhere near a year, but it’s going to take a month 
or two to get them through the system, but the challenge is getting 
the  members  who  want  the  clearance  to  fill  out  the—I  think  it’s  a 
17-page  form.  We  struggle  on  that  front.  But  we’re  trying  to  push 
through that. We’re trying to do that as quickly as we can, because 
we  think  that’s  an  important  part  of  the  communication  process 
that  needs  to  happen  between  the  regulatory  agencies—Coast 
Guard,  in  particular—and  the  industry  segments  that  we  work 
with in the maritime. 

Senator INOUYE. Ms. Wrightson? 
Ms.  WRIGHTSON.  Thank  you,  I  want  to  add  to  Admiral  Hereth’s 
comments  that—to  shed  some  light  on  this—in  terms  of  what’s 
going  on  at  ports  with  Area  Maritime  Security  Committees,  that’s 
the  group  Congressman  Ruppersberger  was  talking  about—these 
were  the  361  people  that  the  Coast  Guard  immediately  designated 
as  in  need  of  clearances.  Of  those  361,  only  28  had  applied,  4 
months  after  the  fact.  When  we  went  in  and  audited  it,  we  found

three things as key explanatory factors. First, there was an insuffi-
cient understanding of what they were supposed to do by—by they 
I  mean  these  private  parties  and  local  officials.  Second,  there  was 
confusion on the part of Coast Guard onsite, as to what their roles 
and  responsibilities  were.  And,  third—and  this  is  very  important, 
going  forward—we  found  limitations  in  the  management  informa-
tion system that the Coast Guard had to troubleshoot problems. 

As it always does, the Coast Guard is very nimble and has been 
very responsive to the recommendations that we’ve made to correct 
these problems, so one would anticipate improvements there. How-
ever,  it  appeared—correct  me  if  I’m  wrong—that  the  Coast  Guard 
may  be  getting  this  as  larger  responsibility  for  DHS.  Has  that 
changed, or is there still talk of that? 

Admiral HERETH. There must be still talk of that. Our focus has 
been  getting  the—in  the  instant,  getting  those  800  clearances  in 
position  so  we  can  actually  talk,  at  the  secret  level,  with  industry 
representatives,  along  with  a  handful  of  representatives  inside  the 
beltway.  Because  the  trade  associations—and  I  think  there’s  32 
that  we’re  linked  with  here  inside  the  beltway—provide  a  key  role 
in linking back to their members. And the credibility and the time-
liness of getting information out hinges on getting those clearances 
in  place,  we  think.  It  will  be  a  much  more  effective  system  and  a 
very—and a step forward for all of us. 

Ms.  WRIGHTSON.  And  if  DHS  piggybacks  on  the  Coast  Guard’s 
better  efforts  in  this  area,  it’ll  return  us  to  the  other  issues  I 
raised, which is the sustainability of the resources the Coast Guard 
has  to  do  this  work,  and  that  is  a  very  large  list  of  requirements. 
And  whether  or  not  the  Coast  Guard  has  the  resources—they  al-
ways have the will—to do it is a different question. 

Admiral  HERETH.  One  other  add-on  item,  sir,  if  I  might?  We  en-
visioned  an  Internet  portal  available  to  industry  segments,  pass-
word-protected,  appropriately  secure,  to  pass  sensitive,  but  unclas-
sified,  information.  That’s  another  important  link,  to  share  infor-
mation  in  a  continuing  basis  with  our  industry  representatives  so 
that  we  get  information  quickly  about  threat—changing  threats, 
threat  advisories,  threat  bulletins  that  might  be  useful  to  various 
industry  segments.  And  we’ve  done  a  beta  test  now  in  eight  ports, 
and  the  response  has  been  very  positive,  so  we’re  going  to  move 
ahead  and  implement  such  a  system.  That’s  part  of  the  Homeland 
Security  Information  Net,  but  it’s  an  Internet  portal  that  will  be 
accessible to industry. 

Senator  INOUYE.  Well,  I  thank  all  of  you  for  the  service  you’re 

rendering to the Nation. Thank you very much. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER,

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
A  couple  of  thoughts,  questions.  You  have,  on  the—Mr.  Skinner, 
you  have—on  the  first  page  of  your  GAO  highlights,  you  have  this 
interesting statement, ‘‘This testimony makes no recommendations, 
but  cites  several  reports  in  which  recommendations  were  pre-

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  11:29 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025728 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\25728.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

51

viously  made.’’  In  view  of  what  I’ve  been  hearing  this  morning,  I 
find that very worrisome. 

The—I  would  understand,  I  guess,  that  inspectors  general  are 
meant  to,  sort  of,  comment  on  the  state  of  matters,  but  the  state 
of  matters  strikes  me,  in  all  of  this  discussion,  as  one  of  the  more 
depressing conditions of moving forward toward homeland security 
at the port level that I could have possibly imagined. And I wonder 
why  it  is  that  you—Ms.  Wrightson,  you  referred  to  having  made 
recommendations  to  one  of  the  panelists,  but  you  can’t  make  rec-
ommendations to the public——

Ms. WRIGHTSON. Oh, no, that is an incorrect interpretation. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER.—or to the Congress. 
Ms. WRIGHTSON.—OK. That’s a very good question. But what the 
sentence  really  means  is  that  there  are  no  recommendations  con-
tained  in  this  written  summary  statement;  however,  on  page  32  of 
the  statement,  there  follows  three  pages  of  detailed  recommenda-
tions that we have provided in prior reports and are publicly avail-
able  in  the  backs  of  each  of  the  individual  reports  we  used  to  pre-
pare  my  statement  and  they  are  recommendations  for  improve-
ments in all of the problem areas I cited. 

So, for example, in the program that the Admiral and I were just 
talking  about,  GAO  recommended  an—to  take  better  advantage  of 
the management-information system, to develop clearer guidance to 
the ports, and to facilitate—adopt DOD practices that might assist 
in facilitating stakeholders to fill out their applications. So——

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Previous——
Ms. WRIGHTSON.—there’s a huge——
Senator ROCKEFELLER.—GAO recommendations——
Ms. WRIGHTSON.—list of recommendations, and they’re public. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Previous. 
Ms.  WRIGHTSON.  Well,  some  of  them  were  issued  very  recently; 
all  are  outstanding  and  need  to  be  completed  by  the  responsible 
agencies. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. All right. 
Ms. WRIGHTSON. And you would consider these to be——
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Well, let me——
Ms. WRIGHTSON.—recommendations I’m making——
Senator ROCKEFELLER.—let me——
Ms. WRIGHTSON.—today. 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.—I’m  just—I’m  just  a  little  struck,  frank-
ly, by the sort of calmness at the table—at yours, that is, all of you. 
Mr.  Jacksta,  you  started  out  with,  kind  of,  a  list  of  all  the  good 
things  that  are  being  done.  You,  sir,  were  very  pleased  with  what 
the  Coast  Guard  is  doing.  And  you  both  talked  about  what  you 
talked about. But I just——

West Virginia is not a large state, but we have the seventh-larg-
est inland port in the country, and I think that you’re about to shift 
most—a  lot  of  our  workers  to  Louisville.  I  don’t  know  whether 
that’s  true  or  not.  I  don’t  get  a—I  never  have  had  a  feeling  about 
Homeland Security that there was any coordination. 

And  it  may  have  been  that  the  President  was  right  when  he 
had—his first instinct was not to do it at all, but to somehow figure 
out  another  system,  that  the  melding  of  22  agencies,  or  27,  or 
whatever it was, Mr. Chairman, just wasn’t going to work. I—well, 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  11:29 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025728 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\25728.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

52

I know we finally did it, and then—and he agreed to it. But it may 
have been that he was right to be skeptical. 

I’m on the Intelligence Committee, as the Congressman was who 
testified earlier, and it’s nothing but a litany of total lack of prepa-
ration  wherever  we  turn.  And  we  have  this  fascination  with  any-
thing  that  goes  wrong  in  Afghanistan  or  Iraq  or  anywhere  else, 
and,  obviously,  9/11  and  things  that  go  on  even  not  of  that  mag-
nitude  here,  but  the  concept  of  preparedness  is  a  uniquely  Amer-
ican one, where everybody waits on everybody else. I really believe 
that.  That’s  not  to  be—to  pick  out—on  you,  in  particular,  but  I 
think that, generally speaking, people wait for others. 

I  mean,  I  don’t—this  whole  question  about  why  grants  aren’t 
being  used  and—well,  maybe  they’re  not  ready  to  use  them,  or 
they’re  not  cleared  to  use  them,  and  the  waiting  lists,  and  all  the 
rest of it—it just—I’m just struck by the calmness of all of you, and 
by  the,  sort  of,  satisfaction  you  have  as  you  describe  what  it  is 
you’re  doing,  even  though  on  your  end  you’re  describing  some  of 
your  frustrations,  and  then  you  have,  I  guess,  two  pages—32  and 
33—of recommendations, some of them being previous. 

Are you all hooked up onto the same computer system? ‘‘You,’’ 27 

agencies? Are you interoperable? 

Mr. JACKSTA. There is the exchange of information, yes. CBP ex-
changes  information  with  the  Coast  Guard  on  a  regular  basis.  We 
have  people  that  are  working  together,  both  at  our  National  Tar-
geting  Center,  as  well  as  at  the  Coast  Guard  Intelligence  Center, 
to  make  sure  that  the  information  is,  first  of  all,  getting—being 
looked at and making sure that it’s getting out to our offices in the 
field. We have information provided by other agencies at our NTC. 
We have the FBI. We have TSA. We have ICE. We have a number 
of Coast Guard. So, there’s people sitting there 24-by-7, working to-
gether, exchanging information. 

So,  I  think,  sir,  there  is  a  sense  of  urgency  that—here,  in  the 
sense  that  we  feel  that  it’s  important  for  us  to  continue  to  work, 
to exchange information, to get the equipment out there as fast as 
possible  so  that  we  can  do  the  screening  of  the  cargo  and  con-
tainers. We have systems in place that have the——

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  But  you  can  be—but  what  is  it?  I’ve  al-
ways  thought  it  was  about  5  percent  of  cargo  that  was  getting 
screened. What did you say it was? 

Mr. JACKSTA. Right now, in Fiscal Year 2004, sir, for the seaport-
side-of-the-house  containers,  we  screen  approximately  5.5  percent 
of the——

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Yes, 5 percent. I mean, how do you, kind 
of, live with that? In other words, do you have a chart in your mind 
which  tells  you  how  you  get  to  15,  then  to  50,  then  to  75  percent, 
then to 100 percent? I mean, do you have a clear idea of what has 
to  be  done?  In  other  words,  if  you’re  all  getting  shafted  by  OMB 
or—were  any  of  your  testimonies  cleared  by  OMB  before  you  gave 
them? 

Ms. WRIGHTSON. We didn’t clear ours with OMB. 
Mr. SKINNER. No, sir, ours was not. 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  You  understand  the  little  problem  with 
that, right? In other words, even if you had different thoughts, you 
couldn’t  say  them,  because  OMB  has  to  clear  them.  So,  how  do

you—before  you  go  to  sleep  at  night,  how  do  you  figure  out  how 
you’re going to get to 25, 50, and 100? Everybody knows Homeland 
Security  is  underfunded.  Everybody  in  the  world  knows  it’s  under-
funded.  Do  you  ever  take  it  higher  up?  You’re  acting—you’re  Dep-
uty Director, right? 

I’m  finished.  I’m  just—I’m  angry.  I’m  angry,  Mr.  Chairman.  You 

occasionally get angry; not very often. 

The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman on your right is, too. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Is he? OK. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Thank you very much.

STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG,

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
First, I ask that my opening statement be included in the record 

as if read. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Lautenberg follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG,

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing on this important subject. 
I served on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey before coming to the 
Senate  in  1983.  So  I  have  long  been  aware  of  the  vital  role  our  ports  play  in  our 
Nation’s economy . . . as well as potential security risks at our ports. 

Obviously, the importance of port security increased exponentially after 9/11. The 
9/11 Commission warned that we must not make the mistake of assuming that the 
next  attack  on  our  Nation  will  be  the  same  as  the  last  one.  We  have  invested  bil-
lions  of  dollars  to  improve  the  security  of  our  commercial  aviation  system.  But  I 
worry  that  we  have  not  done  enough  to  secure  other  potential  targets—especially 
our ports. To put it bluntly: we still haven’t gotten serious about port security. 

Mr.  Chairman,  our  Nation  has  more  than  one  thousand  harbor  channels,  and  25 
thousand  miles  of  waterways  serving  360  ports.  Obviously,  we  cannot  monitor  ev-
erything that happens on every one of these waterways 100 percent of the time. But 
if  we  were  serious  about  port  security,  we  would  focus  on  the  ports  and  waterways 
that are most at risk. 

Unfortunately, this hasn’t been the case. According to the FBI, a two-mile stretch 
between  Port  Newark  and  the  Newark  Airport  is  the  Number  One  potential  target 
for terrorists in the entire country. Despite this high risk, New Jersey received only 
three  percent  of  the  port  security  grants  distributed  by  the  Department  of  Home-
land  Security  last  year.  This  was  not  nearly  enough  for  a  state  that  has  two  of  the 
largest ports in the country. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  realize  that  every  Senator  always  fights  for  resources  for  his  or 
her  state.  But  when  it  comes  to  Homeland  Security,  we  should  place  the  safety  of 
the American people above pork-barrel politics. The Maritime Security Act that the 
Senate  unanimously  approved  last  year  included  my  legislation  adopting  a  strict 
risk-based  standard  for  port  security  grants.  Unfortunately,  the  House  never  acted 
on  that  bill.  The  DHS  Inspector  General  has  confirmed  that  the  Port  Security  Pro-
gram did NOT award previous grants on the basis of risk assessment. 

DHS recently announced it is accepting applications for a new round of port secu-
rity  grants  totaling  $140  million.  I  strongly  urge  DHS  to  follow  the  recommenda-
tions  of  its  own  Inspector  General,  and  use  a  strict  assessment  of  risk  in  deter-
mining which requests are granted. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  you  once  again  for  this  hearing.  I  also  thank  our  wit-
nesses, and I look forward to hearing what they have to say about the urgent issue 
of securing our Nation’s seaports.

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  I  make  a  note  there  that  I  was  Commis-
sioner  of  the  Port  Authority  of  New  York  and  New  Jersey  when  I 
came  to  the  Senate,  and  I’m  very  much  aware  of  what  the  signifi-
cance  is  of  our  ports  to  our  general  well-being,  $740  billion  a  year

added  to  our  gross  domestic  product  as  a  result  of  that.  I’m  very 
much aware. Also I want to commend each one of you for your ex-
cellent  testimony.  I  may  view  things  a  little  differently,  because  I 
supply  the  freneticism  and  you  don’t  have  to,  but  you  do  have  to 
supply  the  facts,  as  you  did,  and  they  were  wonderfully  con-
structed, and I commend you. 

And  one  of  the  things  that  the  group  at  this  table  have  in  com-
mon is that, we’re all very much supportive of the Coast Guard, the 
work  that  you  do,  Admiral,  and  the  number  of  assignments  that 
continue  to  grow.  Yet  we  heard  from  Mr.  Jacksta  that  the  fleet  is 
aged.  I’m  aware  of  that,  since  I’m  aged  and  I  have  seen  a  lot  of 
these  boats  around  for  a  long  time.  But  the  fact  of  the  matter  is 
that I don’t think that we’ve given enough resources to this—to our 
needs. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  that  when  we  look  at  where  we  are,  that 
we  fail  to  recognize  that  the  other  front  from  the  Middle  East  is 
right  here  at  home,  and  that  we  have  to  spend  according  to  our 
needs. And we’ve spent 250—we’ve appropriated $250 billion so far 
for  the  war  effort  in  Iraq—and  I’m  for  it,  all  the  way,  in  order  to 
do  the  best  we  can  for  our  troops  and  to  conclude  the  task  we’ve 
taken  on  there—additonally  we’re  about  to  add  $50  billion  in  the 
Defense bill to help the war in Iraq be pursued. 

When we look at the home front—and I am reminded—we’re for-
tunate  to  have  distinguished  Chairman/Co–Chairman  of  this  Com-
mittee,  people  who  have  experienced  war  up  front  and  know  what 
you need to protect yourself, and how you fight. This is the second 
front.  And  I  remind  the  distinguished  Senator  from  Hawaii,  who 
wears the Congressional Medal of Honor, that at the time of Pearl 
Harbor,  who  lost,  I  think  it  is,  Senator  Inouye,  2,400  people,  and 
on  9/11,  almost  3,000  people.  This  tells  us  something  about  where 
the risk is. It’s at home too. 

So  when  we  look  at  what  the  Coast  Guard  recommended,  Mr. 
Chairman,  for  our  security  needs,  we  talked  about  something  over 
$7  billion  for  the  decade.  And  we’re  talking  about  $140  million  to 
be  distributed,  of  which  my  State  of  New  Jersey,  with  one  of  the 
busiest  ports  in  the  country,  will  likely  get  3  percent,  $4  million. 
It  just  isn’t  enough  money  to  do  the  job.  And  I  think  Senator 
Rockefeller  indicated  that  it  isn’t.  We  don’t  recognize  the  signifi-
cance. We don’t recognize the risk. 

As a matter of fact, if you look out here and you see the railroad 
tracks, and you know that some of those cars carry toxic chemicals; 
enough,  it’s  said,  to  endanger  thousands  of  people  here;  an  attack 
on a plant, a chemical plant in New Jersey, could endanger 12 mil-
lion  people.  What  if  chlorine  gas  was  involved?  If  chlorine’s  in-
volved, that’s going to be the effect. 

And  so,  Admiral,  I  ask  you,  What’s  the  status  of  your  personnel 

levels now? 

Admiral  HERETH.  We’ve  been  about—since  2001,  focused  on 
MTSA  implementation—port-security  work,  specifically.  We’ve  in-
creased our numbers by about 800. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. That’s from where? What was the base? 
Admiral  HERETH.  I  can’t  quote  you  the  specific  base,  but,  at  our 
Marine  Safety  Offices,  we  probably  had  2,500  people;  in  our  group 
offices,  we  had  another  2,500  people.  So,  we’re  now  in  the  process

of  homogenizing  those  to  gain  some  synergy  in  terms  of  perform-
ance.  So,  we  have  a  number  of  folks  in  the  Coast  Guard  focused 
specifically on those missions area. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Right. But on the total personnel in Coast 
Guard,  are  you  familiar  with  that  figure—the  total  requirement 
that are being met now by Coast Guard, fully, with its navigation, 
pollution  control,  refugee 
interception,  et  cetera,  et  cetera? 
What——

Admiral HERETH. I can’t quote you a figure, sir——
Senator LAUTENBERG. OK. 
Admiral HERETH.—we’ll get——
Senator LAUTENBERG. I know that you’re short, and I know that 
you’ve  got  these  old  vessels.  And  I  see  the  guys  on  the  Hudson 
River patrolling in rubber boats—in rigid-hull boats out there in all 
kinds of weather. 

Mr.  Chairman,  it’s  just—we’re  not  doing  enough  to  protect  our 
people  in  this  second  front,  as  I  call  it,  at  home,  where  we  see  the 
possibility of disaster all across our country. But we look at it par-
ticularly in places that are most obvious. Aviation, we spend a ton 
of  money,  and  don’t  do  it  quite  as  good  as  we  ought  to.  And  that’s 
part  of  growing  pains.  And  if  one  doesn’t  understand  what  the 
transition  is  from  a  relatively  peacetime  structure  into  the  kind  of 
security needs we have, then one is kidding oneself. And we ought 
to  be  finding  ways  to  finance  the  war  at  home  in  sufficient  terms. 
$7.2  billion  recommended  by  the  Coast  Guard  for  port  security 
over  the  next  10  years,  and  we  don’t  come  anywhere  near  it  with 
$140  million  proposed  for  this  year.  And  we  spend—and  we’re 
spending over—will have spent at least $300 billion defending Iraq, 
trying  to  help  them  get  their  institutions,  their  infrastructure  to-
gether.  Over  $300  billion.  And  what  about  the  ports  of  New  York 
and Louisiana and across the ocean in Hawaii and Alaska? 

Mr.  Chairman,  we  have  to  look  at  these  problems.  These  wit-
nesses were excellent. I appreciate your presentations. I thank you, 
Mr. Chairman, for having this hearing. 

The CHAIRMAN. Senator Inouye, any further comments? 
Senator INOUYE. No, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. Gentlemen, we thank you all very much, and ap-
preciate  your—as  Senator  Inouye  said,  appreciate  your  service.  I 
think  you’re  doing  a  marvelous  job  with  what  you  have.  I  didn’t 
agree  with  Homeland  Security,  but  we  have  to  pay  for  what  is 
there  now,  and  the  gentlemen  are  right  about  that.  But  it’s  one  of 
those things. Thank you very much. 

We’ll  now  turn  to  panel  two:  Ms.  Jean  Godwin,  Vice  President, 
American  Association  of  Port  Authorities;  and  Mr.  Christopher 
Koch, President and Chief Executive Officer of the World Shipping 
Council. 

All of the statements that were filed this morning will appear in 
the  record  as  though  read.  And,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  I  forgot,  I 
would  put  my  opening  statement  in  the  record,  as  well  as  Senator 
Inouye’s.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

56

Thank you, Senator Inouye, for requesting to chair this important hearing and for 

your commitment to the security of our Nation’s ports. 

I welcome the witnesses who are here today and I thank you for your willingness 
to  appear  to  discuss  the  security  of  our  Nation’s  maritime  system.  Today’s  hearing 
is  one  in  a  series  of  hearings  that  the  Committee  has  held  and  will  hold  to  fulfill 
its  oversight  responsibilities  with  respect  to  port  security.  The  Committee  will  con-
tinue  to  exercise  its  jurisdiction  over  these  matters  as  we  work  to  develop  ways  to 
further  improve  the  security  of  all  modes  of  transportation,  including  the  security 
of our ports. 

While the Coast Guard and TSA have made progress since September 11th to bol-
ster port security, including this Committee’s work on the Maritime Transportation 
Security Act, much more remains to be done. To date, the Department of Homeland 
Security  still  has  not  yet  fully  implemented  the  requirements  of  the  Act,  and  some 
programs  have  lagged  behind  for  a  variety  of  reasons.  The  challenge  that  we  face 
in securing our ports is assessing vulnerabilities and allocating limited resources in 
an effective and efficient manner to mitigate those vulnerabilities. We must also do 
a better job of developing and utilizing technologies to reduce labor costs and to im-
prove our ability to detect cargo that threatens our national security. 

Senator Inouye. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 
I  would  like  to  thank  my  friend,  Chairman  Ted  Stevens,  for  calling  this  hearing 
today  and  for  allowing  the  Committee  to  exercise  one  of  its  most  essential  duties: 
oversight of the nation’s seaport security system. 

Port security is of particular importance to us because our states are entirely de-
pendent upon the uninterrupted flow of maritime commerce. Many still do not real-
ize  that  the  entire  Nation’s  economic  livelihood  depends  on  the  continuous  flow  of 
cargo as well. 

Maritime  commerce  is  the  lifeblood  of  international  trade,  and  the  United  States 
is  the  world’s  leading  maritime  trading  nation,  accounting  for  20  percent  of  global 
trade. Ninety-five percent of our Nation’s cargo comes through the ports. Our econ-
omy  is  dependent  on  our  seaports,  and  whether  you  live  on  the  coasts  or  in  the 
heartland, maritime commerce affects the daily lives of every American. 

I commend the U.S. Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration and 
the  Bureau  of  Customs  and  Border  Protection,  on  their  progress  over  the  past  3 
years  in  implementing  the  Maritime  Transportation  Security  Act  to  make  seaports 
more  secure  both  here  and  abroad.  There  is  much  more  that  needs  to  be  done,  and 
we  must  move  ahead.  We  cannot  become  complacent.  We  have  built  a  foundation, 
and now it is time to build the house. 

The terrorists that seek to do us harm are cunning, dynamic, and most of all, pa-
tient.  While  they  have  not  successfully  struck  our  homeland  since  September  11, 
2001,  it  does  not  mean  that  they  are  not  preparing  to  do  so.  They  work  24  hours 
a  day,  studying  what  we  do  and  how  we  do  it.  It  is  imperative  that  we  stay  ahead 
of them. That means we must constantly anticipate, innovate, and plan. 

We  must  continually  research  and  implement  the  most  effective  technologies.  We 

must recruit, train and deploy the most skilled security force. 

Later  today,  Senators  Stevens,  Rockefeller,  and  I  will  be  introducing  the  Trans-
portation  Security  Improvement  Act  of  2005,  and  port  and  cargo  security  improve-
ments are central elements of this legislation. 

Among  its  port  security  provisions,  our  legislation  seeks  to  improve  interagency 
cooperation  with  the  further  development  of  joint  operation  command  centers.  It 
clarifies  the  roles  and  responsibilities  for  cargo  security  programs,  while  estab-
lishing  criteria  for  contingency  response  plans  to  resume  the  flow  of  Commerce  in 
the event of a seaport attack. 

By setting a minimum floor for research and development funding related to mari-
time and land security, the bill further encourages the development of effective tech-
nologies  that  detect  terrorist  threats.  Finally,  we  make  the  port  security  grant  pro-
gram more risk-based and allow for multi-year funding of port security projects. 

Today’s hearing on port security will be the first in a series of hearings on trans-
portation  security  broadly,  as  we  evaluate  ways  to  further  strengthen  the  security 
of our ports, our aviation and rail systems, our economy, and our Nation. 

I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  our  witnesses  today  on  how  we  can  continue  to 

strengthen our maritime security system.

The CHAIRMAN. We’ll proceed first with you, Ms. Godwin. 
And we’re pleased to hear your testimony. Thank you. 

STATEMENT  OF  JEAN  GODWIN,  EXECUTIVE  VICE  PRESIDENT/
GENERAL  COUNSEL,  AMERICAN  ASSOCIATION  OF  PORT
AUTHORITIES 
Ms. GODWIN. Thank you. Chairman Stevens and Members of the 
Committee,  we  appreciate  the  invitation.  And,  more  importantly, 
we  very  much  appreciate  the  leadership  and  the  support  that  this 
Committee  has  shown  for  security  needs  and  the  Port  Security 
Grant Program. 

I noticed a lot of passion in your questions. I appreciate Senator 
Inouye’s  note  at  the  beginning  about  the  funding  disparities,  the 
amount that’s going to airports versus seaports. And we know that 
the Members of this Committee have our interests in mind and are 
always out looking to try to help us. 

As  you  know,  the  Port  Security  Grant  Program  was  established 
to  provide  financial  assistance  to  protect  our  vital  ports  of  entry 
from  terrorism.  Since  9/11,  ports  have  invested  hundreds  of  mil-
lions of their own dollars to increase their security. While the grant 
program  has  provided  much-needed  support  to  reimburse  ports  for 
some  of  their  security  costs,  in  the  first  four  rounds,  as  you’ve 
heard,  federal  funding  has  amounted  to  only  $565  million,  which 
was a sixth of what was requested. The fifth round, announced last 
week,  will  provide  $141  million,  but  actually  limits  eligibility  to 
only  66  designated  port  areas.  I  encourage  you  all  to  look  at  the 
most  recent  round.  I  know  some  of  that  was  done  in  response  to 
the  report  criticizing  the  way  that  the  program  was  funded.  But, 
essentially, what they have done is decided to say some port areas 
are  not  even  eligible  to  try  to  compete,  not  even  to  try  to  make 
their case that they deserve funding; and only those who are eligi-
ble to even submit applications will be judged. 

Through  the  first  four  rounds  of  grants,  funds  have  been  pro-
vided to coastal states, including Alaska and Hawaii, but the value 
of the program, of course, is not just to coastal states. With 95 per-
cent of our overseas trade flowing through our ports, all states and 
all  citizens  would  be  negatively  affected  by  a  shutdown  of  our  sea-
ports. 

This  program’s  been  bounced  around  among  various  agencies.  It 
started at MarAd. It was moved to TSA. And then, actually, exactly 
1  year  ago  today,  May  17th,  it  officially  became  part  of  the  DHS 
Office  of  State  and  Local  Government  Coordination  Preparedness. 
I  know  that  Members  of  this  Committee  joined  AAPA  in  raising 
concerns  in  the  context  of  that  move,  to  make  sure  that  the  Port 
Security  Grant  Program  would  remain  a  separate  line  item.  And 
we were all assured at the time that it would. Unfortunately, fast-
forward  months  later,  and  we’ve  seen  the  Administration’s  2006 
budget  proposal,  which  would  eliminate  our  grant  program  and 
combine  us  into  a  critical  infrastructure  program,  along  with 
trucks, trains, buses, public transit, and energy facilities. This is a 
proposal  that  we  strongly  oppose.  We  think  it’s  contrary  to  what 
this Committee intended last year in the Coast Guard reauthoriza-
tion bill, which authorized a separate grant program for port secu-
rity  based  on  MTSA.  Just  last  week,  the  House  Appropriations

Committee  voted  to  reject  lumping  these  together  and  said  that 
they  want  to  see  the  Port  Security  Grant  Program  remain  a  sepa-
rate  line  item.  And  we  certainly  would  ask  for  your  support  in 
making sure that that is a Senate decision, as well. 

Our economy, our safety, and our national defense depend large-
ly on how we can protect our seaports. According to the 9/11 Com-
mission  report,  opportunities  to  do  harm  are  as  great,  or  greater, 
in  maritime  as  they  are  at  airports.  And  I’ve  heard  several  of  you 
reiterate that this morning. We must focus on protection at all sea-
ports, since ports serve as an international border, and an incident 
at one would surely impact all. Rather than limiting the eligibility, 
to  certain  geographic  areas—we  urge  DHS  to  refocus  the  program 
on  MTSA  while  including  a  cross-check  to  the  critical  infrastruc-
ture plan. 

We  also  urge  this  Committee  to  take  a  leadership  role  in  advo-
cating for stronger funding for the current Port Security Grant Pro-
gram  in  the  2006  appropriations  process.  The  Coast  Guard  did 
originally estimate we’d have to spend about $5.4 billion over a 10-
year period to comply with MTSA for facility security, and we have 
urged a funding level of $400 million for FY06. 

With  cargo  volumes  expected  to  double  over  the  next  15  years, 
seaports across the country are expanding to meet the growing de-
mand  for  their  services,  necessitating  huge  expenditures  in  infra-
structure, equipment, and personnel that top $3 billion a year. Un-
fortunately,  in  order  to  pay  for  security  enhancements,  ports  may 
have to divert funds needed to make capital investments to handle 
this future trade growth. We need the Federal Government to pro-
vide its share of security costs—this is a partnership—to make sure 
that  our  ports  are  secure  today  and  will  be  able  to  meet  the  chal-
lenges  and  opportunities  of  accommodating  the  world  trade  needs 
of tomorrow. 

Finally,  we’d  also  like  to  voice  our  support  for  the  TWIC  pro-
gram,  which  you’ve  discussed  earlier.  We  urge  increased  funding 
for  the  program,  and  also  encourage  DHS  to  enact  the  program 
quickly. We share some of the frustrations you heard earlier. 

We appreciate your leadership. We stand ready to do our part in 
protecting  America.  And,  again,  we  urge  you  to  voice  your  support 
for  a  stronger  appropriation  in  2006  and  a  separate  line  item  for 
the Port Security Grant Program. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JEAN GODWIN, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT/GENERAL 

COUNSEL, AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PORT AUTHORITIES 

Good morning. I am Jean Godwin, Executive Vice President and General Counsel 
for  the  American  Association  of  Port  Authorities  (AAPA).  I  thank  you  for  inviting 
us  to  testify  before  your  Committee  on  the  implementation  of  the  Maritime  Trans-
portation  Security  Act  and  vulnerabilities  that  remain  in  the  maritime  transpor-
tation sector. AAPA is an alliance of the leading public ports in the Western Hemi-
sphere and our testimony today reflects the views of our U.S. members. 

Prior  to  9/11,  security  was  not  a  top  concern  for  most  ports.  9/11  changed  that 
and  Congress  and  the  Administration  took  quick  action  to  help  focus  ports  on  this 
new risk. Enhancing maritime security and protecting America’s seaports from acts 
of  terrorism  and  other  federal  crimes  is  now  a  top  priority  for  AAPA  and  U.S.  port 
authorities.  Much  has  been  done  since  9/11,  but  more  is  needed.  Protecting  Amer-
ica’s ports is critical to our Nation’s economic growth and vitality, and is an integral

part of homeland defense. Ports handle 95 percent of our overseas cargo by volume, 
enable  the  deployment  of  our  military,  and  serve  as  departure  points  for  millions 
of cruise passengers. 

Protecting our international seaport borders is a responsibility shared by the fed-
eral,  state,  and  local  governments,  seaports  and  private  industry.  The  Department 
of  Homeland  Security  takes  the  lead  in  protecting  America’s  ports.  This  includes 
programs of the U.S. Coast Guard, the Border and Transportation Security Admin-
istration,  Customs  and  Border  Protection  Service,  Immigration  and  Customs  En-
forcement, and plant and animal inspection. Ports, for their part, focus on protecting 
the  facilities  where  this  international  cargo  enters  and  exits  the  country.  The  secu-
rity blueprint for these facilities is the MTSA and its regulations. 

AAPA  commends  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  for  its  excellent  job  in  developing  regula-
tions  and  reviewing  all  facility  and  vessel  plans  within  a  very  short  timeline.  All 
port  facilities  were  required  to  have  operational  port  security  plans  by  the  end  of 
2004.  These  plans  established  a  baseline  to  protect  ports  from  terrorist  threats.  As 
we  learn  more  and  start  to  look  at  the  vulnerabilities  identified  by  the  area  mari-
time committees and DHS’s intelligence programs, we understand more what needs 
to be done and make improvements to plans. More sophisticated technology can also 
help  us  harden  these  facilities  and  enhance  communications  with  first  responders. 
Ports also hope technology will provide a mechanism to decrease the number of per-
sonnel  required  to  secure  our  ports,  and  enhance  productivity  in  the  movement  of 
cargo. 

Key  to  enhancing  physical  security  of  ports  is  the  Port  Security  Grant  Program. 
It was established after 9/11 through the Appropriations process and provides much-
needed help to port facilities to harden security to protect these vital ports of entry 
from  acts  of  terrorism.  The  program  has  been  authorized  in  several  bills—MTSA 
and  Coast  Guard  reauthorization—although  the  program,  as  implemented,  is  a  bit 
different from the current authorization bills. 

Since  its  inception,  the  program  has  provided  $565  million  in  grants  for  1,200 
projects,  with  Congress  providing  an  additional  $150  million  in  FY05.  Overall,  only 
one-sixth  of  all  projects  have  been  funded.  With  95  percent  of  our  overseas  trade 
flowing  through  our  ports,  all  states  and  all  citizens  would  be  impacted  by  a  shut-
down of our seaports. Agriculture as well as oil are two commodities that are heav-
ily  dependent  on  ports  to  ensure  these  products  get  to  market.  Imagine  the  impact 
of  a  shutdown  of  the  ports  in  South  Louisiana  that  handle  much  of  the  oil  imports 
and grain exports for this Nation. 

The level of funding and policy decisions from DHS have made this program less 
effective than it could be. The need is great, and in the last round, especially, DHS 
gave small amounts to numerous projects. Some ports had to wait to finish projects 
because  they  did  not  have  the  necessary  funds  to  fully  complete  the  project.  The 
Port of New Orleans, for example, got partial funding for four gates rather than full 
funding  for  one.  The  MTSA  states  that  the  funds  will  be  distributed  in  a  fair  and 
equitable way. However, DHS is also trying to balance risks and protect critical na-
tional  seaports  (as  noted  in  the  Appropriations  bill).  DHS  faced  a  dilemma—if  it 
funds  only  the  top  risks,  it  leaves  a  soft  underbelly  of  smaller  ports.  If  it  gives  a 
little  to  everyone,  little  gets  done.  The  problem  seems  to  be  one  of  historic  under-
funding.  We  must  have  funds  to  do  both—provide  the  needed  resources  for  big  and 
small ports alike. 

These complaints were also echoed by DHS’s Inspector General and others. In an 
attempt  to  make  the  grants  more  risk-based,  in  the  fifth  round  ODP  is  expected  to 
focus  more  on  high-risk  and  vulnerable  ports.  But  the  funding  level,  and  partial 
funding of projects, continues to be a huge constraint to progress. 

There  is  also  an  inconsistency  over  what  the  grants  pay  for.  The  MTSA  stated 
grants  can  pay  for  salaries,  operation  and  maintenance  of  security  equipment,  and 
the  cost  of  physical  improvements  and  vulnerability  assessments.  But  the  program 
allowed  only  reimbursement  of  the  last  two  items.  This  is  due  to  the  low  level  of 
funding.  The  Coast  Guard  estimated  the  cost  of  facility  compliance  with  the  MTSA 
regulations  would  be  $5.4  billion  over  10  years.  AAPA  supports  a  funding  level  of 
$400 million a year, which is significantly higher than the current budget. 

And  there  is  a  new  threat  to  this  vital  program.  In  the  proposed  FY06  budget, 
the Administration recommended eliminating the Port Security Grant Program and 
merging  ports  into  a  broad  targeted  infrastructure  protection  grant  program.  This 
runs  counter  to  the  intent  of  this  Committee.  Last  year,  this  Committee  included 
a  provision  in  the  Coast  Guard  Reauthorization  bill  to  update  the  authorization  of 
the  program.  The  Act  maintained  that  there  would  be  a  separate  program  specifi-
cally for port security to be based on the MTSA. 

The  new  Targeted  Infrastructure  Protection  Program  would  lump  port  security 
into  a  program  with  trains,  trucks,  buses  and  other  public  transit,  and  chemical

companies  and  ties  these  grants  to  the  goal  of  protecting  critical  infrastructure 
based on relative risk, vulnerability and needs. This move would pit an underfunded 
border  protection  program  (port  security)  against  underfunded  domestic  protection 
programs. AAPA has great concerns, and encourages your Committee to voice oppo-
sition to this new structure. 

Our economy, our safety and our national defense depend largely on how well we 
can protect our seaports. According to the 9/11 Commission Report, opportunities to 
do harm are as great, or greater, in maritime as they are at airports. Ports are also 
the  only  industry  within  this  new  Targeted  Infrastructure  Protection  Program  that 
has  a  statutory  mandate  to  comply  with—the  MTSA—and  the  only  one  for  which 
there is a congressionally authorized grant program, which was also created by this 
Committee.  A  separate  line  item  is  essential  to  ensure  that  ports  continue  to  be  a 
targeted  priority  in  our  country’s  war  again  terrorism.  Cargo  doesn’t  vote  and  it  is 
often  not  fully  recognized  for  the  value  it  provides  to  this  country  in  state  and  fed-
eral infrastructure plans. While critical infrastructure protection is important, using 
it as the sole criteria for making decisions on funding for port security is a bad idea. 
DHS  proposes  to  do  this  so  it  doesn’t  have  so  many  separate  grant  programs.  We 
don’t  oppose  merging  other  programs  together,  just  the  lumping  of  ports  into  this 
program.  Seaports,  like  airports,  are  key  targets  and  deserve  a  separate  program. 
We  must  focus  on  protection  at  all  seaports  since  ports  serve  as  an  international 
border, and an incident at one would surely impact all ports. The MTSA has a sys-
tem  established  to  identify  risks  and  vulnerabilities,  and  while  some  may  question 
some  of  the  DHS  decisions  on  certain  grants,  the  overall  move  to  tying  the  grants 
to the MTSA is one that AAPA supports. This was not done in the first few rounds 
because  the  MTSA  was  not  in  effect  yet.  We  urge  DHS  to  refocus  the  program  on 
the  MTSA,  while  including  a  cross-check  to  the  critical  infrastructure  plan  and  to 
keep this as a separate program, like the firefighter grants. 

We  also  urge  this  Committee  to  take  a  leadership  role  in  advocating  for  stronger 
funding  for  the  current  port  security  grant  program  in  the  FY06  appropriations 
process.  As  noted  above,  the  Coast  Guard  has  estimated  that  ports  would  have  to 
spend $5.4 billion over a 10-year period to comply with the new MTSA. AAPA urges 
a  funding  level  of  $400  million  in  FY06.  Recently,  the  House  Appropriations  Com-
mittee approved only $150 million, which is level funding. There is still much to be 
done to continue our progress in securing America’s ports. 

Ports are currently planning for a huge increase in trade in the future. Adequate 
federal funds will help us avoid an infrastructure crisis in the future. Industry ana-
lysts  predict  that  within  the  next  15  years  the  approximately  two  billion  tons  of 
cargo that U.S. ports handle today will double. But ports are also challenged by the 
new  security  mandates  of  the  MTSA  and  the  need  to  continue  to  make  improve-
ments.  Therefore,  ports  are  using  current  dollars  to  pay  for  security,  rather  than 
capital  investments  needed  to  handle  the  future  growth  in  international  trade.  We 
need  the  federal  government  to  provide  its  share  of  these  improvements  now,  so 
that our ports are secure today and will be able to meet the challenges and opportu-
nities of accommodating the world trade needs of tomorrow. 

Finally, AAPA would like to voice its strong support for the Transportation Work-
er Identification Credentialing (TWIC) program, which was authorized in the MTSA. 
We  urge  increased  funding  for  this  program  and  encourage  DHS  to  make  the  nec-
essary  policy  decisions  to  implement  this  program  quickly.  The  MTSA  required  all 
ports to control access to their facilities, but our U.S. member ports are still waiting 
for the TWIC requirements before installing new technologies. 

Thank  you  for  inviting  us  to  testify  on  this  critical  transportation  security  issue. 
Ports  stand  ready  to  do  their  part  in  protecting  America.  We  urge  your  Committee 
to  voice  your  support  for  a  strong  appropriation  in  FY06  for  a  separate  line  item 
for the Port Security Grant Program. 

Thank you. I would be happy to answer any questions.

The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Koch? 

STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER L. KOCH, PRESIDENT/CEO, 

WORLD SHIPPING COUNCIL 

Mr. KOCH. Mr. Chairman, Senator Inouye, thank you for the op-

portunity to be here. 

As we look at the question of maritime security, we find it help-
ful to break it out into its different components. There’s ship secu-

rity.  There’s  port-facility  security.  There’s  people—personnel  secu-
rity. And there’s cargo security. 

61

The  Coast  Guard’s  really  done  a  very  good  job  in  dealing  with 
the  ships,  and  with  the  port  facilities.  On  the  people  piece,  there’s 
been certain restrictions applied. All seafarers coming into the U.S. 
now have to have their own individual visas. 

Mr.  Chairman,  you  started  this  hearing  by  asking,  ‘‘Well,  what 
is  it  we  should  do,  going  forward,  that  we’re  not  doing  today,’’  and 
I’d like to offer a couple of suggestions. 

First  is  the  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Card  (TWIC). 
It’s been legislated as a requirement for the maritime sector. Coast 
Guard  and  TSA  are  working  on  that  right  now.  We  understand 
from  the  Coast  Guard  that  they  expect  to  have  a  rulemaking  out 
in  July  of  this  year.  And  this  is  a  necessary  element  to  move  for-
ward. 

The  last  piece  of  the  puzzle  really  is  cargo,  cargo  security,  and 
it’s a multifaceted strategy the government has, as you heard from 
Mr.  Jacksta.  But  the  starting  strategy  here  is  risk  assessment. 
Customs  today  screens  100  percent  of  all  containers  before  they’re 
loaded in a foreign port, before they’re put on a ship to be brought 
to the U.S. That is the strategy we’ve used, 100 percent screening. 
They  then  inspect  100  percent  of  all  boxes  they  have  questions 
about.  As  you  heard,  that’s  slightly  over  5  percent.  So,  if  the  core 
strategy  we’re  using  is  risk  assessment,  we  have  to  look  at  what 
data is being used to make those risk judgments. 

Today what we’re using is what’s been mandated under the ‘‘24-
hour  rule,’’  the  ocean  carriers’  bill-of-lading  information,  our  mani-
fest.  It  was  a  good  start.  Commissioner  Bonner  was  right  to  do 
that. We support that strategy 100 percent. Our observation would 
be that the ocean carriers’ bill of lading is a limited source of infor-
mation for undertaking effective risk assessment. 

Today  the  foreign  exporter  or  the  U.S.  importer  is  not  required 
to  give  the  government  any  information  about  the  goods  they  are 
bringing into the U.S. until after the goods are here. It’s our belief 
that what really ought to be done is, for risk-assessment purposes, 
the importer should provide its data to Customs before vessel load-
ing, just like the ocean carrier does, so that the National Targeting 
Center  in  Northern  Virginia  that  screens  all  these  shipments  has 
the  benefit  of  better,  more  robust,  and  more  accurate  information 
on those shipments. 

Also,  as  you  heard  today,  the  strategy  is  to  inspect  100  percent 
of  all  containers  coming  in,  with  radiation-inspection  equipment. 
The  goal  for  Customs  is  to  have  that  done  by  the  end  of  this  year, 
and they’re making very good progress on getting that done. There 
are  some  problems  in  some  ports  with  on-dock  rail,  as  you  would 
have  seen  in  L.A.,  but,  overall,  they’re  making  very  good  progress 
on that. 

Finally, there’s the in-transit security piece of the issue. The big-
gest security vulnerability for containers is when they’re stuffed at 
the foreign origin, but we also have to recognize that we need some 
measure  in  place  to  verify  whether  containers  coming  through  the 
system have been tampered with in transit. We have proposed that 
the  government  establish  a  rulemaking  to  require  seal  verification 
on inbound containers, and DHS and Customs are working on that.

62

We  expect  that  to  be  out  as  a  rulemaking  sometime  during  the 
course  of  this  summer.  It’ll  be  complicated.  It’ll  be  very  expensive. 
But we think it’s an appropriate measure, moving forward. 

When that’s in place, it’ll also stimulate and advance technology. 
We’re  spending  a  lot  of  time  looking  at  technology  issues  for  con-
tainers. It’s quite complicated. But we do believe that when there’s 
a  seal  verification  requirement,  it  will,  in  fact,  accelerate  tech-
nology  development,  particularly  RFID  technology,  that  would  or 
could make some significant improvements, going forward. 

So,  in  terms  of  answering  your  question,  Mr.  Chairman,  the 
three  things  that  we  would  offer  for  your  consideration  that  ought 
to be done: first, get better data for risk assessment for the screen-
ing  process  of  the  cargo  coming  in;  second,  support  DHS  as  it 
moves forward with the TWIC initiative; and, third, recognize that 
a  seal-verification  rule  will  be  in  place  in  the  near  future,  which 
is also going to be a big step forward. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER L. KOCH, PRESIDENT/CEO, WORLD SHIPPING 

COUNCIL 

Introduction 

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to 
testify  before  you  today.  My  name  is  Christopher  Koch.  I  am  President  and  CEO 
of  the  World  Shipping  Council,  a  non-profit  trade  association  of  over  40  inter-
national  ocean  carriers,  established  to  address  public  policy  issues  of  interest  and 
importance  to  the  international  liner  shipping  industry.  The  Council’s  members  in-
clude  the  full  spectrum  of  ocean  common  carriers,  from  large  global  operators  to 
trade-specific niche carriers, offering container, roll-on roll-off, car carrier and other 
international  transportation  services.  They  carry  roughly  93  percent  of  the  United 
States’ imports and exports transported by the international liner shipping industry, 
or more than $500 billion worth of American foreign commerce per year. 1 

I  also  serve  as  Chairman  of  the  Department  of  Homelands  Security’s  National 
Maritime Security Advisory Committee, as a member of the Departmental Advisory 
Committee  on  Commercial  Operations  of  Customs  and  Border  Protection  (COAC), 
and on the Department of Transportation’s Marine Transportation System National 
Advisory Committee. It is a pleasure to be here today. 

In  2004,  American  businesses  imported  10  million  loaded  cargo  containers  into 
the United States. The liner shipping industry transports on average about $1.5 bil-
lion  worth  of  containerized  goods  through  U.S.  ports  each  day.  In  2005,  a  projected 
11  percent  growth  rate  means  that  the  industry  will  handle  more  than  11  million 
U.S. import container loads. In 2006, containerized trade growth is forecasted to in-
crease another 10 percent, and we will need to be ready to handle more than twelve 
million  import  containers.  And  these  trade  growth  trends  are  not  expected  to  stop 
after 2006. 

Consider the requirements of one customer of our industry. Wal-Mart will import 
roughly 360,000 FEUs (forty foot containers) this year. If you were to place that vol-
ume on trucks bumper-to-bumper in a single line, it would stretch 3,750 miles. And 
those  volumes  have  to  be  moved  efficiently  at  the  same  time  as  L.L.  Bean’s,  Tar-
get’s,  Home  Depot’s,  Ford’s,  K  Mart’s,  Procter  &  Gamble’s,  McDonald’s,  Hewlett 
Packard’s, General Motors’, General Electric’s, Whirlpool’s, Nike’s, Becks Beer, Joe’s 
Hardware Store, and thousands of other shippers. 

The  demands  on  all  parties  in  the  transportation  sector  to  handle  these  large 
cargo volumes efficiently is both a major challenge and very important to the Amer-
ican economy. 

At the same time that the industry is addressing the issues involved in efficiently 
moving  over  11  million  U.S.  import  containers  this  year,  we  also  must  continue  to 
address the unfinished task of enhancing maritime security, and do so in a way that 
doesn’t unreasonably hamper commerce.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has stated that there are no known 
credible  threats  that  indicate  terrorists  are  planning  to  infiltrate  or  attack  the 
United States via maritime shipping containers. At the same time, America’s supply 
chains extend to tens of thousands of different points around the world, and the po-
tential  vulnerability  of  containerized  transportation  requires  the  development  and 
implementation  of  prudent  security  measures.  Like  many  parts  of  our  society,  we 
thus confront an unknown threat, but a known vulnerability. 

What is the appropriate collection of measures to address this challenge? 
The  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s  maritime  security  efforts  involve  many 
different,  but  complementary  pieces,  including  implementing  the  directives  of  the 
Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA). 

It includes the establishment of vessel security plans for all arriving vessels pursu-
ant  to  the  International  Ship  &  Port  Facility  Security  Code  (ISPS  Code)  and  Mari-
time Transportation Security Act (MTSA). 

It includes the establishment of U.S. port facility security plans and area maritime 
security plans pursuant to the ISPS Code and MTSA, and the establishment by the 
Coast  Guard  of  the  International  Port  Security  Program  (IPSP)  pursuant  to  which 
the Coast Guard visits foreign ports and terminals to share and align security prac-
tices and assess compliance with the ISPS Code. 

The Coast Guard’s efforts to implement these initiatives are well developed. 
It includes the Maritime Domain Awareness program, under which DHS acquires 
enhanced  information  about  vessel  movements  and  deploys  various  technologies  for 
better  maritime  surveillance.  The  challenge  of  effectively  patrolling  all  the  coasts 
and waters of the United States is obviously a large one. 

The  MTSA  directives  and  DHS  efforts  also  include  enhanced  security  for  per-
sonnel  working  in  the  maritime  area,  from  the  requirement  that  all  foreign  sea-
farers have individual visas if they are to get off a ship in the U.S., to the imminent 
promulgation of proposed rules on the Transportation Worker Identification Creden-
tial (TWIC). Regarding the TWIC, DHS officials have indicated their intent to issue 
a  proposed  rulemaking  on  this  issue  this  summer.  At  the  request  of  DHS,  the  Na-
tional Maritime Security Advisory Committee, after intensive, open and constructive 
dialogue  amongst  diverse  industry  and  government  officials,  approved  last  Friday 
a  detailed  set  of  recommendations  to  the  Department  for  their  consideration  in  the 
development of this ambitious initiative. 

And  last,  but  certainly  not  least,  MTSA  directives  and  DHS  efforts  include  an 
array  of  initiatives  to  enhance  cargo  security,  which  the  Committee  staff  has  re-
quested that I discuss. There are several elements and programs that comprise the 
government’s  cargo  security  strategy,  and  each  has  a  role.  This  morning  I’d  like  to 
briefly address the following cargo security issues:

• Cargo Security Risk Assessment Screening 
• Radiation Inspection of all Containers 
• Enhancing In-Transit Container Security 
• The Container Security Initiative 
• The C–TPAT Program 
• The World Customs Organization 
• Container Security Technology

1. Cargo Security Risk Assessment and the National Targeting Center 

The  stated  and  statutorily  mandated  strategy  of  the  U.S.  Government  is  to  con-
duct  a  security  screening  of  containerized  cargo  shipments  before  they  are  loaded 
on a U.S. bound vessel in a foreign port. The World Shipping Council fully supports 
this  strategy.  The  correct  time  and  place  for  the  cargo  security  screening  is  before 
the containers are loaded on a ship. Most cargo interests also appreciate the impor-
tance  of  this  strategy,  because  they  don’t  want  their  shipments  aboard  a  vessel  de-
layed  because  of  a  security  concern  that  could  arise  regarding  another  cargo  ship-
ment aboard the ship. 

In order to be able to perform this advance security screening, Customs and Bor-
der  Protection  (Customs  or  CBP)  implemented  the  ‘‘24  Hour  Rule’’  in  early  2003, 
under which ocean carriers are required to provide Customs with their cargo mani-

fore  those  containers  are  loaded  onto  the  vessel  in  a  foreign  port.  The  Council  sup-

then  screens  every  shipment  using  its  Automated  Targeting  System  (ATS),  which 
also uses various sources of intelligence information, to determine which containers 
should  not  be  loaded  aboard  the  vessel  at  the  foreign  port,  which  containers  need 
to be inspected at either the foreign port or the U.S. discharge port, and which con-
tainers are considered low-risk and able to be transported expeditiously and without

further review. Every container shipment loaded on a vessel for the U.S. is screened 
through this system before vessel loading at the foreign load port. 

The Department of Homeland Security’s strategy is thus based on its performance 
of  a  security  screening  of  relevant  cargo  shipment  data  for  100  percent  of  all  con-
tainerized cargo shipments before vessel loading, and subsequent inspections of 100 
percent  of  those  containers  that  raise  security  issues  after  initial  screening.  Today, 
we  understand  that  CBP  inspects  roughly  5.5–6  percent  of  all  inbound  containers 
(over 500,000 containers/year), using either X-ray or gamma ray technology (or both) 
or by physical devanning of the container. 

We all have a strong interest in the government performing as effective a security 
screening  as  possible  before  vessel  loading.  Experience  also  shows  that  substantial 
disruptions  to  commerce  can  be  avoided  if  security  questions  relating  to  a  cargo 
shipment  have  been  addressed  prior  to  a  vessel  being  loaded  and  sailing.  Not  only 
is credible advance cargo security screening necessary to the effort to try to prevent 
a  cargo  security  incident,  but  it  is  necessary  for  any  reasonable  contingency  plan-
ning or incident recovery strategy. 

Today,  while  the  ATS  uses  various  sources  of  data,  the  only  data  that  the  com-
mercial  sector  is  required  to  provide  to  Customs  for  each  shipment  for  the  before-
vessel-loading  security  screening  is  the  ocean  carrier’s  bill  of  lading/manifest  data 
filed under the 24 Hour Rule. This was a good start, but carriers’ manifest data has 
limitations. 

Cargo  manifest  data  should  be  supplemented  in  order  to  provide  better  security 
risk assessment capabilities. 2 Currently, there is no data that is required to be filed 
into  ATS  by  the  U.S.  importer  or  the  foreign  exporter  that  can  be  used  in  the  pre-
vessel  loading  security  screening  process,  even  though  these  parties  possess  ship-
ment data that CBP officials believe would have security risk assessment relevance 
that  is  not  available  in  the  carriers’  manifest  filings,  and  notwithstanding  the  fact 
that the law requires the cargo security screening and evaluation system to be con-
ducted  ‘‘prior  to  loading  in  a  foreign  port.’’ 3 Today,  cargo  entry  data  is  required  to 
be  filed  with  CBP  by  the  importer,  but  is  not  required  to  be  filed  until  after  the 
cargo  shipment  is  in  the  United  States,  often  at  its  inland  destination—too  late  to 
be used for security screening purposes. 

Last  fall,  the  COAC  Maritime  Transportation  Security  Act  Advisory  Sub-
committee submitted to DHS a recommendation that importers should provide Cus-
toms with the following data before vessel loading:

1. Better cargo description (carriers’ manifest data is not always specific or pre-
cise) 
2. Party that is selling the goods to the importer 
3. Party that is purchasing the goods 
4. Point of origin of the goods 
5. Country from which the goods are exported 
6. Ultimate consignee 
7. Exporter representative 
8. Name of broker (would seem relevant for security check) 
9.  Origin  of  container  shipment—the  name  and  address  of  the  business  where 
the container was stuffed

The  Council  agrees  with  this  recommendation.  The  government’s  strategy  today 
is to inspect containerized cargo on a risk-assessment basis. Accordingly, the govern-
ment  should  improve  the  cargo  shipment  data  it  currently  uses  for  its  risk  assess-
ment.  An  ocean  carrier’s  bill  of  lading  by  itself  is  not  sufficient  for  cargo  security 
screening.  These  cargo  entry  shipment  data  elements  would  improve  cargo  security 
screening capabilities. If a risk assessment strategy is to remain the core of the gov-
ernment’s  cargo  security  system,  the  government  needs  to  decide  what  additional 
advance cargo shipment information it needs to do the job well, and it must require 
cargo interests, and not just carriers, to provide the relevant data in time to do the 
advance security screening. While this is not a simple task, a next step forward re-
quiring shipper interests to provide more data on their cargo shipments before ves-
sel loading is appropriate. CBP and DHS officials are currently reviewing this issue.

2. Radiation Screening 

A particular security concern is the potential use of a container to transport a nu-
clear  or  radiological  device.  While  there  is  no  evidence  that  terrorists  have  nuclear 
weapons or devices, or that a shipping container would be a likely means to deliver 
such a device, the consequences of the potential threat—including those from a low 
tech ‘‘dirty bomb’’—are sufficiently great that, in addition to the targeted inspection 
of containers discussed above, CBP is deploying radiation scanning equipment at all 
major U.S container ports, with the objective of being able to check every container 
entering  the  U.S.  for  radiation  by  the  end  of  this  year.  CBP  and  the  Department 
of  Energy  are  also  working  with  foreign  ports  to  encourage  the  installation  of  radi-
ation scanning technology abroad as well. 

We  understand  that  the  Government  Accountability  Office  is  currently  reviewing 
the  effectiveness  of  the  radiation  detection  equipment  being  used,  which  is  clearly 
an important issue. 
3. Enhancing In-Transit Container Security 

While  the  most  important  and  challenging  container  security  issue  is  ensuring 
that containers are loaded with cargo securely in the first place, it is also important 
to have a system that can help determine whether a container may have been tam-
pered  with  while  in-transit.  In  September  2003,  the  Council,  together  with  the  Na-
tional  Industrial  Transportation  League  and  the  Retail  Industry  Leaders  Associa-
tion,  recommended  to  DHS  that  the  government  promulgate  a  container  seal 
verification  rule  as  the  most  practical  way  to  address  this  issue  in  the  near  term. 
The  Maritime  Transportation  Security  Act  Advisory  Subcommittee  of  COAC  made 
the same recommendation to DHS last fall. CBP and DHS are currently in the proc-
ess  of  drafting  proposed  regulations  on  this  issue.  This  will  be  a  costly  and  chal-
lenging  rule  to  implement,  but  we  recognize  the  need  to  address  this  issue  and  the 
need for a container seal verification rulemaking. 

Some  of  the  more  important  issues  that  will  need  to  be  addressed  in  this  rule-
making will be: the reporting process to CBP when a seal anomaly is identified, the 
consequences  to  the  shipment  when  a  seal  anomaly  is  identified,  where  the  seal 
verification  is  to  take  place,  and  a  reasonable  implementation  time  frame  that  will 
allow port facilities around the world to develop implementation measures. 
4. Container Security Initiative 

No nation by itself can protect international trade. International cooperation is es-
sential.  For  ships  and  port  facilities,  the  International  Maritime  Organization 
(IMO),  a  U.N.  regulatory  agency  with  international  requirement  setting  authority, 
has responded to U.S. leadership and created the International Ship and Port Secu-
rity Code (ISPS). These IMO rules are internationally applicable and are strictly en-
forced by the U.S. Coast Guard. There is no comparable international regulatory in-
stitution  with  rule  writing  authority  for  international  supply  chain  security.  For  a 
variety  of  reasons,  the  World  Customs  Organization  (WCO)  has  not  acquired  such 
an authority. 

At the WCO, CBP is working diligently with other governments on a supply chain 
security framework that can be used by all trading nations. This framework will be 
useful, but will remain at a fairly high level and will be implemented on a voluntary 
basis  by  interested  governments.  Consequently,  U.S.  and  foreign  customs  authori-
ties must also create a network of bilateral cooperative relationships to share infor-
mation and to enhance trade security. This is the Container Security Initiative. The 
Council supports this program and the strategy behind it. 

In March, Dubai became an operational CSI port, and Shanghai and Yantian are 
expected  to  become  operational  soon.  When  they  are,  more  than  60  percent  of  U.S. 
containerized  imports  will  be  passing  through  operational  CSI  ports,  with  further 
program  growth  expected.  The  liner  shipping  industry  is  fully  supportive  of  these 
efforts  by  Customs  authorities  and  hopes  the  program  will  continue  to  expand  as 
expeditiously  as  possible. 4 A  listing  of  operational,  and  soon  to  be  operational,  CSI 
ports follows: 

4 On  May  9,  the  Argentine  government  signed  a  declaration  of  principles  to  become  involved 
in  CSI.  The  expansion  of  CSI  to  Buenos  Aires  will  be  the  first  CSI  cooperative  agreement  in 
Latin America.

One  of  the  issues  that  the  recent  Government  Accountability  Office  (GAO)  report 
on CSI identified was that foreign Customs authorities are not inspecting at the for-
eign  load  port  all  of  the  containers  that  CBP  has  identified  for  security  inspection. 
There are a number of relevant issues with respect to this finding, but I would note 
a couple of points. 

First, understanding why these containers were not inspected at the foreign ports 
is very important. For example if it was because local Customs intelligence had good 
reasons  to  determine  there  was  not  a  significant  security  risk,  that  fact  would  be 
obviously relevant. 

Second,  building  cooperative  Customs  relationships  requires  time,  commitment 
and mutual trust. In order for the CBP officials stationed in CSI ports to build trust 
and  relationships  with  foreign  customs  authorities,  the  CBP  program  must  be  sup-
ported  with  professional  personnel  that  have  long-term  assignments  to  these  posi-
tions.  Foreign  customs  authorities  would  have  a  difficult  time  building  cooperative 
relationships  if  the  CBP  personnel  must  rotate  out  of  their  CSI  positions  after  a 
short period of time. We understand that this has been an issue in the early phases 
of  the  CSI  program,  and  hope  that  any  difficulties  CBP  may  have  had  in  getting 
qualified, full time people stationed to these positions is being or has been resolved. 
CBP  will  need  the  full  support  of  DHS  and  the  Department  of  State  to  ensure  an 
effective and robust CSI program. 

Third,  we  note  that  the  supply-chain-security  framework  that  is  being  developed 
by  the  World  Customs  Organization  (WCO)  and  is  expected  to  be  approved  next 
month,  provides  an  important  reinforcing  principle  that  should  help  the  CSI  pro-
gram, namely that the Customs administrations of exporting nations should conduct

outbound security inspection of high-risk containers at the reasonable request of the 
importing  country.  This  is  an  international  affirmation  of  the  CSI  program’s  prin-
ciples. 

Finally,  if  CBP  ever  encounters  a  foreign  customs  authority  that  is  unwilling  to 
inspect a container that CBP believes is high risk, it can and should issue the ocean 
carrier a ‘‘Do Not Load’’ message and that container will not be loaded aboard a ves-
sel destined for the U.S. There is no reason why any container that CBP has identi-
fied  as  ‘‘high  risk’’  can’t  and  shouldn’t  be  stopped  and  inspected  before  it  is  loaded 
aboard  a  vessel  bound  for  the  U.S.  If  the  container  is  not  high  risk  but  still  one 
that  CBP  wishes  to  inspect,  it  can  use  its  discretion  to  inspect  it  at  the  U.S.  dis-
charge port. 
5. C–TPAT 

C–TPAT  is  an  initiative  intended  to  increase  supply-chain-security  through  vol-
untary,  non-regulatory  agreements  with  various  industry  sectors.  Its  primary  focus 
is  on  the  participation  of  U.S.  importers,  who  are  in  turn  urged  to  have  their  sup-
pliers implement security measures all the way down their supply chains to the ori-
gin  of  the  goods.  This  approach  has  an  obvious  attraction  in  the  fact  that  the  im-
porter’s suppliers in foreign countries are beyond the reach of U.S. regulatory juris-
diction.  In  return  for  participating  in  the  program,  importers  are  given  a  benefit  of 
reduced  cargo  inspection.  The  C–TPAT  program  invites  participation  from  other 
parties  involved  in  the  supply  chain  as  well,  including  carriers,  customs  brokers, 
freight forwarders, U.S. port facilities, and a limited application to foreign manufac-
turers. 

C–TPAT has improved the security of importers’ supply chains. How much it has 
improved security is difficult to determine or measure. GAO has produced a critical 
study  of  C–TPAT,  entitled  ‘‘Partnership  Program  Grants  Importers  Reduced  Scru-
tiny with Limited Assurance of Improved Security.’’ The program is currently under 
scrutiny  by  both  Congress  and  DHS.  It  is  facing  both  fair  and  unrealistic  criticism. 
C–TPAT  needs  to  be  understood  for  what  it  is  and  what  it  is  not.  C–TPAT  is  a 
set of voluntary partnerships between CBP and willing industry members. C–TPAT 
is  not  a  regulatory  program.  It  should  not  be  confused  as  being  one.  Nor  should  it 
be  a  substitute  for  regulations  when  the  government  has  clear,  specific  things  it 
wants  industry  to  do  to  enhance  security.  The  difficulty  is  that  the  program  is  in 
some respects ambiguous, and perhaps unavoidably so. 

It is not a regulatory program, yet critics want specificity, strict enforcement, and 

Its  principal  purpose  is  to  try  to  affect  the  conduct  of  parties  outside  U.S.  regu-
latory jurisdiction, yet some expect it to have an effect similar to what would occur 
if these parties were subject to U.S. regulatory jurisdiction. 

It  is  a  program  that  relies  on  participants’  own  risk  assessment  and  allows  par-
ticipant’s  discretion  and  flexibility  in  application  of  the  security  standards.  At  the 
same time, the program tries to promote uniform and common standards of behavior 
through generalized ‘‘minimum standards.’’

When  COAC  posed  questions  that,  in  essence,  asked  what  importers  should  do 
when  some  of  their  suppliers  are  compliant  with  C–TPAT  standards  and  some  are 
not,  CBP  responded  in  their  Frequently  Asked  Questions  that  all  of  an  importer’s 
suppliers  should  be  compliant  or  that  the  importer  must  demonstrate  an  ongoing 
commitment to get all suppliers compliant. Importers will face situations where they 
cannot  require  or  ensure  that  all  their  suppliers  are  compliant.  On  the  one  hand, 
one can sympathize with the way the issue is being addressed, because CBP wants 
to  keep  pushing  for  full  compliance,  and  because  the  program  would  become  much 
more complicated if each importer’s supply chain had to become divided into various 
levels  of  compliance  or  non-compliance.  On  the  other  hand,  by  not  differentiating 
within importers’ supply chains, one must either accept or not accept the proposition 
that each container shipment of a C–TPAT importer is likely to obtain an equivalent 
lowering of its risk assessment. 

C–TPAT  is  a  program  that  other  nations’  customs  authorities  and  the  WCO  are 
examining and find conceptually attractive, yet its definition, its application and the 
extent  of  its  utility  are  still  in  development  and  not  yet  settled  here  in  the  U.S.  A 
common,  global  C–TPAT,  ‘‘trusted  shipper’’  type  system  might  be  a  very  good  idea. 
At  the  same  time,  if  many  trading  nations  were  to  implement  C–TPAT  type  pro-
grams in ways that significantly differ from each other, very significant complexities 
for international commerce could emerge, including the possibility of redundant and 
duplicative, or even inconsistent, efforts. 

penalties for non-compliance—features that characterize regulatory programs. 

Its  costs  can  be  significant,  but  its  benefits  are  necessarily  limited;  parties  that 

are not importers receive no direct benefit from the program.

68

These  are  difficult  issues,  and  one  should  temper  criticism  of  the  program  with 
an  appreciation  for  the  fact  that  CBP  has  been  trying  very  hard  to  make  the  pro-
gram effectively address significant concerns in supply-chain-security in areas where 
it has no regulatory jurisdiction. The program is a voluntary, non-regulatory, evolv-
ing initiative. 

Voluntary Partnerships: C–TPAT tries to provide general guidance for enhanc-
ing  security  with  respect  to  some,  but  not  all,  aspects  of  supply-chain-security.  It 
recognizes  that  flexibility  in  application  is  unavoidable  when  applied  to  the  tens  of 
thousands  of  different  supply  chains  around  the  globe.  For  example,  the  new  C–
TPAT  Importer  Security  Criteria  have  standards  for  fencing,  facility  lighting,  and 
employee background checks and credential checking. C–TPAT importers can agree 
to communicate this to all their foreign suppliers and to urge their suppliers’ compli-
ance,  but  obviously  not  every  business  in  the  world  involved  in  shipping  goods  to 
a  U.S.  C–TPAT  importer  is  going  to  have  compliant  fencing,  lighting,  etc.  This 
doesn’t  mean  C–TPAT  is  a  failure,  or  that  a  C–TPAT  importer  is  a  failure  if  one 
or more of its suppliers don’t conform to the standard, and it doesn’t mean that C–
TPAT doesn’t provide security enhancement. It means that there is an unavoidable 
degree  of  variability,  imprecision  and  ambiguity  in  the  program  when  it  comes  to 
its implementation. 

Not  a  Regulatory  Program:  Many  maritime  and  supply-chains-security  issues 
can be, should be, and are addressed through regulatory requirements, not C–TPAT. 
For  example,  vessel  security  plans  and  port  security  plans  are  regulated  by  Coast 
Guard regulations implementing the ISPS Code and MTSA. The data that must be 
filed with CBP to facilitate cargo security screening must be addressed through uni-
formly  applied  regulations.  Seafarer  credentials  and  the  Transportation  Worker 
Identification Card must be addressed through uniformly applied requirements. Re-
quirements to verify seals on import containers need to be addressed through regu-
lations. 

C–TPAT  is  a  program  that  can  try  to  address  matters  that  are  not  or  cannot  be 
addressed  by  regulations,  such  as  supply  chain  enhancements  beyond  U.S.  regu-
latory  jurisdiction,  or  matters  that  aren’t  covered  by  regulations,  such  as  cooper-
ating with CBP in providing access to information in support of investigative inquir-
ies. C–TPAT may also be a platform from which CBP and program participants can 
analyze  security  vulnerabilities  and  problems  and  jointly  develop  plans  that  could 
more  effectively  try  to  address  such  situations.  C–TPAT,  however,  should  not  be 
used in lieu of regulations when regulations are the more appropriate method to en-
hance security. 

Validation:  CBP  has  a  C–TPAT  validation  program  to  confirm  that  participants 
are doing what they have said they would do, during which identified shortcomings 
can  and  should  be  discussed  and  remedial  measures  developed.  However,  the  GAO 
report  has  criticized  the  program  for  conferring  benefits  to  importers  before  valida-
tion  has  occurred  and  noted  that  the  agency  does  not  have  adequate  trained  per-
sonnel to validate all C–TPAT participants in a timely manner. 

This criticism is certainly welcomed by the private commercial security consulting 
business,  which  sees  a  substantial  business  opportunity  if  they  can  become  govern-
ment  sanctioned  security  validators  for  C–TPAT  type  programs  in  the  U.S.  and 
around  the  world.  Whether  C–TPAT  participants  or  the  government  would  accept 
this role, how such a role would be defined and overseen, what the standards would 
be,  whether  validation  by  commercial  parties  would  be  required  or  voluntary—are 
all issues that are undetermined at this time. 

Compliance: C–TPAT is not a regulatory regime, with specific criteria that must 
be  applied  to  everyone  at  all  times.  Some  of  the  program  criteria  are  very  general, 
and  its  criteria  do  not  cover  all  aspects  of  security.  Further,  a  security  failure  in 
a  specific  case  may  not  involve  a  lack  of  due  care  and  may  not  involve  a  breach  of 
the terms of the participant’s C–TPAT Agreement. 

Nevertheless, CBP has recently taken the position that it can suspend a C–TPAT 

participant from the program—

a.  Without  advance  notice,  without  discussion,  and  without  an  opportunity  to 
cure the problem.
b.  For  matters  that  are  not  covered  by  the  terms  of  the  C–TPAT  Agreement 
signed  by  CBP  and  the  carrier  (i.e.,  you  can  be  kicked  out  of  the  C–TPAT  pro-
gram even if you have complied with the C–TPAT Agreement’s terms).
c.  For  any  violation  of  law  or  significant  security  breach  (e.g.,  drugs  in  a  con-
tainer, stowaways in a container).
d. For an undefined duration.

program  but  have  written  their  C–TPAT  participation  into  many  of  their  transpor-
tation contracts with shippers, have found this to be a surprising and troubling de-
velopment  at  best.  Carriers  had  believed  that  under  a  ‘‘voluntary  partnership’’  pro-
gram  with  CBP,  specific  security  concerns  would  be  jointly  assessed  to  determine 
what  measures  could  reasonably  be  taken  to  address  any  specific  security  short-
comings.  To  face  no-notice  suspension  from  a  voluntary  program  that  provides  no 
direct  benefits  for  events  that  may  be  highly  unpredictable  and  under  the  control 
of third parties will significantly change the program and how it is perceived. 

Evolving Initiative: C–TPAT is an evolving initiative, and industry and govern-
ment will learn and adapt as it matures. For example, when the Sea Carrier portion 
of C–TPAT was formulated, there was no ISPS Code or Coast Guard MTSA regula-
tion regarding vessel and port facility security plans, so C–TPAT carriers recognized 
the regulatory void and agreed to undertake a number of voluntary measures in this 
regard.  Today,  there  are  comprehensive  Coast  Guard  regulations  on  these  issues, 
and  it  is  no  longer  appropriate  for  CBP  to  use  C–TPAT  to  address  the  issues  that 
the Coast Guard is addressing through its regulations. Similarly, carriers agreed in 
C–TPAT  to  participate  in  the  electronic  Automated  Manifest  System  (AMS)  for 
transmitting  manifest  information  to  CBP;  at  the  time,  paper  manifest  filings  were 
possible. Now, electronic filing in AMS is required by regulation. 

The future role of ocean carriers in C–TPAT will require further consideration and 
analysis.  Carriers,  unlike  importer’s  foreign  suppliers,  are  regulated  parties,  and 
CBP  and  the  Coast  Guard  can  and  have  established  clear,  uniformly  applicable 
rules  for  them  to  follow.  Furthermore,  C–TPAT  program  benefits,  which  are  basi-
cally  less  frequent  cargo  inspections,  are  importer  benefits.  Ocean  carriers  do  not 
receive  direct  benefits  from  CBP  for  C–TPAT  participation.  How  and  where  ocean 
carriers may fit in the program going forward remains to be seen. 

As regulated entities, ocean carriers have a preference for clear, uniformly applied 
security  regulations  when  an  issue  can  be  addressed  through  regulations.  At  the 
same time, we wish to continue to work with CBP and other DHS agencies to deter-
mine  if  there  are  appropriate  ways  to  supplement  the  regulatory  security  regime. 
This  will  continue  to  require  a  partnership  approach,  clear  communications,  and 
mutual benefits. 

Looking  Ahead:  C–TPAT  is  not  the  supply-chain-security  strategy  for  the  gov-
ernment—it  is  one  layer  and  one  piece  of  the  evolving  strategy.  At  the  same  time, 
the  program’s  critics  have  points  that  won’t  be  ignored.  For  example,  it  is  difficult 
to  believe  that  C–TPAT  is  presently  sufficiently  developed  to  actually  be  used  as  a 
determining  criteria  for  what  cargo  would  be  allowed  to  be  transported  if  the  gov-
ernment had to respond to a terrorist incident involving a containerized cargo ship-
ment, because, among other things, there is uncertainty about whether all the sup-
pliers  in  an  importer’s  supply  chain  comply  with  adequate  standards  that  warrant 
such confidence. 

However,  it  is  conceivable  that  the  program  may  be  able  to  attain  this  kind  of 
result if the foreign suppliers that actually stuff the containers were included in the 
program. The fact that foreign manufacturers (except some Mexican manufacturers) 
and the parties stuffing the containers are not in the program means that the most 
important parties in container security aren’t C–TPAT program participants. Could 
this be addressed by adding foreign manufacturers to the program? 

Perhaps so, if C–TPAT were to be able to evolve from a program that gives bene-
fits  to  U.S.  importers  if  they  undertake  certain  actions,  to  a  program  that  would 
give those benefits to shipments where both the U.S. importer and a foreign manu-
facturer or container stuffer were certified as compliant with the appropriate stand-
ards.  Is  there  a  way  for  a  program  that  is  constrained  by  resources  to  achieve  this 
additional extension? Perhaps yes. 

CBP,  under  Commissioner  Bonner’s  leadership,  has  been  diligently  developing 
international  supply  chain  security  standards  at  the  World  Customs  Organization, 
and  has  undertaken  discussions  with  the  European  Commission  and  various  na-
tional  governments.  There  is  a  possibility  to  develop  these  efforts  into  a  more  ad-
vanced, agreed internationalization of supply-chain-security improvements 
6. The World Customs Organization 

In  some  respects,  the  issues  surrounding  the  C–TPAT  program  are  similar  to 
those  that  the  World  Customs  Organization  (WCO)  has  been  grappling  with  since 
it established a special Task Force on Security and Trade Facilitation in 2002. 

Currently, the WCO is finalizing a Framework of Standards to Secure and Facili-
tate Global Trade that is expected to be approved at the WCO Council next month. 
This  initiative  intends  to  establish  international  standards  for  Customs-to-Customs 
cooperation  concerning  cargo  risk  assessment,  advance  cargo  information  filing  and

70

common  risk  criteria,  and  for  Customs-to-business  partnership  programs,  like  C–
TPAT. 

The  establishment  of  international  security  standards  and  criteria  for  inter-
national supply chains and international cargo shipments is a sound and logical ob-
jective.  The  challenge,  however,  continues  to  be  how  to  obtain  implementation  of 
such  agreed-upon  standards  and  criteria  in  the  absence  of  a  binding  international 
instrument.  The  framework  and  its  supporting  documents  are  expected  to  be  ap-
proved by the WCO Council through a recommendation that invites WCO members 
to  implement  it  in  accordance  with  individually  established  timeframes  and  each 
member country’s capabilities. Thus, rather than early international acceptance and 
implementation  of  the  framework,  we  could  see  the  framework  serve  as  a  induce-
ment for the establishment of bi- and multilateral Customs agreements where indi-
vidual Customs authorities agree to cooperate on the establishment of joint risk as-
sessment  programs,  the  advance  filing  of  common  cargo  information  and  perhaps 
also  on  the  mutual  recognition  of  each  other’s  partnership  programs.  To  the  extent 
such individual Customs agreements were to cover a ‘‘critical mass’’ of global trade, 
they  could  eventually  establish  the  minimum  standards  that  all  trading  nations 
would  have  to  implement  or  risk  seeing  their  export  opportunities  being  curtailed. 
Such a development would not happen over night. Nor would the attendant bene-
fits  for  business  in  terms  of  mutual  recognition  and  simplified  and  uniform  filing 
requirements.  But  absent  an  international  regulatory  mechanism  for  supply  chain 
and  cargo  security,  it  appears  to  be  the  only  currently  available  option  internation-
ally for creating uniformity and commonality. 

As  noted  earlier,  however,  it  may  also  be  a  way  for  the  C–TPAT  type  system  to 
be extended to foreign manufacturers in those nations that make a serious commit-
ment to establish and oversee C–TPAT type programs. Today, a U.S. importer is ex-
pected  to  ‘‘ensure’’  that  a  foreign  supplier  is  following  C–TPAT  criteria—a  pretty 
tough challenge. If reliable foreign authorities were to certify foreign manufacturers 
according  to  standards  and  procedures  equivalent  to  CBP’s  certification  of  import-
ers,  confidence  in  enhanced  security  and  shipper  compliance  could  be  greatly  en-
hanced.  This  may  not  work  in  all  nations,  but  it  is  certainly  not  inconceivable  to 
see  the  U.S.  accepting  other  responsible  government  program  certifications  of  their 
manufacturers,  and  foreign  governments’  accepting  U.S.  certification  of  theirs.  This 
model  works  for  ships,  where  foreign  government  certifications  are  accepted  (but 
also  buttressed  by  strong  U.S.  port  state  enforcement),  and  it  could  be  considered 
for supply-chain-security. 
7. Technology and ‘‘Smart’’ Containers 

Technology  clearly  has  a  role  in  increasing  the  efficiency  and  security  of  contain-
erized  cargo  shipments.  X-ray  and  gamma  ray  non-intrusive  container  inspection 
equipment is being deployed at U.S. and foreign ports, as are radiation portal mon-
itors and radiation detectors. 

In  addition  to  these  developments,  there  is  a  discussion  of  ‘‘smart’’  containers. 
What  makes  a  container  ‘‘smart,’’  however,  and  what  the  appropriate  technologies 
may be for such an objective remain unclear. 

The  Council  and  its  member  lines  have  been  working  within  the  International 
Standards Organization RFID container technology working group on standards for 
electronic  container  seals,  container  tags  and  shipment  tags.  We  expect  that,  once 
a seal verification requirement is imposed by U.S. regulation, these technologies will 
be  seriously  considered  as  an  automated,  efficient  way  to  determine  if  containers 
have been tampered with while in transit. 

There  is  also  a  discussion  about  the  possibility  of  the  application  of  shipper-ap-
plied  ‘‘container  security  devices’’  (CSDs).  The  CSDs  currently  being  tested  by  CBP 
only  indicate  whether  one  of  the  container  doors  has  been  opened.  A  properly  ap-
plied  e-seal  may  provide  equivalent  functionality.  Explanations  of  what  a  CSD 
should  accomplish  vary,  and  a  clear  definition  has  not  yet  emerged.  Furthermore, 
other  issues  about  CSDs  that  have  not  been  adequately  addressed,  including  the 
radio  frequency  to  be  used  and  whether  it  would  be  compatible  with  the  emerging 
ISO  standard’s  frequency  for  e-seals,  who  would  read  the  devices,  how  would  they 
know  which  boxes  have  CSDs  to  be  read,  where  they  would  be  read,  who  would  be 
expected  to  build  and  operate  the  reading  infrastructure,  what  would  be  done  with 
the information, the devices’ reliability and accuracy, and what would be done with 
exception reporting. 

There  is  also  discussion  of  a  ‘‘next  generation’’  or  ‘‘Advanced  CSD’’  with  more  so-
phisticated sensors that DHS is researching, which will also need to address a num-
ber of issues, including what specifically is it that needs to be ‘‘sensed,’’ the accuracy 
and reliability of the device, its cost, who applies the device, the reading infrastruc-

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  11:29 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025728 PO 00000 Frm 00074 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\25728.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

71

ture  that  would  be  needed,  who  would  read  it  when  and  where,  and  the  protocols 
for how different readings would be addressed by whom and when. 

The  idea  of  transforming  containers  into  ‘‘smart,’’  impregnable  fortresses  clearly 
has an appeal. Reality, however, requires addressing issues of: technology definition 
and  standards;  false  positives  from  sensor  technologies  and  their  consequences; 
questions  about  device  reliability;  maintenance  complexity;  device  failures  and 
equipment  out  of  service  time;  power  needs  and  failures,  including  battery  life 
issues;  device  costs;  and  labor  issues  and  costs.  In  addition,  technology  can  bring 
new security vulnerabilities that have to be considered. For example, permanent or 
reusable  container  security  technology  devices  would  require  a  capability  to  ‘‘write’’ 
new  information  into  the  device  or  amend  existing  information  in  the  device.  Such 
a capability would require a wide range of parties around the world to be given the 
capability  of  writing  new  information  into  container  security  devices,  which  would 
create  troubling  security  vulnerabilities  of  third  parties  becoming  capable  of  ‘‘hack-
ing’’ into the devices. It is for this very reason that the ISO electronic seal standard 
will  require  that  e-seals  be  one  time  use  seals  without  the  capability  to  write  or 
change the information in the seal. 

As  different  technology  vendors  jockey  for  position,  some  things  are  becoming 

clearer:

1.  Industry  and  government  need  to  cooperate  and  agree  on  what  the  security 
requirements are, and what the respective implementation roles of industry and 
government would be.
2.  Cost  does  matter.  A  decision  to  invest  in  a  particular  technology  applicable 
to  the  global  container  industry  will  be  expensive  and  will  require  assurance 
that government is not likely to abruptly change requirements.
3.  Whatever  technology  is  chosen  for  application  to  international  containerized 
cargo  shipments,  it  will  need  to  be  a  common,  universally  deployable  tech-
nology.
4.  Proprietary  solutions  that  require  a  particular  manufacturer’s  product  or 
reading system will not be acceptable.
5.  Technology  vendors  who  push  products  that  involve  the  vendor  capturing, 
managing, and profiting from all the data generated from the device—and there 
are a number of these—are likely to encounter hard questions, if not strong re-
sistance, from industry.
Cargo  shipment  data  is  the  data  of  the  carrier  and  the  shipper,  and  with  con-
sent,  their  agents.  It  is  appropriate  for  the  importing  and  exporting  nations’ 
governments to have access to this data, but it is not appropriate for third par-
ties to try to use technology to capture it and resell it to other commercial inter-
ests.  Vendors  who  try  to  do  this  will  need  to  address  a  number  of  policy  and 
legal issues.

Summary 

When  addressing  the  issue  of  international  supply-chain-security,  we  find  our-
selves dealing with the consequences of two of the more profound dynamics affecting 
the  world  today.  One  is  the  internationalization  of  the  world  economy,  the  remark-
able growth of world trade, and the U.S. economy’s appetite for imports—a demand 
that  fills  our  ships,  our  ports,  and  our  inland  transportation  infrastructure,  a  de-
mand that will result in more than 11 million U.S. import containers this year, and 
more than 12 million next year, and a demand that will increasingly test our ability 
to move America’s commerce as efficiently as we have in the past. 

The  other  dynamic  is  the  threat  to  our  way  of  life  from  terrorists  and  the  chal-
lenge  of  addressing  the  vulnerabilities  that  exist  in  the  free  flow  of  international 
trade, even when the specific risk is elusive or impossible to identify. 

Finding  the  correct,  reasonable  balance  between  prudent  security  measures  and 

overreacting in a way that impairs commerce is a tough challenge. 

We  are  making  real  progress  in  addressing  these  challenges,  but  that  the  effort 
to  address  them  more  effectively  must  continue.  In  particular,  it  would  be  helpful 
to  develop  a  blueprint  or  framework  that  identifies  the  specific  security  gaps  and 
security  requirements  in  the  supply-chain-security  system,  so  that  government  and 
industry  can  all  understand,  target  and  prioritize  the  development  of  appropriate 
solutions needed to address the appropriate, correct, and agreed requirements. 

DHS continues to refine and extend its maritime and cargo security regime. This 
year we expect to see major rulemakings dealing with container seal verification re-
quirements  and  with  the  issuance  of  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Cards,  a 
Departmental  determination  of  what  additional  cargo  shipment  data  needs  to  be

given  to  CBP  to  enhance  the  cargos  security  screening  system,  and  a  continued  re-
view of the C–TPAT program. 

Mr.  Chairman,  the  World  Shipping  Council  and  our  member  companies  believe 
that there is no task more important than helping the government develop effective 
maritime  and  cargo  security  initiatives  that  do  not  unduly  impair  the  flow  of  com-
merce.  We  are  pleased  to  offer  the  Committee  our  views  and  assistance  in  this  ef-
fort.

The CHAIRMAN. Well, thank you very much. 
One of the things that was of interest to me when I went to Los 
Angeles  was  the  enormous  growth  of  waterborne  imports  into  the 
U.S.  I  understand  the  economic  analysis  of  that,  it’s  about  $40.5 
billion  a  year  coming  into  our  ports.  But,  contrary  to  the  pas-
sengers  on  airlines,  and  contrary  to  any  other  system  that  we’ve 
got,  that  is  entirely  free  from  any  contribution  to  the  security  as-
pects  we’re  talking  about.  I’m  told  that  a  4.3  percent  fee,  similar 
to  one  this  Committee  has  imposed  upon  airline  passengers,  of 
twice that much, would bring in at least $1.7 billion annually. 

Now,  what  do  you  say  about  that?  Why  shouldn’t  these  imports 
contribute  to  the  cost  of  this  security?  Why  should  we  constantly 
take it from tax money? That’s what we’re talking about, these ad-
ditions,  these  amounts  that  each  witness  has  asked  for  this  morn-
ing,  in  effect,  more  money.  But  why  not  get  it  from  the  fees  on 
these  imports,  like  we  tax  the  American  passengers  as  they  fly  on 
the airlines? 

Ms.  GODWIN.  There  are  fees  assessed  at—by  ports  at  the  local 
level. You’re correct, there is no national or federal fee imposed on 
cargo  that’s  specifically  dedicated  to  security.  There  are  a  lot  of 
other federal fees and taxes, obviously, on maritime——

The CHAIRMAN. Those fees that——
Ms.  GODWIN.—cargo  that  go  into  the  general  treasury,  and  Cus-
toms  duties  attributable  to  maritime  commerce.  But  a  number  of 
ports  have  assessed  fees  individually  at  the  port  for  security  en-
hancements at that particular location. And——

The  CHAIRMAN.  Yes,  I  understand  they’re  starting  that  in  L.A., 
but I don’t think they’ve reached that magnitude, and I don’t think 
many  of  the  costs  involved,  even  in  the  Los  Angeles  port,  are  fed-
eral  costs.  Having  the  local  areas  increase  their  revenue  does  not 
help us meet the demands that we’ve heard here today. 

Ms.  GODWIN.  That’s  true.  But  when  the  port  is  collecting  fees 
they  are  using  it  to  reimburse  their  own  costs,  in  terms  of  oper-
ations and maintenance and personnel costs, which aren’t even eli-
gible  for  the  Port  Security  Grants  at  this  point.  But  there  are  a 
number—as I said, a number of other federal fees and taxes attrib-
utable  to  maritime  commerce.  No  amount  of  that  funding  is  dedi-
cated  to  security.  It’s  just  not  set  aside  for  security.  I  know  there 
have been proposals discussed to take a portion of Customs duties, 
for example, that’s collected on maritime commerce, and to set that 
aside to pay for security enhancements. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  The  Customs  inspection  fee  on  a  cruise  ship  is 
$2 per passenger. I know of no similar fee paid to the Federal Gov-
ernment from imports coming into the United States. 

Mr. Koch? 
Mr. KOCH. Mr. Chairman, it’s a fair question, but I think, really, 
here’s  where  I  would  propose  you  start  the  analysis.  The  Coast 
Guard’s  analysis  of  what  its  vessel  and  port-facility  regulations 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  11:29 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025728 PO 00000 Frm 00076 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\25728.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

were going to cost the industry was $8 billion over 10 years, so in-
dustry will be spending $8 billion to comply with the MTSA regula-
tions.  That  cost  estimate  does  not  include  the  cost  of  the  foreign 
flag  vessels’  compliance  with  the  Coast  Guard  regulations.  It  does 
not  include  foreign  ports’  compliance  with  the  ISPS  Code  regula-
tions. So, there are many billions of dollars already being spent. 

When  looking  at  what  additional  federal  funding  needs  to  be 
done,  I  think  there  really  needs  to  be  some  clarity  as  to:  What 
would  we  be  spending  the  money  for?  And  that  has  been  a  debate 
that has been vaguer than it should be. It’s easy to talk about how 
much  money  should  be  given  to  ports.  The  real  question,  as  you 
heard  from  GAO  earlier  today,  is,  What  is  the  money  actually 
needed  for?  All  port  facilities  today  are  compliant  with  the  ISPS 
Code the MTSA regs. So if we’re going to go ahead and look to tax 
commerce  an  additional  amount,  I  think  there  really  needs  to  be 
clarity  given  to  specifically  what  is  it  that  the  money  is  going  to 
be  spent  for  and  is  there  a  way  to  make  sure  that  the  money  that 
would be collected actually is spent on those things? 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  as  you  know,  the  money  that  comes  from 
air cargo, domestically, is taxed at 6.25 percent. And that goes into 
the  FAA  trust  fund.  We  could  very  easily,  on  this  Committee,  cre-
ate a similar trust fund. These aren’t taxes, these are fees paid on 
cargo,  and  it  goes  into  the  FAA  trust  fund  created  by  this  Com-
mittee.  I’m  seriously  thinking  about  asking  this  Committee  to  cre-
ate  a  trust  fund  for  port  security.  That  would  be  augmented,  I’m 
sure,  by  federal  expenditures,  augmented  by  other  expenditures 
made  by  the  ports  themselves.  But  I—there’s  no  question  that  the 
system  needs  more  money,  but  when  we  faced  that  problem  with 
air  commerce,  the  passengers  and  the  cargo  paid  the  fee,  a  sub-
stantial part of it. 
Senator Inouye? 
Senator INOUYE. Mr. Chairman, you are absolutely correct. Right 
now  the  Administration  is  requesting  a  huge  sum  of  money  based 
upon passenger security fees. 

My question is a very broad one. You have given us some of your 
problems  and  some  of  your  suggestions.  You  have  now  been  work-
ing on this since September 11th. Are we in better shape today, or 
no change at all, or worse? 

Mr.  KOCH.  I  think  we’re  clearly  in  better  shape.  Are  we  where 
we  want  to  be?  No.  I  think  the  programs  Customs  has  launched, 
in  terms  of  the  risk  assessment,  CSI,  C–TPAT,  have  all  enhanced 
security.  The  Coast  Guard’s  missions  in  dealing  with  vessel  secu-
rity  and  port-facility  security  clearly  have  enhanced  security.  Ac-
cess control is much better. 

Our improvements must also recognize the volumes of containers 
we are moving. Last year it was 10 million import containers; this 
year,  it’ll  it  be  over  11  million;  next  year,  it’ll  be  over  12  million. 
So,  we  see  this  enormous  expansion  of  world  trade  and  all  the 
cargo  moving,  and  we  have  to  figure  out  how  to  improve  security 
efficiently. 

We’re  trying  to  deal  with  this  tension  between  efficiently  han-
dling  huge  volumes  of  cargo  and  dealing  with  the  terrorist  risk  to 
free  trade  and  free  societies.  It’s  a  very  interesting  cross-section  of 
conflict.

I  think  we’re  doing  well.  I  think  we  clearly  need  to  do  better.  I 
think  both  AAPA  and  ourselves  have  offered  suggestions  to  the 
government  on  how  to  do  that,  and  it’s  going  to  be  an  ongoing  ef-
fort.  But  improving  risk  assessment,  improving  CSI,  improving 
overseas inspections, further deployment of the radiation inspection 
equipment,  not  only  here,  but  abroad,  all  are  things  that  will  be 
helpful. It’s going to take a little time to get there, but we are mak-
ing clear progress. 

Senator  INOUYE.  Following  up  on  the  Chairman’s  questioning, 
when  we  improve  our  security,  and  when  we  improve  our  process 
and expedite movement, a major beneficiary would be those foreign 
shippers.  Don’t  you  think  they  should  pay  a  little  fee  that  could 
bring this about? 

Mr.  KOCH.  Well,  my  observation  is,  they  are  paying  more  today 
for security. A number of ports are charging security fees. Carriers 
are  trying  to  pass  on  their  costs  to  shippers  through  higher  rates. 
The  terminal  operators  are  passing  on  their  higher  costs.  So  the 
market already is building in increased costs that are being passed 
on to shippers. 

And,  as  the  discussion  we’ve  had  with  Senator  Stevens,  if  there 
are specific things that the government needs to assess a fee on for 
enhanced security, I think shippers would look at that. I think the 
frustration  that  has  existed  in  this  debate,  up  to  this  point,  has 
been  a  generalized  discussion  of,  ‘‘Let’s  spend  more  money,’’  with-
out  tying  it  clearly  to,  ‘‘Spend  it  for  what?’’  And  it’s  the  ‘‘spending 
it  for  what’’  that  is  the  harder  question,  because  everybody  under-
stands  we  need  to  enhance  security,  but  the  question  is—let’s  not 
just create a trust fund that’s a generalized trust fund that doesn’t 
have  specific  needs  that  there’s  a  consensus  should  be  funded 
through that kind of mechanism. 

Senator  INOUYE.  I  believe  it  would  be  very  helpful  to  the  Com-
mittee  if  you  could  provide  us  with  a  report  on  what  sort  of  fees 
that these others are paying. Because I have no idea. And what the 
load  is  like.  If  we  did,  we  might  think  differently.  That  would  be 
extremely helpful. 

And,  Ms.  Godwin,  what  did  you  think  of  the  Inspector  General’s 
report, the fact that it takes so long for security clearance and that 
some  of  the  grantees  were  really  not  prepared  to  receive  grant 
funds? 

Ms.  GODWIN.  I  think  there  are  some  very  legitimate  points  that 
came  out  in  the  report.  Our  members  have  been  concerned  about 
the  security-clearance  issue,  as  well.  In  terms  of  the  time  lag  for 
the grant money to be spent, I know one of the issues is that when 
you fill out an application to receive a grant, it’s essentially an out-
line  of  what  you  might  propose  to  do.  You  type  it  in  on  the  com-
puter.  There’s  a  limited  amount  of  space.  It’s  not  a  very  detailed 
proposal. Once you are approved to receive a grant, there’s a period 
of  time,  over  months,  where  the  sponsor—the  Port  Authority,  in 
this case—might be negotiating with the Department of Homeland 
Security to refine that proposal, to get some specific amounts, how 
the money would be allocated, to really get a more definitive grant 
proposal  approved.  And  once  that  is  approved,  they  start  the  proc-
ess  of  bidding  out  contracts.  So,  there  is  a  fairly  long  time  lag  be-
fore the money is actually spent.

Senator  INOUYE.  Have  you  been  called  upon  to  provide  an  input 

75

on the process itself? 

Ms. GODWIN. We’ve been consulted by DHS off and on in a num-
ber  of  different  areas.  I  can’t  say  that  we  are  at  the  table  when 
these  decisions  are  being  made,  but  they  have  reached  out  to  us. 

Senator INOUYE. Thank you very much. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Vitter? 

STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID VITTER,

U.S. SENATOR FROM LOUISIANA 

Senator VITTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Ms.  Godwin,  I  have  some  concerns  about  the  process  and  how 
those funds are distributed. Am I following things right and under-
standing  under  that  new  program  66  ports  are  eligible  and  there 
for small ports are pretty much excluded. 

Ms.  GODWIN.  Sixty-six  port  areas  are  eligible.  It  depends.  There 
may  be  more  than  one  port  that’s  within  a  mile  of  a  navigation 
channel.  But,  yes,  it  is  a  limited  universe  of  potential  applicants. 
Their  initial  starting  point  for  creating  that  list  was  based  on  vol-
ume,  they  started  with  the  largest,  in  terms  of  volume,  129  ports 
in  the  country,  based  on  the  Corps  of  Engineers’  data.  There  are 
a lot of ports that have less volume that are left off that list. That’s 
correct. 

Senator VITTER. From a Louisiana perspective, what I’m particu-
larly  concerned  about  is  this  focus  on  volume,  which  leaves  out  a 
lot  of  oil-and-gas  service-related  ports—for  instance,  in  south  Lou-
isiana.  Now,  one  of  those  ports  that  I  can  think  of—literally  one, 
Port Fourchon, accounts for servicing 20 percent of the Nation’s oil 
and gas production. 

Ms. GODWIN. Right. 
Senator VITTER. Do you think that’s a little skewed, the fact that 
there is this focus on volume that doesn’t take into account the sig-
nificance of the port activity, like that related to energy production? 
Ms.  GODWIN.  I  think  that  would  be  a  good  example,  that  would 
illustrate  why  cutting  off  those  who  can  even  apply  in  the  first 
place is probably not the best way to look at risk—you know, risk-
based decision-making. People ought to be able to come in and file 
an  application  and  make  their  case  on  why  they  should  be  eligible 
for  funding,  and  explain  the  risk-based  factors  about  that  port. 
Looking  strictly  at  volume,  as  a  starting  point,  and  then  applying 
a formula to that, you may see some ports left off the list that don’t 
make  any  sense  if  you  actually  had  the  specific  facts  about  that 
port. 

Senator  VITTER.  Well,  I  would  agree  with  you.  And  I  think 
Fourchon,  in  Louisiana,  is  a  great  example,  because  it  will  never 
be ranked high in volume, because it’s not a cargo, sort of, volume-
based  port;  it’s  a  port  that  services  the  oil  and  gas  sector.  And  if 
it  were  shut  down  tomorrow,  we  would  feel  it  the  next  day,  in 
terms of energy availability and prices. 

More  broadly,  could  you  comment  on  the  FY05  application  proc-
ess  as  it  relates  to  the  Inspector  General’s  findings  and  the  9/11 
Commission Report? 

Ms.  GODWIN.  I  think  they’ve  tried  to  make  an  effort  to  address 
some  of  the  issues  that  came  up  in  the  Inspector  General’s  report.

I  know  one  of  the  criticisms  was  having  more  clearly-defined  cri-
teria  of  how  the  local  Captain  of  the  Port  would  assess  a  project 
versus how the National Review Team would assess a project, and 
trying to resolve some of those areas of confusion. But we were, to 
be  honest,  caught  by  surprise  at  the  idea  of  limiting  the  applicant 
pool in the first place. 

Senator VITTER. OK. And that fundamental limitation, would you 
consider that basically an unfunded mandate for everybody’s who’s 
off the list? 

Ms. GODWIN. It’s definitely an unfunded mandate. And I remem-
ber,  when  I  was  here  for  the  hearing  that  this  Committee  had  in 
February,  a  number  of  Senators  spoke  very  eloquently  about  the 
need to protect all airports in this country, not just the largest air-
ports.  And  certainly  the  same  case  could  be  said  for  ports.  We  do 
not  want  to  leave  a  soft  underbelly  somewhere  in  this  country  by 
a kind of arbitrary ranking. That doesn’t mean that risk-based de-
cision-making isn’t perfectly appropriate, but you have to look at it 
in the entire context, and not prevent people from being able to at 
least compete for the funding and make a case. 

Senator VITTER. OK. And the last question for both of you, What 
are your comments about the proposed consolidation of the port-se-
curity  program  into  an  overall  infrastructure-security  grant  pro-
gram? 

Ms.  GODWIN.  As  I’m  sure  you  heard  in  my  statement,  we  are 
adamantly opposed to it. We are thrilled that the House Appropria-
tions Committee has taken a stand, and we strongly encourage the 
Senate to do the same. 

Senator VITTER. Right. 
Mr. KOCH. Sir, we don’t really have any comments on that. 
Senator VITTER. OK. 
All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator. Glad to see you. 
Senator Rockefeller? 
Senator BILL NELSON. Oh, he’s not here. 
The CHAIRMAN. Pardon me. 
Senator Bill Nelson? 

STATEMENT OF HON. BILL NELSON,

U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA 

Senator  BILL NELSON.  For  me  to  be  mixed  up  with  Senator 

Rockefeller is, indeed, a privilege, Mr. Chairman. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  BILL NELSON.  Mr.  Chairman,  having  grown  up  in  Flor-
ida  on  the  tales  and  the  stories  of  the  swashbuckling  days  of  pi-
rates  of  the  Caribbean,  unfortunately  we’re  starting  to  see  a  reoc-
currence of those pirates of the Caribbean. We’re seeing several in-
stances  that  have  happened  off  of  Brazil,  off  of  Venezuela,  and  off 
of Colombia. 

And Jane’s Defence Weekly, is indicating to us that new evidence 
shows  that  terrorist  organizations  are  entering  the  fray  with  ter-
rorists and insurgents using the sea as a launchpad for brutal acts 
to  move  operatives  and  to  smuggle  drugs  and  counterfeit  goods  to 
fund their operations. And it goes on to say international terrorists

77

are  now  operating  in  piracy  areas,  adopting  the  techniques  and 
acts of pirates or franchising their cause to local insurgent groups. 
The  Caribbean’s  an  area  that  I  have  considerable  concern  about 
port  security,  from  the  standpoint  of  several  of  the  ports  that  I’ve 
visited  in  the  Caribbean,  and  that  they  are  supposed  to  be  secure 
ports, and, in fact, they are not. 

Now,  with  the  added  dimension  of  piracy  adding  to  our  question 

of defense of the homeland, I’d like to have your comments. 

Mr. KOCH. Senator, I don’t have direct information that would be 
terribly insightful on specific countries. I do know the Coast Guard 
has  established  the  International  Port  Security  Assessment  Pro-
gram,  whose  purpose  is  to  go  to  these  foreign  countries,  do  assess-
ments  of  the  foreign  port  facilities,  determine  if  they’re  complying 
with  the  international  rules  and  the  Coast  Guard’s  expectations, 
and  trying  then  to  help  them  if  they  are  not  meeting  them.  You 
might  want  to  ask  the  Coast  Guard  what  their  assessments  have 
been  throughout  the  Caribbean  and  at  their  particular  places 
there. 

I know, from the liner-industry perspective, I’m not aware of par-
ticular  acts  of  piracy  that  our  members  have  encountered  in  the 
Caribbean.  There  are  certainly  the  drug  cartels  and  cargo  theft  in 
some  parts  of  Central  America,  which  has  clearly  been  a  problem 
in  the  past,  and  it’s  one  we’re  always  vigilant  about.  But  in  terms 
of  the  port-security  piracy  issues,  I  suspect  the  Coast  Guard  may 
be able to give you some data that would not be something I could. 
Senator  BILL NELSON.  Well,  I’m  interested  in  the  answer  from 

your standpoint. How about the port authorities, Ms. Godwin? 

Ms.  GODWIN.  The  ports  in  the  Caribbean?  I  mean,  they’re  sup-
posed  to  all  be  in  compliance  with  the  ISPS  Code.  I  am  not  aware 
of any that have been found not to be in compliance. 

Senator  BILL NELSON.  OK.  I  can  tell  you  they’re  not.  And  if  the 
American  Association  of  Port  Authorities  doesn’t  know  that,  then 
I’m  concerned  about  it.  And  if  the  World  Shipping  Council  doesn’t 
know  that,  I’m  concerned  about  it.  Because  with  as  little  that  we 
inspect the inbound cargo containers, and if these foreign ports are 
not  in  compliance,  it  seems  like  we’ve  got  a  big  hole  right  there. 
Mr.  KOCH.  The  Coast  Guard,  at  the  present  time,  has  identified 
five jurisdictions that do not have adequate port security. I believe 
they’re  African  ports.  To  the  best  of  my  knowledge,  they  have  not 
identified  any  in  the  Caribbean,  at  this  point.  If  they  are  not  com-
pliant,  then  the  Coast  Guard  needs  to  put  them  on  the  list  saying 
that they are not compliant, and that needs to be put into the Cus-
toms  Targeting  System  so  that  cargo  coming  through  those  ports 
is targeted appropriately, as well as the vessels. 

Senator  BILL NELSON.  OK.  And  then,  on  the  basis  of  your  an-
swer,  Mr.  Chairman,  what  I’m  going  to  do  is  proffer  a  number  of 
questions  to  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  on  this  issue, 
because  of  the  lack  of  compliance,  why  they’re  saying  that  these 
ports have complied, when, in fact, there’s a huge hole in the safety 
net that we’re supposed to be extending out beyond. 

All  right,  let’s  talk  about  tamper-resistant  containers.  You  know 
we’re trying to put seals on containers. Why don’t you give me the 
value of your opinion there?

Mr.  KOCH.  We  have  advocated  a  seal-verification  rule.  One  is 
being drafted at the present time by Customs and the Department 
of  Homeland  Security.  Our  expectation  is  that  that  rule  would  re-
quire  that,  before  a  container  is  loaded  in  a  foreign  port  for  the 
U.S.,  that  we  will  have  to  go  verify  the  seal  on  that  box.  We  sup-
port that, support the elements that will have to go into that rule-
making, including defining the standard of the seal and the various 
responsibilities of the parties to do all that. It’s a big challenge, but 
we think it does make a lot of sense. 

When that is in place—that obligation is in place—we will expect 
technology  to  be  coming  forward  rather  rapidly  to  help  us  imple-
ment that. We have been spending a lot of time investigating RFID 
electronic  seals  for  containers.  We  don’t  have,  yet,  a  standard  for 
that  technology  in  place  that  can  identify  the  frequency  and  the 
various  parameters  to  make  it  work,  but  we  expect,  by  the  end  of 
this  year,  that  that  standard  should  be  in  place,  and,  with  a  seal-
verification rulemaking, we’d start seeing electronic seals being put 
on boxes sometime in the foreseeable future. 

Senator BILL NELSON. Ms. Godwin? 
Ms. GODWIN. I’m not sure I can add anything to that. That’s cer-
tainly  an  important  component  of  cargo  security,  and  we’re  hoping 
to see progress in that area. 

Senator BILL NELSON. OK. And I will send those questions to the 
Department  of  Homeland  Security,  as  well  as  questions  with  re-
gard  to  their  progress  under  a  new  law  on  cruise  ships,  that  they 
would have to check the manifest before the cruise ship leaves the 
port.  They  had  180  days  in  which  to  implement  this  new  law  that 
I had a little bit to do with. We are now at day 151 of the 180 days, 
and I will—would like to have a written response on how they are 
progressing, since it’s getting near the time for implementation. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator INOUYE [presiding]. Thank you very much. 
Before  I  call  this  adjournment,  I’d  like  to  announce  that  the 
record  will  be  kept  open  for  2  weeks.  If  any  of  the  witnesses  wish 
to provide addendum or corrections, please feel free to do so. Some 
of  the  Committee  Members  are  not  here,  but  they  have  submitted 
questions, which we will forward to you, and we hope that you will 
be able to respond to them. 

Our  next  hearing  will  be  held  tomorrow  morning  at  10  o’clock. 
At that time, we will receive testimony on the nomination of senior 
officials of the Department of Commerce. 

Thank you very much. 
[Whereupon, at 11:45 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

A P P E N D I X

WORLD SHIPPING COUNCIL 
Washington, DC, June 14, 2005

Hon. TED STEVENS, 
Chairman, 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 
Washington, DC.
Dear Mr. Chairman:

I would like to thank you for the opportunity to testify before the Commerce Com-
mittee  on  May  17th  regarding  port,  maritime  and  cargo  security  issues.  The  World 
Shipping Council, which represents the international liner shipping industry serving 
America’s  international  trade,  appreciates  your  continued  oversight  and  leadership 
regarding  enhancing  maritime  and  cargo  security  while  facilitating  the  free  flow  of 
legitimate commerce into and out of the United States. 

One of the issues that was briefly discussed during the hearing was port security 
funding.  As  you  know,  during  the  last  Congress,  Senator  Hollings  proposed  a  port 
security container tax as an amendment to the 2004 Maritime Transportation Secu-
rity Act (S. 2279). This amendment was opposed by 76 organizations, including the 
World  Shipping  Council.  representing  virtually  every  facet  of  U.S.  maritime  com-
merce,  and  the  amendment  was  rejected  during  committee  markup  of  the  bill.  We 
very much appreciated your support in opposing that amendment. 

During  the  May  17th  hearing,  you  asked  the  industry  panelists,  namely  myself 
and  Ms.  Jean  Godwin  of  the  American  Association  of  Port  Authorities,  to  comment 
on  the  concept  of  establishing  a  new  tax  or  fee  on  import  cargo  containers  to  pay 
for port security expenses. While I commented briefly on this issue during the hear-
ing,  I  would  like  to  offer  the  following  additional  comments,  for  inclusion  in  the 
hearing record, which I hope will assist the Committee in considering this issue. 

In  my  oral  response  to  your  question  during  the  hearing,  I  noted  that,  although 
some  interests  have  advocated  for  increases  in  the  total  amount  of  annual  Port  Se-
curity  Grant  monies  dispersed  by  the  Federal  Government,  no  one  has  yet  clearly 
or  specifically  defined  what  it  is  that  additional  federal  port  security  funds  should 
appropriately pay for. 

U.S.  port  facilities  and  the  vessels  that  call  on  them  are  in  compliance  with  the 
International  Ship  &  Port  Facility  Security  Code  (ISPS  Code)  and  the  Maritime 
Transportation  Security  Act  (MTSA)  security  regulations  promulgated  by  the  U.S. 
Coast  Guard.  Port  facilities  and  vessels  have  developed  and  implemented  approved 
security plans. In fact, we are not aware of a single, major U.S. port or port facility 
that  is  not  currently  in  compliance  with  the  Coast  Guard’s  maritime  security  re-
quirements. 

The costs of implementing these security requirements have been significant. The 
Coast Guard has estimated that it will cost U.S. port facilities and flag vessels $8.8 
billion  over  10  years;  however,  these  compliance  costs  are  already  being  borne  by 
the  industry.  There  is  no  need  for  a  new  tax  and  a  new  federal  funding  program 
to address these costs. 

The Coast Guard’s cost estimates are the costs that would be borne by the indus-
try to comply with its maritime security requirements, not the cost the Federal Gov-
ernment  would  bear.  These  cost  estimates  were  actually  on  the  low  side.  as  they 
did not include the costs incurred by the thousands of foreign-flag vessels that were 
required  by  the  Coast  Guard’s  regulations  to  become  certified  under  the  Inter-
national Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code or the costs incurred by foreign 
ports and port facilities in becoming compliant with the ISPS Code. 

In  addition  to  the  costs  to  comply  with  required  vessel  and  port  facility  security 
requirements,  the  maritime  industry  and  its  customers  have  expended  substantial 
sums to comply with the requirements of the U.S. Government’s cargo security pro-
grams. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) estimated that the cost to indus-
try  to  comply  with  the  Trade  Act  advance  cargo  information  filing  requirements

would  amount  to  over  $4.7  billion.  Those  estimates  did  not,  however,  include  the 
millions  of  dollars  of  costs  incurred  by  ocean  carriers  to  implement  the  agency’s  24 
Hour Rule advance manifest filing requirements. Second, U.S. importers, ocean car-
riers,  truckers,  railroads,  air  carriers,  brokers,  and  freight  forwarders,  among  oth-
ers, have expended millions of dollars each year to voluntarily implement the secu-
rity  requirements  of  the  Customs-Trade  Partnership  Against  Terrorism  (C–TPAT) 
program.  And  third,  later  this  year,  the  maritime  industry  will  face  another  very 
expensive  security  requirement  when  CBP  issues  rules  requiring  installation  and 
verification of high-security seals on all import cargo containers. 

The purpose of stating this is not that the liner shipping industry is complaining 
about  these  costs.  We  understand  the  need  to  develop  and  implement  prudent,  en-
hanced  maritime  security  measures  in  the  fight  against  terrorist  threats.  It  is  im-
portant to recognize, however, that substantial costs are already being borne by the 
maritime  industry  to  address  and  improve  maritime  security,  and  we  see  no  basis 
for imposing a new, additional federal security tax on the industry. 

Today,  Federal  agencies  levy  127  taxes  and  fees  on  the  maritime  industry,  col-
lecting roughly $22 billion per year. Approximately $20 billion of this amount is col-
lected  in  Customs  fees  that  are  not  earmarked  for  specific  purposes  and  are  depos-
ited in the General Fund of the Treasury. We believe that creation of an additional 
federal tax or fee on maritime cargo containers would be unjustifiable given the sub-
stantial  revenue  generated  through  existing  taxes  and  fees  and  given  the  substan-
tial  expenditures  the  industry  is  already  incurring  to  comply  with  new  security 
rules. 

In  short,  port,  vessel  and  cargo  security  requirements,  are  currently  being  met 
and  their  costs  borne  by  the  maritime  industry.  We  have  seen  no  explanation  of 
what  unmet  port  security  costs  would  justify  a  new  federal  tax.  Furthermore,  we 
note  that  ports  have  the  authority,  and  are  using  their  authority,  to  impose  addi-
tional charges at the local level when such measures are needed to cover additional 
security  costs.  For  example,  the  ports  of  Charleston,  Savannah,  Portland  (Oregon), 
Hampton Roads, New Orleans, Houston, Mobile, Los Angeles and Long Beach have 
increased  the  fees  on  commerce  in  their  port  to  raise  additional  revenues  for  secu-
rity  measures.  There  is  no  need  or  justification  for  a  new  federal  tax  to  cover  costs 
already being paid for by the industry. 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment further on this important issue. 

Sincerely yours, 

CHRISTOPHER L. KOCH, 

President/CEO. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO

RICHARD L. SKINNER 

Question 1. I understand you are currently conducting work on CBP’s Automated 
Targeting System (ATS). When do you expect to have that report completed? Would 
you  be  able  to  testify  before  this  Committee  on  that  report  when  it  is  completed? 
Answer. Our report, ‘‘Audit of Targeting Oceangoing Cargo Containers’’ (OIG–05–
26),  which  is  designated  FOUO,  will  be  released  to  the  Congress  on  July  26,  2005. 
A public summary will be released on August 2, 2005. We would be happy to testify 
on our work.

Question 2. I appreciate the work your Department did on the Port Security Grant 
Program as it provided many insights into some of the program’s problem areas that 
we  continue  to  conduct  oversight  of  and  are  working  in  consultation  with  the  De-
partment  to  rectify.  I  realize  the  guidance  for  this  year’s  round  of  port  security 
grants was just released last week. Have you had an opportunity to review the De-
partment’s  guidelines  and  assess  if  your  recommendations  are  being  implemented? 
Answer.  We  are  reviewing  the  Department’s  FY  2005  Port  Security  Grant  Pro-
gram Guidelines and Application Kit, and evaluating the complex funding allocation 
model  for  the  program,  which  we  received  earlier  this  month.  We  are  encouraged 
by  the  substantive  changes  to  the  design  of  the  program  reflected  in  these  docu-
ments.  However,  while  it  appears  that  substantive  changes  are  imminent,  we  have 
not  evaluated  the  effect  of  these  changes—the  criteria  program  administrators  will 
use  and  how  they  will  apply  it  during  the  evaluation  process—and  whether  those 
modifications satisfy our recommendations. 

We  are  awaiting  additional  details  from  the  Department  supporting  its  action 
plan in response to our recommendations. The Department has not yet provided its 
internal  guidance  that  SLGCP,  USCG,  TSA,  CBP,  IAIP,  and  MARAD  representa-

RICHARD L. SKINNER 

Question. Your office found major problems with the port security grant program, 
mainly  that  funds  are  not  being  distributed  on  the  basis  of  security  risk.  Have  you 
performed  any  follow-up  to  ensure  that  the  $140  million  DHS  will  distribute  this 
year won’t have the same problems? 

Answer.  In  our  final  report  transmittal,  we  requested  that  DHS  advise  our  office 
within  90  days  of  its  progress  in  implementing  our  recommendations.  In  its  action 
plan,  DHS  outlined  steps  already  taken  and  other  significant  changes  planned  for 
the next round of port security grants. In addition to the Department’s action plan, 
we are reviewing the FY 2005 Port Security Grant Program Guidelines and Applica-
tion Kit, and complex funding allocation model for the program. We are encouraged 
by  the  substantive  changes  to  the  design  of  the  program  reflected  in  these  docu-
ments.  However,  while  it  appears  that  substantive  changes  are  imminent,  we  have 
not  evaluated  the  effect  of  these  changes—the  criteria  program  administrators  will 
use  and  how  they  will  apply  it  during  the  evaluation  process—and  whether  those 
modifications satisfy our recommendations. 

We  requested  additional  documentation  in  order  to  better  understand  how  DHS 
is modifying the port security grant application review process. The Department has 
not  yet  provided  its  internal  guidance  that  SLGCP,  USCG,  TSA,  CBP,  IAIP,  and 
MARAD  representatives  will  use  to  evaluate  projects,  i.e.,  the  field  evaluation  cri-
teria  and  the  National  Review  Process  guidance.  We  intend  to  discuss  the  revised 
port security grant application review process with program officials after reviewing 
this  information.  Upon  completing  our  analysis,  we  will  communicate  the  status  of 
the recommendations to SLGCP.

Question. Do you have any concerns with the recent guidance announced by DHS 

to award this year’s appropriations of port security grant funds? 

Answer. Yes, AAPA is very concerned over the recent changes in the program. Of 
most  concern  is  the  change  to  limit  eligibility  to  the  largest  risk  ports.  DHS  pre-
selected  66  ports  which  are  eligible  for  this  5th  round.  Nearly  half  of  the  U.S.  port 
authorities  that  AAPA  represents  are  no  longer  eligible  for  this  program.  The  Port 
Security  Grant  (PSG)  Program  was  established  to  help  ports  harden  their  infra-
structure and to comply with the improvements required under the Maritime Trans-
portation  Security  Act  (MTSA).  The  language  in  the  law  call  for  a  ‘‘fair  and  equi-
table  allocation’’  of  funds.  AAPA  believes  that  limiting  eligibility  is  in  conflict  with 
this provision of the law. All port authorities must comply with the MTSA, and con-
tinual improvements at some ports will stop without federal help. All should be eli-
gible. 

While AAPA agrees that the program should be risk-based, we believe the defini-
tion of risk must be broadened from what we see this last round. A group of under-
protected  ports  is  also  a  risk  to  this  Nation,  especially  in  terms  of  importing  weap-
ons  of  mass  destruction  or  smuggling  in  terrorists.  These  facilities  are  all  inter-
national borders. The program should take into account national economic, strategic 
defense,  regional  transportation  systems,  availability  of  alternative  systems  to  de-
liver  critical  cargos,  the  importance  of  a  port’s  mission  to  federal  agencies  such  as 
the  Department  of  Defense  and  Department  of  Energy,  the  proximity  to  other  ter-
rorist  targets  and  loss  of  life.  The  grants  should  go  to  fund  security  improvements 
to  implement  Area  Maritime  Transportation  Security  plans  and  to  make  improve-
ments to facility security plans, and should not limit eligibility.

Question.  Given  the  President’s  budget  cuts  and  fiscal  restraints,  how  are  we 
going  to  effectively  protect  our  ports,  particularly  with  respect  to  the  port  security 
grant program?

Answer.  Each  year  only  a  small  part  of  the  homeland  security  federal  spending 
is  devoted  to  help  port  facilities  increase  security.  In  FY05,  Congress  appropriated 
only  $150  million  for  the  Port  Security  Grant  Program.  AAPA  recommends  a  fund-
ing level of $400 million. In terms of priorities, maritime security is a very high pri-
ority,  but  far  more  funds  go  to  state  and  local  program  for  response  and  training 
programs. While these are important programs, prevention should be this country’s 
first  job.  And  maritime  security,  because  of  the  economic  impact  of  ports,  their 
cruise and ferry passengers, and national defense assistance, should be a high fund-
ing priority. A re-allocation of priorities within the budget is the best way to address 
this issue. Some have proposed a fee on maritime commerce. However, the maritime 
industry  already  pays  billions  of  dollars  in  user  fees  and  taxes  to  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment,  including  $17.5  billion  Customs  duties  collected  in  fiscal  2003.  If  a  dedi-
cated  source  of  funding  is  required,  AAPA  believes  that  Customs  duties  should  be 
used as a source.

Question. 

In  your  report  on 

Identification 
Credentialing Program, you found several problems with implementation to the pro-
gram,  not  the  least  of  which  was  the  lack  of  a  comprehensive  project  management 
plan. Do you know if TSA has satisfied this recommendation? 

the  Transportation  Worker 

Answer.  In  July  2005  DHS  provided  us  with  an  update  on  the  actions  that  had 
been taken to implement the recommendations contained in our December 2004 re-
port on TSA’s efforts to develop the Transportation Worker Identification Credential 
(TWIC). In this update, DHS stated that TSA had ‘‘significant program management 
controls in place for the prototype program’’ including a Program Management Plan, 
a  Project  Quality  Assurance  Plan,  and  Risk  Assessment  and  Mitigation  Planning 
among  other  things.  However,  DHS  did  not  provide  any  supporting  documentation 
for  us  to  determine  whether  these  controls  and  plans  collectively  constitute  what 
could  be  considered  a  comprehensive  project  plan  for  managing  the  remaining  life 
of the project. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO

ROBERT JACKSTA 

Question  1.  Last  year,  I  successfully  got  included  a  provision  in  the  Intelligence 
Reform bill that applies to cruise ships the same standards that we apply to airlines 
with  respect  to  terror  watch  lists.  My  provision  requires  that  the  Department  of 
Homeland  Security  check  all  passengers  and  crew  manifests  against  the  consoli-
dated  passenger  watch  list  before  they  board  the  ship.  This  is  vital  to  the  security 
of our cruise passengers as well as to the security of our ports and the surrounding 
areas. It will take only one incident to cripple the cruise industry. Similarly one in-
cident, no matter how small, can severely interrupt international commerce. I would 
like  to  know  how  the  implementation  of  this  cruise  ship  watch  list  requirement  is 
progressing. The law gave DHS 180 days to implement this program. We are going 
on  151  days  as  of  today.  Will  DHS  comply  with  this  deadline?  When  can  I  expect 
a briefing on the full implementation of this law? 

Answer.  The  Advanced  Passenger  Information  System  (APIS)  Final  Rule  (70  FR 
17820 April 7, 2005) requires vessel operators to provide passenger APIS. Under the 
Rule,  operators  must  submit  passenger  information  according  to  the  following  cri-
teria:  96  hours  prior  to  arrival  at  a  U.S.  port  for  voyages  over  96  hours;  24  hours 
prior  to  arrival  at  a  U.S.  port  for  voyages  less  than  96  hours;  prior  to  departure 
from  foreign  for  voyages  less  than  24  hours;  and  15  minutes  prior  to  departure  for 
vessels departing the U.S. 

Vessel  Crew  and  Passenger  APIS  manifests  are  vetted  against  law  enforcement 
databases maintained within the TECS/IBIS mainframe and against the anti-terror 
watch  list,  which  is  exported  to  the  TECS/IBIS  mainframe  from  the  Terrorist 
Screening  Center.  In  lieu  of  an  automated  notification  mechanism,  the  CBP  Na-
tional  Targeting  Center  (NTC)  actively  vets  APIS  lists  to  identify  passengers  or 
crew who are arriving or departing aboard commercial sea vessels. The NTC coordi-
nates  the  identification,  interception  and  examination  of  targeted  passengers  with 
the U.S. Coast Guard. 

The  vessel  time  requirements  within  APIS  reflect  Coast  Guard  regulations  and 
were  written  to  establish  continuity  between  agency  reporting  requirements.  Com-
mercial cargo and passenger vessels board passengers and crew several hours in ad-
vance  of  departure.  Due  to  the  extended  time  needed  to  board  a  passenger  vessel

or prepare the vessel to sail, CBP has determined the time requirements published 
within  the  Coast  Guard  regulations  serve  the  purpose  for  targeting  suspect  high-
risk passengers and crew. 

CBP  would  welcome  the  opportunity  to  discuss  the  implementation  of  this  pro-
gram  in  greater  detail.  Please  have  your  staff  contact  Thaddeus  Bingel,  Assistant 
Commissioner  for  Congressional  Affairs  at  (202)  344–1760  to  arrange  a  briefing  on 
the implementation of APIS for passenger vessels.

Question  2.  It  is  crucial  that  we  stop  dangerous  cargo  from  reaching  our  shores 
at  all.  Once  the  cargo  gets  here  our  chances  of  stopping  a  catastrophic  event  are 
greatly reduced. We need to push our borders out and catch dangerous cargo before 
it leaves the home ports. However, odds are high that we will not catch everything. 
So we need to be able to track cargo and know as quickly and efficiently as possible 
if  the  containers  have  been  tampered  with  en  route.  What  technology  is  DHS  look-
ing into to maintain and ensure the integrity of the seals on the containers? 

Answer.  DHS  is  currently  exploring  technology  designed  to  enhance  the  integrity 
and security of oceangoing containers, rather than the seals that are affixed to such 
containers.  The  majority  of  seals  currently  used  by  shippers  and  importers  are  me-
chanical and are not able to interface electronically with the verification process. As 
the technology incorporated into electronic seals (e-seals) is developed and matured, 
it  is  anticipated  that  such  e-seal  capability  could  be  used  to  maintain  the  integrity 
of  not  only  the  seals  but  also  the  containers  to  which  they  are  affixed.  The  Inter-
national  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  is  in  the  process  of  developing  the 
accepted standards for e-seals and their use.

Question 2a. Are GPS tracking systems part of the technology? 
Answer. DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) is working with Customs 
and  Border  Protection  (CBP)  to  identify  and  evaluate  technology  designed  to  en-
hance the security of ocean going containers. Such Advanced Container Security De-
vices (ACSDs) shall be designed to integrate with the Marine Asset Tag and Track-
ing System (MATTS), a tracking and communication system that would provide con-
tainer-tracking capability. This technology has application to assist CBP in tracking 
in-bond shipments and is extensible to rail and truck transport.

Question  2b.  What  are  the  expected  costs  to  the  private  industry  to  employ  any 

new technologies? 

Answer.  Based  upon  current  technical  capabilities  and  rate  of  maturation,  the 
cost to private industry to employ new technology that is presently under evaluation 
is, on an average, no greater than 50 dollars per trip over the projected 10-year av-
erage life of the container. As technology continues to develop and mature, however, 
it is anticipated that such costs would decrease significantly.

Question 2c. What is the time frame for deploying the next generation of container 

seals? 

Answer.  CBP  is  working  in  conjunction  with  DHS/S&T  on  the  development  of 
next generation container security technology. S&T recently issued a Broad Agency 
Announcement for its Advanced Container Security Device Program. This effort will 
result in the issuance of DHS-wide standards for next-generation Container Security 
Devices that provide:

and the port of arrival, and 

• six-sided intrusion detection and alerting, 
• a means for increased visibility of stuffing and transit history, 
• enhanced data and information for the CBP’s National Targeting Center (NTC) 
• timely reporting and communications.
Additionally,  as  a  part  of  the  ACSD  Program,  S&T  has  a  parallel  Research  and 
Development  effort  for  capability  integration  into  the  container,  to  optimally  push 
container security development to the container manufacturers. 

In managing this process, S&T has established an Integrated Process and Product 
Team  (IPPT),  which  includes  representatives  from  DHS,  Department  of  Defense, 
and the Department of Transportation, to ensure a wide voice among federal agency 
stakeholders and to prevent development of a solely S&T solution. 

A  development  period  of  approximately  3  to  5  years  may  be  required  to  produce 
an  operationally  suitable  and  technically  robust  ACSD  solution  fulfilling  the  above 
objectives.  As  an  immediate  step,  CBP  has  launched  the  ‘‘Smart  Box’’  initiative  to 
evaluate the logistical and operational aspects of using container security devices for 
intrusion detection. The Initiative’s near term goal is to approve a device that would 
monitor  and  log  door  activity  for  inclusion  in  CBP  cargo  security  programs.  The 
Smart Box focuses on the testing of ‘‘off the shelf’’ Container Security Devices (CSD) 
to help address the current threat of container tampering en-route.

Question  3.  I  am  very  concerned  about  the  Caribbean  Basin  area  and  port  secu-
rity.  The  safety  and  security  of  ports  in  the  Caribbean  Basin  have  a  direct  impact 
on  Florida  and  the  rest  of  the  Nation.  A  significant  amount  of  trade  goes  back  and 
forth  between  ports  in  Florida  and  Latin  America  and  this  trade  is  only  expected 
to  increase  in  the  coming  years.  It  is  crucial  that  the  seaports  that  are  closest  to 
our  own  borders  are  secured.  This  is  a  particular  challenge  in  this  area  because  of 
the  well-established  drug  trafficking  routes  throughout  Latin  America.  We  need  to 
do  something  to  address  this  issue  and  we  need  to  do  it  now.  We  need  to  ensure 
that goods originating from these ports are safe and secure and do not pose a threat 
to the U.S. One way to do this, as you all at DHS have shown, is through programs 
like  the  Container  Security  Initiative.  Many  don’t  think  about  the  Caribbean  basin 
as  a  real  security  risk.  In  this  week’s  Jane’s  Defense  Weekly,  however,  there  is  an 
article  about  piracy  and  it  maps  the  number  of  acts  of  piracy  by  region.  In  2004, 
there were 14 reported acts of piracy just off the shores of Columbia, Venezuela, and 
Brazil. That is a significant number of incidents. Piracy not only poses an immense 
threat  to  the  safety  of  the  crew  aboard  these  cargo  vessels  but  can  be  an  avenue 
for  terrorists  to  get  to  our  shores  with  deadly  weapons  without  being  detected  and 
without having to go through the normal Customs channels. We cannot forget about 
the  Caribbean  Basin  ports—these  ports  that  are  so  close  to  our  own  shores.  How 
many  and  which  Caribbean  Basin  ports  are  currently  out  of  compliance  with  the 
MTSA regulations or the ISPS Code? 

Answer.  Federal  regulations  to  ensure  the  security  of  domestic  seaports  is  gov-
erned  by  the  Maritime  Transportation  Security  Act  (MTSA)  and  the  International 
Ship  and  Port  Facility  Security  (ISPS)  Code  addresses  the  security  of  international 
seaports. Information regarding specific port compliance with MTSA and ISPS regu-
lations  is  the  responsibility  of  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  (USCG).  It  is  the  practice  of 
USCG  to  advise  CBP  regarding  MTSA  non-compliant  ports.  CBP  incorporates  this 
information into the Advanced Targeting System (ATS); the ATS evaluates the risk 
associated  with  all  U.S.-bound  shipments  to  determine  appropriate  screening  and 
inspection responses. 

CBP  has  long-standing  institutionalized  relationships  with  U.S.  trade  operations, 
such as the Port and Terminal Operators through the Business Anti-Smuggling Co-
alition  (BASC),  in  the  Caribbean  Basin.  BASC  is  endorsed  by  the  World  Customs 
Organization  (WCO)  and  is  active  with  the  Organization  of  American  States  (OAS) 
on  Port  Security  and  Supply-Chain-Security  Initiatives.  Although  BASC  initially 
had  an  anti-narcotics  focus,  terrorism  has  now  been  incorporated  into  their  profile 
and  security  standards.  At  present,  BASC  has  expanded  to  include:  Mexico;  Guate-
mala; Jamaica; Ecuador; Panama; Venezuela; Peru; Uruguay; the Dominican Repub-
lic; Costa Rica; Haiti and El Salvador. In each of these countries, Port and Terminal 
Operations  remain  vital  segments  of  the  supply  chain  that  actively  participate  in 
BASC. 

CBP is exploring further expansion of the Container Security Initiative (CSI) with 
Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean,  namely  in  Argentina  and  in  Brazil,  with  plans 
to  conduct  assessments  in  the  Bahamas,  Colombia,  Jamaica.  Honduras,  and  Pan-
ama.

Question  3a.  What  is  DHS  doing  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  goods  and  containers 
coming into the U.S. via the Caribbean Basin ports other than just penalizing ship-
pers who do not comply with our regulations? 

Answer.  Customs  and  Border  Protection  (CBP)  is  looking  at  expanding  the  Con-
tainer Security Initiative to Central America and South America. In South America, 
CBP  has  signed  Declarations  of  Principle  with  Argentina  (May  9,  2005)  and  Brazil 
(May 24, 2005) to become the first two South American ports to participate in CSI. 
CBP  has  scheduled  a  capacity  assessment  for  Cartagena,  Colombia  for  the  first 
week  in  August  2005.  In  Central  America  and  the  Caribbean  Basin,  CBP  has  com-
pleted  capacity  assessments  in  Puerto  Cortes,  Honduras;  Kingston,  Jamaica;  and 
Freeport,  Bahamas  to  determine  their  viability  in  being  able  to  support  CSI.  CBP 
will  be  scheduling  a  capacity  assessment  of  Colon  and  Balboa,  Panama  in  the  near 
future.  CBP  will  determine  by  these  capacity  assessments  if  any  of  these  ports 
would be able to support a CSI program. 

As part of DHS’s multi-layer cargo security approach, the Science and Technology 
Directorate (S&T), in coordination with Customs and Border Protection (CBP), is de-
veloping  technologies  the  ensure  the  security  of  intermodal  shipping  containers, 
such as the Advanced Container Security Device (ACSD) and the Marine Asset Tag 
and  Tracking  System  (MATTS),  which  will  actively  monitor  the  integrity  and  track 
containers globally.

Question 1. The Port of Seattle in my state is one of the Nation’s largest and most 
diverse  port  complexes.  It  is  a  major  container  and  cruise  ship  port,  home  to  the 
Alaska fishing fleet, supports tens of thousands of ferry riders each day and the city 
is  one  of  the  most  sought-after  tourist  destinations  in  the  world.  The  port  is  also 
located only blocks away from a bustling downtown. Do you believe the Coast Guard 
has enough resources to adequately protect a thriving port city like Seattle? 

Answer.  The  Coast  Guard  does  not  individually  possess  the  resources  to  protect 
an  entire  port  such  as  Seattle,  but  works  in  concert  with  other  federal,  state  and 
local  authorities,  as  well  as  the  port  community,  to  protect  the  port.  Even  so,  risks 
to  any  port  cannot  be  completely  eliminated.  The  Coast  Guard  is  working  with  the 
port community to focus resources on reducing the greatest risks to the port. 

The  Coast  Guard  has  built  a  strong  foundation  of  effectively  working  with  the 
maritime  industry  through  our  historical  enforcement  of  safety  and  environmental 
protection  regulations.  Our  Captain  of  the  Port  activities  and  local  enforcement  of 
regulations  resulted  in  many  well  established  relationships  in  the  port  community, 
and many venues in which to engage local stakeholders such as Port Security Com-
mittees,  Port  Readiness  Committees,  Harbor  Safety  Committees  and  OPA  90  Area 
Committees. 

The Coast Guard also implemented regulations from the Maritime Transportation 
Security  Act  (MTSA)  of  2002  on  July  1,  2004.  These  regulations  require,  among 
other things that industry have in place vessel and facility security plans, which are 
tested  and  approved  in  accordance  with  established  Coast  Guard  standards.  These 
efforts  have  been  enhanced  through  Congress’s  funding  of  791  FTP  in  the  2005 
budget for nationwide MTSA implementation. 

Since  9/11,  the  Coast  Guard  has  also  created  or  acquired  new  or  enhanced  Mari-

time Homeland Security Capabilities including:

• 12 Maritime Safety and Security Teams. 
• 15 Additional Coastal Patrol Boats. 
• 80+ new Response Boats.
• The  Navy  has  agreed  to  transfer  five  Patrol  Coastal  boats  (PC–170s)  to  the 
Coast Guard this FY05. The Navy has agreed to continue most maintenance re-
sponsibilities on these Patrol Coastal boats for four years (through FY08).

ways,  while  continuing  to  facilitate  the  flow  of  commerce.  The  improvements  in 
Ports,  Waterways  and  Coastal  Security  (PWCS)  that  are  currently  evident  are,  in 
large part, attributable to the passing of the watershed Maritime Transportation Se-

security  posture  of  the  Nation’s  maritime  critical  infrastructure  and  key  assets 
(MCI/KA)  and  the  overall  preparedness  of  federal,  state,  local  and  private  security 
forces. The Coast Guard is committed to a course that improves our maritime secu-
rity  with  the  ultimate  goal  of  preventing  the  exploitation  of,  or  terrorist  attacks 
within,  the  U.S.  Maritime  Domain.  Doing  so  requires  a  threat-based,  risk-managed 
approach to identify and intercept threats before they reach U.S. shores. The Coast 
Guard  accomplishes  this  by  conducting  layered,  multi-agency  security  operations 
while strengthening the security posture and reducing the vulnerability of MCI/KA, 
with  an  increased  focus  on  the  Nation’s  most  militarily  and  economically  critical 
ports.  As  the  Coast  Guard  seeks  to  reduce  maritime  risk,  it  must  strive  to  balance 
its  PWCS  mission  requirements  with  other  Coast  Guard  non-security  missions  to 
ensure  no  degradation  in  those  missions.  The  Coast  Guard  must  exercise  its  full 
suite  of  authorities,  capabilities,  competencies,  and  partnerships  to  accomplish  its 
full spectrum of missions in the post-9/11 world. 

The  Coast  Guard  is  continuing  to  meet  the  challenges  of  our  legacy  missions  in 
the  Puget  Sound  region,  as  well  as  meeting  the  new  challenges  presented  by  our 
integration  into  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  and  new  homeland  security 
mandates. Implementation of expanded security responsibilities is being built on the 
foundation  provided  by  our  existing  marine  safety,  port  security  and  maritime  law 
enforcement  missions,  and  broadens  our  efforts  to  reduce  risks  in  the  U.S.  Marine 
Transportation  System  and  to  enforce  laws  and  treaties.  Although  much  work  re-
mains, we are progressively improving maritime homeland security. 

The diversity of Puget Sound’s maritime industry presents unique challenges that 
require daily cooperation between industry and government to balance the needs of 
commerce  with  those  of  homeland  security.  The  security  net  vital  to  limiting 
vulnerabilities in Puget Sound ports consists of layered security measures that rely 
on the successful implementation of the MTSA and the International Ship and Port 
Facility  Security  (ISPS)  Code.  Implementation  of  MTSA  and  the  ISPS  Code  were 
major  activities  during  2004.  Security  measures  are  in  place  for  domestic  and  for-
eign  vessels,  domestic  waterfront  facilities  and  Puget  Sound  as  a  whole.  We  also 
maintain  a  Maritime  Safety  and  Security  Team  (MSST)  in  Seattle.  It  was  the  first 
MSST established, and provides an expanded capability for port safety and security 
operations. 

One of the foundations for improving maritime security is the Area Maritime Se-
curity  Committee  (AMSC)  required  by  MTSA  regulations.  Facilitated  by  the  U.S. 
Coast Guard, the Puget Sound AMSC consolidated existing port security committees 
and  a  committee  that  had  been  formed  to  represent  Washington  State  Ferries  and 
their unique concerns. The AMSC has established communications links across law 
enforcement  and  emergency  response  entities,  identified  public  and  private  sector 
capabilities  and  responsibilities,  and  established  a  regular  schedule  of  meetings, 
training  and  exercises  to  foster  maintenance  and  continuous  improvement  of  secu-
rity measures in place to protect the port. 

The AMSC is coordinating all federal, state, local and private sector maritime se-
curity  efforts  in  Puget  Sound.  The  25-person  AMSC  encompasses  a  wealth  of  mari-
time  knowledge,  and  draws  talents  from  all  aspects  of  industry,  police  and  fire  de-
partments  and  from  components  of  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security.  Collec-
tively,  they  advise  the  Federal  Maritime  Security  Coordinator  on  security  concerns 
and critical commercial interests unique to Puget Sound. We continue to build upon 
these efforts to provide rigorous maritime security for the Puget Sound region.

Question 2. There is talk about imposing fees on imports to cover the cost of port 
security.  My  concern  is  that  some  import  ports  are  located  near  Canada  or  Mexico 
where  infrastructure  is  either  developed  or  being  developed  to  compete  with  the 
U.S.  ports  for  import  goods.  I  am  concerned  that  any  fee  will  simply  drive  import 
goods  to  these  other  countries,  especially  Canada,  which  has  a  well-developed  ship-
ping  and  rail  infrastructure.  Once  the  cargo  is  diverted,  it  will  enter  the  U.S.,  pos-
sibly  by  rail,  and  not  receive  all  the  protections  it  may  have  been  subject  to  had 
it  come  through  a  U.S.  gateway.  This  obviously  undermines  our  security  and  our 
economic  mission.  In  addition,  as  our  economy  in  the  Pacific  Northwest  finally  is 
overcoming years of recession, this is not the time to cause important port business 
to be diverted to Canada. How do you purpose to address a scenario where U.S. se-
curity  fees  might  send  U.S.-bound  import  goods  to  these  other  countries  causing 
them to receive less security scrutiny? 

Answer.  CBP  does  not  propose  to  add  any  additional  fees  for  security  or  regular 

cargo exams.

Question 3. There has been talk since shortly after 9/11 about requiring shipping 
containers from overseas to be equipped with mechanisms that verify that they were 
securely  loaded  and  not  tampered  with  before  reaching  U.S.  shores.  My  colleague

87

and  friend,  Senator  Murray  has  implemented  pilot  programs  to  determine  the  best 
technology to accomplish this. What needs to be done to ensure these containers are 
safe before entering the U.S.? 

Answer. Container security is multi layered and cross-functional and requires the 
commitment  and  resources  of  not  only  the  U.S.  Government  but  also  the  importing 
community.  The  addition  of  technology  designed  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  con-
tainers  bound  for  U.S.  shores  is  but  one  facet  in  securing  containers.  Such  tech-
nology  must  work  in  conjunction  with  mechanical  seals  and  sealing  processes  to  be 
utilized  at  the  point  of  stuffing  through  trusted,  vetted  partners  such  as  the  C–
TPAT members. 

Manifest data provided by the shippers and importers are a critical component to 
this  layered  approach  in  order  to  conduct  targeting  of  potentially  high-risk  con-
tainers. The Container Security Initiative (CSI) provides an additional layer as such 
targeting  is  conducted  at  overseas  locations  prior  to  containers  being  laden  aboard 
U.S. bound vessels. 

The  use  of  Non-Intrusive  Inspectional  (NII)  equipment,  such  as  large-scale  non-
intrusive inspection imaging technology and radiation portal monitors is also critical 
to  both  ensuring  the  integrity  of  containers  as  well  as  in  expediting  the  inspection 
and movement of legitimate freight.

Question 3a. What more can be done in this regard and what specifically does the 
CG,  or  other  branches  of  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security,  have  planned  in 
this regard? 

Answer.  The  Coast  Guard  is  an  active  participant  in  Operation  Safe  Commerce. 
which is a DHS grant program testing a host of technology solutions for intermodal 
container security in the international supply chain. The Coast Guard is a member 
of the Executive Steering Committee for that project. The results of Operation Safe 
Commerce  will  help  determine  which  technologies  are  mature  enough  to  be  consid-
ered for mandatory use on containers bound for the United States. 

The  Coast  Guard  is  also  working  closely  with  Customs  and  Border  Protection  on 
the  development  of  a  proposed  rule  that  would  require  the  mandatory  use  of  high 
security  mechanical  seals  on  containers  bound  for  the  United  States.  The  rule  is 
being  drafted  to  allow  the  introduction  of  advanced  technology  to  be  incorporated 
with the mechanical seals as those technologies develop. 

The  Coast  Guard  is  a  member  of  the  Container  Security  Integrated  Product  and 
Process Team (IPPT), co-led by the Science & Technology Directorate (S&T) and the 
Border and Transportation Security (BTS) Policy & Planning Office, which provides 
oversight to the development and evaluation of advanced technologies for intermodal 
shipping  containers,  such  as  the  Advanced  Container  Security  Device  (ACSD),  and 
for the development of the Container Security Systems Architecture.

Question  4.  In  your  testimony  to  the  House  Transportation  Subcommittee  on 
Coast  Guard  and  Marine  Transportation  on  June  4,  2004,  you  had  stated  that  all 
Area  Maritime  Security  Plans  were  approved  by  June  1,  2004  and  they  would  be 
fully implemented on or before July 1, 2004. Has this happened? If not, what is the 
current status of implementation and how many plans have yet to be approved? 

Answer.  Yes,  all  of  the  Area  Maritime  Security  Plans  have  been  completed,  ap-

proved and implemented.

Question  5.  At  the  time  of  the  testimony  you  provided  to  the  House  Transpor-
tation Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation on June 4, 2004, 
the Coast Guard had completed Port Security Assessments at 19 of the 55 most sig-
nificant  military  and  economic  ports  in  the  U.S.  Today  you  state  that  all  55  have 
been  completed.  Can  you  please  provide  a  list  of  any  Washington  State  ports  that 
were included in this figure and any other information as it relates to their respec-
tive assessments? 

Answer.  Port  Security  Assessments  (PSAs)  have  been  conducted  in  Seattle,  Ta-
coma  and  Vancouver,  Washington.  These  PSAs  included  waterway  assessments  of 
Puget Sound, Elliott Bay, Blair Waterway, Rich Passage, Budd Inlet and the Colum-
bia  River.  In  these  areas  16  facilities  and  vessels  were  assessed  from  a  Terrorist 
Operations  Perspective,  identifying  vulnerabilities  and  recommending  mitigating 
strategies.  The  assets  visited  included  cruise  ships,  passenger  ferry  terminals  and 
vessels,  oil  terminals,  chemical  terminals,  bulk  cargo  terminals,  locks  and  bridges. 
The results of the assessment are categorized as Sensitive Security Information and 
not  public  record  information.  However,  the  information  is  appropriately  shared 
with  those  that  have  a  need  to  know  in  law  enforcement  agencies,  select  members 
of the port’s Area Maritime Security Committee and each individual owner/operator 
of the facility or vessel.

Question  6.  In  your  testimony  to  the  House  Transportation  Subcommittee  on 
Coast  Guard  and  Maritime  Transportation  on  June  4,  2004,  you  state  that,  ‘‘In  im-

plementing  the  Maritime  Transportation  Security  Act  (MTSA),  the  Coast  Guard 
identified  approximately  3,200  marine  facilities  that  could  be  involved  in  a  Trans-
portation Security Incident. Nearly all of these facilities have since conducted a self-
assessment and submitted a facility security plan to the Coast Guard for approval.’’ 
Has  the  Coast  Guard  completed  review  of  the  remaining  facility  security  plans?  If 
not,  how  many  have  yet  to  submit  a  facility  security  plan  to  the  Coast  Guard  for 
approval? 

Answer.  All  required  facility  security  plans  were  approved  by  the  target  date  of 
December  31,  2004.  After  a  detailed  review  for  content  at  the  National  Facility  Se-
curity  Plan  Review  Center  (NFSPRC),  local  Coast  Guard  Captains  of  the  Port 
(COTPs) approved the plans individually following compliance verification examina-
tions  of  each  applicable  facility.  In  all,  approximately  3,200  facility  security  plans 
were reviewed and coordinated by the Coast Guard’s NFSPRC.

Question  7.  What  is  the  status  of  the  Coast  Guard’s  schedule  to  have  Automatic 
Identification  System  (AIS)  capabilities  at  each  Vessel  Traffic  Service  and  when  do 
you  think  that  this  long-term  goal  of  nationwide  AIS  coverage  will  be  completed? 
Answer. The Coast Guard has installed the Automatic Identification System (AIS) 
in  all  Coast  Guard  Vessel  Traffic  Services  (VTS)  as  of  November  2004.  This  capa-
bility  provides  AIS  coverage  within  each  VTS’  area  of  responsibility.  The  Coast 
Guard has also a chartered Major Systems Acquisition project to establish a nation-
wide AIS surveillance network to support all Coast Guard missions. Eventually, the 
entire  coastline,  the  Great  Lakes  and  the  Western  Rivers  will  be  covered  by  AIS 
under  this  project.  The  current  schedule  calls  for  nationwide  AIS  coverage  to  be 
fully complete in 2010.

Question 8. As you know, ensuring the security of our Maritime domain is a criti-
cally important component of our economy. Securing the Maritime domain is an ef-
fort that must be orchestrated with each and every one of our Nation’s trading part-
ners.  We  must  be  assured  of  the  contents  and  security  of  shipments  as  they  leave 
foreign  ports  destined  for  the  U.S.  In  your  testimony,  you  state  that  the  Coast 
Guard  continues  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  antiterrorism  measures  and  imple-
mentation  of  the  International  Ship  and  Port  Facility  Security  code  requirements. 
You  state  that  ‘‘10  countries  are  scheduled  for  visits  by  June  2005  with  the  goal  of 
visiting  all  of  our  approximately  140  maritime  trading  partners.’’  Which  countries 
are  included  in  the  list  of  10  to  be  visited  by  June  2005?  When  does  the  Coast 
Guard  estimate  that  an  assessment  will  be  conducted  on  all  140  maritime  trading 
partners? 

Answer. As of July 2005 the Coast Guard has visited 29 countries including: Alge-
ria, Argentina, Australia, Bahamas, Chile, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, 
Equatorial  Guinea,  Gabon,  Guatemala,  Honduras,  Hong  Kong,  India,  Jamaica, 
Japan,  Mexico,  New  Zealand,  Panama,  Peru,  Philippines,  Singapore,  South  Korea, 
Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Uruguay and Venezuela. 

The  Coast  Guard  estimates  that  an  assessment  will  have  been  conducted  on  all 

140 maritime trading partners by December 2007.

Question  9.  As  you  know,  the  Transportation  Workers  Identification  Card  has 
played an important role in port security by enhancing identity verification. In your 
testimony you state that the Coast Guard is working with the Transportation Secu-
rity  Administration  (TSA)  to  develop  new  credentialing  for  Merchant  Mariners. 
What is the current status of this effort? 

Answer.  The  Coast  Guard  continues  to  update  the  merchant  mariner 
credentialing statutes, which include provisions that will allow the future harmoni-
zation  of  mariners’  credentials  and  TWIC.  The  Coast  Guard  is  not  developing  en-
tirely new credentials for mariners, but will continue to build upon existing security 
features that have already been incorporated into mariners’ credentials until full in-
tegration  with  the  TWIC  is  achieved.  The  Coast  Guard  is  currently  in  the  final 
stages  of  drafting  a  Legislative  Change  Proposal  (LCP)  that  will  accomplish  many 
of the needed updates to its merchant mariner document statutes and is also work-
ing  closely  with  TSA  to  ensure  the  efficient  and  effective  integration  of  the  TWIC 
and  mariners’  credentials.  The  two  efforts,  though  related,  are  progressing  under 
different timelines. The LCP is solely a Coast Guard effort and expected to be pub-
lished  in  early  2006.  TSA  is  the  lead  agency  on  the  TWIC  effort,  with  the  Coast 
Guard providing assistance.

Question  9a.  In  what  capacity  is  the  Coast  Guard  assisting  the  TSA  to  develop 

a new identification system for merchant mariners? 

Answer. The Coast Guard has partnered with TSA to develop and implement the 
Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC)  in  the  maritime  mode, 
which  will  satisfy  the  mandate  of  46  U.S.C.  70105,  requiring  that  certain  mariners 
carry  a  biometrically  enhanced  ‘‘transportation  security  card.’’  The  TWIC  will  build

89

upon and integrate with the current mariners credentialing system rather than im-
plement  an  entirely  new  identification  system.  The  National  Maritime  Center 
(NMC) is fully involved in advising TSA of mariner credentialing requirements and 
existing  Coast  Guard  processes,  and  is  leading  the  effort  to  ensure  that  the  MMD 
process is integrated into the TWIC process to the fullest appropriate degree.
Question 9b. What role can this Committee play to assist in this endeavor? 
Answer.  The  Committee’s  oversight  will  continue  to  be  very  important.  The  task 
of  creating  a  uniform,  biometrically  enabled  credential  that  is  to  be  implemented 
across  all  transportation  modes  is  a  hugely  complex  endeavor  that  requires  consid-
ered,  careful  planning  to  effectively  implement.  While  the  Coast  Guard  is  involved 
in  implementation  of  the  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC) 
within the maritime mode only, almost every mode of transportation other than the 
airlines, will be impacted to some degree in its rulemaking. To ensure that the rule 
which  results  is  intelligent  and  effective,  the  Coast  Guard  is  careful  to  rely  upon 
experts  in  the  field  who  fully  understand  the  intricacies  of  implementing  for  the 
first time this type of technology at the proposed scale. While thoughtful, measured 
regulations  will  achieve  significant  improvements  in  the  security  of  our  ports,  a 
rushed implementation is unlikely to achieve any significant security enhancements, 
and  could  potentially  wreak  havoc  with  the  Nation’s  economy  while  placing  un-
founded burdens upon workers, employers and the Federal Government.

Question  9c.  What  timeline,  if  any,  has  been  established  for  completion  of  a  new 

identification system for merchant mariners? 

Answer.  The  merchant  mariner  identification  system  and  supporting  statutes 
were designed in a far different threat environment than today. As such, the Coast 
Guard  is  examining  the  full  scope  of  necessary  changes  to  the  identification  docu-
ments and requirements in order to modernize the system, as well as to put in place 
appropriate safeguards. Some of these changes will no doubt require legislative pro-
posals.  The  Coast  Guard  is  in  the  final  stages  of  examining  those  needs  now  and 
any needed legislative changes will be proposed by the Administration in the course 
of the 2007 authorization cycle.

Question  10.  In  your  testimony,  you  state  that  the  Coast  Guard  is  continually 
looking for ways to improve its ability to respond to suspect activities by increasing 
Coast Guard operational presence in our maritime domain and improving the Coast 
Guard’s capacities for response and recovery. The Coast Guard’s responsibility to de-
fend and secure 26,000 miles of navigable waterways and 361ports is a challenging 
task.  What  are  some  initiatives  that  the  Coast  Guard  is  considering  to  expand  its 
operation presence and enhance its ability to respond to a terrorist incident? 

Answer. Coast Guard efforts to increase operational presence in ports and coastal 
zones focus not only on adding more people, boats and ships to force structures, but 
also on making the employment of those resources more effective through the appli-
cation  of  technology,  information  sharing  and  intelligence  support.  Since  9/11,  we 
have:

• Established 13 new Maritime Safety and Security Teams, 
• Deployed over 100 new small boats and boat crews, 
• Provided radiation detection capabilities to many of our boarding teams,
• Deployed field intelligence support teams to better collect and disseminate mari-
• Acquired  fifteen  87-foot  Coastal  Patrol  boats  and  four  179-foot  coastal  patrol 

time threat information,

craft to increase operational presence in our ports.

The  FY  2006  budget  focuses  resources  toward  increasing  both  the  quantity  and 

quality of Coast Guard operational presence by providing funding for:

• Integrated Deepwater System—Continued investment in Deepwater will greatly 
improve  the  Coast  Guard’s  maritime  presence  starting  at  America’s  ports,  wa-
terways, and coasts and extending seaward to wherever the Coast Guard needs 
to  be  present  or  to  take  appropriate  maritime  action.  Deepwater  provides  the 
capability  to  identify,  interdict,  board  and,  where  warranted,  seize  vessels  or 
people  engaged  in  illegal  or  terrorist  activity  at  sea  or  on  the  ports,  waterways 
or coast of America.
• Airborne Use of Force (AUF) capability—deploys organic AUF capability to five 
Coast Guard Air Stations, increasing the ability to respond to maritime security 
threats.
• Enhanced  Cutter  Boat  Capability—replaces  existing  obsolete  and  unstable  cut-
ter boats throughout the entire WHEC/WMEC fleet with the more capable Cut-
ter  Boat—Over  the  Horizon  and  replaces  aging,  unsafe  boat  davit  systems  on 
210-foot WMECs.

• Increase  Port  Presence  and  Liquefied  Natural  Gas  (LNG)  Transport  Security—
provides additional Response Boat-Smalls and associated crews to increase pres-
ence  to  patrol  critical  infrastructure  areas,  enforce  security  zones,  and  perform 
high  interest  vessel  escorts  in  strategic  ports  throughout  the  Nation.  Provides 
additional  boat  crews  and  screening  personnel  at  key  LNG  hubs  such  as  Cove 
Point,  MD  and  Providence,  RI  to  enhance  LNG  tanker  and  waterside  security.
• Enhanced  Maritime  Safety  and  Security  Team  (E–MSST)—Reallocates  existing 
Coast Guard resources to immediately fill an existing gap in national maritime 
Law  Enforcement  and  Counter-Terrorism  (LE/CT)  capability.  Full  operation  of 
E–MSST  Chesapeake,  VA  will  provide  an  offensive  DHS  force  able  to  execute 
across the full spectrum of LE and CT response in support of homeland security 
and homeland defense objectives, including CT response capability for scheduled 
security events out to 50 nautical miles from shore and augments to interagency 
assets  in  high  visibility  venues  such  as  National  Special  Security  Events 
(NSSEs).

Question 10a. Has Congress provided the Coast Guard with the resources it needs 

to meet its current mandates, including those set forth in the MTSA? 

Answer.  The  FY  2005  Budget  provided  approximately  $101  million  and  791  per-
sonnel to support the implementation of MTSA. This support has been instrumental 
to  executing  the  implementation  of  MTSA  requirements  and  sustaining  its  ongoing 
enforcement.  Much  has  been  done  to  enhance  port  security  and  while  more  clearly 
remains to be done, the Coast Guard will continue to work with the Administration 
and Congress to pursue additional resources as needed to mitigate the highest mari-
time risks.

Question 10b. What additional resources can Congress provide that are necessary 

to allow for the enhancements that you reference? 

Answer.  The  FY  2006  budget  request,  now  before  the  Congress,  represents  the 
highest  priority  needs  of  the  Coast  Guard.  Fully  supporting  the  President’s  request 
for  FY  2006  will  make  significant  enhancements  to  Coast  Guard  capability  and 
readiness. As for additional resources, the next highest unfunded priorities are rep-
resented  in  our  FY  2006  Unfunded  Priorities  list  that  was  provided  to  Congress  on 
February 25, 2005, and a copy of which is attached.

Question  11.  As  you  state  in  your  testimony.  ‘‘Cargo  security  encompasses  the 
process of ensuring that all cargo bound for the U.S. is legitimate and was properly 
supervised  from  the  point  of  origin,  through  its  sea  transit,  and  during  its  arrival 
at  the  final  destination  in  the  U.S.’’  However,  it  is  clear  that  the  supervision  and 
checking  of  cargo  arriving  at  U.S.  ports  is  woefully  inadequate.  I  understand  that 
as  little  as  5  percent  of  cargo  arriving  at  our  ports  is  checked.  While  the  Coast 
Guard  works  with  Customs  and  Border  Protection  (CBP)  to  provide  oversight  and 
check cargo arriving at our ports, can you provide this Committee an update on the 
varying  levels  of  screening  being  conducted  to  ensure  the  safety  of  these  cargos  as 
well as an update on current efforts to increase screening of cargo? 

Answer.  CBP  meets  its  goal  of  inspecting  100  percent  of  high-risk  people  and 
cargo,  while  allowing  legitimate  commerce  and  passengers  to  proceed  unimpeded, 
through  effective  risk  management  and  its  Cargo  Security  Strategy.  Approximately 
10  million  sea  containers  and  11  million  trucks  arrive  in  the  United  States  annu-
ally;  inspection  of  every  vehicle  would  likely  damage  the  U.S.  economy  and  would 
be counterproductive to CBP’s dual mission of securing the borders while facilitating 
trade. Because the vast majority of shipments are low-risk, CBP must use risk man-
agement  techniques  to  identify  and  screen  the  relatively  few  high-risk  shipments. 
Rather  than  simply  increasing  the  percentage  of  random  inspections,  CBP  em-
ploys  a  layered  cargo  security  strategy  that  is  built  on  five  interrelated  initiatives. 
First, under the 24-Hour Rule, all containers bound for the U.S. are required to sub-
mit manifest data to CBP 24 hours before lading at the foreign port. Next, the Na-
tional  Targeting  Center  (NTC)  provides  CBP  with  tactical  targeting  capability  for 
all  oceangoing  cargo  and  cargo  shipped  by  all  other  transportation  modes  24  hours 
a  day,  seven  days  a  week.  The  NTC  uses  manifest  information  provided  by  the  24-
Hour  Rule  and  will  eventually  include  data  from  Advanced  Container  Security  De-
vices  to  perform  its  targeting  functions.  Additionally,  screening  with  Non-Intrusive 
Inspection (NII) technology, including some physical exams, is required for all high-
risk sea containers and other cargo conveyances arriving in the U.S. NII technology 
is  a  critical  component  of  CBP’s  Cargo  Security  Strategy  aimed  at  preventing  ter-
rorist  groups  from  smuggling  a  Weapon  of  Mass  Effect  or  its  components  into  the 
United  States.  Under  the  Container  Security  Initiative  (CSI),  cargo  security  is 
pushed beyond the borders of the United States. Currently, there are 38 operational

high-risk  containers.  While  examinations  are  conducted  by  CBP’s  host  nation  coun-
terparts, the CBP teams have the ability to observe these exams. 

Additionally,  Automated  Targeting  Systems  (ATS)  at  CSI  ports  are  linked  to  the 
NTC  to  immediately  identify  any  high-risk  containers  bound  for  the  United  States. 
Finally,  under  the  Customs-Trade  Partnership  Against  Terrorism  (C–TPAT),  CBP 
has established partnerships with the private sector to implement minimum stand-
ardized  security  requirements  and  concepts  throughout  the  entire  supply  chain, 
back to and including the foreign manufacturer’s loading docks. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO

REAR ADMIRAL HERETH 

Question  1.  In  the  Coast  Guard’s  report  to  the  Commerce  Committee  on  imple-
mentation  of  Joint  Operation  Command  Centers,  you  failed  to  discuss  any  common 
standards,  best  practices  or  lessons  learned  from  any  of  the  existing  command  cen-
ters  and  how  those  standards  can  be  used  to  develop  additional  units  throughout 
the  country  in  strategic  ports.  Rather,  the  report  discussed  the  Coast  Guard’s  cur-
rent development of Sector Command Centers that are part of the Departmental di-
rective  to  co-locate  the  regulatory  and  operational  assets  into  one  location  for  all  of 
the Coast Guard’s missions with the capability to expand and work with other agen-
cies should an incident occur. I would contest approaching port security from a reac-
tionary  perspective  is  not  in  the  best  interests  of  national  security.  And  further,  in 
meetings I have had with the Commandant. he has described a very different vision 
than  what  is  contained  in  this  report.  What  does  the  Coast  Guard  hope  to  achieve 
with the further development of Joint Operation Command Centers? 

Answer.  Our  primary  goal  is  to  enable  our  federal,  state  and  local  forces  to  be 
more proactive. The limited sensor and coordination capability present in most ports 
must be improved to make that happen. 

We will greatly enhance the ability to be proactive by:
• Developing  a  robust  Common  Operational  Picture  that  will  be  fed  by  sensors 
(cameras,  radars,  etc.)  placed  according  to  a  risk-based  methodology  that  en-
sures surveillance of critical infrastructure and waterways.
• Sharing the Common Operational Picture with port partners by providing them 
a view via a web client service or, if they wish, by including their personnel as 
a permanent or ad hoc part of the command center staff.
• Coordinating federal, state and local enforcement efforts by developing and im-
plementing technologies to track all assets, providing 7×24 monitored maritime 
communications capability and leading regular, collaborative planning and exe-
cution efforts.

Question  2.  MTSA  required  the  Coast  Guard  to  develop  a  National  Maritime 
Transportation Security Plan (46 U.S.C. 70103) to assign duties and responsibilities 
among federal agencies, establish procedures to prevent an incident from occurring, 
and plan for ensuring the flow of commerce is resumed as quickly as possible in the 
event  of  an  attack.  When  will  the  National  Plan  be  completed  and  made  available 
for comment for our maritime stakeholders? 

Answer.  The  review  draft  of  the  National  Plan  is  being  edited  to  prepare  for  dis-
tribution  for  initial  review  by  federal  agency  stakeholders,  which  is  expected  to 
begin in mid-August. The Commandant intends to use the National Maritime Secu-
rity  Advisory  Committee  as  one  of  the  primary  forums  for  comment  on  the  plan  by 
stakeholders  in  the  maritime  industry.  The  schedule  of  availability  for  other  mari-
time stakeholders must be established in consultation with cognizant authorities in 
the office of the Secretary of Homeland Security.

HSPD–13. 

Question 2a. Will this serve as the basis for the President’s National Maritime Se-
curity  Strategy  requirement  in  HSPD  13,  due  to  be  released  in  June  of  this  year? 
Answer. No, but the National Plan has linkages to certain plans developed under 

In accordance with the MTSA, the National Plan is focused on ensuring the secu-
rity  of  assets  and  infrastructure  in  the  Maritime  Homeland  domain  of  the  United 
States.  In  addition  to  fulfilling  the  requirements  of  MTSA,  the  National  Plan  will 
also serve as the sub-sector plan for national maritime transportation security, with-
in  the  family  of  17  sector  security  plans  established  under  HSPD–7,  including  the 
Transportation Sector Security Plan (TSSP). 

In contrast to the MTSA and HSPD–7, HSPD–13 is universal in scope, extending 
completely across both the international and homeland maritime domains. The Na-
tional  Plan  under  MTSA  has  natural  linkages  and  relationships  with  certain  plans

ROBERT JACKSTA 

Question  1.  What  are  the  ‘‘minimum-security  standards’’  the  bureau  has  put  into 

place for the C–TPAT program? 

Answer.  The  minimum-security  criteria  for  C–TPAT  Importers,  promulgated  in 
March 2005 is based on a program assessment of the processes, procedures and best 
practices  extrapolated  from  CBP’s  review  of  security  profile  submissions  and  C–
TPAT  validation  visits.  The  security  criteria  provide  an  effective  benchmark  for  C–
TPAT  companies  to  continue  to  build  upon  their  security  processes  and  procedures 
and  focus  on  foreign  manufacturers  and  container  point  of  stuffing,  through  the 
CBP  clearance  process.  The  security  criteria  provide  a  meaningful  expectation  of 
what is required to enroll in the C–TPAT program.

Question 2. How many RPM’s have been deployed at seaports? 
Answer.  As  of  July  27,  2005,  CBP  has  deployed  88  radiation  portal  monitors  to 

our Nation’s seaports.

Question  3.  I  understand  you  are  proposing  regulations  on  cargo  locks  and  seals 
this summer to satisfy the requirements of MTSA. What requirements are you pro-
posing  in  your  regulations  for  the  domestic  and  international  verification  of  cargo 
seals? 

Answer.  At  the  request  of  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security,  the  Depart-
mental Advisory Committee on Commercial Operations of Customs and Border Pro-
tection and Related Activities (COAC) established a subcommittee to provide advice 
on this issue. Specifically, DHS requested recommendation in three areas: standards 
for physical security for inter-modal containers; secure system of transportation; and 
quantitative performance metrics to measure the success of specific DHS cargo secu-
rity  programs  and  to  guide  future  efforts.  In  response  to  this  request,  COAC  rec-
ommended a regulatory requirement for the sealing of loaded containers. 

DHS  has  reviewed  the  COAC  recommendations  and  agreed  that  there  is  a  need 
for a seal regulation. CBP has drafted the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) 
which  will  require  the  sealing  of  loaded  containers  being  transported  by  vessel  to 
the  United  States.  At  a  minimum  ISO-compliant  high  security  seals  (ISO/PAS 
17712) must be affixed to the container at the last point where the container is load-
ed. Electronically readable mechanical seals and seals that perform other functions, 
such  as  electronic  seals  (e-seals),  may  also  be  used  if  they  meet  or  exceed  the  high 
security  specifications  in  ISO/PAS  17712  or  are  accompanied  by  a  mechanical  seal 
meeting  or  exceeding  the  ISO/PAS  17712  high  security  seal  specifications. 
Verification  of  this  sealing  requirement  must  be  performed  by  the  carrier  or  their 
agent  prior  to  lading  on  a  vessel  departing  for  the  United  States.  The  Department 
is currently reviewing the draft NPRM.

Question  3a.  Aren’t  you  aware  that  Coast  Guard  regulations  require  facilities  to 
routinely  check  seals  for  evidence  of  tampering?  (CFR  105.265)  How  is  this  being 
enforced? 

Answer. Coast Guard enforces 33 CFR 105.265 during periodic and random cargo 
facility  exams.  As  noted,  33  CFR  105.265(b)(1)  requires  facilities  to  routinely  check 
cargo, cargo transport units and cargo storage areas within the facility prior to, and 
during,  cargo  handling  operations  for  evidence  of  tampering.  33  CFR  105.265(b)(4) 
requires  facilities  to  check  seals  and  other  methods  used  to  prevent  tampering  of 
cargo entering the facility and during storage within the facility. 

Operational  MTSA  facilities  are  required  to  hold  Coast  Guard  approved  Facility 
Security  Plans.  Each  facility’s  plan  explains  the  measures  and  procedures  that  the 
company  uses  to  comply  with  the  specific  MTSA  regulations.  In  general,  facilities 
check  cargo,  transport  units  and  loaded  containers  with  a  combination  of  random 
visual and physical examinations, employment of scanning/detection equipment, me-
chanical  devices  and  dogs.  Per  the  regulations,  the  security  measures  are  scalable, 
and  they  must  increase  in  frequency  and  intensity  when  the  Maritime  Security 
(MARSEC) Condition is raised. 

Coast Guard facility inspectors verify that each facility is conducting the security 
measures  as  specified  in  its  Facility  Security  Plan.  This  is  especially  important 
when  the  MARSEC  Condition  is  raised,  and  Coast  Guard  inspectors  perform  spot-
checks to verify the enhanced measures are in place.

Question  4.  What  percentage  of  entry  data  is  received  24  hours  prior  to  loading 
in a foreign port for evaluation and screening by the Automated Targeting System? 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  11:29 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025728 PO 00000 Frm 00096 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\25728.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

Answer.  Currently,  CBP  receives  trade  data  via  manifest  and  entry  filings.  This 
data  is  essential  for  basic  risk  management  and  trade  facilitation.  However,  a  sig-
nificant  amount  of  additional  information  can  be  gathered  during  other  phases  of 
supply chain operations. New sources and types of data can be used to enhance and 
strengthen  the  effectiveness  of  CBP  screening  and  targeting  efforts.  Some  of  these 
points in supply chain operations where data can be gathered include the purchase 
order  process,  staging  and  shipment,  and  cargo  transportation.  By  collecting  more 
and  different  information  throughout  the  supply  chain,  greater  visibility  and  trans-
parency  can  be  achieved  and  true  risk  better  understood  within  the  international 
supply chain. 

The CBP Advance Trade Data Initiative (ATDI) is currently a prototype program 
researching  and  analyzing  data  available  in  today’s  global  supply  chains.  ATDI 
seeks  to  enhance  CBP’s  risk  management  practices  through  earlier  collection  and 
analysis  of  business-to-business  information  used  by  commercial  supply  chain  par-
ticipants. This information is available in advance of and in addition to the manifest 
and  entry  data  currently  collected  by  CBP.  ATDI  is  a  fact-finding  prototype  that 
seeks to gain greater visibility into supply-chain-security. 

The ATDI prototype has been developed with significant participation from mem-
bers  of  the  trade  community.  A  supply-chain-security  committee  has  been  set  up 
within the Trade Support Network as a forum that works with the trade community 
to  identify  and  leverage  advance  information  early  in  the  supply  chain.  This  ad-
vance  information  will  build  upon  existing  CBP  security  measures  to  add  value  to 
ongoing  targeting  initiatives  in  order  to  secure  our  Nations  borders,  as  well  as  our 
efforts to facilitate legitimate trade. The committee’s goal is to identify, discuss, doc-
ument,  and  submit  the  trade  communities’  supply-chain-security  requirement  rec-
ommendations for CBP’s Automated Commercial Environment—ACE, which in part-
nership  with  CBP  should  result  in  an  information  requirement  plan  for  the  best 
dataset available to CBP. 

Through  partnering  with  the  carriers,  portals,  importers,  shippers  and  terminal 
operators, CBP is gathering supply chain data, studying what it means, discovering 
where  it  can  be  most  effectively  obtained  in  the  supply  chain,  who  has  it,  how  the 
pieces  fit  together  and  determining  how  it  can  improve  our  targeting  programs.  All 
of  this  data  will  assist  us  to  zero  in  on  suspect  movements  and  perform  any  nec-
essary security inspections at the earliest point possible in the supply chain.

Question 5. Is the Bureau in the process of working with the Department of State 
on developing human resources that are trained, not only on cargo handling and in-
spection processes, but that are language and culturally proficient in the host coun-
try?  If  not,  how  are  you  addressing  the  shortfalls  in  your  human  capitol  for  man-
aging existing programs? 

Answer.  CBP  coordinates  with  Department  of  State  and  other  applicable  parties 
to  train  CBP  officers  who  are  detailed  to  overseas  locations  in  support  of  The  Con-
tainer  Security  Initiative.  These  officers  assist  host  countries  in  the  examination  of 
containerized  cargo.  As  part  of  their  training  officers  are  instructed  in  cultural 
awareness, security awareness, living overseas, pre-deployment and continued, post-
deployment foreign language training, and specific job-related skills.

Question 6. How do ocean-going carriers fit into the C–TPAT program? 
Answer. Under the C–TPAT program, ocean-going carriers must not only analyze 
and  increase  security  practices  in  their  own  operations,  but  also  verify  the  security 
of  their  service  providers  and  business  partners.  Because  ocean  carriers  transport 
high  volumes  of  ocean  going  containerized  cargo,  C–TPAT  plays  a  vital  role  in  en-
suring  the  effective  implementation  of  security  during  the  ocean  transportation 
phase.  In  fact,  C–TPAT  ocean-going  carriers  transport  approximately  95  percent  of 
all  the  U.S.-bound  maritime  container  carrier  traffic.  While  CBP  has  had  partner-
ships  with  ocean-going  carriers  since  1984  through  the  Carrier  Initiative  Program, 
C–TPAT has enabled ocean-going carriers to significantly impact and improve their 
security practices.

Question 7. GAO’s statement refers to two programs to improve supply-chain-secu-
rity, the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and Customs-Trade Partnership Against 
Terrorism  (C–TPAT).  GAO’s  July  2003  report  said  that  these  start-up  programs 
were  not  designed  with  a  longer  term  strategic  focus  and  recommended  that  both 
programs  needed  to  have  strategic  plans,  human  capital  plans,  and  performance 
measures. CBP agreed to implement these recommendations. Since GAO’s July 2003 
report,  what  progress  has  been  made  in  implementing  GAO’s  recommendations  re-
lated to strategic plans, human capital plans, and performance measures? 

Answer. CSI has developed a series of strategic and human capital plans to meas-
ure the Initiative’s outcome, information and efficiency. Outcome is evaluated by the 
percent of worldwide U.S. destined containers processed through CSI ports and the 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  11:29 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025728 PO 00000 Frm 00097 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\25728.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

94

number  of  foreign  mitigated  examinations.  Information  is  measured  by  the  number 
of: intelligence reports based on CSI foreign sources; operational CSI ports; positive 
findings;  and  investigative  cases  initiated  due  to  CSI  activity.  Finally,  efficiency  is 
appraised by the average cost per CSI port to achieve operational status. 

The C–TPAT Strategic Plan was completed and distributed in December 2004 and 
the  Human  Capital  Plan  was  developed  in  February  2005.  CBP  has  recognized  the 
need  for  outside  assistance  in  the  development  of  performance  measures  beyond 
general workload measures and has contracted with an outside firm to assist in the 
collection and development of performance measures. The development of these per-
formance measures is expected to be completed in 8 to 10 months.

Question  7a.  Whether  these  recommendations  have  been  implemented  or  not, 
what  other  problems  or  challenges  is  CBP  facing  with  the  CSI  and  C–TPAT  efforts 
to improve the supply chain? 

Answer. As the C–TPAT program has grown, CBP has taken steps to more clearly 
define minimum security criteria, or baseline security standards, for membership in 
this voluntary, incentives based program. Additional personnel resources have been 
added so that members can be more timely validated against these security criteria. 
Validations  are  routinely  taking  place  in  countries  throughout  the  world,  with  the 
exception  of  China,  which  has  not  allowed  CBP  C–TPAT  Supply-Chain-Security 
Specialists  entry  into  the  country.  CSI  has  not  been  confronted  with  any  problems 
or challenges in implementing the GAO recommendations. 

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, U.S. COAST GUARD 

Washington, DC, February 25, 2005

Hon. Harold Rogers, 
Chairman, 
House Subcommittee on Homeland Security, 
Committee on Appropriations, 
Washington, DC.
Dear Mr. Chairman:

Pursuant to your request, attached is the Coast Guard’s Unfunded Priorities List 
(UPL).  The  Fiscal  Year  2006  budget  currently  before  Congress  represents  my  high-
est priorities. 

As mentioned in the President’s signing statement on H.R. 4567, the Department 
of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2005, to the extent that provisions of the 
Act  (Public  Law  108–334),  including  section  514,  call  for  submission  of  legislative 
recommendations  to  the  Congress,  the  executive  branch  shall  construe  such  provi-
sions in a manner consistent with the President’s constitutional authority to super-
vise  the  unitary  executive  branch  and  to  recommend  for  the  consideration  of  the 
Congress such measures as the President shall judge necessary and expedient. How-
ever, I am providing this list to you as a matter of comity. 

The  Coast  Guard  is  extremely  grateful  for  and  has  benefited  from  the  increased 
resources provided by the President and Congress over the past several years. Since 
September 11, 2001, the Coast Guard has enjoyed a substantial increase in funding. 
Specifically,  the  Coast  Guard’s  FY  2006  discretionary  budget  would  provide  nearly 
$3.2 billion more than the comparable FY 2001 level, growing the Coast Guard’s an-
nual appropriation by 85 percent since the attacks of September 11, 2001. These ad-
ditional  resources  have  enabled  the  Coast  Guard  to  establish  13  Maritime  Safety 
and  Security  Teams  across  the  Nation,  deploy  over  80  new  small  boats  and  accom-
panying  crews,  expand  our  intelligence  capabilities.  and  implement  the  2002  Mari-
time  Transportation  Security  Act  (MTSA).  Each  of  these  initiatives,  among  many 
others, have been critical to allowing the Coast Guard to meet post 9/11 mission de-
mands, while ensuring no degradation in other performance areas. 

The  President’s  FY  2006  budget  request  also  represents  an  11  percent  increase 
over  the  comparable  FY  2005  discretionary  funding  levels,  and  demonstrates  ex-
tremely  strong  commitment  by  the  Administration  to  ensure  the  Coast  Guard  is 
adequately  funded.  The  resources  contained  in  the  budget  continue  to  implement 
the core elements of the Department’s Maritime Strategy for Homeland Security. For 
example,  robust  implementation  of  organic  Airborne  Use  of  Force  (AUF)  capability 
and  additional  Response  Boat-Small  allowances  will  greatly  increase  operational 
presence  and  response  posture.  The  President’s  budget  also  includes  several  Mari-
time  Domain  Awareness  (MDA)  initiatives;  such  as  implementing  the  Coast  Guard 
Common  Operational  Picture  (COP),  continuing  the  nationwide  Automatic  Identi-
fication  System  (AIS),  and  augmenting  maritime  patrol  aircraft.  These  capabilities 
are  of  foremost  importance  to  early  detection,  identification.  and  interception  of

Thank  you  for  your  interest  in  the  Coast  Guard.  I  am  happy  to  answer  any  fur-
ther  question  you  may  have,  or  your  staff  may  contact  my  House  Liaison  Office  at
