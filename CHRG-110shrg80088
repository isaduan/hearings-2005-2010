OVERSIGHT  OF  THE  CORPORATE  AVERAGE 

FUEL  ECONOMY  (CAFE)  PROGRAM 

TUESDAY,  MARCH  6,  2007 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10:30  a.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Mark  Pryor,  pre-
siding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 

Senator  PRYOR.  Well,  I  want  to  thank  the  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee  for  being  here,  and  I  also  want  to  thank  our  witnesses  and 
guests  for  being  with  us  today.  Chairman  Inouye  has  bestowed  an 
honor on me to allow me to chair the Committee today, and it’s an 
honor for me to do that. 

Today,  we’ll  look  at  both  the  Corporate  Average  Fuel  Economy 
Program—the program that was designed to improve fuel efficiency 
for passenger cars and light trucks—and current efforts to improve 
the  fuel  economy  of  the  entire  passenger  fleet.  Last  week,  I  was 
part  of  a  bipartisan  group  of  Senators  that  went  to  the  White 
House  to  talk  to  President  Bush  and  Vice  President  Cheney  about 
energy  issues  here  in  the  Senate—this  is  one  of  the  things  they 
wanted  us  to  legislate  on.  They  wanted  us  to  come  up  with  a  new 
CAFE regime, or a new set of standards. And certainly, I think we 
can find common ground with the White House, Democrats and Re-
publicans, House and Senate, all the way around on this very, very, 
important issue. 

Given the fact that we anticipate we will have a number of Sen-
ators here today, and we know there’s a heavy committee schedule, 
so  some  will  probably  have  to  come  and  go,  what  I  would  like  to 
do  is  for  people  to  forego  their  opening  statements,  but  do  a  7- 
minute round of questions, so if people want to make a little open-
ing  statement  during  their  round,  that’s  certainly  fine  with  the 
Chair,  and  I’m  sure  it  will  be  with  the  Committee,  but  I  want  to 
give Senators 7 minutes during their rounds. 

In  1975,  the  Senate  successfully  passed  the  first  fuel  economy 
standards for passenger cars. It was part of the Energy Policy and 
Conservation  Act  of  1975.  Manufacturers  were  required  to  achieve 
27.5 miles per gallon for the passenger car fleet. The standard-set-
ting  legislation  in  1975  proved  to  be  effective,  as  the  fuel  economy 
of  cars  nearly  doubled  within  10  years,  and  automobile  fuel  con-

sumption  was  reduced  by  an  estimated  2.8  million  barrels  of  oil  a 
day. 

After  the  original  goal  was  met  in  1985,  focus  on  fuel  efficiency 
seemingly  went  into  idle,  went  into  neutral.  Since  then,  the  CAFE 
program  for  passenger  cars  has  not  been  updated,  despite  efforts 
by  Chairman  Inouye,  myself,  and  many  others  on  this  committee 
and  in  the  Senate.  This  inability  to  continue  to  improve  our  fuel 
economy  standards  is  disappointing  to  many,  since  fuel  efficiency 
technologies  and  designs  have  improved  greatly  over  the  past  20 
years. 

Another  year  has  passed,  and  the  need  to  act  has  become  more 
acute.  President  Bush  even  highlighted  this  issue  in  his  State  of 
the  Union  Address.  I  think  updating  the  CAFE  program  in  an 
achievable and logical manner is of critical importance. 

Families in Arkansas and Americans across the country can ben-
efit immensely from greater fuel economy. I know that many of my 
constituents are growing tired of relying on unstable regions to pro-
vide energy to fuel their vehicles. I know my colleagues in Congress 
are  growing  tired  of  dealing  with  foreign  policy  decisions  that  are 
greatly  complicated  by  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil.  I  know  that 
we  are  all  growing  tired  of  paying  upwards  of  $50  each  time  we 
head to the gas pump. 

I believe we must do better for our constituents, our country, and 
for  the  world  we  live  in.  Our  constituents  understand  that  more 
fuel-efficient  vehicles  can  help  reduce  their  dependence  on  foreign 
oil,  lower  costs  at  the  pump,  and  limit  the  environmental  damage 
caused by vehicle emissions. And they expect us to act. 

For  these  reasons,  I  look  forward  to  this  hearing,  and  it  will 
begin  our  dialogue  on  this  issue  of  fuel  economy  standards  in  the 
110th Congress. I hope the Committee and the Senate will address 
this  issue  in  a  bipartisan  manner  and  make  substantial,  measur-
able progress this year on CAFE legislation. 

Today, our witnesses will be comprised of two panels, and I look 
forward to hearing their testimony. But, first, I would like to recog-
nize Senator Stevens for his opening statement. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Mr.  Chairman,  I’ll  be  happy  to  accept  your 
suggestion  and  make  my  statement  at  the  beginning  of  the  ques-
tions. Thank you. 

Senator PRYOR. OK. 
Chairman Inouye? 

STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

The  CHAIRMAN.  May  I  ask  that  my  statement  be  made  part  of 

the record? 

Senator PRYOR. Without objection. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Inouye follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 
The Corporate Average Fuel Economy Program, or CAFE, has proven to be an ef-
fective tool to decrease the consumption of fuel in the passenger fleet. The National 
Academy of Sciences found in its 2002 CAFE study that the CAFE program has sig-
nificantly contributed to increased fuel economy of the Nation’s passenger fleet since 
its inception in 1975. From the time CAFE was implemented until 1985, passenger 
cars  achieved  a  75  percent  increase  in  fuel  economy.  Light  truck  CAFE  standards 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  08:33 Apr 16, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80088.TXT JACKIE

3 

led to a fuel economy increase of 50 percent. The National Academy also found that 
improvements  to  vehicle  design  between  1975  and  1985  improved  fuel  economy  by 
an average of 62 percent for all vehicles without loss of performance. 

Despite past progress, a lack of will and years of inaction in improving CAFE has 
led to increased fuel consumption in the passenger fleet, thereby increasing the rate 
of  global  warming  and  making  us  more  dependent  on  foreign  oil.  Passenger  car 
CAFE  standards  have  remained  stagnant  for  more  than  20  years.  The  light  truck 
standard  was  not  improved  by  the  Department  of  Transportation  until  2003,  and 
those  efforts  have  been  criticized  as  insufficient  by  many  constituencies  and  Mem-
bers of Congress. 

We cannot turn back the clock to reclaim lost opportunities, but we must take the 
necessary steps to reduce fuel consumption in the passenger fleet now. Several Sen-
ators  have  introduced  legislation  to  improve  CAFE  standards,  including  the  Vice 
Chairman. Several Members of this Committee have joined me in support of S. 357, 
the  Ten-in-Ten  Fuel  Economy  Act.  It  is  also  encouraging  that  the  President  an-
nounced  in  his  State  of  the  Union  Address  that  he  would  set  a  goal  of  improving 
fuel  economy  by  4  percent  annually,  the  same  percentage  increase  proposed  by  S. 
357. 

I  look  forward  to  today’s  testimony,  and  the  opportunity  to  work  with  Members 
of this Committee to move CAFE legislation to the floor and ultimately to the Presi-
dent’s desk. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Our  first  panel  is  Honorable  Nicole  Nason,  the 
Administrator  of  the  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administra-
tion, that we call NHTSA; and Katherine Siggerud, Director of the 
Physical Infrastructure Team at GAO. 
Ms. Nason, would you like to start? 

STATEMENT OF HON. NICOLE R. NASON, ADMINISTRATOR, 
NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION 
Ms. NASON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Vice  Chair-

man members of the panel. Thank you—— 

Senator STEVENS. Can you pull that mic toward you? 
Ms.  NASON.  Thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  be  here  today  to  dis-
cuss the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for passenger 
cars. 

In  the  State  of  the  Union  Address,  the  President  announced  his 
‘‘20 in 10’’ proposal to reduce domestic gasoline consumption by 20 
percent  in  2017.  A  key  component  of  this  plan  is  to  significantly 
boost fuel economy standards for cars. Toward that end, last month 
the  administration  forwarded  draft  legislation  to  Congress  that 
would  give  the  Secretary  of  Transportation  the  statutory  authority 
to reform fuel economy standards for passenger cars. 

The  Bush  administration  already  has  a  history  of  reforming  and 
raising  fuel  economy  standards.  Consider  our  record  on  light 
trucks, which comprise half of the vehicles sold today. This admin-
istration  raised  the  CAFE  standard  for  light  trucks  for  7  consecu-
tive  years,  2005  to  2011.  Our  2006  light  truck  rule  not  only  will 
save  a  record  amount  of  fuel,  it  also  regulated,  for  the  first  time, 
fuel economy for some of the heaviest light trucks. 

However,  the  method  by  which  these  accomplishments  were 
achieve,  we  believe,  is  the  most  important.  In  its  2002  study  on 
CAFE  by  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  the  NAS  found  that, 
while  the  CAFE  program  did  fulfill  its  original  goals,  it  contained 
flaws  that  were  preventing  the  program  from  living  up  to  its  full 
potential. For example, one of the NAS criticisms was that the pro-
gram  concentrated  most  of  the  regulatory  requirements  on  a  few 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  08:33 Apr 16, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\80088.TXT JACKIE

4 

full-line  manufacturers.  This  resulted  in  some  manufacturers  al-
ready  above  the  standard  not  being  required  to  make  any  further 
improvements  in  fuel  efficiency.  This  means  we  are  continuing  to 
lose potential fuel savings from a significant portion of the fleet. 

Next, the NAS study estimated that CAFE probably had cost be-
tween  1,300  and  2,600  lives  in  1  year  alone,  1993,  because  the 
standards  were  structured  in  a  way  that  enabled  automakers  to 
meet  much  of  their  compliance  obligations  by  downsizing  cars. 
NHTSA  carefully  considered  the  NAS  study  and  methodically  de-
veloped  a  new  structure  for  light  truck  CAFE  standards  that  ad-
dressed  each  of  these  criticisms.  This  new  standard,  which  we  call 
‘‘Reformed CAFE,’’ is based on requiring automakers to achieve im-
proved  fuel  economy,  not  by  downsizing,  but  by  adding  fuel-saving 
technologies.  Basing  CAFE  on  adding  fuel-saving  technologies  has 
a  number  of  benefits.  First,  by  setting  fuel  economy  targets  for 
every  size  of  vehicle,  instead  of  having  one  flat  standard,  every 
model  will  potentially  have  to  improve  fuel  economy.  Reformed 
CAFE helps to ensure that vehicles—small, medium, or large—can 
become more fuel efficient. 

Second, under Reformed CAFE there is no longer an incentive for 
automakers to improve their fleet by downsizing. By removing this 
incentive,  we  can  raise  the  CAFE  standard  without  decreasing 
safety. 

And,  third,  since  Reformed  CAFE  seeks  to  achieve  greater  fuel 
efficiency  from  every  model  vehicle  affected,  every  automaker  can 
share  the  regulatory  burden  for  improving  fuel  economy,  not  just 
a few. 

Finally,  our  draft  bill  contains  a  voluntary  CAFE  credit  trading 
provision,  which  could  help  alleviate  regulatory  costs  for  manufac-
turers. 

Mr.  Chairman,  the  President  has  stated  his  desire  to  raise  the 
fuel economy standard. We believe that having experts develop the 
standard, using sound science and data in an open and reviewable 
rulemaking  process  is  the  most  responsible  way  to  determine  the 
new CAFE standard. 

If  Congress  authorizes  the  Secretary  to  reform  CAFE  for  pas-
senger  cars,  we  will  immediately  begin  a  rulemaking  to  boost  pas-
senger car fuel economy. If the administration’s draft legislation is 
enacted  soon,  cars  rolling  off  the  assembly  line  for  the  2010  model 
year could have to meet a higher CAFE standard. 

Mr. Chairman, given NHTSA’s recent experience with setting the 
fuel  economy  standard  for  light  trucks,  we  believe  we  have  dem-
onstrated our capability to set balanced standards for passenger ve-
hicles, given the authority for the reform. 

Thank you. I would be pleased to answer any questions. 
[The prepared statement of Ms. Nason follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. NICOLE R. NASON, ADMINISTRATOR, 

NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION 

Mr. Chairman, thank you for inviting me to discuss Corporate Average Fuel Econ-

omy standards (CAFE) for passenger cars. 

In  January,  the  President  announced  in  the  State  of  the  Union  address  his  ‘‘20 
in 10’’ proposal that would reduce domestic gasoline consumption by twenty percent 
in 2017. A key component of the President’s ‘‘20 in 10’’ plan is to significantly boost 
fuel  economy  standards  for  cars.  Toward  that  end,  last  month  the  Administration

5 

forwarded  draft  legislation  at  the  request  of  Representatives  Dingell  and  Boucher 
that  would  give  the  Secretary  of  Transportation  the  statutory  authority  to  reform 
and raise fuel economy standards for passenger cars. 

The Bush Administration already has a history of reforming and raising fuel econ-
omy for light trucks. Consider our record: this Administration has raised the CAFE 
standard  for  light  trucks  for  seven  consecutive  years,  from  2005  to  2011.  Our  2006 
light  truck  rule  not  only  will  save  a  record  amount  of  fuel,  it  also  regulates  for  the 
first  time  fuel  economy  for  some  of  the  heaviest  light  trucks,  such  as  the  Hummer 
H2.  This  rule  also  boosted  the  CAFE  target  for  some  light  trucks  to  a  level  that 
exceeds the Congressionally-mandated passenger car standard of 27.5 miles per gal-
lon. 

While  these  are  notable  accomplishments,  the  method  by  which  they  were 
achieved  is  probably  the  most  important.  In  its  landmark  2002  study  on  CAFE  by 
the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  the  NAS  found  that  while  the  CAFE  program 
did  fulfill  its  original  goals,  it  contained  flaws  that  were  preventing  the  program 
from living up to its potential. 

For  example,  one  of  the  NAS  criticisms  was  that  the  program  concentrated  most 
of  the  regulatory  requirements  on  a  few  full  line  manufacturers.  This  resulted  in 
some  manufacturers  who  produced  primarily  smaller  vehicles  not  being  required  to 
make any further improvements in fuel efficiency. 

Additionally,  the  study  found  that  having  a  ‘‘one-size-fits-all’’  standard  allowed 
some automakers to produce fleets that met the standard even though many of the 
cars in the fleets were relatively fuel inefficient. This meant that we were, and still 
are, losing fuel savings from a significant part of the fleet. 

Finally, and most disturbingly, the study estimated that CAFE probably had cost 
between  1,300  and  2,600  lives  in  1  year  alone,  1993,  because  the  standards  were 
structured in a way that enabled automakers to meet much of their compliance obli-
gations by downsizing cars. 

NHTSA  carefully  considered  the  NAS  study,  and  methodically  developed  a  new 
structure  for  light  truck  CAFE  standards  that  addressed  each  of  these  criticisms. 
This  new  system,  called  ‘‘Reformed  CAFE,’’  is  based  on  requiring  automakers  to 
achieve  improved  fuel  economy  not  by  downsizing,  but  by  adding  fuel-saving  tech-
nologies.  Basing  CAFE  standards  on  adding  fuel-saving  technology  instead  of 
downsizing vehicles has a number of benefits. First, by setting fuel economy targets 
for  every  size  of  vehicle,  this  ensures  that  vehicles  small,  medium  and  large  have 
to improve fuel economy. 

Second,  under  Reformed  CAFE  there  is  no  longer  an  incentive  for  automakers  to 
improve  their  fleet  average  by  downsizing.  Accordingly,  no  longer  will  raising  the 
CAFE standard mean a decrease in safety. 

Third, since Reformed CAFE demands greater fuel efficiency from every model of 
vehicle  affected,  every  automaker  will  share  the  regulatory  burden  for  improving 
fuel economy, not just a few. 

Finally,  the  Administration’s  draft  bill  contains  a  CAFE  credit  trading  provision. 
The NAS study pointed out how the current CAFE system makes it more expensive 
than necessary to achieve a given level of fuel economy in the vehicle fleet. Because 
one  company  may  find  it  less  expensive  than  another  company  to  increase  the  fuel 
economy of its fleet, there are further cost-savings to be gained from allowing credit 
trading across companies. 

CAFE already allows a manufacturer to accumulate credits if its fleet mix exceeds 
the  standard.  These  credits  may  be  carried  forward  or  ‘‘banked’’  and  used  to  offset 
future  CAFE  deficits  by  the  same  manufacturer.  Credit  trading  is  a  natural  exten-
sion of this framework. 

Credit  trading  would  be  purely  voluntary,  and  we  believe  it  will  help  lower  the 

industry’s cost of complying with CAFE. 

In 1975 when Congress wrote the original CAFE standard, it did so by taking the 
average  fuel  economy  number  for  the  fleet  and  doubling  it  over  a  ten-year  period. 
Today,  NHTSA  can  perform  a  much  more  sophisticated  analysis  on  how  to  deter-
mine the CAFE standard. We can do this because we have the benefit of individual-
ized data on the fuel-saving capabilities of each car. 

Accordingly,  there  is  no  need  to  set  an  arbitrary  fuel  economy  standard,  there  is 
no need to sacrifice safety for better fuel economy, and there is no reason why some 
auto  companies  have  to  shoulder  nearly  all  the  regulatory  burden.  Our  light  truck 
rule demonstrated that all of these problems can be overcome. 

Mr.  Chairman,  the  President  indicated  in  his  State  of  the  Union  address  his  de-
sire to raise the fuel economy standard. We believe that having experts develop the 
standard, using sound science and hard data, in an open and reviewable rulemaking 
process, is the most responsible way to determine a new CAFE standard.

If  Congress  authorizes  the  Secretary  to  reform  CAFE  for  passenger  cars,  we  will 
immediately begin a rulemaking to boost passenger car fuel economy. If the Admin-
istration’s draft legislation is enacted soon, cars rolling off the assembly line for the 
2010 model year will have to meet a higher CAFE standard. 

Mr.  Chairman,  given  NHTSA’s  recent  experience  with  setting  the  fuel  economy 
standard for light trucks, which comprise half the vehicle sold today, we believe we 
have  demonstrated  our  capability  to  set  balanced  standards  for  passenger  vehicles, 
given the authority for reform. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you. 
Ms. Siggerud? 

STATEMENT OF KATHERINE SIGGERUD, DIRECTOR, PHYSICAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE,  U.S.  GOVERNMENT  ACCOUNTABILITY 
OFFICE (GAO) 
Ms.  SIGGERUD.  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Vice  Chair-
man and Members of the Committee, I appreciate the invitation to 
testify  on  the  Nation’s  approach  to  reducing  oil  consumption 
through fuel economy standards. It is important that any approach 
to reducing oil consumption in the United States include the trans-
portation sector. Transportation accounts for 68 percent of the Na-
tion’s oil consumption, and, within that sector, 60 percent of the oil 
is consumed by cars and light trucks. 

The  Corporate  Average  Fuel  Economy,  or  CAFE,  program  was 
developed  in  the  1970s  to  increase  the  fuel  economy  of  cars  and 
light  trucks  sold  and  driven  in  the  United  States.  While  the  fuel 
economy  standards  for  light  trucks  have  been  increased  over  time, 
and were recently restructured by NHTSA, the car standards have 
been  largely  static  for  two  decades.  Both  the  administration  and 
Members  of  Congress  have  proposed  changes  that  would  increase 
fuel economy for cars. 

My  testimony  today  is  based  on  our  ongoing  work  for  the  Chair-
man  of  this  Committee,  and  will  cover,  first,  recent  and  proposed 
changes to the CAFE standards; second, observations about the re-
cent changes, the existing CAFE program, and plans to further re-
vise  the  CAFE  standards;  and,  third,  observations  about  how  the 
CAFE program aligns with other approaches and options for reduc-
ing  oil  consumption.  We  will  be  reporting  on  our  work  in  full  in 
July. 

With  regard  to  the  recent  and  proposed  changes  to  CAFE,  Ad-
ministrator  Nason  has  covered  the  administration’s  proposal.  In 
addition to raising the light truck standards and including, for the 
first  time,  some  light  trucks  that  weigh  up  to  10,000  pounds,  the 
program  was  restructured  to  set  different  fuel  efficiency  standards 
for  light  trucks  based  on  attributes;  specifically,  their  footprint, 
which is closely related to their size. 

This  restructuring  was  meant  to  address  safety  consequences 
and  concerns  about  the  disparate  effects  on  manufacturers  that 
had  been  cited  as  negative  consequences  of  raising  CAFE  stand-
ards. Rather than reducing the weight of their vehicles to reach the 
standards,  manufacturers  now  have  an  incentive  to  increase  fuel 
economy across all their vehicles. 

The  administration  has  proposed  an  attribute-based  approach  to 
raising the standards for cars, and also proposed to allow manufac-
turers that exceed the standards to trade credits to other manufac-
turers or to use them within their own fleets.

The  CAFE  program  has  been  successful  in  increasing  and  main-
taining  fuel  efficiency,  and  we’ve  found  broad  support  for  increas-
ing  the  CAFE  standards  for  cars.  In  our  discussion  with  stake-
holders from industry, academia, and the safety community we also 
found support for the changes NHTSA has made to the light truck 
program particularly the attribute-based approach. 

While  the  extent  to  which  this  approach  will  improve  fuel  econ-
omy will not be evident for several years, stakeholders explain that 
the restructured program takes important steps in addressing safe-
ty  and  fairness  issues.  Most  were  supportive  of  adopting  a  similar 
approach when increasing standards for cars. 

The  proposal  regarding  credit  trading  is  a  new  concept,  sup-
ported  by  experts,  that  will  need  additional  analysis  to  determine 
its potential. Experts we consulted also identified several other pos-
sible  reforms  to  improve  the  program.  These  include,  first,  harmo-
nizing light truck and car standards to reduce incentives to classify 
vehicles  as  light  trucks  because  of  their  lower  mileage  standards. 
Second,  reassessing  the  length  of  time  for  which  standards  are  set 
in  order  to  reduce  cost  for  manufacturers.  And,  third,  evaluating 
the  distinction  between  the  domestic  and  foreign  fleets,  given 
changes in where and how automobiles are manufactured. 

With  regard  to  NHTSA’s  actions  to  change  the  car  standards, 
Congress’s  prohibition  from  1996  through  2001  against  reforming 
the  standards  kept  NHTSA  from  considering  the  kind  of  pro-
grammatic changes we have been discussing. As a result, the agen-
cy  lost  some  expertise  necessary  for  a  significant  revision  of  the 
program. But NHTSA’s recent experience in restructuring the light 
truck  standards  helped  to  redevelop  that  expertise  and  provided  a 
model. 

Unlike  the  light  truck  program,  NHTSA  cannot  restructure  the 
program  for  cars  without  congressional  direction.  Assuming  that 
Congress provides this direction, there are additional ways NHTSA 
could  improve  its  capabilities.  These  include,  first,  obtaining  addi-
tional  expertise  on  automotive  engineering  to  review  the  product 
plans automakers submit in the CAFE rulemaking process; second, 
updating  a  2002  National  Academy  of  Sciences  study  on  auto-
motive  technologies  for  improving  fuel  economy.  It  is  now  out  of 
date  with  regard  to  the  technologies  it  assessed  and  their  associ-
ated costs. 

Finally,  when  the  CAFE  program  was  created,  greenhouse  gas 
emissions  were  not  viewed  as  an  important  issue.  Identifying  a 
valuation of these emissions when estimating the costs and benefits 
of  changes  to  CAFE’s  standards  is  important  if  the  Nation  decides 
to  act  to  control  these  emissions.  When  we  report,  this  summer,  I 
anticipate  placing  the  CAFE  program  in  context  of  other  existing 
and  potential  programs  to  reduce  oil  consumption  by  the  transpor-
tation sector. 

While the CAFE program concentrates on the supply of vehicles, 
other  programs  focus  on  the  demand  for  fuel-efficient  vehicles  by 
encouraging or requiring their purchase. It is also possible to inte-
grate  the  transportation  sector  with  other  significant  users  of  oil. 
We  will  identify  policies  that  potentially  decrease  the  effectiveness 
of  the  CAFE  program,  as  well,  when  we  report  out,  this  summer.

Mr.  Chairman,  that  concludes  my  statement.  I’m  happy  to  take 

any questions you may have. 

[The prepared statement of Ms. Siggerud follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF KATHERINE SIGGERUD, DIRECTOR, PHYSICAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE (GAO) 

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: 
We  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  provide  testimony  on  the  Nation’s  approach  to 
reducing  oil  consumption  through  fuel  efficiency  standards.  Concerns  over  national 
security, environmental stresses, and economic pressures from increased fuel prices 
have  led  to  the  Nation’s  interest  in  reducing  oil  consumption.  Several  Members  of 
Congress  have  introduced  bills  proposing  to  mandate  fuel  economy  increases,  such 
as increasing car standards from the current 27.5 miles per gallon (mpg) to 40 mpg 
within  10  years.  In  addition,  the  President  recently  announced  a  nationwide  goal 
to  reduce  oil  consumption  20  percent  from  the  levels  that  the  administration 
projects would otherwise occur by 2017. 

Efforts  to  reduce  oil  consumption  will  need  to  include  the  transportation  sector, 
because transportation in the United States currently accounts for 68 percent of the 
Nation’s  oil  consumption.  And,  within  the  transportation  sector,  60  percent  of  the 
oil  consumed  is  consumed  by  cars  and  light  trucks.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  energy 
crisis  of  the  early  1970s,  Congress  developed  the  Corporate  Average  Fuel  Economy 
(CAFE)  program  to  help  reduce  the  fuel  used  by  light  trucks  and  cars.  Under  the 
CAFE program, manufacturers must ensure that the vehicles in their fleets, on av-
erage, meet a specified mpg standard or pay a penalty. The National Highway Traf-
fic Safety Administration (NHTSA) within the Department of Transportation (DOT) 
is  primarily  responsible  for  setting  and  enforcing  CAFE  standards.  Many  changes 
in  automotive  technologies  and  the  auto  industry  have  occurred  since  the  program 
was designed in the 1970s. These developments, along with the concerns mentioned 
above,  have  led  to  some  changes  in  the  CAFE  program,  along  with  calls  to  further 
alter  the  program,  including  raising  CAFE  standards  or  revising  how  the  program 
applies the standards. 

My  testimony  today  will  discuss  (1)  recent  and  proposed  changes  to  the  CAFE 
standards;  (2)  observations  about  the  recent  changes,  the  existing  CAFE  program, 
and  NHTSA’s  capabilities  to  further  revise  CAFE  standards;  and  (3)  observations 
about how the CAFE program aligns with other approaches and options for reducing 
oil  consumption.  My  comments  are  based  on  ongoing  work  for  this  committee,  and 
therefore  my  comments  reflect  our  preliminary  observations.  We  plan  to  issue  our 
report  in  July  2007.  To  obtain  information  on  the  CAFE  program  and  recent  and 
proposed  changes  to  the  program,  we  reviewed  relevant  U.S.  Code  and  program 
guidance,  including  rulemaking  documents,  and  interviewed  a  wide  range  of  pro-
gram  stakeholders,  including  NHTSA,  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA), 
the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE),  the  applicable  automobile  workers  trade  union 
(UAW),  industry  groups  representing  the  automobile  manufacturers,  automotive 
safety experts, insurance industry representatives, and environmental advocates. To 
obtain information about recent program revisions and NHTSA’s plans and capabili-
ties  to  further  revise  CAFE  standards,  we  interviewed  NHTSA  officials,  experts  in 
fuel  economy  and  safety  as  well  as  reviewed  CAFE  program  budgets,  key  studies, 
and  other  documentation.  To  obtain  information  on  how  the  CAFE  program  aligns 
with other approaches and options for reducing oil consumption by cars and trucks, 
we  interviewed  experts  in  fuel  economy  and  other  industry  stakeholders.  We  se-
lected these experts by contacting officials who worked on a 2002 National Academy 
of Sciences report on CAFE standards. During conversations with these experts, we 
asked  them  for  additional  experts  we  should  contact.  We  also  contacted  officials  in 
selected foreign countries with programs designed to reduce oil consumption for pas-
senger  vehicles.  We  conducted  our  work  for  this  statement  from  September  2006 
through  February  2007  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  government  auditing 
standards. 

In summary: 
• In  2003,  NHTSA  raised  light  truck  CAFE  standards  from  20.7  mpg  in  2004  to 
22.2  mpg  in  2007.  Subsequently,  NHTSA  restructured  the  CAFE  program  for 
trucks  using  a  method  that  categorizes  light  trucks  based  on  their  size.  This 
new  method  is  meant  to  help  address  potential  safety  consequences  and  other 
issues that had previously been cited as negative consequences of raising CAFE 
standards. The nation’s CAFE standard for cars has changed little over the past 
2 decades, for example CAFE standards for cars have not risen above 27.5 mpg

since 1990. Furthermore, Congress included provisions in DOT’s appropriations 
acts  from  Fiscal  Years  1996  through  2001  preventing  NHTSA  from  spending 
any funds to change CAFE standards. The Secretary of Transportation recently 
asked Congress for the ability to restructure CAFE standards for cars. More re-
cently, as part of the Administration’s plan to meet the President’s oil reduction 
goal  the  Secretary  of  Transportation  submitted  a  plan  to  Congress  that  would 
allow  NHTSA  to  restructure  the  car  CAFE  program  based  on  an  attribute  of 
the vehicle, such as size. This plan mirrors NHTSA’s recent changes to the light 
truck program. In addition, several Members of Congress have introduced legis-
lation to raise CAFE standards. 
• The  majority  of  experts  with  whom  we  spoke  believe  that  CAFE  standards  are 
an important approach to reducing oil consumption; and NHTSA’s recent reform 
of the light truck standards addresses other concerns, including safety and com-
petition among individual car companies, among others. However, these experts 
also  identified  some  further  revisions  to  the  CAFE  program  that  could  be  con-
sidered  in  determining  ways  to  further  optimize  the  CAFE  program,  including: 
» evaluating  a  size-based  approach  for  cars  similar  to  the  one  implemented  for 
light trucks to address safety and other concerns and encourage fleet-wide im-
provements in fuel efficiency; 

» considering  harmonizing  light  truck  and  car  standards  to  have  an  integrated 

program and reduce incentives to classify vehicles as light trucks; 

» reassessing the length of time for which standards are set to reduce costs for 

manufacturers; 

» allowing  trading  of  CAFE  credits  between  vehicle  classes  and  among  manu-
facturers  to  provide  additional  incentives  and  flexibility  in  meeting  CAFE 
standards; and, 

» evaluating the need for the distinction between domestic and foreign vehicles 
when  calculating  CAFE  to  simplify  the  program  and  recognize  changes  in 
where automobiles are manufactured. 

Further,  experts  and  NHTSA  officials  also  identified  ways  NHTSA  could  im-
prove its capabilities to revise CAFE standards including: 
» obtaining  additional  expertise  on  automotive  engineering  to  review  product 

plans automakers submit in the CAFE rulemaking process; 

» updating  a  2002  National  Academy  of  Sciences  study  that  included  informa-
tion on the potential impact of technologies that could improve fuel economy; 
and 

» identifying  a  valuation  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  used  in  analysis  to  esti-

mate the costs and benefits of changes to CAFE standards. 

• Finally,  while  the  CAFE  program  is  an  important  program  in  the  Nation’s  ef-
forts  to  reduce  oil  consumption,  other  policies  and  programs  exist  or  have  been 
proposed to help the Nation reduce oil consumption by the transportation sector 
that could complement CAFE. We will be reporting in more detail on how these 
options  align  with  the  CAFE  program  in  July  2007.  We  will  also  identify  poli-
cies that potentially decrease the effectiveness of the CAFE program in reducing 
oil  consumption.  For  example,  experts  with  whom  we  spoke  identified  the  pro-
gram that grants manufacturers a 1.2 mpg CAFE credit toward meeting its fuel 
economy  standard  for  selling  flexible  fuel  vehicles,  even  though  these  vehicles 
are not often run on fuel other than gas. 

Background 

Congress  enacted  the  1975  Energy  Policy  and  Conservation  Act  (the  Energy  Act) 
during  the  aftermath  of  the  energy  crisis  created  by  the  Arab  oil  embargo  of  1973 
and  1974  to  reduce  oil  consumption  by  the  transportation  sector  in  the  United 
States.1 The Act established what is commonly known as the CAFE program, which 
requires  that  manufacturers  meet  separate  fuel  economy  standards  for  passenger 
cars  and  light  trucks.2 To  reduce  oil  consumption,  the  program  uses  fuel  consump-
tion  standards—measured  in  mpg—that  cars  and  light  trucks  must  meet.  In  addi-
tion  to  decreasing  oil  consumption  by  increasing  the  mileage  driven  on  a  gallon  of 

1 Pub. L. 94–163. 
2 For  CAFE  purposes,  NHTSA  currently  defines  light  truck  as  a  four-wheel  vehicle  which  is 
designed for off-road operation or which is designed to perform certain functions such as trans-
porting more than 10 people or transporting property in an open bed. This includes most pickup 
trucks,  minivans,  and  sport  utility  vehicles.  The  most  recent  standards  NHTSA  set  will  apply 
to trucks up to 10,000 lbs. and pickup trucks up to 8,500 lbs.

gas, an increase in the standards also decreases tailpipe emissions, including green-
house gases. 

A  manufacturer’s  compliance  is  based  on  a  comparison  of  a  manufacturer’s  fleet- 
wide  fuel  economy  average  against  the  appropriate  CAFE  standard.3 The  Energy 
Act  grants  NHTSA  the  authority  to  calculate  a  car  and  light  truck  figure  for  each 
manufacturer,  measuring  compliance  of  domestically  produced  and  imported  cars, 
separately.  The  law  considers  a  vehicle  domestic  if  at  least  75  percent  of  the  cost 
of  the  vehicle  to  the  manufacturer  is  attributable  to  value  added  in  the  United 
States, Mexico, or Canada. 

Congress set a standard for passenger cars (currently 27.5 mpg) but did not estab-
lish specific CAFE standards for light trucks in the Energy Act. Instead, the Energy 
Act  grants  NHTSA  authority  to  establish  both  the  structure  of  the  CAFE  program 
and  the  fuel  economy  standards  for  different  classes  of  light  trucks.  Rather  than 
Congress  specifying  a  mpg  target  for  light  trucks  as  it  did  for  passenger  cars, 
NHTSA  is  required  to  set  standards  at  the  maximum  feasible  level  using  the  same 
criteria  and  lead-time  requirements  used  in  setting  standards  for  passenger  cars. 
However, appropriations acts restricted NHTSA from increasing or otherwise chang-
ing  CAFE  standards  from  Fiscal  Year  1996  through  2001.  For  Fiscal  Year  2002, 
Congress did not renew the multiyear freeze on NHTSA’s CAFE rulemaking respon-
sibilities  and  the  agency  resumed  efforts  for  future  rulemakings  to  raise  CAFE 
standards for light trucks. 

The  CAFE  program  is  generally  considered  to  have  contributed  to  increasing  the 
Nation’s  fuel  economy.  For  example,  a  2002  NAS  report  found  that  the  CAFE  pro-
gram  has  been  particularly  helpful  in  keeping  fuel  economy  above  levels  to  which 
it  might  have  fallen  due  to  the  low  and  declining  real  price  of  gas.  The  NAS  study 
estimated  that  if  fuel  economy  had  not  improved,  gas  consumption  and  oil  imports 
would have been about 14 percent higher than they were in 2002. 

To help meet CAFE standards, manufacturers may earn credits that can be used 
to help them meet fuel economy standards. For instance, if a manufacturer exceeds 
the  required  fuel  economy  in  a  certain  year,  it  earns  credits  that  can  be  applied  to 
past  or  future  model-year  fuel  economy  numbers.  Credits,  however,  cannot  be 
passed  between  manufacturers  or  among  fleets.  In  addition,  the  Alternative  Motor 
Fuels Act of 1988 encourages the use of alternative fuels by giving credits to manu-
facturers toward meeting CAFE standards for producing cars that can run on alter-
native fuels 4 in addition to gas. Under the resulting ‘‘Dual Fuel’’ program, manufac-
turers  may  earn  up  to  a  1.2  mpg  credit  for  producing  vehicles  through  model  year 
2010  that  are  capable  of  using  both  regular  gasoline  and  an  alternative  fuel.5 If  a 
manufacturer does not meet the standards and has no credits to apply, it must pay 
a civil penalty. 

In addition to CAFE standards administered by NHTSA, Congress and other Fed-
eral  agencies  have  established  programs  to  reduce  oil  consumption  in  the  transpor-
tation  sector.  These  programs  include  (1)  vehicle  acquisition  requirements  at  Fed-
eral  agencies  to  purchase  alternative  fuel  vehicles,  (2)  research  and  development  of 
alternative fuels and new vehicle technologies, and (3) tax incentives for consumers 
purchasing fuel efficient vehicles like hybrids. 

In addition to NHTSA, other Federal entities contribute to the Nation’s efforts to 
reduce  oil  consumption.  For  example,  DOE  coordinates  Federal  research  on  strate-
gies  for  reducing  oil  consumption;  developing  advanced  technologies  such  as  fuel 
cells;  producing  and  using  alternative  fuels  and  more  fuel  efficient  vehicle  tech-
nology,  as  well  as  providing  grants  for  research  into  such  areas  as  plug-in  hybrid 6 
technology  and  ways  to  expand  the  production  and  use  of  ethanol.  In  addition,  the 
National  Economic  Council  assists  the  administration  in  developing  its  energy  ini-
tiatives. 

3 For  example,  manufacturers  meet  the  standard  if  the  average  mpg  of  all  the  vehicles  they 
manufacture in a year meet the CAFE standard for that year. Manufacturers have had to meet 
mpg  of  27.5  for  cars  since  1990.  EPA  performs  the  tests  that  determine  what  mpg  each  manu-
facturer’s model obtains. A model’s CAFE figure generally differs from the window sticker a new 
vehicle displays showing its fuel economy. The window sticker mpg is determined through a dif-
ferent methodology than the CAFE figure. 

4 Alternative fuels are fuels other than conventional fossil fuels and include ethanol, hydrogen,

tric  battery.  Plug-in  hybrids  are  vehicles  that  recharge  their  battery  at  battery  charging  sta-
tions.

NHTSA  Recently  Raised  and  Restructured  Light  Truck  CAFE  Standards 
and  Has  Not  Raised  the  Car  CAFE  Standard  Since  1990,  but  Has 
Requested Authority to Make Changes 

NHTSA has recently raised the light truck CAFE standard and reformed the pro-
gram  using  a  method  that  categorizes  light  trucks  based  on  their  size,  doing  so  in 
part  to  address  potential  safety  concerns.  CAFE  standards  for  cars  have  not 
changed  since  1990.  This  is  due,  in  part,  to  past  congressional  prohibitions  against 
NHTSA  using  any  of  its  appropriation  to  raise  fuel  economy  standards  and,  more 
recently,  NHTSA’s  preference  to  tie  raising  the  car  standard  to  restructuring  the 
program.  Recently,  the  administration  has  submitted  a  proposal  to  restructure  and 
increase  passenger  car  CAFE  standards.  Members  of  Congress  also  have  submitted 
proposals to change the CAFE standards. 
NHTSA  Recently  Increased  Standards  and  Reformed  the  Light  Truck  CAFE 

Program 

In  April  2003,  NHTSA  released  a  final  rule  increasing  light  truck  CAFE  stand-
ards  from  20.7  mpg  in  2004  to  22.2  mpg  in  2007.  As  part  of  this  rulemaking, 
NHTSA explained the importance of increasing the CAFE standards for light trucks 
because of the growing market share of these vehicles. The impact of the light truck 
market  on  overall  oil  consumption  in  the  United  States  had  grown  since  the  begin-
ning of the CAFE program as market share for these vehicles has increased. Specifi-
cally, in 1980, shortly after the program began, light trucks composed about 20 per-
cent  of  the  new  passenger  vehicle  market  in  the  United  States.  By  2005,  light 
trucks,  including  minivans,  pickup  trucks,  and  sport  utility  vehicles,  accounted  for 
about  50  percent  of  the  new  passenger  vehicle  market  in  the  United  States.  The 
overall  fuel  economy  of  the  U.S.  vehicle  fleet  declined  in  the  1990s,  in  part  due  to 
the  increased  market  share  of  light  trucks.  (See  fig.  1  showing  share  of  fleet  com-
posed by light trucks). 

While  NHTSA  took  these  steps  to  raise  CAFE  standards  for  light  trucks,  the 
agency also began investigating reforming the light truck CAFE program in part to

address safety concerns. A 2002 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report 7 on the 
impact  of  CAFE  standards 8 stated  that  because  the  easiest  way  for  an  automobile 
manufacturer  to  increase  vehicle  fuel  economy  is  to  decrease  vehicle  weight,  in-
creases to CAFE standards were likely to have a negative impact on safety and re-
sult  in  more  highway  fatalities.  The  report  recommended  that  NHTSA  investigate 
implementing a CAFE system based on the attributes of a vehicle, such as size and/ 
or  weight,  where  there  would  be  separate  standards  for  vehicles  with  similar  at-
tributes. 

In  response,  NHTSA  released  a  rule  in  April  2006  that  reforms  the  structure  of 
the  CAFE  program  for  light  trucks  and  continues  to  increase  light  truck  CAFE 
standards  for  model  years  2008  to  2011.  Under  the  new  rule,  fuel  economy  stand-
ards  are  established  based  upon  truck  size  instead  of  having  one  average  standard 
for all light trucks. Each truck is assigned a fuel economy ‘‘target’’ based on a meas-
ure of vehicle size called ‘‘footprint,’’ the product of multiplying a vehicle’s wheelbase 
(the distance from front to the rear axles) by its track width (the horizontal distance 
between  the  tires).  (See  fig.  2  for  a  display  of  how  the  standard  applies  to  trucks 
of different sizes). 

According to NHTSA officials, the reformed CAFE approach may enable the coun-
try to achieve larger reductions in oil consumption, while enhancing safety and pre-
venting adverse economic consequences. Under the current standard, manufacturers 
of smaller light trucks may already exceed the fleet CAFE standard and, therefore, 
have  little  incentive  to  increase  fuel  economy.  However,  under  the  reformed  stand-
ards,  the  required  overall  fuel  economy  of  the  light  truck  fleet  will  rise  over  time. 
In addition, the reformed standards include larger vehicles such as sport utility ve-
hicles,  but  not  pickup  trucks,  weighing  between  8,500  and  10,000  pounds  that  pre-
viously  were  exempt  from  the  CAFE  program.  NHTSA  estimates  that  including 
these vehicles in the CAFE program will save 7.8 billion gallons of fuel over the life 
of the vehicles sold between 2008 and 2011.9 In addition to these expected fuel sav-
ings,  the  reformed  CAFE  standards  offer  enhanced  safety  by  discouraging

downsizing of vehicles since, as vehicles become smaller, the applicable fuel economy 
target  becomes  more  stringent.  In  addition,  according  to  NHTSA,  the  reformed 
CAFE  standards  spread  the  regulatory  cost  burden  for  fuel  economy  improvements 
more broadly across the industry instead of concentrating it more exclusively on the 
manufacturers who may produce heavier, less fuel efficient vehicles. 
NHTSA  Has  Not  Raised  the  Car  CAFE  Standard  Since  1990  but  Has  Requested 

Authority to Make Changes 

The  1975  Energy  Act  established  CAFE  standards  for  passenger  cars  for  model 
years 1978 to 1980 and 1985 and thereafter. The standards called for manufacturers 
to produce vehicles averaging 18 mpg in 1978, rising to 27.5 mpg by 1985.10 In the 
1980s,  NHTSA  reduced  the  CAFE  standard  for  cars,  and  the  agency  did  so  for 
model years 1986 to 1989. NHTSA raised the car CAFE standard back to 27.5 mpg 
for  the  1990  model  year  and  has  made  no  changes  to  the  standard  since  then.  See 
table 1 showing CAFE standards over time.

NHTSA officials cited several reasons for not raising the CAFE standard over 27.5 
mpg.  First,  for  several  years,  Congress  specifically  prevented  NHTSA  from  making 
any adjustments to CAFE. Beginning in Fiscal Year 1996 and lasting through Fiscal 
Year  2001,  Congress  included  language  in  DOT’s  appropriations  acts  preventing 
NHTSA  from  expending  any  appropriated  funds  for  rulemakings  to  adjust  CAFE 
standards, for either cars or trucks. Second, although NHTSA officials state that the 
agency  has  the  legislative  authority  to  raise  CAFE  standards  for  cars  above  27.5 
mpg,  as  specified  by  the  Energy  Act,  these  officials  stated  the  Energy  Act  prevents 
NHTSA  from  restructuring  the  program,  for  example,  by  developing  a  size-based 
standard  as  it  recently  did  for  light  trucks.11 NHTSA  is  reluctant  to  raise  the  car 

10 The Secretary of Transportation issued interim standards for 1981 to 1984. 
11 The  Energy  Act  includes  a  so-called  legislative  veto  provision  allowing  either  the  House  of 
Representatives  or  the  U.S.  Senate  to  disapprove  any  attempt  to  increase  CAFE  standards 
above the current 27.5 mpg level (or decrease them below 26.0 mpg). However, since the Energy 
Act  was  passed,  the  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  such  legislative  vetoes  are  unconstitutional.

standards  without  restructuring  the  program  as  it  is  concerned  about  the  effect  on 
safety, competition between auto manufacturers, and other issues. 

However,  in  2007  the  NHTSA  Administrator  submitted  proposed  legislation  to 
Congress  that,  if  enacted,  would  give  the  Secretary  of  Transportation  the  authority 
to restructure and increase CAFE standards for cars. The proposal calls for the fuel 
economy standard to be the maximum level that NHTSA believes the manufacturers 
could  achieve  in  a  specific  model  year.  The  proposal  would  also  give  NHTSA  the 
power  to  base  the  standard  on  one  or  more  vehicle  attributes  similar  to  the  light 
truck  standard.  In  addition,  the  proposal  calls  for  a  credit  trading  system  among 
manufacturers. If a manufacturer exceeds the mileage standard, it can sell its cred-
its  to  another  manufacturer  or  a  broker.  The  proposal  does  not  provide  a  specific 
goal  or  mpg  standard;  but,  like  the  light  truck  standard,  it  sets  an  average  fuel 
economy standard that is the maximum feasible average fuel economy level that the 
Secretary  of  Transportation  decides  the  manufacturers  can  achieve  in  a  specific 
model  year.  NHTSA  officials  indicate  that  they  may  follow  a  process  similar  to  the 
rulemaking  process  they  followed  to  recently  reform  and  set  new  light  truck  stand-
ards. 

In  addition  to  this  proposed  legislation,  several  Members  of  Congress  have  sub-
mitted  bills  that  have  some  similarities  to  the  Secretary’s  proposal  but,  if  enacted, 
would  set  a  specific  fuel  economy  mpg  standard  for  manufacturers  to  meet,  rather 
than  allow  NHTSA  to  determine  the  maximum  feasible  level.  For  example,  one  bill 
calls  for  cars  and  light  trucks  achieve  a  combined  CAFE  average  of  35  mpg  by 
2019.12 Another  bill  would  raise  CAFE  standards  for  passenger  cars  to  40  mpg  by 
2017.13 These  are  only  selected  examples  of  the  many  bills  currently  pending  in 
Congress on this topic. 
A Majority of Industry Stakeholders and Experts Support NHTSA’s Recent 
CAFE  Revisions,  While  Recommending  Further  Refinements  to  the 
CAFE  Program  and  Ways  for  NHTSA  to  Improve  Its  Capability  to 
Revise Standards 

The majority of industry stakeholders and experts with whom we spoke supported 
NHTSA’s revisions to the light truck standards, and many of them specifically stat-
ed that NHTSA should consider further refinements to the CAFE program, such as 
restructuring  the  car  CAFE  standards  based  on  the  size  of  the  vehicle.  In  addition 
to  these  refinements,  stakeholders  and  experts  identified  issues  about  both  the  ap-
propriate information for NHTSA’s rulemaking deliberations and NHTSA’s capabili-
ties  to  most  effectively  revise  car  CAFE  standards.  For  example  the  model  that 
NHTSA  uses  to  estimate  the  impact  that  changes  in  CAFE  standards  will  have  on 
oil  consumption  does  not  currently  place  a  dollar  value  on  the  reduction  of  carbon 
emissions.  If  NHTSA  is  able  to  revise  car  standards,  it  may  be  an  opportunity  to 
consider  how  to  value  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Furthermore,  many  experts  indi-
cated that the agency would benefit from some additional expertise, for example, on 
automotive  engineering  to,  among  other  duties,  review  product  plans  automakers 
submit in the CAFE rulemaking process. 
Stakeholders  and  Experts  Support  Recent  Restructuring  of  Light  Truck  Standards 
While  it  is  impossible  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  NHTSA’s  recent  restruc-
turing  of  the  light  truck  CAFE  standards  will  reduce  oil  consumption  since  the 
standards will not take full effect until vehicle model year 2011, experts and indus-
try  stakeholders  whom  we  interviewed  generally  praised  the  restructuring.  Many, 
including  representatives  from  the  insurance  industry,  specifically  praised  the  re-
structured  CAFE  program  for  removing  most  incentives  manufacturers  may  have 
had  to  reduce  vehicle  weight  in  order  to  meet  CAFE  standards,  and  thereby  make 
vehicles  less  safe.  A  number  of  experts  also  noted  that  the  restructured  standards 
treated all manufacturers more equitably, in that each company would now have an 
incentive  to  use  additional  fuel  efficient  technologies  across  its  light  truck  fleets, 
rather than only in selected vehicles needing a boost to meet CAFE standards. 

Auto  industry  representatives  with  whom  we  spoke  also  supported  the  restruc-
turing  because  it  seemed  to  spread  the  burden  of  compliance  evenly  across  the  in-
dustry. Also, industry representatives stated that the reformed light truck standard 
did not favor big or small vehicles, so manufacturers could produce a range of vehi-
cles that appeal to different segments of the market. 

A  few  experts  with  whom  we  spoke  expressed  concern  regarding  the  reformed 
standards,  stating  that  NHTSA  did  not  raise  CAFE  standards  far  enough  or  that 
the  system  could  not  guarantee  oil  savings  because  manufacturers  could  choose  to

build—and consumers might elect to buy—trucks with the largest footprints, which 
must meet lower fuel economy standards than smaller trucks. 
Experts Have Recommended Further Refinements to the CAFE Program 

Many  of  the  experts  with  whom  we  spoke  identified  several  refinements  to  the 
CAFE  program  that  could  improve  the  program  by  improving  safety,  making  the 
program  more  equitable  for  manufacturers,  or  reducing  the  costs  that  manufactur-
ers incur to comply with the program. In addition to increasing fuel efficiency stand-
ards  to  reduce  oil  consumption,  further  refinements  may  help  address  safety  con-
cerns  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  CAFE  program.  Some  of  these  potential 
changes include the following: 

• Evaluating  footprint  approach  for  cars:  Currently,  the  car  standard  uses  a  sin-
gle,  mpg  standard  as  opposed  to  the  recently  reformed  light  truck  standard, 
which  uses  a  footprint-based  standard.  The  majority  of  the  experts  with  whom 
we  spoke  believed  that  changing  the  structure  of  the  light  truck  program  to  a 
footprint-based standard was positive, and many of them specifically stated that 
NHTSA  should  be  allowed  to  evaluate  a  similar  structure  for  the  car  program. 
They  believe  that  such  a  structure  will  provide  similar  safety  benefits  to  those 
expected  with  the  revised  truck  program  and  would  also  treat  car  companies 
more equitably. 
• Harmonizing light truck and passenger vehicle standards: Currently, light truck 
and  car  standards  are  separate.  However,  of  those  experts  that  expressed  an 
opinion,  almost  all  thought  the  car  and  light  truck  CAFE  programs  should  be 
harmonized if a footprint system was instituted for cars as it has been for light 
trucks.  Experts  noted  several  advantages  of  harmonizing  the  programs,  includ-
ing reducing the current incentive for manufacturers to reclassify vehicles from 
cars to light trucks in order to be able to comply with a lower CAFE standard. 
One  expert  also  noted  that  harmonizing  cars  and  light  trucks  was  appropriate, 
given  that  light  trucks  are  now  primarily  used  as  passenger  vehicles  rather 
than as cargo and agricultural vehicles, as was the case when CAFE was insti-
tuted. 
• Reassessing  the  length  of  time  for  which  CAFE  standards  are  set:  Currently, 
NHTSA sets new CAFE standards generally for 2 to 4 years at a time with the 
first new year of standards beginning 18 months after the completion of a rule- 
making process. Of those that expressed an opinion, almost all the experts with 
whom  we  spoke  stated  that  setting  standards  for  about  7  to  10  years  out  re-
duces  costs  for  manufacturers  by  allowing  the  manufacturers  to  capitalize  on 
normally scheduled plans to redesign models. 
• Allowing  CAFE  credit  trading  between  vehicle  classes  and  among  manufactur-
ers:  Currently,  if  manufacturers  exceed  the  required  fuel  economy  in  a  certain 
year,  they  earn  credits  that  can  be  applied  to  past  or  future  model-year  fuel 
economy  numbers.  Such  credits  applied  to  previous  model  years  are  known  as 
‘‘carry-back’’  credits,  while  those  applied  to  future  model  years  are  known  as 
‘‘carry-forward’’ credits. These credits cannot be traded among manufacturers or 
between  fleets  (that  is,  between  cars  and  trucks).  Of  those  who  expressed  an 
opinion, many of the experts with whom we spoke thought that the manufactur-
ers should have greater flexibility in trading CAFE credits than is now afforded 
under  the  ‘‘carry-forward  carry-back’’  approach.  Economists  in  particular  noted 
that  credit  trading  both  between  vehicle  classes  within  a  manufacturer’  own 
fleet  and  credit  trading  among  manufacturers  would  reduce  the  compliance 
costs of CAFE for manufacturers, since manufactures for whom it would be very 
costly to achieve a CAFE standard for a particular line could trade with another 
line where exceeding the standard would be less costly. 
• Removing  the  distinction  between  domestic  versus  import  vehicles  to  calculate 
CAFE  standards:  Currently,  the  CAFE  program  determines  a  manufacture’s 
compliance  with  CAFE  car  standards  for  its  domestic-  and  foreign-made  fleets, 
separately.  According  to  a  labor  union  official,  this  distinction  was  designed  as 
a  way  to  keep  some  small  car  production  within  the  country  and  thus  protect 
workers  that  produce  small  cars  domestically.  Of  those  who  expressed  an  opin-
ion,  almost  all  the  experts  we  spoke  to  believe  that  CAFE  compliance  should 
no longer be calculated separately for domestic and import fleets. Industry rep-
resentatives noted that cars produced in Canada and Mexico count as domestic 
vehicles  and  that  many  foreign  manufacturers  make  vehicles  in  the  United 
States,  thus  the  distinction  is  not  as  meaningful  as  it  once  was.  However,  the 
union  believes  that  if  this  incentive  is  removed,  automakers  will  continue  pro-
ducing small cars in foreign markets, but close domestic plants producing small 
cars, thus adversely impacting U.S. jobs.

NHTSA and Experts Identified Ways to Improve NHTSA Capabilities to Reform the 

CAFE Program 

As  discussed  above,  the  Secretary  of  Transportation  has  submitted  legislation  to 
Congress  that,  if  enacted,  would  give  the  Secretary  of  Transportation  the  authority 
to revise CAFE standards for cars. Many of the experts with whom we spoke raised 
some concerns about NHTSA’s capabilities to revise CAFE standards. These experts 
identified several ways NHTSA could improve its capabilities to revise CAFE stand-
ards  in  the  future.  In  some  instances,  NHTSA  officials  acknowledged  the  benefit  of 
these potential improvements. 

• Expanding staff expertise and levels: Two experts with whom we spoke cited the 
congressional  prohibition  on  any  work  at  NHTSA  to  increase  CAFE  standards 
in the 1990s as a reason the agency lost qualified, experienced staff. An expert 
stated  that  in  the  past,  NHTSA  was  more  aggressive  at  critiquing  cost  esti-
mates  and  product  plans  that  automakers  submitted  when  the  agency  was  de-
termining how much of an increase in CAFE standards the auto manufacturers 
could  handle  technologically.  Several  experts  believed  that  NHTSA  currently 
does not have the capacity to do this sort of checking. NHTSA officials disagreed 
with this assessment but stated that additional staff with automotive engineer-
ing skills would help them in future CAFE rulemakings and that they will hire 
an  additional  person  with  an  automotive  engineering  background.  NHTSA  offi-
cials  agreed  that  they  are,  to  a  degree,  dependent  on  the  information  auto-
makers  provide  them  about  product  plans  and  future  technological  capabilities 
in enhancing fuel economy. 

• Updating  the  NAS  report:  NHTSA  officials  involved  in  setting  the  reformed 
light truck standard told us they relied extensively on the 2002 NAS report that 
evaluated CAFE standards. Specifically, these officials cited the report’s assess-
ment  of  the  impact  on  fuel  economy  and  cost  of  emerging  automotive  tech-
nologies as crucial to their decisionmaking about how high to raise future CAFE 
standards  and  how  quickly  to  require  future  increases.  Also,  NHTSA  officials 
stated that because the report had been peer reviewed, it was even more useful 
and  mitigated  criticism  regarding  the  agency’s  assumptions.  NHTSA  officials 
and several experts whom we interviewed supported updating the study, as the 
original  information  is  now  5  years  old  and  rapidly  becoming  outdated,  since 
technologies  on  automotive  technologies  change  quickly,  and  cost  information 
also varies over time. For example, NHTSA officials pointed out that the study 
did  not  include  an  assessment  of  alternative  technologies,  such  as  electric  hy-
brids. These officials and experts stated that it would be ideal to complete such 
an update before NHTSA issues a new car or light truck fuel economy standard, 
and  NHTSA  has  request  funding  for  such  a  study  in  its  2008  budget  proposal 
to Congress. 

• Identifying  a  valuation  for  greenhouse  gas  emissions:  Several  stakeholders  and 
experts  told  us  they  were  concerned  about  certain  inputs  that  NHTSA  officials 
used  in  the  computer  model  maintained  by  DOT’s  Volpe  Research  Center. 
NHTSA  uses  this  model  as  a  tool  to  help  estimate  the  fuel  savings  that  will 
result  from  CAFE  increases  and  to  estimate  how  likely  it  is  that  the  manufac-
turers  will  comply  with  future  CAFE  standards.14 Specifically,  some  experts 
were  critical  of  the  fact  that  NHTSA  and  Volpe  staff  assigned  a  ‘‘zero’’  dollar 
value to the benefit of reductions in greenhouse gas emission that would result 
from  an  increased  standard.  NHTSA  officials  stated  they  did  this  because  the 
scientific  community  had  not  reached  a  consensus  on  the  value  that  should  be 
assigned to carbon dioxide, though researchers have developed a range of values 
that  could  be  considered  in  giving  a  dollar  value  to  greenhouse  gas  reductions. 
Therefore, according to one expert, the results of the model may underestimate 
the  total  dollar  benefits  to  society  of  raising  CAFE  standards,  since  the  dollar 
value  of  reduced  greenhouse  gas  emissions  was  not  included  in  the  model’s  re-
sults. If the car CAFE program is revised, it may provide an opportunity to re-
visit  how  to  value  a  decrease  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions  through  improved 
fuel efficiency. 

14 NHTSA also uses the model to predict the effect of efficiency-increasing technologies on spe-
cific vehicle models and to calculate the resultant CAFE levels among vehicle manufacturers re-
sulting  from  changes  in  CAFE  standards.  The  model  also  predicts  impact  on  energy  use,  and 
other monetary and nonmonetary externalities.

Other  Federal  Programs  Also  Seek  to  Reduce  Oil  Consumption  in  the 

Transportation Sector 

17 

While  the  CAFE  program  is  an  important  program  in  the  Nation’s  efforts  to  re-
duce oil consumption, other policies and programs currently exist to help the Nation 
reduce oil consumption in the transportation sector. The White House National Eco-
nomic  Council’s  2006  Advanced  Energy  Initiative  and  the  Department  of  Energy’s 
Strategic  Plan  both  highlight  a  number  of  ongoing  programs  and  initiatives  in  the 
transportation  sector,  such  as  developing  and  deploying  alternative  fuels  that  can 
help  reduce  oil  consumption.  Other  existing  programs  include  CAFE  credits  for 
manufacturers  of  ‘‘flex  fuel’’  vehicles  capable  of  running  on  gasoline  or  alternative 
fuels, a Federal vehicle acquisition program requiring Federal agencies buy vehicles 
capable  of  running  on  alternative  fuels,15 tax  incentives  for  consumers  purchasing 
fuel efficient vehicles like hybrids, and taxes to discourage the purchase of cars with 
low  fuel  efficiency,  known  as  the  ‘‘gas  guzzler’’  tax.  We  will  be  reporting  in  July 
2007  on  the  extent  to  which  these  programs  complement  or  contradict  the  goals  of 
the CAFE program. We will also report on other proposals to reduce oil consumption 
by cars and light trucks and their potential effects. 

However, many of the experts with whom we spoke have pointed out that the pro-
gram  granting  manufacturers  a  maximum  of  1.2  mpg  CAFE  credit  toward  meeting 
fuel  economy  standards  for  flex-fuel  vehicles,  currently  may  be  actually  increasing 
oil  consumption  among  passenger  vehicles.  Specifically,  the  credit  allows  manufac-
turers  to  build  these  vehicles  to  meet  a  lower  CAFE  standard,  and  this  credit  is 
granted  regardless  of  whether  consumers  are  actually  running  the  vehicles  on  gas 
or  E85  (a  blend  of  85  percent  ethanol).16 As  a  result,  flex-fuel  vehicles  fueled  with 
gasoline are generally less efficient than nonflex-fuel models because these vehicles 
have to meet a lower fuel efficiency standard than non-flex fuel models. Also, manu-
facturers have generally put this flex-fuel capacity in their larger, less efficient mod-
els.  NHTSA  officials  pointed  out,  however,  that  they  view  this  credit  as  providing 
an incentive to auto manufacturers to bring vehicles to the market that can run on 
E85  and  other  alternative  fuels,  which  would  help  expand  the  infrastructure  to 
make these fuels available to consumers. 

Mr.  Chairman,  this  concludes  my  statement.  I  would  be  pleased  to  answer  any 

questions that you or other Members of the Committee may have at this time. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you. 
What we’ll do is, we’ll start a 7-minute round here. 
And, Ms. Siggerud, what I’d like to do is start with you and ask 
about  your  GAO  study  that,  I  believe,  Senator  Inouye  requested. 
And  I  want  to  thank  him  for  that.  But  in  looking  at  NHTSA  from 
your  perspective,  from  the  GAO’s  perspective,  does  NHTSA  have 
enough expertise in-house to assess the accuracy of the information 
that the automakers provide? 

Ms. SIGGERUD. It’s an important question. And I think if you had 
asked  me  that  question  4  or  5  years  ago,  the  answer  would  be 
somewhat different than it is today because of the prohibition, that 
I  mentioned,  against  changing  the  program.  We  do  believe  that 
NHTSA  needs  to  hire  some  additional  expertise  to  review  the 
project  plans.  NHTSA  does  have  a  proposal  to  hire  one  new  staff 
member.  At  this  point,  we  haven’t  evaluated  whether,  from  our 
view, that is sufficient. 

I also want to point out and emphasize what I said in my state-
ment  that  updating  this  study,  and  having  it  done  by  an  inde-

that they will be put under when it proposes revisions to the stand-
ards. 

Senator  PRYOR.  So,  if  you  have  a  concern  that  NHTSA  may  not 
have  the  expertise  and  resources  necessary  in-house,  do  they  have 
sufficient  resources  and  budget  to  go  outside  to  hire  expertise, 
when necessary? 

Ms. SIGGERUD. NHTSA has proposed funding the National Acad-
emy  of  Sciences  study  in  this—I  believe,  in  the  Fiscal  Year  2008 
budget.  That  is  an  important  step,  and  we  are  fully  supportive  of 
that  concept.  It  also  has  an  ongoing  relationship  with  the  Volpe 
Transportation  Center,  near  Boston,  that  will  need  to  update  the 
model  that  it  runs  in  order  to  revise  the  CAFE  standards  in  the 
way that NHTSA has proposed. 

Senator  PRYOR.  And  right  now  when  NHTSA  collects  monies,  as 

I understand it, it’s about $30 million a year? Do you know? 

Ms. SIGGERUD. Are you talking about in terms of fines? 
Senator PRYOR. Yes. 
Ms. SIGGERUD. I don’t have that number at my—— 
Senator PRYOR. OK. 
Ms. SIGGERUD.—fingertips. 
Senator PRYOR. But, do you know, does that money go to the gen-

eral treasury? Do you know? 

Ms. SIGGERUD. Administrator Nason is saying yes. I didn’t know 

the answer—— 

Senator PRYOR. OK. 
Ms. SIGGERUD.—to that. But apparently that is a yes. 
Senator PRYOR. OK. 
Let me ask the Administrator a couple of questions, as well. The 
President, in his State of the Union, talked about this goal that you 
mentioned  of  ‘‘20  in  10.’’  Could  you,  again,  explain  that  for  the 
Committee, please? 

Ms.  NASON.  Yes,  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  The  ‘‘20  in  10’’  goal 
is  the  President’s  proposal  for  a  20  percent  reduction  in  gasoline 
consumption in—by 2017. The 20 percent, 15 of which would come 
from the alternative and renewable fuels proposal, which is Depart-
ment  of  Energy,  largely,  and  5  percent  of  which  comes  from 
CAFE—increase  in  the  CAFE—in  our  estimate,  as  the  President 
noted,  8.5  billion  gallons  of  gasoline  reduced  in  2017.  In  order  to 
get  there,  you  need  a  4  percent,  roughly,  gradual  increase  from 
2010  to  2017  for  passenger  cars.  That  is  our  proposal,  we  would 
like  to  reform  the  program  while  increasing  the  stringency.  So,  we 
have  two  pieces  that  we’re  asking  for,  from  Congress.  The  one 
would  be  the  authority  to  reform  the  passenger  car  program,  and 
the  second  is  to  increase  it.  We  believe  we  can  do  a  straight  in-
crease,  but  we’d  like  to  reform  the  program  also.  So,  we’d  like  to 
marry the two. 

Senator PRYOR. In your opinion, is the ‘‘20 in 10’’ achievable? 
Ms.  NASON.  Yes.  As  the  President  has  noted,  it’s  a  heavy  tech-
nology  bet.  I  know  the  President  has  been  traveling  around  the 
country, visiting various companies that are, for example, doing en-
zyme  development  to  help  break  down  cellulosic  ethanol  more 
quickly.  For  CAFE  purposes,  for  our  5  percent,  I  think  it  is  fair  to 
say  you  would  expect  to  see,  with  a  goal—a  targeted  goal  of  a  4 
percent  annual  increase—a  far  greater  penetration  in  the  fleet  of

19 

the  more  expensive,  but  more  fuel-efficient,  technologies,  such  as 
hybridization and dieselization. 

Senator PRYOR. And in your conversations with the auto industry 
since  the  State  of  the  Union,  what  has  been  the  response  of  the 
auto industry to the ‘‘20 in 10’’? 

Ms.  NASON.  Well,  I’ve  only  have  conversations  with  them  about 
our 5 percent, about the CAFE, so I can’t speak, necessarily, to the 
view  on  ethanol.  I  know  many  of  the  manufacturers  have  put  out 
press releases announcing that they intend to double their ethanol 
production. So, I can assume there’s some support for that. 

Regarding  the  CAFE  proposal,  we  have  heard,  for  example, 
strong  criticism  against  credit  trading.  There  has  been  some  con-
cern  regarding  our  credit  trading  proposal.  We  offered  it  up  as  an 
alternative  flexibility  for  the  manufacturers,  and  some  of  them 
have  said  they  would  not  be  interested  in  that.  It  would  be  vol-
untary, so we think we can address that concern. 

I  think,  overall,  and  I  know  you  have  members  representing  the 
manufacturing  sector,  so  I  don’t  want  to  speak  for  all  of  them,  be-
cause  we  haven’t  received  a  straight—a  clear  answer  from  overall 
automotive  industry,  where  they  are.  Some  are  more  supportive 
than others. Some have raised concerns about some pieces of it. So, 
I think, generally, we think we can work with the industry regard-
ing reform. And then, there have been concerns about other pieces 
of the proposal, that we’d be happy to work with Congress on. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you. 
Chairman Inouye? 
The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much. 
The  administration  has  made  it  very  clear  that  it  wants  the  au-
thority to set the standards. The last time it did so, on light trucks, 
it  was  1.5  miles  per  gallon  over  3  years.  And  now,  you’re  asking 
for—in this most recent case—1.8 miles per gallon, which is a little 
worse than that. Do you believe you can really set this new stand-
ard with that record? 

Ms. NASON. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. One of the most im-
portant  things  we  believe  we  did  with  the  light  truck  rule  was  re-
form the program so that it’s very different from traditional CAFE. 
And  we  had,  I  believe,  a  2  percent—under  the  light  truck  rule— 
annual  increase.  The  goal  for  this  proposal,  for  the  ‘‘20  in  10,’’ 
would  be  a  4  percent  increase.  I  certainly  acknowledge  it’s  a  very 
aggressive  proposal.  But  we’ve  asked  for  product  plans  from  the 
manufacturers.  I  think—we  believe  we  will  see  a  greater  improve-
ment  in  the  fuel  efficiency  just  in  the  product  plans  that  we  will 
see. And then, we will build from there and include new fuel-saving 
technologies. 

The CHAIRMAN. I’m interested in the GAO report that noted that 
the  ‘‘statistical  cost-benefit  analysis  model  [your]  agency  uses  does 
not fully account for the impact of greenhouse gas emissions in the 
computer  model  used  to  set  a  CAFE  level.’’  Experts  note  that  the 
benefits of reducing greenhouse gas could be as much as $50 billion 
by 2020. But these benefits are virtually ignored in the cost-benefit 
analysis of your light truck rule. Is there any credence to this criti-
cism by GAO? 

Ms.  NASON.  Yes,  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  We  have  heard  the 
concern, and we understand the concern, about monetizing CO2 re-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  08:33 Apr 16, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\80088.TXT JACKIE

20 

duction. In the light truck rule, for example, we were able to quan-
tify that we were reducing 73 million metric tons of CO2. The ques-
tion  then  becomes,  how  do  you  place  a  value  on  that?  And  we 
looked at it. The agency looked at it when they were performing— 
when  they  were  doing  the  light  truck  rule.  And  there’s  such  a  dis-
parity  right  now  in  the  scientific  community  about  how  to  value 
CO2—I’ve  seen  as  low  as  negative  1  to  negative  3  and  as  high  as 
$1,600  a  ton—that  they  made  a  determination  during  the  light 
truck rulemaking, it was too difficult to try to monetize. One of the 
things I think GAO has suggested, or will suggest when the report 
is  final,  is  perhaps  looking  at  a  range.  Instead  of  trying  to  deter-
mine  an  actual  number,  we  could  look  at  a  range.  That  is  some-
thing  that  we  considered  last  time.  The  range  was  too  broad.  I 
think  we’d  certainly  be  willing  to  look  at  it  again  to  see  if  there’s 
consensus in the scientific community. 

The CHAIRMAN. What does GAO say about this? 
Ms.  SIGGERUD.  We  think  that  if  the  car  standards  are  reformed 
in  the  way  that  your  legislation  or  the  administration  has  pro-
posed,  that  it  is  important  to  revise  that  model  to  include  green-
house  gas  emissions  in  some  way.  If  the  administration  is  not 
ready,  or  cannot  discern  a  consensus  value  at  that  time,  a  range 
would  certainly  be  appropriate.  But  the  time  is  here  to  move  for-
ward on including that information in some way in the model. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Do  you  believe  that  the  administration  will  be 

able to respond to this—raising CAFE standards in this bill? 

Ms.  SIGGERUD.  Are  you  referring  to  the  bill  that  you  sponsored, 

Senator Inouye? 

The CHAIRMAN. Yes. 
Ms.  SIGGERUD.  Because  the  administration  has  developed  an  at-
tribute-based concept already for the light truck model, it has a bit 
of  a  headstart  from  where  it  would  have  been  without  doing  that. 
So,  we  think  that,  if  that  is  the  model  that  is  approached,  that 
NHTSA can move forward fairly quickly, in terms of getting the in-
formation it needs into its modeling. And also, we feel it’s very im-
portant to get this National Academy of Sciences study updated. 

Nevertheless, this will be a several year process to get that study 
updated,  to  revise  the  model,  to  get  out  the  proposed  rule  and  get 
the comments. The last rule, the light truck rule, there were 45,000 
comments to respond to. So, I think we’re looking at a several year 
approach here before a final rule can be in place. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Is  there  anything  you  can  suggest  to  this  com-
mittee  on  how  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  passenger  cars?  You’re 
the expert. 

Ms. SIGGERUD. Well, I’m not an engineer, but we have been talk-
ing  to  a  lot  of  engineers  in  doing  our  work.  There  is  a  consensus 
out  there,  in  the  industry  and  in  those  who  study  the  industry, 
that  it  is  possible  to  improve  the  fuel  efficiency  of  passenger  cars. 
It has been static for 20 years. There are technologies on the hori-
zon  that  will  allow  for  potentially  significant  increases  over  the 
next  10  years.  There  are  a  number  of—there  are  new  diesel  fuels 
available.  When  the  study  was  done  in  2002  on  this  issue,  the— 
I  think  the  extent  that  the  hybrids  would  be  available  was  not  in-
cluded  in  that  study,  or  not  really  anticipated.  So,  there  are  tech-

nologies  out  there  that  will  allow,  over  the  next  10  years,  the  pas-
senger car fuel economy standards and performance to improve. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  The  events  of  the  last  several  months,  plus  the 
statistics that indicate that in the 1970s General Motors, Ford, and 
Chrysler  sold  nine  out  of  every  ten  cars  in  the  United  States,  and 
today  Toyota  will  be  number  one,  above  GM.  These  numbers  and 
statistics frighten us, and we’re not certain whether this bill is suf-
ficient or insufficient. We hope we can work with you. 

Thank you very much. 
Senator PRYOR. Vice Chairman Stevens? 

STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKS 

Senator  STEVENS.  Mr.  Chairman,  please  print  my  statement  in 

full. At this point, I’ll just summarize it a little bit. 

I  do  believe  that  this  is  one  of  the  most  serious  issues  we  face, 
in terms of the energy crisis. The question of how to reduce our de-
pendence  on  foreign  oil  has  to  be  paramount,  in  my  opinion.  And 
I  applaud  the  President  for  looking  at  a  combination  of  initiatives, 
including  conservation,  domestic  production,  and  alternative 
sources of energy. 

I  introduced,  at  the  beginning  of  this  Congress,  S.  183,  the  Im-
proved  Passenger  Automobile  Fuel  Economy  Act,  which  would  set 
the goal at a minimum of 40 miles per gallon by 2017. And it’s my 
feeling,  Ms.  Nason,  that  we  ought  to  set  out  to  do  what  President 
Reagan  did,  set  the  goals  out  further,  and  hope  people  will  go  to-
ward  achieving  them,  and  give  some  discretion  to  the  industry,  if 
it’s  needed,  later.  But  the  goals  ought  to  be  very  firm  right  now. 
And  let  me  just  say  this,  Ms.  Nason,  the  claim  was  made  by  at 
least  one  manufacturer  in  the  mid-1970s  that  the  original  CAFE 
standards  were  set  so  that  only  pint-sized  cars  would  be  able  to 
make the 27.5 mile-per-gallon standard by 1985, as required by the 
statute. But the automobile industry met and exceeded that stand-
ard  now,  and  fuel-efficiency  gains  have  led  to  enhanced  power, 
rather than fuel economy. Now, Ms. Nason, in setting CAFE stand-
ards,  how  does  NHTSA  strike  the  balance  between  furthering  the 
public  goals  of  CAFE  with  the  competitive  need  of  the  manufac-
turer  to  produce  a  product  with  performance  that  will  be  market-
able  to  consumers?  Aren’t  consumers  looking  for  more  power,  de-
spite the fact we’re setting higher mileage standards? 

Ms.  NASON.  Thank  you,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens.  The  challenge 
that  we  face  under  a  Reformed  CAFE  proposal  is  to  try  to  see  an 
increase  in  fuel  efficiency  from  all  manufacturers.  Some  manufac-
turers may have to do much more than others. There may be some 
that  are  already  exceeding  the  standards,  and,  under  a  rule-
making—for example, for a light truck rulemaking, there are some 
manufacturers who are already beyond where we’re going. But our 
overall goal is to get as much fuel savings as possible from the pro-
gram if we were to have a reform. 

So,  we  would  do  a  balancing,  a  weighing,  of  technological  feasi-
bility  and  economic  practicability.  One  of  our  basic  policy  tenets 
would be to be technology neutral. As the GAO noted, we really do 
need  to  update  the  study  that  was  done  by  the  National  Academy 
of Sciences, because, at the time, hybrids and diesels were very cut-

22 

ting-edge, there were one or two on the market, and that is the bot-
tom  of  the—or  the  top,  maybe,  of  the  technology  list  for  the  NAS. 
We  need  to  find  a  way  to  show  the  manufacturers  that  it  is  fea-
sible,  there  is  a  path,  using  technology.  And  we  believe  there  are 
still  gains  to  be  made,  even  making  changes  to  the  good  old  inter-
nal  combustion  engine—again,  also  seeing  an  increase  in  hybrids 
and  diesels.  The  manufacturers  can  then  look  at  our  path  and  de-
cide that is not how they would like to go. They want to make their 
own  changes,  they’d  like  to  go  more  towards  direct  injection,  or 
they  want  to  go  more  toward  dieselization.  Some  of  the  manufac-
turers  are  looking  more  aggressively  at  diesels.  We  leave  it  open 
to them. 

What  we  need  to  do  in  a  rulemaking  is  to  demonstrate  to  them 
that it is technologically feasible to get this increase, to show them 
that  it’s  possible,  still  balancing  economic  practicability,  and  then 
we allow them to choose which technologies they would like to use 
to  get  there.  So,  we  try  not  to  do  anything  that  would  reduce  con-
sumer  choice.  We’ll  just  show  the  manufacturers  there  is  a  way, 
but, when they look at their own product plans, when they’re mak-
ing  determinations  about  who  their  customers  are  and  what  their 
customers want to buy, they can decide for themselves which tech-
nologies they choose to apply. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  should  we  include  some  limitation  on 
power?  Senator  Inouye  and  I  came  out  of  the  generation  where  a 
Ford  V8  that  had  85  horsepower  was  considered  good  enough  for 
us. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  STEVENS.  Why  do  we  have  to  have  this  race  for  power? 
Ms.  NASON.  There  is—you’re  absolutely  right,  Senator  Stevens. 
When  you  look  at  the  distinction  between  fuel  efficiency  for  some 
of the cars of a particular class—and we would be doing an overall 
attribute-based  reform,  so,  by  weight  or  by  size—you  see  that  you 
can  get  nearly  the  same  fuel  efficiency  from  a  Toyota  Avalon  or  a 
Chevy Impala, for example. But then, when you change the engine 
size, and you see some vehicles within that class that have a larger 
engine—a  Chrysler  300,  maybe,  with  a  6.1-liter  engine  is  going  to 
get  worse  fuel  efficiency.  The  manufacturers,  we  believe,  have  de-
termined that there is interest on the part of consumers in having 
the  larger  engines,  and,  when  they  are  doing  their  product  plans, 
as long as we can show them a path that is technologically achiev-
able,  they  can  make  the  decisions  about  whether  or  not  they  want 
to  change  their  engine  sizes.  We  don’t  want  to  do  anything  in  a 
rulemaking—at  least  NHTSA  doesn’t—that  would  prohibit  an  en-
gine size. Some consumers feel very strongly that they need a larg-
er engine, for a variety of reasons. And we don’t want to eliminate 
that possibility. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  it  seems  to  me  as  long  as  you  take  that 

position, you’re never going to achieve the CAFE standards. 

Thank you very much. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Stevens follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Mr. Chairman, thank you for calling this important hearing, and I thank the wit-

nesses for their willingness to appear. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  08:33 Apr 16, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80088.TXT JACKIE

The issue of fuel economy of our cars and light trucks is significant as our country 
faces an energy crisis. The September 11 terrorist attacks and the current struggles 
in  the  Middle  East  have  brought  into  focus  the  need  to  reduce  our  dependence  on 
foreign  oil.  But  addressing  this  problem  will  require  a  combination  of  initiatives. 
Conservation,  domestic  production,  and  the  development  of  alternative  energy 
sources are all part of the solution. 

In January, I introduced legislation that would address conservation, and with it, 
a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions—as the impacts of climate change are more 
evident in Alaska than anywhere in the country. 

The  Bill,  S.  183,  the  Improved  Passenger  Automobile  Fuel  Economy  Act,  would 
make  clear  the  Department  of  Transportation’s  authority  to  reform  fuel  economy 
standards  for  passenger  cars,  and  require  that  the  domestic  passenger  car  fleet 
achieve a minimum fuel economy of 40 miles per gallon by model year 2017. 

However, the legislation does not contemplate an increase in fuel economy stand-
ards  for  light  trucks  given  the  recent  reforms  made  by  the  Secretary  of  Transpor-
tation to the light truck CAFE program. I applaud the Secretary for taking that ac-
tion,  and  believe  that  Congress  should  allow  the  reformed  program  to  take  effect 
before taking more action. 

While  I  am  fully  aware  of  the  aggressiveness  of  the  target  standard  set  forth  in 
S.  183,  it  is  designed  to  begin  a  discussion  that  I  look  forward  to  having  with  the 
Chairman,  and  the  rest  of  the  Committee,  as  we  develop  a  thoughtful  bipartisan 
product. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you. And let me also remind staff that all 
Senators’  statements  will  be  made  part  of  the  record,  and  we’ll 
leave  the  record  open  for  2  weeks  for  Senators  to  ask  questions  in 
writing. 

STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA 

Senator DORGAN. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. 
This—I  understand  the  point  you’re  making  about  consumer 
choice.  I  was  thinking,  whenever  I  pull  up  to  a  red  light  next  to 
someone  driving  a  Hummer  or  a  humvee,  I  think  of  the  broken 
Latin—since  Latin  wasn’t  taught  in  a  high  school  class  of  nine— 
I think of broken Latin, totus porcus—— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  DORGAN.—which,  in  my  hometown,  roughly  translated, 

means ‘‘whole hog.’’ 

You  know,  there’s  this  old  saying,  ‘‘If  you  don’t  care  where  you 
are,  you’re  never  going  to  be  lost.’’  You’ve  got  to—it  seems  to  me 
you have to set goals, set way-points, set destinations, and then get 
there.  And  I  don’t—I  guess  I  don’t  quite  understand  the—the  ad-
ministration,  at  this  point,  is  saying  they  want  greater  automobile 
efficiency.  And  that’s  certainly  something  we  should  aspire  to 
achieve.  It’s  been  20  or  25  years  with  no  change.  And,  in  fact,  to 
whatever  extent  there  has  been  a  change  in  efficiency,  it’s  been 
converted  into  weight  and  power.  And  so,  if  you  look  at  a  car  that 
you purchased 10 years ago, and then the equivalent vehicle today, 
you’ll  see  that  there’s  no  difference  in  the  mileage  standards  on 
those vehicles, by and large. We just did that with a car, and—so— 
but  the  seller  of  that  car  would  say,  ‘‘Yes,  but  it’s  more  efficient, 
because  this  is  a  heavier  car  with  a  bigger  engine.’’  So,  that’s  the 
point. 

And  I  guess  I  have,  in  the  past  been  satisfied  with  leaving  this 
to the scientific inquiry at NHTSA and so on, so forth. I’ve—I’m not 
going  to  do  that  anymore.  I  think  it’s  important  for  us  to  have  en-
forceable CAFE standards. We don’t have any choice. And the only 
way we’re going to get to this point is to force the issue.

The thing I don’t understand, and perhaps someone can describe 
it  for  me,  is,  everything  in  a—in  the  vehicles  these  days  has  been 
the  subject  of  breathtaking  change—absolutely  breathtaking—ex-
cept  there  have  not  been  quantum  leaps  in  efficiency.  And  I  don’t 
understand why, for 20–25 years, we’ve had very little change with 
respect to efficiency. 

Ms. Nason, can you tell me why that’s the case? 
Ms.  NASON.  Again,  Senator  Dorgan,  I  don’t  want  to  speak,  nec-
essarily, for the manufacturers. We regulate them; I don’t speak for 
them. But I think when—a good example is the National Academy 
of  Sciences’  study  that  they  did  5  years  ago,  maybe  6  years  ago— 
they  were  looking  at  the  technologies,  and  there  have  been  dra-
matic  breakthroughs  just  in  the  last  5  to  10  years.  I  think  there 
was—there’s certainly an increase in curb weight, if you look at the 
weight of vehicles in the 1970s, and they essentially went on a diet, 
and  then  they  got  heavier  again.  We  do  have  a  concern  with 
downsizing.  There  is,  as  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  noted, 
a  safety  penalty  if  manufacturers  simply  choose  to  downsize  their 
vehicles, rather than increase technology to make the vehicles more 
fuel-efficient. So, I think we share that goal with you. And I under-
stand—we  differ  in  how  we  might  get  there.  But  our  overall  goal 
is to have new fuel-efficient technologies apply to the vehicles rath-
er  than  making  changes  simply  to  the  weight  of  the  vehicle  as  a 
way  to  increase  the  fuel  efficiency.  So,  I  do  think  we  have  agree-
ment on that point. 

Senator  DORGAN.  But  the  technology  changes  in  virtually  every 
other  part  of  the  vehicle  are  just  breathtaking.  I  mean,  it’s  almost 
unbelievable.  And  yet,  that  same  technology  has  not  been  brought 
to  bear  with  respect  to  efficiency,  and  that’s  the  point  I  don’t  un-
derstand. 

Again, the question, I think, for the Congress is, do we just keep 
going  here,  saying,  ‘‘Well,  whatever  the  manufacturers  decide  to 
produce,  whatever  consumer  choice,  that’s  just  the  way  it  works,’’ 
or do you say, ‘‘In order for us to deal with this question of the un-
believable  dependence  on  foreign  oil,  and  the  increasing  depend-
ence on foreign oil, we have to set some enforceable standards’’? Is 
the  administration—is  it  your  testimony  that  the  administration 
will  oppose,  and  continue  to  impose,  enforceable  CAFE  standards? 

Ms. NASON. No, Senator Dorgan. 
Senator DORGAN. OK. 
Ms. NASON. We enforce CAFE compliance right now. 
Senator DORGAN. No, I’m talking about setting new CAFE stand-

ards and—— 

Ms. NASON. Oh, you mean if—— 
Senator DORGAN. Yes. 
Ms. NASON. I’m sorry. If the—— 
Senator DORGAN. I understand you—— 
Ms.  NASON.—Senate  were  to  choose  a  number,  it  would  be  our 

preference to have the authority to reform the program, overall. 

Senator  DORGAN.  But  if  the  Congress  decides  to  increase  CAFE 
standards and say, ‘‘You know, we’re going to have to bite the bul-
let  here.  It’s  been  20  years.  We  have  more  cars  on  the  road.  The 
average  efficiency  is  still  what  it  was  20–25  years  ago.’’  Will  the

President  sign  legislation  that  the  Congress  determines  it  wishes 
to pursue, that would mandate increases in CAFE standards? 

Ms. NASON. I think, from this table today, Senator, I can tell you 
that we would very much like to work with you to find ways to im-
prove  our  draft  legislation.  If  the  Congress  isn’t  comfortable, 
maybe,  with  the  ‘‘trust  us’’  message,  which  is  part  of  what  we 
heard last year when Secretary Mineta was testifying—we’ve heard 
concerns  about  backsliding,  for  example,  that  there  needs  to  be 
some  sort  of  floor.  We’ve  heard  concerns  about  what  is  achievable. 
We  need  to  have  a  ceiling.  We  would  like  the  authority  to  reform 
the  program.  It  becomes  much  more  challenging  for  the  agency  to 
reform  if  there’s  a  floor  and  a  ceiling,  because  we’re  essentially  di-
rected  in  where  to  go.  But  I’m  certainly  not  prepared  to  issue  a 
veto threat from—that is the President’s, alone. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Ms.  Siggerud,  let  me  just,  finally,  ask—while 
I think there needs to be, now, enforceable new standards with re-
spect to CAFE, and I hope the Congress will do that, it also seems 
to me, as I’ve looked at this issue, that American automakers, over 
the  several  decades,  have  been  disadvantaged  because  of  the  fleet 
mix with respect to U.S. domestic automakers versus foreign auto-
makers. Is that the case? And can you describe that for me? 

Ms.  SIGGERUD.  Well,  yes,  that  is  the  case.  Those  manufacturers 
that make a full line, from small to large, heavy vehicles, have in-
curred  more  cost  in  responding  to  the  CAFE  standards  since  they 
were enacted in the 1970s. However, a number of the stakeholders 
we’ve  spoken  with  on  this  issue  viewed  the  recent  reform—to  use 
this attribute concept for the light trucks—as being somewhat miti-
gating  of  that  issue,  and  spreading,  shall  we  say,  the  cost  or  the 
impact somewhat more equitably across foreign and domestic auto-
makers  than  we  have  seen  with  just  a  single  average  standard 
that—as  has  been  used  in  the  past.  I  would  also  like  to  say  that 
I think there probably is a compromise to be reached here between 
a  standard  set  by  the  Congress  and  allowing  the  administration 
some  flexibility  to  study  the  technology  and  make  recommenda-
tions,  in  terms  of  what  the  appropriate  increase  in  standards  is 
over time. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Well,  I  think  all  of  us  look  for  opportunities  to 
find  ways  to  have  an  effective  standard  here.  But  we’ve  been  talk-
ing,  now,  for  the  last  4  or  5  years,  and,  as  we’ve  talked,  nothing 
has  changed.  And  I  think  most  people  in  Congress  are  becoming 
anxious about that and want to see some action. 

Thank you very much. 
Senator PRYOR. Senator Sununu? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN E. SUNUNU, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE 

Senator SUNUNU. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  note  that  Senator  Stevens  observed  that  85  horsepower  in  a 
Ford  was  always  good  enough  for  him,  and  I  absolutely  believe 
that.  But  I  would  be  remiss  if  I  didn’t  point  out  that  it  was  also 
members of his generation that turned 45 in 1967 and gave us the 
427 and the GTO. So, there’s always——

Senator  SUNUNU.—a  tradeoff  to  be  made  with  the  preference  of 

the great consumer. 

Ms.  Nason,  I  want  to  hear  you  talk  a  little  bit  more  about  the 
new  light  truck  standard,  because—and  I  don’t  have  strong  opin-
ions  about  whether  it’s  the  right  approach  or  the  wrong  approach, 
but  it’s  obviously  a  change.  And  I  want  to  understand  how  signifi-
cant a change it is, and whether it will result in continued increase 
in  performance  and  fuel  efficiency  standards.  We  all  know  that  no 
new standards had been set for a number of years. And I think this 
is really the first rulemaking that raised standards significantly in 
the last few years. 

Currently,  for  the  light  trucks,  what  is  the  fuel  efficiency  stand-

ard, for model year 2007? 

we—and we end at 24 in—— 

Ms.  NASON.  I  believe  it’s  22.2.  We  started  at  20.7  in  2004,  and 

Senator SUNUNU. OK. 
Ms. NASON.—2011. 
Senator  SUNUNU.  So,  between  2007  and  2011,  you  increase  the 

fleet fuel efficiency standard every year. 

Ms.  NASON.  Yes,  the  reform  takes  place  starting  in  2008,  from 
2008 to 2011. The new CAFE—one of the issues that we have cur-
rently  in  litigation,  Senator,  is  whether  we  should  have  given  the 
manufacturers  a  choice.  We  allowed  them  to  opt  in  or  out  to  the 
reform proposal—— 

Senator SUNUNU. For model years—— 
Ms. NASON.—for 3 years, right. 
Senator SUNUNU.—2008 to 2011. 
Ms. NASON. Yes. 
Senator  SUNUNU.  But  after  2011,  everyone  has  to  comply  with 

the new vehicle footprint—— 

Ms. NASON. Yes, sir. 
Senator SUNUNU.—standards. 
Ms. NASON. That’s correct, Senator. 
Senator  SUNUNU.  And  then,  after  that  time,  the  way  that  im-
provements  in  the  fuel  efficiency  will  be  implemented  is  to  take 
that vehicle footprint—— 

Ms. NASON. Correct. 
Senator SUNUNU.—standard, and continue to move it in the right 

direction, so that—— 
Ms. NASON. Correct. 
Senator  SUNUNU.—the  overall  fuel  efficiency  of  any  vehicle  at 

any footprint has to be improved each year, correct? 

Ms. NASON. Exactly. 
Senator SUNUNU. OK. 
Ms. NASON. So, it—— 
Senator  SUNUNU.  You  also  got  rid  of  the  two-fleet  rule  for  light 

trucks, is that correct? 

several years ago. 

Ms.  NASON.  The  two-fleet  rule  was  eliminated  for  light  trucks 

Senator SUNUNU. OK. 
Ms. NASON. It as—this was not part of this rulemaking. 
Senator  SUNUNU.  What’s  the  value  of  that?  Is  there  a  value  to 
that?  Looking  back  over  the  years  that  it  has  been  eliminated, 
what benefits do you think that provided?

27 

Ms.  NASON.  I  think  when  NHTSA  eliminated  the  two-fleet  rule 
several  years  ago,  it  was  because  less  than  1  percent  of  the  light 
trucks were being imported. It essentially eliminated itself by deci-
sions regarding production. We did not propose changes to the two- 
fleet rule in the passenger car reform proposal. We know that there 
is  some  interest  in  having  conversations  about  two-fleet.  When  we 
were  looking  at  sending  draft  legislation  to  the  Congress,  to  be 
frank,  Senator  we  looked  at  those  provisions,  those  places  where 
we could save fuel. This was not a fuel-saving—— 

Senator SUNUNU. Fine. 
Ms. NASON.—issue. 
Senator  SUNUNU.  I  appreciate  that.  So,  it  wasn’t  a  useful  rule, 
we  got  rid  of  it,  which  is  actually  very  refreshing.  We  probably 
don’t do quite enough of that in Congress. 

You  made  the  point,  or  made  the  claim,  that  the  curve  prevents 
companies,  manufacturers,  from  simply  meeting  the  fuel-efficiency 
standard  now  by  downsizing.  And  as  I  look  at  these  curves,  what 
that means—what I think that means—is that because a vehicle of 
a  particular  size  now  has  to  meet  a  particular  standard,  if  they 
want to look good by improving their vehicle fleet fuel performance, 
they can’t just reduce the size of the car, because if they reduce the 
size  of  the  car,  they  have  to  meet  an  even  higher  performance.  Is 
that correct? 

Ms. NASON. That’s correct. 
Senator SUNUNU. So, that’s—— 
Ms. NASON. They would shift from—— 
Senator  SUNUNU.—the  disincentive  to  downsizing  simply  in  an 

effort to meet the regulation. 

Ms. NASON. Yes. 
Senator  SUNUNU.  And  each  year  the  performance  standard  for 
every  vehicle  at  every  size,  including  the  Hummer,  will  be  in-
creased, correct? 

Ms.  NASON.  Right,  by  having  new  technologies  added,  new  fuel- 

efficient technologies. 

Senator SUNUNU. Was there something you wanted to add? 
Ms.  NASON.  We  did  hear  some  concerns  about  reform,  just  to 
be—as long as we’re discussing the issue—about creating an incen-
tive  to  upsize,  however;  that  if  you  look  at  that  curve,  if  you  look 
at  the  fact  that  a  larger  vehicle  would  have  a  lower  fuel-efficiency 
target  for  that  class,  that  size,  or  that  weight  vehicle,  that  there 
would  be  an  incentive  to  go  the  other  way,  to  upsize.  And  we  dis-
agree  that  there  is  an  incentive.  There’s  certainly  no  financial  in-
centive. It’s not as if we give a bonus or a credit if you upsize. But 
it  would  be,  again,  up  to  the  manufacturers  and  how  they  would 
choose  to  set  their  vehicle  fleet.  And  when  you  look  at  just  what 
happened  last  year  to  the  light—larger  light  trucks,  I  think  most 
manufacturers are looking to manufacture vehicles that consumers 
want  to  buy.  They  don’t  manufacture  vehicles  based  on  CAFE,  as 
far as we can ever tell in the history of the program. 

Senator  SUNUNU.  That’s  an  interesting  assertion.  I  don’t  know 
whether that’s true or not. I look at it, and, while I understand the 
argument that someone might make, that there’s now less of a pen-
alty for upsizing—— 
Ms. NASON. Right.

28 

Senator  SUNUNU.—because  you  know  where  you  need  to  fit  on 
the curve, from a regulatory perspective, I think this makes it a lot 
easier  for  either  Congress  or  the  regulator  to  penalize  a  particular 
manufacturer  of  a  particular  size  of  car,  because  all  I  have  to  do 
now  is  raise  the  right-hand  edge  of  that  curve  for  larger  vehicles. 
You  can  just  push  up  fuel  efficiency  requirements  on  that  side, 
and create huge disincentives to manufacture that car if it can’t be 
done economically, if they can’t meet the fuel standard. Today, the 
only lever a regulator has is to increase the average fleet—— 

Ms. NASON. Right. 
Senator  SUNUNU.—efficiency,  which  doesn’t  necessarily  penalize 
anyone  who’s  making  large  cars,  as  long  as  they’re  also  making 
small cars. 

Ms. NASON. Correct. 
Senator  SUNUNU.  Under  the  footprint,  if  you  want  to  really  pe-
nalize the manufacturer of a large car, you know exactly what part 
of the curve, what part of the performance curve, you need to push 
up,  and  so,  you  just  change  the  shape  of  the  curve,  and  make  it 
economically  nonfeasible  for  someone  to  manufacture  a  car  of  a 
particular size. You could do the same at the smaller footprint size. 
I  understand  you’re  a  regulator,  and  you  take  your  job  seriously, 
but it’s basically a very effective tool for aggressively manipulating 
the vehicle footprint on the road. 

That’s an observation, you don’t have to comment—— 
Ms. NASON. Yes, sir. 
Senator SUNUNU.—on that. 
Ms. NASON. I won’t. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  SUNUNU.  And  I  suppose  there  may  be  some  people  who 
are  getting  ideas,  who  I  don’t  necessarily  want  to  give  ideas  to, 
but—— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator SUNUNU.—I think honesty is always the best policy. 
All  right.  Finally,  one  observation  that  you  made  in  your  testi-
mony was that there are—two things—one, there are vehicles that 
are  now  covered  under  this  light  truck  standard  that  previously 
weren’t covered by—— 

Ms. NASON. Yes. 
Senator  SUNUNU.—fuel  economy  standards.  And,  two,  that  there 
are  some  light  trucks  that  have  been  brought  to  a  level  that  cur-
rently  exceeds  the  overall  passenger  car  standard  of  27.5  miles  to 
a gallon. Could you expand on both of those points? 

Ms. NASON. Yes, Senator, thank you. 
The MDPV, the 8,500- to 10,000-pound vehicles have never been 
regulated  before.  We  included  those  vehicles  when  we  look  at— 
again, it’s consumer choice—there has obviously been a great explo-
sion in these—— 

Senator  SUNUNU.  The  vehicles  between  8,500  and  10,000 

pounds—— 

Ms. NASON. Less than 10,000. 
Senator SUNUNU.—previously were not covered by any—— 
Ms. NASON. Correct. 
Senator SUNUNU.—fuel economy standard, and they are now cov-

ered by this light truck curve.

29 

Ms.  NASON.  Not  all  of  them.  We  include  what  we  refer  to  as 
MDPVs,  the  medium  duty  passenger  vehicle.  So,  not  the  largest 
work  trucks,  the  largest  pickup  trucks,  F–650  for  example,  that 
people  are  using  back  and  forth  to  construction  sites,  or  wherever 
they  need  them  for  work,  but  the  larger  vehicles  that  people  are 
using  to  essentially  drive  around  town.  They’re  using  them  mostly 
as a passenger vehicle, and we’ve included those. So, it’s essentially 
super  large  pickup  trucks  that  were  not  included.  Everything  else 
is included. 

Senator SUNUNU. And cars that are—— 
Ms. NASON. And what was your question on—— 
Senator SUNUNU.—cars that are exceeding the standard? 
Ms. NASON. Well, there are. 
Senator SUNUNU. OK. 
Ms.  NASON.  And  we—you  know,  when  you  look  at  27.5  you’re 
going to see some manufacturers who are above it and some manu-
facturers  who  are  below  it.  You’ve  got  specialty  manufacturers,  for 
example, who would be way below it. But there are some manufac-
turers  under  our  first—under  the  light  truck  rule,  if  that’s  what 
you’re asking about, who are already—— 

Senator SUNUNU. I—— 
Ms. NASON.—at the—— 
Senator  SUNUNU.  I’m  over  my  time.  I  apologize,  Mr.  Chairman. 

One final question, though. 

Am  I  correct  that  we  can  take  this  curve,  look  at  the  number  of 
cars  that  are  manufactured,  and  calculate,  sort  of,  an  implied  na-
tional light truck fleet efficiency standard, correct? 

Ms. NASON. We can still do an overall CAFE number—— 
Senator  SUNUNU.  Congress  could,  if  we  wanted  to,  legislate  that 
overall  standard  for  2015  or  2020  or  2025,  but  still  allow  that  to 
be  met  using  this  approach.  Is  there  an  inconsistency  there?  I  un-
derstand  it  might  not  be  the  administration’s  preference,  but  that 
could be done, could it not? 

Ms.  NASON.  We  do  think  there  is  a  way  for  us  to  compromise 
with  Congress,  understanding  that  there  is  concern  about  needing 
an  increase  and  not  having  backsliding,  but  still  having  reform.  It 
would just need to be written carefully, but, yes, we think—— 

Senator SUNUNU. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator PRYOR. Senator Smith? 

STATEMENT OF HON. GORDON H. SMITH, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON 

Senator SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Ms. Siggerud, it seems to me that in Europe and in much of Asia, 
even  China,  they  have  fuel-efficiency  levels  that  exceed  ours.  Is 
there something that we can learn from them? What are they doing 
that we’re not doing? 

Ms. SIGGERUD. Sure. 
Senator  SMITH.  And,  by  the  way,  you  can  get  the  same  vehicles 

there as you get here, but they meet the standards abroad. 

Ms. SIGGERUD. To a great extent, yes. 
Senator SMITH. OK. 
Ms.  SIGGERUD.  The  Chinese  standards  are  just—frankly,  just 
being  developed  now.  And  so,  we  don’t  have  a  lot  of  observations

there as to how effective they are or exactly how they are working, 
though, looking at Europe, what you have there is really a fuel effi-
ciency standard that has been legislated through fuel taxes. Essen-
tially,  the  fuel  tax,  as  well  as  some  European  countries  have 
changed  the  level  of  sales  tax,  depending  on  the  fuel  efficiency  of 
a  car,  as  well,  to  provide  consumers  incentives  to  buy  more  fuel- 
efficient vehicles. 

Senator SMITH. So, they don’t do it like we do? 
Ms. SIGGERUD. Right. 
Senator SMITH. I see. 
Ms.  SIGGERUD.  The  European  community  now  has  a  voluntary 
standard, but is considering a compulsory standard that is focused 
more on the greenhouse gas issue than on the fuel economy stand-
ard itself. 

Senator SMITH. But whether it’s driven by tax policy or by CAFE 

policy, they’re meeting much higher standards. 

Ms. SIGGERUD. Yes. 
Senator  SMITH.  That  seems  to  put  in  question  claims  that  cur-
rent U.S. standards are as high as they can possibly be without af-
fecting the kind of choices consumers get and the safety they enjoy. 
Ms.  SIGGERUD.  Yes.  I  guess  I  wouldn’t  say  the  standards  are  as 
high  as  they  could  possibly  be.  That’s  why  we’re  having  this  hear-
ing  today.  And  I  think  that,  for  passenger  car  vehicles,  they  cer-
tainly could be higher, as proposed both by the administration and 
by Members of Congress. I think what’s important to keep in mind, 
though, that you’ve raised here, is that CAFE is, sort of, one piece 
of  what  could  be  a  several-piece  puzzle.  CAFE  does  focus  on  the 
supply of vehicles and try to provide manufacturers an incentive to 
manufacture more fuel-efficient vehicles over time. There is the de-
mand side, as well. And you’ve mentioned that in Europe there are 
various tax policies that one could implement to provide incentives 
for consumers, as well. 

Senator  SMITH.  Did  you  find  that  NHTSA,  when  they  admitted 
to  needing  additional  expertise,  that  they  became  more  conserv-
ative or more aggressive in the administration of CAFE standards? 
Ms.  SIGGERUD.  Well,  as  you  know,  NHTSA  was  not  able  to  do 
anything  with  CAFE  standards  until  Fiscal  Year  2002.  When  it 
was  allowed  to  start  to  make  some  changes,  in  fact,  it  did  become 
more  aggressive,  and  proposed  a  new  light  truck  standard  that 
we’ve been talking about today. 

Senator SMITH. Ms. Nason, we have separate standards for vehi-
cles  and  light  duty  trucks  and  for  domestic  and  imported  fleets, 
isn’t that correct? 
Ms. NASON. Yes. 
Senator  SMITH.  But,  by  law,  a  vehicle  is  considered  a  domestic 
vehicle  if  at  least  75  percent  of  the  cost  of  the  vehicle  is  attrib-
utable to the value added in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. 

Ms. NASON. That’s correct, Senator Smith. 
Senator  SMITH.  So,  how  much  of  meeting  CAFE  standards  be-
comes  just  a  numbers  game,  where  manufacturers  make  modifica-
tions  to  move  a  vehicle  from  its  passenger  vehicle  line  to  its  light 
truck fleet or from its foreign to its domestic fleet? Is it just a num-
bers game?

Ms.  NASON.  I  think—and  certainly  the  National  Academy  of 
Sciences, even, has noted the least expensive way to meet a CAFE 
increase  is  to  produce  more  small  vehicles  to  offset  some  of  your 
large vehicles. Downsizing is a concern, and certainly compatibility 
between large and small vehicles is a concern that the agency has, 
independent  of  CAFE.  Compatibility—safety  is  something  that 
we’re working on. So, there are a little bit of numbers to it. I would 
note,  again,  that  we  have  not  seen  or  heard  that  there  are  manu-
facturers who are intending to change their product plans or make 
dramatic  changes  on  production  decisions,  based  on  what  the 
CAFE  number  might  be.  Some  years,  they  make  CAFE—some  of 
the  manufacturers—and  some  years,  they  don’t.  They  either  use 
the  credits  that  they’ve  built  up,  because  we  allow  them  to  save 
their  credits  for  3  years  if  they’re  over  the  CAFE  number,  and 
some  years  they  pay  fines.  But,  so  far  as  we  can  tell,  they’re  not 
making  production  decisions  based  on  the  particular  CAFE  num-
ber. 

Senator  SMITH.  Aren’t  there  other  ways  to  enhance  safety,  Ni-
cole, such as by standardizing bumper heights, that aren’t based on 
weight, but that can, in fact, increase safety? 

Ms.  NASON.  Yes,  Senator,  we  have  recently  had  conversations 

about making changes to bumpers, specifically. 

Senator SMITH. I see. 
Ms.  NASON.  The  bumper  standard  has  changed  since  the  1980s. 
But  one  of  the  things  that  we’re  looking  at—for  example,  is,  when 
we’re testing the vehicles, do we need to make changes in our bar-
rier, the way that we run a barrier into a vehicle—should we make 
changes  so  that  it’s  a  barrier  that  perhaps  more  closely  replicates 
a  real-world  larger  vehicle  with  a  higher  bumper?  So,  there  are 
things  that  we  are  looking  at,  and  we  agree,  there  are  improve-
ments that can be made in safety in those areas. 

Senator  SMITH.  I  recently  saw  a  report  to  that  effect,  that  there 
is  tremendous  damage  caused  from  the  smallest  kind  of  accidents 
because of—— 

Ms. NASON. Right. 
Senator  SMITH.—bumper  configuration.  So,  I  would  certainly 

draw your attention to that. 

Ms. NASON. Yes, sir. 
Senator SMITH. In my part of the world, and, I think, in most of 
rural America, farmers are gearing up substantially, and are shift-
ing crops to produce ethanol. 

Ms. NASON. Yes. 
Senator SMITH. Obviously, fuel and food are now going to be very 
much  in  competition  in  this  country.  And  yet,  it’s  also  a  fact  that 
ethanol  burns  less  efficiently  than  gasoline.  In  fact,  it  reduces  the 
mileage  that  vehicles  will  get.  Have  you  factored  that  in  to  CAFE 
and what it all will mean, in terms of fuel efficiency standards? 

Ms.  NASON.  Well,  we  agree,  Senator,  yes,  it  does  take  more  eth-
anol  than  it  does  gasoline.  I  think  the  President’s  overall  goal  is 
to help move the country toward energy security, and that is some-
thing  that  you  gain  with  an  increase  in  ethanol.  Right  now,  if  you 
are an alternative—a flex-fuel vehicle, a vehicle that could run, for 
example,  on  gasoline  or  E85,  you  do  receive  a  credit.  The  credit  is 
capped  at  1.2,  as  you  undoubtedly  know,  miles  per  gallon,  and  it

goes  down  to  .9,  per  the  Energy  Act  of  2005.  That  is  factored  in 
by the EPA when they do the testing. So, when the numbers come 
to  NHTSA  for  compliance  purposes,  whether  we’re  going  to  give 
credits  or  impose  a  fine,  we  don’t  make  any  additional  credits,  we 
don’t  add  on  for  ethanol,  because  that  would  be  double-counting. 
EPA does it the first time. 

Senator  SMITH.  But  will  you  ultimately  need  to  put  in  some  fac-

tor for ethanol, as opposed to gasoline? 

Ms.  NASON.  At  this  time,  I  believe  we—we  think  it  makes  sense 

to let EPA—— 

Senator SMITH. OK. 
Ms.  NASON.—do  accrediting  for  it.  But  we  can  discuss  further,  if 

you’re interested. 

Senator SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator PRYOR. Senator Rockefeller? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
There are several things I wanted to say, and then I’ll ask a cou-

ple of questions. 

First  of  all,  I  have  long  supported  CAFE  increases.  I  can  think 
of only one example in 23 years here where I have not, and I’m not 
particularly  proud  of  that  example.  At  the  same  time,  I  have  op-
posed,  always,  what  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  universal  percent-
age increase, or UPI. I need to explain. 

UPI  is  a  CAFE  reform  that  would  require  all  automakers  to  in-
crease  fuel  efficiency  by  a  set  percentage  from  today’s  corporate 
fuel  standards.  For  example,  Honda,  Toyota—to  some  extent,  Nis-
san—have  much  better  CAFE  numbers  than  the  Big  Three.  Am  I 
sympathetic  to  the  Big  Three?  No.  And  I’ll  explain  that  in  a  mo-
ment. 

It  is,  in  large  part,  because  they  made  the  technological  and  the 
innovation  changes,  these  three  other  companies,  to  achieve  their 
efficiencies  while  the  Big  Three  concentrated  on  horsepower,  plain 
and  simple,  with  an  occasional  model  to  hint  at  otherwise.  That’s 
what Americans like. I don’t particularly admire what people watch 
on television, but what Americans like, Americans get. And it’s ex-
actly  and  totally  true  with,  particularly,  the  Big  Three’s  attitude. 
So, it would be relatively easy, it would seem to me, to improve— 
if you’re of the Big Three, to improve 10 percent from their current 
fuel efficiency numbers, because they’re very low, they haven’t done 
that much, they haven’t been innovative. They’re massive bureauc-
racies.  I  have  hours  of  testimony  I  would  be  delighted  to  give  you 
on  that  subject.  A  10  percent  increase  would  be  very  difficult,  al-
though perhaps not impossible, for the companies that I mentioned 
before that, Nissan, Toyota, and Honda. 

Now,  very  rarely  does  Senator  Sununu  make  a  mistake,  but  he 
made  a  big  one  this  morning.  And  I  want  to  get  your  views  on  it, 
because it’s the law. The President and the various administration 
officials have said that the Congress needs to act to increase CAFE 
standards.  I  have  been  here  when  we  last  did  that—I  think,  14 
years  ago.  Actually,  that  was—sort  of,  the  price  of  gasoline—it 
went  up  4.3  cents  per  gallon,  the  great  gesture  of  efficiency.  How-

33 

ever,  when  the  President  and  the  administrative  folks,  like  your-
self,  say  that  we  require  congressional  action,  that  is  not  true. 
There  is  no  further  authorization  of  Congress  required  for  NHTSA 
and the President to get together and do this very basic important 
matter,  which  is  to:  increase  the  fuel  efficiency  of  our  automotive 
fleets  in  one  fell  swoop—without  the  entanglements  of  two 
branches and 535 Members of Congress—lessen our dependence on 
foreign  sources  of  oil,  improve  the  quality  of  the  air  we  breathe, 
and reduce the carbon that the transportation sector is emitting. 

Now,  I  put  that  down  as  writ.  Writ.  I  would  encourage  both  of 
our Government witnesses to respond today—if they so choose? No, 
I would like you to respond. But I also want you to make an addi-
tional  comment,  and  then  I  have  additional  questions,  if  I  have 
time. 

Whoever has to take the lead, be it the Congress or the Adminis-
tration,  I  sincerely  hope  we  can  agree—we  must  agree—that  we 
must  increase  automobile  fuel  efficiency.  I,  frankly,  am  a  purist 
about this. No, I don’t come from a big automobile-producing state, 
and  I  have—ever  since  I’ve  been  here,  for  23–24  years,  I’ve  been 
a purist on this subject. Purist. With one exception, which I regret. 
I believe there should be a standard much higher than we have in 
place today, which every automaker should exceed or meet, and in 
a reasonable timeframe. And I don’t think either of you have really 
risen to that excitement very much. 

So,  let  me  just,  for  a  moment,  go  back  to  the  idea  of  the  power 
of  the  President  and  NHTSA,  or  perhaps  other  agencies,  to  go 
ahead  and  do  this  on  their  own,  without  us,  which  is,  in  fact,  the 
case, and which you have carefully avoided mentioning. 

Ms. NASON. Thank you, Senator Rockefeller. Perhaps you will be 
surprised  that  I  do  agree  on  both  points.  On  UPI,  on  an  uniform 
percentage  increase,  in  our  draft  legislation,  we  proposed  prohib-
iting that, making that not a way for the agency to increase CAFE, 
because,  as  you  said,  there  are  some  manufacturers  who  have  al-
ready made the investments, and others have not. So, we wouldn’t 
want  to  ask  for—our  goal,  for  example,  is  4  percent—a  4  percent 
increase  may  be  easier  at  a  lower  end  than  it  is  at  a  higher  end, 
and that is why we agree that a UPI would be an unfair imposition 
on some manufacturers. 

Regarding  the  authority  to  increase  the  CAFE  number  for  pas-
senger cars, I believe we do have the authority to increase the pas-
senger  car.  Right  now,  the  overall  fleet  average  is  27.5.  We  could 
probably—28 or 29 or 30. What we’d like to have, and what we are 
asking for—Congress for, is for two pieces, the ability to reform the 
program,  similar  to  what  we’ve  done  to  light  trucks,  and  to  in-
crease the stringency level. And we’d like to marry those two pieces 
together and reform CAFE in a way that the National Academy of 
Sciences  has  recommended,  in  a  way  that  we  believe  is  most  re-
sponsible, but also guaranteeing an increase. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  If  you  mean  what  you  say,  the  National 
Academy  of  Sciences,  you  agree  with  me,  et  cetera,  but  you  want 
to  marry  these  two  in  legislation,  one  supporting  the  other,  either 
of  which  could  bring  the  other  down—535  people  agreeing  on  a 
CAFE  standard,  to  be  then  supported  by  the  President  of  the 
United  States,  with  a  lot  of  pressure  building  up  from  all  over  the

country,  is  not  an  easy  thing  to  do.  So,  it  seems  to  me  that  you’d 
do better to go ahead and do the first, and then come to us for the 
second, if you need to. 

One  more  point,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  think,  frankly,  it  is  an  insult 
for  those  who  would  make  this  argument  to  the  American  worker, 
to  say  that  somebody  comes  before  Congress  and—that  our  auto-
makers  cannot  make  efficient  cars.  I  find  that  an  extraordinary 
statement.  Don’t  blame  the  workers  for  that.  I  blame  the  manage-
ment for that. I’ve dealt with GM, Chrysler, and Ford management 
for  many  years.  I  have  three  Ford  cars,  if  that’ll  do  you  any  good. 
But it is astounding, it is one of the great examples of lassitude in 
our public policy in the last couple of generations. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator PRYOR. Thank you. 
Senator Boxer? 

STATEMENT OF HON. BARBARA BOXER, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA 

Senator BOXER. Thank you so much. 
Administrator Nason, I think you do a very good job of testifying 
for  this  administration,  but  I  have  to  tell  you,  for  those  who  want 
to  do  nothing  about  fuel  economy,  you  are  the  perfect  spokesman. 
And it’s amazing to me, because I’ve been listening. You’re the per-
fect  spokesman.  And,  you  know,  to  me,  I  look  at  the  world  today, 
I  look  at  the  fact  that  we’re  at  war  in  the  Middle  East,  I  look  at 
the fact that we have a situation where we are dependent on coun-
tries  we  don’t  want  to  be  dependent  upon,  and  you  are  in  a  posi-
tion,  in  this  day,  in  this  moment,  to  step  up  to  the  plate,  and  it 
is  very  sad  that,  you  know,  you  just  sit  there  and  absorb  these 
questions, and business as usual seems to be fine. 

Now,  I  want  to  ask  you,  do  you  think  fuel  economy  is  a  good 
thing  for  our  country?  Do  you  think  it’s  good  that  we  try  to  push 
forward to get better fuel economy in our country? 

Ms. NASON. If you mean improve fuel economy, yes, Senator—— 
Senator BOXER. OK. 
Ms. NASON.—Boxer, I do. 
Senator BOXER. Now, do you know what fuel economy was when 

time. 

Congress instituted the law in 1975? 

Ms.  NASON.  I  believe  the  law  doubled  the  fuel  economy  at  the 

Senator BOXER. It was 13.5 miles per gallon. And if you were sit-
ting in that seat for this administration back then, I would bet you 
would have the same type of responses. And then nothing got done 
since 1990. Nothing has gotten done. And it’s extraordinary to me. 
Now,  the  automakers—and  I  want  to  talk  about  greenhouse  gas 
emissions,  because  we  have—myself,  Senator  Lautenberg,  Senator 
Snowe—are very involved in meeting that challenge. And I want to 
ask you this. Do you know that the automakers have admitted that 
they’re  part  of  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  problem?  Are  you 
aware that they’ve admitted that? 

[No response.] 
Senator  BOXER.  I  mean,  if—I  will  place  in  the  record  for  you  to 
see  that  they  have—do  you  know  what  proportion  of  greenhouse

gas  emissions  are  traced  to  mobile  sources  in  America  today?  How 
much of the problem? 

Ms. NASON. I believe it’s 30 percent for the transportation sector. 
Senator BOXER. That is absolutely right. Why on earth would you 
have  assigned  a  zero—a  zero  benefit  for  reduction  of  carbon  diox-
ide?  I  don’t  understand  it.  Now,  your  answer  that  was  given  is, 
‘‘The scientific community has not’’—this is not you, this is your or-
ganization—‘‘The scientific community has not reached a consensus 
on  the  value  that  should  be  assigned  to  carbon  dioxide.’’  However, 
are  you  aware  that  they  did  give  you  a  range  of  options,  none  of 
which were zero? Why would you pick zero? 

Ms.  NASON.  I  believe,  at  the  time,  the  agency  did  look  at  the 
range,  and  the  range  was  very  broad;  and  so,  they  were  not  able 
to narrow it. I do think—— 

Senator BOXER. Did you ever heard of compromising between the 
low  range  and  the  high  range.  How  do  you  give  it  zero?  How  do 
you  give  it  zero?  Reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  vehicles 
has  important  long-term  implications  for  our  environment  and  our 
way of life. Have you not read the IPCC report? Have you seen the 
IPCC report? 

Ms. NASON. I have not read the report, but I—— 
Senator BOXER. OK. 
Ms.  NASON.—I  have  read  our  rulemaking.  I  do  agree  with  you. 
That’s what it says for light trucks. I think the range that we were 
looking  at  was  somewhere  between—even  if  you  drop  off  the  far- 
right and the far-left numbers—— 

Senator  BOXER.  What  do  you  mean,  ‘‘the  far-right  and  the  far- 

Ms.  NASON.  Negative  values,  which  we  disagree  with,  to  $1,600 

left’’? 

a ton—— 

Senator BOXER. But why do you say ‘‘far-right and far-left’’? 
Ms. NASON. On the range, the—— 
Senator BOXER. Oh, I thought you meant—— 
Ms. NASON.—not—— 
Senator BOXER.—politically. I was wondering—— 
Ms. NASON. No, no, no. 
Senator  BOXER.—because  this  is  a  scientific  issue,  and  I  was— 

when we say ‘‘far right and far left,’’ we talk about politics. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  BOXER.  So,  you  mean  the  range  on  the  left  side  of  the 

page and—— 

Ms. NASON. Right. Of the—— 
Senator BOXER.—the right side. 
Ms. NASON.—the ledger. 
Senator BOXER. OK. 
Ms. NASON. The right and the left. 
Senator BOXER. But—so, you have read about the IPCC—— 
Ms. NASON. Yes. 
Senator  BOXER.—report.  And  the  U.N.  Foundation  report  that 
came out right after it. And you have heard the President mention 
climate change in his speech. And yet, you assign it a zero. 

Mr.  Chairman,  this  is  really  sad.  When  you  have  a  third  of  the 
problem coming from mobile sources, and you get zero credit for re-
ducing greenhouse gas emissions.

You know, I think you need to go back and take another look at 

that.

Now, are you aware that—I’m sure you agree, because I think we 
all agree, that it’s important for America to be able to sell its prod-
ucts in other countries. I’m sure you would agree with that. 

Ms. NASON. Yes. 
Senator BOXER. Yes. Well, are you aware that China, for the first 
time,  is  going  to  impose  minimal  fuel  economy  standards?  Now, 
China  has  the  worst  environmental  record  of  any  country.  You  re-
alize  they’re  going  to  surpass  us  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions  very 
soon. 

Ms. NASON. I am aware they are discussing that in China. I don’t 

believe that they’ve passed anything yet. 

Senator BOXER. Well, let me make my point. 
Ms. NASON. Yes. 
Senator  BOXER.  The  draft—OK—that  they  have  come  up  with 
would  mean  that  some  of  our  automakers,  including  the  auto— 
Chevrolet  Blazer—would  not  measure  up  to  the  standards.  Now, 
doesn’t—as  you  sit  there,  does  it  give  you  any  pause  that  China, 
you  know,  the  worst  leader  on  the  environment,  the  worst  leader 
on greenhouse gas emissions, is—may well, because of their legisla-
tive actions, say to American car companies, ‘‘Gee, if you don’t mod-
ify,  you’re  not  going  to  be  able  to  sell  here?’’  Does  that  give  you 
pause? Does that not make you realize that sometimes when we do 
things  around  here,  it  actually  helps  our  business?  Are  you  aware 
that  when  seatbelt  laws  went  in,  the  automobile  companies  said, 
‘‘Oh, don’t do this to us.’’ And then, they had the airbags, ‘‘Oh, don’t 
do  this  to  us.’’  And  now,  they  take  credit  for  it.  They  take  credit 
for  it.  And  now,  you  see  ads  where  the  companies  are  saying, 
‘‘We’re  doing  better  on  fuel  economy.’’  Why?  Because  we  took  ac-
tion. 

So,  the  point  I’m  trying  to  make  is—when  you  were  confirmed, 
I  asked  you  a  question  in  that  confirmation  hearing,  and  I  said, 
‘‘How  do  you  feel  about  fuel  economy  standards?’’  And  you  an-
swered  you’re  going  to  work  with  us  on  this.  Have  you  met  with 
Senators here on this issue to discuss ways of making fuel economy 
better in America since you are going to celebrate your 1-year anni-
versary  in  your  post  pretty  soon  in  a  couple  of  months?  Have  you 
met with anyone? 

Ms.  NASON.  Yes,  Senator,  we  met  with  some  Members  and  staff 

last year and again this year. 

Senator  BOXER.  Do  you  support  the  legislation,  say,  of  my  col-

leagues, Senator Snowe and Senator Feinstein? 
Ms. NASON. I think we have the same goals. 
Senator BOXER. Do you support their legislation? 
Ms. NASON. Of course we support the administration’s—— 
Senator BOXER. Do you—— 
Ms. NASON.—proposal to—— 
Senator BOXER. Do you oppose their legislation? 
Ms. NASON. No, I don’t think—— 
Senator BOXER. Does NHTSA oppose the legislation? 
Ms. NASON. No, I don’t think I’d say we—— 
Senator BOXER. So—— 
Ms. NASON.—oppose it. I think——

37 

Senator  BOXER.  So,  therefore,  we  can  say,  at  this  hearing,  be-
cause it’s news, that NHTSA does not oppose Senator Snowe’s leg-
islation. Can we tell the people that at home? 

Ms.  NASON.  I  think  ‘‘does  not  oppose’’  and  ‘‘would  like  to  work 

with the Senators to’’—— 

Senator BOXER. OK. 
Ms. NASON.—‘‘make some changes’’ is not the same as—— 
Senator  BOXER.  And  what  would  those  changes—what  would 

those changes be—look like? 

Ms.  NASON.  Well,  the  challenging  issue  for  us  in  many  of  the 
pieces  of  legislation  that  we’ve  seen,  not  just  that  particular  bill, 
but others in the House and others in the Senate—— 

Senator BOXER. Well, I’m talking about this particular bill. 
Ms.  NASON.  They  have  the  same—the  same  theme  seems  to  be 
coming through, which is that Congress would like to have a guar-
antee  in  statute  of  an  increase,  and  Congress  would  like  to  make 
sure  that  there’s  a  guarantee  that  there’s  no  backsliding,  if  you 
will.  So,  there  needs  to  be  a  guaranteed  floor  and  a  guaranteed 
ceiling. And the challenge that we have in doing a reform proposal 
is being hemmed in by specifics. 

Senator BOXER. OK. 
Ms.  NASON.  You  must  be  a  top  and  you  must  be  a  certain  num-

ber at the bottom. 

Senator  BOXER.  OK.  All  right.  Well,  that  says  it  all.  Fuel  econ-

omy standards are specific, and they are numbers. 

Thank you. 
Senator  PRYOR.  Before  I  recognize  Senator  Lautenberg,  I’d  just 
like to tell the Committee and the witnesses that it looks like we’re 
going  to  have  a  vote,  around  noon,  which  is  in  about  10  minutes 
or so, and we’re on a trajectory with two or three Senators remain-
ing  to  wrap  up  this  panel  at  about,  maybe,  5  or  10  after.  So,  we’ll 
do that. What I’d like to do is just take a very brief 5- to 10-minute 
recess,  and  then  have  the  second  panel  come  back  immediately 
after that vote. 

Senator Lautenberg? 

STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Thanks  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  And 

I’m sorry that I was called to another committee. 

But this hearing, in my view, borders on the critical, because this 
is  the  one  place  that  others  have  shown  us  that  we  can  deal  with. 
And it’s pitiful, when you look at how we are smothered with infor-
mation  about  global  warming  and  the  threats  that  it  poses  to  my 
ten  grandchildren,  to  everybody’s  grandchildren,  to  future  genera-
tions,  and  we,  kind  of,  sit  back,  and  things  don’t  happen.  So,  it 
pains  me  when  I  see  what  has  happened.  I  don’t  think  I  can  be 
here  for  the  next  panel,  Mr.  Chairman,  but  the  next  panel  is  a 
place  that  I’d  like  to  discuss  why  America  dropped  the  ball—when 
we  had  the  goal  posts,  the  stadium,  the  whole  thing,  and  we 
dropped the ball. It’s pitiful. 

All  of  us  want  America  to  lead,  and,  when  it  comes  to  reducing 
emissions  that  create  global  warming,  we’re  behind.  And  we’ve  got 
a chart here that my able chart-holder——

Senator  LAUTENBERG.—and  we  see  what  has  happened.  These 
were  projected  goals.  And  we  see  that  America  is  at  the  bottom. 
And  if  we  look  at  the  year  2006,  where  the  projections  have  actu-
ally  kind  of  been  met,  and  China—China  is  doing  better  than  we 
are. And the EU—you know, they’re almost double our accomplish-
ments  to  date,  when  you  look  at—here  we  are,  we’re  hovering 
around the 22–24 miles to the gallon, and the others are now—Ja-
pan’s  over  40,  and  people  are  buying  Japanese  cars,  and  in  pretty 
good  quantity.  Unfortunately—and  the  negative  effect  is  on  our 
jobs  and  is  on  our  industry  leadership  and  our  growing  import 
base.  So,  based  on  this,  Japan,  obviously,  is  currently  leading  the 
world.  Many  Japanese  drivers  are  getting  more  than  40  miles  per 
gallon.  And  when  you  look  at  us,  we  are,  as  I  said  earlier,  behind. 
Our passenger cars have been getting 27.5 miles to the gallon since 
1990.  And  light  trucks  have  been  getting  21.6  miles  per  gallon. 
One-third of America’s greenhouse gases, as you acknowledged, Ms. 
Nason, come from the tailpipes of cars and trucks. And to cut those 
emissions  and  fight  global  warming,  we’ve  got  to  increase  our 
CAFE standards, and make those standards mandatory. 

This  year,  the  Bush  Administration  adopted  new  CAFE  stand-
ards  for  light  trucks.  Their  standards  are  too  weak.  They’re  not 
going to cut emissions or global warming. We need stronger stand-
ards to cut emissions and save the environment. And I don’t know 
where we’re going to step up to the plate and do it. I’m an original 
cosponsor of legislation to improve fuel economy by 10 miles a gal-
lon over 10 years, and I’m going to work with my colleagues on the 
Commerce  Committee  to  promote  mandatory  laws  that  reduce 
greenhouse gases in our atmosphere.

And  I  would  ask  you,  Ms.  Nason—the  President’s  plan  for  a 
CAFE  reform  allows  the  Department  of  Transportation  to  revise 
CAFE standards up or down based on market conditions. What are 
the conditions that could lead NHTSA to reduce CAFE standards— 
to reduce them? 

Ms. NASON. I can commit to you, Senator Lautenberg, that if we 
have  the  authority  to  reform  the  program,  we  will  increase  the 
standards. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. We want to increase them. 
Ms. NASON. Yes, sir. 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  So,  then,  again,  we  are  effectively  having 
reductions  by  not  meeting  the  more  imposing  conditions  that  we 
have upon us. I think Senator Boxer was quite clear in her expres-
sions  about  where  we  are  and  why  we’re,  kind  of,  sitting  on  our 
hands.  We’ve  got  Americans  traveling  33  million  trips  on  public 
transportation each day, which significantly reduces the amount of 
people that get in their cars and drive——reducing congestion, pol-
lution,  et  cetera.  Now,  what  are  the  specific  measures  that  the 
President’s  gasoline  reduction  proposal  contained,  that  will  in-
crease the use of public transit? Do you see any? 

Ms. NASON. The President’s proposal to reduce gasoline consump-

Senator LAUTENBERG. Yes, that will—— 
Ms. NASON.—is 8.4 billion gallons. 
Senator LAUTENBERG.—that will take advantage of this one thing 
that we know about, that is to increase the use of public transpor-
tation. 

Ms.  NASON.  Well,  there’s  nothing  in  the  proposal  that  would  de-

crease—— 

tion—— 

Senator LAUTENBERG. No, no—— 
Ms. NASON.—the use of public transportation. It’s a—— 
Senator LAUTENBERG. I know. So, we just stand still, then. 
Ms. NASON. It’s a proposal directed toward cars and light trucks 

for an increase—— 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Well, but—— 
Ms. NASON.—in CAFE. It could be that if CAFE—— 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Well, one of the ways that we can do that, 

we know, is to get people out of their cars—— 

Ms. NASON. Right. 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.—and  get  to  more  efficient  use  of  public 
transportation.  And  so,  we’re  looking  at  a—an  opportunity  here— 
for instance, I’m a strong advocate of improving Amtrak’s ability to 
carry people, as you know, and the President offers us budgets that 
will put Amtrak into bankruptcy. And so, it seems to me that with 
that  easy  transition  from  the  roadway  to  the  better  way—is  some-
thing  that  we  ought  to  be  doing.  And  I  have  one  last  chart  that 
shows  you  the  BTU  per  passenger  mile.  Amtrak  is—has  the  num-
ber  2,935;  cars,  way  up  ahead  of  that;  airlines,  even  more.  So, 
there’s an opportunity to do something here. And I would urge you 
to  talk  to  the  people  you  know  in  the  administration,  rather,  and 
urge  them  to  find  the  easy  way  out,  just  step  up  and  support  Am-
trak all the way.

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thanks very much. 
[Laughter.] 
Ms. NASON. Thank you, Senator Lautenberg. 
Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Senator Lautenberg. 
Senator Snowe, as always, you’ve been patient. 

STATEMENT OF HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE 

Senator SNOWE. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Well, first of all, Administrator Nason, I share many of the state-
ments  that  Senator  Boxer  raised.  It  is  confounding  to  me  that 
NHTSA  would  place  a  zero-value  benefit  to  the  reductions  of  car-
bon  dioxide  emissions  that  I  think  is  a  fundamental  benefit  of  the 
CAFE  standards.  Why  would  you  place  a  zero-value  benefit  to 
those reductions? I mean, since the United States represents 4 per-
cent, 5 percent of the world’s population, yet we contribute 25 per-
cent  of  the  world’s  carbon  dioxide  emissions—I  mean,  it’s  dem-
onstrated,  time  and  time  again,  that  CAFE  standards  will  reduce 
those emissions. Why would you provide a zero-value benefit? 

Ms. NASON. Thank you, Senator. 
We  agree  that  it’s  a  benefit,  and  we  were  able  to  quantify  it  for 
the  light  truck  rule,  73  million  metric  tons.  The  difficulty  we  had 
was  in  monetizing  the  value  of  the  benefit.  So,  we  can  quantify  it, 
but  we  had  a  challenge—the  agency  had  a  challenge  in  trying  to 
monetize  that,  because  there  was  no  consensus,  when  they  did  a 
review  of  the  scientific  literature,  of  what  the  appropriate  value 
would  be,  as  compared  to,  say,  carbon  monoxide  or  nitrogen  oxide 
or particulate matter or VOC—there were—there was consensus in 
the  industry—in  the  community  on  that.  There  was  not  consensus 
on CO2.

Senator  SNOWE.  Well,  I  think—Ms.  Siggerud,  do  you  have  any 
comments  on  that?  Is  that  possible  to  do  for—and  make  a  rec-
ommendation to this committee? 

Ms.  SIGGERUD.  Administrator  Nason  is  right  that  there  is  some 
uncertainty  on  this  issue;  however,  in  running  a  cost-benefit  anal-
ysis that lays the foundation for the standards that have been pro-
posed  for  light  trucks,  or  that  could  be  used  to  increase  the  car 
standard,  there  are  ways  of  dealing  with  uncertainty  in  a  model, 
developing a range, perhaps, and then using that information to set 
a standard. 

Senator SNOWE. Well, Mr. Chairman, I’d recommend that we re-
quire  NHTSA  to  come  back,  you  know,  with  a  model  that  includes 
a  benefit  regarding  carbon  dioxide  emissions.  I  think  there’s  no 
other  way.  I  sense  a  great  deal  of  foot-dragging,  reluctance,  and, 
frankly,  you  know,  just  bureaucratic  obstacles  to  this  whole  proc-
ess.  I  mean,  it  doesn’t  really  exemplify—and  I  think  you’ll  sense 
the  frustration  here  today—the—America’s  ‘‘can  do’’  spirit,  you 
know, that should be resonating at this point in time, where we’re, 
you  know,  facing  radical  regimes,  and  we’re—dependency  on  for-
eign  oil,  the  whole  issue  concerning  the  crisis  in  climate  change. 
We should be rising to the occasion. And that’s just simply not hap-
pening. And that’s why, you know, you see the concerns here, dem-
onstrated, you know, in multiple ways, through legislation, through 
speeches,  and  so  on,  because  we  don’t  see  amything  but  otherwise 
bureaucratic  resistance  and—you  know,  and  obstruction,  frankly, 
to this process. 

What I keep hearing is what we can’t do. We have to reform the 
CAFE  standards.  Well,  that  doesn’t  have  to  be  mutually  exclusive 
by  increasing  the  CAFE  standards.  I  mean,  the  National  Academy 
of  Sciences  report,  you  know,  spoke  to  the  enormous  and  measur-
able  benefits  that  CAFE  standards—increasing  CAFE  standards 
have  brought  to  this  country.  I  mean,  we  increased  it  by  40  to  50 
percent when we did it between the 1970s and through 1990. What 
is  preventing  America  today,  in  the  21st  century,  with  the  techno-
logical  advancements  in—it’s  just—it’s  astonishing  to  me  what  I’m 
hearing.  Where  we’re  facing  a  confluence,  you  know,  of,  you  know, 
national  security  challenges,  and  it’s  central  to  our  dependency  on 
foreign  oil,  not  to  mention  the  environmental  implications,  and 
we’re  saying,  ‘‘Well,  we’ve  got  all  of  these  multiple  bureaucratic 
steps  to  be  taken,  and  we  can’t  do  it.’’  Well,  of  course  we  can  do 
it. 

And  I  just  think  that—Mr.  Chairman,  that  we  ought  to  be  con-
sidering  a  requirement  for  NHTSA  to  come  back  with  a  model 
and—because it’s obviously not going to happen, and, if it does hap-
pen, it’s going to be such a long period of time. 

I mean, I’m just thinking—how long is it going to take to reform 
the CAFE program, Ms. Nason? What’s your estimate of time? How 
long would it take to reform? What are you giving for time on that? 
Ms.  NASON.  Our  goal  would  be  to  begin  in—seeing  an  increase 
in model year 2010. By statute, the manufacturers have 18 months 
to  make  changes  to  their  product  plans  to  meet  CAFE,  so  we’d 
have  to  have  a  final  rule  out  by  next  April  1,  essentially,  to  guar-
antee an increase in model year 2010.

Senator  SNOWE.  Well,  you  know,  frankly,  that’s  why,  you  know, 
Senator  Feinstein  introduced  the  legislation.  I  think  that  all—you 
know,  there  are  many  of  the  Committee  members  who  have  sup-
ported  it.  Senator  Boxer’s  been  a  leader  on  this  question.  I  think, 
frankly, the time has come for Congress—I mean, I don’t think we 
can  afford,  you  know,  to  rely  on  bureaucratic  passivity,  frankly. 
And I think that’s what we’ve got here. I mean, I really do. I don’t 
see  any  sense  of  urgency.  It’s  not  what—you  know,  like  President 
Kennedy  did  when  he  was,  you  know,  in—you  know,  calling  upon 
America and its entrepreneurial spirit to place a man on the Moon, 
and  we  did  it  within  10  years,  and—actually,  less  than  10  years. 
I don’t—I just cannot understand why we can’t be, at this moment 
in time—and I just don’t see it. I think we ought to be able to meet 
‘‘Ten-in-Ten’’  without  any  question.  We  have  that  capacity.  And  I 
just—it  just  sounds  like,  to  me,  where  we’ve  got  more,  you  know, 
impediments,  you  know,  the—and  I  think  it’s  just  not  willing  to 
do—it’s  a  lot  of  foot-dragging,  frankly.  That’s  what  I  sense  here. 
And,  frankly,  it’s  minuscule  on  the  light  truck  side.  I  mean,  seri-
ously. And that’s all America can do? I mean, China’s beating us— 
as  Senator  Boxer  said.  I  mean,  you  know,  elevating  their  CAFE 
standards?  I  don’t  know  how  we  can  be  competitive  in,  you  know, 
this  global  economy  of  the  21st  century,  if  this  is  the  kind  of  atti-
tude  we  continue  to  exhibit,  time  and  again,  when  we’re  facing 
some serious, you know, challenges. And, frankly, the CAFE stand-
ards is the least of which we can do. We’re not saying it’s mutually 
exclusive  to  all  other  propositions.  But  clearly  it  is  a  central  force. 
And  the  reason  why  we’re—we—if  we  could  improve  it,  you  know, 
by 50 percent—we increase the fuel efficiency standards, the—and, 
you  know,  it’s  between—from  18  miles  per  gallon  to  27.5  between 
1978  and  1990,  then  can  you  imagine,  if  we’d  been  on  this  course, 
we  would  be  at  40  miles  per  gallon.  So,  it’s  just  not  exhibiting  the 
necessary  approach  and  attitude  and  spirit  that  I  think  that  these 
times require. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Snowe follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE 
I want to thank the Chairman for holding this hearing, and look forward to work-
ing  with  my  colleagues  to  ensure  that  this  Committee  asserts  itself  as  an  integral 
part  of  the  holistic  revision  of  our  Nation’s  energy  policy.  Certainly  as  a  longtime 
proponent  of  increasing  CAFE  standards,  I  believe  increasing  the  fuel  economy  of 
America’s automobiles, SUVs, and trucks is indispensable in attaining that goal. 

In  a  recent  meeting  of  energy  stakeholders,  Thomas  Friedman,  the  noted  New 
York  Times  columnist,  was  approached  by  an  industry  representative.  This  indi-
vidual stated that, although he appreciated the columnist’s push towards alternative 
fuels and greater energy efficiency, he needed to recognize that petroleum was going 
to remain a significant part of our Nation’s fuel supply. In other words, he said that 
we  should  be  ‘‘realistic.’’  Mr.  Friedman  responded  by  saying  it  was  fortuitous  that 
this  industry  representative  was  not  a  stakeholder  when  President  Kennedy  ad-
dressed a Joint Session of Congress on May 25, 1961, where the President famously 
said,  ‘‘I  believe  that  this  Nation  should  commit  itself  to  achieving  the  goal,  before 
this  decade  is  out,  of  landing  a  man  on  the  Moon  and  returning  him  safely  to  the 
Earth.’’ 

Although  many  at  NASA  and  within  the  space  industry  found  the  challenge 
daunting,  they  were  inspired  by  this  initiative  and  fulfilled  the  President’s  dream 
with  roughly  5  months  to  spare.  I  begin  with  this  anecdote  because  I  believe  we 
should approach America’s failed energy policy with a challenge that echos the mag-
nitude of President Kennedy’s.

According  to  BusinessWeek,  U.S.  vehicles  are  currently  the  greatest  consumers  of 
petroleum  in  the  world,  accounting  for  9  million  barrels  of  gasoline  a  day.  Further-
more,  the  transportation  sector  is  projected  to  become  an  even  larger  percentage  of 
our overall energy demands. Specifically, the Energy Information Agency in its 2007 
Annual  Energy  Outlook  projected  that,  between  2005  and  2030,  93  percent  of  the 
growth in the demand for liquid fuels will occur in the transportation sector, citing, 
‘‘Growing  population,  incomes,  and  economic  output  spur  travel  demand.’’  EIA  fur-
ther  notes  that  projected  fuel  efficiency  will  only  improve  ‘‘slightly’’  if  we  maintain 
our  present  course.  The  bottom  line  is  that  the  transportation  sector  is  the  single 
largest contributor to our failing energy policy. 

It is particularly regrettable that Congress has not addressed CAFE standards be-
cause  the  effectiveness  of  such  a  policy  should  not  be  in  question.  Economics  Pro-
fessor  Austan  Goolsbee,  of  the  University  of  Chicago  Graduate  School  of  Business, 
illustrated the rewards of CAFE standards in an opinion-editorial in The New York 
Times  in  January.  In  the  article,  Professor  Goosbee  illustrated  that  from  1980  the 
efficiency  increases  in  the  transportation  sector  were  consistent  with  other  sectors. 
However, from 1990 to the present day while other sectors have modestly improved 
their  energy  efficiency  the  transportation  sector’s  energy  efficiency  has  been  stag-
nant.  Professor  Gossbee  concluded  that,  ‘‘Our  regulations  are  now  much  less  strin-
gent  than  those  in  Europe,  Japan  and  even  China  . . .  Since  1990,  the  number  of 
gallons we use, even on a per vehicle basis, rose substantially.’’ 

The  fact  is  that,  since  1990,  Congress  has  neglected  its  responsibility  to  increase 
fuel efficiency standards, and I do not believe that Congress should continue to abro-
gate this responsibility. Since 2001, Senator Feinstein and I have introduced legisla-
tion  that  would  have  significantly  increased  CAFE  standards  by  closing  the  SUV 
loophole.  In  this  Congress,  Senator  Feinstein  and  I  have  introduced  even  broader 
legislation that would raise average fuel economy standards for all vehicles, includ-
ing SUVs and sedans, from 25 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon average across 
a  manufacturer’s  fleet  by  model  year  2019.  Like  Kennedy’s  call  in  1961,  I  believe 
our  initiative  rises  to  the  energy  policy  challenge  facing  the  United  States.  A  com-
pelling comparison is that my legislation would save 2.5 million barrels of oil a day 
by  2025,  which  just  happens  to  be  nearly  the  same  amount  of  oil  that  we  import 
daily from the Persian Gulf. 

From  1978  to  1990,  automobile  fuel  efficiency  increased  from  18  miles  per  gallon 
to 27.5 miles per gallon—an increase of more than 50 percent. If the United States 
had  been  consistent  and  continued  this  course  our  automobile  fuel  efficiency  would 
be more than 40 miles per gallon. I believe it is imperative that this Congress resus-
citate  a  policy  that  The  New  York  Times  called  the  ‘‘most  successful  energy-saving 
measure this country has ever seen’’ and pass increased CAFE standards. 

I  was  dismayed  to  read  in  the  GAO  testimony  that  some  experts  were  critical  of 
the  fact  that  NHTSA  assigned  a  ‘‘zero  dollar’’  value  to  the  benefit  of  reductions  in 
greenhouse  gas  emissions  that  would  result  from  an  increased  CAFE  standard. 
NHTSA  officials  stated  they  did  this  because  the  scientific  community  had  not  yet 
reached  a  consensus  on  the  value  that  should  be  assigned  to  carbon  dioxide.  One 
expert told GAO that the results of the NHTSA model may underestimate the total 
dollar  benefits  to  society  if  CAFE  standards  were  raised  since  the  dollar  value  of 
reduced greenhouse gas emissions was not included in the model’s results. 

Researchers have indeed developed a clear value that should be considered in giv-
ing  a  dollar  value  to  greenhouse  gas  reductions  and  I  believe  it  is  very  important 
that  a  benefit  value  other  than  zero  be  given  to  reducing  carbon  dioxide  emissions 
through  increasing  CAFE  standards.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  Feinstein-Snowe- 
Inouye Ten-in-Ten bill will eliminate 420 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emis-
sions by 2025, the equivalent of taking 90 million cars (or 75 million cars and light 
trucks) off the road in 1 year. There is more than a ‘‘zero dollar’’ value to the benefit 
to society for these reductions. 

My  concern  is  that,  if  NHTSA  is  given  the  jurisdiction  by  the  Congress  to  revise 
the  CAFE  program  that  it  will  not  put  a  value  on  a  decrease  in  greenhouse  gas 
emissions through improved fuel economy. It seems no one at NHTSA has read the 
February  report  from  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  on  the  dan-
gers  this  planet  is  facing  now  and  in  the  future  from  global  warming.  The  IPCC 
said  that  there  is  at  least  a  ninety  percent  certainty  that  humans  are  causing  it. 
In  light  of  the  IPCC  report,  I  find  it  unconscionable  that  NHTSA  could  draw  up 
reforms  for  improving  CAFE  standards  and  present  them  to  the  Congress  while 
using  models  where  the  benefits  of  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  through 
greater  fuel  economy  are  given  no  dollar  value.  Until  I  see  proof  that  NHTSA  will 
change  its  model  and  put  an  appropriate  dollar  value  on  reducing  CO2 emissions 
through greater fuel economy standards, I will not abrogate my responsibility to leg-
islate that these benefits to society be used in NHTSA’s models.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  suggest  that  this  committee  require  that  NHTSA 
come back to Congress with a revised assigned dollar value on the benefits of green-
house gas reductions from increases in CAFE standards before this committee votes 
to  hand  over  jurisdiction  for  the  CAFE  standards  program  for  passenger  cars  to 
NHTSA.  We  are  now  in  the  21st  century  and  our  climate  is  reaching  crisis  propor-
tions because of the increases of manmade greenhouse gas emissions and this fact— 
and the facts of the IPCC—should not be dismissed out of hand by the Department 
of Transportation. Light vehicles use 60 percent of the polluting oil in the transpor-
tation sector in this country and NHTSA has placed a zero dollar value on the bene-
fits to society if emissions were decreased through greater fuel economy. This is be-
yond my comprehension. 

When  Congress  passed  an  automobile  efficiency  title  to  the  Motor  Vehicle  Infor-
mation  and  Cost  Savings  Act  in  the  1973  Energy  bill,  the  overall  objective  was  to 
nearly  double  the  fuel  economy  of  new  passenger  vehicles  sold  in  the  United 
States—from  14  to  27.5  miles  per  gallon  (mpg)—by  model  year  (MY)  1985.  And, 
guess  what,  the  goal  was  met.  Now,  in  2007,  the  standard  is  still  set  at  27.5  miles 
per  gallon  because  Congress  has  not  demanded  a  higher  goal—even  in  light  of  tre-
mendous advances made in advanced technologies and vehicle construction. 

The Administration is asking for substantial new authority without guaranteeing 
any  increase  in  fuel  economy  that  we  need  to  save  oil  and  reduce  global  warming 
pollution, and which we know to be technologically feasible. We have the technology 
to  improve  fuel  economy  by  4  percent  per  year  (34  mpg  by  2017).  According  to  the 
Union  of  Concerned  Scientists,  the  U.S.  industry  could  make  a  41  mpg  family  car, 
a 37 mpg minivan, 34 mpg mid-size SUV, and a 30 mpg pickup. But this won’t hap-
pen without direction from Congress given this administration’s anemic track record 
on fuel economy. 

I thank the Chair. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF HON. THOMAS R. CARPER, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM DELAWARE 

Senator CARPER. Thanks, Mr. Pryor—Mr. Chairman. 
Senator  Pryor  was  in  Delaware—was  it  yesterday—was  in  Wil-
mington.  When  he  was  in  Wilmington,  he  was  about  5  miles  away 
from an auto plant where we build all the Pontiac Solstices, all the 
Saturn  Skyes  in  the  world.  And  he  was  about  20  miles  from  a 
DaimlerChrysler  plant  in  Newark,  where  we  build  all  the  Dodge 
Durangos and all the Chrysler Aspens in the world. 

Just  a  couple  of  comments.  Because  we  have  two  plants  in  my 
state,  I  like  to  go  up  to  the  Detroit  Auto  Show—if  not  every  year, 
then  every  other  year—just  to  see  what’s  being  built  there,  what’s 
being conceptualized. And 2 years ago, at the 2006 Auto Show, the 
neatest  thing  I  saw  was—actually  two  things—I  was—the  folks 
from  Honda  had  a  real  cool  idea  with  respect  to  hydrogen  and 
being  able  to  generate  electricity  from  your  onboard  vehicle,  and 
put it in the garage, sell electricity back on the grid, you know, use 
the  electricity  that  was  being  created  in  the  garage  to,  you  know, 
charge  your—get  your  car  ready  to  go  out  and  to  be  able  to,  you 
know,  light  your  house,  cool  your  house,  warm  your  house,  sell 
electricity back. It was really a cool idea. The other neat idea I saw 
a  year  ago  was  DaimlerChrysler’s  idea  called  BlueTEC,  B-l-u-e-T- 
E-C.  And  BlueTEC  is  low-emission,  50-state  diesel,  EPA-approved 
diesel,  and  that  gets  real  good  gas  mileage.  And  it’s  going  to  be, 
probably,  on  our  roads  next  year.  This  year,  at  the  Auto  Show,  I 
thought the neatest vehicle I saw was a Chevrolet product—it was 
a  GM  product,  called  a  Chevrolet  Volt.  And  the  Chevrolet  Volt  is 
a  great-looking  vehicle.  I  call  it  ‘‘eye  candy,’’  visually  very  appeal-
ing.  And  it’s  kind  of  a  sports  car.  And  the  neat  thing  about  it  is

that  it’s  a  flex-fuel  plug-in  hybrid.  And  the  battery  can  be  re-
charged  by  putting  your  foot  on  the  brake.  But  the  batteries  also 
could  be  recharged  on  it  with  an  auxiliary  power  unit  onboard— 
could be fuel cells, it could be internal combustion. And then, with 
flex  fuel,  it  could  be  diesel,  with  flex-fuel  biofuels.  And  the  battery 
always  moves  the  wheels.  The  auxiliary  power  units  always  re-
charge the battery. It’s really an elegant solution, I thought, a flex- 
fuel plug-in hybrid. 

At  the  Auto  Show,  I  talked  to  the  folks  from  GM.  And  I  talked 
to folks from all the major auto companies that were there, at least 
the U.S.-based, and some of the foreign folks. And I said, ‘‘I’m real-
ly  enamored  with  the  flex-fuel  plug-in  hybrid  concept  that  you’ve 
shown  us  here,’’  and  I  said,  ‘‘What’s  keeping  us  from  making  it?’’ 
And they said, ‘‘The thing that is keeping us from making it is that 
we  don’t  have  the  battery.’’  And  then  they  said,  ‘‘Apparently,  the 
Japanese are over there working on battery technology. They’re not 
anxious  to  share  it  with  us,  because  that  would  give  us  a  leg  up, 
and they want to have a leg-up, as you might imagine.’’ I called on 
the  President  and  also  the—Rob  Portman,  OMB  Director.  I  called 
on  Secretary  Bodman  at  the  Energy  Department,  to  put  some  real 
money in the budget for battery technology. And, lo and behold, he 
put  $81  million  in  the  Administration’s  budget,  on  battery  tech-
nology.  And  y’all  have  been  getting  beaten  on  here  pretty  good 
today, which is probably not altogether bad. We’ve all been in—sit-
ting  in  the  seats  that  you’ve  taken—and  I  must  say  that  the  ad-
ministration’s leadership on these issues has been disappointing, at 
best. But I must say, I was encouraged that there’s real money for 
this battery technology and that we have the ability to move a little 
closer  to  having  the  ability  to  provide  more  energy-efficient  vehi-
cles. The bad thing is it just takes so long. 

And the last thing I want to say, Senator Lautenberg showed us 
some  nice-looking  charts  up  here,  and  multicolored,  and  they’re 
looking  at  comparing  BTU  consumption  for  trains  and  planes  and 
cars. It was just a good ‘‘gee-whiz’’ for y’all to take home with you. 
If you move a ton of freight by rail from Washington, D.C., to Bos-
ton, Massachusetts—a ton of freight by rail from Washington, D.C., 
to  Boston,  Massachusetts—it  takes  about  1  gallon  of  diesel  fuel. 
Pretty  good,  isn’t  it?  Move  it—1  ton  of  freight  from  Washington, 
D.C., to Boston, Massachusetts, by rail, takes about 1 gallon of die-
sel  fuel.  And  I  know  the  administration  is  not  a  big  believer  in 
trains,  whether  moving  people  or  freight,  for  that  matter,  but  I 
think that’s part of the solution. 

Let  me  ask  you,  if  I  can  in  the  2  minutes  that  are  left  for  me, 
if  you  were  in  my  shoes,  if  you  were  in  Senator  Pryor’s  shoes,  and 
you  were  looking  at  this  issue,  what  would  you  do  differently? 
What  would  you  do—not  the  administration’s  proposal—but  what 
would  you  do  differently?  Not  to  say  it’s  totally  without  value,  but 
what would you do if you were in our shoes? 

Ms. NASON. If—I agree with you, Senator. One of the huge chal-
lenges for all of the industry is battery technology. I mean, if you’re 
looking  to  make  improvements  in  CAFE,  CAFE  is  not  a  program 
that  you’re  going  to  see  a  turnaround  at  the  price  of  the  pump  to-
morrow.  There  was  a  lot  of  conversation  last  year  about  that. 
CAFE  is  a  long-term  gradual  increase.  But,  still,  the  only  way,

overall,  to  have  a  higher  fuel  efficiency  for  the  fleet,  40-mile-per- 
gallon type, is to move into new technologies, is to move away from 
a  straight  internal  combustion  engine  and  to  move  more  toward, 
first,  clean  diesels,  but  also  into  hybrids  and  then  into  hydrogen 
fuel  cells,  into  vehicles  like  the  Volt,  which  I  also  saw  at  the  De-
troit Auto Show. And I think we do need to, and the administration 
has, as you said, put more money into battery research technology. 
That  is  the  way  of  the  future.  If  you’re  moving  away  from  nickel- 
metal-hydride and into lithium-ion, you need to resolve some of the 
problems with lithium-ion, like catching fire, for example, is a safe-
ty issue that we need to address. You need to make them durable. 
You need to bring the cost down. So, that is something that I think 
we need to look at more closely, and be more supportive of, for the 
overall auto industry. 

Senator CARPER. Thank you. 
Ms. Siggerud? 
Ms.  SIGGERUD.  Senator  Carper,  setting  aside  the  Volt  car,  there 
are a number of other technologies that look to be available in the 
nearer future than that, that certainly make it possible to increase 
the  car  standard  over  time.  It  has  been  static  for  largely  two  dec-
ades,  although  the  work  that  we’ve  done  showed  it  is  possible  and 
should  be  done.  The  question  that  the  Congress  needs  to  address 
at  this  point  is  whether  to  move  ahead,  have  the  administration 
simply set a higher standard over time, using the current program, 
or  to  make  some  revisions  to  it  to  address  some  of  the  equity  and 
safety  issues  that  are  associated  with  increasing  that  standard. 
And  that  is  really  a  decision  for  the  Committee  to  make,  whether 
to direct the administration to simply move ahead in a straight-line 
approach  or  to  make  some  changes  to  the  program.  If  the  latter 
choice  is  the  one  you  would  choose,  then  the  Congress  does  need 
to act to provide some different authority. 

Senator  CARPER.  My  time’s  expired.  Let  me  just  say,  I  think 
there  are  three  things  that  we  can  do  as  a  country—administra-
tion,  Congress,  and  private  sector  together—but,  for  the  Federal 
Government, number one, use Federal monies to help fund R&D— 
basic R&D, whether it’s fuel cells, whether it’s battery technology— 
Federal funds going into new technology to enhance the energy per-
formance  of  our  vehicles.  Number  two,  use  the  Government’s  pur-
chasing  power  to  help  commercialize  these  technologies  when  they 
are produced—on the defense side and the civilian side—to use our 
purchasing  power  to  help  commercialization.  Number  three  is, 
where  it’s  appropriate,  to  provide  tax  credits  to  incentivize  people 
to buy, whether it’s a highly energy-efficient hybrid or a highly en-
ergy-efficient  low-emission  diesel,  to  use  it—those  are  three  things 
that I think we can do. And, to some extent, we’re doing them; we 
just need to do more of them. Thank you. 

Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator PRYOR. Senator Carper, thank you. 
And we’ve had a little change in plans. And that is, I’m going to 
recess the Committee probably for about 5 minutes. Senator Kerry 
is  voting  right  now  and  is  going  to  come  right  back,  and  he’ll  re-
start,  because  he  wants  to  ask  this  panel  some  questions.  And 
then,  as  soon  as  Senator  Kerry  finishes,  I  anticipate,  unless  other 
Senators  show  up  that  want  to  ask  this  panel  questions,  we’ll  go

to the second panel. So, what we’ll do is, we’ll stand in recess here 
for approximately 5 minutes, until Senator Kerry comes back. 

[Recess.] 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN F. KERRY, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS 

Senator KERRY [presiding]. Well, we’ll come back to order. Thank 
you  all  for  already,  I  guess,  being  there.  An  orderly  group.  And 
thanks  for  staying  over.  I  apologize—with  the  vote—but  I  wanted 
to have an opportunity to be able to ask a few questions. 

I’ve  listened  to  some  of  the  testimony.  I  was  stuck  back  in  my 
office,  but  I  have  been  able  to  hear  some  of  the  questioning,  cer-
tainly  that  of  Senator  Sununu,  Senator  Rockefeller,  and  others, 
Senator  Boxer,  so  I’m  a  little—I’ve  got  some  sense  of  what  has 
transpired here. 

But let me, kind of, touch upon something that I don’t think has 
really been yet established. There’s been some discussion about the 
goal, the President’s goal, and it being a goal, et cetera. The legisla-
tion  that  I  am  a  cosponsor  of,  that  others  here  in  the  Committee 
have joined in on, sets a mandate with respect to that goal, as you 
know,  with  the  clear  understanding  and  belief  from  the  scientific 
community  that  it’s  achievable,  as  many  of  us  believe  it  has  been 
for  some  considerable  period  of  time.  So,  let  me  ask  you  that—I 
mean,  you’re—obviously,  you’re  familiar  with  the  goal.  A  2002  Na-
tional  Academy  of  Sciences  report  shows  that  we  could  easily 
achieve  this  fuel  economy  improvement.  So,  given  the  President’s 
stated goal, can you share with the Committee, why does your pro-
posal  fail  to  set  or  recommend  any  mandatory  improvement  to 
meet the goal? And, given that fact, why should the Committee not, 
therefore, embrace, codifying that goal and setting it? 

Ms. NASON. Thank you, Senator Kerry. 
The  legislation  that  we  sent  up,  the  draft  legislation,  is  very 
similar to the legislation that the administration sent up last year. 
And  last  year,  when  I  was  the  Assistant  Secretary  here  with  Sec-
retary  Mineta,  and  he  testified  in  both  the  House  and  the  Senate, 
there was clear interest on the part of many of the members on the 
panel  to  have  more  of  a  guarantee  that  instead  of  simply  saying, 
‘‘Give  us  the  authority,  give  the  agency  the  authority,  and  we  will 
do a new rulemaking,’’ there was a feeling that we—sense—that we 
needed  to  offer  more,  that  there—there  needed  to  be  a  stronger 
message.  And  so,  the  President,  in  the  State  of  the  Union,  articu-
lated,  as  you  said,  his  goal  of  8.5  billion  gallons  of  gasoline  saved 
in  2017.  The  way  to  get  there  is  a  4  percent  annual  increase  in 
CAFE. However, as the President also noted, the ability to do a full 
cost-benefit  analysis  is  important  to  the  agency.  And  so,  no,  it  is 
not  in—on  any  particular  page  in  our  draft  legislation.  Four  per-
cent  is  a  goal.  It’s  our  target.  But  it  is  not  something  that  we  put 
into  the  legislation,  because  we  did  want  to  have  the  flexibility  to 
review  the  product  plans  by  the  manufacturers,  and  to  do  a  full 
cost-benefit analysis, and to see what is achievable. That is our tar-
get,  and  that  is  what  we  hope  to  achieve,  a  4  percent  annual  in-
crease,  year  over  year,  from  2010  to  2017.  But  it  is  not—you  are 
correct, Senator, it not in the legislation.

Senator  KERRY.  But  some  people  have  tried  to  argue  and  ques-
tion  whether  or  not  NHTSA,  in  fact,  has  the  authority  to  raise 
those  standards.  Do  you—would  you  agree  that  you  have  the  au-
thority? 

Ms. NASON. I believe we have the authority to raise the number. 
As  you  noted,  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  report,  we  do  not 
have  the  authority  to  reform  the  program  for  passenger  cars.  We 
have  it  for  light  trucks.  When  Congress  first  passed  the  statute  in 
1975, there was a distinction between trucks and cars. 

Senator KERRY. Right. 
Ms.  NASON.  And  trucks  being  a  far  smaller  percentage  of  the 
market  than  they  are  now—now  they  are  half,  then  they  were 
about 20 percent—so, we have reformed light truck. We would like 
to  have  the  authority  to  reform  passenger  car  and  increase  the 
stringency. 

Senator  KERRY.  Well,  yes,  but  the  record  on  this  is,  in  fact—I 
mean,  it  may  go  back  to  that  period  of  time  when  the  light  truck/ 
passenger  fleet  was  divided  and  distinguished  differently.  But  the 
fact is that, only a few years ago, we all tried very hard to change 
it  based  on  the  realization  that  that  had—that  balance  had 
changed.  And  we  ran  into  a  buzzsaw  of  opposition.  Senator  Hol-
lings  and  I  introduced  Senate  1926,  which  was  the  National  Fuel 
Savings and Security Act of 2002, and it called for a combined fuel 
economy  average  in  2002—that’s  5  years  ago,  obviously—of  35 
miles  per  gallon  by  2015.  That  became  part  of  the  comprehensive 
energy bill. And then, the industry and others joined together with 
a couple of Senators who brought, you know, an amendment to the 
floor  which  created  this  elaborate  set  of  standards  that  they  gave 
to you. And it struck the Kerry-Hollings provision from the energy 
bill.  So,  we  have  been  trying  to  respond  to  this  for  5  years  now, 
or  more.  You  folks  have,  frankly,  been  way  behind  the  eight  ball 
on it, as you’ve heard from my other colleagues here this morning. 
So,  my  question,  again,  sort  of,  is,  if  the  President  sets  a  goal, 
and  the  goal  is  to  have  any  meaning,  why  would  you  not  require 
an  increase  that  is  clearly  within  the  technological  capacity  of  the 
United States to achieve, and the industry? 

Ms. NASON. Yes, again, thank you, Senator. 
What  we  would  like  to  do  is,  as  you  know,  to  have  4  percent  as 
a  goal.  But  based  on  the  most  updated  product  plans  from  the 
manufacturers, we would like to see what is technologically feasible 
but—— 

Senator KERRY. But haven’t you seen that? 
Ms. NASON.—economically—— 
Senator KERRY. I mean, everybody else has. Are you—aren’t you 
familiar  with  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  studies  and  re-
ports? 

Ms. NASON. Yes, I’m very familiar with them, Senator. 
Senator KERRY. Do you doubt the science? 
Ms.  NASON.  No,  I  think  we  agree  that  basing  reform  on  their 

suggestions is the most responsible way to increase CAFE. 

Senator  KERRY.  Well,  they’ve  basically  laid  out  a  lot  of  the  tech-

nology that’s available now. 

Ms.  NASON.  Yes,  and  we  agree  that  that  report  needs  to  be  up-

dated, based on new technologies, but the NAS has——

49 

Senator  KERRY.  Which  might  even  give  you  better  improve-

ments—— 

Ms. NASON. Yes. 
Senator KERRY.—correct? But just the de minimis improvements 
that they already lay out as feasible are well larger than the range 
that you’re currently talking about. So, why do you have to stop to 
do this analysis? Why not embrace this? 

Ms.  NASON.  The  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  Senator  Kerry, 
was  clear,  in  the  report,  that  they  don’t  endorse  any  particular 
CAFE  number.  They  looked  at  some  of  the  drawbacks  to  the  pro-
gram. It certainly was successful. 

Senator KERRY. Do you know what they said, Ms. Administrator? 
You  know  what  they—sorry  to  interrupt  you—but  in  2001—that’s 
6 years ago now—they found that existing engine technologies were 
inexpensive  enough  to  pay  for  themselves  over  the  life  of  the  vehi-
cle,  and  could  enhance  fuel  economy  by  8  to  11  miles  per  gallon, 
with  no  net  consumer  cost.  And  with  most  fuel  economy  improve-
ments  for  SUVs  and  other  heavier  vehicles,  34  percent  increase 
from  18  to  28.  That’s  what  they  found  in  2001  technology.  Here 
we—— 

Ms. NASON. Yes—— 
Senator  KERRY.—are  in  2007.  You  don’t  think  we  can  do  better? 
Ms.  NASON.—and  our  light  truck  rule  was  a  9  percent  increase. 
The  passenger  car  fleet  is  a  little  bit  higher  than  where  the  light 
truck fleet is. 

Senator KERRY. Right. 
Ms. NASON. So, it is more—— 
Senator KERRY. Well, this has—— 
Ms. NASON.—challenging to—— 
Senator KERRY. Right. 
Ms.  NASON.—increase  fuel  efficiency.  But,  again,  what  we’d  like 
to  do  is  to  do  a  full  reform,  as  NAS  recommended,  and  to  balance 
economic practicability with technological feasibility. 

Senator KERRY. Well, let me ask you, very bluntly, if we were to 
give you sort of a required reform authority—additional reform au-
thority—can  you  assure  the  Committee  that—I  mean,  can  you 
guarantee  the  Congress  that  you  will  require  a  4  percent  per  year 
improvement in fuel economy? 

Ms.  NASON.  Senator,  4  percent,  again,  is  a  goal,  it’s  our  target, 
but  without  having  the  product  plans  and  having  the  benefit  of 
doing  a  full  cost-benefit  analysis,  I  can’t,  today,  tell  you  exactly 
what percentage increase we would see, year over year. 

Senator KERRY. Well, then why—— 
Ms. NASON. That is our goal. 
Senator  KERRY.—did  the  President  put  the  goal  out  there?  I 

mean, this is meaningless. This is just a game. 

Ms.  NASON.  Yes,  sir,  I  think  we  felt  that  having  the  President 
of  the  United  States,  in  the  State  of  the  Union,  address  this  and 
to speak specifically to 8.5 billion gallons of gasoline saved in 2017, 
is—that’s  the  way  to  get  there.  And  we  certainly—the  Secretary’s 
position would be—and the NHTSA Administrator’s position would 
be—that if the President sets that as a goal, you do everything you 
can to meet it. That would be our message today, that we will cer-
tainly  do  everything  we  can  to  meet  it,  but  we’d  like  to  have  the

ability to do a cost-benefit analysis to weigh the technological feasi-
bility  with  the  economic  practicability,  to  look  at  the  impact  of 
other Federal motor vehicle safety standards on CAFE, to consider 
the need for the Nation to conserve energy, all of the statutory re-
quirements  that  we  have  right  now  to  do  a  full  balancing  of  all 
those factors, and then propose a rulemaking. 

Senator KERRY. Well—— 
Ms. NASON. But—— 
Senator  KERRY.—I  think  it’s  all—I  mean,  I  have  to  tell  you,  it’s 
been frustrating, over 22 years, to watch this process, watch it slide 
backward  some  of  those  years,  stay  the  same,  do  worse  than  Eu-
rope  and  other  countries,  watch  the  Japanese  and  Germans  clean 
our  clock  in  the  marketplace,  and  we  just  sit  around  and  play 
games  with  this.  You  could  get  500  miles  per  gallon  if  you  had  a 
hybrid  combined  electric  plug-in  whatever—you  guys  just  don’t  ex-
cite  the  marketplace.  You’re  not  willing  to  challenge  it.  So,  I  just 
think we have to. I really believe that. You know, if you had a mix 
of—I  mean,  if  we  were  to  take  initiatives  to  get  different  fuels  out 
there,  and  different  mixes  for  automobiles,  instead  of  Ford  having 
had  to  lease,  from  Toyota,  the  technology  to  be  able  to  produce  a 
hybrid,  we  might  have  produced  it.  But  there  has  been  no  push 
here,  and  a  complete  avoidance  of  the  reality  that,  when  you  de-
mand  something,  the  marketplace  responds.  If  you  set  a  standard, 
the  marketplace  responds.  And  the  fact  is  that,  you  know,  there 
has  been  this  myopia,  and  it  goes  back  to  the  1960s,  when  Volks-
wagen  first  introduced  the  Bug,  and  everybody  said,  ‘‘Oh,  that’s  a 
niche market, that’s not going to mean anything,’’ and, boom, they 
got  their  clocks  cleaned.  And  it’s  gone  on  one  time  after  another 
after  another.  I  mean,  this  would  be  a  Harvard  Business  School 
case  study  in  bad  management  and  bad  marketing,  in  the  final 
analysis,  having  taken  people  who  had  unbelievable  market  share, 
unbelievable  power  in  the  marketplace,  and  just  ignored  the  con-
sumer realities and desires and a whole bunch of other things. And 
I think the same thing’s happening here, in terms of fuel efficiency. 
Do  you  think  a  consumer—a  mom  with  an  SUV  would  rather 
spend 7,800 bucks on fuel that goes, half of it, to foreign countries, 
or  would  she  rather  spend  a  certain  lesser  percentage  of  that  on 
a new technology that provides jobs and income to Americans? 

Ms. NASON. Well, I am a mom with an SUV. I have a Honda—— 
Senator KERRY. Where would you rather have your money go? 
Ms. NASON.—and I agree that—— 
[Laughter.] 
Senator KERRY. To Saudi Arabia? 
Ms.  NASON.  I  think  the  administration’s  proposal  is—as  the 
President  has  noted,  it’s  a  heavy  technology  bid.  We  have  to  as-
sume,  and  we  would  be  seeing  a  far  greater  penetration  in  the 
fleet,  with  a  4  percent  annual  increase  of  hybrids  and  diesels,  and 
moving forward with improved battery technology to hydrogen fuel 
cell  and  plug-in  vehicles.  That  is  where  the  industry  needs  to  go 
to see greater fuel efficiency levels. We agree with you. 

Senator  KERRY.  So,  why  wouldn’t  you  consider  something  like  a 
$3,000  or  $4,000  per  vehicle  tax  credit  for  purchasers  that  go  out 
and buy that kind of vehicle? You don’t think the industry wouldn’t

leap  at  higher  production  level,  and  consumers  would  leap  at  the 
purchase? 

Ms.  NASON.  I  think  the  administration  has  looked  at—there  are 

multiple ways to—— 

Senator KERRY. But they aren’t doing any of them. I mean, what 

is the plan? What is the plan for meeting the 4 percent goal? 

Ms. NASON. Our target of 4 percent—— 
Senator  KERRY.  Target.  What  is  the  plan  for  meeting  the  4  per-
cent goal—not a target—what is the plan to say to us, ‘‘We’re going 
to meet the 4 percent goal?’’ 

Ms.  NASON.  We  would  treat  reform,  Senator,  the  same  way  we 
treated the light truck reform. We would do the same type of rule-
making.  I’m  not  sure  how  else  to  help  answer  that  question,  other 
than  to  say  that  we  understood—we  understand  that  there  is  a 
great  interest  on  the  part  of  many  of  the  members  to  try  to  find 
assurances  in  the  legislation.  We  did  not  propose  4  percent,  be-
cause,  as  the  President  has  said,  he’d  like  to  let  the  Department 
and the agency have the authority to do a full cost-benefit analysis 
and  to  do  a  full  rulemaking.  But,  again,  it’s  draft  legislation,  so,  if 
there are ways that we can—— 

Senator KERRY. How long have you folks been in office? 
Ms.  NASON.  I’ve  been  the  NHTSA  Administrator  since  last  May. 
Senator KERRY. And how long has the administration been in of-

fice? Since 2001? 

Ms.  NASON.  Yes,  well,  as  was  noted  by  GAO,  we  did  have  a 
freeze  for  some  years  in  Congress  from  making  changes.  But  we 
did initiate a light truck—— 

Senator KERRY. How do you think—— 
Ms. NASON.—rulemaking. 
Senator  KERRY.—that  came  about?  You  know  that  your  rule  on 
the  light  SUVs  reaches  only  2.8  percent  of  the  8.5  million  light 
trucks  that  are  sold  annually.  You  think  that’s  good  enough?  2.8 
percent of the 8.5 million light trucks? 

Ms. NASON. It’s a 2 percent annual increase, and there are some 
manufacturers  who,  under  the  light  truck  rulemaking,  are  at  the 
far  end,  and  will  need  to  make  small  to  no  changes,  because  their 
fuel  efficiency—they’ve  already  invested  in  some  of  those  tech-
nologies,  and  their  fuel  efficiency  levels  are  already  high  enough 
that  our  rulemaking  will  not  force  a  greater  increase.  One  of  the 
things  we’re  trying  to  avoid  in  doing  a  reform  proposal  is  asking 
all  of  the  manufacturers  to  have  the  same  percentage  increase. 
Some of them have already invested in the higher-end technologies, 
and so, we have specifically said we do not want to have a uniform 
percentage  increase  from  all  the  manufacturers.  So,  yes,  there 
would be some, even under a reform passenger car, there would be 
some  manufacturers  who  would  have  to  make  smaller  improve-
ments than others. 

Senator KERRY. Well, Mr. Chairman, I’ve gone over my time, and 
I  appreciate  it.  But,  you  know,  I’m  just—I  think  there’s  such  a— 
I  know  you  sensed  it  from  some  of  my  other  colleagues,  there  is 
such  a  frustration  level  up  here  with  this—the  sort  of  reluctance 
to  excite  the  industry  into  a  new  performance  standard,  buying 
into, I think, some old views of things that are not realistic, meas-
ured  against  what  others  are  doing,  and  measured  against  what

the  science  tells  us  we  could  do.  And  that  resistance  has  cost  us 
a lot, not just in terms of gasoline consumption, oil dependency, but 
also  health,  jobs,  economic  advantage,  I  mean,  a  host  of  other 
things.  I  think  the  myopia  has  been  unbelievably  costly  to  the 
country,  and  I  think  it  would  be  good  for  the  administration—I 
mean,  these  technologies,  we’ve  talked  about  them  here  in  this 
Committee for years. We’ve had any number of people come in and 
give us mix-and-match ways in which this could be done, but some 
people just don’t want to do it. So, they sell a very complicated set 
of  formulae  to  you  and  to  others,  and  people  don’t  do  it.  And  the 
result  is,  we  are  where  we  are,  but  I  think  it’s  time  for  us,  some-
how,  to  seize  the  baton  here  and  try  to  get  something  done  that’s 
more realistic. 

And  obviously  none  of  us  want  to  lose  jobs.  We  don’t  want  to 
make an industry noncompetitive. I understand that, which is why 
I  proposed,  2  years  ago,  putting  a  billion  dollars,  flat,  right  up 
front,  into  the  industry,  help  them  retool,  put  it  into  the  plant  re-
tooling,  put  it  into  the  ability  to  be  able  to  do  this,  not  to  mention 
the  tax  credits  you  could  give  for  the  purchase  of  the  vehicles  or 
the  assistance  you  could  give  in  putting  E85  into  gas  stations  and 
a whole bunch of things. It would change the entire demand curve 
of our country. 

I’m  not  saying  any  one  of  those  is  the  best  thing  to  do,  or  100 
percent  correct,  but  I  know  this,  we’re  not  doing  any  of  it.  We  are 
just  nibbling  at  the  margins  in  the  most  timid  and  reluctant  and 
ineffective  way.  And  it’s  costing  us  market  share,  and  it’s  costing 
us  jobs,  and  it’s  costing  us  health  costs  and—asthma  and  other 
things  from  the  air  quality.  You  name  it.  We’re  not  even  meeting 
those standards. 

So,  I  hope  you  all  will,  you  know,  do  something.  But,  in  the 

meantime, I hope we will, Mr. Chairman. Thanks. 

Senator PRYOR [presiding]. Thank you, Senator Kerry.

And  you  all  come  up  and  take  your  seats,  and  I’ll  go  ahead  and 
introduce  you.  And  I  know  many  of  you,  if  not  all,  have  opening

tions after that.

STATEMENT  OF  DAVID  FRIEDMAN,  RESEARCH  DIRECTOR, 
CLEAN  VEHICLES  PROGRAM,  UNION  OF  CONCERNED 
SCIENTISTS 
Mr. FRIEDMAN. Great, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll do my best. 
Recently,  the  country  has  reached  a  really  important  fuel  econ-
omy  milestone.  Leaders  in  Congress,  including  Chairman  Inouye 
and several members of this committee and the President, are basi-
cally in agreement with how far we should go to increase fuel econ-
omy  standards  over  the  next  10  years.  The  President’s  8.5-billion- 
gallon  conservation  goal  and  the  ‘‘Ten-in-Ten’’  fuel  economy  bill 
would  both  require  a  fuel  economy  improvement  of  about  34  to  35 
miles  per  gallon  in  10  years.  While  these  targets  and  dates  are 
slightly  different,  the  oil  savings  from  both  would  be  about  the 
same, about 1.4 million barrels of oil per day in 2020. Basically, the 
‘‘Ten-in-Ten’’  bill  would  make  the  President’s  goal  the  law  of  the 
land. 

Now,  I  think  this  general  agreement  on  goals  means  that  what 
we  really  need  to  do  now  is  focus  on  how  to  get  there.  And  obvi-
ously  that’s  the  devil  in  the  details.  By  reforming  and  strength-
ening fuel economy standards, this committee has a significant op-
portunity to cut our oil addiction, to save consumers money, to cre-
ate  jobs,  and,  very  importantly,  to  tackle  global  warming.  Global 
warming  is  the  single  largest  environmental  challenge  we  face 
today.  And  our  cars  and  trucks  have  impacts  that  are  worldwide 
in  scale.  They  require  special  attention  because  of  that.  Only  the 
entire  economies  of  the  United  States,  China,  and  Russia  produce 
more global warming pollution than just our cars and trucks. Those 
vehicles  also  are  responsible  for  40  percent  of  our  oil  addiction.  In 
fact,  we  import  about  60  percent  of  our  oil  and  pay  about  $60  per 
barrel  today.  That’s  over  $700  million  per  day,  $500,000  per 
minute,  leaving  this  country,  that  could  have,  instead,  been  spent 
to create U.S. jobs and strengthen our economy. 

Now, one of the main reasons why cars and trucks contribute so 
much  to  oil  dependence  and  global  warming  is  that  the  average 
fuel economy of the new car and truck sold in 2006 was lower than 
it  was  in  1986.  Fuel  economy  standards  can  reverse  this  trend  by 
steering  automakers  to  use  existing  technology  to  put  more  high 
fuel  economy  choices  on  showroom  floors.  We  can’t  afford  to  wait 
for hybrids, fuel cells, plug-ins, or alternative fuels to address these 
problems,  when  we  have  technology  already  in  the  hands  of  auto-
makers. 

Technologies  already  on  the  shelf  could  be  used  across  the  fleet 
to  reach  more  than  40  miles  per  gallon  in  the  next  10  years.  But 
today  automakers  mainly  offer  compacts  and  a  few  family  cars  to 
consumers  who  want  higher  fuel  economy.  That  leaves  a  mother 
with  three  children  in  car  seats,  or  a  farmer  who  needs  a  work 
truck, with no gas-sipping choices.

Consumers  aren’t  the  only  ones  who  are  missing  out.  A  2006 
study  from  the  University  of  Michigan  shows  that  Detroit’s  Big 
Three  could  increase—increase  profits  by  $1.3  billion  in  2010  if 
they  invest  in  fuel  economy,  even  if  gasoline  costs  only  $2  per  gal-
lon.  There’s  a  real  opportunity  here.  Existing  technologies  could 
create over 160,000 new jobs throughout the economy. In the auto-
motive  sector  alone  we  could  see  an  increase  of  over  40,000  new 
jobs. These jobs would be created by investing in better technology 
and  because  consumers  would  be  spending  less  money  on  oil  and 
more money here in America. 

Now,  if  the  country  is  to  realize  these  benefits,  we  recommend 
that  Congress  take  the  following  three  steps.  First,  Congress 
should  establish  a  concrete  fuel-economy  target  to  guarantee  that 
the  President’s  oil  savings  goal  is  met.  We  have  to  guarantee  that 
that  happens.  Adopting  the  ‘‘Ten-in-Ten’’  bill  would  achieve  this 
goal, and, by 2027, would save as much oil as we currently import 
from the entire Persian Gulf. 

Congress  should  not  cede  this  authority  to  NHTSA.  NHTSA  has 
not  come  through  when  setting  the  magnitude  of  fuel  economy 
standards.  They  have  reformed  the  system  for  light  trucks  and 
brought  in  size-based  systems,  which  is  a  positive  move,  but  the 
magnitude of their increase will save less than 2 weeks of gasoline 
each year from the most recent rule. And in—this is, in large part, 
because  NHTSA  is  just  not  the  right  place  to  estimate  the  value 
of  things  like  global  warming  pollution  and  oil  dependence.  Con-
gress  is  the  right  place  to  show  what  consumers  and  the  public 
think we should do about those problems. 

Now, second, Congress should provide NHTSA with the authority 
to  extend  these  size-based  standards  to  cars.  This  will  give  manu-
facturers, who make everything from compact cars to large pickups, 
the flexibility they have been asking for. 

Under  the  ‘‘Ten-in-Ten’’  bill,  with  size-based  standards,  this 
would mean a pickup would only have to meet 28 miles per gallon, 
not  the  35  mile  per  gallon  standard.  The  technology  is  out  there 
to do that while saving consumers money. 

Now,  finally,  this  pickup  truck,  of  course,  would  have  the  same 
size,  the  same  performance,  and  the  same,  or  even  better,  safety 
than  we  have  today  by  tapping  into  these  existing  technologies. 
Now  of  course  this  is  going  to  require  investments  from  auto-
makers. And since the country is going to get a significant amount 
of  benefits  from  increased  fuel  economy  standards,  in  return  for 
these  improvements,  Congress  could  provide  incentives  to  compa-
nies that invest in the equipment and the people who will be need-
ed to make these more fuel-efficient vehicles. 

At the end of the day, high oil and gasoline prices and continued 
increases  in  our  oil  addiction  represent  significant  threats  to  our 
country,  our  economy,  the  climate,  and  U.S.  auto  jobs.  Congress 
can do something about these problems by taking a leadership role 
on fuel economy. 

Thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID FRIEDMAN, RESEARCH DIRECTOR, CLEAN VEHICLES 

PROGRAM, UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS 

55 

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  would  like  to  thank  you  for  the 
opportunity to testify before you today. I am a research director and senior engineer 
with the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). UCS is a leading science-based non-
profit  that  has  been  working  for  a  healthy  environment  and  a  safer  world  for  over 
30 years. 

I want to begin today by saying that I think we have reached an important mile-
stone  on  fuel  economy.  It  would  appear  that  some  leaders  in  Congress,  including 
Members  of  this  Committee,  and  the  president  are  basically  in  agreement  on  how 
far we should increase fuel economy standards in about a 10-year period. 

In the President’s State of the Union speech, he set a goal for America to conserve 
up  to  8.5  billion  gallons  of  gasoline  by  2017.  To  do  so,  we  would  need  to  increase 
fuel  economy  standards  for  cars  and  trucks  to  about  34  miles  per  gallon  by  2017, 
or  about  4  percent  per  year.  At  the  same  time,  the  bill  recently  introduced  by  the 
Chairman  and  many  members  of  this  committee  establishes  a  fuel  economy  target 
of  35  mpg  by  2019.  Figure  1  shows  the  oil  savings  benefits  of  the  existing  Senate 
bills  and  the  President’s  8.5  billion  gallon  goal.  The  oil  savings  benefits  of  S.  357 
are  almost  the  same  as  the  President’s  goal.  Other  members  of  the  Senate  and 
House have put forth bills with similar requirements in this and recent years. 

In  addition,  Senator  Stevens,  has  introduced  a  bill  to  raise  fuel  economy  stand-
ards for passenger cars to 40 mpg by 2017, or about a 39 percent increase compared 
to the average fuel economy of cars today. If Senator Stevens applied the same im-
provement  to  the  rest  of  the  fleet,  it  would  average  just  over  34  mpg  by  2017.  As 
it stands, the oil savings from S. 183 are half of the others since only half the fleet 
is included. 

I  consider  this  a  milestone  because  this  significant  agreement  on  fuel  economy 
goals  means  that  we  can  focus  now  on  how  best  to  reach  them.  By  reforming  and 
strengthening fuel economy standards for cars and trucks, this committee has a sig-
nificant opportunity to help cut our oil addiction, save consumers money, create new 
jobs,  and  tackle  the  largest  long  term  environmental  threat  facing  the  country  and 
the world today, global warming. 
Global Warming 

Carbon  dioxide,  the  main  heat  trapping  gas  blanketing  our  planet  and  warming 
the Earth, has reached a concentration of about 380 parts per million. That is high-
er than the globe has experienced in the past 650,000 years. We are already seeing 
the  impacts  of  these  elevated  concentrations  as  eleven  of  the  last  12  years  rank 
among the 12 hottest on record (IPCC, 2007).1 

The  worldwide  costs  of  global  warming  could  reach  at  least  5  percent  of  global 
GDP each year if we fail to take steps to cut emissions (Stern Review, 2006). These 
costs  would  come  in  lives  and  resources  as  tropical  diseases  and  agricultural  pests 
move  north  due  to  our  warming  continent.  These  costs  could  also  come  from  losing 
60–80  percent  of  the  snow  cover  in  the  Sierras  by  the  end  of  the  century  and  the 
resulting  impacts  on  agriculture  in  California  and  similar  states  that  rely  on  snow 
melt  for  water.  We  will  also  see  increased  asthma  and  lung  disease  because  higher 
temperatures will make urban smog worse than it is today. 

Global  warming  is  a  worldwide  problem  and  our  cars  and  trucks  have  impacts 
that are worldwide in scale. Only the entire economies of the United States, China, 
and Russia exceed the global warming pollution resulting from our cars and trucks 
alone. It is clear that the scope of pollution from our cars and trucks requires special 
attention as we begin to address climate change. 
Oil Addiction 

In addition to the costs created by the pollution from our cars and trucks, our ve-
hicles  also  contribute  to  40  percent  of  our  oil  addiction.  Overall,  data  from  the  En-
ergy  Information  Administration  indicates  that  we  imported  about  sixty  percent  of 
our oil and other petroleum products in 2006. Last year alone, our net imports were 
more  than  12  million  barrels  per  day.  When  oil  is  at  $60  per  barrel,  every  minute 
that passes means over $500,000 that could have been spent creating U.S. jobs and 
strengthening our economy instead leaves this country. At the end of the day, high 
oil  and  gasoline  prices  and  continued  increases  in  our  oil  addiction  represent  one 
of the single biggest threats to U.S. auto jobs today. 

1 Reliable  records  began  in  1850,  when  sufficient  worldwide  temperature  measurements 

began.

Fuel Economy Background 

One  of  the  main  reasons  our  vehicles  contribute  so  much  to  U.S.  oil  dependence 
and  global  warming  is  that  the  average  fuel  economy  of  the  fleet  of  new  cars  and 
trucks  sold  in  the  U.S.  in  2006  was  lower  than  it  was  in  1986.  And  while  auto-
makers  note  the  number  of  models  on  the  market  that  get  more  than  30  miles  per 
gallon  on  the  highway,  a  look  at  EPA’s  2007  fuel  economy  guide  shows  that  there 
are more than 300 car and truck configurations that get 15 mpg or less in the city.2 
Even if you exclude pickups and work vans, automakers still flood the market with 
nearly 200 car, minivan, and SUV configurations that get 15 mpg or less in the city. 
Consumers  simply  do  not  have  enough  high  fuel  economy  choices  when  it  comes  to 
cars, minivans, SUVs and pickups. 

Fuel economy standards were created to solve this exact problem. Just as we see 
today,  automakers  were  not  ready  for  the  problems  created  in  part  by  our  gas  guz-
zling in the early 1970s. As a result consumers jumped on the only option they had 
at  the  time,  relatively  poorly  designed  smaller  cars.  However,  as  fuel  economy 
standards  were  fully  phased  in  automakers  switched  from  giving  consumers  poor 
choices to putting technology in all cars and trucks so car buyers could have options 
in the showroom with 70 percent higher fuel economy than they had in 1975 (2006 
EPA  Fuel  Economy  Trends  Report).  If  the  fuel  economy  of  today’s  cars  and  trucks 
was at the level the fleet experienced in 1975 instead of today’s 25 miles per gallon, 
we would be using an additional 80 billion gallons of gasoline on top of the 140 bil-
lion  gallons  we  will  use  this  year.  That  would  represent  an  increase  in  oil  demand 
by  5.2  million  barrels  of  oil  per  day,  or  a  25  percent  increase  in  our  oil  addiction. 
At today’s average price for regular gasoline, about $2.50 per gallon, that represents 
$200 billion saved. That number could have been much better, however, if fuel econ-
omy  standards  had  not  remained  essentially  unchanged  for  the  past  two  decades. 
Technology to Create Consumer Choice 

Driving in America has become a necessity. Because of this and a lack of options, 
even  the  spikes  in  gasoline  prices  over  the  past  5  years  have  not  been  enough  to 
push  consumers  to  significantly  reduce  their  gasoline  consumption.3 Better  fuels 
and  more  alternatives  to  driving  are  important  to  helping  consumers  and  cutting 
pollution,  but  the  quickest  route  to  reduced  gasoline  consumption  and  saving  con-
sumers money is put to more high fuel economy choices in the showroom. 

The automobile industry has been developing technologies that can safely and eco-
nomically  allow  consumers  to  get  more  miles  to  the  gallon  in  cars,  minivans, 
pickups  and  SUVs  of  all  shapes  and  sizes.  Figure  2  shows  the  potential  for  these 
technologies to dramatically increase the fuel economy of an SUV with the size and 
acceleration  of  a  Ford  Explorer.  This  could  be  achieved  using  direct  injection  gaso-
line  engines,  high  efficiency  automatic  manual  transmissions,  engines  that  shut  off 
instead  of  wasting  fuel  while  idling,  improved  aerodynamics,  better  tires  and  other 
existing  efficiency  technologies.  These  technologies  have  no  influence  on  the  safety 
of  the  vehicle.  Others,  such  as  high-strength  steel  and  aluminum  and  unibody  con-
struction could actually help make highways safer. 

For  just  over  $2,500  a  consumer  could  have  the  choice  of  an  SUV  that  gets  more 
than  35  mpg.  This  is  an  SUV  that  alone  could  meet  the  fuel  economy  targets  laid 
out by Members of this committee and the President. At $2.50 per gallon, this SUV 
would  save  consumers  over  $7,800  on  fuel  costs  during  the  vehicle’s  lifetime.  The 
technologies  needed  for  this  better  SUV  would  even  pay  for  themselves  in  about  3 
years.  Automakers  do  already  have  vehicles  on  the  road  that  can  match  this  fuel 
economy,  but  most  are  compact  cars.  That  leaves  a  mother  with  three  children  in 
car-seats  or  a  farmer  who  needs  a  work  truck  with  few  vehicle  choices  until  these 
technologies  are  packaged  into  higher  fuel  economy  minivans,  SUVs,  pickups  and 
other vehicles. 

The  technologies  in  this  better  SUV  could  be  used  across  the  fleet  to  reach  more 
than  40  miles  per  gallon  over  the  next  10  years.  The  2002  study  by  the  National 
Academies  on  CAFE  showed  similar  results.  Data  in  the  report  indicate  that  the 
technology  exists  to  reach  37  mpg  in  a  fleet  of  the  same  make-up  as  the  NAS  ana-
lyzed, even ignoring hybrids and cleaner diesels. (NRC, 2002) 

2 The  EPA  fuel  economy  guide  configurations  separate  out  two-  and  four-wheel  drive  and  dif-
ferent  engine  sizes  for  each  model.  The  number  of  models  getting  less  than  15  mpg  in  the  city 
will therefore be lower. 

3 A recent University of California, Davis study concluded that consumers’ short term response 
to  gasoline  prices  has  dropped  by  more  than  a  factor  of  four  since  the  1970s.  (Hughes,  Knittel, 
and  Sperling,  2006)  Data  from  the  past  5  years  indicates  that  a  consumer  would  only  decrease 
gasoline consumption by 3.4 to 7.7 percent in response to a doubling of gasoline prices compared 
to a 21 to 34 percent reduction in the late 1970s.

The  question  now  is  whether  automakers  will  use  these  tools  to  increase  fuel 
economy.  Automakers  have  spent  the  past  twenty  years  using  similar  technologies 
to  nearly  double  power  and  increase  weight  by  twenty-five  percent  instead  of  in-
creasing  fuel  economy.  (EPA  Fuel  Economy  Trends  Report,  2006)  As  a  result,  con-
sumers  today  have  cars  and  trucks  with  race-car  like  acceleration  and  plenty  of 
room for children, pets and weekend projects. What consumers need now is to keep 
the size and performance they have today, while getting higher fuel economy. With-
out  increased  fuel  economy  standards,  however,  this  future  is  unlikely.  We  are  al-
ready  seeing  automakers  market  muscle  hybrids,  vehicles  that  use  hybrid  tech-
nology for increased power instead of increased fuel economy. And technologies such 
as  cylinder  cut-off,  which  increases  fuel  economy  by  shutting  off  engine  cylinders 
when drivers need less power, are being used to offset increased engine power rath-
er than increased fleetwide fuel economy. 

This committee is in a position to ensure that consumers can keep the power, size 
and  safety  they  have  in  their  vehicles  today,  and  save  thousands  of  dollars  while 
cutting  both  global  warming  pollution  and  our  oil  addiction  through  deployment  of 
technology aimed at better fuel economy across the vehicle fleet. 
Economic and Employment Impacts of Setting Fuel Economy Targets 

Contrary to claims by the auto industry, investments in fuel economy technology, 
just  like  other  investments  in  the  economy,  will  lead  to  prosperity.  No  automaker 
would  simply  shut  down  a  plant  if  it  was  making  gas  guzzlers  that  don’t  meet  na-
tional fuel economy targets. Instead, they would make investments to upgrade their 
tooling to build more fuel efficient vehicles. A 2006 study from Walter McManus at 
the University of Michigan shows that automakers that invest in fuel economy, even 
as  early  as  2010,  will  improve  their  competitive  position  (Can  Proactive  Fuel  Econ-
omy Strategies Help Automakers Mitigate Fuel-Price Risks?). According to the study, 
Detroit’s  Big  Three  could  increase  profits  by  $1.3  billion  if  they  invest  in  fuel  econ-
omy,  even  if  gasoline  costs  only  $2  per  gallon.  However,  if  they  follow  a  business- 
as-usual approach their lost profits could be as large as $3.6 billion if gasoline costs 
$3.10 a gallon. 

UCS  has  also  sought  to  quantify  the  benefits  of  increased  fuel  economy.  (Fried-
man, 2004, Creating Jobs, Saving Energy and Protecting the Environment) We esti-
mated  the  effect  of  moving  existing  technologies  into  cars  and  trucks  over  10  years 
to reach an average of 40 miles per gallon (mpg). We found that: 
• In 10 years, the benefits resulting from investments in fuel economy would lead 
to  161,000  more  jobs  throughout  the  country,  with  California,  Michigan,  New 
York, Florida, Ohio, and Illinois topping the list. 

• In the automotive sector, projected jobs would grow by 40,800 in 10 years. 
A  similar  analysis  done  by  the  economic-research  firm  Management  Information 
Services  (MIS)  evaluated  the  potential  job  impacts  of  increasing  fuel  economy  to 
about 35–36 mpg by 2015 and found even greater growth at more than 350,000 new 
jobs  in  2015.  (Bezdek,  2005,  Fuel  Efficiency  and  the  Economy)  This  job  growth  in-
cluded all of the major auto industry states. 

In  both  the  UCS  and  the  MIS  studies  these  new  jobs  would  be  created  both  be-
cause of investments in new technologies by the automakers and because consumers 
would  shift  spending  away  from  gasoline  to  more  productive  products  and  services. 
Requiring all automakers to improve fuel economy will increase the health of the 
industry.  Companies  like  Ford,  General  Motors  and  the  Chrysler  division  are  cur-
rently in bad financial condition due to poor management decisions and elevated gas 
prices, not fuel economy standards, which have been stagnant for the past two dec-
ades.  Those  poor  decisions  have  put  them  in  a  place  where,  just  as  in  the  1970s, 
they do not have the products consumers need at a time of increased gasoline prices, 
and  they  are  continuing  the  slide  in  market  share  that  began  the  first  time  they 
made this mistake. 

By  requiring  Ford,  GM,  Chrysler  and  all  automakers  give  consumers  the  choices 
they  need,  Congress  can  ensure  automaker  jobs  stay  in  the  U.S.  and  models  like 
the Ford Explorer and Chevrolet Tahoe are still on the market 10 years from now— 
though they will go farther on a gallon of gas. 
Safety Impacts of Setting Fuel Economy Targets 

While  the  NAS  study  clearly  states  that  fuel  economy  can  be  increased  with  no 
impact  on  the  safety  of  our  cars  and  trucks,  critics  of  fuel  economy  standards  often 
point to the chapter, which takes a retrospective look at safety. Despite the fact that 
this  chapter  did  not  represent  a  consensus  of  the  Committee  (a  dissenting  opinion 
from  two  panel  members  was  included  in  the  appendices)  and  the  fact  that  three 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  08:33 Apr 16, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00061 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80088.TXT JACKIE

58 

major  analyses  have  since  shown  that  fuel  economy  and  safety  are  not  inherently 
linked, claims are still made to the contrary. 

First,  David  Greene  (one  of  the  NAS  panel  members)  produced  a  report  with 
Sanjana Ahmad in 2004 (The Effect of Fuel Economy on Automobile Safety: A Reex-
amination),  which  demonstrates  that  fuel  economy  is  not  linked  with  increased  fa-
talities.  In  fact,  the  report  notes  that,  ‘‘higher  mpg  is  significantly  correlated  with 
fewer fatalities.’’ In other words, a thorough analysis of data from 1966 to 2002 indi-
cates  that  Congress  can  likely  increase  fuel  economy  without  harming  safety  if  the 
past is precept. 

Second,  Marc  Ross  and  Tom  Wenzel  produced  a  report  in  2002  (An  Analysis  of 
Traffic  Deaths  by  Vehicle  Type  and  Model),  which  demonstrates  that  large  vehicles 
do  not  have  lower  fatality  rates  when  compared  to  smaller  vehicles.  Ross  and 
Wenzel  analyzed  Federal  accident  data  between  1995  and  1999  and  showed  that, 
for  example,  the  Honda  Civic  and  VW  Jetta  both  had  lower  fatality  rates  for  the 
driver  than  the  Ford  Explorer,  the  Dodge  Ram,  or  the  Toyota  4Runner.  Even  the 
largest vehicles, the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban had fatality rates that were no 
better  than  the  VW  Jetta  or  the  Nissan  Maxima.  In  other  words,  a  well-designed 
compact  car  can  be  safer  than  an  SUV  or  a  pickup.  Design,  rather  than  weight,  is 
the key to safe vehicles. 

Finally,  a  study  by  Van  Auken  and  Zellner  in  2003  (A  Further  Assessment  of  the 
Effects of Vehicle Weight and Size Parameters on Fatality Risk In Model Year 1985– 
98 Passenger Cars and 1985–97 Light Trucks) indicates that increased weight is as-
sociated  with  increased  fatalities,  while  increased  size  is  associated  with  decreased 
fatalities.  While  this  study  was  not  able  to  bring  in  the  impacts  of  design  as  well 
as  size,  it  helped  inform  NHTSA  as  they  rejected  weight-based  standards  in  favor 
of size-based standards based on the vehicle footprint. 

These  studies  further  back  up  Congress’  ability  to  set  fuel  economy  targets  as 
high as 40 mpg for the fleet in the next 10 years without impacting highway safety. 
Getting Fuel Economy Policy Right 

Given  broader  agreement  on  how  far  fuel  economy  must  increase,  we  now  need 
policies to lay out how to get there. Congress should follow four key steps to ensure 
that the country gets the benefits of existing fuel economy technology: 
• Establish a concrete fuel economy goal 
• Provide NHTSA with additional flexibility to establish size based standards 
• Institute a backstop to ensure that the fuel savings benefits are realized 
• Provide consumers and/or automakers with economic incentives to invest in tech-

nology for increased fuel economy 

Set a Target of 34–35 mpg 

Congress  can  set  a  standard  either  meeting  the  President’s  goals  of  34  mpg  by 
2017  or  35  mpg  by  2019  as  in  S.  357.  Both  of  these  fuel  economy  levels  are  sup-
ported by the guidance requested and received from the NAS and UCS analysis. By 
doing  adopting  S.  357,  Congress  would  cut  global  warming  pollution  by  more  than 
230  million  metric  tons  by  2020,  the  equivalent  of  taking  more  than  30  million  of 
today’s  automobiles  off  the  road.  The  bill  would  also  cut  oil  dependency  by  2.3  mil-
lion barrels of oil per day in 2027, as much oil as we currently import from the Per-
sian Gulf. 

The key to reaching these goals, however, is that Congress must set these targets 
and not leave it up to NHTSA. NHTSA has proven to have a poor track record when 
setting  fuel  economy  standards  so  far.  Their  recent  rulemaking  on  light  trucks  will 
save  less  than  2  weeks  of  gasoline  each  year  for  the  next  two  decades.  This  hap-
pened  in  part  because  they  did  not  value  the  important  benefits  of  cutting  oil  de-
pendence  and  reducing  global  warming  pollution  from  cars  and  trucks.  By  setting 
specific standards based on where technology can take us, Congress can make clear 
the  importance  of  tackling  these  important  problems  which  are  hard  to  quantify 
analytically,  but  easy  to  qualify  based  on  consumer  discontent  with  gasoline  prices 
last summer, political instability from dependence on oil from the Persian Gulf, and 
the surge in concern over global warming. 

Congress  should  not  defer  its  regulatory  authority  to  the  Administration  and  it 
need not as it can base such standards on the scientific research it requested. Con-
gress can be confident that the goals are technically feasible, cost effective, and safe. 
Provide NHTSA Authority to Establish Size-Based Standards 

The  bills  in  the  Senate  and  the  President’s  plans  include  the  ability  for  NHTSA 
to set car and light truck standards based on vehicle attributes such as vehicle size. 
These size-based standards give manufacturers who make everything from compact

cars to minivans to large pickups the flexibility they have been asking for and elimi-
nate  any  arguments  automakers  have  made  about  CAFE  standards  treating  them 
inequitably. 

Size-based standards designed to increase fleet fuel economy to 35 mpg might re-
quire  a  family  car  to  reach  40  mpg,  but  a  pickup  would  only  have  to  reach  about 
28 mpg because it is larger. This is good news for farmers and contractors who rely 
on these vehicles. With existing technology, pickups could readily reach 28 mpg and 
would  save  their  owners  over  $6,000  on  gasoline  during  the  life  of  the  vehicle.  The 
pickup  would  have  the  same  power,  performance,  size  and  safety  it  has  today,  and 
would cost an additional $1,500. However, the added fuel economy technology would 
pay  for  itself  in  less  than  2  years  with  gasoline  at  $2.50  per  gallon.  Higher  fuel 
economy  standards  will  help  farmers  and  small  businesses  who  rely  on  trucks  as 
much or even more than the average consumer. 
Ensure No Backsliding 

The  one  challenge  with  size-based  standards  is  that  automakers  can  game  the 
system  and  drive  down  fuel  economy.  Much  as  automakers  switched  to  marketing 
SUVs  because  of  the  lower  standards  required  of  light  trucks  to  date,  automakers 
may also upsize their vehicles to classes with lower fuel economy targets when they 
redesign  their  vehicles  every  4  to  7  years.  Our  analysis  of  NHTSA’s  most  recent 
light truck rule shows that we could lose as much as half of the promised fuel econ-
omy gains, as small as they are, if the fleet of light trucks increased in size by just 
10 percent over 10 years. Congress must require a backstop to ensure that fuel sav-
ings that would be generated from a 10 mpg fuel economy increase are not lost due 
to automakers who game the system. 
Provide Incentives 

Because increased fuel economy will provide a wide variety of benefits for the Na-
tion, it is in the Nation’s interest to help automakers and suppliers who make cars 
and  trucks  in  the  U.S.  that  go  farther  on  a  gallon  of  gasoline.  One  way  to  help  the 
auto industry is to provide tax credits, loan guarantees, or grants to companies that 
guarantee  fuel  economy  improvements  by  investing  in  the  equipment  and  people 
who  will  be  needed  to  make  these  more  efficient  vehicles.  This  policy  could  be  fur-
ther  supported  by  a  set  of  charges  and  rebates  applied  to  vehicles  based  on  their 
fuel economy. These ‘‘feebates’’ will send market signals to producers and consumers 
in support of higher fuel economy standards and can even be made revenue neutral. 
Conclusions 

Climate  change  represents  the  largest  long-term  environmental  threat  facing  our 
country and the world today and the costs of our oil addiction continue to grow. Set-
ting  a  fleet-wide  target  sufficient  to  meet  the  President’s  goal  and  guarantee  fuel 
economy  improvements  of  at  least  10  mpg  over  the  next  decade  while  giving  the 
President the authority to reach that target through size-based standards will save 
consumers  money,  stimulate  the  economy,  create  and  protect  jobs  and  preserve  the 
safety  of  our  vehicles.  All  of  these  benefits  will  come  in  addition  to  cutting  our  oil 
dependence  and  emissions  of  global  warming  pollutants  from  our  cars  and  trucks. 
Consumers  are  clearly  happy  with  the  size  and  acceleration  of  their  vehicles 
today.  We  don’t  have  to  change  that.  But  consumers  are  clearly  unhappy  with  the 
growing impacts of global warming and the high cost of gasoline and the pumps and 
on our economy and security. 

Congress  has  the  opportunity  to  ensure  that  automakers  spend  the  next  decade 
or  more  using  technology  to  curb  our  oil  addiction.  This  is  not  a  surprising  role  for 
Congress, the Federal Government has helped drive every major transportation rev-
olution  this  country  has  seen,  whether  it  was  trains,  planes,  or  automobiles.  The 
next transition will be no different. 

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today.  I  would  be  happy  to  answer  any 

questions you may have. 

I have attached several fact sheets to provide additional background information.

Union of Concerned Scientists—Fact Sheet—January 2007 

S. 357—The Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Bill 

In  the  midst  of  high  gasoline  prices  and  continuing  unrest  in  many  oil-producing 
regions of the world, our country’s vulnerability to its growing dependence on oil has 
been  laid  bare.  The  Ten-in-Ten  bill  directs  the  administration  to  save  consumers 
money  and  cut  projected  oil  demand  from  cars,  SUVs,  minivans  and  pickups  by  10 
percent  in  2019.  This  is  achieved  by  a  modest  fuel  economy  increase  that  would 
raise  the  fleet  of  new  vehicles  from  today’s  24.6  mpg  to  35  mpg  by  2019  while  pro-
tecting highway safety and U.S. auto industry jobs. 

Figure  1  shows  the  amount  of  money  consumers  would  save  annually  through 
2025, even after accounting for a modest increase in vehicle price to cover fuel-sav-
ing  technologies.  In  addition  to  saving  consumers  money  at  the  pump,  the  Ten-in- 
Ten bill would reduce the Nation’s dependence on oil and significantly cut the emis-
sions of global warming pollution from cars and light trucks (Table 1). The reduction 
in oil demand in 2025 is equal to our current imports from the Persian Gulf.

The  Ten-in-Ten  bill  would  give  NHTSA  the  authority  to  set  size-based  standards 
for  all  vehicles,  as  the  President  requested  in  2006.  When  coupled  with  an  overall 
target for improving the fleet average and a backstop to prevent the erosion of fuel 
economy gains, size-based standards can give the auto industry increased flexibility 
in complying with the strengthened standards. 

In  a  time  of  high  gas  prices,  the  technologies  available  to  increase  fuel  economy 
are  more  cost  effective  than  ever.  A  package  of  modest,  proven  conventional  tech-
nologies is all that would be needed to meet a standard of 35 mpg. Today’s size and 
acceleration  could  remain  the  same  and  safety  could  be  improved.  The  technologies 
would  add  about  $1,100  to  the  price  of  an  average  vehicle  in  2019,  an  investment

that would be recovered in less than 3 years of driving, assuming that gasoline costs 
$2.00  per  gallon.  Over  the  lifetime  of  the  vehicle  the  owner  would  save  a  total  of 
more than $3,600 in gasoline costs. 

Union of Concerned Scientists—Fact Sheet—May 2006 

FUEL ECONOMY AND LIGHT TRUCK TECHNOLOGY 

There are many technologies available to cost-effectively improve the fuel economy 
of  sport-utility  vehicles  (SUVs),  pickups,  and  minivans—whether  used  for  hauling, 
off-road travel, or the trip to the supermarket. Because these technologies have been 
left  on  the  shelf  for  so  long,  there  is  an  even  greater  potential  to  improve  the  fuel 
economy of light trucks compared to cars. 
Improving Light Truck Fuel Economy 

The Union of Concerned Scientists has investigated the best ways to increase the 
fuel economy of SUVs, pickups and minivans. In each case, vehicle fuel economy po-
tential  was  evaluated  while  providing  the  same  performance,  comfort  and  safety 
that  consumers  have  today.  We  found  that  several  packages  of  cost-effective  tech-
nologies can be employed to save consumers money and increase fuel economy while 
giving consumers the performance and features they expect today. 

Near-Term  Gains.  Using  technologies  available  on  some  of  today’s  cars,  the  aver-
age  fuel  economy  of  SUVs,  pickups,  and  minivans  could  easily  be  increased  to  28 
miles per gallon (mpg) while maintaining acceleration, towing capacity, and comfort 
along with improved safety. That would put light trucks above today’s car fuel econ-
omy  standard  for  less  than  $800.1 These  vehicles  would  save  consumers  more  than 
$3,900  at  the  gas  pump  over  their  lifetimes  compared  to  vehicles  meeting  the  cur-
rent  standard  of  21.6  mpg—these  savings  are  nearly  five  times  the  cost  of  the  fuel 
economy  improvements.2 In  other  words,  for  less  than  the  cost  of  air  conditioning 
(or a 6-disc CD sound system), we could save consumers thousands of dollars while 
closing  the  light  truck  loophole  that  allows  the  average  light  truck  to  guzzle  more 
than 30 percent more fuel than the average car. 

Ten  Years  Away.  If  a  more  significant  investment,  around  $2,600,  is  made  to  in-
crease  the  fuel  economy  of  our  SUVs,  pickups,  and  minivans,  their  average  fuel 
economy  could  reach  36  mpg  using  technologies  that  could  be  in  mass  production 
within the next 10 years. Consumers would see benefits of nearly $7,000 in savings 
at the gasoline pump during the vehicle’s lifetime. 
Safety Benefits 

Most  of  the  near-term  improvements  in  the  fuel  economy  of  light  trucks  can  be 
accomplished  through  optimizing  transmissions  and  other  engine  improvements 
with no impact on vehicle safety. Further fuel economy gains can be made with ad-
ditional technology that can improve both safety and fuel economy. This can be done 
through reducing the weight of light trucks using materials like high strength steel 
and  aluminum  and  unibody  construction—this  means  that  SUVs  can  be  just  as 
large  as  they  are  today,  but  will  be  safer  for  the  driver.  Because  light  trucks  pose 
a substantial risk to other vehicles on the road due to their mass and design, mak-
ing them lighter will also save the lives of others on the road. 
Great Potential for Pickup Trucks 

Pickup trucks represent one-third of the light truck market and must be improved 
if we are to truly address the global warming and energy security problems of boom-
ing  sales  of  low  fuel  economy  vehicles  and  if  consumers  are  to  reap  the  fuel  saving 
benefits of efficiency technology. Questions have been raised about the potential for 
these vehicles to meet higher fuel economy levels. While it is true that pickup trucks 
do have a greater technical hurdle given the payload and towing capacities that are 
required for some applications, the broad range of technologies that exist to improve 
other  light  trucks  can  also  increase  pickup  truck  fuel  economy  significantly.  In  the 
end, pickup trucks may not be able to reach the same fuel economy levels as SUVs 
or  minivans,  but  the  significant  improvements  that  are  possible  will  help  pickup 
owners  save  money,  helping,  not  harming  businesses,  farmers,  rural  residents  and 
others who purchase these vehicles.

Fuel  Efficient  Pickups.  Farmers,  rural  residents  and  businesses  can  be  confident 
that  using  existing  and  emerging  technologies,  pickup  truck  fuel  economy  could 
reach at least 26 mpg using on the road technology and more than 33 mpg over the 
next  10  years.  These  levels  of  fuel  economy  improvements  can  save  pickup  drivers 
$4,300 to nearly $7,400 at the gasoline pump, three to six times the cost of the fuel 
economy improvements. 

Efficiency  with  Power.  High-efficiency  engines  do  not  have  to  be  low-power  en-
gines; pickups and other light trucks that achieve over 30 mpg can perform at least 
as well as those on the road today. One key to maintaining towing performance and 
acceleration  is  the  use  of  variable  valve  engines  that  are  both  more  efficient  and 
more  powerful  than  most  engines  in  trucks  today.  Also,  using  cylinder  shut-off 
means  you  can  have  a  powerful  8-cylinder  engine  when  you  need  high  torque  and 
power,  and  an  efficient  4-cylinder  engine  when  half  of  the  cylinders  are  shut  off  at 
low  power  to  save  fuel.  Automakers  have  traditionally  met  fuel  economy  standards 
without sacrificing power. In fact, pickup truck horsepower has increased more than 
50  percent  over  the  past  decade  while  fuel  economy  has  remained  relatively  con-
stant. 

Class-based  Standards.  In  March  2006,  the  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Ad-
ministration (NHTSA) finalized a set of structural changes to the light truck CAFE 
program.  Chief  among  the  structural  changes  was  the  introduction  of  size-based 
standards,  which  permit  manufacturers  who  produce  more  large  trucks  to  meet  a 
lower  standard  than  manufacturers  focusing  on  smaller  trucks.  This  change  ad-
dresses  longstanding  industry  concerns  that  increasing  truck  CAFE  would  force 
them  to  stop  making  large  pickups.  Technological  improvements  can  increase  fuel 
economy  across  the  board,  allowing  automakers  to  continue  selling  a  broad  array 
of vehicles to meet consumer needs while meeting higher standards overall. 

Union of Concerned Scientists—Fact Sheet—May 2006 

NATIONAL ACADEMIES NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL REPORT ON: EFFECTIVENESS 

AND IMPACT OF CORPORATE AVERAGE FUEL ECONOMY (CAFE) STANDARDS 

‘‘Because  of  concerns  about  greenhouse  gases  and  the  level  of  oil  imports,  it  is 
appropriate  for  the  Federal  Government  to  ensure  fuel  economy  levels  beyond 
those expected to result from market forces alone.’’ [p. 5] 

In January 2002, the National Research Council (NRC) released their final report 
on  Corporate  Average  Fuel  Economy  (CAFE)  Standards.  The  report  was  requested 
by  Congress  and  produced  by  a  National  Academy  of  Sciences  (NAS)  committee. 
UCS  analysis  of  the  results  from  that  study  indicate  that  it  is  both  technically  fea-
sible  and  cost  effective  to  raise  the  average  fuel  economy  of  new  passenger  cars  and 
light  trucks  from  today’s  level  of  24  mpg  to  37  mpg  within  10  to  15  years,  even  if 
gas drops back to $2.50 a gallon. 
Technical Potential 

‘‘Portney,  chair  of  the  National  Research  Council’s  Committee  on  Effectiveness 
and  Impact  of  CAFE  Standards,  noted  that,  upon  reflection,  the  Committee’s 
2001  report  may  have  been  too  conservative  in  its  fuel  economy  recommenda-
tions  . . .  ‘It  might  be  possible  to  meet  more  stringent  fuel  economy  standards 
at  lower  costs  than  the  Committee  foresaw  in  2001.’ ’’  February  9,  2005  press 
release  from  Resources  For  the  Future  regarding  the  former  RFF  President’s 
statement before the House Science Committee. 

The report explored three paths to increase fuel economy, two focused on existing 
technologies that could be used within 10 years, and one focused on emerging tech-
nologies that could be used in 10 to 15 years. For each path, NAS estimated poten-
tial  increases  for  each  of  ten  major  car  classes  (e.g.,  subcompacts,  large  SUVs). 
Based on Model Year 2000 market shares and NAS estimates for the 10 year poten-
tial, a fleet fuel economy of 33 mpg is possible within the decade of the report publi-
cation  (2002).  Using  the  emerging  technologies  added  in  Path  3,  the  fleet  could 
reach 37 mpg in the 2012 to 2017 timeframe.

In  the  four  years  since  the  report  was  published,  many  of  the  emerging  tech-
nologies have become available. Further, as recently noted by the panel’s Chair, the 
report  did  not  anticipate  the  progress  that  has  happened  with  hybrids  and  cleaner 
diesel.  The  report  also  did  not  account  for  growing  oil  demand  from  the  developed 
world, the full impact of 9/11, or Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. 

Even with the limits on the panel’s work, the results are in close agreement with 
UCS analysis of fuel economy potential. While the panel either increased the weight 
of  the  vehicles  or  left  it  the  same,  UCS  included  the  potential  for  even  more  im-
provements using high-strength, advanced materials to safely reduce vehicle weight. 
Cost Effectiveness 

In evaluating costs, the NAS report undertook what they called a ‘‘cost efficiency’’ 
analysis.  This  analysis  identifies  the  fuel  economy  level  where  consumers  save  the 
most money, assuming a gasoline price of $1.50 per gallon. However, as analysis of 
the  report  shows,  the  higher  the  fuel  economy  the  better  when  gasoline  is  at  $2.50 
per gallon. 

UCS’s  analysis  of  the  NAS  cost  and  fuel  economy  projections  show  that  the  tech-
nologies  available  for  a  37  mpg  fleet  would  yield  very  positive  consumer  benefits, 
saving drivers $2,500 more at the pump than the cost of the fuel economy improve-

ments.  Even  in  this  case  the  NAS  did  not  consider  the  use  of  hybrid  technology, 
cleaner  advanced  diesel  engines,  or  advanced  high-strength  materials,  which  would 
have  made  the  potential  fuel  economy,  and  the  savings  to  consumers,  even  higher. 
Safety Impacts 

‘‘Thus, it is technically feasible and potentially economical to improve fuel econ-
omy  without  reducing  vehicle  weight  or  size,  and,  therefore,  without  signifi-
cantly affecting the safety of motor vehicle travel.’’ [p. 70] 

The  NAS  committee  could  not  come  to  agreement  on  the  question  of  safety  and 
fuel  economy.  Some  panel  members  dissented  from  the  conclusion  that  past  fuel 
economy  improvements  have  had  a  negative  impact  on  safety.  They  cite  several 
problems  with  the  majority  analysis.  The  majority  findings  are  further  predicated 
on  the  assertion  that  past  data  can  be  used  to  evaluate  current  and  future  safety 
implications. However, it is clear that the cars and trucks of today are not the same 
as  those  from  10–20  years  ago—and  those  differences  drastically  influence  the  na-
ture of accidents today. Since the release of the panel’s report, several studies have 
shown  that  increasing  weight  is  bad  for  highway  safety.  These  studies  cast  further 
doubt on the theory of fuel economy having negative safety impacts. 

UCS and the Center for Auto Safety, in both Building a Better SUV and Drilling 
in Detroit, demonstrate that fuel economy can be improved while actually improving 
safety. First, both the NAS and the American Council for an Energy Efficient Econ-
omy conclude that large fuel economy gains are achievable simply through technical 
modifications that do not affect vehicle safety in any way. Second, if there is serious 
concern  about  the  fact  that  over  40,000  people  die  on  U.S.  highways  every  year, 
then  a  significant  focus  should  be  placed  on  the  most  important  factor,  vehicle  de-
sign—safety  standards  should  be  tightened  to  require  better  technology  to  avoid 
crashes and better protect occupants when crashes do happen. Third, even if weight 
were  to  be  taken  out  of  vehicles,  high-strength  materials  that  have  superior  crash 
safety performance can be used and vehicle size, a more important safety factor, can 
be  maintained.  Finally,  reducing  the  weight  disparity  between  heavy  vehicles  and 
light vehicles can actually improve safety of the overall fleet. 
Regulatory Loopholes 

Light  Truck  Loophole.  The  NAS  committee  found  that  the  distinction  between 
cars and light trucks ‘‘has been stretched well beyond its original purpose.’’ [p. ES– 
4] and will lead to further erosions in fuel economy as new trucks replace older vehi-
cles that had higher fuel economy. Recently enacted rules from NHTSA claim to ad-
dress this, but since they only apply to light-trucks the rules will not close the loop-
hole. 

Dual-Fuel Loophole. NAS also found that oil dependence is being increased by the 
CAFE provision allowing dual-fuel vehicles (vehicles that can run on gasoline or an 
alternative  fuel)  to  garner  extra  CAFE  credits  and  calls  for  the  elimination  of  the 
credits.  Less  than  1  percent  of  these  dual-fuel  vehicles  ever  use  alternative  fuels. 
Instead  of  closing  the  loophole,  it  was  extended  in  the  final  version  of  H.R.  6,  the 
recently enacted energy bill. 

Union of Concerned Scientists—Fact Sheet—July 2006 

MODERN FUEL ECONOMY AND VEHICLE SAFETY RESEARCH 

Consumers  and  lawmakers  can  be  confident  that  increased  fuel  economy  stand-
ards  and  vehicle  safety  are  compatible.  While  the  specter  of  a  deadly  vehicle  fleet 
is  often  raised  by  critics  of  improved  fuel  economy  standards,  it  is  just  an  attempt 
to scare away support from a path that will save consumers billions, improve Amer-
ica’s  energy  security,  reduce  global  warming  pollution,  and  increase  consumer 
choice. 

The  myth  that  fuel  economy  and  safety  are  not  compatible  has  been  discredited 
by several recent studies. These works are summarized below and demonstrate that: 
• Increased  fuel  economy  can  be  achieved  with  technologies  that  have  nothing  to 

do with the safety performance of a car or truck, 

• Historically,  higher  fuel  economy  has  not  been  linked  with  increased  fatalities, 
• Large vehicles do not have inherently lower fatality rates than smaller vehicles, 
• Increased weight is actually associated with increased fatalities.

National  Academy  of  Sciences,  2002—Effectiveness  and  Impact  of  CAFE  Standards 
This  report,  requested  by  Congress,  concluded  that  there  is  technology  already 
available  that  could  raise  the  fuel  economy  of  our  vehicle  fleet  without  compro-
mising  its  safety.  Most  of  technologies  considered  by  the  NAS  relate  to  engines, 
transmissions, and other improvements that have no connection to crash safety. Op-
ponents of fuel economy improvements often point to the chapter of the NAS report 
which  took  a  retrospective  look  at  safety,  and  gloss  over  the  fact  that  this  chapter 
did  not  represent  a  consensus  of  the  Committee  or  modern  safety  research  (appen-
dices  included  a  dissenting  opinion  pointing  out  problems  with  the  majority’s  anal-
ysis). 
S.  Ahmad  and  D.  Greene,  2004—The  Effect  of  Fuel  Economy  on  Automobile  Safety: 

A Reexamination 

Greene (one of the dissenting NAS panelists) and Ahmad demonstrated that high-
er  fuel  economy  is  not  linked  with  increased  fatalities.  In  fact,  their  report  noted 
that  ‘‘higher  mpg  is  significantly  correlated  with  fewer  fatalities.’’  A  thorough  anal-
ysis  of  data  from  1966  to  2002  indicated  if  the  past  is  precept,  fuel  economy  could 
likely be increased without harming safety. 
M.  Ross  and  T.  Wenzel,  2002—An  Analysis  of  Traffic  Deaths  by  Vehicle  Type  and 

Model 

This analysis of Federal accident data from 1995–1999 demonstrated that quality 
of engineering, rather than weight, is the key determinant of vehicle safety. In other 
words,  a  well-designed  compact  car  can  be  safer  than  an  SUV  or  a  pickup.  The 
study pointed specifically to the Honda Civic and the Volkswagen Jetta as well-engi-
neered  compact  cars  that  have  lower  driver  fatality  rates  than  the  Ford  Explorer, 
the Dodge Ram, or the Toyota 4Runner. 
R.M.  Van  Auken  and  J.W.  Zellner—A  Further  Assessment  of  the  Effects  of  Vehicle 
Weight and Size Parameters on Fatality Risk In Model Year 1985–98 Passenger 
Cars and 1985–97 Light Trucks 

This study indicated that while increasing vehicle size tends to decrease fatalities, 
increasing  vehicle  weight  increases  fatalities.  This  study  helped  inform  NHTSA  as 
it chose to base its model year 2008–2011 light truck rule on a size attribute rather 
than a weight attribute.

STATEMENT OF ELIZABETH A. LOWERY, VICE PRESIDENT, 

ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY, GENERAL MOTORS 

Ms.  LOWERY.  Good  afternoon,  Mr.  Chairman.  My  name  is  Eliza-
beth  Lowery,  and  I’m  Vice  President  for  Environment  and  Energy 
at General Motors. I’m pleased to be able to speak to you today re-
garding  GM’s  plans  for  advanced  technologies  that  reduce  depend-
ence on petroleum and provide energy diversity. In addition, I will 
comment on the effectiveness of the CAFE program. 

Today’s  automotive  industry  provides  more  in  the  way  of  oppor-
tunities  and  challenges  than  we’ve  seen  in  its  entire  history.  On 
the  challenge  side,  there  are  serious  concerns  about  energy  supply 
and availability that collectively we refer to as energy security. The 
key  is  energy  diversity,  which  can  help  us  displace  substantial 
quantities of oil that are consumed by U.S. vehicles. This is a huge 
assignment,  but  it’s  also  an  extraordinary  opportunity.  By  devel-
oping  alternative  sources  of  energy  and  propulsion,  we  have  the 
chance  to  mitigate  the  many  issues  surrounding  energy  avail-
ability.  This  means  we  must  continue  to  improve  the  efficiency  of 
today’s  vehicles.  But  it  also  means  we  need  to  dramatically  inten-
sify  our  efforts  to  displace  petroleum-based  fuels  by  building  more 
vehicles  that  run  on  alternative  fuels  and  by  significantly  expand-
ing  and  accelerating  our  commitment  to  the  development  of  elec-
trically driven vehicles.

First,  let  me  speak  about  biofuels.  Last  year,  we  committed  to 
double  our  production  of  vehicles  capable  of  running  on  renewable 
fuels  by  2010,  and,  further,  to  make  fully  half  of  our  annual  pro-
duction  biofuel-capable  by  2012,  provided  there  is  ample  avail-
ability and distribution of E85. But, as you know, flex-fuel vehicles 
alone  will  not  get  the  job  done.  So,  we’re  partnering  with  govern-
ment,  fuel  providers,  and  fuel  retailers  to  help  grow  the  E85  eth-
anol  infrastructure.  Since  May  of  2005,  we’ve  helped  add  200  E85 
fueling stations in 13 states. 

But  there’s  equally  exciting  opportunity  for  the  future  of  our 
products,  electrification  of  the  automobile.  There’s  a  continuum  of 
electrification  of  vehicles,  and  we’re  working  on  the  entire  range. 
For example, there are what most people think of as ‘‘electric vehi-
cles,’’ pure battery-powered vehicles. Then there are gas-electric hy-
brids,  which  are  not,  per  se,  electric  vehicles,  but  which  are,  in 
part, electrically driven. 

For  2007,  GM  currently  has  available—the  Saturn  VUE  Green 
Line  and  we  will  be  introducing  four  additional  hybrids  later  this 
year,  the  Saturn  Aura  Green  Line,  the  Chevy  Malibu  hybrid,  and 
the Chevy Tahoe and GMC Yukon, with GM’s two-mode hybrid sys-
tem.  Another  variant  of  the  hybrid  is  the  so-called  plug-in  hybrid, 
which  will  be  a  conventional  hybrid  vehicle  with  a  much  more  ad-
vanced  battery  capability,  significantly  more  energy  reduced,  and, 
of course, be able to plug it in to your standard 110-volt outlet. The 
result will be significantly better fuel economy, based on the petro-
leum  consumption  of  the  vehicle  and  the  ability  to  use  diverse  en-
ergy  sources.  Given  what  we  know  today,  it’s  pretty  clear  that  it 
will  take  several  years  to  see  if  the  battery  technology  will  let  us 
bring to market such a plug-in hybrid, because it must meet all the 
requirements that are necessary in the marketplace. 

In  the  meantime,  we  are  working  on  engineering  two  different 
systems for plug-in hybrids. One takes the form of our Saturn VUE 
hybrid  and  the  other  unveiled  is  the  Chevy  Volt  at  the  auto  show 
in  Detroit  that  we  heard  from  Senator  Carper.  There  are  other 
types of electrically driven vehicles that we expect to see in the fu-
ture, as well, including hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles. 

So,  the  technology  front  in  automotive  development  and  design 
looks  very  exciting.  And  as  we  pursue  these  technologies,  and  we 
think  that  Government  also  has  a  role  to  play.  First,  the  Govern-
ment should fund a major effort to increase advanced battery R&D 
and  to  develop  domestic  production  of  these  batteries  here  in  the 
United  States.  Second,  biofuels  production  and  infrastructure 
should  be  significantly  expanded.  Third,  Government  funding 
should  expand  development  and  demonstration  of  hydrogen  and 
fuel  cells.  Fourth,  Government  purchasing  should  set  the  example. 
And,  finally,  there  should  be  further  incentives  for  advanced  auto-
motive  technologies  so  they  can  be  adopted  by  consumers  in  very 
large numbers. 

Having  focused  on  advanced  technology  vehicles  and  renewable 
fuels as the answer to displacing and diversifying U.S. fuel sources, 
let me share our view on what we don’t think is the answer. 

Over-reliance on CAFE is not the answer to U.S. oil dependence. 
Now, don’t misunderstand what I’m saying here. We agree with the 
need  to  reduce  Americans’  dependence  on  petroleum,  and  we  are 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  08:33 Apr 16, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00072 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\80088.TXT JACKIE

committed to doing our part. But, despite dramatic increases in ve-
hicle  and  fuel  economy  over  the  last  30  years,  its  original  goals— 
reducing U.S. oil consumption and oil imports—have not been met. 
Of  the  four  factors  that  drive  U.S.  light-duty  gasoline  consump-
tion—one,  purchasing  decisions  of  American  consumers,  the  sales 
mix;  two,  total  vehicle  miles  traveled;  three,  the  size  of  the  overall 
fleet; and, finally, four, individual fuel economy—CAFE only affects 
one  factor.  Data  from  the  Government’s  own  Energy  Information 
Administration  shows  that  CAFE  requirements  alone  cannot  over-
come  the  increases  in  petroleum  demand  which  are  driven  largely 
by the continued increase in vehicle miles traveled and the increas-
ing size of the fleet. 

We  understand,  of  course,  that  increasing  vehicle  fuel  economy 
does  play  an  important  role.  As  competitive  automakers  looking  to 
win consumer purchase of vehicles in the marketplace, we look for 
opportunities  to  increase  the  fuel  economy  of  our  new  products 
each  time  they  are  introduced.  But  many  of  the  recent  legislative 
proposals to increase CAFE requirements are not based on any re-
alistic  measure  of  what  is  technically  achievable  and  economically 
practical. 

Rather  than  having  Congress  try  to  pick  an  arbitrary  rate  of  in-
crease  for  CAFE  standards,  we  believe  that  the  regulatory  process 
of the Department of Transportation should be used. That way, the 
agency can collect and review confidential and proprietary company 
product  plans  and  can  consider  the  opportunities  to  increase  the 
fuel economies level—fuel economy levels consistent with consumer 
demands,  choices,  competitive  implications,  vehicle  and  highway 
safety,  and  the  impact  on  U.S.  jobs.  This  administration  has  twice 
undertaken such rulemakings for light truck CAFE levels and now 
has  set  in  place  increases  for  7  consecutive  years.  These  chal-
lenging increases in the CAFE requirements allow the automakers 
to  make  the  progress  they  can  with  conventional  technologies  and 
still focus increasingly on the advanced technology systems in vehi-
cles  that  can  really  make  a  difference  in  addressing  U.S.  gasoline 
consumption. 

In  addition,  before  any  increases  are  undertaken  for  the  pas-
senger car fleet, the agency should be given the authority to estab-
lish a reformed or attribute-based system similar to what was done 
for the light truck CAFE system. This will help reduce the competi-
tive disparities, as well as avoid other consequences of raising fuel 
economy  levels,  like  vehicle  mass  and  size  reductions  that  can  ad-
versely affect vehicle and highway safety. 

In summary, we believe tomorrow’s automobiles must be flexible 
enough to accommodate many different energy sources. We need to 
all work together on a national energy strategy that helps promote 
these  changes  and,  thus,  more  effectively  address  U.S.  dependence 
on petroleum. 

Thank  you  very  much,  and  I’d  be  pleased  to  answer  any  ques-

tions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ELIZABETH A. LOWERY, VICE PRESIDENT, ENVIRONMENT 

AND ENERGY, GENERAL MOTORS 

70 

Good  morning.  My  name  is  Elizabeth  Lowery  and  I  am  Vice  President  for  Envi-
ronment  and  Energy  at  General  Motors.  I  am  pleased  to  be  able  to  speak  to  you 
today regarding GM’s technology plans for the future. 

Today’s automotive industry provides more in the way of opportunities—and chal-
lenges—than  we  have  seen  in  its  entire  history.  On  the  challenge  side,  there  are 
serious  concerns  about  energy  supply,  energy  availability,  sustainable  growth,  the 
environment,  and  even  national  security  issues  that,  collectively,  have  come  to  be 
called ‘‘energy security.’’ And the fact of the matter is that it is highly unlikely that 
oil alone is going to supply all of the world’s rapidly growing automotive energy re-
quirements.  For  the  global  auto  industry,  this  means  that  we  must—as  a  business 
necessity—develop alternative sources of propulsion, based on alternative sources of 
energy  in  order  to  meet  the  world’s  growing  demand  for  our  products.  The  key  is 
energy  diversity,  which  can  help  us  displace  substantial  quantities  of  oil  that  are 
consumed by U.S. vehicles today. 

This  is  a  huge  assignment.  But  it’s  also  an  extraordinary  opportunity.  By  devel-
oping  alternative  sources  of  energy  and  propulsion,  we  have  the  chance  to  mitigate 
many  of  the  issues  surrounding  energy  availability.  We  will  be  able  to  better  cope 
with  future  increases  in  global  energy  demand.  We  will  minimize  the  automobile’s 
impact on the environment. 

This  means  that  we  must  continue  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  internal  com-
bustion engine, as we have for decades. But, it also means we need to dramatically 
intensify our efforts to displace petroleum-based fuels by building more vehicles that 
run on alternatives, such as E85 ethanol, and, very importantly, by significantly ex-
panding  and  accelerating  our  commitment  to  the  development  of  electrically  driven 
vehicles. 

First let me speak about bio-fuels. One of the greatest opportunities for displacing 
U.S. gasoline is to ramp up the usage of bio-fuels. There are already over 6 million 
E85 capable vehicles on America’s roads. If all flex-fueled vehicles on the road today 
ran on E85, we would displace the need for over 3.8 billion gallons of gasoline annu-
ally. 

Last  year,  we  committed  to  double  our  production  of  vehicles  capable  of  running 
on  renewable  fuels  by  2010.  That’s  almost  one  million  E85  capable  vehicles  a  year 
by the end of the decade Late last year, we also said that we are prepared to make 
fully  half  of  our  annual  vehicle  production  biofuel-capable  by  2012—provided  there 
is  ample  availability  and  distribution  of  E85,  as  part  of  an  overall  national  energy 
strategy.  If  all  of  these  flex-fueled  vehicles  ran  on  E85,  by  2017  we  would  displace 
the  need  for  over  22  billion  gallons  of  gasoline  annually.  As  a  nation,  we  need  to 
be developing the necessary sources of these bio-fuels to make sure we can produce 
the volumes that can have this dramatic an impact. 

But  as  you  know,  flex-fuel  vehicles  alone  will  not  get  the  job  done.  Right  now, 
there  are  about  170,000  gas  stations  in  the  United  States,  but  only  slightly  more 
than 1,100 E85 pumps. So, we are also partnering with government, fuel providers, 
and fuel retailers across the U.S. to help grow the E85 ethanol fueling station infra-
structure. Since May of 2005, we’ve helped add 200 E85 fueling stations in 13 states 
with more to come. 

Now  let  me  turn  to  potentially  the  even  more  exciting  opportunity  for  the  future 
of our products—electrification of the automobile. Over the last few months, GM has 
made several announcements related to our commitment to electrically driven vehi-
cles. The benefits of electricity include the opportunity to diversify fuel sources ‘‘up-
stream’’ of the vehicle. In other words, the electricity that is used to drive the vehi-
cle  can  be  made  from  the  best  local  fuel  sources—natural  gas,  coal,  nuclear,  wind, 
hydroelectric,  and  so  on.  So,  before  you  even  start  your  vehicle,  you’re  working  to-
ward energy diversity. Second, electrically driven vehicles—when operated in an all- 
electric  mode—are  zero-emission  vehicles.  And  when  the  electricity  itself  is  made 
from  a  renewable  source,  the  entire  energy  pathway  is  effectively  greenhouse  gas 
emissions  free.  Third,  electrically  driven  vehicles  offer  great  performance—with  ex-
traordinary acceleration, instant torque, and improved driving dynamics. 

There is a continuum of electrification of vehicles—and we are working along that 
entire  range.  For  example,  there  are  what  most  people  think  of  as  ‘‘electric  vehi-
cles’’—pure  battery-powered  vehicles,  such  as  GM’s  EV1.  The  EV1  ran  solely  on 
electricity that was generated outside the vehicle and was stored onboard the vehi-
cle, in lead-acid and nickel-metal-hydride batteries. 

Then  there  are  gas-electric  hybrids—which  are  not,  per  se,  electric  vehicles—but 
which  are,  in  part,  electrically  driven.  This  type  of  conventional  hybrid  vehicle  has 
both  an  internal  combustion  engine  and  an  electric  drive.  And,  it  can  be  powered

by both systems simultaneously or by either system independently. The electric en-
ergy  in  a  conventional  hybrid  vehicle  is  generated  by  the  vehicle  itself  and  stored 
onboard in a battery. 

We  have  several  kinds  of  hybrid  vehicles,  either  on  the  road  or  under  develop-
ment—from  the  heavy  duty  hybrid  that  is  used  in  more  than  550  transit  buses— 
to  the  Saturn  VUE  and  Aura  Green  Line  models  (which  use  our  high-value  ‘‘belt 
alternator  starter’’  system)—to  our  advanced  ‘‘two-mode’’  hybrid  system  (which  will 
begin to show up on our full-size SUVs and pickups later this year). 

At the Los Angeles auto show, we announced work on another type of hybrid, the 
Saturn VUE ‘‘plug-in hybrid.’’ A plug-in hybrid will be a conventional hybrid vehicle 
with an important difference—the battery will be much more advanced—storing sig-
nificantly more energy and, of course, being able to be plugged into a standard out-
let  to  recharge  it.  The  result  will  be  significantly  better  ‘‘fuel  economy’’—based  on 
the  petroleum  consumption  of  the  vehicle—and  the  ability  to  use  diverse  energy 
sources. 

No major OEM has built a plug-in hybrid for retail sale because the required bat-
tery technology doesn’t yet exist. In fact, given what we know today, it’s pretty clear 
that  it  will  take  several  years  to  see  if  the  battery  technology  will  occur  that  will 
let  us  bring  to  market  a  plug-in  hybrid  that  will  meet  the  expectations  and  real- 
world  performance  standards  that  our  customers  expect—things  like  safety,  reli-
ability, durability, driving range, recharge time, and affordability. 

The  Saturn  VUE  plug-in  hybrid  will  use  an  advanced  battery,  like  lithium-ion. 
Production timing will depend on battery technology development. But, based on our 
work  with  EV1  and  our  different  conventional  hybrid-electric  vehicles,  we  already 
have a lot of experience developing and integrating advanced battery technology into 
our  vehicles,  and  we’re  already  working  today  with  a  number  of  battery  companies 
to develop the technology necessary to build a plug-in hybrid. The technological hur-
dles  are  real,  but  we  believe  they’re  also  surmountable.  I  can’t  give  you  a  date  cer-
tain  for  our  plug-in  hybrid,  but  I  can  tell  you  that  this  is  a  top  priority  program 
for GM, given the huge potential it offers for oil consumption improvements. 

Earlier this year, we unveiled the Concept Chevrolet Volt at the North American 
International  Auto  Show  in  Detroit.  The  Chevrolet  Volt  is  designed  to  be  powered 
by  GM’s  next-generation  electric  propulsion  system,  the  E-flex  System.  The  E-flex 
System can be configured to produce electricity for mechanical propulsion from gaso-
line, ethanol, biodiesel or hydrogen. The Volt uses a large high energy battery pack 
and a small, one liter turbo gasoline engine to produce electricity. 

The  Concept  Chevrolet  Volt  can  be  charged  by  plugging  it  into  a  110-volt  outlet 
for  approximately  6  hours  each  day.  When  the  advanced  lithium-ion  battery  pack 
is fully charged, the Volt is expected to deliver 40 city miles of pure electric vehicle 
range. When the battery pack is close to depletion, the small engine spins at a con-
stant speed to create electricity and replenish the battery pack. 

One  technological  breakthrough  required  to  make  this  concept  a  reality  is  the 
large lithium-ion battery pack. This type of electric car, which the technical commu-
nity calls an ‘‘EV range-extender,’’ would require a battery pack that weighs nearly 
400 pounds. 

There  are  other  types  of  electrically  driven  vehicles  that  we  expect  to  see  in  the 
future  as  well,  including  hydrogen  fuel  cell  vehicles,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Sequel 
concept vehicle. A hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is, in fact, an electric vehicle. It drives 
on electricity that is created by the fuel cell. The fuel cell is little more than a bat-
tery that stores electricity in the form of hydrogen. The beauty of a fuel cell vehicle 
like the Sequel is that the electricity is generated onboard the vehicle without using 
petroleum-based  fuel,  and  without  emissions.  And  like  electricity,  hydrogen  can  be 
made from diverse energy sources before it ever powers a vehicle. As part of a com-
prehensive  deployment  plan  dubbed  Project  Driveway,  we  are  building  more  than 
100  next-generation  Chevrolet  Equinox  Fuel  Cell  vehicles  that  will  operate  and  re-
fuel with hydrogen in California, New York, and Washington, D.C. 

GM is developing a prototype fuel cell variant of the Chevy Volt that mirrors the 
propulsion system in the Chevrolet Sequel (fuel cell vehicle). Instead of a big battery 
pack  and  a  small  engine  generator  used  in  the  Volt  concept  vehicle,  we  would  use 
a fuel cell propulsion system with a small battery to capture energy when the vehi-
cle brakes. Because the Volt is so small and lightweight, we would need only about 
half  of  the  hydrogen  storage  as  the  Sequel  to  get  300  miles  of  range.  In  fact,  we 
continue to make significant progress in this area, and we continue to see fuel cells 
as the best long-term solution for reducing our dependence on oil. 

Since  I  have  mentioned  that  advanced  technology  vehicles  that  can  promote  the 
development of biofuels and electrification are ‘‘the answer’’ to displacing and diver-
sifying  U.S.  fuel  sources—let  me  share  our  view  on  what  is  not  the  answer.  Over 
reliance  on  CAFE  is  not  the  answer  to  U.S.  oil  dependence.  Now  don’t  misunder-

stand  what  I  am  saying  here.  We  agree  with  the  need  to  reduce  the  Nation’s  de-
pendence  on  petroleum.  And  the  objectives  for  the  original  CAFE  program  were  to: 
(1) reduce U.S. gasoline consumption and (2) reduce U.S. imports of petroleum. But 
despite dramatic increases in vehicle and fleet fuel economy over the 30 year exist-
ence of the CAFE program, U.S. gasoline consumption and oil imports have not de-
clined. 

Since the CAFE program was enacted, U.S. consumption of gasoline has increased 
by 60 percent and U.S. imports of petroleum have increased from 35 percent of our 
supplies to over 70 percent of our supplies. At the same time, new vehicle fleet fuel 
economy  has  more  than  doubled  for  passenger  cars  and  increased  60  percent  for 
light trucks. But these increases have been overwhelmed by the increases in the size 
of the vehicle fleet and the number of miles traveled by Americans annually. 

There  are  four  factors  that  drive  U.S.  light  duty  gasoline  consumption:  (1)  pur-
chasing decisions of American consumers—sales mix, (2) total vehicle miles traveled, 
(3)  size  of  the  overall  fleet,  and  finally  (4)  individual  vehicle  fuel  economy.  CAFE 
only affects one of these four factors—only vehicle fuel economy. Data from the gov-
ernment’s  own  Energy  Information  Administration  shows  that  CAFE  requirements 
alone cannot overcome our increases in petroleum demand—due to the continued in-
crease  in  vehicle  miles  traveled  and  the  increasing  size  of  the  fleet.  Even  so,  in-
creases in CAFE standards continue to be one of the major focuses of how to address 
energy security issues. 

We  understand,  of  course,  that  increasing  vehicle  fuel  economy  does  play  a  role 
in  helping  address  U.S.  gasoline  consumption.  As  competitive  automakers  looking 
to win consumer purchases of vehicles in the marketplace, we look for opportunities 
to increase the fuel economy of our new products each time they are introduced. But 
many  of  the  recent  legislative  proposals  to  increase  CAFE  requirements  (by  4  per-
cent  or  more)  are  not  based  on  any  realistic  measure  of  what  is  technically  achiev-
able and economically practicable. 

Rather  than  having  Congress  try  to  pick  an  arbitrary  rate  of  increase  for  CAFE 
standards,  we  believe  that  the  regulatory  process  at  the  Department  of  Transpor-
tation should be used. That way, the agency can collect and review confidential and 
proprietary  company  product  plans  and  consider  the  opportunities  to  increase  the 
fuel  economy  levels  consistent  with  consumer  needs  and  choices,  competitive  impli-
cations,  vehicle  and  highway  safety,  and  the  impact  on  U.S.  jobs.  This  Administra-
tion  has  twice  undertaken  such  rulemakings  for  the  light  truck  CAFE  levels.  The 
most  recent  fuel  economy  rule  for  light  trucks  has  now  set  in  place  increases  for 
7  consecutive  years  (2005–2011)—increasing  the  standards  by  16  percent  (about  2 
percent  per  year)  and  for  the  first  time  adding  to  the  regulated  fleet  the  largest 
SUV’s  in  the  market.  These  challenging  increases  in  the  CAFE  requirements  allow 
the  automakers  to  make  the  progress  that  they  can  with  conventional  technology 
vehicles,  and  still  focus  increasingly  on  the  advanced  technology  systems  and  vehi-
cles that can really make a difference in addressing U.S. gasoline consumption. 

In  addition,  before  any  increases  are  undertaken  for  the  passenger  car  fleet,  the 
agency should be given authority to establish a reformed, or attribute-based system, 
similar  to  what  was  done  for  the  light  truck  CAFE  system.  This  will  help  reduce 
the competitive disparities as well as avoid other consequences of raising fuel econ-
omy  levels—like  vehicle  mass  and  size  reductions  that  can  adversely  affect  vehicle 
and highway safety. 

Technology, biofuels and energy diversity are the best answers to oil security con-
cerns. And, as we pursue these technologies—and more energy diversity—there are 
steps the government can take to help. 
• First,  the  government  should  fund  a  major  effort  to  strengthen  domestic  ad-
vanced battery capabilities. Advanced lithium-ion batteries are a key enabler to 
a  number  of  advanced  vehicle  technologies—including  plug-in  hybrids.  Govern-
ment  funding  should  increase  R&D  in  this  area  and  develop  new  support  for 
domestic manufacturing of advanced batteries. 
• Second,  biofuels  production  and  infrastructure  should  be  significantly  expanded. 
The  market  response  to  renewable  fuels  is  encouraging,  but  it  needs  to  reach 
a  self  sustaining  level  that  is  not  lessened  when  gasoline  prices  fall.  Steps  to 
increase  the  availability  of  biofuels  should  help  increase  its  use.  Government 
should continue incentives for: the manufacture of biofuel-capable flex fuel vehi-
cles;  increases  in  biofuels  production;  increases  for  R&D  into  cellulosic  ethanol; 
and increased support for broad-based infrastructure conversion. 
• Third,  government  funding  should  continue  and  expand  development  and  dem-
onstration of hydrogen and fuel cells. Tremendous progress has been made this 
decade on fulfilling the promise of hydrogen powered fuel cells. The U.S. needs 
to  stay  the  course  on  the  President’s  hydrogen  program  and  begin  to  prepare

73 

for  the  2010–2015  transition  to  market  phase.  Funding  should  continue  for  hy-
drogen and fuel cell R&D and demonstration activities at DOE. The government 
should  also  commit  to  early  purchases  by  government  fleets  and  support  for 
early refueling infrastructure in targeted locals in the 2010–2015 timeframe. 
• Fourth,  government  purchasing  should  set  the  example.  Government  fleets  can 
help  lead  the  way  to  bringing  new  automotive  technology  to  market  and  bring-
ing down the cost of new technologies. The government should continue to pur-
chase flex fuel vehicles; demand maximum utilization of E85 in the government 
flex  fuel  fleets;  use  Federal  fueling  to  stimulate  publicly  accessible  pumps;  pro-
vide  funding  to  permit  purchase  of  electric,  plug-in  and  fuel  cell  vehicles  into 
Federal fleets as soon as technology is available. 
• Finally,  there  should  be  further  incentives  for  advanced  automotive  technology 
so  that  these  technologies  may  be  adopted  by  consumers  in  large  numbers  to 
help address national energy security. Well crafted tax incentives can accelerate 
adoption  of  new  technologies  and  strengthen  domestic  manufacturing.  Con-
sumer  tax  credits  should  be  focused  on  technologies  that  have  the  greatest  po-
tential to actually reduce petroleum consumption and provide support for manu-
facturers/suppliers to build/convert facilities that provide advanced technologies. 
In summary, we believe tomorrow’s automobiles must be flexible enough to accom-
modate many different energy sources. And a key part of that flexibility will be en-
abled  by  the  development  of  electrically  driven  cars  and  trucks.  From  conventional 
gasoline and diesel fuel—to biofuels that can displace them, like E85 and biodiesel— 
to  electricity—whether  it  is  stored  or  generated  on  the  vehicle,  with  an  internal 
combustion  engine  or  a  hydrogen  fuel  cell—we  see  a  logical  journey  from  stand- 
alone, largely mechanical automobiles to vehicles that run on electricity.

STATEMENT OF DAVID L. GREENE, CORPORATE FELLOW, 

ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DIVISION, 

OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY 

Dr.  GREENE.  Good  afternoon,  Mr.  Chairman  and  all  the  guests. 
Today,  our  transportation  system  faces  serious  energy  chal-
lenges,  reducing  our  dependence  on  oil,  reversing  the  trend  of  in-
creasing  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  developing  sustainable  en-
ergy sources for an increasingly mobile world. Fuel economy stand-
ards  alone  cannot  solve  these  problems,  but  increasing  fuel  econ-
omy  must  be  the  cornerstone  of  any  effective  policy  strategy. 
Today,  fuel  economy  improvements  driven  primarily  by  past  fuel 
economy  standards  save  American  motorists  more  than  50  billion 
gallons  of  gasoline  every  year.  In  my  opinion,  proven  cost-effective 
technologies  exist  to  increase  passenger  car  and  light  truck  fuel 
economy  by  one-third  to  one-half  over  the  next  10  to  12  years.  No 
reduction in vehicle power or size would be necessary, and, at cur-
rent  and  projected  gasoline  prices,  the  value  to  consumers  of  the 
fuel  saved  would  exceed  the  cost  of  the  necessary  fuel-saving  tech-
nologies. 

You are presently considering bills requiring higher fuel economy 
standards.  One  calls  for  an  increase  to  40  mpg  for  passenger  cars 
by  2017;  the  other,  an  increase  to  35  mpg  for  passenger  cars  and 
light  trucks  combined.  Both  targets  are  within  the  range  of  what 
can  be  achieved  cost-effectively.  But  solving  our  oil  dependence 
problem and reducing greenhouse gas emissions will require a sus-
tained commitment. I urge you to look beyond 2017 to a goal of in-
creasing  light-duty  vehicle  fuel  economy  by  75  to  100  percent  by 
2030. 

Effective  fuel  economy  standards  can  take  many  forms.  Japan 
and  China  have  mandatory  weight-based  standards.  The  EU  has

74 

voluntary  industrywide  carbon  emission  standards.  And  we  have 
the mandatory Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards. Critics 
of the CAFE system have raised many objections to it over the past 
30  years.  Two  criticisms  have  been  especially  potent  in  preventing 
progress.  One,  CAFE  is  unfair  to  domestic  manufacturers.  Two, 
CAFE  is  unsafe.  The  first  is  correct,  but  often  exaggerated.  The 
second is incorrect. 

I  have  addressed  the  fact  that  CAFE  has  not  affected  highway 
safety in other testimony and other publications, but, regardless of 
one’s  viewpoint  on  these  two  issues,  the  Reformed  CAFE  standard 
adopted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for 
light trucks nullifies both criticisms. It adjusts each manufacturer’s 
standard  according  to  the  size  mix  of  vehicles  it  produces.  It  re-
moves any incentive for downsizing that the unreformed CAFE sys-
tem  might  create.  At  the  same  time,  it  keeps  nearly  all  significant 
fuel  economy  technologies  in  play.  It  also  creates  the  opportunity 
to finally eliminate the distinction between cars and light trucks in 
a unified set of footprint-based standards. 

I congratulate the staff of NHTSA for this important innovation. 
However,  NHTSA  should  have  done  a  thorough  automotive  engi-
neering  analysis  of  the  potential  for  a  footprint-based  standard  to 
have unintended consequences. If you decide to proceed with a foot-
print-based  fuel  economy  standard,  I  urge  you  to  require  that  this 
study be done. 

In  1975,  Congress  set  ambitious  standards  for  passenger  cars 
and  left  the  establishment  of  standards  for  light  trucks  to  the 
NHTSA.  The  result  was  less  ambitious  standards  for  light  trucks. 
On the other hand, over the past few years NHTSA has raised the 
light  truck  standards  twice  by  modest,  but  meaningful,  amounts, 
and has instituted an important change in the reform of the stand-
ards.  Congress  has  not  raised  the  passenger  car  standard  in  more 
than 30 years. 

I  don’t  claim  to  know  who  will  do  the  best  job  in  the  future,  but 
I do have two observations. One, it seems more than likely that we 
will  be  struggling  with  the  problem  of  climate  change  for  decades. 
In  my  view,  this  argues  for  locating  the  authority  over  fuel  econ-
omy,  or,  alternatively,  greenhouse  gas  emissions  standards,  with 
the agency that has the greatest interest, and responsibility for, ad-
dressing  climate  change,  unless  the  Congress  opts  to  set  the  fuel 
economy  standards  itself.  And  here,  I  would  note,  with  some  sym-
pathy  toward  the  NHTSA  Administrator,  that  the  National  Acad-
emies Committee also had a very difficult time deciding on the val-
ues of things like greenhouse gas emissions reductions and the val-
ues of energy security. And I think we asked the Congress for their 
judgment on those matters. 

I  believe  there  is  an  effective  market-based  alternative  to  fuel 
economy standards, however, that is worth considering. That alter-
native  is  called  ‘‘feebates.’’  Feebates  give  a  rebate  to  purchasers  of 
low-fuel-consumption  vehicles  and  impose  a  fee  on  the  buyers  of 
high-fuel-consumption vehicles. Feebates create a continuing incen-
tive to adopt energy-efficient technologies and use them to increase 
fuel economy. 

Fuel  economy  is  the  cornerstone  of  a  meaningful  policy  strategy 
for  addressing  transportation’s  oil  dependence,  greenhouse  gas

emissions,  and  need  for  sustainable  energy.  But  higher  fuel  econ-
omy is not sufficient. It’s a necessary step. 

75 

To achieve oil independence, for example, we will need to address 
all  uses  of  petroleum  throughout  our  economy,  including  heavy 
trucks,  aircraft,  home  heating  with  distillate  fuel,  and  even  petro-
leum  use  in  industry.  And  we  will  need  to  continue  increasing  en-
ergy  efficiency  and  domestic  energy  production  after  2017,  as  well. 
The  good  news  is  that  oil  independence  does  not  mean  we  have  to 
stop  using  oil,  or  even  stop  importing  oil,  and  that  once  we  imple-
ment  effective  policies,  we  will  see  steady  improvement.  Achieving 
oil  independence,  mitigating  climate  change,  and  securing  sustain-
able  energy  for  transportation  are  problems  that  require  a  com-
prehensive and sustained strategy. 

I  thank  this  committee  for  its  efforts  to  meaningfully  address 
these  very  important  issues  and  for  this  opportunity  to  offer  my 
views for consideration. And I look forward to any questions. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID L. GREENE, CORPORATE FELLOW, ENGINEERING 

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DIVISION, OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY 

Good afternoon. Thank you for inviting me to discuss the Corporate Average Fuel 
Economy Program and its current and prospective effectiveness. The views I express 
today will be entirely my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory or the Department of Energy. 
Energy Challenges 

Our nation and our world face crucial energy challenges. Our nation’s oil depend-
ence  costs  our  economy  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars  each  year  and  undermines 
our  national  security  (Greene  and  Ahmad,  2005).  The  threat  to  the  global  environ-
ment from human induced climate change fed by increasing emissions of carbon di-
oxide  from  the  combustion  of  fossil  fuels  becomes  clearer  with  each  passing  day. 
With demand for mobility growing rapidly around the world, sustainable sources of 
energy for the world’s growing mobility demands must be found. There is no quick, 
easy  solution.  Strong,  comprehensive,  sustained  policies  are  required.  Significant 
technological  advances  are  also  essential.  The  fuel  economy  policies  we  address 
today  are  by  themselves  not  enough  to  solve  these  energy  challenges.  But  they  are 
the cornerstone of any sufficient strategy. 
We Can Do This 

Fuel economy standards have been successful in the past, not just in this country 
but  around  the  world.  They  can  take  many  forms.  The  EU  has  industry-wide  vol-
untary  standards.  Japan  and  China  have  mandatory  weight-based  standards.  The 
United  States  has  mandatory  Corporate  Average  Fuel  Economy  (CAFE)  standards. 
What all these standards have in common is that they have successfully raised the 
energy  efficiency  of  motor  vehicle  fleets  and  saved  enormous  amounts  of  energy 
without  significant  negative  side  effects.  Our  own  CAFE  standards  brought  about 
a  50  percent  increase  in  on-road  fuel  economy  over  a  period  of  20  years.  This  im-
provement saves American consumers more than 50 billion gallons of gasoline every 
year (Figure 1).

How High Should We Go? 

Fuel  economy  standards  should  be  set  at  a  level  consistent  with  the  urgency  of 
our  energy  problems,  at  or  an  appropriate  distance  beyond  what  can  be  achieved 
cost-effectively  with  proven  technologies  that  do  not  require  significant  changes  in 
the size and performance of light-duty vehicles. Timing is also an important consid-
eration.  Manufacturers  should  be  given  sufficient  lead  time  to  redesign  their  entire 
product  lines  (approximately  10  years).  In  this  way  the  full  impact  of  proven  fuel 
economy technologies can be realized and manufacturers can be given a clear, long- 
term goal around which to plan. 

The  National  Research  Council  (NRC)  Committee  on  the  Impacts  and  Effective-
ness  of  CAFE  Standards,  on  which  I  was  privileged  to  serve,  defined  the  ‘‘cost-effi-
cient’’ level of fuel economy as the level at which the marginal present value of fuel 
savings  to  the  consumer  of  the  next  increment  in  fuel  economy  exactly  equals  the 
marginal  cost  of  technology  added  to  the  vehicle  to  produce  those  savings  (NRC, 
2002). Further, the Committee’s definition allowed no change in the size, weight, or 
performance  of  vehicles  over  a  base  year  level.  In  my  opinion,  fuel  economy  stand-
ards  should  be  set  at  least  as  high  as  the  cost-efficient  level  but  not  a  great  deal 
higher.  Figure  2  illustrates  for  an  average  passenger  car  the  trade-off  between  in-
creased price as a result of adding fuel economy technologies and the present value 
of fuel savings, based on the National Academies’ panel’s assessment. The difference 
between the value of savings and increased price, the net value, is what an efficient 
market  would  maximize  (all  other  things  equal).  The  difference  between  the  lines 
graphed in Figure 2 and the NRC Committee’s cost effective analysis is that a high-
er  price  for  gasoline,  $2.00  per  gallon,  is  assumed  in  Figure  2.  The  cost-efficient 
level,  the  maximum  net  value  to  the  consumer,  is  reached  at  36  miles  per  gallon 
(MPG), 28 percent higher than the base year passenger car fuel economy.

Why  doesn’t  the  market  produce  this  level  of  fuel  economy  without  being  com-
pelled by fuel economy standards? I addressed this question in my January 7, 2007 
testimony  to  the  Senate  Energy  Committee.  Like  the  market  for  most  other  energy 
using  consumer  durable  goods,  the  market  for  automotive  fuel  economy  is  not  effi-
cient. At the time of vehicle purchase, consumers do not fully value future fuel sav-
ings  and  therefore  manufacturers,  in  general,  do  not  make  vehicles  as  energy  effi-
cient  as  they  would  if  the  market  itself  were  efficient.  It  is  more  effective  to  sell 
cars based on other features that excite car buyers. And, of course, few new car buy-
ers  will  voluntarily  and  on  their  own  initiative  pay  more  for  the  public  benefits  of 
reduced U.S. oil dependence or greenhouse gas emissions. 

Figure  2  also  shows  that  it  is  possible  to  push  beyond  36  MPG,  to  40  or  even  42 
MPG  with  little  loss  of  net  value  ($100  to  $300  per  vehicle).  This  range  of  36  to 
42  MPG,  approximately  a  30  percent  to  50  percent  increase  in  fuel  economy,  is 
where  judgment  about  the  importance  of  reducing  oil  use  and  carbon  dioxide  emis-
sions should be exercised. 

In June of 2006, in response to a request from Senators Obama, Lugar and Biden, 
I calculated cost-efficient levels of light-duty vehicle fuel economy increases at high-
er gasoline prices than assumed in the NRC (2002) report. The results are summa-
rized  in  Table  1  below.  I  used  the  NRC  ‘‘average’’  fuel  economy  cost  curves  for  all 
the  numbers  presented  in  Table  1.  Cost  and  savings  estimates  are  in  2005  dollars. 
The  calculations  in  Table  1  apply  to  passenger  cars  and  light  trucks  combined,  un-
like Figure 2 which applies only to passenger cars.

As with all such analyses, there are some caveats. The NRC study is now 5 years 
old, and there have been significant technological developments since its publication. 
Some  of  the  technologies  used  to  construct  the  NRC  fuel  economy  cost  functions 
have already been adopted in existing vehicles but have been used to increase power 
and  weight  rather  than  fuel  economy.  On  the  other  hand,  important  new  tech-
nologies  have  also  been  developed.  Second,  at  fuel  costs  above  $3.50  per  gallon  the 
indicated  cost-efficient  fuel  economy  levels  are  beyond  the  range  of  what  could  be 
achieved  using  the  fuel  economy  technologies  considered  by  the  NRC  study.  These 
numbers are printed in italics in Table 1. 

The  cost-efficient  analysis  assumes  constant  light-duty  vehicle  weight  and  per-
formance.  Fuel  economy  technology  can  also  be  used  to  increase  horsepower  and 
weight  while  holding  fuel  economy  constant.  Setting  fuel  economy  standards  in-
volves an implicit judgment about the importance of having even heavier and more 
powerful vehicles than we have today versus reducing oil dependence and mitigating 
greenhouse gas emissions. 

The cost efficient analysis is limited to existing, proven fuel economy technologies. 
There is no doubt that technological advances will be made over the next 10 years. 
This  fact  allows  decisionmakers  to  have  greater  confidence  that  the  targets  set  can 
be achieved without harm to the automobile industry or to motorists. Indeed, when 
the NRC committee finished its study just 5 years ago, it concluded that neither hy-
brid  nor  clean  diesel  engines  could  be  considered  proven  technologies.  Today  there 
are  a  dozen  hybrid  models  to  choose  from  and  clean  diesels  will  soon  be  available. 
The  cost-efficient  method  does  not  rely  on  technological  progress  but  it  does  expect 
it. 
Market-based Alternatives to CAFE 

Fuel economy standards are not the only effective way to realize greater fuel econ-
omy. Feebates are a way to emphasize the value of reducing petroleum via the pur-
chase  price  of  vehicles  rather  than  future  fuel  savings.  Feebates  give  a  rebate  to 
purchasers of low fuel consumption vehicles and impose a fee on buyers of high fuel 
consumption  vehicles.  While  feebate  systems  can  take  many  forms,  perhaps  the 
most  appropriate  formulation  bases  the  rebate  or  fee  on  fuel  consumption  (gallons 
per mile), thereby giving equal value to every gallon of fuel saved. 

Feebate systems consist of a pivot point and a rate. Vehicles whose fuel consump-
tion  is  below  the  pivot  point  receive  a  rebate  while  vehicles  with  fuel  consumption 
above  the  pivot  point  are  charged  a  fee.  There  can  be  a  single  pivot  point  or  dif-
ferent  pivot  points  for  different  types  of  vehicles.  The  rate  specifies  the  additional 
value of saving fuel. Feebate rates on the order of $1,000 to $1,500 per 0.01 gallons 
per  mile  should  achieve  fleet  average  fuel  economy  improvements  of  30  percent  to 
50  percent  (Greene  et  al.,  2005).  The  feebate  rate  determines  the  incentive  to  use 
fuel economy technology to increase fuel economy. The pivot point determines which 
vehicles gain (receive a rebate) and which vehicles lose (pay a fee). 

Feebates have two important advantages over fuel economy standards. First, they 
are  a  continuing  incentive  to  adopt  energy  efficient  technologies  and  use  them  to 
increase fuel economy. Once a fuel economy standard has been met, there is no ad-
ditional  incentive  for  manufacturers  to  increase  fuel  economy  beyond  the  value  of 
future  fuel  savings  to  consumers.  A  feebate  system  (especially  if  indexed  for  infla-
tion)  provides  a  continuing  added  incentive.  There  is  always  a  rebate  to  be  gained 
or  a  fee  to  be  avoided.  Second,  feebates  put  a  cap  on  the  costs  manufacturers  will 
have  to  incur  to  increase  fuel  economy.  Manufacturers  are  required  to  meet  fuel

economy  standards  regardless  of  the  cost.1 There  is  no  reason  why  a  manufacturer 
would  spend  more  to  gain  a  rebate  or  avoid  a  fee  than  its  value.  Thus,  the  feebate 
rate  puts  a  cap  on  the  economic  costs  that  might  be  incurred  to  increase  fuel  econ-
omy. 

The  chief  disadvantage  of  feebate  systems  is  that  they  do  not  guarantee  that  a 
desired  level  of  fuel  economy  improvement  will  be  achieved.  Feebates  depend  on 
manufacturers and consumers efficiently trading off the higher cost of fuel economy 
technology  and  the  value  of  rebates  or  fees.  Since  both  affect  the  purchase  price  of 
a  vehicle,  there  is  good  reason  to  expect  markets  to  respond  efficiently,  but  there 
is no guarantee. 

Today, we have half of a feebate system for passenger cars in the form of the Gas- 
Guzzler  Tax.  There  is  no  comparable  policy  for  light  trucks.  I  can  think  of  no  good 
reason  for  taxing  inefficient  passenger  cars  but  not  light  trucks.  Furthermore,  half 
of a feebate system is less than half as effective as a full feebate system. I urge you 
to  consider  a  complete  well  formulated  feebate  system  for  all  light-duty  vehicles. 
Should  you  decide  not  to  implement  a  complete  feebate  system,  I  would  urge  you 
to  abolish  the  gas-guzzler  tax  for  passenger  cars  in  favor  of  higher  fuel  economy 
standards for all light-duty vehicles. 
What Form? 

Critics of the CAFE system have raised many objections to it over the past thirty 
years.  Two  criticisms  have  been  especially  potent  in  preventing  progress:  CAFE  is 
unfair.  CAFE  is  unsafe.  The  first  is  accurate.  The  second  is  incorrect.  I  have  ad-
dressed  the  safety  issues  in  other  testimony  and  other  publications  (Greene,  2005; 
Greene and Keller, 2002; Greene, 2007). Regardless of one’s viewpoint on these two 
issues, the reformed CAFE standard adopted by the National Highway Traffic Safe-
ty Administration (NHTSA) for light trucks nullifies both criticisms. It adjusts each 
manufacturer’s standard according to the size mix of vehicles it produces. It removes 
any incentive for downsizing that an unreformed CAFE system might create. At the 
same  time,  it  keeps  nearly  all  significant  fuel  economy  technologies  in  play.  It  also 
creates  the  opportunity  to  finally  eliminate  the  distinction  between  cars  and  light 
trucks  in  a  unified  set  of  footprint-based  standards.  I  congratulate  the  staff  of 
NHTSA for this important innovation. 

However,  there  is  one  loose  end  that  needs  to  be  tidied  up.  The  NHTSA  should 
have done a careful automotive engineering analysis of the potential for a footprint- 
based  standard  to  have  unintended  consequences.  Is  it  likely  to  cause  design 
changes  that  could  be  undesirable  with  respect  to  safety,  consumer  satisfaction,  or 
roadway  geometry?  I  doubt  it.  But  prudent  regulation  requires  that  such  possibili-
ties be expertly examined. And so, if the Senate decides to proceed with a footprint- 
based fuel economy standard, I urge you to require that such a study be done. 

Let  me  add  that  feebates  can  take  as  many  forms  as  fuel  economy  standards. 
There  is  no  reason,  for  example,  why  a  footprint-based  feebate  system  could  not  be 
implemented.  Instead  of  basing  the  feebate  rate  on  gallons  per  mile,  it  would  be 
based on gallons per footprint mile (square feet × miles) 
Who Should Decide? 

An important issue that has received too little analysis is who should set the fuel 
economy standards? Should it be the Congress or the Executive Branch? If it is the 
Executive  Branch,  should  it  be  the  Department  of  Transportation,  the  Department 
of Energy or the Environmental Protection Agency? In 1975, Congress set ambitious 
standards for passenger cars and left the establishment of standards for light trucks 
to  the  NHTSA.  The  result  was  less  ambitious  standards  for  light  trucks.  Yet  over 
the  past  few  years,  NHTSA  has  raised  the  light  truck  standards  twice  by  modest 
but  meaningful  amounts  and  has  instituted  important  changes  in  the  form  of  the 
standards.  Congress  has  not  raised  the  passenger  car  standards  in  more  than  30 
years. In my opinion, a one time increase in fuel economy standards will not be ade-
quate to address the problems of climate change and of oil dependence. A 50 percent 
increase  in  fuel  economy  by  2020  would  need  to  be  followed  by  an  increase  of  100 
percent over current levels by 2030. 

I don’t claim to know who should set fuel economy standards but I do have some 
observations  that  I  believe  are  relevant.  First,  oil  dependence  is  a  problem  that  we 
‘‘solved’’  temporarily  and  incompletely  twenty  years  ago.  And  when  we  ‘‘solved’’  the 
problem  we  seemed  to  lose  interest  in  the  policies  necessary  to  keep  it  solved.  And 

1 Fuel  economy  standards  may  include  flexible  provisions  to  limit  excess  costs.  For  example, 
the CAFE standards allow the NHTSA to grant a measure of relief to manufacturers by tempo-
rarily reducing the fuel economy standards in the event that unanticipated circumstances make 
it especially difficult to meet the CAFE requirements.

so  it  has  come  back.  We  will  be  struggling  with  the  problem  of  climate  change,  in 
my  opinion,  for  decades,  much  as  we  have  done  with  urban  air  pollution.  Indeed, 
climate  change  appears  to  be  even  more  difficult  and  has  a  much  longer  time  hori-
zon.  Twenty  years  from  now,  I  think  that  it  will  still  be  clear  that  we  have  not 
solved  the  problem  of  climate  change  and  that  we  must  keep  working  at  it.  In  my 
view,  this  argues  for  locating  the  authority  over  fuel  economy  standards  with  the 
agency  that  has  the  greatest  interest  in  and  responsibility  for  addressing  climate 
change. 
Congressional Guidance Is Needed 

If  Congress  elects  not  to  set  fuel  economy  targets  itself,  it  is  absolutely  critical 
that Congress give clear and strong guidance about the importance of fuel economy 
standards  to  addressing  the  problems  of  oil  dependence,  greenhouse  gas  emissions 
and  sustainable  energy  for  transportation.  There  are  many  ways  that  strong  guid-
ance  could  be  given.  It  could  take  the  form  of  statements  about  the  importance  of 
the  problems  fuel  economy  standards  help  solve.  It  could  be  in  the  form  of  rec-
ommended targets. 

Regardless of the form of its guidance, Congress should clearly express to the reg-
ulating  agency  how  important  increasing  fuel  economy  is  to  solving  our  oil  depend-
ence  problem,  mitigating  carbon  dioxide  emissions  to  reduce  the  probability  of  dan-
gerous  climate  change,  and  developing  sustainable  energy  sources  for  transpor-
tation. Congress’ guidance should be clear and emphatic enough to sustain progress 
when  some  might  think  the  oil  dependence  problem  is  solved.  It  should  give  clear 
direction to regulators about the importance of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions 
versus  continuing  the  horsepower  race.  As  the  2002  NRC  report  pointed  out,  Con-
gress has both the authority and responsibility for establishing the priority of these 
societal goals. 

Thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  present  my  views.  I  hope  they  are  helpful  as 

you pursue your important work. I look forward to your questions.

STATEMENT OF TOM STRICKER, DIRECTOR, TECHNICAL AND 

REGULATORY AFFAIRS, TOYOTA MOTOR NORTH AMERICA 
Mr. STRICKER. Thank you, Senator Pryor, and good afternoon. 
Toyota believes that reducing America’s reliance on petroleum re-
quires a coordinated national strategy that addresses the challenge 
at every opportunity. From a vehicle perspective, there is no single 
fuel  or  technology  solution.  Simply  put,  there  is  no  silver  bullet.

This  is  why  Toyota  is  pursuing  multiple  technology  paths,  includ-
ing  advanced  gasoline/diesel  engines,  hydrogen  fuel  cells,  and  eth-
anol-capable vehicles. Underpinning all of this is our hybrid electric 
power-train strategy, which is a core strategy for Toyota in the fu-
ture. And we are actively researching plug-in hybrids. 

As  of  January  of  2007,  we’ve  sold  over  866,000  hybrids  globally, 
including 472,000 here in the U.S. But hybrids still represent only 
about 2 percent of new vehicle sales in this country. 

Some  have  characterized  hybrid  technology  as  an  interim  ap-
proach.  We  view  hybrids  as  an  integral  approach  of  our  vehicle 
strategy  for  the  long  term,  and  we  intend  to  incorporate  it  across 
our product line when and where it makes sense. 

Toyota  supports  increasing  both  car  and  truck  CAFE  standards 
in a way that balances our need to reduce oil consumption with the 
practical  realities  of  technology  development,  product  cycles,  con-
sumer  behavior,  and  a  level  competitive  playing  field.  We  believe 
NHTSA is best suited to evaluate these issues and set future CAFE 
standards. 

By moving to a size-based system, where each manufacturer has 
its own target for CAFE based on the vehicles it sells, NHTSA has 
eliminated  concerns  about  the  competitive  impact  of  CAFE  for 
trucks.  Further,  no  longer  can  downsizing,  which  many  claim  may 
have  negative  safety  consequences,  be  used  as  a  compliance  tool. 
The net result is that improving CAFE will require every manufac-
turer  to  apply  technology  across  every  type  of  vehicle.  We  support 
Congress  giving  NHTSA  the  authority  to  consider  a  similar  at-
tribute-based reform for cars. 

What else can Congress do? First, the administration’s requested 
authority  for  a  credit-trading  system  among  auto  manufacturers. 
We  believe  the  likelihood  of  manufacturers  trading  among  one  an-
other  is  much  lower  than  a  manufacturer  trading  within  its  own 
regulated  fleet  of  vehicles.  Trading  within  a  manufacturer’s  own 
fleets  would  likely  provide—would  likely  prove  more  useful,  so  we 
encourage  Congress  to  consider  both  of  these  options  as  you  move 
forward. 

Second,  Congress  should  continue  to  reject  any  form  of  CAFE 
standards that discourage early compliance. For example, requiring 
a uniform percentage increase in CAFE penalizes early compliance 
by locking manufacturers with higher CAFE into higher standards, 
precluding  them  from  competing  in  certain  market  segments  even 
if their products in those segments are more fuel efficient. The Na-
tional  Academy  of  Sciences  has  repeatedly  rejected  UPI  as  a  coun-
terproductive approach to fuel savings. 

Another  way  Congress  can  incentivize  early  compliance  is  to  ex-
tend  the  life  of  earned  CAFE  credits  from  the  current  3  years  to 
something  longer,  perhaps  5  years.  Again,  this  would  not  only  re-
ward early compliance, but would provide another tool for manufac-
turers to cope with CAFE increases. 

Finally, Toyota was pleased that Congress recognized the need to 
bring  consumers  into  the  equation  by  passing  the  consumer  tax 
credits  contained  in  EPAct  2005.  Indeed,  these  credits  helped  to 
move and strengthen the market for hybrid vehicles. As you know, 
the amount of the credit available to consumers begins phasing out 
after  a  manufacturer  sells  60,000  eligible  vehicles.  We  urge  Con-

gress  to  lift  the  cap  on  eligible—vehicles  eligible  for  the  credit  in 
order  to  stimulate  even  greater  demand  and  bring  the  cost  of  new 
technology down. 

While we urge you to consider these potential enhancements, we 
continue to believe that NHTSA is best equipped to weigh the var-
ious tradeoffs inherent in setting the level of CAFE standards. 

One  real  challenge  in  setting  future  fuel-economy  requirements 
is  understanding  the  pace  at  which  available  technology  can  be 
added  in  the  context  of  product  cycles.  Once  we  commit  to  a  tech-
nology strategy for a given model, it’s generally a 4- to 6-year com-
mitment.  Unfortunately,  this  means  we  can’t  add  technology  every 
year to every model, even if the technology is, quote, ‘‘on the shelf.’’ 
To  put  this  into  perspective,  the  recent  2  percent  rate  of  increase 
established by NHTSA for trucks would require an 11 percent fuel 
economy improvement in every model every time it was redesigned. 
By the same token, a 4 percent increase would require a 20 percent 
improvement  in  every  vehicle  model  every  time  it  was  redesigned 
as a result of 4- to 6-year product cycles. 

In  closing,  Toyota  has  a  strong  record  of  bringing  advanced  fuel 
economy  technology  to  market  and  achieving  leading  levels  of  fuel 
economy.  We’ve  always  exceeded  CAFE  standards.  In  fact,  over 
their  lifetime,  the  past  10  model  years  of  Toyota  vehicles  sold  in 
the  U.S.  will  consume  11  billion  fewer  gallons  of  gasoline  than 
what  the  law  would  have  allowed.  These  same  vehicles  will  emit 
over  100  million  metric  tons  less  CO2 than  if  we  had  simply  met 
the  CAFE  standards.  Our  core  philosophy  is  one  of  continuous  im-
provement.  This  will  drive  us  to  pursue  additional  technology  ad-
vances in the years to come. 

Thank you, once again, and I look forward to your questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF TOM STRICKER, DIRECTOR, TECHNICAL AND REGULATORY 

AFFAIRS, TOYOTA MOTOR NORTH AMERICA 

Good  morning  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  My  name  is  Tom 
Stricker. I am Director of Technical and Regulatory Affairs for Toyota, and I appre-
ciate the invitation to share Toyota’s views on the Corporate Average Fuel Economy 
program. 

We  believe  that  in  order  to  reduce  America’s  reliance  on  petroleum  and  reduce 
CO2 emissions, we must develop a coordinated national strategy that addresses the 
challenge  at  every  opportunity,  including  all  oil-consuming  sectors  of  the  economy, 
consumers, the fuels themselves, and of course, improved vehicle fuel efficiency. 

While we should not understate the importance of a multi-faceted approach, I will 

focus my remarks today on vehicle efficiency and the CAFE program. 

From a vehicle perspective, there is no single fuel or technology that can, by itself, 
solve  these  challenges.  Simply  put,  there’s  no  silver  bullet.  This  is  why  Toyota  is 
pursuing multiple technology paths, including advanced gasoline and diesel engines, 
hydrogen  fuel  cells,  and  ethanol-capable  vehicles.  Underpinning  all  of  this,  our  hy-
brid-electric  powertrain  has  become  a  core  technology  for  Toyota,  and  we  are  ac-
tively researching plug-in hybrids. 

As of January 2007 we have sold over 866,000 hybrids globally, including 472,000 
in the U.S., where we offer six hybrid models covering a wide range of vehicle types 
and  buyers.  In  spite  of  these  numbers,  hybrids  still  represent  only  about  2  percent 
of U.S. new vehicle sales. 

Some  have  characterized  hybrid  technology  as  an  interim  approach—a  bridge  to 
fuel cells. In our view, this underestimates the value of the hybrid system. The fuel 
cell vehicles we are testing in the United States are themselves hybrids and, in fact, 
use  many  of  the  same  components  found  in  our  current  hybrid  vehicles.  We  view 
hybrids  as  an  integral  approach  to  our  vehicle  strategy  for  the  long-term  and  we

intend  to  incorporate  it  across  our  product  line  when  and  where  it  makes  sense  to 
do so. 

While  CAFE  may  not  be  a  perfect  system,  it  appears  it  will  remain  a  key  part 
of  the  solution  to  improving  fuel  economy  for  the  foreseeable  future.  To  that  end, 
Toyota  supports  increasing  both  car  and  truck  CAFE  standards,  in  a  way  that  bal-
ances  our  need  to  reduce  oil  consumption  with  the  practical  realities  of  technology 
development,  product  cycles,  consumer  behavior  and  a  level  competitive  playing 
field.  We  believe  NHTSA  is  best  suited  to  evaluate  these  issues  and  determine  fu-
ture CAFE standards. 

The recent reform by NHTSA of the light-truck CAFE standards is a good exam-
ple of changes that can be made within the CAFE program to enhance its effective-
ness and address some of the key criticisms of the past. 

By  moving  to  an  attribute-based  system,  where  each  manufacturer  has  its  own 
CAFE  target  based  on  the  vehicles  it  sells,  concerns  about  the  competitive  impacts 
of CAFE for trucks have been eliminated. Further, no longer can downsizing, which 
many  claim  may  have  negative  safety  consequences,  be  used  as  a  compliance  tool. 
The net result is that improving CAFE will require application of technology across 
every  type  of  vehicle.  While  Toyota  remains  comfortable  operating  in  either  the  old 
CAFE system or the new reformed system, we support Congress giving NHTSA the 
authority  to  consider  attribute-based  CAFE  reform  for  cars.  It  is  not  clear  sitting 
here  today  what  would  be  the  appropriate  attribute  for  cars,  but  NHTSA  should  to 
be given authority to examine a range of options. 

We think there is even more that Congress can do to improve the CAFE program: 
First,  as  standards  are  increased,  one  way  to  help  industry  meet  higher  standards 
is to increase compliance flexibility. The Administration has requested authority for 
a  credit  trading  system  among  auto  manufacturers.  We  believe  the  likelihood  of 
manufacturers  trading  among  each  other  is  much  lower  than  a  manufacturer  trad-
ing  within  its  own  regulated  fleets—that  is,  between  its  own  car  and  truck  fleets, 
and  between  its  own  import  and  domestic  car  fleets.  Although  not  included  in  the 
Administration’s  request,  trading  within  a  manufacturer’s  fleets  would  likely  prove 
more  useful,  and  we  would  encourage  you  to  consider  both  of  these  options  as  you 
move  forward.  CAFE  is  by  definition  an  averaging  program—some  vehicles  are 
above the standard while others are below, but the overall target must still be met. 
This same thinking should apply not just across vehicle models, but also across reg-
ulated  fleets.  It  is  less  important  whether  energy  savings  and  emissions  reductions 
are  achieved  in  one  fleet  or  the  other,  so  long  as  overall  reductions  are  achieved. 
The  second  area  where  Congress  can  help  is  through  incentives  for  early  compli-
ance.  To  this  end,  Congress  should  continue  to  reject  any  form  of  CAFE  standards 
that  would  discourage  early  compliance.  One  example  that  would  have  such  per-
verse impacts is a requiring a uniform percentage increase in manufacturer’s CAFE. 
UPI—as  its  known—clearly  penalizes  early  compliance  by  locking  manufacturers 
with higher CAFE into higher standards. This has the practical result of precluding 
them  from  competing  in  certain  market  segments,  even  if  their  products  in  those 
segments  are  more  fuel  efficient.  The  National  Academy  of  Sciences  has  repeatedly 
rejected UPI as a counterproductive approach to fuel savings. 

Another  way  Congress  can  incentivize  early  compliance  is  to  extend  the  life  of 
earned CAFE credits from the current 3 years to something longer, perhaps 5 years. 
Again,  this  would  not  only  reward  early  compliance  but  would  provide  another  tool 
for manufacturers to cope with CAFE increases. 

The  final  area  involves  the  consumer.  Actions  to  stimulate  consumer  demand  for 
more  efficient  vehicles  are  a  key  part  of  any  comprehensive  approach  to  reducing 
petroleum use and CO2. In addition, consumer purchasing decisions directly impact 
a manufacturer’s compliance with CAFE standards. 

Toyota was pleased that Congress recognized the need to bring consumers into the 
equation  by  passing  the  consumer  tax  credits  contained  in  EPAct  2005.  Indeed, 
these credits helped to move and strengthen the market for hybrid vehicles. As you 
know,  the  amount  of  the  credit  available  to  consumers  begins  phasing-out  once  a 
manufacturer sells 60,000 eligible vehicles. We urge Congress to lift the cap on vehi-
cles  eligible  for  the  credit  in  order  to  stimulate  greater  demand  and  bring  the  cost 
of new technology down. 

While  we  urge  Congress  to  consider  these  potential  legislative  enhancements  to 
the  CAFE  program,  we  continue  to  believe  that  NHTSA  is  best  equipped  to  weigh 
the  various  trade-offs  inherent  in  setting  the  level  of  future  CAFE  standards,  such 
as manufacturers’ confidential product plans, product design cycles, technology cost, 
technology  availability,  and  other  factors.  In  our  view,  the  real  challenge  in  tar-
geting  future  fuel  economy  potential  is  the  pace  at  which  technology  can  be  devel-
oped, its cost, fuel prices, consumer preferences, and perhaps most importantly—the 
extent  to  which  available  technology  can  be  added  in  the  context  of  product  cycles.

When we design a vehicle, we have to predict what our customers will want some 
4–6  years  into  the  future  in  order  to  complete  development,  testing  and  re-testing, 
production  preparation,  supplier  development,  government  certification,  and  ulti-
mately,  production.  Once  we  commit  to  a  technology  strategy  for  a  given  model,  it 
is  generally  a  4  to  6  year  commitment.  Unfortunately,  this  means  we  cannot  add 
technology to every vehicle every year, even if technology is ‘‘on-the-shelf’’. 

To  put  this  into  perspective,  the  2.2  percent  annual  truck  increase  promulgated 
by  NHTSA  for  seven  consecutive  model  years—if  continued  into  the  future—would 
require  about  an  11  percent  fuel  economy  improvement  in  every  model,  every  time 
it was redesigned. This is a significant challenge given the often competing demands 
by consumers. By the same token, a 4 percent annual increase would require about 
a 20 percent improvement in every model, every time as a result of 4–6 year product 
cycles. 

Targeting future fuel economy improvements hinges on many factors that require 

detailed analyses that NHTSA is best suited to evaluate. 

In  closing,  Toyota  has  a  strong  track  record  of  bringing  advanced  fuel  economy 
technology to market and achieving leading levels of fuel economy. We’ve always ex-
ceeded  CAFE  standards—in  fact,  over  their  lifetime,  the  past  ten  model  years  of 
Toyota  vehicles  sold  in  the  U.S.  will  consume  11  billion  fewer  gallons  of  gasoline 
(or  nearly  265  million  fewer  barrels  of  oil)  than  what  the  law  would  have  allowed. 
These same vehicles will emit over 100 million metric tons less CO2 than if we had 
simply  met  the  CAFE  standards.  Our  core  philosophy  of  ‘‘continuous  improvement’’ 
will drive us to pursue additional technology advances in the years to come. Thank 
you once again, and I’d be happy to answer any questions.

STATEMENT  OF  ALAN  REUTHER,  LEGISLATIVE  DIRECTOR, 
INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE 
&  AGRICULTURAL  IMPLEMENT  WORKERS  OF  AMERICA 
(UAW) 
Mr.  REUTHER.  Mr.  Chairman,  my  name  is  Alan  Reuther.  I  am 
the  Legislative  Director  for  the  UAW.  We  appreciate  the  oppor-
tunity to testify at this hearing on the CAFE program.

UAW  believes  that  global  warming  and  our  Nation’s  dependence 
on  foreign  oil  are  serious  problems  that  need  to  be  addressed  by 
Congress and the Bush administration. However, it is important to 
recognize  that  the  CAFE  program,  by  itself,  cannot  solve  these 
problems.  UAW  supports  the  establishment  of  an  economy-wide, 
mandatory,  tradable  permits  program  that  will  reduce  greenhouse 
gas  emissions.  We  believe  this  type  of  cap-and-trade  program 
should  be  done  on  an  upstream  basis  in  order  to  minimize  regula-
tion  and  to  assure  that  all  sectors  of  the  economy  participate  in  a 
proportionate manner. 

The UAW also believes Congress should pursue initiatives to pro-
mote  the  use  of  alternative  fuels  in  motor  vehicles.  We  would  sup-
port legislation mandating that a certain percentage of all vehicles 
sold  in  the  U.S.  by  each  automaker  must  be  flex-fuel  capable  by 
specified  dates.  We  also  believe  there  is  a  need  for  incentives  to 
overcome  bottlenecks  in  the  production  and  distribution  networks 
for alternative fuels. 

In addition, the UAW urges Congress to use tax and other incen-
tives  to  encourage  domestic  production  of  advanced  technology  ve-
hicles,  the  hybrids  and  diesels,  and  their  key  components.  As  was 
demonstrated  by  a  November  2004  study  by  the  University  of 
Michigan,  this  type  of  approach  would  create  thousands  of  auto-
motive  jobs  in  this  country,  while  reducing  global  warming  emis-
sions and our dependence on foreign oil. 

The  Bush  administration  has  requested  the  authority  to  estab-
lish  an  attribute-based  CAFE  system  for  passenger  cars  similar  to 
the  system  that  NHTSA  has  already  implemented  for  light  trucks. 
The  UAW  recognizes  that  this  approach  would  eliminate  the  dis-
criminatory  impact  of  the  current  passenger  car  CAFE  rules 
against  full-line  producers.  However,  it  would  also  enable  auto 
manufacturers to offshore all of their small car production and jobs. 
Over 17,000 American workers are currently employed in five U.S. 
assembly  plants  that  produce  small  passenger  cars.  Almost  50,000 
American  workers  produce  parts  for  these  vehicles.  To  prevent 
companies  from  offshoring  these  jobs,  and  to  prevent  companies 
from subverting the objective of any new CAFE system by upsizing 
many of their vehicles, resulting in worse overall fuel economy, the 
UAW urges Congress to impose an anti-backsliding requirement on 
any  new  CAFE  rules.  This  requirement  should  specify  that  both 
the  domestic  and  foreign  passenger  car  fleets  for  each  auto  manu-
facturer  would  still  have  to  meet  or  exceed  the  CAFE  standard 
under the current system. 

Some  Members  of  Congress  have  put  forward  proposals  to  in-
crease  CAFE  to  35  mpg  for  the  combined  passenger  car  and  light 
truck  fleets,  or  to  40  mpg  for  passenger  cars,  or  to  require  4  per-
cent  annual  increases  in  the  CAFE  standards.  The  UAW  is  deeply 
concerned about the economic feasibility of these proposals. In light 
of  the  extremely  serious  financial  conditions  of  GM,  Ford,  and 
DaimlerChrysler  and  the  disparate  burdens  they  face  in  retiree 
health  care  legacy  costs,  the  UAW  believes  that  the  imposition  of 
CAFE increases of this magnitude could lead to calamitous results. 
This  could  include  the  closing  of  additional  facilities  and  the  loss 
of  tens  of  thousands  of  additional  automotive  jobs,  as  well  as  the 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  08:33 Apr 16, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00091 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\80088.TXT JACKIE

88 

loss  of  health  coverage  for  500,000  retired  workers  and  their  fami-
lies. 

In order to meet higher CAFE standards, the auto manufacturers 
will have to incur significant retooling costs. But the companies do 
not  have  a  level  playing  field,  in  terms  of  their  ability  to  shoulder 
these  retooling  costs.  Thus,  the  UAW  believes  that  any  proposals 
for  CAFE  increases  must  also  include  measures  that  will  help  to 
level  the  playing  field  in  the  automotive  industry  and  provide 
struggling manufacturers with the resources needed for any retool-
ing efforts. Such assistance should be tied to investments in domes-
tic  production  that  will  generate  jobs  for  American  workers  and 
help  the  U.S.  economy.  It  should  also  be  structured  in  a  manner 
that recognizes and helps to address the fundamental imbalance in 
the auto industry related to retiree health care legacy costs. 

Rather  than  simply  turn  to  the  CAFE  program,  the  UAW  urges 
Congress  to  consider  other  mechanisms  for  improving  vehicle  effi-
ciency  that  might  be  more  consistent  with  economy-wide  efforts  to 
reduce  oil  consumption  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  For  exam-
ple,  Congress  should  explore  whether  it  would  be  better  to  estab-
lish  carbon  reduction  requirements  that  each  auto  manufacturer 
would  have  to  meet.  This  approach  might  be  more  effective  in 
achieving  the  desired  objectives  of  greenhouse  gas  reductions  and 
oil  savings,  and  it  would  also  avoid  some  of  the  gaming  and  other 
complications that have plagued the CAFE program. 

In conclusion, the UAW looks forward to working with this com-
mittee  in  fashioning  measures  that  will  enable  the  U.S.  to  make 
progress  in  addressing  the  climate  change  and  energy  security 
issues while protecting jobs and benefits for American workers and 
retirees. 

Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Reuther follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ALAN REUTHER,  LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR,  INTERNATIONAL 
UNION,  UNITED AUTOMOBILE,  AEROSPACE &  AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS 
OF AMERICA (UAW) 
Mr.  Chairman,  my  name  is  Alan  Reuther.  I  am  the  Legislative  Director  for  the 
International  Union,  United  Automobile,  Aerospace  &  Agricultural  Implement 
Workers  of  America  (UAW).  The  UAW  appreciates  the  opportunity  to  testify  before 
this  Committee  at  this  oversight  hearing  on  the  Corporate  Average  Fuel  Economy 
(CAFE) program. 

The UAW represents over one million active and retired workers across the coun-
try, many of whom work or receive retirement benefits from auto manufacturers or 
auto  parts  companies.  We  were  deeply  involved  in  the  original  enactment  of  the 
CAFE program, and continue to have a very strong interest in this program because 
of its impact on automotive production and employment in this country and the jobs 
and benefits of our members. 

Interest  in  the  CAFE  program  has  recently  been  heightened  by  a  number  of  fac-
tors. This includes the national security implications of our Nation’s dependence on 
foreign  oil.  It  also  includes  rising  concerns  about  global  warming  and  the  need  to 
limit greenhouse gas emissions. 

The  UAW  believes  that  these  are  serious  problems  that  need  to  be  addressed  by 
Congress and the Bush administration. We urge Congress to pursue initiatives that 
will deal with these issues in an integrated and balanced manner. 
Need for Economy-Wide Energy Policies 

It  is  important  to  recognize  that  the  CAFE  program,  by  itself,  cannot  solve  these 
problems.  All  light  duty  vehicles  (passenger  cars  and  light  trucks)  in  the  United 
States  only  account  for  16.3  percent  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  CAFE  pro-
gram only affects new vehicles sold each year, which represent a very small percent-

89 

age (about 7 percent) of the total vehicle stock on the road. It takes about 14 years 
for  the  U.S.  vehicle  fleet  to  completely  turn  over.  Thus,  by  definition  any  changes 
in CAFE can only have a modest short-term impact on reducing our greenhouse gas 
emissions and dependence on foreign oil. 

To  address  these  problems  in  a  meaningful  way,  the  UAW  believes  we  need 
broader,  comprehensive  energy  policies.  In  our  judgment,  these  policies  should  re-
quire all sectors of the economy to come to the table and help to reduce our Nation’s 
oil  consumption  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Each  sector  should  be  required  to 
contribute  to  these  objectives  in  proportion  to  the  oil  consumption  and  greenhouse 
gas  emissions  of  that  sector.  No  sector  should  enjoy  a  free  ride.  No  sector  should 
be required to bear a disproportionate burden, or to shoulder costs that would have 
a devastating impact on production and employment in specific industries. 

To be sure, the auto industry has an important role to play in addressing the en-
ergy security and climate change issues. The UAW is prepared to support legislation 
that  requires  the  industry  to  do  its  share,  so  long  as  this  is  part  of  broader  meas-
ures that also require other sectors to share proportionately in the burdens that will 
be required to meet these challenges. 

Specifically,  the  UAW  strongly  supports  the  establishment  of  an  economy-wide 
mandatory  tradable-permits  program  that  will  gradually  slow  the  growth  of,  and 
eventually  reduce,  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  the  United  States.  We  believe  this 
type  of  ‘‘cap-and-trade’’  program  should  be  done  on  an  ‘‘upstream’’  basis  in  order  to 
minimize  regulation  and  to  ensure  that  all  sectors  of  the  economy  participate  in  a 
proportionate  manner.  We  also  believe  such  a  program  should  include  a  ‘‘safety 
valve’’ cost cap to ensure that no sector is hit with unacceptable burdens that would 
have  a  negative  impact  on  economic  growth  and  jobs.  In  addition,  this  program 
should  include  measures  to  ensure  that  our  businesses  and  workers  are  not  placed 
at  an  unfair  competitive  disadvantage  with  U.S.  trading  partners  and  developing 
countries. 

The UAW believes that this type of ‘‘cap-and-trade’’ program could make a major 
contribution  to  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  our  dependence  on  foreign 
oil. 
Promotion of Alternative Fuels 

At the same time, the UAW recognizes the need for additional measures to reduce 
oil  consumption  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  the  automotive  sector.  But,  to 
be successful, it is essential that this effort focus on two interrelated factors: (1) the 
fuels that go into vehicles; and (2) the efficiency of these vehicles themselves. 

The UAW believes it is critically important for Congress to pursue a range of ini-
tiatives to promote the use of alternative fuels in motor vehicles. This can make an 
enormous  contribution  to  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  our  reliance  on 
foreign oil. 

Obviously,  there  is  a  need  to  promote  the  production  of  vehicles  that  are  capable 
of  running  on  alternative  fuels.  The  technology  required  to  make  vehicles  flex  fuel 
capable  is  relatively  inexpensive—about  $150  per  vehicle.  GM,  Ford  and  DCX  have 
already voluntarily committed to making 50 percent of their fleets flex fuel capable 
by 2012. The UAW would support legislation mandating that certain percentages of 
all  vehicles  sold  in  the  U.S.  by  each  automaker  must  be  flex-fuel  capable  by  speci-
fied dates. Meanwhile, to avoid any counterproductive disincentive, the CAFE credit 
for flex fuel vehicles should be extended and expanded to cover bio-diesel. 

To  expand  the  use  of  alternative  fuels,  there  is  also  a  need  to  overcome  bottle-
necks  in  the  production  and  distribution  networks.  Thus,  the  UAW  supports  the 
continuation  of  existing  incentives  for  the  production  of  bio-fuels.  We  also  support 
additional  incentives  to  encourage  the  conversion  of  existing  filling  stations  so  they 
have the capability to distribute alternative fuels. We welcome the Bush administra-
tion’s  proposal  to  increase  the  renewable  fuels  mandate.  And  we  believe  that  the 
fuels carbon cap that was recently proposed by Governor Schwarzenegger represents 
a thoughtful approach that is worth examining on a Federal level. 
Vehicle Efficiency—Tax Incentives, CAFE, and Other Approaches 

In addition to pursuing measures to increase the use of alternative fuels in motor 
vehicles, the UAW believes that Congress should consider initiatives that will make 
vehicles  more  efficient,  and  reduce  their  consumption  of  oil  and  emission  of  green-
house gases. There are a number of possible approaches to achieve these objectives. 
A. Tax Incentives 

The  Federal  Government  currently  provides  tax  credits  to  consumers  who  pur-
chase  certain  advanced  technology  (hybrid,  diesel,  fuel  cell)  vehicles.  These  incen-
tives  are  designed  to  encourage  consumers  to  purchase  more  fuel-efficient  vehicles. 
However,  the  tax  credits  are  available  regardless  of  where  the  vehicles  and  their

90 

key  components  are  built.  They  are  not  tied  to  domestic  production.  Unfortunately, 
many  advanced  technology  vehicles  currently  are  assembled  in  other  nations.  Even 
worse,  virtually  all  of  the  key  components  (hybrid  electric  motors;  diesel  engines) 
for  these  vehicles  are  built  overseas,  including  the  key  components  for  vehicles  as-
sembled in this country, as well as those assembled in other countries. As these ad-
vanced  technology  vehicles  gain  a  larger  share  of  the  market,  this  means  we  are 
replacing vehicles with higher domestic content with vehicles that have much lower 
domestic  content.  As  a  result,  the  consumer  tax  credits  effectively  wind  up  sub-
sidizing  the  movement  of  automotive  jobs  overseas.  For  this  reason,  we  believe  it 
would  be  a  major  mistake  for  the  Federal  Government  to  rely  solely  on  these  con-
sumer tax credits to encourage the expansion of advanced technology vehicles. Cer-
tainly,  these  tax  credits  should  not  be  expanded  by  lifting  the  cap  on  the  number 
of qualifying vehicles. 

Some  persons  have  proposed  the  establishment  of  a  so-called  ‘‘fee  bate’’  system, 
under  which  the  Federal  Government  would  provide  tax  incentives  for  more  fuel- 
efficient  vehicles,  without  any  link  to  specific  technologies.  Because  most  of  these 
proposals  involve  a  tax  credit  for  the  consumer,  the  UAW  believes  they  suffer  from 
the same defect as the consumer tax credit for advanced technology vehicles. In the 
end,  this  could  subsidize  the  offshoring  of  automotive  production  and  jobs.  In  addi-
tion,  depending  on  how  any  ‘‘fee  bate’’  system  is  constructed,  it  could  have  a  nega-
tive impact on sales, production and jobs at particular companies. 

Instead of these flawed approaches, the UAW urges Congress to use tax and other 
incentives  to  encourage  domestic  production  of  advanced  technology  vehicles  and 
their  key  components.  As  was  demonstrated  by  a  November  2004  study  conducted 
by  the  Office  for  the  Study  of  Automotive  Transportation  (OSAT)  of  the  University 
of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, and commissioned by the bipartisan 
National  Commission  on  Energy  Policy,  this  type  of  approach  would  help  to  main-
tain  and  create  tens  of  thousands  of  automotive  jobs  in  this  country.  At  the  same 
time, it would help to accelerate the introduction of these advanced technology vehi-
cles,  and  thereby  reduce  global  warming  emissions  and  our  dependence  on  foreign 
oil. Moreover, in light of the highly competitive nature of the U.S. auto market, any 
savings  realized  by  the  auto  manufacturers  and  parts  companies  would  inevitably 
be  translated  into  cost  reductions  for  consumers,  and  thereby  encourage  sales  of 
these  more  efficient  vehicles.  Significantly,  the  OSAT  study  indicated  that  the  in-
creased  tax  revenues  for  Federal,  state  and  local  governments  generated  from  the 
jobs created for American workers would more than pay for the costs of such manu-
facturer incentives. 

The  UAW  was  pleased  that  this  type  of  proposal  for  a  manufacturer’s  tax  credit 
to  encourage  domestic  production  of  advanced  technology  vehicles  and  their  key 
components  was  included  in  a  number  bipartisan  bills  that  were  introduced  in  the 
last Congress. We urge this Committee to include this proposal in any energy legis-
lation that is considered the 110th Congress. 
B. CAFE 

The  Bush  administration  has  proposed  a  number  of  changes  in  the  CAFE  pro-
gram.  In  particular,  it  has  requested  the  authority  to  establish  an  attribute-based 
CAFE  system  for  passenger  cars,  similar  to  the  system  that  the  National  Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has already implemented for light trucks. In 
addition,  the  administration  has  proposed  that  auto  manufacturers  be  permitted  to 
trade  CAFE  credits.  It  has  also  proposed  that  NHTSA  be  prohibited  from  adopting 
any CAFE system based on a uniform percentage improvement (UPI) formula. 

The  UAW  recognizes  that  moving  to  an  attribute-based  CAFE  system  for  pas-
senger  cars  similar  to  the  system  for  light  trucks  would  have  the  benefit  of  elimi-
nating  the  discriminatory  impact  of  the  current  passenger  car  CAFE  rules  against 
full line producers. We would strongly applaud this development. The UAW has long 
complained  that  the  structure  of  the  current  passenger  car  CAFE  rules  does  not 
take  account  of  differences  in  the  product  mix  of  the  various  auto  manufacturers. 
As  a  result,  it  imposes  a  heavier,  unfair  burden  on  companies  that  have  a  product 
mix  more  oriented  toward  larger  passenger  cars.  Moving  to  an  attribute-based 
CAFE system for passenger cars would correct this problem, and require all compa-
nies to make similar efforts to improve fuel economy across their entire line of vehi-
cles. 

However, as the UAW indicated in our testimony on May 9, 2006 before the Sub-
committee  on  Surface  Transportation  and  Merchant  Marine  of  the  Senate  Com-
merce  Committee,  moving  to  an  attribute-based  CAFE  system  for  passenger  cars 
would also have the major down side of enabling auto manufacturers to offshore all 
of their small car production. Under the existing passenger car CAFE program, the 
combination  of  the  fleet  wide  averaging  and  the  two-fleet  (domestic  and  foreign)

91 

rules ensures that full line auto manufacturers must maintain small car production 
in  North  America.  This  is  because  the  production  of  smaller,  more  fuel  efficient  ve-
hicles is needed to offset the production of larger, less fuel efficient vehicles. 

As  a  matter  of  national  energy  policy,  the  UAW  believes  it  is  vital  that  the  U.S. 
retain domestic production of smaller, more fuel efficient passenger cars. As we have 
all  witnessed,  sharp  increases  in  gas  prices  can  lead  to  shifts  in  consumer  demand 
toward  smaller,  more  fuel  efficient  vehicles.  Unless  we  retain  domestic  production 
of such vehicles, consumers interested in this segment of the market could be forced 
to purchase foreign-made vehicles. 

Over  17,000  American  workers  are  currently  employed  in  seven  U.S.  assembly 
plants  that  produce  small  passenger  cars.  This  includes  GM,  Ford,  DCX,  and 
NUMMI  plants  in  Lordstown  (Ohio),  Spring  Hill  (Tennessee),  Wayne  (Michigan), 
Belvidere  (Illinois),  and  Fremont  (California).  Almost  50,000  American  workers 
produce parts for these vehicles. The jobs of these workers would be directly threat-
ened  by  any  CAFE  proposals  that  undermine  fleet  wide  averaging  and/or  the  two- 
fleet rule for passenger cars. The loss of these jobs would inevitably have a negative 
ripple effect on the rest of the economy. 

Some commentators have tried to dismiss concerns about the loss of small car pro-
duction by arguing that the companies will simply substitute large car or light truck 
production  at  these  facilities,  leaving  the  overall  production  and  employment  levels 
unchanged.  This  ignores  the  harsh  reality  that  there  currently  is  significant  over 
capacity  in  the  auto  industry.  The  real-world  impact  is  that  certain  companies 
would take advantage of any shift to an attribute-based CAFE system for passenger 
cars  to  further  downsize  their  operations  by  closing  their  small  car  facilities.  The 
net  result  is  that  tens  of  thousands  of  automotive  jobs  would  be  lost,  without  any 
compensating  replacements  with  large  vehicle  production  and  jobs.  Because  of  the 
high  multiplier  effect  of  auto  industry  employment,  this  also  would  lead  to  a  net 
loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in the overall economy. 

As the UAW testified last year, there is an easy way to obtain the benefits of mov-
ing to an attribute-based CAFE system for passenger cars, while avoiding the down 
side  of  losing  our  small  car  production  and  jobs.  Specifically,  the  UAW  urges  Con-
gress  to  impose  an  ‘‘anti-backsliding’’  requirement  on  any  new  CAFE  rules  that 
NHTSA  would  be  authorized  to  promulgate  for  passenger  cars.  This  requirement 
should specify that both the domestic and foreign passenger car fleets for each auto 
manufacturer would still have to meet or exceed the CAFE standard under the cur-
rent  system  (i.e.,  the  27.5  flat  MPG  fleet  wide  standard).  This  ‘‘anti-backsliding’’ 
benchmark should be increased in line with the overall fuel economy improvements 
required under any attribute-based passenger car CAFE system. 

The adoption of this type of ‘‘anti-backsliding’’ requirement would prevent compa-
nies  from  offshoring  all  of  their  small  car  production  and  jobs.  This  would  protect 
the  jobs  of  tens  of  thousands  of  American  workers,  and  guarantee  that  we  would 
continue  to  maintain  domestic  production  capacity  for  smaller,  more  fuel  efficient 
vehicles. 

This type of ‘‘anti-backsliding’’ requirement also would ensure that the auto man-
ufacturers  cannot  subvert  the  objective  of  any  new  CAFE  system  by  ‘‘up-sizing’’ 
many  of  their  vehicles,  resulting  in  worse  overall  fuel  economy.  It  would  guarantee 
that  the  companies  will  actually  improve  fuel  economy  across  the  entire  range  of 
their  passenger  cars,  and  that  consumers  and  our  Nation  will  indeed  receive  the 
benefits of more fuel efficient vehicles. 

The imposition of this type of ‘‘anti-backsliding’’ requirement would not be burden-
some  for  the  auto  manufacturers.  It  could  be  structured  in  a  manner  that  still  al-
lows  the  companies  to  obtain  the  benefits  of  moving  to  a  CAFE  system  that  takes 
into  account  product  mix  differences  between  the  companies.  If  the  companies  are 
genuinely  taking  steps  to  improve  fuel  economy  across  their  entire  range  of  pas-
senger  vehicles,  and  if  they  do  not  shift  small  car  production  overseas,  they  should 
easily be able to meet this requirement. 

Thus,  the  UAW  would  support  legislation  authorizing  NHTSA  to  establish  an  at-
tribute-based  CAFE  system  for  passenger  cars,  provided  this  is  coupled  with  an 
‘‘anti-backsliding’’  requirement  that  protects  small  car  production  and  jobs  in  this 
country.  If  this  type  of  ‘‘anti-backsliding’’  requirement  is  not  included,  then  we 
would vigorously oppose such legislation. 

The UAW believes that the establishment of a ‘‘credit trading’’ system that would 
allow  auto  manufacturers  to  buy  and  sell  CAFE  credits  for  passenger  cars  and/or 
trucks would also have the effect of undermining the two fleet rule and/or fleet wide 
averaging.  As  a  result,  it  would  inevitably  jeopardize  the  continuation  of  small  car 
production. It could also aggravate the uneven playing field that currently exists be-
tween  foreign  and  domestic  auto  manufacturers.  For  these  reasons,  we  oppose  the 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  08:33 Apr 16, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00095 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80088.TXT JACKIE

92 

proposals  put  forward  by  the  Administration  and  others  for  such  ‘‘credit  trading’’ 
systems. 

The  UAW  also  strongly  objects  to  the  administration’s  proposal  to  prohibit 
NHTSA  from  adopting  a  uniform  percentage  increase  (UPI)  approach  to  CAFE  im-
provements.  We  have  long  maintained  that  the  UPI  approach  would  be  the  fairest 
means of implementing fuel economy improvements. It would require all companies 
to  improve  the  fuel  economy  of  their  fleets.  At  the  same  time,  it  would  take  into 
account  existing  differences  between  the  companies  based  on  their  product  mixes. 
We find it particularly ironic that the administration would tout the administrative 
expertise of NHTSA in setting CAFE standards, while at the same time attempting 
to circumscribe their discretion and expertise by outlawing a UPI approach. 

One  of  the  key  issues  in  any  discussion  of  the  CAFE  program  is  the  stringency 
of  and  timeframe  for  any  proposed  increases  in  the  fuel  economy  standards.  In  his 
State of the Union address, President Bush estimated that the CAFE changes advo-
cated by the administration would save 8.5 billion gallons of gasoline by 2017. Back- 
up materials provided by the administration indicated that this assumes a 4 percent 
annual  increase  in  CAFE  standards  for  both  passenger  cars  and  light  trucks.  How-
ever, so far the administration has not produced any documents or analyses explain-
ing  the  basis  for  its  estimates  and  assumptions.  We  understand  that  NHTSA  has 
indicated that it does not have any basis for such projections. A number of Members 
of  Congress  have  also  put  forward  proposals  to  increase  CAFE  to  35  mpg  for  the 
combined passenger car and light truck fleets (S. 357), to 40 mpg for passenger cars 
(S. 183), or to require 4 percent annual increases in the CAFE standards. 

The UAW remains very skeptical about all of these proposals. We question wheth-
er  increases  of  this  magnitude  are  technologically  feasible.  In  our  view,  the  study 
by the National Academy of Sciences in 2002 does not support increases of this mag-
nitude. 

Even  more  importantly,  the  UAW  is  deeply  concerned  about  the  economic  feasi-
bility of these proposals. Specifically, in light of the extremely serious financial con-
ditions of GM, Ford and DCX, and the disparate burdens they face in retiree health 
care  legacy  costs  compared  to  their  competitors,  the  UAW  believes  that  the  imposi-
tion  of  CAFE  increases  of  this  magnitude  could  lead  to  calamitous  results.  This 
could  include  the  closing  of  additional  facilities  and  the  loss  of  tens  of  thousands 
of additional automotive jobs in this country. It could also include the loss of health 
coverage for 500,000 retired workers and their families. 

In the past 2 years, we have already seen these companies post shattering losses. 
In response, they have announced unprecedented plans to downsize their operations, 
involving  the  closing  of  numerous  automotive  facilities  and  buyout  programs  that 
could  result  in  the  loss  of  almost  90,000  jobs.  Meanwhile,  speculation  continues 
about  further  industry  restructuring  that  could  lead  to  more  plant  closings  and  job 
loss. 

The  difficulties  in  the  U.S.  automotive  industry  extend  beyond  GM,  Ford  and 
DCX.  Overall,  the  industry  has  lost  over  310,000  jobs  since  the  last  employment 
peak  in  February  2000.  These  losses  have  occurred  in  both  the  auto  parts  and  the 
assembly sectors. A number of parts companies have filed for bankruptcy, including 
Delphi.  In  addition  to  the  enormous  loss  of  jobs  in  the  auto  parts  sector,  there  has 
been tremendous downward pressure on the wages and benefits for the workers that 
remain. 

The  UAW  submits  that  any  consideration  of  CAFE  increases  must  take  into  ac-
count  the  terribly  difficult  and  precarious  financial  situation  for  a  large  part  of  the 
U.S.  automotive  industry.  Regardless  of  one’s  views  on  the  technological  feasibility 
of any CAFE increase, there is no dispute that meeting higher standards would nec-
essarily  entail  significant  retooling  costs  for  the  auto  manufacturers.  It  is  also  ap-
parent that there is not a level playing field among the companies in terms of their 
ability  to  shoulder  these  retooling  costs.  The  recent  profit/loss  situations  at  GM, 
Ford  and  DCX  are  very  different  than  Toyota  or  Honda.  In  addition,  because  they 
have  been  operating  for  a  long  period  of  time  and  have  many  retirees,  GM,  Ford 
and  DCX  have  very  substantial  retiree  health  legacy  costs.  In  contrast,  Toyota  and 
Honda  have  few  retirees  from  their  operations  in  this  country,  and  the  health  care 
costs from their Japanese facilities are heavily subsidized through a national health 
care system. 

Thus, the UAW believes that any proposals for CAFE increases must also include 
measures  that  will  help  to  level  the  playing  field  in  the  automotive  industry,  and 
provide struggling manufacturers with the resources needed for any retooling effort. 
Such assistance should be tied to investments in domestic production that will gen-
erate  jobs  for  American  workers  and  help  the  overall  U.S.  economy.  It  should  also 
be  structured  in  a  manner  that  recognizes  and  helps  to  address  the  fundamental 
imbalance in the auto industry related to retiree health care legacy costs.

The  Federal  Government  already  provides  substantial  subsidies  to  agri-business 
to  promote  alternative  fuels.  In  our  view,  it  makes  equal  sense  to  provide  com-
parable  assistance  to  the  auto  manufacturers  to  promote  greater  vehicle  efficiency. 
C. Other Approaches to Improving Vehicle Efficiency 

Rather than blindly turn to the CAFE program, the UAW urges Congress to also 
consider other mechanisms for improving vehicle efficiency that might be more con-
sistent  with  economy-wide  efforts  to  reduce  oil  consumption  and  greenhouse  gas 
emissions. For example, Congress should explore whether it would be better, in lieu 
of  increasing  CAFE  standards,  to  establish  carbon  reduction  or  oil  savings  require-
ments that each auto manufacturer would have to meet. Such approaches might be 
more  effective  in  achieving  these  desired  objectives,  and  might  also  avoid  some  of 
the  gaming  and  other  complications  that  have  plagued  the  CAFE  program.  These 
approaches  could  also  provide  a  mechanism  for  raising  the  revenue  that  would  be 
needed help struggling companies with retooling and retiree health legacy costs. The 
UAW  is  prepared  to  work  with  Congress  in  exploring  these  innovative  approaches. 
We recognize that any assistance to the auto manufacturers must be tied directly 
to measures that will guarantee public benefits through a reduction in carbon emis-
sions  and  oil  consumption  from  the  light  duty  automotive  fleet.  As  previously  indi-
cated,  we  also  believe  any  assistance  should  be  structured  in  a  manner  that  pro-
motes domestic production and jobs and protects retiree health care benefits. 

By structuring assistance in this manner, Congress can simultaneously achieve a 
number  of  critically  important  objectives.  It  can  require  auto  manufacturers  to 
produce  vehicles  that  are  more  efficient,  and  reduce  our  consumption  of  foreign  oil 
and emission of greenhouse gases. At the same time, it can create tens of thousands 
of  jobs  for  American  workers,  and  ensure  that  the  U.S.  will  be  producing  the  vehi-
cles  of  the  future.  It  can  also  help  to  foster  a  level  playing  field  in  the  automotive 
industry,  while  protecting  hard  earned  health  care  benefits  for  retirees  and  their 
families. 
Conclusion 

In  conclusion,  the  UAW  appreciates  the  opportunity  to  testify  before  the  Senate 
Commerce Committee at this oversight hearing on the CAFE program. We look for-
ward  to  working  with  this  Committee  in  fashioning  measures  that  will  enable  the 
U.S. to make progress in addressing the climate change and energy security issues, 
while protecting jobs and benefits for American workers and retirees. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Reuther. 
Let  me  start  with  you,  if  I  may,  Mr.  Reuther,  just  for  point  of 

clarification. Do you oppose higher CAFE standards? 

Mr.  REUTHER.  No.  We  think  the  CAFE  program  could  be  in-
creased,  but  we  think,  at  the  same  time  that  is  being  done,  that 
the Federal Government should help provide the—— 

Senator PRYOR. Right. 
Mr.  REUTHER.—resources  to  the  struggling  manufacturers,  and 

help to provide a level playing field in the industry. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Right.  And  do  you  believe  that  Congress  should 
set  the  target  or  the  goal,  or  do  you  think  we  should  leave  that  to 
NHTSA’s discretion? 

Mr.  REUTHER.  We’re  agnostic  on  that  issue.  We  supported  the 
original  CAFE  law,  when  Congress  set  the  standard.  We’ve  sup-
ported  NHTSA  in  their  light  truck  standard.  We  think  the  real 
issue  is,  what  is  the  standard  that  we’re  talking  about—not  who 
is going to be deciding it. 

Senator  PRYOR.  And  you  mentioned  a  level  playing  field.  Do 
you—is  that,  in  your  mind,  a  difference  in  domestically  produced 
autos and foreign produced autos? Tell me what you mean by ‘‘level 
playing field.’’ 

Mr.  REUTHER.  Well,  it  refers  to  two  things.  One,  that  there’s  ob-
viously  a  very  great  different  right  now  in  the  financial  conditions 
of GM, Ford, and DaimlerChrysler, compared to Toyota and Honda. 
That  affects  the  ability  of  the  companies  to  afford  the  retooling 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  08:33 Apr 16, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00097 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\80088.TXT JACKIE

94 

costs. Also, underlying that, there’s a huge imbalance in the indus-
try,  in  terms  of  the  retiree  health  care  burdens.  GM,  Ford,  and 
DaimlerChrysler,  because  they’ve  been  in  operation  so  long,  have 
hundreds  of  thousands  of  retirees  that  they’re  paying  health  care 
for.  Toyota  of  America,  Honda  of  America,  have  virtually  no  retir-
ees.  At  their  facilities  in  Japan,  those  health  care  costs  are  sub-
sidized  by  national  health  care  systems.  So,  you  have  this  funda-
mental  imbalance  in  health  care  burdens,  and  that  will  impact  on 
the ability of the companies to afford the retooling costs. 

Senator  PRYOR.  And  are  you  saying  that  CAFE  factors  into  the 

automakers decision on where they build their vehicles? 

Mr.  REUTHER.  If  there  was  a  move  toward  an  attributed-based 
passenger  car  system,  if  that  is  not  coupled  with  an  anti-back-
sliding  rule,  we  will  see  the  loss  of  all  the  domestic  small  car  pro-
duction,  and  the  parts  production  that  goes  into  that.  That  would 
be  a  very  significant  job  loss  for  this  country.  So,  we  think  some 
mechanism, such as an anti-backsliding rule, should be included to 
prevent that result. 

Senator  PRYOR.  All  right.  Connect  those  dots  for  me.  Why 
would—if  we  don’t  have  the  anti-backsliding—which,  by  the  way, 
I’m  not  necessarily  opposed  to—but  if  we  don’t  have  that,  why  do 
our  domestic  manufacturers  of  small  cars  go  away?  Why  is  that? 
Mr.  REUTHER.  Right  now,  the  current  CAFE  structure  is  a 
fleetwide  average  and  a  two-fleet  requirement.  You  have  to  meet 
the  fleetwide  average  for  your  domestic  fleet,  and  meet  it  sepa-
rately  for  your  foreign  fleet.  Anything  that  changes  either  the 
fleetwide  average  requirement  or  the  two  fleet  requirement  would 
jeopardize small car production. Right now, companies have to keep 
small car production in this country to balance out the bigger cars 
that they produce here. Moving to an attributed-based system gets 
rid  of  the  fleetwide  average  requirement.  Companies  would,  there-
fore, no longer have to keep the small cars here to balance out the 
larger ones they produce here. 

Senator PRYOR. OK. 
Now  I  have  questions  for  the  two  scientists.  First,  I’d  just  like 
to get your general impressions of NHTSA. And the reason I’m ask-
ing  this  is,  I  think  there’s  a  suspicion,  in  some  quarters  at  least, 
that NHTSA, under this administration, is very reluctant to be ag-
gressive  on  new  CAFE  standards.  And  I  would  like  to  hear  from 
the  two  scientists  your  impressions.  I  know  you’re  not  tied  to 
NHTSA  in  any  way,  and  you  deal  in  this  world  a  lot.  So,  Dr. 
Greene, do you want to just take that? 

Dr.  GREENE.  Well,  I  think  my  answer  is,  sort  of,  ‘‘on  the  one 
hand/on the other hand,’’ I’m afraid. NHTSA has, of its own initia-
tive,  raised  the  light  truck  fuel  economy  standards  twice.  That’s 
more  than  happened  previously,  when  they  were  not  allowed  to 
even  enter  into  rulemakings.  So,  they  have  shown  some  initiative. 
But  I  think,  as  we  saw  in  the  first  panel’s  discussion,  a  bureau-
cratic agency has a great deal of difficulty in deciding on the values 
of  things.  And,  in  particular,  our  discussion  this  morning  focused 
on the value of greenhouse gas emissions. And I think the criticism 
was absolutely justified, that there—you cannot assign a zero value 
to  increasing  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  But  I  think  what  we  saw 
is  that,  in  the  face  of  great  uncertainty,  this  was  exactly  the  solu-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  08:33 Apr 16, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00098 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\80088.TXT JACKIE

95 

tion  that  the  agency  decided  on.  To  do  something  else  is  to  stick 
your  neck  out,  in  a  sense,  and  say,  ‘‘Well,  I  think  it’s  $25  a  ton  of 
CO2.’’ And then someone will criticize you for that. I think we could 
have  had  the  same  discussion  around  the  national  defense—the 
foreign  policy  values  of  reducing  oil  dependence,  where,  similarly, 
essentially, there was no value given. So, I think this poses a very 
difficult  problem  for  an  administrative  agency  to  decide  on  these 
values. And my view would be that, if the Congress does not, itself, 
want  to  set  a  specific  fuel  economy  target,  then  the  Congress  will 
need  to  give  very  strong  guidance  to  an  administrative  agency 
about  the  values  of  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  the 
value it attaches to reducing oil dependence. 

Senator PRYOR. Mr. Friedman? 
Mr. FRIEDMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  think  that  NHTSA  has  strengths  and  weaknesses  when  it 
comes  to  dealing  with  fuel  economy  standards.  I  think  one  place 
that  is—one  job  that’s  appropriate,  and  very  appropriate  for 
NHTSA, is to figure out the details once Congress sets a target, of 
how  to  get  there;  what  the  structure  should  look  like,  how  to  bal-
ance  differences  between  manufacturers,  based  on  product  plans 
that  they  can  get  from  those  automakers.  However,  Congress  is 
best  situated  both  to  really  translate  the  concerns  and  the  will  of 
the  American  people,  in  terms  of  how  much  to  value  these  impor-
tant  issues,  such  as  climate  change  and  global  warming  pollution, 
not  to  mention  the  significant  lack  of  choice  consumers  face  in  the 
marketplace today. 

Congress has the ability, and has called, for example, on the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences, to provide them with guidance to make 
sure  that  they  can  set  a  standard  that  is  not  arbitrary,  that  is,  in 
fact, based in science and based on how far the technologies can go. 
Once Congress sets this goal, as it did in 1975, NHTSA is definitely 
a  good  place  to  figure  out  exactly  how  to  get  there,  between  what 
mix  of  vehicles,  what  mix  of  standards,  and  what  are  the  appro-
priate rules. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Well,  Mr.  Friedman,  it  sounds  like  you’re  com-
fortable with the National Academy of Sciences and their ability to 
come up with science-based findings. Is that fair to say? 

Mr.  FRIEDMAN.  I  think  that  in  evaluating  the  technological  po-
tential, the previous National Academy of Sciences panel did a very 
good  job.  If  you  look  at  the  fleet  that  could  be  made  from  all  the 
technologies in that report, it could reach up to 37 miles per gallon 
based on the fleet mix they analyzed. That has changed a little bit 
over  time,  but  I  think  that  is  very  clear  and  very  useful  input  to 
Congress  so  that  they  can  avoid  making  any  arbitrary  standards. 
I  would  argue  they  were  actually  conservative,  and,  maybe  with 
updating that analysis, they will go even farther. 

Senator PRYOR. Getting back to NHTSA just for a second, do you 
believe  that  NHTSA  has  the  capability  in-house  to  analyze  all  the 
data,  whether  it  be  from  NAS  or  from  the  auto  manufacturers  or 
whatever,  and  pull  that  together  and  come  up  with  the  right  kind 
of CAFE standards? 

Mr.  FRIEDMAN.  I  think  that,  historically,  NHTSA  was  starved  of 
staff  and  of  funding.  I  think  that  has  started  to  change.  But  I  do 
think there is a role for increased funding for NHTSA so that there

can  be  additional  staff  to  help  analyze  these  problems.  But,  as  Dr. 
Greene  said,  at  the  end  of  the  day  there  are  some  questions 
NHTSA cannot answer, and that is the role of Congress. 

Senator PRYOR. Dr. Greene, do you have a comment? 
Dr. GREENE. I would like to add one more thing. I think, histori-
cally,  we  can  see  that  NHTSA  has  set  standards  over  a  relatively 
short  time  period  into  the  future.  And  this  is  also  true  with  the 
standards they just recently set for light trucks. This is—they don’t 
look  10,  12,  15  years  ahead.  And  I  think  that  prevents  them  from 
setting  a  higher  level  of  standard  in  the  future,  because,  as  Mr. 
Stricker  pointed  out,  it  takes  time  for  the  manufacturers  to  rede-
sign  all  of  their  product  lines.  And  so,  this  is,  I  think,  a  reflection 
of  the  difficulty  of  dealing  with  risk.  It’s  hard  to  look  very  far  into 
the future. There are market risks, there are technology risks, and 
so  on.  And  I  think  NHTSA  has  had  a  difficulty  in,  let’s  say,  being 
bold  enough  to  set  standards  for  a  decade  or  more  in  the  future. 
Senator  PRYOR.  Dr.  Greene,  let  me  ask  one  last  question  to  you 
about  greenhouse  gases.  We’ve  talked  about  how,  when  NHTSA 
looks at it, there’s a value of zero. I think most people would think 
that  when  reducing  greenhouses  gases,  there  ought  to  be  some 
value  attached.  But  how  does  that  factor  into  a  CAFE  standard? 
How would you quantify a reduction in greenhouse gases? And how 
does  that  work  into  the  formula  or  become  a  credit  in  the  CAFE 
world? 

Dr.  GREENE.  Right.  As—NHTSA  did  this  in  much  the  same  way 
that the National Academies did, they looked at the marginal costs 
of improving fuel economy and the marginal benefits. So, the mar-
ginal  costs  are  essentially  the  costs  of  the  technologies  that  must 
be  added.  And  they  try  to  find  a  level  at  which  the  last  increment 
of  cost  and  fuel  economy  is  equal  to  the  value  of  the  fuel  saved. 
Well, part of the value of the fuel saved is the actual price you pay 
for  the  fuel  minus  the  taxes,  because  the  tax  would  be  a  transfer 
payment.  Then  they  have  to  add,  on  top  of  that,  the  social  value. 
And that’s where we get into difficulty. What is the social value of 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions? What is the social value of re-
ducing  oil  dependence?  And  there’s  a  great  deal  of  uncertainty 
about  those.  And  so,  they  have  to  come  up  with  some  number.  Is 
it  25  cents  a  gallon  that’s  the  social  value  of  reducing  greenhouse 
gas  emissions  and  oil  dependence,  or  is  it  50  cents  a  gallon?  And 
this can make quite a bit of different in determining where you set 
the level of fuel economy. 

yes. 

Senator PRYOR. Dr. Greene, you have a number on that? 
Dr.  GREENE.  Do  I  have  a—it’s  like  the  joke,  I  have  lots  of  them, 

Senator PRYOR. OK. But you don’t see a—sort of a recognized or 
a  consensus  number  out  there  where  you  think  it  ought  to  be  set? 
Dr.  GREENE.  I  think—in  the  case  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions, 
you  heard  that  it  might  be  $25  a  ton  of  CO2,  it  might  $100  a  ton 
of  CO2,  and  that’s  likely  to  change  over  time,  as  well.  I  think  the 
problem  is,  what  exactly  is  going  to  happen  as  a  result  of  climate 
change?  And  there’s  still  great  uncertainty  about  that.  And  so,  it’s 
very difficult for a scientist to tell you what exactly is the value of 
reducing a ton of carbon dioxide.

On the national defense side, it’s extremely controversial, for ex-
ample, to say, ‘‘Well, this much of our military budget, or this much 
of  our  expenses  on  national  defense,  or  due  to  our  dependence  on 
oil.’’  It’s  extremely  difficult,  technically,  and  highly  controversial. 
And  so,  there,  you  know,  you  just  can’t  find—I  mean,  people  have 
tried to do it, but there is no consensus. 

Senator  PRYOR.  OK.  And  that  makes  it  understandable  why 
NHTSA has not been able to—or not willing, at least, to set a num-
ber. 

Mr.  FRIEDMAN.  Senator,  I  just  wanted  to  make  two  more  com-
ments,  because  I  think  this  discussion  of  global-warming  pollution 
is  extremely  important.  I  think  one  of  the  things  that  we  have  to 
remember—as  Dr.  Greene  said,  there  is  a  lot  of  uncertainty  here 
with  global-warming  pollution,  but  we  know  it’s—we  know  global- 
warming pollution is there, we know humans are causing this prob-
lem.  And  what  we’ve  also  found,  from  scientists’  findings  over  the 
last  several  years,  is,  each  time  we  think  that  we’ve  figured  out 
how bad the problem is, the science usually tells us it’s worse. Gla-
ciers are melting quicker than we thought, tropical diseases are po-
tentially  moving  quicker  than  we  thought  as  a  result.  So,  I  would 
argue, at a minimum, for a precautionary principle, when it comes 
to global-warming pollution, when we look at these numbers. 

I would also add that—Dr. Greene talked about costs, maybe $25 
or  $50  per  ton  of  carbon  dioxide.  This  really  points  out  one  of  the 
challenges  with  addressing  car  and  truck  pollution  from  cap-and- 
trade  systems.  UCS  strongly  supports  cap-and-trade  systems  for 
the  entire  economy.  But  if  carbon  dioxide  is  valued  at  $25  to  $50 
per  ton,  you’re  talking  about  effectively  increasing  gasoline  prices 
by  tens  of  cents,  maybe  half  a  dollar,  on  the  more  extreme.  If  we 
look  at  what’s  happened  over  the  past  several  years,  gas  prices 
have  more  than  doubled,  at  times,  and  we’ve  seen  very  little  re-
sponse  from  consumers.  We  cannot  expect  a  cap-and-trade  system, 
an economy-wide cap-and-trade system, to adequately deal with the 
global-warming  pollution  from  our  cars  and  trucks.  This  is  where 
something  like  a  national  system  to  control  that  global-warming 
pollution from those vehicles, or CAFE standards, has to come into 
play.  We  do  need  an  economywide  cap-and-trade  system,  but  it’s 
not going to effectively deal with our cars and trucks. 

Senator  PRYOR.  I’d  like  to  hear,  very  quickly  from  General  Mo-
tors and Toyota, about whether they think a greenhouse gas emis-
sions factor should be included in CAFE standards. Do you all have 
a  position  on  whether  you  should  factor  in  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions when you’re looking at CAFE? 

Ms. LOWERY. Either one of us can go first. 
I  mean,  CAFE  standards  regulate  CO2 now.  I  mean,  basically 
that’s  what  you’re  doing,  you’re  having  fuel  economy  regulated 
through  CAFE.  So,  I’m  not  exactly  sure,  with  respect  to  the  ques-
tion,  other  than  you’re  asking,  what  would  the  value  be  if  you  do 
the  cost-benefit  analysis?  And,  I  think,  as  people  have  noted,  it’s 
very  uncertain  what  that  value  is.  And  I  think  there  needs  to  be 
more research and more work done in that area. 

Senator PRYOR. Toyota? 
Mr. STRICKER. I think I would probably agree and echo what Ms. 
Lowery said. I—you know, not being an economist, myself, I’m not

sure  exactly  how  you  value  the  various  different  kinds  of 
externalities, such as Dr. Greene mentioned, in terms of energy se-
curity  or  CO2,  et  cetera.  And—at  the  end  of  the  day,  though,  I 
think  that,  no  matter  what,  if  such  a  factor  were  included,  it 
doesn’t  change  the  sort  of  fundamental  pace  of  technology,  and 
progress  that  we  can  make  in  technology,  to  put  on  the  vehicle 
side. 

Senator PRYOR. OK. 
We’ve been joined by Senator Thune. 
Senator Thune? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA 

Senator THUNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is down to you and 

me. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  THUNE.  I’m  sorry  I  missed—I’ve  had  three  hearings 
going at the same time today. But I appreciate the panels and their 
testimonies and their patience. 

Just  a  couple  of  questions,  if  I  could,  fairly  quickly  here.  And 
maybe this is direct and I know we have a couple of panelists who 
are  from  the  scientific  community,  but  what  do  you  think  the  goal 
of  the  CAFE  program  should  be?  Should  it  be  to  reduce  U.S.  oil 
consumption? Should it be used to reduce U.S. consumption of for-
eign sources of oil? Should it be used to reduce greenhouse gas pro-
duction?  Should  there  be  some  other  goal?  I  guess  my  question  is, 
what  do  you  see  as  the  overriding  goal  of  CAFE  standards?  Any-
body want to take a stab at that? 

Mr. FRIEDMAN. You want to go first, David? I’ll follow up. 
Dr.  GREENE.  I  think  there  are,  chiefly,  three  goals,  and  you’ve 
stated  two  of  them.  One  is  to  reduce  dependence  on  oil.  But  de-
pendence  on  oil,  of  course,  goes  beyond  light-duty  vehicles.  And  it 
goes beyond fuel economy, as Ms. Lowery has pointed out, to alter-
native  fuels.  So,  in  that  sense,  CAFE  is  a  part  of  a  comprehensive 
strategy, but not the whole strategy, in and of itself. And it’s prob-
ably the most important part of a comprehensive strategy. 

Also, CAFE helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and that’s 
an  important  goal.  And,  I  think,  finally,  we  haven’t  talked  about 
it much, but we are nearing the point where we will begin to make 
a  transition—and,  in  fact,  in  some  senses,  we  already  have  begun 
to make a transition from conventional oil to alternative sources of 
energy  for  transportation.  These  might  be  oil  sands,  heavy  oil,  oil 
shale, coal to liquids, gas to liquids, something like that. But as the 
countries  outside  of  OPEC  find  it  more  and  more  difficult  to  in-
crease oil production in order to meet increasing mobility demands 
for  the  world,  we’re  going  to  bring  on  other  fuels.  I  think  that 
CAFE also helps us postpone that—slow down that process of tran-
sition, because the choices we make are going to be choices that re-
main with us for a long time, and if we choose to go to high carbon 
sources,  like  coal  to  liquids,  like  oil  sands  and  oil  shale,  then  we 
have a very serious problem of how to mitigate those carbon emis-
sions. 

Senator THUNE. Mr. Friedman?

Mr.  FRIEDMAN.  In  general,  I  would  agree  with  what  Dr.  Greene 
said. Originally, of course, fuel economy standards were focused on 
reducing  our  oil  addiction.  And  they  have  clearly  had  that  impact. 
If we—if our cars and trucks were stuck at the fuel economy levels 
they  were  back  in  the  1970s,  we  would  be  consuming  50  to  80  bil-
lion  gallons  of  additional  gasoline.  That’s  hundreds  of  billions  of 
dollars that consumers would be paying today if we didn’t have the 
CAFE standards we have right now. 

Of  course,  if  those  standards  had  continued  to  increase,  con-
sumers would be saving a lot more money. So, I would argue, defi-
nitely fuel economy standards should have as a goal reducing total 
oil  consumption,  because  whether  you’re  reducing  imports  or  do-
mestic  oil  use,  you’re  reducing  the  impacts  that  our  oil  addiction 
will have on our economy and our environment. 

Fuel  economy  standards  will  definitely  help  reduce  global-warm-
ing pollution, but, as Dr. Greene said, you also need fuel standards, 
cleaner fuel standards in order to deal with that, as well as finding 
ways to get consumers to reduce their amount of travel. 

And  finally,  fuel  economy  standards  can  save  consumers  money. 
That is one of the most impressive things about these technologies. 
It’s  an  investment  up  front,  by  both  the  automakers  and  by  con-
sumers,  but,  at  the  end  of  the  day,  consumers  are  going  to  save 
thousands  of  dollars  on  gasoline.  And  if  you’re  not  sending  that 
money to—exported to other countries, it’s being spent here in this 
country,  it’s  creating  new  jobs,  it’s  helping  the  auto  industry,  and 
it’s helping consumers. 

Senator THUNE. I appreciate the fact that it has been reduced in 
terms of billions of gallons. I don’t like the fact that 30 years later 
we’re still at 60 percent—I remember as a kid when I was growing 
up  in  the  1970s,  and  we  had  the  gas  lines  and  the  gas  wars,  and 
everybody  said,  ‘‘We’ve  got  to  get  less  dependent  upon  foreign  en-
ergy,’’ and, at that time, we were about 50 percent dependent upon 
foreign  energy,  and  today  we’re  still  getting  60  percent.  Now,  that 
being  said,  of  course,  the  economy’s  grown  dramatically,  and  obvi-
ously on a relative scale or level, we still have an awful long ways 
to go to get away from energy dependence. I know that this is just 
one  component  part  of  that.  And  there  are  lots  of  other  things  we 
need  to  be  doing,  including  shifting  away  from  some  of  our  tradi-
tional  historic  energy  sources  toward  renewables  and  alternative 
energy sources. 

And that’s what I want an answer for—I guess, for the car man-
ufacturers  who  are  here.  There  have  been  some  who  have  raised 
the  concern  about  the  1.2  mile  per  gallon  CAFE  credit  that  auto-
makers receive for selling flex-fuel vehicles, arguing that the credit 
doesn’t  help  decrease  oil  consumption,  because  too  many  flex-fuel 
vehicles  are  purchased  in  areas  with  little  or  no  E85  availability, 
and, therefore, never run on anything but unleaded gasoline. Now, 
that’s a problem with our infrastructure. And I’ve—as many of you 
know,  have  introduced  legislation,  along  with  Senator  Salazar,  to 
try  to  help  solve  that  infrastructure  problem.  I  guess  the  basic 
question is, do you agree that our E85 infrastructure and other al-
ternative  fuel  infrastructures  need  to  be  strengthened?  And,  sec-
ond,  does  the  bill  I’ve  introduced  with  Senator  Salazar  take  us  in 
the right direction?

Ms. LOWERY. Thank you, Senator. 
I do think it’s very important that we focus on the infrastructure. 
So,  with  respect  to  the  E85  flex-fuel  credit  for  vehicles,  my  view, 
and  the  company’s  view,  is  that  the  incentive  worked.  We  have 
more than 6 million vehicles on the road today as an industry that 
can  run  on  flex  fuels.  And  so,  what  needs  to  happen  is,  we  need 
to have incentives for the infrastructure. We think it’s very impor-
tant that we do have this integrated approach. So, while we’ve had 
a  lot  of  discussion  today  about  fuel  economy,  that  is  a  piece  of  it, 
it  certainly  is  not  the  whole  answer,  and  we  need  to  make  sure 
that  we  talk  about  the  fuel  piece,  the  consumer  piece,  and  defi-
nitely,  on  flex  fuels,  the  infrastructure  piece.  GM  alone  has  more 
than  2  million  vehicles  on  the  road  that  run  on  flex  fuels.  We  also 
have  worked  in  13  different  states,  and  will  have  more  coming, 
where you put together partnerships to help that infrastructure, to 
take  advantage  of  some  of  the  incentives  that  were  passed  in  the 
energy  bill  and  other  incentives  that  could  be  in  the  marketplace. 
But we need to get the fuels to the customers. 

Senator THUNE. Mr. Stricker? 
Mr. STRICKER. Yes, thank you, Senator. 
Toyota  does  not  yet,  in  the  U.S.,  make  a  flexible-fueled  vehicle. 
We’ve announced plans for our Toyota Tundra V8 model to be flexi-
ble-fuel  in  late  2008  as  a  2009  model  year  vehicle.  Clearly,  as  Ms. 
Lowery  said,  the  flexible-fuel  vehicle  credit  appears  to  have  been 
very effective in getting FFVs into the market. And clearly, as she 
said,  as  well,  the  challenge  is  really  to  get  the  fuels  out  there  into 
the  market.  That’s  one  of  the  reasons  that  we  haven’t  been  in  the 
market  up  to  this  point,  is  that  there  really  hasn’t  been  a  market, 
so to speak. 

But,  in  addition  to  expanding  the  infrastructure,  which,  of 
course,  would  be  necessary  to  expand  the  volume  of  fuel,  the—we 
think  one  of  the  other  real  challenges  is  to  increase  the  volume  of 
alternative  fuels  that  are  available  in  the  marketplace.  And  to  do 
that, we probably need to move beyond current production methods 
for some of these alternative fuels. There is really—we’re not agri-
cultural folks, but our understanding, based on a lot of studies and 
a  lot  of  discussion  with  folks,  is  that,  with  the  current  production 
methods, maybe 15 billion gallons of ethanol a year might be a fea-
sible  number—some  are  higher  estimates,  some  are  a  little  bit 
lower—that  we  can  get  from  current  sources  of  production.  And 
with  a  large  volume  of  ethanol  going  toward  E10  blending,  basi-
cally  gasohol,  not  E85,  there’s  but  so  much  additional  ethanol 
available that can go into fueling an E85 fleet. So, really we think 
that  one  of  the  key  challenges  to  making  the  E85  equation  work 
long term is to move toward some sort of cellulosic process, or even 
other  kinds  of  biofuels,  that  can  extend  and  expand  the  volume  of 
these  fuels  that  would  be  available.  And,  of  course,  they’re  going 
to  have  to  be  cost-competitive  with  gasoline  on  a  per-mile  basis. 
That’s  a  big  challenge.  And  I  think  a  lot  of  research  still  needs  to 
be done in that area. 

Senator  THUNE.  Well,  and  that’s  happening.  The  transition  from 
corn-based  to  cellulosic  is  from  other  biomass  materials  already 
taking  place.  And  so,  I  think  and  I  hope  that  your  company  will 
begin to manufacture flex-fuel vehicles, and that, when you do, you

will  get  an  interest  in  agriculture,  and  that  I’m  sure  you  all  will 
want to endorse the Thune-Salazar refueling station bill when that 
happens, as well. 

But  I  do  think  these  are  all  things  that  have  to  be  married  up. 
You’ve got the production side of this, and, in my state, you know, 
we’ve  got  11  ethanol  plants,  five  under  construction.  We’ll,  by  the 
year 2008, be producing about a billion gallons of ethanol in South 
Dakota  alone,  and  we  stand,  I  think,  positioned  well  for  the  next 
wave of that, which is making it out of switchgrass or bluestem or 
cornstover.  But,  that  being  said,  I  don’t  think  we  can  do  enough. 
And  I  was  glad  to  see  the  President  in  his  State  of  the  Union  ad-
dress, set that goal out there at 35 billion gallons by the year 2017. 
That’s  very  ambitious.  But  I  think  that  we  can  get  there  although 
it  is  going  to  take  a  concerted  effort.  And  I  know  that  we’re  going 
to need to have the infrastructure, we’re going to need to have the 
market, obviously, and we’re going to have to have the production. 
And all these things have to come together. But it’s the right direc-
tion, in my view, to go. And so, I encourage your continued support 
and willingness to work with us as we try to achieve that goal. 

Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. 
Senator PRYOR. Thank you. 
Senator THUNE. Thank the witnesses. 
Senator PRYOR. Thank you for your joining us. 
I  really  just  have  a  couple  more  questions,  really  for  the  auto 
manufacturers.  And  I  know  we’ve  gone  much  longer  than  we 
thought  we  would,  but  it’s  been  a  good  hearing,  and  very  inter-
esting and informative. 

I have a couple of questions, about batteries, for the auto manu-
facturers.  There  was  a  brief  mention—I  believe  it  was  by  the 
NHTSA  Administrator  today—that  maybe  the  batteries  catch  fire. 
You  know,  I’ve  heard  that  here  and  there.  I  know  most  of  these 
batteries,  if  not  all  of  them,  are  not  manufactured  in  the  U.S., 
they’re  manufactured  overseas.  Is  there  a  problem  with  current 
battery  technology?  I  think  Senator  Carper,  if  I  recall,  mentioned 
allocating  more  dollars  in  the  budget  to  do  battery  research.  What 
is the challenge with battery technology? Toyota, can—— 

Mr. STRICKER. OK, certainly, thank you. 
Let  me  just  make  one  point  clear  at  the  outset,  is  that  there  is 
not  a  concern  with  fire  in  current  hybrid  vehicles  that  are  on  the 
road, in the battery technology. The batteries that are currently out 
there are nickel-metal-hydride batteries. The—I think the reference 
to  fires  was  in  regards  to  some  of  the  consumer  electronics  issues 
that  have  cropped  recently  with  lithium-ion  batteries.  And,  grant-
ed,  the  future  wave  for  battery  technology  in  vehicles  may  very 
well  be  lithium-ion  technology,  as  well.  There  are  different  chem-
istries  that  you  can  use  to  deal  with  thermal  management  issues, 
which is how we refer to them. 

But  the  challenge  with  plug-in  hybrid  vehicles,  electric  vehicles, 
is,  indeed,  the  battery.  That’s  the  A-number-1  obstacle  right  now 
in  getting  that  kind  of  vehicle  into  market.  The  current—on  the 
current Prius, with a nickel-metal-hydride battery, we have to keep 
the  state  of  charge—you  know,  we  can’t  have  a  completely  dis-
charged  battery  or  a  completely  full  battery—we  have  to  maintain 
the  state  of  charge  of  that  battery  in  a  very  narrow  range  of  per-

haps 70 to 90 percent state of charge. You can’t charge the battery 
all  the  way  up,  and  you  can’t  discharge  it  all  the  way  down,  like 
we all do with our BlackBerrys and our cell phones. That damages 
the  battery  very  quickly.  And,  you  know,  you  have  big  warranty 
problems then. So, basically, we have to manage the state of charge 
of the battery in a very narrow window. So, you can’t use that kind 
of battery technology, let’s say, on a plug-in type application, where 
you  want  a  much  longer  range  of  operation,  let’s  say,  without  the 
internal  combustion  engine  charging  the  battery.  So,  we  have  to 
move to a different kind of battery technology. 

When  you  have  lithium-ion  batteries,  you  can  have  a  much 
broader  range  of  state  of  charge  of  the  battery,  and  you  also  are 
able to determine the state of charge of the battery much more eas-
ily  with  a—the  current  nickel-metal-hydride  batteries,  one  of  the 
other  reasons  we  have  to  keep  the  state  of  charge  narrow  is  that, 
just because of the battery technology, it’s difficult to tell what the 
state  of  charge  is.  So,  we  have  to  narrow  it  even  further.  With  a 
lithium-ion  battery,  it’s  much  easier  to  tell  what  the  charge  of  the 
battery is, and you can charge and discharge it further. 

But  to  move  into  plug-in  applications,  much  more  work  is  going 
to  need  to  be  done.  First,  we  have  to  get  to  lithium-ion.  Then  we 
have to be able to increase the capacity, the energy output, reduce 
the  cost  and  the  size  of  the  battery.  You  know,  it  has  to  be  able 
to fit in the back of the vehicle. 

Do you want to add something? 
Ms. LOWERY. No, I agree with those challenges. I also agree that 
every  product  we  put  on  the  road  would  not  have  any  issue  with 
respect  to  thermal-management  issues,  as  raised  from  a  battery 
standpoint. 

We  certainly  are  working  hard.  We  have  a  couple  of  codevelop-
ment  agreements  with  some  battery  companies  to  get  to  the  next 
level of lithium-ion batteries, because we do believe that electrifica-
tion  of  the  vehicle,  the  plug-in  hybrids,  eventually  fuel  cells,  all 
that’s  very  important.  The  reference  was  the  fact  that  there  isn’t 
any  battery  manufacturing  technology  here  in  the  U.S.,  and  also, 
we  could  have  more  funding  from  the  U.S.  Government  with  re-
spect to the research and development for that technology for auto-
motive  application.  So,  lithium-ion  batteries  are  in  wide  applica-
tions, but not for automotive, at this point in time. 

Senator PRYOR. Right. Ms. Lowery, let me ask, would one advan-

tage of lithium-ion maybe be that it’s lighter? Does that help? 

Ms. LOWERY. With respect to—well, go ahead. 
Mr.  STRICKER.  It  helps.  You—what  you  can  do  is,  you  can  get 

more—you can get more charge—— 

Senator PRYOR. Work or—— 
Mr. STRICKER.—out of the batteries, so—— 
Senator PRYOR. Yes, pound or whatever. 
Mr.  STRICKER.—to  get  the  equivalent  amount  of  work,  you  don’t 

need a battery that’s the same—— 

Senator PRYOR. Right. 
Mr. STRICKER.—size. You can have a smaller battery. 
Senator  PRYOR.  Lighter.  And  is  there  an  environmental  hazard 

with either the manufacturer or the disposal of these batteries?

Mr.  STRICKER.  No.  The—there  are—you  know,  every  manufac-
turing  process  has  its  own  challenges.  One  of  the  issues  with  bat-
teries,  of  course,  is  we  need  a  system  for  recycling  the  batteries. 
We’ve  set  up  such  a  system  for  the  nickel-metal-hydride  batteries 
in  the  current  Toyota  and  Lexus  hybrid  products,  and  generally 
that’s  a  recycling  program  that’s  put  in  place  for  when  there  are 
accidents and the vehicle is totaled or whatever, and you have this 
extra  battery  sitting  there.  We  have  not  run  into  situations  where 
people’s batteries have just stopped working, you know, from a du-
rability  perspective,  so  we’re  not  recycling  batteries,  for  that  rea-
son, but mainly from when they’re in an accident. 

Ms.  LOWERY.  I  would  say  that  all  those  issues  are  manageable, 
so,  just  like  we  would—with  the  lead  acid  batteries,  came  up  with 
a  system  for  recycling,  then—and  nickel-metal-hydride—I’m  sure, 
with  lithium-ion,  as  that—technologies  develop  for  automotive  ap-
plication, we’ll deal with those issues, as well. 

Senator  PRYOR.  That’s  why  I  asked,  because,  you  know,  some-
times when you have this great solution, there are these other sort 
of hidden challenges that come with it. In fact, someone was telling 
me,  last  night—I  didn’t  know  this—about  the  little  fluorescent 
bulbs  you  can  buy  now.  Apparently  they  have  just  a  trace  amount 
of mercury in them, and, you know, the theory would be when mil-
lions  and  millions  and  millions  of  those  come  out  on  the  market, 
that little trace amount of mercury could be a real problem. 

Well—I’m sorry, did you want to—— 
Mr.  FRIEDMAN.  I’m  sorry,  Senator  Pryor.  Thank  you  very  much. 
I  just  wanted  to  note  I’m  actually—I’m  very  excited  about  these 
plug-in  hybrids.  I’m  very  excited  about  the  potential  of  cleaner 
biofuels.  I  actually  helped  build  a  plug-in  hybrid  about  10  years 
ago,  with  a  team  of  students.  It  was  very  exciting.  These  tech-
nologies have huge promise, and they’re basically the equivalent of 
hitting  home  runs.  The  problem  is,  sometimes  even  your  best 
home-run hitter strikes out. And we need to make sure that, while 
we’re focusing on these long-run high-risk technologies, that we ab-
solutely are going to need in the next 20–30 years, that we also do 
the basics, that we get the singles, we get the doubles, we increase 
fuel economy with the simple technologies that automakers already 
have. This isn’t about a focus, as even Toyota said, about silver bul-
lets.  We  need  to  take  a  comprehensive  approach,  and  that  means 
the simple steps, with more efficient engines, better transmissions, 
high-strength materials—that’s like singles or doubles; and yes, ul-
timately  we  want  some  of  those  home  runs.  We’re  going  to  need 
some of those home runs if we’re going to kick our oil addiction and 
tackle climate change. 

Senator PRYOR. Good. 
Well, listen, I want to thank the panel. Y’all have been very, very 
patient.  And  I  will  put  you  on  notice  that  Senators  can  submit 
questions  over  the  next  couple  of  weeks,  so  it’s  possible  you’ll  get 
some  written  questions.  And  the  staff  will  work  with  you  on  that. 
And,  like  I  said,  if  y’all  have  your  statements  to  put  in  the  record, 
Senators  will  put  their  statements  in  the  record.  And  I  just  want 
to thank you for doing this and being here today. 

And the hearing is adjourned. 
[Whereupon, at 1:50 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

A P P E N D I X 

SPEECH GIVEN BY JIM PRESS, PRESIDENT, TOYOTA MOTOR NORTH AMERICA 

ON JULY 18, 2006 

National Press Club Luncheon, Washington, D.C. 

Thanks Jonathan and good afternoon everyone. 
With  a  name  like  mine  . . .  being  here  . . .  at  the  National  PRESS  Club  . . . 
in  the  National  PRESS  building  . . .  with  members  of  the  National  PRESS  . . .  is 
not  only  a  dream  come  true  . . .  it  feels  like  a  big  family  reunion!  . . .  so  thank 
you for making me feel so welcome. 

According  to  my  watch,  in  exactly  468  days  . . .  11  hours  . . .  and  30  minutes 

. . . Toyota will celebrate its 50th anniversary in America. 

And  because  we’ve  made  many  great  strides  here,  a  lot  of  people  think  we’ve  al-

ways been a highly successful company. 

But  like  America  itself  . . .  Toyota  comes  from  humble  beginnings  and  had  its 

share of hard times. 

It  may  surprise  you  to  know  that  Toyota  actually  started  out  as  a  textile  loom 
company.  In  1924  . . .  after  watching  his  mother’s  frustration  with  broken  threads 
while weaving fabric . . . our founder, Sakichi Toyoda, created a revolutionary auto-
matic loom that shut down if it detected a broken thread . . . saving time and mate-
rials. 

Later,  Sakichi  sold  the  patent  for  the  loom  and  gave  the  proceeds  to  his  son  to 

start an automobile company. 

The year was 1937 . . . and the company became Toyota Motor Corporation. 
Sakichi passed on more than the legacy of his company, however. He also passed 

on key principles that still form the central values of Toyota to this day. 

One is a fundamental belief in balancing business needs with the needs of society. 

In fact, our vision has always been ‘‘to enrich society through building cars.’’ 

Two other key values are respect for people and ‘‘kaizen’’ . . . the drive for contin-

uous improvement. 

we’ve had our ups and downs. 

Over the years, these values have served us well . . . but like all companies . . . 

Toyota  may  be  profitable  today,  but  we  almost  went  bankrupt  in  the  early  1950s 

. . . and our first product in America was a real dud. 

It’s true. 
During  a  recession  in  early  1950,  Toyota  experienced  severe  financial  problems 
and was forced to lay off some workers . . . the lowest point our business ever expe-
rienced. 

Shortly thereafter, however, the company began its comeback by supplying power-
ful,  all-terrain  utility  vehicles  to  the  U.S.  Army  for  use  in  Korea.  That  highly  pop-
ular  vehicle  went  on  to  become  the  Toyota  Land  Cruiser  . . .  still  one  of  the  most 
admired motor vehicles on earth. 

Toyota  learned  from  these  difficult  times  . . .  and  has  tried  to  stay  responsive 
ever  since.  It  also  realized  it  needed  to  be  a  business  of  the  world  to  survive  long- 
term. 

So,  Toyota  came  to  America  in  1957,  opening  a  showroom/office  in  Hollywood, 
California,  the  same  year  Elvis  sang  ‘‘All  Shook  Up’’  and  the  Russians  launched 
Sputnik. 

With  high  hopes  and  a  post-war  boom  creating  the  need  for  a  second  family  car, 
Toyota launched a sturdy sedan with a strange name . . . the Toyopet Crown. Don’t 
ask me why . . . I was still in grade school at the time. 

Although  the  Toyopet  had  some  remarkable  features  for  its  time,  it  was  badly 
underpowered  and  drove  like  a  tank.  That’s  because  it  was  originally  designed  for 
the  roads  of  Japan  where  it  was  used  extensively  as  a  taxi  . . .  not  the  wide-open 
. . . high-speed . . . highways of America. 

After a year . . . the company had sold just 287 Toyopets and one Land Cruiser.

Sales peaked a year later at just over 1,000 and then dropped off until 1961 . . . 
when  we  withdrew  the  Toyopet  from  the  U.S.  market.  We  survived  by  selling  our 
Land  Cruiser  . . .  the  only  model  we’ve  sold  continuously  in  America  for  nearly  50 
years. 

This  failure  taught  us  a  key  lesson  . . .  you  have  to  design  and  build  products 

that people want and will fulfill their needs . . . not factory needs. 

So, we spent the next 5 years studying the needs of American consumers and re-
turned  in  1965  with  an  all-new  Corona,  a  compact  sedan  that  was  powerful,  eco-
nomical  and  dependable.  It  became  an  overnight  sensation  and  we’ve  never  looked 
back. Today, Toyota has the Number 1-selling passenger car in America . . . Camry 
. . .  the  Number  1-selling  luxury  line  in  America  . . .  Lexus  . . .  and  the  Number 
1 gas/electric hybrid . . . the Prius. 

Our Corolla compact sedan . . . now in its 9th generation . . . is the world’s best- 
selling  passenger  car  of  all  time  . . .  and  is  built  in  the  U.S.,  Canada  and  a  dozen 
other countries. 

We’ve also become a big manufacturer in America with 9 major vehicle and parts 
plants  across  the  nation,  and  the  10th  set  to  open  this  fall  in  San  Antonio.  We’re 
also  adding  a  new  Camry  production  line  and  1,000  new  jobs  to  a  Subaru  plant  in 
Indiana. 

Having  key  manufacturing  plants  in  8  states  . . .  and  one  each  in  Canada  and 
Mexico  . . .  means  nearly  3  out  of  5  vehicles  we  sell  here  are  made  . . .  here  . . . 
in North America. 

In  fact,  we  directly  employ  32,000  Americans  . . .  more  than  General  Mills  . . . 
Texas Instruments . . . or Cisco Systems . . . and our dealers and suppliers create 
another 177,000 jobs. 

When you add other spin-off employment resulting from our presence, the Center 
for  Automotive  Research  estimates  Toyota  is  responsible  for  a  total  of  nearly 
400,000 American jobs . . . roughly equivalent to a city the size of Miami. 

Toyota  also  purchases  $28  billion  in  parts,  materials  and  services  annually  from 

400 suppliers in 35 states, led by Michigan. 

And,  we’re  proud  of  the  fact  that  we’re  ranked  No.  1  in  the  industry  for  supplier 
and  dealer  relationships  . . .  a  tribute  to  our  belief  that  . . .  if  we  help  them  be 
more successful . . . we will be more successful. 

In addition, we’re building a new North American research and development com-
plex in Ann Arbor, Michigan on land six times the size of Disneyland. It will house 
1,100 engineers and designers and serve as the hub for all our efforts to design cars 
and trucks by Americans . . . for Americans. 

So  we’ve  come  a  long  way  in  50  years  . . .  and  we  plan  to  keep  moving  forward. 
Toyota’s philosophy is to build cars where we sell them . . . and our global chair-
man  . . .  Fujio  Cho  . . .  is  asking  those  of  us  in  North  America  to  take  on  even 
greater  responsibility  for  designing,  building,  selling  and  servicing  vehicles  in  this, 
the world’s Number 1 automotive market. 

At  the  same  time,  we’re  also  trying  to  live  up  to  our  vision  of  contributing  to 
American  society  through  our  business  practices  and  community  work.  And,  we’re 
equally proud of those results. 

During  our  first  half  century  here,  Toyota  has  made  significant  contributions  to 
American  business  and  culture,  including:  new  fuel  economy,  safety  and  hybrid 
technologies  . . .  lean  manufacturing  processes  . . .  kaizen  improvements  . . . 
trustworthy  relationships  with  dealers  and  suppliers  . . .  close  cooperation  with 
government  agencies  . . .  and  community  education  programs  like  family  literacy 
centers. 

Underlying all this success, however, are the fundamental principles that Sakichi 

Toyoda instilled in our organization three-quarters of century ago. 

I  come  to  Washington  today  with  THAT  spirit  of  optimism  . . .  determination 

. . . and cooperation. 

I truly believe Toyota CAN BE part of the solution to the great issues of our times 
. . .  issues  like  energy  independence  . . .  air  pollution  . . .  health  care  . . .  safety 
. . . and global warming. 

And  that’s  what  I  want  to  talk  about  today  . . .  the  state  of  the  auto  industry 
. . .  the  contributions  it  makes  to  America  . . .  and  how  it  can  play  a  leading  role 
in helping solve some key issues of society. 

Despite  some  of  today’s  headlines,  the  automotive  industry  is  alive,  well  and  ex-

Globally, sales are rising because people in major developing countries like China, 
India, Russia and Brazil are gaining a higher standard of living and discovering the 
freedom that cars provide. In some ways, they are like America was in the Roaring 
20s.

Here  in  the  United  States,  business  is  steady  . . .  and  as  America’s  population 

approaches 300 million . . . the future is full of promise. 

The  U.S.  auto  industry  is  coming  off  its  third  best  year  in  history,  and  sales  so 

far this year are nearly on the same pace. 

General  Motors  and  Ford  are  taking  bold  steps  to  recover,  and  there  are  signs 
good things are starting to happen. Both were profitable in Asia, Europe and Latin 
America  in  the  first  quarter  and  their  sales  have  doubled  so  far  this  year  in  China 
. . . rapidly becoming the world’s second largest auto market. 

I firmly believe GM and Ford will both come back stronger than ever and be very 
successful. And that’s important because they are vital to our industry and our na-
tional economy. 

What we’re seeing is not the demise of the U.S. auto industry . . . but rather its 
globalization.  Companies  are  re-structuring  and  re-deploying  resources  to  meet  the 
needs of markets all around the world. 

In  fact  . . .  last  year  . . .  for  the  first  time  in  its  long  history,  General  Motors 
sold  more  vehicles  OUTSIDE  the  United  States  than  it  did  in  America.  And  we’ll 
see more of that in the future . . . it’s the way of life in the 21st Century. 

That’s one of the reasons behind the proposed GM-Nissan-Renault alliance. 
All  major  companies  are  looking  for  creative  ways  to  meet  the  challenges  of  in-
creasing  competitive  pressures  and  the  escalating  costs  of  developing  new  tech-
nologies. 

Toyota  has  had  a  good  working  alliance  with  General  Motors  for  more  than  two 
decades, sharing operations at the only West Coast auto plant and doing some joint 
research on advanced technology. 

I can’t speculate on what will happen if GM and Nissan come together, but it does 
illustrate  just  how  tough  and  expensive  it  is  to  compete  on  a  global  basis  as  well 
as the constant need for efficiency in operations. 

It also points to the fact that international auto companies are helping change the 

face and direction of the auto industry. 

Here  in  the  United  States,  international  automakers  like  Toyota,  Honda  and 
BMW are building new plants and adding jobs to the economy almost as fast as GM 
and Ford are shedding them to meet the new realities of the global market. 

In  fact,  international  automakers  have  contributed  almost  ALL  OF  THE 
GROWTH  in  the  U.S.  motor  vehicle  industry  for  the  past  10  years,  according  to  a 
2005 study by the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research. 

The  end  result  is  still  the  same  . . .  a  healthy  and  resilient  auto  industry  . . . 

it just looks a bit different than it did 20 years ago. 

Challenges remain, of course . . . volatile gas prices . . . rising interest rates . . . 
and  increasing  raw  material  costs  . . .  but  overall  . . .  the  industry  is  successfully 
responding to the market and is still growing. 

At  Toyota,  we  expect  U.S.  industry  sales  of  about  17  million  this  year,  up  just 
a hair over 2005. That would make 2006 one of the top three or four in automotive 
history. 

For the long term, annual industry sales of 20 million vehicles . . . 3 million high-
er than now . . . are within reach during the next decade . . . and the whole indus-
try will benefit from the rising tide. 

So . . . where’s the boom coming from? 
First, people are living longer and driving longer. CNW Research found that 7 ve-
hicles—more  than  half  of  the  13  cars  the  average  American  buys  over  a  lifetime— 
are purchased AFTER the head of the household turns 50. 

Sixty  percent  of  the  U.S.  population  will  be  50  or  older  in  the  next  5  years,  and 
Baby  Boomers  won’t  reach  the  peak  of  their  spending  power  until  2009,  so  there 
are enormous opportunities for growth ahead. 

Generation X is maturing and moving in to their prime income earning years. As 
a  result,  they’re  buying  more  than  a  fifth  of  all  new  cars  and  starting  to  purchase 
cars for their children. 

And . . . the 63 million people of Generation Y . . . the second-largest generation 
of  all  time  . . .  have  come  of  age  and  are  starting  to  flex  their  spending  power.  By 
2010, they’ll be buying one of every four new cars. 

All these trends converging at once will create a unique opportunity because . . . 
during  the  next  19  years  . . .  the  U.S.  population  will  increase  by  70  million  . . . 
roughly the populations of California, New York and New Jersey COMBINED! 

Market  drivers  are  on  our  side  too.  Our  gross  domestic  product  is  growing  . . . 
consumer  spending  is  positive  . . .  jobs  are  increasing  . . .  and  productivity  is  ris-
ing. 

This period has all the makings of a new ‘‘Golden Era’’ for the auto industry . . . 
a time of prosperity for auto companies to develop new designs . . . technology . . .

and safety measures . . . that will excite people, save lives and help cars live more 
in harmony with the earth. 

Now that we know the future is bright, I think it’s important to understand why 

having a thriving auto industry is SO vital to America. 

If  you  study  history,  you  know  that  just  about  every  leading  developed  country 
in the world grew under the wings of mighty industries . . . with the auto industry 
leading the way. 

The  United  States  . . .  Great  Britain  . . .  Germany  . . .  Italy  . . .  and  Japan 
. . .  all  rose  to  prominence  by  fostering  a  strong  automotive  industry.  That’s  why 
you see countries like China, Korea, Russia and India now plowing money into their 
fledgling auto industries. 

They know the auto industry is a powerful economic engine that not only provides 

mobility for people and commerce, but also creates long-term prosperity. 

And  while  the  auto  industry  has  taken  some  hits  in  the  U.S.,  it’s  still  a  massive 

contributor to America’s economy. 

For instance: 

—It’s the largest manufacturing industry in the Nation . . . responsible for one 
out of every 10 American jobs 
—It generates nearly 4 percent of the Nation’s GDP 
—The U.S. auto industry spends more than $15 billion on Research & Develop-
ment . . . more than any other manufacturing industry 
—We  buy  more  metals,  plastics,  rubber  and  textiles  than  any  other  business 
. . . including more computer chips than even the computer industry! 
—And my personal favorite . . . all the top 12 American Fortune 500 . . . AND 
Global  Fortune  500  companies  . . .  are  either  automakers  or  support  the  auto 
industry in some significant way 

But  the  auto  industry  is  more  than  just  big  . . .  it  also  makes  a  positive  dif-

ference in people’s lives . . . everyday. 

Cars  arouse  our  aspirations  . . .  tug  at  our  emotions  . . .  and  stimulate  our  de-

sires. 

possibilities. 

products on earth. 

They free us . . . please us . . . give us privacy . . . and provide nearly unlimited 

That’s  why  we  love  them  so  much  and  why  they’re  still  one  of  the  most  popular 

Today,  I  believe  the  time  is  right  to  enlist  the  immense  talent  and  might  of  our 
industry to help solve some of the key issues resulting from a car-loving world . . . 
namely  . . .  oil  dependency  . . .  air  pollution  . . .  traffic  accidents  . . .  and  global 
warming. 

And  the  good  news  is  . . .  the  auto  industry  is  starting  to  make  some  positive 
progress  in  meeting  those  challenges.  At  Toyota,  alone,  we’re  spending  an  average 
of $22.7 million PER DAY on research and development. 

Through  the  industry’s  use  of  lighter  materials,  advanced  engine  and  trans-
mission technology along with cleaner fuels, conventionally powered cars are cleaner 
today than they’ve ever been. 

In  fact,  today’s  vehicles  are  99  percent  cleaner  in  smog-forming  emissions  than 
their  counterparts  from  the  1970s.  And  today’s  light  trucks  produce  fewer  smog- 
forming emissions than cars did in 1993. 

In California . . . more than 20 car models offered by 12 automakers . . . includ-
ing our Camry and Prius . . . are rated Partial Zero Emission Vehicles. They’re not 
only the cleanest gasoline engines ever produced, they’re built to maintain near zero 
emissions throughout their entire life on the road. 

But  that’s  not  enough  . . .  so  we’re  inventing  a  new  wave  of  powertrain  tech-
nologies. Right now . . . this day . . . more than 40 hybrid or alternative fuel vehi-
cles  are  for  sale  in  the  United  States  and  8  million  are  on  the  road.  Plus,  another 
35 models will be introduced in the next 12 months. 

I’m  extremely  proud  that  Toyota  introduced  the  world’s  first  mass-produced  gas/ 

electric hybrid car . . . the Prius . . . nearly 10 years ago. 

Today’s  Prius  has  the  room  of  a  mid-size  sedan,  delivers  about  twice  the  mileage 
of  conventional  cars  and  produces  70  percent  less  smog-forming  emissions  than  the 
average new car today. 

It’s been so popular that we can’t keep it in stock. There’s still a two-month wait 

to get one . . . nearly 3 years after we started selling the current model. 

And Prius was just the beginning. 
Currently,  we  sell  five  Toyota  or  Lexus  hybrids,  including  a  Camry  hybrid  that 
will be built at our Kentucky plant. And . . . early next year . . . we’ll offer a sixth 
one . . . the world’s first V–8 hybrid in our flagship Lexus LS sedan.

In total, we’ve sold more than 351,000 hybrids in the United States. 
It’s a great business for us. We’re making money, saving gas and helping the envi-
ronment . . . all at once. In fact, we’ve sold more U.S. hybrids so far this year than 
Cadillac . . . Buick . . . or Mercedes Benz . . . has sold cars. 
And more will follow because they are making a difference. 
We  estimate  that  all  the  hybrids  we  have  sold  in  America  have  saved  more  than 
155 million gallons of gas . . . enough to fill FIVE tanker ships . . . not to mention 
eliminating more than 3 BILLION pounds of greenhouse gases. 

But  the  real  beauty  of  all  hybrids  is  that  they  are  available  right  NOW.  Ameri-
cans can pick one up at a dealer today and don’t have to make any major sacrifices 
to drive them. 

Even  better,  hybrid  technology  can  be  teamed  with  every  other  promising  tech-
nology to make it even more efficient and fuel-stingy . . . whether its high-tech gas 
engines  . . .  clean  diesels  . . .  bio-diesel  . . .  ethanol  . . .  plug-in  hybrids  . . .  or 
hydrogen fuel cells. 

Make  no  mistake  about  it,  hybrids  ARE  the  technology  of  the  future  and  WILL 
PLAY  a  starring  role  in  the  automotive  industry  during  the  21st  century  . . .  no 
matter what fuel we use or cars we drive. 

That’s why Toyota is NOT backing off its strong commitment to hybrids. We know 

they are absolutely essential to the future success of this industry. 

So  we’re  working  hard  to  bring  down  hybrid  premiums  significantly  by  reducing 

the size of components by up to 75 percent and costs by half. 

Our  target  is  to  offer  hybrid  options  throughout  our  entire  lineup  of  cars  and 

trucks. 

And we’re not alone in our confidence about hybrids. 
Honda  has  three  and  plans  to  add  a  fourth  . . .  Ford  has  two  and  plans  to  add 
three  more  . . .  and  nearly  every  other  automaker  . . .  from  Hyundai  to  Porsche 
. . . plans to introduce hybrids in the very near future. 

Why? 
Because  . . .  increasingly  . . .  Americans  realize  hybrids  are  a  simple  way  to 
make an important difference in curtailing foreign-oil dependence . . . air pollution 
. . .  and  greenhouse  gases  . . .  all  at  once  . . .  plus  . . .  they’re  a  heck  of  a  lot 
of fun to drive. 

Being  able  to  thumb  your  nose  at  gas  stations  on  a  regular  basis  is  icing  on  the 

cake. As good as hybrids are . . . however . . . we’re not stopping there. 

Our  global  president  . . .  Katsuaki  Watanabe  . . .  recently  challenged  all  of  us 

to redouble our efforts to contribute to society in our work. 

He  told  of  us  of  his  dream  to  create  cars  of  the  future  that  can  travel  across  the 
United States on one tank of fuel . . . clean the air while they are being driven . . . 
and prevent accidents and injuries. 

It’s a dream at this point, but that’s where we are headed . . . and Mr. Watanabe 
has committed to vigorously promoting the research and development needed to get 
us there. 

In  traffic  safety  . . .  the  auto  industry  is  already  making  tremendous  strides  by 
using  computers  . . .  sensors  and  other  advances  to  ensure  people  are  better  pro-
tected and cars are smarter in avoiding and handling crashes. 

Today, global automakers are offering more safety features than ever . . . includ-
ing energy absorbing crumple zones . . . headlights that swivel to better light turns 
. . .  lane  departure  warnings  . . .  cruise  control  that  can  stop  a  car  in  city  traffic 
. . .  and  air  bags  for  nearly  every  body  part  . . .  including  my  favorite  . . .  dual- 
stage knee bags! 

And  it’s  working.  Traffic  fatalities  on  U.S.  roads  today  are  the  lowest  since  the 

government began tracking them in 1966 . . . 40 years ago. 

So . . . overall . . . there are many good things happening in our industry today, 

but a lot more needs to be done. 

And when we talk about being part of the solution, those of us in the auto indus-
try  realize  it’s  a  challenging  time  because  we  operate  in  a  market  where  half  of  all 
the  vehicles  bought  by  Americans  are  trucks,  vans  or  SUVs.  They  love  the  utility. 
We  can’t  disregard  the  needs  of  our  earth  . . .  nor  can  we  afford  to  ignore  the 

needs of our customers. 

So  we  have  to  strike  a  balance  in  our  lineups  between  big  trucks  and  SUVs  to 
gas/electric  hybrids  . . .  clean  diesels  . . .  flex-fuel  vehicles  . . .  plug-in  hybrids 
. . . and eventually . . . hydrogen fuel cells. 

And  we’ll  have  to  help  develop  ways  to  produce  and  distribute  a  wide  array  of 

alternative fuels needed to supplement gasoline. 

To make this happen, it will take monumental cooperation among all key players 
. . .  automakers  . . .  oil  companies  . . .  suppliers  . . .  labor  . . .  government  . . . 
educators . . . NGO’s . . . communities . . . and other industries.

I  know  all  of  these  thorny  issues  seem  daunting  at  first  glance,  but  the  time  is 

right and the stakes are too high for us to ignore them. 

Our customers . . . readers . . . viewers . . . and constituents . . . want us . . . 
and  expect  us  . . .  to  come  together  for  the  greater  good  of  society.  We  must  heed 
that call. 

And  I  think  it  starts  with  the  auto  industry  being  more  proactive.  It’s  time  for 
us to stop being the ‘‘against’’ industry . . . and to come out strong ‘‘for’’ something 
important . . . like a better earth and a better quality of life. 

Automakers need to work with government to set reasonable goals to improve fuel 
economy  standards  and  reduce  greenhouse  gases  in  a  way  that  doesn’t  severely 
damage the health of one of America’s most vital industries. Reasonable people may 
disagree, but they can also compromise . . . find common ground . . . and move for-
ward. 

That’s what I will be working on in the future . . . with the full backing of a com-
pany  founded  by  an  inventor  who  wanted  to  help  people  and  contribute  to  a  better 
world. 

Today,  I’m  happy  to  announce  two  key  American  developments  from  Toyota  that 

have been highly anticipated. . . . 

First  . . .  Toyota  is  strongly  considering  introducing  a  flex-fuel  vehicle  program 
in  the  United  States  in  the  near  term.  We’re  already  developing  vehicles  that  can 
operate in ethanol-rich Brazil and we’re optimistic that we can offer similar vehicles 
to American consumers. 

And  . . .  second  . . .  we  are  pursuing  a  ‘‘plug-in’’  hybrid  vehicle  that  can  travel 
greater distances without using its gas engine . . . conserving more oil AND slicing 
smog and greenhouse gases to nearly imperceptible levels. 

Both  projects  will  help  to  solve  some  of  the  key  issues  facing  society  . . .  as  well 

as encourage other automakers to keep moving forward. 

Well,  I  hope  . . .  that  in  the  past  few  minutes  . . .  I’ve  helped  re-kindle  some 
of that unbridled spirit of optimism . . . determination . . . and cooperation I spoke 
of earlier. 

At  Toyota,  we  pledge  to  do  our  part  . . .  to  lend  a  hand  . . .  and  to  work  hard 
with  the  rest  of  the  world  to  help  create  real  solutions  to  the  problems  we  all  face. 
That’s  how  we  spent  our  first  half-century  here  . . .  and  that’s  how  we’ll  spend 

our next 50 years in America. 

Because  . . .  in  the  end  . . .  that  relentless  pioneer  fortitude  to  improve  and 
make  life  better  . . .  not  only  drives  America  . . .  it  also  drives  Toyota  . . .  and 
if  we  let  it  . . .  will  drive  us  all  to  new  heights  of  prosperity  in  the  21st  Century.
