Jill Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer, DigitalGlobe, Inc.

Data  and  images  collected  from  aircraft  and  satellites  provide  information  that
can  facilitate  public  and  private  operations  and  decision-making  to  benefit  society.
In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, remote sensing im-
ages  acquired  from  aircraft  and  from  commercial  and  government  remote  sensing
satellites aided in the emergency response and recovery operations at Ground Zero.
Commercial remote sensing imagery has also been used by the U.S. military for the
Afghanistan  and  Iraq  wars.  In  August  of  2007,  a  National  Aeronautics  and  Space
Administration  (NASA)  unmanned  aerial  vehicle  used  an  infrared  scanner  to  map
wildfires  in  the  western  U.S.  Data  from  Earth-observing  satellites  are  being  com-
bined  with  sources  of  information  on  the  ground  to  manage  natural  resources  and
monitor  changes  in  land  and  Earth  systems.  Aerial  photography  and  images  ac-
quired  from  satellites  are  used  by  State  and  local  governments  to  map  flood  plains
and natural resources, among other applications.

The  field  hearing  will  address  the  opportunities  and  challenges  of  using  remote
sensing  data  to  address  public  and  private  sector  needs.  Witnesses  will  testify  on
the ways that remote sensing data can assist public and private sector users in Col-
orado,  for  instance,  in  identifying  forests  vulnerable  to  fire  and  insect  infestation,
managing water resources, planning urban development and road construction, and
mapping  flood  plains.  Commercial  providers  of  remote  sensing  data  will  testify  on
the  benefits  of  remote  sensing  data  to  State  and  local  governments  and  on  the  role

that commercial data can play in addressing these civil applications as well as those
related to homeland security and national defense.

BACKGROUND

The ability to collect information and images of the Earth’s land, atmosphere, and
oceans from aircraft and satellites has been available for decades. The use of aerial
photography  grew  during  the  1930s  and  1940s  as  a  means  of  military  reconnais-
sance. The first U.S. meteorological satellite was launched in 1960 and the first U.S.
civil  satellite  to  observe  and  monitor  the  land  surface,  Landsat,  was  launched  in
1972.  Over  the  last  forty  years,  the  U.S.  Government  has  helped  advance  the  state
of  civil  space-based  remote  sensing.  Through  NASA  and  the  National  Oceanic  and
Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA),  the  U.S.  Government  has  launched  an  ongo-
ing  series  of  increasingly  more  capable  Earth-observing  satellites  to  support  an
operational  weather  monitoring  service  and  to  conduct  research  to  better  under-
stand  the  Earth’s  land,  ocean,  atmosphere,  and  biosphere,  their  relationships,  and
how  the  Earth  system  changes  over  time.  In  addition,  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey
has  been  responsible  for  archiving  and  managing  civil  land  remote  sensing  data.
The  Land  Remote  Sensing  Policy  Act  of  1992  set  commercial  land  remote  sensing
as  a  U.S.  policy  goal  and  included  a  process  to  license  private  remote  sensing  sat-
ellite  operators.  In  the  early  1990s  the  first  licenses  were  issued  to  private  remote
sensing  operators  and  by  1999  the  first  commercial  remote  sensing  satellite  was
launched.

The  advantages  of  remote  sensing  include  the  ability  to  collect  information  over
large  spatial  areas;  to  characterize  natural  features  or  physical  objects  on  the
ground; to observe surface areas and objects on a systematic basis and monitor their
changes  over  time;  and  the  ability  to  integrate  this  data  with  other  information  to
aid decision-making. Remote sensing from airplanes or satellites can be collected at
various spatial resolutions [spatial resolution refers to the smallest feature that can
be resolved in an image]. High resolution remote sensing images can resolve smaller
features—often less than a meter in size—whereas moderate or lower resolution im-
ages can detect features in a size range of tens to hundreds of meters or larger. Re-
mote  sensing  instruments  may  also  acquire  data  in  different  spectral  bands  of  the
electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., infrared, near-infrared), which provides information,
for example, to help classify and categorize vegetation. Data collected in the thermal
infrared  bands  are  especially  useful  for  water  management.  Light  detection  and
ranging (lidar) instruments provide topographic data that can form the basis of dig-
ital elevation models.

The needs of local government often require high resolution data, which has long
been provided through aerial imagery. The advent of commercial high resolution re-
mote  sensing  imagery  in  the  late  1990s  created  another  source  of  data  that  can
serve  local  and  regional  governments.  In  addition,  States  have  taken  advantage  of
moderate resolution U.S. Government-provided Landsat data to monitor natural re-
sources,  such  as  forests  and  wetlands  that  span  large  areas,  to  analyze  the  ecologi-
cal systems of land and watershed areas, and to help protect wildlife habitats.

State  and  local  governments  can  also  benefit  from  remote  sensing  information  to
better  monitor  land  use,  assist  in  transportation  planning,  and  deal  with  other  in-
frastructure  and  public  safety  issues.  In  addition,  commercial  enterprises  use  the
data  to  help  support  their  businesses.  For  example,  real  estate  companies  use  im-
agery  to  enhance  the  information  provided  on  real  estate  property  listings,  and
transportation companies may use remote sensing data to help route trucks.

Providers of remote sensing data

Remote sensing data for State and local applications is provided by both U.S. Gov-
ernment agencies and by commercial providers. Landsat satellites, which have been
developed  and  launched  by  NASA  since  1972,  are  operated  by  the  Department  of
Interior’s  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS)  and  the  data  are  archived  and  managed
by  the  USGS  Center  for  Earth  Resources  Observation  and  Science  (EROS)  Data
Center. The USGS manages and archives publicly available aerial photographs and
lidar data, among other data sets. The USGS has responsibility for providing future
space-based  land  observation  data  after  NASA’s  launch  of  the  Landsat  Data  Con-
tinuity Mission, which is planned for 2011.

NASA operates fourteen Earth-observing research satellites from space to further
our  knowledge  of  the  Earth  system,  including  its  atmosphere,  oceans,  land  surface,
and biosphere. Some of these spacecraft support applied uses by public and private
organizations. The Terra and Aqua satellites, for example, collect data that support
fire  monitoring  and  the  Quick  Scatterometer  (QuickSCAT)  and  Tropical  Rainfall
Measuring Mission provide data to help improve tropical cyclone and hurricane fore-

casting.  In  addition,  within  NASA’s  Earth  Science  Division,  the  Applied  Sciences
Program  works  with  federal  agency  partners  and  other  organizations  to  apply
NASA’s Earth remote sensing data to decision support tools in the areas of agricul-
tural efficiency, air quality, aviation, carbon management, coastal management, dis-
aster  management,  ecological  forecasting,  energy  management,  homeland  security,
invasive  species,  public  health  and  water  management.  Many  of  the  agencies  and
organizations  that  use  these  tools  provide  services  that  extend  to  the  State,  local,
and regional levels.

The  Department  of  Commerce’s  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administra-
tion (NOAA) operates the Nation’s fleet of civil operational weather monitoring sat-
ellites,  which  provide  data  to  inform  the  National  Weather  Service’s  forecasts.  Fu-
ture  satellite  systems  in  which  NOAA  is  involved,  including  the  National  Polar-or-
biting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS), will also collect glob-
al  data  on  the  Earth’s  weather,  oceans,  land  and  space  environments.  NOAA  also
operates data centers that archive geophysical, climate, ocean, and coastal data and
provide information products to support scientific research and other purposes.

Multiple  independent  firms  across  the  country  provide  services  to  collect  aerial
photography.  Federal  agencies  also  collect  aerial  imagery  to  support  their  services.
United  States  commercial  space  remote  sensing  companies  operate  satellites  and
sell  imagery  and  applications  to  customers  in  the  public,  private,  and  non-govern-
ment  sectors.  The  market  for  commercial  remote  sensing  data  has  largely  been  in
high resolution imagery. The Department of Defense has been a major user of com-
mercial remote sensing imagery. Commercial remote sensing companies support ap-
plications  including  mapping,  national  security,  environmental  monitoring,  urban
planning,  natural  resource  management,  homeland  defense,  and  emergency  pre-
paredness and disaster relief, among many other areas. Several non-U.S. companies
also collect and sell space remote sensing data.

Digital information and communications technologies

The  increasing  capabilities  of  computers  and  communication  technology  have  fa-
cilitated  the  development  of  remote  sensing  applications.  Digital  remote  sensing
data can be acquired from and disseminated over the Internet, and manipulated on
desktop computers. Geographic information systems enable multiple sources of geo-
graphic  information  (such  as  locations  of  power  plants  and  hospitals)  to  be  inte-
grated  with  remote  sensing  images.  Global  positioning  data  can  be  combined  with
remote  sensing  data  sources  to  enable  applications  that  rely  on  accurate  locational
information.  In  addition,  software  tools  allow  multiple  sources  of  remote  sensing
data to be blended together to maximize the information content for remote sensing
applications.

The  availability  of  civil  remote  sensing  data  has  led  to  the  establishment  of  com-
panies  dedicated  to  processing  and  transforming  remote  sensing  data  into  informa-
tion products and applications for users. These companies create mapping products,
such as topographical line maps and digital elevation models, three-dimensional vis-
ualization tools, among other remote sensing applications.

Chairman UDALL. This hearing will come to order. Good morning
to all of you. I want to welcome the panel witnesses that we have,
a  very  esteemed  and  erudite  group  that  we’re  going  to  hear  from
in a few minutes. In particular, I’m pleased that my colleague and
Ranking  Member  on  the  Space  and  Aeronautics  Subcommittee,
Representative  Tom  Feeney  from  the  great  State  of  Florida  has
been able to join me here in our great State of Colorado.

I have to tell you as an aside that Congressman Feeney is a very
committed  aerobic  athlete.  He  got  up  this  morning  and  ran  five  or
six  miles  here  in  Colorado,  which  is  really  impressive  given  that
he’s a flatlander and came from Florida just yesterday.

I’d  also  like  to  mention  that  Congressman  Lamborn,  who  rep-
resents Colorado in the United States House of Representatives, he
does  send  his  regrets.  He  would  have  liked  to  have  joined  us  here
today, but he unfortunately had a previous commitment that made
that impossible.

Before we begin, I’d like to also take the opportunity to recognize
some  of  the  local  officials  who  are  here  and  thank  El  Paso  County
officials  for  their  help  with  today’s  hearing.  I’m  looking  forward  to
today’s  hearing  because  it  touches  on  an  area  that  has  great  rel-
evance  for  the  lives  of  citizens  here  in  Colorado,  as  well  as  for  the
lives  of  folks  all  across  America.  It’s  an  area  that  hasn’t  gotten  as
much  public  attention  as  it  deserves,  especially  relative  to  the  im-
pact  it  has  had  on  the  operations  of  our  State  and  local  govern-
ments,  as  well  as  on  other  public  and  private-sector  activities  in
Colorado  and  elsewhere.  I  am  speaking,  of  course,  of  the  way  that
remote  sensing  data  collected  from  commercial  and  government
spacecraft  and  aircraft  have  been  used  to  provide  societal  benefits,
help strengthen our national defense, and protect our homeland.

And  we  are  in  an  appropriate  place  to  discuss  these  issues  as
Colorado is leading the way in remote sensing technology. Not only
is our State the center of gravity for commercial remote sensing ac-
tivity,  but  our  State  and  local  government  officials  are  also  on  the
cutting edge of using this technology to help Colorado citizens. But
I  don’t  want  to  give  too  much  away  from  our  witnesses’  testimony
today.

I  would  like  to  note  that  we’ve  come  a  long  way  since  some  of
the  first  aerial  photographs  were  taken  of  Boston  in  1860  from  a
tethered  balloon  and  even  from  the  first  civil  remote  sensing  sat-
ellite, TIROS 1, which was launched a century later in 1960 to take
images to be used in weather forecasts. Today, remote sensing data
is  becoming  nearly  ubiquitous  through  the  use  of  advanced  sat-
ellite,  computing  and  communications  technologies.  One  need  only
call  up  web-based  tools  to  access  images  of  cities,  neighborhoods
and unpopulated areas across the country at no cost.

The  U.S.  Government  and  commercial  firms  operate  numerous
aircraft and satellites to collect and deliver the remote sensing data
to  users  on  the  ground.  Today  we  will  hear  more  about  how  these
data  are  used  to  benefit  our  society,  and  what  needs  to  be  done  to
expand on the opportunities this information offers.

We need not look far to see and feel the challenges, some known
and  some  unknown,  facing  our  municipalities  and  our  nation.  Ris-
ing  energy  costs,  our  scarce  water  supply,  and  urban  sprawl  are
complex  problems.  We  need  to  bring  to  bear  the  best  available  in-

formation  to  ensure  that  we  take  effective  and  well-informed  ac-
tions  in  response.  Moreover,  our  natural  environment  and  re-
sources demand our vigilant stewardship. We depend on water, for-
ests, and fertile land, among other resources, to support our needs.
Here  in  Colorado,  we  have  a  close  relationship  with  the  land
around  us  and  are  even  more  aware  of  how  vulnerable  these  re-
sources  are.  Drought,  the  pine  beetle  infestation,  and  fire  have
wreaked  havoc  on  our  communities  and  our  environment.  I  hope
our witnesses can give us insight into how remote sensing data can
be  used  to  help  us  effectively  manage  our  natural  resources.  Our
government  and  private  institutions  also  need  to  ensure  that  we
are prepared in the event of emergencies and crises.

The tragedy of September 11, 2001 brought into stark reality the
need  to  assess  our  infrastructure  and  plan  against  the  risks.  Re-
mote sensing was a vital asset in the response and recovery efforts
at  Ground  Zero.  I’m  very  interested  in  learning  about  how  remote
sensing  data  can  help  our  State,  local  and  federal  agencies  ensure
our  security  at  home  and  abroad  as  well  as  respond  to  emergency
situations.

Our witnesses today will also discuss the role of commercial and
remote  sensing  in  collecting  and  delivering  the  data  to  meet  the
needs  of  both  public  and  private  sector  customers.  There  is  a
science and an art involved in turning the data collected by remote
sensing  instruments  into  sophisticated  tools  to  support  decision-
making,  and  I  hope  our  witnesses  will  help  us  learn  about  the
range and types of products that are available.

In  that  regard,  I  want  to  add  that  as  an  avid  skier,  Tom,  I  was
pleased to learn the Colorado hosts a company [SnowVisual, Inc. of
Vail] that specializes in the use of satellite imagery to support the
snow sports industry. I consider that a true public service.

Congress  has  continued  to  provide  policy  direction  for  civil  and
commercial  remote  sensing  to  ensure  the  continued  availability  of
this  important  data.  The  Land  Remote  Sensing  Policy  Act  of  1992
called  for  the  continuity  of  civil  land  remote  sensing  data  and  es-
tablished the guidelines to enable commercial operation of space re-
mote sensing satellites.

In  addition,  Section  313  of  the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005
directed  NASA  to  support  the  pilot  projects  ‘‘to  explore  the  inte-
grated  use  of  remote  sensing  and  other  geospatial  information  to
address  State,  local,  regional,  and  other  tribal  agency  needs.’’  As
we  work  on  reauthorizing  NASA  this  year,  I  intend  to  explore
whether  Congressional  legislation  has  been  effective  in  addressing
those objectives, and whether Congress needs to consider additional
measures  to  enable  the  expanded  use  of  remote  sensing  data  and
information.

I hope that this hearing will help us also understand how we can
continue  to  improve  the  delivery  of  these  data  to  users  so  that  it
can  be  coordinated  and  shared  among  local,  State,  and  federal  in-
stitutions, especially in the event of a crisis. Finally, I look forward
to  hearing  from  our  witnesses  regarding  what,  if  anything,  needs
to be done to sustain and grow a robust commercial remote sensing
industry in the United States.

Well, we’ve got a great deal to discuss today, and we have a very
capable  set  of  witnesses  before  us.  Before  we  begin  with  today’s

witness, I would like to note that while today’s hearing is focussed
on  uses  of  remote  sensing  data,  Colorado  is  home  to  several  out-
standing  companies  that  design,  build  and  manage  critical  sensors
to  collect  this  information,  including  Lockheed  Martin,  Ball  Aero-
space, and ITT. Without their excellent sensor systems, our compa-
nies  here  today  would  not  have  much  to  work  with.  So  I  acknowl-
edge  their  critical  role  in  this  area  and  am  pleased  that  several
representatives  from  these  companies  are  here  today  and  will  be
submitting testimony for the record.

In closing, I again want to thank all of our witnesses for partici-

pating in today’s hearing, and I look forward to your testimony.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Udall follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN MARK UDALL

Good morning. I want to welcome everyone to this morning’s hearing.
In  particular,  I’m  pleased  that  my  colleague  and  Ranking  Member  on  the  Space
and Aeronautics Subcommittee, Rep. Tom Feeney, has been able to join me here in
the great State of Colorado.

I’d  also  like  to  mention  that  Rep.  Doug  Lamborn,  who  represents  Colorado

Springs in the U.S. House of Representatives, sends his regrets.

He would have like to have joined us here today, but unfortunately he has a pre-

vious commitment that made that impossible.

Before  we  begin,  I  would  like  to  take  the  opportunity  to  recognize  some  of  the
local  officials  who  are  here  and  thank  El  Paso  County  officials  for  their  help  with
today’s hearing.

I  am  looking  forward  to  today’s  hearing,  because  it  touches  on  an  area  that  has
great relevance for the lives of our citizens here in Colorado—as well as for the lives
of folks all across America.

It is also an area that hasn’t gotten as much public attention as it deserves, espe-
cially relative to the impact it has had on the operations of our State and local gov-
ernments—as  well  as  on  other  public  and  private-sector  activities  in  Colorado  and
elsewhere.

I’m  speaking,  of  course,  of  the  way  that  remote  sensing  data  collected  from  com-
mercial  and  government  spacecraft  and  aircraft  have  been  used  to  provide  societal
benefits, help strengthen our national defense, and protect our homeland.

And we are in an appropriate place to discuss these issues as Colorado is leading
the  way  in  remote  sensing  technology.  Not  only  is  our  State  the  center  of  gravity
for commercial remote sensing activity, but our State and local government officials
are  also  on  the  cutting  edge  of  using  this  technology  to  help  Colorado  citizens.  But
I don’t want to give too much away from our witness’s testimony today. . ..

I would like to note that we’ve come a long way since some of the first aerial pho-
tographs  were  taken  of  Boston  in  1860  from  a  tethered  balloon  . . .  and  even  from
the first civil remote sensing satellite, TIROS 1, which was launched a century later
in 1960 to take images to be used in weather forecasts.

Today, remote sensing data is becoming nearly ubiquitous through the use of ad-
vanced  satellite,  computing,  and  communications  technologies.  One  need  only  call
up web-based tools to access images of cities, neighborhoods, and unpopulated areas
across the country at no cost.

The  U.S.  Government  and  commercial  firms  operate  numerous  aircraft  and  sat-
ellites to collect and deliver the remote sensing data to users on the ground. Today
we  will  hear  more  about  how  these  data  are  being  used  to  benefit  our  society,  and
what needs to be done to expand on the opportunities this information offers.

We  need  not  look  far  to  see  and  feel  the  challenges—some  known  and  some  un-
known—facing  our  municipalities  and  our  nation.  Rising  energy  costs,  our  scarce
water  supply,  and  urban  sprawl  are  complex  problems.  We  need  to  bring  to  bear
the  best  available  information  to  ensure  that  we  take  effective  and  well-informed
actions in response.

Moreover,  our  natural  environment  and  resources  demand  our  vigilant  steward-
ship. We depend on water, forests, and fertile land among other resources to support
our needs.

Here  in  Colorado,  we  have  a  close  relationship  with  the  land  around  us  and  are

even more aware of how vulnerable these resources are.

Drought, the pine beetle infestation, and fire have wreaked havoc on our commu-

nities and our environment.

I hope our witnesses can give us insight into how remote sensing data can be used

to help us effectively manage our natural resources.

Our government and private institutions also need to ensure that we are prepared

in the event of emergencies and crises.

The  tragedy  of  September  11,  2001  brought  into  stark  reality  the  need  to  assess
our infrastructure and plan against risks. Remote sensing data was a vital asset in
the response and recovery efforts at Ground Zero.

I want to learn about how remote sensing data can help our State, local, and fed-
eral  agencies  ensure  our  security  at  home  and  abroad  as  well  as  respond  to  emer-
gency situations.

Our  witnesses  today  will  also  discuss  the  role  of  the  commercial  remote  sensing
industry  in  collecting  and  delivering  the  data  to  meet  the  needs  of  both  public  and
private sector customers.

There  is  a  science  and  art  involved  in  turning  the  data  collected  by  remote  sens-
ing instruments into sophisticated tools to support decision-making, and I hope our
witnesses  will  help  us  learn  about  the  range  and  types  of  products  that  are  avail-
able.

In  that  regard,  I  want  to  add  that  as  an  avid  skier,  I  was  pleased  to  learn  that
Colorado  hosts  a  company  [SnowVisual,  Inc.  of  Vail]  that  specializes  in  the  use  of
satellite  imagery  to  support  the  snow  sports  industry.  I  consider  that  a  true  public
service!

Congress has continued to provide policy direction for civil and commercial remote

sensing to ensure the continued availability of this important data.

The Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992 called for the continuity of civil land
remote  sensing  data  and  established  the  guidelines  to  enable  commercial  operation
of space remote sensing satellites.

In  addition,  Section  313  of  the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005,  which  I  helped
enact, directed NASA to support pilot projects ‘‘to explore the integrated use of . . .
remote  sensing  and  other  geospatial  information  to  address  State,  local,  regional,
and other tribal agency needs.’’

As  we  work  on  reauthorizing  NASA  this  year,  I  intend  to  explore  whether  Con-
gressional legislation has been effective in addressing those objectives, and whether
Congress  needs  to  consider  additional  measures  to  enable  the  expanded  use  of  re-
mote sensing data and information.

I hope that this hearing will also help us understand how we can continue to im-
prove  the  delivery  of  these  data  to  users  so  that  it  can  be  coordinated  and  shared
among local, State, and federal institutions—especially in the event of a crisis.

Finally, I look forward to hearing from our witnesses regarding what, if anything,
needs  to  be  done  to  sustain  and  grow  a  robust  commercial  remote  sensing  industry
in the United States.

Well,  we  have  a  great  deal  to  discuss  today,  and  we  have  a  very  capable  set  of

witnesses before us today.

Before  we  begin  with  today’s  witnesses,  I  would  like  to  note  that  while  today’s
hearing is focused on uses of remote sensing data, Colorado is home to several out-
standing  companies  that  design,  build,  and  manage  critical  sensors  to  collect  this
information, including Lockheed Martin, Ball Aerospace, and ITT.

Without their excellent sensor systems, our companies here today would not have

much to work with!

So I acknowledge their critical role in this area and am pleased that several rep-
resentatives from these companies are here today and will be submitting testimony
for the record.

In  closing,  I  again  want  to  thank  all  of  our  witnesses  for  participating  in  today’s

hearing and I look forward to your testimony.

Chairman  UDALL.  The  Chair  now  recognizes  Mr.  Feeney  for  an

opening statement.

Mr.  FEENEY.  Well,  thank  you,  and  I’m  delighted,  Mr.  Chairman,
to  be  in  your  home  state.  It’s  a  great  pleasure  to  be  here.  You  did
point  out  that  I  try  to  run  every  morning.  The  good  news  is  this
morning I ran from the Broadmoor uphill, because if I had started
out downhill, I wouldn’t have made it back and would be out there
wandering  around  breathlessly.  But  I  made  it  back,  and  I  was  in-
spired by the view and really enjoyed it.

I  want  to  also  thank  our  witnesses  for  taking  time  out  of  their
busy  schedules  to  share  their  wisdom  and  concerns  regarding  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 041573 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA08\040708\41573 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

benefits,  future  roles,  and  challenges  confronting  this  increasingly
essential capability we’re talking about today.

It  wasn’t  too  long  ago  that  remote  sensing  data  was  largely  a
product of cameras and other sensors carried on aircraft. But with
the advent of the government- and commercial-owned remote sens-
ing satellites and their growing capabilities, and with the ability to
fuse  databases,  today’s  marketplace  offers  a  dynamic  and  sophisti-
cated array of products.

Remote  sensing  data  provide  essential  tools  that  help  local  and
regional  government  planners  develop  a  comprehensive  and  dy-
namic view of their communities and lands. They enable the capa-
bility  to  monitor  and  measure  the  impacts  and  threats  to  agricul-
tural  and  urban  activities,  such  as  measuring  soil  moisture,  water
use,  pest  infestation,  and  land  development.  Equally  important,  at
the  local  level  remote  sensing  data  has  fast  become  critical  to  the
delivery of emergency services.

One thing Florida and Colorado share now and then is the threat
from  things  like  wildfires,  and  I  look  forward  to  hearing  how  the
many  states  and  regions  that  are  impacted  by  that  threat  can  be
assisted  by  the  technology.  Nationally,  remote  sensing  data  pro-
vides critical information used to monitor and predict weather and
climate  change—again,  Florida  has  our  own  share  of  climate
change—land  use  changes  at  a  macro  scale,  and  monitor  and  pro-
tect our borders.

This  morning  our  witnesses  will  provide  compelling  testimony
highlighting the utility of remote sensing data. In reading over the
witnesses’  testimony,  I  was  particularly  fascinated  by  the  capabili-
ties  developed  by  emergency  response  personnel  to  devise  plans
and  methods  to  deal  with  threats  to  our  communities,  as  well  as
assuring rapid first-response services. As cities grow in size, timely
delivery of these services becomes more complex, and being able to
quickly target police, paramedic and fire services all the more crit-
ical.

While  today’s  hearing  will  be  Colorado  industry  focused,  I  can
tell  you  that  in  my  Congressional  District  along  Florida’s  Space
Coast, we’ve experienced a dramatic rise in population over the last
two  decades.  As  a  consequence  of  this  growth,  ensuring  timely
emergency response services, measuring land-use impacts, and pre-
serving  adequate  fresh  water  sources  are  considerations  that  now
control much of our future development considerations.

With  that,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  again  want  to  thank  you  and  your
staff  for  your  hospitality.  I  am  excited  to  hear  from  our  witnesses
and look forward to a good hearing.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Feeney.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE TOM FEENEY

Mr. Chairman, it’s a genuine pleasure to be here in Colorado to conduct this hear-
ing on the opportunities and challenges of using remote sensing data. I want to join
with  you  in  thanking  our  witnesses  for  taking  time  out  of  their  busy  schedules  to
share their wisdom and concerns regarding the benefits, future roles, and challenges
confronting this increasingly essential capability.

Remote  sensing  data  provide  essential  tools  that  help  local  and  regional  govern-
ment planners develop a comprehensive and dynamic view of their communities and
lands.  They  enable  the  capability  to  monitor  and  measure  the  impacts  and  threats

Equally important, at the local level remote sensing data has fast become critical

to the delivery of emergency services.

Nationally, remote sensing data provides critical information used to monitor and

While today’s hearing will be a bit Colorado-centric, I can tell you that in my con-
gressional  district  along  Florida’s  space  coast,  we  have  experienced  a  dramatic  rise
in  population  over  the  last  two  decades.  As  a  consequence  of  this  growth,  ensuring
timely  emergency  response  services,  measuring  land-use  impacts,  and  preserving
adequate fresh water sources are considerations that now control much of our future
development.

With that, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank again our witnesses for their presence,

and I look forward to their statements.

Chairman  UDALL.  And  we’ll  do  a  little  bit  of  housekeeping  here.
If there are Members of our subcommittee that are not here, Mem-
bers who wish to submit additional opening statements, their state-
ments  will  be  added  to  the  record.  Without  objection,  so  ordered.

Panel 1:

Chairman  UDALL.  Let  me  move  to  introduction  here  of  the  first
panel of the witnesses, and I’d like to recognize each of you in turn,
and we’ll come back to Mr. Byers to begin testimony. We are joined
by  Mr.  Jack  Byers,  who  is  the  Deputy  Director  and  the  Deputy
State  Engineer  for  the  Colorado  Division  of  Water  Resources.  To
his  left  is  Dr.  Simon  Montagu,  who  is  the  Customer  Resource  and
Support  Director  for  the  Denver  Regional  Council  of  Governments,
also  know  as  DRCOG,  fondly  so.  Next  to  Dr.  Montagu  is  the  Fire
Chief,  Mr.  Navarro.  He’s  the  Fire  Chief  of  the  City  of  Colorado
Springs  Fire  Department.  We  just  saw  each  other  last  week  in
Washington.  And  finally,  next  to  Mr.  Navarro,  we  have  Mr.  Frank
Sapio  who  is  the  Director  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture’s
Forest Service, Forest Development Technology Enterprise Team.

Welcome  to  all  of  you.  We  have  some  great  expertise  in  front  of
us. I think you all know, as witnesses, that your spoken testimony
is  limited  to  five  minutes,  and  after  which  Members  of  the  Sub-
committee  will  have  five  minutes  each  to  ask  some  questions  and
further draw out the expertise that’s in front of us.

So we’ll start with Mr. Byers. Mr. Byers, the floor is yours.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  JACK  G.  BYERS,  DEPUTY  DIRECTOR  AND
DEPUTY  STATE  ENGINEER,  COLORADO  DIVISION  OF  WATER
RESOURCES
Mr.  BYERS.  Thank  you  Chairman  Udall,  Congressman  Feeney.  I
really  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  be  here.  And  as  the  first  wit-

ness,  I  guess  I’m  a  native  of  Colorado.  Welcome  to  Colorado  Mr.
Feeney, and welcome back. We appreciate having you here.

My  name  is  Jack  Byers,  for  the  record.  I’m  the  Deputy  Director
and Deputy State Engineer for the Colorado Division of Water Re-
sources  and  I’m  submitting  this  testimony  on  behalf  of  the  State
of Colorado.

I  want  to  point  out  that  we  are  providing  testimony  that’s  rel-
atively  focused  today.  It  does  not  mean  that  we  aren’t  interested
in other areas or that we don’t support the other expertise and in-
formation  being  provided  today.  We  have  what  we  think  is  a  sig-
nificant need that we wanted to bring to the Subcommittee’s atten-
tion.

The other thing I’d like to mention is, although it was clear skies
here  today,  to  the  north  we  had  some  snow.  We  appreciate  that
very  much,  and  our  snow  pack  is  over  100  percent,  which  for  us
is  a  big  deal,  and  skiing  is  tremendous.  So  if  you’d  like  to  stay
longer, we’d be happy to have you ski.

Mr. FEENEY. I just might have to take you up on that.
Mr.  BYERS.  That  would  be  very  good.  As  I  mentioned  today,  we
are providing testimony on a fairly focused area. The State of Colo-
rado  and  many  other  western  states  have  a  critical  need  for  high-
resolution,  thermal  and  infrared  remote  sensing.  This  is  a  par-
ticular remote sensing.

Colorado  and  other  water  agencies  are  actively  integrating  ther-
mal,  infrared  and  remote  sensing  techniques  as  their  management
strategies  to  estimate  actual  crop  evapotranspiration.  That’s  with
combined plant and surface evaporation, to classify land covered by
vegetation  types  and  quantify  water  consumption  by  irrigation,  to
support  transfer  of  agricultural  water  to  growing  cities,  and  I
should say that in a limited area. Here in Colorado, we do a great
deal  of  work  at  trying  to  limit  those  impacts,  and  we  do  following
programs  and  such,  but  we  do  know  that  there  will  be  a  transfer
of water here in Colorado from irrigated agriculture to the growing
cities.  And  this  particular  technology  helped  us  a  great  deal  in
working with that.

We use infrared remote sensing for estimating aquifer depletion,
river  and  canal  transport  modules,  water  rights,  compliance  with
water  rights  as  well  as  water  modeling,  and  most  important,  cli-
mate change initiatives and the scheduling of irrigation diversions.
This  satellite-based  information  is  highly  beneficial  in  terms  of
efficient  water  management.  And  I  might  add  that  much  of  this  is
interstate compact water management, Colorado River Basin water
management.  The  Colorado  River  Basin,  of  course,  is  not  just  a
Colorado  issue  that  you’d  have  Wyoming,  Utah,  Arizona,  and  New
Mexico,  Nevada,  and  I  believe  there’s  a  western  state,  California,
that  has  a  great  interest  in  Colorado  water,  Colorado  River  Basin
water.

As you know, NASA launched the first Landsat satellite in 1972.
Landsat has the world’s longest, continuous program to collect dig-
ital,  multispectral  data  of  the  Earth  from  space.  LANDSAT  4,
launched  in  ’82,  was  the  first  LANDSAT  series  to  carry  thermal
imagery, and each successive LANDSAT has had the thermal infra-
red remote sensing capability.

Currently,  we  have  some  difficulties.  It’s  available  only  on
Landsat  5  and  Landsat  7.  I  won’t  bore  you  with  the  details,  but  I
will  say  that  if  we  aren’t  able  to,  with  our  next  continuation  of
Landsat, carry this camera and this imaging, it could be extremely
detrimental  to  westwide  water  management.  I  know  that  you’re
aware  that  the  Western  States  Water  Council  has  also  taken  the
position  that  this  is  critical,  and  Colorado  joins  the  other  western
states  in  again  reminding  the  Subcommittee  that  this  is  very  im-
portant to us in Colorado as well as the west.

I  want  to  point  out  a  couple  of  key  issues  that  we  had  here  in
Colorado, and that is that I mentioned our snow pack is very good
this  year.  It  hasn’t  been  that  good  in  the  past.  And  when  we  have
to manage ground and we look at the Colorado River Basin and the
potential  of  climate  change,  climate  adaptation.  In  this  infrared
technology,  the  imaging  is  extremely  critical.  So  it  is  a  real
westwide  issue.  I  might  also  say  that  it  helps  us  with  the  evalua-
tion  of  the  impact  of  changing  water  and  land  uses  on  wetlands,
fish  and  wildlife,  and  endangered  species,  another  key  area  that
Colorado would like to continue to work with.

Being  a  native  of  Colorado  and  knowing  that  time  is  short,  I’m
not  one  to  talk  a  whole  lot.  And  in  conclusion,  I  just  want  to  say
that  Colorado  strongly  supports  NASA’s  spending  for  the  thermal
sensor on Landsat. And we don’t believe that the addition of a ther-
mal  sensor  on  Landsat  will  make  a  significant  difference  in  the
scheduling.  I  have  over  30  years  of  federal  service,  both  State  and
Federal  Government,  and  with  tribes,  and  I  would  be  extremely
surprised  if  NASA  put  this  satellite  up  on  time  and  on  schedule.
Therefore,  I  think  that  the  addition  of  this  unit  would  not  signifi-
cantly deter that mission.

We’re  thankful  for  Chairman  Udall,  your  support.  We  also  have
a  great  deal  of  support  from  the  other  Congressional  delegation
within  Colorado.  We  thank  them.  Congressman  Feeney,  we’d  like
to  count  you  toward  that  support  as  well  to  work  toward  the  reso-
lution  of  what  we  think  is  a  critical  problem.  Again,  short  testi-
mony, and I’d be happy to answer any questions.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Byers.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JACK G. BYERS

Hon. Mark Udall, Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:

My name is Jack Byers, Deputy Director and Deputy State Engineer for the Colo-
rado  Division  of  Water  Resources.  I  am  submitting  this  testimony  on  behalf  of  the
State of Colorado.

The  State  of  Colorado  and  many  other  western  states  have  a  critical  need  for
High Resolution Thermal Infrared Remote (TIR) Sensing. Colorado and many west-
ern  water  agencies  are  actively  integrating  Thermal  Infrared  Remote  (TIR)  remote
sensing  techniques  into  their  management  strategies  to  estimate  actual  crop
evapotranspiration (ET), to classify land cover by vegetation (crop) type, to quantify
water consumption by irrigation to support transfer of agricultural water to growing
cities  and  other  uses,  for  estimating  aquifer  depletion  and  river/canal  transport
losses,  monitoring  water-rights  compliance,  water  modeling,  climate  change  initia-
tives and for scheduling irrigation diversions and reservoir releases. For these appli-
cations,  replacing  on-the-ground  reconnaissance  with  satellite-based  information  is
highly beneficial in terms of efficient water management, efficient use of limited re-
sources and improved decision-making.

As  you  know  NASA  launched  the  first  Landsat  satellite  in  1972,  which  makes
Landsat the world’s longest continuous program to collect digital multi-spectral data

of  the  Earth  from  space.  Landsat  4,  launched  in  1982,  was  the  first  of  the  Landsat
series  to  carry  a  thermal  imager,  and  each  successive  Landsat  has  had  a  thermal
infrared remote (TIR) sensing capability.

High resolution TIR (approximately 60 m to 120 m pixel resolution) is needed for
the  water  resources  management  activities  identified  above.  The  quantification  of
water  use  from  Landsat  using  thermal  data  is  the  only  way  to  independently  and
consistently  measure  water  use  on  a  field-by-field  basis  over  large  land  areas.  Typ-
ical  field  sizes  in  the  U.S.  range  from  10  to  160  acres,  or  about  180  meters  to  750
meters  on  a  side.  These  sizes  require  relatively  high  resolution  images  to  produce
information  on  an  individual  field.  Other  satellite  platforms  [MODIS,  (Moderate
Resolution  Imaging  Spectroradiometer),  ASTER,  (Advanced  Spaceborne  Thermal
Emission and Reflection Radiometer), AVHRR, (Advanced Very High Resolution Ra-
diometer),  GOES,  (Geostationary  Operational  Environmental  Satellites),  NPOESS
National  Polar-orbiting  Operational  Environmental  Satellite  System)]  include  TIR
capability  but  at  insufficient  resolution  to  be  useful  at  the  field  scale  level,  or  with
inadequate return times or communication down-link constraints.

Irrigation is the largest user of fresh water in the western U.S., and Landsat ther-
mal  data  is  the  basis  of  the  best  and  least  expensive  way  to  quantify  and  locate
where  water  is  used  and  in  what  quantity.  The  20+  year  record  of  continuous  high
resolution TIR data on future Landsat satellite missions or other platforms is uncer-
tain. Landsat 8 scheduled to launch in 2011 does not contain a thermal imager. The
Landsat  Data  Continuity  Mission  (LDCM)  also  doe  not  currently  contain  specifica-
tion of a high resolution TIR.

Irrigated  agriculture  accounts  for  80–85  percent  of  the  consumptive  water  use  in
the  West.  Increasingly  Western  States  use  TIR  data  to  observe  land-surface  tem-
perature and energy balance differences from evapotranspiration (ET) and calculate
water  consumption  by  agriculture  and  other  vegetation.  Without  FY  2008  funding,
a  TIR  sensor  likely  cannot  be  built  in  time  to  meet  the  2011  launch  timeline  and
this increasingly valuable data will be lost. Use of TIR data for water management
has  only  recently  exploded,  following  a  drop  in  the  cost  of  the  data  after  a  failed
attempt  at  private  commercialization.  Landsat  5  and  Landsat  7  are  the  only  U.S.
sources  of  this  data,  but  Landsat  5  is  nearly  20  years  beyond  its  design  life  and
Landsat  7  equipment  failures  have  left  data  gaps.  Landsat  6  was  destroyed  when
its launch failed. No other U.S. or foreign TIR remote sensing capabilities now, nor
for  the  foreseeable  future,  can  provide  the  workable  features  which  now  allow  a
growing number of data users to measure and monitor water use.

Currently,  higher  resolution  TIR  is  available  only  on  Landsat  5  and  Landsat  7.
Landsat  7  data  after  2003  are  difficult  to  use  operationally  due  to  failure  of  the
scan-line  corrector.  Landsat  5  launched  in  1984  is  24  years  old  and  has  had  power
problems.  The  satellite  was  temporarily  taken  out  of  service  in  October  2007  fol-
lowing  a  cell  failure  within  one  of  the  satellite’s  two  operating  on-board  batteries.
The USGS announced on Feb. 29, 2008 that Landsat 5 is once again collecting and
down-linking land-image data.

Demonstrated water resources planning and management applications include:

urban and suburban landscapes, and natural vegetation,

• quantifying  and  monitoring  consumptive  water  use  by  irrigated  agriculture,
• estimation of transferable water due to land fallowing,
• calibrating ground water models,
• monitoring aquifer depletion,
• computing water budgets for surface water models,
• compliance with limits on water consumption under interstate compacts,
• monitoring the uniformity of irrigation water application,
• crop area, type, pattern and yield estimation,
• monitoring the exercise of water rights, in order to ensure their use according
to State and federal laws, decrees, compacts and negotiated agreements, rules
and regulations.

The  availability  of  thermal  data  from  satellites,  especially  Landsat,  has  enabled
the  development  of  energy  balance  models  that  compute  and  map  actual  crop
evapotranspiration  (ET).  Evapotranspiration  is  a  term  used  to  describe  the  sum  of
evaporation  and  plant  transpiration  from  the  Earth’s  land  surface  to  atmosphere.
Evaporation accounts for the movement of water to the air from sources such as the
soil,  canopy  interception,  and  water  bodies.  Transpiration  accounts  for  the  move-
ment  of  water  within  a  plant  and  the  subsequent  loss  of  water  as  vapor  through
stomata  in  its  leaves.  Evapotranspiration  is  an  important  part  of  the  water  cycle.

This  application  is  the  first  important  use  of  Landsat  thermal  data,  and  it  has  the
clear potential grow dramatically.

• ET  mapping  has  been  accomplished  using  the  SEBAL  (Surface  Energy  Bal-
ance  Algorithms  for  Land)  and  METRIC  (Mapping  ET  at  high  Resolution
using  Internalized  Calibration)  models  in  Idaho,  Utah,  Wyoming,  Montana,
Washington,  New  Mexico,  Texas,  Nevada  and  California.  ET  from  individual
fields  is  estimated  for  purposes  of  water  rights  and  irrigation  water  manage-
ment. The use of METRIC, SEBAL and other processes that rely on Landsat’s
visible, near infrared, and thermal data, are substantially more accurate than
are simpler ET methods that use vegetation indexes, which are a combination
of  the  visible  and  near  infrared  spectrum  only.  The  advantage  of  using  ther-
mal data in mapping water use is that land surface temperature can identify
fields that are short of water and thus have suppressed ET. This information
is  important  to  quantify  actual  water  use  by  both  irrigated  agriculture  and
urban landscaping.

• In  Colorado,  Colorado  State  University  has  developed  and  applied  its  own
version of the surface energy balance model using TIR data, RESET (Remote
Sensing  of  ET),  in  the  lower  South  Platte  and  Arkansas  River  Basins.  Sat-
ellite  based  crop  ET  estimates  will  allow  the  direct  estimation  of  actual  crop
ET when crops are stressed by lack of water, salinity, or other stress factors.
The  ability  to  continue  the  development  and  use  of  models  like  RESET  will
be an important complement to the detailed crop ET/lysimeter research being
initiated in the Arkansas Valley and supported by DWR.

Data  on  cropped  area/acreage  and  classification  by  crop  type  are  periodically  up-
dated  for  use  in  hydrologic  models  used  to  determine  compliance  with  interstate
compacts,  such  as  the  H–I  Model  in  the  Arkansas  River  Basin.  Three  remotely
sensed Landsat imagery bands are needed in this crop classification work: the visi-
ble, near-infrared and thermal. All three bands are used to identify unique crop sig-
natures.  The  loss  of  the  thermal  band  would  seriously  impact  this  work  effort  and
require  greater  expenditure  of  resources  in  ground-truthing  of  the  remotely  sensed
estimates. Additionally, the high resolution imagery allows crop and field identifica-
tion  at  the  scale  of  most  fields  in  the  Basin,  with  potential  several  pixels  per  field.
Colorado  joins  the  Western  States  Water  council  and  other  western  states  in
strong support of increased funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration (NASA) Earth Systematic Missions Program and Landsat 8 thermal infra-
red  (TIR)  imaging  technology  needed  to  better  manage  water  use.  This  data  has
been  provided  since  1982,  from  NASA  Landsat  satellites.  The  Administration  has
not  requested  NASA  FY  2008  funding  for  a  TIR  sensor  on  Landsat  8,  scheduled  to
be launched in 2011. The total estimated cost is $90–$100 million, with $35 million
needed in FY 2008.

At  present,  TIR  data  is  used  for  defining  field  boundaries,  crop-type  and  water
consumption  in  Colorado,  California,  Idaho,  Kansas,  Montana,  Nebraska,  Nevada,
New Mexico, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, while other states are consid-
ering its future use. Related activities have been undertaken or proposed in the Ar-
kansas,  South  Platte,  Bear,  Boise,  Upper  and  Lower  Colorado,  Lemhi,  Milk,  North
Platte,  Upper  and  Middle  Rio  Grande,  Russian,  Salmon,  San  Juan,  Snake,  and
Yakima River Basins. This important data gathering tool is now used or can be used
in the future for or to:

• Calculate water use on a field-by-field and regional scale and encourage water

conservation;

• More  accurate  water  supply  and  demand  planning,  including  multi-basin

water balances and budgets;

• Measure consumptive use of surface and ground water resources and impacts

• Administer  water  rights  and  evaluated  proposed  uses,  changes  in  use  and

of diversions/pumping;

water right transfers;

water use agreements;

• Ensure  compliance  with  interstate  compacts,  international  treaties  and  other

• Plan, mitigate and respond to drought, wildfire and other heat-related events;
• Monitor and assess the impact of climate change on water, wetlands, vegeta-

• Evaluate  the  impact  of  changing  water/land  uses  on  wetlands,  fish,  wildlife,

tion, land uses, etc.;

and endangered species; and

• Many  other  natural  resources,  emergency  management,  military,  and  other

uses of national interest.

The  2000  Census  reported  that  one  third  of  all  Americans  live  in  the  West,  and
that the West accounted for half of the overall U.S. population growth over that dec-
ade.  The  arid  U.S.  West  is  experiencing  explosive  population  growth.  As  Colorado
and  the  West  grows,  water  conservation  is  key,  the  increased  demand  for  scarce
water supplies has shifted water management strategy to developing innovative con-
cepts  for  sustainable  use,  developing  more  effective  methods  to  allocate  limited
water supplies. Water resources managers must understand water consumption pat-
terns  over  large  geographic  areas;  Landsat  provides  an  important  tool  for  effective,
sustainable water management.

Colorado  is  involved  in  the  allocation  and  administration  of  water  rights,  Inter-
state compact compliance and planning for future water needs related to population
growth. For example, in the Colorado River Basin, which supplies the myriad water
needs of millions of people in seven western states, ongoing discussions over sharing
water shortages and balancing future needs depend to a large extent on measuring
and monitoring consumptive water use governed by international treaties, interstate
compacts  and  State  and  federal  laws.  Landsat  thermal  imagery  is  a  tool  with  the
potential to help smooth the way towards a present and future water rights balance.
There are many other examples of such uses or potential uses of Landsat TIR im-
agery  in  water  management  in  the  West.  In  California,  Landsat  data  and  ET-re-
lated information help farmers determine their actual irrigation needs. In New Mex-
ico,  Landsat  data  and  ET  maps  are  helping  water  managers  strike  a  balance  be-
tween  irrigation  demands  and  riparian  vegetation,  as  well  as  the  habitat  needs  of
endangered  species.  In  the  State  of  Washington,  water  users  have  used  ET  esti-
mates, again derived from Landsat thermal data, to encourage conservation of water
resources  and  increase  streamflows  for  fish  while  maintaining  crop  production  and
farm income. Colorado, Kansas and Nebraska are exploring the use of Landsat data
and  ET  to  better  monitor  and  manage  ground  water  uses  in  order  to  control  over-
drafting. Montana uses Landsat data for water quality monitoring. Wetlands delin-
eation,  habitat  identification  and  soil  moisture  monitoring  are  other  Landsat  uses.
In  conclusion,  Colorado  strongly  supports  NASA  spending  for  the  thermal  sensor
on  Landsat  8  and  urges  the  Subcommittee  to  remedy  this  critical  omission.  We  are
thankful  that  Congressman  Udall,  Senators  Allard  and  Salazar,  as  well  as  others
in the Colorado delegation and west-wide continue to work toward resolution of this
critical  problem.  I  would  be  happy  to  answer  any  questions  or  provide  any  further
information the Subcommittee might request.

Thank you for the opportunity to submit this testimony.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  A.  SIMON  MONTAGU,  DIRECTOR,  CUS-
TOMER  RESOURCE  AND  SUPPORT,  DENVER  REGIONAL
COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS
Dr. MONTAGU. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome home.
Congressman  Feeney,  welcome  to  the  great  State  of  Colorado.  I
have  no  doubt  that  our  Chairman  has  filled  you  in  on  the  beauty
of the wonderments of this great state, and I hope you get to enjoy
your  stay  here.  And  I  will  attest  that  everything  he  says  is  true.
This is a fabulous state, and I’m very proud to be part of the com-
munity  here,  the  geospatial  community,  and  present  this  testi-
mony.

I  am  Simon  Montagu,  the  Director  of  Customer  Resource  and
Support  Division  of  the  Denver  Regional  Council  of  Governments,
affectionately  known  as  DRCOG.  We  are  the  federally  designated
metropolitan planning organization for the nine-county metro Den-
ver  region.  We  have  55  other  governments  ranging  in  size  from
communities  such  as  Byers  and  Deer  Trail  on  the  eastern  plains,
all the way out to small mountain communities and the great cross
section  of  communities  that  we  find  in  a  metro  area  like  Denver.
Our  specific  focus  is  on  various  things  like  mobility  services  for
the elderly community, the growing elderly community in Colorado.
Water  quality,  long-range  planning,  and  a  whole  bunch  of  other
things  that  are  best  dealt  with  at  a  forum  that  addresses  these
intrajurisdictional issues at a common place.

We are obviously a great consumer of geospatial information, and
much  of  that  information  derives  from  remote  sensing  technology.
And so, therefore, we greatly appreciate the opportunity to present
before  this  hearing,  and  give  some  sense  of  how  we  deploy  these
resources in our daily work flow, not only at DRCOG, but of course
our 55-member governments that are part of the DRCOG member-
ship.

In  my  written  testimony,  I’ve  gone  into  some  great  detail  about
some  of  the  specific  examples.  And  really  what  I  want  to  do  today
is just draw out one key point.

Our ability to do so is largely because of many decades of federal
investment  in  the  remote  sensing  industry,  and  both  the  indirect
and  direct  follow-on  benefits  are  federal  involvement.  So  really
what I’m asking for is a continuation of that federal investment in
this program.

Some  of  the  specific  things  that  I  did  want  to  mention  is,  you
know, first of all, LANDSAT and NOAA and the various other fed-
eral  programs  of  the  acquisition  side  are  vital.  LANDSAT  data  is
being  used  at  this  moment  in  many  of  our  mountain  communities
in  DRCOG  for  wildfire  management  at  the  strategic  planning  site.
I noticed photos of the Hayman fire which had a devastating effect
on  at  least  one  of  our  counties,  Douglas  County,  in  terms  of  the
water quality issues that came with that. So having imagery avail-
able is important to us.

NASA  and  its  continuing  involvement  in  areas  like  LIDAR  is
very  important  to  us.  LIDAR  is  growing  in  importance  across  the
metro area in terms of its application. I mentioned in my testimony
the fact that we are in the process of collecting LIDAR at this very
moment for the downtown metro area in preparation for the Demo-
cratic  National  Convention  coming  up  in  August.  That  imagery,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 041573 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA08\040708\41573 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

18

that  data  will  be  used  by  the  National  Geospatial  Intelligence
Agency  for  their  strategic  and  tactical  planning  in  regard  to  the
safety of all of those participants that will be at the convention.

We will also get access to that data going forward from that, and
we  should  be  able  to  use  all  of  that  to  help  public  planning.  We’re
very  excited  to  be  able  to  partner  with  the  USGS  and  NGA  to  col-
lect that data.

I  think  the  third  thing  I  want  to  mention  is  the  leadership  that
many  federal  agencies  have  shown  in  terms  of  the  distribution
model  of  moving  this  data  around.  We’re  now  reaching  a  stage  of
maturation  for  this  industry.  We  have  significant  volume  of  data,
and being able to get that data in the hands of the people that need
it is critically important.

The  USGS,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture,  and  other  fed-
eral agencies have taken a leadership role in terms of pushing this
stuff  out  over  the  Internet  and  making  it  more  readily  available.
Organizations  like  mine  and  the  members  that  we  represent  need
this data, but they can’t necessarily store the vast amounts of data
that  are  being  produced.  And  so  being  able  to  access  that  and  call
on it when we need it is vitally important to us.

And  so  looking  forward,  then,  what  I’d  like  to  ask  is  that  the
Committee  generally  think  about  the  continuation  of  support  for
these  federal  programs  that  are  not  only  doing  the  acquisition
work, but also the distribution side of it. Specific programs to men-
tion  are  the  national  map  that  the  USGS  is  working  on,  and  the
National  Agriculture  Imagery  Program,  NAIP,  which  the  USDA  is
working  on.  The  NAIP  Program  allowed  us  to  get  full  coverage  of
the  State  of  Colorado,  very  recently,  which  is  the  first  time  that
we’ve got that.

So just in closing, I’d like to ask specifically for support in terms
of  making  data  more  readily  accessible  to  everyone.  And  part  of
that  is  a  policy  solution  in  the  sense  of  saying  we  want  this  data
in  the  hands  of  folks  that  can  use  it.  Part  of  it  is  also  supporting
those  distribution  mechanisms  that  I’ve  talked  about.  The  other
one  is  to  allow  us  a  pathway  to  the  Federal  Government  pur-
chasing  power  to  buy  some  of  this  imagery  through  federal  pro-
grams  and  make  it  available.  The  Federal  Government  obviously
has  interest  in  the  commercial  side.  We  can’t  afford  it,  and  we’d
like to tap into the federal resources there.

Thank you.
Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Dr. Montagu.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Montagu follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF A. SIMON MONTAGU

The Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) is a member-driven Coun-
cil  of  Governments  comprised  of  55  county  and  municipal  governments  from  across
the greater Denver (Colorado) area. In its sixth decade of service, DRCOG is proud
of  its  collaborative  approach  to  protecting  and  enhancing  the  quality-of-life  that
make our region such an attractive place to live, work and play. Specific focus areas
include mobility, service to older adults, environmental quality, planning for the fu-
ture, public safety, and the provision of high-quality information for sound decision-
making.

DRCOG  has  statutory  responsibilities  under  both  State  and  federal  law  to  plan
for  the  region’s  future,  particularly  its  transportation  infrastructure  and  overall
growth  and  development.  The  signature  product  of  this  process,  Metro  Vision,  em-
bodies  the  collective  vision  of  our  member  governments  for  the  region  and  provides
policies  to  guide  where,  when,  and  how  much  growth  will  occur  across  the  region.

DRCOG’s  stewardship  of  this  regional  planning  process  has  garnered  many  na-
tional  awards  and  attracted  international  attention.  We  are  rightly  recognized  as  a
world leader in collaborative, ‘‘bottom-up’’ regional planning.

A  hallmark  of  our  regional  planning  process  is  the  timely,  accurate  and  objective
data that informs all of the visionary policies embedded in Metro Vision. Geospatial
data—information  about  the  physical,  social  and  economic  make  up  of  our  region—
is vital to this process.

DRCOG  is  a  major  producer  and  consumer  of  geospatial  data,  large  volumes  of
which  derive  from  remote  sensing  (RS)  technologies.  DRCOG  is  therefore  appre-
ciative  of  the  Committee’s  interest  in  the  role  of  remote  sensing  data  in  regional
planning, and grateful for the opportunity to present our views on both the opportu-
nities  and  impediments  to  making  the  information  derived  from  RS  technologies
more broadly available.

REMOTE SENSING DATA USE IN DENVER METRO REGION

Federal  investment  in  research  and  development  has  and  continues  to  be  a  sig-
nificant  driver  in  the  growth  and  expansion  of  the  Nation’s  geospatial  information
industry.  DRCOG  and  its  member  governments  leverage  this  investment  in  signifi-
cant ways on a daily basis. We manage our urban environment, monitor the quality
of  our  natural  resources,  plan  for  the  future,  and  make  informed  choices  about
where  to  invest  our  scarce  resources  all  with  the  help  of  data  derived  from  remote
sensing technologies.

Across the Denver metro area and the State of Colorado as a whole, local, regional
and  State  agencies  have  come  to  rely  on  data  derived  from  three  general  types  of
remote-sensing technologies:

• Aircraft-based aerial photography
• Multi-spectral data
• LIDAR and related technologies

AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY

DRCOG  and  our  member  communities  have  relied  on  film-based  aerial  photog-
raphy for many decades. High-quality orthophotography provides local communities
with  spatially  accurate,  distortion  free  base  data  layers  critical  to  all  of  their  plan-
ning, public safety and governmental management functions.

Since 2002, DRCOG has led a successful consortium of public and private partici-
pants  to  jointly  acquire  high-quality  digital  aerial  photography  for  the  DRCOG  re-
gion,  exploiting  the  collective  buying  power  of  30  individual  organizations.  We  re-
peated  the  effort  in  2004  and  2006.  and  planes  are  currently  in  the  air  collecting
2008  imagery.  This  year,  the  project  expanded  well  beyond  the  territorial  limits  of
the  DRCOG  member  region,  allowing  our  neighbors  in  Weld  and  Grand  Counties
to also benefit from this joint purchasing power.

The benefits to our member governments and all the other public and private sec-
tor  participants  are  very 
tangible.  High-quality,  high-resolution  digital
orthophotography  of  the  type  we’re  collecting  typically  cost  $100–$150  per  square
mile.  By  contrast,  the  average  cost  for  participants  in  the  2006  project  was  a  mere
$11  per  square  mile.  The  average  cost  for  DRCOG  members  was  less  than  $1  per
square mile.

Colorado  has  a  great  tradition  of  this  type  of  grass-roots,  collaborative,  goal-fo-
cused  effort.  DRCOG’s  public-private  consortium  model  is  mirrored  in  the  Colorado
Springs  area,  the  emerging  nine-county  (15,200-square-mile)  Sangre  de  Cristo  Re-
gional GIS Cooperative, and in the communities on the Western Slope.

Recently,  the  State  of  Colorado  acquired  statewide  aerial  photography  under  the
auspices of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agriculture Imagery Pro-
gram (NAIP). This program allows State and local entities to leverage regular aerial
photography  acquisition  efforts  by  the  USDA  to  obtain  statewide  photography  for  a
fraction of the total cost. Colorado was able to take advantage of this effort in 2005
resulting in the first complete coverage of the entire state all acquired at one time.
The State would never have been able to afford this photography if not for the NAIP
program. The data is now used widely by numerous federal, State and local entities,
as well as the private sector and universities.

MULTI-SPECTRAL IMAGERY

The  broad  availability  of  space-based  multi-spectral  sensors  (MSS)  in  the  1970s
and  1980s  extended  and  enhanced  the  functionality  of  traditional  aerial  photog-
raphy,  providing  local,  regional  and  State-level  planners  with  a  cost-effective  way
to  analyze  and  map  critical  environmental  processes  across  large  geographic  areas.

Multi-spectral  imagery  offers  a  number  of  data  products  from  across  the  electro-
magnetic spectrum providing information that is imperceptible to the naked eye.

Many communities across the DRCOG region now utilize Color-Infrared (CIR) im-
agery,  for  example,  to  map  impervious  surfaces  and  monitor  surface  runoff  and
downstream  water  quality.  CIR  data  also  plays  a  key  role  in  both  the  tactical  and
strategic aspects of wildfire management across the region. Douglas County, for ex-
ample,  recently  acquired  LANDSAT  5  data  for  mapping  vegetation  and  modeling
fuel loads in the Pike National Forest and other heavily vegetated parts of the coun-
ty. Other cities and counties across the region have similar mapping programs.

Broader applications of MSS-derived data include mapping the massive Pine Bee-

tle infestation in our mountain counties.

LIDAR AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES

Light  Detection  and  Ranging  (LIDAR)  and  other  related  ranging  technologies
(Interferometric  Synthetic  Aperture  Radar—IFSAR—for  example)  are  becoming  in-
creasingly  important  to  communities  up  and  down  the  Front  Range  as  acquisition
costs decrease and data from these sensors become more widely available.

LIDAR  provides  an  extremely  cost-effective  method  for  collecting  detailed  and
highly  accurate  terrain  information.  This  data  then  feeds  into  a  range  of  sophisti-
cated  modeling  processes  that  allow  communities  to  more  accurately  map  not  only
ground  features  within  their  communities,  but  also  key  anthropogenic  structures
such as buildings, bridges, dams, etc.

This information provides the foundation for the construction of three-dimensional
models  of  cities  that  are  now  widely  used  in  land  use  and  transportation  planning,
emergency  response  tactical  plans,  and  as  aids  in  community  involvement  and
visioning efforts.

Specific  examples  of  LIDAR  use  in  the  Denver  region  include  security  planning
around  the  upcoming  Democratic  National  Convention.  Working  with  several  of
DRCOG’s  member  governments,  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  is  currently  acquiring
LIDAR  data  on  behalf  of  the  National  Geospatial–Intelligence  Agency  (NGA).  The
NGA  will  use  LIDAR  to  identify  line-of-sight  and  other  tactical  vantage  points  to
plan  their  surveillance  and  response  strategies  to  ensure  the  safety  of  all  those  at-
tending the convention.

Several of DRCOG’s larger member governments have acquired LIDAR in support
of  their  planning  and  public  works  programs.  The  City  and  County  of  Broomfield,
for  example,  is  using  LIDAR  data  in  planning  the  development  of  a  new  reservoir.
They also rely on the data for initial assessment of new roads and trail systems and
for  understanding  the  runoff  and  drainage  implications  of  planned  developments.
LIDAR  is  also  playing  an  important  role  in  the  modernization  of  flood  insurance
mapping across the state.

CHALLENGES AND IMPEDIMENTS

Although  the  use  of  data  from  remote-sensing  technologies  continues  to  grow
across  the  DRCOG  region,  there  are  a  number  of  structural  and  logistical  impedi-
ments  that  both  undermine  our  ability  to  use  the  existing  data  products,  and  limit
our ability to integrate other RS data into current planning efforts.

Cost  remains  a  significant  challenge.  The  price  tag  for  the  2008  DRCOG  aerial
photography  project  is  over  $1  million,  in  a  climate  of  little  to  no  revenue  growth
among  the  participating  jurisdictions.  This  price  reflects  the  combined  purchasing
power of 30 public and private sector partners working to acquire this data collabo-
ratively.  Market  rates  for  digital  orthophotography  continue  to  increase  despite  the
emergence  of  new  capture  and  processing  technologies  (direct  digital  capture;  auto-
mation,  off-shore  processing,  etc.).  Pricing  of  commercial  satellite-based  imagery  re-
mains similarly high, relative to the data budgets of most cities and counties.

High  costs  mean  local,  regional  and  State  entities  can  acquire  this  data  less  fre-
quently  than  they  require.  Our  imagery  program  struggles  to  keep  pace  with  the
rapid  growth  of  the  nine-county  region,  but  can  only  afford  to  acquire  new  data
every  two  years.  DRCOG  estimates  that  our  region  adds  on  average  about  100,000
new people, 65,000 new jobs and nearly 30 square miles of new development in any
given two-year cycle. Understanding and managing this growth with out-of-date im-
agery  is  a  significant  problem  for  both  the  staffs  and  elected  officials  of  DRCOG’s
member governments.

‘‘Solving’’  this  impediment  is  unrealistic  expectation.  The  experience  from  Colo-
rado is that communities working together, collaboratively, can bring their collective
buying  power  to  the  commercial  marketplace  and  reap  significant  savings  over  the
cost  of  going  it  alone.  This  ground-up  approach  remains  the  most  realistic  solution
to  cost  containment  at  this  time,  at  least  in  the  Colorado  context.  The  only  request

that  I  would  put  to  the  Committee  is  to  continue  to  fund  the  various  federal  pro-
grams—most notably the National Map program led by the USGS and the National
Agriculture  Imagery  Program  led  by  the  USDA—that  allow  federal  agencies  to  col-
laborate with local partners to secure geospatial data all across the country.

A  second  impediment  is  the  challenge  associated  with  the  sheer  volume  of  re-
motely-sensed  data  that  is  now  available.  The  estimated  volume  of  data  from
DRCOG’s  2008  aerial  photography  acquisition,  for  example,  is  over  10  terabytes.
Few  of  our  member  governments  have  the  internal  capacity  to  store  and  maintain
all of this data. The problem compounds with each new project, as part of the value
of remote-sensed data lies in the ability to review multiple years of data at the same
time (comparing changes over time).

Another dimension of this problem is the effort associated with distributing data.
While Internet bandwidth continues to improve, online distribution of the large data
sets associated with most remote sensing technologies remains impractical.

Fortunately, new models of data distribution are starting to emerge that facilitate
the distributed storage and distribution of large geospatial data sets. Data through-
put under these models is greatly reduced, pushing only the needed geographic win-
dow  down  to  the  end-user,  rather  than  distributing  the  entire  geographic  data  file.
Examples  of  this  model  exist  in  both  the  public  and  private  sector.  Several  Colo-
rado firms have established a national presence in this realm—DigitalGlobe, Inc. in
Longmont, CO, Intrasearch Inc. in Englewood, CO, and Sanborn Map Company here
in  Colorado  Springs.  On  the  public  sector  side,  federal  agencies  are  playing  a  lead
role.  The  USDA  maintains  its  ‘‘Data  Gateway,’’  the  USGS  has  a  long  history  using
the  Internet  for  data  distribution,  and  the  ‘‘e-government’’  initiatives  sponsored  by
the  Federal  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB)  lead  to  the  establishment  of
the ‘‘Geospatial One-stop’’ portal.

Federal  investment  in  research  and  development  provided  the  initial  impetus  for
the  evolution  of  the  Internet  and  federal  agencies  continue  to  lead  by  example  in
their  innovative  use  of  this  infrastructure  to  distribute  the  tremendous  wealth  of
geospatial  information  we  now  possess.  I  urge  Members  of  the  Committee  to  recog-
nize the important leadership role of the Federal Government in this realm and con-
tinue  to  support  those  federal  programs  that  are  augmenting  the  data  distribution
services of the private sector.

My  final  comment  in  the  area  of  impediments  is  of  a  technical  nature.  Like  all
technologies,  remote  sensing  data  applies  better  to  some  applications  than  others.
Traditional  multi-spectral  technologies  have  tended  to  provide  very  broad-acre  im-
agery  that  works  well  at  a  strategic  planning  level,  but  typically  falls  short  when
used for more tactical, response-type planning. This is particularly true in the area
of  wildfire  management.  Whereas  the  existing  satellite  imagery  in  the  public  do-
main  provides  useful  input  into  fuel  load  modeling  for  understanding  the  threat  of
wildfires across our region, the resolution of the available imagery renders it unus-
able  in  emergency  response  situations.  Commercially  available  data  provides  better
resolution,  but  at  a  price  that  is  often  beyond  the  means  of  the  typical  fire  protec-
tion districts that serve DRCOG’s mountain communities.

OTHER DESIRED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

On behalf of my peers across the DRCOG region and the State of Colorado, I wish
to acknowledge the continued leadership of the Federal Government in the acquisi-
tion and dissemination of remote sensing data. I hope that the Committee now sees
how  local  and  regional  governments  leverage  this  federal  investment  every  day  in
providing better, more efficient government to all our citizens.

DRCOG  and  its  members  have  shown  that  local  governments  can  realize  signifi-
cant cost-savings when communities band together to jointly acquire remote sensing
data. This type of collaborative endeavor is not limited to the local or regional scale.
With  that  in  mind,  I  would  like  to  suggest  two  other  areas  where  greater  federal
engagement  would  significantly  enhance  the  accessibility  of  remote  sensing  data  to
all levels of government.

First,  recognizing  the  vast  data  libraries  and  the  ongoing  acquisition  activities  of
the  Federal  Government,  local  and  regional  governments  across  the  country  have
much  to  gain  from  greater  access  to  these  federal  resources.  Part  of  the  solution  is
a policy decision to make the data more broadly available. The other part is contin-
ued  support  for  the  innovative  data  distribution  strategies  that  we  are  seeing  from
key federal agencies like the USGS and USDA.

Second,  following  the  collaborative  models  that  we  see  across  the  State  of  Colo-
rado, I would urge the Federal Government to allow local and regional governments
to  leverage  the  tremendous  purchasing  power  of  the  Federal  Government  in  the
commercial  remote  sensing  data  marketplace.  This  industry  continues  to  grow  and
is a vital part of our economy, particularly so in the Denver region. However, many

22

of  the  vital  data  products  sold  in  the  commercial  marketplace  are  simply  out  of
reach  of  the  small  public-sector  entities  that  would  benefit  most  from  these  prod-
ucts. Allowing these entities to work through federal agencies (and their purchasing
programs)  to  acquire  commercial  imagery  would  realize  significant  benefits  at  the
local level.

Chairman UDALL. Mr. Navarro.

STATEMENT OF MR. MANUEL NAVARRO, FIRE CHIEF, CITY OF

COLORADO SPRINGS FIRE DEPARTMENT

Mr. NAVARRO. Thank you. My name is Manuel Navarro; I am the
Fire  Chief  of  the  Colorado  Springs  Fire  Department  in  Colorado
Springs, Colorado. I think it’s important to note that we have sub-
mitted  a  brief  and  we  have  many  details  in  that  and  I’ll  just  sum
those for you.

I  think  it’s  important  to  note  that  I’m  a  practitioner.  I’ve  been
in the field for 41 years. I know you’re saying, how old is this guy?
The reality is that I’d like to talk to you a bit about both mitigation
and  response  from  a  fire  chief’s  standpoint  and  how  we  can  lever-
age  some  of  the  technology  in  our  organization  to  help  us  with
those issues.

On  the  mitigation  side  of  it,  I  call  your  attention  to  some  of  the
things  that  have  happened  in  California.  And  by  the  way,  I  spent
28  years  in  the  fire  service  in  California.  It  wasn’t  open  in  1991
when  a  fire  devastated  several  residential  properties  and  killed  25
individuals.  The  map  we  used  that  day  was  hand  drawn,  and  that
was  in  1991.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  that  map—I  drew  some  of  the
maps in that. That’s how bad the technology was on the fire service
side of it. We’ve been able to use that technology here, at least that
geospatial technology to get some good maps now.

Because  one  of  the  concerns  we  have,  obviously,  is  seven  days  a
week,  24  hours  a  day,  when  a  call  for  service  comes  in,  we  need
to  find  that  location,  and  specifically  that  address,  and  we’re
leveraging  that  now  with  other  GIS  data  to  be  able  to  weigh  the
situation  so  that  we  have  situational  awareness  when  we  get  on
the site.

Oftentimes, we’re sent to facilities or occupancies where we have
no  idea  what’s  in  that  unless  we’ve  experienced  inspection  before-
hand.  And  given  the  size  of  our  community,  we  simply  can’t  do

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 041573 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA08\040708\41573 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

23

that.  So  that  base  layer  and  all  the  technology  that  follows  that  is
extremely, extremely important on the response side.

I think you’ve got a picture of the Hayman fire. I’m not sure ex-
actly  when  that  was  taken.  Some  of  my  planning  staff  was  able  to
facilitate some of the planning efforts there. But I will tell you, on
the  ground,  in  a  wildland  fire,  most  fire  officers  really  have  to  lay
a  map  out  in  front  of  them  and  guess  at  what’s  happening.  They
don’t  have  realtime  analysis.  We  simply  weren’t  able  to  leverage
that with programs like Global Hawk and Predator. And I can tell
you  how  exciting  it  is  from  the  response  side  of  that  to  be  able  to
have  situational  awareness  and  realtime  information  relative  to
what’s going on with the fire.

This  is  real  personal  stuff  for  us.  A  few  years  ago  there  was  a
fatality  in  a  San  Diego  fire.  My  nephew,  who  is  a  firefighter  in
California,  was  at  the  end  of  that  cul-de-sac  and  was  told  to  back
out  and  stop,  back  out.  And  when  he  came  back  out,  he  saw  the
fatality there because the fire had turned on him and moved. When
you’re in that position, it’s so hard to tell.

On  the  mitigation  side  of  that,  we’ve  done  some  very  interesting
things. We’re able to use risk analysis and portray that on our web
site.  And  our  folks  here  in  Colorado  Springs  are  able  to  go  to  that
web site, take a look at that, and be partners with us.

Chairman  UDALL.  Mr.  Navarro,  can  you  pull  the  mic  a  little  bit
closer?  Some  of  the  audience—no,  you  wouldn’t  know.  Some  of  the
audience—all the witnesses need to have it a little closer so the au-
dience can hear.

Mr. NAVARRO. We’ll try this. Is that better?
On  the  mitigation  side  of  it,  we’ve  been  able  to  leverage  that
technology  to  be  able  to  get  partners  in  our  community.  And  most
recently,  the  greatest  example  of  that  is  FEMA  has  awarded  us
with a million dollar grant here in Colorado Springs. The match for
that  has  been  neighborhood  associations  and  local  government  to
be able to clean up some of the fuel. What we hope to prove is that
on  the  front  end  of  these  disastrous  fires,  we  can  have  more  info.
Just in concluding, I must tell you that local government is really
strapped to be able to leverage technology. When I talk to my staff,
they simply say we don’t have enough staff. We don’t have enough
resources, and the projects that we have in front of us, just to meet
the  mission  locally,  is  overwhelming  us.  We  were  able  to  leverage
an  AVL  system  simply  because  we  got  really  lucky.  Public  works
got a grant from the Federal Government to be able to do that, and
that helped us move that AVL system on our fire trucks. Otherwise
we wouldn’t have had that at all.

In conclusion, thank you very much. Thank you for your interest.
And the fire service is more than willing and able to be able to sit
down with you and talk about some of the specifics relative to this
type of technology.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Navarro.

Introduction

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  the  Committee  on  Science  and
Technology  and  discuss  with  you  some  of  the  experiences  that  the  City  of  Colorado
Springs  and  the  Colorado  Springs  Fire  Department  have  encountered  in  applying

remote  sensing  and  geospatial  information  systems  to  improve  our  emergency  re-
sponse and preparedness.

My  name  is  Manuel  Navarro;  I  am  the  Fire  Chief  of  the  Colorado  Springs  Fire
Department.  As  a  41-year  veteran  of  the  fire  service,  I  am  honored  to  present  to
you  today.  Across  my  career  and  as  the  Chief  of  the  Colorado  Springs  Fire  Depart-
ment,  I  have  had  the  privilege  to  lead  firefighters  and  emergency  response  per-
sonnel in dangerous and life threatening situations with a constant focus on our re-
sponsibility  to  protect  lives  and  property  from  fire,  medical,  and  disaster  events.
Finding  new  ways  to  plan  for,  prepare,  and  respond  to  emergency  situations  is
something that I have charged my department with from the day I arrived in Colo-
rado Springs. I think we have made some impressive advances in improving citizen
preparedness,  community  resiliency,  emergency  response  planning  and  operational
situational  awareness  that  I  would  like  to  share  with  the  Committee.  At  the  same
time,  we  have  encountered  some  hurdles  and  lessons  along  the  way  that  I  would
also like to share.

In my presentation to the Committee, I will discuss the importance of gaining and
maintaining  situational  awareness  of  the  environment  necessary  for  effective  and
safe firefighting. In the City of Colorado Springs, we have realized that remote sens-
ing  technology  and  geospatial  information  are  key  tools  in  improving  our  ability  to
shape  the  environment  that  we  operate  in.  We  now  rely  on  these  tools  to  help  us
prepare  and  plan  for  potential  hazard  and  risk  events,  communicate  with  our  citi-
zens and adjacent emergency response agencies, and make the right decisions while
deploying  in  initial  attack  or  during  sustained  operations  during  a  large  scale
wildland fire.

Before  I  offer  testimony  regarding  the  aforementioned  issues,  I  think  it  is  impor-
tant  that  we  establish  a  common  understanding  of  the  complexities  involved  with
managing fire service response to emergencies, 24 hours each day, seven days each
week.  As  we  deliver  emergency  services,  there  can  be  no  excuses  regarding  our  re-
sponse—lives and property are at stake; it must be timely, we must get to the prop-
er  address  or  location  and  we  must  be  proficient  in  rendering  the  services  we  pro-
vide. With that said, we have grown to understand the value that planning has for
our organization. We must respond, we will respond, we will make tough decisions—
but  there  is  no  need  for  us  to  have  to  make  those  kinds  of  decisions  without  the
benefit  of  a  very  strong  planning  process.  One  bit  of  institutional  humor  for  us  is
that the fire service represents 150 years unimpeded by progress. Well, fortunately,
we have undergone a sea-change in our thinking where we have come to understand
that planning and mitigation work literally ‘‘shapes the battlefield’’ in which we op-
erate tactically. For Colorado Springs, the operational response mission must be ac-
complished, in our case, from a network of twenty fire station locations housing fire
companies  that  are  staffed  by  three  different  working  shifts.  But  it  doesn’t  require
that  we  make  our  hard  decisions  without  the  benefit  of  thorough  analysis  and
thoughtful  response.  Management  of  the  training,  logistics  and  standard  operating
procedures of fire companies to support this mission is challenging for any fire chief.

Emergency Response

When  we  receive  a  911  call  for  emergency  services,  the  appropriate  emergency
unit  must  be  notified  and  that  crew  must  correctly  navigate  heavy  apparatus
through  heavy  traffic  conditions  and  difficult  weather  conditions  at  any  time,  day
or night, to the address or location. Accurate maps, occupancy of buildings and loca-
tion  of  response  vehicles  is  essential  in  completing  our  mission  and  to  ensure  the
safety of the responding firefighters.

The Colorado Springs Fire Department has employed geospatial technology for 25
years  to  create  the  most  accurate  map  for  the  city  and  adjacent  areas.  As  our  city
has  experienced  significant  growth  and  development  over  the  last  several  decades,
the  ability  to  accurately  map  new  and  changing  streets  have  proven  to  be  critical
in  dispatching  emergency  apparatus  rapidly,  effectively,  and  efficiently.  Using  the
accurate base maps, we employ additional GIS technologies to layer critical informa-
tion that can be utilized to provide additional information associated with that loca-
tion or address to responding fire companies.

I  cannot  adequately  express  to  this  committee  how  important  it  is  to  provide  re-
sponding  fire  officers  with  critical  information  regarding  a  specific  building  or  haz-
ard. The information allows fire officers to efficiently make critical decisions on the
way  to  and  at  the  scene  of  an  emergency.  Those  decisions  based  on  accurate  infor-
mation,  coupled  with  the  education  and  experience  of  the  fire  officer,  lead  to  safely
controlling  emergencies  while  at  the  same  time  limiting  property  damage,  saving
lives and providing for the safety of responding emergency personnel.

Lacking local resources to develop this additional functionality was a challenge for
us  here  in  Colorado  Springs.  The  city’s  Public  Works  Department  recently  received

a federal transportation grant to develop Automatic Vehicle Location System (AVL)
technology.  The  fire  department  had  an  opportunity  to  collaborate  with  our  own
City Traffic and Public Works Divisions in the development of the AVL system that
provides the following functionality:

• Locates every emergency that is identified by the Emergency Dispatch Center

and transmits it to the traffic signal system computer.

• Provides  every  dispatched  emergency  unit  with  a  map  display  showing  a

route to the location.

• Preemption  that  signals  the  traffic  lights  along  that  route  to  turn  green  as

the emergency unit approaches the intersection.

• An  on-board  touch-screen  computer  developed  by  the  department’s  I.T.  staff,
mounted  in  each  emergency  vehicle  to  archive  and  display  additional  layers
of information.

• Situational  awareness  delivered  through  the  on-board  computer  which  dis-

plays available data for the scene.

• Wireless,  hands-free  data  updates  (each  fire  station  has  been  linked  so  that

data can be updated to the on-board computer).

The base map originally developed with geospatial technology has been leveraged
to work with the AVL system. It now provides routing capability for emergency ve-
hicles to the location of an emergency and provides safe emergency response by con-
trolling  intersections.  The  base  map  is  also  used  to  identify  individual  addresses
which  in  turn  is  used  to  access  the  base  for  layers  of  GIS  information  essential  to
safe  and  effective  emergency  operations.  In  the  near  future,  fire  companies  will  be
able to develop pre-plans for individual occupancies that will be added as additional
layers of information available in the apparatus to responding fire officers.

We are in the final process of reconciling our map centerline data in our computer
aided  dispatch  (CAD)  system  to  provide  automatic  vehicle  location  dispatch  and
move  away  form  the  current  CAD  tabular  dispatch  system.  Once  we  have  moved
to  that  technology  we  will  be  able  to  improve  response  times  without  adding  addi-
tional responding units to the department by always dispatching the nearest appro-
priate emergency unit.

Wildfire Risk

laboriously  walking  and 

The  department  has  also  employed  remote  sensing  in  the  form  of  hyperspectral
imagery to study the city’s wildland-urban interface areas and watersheds. This re-
mote  sensing  technology  provides  us  with  detailed  mapping  of  fuels,  construction
features, vegetation types, densities and locations that previously could only be cat-
egorized  and  mapped  by 
inspecting  each  area.
Hyperspectral  remote  sensing  data  is  one  of  the  most  promising  data  collection
sources for planning and mitigation efforts related to wildland fire, community risk,
and environmental hazards. As a remote sensing data source, hyperspectal informa-
tion  allows  communities  to  collect  high  quality  data  and  extract  multiple  informa-
tion  elements  from  a  single  flight.  We  have  collected  and  analyzed  hyperspectral
data  to  detect  and  map  specific  features  such  as  the  type  and  status  of  wildland
fire  fuels,  the  densities  and  location  of  high  risk  vegetation  species,  and  the  condi-
tions  and  physical  traits  of  at-risk  structures  and  access  roads.  All  of  these  traits
are  of  special  concern  during  active  fire  fighting  operations  and  typically  are  un-
available prior to incident operations. Highly accurate and data rich remote sensing
sources like hyperspectral systems provide decision-makers with true situational un-
derstanding  and  awareness  of  the  terrain,  access,  fuel  and  vegetation  layers  and
building arrangements and locations. Within the Colorado Springs Fire Department,
this data is used across almost all of the department’s operations ranging from miti-
gation to response.

CSFD staff is currently developing a wildland urban interface (WUI) plan for the
drainage areas and neighborhoods in the city’s wildland urban interface. We will in-
tegrate  the  layer  of  fuels  data  provided  by  the  hyperspectral  imagery  with  current
information  on  fire  behavior  to  provide  responding  command  officers  with  planning
and  operational  situational  awareness.  We  are  also  developing  a  map  layer  with
specific  information  to  assist  command  officers  in  positioning  staged  apparatus,
evacuation  zones  and  safe  refugee  areas,  as  well  as  displaying  other  potential  fire
control and resident safety issues.

Community Education

26

The  department’s  Community  Services  staff  has  also  employed  this  technology  to
inform  and  motivate  community  members  to  ‘‘FireWise’’ 1 their  property.  We  have
created  an  interactive  web  site  that  maps  each  individual  property  and  their  risk
rating  with  regard  to  wildfire  risk.  Individual  property  owners  can  then  access  the
information  utilized  to  develop  the  risk  rating  of  that  property  and,  more  impor-
tantly, how that rating can be improved by employing FireWise risk-reduction treat-
ments to the property.

We  have  employed  technology  to  leverage  the  efforts  of  staff  in  educating  the
thousands  of  households  in  the  Colorado  Springs  wildland-urban  interface  areas.
Here  in  Colorado  Springs  we  have  approximately  40,000  residential  properties  in
these  interface  areas.  Effective  use  of  technology  has  greatly  enhanced  our  efforts
in  community  education  with  regards  to  wildfire  mitigation.  I  think  this  is  an  im-
portant distinction to make. We have transitioned the use of remotely sensed infor-
mation from purely reactive and tactical to a forward thinking, mitigation and plan-
ning  effort.  I  think  it  is  understood  by  this  group  that  remote  sensing  technologies
are  tried  and  true  in  the  operations  arena—particularly  the  larger  the  incident  is.
However,  we  have  come  to  see  much  more  value  that  these  rich  data  sets  can  pro-
vide  to  us  long  before  the  incident  begins.  Our  focus  has  increasingly  transitioned
toward  using  the  information  provided  by  remote  sensing  as  a  real  asset  in  our
planning  and  mitigation  work.  Our  use  of  hyperspectral  data  is  just  one  example
of how a local jurisdiction provided the specific information with which we could em-
ploy our risk analysis and thus educate individual property owners.

The  use  of  these  technologies  has  provided  us  with  an  opportunity  to  change  our
approach  to  creating  a  safer  community.  By  employing  innovative  uses  of  remote
sensing and geospatial technologies, citizens in our city are educated and motivated
to treat their own property and not rely on local government to provide that service.
We  have  developed  a  culture  in  our  city  that  encourages  citizens  to  partner  with
local government to provide public safety. By creating our web site we have greatly
improved  our  efforts  in  getting  individual  property  owners  and  neighborhood  asso-
ciations  to  partner  with  us  in  mitigating  the  fuel  in  these  interface  areas.  Perhaps
this seems subtle, but it is an important note: these efforts have created an environ-
ment  in  which  our  citizens  actively  participate  in  their  own  outcome,  effectively
sharing  the  responsibility—and  that,  after  all,  is  the  very  definition  of  community.

Grant Proposals

The  layers  are  also  used  to  develop  grant  proposals  utilized  to  secure  funding
which  support  community  wide  fuel  mitigation  projects.  In  a  recent  example,  the
City  of  Colorado  Springs  was  awarded  a  one  million  dollar  mitigation  grant  by
FEMA. That FEMA grant was the only one of its kind in the Nation. I firmly believe
we  would  not  have  been  successful  in  winning  that  grant  had  it  not  been  for  the
robust  data  we  were  able  to  employ  in  the  planning  and  justification  for  the  grant.
It was successful in large measure due to the capability we developed with our risk
analysis  of  wildland  fire  issues  using  hyperspectral  data.  We  were  able  to  leverage
our  investment  in  remote  sensing  to  make  a  strong  case  to  FEMA  that  we  knew
both the nature of our problem and how to fix it.

Community Risk

Additionally,  we  have  also  embarked  on  developing  a  very  sophisticated  commu-
nity  risk  assessment  model.  The  model  uses  geospatial  data2 which  are  evaluated
by all community stakeholders, to assess and categorize risk. It is a mixed-methods
approach that couples the input from subject matter experts and the community in-
puts  (qualitative)  with  mathematical  models  (quantitative)  that  describe  not  just
where events have happened, but the very causes of those events.

The  results  of  these  assessments  are  clearly  displayed  on  a  map  with  shadings
indicating  the  degree  of  risk  severity.  The  visual  display  quickly  communicates  the
location and extent of community risk so that citizens and policy-makers can openly
and  with  confidence  discuss  mitigation  strategies.  This  is  an  important  success  for
us to highlight. This illustrates the success we have in communicating with our pub-

1 ‘‘The  national  Firewise  Communities  program  is  a  multi-agency  effort  designed  to  reach  be-
yond  the  fire  service  by  involving  homeowners,  community  leaders,  planners,  developers,  and
others  in  the  effort  to  protect  people,  property,  and  natural  resources  from  the  risk  of  wildland
fire—before a fire starts. The Firewise Communities approach emphasizes community responsi-
bility  for  planning  in  the  design  of  a  safe  community  as  well  as  effective  emergency  response,
and  individual  responsibility  for  safe  home  construction  and  design,  landscaping,  and  mainte-
nance.’’ (www.firewise.org)

lic  due  to  our  use  of  GIS  and  remote  sensing  technologies.  If  a  picture  is  worth  a
thousand  words,  how  much  is  a  dynamic  living  picture  of  risk  and  exposure  worth
to  a  community  that  can  access  it  24  hours  a  day,  seven  days  a  week.  We  prepare
to respond 24x7, so why wouldn’t we mitigate and communicate the same way.

One  of  the  innovative  approaches  that  we  are  taking  is  that  the  results  of  the
qualitative criterion can be displayed next to quantitative criterion and where there
is  convergence;  policy-makers  can  have  assurance  that  they  are  developing  a  good
decision  that  represents  realistic  informed  consent  in  the  affected  communities.
Where the data does not converge, policy-makers can call out subject matter experts
and citizens to discuss the difference in opinions.

Funding

Locally,  we  have  been  challenged  in  developing  the  technology  needed  to  provide
operational  decision-makers  and  policy-makers  with  accurate,  current  and  com-
prehensive  data.  Grant  funding  for  the  AVL  system  came  to  us  by  happenstance
through  our  Traffic  Department.  They  had  a  900  MHz  radio  system  and  wanted  to
develop  the  vehicle  location  technology.  We  were  able  to  place  staff  on  the  project
and  not  only  developed  and  tested  their  applications  but  developed  the  application
for  our  emergency  apparatus.  We  were  very  fortunate  to  be  able  to  take  advantage
of  that  transportation  grant  (Congestion,  Mitigation  and  Air  Quality—CMAQ)  as
such funding is not available locally, through the state or through National Fire Ad-
ministration grants.

The  funding  necessary  for  the  geospatial  and  remote  sensing  over  flights  was
carved  out  of  current  operational  budgets  and  partnering  with  other  interested  city
departments.  We  were  very  limited  in  the  amount  of  resources  we  could  employ  to
gather  this  data.  Again,  this  technology  and  data  is  vital  to  our  public  safety  work
but  we  found  very  little  support  in  the  form  of  grant  dollars  to  complete  this  work.
As  my  staff  discusses  the  issues  regarding  development  and  use  of  technology  in
the  fire  service,  they  portray  the  problem  in  clear  and  concise  terms;  there  is  no
staff  dedicated  to  these  projects,  there  is  little  additional  time  to  allocate  to  these
projects,  and  there  is  no  funding  to  have  the  work  completed  by  others  and  yet  we
have this essential mission to complete.

Education

I  would  add  that  employing  current  technology  is  also  a  significant  educational
challenge  for  the  fire  service.  Few,  if  any,  fire  service  officers  that  are  adept  and
capable  in  emergency  operations  work  have  formal  education  or  experience  with
modern  technology.  We  have  been  fortunate  to  have  an  accomplished  information
technology  staff  in-house  that  supports  our  public  safety  mission.  The  collaboration
between  experienced  fire  officers  and  a  very  sophisticated  information  technology
staff has allowed us to take advantage of finite resources and create innovative ap-
proaches to community safety employing new technology.

IT Staff

When  I  took  command  of  this  department  some  14  years  ago,  I  had  a  depart-
mental  information  technology  division.  We  had  fire  operations  staff  working  side
by  side  with  a  very  talented  group  of  IT  and  GIS  staff.  The  combination  of  those
two  groups  of  very  talented  employees  allowed  us  to  investigate,  research,  and  cre-
ate opportunities to employ technology in the work we do. The results are that this
department  is  on  the  leading  edge  of  utilizing  technology  to  improve  the  effective-
ness and efficiency of the department.

Training

Operationally, fire officers rely on training, education and experience as a founda-
tion  in  making  decisions  regarding  management  of  a  variety  of  emergency  situa-
tions.  Then  at  the  scene  of  an  emergency,  officers  and  firefighters  must  apply  that
training  and  situational  understanding  to  the  facts  and  observations  made  at  the
incident to develop situational awareness.

Technology can provide a large quantity of data through GIS layers supported by
remotely  sensed  information  and  associated  with  a  specific  site  and  a  specific  type
of  incident.  That  information  will  not  be  easily  processed  nor  understood  unless  we
begin to train fire officers on how to recognize that information and use it in a situa-
tional  awareness  process.  The  fire  service  currently  lacks  that  training  and  I  know
of no support for that training.

2008 California Fire Siege Example (move to emergency response and oper-

ations section)

The  information  available  with  the  use  of  technology  must  also  be  employed  in
the  operational  planning  process  prior  to  an  emergency  and  as  the  emergency  in-
volves.  We  saw  a  graphic  demonstration  of  this  application  in  the  recent  California
wildfires. At that fire, overhead assets in the form of satellite platforms, unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) from NASA and DOD, National Guard, civil and commercial
fixed  wing  and  space-borne  assets  were  able  to  bring  into  the  planning  process  of
the  command  post  real-time  data  including  full-motion  video.  Technology  available
to  the  military  that  provides  situational  awareness  was  deployed  in  California  and
from my opinion has the potential to greatly improve our ability to manage and con-
trol these large wildland fires—particularly if these assets are directed by local and
State  authorities  with  a  mechanism  to  quickly  capture,  store,  and  disseminate  the
information.  It  doesn’t  really  matter  if  we  have  this  powerful  remote  sensing  capa-
bility  and  we  don’t  put  the  information  in  the  hands  of  the  actual  boots  on  the
ground  when  they  need  it.  We  should  thoughtfully  consider  how  we  could  institu-
tionalize  this  capability  vice  scrambling  when  large  events  inevitably  overtake  us.

Personal Experience

I  can  tell  you  from  experience  that  management  of  large  wildfires  is  a  most  dif-
ficult  task  and  having  current  and  comprehensive  data,  maps  of  predicted  fire  be-
havior,  and  fire  location  and  live  video  feeds  are  of  tremendous  assistance  in  man-
aging  the  fire,  saving  citizens  at  risk,  and  controlling  the  position  of  fire  apparatus
and  firefighters.  In  1991,  I  was  a  command  officer  with  the  City  of  Oakland  when
in  one  afternoon  we  lost  over  3,300  residential  properties  and  the  lives  of  twenty
five people.

We did not have a map of the fire’s perimeter or know the extent of damage until
late  that  night.  The  perimeter  of  the  fire  was  drawn  by  hand  over  an  existing  city
map by a fire officer hanging out of a helicopter as it flew the area.

There  are  significant  issues  with  bringing  this  technology  to  the  fire  service.  As
stated,  there  is  a  lack  of  resources  and  funding  to  acquire  the  technology  and  to
gather  the  data.  There  is  also  the  issue  of  training  fire  officers  to  understand  and
employ  that  data  in  their  decision-making.  We  also  have  an  issue  with  standards.

Standards—move above Personnel Experience

In association with the International Association of Fire Chiefs, there has just re-
cently  been  established  a  Technology  Advisory  Council  to  standardize  data  collec-
tion,  storage,  and  exchange.  The  National  Fire  Protection  Association  has  also
begun to appoint a technical committee on Fire and Emergency Service Geographic
Information  Systems  that  will  explore  geospatial  data  needs  and  current  applica-
tions  to  develop  common  fire  service  standards  and  protocols  for  exchanging
geospatial  data  between  GIS  user  agencies  and  organizations  during  emergencies.
Perhaps for the first time, essential data elements gathered by local responders can
be  utilized  by  incoming  mutual  partners  whether  they  are  local,  State,  or  federal.
The  development  of  standards  is  an  essential  step  in  developing  GIS  information
that can be utilized by the fire service.

We recently hosted a meeting of many individuals involved with these projects so
that  they  could  share  their  individual  efforts  in  order  to  develop  a  National  Fire
Service  Data  Model  for  gathering  this  data.  That  effort  should  receive  continued
support as we explore the development of this standard and look towards implemen-
tation at the local level.

Personal Comments

I  perceive  in  the  implementation  of  remote  sensing  technology  that  there  are
many issues regarding the use in the fire service for response and mitigation activi-
ties. I do not profess to have sufficient expertise to comment on the technical aspects
of  development  of  such  technology.  I  can  tell  that  you  what  we  have  done  here  in
Colorado Springs has greatly leveraged our ability to provide the best in public safe-
ty with regards to fire control and suppression and community education.

I  will  offer  that  the  leadership  in  the  fire  service  and  the  emerging  leadership
must  be  trained  so  that  they  can  fully  employ  the  available  emerging  technology.
Most fire officers have learned their trade through training, classroom and didactic,
and with application of that training in practical experience. The introduction of re-
mote  sensing  and  GIS  into  the  work  we  do  must  be  accompanied  by  training  and
practice.  That  training  will  come  at  some  cost.  As  with  any  training  program,  we
must  provide  the  training  staff,  develop  the  curriculum,  and  pay  for  the  wages  of

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 041573 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA08\040708\41573 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

29

the  attendees.  The  training  then  has  its  associated  cost,  all  of  which  must  be  pro-
vided with finite resources currently available to local government.

I have been asked by the Committee to discuss how we have utilized remote sens-
ing  data  and  to  also  comment  on  barriers.  Briefly,  I  have  discussed  with  the  Com-
mittee  some  of  our  work  regarding  how  we  have  utilized  this  technology.  With  re-
gards to barriers I would comment that there are several:

• Funding  for  such  work  is  lacking  at  the  local  level.  Local  government  has  fi-
nite resources that are wholly dedicated to providing services and at the fed-
eral  level,  there  are  few  available  resources  for  this  emerging  technology  in
the fire service.
• As we develop this technology and move to applications for response and miti-
gation,  a  national  standard  should  be  supported  so  that  local,  State  and  fed-
eral response resources can all utilize the data.
• There is a need to develop national policies, standards, and functional models
to  enable  data  sharing  and  coordinated  data  exchange  starting  with  local
agencies  for  decision  support  and  situational  status  to  incident  commanders
during escalating events of national significance.
• Implementation  of  this  technology  must  be  accompanied  with  training  of  the
current  and  emerging  fire  service  leadership.  Perhaps  it  is  possible  to  fund
the  U.S.  Fire  Administration  to  develop  a  program  through  the  U.S.  Fire
Academy that provides support curricula with appropriate GIS and RS train-
ing.  Additionally,  some  sort  of  train-the-trainer  program  for  GIS  specialists
in the fire service would create capacity nationally.
• The federal grant funding systems could recognize the value of the implemen-
tation  of  these  technologies  as  a  key  piece  in  planning  and  risk-reduction  ef-
forts. It has been difficult to use grant mechanisms for these purposes despite
the  huge  successes  we  have  had  in  our  communities  when  we  have  used  re-
mote sensing and GIS together.
• The  geospatial  intelligence  strategy  to  support  national  security  and  pre-
paredness  must  start  at  the  local  level.  This  cannot  happen  until  locals  have
access  to  effective  GIS  and  remote  sensing  products  that  support  their  daily
operational requirements. Effective widespread implementation of fire service
technology  will  require  appropriate  data,  tools,  funding,  and  education  deliv-
ered to local responder agencies. These components need to be defined by ap-
propriate  input  from  the  fire  service,  for  the  fire  service.  This  can  be  accom-
plished  by  working  through  existing  national  fire  service  organizations  and
leadership  structures,  most  of  whom  have  identified  GIS  and  remote  sensing
as an important technology for supporting their mission.

Conclusion

In closing, the Committee was also interested in comments regarding what would
be  most  valuable  to  the  fire  service  in  expanding  the  use  of  remote  sensing  data
for  the  future.  We  certainly  support  the  use  of  geospatial  information  systems  and
the remote sensing data that feeds data to it. Fire officers will find that information
extremely  helpful  in  managing  and  controlling  emergencies.  The  technology  to  sup-
port  those  activities  in  our  estimation  should  be  further  researched  and  funding
needs to be provided to make that technology available at the local level.

We  have  been  very  successful  in  employing  data  from  remote  sensing  platforms
to enhance our community education programs, to assist in the planning efforts with
regards to fuel mitigation, and to provide an easily understood display of community
risk to citizens and policy-makers. We were able to employ remote sensing to gather
data  that  would  take  prohibitive  personnel  and  time  commitment  to  gather.  We
would support further research in the use of this technology to gather additional in-
formation such as roof types and other data essential to full development of commu-
nity risk attributes.

Colorado  Springs  has  shifted  from  binders  on  bookshelves  to  a  community-based,
geospatially  enabled  risk-assessment  methodology.  We  have  strived  to  understand
the  nature  and  characteristics  of  risk  and  then  systematically  work  on  risk  reduc-
tion  activities.  We  are  developing  mitigation  strategies  in  addition  to  our  response
applications.  We  believe  that  responding  to  emergencies  without  really  seeking  to
know what the underlying causes of the problems are is only part of creating a safer
community.  We  support  technology  that  provides  us  with  the  data  required  to  un-
derstand and analyze the community risk.

We  have  been  very  fortunate  in  Colorado  Springs  with  developing  and  utilizing
remote  sensing  technology.  We  have  utilized  local  staff  and  collaborated  with  some
extremely talented private sector contractors.

We  would  strongly  encourage  the  Federal  Government  to  support  these  types  of
activities  at  the  local  level  in  order  to  improve  the  fire  service’s  response  to  public
safety as well as provide situational awareness for incoming local, State, and federal
assets during major emergencies.

Again,  thanks  for  having  me  here  today,  I  would  be  happy  to  take  any  questions

you might have.

Chairman UDALL. Mr. Sapio, the floor is yours.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  FRANK  J.  SAPIO,  DIRECTOR,  FOREST
HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ENTERPRISE TEAM (FHTET), U.S. DE-
PARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
Mr.  SAPIO.  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,
thank you for this opportunity to testify before you today on remote
sensing data, its applications and its benefits.

The Forest Service uses remote sensing technology ‘‘to foster the
development  and  use  of  technologies  to  protect  and  improve  the
health  of  America’s  forests.’’  Remote  sensing  technologies  have
serviced  resource  management  well  in  the  past,  and  will  be  an  in-
creasing  part  of  land  management  in  the  future.  When  used  effec-
tively,  they  provide  a  means  of  data  collection  that  is  accurate,
timely, and cost effective.

In  our  technology  development,  we  try  to  select  the  appropriate
remote  sensing  methodology.  The  spatial,  temporal  and  cost  capa-
bilities of each sensor must be carefully evaluated for each project.
If  an  appropriate  match  can  be  made,  the  Forest  Service  will  try
to use that technology to aid it in the natural resource assessment
efforts.  This  assessment  must  be  tactical,  and  they  use  imagery
from  a  broad  scale  to  a  fine  scale.  Some  systems  are  government-
owned. Some systems are commercial systems.

Remote  sensing  is  used  at  three  principal  scales,  a  broad  scale
to  a  strategic  regional  and  national  assessments,  and  mid-scale  to
assess  landscapes,  and  a  fine  scale  to  aid  in  the  mapping  of  forest
stands and areas of damage.

On a broad scale, our current data-collection methodologies from
national  insect  and  disease  assessments  rely  heavily  upon  aerial
sketchmapping  surveys.  These  surveys  are  accomplished  by  aerial

observers  flying  in  light  aircraft  who  sketch  observations  on  paper
or  on  pen-based  portable  computers.  Though  somewhat  limited  in
spatial  accuracy,  this  low-tech  approach  is  appropriate  technology
and  is  particularly  well-suited  for  trend  analysis  because  we  can
cover almost the entire country annually. This method was used in
developing a 2007 map of infestation in Colorado, and has been our
method of choice for some time.

Imagery  collected  at  a  broad  scale  also  includes  satellite  images
Imaging
from  NASA,  and  NASA’s  Moderate  Resolution 
Spectroradiometer  (MODIS)  which  provides  250-,  500-meter  and
one  kilometer  spatial  detail.  MODIS  is  used  to  detect  and  monitor
wildland  fires,  assist  incident  coordination,  and  to  portray  the  fire
situation to the public. MODIS is utilized with other geospatial lay-
ers  and  forestry  inventory  information  to  produce  large-area  forest
cover-type maps and biomass maps.

Mid-scale  imagery  such  as  Landsat  which  is  30-meter  resolution
and  is  used  with  geospatial  data  and  forest  inventory  information
to  produce  individual  tree  species  maps  to  be  used  as  insect  and
disease  host  layers  for  the  production  of  the  National  Insect  and
Disease  Risk  Map,  a  five-year  strategic  assessment  produced  by
Forest  Health  Protection.  My  office  is  currently  preparing  for  the
2010 National Insect and Disease Risk Map. We are actively press-
ing for more modern methodology to be used in Colorado.

Landsat  also  provides  the  predominant  mid-scale  imagery  driv-
ing  the  LANDFIRE  project.  LANDFIRE  is  a  five-year,  multi-part-
ner  project  that  produces  consistent  and  comprehensive  maps  and
data  describing  wildland  fuels  and  fire  regimes  across  the  United
States. It is a shared project of the U.S. Forest Service and the De-
partment of Interior. LANDFIRE data products are created at a 30-
meter  resolution  data  set.  LANDFIRE  information  is  produced  at
scales  that  may  be  useful  for  prioritizing  and  planning  hazardous
fuel reduction and ecosystem restoration projects.

At  a  fine  scale,  aerial  imagery  is  utilized  to  aid  in  the  mapping
of forest stands and damaged areas at a fine scale and is used rou-
tinely for forest inventory and local resource assessments. The U.S.
Forest Service participates in the USDA National Agricultural Im-
agery  Program,  which  collects  one-meter  digital  imagery  on  a  five-
year  recurring  basis.  This  imagery  is  used  in  mapping  various  re-
source conditions.

Project level planning requires finer resolution imagery. The For-
est  Service  and  other  cooperating  field  units  often  utilize  digital
high-resolution  satellite  imagery  to  assess  local  forest  issues,  such
as damaged and dead trees in the landscape. To be able to discern
trees  that  are  just  beginning  to  exhibit  the  effects  of  stress,  field
practitioners  prefer  the  six-inch  and  one-foot  spatial-resolution
range.  Airborne  imagery,  usually  photography,  as  opposed  to  the
satellite  imagery,  is  currently  the  imagery  of  choice  for  most  field
foresters. In fact, my group is currently processing a large batch of
photography for Colorado.

We  also  use  remote  sensing  technologies  for  complex  issues  tied
to  land  use.  For  example,  the  growing  metropolitan  fringe  is  ex-
tending  farther  into  rural  areas  with  attractive  recreational  and
aesthetic  amenities,  and  areas  where  structures  and  other  human
development  meet  or  intermingle  with  undeveloped  land.  This

land-use  change  has  significant  implications  for  wildfire  and  pest
management.

We  use  a  myriad  of  geospatial  technologies  to  conduct  analysis

of WUI at different spatial and temporal scales.

Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement. I would be
happy  to  answer  any  questions  you  or  other  Members  of  the  Sub-
committee have. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF FRANK J. SAPIO

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity
to  testify  today  on  remote  sensing  data  applications  and  its  benefits  for  the  U.S.
Forest Service.

Introduction

As  Director  of  the  Forest  Health  Technology  Enterprise  Team  (FHTET),  I  am
charged  with  managing  the  group’s  mission  ‘‘To  foster  the  development  and  use  of
technologies to protect and improve the health of America’s forests.’’ Remote sensing
is one of the geospatial technologies we use to fulfill that mission.

FHTET  is  a  Forest  Service  unit  within  State  and  Private  Forestry.  The  team  is
comprised  of  two  offices,  one  in  Morgantown,  West  Virginia,  and  the  other  in  Fort
Collins, Colorado. In Morgantown, members of the team work on the biological con-
trol of invasive pests, pesticide application technologies, and the study of non-target
impacts  of  pesticides.  In  Fort  Collins,  team  members  work  on  a  variety  of  informa-
tion  gathering  methods,  including  geographic  information  systems  (GIS),  spatial
analysis,  remote  sensing  and  image  analysis,  pest  and  pathogen  modeling,  invasive
species modeling, and quantitative analysis of the impacts of forest pests.

I have worked in forest pest management and forest health for over 26 years. My
career began as a research associate in a university setting where I developed forest
pest  management  methods.  I  then  moved  to  State  government  where  I  worked  on
forest  inventory,  forest  health  monitoring,  and  forest  pest  management  for  most  of
my career. For almost five years, I have been the technology-development lead with-
in Forest Health Protection, U.S. Forest Service, as the Director of FHTET.

I  will  organize  this  testimony  along  the  lines  of  the  questions  posed  by  Sub-
committee  Chairman  Mark  Udall’s  office  in  a  letter  to  me  dated  March  26,  2008.

Questions and Answers
How  is  the  Forest  Service  using  data  collected  by  remote  sensing  tech-
nologies to identify areas of high risk for forest fires and other factors, in-
cluding  insect  infestations,  disease,  drought,  and  the  proximity  of  forests
to development that affect the health of forests in Colorado and elsewhere?
Remote  sensing  is  used  at  three  principal  scales  within  the  agency  by  both

wildland fire and the forest health protection programs of the Forest Service.

Broad Scale

Our  current  data-collection  methodologies  for  national  insect  and  disease  assess-
ments  rely  heavily  upon  aerial  sketch-mapping  surveys.  These  surveys  are  accom-
plished by aerial observers flying in light aircraft who sketch observations on paper
or  on  pen-based  portable  computers.  Though  somewhat  limited  in  spatial  accuracy,
this  very  low-cost  survey  provides  a  quick  and  timely  assessment  for  many  insect
and  disease  events.  This  ‘‘low  tech’’  approach  of  information  acquisition  is  truly  an
‘‘appropriate technology’’ for strategic regional and national assessments and is par-
ticularly  well-suited  for  trend  analysis.  Digital  sketch  mapping  uses  a  moving  map
display on which the observer marks the screen instead of marking on paper maps.
This  saves  time  in  processing  finished  maps  and  improves  location  accuracy.  We
continually strive to improve the collection of these data and have implemented dig-
ital  aerial  sketch  mapping  systems  to  improve  the  quality  and  timeliness  of  these
data sets.

Imagery  collected  at  the  broad  scale  also  includes  satellite  images  from  the  Na-
tional  Aeronautic  and  Space  Administration  (NASA)  and  National  Oceanographic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Geostationary Operational Environmental
Satellites  (GOES)  and  Polar-orbiting  Operational  Environmental  Satellites  (POES)
to support domestic forestry and fire programs.

The  Moderate  Resolution  Imaging  Spectroradiometer  (MODIS)  provides  250m-,
500m-  and  1km-resolution  spatial  detail.  MODIS  is  used  to  detect  and  monitor
wildland  fires,  assist  incident  coordination,  and  to  portray  the  fire  situation  to  the
public. MODIS is utilized with other geospatial layers and forest inventory informa-
tion to produce large-area forest cover-type and biomass maps. These maps are used
in  national  assessments  and  are  designed  for  strategic  assessments.  For  example,
a  cover  map  for  all  of  America’s  private  and  public  forests  was  recently  completed
by combining multi-resolution imagery from MODIS and Landsat with ground data
from the Forest Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program. Much of this
work  is  a  continuation  of  interagency  cooperative  research  and  development  activi-
ties spawned by the Multi-Resource Land Cover (MRLC) Consortium led by the De-
partment of the Interior’s Geological Survey. We are also applying these broad-scale
synoptic  mapping  technologies  to  develop  early  warning  systems  and  to  produce
very  large  area  damage  maps.  We  hope  to  be  able  to  post  forest  disturbance  maps
on  the  web  in  near-real-time  to  guide  our  aerial  surveys.  The  goal  here  is  to  aug-
ment  and  optimize  aerial  sketch  mapping  surveys  (by  providing  near  real  time  for-
est disturbance information to our aerial surveyors) that provide us with the major-
ity of our national damage trend information.

Mid Scale

Mid-scale imagery such as Landsat, which is 30 meter resolution and is used with
geospatial  data  and  forest  inventory  information  to  produce  individual  tree  species
maps  depicting  the  tree  layers  that  host  insect  and  diseases.  These  maps  will  be
used in the production of national risk maps. Mid-scale imagery is a significant ac-
tivity in the FHTET Fort Collins office as we are preparing the development of na-
tional  host  models  to  be  used  in  the  next  development  of  the  National  Insect  and
Disease Risk Map, a five-year strategic assessment produced by Forest Health Pro-
tection.  The  19-state,  mid-scale  hazard  assessment  for  the  Southern  Pine  Beetle
Prevention  Program  is  a  good  example  of  how  this  technology  is  currently  being
used.

Landsat also provides the predominant mid-scale imagery driving the LANDFIRE
project.  LANDFIRE  is  a  five-year,  multi-partner  project  that  produces  consistent
and comprehensive maps and data describing wildland fuels and fire regimes across
the United States. It is a shared project of the U.S. Forest Service and the Depart-
ment  of  the  Interior.  The  data  products  from  LANDFIRE  include  layers  for  vegeta-
tion  composition  and  structure,  surface  and  canopy  fuel  characteristics,  and  histor-
ical  fire  regimes.  LANDFIRE  national  methodologies  are  science-based  and  include
extensive  field-referenced  data.  LANDFIRE  data  products  are  designed  to  facilitate
national  and  regional  level  strategic  planning  and  reporting  of  wildland  fire  man-
agement activities.

LANDFIRE  data  products  are  created  at  a  30-meter  resolution  data  set.
LANDFIRE information is produced at scales that may be useful for prioritizing and
planning  hazardous  fuel  reduction  and  ecosystem  restoration  projects.  LANDFIRE
meets  agency  and  partner  needs  for  data  to  support  large  landscape,  fire  manage-
ment planning and prioritization.

Satellite imagery is likewise used for the burned area emergency response (BAER)
program for developing a burn intensity index to guide on-the-ground rehabilitation
efforts.  Landsat,  ASTER  (Advanced  Space-borne  Thermal  Emission  and  Reflection
Radiometer) and an increasing amount of commercial satellite imagery (such as Ad-
vanced  Wide-Field  sensor  (AWiFS) )  are  being  used  to  provide  BAER  teams  with
rapid assessment burn severity map products.

Landsat has also been used repeatedly within the agency in various change-detec-
tion  analyses.  One  such  notable  effort  is  the  U.S.  Forest  Service  Land  Cover  Map-
ping  and  Monitoring  Program  (LCMMP)  in  California,  which  addresses  statewide
vegetation mapping and long-term monitoring using remotely sensed data. Remotely
sensed data and GIS are used to generate maps that describe the extent and condi-
tion  of  various  land  cover  types  and  the  magnitude  and  cause  (e.g.,  urbanization,
natural succession, wildfire, and timber harvest) of land cover changes. The LCMMP
provides  a  single,  consistent  source  of  current  land  cover  data  from  which  the  U.S.
Forest  Service  and  California  Department  of  Forestry  (as  well  as  other  interested
Federal,  State,  and  local  governments  and  private  citizens)  can  make  informed  re-
source management decisions. The LCMMP is a collaborative approach to land cover
mapping  and  monitoring  that  includes  coordinated  acquisition  of  resource  photog-
raphy,  satellite  imagery,  and  geo-processing  on  a  five-year  cycle.  Regionally,  moni-
toring can identify critical causes of change or provide an early warning system for
habitats  being  degraded.  Locally,  monitoring  can  assess  county  land  use  policies,
identify areas of insects or disease problems, or assess the extent of timber harvest
in a watershed.

Fine Scale

34

Aerial  imagery  is  utilized  to  aid  in  the  mapping  of  forest  stands  and  damaged
areas  at  a  fine  scale  and  is  used  routinely  for  forest  inventory  and  local  resource
assessments.  The  U.S.  Forest  Service  participates  in  the  USDA  National  Agricul-
tural  Imagery  Program  (NAIP),  which  collects  one-meter  digital  imagery  on  a  five-
year  recurring  basis.  This  imagery  is  used  in  mapping  various  resource  conditions.
Other  than  its  use  as  an  important  mapping  aid,  NAIP’s  ability  to  determine  re-
source  conditions  for  fuel  loading  and  forest  mortality  is  very  limited.  For  project-
level  planning,  finer  resolution  imagery  is  required  to  achieve  the  desired  assess-
ment of forest resource conditions.

Forest  Service  and  other  cooperating  field  units  often  utilize  digital  high-resolu-
tion satellite imagery for local forest resource assessments. An example is a spruce-
beetle  mapping  effort  conducted  in  the  early  2000s  using  one-meter  and  0.6-meter
satellite  data.  Dead  trees  were  discernible  in  both  resolutions  of  imagery;  however,
recently  dead  or  dying  trees  (known  as  faders)  were  not  discernible  in  the  coarser
one-meter imagery. To guide many insect and disease mitigation measures, the loca-
tion  and  number  of  faders  are  needed.  In  addition  to  the  identification  of  faders,
identification  of  tree  species  and  sub-canopy  is  often  needed,  and  imagery  with  a
resolution  finer  than  0.6  meters  is  required  for  these  determinations.  The  imagery
resolution of choice from our field practitioners is in the six-inch to one-foot spatial-
resolution range. As of this moment, airborne imagery, usually photography (as op-
posed  to  satellite  imagery)  remains  the  imagery  of  choice  for  most  field  foresters.
The  Research  &  Development  arm  of  the  Forest  Service  has  been  experimenting
for several years with using Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensors. Similar
to radar but using a laser instead of radio waves, LIDAR provides very high resolu-
tion  images.  Researchers  are  combining  LIDAR  with  very  accurate  Global  Posi-
tioning  System  (GPS)  data  to  map  stream  channels,  including  pools,  riffles,  and
down woody material that are essential to understanding the health of aquatic habi-
tats,  and  forest  canopies.  LIDAR  imagery  can  see  beneath  the  over  story,  allowing
researchers to map under story plants and help detect places where trees have been
removed, such as through thinning operations.

Pre-visual detection of stress on individual trees is currently a major focus for for-
est health remote sensing specialists. In order to intervene early in a pest outbreak
scenario,  early  indications  of  pest  infestation—such  as  tree  health  at  the  edges  of
known  infestations—are  important.  This  is  especially  true  for  exotic  invasive  spe-
cies.  Unfortunately,  at  the  present  time  we  do  not  have  a  mature  repeatable  tech-
nology to fulfill this need. Hyper-spectral data for host mapping or tree health map-
ping  has  the  potential  to  fulfill  this  need,  though  at  the  present  time  results  are
inconsistent. Alternatively, field surveys can be conducted to map positive detections
and  to  identify  pest.  The  surveys  are  conducted  with  global  positioning  system
(GPS)  coordinates  and  tree  health  ratings.  However,  early  infestations  are  often
missed during field survey as damaged trees initially are characterized by very sub-
tle changes in the tree canopy. Trees stress signs, while present, often go undetected
until  they  become  obvious  to  the  field  specialist  on-the-ground.  Hyper-spectral  im-
agery has been utilized by the Forest Service for limited developmental projects for
stress-detection,  and  its  use  may  be  increased  as  the  technology  development  pro-
gresses.

Proximity of Forests to Development that May Effect Forest Health

Urban and suburban growth has resulted in the development of an outlying met-
ropolitan  fringe  that  extends  into  rural  areas  with  attractive  recreational  and  aes-
thetic  amenities.  This  is  especially  true  for  urban  growth  near  forests.  This  land-
use change has significant implications for wildfire and pest management. The WUI
creates an environment with an increased likelihood that wildfires or pest outbreaks
will threaten structures, trees around homes, recreation sites, and people. The spa-
tial  extent  and  location  and,  most  importantly,  the  growth  of  urban  and  suburban
areas  are  information  that  is  sought  by  nearly  all  sectors  of  the  natural  resource
management community.

A  myriad  of  geospatial  technologies—including  geospatial  modeling  of  census
data, the ‘‘city lights’’ data set from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-
tration’s  National  Geophysical  Data  Center  (NOAA/NGDC),  and  virtually  all  other
remote  sensing  platforms  mentioned  thus  far—are  used  to  conduct  analysis  of  the
WUI  at  different  spatial  and  temporal  scales.  This  is  typically  done  on  a  project-
by-project basis with the structure density threshold varying accordingly.

Development Efforts and Refinement

35

The Forest Service has long used various remote-sensing methods to assess forest
health and detect damage, and continuously investigates new technologies as a stra-
tegic  and  tactical  aid  to  natural  resources  management.  There  are  advantages  and
disadvantages  to  all  such  geospatial  technologies.  It  is  imperative  that  the  right
platform,  imagery,  and  analysis  be  matched  to  the  specific  problems  that  natural
resource  professionals  face.  Remote  sensing  technologies  have  extended  the  ability
of resource specialists to assess forest conditions, and these technologies are increas-
ingly being used at various spatial and temporal scales to address natural resource
management questions.

The  future  possibilities  of  ‘‘fusing’’  data  from  satellites  with  airborne  LIDAR  im-
agery and precise GPS coordinates offer great future potential for developing better
maps  in  the  future.  In  particular,  the  ability  of  LIDAR  to  create  three-dimensional
images  of  forest  stand  conditions  instead  of  just  the  flat  overhead  look  from  sat-
ellites offers substantial promise for improving natural resource management.

Data acquisition and analysis in any form still requires a considerable investment
of resources and expertise. The Forest Service continues to improve its suite of hard-
ware  and  software  tools  for  processing  and  analyzing  remotely  sensed  data.  Most
national  forest  field  offices  now  have  such  hardware  and  software,  and  are  improv-
ing  their  expertise  in  using  GIS  or  image  analysis  software  to  process  and  analyze
geospatial data sets. Land managers are also improving in their ability to select ap-
propriate remote sensing technologies to address their data needs, and they are sup-
ported  by  technology  transfer  efforts  of  the  Remote  Sensing  Applications  Center
(RSAC), the Geospatial Technologies Service center (GSTC), and FHTET.
What  are  the  benefits  of  using  remote  sensing  data  over  data  that  are  ac-
quired by other techniques?

Remote  sensing  methods  are  effective  tools  to  assess  fire,  forest  pest  and  forest
conditions.  One  of  the  benefits  of  using  remote  sensing  data  over  data  acquired  by
other techniques (for example, aerial survey and ground survey) is the spatial preci-
sion which allows for the analysis of other resource concerns, including the presence
and distribution of threatened and endangered species or the occurrence of multiple
threats  through  time.  Also,  ground  surveys  are  often  not  cost-effective  over  very
large areas. Another benefit of remote sensing lies in its consistency and objectivity;
the data do not pass through the subjective filter of a human observer before being
recorded. Compared with a ground survey, once collected, remotely sensed data can
be  easier  to  process  and  analyze,  can  cover  more  ground,  and  thereby  reduce  anal-
ysis time and improve overall planning productivity.
What, if any, are the challenges and impediments to the use of remote sens-
ing data for these and other applications, and what are your recommenda-
tions for overcoming those barriers?

Performing remote sensing data analysis requires a wide-range of skill sets, from
basic repetitive tasks to high-end analytical support. A typical field user of remotely
sensed  data  needs  to  perform  the  full  spectrum  of  skills  from  basic  through  ad-
vanced.  Often,  the  skill-level  for  the  advanced  use  of  remote  sensing  technologies
is very limited at the field level, though regional offices and national service centers
can and do provide support for individual projects.

Basic  tasks  for  the  analysis  of  remotely  sensed  data  are  usually  performed  by
technician-level employees. This capability has diminished over the last few decades
as the workforce has shifted from technician-level employees to professional and ad-
ministrative  employees.  Often,  a  field  unit  is  left  with  little  or  no  support  for  basic
remote  sensing  processing—a  field  staff  officer  may  be  doing  the  work  of  a  field
technician due to staffing limitations. As these remote sensing skills evolve through
workforce  evolution,  skill  sets  must  continue  to  improve  for  the  utility  of  remotely
sensed data to increase. The national service centers for remote sensing applications
(RSAC),  geometronics  (GSTC)  and  forest  health  (FHTET)  are  all  working  on  tech-
nology  transfer  efforts  to  develop  field  ready  methodologies,  and  improve  workforce
skills to meet today’s needs.

The  early  signatures  of  most  forest  pests  are  ephemeral  and  the  timing  of  data
acquisition is another important challenge. Imagery must be acquired during the pe-
riod  of  time  during  which  pest  damage  signatures  are  most  visible  or  when  the  in-
formation  best  supports  managerial  action.  This  is  very  often  a  very  brief  period,
sometimes  less  than  two  to  three  weeks.  Imagery  acquisition  during  this  ‘‘bio-win-
dow’’  is  difficult  in  some  parts  of  the  country  due  to  imagery  acquisition  schedules
and  the  lack  of  suitable  weather  without  clouds.  Also,  the  effectiveness  of  on-the-
ground  treatments  for  a  given  forest  health  concern  involve  data  timing  consider-
ations.  Results  from  image  analysis  must  be  timely  in  order  to  facilitate  time-sen-

sitive  on-the-ground  treatments.  Remotely  sensed  data  need  to  be  collected,  proc-
essed,  and  evaluated  within  a  given  timeframe  so  that  the  forest  health  concern  is
observed and a response can be formulated and performed in a timely manner. For
tactical on-the-ground operations, the required turn-around time of imagery acquisi-
tion, image analysis, and treatment prescription often exceeds the biological window
available for the treatment to be effective.

Shortening  the  time  to  analyze  remotely  sensed  imagery  would  significantly  aid
in the practical implementation of remote sensing in the U.S. Forest Service. Efforts
to develop ways to reduce this time could be accomplished through close cooperation
of  remote  sensing  commercial  interests,  researchers,  field  resource  specialists,  and
the technology development community within the U.S. Forest Service.
What  remote  sensing  data,  products  or  services,  or  supporting  infrastruc-
ture would be most valuable for expanding the use of remote sensing data
in the future?

The  key  to  providing  continued  support  for  the  mid-scale  mapping  and  on-going
forest  condition  monitoring  is  Landsat.  Continued  availability  allows  for  the  com-
parison of current conditions with reference conditions collected by previous Landsat
sensors  to  identify  changes  and  trends  in  forest  canopy,  including  the  new  chal-
lenges  associated  with  global  climate  change.  Landsat  imagery  has  been  a  signifi-
cant component within our natural resource information programs. Trends detected
through  such  an  approach  will  yield  insightful  information  which  otherwise  would
not be detected through other monitoring techniques.

In  order  for  high-resolution  satellite  imagery  to  be  more  routinely  used,  it  must
achieve  finer  resolution  and  be  cost-competitive  with  aerial  photography.  Higher
resolution  remotely  sensed  data  (airborne  or  satellite)  can  be  utilized  when  deter-
mined to be cost-effective for the extent of coverage needed. Often, a project’s spatial
extent  exceeds  the  practical  capability  available  given  the  small  image  ‘‘footprint’’
of various sensors. Also, the cost of high-resolution satellite imagery must match the
project area and not be cost-prohibitive. Lower-cost imagery (assuming useful inter-
pretation)  would  ultimately  yield  better,  more  frequent  monitoring  of  our  forest  re-
sources.

The  development  of  automated  routines  for  preparing  and  interpreting  imagery
would help to shorten the turn-around time between imagery acquisition and treat-
ments.  This  can  help  reduce  the  need  for  basic  interpretive  skills  and  improve  the
timeliness  for  deriving  analytical  information.  Professional  field  specialists  could
then  better  focus  on  problem-solving,  for  which  they  are  most  skilled:  that  is  to
make natural resource decisions.

Image  interpretation  relies  upon  assigning  certain  characteristics,  such  as  tree
species,  to  specific  parts  of  the  image-a  process  called  classification.  Building  accu-
rate  automated  routines  to  classify  an  image  requires  sufficient  data  from  ground
plots to validate the classification routines.

Conclusion

The  USDA  Forest  Service  utilizes  remote  sensing  and  other  geospatial  tech-
nologies  routinely  to  measure  resource  conditions.  This  is  done  both  to  assess  cur-
rent  conditions  and  to  predict  future  conditions.  Assessments  range  from  the  stra-
tegic  to  the  tactical  and  utilize  imagery  from  a  broad  scale  to  a  fine  scale.  Remote
sensing technologies range from analog photography (true color or color infrared) to
the  latest  in  hyperspectral  imagery.  Acquisition  platforms  range  from  government-
owned  systems  to  commercial  systems.  The  agency  maintains  an  active  technology
development effort and continually tries to fit the task at hand with the various re-
mote  sensing  methodologies  available.  Sensor  capabilities  (spectral,  spatial,  tem-
poral,  and  cost)  must  be  carefully  tailored  to  the  project;  if  a  match  can  be  made,
the  Forest  Service  will  likely  use  that  technology  in  their  resource  assessment  ef-
forts.

Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement. I would be happy to answer

any questions you or other Members of the Subcommittee may have.

DISCUSSION

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, panel, and we want to move right
to  a  round  of  questions,  and  I  will  recognize  myself  for  five  min-
utes. I want to ask a very basic question, and each one of you have
spoken  here,  but  I  wanted  to  give  you  a  chance  to  underline  the
importance of this data.

What  makes  the  use  of  remote  sensing  worthwhile  for  what  you

and your organization do?

I  want  to  start  with  Mr.  Byers,  and  we’ll  go  on  with  Dr.
Montagu.  Byers  is  a  very  well-known  Colorado  name.  Are  you  re-
lated  to  former  Governor  Byers  and  the  town  of  Byers  and  all  the
other?

Mr.  BYERS.  I  would  like  to  say  yes,  but  I’m  not  sure  that  I  am.
You  know,  I  try  not  to  say  that  too  often,  so  that  folks—I’m  very
proud  of  what  the  Byers  family  did  in  Colorado,  even  if  they
weren’t directly related to me. I’m sure there’s something there.

Chairman UDALL. I’m sure you are. Middle Park in Grand Coun-
ty, which I represent is one of the most beautiful landmarks, Byers
Peak, which draws the eye immediately when you come up over the
pass.

Having gone off on a bit of a tangent, Mr. Byers, tell us how re-
mote  sensing  data  makes  what  you  do  worthwhile  for  you  in  your
organization.

Mr. BYERS. That’s all right, Mr. Chairman. I think you have the

license to do that when you choose.

This  actually  is—it  is  very  serious  to  us  because,  as  you  know,
many of the State agencies are limited in funding here in Colorado.
We  have  a  number  of  legislative  initiatives  that  have  kept  our
growth of our budget to a limited area. The real value that we have
is that we get a great deal of data, very specific and high-resolution
data.  It  allows  us  to  spend  less  time  ground  truthing  information,
allows  us  to  use  less  public  funds  in  the  general  administration  of
water  rights  for  us,  primarily,  and  I’m  speaking  of  the  Landsat
technology that I spoke of earlier.

The  other  aspect  of  it  is,  is  that  we  tie  into  all  of  this.  I  act  as
the  emergency  manager  within  our  department  and  a  number  of
other  things.  We  tie  into  all  of  this  other  technology,  and  all  of  it
saves us time, effort, and gives us better information faster, and al-
lows us to respond to the public’s needs better. With that, I’ll stop.

Chairman UDALL. Dr. Montagu.
Dr.  MONTAGU.  I  want  to  focus  on  one  specific  technology,  and
mainly  aerial—digital  aerial  photography.  Obviously,  the  Denver
metro  area  is  growing  significantly  and  has  been  now  for  over  a
decade.  We’re  adding  about  20,000  households  a  year.  I  may  get
that wrong.

38

The  overall  growth  of  the  metro  area,  you  know,  trying  to  plan
for that and manage it so that we can put in the long range infra-
structure  requires  that  we  have  some  sense  of  where  this  growth
is  happening,  and  also  develop  some  policies  that  hopefully  direct
some of the growth and match the infrastructure that we’re trying
to build.

Aerial  photography  is  critical  for  that,  particularly,  number  one,
knowing  where  that  growth  is  happening,  but  also  for  change  de-
tection, being able to look back and forth through time to see where
that  growth  is.  So  it’s  vitally  important  to  us  that  we  keep  that
going.

We have formulated our own approach to that, which is this pub-
lic/private  partnership  that  we  have  going.  We  have  30  different
agencies  working  collectively  to  acquire  this  imagery  together.  I’m
pleased to say that both the State of Colorado and the USGS have
partnered with us on that, developing that together collectively.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you. I’ll let the record note that I prefer

DRCOG as the acronym.

Mr. Navarro, please.
Mr. NAVARRO. Thank you.
The value, obviously, is being able to get to the location with the
centerline  data  that  geospatial  imagery  gives  us.  But  leveraging
that technology to also be able to layer for those response agencies
on  specifically  what  it  is  they’re  looking  at,  to  get  a  specific  ad-
dress, then we know what’s in the building, or have a full deck on
final analysis that geospatial creation will provide.

Now,  the  other  aspect  of  that  interface  is  that  any  fire  profes-
sional  will  tell  you  that  weather  is  the  major  factor.  But  then  you
have  to  layer  in  slope  and  terrain  in  the  location  where  you’ll  be
able  to  get  good,  accurate  information  relative  to  that  vegetation
layer when you get there, because oftentimes these teams will come
in  from  across  the  country,  and  it’s  vitally  important  to  the  safety
of mitigation.

Chairman UDALL. Mr. Sapio.
Mr.  SAPIO.  Remote  sensing  methods  are  effective  tools  to  assess
fire,  forest  pest  and  forest  conditions.  One  of  the  benefits  of  using
remote sensing data over other techniques (for example, aerial sur-
vey and ground survey) is the spatial precision which allows for the
analysis of other resource concerns. Another benefit of remote sens-
ing  lies  in  its  consistency  and  objectivity;  the  data  do  not  pass
through  a  subjective  filter  of  a  human  observer  before  being  re-
corded. Remote sensing data can be easier to process, analyze, and
covers  more  ground,  reduces  analysis  time,  and  improves  overall
planning productivity.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you.
At  this  time  I  want  to  recognize  our  Ranking  Member,  Mr.

Feeney, for his questions.

Mr. FEENEY. Well, thank you to all of our witnesses. I think Mr.
Byers suggested that there may be a gap should Landsat 5 or 7 fail
prior to launch of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission in 2011. If
that gap occurs, how much of a problem will it be for what you do,
and some of the other witnesses, and can that gap be mitigated by
surveillance, airborne surveillance assistance, if we’re going to have
a gap.

39

Mr. BYERS. Thank you, Mr. Feeney.
Mr. FEENEY. Bring that closer.
Mr.  BYERS.  Our  view,  as  we  look  at  this  collectively  with  the
western states as well as within Colorado is that, yes, there are op-
portunities  for  us  to  cover  the  gap.  But  the  costs  and  the  efforts
associated with that are detrimental to the overall well-being of the
public.  We  have  the  opportunity  here  to  assure  continuity,  and  an
efficient and effective way to do that, should we have a gap, should
we have a problem.

We  believe  one,  we’ve  wasted  the  opportunity  that  is  presented
in front of us to get this sensing instrument up in space. The other
one  is  that  the  next  time  we’re  able  to  do  that  is  considerably  far-
ther  down  the  road,  and  the  expense  to  all  of  the  public  agencies
is going to be extreme. And the problems we have facing us in the
west with climate change, and just all of the land and water issues.
Water  here  in  the  west  is  so  valuable  and  so  critical  to  life.  When
I  worked  with  the  tribes,  water  is  life,  and  that’s  how  they  would
explain  it.  And  that’s  how  it  is  here  in  the  west.  And  that’s  why
it  was  so  important  to  us  to  see  how—see  all  of  this  information
so that we can manage our water resources collectively in the best
way possible.

Mr.  FEENEY.  Anybody  have  anything  to  add  to  that?  Mr.  Sapio.
Mr.  SAPIO.  The  Landsat  program  has  been  a  real  workhorse  in
monitoring  vegetation  and  vegetation  change.  Landsat  5  and
Landsat 7 are operating well, well beyond their design lifetime.

Landsat continuity is key to providing support for mid-scale map-
ping  for  forest  services,  to  monitor  ongoing  conditions,  and  to  ad-
dress  new  challenges  associated  with  drastic  forest  changes  that
we’re seeing here in Colorado.

Landsat  or  other  Landsat  sensors  will  also  be  useful  in  evalu-
ating  vegetation  changes  in  climate.  Continued  availability  of  this
kind  of  imagery,  the  short  wave,  red  band  in  particular,  allows  a
comparison  of  current  conditions  with  reference  conditions  already
provided by thousands of previous Landsat collections. An example
of this would be the Aspen incline in the west of Colorado.

Mr. FEENEY. Thank you. I have an interest in, given the capabili-
ties  of  this  optical  scanning  equipment,  whether  privacy  issues
have  been  raised  and  to  what  extent,  and  to  where—I  don’t  know
for  those  over  here  or  in  California,  but  in  Florida  we  have  sun-
shine  laws  that  virtually  aid  in  protecting  the  public.  Ongoing
criminal investigations, for example, are totally accessible with few
exceptions to the public, to the press.

And so how do you deal with privacy, and are there concerns, for
example,  with  tourists,  or  evildoers  would  get,  you  know,  whether
it’s a nuclear plant or whatever it is, to get access to some informa-
tion  that  would  be  useful  in  doing  harm?  You  know,  technology  is
morally neutral.

It  can  be  used  for  good  or  evil,  and  I  want  to  know  to  what  ex-

tent you folks have dealt with those questions.

Mr.  BYERS.  Thank  you,  Congressman.  We  have—we  certainly,
from  a  water  management  standpoint,  believe  that  the  trans-
parency is important. We think that California ought to know what
Colorado  is  doing,  and  we  certainly  would  like  to  know  what  Cali-
fornia  is  doing  with  our  water,  tongue  in  cheek  there  a  little  bit.

We  think  that’s  a  good  thing,  and  here  the  Colorado,  we  do  have
open records and such.

However,  as  I’ve  mentioned,  I  work  several  hats.  I  also  sit  on  a
government coordinating council with the Department of Homeland
Security  for  dam  security.  And  we  are  very  concerned  about  how
much  of  this  aerial  information  is  available.  But  the  fact  of  it  is
that  most  of  the  location  information  is  already  out  there.  We  do
a  very  good  job  of  looking  at  how  to  deal  with  security  issues  on
individual structures and regional areas.

Like,  for  example,  we  will  look  at  how  all  of  the  infrastructure
and  protection  of  the  infrastructure  with  the  Democratic  National
Convention  coming  here  in  Denver.  We’ve  already  started  much  of
that work. We also do it all across the U.S. as a national look. We
watch carefully from Colorado to look at who’s asking for the infor-
mation  so  that  we  can  provide  that  information  to  the  appropriate
authorities.

But as far as the transparency of the information, we don’t view
that  as  a  problem.  Transparency  is  a  good  thing.  Folks  knowing
what  kind  of  crop  issues,  how  water  is  managed,  what  climate
change  issues  to  look  at,  topography,  all  of  that  stuff  we  think  is
a good thing.

We think it has, actually, very good application to the southwest
with the recent drought and some of the issues they’ve had to deal
with.  We  think  it  has  great  application  there,  and  I’m  sure  it  is
used.

Dr. MONTAGU. It’s a very critical issue in terms of all of this data
that  is  available  now.  And  I  know  it’s  a  subject  of  conversation
across  this  consortium  that  we  have—like  I  said,  we  have  30  dif-
ferent  local  governments,  utility  companies,  and  some  members  of
private  sector  all  getting  access  to  this  data,  and  we  talk  a  lot
about the privacy concerns of it.

I  think  Mr.  Byers  is  right.  It  is  a  transparency  question  in  the
sense  of  the  public  value  that  comes  from  it,  from  its  dispersion  is
more important than the potential for nefarious use down the road.
And  the  fact  of  the  matter  is,  there’s  so  much  of  this  data  out  in
the  public  domain  now,  that  the  ability  to  stop  it  at  this  point  in
time would be very difficult.

That  said,  though,  I  know  that  all  of  our  member  governments
treat this data very carefully, and it’s—you know, the security that
goes  with  all  of  those  sorts  of  things,  that’s  something  we  all  take
seriously to make sure it doesn’t end up places we don’t want it to.
And  we  do  have  tracking  systems  that  go  through  a  process  that
tracks where this data is going.

Mr. NAVARRO. That’s a great question there. We’ve wrestled with
that  internally,  officers  at  our  command  in  that  part  from  south
central  region  that  individually  facilitate  that  within  that  office.
We  have  a  grant  from  Federal  Government  for  planning  for  ter-
rorist  responses.  We  use  a  tremendous  amount  of  GIS  information
and  we  share  that  with  our  partners.  So  we’ve  been  very  careful,
relative  to  those  agreements  within  in  our  group  on  how  the  data
is  used  and  how  it’s  shared.  But  the  reality  is  some  of  that  data
is public data.

I  think,  if  we  look  at  it  as  the  data  is  a  tool,  which  individuals
can  get  access  to,  how  we  plan  based  on  that  data  is  really  more

sensitive to us, rather than just the data itself. It’s the great thing
about living in America, and the lousy thing about living here.

Mr.  SAPIO.  In  my  experience,  I  hear  a  lot  about  this,  but  I
haven’t run into any practical situations where it’s been a problem
for us in the Forest Service. The nature of collecting the data over
remote forest areas, we’re not collecting overseas. The data is com-
mercially  available,  and  it’s  available  in  the  public  domain.  We’re
bound  as  federal  employees  to  protect  personal  identifiable  infor-
mation,  and  trying  to  do  so.  So  if  there  were  a  situation  for  that
to  arise,  I  would  imagine  we  would  find  a  way  to  work  around  it.
Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Chairman, I’m way over my time. But if I could
just  note  that,  again,  technology  is  morally  neutral,  and  a  lot  of  it
is already out there. But for example, somebody that wanted to do
a  lot  of  harm  could  look  at  the  dryness  patterns  and  which  way  a
wildfire  was  likely  to  grow.  Somebody  would  know  where  to  drop
most  of  the  poison  if  they  wanted  to  do  harm.  And  you  can  go  on
the  web  site  and  punch  in  my  address  and  get  a  360  circular  pic-
ture  of  my  home  and  anybody  that  wants  to  break  in  a  home.  So
it  is  scary.  I  don’t  know  what  the  answer  is,  but  I  thought  it  was
an important question.

Chairman  UDALL.  I  think  that’s  a  very  important  question.  I
think  it  was  an  important  discussion  and  we  ought  to  continue  it.
And there’s obviously more we need to understand.

We’re  going  to  do  a  second  round  of  questions,  and  I  would  like
to come back to the four of you and ask you what opportunities you
foresee for the expanded application of remote sensing to your work
and  what’s  needed  to  realize  those  opportunities.  I  know  some  of
you  have  spoken  about  that  with  Landsat  and  other  technologies,
but  please  take—if  you  had  a  wand,  what  else  would  you  like  me
to do?

Mr. BYERS. If I had a wand, I’d like to know what the snow pack
is  going  to  be  next  year  this  year.  That  is  what  I’d  really  like  to
know. And speaking of snow pack, some of the opportunity that we
see  is  with  our  evaluation  of  the  snow  water  equivalents  and  the
distribution of snow pack in the State of Colorado.

We have certainly—currently working on a snow program, which
is  a  cooperative  program  with  several  federal  entities  as  well  as
several  entities  within  State  government.  And  one  of  the  things
that we look at is trying to have a better—because that water sup-
ply  is  so  important  to  us,  as  well  as  the  rest  of  the  west,  is  trying
to look at how do we get a better handle on what’s there and what
kind of distribution, what kind of timing we’ll have with respect to
runoff.  Of  course,  again,  all  of  what  has  been  discussed  today  is
very  important  to  the  State.  We’ve  focused  a  little  bit  on  water  in
the Subcommittee hearing, and we appreciate the opportunity to do
that.

Dr. MONTAGU. My crystal ball would have the tools and the proc-
esses  in  place  to  start  to  integrate  a  lot  of  this  data  together.  We
have  collected  a  lot  of  stuff  over  many  decades  now  that  we  typi-
cally  tend  to  use  for  specific  applications.  But  in  reality,  we  can
start  to  look  at  our  urban  and  our  rural  environments  much  more
holistically. We can start to blend some of these data sets together.
Understanding  the  health  of  urban  vegetation,  for  example,  is
very  important  for  understanding  the  impacts  of  climate  change

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 041573 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA08\040708\41573 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

42

and  the  likely  heat  effects  that  happen  in  urban  environments.  So
being able to draw some of that information together with some of
the long-range plans that we’re producing will allow us to leverage
this information much more efficiently going forward.

Chairman UDALL. Is that a function of software? Is it a function
of the digital resources to bring those data sets in closer proximity.
Dr.  MONTAGU.  I  think  it’s  a  function  of  a  whole  range  of  things.
One  is  starting  to  draw  expertise  together  to  say  we  need  to  look
at this more closely. The other one is starting to rethink a little bit
about how we use this data. So we put up these sensors for a spe-
cific purpose when, in fact, we could be saying we need to be more
holistically  looking  at  the  number  of  different  applications  we  can
use it for.

Mr. NAVARRO. You know, I was very interested in comments just
made,  because  it’s  really  the  page  that  we’re  opening  up  recently
in Washington, talking with some of the representatives from DHS
from the standards and technology group and the data group.

The  fire  service  itself,  I’m  on  an  advisory  committee,  and  we’re
trying  to  formulate  a  standard  by  which  we  produce  this  data  and
use  this  data.  One  of  the  conversations  we  had,  relative  to  that,
was what’s the output? What is that going to look like? What’s the
utility  of  using  that  particular  data?  But  on  the  long  view  of  that,
from my standpoint, from leadership in the fire service, is we have
to  start  educating  the  fire  service  itself  and  the  technology  that’s
there  and  how  that’s  going  to  be  used.  Bring  it  to  that  leadership,
whether  it’s  the  city  manager,  or  mayor,  or  local  fire  chief,  how
does that get used in a holistic fashion?

That’s going to be a very interesting migration as we go forward.
Chairman  UDALL.  Mr.  Navarro,  I’d  like  to  pursue  that  more  in
commentary.  As  you  know,  I’m  a  homer.  I  talk  a  lot  about  what
you  all  have  done  down  here.  At  the  risk  of  getting  you  in  a  little
bit  of  trouble  with  your  fellow  fire  chiefs,  how  many  other  depart-
ments, how many other urban areas, how many other cities are at
the  point  you  all  are  in  using  this  data  to  prevent  and  then  re-
spond, hopefully not necessary, but if the case does arise.

Mr.  NAVARRO.  None  that  I  know  of  to  the  extent  we’re  doing
that.  We  had  an  IT  section  in  my  administration  when  I  arrived
here  in  ’94,  but  we  do  have  a  very  large  group  that’s  been  formed
of  users.  Chief  Rector  over  in  California,  and  the  California  Fire
Service  is  very  interested  in  accumulating  this  information,  and
how it’s going to be leveraged on the other end of it. So we’re start-
ing to open up that page.

We actually hosted a meeting there two weeks ago, of the practi-
tioners,  to  try  that  standard  process,  and  the  advisory  committee
is looking at that right now. But we’ve got a ways to go. We’ve got
to  catch  up  with  what  DOD  has  been  doing  for  years  in  terms  of
situations  where—much  the  same,  our  warriors  are  in  the  field
doing something a little bit different.

Chairman UDALL. I was on the Elk Meadow fire that same sum-
mer we had the Hayman fire. Supervisor Cables was there, Mr. Ca-
bles,  and  he  said,  Mark,  the  best  analog  here  is  to  fight  another
war.  This  is  a  war-like  environment,  realtime  situation.  So  your
analogy, as well, makes real sense, Chief Navarro. So I’d like to get
a breakdown of what you’re doing.

Mr.  NAVARRO.  I  encourage  you  to  do  that  as  much  as  you  can.
Chairman UDALL. Okay, thank you.
Mr. Sapio.
Mr.  SAPIO.  With  the  temporal  regulation  groups,  various  com-
mercial entities, we’re likely to use the technology more and more,
resolutions,  temporal  and  spatial.  If  there  were  more  preprocessed
imagery  routines  available  where  features  have  already  been  ex-
tracted  in  the  commercial  sector,  we’re  more  likely  to  see  casual
users  use  LIDAR  remote  sensing  imagery  so  they  don’t  have  to  go
through the training and the large amount of image prep necessary
to extract information from the imagery.

One thing that’s particularly important to my group in the Forest
Service is that if there were vegetation information available of the
city, that would be extremely useful for us to model the risks of in-
sects  and  diseases  that  could  be  introduced  at  those  industries.  So
those  are  the  things  I  can  think  of  off  the  top  of  my  head  that
would make remote sensing more useful to the Forest Service.

Chairman  UDALL.  Well,  it’s  exciting  to  hear  all  those  potential
applications,  obviously.  We  have  a  bit  of  homework  and  additional
work  to  do,  and  other  resources,  and  continue  to  work  together,
which is why I’m, to provides a lot of opportunity.

The  Chair  recognizes  the  Ranking  Member  for  another  round  of

his questions.

Mr. FEENEY. Well, thanks. You know, Mr. Navarro, talking about
the  lead  you  have  in  using  this  technology,  the—one  of  the  aerial
vehicles in California, Oregon and Washington, we have a series of
serious fires, and it would help if I got a pinpoint accuracy in terms
of what the direction of the fire was going. Obviously, this is valu-
able capabilities, even though you talk about firefighters having to
make instant decisions and how accurate the information is.

What organizations, nationally, can you use to share these capa-
bilities, and not just in fire, but maybe Dr. Montagu or Mr. Byers,
what  organization  in  city  and  local  governments  are  addressing
this in your conferences or charters?

Mr. NAVARRO. We actually are going to be on the docket for FRI
here in Denver with—and I don’t brag for myself. I’m probably the
lead  individual  in  GIS  within  our  organization.  And  what  we’re
able  to  do  is  we  had  some  very  expert  technical  advice,  married
with  some  operational  folks.  And  as  they  sat  down,  they  started  a
vision with what this technology can do. And that’s how we’ve been
able to launch some of that.

That discussion is going to be taking place at FRI. We’re looking
at what that agenda might look like to be able to convince. Because
when  you’re  talking  leadership,  they’re  very  pragmatic  about
things.  They  know  what  works  and  what  doesn’t  work.  They  don’t
want to try anything that’s not going to work for them. The obvious
kind  of  thing  is,  as  part  of  the  papers,  you  know,  we’re  impeded
by  100  years  of  tradition.  But  the  reality  is,  if  it  works,  they’re
going to start using it. We have to show the utility of that informa-
tion.

If you provide a great deal of data that’s not in a processed form,
for  someone  trying  to  make  discreet  decisions  very  quickly,  they’re
going to disregard it.

It’s  got  to  come  in  a  form  that  makes  some  sense  to  them.  The

reality is that that hasn’t happened too often.

California,  I  think,  is  a  great  example  of  what  just  occurred,  be-
cause they were given a realtime situation like this. And I can’t tell
you  how  valuable  it  would  be  to  have  that  base  layer  really  know-
ing  what  was  out  there  before,  and  then  video  from  my  global  on
what’s  happening  on  the  ground,  to  be  able  to  move  resources
around,  be  able  to  do  the  evacuations  and  do  the  other  kinds  of
things.

Those  large  fires  cannot  be  managed.  They  are  going  to  burn
until  the  weather  stops.  That’s  one  of  the  problems  for  firefighters
that’s  interesting.  We  are  subject  to  some  horrific  fire  behavior  in
this  State  if  we  don’t  do  something  about  that.  On  the  response
side  of  that,  we  can  provide  some  safety  for  those  individuals  that
are going to be doing that, in terms of either evacuation or real re-
sponse. So I hope that answers your question.

Dr.  MONTAGU.  The  key  point  to  make  about  DRCOG  is,  you
know,  we  are  a  long-range  planning  agency,  so  we  don’t  typically
deal  with  tactical  short-term  stuff.  The  need  for  realtime  informa-
tion  is  not  as  critical,  at  least  in  the  land  use.  I’ll  address  the
transportation side in a little bit.

But  one  of  the  concrete  examples  I  can  come  to  is  the  LIDAR
that  we  are  collecting  at  the  moment  for  the  Democratic  National
Convention  is  being  used  by  the  NGA  in  a  tactical  response.  So
they  want  to  know  all  of  the  planning  that  goes  with  the  security
around the convention. But that information, when it flows back to
us,  we  can  start  to  create  these  three-dimensional  models  of  the
city.

One  of  the  things  that  a  lot  of  people  struggle  with  is  trying  to
imagine what something will look like 30 years from now. So being
able to take that data and combine with the software that we have
and  create  a  vision  of  what  the  future  might  look  like  is  very  im-
portant to them.

Mr. FEENEY. Well, it’s interesting you say that, because while we
don’t  have  a  model  of  geospatial  imaging,  we  do  have  a  national
model  for  simulation.  We  make  everything  from  Tiger  Woods  golf
to  football.  My  nine-year-old  tested  it  the  other  day,  and  I  was
sworn  to  secrecy  about  what  was  in  it.  We  have  all  five  branches
of the military. We create the software there, and one of the things
we have to put together here is the geospatial stuff. It’s a great his-
tory of what’s happening now.

What  simulation  can  do  is  tell  us  what’s  going  to  happen  next,
and can train people, you know. You could run a wildfire in the of-
fices  in  front  of  computers  and  test  every  commander  in  Colorado
based  on  his  or  her  behavior  and  get  a  very  good  picture  of  that
wildfire  many  times  before  you  actually  had  to  fight  it.  And  every
one  of  them  would  be  an  A  plus  student  by  the  time  you  actually
have a real fire. It’s an interesting possibility.

I have no further questions. Thank you.
Chairman  UDALL.  I’m  going  to  hold  a  third  round  with  a  focus
on—Mr.  Feeney  has  questions,  do  it  in  10  minutes,  and  we  have
paneled  the  next  people.  But  if  I  might  have  each  one  of  you  talk
to what you think the most important role for the Federal Govern-
ment  is  in  facilitating  the  use  of  remote  sensing  data  to  support

45

both  public-  and  private-sector  activities  in  the  war-fighting  cam-
paign.

Mr.  BYERS.  First  of  all,  give  me  a  chance  to  really  think  my

thoughts through.

Chairman  UDALL.  The  next  panel  I’ll  alternate.  I  learn  as  I  go.
Mr. BYERS. With respect to the Federal Government, I think that
when  these  issues  are  beyond  an  individual  State’s  borders,  when
they are, in fact, for the public good, that that’s where the Federal
Government comes in and has a role in coordinating the acquisition
of the data, trying to work with how to utilize the data, and I think
even  through  the  education  and  exposure  of  various  tools,  of  how
to  use  and  how  to  integrate  some  of  that  data.  So  I  think  that
when it’s the overall public good, that’s where the Federal Govern-
ment comes in.

When  I  think  of  it  from  a  more  local  perspective,  obviously,  to
use  that  same  role  would  be  that  the  State  has  a  responsibility,
particularly  in  its  region  or,  for  example,  with  us  for  the  Western
States  Water  Council,  or  a  particular  technical  area,  whether  it  is
in the dam safety arena, whether it’s in the forestry arena or what-
ever, to be able to be a facilitator and focus for getting some of that
coordination  between  the  Federal  Government  and  the  local  and
the hands-on practitioner.

But  I  think  there’s  a  variety  of  roles  as  a  collaborative  effort,  a
cooperative  effort,  and  we  have  to  continue  to  stretch  each  other’s
comfort so that we are pushing the envelope. And maybe that’s the
best scenario when I talk about this being, you know, kind of space.
We do need to continue to stretch that envelope and go to new fron-
tiers.

Dr.  MONTAGU.  I  come  back  to  the  comments  that  I  made  in  my
testimony.  It  really  is  about  leadership.  The  Federal  Government
has  led  this  industry  for  a  long  period  of  time.  And  thinking  of  it
from the point of view of a local government and a regional govern-
ment, the cost not only of the direct acquisition, but also all of the
R&D  that  goes  in  behind  that  is  something  that  only  the  Federal
Government is really resourced to do.

And,  you  know,  Mr.  Byers’  comment  about  the  expanse,  the  fact
that  this  is  broad  acre  stuff  that  we’re  talking  about  here,  so  it
transcends  local,  regional,  even  State  boundaries.  So  to  have  the
federal  involvement  and  leadership  on  that  front  is  vitally  impor-
tant.

I  think  that  the  leadership  on  the  distribution  side,  the  models
that  the  Federal  Government  is  coming  up  with  now  to  push  the
stuff  out  to  people  is  very  important.  Again,  we’re  talking  about
terabytes  and  terabytes  of  information  that  none  of  us  locally  can
afford  to  store.  And  so  to  have  those  resources  distributed  across
the country and being able to tap into those is vitally important for
us.

Chairman UDALL. Chief.
Mr.  NAVARRO.  The  lead  agencies,  in  my  estimation,  on  the  fed-
eral  side  for  some  of  the  work  that  we  do  is  DHS,  FEMA  and  Na-
tional Fire Administration. And for years we really didn’t have that
support,  that  a  disaster  or  a  local  emergency  basically  was  a  local
emergency, and at some point it morphed into this other thing.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 041573 PO 00000 Frm 00049 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA08\040708\41573 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

46

I  think  back  to  the  ’60s  when  I  started,  and  we  had  actual  civil
defense  folks  working  in  fire  service  because  we  had  a  national
emergency because we thought we were going to get nuked at some
point. That went away. Now we have a national threat again.

I think that we can partner with DHS, with FEMA, and with the
National Fire Administration to alleviate some of the issues we had
in  terms  of  response  mitigation  at  a  local  level,  but  also  migrate
that to the larger level. Because it starts here and it goes to there.
We don’t have the resources at a local level to be able to do this,
whether it’s the staff, the technology, whether it’s the process piece
of  it  and  integrating  it  into  what  we  do.  And  I  think  we  need  to
see  the  leads  coming  from  the  feds  to  help  us  with  that.  But  we
have  a  common  purpose  relative  to  those  types  of  responses.  DHS
and  FEMA  do  come  in.  The  reality  that  they’re  going  to  be  inter-
facing  with  the  locals,  they  need  to  have  situational  analysis  that
we should be able to provide, and vice versa.

Chairman UDALL. Mr. Sapio.
Mr.  SAPIO.  There  are  four  things  that  come  to  mind  that  all
would  be  done  under  the  umbrella  of  both  partnership  with  other
agencies  and  commercial  entities  in  remote  sensing.  One  that’s
very important is a provision of imagery and its distribution, which
you’ve  heard  already.  The  provision  of  extracted  information  from
imagery,  like  fuel  loadings  and  pest  risk.  Thirdly,  the  provision  of
new  analytical  techniques.  This  would  be  particularly  useful  for
local  assessments,  if  we  learn  how  to  produce  some  extraction  for
a  particular  risk  factor  that’s  useful  locally.  And  fourth,  the  provi-
sion  of  models  that  project  future  resource  conditions,  and  this
would be particularly useful for planning.

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you.  I  note  that  all  of  you,  in  a  sense,
have  talked  to  the  opportunity  here  for  two-fers  or  three-fers.  And
Chief,  you  talked  about  the  civil  defense  needs  in  the  ’60s.  And
now,  in  a  sense,  history  is  repeating  itself  with  a  different  kind  of
enemy. And then the role FEMA plays in their own like self-inter-
est, and having the data they need when they’re called to be on the
ground.  I  know,  Florida,  Colorado,  Mr.  Feeney  mentioned,  have
some  similar  challenges  that  Mother  Nature  presents,  and  the  se-
verity and the intensity which they can arrive.

But  I  think  both,  at  the  time,  are  partnered  by  setting  aside
what  happened  in  New  Orleans,  that  FEMA  has  begun  to  do  a
more  preventative  analysis,  and  preventative  investments,  and  it
seems  like  a  very  smart  way  to  use  federal  dollars,  as  well  as  to
draw in the local responders.

Mr. Feeney.
Mr.  FEENEY.  I’ve  enjoyed  all  of  the  witnesses.  I  appreciate  your

testimony, and your advice. Thanks for having me today.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you for being here.
We’ll  take  a  couple  of  minutes,  and  the  next  panel  will  join  us,
and  we  look  forward  to  their  testimony.  I  know  you  all  would  be
willing  to  answer  questions  for  the  record  if  we  give  them  to  you.
Thank you.

Panel 2:

Chairman  UDALL.  The  hearing  will  return  to  order.  We  have  a
wonderful,  fascinating,  erudite  second  round  of  witnesses,  and  I’d
like to take a moment to introduce this second panel.

Kevin  Little,  he’s  the  Director  for  Business  Development  for
Intermap Technologies. To his left, Matt O’Connell who’s the Presi-
dent and Chief Executive Officer of GeoEye. And we also have with
us  Jill  Smith,  who’s  the  President  and  CEO  of  DigitalGlobe,  Inc.
Again, I want to welcome each of you, and we’ll dive right in and

start with Mr. Little and his testimony.

STATEMENT OF MR. KEVIN LITTLE, DIRECTOR OF BUSINESS

DEVELOPMENT, INTERMAP TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Mr. LITTLE. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. We appreciate
the  opportunity  to  participate  with  you  and  your  committee.  I
thought  I  would  do  a  few  visuals.  I’d  like  to  talk  a  little  bit  about
what  the  applications  really  are  from  a  real-world  standpoint.
What  we  have  over  here  on  the  poster  board,  everyone  has  been
referencing  the  Hayman  fire.  With  this  particular,  the  red  is  the
color of infrared. False color can spot image.

And  I’m  sorry,  we’ve  got  this  thing  going  in  the  background.  I
wish  we  had  more  screens.  Actually,  the  poster  is  what  I’m  ref-
erencing.  It’s  actually  an  image  of  the  Hayman  fire.  It’s  a  170,000
acre  area.  The  technology  that’s  the  base  layer  does  the  slope  as-
pect  of  the  actual  digital  elevation  while  the  wildfire  is  actually
burning.  That  particular  technology  can  actually  see  through  the
smoke cover.

We had to do the spot collection after the fact a few weeks after
the rain had put the fire out. And we discriminate on the red there.
The  area  that’s  red  is  the  healthy  vegetation.  The  other  part,  of
course, is the burned area on the right side. And at the bottom, we
were  able  to  do  a  sloping  aspect.  And  with  that  we  were  able  to
figure  the  mud  slide,  those  sorts  of  things,  vegetation  burned,  et
cetera.

As  mentioned,  I  am  Kevin  Little  with  Intermap  based  here  in

Mr.  LITTLE.  Perfect.  Scott,  if  you  want  to  kill  that  one.  Another
one I want to know is on this poster over here, the NEXTMap Brit-
ain  poster,  if  you  could.  From  an  application  standpoint,  collecting
commercially throughout the whole country.

This  is  all  in  Scotland.  It’s  cloud  free.  That’s  an  initiative  right
now  collecting  all  over  the  U.S.,  which  we’re  at  about  65  percent
of that whole collection right now with this same level of accuracy.

Denver. Do you want to fire up that other one, please?

Yeah, let’s do this one. This is actually Yosemite, high-resolution
elevation. I think this is actually DigitalGlobe imagery draped over
the  top.  And  what  this  is,  we  actually  have  a  positional  accuracy
of  X,  Y  and  Z  with  this  image,  that  actually  you  can  use  this  in
a  handheld  device.  It’s  all  commercial.  It’s  all  very  user-friendly.
We  wanted  to  use  this  one  because  we  know  how  you  have  prob-
ably climbed that in the past several times.

Chairman  UDALL.  I  have.  Don’t  hold  it  against  me.  I  did  kill  a

lot of brain cells on the mountains.

What  we’re  showing  is,  we’re  utilizing  very  substantial  benefit.
It’s not just one specific technology. And if there’s one thing I could
leave you folks with today is the idea that applications that are fit
for  purpose.  It’s  not  technology  specific.  It’s  more  application  spe-
cific.  There  are  actually  areas  where  you  need  to  have  high-defini-
tion  satellite  imagery.  For  instance,  in  doing  city  centers,  doing
ports,  doing  choke  points  on  borders,  those  sorts  of  things.  Having
that revisit with a high-resolution commercial satellite system is a
wonderful thing.

Some  of  you  heard  people  talk  about  the  LIDAR  application
today.  LIDAR  is  a  very  wonderful  technology  more  designed  for
smaller  areas.  So  we’re  looking  for,  perhaps,  coastal  areas,  some-
times  city  centers  and  other  flood  areas.  The  radar  technology
that’s  been  used  in  the  past,  which  is  what  Intermap  utilizes,  is
good  for  broad  area  collection  of  high-resolution  digital  elevation
models, if you will.

If  we  could  look  at  Merrill  Pass,  Alaska.  This  is  actually  a  pro-
gram that was done in conjunction with Space Imaging back in the
important  part  of  GeoEye.  So  the  high-resolution  imagery  is  the
Space  Imaging  stuff.  The  terrain  is  the  Intermap.  This  is  in  con-
junction with FAA and with NASA. This Merrill Pass, Alaska area,
people take off out of this airport, fly into this area. They get stuck
in the fog and they run into the mountains.

So what we’re able to do here with my handheld GPS, in a posi-
tion where we are in relationship to the terrain. So once again, this
is  a  combined  product,  if  you  will,  with  some  real-world  applica-
tions.  We  know  within  a  meter,  plus  or  minus  on  the  X  and  Y,
about one meter on the Z of the altitude where we’re at in conjunc-
tion  with  this  line.  And  the  line  that  was  drawn,  this  particular
day,  was  going  to  be  the  wind’s  best  approach  through  this  valley.

Chairman UDALL. Where is that valley, just out of curiosity?
Mr. LITTLE. Merrill Pass is just due west of Anchorage. You take
off  from  Anchorage  International.  They  actually  fly  through  this
pass to get on the other side of the range. And some of these moun-
tain tops are 14 to 20,000 feet tall. You have a little trouble getting
through  this  area.  It’s  not  so  bad  in  Florida.  We  could  do  a  flight
with this in Florida with no problem.

Next  one  I  want  to  show  here,  Kevin  if  you  don’t  mind  showing,
this  is  actually  the  coast  area,  the  border  area  on  the  left,  shuttle
radar  coastal  imagery.  California  is  on  the  north.  The  red  line  is
the  Mexican  border.  And  Mexico,  of  course,  is  on  the  south.  And
what  we  have  is  on  the  right  side  is  a  one  contiguous  data  set  of
the—it’s 1.25 meter pixel of one meter on the Z, showing the appli-
cations  for—this  is  to  indicate  the  northbound.  It’s  the  Mexican
border. We can do the Canadian border also.

I’m sorry, my red light came on.
Chairman  UDALL.  Why  don’t  we  leave  it  there,  and  we’ll  come
back  in  plenty  of  time  for  other  questions  and  you’ll  all  have  a
chance to make more comments.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Little follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF KEVIN LITTLE

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Space  and  Aeronautics,
Intermap appreciates the opportunity to testify before you today on: Remote Sensing
Data: Application and Benefits.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 041573 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA08\040708\41573 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

Our  CEO,  Brian  Bullock,  extends  his  regrets  in  that  he  cannot  attend  this  ses-

sion, but wishes to convey his appreciation for the invitation to testify.

I  am  Kevin  Little,  Director  of  Strategic  Business  Development  and  Government
Relations  for  Intermap  Federal  Services  Inc.,  a  Colorado  company,  and  Director  of
Business  Development  for  Intermap  Technologies,  Inc.,  both  of  which  are
headquartered in Englewood, Colorado.

Intermap  is  a  remote  sensing  firm  that  creates  and  sells  digital  elevation  models
(DEMs)  and  value-added  mapping  products  derived  from  our  proprietary  airborne
Interferometric  Synthetic  Aperture  Radar  (IFSAR).  Intermap  operates  its  IFSAR
systems throughout the world for various domestic and international customers, in-
cluding the U.S. Government’s defense and intelligence interests.

Intermap  Technologies  Inc.  is  a  commercial,  publicly  traded  remote  sensing  com-
pany with its global headquarters in Englewood, Colorado, with international offices
in Europe, Asia, and Canada.

Intermap  currently  employs  approximately  145  people  in  our  Denver  office  and
continues  to  increase  the  number  of  this  high-tech  workforce.  Our  total  number  of
global employees exceeds 650 and also continues to grow.

Intermap  Technologies  was  one  of  the  first  remote  sensing  companies  to  realize
the  value  of  collecting  and  archiving  geospatial  data  for  large  geographies,  and  the
first and only to collect country-wide elevation data on a global scale.
1) Please describe the ways that remote sensing data can assist public and
private sector users in Colorado and provide benefits to State and local
governments.
In the broadest sense, remote sensing is the acquisition of information of an object
or phenomenon, by the use of either recording or real-time sensing devices that are
not in physical or intimate contact with the object (such as aircraft, spacecraft, sat-
ellite, ship, buoy, or in-situ).

Intermap’s  technology  is  airborne  specific  and  we  work  in  a  very  complementary
and  synergistic  manner  with  the  commercial  satellite  companies.  Satellite  systems
are easily deployed in areas where access is denied to commercial aircraft; however,
technical  capabilities  allow  IFSAR  to  be  used  in  areas  of  extreme  cloud  cover  and
are able to accomplish their collection mission even at night.

Though the technology behind the manner in which satellites and airborne remote
sensing  companies  gather  their  data  are  very  dissimilar  the  ‘‘fused’’  product  gen-
erated  by  orthorectifying  satellite  imagery  with  IFSAR  DEMs  produces  a  product
unparalleled in its usefulness to the end-user, both civilian and defense related.

Remote  sensing  and  the  technology  that  is  fit  for  purpose  allows  for  the  most
rapid  and  accurate  terrain  mapping 
(See  poster:
NEXTMap®  Britain)  Utilization  of  these  combined  technologies  provide  substantial
benefit for a wide range of real-world applications that may utilize the data for not
only  x  and  y  position  coordinates,  but  for  the  z—or  elevation—coordinates  as  well.
Specific  to  the  question  of  ways  that  remote  sensing  data  can  assist  public  and
private  sector  users  in  Colorado  and  provide  benefits  to  State  and  local  govern-
ments, we offer the following real-world application:

for  country-sized  areas. 

The Hayman Fire Area: (See Poster)

The  Hayman  Fire  in  June,  2002,  was  the  largest  in  Colorado’s  recorded  history,
destroying  over  600  structures  and  burning  137,000  acres.  Soon  after  containment
of  the  fire,  Intermap  Technologies,  in  collaboration  with  Space  Imaging  (now
GeoEye)  and  USGS,  acquired  IFSAR  elevation  data  and  radar  intensity  imagery  of
22  7.5’  quadrangles  encompassing  the  Hayman  Fire  burn  and  surrounding  areas
while the fire was still active.

Intermap  collected  and  provided  reflective  surface  and  bald-earth  IFSAR  DEM
and  Digital  Orthophoto  Quadrangle  (DOQ)  radar  magnitude  image  data  using  sin-
gle-pass X-band IFSAR for the Morrison and Cheesman Lake Quadrangles.

The  USGS  Rocky  Mountain  Mapping  Center  made  the  Intermap  IFSAR  data
available  to  federal,  State,  and  local  agencies  for  use  in  post-fire  recovery,  remedi-
ation planning, and training.

Subsequent to the delivery of elevation and imagery data by Intermap, the USGS
Rocky  Mountain  Mapping  Center  held  workshops  for  stakeholders  and  users  to  il-
lustrate the applications of the data sets.

Individuals representing 14 federal, State, and local agencies with interests in the

Front Range and the Hayman Fire area attended these workshops.

The Hayman Fire Area: Flood Plain Mapping

USGS  Rocky  Mountain  Geographic  Science  Center,  used  the  IFSAR  data  set  to
update  the  South  Platte  100-Year  Flood  Plain  Maps.  ‘‘The  Hayman  Post  Hazard
Mitigation Maps’’ were produced for FEMA for flood risk assessment purposes. The
revised  100-Year  Flood  Plain  of  the  South  Platte  takes  into  account  the  Hayman
Wildfire  incident,  and  assumes  worst-case  scenarios  (lakes  at  full  capacity  level).
These  maps  were  also  distributed  to  the  Colorado  Water  Board  and  local  county
managers.

Alaska Aviation Safety Project (see Merrill Pass, AK fly-through video)

Another  effort  that  combined  commercial  and  government  expertise  to  satisfy  a
real-world  issue  was  the  Alaska  Aviation  Safety  Project  (AASP),  which  moved  from
developmental  stage  to  public  participation.  The  Alaska  Department  of  Military  &
Veterans Affairs (DMVA), NASA, the FAA, Anchorage-based E–Terra LLC, and Col-
orado-based Space Imaging and Intermap Technologies joined forces to provide Alas-
ka aviators with the latest technology in flight simulation using Alaska’s unique and
challenging terrain. The program was designed to help lower the number of aircraft
accidents in Alaska.

Address Specific Flood Risk Assessment: (see PowerPoint slides)

With the use of various remote sensing products including elevation data and aer-
ial imagery, as well as utilization of existing building models, vector data and a pro-
prietary  storm-surge  algorithm,  individual  buildings  in  the  Commercial  Business
District of Miami, Florida were modeled on an address-specific basis.

The  storm  surge  algorithm  mimicked  a  Katrina-like  event,  with  a  three-meter

storm surge with the duration of approximately three hours.
2) What  role  can  remote  sensing  data  play  in  homeland  security  and  na-

tional defense?

Homeland Security & National Defense—

tion available.

With the increasing awareness of Homeland Security issues, agencies that control
and  manage  border  areas,  critical  infrastructure,  coastlines,  and  transportation
‘‘choke-points’’ are in need of an accurate, consistent topographic base map and cor-
responding high-resolution images.

The  current  maps  and  imagery  available  to  agencies  concerned  about  Homeland
Security issues do not provide an appropriate level of situational awareness for pol-
icy development, planning, operational organization, and action.

Security  decisions  need  to  be  made  with  the  most  accurate  and  current  informa-

Among  other  considerations,  IFSAR  allows  for  better  terrain  mapping  that  leads
to  a  greater  knowledge  and  capabilities  for  all  areas  of  mid-continent,  coastal,  and
border areas of the United States, and has a unique value to Department of Home-
land  Security,  State,  county,  and  local  authorities.  Intermap  is  currently  partnered
on  the  Secure  Border  Initiative  (SBI),  a  comprehensive  multi-year  plan  to  secure
America’s borders. (See poster: Comparison of Digital Surface Models)

High-resolution terrain data allows for better understanding of homeland security
defense  and  planning  measures  (especially  in  rugged  terrain  areas  that  exist  in
states like Colorado and along the border areas), and provides a better visualization
of all airport and military installation terrain issues. Following a calamitous event,
whether  a  natural  disaster  or  otherwise,  commercial  remote  sensing  assets  can  be
tasked to evaluate an area and provide information concerning details of the event,
magnitude  of  the  event,  evacuation  planning,  and  plume  drift  and  provide  change
detection.  The  responsiveness  of  these  commercial  assets  was  well  proven  following
the Aceh Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina.

These remote sensing data sets are extremely synergistic and complementary.

3) What  are  the  main  impediments  to  the  effective  use  of  commercial  re-
mote sensing data for public sector application and what would you rec-
ommend be done?
The U.S. DOD has done an excellent job of tapping the commercial market to take
advantage of technology advances, free market pricing and other similar opportuni-
ties. Commercial purchases afford the government better products at more competi-
tive  pricing.  This  is  a  win-win  for  the  government  and  for  the  private  sector,  both
contractors and end-users of the data.

FEMA  has  entered  the  final  year  of  Congressionally  appropriated  funding  of  the
Flood  Map  Modernization  Program.  Upon  completion,  map  modernization  will  pro-

vide reliable digital flood hazard data and maps for 92 percent of the Nation’s popu-
lation, and easy access and sharing of that information.

In order to leverage the successes of map modernization and further enhance the
usability  and  value  of  flood  hazard  mapping,  FEMA  has  developed  the  Risk  MAP
strategy,  which  combines  flood  hazard  mapping,  risk  assessment  tools,  and  mitiga-
tion  planning  into  one  seamless  program.  The  intent  of  this  integrated  program  is
to  encourage  beneficial  partnerships  and  innovative  uses  of  flood  hazard  and  risk
assessment data in order to maximize flood loss reduction.

FEMA,  which  has  undertaken  the  extremely  daunting  task  of  remapping  the
United  States  for  these  applications,  is  extremely  short  on  resources  and  funding.
Wherever  possible,  government  agencies  should  couple  their  programs  with  other
existing  programs  that  are  currently  being  undertaken  and  have  shared  goals,  al-
lowing them to satisfy their requirements and accomplish their mission.

It  is  important  that  the  commercial  sector  be  allowed  to  drive  the  technology  in
a  manner  in  which  all  government  entities  may  take  advantage  of  these  advances.
The  entire  map  modernization  program  needs  to  embrace  many  remote  sensing
technologies  that  have  a  reasonable  currency,  meet  a  minimum  specification  or
standard and are fit for purpose for applications.

These technologies include satellite and aerial photography as appropriate for cit-
ies, ports, urban change detection, and border choke-points, LIDAR for at-risk coast-
al areas and city centers, and IFSAR for large area collection.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
I am happy to address any questions the Subcommittee or guests may have.

Chairman UDALL. Mr. O’Connell, the floor is yours.
STATEMENT OF MR. MATTHEW M. O’CONNELL, PRESIDENT

AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, GEOEYE, INC.

Mr.  O’CONNELL.  It’s  a  great  honor  to  talk  to  you  all  about  what
GeoEye  does  to  support  the  State  and  local  governments,  the  de-
fense and Intel community, the warfighters, and still provide value
to our international and commercial customers. GeoEye is the lead-
ing  provider  of  geospatial  information,  imagery  and  solutions.  We
help our strategic partners and commercial partners. We help them
to better map, measure and monitor the world.

We  have  a  constellation  of  Earth  imaging  satellites,  and  two
mapping aircraft. Our constellation includes the .8-meter resolution

IKONOS  satellite,  and  our  new  satellite,  GeoEye-1,  which  we  will
launch  from  Vandenberg  Air  Force  Base  later  this  summer.  It  will
be the world’s highest resolution and most accurate commercial im-
agery  satellite,  imaging  the  world  at  .41  meters  in  color.  And  we
will also have an international network of ground stations, a robust
imagery  archive,  and  an  advanced  geospatial  imaging  processing
capability that’s really the center of innovation.

GeoEye’s imagery products serve the growing national and inter-
national demand of highly-detailed imagery in applications such as
mapping,  national  security,  homeland  defense,  emergency  pre-
paredness,  urban  planning,  environmental  monitoring,  resource
management  and  commercial  fishery.  In  addition  to  operating  im-
aging  satellites,  GeoEye’s  a  worldwide  leader  in  advanced  image
processing  and  photogrammetry.  We  produce  a  broad  spectrum  of
imagery products from a wide variety of satellite and airborne sen-
sors, both our own and other people’s. We also create fused images,
digital elevation models and land-use classification maps, and other
image-derived  products  that  help  our  clients  to  incorporate  valu-
able  information  into  any  geospatial  applications.  We  are  a  finan-
cially  healthy  and  viable  company,  publicly  traded  on  the
NASDAQ, and our revenues are growing.

The  remote  sensing  industry  is  not  only  strong  and  growing,  we
also  play  a  critical  role  in  supporting  both  national  security  and
commercial  applications.  Many  people  on  Capitol  Hill  realize  that
imagery  from  the  commercial  sector  is  the  most  cost-effective  solu-
tion for the Nation’s mapping needs, and that the taxpayer benefits
when the U.S. Government buys imagery from the commercial sec-
tor.

Here’s  how  it  works.  We  make  about  50  percent  of  our  revenues
from international and commercial customers. Those revenues pro-
vide  a  significant  offset  every  time  the  U.S.  Government  buys  im-
agery from the commercial sector.

As a result, it’s a better deal for the taxpayer.
If  the  government  builds  its  own  imaging  system,  the  taxpayer
pays 100 cents on the dollar (possibly more when you consider the
cost  overruns  of  some  recent  programs).  You  could  even  say  that
we  are  subsidizing  the  U.S.  Government  because  we  provide  need-
ed  imagery  and  services  at  lower  costs  than  if  the  government  at-
tempted to perform the function in-house.

So  by  supporting  the  commercial  industry,  the  U.S.  Government
receives  several  benefits.  Our  technology  helps  protect  American
lives. In addition, the technology to build our satellites can’t be ex-
ported. It’s located in states like Florida and Colorado. So when the
U.S.  Government  buys  imagery  and  products  from  the  commercial
sector, it is protecting the American industrial base.

You  could  say,  in  short,  that  by  buying  imagery  from  the  com-
mercial industry, the U.S. Government protects American jobs and
protects American security at 50 cents on the dollar.

Through  this  partnership,  the  U.S.  obtains  technical  leadership,
which results in allies seeking our assistance instead of developing
their  own  capabilities.  Current  U.S.  policy  encourages  a  robust
commercial  imagery  segment,  global  leadership,  and  reliance  on
commercial  imagery  services,  while  discouraging  the  government
competition with the private sector.

The  commercial  remote  sensing  industry  fulfills  the  Department
of  Defense  and  the  Intel  community  with  mapping,  charting  and
geodesy  requirements  at  a  fraction  of  the  cost  of  national  systems.
That’s why we believe that the industry provides the best value for
the  government’s  broad  area  collection  requirements  while  still
meeting  the  needs  of  our  commercial  and  international  customers.
Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  your  leadership  and  for  your  com-
mitment  to  the  remote  sensing  industry.  Our  American  workforce,
coupled  with  leading-edge  American  technologies  is  going  to  con-
tinue  to  play  a  significant  role  in  national  security  while  creating
new  jobs  and  providing  value  to  our  international  and  commercial
customers.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MATTHEW M. O’CONNELL

Good morning Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Feeney, and Members of the Sub-
committee  on  Space  and  Aeronautics.  Thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  participate  in
today’s  hearing.  It’s  a  great  honor  for  me  to  share  with  you  how  GeoEye  supports
the  State  and  local  governments,  the  intelligence  community  and  the  warfighters,
while providing value to our commercial customers.

GeoEye is a leading provider of geospatial information, imagery and solutions for
the national security community, strategic partners, and commercial customers. We
help  them  to  better  map,  measure  and  monitor  the  world.  GeoEye  owns  and  oper-
ates  a  constellation  of  Earth  imaging  satellites  and  two  mapping  aircraft.  Our  con-
stellation includes the one-meter resolution IKONOS satellite, and our new satellite,
GeoEye-1,  which  we  will  launch  from  Vandenberg  Air  Force  Base  this  summer.  It
will  be  the  world’s  highest  resolution  and  most  accurate  commercial  imagery  sat-
ellite, imaging the Earth with a ground resolution of 0.41 meters or about 16 inches,
and  will  be  able  to  produce  those  images  in  color.  In  addition,  we  have  an  inter-
national  network  of  ground  stations,  a  robust  imagery  archive,  and  advanced
geospatial imagery processing capabilities.

GeoEye  imagery  products  serve  the  growing  national  and  international  demand
for  highly-detailed  imagery  in  applications  such  as  mapping,  national  security,
homeland defense, emergency preparedness, environmental monitoring, urban plan-
ning,  resource  management  and  commercial  fishery.  In  addition  to  operating  imag-
ing satellites, GeoEye is a world-wide leader in advanced image processing and pho-
togrammetry. We produce a broad spectrum of imagery products from a wide variety
of satellite and airborne sensors both owned by GeoEye and those of our customers.
We  also  create  fused  images,  digital  elevation  models  and  land-use  classification
maps,  and  other  image-derived  products  that  enable  our  clients  to  incorporate  im-
agery into virtually any geospatial application. We are a financially healthy and via-
ble  company,  publicly  traded  on  the  NASDAQ  and  our  revenues  continue  to  grow.
The  American  remote  sensing  industry  is  not  only  strong  and  growing,  we  also
play  a  critical  role  in  supporting  both  national  security  requirements  and  commer-
cial  applications.  Many  on  Capitol  Hill  realize  that  imagery  from  the  commercial
sector  is  the  most  cost-effective  mapping  solution  for  the  U.S.  Government  and the
taxpayer  benefits.  Here’s  how  it  works:  we  make  about  50  percent  of  our
revenues from international and commercial customers—so those revenues
provide  a  significant  offset  in  the  overall  price  the  U.S.  Government  pays
for imagery and services. Consequently, it is a better deal for the taxpayer.
If  the  government  builds  its  own  imaging  systems,  the  taxpayer  pays  100
cents on the dollar (possibly more when you consider the cost overruns of
some recent programs.) You could even say that we are subsidizing the U.S.
Government,  because  we  provide  needed  imagery  and  services  at  lower
costs  than  if  the  government  attempted  to  perform  the  function  in-house.
By  supporting  the  commercial  industry,  the  U.S.  Government  receives  several
benefits.  Our  technology  helps  protect  American  security.  In  addition,  the  tech-
nology to build our satellites cannot be exported. Therefore, when the U.S. Govern-
ment buys imagery products and services from us, it is also protecting the American
industrial base. In short, by doing business with us, the government protects
American  jobs  and  American  security  at  fifty  cents  on  the  dollar.  It  is
through this partnership that the U.S. retains technical leadership which results in
allies seeking our assistance instead of developing their own competing capabilities.

Current U.S. policy encourages a robust commercial imagery segment, global lead-
ership, and reliance on commercial imagery services, while discouraging government
competition with the private sector. The commercial remote sensing industry fulfills
the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  and  the  Intelligence  Community’s  (IC)  mapping,

We  believe  that  the  industry  provides  best  value  for  the  government’s  broad  area
collect mission, while meeting the needs of the user community.

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  your  leadership  and  commitment  to  keeping  the
American  commercial  remote  sensing  industry  strong  and  vibrant.  Our  American
workforce  coupled  with  leading-edge  American-developed  technologies  will  continue
to  play  a  significant  role  in  national  security  while  providing  value  to  our  inter-
national and commercial customers. I look forward to your questions.

Testimony Submitted for the Record

There  are  multiple  uses  for  commercial  remote  sensing  data-to  include  providing
assistance  to  public  and  private  entities.  You  may  be  interested  to  know  that  we
have  almost  a  dozen  partners  in  Colorado.  The  combined  revenues  of  these  compa-
nies exceed $20 million, and they support hundreds of employees in the commercial
remote sensing industry.

While  we  do  sell  to  the  U.S.  Government,  we  also  established  the  GeoEye
Foundation  which  gives  imagery  grants  to  geospatial  students  and  re-
searchers.  The  GeoEye  Foundation’s  mission  is  to  foster  the  growth  of  the
next generation of geospatial technology professionals. The Foundation gives
satellite  imagery  to  students  and  faculty  at  select  educational  institutions  to  ad-
vance research in geographic information systems. To date, the Foundation has pro-
vided  imagery  at  no  cost  to  support  land  use  studies  over  Mexico,  polar  ice  studies
in the Antarctic, and city planning studies over Jerusalem. The Foundation has also
made grants to almost two dozen educational institutions and other non-profit orga-
nizations  which  include  the  University  of  Denver,  Denver  Metropolitan  State  Uni-
versity,  the  Plains  Conservation  Center  in  Aurora,  Colorado,  and  the  Mountain
Studies Institute.

The  Plains  Conservation  Center  had  a  project  aimed  at  prairie  conservation;  in
particular,  it  focused  on  rattlesnakes.  The  Center  surgically  implanted  radio  trans-
mitters into several female and male rattlesnakes over two years, and outfitted with
a  radio  receiver,  directional  antenna,  and  GPS  receiver,  and  tracked  these  snakes
from spring to fall each year with the help of trained volunteers. Information about
the  micro-habitat  environment  of  each  snake’s  tracked  location,  as  well  as  natural
history data was collected. While the Center learned much about rattlesnake move-
ments,  it  did  still  needed  to  see  the  snakes’  movements  visually  using  aerial  views
of the study site. This is where we came in.

The  GeoEye  Foundation  offered  a  sharp,  up-to-date  satellite  image  of  the  study
site  to  the  Center  without  charge.  From  the  satellite  imagery,  the  Center  could
clearly  see  routes  the  snakes  traveled  in  relation  to  specific  vegetation  types,  geo-
logic  formations,  and  man-made  structures.  The  image  enabled  the  Center  to  com-
pare snake movements relative to prairie dog colonies, and by overlaying the image
with  snake  home  range  polygons,  see  the  degree  of  overlap  between  snakes  of  both
sexes.  In  addition,  the  Center  was  able  to  provide  information  to  concerned  groups
as  to  where  snakes  traveled  and  suggest  ways  that  people  might  dissuade  snakes
from  entering  their  property.  Naturalists  at  the  Plains  Conservation  Center  have
used the image when speaking to school groups and visitors about prairie conserva-
tion  and  the  role  of  rattlesnakes  in  the  natural  environment.  We  hope  to  see  this
research published in a journal soon.

You  will  be  pleased  to  know  that  the  Foundation  has  supported  other  Colorado-
based  requests  including:  the  Mountain  Studies  Institute  which  requested  of  the
San Juan Mountains in Southwest Colorado to research the impact of airborne mer-
cury  contamination  in  high  elevation  ecosystems;  the  University  of  Denver  request
for  the  Luang  Prabang  World  Heritage  Site  preservation  in  Lao,  and  the  Denver
Metropolitan State University which requested imagery to study the impact of pine
beetle infestation in and around a few Colorado ski areas.

Additionally,  GeoEye  does  business  with  Colorado  entities  through  reseller  or
partnership  agreements  with  other  companies.  For  example,  last  year,  the  City  of
Fort Collins purchased GeoEye imagery though one of our partners, Walsh Environ-
mental  Scientists  &  Engineers,  to  analyze  prairie  dog  habitats  and  the  impact  on
the local community.

Finally,  GeoEye  was  glad  to  support  to  the  Boulder  County  Sheriff’s  Office  when
it called requesting assistance in a missing person’s case last fall. We acted quickly
and turned over several images of the areas in question from our archives. The inci-
dent was resolved, the person found alive, and we were happy to assist.

How  commercial  remote  sensing  data  supports  homeland  security  and  na-
tional security?

55

GeoEye supports our warfighters, intelligence community, and first responders 24
hours a day seven days a week. Our constellation of satellites helps to create a more
robust  National  constellation,  providing  for  revisit,  assured  access,  redundancy  and
surge. Our satellites provide unclassified imagery and derived products that are eas-
ily  used  and  shared  by  warfighters  and  allied/coalition  partners.  The  GeoEye  sys-
tems architecture supports direct down-link and tasking—with access to imagery in
minutes.  GeoEye  provides  the  National  Geospatial  Intelligence  Agency  (NGA)  im-
agery through the ‘‘NEXTVIEW’’ contract. It is also through this contract that NGA
provided 50 percent funding for our satellite, GeoEye-1, which we will be launching
later this summer.

The commercial remote sensing industry provides real value to the U.S. taxpayers
because  the  government  only  pays  for  the  capacity  it  needs.  At  the  same  time,  the
government benefits from access, revisit, and redundancy of the entire constellation.
Our  private  financing  enables  more  satellites  and  capabilities  for  the  same  tax  dol-
lars  because  the  commercial  segment  absorbs  percentage  of  the  costs.  GeoEye  pro-
vides  the  government  with  a  low  financial  risk  because  we  bear  the  risk  and  the
government  only  pays  for  data  that  is  delivered.  In  order  to  serve  our  intelligence
community, GeoEye has a secure facility in St. Louis, Missouri that provides provide
high-quality  image  processing  services  based  on  the  world’s  most  advanced  digital
processing techniques. With more than two decades of image-processing experience,
our  remote  sensing  professionals  develop,  provide  and  deliver  both  radiometric  and
geometric  image  processing  services.  We  process  images  from  a  variety  of  data
sources  including  our  own  IKONOS  and  OrbView-2,  as  well  as  and  high-altitude
and  low-altitude  aerial  imaging  systems,  Quickbird,  Landsat,  SPOT  and  IRS  sat-

and land-use and land-cover classification.

imagery.  Our  processing 

During  Hurricane  Katrina,  we  ceased  taking  imagery  for  our  commercial  cus-
tomers  to  focus  solely  on  the  devastation  in  New  Orleans  and  the  Gulf  area.  We
were  moving  so  much  imagery  that  our  usual  connection  to  NGA  was  stretched  to
capacity.  The  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  asked  us  to  set  up  a  sepa-
rate  down-link  just  for  them,  which  we  did  immediately.  Through  this  communica-
tions  pipe,  we  sent  DHS  our  entire  collection  of  imagery  of  these  areas.  This  im-
agery  was  shared  with  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA),  the  mili-
tary and National Guard, State and local officials. Because our imagery is unclassi-
fied, it was shared immediately as soon as it downloaded from the satellite.
What  are  the  main  impediments  to  more  effective  use  of  commercial  re-
mote sensing data for public sector applications? Our recommendations?

Commercial  remote  sensing  data  is  making  serious  gains  beyond  the  traditional
national security requirements and other users. With the global Internet-use explo-
sion,  interest  in  Yahoo  Maps,  Google  Earth,  and  Microsoft  Virtual  Earth  has  also
skyrocketed.  No  longer  must  one  be  an  imagery  analyst  to  appreciate  the  multiple
uses  of  commercial  imager.  One  could  say  that  the  Internet  has  turned  million  of
consumers  into  novice  imagery  analysts.  I  would  also  like  to  remind  the  Sub-
committee  that  the  imagery  we  sell  to  the  on-line  search  engines  are  from  our  ar-
chives, and not new imagery.

Ours is a unique industry. Only we can claim that our satellites have a short time
to  market  (typically  only  three  years),  when  coupled  with  low  risk  acquisition  ap-
proach  that  locks  down  design  requirements  and  does  not  permit  engineering
change  proposals  (such  as  non-reoccurring  engineering  costs)—these  factors  con-
tribute to holding costs down while providing value to the government and
the taxpayers.

We  believe  that  it  is  imperative  that  the  U.S.  Government  allows  the  American
commercial remote sensing industry to continue to be the best in the world. Foreign
competition  is  nipping  at  our  heels.  It  is  critical  that  the  government  removes  the
handcuffs so we can continue to lead, not follow, the commercial remote sensing in-
dustry. A review of the current resolution policy of .51 meters would be an excellent
starting point.

As you may know, GeoEye-1 will collect at .41 meters, but because of U.S. policy,
we  must  decrease  the  resolution  and  sell  it  to  our  international  and  commercial
partners  at  .50  meters.  Meanwhile,  other  countries  are  moving  quickly  ahead  to
build  next-generation  capability  that  will  eventually  best  this  figure.  In  order  for
our industry to continue what we do best—provide fast, unclassified down-links, we
need  to  continue  to  be  on  the  cutting  edge  of  technology,  and  not  on  the  sidelines.

Our  industry  is  unique  in  that  we  sell  almost  50  percent  of  our  data  in  the  com-
mercial  marketplace,  and  it  is  this  sector  that  is  growing  and  steadily  demanding
concessions  that  the  national  security  community  may  not  like.  However,  the  main
objective behind the President’s policy has always been to strike a balance between
commercial considerations and national security requirements.

The  U.S.  Government  does  not  need  to  ‘‘help’’  us  per  se,  but  it  should  not  hold
us back when foreign governments are actively helping its’ own home-grown compa-
nies to launch smaller, better resolution satellites. Essentially, the competitive land-
scape has changed enough that the U.S. Government is not protecting anything new
by  holding  us  back  because  foreign  competitors  are  actively  engaged  in  besting  our
technologies.  Mr.  Chairman,  America’s  greatness  should  not  be  constrained  by  our
own government.

CONCLUSION:

Mr.  Chairman  and  Ranking  Member  Feeney,  thank  you  for  your  leadership  and
commitment on this very important issue. As you know, the future is already here.
The demand for commercial imagery will only increase with growing government re-
quirements  and  by  commercial  demands—to  include  environmental  organizations,
oil  and  gas,  utility  companies,  and  non-profit  institutions.  Given  the  growing  con-
sumer  appetite  for  commercial  imagery,  we  believe  we  are  in  a  unique  position  to
support  both  national  requirements  and  to  satisfy  international  and  commercial
needs. In essence, if we are given the opportunity to participate—our indus-
try  will  not  only  fulfill  many  of  the  U.S.  Government’s  requirements,  but
also  sustain  the  industrial  base  by  providing  American  jobs.  This  includes
the  industrial  base  of  satellite  manufacturers  and  ground  infrastructure,
the  second  tier  subcontractors  to  the  primes,  and  the  geospatial  intel-
ligence community. Our imagery enables multiple applications and they, in
turn,  spawn  new  businesses.  These  are  high-tech,  highly-skilled,  and  good
paying jobs. The Department of Labor recently highlighted geospatial tech-
nologies  as  one  of  the  top  three  fastest  growing  and  most  important  high
growth industries in the 21st Century (the others were nanotechnology and
biotechnology.) This is clearly a win-win situation for America and for the
American taxpayers.

BIOGRAPHY FOR MATTHEW M. O’CONNELL

Mr.  O’Connell  is  GeoEye’s  President  and  CEO.  GeoEye,  headquartered  in  Dulles,
Virginia,  is  a  leading  provider  of  satellite  and  aerial  imagery  and  geospatial  infor-
mation.  The  company,  with  400  employees,  operates  two  Earth-imaging  satellites,
IKONOS  and  OrbView-2,  two  mapping  aircraft,  possesses  an  international  network
of  regional  satellite  receiving  ground  stations  and  has  advanced  geospatial  imagery
processing capabilities. Key customers include the Department of Defense and intel-
ligence community, strategic business partners, U.S. and international resellers and
commercial  customers.  GeoEye  is  traded  on  the  Nasdaq  exchange  (GEOY)  and  is
listed  on  the  Russell  3000  index.  GeoEye  is  launching  its  next  generation  satellite,
GeoEye-1, later this year. GeoEye-1 will be the world’s highest resolution and most
accurate  commercial  Earth-imaging  satellite,  with  a  ground  resolution  of  0.41  me-
ters or about 16 inches.

Mr.  O’Connell  has  over  twenty  years  of  experience  in  communications  manage-
ment  and  finance.  He  came  to  the  commercial  remote  sensing  industry  in  2001  as
CEO  of  GeoEye’s  predecessor,  ORBIMAGE.  In  January  2006,  Orbimage  merged
with Space Imaging to form GeoEye, Inc. In January 2008, O’Connell was appointed
by the Department of the Interior to serve on its National Geospatial Advisory Com-
mittee. In February 2008, O’Connell was elected to the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence
Foundation’s  (USGIF)  Board  of  Directors  and  in  October  2007  was  presented  with
their  Industry  Leader  award.  Also  in  October  2007,  Deloitte  named  GeoEye  as  one
of  the  Fast  50  companies  in  the  Washington  D.C.  area,  ranking  the  company  num-
ber  twelve.  In  June  2007,  Mr.  O’Connell  was  named  ‘‘Entrepreneur  of  the  Year’’  by
Ernst  and  Young  for  Communications  in  the  Washington  D.C.  region.  The  Wash-
ington  Post  ranked  GeoEye  number  one  of  all  companies  in  the  D.C.  area  for  2006
revenue  growth.  Additionally,  Space  News  named  O’Connell  one  of  the  ‘‘10  Who
Made  a  Difference  in  Space  in  2006’’  and  Via  Satellite  Magazine  named  O’Connell
as ‘‘One to Watch in 2008.’’

Prior  to  joining  GeoEye,  Mr.  O’Connell  was  a  Managing  Director  at  Crest  Advi-
sors, a New York-based private merchant bank that invested in and advised commu-
nications  companies,  and  Senior  Vice  President  of  Legal  and  Business  Affairs  for
Sony  Worldwide  Networks,  a  division  of  Sony  Corporation  specializing  in  radio  and
Internet  programming.  Before  working  at  Sony,  he  served  as  Senior  Vice  President
and general counsel of Osborn Communications Corporation, a publicly traded radio
and  television  station  operator.  Prior  to  his  tenure  at  Osborn,  Mr.  O’Connell  was
the assistant general counsel at Cablevision Systems Corporation, where he was re-
sponsible  for  acquisitions  and  finance,  including  the  company’s  initial  public  offer-
ing. Mr. O’Connell began his career on Wall Street as a lawyer specializing in merg-
ers  and  acquisitions  and  corporate  finance.  Mr.  O’Connell  holds  a  Bachelor  of  Arts
degree  in  Classics  from  Trinity  College,  where  he  was  elected  to  Phi  Beta  Kappa,
and a Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia Law School.

STATEMENT OF MS. JILL SMITH, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER, DIGITALGLOBE, INC.

Ms.  SMITH.  Thank  you.  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Sub-
committee,  thank  you  for  giving  me  opportunity  to  appear  before
you today on behalf of DigitalGlobe to discuss the applications and
benefits of remote sensing data.

DigitalGlobe  was  founded  on  the  principal  that  remote  sensing
data, specifically that acquired through satellite and aerial imaging
capabilities,  can  change  the  way  organizations  conduct  business
and  how  governments  protect  their  constituencies.  Today  more
than  ever,  we  at  DigitalGlobe  are  seeing  some  of  the  unique  ways
businesses are improving their efficiency and streamlining business
processes.  We  are  also  seeing  increasing  use  by  governments  on
emergency  response  planning,  urban  development,  and  environ-
mental monitoring.

DigitalGlobe’s customers range from defense and intelligence en-
tities to civil agencies supporting land development and emergency

response  to  companies  providing  consumer  applications,  including
personal navigation services, and Internet portal tools.

There are several advantages as a company being headquartered
here in Colorado, from the synergies that are created by having the
second  largest  aerospace  industry  in  the  Nation,  to  enjoying  the
benefit of having a robust GIS and remote sensing industry located
here,  and  also  the  ability  to  partner  with  several  of  the  country’s
leading,  excuse  me,  academic  institutions  to  develop  relevant  tech-
nical  talent  and  also  a  fabulous  lifestyle  that  allows  us  to  attract
the best people.

State  and  local  government  agencies,  including  those  in  Colo-
rado,  use  remote  sensing  data  to  meet  the  requirements  of  many
essential public service projects. Towns, cities and counties rely on
remote  sensing  data  to  understand  the  makeup  of  their  areas  for
tax  assessments,  public  works  and  public  safety  applications.  In
Colorado, in particular, as we’ve heard today, it’s particularly valu-
able  for  agricultural  monitoring,  wildfire  risk  assessment,  and  wa-
tershed mapping.

At  the  same  time,  users  at  the  national  level  utilize  remotely
sensed data for a variety of purposes. Specifically, certain U.S. Gov-
ernment  defense  and  intelligence  agencies  supply  their  users  with
unclassified,  commercial  data  for  homeland  security,  national  de-
fense and intelligence programs. Availability of commercial satellite
imagery  has  provided  the  government  with  flexibility  in  how  it
gathers  intelligence,  conducts  surveillance,  and  manages  ground,
air  and  naval  forces.  Because  commercial  imagery  is  unclassified,
it can be shared across organizations and agencies, across domestic
users  and  with  allies,  coalition  forces  and  humanitarian  aid  work-
ers to facilitate coordination.

Remote  sensing  data  can  help  to  speed  decision-making  for  mili-
tary planning and in-theater activities and for emergency response
activities.  The  remote  sensing  data  provided  by  satellite  imagery
provides the capability to conduct detailed reconnaissance and sub-
sequent extraction of critical information on targets.

In addition to military uses, remote sensing data can be very val-
uable  to  civilian  homeland  defense  efforts,  including  mapping  po-
tential  fire,  flood,  hurricane  or  earthquake  paths;  monitoring  the
expansive  U.S.  borders  both  land  and  sea;  and  identifying  possible
breaches of secure and protected high-risk facilities such as nuclear
plants and seaports.

One of the key enablers of the broader use of commercial remote
sensing  data  has  been  the  continued  support  of  the  U.S.  Govern-
ment.  In  1992  Land  Remote  Sensing  Policy  Act  set  a  baseline  for
the  licensing  and  operation  of  commercial  remote  sensing  space
systems and is still in effect today. And more recently, in the Com-
mercial Remote Sensing Policy of 2003 and the 2006 U.S. National
Space Policy have the stated objective of creating a ‘‘dynamic, glob-
ally  competitive  domestic  commercial  space  sector  in  order  to  pro-
mote  innovation,  strengthen  U.S.  leadership,  and  protect  national,
homeland and economic security.’’

We  believe  the  policies  encourage  the  U.S.  Government  to:  (A)
rely  to  the  ‘‘maximum  practical  extent’’  on  U.S.  commercial  capa-
bilities,  (b)  ‘‘refrain  from  conducting  activities  that  preclude,  deter,
or  compete  with  U.S.  commercial  space  activities,’’  (c)  ‘‘develop  a

long-term,  sustainable  relationship’’  between  the  U.S.  Government
and  U.S.  industry,  and  (d)  provide  a  ‘‘timely  and  responsive  regu-
latory  environment’’  for  licensing  the  operation  and  export  of  re-
mote sensing systems.

Congress  has  been  a  consistent  and  vocal  supporter  of  U.S.  de-
fense  and  intelligence  use  of  commercial  remote  sensing  data
through  the  ClearView  and  NextView  programs.  These  programs
have helped the U.S. Government provide an increasing amount of
commercial imagery to the warfighter, intelligence analysts and re-
lief workers every day. The industry looks forward to continuing to
work with Congress to ensure continuity of programs such as these
well into the future.

While  we  believe  there  is  widespread  Congressional  and  Execu-
tive  branch  support  for  the  growth  of  the  commercial  remote  sens-
ing  industry,  many  obstacles  nevertheless  exist.  U.S.  Government
advocates  must  remain  vigilant  that  the  enabling  tenants  laid  out
in  the  1992  Act,  and  the  2003  and  2006  policies  continue  to  have
support.  We  believe  the  benefits  of  commercially  available  remote
sensing  data  are  significant  and  that  the  industry  is  only  just  be-
ginning to develop applications.

So on behalf of DigitalGlobe, I would like to thank the Congress,
especially this subcommittee and Congressman Udall, Senior Rank-
ing Member Feeney, for your support from the earliest days of the
industry  into  the  future.  That  concludes  my  testimony.  I  would  be
happy to answer questions. Thank you.

to facilitate coordination. Remote sensing data can help to speed decision-making for
military  planning  and  in-theater  activities  and  for  emergency  response  activities.
The  remote  sensing  data  provided  by  satellite  imagery  provides  the  capability  to
conduct detailed reconnaissance and subsequent extraction of critical information on
targets.

In addition to the military uses, remote sensing data can be very valuable to civil-
ian  homeland  defense  efforts,  including  mapping  potential  fire,  flood,  hurricane  or
earthquake  paths;  monitoring  the  expansive  U.S.  borders  both  land  and  sea;  and
identifying possible breaches of secure and protected high-risk facilities such as nu-
clear plants and seaports.

One of the key enablers of the broader use of commercial remote sensing data has
been the continued support of the U.S. Government. The 1992 Land Remote Sensing
Policy Act set a baseline for the licensing and operation of commercial remote sens-
ing  space  systems  and  is  still  in  effect  today.  And  more  recently,  the  Commercial
Remote  Sensing  Policy  of  2003  and  the  2006  U.S.  National  Space  Policy  have  the
stated  objective  of  creating  a  ‘‘dynamic,  globally  competitive  domestic  commercial
space sector in order to promote innovation, strengthen U.S. leadership, and protect
national,  homeland  and  economic  security.’’ 1 We  believe  the  policies  encourage  the
U.S. Government to: (a) rely to the ‘‘maximum practical extent’’ 2 on U.S. commercial
capabilities,  (b)  ‘‘refrain  from  conducting  activities  that  preclude,  deter,  or  compete
with  U.S.  commercial  space  activities,’’ 3 (c)  ‘‘develop  a  long-term,  sustainable  rela-
tionship’’ 4 between the U.S. Government and U.S. industry, and (d) provide a ‘‘time-
ly  and  responsive  regulatory  environment’’ 5 for  licensing  the  operation  and  export
of remote sensing systems.

Congress  has  been  a  consistent  and  vocal  supporter  of  U.S.  defense  and  intel-
ligence use of commercial remote sensing data through the ClearView and NextView
programs. These programs have helped the U.S. Government provide an increasing
amount  of  commercial  imagery  to  the  warfighter,  intelligence  analyst  and  relief
worker  every  day.  The  industry  looks  forward  to  continuing  to  work  with  Congress
to ensure continuity of programs such as these well into the future.

While we believe there is widespread Congressional and Executive branch support
for the growth of the commercial remote sensing industry, many obstacles neverthe-
less exist. U.S. Government advocates must remain vigilant that the enabling tenets
laid  out  in  the  1992  Act,  and  the  2003  and  2006  policies  continue  to  have  support.
In particular, it is important that the U.S. Government continue to maximize its use
of commercial imagery, ensure a regulatory environment that promotes the commer-
cial imagery business, and enable U.S. industry to continue to be competitive in the
global imagery market.

We believe the benefits of commercially available remote sensing data are signifi-

cant and that the industry is only beginning to develop potential applications.

On behalf of DigitalGlobe, I would like to thank the Congress, especially this sub-
committee  and  Congressman  Udall,  for  your  support  from  the  earliest  days  of  the
industry  into  the  future.  That  concludes  my  testimony.  I  will  be  happy  to  answer
any questions you may have.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Ms.  Smith,  and  thank  you  to  a
very important group of witnesses. I’m going to move right to ques-
tions, and recognize myself for five minutes, and I would like to ask
each  of  you  in  turn.  I’ll  start  with  Mr.  Little,  and  I’ll  remember
later on I’ll start with Ms. Smith on the next question, in the spirit
of Mr. Byers who was on the previous panel.

The  benefits  of  commercial  over  federal  data,  this  is  an  impor-
tant  discussion.  What  opportunities  do  commercial  remote  sensing
data  enable  over  remote  sensing  data  available  from  federal  and
other public sources? And as a follow-on, could you please describe
the applications that the commercial remote sensing data can sup-
port?

Mr.  LITTLE.  Absolutely.  Thank  you  for  the  question.  It’s  quite
valid.  As  one  of  my  colleagues  indicated  earlier,  the  advantage  of
having commercial remote sensing data to the community, with co-
alition  partners,  et  cetera,  it’s  unclassified,  typically  accessible  via
the  Internet,  lots  of  commercial  applications  to  support  that.  We
ask that commercial be looked at a little more strongly.

The  NGA  and  DOD  has  done  an  excellent  job  of  looking  at  the
outside community, if you will, at the commercial side, to do the—
take care of some of these technologies.

Chairman UDALL. Mr. O’Connell.
Mr.  O’CONNELL.  As  Kevin—it  is  a  great  question,  sir,  as  Kevin
said. The fact that we’re unclassified is a terrific advantage, as we
learned with Hurricane Katrina. The government can’t disseminate
it’s classified images quickly. In Katrina, I know that both Jill and
I devoted a lot of our taskings to New Orleans. And as soon as the
imagery  was  available,  it  became  publically  disseminated.  In  fact
we  had  a  lot  of  discussion  with  the  NGA  at  the  time.  They  did  a
very  good  job  of  saying,  how  do  we  get  this  public?  Dump  it  on  all
of  the  different  providers,  not  just  Google,  not  just  Microsoft,  so  a
relief worker could immediately find out what was going on.

Similarly,  we  refer  to  them  in  articles  such  as  Space  News,  that
overseas  our  warfighters  find  unclassified  imagery  terrific  because
they can turn to an English person, and you see a tank. They can’t
do that as easily with classified imagery. So the fact that we’re un-
classified really helps.

Another  thing  that  helps  terrifically  is  our  private  financing
helps  relieve  the  government  of  financing  expensive  satellites.  Jill
and I both benefited to the tune of about $500 million. I would say
the  government  benefited  even  more.  We  go  out  and  borrow  pri-
vately,  and  provide  much  of,  if  not  most  of  the  operating  and  in-
vestment  capital.  So  I  think  that  we  provide  great  services,  great
price.  The  fact  that  it’s  unclassified  means  that  it  gets  out  faster
to the people who need it.

Ms.  SMITH.  Thank  you.  Reinforcing  what’s  already  been  said  in
terms  of  unclassified.  Second  of  all,  as  Mr.  O’Connell  highlighted,
the  proven  economics  of  the  commercial  remote  sensing  providers,
in  terms  of  their  ability  to  manage  large  contracts  and  deliver  on
time and on budget.

Thirdly  is,  of  course,  supporting  the  U.S.  industry  in  terms  of
space  technologies,  and  reinforcing  and  perpetuating  a  leadership
in the world that the U.S. is established, aided and abetted by the
policies that have been adopted.

And so those things in combination should ensure that the bene-
fits to the user are evident in terms of the applications we’ve heard
about.  The  economics  of  the  taxpayer  are  evident  in  terms  of  the
delivery  that  the  commercial  remote  sensing  providers  have  been
able  to  secure,  and  should  ensure  that  there  is  continued  leader-
ship  on  the  part  of  the  U.S.  globally  in  terms  of  technologies  for
the source.

Chairman  UDALL.  I  would  like  to  come  back  to  that  leadership
role you play in the next round. Congressman Feeney has five min-
utes,  and  then  we’ll  come  back  to  the  second  round  of  questions.
Mr.  FEENEY.  Well,  thank  you  to  all  of  our  witnesses.  Mr.
O’Connell,  you  talked  a  little  bit  about  foreign  competition.  Can
you  describe  the  capabilities  some  of  the  foreign  competition  has,
which countries, which private sector activity or government activ-
ity,  and  what  forms  of  relief  do  you  think  we  need  to  help  our
American companies with as we face the potential for more foreign
competition.

Mr.  O’CONNELL.  Congressman  Feeney,  thank  you  for  asking  the

question.

Mr. FEENEY. You’re welcome.
Mr.  O’CONNELL.  The  French—in  short,  I’ll  just  say  France,
Israel,  Korea,  Taiwan,  India,  Russia  all  have  domestic  programs.
None  of  them  are  truly  commercial,  so  we’re  competing  with  our
hands tied behind our back with people. France has .7 meters com-
ing  on  stream.  They’re  currently  using  the  spider  model  Kevin
showed  you  earlier.  It’s  five  meters  that  they  artificially  turn  into
2.5 meters.

India  has  one  meter.  It’s  wildly  inaccurate.  Our  satellites  are
both highly accurate. I know that ours is true within three meters.
The Indian satellite, although it has one meter imagery, can be in-
accurate  by  225  meters.  So  it’s  not  terribly  good  for  that.  The
Israelis have imagery which is pretty and .7 meters resolution. It’s
not accurate.

The  Koreans  have  imagery  that’s  one  meter,  and  although  the
accuracy  is  not  good,  they’re  working  on  improving  it.  The  Tai-
wanese have roughly one meter accuracy. Their satellite is unusual
because  it  always  follows  the  same  ground  tracks.  However,  all  of
these nations are trying to compete with us.

I  would  say,  sir,  that  we  don’t  need  relief.  I  think  that  the  part-
nership  we  have  is  a  true  partnership.  We  believe  that  we  deliver
good  imagery  to  our  warfighters,  to  FEMA.  We’re  not  looking  for
a  subsidy.  If  the  government  continues  to  buy  from  us  at  what  we
believe  are  highly  advantageous  rates,  then  the  government  will
not only get the imagery and solutions it needs, it will keep the for-
eign  competitors  at  bay.  It  will  continue  to  have  America  be  the
leaders.  And  as  I  think  all  three  of  us  have  said,  it’s  much  better
for  the  foreign  countries  to  come  here  and  buy  imagery  from  us
than  for  us  to  have  to  go  buy  our  imagery  from  foreign  countries.
Mr.  FEENEY.  Well,  you  mentioned,  for  example,  Taiwan  in  that
list. Surely Taiwan has the capabilities the Chinese do. They’re just

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 041573 PO 00000 Frm 00087 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA08\040708\41573 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

84

not  using  it  for  commercial  purposes.  Their  entire  space  program
is under the Defense Department, and it’s very opaque or secretive.
Mr. O’CONNELL. Yes, the Chinese have the formidable capability.
They’re  not  as  highly  advanced.  America  is  still  the  best  in  the
world,  Jill  and  I  both  do  a  lot  of  good  imagery.  The  foreigners  are
definitely trying to catch up.

I  would  say  that  the  French  are  highly  competitive.  The  main-
land Chinese have the most aggressive program in terms of volume
in  satellites.  Of  course,  we’re  unsure  about  exact  details,  but  they
have  a  very  different  attitude.  If  they  tried  and  failed,  they’ll  try
10 more times.

Mr.  FEENEY.  Ms.  Smith,  anything  to  add  about  the  foreign  com-

petition.

Ms.  SMITH.  No.  I  think  Mr.  O’Connell  highlighted  the  essence  of
that  competition,  except  to  say  that  as  we  think  about  the  future
of  this  industry,  in  some  ways  the  emphasis  is  getting  away  from,
as  it  were,  simply  vernacular.  We  use  the  raw  pixels,  and  to  pro-
vide  better  solutions  as  we  heard  this  morning  about  new  ways  to
disseminate data. It’s no longer just having the data; it’s what you
can  then  do  with  the  pixels  to  then  provide  value  to  applications.
And  so  the  emphasis  of  the  U.S.  industry  to  increasingly  focus
on  superior  applications,  and  around  utility,  including  dissemina-
tion, is an essential part of our defensive response and offensive re-
sponse to foreign competition.

Mr.  FEENEY.  You  heard  earlier—this  is  for  all  of  the  witnesses.
Just  briefly,  you  heard  the  earlier  panel  talk  about  problems  that
could be created for them if Landsat 5 or 7 went down and we had
a  gap.  Would  it  create  specific  problems  for  what  you  do  in  terms
of your capabilities.

Mr.  O’CONNELL.  It  would  create  problems  for  some  of  the  people
that  we  consider  clients.  But  we  have  a  satellite  called  OrbView-
2 that delivers ocean information that’s used by researchers around
the world. I know that would be a significant issue for them.

We’re actually developing a deeper relationship with those people
because we created a foundation to the scientific community to de-
velop new applications. Similar to the extent they suffer, we suffer.
You’ll  be  happy  to  hear  that  the  University  of  Florida  and  lots  of
schools  in  Colorado  are  using  that  imagery.  We  wanted  to  develop
innovative  products,  as  Ms.  Smith  said.  It’s  very  important  for
America  to  continue  to  have  the  cutting  edge.  So  in  the  terms  of
the  scientific  community,  it  doesn’t  hurt  us  directly,  but  hurts  us
indirectly.

Mr.  FEENEY.  I  may  have  a  question  or  two  on  the  second  round.

Mr. Chairman.

Chairman  UDALL.  Let’s  move  to  the  second  round,  I’ll  recognize
myself  again  for  five  minutes.  I  want  to  peer  at  this  discussion,
drill  down  a  bit  further  on  what  Congressman  Feeney  brought  up.
What’s  the  most  important  factor  enabling  your  company  to  com-
pete and agree in the global remote sensing industry? And as a fol-
low-on, what role does the government play in promoting a healthy
commercial remote sensing industry.

We  covered  a  little  bit  of  this  ground.  I  want  to  get  this  on  the
record,  and  opportunities  that  will—that  are  present  for  us.  So
we’ll start with Jill.

85

Ms.  SMITH.  I  think  there  are  two  core  areas  where  the—how
Congress plays out and how the U.S. Government manages the in-
dustry  and  materially  helps  ensure  that  we,  as  an  industry,  are
able  to  retain  leadership.  The  first  is  around  policies  and  regula-
tions.  And  I’ll  come  back  to  that  in  one  second.  And  second  is
around advocacy.

And with regard to policy and regulation, the first from our per-
spective  is  to  ensure  vigilance  around  implementation  of  the  poli-
cies  that  have  already  been  articulated,  have  already  been  put  in
place,  are  to  ensure  that  we  are  using  commercial  imagery  and
commercial  companies  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  for  invest-
ing and building out U.S. Government assistance.

The  second  wall  is  ensuring  that  the  licensing  regulations  that
are  governing  our  industry  don’t  further  impede  the  industry.  And
where  appropriate,  and  as  the  markets  change,  enable  us  to  be  as
competitive as we can be in the industry while still, of course, pro-
tecting national security.

With  regard  to  advocacy,  we  have,  today,  in  place  an  office  of
space  commercialization  which  is  currently  under  NOAA.  There  is
a  legislation  that  has  been  proposed  by  the  Department  of  Com-
merce  to  reinforce  and  strengthen  the  role  of  the  office  of  space
commercialization,  and  we  would  agree  that  this  is  a  very  impor-
tant potential step forward to ensure long-term advocacy.

Mr.  O’CONNELL.  I’d  like  to  echo  what  Ms.  Smith  said.  I  think
that  there  are  existing  policies  in  place  right  now  that  are  terrific
policies.  I  think  that  the  government  has  to  be  vigilant  to  be  sure
that  they’re  adhered  to.  The  policy  currently  states  that  the  U.S.
Government should, to the extent possible, use as well as it can for
its commercial remote sensing needs.

There  are  a  lot  of  areas  that  we  can  fulfill,  as  I  said  before.  The
collection  of  broad  area  mapping  is  something  that  we  can  do,  we
think, faster, better and cheaper than the U.S. Government, so we
would  like  the  government  to  continue  to  use  us  for  that,  and  in
fact to look at our other areas where we could do that.

Again, we believe that the taxpayer benefits every time they buy
a  pixel  from  us.  We  also  believe  that  the  current  regulations
have—that  have  recently  been  relaxed  allow  us  to  distribute  im-
agery at a resolution of .5 meter. That’s important. It came a little
late because the French actually started distributing—or, I’m sorry,
the  Israelis  were  distributing  imagery  at  a  lower  resolution  than
Americans were permitted to for a while.

So  I  think  the  government  has  to  continue  to  monitor  that.
There’s  no  reason  why  we  should  be  playing.  Right  now,  on  our
next satellite, we’ll image at .41.

We’ll  be  required  to  raise  that  imagery  up  to  .5.  That  doesn’t
bother us at the moment because nobody’s competitive, although it
doesn’t  really  make  that  much  sense.  I  think  that  it’s  important
that  the—it’s  important  that  the  U.S.  stay  the  leader  and  not  be
the follower.

Chairman UDALL. Mr. Little.
Mr.  LITTLE.  Yes,  very  quickly  I  concur  with  everything  they’ve
said.  Another  thing  that  just  came  to  mind  is  the  fact  that,  for  in-
stance,  this  is  a  daunting  task  in  satisfying  the  requirements,  et
cetera.  They  spend  a  lot  of  money  doing  a  lot  of  things.  And  my

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Nov 24, 2008 Jkt 041573 PO 00000 Frm 00089 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA08\040708\41573 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

86

opinion is that they probably shouldn’t be spending that money to,
like, remap the U.S. The risk map that FEMA is putting together,
and flood plane mapping, et cetera. They’re asking the Congress for
five  years,  and  that  can  more  readily  be  done  by  the  commercial
entities  that  are  available,  and  they  could  spend  their  efforts  and
their monies probably a little more wisely. Thank you.

Chairman  UDALL.  I  was  saying  to  Congressman  Feeney  that  he
and I are going to look further into the situation you just described
because  we  have  limited  resources.  We  have  a  lot  of  needs.  We
don’t want to sort of duplicate activities. I know we’re going to have
a third round. I’m going to end the second round and recognize Mr.
Feeney.

Mr.  FEENEY.  What,  Mr.  O’Connell,  prohibited  some  of  the  finer
capabilities  that  you  have?  Is  that  for  security  means?  I  mean,
what—you  know,  I  honestly  don’t  think  anything  in  this  environ-
ment  is  secure,  but  what  would  be  the  type  of  reasoning  that  gov-
ernment  agencies  would  prohibit  you  from  making  available  what
your capabilities allow you to?

Mr.  O’CONNELL.  That’s  a  great  question,  sir.  Your  own  question
about  privacy,  yes,  it  is  related  to  overall  security.  There  is  a  lin-
gering  sentiment  in  some  parts  of  the  government  that  there
should  be  no  private-sector  involvement,  and  there  should  be  no
commercial involvement in overhead surveillance.

As  I  think  Mr.  Byers  said,  the  cat  is  kind  of  out  of  the  bag  on
that one. Our question on privacy was a very good one, and I’d like
to kind of talk about that, because I think that that’s different than
what  we’re  talking  about  here.  Mr.  Byers  said  that  he  believed  in
transparency. I think we all think it’s good being able to see what’s
going on in Iran. You have to balance that transparency out of our
natural  desire  for  privacy.  We  think  the  government  has  done  a
good job so far. It’s tough. We’re all subject to follow all those laws
and regulations.

Having  said  that,  when  terrorists  use  dual  imagery  to  strike  a
British  camp  in  Iraq,  that  was  obviously  troublesome.  When  dis-
seminating things to places like Google, that we just adopt a simple
rule. Let’s not image active military bases in the field. That hasn’t
been acted on because it’s the beginning of a tough question. Then
you  say,  well,  how  about  military  headquarters  like  the  Pentagon?
How  about  hospitals?  How  about  schools?  People  won’t  stick  with
simple solutions. So that’s never gotten anywhere.

Also, as Mr. Navarro said, it’s tough because you have American
companies. The government can regulate us. But if the French and
Indians  and  Israelis,  and  whoever  else—the  French  will  sell  their
imagery.  I  said  it  with  the  French  sitting  next  to  me,  and  they’re
proud  of  it.  So  I  don’t  know  how  we  can  constrain  an  information
flow when America doesn’t constrain the information.

Chairman UDALL. Ms. Smith.
Ms.  SMITH.  I  have  nothing  else  for  that.  I  think  Mr.  O’Connell

covered it very, very well.

Mr.  FEENEY.  I  guess  my  last  question  would  be  with  respect  to
the data that you rely on from NOAA and NASA, how much do you
rely on the data, if at all, from NOAA and NASA, and how free are
they in terms of responding to the data requests when you have it?
For all the witnesses.

87

Ms.  SMITH.  I  think  it  was  Mr.  O’Connell  who  referred  earlier  to
fundamentally  our  job  is  to  provide  superior  solutions  for  our  cus-
tomers. And there are, indeed, certain types of applications or sim-
ply  availability  and  capacity  necessitates  that  the  customer  take
lower,  or  I  should  say,  a  lower  resolution  imagery  from  NASA  or
NOAA or otherwise.

So we as a company do sometimes put together solutions on inte-
gration  of  multiple  sources.  And  so  in  that  sense,  to  the  extent  to
which there were any difficulties getting access to that imagery, as
Mr.  O’Connell  said  earlier,  it  would  be  the  customers  that  suffer.
We have had no issues with regard to access to that imagery at all,
and likely that it is available to as many users as it is.

Mr. O’CONNELL. We actually do use NASA imagery, and some of
our  blended  products.  As  Ms.  Smith  said,  it’s  getting  more  and
more  important  not  just  to  have  pixels,  but  what  do  we  do  with
pixels. So we’ve had to work with the development of complex prod-
ucts.  Our  efficient  product  uses  our  satellite  imagery  as  a  base
map,  and  then  takes  a  different  resource.  That’s  the  terrific  part.
We sell them imagery. So I can see it has all been great.

I  would  say  on  NOAA,  on  the  regulatory  side,  NOAA  has  been
a  very  good  overseer.  They  sometimes  get,  I  think—the  pace  with
which  the  commercial  sector  operates  is  daunting,  and  NOAA  has
risen  to  the  challenge.  I  might  say,  I  know  it’s  off  the  subject,  but
as  long  as  you’re  asking,  about  what  Congress  may  be  doing,  and
that has restricted both of us.

We’re  not  trying  to  do—we’re  not  trying  to  put  a  ground  station
in  China,  but  we  had  to  send  a  replacement  part  to  Israel  for  a
ground  station  that  was  approved  10  years  ago.  It  took  us  nine
months to get approval. I’m not sure why that works that way.

Mr.  LITTLE.  Quickly,  NOAA,  NASA,  et  cetera,  NOAA  on  the
coastal  flood  areas,  NASA  on  a  number  of  items,  we’ve  worked  on
them globally, as I mentioned earlier on the Merrill Pass in Alaska
program.  That  was  an  FAA  initiative  that  was  funded  by  NASA,
and  a  very  interesting  relationship.  So  they’re  good  folks  to  work
with from our standpoint, very innovative.

NASA’s  mission  is  a  little  different  nowadays.  As  I  recall,  there
was a study done a few years ago that suggested that NASA should
probably get out of the Earth observation business and get into the
space  exploration  business  where  they  actually  belong,  and  leave
the export of Earth observations to commercial. Thank you.

Mr. FEENEY. Thanks. I don’t have any further questions. I’ll just
say that I sort of instinctively, out of habit, support the commercial
side. What I call a phone book test, if more than two people in the
private sector provide a good or service, it’s probably very unlikely
that I would be supportive for the government getting involved. So
you’ve got a sort of instinctive ally.

I want to pass to the Chairman again.
Chairman  UDALL.  Before  I  ask  this  final  question,  I  did  want  to
take just a moment to acknowledge an advantage of a product that
each  one  of  your  companies  provide.  Because  in  part  the  whole
hearing  was  to  further  educate  the  public  and  trumpet  what  you
all  are  doing.  And  I  know  Intermap  has  a  product,  like  what  we
saw on the screen that we use in places like Iraq and Afghanistan
as a phenomenal tool.

Mr.  O’Connell,  I  commend  to  everybody’s  attention,  the  second
half  of  your  testimony.  Some  of  the  best  things  you’re  doing  in
monitoring wildlife and helping us do what we need to do to main-
tain the populations that not only are important because of our in-
terest in wildlife and the thrill and the inspiration they provide for
us, but they help keep our planet healthy.

And  then  Ms.  Smith,  DigitalGlobe,  some  of  you  may  remember,
in  Boulder  County  two  years  ago  we  were  looking  for  a  missing
Marine.  On  immediate  request  on  the  weekend,  your  staff  re-
sponded,  and  to  the  family  and  to  many  of  us  trying  to  find  that
Marine. So there’s a talent of stories of what you all are doing. It’s
exciting,  cutting  edge.  The  jobs  you  all  provide  pay  healthy  sala-
ries.  It’s  just—it’s  inspirational.  I,  like  Congressman  Feeney,  sug-
gest that we default to want to support what you all are doing.

Let me have one final question. Following Dr. Montagu who was
on  the  earlier  panel,  he  urged  the  Federal  Government  and  the
local  and  regional  government  to  leverage  the  tremendous  pur-
chasing  power  of  the  Federal  Government  in  the  commercial  re-
mote sensing data marketplace.

What’s  your  response  to  this  idea,  and  are  there  other  things
that  Federal  Government  can  do?  And  maybe  we’ll  start  with  you,
Mr. Little, and move back across.

Mr. LITTLE. Very much so. We had a situation with the wildfires
in  California  where  NGA  and,  actually,  more  Northcom  purchased
IFSAR  data  along  the  coastal  areas  in  California,  and  inclusive  of
that.  That’s  part  of  the  whole  program.  We  have,  as  I  mentioned,
about 65 percent of the U.S. collected already, very high-resolution
terrain.

One of the things that happened out there was a plan to do some
C130 drops, water drops. They were trying to do some planning in
case  there  were—they  had  to  evacuate  hospitals  and  nursing
homes,  those  sorts  of  things.  They  had  to  put  Marines  on  the
ground, shoes on the ground, boots on the ground, if you will.

In  part  of  the  discussion,  they  also  said,  what  would  happen,  if
we  provide  this  data,  gave  a  license  to  NGA  at  this  time,  under
their  customers,  could  we  provide  to  the  end-users  in  California.
And  we  said  certainly,  as  what  happened  with  the  tsunami  inci-
dent  in  Aceh  a  few  years  ago  when  the  satellite  guys  made  their
stuff available. We want to encourage that as much as we can. The
usage of that is important. So our licensing techniques or methods,
we  license  to  the  Federal  Government.  And  through  that  licensing
mechanism, it can be licensed ultimately to the end-user.

I think one of the things that came up on the previous panel was
it’s  an  education  thing  as  much  as  anything,  because  the  folks  at
the  end-user  level  don’t  understand  that  it’s  available  or  how  it’s
available  or  how  it’s  licensed.  So  I  hope  that  answers  your  ques-
tion.

Mr. O’CONNELL. As Mr. Little said, we do deliver a lot of imagery
at  the  State  and  local  governments,  currently.  Our  model  with
NGA is a little different. NGA paid half the cost of the next genera-
tion  satellite  we’re  building  and  half  the  cost  of  the  satellite  that
was  just  launched.  When  you  pay  that  much  up  front,  you  get  a
good discount. That’s why the Federal Government would get a fa-

vorable  price  from  us.  We  would  be  happy  to  talk  to  them  about
it.

But  a  part  of  the  next  competition  was  that  we  had  to  con-
template  we  were  commercially  viable.  If  you  just  change  it  now,
it  changes  some  of  the  revenue  streams  we  were  looking  at.  We’re
not  objecting  to  it,  because  we  have  this  really  good  partnership
with  NGA.  But  it’s  a  night  and  day  point  where  the  Department
of  Labor  has  said  that  three  of  the  highest  growing  areas  of  jobs
are nanotechnology and biotechnology and geospatial sciences.

It’s  one  of  the  reasons  why  some—there’s  been  such  terrific

growth in our offices in Thornton.

We can only hire all those people, in competition with people like
Lockheed  Martin  and  ITT  who  is  sitting  right  here  if  we  are  mak-
ing  money.  So  the  revenue  mix  is  complicated.  We’d  be  happy  to
look at expanding the model and letting the states leverage. I think
it’s  very  important  that  they  do  use  the  imagery,  but  I  think  that
it’s a complex issue.

Ms.  SMITH.  Thank  you.  Several  opportunities  have  been  identi-
fied.  I’d  also  like  to  add  the  opportunity  for  better  coordination
around homeland security. And certainly as an industry, I think we
feel  as  if  we  are  underservicing  homeland  security  because  of  the
challenge  of  operating  both  at  a  local  and  at  a  federal  level.  And
therefore  we  believe  there  are  many  opportunities  to  support  that.
Similarly,  in  terms  of  ensuring  that  homeland  security  acts  in  a
way  that  is  consistent  with  the  commercial  remote  sensing  policy
in  terms  of  looking  for  commercial  resources,  commercial  remote
sensing resources, ahead of proprietary U.S. Government resources,
therein  lies  an  opportunity  to  ensure  that  that’s  pushed  down,  not
only  the  federal  level,  but  also  into  a  local  level  to  the  benefit  of
all. Thank you.

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you.  I  did,  as  I  bring  the  hearing  to  a
close,  want  to  acknowledge  the  presence  of  Lockheed  Martin,  Ball
Aerospace, and ITT who have been here as well. And Mr. O’Connell
and  everybody  at  the  table  here  knows  that  they’re  key  links  in
this whole chain.

I want to thank the two panels of witnesses, citizens of Colorado
Springs  that  have  joined  us,  other  interested  parties.  And  to  keep
faith with Congressman Feeney, as colleagues of mine, if there’s no
objection,  the  record  will  remain  open  for  additional  statements  of
Members and for answers to follow-up questions the Subcommittee
may want to ask other witnesses. And without objection, it’s so or-
dered.

The hearing is now adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 12:11 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

Regional Council of Governments

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. The development of data standards can help facilitate the widespread use of re-
mote  sensing  data  and  information.  Based  on  your  experience,  how  well  are
mechanisms  to  coordinate  the  development  of  data  formats  and  standards
among  Federal  Government  agencies  and  other  remote  sensing  data  users  such
as  yourselves  working?  What,  if  any,  actions  should  the  Federal  Government
take to strengthen efforts to develop data standards?

A1. My experience with the mechanisms to coordinate the development of data for-
mats and standards is limited to observing the activities of the Federal Geographic
Data Committee (FGDC). I have observed the development of various FGDC stand-
ards in three different capacities as an educator (teaching GIS at Miami University
in Ohio), a data standards ‘‘consumer,’’ and as a member of the professional associa-
tion with direct interest in some of outputs of the FGDC’s work.

Generally  speaking,  the  FGDC  coordinates  these  efforts  well,  allowing  for  appro-
priate input and deliberation before publishing the final standards. My only critique
would be that some of the resultant standards are overly complex. However, in fair-
ness to the FGDC, this is probably a reflection of the complexity of the subject mat-
ter, and the broad scope of the various standards themselves, rather than any inher-
ent flaw in the FGDC process.
Q2. How significant is the issue of training your workforce to use remote sensing in-
formation  and  incorporate  it  into  your  organization’s  services  and  operations?
What role, if any, should the Federal Government play in ensuring that opportu-
nities  exist  to  train  workers  in  the  use  of  remote  sensing  data  and  information?
A2. The  geospatial  technologies  industry  as  a  whole  remains  an  important  and
growing  sector  of  the  Colorado  economy.  This  trend  is  mirrored  across  the  Nation.
Sustaining  this  growth  will  require  a  commitment  from  all  levels  of  government  to
support  the  basic  skills  and  knowledge  training  needed  to  ensure  the  industry  has
the talent it requires.

Fundamental to this is an improved commitment to basic math and analytical lit-
eracy.  All  of  the  geospatial  sciences,  but  especially  remote  sensing,  require  a  solid
background in the fundamentals of mathematics. My experience teaching in the Ge-
ography  department  at  Miami  University  revealed  a  wide  discrepancy  in  the  level
of math preparedness of students coming into college.

For  this  country  to  remain  a  leader  in  the  geospatial  technologies  industry,  our
future  workforce  must  receive  a  basic  grounding  in  math  as  high  school  students,
rather  than  play  ‘‘catchup’’  in  college.  The  Federal  Government’s  direct  role  in  this
is  perhaps  limited.  However,  the  past  history  of  the  aeronautical  and  engineering
sciences  suggests  that  Federal  Government  leadership  and  goal  setting  does  do  a
lot to promote State and local engagement in broader, national endeavors.
Q3. You  testified  on  the  valuable  uses  of  remote  sensing  data  and  the  benefits  your
organization  has  gained  in  return.  What  are  your  suggestions  on  ways  to  dis-
seminate  or  share  these  applications  with  other  State  and  local  agencies  that
may  be  considering  the  use  of  remote  sensing  data  or  that  are  unaware  of  the
value it may offer?

A3. Fortunately  for  DRCOG,  the  community  of  Regional  Planning  Commissions/
Metropolitan Planning Organizations is relatively small and thus ‘‘knowledge trans-
fer’’  is  relatively  easy.  Indeed,  DRCOG  learned  a  great  deal  from  its  peers  as  we
put together the Denver Regional Aerial Photography Project.

Additionally, we have as one of our mandates the provision information and tools
to  our  local  government  membership  of  matters  that  are  typically  outside  the  pur-
view  of  their  normal  governmental  operations.  This  typically  includes  matters  that
transcend  their  jurisdictional  boundaries,  but  also  includes  matters  of  new  tech-
nology  of  which  they  may  not  be  aware.  We  provide  this  service  through  a  number
of  avenues,  ranging  from  one-on-one  training,  informational  products  distributed
both  in  hard  copy  and  electronic  format,  and  through  custom  workshops  and  train-
ing  courses.  We  have  used  all  of  these  formats  in  recent  years  to  provide  DRCOG’s
member governments with information about current and emerging geospatial tech-
nologies with relevancy to the business of local and regional governance.

formation  and  incorporate  it  into  your  organization’s  services  and  operations?
What role, if any, should the Federal Government play in ensuring that opportu-
nities exist to train workers in the use of data and information?

A1. The availability of training opportunities has not been an impediment. Between
vendors  and  internal  cadres  of  technical  experts,  the  agency  offers  an  array  of
geospatial  technology  training  opportunities  for  natural  resource  land  managers.
The  Federal  Government  should  continue  to  work  in  partnership  with  vendors  to
develop  and  provide  training  in  the  use  of  data  and  information  collected  through
the application of remote sensing technologies.
Q2. You  testified  on  the  valuable  uses  of  remote  sensing  data  and  the  benefits  your
organization  has  gained  in  return.  What  are  your  suggestions  on  ways  to  dis-
seminate  or  share  these  applications  with  other  State  and  local  agencies  that
may  be  considering  the  use  of  remote  sensing  data  or  are  unaware  of  the  value
it may offer?

A2. For  the  State  and  Private  Forestry  Forest  Health  Protection  (FHP)  staff,  this
issue is very relevant. FHP field staff is trained and able to provide technical assist-
ance to State and local partners for use of new technology or technical adaptations.
This  system  works  well,  though  on  technology  issues,  adoption  is  sometimes  slow
even  with  willing  State  partners.  Early  stakeholder  involvement  synergizes  the
technology  adoption  process.  Involving  State  partners  in  the  design  phase  of  a
project increases the opportunity for the project’s successful adaptation and applica-
tion. A recent example of this type of development is the Southern Pine Beetle Haz-
ard  Maps  Project,  where  State  partners  in  13  southern  states  had  an  integral  role
in project development.

Our Technology Service Centers such as the Remote Sensing Applications Center
and  the  Forest  Health  Technology  Enterprise  Team  both  have  robust  web  sites.
Reaching  our  partners  through  regular,  disciplined,  updates  of  our  web  site  is  cru-
cial  in  keeping  our  partners  aware  of  the  latest  developments.  Sharing  raw  and
processed  data  through  the  multiple  agency  spatial  data  clearing  houses  is  also  a
crucial part of the strategy.

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. The development of data standards can help facilitate the widespread use of re-
mote  sensing  data  and  information.  Are  you  satisfied  with  the  opportunities
available  to  commercial  remote  sensing  companies  to  help  coordinate  data  for-
mats and standards among Federal Government agencies, academic institutions,
and other remote sensing data producers and users? What actions, if any, do you
believe  would  strengthen  mechanisms  to  coordinate  the  development  of  data
standards?

A1. Overall,  the  Defense  and  Intelligence  communities  within  the  US  government
have  done  an  excellent  job  over  the  years  in  evolving  and  focusing  their  require-
ments in out-sourcing their technology needs to the commercial community.

Outsourcing  allows  these  agencies  to  focus  on  the  complex  and  dynamic  mission
requirements  that  drive  their  organizations  and  allow  them  to  remain  flexible  in
partnering  with  the  commercial  industry  to  assist  them  in  satisfying  these  require-
ments.

By  out-sourcing  these  requirements,  these  agencies  leverage  the  funding  they  re-
ceive to maximum benefit. Working with the private sector, the agencies can develop
a  series  of  minimum  requirements  for  data  production  but  do  not  have  to  commit
resources for in-house production of such data. The private sector will make the in-
vestment  in  ensuring  that  these  minimum  data  requirements  are  met.  Further,  all
technological  improvements  and  upgrades  in  the  production  of  such  data  are  borne
by the private sector—again preserving agencies funds to meet core mission require-
ments.

Many  federal  agencies  do  not  have  a  similar  level  of  experience  the  Defense  and
Intelligence  communities  possess  in  leveraging  that  which  the  private  sector  can
offer. There oftentimes is a tendency to utilize scarce budget amounts to build entire
systems.  System  development  requires  updates  and  modifications—all  of  which  can
be  sustained  by  the  private  sector.  The  Defense  and  Intelligence  communities  have
realized they can contract for only the data that their programs require without in-
vesting in the overall system themselves. This approach satisfies the need for accu-
rate,  updated  and  timely  data  with  a  clear  understanding  that  the  data  production
in the future will continue to improve. Typically, when the private sector continues
to  invest  in  technological  upgrades,  it  can  offer  the  data  it  produces  at  lower  costs
because  it  understands  the  government  will  be  a  market  rich  environment  for  the
data.

The  complexity  of  vision  and  mission  statement  for  many  civilian  agencies,  com-
bined with an understaffed and underfunded work force, makes it more critical than
ever  to  engage  the  commercial  sector.  The  private  sector  can  help  these  agencies
focus  on  their  goals  and  develop  the  appropriate  technologies,  solutions  and  stand-
ards to assist them in accomplishing their mission.

A1. In response to your question for the record regarding data standards, there are
currently  several  government  specific  standards  we  use.  While  these  standards  are
sufficient  for  the  process  and  dissemination  of  commercial  imagery,  we  believe  that
new standards such as XML-based metadata could exponentially increase the deliv-
ery  of  data.  However,  the  government  is  very  slow  to  adopt  new  standards  simply
because  so  many  of  its  other  systems  are  legacy-based.  We  believe  our  imagery
would be more usable to the Department of Defense community if it could be deliv-
ered  in  GeoTIFF/MrSID  formats  with  an  XML  metadata  file.  This  would  expedite
the speed in which users could access and receive the data. Nonetheless, we do not
believe  industry  would  benefit  from  any  new  standards  as  the  government  is  still
attempting to evolve its legacy systems to today’s technologies.
