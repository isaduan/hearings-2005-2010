HEARING CHARTER

SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

The Benefits and Challenges of

Producing Liquid Fuel From Coal:

The Role for Federal Research

WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 2007

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On Wednesday, September 5, 2007 the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment
of  the  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  will  hold  a  hearing  to  receive  testi-
mony  on  the  use  of  coal  to  produce  liquid  fuel,  the  status  of  coal-to-liquid  (CTL)
technologies  and  what  additional  research,  development  and  demonstration  pro-
grams should be undertaken at the Department of Energy or other agencies to bet-
ter understand the benefits and barriers to converting coal into transportation fuels.
The  Subcommittee  will  hear  testimony  from  six  witnesses  who  will  speak  to  a
range  of  policies  that  warrant  consideration  before  moving  forward  with  the  ad-
vancement of the production of synthetic transportation fuels from coal. Policies for
consideration  include  carbon  dioxide  management,  infrastructure  improvements,
water  usage,  energy  security,  energy  balance  of  CTL  technologies  (energy  used  and
produced),  exhaust  emissions,  options  for  using  coal  with  organically  derived  feed-
stocks  to  produce  liquid  fuels,  coal  production  requirements,  potential  outcomes  for
consumers,  and  the  appropriate  level  of  federal  investment  in  CTL  technologies.
They also will discuss the technical and economical challenges with meeting any de-
sired policy objectives as well as the benefits and drawbacks of investing federal re-
sources in CTL technologies.
Witnesses
Dr.  Robert  L.  Freerks,  Director  of  Product  Development  Rentech  Corp.,  Denver,
CO. He will speak to the state of development of CTL technologies using the Fisch-
er-Tropsch process. He will highlight the benefits of the commercialization of the F–
T process and discuss some of the challenges.
Mr. John Ward, VP, Marketing and Governmental Affairs Headwaters, Inc., South
Jordan,  Utah.  He  will  discuss  the  growing  global  demand  for  oil  and  the  need  to
explore alternative liquid fuel options using the Nation’s abundant coal reserves. He
will  review  the  local  and  global  economic  benefits  as  well  as  the  national  security
and environmental benefits.
Dr. James Bartis, Sr., Policy Researcher, RAND Corp., Arlington, VA. He will ad-
dress economic and national security benefits of CTL technology as well as the tech-
nical challenges for addressing the carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the CTL
process. He will also provide suggestions for federal activities needed to address the
uncertainties surrounding CTL technology.
Mr.  David  G.  Hawkins,  Director,  Climate  Center  at  Natural  Resources  Defense
Council,  Washington,  DC.  He  will  speak  to  the  environmental  concerns  associated
with  the  adoption  of  CTL  technologies—in  particular,  the  ‘‘well-to-wheel’’  emissions
of  these  new  fuels  and  the  impact  on  global  climate  change.  He  will  also  address
other energy strategies which still rely on coal, but help to reduce our nation’s car-
bon dioxide footprint at the same time.
Dr.  Richard  D.  Boardman,  The  Secure  Energy  Initiative  Head,  Idaho  National
Laboratory,  Idaho  Falls,  ID.  He  will  discuss  water  resource  management  related  to
the  production  of  liquid  fuels  from  coal.  He  will  also  address  the  potential  for  pro-
ducing liquid transportation fuels using coal with organically derived feedstocks.

Dr.  Joseph  Romm,  Center  for  Energy  &  Climate  Solutions;  Center  for  American
Progress; former Acting Asst. Secretary at Department of Energy during the Clinton
Administration, Washington, DC. He will address the environmental policy consider-
ations  related  to  advancing  CTL  technology.  He  will  focus  on  the  role  of  CTL  tech-
nology in a world with greenhouse gas constraints.

Background

The  coal-to-liquids  (CTL)  process  was  discovered  by  German  scientists  and  used
to  make  fuels  during  World  War  II.  Since  that  time,  there  has  been  varying  inten-
sity  of  interest  in  this  technology.  As  the  price  of  petroleum  and  natural  gas  stays
high,  there  will  be  an  increasing  interest  in  developing  the  commercial  potential  of
producing synthetic liquid fuels from coal.

There  are  a  number  of  proposed  CTL  projects  in  the  United  States  and  overseas,
and  SASOL  in  South  Africa  has  a  long  history  with  CTL.  According  to  the  2007
Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  (MIT)  Report  ‘‘The  Future  of  Coal,’’  SASOL
has  been  producing  195,000  barrels  per  day  of  liquid  fuel  using  Fischer-Tropsch
technology for several decades. In addition, jet fuel from a gas-to-liquids pilot plant
has already been certified for use by the United States Air Force.

There  are  two  mainstream  processes  for  producing  liquid  fuels  for  transportation
applications: direct and indirect. It is generally the indirect route for liquid fuel pro-
duction  that  is  discussed  in  the  United  States.  A  good  explanation  for  the  focus  on
the indirect process is the fact that SASOL in South Africa has commercialized that
technology increasing the confidence in the indirect approach to liquefaction. In ad-
dition,  the  MIT  Report  explains  that  converting  coal  directly  to  liquid  products  re-
quires reactions at high temperatures and high hydrogen pressure. This liquefaction
route  is  very  costly  due  to  the  type  of  equipment  needed  to  operate  at  these  condi-
tions. The MIT report also states that in general, the direct liquefaction route ‘‘pro-
duces  low-quality  liquid  products  that  are  expensive  to  upgrade  and  do  not  easily
fit current product quality constraints.’’
Indirect Liquefaction Process

As  described  by  the  MIT  Report  the  initial  step  in  the  production  of  methane,
chemicals,  or  liquids  from  coal  is  the  gasification  of  coal  to  produce  a  syngas—this
is  the  same  process  carried  out  in  Integrated  Gasification  Combined  Cycle  (IGCC)
for electricity generation. The synthesis gas, or syngas, (predominantly carbon mon-
oxide and hydrogen) is cleaned of impurities and a water gas shift reaction increases
the  hydrogen  to  carbon  monoxide  ratio.  Then,  a  Fischer-Tropsch  reaction  converts
a  mixture  of  hydrogen  and  carbon  monoxide  to  liquid  fuels.  The  hydrogen  and  car-
bon monoxide can be derived from coal, methane or biomass.
Challenges With CTL

The  MIT  report  states  that  ‘‘Without  CCS  (carbon  dioxide  capture  and  storage),
Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of liquid fuels emits about 150 percent more CO2 as com-
pared  with  the  use  of  crude  oil  derived  products.’’  Requiring  these  facilities  to  cap-
ture and sequester the carbon dioxide will make the synfuels more expensive. How-
ever,  the  MIT  report  also  points  out  that  carbon  capture  and  storage  would  not  re-
quire  major  changes  to  the  synfuels  process  or  significant  energy  penalties  because
the  CO2 is  byproduct  in  an  almost  pure  stream  and  easier  to  capture  and  manage.
In  addition,  questions  have  been  raised  about  the  ability  to  guarantee  a  depend-
able  and  sustained  market  for  coal-to-liquid  fuels  which  could  deter  private-sector
investment.  Specifically,  industry  has  expressed  concern  that  the  uncertainty  of
world oil prices coupled with the technical risks associated with the operation of the
initial commercial plants and the implementation of carbon dioxide management op-
tions will make private investment difficult to obtain.

CTL  plant  costs  will  vary  based  on  location,  capacity,  construction  climate,  prod-
uct slate and coal type. The Fishcer-Tropsch synthesis using coal has been criticized
as inefficient and thus costly. The MIT report concludes, ‘‘Today, the U.S. consumes
about 13 million barrels per day of liquid transportation fuels. To replace 10 percent
of  this  fuels  consumption  with  liquids  from  coal  would  require  over  $70  billion  in
capital  investment  and  about  250  million  tons  of  coal  per  year.  This  would  effec-
tively  require  a  25  percent  increase  in  our  current  coal  production  which  would
come with its own set of challenges.’’
Benefits From CTL

Production of domestic liquid fuel would help secure energy supplies by displacing
imports  of  diesel  or  jet  fuel.  Refiners  cannot  meet  U.S.  demand  for  these  fuels  so
diesel or jet fuel production from CTL facilities would offset imports.

‘‘Unlike  conventional  transportation  fuels,  CTL  fuels,  made  using  an  indirect  liq-
uefaction process, produce tailpipe emissions that are almost completely free of sul-
fur.’’ (Coal International—January/February 2007)

‘‘Carbon dioxide emissions, over the full fuel cycle, can be reduced by as much as
20 person, compared to conventional oil products, through the use of carbon capture
and  storage.’’  (Williams  &  Larson  2003,  Princeton  University,  ‘‘A  comparison  of  di-

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Good  morning.  This  meeting  will  come  to
order.  I  am  pleased  to  welcome  our  panel  of  witnesses  here  this
morning.  As  you  may  recall  during  the—during  our  Committee
markup at the end of June Chairman Gordon committed to holding
a hearing on the topic of liquid fuel production from coal. And I am
pleased that we are able to host such an expert panel of witnesses
today  to  discuss  the  barriers  and  benefits  of  using  our  abundant
coal resources to produce liquid transportation fuels.

I  understand  that  many  supporting  the  coal-to-liquid  technology
do so at least in part because this technology could help to decrease
oil imports. There is no question that we must reduce our reliance
on  foreign  oil  supplies,  and  I  have  worked  to  ensure  the  Federal
Government continues to play a role, a critical role in the develop-
ment of bio-based fuels as an alternative to petroleum for transpor-
tation fuel.

Achieving  greater  energy  independence  will  take  collaborative
work  from  a  range  of  experts.  We  need  to  fully  explore  all  of  our
options  for  diversifying  our  fuel  use.  I  sincerely  hope  that  the  ur-
gency  to  achieve  greater  fuel  supply  diversity,  energy  independ-
ence,  and  fuel  use  efficiency  will  not  lead  us  to  turn  a  blind  eye
toward the pressing issue of global climate change. We have a need
to have a comprehensive strategy to build an energy future that is
sustainable.

And  I  recognize  there  may  be  economic  and  strategic  benefits  of
advancing  coal-to-liquid  technologies  from  both  the  regional  and
the global perspectives. I am also interested in learning more about
the  possibility  of  combining  coal  with  biomass  to  produce  liquid
transportation fuels.

I  further  understand  that  converting  coal  into  transportation

fuels helps reduce the emissions coming from our tailpipes.

However,  I  am  also  aware  that  there  are  significant  environ-
mental  challenges  associates  with  using  coal  to  produce  liquid
fuels.  I  believe  it  is  essential  that  we  continue  to  examine  our  en-
ergy  strategies  with  attention  to  the  issue  of  global  warming  and
other environmental concerns such as management of our water re-
sources.

I am also interested in the price implications of creating a second
market  for  coal  that  will  compete  with  coal’s  use  in  electricity  and
the  electivity  generation  and  in  the  projected  lifespan  of  our  coal
reserves.

We can’t build a coal-to-liquid industry overnight, nor should we
fully  embrace  coal-to-liquid  technology  as  part  of  our  energy  strat-
egy until we have thoroughly examined all of the relevant concerns
and plotted our next steps sensibly and in a manner that puts our
federal resources to good use.

Again, I would like to welcome our witnesses and say that I look
forward to your testimony and your recommendations for the Com-
mittee.

At  this  time  I  would  yield  to  my  distinguished  colleague  from
South  Carolina,  our  Ranking  Member,  Mr.  Inglis,  for  an  opening
statement.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN NICK LAMPSON

I  am  pleased  to  welcome  our  panel  of  witnesses  here  this  morning.  As  you  may

of bio-based fuels as an alternative to petroleum for transportation fuel.

Achieving greater energy independence will take collaborative work from a range

I  sincerely  hope  that  the  urgency  to  achieve  greater  fuel  supply  diversity,  energy
independence and fuel use efficiency will not lead us to turn a blind eye toward the
pressing issue of global climate change.

I  recognize  there  may  be  economic  and  strategic  benefits  of  advancing  coal-to-liq-
uid technologies from both the regional and global perspectives. I am also interested
in learning more about the possibility of combining coal with biomass to produce liq-

I am also interested in the price implications of creating a second market for coal
that  will  compete  with  coal’s  use  in  electricity  generation  and  in  the  projected  life-
span of our coal reserves.

We  cannot  build  a  coal-to-liquid  industry  overnight  and  nor  should  we  fully  em-
brace CTL technology as part of our energy strategy until we have thoroughly exam-
ined  all  of  the  relevant  concerns  and  plotted  our  next  steps  sensibly  and  in  a  man-
ner that puts our federal resources to good use.

Again, I would like to welcome our witnesses and say I look forward to your testi-

intent 

And  this  afternoon  Coca-Cola  and  the  United  Resource  Recovery
Corporation  will  be  announcing 
in
Spartanburg,  South  Carolina  the  largest  bottle-to-bottle  recycling
plant  in  the  world.  The  plant  will  recycle  100  million  pounds  of
plastic for reuse each year, enough plastic to make two billion, 20-
ounce Coca-Cola bottles. That is a lot of Coke.

The  plant  will  bring  jobs  to  the  South  Carolina’s  fourth  district,
require  less  energy  than  producing  bottles  from  unused  materials,
reduce  waste,  and  lessen  carbon  dioxide  emissions  by  one  million
metric tons over the next ten years.

It wasn’t long ago when the best way we knew to deal with waste
from bottles was to dig a hole and bury it. When we found out that
strategy  wasn’t  the  best  use  of  resources,  nor  environmentally
sound, we innovated and started recycling.

I  suppose  that  when  we  first  started  realizing  the  negative  ef-
fects of burying our plastic, someone could have and may have sug-
gested  that  we  just  bury  the  waste  in  a  different  place,  maybe  at
the  bottom  of  the  ocean.  In  retrospect,  it  is  easy  to  see  that  that
approach, while newer looking, was equally problematic.

So,  plastics  are  everywhere,  and  we  learned  how  to  innovate.  In

and  we  have  an  opportunity  to  innovate  to  make  it  the  most  effi-
cient, to make the most efficient use of that resource.

And  coal  is  a  lot  like  those  plastics.  At  one  point  we  thought
burning  it  in  kettle  stoves  was  a  good  way  to  heat  a  home.  Now,
the  challenges  of  carbon  emissions  and  greenhouse  gases  cause  us
to rethink that strategy.

I  am  concerned  that  we  may  be  headed  down  the  wrong  track
here in gasifying coal for transportation use. It makes a lot of sense
to use coal, for example, in Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle
technology  that  is  stationary,  and  it  makes  it  so  we  can  produce
electricity,  and  then  use  that  electricity  in  things  like  plug-in  hy-
brids. And we can also generate hydrogen power out of similar use
of that technology by capturing the hydrogen.

But  I  have  significant  concerns  about  whether  this  is  the  right
path, to make it into a liquid and make it a portable transportation
fuel.  It  seems  to  me  that  there  are  other  portable  transportation
fuels.  We  can’t  put  a  reactor  in  our  trunk,  and  we  can’t  clamp  a
windmill on the back bumper. So we need to find some portable en-
ergy  source  for  our  cars,  and  perhaps  I  could  be  convinced  that
coal-to-liquid is a good idea for transportation purposes, but I come
with  great  skepticism  about  whether  it  would  work  or  whether  it
is desirable.

So  I  look  forward  to  hearing  the  testimony,  and  Mr.  Chairman,

I yield back.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Inglis follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BOB INGLIS

This  afternoon,  Coca-Cola  and  the  United  Resource  Recovery  Corporation  will  be
announcing their intent to build, in Spartanburg, South Carolina, the largest bottle-
to-bottle  recycling  plant  in  the  world.  The  plant  will  recycle  100  million  pounds  of
plastic  for  reuse  each  year—enough  plastic  to  make  two  billion  20-ounce  Coca-Cola
bottles. The plant will bring jobs to the district, require less energy than producing
bottles  from  unused  materials,  reduce  waste,  and  lessen  carbon  dioxide  emissions
by one million metric tons over the next 10 years.

It  wasn’t  that  long  ago  when  the  best  way  we  knew  how  to  deal  with  waste  was
to  dig  a  hole  and  bury  it.  When  we  found  out  that  that  strategy  wasn’t  the  best
use of resources, nor environmentally sound, we innovated and started recycling.

I  suppose  that  when  we  first  started  realizing  the  negative  effects  of  burying  our
plastic,  someone  could  have,  and  may  have,  suggested  that  we  just  bury  the  waste
in  a  different  place—maybe  at  the  bottom  of  the  ocean.  In  retrospect,  it’s  easy  to
see that that approach, while newer looking, was equally problematic.

So,  plastics  are  everywhere,  and  we  learned  how  to  innovate  around  that  reality.
In  the  same  way,  coal  is  a  fact  of  life  in  our  current  energy  situation,  and  we  have
an opportunity to innovate the most efficient uses of that resource.

Coal’s a lot like those plastics. At one point, we thought burning it in kettle-stoves
was a good way to heat a home. Now, the challenges of carbon emissions and green-
house gases cause us to re-think that strategy.

I’m concerned that we may be headed down the wrong track here in gasifying coal
for  transportation  use.  Instead  of  finding  a  different  way  to  burn  coal  out  of  a  dif-
ferent  pipe  (car  exhaust  instead  of  a  factory  smokestack),  there’s  an  opportunity  to
chart  a  new  path.  By  encouraging  Integrated  Gasification  Combined  Cycle  (IGCC)
technology,  we  can  reduce  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil  by  utilizing  our  coal  re-
source.  We  can  address  climate  concerns  by  capturing  and  sequestering  nearly  all
of the carbon emissions. Finally, from that coal, we can produce clean energy—elec-
tricity and hydrogen that can fuel plug-in and hydrogen-powered vehicles.

Before  we  knew  any  better,  we  could  talk  energy  without  talking  about  climate.
We  no  longer  have  that  luxury.  I  hope  that  the  coal  developments  we  encourage
take  both  into  account,  and  support  the  American  innovative  spirit  in  creating  a
new energy economy.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Inglis.
If  there  are  Members  who  wish  to  submit  additional  opening
statements,  your  statements  will  be  added  to  the  record  at  this
point.

Oh,  Mr.  Hall  from  Texas,  we  would  recognize  you  for  five  min-

utes. The Ranking Member on the Full Committee.

Mr.  HALL.  I  am  sorry,  Mr.  Chairman,  to  be  late,  but  I  did  want
to give an opening statement, and I was trying to read it one time
before I gave it.

Chairman LAMPSON. Did you make it?
Mr. HALL. Not quite.
Chairman LAMPSON. All right.
Mr.  HALL.  I  would  like  to  thank  you  for  having  this  very,  very
important  hearing  today.  You  and  I  are  both  from  energy  states,
and we have similar ideas about it. I hope we can get together.

I have stated a lot of times that coal is an important part of our
domestic  energy  mix,  and  it  should  be  and  certainly  it  should  be
continued  to  be  so  through  broadened  use  and  particularly  coal-to-
liquids.

One  of  our  witnesses,  Dr.  Bartis,  states  in  his  testimony  that,
‘‘OPEC  revenues  from  oil  exports  are  about  $700  billion  a  year.’’
$700  billion.  Now,  we  are  handing  countries  like  Venezuela,  Iran,
Libya,  Saudi  Arabia  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars  a  year.  Why?
Well,  because  unfortunately,  there  are  those  in  this  country  that
feel it is better to give $700 billion to unstable foreign governments
than it is to invest in our own country, our own workforce, our own
national security, and our own national independence.

And  so  today  we  are  talking  about  coal-to-liquids  technology,  of
which I have been supportive in this and previous Congresses. Just
this  year  alone,  we  have  attempted  several  times  to  include  com-
mon-sense  language  to  bills  that  have  passed  through  this  com-
mittee  and  onto  the  House  Floor,  language  that  is,  in  fact,  sup-
ported  by  some  of  our  witnesses’  testimony,  but  all  of  which  was
ultimately defeated.

I  know  that  we  have  to  worry  not  only  about  energy  supply  but
also  about  the  effects  of  energy  exploration,  production,  and  con-
sumption  on  our  own  environment.  And  I  have  faith  in  our  sci-
entists and inventors that they will devise ways to increasingly re-
duce  emissions  from  the  energy  life  cycle  of  fossil  fuels.  We  have
to  have  fossil  fuels.  It  is  ridiculous  to  think  we  are  going  to  do
without them or we are about to do without them.

If  we  can  invent  ways  of—for  humans  to  live  in  space,  we  can
continue  to  improve  the  capture  and  sequestration  of  carbon  diox-
ide  and  other  greenhouse  gases.  I  have  said  it  before;  we  should
use  all  domestic  resources  to  arrive  at  energy  independence.  We
need renewable energy and plug-in hybrids, but we also need clean
coal  technology,  nuclear  power,  and  environmentally-responsible
exploration  and  drilling  for  oil  and  natural  gas  on  American  soil
and in American waters.

While we continue R&D into renewable fuels and alternative ve-
hicles,  we  still  need  fossil  fuels  in  order  to  maintain  the  lifestyle
that  we  Americans  deserve  and  that  makes  the  United  States  of
America the greatest country in the world. The alternative is send-

ing  our  young  overseas  to  take  some  energy  away  from  people
when we don’t have to. We have plenty right here at home.

Thank you. I yield back my time to a good Chairman.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Hall follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RALPH M. HALL

Thank  you  Chairman  Lampson.  I  would  like  to  thank  you  for  having  this  very
important  hearing  today.  I  have  stated  many  times  that  coal  is  an  important  part
of our domestic energy mix and that it should continue to be so through broadened
use—in particular, coal-to-liquids.

One  of  our  witnesses,  Dr.  Bartis,  states  in  his  testimony  that,  ‘‘OPEC  revenues
from oil exports are about $700 billion a year.’’ $700 billion a year. We are handing
countries like Venezuela, Iran, Libya, and Saudi Arabia hundreds of billions of dol-
lars  a  year.  Why?  Because  unfortunately,  there  are  those  in  this  country  that  feel
it  is  better  to  give  $700  billion  dollars  to  unstable  foreign  governments  than  it  is
to invest in our own country, our own work force, our national security and our en-
ergy independence.

So today we’re talking about coal-to-liquids technology, of which I have been sup-
portive  in  this  and  previous  Congresses.  Just  this  year  alone,  Republicans  have  at-
tempted, several times, to include common sense language to bills that have passed
through this committee and on the House Floor. Language that is in fact supported
by  some  of  our  witnesses’s  testimony,  but  all  of  which  was  ultimately  defeated  by
the  Majority.  I  know  that  we  have  to  worry  not  only  about  our  energy  supply,  but
also  the  effects  of  energy  exploration,  production  and  consumption  on  our  environ-
ment.  I  have  faith  in  our  scientists  and  inventors  that  they  will  devise  ways  to  in-
creasingly reduce emissions from the energy life cycle of fossil fuels. If we can invent
ways  for  humans  to  live  in  space,  we  can  continue  to  improve  the  capture  and  se-
questration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

I’ve said it before—we need it all. We need renewable energy and plug-in hybrids,
but we also need clean coal technology, nuclear power and environmentally respon-
sible exploration and drilling for oil and natural gas on American soil and in Amer-
ican  waters.  While  we  continue  R&D  into  renewable  fuels  and  alternative  vehicles,
we  still  need  fossil  fuels  in  order  to  maintain  the  lifestyle  that  we  Americans  de-
serve  and  that  makes  the  United  States  of  America  the  greatest  country  in  the
world.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Hall. You did a good job.
Mr. HALL. Would you like me to read it again?
Chairman LAMPSON. Well, the second time could get better.
Mr. HALL. I do really thank you.
Chairman LAMPSON. You are welcome. We thank you.
Now I can say that if there are other Members who want to enter
something  into  the  record,  you  may  do  so,  and  we  will,  it  will  be
done at this point in the record.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good morning. Mr. Chairman, thank you for calling this important hearing to ex-
amine the benefits and challenges of producing liquid fuel from coal and to identify
necessary research to overcome the challenges of converting coal to liquids.

In  the  past  several  months,  Congress  has  focused  on  energy  reform  and  ways  to
address  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil  while  maintaining  a  sound  environment  and
national  economy.  Given  the  volatility  of  the  oil  and  gas  markets,  it  makes  sense
to develop policies that place a greater dependence on domestic resources, and coal-
to-liquids is one way to help achieve this goal.

In  2006,  the  United  States  ranked  as  the  top  world-wide  consumer  of  oil,  con-
suming  20.6  million  barrels  of  oil  per  day  and  importing  12.2  million  barrels  per
day.  China  was  next,  consuming  7.3  million  barrels  per  day  and  importing  3.4  mil-
lion  barrels  per  day.  While  China  still  trails  the  United  States  in  consumption  and
importation  levels,  it  is  dedicating  substantial  amounts  of  funds  to  coal-to-liquids
and other technology in an effort to become more energy independent.

The  United  States  has  an  abundant  supply  of  coal,  and  I  firmly  believe  coal-to-
liquids,  particularly  in  combination  with  carbon  capture  and  storage  (CCS)  and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:08 Apr 21, 2008 Jkt 037639 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\090507\37639 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

11

other  technologies,  is  part  of  the  solution  to  achieving  U.S.  energy  independence,
continued economic prosperity and improved environmental stewardship.

Fuels  produced  by  coal-to-liquids  are  cleaner  than  petroleum-derived  transpor-
tation fuels. Coal-to-liquids plants using CCS can produce fuels with life cycle green-
house  gas  emission  profiles  that  are  as  good  as  or  better  than  that  of  petroleum-
derived products.

In  February,  I  joined  Chairman  Gordon  and  twenty-five  other  House  Democrats
in sending a letter to Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer stating our strong
commitment to advancing the deployment of clean coal technologies, including CCS.
In order for CCS technology to become commercially viable, the Federal Government
must  show  it  is  committed  to  funding  the  necessary  research,  development,  and
demonstration (RD&D) projects.

Mr. Chairman, as you know, I have been a strong advocate for federal coal initia-
tives  and  programs.  I  intend  to  continue  to  work  with  my  colleagues  on  both  sides
of the aisle to ensure we continue to advance clean coal technology to overcome the
technical and economical challenges for coal-based power plants.

To that end, I am glad we are having today’s hearing because it is imperative that
we  understand  the  benefits  and  the  challenges  that  must  be  addressed  for  coal-to-
liquids.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  the  witnesses  on  these  issues,  and  specifi-
cally  their  recommendations  on  necessary  research  and  development  projects  that
would further clarify the benefits and challenges in the deployment of coal-to-liquids
fuels.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Wilson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE CHARLES A. WILSON

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this important hearing. I appreciate having

the opportunity to participate this morning.

I  would  like  to  welcome  today’s  witnesses;  I  look  forward  to  hearing  their  views
on  coal-to-liquid  (CTL)  fuel  technology.  This  hearing  offers  us  a  great  opportunity
to discuss the positive implications of the development of CTL fuel technologies, and
the  role  Congress  can  play  in  helping  this  energy  resource  become  a  viable  option
in the United States.

With  energy  prices  continuing  to  rise,  it  is  vital  that  we  work  to  find  new  tech-
nologies to aide in reducing our nation’s dependence on foreign energy sources. Coal
is our nation’s most abundant resource and must play a role in building our energy
future.

CTL  fuel  conversion  is  a  proven  technology  that  is  currently  in  use  throughout
the world. Coal-to-liquid technologies have been used since World War II, and today,
South  Africa  uses  the  technology  to  produce  approximately  40  percent  of  its  trans-
portation fuels.

In fact, in my district, Baard Energy, L.L.C., is in the development phase of build-
ing  a  35,000  barrel  per  day  coal-to-liquids  facility  in  Wellsville,  Ohio.  The  facility’s
unique  design  and  operation  has  the  potential  to  sequester  up  to  85  percent  of  all
carbon  dioxide  produced,  and  will  be  capable  of  producing  synthetic  jet  fuel,  diesel
fuel and other valued chemical feedstocks. Additionally, the Wellsville facility is es-
timated  to  have  a  major  impact  on  the  regional  economy,  creating  up  to  200  high-
paying plant jobs and 750 new mine jobs.

While  I  understand  that  there  are  some  obstacles  to  coal-to-liquid  fuels,  I  believe
that  they  can  be  overcome  with  the  help  of  the  Federal  Government.  That  being
said,  I  am  excited  to  bring  CTL  research  and  technologies  to  the  forefront  of
Congress’s discussion on energy independence and security. Again, thank you all for
coming  today—I  am  looking  forward  to  hearing  from  you  all  today  and  working  to-
gether in the future.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Bartlett follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE ROSCOE G. BARTLETT

There  are  a  number  of  important  national  security  and  environmental  consider-
ations  involved  with  coal-to-liquids  technologies,  including  global  peak  oil,  a  topic
I  have  discussed  many  times.  This  committee  and  the  Full  House  have  previously
addressed  the  topic  of  coal-to-liquid  (CTL)  technologies  on  a  number  of  occasions.
I appreciate the opportunity to gather a summary of important actions to date into
the record for this hearing.

In  an  effort  to  begin  moving  forward  with  research  and  development  into  using
coal-to-liquids  for  energy  Republicans  in  April  of  this  year  offered  a  Motion  To  Re-
commit  to  H.R.  363,  the  Sowing  the  Seeds  Through  Science  and  Engineering  Re-

search Act. This language authorized the Director of the Office of Science at the De-
partment of Energy when carrying out a program to award grants to scientists and
engineers at the early stage of their careers at institutions of higher education and
research  organizations  to  prioritize  grants  expanding  domestic  energy  production
and  use  through  coal-to-liquids  and  advanced  nuclear  reprocessing.  These  grants
were for up to five years and at least $80,000 per year. This language was accepted
and  approved  on  the  House  Floor  by  a  vote  of  264  to  154.  H.R.  363  including  this
language  went  on  to  pass  the  House  Floor  that  day  by  a  vote  of  397–20.  Further-
more, H.R. 2272, the 21st Century Competitiveness Act of 2007, which combined sev-
eral  Science  and  Technology  competitiveness  bills,  including  H.R.  363,  passed  the
House Floor under suspension of the rules and by voice vote.

At  the  appointment  of  conferees  on  H.R.  2272,  the  21st  Century  Competitiveness
Act of 2007, Ranking Member Hall offered a motion to instruct conferees asking that
the  managers  on  the  part  of  the  House  at  the  conference  on  the  bill  be  instructed
to  insist  on  the  language  prioritizing  the  early  career  grants  to  science  and  engi-
neering  researchers  for  the  expansion  of  domestic  energy  production  and  use
through  coal-to-liquids  technology  and  advanced  nuclear  reprocessing.  This  non-
binding motion passed the House Floor by a vote of 258 to 167.

Just  two  days  later  when  the  conference  report  on  H.R.  2272  came  to  the  Floor,
with  the  coal-to-liquids  language  removed,  a  motion  to  recommit  the  conference  re-
port  with  instructions  using  the  same  language  as  the  motion  to  instruct,  which
passed 258–167 just two days before, was voted down 199–227. In two days, months
of  House  precedent  was  ignored.  I  am  not  sure  why,  but  over  50  of  my  colleagues
switched their vote. I am grateful that today’s hearing will allow us to examine and
discuss the implications of federal support for research and development into the po-
tential for domestic energy to be produced from coal-to-liquids.

In  addition  to  the  actions  taken  by  the  House,  on  June  20,  2007,  a  new  congres-
sionally mandated report from the National Research Council of the National Acad-
emies of Science was released. It recommends an increase of about $144 million an-
nually in new federal funding in a variety of areas to ensure that coal is mined effi-
ciently, safely, and in an environmentally responsible manner. One of the areas the
report  recommended  requires  additional  study  is  estimates  of  the  amount,  location,
and quality of mineable coal. The report indicated that there is enough coal at cur-
rent  rates  of  production  to  meet  anticipated  needs  through  2030,  and  probably
enough  for  100  years.  However,  the  report  concluded  that  it  is  not  possible  to  con-
firm the often-quoted assertion based upon estimates from the mid-1970’s that there
is a sufficient supply for the next 250 years. This range of estimates from 100 years
to  250  years  is  based  upon  current  use  rates.  It  does  not  take  into  account  the  in-
creased  use  rate  that  would  result  from  coal-to-liquids  technologies.  The  report
noted  that  actual  usage  rates  of  coal  could  vary  considerably  depending  upon  any
regulatory  carbon  constraints  imposed  by  federal  legislation  or  international  agree-
ments.

I  look  forward  to  the  testimony  of  today’s  witnesses  about  the  pros  and  cons  of
proposals  concerning  the  production  of  synthetic  transportation  fuels  from  coal  and
the appropriate role of Federal Government involvement in any such efforts.

STATEMENT OF DR. ROBERT L. FREERKS, DIRECTOR,

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, RENTECH, INC.

Dr.  FREERKS.  Thank  you.  Good  morning.  I  am  Dr.  Robert
Freerks, Director of Product Development for Rentech. I am a syn-
thetic  organic  chemist  with  26  years  experience  in  the  science  of
fuels and for the past eight years have been working on producing
synthetic  jet  fuel  and  diesel  fuel,  utilizing  the  Fischer-Tropsch  (F–
T) process.

Rentech  is  one  of  the  world’s  leading  developers  of  Fischer-
Tropsch  technologies  with  25  years  experience  building  and  oper-
ating  five  plants.  Our  plant  designs  are  a  straightforward  applica-
tion  of  proven  commercial  components.  The  process  first  takes  any
carbon source, gasifies it to producing gas, which is fed to Fischer-
Tropsch’s  reactor,  and  the  raw  F–T  products  are  processed  into
chemical feedstocks, diesel, jet fuel, and NAPTHA.

The  process  captures  CO2 and  other  contaminants  at  several
stages. F–T can be a significant element of the solution for the dual
energy  challenges  facing  America,  dependence  on  imported  crude
oil,  and  the  need  to  reduce  our  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Given
the  abundance  of  domestic  feedstocks  and  the  proven  track  record
of the technology, F–T fuels can greatly help reduce oil imports and
Rentech will lead the way.

Along  with  our  commitment  to  energy  security,  Rentech  is  dedi-
cated  to  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  CO2 capture  is  inher-
ent in the Rentech process, although the only obstacle to significant
carbon  emissions  reductions  is  sequestration.  Rentech  has  teamed
with  Denbury  Resources,  a  company  that  is  leading  in  the  way  on
CO2 sequestration and enhanced oil recovery (EOR).

When used for EOR, CO2 from the production of one barrel of F–
T  fuel  yields  an  additional  barrel  of  oil  for  marginal  oil  fuels,  re-
sulting  in  a  two-for-one  domestic  energy  benefit.  Rentech  fuels  are
the cleanest liquid transportation fuels available.

As  you  can  see  from  the  containers  in  front  of  you,  the  fuels  are
clearer, they smell like wax, they contain essentially no sulfur and
aromatics,  they  are  non-toxic,  biodegradable,  and  completely  com-
patible with the fuel distribution system in engines.

The DOD, a leader in this area, has found F–T fuels to meet vir-
tually all of their environmental and performance requirements, in-
cluding  significant  particulate  matter  reductions  up  to  96  percent,
reduce  CO2 emissions,  and  higher  performance  in  advanced  air-
craft.

Last month the Air Force certified its entire B–52 fleet to run on
a 50/50 blend of F–T jet fuel with conventional jet fuel, and we look
forward  to  2011,  when  that  certification  is  extended  to  the  entire
fleet.

Today  the  barriers  to  building  large  scale  coal  and  pet  coke  fed
F–T  facilities  are  purely  financial.  Oil  price  volatility  continues  to
discourage  potential  F–T  investors.  Congress  should  enact  policies
to help reduce risk and encourage investment in these plants. And

I refer to my written statement for our recommendations including
a regulatory and legal framework for CO2 sequestration.

Also, as our nation enters into a regulatory regime for managing
CO2 emissions, it will be critical that the system established to ac-
count  for  man-made  CO2 is  beyond  reproach.  This  committee
should  take  the  leadership  role  in  forcing  the  development  of  a
modern,  comprehensive,  and  universal  model  for  assessing  the  life
cycle greenhouse gas emissions for all fuels. Such a life cycle anal-
ysis  should  consider  the  latest  production  technologies  and  proc-
esses, the energy inputs throughout the production of the raw ma-
terial,  and  through  the  distribution  to  the  point  of  sale,  including
those  of  imported  oil  and  other  fuels  and  the  emissions  associated
with their use.

What I have discussed so far is the current state of coal-to-liquid

(CTL) technology. What I want to discuss next is the future.

As  I  described  above,  the  first  step  in  our  process  is  gasification
of the feedstock to produce gas for use in our F–T reactor. Rentech
is in the early stages of developing the next generation of our proc-
ess, biomass to liquids (BTL). Unlike CTL, which has been utilized
commercially  for  decades,  commercialization  of  BTL  faces  near-
term hurdles. Current biomass gasification technology is not nearly
as  advanced  as  that  of  coal  gasification.  Most  manufacturers  are
just  now  investigating  the  ability  of  their  systems  to  accept  bio-
mass along with coal.

Advancing  new  biomass  gasification  and  co-feed  technologies
could  be  greatly  expedited  with  federal  support.  Biomass  gasifi-
cation works, and it is our objective to integrate it into our produc-
tion process in progressively-increasing percentages. But for a com-
pany  such  as  Rentech  or  any  of  the  other  U.S.-based  F–T  fuel  de-
velopers  and  their  investors,  such  risks  are  not  financeable  at  this
time.

Congress can help advance the technology of BTL through the es-
tablishment of a loan or grant program to allow commercial opera-
tors  to  acquire  gasifiers  that  can  be  dedicated  to  testing  various
forms of biomass over extended periods and growing season.

Once  biomass  has  been  proven  as  a  viable  commercial  feedstock
for  F–T  plants  and  the  plants  are  connected  to  carbon  sequestra-
tion opportunities such as EOR, as is our Natchez plant, then it is
entirely  realistic  to  envision  a  process  that  absorbs  CO2 from  the
atmosphere  and  stores  it  underground.  This  would  move  transpor-
tation  fuels  and  coal  from  being  a  producer  of  greenhouse  gasses
to  being  a  net  part  of  the  solution.  We  view  this  as  the  game
changer, not only for Rentech, but for our nation.

Thank  you  very  much  for  the  opportunity  to  address  the  Sub-
committee  today,  and  I  look  forward  to  answering  any  questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT L. FREERKS

Honorable  Members  of  the  House  of  Representatives  Committee  on  Science  and
Technology,  Subcommittee  on  Energy  and  Environment,  thank  you  for  the  oppor-
tunity  to  testify  today  on  the  benefits  and  challenges  of  producing  fuels  from  coal.
I am Dr. Robert Freerks, Director of Product Development for Rentech, Inc. For the
past  eight  years  I  have  been  working  on  processes  for  the  production  of  synthetic
jet  and  diesel  fuels  from  alternative  resources  utilizing  the  Fischer-Tropsch  (F–T)
process. My educational background is in synthetic organic chemistry and I have 26
years experience in fuels and related technologies.

Rentech  is  one  of  the  world’s  leading  developers  of  Fischer-Tropsch  technologies.
As  such,  it  is  the  company’s  vision  to  develop  technology  and  projects  to  transform
underutilized hydrocarbon resources such as coal, petroleum coke, remote or strand-
ed  natural  gas  and  biomass  and  municipal  waste  into  valuable  clean  fuels  and
chemicals that will help accommodate our nation’s growing energy needs. Our com-
pany has been in the business of developing alternative and renewable energy tech-
nologies  for  more  than  25  years,  having  been  initially  affiliated  with  the  Solar  En-
ergy  Research  Institute  which  became  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory
in  Golden,  Colorado.  Rentech’s  focus  is  on  the  technology  for  converting  synthesis
gas,  carbon  monoxide  and  hydrogen,  into  ultra  clean  synthetic  diesel  and  jet  fuels
via the Fischer-Tropsch process followed by hydroprocessing.

The goal of our efforts is to demonstrate the viability of this technology for diverse
alternative  feedstock  materials  into  fungible  transportation  fuels  in  volumes  great
enough  to  reduce  importation  of  crude  oil  and  refined  fuel  products.  Currently  the
United  States  imports  approximately  65  percent  of  our  crude  oil  and  fuel  products.
Conversion  of  biomass  into  first  generation  biofuels  is  estimated  by  EIA  to  provide
only  11.2  billion  gallons  in  2012  per  year  or  458,000  barrels  of  oil  equivalent  per
day, which would account for about 2.3 percent of today’s consumption of 20 million
barrels per day. The largest plants will have a capacity of no more than about 7,000
barrels  per  day.  Rentech’s  first  plant  will  produce  30,000  barrels  each  day  or  460
million gallons per year, and it will be scalable to more than 80,000 barrels per day.
Rentech  is  well  aware  of  the  dual  energy  problems  facing  America:  The  need  for
independence  from  imported  crude  oil;  and  the  need  to  reduce  the  greenhouse  gas
(GHG)  footprint  of  these  fuels.  First  I’d  like  to  briefly  address  energy  security.  As
a  company  we  believe  that  the  U.S.  cannot  achieve  energy  independence  without
utilization of its many diverse natural resources, including both renewable and fossil
fuels. Given the current level of our dependence upon imported oil we must consider
all  realistic  options  in  solving  this  problem.  But  achieving  this  goal  will  take  guid-
ance  and  support  from  the  Federal  Government  to  protect  investors  from  the  con-
sequences  market  manipulation  by  the  oil  cartel.  We  must  remember  that  the  oil
markets are not free markets and it is not unreasonable to believe that if we begin
to  succeed  in  ending  our  addiction  to  foreign  oil,  the  nations  that  produce  it  will
try  to  undermine  our  efforts  at  energy  independence  by  cutting  prices.  Relying  on
affordable, abundant domestic coal helps to mitigate strategic concerns, but does not
eliminate the risk of a price cut intended sustain our addiction to imported oil.

The benefits to the U.S. in terms of energy security, balance of payments, and the
establishment  of  the  new  CTL  technology  base  with  an  associated  increase  in  jobs
will  be  substantial  and  obvious.  Projects  that  Rentech  is  developing  are  located  in
economically  challenged  areas  such  as  our  proposed  plant  in  Natchez,  Mississippi,
and  our  conversion  of  a  fertilizer  plant  in  East  Dubuque,  Illinois.  Our  hope  is  that
Washington  will  make  a  long-term  commitment  to  a  broad  suite  of  alternative  en-
ergy solutions; including those utilizing our abundant coal reserves, but that encour-
ages cooperative efforts across segments of the alternative fuels industry.

Second,  Rentech  is  committed  to  developing  and  deploying  technologies  and  proc-
esses  that  reduce  the  GHG  emissions  associated  with  both  the  production  and  use
of  our  fuels.  We  have  assembled  a  Carbon  Leadership  Team  to  address  the  overall
carbon  footprint  of  fuels  production  using  Rentech’s  F–T  technology.  This  team
which  includes  all  senior  executives,  staff  scientists  and  engineers  has  committed
the  company  to  being  a  leader  in  reduction  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions  from  our
projects.  A  CO2 solution  is  a  key  decision  criterion  in  advancing  a  project.  The
Rentech plant design already incorporates carbon capture as an integral part of the
process, the only obstacle to significant carbon emissions reductions is sequestration
of the captured carbon dioxide.

But our commitment to CO2 management does not stop at the fence. Rentech has
already  established  relationships  with  companies  that  transport  and  sequester  CO2
using existing Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) technologies that have been proven for
over 20 years. EOR in conjunction with F–T fuels production will increase available
energy  by  approximately  one  barrel  of  crude  for  every  barrel  of  F–T  fuel  produced,
increasing oil production from existing North American fields and further improving
our  nation’s  energy  security.  Pipelines  already  exist  for  the  transportation  of  CO2
in  several  areas  of  the  country  and  plans  are  being  formulated  to  extend  pipeline
capabilities  to  cover  significant  areas  of  the  central  and  eastern  U.S.  Rentech  has
partnered  with  Denbury  Resources  to  supply  CO2 to  several  locations  for  EOR  se-
questration.  One  sequestration  site  is  the  Gulf  Coast  Stacked  Storage  project  in
Cranfield,  Mississippi,  part  of  the  Southeast  Regional  Carbon  Sequestration  Part-
nership  (SECARB),  a  public-private  partnership  dedicated  to  the  development  and
deployment of carbon sequestration solutions.

But  the  benefits  of  Rentech’s  fuels  are  not  limited  to  CO2.  Rentech  fuels  will  be
the  cleanest  liquid  transportation  fuels  available.  F–T  diesel  and  jet  fuel  are  pure
paraffinic hydrocarbons. This means that they inherently contain essentially no sul-
fur and aromatics, two fuel components that have long been the focus of federal and
State environmental protection policies. The fuels are clear, non-toxic, biodegradable
and  completely  fungible  with  current  fuels  and  fuel  transportation  infrastructure.
This  means  that  no  changes  are  needed  to  fuel  distribution  pipelines  or  engines  to
use F–T diesel and jet fuel. (A comparison of the life cycle CO2 emissions from diesel
fuels  produced  from  coal  to  diesel  fuels  produced  from  several  different  qualities  of
crude oil is shown below as Figure 1.)

The  Department  of  Defense  has  been  a  leader  in  advancing  the  development  of
a U.S.-based Fischer-Tropsch fuels industry. As part of several conjoined programs,
the  Department  is  seeking  to  encourage  the  development  of  a  domestic  alternative
fuels  industry  that  can  provide  a  reliable  source  of  fuel  for  their  aircraft,  tanks,
ships and other vehicles while reducing emissions. For the sake of simplifying logis-
tics, these initiatives also aim to reduce the multiple types of fuels that our military
must carry to the battlefield—approximately nine. This new fuel also must be capa-
ble  of  being  stored,  transported  and  distributed  using  existing  infrastructure.  Only
fuels  produced  using  the  Fischer-Tropsch  process  are  able  to  meet  all  of  these  re-
quirements.

Through the Assured Fuels Initiative the Air Force has tested F–T jet fuel in mul-
tiple  applications  from  a  diesel  engine  powered  HMMWV  (Hummer)  to  a  B–52
bomber.  Last  month,  the  Air  Force  certified  its  entire  B–52  fleet  to  fly  on  a  50/50
blend of F–T jet fuel and conventional jet fuel, and is progressing on extending that
certification to all its aircraft by 2011. (See Figure 2 below for a comparison of par-
ticulate  emissions  from  a  turbine  engine  using  blends  of  conventional  and  synthetic
Fischer-Tropsch  jet  fuels.  Figure  3  illustrates  the  DOD  view  of  the  future  use  of  F–
T jet fuel in a multitude of applications.)

Commercial aviation is also progressing towards full acceptance of F–T jet fuel in
general  aviation  aircraft.  The  Federal  Aviation  Administration  is  supporting  the
Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative (CAAFI) which will oversee the ef-
forts  to  approve  the  use  of  blends  of  F–T  fuel  with  conventional  jet  fuel.  This  fuel
is  already  in  use  in  South  Africa  and  all  planes  flying  out  of  Johannesburg  Inter-
national  Airport  have  been  using  a  blend  of  F–T  jet  fuel  and  conventional  jet  fuel
for  seven  years,  including  Delta  Air  Lines  that  recently  initiated  service  from  At-
lanta.

F–T  fuels  offer  numerous  benefits  for  aviation  users.  The  first  is  an  immediate
reduction  in  particulate  emissions.  F–T  jet  fuel  has  been  shown  in  laboratory  com-
bustors  and  engines  to  reduce  PM  emissions  by  96  percent  at  idle  and  78  percent
under  cruise  operation.  Validation  of  the  reduction  in  other  turbine  engine  emis-
sions is still under way. Concurrent to the PM reductions is an immediate reduction
in CO2 emissions from F–T fuel. F–T fuels inherently reduce CO2 emissions because
they have higher energy content per carbon content of the fuel, and the fuel is less
dense  than  conventional  jet  fuel  allowing  aircraft  to  fly  further  on  the  same  load
of fuel.

The fuel also offers increased turbine engine life through lowered peak combustion
temperature.  This  reduces  stress  on  hot  components  in  the  turbine  engine  thereby
increasing the life of those components. Fuels that burn cooler may also help to re-
duce the heat signature of aircraft, making them less vulnerable to infrared missile
attacks.  (Figure  3  shows  some  of  the  many  applications  for  F–T  jet  fuel  in  military
equipment ranging from tanks to fuel cells to spacecraft.) Also critical to meeting the
needs  of  aviation,  F–T  fuels  are  truly  ‘‘drop-in  replacements’’  for  their  petroleum-
based  counterparts,  requiring  no  new  pipelines,  storage  facilities,  or  engine  modi-
fications, barriers that have stalled other alternative aviation fuels programs.

Another advantage to F–T fuels is the maturity of the technology. Rentech’s plant
designs  are  a  relatively  straight  forward  application  of  existing,  proven  commercial
components  that  can  provide  reliable  production  of  liquid  hydrocarbon  fuel  and
chemical  products.  The  process  first  takes  a  carbon  source  such  as  coal,  gasifies  it
to carbon monoxide and hydrogen (known as synthesis gas or syngas), removes con-
taminants from this syngas including carbon dioxide, and captures energy from that
process  for  electricity  production.  The  purified  syngas  is  then  fed  to  a  Fischer-
Tropsch  reactor  where  the  carbon  monoxide  and  hydrogen  are  converted  to  hydro-
carbons. At this stage, additional carbon dioxide is captured from the recycle stream
and  prepared  for  sequestration.  The  raw  F–T  products  are  further  processed  into
chemical  feedstocks,  diesel,  jet  fuel  and  naphtha  using  conventional  refining  and
distillation technologies. (See Figure 4 for a simplified process flow diagram.)

Today,  the  barriers  to  building  large  scale  commercial  F–T  facilities  that  can  cut
into the volume of imported oil are purely financial. The history of the energy busi-

17

ness,  particularly  the  oil  industry,  is  marked  by  volatility.  Investors  have  long
memories  and,  as  has  been  said  before,  ‘‘capital  is  cowardly.’’  Many  who  are  inter-
ested  in  investing  in  alternative  energy  production  are  looking  to  Washington  to
provide  some  level  of  certainty.  The  cost  of  a  30,000  to  40,000  barrel  per  day  F–
T plant is estimated in the $3 to $6 billion range, numbers that are often associated
with  large  traditional  refineries  or  power  plants,  not  alternative  energy  production.
Federal  policies  and  programs  that  can  help  to  provide  the  needed  certainty  can
take several forms. The first, and most natural, would be for the Department of De-
fense  to  enter  into  long-term  supply  contracts  with  F–T  fuel  producers.  There  are
several bipartisan proposals to enable this, including extension of the Department’s
contracting authority from its current five-year limit to 25 years. Next would be the
establishment  of  a  program  similar  to  that  proposed  by  Representatives  Boucher
and Shimkus to create a ‘‘price collar’’ program which would protect producers from
a  dramatic  drop  in  oil  prices  and  taxpayers  through  a  revenue  sharing  mechanism
when prices exceed a certain level.

Extending the extending the existing alternative fuels excise tax credit, which cov-
ers  F–T  fuels  and  is  set  to  expire  in  the  fall  of  2009,  to  2020  would  also  provide
a level of protection for investors from potential OPEC price manipulation intended
to undermine U.S. alternative energy programs.

The  next  area  that  the  Federal  Government  can  assist  in  is  providing  regulatory
certainty  with  respect  to  CO2 sequestration.  The  DOE  should  encourage  the  explo-
ration  of  options  for  managing  industrial  CO2 and  the  Federal  Government  should
assume responsibility for geologically sequestered CO2.

As our nation enters into a regulatory regime for managing CO2 emissions, it will
also  be  critical  that  the  system  that  is  established  to  account  for  manmade  CO2 is
beyond reproach. This committee should take a leadership role in forcing the devel-
opment of a modern, comprehensive and universal model for assessing the life cycle
greenhouse gas emissions for all fuels. Such a life cycle analysis should consider the
latest  production  technologies  and  processes,  the  energy  inputs  throughout  produc-
tion  of  the  raw  material  through  fuel  distribution  to  the  point  of  sale,  including
those of imported oil and other fuels, and the emissions associated with its use. This
model  should  be  applicable  across  all  fuel  types  and  not  tailored  to  consider  only
the emissions of a few.

With  the  exception  of  improving  life  cycle  analysis  science,  all  of  the  incentives
that  I  have  listed  are  to  advance  deployment  of  F–T  technology  rather  than  to  ad-
vance  the  state  of  it.  To  repeat,  our  current  hurdles  are  financial  much  more  than
technical.  But  as  I  described  above,  the  first  step  in  our  process  is  the  gasification
of  a  feedstock,  either  coal  or  petroleum  coke,  to  produce  synthetic  natural  gas  for
use  in  our  F–T  reactor.  While  coal  and  pet  coke  are  the  feedstock  of  choice  today
that  does  not  forever  have  to  be  the  case.  As  a  company  we  are  agnostic  on  what
feedstock  we  use,  as  long  as  it  works.  Rentech  is  in  the  early  stages  of  developing
the next generation of our process—biomass-to-liquids. Unlike CTL, which has been
utilized  commercially  for  decades,  commercialization  of  BTL  faces  near-term  hur-
dles.  Current  gasification  technology  manufacturers  and  operators  have  limited  or
no  experience  with  biomass  gasification  on  a  commercial  scale.  Some  are  just  now
investigating  their  ability  to  feed  biomass  along  with  coal  and  there  is  no  estimate
yet available for how much biomass could be fed without upsetting the design of the
gasifier.

Advancing  new  biomass  gasification  technologies  could  be  greatly  expedited  with
federal support to attract investment. Biomass gasification works and it is our objec-
tive, moving forward, to prove technologies and processes that allow for an increas-
ing  percentage  of  our  feedstock  to  come  from  biomass.  Congress  can  help  advance
the  technology  of  BTL  through  the  establishment  of  loan  or  grant  programs  ex-
pressly  to  allow  commercial  operators  to  acquire  gasifiers  that  can  be  dedicated  to
testing  various  forms  of  biomass  over  extended  periods  and  growing  seasons.  Cou-
pled with carbon sequestration this holds great potential to help move fuels produc-
tion from a process that emits CO2 to one that absorbs CO2. But for a company such
as Rentech, or any of the other U.S. based F–T fuels developers and their investors,
such risks are not financeable at this time.

There  is  also  a  role  for  the  Federal  Government  in  assessing  the  regional  avail-
ability of various biomass supplies. It is currently not known how much biomass will
be available in any given location without disrupting the ecology of that area or im-
pacting food supply. It is always assumed that biomass is readily available, but few
studies exist to show that supplying biomass to a major fuels production facility can
be  accomplished  on  a  sound  economic  basis  and  that  this  supply  can  be  sustained
for  an  extended  time  period.  Congress  should  study  of  the  availability  and  cost  of
biomass  in  several  areas  of  the  U.S.  where  CTL  plants  could  be  located.  The  sus-
tainable  availability  of  biomass  at  some  level  is  needed  if  biomass  is  to  be  used  to

reduce  the  overall  carbon  footprint  of  a  CTL  facility.  There  have  been  assertions
that  specific  levels  of  biomass  co-feeds  are  possible.  These  will  remain  academic
theories until these questions are answered.

Once  biomass  has  been  proven  as  a  viable  commercial  feedstock  for  F–T  plants
and  plants  are  connected  to  carbon  sequestration  opportunities  such  as  EOR,  as  is
our  Natchez  plant,  then  it  is  entirely  realistic  to  envision  a  process  that  extracts
CO2 from  the  atmosphere  and  stores  it  underground.  This  would  move  transpor-
tation fuels from being a contributor to global warming to being part of the solution.
We view this as a ‘‘game changer’’ not only for Rentech but for our nation.

Thank you very much for the opportunity to address the Subcommittee today and

I look forward to answering any questions you may have for me.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  JOHN  N.  WARD,  VICE  PRESIDENT,  MAR-
KETING  AND  GOVERNMENT  AFFAIRS,  HEADWATERS  INCOR-
PORATED
Mr.  WARD.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee,  I  am  John  Ward,  Vice  President  of  Headwaters  Incor-
porated, on whose behalf I am testifying today. I am the Immediate
Past President of the American Coal Council and also serve on the
National Coal Council as appointed by the Secretary of Energy.

Headwaters  is  a  member  of  the  Coal-to-Liquids  Coalition,  which
is  a  broad  group  of  industry,  labor,  energy  technology  developers,
and  consumer  groups.  This  coalition  is  interested  in  strengthening
U.S. energy independence through the greater utilization of domes-
tic coal to produce clean transportation fuels.

The  prospect  of  making  liquid  transportation  fuels  from  Amer-
ica’s  abundant  coal  resources  has  received  significant  attention  in
recent  months,  and  as  with  any  high-profile  policy  debate,  this
means  many  misconceptions  have  arisen.  It  may  be  best  at  this
point  to  summarize  what  coal-to-liquids  is  by  pointing  out  what  it
is not.

First  of  all,  coal-to-liquids  is  not  a  new  kind  of  fuel.  Any  liquid
fuel  product  that  can  be  made  from  crude  oil  can  be  made  from
coal. Products from coal-to-liquids plants include high quality gaso-
line,  diesel  fuel,  and  jet  fuel  that  can  be  used  in  the  existing  en-
gines  without  modification  of  those  engines  and  can  be  distributed
through out existing fuel distribution systems.

Second  of  all,  coal-to-liquids  is  not  dirty.  In  fact,  fuels  produced
by  today’s  coal-to-liquids  processes  are  exceptionally  clean  when
compared  to  today’s  petroleum-derived  fuels.  Coal-to-liquid  fuels
contain substantially no sulfur. They also exhibit lower particulate
and carbon monoxide emissions. These fuels also contribute less to
the  formation  of  nitrogen  oxides  than  petroleum-derived  fuels,  and
they are readily biodegradable.

As  for  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  coal-to-liquids  refineries  gen-
erate  carbon  dioxide  in  highly-concentrated  form,  allowing  for  car-
bon  capture  and  storage.  Coal-to-liquids  refineries  with  carbon  di-

21

oxide  capture  and  storage  can  produce  fuels  with  life  cycle  green-
house gas emissions profiles that are as good as or better than the
petroleum fuels that they replace.

And finally, coal-to-liquids is not strictly a research and develop-
ment  effort.  The  term  ‘‘coal-to-liquids’’  refers  to  a  broad  class  of
technologies for making liquid transportation fuels from coal. Many
of these technologies have been known for decades. Many are being
deployed at commercial scale in other parts of the world. And like-
wise,  carbon  capture  and  storage  technologies  are  currently  being
practiced  at  commercial  scale  for  enhanced  oil  recovery  operations
in many locations around the globe.

As  the  Federal  Government  considers  measures  to  support  coal-
to-liquids, it is important to provide two different types of support.
First, commercialization incentives are needed to speed the com-
mercial deployment of coal-to-liquids facilities in the United States
with the goal of increasing our nation’s energy security.

Second, research support is needed to continue to improve the ef-
ficiency  and  environmental  performance  of  coal-to-liquids  tech-
nologies,  with  the  goal  of  making  this  already  clean  resource  even
cleaner.

Specific  areas  where  continued  research  and  development  sup-
port would be beneficial include: number one, utilization of biomass
as a strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Number  two,  improving  life  cycle  assessment  tools  for  deter-
mining  greenhouse  gas  emissions  profiles  for  coal-to-liquids  facili-
ties when compared to other fossil fuel energy sources.

And  number  three,  expanding  methods  of  carbon  capture  and
storage  beyond  the  currently  available  opportunities  in  the  area  of
enhanced oil recovery.

The  advantages  to  developing  a  coal-to-liquids  capability  in  the
United States are numerous, and some of the dollars we now send
overseas  to  buy  oil  would  be  kept  at  home  to  develop  American
jobs, utilizing American energy resources. We would expand and di-
versify our liquid fuels production and refining capacity using tech-
nologies that are already proven.

We  would  produce  clean-burning  fuels  that  can  be  distributed
through our existing pipelines and service stations to fuel our exist-
ing vehicles with no modifications to their engines. We would take
a real and immediate step toward greater energy security.

Thank  you  for  the  invitation  to  testify  and  your  interest  in  this

important topic. I would be happy to answer any questions.

Summary of Testimony

The  prospect  of  making  liquid  transportation  fuels  from  America’s  abundant  coal
resources has received significant attention in recent months. As with any high pro-
file policy debate, this means that many misconceptions have arisen. It may be best,
at this point, to summarize what ‘‘Coal-to-Liquids’’ is by pointing out what it is not:
• Coal-to-liquids  is  not  a  new  kind  of  fuel.  Any  liquid  fuel  product  that  can  be
made  from  crude  oil  can  be  made  from  coal.  Products  from  coal-to-liquids
plants include high quality gasoline, diesel fuel, and jet fuel that can be used
in  existing  engines  without  making  any  modifications  to  the  engines  or  dis-
tribution systems for the fuel.
• Coal-to-liquids is not dirty. In fact, fuels produced by coal-to-liquids processes
are exceptionally clean when compared to today’s petroleum-derived transpor-
tation  fuels.  Coal-to-liquids  fuels  contain  substantially  no  sulfur  and  also  ex-
hibit  lower  particulate  and  carbon  monoxide  emissions.  These  fuels  also  con-
tribute  less  to  the  formation  of  nitrogen  oxides  than  petroleum  derived  fuels
and  they  are  readily  biodegradable.  As  for  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  coal-to-
liquids  refineries  generate  carbon  dioxide  in  highly  concentrated  form  allow-
ing carbon capture and storage. Coal-to-liquids refineries with carbon dioxide
capture and storage can produce fuels with life cycle greenhouse gas emission
profiles that are as good as or better than that of the petroleum-derived prod-
ucts they replace.
• Coal-to-liquids  is  not  strictly  a  research  and  development  effort.  The  term
‘‘coal-to-liquids’’ refers to a broad class of technologies for making liquid trans-
portation  fuels  from  coal.  Many  of  these  technologies  have  been  known  for
decades  and  many  are  being  deployed  at  commercial  scale  around  the  world.
Likewise,  carbon  capture  and  storage  technologies  are  currently  being  prac-
ticed at commercial scale for enhanced oil recovery operations.

As the Federal Government considers measures to support coal-to-liquids, it is im-

portant to provide two different types of support:

• Commercialization incentives are needed to speed the commercial deployment
of coal-to-liquids facilities in the United States with the goal of increasing our
nation’s energy security.
• Research support is needed to continue to improve the efficiency and environ-
mental  performance  of  coal-to-liquids  technologies  with  the  goal  of  making
this already clean resource even cleaner.

Specific areas where continued research and development support would be bene-

ficial include:

• Utilization  of  biomass  as  a  strategy  for  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions.
• Improving  life  cycle  assessment  tools  for  determining  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions  profiles  for  coal-to-liquids  facilities  when  compared  to  other  fossil  fuel
energy sources.
• Expanding methods of carbon capture and storage beyond currently available

opportunities in the area of enhanced oil recovery.

Why Coal-to-Liquids?

It’s  easy  to  see  why  coal-to-liquids  is  attracting  so  much  attention  these  days.  In
the  President’s  words,  the  United  States  is  addicted  to  oil.  U.S.  petroleum  imports
in  2005  exceeded  $250  billion.  In  the  past  two  years,  natural  disasters  have  dis-
rupted oil production and refining on the U.S. gulf coast. Political instability in the
Middle  East  and  other  oil  producing  regions  is  a  constant  threat.  Fuel  prices  have
rapidly  escalated  along  with  world  oil  prices  that  are  reaching  levels  unseen  since
the 1970s energy crisis.

The  situation  is  not  likely  to  get  much  better  in  the  future.  Global  oil  demand
was 84.3 million barrels per day in 2005. The United States consumed 20.7 million
barrels  per  day  (24.5  percent)  and  imported  13.5  million  barrels  per  day  of  petro-
leum products. Worldwide demand for petroleum products is expected to increase 40
percent  by  2025  largely  due  to  growing  demand  in  China  and  India.  World  oil  pro-
duction  could  peak  before  2025.  Most  of  the  remaining  conventional  world  oil  re-
serves are located in politically unstable countries.

In  contrast,  coal  remains  the  most  abundant  fossil  fuel  in  the  world  and  the
United  States  has  more  coal  reserves  than  any  other  country.  With  coal-to-liquids
technology,  the  United  States  can  take  control  of  its  energy  destiny.  Any  product
made from oil can be made from coal. At today’s oil prices, coal-to-liquids is economi-
cal  and  has  the  power  to  enhance  energy  security,  create  jobs  here  at  home,  lessen
the  U.S.  trade  deficit,  and  provide  environmentally  superior  fuels  that  work  in  to-
day’s vehicles. By building even a few coal-to-liquids plants, the U.S. would increase
and  diversify  its  domestic  production  and  refining  base—adding  spare  capacity  to
provide a shock absorber for price volatility.
Coal-to-Liquids Historical Perspective

Headwaters and its predecessors have been engaged in coal-to-liquids technologies
since  the  late  1940s.  Our  alternative  fuels  division  is  comprised  of  the  former  re-
search  and  development  arm  of  Husky  Oil  and  holds  approximately  two  dozen  pat-
ents and patents pending related to coal-to-liquids technologies.

The  founders  of  this  group  included  scientists  engaged  in  the  Manhattan  Project
during  World  War  II.  After  the  conclusion  of  the  war,  these  scientists  were  dis-
patched to Europe to gather information on technologies used by Germany to make
gasoline and diesel fuel from coal during the war.

In the late 1940s, this group designed the first high temperature Fischer-Tropsch
conversion  plant  which  operated  from  1950  to  1955  in  Brownsville,  Texas.  It  pro-
duced  liquid  fuels  commercially  at  a  rate  of  7,000  barrels  per  day.  Why  did  it  shut
down? The discovery of cheap oil in Saudi Arabia.

The  Arab  oil  embargo  of  1973  reignited  interest  in  using  domestic  energy  re-
sources  such  as  coal  for  producing  transportation  fuels.  From  1975  to  2000,  Head-
waters researchers were prime developers of direct coal liquefaction technology. This
effort,  which  received  more  than  $3  billion  of  federal  research  funding,  led  to  the
completion  of  an  1,800  barrels  per  day  demonstration  plant  in  Catlettsburg,  Ken-
tucky.  Why  did  deployment  activities  cease  there?  OPEC  drove  oil  prices  to  lows
that left new technologies unable to enter the market and compete.

Today,  our  nation  finds  itself  in  another  energy  crisis.  Oil  costs  more  than  $70
per barrel and comes predominantly from unstable parts of the world. There is little
spare  production  and  refining  capacity  and  our  refineries  are  concentrated  in  areas
susceptible  to  natural  disasters  or  terrorist  attacks.  And  once  again,  our  nation  is
considering  coal  as  a  source  for  liquid  transportation  fuels.  The  question  is:  What
can we do this time to ensure that the technologies are fully deployed?
Coal-to-Liquids Technology Overview

From  a  product  perspective,  coal-to-liquids  refineries  are  very  similar  to  petro-
leum  refineries.  They  make  the  same  range  of  products,  including  gasoline,  diesel
fuel, jet fuel and chemical feedstocks. These fuels can be distributed in today’s pipe-
lines without modification. They can be blended with petroleum derived fuels if de-
sired. They can be used directly in today’s cars, trucks, trains and airplanes without
modifications to the engines.

From  a  production  perspective,  coal-to-liquids  refineries  utilize  technologies  that
have been commercially proven and are already being deployed in other parts of the
world. Two main types of coal-to-liquids technologies exist. Indirect coal liquefaction
first  gasifies  the  solid  coal  and  then  converts  the  gas  into  liquid  fuels.  Direct  coal
liquefaction converts solid coal directly into a liquid ‘‘syncrude’’ that can then be fur-
ther refined into fuel products.

To  understand  how  coal-to-liquids  technologies  work,  it  is  helpful  to  focus  on  the
role  of  hydrogen  in  fuels.  Coal  typically  contains  only  five  percent  hydrogen,  while
distillable liquid fuels such as petroleum typically contain 14 percent hydrogen. The
hydrogen deficit can be made up in two different ways:

Direct Coal Liquefaction

Direct coal liquefaction involves mixing dry, pulverized coal with recycled process
oil and heating the mixture under pressure in the presence of a catalyst and hydro-
gen.  Under  these  conditions,  the  coal  transforms  into  a  liquid.  The  large  coal  mol-
ecules  (containing  hundreds  or  thousands  of  atoms)  are  broken  down  into  smaller
molecules (containing dozens of atoms). Hydrogen attaches to the broken ends of the
molecules,  resulting  in  hydrogen  content  similar  to  that  of  petroleum.  The  process
simultaneously  removes  sulfur,  nitrogen  and  ash,  resulting  in  a  synthetic  crude  oil
(syncrude)  which  can  be  refined  just  like  petroleum-derived  crude  oil  into  a  wide
range of ultra-clean finished products.

Direct  coal  liquefaction  originated  in  Germany  in  1913,  based  on  work  by
Friedrich  Bergius.  It  was  used  extensively  by  the  Germans  in  World  War  II  to
produce  high  octane  aviation  fuel.  Since  that  time,  tremendous  advancements  have
been made in product yields, purity and ease of product upgrading.

From  1976  to  2000,  the  U.S.  Government  invested  approximately  $3.6  billion
(1999 dollars) on improving and scaling up direct coal liquefaction. During this time,
pilot  and  demonstration  facilities  ranging  from  30  to  1800  barrels  per  day  of  liquid
fuel  were  built  and  operated  in  the  United  States.  The  end  result  of  this  effort  is
the  HTI  DCL  process  developed  by  Hydrocarbon  Technologies  Incorporated,  a  sub-
sidiary of Headwaters.

In June 2002, the largest coal company in China (Shenhua Group) agreed to apply
the  HTI  technology  for  the  first  phase  of  a  three-phase  multi-billion  dollar  direct
coal liquefaction project. The Shenhua direct coal liquefaction facility in Inner Mon-
golia  is  currently  under  construction  and  is  scheduled  to  startup  in  2008.  The  first
phase, as currently configured, has a capacity of 20,000 barrels per day.

Additional direct coal liquefaction projects are currently being studied or planned
in  India,  the  Philippines,  Mongolia  and  Indonesia.  The  Philippines  project  is  based
on hybrid technology utilizing both direct and indirect coal liquefaction.
Indirect Coal Liquefaction

Indirect  coal  liquefaction  is  a  two-step  process  consisting  of  coal  gasification  and
Fischer-Tropsch  (FT)  synthesis.  Coal  is  gasified  with  oxygen  and  steam  to  produce
a synthesis gas (syngas) containing hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The raw syngas
is cooled and cleaned of carbon dioxide and impurities. In the F–T synthesis reactor,
the  cleaned  syngas  comes  in  contact  with  a  catalyst  that  transforms  the  diatomic
hydrogen  and  carbon  monoxide  molecules  into  long-chained  hydrocarbons  (con-
taining  dozens  of  atoms).  The  F–T  products  can  be  refined  just  like  petroleum-de-
rived crude oil into a wide range of ultra-clean finished products.

Indirect  coal  liquefaction  was  developed  in  Germany  in  1923  based  on  work  by
Drs.  Franz  Fischer  and  Hans  Tropsch.  During  World  War  II,  the  technology  was
used by Germany to produce 17,000 barrels per day of liquid fuels from coal.

In 1955, Sasol constructed an indirect coal liquefaction plant at Sasolburg, South
Africa.  Additional  indirect  coal  liquefaction  plants  were  constructed  by  Sasol  in
Secunda,  South  Africa.  Today  Sasol  produces  the  equivalent  of  150,000  barrels  per
day  of  fuels  and  petrochemicals  using  its  technology—supplying  approximately  30
percent of South Africa’s liquid transportation fuels from coal. Technologies for indi-
rect  coal  liquefaction  are  also  being  developed  and  deployed  by  Headwaters,  Shell,
Syntroleum and Rentech.

Indirect coal liquefaction projects are currently being studied or planned in China,
Philippines, Germany, Netherlands, India, Indonesia, Australia, Mongolia, Pakistan
and  Canada.  In  the  United  States,  indirect  coal  liquefaction  projects  are  being  con-
sidered  in  Alaska,  Arizona,  Colorado,  Illinois,  Indiana,  Kentucky,  Louisiana,  Mis-
sissippi, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia and Wy-
oming,
Comparison of Direct and Indirect Coal Liquefaction Products

One  of  the  main  differences  between  direct  and  indirect  coal  liquefaction  is  the
quality  of  the  raw  liquid  products.  Direct  coal  liquefaction  raw  products  contain
more ring structure. Therefore direct coal liquefaction naphtha is an excellent feed-
stock  for  production  of  high-octane  gasoline,  while  direct  liquefaction  distillate  re-
quires  considerable  ring  opening  (mild  hydrocracking)  to  generate  on  spec  diesel
fuel. On the other hand, the straight-chain structure hydrocarbons produced by indi-
rect coal liquefaction technology results in high-cetane diesel fuel, but indirect lique-
faction naphtha needs substantial refining (isomerization and alkylation) to produce
on spec gasoline.

Both  processes  produce  low-sulfur,  low-aromatic  fuels  after  the  refining  step  Di-
rect and indirect coal liquefaction can be combined into a hybrid plant that produces
both  types  of  products  that  can  be  blended  into  premium  quality  gasoline,  jet  fuel
and diesel with minimum refining.

26

Indirect  coal  liquefaction  plants  usually  include  combined-cycle  electric  power
plants  because  they  produce  a  substantial  amount  of  steam  and  fuel  gas  that  can
be  used  to  generate  electricity.  Direct  coal  liquefaction  plants  produce  less  steam
and  fuel  gas,  so  they  can  be  designed  to  purchase  electricity,  be  self-sufficient  in
electricity generation or generate excess power depending on the local market condi-
tions.

Direct  coal  liquefaction  plants  produce  more  liquid  fuel  per  ton  of  coal  than  indi-
rect  plants.  However,  indirect  plants  are  better  suited  for  polygeneration  of  fuels,
chemicals and electricity than direct plants.

The  preferred  feedstock  for  direct  coal  liquefaction  plants  is  low-ash,  sulfur-bear-
ing, sub-bituminous or bituminous coal. Indirect plants have greater feedstock flexi-
bility and can be designed for almost any type of coal ranging from lignite to anthra-
cite.
Coal-to-Liquids Environmental Profile

Fuels produced by coal-to-liquids processes are usable in existing engines without
modifications and can be distributed through existing pipelines and distribution sys-
tems.  Nevertheless,  they  are  exceptionally  clean  when  compared  to  today’s  petro-
leum-derived transportation fuels.

Indirect  coal  liquefaction  fuels  derived  from  the  Fischer-Tropsch  process,  in  par-
ticular, contain substantially no sulfur and also exhibit lower particulate and carbon
monoxide emissions. These fuels also contribute less to the formation of nitrogen ox-
ides than petroleum derived fuels and they are readily biodegradable.

The  production  of  coal-to-liquids  fuels  is  also  environmentally  responsible.  Be-
cause  coal  liquefaction  processes  remove  contaminants  from  coal  prior  to  combus-
tion,  process  emissions  from  coal-to-liquids  plants  are  much  lower  than  traditional
pulverized coal power plants.

Both direct and indirect coal liquefaction plants generate carbon dioxide in highly
concentrated  form  allowing  carbon  capture  and  storage.  Coal-to-liquids  plants  with
carbon dioxide capture and storage can produce fuels with life cycle greenhouse gas
emission profiles that are as good as or better than that of petroleum-derived prod-
ucts.

A life cycle greenhouse gas emissions inventory for indirect coal liquefaction diesel
was  prepared  for  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  National  Energy  Laboratory
(NETL)  in  June  2001.  This  study  compared  the  emissions  for  indirect  coal  lique-
faction  (with  and  without  carbon  capture  and  storage)  diesel  with  conventional  pe-
troleum  diesel  delivered  to  Chicago,  IL.  Some  of  the  results  from  that  study  are
summarized in the following table:

27

Life cycle greenhouse gas emission inventories have not been completed on direct
and  hybrid  coal  liquefaction  technologies.  However,  based  on  the  fact  that  these
technologies have lower plant CO2 emissions than indirect coal liquefaction and the
CO2 is  in  concentrated  form,  it  can  be  assumed  that  direct  and  hybrid  technologies
will have lower life cycle GHG emissions than conventional petroleum diesel.

Gasification  technologies  like  those  that  would  be  used  in  coal-to-liquids  plants
have already demonstrated the ability to capture and store carbon dioxide on a large
scale.  For  example,  the  Dakota  Gasification  facility  in  North  Dakota  captures  CO2
from  the  gasification  process  and  transports  it  by  pipeline  to  western  Canadian  oil
fields where it is productively used for enhanced oil recovery.

There is also growing interest in utilizing coal and biomass (agricultural and for-
estry  byproducts)  together  to  further  reduce  net  carbon  dioxide  emissions.  This  is
achieved because biomass is considered a renewable resource and a zero net carbon
dioxide  emitter.  The  co-processing  of  coal  and  biomass  would  allow  a  much  greater
scale of liquid fuel production than an exclusive reliance on biofuels.

The  co-processing  of  coal  and  biomass  in  commercial  gasification  plants  is  being
done in Europe in the range of 80 to 90 percent coal and 10 to 20 percent biomass.
It  is  speculated  that  up  to  30  percent  of  the  feed  mix  could  be  in  the  form  of  bio-
mass; however there are economic and logistic issues to consider. Biomass is a bulky
material with low density, high water content and is expensive to transport and pre-
process  for  gasification.  In  addition,  it  tends  to  be  seasonal  and  widely  dispersed.
Coal-to-Liquids Economics Profile

Coal-to-liquids  projects  are  capital  intensive.  Direct  coal  liquefaction  is  slightly
less  capital  intensive  than  indirect  coal  liquefaction  ($50,000–$60,000/bpd  versus
$60,000–$80,000/bpd).  Escalating  capital  costs  related  to  raw  materials  prices  and
equipment  availability  make  small  coal-to-liquids  projects  less  economic  and  may
force  some  developers  to  look  at  larger  capacity  projects  on  the  order  of  30,000  to
80,000 barrels per day to take advantage of economies of scale.

High  capital  costs  ($2.5  billion  to  $6  billion  per  project)  and  large  project  size
(30,000  to  80,000  barrels  per  day)  will  dictate  where  and  how  viable  coal-to-liquids
projects  can  be  built.  Multiple  partners  will  likely  be  required  to  spread  the  risks
and costs. These partners may include coal suppliers, technology providers, product
users, operators, or private equity providers.

Large,  low-cost  coal  reserves  (from  500  million  tons  to  over  one  billion  tons)  will
be needed; preferably dedicated to the project. Coal-to-liquids plants can be adapted
to  handle  any  kind  of  coal  through  proper  selection  of  the  coal  gasification  tech-
nology.

The following graph indicates the impact of plant size on project economics. Large
CTL  plants  (30,000  to  80,000  barrels  per  day)  can  compete  with  petroleum-derived
products when crude oil prices exceed $35 to $45 per barrel, not including costs re-
lated  to  carbon  capture  and  storage.  In  this  case  the  debt  to  equity  ratio  was  as-
sumed to be 70:30 and did not include any government incentives on product sales.
This  graph  is  only  for  discussion  purposes.  Economic  analysis  should  be  based  on
site specific conditions for each project.

Coal-to-Liquids Commercialization Challenges

Estimates of the potential for coal-to-liquids vary widely. The Southern States En-
ergy Board that posits the possibility of coal-to-liquids production exceeding five mil-
lion  barrels  per  day.  The  National  Coal  Council  puts  forth  the  vision  of  2.6  million
barrels per day by the year 2030. The Energy Information Administration reference
case forecast projects coal-to-liquids production at about 800,000 barrels per day by
2030. This forecast assumes real oil prices increase 1.6 percent per annum over the
forecast period. If real prices rise 3.6 percent per annum, EIA projects coal-to-liquids
production to more than double to over 1.6 million barrels per day.

Although  larger  scale  coal-to-liquids  projects  appear  to  be  economically  viable  in
today’s  oil  price  environment,  there  are  still  significant  hurdles  to  get  the  first
projects  built.  There  are  no  coal-to-liquids  plants  operating  in  the  U.S.  that  would
serve as commercially proven models. Until that happens, financial institutions will
be  reluctant  to  fund  multi-billion  dollar  projects  without  significant  technology  and
market  performance  guarantees.  This  includes  some  assurance  that  plants  will  not
be  rendered  uneconomic  by  oil  producing  nations  or  cartels  that  may  seek  to  artifi-
cially reduce oil prices just long enough to prevent the formation of this competitive
new industry.

Other nations are moving forward more aggressively to deploy coal-to-liquids tech-
nologies.  In  China,  for  instance,  the  government  has  already  committed  more  than
$30  billion  to  commercialization  of  coal  gasification  and  liquefaction  technologies
and construction of the first plants has begun.

In  the  United  States,  Headwaters  is  one  of  several  companies  that  are  pursuing
development  of  coal-to-liquids  projects  using  private  sector  financing.  As  an  exam-
ple,  one  of  the  projects  we  are  pursuing  in  the  United  States  is  the  American  Lig-
nite  Energy  project  located  in  North  Dakota.  American  Lignite  Energy  features
ample coal reserves, highly qualified development partners, and substantial existing
infrastructure to support the facility. The State of North Dakota has been exception-
ally  supportive  and  has  already  committed  $10  million  of  matching  funds  for  front
end engineering and design activities. But the project’s viability is by no means cer-
tain.  The  task  of  raising  upwards  of  $2  billion  to  build  one  of  the  first  American
coal-to-liquids refineries is daunting—especially for smaller companies like ours.

Headwaters  certainly  does  not  advocate  abandoning  America’s  open  and  efficient
financial markets for a more centralized system like China’s. But the United States
should recognize that just because a technology is no longer a research project does
not mean that the free market is ready to fully embrace it.

As  long  as  oil  prices  remain  high  or  climb  higher,  market  forces  will  lead  to  the
development of a coal-to-liquids infrastructure in the United States. But that devel-
opment  will  come  slowly  and  in  measured  steps.  If  for  energy  security  reasons,  the
United States would like to speed development of a capability for making transpor-

tation  fuels  from  our  most  abundant  domestic  energy  resource,  then  incentives  for
the first coal-to-liquids project are appropriate.
Coal-to-Liquids Potential Commercialization Incentives

Incentives  for  commercializing  coal-to-liquids  technologies  in  the  United  States
should  be  constructed  to  address  the  market  risks  that  make  financing  of  the  first
several plants difficult. For example, one widely discussed approach would establish
an ‘‘oil price collar’’ to guide the government’s investment. If oil prices were to drop
below  a  specified  level,  the  United  States  would  make  payments  to  coal-to-liquids
projects  participating  in  the  program  to  ensure  their  viability.  Alternatively,  if  oil
prices rose above a higher specified level, the participating projects would pay back
into the program. Properly constructed, such a program could have a meaningful ef-
fect on addressing the market risk associated with fluctuating oil prices.

The  Coal-to-Liquids  Coalition  has  also  identified  five  specific  actions  the  Federal

Government could take to help overcome deployment barriers:

1. Provide  funding,  through  non-recourse  loans  or  grants,  for  Front  End  Engi-
neering  and  Design  (FEED)  activities.  These  activities  are  necessary  to  de-
fine projects sufficiently to seek project financing in the private sector. FEED
for a billion dollar project can cost upwards of $50 million.

2. Provide markets for the fuel produced by the first coal-to-liquids plants. Fed-
eral  agencies  like  the  Department  of  Defense  are  major  consumers  of  liquid
fuels.  By  agreeing  to  purchase  coal  derived  fuels  at  market  value,  but  not
lower than a prescribed minimum price, the government can remove the risk
of reductions in oil prices that could stop development of this industry.

3. Extend  excise  tax  credit  treatment  for  coal  derived  fuels.  The  recent
SAFETEA–LU Bill extended to coal-derived fuels the approximately 50 cents
per  gallon  excise  tax  credit  that  was  originally  created  as  an  incentive  for
ethanol  production.  But  the  provision  as  now  enacted  will  expire  before  any
coal-to-liquids facilities could be placed in service.

4. Appropriate  funds  for  loan  guarantees  authorized  in  the  Energy  Policy  Act
of  2005  and  ensure  that  those  funds  are  made  available  to  coal-to-liquids
projects.

5. Ensure  that  industrial  gasification  tax  credits  authorized  in  the  Energy  Pol-

icy Act of 2005 are also extended to coal-to-liquids projects.

Combined with support from states and local communities anxious to see develop-
ment of coal resources, these actions would help private industry bridge the deploy-
ment gap and establish a coal-to-liquids capability more quickly for our nation.
Areas Needing Additional Research and Development

Research  support  is  needed  to  continue  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  environ-
mental  performance  of  coal-to-liquids  technologies  with  the  goal  of  making  this  re-
source even cleaner.

Headwaters  has  for  a  period  of  over  25  years  collaborated  with  DOE’s  National
Energy  Technology  Laboratory  (NETL)  on  a  number  of  research  and  development
activities related to the direct and indirect conversion of coal to transportation fuels
and chemicals.

Most recently, we have benefited from a number of economic and technical reports
and  analyses  on  coal  conversion  processes  that  have  been  both  created  and  made
public by NETL. Particularly pertinent to today’s discussion is a recently completed
study  for  the  Air  Force,  showing  how  coal  biomass  to  liquids  (CBTL)  processes  can
be  economically  and  environmentally  competitive,  not  only  in  today’s  marketplace,
but  also  in  the  future  when  the  control  of  greenhouse  gases  becomes  a  national
mandate.

Specific areas where continued research and development support would be bene-

ficial include:

• Utilization  of  biomass  as  a  strategy  for  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions.
• Improving  life  cycle  assessment  tools  for  determining  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions  profiles  for  coal-to-liquids  facilities  when  compared  to  other  fossil  fuel
energy sources.
• Expanding methods of carbon capture and storage beyond currently available

opportunities in the area of enhanced oil recovery.

Coal-to-Liquids Advantages

The advantages to developing a coal-to-liquids capability in the United States are
numerous.  Some  of  the  dollars  we  now  send  overseas  to  buy  oil  would  be  kept  at

home  to  develop  American  jobs  utilizing  American  energy  resources.  We  would  ex-
pand  and  diversify  our  liquid  fuels  production  and  refining  capacity  using  tech-
nologies that are already proven. We would produce clean-burning fuels that can be
distributed  through  our  existing  pipelines  and  service  stations  to  fuel  our  existing
vehicles with no modifications to their engines. We would take a real and immediate
step toward greater energy security.

Thank  you  for  the  invitation  to  testify  and  for  your  interest  in  this  important

topic. I would be happy to answer any questions.

Chairman LAMPSON. Dr. Bartis.

STATEMENT OF DR. JAMES T. BARTIS, SENIOR POLICY

RESEARCHER, RAND CORPORATION

Dr. BARTIS. Thank you for inviting me to testify.
The  United  States  oil  consumers  are  currently  paying  about  a
half trillion dollars per year for crude oil, and most of that amount
ends  up  being  paid  for  by  households,  either  directly  or  in  higher
prices for products and services. The bill averages to almost $5,000
per  household  per  year.  More  over,  the  large  amount  of  wealth
transferred—on a global basis—from oil consumers to oil producers
raises  serious  national  security  concerns  because  some,  although
certainly not all, of this revenue is being spent contrary to our for-
eign policy interests.

But  no  less  pressing  is  the  importance  of  addressing  the  threat
of global climate change. For example, without measures to address
carbon dioxide emissions, the use of coal-derived liquids to displace
petroleum  fuels  for  transportation  will  more  than  double  green-
house gas emissions. And this is clearly not acceptable.

The  emphasis  of  our  research  at  RAND  on  unconventional  fuels
has concentrated on what is known as the Fischer-Tropsch coal-to-
liquids  method.  We  find  this  option  to  be  the  only  unconventional
fuel option that is commercially ready today and capable of eventu-
ally  displacing  millions  of  barrels  per  day  of  imported  petroleum.
Producing  large  amounts  of  unconventional  fuels,  including  coal-
derived  liquid  fuels,  and  moving  towards  greater  energy  efficiency
will  cause  world  oil  prices  to  decrease.  Our  research  shows  that
under  reasonable  assumptions  this  price  reduction  effort  could  be
very  large  and  would  likely  result  in  large  benefits  to  U.S.  con-
sumers and large decreases in OPEC’s revenues.

We  have  also  examined  whether  a  large  domestic  coal-to-liquids
industry can be developed consistent with the need to manage car-
bon dioxide emissions.

If  we  are  willing  to  accept  emission  levels  that  are  similar  to
those  associated  with  conventional  petroleum,  the  answer  is  defi-
nitely  yes.  One  technical  approach  for  achieving  parity  with  petro-
leum  is  the  capture  and  sequestration  of  the  carbon  dioxide  gen-
erated at the plant site.

A  second  approach  involves  using  a  combination  of  coal  and  bio-
mass  as  we  just  heard.  Fortunately,  the  second  approach  is  very
low risk, although not quite ready for commercial production.

Now, given the large demand on OPEC oil that we anticipate will
persist  over  the  next  50  years,  this  is  a  very  good  answer.  We  can
at  least  address  a  major  economic  and  national  security  problem
while  not  worsening  environmental  impacts,  at  least  on  the  global
scale.

If,  however,  we  demand  a  significant  reduction  in  the  emission
levels  as  compared  to  conventional  petroleum,  the  answer  is  a
qualified  yes.  The  only  way  we  know  of  reaching  this  level  of  car-
bon dioxide control when making coal-derived fuels is to use a com-
bination  of  coal  and  biomass  as  the  feed  for  the  plant  and  to  cap-
ture  and  sequester  most  of  the  carbon  dioxide  generated  at  the
plant  site.  The  reason  I  give  a  qualified  yes  is  that  there  does  re-
main  considerable  uncertainty  regarding  the  viability  of  seques-
tering carbon dioxide in geological formations.

Against this background of benefits and challenges, federal R&D
has  an  important  role  to  play.  Foremost  in  priority  are  multiple
large-scale  demonstrations  of  carbon  sequestration.  Our  analysis
shows  that  the  limiting  factor  in  the  growth  of  a  domestic  coal-to-
liquids  industry  will  be  the  time  required  to  determine  whether
and  how  hundreds  of  millions  of  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  can  be  an-
nually sequestered.

The  remainder  of  my  recommendations  follow  from  what  we  at
RAND  describe  as  the  middle  path  to  coal-to-liquids  development,
namely  a  path  that  focuses  on  reducing  uncertainties,  fostering
early, but very limited, commercial experience; and reducing green-
house gas emissions.

First, Congress should consider providing federal cost sharing for
a  few  site-specific  front-end  engineering  designs  of  commercial
plants  to  convert  coal-to-liquid  fuels  so  that  government  and  pri-
vate  investors  have  better  information  on  production  costs.  At
RAND  we  have  learned  that  when  it  comes  to  cost  estimates  it  is
often the case that the less you know the more attractive the costs.
Second, Congress should consider establishing a flexible incentive
program  capable  of  promoting  the  construction  and  operation  of  a
few  early  coal-to-liquid  plants  by  our  country’s  top  technology
firms. The early plants could also serve as demonstration platforms
for  carbon  capture  and  sequestration  and  the  combined  use  of  bio-
mass and coal.

Third,  the  current  energy  R&D  program  on  transportation  fuels
in  the  Department  of  Energy  is  too  narrowly  focused  on  hydrogen
and  ethanol  from  cellulosic  materials.  This  program  needs  to  ex-
pand  to  provide  adequate  support  to  gasification  of  biomass  or  a
combination of coal and biomass.

The most pressing near-term research need centers on developing
a  fuel  handling  and  gasification  system  capable  of  accepting  both
biomass and coal.

Finally,  I  recommend  consideration  of  a  number  of  important
high-risk, high-payoff research opportunities that are not being ad-
dressed  in  the  current  federal  program  because  they  require  a
longer timeframe for execution, and these opportunities are covered
in my written testimony.

This concludes my remarks. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JAMES T. BARTIS1

Research and Development Issues for Producing Liquid

Fuels From Coal

Mr.  Chairman  and  distinguished  Members:  Thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  speak
on  technical  issues  associated  with  the  potential  use  of  our  nation’s  coal  resources
to  produce  liquid  fuels.  I  am  a  senior  policy  researcher  at  the  RAND  Corporation
with more than 25 years of experience in analyzing and assessing energy technology
and  policy  issues.  At  RAND,  I  am  actively  involved  in  research  directed  at  under-
standing the costs and benefits associated with alternative approaches for promoting
the use of coal and other domestically abundant resources, such as oil shale and bio-
mass,  to  lessen  our  nation’s  dependence  on  imported  petroleum.  Various  aspects  of
this work are sponsored and funded by the National Energy Technology Laboratory
(NETL) of the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Air Force, the Federal Aviation
Administration, and the National Commission on Energy Policy.

Today,  I  will  discuss  the  key  problems  and  policy  issues  associated  with  devel-
oping  a  domestic  coal-to-liquids  industry  and  the  approaches  Congress  can  take  to
address  these  issues.  My  main  conclusions  are  as  follows.  First,  successfully  devel-
oping  a  coal-to-liquids  industry  in  the  United  States  would  bring  significant  eco-
nomic  and  national  security  benefits  by  reducing  energy  costs  and  wealth  transfers
to  oil-exporting  nations.  Second,  the  production  of  petroleum  substitutes  from  coal
may  cause  a  significant  increase  in  carbon  dioxide  emissions;  however,  relatively
low-risk  research  opportunities  exist  that,  if  successful,  could  lower  carbon  dioxide
emissions  to  levels  well  below  those  associated  with  producing  and  using  conven-
tional  petroleum.  Third,  without  federal  assistance,  sufficient  private-sector  invest-
ment  in  coal-to-liquids  production  plants  is  unlikely  to  occur  because  of  uncertain-
ties  about  the  future  of  world  oil  prices,  the  costs  and  performance  of  initial  com-
mercial  plants,  and  the  viability  of  carbon  management  options.  Finally,  a  federal
program directed at reducing these uncertainties; obtaining early, but limited, com-
mercial  experience;  and  supporting  research  appears  to  offer  the  greatest  strategic
benefits,  given  both  economic  and  national  security  benefits  and  the  uncertainties
associated with economic viability and environmental performance, most notably the
control of greenhouse gas emissions.

Some  of  the  topics  I  will  be  discussing  today  are  supported  by  research  that
RAND  has  only  recently  completed;  consequently,  the  results  have  not  yet  under-
gone  the  thorough  internal  and  peer  reviews  that  typify  RAND  research  reports.
Out  of  respect  for  this  committee  and  the  sponsors  of  this  research,  and  in  compli-
ance  with  RAND’s  core  values,  I  will  present  only  findings  in  which  RAND  and  I
have full confidence at this time.
Technical Readiness and Production Potential

As  part  of  RAND’s  examination  of  coal-to-liquids  fuels  development,  we  have  re-
viewed  the  technical,  economic,  and  environmental  viability  and  production  poten-
tial  of  a  range  of  options  for  producing  liquid  fuels  from  domestic  resources.  If  we
focus  on  unconventional  fuel  technologies  that  are  now  ready  for  large-scale,  com-
mercial  production  and  that  can  displace  at  least  a  million  barrels  per  day  of  im-
ported  oil,  we  find  only  two  candidates:  grain-derived  ethanol  and  Fischer-Tropsch
(F–T)  coal-to-liquids.  Moreover,  only  the  F–T  coal-to-liquids  candidate  produces  a
fuel  that  is  suitable  for  use  in  heavy-duty  trucks,  railroad  engines,  commercial  air-
craft, or military vehicles and weapon systems.

If  we  expand  our  time  horizon  to  consider  technologies  that  might  be  ready  for
use  in  initial  commercial  plants  within  the  next  five  years,  only  one  or  two  new
technologies become available: the in-situ oil shale approaches being pursued by sev-
eral  firms  and  the  F–T  approaches  for  converting  biomass  or  a  combination  of  coal
and biomass to liquid fuels. We have also looked carefully at the development pros-
pects  for  technologies  that  are  intended  to  produce  alcohol  fuels  from  sources  other
than  food  crops,  generally  referred  to  as  cellulosic  materials.  Our  finding  is  that,
while  this  is  an  important  area  for  research  and  development,  the  technology  base

is  not  yet  sufficiently  developed  to  support  an  assessment  that  alcohol  production
from cellulosic materials will be competitive with F–T biomass-to-liquid fuels within
the next 10 years, if ever.
The Strategic Benefits of Coal-to-Liquids Production

Our research is also addressing the strategic benefits of having in place a mature
coal-to-liquid fuels industry producing several million barrels of oil per day. If coal-
derived liquids were added to the world oil market, such additional liquid fuel sup-
plies would cause world oil prices to be lower than they would be if these additional
supplies  were  not  produced.  This  effect  occurs  regardless  of  what  fuel  is  being  con-
sidered. It holds for coal-derived liquids and for oil shale, heavy oils, tar sands, and
biomass-derived  liquids,  as  well  as,  for  that  matter,  additional  supplies  of  conven-
tional petroleum. The price-reduction effect also occurs when oil demand is reduced
through  fiscal  measures,  such  as  taxes  on  oil,  or  through  the  introduction  of  ad-
vanced  technologies  that  use  less  petroleum,  such  as  higher  efficiency  vehicles.
Moreover, this reduction in world oil prices is independent of where such additional
production  or  energy  conservation  occurs,  as  long  as  the  additional  production  is
outside of OPEC and OPEC-cooperating nations.

In  a  2005  analysis  of  the  strategic  benefits  of  oil  shale  development,  RAND  esti-
mated  that  three  million  barrels  per  day  of  additional  liquid-fuel  production  would
yield a world oil price drop of between three and five percent.2 Our ongoing research
supports that estimated range and shows that the price drop increases in proportion
to  production  increases.  For  instance,  an  increase  of  six  million  barrels  per  day
would  likely  yield  a  world  oil  price  drop  of  between  six  and  10  percent.  This  more
recent research also shows that even larger price reductions may occur in situations
in  which  oil  markets  are  particularly  tight  or  in  which  OPEC  is  unable  to  enforce
a profit-optimizing response among its members.

This  anticipated  reduction  in  world  oil  prices  yields  important  economic  benefits.
In  particular,  U.S.  consumers  would  pay  tens  of  billions  of  dollars  less  for  oil  or,
under  some  future  situations,  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars  less  for  oil  per  year.
On a per-household basis, we estimate that the average annual benefit could range
from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars.

Further, this anticipated reduction in world oil prices also yields a major national
security benefit. At present, OPEC revenues from oil exports are about $700 billion
per year. Projections of future petroleum supply and demand published by the U.S.
Department of Energy indicate that, unless measures are taken to reduce the prices
of,  and  demand  for,  OPEC  petroleum,  such  revenues  will  grow  considerably.  These
high revenues raise serious national security concerns, because some OPEC member
nations are governed by regimes that are not supportive of U.S. foreign policy objec-
tives.  Income  from  petroleum  exports  has  been  used  by  unfriendly  nations,  such  as
Iran  and  Iraq  under  Saddam  Hussein,  to  support  weapon  purchases  or  to  develop
their  own  industrial  base  for  munitions  manufacture.  Also,  the  higher  prices  rise,
the greater the chances that oil-importing countries will pursue special relationships
with oil exporters and defer joining the United States in multilateral diplomatic ef-
forts.

Our  research  shows  that  developing  an  unconventional  fuels  industry  that  dis-
places  millions  of  barrels  of  petroleum  per  day  will  cause  a  significant  decrease  in
OPEC revenues from oil exports. This decrease results from a combination of lower
prices and a lower demand for OPEC production. The size of this reduction in OPEC
revenues  is  determined  by  the  volume  of  unconventional  fuels  produced  and  future
market  conditions,  but  our  ongoing  research  indicates  that  expectations  of  annual
reductions  of  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars  are  not  unreasonable.  The  significant
reduction in wealth transfers to OPEC and the geopolitical consequences of reduced
demand for OPEC oil represent the major national security benefits associated with
the  development  of  an  unconventional  liquid  fuels  production  industry.  Note  that
these revenue reductions would affect all petroleum exporters, both friends and foes.
These  strategic  benefits  derive  from  the  existence  of  the  OPEC  cartel.  The  favor-
able  benefits  of  reduced  oil  prices  accrue  to  consumers  and  the  Nation  as  a  whole;
however,  the  private  firms  that  would  invest  in  coal-to-liquids  development  do  not
capture those benefits.
The Direct Benefits of Coal-to-Liquids Production

Beyond the strategic benefits for the Nation associated with coal-to-liquids produc-
tion are certain direct benefits. If coal-derived liquid fuels can be produced at prices

fuels  development  could  garner  economic  profits  above  and  beyond  what  is  consid-
ered  a  normal  return  on  their  investments.  Through  taxes  on  these  profits  and,  in
some  cases,  lease  and  royalty  payments,  we  estimate  that  roughly  35  percent  of
these economic profits could go to Federal, State, and local governments and, there-
by, broadly benefit the public.

An auxiliary benefit of coal-to-liquids development derives from the broad regional
dispersion of the U.S. coal resource base and the fact that coal-to-liquids plants are
able  to  produce  finished  motor  fuels  that  are  ready  for  retail  distribution.  As  such,
developing a coal-to-liquids industry should increase the resiliency of the overall pe-
troleum supply chain.

The  remaining  benefits  of  developing  a  coal-to-liquids  production  industry  are
local  or  regional,  as  opposed  to  national.  In  particular,  coal-to-liquids  industrial  de-
velopment  offers  significant  opportunities  for  economic  development  and  would  in-
crease employment in coal-rich states.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions

While the strategic benefits of the development of a domestic coal-to-liquids indus-
try  are  compelling,  no  less  pressing  is  the  importance  of  addressing  the  threat  of
global  climate  change.  Specifically,  without  measures  to  address  carbon  dioxide
emissions,  the  use  of  coal-derived  liquids  to  displace  petroleum  fuels  for  transpor-
tation will roughly double greenhouse gas emissions.

This finding is relevant to the total fuel life cycle, i.e., well-to-wheels or coal mine-
to-wheels. This increase in greenhouse gas emissions is primarily attributable to the
large amount of carbon dioxide emissions that come from an F–T coal-to-liquids pro-
duction  plant  relative  to  a  conventional  oil  refinery.  In  fact,  looking  solely  at  the
combustion of F–T-derived fuel as opposed to its production, our analyses show that
combustion of an F–T, coal-derived fuel would produce somewhat, although not sig-
nificantly, lower greenhouse gas emissions than would the combustion of a gasoline
or diesel motor fuel prepared by refining petroleum.

In  our  judgment,  the  high  greenhouse  gas  emissions  of  F–T  coal-to-liquids  plants
that do not manage such emissions preclude their widespread use as a means of dis-
placing imported petroleum. We now turn to some options for managing greenhouse
gas emissions.
Options for Managing Greenhouse Gas Emissions

For  managing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  for  F–T  coal-to-liquids  plants,  we  have
examined  three  options:  (1)  carbon  capture  and  sequestration,  (2)  carbon  dioxide
capture  and  use  in  enhanced  oil  recovery,  and  (3)  gasification  of  both  coal  and  bio-
mass followed by F–T synthesis of liquid fuels. We discuss each below in turn.
Carbon  Capture  and  Sequestration:  By  carbon  capture  and  sequestration,  I
refer  to  technical  approaches  being  developed  in  the  United  States,  primarily
through funding from the U.S. Department of Energy, and abroad that are designed
to capture carbon dioxide produced in coal-fired power plants and to sequester that
carbon  dioxide  in  various  types  of  geological  formations,  such  as  deep  saline
aquifers.  This  same  approach  can  be  used  to  capture  and  sequester  carbon  dioxide
emissions from F–T coal-to-liquids plants and from F–T plants operating on biomass
or  a  combination  of  coal  and  biomass.  When  applied  to  F–T  coal-to-liquids  plants,
carbon capture and sequestration should cause mine-to-wheels greenhouse gas emis-
sions  to  drop  to  levels  comparable  to  the  well-to-wheels  emissions  associated  with
conventional,  petroleum-derived  motor  fuels.  Most  importantly,  our  research  indi-
cates  that  any  incentive  adequate  to  promote  carbon  capture  at  coal-fired  power
plants should be even more effective in promoting carbon capture at F–T plants pro-
ducing liquid fuels.

The U.S. Department of Energy program on carbon capture and sequestration has
made considerable technical progress. However, considering the continued and grow-
ing  importance  of  coal  for  both  power  and  liquids  production  and  the  potential  ad-
verse  impacts  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  we  believe  that  current  funding  levels
are not adequate. While we are optimistic that carbon capture and geologic seques-
tration  can  be  successfully  developed  as  a  viable  approach  for  carbon  management,
we  also  recognize  that  successful  development  constitutes  a  major  technical  chal-
lenge  and  that  the  road  to  success  requires  multiple,  large-scale  demonstrations
that  go  well  beyond  the  current  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  plans  and  budget  for
the efforts that are now under way.
Carbon  Capture  and  Enhanced  Oil  Recovery:  In  coal-to-liquids  plants,  about
0.8  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  are  produced  along  with  each  barrel  of  liquid  fuel.  For
coal-to-liquids plants located near currently producing oil fields, this carbon dioxide
can  be  used  to  drive  additional  oil  recovery.  We  anticipate  that  each  ton  of  carbon

dioxide applied to enhanced oil recovery will cause the additional production of two
to three barrels of oil, although this ratio depends highly on reservoir properties and
oil prices. Based on recent studies sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, op-
portunities  for  enhanced  oil  recovery  provide  carbon  management  options  for  at
least  half  a  million  barrels  per  year  of  coal-to-liquids  production  capacity.  A  favor-
able  collateral  consequence  of  this  approach  to  carbon  management  is  that  half  a
million barrels per day of coal-to-liquids production will promote additional domestic
petroleum production of roughly one million barrels per day.

The  use  of  pressurized  carbon  dioxide  for  enhanced  oil  recovery  is  a  well-estab-
lished  practice  in  the  petroleum  industry.  Technology  for  capturing  carbon  dioxide
at  a  coal-to-liquids  plant  is  also  well  established,  although  further  R&D  may  yield
cost  reductions.  There  are  no  technical  risks,  but  questions  do  remain  about  meth-
ods  to  optimize  the  fraction  of  carbon  dioxide  that  would  be  permanently  seques-
tered.
Combined  Gasification  of  Coal  and  Biomass:  Non-food-crop  biomass  resources
suitable  as  feedstocks  for  F–T  biomass-to-liquid  production  plants  include  mixed
prairie  grasses,  switchgrass,  corn  stover  and  other  crop  residues,  forest  residues,
and crops that might be grown on dedicated energy plantations. When such biomass
resources  are  used  to  produce  liquids  through  the  F–T  method,  our  research  shows
that  greenhouse  gas  emissions  should  be  well  below  those  associated  with  the  use
of conventional petroleum fuels. Moreover, when a combination of coal and biomass
is  used,  for  example,  a  40–60  mix,  we  estimate  that  net  carbon  dioxide  emissions
will  be  comparable  to  or,  likelier,  lower  than  well-to-wheels  emissions  of  conven-
tional, petroleum-derived motor fuels. Finally, we have examined liquid fuel produc-
tion concepts in which carbon capture and sequestration is combined with the com-
bined  gasification  of  coal  and  biomass.  Our  preliminary  estimate  is  that  a  50–50
coal-biomass mix combined with carbon capture and sequestration should yield neg-
ative carbon dioxide emissions. Negative emissions imply that the net result of pro-
ducing  and  using  the  fuel  would  be  the  removal  of  carbon  dioxide  from  the  atmos-
phere.

One perspective on the combined gasification of coal and biomass is that biomass
enables F–T coal-to-liquids production, in that the combined feedstock approach pro-
vides  an  immediate  pathway  to  unconventional  liquids  with  no  net  increase  in
greenhouse gas emissions, and an ultimate vision, with carbon capture and seques-
tration, of zero net emissions. Another perspective is that coal enables F–T biomass-
to-liquids  production,  in  that  the  combined  approach  reduces  overall  production
costs  by  reducing  fuel  delivery  costs,  allowing  larger  plants  that  take  advantage  of
economies of scale, and smoothing over the inevitable fluctuations in biomass avail-
ability  associated  with  annual  and  multi-year  fluctuations  in  weather  patterns,  es-
pecially rainfall.
Prospects for a Commercial Coal-to-Liquids Industry

The  prospects  for  a  commercial  coal-to-liquids  industry  in  the  United  States  re-

main unclear. Three major impediments block the way forward:

1. Uncertainty about the costs and performance of coal-to-liquids plants;
2. Uncertainty about the future course of world oil prices; and
3. Uncertainty  about  whether  and  how  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  especially

carbon dioxide emissions, might be controlled in the United States.

As part of our ongoing work, RAND researchers have met with firms that are pro-
moting  coal-to-liquids  development  or  that  clearly  have  the  management,  financial,
and technical capabilities to play a leading role in developing of a commercial indus-
try. Our findings are that these three uncertainties are impeding and will continue
to  impede  private-sector  investment  in  a  coal-to-liquids  industry  unless  the  govern-
ment  provides  fairly  significant  financial  incentives,  especially  incentives  that  miti-
gate the risks of a fall in world oil prices.

But just as these three uncertainties are impeding private-sector investment, they
should  also  deter  an  immediate  national  commitment  to  establish  rapidly  a  multi-
million-barrel-per-day coal-to-liquids industry. However, the traditional hands-off or
‘‘research-only’’  approach  is  not  commensurate  with  continuing  adverse  economic,
national security, and global environmental consequences of relying on imported pe-
troleum.  For  this  reason,  Congress  should  consider  a  middle  path  to  developing  a
coal-to-liquids  industry  that  focuses  on  reducing  uncertainties  and  fostering  early
operating experience by promoting the construction and operation of a limited num-
ber  of  commercial-scale  plants.  We  consider  this  approach  an  ‘‘insurance  strategy,’’
in  that  it  is  an  affordable  approach  that  significantly  improves  the  national  capa-
bility to build a domestic unconventional-fuels industry as government and industry

learn  more  about  the  future  course  of  world  oil  prices  and  as  the  policy  and  tech-
nical mechanisms for carbon management become clearer.

Designing, building, and gaining early operating experience from a few coal-to-liq-
uids plants would reduce the cost and performance uncertainties that currently im-
pede  private-sector  investments.  At  present,  the  knowledge  base  for  coal-to-liquids
plant construction costs and environmental performance is very limited. Our current
best estimate is that coal-to-liquids production from large, first-of-a-kind commercial
plants  is  competitive  when  crude  oil  prices  average  in  the  range  of  $50  to  $60  per
barrel.  However,  this  estimate  is  based  on  highly  conceptual  engineering  design
analyses  that  are  intended  only  to  provide  rough  estimates  of  costs.  At  RAND,  we
have learned that, when it comes to cost estimates, typically the less you know, the
more attractive the costs. Details are important, and they are not yet available. For
this reason, we believe that it is essential that the Department of Energy and Con-
gress  have  access  to  the  more  reliable  costing  that  is  generally  associated  with  the
completion  of  a  more  comprehensive  design  effort,  generally  known  as  a  ‘‘front-end
engineering design.’’

Early operating experience would promote post-production learning, leading to fu-
ture  plants  with  lower  costs  and  improved  performance.  Post-production  cost  im-
provement—sometimes  called  the  learning  curve—plays  a  crucial  role  in  the  chem-
ical  process  industry,  and  we  anticipate  that  this  effect  will  eventually  result  in  a
major reduction of the costs of coal-derived liquid fuels. Most important, by reducing
cost  and  performance  uncertainties  and  production  costs,  a  small  number  of  early
plants  could  form  the  basis  for  a  rapid  expansion  by  the  private  sector  of  a  more
economically competitive coal-to-liquids industry, depending on future developments
in world oil markets.
Options for Federal Action

The  Federal  Government  could  take  several  productive  measures  to  address  the
three major uncertainties we have noted—production risks, market risks, and global
warming—so that industry can move forward with a limited commercial production
program consistent with an insurance strategy. A key step, as noted, is reducing un-
certainties  about  plant  costs  and  performance  by  encouraging  the  design,  construc-
tion,  and  operation  of  a  few  coal-to-liquids  plants.  An  engineering  design  adequate
to obtain a confident estimate of costs, to establish environmental performance, and
to  support  federal,  State,  and  local  permitting  requirements  will  cost  roughly  $30
million.  The  Federal  Government  should  consider  cost-sharing  options  that  would
promote  the  development  of  a  few  site-specific  designs.  The  information  from  such
efforts would also provide Congress with a much stronger basis for designing broad-
er measures to promote unconventional-fuel development.

We  have  analyzed  alternative  incentive  packages  for  promoting  early  commercial
operating experience. In this analysis of incentives, we have examined not only the
extent  to  which  the  incentive  motivates  private-sector  investment  but  also  the  po-
tential  impact  on  federal  expenditures  over  a  broad  range  of  potential  future  out-
comes.  At  this  time,  we  are  able  to  report  that  more  attractive  incentive  packages
generally  involve  a  combination  of  the  following  three  mechanisms:  (1)  a  reduction
in  front-end  investment  costs,  such  as  what  would  be  offered  by  an  investment  tax
credit; (2) a reduction in downside risks by a floor price guarantee; and (3) a sharing
of  upside  benefits  such  as  what  would  be  offered  by  a  profit-sharing  agreement  be-
tween the government and producers when oil prices are high enough to justify such
sharing.

We  also  find  that  federal  loan  guarantees  can  have  powerful  effects,  mainly  be-
cause they allow the share of debt supporting the project to increase, since the gov-
ernment  is  assuming  the  risk  of  project  default.  For  this  very  reason,  we  caution
against  the  use  of  federal  loan  guarantees  unless  Congress  is  confident  that  the
Federal  Government  is  able  to  put  in  place  a  technical  and  financial  project  moni-
toring and control system capable of protecting the federal purse.
R&D Opportunities

A  great  benefit  of  the  F–T  approach  to  liquid  fuel  development  is  that  we  know
it  works.  F–T  fuels  are  being  produced  today  using  both  coal  and  natural  gas  in
South  Africa  and  using  natural  gas  in  Malaysia  and  Qatar.  F–T  fuels  or  blends  of
F–T  and  conventional  petroleum  products  are  in  commercial  use.  Their  suitability
for  use  in  vehicles  and  commercial  aviation  has  been  established.  The  R&D  chal-
lenge  for  coal-to-liquids  development  is  not  how  to  use  but  rather  how  to  produce
these  fuels  in  a  manner  that  is  consistent  with  our  national  environmental  objec-
tives.

If  the  Federal  Government  is  prepared  to  promote  early  production  experience,
then  expanded  federal  R&D  efforts  are  needed.  Most  important,  consideration

should  be  given  to  accelerating  the  development  and  testing  (including  large-scale
testing) of methods for the long-term sequestration of carbon dioxide. This could in-
volve  using  one  or  more  of  the  early  coal-to-liquids  production  plants  as  a  source
of carbon dioxide for the testing of sequestration options.

At  present,  the  Federal  Government  is  supporting  research  on  coal  gasification
and associated synthesis gas cleaning and treatment processes. All of this federally
funded  research  is  directed  at  nearer-term,  lower-risk  concepts  for  advanced  power
generation and the production of hydrogen, but much of it is also directly applicable
to F–T coal-to-liquids production.

Missing from the federal R&D portfolio are near-term efforts to establish the com-
mercial viability of a few techniques for the combined use of coal and biomass. Such
a  combination  offers  significant  cost  and  environmental  payoffs.  The  most  pressing
near-term research need centers on developing an integrated gasification system ca-
pable  of  handling  both  biomass  and  coal.  The  problem  is  to  devise  a  system  that
grinds, pressurizes, and feeds a stream of biomass or a combination of biomass and
coal  into  the  gasifier  with  high  reliability  and  efficiency  and  without  damaging  the
gasifier.  This  is  a  fairly  minor  technical  challenge.  It  is  an  engineering  problem  fo-
cusing on performance and reliability, not a science problem. To establish the design
basis  for  such  a  system  requires  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  one  or
a few test rigs. These test rigs need to be fairly large so that they are handling flows
close  to  what  would  be  the  case  in  a  commercial  plant.  This  is  because  solids  are
involved, and it is very difficult to predict performance and reliability of solids-han-
dling  and  processing  systems  when  the  size  or  throughput  of  the  system  undergoes
a large increase. Such large-scale testing could also be conducted during the design
and  construction  of  a  full-scale  plant  for  coal-to-liquids  production,  with  the  under-
standing that, if this were successfully demonstrated, the plant would convert to ac-
cept a mixture of coal and biomass.

In my judgment, the current federal portfolio on gasification systems does not give
adequate  support  to  mid-  and  long-term  R&D  directed  at  high-risk,  high-payoff  op-
portunities  for  cost  reduction  and  improved  efficiency  and  environmental  perform-
ance.  Especially  fruitful  areas  for  R&D  are  oxygen  production  at  reduced  energy
consumption, improved gas-gas separation technology, higher-temperature gas-puri-
fication  systems,  and  reduced  or  eliminated  oxygen  demand  during  gasification.  I
also suggest research directed at advanced F–T process concepts that allow efficient
liquid-fuels  production  at  small  scales,  i.e.,  at  a  few  thousand  barrels  per  day,  not
tens  of  thousands.  Very  large  F–T  coal-to-liquids  plants  may  be  suitable  for  Wyo-
ming  and  Montana,  but  east  of  the  Mississippi,  much  smaller  plants  may  be  more
appropriate.

In promoting the production of alcohol fuels from cellulosic feedstocks, the Federal
Government  is  making  major  R&D  investments.  In  our  judgment,  the  appropriate
approach to balance this fuels-production portfolio is not to lower the investment in
cellulosic conversion, but rather to significantly increase the investment in F–T ap-
proaches, including coal, biomass, and combined coal and biomass gasification.

The long- and mid-term research efforts that I have described would significantly
enhance  the  learning  and  cost-reduction  potential  associated  with  early  production
experience.  As  a  collateral  benefit  of  this  public  investment,  such  longer-term  re-
search efforts would also support the training of specialized scientific and engineer-
ing talent required for long-term progress.

In  closing,  I  commend  the  Committee  for  addressing  the  important  and  inter-
twined  topics  of  reducing  demand  for  crude  oil  and  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions.  The  United  States  has  before  it  many  opportunities—including  coal  and  oil
shale,  renewable  sources,  improved  energy  efficiency,  and  fiscal  and  regulatory  ac-
tions—that  can  promote  greater  energy  security.  Coal-to-liquids  and,  more  gen-
erally, F–T gasification processes can be important parts of the portfolio as the Na-
tion  responds  to  the  realities  of  world  energy  markets,  the  presence  of  growing  en-
ergy demand, and the need to protect the environment.

STATEMENT OF DR. DAVID G. HAWKINS, DIRECTOR, CLIMATE

CENTER, NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL

Dr.  HAWKINS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Sub-

committee. Thank you for inviting me to testify today.

As  has  already  been  noted  by  several  Members  and  by  the  wit-
nesses, we are facing as a nation, indeed as a planet, two large and
growing  threats;  oil  dependence  and  global  warming.  It  is  critical
that  we  address  these  together  in  designing  strategies  for  energy
and environmental protection.

Now,  the  supporters  of  coal-to-liquids  technology  claim  that  the
fuel  can  both  reduce  oil  dependence  and  can  have  greenhouse  gas
emissions  that  are  as  good  or  better  than  the  petroleum  products
that  they  replace.  Well,  those  are  claims,  and  this  is  the  Science
and  Technology  Committee,  and  good  science  requires  that  the
claims be analyzed.

The problem is that these claims have not had the scrutiny that
is  required  given  the  attention  that  Congress  has  been  paying  to
this  matter.  Certainly,  the  objective  analysis  of  the  total  life  cycle
impacts of this approach of coal-to-liquids to addressing these twin
problems  compared  to  other  alternatives  have  not  been  presented
to  Congress,  and  they  are  certainly  no  basis  for  the  mandates  and
incentives  that  have  been  fuel-specific  that  have  been  voted  on  in
both  bodies  of  Congress,  fortunately  neither  has  been  enacted  for-
tunately in our view.

Because  to  do  so  would  be  making  a  mistake,  given  the  lack  of
analysis  that  has  been  provided  about  the  merits  of  this  approach
compared  to  others.  So  let  us  take  a  look  at  a  number  of  these
issues in the time that I have.

First,  as  to  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  the  most  authoritative
analysis  by  the  Argonne  National  Labs  indicates  that  without  car-
bon  capture,  coal-to-liquids  will  produce  more  than  twice  the  well-
to-wheels greenhouse gas emissions of diesel fuel, and even with 85
percent capture of carbon from a coal-to-liquids plant, the resulting
emissions  will  still  be  about  20  percent  greater  than  conventional
diesel fuel.

Now,  let  us  compare  this  to  alternative  ways  of  using  coal  to
back  out  oil,  because  there  are  alternative  ways.  One  of  them  is
with  plug-in  hybrid  vehicles.  We  can  have  coal,  turn  it  into  elec-
tricity.  If  we  do  that  in  a  modern  plant  that  is  equipped  with  car-
bon capture and storage, we can back out about twice as many bar-
rels  of  oil  per  ton  of  coal  as  compared  to  the  coal-to-liquids  tech-

nology,  and  we  can  do  it  with  one-tenth  the  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions. These are facts that haven’t been presented to the Congress,
and  it  ought  to  be  evaluated  before  we  move  forward  with  what  is
likely to be a sub-optimal approach.

The  problems  that  I  want  to  turn  to  next  are  problems  of  scale.
In  order  to  make  a  difference  on  oil  security,  a  coal-to-liquids  in-
dustry  has  to  be  huge.  In  order  to  cut  coal,  oil  consumption  pro-
jected for 2025 by 10 percent, that requires something on the order
of  470  million  tons  of  additional  coalmining  in  this  country.  That
is  a  43  percent  increase  in  today’s  level  of  coalmining.  Unfortu-
nately,  today’s  level  of  coalmining  is  associated  with  a  lot  of  envi-
ronmental damage. We need reform of our coalmining practices be-
fore  we  contemplate  that  magnitude  of  an  increase  in  coal  produc-
tion.

The water use is another issue, and I believe that Dr. Boardman
will address it, but water use for coal-to-liquids technology is large
indeed,  perhaps  as  high  as  12  gallons  for  every  gallon  of  fuel  pro-
duced.

Then there is the impact on the coal market itself. Congressman
Bartlett’s  opening  statement  notes  that  the  reserve  estimates  for
coal,  while  apparently  large,  are  themselves  uncertain.  And  if  we
increase coal production in order to back out oil through the liquid
coal market, the impacts on recoverable reserves could be profound.
In  my  testimony  I  point  out  that  if  we  tried  to  back  out  just  one-
third  of  oil  imports  starting  in  2030,  that  by  2050,  40  percent  of
today’s  estimated  recoverable  coal  reserves  would  be  gone,  and  by
2080, they would all be gone. If we tried to do more than one-third
of oil imports, then the impacts would be that much greater.

There  is  also  the  impact  of  carbon  capture  and  storage.  This
technology would add a large new demand for reservoir space, and
as Dr. Bartis had noticed, has noticed, we already will have a chal-
lenge  with  deploying  carbon  capture  technology  for  the  electric
power sector. So we need to think about that.

In conclusion, let me make a recommendation. Rather than man-
date  a  fuel-specific  approach  or  adopt  incentives  for  a  fuel-specific
approach,  we  need  a  fuel-neutral  approach.  We  should  have  incen-
tives  and  performance  standards  that  reward  entrepreneurs  who
deliver alternatives to oil that do the best job at backing out oil and
do the best job at cutting greenhouse gas emissions. And that is the
approach that we recommend.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID G. HAWKINS

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today  on  the  subject  of  producing  liquid
fuels  from  coal.  My  name  is  David  Hawkins.  I  am  Director  of  the  Climate  Center
at  the  Natural  Resources  Defense  Council  (NRDC).  NRDC  is  a  national,  nonprofit
organization  of  scientists,  lawyers  and  environmental  specialists  dedicated  to  pro-
tecting public health and the environment. Founded in 1970, NRDC has more than
1.2  million  members  and  online  activists  nationwide,  served  from  offices  in  New
York, Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco, Chicago and Beijing, China.

Today’s energy use patterns are responsible for two growing problems that require
action  now  to  keep  them  from  spiraling  out  of  control—oil  dependence  and  global
warming.  Both  are  serious  but  most  important,  both  problems  must  be  addressed
together.  Designing  strategies  that  address  only  oil  dependence  and  ignore  global
warming would be a huge and costly mistake.

Proposals to use coal to make liquid fuels for transportation need to be evaluated
in  the  context  of  the  compelling  need  to  reduce  global  warming  emissions  starting
now and proceeding continuously throughout this century. Because today’s coal min-
ing and use also continues to impose a heavy toll on America’s land, water, and air,
damaging human health and the environment, it is critical to examine the implica-
tions of a substantial liquid coal program on these values as well. The first role for
federal  research  should  be  to  identify  through  comprehensive  studies  the  types  of
vehicles  and  fuels  that  hold  the  best  promise  of  reducing  both  oil  dependence  and
global warming pollution by the amounts required to preserve a climate that allows
us and others to achieve our environmental, economic and security objectives.
Reducing oil dependence

NRDC fully agrees that reducing oil dependence should be a national priority and
that  new  policies  and  programs  are  needed  to  avert  the  mounting  problems  associ-
ated  with  today’s  dependence  and  the  much  greater  dependence  that  lies  ahead  if
we  do  not  act.  A  critical  issue  is  the  path  we  pursue  in  reducing  oil  dependence:
a ‘‘green’’ path that helps us address the urgent problem of global warming and our
need  to  reduce  the  impacts  of  energy  use  on  the  environment  and  human  health;
or  a  ‘‘brown’’  path  that  would  increase  global  warming  emissions  as  well  as  other
health and environmental damage. In deciding what role coal might play as a source
of  transportation  fuel  NRDC  believes  we  must  first  assess  whether  it  is  possible  to
use coal to make liquid fuels without exacerbating the problems of global warming,
conventional air pollution and impacts of coal production and transportation.

If  coal  were  to  play  a  significant  role  in  displacing  oil,  it  is  clear  that  the  enter-
prise  would  be  huge,  so  the  health  and  environmental  stakes  are  correspondingly
huge. The coal company Peabody Energy and its industry allies are seeking govern-
ment  subsidies  to  create  a  coal  to  synfuels  industry  as  large  as  2.6  million  barrels
per  day  of  liquid  fuel  from  coal  by  2025,  about  10  percent  of  forecasted  oil  demand
in  that  year.  According  to  the  industry,  using  coal  to  produce  that  much  synfuel
would require construction of 33 very large liquid coal plants, each plant consuming
14.4  million  tons  of  coal  per  year  to  produce  80,000  barrels  per  day  of  liquid  fuel.
Each of these plants would cost $6.4 billion to build. Total additional coal production
required  for  this  program  would  be  475  million  tons  of  coal  annually-requiring  an
expansion of coal mining of 43 percent above today’s level.1

In  this  testimony  I  will  not  attempt  a  thorough  analysis  of  the  impacts  of  a  pro-
gram  of  this  scale.  Rather,  I  will  highlight  the  issues  that  should  be  addressed  in
a detailed assessment.
Global Warming Pollution

To avoid catastrophic global warming the U.S. and other nations will need to de-
ploy  energy  resources  that  result  in  much  lower  releases  of  CO2 than  today’s  use
of oil, gas and coal. To keep global temperatures from rising to levels not seen since
before  the  dawn  of  human  civilization,  the  best  expert  opinion  is  that  global  green-
house gas emissions need to be cut in half from today’s levels by 2050. To accommo-
date  unavoidable  increases  in  emissions  from  developing  countries  this  will  require
industrialized  countries,  including  the  U.S.,  to  cut  emissions  by  about  80  percent
from today’s levels between now and 2050.

Achieving  emissions  reductions  of  this  scale  in  the  U.S.  will  require  deep  reduc-
tions  in  all  sectors,  especially  in  the  power  generation  and  transportation  sectors,
which  together  account  for  over  two-thirds  of  U.S.  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions.
Achieving  large  reductions  in  transportation  emissions  will  require  action  on  three
fronts:  improved  vehicles;  lower  carbon  fuels;  and  smarter  metropolitan  area  plan-
ning  to  reduce  congestion  and  growth  in  vehicle  miles.  This  is  the  frame  we  must
have  in  mind  in  evaluating  the  viability  of  alternative  fuels  for  the  transportation
sector.  The  fuel  industry  we  build  must  be  capable  of  producing  fuels  that  contain
substantially less fossil carbon than is in today’s petroleum-based gasoline and die-
sel  fuel.  To  help  achieve  the  overall  reductions  we  need  by  2050  will  require  trans-
portation  fuels  with  50–80  percent  lower  fossil  carbon  emission  potential  than  to-
day’s fuels.

To assess the global warming implications of a large liquid coal program we need
to  examine  the  total  life  cycle  or  ‘‘well-to-wheel’’  emissions  of  this  type  of  synfuel.
Coal  is  a  carbon-intensive  fuel,  containing  double  the  amount  of  carbon  per  unit  of

1 The coal industry’s program is set forth in a March 2006 National Coal Council report, Coal:
America’s  Energy  Future.  The  industry’s  full  ‘‘Eight-Point  Plan’’  calls  for  a  total  of  1.3  billion
tons of additional coal production by 2025, proposing that coal be used to produce synthetic pipe-
line  gas,  additional  coal-fired  electricity,  hydrogen,  and  fuel  for  ethanol  plants.  The  entire  pro-
gram would more than double U.S. coal mining and consumption.

energy  compared  to  natural  gas  and  about  50  percent  more  than  petroleum.  When
coal is converted to liquid fuels, two streams of CO2 are produced: one at the liquid
coal  production  plant  and  the  second  from  the  exhausts  of  the  vehicles  that  burn
the  fuel.  As  I  describe  below,  even  if  the  CO2 from  the  synfuel  production  plant  is
captured,  there  is  no  prospect  that  liquid  fuel  made  with  coal  as  the  sole  feedstock
can  achieve  the  significant  reductions  in  fossil  carbon  content  that  we  need  to  pro-
tect the climate.

Two  authoritative  recent  studies  conclude  that  even  if  liquid  coal  synfuels  plants
fully  employ  carbon  capture  and  storage,  full  life  cycle  greenhouse  gas  emissions
from  using  these  fuels  will  be  worse  than  conventional  diesel  fuel.  There  is  a
straightforward  reason  for  this.  Vehicle  tailpipe  CO2 emissions  from  using  liquid
coal would be nearly identical to those from using conventional diesel fuel. Any CO2
emissions released from the synfuels production facility have to be added to the tail-
pipe emissions. The residual emissions from a liquid coal plant employing CO2 cap-
ture  and  geologic  storage  (CCS)  are  still  somewhat  higher  than  emissions  from  a
petroleum refinery, hence life cycle emissions are higher.

EPA’s April 2007 analysis of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of different fuels
was  released  in  conjunction  with  publishing  its  final  rule  to  implement  the  Renew-
able Fuels Standard enacted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. EPA’s analysis finds
that  without  carbon  capture  life  cycle  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  coal-to-liquid
fuels would be more than twice as high as from conventional diesel fuel (118 percent
higher).  Assuming  carbon  capture  and  storage  EPA  finds  that  life  cycle  greenhouse
gas  emissions  from  coal-to-liquid  fuels  would  be  3.7  percent  higher  than  from  con-
ventional diesel fuel.2

In May 2007 Michael Wang of Argonne National Laboratory, the developer of the
most  widely  used  transportation  fuels  life  cycle  emissions  model,  presented  the  re-
sults  of  his  more  detailed  analysis  of  liquid  coal  fuels  to  the  Society  of  Automotive
Engineers conference. The Argonne analysis shows that liquid coal fuels could have
life  cycle  greenhouse  gas  emissions  as  much  as  2.5  times  those  from  conventional
diesel  fuel.  Even  assuming  a  high-efficiency  liquid  coal  conversion  process  and  85
percent  carbon  capture  and  storage,  Argonne  finds  that  life  cycle  greenhouse  gas
emissions  from  liquid  coal  fuel  would  still  be  19  percent  higher  than  from  conven-
tional diesel fuel (Figure 1).3

These analyses show that using coal to produce a significant amount of liquid syn-
fuel  for  transportation  conflicts  with  the  need  to  develop  a  low-CO2 emitting  trans-
portation  sector.  The  unavoidable  fact  is  that  liquid  fuel  made  from  coal  contains
essentially  the  same  amount  of  carbon  as  is  in  gasoline  or  diesel  made  from  petro-
leum.  Given  these  results,  it  is  not  surprising  that  a  recent  Battelle  study  found
that  a  significant  coal-to-liquids  industry  is  not  compatible  with  stabilizing  atmos-
pheric  CO2 concentrations  below  twice  the  pre-industrial  value.  Battelle  found  that
if there is no constraint on CO2 emissions conventional petroleum would be increas-
ingly  replaced  with  liquid  coal,  but  that  in  scenarios  in  which  CO2 concentrations
are  limited  to  550  ppm  or  below,  petroleum  fuels  are  replaced  with  biofuels  rather
than liquid coal (Figure 2).4

Proceeding with liquid coal plants now could leave those investments stranded or
impose  unnecessarily  high  abatement  costs  on  the  economy  if  the  plants  continue
to operate.

Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles

While NRDC believes there are better alternatives than using coal to replace gas-
oline,  it  is  worth  noting  that  making  liquid  fuels  from  coal  is  far  less  efficient  and
dirtier even than burning coal to generate electricity for use in plug-in hybrid vehi-
cles (PHEVs). In fact, a ton of coal used to generate electricity used in a PHEV will
displace  about  twice  as  much  oil  as  using  the  same  amount  of  coal  to  make  liquid
fuels,  even  using  optimistic  assumptions  about  the  conversion  efficiency  of  liquid
coal  plants.5 The  difference  in  CO2 emissions  is  even  more  dramatic.  Liquid  coal
produced  with  CCS  and  used  in  a  hybrid  vehicle  would  still  result  in  life  cycle
greenhouse  gas  emissions  of  approximately  330  grams/mile,  or  ten  times  as  much
as the 33 grams/mile that could be achieve by a PHEV operating on electricity gen-
erated in a coal-fired power plant equipped with CCS.6
Coal and Biomass?

Some have proposed that a mixture of coal and biomass could be used to produce
liquid  fuel  with  a  reduction  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions  compared  to  today’s  fuels,
assuming a high fraction of the CO2 from the production plant is captured and per-
manently  isolated  in  geologic  formations.  Proponents  of  this  concept  argue  that
using such a mixture of feedstocks to make liquid fuel could be compatible with cut-
ting global warming emissions. It is important to recognize that such a combination
does  not  actually  reduce  the  emissions  related  to  using  coal;  rather,  the  biomass
component of the combination actually has negative net emissions that are deducted
from the coal-related emissions to obtain low net emissions from the mixture. More-
over, even if the technical and economic challenges of making fuels with such a mix-
ture  could  be  met,  a  coal-biomass  approach  would  still  result  in  large  amounts  of
additional  coal  mining  and  water  requirements.  With  today’s  mining  practices,
mountaintop removal mining being the most egregious, launching a new fuel indus-
try  that  depends  on  massive  amounts  of  new  mining  without  reform  of  our  current
practices  would  be  a  recipe  for  widespread  environmental  damage.  As  I  discuss
below,  competition  for  water  and  even  for  low-cost  coal  supplies  and  geologic  CO2
storage  reservoirs  are  additional  factors  that  must  be  analyzed  before  we  can  con-

clude  that  any  significant  use  of  coal  for  liquid  fuels  would  be  viable.  Federal  re-
search  could  support  such  analyses.  If  Congress  is  going  to  legislate  on  the  subject
of  liquid  coal,  the  only  responsible  action  now  is  to  require  a  comprehensive  com-
parative assessment of the full life cycle impacts and resource requirements of alter-
native approaches to reducing dependence on petroleum.
Conventional Pollution

Liquid  coal  fuel  itself  is  expected  to  result  in  reduced  emissions  of  conventional
pollutants from vehicle exhausts. However, the same may not be true for liquid coal
production plants. Conventional air emissions from liquid coal plants include sulfur
oxides,  nitrogen  oxides,  particulate  matter,  mercury  and  other  hazardous  metals
and organics. While it appears that technologies exist to achieve high levels of con-
trol for all or most of these pollutants, the operating experience of liquid coal plants
in  South  Africa  demonstrates  that  liquid  coal  plants  are  not  inherently  ‘‘clean.’’  If
such plants are to operate with minimum emissions of conventional pollutants, per-
formance standards will need to be written-standards that do not exist today in the
U.S. as far as we are aware.

In  addition,  the  various  federal  emission  cap  programs  now  in  force  would  apply

to few, if any, liquid coal plants.7

Thus,  we  cannot  say  today  that  liquid  coal  plants  will  be  required  to  meet  strin-
gent  emission  performance  standards  adequate  to  prevent  either  significant  local-
ized impacts or regional emissions impacts.
Mining, Processing and Transporting Coal

The impacts of mining, processing, and transporting 1.1 billion tons of coal today
on  health,  landscapes,  and  water  are  large.  The  industry’s  liquid  coal  vision  advo-
cates  another  475  billion  tons  of  coal  production.  To  understand  the  implications  of
such  an  enormous  expansion  of  coal  production,  it  is  important  to  have  a  detailed
understanding  of  the  impacts  from  today’s  level  of  coal  production.  The  summary
that  follows  makes  it  clear  that  we  must  find  more  effective  ways  to  reduce  these
impacts  before  we  follow  a  path  that  would  result  in  even  larger  amounts  of  coal
production and transportation.
Health and Safety

Coal  mining  is  one  of  the  U.S.’s  most  dangerous  professions.  The  yearly  fatality
rate  in  the  industry  is  0.23  per  thousand  workers,  making  the  industry  about  five
times  as  hazardous  as  the  average  private  workplace.8 The  industry  had  a  low  of
22  fatalities  in  2005  but  in  2006  there  were  47  deaths.9 Fatalities  to  date  in  2007
are  17.10 Coal  miners  also  suffer  from  many  non-fatal  injuries  and  diseases,  most
notably  black  lung  disease  (also  known  as  pneumoconiosis)  caused  by  inhaling  coal
dust.  Although  the  1969  Coal  Mine  Health  and  Safety  Act  seeks  to  eliminate  black
lung  disease,  the  United  Mine  Workers  estimate  that  1500  former  miners  die  of
black lung each year.11
Terrestrial Habitats

Coal mining—and particularly surface or strip mining—poses one of the most sig-
nificant  threats  to  terrestrial  habitats  in  the  United  States.  The  Appalachian  re-
gion,12 for  example,  which  produces  over  35  percent  of  our  nation’s  coal,13 is  one
of  the  most  biologically  diverse  forested  regions  in  the  country.  But  during  surface
mining  activities,  trees  are  clear-cut  and  habitat  is  fragmented,  destroying  natural
areas  that  were  home  to  hundreds  of  unique  species  of  plants  and  animals.  Even
where forests are left standing, fragmentation is of significant concern because a de-
crease in patch size is correlated with a decrease in bio-diversity as the ratio of inte-
rior  habitat  to  edge  habitat  decreases.  This  is  of  particular  concern  to  certain  bird

7 The sulfur and nitrogen caps in EPA’s ‘‘Clean Air Interstate Rule’’ (‘‘CAIR’’) may cover emis-
sions from liquid coal plants built in the eastern states covered by the rule but would not apply
to  plants  built  in  the  western  states.  Neither  the  national  ‘‘acid  rain’’  caps  nor  EPA’s  mercury
rule would apply to liquid coal plants.

species  that  require  large  tracts  of  interior  forest  habitat,  such  as  the  black-and-
white warbler and black-throated blue warbler.

After  mining  is  complete,  these  once-forested  regions  in  the  Southeast  are  typi-
cally  reclaimed  as  grasslands,  although  grasslands  are  not  a  naturally  occurring
habitat type in this region. Grasslands that replace the original ecosystems in areas
that were surface mined are generally categorized by less-developed soil structure14
and  lower  species  diversity15 compared  to  natural  forests  in  the  region.  Reclaimed
grasslands  are  generally  characterized  by  a  high  degree  of  soil  compaction  that
tends  to  limit  the  ability  of  native  tree  and  plant  species  to  take  root.  Reclamation
practices  limit  the  overall  ecological  health  of  sites,  and  it  has  been  estimated  that
the  natural  return  of  forests  to  reclaimed  sites  may  take  hundreds  of  years.16 Ac-
cording to the USEPA, the loss of vegetation and alteration of topography associated
with surface mining can lead to increased soil erosion and may lead to an increased
probability of flooding after rainstorms.17

The  destruction  of  forested  habitat  not  only  degrades  the  quality  of  the  natural
environment,  it  also  destroys  the  aesthetic  values  of  the  Appalachian  region  that
make  it  such  a  popular  tourist  destination.  An  estimated  one  million  acres  of  West
Virginia  mountains  were  subject  to  strip  mining  and  mountaintop  removal  mining
between  1939  and  2005.18 Many  of  these  mines  have  yet  to  be  reclaimed  so  that
where  there  were  once  forested  mountains,  there  now  stand  bare  mounds  of  sand
and gravel.

The terrestrial impacts of coal mining in the Appalachian region are considerable,
but  for  sheer  size  of  the  acreage  affected,  impacts  in  the  western  United  States
dominate the picture.19 As of September 30, 2004, 470,000 acres were under federal
coal  leases  or  other  authorizations  to  mine.20 Unlike  the  East,  much  of  the  West—
including  much  of  the  region’s  principal  coal  areas—is  arid  and  predominantly
unforested. In the West, as in the East, surface mining activities cause severe envi-
ronmental  damage  as  huge  machines  strip,  rip  apart  and  scrape  aside  vegetation,
soils,  wildlife  habitat  and  drastically  reshape  existing  land  forms  and  the  affected
area’s ecology to reach the subsurface coal. Strip mining results in industrialization
of  once  quiet  open  space  along  with  displacement  of  wildlife,  increased  soil  erosion,
loss of recreational opportunities, degradation of wilderness values, and destruction
of scenic beauty.21 Reclamation can be problematic both because of climate and soil
quality. As in the East, reclamation of surface mined areas does not necessarily re-
store  pre-mining  wildlife  habitat  and  may  require  scarce  water  resources  be  used
for irrigation.22 Forty-six western national parks are located within ten miles of an
identified  coal  basin,  and  these  parks  could  be  significantly  affected  by  future  sur-
face mining in the region.23

Water Pollution
Coal production causes negative physical and chemical changes to nearby waters.
In  all  surface  mining,  the  overburden  (Earth  layers  above  the  coal  seams)  is  re-
moved and deposited on the surface as waste rock. The most significant physical ef-
fect  on  water  occurs  from  valley  fills,  the  waste  rock  associated  with  mountaintop
removal (MTR) mining. Studies estimate that over 700 miles of streams were buried
by valley fills from 1985–2001, and 1,200 miles were directly impacted by mountain-
top  removal  and  valley  fills  from  1992–2002.24 Valley  fills  bury  the  headwaters  of
streams,  which  in  the  southeastern  U.S.  support  diverse  and  unique  habitats,  and

regulate nutrients, water quality, and flow quantity. The elimination of headwaters
therefore has long-reaching impacts many miles downstream.25

Coal  mining  can  also  lead  to  increased  sedimentation,  which  affects  both  water
chemistry  and  stream  flow,  and  negatively  impacts  aquatic  habitat.  Valley  fills  in
the  eastern  U.S.,  as  well  as  waste  rock  from  strip  mines  in  the  west  add  sediment
to streams, as does the construction and use of roads in the mining complex. A final
physical impact of mining on water is to the hydrology of aquifers. MTR and valley
fills  remove  upper  drainage  basins,  and  often  connect  two  previously  separate
aquifers, altering the surrounding groundwater recharge scheme.26

Acid mine drainage (AMD) is the most significant form of chemical pollution pro-
duced from coal mining operations. In both underground and surface mining, sulfur-
bearing  minerals  common  in  coal  mining  areas  are  brought  up  to  the  surface  in
waste  rock.  When  these  minerals  come  in  contact  with  precipitation  and  ground-
water, an acidic leachate is formed. This leachate picks up heavy metals and carries
these toxins into streams or groundwater. Waters affected by AMD often exhibit in-
creased levels of sulfate, total dissolved solids, calcium, selenium, magnesium, man-
ganese,  conductivity,  acidity,  sodium,  nitrate,  and  nitrite.  This  drastically  changes
stream  and  groundwater  chemistry.27 The  degraded  water  becomes  less  habitable,
non  potable,  and  unfit  for  recreational  purposes.  The  acidity  and  metals  can  also
corrode  structures  such  as  culverts  and  bridges.28 In  the  eastern  U.S.,  estimates  of
the  damage  from  AMD  range  from  four  to  eleven  thousand  miles  of  streams.29 In
the  West,  estimates  are  between  five  and  ten  thousand  miles  of  streams  polluted.
The  effects  of  AMD  can  be  diminished  through  addition  of  alkaline  substances  to
counteract the acid, but recent studies have found that the addition of alkaline ma-
terial  can  increase  the  mobilization  of  both  selenium  and  arsenic.30 AMD  is  costly
to  mitigate,  requiring  over  $40  million  annually  in  Kentucky,  Tennessee,  Virginia,
and West Virginia alone.31
Air Pollution

There  are  two  main  sources  of  air  pollution  during  the  coal  production  process.
The first is methane emissions from the mines. Methane is a powerful heat-trapping
gas  and  is  the  second  most  important  contributor  to  global  warming  after  carbon
dioxide.  Methane  emissions  from  coal  mines  make  up  between  10  and  15  percent
of anthropogenic methane emissions in the U.S. According to the most recent official
inventory  of  U.S.  global  warming  emissions,  coal  mining  results  in  the  release  of
three  million  tons  of  methane  per  year,  which  is  equivalent  to  68  million  tons  of
carbon dioxide.32

The second significant form of air pollution from coal mining is particulate matter
(PM)  emissions.  While  methane  emissions  are  largely  due  to  eastern  underground
mines,  PM  emissions  are  particularly  serious  at  western  surface  mines.  The  arid,
open and frequently windy region allows for the creation and transport of significant
amounts  of  particulate  matter  in  connection  with  mining  operations.  Fugitive  dust
emissions  occur  during  nearly  every  phase  of  coal  strip  mining  in  the  west.  The
most  significant  sources  of  these  emissions  are  removal  of  the  overburden  through
blasting and use of draglines, truck haulage of the overburden and mined coal, road
grading, and wind erosion of reclaimed areas. PM emissions from diesel trucks and
equipment  used  in  mining  are  also  significant.  PM  can  cause  serious  respiratory
damage  as  well  as  premature  death.33 In  2002,  one  of  Wyoming’s  coal  producing
counties, Campbell County, exceeded its ambient air quality threshold several times,
almost  earning  non-attainment  status.34 Coal  dust  problems  in  the  West  are  likely
to  get  worse  if  the  administration  finalizes  its  January  2006  proposal  to  exempt

mining  (and  other  activities)  from  controls  aimed  at  meeting  the  coarse  PM  stand-
ard.35
Coal Mine Wastes

Coal mining leaves a legacy of wastes long after mining operations cease. One sig-
nificant waste is the sludge that is produced from washing coal. There are currently
over 700 sludge impoundments located throughout mining regions, and this number
continues to grow. These impoundment ponds pose a potential threat to the environ-
ment and human life. If an impoundment fails, the result can be disastrous. In 1972
an  impoundment  break  in  West  Virginia  released  a  flood  of  coal  sludge  that  killed
125  people.  In  the  year  2000  an  impoundment  break  in  Kentucky  involving  more
than 300 million gallons of slurry (30 times the size of the Exxon Valdez spill) killed
all  aquatic  life  in  a  20  mile  diameter,  destroyed  homes,  and  contaminated  much  of
the drinking water in the eastern part of the state.36

Another waste from coal mining is the solid waste rock left behind from tunneling
or  blasting.  This  can  result  in  a  number  of  environmental  impacts  previously  dis-
cussed,  including  acid  mine  drainage.  A  common  problem  with  coal  mine  legacies
is  the  fact  that  if  a  mine  is  abandoned  or  a  mining  company  goes  out  of  business,
the  former  owner  is  under  no  legal  obligation  to  cleanup  and  monitor  the  environ-
mental wastes, leaving the responsibility in the hands of the state.37
Effects on Communities

Coal  mining  can  also  have  serious  impacts  on  nearby  communities.  In  addition
to noise and dust, residents have reported that dynamite blasts can crack the foun-
dations  of  homes,38 and  many  cases  of  subsidence  due  to  the  collapse  of  under-
ground  mines  have  been  documented.  Subsidence  can  cause  serious  damage  to
houses, roads, bridges, and any other structure in the area. Blasting can also cause
damage to wells, and changes in the topography and structure of aquifers can cause
these wells to run dry.

Transportation  of  Coal  Transporting  coal  from  where  it  is  mined  to  where  it  will
be  burned  also  produces  significant  quantities  of  air  pollution  and  other  environ-
mental harms. Diesel-burning trucks, trains, and barges that transport coal release
NOΧ,  SOΧ,  PM,  VOCs  (Volatile  Organic  Chemicals),  CO,  and  CO2 into  the  Earth’s
atmosphere.  Trucks  and  trains  (barge  pollution  data  are  unavailable)  transporting
coal  release  over  600,000  tons  of  NOΧ,  and  over  50,000  tons  of  PM10  into  the  air
annually.39,40 In addition to health risks, black carbon from diesel combustion is an-
other  contributor  to  global  warming.41 Land  disturbance  from  trucks  entering  and
leaving  the  mine  complex  and  coal  dust  along  the  transport  route  also  release  par-
ticles into the air.42 For example, in Sylvester, West Virginia, a Massey Energy coal
processing  plant  and  the  trucks  associated  with  it  spread  so  much  dust  around  the
town  that  ‘‘Sylvester’s  residents  had  to  clean  their  windows  and  porches  and  cars
every day, and keep the windows shut.’’ 43 Even after a lawsuit and a court victory,
residents—who  now  call  themselves  ‘‘Dustbusters’’—still  ‘‘wipe  down  their  windows
and porches and cars.’’ 44

Almost  60  percent  of  coal  in  the  U.S.  is  transported  at  least  in  part  by  train  and
coal  transportation  accounts  for  44  percent  of  rail  freight  ton-miles.45 Some  coal
trains reach more than two miles in length, causing railroad-crossing collisions and
pedestrian  accidents  (there  are  approximately  3,000  such  collisions  and  900  pedes-
trian accidents every year), and interruption in traffic flow (including emergency re-
sponders  such  as  police,  ambulance  services,  and  fire  departments).  Local  commu-
nities  also  have  concerns  about  coal  trucks,  both  because  of  their  size  and  the  dust
they  can  leave  behind.  According  to  one  report,  in  a  Kentucky  town,  coal  trucks
weighing  120  tons  with  their  loads  were  used,  and  ‘‘the  Department  of  Transpor-

appeared.’’ 46 Although  the  coal  company  there  has  now  adopted  a  different  route
for  its  trucks,  community  representatives  in  Appalachia  believe  that  coal  trucks
should be limited to 40 tons.47

Coal is also sometimes transported in a coal slurry pipeline, such as the one used
at the Black Mesa Mine in Arizona. In this process the coal is ground up and mixed
with  water  in  a  roughly  50:50  ratio.  The  resulting  slurry  is  transported  to  a  power
station  through  a  pipeline.  This  requires  large  amounts  of  fresh  groundwater.  To
transport coal from the Black Mesa Mine in Arizona to the Mohave Generating Sta-
tion in Nevada, Peabody Coal pumped over one billion gallons of water from an aq-
uifer  near  the  mine  each  year.  This  water  came  from  the  same  aquifer  used  for
drinking  water  and  irrigation  by  members  of  the  Navajo  and  Hopi  Nations  in  the
area. Water used for coal transport has led to a major depletion of the aquifer, with
more than a 100 foot drop in water level in some wells. In the West, coal transport
through a slurry pipeline places additional stress on an already stressed water sup-
ply.  Maintenance  of  the  pipe  requires  washing,  which  uses  still  more  fresh  water.
Not only does slurry-pipeline transport result in a loss of freshwater, it can also lead
to  water  pollution  when  the  pipe  fails  and  coal  slurry  is  discharged  into  ground  or
surface  water.48 The  Peabody  pipe  failed  12  times  between  1994  and  1999.  The
Black  Mesa  mine  closed  as  of  January  2006.  Its  sole  customer,  the  Mohave  Gener-
ating  Station,  was  shut  down  because  its  emissions  exceeded  current  air  pollution
standards.
Water Requirements for Liquid Coal

Liquid  coal  production  requires  large  quantities  of  water.  According  to  a  USGS
report, thermal electric generation accounted for 39 percent of the freshwater with-
drawn from watersheds in the U.S. in 2000.49 The water use dedicated to liquid coal
production  will  require  water  use  above  and  beyond  current  uses,  competing  with
other needs, including irrigation and public water supply. The withdrawal and con-
sumption  of  water  in  areas  with  water  shortages  will  be  a  major  problem  for  this
industry.  Competing  water  uses,  primarily  for  irrigation,  will  be  a  major  problem
in the West where water rights are established and water is considered a very valu-
able commodity. In the East, competing water uses, primarily from thermal electric
cooling, and water shortages also are beginning to become an issue of concern.

There  are  three  major  uses  of  water  in  a  coal-to-liquids  plant,  (1)  process  water,
(2) boiler feed water and (3) cooling water. According to the Department of Energy’s
Idaho National Lab, approximately 12–14 barrels of water are used for every barrel
of liquid coal.50 Therefore the water requirement necessary to meeting the needs of
an  80,000  BPD  liquid  coal  plant  could  require  sourcing  about  40  million  gallons  of
water per day (14 billion gallons per year). The 40 million gallons of water per day
needed for an 80,000 BPD liquid coal facility is enough water to meet the domestic
needs of more than 200,000 people,51 or one-fifth the population of the State of Mon-
tana.  There  are  already  serious  water  supply  problems  in  Western  states  such  as
Montana and Wyoming where most of our cheap coal supplies are located.

While alternative technologies exist that use less water in the liquid coal produc-
tion  process,  many  of  them  are  more  costly  and  some  may  be  cost  prohibitive.  In
addition, water must be of good quality for use in cooling towers and blow down op-
erations  and  if  water  must  be  treated  before  use  that  will  add  additional  costs  to
the plant operations Some research is suggesting the option of using coal bed meth-
ane  water  as  an  alternative  water  source  and  this  is  only  possible  if  this  water’s
salinity  is  low  or  if  desalinization  costs  were  low.  According  to  NETL,  much  of  the
water  produced  from  coal  bed  methane  operations  is  very  saline  and  needs  to  be
treated prior to surface discharge or plant use.52 Therefore, cost-effective sources of

water  and  technologies  that  use  water  more  efficiently  in  these  processes  are  lim-
ited.
Coal Resource Requirements

While  it  is  frequently  said  that  America  has  more  than  250  years  of  coal  to  use,
these  claims  are  based  current  coal  production  of  about  one  billion  tons  per  year.
As  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  (NAS)  has  concluded,  even  with  current  con-
sumption rates, it is ‘‘not possible to confirm’’ the 250 year supply claim because this
estimate  is  based  on  ‘‘methods  that  have  not  been  reviewed  or  revised  since  their
inception  in  1974’’  and  that  updated  methods  suggest  that  ‘‘only  a  small  fraction  of
previously estimated reserves are actually minable reserves.’’ 53

These observations indicate we should reconsider proposals to legislate incentives
and  mandates  for  programs  like  liquid  coal  that  would  dramatically  increase  our
rates of coal consumption. As mentioned above, if all of the coal industry’s wish list
for coal use were implemented, coal production would more than double. Apart from
the  environmental  and  health  threats  presented  by  this  scenario,  there  are  poten-
tially  large  adverse  economic  impacts  from  a  program  to  increase  coal  consumption
on this scale.

Consider the following thought experiment. What would be the impact on U.S. re-
coverable coal reserves if we were to try to displace some significant fraction of U.S.
oil  imports  with  liquid  coal?  Current  U.S.  coal  recoverable  reserve  estimates,  using
methods  criticized  by  the  NAS  as  possibly  overstating  actual  minable  coal,  amount
to  just  under  270  billion  tons.  Suppose  the  U.S.  were  to  ramp  up  a  liquid  coal  of
size  large  enough  to  replace  one-third  to  one  hundred  per  cent  of  forecasted  U.S.
oil imports by 2030? U.S. EIA forecasts that net oil imports (crude and refined prod-
ucts)  in  2030  will  be  about  16  million  barrels  a  day.54 Using  the  National  Coal
Council’s  estimate  of  conversion  efficiency,  to  replace  one-third  of  those  imports
would  require  consumption  of  nearly  1.2  billion  tons  of  additional  coal  per  year  in
2030 and if oil import demand increased at two percent per year, by 2050 coal con-
sumption  to  displace  this  same  fraction  of  imports  would  grow  to  nearly  1.8  billion
tons per year. When combined with continued use of coal for electric power, this rate
of  coal  consumption  would  consume  40  percent  of  currently  estimated  recoverable
reserves  by  2050  and  would  deplete  all  of  those  reserves  by  about  2080.55 If  liquid
coal  production  were  scaled  to  a  level  needed  to  replace  one-half  of  forecasted  oil
imports,  49  percent  of  estimated  recoverable  reserves  would  be  consumed  by  2050
and  100  percent  by  the  year  2074  and  if  we  tried  to  replace  all  of  our  forecasted
oil  imports  with  liquid  coal  then  two-thirds  of  recoverable  reserves  would  be  con-
sumed by 2050 and 100 percent by the year 2060.

The  above  is  a  thought  experiment,  not  a  prediction  that  we  would  actually  run
out  of  coal  by  those  dates.  Economists  will  argue  that  more  reserves  will  become
‘‘recoverable’’  as  the  price  rises.  But  as  the  argument  suggests,  such  new  reserves
will be more expensive than today’s coal supplies.

The point we must recognize is that using coal to make liquid fuel will at a min-
imum raise coal prices substantially for all uses, including the electric power indus-
try,  which  now  depends  on  coal  to  produce  over  50  percent  of  U.S.  electricity.  It  is
also  worth  noting  that  the  massive  amounts  of  CO2 that  would  have  to  be  injected
into geologic formations to limit emissions from liquid coal production will also drive
up the cost of coal use. While it appears the U.S. has large amounts of geologic stor-
age  capacity,  as  with  all  resources  there  is  a  supply  cost  curve  and  with  the  large
demand for storage capacity created by a significant liquid coal industry those costs
will escalate faster than if demand is more moderate.

In  short,  there  is  no  basis  to  assume  that  liquid  coal  would  be  an  economic  bar-

gain either, providing one more reason for us to look for a better way.
A Responsible Action Plan

The impacts that a large liquid coal program could have on global warming pollu-
tion, conventional air pollution and damage from expanded coal production are sub-
stantial—so  substantial  that  using  coal  to  make  liquid  fuel  would  likely  create  far
worse problems than it attempts to solve.

Fortunately,  the  U.S.  can  have  a  robust  and  effective  program  to  reduce  oil  de-
pendence without embracing liquid coal technologies. A combination of efficiency, re-
newable  fuels  and  plug-in  hybrid  vehicles  can  reduce  our  oil  consumption  more

55 For  this  calculation  we  assume  a  one  percent  per  year  growth  rate  in  coal  consumption  in

of ‘‘business as usual’’ practices.

quickly,  more  cleanly  and  in  larger  amounts  than  liquid  coal  even  on  the  massive
scale advocated by the coal industry.

A  combination  of  more  efficient  cars,  trucks  and  planes,  biofuels,  and  ‘‘smart
growth’’  transportation  options  outlined  in  report  ‘‘Securing  America,’’  produced  by
NRDC and the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, can cut oil dependence
by more than three million barrels a day in 10 years, and achieve cuts of more than
11  million  barrels  a  day  by  2025,  far  outstripping  the  2.6  million  barrel  a  day  pro-
gram being promoted by the coal industry.

The  Securing  America  program  is  made  up  of  these  sensible  steps  that  will  cut
oil dependence, cut global warming emissions, and reduce other harmful impacts of
today’s energy production and consumption patterns:

Accelerate oil savings in passenger vehicles by:

• establishing  tax  credits  for  manufacturers  to  retool  existing  factories  so  they

can build fuel-efficient vehicles and engineer advanced technologies, and

• establishing tax credits for consumers to purchase the next generation of fuel-
efficient  vehicles;  and  raising  federal  fuel  economy  standards  for  cars  and
light trucks in regular steps.

Accelerate oil savings in motor vehicles through the following:

• requiring  replacement  tires  and  motor  oil  to  be  at  least  as  fuel  efficient  as

original equipment tires and motor oil;

• requiring efficiency improvements in heavy-duty trucks; and
• supporting smart growth and better transportation choices.

Accelerate  oil  savings  in  industrial,  aviation,  and  residential  building  sectors

through the following:

• expanding  industrial  efficiency  programs  to  focus  on  oil  use  reduction  and

adopting standards for petroleum heating;

• replacing chemical feedstocks with bioproducts through research and develop-

ment and government procurement of bioproducts;

• upgrading air traffic management systems so aircraft follow the most-efficient

routes; and

• promoting residential energy savings with a focus on oil-heat.
Encourage growth of the biofuels industry through the following:

• requiring  all  new  cars  and  trucks  to  be  capable  of  operating  on  biofuels  or

other non-petroleum fuels by 2015; and

• allocating $2 billion in federal funding over the next 10 years to help the cel-
lulosic biofuels industry expand production capacity to one billion gallons per
year and become self-sufficient by 2015.

To cut our dependence on oil we should follow a simple rule: start with the meas-
ures  that  will  produce  the  quickest,  cleanest  and  least  expensive  reductions  in  oil
use; measures that will put us on track to achieve the reductions in global warming
emissions we need to protect the climate. If we are thoughtful about the actions we
take,  our  country  can  pursue  an  energy  path  that  enhances  our  security,  our  econ-
omy, and our environment.

BIOGRAPHY FOR DAVID G. HAWKINS

David  G.  Hawkins  began  his  work  in  ‘‘public  interest’’  law  upon  graduation  from
Columbia University Law School in 1970. He joined the Natural Resources Defense
Council’s Washington, DC office in 1971 as one of the organization’s first staff mem-
bers.

In 1977, Mr. Hawkins was appointed by President Carter to be Assistant Admin-
istrator for Air, Noise, and Radiation at the Environmental Protection Agency. Dur-
ing  his  time  at  EPA,  he  was  responsible  for  initiating  major  new  programs  under
the 1977 Amendments to the Clean Air Act.

With  President  Reagan’s  election  in  1981,  Mr.  Hawkins  returned  to  NRDC  to  co-

direct NRDC’s Clean Air Program.

In  1990,  Mr.  Hawkins  became  Director  of  NRDC’s  Air  and  Energy  Program,  and
in  2001  he  became  the  Director  of  NRDC’s  Climate  Center.  The  Climate  Center  fo-
cuses  on  advancing  policies  and  programs  to  reduce  the  pollution  responsible  for
global warming. In addition to working with Congress to design a legislative mecha-
nism that will slow, stop and reduce the emissions of global warming pollution, Mr.
Hawkins is recognized as an expert on advanced coal technologies and carbon diox-
ide capture and storage.

Mr.  Hawkins  currently  serves  on  the  boards  of  the  Center  for  Clean  Air  Policy,
Resources  for  the  Future  and  the  Board  on  Environmental  and  Energy  Systems  of
the  National  Academy  of  Sciences.  He  is  also  a  member  of  the  U.S.  Department  of
Energy’s  Climate  Change  Science  Program  Product  Development  Advisory  Com-
mittee.  Mr.  Hawkins  participated  in  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate
Change’s  Special  Report  on  Carbon  Dioxide  Capture  and  Storage  and  is  partici-
pating in the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report on climate change.

Mr. Hawkins is married with three children and lives in Bethesda, MD.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Dr. Hawkins.
Dr. Romm.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  JOSEPH  ROMM,  FORMER  ACTING  ASSIST-
ANT  SECRETARY,  OFFICE  OF  ENERGY  EFFICIENCY  AND  RE-
NEWABLE ENERGY, DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY; SENIOR FEL-
LOW, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS
Dr.  ROMM.  Thank  you.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members
of  the  Committee.  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  share  my  views
on liquid coal.

I  will—just  two  key  questions.  First,  should  Congress  promote
coal  as  a  transportation  fuel?  And  second,  if  Congress  does,  will
people actually drive their cars with liquid coal? I think the answer
to both questions is decidedly no.

Congress  should  really  promote  only  those  technologies  and
strategies  that  provide  significant  and  net  societal  benefit.  Liquid
coal  does  not  provide  net  societal  benefit.  Worse,  it  will  actually
cause  societal  harm.  Liquid  coal  would  increase  greenhouse  gas
emissions,  use  up  increasingly  scarce  water  supplies,  and  divert
hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars  from  crucial  clean  energy  solutions.
We  simply  have  run  out  of  time  to  waste  money  and  resources
on liquid coal because global warming is happening faster than sci-
entists  had  warned.  Sea  ice  loss,  ice  sheet  loss,  temperature  rise,
sea level rise, hurricane intensity, and expansion of the tropics, all
of them are happening faster than scientists expected.

We  all  want  to  avoid  catastrophic  warming  such  as  80  foot  sea
level  rise,  and  that  means  limiting  future  warming  to  two  degrees
Fahrenheit,  and  that  requires  mandatory  cuts  in  greenhouse  gas
emissions  of  60  to  80  percent  by  2050,  as  many  bills  before  Con-
gress  would  require.  And  it  certainly  doesn’t  make  any  sense  for
Congress to pursue on the one hand reducing fossil fuel, CO2 emis-

sions dramatically on the one hand and then on the other hand sig-
nificantly promoting it with coal-to-liquids.

It  is  true  that  carbon  dioxide  emissions  that,  as  Dr.  Hawkins
said, carbon dioxide emissions from coal to diesel are about double
that  of  conventional  diesel.  It  is  true  that  you  could  possibly  cap-
ture the carbon dioxide and store it underground permanently, but
that will make an expensive and complicated process even more ex-
pensive and complicated so it seems unlikely for the foreseeable fu-
ture.

I  would  also  add  that  there  is  no  evidence  whatsoever  that  this
country  is  at  all  serious  about  carbon  capture  and  storage.  If  we
were serious about carbon capture and storage, we would be doing
decidedly  different  things.  We  would  have  a  price  for  carbon  diox-
ide, without which there will be no carbon capture and storage, and
we  would  start  identifying  and  certifying  repositories  for  carbon
capture, for carbon storage, which we haven’t even begun doing.

I would also add as I explained in my testimony, that using car-
bon  dioxide  for  enhanced  oil  recovery  is  not  sequestration.  Why?
Because  the  carbon  dioxide  squeezes  more  oil  out  of  the  ground.
You  then  burn  that  oil,  and  you  release  the  carbon  dioxide  again.
So you haven’t accomplished anything.

I would also add, and this is important, that when you are done
with  the  carbon  capture  and  storage,  if  you  happen  to  do  it,  you
are still left with diesel fuel, which is a carbon-intensive liquid fuel
that  will  release  its  carbon  into  the  atmosphere  once  it  is  burned
in  an  internal  combustion  engine.  We  are  going  to  need  to  reduce
diesel  consumption  and  all  liquid  petroleum  consumption  60  to  80
percent by mid century. So we don’t need to figure out ways to in-
crease it.

The  future  of  coal  in  a  carbon-constrained  world  is  not  lique-
faction  plus  carbon  capture  and  storage.  The  future  of  coal  is  elec-
tricity generation with carbon capture and storage since that is car-
bon  free.  A  2006,  study  by  the  University  of  California  found  that
a  significant  use  of  coal  to  diesel  could  increase  annual  emissions
by  seven  billion  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  for  several  decades.  That  is
more  than  current  U.S.  carbon  emissions  and  would  certainly  be
fatal to any effort to avoid catastrophic warming.

Instead  of  liquid  coal,  Congress  needs  to  address  the  climate
problem by establishing a cap on emissions that creates a price for
carbon dioxide. What would be the impact of that cap when you ul-
timately put it in place? The U.S. Energy Information Administra-
tion has actually done a number of studies on this. In one analysis
EIA  modeled  a  carbon  dioxide  permit  price  reaching  only  $14  in
2030,  a  relatively  low  price,  considerably  lower  than  the  current
price  for  carbon  dioxide  in  Europe.  Yet  this  low  price  reduced  pro-
jected liquid coal production by 85 percent in 2030.

A  second  EIA  analysis  showed  that  even  a  moderate  price  for
carbon  dioxide  wipes  out  all  projected  liquid  coal  plants.  So  Con-
gress is going to be passing laws in the next few years that are es-
sentially going to render all liquid coal uneconomic.

Coal-to-liquid  is  just  a  dead  end  from  a  climate  perspective  and
from  a  water  perspective,  too.  You  have  heard  what  Dr.  Hawkins
said.  We  are  in  a  world  that  is  facing  mega  droughts  and  chronic
water  shortages  from  human-caused  climate  change,  and  in  fact,

58

water  demand  is  one  reason  chronically-water-short  China  has
raised  the  capital  threshold  for  liquid  coal  projects  in  an  effort  to
scale back growth.

Time has simply run out in the race to avoid catastrophic warm-
ing.  We  no  longer  have  the  luxury  of  grossly  misallocating  capital
and  fuels  to  expensive  boondoggles  like  coal-to-liquid.  Liquid  coal
will not have a future in this country, no matter how much money
Congress squanders on it. I think Congress should not allocate sig-
nificant  funds  to  liquid  coal,  R&D,  or  other  measures  to  promote
liquid  coal.  The  future  of  coal  in  the  carbon-constrained  world,
again,  is  in  the  form  of  electricity  generation  with  carbon  capture
and storage.

And as Dr. Hawkins said, if coal has a future as a transportation
fuel,  it  is  with  plug-in  hybrids  running  on  zero  carbon  electricity
generated from coal with carbon capture and storage.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOSEPH ROMM

Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  am  delighted  to  appear  before  you
today  to  discuss  the  subject  of  liquid  fuel  from  coal.  I  am  a  Senior  Fellow  at  the
Center  for  American  Progress  here  in  Washington,  DC  where  I  run  the  blog
ClimateProgress.org.  I  am  author  of  the  recent  book  Hell  and  High  Water:  Global
Warming—the Solution and the Politics (Morrow, 2007) and have published and lec-
tured widely on energy and climate issues.

I  served  as  Acting  Assistant  Secretary  at  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy’s  Office
of  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy  during  1997  and  Principal  Deputy  As-
sistant  Secretary  from  1995  though  1998.  In  that  capacity,  I  helped  manage  the
largest  program  in  the  world  for  working  with  businesses  to  develop  and  use  clean
energy technologies. I hold a Ph.D. in physics from M.I.T.

We  are  all  grappling  with  how  best  to  avoid  catastrophic  global  warming.  I  will
argue coal-to-liquids is not part of the solution—and would in fact make the problem
worse.  The  following  figure,  based  on  EPA  data,  shows  the  estimated  change  in
greenhouse gas emissions from various alternative fuels:

I appreciate the opportunity to share my views on coal-to-liquids, which are based
on numerous discussions with leading energy experts; research and analysis for my
book  and  for  the  National  Commission  on  Energy  Policy;  and  participation  in  the
Defense  Science  Board  Task  Force  on  Department  of  Defense  Energy  Strategy,
which heard a number of briefings on liquid coal, including from the Jason’s defense
advisory  group.  All  references  in  this  testimony  can  be  found  in  my  book  or  on  my
blog.
BACKGROUND

The question of the role of coal-to-liquids can play in the national energy mix can
be  understood  only  with  a  full  appreciation  of  the  scale  of  climate  mitigation  the
Nation and the world must pursue. Global concentrations of carbon dioxide, the pri-
mary  greenhouse  gas,  are  rising  at  an  accelerating  rate  in  recent  years—and  they
are  already  higher  than  at  any  time  in  the  past  three  million  years.  The  scientific
consensus,  as  reflected  in  the  work  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate
Change (IPCC), appears to be seriously underestimating the rate of climate change:
• ‘‘The recent [Arctic] sea-ice retreat is larger than in any of the (19) IPCC [cli-
mate]  models’’—and  that  was  a  Norwegian  expert  in  2005.  The  retreat  has
accelerated in the past two years.
• The  ice  sheets  appear  to  be  shrinking  ‘‘100  years  ahead  of  schedule.’’  That
was Penn State climatologist Richard Alley in March 2006. In 2001, the IPCC

thought that neither Greenland nor Antarctica would lose significant mass by
2100. They both already have.

• The  temperature  rise  from  1990  to  2005—0.33°C—was  ‘‘near  the  top  end  of

the range’’ of IPCC climate model predictions.

• Sea-level  rise  from  1993  and  2006—3.3  millimeters  per  year  as  measured  by

satellites—was higher than the IPCC climate models predicted.

• Atlantic  hurricane  intensity  appears  to  be  increasing  faster  than  the  models

• The tropics are expanding faster than the models project.
• Since 2000, carbon dioxide emissions have grown faster than any IPCC model

projected.

had projected.

Worse, the ocean’s heat content will keep re-radiating heat into the Earth’s atmos-
phere  even  after  we  eliminate  the  heat  imbalance,  meaning  the  planet  will  keep
warming  and  the  glaciers  keep  melting  for  decades  after  we  cut  greenhouse  gas
emissions. Therefore, we must act in an ‘‘anticipatory’’ fashion and reduce emissions
long before climate change is painfully obvious to everyone.

The planet has warmed about 0.8°C since the mid-19th century, primarily because
of  human-generated  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  If  we  don’t  sharply  reverse  the  in-
crease  in  global  greenhouse  gas  emissions  within  the  next  decade,  we  will  be  com-
mitting the world to an additional 2° to 3°C warming by century’s end, temperatures
not seen for millions of years, when Greenland and much of Antarctica were ice free,
and sea levels were 80 feet higher.

How  fast  can  the  sea  level  rise?  Following  the  last  ice  age,  the  world  saw  sus-
tained  melting  that  raised  sea  levels  more  than  a  foot  a  decade.  NASA’s  Dr.  James
Hansen—the country’s leading climate scientist—believes we could see such a cata-
strophic  melting  rate  within  the  century,  as  do  many  others  I  interviewed  for  my
book.  Other  potential  devastating  threats  from  unrestricted  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions  include  widespread  drought  and  desertification,  including  in  the  American
southwest,  and  an  increase  in  extreme  weather  of  all  kinds,  including  heat  waves,
hurricanes, and severe rainstorms.

To  avoid  this  fate,  we  must  sharply  reduce  global  carbon  dioxide  emissions  from
fossil  fuel  combustion.  As  an  example  of  the  kind  of  reductions  required  by  climate
change,  both  Florida  Governor  Charlie  Crist  and  California  Governor  Arnold
Schwarzenegger have committed their states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to
80  percent  below  1990  levels  by  2050.  The  United  States  Climate  Action  Partner-
ship—a group of Fortune 500 companies and leading environmental organizations—
has  embraced  60  percent  to  80  percent  cuts  by  2050.  Former  Prime  Minister  Tony
Blair  committed  the  United  Kingdom  to  a  60  percent  reduction  by  2050.  The  IPCC
says  all  industrialized  nations,  including  the  United  States,  need  to  achieve  reduc-
tions  of  50  percent  to  80  percent  to  avoid  the  worst  of  global  warming—and  that
requires  emissions  to  peak  in  the  next  decade.  Many  bills  have  been  introduced  to
Congress to achieve such cuts. The question is where does liquid coal fit in U.S. ef-
forts to achieve such cuts?
NO ROLE FOR LIQUID COAL

Coal  and  natural  gas  can  be  converted  to  diesel  fuel  using  the  Fischer-Tropsch
process. During World War II, coal gasification and liquefaction produced more than
half of the liquid fuel used by the German military. South Africa has employed this
process for decades.

The  process  is  not  more  widely  used  today  in  large  part  because  it  is  incredibly
expensive.  It  costs  $5  billion  or  more  just  to  build  a  plant  capable  of  producing
80,000  barrels  of  oil  a  day  (the  U.S.  currently  consumes  more  than  21  million  bar-
rels a day).

Five  to  seven  gallons  of  water  are  necessary  for  every  gallon  of  diesel  fuel  that’s
produced  (and  double  that  if  you  co-produce  diesel  fuel  and  electricity  from  coal),
according  to  the  June  2006  report,  ‘‘Emerging  Issues  for  Fossil  Energy  and  Water:
Investigation  of  Water  Issues  Related  to  Coal  Mining,  Coal  to  Liquids,  Oil  Shale,
and Carbon Capture and Sequestration’’ by DOE’s National Energy Technology Lab-
oratory. Here is the key figure from the report:

61

This  is  not  a  particularly  good  long-term  strategy  in  a  nation  and  a  world  facing
mega-droughts  and  chronic  water  shortages  from  human-caused  climate  change.
The heavy water demand is one reason chronically water-short China has raised the
capital threshold for liquid coal projects in an effort to scale back growth.

Worse than the water issue, the total carbon dioxide emissions from coal-to-diesel
are  about  double  that  of  conventional  diesel,  as  the  earlier  figure  shows.  It  is  pos-
sible  to  capture  the  carbon  dioxide  from  the  process  and  store  it  underground  per-
manently.  But  that  will  make  an  expensive  process  even  more  expensive,  so  it
seems unlikely for the foreseeable future, certainly not until carbon dioxide is regu-
lated and has a high price and we have a number of certified underground geologic
repositories.

More  importantly,  even  with  the  capture  and  storage  of  CO2 from  the  Fischer-
Tropsch  process,  the  final  product  is  diesel  fuel,  a  carbon-intensive  liquid  that  will
release CO2 into the atmosphere once it is burned in an internal combustion engine.
A  great  many  people  I  have  spoken  to  are  confused  about  this  point:  They  think
that  capturing  and  storing  the  CO2 while  turning  coal  to  diesel  is  as  good  an  idea
as capturing the CO2 from the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) process
for  turning  coal  into  electricity.  No.  The  former  process  still  leaves  a  carbon-inten-
sive fuel, whereas the latter process yields near zero-carbon electricity.

The future of coal in a carbon-constrained world is electricity generation with car-
bon  capture  and  storage,  not  CTL  plus  carbon  capture  and  storage.  Capturing  and
storing even one gigaton of carbon a year requires a flow of carbon dioxide into the
ground  equal  to  the  current  flow  of  oil  out  of  the  ground.  That  by  itself  represents
an  enormous  engineering  challenge.  We  need  to  devote  the  vast  majority  of  this
level  of  sequestration  effort  to  power  production,  to  generation  of  zero-carbon  elec-
tricity  from  coal,  not  to  generation  of  an  endless  stream  of  carbon-intensive  liquid
fuel  like  Fischer-Tropsch  diesel.  Worse,  some  people  propose  taking  the  captured
CO2 and using it for enhanced oil recovery, which, as discussed below, is the equiva-
lent of not capturing the carbon dioxide at all.

Coal  to  diesel  is  a  bad  idea  for  the  Nation  and  the  planet.  If  the  United  States
pursues  it  aggressively,  catastrophic  climate  change  will  be  all  but  unavoidable.
Turning  natural  gas  into  diesel  is  not  as  bad  an  idea,  at  least  from  the  perspective
of direct emissions, because natural gas is a low-carbon fuel. But it represents a tre-
mendous  misuse  of  natural  gas,  which  could  otherwise  be  used  to  reduce  future
greenhouse gas emissions.

A  2006  study  by  the  University  of  California  at  Berkeley  found  that  meeting  the
future  demand  shortfall  from  conventional  oil  with  unconventional  oil,  especially
coal-to-diesel,  could  increase  annual  emissions  by  2.0  billion  metric  tons  of  carbon
(7.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide) for several decades. That is more than current total
U.S.  carbon  emissions  and  would  certainly  be  fatal  to  any  effort  to  avoid  3°C  in-
crease  in  average  worldwide  temperature.  Indeed,  in  a  liquid  coal  scenario,  a  tri-
pling  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions  by  century’s  end  seems  likely,  which  would  likely
leave  the  planet  5°C  warmer  than  preindustrial  levels  by  2100—a  temperature  not
seen since before Antarctica had ice, when sea levels were 280 feet higher than cur-
rent  levels.  Again,  avoiding  3°C  requires  a  substantial  decrease  in  total  upstream
and downstream carbon emissions from oil by mid-century.

EIA PREDICTS CARBON PRICE FATAL TO LIQUID COAL

Instead  of  promoting  of  liquid  coal,  Congress  must  address  the  climate  problem
by establishing a cap on emissions that creates a price for carbon dioxide. What will
be the impact on liquid coal of a carbon cap? Two recent reports by the U.S. Energy
Information Administration (EIA) provide the answer.

In  its  January  2007  report,  ‘‘Energy  Market  and  Economic  Impacts  of  a  Proposal
to  Reduce  Greenhouse  Gas  Intensity  with  a  Cap  and  Trade  System,’’  EIA  examined
the impact of a draft version of Sen. Jeff Bingaman’s global warming bill. That bill
has a safety valve, which limits the price of carbon dioxide permits. In the EIA anal-
ysis, the permit price starts around $4 a ton of carbon dioxide in 2012, rises to $7.15
in  2020  and  reaches  only  $14.18  in  2030.  This  is  a  relatively  low  price  for  carbon
dioxide. Indeed, this 2030 price is considerably lower than the current price for car-
bon  dioxide  in  the  European  Union—and  the  first  budget  year  for  Kyoto  isn’t  even
until next year. In this scenario, EIA finds:

in  2020,  CTL  production  is  0.2  million  barrels  per  day  (74  percent)  lower  than
in the reference case. By 2030, the change is 0.6 million barrels per day (85 per-
cent) lower than in the reference case.

In  short,  a  relatively  low  price  for  carbon  dioxide  wipes  out  the  vast  majority  of

projected CTL.

In  July  2007,  EIA  released  ‘‘Energy  Market  and  Economic  Impacts  of  S.  280,  the
Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act of 2007,’’ an analysis of the global warming
bill  by  Senators  John  McCain  and  Joe  Lieberman.  S.  280  sets  considerably  more
stringent reduction targets than Sen. Bingaman’s draft bill—ultimately reaching 60
percent below 1990 emissions levels by 2050. This bill has no safety valve. As a re-
sult,  the  permit  price  reaches  $22.20  in  2020  and  hits  $47.90  in  2030.  The  report
finds:

None of the 15 coal-to-liquids plants built in the reference case are pro-
jected to come on line in the main S. 280 cases. In the reference case [busi-
ness  as  usual],  coal  consumption  at  CTL  plants  reaches  109  million  tons  in
2030.

A moderate price for carbon dioxide wipes out all projected CTL.
Since  it  is  all  but  inevitable  that  we  will  have  a  low-to-moderate  price  of  carbon
dioxide  by  2020,  and  at  least  a  moderate  price  by  2030,  CTL  will  not  achieve  any
significant  market  penetration.  No  amount  of  federal  research  and  development  in-
vestment or tax credits or loan guarantees are likely to change that equation.
CTL  FOR  ENHANCED  OIL  RECOVERY  DOES  NOT  HELP  THE  CLIMATE
The carbon dioxide from CTL could be used to squeeze more oil out of the ground
by  injecting  it  into  a  well  where  it  would  be  sequestered  permanently.  It  might  be
argued  that  the  carbon  dioxide  could  have  dual  value—for  enhanced  oil  recovery
(EOR)  and  as  a  certified  greenhouse  gas  emission  reduction—and  that  such  a  dual
value would make CTL more economical.

That,  however,  makes  neither  environmental  nor  economic  sense.  The  key  ratio
is  carbon  dioxide  injected  vs.  carbon  dioxide  released  from  recovered  oil.  BP  and
UCLA did such a life cycle analysis in 2001 and concluded, ‘‘the EOR activity is al-
most  carbon-neutral  when  comparing  net  storage  potential  and  gasoline  emissions
from the additional oil extracted.’’ And that may be optimistic. The study notes:

The results presented reflect only gasoline consumption but do not take into ac-
count  the  additional  emissions  that  would  originate  from  the  refining  process,
nor  the  emissions  arising  from  the  combustion  of  the  other  products  of  crude
oil such as diesel, bunker or jet fuels.

In short, the carbon dioxide used to recover the oil is less than the carbon dioxide
released from that oil when you include the carbon dioxide released from 1) burning
all the refined products and 2) the refining process itself. For that reason, no nation
should give carbon credits for carbon dioxide used for EOR.

The  study,  however,  has  a  different  conclusion:  ‘‘utilizing  captured  and  recycled
CO2 instead of using CO2 exclusively from natural reservoirs reduces greenhouse gas
emissions  to  the  atmosphere  from  EOR’’  (emphasis  added).  This  is  true  because
most carbon dioxide used for EOR today comes from ‘‘natural reservoirs.’’

But the Nation and the world have barely touched the full potential of EOR even
though  it  can  potentially  double  the  oil  output  from  a  well  that  has  undergone  pri-
mary and secondary recovery. Why? As a 2005 Department of Energy press release
on an EOR-sequestration project noted, ‘‘much of the CO2 used in similar U.S. EOR
projects has been taken at considerable expense from naturally occurring reservoirs’’
(emphasis added).

Cheap, widely available carbon dioxide would be a game-changer for oil recovery.
The DOE carefully studied EOR and came to an amazing conclusion in 2006. In the
U.S. alone, ‘‘next generation CO2-EOR technology’’ and ‘‘widespread sequestration of
industrial  carbon  dioxide’’  could  add  a  stunning  ‘‘160  billion  barrels  of  domestic  oil
recovery.’’  The  combustion  of  that  oil  would  produce  more  than  60  billion  tonnes  of
CO2, equivalent to ten times annual U.S. CO2 emissions.

A  CTL  project  where  the  carbon  dioxide  is  captured  and  used  for  new  EOR  is  a
doubly bad idea from a climate perspective. Nor does it solve the problem of oil de-
pendency. As President Bush has said, ‘‘we are addicted to oil’’ and ‘‘we need to get
off oil.’’ Achieving those goals while sharply reducing greenhouse gas emissions can
be accomplished only with cars that are significantly more fuel-efficient running on
low-carbon  alternative  fuels,  such  as  cellulosic  ethanol  or  electricity  from  zero-car-
bon sources for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.
CONCLUSION

We  are  simply  running  out  of  time  to  avoid  catastrophic  warming,  and  we  no
longer have the luxury of grossly misallocating capital and fuels to expensive boon-
doggles  like  coal-to-liquid.  Because  of  the  urgent  need  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas
emissions—because  Congress  is  finally  considering  the  passage  of  a  cap  and  trade
system to reduce emissions—CTL should have little future in this country.

Congress  should  certainly  not  allocate  significant  funds  to  CTL  R&D,  nor  should
it  take  other  measures  to  promote  CTL.  The  future  of  coal  in  a  carbon  constrained
world  is  in  the  form  of  electricity  generation  with  carbon  capture  and  storage.  And
if  coal  has  a  future  as  a  transportation  fuel,  it  is  with  plug  in  hybrids  running  on
such  zero-carbon  coal  electricity.  For  these  reasons,  accelerating  the  transition  to
such zero-carbon power is where Congress should be focusing its time and resources.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  RICHARD  D.  BOARDMAN,  SENIOR  CON-
SULTING  RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT  LEAD,  IDAHO  NA-
TIONAL LABORATORY
Dr.  BOARDMAN.  I  am  honored  to  be  invited  to  contribute  to  the
discussion about the benefits and challenges of converting coal into
liquid transportation fuels.

I  have  submitted  a  lengthy  testimony  to  you,  but  time  will  not
permit  me  to  draw  your  attention  but  only  to  a  very  few  of  the
most selling points in that document. My remarks are based on my
personal  and  professional  knowledge  and  do  not  reflect  the  views
of the Department of Energy (DOE).

Please direct your attention, if you would, please, to the drawing
in  the  lengthy  document  on  page  6  of  my  testimony,  which  shows
the  life  cycle  of  carbon  obtained  from  biomass  and  coal  when  it  is
utilized  to  produce  synthetic  fuels,  electric  power,  and  chemical
products.  This  figure  depicts  the  plan  that  Baard  Energy  is  devel-
oping for a site in Ohio.

Baard  Energy  and  the  Idaho  National  Lab  (INL)  entered  into  a
cooperative  research  and  development  agreement  to  study  a  coal-
to-liquids plant similar to the figure you are viewing, using the ma-
jority of coal with a smaller portion of biomass.

Now please turn your attention to the summary table on page 5.
The  top  row  shows  the  amount  of  greenhouse  gas  released  when
transportation  fuels  are  produced  from  Arabian  crude.  The  second
row shows the greenhouse gas emissions calculated by DOE NETL
for  a  hypothetical  coal-to-liquids  plant.  The  third  row  shows  the
greenhouse  gas  emissions  calculated  by  INL  for  the  Baard  energy
Ohio  project  before  any  controls  for  greenhouse  gas  emissions  are
implemented.  The  remaining  rows  show  various  levels  of  green-
house  gas  reduction  that  can  be  attained  by  implementing  carbon
capture  and  sequestration  and  by  co-feeding  only  30  percent  bio-
mass to the coal gasifier.

As  you  can  see  from  this  table,  it  is  possible  to  reduce  green-
house  gas  emissions  by  up  to  46  percent  below  comparable  crude
emissions when the coal-to-liquids plants are operated in this man-
ner.

I  wish  to  leave  you  with  three  factual  points  with  respect  to  the
exemplary  Baard  energy  plant  design.  First,  gasification  and  coal
and  biomass  plans  is  technically  feasible  and  commercially  proven
and available for use today. I have over 20 years of experience. My
Ph.D. is in gasification and combustion. I have performed research
in this area.

Second,  gasification  of  biomass  with  coal  is  the  technically  best
method  for  extracting  the  available  energy  from  carbon  from  the
biomass  to  produce  transportation  fuels  and  other  chemical  prod-
ucts.  I  repeat,  it  is  the  technically  best  method  for  extracting  the
energy and carbon from that biomass.

Third,  this  technology  is  ready  for  first-of-kind  facilities  in  the
United States, just as it is currently being applied in other nations.
Except that in America engineering, ingenuity, and the will to con-
trol  greenhouse  gas  emissions  can  provide  a  beacon  to  the  global
commons.

Let  us  turn  our  attention  to  the  concerns  about  water  that  has
been brought up. On Page 12 I present a drawing showing the de-
mand  and  discharges  of  water  for  a  representative  coal-to-liquids
plant.  A  large  amount  of  water  is  needed,  as  has  been  stated,  to
produce  hydrogen  and  to  provide  process  cooling  throughout  these
plants.  Evaporation  losses  in  the  cooling  tower  can  be  significant.
As  much  as  10  to  15  barrels  of  water  per  barrel  of  liquid  product
will  be  required  unless  standard  operating  practices  are  changed.
Gas to gas coolers and closed-loop heat recovery cycles can be de-
ployed to reduce the water demand to as little as three to five bar-
rels per barrel of liquid product. The technology exists. It is a mat-
ter  of  cost,  benefit  to  tradeoff,  and  a  will  to  implement  these
changes.

In my written testimony I will draw attention to the potential of
using  coal-bed  methane  wells-produced  water  to  supply  coal-to-liq-
uids plants. For example, I project the possibility of using coal-bed
methane  water  that  may  be  produced  in  the  Wyoming  Powder
River Basin to support the production of four million barrels of syn-
thetic  fuels  produced  over  a  50-year  period.  The  water  availability
may not be the barrier to start up of the first coal-to-liquids plants
or  those  that  are  built  and  replicated  thereafter.  It  may  simply  be
the  cost  benefit  tradeoffs  required  to  reduce  that  water  consump-
tion. Again, American ingenuity and engineering can help.

I  think  I  will  pass  by  my  comments  on  suggestions  for  research
that  could,  that  the  Federal  Government  could  support.  I  think
most  of  my  information  is  in  the  written  testimony,  and  a  lot  of
that has already been brought up.

In the interest of time I would like to just proceed to my conclu-
sions. I believe the U.S. can establish greater energy independence
using  hybrid  and  electrically-powered  cars,  as  been  suggested,
while  assuring  there  is  an  adequate  supply  of  diesel  and  jet  fuels
for,  please  understand,  aircraft,  shipping  vessels,  trains,  heavy  ve-
hicles,  and  machinery  that  currently  consumes  a  high  percentage
of the petroleum derived in fuels in the U.S.

A  balanced  portfolio  of  clean  energy  is  needed  inclusive  of  clean
coal conversion to electricity, chemicals, and transportation fuels. It
is  important  to  national  security  and  climate  control  that  clean
coal-to-liquids plants be constructed to establish the experience and
infrastructure necessary to establish this industry in the U.S.

Thank you for allowing me to speak.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RICHARD D. BOARDMAN

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  I  am  honored  to  be  invited  to
contribute to the discussion about the benefits and challenges of converting coal into
liquid transportation fuels by gasification followed by catalytic transformation of the
resulting  syngas  into  synthetic  diesel  and  other  petroleum-like  substitutes.  This
method  of  converting  coal  into  synthetic  fuels  is  often  referred  to  as  the  Fischer-
Tropsch process.
INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND

By  way  of  introduction,  I  am  a  senior  consulting  research  and  development  lead
for the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) where I have worked for the past 17 years.
My  project  assignments  have  covered  a  spectrum  of  fundamental  and  applied  re-
search  projects  in  nuclear  fuel  reprocessing,  radioactive  waste  cleanup,  pollutant
emissions  control,  clean  coal  technology  development,  and  gasification-based  tech-
nology  assessment,  development,  and  process  design.  Over  the  past  six  years,  my

66

research  efforts  have  primarily  focused  on  integrated  gasification  and  combined
cycle  power  generation,  and  process  modeling  of  Fischer-Tropsch  synthetic  fuels
plants.  I  am  currently  working  with  other  scientists  and  engineers  at  the  INL,  re-
gional universities, and private companies to develop gasification technology and as-
sociated  process  understanding  to  efficiently  convert  hydrogen  deficient  materials
(i.e.,  coal,  coke,  resid,  biomass,  and  other  opportunity  fuels)  into  clean  fuels,  sub-
stitute natural gas, electrical power, and chemicals such as ammonia. I am also the
Lead  for  the  INL  Energy  Security  Initiative,  aimed  at  increasing  the  Laboratory’s
capabilities  and  missions  in  developing  CLEAN,  SECURE,  ECONOMICAL,  and
SUSTAINABLE  energy  solutions  including  the  integration  of  the  next  generation
of  nuclear  reactors  to  assist  in  the  extraction  and  conversion  of  oil  shale,  oil  sands,
and coal to liquids.

I  have  served  as  an  adjunct  professor  at  the  University  of  Idaho  and  Brigham
Young  University,  providing  course  instruction  and  student  advise  in  combustion
processes,  air  pollutant  control,  and  nuclear  chemical  engineering.  I  support  Wyo-
ming  State  government’s  interest  to  better  understand  clean  coal  conversions  op-
tions, as well as private industry project development through DOE approved Work
for  Others  and  Cooperative  Research  and  Development  Agreements  with  the  INL.
I  am  an  officer  for  the  Idaho  Academy  of  Sciences  (IAS),  just  having  completed  a
customary  one-year  term  as  the  IAS  President.  I  organized  the  IAS  49th  Annual
Conference  held  this  past  April  with  the  theme  Energy  for  the  Future:  Environ-
mental and Ecological Considerations.

I  provide  this  personal  background  to  establish  a  perspective  for  the  views  that
follow. While all of us here today and others across the Nation will claim an interest
in  protecting  our  environment,  most  will  also  concur  that  we  have  come  to  appre-
ciate a sustained quality of life living at a comfortable temperature in decent dwell-
ings  with  adequate  mobility  to  reach  our  work  location  and  other  destinations  in  a
safe,  orderly,  and  efficient  manner.  We  also  have  come  to  depend  on  an  uninter-
rupted  and  diverse  supply  of  fresh  food  and  basic  consumer  commodities.  The  fact
is  that  the  basis  for  our  present  quality  of  life  is  realized  from  the  development  of
at  least  three  indispensable  energy-related  commodities:  First)  ammonia  based  fer-
tilizers; Second) electrical power; and Third) transportation fuels, which today is pri-
marily  derived  form  petroleum-derived  gasoline  and  diesel.  Global  demographics
and the quality of life are directly correlated to these three commodities, including,
but  not  limited  to  mass  production  and  distribution  of  food,  operation  of  machinery
that  enables  mass  production,  and  transit  of  these  products  to  consumers.  Remove
any  one  of  these  commodities,  and  life  as  it  is  appreciated  today,  both  here  and  in
developing nations will be dramatically halted. Add all of these commodities to sta-
ble  developing  nations,  and  the  standard  of  living  will  eventually  approach  that  of
the  United  States.  Thus,  we  should  all  be  concerned  about  the  potential  escalation
of  environmental  and  political  consequences  of  increased  energy  demand  and  pro-
duction around the globe.

All of us present here today are concerned with the compelling statistics regarding
the  imminent  peaking  of  oil  production  (estimated  by  most  to  occur  within  5–10
years).  Adding  to  this  concern,  there  is  a  simultaneous  increasing  demand  for  en-
ergy  and  transportation  fuels  by  China,  India,  and  many  other  nations.  Projected
population  in  India  and  China  alone  may  increase  from  around  2.3  billion  persons
(estimated  population  in  2003)  to  over  2.8  billion  in  2015.  The  per  capita  oil  con-
sumption  in  these  two  nations  in  2003  was  only  0.74  and  1.4  barrels  per  year  (bbl/
yr),  respectively.  In  comparison,  the  per  capita  consumption  in  the  United  States
was 25.6 bbl/yr, while it was 19.5, 15.2, and 5.3 bbl/yr in Canada, Japan, and Mex-
ico,  respectively.  It  is  possible  then,  and  many  credible  sources  predict,  that  the
global energy demand through 2050 will exceed ten times the equivalent oil reserves
of the concentrated oil triangle in the Middle East, where roughly 60 percent of the
remaining oil reserves are located. These combined facts underscore two potentially
significant  terrestrial  events  that  are  relevant  to  national  security  and  global  cli-
mate detriment. Clearly, I am referring to the increasing scarcity of oil and an esca-
lation  of  greenhouse  gases  attributed  to  unmitigated  release  of  carbon  dioxide.
These  two  problems  should  not  overshadow  the  ongoing  loss  of  industry  in  the
United  States,  including  fertilizer,  glass,  steel,  and  chemical  production  to  foreign
nations,  and  the  impact  on  national  security  and  economic  prosperity  when  U.S.
manufacturing and production further decline.

With  this  background  in  mind,  I  turn  your  attention  to  the  purpose  of  my  testi-
mony  today.  It  is  my  intention  to  address  the  importance  of  providing  immediate
incentives  to  advance  coal  and  biomass  conversion  to  liquid  transportation  fuels  in
an  environmentally  acceptable  manner.  I  will  address  solutions  that  are  being  pro-
posed and developed by the Idaho National Laboratory and industrial CRADA part-
ners to reduce both the projected life cycle release of greenhouse causing gases and

the  potential  demand  on  water  resources.  This  testimony  will  hopefully  convey  an
understanding that the technology basis and environmental solutions for coal-to-liq-
uids plants (CLT) are equally applicable to production of synthetic natural gas, am-
monia,  chemicals,  hydrogen,  and  electrical  power  from  coal  and  biomass  resources.
A holistic and balanced approach to resource utilization to achieve the optimum use
of our natural resources will therefore be suggested. This discussion will lead to rec-
ommendations on the role of federal research in achieving these goals.
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS PROJECTIONS

I  will  begin  my  technical  remarks  by  sharing  the  results  of  a  recent  technical
study  completed  by  the  Idaho  National  Laboratory  under  a  Cooperative  Research
and  Development  Agreement  with  Baard  Energy,  L.L.C.  Baard  Energy,  through  its
project company Ohio River Clean Fuels, L.L.C. (ORCF), is developing a coal gasifi-
cation Fischer-Tropsch synthetic fuels plant in Wellsville, Ohio. A process model for
the  project  has  been  developed  by  the  Idaho  National  Laboratory  to  assist  Baard
Energy with design and permitting activities. The model has been used to determine
operating conditions to capture and sequester byproduct carbon dioxide and to study
the  benefits  of  blending  biomass  with  coal  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emis-
sions.  A  life  cycle  GHG  emissions  assessment  based  on  the  model  results  for  the
ORCF  plant,  and  apportioned  to  the  product  mix  of  liquefied  petroleum  gas,  naph-
tha, diesel fuel, and power, indicates that a 30 percent reduction in GHG emissions
compared  to  life  cycle  GHG  emissions  for  transportation  fuels  produced  from  Ara-
bian  Crude  for  the  synthetic  diesel  fuel  is  achievable  when  biomass  fuel  is  blended
with the coal feeding the process and when concentrated CO2 is separated from the
syngas  feed  to  the  Fischer-Tropsch  reactors  and  used  or  sequestered.  When  credit
is  also  given  for  the  sale  of  surplus  electrical  power  generated  by  the  plant  (com-
pared  to  the  GHG  emissions  of  the  average  electrical  U.S.  power  mix),  the  ORCF
plant  will  further  reduce  GHG  emissions  approaching  50  percent  of  the  emissions
from  ultra-low  sulfur  diesels  derived  from  crude  oil.  Additionally,  other  plant  prod-
ucts, specifically the synthetic naphtha liquid produced by the Fischer-Tropsch proc-
ess  which  may  be  used  to  produce  additional  transportation  fuels  or  chemical  feed-
stock  such  as  ethylene,  can  also  reduce  GHG  emissions  compared  to  similar  petro-
leum-derived products.

The  results  of  the  Baard  Energy  study  are  being  presented  in  eight  days  at  the
24th  Annual  International  Pittsburgh  Coal  Conference  being  held  on  the  doormat
of  the  Sasol  Secunda  CTL  complex  in  Johannesburg,  South  Africa.  While  some  key
findings of the INL–Baard study are provided here today, I encourage you to review
this technical paper after it has been released with the Conference Proceedings.

The table below summarizes the life cycle emissions of greenhouse gases for CTL
transportation  fuels  on  the  basis  of  the  mileage  attained  by  a  standard  U.S.  utility
sports  vehicle  averaging  24.4  miles  per  gallon  when  operating  on  petroleum  diesel.

The INL–Baard study takes into account all greenhouse gas emissions associated
with fuels and feedstock input production and transportation to the CTL plant. The
study includes cases where woody biomass produced in the United States is blended
with the coal in the same manner that already has been proven technically feasible
in Europe at the Puertollano, Spain and the Buggenum, Netherlands integrated gas-
ification, combined cycle (IGCC) power plants. The study accounts for all greenhouse
gas  emissions  associated  with  conversion  of  the  fuels  into  syngas  and  subsequent
cleanup and conversion of the syngas into liquid fuels using the Fischer-Tropsch re-
action process and associated product upgrading and refining. Next, the study takes
into  account  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  associated  with  delivery  of  the  fuel  to
consumers  and  finally  the  consumption  of  the  fuel  in  a  standard  transportation  ve-
hicle.  This  study  emulates  the  work  performed  by  the  DOE  National  Energy  Tech-
nology  Laboratory  (NETL),  and  investigations  by  other  federal,  university  and  pri-
vate  organizations  to  assess  ‘‘well-to-wheel’’  greenhouse  gas  emissions  associated
with  various  transportation  fuels.  While  such  studies  invoke  specific  assumptions,
it should be noted that the majority of the greenhouse gas emissions are attributed
to the CTL plant and end-state combustion as illustrated in the figure that follows.

This INL–Baard life cycle greenhouse gas study corroborates the findings of other
organizations, but varies to the extent that the design of the CTL plant differs from
the  other  studies.  It  is  important  to  understand  there  can  be  significant  variation
in the CTL plant emissions depending on unit operation choices, the options selected
for the integration of heat and material recycle, and the decision to co-produce elec-
tricity  or  other  chemical  products.  I  hereby  state  without  reservation  that  green-
house gas emissions for coal-derived transportation fuels can be reduced by at least
20  percent  relative  to  petroleum  fuels.  The  INL–Baard  study  shows  that  a  30  per-
cent  reduction  may  be  possible  before  credit  is  taken  for  the  clean  power  produced
by  the  plant.  When  apportioned  credit  is  taken  for  the  green  power  co-produced  by
the plant, the GHG emissions reduction is estimated to be 46 percent as previously
indicated by Baard Energy in a press conference just last May. It is also important
to  state  that  these  reduced  levels  of  GHG  emissions  can  be  accomplished  using  ex-
isting technologies to concentrate and remove the CO2 produced by the process, and
by blending biomass with the coal feedstock.

Some important observations of the study include the following:

1. Almost 50 percent of the carbon fed to the CTL plant can be readily captured
and  sequestered  in  an  appropriate  geological  sink  or  it  may  be  used  for  en-
hanced oil recovery.

2. Approximately 30 percent of the carbon is incorporated in the liquid and gas-

eous fuels produced by the plant.

3. Approximately 15 percent of the carbon is converted to electrical power that
is used for the auxiliary load requirements in the plant while also producing
much needed clean electrical power.

4. Sequestration of the bulk CO2 produced and process efficiency improvements
can easily reduce life cycle GHG emissions from CTL transportation fuels to
a level comparable to fuels derived from crude oil.

5. Use of 30 percent biomass by weight achieves an apportioned reduction per-
centage  of  approximately  20–25  percent,  depending  on  the  choice  of  biomass
utilized  and  the  relative  carbon  content  and  moisture  levels  in  the  biomass.
6. The surplus electrical power produced by a CTL plant is neutral with respect
to  GHG  emissions  when  30  weight  percent  biomass  is  used  in  combination
with  CO2 sequestration  (please  refer  to  the  Pittsburgh  International  Coal
Conference paper for a detailed explanation).

In  addition  to  these  conclusions,  other  environmental  benefits  of  the  combination
of  coal  and  biomass  conversion  to  synthetic  fuels  using  the  gasification/Fischer-
Tropsch process include significantly reduced emissions of sulfur and other acid rain
and  ozone  pollutant  precursors  and  complete  control  of  mercury  and  other  toxic
metal  emissions.  Additionally,  it  can  be  shown  that  this  manner  of  converting  bio-
mass  to  liquid  fuels,  specifically  woody  biomass  as  well  as  most  herbaceous  mate-
rials,  is  a  much  more  efficient  method  of  converting  and  utilizing  the  chemical  po-
tential  of  biomass.  The  GHG  emissions  associated  with  indirect  conversion  of  bio-
mass  to  liquid  fuels  are  significantly  less  than  ethanol  fuels  derived  from  the  pop-
ular fermentation process.

Auto manufacturers in Europe and Japan are now producing hybrid cars that will
operate on diesel fuel and will attain higher fuel mileage than their gasoline-electric
driven  counterparts.  Therefore,  the  diesel  fuels  produced  in  the  manner  outlined  in
the  INL–Baard  study  will  further  reduce  greenhouse  gases  emitted  from  a  hybrid
vehicle. In other words, the greenhouse gas emissions are mainly due to the produc-
tion  of  the  fuels,  and  are  not  a  strong  function  of  type  of  fuel  used  in  the  hybrid
vehicle.
FEASIBILITY OF GASIFYING BIOMASS WITH COAL

Regarding  the  technical  feasibility  of  incorporating  biomass  with  the  coal  feed  in
a coal-to-liquids plant, coal gasification plants in Europe have demonstrated the via-
bility of operating commercial, high-pressure, entrained-flow gasifiers with blends of
biomass  for  sustained  periods  of  operation.  While  the  Baard  ORCF  project  is  based
on  gasifier  technology  that  has  successfully  operated  on  with  biomass  and  coal
blends, there are other options that can be used to incorporate biomass gasification
into  a  CTL  plant.  One  alternative  is  to  independently  inject  the  biomass  into  the
gasifer while simultaneously feeding coal through a separate nozzle. A second option
would  be  to  locate  a  set  of  gasifiers  designed  specifically  to  gasify  biomass  along
with  the  battery  of  conventional  entrained-flow  gasifiers  used  for  pulverized  coal.
Both  high-pressure  fluidized-bed  and  fixed-bed  biomass  gasifiers  are  commercially
proven  and  available.  This  option  opens  the  possibility  of  using  the  high  tempera-
ture  of  an  entrained-flow  coal  gasifiers  to  destroy  tars  and  oils  produced  at  lower
operating temperatures in the fluid-bed or fixed-bed biomass gasifiers.

Biomass  by  itself  can  be  difficult  to  gasify  due  to  its  high  moisture  content  and
other  physical  and  chemical  properties.  Biomass  gasifiers  inherently  produce  tars
and  oils  that  are  troublesome  to  convert  into  syngas  in  conventional  biomass  gasi-
fiers. Another problem can be the low melting point of the ash which can be difficult
to  manage.  Hence,  significant  attention  continues  to  be  directed  to  developing  effi-
cient  and  reliable  biomass  gasifiers.  However,  when  the  biomass  is  blended  with
coal and gasified in a high temperature slagging gasifier, the issue of tar formation
is  eliminated.  The  slag  produced  by  the  biomass  is  readily  incorporated  into  the
higher  mass  of  slag  produced  by  the  coal.  These  facts  underscore  the  benefits  of
gasifying  biomass  with  coal.  It  is  technically  the  best  method  of  converting  the  bio-
mass  to  syngas  and  subsequently  to  synthetic  fuels.  Additional  arguments  in  favor
of  co-gasifying  biomass  with  coal  are  beyond  the  scope  of  this  testimony,  but  can
be provided by any expert in gasification and thermal conversion processes.

Biomass  gasification  should  not  be  considered  a  barrier  to  current  project  plan-
ning  that  is  aimed  at  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  other  environmental
impacts.  However,  commercialization  and  testing  of  proven  and  emerging  biomass
gasifiers,  in  connection  with  testing  by  DOE  and  industry  of  dry  feed  pumps  and
advance  syngas  cleanup  technology  should  continue.  Improvement  of  biomass  feed-
stock collection, preparation, and delivery technology and infrastructure should also
be supported. This work will expand the possible uses of a wider variety of biomass,
and  will  increase  our  current  understanding  of  the  benefits  and  potential  impacts

of  biomass  gasification  on  refractory  life  and  syngas  cleanup  requirements,  for  ex-
ample. In conclusion, the feasibility of using biomass with coal can be resolved with
engineering, ingenuity, and the will to do so.

The  fact  that  biomass  itself  can  be  converted  to  liquid  fuels  begs  an  answer  to
the  supposition  that  the  U.S.  need  not  develop  its  coal  resources  to  produce  liquid
transportation fuels. The short explanation is that resource availability and econom-
ics do not support this assumption. In order to match the current U.S. consumption
of over 20 million barrels of oil per day, two-thirds of which is converted to transpor-
tation  fuels,  a  formidable  amount  of  biomass  would  be  required.  However,  a  ratio
of  30  percent  biomass  and  70  percent  coal  for  synthetic  fuels  is  much  more  plau-
sible.  For  additional  information,  I  refer  you  to  the  2005  ‘‘Hirsch  Report’’  that  dis-
cusses peaking of world oil production and its impacts and mitigation alternatives.1
The INL–Baard study of a notional 50,000 barrels per day synthetic liquids plant
would use approximately 8,000 to 9,000 tons per day of woody biomass at 15 percent
moisture content (harvested wood typically contains about 30–40 percent moisture).
This  material  will  need  to  be  collected,  dried,  and  ground  to  specifications  meeting
the  gasifier  feed  system  requirements.  I  cite  with  permission  an  example  of  a  U.S.
project  currently  under  construction  near  Selma,  Alabama  that  will  produce  dry
wood  pellets  containing  about  seven  percent  moisture.  This  project,  referred  to  as
the Dixie Pellet project, will use biomass gasifiers to produce hot gas and substitute
natural gas to produce pellets with minimum use of fossil-based energy. The excep-
tion  will  be  the  electricity  used  in  the  plant  which  will  be  purchased  from  a  local
utility  provider.  This  plant,  when  operated  at  capacity,  will  produce  upwards  of
1,500  tons/day  of  dry  wood  pellets  that  could  be  readily  shipped  to  a  coal-to-liquids
project.  Hence,  indications  are  that  five  to  six  comparable  plants  will  support  the
biomass required for one 50,000 barrels per day CTL plant using 30 wt. percent bio-
mass with 70 wt. percent coal. Whether the CTL plants purchase biomass collected
and assembled by plants such as the Dixie Pellet Plant, or whether they implement
in-line feed stock preparation is a matter of plant design choice and will depend on
the region where the plant is located and the variety of biomass available. Biomass
derived from switch grass, animal waste, and woody sources can all be gasified with
an appropriate choice of gasification technology.

Obviously,  it  will  not  be  economically  viable  for  all  plants,  especially  plants  lo-
cated in the high deserts of the upper Rocky Mountain States, to collect or transport
biomass  from  high  growth  regions  of  the  United  States.  Some  have  suggested  that
the overgrowth of western forests would be a reasonable source of biomass for west-
ern  plants.  It  is  likely  that  logistics,  economics,  and  environmental  impacts  of  col-
lecting dead or diseased timber for synthetic fuels production will rule out using this
potential  source  of  biomass  for  these  synthetic  fuels  projects.  However  projects  in
western states (as well as other states), may take advantage of any of the following
recommendations.

1. Begin with a plant design that maximizes the concentration, separation, and
capture  of  CO2.  Approximately  50  percent  carbon  capture  is  readily  attain-
able.

2. Implement  energy  saving  technology,  including,  but  not  limited  to  heat  re-
covery  cycles  that  can  utilize  the  low  grade  and  intermediate  grade  steam
that  is  produced  by  the  Fischer-Tropsch  reactors  and  integrated  unit  oper-
ations.

3. Consider  co-locating  the  CTL  plant  with  other  renewable  energy  providers
such as wind power turbines to offset the GHG emissions resulting from the
plant. In this manner, higher ratios of product recycle would be incorporated
into the plant while using a significant portion of ‘‘green’’ power for the plant
auxiliary loads.

4. Locate the CTL plant near the mine mouth, and where possible, in proximity
of existing refinery industry to minimize the greenhouse gas emissions asso-
ciated with transportation of the feedstock and plant products.

5. Select coal resources that are near the surface to minimize greenhouse gases
associated with coal-bed methane releases and resource production. Western
coal mines typically release significantly less CH4 and CO2 greenhouse gases
than eastern coal mines.

6. Consider biomass transportation costs and logistics when trains moving coal
to  energy  importing  states  in  the  East  and  Southeast  return  with  biomass
from high growth biomass regions.

Expanding  on  the  second  recommendation  on  this  list,  I  am  personally  aware  of,
and have technically reviewed one closed-loop heat recovery technology that is capa-
ble  of  recovering  and  converting  95  percent  of  the  energy  contained  in  the  copious
amount  of  low-grade  and  intermediate-grade  steam  produced  by  a  Fischer-Tropsch
plant into electrical power. These developing concepts take advantage of low boiling
point  fluids  that  can  condense  the  steam,  thus  eliminating  the  cooling  tower  loads
while  increasing  electrical  power  production  by  as  much  as  15–20  percent.  This  is
an  example  of  how  impetus  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  a  CTL  plant  will  spur  cre-
ative engineering aimed at designing more efficient and cleaner plants.
WATER RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

Let  us  now  turn  attention  to  water  consumption  concerns  associated  with  syn-
thetic fuels plants. In a recent workshop sponsored by the Gasification Technologies
Council,  I  presented  data  that  indicated  the  consumption  of  water  in  a  coal-to-liq-
uids plant could approach 15 barrels of water per barrel of liquids fuels product for
low  moisture  bituminous  coal,  and  12.5  barrels  of  water  per  barrel  of  liquid  fuels
for high moisture sub-bituminous coal. The basic problem is two-fold; first, coal does
not  contain  the  amount  of  hydrogen  that  is  required  for  synthetic  fuels  production,
and second, process cooling water and cooling tower evaporation rates in CTL plants
are significant.

Approximately five times the atomic ratio of carbon to hydrogen in coal is needed
to  produce  synthetic  natural  gas  (CH4)  while  approximately  2.5  times  this  ratio  is
needed  to  produce  liquid  fuels.  Water  (as  steam)  is  used  to  make  up  the  hydrogen
requirements. This is currently accomplished by shifting CO and water (H2O) to hy-
drogen (H2) and CO2. The Fischer-Tropsch process converts a portion of the syngas
to  water  (in  the  form  of  intermediate  pressure  stream)  while  producing  the  liquid
hydrocarbon  products.  The  general  plant  water  use  and  rejection  locations  and  dis-
charges are illustrated in the figure below.

In  summary,  process  makeup  water,  cooling  tower  evaporation,  and  dirty  process
water discharges (i.e., blowdown) can be significant. Hence, water demand is a con-
cern, especially in arid locations.

A  custom-design  heat  recovery  system  for  combined-cycle  power  generation  and
process  water  recovery,  treatment,  and  recycle  can  reduce  the  water  consumption
for  bituminous  coal-to-liquids  plants  from  15  to  10.5  barrels  of  water  per  barrel  of
liquid  hydrocarbon  product.  Combined  use  of  moist  biomass  with  coal  can  further
reduce  the  process  water  requirement  by  one-half  (1/2)  barrel  of  water  per  barrel

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:08 Apr 21, 2008 Jkt 037639 PO 00000 Frm 00075 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\090507\37639 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

72

of  liquid  product.  In  this  case,  the  plant  water  use  is  approximately  apportioned
among the following sinks:

• 1.75 barrels of water per barrel of liquid fuels for process requirements
• 6.0  barrels  of  water  per  barrel  of  liquid  fuels  for  cooling  tower  evaporation
• 2.25 barrels of water for cooling tower evaporation losses and blowdown asso-

losses and blowdown

ciated with surplus power generation

These  relative  figures  hopefully  contribute  to  the  understanding  of  the  water  re-
quirements for a CTL plant. Studies regarding water requirements vary widely, but
are generally consistent with the plant design and reporting basis. The most impor-
tant  point  to  capture  is  that  cooling  tower  losses  and  waste  water  blowdown  con-
stitute  the  majority  of  water  required  for  a  CTL  plant  (8.25  of  10  barrels  for  the
INL case study). In order to reduce the water duty, gas-to-gas heat exchangers could
for  used  for  steam  cooling.  Alternatively,  a  closed-loop  heat  recovery  system,  such
as  that  referred  to  previously  in  my  testimony,  would  eliminate  the  cooling  tower
and  water  evaporation  losses,  while  also  increasing  electrical  power  generation  by
15–20  percent.  Incorporation  of  a  closed-loop  heat  recovery  system  would  provide
the  joint  benefit  of  reducing  water  use  while  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions.
Thus, the water requirement can be reduced to as little as 3–5 barrels of water per
barrel of synthetic liquid product.

Another point to consider is the opportunity for CTL plants located near the coal
mine  to  use  coal-bed  methane  (CBM)  produced  water,  or  oil  field  water.  For  exam-
ple,  the  Wyoming  Coal  Gas  Commission  estimates  the  potential  water  production
from  nearly  24,000  wells  in  existence  in  the  Powder  River  Basin  could  yield  up-
wards of 15 billion barrels of water over approximately 30 years. The water quality
of a large portion of the PRB basin CBM water is adequate for direct use in a CTL
plant.  The  salinity  or  hardness  of  the  remainder  of  the  water  can  be  reduced  with
minimal water treatment, possibly comparable to the current cleanup requirements
for  much  of  the  surface  or  well-produced  waters  used  in  power  plants  throughout
the United States.

If  two-thirds  of  the  estimated  CBM  produced  water  in  Wyoming  were  used  for
CTL plants in conjunction with advance steam cooling technology, then there would
be  sufficient  water  to  produce  four  million  barrels  of  synthetic  fuels  per  year  over
a  50-year  period.2 This  is  equivalent  approximately  25–30  percent  of  the  transpor-
tation fuels currently consumed in the United States.
NEXUS OF CTL WITH NUCLEAR ENERGY

It is also worth noting is the possible nexus of coal and unconventional fuels pro-
duction  with  nuclear  energy.  With  the  electricity  produced  from  a  nuclear  reactor
it  is  possible  to  produce  oxygen  for  a  coal/biomass  gasifier  while  concurrently  pro-
ducing  hydrogen  for  the  Fischer-Tropsch  reactor.  Future  class  nuclear  reactors  will
also  have  the  capability  of  boosting  the  pressure  of  the  low-grade  and  intermediate
grade steam to levels amenable for electric power generation by a steam-driven elec-
trical  power  turbine-generator  set.  Consider  also  the  possibility  of  co-electrolyzing
CO2 with  water  inside  a  fuel-cell  operated  with  power  and  heat  produced  by  a  nu-
clear reactor. In this application, the CO2 and water would be converted to CO, H2,
and  O2—all  essential  inputs  to  coal  and  biomass  gasification  and  Fischer-Tropsch
synthetic  fuels  production.  Thus,  the  amount  of  carbon  incorporated  in  the  fuel
could theoretically exceed 95 percent. Other studies funded by AREVA using Powder
River  Basin  coal  as  the  feed  and  an  advanced  generation  nuclear  power  plant
showed that greater than 96 percent of the carbon in coal could be converted to liq-
uid fuels.
BENEFITS OF A HOLISTIC APPROACH

The preceding discussion supports the argument for a holistic approach to energy
and  transportation  fuel  development  that  is  protective  of  the  environment,  while
giving  adequate  attention  to  sustainable  and  secure  energy  for  the  Nation’s  future.
The urgency for clean energy need not come at the expense of national security. As
the Nation moves forward using biomass and other renewable energy resources, and
eventually with nuclear power and heat, it will be possible to again produce ammo-
nia  for  fertilizer,  chemical  feedstock  for  consumer  products,  industrial  gas  for  gas
and  steel  production  plants,  and  clean  hydrogen  for  electrical  power  production  (as
known  as  FutureGen),  hydrogen  for  sour  crude  and  unconventional  fossil  fuel  up-
grading, and last, but not least, secure transportation fuels for the next century and

2 (1,000,000,000 bbl-water)/(5 bbl water per bbl-fuel produced)/(50 years) = 4,000,000 bbls fuel/

yr for 50 years.

beyond.  This  can  be  done  while  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Failure  to  take
on this leadership will only transfer this responsibility to future generations and for-
eign nations that will continue to produce the products demanded without probable
control  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Failure  to  assume  this  leadership  will  also  re-
sult  in  economic  decline  and  increased  national  security  risk.  On  the  other  hand,
willingness  of  project  developers  and  environmental  protection  organizations  to  ac-
cept coal conversion with biomass blending and carbon management will enable the
U.S.  to  provide  solutions  to  our  global  commons,  while  assuring  secure,  clean,  effi-
cient, and sustainable domestic energy for the future.

Other  system  approaches  could  consider  the  use  of  high  pressure  CO2 slurries  to
transport western coal and CO2 to CTL plants and carbon sequestration sites in the
East, with a return line bringing water from the East to the arid West as practical.
The  reality  is  that  the  U.S.  is  not  short  on  viable  solutions  to  build  a  clean,  and
secure  CTL  industry.  Such  ideas  abound  within  the  Nation’s  research  academic  in-
stitutions  and  national  laboratories.  The  key  for  currently  developing  projects  is  to
implement  proven  technology  with  a  goal  of  reducing  greenhouse  gases  and  mini-
mizing  water  use.  This  recommendation  is  consistent  with  other  technical  experts
who  have  previously  testified  before  congressional  committees.  It  is  consistent  with
DOE  and  Department  of  Defense  objectives  to  establish  a  secure  domestic  supply
of  transportation  fuels  while  simultaneously  mitigating  global  climate  impact  con-
cerns.

I personally support efforts to convince the U.S. to conserve energy, while moving
to a new fleet of hybrid cars and electrically-driven commuter cars. I support accel-
erated development of wind and solar energy, as well ‘‘smart’’ deployment of nuclear
electrical power generation. I support a movement to develop biomass as a national
resource,  and  the  associated  deployment  of  a  system  to  improve  yield,  collection,
preparation, and transportation of this resource to points of efficient conversion into
energy  and  transportation  fuels.  However,  I  also  believe  the  pending  peaking  of  oil
production, as well as diminishing domestic reserves of natural gas, in parallel with
global  energy  demand  projections  and  the  acute  need  to  address  climate  change
point  to  the  urgency  for  the  United  States  to  begin  unprecedented  efforts  to  begin
building  plants  for  transportation  fuels  from  the  Nation’s  abundant  supply  of  coal
with biomass. It is both in the interest of national security as well as global environ-
mental  protection.  The  example  established  by  the  United  States  can  serve  as  a
model  for  other  countries  to  follow.  This  task  cannot  be  left  purely  to  the  market
place, since it is not presently the lowest cost method to produce electricity, natural
gas,  ammonia,  chemicals,  and  transportation  fuels.  It  is  for  these  reasons  that  ‘‘big
oil’’  is  not  currently  investing  in  the  development  and  construction  of  CTL  plants
in  the  United  States.  Therefore,  federal  incentives  to  move  to  a  synthetic  fuels  in-
dustry are necessary for timely market entry—in a manner that is protective of the
environment.  Establishing  necessary  greenhouse  gas  reduction  targets  will  impact
the economics and risk of the first U.S. plants; hence, assistance in the form of loan
guarantees  and  tax  advantages  will  help  establish  this  vital  industry  ahead  of  sig-
nificant economic incentives.
ROLE OF FEDERAL RESEARCH

In  my  opinion,  the  role  for  federal  research  is  to  press  forward  with  its  existing
programs  to  promote  commercial  development  of  clean  and  efficient  coal-to-liquids
plants.  Efforts  that  support  the  characterization  of  sites  for  CO2 sequestration
should be accelerated in order to provide technically acceptable options for the first
CTL  plants.  In  addition,  efforts  to  advance  biomass  gasification,  particularly  with
coal blends, will help expand the current set of commercially available options. On-
going  efforts  to  improve  and  expand  biomass  feedstock  collection  and  preparation
options, as well as high-pressure injection technology, are encouraged. Additionally,
federal research aimed at demonstrating emerging heat recovery options is advised.
Concepts  that  recovery  the  heat  from  low  grade  stream  to  help  reduce  water  con-
sumption while improving overall plant efficiency (thus further reducing greenhouse
gas emissions) should continue to be validated through appropriate technology dem-
onstrations supported by federal research funding.

Process  modeling  of  integrated  CTL  plants  should  also  continue.  These  studies
may  include  investigation  of  the  technical  feasibility  of  emerging  heat  recovery  op-
tions.  Process  modeling  can  be  complemented  with  academic  research  aimed  at  de-
veloping  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  fundamentals  of  Fischer-Tropsch  reactor
hydrodynamics and reaction processes. The benefit will be improved reactor designs
for  future  plants  and  computational  tools  to  help  optimize  operating  conditions  in
first-of-kind CTL plants in the U.S.

A  study  that  addresses  the  feasibility  of  collecting,  treating,  and  using  coal-bed
methane  produced  water  would  have  significant  ramifications  on  the  impact  of  es-

tablishing CTL plants in some western states. This potential benefit may also apply
in eastern and southern states. The study may also consider the use of this limited
water resource for biomass growth and reclamation of coal mine terrain.

Development  of  a  national  basis  for  estimating  greenhouse  gas  life  cycle  emis-
sions,  inclusive  of  potential  credits  for  co-generation  of  electrical  power  and  other
consumer  products  derived  from  a  CTL  plant  is  advisable.  An  acceptable  arbiter  of
carbon  emissions  and  credits  for  all  possible  energy  platforms  and  co-generation
plants will require careful and factual consideration of system interactions with the
environment.  The  comparative  INL–Baard  life  cycle  emissions  studies  are  consid-
ered  accurate,  but  leave  open  the  possibility  of  calculating  other  greenhouse  gas
emissions  benefits  associated  with  the  non-transportation  products  from  a  CTL
plant.  This  merely  points  to  the  interdependence  of  energy  with  other  consumer
products  and  not  strictly  the  transportation  sector.  Similar  consistent  calculation
methods should be developed for other energy conversion platforms.

Federal  research  covering  infrastructure  needs,  including  the  capability  of  manu-
facturing  and  transporting  gasifier  and  Fischer-Tropsch  reactor  vessels  to  CTL
projects  locations  is  advised.  One  of  the  most  significant  cost  and  schedule  impedi-
ments to establishing the CTL industry in the U.S. is the lack of heavy vessel man-
ufacturing  capability  throughout  the  world.  In  order  to  establish  greater  independ-
ence  from  foreign  controls,  the  U.S.  may  need  to  re-establish  this  capability.  A  so-
cial-economic  study  on  the  buildup  requirements  and  logistics  of  this  critical  infra-
structure component is recommended.

A  holistic  approach  to  deployment  of  CTL  plants  with  biomass  and  water  re-
sources, and nuclear assisted energy should be pursued as an out-reaching goal. Al-
though  this  should  not  impede  the  first  generation  of  CTL  plants,  such  an  outlook
will help ensure optimal use of our nation’s resources and environmental protection
for future generations. As the Nation expands this industry beyond the first genera-
tion of CTL plants, it will become increasingly important to consider overall system
performance.
CLOSING REMARKS

I  recommend  a  balanced  federal  focus  on  renewable  energy  and  development  of
the  Nation’s  coal.  Mass  deployment  of  ‘‘smart’’  hybrid  and  electrically  powered  cars
should be pursued in conjunction with the development of synthetic fuels from coal.
These  two  objectives  are  complementary  and  mutually  compatible.  In  this  manner,
the U.S. can establish greater energy independence, while assuring there is a proper
fuel choice for aircraft, shipping vessels, trains, heavy vehicles, and machinery that
currently  consume  a  high  percentage  of  the  petroleum-derived  fuels  in  the  U.S.—
namely  diesel  and  jet  fuels.  The  aims  of  environmental  protection  advocacy  groups
and the coal industry should not be viewed as being exclusive. A balanced portfolio
of  clean  energy  is  needed,  inclusive  of  coal  utilization  and  conversion  to  electricity,
chemicals, and transportation fuels. I believe it is possible to reverse greenhouse gas
emissions  when  considering  methods  to  reduce  the  greenhouse  gas  emitted  from
coal-derived  fuels  and  chemicals.  Incentives  to  encourage  clean  CTL  projects  are
therefore both important and necessary.

Federal  and  State  governments  can  help  build  the  supporting  infrastructure  nec-
essary  to  propagate  the  synthetic  fuels  industry  ahead  of  any  imminent  global  en-
ergy  crises.  Absent  from  my  testimony  today,  but  of  significance,  is  substantive  ar-
gument to establish domestic capability to supply the steel, manufacture the vessels,
and erect these plants before they become vitally necessary in a relative short time
frame. The Federal Government can focus attention on rebuilding these capabilities
by working with industry and equipment fabrication shops in various regions where
coal-to-liquids plants will be constructed. There is a need to continue to build liquid
product  and  CO2 pipelines,  while  providing  practical  and  acceptable  solutions  for
carbon management.

In  conclusion,  moving  forward  with  a  set  of  clean  CTL  plants  today,  and  the  re-
search  roles  identified  earlier,  responsible  infrastructure  can  be  established  to  help
ensure our nation’s energy and political security. Workforces can be trained and en-
gaged and economic prosperity sustained by industrial construction and plant oper-
ations  on  home  soil.  The  U.S.  can  provide  technical  leadership  to  other  nations
poised to utilize coal to meet their increasing energy demands.

WATER CONSUMPTION WITH COAL-TO-LIQUIDS PLANTS

Dr.  Boardman,  let  me  start  with  you.  In  your  written  testimony
you  state  that  a  coal-to-liquids  plant  could  produce  or  could  ap-
proach  15  barrels  of  water  per  barrel  of  liquid  fuel  product  from
low  moisture  bituminous  coal  and  twelve  and  one-half  barrels  of
water  per  barrel  of  liquid  fuels  for  high  moisture  sub-bituminous
coal. How does that water requirement compare to conventional pe-
troleum-derived motor fuel production now?

Dr.  BOARDMAN.  I  am  not  sure  that  I  can  give  you  an  exact  an-
swer, but, again, these plants require hydrogen. Carbon is deficient
to that hydrogen, and so you need water, at least a barrel of water
to  make  up  the  hydrogen  needed  to  formulate  the  synthetic  fuels.
The  majority  of  the  water,  Mr.  Chairman,  is  actually  consumed  in
the  cooling  towers  that  are  used  to  cool  the  intermediate  and  low-
pressure  steam.  And  so  in  that  part  of  the  plant  by  that  evapo-
rative  process  of  those  cooling  towers  you  lose  copious  amounts  of
this water.

Chairman LAMPSON. Some strategies to change that?
Dr.  BOARDMAN.  Yes.  That  is  where  the  need  to  upgrade  the
plants to these gas-to-gas heat exchangers then which would elimi-
nate the duty on those cooling towers. Also, as we progress forward
to  look  at  these  closed-cycle  heat  recovery  loops  that  many  are
working on in the United States, that will also help.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  And  is  there  a  role  for  federal  research  to

help insure that those strategies become effective?

Dr. BOARDMAN. Yes. In that particular area I think a demonstra-
tion  of  some  of  these  closed-loop  heat  recovery  cycles  is  rec-
ommended.

CO2 EMISSIONS

Chairman LAMPSON. Okay. For both you and Dr. Bartis, you dis-
cussed  the  possibility  of  reducing  CO2 emissions  when  biomass  is
blended with the coal during the liquid fuel process, and then, and
when  concentrated  CO2 is  separated  from  the  syngas  feed  and  se-
questered,  what  are  the  technical  challenges  with  combining  coal
and biomass in order to achieve a significant CO2 reduction target?
Do  you  want  to  start  or  Dr.  Bartis,  you  start,  and  then  we  will

go to Dr. Boardman.

Mr.  BARTIS.  The  gasification  takes  place  at  15  atmospheres  of
pressure  or  so.  So  the  challenge  is  getting  biomass  into  that  gasi-
fier  and  going  through  that  pressure  change.  And  then  once  it  is
in the gasifier, you want to make sure that it doesn’t interfere with
the internal workings of a gasifier that has been designed for some-
thing else. So I think it is a pretty straightforward process that we
have here. I mean, this is not science. It is technology and testing,
but  I  think  we  need  a  few  test  rigs  built,  designed  and  built,  and
we need to make sure that this system works.

We  are  handling  solids,  and  whenever  you  handle  solids,  you
have  tremendous  uncertainties.  It  is  very  hard  to  scale  up,  so  the
only  way  to  make  this  technology  truly  commercial  is  to  test  it  at
some scale.

Now,  there  is  some  experience  in  the  Netherlands  on  using  bio-
mass  for  gasification,  but  it  turns  out  these  are  very  small

amounts, and they are very special forms of biomass. They are not
biomass  types  that  typically  would  be  found  in  the  United  States.
So  I  think  there  is  a  real  opportunity  here  to  do  something  on

a very short timescale.

ROLE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

Chairman LAMPSON. Okay. So, again, is there a role for the Fed-

eral Government to plug in?

Mr. BARTIS. I think there are lots of uncertainties with regard to
the  future  of  coal-to-liquids  in  the  United  States,  and  I  just  don’t
see the private sector coming up with a lot of its own funds to move
this  technology  forward.  So  I  think  there  is  a  role  for  the  Govern-
ment.

Chairman LAMPSON. Do you want to make a quick comment, Dr.

Boardman?

Dr. BOARDMAN. Well, I concur, for feed injection high pressure is
certainly  an  issue  that  can  be  further  developed  and  improved,
springing from the experience in Europe, but I might also mention
that  when  we  talk  about  biomass  and  coal  gasification,  sometimes
we think that has to be done in the same gasifier. It is entirely fea-
sible  to  do  them  in  two  separate  gasifiers.  These  coal-to-liquid
plants will require a battery of gasifiers. So it is possible to use al-
ready  existing  and  proven  biomass  gasification  technology,  both  in
Europe  and  developing  in  the  U.S.,  to  gasify  the  biomass  and  the
coal in two separate reactors, combining that syngas.

But,  again,  I  think  those  dry  feed  systems  is  probably  the  area

where research focus could mainly be put.

CAN WE USE THE HYDROGEN EXTRACTED FROM THIS

PROCESS?

Chairman  LAMPSON.  If  I  continue  with  my  questions  the  way  I
am  going,  I  am  going  to  run  out  of  time.  So  let  me  digress  from
what I intended to do and just ask a question that came up yester-
day  in  some  discussions  with  staff  on  this.  And  the  process  which
I am trying to understand and I do not, I am told that a significant
amount  of  hydrogen  is  separated  from  this,  and  if  that  is  the  case
early  in  the  process,  why  don’t  we  just  take  the  hydrogen  and  in-
stead  of  taking  it  all  the  way  through  this  entire  process  to  make
a  different  kind  of  fuel,  why  don’t  we  use  it  when  we  are  trying
to  build  this  infrastructure  necessary  to  start  to  distribute?  Can
someone comment on that for me?

Dr. BOARDMAN. May I take a shot at that?
Chairman LAMPSON. Please. Yes.
Dr.  BOARDMAN.  Well,  certainly,  you  know,  we  have  looked  at  a
hydrogen economy, and hydrogen of itself is very difficult to trans-
port about. It is, you know, a very light molecule.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Well,  would  it  be  better  for  us  to  put  our
money  into  the  research  to  help  solve  that  problem  than  the  re-
search  to  take  this  through  all  these  different  stages  to  get  to
where we are going?

Dr.  BOARDMAN.  I  think  the  hydrogen  economy  is  well  in  the  fu-
ture. I think that the coal-to-liquids plants are a bridge to that fu-

ture,  and  I  think  the  liquid  transportation  fuels,  as  well  as  syn-
thetic  natural  gas,  are  very  convenient  carriers  of  that  hydrogen.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much.
Mr. Inglis.

COAL-TO-LIQUIDS VERSUS PETROLEUM

Mr.  INGLIS.  I  said  to  the  Chairman,  bingo.  It  seems  to  me  that
is quite the question is why invest in something that really is sort
of  like,  well,  I  think  when  we  are  comparing  coal-to-liquids  to  pe-
troleum,  we  are  really  comparing  Pintos  and  Vegas.  Anybody  re-
member  a  Pinto  and  a  Vega?  Some  of  the  staff  back  here  is  too
young  to  remember.  Well,  a  Vega,  my  family  had  three  of  them.
They  had  aluminum  blocks  or  something.  They  fell  apart  after
awhile.  They  were  maybe—the  Vega  may  have  been  better  than
the  Pinto  or  the  Pinto  better  than  the  Vega,  but  really,  when  you
are comparing coal-to-liquid and run it in a car, compared to petro-
leum,  are  we  really  talking  about  that  kind  of  comparison  rather
than  a  really  elegant  solution  that  the  Chairman  was  just  talking
to?

You  figure  a  way  to  get  that  hydrogen  into  that  car.  The  only
emission is water out of the back of the car. Right? You don’t have
this,  Dr.  Bartis  mentioned  we  can  deal  with  the  national  security
issue,  and  I  think  that  is  correct.  It  seems  to  me  if  we  used  our
own  coal,  we  are  clearing  dealing  with  the  national  security.  We
are not getting all the way, which is also fixing the environmental
challenge.

So the thing that I found interesting about testimony from Dr.—
let  us  see,  Dr.  Romm  said  and  it  will  be  interesting  to  hear  Mr.
Ward’s  response  to  this,  that  a  carbon  trading  system  would  wipe
out coal-to-liquids, destroy the economics of it. Is that correct?

Mr.  WARD.  Not  in  our  view  because,  again,  the  thing  you  have
to, I think you had it right with the Pinto and the Vega. You know,
we  are  not  talking  about  coal-to-liquids  being  something  that  com-
petes with hydrogen that is some number of decades in the future.
We are talking about reducing our dependence on imported oil with
a  similar  thing.  So  I  would  look  at  it  from  the  perspective  of  the
Pinto, I have to build and protect the system for protecting my im-
ported oil resources, while the Vega is something that I can do here
at home while we are working on whatever vehicle we want for the
future.

As  far  as  your  direct  question  on  the  carbon  trading  goes,  the
products  are  commodities.  We  are  not  talking  about  a  new  kind  of
fuel.  These  products  will  compete  against  the  oil-derived  products
in  an  open  market,  and  our  analysis  shows  that  as  long  as  oil
prices remain above a certain level, $50 a ton or whatever, the im-
pact of that carbon will, the carbon tax or whatever carbon regula-
tion scheme will come into place, will wash out in that process. So
we—I don’t see it as a definite at all.

Mr.  INGLIS.  And  Dr.  Freerks  had  a  comment  about  reducing  the
risk  of  price  fluctuations.  What  would  you  recommend  by  way  of
strategies to reduce that price fluctuation?

Dr.  FREERKS.  My  concern  is  that  if  crude  oil  drops  precipitously,
it  will  wipe  out  the  economic  benefits  of  building  CTL  plants,  and
I  think  the  economic  value  for  CTL  plants  is  in  the  45  to  $50  per

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:08 Apr 21, 2008 Jkt 037639 PO 00000 Frm 00081 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\090507\37639 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

barrel  range.  So  we  can  make  those  plants  pay  back  their  loans
and  give  the  investors  a  good  return  at  a  reasonable  price  for
crude. But we need price stability and a collar on the lower end of
that  price  in  order  to  get  the  investors  to  be  willing  to  put  money
into those plants.

Mr. INGLIS. Are you telling me a floor on prices, a floor on crude

oil prices?

Dr. FREERKS. Yes.
Mr. INGLIS. Is that what you are talking about?
Dr.  FREERKS.  Just  a  guarantee  that  the  prices  will  not  drop
below  a  certain  level,  which  will  just  insure  the  economic  viability
of these plants’ future, and we are not then dependent upon foreign
sources of crude to fuel our economy and protect our——

COAL PRODUCTION

Mr. INGLIS. Dr. Hawkins, you had some different numbers in an
MIT study that was mentioned in the charter for this hearing. You
said that, MIT apparently says that switching or to replace 10 per-
cent of the fuel consumption they say, I think it was your number,
too,  10  percent.  They  say  that  it  takes,  it  would  take  250  million
tons of coal per year. You said, I think, 470 million tons. They say
it  would  require  a  25  percent  increase  in  our  current  coal  produc-
tion.  You  said  a  43  percent.  You  are  disagreeing  with  the  MIT
study I guess?

Mr.  HAWKINS.  My  numbers  are  taken  from  the  National  Coal
Council report, and they are aimed at a target of 10 percent reduc-
tion  in  the  year  2025,  forecasted  oil  consumption,  which  is  larger
than  today’s  oil  consumption.  So  you  have  two  numbers;  one,  the
larger  amount  of  oil  consumption  in  2025,  which  is  about  the  ear-
liest  that  you  would  expect  this  industry  to  get  spun  up  to  a  size
where it could conceivably make that kind of a dent and using the
technology efficiency numbers that the National Coal Council used.
I don’t know what efficiency numbers MIT used.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Mr.  McNerney,  you  are  recognized  for  five

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thanks  panel  mem-
bers for coming this morning. This is a set of very interesting testi-
mony,  and  there  is  a  lot  of  disagreement  I  see  between  the  panel
members.

Dr. Bartis and Mr. Hawkins both mentioned what I think is the
very  fundamental  quandary  that  we  are  facing;  how  do  we  reduce
our  dependence  on  imported  oil  while  reducing  the  production  of
greenhouse  gases,  and  our  national  security  depends  on  this,  our
economy  depends  on  this,  the  environment.  It  is  a  very  difficult,
complicated  question.  So  I  appreciate  the  time  and  effort  that  you
are putting into it.

It  is  important  to  be  open-minded  about  CTL,  but  I  have  grave
concerns,  especially  for  surface  mode  of  transportation.  Air  trans-
portation may be a little bit more interesting, but for surface mode
I think we have grave problems.

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS—COST AND VIABILITY

My  question,  the  first  question  is  Dr.  Freerks,  there  are  two
issues  I  would  like  you  to  address;  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions,
the  cost  and  viability.  In  my  mind  I  don’t  see  any  basis  for  what
it is going to cost to sequester greenhouse gases, and also, the tech-
nical  viability  of  that  process.  Is  it  safe?  We  don’t  know  too  much
about that yet, so building an industry, assuming that that is going
to be a good process, it is very, very risky.

The other question is something that has been brought up, water
usage.  How  do  you  see  that  playing  out  in  the  long  run?  Water  is
going to be even more valuable than oil. It already is in some situa-
tions.  So  both  in  terms  of  usage  and  in  terms  of  pollution,  when
the coal is mined.

Dr.  FREERKS.  Let  us  first  start  with  carbon  capture  and  seques-
tration. The coal-to-liquids process inherently captures CO2 in sev-
eral  places  in  the  plant.  We  gasify  coal,  and  we  capture  the  CO2
from  that  gasification  process.  We  run  the  synthesis  gas,  carbon
monoxide  and  hydrogen,  through  a  Fischer-Tropsch  reactor,  which
in our case produces more CO2 while shifting the carbon monoxide
to  hydrogen.  And  we  capture  CO2 from  that  part,  too.  So  we  can
capture CO2 quite readily in our plants with no additional cost be-
cause the equipment is there for other reasons.

Now,  the  sequestration  part  of  that  is  a  separate  question,  and
we  have  addressed  that  in  our  Natchez  plant  by  teaming  up  with
Denbury  Pipeline,  who  is  moving  CO2 from  natural  sources  right
now to oil fields for enhanced oil recovery. And the amount of CO2
that we produce is equivalent to roughly one barrel of crude oil pro-
duced  for  every  barrel  of  F–T  produced.  And  although  people  may
argue that that does not net decrease the greenhouse gas emissions
because  you  are  just  trading  CO2 put  into  the  ground  for  fuel
brought  up,  it  does  increase  our  energy  security,  and  we  are  going
to burn that fuel anyways whether we burn it from imported crude
or  we  make  the  crude  here.  It  just  changes  where  we  are  going  to
pay for that crude. So it is probably better to use our own domestic
resources  than  it  is  to  produce  external  resources  and  bring  them
in.

WATER USAGE

The other question you had was on what? The water use?
Mr. MCNERNEY. Water usage.
Dr.  FREERKS.  Okay.  In  the  Natchez  plant  we  have  Mississippi
River  water  for  cooling,  so  water  use  is  not  an  issue  in  that  plant.
We have looked at designs for plants that are capable of being put
in  dry  climates  like  Wyoming,  and  they  actually  will  not  use  any
more water than they produce. When you produce a barrel of crude
oil with the Fischer-Tropsch process, you produce a barrel of water,
and that water can be condensed and recycled through the process,
and  you  have  no  net  usage  of  water.  And  that  is  an  engineering
design.

Mr. MCNERNEY. So you are saying that you use a barrel of water
in  the  process  and  then  you  produce  a  barrel  of  water  at  the  end
of the process? Is that what you are saying?

80

Dr.  FREERKS.  You  can  design  the  plant  such  that  you  are  net
neutral  on  water.  It  is  an  engineering  issue.  It  is  a  cost  issue,  but
it can be done.

Mr. MCNERNEY. That seems farfetched to me.

LIMITATIONS OF DOMESTIC COAL RESOURCES

Mr.  Ward,  you  have  referred  to  abundant  coal  resources,  and  if
we  move  forward  with  coal-to-liquid  displacement  of  petroleum  for
surface transportation, what limitations do you see on the domestic
coal resource? This was an issue that was brought up by one of the
other panelists. What limitations are there?

Mr.  WARD.  There  have  been  two  studies  completed  in  the  last
year, one by the Southern States Energy Board and one by the Na-
tional  Coal  Council,  but  both  took  a  hard  look  at  the  availability
of  coal,  and  both  determined  that  our  coal  resources  in  the  United
States  are  more  than  adequate  to  accomplish  this  kind  of  a  scale
up  and  use  the  coal  resources  for  transportation  uses  in  addition
to electricity generation.

CTL WASTE

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  We  will  have  to  study  those  reports.  And  you
also  talked  about  CTL  being  a  clean  resource,  and  while  the  end
product  is  clean,  clearly,  it  looks  clean  anyway.  I  didn’t  open  it  up
and smell it, but I didn’t want to get it on my suit. But how much
waste  is  produced  in  producing  a  barrel  of  liquid,  and  how  toxic  is
the  waste?  And  what  do  you  do  with  it,  not  even  considering  the
carbon dioxide?

Mr. WARD. Well, I am going to defer to one of the scientists with
us,  but  the  waste  products  from  a  coal-to-liquids  plant  are  very
similar to what you would see in an oil refinery.

Dr. BOARDMAN. If you would like me to answer that.
Mr.  WARD.  You  have  got  a  gasification  slag  product,  which  is  a
solid  product,  which  is  also  very  similar  to  the  coal  combustion
products you have from a coal-fueled power plant, the residual sol-
ids. They are non-hazard. They are classified non-hazardous waste
in this country.

Dr.  BOARDMAN.  Having  been  involved  in  the  intimate  details  of
such  a  design  and  seeing  one  on  the  Baard  Energy  Project,  I  can
comment  to  that.  It  is  the  ash  product  coming  from  the  coal  and
the  biomass  that  might  be  used.  There  will  be  some  air  emissions
discharges.  Those  will  be  relatively  clean  because  this  process
takes out all of the toxic metals in that coal, the mercury, arsenic,
and other things, as well as a lot of the unburned hydrocarbon. So
you  basically  are  generating  some  power  in  that  plant,  but  it  is  a
combined  cycle  power,  very  clean  on  that  discharge  point.  It  does
have some CO2 in it that is opportune to remove in the future, but
apart  from  that  the  water  discharge  also  needs  to  be  cleaned  up
but conventional technology exists to do that.

So on that basis it is, again, comparable to a pulverized coal-fired

power plant that has to clean up its water discharges.

Chairman LAMPSON. Dr. Bartlett, five minutes.

PLUG-IN HYBRIDS

Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you very much.
There  is  an  article  recently  that  said  that  our  usual  250  years
projection  of  coal  use  might  more  appropriately  be  just  100  years.
That  is  probably  because  at  current  use  rates,  they  are  just  pro-
jecting  from  our  current  use,  and  we  are  really  increasing  our  use
of  coal  a  bit  over  two  percent  a  year.  If,  by  the  way,  you  increase
the  use  of  something  just  five  percent  a  year,  that  doubles  in  14
years,  it  is  four  times  bigger  in  28  years,  it  is  eight  times  bigger
in 42 years, and it is 16 times bigger in 56 years.

So  if,  in  fact,  we  have  100  years  of  coal  at  our  present  rate  of
increase  in  the  use  of  coal,  if  we  increase  its  use  just  five  percent,
I  think  that  would  be  a  low  figure  if  we  are  going  to  make  any
meaningful impact, then it is, we are going to run out of coal pretty
darn quickly, aren’t we?

You  mentioned  the  evaporation  of  water  and  how  much  water  it
took,  that  is  really  double  sin,  isn’t  it?  You  are  using  precious
water,  and  it  takes  a  lot  of  energy  to  do  that.  You  are  wasting  a
lot of heat doing that. When the President said we were hooked on
oil,  he  was  exactly  right.  We  are  so  hooked  on  oil  that  we  become
irrational when we are talking about alterative energy uses.

You  know,  we  were  talking  about  hydrogen.  Why  don’t  we  just
use the hydrogen? Well, you always use more energy producing hy-
drogen than you get out of it. Why wouldn’t you just go back to the
original energy source and use that? If you are talking about using
coal,  why  don’t  you  just  burn  the  coal?  There  is  no  better  way  to
get  energy  out  of  almost  any  product  than  simply  to  burn  it.  And
if you are doing that where you can use the excess heat instead of
stupidly  evaporating  precious  water,  then  you  have  a  double  in-
crease in the efficiency.

Am  I  wrong?  Doesn’t  it  make  any—by  the  way,  and  if  you  want
to  get  a  lot  of  duration  from  your  plug-in  hybrid,  instead  of  stop-
ping  to  refuel  your  car,  simply  stop  to  switch  batteries.  And  you
can  now  drive  an  infinite  distance  with  a  plug-in  hybrid,  can  you
not?

If  I  am  not  wrong  in  all  of  this,  does  it  make  any  sense  to  talk
about coal-to-liquids? Why don’t we just burn the coal and produce
electricity and use plug-in hybrids?

Mr. HAWKINS. Well, I would agree 100 percent with that. I mean,
I  think,  you  know,  electric  motors  are  very  efficient,  so  if  you  can
generate  electricity,  you  can  use  it  very  efficiently,  and  I  think
plug-in  hybrids  are  the  vehicle  of  the  future.  I  think  there  is  no
question that if you take the coal and burn it in a gasification plant
and  capture  the  carbon  and  store  it,  you  would  actually  have  car-
bon-free  electricity.  So  you  would  be  running  your  car  on  carbon-
free electricity. If you do CTL, if you do liquid coal with carbon cap-
ture and storage, you are still running your car on diesel fuel. You
have  not  solved  the  global  warming  problem  at  all,  but  you  have
spent a bundle of money to get you nowhere.

So I couldn’t agree with you more.
Dr.  BOARDMAN.  Except  that  when  you  burn  that  coal  in  those
power plants, you need the same water to cool that steam that you
make. The process——

Mr.  BARTLETT.  I  would  use  that  for  district  heat.  All  over  the
world  they  place  their  power  production  plants  where  there  are
people  so  that  they  can  use  the  excess  heat  for  what  is  called  dis-
trict  heating.  In  the  summertime  you  can  simply  use  an  ammonia
cycle,  refrigeration  and  cool  your  homes  with  this  excess  heat.
What  we  do  is  really  dumb,  and  we  need  to  stop  doing  it,  do  we
not?

Dr.  BOARDMAN.  Yes,  and  that  same  steam,  though,  could  be
taken off that coal-to-liquids plant and used the same way. It is the
exact same steam, it is the exact same quality of heat.

Dr.  HAWKINS.  If  I  could  just  add  a  word  about  the  elephant  in
the  room  and  that  is  energy  efficiency,  this  is  the  long  pole  in  the
tent  if  you  are  worried  about  oil  dependence  and  global  warming.
We  can  back  out  more  oil  with  smarter  cars,  smarter  transpor-
tation  systems.  We  can  back  out  more  global  warming  emissions
with  that,  and  we  can  give  Americans  increased  choice,  vehicles—
people  don’t  buy  vehicles  because  they  burn  lots  of  gasoline.  They
buy  them  for  the  services  they  provide,  and  if  we  have  intelligent
policies  that  are  designed  to  deliver  vehicles  that  people  want  to
drive,  we  don’t  need  price  supports  for  minimum  prices  of  oil.
Those  vehicles  are  going  to  provide  value  to  American  consumers
whatever the price of oil is.

Mr.  WARD.  I  would  just  agree.  I  would  agree  entirely  that  plug-
in  hybrid  vehicles  are  a  place  we  need  to  go.  The  energy  efficiency
is  a  place  we  need  to  go.  Coal-to-liquids  is  a  bridge  technology.  It
is not the ultimate technology. The problem with plug-in hybrid ve-
hicles is we have got to make millions of them and convince people
to  buy  them  and  use  them.  There  are  no  plug-in  hybrid  airplanes,
there are no plug-in hybrid locomotives, there are no plug-in hybrid
big  yellow  machines  that  build  things  and  long-haul  trucks  and
those  kind  of  things.  We  will  continue  to  use  liquid  fuels  for  those
types of things.

And  one  other  clarification  on  the  brief  discussion  on  price  sup-
ports  for  deployment  of  coal-to-liquids  facilities,  I  don’t  think  any-
one  in  the  industry  is  looking  for  that  as  a  permanent  solution.
When  we  talk  about  commercialization  incentives,  we  have  a  com-
mercialization gap where we need to convince Wall Street that the
first  few  of  these  plants  can  be  built.  So  when  you  are  looking  at
some  sort  of  a  mechanism  to  insure  against  price  volatility  in  oil
markets, you are only looking at that for the limited purpose of the
first  few  coal-to-liquids  plants  so  that  you  can  get  this  industry
kick  started.  And  after  that,  let  the  industry  compete  against  oil
resources  and  others  to  fill  that  continuing  demand  we  are  going
to have for liquid fuels while we wait for efficiency and plug-in hy-
brids to take hold.

Mr. BARTLETT. What you are saying about trucks and trains and
airplanes  is,  particularly  for  airplanes  is  exactly  true.  They  have
got  to  have  a  liquid  fuel.  But  a  large  part  of  the  liquid  fuels  we
use  are  in  automobiles,  and  we  can  do  something  about  that,  can
we not?

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Dr. Bartlett.
And now, Mr. Costello, five minutes.

Mr. COSTELLO. Mr. Chairman, thank you, and thank you for call-

ing this hearing today.

RUNNING AIRCRAFT ENGINES ON COAL-TO-LIQUIDS

Mr.  Ward,  I  appreciate  you  making  the  comment  that  there  are
airplanes  and  locomotives  and  other  road-building  equipment  and
other  vehicles  that  have  to  run  on  liquid  fuel.  Both  you  and  Dr.
Freerks  made  the  point  that  the  Department  of  Defense  has  been
a  leader  in  moving  to  clean  coal  technology  and  also  to  coal-to-liq-
uids. And there has been some discussion, I think, and some skep-
tics  in  the  past  saying,  do  you  have  to  modify  aircraft  engines  in
order to run them on coal-to-liquids.

And  Mr.  Ward,  I  think  I  heard  you  say  earlier  that  one  is  that
CTL  is  not  a  new  kind  of  fuel,  and  two,  is  that  you  do  not  have
to modify existing engines to run them on CTL. Is that correct?

Mr.  WARD.  That  is  correct.  You  are  making  gasoline,  diesel  fuel,
jet fuel. Those fuels can be used directly, they can be blended with
petroleum-derived  fuels,  they  can  be  distributed  in  existing  pipe-
lines  and  service  stations.  You  know,  this  is—and  that  is  no  small
issue. When you look at new types of fuels coming into play for the
United States, you are also going to not only build the vehicles that
run on those fuels, you are going to have to build the delivery sys-
tems  for  getting  those  fuels  to  market.  Ask  anyone  who  tries  to
drive  E–85  in  lots  of  states  in  this  country,  you  know,  where  they
can find those things.

One  of  the  advantages  to  CTL  as  a  bridge  technology  is  we  can
put  it  into  the  existing  pipelines,  the  existing  vehicles,  and  reduce
our dependence on imported oil right now.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  So  for  those  who  have  questioned  do  you  have  to
modify,  does  DOD  have  to  modify  the  engines,  they  do  not?  Jet
Blue  and  some  of  the  other  airlines  are  looking  at  CTL.  Dr.
Freerks, it looks like you want to make a comment here.

Dr.  FREERKS.  I  have  been  involved  with  the  development  of  the
F–T fuel with the Department of Defense for about eight years, and
the  only  concern  that  they  really  have  is  that  they  have  not  seen
this  fuel  in  their  engines  before,  so  they  are  testing  to  make  sure
that  it  does  work.  And  so  far  all  the  tests  show  that  there  is  no
modification  needed,  other  than  that  you  can  get  more  efficiency
out of the fuel if you design the engine to actually run on that fuel.
We  can  run  it  on  the  existing  engines,  but  we  can  actually  do  bet-
ter, and even NASA is looking at designing spacecraft to run on the
F–T  fuels  because  it  provides  a  cleaner  way  to  get  into  space  than
many of the other alternative fuels that they have been using.

So  there  are  many  advantages  to  this  fuel.  It  is  not  only  just  a
replacement  for  conventional  fuels.  It  is  an  enabling  fuel  for  both
the  turban  engine  and  the  diesel  combustion  engine  where  we  can
design the engines to be both more efficient and lower polluting be-
cause the fuel itself burns so much cleaner than conventional fuels
which contain aromatics and sulfur.

Mr. COSTELLO. And it is my understanding that the Department
of  Defense,  the  Air  Force  in  particular,  has  just  certified  a  CTL
blend to be used for the B–52?

Dr. FREERKS. Correct.

84

Mr. COSTELLO. And that just took place just a few weeks ago. Is

that correct?

Dr. FREERKS. Correct.

CARBON SEQUESTRATION

Mr.  COSTELLO.  Mr.  Hawkins,  my  understanding  from  your  testi-
mony  is  that  you  indicate  that  carbon  sequestration  makes  sense
for  coal  electricity  generation  but  not  for  CTL.  I  wonder  what  you
believe are the appropriate federal initiatives for developing the se-
questration used for electricity production.

Mr. HAWKINS. Thank you, Mr. Costello. Actually, we believe that
carbon  sequestration  or  carbon  capture  and  storage  makes  sense
for  any  use  of  coal.  What  we  question  is  using  coal  to  make  liquid
fuels.  We  think  that  a  better  way  to  back  out  oil,  if  you  are  going
to use coal, is to make electricity with that coal and then use it to
make  plug-in  hybrid  vehicles.  We  think  that  can  deliver  more  bar-
rels  of  oil  per  ton  of  coal  with  many  fewer  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions.

So  instead  of,  you  raised  the  aircraft  issues,  we  need  to  look  at
this  as  an  overall  resource,  and  efficiency  driven  through  plug-in
hybrids  can  free  up  barrels  of  oil  that  then  can  be  available  for
other uses such as aircraft.

So  instead  of  spending  lots  of  money  to  produce  a  new  fuel  for
the  Air  Force,  why  not  look  at  the  U.S.  Postal  Service,  have  that
fleet  converted  to  plug-in  hybrid  vehicles,  why  doesn’t  FedEx  look
at  converting  its  ground  fleet  to  plug-in  hybrid  vehicles,  and  free
up all or a part of the needs for the aircraft that need it.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  Dr.  Boardman,  do  you  have  a  response  to  Mr.

Hawkins’ statement?

REASONS TO START INVESTING IN COAL-TO-LIQUIDS

Dr. BOARDMAN. Thank you. I do. I will maybe add a new perspec-
tive here. When you look at the oil reserves to the production rates,
you  can  look  at  British  petroleum  statistics  published  two  years
ago  that  indicated  all  of  North  America,  if  we  continue  at  the  rate
of production, we will deplete those reserves within ten years. And
so that means that we have got to look towards, when we are look-
ing at all of the transportation vehicles and the heavy vehicles, our
demand for that oil, if that oil depletes and national security risks
go up correspondingly, we need to have an ability to generate that
fuel in terms of national security.

And I think it is important for us to begin to establish that infra-
structure  now  to  be  able  to  do  coal-to-liquids  because  it  does  take
time  to  do  that.  It  takes  time  to  build  that,  it  takes  heavy  equip-
ment  and  vessels.  We  don’t  have  that  capability  nor  that  experi-
ence.

So  the  first  few  plants  could  establish  that  capability  so  when
those  declining  reserves  do  eventually  meet  up  to  us,  we  are  pre-
pared to have an alternative for that liquid fuel.

Mr. COSTELLO. I thank you, and I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Costello.
Mr. Hall, five minutes.
Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, thank you.

SHOULD CARBONS BE TAXED?

I  have  listened  here  and  read  some  of  your  testimony.  I  go  back
to  the  reason  we  are  here  and  what  we  are  doing  here  and  the
major duty of a member of Congress, probably one of the major du-
ties  is  to  prevent  a  war.  And  right  now  today  the  major  war  I  see
by some of you on the panel there is a war against energy. You are
knocking fossil fuels. You are knocking coal.

I guess to Dr. Hawkins and Dr. Romm, I would have to say that
I  just  disagree  with  you.  You  are  both  pushing  the  fear  of  global
warming,  yet  you  don’t  have  any  answer  for  the  cost  of  it.  I  just
would  like  to  ask  Dr.  Hawkins  if  you  and  the  NRDC  and  Dr.
Romm,  if  you  and  the  Center  for  Energy  and  Climate  Solutions,
and I think this follows the question Dr.—Congressman McNerney
was asking about, I guess I would ask Dr. Romm, do you really be-
lieve  that  you  ought  to  tax  carbons?  Is  that  your,  isn’t  that  your
testimony?

Dr. ROMM. No. Well, I would prefer a cap and trade system.

PRICE OF CO2

Mr.  HALL.  Well,  yeah.  You  would  prefer  to  explain  it  away.  Let
me  read  it  to  you.  I  think  you  said,  ‘‘Instead  of  promoting  liquid
coal, Congress must address the climate problem by establishing a
cap  on  emissions  that  creates  a  price  for  carbon  dioxide.’’  What  do
you mean by that? If that is not a tax.

Dr.  ROMM.  Well,  taxes  go  to  the  Government,  and  in  a  cap  and
trade system the revenue is, typically goes, you know, is circulated
in the economy to find the lowest price for avoiding carbon dioxide
emissions. So——

Mr. HALL. Yeah, but there is a bump in the road there and either
way  you  go  it  runs  the  price  of  gasoline  up.  Now,  please  pick  that
up and explain it. Be practical with me, not theoretical.

Dr. ROMM. Sure. Let us be clear. There is no question that if you
put  a  cap  on  emissions,  carbon  dioxide  will  have  a  price.  But  you
have  all  these  panelists  here  who  are  telling  you  that  they  are
going to capture carbon dioxide from the coal-to-liquids process and
bury  it.  Well,  they  won’t  spend  a  penny  doing  that  unless  there  is
a price for carbon dioxide that gives them a reward for that.

Now,  I  think  what  Dr.  Hawkins  and  I  would  say  is  that  if  you
combine  energy  efficiency  with  a  switch  to  cleaner  fuels,  you  have
the  possibility  that  the  fuels  may  cost  more  but  because  you  are
using  them  more  efficiently,  your  energy  bill  won’t  go  up.  And
when I was at the Department of Energy we did a study with five
national laboratories which showed that you could substantially re-
duce the greenhouse gas emissions of the United States of America
without  increasing  the  Nation’s  Energy  Bill.  And  that  is  what  our
goal  is,  but  there  is  no  question  that  the  price  of  carbon-intensive
fuels  has  to  go  up.  If  the  price  of  carbon-intensive  fuels  doesn’t  go
up, why would anybody use less of them?

So,  yes,  we  are  in,  you  know,  I  am  certainly  in  the  camp  that
global  warming  and,  you  know,  this  is  a  Science  and  Technology
Committee, and the scientists of the world have spoken earlier this
year in the Inter-Governmental Panel on climate change——

Mr. HALL. Why do you express all your fears about global warm-
ing, though, and you never set forth a way to pay for it? Now, you,
yourself, know that China is not going to do anything but increase
the  intensity  of  the  damage  to  the  air,  and  yet  take  all  of  our  jobs
over there, and they are not going to pay 15 cents to help our com-
panies,  our  energy  companies  set  forth  energy  to  use  at  a  decent
figure.  Neither  is  Russia,  neither  is  Mexico,  neither  is  India.  I  can
go on down the road.

WHY NOT COAL-TO-LIQUID TO HELP ADDRESS GLOBAL

WARMING?

Why  would  you  set  forth  the  great  fear  of  global  warming  right
now  and  not  be  pushing  for  technology  like  coal-to-liquid,  like  we
have  suggested  here  and  use  the  abundance  of  coal  that  we  have
in this country to offset the fear of terrorists that threaten us? And
it is a national security issue.

Dr.  ROMM.  Well,  I  am  a  big  fan  of  reducing  oil  consumption.  I
wrote  an  article  entitled,  ‘‘Mid  East  Oil  Forever.’’  I  think  it  is  just
important  to  understand  that  there  is  no  point  in  addressing  the
energy security problem in a way that makes it harder to solve the
global  warming  problem.  I  don’t  think  there  is  any  question  that
the scientific consensus on global warming is clear. We have to re-
duce emissions, and I think there are a lot of bills before Congress
that would do just that. Coal-to-liquids does not address the global
warming problem.

Mr. HALL. In any way?
Dr. ROMM. In any way whatsoever, no, because you are left with

diesel fuel. Even if you cap——

Mr. HALL. Global warming. Oh, no. I agree with you on that.
Dr. ROMM. Okay. Then we are in agreement.
Mr. HALL. No. We are in great disagreement.

IS ENERGY SECURITY IMPORTANT?

Let me ask you and, let me ask Dr. Hawkins how he and NRDC
feels  and  you,  Dr.  Romm,  how  the  Center  for  Energy  and  Climate
Solutions  feel.  Let  me  ask  you  a  simple  question.  It  doesn’t  mean
to  be  an  insulting  question,  because  I  know  your  answer  is  going
to  be  yes.  Do  you  believe  energy  security  is  important?  Your  an-
swer is yes, isn’t it? For both of you.

Mr. HAWKINS. Yes, of course.
Mr. HALL. So if using carbon capture and storage technology can
give  CTL  a  better  life,  a  better  life  cycle,  greenhouse  gas  profile
than  imported  petroleum  and  a  much  better  performance  in  the
area  of  criteria  pollutants,  why  wouldn’t  the  NRDC  support  this,
and  why  wouldn’t  the  Center  for  Energy  and  Climate  Solutions
support that?

Mr. HAWKINS. The question, Mr. Hall, is not whether we support
backing out oil with domestic resources. We do. What we are trying
to urge this committee to look at is what is the best way to do this.
We  have  raised  a  number  of  questions  about  why  we  think  coal-
to-liquids is not the best way to back out oil, it is not the best way
to  use  coal  to  back  out  oil.  These  are  questions  that  if  you  don’t
look hard at them, you are going to make mistakes, and those mis-

takes are going to interfere with the objective of getting energy se-
curity,  and  they  are  going  to  hit  American  taxpayers  with  bigger
bills than they need to pay.

Those  are  the  questions  we  are  asking  you  to  take  a  hard  look

at.

SHOULD WE INCREASE DOMESTIC OIL PRODUCTION?

Mr.  HALL.  Okay.  If  you  are  opposed  to  CTL,  are  you  supporting
more  domestic  production  of  oil  then  in  order  to  help  our  national
security and decrease our dependence on foreign oil?

Mr. HAWKINS. Well——
Mr. HALL. It is all fossil fuels, isn’t it?
Mr. HAWKINS.—we have supported enhanced oil recovery because
we  do  think  that  it  is  better  to  get  additional  barrels  of  oil  out  of
already producing fields than it is to go into either unsecure areas
of the world or go into pristine areas so——

Mr.  HALL.  Not  drilling  on  Anwar  and  in  the  Gulf  and  offshore

Florida?

Mr. HAWKINS. We think there are——
Mr. HALL. Do you recommend that?
Mr. HAWKINS.—a few places——
Mr. HALL. Yes or no? Do you recommend that, sir?
Mr.  HAWKINS.  We  do  not  recommend  drilling  in  the  Arctic  Na-
tional  Wildlife  Refuge  (ANWR).  We  oppose  that.  We  do  support
drilling  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  where  existing  production  is  doing
just  fine,  thank  you,  and  we  support  a  wide  range,  which  is  out-
lined in my testimony, of producing resources both U.S. biofuels re-
sources,  as  well  as,  as  I  will  repeat  it  again,  efficiency  can  deliver
more  barrels  of  oil  equivalent  than  any  other  tool  in  the  toolbox.
And  I  would  just  state  American  consumers  don’t  value  barrels
of  oil.  They  value  mobility,  and  if  you  can  deliver  that  mobility
with  smarter  cars  that  use  fewer  barrels  of  oil,  then  we  are  better
off  from  an  energy  security  standpoint,  and  we  are  better  off  from
the standpoint of our wallets.

CONSTRUCTION OF POWER PLANTS

Mr.  HALL.  Last  question.  You  advocate  the  use  of  plug-in  hy-
brids. Do you therefore support the construction of a new coal-fired
electric  generation  plant?  I  support  nuclear  powered  electric  gen-
eration  plants.  Do  you  support  those?  They  add  much  needed  gen-
eration to the grid.

Mr.  HAWKINS.  We  think  that  new  power  plants  should  be  de-
signed to be the cleanest possible power plants. We are not picking
technologies  for  new  electric  power  plants.  We  just  did  a  research
report with the Electric Power Research Institute. We will need ad-
ditional  electric  power  capacity.  We  think  we  can  do  a  lot  more  on
renewable,  wind  and  solar  electric  sources,  and  we  are  really
pleased  that  the  State  of  Texas  is  doing  such  a  great  job  on  wind-
powered  electricity.  It  is  growing  faster  than  any  other  source  of
electricity  in  Texas,  and  your  state  is  a  real  leader  in  that  area.

MORE ON DOMESTIC OIL PRODUCTION

Mr.  HALL.  Yeah.  We  are  going  about  two  percent  of  the  energy.
That  is  a  big  deal.  Actually,  ANWR,  when  you  oppose  ANWR,  I
guess  it  is  because  it  is  too  pristine,  and  you  want  to  save  it  and
not  damage  little  ANWR.  It  is  just  19  million  acres  up  there,  and
the bill calls for drilling on 2,000 acres, and it is equivalent—I will
be practical with you and not scientific.

It is equivalent to saying if you take a football field, and you lay
a  dollar  bill  down  in  the  end  zone,  you  ruin  the  whole  field.  That
is outrageous, and you know it.

I yield back my time.

for being here today.

Mr. WARD. Well, and, again, I think it is important to remember
that  we  are  trying  to  deal  with  two  issues  at  the  same  time  here;
one  being  an  energy  security  issue  and  the  other  one  being  a  cli-
mate  change  issue.  And  they  are  both  crucially  important,  and  I
think some of the tension in this debate comes when we try to put
one over the top of the other.

What we are talking about with coal-to-liquids is using a domes-
tic  resource  that  we  have  to  replace  a  resource  that  exacts  a  tre-
mendous  cost  on  our  nation  and  our  economy  to  protect  the  access
to  it  in  other  parts  of  the  world,  largely  from  places  where  people
don’t  necessarily  like  us.  And  so  it  is  to  take  nothing  away  from
the need to do more for energy efficiency, to do more for new types
of  vehicles.  You  know,  the  hydrogen  economy,  if  we  can  ever  get
to that would be a wonderful place to be, but the reality is our pro-
duction and refining base today is at its maximum level. Our refin-
ing  facilities  are  located  in  places  that  are  vulnerable  to  terrorist
attacks  and  to  natural  disasters  like  hurricanes.  We  need  to  do

I have a special interest in this because as Dr. Boardman talked,
the  proposed  Baard  Energy  Project  would  be  in  my  district,  where
we  also,  Mr.  Hawkins,  we  made  lots  of  electricity  along  that  Ohio
River corridor in Ohio from Youngstown down to Cincinnati.

What  we  are  trying  to  do  is  to  find  alternate  ways  to  be  able  to
make  ourselves  less  dependent  on  foreign  oil,  and  I  believe  in,  not
only  because  of  the  fact  that  we  have  the  proper  things  to  bring
it  together  in  our  district,  we  also  have  the  need  in  our  country.
And to know that this fuel can be burned as clean or cleaner than
what  we  are  burning  and  we  are  not  paying  for  it  to  a  foreign
source, I think is very important.

One of the things that Mr. Ward talked about that I thought was
extremely  important  for  everyone  to  understand  and  conceptualize
about  this  is  that  the  CTL  is  actually  a  bridge  to  technology,  and
I  wanted  to  ask  you,  Mr.  Ward,  if  you  would  continue  on  that,  ex-
pand  on  it,  because  I  think  it  would  answer  some  of  the  questions
where folks were saying that we only have coal for 100 years. Well,
100 years is a long time.

But  if  you  would,  if  you  would  talk  on  that  as  to  what  really  is

the effect of CTL.

more  to  use  the  resources  we  have  and  expand  and  diversify  our
resource  base  for  producing  the  fuels  for  the  vehicles  we  drive
today.

Mr.  WILSON.  And  I  think  it  is  going  to  take,  and  please,  anyone
of  the  panel,  if  you  will,  please  disagree  with  me  if  you  do,  but  I
think it is going to take the implementation of all these things, not
just  coal-to-liquid,  not  just  wind,  not  just  solar  panels,  but  all  of
them,  and  the  sooner  we  realize  that  and  begin  moving  in  that  di-
rection, I think the better off we are going to be.

CTL SUCCESS IN OTHER COUNTRIES

One of the points that I would want to ask to the panel is if coal-
to-liquid  is  not  the  right  way  to  go,  why  are  so  many  other  coun-
tries doing it and some becoming very successful with it? Does any-
one have any comment on that?

Mr.  WARD.  Well,  let  me  just  take  a  quick  one  and  point  out,  for
instance,  China  is  a  country  that  attracts  a  lot  of  our  interest.
China  faces  many  of  the  same  dynamics  that  we  do.  They  are  de-
pendent on foreign sources of oil. In fact, they are dependent on the
same foreign sources of oil that we are, and they are making some
critical  decisions  right  now  as  to  what  they  need  to  do.  They  can
invest  billions  of  dollars  to  build  pipeline  capacity  to  bring  more
foreign  oil  from  the  coasts  to  their  interior  where  the  cities  are
growing,  or  they  can  invest  those  billions  of  dollars  in  developing
the  coal  resources  that  they  have  in  the  interior  for  making  liquid
fuels from their own resources. They are, in fact, investing the bil-
lions to do more with the resources they have.

Mr. WILSON. Exactly.
Mr. WARD.—to develop their CTL resources. So——
Mr. WILSON. Yes. Mr. Hawkins.
Mr.  HAWKINS.  If  I  could  comment.  Again,  the  debate  here  is  not
about providing incentives for technologies to get the job done. The
question  is  why  pick  a  fuel  and  why  pick  a  process  when  you  are
providing  those  incentives?  Why  not  focus  on  the  objective?  If  the
objective  is  to  back  out  oil,  then  give  incentives  that  are  open  to
all  comers  for  processes  that  back  out  oil.  If  the  objective,  as  we
believe it needs to be, is to cut global warming emissions, then pro-
vide  incentives  for  technologies  that  do  a  better  job  of  that.  Focus
on  the  objectives.  Don’t  try  to  pick  the  technology  or  fuel  winner.

I think that is, you know, the Philippines, India, a number of the
growing Asian countries are making similar types of decisions, and
it  is  easier  for  them  to  do  it  because  the  Government  has  a  more
direct role in building those first plants. The problem we face here
in  the  United  States  is  that  we  go  to  Wall  Street  and  ask  for  the
money,  and  until  we  get  the  first  few  plants  built,  there  is  a  tre-
mendous  resistance  from  the  private  capital  markets.  Everybody
wants to be the first person to build the fifth plant.

Mr.  WILSON.  Have  we  not,  Mr.  Chairman,  have  we  not  always
in  America,  though,  the  thing  that  has  made  us  above  and  better
than most others is the fact that we do provide the technology, and
we  are  able  to  move  forward  with  the  challenges  we  have  because
we are willing to take the risks and to do what is responsible.

Mr.  WARD.  Well,  we  are  providing  the  technology  that  the  Chi-

nese are using——

INVESTING IN CTL

Dr. ROMM. If I could add two points. One is China appears to be
scaling  back  their  effort  on  CTL,  and  I  posted  on  my  blog,
climateprogress.org,  a  couple  of  articles  that  go  to  that  very  point.
So  I  think  it  is  important  to  understand  that  CTL  is  not  taking
over the planet.

I  think  the  other  important  thing  to  understand  is  we  have  $70
a  barrel  oil.  We  do  not  have  any  CTL  plants  in  this  country.  Now,
people  tell  you,  we  could  spend  money  to  solve  the  water  problem,
make the plants more expensive. We could spend money to capture
the  carbon.  No  one  is  building  these  plants  because  they  cost  $5
billion  for  80,000  barrels  a  day.  They  are  phenomenally  expensive
plants.  They  are  not  profitable  at  current  prices  of  oil.  They  are
going  to  be  infinitely  less  profitable  if  you  try  to  deal  with  their
water and their CO2.

So it doesn’t make a lot of sense for the Government to push CTL
down  the  throats  of  consumers.  They  are  just,  they  don’t  make  a
lot of sense economically or environmentally.

Mr.  WILSON.  If  I  could  comment  on  that,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  think
there  are  two  things  in  play  there.  Number  one,  why  are  we  look-
ing  for  coal-to-liquid?  It  is  simply  because  we  have  an  abundance
of coal.

And  secondly,  I  believe  it  is  very  important  to  realize  that  this
technology  is  something  that  is  going  to,  if  we  are  paying  $70  a
barrel now, who is to say we are not paying 170 a year from now?
And so what this does if we get these plants up and going, it gives
us some balance in which we need badly right now. Mr. Ward.

Mr.  BARTIS.  Can  I  comment?  I  am  a  little  concerned  because
what I hear is a lot of second guessing of the marketplace here and
what  works  and  what  doesn’t  work.  The  fact  is  is  that  we  have  a
technology.  It  is  one  of  the  few  choices  that  we  have  that  is  ready
now.  It  is  coal-to-liquids  with  Fischer-Tropsch.  The  problem  with
that technology is that we have got a concern with global warming,
and  we  have  not  proven  that  we  can  sequester  the  carbon  dioxide
emissions. That is a fact.

That fact says that we should not be putting together any incen-
tive  that  promotes  a  large  coal-to-liquids  industry.  It  doesn’t  mean
that we shouldn’t invest small amounts of money to get some early
experience,  and  there  is  a  big  difference  between  the  Government
trying  to  pick  winners,  rather  than  looking  at  coal-to-liquids  first,
as insurance, a small insurance policy.

The  other  thing  I  wanted  to  say  is  that  I  think  it  is  very  impor-
tant to endorse what David Hawkins has said, that we focus on ob-
jectives  and  not  on  technologies.  There  is  too  much  willingness
among all parties it seems to me to try to pick this particular tech-
nology  or  that  technology.  The  true  objectives  are,  you  know,  im-
port less oil, use less oil, and put out fewer emissions of CO2.

And  addressing  one  doesn’t  mean  you  are  going  to  fix  the  other
one.  For  example,  we  know  that  if  we  pass  legislation  that  puts  a
premium  on  carbon  emissions  adequate  to  sequester  emissions  for
electricity  production,  which  is  about  $30  I  believe,  a  ton  of  CO2
according  to  the  MIT  study,  that  legislation  is  only  going  to  raise
the price of gasoline 35 cents a gallon.

This increase in the price of gasoline is just not enough to cause
anyone  to  use  less  petroleum.  So  we  need  to  think  of  disincentives
or  incentives,  I  prefer  disincentives  because  they  encourage  effi-
ciency  in  conservation,  but  we  need  to  think  of  broad-based  incen-
tives  and  disincentives  for  using  less  petroleum  and  for  reducing
carbon dioxide emissions. That is the real key here.

Mr. WILSON. And I, if I may, Mr. Chairman, I think that is won-
derful in an ideal world, but we are in a real world, and it is a situ-
ation where we are going to have to do something with our energy
dependence, and we need to be moving on it now.

CTL EMISSIONS

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman LAMPSON. Mr. Hill, five minutes.
Mr.  HILL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Gentleman,  I  am  not  a
member  of  this  committee,  but  I  am  very  interested  in  this  whole
issue, because I am from Indiana, which produces a lot of coal.

One  of  the  things  that  I  have  learned  in  my  years  in  Congress
it  is  very  hard  to  determine  what  the  facts  are  in  this  city,  and  I
have  been  listening  to  you  for  an  hour  now,  and  I  still  don’t  know
what the facts are. So maybe we can clear up some of these things.
Mr.  Ward,  you  said  that  coal-to-liquids  is  cleaner  than  the  way

we produce gasoline today from oil.

Mr. WARD. Yes, sir. The fuels that result from a CTL process are

cleaner than the fuels that come from a traditional——

Mr. HILL. Okay.
Mr. WARD.—petroleum refinery.
Mr. HILL. Dr. Bartis, you said coal-to-liquids will produce 20 per-

cent greater carbon emissions than oil.

Dr. BARTIS. They will produce much more than 20 percent.
Mr. HILL. According to the Argonne National Labs. Who is right

here? Are you right, or is Mr. Ward right?

Dr. BARTIS. Well, no. There are two different issues.
Mr. HILL. Okay.
Dr. BARTIS. We are talking about two different things. One is the
performance of the fuel after it is produced. The other issue is what
of  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  producing  the  fuel.  If  you  look
at a total fuel cycle basis, our calculations, and we have been very
careful  with  this  at  RAND,  our  calculations  show  about  2.2  times
as much as conventional petroleum. That is with nothing, not doing
any  carbon  management  at  all.  Just  putting  all  the  emissions  into
the atmosphere.

Mr. HILL. So, Mr. Ward, how do you respond to that?
Mr. WARD. Two ways. Number one, we need to separate the pol-
lutants  in  fuel—sulfur,  NOΧ,  particulates,  the  things  that  make
people  sick—from  the  greenhouse  gas,  which  is  a  climate  change
issue.  On  the  pollutants  issue  there  is  no  question  that  the  CTL
fuels  are  much  cleaner  than  the  petroleum  fuels  that  they  are  re-
placing.

On  the  greenhouse  gas  climate  change  issue,  if  you  capture  and
sequester  the  carbon  during  the  manufacturing  process,  you  can
make  those  CTL  fuels  on  a  life  cycle  basis  be  no  worse  than  the
petroleum that they are replacing.

92

Mr.  HILL.  Okay.  So  someone  said  that  the  technology  as  it  re-

lates to carbon sequestration is not here yet.

Mr.  WARD.  I  would  disagree  with  that,  sir.  The  largest  coal  gas-
ification  plant  in  the  country  is  in  North  Dakota,  Dakota  Gasifi-
cation. It is 30 miles down the road from a coal-to-liquids plant we
are  looking  at  building.  They  capture  and  sequester  their  carbon
for  enhanced  oil  recovery.  All  of  the  coal-to-liquids  developers  I
work  with  in  the  United  States  are  planning  to  capture  their  CO2
and sell it for the purposes of enhanced oil recovery.

You  know,  as  we  look  at  needing  to  move  to  carbon  capture  and
storage  for  the  electricity  generation  sector,  I  think  we  would  be
missing  an  opportunity.  Here  is  the  CTL  industry  that  is  willing
to  embrace  and  deploy  carbon  capture  and  storage  technologies  on
a large scale right now, these are the demonstration projects where
we  are  going  to  learn  the  things  we  need  to  know  so  that  we  can
go  back  and  retrofit  carbon  capture  and  storage  onto  our  existing
base of electricity generation that produces 50 percent of the power
in this country.

COAL SUPPLY

Mr.  HILL.  Okay.  So  let  me  switch  then  to  what  Congressman
Bartlett  has  said.  Are  we  going  to  run  out  of  coal  soon  if  we  in-
crease production by five percent?

Mr. WARD. I do not believe we are. There is some noise on some
newspaper  article  that  appeared  recently  that  was  looking  at
known  pieces.  One  of  the  things  about  coal  that  is  similar  to  what
it  is  about  oil  is  you  need  to  look  at  what  these  surveys  are  based
on. Are the surveys based on the exploration that has identified the
fields  that  are  fully  characterized,  or  are  they  based  on  what  we
know  is  out  there  and  haven’t  gone  looking  for  yet  because  there
is  no  reason  to.  The  studies  I  referred  to  earlier  by  the  National
Coal  Council  and  the  Southern  States  Energy  Board  have  both
identified  more  than  ample  coal  reserves  here  in  the  country  to
support both electricity generation and transportation fuels.

MORE ON INVESTING IN CTL

mean——

Mr.  HILL.  Well,  then  why  isn’t  this  happening,  Mr.  Ward?  I

Mr. WARD. Well——
Mr. HILL.—if it is a no-brainer, why is it not happening?
Mr.  WARD.—it  will  happen,  and  my  position  is  that  you  will  see
a coal-to-liquids industry in this country. The question is how fast.
The $70 oil price issue came up a minute ago. If my coal-to-liquids
plant was running today in a $70 a barrel oil environment, I would
be  making  good  money  with  that  facility.  The  question  is  when  I
go  to  Wall  Street  and  say,  please  loan  me  $3  billion  to  build  this
plant,  look  at  how  good  it  is  at  $70  oil,  they  say,  well,  what  is  the
oil  price  going  to  be  in  five  years  when  you  are  paying  back  the
loan after you build this?

Mr. HILL. So what should we do?
Mr.  WARD.  What  we  should  do  on  the  commercialization  side  is
put  in  place  a  limited  number  of  deployment  incentives  to  take
some  of  that  oil  volatility  price  risk,  and  there  is  two  or  three  dif-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:08 Apr 21, 2008 Jkt 037639 PO 00000 Frm 00096 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\090507\37639 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

93

ferent proposals floating around on the Hill now that could do that.
But for the first two or three plants or four or five, pick a number,
plants, alleviate that oil price volatility factor so you can get those
plants  running.  Then  when  you  go  to  build  the  fourth  and  fifth
plant,  the  people  on  Wall  Street  have  something  to  look  at,  you
have got a facility working.

You  know,  we  will  get  a  coal-to-liquids  industry,  you  know,  oil
keeps  going  up,  it  gets  to  $100,  $120  a  barrel,  people  are  going  to
start building these things anyway. You can let it go that way, but
that  does  nothing  to  address  the  energy  security  issue  of  reducing
your dependence on foreign oil before we face another crisis.

Mr. HILL. My red light is on. I have got like 100 more questions,

Mr. Chairman, but I will let it go at that. Thank you.

Chairman LAMPSON. Mr. Matheson, you are recognized.

MORE ON CTL EMISSIONS

Mr.  MATHESON.  Well,  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Mr.  Ward,  I
wanted  to  ask  you  a  question  first.  What  do  you  feel  is  an  appro-
priate  level  of  environment  performance  for  CTL  facilities  that
should  be  met  in  order  to  achieve  some  kind  of  federal  financial
support?

Mr.  WARD.  I  believe  that  the  reason  for  pursuing  coal-to-liquids
is as a bridge strategy to help us with energy security issues while
we  develop  the  fuels  and  the  strategies  of  the  future.  Therefore,  I
believe if a coal-to-liquids facility can produce a fuel that is cleaner
than the petroleum fuel that it replaces from a pollutant standard,
and  is  better  than  the  petroleum  fuel  it  replaces  from  a  life  cycle
greenhouse  gas  standard,  that  should  qualify  for  deployment-type
incentives to get these plants built.

After that, these plants are going to be subject to the same regu-
lations or regulatory regimes, whether it is a carbon tax or cap and
trade  system  or  whatever  this  Congress  ultimately  enacts  to  meet
our greater goals of dealing with climate change——

Mr. MATHESON. Uh-huh.
Mr. WARD.—these plants will also be subject to future reductions
to  meet  that  system.  And  we  will  do  those  things  through  some  of
the technologies that have been discussed today like biomass firing
and other technologies that are out there.

But  to  qualify  for  deployment  incentives,  if  what  we  are  trying
to  do  is  improve  our,  if  what  we  are  trying  to  do  is  improve  our
energy security, what is wrong with the standard that says as long
as you are not going backwards, you qualify.

CTL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION

Mr.  MATHESON.  Let  me  also  ask  you  a  question,  we  have  heard
a lot in the context of coal-to-liquids about using biomass in connec-
tion  with  the  coal  for  making  liquid  transportation  fuels.  Where  is
this  technology  in  terms  of  its  opportunity  for  commercial  applica-
tion now?

Mr. WARD. And that is really an important question for this com-
mittee  where  you  are  looking  at  where  research  dollars  should  be
spent. Coal-to-liquids with carbon capture and storage for enhanced
oil  recovery  is  something  we  can  do  today.  There  is  commercially-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:08 Apr 21, 2008 Jkt 037639 PO 00000 Frm 00097 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\090507\37639 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

94

available  technologies,  there  are  commercially-financeable  tech-
nologies if we can deal with oil price risks.

The biomass coal gasification, biomass co-firing, that is earlier in
the scale. That is back where we need to do demonstration projects.
There is probably some more basic research that needs to be done.
Those are areas where we should be spending research dollars, not
deployment  dollars  in  order  to  develop  that  technology  so  that  it
will be useful in making future environmental improvements down
the road.

Mr. MATHESON. And what are the environmental benefits of that

technology combining the two?

Mr. WARD. Well, when you combine the two, when you do carbon
capture and storage and utilize biomass strategies, you can now go
from a fuel that is as good as or a little better than the petroleum
you are replacing to having a liquid fuel that is significantly better
than the petroleum fuel that you are replacing.

Mr. MATHESON. And just maybe just to clarify what you said, be-
cause  the  Science  Committee  has  jurisdiction  over  research  fund-
ing.  You  are  suggesting  that  for  this  committee  that  is  an  appro-
priate thing to take a look at?

Mr.  WARD.  Exactly.  And  my  testimony  outlined  three  areas  that
I  think  are  most  appropriate  for  research  dollars  in  this  area,  bio-
mass  being  one  of  them,  doing  more  complete  work  on  setting
standards  for  life  cycle  assessments  for  comparing  these  tech-
nologies  to  other  fossil  fuels  is  a  second  one,  and  then  continuing
to  broaden  the  options  and  knowledge  of  carbon  sequestration  ac-
tivities outside of enhanced oil recovery is the third.

Mr.  MATHESON.  Okay.  I  appreciate  that.  And  I  am  sorry  I  was
not  here  at  the  start  of  the  hearing,  and  I  wanted  to  welcome  Mr.
Ward, who is from Utah. I would have introduced you if I was here
at the start of the hearing, but I didn’t make it in time.

Mr. WARD. That is okay. You would have said something disrepu-

table.

CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION

Mr.  MATHESON.  One,  just  one  last  question  I  will  throw  out  to
any  witness  on  the  Committee  in  terms  of  the  carbon  capture  and
storage  issue.  It  seems  to  me  that  these  are,  you  know,  CTL  and
CCS  are  both  sort  of  in  play  right  now.  Can  anyone  talk  about—
give the Science Committee direction on the difference between the
different  available  forms  of  carbon  capture  and  sequestration  and
the  types  of  research  that  this  committee  ought  to  encourage  to
help  enhance  policy  support  for  different  types  of  carbon  capture
sequestration?

That is for anybody who wants to answer that.
Dr. BARTIS. Carbon capture and sequestration is one of the great
challenges of the next few decades in my view, and there are a va-
riety  of  approaches  to  take,  but  the  most  important  approach  in
terms  of  how  much  can  be  captured  is  geologic  sequestration.  En-
hanced  oil  recovery  is  significant,  and  it  is  good  for  the  first  few
CTL  plants.  It  is  important  that  they  probably  do  something  like
that,  but  if  we  want  to  go  beyond  that,  we  are  going  to  have  to  do
something much more significant. But right now the federal budget

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:08 Apr 21, 2008 Jkt 037639 PO 00000 Frm 00098 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\090507\37639 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

95

on  carbon  capture  and  sequestration  is  about  $80  million  a  year,
and that is just way too low for the challenge that is ahead.

And  the  critical  steps  here  are  to  have  very  large  scale  dem-
onstrations,  and  what  is  important  if  you  have  a  large  scale  dem-
onstration is that you don’t just focus on the engineering. There is
a  tremendous  amount  of  basic  science,  geological  sciences,  geo-
chemistry,  geophysics,  that  has  to  accompany  any  of  these  large
scale  demonstrations.  Otherwise  we  really  won’t  understand  what
we are doing.

And  we  have  good  scientists  who  are  working  on  this,  and  this
is  a  real  big  challenge,  not  just  for  coal-to-liquids,  for  everything.

Mr. MATHESON. For everything. Yeah.
Dr.  ROMM.  If  I  could  just  add,  the  Science  Committee  has  to,  I
would, if it wants to support carbon capture and storage, should de-
velop  an  accepted  scientific  process  for  identifying  and  certifying
geologic repositories. I mean, I would point out we have spent how
long trying to certify one repository for nuclear waste. We are talk-
ing  about  dozens  of  repositories  for  carbon  dioxide,  and  we  don’t
have  any  institutionalized  process  for  how  you  identify  and  certify
that some repository is going to be safe and permanent.

Mr. MATHESON. Dr. Freerks.
Dr. FREERKS. I do believe that the geo sequestration partnership
is doing exactly that. They are looking at sites throughout the U.S.
I  believe  there  are  seven  sites  that  have  been  chosen.  They  are
going  to  sequester  millions  of  tons  of  CO2 and  prove  the  capture
nature  of  that  geo  sequestration  and  verify  all  the  issues  that  go
along with that, including any leakage and migration.

And  there  are  multiple  places  where  this  has  already  been  dem-
onstrated.  In  Norway  there  are  two  major  sites  that  have  already
been  using  saline  aquifers,  and  there  is  Devonian  shale  in  other
areas that can store massive amounts of CO2 by the terms in which
we  are  making  CO2 right  now.  We  can  store  CO2 for  several  hun-
dred years, if not, I think 600 years has been proposed by Dr. Scott
Clara of the NETL in their study of geo sequestration.

So  there  is  a  lot  of  data  supporting  the  sequestration  of  CO2 for
the long-term and making it a viable technology for all of the ways
that  we  produce  energy  through  combustion  and  CO2,  and  then
now  it  really  comes  down  to  how  do  we  capture  that  CO2 and  put
it  into  the  ground.  Well,  coal-to-liquids  offers  the  best  opportunity
for  doing  that  because  we  have  to  capture  the  CO2 as  part  of  the
process.  So  there  is  no  inherent  additional  costs  for  scrubbing  the
CO2 out of our concentrated streams.

Where there would be from coal-fired power plants or from oil re-

fineries or even from fermentation into ethanol.

Mr.  MATHESON.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  see  my  time  has  expired,
but I do want to thank the panel, and I would suggest as a Science
Committee  issue,  in  terms  of  figuring  out  what  we  can  do  to  en-
courage  understanding  of  carbon  capture  sequestration,  if  any  of
the  witnesses  want  to  provide  additional  testimony  that  gives  di-
rection  for  us  or  any  ideas,  I  think  that  is  an  issue  that  this  com-
mittee ought to take a look at.
And with that I yield back.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much.  We  have  passed  the
Udall legislation that has to do with carbon sequestration, and ob-
viously there is more yet that we have to do.

I  have  been  looking  for  a  way  to  get  Mr.  Hall  indebted  to  me.
I  think  I  may  have  just  found  it.  I  am  going  to  yield  time  to  Mr.
Hall for a question.

Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  will  ask  a  question  of  you.  Are  you

going to give us some time to send letters——

Chairman LAMPSON. You bet.
Mr. HALL.—and inquiries to these gentlemen?
Chairman LAMPSON. You bet we are.
Mr. HALL. As you may remember, I offered an amendment to the
biofuels  bill  establishing  an  R&D  program,  looking  into  a  practice.
It was unfortunately voted down during markup, but if you will re-
member,  I  had  a  little  better  luck  on  offering  a  motion  to  instruct
conferees,  asking  the  managers  on  the  part  of  the  House  that  the
conference on H.R. 2272 to be instructed, if you remember that. In-
sist on language prioritizing the early career grants to science and
engineering  researchers  for  the  expansion  of  domestic  energy  pro-
duction  and  use  through  coal-to-liquids.  And  this  passed  by  a  vote
of 258 to 167, and most of you guys over there voted for it.

I  am  going  to  write  to  each  of  these  men  and  ask  them  if  they
favor  providing  grants  to  our  young  scientists  and  engineers  to
focus  on  R&D  and  these  questions  and  whether  or  not  that  is  an
appropriate  or  inappropriate  expenditure  by  the  Federal  Govern-
ment and recommendation by this group.

And  I  thank  you  for  your  answers,  and  I  thank  you,  Mr.  Chair-

man. I do owe you.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Hall.  I  think  this  has  been
a very informative hearing, and we have, maybe it has raised more
questions  for  some  of  us  than  we  had  when  we  first  came  in,  and
obviously  we  do  want  the  record  to  remain  open  for  additional
statements  from  Members  and  for  answers  to  any  follow-up  ques-
tions  that  the  Committee  may  ask  of  the  witnesses.  I  know  that  I
have got some that I will, indeed, be forwarding out to you.

So  as  we  bring  this  hearing  to  a  close  I  want  to  thank  the  wit-
nesses  for  testifying  before  the  Committee  today.  You  are  excused,
and this committee is now adjourned.

[Whereupon, at 12:00 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Richard  D.  Boardman,  Senior  Consulting  Research  and  Development

Lead, Idaho National Laboratory

Questions submitted by Representative Jerry McNerney
Q1. Expanded  use  of  coal-to-liquids  technology  could  increase  the  high  burden  on
available  water  supplies,  particularly  in  the  West.  You  discussed  possible  tech-
nical solutions that would dramatically reduce the amount of water used in the
F–T process.

Q1a. Please explain the status of these techniques, how difficult they would be to im-

plement on a large scale, and how costly their implementation might be.

A1a. In  my  testimony,  I  stated  that  the  amount  of  water  required  for  a  coal-to-liq-
uids  plant  could  be  as  high  as  8–10  barrels  per  barrel  of  diesel  fuel  produced  for
an INL case study. This would be the case when no effort is made to treat and recy-
cle the water that is discharged at several locations throughout the plant. The figure
below gives a conceptual view of the water input and effluent streams for a notional
coal-to-liquid  plant.  The  gasifier  is  feed  coal  and  steam,  at  a  ratio  of  about  one
pound  of  steam  per  pound  of  dried  coal  (at  10  percent  moisture).  This  translates  to
roughly 2.5 barrels of water per barrel of F–T product. More water (about one barrel
per barrel of liquid product) is injected into the hot syngas to quench the hot syngas
in  order  to  remove  particulate  and  soluble  pollutants.  Additional  water  is  required
to  produce  hydrogen  in  the  CO  shift  reactor.  The  typical  amount  required  for  the
shift  reaction  is  approximately  0.5  barrel  of  water  per  barrel  of  product.  Next,  a
large  amount  of  cooling  water  must  be  used  to  cool  the  gasifier  vessel  and  the  F–
T  reactors  and  product  upgrade  refinery,  which  ultimately  results  in  low-pressure
steam  which  when  vented  to  the  atmosphere  can  be  as  much  as  an  additional  4–
6  barrels  of  cooling  water  per  barrel  of  product.  In  sum,  the  water  input  is  about
8 to 10 barrels (or 2.5 + 1 + 0.5 + 4–6 barrels of water).

In order to reduce the water consumption, the moisture that is recovered from the
coal  drying  process  can  be  used  to  make  up  the  steam  that  is  co-injected  with  the
coal. This amounts to a net gain of one-quarter (1/4) to one (1) barrels of water per
barrel  of  product  that  can  be  offset  for  an  eastern  coal  or  western  lignite,  respec-
tively.  Next,  water  from  the  air  separation  unit  (ASU)  can  be  obtained,  in  the
amount  of  about  0.25  barrels  of  water  per  barrel  of  product,  depending  on  the  rel-
ative  humidity  which  obviously  would  be  less  for  plant  in  the  Western  Mountain
States.  Quench  system  water  and  RectisolΤΜ blowdown  can  be  treated  and  used  in
the plant, netting approximately one (1) barrel more of water per barrel of product.
The F–T process also produces about one (1) barrel of water per barrel of F–T prod-
uct. This by-product water can be treated to remove water-soluble light organics for
use  throughout  the  plant.  Finally,  the  cooling  tower  condensate  can  be  treated  and
recycled,  thus  reducing  cooling  water  make  up  by  67  percent.  This  would  reduce
water  use  by  an  additional  2.5–4  barrels  of  water  per  barrel  of  F–T  fuels  product.
All  of  the  above  process  steps  should  be  considered  standard  practice,  and  together
amount to about 10–15 percent increase in total capital cost and 10 percent in oper-
ating costs of the plant. Collectively, these practices would lower the water demand
to around 3–5 barrels of water per barrel of product.

Finally, I referred to implementing commercially available, but expensive air-cool-
er heat exchangers to replace the steam cooling tower. An expensive closed-loop or-
ganic refrigerant cycle could also be deployed to cool the low-grade, unusable steam.
This  option  would  however  be  expensive,  but  could  be  offset  by  revenue  from  sur-
plus power that can be produced by expanding the refrigerant. Both of these options
would increase the capital costs by approximately five percent, but would reduce the
water demand to 1.5–3 barrels of water per barrel of product.

Q1b. What are the realistic prospects for substantially reducing the amount of water

used in coal-to-liquid production?

A1b. As  can  be  seen  by  my  analysis,  proper  consideration  for  using  the  water  dis-
charges  from  coal  drying,  the  quench  system,  F–T  by-product  water,  and  cooling
tower  operations  can  significantly  cut  the  water  demand,  at  a  cost  of  around  10–
15  percent  of  the  total  capital  cost  of  the  plant,  and  an  operating  cost  increase  of
only  10  percent.  For  an  additional  capital  cost  increase  of  around  five  percent,  the
theoretical  water  consumption  can  be  reduced  to  as  little  as  one  (1)  to  two  (2)  bar-
rels of water per barrel of product. Currently, some projects are claiming they have
reduced  the  water  demand  to  as  low  as  one-half  (1/2)  barrels  of  water  per  barrel
of  product  for  a  plant  using  high  moisture  lignite  or  sub-bituminous  coal,  and  by
implementing all practical water reclamation technology.

Based on my study of refinery plants and coal-fired power plants that already use
air-cooler heat exchangers in arid climates, my opinion remains consistent with my
testimony;  that  is,  the  practical  limit  of  water  demand—accounting  for  1)  potable
water  use,  2)  yard  water  uses  such  as  dust  control,  3)  normal  steam  cleaning  of
equipment,  4)  steam  leaks,  5)  water  discharges  limits  to  existing  streams  or  deep-
well injection, 6) practical limits to air-cooler heat exchangers, and 6) cost-risk con-
straints  associated  with  closed-loop  refrigeration—is  around  three  (3)  barrels  of
water to barrel of product.
Q1c. Is it possible to reduce the amount of water required to a low enough level, rel-
ative  to  the  price  of  gasoline,  that  it  is  economically  viable  to  produce  coal-
based fuels on a larger scale?

A1c. Only  a  subjective  opinion  can  be  given  to  this  question,  based  on  semi-tech-
nical bias. When the cost of petroleum crude remains above $75–80 per barrel, then
my  economical  assessment  indicates  that  F–T  fuels  will  be  competitive  with  cor-
responding  gasoline  costs  of  around  $2.75  per  gallon,  and  diesel  fuel  cost  upwards
of  $3.10  per  gallon,  as  at  the  end  of  the  summer  season,  2007.  This  assessment  in-
cludes  both  capital  and  operating  costs  required  to  treat  and  recycle  recovered  and
produced water in the plant to achieve a water consumption rate of 3–5 barrels per
barrel of fuel product.

With  respect  to  water  demands  in  the  Western  U.S.,  in  my  testimony,  I  rec-
ommended  that  water  currently  being  co-produced  with  conventional  crude  oil  or
coal-bed  methane  production  be  used  to  support  co-located  coal-to-liquids  projects.
There  is  sufficient  water  to  supply  several  large  plants  for  the  life  span  of  these
plants. It may be necessary to impound, or store this water at some additional cost;
however,  these  costs  are  not  substantial,  and  would  not  raise  the  operating  cost

more  than  approximately  five  percent.  With  this  nominal  increase,  F–T  diesel  fuel
would still be competitive with current market prices.

Although the West is water-constrained, the amount of water required for a large
complex  of  coal-to-liquid  plants  producing  upwards  of  300,000  barrels  of  F–T  fuels
per day, at 3:1 barrels of water per barrel of F–T fuels, would require less than one
percent  of  the  upper  Colorado  River,  Columbia  River,  upper  Platt  River,  and  upper
Missouri River stream flows.
