HEARING CHARTER

SUBCOMMITTEE ON SPACE AND AERONAUTICS

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Future Markets for
Commercial Space

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 20, 2005

9:30 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On  Wednesday,  April  20,  at  9:30  a.m.,  the  Subcommittee  on  Space  and  Aero-
nautics  will  hold  a  hearing  to  examine  the  future  of  the  commercial  space  market
and  the  government’s  role  in  that  future.  Last  year,  the  President  signed  into  law
the  Science  Committee’s  Commercial  Space  Launch  Amendments  Act,  which  dealt
with regulating one aspect of commercial space—private, human sub-orbital flights,
which are generally intended for space tourism.

The  first  panel  at  the  hearing  will  examine  the  potential  for  space  tourism,  with
a focus on last year’s successful flights by SpaceShipOne, the world’s first privately-
built and human-piloted spacecraft.

Built  by  famed  aircraft  developer  Burt  Rutan,  SpaceShipOne  last  year  won  the
Ansari  X–Prize,  a  $10  million  kitty  raised  by  space  enthusiasts  to  stimulate  entre-
preneurial  interest  in  space  flight.  Rutan’s  ship  was  the  first  to  fly  to  an  altitude
of more than 100 kilometers twice in two weeks, beating 25 other teams from seven
countries.

Virgin  Galactic,  founded  by  the  Virgin  entertainment  and  airline  company  owner
Richard  Branson,  has  announced  plans  to  buy  a  fleet  of  spacecraft  based  on
SpaceShipOne’s design to carry tourists into sub-orbital space (an altitude not suffi-
cient to orbit the Earth), possibly as early as 2008.

The  second  panel  will  examine  the  potential  of  the  wider  commercial  space  mar-
ket, which includes rockets to launch satellites and the satellites themselves, which
provide  services  ranging  from  beaming  images  of  landscapes  and  weather  patterns,
to global communications and entertainment. The commercial space market has had
a spotty record of success. The government is very involved in the commercial space
market  in  a  variety  of  ways,  including  providing  permits  for  launches  and  insuring
private  parties  against  catastrophic  accidents.  Perhaps  most  significantly,  the  gov-
ernment is a leading purchaser of both satellites and launch services.

Another  potential  aspect  of  the  commercial  market—private  provision  of  services
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to service the Inter-
national Space Station—will not be a focus of this hearing.
Witnesses:
FIRST PANEL:
Mr.  Burt  Rutan  founded  his  company  Scaled  Composites,  Inc.  in  1982.  For
SpaceShipOne’s achievements, Mr. Rutan this month received the Collier Aerospace
Trophy, the most prestigious prize in aeronautics.
Mr.  Will  Whitehorn  is  the  President  of  Virgin  Galactic  and  Group  Corporate  Af-
fairs and Brand Development Director for Virgin Management Limited.

SECOND PANEL:
Mr.  Elon  Musk  is  the  CEO  and  Chief  Technology  Officer  of  Space  Exploration
Technologies (SpaceX) in El Segundo, CA. He formerly founded two Internet compa-
nies, PayPal and Zip2 Corporation.
Mr.  John  W.  Vinter  is  Chairman  of  the  International  Space  Brokers  (ISB).  ISB
represents nine of the twenty satellite companies in the world and is the only insur-
ance broker that is focused exclusively on the space industry.

Overarching Questions:

The Committee will focus on the following questions at the hearing:

1. What is the outlook for the various aspects of the commercial space industry

over the next five to ten years?

2. What should the government do or not do to encourage the nascent commer-

cial space industry?

3. How can the commercial space industry avoid some of the pitfalls that have

led to unrealized expectations in the past?

Background:
The Rise of Commercial Space Industry and the Role of Legislation

From  the  dawn  of  the  space  age  through  much  of  the  1980s,  governments  domi-
nated efforts in space. Governments financed and owned most satellites, which were
launched on government-owned vehicles, including the Space Shuttle.

The  Challenger  accident  in  1986,  however,  helped  spur  private  sector  ownership
of  both  satellites  and  launch  vehicles.  After  the  Challenger  accident,  for  example,
government  agencies,  particularly  the  Department  of  Defense,  viewed  the  Space
Shuttle as too risky to be the sole launch vehicle for U.S. Government payloads and
began looking for alternatives.

The Science Committee passed the Commercial Space Launch Act (CSLA) of 1988,
which required NASA to purchase launch services for satellites from private compa-
nies  rather  than  purchasing  the  launch  vehicle  itself.  The  CSLA  ensured  a  market
for the nascent launch industry by requiring the government to be a customer.

The CSLA also provided another element intended to foster the success of the new
industry—indemnification  against  catastrophic  accidents.  Because  a  single  launch
failure  had  the  potential  of  causing  billions  of  dollars  of  damage  should  the  debris
fall  on  populated  areas,  the  private  sector  argued  that  no  private  insurance  com-
pany would offer coverage to a satellite company or launch provider unless the gov-
ernment  agreed  to  indemnify  (that  is,  pay  for)  at  least  a  portion  of  the  potential
damages.

The  CSLA  indemnifies  companies  for  catastrophic  losses—losses  above  the
amount of damages that private insurers calculate to be the maximum probable loss
(for  which  private  insurers  themselves  provide  coverage)  to  a  ceiling  of  $1.5  billion.
While  there  is  debate  over  whether  indemnification  is  necessary  as  the  satellite
launch  industry  matures,  Congress  last  year,  led  by  the  Science  Committee,  ex-
tended the indemnification provisions of the CSLA through December 31, 2009.

The  CSLA  also  established  a  permitting  process  within  the  Office  of  Commercial
Space Transportation (known as AST), now housed within the Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration (FAA), for all private commercial launches.

Last year, as SpaceShipOne became the first privately funded, developed, and op-
erated  spacecraft  to  carry  a  person  into  sub-orbital  space,  the  Science  Committee
passed legislation designed to foster a commercial space tourism industry. The Com-
mercial  Space  Launch  Amendments  Act  of  2004  gave  AST  explicit  authority  to  per-
mit  launches  with  humans  on  board  and  provided  guidance  on  how  to  use  that  au-
thority. One key provision created a new kind of permit that would facilitate flights
by experimental vehicles, modeled on the regime another part of FAA uses to regu-
late  airplanes.  (That  part  of  FAA  is  known  as  AVR.)  Another  key  provision  limited
the  extent  to  which  AST  could  regulate  passenger  safety  in  the  near-term.  (A  sum-
mary of the Act is attached.)
The Challenges Faced by Commercial Space Industries

Commercial space industries today include communication satellite developers (in-
cluding  radio,  television,  and  telecommunications),  launch  service  providers  (whose
customers include the government), satellite imagery companies, and perhaps soon,
space  tourism  companies  like  Virgin  Galactic  and  companies  servicing  the  Inter-
national Space Station.

One  of  the  first  challenges  these  companies  face  is  securing  financing.  Space  as-
sets are expensive, and launching into space is fraught with risk. One or two launch
failures  can  drive  a  company  into  bankruptcy.  Finding  investors  is  thus  very  dif-
ficult  for  new  entrants  in  the  space  business,  who  frequently  must  court  risk-seek-
ing, ‘‘angel investors’’ rather than relying on more established financing firms.

Space  industries  must  also  secure  insurance.  But  there  are  limits  to  the  private
pool  of  insurance  available,  which  can  pose  a  challenge  to  newcomers  to  the  space
business,  who  necessarily  lack  a  track  record  to  demonstrate  their  reliability  to  in-
surers.  Moreover,  costly  failures  in  one  portion  of  the  space  industry  can  affect  the
availability of insurance for the rest.

Perhaps  the  greatest  challenge  commercial  space  industries  face  is  capturing  a
market  large  enough  to  sustain  them.  Unfortunately,  their  history  of  success  in
doing so has been spotty. The commercial satellite imagery or remote sensing indus-
try has failed to develop as originally expected. But satellite radio seems to be gain-
ing in popularity despite the abundance of free competition on more traditional air-
waves.

Still, markets can be elusive. For example, optimism for communications satellite
manufacturers ran high in the 1990s when markets opened in China and the former
Soviet  states,  where  there  was  little  permanent  communications  infrastructure.
Three  U.S.  companies  raced  to  take  advantage  of  the  seemingly  boundless  opportu-
nities.  Iridium,  a  Motorola  spinoff  based  in  Chicago,  was  the  first  company  in  the
race.  It  launched  66  communications  satellites  into  orbit.  Next  was  Globalstar,
which had planned to launch 48 satellites.

But  the  ground-based  cell  phone  industry  was  quicker.  Its  penetration  into  the
former Soviet and Chinese markets soon rendered Iridium’s and Globalstar’s invest-
ments practically useless. Iridum’s assets were ultimately sold to a group of private
investors, which continue to own and operate Iridium today. (The Department of De-
fense  continued  to  use  Iridium  throughout  the  change  in  ownership.)  A  third  com-
pany,  Teldesic,  had  planned  to  launch  288  satellites,  but  could  not  attract  enough
investors after the failure of Iridium and Globalstar.

As  satellite  producers  saw  their  fortunes  fade  so  did  those  companies  who  had
hoped  to  put  those  satellites  into  orbit.  Lockheed  Martin  and  McDonnell  Douglas
had earlier invested large sums, aided by the government, to develop a new genera-
tion of launch vehicles. Boeing launches Sea Launch and the Delta series of rockets
(obtained  when  Boeing  took  over  McDonnell  Douglas),  and  Lockheed  launches  the
Atlas series of rockets. The Europeans have a competing Ariane rocket.

Unlike  the  Space  Shuttle,  these  rockets  are  used  only  once,  so  they  are  known
as  Expendable  Launch  Vehicles  (ELVs).  The  most  advanced  of  the  Atlas  and  Delta
class vehicles, developed with the U.S. Air Force, are known as Evolved Expendable
Launch  Vehicles  (EELVs).  Elon  Musk  is  developing  a  series  of  rockets  dubbed  Fal-
con, which he believes will launch at a significantly lower cost.

With the decline of the satellite industry, the rocket manufacturers were left with
too  few  customers  to  easily  recoup  their  costs.  That  has  raised  the  cost  of  launches
to  the  government.  The  recently  released  White  House  Space  Transportation  Policy
is  designed  to  find  a  way  to  provide  enough  business  to  keep  two  competing  U.S.
entities  in  the  launch  market.  NASA’s  pending  decisions  on  how  to  launch  its  sci-
entific satellites and on how to launch the planned Crew Exploration Vehicle would
affect the market.
SpaceShipOne

Burt  Rutan’s  SpaceShipOne  is  an  effort  to  open  a  new  aspect  of  the  commercial
space  market—space  tourism.  Rutan  had  to  complete  two  consecutive  successful
flights  to  earn  the  X–Prize.  Those  flights  were  not  trouble-free.  The  vehicle  rolled
29 times during the first flight; the vehicle shook but had only a ‘‘little roll’’ during
the second flight, according to the pilot. No one was injured in either case.
Questions Asked of the Witnesses:

In  their  letters  of  invitation,  the  witnesses  were  asked  to  address  the  following

questions in their testimony:
Mr. Burt Rutan:

1. What  is  the  future  of  your  commercial  SpaceShipOne  program  and  do  you

see other customers beyond Virgin Galactic?

2. What should the government do or not do to encourage commercial space en-

deavors?

3. If  you  develop  other  vehicles,  where  would  you  expect  to  find  investors?  Do
you think the traditional investors of Wall Street are likely to step forward?
4. As you move into the commercial world, how do you expect to be able to get

insurance coverage?

Mr. Will Whitehorn:

6

1. When does Virgin Galactic plan to take ownership of the five SpaceShipTwos
that  it  has  ordered  from  Scaled  Composites?  How  soon  do  you  expect  to  be
flying? When do you expect to make a profit?

2. What  is  different  in  preparing  to  take  ownership  of  a  fleet  of  spaceships  vs.

Virgin Atlantic taking ownership of a fleet of airplanes?

3. What  preparation  are  you  engaged  in  for  the  commercial  use  of  these  vehi-

cles?

4. What, if anything, should the government be doing or not doing to encourage

commercial space?

Mr. Elon Musk:

1. What  business  plan  do  you  have  to  make  your  launch  vehicle  a  success  in

the commercial market?

2. What  do  you  see  as  the  outlook  for  commercial  space  activities  in  the  next

five years? The next ten years?

3. What, if anything, should the government do or not do to encourage the nas-

cent commercial space industry?

4. Are there implications for the commercial space industry as you see it in the

President’s announced Vision for Space Exploration?

Mr. John H. Vinter:

1. What kind of activities does your company include for insurance purposes in

its definition of ‘‘commercial space?’’

2. As  insurance  brokers,  what  do  you  see  as  the  outlook  for  commercial  space
activities  in  the  next  five  years?  The  next  ten  years?  How  do  you  think  we
can  avoid  exaggerated  expectations  for  the  industry,  such  as  those  that  oc-
curred in the low-Earth orbit (LEO) market in the late 1990s?

3. What, if anything, should the government do or not do to encourage commer-

cial space endeavors?

Mr. Wolfgang Demisch:

1. Considering  some  of  the  difficulties  in  the  past  for  commercial  space  busi-
ness,  (the  low-Earth  orbit  launches  anticipated  for  Iridium,  Teledesic,  etc.)
and the slow growth of the commercial remote sensing industry, what is your
outlook  for  this  nascent  commercial  space  launch  business  and  how  do  we
avoid the failures of the past?

2. In  the  entrepreneurial  commercial  space  arena,  when  would  you  expect  tra-
ditional  Wall  Street  investors  to  become  classic  ‘‘risk-reward’’  investors,  in
place of the ‘‘angel’’ investors that we see today?

3. What, if anything, should the government do or not do to encourage commer-

cial space endeavors?

Dr. Molly Macauley:

1. What kinds of activities would you include in ‘‘commercial space?’’
2. Is  the  U.S.  the  leader  in  ‘‘commercial  space?’’  How  does  it  compare  with  the

status of international commercial space?

3. What do you think the government should do or not do to encourage commer-

cial space?

4. What  do  you  see  as  the  outlook  for  commercial  space  activities  in  the  next

five years? The next ten years?

APPENDIX

7

Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004

H.R.  5382,  the  Commercial  Space  Launch  Amendments  Act  of  2004,  is  designed
to  promote  the  development  of  the  emerging  commercial  human  space  flight  indus-
try by putting in place a clear, balanced regulatory regime.

The  Act  assigns  to  the  Secretary  of  Transportation  jurisdiction  over  commercial
human  space  flight  and  requires  the  Secretary  to  craft  a  streamlined  experimental
certification process for sub-orbital reusable launch vehicles. The Secretary of Trans-
portation must ensure that only one license or permit is required to conduct human
space  flights.  By  its  licensing  or  permitting  of  flights,  the  United  States  does  not
certify the safety of the flights for passengers or crew.

The Act requires the Secretary of Transportation to protect the uninvolved public
when licensing commercial human space flights. The Act also requires that crew re-
ceive training and satisfy medical standards. Space flight participants must undergo
appropriate medical exams and training requirements, and must provide written in-
formed  consent  for  their  participation.  For  the  first  eight  years  after  enactment  of
the legislation, the Secretary of Transportation may issue regulations governing the
design or operation of a launch vehicle only if the design or operation has indicated
likely safety problems through operational experience.

SUMMARY OF H.R. 5382,

Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004

Introduced  by  Mr.  Rohrabacher  (CA)  and  co-sponsored  by  Mr.  Boehlert  (NY)  and

Mr. Gordon (TN)

Key features of the Act include:

is required to conduct human space flights;

crews relating to training and medical condition;

• The Act will make it easier to launch new types of reusable sub-orbital rock-
ets by allowing the Secretary of Transportation to issue experimental permits
that can be granted more quickly and with fewer requirements than licenses;
• Under  the  Act,  permits  will  allow  an  unlimited  number  of  experimental
flights,  rather  than  requiring  a  license  for  a  single  launch  or  small  number
of launches;
• The  Secretary  of  Transportation  must  ensure  that  only  one  license  or  permit
• The  Act  will  require  the  Secretary  of  Transportation  to  issue  regulations  for
• The Act will limit requirements for paying passengers (or ‘‘space flight partici-
pants’’)  a  medical  exam,  training,  and  to  being  informed  of  the  risks  of  their
participation and providing written, informed consent;
• By its licensing or permitting of flights, the United States does not certify the
• For  the  first  eight  years  after  enactment  of  the  legislation,  the  Secretary  of
Transportation  may  only  issue  regulations  governing  the  design  or  operation
of a launch vehicle if the design or operation has indicated likely safety prob-
lems through operational experience;
• The Act will require paying passengers to execute waivers of liability with the
• The  Act  will  extend  the  existing  liability  indemnification  regime  to  commer-
cial  human  space  flight  launches,  but  the  bill  will  not  grant  indemnification
for  flights  conducted  under  experimental  permits,  which  will  be  more  lightly
regulated.

Chairman CALVERT. Good morning.
Pursuant  to  notice,  I  hereby  call  this  meeting  of  the  Space  and

Aeronautics Subcommittee to order.

Without  objection,  the  Chair  will  be  granted  authority  to  recess

the Committee at any time. Hearing no objections, so ordered.

Today,  we  are  going  to  examine  the  future  of  the  commercial
space  market.  We  are  going  to  have  two  panels.  The  first  will  ex-
amine  the  success  of  the  world’s  launch,  the  hopes  of  our  nascent
commercial  space  industry  that  led  to  a  robust  market  for  space
tourism.

Burt Rutan’s SpaceShipOne is a manned, reusable launch vehicle
that has successfully flown twice in two weeks carrying the equiva-
lent of three people. His team won the X–Prize in October, and last
night,  his  team  was  awarded  the  2005  Collier  Trophy,  congratula-
tions,  which  recognizes  those  who  have  made  the  most  significant
achievement in the advancement of aviation.

Joining him will be Will Whitehorn, President of Virgin Atlantic.
Virgin  Atlantic  will  be  buying  the  first  fleet  of  five  of  a  derivative
of these spaceships that takes space tourists into sub-orbital space.
On the second panel, we have Mr. Elon Musk, the CEO of Space
Exploration  Technologies,  or  SpaceX.  I  was  most  impressed  with
the  work  his  folks  are  doing  when  I  was  touring  his  facility  in  El
Segundo.  His  company  is  developing  a  new  family  of  launch  vehi-
cles, the Falcon. He will offer his insights on the business plan and
how  he  intends  to  emerge  as  a  success  in  this  commercial  space
business.

Also,  on  this  panel  will  be  Mr.  John  Vinter,  the  Chairman  of
International  Space  Brokers.  He  will  offer  guidelines  that  the  in-
surance community requires for those start-up companies and how
they  must  compete  with  the  established  aerospace  companies  for
insurance coverage.

Our  third  panelist  is  Mr.  Wolfgang  Demisch,  a  pre-eminent  ex-

pert and financial analyst in the aerospace industry.

And  finally  on  this  panel,  we  will  have  Dr.  Molly  Macauley,  a
Senior Fellow and Director of Academic Programs at the Resources
for  the  Future.  Dr.  Macauley  will  examine  what  the  government
should do or not do to encourage this start-up commercial space in-
dustry.  She  will  give  her  predictions  on  how  the  industry  will  look
in five to 10 years.

The  history  of  success  in  the  commercial  space  arena  has  been
spotty at best. Today, I want to see how the government can be an
enabler rather than a hindrance to this important, high technology
industry. I am proud of the bill that this committee was able to get
enacted last year, the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act,
which  Congressman  Rohrabacher  worked  very  hard  to  get  passed.
This  committee  has  had  a  history  of  interest  in  the  commercial
space  industry,  and  I  plan  to  continue  that  interest.  I  am  hoping
that  we  will  glean  information  today  that  will  be  valuable  as  we
put together our NASA authorization in the very near future.

I  look  forward  to  working  with  the  new  Administration,  Mike
Griffin,  on  this  objective.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  our  wit-
nesses today on this very important topic.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN KEN CALVERT

In  today’s  hearing,  we  are  going  to  examine  the  future  of  the  commercial  space
market.  We  are  going  to  have  two  panels.  The  first  will  examine  the  success  of  the
world’s  first  private  effort  to  launch  a  person  into  space  and  to  launch  the  hopes
of  our  nascent  commercial  space  industry  that  may  lead  to  a  robust  market  for
space tourism.

Burt  Rutan’s  SpaceShipOne  is  a  manned,  reusable  launch  vehicle  that  has  suc-
cessfully flown twice in two weeks carrying the equivalent of three people. Last Oc-
tober  his  team  won  the  privately-funded  $10  million  X–Prize  for  the  development
of the first private, manned spacecraft to exceed an altitude of 100 km twice in two
weeks,  and  last  night,  the  team  was  awarded  the  2005  Collier  Trophy,  an  annual
award that recognizes those that have made the most significant achievement in the
advancement of aviation.

Joining Mr. Rutan on this first panel will be Mr. Will Whitehorn, President of Vir-
gin Galactic. Virgin Galactic will be buying the inaugural ‘‘fleet’’ of up to five of the
derivative  vehicles  of  SpaceShipOne,  named  SpaceShipTwo.  We  are  very  interested
in  hearing  when  Virgin  Galactic  plans  to  take  ownership  and  when  they  expect  to
be flying tourists into sub-orbital space.

On  the  second  panel,  we  have  Mr.  Elon  Musk,  CEO  of  Space  Exploration  Tech-
nologies  or  SpaceX.  I  was  most  impressed  with  the  work  that  his  folks  were  doing
when  I  toured  his  facility  recently  in  El  Segundo,  CA.  His  company  is  developing
a  new  family  of  launch  vehicles—the  Falcon.  He  will  offer  his  insights  on  his  busi-
ness plan and how he intends to emerge as a success in this commercial space busi-
ness.

Also,  on  the  panel  will  be  Mr.  John  Vinter,  the  Chairman  of  International  Space
Brokers.  He  will  offer  guidelines  that  the  insurance  community  requires  for  those
start-up companies and how they must compete with the established aerospace com-
panies for insurance coverage.

Our  third  panelist  is  Mr.  Wolfgang  Demisch,  a  preeminent  expert  and  financial
analyst  of  the  aerospace  industry.  He  will  address  the  outlook  for  the  commercial
space  launch  industry  as  well  as  outline  when  space  is  likely  to  be  able  to  attract
classic risk-reward investors to succeed the ‘‘angel’’ investors that we see today.

And  finally,  Dr.  Molly  Macauley,  Senior  Fellow  and  Director  of  Academic  Pro-
grams  at  Resources  for  the  Future,  will  examine  what  the  government  should  do
or  not  do  to  encourage  this  start-up  commercial  space  industry.  She  will  also  give
her predictions on how the industry will look in five and ten years.

The  history  of  success  in  the  commercial  space  arena  has  been  spotty  at  best.
Today,  I  want  to  see  how  the  government  can  be  an  enabler,  rather  than  a  hin-
drance  to  this  important,  high  tech  industry.  This  committee  has  had  a  history  of
interest  in  the  commercial  space  industry  and  I  plan  to  continue  to  promote  com-
mercial  space.  I  am  hoping  that  we  will  glean  information  today  that  will  be  valu-
able as we put together our NASA Authorization in the very near future. I look for-
ward to working with the new NASA Administrator on this objective.

Chairman  CALVERT.  And  with  that,  good  morning,  Mr.  Udall.

You may proceed with your opening statement.

here.

Mr. UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And  good  morning  to  all  of  us  and  all  of  you  that  are  assembled

I want to welcome the witnesses as well, and particularly extend
my congratulations, as did Mr. Calvert, to Mr. Rutan and his team
on  winning  the  Collier  Trophy  for  their  efforts  on  SpaceShipOne.
This is a very prestigious and well-deserved award, and it puts Mr.
Rutan  in  distinguished  company,  including  Orville  Wright,  the
crew  of  Apollo  11  lunar  mission,  and  of  course  Mr.  Rutan  himself,
because  I  just  recently  learned  that  you  won  the  award  back  in
1986 as well. So congratulations. These are impressive accomplish-
ments, and I think I speak for all of us when I say we consider you
a  real  national  asset.  And  we  all  hope  you  keep  working  and  de-
signing for many years yet to come.

Mr.  Chairman,  as  you  know,  Congress,  and  this  committee  in
particular, has long had a strong interest in promoting the growth
of a healthy, robust commercial space sector.

Over the years, there have been some notable successes, such as
the  development  of  the  Nation’s  commercial  satellite  communica-
tions industry.

There have also been some setbacks.
For  example,  the  very  optimistic  projections  made  in  the  1980’s
for the emergence of manufacturing in space, solar power satellites,
and so forth, have not been realized.

And  finally,  there  are  the  commercial  space  transportation  and
commercial  satellite  remote  sensing  industries.  These  are  indus-
tries in which there has been growth over the years as well as the
promise  of  exciting  new  applications  and  markets  on  the  horizon.
At the same time, the current reality is that both of these indus-
tries  depend  significantly  on  government  contracts  to  maintain
their viability.

While  the  primary  focus  of  today’s  hearing  is  on  emerging  com-
mercial  space  transportation  initiatives,  I  hope  that  the  witnesses
will  share  their  thoughts  on  the  broader  issues  facing  all  commer-
cial space companies, whether they be entrepreneurial start-ups or
established companies fighting for market share.

The  question,  for  example,  of  what  helps  determine  whether  a
potential  commercial  space  activity  succeeds  or  fails,  and  what
should  government  be  doing,  as  the  Chairman  mentioned,  and
equally important, what should government refrain from doing if it
wants to promote a healthy commercial space sector.

In that regard, I have received some written testimony submitted
by  one  of  the  commercial  remote  sensing  companies,  DigitalGlobe,
that  addresses  some  of  those  broader  issues.  Mr.  Chairman,  I
would  ask  unanimous  consent  that  it  be  entered  into  the  record  of
this  hearing.  (See  Appendix  2:  Additional  Material  for  the  Record,
p. 84.)

Chairman CALVERT. Without objection, so ordered.
Mr. UDALL. And I want to thank you for convening this hearing,

and I look forward to hearing from the witnesses today.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MARK UDALL

Good morning. I want to join the Chairman in welcoming the witnesses to today’s
hearing.  And  I  would  also  like  to  extend  my  congratulations  to  Mr.  Rutan  and  his
team on winning the Collier Trophy for their efforts on Spaceship One.

Mr.  Rutan,  that  is  a  very  prestigious  and  well  deserved  award,  and  it  puts  you
in  very  distinguished  company,  including  Orville  Wright,  the  crew  of  the  Apollo  11
lunar  mission. . .and  of  course  Burt  Rutan. . .because  as  I  recently  learned,  you
had already won the Collier trophy for the first time back in 1986.

That’s  a  very  impressive  accomplishment,  and  I  consider  you  a  real  national

asset—I hope you keep working and designing for many years to come.

Mr.  Chairman,  as  you  know,  Congress—and  this  committee  in  particular—has
long had a strong interest in promoting the growth of a healthy, robust commercial
space sector.

Over the years, there have been some notable successes, such as the development

of Nation’s commercial satellite communications industry.

There have also been some setbacks.
For example, the very optimistic projections made in the 1980s for the emergence
of  manufacturing  in  space,  solar  power  satellites,  and  so  forth,  have  not  been  real-
ized.

And  finally,  there  are  the  commercial  space  transportation  and  commercial  sat-

ellite remote sensing industries.

Those  are  industries  in  which  there  has  been  growth  over  the  years,  as  well  as

the promise of exciting new applications and markets on the horizon.

At  the  same  time,  the  current  reality  is  that  both  of  these  industries  depend  sig-

nificantly on government contracts to maintain their viability. . .

While  the  primary  focus  of  today’s  hearing  is  on  emerging  commercial  space
transportation initiatives, I hope that the witnesses will share their thoughts on the
broader  issues  facing  all  commercial  space  companies—whether  they  be  entrepre-
neurial startups or established companies fighting for market share.

That is, what helps determine whether a potential commercial space activity suc-
ceeds  or  fails?  What  should  government  be  doing—and  equally  importantly—what
should  government  refrain  from  doing  if  it  wants  to  promote  a  healthy  commercial
space sector?

In  that  regard,  I  have  received  some  written  testimony  submitted  by  one  of  com-
mercial  remote  sensing  companies—DigitalGlobe—that  addresses  some  of  those
broader issues.

I  would  like  to  ask  unanimous  consent  that  it  be  entered  into  the  record  of  this
hearing. Well, Mr. Chairman, we have a wide range of issues to consider, and I look
forward to getting the perspectives of today’s witnesses. Thank you, and I yield back
the balance of my time.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
And  we  are  joined  by  Mr.  Rohrabacher,  the  former  Chairman  of
this  subcommittee.  Do  you  have  any  short  comment?  I  would  com-
ment  that  what  he  is  drinking  there,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  is  the
energy drink. It is——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. This is not beer.
I  figured  that  your  leadership,  Mr.  Chairman,  would  energize

me, but just in case, I brought Red Bull.

Chairman CALVERT. Well, it is appropriate that—at this hearing

that you have wings. So——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. All right.
Chairman CALVERT. Without objection, the additional statements
of  other  Members  will  be  put  in  the  written  record  so  we  can  get
right to the testimony.

Hearing no objection, so ordered.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON LEE

Chairman Calvert, Ranking Member Udall,

I  want  to  thank  you  for  organizing  this  important  Subcommittee  hearing  to  dis-
cuss  the  Future  Markets  for  Commercial  Space.  This  is  one  of  those  topics  where
we  realize  the  future  we  only  read  about  is  not  too  far  from  reality.  Commercial
space  encompasses  a  number  of  different  issues,  some  which  are  still  be  developed
and  others  that  have  been  an  integral  part  of  our  lives  for  quite  a  while  now.  The
only  way  to  advance  our  prospects  in  this  field  is  to  invest  in  R&D  and  put  our
knowledge and skills to use for improving the lives of people.

Space  tourism  is  a  subject  that  seems  like  science  fiction,  but  in  fact  that  fiction
is  now  close  to  being  reality.  SpaceShipOne,  the  world’s  first  privately-built  and
human-piloted  spacecraft  built  by  Burt  Rutan  shows  that  individuals  can  indeed
take  part  in  space  exploration.  Rutan’s  ship  was  the  first  to  fly  to  an  altitude  of
more than 100 kilometers, completing the feat twice in two weeks. Now, Virgin Ga-
lactic has announced plans to buy a fleet of spacecraft based on SpaceShipOne’s de-
sign to carry tourists into sub-orbital space. Clearly, the future is upon us, but real-
istically  it  will  be  many  years  before  regular  flights  into  space  for  individuals  will
be  possible.  Before  we  get  to  that  stage,  it  is  vital  that  we  discuss  all  aspects  of
what this kind of space exploration will entail.

First  among  our  priorities  must  be  the  issue  of  safety  for  those  who  would  take
part in such flights to space. In discussing NASA I have long said that safety must
be  the  first  priority,  now  with  the  prospect  of  average  citizens  being  propelled  into
space  the  issue  of  safety  is  even  more  paramount.  I  would  suggest  that  a  separate
commission  be  organized  to  discuss  the  safety  parameters  that  would  need  to  be  in
place  to  make  it  feasible  for  average  citizens  to  enter  space.  Clearly,  as  time  goes

on so will the technology that will steadily allow people to gain even greater access
to space exploration than is being proposed by Virgin Galactic. In accordance, guide-
lines  and  regulations  must  be  put  in  place  to  meet  the  risks  associated  with  such
travel.  We  may  be  entering  a  new  era  in  individual  travel,  but  just  like  the  pas-
senger airplane before it we must ensure the safety of all passengers.

In  regards  to  space  tourism,  it  is  also  my  belief  that  such  travel  should  not  be
restricted  to  only  the  wealthy.  Clearly,  these  businesses  make  large  investments  to
startup  such  a  complex  operation  and  therefore  huge  fees  must  be  generated  to
make  up  the  costs.  However,  those  who  have  a  passion  for  space  exploration;  espe-
cially  students  should  at  least  have  a  chance  to  experience  space  exploration.  Of
course, this could not be open to everyone, but even allowing a few individuals with
lower means but high motivation to take part would be a wise investment. I believe
in the long run this will be good for business and good for the science of space explo-
ration  because  it  will  only  increase  the  general  public’s  interest  in  space.  We  must
inspire a new generation to want to literally reach the stars, and with our new gen-
eration of technology this dream is more possible.

Commercial space has long yielded great dividends in the technology of satellites.
In  today’s  world  we  would  be  lost  and  confused  without  the  aid  of  these  stations
in space. However, new technology must emerge and the ability for more businesses
to  use  satellite  technology  must  be  enhanced.  Lowering  the  cost  of  producing  and
launching  commercial  satellites  would  go  a  long  way  in  bringing  new  business  and
therefore  new  revenue  streams  in  to  the  fold.  Together  with  space  tourism,  the  fu-
ture of commercial space is bright, but we can not relent in our pursuit of continued
development.  Only  when  we  continue  to  push  the  boundaries  of  discovery  do  we
yield innovations that affect the lives of everyday people.

Chairman  CALVERT.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  insert,  at  the
appropriate place in the record, the background memorandum pre-
pared by the majority staff for this hearing.

Hearing no objections, so ordered.
Today,  we  will  begin  with  our  first  panel:  Mr.  Rutan  and  Mr.

Mr.  Rutan,  thank  you  for  attending,  and  you  may  begin.  You

Panel I:

STATEMENT OF MR. BURT RUTAN, SCALED COMPOSITES, LLC
Mr.  RUTAN.  Okay.  Thank  you  very  much  for  the  opportunity  to

I  will  attempt  to  specifically  answer  the  questions  that  showed

address the hearing.

up in the invitation.

I want to first point out that I will use the words ‘‘personal space
flight’’  here.  We  tend  to  use  that  nowadays  instead  of  ‘‘space  tour-
ism.’’ And personal space flight is just access to flight above the at-
mosphere  by  the  public,  generally  inferred  that  it  is  a  commercial,
revenue-like business.

I  think  the  markets  for  personal  space  flight  will  take  on  two
basic scenarios. The first is one in which commercial companies de-
velop  lower-cost  versions  of  the  classic  government  booster  and
spacecraft  concepts  and  then  conduct  commercial  flights  that  are
funded  by  passenger  ticket  sales.  This  activity  might  properly  be
compared  to  trekking  outfits  that  take  courageous  adventurers  to
the top of Mount Everest. That activity survives today even though
more  than  nine  percent  of  those  who  have  reached  the  summit
have  died  on  the  mountain  and  with  the  recent  rate  still  at  four
percent.  The  safety  record  for  all  of  government  manned  space
flight is hardly better; four percent fatality rate for those who have
flown  above  the  atmosphere,  and  the  fatality  rate  for  government

14

space flight for the last 20 years has been much worse than it was
for the first 20 years.

This  first  scenario’s  approach  will  result  in,  I  think,  a  very  lim-
ited  market  whose  size  will  depend  somewhat  on  the  ticket  prices.
However, I do not believe this scenario will result in significant vol-
ume of operations, being limited by the same factors that limit the
Mount  Everest  climbers.  I  believe  these  systems  might  begin  com-
mercial  flight  in  four  to  six  years,  flying  maybe  50  to  100  astro-
nauts the first year, and I think the rate will top out at maybe 300
to 500 people per year.

The  second  scenario  is  quite  different.  It  is  a  scenario  in  which
the players do not find the dangers of space flight acceptable. They
recognize  that  extensive  improvements  in  safety  are  more  impor-
tant  than  extensive  improvements  in  affordability.  Those  that  at-
tack  the  problem  from  this  viewpoint  will  be  faced  with  a  much
greater  technical  challenge:  the  need  for  new  innovations  and
breakthroughs. If successful, however, they will enjoy an enormous
market,  not  one  that  is  limited  to  servicing  only  a  few  courageous
adventurers.  It  is  likely  that  systems  that  come  out  of  this  ap-
proach  will  be  more  like  airplanes  and  will  operate  more  like  air-
planes  than  the  historic  systems  that  are  used  for  government
manned space flight.

The future plans for my company regarding the new industry can
not  be  revealed  since  they  are  only  at  a  preliminary  stage  of  tech-
nical development. They are not fixed—excuse me.

Chairman CALVERT. I apologize.
Mr. RUTAN. No problem.
Chairman CALVERT. They will go off in a second.
Mr. RUTAN. They are not fixed in business deals and, in general,
the—when  we  approach  these  sort  of  things,  we  don’t  talk  about
them in the early years. So we are not ready to put out, in a public
forum,  the—any  details  on  our  plans.  I  could  share  that  with  you
privately, but not publicly.

I can assure you, however, that our plans do involve this—do not
involve  the  scenario  one  approach.  Since  we  believe  a  proper  goal
for safety is the record that was achieved during the first five years
of  commercial  scheduled  airline  service  started  in  1927.  The  first
five  years  of  commercial  airline  service,  while  exposing  passengers
to  risks  that  were  high  by  today’s  standards,  were  more  than  100
times  as  safe  as  government  manned  space  flight.  Achieving  that
goal  requires  new  generic  concepts,  ones  that  will  come  from  true
research,  not  development  programs  like  the  ones  we  are  seeing
with NASA’s exploration plans.

I can tell you that we do not yet have the breakthroughs that can
promise adequate safety and costs for manned orbital flights. That
is  why  our  early  focus  will  be  on  the  sub-orbital  personal  space
flight  industry.  Our  recent  SpaceShipOne  research  program  did
focus  on  the  needs  for  safety  breakthroughs  by  providing  an  air-
launched  operation  in  which  the  rocket  propulsion  is  not  safety
critical  and  the  ‘‘carefree  re-entry’’  concept  assures  that  flight  con-
trol  is  not  safety  critical  for  atmospheric  entry.  Those  are  biggies,
and  those  are  the  things  that  allow  us  to  move  into  a  commercial
industry in the short-term.

Another thing I can tell you is that our systems for the commer-
cial  private  space  flight  industry  will  be  focused  on  an  early  mar-
ketplace  with  multiple,  competing  spaceline  operators  in  order  to
bring  the  experience  to  the  largest  possible  audience.  The  airline
experience has shown us that it is not just technology that provides
safety,  but  the  maturity  that  comes  from  a  high  level  of  flight  ac-
tivity. Airline safety increased by a factor of six within the first five
years without an accompanying technology increase.

I  am  not  able  to  reveal  the  schedule  for  the  introduction  of  our
commercial systems. However, I believe that once revenue business
begins  with  these  new  systems,  it  will  likely  fly  as  many  as  500
astronauts  the  first  year,  by  the  fifth  year,  the  rate  will  increase
to about 3,000 astronauts per year, and by the twelfth year of oper-
ations, at least 50,000, maybe 100,000 astronauts will have enjoyed
that black sky view from sub-orbital flight.

Now  that  it  has  been  shown  that  a  small  private  company  can
indeed  conduct  robust,  sub-orbital  manned  flights  with  an  accept-
able  recurring  cost,  I  do  not  believe  that  this  industry  will  again
be hampered by the inability to raise capital. The size of the poten-
tial  market  supports  significant  investment.  The  main  barrier  has
been  the  perceived  risk  that  the  technical  problems  weren’t  solv-
able.  Those  that  develop  systems  that  have  generic  features  that
point  to  poor  safety  will  continue  to  have  trouble  finding  capital,
as  they  should.  Our  ability  to  find  funding  for  our  research  pro-
gram, the one that we completed last year, was certainly tied to the
fact that we had a goal of not just to fly in space, but to fly a sys-
tem  that  could  be  immediately  developed  for  the  commercial  mar-
ket.  We  have  had  no  problem  finding  investors  for  our  future  pro-
gram, a program that involves the development and certification of
commercial sub-orbital spaceships.

I believe the ability to insure will be greatly improved if the gov-
ernment  steps  up  to  the  responsibility  to  require  an  operator  to
show  his  passenger  safety  by  adequate  flight  and  ground  testing.
Clearly,  insurance  will  be  expensive  until  it  is  shown  that  the  ag-
gressive  safety  goals  are  indeed  being  achieved.  With  maturity,
that safety will continuously improve, as it did with airliners.

Over  the  last  33  years,  my  companies  have  developed  39  dif-
ferent manned aircraft types. All were developed via research flight
tests flown over our California desert area, and all flights were reg-
ulated  by  the  FAA-AVR,  which  is  now—the  airplane  folk  are  who
I  am  talking  about,  now  AVS.  We  have  never  injured  a  test  pilot
nor  put  the  non-involved  public  or  their  property  at  risk.  In  spite
of  that  record,  the  FAA  insisted  that  the  Office  of  Commercial
Space Transportation, AST, impose their commercial launch license
process  on  our  last  five  flights  of  our  88-flight  research-only  test
program. That would have been fine, except that their process bore
no relation to that historically used for research testing.

The  AST  process,  focusing  only  on  the  non-involved  public,  just
about ruined my program. It resulted in cost overruns. It increased
the  risk  for  my  test  pilots.  It  did  not  reduce  the  risk  to  the  non-
involved  public.  It  destroyed  our  safety  policy  of  always  question
the product, never defend it. And under AST, it removed the oppor-
tunities  for  us  to  seek  new  innovative  safety  solutions.  The  main
reason  for  this  is  that  AST,  with  their  history  of  only  regulating

the  dangerous  scenario  one  type  of  systems,  applied  the  process  of
protecting  only  the  non-involved  and  had  no  process  to  deal  with
the safety and prediction of failure for manned aircraft. Their proc-
ess  deals  primarily  with  the  consequence  of  failure,  where  the  air-
plane  folk,  their  regulatory  process  deals  with  reducing  the  prob-
ability of failure.

The  regulatory  process  was  grossly  misapplied  for  our  research
tests, and worse yet is likely to be misapplied for the regulation of
future  commercial  spaceliners.  The  most  dangerous  misapplication
might  be  stifling  innovation  by  imposing  standards  and  design
guidelines  rather  than  the  aircraft  certification  process  that  in-
volves requiring a manufacturer to test to show his safety margins.
AST  has  already  used  NASA  and  AIAA  to  develop  design  guide-
lines. This is an approach that must not be imposed on an industry
that  is  still  doing  basic  research.  The  AST  launch  license  process
might  be  applicable  for  the  protection  of  those  on  the  ground  dur-
ing flights of scenario one-like systems, but it will not work for the
portion of the industry that promises growth and sustainability.

Time  here  does  not  allow  me  to  elaborate  on  that,  but  I  do  have

it included in my handout.

The  basic  problem  faced  by  the  FAA  in  dealing  with  the  regu-
latory tasks ahead is funding for hiring staff that are familiar with
aircraft  certification  and  aircraft  commercial  operations.  The  FAA
Administrator  has  told  me  that  she  is  300  people  short  needed  for
the current demands in regulating aircraft, thus it is impossible to
shift  the  job  of  regulation  of  spacecraft,  like  mine,  to  the  aircraft
organization. I think it needs to be shifted to people who know how
to regulate the systems that are being developed.

This problem must be solved quickly to support an industry that
needs  a  proper  research  environment  to  allow  innovation.  The
problem  can  not  be  solved  by  adding  staff  at  AST,  since  having
more people applying the wrong process is not the answer. I believe
they  are  over-staffed  now  to  do  the  current  launch  license  process.
Much  of  the  work  done  in  an  attempt  to  misapply  the  expendable
booster  process  to  our  aircraft  was  repeated  numerous  times  with
a  staff  that  were  not  equipped  to  make  relatively  easy  decisions
and incapable of applying the needed waiver process. In fact, while
my  company  was  already  flying  initial  test  flights  and  waiting  for
time-critical responses from AST during 2003 and 2004, AST found
time  to  expend  extensive  resources  processing  and  awarding  a
launch  license  to  a  company  that  did  not  even  have  a  vehicle  in
construction, nor even funding for the program.

We  have  spent  considerable  resources  developing  recommenda-
tions  for  specific  regulatory  processes  to  be  applied  to  the  new  in-
dustry,  that  is  a  streamlined  like  certification  for  these  new  com-
mercial  spaceships,  but  we  have  not  yet  found  interest  within  the
FAA  to  consider  them.  We  will  continue  our  work  to  solve  this
problem and will hope to make progress within the next two years.
I  want  to  point  out  also,  this  sub-orbital  space  tourism  industry
has been criticized by some as, well, this is just joyrides for billion-
aires  and  that—what  is  this  all  about?  It  is  about  fun.  I  want  to
tell  this  group  that  I  am  not  at  all  embarrassed  that  we  are  open-
ing  up  a  new  industry  that  will  likely  be  a  multi-billion-dollar  in-
dustry  that  is  focused  only  on  fun.  I  want  to  remind  you,  I—when

we bought personal computers in the late ’70s, a lot of people—you
know,  many  thousands  of  people  bought  these  things,  and  what
were  they  for?  Balancing  our  checkbook?  Well,  in  general,  they
were  for  fun.  The  vast  majority  of  uses  on  them  were  to  play
games.  And  the  fact  that  it  expanded  as  an  industry  and  of  some-
thing that we really didn’t know what they were for, it left it wide
open for somebody like Al Gore to come along and invent the Inter-
net.  And  then,  all  of  a  sudden,  the  fact  that  it  is  out  there,  all  of
a sudden now here is an application, and the application is now our
communication,  it  is  our  commerce,  it  is  our,  essentially,  every-
thing. And that was an industry in which the product was sold for
a full decade just for fun. And I believe this is going to happen with
space  flying,  also.  I  am  not  embarrassed  that  the  first  decade  of
personal  space  flight  will  be  for  nothing  but  fun.  But  I  am  con-
fident that when there are 50,000 people that have left the atmos-
phere, and when there is a lot of capital investment on it, because
it  is  profitable,  all  of  a  sudden  we  will  get  out  there  and  we  will
solve  the  reasons  to  make  it  also  safe  to  go  to  orbit  and  to  go  to
the  moon.  And  we  will  also  find  out  new  uses  for  it.  There  will  be
somebody  that  comes  along  and  invent  an  Internet-like  reason  for
changing  this  fun  into  something  that  is  long  lasting  and  signifi-
cant for our Nation.

Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Rutan follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF BURT RUTAN

Thank  you  for  the  invitation  to  address  this  important  hearing.  I  will  attempt  to

specifically address the subjects outlined in the invitation.

The  markets  for  a  future  Personal  Space  Flight  industry  (access  to  flight  above
the atmosphere by the public) will likely take on two basic forms: The first is a sce-
nario in which commercial companies develop lower-cost versions of the classic gov-
ernment  booster  and  spacecraft  concepts  and  then  conduct  commercial  flights  that
are  funded  by  passenger  ticket  sales.  This  activity  might  properly  be  compared  to
the  trekking  outfits  that  take  courageous  adventurers  to  the  top  of  Mount  Everest;
the activity survives even though more than nine percent of those who have reached
the  summit  have  died  on  the  mountain,  with  the  recent  rate  still  at  four  percent.
The  safety  record  for  all  of  government  manned  space  flight  is  hardly  better;  four
percent  fatality  for  those  who  have  flown  above  the  atmosphere,  and  the  fatality
rate  for  the  last  20  years  being  much  worse  than  the  first  20  years.  This  first  sce-
nario’s  approach  will  result  in  a  very  limited  market  whose  size  will  depend  some-
what  on  the  ticket  prices.  However,  I  do  not  believe  this  scenario  will  result  in  a
significant volume of operations, being limited by the same factors that limit the Ev-
erest climbers. I believe these systems might begin commercial flights in four to six
years  flying  maybe  50  to  100  astronauts  the  first  year  with  the  rate  topping  out  at
maybe 300 to 500 per year.

The  second  is  a  scenario  in  which  the  players  do  not  find  the  dangers  of  space
flight acceptable and recognize that extensive improvements in safety are more im-
portant than extensive improvements in affordability. Those that attack the problem
from this viewpoint will be faced with a much greater technical challenge; the need
for  new  innovations  and  breakthroughs.  If  successful,  however,  they  will  enjoy  an
enormous market, not one that is limited to servicing only a few courageous adven-
turers. It is likely that systems that come from this approach will be more like air-
planes  and  will  operate  more  like  airplanes  than  the  historic  systems  used  for  gov-
ernment manned space flight.

The  future  plans  for  my  company  regarding  the  new  industry  cannot  be  revealed
since  they  are  only  at  a  preliminary  stage  of  technical  development.  I  can  assure
you  that  they  do  not  involve  a  ‘scenario  one’  approach,  since  we  believe  a  proper
goal for safety is the record that was achieved during the first five years of commer-
cial scheduled airline service which, while exposing the passengers to high risks by
today’s  standards,  was  more  than  100  times  as  safe  as  government  manned  space
flight.  Achieving  that  goal  requires  new  generic  concepts;  ones  that  will  come  from

true  research,  not  merely  development  programs  like  the  ones  we  are  seeing  with
NASA’s exploration plans.

I  can  tell  you  that  we  do  not  yet  have  the  breakthroughs  that  can  promise  ade-
quate  safety  and  cost  for  manned  orbital  flights.  That  is  why  our  early  focus  will
be  on  the  sub-orbital  Personal  Space  Flight  industry.  Our  recent  SpaceShipOne  re-
search program did focus on the needs for safety breakthroughs by providing an air-
launched  operation  in  which  the  rocket  propulsion  is  not  safety  critical  and  the
‘care-free re-entry’ concept assures that flight control is not safety critical for atmos-
pheric entry.

Another thing I can tell you is that our systems for the commercial Private Space
Flight  industry  will  be  focused  on  an  early  marketplace  with  multiple,  competing
spaceline operators in order to bring the experience to the largest possible audience.
The airline experience has shown us that it is not just technology that provides safe-
ty,  but  the  maturity  that  comes  from  a  high  level  of  flight  activity.  Airline  safety
increased by a factor of six within the first five years without an accompanying tech-
nology increase. I am not able to reveal the schedule for the introduction of our com-
mercial  systems.  However,  I  believe  that  once  the  revenue  business  begins  it  will
likely  fly  as  many  as  500  astronauts  the  first  year.  By  the  fifth  year  the  rate  will
increase  to  about  3,000  astronauts  per  year  and  by  the  twelfth  year  of  operations
50,000 to 100,000 astronauts will have enjoyed that black sky view.

Now that it has been shown that a small private company can indeed conduct ro-
bust,  sub-orbital  manned  flights  with  an  acceptable  recurring  cost,  I  do  not  believe
that this industry will again be hampered by the inability to raise capital. The size
of the potential market supports significant investment. The main barrier had been
the perceived risk that the technical problems were not solvable. Those that develop
systems  that  have  generic  features  that  point  to  poor  safety  will  continue  to  have
trouble  finding  capital,  as  they  should.  Our  ability  to  find  funding  for  our  research
program  was  certainly  tied  to  the  fact  that  we  had  a  goal  of  not  just  to  fly,  but  to
fly  a  system  that  could  immediately  be  developed  for  the  commercial  market.  We
have had no problem finding investors for our future program that involves the de-
velopment and certification of commercial sub-orbital spaceships.

I  believe  the  ability  to  insure  will  be  greatly  improved  if  the  government  steps
up to the responsibility to require an operator to show his passenger safety by ade-
quate  flight  and  ground  testing.  Clearly,  insurance  will  be  expensive  until  it  is
shown  that  aggressive  safety  goals  are  indeed  being  achieved.  With  maturity  I  ex-
pect that safety will continuously improve, as it did with airliners.

Over the last 33 years my companies have developed 39 different manned aircraft

five flights of our 88-flight research test program. That would have been fine, except
that their process bore no relation to that historically used for research testing. The
AST  process,  focusing  only  on  the  non-involved  public,  just  about  ruined  my  pro-
gram.  It  resulted  in  cost  overruns,  increased  the  risk  for  my  test  pilots,  did  not  re-
duce  the  risk  to  the  non-involved  public,  destroyed  our  ‘‘always  question,  never  de-
fend’’ safety policy, and removed our opportunities to seek new innovative safety so-
lutions.  The  main  reason  for  this  is  that  AST,  with  their  history  of  only  regulating
the  dangerous  ‘scenario  one’  type  of  systems,  applied  the  process  of  protecting  only
the non-involved and had no process to deal with the safety and prediction of failure
for  manned  aircraft.  Their  process  deals  primarily  with  the  consequence  of  failure,
where  the  aircraft  regulatory  process  deals  with  reducing  the  probability  of  failure.
The regulatory process was grossly misapplied for our research tests, and worse-yet
is  likely  to  be  misapplied  for  the  regulation  of  the  future  commercial  spaceliners.
The most dangerous misapplication might be stifling innovation by imposing stand-
ards  and  design  guidelines,  rather  than  the  aircraft  certification  process  that  in-
volves  testing  to  show  safety  margins.  AST  has  already  used  NASA  and  AIAA  to
develop  design  guidelines.  This  is  an  approach  that  must  not  be  imposed  on  an  in-
dustry that is still doing research. The AST launch license process might be applica-
ble for the protection of those on the ground during flights of ‘‘scenario one’’ systems,
but  it  will  not  work  for  the  portion  of  the  industry  that  promises  growth  and  sus-
tainability.  Time  here  does  not  allow  elaboration,  so  I  must  refer  you  to  the  hand-
out.

A  basic  problem  faced  by  the  FAA  in  dealing  with  the  regulatory  tasks  ahead  is

lation  of  spacecraft  like  mine  for  ‘‘scenario  two’’  to  the  aircraft  organization  (AVS)
who  will  know  how  to  regulate  the  systems  being  developed.  This  problem  must  be
solved quickly to support an industry that needs a proper research test environment
to allow innovation. The problem cannot be solved by adding staff at AST, since hav-

are  over  staffed,  to  do  the  current  launch  license  process.  Much  of  the  work  done

sources  processing  and  awarding  a  launch  license  to  a  company  that  did  not  even
have a vehicle in construction, or even funding for the project!

We  have  spent  considerable  resources  developing  recommendations  for  specific
regulatory processes to be applied to the new industry, but have not yet found inter-
est within the FAA to consider them. We will continue our work to solve this prob-
lem and will hope to make progress within the next two years.

your questions.

REGULATION OF MANNED SUB-ORBITAL SPACE SYSTEMS

FOR RESEARCH AND COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS

A summary prepared by Burt Rutan, Scaled Composites

Safety Requirements for the Private Spaceline Industry

• New generic solutions for safety as compared to historic Government manned

space operations will be mandatory

• Cannot run a Spaceline without a huge reduction of current risk

Safety Goals: Airline experience as a model

• Risk statistics, fatal risk per flight

• First 44 years of manned space flight = one per 62 flights
• First airliners (1927 & 1928) = one per 5,500 flights
• Early airliners (1934 to 1936) = one per 31,000 flights
• Current airliners = one per two to five million flights
• Modern military fighters = one mishap per 33,000 flights

• Logical goal:

• Better than the first airliners
• < one percent of the historic government space flight risk

Different Systems Need Different Regulation Methods

• The AST Process

• To  show  that  the  consequence  of  failure,  i.e.,  the  expectation  of  casualty

(Ec) for the non-involved public (NIP) is low.

• Deals with systems that are historically dangerous.

• The AVR (now AVS) Process

• To show that the probability of failure (Pf) is low.
• Assures safety of crew and passengers.
• Deals with systems that need to be reliable.

• The risk method approach by AST

• Risk is product of failure probability and consequence.
• NIP  risk  with  dangerous  systems  is  assured  only  by  selection  of  flight

• Flight  crew  risk  with  dangerous  systems  can  be  addressed  only  by  flight

area.

• However,  since  Pf  cannot  be  calculated  for  immature  systems,  AST  has
no  acceptable  process  for  new  systems  that  have  to  be  safe  enough  for
commercial passenger service.

• AST Methods for Booster-like systems

• Computer-flown or remote operation
• Automation that requires backup via flight-termination systems
• Ground-launched
• Safety-critical rocket propulsion
• Un-piloted stages dropped
• High-scatter landing

• AVR Methods for Aircraft-like systems

• Human Piloted flight
• Expendable-like flight-termination systems are not appropriate
• Runway takeoff
• Rocket propulsion not safety critical
• No ‘‘bombing’’ of hardware that presents risk to NIP
• Horizontal aircraft-like runway recovery

• If  the  safety  approach  is  based  on  failure  consequence  it  should  be  regulated

• If  the  safety  approach  is  based  on  failure  probability  it  should  be  regulated

by AVR or by staff experienced in aircraft safety assurance.

• If  safety  is  based  on  both  consequence  and  vehicle  reliability,  then  con-
sequence should be calculated by AST, but Pf must be accessed by those with
aircraft safety regulation experience.

by AST.

Experimental Research Testing of Airplane-like Systems

• Cannot  be  addressed  by  enforcing  standards  or  guidelines—the  important
need  is  to  allow  innovation;  to  seek  safety  breakthroughs  without  regulatory
hurdles. Regulators must not be expected to appreciate this need during a re-
search test environment.

• Pf  cannot  be  calculated,  thus  historic  data  must  be  a  guide  for  approval  of

an adequate test area to meet Ec intent for NIP.

• Environmental requirements, like for aircraft are not needed, but they can be

tolerated, with costs not the full burden of the developer.

• The AVR waiver method for all regulations is mandatory. The developer must
be  able  to  argue  the  equivalent  safety  justification  for  non-compliance  to  any
regulation.  This  is  critical,  especially  for  an  immature  industry  with  indeter-
minate technical issues.

• The  AST  launch  licensing  process  is  not  acceptable  due  to  its  costs,  its  hin-
drance  of  innovation  and  its  negative  effect  on  safety  policy.  The  AVR-EAC
(Experimental  Airworthiness  Certificate)  method  works  and  must  be  imple-
mented.  The  system  is  based  on  respect  for  a  developer’s  safety  record  and
the expectation that he will follow the license rules.

Certification,  or  Licensing  Spacecraft  for  Commercial  Sub-orbital  Pas-

senger Operations

• The  manufacturer  and  the  operator  cannot  accept  a  scenario  in  which  the
FAA has no role in approving the safety of crews or passengers. His responsi-
bility to do adequate testing to assure passenger safety must have acceptance
by the FAA. Otherwise he has no unbiased defense at trial following an acci-
dent.

• Part  23  &  25  Certification  are  based  on  defining  conformity.  Then,  by  test
and  analysis  showing  adequate  margins  for  the  conformed  vehicle.  Subse-
quently  the  holder  of  the  certificate  can  then  produce  and  operate  unlimited
numbers  of  vehicles  that  conform.  The  main  costs  of  certification  are  the
issues related to conformity, not the specific tests to show margins.

• Any ethical manufacturer or operator must test to show margins, even in the

absence of any government regulation.

21

• However, initially the manufacturer and operator will build and operate only
a very small number of vehicles, thus making the detailed conformity process
debilitating.  Also,  the  intensity  of  the  process  would  interfere  with  the  need
to  solve  new  technical  problems  and  to  maintain  a  ‘‘question,  never  defend’’
posture while system technical status is not mature.

• Our proposal: an applicant seeking approval to fly passengers will be required
to define the tests needed to show adequate margins for his design and define
the  required  systems  safety  analysis.  He  must  then  obtain  acceptance  of  the
test plan by FAA regulators and later get acceptance that the tests were sat-
isfactorily completed. The process will be design specific and repeated for each
flight article.

• Conformity of the design, the tools, the systems or the manufacturing process

will not be required.

• A  manufacturer  can  select  the  conformity  process  as  an  option  if  he  desires

to avoid the individual tests of each production article.

• Conformity may be mandatory after the industry matures (the aircraft certifi-

cation process).

Lessons  from  the  Regulatory  Process  During  the  SpaceShipOne  (SS1)  Re-

search Flight Tests

• The  Tier1  test  program  involved  88  flights,  17  for  the  SS1  and  71  for  the
White Knight. 83 of those flights were licensed via an AVR–AIR–200 Experi-
mental Airworthiness Certificate. Those flights were done under the authority
of the EAC and directed via the information in its Operating Limitations list.
The EAC was in effect for the duration of the program, July 2002 to October
2004.

• Five  flights  of  SS1  were  flown  under  the  additional  authority  of  an  AST

Launch License. License was in effect from March 2004 to October 2004.

• The 83 flights flown under the EAC involved the highest risk, both to the pi-
lots  and  the  NIP:  first  flights  of  unproven  vehicles  and  nearly  all  envelope
expansion, including first supersonic flight of SS1 to max-q.

• The  EAC  flights  were  regulated  similar  to  the  1,800  research  flights  con-
ducted by Scaled on 36 aircraft types over a 30-year period: we were expected
to  fly  within  the  Ops  Limits  list,  and  were  trusted  to  do  so.  The  program  al-
lowed  the  innovation  always  present  in  aircraft  research,  and  did  not  inter-
fere with our ‘question, never defend’ safety policy.

• Development  of  the  new  safety  innovations  were  done  under  the  EAC:  the
new  type  hybrid  rocket  motor,  the  air  launch  and  the  ‘care-free  re-entry’
feathered concept.

• The  EAC  process  provided  an  efficient  environment  for  exploratory  testing

and continued the historic research aircraft record of safety for the NIP.

• The AST Launch License process enforced on the remaining five flights of SS1
was  a  very  different  regulatory  environment.  We  were  assured  streamlining
from  the  certifications  needed  for  commercial  operations  approvals  but  were
kept  in  the  dark  on  specifics.  The  process  involved  a  15  month,  three  party
Ec  analysis  that  failed  to  arrive  at  an  adequate  calculation  for  Pf,  thus  ren-
dering the Ec determination to be useless. The process was misguided and in-
appropriate, at times resembling a type certification effort and left the appli-
cant without the basic information needed to determine status. The regulators
requested Ec analysis, then ignored those results without informing the appli-
cant  or  allowing  him  to  defend,  to  revise  or  to  resubmit  the  data.  The  regu-
lators  refused  to  reveal  the  government’s  analysis  method  for  Ec  calculation.
The ‘shell game’ continued for the majority of the program, resulting in a se-
vere  distraction  to  key  test  personnel  as  well  as  high  costs  and  a  disregard
for our safety policy. The environment also precluded innovation.

• The  Launch  License  process,  as  applied  to  the  aircraft  research  test  environ-
ment resulted in increased risk for our flight crews, the very people that bear
the true risk in experimental flight tests.

• The AST office had no waiver policy, and answered our requests by a written
denial  from  the  Administrator  without  giving  the  applicant  the  opportunity
to  debate  or  negotiate  the  technical  merits  or  to  get  an  opinion  from  the
EAC’s regulatory staff.

Conclusions

22

• An  applicant  for  approval  to  fly  research  flight  tests  of  piloted,  aircraft-like
systems  must  have  a  defined  process,  one  that  allows  him  to  plan  his  pro-
gram  staffing  and  financial  needs.  It  is  not  acceptable  to  impose  undefined,
inappropriate  forced  oversight.  The  specific  EAC  process  has  served  the  in-
dustry well for decades and should be used and enforced by regulators famil-
iar with research aircraft testing.
• The  Ec  process,  developed  for  protection  of  population  from  the  dangers  of
ground-launched,  expendable  rocket  boosters,  is  not  workable  for  application
to  piloted,  aircraft-like  systems  during  research  tests  and  must  be  replaced
by  the  AVR  method  of  having  test-experienced  regulators  select  an  appro-
priate  flight  test  area  for  research  tests.  The  Ec  process  might  be  justifiable
for commercial operations, but it must be regulated by those experienced with
commercial aircraft operations.
• Regarding  licenses  to  conduct  commercial  flights  that  carry  revenue  pas-
sengers,  it  is  not  acceptable  for  FAA  to  ignore  the  approval  or  acceptance  of
the  vehicle’s  ability  to  safely  fly  people.  Regulation  must  be  done  by  experi-
enced (aircraft experienced) staff.
• The acceptance of the system’s probable safety can be done via a vehicle-spe-
cific  test  requirement  process  for  structures  and  safety  analysis  for  systems,
rather  than  the  more  expensive  Type  Certification  process  that  includes  full
conformity assurance. These processes cannot be defined in advance by speci-
fication  of  standards  or  by  design  guidelines,  since  every  new  system  will
have unique features. The testing details and systems safety analysis process
must  be  specific  to  the  vehicle  and  its  intended  operation.  This  process  does
not  have  to  be  significantly  more  expensive  than  that  which  would  be  done
by any ethical manufacturer in the absence of government regulation.

BIOGRAPHY FOR BURT RUTAN

Burt Rutan was born in 1943. He received his Bachelor of Science degree in Aero-
nautical Engineering at California Polytechnic University in 1965. His education in-
cludes  the  Space  Technology  Institute  at  Cal  Tech  and  the  Aerospace  Research  Pi-
lot’s  School  at  Edwards  Air  Force  Base.  Mr.  Rutan  holds,  in  addition,  the  honorary
degree  of  Doctor  of  Science  from  California  Polytechnic  State  University,  San  Luis
Obispo, June 1987; Doctoral of Science, honoris causa, from Daniel Webster College,
May 1987; Doctoral of Humanities, honoris causa, from Lewis University, May 1988
and  Doctorate  of  Technology,  honoris  causa,  from  Delft  University  of  Technology,
January 1990.

Mr.  Rutan  worked  for  the  U.S.  Air  Force  from  1965  until  1972  as  Flight  Test
Project  Engineer  at  Edwards  Air  Force  Base,  California.  His  projects  ranged  from
fighter spin tests to the XC–142 VSTOL transport.

In March 1972, Mr. Rutan became Director of the Bede Test Center for Bede Air-

craft in Newton, Kansas.

In June of 1974, at Mojave, California, Mr. Rutan formed the Rutan Aircraft Fac-
tory  (RAF)  to  develop  light  homebuilt  aircraft.  Through  this  company,  the
VariViggen,  VariEze,  NASA  AD–1,  Quickie,  Defiant,  Long-EZ,  Grizzly,  scaled  NGT
trainer, Solitaire, Catbird, and the world-flight Voyager aircraft were developed.

In April 1982, Mr. Rutan founded Scaled Composites (Scaled) to develop research
aircraft.  Since  its  founding,  Scaled  has  been  the  world’s  most  productive  aerospace
prototype development company, developing new aircraft types at a rate of one each
year.  Past  projects  include  the  85  percent  scale  Starship  1  for  Beech  Aircraft  Cor-
poration,  the  Predator  agricultural  aircraft  for  ATAC,  the  Scarab  Model  324  recon-
naissance drone for Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical, the Advanced Technology Tactical
Transport (ATTT) for DARPA, the 1988 America’s Cup wing sail, the Triumph light
executive  jet  for  Beechcraft,  the  ARES  close  air  support  attack  turbofan,  the  Pond
Racer,  the  Pegasus  Space  launch  vehicle  flying  surfaces,  the  Model  191  general
aviation  single  for  Toyota,  a  40  percent  scale  B–2  bomber  RCS  model,  General  Mo-
tor’s 1992 show car (the GM Ultralite), the Bell Eagle Eye prototype tilt rotor RPV,
the  Earthwinds  pressurized  gondola,  the  McDonnell  Douglas  DC–X  single  stage
rocket  structure,  the  VisionAire  Vantage  business  jet,  the  Raptor  and  Raptor  D–2
high altitude RPVs for BMDO, a 40-meter wind generator for Zond, three NASA X–
38 crew return vehicles, the Williams, International V–Jet II, the high-altitude Pro-
teus  aircraft,  the  Adam  Model  309  business  aircraft,  and  the  Rotary  Rocket  Roton
atmospheric  test  vehicle.  Recent  projects 
include  the  White  Knight  and
SpaceShipOne.  On  21  June  2004,  with  Mike  Melvill  at  the  controls,  SS1  flew  his-

tory’s first private manned space flight. On 4 Oct 2004, SS1 won the $10M X–Prize
(two flights within five days flown by Melvill and Brian Binnie). The Virgin Atlantic
GlobalFlyer designed and built at Scaled made its maiden flight in March 2004 and
a record setting solo world flight in March 2005.

STATEMENT OF MR. WILL WHITEHORN, PRESIDENT, VIRGIN

GALACTIC

Mr. WHITEHORN. Thank you very much, Chairman Calvert.
Can  I  first  of  all  start  by  moving  slightly  away  from  my  testi-
mony and express my total agreement with Burt Rutan’s last com-
ment  there  with  regards  to  the  reasons  why  personal  space  flight,
as a concept, is incredibly important?

Our  belief  at  Virgin  Galactic  is  that  the  proof  of  concept  in  cre-
ating  a  profitable  business  in  the  private  sector  without  govern-
ment  funding  to  take  individuals  into  space  to  experience  the
blackness of space, the curvature of the Earth, weightlessness, and
all of the attendant things that they will feel and experience during
their two-hour trip to space is not just about fun. It is certainly not
all  about  fun  for  us.  We  see  this  is  as  a  proof  of  concept,  proof  of
the  idea  that  it  is  possible  to  develop  viable,  reusable  space  sys-
tems that can be safe in their operation.

As  a  major  airline  group  operating  three  airlines  around  the
world,  Virgin  Atlantic  and  its  sister  companies  have  not  taken
lightly the idea of venturing into the personal space flight market.
There has been a lot of handling over the issue internally, because
we  have  a  worldwide  brand  and  a  reputation,  and  we  have  a  rep-
utation  for  safety  in  the  commercial  airline  industry,  which  is  sec-
ond  to  none.  In  the  20  years  we  have  been  operating,  we  have  not
lost a single passenger. We also operate one of the largest rail net-
works in Europe operating high technology tilting trains, which are
a  new  technology  to  the  UK  market.  And  we  carry  50  million  pas-
sengers  a  year  in  that  business,  and  we  haven’t  had  a  single  acci-
dent or incident involving the death of a passenger on board.

And for us, the principle of entering this is the principle of prov-
ing  a  concept,  proving  that  something  can  be  done  in  the  private
sector, can be done safely, and through the personal space flight ex-
perience  of  the  pioneers  who  do  pay  at  the  beginning  of  this  proc-
ess,  we  believe  within  five  years  we  can  create  a  viable  business,
which will be profitable, and that would allow us to bring down the
costs  of  personal  space  flight  to  levels  which  would  be  affordable
across the board in the United States and around the world.

through 

the  process  of  completing 

I will move on now to talk a little bit about some of the questions
that  the  Subcommittee  put  to  us.  You  asked  us  about  a  timetable,
and I think my answer to the issue of the timetable is pretty simi-
lar  to  Burt  Rutan’s.  The  timetable  for  us  depends  upon  the  ability
to  go 
the  design  of
SpaceShipTwo,  as  we  will  call  it  for  the  purposes  of  today,  and
proving  and  testing  the  vehicle.  For  us,  the  issues  of  coming  to  a
contract  with  Mr.  Rutan’s  company  to  build  SpaceShipTwo  are
bound  up  in  a  number  of  issues  of  bureaucracy,  which  we  are  not
unhappy  about.  We  believe  we  can  cope  with  them.  We  have  got
the Defense Department and the DDTC to deal with over the issue
of  technology  transfer.  And  that  is  a  process  which  has  to  be  com-
pleted  before  we  can  complete  the  design  work  with  Burt  Rutan’s
company  and  move  towards  a  final  contract  to  construct  a  fleet  of
space ships.

But  an  outline,  our  view  of  the  issue  is  that  we  would  like  to
order  at  least  five  SpaceShipTwos,  as  we  will  call  it  for  the  pur-
poses of today, from Mr. Rutan’s company, and we would like to be
in  operation  before  the  end  of  this  decade.  And  we  would  like  to
be going through a testing process by the end of 2007 and commer-
cial  operation  by  2008,  if  that  was  possible.  But  we  can  not  allow
ourselves  to  be  dictated  to  by  a  commercial  need.  The  most  impor-
tant  factor  for  us  will  be  developing  a  safe  vehicle  and  operating
that vehicle safely. And if that can be proved, then we believe that
we can take the people into space and the people want to go.

To  give  you  an  example  of  where  we  believe  the  marketplace  is
for  commercial  space  tourism,  we  announced  the  formation  of  Vir-
gin Galactic formally before the X–Prize flights last September, and
we,  at  that  state,  set  up  the  marketing  operation  to  market  the
flights.  We  have,  since  we  set  up,  had  29,000  applications  to  fly.
That  is  29,000  people  who  said  they  are  willing  to  pay  a  deposit
of  up  to  $20,000  for  space  flights  within  a  range  of  prices  of  up  to
$200,000.  We  have  also  had  100  people  who  have  actually  signed
terms and conditions with us now to pay the full cost of a $200,000

flight  up  front  in  order  to  fly  in  SpaceShipTwo,  should  that  be  de-
veloped. Clearly, if we fail to develop a viable vehicle, they will get
their money back.

And  moving  on  to  some  of  the  other  questions  that  you  asked,
and the question of profitability for us is a very important one. We
are not doing this as a rich billionaire’s toy adventure and as a loss
leader  or  just  as  a  grand  representation.  We  are  doing  this  to  cre-
ate a profitable and viable business to prove a concept. And we be-
lieve  that  if  the  initial  work  that  we  have  done  on  the  business
plan  can  be  met,  that  this  business  can  be  profitable  within  five
years, and the cost of space flights could fall by a factor of 75 per-
cent by the end of that five-year period. And the pioneers, who are
going to be the pioneer astronauts who pay to fly commercially into
space,  will  help  to  fund  the  process  of  making  commercially  viable
personal space flight something that people across the country can
enjoy and afford in the future.

And  you  asked  one  of  the  questions  about  the  differences  be-
tween acquiring a fleet of commercial spacecraft compared with the
process  of  buying  commercial  aircraft  in  the  commercial  airline
market  and  our  experience  of  both.  At  the  risk  of  sounding  trite,
the short answer is that the differences between the process we are
going to undertake with Burt Rutan’s company and buying aircraft
from  Boeing  are  chalk  and  cheese.  We  are  in  uncharted  territory
here, and it is relatively easy now, on the basis of an output speci-
fication from an airline, for one of the major manufacturers to pro-
vide  one’s  needs  within  the  parameters  of  their  manufacturing  ca-
pability. And the business is highly regulated. We work in a highly
regulated environment in commercial airline operation, and rightly
so.

In  this  area,  the  area  of  personal  space  flights,  we  are  going  to
have to design different ideas as to how we create a viable vehicle,
and  we  are  going  to  be  working  very  closely  with  scale  composites
to  come  to  a  contractual  arrangement  with  each  other,  which  will
work for both parties to ensure that we get the thing built and we
get it operating viably as quickly as possible. But it will not be like
buying aircraft in the commercial airline market. We are at the ex-
perimental  cutting  edge  of  a  new  industry  here,  and  between  the
two of us, with our commercial experience and Burt’s experimental
aircraft  experience,  we  are  absolutely  convinced  that  we  can  come
up with something which will be viable and acceptable in terms of
safe operation to the FAA and the other organs of government who
are going to be involved in regulating the venture as it unfolds.

It is—one of the other questions that you asked was the question
of  the  space  act  of  last  year  and  issues  within  that  act,  which  are
important  to  us  and  things  that  the  government  can  do  to  help.
Frankly,  the  most  important  thing  to  say  is  we  don’t  want  help
from  the  government.  This  is  an  important  point  of  principle  here
that the parties undertaking this venture do it in the private sector
and  do  it  off  their  own  back.  However,  in  a  nascent  industry  like
this,  enabling  by  the  government  is  a  very  important  thing.  And  I
think  one  feature  of  the  act  that  we  would  like  to  look  at  more
closely  is  the  issue  of  the  insurability  of  this  industry.  For  this  in-
dustry  to  be  viable,  the  commercial  personal  space  flight  industry
to  be  viable,  it  is  important  that  some  of  the  breaks  on  insurance

and support from the government in the insurance area are carried
through beyond the current plan of 2008 to 2009 and that when the
government looks at this issue, they do extend the insurance provi-
sions  within  the  act  to  cover  a  longer  period  of  time  to  allow  this
industry  to  get  going  with  the  kind  of  support  it  needs.  Because
with  the  support  of  the  government,  the  insurability  of  the  third
party  uninvolved  risk  is  going  to  be  a  much  easier  thing  to  under-
take.

I  think  the  other  thing  that  the  government  can  help  us  with  is
enabling,  enabling  the  processes  that  we  undertake  and  taking  an
active  role  in  preventing  roadblocks  on  the  way.  We  believe  that
the FAA is an organization that is well up to the job of helping this
industry  to  form  and  form  a  safe  pattern  of  operation.  We  believe
the Defense Department can take its responsibilities to protect the
U.S.  public  very  seriously  and  at  the  same  time  not  hold  up  this
project.  We  don’t  see  roadblocks  on  the  way  at  the  moment,  but  if
they  appear,  we  would  like  the  chance  to  come  back  before  this
group and have the chance to tell you about it.

Thank you very much.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Whitehorn follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF WILL WHITEHORN

Chairman  Calvert,  Ranking  Member  Udall,  and  other  Members  of  this  distin-
guished  subcommittee,  on  behalf  of  Virgin  Galactic,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity
to testify today. Virgin Galactic appreciates the chance to explain how, with an un-
wavering commitment to safety, we plan to make available and affordable an adven-
ture  of  a  lifetime.  We  are  proud  to  be  on  the  leading  edge  of  the  commercial  space
industry and honored to have Burt Rutan as our future partner.

I am Will Whitehorn, the President of Virgin Galactic. I also am Group Corporate
Affairs  and  Brand  Development  Director  for  Virgin  Management  Limited.  I  have
nearly 30 years of aviation experience having previously worked for British Airways
and Thomas Cook before joining Virgin in 1987.

At the outset, I wish to acknowledge the invaluable leadership the House Science
Committee  and  this  subcommittee  provided  last  year  for  the  nascent  commercial
space  industry.  You  ensured  Congress  struck  a  proper  balance  in  the  Commercial
Space  Launch  Amendments  Act  of  2004.  Had  it  not  been  for  that  sensitivity  in
crafting a proper regulatory oversight regime consistent with the goal of permitting
our  emerging  industry  to  realize  its  full  potential,  it  is  unlikely  the  Virgin  Group
would have made our considerable commitment to Virgin Galactic.

Virgin  Galactic  is  a  private  sector  venture.  We  receive  no  state  aid.  Frankly,  we
think that is the way it should be. Entrepreneurs like Sir Richard Branson who are
willing  to  shoulder  the  economic  risk  and  challenge  of  commercializing  space  will
be the most successful innovators who lead this industry and chart its course. Gov-
ernment’s proper role is regulatory oversight and creating a climate in which entre-
preneurs can translate their vision into reality and innovation can flourish.

The  history  of  Virgin  Galactic  goes  back  to  the  mid-1990s  when  Sir  Richard
Branson identified that new technologies in composite materials, rocketry and com-
puting  could  easily  lead  to  the  development  of  safe,  economical  reusable  spacecraft
in the future. At that time, we registered the Virgin trademark in the area of space
travel. In 1999, we registered the Virgin Galactic name.

Virgin  has  a  long  history  of  working  with  Burt  Rutan  going  back  to  the  early
1990s. When Mr. Rutan informed us he was building a spaceship for a private cus-
tomer  to  win  the  X–Prize,  we  made  a  commitment  to  him  that  we  would  be  pre-
pared  to  develop  a  commercial  version  of  SpaceShipOne  should  he  be  successful.
Over  the  last  year  we  have  negotiated  with  Paul  G.  Allen,  the  visionary  and  fin-
ancier behind SpaceShipOne, to buy the rights to use his technology. Following the
successful  conclusion  of  these  negotiations,  we  signed  a  $21.5  million  deal  for  the
use  of  that  technology  and  developed  a  $100  million  investment  plan  to  build  up
to  five  spaceships  at  Mr.  Rutan’s  factory  in  Mohave,  California.  The  plan  for  the
ships themselves is being developed by Mr. Rutan to a specification created by Vir-
gin Galactic.

Safety  obviously  is  our  first  priority.  Our  commitment  to  safety  extends  beyond
the Virgin name, one of the best-known and most valuable brands in the world. Sir
Richard  Branson  has  said  that  he,  along  with  his  parents,  son  and  daughter  plan
to  travel  in  Virgin  Galactic’s  first  space  flight.  If  the  Federal  Aviation  Administra-
tion  permits  me  to  do  so,  I  hope  to  be  on  an  earlier  test  flight.  Our  commitment
to  safety  is  very  real  and  personal  to  us.  Safety  is  and  will  continue  to  be  Virgin
Galactic’s North Star.

Suffice  it  to  say  that  the  Virgin  Group  has  considerable  experience  in  issues  re-
garding  passenger  carriage  and  an  unwavering  commitment  to  safety.  Virgin  cur-
rently  operates  three  separate  airlines  around  the  world  which  together  carry  over
50  million  passengers  a  year.  The  best  known  of  these  is  Virgin  Atlantic  Airways
whose  main  business  is  operating  scheduled  services  between  the  United  Kingdom
and a variety of destinations in the United States, as well as flights to the Far East,
Africa and Australia. We have an unblemished safety record having never lost a sin-
gle  passenger  in  over  21  years  of  operation.  All  of  our  airlines  also  are  profitable
without  ever  having  received  any  state  subsidy.  We  also  operate  the  U.K.’s  largest
long-distance rail company which also has an unblemished safety record despite car-
rying 35 million passengers per year at speeds over 125 miles per hour.

Let  me  briefly  describe  the  out-of-this-world  service  Virgin  is  known  for  that,
quite  literally,  we  intend  to  offer  to  Virgin  Galactic  customers.  It  is  envisaged  that
the  astronauts  we  carry  will  experience  a  two  hour  trip.  Half  of  that  will  involve
the  thrill  of  climbing  to  a  safe  altitude  with  the  mother  ship  and  then  our  astro-
nauts  will  experience  the  exhilaration  of  spending  an  hour  on  SpaceShipTwo  as  it
accelerates  to  over  three  times  the  speed  of  sound  and  climbs  to  well  in  excess  of
the  100km  altitude  officially  recognized  as  entering  space,  and  becoming  one  of  the
few humans to have left the planet. Our current plan is to begin operations in Mo-
have and then develop a second site in another location that could possibly be either
Florida, Texas or New Mexico. The flights will be what is known as sub-orbital. The
pioneers who become astronauts with Virgin Galactic will initially pay $200,000 for
the trip but the Company hopes to reduce the cost over time as the business devel-
ops. Our long-term goal is to develop commercial space tourism into an orbital busi-
ness which could in the future carry payloads as well as people into orbit.

Chairman  Calvert,  the  Subcommittee  asked  that  I  address  several  specific  ques-

tions in my testimony. Let me turn to them now.

The  Subcommittee  asked  about  the  timetable  for  taking  possession  of  the  Virgin
Galactic spacecraft, first flight and expected profitability. At this time, Virgin Galac-
tic  has  a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  Mr.  Rutan’s  company,  Scaled  Com-
posites,  to  customize  the  SpaceShipOne  vehicle  for  commercial  use.  Design  work  to
that end continues. However, we have not yet formally ordered the spacecraft. After
U.S.  Government  technology  transfer  issues  are  clarified  and  addressed  if  deemed
necessary,  we  hope  to  place  a  firm  order  for  the  spacecraft.  At  this  point,  due  to
uncertainty  about  possible  licensing  requirements,  we  are  not  able  to  even  view
Scaled Composites’ designs for the commercial space vehicle.

Mr.  Chairman,  we  are  not  concerned  about  this  lack  of  clarity  on  the  technology
licensing issue and the nominal delay it has caused to date. Like any nascent indus-
try overseen by government oversight agencies faced with issues of first impression,
we understand instances such as this are to be expected. We are continuing a robust
and  cordial  dialogue  with  the  Department  of  Defense  and  other  agencies  that  pro-
vide input on technology licensing issues. We hope a consensus can soon be reached
that  will  clear  the  way  for  us  to  move  forward  with  a  formal  order  for  Mr.  Rutan’s
spacecraft.

In terms of first flight, we are hopeful Virgin Galactic will begin service in either
2008 or 2009. Let me be clear, this is an estimate only. As I testified earlier, safety
is  our  North  Star  and  it  will  determine  our  launch  date.  We  will  launch  as  soon
as our safety assessments and training dictate we do so, and not a day before. Our
launch  date  estimate  also  assumes  prompt  clarification  of  the  U.S.  Government
technology  licensing  issue  I  just  mentioned.  The  longer  it  remains  unresolved,  it
could adversely impact our projected launch date.

As far as profitability is concerned, our business plan projects that we will attain
profitability  in  our  fourth  or  fifth  year  of  operation.  Importantly,  this  estimate  as-
sumes  five  spaceships,  two  launch  aircraft  or  mother  ships,  and  two  launch  bases
in the United States. If the schedule for deploying any of these assets slips, it would
negatively impact our target date for profitability.

Mr. Chairman, the Subcommittee asked that I comment on the differences in pro-
curing  a  commercial  spaceship  fleet  and  Virgin  Atlantic’s  experience  acquiring  a
fleet of commercial aircraft. At the risk of sounding trite, the short answer is every-
thing. Virgin Atlantic is a customer of both Boeing and Airbus aircraft. Being a cus-
tomer of commercial aircraft essentially is a passive process. While you can request

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 06:47 Dec 09, 2005 Jkt 020541 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA05\042005\20541 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

28

some  custom  features,  the  aircraft  as  designed  by  the  manufacturer  essentially  is
a complete unit and customer suggestions and requests tend to relate to the margin.
Virgin  Galactic’s  relationship  with  Scaled  Composites  is  very  different.  It  is  an  ac-
tive  partnership.  It  is  envisaged  that  we  will  work  very  closely  together  designing
the aircraft and sharing our complementary expertise. Simply put, it will be a sym-
biotic  relationship  where  ideas  and  intellectual  capital  are  shared  by  the  customer
and manufacturer to ensure a successful product that benefits both.

This  active  partnership  dynamic  is  precisely  why  we  are  so  pleased  to  have  Burt
Rutan as our future partner. Incidentally, in a decade or so when the history books
are  written  describing  the  birth  of  the  commercial  space  industry,  I  am  confident
that just as the Boeing brand is synonymous with ushering in the age of commercial
jet travel, Scaled Composites will deservedly receive similar recognition for its trail-
blazing role in our industry.

Mr.  Chairman,  let  me  now  turn  to  the  question  the  Subcommittee  asked  about
what  preparations  we  presently  are  undertaking  for  the  use  of  the  spaceships  we
plan to purchase from Mr. Rutan. We are focused on complying fully with the letter
and  spirit  of  the  Commercial  Space  Launch  Amendments  Act  of  2004.  Scaled  Com-
posites  will  have  sole  responsibility  to  certify  the  spacecraft.  However,  together,  we
are engaged in an active dialogue with the Federal Aviation Administration on other
aspects  of  our  business.  At  the  same  time,  we  are  designing  a  program  to  prepare
our  astronauts  for  an  incredible  sensory  experience  and  to  allow  them  to  gain  the
maximum  from  their  journey  to  space.  That  program  will  include  training  in  all
areas  from  physiological  to  psychological.  We  want  to  ensure  our  passengers  have
the optimum sensory experience but, even more importantly, that the operation will
be undertaken with the utmost safety, consistent with safety being our absolute pri-
ority.

Finally,  Mr.  Chairman,  you  asked  what,  if  anything,  should  the  government  be
doing to encourage commercial space. Let me reiterate a point I made earlier. Virgin
Galactic is a private venture. Consistent with our belief that the proper role for gov-
ernment in encouraging the commercial space industry should not include financial
subsidies,  we  receive  no  state  aid.  We  believe  there  is  great  potential  for  mutually
beneficial  partnerships  between  NASA  and  private  companies  involved  in  our
emerging  industry.  In  other  words,  we  support  public-private  partnerships.  For  in-
stance, NASA should seek opportunities to contract with private sector manufactur-
ers for cutting-edge designs and outside-the-box thinking. I am encouraged by signs
of progress in NASA’s willingness to engage with the private sector in idea sharing.
This  spirit  of  cooperation  should  be  encouraged  and  broadened  whenever  practical
to do so. Virgin Galactic, for example, would welcome the opportunity to provide as-
sistance to NASA for aspects of astronaut training. If NASA’s first instinct is to look
to private sector commercial space partners for opportunities to work together, I be-
lieve both NASA and our industry will be the better for it.

Mr.  Chairman,  let  me  conclude  by  again  thanking  you,  Ranking  Member  Udall,
and other Subcommittee Members for the opportunity to testify today. Virgin Galac-
tic looks forward to working with you and your staff. Burt Rutan has expressed his
wish to put the first private spacecraft on Mars. It may be several more years before
I  get  the  chance  to  address  the  Subcommittee  on  that  subject!  I  am  pleased  to  re-
spond  to  your  questions  today  and  to  keep  you  apprised  of  relevant  developments
as we prepare to take-off.

DISCUSSION

5–10 YEAR COMMERCIAL SPACE INDUSTRY OUTLOOK

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
Now we will open up for questions.
Mr.  Rutan,  this  is  obviously  very  exciting,  and  this  is  moving  a
lot  quicker  than  we  imagined  just  a  year  ago  that  we  would  be
moving to this next stage of space exploration.

What is your outlook for the commercial space industry, you kind
of  mentioned  this  in  your  testimony,  but  maybe  you  would  like  to
expand on this, over the next five to 10 years? And how do you ex-
pect  SpaceShipOne  or  SpaceShipTwo  to  fair  commercially?  Do
you—how—what do you see the vision of this?

Mr.  RUTAN.  Yes,  I  did  try  to  summarize  that  in  my  opening  re-
marks,  but  I  will  tell  you  that  we  won’t  sell  spaceliners  or  space-
ships to spacelines that aren’t safe to fly. And we don’t plan to de-
velop  ones  that  will  have  large  direct  operating  costs,  because  we
don’t  need  to.  We  believe  we  have  all  of  the  technologies  dem-
onstrated.  There  are  several  new  technologies.  There  are  probably
a  couple  of  new  patents  in  work  now  relating  to  the  new  vehicles
that will be commercial. But I think our risks that we need to take
right  now  are  tiny  compared  to  the  risks  that  we  took  in  the  year
2001 to get to the goals of SpaceShipOne. When we have available
spaceships  that  can  be  flown  at  low  direct  operating  cost  per  seat
and  provide  the  real  experience,  and  I  want  to  point  out  this  will
not  be  the  experience  like  you  saw  in  SpaceShipOne  where  you
have  a  small  cabin  and  people  are  strapped  down  and  they  have
little  windows.  The  very  first  generation  of  commercial  sub-orbital
spaceships will be experience-optimized. There will be large cabins.
There will be big windows. There will be—since you only have four
or  five  minutes  of  weightless  time,  they  will  pull  a  bar  open,  and
you  will  float  your  body  about  the  cabin.  We  think  that  is  ex-
tremely important to do on a short space flight.

So  we  are  working  very  hard  on  assuring  that  this  will  be  ex-
tremely attractive to the public, it will be extremely affordable, and
it  will  be  at  least  as  safe  as  the  early  airlines.  If  we  achieve  those
goals, and I think we really can, we don’t have tough answers to—
in  front  of  us  or  new  challenges  in  front  of  us  to  get  there,  but  if
we  achieve  those  goals,  I  think  this  is  going  to  be  a  much,  much
bigger market than anyone imagines. I think once it is determined
that this is a business that is profitable, I think very much like the
early  airlines,  you  will  get  dozens  of  businesses  wanting  to  be—
wanting  to  compete  with  Virgin,  for  example,  and  wanting  to  be
space  flight  operators.  I  believe  that  a  lot  of  those  will  fail  either
financially  or  their  ability  to  raise  capital  or  their  inability  to  fol-
low—to  support  and  follow  the  maintenance  and  other  guidelines
that  we  will  set  up.  And  in  fact,  we  are  looking  at  having  this  not
like  selling  a  spaceship  that  says,  ‘‘Here,  take  it  and  do  what  you
want,’’ but we are looking at doing it as a franchise, like a Wendy’s
franchise.  You  buy  our  product,  but  you  have  to  follow  very  care-
fully our rules in how to maintain it and how to operate it and the
limits of its operation.

Chairman  CALVERT.  I  don’t  know  if  you  want  to  use  Wendy’s  as

an example.

Mr.  RUTAN.  Well,  okay.  McDonald’s  franchise,  right.  But  at  any
rate, the important thing is because of where we stand in the mar-
ketplace now, I think we will be able to assure that all of the oper-
ators operate it safely.

Now I believe, like the early airlines, most of these that want to
that  will  try,  I  think  most  of  these  will  fall  out  for  the  same  rea-
sons that the early airline companies did. But I expect to see that,
say, in the—between five and 10 years into the operation of these,
I expect to see that you will have three or four operators with mul-
tiple sites that are operating reliably, and they are going to be com-
peting  with  each  other,  and  they  are  going  to  have  an  enormous,
enormous  market.  The  space  market  has  never  had  any  product,
any  payload  that  is  high  volume.  Generally,  nowadays,  if  you  are
doing something commercial in space, you don’t complain a lot that
you have to pay $80 million to buy a booster, because your payload
that  is  in  it,  you  may  invest  a  half  a  billion  dollars  to  build  this
payload.  Well,  the  payloads  for  this  industry  don’t  cost  anything.
In  fact,  they  pay  to  fly.  That  is  a  totally  different  concept  for  the
space  industry.  In  fact,  the  payloads  can  be  easily  reproduced  by
unskilled  labor.  And  I  don’t  see  a  limit  to  it,  whereas  there  has
been very specific limits to everything.

Another  thing,  if  we  reach  our  goals  on  affordability  and  safety,
it will affect everything else that is done in space. For example, as
we  flow  this  capability  of  very  high  volume,  very  low  cost,  high
safety  into  the  orbital  market,  all  of  a  sudden,  those  that  go  out
and  want  to  do  exploration  of  the  planets,  instead  of  being  able  to
afford  to  build  one  or  two  of  these  every  couple  of  years,  we  can
build  thousands  and  hundreds  and  send  them  everywhere  and  do
real  exploration  because  it  will  be  affordable.  I  have  had  NASA,
two  different  centers,  including  NASA  headquarters,  insisting  that
I  keep  SpaceShipOne  flying  so  that  they  can  fly  their  payloads  on
it.  You  know,  they  have  made  a  lot  of  these  payloads  for  student
projects and so on, and they just don’t have an ability to fly it.

My position on that has been that NASA certainly has a lot more
capability  to  fly  science  payloads  than  we  do.  They  have  a  space
station.  They  have  a  reusable  Space  Shuttle.  The  reason  that  they
can’t fly their own payloads is not my fault. And I have refused to
do  that,  because  I  have  refused  to  have  anything  in  my  way  in
order  to,  as  quickly  as  we  can,  get  an  operable  system  that  flies
safe and flies cheap. And I think it is much better for NASA to just
wait  and  buy  tickets  rather  than  us  doing  science  projects  to  de-
velop that kind of capability along the way. We have put all of this
other interest and all of this other stuff aside so that we can quick-
ly reach the goal. And that goal will help everything else.

Chairman CALVERT. Thank you.
Mr. Udall, a skilled man.
Mr. UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The  testimony  that  both  of  you  presented  was  fascinating,  and  I

am looking forward to hearing more about your point of view.

REGULATORY AND APPROVAL PROCESS

Mr.  Rutan,  you  talked  about  some  of  the  challenges  working
through  the—an  approval  process  for  SpaceShipOne.  As  you  look
ahead  at  developing  a  commercial  version  of  this  spaceship,  have

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 06:47 Dec 09, 2005 Jkt 020541 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\042005\20541 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

31

you  had  any  discussions  with  FAA  as  to  what  you  will  have  to  do
to get your vehicle approved for commercial service? And would you
be  willing  to  talk  with  us  and/or  provide  some  specific  ideas  about
changes  to  the  process?  And  perhaps  you  could  do  that  for  the
record. Again, we have got limited time today, but——

Mr.  RUTAN.  Absolutely.  I  have  had  multiple  meetings  with  the
FAA Administrator. I have insisted that at least one of those meet-
ings including having the airplane people as well as the space peo-
ple,  you  know,  AVR  as  well  as  AST,  and  I  did  succeed  last  month
in having that meeting where all three were in the same room. And
that  was  in  the  FAA  Administrator’s  office.  It  was  a  meeting  of
more than two hours, and I made my point that the FAA does need
to stand up to the responsibility for assuring the safety of the pas-
sengers.  And  I  believe  that  that  process  can  be  structured  so  that
the applicant for flying commercial flights can get an acceptance by
the  FAA  that  he  has  indeed  done  his  testing  and  has  defined  the
testing that is needed for—to show his margins, his safety margins.
I  believe  that  can  be  done  with  a  very  minor  effect  on  the  cost  of
the developer.

However,  this  is  a  subject  that  FAA  seems  to  be  afraid  of.  They
seem to be happy that they are not required under the new legisla-
tion  to  certify  these  ships.  And  I  think  it  is—really  comes  down  to
the  problem  is  that  they  just  flat  don’t  have  the  people  that  are
qualified to do it. I don’t believe that the new ships will go through
a  conformity  process  like  you  do  in  a  part  25  certification  for  air-
planes.  And  we  have  developed  specific  processes  for  that  as  sug-
gestions.  And  I  am—I  hope  to,  over  this  next  month  or  two,  have
a  meeting  with  the  working  level  certification  people  so  we  can
present this. But we have not had that opportunity yet.

SIMILARITIES TO AIRLINES

Mr. UDALL. Thank you.
If I could, I would move to Mr. Whitehorn.
You  have  got  a  background  in  the  airline  industry.  Would  you
talk  a  little  bit  about  what  aspects  of  your  operations  that  you
think  will  be  similar  to  the  airline  industry  and  which  aspects
would be different?

Mr.  WHITEHORN.  Yes.  I  mean,  I  think  when  we  look  at  issues
such  as  the  certification  of  the  spacecraft,  I  mean,  Burt  Rutan’s
company,  Scaled  Composites,  will  be  responsible  for  certifying  the
SpaceShipTwo,  which  we  have  developed  into  a  commercial  busi-
ness.  So  I  won’t  talk  about  those  issues  at  all.  We  will  leave  that
to Burt.

We  will  receive—we  have  engaged  in  an  active  dialogue  as  well
with  the  FAA  at  the  moment,  which  is  in  a  much  happier  area,
which is the area of what the passenger experience will be and the
program  to  prepare  the  astronauts  for  flight  and  the  regime  that
we will operate in terms of the safety of those astronauts, what we
will  need  to  do  on  the  medical  front  to  ensure  they  are  fit  to  fly.
We  are  planning  to  buy  a  system  from  Burt  Rutan,  which  would
allow  80  percent  of  the  population  of  the  world  to  fly  in  terms  of
medical  areas.  And  in  terms  of  age,  it  would  be  open  to  anybody
of any age to fly. But obviously, from the point of view of the FAA,
we will come up with a set of standards and guidelines as to what

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 06:47 Dec 09, 2005 Jkt 020541 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\042005\20541 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

32

we  will  deem  acceptable.  And  what  the  legislation  allows  us  to  do
is to work in quite an open forum on those issues of the guidelines
as to what the passenger will have to experience.

Where  I  think  this  differs  from  the  commercial  airline  industry
is that the commercial airline industry has been regulated now for
the  best  part  of  70  years,  properly  regulated,  in  the  United  King-
dom  and  the  United  States.  And  the  difference  here  is  that  there
is  no  precedent  to  base  things  upon.  The  precedent  of  the  past  is
to  look  at  the  best  that  has  happened  in  the  world  of  commercial
aviation and try and apply the important principles of that but not
create  rules  before  we  know  exactly  the  direction  of  where  we  are
going is, but to try and develop the rules that will be there for the
future in as open a forum as possible between the parties involved
in  this  industry.  And  I  think  that  is  achievable.  I  think  the  FAA
has  an  open  attitude  to  those  aspects.  And  I  think  that  when  it
comes  to  the  certification  of  the  craft  itself,  that  is  Mr.  Rutan’s
area, the principles around how it operates the business will be our
area,  as  the  commercial  operator.  And  you  know,  I  think  the  prin-
ciples  of  safety  for  us  are  paramount.  The  principles  that  we  do
want to create an experience for the customers that they can have
confidence  in,  and  the  kind  of  sophisticated  individuals  we  are
dealing at the moment have an understanding of risk, but they are
expecting  an  experience,  which  will  be  along  the  lines—I  mean,  as
Burt said, the early days of commercial aviation, back in the 1920s
and  1930s,  or  somewhere  around  where  private  aviation  got  after
the  second  world  war  in  the  USA  in  terms  of  the  level  of  safety.
That  is  what  the  audience  expects  that  we  are  addressing  this
product to. And I think that our north star in safety is going to be
ensuring that the standards that we introduce to service at the be-
ginning of the operation of this by the end of this decade are stand-
ards that then can be improved by experience all of the time.

And if one starts from a prescription of where you begin, you are
never  going  to  get  to  the  position  of  creating  guidelines  that  can
be  improved  and  developed  with  experience.  And  one  of  the  things
I  am  encouraged  by,  though,  is  in  that  particular  area  I  think  the
FAA is spot on in the way it is working.

Mr. UDALL. Thank you.
Chairman CALVERT. Mr. Rohrabacher.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, I thank you very much. And let me just
sing the praises of Burt Rutan, who, of course, everybody sings the
praises of Burt Rutan. I don’t know if you are Hans Solo or Charles
Lindbergh,  but  whoever  you  are,  Mr.  Rutan,  you  are  an  historic
person,  and  it  has  been  my  honor  to  have  had  the  opportunity  to
know you and to watch with amazement some of the things you are
doing.  So  thank  you  very  much  for  being  just  a  role  model  to
young—the  young  people  in  America  and  old  people  in  America  as
well.

Mr.  RUTAN.  Well,  thank  you,  Dana.  I  consider  myself  someone
that  just  hides  out  in  the  high  desert  in  California  and  has  as
much fun as I can. And I don’t look at it that way at all, but thank
you very much.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  I  would  hope  that  when  people  are
studying in our universities and in our high schools that when they
pick  people  out  to  study  and  to  see  what  type  of  person  they  were

and  to  use  as  examples  for—I  would  certainly  hope  that  the  edu-
cation community takes a look at Burt Rutan and makes him a full
chapter  in  the  book,  because  that  is  what  our  young  people  need.
Mr.  RUTAN.  I  believe  that  the  education,  which  has—NASA  has
spent  a  lot  of  money  over  the  last  three  decades  on  trying  to  keep
the  interest  in  education,  I  believe  that  problem  will  totally  dis-
appear once there is a growing industry out there and kids can not
just  kind  of  be  prompted  to  dream  about  being  an  astronaut,  they
will  be  making  their  plans  to  fly.  And  once  you  have  that,  I  think
we  are  going  to  get  an  enormous  amount  of  increase  in  those  that
go  to  school  to  learn  engineering  and  science  and  those  that  deal
with  all  of  the  aspects  of  this  new  industry.  And  I  don’t  think  our
education problem will be a problem at all once there is something
real that is going on.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay. Thank you very much.
The—I had to leave a few moments ago, because Lieutenant Gen-
eral Arnold, who is the command of the Space Missile Center there
in  Los  Angeles,  was—needed  to  meet  me  right  outside  the  room
here.  And  I  think  that  it  is  significant,  and  you  mentioned  this  in
your  testimony  in  passing,  that  in  the  past—as  in  contrast  to  the
past,  where  there  were  spin-off  effects  from  America’s  defense
spending  to  the  private  sector.  You  believe  that  there  is  going  to
be a great spin-off or collateral effect for national defense and other
type of issues from the private sector investment in space.

Mr. RUTAN. I have got an example that supports that, and let me
just  state  that  I  don’t  think  the  primes—Lockheed  and  Boeing,  for
example,  I  don’t  think  they  know  it  yet,  they  will  be  developing
large numbers of low-cost launch capabilities. And the reason I say
that is we have an example in front of us that I really truly believe
is  a  parallel  and  that  is  in  the  late  ’70s,  IBM  did  not  know  that
in  a  few  years  they  would  be  building  tens  of  thousands  of  $700
computers. They really didn’t know that. They found out that they
had to force themselves into that market. They had to realize that,
‘‘Hey,  we  are  not  just  a  company  that  makes  a  handful  of  main-
frame  computers.’’  And  they  changed  very  quickly,  and  they  got  in
and they competed. And I think that is going to happen also as this
paradigm changes to where there are the benefits of cost and safety
and an enormous lot of activity.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Which  leads  me  to  a  question  for  Mr.
Whitehorn. And of course, let me applaud you, as well. Very rarely
do  we  have  a  witness  come  here  before  us  in  Washington  saying
that they aren’t asking for any help.

Mr.  WHITEHORN.  Well,  that  is  because  I  come  from  the  United
Kingdom,  and  if  you  ask  the  government  for  any  help,  they  just
don’t get it.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  But  I  noted—I  think  we  noted  two  things
here.  Number  one,  you  were  asking,  basically,  correct  me  if  I  am
wrong,  for  making  sure  that  we  have  definitions  of  liability  that
will permit your business to succeed. And I think that that is some-
thing that we understand.

EXPORT CONTROLS AND TECH TRANSFER

Number  two,  you  also  mentioned  tech  transfer,  just  in  passing.
Is there a problem? And again, there are military and security im-

plications  to  the  craft  that  is  being  developed,  because  obviously,
frankly, what Burt is developing here as something for the general
public  has  some  very  great  implications  for  the  security  of  the
United States and the free world. Are there problems with transfer
to Britain, to a British company and——

Mr.  RUTAN.  Yes,  I  thought  that  Britain—or  that  England  was  a
relatively  friendly  nation  to  America.  And  at  least  reading  the  pa-
pers,  you  would  see  that.  But  when  you  try  to  export  designed
things  that  are  tied  to  either  rockets  or  the  avionics  that  go  in
rockets,  we  have  seen  this  as  an  extremely  difficult  thing.  And  it
has  been  one  of  the  reasons  that  we  have  had  to  move  away  from
the basic concept of this being a foreign-funded development of the
ship, even though it is a very friendly country. And I have been to
London. I found these people seem to like us, too.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well——
Mr. RUTAN. But let me point out——
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  And  people  will  be  able  to  get  to  London  a

lot quicker in your——

Mr.  RUTAN.  First  of  all,  I  don’t  think  we  are  going  to  have  this
problem  in  the  short  term  now  by  developing  the  ship  here.  And
if  we  fly  them  within  the  United  States,  I  think  that  problem  will
be  minimized.  However,  relatively  soon,  and  I  think  this  will  hap-
pen  in  the  first  decade  of  commercial  operations,  there  will  be  re-
quests,  and  very  serious,  well-funded  requests.  We  have  gotten
them  even  from  the  guys  building  that  new  city  outside  of  Dubai.
They want to run space lines in their country. And when you take
something  that  does  have  some  technologies  that  would  transfer
over—that  could  be  transferred  over  into  a  weapon,  even  though
these  technologies  are  all  really  in  the  public  domain,  we  run  into
very  severe  restrictions.  We  have  wrestled  with  this  problem  in
terms  of  technology  transfer  to  Virgin  Atlantic  for  about  five
months  now.  And  it  has  been—it  doesn’t  seem  to  meet  logic,  and
it  has  been  difficult.  I  think—and  as  a  result  of  that,  we  are  dis-
couraging,  until  there  are  routine  commercial  operations  going  on
in this country, and it can be shown that for the same reasons that
we  sell  airliners  that  we  don’t  want  to  have  technology,  that  they
don’t  have  to  have  the  technology  in  order  to  operate  a  spaceline.
And  I  think  that  is  not  going  to  work  on  the  early  stages,  because
we  just  flat  can  not  export  it.  But  I  believe  once  there  is  routine
operations  going  on  this  country,  then  we  will  be  able  to  surpass
those  roadblocks  and  be  able  to  set  up  sites  in  Dubai  or  in  Aus-
tralia or in Europe.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, just one note, and I know my
time  is  up,  and  that  is  I  have  been  a  long-time  advocate  of  a  two-
tiered  system  of  technology  transfer  controls  where  countries  like
Australia and England and other countries that are totally friendly
to  the  United  States  should  not  have  the  type  of  restrictions  on
them as compared to a country that poses a potential threat to the
United  States.  And  thus,  it  should  be  a  totally  free  market  with
those countries.

Chairman CALVERT. The gentleman——
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much.
Chairman  CALVERT.  The  gentleman  is  correct,  however,  you
know, there are still some burn marks from 1812 over at the Cap-

35

itol.  We  may  have  to  send  Virgin  a  bill  for  cleaning  some  of  that
up.

Mr.  WHITEHORN.  I  would  just  like  to  add  a  couple  of  comments
to  what  Burt  said  there.  We  don’t  envision  a  problem  with  the
DDTC or with the Department of Defense. We are having a robust
and very friendly dialogue on this issue. But we have made it clear
to  them  that  we  are  not  planning  to  export  the  vehicles,  and  we
are planning to operate the vehicles only in the USA to start with.
But if you look at the marketplace, and I think back to Burt’s point
about  Boeing  selling  aircraft  around  the  world  or  Lockheed  selling
aircraft around the world, the market for this is worldwide. Of the
29,000  people  who  have  registered  that  wish  to  pay  the  deposit,
only 40 percent are from the U.S. Now a lot of the people are going
to  be  coming  from  other  parts  of  the  world  to  fly  in  the  U.S.,  but
this  could  be  an  export  industry  for  the  U.S.  And  you  know,  this
country  has  a  balance  of  payments  problem,  there  is  no  doubt
about  it.  And  you  know,  you  have  to  look  to  the  methodologies
which  you  are  adopting  in  terms  of  every  aspect  of  export  of  tech-
nology  from  this  country,  because,  you  know,  it  is  the  export  of
technology,  which  is  the  lifeblood  of  an  industrial  country.  And  at
the moment, there are issues to deal with on this front.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. Costa.
Mr. COSTA. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and the Rank-
ing Member for having this hearing today. I think it really focuses
on  a  very  important  growing  technology  that  I  think  all  of  us  are
excited  about.  And  I,  too,  want  to  commend  Burt  Rutan  as  the  re-
cipient,  for  the  second  time,  of  the  Collier  Trophy.  It  just  goes  to
show that kids that grow up in Silicon Valley can do good, as a na-
tive  not  far  away  from  Fresno.  We  are  very  proud  of  all  of  those
accomplishments, obviously.

I  have  two  questions,  and  I  think  it  was  important  in  your—
both—Mr. Rutan, your testimony, and Mr. Whitehorn, to remind us
of the history of aviation in the 1920s and the 1930s. Douglas and
Northrop and a little company in San Diego called Ryan that built
an  airplane  for  a  fellow  named  Lindbergh,  and  how  that  whole  re-
lationship  developed  between  entrepreneurs  who  had  a  vision  and
had  a  dream  to  fly  and  the  partnerships,  the  public  partnerships
that  later  developed.  Obviously,  if  it  weren’t  for  the  establishment
of  the  Federal  Postal  System  giving  contracts  to  the  fledging  air-
lines of those days, because the passengers certainly weren’t paying
for the airlines to come together, but if you could get a postal route,
it  made  a  big  difference.  And  that  whole  evolution  process,  and  I
think there are certainly applicable lessons to be learned as we de-
velop this industry, as you so well stated, Mr. Rutan, in your com-
ments, and you as well, Mr. Whitehorn.

ECONOMICS OF COMMERCIAL SPACE

Two questions. One, and I don’t know if you are yet at this level
in terms of developing your economic model. You talk about 27,000-
plus  interested  parties  that  have  indicated,  and  we  hear  the  num-
ber  thrown  around  about  $200,000  per  flight  per  individual,  and
say,  maybe  half  of  those  actually  end  up  purchasing  a  ticket.  And
you  can  do  the  math,  obviously,  but  have  you  done  any  economic

36

models in terms of the multiple impact? I spent some time in high-
speed rail and others, and they like to talk about a two-to-one fac-
tor,  for  every  dollar  spent,  there  are  $2  benefit  in  return  in  terms
of  the  ripple  impact  to  other  economic  sectors  or  subcontractors  or
the  like.  Have  you  developed  anything  like  that  yet  at  this  point
in time?

Mr.  WHITEHORN.  No,  we  haven’t  done  it  at  this  stage.  I  mean,
what  we  have  done  is  we  have  taken  Burt’s  costs  in  the  develop-
ment  of  SpaceShipOne  and  some  feasibility  work  that  Burt  did  for
us  last  year  before  we  signed  the  contract  with  them  to  buy  the
technology. And we have modeled. We believe that with it—for the
expenditure  of  $120  million,  we  can  get  to  a  viable  business  and
that the early pioneers will pay $200,000 to fly on this model, and
we  believe  that  by  year  five  we  can  be  reducing  those  costs  very
considerably. And from the point of view of the individuals, we be-
lieve  that  eventually  we  could  get  it  down  to  $25,000  or  $30,000
after a number of years per flight per person.

In terms of the economic impact outside of Virgin Galactic’s own
business plan and Burt’s own business is he uses us as the launch
customer,  as  Boeing  would  describe  it.  And  our  status  as  a  launch
customer  will  obviously  give  Burt  the  basis  on  which  to  invest  in
developing  further  projects.  And  we,  in  a  symbolic  relationship,
would envision ourselves developing an orbital business eventually
out of the Virgin Galactic business.

My personal view is that the developments that we undertake to-
gether,  Burt  as  the  manufacturer  and  ourselves  as  the  customer,
will  have  a  considerable  effect  on  the  industry  as  a  whole,  on  the
space industry in the United States. NASA, for example, you know,
will  be  able  to  help  us  by  being  a  customer.  But  the  reason  they
should  come  to  us  as  a  customer  is  because  we  can  do  for  them
what  needs  to  be  done  more  efficiently  than  they  can  do  it  them-
selves.  And  that  is  how  public-private  partnerships  work.  One
thing  that  the  UK  has  actually  excelled  in  the  past  20  years  is
privatizing  its  publicly  owned  industrial  structure  and  creating
partnerships  between  the  public  sector  and  the  private  sector.  If
you  look  at  our  National  Health  Service  in  Britain,  for  example,  it
was run like a Soviet operation 10 or 15 years ago. Everything was
done  inside  the  health  service.  Now  10  billion  pounds  worth,  so
about  $20  billion  worth,  of  contracts  per  year  are  let  by  the  Na-
tional Health Service, which is a publicly owned institution, to the
private  sector.  I  don’t  think  NASA  has  gotten  as  far  as  that  in
terms of its attitude to the private sector yet.

Mr. COSTA. Yeah.
Mr. WHITEHORN. But when it does, and when organizations, such
as  NASA,  buy  in  more  and  more  from  the  private  sector,  as  this
industry develops, and I don’t mean the Lockheed or Boeing private
sector.

Mr. COSTA. Right.
Mr.  WHITEHORN.  I  mean,  not  the  primes,  but  the  new  industry
that emerges, I think you will see a ripple effect in terms of invest-
ment. But it is too early to model that for the moment.

Mr. COSTA. Thank you. And——
Mr.  RUTAN.  Could  I  comment  briefly  on  the  launch  customer

point that——

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 06:47 Dec 09, 2005 Jkt 020541 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\042005\20541 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

37

Mr. COSTA. Sure.
Mr.  RUTAN.—Will  made?  I  think  it  is  extremely  important  to  us
that  we  have  a  Virgin  as  a  launch  customer,  because  if  I  would
look  back  before  Richard  Branson’s  interest  in  this,  my  business
model assumed that this business would start off from a low-credi-
bility standpoint, both from developing and building spaceships and
for  those  that  operate  them.  I  didn’t  dream  and  expect  that  a  Jet
Blue  or  a  United  or  American  Airlines  would  come  in  and  buy
spaceships early in this game. I just—my gut told me that they will
pass  on  that.  The  fact  that  a  major  world  airline  has  stepped  up
and has told us that they want to buy the first five spaceships and
that  they  want  to  operate,  and  they  have  already  gone  out  and
done  market  surveys  and  so  on,  that  fact  that  an  airline,  not  just
whatever else would—you would think would be there, has stepped
up  has  given  me  the  ability  to  go  out  and  get  the  investment  that
is  needed  to  develop  and  certify  the  spaceships.  So  I  didn’t  expect
that  we  would  start  off  from  that  strength.  The  fact  that  we  have
a launch customer, which is a successful, major airline is absolutely
huge.

Mr. WHITEHORN. I have to add, of course, that Virgin Atlantic is
just  another  normal  airline.  As  they  say  in  Denmark  about
Carlsberg, it is probably the best airline in the world.

Mr.  COSTA.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  know  my  time  has  run  out,  but  I
do  have  a  technology  application  question  that  Mr.  Rutan  might
want  to  respond  to  later  on  to  the  Committee,  but  I—in  terms  of
the  application  of  this  technology,  I  know  there  has  been  a  lot  of
investment  by  NASA  and  by  some  other  companies  on  hypersonic
space  flight  to  bridge  the  continents,  and  I  would  like  to  have  a
better  understanding  of  whether  or  not  there  is  an  application  of
this technology to that at a later stage. And you can maybe do that
in a written statement or whatever suits the Chairman.

Chairman  CALVERT.  Certainly.  We  could  move  into  our  next—

Mr. Honda.

Mr. HONDA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member.
Let me just piggyback on my colleague’s question, and maybe you
could  answer  that  question  at  the  same  time  that—piggyback  on
the question that I am going to ask.

First  of  all,  I—you  know,  as  a  kid  that  grew  up  watching  Flash
Gordon  in  his  young  adult,  the—you  know,  Star  Trek  and  all  of
that sort of stuff, I find this subject very interesting.

A  quick  comment  on  NASA.  I  think  NASA  will  probably  be  in  a
position to do more partnering if this Administration had the fore-
sight  to  invest  more  into  the  projects  that  we  have,  because  cur-
rently we are looking at massive cuts, and massive cuts that would
affect  young  people  who  would  consider  space  flight  and  manned
space  flight  if  we  were  to  invest  properly  in  a  more  healthy  way
into  this  area.  That  is  a  personal  comment,  because  I  agree  with
both  of  you  that  NASA  has  a  great  role  to  play.  And  as  a  school-
teacher, I do believe that NASA has a role to play in terms of edu-
cation and primary research.

SAFETY CONCERNS

Having said that, along with Mr. Costa’s question, in terms of re-
search in manned space flights, do you believe that there are—that

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 06:47 Dec 09, 2005 Jkt 020541 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\042005\20541 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

38

humans  can  be  subjected  to  unknown  kinds  of  exposures  that  we
haven’t  even  thought  of  as  of  yet  that  we  should  be  looking  at  in
terms of safety and long-term safety, whether it is intercontinental,
high-speed,  supersonic  travel  or  orbital  space  flights?  What  would
be your reaction to that?

Mr.  RUTAN.  Well,  there  is  nothing  that  is  unknown  about  what
we  are  going  to  put  humans  exposed  to  in  order  to  have  this  sub-
orbital  industry  grow  and  be  healthy.  We  know  all  of  the  answers
to  those  things.  They  are  very  straightforward.  They  are  very  ac-
ceptable,  and  they  are—you—by  the  way,  you  do  want  to  expose
someone to forces in order for it to be fun. And the—there are now
showstoppers  out  there  at  all.  Now  as  we  move  on  and  go  to  the
planets where you have long-term exposure to radiation and so on,
there are serious things that need solutions, but that is not for the
work  that  we  are  likely  going  to  be  doing  this  decade.  That  is  the
next step. But I don’t see any roadblocks at all on technologies, and
I don’t—I do not believe we need any research work done at NASA
to  support  the  sub-orbital  private  space  flight  industry.  I  believe
when  the  private  space  flight  industry  moves  to  taking  people  to
the  moon  and  the  planets,  NASA  will  be  a  very  strong  player,  be-
cause  they  do  need  to  get  back  into  their  role  of  doing  basic  re-
search  rather  than  running  the  airline.  And  I  see  a  big  role  for
NASA as we go to low-Earth orbit, and particularly as we go above
low-Earth  orbit.  And  I  think  Mr.  Musk  will  comment  more  on  his,
because  he  is  working  on  orbit,  and  we  are  not.  But  for  this  new
industry that we have been developing here on this panel, we don’t
see a role at all for NASA.

Mr.  WHITEHORN.  If  I  can  just  add  to  that,  very  quickly.  I—one
of  the  things  we  are  working  with  the  FAA  at  the  moment  is  the
guidelines. And one of the guidelines is that we explain to the cus-
tomers  exactly  what  the  risks  are.  And  those  risks  are  known,  so
the risk of——

Mr. HONDA. Oh, okay.
Mr.  WHITEHORN.—gamma  radiation,  for  example,  will  be  ex-
plained  to  the  customers.  And  you  know,  you  are  talking  about  a
level of risk of a CT scan for a flight on a sub-orbital craft.

Mr. HONDA. So you have research on that, then?
Mr.  WHITEHORN.  There  is  plenty  of  research  on  it,  which  goes
back decades now. And the research in the airline industry and the
research that was done around the introduction of Concord back in
the  1970s  is  all  perfectly  relevant  to  this  particular  situation.  I
mean,  the  only  risks  we  don’t  know  about  is,  you  know,  the  possi-
bility  that  we  might  meet  aliens  since  there  will  be  several  thou-
sand flights rather than just a few hundred over 40 years.

Mr. HONDA. Well, that is a buzzword in this country.
Thank you.
Chairman CALVERT. Thank you.
Mr. Wu.
Mr. WU. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
I  have  a  couple  of  questions,  but  I  just  want  to  start  by  saying
that,  you  know,  my  dad  was  in  the  aerospace  industry.  By  then,
the  industry  was  already  fairly  mature,  and  names  like  Northrop
and  Boeing  were  institutions  rather  than  individuals,  but  by  hav-
ing  an  affection  for  whatever  field  I  am  in,  I  dig  into  the  history.

39

And  it  was  interesting  for  me  to  find  the  individuals  behind  those
institutions,  and  that  was  a  romantic  era  when  the  founders  of
these great institutions were first starting their businesses.

RETURN-TO-FLIGHT

I  want  to  salute  you  all  for  your  cutting-edge  work,  and  I  truly
believe  that  Mr.  Whitehorn,  Mr.  Rutan,  you  and  Mr.  Branson  will
be  remembered  in  the  aerospace  pantheon  with  the  likes  of  Jack
Northrop and others, and I really want to recognize that.

And  Mr.  Rutan,  it  was  a  long  time  ago,  but  I  made  a  200-mile
drive  to  see  Voyager  land  in  the  Mojave  Desert,  and  that  was  one
of  the  great  moments  of  my  life  to  see  that  aircraft  come  in.  It  is
just  really  terrific.  I  try  to  explain  its  significance  to  my  son  when
we see it at the Air and Space Museum. He is less than completely
impressed right now, but I think—he is seven, and——

Mr. RUTAN. I believe the Voyager pilot is with us in the audience

today, too, my brother, Dick.

Mr.  WU.  Well,  you  flew  it  really  nice,  straight,  and  level  all  of
the  way  in.  And  you  did  walk  away  from  the  landing,  which  is  a
very good thing. Thank you. It is very, very impressive.

I really want to ask you all a couple of questions apart from com-
mercial  space  and  what  you  have  been  working  on,  because,  you
know,  sometimes  in  the  course  of  your  work  and  your  extensive
background, you can shed valuable light on other organizations and
other  processes.  And  the  two  things  I  wanted  to  check  with  you
about are really NASA and federal programs.

As  you  know,  the  launch  window  for  the  next  Shuttle  opens  ap-
proximately May 15, and I was wondering if either of you, particu-
larly  Mr.  Rutan,  but  either  of  you,  have  any  commentary  as  you
have  observed.  I  mean,  I  know  you  all  have  been  very  busy,  but
if you have observed the NASA return to space—return to flight ef-
forts,  if  you  have  any  observations  to  share  with  us.  And  then  I
have one other question after that.

Mr.  RUTAN.  Well,  I  feel  very  privileged  to  have  an  appointment
this  afternoon  with  the  new  NASA  Administrator,  even  though  he
has only been on the job a couple of days. So I believe there is like-
ly  going  to  be  major  changes  on  what  we  believe  is  ahead,  and  I
would prefer to not guess, at least until I have had a chance to give
him my thoughts and to have a better idea of what is likely to hap-
pen  at  NASA.  But  I  believe  there  will  be  major  changes  in  what
NASA’s  activities  were  otherwise  going  to  be  because  Mike  Griffin
is  on  board.  So  I  really  don’t  think  it  would  be  appropriate  for  me
to guess on that until I have a little more information.

Mr. WHITEHORN. I would like to make a general comment.
I  think  it  is  incredibly  important  for  the  future  of  space  that
NASA returns to space flight. I think there is an enormous psycho-
logical impact. And you know, one of the comments that was made
earlier was about in education. When I was brought up as a young
lad  in  Scotland,  my  parents  told  me  that  I  would  probably  go  to
space when I grew up and that they wouldn’t be alive to see it, but
I would. The generation beyond my generation grew up not believ-
ing they would ever go to space. They ceased to believe it, because
the  whole  attitude  to  space  became,  ‘‘Robots  will  do  it,  because  ro-
bots  are  going  to  be  cheaper,’’  and  scientists  decided  that  robots

were  where  space  was  going.  And  to  be  honest  with  you,  the  psy-
chological impact of that around the globe was that people actually
stopped believing in the whole idea of the exploration of space, be-
cause  why  do  human  beings  want  to  pay  through  their  tax  dollars
to  fund  something  that  they  are  never  going  to  get  the  chance  to
ever  experience  themselves?  However,  science  has  moved  on.  Our
understanding  of  our  own  planet  has  moved  on  enormously  in  the
last  20  years,  and  people  have  realized  that  our  tenure  on  this
planet  is  pretty  limited,  that  you  know,  there  will  be  catastrophic
events  that  could  damage  civilization  itself,  and  that  they  happen
on  a  more  regular,  say,  precept  than  we  had  thought  of  30  or  40
years ago.

So  the  idea  that  we  can’t  ever  leave  this  planet  is  a  psycho-
logically damaging one to the whole concept of civilization, develop-
ment, and science and technology itself. So not only is this private
sector  venture  incredibly  important,  but  also  NASA’s  return  to
space  flight  is  incredibly  important,  and  I  think  we  should  laud
them  for,  hopefully,  what  will  be  a  great  event  around  May  the
15th or shortly afterwards. And it was interesting, my son went to
see  SpaceShipOne  the  Christmas  before  last.  And  he  went  back  to
his school in England, and the schoolteacher was asking, ‘‘What did
you  do  in  the  Christmas  holidays?’’  of  all  of  the  boys  in  the  class
and  the  girls  in  the  class.  And  he  said  he  had  been  to  see  the
spaceship  and  his  dad  might  be  building  one.  And  the  science
teacher  sent  him  out  of  the  class.  And  the  difference  between  two
years ago and now is that he has had a letter of apology about that
and—thanks  to  Burt  succeeding  in  the  X–Prize,  and  also,  you
know, if you look at the attitude to space at the moment, the inter-
est  there  was  in  the  Mars  mission,  because  this  government  an-
nounced  that  you  were  going  to  intend  to  go  to  Mars  with  human
beings, and the worldwide coverage of the Mars Explorer last year
was  dramatically  different  to  the  previous  coverage  of  the  early
missions  to  Jupiter,  for  example,  in  the  late  ’80s  and  early  ’90s,
which didn’t attract that much public interest or attention. The fact
that  human  beings  are  going  out  beyond  this  planet  is  the  incred-
ibly  important  principle  that  NASA  has  to  re-establish  and  it  is
doing so now, which is to be lauded.

Mr. WU. Thank you very much.
And  Mr.  Chairman,  with  your  forbearance,  if  I  can  get  out  my

second question.

The—if—and I look forward to hearing, Mr. Rutan, your observa-
tions  in  private  after  you  have  had  your  meeting.  And  Mr.
Whitehorn,  I  completely  agree  with  you  about  the  importance  of
NASA’s return to flight. It has tremendous symbolic as well as real
significance,  and  I  think  the  whole  Nation,  the  whole  world,  will
be holding its breath. And that is why it is so important.

NASA AERONAUTICS

The  other  thing  that  gets  a  whole  lot  less  attention  and  that  is
that  we  talk  all  of  the  time  about  space,  but  we  forget  about  the
aeronautics mission of NASA. And I was wondering if either of you
have  views  about  whether  NASA  has  under-emphasized  its  aero-
nautics mission perhaps at the expense of either American competi-
tiveness or world aviation.

Mr.  RUTAN.  Well,  before  NASA,  there  was  NACA.  And  NACA
did,  indeed,  support  the  industry  by  providing  wind  tunnels  and
providing  basic  research,  really  very  well  focused  on  the  kinds  of
things  that  a  manufacturer  would  need  in  order  for  him  to  go  out
and  build  an  airplane  and  compete  and  to  build  the  industry.
NACA never did run an airline. NASA now is running the only air-
line  that  America  has  in  space.  So  it  is  a  considerably  different
thing. I don’t think just by throwing more funding to NASA you are
going to get help on the aeronautics. I think you are going to have
to  be  specific,  and  you  are  going  to  have  to  identify  the  resources
that  NASA  has  for  aeronautics,  which  one  of  the  wind  tunnels  are
critical,  and  the  ones  that  are  critical  need  to  be—remain  open  so
that the developers all of the way down to—all of the up from Boe-
ing  and  all  of  the  way  down  to  Scaled  Composites  can  use  these
facilities,  because  they  are  national  assets  that  we  have  spent
money for.

In  general,  though,  in  terms  of  the  research  done  at  the  indi-
vidual  level,  say,  calculations  and  so  on,  at  NASA,  what  has  hap-
pened is because the airline industry and the military airplane de-
velopment industry is so competitive, you will look inside Northrop
and Boeing and so on and you will find better skills there of these
technologies  than  you  find  looking  inside  the  labs  at  NASA.  So  I
am  not  a  proponent  of  keeping  a  lot  of  that  alive  if  it  is  not  some-
thing  that  flows  good  information  out  to  the  U.S.  manufacturers.
I  don’t  see  a  benefit  there.  But  I  think  at  least  on  the  short  term,
we have got to make sure that the wind tunnels that are important
and  the  assets  that  are  important  that  the  government  owns,  that
they not be just thrown away.

Mr. WHITEHORN. I would agree with Burt’s testimony.
I  would  also  add  that  I  think  one  of  the  issues  that  NASA  has
had to face over the last 45 years is that it really hasn’t had a clear
output specification of what it should be doing from government on
behalf  of  the  people  of  the  States.  I  mean,  it  is,  to  me,  very,  very
interesting  that  NASA  had—if  you  look  at  the  1970s  and  1980s,  it
was  very  direction-less  for  a  long  period  of  time.  And  it  was  also
part  of  a  Cold  War  that  existed  between  the  Soviet  Union  and  the
USA,  and  people  forget  that  these  days.  It  was  forced  to  do  things
by  government  by  using  tax  dollars,  which  were  part  of  the  Cold
War itself, rather than part of the exploration of space. And I think
NASA, for the first time in, probably, two decades, has a very clear
direction  at  the  moment,  but  it  mustn’t  be  thinking  in  that  clear
direction about the mechanics of achieving it using the ideas of the
past.  It  mustn’t  get  stuck  into  the  rut  of,  ‘‘Well,  we  have  got  to  do
this so we have got to build this type of rocket, because that is the
way you do it.’’ It should really be thinking about, you know, if the
best way to do it is to build something out of paper mache and send
it  into  space,  because  that  will  work  more  effectively  and  be  more
cost-effective and safer, then that is the way we should think about
doing  it.  And  I  think  that  attitude  and  that  cultural  change  in
NASA  you  can  definitely  see  happening  at  the  moment  from  the
outside.

Chairman  CALVERT.  I  thank  the  gentleman.  I  thank  the  gen-

tleman for his questions.

Mr.  WU.  I  thank  the  witness,  and  I  thank  the  Chairman  for  his

forbearance.

Chairman CALVERT. Okay. We are spending a little more time on
this panel than we expected, but it is very interesting. Mr. Bartlett
has joined us. Does the gentleman have any other questions or——
Mr. BARTLETT. I am sorry I couldn’t have been here for the whole

hearing. Thank you all very much for coming.

Are  you  making  an  argument,  maybe,  that  you  ought  to  be—we
ought  to  be  rethinking  NASA  and  its  mission  when  you  note  that
the aeronautical area has—now has large companies, very competi-
tive, that are able to attract skills that it is difficult for the govern-
ment to match? I have a general philosophy that government needs
to  be  only  where  they  need  to  be,  and  if  we  don’t  need  to  be  in  an
area, maybe we shouldn’t be there.

Mr. RUTAN. Well, I don’t think that it is NASA’s role to do devel-
opment,  and  I  don’t  think  it  is  NASA’s  role  to  run  an  airline  or  a
spaceline.  I  think  it  is  NASA’s  role  to  do  basic  research  to  dis-
cover—to  allow  the  discovery  of  breakthroughs.  The  problem  that
we have is if you define research, like I think it should be defined,
and  that  is  if  there  is  something  out  there  that  you  are  trying  to
achieve and you want to put funding in to achieve it, if half of the
people that look at that goal look at it from the standpoint of, ‘‘Oh,
man,  that  is  tough.  And,  God,  it  would  be  neat  if  you  could  do  it,
and  I  think  you  can  do  it.’’  And  then  the  other  half  of  the  tech-
nologies  looked  at—technologists  look  at  that  and  they  say,  ‘‘Well,
hell,  that  is  impossible.’’  Okay.  I  believe  at  that  level,  then  to  go
after  it,  you  are  doing  research.  But  if  everybody  says,  ‘‘Oh,  yeah,
that  will  work,  and  we  are  just  here  to  kind  of  refine  it,’’  then  all
you  are  doing  is  development.  And  that  is  my  argument  with  this
exploration  program  now  is  they  are  not  out  there  looking  for  the
breakthroughs.  They  are  not  out  there  looking  for  things  that  can
make big differences. They are really—NASA is doing development,
because  NASA,  in  general,  and  it  may  be  somewhat  of  things  im-
posed by them by accident committees. It may be some things that
are imposed on it by you folks who pass out their money. But they
just  flat  are  scared  to  death  of  failure,  and  if  they  are  scared  to
death of failure, you are incapable of doing research. I think NASA
ought  to  be  funded  to  do  research  to  support  America’s  airline  in-
dustry  and  America’s  military  development  industry,  and  that
means  that  most  of  what  they  do  are  things  that  are  expected  to
fail. And that takes a whole different culture and a whole different
idea. That is what NASA ought to do.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  I  come  from  a  science  background.  I  appreciate
very much your understanding that there is no unsuccessful experi-
ment.

Mr. RUTAN. Right.
Mr. BARTLETT. If it doesn’t work, that is a success. You learn——
Mr. RUTAN. Right.
Mr.  BARTLETT.—that  it  doesn’t  work,  so  you  have  got  to  try

something else next time.

Mr.  RUTAN.  And  if  you  are  afraid  to  fly  it,  you  never  learn  any-

Mr.  BARTLETT.  That  is  right.  You  know,  and  people  who  don’t
come  from  a  science  background  have  a  lot  of  trouble  under-

thing.

standing that, that there is no unsuccessful experiment. If it didn’t
work, it didn’t work, so we will try something else next time.

But  for  people  who  are—who  want  to  avoid  failure,  they  see  an
experiment  that—where  you  didn’t  prove  your  hypothesis,  where
the data did not support your hypothesis, they see that as a failure,
and  so  they  don’t  want  to  do  it.  And  when  you  have  that  kind  of
timidity, you are not going to push the envelope very far very fast.
Mr. RUTAN. The X–34 is a very good example. Here is something
that  was  funded  all  of  the  way  through,  essentially  ready  to  fly,
and then was not flown because it was deemed to be risky. And you
know  what  happened  shortly  after  we  had  some  failures  in  some
Mars  missions,  and  they  decided,  ‘‘Listen,  we  don’t  like  it,  because
it  is  risky,  so  we  don’t  fly  it.’’  And  that  is,  essentially,  what  hap-
pened. If they had have flown that and made a smoking hole in the
desert,  you  would  learn  something  from  it.  When  you  don’t  fly  it,
you  have  wasted  all  of  your  money  and  you  have  defined  certain
failure of your goals.

Mr. BARTLETT. I appreciate your concern.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
I  certainly  thank  this  panel.  Mr.  Rutan,  again,  congratulations

for your accomplishments.

Mr.  Whitehorn,  thank  you  for  putting  some  risk  capital  behind

this, and that is what entrepreneurship is all about.

I  am  going  to  have  a  question—a  couple  of  questions,  one  that
I  will—because  we—in  the  interest  of  time,  about  the  long-term
prospects  for  space  tourism  on  full  orbital  flights.  And  if  I  can  put
that  in  writing  to  you  and  get  a  written  response  what  kind  of
technologies need to be developed and what do you see is a timeline
for something like that.

With  that,  again,  thank  you  very  much  for  your  testimony.  It  is
very  interesting.  We  have  spent  more  time  on  this  than  we
thought, but you were very kind to stay here, and it was very inter-
esting for us. Thank you very much.

Mr. RUTAN. Thank you.
Chairman CALVERT. Okay. Our next panel: Mr. Elon Musk is the
CEO  and  Chief  Technology  Officer  for  Space  Exploration  Tech-
nologies,  SpaceX;  Mr.  John  W.  Vinter  is  Chairman  of  the  Inter-
national  Space  Brokers,  ISB;  Mr.  Wolfgang  Demisch,  the  founder
of  Demisch  Associates,  LLC,  Aerospace  Financial  Analyst;  and  Dr.
Molly Macauley, Senior Fellow and Director of Academic Programs
at Resources for the Future.

Of  course,  Mr.  Musk  is  known  for  inventing,  what  is  it,  PayPal
and  very  successful  and  now  is  investing  his  money  in  something
that is even more interesting, and that is space exploration.

With  that,  Mr.  Musk,  we  are  going  to  try  to  stay  on  our  tradi-
tional  schedule  now  of  five  minutes  of  testimony  and  five  minutes
for  questions.  We  kind  of  let  that  go  with  the  last  panel,  but  we
are going to stick to it this time.

So  Mr.  Musk,  thank  you  very  much  for  coming,  and  you  may

begin your testimony.

Panel II:

STATEMENT OF MR. ELON MUSK, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, SPACE

EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGIES (SPACEX)

Mr. MUSK. All right. Thank you. There we go. All right.
Chairman  Calvert,  distinguished  Members  of  the  Committee,

thank you for having me here. It is an honor to be here.

I will address the questions as directly as possible.
The first one is: ‘‘What is the SpaceX business plan?’’
SpaceX  is  dedicated  to  improving  the  reliability  and  cost  of  ac-
cess to space for the greater purpose of helping us become a space-
faring civilization one day. Without dramatic improvement in those
two  inseparable  metrics,  cost  and  reliability,  we  will  never  exceed
the great deeds our Nation accomplished for all humanity with the
Apollo program.

Although  the  ultimate  goal  of  SpaceX  is  to  provide  heavy-lift,
super-heavy lift, in fact, and manned launch vehicles, we have cho-
sen to focus our initial efforts on a small rocket capable of launch-
ing satellites to low-Earth orbit. This vehicle, the Falcon I, is effec-
tively  a  sub-scale  technology  test  bed,  ensuring  that  the  inevitable
areas  of  development  occur  at  a  small  scale  and  without  people  on
board.

However, the Falcon I, which has the lowest cost per flight in the
world,  and  is  entirely  American  built,  is  also  showing  strong  mar-
ket demand in its own right. We already have three firm contracts
for launch and expect to close another two before Falcon I performs
its  maiden  flight  later  this  year.  Once  Falcon  I  has  a  few  flights
under  its  belt  and  the  satellite  producers  have  time  to  adjust,  I
think  it  is  quite  possible  that  there  will  be  more  flights  of  Falcon
I than any other orbital launch vehicle in the world.

It is also worth noting that the Falcon I is the only semi-reusable
rocket  in  the  world,  apart  from  the  Space  Shuttle.  However,
reusability  is  not  currently  factored  into  the  price.  As  we  refine
that  process,  we  may  be  able  to  make  further  cost  reductions  and
hope to make further cost reductions in the cost per flight of Falcon
I.  As  far  as  reliability  is  concerned,  the  Futron  Corporation,  which
is used extensively by NASA and the FAA, concluded that the Fal-
con  I,  despite  being  low  cost,  had  the  second  highest  design  reli-
ability  of  any  American  rocket.  It  was  tied  with  the  most  reliable
version  of  the  Boeing  Delta  IV  and  Lockheed  Atlas  V.  The  highest
design reliability rank was held by our Falcon V design, which will
be the only American rocket that can lose any engine or motor and
still complete its mission, which I think is really quite crucial.

The  Falcon  V,  scheduled  for  first  flight  next  year,  is  a  medium-
lift  rocket  designed  to  carry  people  as  well  as  satellites.  As  such,
the design margins will meet or exceed the NASA requirements for
manned  spacecraft.  In  fact,  my  current  instruction  to  the  design
crew is that they exceed the NASA specs. My hope is that this ve-
hicle will provide the United States with an all-American means of
transporting  astronauts  to  orbit  and  ensure  that  we  are  beholding
to no one once the Space Shuttle retires.

All  in  all,  I  see  an  increasingly  positive  future  for  commercial

space activities over the next five to 10 years.

45

But  what  should  the  government  do  or  not  do  to  encourage  the

nascent commercial space industry?

The  most  important  thing  that  the  government  should  do  is
adopt  a  nurturing  and  supportive  attitude  towards  new  entrepre-
neurial  efforts.  In  particular,  the  government  should  seek  to  pur-
chase  early  launches  as  well  as  offer  prizes  for  concrete  achieve-
ments.  Evidence  for  the  tremendous  power  of  prizes  can  be  found
throughout history, most recently, obviously, with the X–Prize and
the best evidence being the prior panel.

Regarding  purchasing  early  launches,  the  Defense  Department
has  been  very  supportive  and  has  done  the  right  thing  at  every
level,  purchasing  two  of  the  four  launches  we  have  sold  to  date.
But regrettably, NASA has not yet procured a launch and has pro-
vided less financial support than the Malaysian Space Agency, who
has bought and paid for a flight on Falcon I.

However,  I  am  very  much  heartened  by  the  recent  confirmation
of Dr. Griffin as the new NASA Administrator. I am confident that
his outstanding technical ability, dedication, and diverse experience
will  invigorate  our  space  program.  With  a  finite  budget  and  en-
trenched interests to fight, Dr. Griffin will be forced to make some
difficult decisions in the year ahead. I urge Congress to give its full
support to Dr. Griffin when he does so.

As far as what the government should not do, I think it is impor-
tant  to  minimize  the  regulatory  burden  required  for  space  launch
activities.  And  a  comment  made  by  Mr.  Rohrabacher  early  on  re-
garding  the  ITAR  rules  and  having  ITAR  apply  only  to  certain
countries  and  not  to  others  with—you  know,  we  are  in  close  mili-
tary alliance, I think makes a lot of sense. But right now, we have
the  greatest  difficulty  just  dealing  with  people  from  New  Zealand
and  from  the  UK  and  from  Canada.  I  mean,  for  goodness  sake,  it
just  becomes  a  bit  silly.  I  really  think  we  need  to—there  is  an  ur-
gent need for reform in that area. I think, unfortunately, the Amer-
ican industry is really being harmed by this. And so it—but in gen-
eral,  we  should  do  no  more  than  is  necessary  to  protect  the  unin-
volved  public,  I  think,  as  far  as  regulation  is  concerned.  It  some-
times  seems  to  me  that  our  society  is  paving  the  road  to  hell  one
regulation at a time.

And  are  there  implications  for  the  commercial  space  industry  as
you  see  it  in  the  President’s  announced  Vision  for  Space  Explo-
ration?

Well, the NASA budget is unlikely to see significant increases in
years  ahead,  and  in  fact,  will  face  severe  pressure  from  entitle-
ments  just  when  we  really  need  to  spend  money  on  the  moon  and
Mars  in,  say,  10  or  20  years.  Compounding  the  problem,  U.S.
launch  prices  have  been  increasing  every  year.  So  this  places
NASA in a financial vice, a continually tightening financial vice.

Unless  we  can  reverse  the  trend  of  rising  costs,  we  are  going  to
accomplish less and less every year. So therefore, the only way that
our  country  can  meet  the  President’s  Vision,  or  really,  any  inter-
esting objectives in space, is to encourage the development of new,
low-cost  access  to  space.  If  we  can’t  afford  to  get  there,  the  Vision

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ELON MUSK

Chairman  Calvert  and  distinguished  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for
inviting me to testify today on Future Markets for Commercial Space. It is an honor
to be here.
What is the SpaceX Business Plan?

SpaceX is dedicated to improving the reliability and cost of access to space for the
greater  purpose  of  helping  us  become  a  true  space-faring  civilization.  Without  dra-
matic improvement in those two inseparable metrics, we will never exceed the great
deeds our nation accomplished for all humanity with the Apollo program.

Although  the  ultimate  goal  of  SpaceX  is  to  provide  super-heavy  lift  and  manned
launch vehicles, we have chosen to focus our initial efforts on a small rocket capable
of  launching  satellites  to  low-Earth  orbit.  This  vehicle,  the  Falcon  I,  is  effectively
a  sub-scale  technology  test  bed,  ensuring  that  the  inevitable  errors  of  development
occur on a small scale and without people on board.

However, the Falcon I, which has the lowest cost per flight in the world for a pro-
duction  rocket  and  is  entirely  American  built,  is  also  showing  strong  market  de-
mand  in  its  own  right.  We  already  have  three  firm  contracts  for  launch  and  expect
to close another two before Falcon I performs its maiden flight later this year. Once
the  Falcon  I  has  a  few  flights  under  its  belt  and  the  satellite  producers  have  time
to adjust, I think it is quite possible that there will be more flights per year of Fal-
con I than any other vehicle in the world.

It  is  also  worth  noting  that  the  Falcon  I  is  the  only  semi-reusable  rocket  in  the
world,  apart  from  the  Space  Shuttle.  However,  reusability  is  not  currently  factored
into the price. As we refine that process, the cost of Falcon I will decline over time.
As  far  as  reliability  is  concerned,  the  Futron  corporation,  which  is  used  extensively
by NASA and the FAA, concluded that Falcon I had the second highest design reli-
ability of any American rocket. It was tied with the most reliable version of the Boe-
ing  Delta  IV  and  Lockheed  Atlas  V.  The  highest  design  reliability  rank  was  held
by  our  Falcon  V  design,  which  will  be  the  only  American  rocket  that  can  lose  any
engine or motor and still complete its mission.

The Falcon V, scheduled for first flight next year, is a medium lift rocket designed
to  carry  people  as  well  as  much  larger  satellites.  As  such,  the  design  margins  will
meet or exceed NASA requirements for manned spacecraft. My hope is that this ve-
hicle will provide the United States with an all American means of transporting as-
tronauts to orbit and ensure that we are beholden to no one once the Shuttle retires.
All in all, I see an increasingly positive future for commercial space activities over

the next five to ten years.
What  should  the  government  do  or  not  do  to  encourage  the  nascent  com-

mercial space industry?

The  most  important  thing  that  the  government  should  do  is  adopt  a  nurturing
and supportive attitude towards new entrepreneurial efforts. In particular, the gov-
ernment should seek to purchase early launches as well as offer prizes for concrete
achievements. Evidence for the tremendous power of prizes can be found throughout
history, most recently with the X–Prize.

Regarding purchasing early launches, the Defense Department has been very sup-
portive  and  has  done  the  right  thing  at  every  level,  purchasing  two  of  the  four
launches  we  have  sold  to  date.  Regrettably,  however,  NASA  has  not  yet  procured
a launch and has provided less financial support than the Malaysian Space Agency,
who has bought and paid for a flight on Falcon I.

However,  I  am  very  much  heartened  by  the  recent  confirmation  of  Dr.  Griffin  as
the new NASA Administrator. I am confident that his outstanding technical ability,
dedication  and  diverse  experience  will  invigorate  our  space  program.  With  a  finite
budget  and  entrenched  interests  to  fight,  Dr.  Griffin  will  be  forced  to  make  some
difficult decisions in the years ahead. I urge Congress to give its full support to Dr.
Griffin when he does so.

As far as what the government should not do, I think it is important to minimize
the  regulatory  burden  required  for  space  launch  activities.  We  should  do  no  more
than  is  necessary  to  protect  the  uninvolved  public.  It  sometimes  seems  to  me  that
our society is paving the road to hell one regulation at a time.
Are  there  implications  for  the  commercial  space  industry  as  you  see  it  in

the President’s announced Vision for Space Exploration?

The  NASA  budget  is  unlikely  to  see  significant  increases  in  coming  years  and  in
fact  will  face  severe  pressure  from  entitlements  in  the  next  decade.  Compounding
the problem, U.S. launch prices from existing contractors are increasing every year,
sometimes significantly.

Unless we can reverse the trend of rising costs, NASA will be placed in a contin-
ually tightening financial vice, accomplishing less and less each year. Therefore, the
only  way  that  our  country  can  meet  the  President’s  Vision  in  a  meaningful  way  is
by  encouraging  the  development  of  new,  low  cost  access  to  space.  If  we  can’t  afford
to get there, the Vision will become nothing more than a mirage.

BIOGRAPHY FOR ELON MUSK

Elon  is  the  CEO  &  Chief  Technology  Officer  of  Space  Exploration  Technologies
(SpaceX), which is developing a family of launch vehicles intended to reduce the cost
and increase the reliability of access to space ultimately by a factor of ten. The com-
pany officially began operations in June 2002 and is located in the heart of the aero-
space industry in Southern California.

SpaceX is the third company founded by Mr. Musk. Prior to SpaceX, he co-found-
ed  PayPal,  the  world’s  leading  electronic  payment  system,  and  served  as  the  com-
pany’s Chairman and CEO. PayPal has over sixty-five million customers in 38 coun-
tries,  processes  tens  of  billions  dollars  per  year  and  went  public  on  the  NASDAQ
under  PYPL  in  early  2002.  Mr.  Musk  was  the  largest  shareholder  of  PayPal  until
the company was acquired by e-Bay for $1.5 billion in October 2002.

Before PayPal, Mr. Musk co-founded Zip2 Corporation in 1995, a leading provider
of  enterprise  software  and  services  to  the  media  industry,  with  investments  from
The New York Times Company, Knight-Ridder, MDV, Softbank and the Hearst Cor-
poration. He served as Chairman, CEO and Chief Technology Officer and in March
1999 sold Zip2 to Compaq for $307 million in an all cash transaction.

Mr. Musk’s early experience extends across a spectrum of advanced technology in-
dustries, from high energy density ultra-capacitors at Pinnacle Research to software
development  at  Rocket  Science  and  Microsoft.  He  has  a  physics  degree  from  the
University  of  Pennsylvania,  a  business  degree  from  Wharton  and  originally  came
out to California to pursue graduate studies in high energy density capacitor physics
& materials science at Stanford.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman for his testimony.
Mr. Vinter.
If the gentleman would turn on his microphone.

STATEMENT OF MR. JOHN W. VINTER, CHAIRMAN,

INTERNATIONAL SPACE BROKERS

Mr. VINTER. Yes.
Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you.  Members  of  the  Sub-

committee, good morning as well.

My  name  is  John  Vinter,  Chairman  of  International  Space  Bro-
kers.  Our  office  is  in  Rosslyn,  and  we  have  subsidiary  offices  in
London and Paris. I am pleased to testify before the Subcommittee.
My  company  represents  a  ‘‘who’s  who’’  of  satellite  users,  includ-
ing,  in  the  U.S.,  Intelsat,  XM  Satellite  Radio,  Worldspace,  AT&T,
Bigelow, Kistler, and SpaceX. Additionally, we represent SES Astra
in Luxembourg, Telesat Canada, New Skies Satellites in the Neth-
erlands,  Optus  in  Australia,  Star  One  in  Brazil,  and  Singapore
Telecom.  We  have  also  managed  the  third-party  liability  program
for the Shuttle when they were flying commercial missions.

I  am  also  the  Chairman  of  COMSTAC,  the  DOT’s  Commercial

Space Transportation Advisory Committee.

You have asked me today to address three questions: ‘‘What kind
of  activities  does  your  company  include  for  insurance  purposes  in
its definition of commercial space?’’ ‘‘As insurance brokers, what do
you  see  as  the  outlook  for  commercial  space  activities  in  the  next
five  years,  10  years?  How  do  you  think  we  should  avoid  exagger-
ated  expectations  in  the  industry,  such  as  those  that  occurred  in
the  low-Earth  orbit  market  in  the  late  1990s?’’  and  finally,  ‘‘What,
if anything, should the government do or not do to encourage com-
mercial space endeavors?’’

48

With  respect  to  commercial  space,  we  include  any  space  activity
which does not directly involve the U.S. Government as an insured.
We  address  satellite  insurance  and  risk  management  needs  from
‘‘cradle to grave.’’

For  us,  commercial  space  begins  with  the  arrival  of  people  or
equipment  at  the  various  launch  sites,  continues  through  launch,
deployment,  testing,  and  on-orbit  operations  of  satellites  through
the  end  of  their  expected  lives.  These  are  the  areas  of  risk  where
we  spend  the  majority  of  our  time  and  where  satellite  owners
spend  the  majority  of  their  insurance  money.  The  launch  itself  is
generally the riskiest and most expensive phase of any commercial
space  endeavor.  In  simple  terms,  our  objective  is  to  cover  the  risk
of  loss  or  damage  to  the  satellites,  including  failure  of  the  launch-
ers or failure of the satellite to work according to the specifications.
In general, as a comment, the market wishes to see successful first
flights before insuring.

We  also  provide  liability  coverage  for  damages  to  third  parties
caused  by  launch  and  related  activities  and  accidents.  Again,  com-
mercial space insurance begins with arrival of equipment or people
at  the  launch  site  and  continues  through  on-orbit  operations.  As
with  the  satellite  coverage  above,  activities  prior  to  arrival  at  the
launch site are best covered in non-space insurance markets.

We  also  insure  persons,  for  example,  astronauts,  tourist  visitors
to the Space Station, and individuals who have flown on the Shut-
tle.  We  also  can  insure  various  contingencies  such  as  acts  of  gov-
ernments, and yes, we could probably even insure a space prize.

As  insurance  brokers,  what  do  you  see  the  outlook  for  commer-

cial space in the next several years?

We see space activities evolving and growing, albeit not very fast.
The  world’s  satellite  manufacturers  and  launch  vehicle  providers
have considerable excess capacity. There does not seem to be suffi-
cient demand to absorb this excess in the near future. For the next
several  years,  we  think  there  will  be  approximately  15  to  20  com-
mercial  launches  a  year.  We  see,  however,  more  human  activities
in  space,  the  X–Prize  being  the  first,  and  no  doubt  the  America’s
Prize  will  be  the  second.  And  other  incentive  programs  I  am  sure
will generate an increase in activities.

I hope Mr. Rutan and Mr. Whitehorn, the other gentleman from
Virgin  Galactic,  are  widely  successful  and  very  active.  The  insur-
ance  community  will  be  there  for  them,  but  it  still  remains  to  be
seen.

What, if anything, should the government do?
Well,  with  respect  the  government  involvement  to  encourage
space  endeavors,  I  offer  the  following.  I  would  suggest  the  govern-
ment  maintain  the  current  liability  risk-sharing  regime  of  private
insurance,  government  indemnification  in  excess  of  private  insur-
ance,  and  cross  waivers.  This  regime  was  established  in  the  late
’80s  and  was  renewed  last  year  for  an  additional  five-year  period.
This  system,  in  my  judgment,  is  working  very  well.  It  has  been
adopted by non-U.S. launch organizations. I know there are doubt-
ers,  but  I  believe  this  is  very  essential  to  the  commercial  launch
business in the U.S.

I  also  would  recommend  we  take  another  look  at  the  Inter-
national  Traffic  in  Arms  Regulations  as  regards  to  commercial

49

space to see if they really achieve what they are meant to achieve.
We  handle  these  matters  for  some  of  our  clients,  and  the  people
who  review  the  matters  for  licensing  and  monitoring  are  doing  an
excellent  job  and  in  a  very  timely  fashion.  The  practical  impact  is
not so clear. From the insurance point of view, this is an essential
area, because o of the insurance market is located outside the coun-
try,  and  it  appears  that  the  same  underwriters  show  up  on  every
program,  but  they  have  to  be  individually  cleared  for  every  pro-
gram.  I  believe  that  the  U.S.  industry  would  benefit  if  the  process
can  be  streamlined.  I  should  also  point  out  the  whole  process  is
pushing satellite business overseas as non-U.S. operators find it in-
creasingly difficult to cope with the whole process.

I  believe  the  use  of  government  ranges  and  government  pur-
chases  of  commercial  space  services,  where  feasible,  seems  to  be
working well. I would, of course, defer to others, such as Mr. Musk,
for their comments.

In this age of deficit spending, I would be hesitant to recommend
additional  public  spending,  but  perhaps  it  could  be  considered  by
way of providing seed money for promising new technology.

This  concludes  my  testimony.  I  will,  of  course,  be  pleased  to  an-

swer any questions. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN W. VINTER

My name is John Vinter, Chairman of International Space Brokers, Inc. My office
is in Rosslyn, VA, and we have subsidiary offices in London and Paris. I am pleased
to testify before the House Committee on Science, Subcommittee on Space and Aero-
nautics.

My  company  represents  a  ‘‘Who’s  Who’’  of  satellite  users,  including  the  following:
In  the  U.S.,  Intelsat,  XM  Satellite  Radio,  Worldspace,  AT&T,  Bigelow,  and  SpaceX.
Additionally,  we  represent  SES  Astra  in  Luxembourg,  Telesat  Canada,  New  Skies
Satellites  in  the  Netherlands,  Optus  in  Australia,  Star  One  in  Brazil,  Singapore
Telecom  in  Singapore,  and  others.  We  also  have  managed  the  Shuttle  third  party
liability insurance program for NASA.

I  am  also  the  Chairman  of  COMSTAC,  the  Department  of  Transportation’s  Com-
mercial  Space  Transportation  Advisory  Committee,  advising  the  FAA’s  commercial
space  transportation  office.  In  my  career,  I  have  been  fortunate,  in  separate  career
phases,  to  work  for  both  a  satellite  company  having  the  need  for  insurance  as  well
as  an  underwriter  company  providing  insurance  coverages.  Today,  I  am  a  broker
representing  the  above  mentioned  clients,  and  others,  in  the  purchase  of  insurance
from  the  international  space  insurance  market.  You  have  asked  me  to  address  the
following questions:

1. What kind of activities does your company include for insurance purposes in

its definition of ‘‘commercial space’’?

2. As  insurance  brokers,  what  do  you  see  as  the  outlook  for  commercial  space
activities in the next five years? Next 10 years? How do you think we should
avoid exaggerated expectations for the industry, such as those that occurred
in the low-Earth orbit (LEO) market in the late 1990s?

3. What,  if  anything,  should  the  Government  do  or  not  do  to  encourage  com-

mercial space endeavors?

What kind of activities does your company include for insurance purposes

in its definition of ‘‘commercial space’’?

With respect to ‘‘commercial space’’ activities, we include any space activity which
does  not  directly  involve  the  U.S.  Government  as  an  insured.  We  address  satellite
insurance and risk management needs from ‘‘cradle to grave.’’

For  us,  commercial  space  begins  with  the  arrival  of  people  or  equipment  at  the
various  launch  sites,  continues  through  launch,  deployment,  testing,  and  on-orbit

owners  spend  the  majority  of  their  insurance  money.  The  launch  itself  is  generally
the  riskiest  and  most  expensive  phase  of  any  commercial  space  endeavor  to  insure.
In  simple  terms,  our  objective  is  to  cover  risks  of  loss  or  damage  to  the  satellites,
including failure of the launchers, or failure of the satellite to work according to its
specifications.

We  also  provide  liability  coverage  for  damages  to  third  parties  caused  by  launch
related  and  satellite  operational  accidents.  Again,  commercial  space  insurance  cov-
erage  begins  with  the  start  of  launch  site  activities  and  continues  through  on-orbit
operations.  As  with  the  satellite  coverage  above,  activities  prior  to  arrival  at  the
launch site are best covered in non-space insurance markets.

We also ensure persons, for example, the lives of various astronauts and tourists/
visitors  to  the  Space  Station,  including  individuals  who  fly  or  have  flown  on  the
Shuttle.

From  time  to  time,  we  also  insure  contingencies  such  as  acts  of  government,  and

other causes, that could affect the ability to launch for various reasons.
As insurance brokers, what do you see as the outlook for commercial space
activities in the next five years? Next 10 years? How do you think
we  should  avoid  exaggerated  expectations  for  the  industry,  such
as those that occurred in the low Earth orbit (LEO) market in the
late 1990s?

As brokers, we see space activities evolving and growing, albeit not very fast. The
world satellite manufacturers and launch vehicle providers have considerable excess
capacity at the moment. There does not seem to be sufficient demand to absorb this
excess  in  the  near  future.  For  the  next  several  years,  it  would  appear  there  will  be
approximately  15  to  20  commercial  launches  per  year.  We  see,  however,  more
human  activities  in  space,  the  X–Prize  being  the  first  of  what  is  expected  to  be  a
significant increase in the number of humans going into space. I have no doubt that
the  America’s  Prize,  and,  hopefully,  other  incentive  programs  will  generate  an  in-
crease in activities, although it is hard to determine how long this will take.

Going into space is expensive and involves significant risk. The implications of the
low-Earth  orbit  projects  in  the  late  ’90s  adversely  affected  the  financial  markets.  I
have  no  doubt  that  the  financial  community  will  demand  sound  business  plans  be-
fore advancing significant sums of money. As it is well known, space is very exciting
and will be the subject of much discussion. Unfulfilled expectations can’t be avoided.
I do not know whether a solution will exist to deal with the ups and downs of expec-
tations. Perhaps getting together with the insurance industry for their opinions may
be of value in minimizing the potential financial risks.
What,  if  anything,  should  the  government  do  or  not  do  to  encourage  com-

mercial space endeavors?

With respect to government involvement to encourage space endeavors, I offer the

following thoughts.

I would suggest the government maintain the current liability risk sharing regime
of  private  insurance/government  indemnification  in  excess  of  private  insurance  and
cross  waivers.  This  regime  was  established  in  the  late  1980s  and  was  renewed  last
year for an additional five-year period (P.L. 108–428). This system, in my judgment,
is working very well and has been adopted by non-U.S. launch service organizations.
I  know  this  regime  has  doubters  but  failure  to  maintain  this  regime,  I  believe,  in
the long run could significantly harm the U.S. commercial launch business.

I  would  also  recommend  that  the  International  Traffic  In  Arms  Regulations,  as
regards to commercial space activities, be reviewed to see if they really achieve what
they are meant to achieve. We handle these matters for some of our clients and the
people who review such matters for licensing and monitoring are doing an excellent
job  and  in  a  very  timely  fashion.  The  practical  impact  of  these  regulations  should
be  noted.  From  the  insurance  point  of  view,  it  is  important  to  recognize  that  two
thirds  of  the  market  is  located  outside  of  the  country  and  the  same  underwriters
appear  on  most  of  the  programs.  It  could  benefit  U.S.  industry  if  the  ITAR  process
can  be  streamlined.  However,  I  should  point  out  the  whole  process  is  pushing  sat-
ellite  business  overseas  as  non-U.S.  operators  find  it  increasingly  difficult  to  cope
with the process, particularly, in a tough competitive environment.

I  believe  the  use  of  government  ranges  and  government  purchases  of  commercial
space  related  services,  where  feasible,  seems  to  be  working  well.  I  would  defer  to
others for their comments in this regard.

In this age of deficit spending, I would be hesitant to recommend additional public
expenditure for commercial space projects but perhaps it could be considered by way
of providing seed money for promising new technology and so forth.

Professional Background:

BIOGRAPHY FOR JOHN W. VINTER

John Vinter is Chairman of International Space Brokers, Inc. (ISB). He has been
involved  with  virtually  all  aspects  of  satellite  business  for  over  thirty  years.  Mr.
Vinter  was  appointed  to  the  Department  of  Transportation’s  Commercial  Space
Transportation Advisory Committee (COMSTAC) in January 2000. In July 2003, he
was  appointed  as  COMSTAC  Chairperson  by  FAA  Administrator,  Marion  Blakey
and assumed the official duties of Chair at the last meeting in October 2003.

Mr.  Vinter  founded  ISB  in  February  1991,  in  conjunction  with  three  prominent
insurance  brokerage  organizations.  Since  its  founding,  ISB  has  consistently  main-
tained a 30–40 percent market share in this business.

From March 1984 to February 1991, Mr. Vinter was responsible for the space un-
derwriting  activities  for  INTEC  (now  AXA  Space).  INTEC  was  the  underwriting
manager  for  CIGNA  and  a  large  number  of  insurers  and  re-insurers  worldwide.  As
Executive  Vice  President,  Mr.  Vinter  was  lead  underwriter  for  many  of  the  world’s
major  programs.  His  underwriting  activities  were  such  that  INTEC  was  able  to
achieve  an  underwriting  profit  six  out  of  seven  years  and  a  market  share  of  20–25
percent.

From  August  1976  until  February  1984,  Mr.  Vinter  held  a  variety  of  positions
with Satellite Business Systems where he was Director of Administration, Contracts
and  Procurement.  In  this  capacity  he  was  responsible  for  Satellite  Business  Sys-
tems’  business  transactions  involving  contractual  relationships  with  its  customers,
contractors,  insurers  and  launching  agencies.  He  was  also  responsible  for  the  risk
management function of the company. In connection with this activity he negotiated
the  contract  for  the  first  HS–376  satellite  as  well  as  the  first  commercial  Shuttle
launch services agreement with NASA for which he then purchased the first Shuttle
third party liability and launch insurance.

From  July  1968  to  August  1976,  Mr.  Vinter  held  a  number  of  management  posi-
tions within Communications Satellite Corp. in which he was responsible for the ne-
gotiation, procurement and administration of major satellite and ground system pro-
curements.
Education:

John  Vinter  has  an  A.B.  degree  in  Economics  from  Georgetown  University  and  a
M.S. degree in Telecommunications Operations from George Washington University.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. Demisch, you may begin your testimony.

STATEMENT OF MR. WOLFGANG H. DEMISCH, PRESIDENT,

DEMISCH ASSOCIATES, LLC

Mr. DEMISCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  and  honored
guests,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today.
My name is Wolfgang Demisch. I am a principal in Demisch Asso-
ciates LLC, a financial consultantcy in the aerospace sector.

You  have  asked  me  to  address  the  outlook  of  the  commercial
space  launch  business  as  well  as  to  forecast  when  space  would  at-
tract classic risk-reward investors to succeed the ‘‘angel’’ investors,
such  as  Paul  Allen,  who  funded  SpaceShipOne  that  we  see  today.
The  goal  is  to  help  the  Committee  recommend  what  the  Congress
could  or  should  do  to  encourage  commercial  space  endeavors  as
called for in the NASA charter.

Your  hearings  come  at  a  challenging  time  for  commercial  space.
The  benefits  of  commercial  space  are  just  embedded  in  the  econ-
omy.  They  are  taken  for  granted  by  anybody  who  goes  for  a  hike

years,  essentially  all  of  the  world’s  civil  communications  fleet  has
changed  hands  for  an  aggregate  price  roughly  equal  to  one-year
NASA  budget.  That  has  been  a  disappointing  return  for  the  inves-
tors,  and  that  is  without  factoring  the  costs  of  things  like  Iridium
or Beale or Kistler. The only consolation is the buyers are probably
a  roll  call  of  the  smartest  investors  in  the  world,  people  like  KKR
and  Carlyle  and  Apollo,  and  clearly,  they  see  outstanding  risk-re-
ward in space right now, and but notably in the space communica-
tion segment.

The  fact  that  there  are  smart  buyers  for  space  communication
doesn’t  change  the  reality  that  access  to  space  remains  too  costly
for most commercial endeavors. Price per pound to low-Earth orbits
in  the  $10,000  class,  essentially  unchanged  from  the  $1,000  a
pound achieved by the Saturn V in the 1970s. That translates, inci-
dentally,  on  a  tourism  basis,  directly  into  the  $20  million  a  head
paid  by  the  guys  who  flew  on  the  Russian  boosters,  and  I  might
note  that  that  was  a  bargain.  They  didn’t  pay  for  life  support.  If
NASA  were  to  do  the  same  thing,  if  Congress  was  encouraging
them,  they  would  probably  have  to  charge  five  to  eight  times  as
much.

So  I  think  the  message  is  space  launch  is  on  a  much  lower  pro-
ductivity  track  than  microelectronics  or  computing,  and  that  is  de-
spite  Congress’s  long-term  funding  support  of  new  space  launch
technology:  the  reusable  Shuttle,  the  commercially-derived  EELV.
No  savings  were  achieved.  I  am  unaware,  regrettably,  of  any  cred-
ible proposal for substantial cost reductions. The propulsion break-
through,  which  I  think  would  be  necessary  in  the  technical  basis
to  achieve  such  a  breakthrough,  isn’t  in  sight.  I  think  it  would  be
prudent  to  set  policy  on  the  basis  that  no  substantial  launch  cost
reductions are to be expected.

It  will  stay  expensive  until  we  get  something  like  the  proposed
space  elevator  that  Clarke,  among  others,  has  written  about.  I
think  that  is  a  plausible  technology,  and  so  I  enthusiastically  ap-
plaud  NASA’s  Centennial  Challenge  program,  which  will  help  mo-
bilize the need of talents and materials and power technology that
would  underpin  that  kind  of  a  transformation.  And  I  think  that  is
worthy  of  your  support,  but  in  the  interim,  I  think  it  will  remain
uneconomic  to  send  up  anything  other  than  information  up  and
down  from  space.  Absent  some  astonishingly  serendipitous  dis-
covery,  a  cancer  cure,  for  instance,  space  access,  I  think,  would
grow in line with the general economy.

And  I  think  the  more  promising  approach  to  improving  the  effi-
ciency  of  space  flight  is  to  accept  that  it  is  hugely  costly;  about  10
pounds  of  space  payload  is  equal  to  one  man  year  at  current  engi-
neering  rates,  and  at  that  price,  it  is  really  worthwhile  to  invest
to  shrink  the  payload  weight  that  is  needed  to  perform  a  specific
task.  NASA  has  used  this  technique  with  pretty  good  success  to
trim the mission costs of its interplanetary probes. And while it has
limitations,  because,  you  know,  antenna  size  and  also  people  don’t
scale  down  like  they  might,  nevertheless,  it  is  pretty  powerful,  es-
pecially when you combine several satellites in the station keeping
system to ambulate the performance of a bigger platform. There is
lots  of  space  for  better  improvement:  better  batteries,  better  solar
cells, lighter structures, more efficient communications, and has di-

rect spinout both to the military as well as eventually to the larger
economy. I think that that kind of effort deserves your support.

In  general,  I  have  to  say  Congress  has  been  consistently  sup-
portive of commercial space. It has shied away from the kind of di-
rect  operating  incentives  we  saw  in  the  beginning  of  the  civil  air
transport  industry,  but  nevertheless,  Congress  has  been  very  gen-
erous. I consider, for instance, you know, the duopoly allocation for
the  satellite  radio  business  or,  for  that  matter,  the  enormous  fre-
quency  allocation,  which  was  granted  Teledesic  when  they  had
their broadband project, and those kind of in-kind supports that is
essentially  the  modern  day  equivalent  of  land  grants  to  the  rail-
roads that financed the transcontinental railroads in the 19th cen-
tury.  I  think  it  is  important,  but  I  think  it  is  inadequate,  to  cata-
lyze a major new industry of the scope and stability that is needed
to transform commercial space into the kind of risk-reward investor
as opposed to ‘‘angel’’ investor area that you are seeking. Commer-
cial space today is centered on communications and broadcasts and
the  new  broadcasts  are  being  brought  into  service,  like  XM  Radio
and  Sirius,  and  as  that  happens,  existing  services,  like  DirectTV,
get  forwarded  into  larger  media  powerhouses  and  the  investment
feasts  on  those  enterprises  is  not  controlled  by  the  space  invest-
ment. It is controlled by other factors.

I do think there are other drivers for commercial space initiatives
that  respond  to  Congressional  mandates  regarding  national  secu-
rity,  for  instance.  It  is  interesting  that  right  now  there  is  no  effec-
tive  surveillance  of  the  millions  of  containers  that  flow  across  our
borders.  In  fact,  industry  can’t  even  find  about  B  of  them.  So  the
TSA  and  Customs  have  begun  to  institute  some  monitoring.  These
are  big  boxes,  you  know,  I  mean,  sort  of  house-sized,  able  to  con-
tain  anything,  germ  warfare  labs.  The  monitoring  doesn’t  really
watch these trailer-sized structures either while they are in transit
or  when  they  are  in  the  U.S.  There  are  proposals  for  satellites  to
offer  that  capability  to  maintain  that  watch  worldwide.  It  requires
each  container  be  equipped  with  a  suitable  black  box  that  checks
its  status  and  reports  intrusions.  And  once  that  is  there,  there  is
also,  of  course,  obvious  commercial  spin-offs  from  that.  You  can
monitor  the  environment.  You  can  monitor  the  temperature.  You
can  check  the—see  that  the  product  quality  is  maintained.  When
you have a container of beer and it goes to 160 degrees, it is prob-
ably not going to be good beer. But it also gives you a straight com-
mercial payoff. You can include the documentation for fast Customs
clearance.

That  kind  of  monitoring,  I  think,  will  be  routine  in  the  decade,
because  it  responds—is  driven  by  a  pressing  security  need.  There
are  other  initiatives,  for  example,  to  switch  a  lot  more  of  the  air
traffic  control  to  satellite-based  navigation  and  communications.
That  will  take  longer.  But  I  think  that  getting  the  infrastructure
support,  which  provides  steady  and  reliable  revenues,  that  is  the
kind  of  thing  risk-reward  investors  seek  and  will  accept.  I  think
that may begin the transition the Committee is talking about.

Thank  you  for  your  attention.  I  am  available  for  any  questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF WOLFGANG H. DEMISCH

Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  honored  guests.  Thank  you  very
much  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today.  My  name  is  Wolfgang
Demisch,  I  am  a  principal  in  Demisch  Associates  LLC,  a  financial  consultancy  ori-
ented  towards  the  aerospace  sector  and  I  have  been  active  in  aerospace  financial
matters since the early 1970’s.

You  have  asked  me  to  address  the  outlook  for  the  commercial  space  launch  busi-
ness,  as  well  as  to  forecast  when  space  would  attract  classic  risk-reward  investors
to  succeed  the  ‘angel’  investors  we  see  today,  investors  such  as  Paul  Allen,  who
funded the Spaceship 1 development. The goal is to help the Committee recommend
what the Congress could or should do to encourage commercial space endeavors, as
called for in the NASA charter.

Your  hearings  come  at  a  challenging  time  for  commercial  space.  While  the  bene-
fits  of  commercial  space  are  now  so  embedded  in  our  economy  that  they  are  taken
for  granted  by  anyone  who  goes  on  a  hike  with  a  GPS,  to  give  just  one  example,
they have not been well rewarded in the financial arena. To highlight the problem,
over  the  past  four  years,  the  bulk  of  the  world’s  civil  communications  satellite  fleet
has changed hands, for an aggregate price roughly equal to one year’s NASA budget.
This  represents  a  disappointing  return  to  the  industry  sponsors;  even  without  fac-
toring in the additional losses on restructured projects such as Iridium or the costs
of  now  quiescent  launch  ventures  such  as  Beale  or  Kistler.  The  consolation,  if  any,
is  that  the  buyers,  firms  such  as  KKR,  Carlyle  and  Apollo,  are  almost  a  roll  call
of  the  world’s  most  astute  investors.  Their  actions  demonstrate  that  they  see  out-
standing  risk-reward  value  in  commercial  space,  notably  the  communications  seg-
ment, where substantial purchases could be made.

That commitment to space based communications however does not invalidate the
painful  reality  that  access  to  space  remains  too  costly  for  most  commercial  endeav-
ors.

At  present,  the  price  per  pound  to  low  Earth  orbit  is  in  the  $10,000/lb  class,  de-
pending on the vehicle. It is not much changed, on an inflation adjusted basis, from
the  roughly  $1000/lb  achieved  by  the  Saturn  V  booster  in  the  1970’s.  Today’s  price
translates readily into the $20 million fare paid to Russia by the first space tourists,
who  arguably  got  a  bargain,  as  their  life  support  and  training  was  included.  NASA
would have to charge several times as much to cover its costs, if the Congress were
ever to encourage such a use of NASA’s fleet.

Clearly space launch costs are on a much lower productivity track than the micro-
electronics  or  computing  sectors.  This  is  so  despite  Congress’  solid  support  of  cost
reduction efforts, first with the reusable Space Shuttle, then with the commercially
derived EELV, neither of which achieved the savings anticipated. Regrettably, I am
unaware of any credible proposal to achieve the desired substantial cost reductions.
The propulsion breakthrough, which would be a prerequisite for a much better cost
performance, is not in sight. Hence it would seem prudent to set policy on the basis
that no substantial launch cost reductions are to be expected.

Access  to  space  will  stay  expensive  until  we  can  achieve  something  like  the  pro-
posed  space  elevator  that  Arthur  C.  Clarke,  among  others,  has  written  about.  This
seems a plausible technology. Consequently, I enthusiastically applaud NASA’s Cen-
tennial  Challenge  program,  which  will,  I  believe,  help  mobilize  the  needed  talents
to realize the materials and power technologies that underpin such a transformative
capability.  This  effort,  although  still  far  from  fruition,  is  worthy  of  your  consider-
ation in my view.

In  the  interim,  perhaps  for  the  next  two  or  three  decades,  it  will  remain  uneco-
nomic  to  send  anything  other  than  information  up  into  or  back  down  from  space.
This suggests that absent some astonishingly serendipitous discovery, a cancer cure
for instance, entry to space will grow about in line with the general economy, rather
than  some  multiple  thereof.  It  also  suggests  that  there  is  not  much  to  be  gained
from an effort to force feed the launch sector

A  more  promising  approach  to  improving  the  economic  efficiency  of  space  flight,
in my opinion, is to accept that space payload is hugely costly, 10 pounds per man-
year at current engineering rates. At that price, it is worthwhile to invest to shrink
the  payload  weight  needed  to  perform  the  desired  task.  NASA  has  used  this  tech-
nique with considerable success to trim the mission cost of its interplanetary probes.
While  the  approach  has  limitations,  because  of  antenna  size  and  power  require-
ments,  because  of  packaging  constraints  as  well  as  because  of  people  life  support
needs  for  manned  systems,  it  is  surprisingly  powerful,  especially  when  considering
that several smaller spacecraft can cooperate to emulate the performance of a larger
platform.  There  is  plenty  of  scope  for  payload  improvement,  including  better  sen-
sors,  more  efficient  solar  cells  and  batteries,  lighter  structures  and  more  efficient

communications.  The  product  applications  exists  in  the  broader  defense  market  as
well  as  in  space,  plus  such  improvements  eventually  find  application  in  the  larger
economy.  While  unglamorous,  such  initiatives  are  well  suited  to  the  NASA  culture
and likewise deserve your continued support.

Congress has been consistently supportive of commercial space. While it has thus
far  shied  away  from  the  kind  of  aggressive  operating  incentives  that  early  in  the
last century helped bring the national air transport system into existence, Congress
has  been  generous,  even  beyond  the  massive  launch  vehicle  investments.  For  in-
stance,  Congress  allowed  duopoly  positions  for  the  satellite  radio  business,  just  as
it  blessed  the  enormous  frequency  allocation  granted  Teledesic  to  support  their
space based broadband project.

Such  in  kind  support,  reminiscent  of  the  land  grants  that  financed  the  trans-
continental railroads in the 19th century, remains an important component for com-
mercial space ventures, but appears inadequate to catalyze major new industries of
the scope and stability needed to transform commercial space into a risk-reward in-
vestor’s area of interest. Commercial space enterprises are currently centered on the
communications and broadcast sectors. While there have been new services brought
into  being  here,  most  recently  the  direct  radio  broadcasters  Sirius  and  XM  Radio,
others such as DirecTV have been acquired by larger media powerhouses. For these
entities, space is a minor component of the overall investment thesis.

There may however be other drivers for commercial space, initiatives that respond
to  Congressional  mandates  regarding  national  security  for  instance.  For  example,
there  is  not  at  present  any  effective  surveillance  of  the  millions  of  containers  that
flow  across  our  borders.  While  the  TSA  and  U.S.  Customs  have  begun  to  institute
some  monitoring,  both  at  the  point  of  origin  as  well  as  at  the  port  of  entry,  there
is  no  watch  on  these  trailer  sized  structures  while  in  transit  or  while  in  the  U.S.
Satellites offer the capability to maintain that watch worldwide, provided each con-
tainer is equipped with a suitable black box that checks its status and reports intru-
sions. This type of self-assessment is of course readily extended to include measure-
ments  of  commercial  interest,  such  as  temperature  or  vibration,  which  then  facili-
tates  better  product  quality  control,  as  well  as  of  course  electronic  documentation
for faster and easier customs clearance.

Such  monitoring  will,  in  my  view,  be  a  matter  of  routine  within  the  decade,  be-
cause  it  responds  to  a  more  pressing  security  need.  Other  initiatives,  for  instance
to shift much more of the air traffic control responsibility to satellite based naviga-
tion  and  communications  links,  will  take  longer  to  achieve  broad  acceptance.  How-
ever,  services  such  as  these,  providing  critical  infrastructure  support,  appear  to  be
the  kind  of  reliable  revenue  generators  that  risk-reward  investors  eagerly  accept.
They may begin the transition the Committee asked about.

Thank you for your attention.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  MOLLY  K.  MACAULEY,  SENIOR  FELLOW
AND  DIRECTOR,  ACADEMIC  PROGRAMS,  RESOURCES  FOR
THE FUTURE
Dr. MACAULEY. Thank you.
Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  Members  of  this  sub-

committee. Thank you for the opportunity to join you today.

Much  of  the  discussion  this  morning  has  centered  on  getting
things and people into space. I have been asked to broaden discus-
sion  a  bit  to  consider  these  as  well  as  other  kinds  of  activities  in-
cluded in the commercial space industry. I have also been asked to
discuss  U.S.  leadership  in  these  activities,  and  probably  most  im-
portant, the role of government, including what government should
not do in encouraging commercial space.

My written comments address all of these three topics, and they
have  some  very  specific  discussion  of  past  regulatory  and  legisla-
tive initiatives, the legislative initiatives taken and spearheaded by
this  subcommittee.  And  the  testimony  also  has  some  detailed  dis-
cussion about directions for the future.

So,  in  the  interest  of  time,  I  will  just  summarize  the  general

themes here.

And I offer my comments with a great deal of humility. I am not
a pioneer in building space technology and making a business work
like  my  colleagues  this  morning.  So  I  offer  my  comments  with  hu-
mility.  What  I  and  other  analysts  try  to  do,  though,  is  innovate  in
the  case  of  public  policy.  And  actually,  in  the  past  couple  of  years,
there  has  been  a  great  deal  of  innovation  in  public  policy  in  the
U.S.  Government  at  the  Federal,  State,  and  local  level,  and  these
have direct applicability to space policy making.

Generally,  they  are  incentive-based  approaches.  They  generally
work.  They  generally  work  well.  In  particular,  what  they  try  to  do
is  to  minimize  the  costs  imposed  on  industry,  but,  at  the  same
time,  do  some  of  the  things  government  is  supposed  to  do,  such  as
protecting the environment to some degree, providing some reason-
able amount of worker or consumer safety, generally provide oppor-
tunities  but  without  dictating  choice,  and  in  short,  to  balance  the
interests of the taxpayer with specific interests of industry.

So  some  of  these  examples  of  policy  innovations,  say,  in  the  last
decade  have  been  highly  successful  tradable  permits  in  the  case  of
industries  that  have  to  meet  environmental  regulation,  auctions  of
portions  of  the  electromagnetic  spectrum  by  the  Federal  Commu-
nications  Commission  to  improve  access  to  and  use  of  spectrum,
vouchers to permit consumer choice, the move towards performance
standards  meeting  a  level  of  overall  performance  rather  than  gov-
ernment dictating exactly how every nut and bolt used by industry
should  comply  with  safety  regulations,  and  of  course  the  role  of
prizes and cash incentives.

I  think  it  is  very  important  to  point  out  that  government  policy
making  for  space  in  the  form  of  Congressional  legislation,  again
spearheaded  by  this  subcommittee  in  the  past,  as  well  as  some
presidential  policy  directives  and  some  regulation  of  various  com-
mercial  space  activities  has,  in  many  cases,  already  promulgated
incentive-based  policies  like  these.  We  already  have  on  the  books
some  provisions  for  space  transportation  vouchers.  In  some  cases,
we  are  moving  towards  performance  standards.  There  are  provi-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 06:47 Dec 09, 2005 Jkt 020541 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\042005\20541 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

sions  for  government  purchases  of  Earth  and  space  science  data
and  space  transportation  services  and  now,  most  recently,  we  are
experimenting  with  prizes.  In  all  cases,  the  statutory  intent  has
been to support commercial space.

Now to be sure, not all of these initiatives have worked. The ex-
ample  perhaps  most  notable  is  the  attempt  to  transfer  to  commer-
cial  operations.  But  the  policy  experiments  are  being  attempted.
And in terms of government’s future role, I recommend that a phi-
losophy  of  incentives  like  these  and  sometimes  established  as  ex-
perimental  or  demonstration  policy  programs,  the  counterparts  to
technology pathfinders underlie future approaches.

In  the  interest  of  quickly  summarizing  my  other  comments,  let

me use two examples.

The  first.  Recently  Google  joined  with  a  company  called  Keyhole
to  offer  three-dimensional  maps  on  our  PCs  and  our  BlackBerrys
for  finding  things  ranging  from  street  directions  to  restaurants  to
ATM  machines.  For  some  neighborhoods,  these  maps  are  so  de-
tailed,  you  can  see  your  neighbors’  trashcans.  But  the  real  advan-
tage  of  Google  and  Keyhole  is  that  the  maps  are  easy  to  use  and
they are very well annotated. Even though the underlying satellite
imagery  and  aerial  photography  data  can  consist  of  many
terabytes,  they  are  very  complicated  to  manipulate  and  geographi-
cally rectify these data, and they are very hard for a consumer not
trained  in  photogrammetry,  let  alone  map  reading,  to  understand.
The factors, then, are these: ease of use, low-cost ease of use, anno-
tation,  and  a  corporate  partnership  that  brings  with  it,  ready-
made, a large consumer market.

The second example. A newcomer to commercial space is satellite
radio,  XM  and  Sirius.  They  had  to  obtain  FCC  licenses  and  fre-
quency allocations, contract for commercial launch services and in-
surance, obtain permits for and then install and maintain an initial
network of hundreds of terrestrial repeaters for ground coverage in
drop-out  areas.  They  also  had  to  design  and  test  radio  antennae
and  in-car  technology.  Then  they  had  to  attract  GM,  Honda,  Sony,
Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Circuit City, and RadioShack for their supply
and  market  chains.  And  they  still  weren’t  done.  They  needed  pro-
gramming.  They  needed  content.  So  they  are  signing  up  Major
League  Baseball,  NASCAR,  CNN,  Fox  News,  and  Howard  Stern,
literally hundreds of kinds of programs.

The points of these examples are these.
Businesses can succeed or fail despite of or independent of space
policy.  Commercial  space  success  depends  as  much  on  the  usual
business challenges: strategy, customer relations, contracting prac-
tices,  understanding  consumer  markets,  as  on  challenges  that  are
space  unique.  Space  businesses  also  depend  on  innovation  in  non-
space commercial markets, like electronics, information technology,
entertainment,  automobiles,  retail  services.  And  space  businesses
also  face  policies  related  to  export  restrictions,  as  have  been  men-
tioned  earlier,  national  security  concerns,  and  regulation  in  finan-
cial, environmental, occupational, and employment sectors.

And a good space policy, I think, will be familiar with these other
pressures  brought  to  bear  on  our  U.S.  industry  to  understand  the
big picture of what space business in this context is all about.

So  in  conclusion,  I  would  just  like  to  say  that  I  think  to  confer
with the titans of space industry, as we have done today, is essen-
tial for good policy making. It may also be useful to confer with ti-
tans  in  other  types  of  U.S.  industries  that  are  directly  related  to
the  success  of  our  space  businesses.  And  finally,  good  space  policy
is  necessary,  but  it  won’t  always  be  sufficient  for  business  success
nor at fault for business failure.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MOLLY K. MACAULEY

Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee  on  Science,  Sub-
committee  on  Space  and  Aeronautics.  I  am  Molly  K.  Macauley,  a  Senior  Fellow  at
Resources for the Future (RFF), a research organization established in 1952 and lo-
cated  here  in  Washington,  DC.  RFF  is  independent  and  nonpartisan,  and  it  shares
the  results  of  its  policy  analyses  with  members  of  all  parties  in  the  executive  and
legislative  branches  of  government,  as  well  as  with  business  advocates,  academics,
members  of  the  press,  and  interested  citizens.  My  comments  today  represent  my
own  views,  it  should  be  noted,  and  not  those  of  RFF,  which  takes  no  institutional
position on legislative or regulatory matters.

My  training  is  in  economics  and  I  have  worked  as  a  space  analyst  for  20  years.
I  have  written  extensively  about  space  economics  and  policy,  serve  on  numerous
NASA  and  National  Academy  of  Science  panels,  and  have  had  the  opportunity  to
meet  with  your  committee  several  times  in  past  years.  Thank  you  for  the  oppor-
tunity to meet with you today, Mr. Chairman. I am honored to be part of this distin-
guished panel. Moreover, I am grateful that you are seeking perspectives about the
role of government in space commerce.

I’ve  been  asked  to  consider  these  topics:  the  kinds  of  activities  included  in  ‘‘com-
mercial space;’’ U.S. leadership in these activities and the outlook during the coming
years  for  the  industry;  and  the  role  of  government,  including  what  government
should not do in encouraging commercial space.

My  overall  observation  is  that  U.S.  commercial  space  policy  to  date  has  been  ap-
propriately supportive of U.S. industry and sets a good precedent for the future. The
interests  of  the  taxpayer  and  industry  are  most  likely  to  flourish  mutually  by  way
of  a  conservative  approach  to  legislative  and  regulatory  intervention,  coupled  with
an  innovative,  incentive-oriented  philosophy.  I  also  recommend  the  usefulness  of
demonstration or pathfinder, experimental approaches to policy.
WHAT  KINDS  OF  ACTIVITIES  ARE  INCLUDED  IN 

‘‘COMMERCIAL

SPACE?’’

Some  of  the  promise  of  commercial  space  has  been  more  than  realized,  accom-
panied by new and perhaps unexpected consumer markets. Some promise has been
less successful, often for a variety of reasons independent of government actions.

Looking backward for just a moment is useful. A decade ago, the Wall Street Jour-
nal  and  USA  Today  had  vastly  expanded  their  geographic  distribution  by  a  new
method:  using  satellites  to  transmit  the  papers  to  local  printing  presses  across  the
country  for  early  morning  publication.  The  satellite  distribution  technology  was  so
novel  that  the  papers  included  at  the  top  of  their  front  page,  ‘‘Via  Satellite,’’  to  im-
press  upon  readers  that  the  news  was  hot  off  the  press  even  if  the  news  had  origi-
nated  thousands  of  miles  away.  A  much  more  routine  use  of  space  by  the  commer-
cial  media  was  the  satellite  pictures  of  cloud  cover  and  hurricanes  on  the  daily  TV
news.  In  another  routine  use  of  space,  telecommunications  companies  routed  some
long-distance  telephone  calls  by  way  of  satellite,  although  microwave  or  undersea
fiber  optic  cable  sent  most  calls.  Satellites  also  enlarged  the  market  for  cable  tele-
vision.  Sometimes  to  the  dismay  of  neighbors,  many  consumers  had  erected  large
satellite  dishes  in  their  yards  to  receive  cable  TV.  Reflecting  the  by-then  wealth  of
experience  of  commercial  satellite  makers  in  serving  these  markets,  Fortune  maga-
zine,  in  its  list  of  ‘‘100  Things  America  Makes  Best,’’  included  communications  sat-
ellites by Boeing.

In  another  related  market,  the  satellites  supplying  these  services  were  commer-
cially launched, fueling the commercial space transportation industry. In other mar-
kets, some bulky, expensive, and complex global positioning satellite (GPS) receivers
were finding use in ground surveying and in navigation for civil aviation. The entre-
preneurs  proposing  the  first  commercial  remote  sensing  space  system  worked  with
policy-makers  to  forge  entirely  new  regulatory  and  legislative  policy  to  obtain  li-

censes  for  their  service  and  were  preparing  for  launch.  There  were  also  business
plans  for  markets  in  space  burials  and  for  commercial  materials  processing  on  the
Shuttle and Space Station.

Today,  just  a  decade  later,  the  novelty  of  commercial  communications  satellites
has worn off so that the newspaper covers don’t remind readers of the transmission
technology (although the technology is still essential and new comsats are routinely
launched for existing and new services). Residential satellite dishes are much small-
er  and  hardly  noticeable  perched  on  apartment  balconies  and  corners  of  rooftops.
There  are  now  some  thirty-two  commercial  satellite  operators  around  the  world.
They support 176 million Americans for whom cell phones, pagers, BlackBerrys and
high-speed  connection  to  the  Internet  are  as  essential  as  a  morning  cup  of  coffee.
Most  of  these  services  use  at  least  some  satellite  relays  in  addition  to  terrestrial
network  technologies.  Backpackers  and  passenger  cars  carry  lightweight,  increas-
ingly  lower  cost,  and  highly  capable  GPS  receivers.  Satellite  radio  receivers  are  in
cars,  homes,  and  boats  and  hand-held  satellite  radios  accompany  joggers.  XM  Sat-
ellite  and  Sirius  Satellite  radio  companies  along  with  SpaceShipOne  are  the  most
prominent  among  new  entrants  in  commercial  space  markets.  XM  has  just  an-
nounced  that  it  is  also  joining  with  AOL  for  Internet  radio  service.  Both  XM  and
Sirius  point  out  that  after  eighty  years  of  AM  radio  and  sixty  years  of  FM  radio
technology, their digital technology offers the first new radio broadcast medium.

In the case of commercial space remote sensing, industry is struggling financially.
For  a  variety  of  reasons,  the  industry  has  had  trouble  building  a  civilian  consumer
market  and  has  instead  relied  heavily  on  sales  to  government,  including  contacts
for  data  purchases  by  the  National  Geospatial  Intelligence  Agency  and  other  na-
tional and foreign government security departments.

But  the  recent  acquisition  by  Google  of  Keyhole  Corporation,  a  California-based
digital mapping company, is a new and promising direction for remote sensing. Key-
hole  uses  satellite  and  aerial  maps  and,  most  important,  easy-to-use  software.  A
person (untrained in the complexities of photogrammetry) can zoom-in for detail on
satellite and aerial pictures by way of a personal or laptop computer and even simu-
late 3D maps to find hotels, parks, ATMs, and subway stops at home or when trav-
eling.  One  reviewer  noted  that  in  some  cases  a  consumer  can  even  zoom  in  enough
to see a neighbor’s trash cans. In remote sensing, then, companies are finally treat-
ing the market not as ‘‘users’’ but as ‘‘consumers.’’ Keyhole, together with the inno-
vative  software  known  as  Ajax  that  manages  the  complexity  of  all  of  the  data  and
interfaces  between  hardware  and  software  components,  simplifies  and  annotates
otherwise complicated digital imagery.

In  the  commercial  space  transportation  industry,  ideas  and  technology  have
moved  from  conventional  rockets  to  an  innovation  like  Sea  Launch,  and  from  un-
manned commercial vehicles to the promise of SpaceShipOne in serving payloads in
the form of people not packages.

These  examples  of  satellite  radio,  the  Google-Keyhole  arrangement,  and  innova-
tions in space transportation technology and markets represent a particular and sig-
nificant  development  relevant  to  Congressional  and  public  policy  perspectives  on
commercial space. This development is the hard work of industry in blending space-
based  technology  with  existing  technologies  and  markets  on  Earth,  complete  with
having  to  comply  with  the  regulations  that  govern  those  technologies  and  markets.
In  other  words,  commercial  space  is  not  a  stand-alone  industry  and  it  can  succeed
or fail on market conditions and other public policy wholly independent of commer-
cial space policy.

By  way  of  illustration,  satellite  radio  had  to:  obtain  FCC  licenses  and  frequency
allocations;  contract  for  commercial  launch  services  and  insurance;  obtain  permits
for and then install and maintain an initial network of 800 terrestrial repeaters for
ground  coverage  in  drop-out  areas;  design  and  test  radio,  antenna,  and  in-car  tech-
nology;  attract  GM,  Honda,  Sony,  WalMart,  Best  Buy,  Circuit  City,  and  Radio
Shack,  among  other  companies,  to  build  its  supply  and  market  chain;  and  sign  up
major  league  baseball,  NASCAR,  CNN,  Fox  News,  Howard  Stern,  and  other  pro-
gramming. No space technology has a stand-alone supply network or consumer mar-
ket.
U.S. LEADERSHIP IN COMMERCIAL SPACE—STATUS AND OUTLOOK

Most experts contend that some of the best commercial space products as well as
significant  innovation  continue  to  come  from  U.S.  companies.  But  these  observers
also acknowledge that ‘‘U.S.-made’’ can be misleading. For instance, companies rou-
tinely  employ  foreign-born,  U.S.  trained  engineering  talent.  In  addition,  increas-
ingly,  and  due  in  part  to  export  restrictions,  markets  are  typically  larger  for  U.S.-
made components rather than entire finished products.

Space-related markets are markedly more competitive than in past decades. Space
transportation  markets  now  include  suppliers  in  Europe,  China,  Russia,  Ukraine,
Japan,  and  India—all  now  offer  commercial  launch  services.  Israel  and  Brazil  also
have  their  own  launch  capability.  According  to  data  maintained  by  the  Office  of
Commercial  Space  Transportation  in  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration,  in  the
past ten years, the U.S. share of the worldwide commercial launch market has aver-
aged about 30 percent to 40 percent of total launches and about a third of total rev-
enue  (of  a  $1  billion  total  market  in  2004,  the  U.S.  share  was  about  $375  million).
The  total  number  of  launches  in  the  past  five  years  has  been  smaller  than  in  pre-
vious  years,  largely  due  to  longer-lived  satellites  and  a  decline  in  the  number  of
small satellites launched to nongeostationary orbit. For example, in 2004, U.S. com-
panies launched six out of a total of 15 worldwide commercial launches.

Joint  arrangements  between  U.S.  and  foreign  companies  are  increasing.  For  in-
stance,  Boeing  has  a  share  of  launch  revenue  from  its  partnership  in  Sea  Launch,
which  had  three  launches  valued  at  $210  million  in  2004.  In  commercial  remote
sensing,  U.S.  companies  have  entered  into  distribution  agreements  to  market  for-
eign data from SPOT and Radarsat.

The international mobility of engineering talent, increasing activity by other coun-
tries  in  commercial  space  launch  markets,  and  joint  arrangements  such  as  those
noted  above  are  trends  that  are  likely  to  continue  in  coming  years.  During  2004–
2013,  the  Office  of  Commercial  Space  Transportation  expects  a  total  of  about  23
commercial launches per year, on par with past years. Industry trends may include
continuing coupling of space-based and ground-based technologies and markets—the
‘‘XM’’  model.  Commercial  companies  have  also  proposed  the  first  commercial  deep
space science mission and commercial space operations and telemetry, tracking, and
control  systems.  In  the  case  of  Earth  observations,  a  major  initiative  impelled  by
the  G–8  heads  of  state  in  June  2003  has  led  to  a  ten-year  plan  for  an  integrated
global  Earth  observation  system  (GEOSS)  among  the  governments  of  more  than  30
countries.  A  separately  established  organization  is  working  closely  with  industry  to
identify opportunities to support GEOSS in the coming decade.
WHAT  MIGHT  GOVERNMENT  DO  (OR  NOT  DO)  TO  ENCOURAGE  COM-

MERCIAL SPACE?

The  Congress  and  executive  branch  have  generally  been  extremely  supportive  of
commercial  space.  The  legacy  of  policy  initiatives  to  nurture  the  industry  is  rich
with  examples.  Table  1  lists  key  legislation,  regulation,  and  policy  directives  that
have included provisions specifically addressing commercial space. These initiatives
have included (but not been limited to) a host of innovative, market-like approaches:
vouchers  to  fund  launch  purchases  by  space  science  researchers,  to  enable  them  to
choose  a  launch  vehicle  best  tailored  to  their  payload;  government  purchases  of
Earth  and  space  science  data  and  launch  services;  and  most  recently  in  the  Com-
mercial  Space  Launch  Amendments  Act  of  2004,  initial  steps  toward  allowing  pri-
vate and commercial passengers to undertake space travel.

The  twenty-year  legislative  and  regulatory  history  of  commercial  space  has  gen-
erally and been responsive to industry concerns. To be sure, not all initiatives taken
so  far  have  worked  in  practice.  For  example,  transferring  the  land  remote  sensing
system (Landsat) to private operation or identifying a commercial company to build
and operate a follow-on system (the Landsat Data Continuity Mission) did not work
out for a variety of reasons. However, the policy emphasis on data buys has formed
the basis for the purchases of commercial space remote sensing data under contracts
worth  about  $1  billion  with  national  security  agencies.  By  way  of  the  Centennial
Challenges  project,  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA)  is
now offering prizes for space technology development. NASA also has funding in its
FY  2006  budget  request  for  commercial  transportation  of  crew  and  cargo  to  the
International Space Station.

In the future, consideration could be given to potentially strong incentive-oriented
approaches  when  government  oversight  of  commercial  space  activities  is  deemed
necessary.  These  approaches  include  financial  incentives,  performance  standards
that  nurture  adoption  of  alternative  technologies  rather  than  requirements  that
specify technologies to achieve performance, rational pricing policy for access to gov-
ernment  assets,  and  reliance  on  private  markets  for  insurance  when  appropriate.
Table 2 lists market-like policies that have been taken or are currently used, or that
might be used in the future in designing space policy. These approaches include per-
formance  standards,  prizes,  private  market  insurance,  auctions,  voucher,  and  gov-
ernment  purchases  of  commercially  produced  goods  and  services.  The  objective  of

62

policy options such as these is to encourage flexibility, discourage government inter-
vention when private institutions (such as insurance markets) could suffice, and en-
sure  a  ‘‘fair  playing  field’’  between  government  space  and  commercial  space  activi-
ties.

I  know  from  Chairman  Calvert’s  recent  comments  at  the  21st  National  Space
Symposium  this  month  that  there  is  concern  about  sectors  of  the  U.S.  space  pro-
gram working in isolation from the others. These sectors would include the civil, na-
tional  security,  and  commercial  space  activities.  This  is  a  familiar  problem.  For  in-
stance,  in  the  case  of  energy  policy,  the  Department  of  Energy,  the  Federal  Energy
Regulatory  Commission,  the  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission,  the  National
Highway  Safety  Administration,  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  and  the
Minerals  Management  Service  all  have  great  influence  on  energy  markets.  These
agencies’  decisions  affect  what  fuels  are  used  to  generate  electricity,  what  fuel  effi-
ciency  targets  cars  must  meet,  what  mixtures  of  gasoline  may  be  sold,  and  where
oil and natural gas can be produced.

Our  space  and  space-related  agencies  now  range  from  the  national  security  com-
plex to NASA, the Department of Interior and the U.S. Geologic Service, the Depart-
ment  of  Commerce  and  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration,  the
Federal  Aviation  Administration,  and  the  Federal  Communications  Commission.
The Departments of State and Energy, together with the Department of Commerce,
are key champions of the GEOSS program (described above). The Department of En-
ergy also plays a role in space power systems.

To  some  extent,  our  space  sectors  have  mutually  benefited  from  this  mix.  For  in-
stance,  GPS  is  owned  and  operated  on  the  defense  side  but  routinely  used  by  the
civil  and  commercial  sectors.  Remote  sensing/Earth  observation  information  was
championed by NASA and the infrastructure, data, R&D, data validation, and infor-
mation  products  from  NASA’s  Earth  science  activities  over  four  decades  are  rou-
tinely  used  by  the  defense  and  commercial  sectors.  Commercial  satellite  tele-
communications were advanced markedly by industry but are routinely used by the
defense and civil sectors.

Some steps could be taken to better integrate the large scale and scope of govern-
ment  space  and  space-related  activity.  For  instance,  establishing  prizes  for  innova-
tion  of  use  to  all  three  space  sectors—civil,  commercial,  and  national  security—
makes  sense  provided  all  three  sectors  have  at  least  a  few  desirable  innovations  in
common.  These  requirements  could  range  from  space  transportation  to  space-based
navigation for on-orbit activities that may include autonomous refueling and repair.
They may also include developments in Earth science in mapping and meteorology,
for  which  prizes  could  be  offered  for  new  and  faster  algorithms  to  turn  data  into
actual  information  products  for  the  battlefield  or  the  oil  field  (for  geologic  explo-
ration). These prizes could be jointly funded and developed by the civil and national
security sectors with input from the commercial community.

Another  step,  and  one  that  has  been  taken  in  the  past,  is  establishment  of  a
space-dedicated  cabinet  council.  In  the  past,  such  an  effort  has  been  inadequate  to
overcome  differences  in  goals,  leadership  and  decision-making.  Nor  did  previous
interagency  efforts  adequately  include  provision  for  industry  representation,  which
if optimally designed would include representatives from ‘‘other than the usual sus-
pects’’  by  seeking  participation  of  non-space  companies  (perhaps  WalMart,  Micro-
soft).

SUMMARY OBSERVATIONS

Some of the alternatives outlined in Table 2 address different types of risk (finan-
cial and safety), export issues, and other topics not addressed at length in this testi-
mony.  With  these  omissions  in  mind,  some  general  guidelines  for  public  policy  and
commercial space include:

— Balance financial risk taken by industry compared with asking the public to
underwrite  risk  (for  example,  in  the  case  of  upcoming  deliberations  on  con-
tinuation of commercial launch indemnification)

— Balance  personal  risk  taken  by  crew,  passengers,  and  third  parties  in  com-

mercial space transportation

— Maintain  familiarity  with  the  non-space  commercial  markets  upon  which
commercial  space  relies  (for  example,  computing  hardware,  software,  wire-
less connectivity, telecommunications capacity enhancements and cost reduc-
tions, consumer retail markets)

— Routinely seek out the opinions of non-space industry leaders in information
technology,  telecommunications  technology,  entertainment,  automobiles,
education,  retail  services,  and  other  consumer  markets  to  appreciate  the
larger context in which commercial space operates

— Intervene when necessary and appropriate in legislative and regulatory pol-
icy  in  non-space  commercial  markets  upon  which  commercial  space  relies
(for  instance,  spectrum  and  orbital  access,  environmental  and  occupational
safety/health regulation)

— Balance  export  policy,  national  security  concerns,  and  other  restrictions  on

international trade in space goods and services

— Build  or  build-on  inter-agency  relationships  among  the  myriad  government
offices that are involved directly or indirectly in space technology, policy, and
operations

— Acknowledge that commercial space success depends at least as much if not
more  on  normal  business  challenges  (business  strategy,  customer  relations)
as  on  challenges  that  are  space-unique  or  that  pertain  to  government  com-
mercial space policy

— Accept  that  some  commercial  ventures  will  fail  independently  of  supportive

legislative, regulatory, or other policy

In conclusion, the supportive legacy of U.S. commercial space policy has set a good
precedent  for  the  future.  The  interests  of  the  taxpayer  and  U.S.  industry  are  most
likely to flourish mutually by way of a conservative approach to legislative and reg-
ulatory intervention, coupled with an innovative, incentive-oriented philosophy ame-
nable to demonstration or pathfinder, experimental approaches to policy.

DISCUSSION

COST OF ACCESS TO SPACE

Chairman  CALVERT.  Thank  you.  Thank  you  for  your  testimony.
Mr. Musk, as I was listening to the other testimony, I noticed an
emotional  response  at  one  moment  where  Mr.  Demisch  said  that
we  should  set  policy  on  the  basis  that  no  substantial  launch  cost
reductions will be expected. And I know from discussions with you,
you  hope  to  reduce  those  launch  costs  through  your  business.  So  I
thought I would give you an opportunity to comment on that.

And  since  you  are  one  of  the  newest  entrants  into  the  launch
market,  based  on  your  experience,  how  would  you  characterize  the
U.S.  Government’s  regulation  of  the  launch  industry,  in  general?
And  what  should  the  government  possibly  do  to  enable  this  indus-
try to succeed?

So with that, I will——
Mr.  MUSK.  Certainly.  Well,  I  think  the  fact  that  we  are  offering
the  Falcon  I  launch  vehicle  at  a  price  of  approximately  $6  million,
which,  thanks  to  the  current  U.S.  dollar,  is  quite  a  bargain  on  the
international  market.  We  are  actually—we  only  cost,  effectively,
about three million pounds. The—this compares with the next best
U.S.—or  the  next  best  U.S.  launch  vehicle  being  the  Pegasus  from
Orbital Sciences, which has a NASA list price of about $30 million.

Our vehicle does 50 percent more payload, has a better payload en-
vironment,  has  more  volume.  In  fact,  on  every  meaningful  dimen-
sion, it is superior and yet it is about 1/5 of the cost.

So  I  think  that  is,  you  know—clearly  indicates  that  significant
improvement  is  possible.  We  expect  to  do  the  same  thing  with  our
medium-lift  vehicle,  Falcon  V,  and  we  expect  to  make  some  an-
nouncements  about  a  heavy-lift  vehicle  in  the—later  this  year  and
with  similar  price  reductions  on  the  order  of  four  to  five  over  the
current  U.S.  launch  vehicle  costs.  And  those  we  consider  starting
points. We are going to go down from there.

As far as the—what the U.S. Government can do as—from a reg-
ulatory  standpoint,  you  know,  I  think  there  is  currently  a  fairly
large  body  of  regulation  regarding  expendable  launch.  It  is  quite
onerous. It adds quite a bit to our cost per launch. And I think the
U.S.  Government  should  do  its  best  to  minimize  and  constantly  be
trying to reduce that body of regulation. Regulation just tends to—
it  is  like  atrophy.  It  just  keeps  growing.  Unless  there  is  an  active
force to contain it, it just gets worse and worse every year.

And then to the point that I mentioned in my testimony, I think
we  really  need  to  do  something  about  ITAR.  I  think  that  is  really
harming the U.S. industry.

Chairman CALVERT. Yeah, I am going to give you the opportunity

to answer a question.

There  are  people,  and  you  have  probably  heard  this,  Mr.  Musk,
because  of  your  own  considerable  personal  wealth,  I  heard  the
phraseology ‘‘angel.’’ You are probably considered one of those folks,
and  that—you  know,  you  have  more  capability  financially  than
most  to  do  this  that—are  you  in  this  for  the  business,  or  are  you
in  this—because,  you  know,  I  am  sure  you  heard  this  behind  your
back, are you in this for a hobby? So I want you to have the oppor-
tunity to answer this question for the record, because——

Mr. MUSK. Certainly.
Chairman CALVERT.—I think you should—you deserve that.
Mr. MUSK. I certainly—well, if it is a hobby, it is the most expen-
sive  hobby  I  could  possibly  conceive  of.  You  know,  in  fact,  the—I
have—there  is  a  joke  in  the  space  industry,  which  is  how  do  you
make  a  small  fortune  in  the  launch  business,  if  you  start  with  a
large one? And I have heard that joke so many times that I started
to—just  for  amusement,  when  people  ask  me  why  I  started  the
company, I would say, ‘‘Well, you know, I had a large fortune, and
I  was  trying  to  make  it  small  very  quickly,  and  this  seemed  like
a good way to do it.’’

But  the  serious  answer  is  that  this  really  is  a  business,  which
I expect to be really quite profitable. I think we could hit a positive
cash  flow  as  soon  as  the—late  this  year  or  early  next  year,  which
would mean that, if we were able to do so, we would have achieved
positive  cash  flow  in  our  third  or  fourth  year  of  operation,  which
is  unusually  good  for  any  business,  and  I  would  say  particularly
good for the launch business.

So I think I am really quite convinced that there is a solid busi-
ness  there.  You  know,  we  are  doing  our  best  to  solicit  business
throughout  the  world.  You  know,  we—the  Malaysian  launch,  we
competed  against  the  Russians  for  that  and  won.  You  know,  that
was  a  tough  one.  We  have  got  a  couple  of  other  international

launches  we  expect  to  win.  We  are  working  hard  to  earn  NASA
business.  So  I  am—we  are  trying  to  get  as  much  business  as  pos-
sible in order to drive that cost even lower than it is today.

Chairman CALVERT. Thank you.
Mr. Rohrabacher.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  One  thousand  dollars  a  pound  on  Saturn  V?

Is that in today’s dollars or then-dollars?

Mr. DEMISCH. Then-year dollars.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Then-dollars? So it is——
Mr. DEMISCH. So adjustment for inflation, it is about $10,000.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. So it is about the same, then?
Mr.  DEMISCH.  Yeah,  it  hasn’t—things  haven’t  changed  much.  I
think if Mr. Musk can achieve the kind of overhead reductions that
I  think  are  necessary  to  get  the  costs  down  to  something  which  is
a little bit closer to materials and engineering content, it would be
a  tremendous  gain.  It  hasn’t  been  possible  for  any  of  the  other
players, maybe perhaps because of regulatory issues, but——

Mr. MUSK. If I—this is an interesting point, which I suspect that

members may not be aware of.

Do you know what the cost of propellant is on our rocket? Propel-
lant  is  usually  the  dominating  cost.  It—you  know,  gas—jet  fuel  is
the dominating cost in airliners. The cost of propellant for our rock-
et  is  $50,000  a  launch.  That  shows  you  there  is  a  huge  amount  of
room  for  improvement.  And  we  should  be  getting  to  the  point
where that cost actually matters as opposed to being an accounting
error on the launchcrafts.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, of course—Mr. Musk, how old are your

children now?

Mr. MUSK. They are one.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. I am—you have two babies that are one, and
I have three babies that are one week from being one. Now do you
foresee our babies being able to go to college on the Moon?

Mr. MUSK. Well, I think college on the moon may be challenging,
but  if  they  can  actually  have  the  potential  to  go  there  at  all,  that
is  really  part  of  what  I  am  working  hard  to  try  to  achieve  is  that
there should be the possibility that, you know—that any citizen can
go  to  space,  go  beyond  orbit,  even  to  the  Moon  and  going  to  Mars.
I  think  it  would  be  really  a  very  dismal  future  where  that  possi-
bility was closed.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. I noticed when the other panelists were talk-
ing,  there  was  a  lot  of—I  am  sorry.  You  did  sound  a  little  pessi-
mistic,  sir,  but—about  the  development  of  technology  and  over-
coming  this,  but  I  think  that  what  we  hear  from  Mr.  Rutan  and
Mr.  Musk,  who  are  on  the  business  end  of  this,  is  that  the  tech-
nology  development  will  be  there.  They  are  confident.  I  mean,  I
noted  confidence  in  both  Mr.  Rutan  and  Mr.  Whitehorn  in  terms
of  technology.  What  they  don’t  seem  to  be  confident  in  is  govern-
ment  policy  that  will  permit  them  the  type  of  technology  develop-
ment to overcome problems.

Mr. DEMISCH. I think that I will defer to Mr. Musk in one nano-
second,  but  the  challenge  really  has  been  that  there  are—we  are
living with the same technology in space propulsion and have, real-
ly, since—probably the Shuttle is the most advanced engine of any
space vehicle currently flying. And so that sets your underlying en-

gineering  merit.  And  then  the  question  is  how  cheaply  can  you
build  it.  And  that  then  becomes  a  question  of  how  costly  and  com-
plicated is it and what is your overhead weights on your people and
all of the rest of these things.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  You  know,  I  think  every  time  that  human-
kind  has  said  that,  they  have  been  wrong.  And  let  me  just  note,
and  Mr.  Rutan  is  not  on  the  stand  now,  but  I  will  never  forget
when  he  talked  about  when  he—I  had  a  group  of  people  there  to
hear  a  lecture  by  him  in  my  District,  when  he  talked  about  how
he  has  changed  the  way  that  there  is  re-entry  and  how  that  the
implications on that—of that. I mean, this is not just a mechanical
change. It is actually a change of concept.

Mr.  DEMISCH.  I  think  Mr.  Rutan  is  a  genius  in  aviation.  I  think
that that is—I bless his efforts, and I hope that this committee can
encourage  NASA  to  give  people  like  him  a  lot  more  space  in  the
aeronautics arena, because it—God knows it needs it, where indus-
try  would  just  be  fading  before  our  very  eyes  in  terms  of  employ-
ment  and  so  on.  It  would  be  nice  if  we  had  people  like  Mr.  Musk
in  the  space  frontier.  All  I  am  saying  is  the  underlying  technical
merit of the boosters hasn’t changed. The only real way for drastic
improvement  is  something  completely  different,  like  an  elevator.
That  I  think  is  technically  doable  over  time.  So  it  is  not  there  yet,
but at least it is conceptual.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  that  is—there  is  a  revolutionary  idea:
the  elevator  into  space.  But  let  me  know.  I  never  looked  at  that.

Thank you.
Mr.  Chairman,  if  you  would  just  indulge  me  one  more  note,  and
that  is  that  what  we  have  heard  today  is  that  there  are  some
things  we  can  do,  and  the—Mr.  Musk  has  made  it  very  clear  that
export  control  is—as  our  witness  of  the  first  panel  mentioned  ex-
port  control,  I—and  we  are  talking  about  people  who  understand
the  importance  of  freedom  here  and  are  not  suggesting  that  we  do
anything  that  puts  our  country  in  jeopardy  by  making  these  tech-
nologies  available  to  potential  enemies.  But  I  think  it  behooves  us
and  the  Subcommittee  to  become  a  force,  as  I  have  tried  to  be,  in
the  international  relationships  to  try  to  push  these  barriers  aside
for countries that are friendly to the United States and pose no fu-
ture danger to us. And it is something that we could do that would
really help these folks out. This is one of the regulations——

Chairman  CALVERT.  And  I  would  be  happy  to  work  with  you  on
this.  I  am  on  the  Armed  Services  Committee,  and  you  are  on  the
International Relations Committee. We—and this committee. We—
between  that,  we  ought  to  be  able  to  work  out  some  streamlining
to make this process work a little more simpler.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. And one on—other note is that Mr. Musk did,
I  would  like  to  note,  mention  the  concept  of  prizes  as  a  means  of
developing new technologies. And I have a bill for that, and I would
hope  our  new  head  of  NASA,  who  we  are  all  mystic  about,  he  also
takes a positive view towards that approach, and perhaps we could
work  something  out,  and  move  in  that  area  as  well  in  developing
new technologies by prizes for them rather than having the govern-
ment bureaucracy telling people how to turn the screws and seeing
the actual development process.

So thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

EMERGING SPACE-BASED MARKETS

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
I am going to have a question for all of the panelists.
And looking into the future, do you see evidence of newly emerg-
ing  markets  or  products  that  will  rely  on  space-based  assets?  And
if  so,  what  might  they  be?  And  we  will  put  it  another  way.  Are
there products or services coming into the marketplace in the next
five  to  10  years  that  are  likely  to  spur  the  additional  space-based
infrastructure?

And  I  think  I  will  start  with  you,  Mr.  Musk,  and  just  head  on

down the panel.

Mr. MUSK. Sure. I think that there are a couple trends that I see.
One is in the small satellite arena of doing things with the smaller,
lower-cost  satellites  rather  than  with  gigantic,  very  expensive  sat-
ellites.  I  think  we  are  seeing  that  trend.  We  are  certainly  seeing
that  trend  and  the  interest  in  our  small  launch  vehicle.  I  think  as
the—as time goes by, there is greater and greater interest in more
broadcast,  more  communications,  more  exploration.  I  see  a—really
a very positive future for space. And it is—for those that are pessi-
mistic,  I  think  it  is—bearing  in  mind  that  space  is  a  very  cyclic
business, and so when—and once—people are prone to become very
optimistic at the top of the cycle and very pessimistic at the bottom
of the cycle. And you need to remember that it is a cyclic business.

Chairman CALVERT. It sounds like real estate.
Mr. MUSK. Yeah. Buy low, sell high.
Chairman CALVERT. Mr. Vinter.
Mr. VINTER. Yes, sir.
I  echo  what  Elon  is  saying  about  small  satellites  replacing  big
satellites.  The  big  satellites  have  proved  to  be  very,  very  difficult
to  produce,  taking  three  and  four  years  to  get  out  of  the  factory,
whereas  the  smaller  ones  could  come  out  in  a  year  or  a  year  and
a half. So that is definitely a trend.

There  is  also,  I  think,  going  to  be  a  big  interest  in  so-called  KA
band,  and  this  is  an  application  where  there  is  interaction,  you
know, back and forth over the Internet. And we are seeing a num-
ber  of  people  today  who  are  really  interested  in  KA  band.  And
there  are  a  couple  of  experimental  packages  that—and  one  oper-
ational package already flying with us. And I think that if it takes
off, it will be—probably very interesting.

Mr. DEMISCH. I think that there is still a tremendous opportunity
for  growth,  or  just  start  off  with  trying  to  use  your  cell  phone.  I
mean, the service is still terrible any way you slice it, and so there
is  need  for  a  better  service,  and  the  only  way  you  really  get  it  is
to have it coming down from above rather than from the buildings
on  the  side.  And  the  other  thing  is,  of  course,  I  think  the  kind  of
really  high-speed  mobile  links,  as  you  sort  of  start  to  see  TV  on
your cell phone and so on, again, the best place to do it is from up
above. I think the underlying concept that was behind Teledesic re-
mains  sound,  and  I  don’t  know  that  their  business  plan  is  close  to
being  resurrected,  but  a  lot  of  work  has  been  done  there.  And  I
think  that  that  is  going  to  see  a  lot  more  future.  And  the  other
thing is I just think that the combination of surveillance and track-

ing  for  monitoring  and  national  security  purposes  is,  in  fact,  going
to  be  a  large  growth  market  over  the  course  of  the  coming  decade.
Dr.  MACAULEY.  I  come  from  a  research  organization  where  my
colleagues specialize in agriculture, energy, water, and I argue with
them,  and  they  are  gradually  coming  to  agree,  that  I  think  that
space  is  every  bit  as  an  important  and  natural  resource  as  those.
And  it  is  a  natural  resource  that  is  really  unique.  It  is  an  incred-
ibly  unique  environment.  It  has  fundamental  attributes  that  make
it a very difficult place to be for a long period of time, but nonethe-
less  it  is  a  resource  that  we  are  still  learning  a  lot  about.  And  I
remember  eight  years  ago  when  we  would  get  USA  Today  or  the
Wall  Street  Journal,  right  under  the  headline,  it  said,  ‘‘via  sat-
ellite,’’  which  meant  in  order  to  get  these  newspapers  to  remote
places  around  the  world  in  time  for  people’s  morning  coffee,  the
text  of  the  newspapers  was  sent  via  satellite  to  regional  printing
presses.  And  now  we  don’t  see  that  underneath  the  Wall  Street
Journal or USA Today. They are still using that technology, but it
is  embedded  so  much  in  our  way  of  life,  and  similarly  with  much
of  our  communications  activities.  So  space,  as  a  place  through
which to bounce signals, is very much a part of our life. Will it ever
be  a  place  where  we  turn  to  the  dreams  of  a  decade  ago  of  doing
materials  processing?  I  remember  hearing,  similar  to  those  today,
where  we  had  entrepreneurs  thinking  about  space  as  a  unique  en-
vironment  in  which  to  do  some  very  interesting  materials  proc-
essing.  And  then  what  happened  was  when  3M  and  other  compa-
nies  stepped  up  to  the  plate  to  try  it  out,  it  took  so  long  to  get
there,  to  get  through  the  process  of  getting  your  assets  into  space
and getting the experiments done that we had accomplished the in-
novation here on Earth much more quickly.

So once we get to space more quickly and can stay there for sus-
tained periods of time routinely, we may see some of those visions,
which were very visionary, recycle back. And then today, the exten-
sive discussion about not just a place through which to bounce sig-
nals  but  a  place  to  actually  send  us  all  and,  perhaps,  someday  to
live,  if  not  visit.  I  think  that—yeah,  I  think  the  future  of  space  is
very bright, subject to a lot of other things that have to happen in
a business sense to make it work and subject to sound government
role.

Chairman CALVERT. Well, thank you.
And  I  want  to  thank  this  panel.  We  are  living  in  an  exciting
time,  and  I  am  looking  forward  to  working  with  all  of  you  in  the
future.  And  I  am  looking  forward  to,  Elon,  coming  out  to  your
launch here shortly, and I wish you all of the success in the world.
And  I,  again,  thank  this  panel  for  coming  today.  We  are  ad-

journed.

[Whereupon, at 11:45 a.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. As you understand it, what steps will you have to go through to get the commer-
cial  version  of  your  spaceship  approved  for  commercial  service  by  the  FAA?
Which office of the FAA will you be coordinating with?

A1. In my opening remarks I did outline what I believe the proper steps for govern-
ment  approval  of  commercial  spaceships.  My  handout  also  included  more  detail  on
the subject and is attached for your reference. (See Attachment)
Q2. In  your  testimony  you  indicated  that  you  have  a  number  of  proposed  changes
to  the  licensing  process  that  you  think  would  make  sense.  Please  provide  your
proposed changes for the record.

A2. Our  main  emphasis  is  that  FAA  needs  to  staff  the  regulatory  office  with  per-
sonnel  experienced  in  the  research  testing  and  certification  of  commercial  aircraft.
These personnel are found at AVS, not at AST.

Questions submitted by Representative Sheila Jackson Lee
Q1. Some of those who have argued for an ‘‘informed consent’’ approach to safety for
the  emerging  Personal  Space  Flight  industry  make  an  analogy  to  the  ‘‘barn-
storming’’ days of aviation when a formal structure for regulating safety did not
yet exist but the aviation market continued to grow dramatically. It doesn’t seem
from your testimony that you agree with that analogy. Is that true? If you don’t
agree, why not?

A1. We  are  not  among  those  who  have  argued  that  informed  consent  is  adequate.
Two  things  need  to  happen  for  a  healthy,  sustainable  private  space  flight  industry.

1. A level of safety at least as good as the early airliners.
2. Some form of FAA approval for the flight vehicle’s safety as regards the pay-

ing passengers, not just the uninvolved public.

We  believe  the  industry  might  be  stillborn  after  the  first  fatal  accident  if  these

two items are not provided.

Questions submitted by Representative Jim Costa
Q1. One  of  the  goals  of  previous  hypersonic  R&D  programs  such  as  the  National
Aerospace Plane was to cut travel times between widely separated locations such
as  the  west  coast  of  the  United  States  and  Asia.  Would  a  commercial  version
of  the  sub-orbital  spaceship  you  have  developed  be  able  to  contribute  to  that
goal? Why or why not?

A1. Sub-orbital  rockets,  flying  parabolic  missions  will  work  nicely  for  flying  people
outside  the  atmosphere.  However,  they  are  limited  to  300  or  400-mile  trips.  Air
breathing, high altitude propulsion or space planes that skip along the atmosphere’s
extremities would be needed for travel between widely separated locations.

REGULATION OF MANNED SUB-ORBITAL SPACE SYSTEMS

FOR RESEARCH AND COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS

A summary prepared by Burt Rutan, Scaled Composites

Safety Requirements for the Private Spaceline Industry

• New generic solutions for safety as compared to historic Government manned

space operations will be mandatory

• Cannot run a Spaceline without a huge reduction of current risk

Safety Goals: Airline experience as a model

• Risk statistics, fatal risk per flight

• First 44 years of manned space flight = one per 62 flights
• First airliners (1927 & 1928) = one per 5,500 flights
• Early airliners (1934 to 1936) = one per 31,000 flights
• Current airliners = one per two to five million flights
• Modern military fighters = one mishap per 33,000 flights

• Logical goal:

• Better than the first airliners
• < one percent of the historic government space flight risk

Different Systems Need Different Regulation Methods

• The AST Process

• To  show  that  the  consequence  of  failure,  i.e.,  the  expectation  of  casualty
• Deals with systems that are historically dangerous.

(Ec) for the non-involved public (NIP) is low.

• The AVR (now AVS) Process

• To show that the probability of failure (Pf) is low.
• Assures safety of crew and passengers.
• Deals with systems that need to be reliable.

• The risk method approach by AST

area.

• Risk is product of failure probability and consequence.
• NIP  risk  with  dangerous  systems  is  assured  only  by  selection  of  flight
• Flight  crew  risk  with  dangerous  systems  can  be  addressed  only  by  flight
• However,  since  Pf  cannot  be  calculated  for  immature  systems,  AST  has
no  acceptable  process  for  new  systems  that  have  to  be  safe  enough  for
commercial passenger service.

termination staging.

• AST Methods for Booster-like systems

• Computer-flown or remote operation
• Automation that requires backup via flight-termination systems
• Ground-launched
• Safety-critical rocket propulsion
• Un-piloted stages dropped
• High-scatter landing

• AVR Methods for Aircraft-like systems

• Human Piloted flight
• Expendable-like flight-termination systems are not appropriate
• Runway takeoff
• Rocket propulsion not safety critical

74

• No ‘‘bombing’’ of hardware that presents risk to NIP
• Horizontal aircraft-like runway recovery

by AST.

• If  the  safety  approach  is  based  on  failure  consequence  it  should  be  regulated

• If  the  safety  approach  is  based  on  failure  probability  it  should  be  regulated

by AVR or by staff experienced in aircraft safety assurance.

• If  safety  is  based  on  both  consequence  and  vehicle  reliability,  then  con-
sequence should be calculated by AST, but Pf must be accessed by those with
aircraft safety regulation experience.

Experimental Research Testing of Airplane-like Systems

• Cannot  be  addressed  by  enforcing  standards  or  guidelines—the  important
need  is  to  allow  innovation;  to  seek  safety  breakthroughs  without  regulatory
hurdles. Regulators must not be expected to appreciate this need during a re-
search test environment.

• Pf  cannot  be  calculated,  thus  historic  data  must  be  a  guide  for  approval  of

an adequate test area to meet Ec intent for NIP.

• Environmental requirements, like for aircraft are not needed, but they can be

tolerated, with costs not the full burden of the developer.

• The AVR waiver method for all regulations is mandatory. The developer must
be  able  to  argue  the  equivalent  safety  justification  for  non-compliance  to  any
regulation.  This  is  critical,  especially  for  an  immature  industry  with  indeter-
minate technical issues.

• The  AST  launch  licensing  process  is  not  acceptable  due  to  its  costs,  its  hin-
drance  of  innovation  and  its  negative  effect  on  safety  policy.  The  AVR-EAC
(Experimental  Airworthiness  Certificate)  method  works  and  must  be  imple-
mented.  The  system  is  based  on  respect  for  a  developer’s  safety  record  and
the expectation that he will follow the license rules.

senger Operations

• The  manufacturer  and  the  operator  cannot  accept  a  scenario  in  which  the
FAA has no role in approving the safety of crews or passengers. His responsi-
bility to do adequate testing to assure passenger safety must have acceptance
by the FAA. Otherwise he has no unbiased defense at trial following an acci-
dent.

• Part  23  &  25  Certification  are  based  on  defining  conformity.  Then,  by  test
and  analysis  showing  adequate  margins  for  the  conformed  vehicle.  Subse-
quently  the  holder  of  the  certificate  can  then  produce  and  operate  unlimited
numbers  of  vehicles  that  conform.  The  main  costs  of  certification  are  the
issues related to conformity, not the specific tests to show margins.

• Any ethical manufacturer or operator must test to show margins, even in the

absence of any government regulation.

• However, initially the manufacturer and operator will build and operate only
a very small number of vehicles, thus making the detailed conformity process
debilitating.  Also,  the  intensity  of  the  process  would  interfere  with  the  need
to  solve  new  technical  problems  and  to  maintain  a  ‘‘question,  never  defend’’
posture while system technical status is not mature.

• Our proposal: an applicant seeking approval to fly passengers will be required
to define the tests needed to show adequate margins for his design and define
the  required  systems  safety  analysis.  He  must  then  obtain  acceptance  of  the
test plan by FAA regulators and later get acceptance that the tests were sat-
isfactorily completed. The process will be design specific and repeated for each
flight article.

• Conformity of the design, the tools, the systems or the manufacturing process

will not be required.

• A  manufacturer  can  select  the  conformity  process  as  an  option  if  he  desires

to avoid the individual tests of each production article.

• Conformity may be mandatory after the industry matures (the aircraft certifi-

cation process).

Lessons  from  the  Regulatory  Process  During  the  SpaceShipOne  (SS1)  Re-

search Flight Tests

75

• The  Tier1  test  program  involved  88  flights,  17  for  the  SS1  and  71  for  the
White Knight. 83 of those flights were licensed via an AVR–AIR–200 Experi-
mental Airworthiness Certificate. Those flights were done under the authority
of the EAC and directed via the information in its Operating Limitations list.
The EAC was in effect for the duration of the program, July 2002 to October
2004.

• Five  flights  of  SS1  were  flown  under  the  additional  authority  of  an  AST

Launch License. License was in effect from March 2004 to October 2004.

• The 83 flights flown under the EAC involved the highest risk, both to the pi-
lots  and  the  NIP:  first  flights  of  unproven  vehicles  and  nearly  all  envelope
expansion, including first supersonic flight of SS1 to max-q.

• The  EAC  flights  were  regulated  similar  to  the  1,800  research  flights  con-
ducted by Scaled on 36 aircraft types over a 30-year period: we were expected
to  fly  within  the  Ops  Limits  list,  and  were  trusted  to  do  so.  The  program  al-
lowed  the  innovation  always  present  in  aircraft  research,  and  did  not  inter-
fere with our ‘question, never defend’ safety policy.

• Development  of  the  new  safety  innovations  were  done  under  the  EAC:  the
new  type  hybrid  rocket  motor,  the  air  launch  and  the  ‘care-free  re-entry’
feathered concept.

• The  EAC  process  provided  an  efficient  environment  for  exploratory  testing

and continued the historic research aircraft record of safety for the NIP.

• The AST Launch License process enforced on the remaining five flights of SS1
was  a  very  different  regulatory  environment.  We  were  assured  streamlining
from  the  certifications  needed  for  commercial  operations  approvals  but  were
kept  in  the  dark  on  specifics.  The  process  involved  a  15  month,  three  party
Ec  analysis  that  failed  to  arrive  at  an  adequate  calculation  for  Pf,  thus  ren-
dering the Ec determination to be useless. The process was misguided and in-
appropriate, at times resembling a type certification effort and left the appli-
cant without the basic information needed to determine status. The regulators
requested Ec analysis, then ignored those results without informing the appli-
cant  or  allowing  him  to  defend,  to  revise  or  to  resubmit  the  data.  The  regu-
lators  refused  to  reveal  the  government’s  analysis  method  for  Ec  calculation.
The ‘shell game’ continued for the majority of the program, resulting in a se-
vere  distraction  to  key  test  personnel  as  well  as  high  costs  and  a  disregard
for our safety policy. The environment also precluded innovation.

• The  Launch  License  process,  as  applied  to  the  aircraft  research  test  environ-
ment resulted in increased risk for our flight crews, the very people that bear
the true risk in experimental flight tests.

• The AST office had no waiver policy, and answered our requests by a written
denial  from  the  Administrator  without  giving  the  applicant  the  opportunity
to  debate  or  negotiate  the  technical  merits  or  to  get  an  opinion  from  the
EAC’s regulatory staff.

Conclusions

• An  applicant  for  approval  to  fly  research  flight  tests  of  piloted,  aircraft-like
systems  must  have  a  defined  process,  one  that  allows  him  to  plan  his  pro-
gram  staffing  and  financial  needs.  It  is  not  acceptable  to  impose  undefined,
inappropriate  forced  oversight.  The  specific  EAC  process  has  served  the  in-
dustry well for decades and should be used and enforced by regulators famil-
iar with research aircraft testing.
• The  Ec  process,  developed  for  protection  of  population  from  the  dangers  of
ground-launched,  expendable  rocket  boosters,  is  not  workable  for  application
to  piloted,  aircraft-like  systems  during  research  tests  and  must  be  replaced
by  the  AVR  method  of  having  test-experienced  regulators  select  an  appro-
priate  flight  test  area  for  research  tests.  The  Ec  process  might  be  justifiable
for commercial operations, but it must be regulated by those experienced with
commercial aircraft operations.
• Regarding  licenses  to  conduct  commercial  flights  that  carry  revenue  pas-
sengers,  it  is  not  acceptable  for  FAA  to  ignore  the  approval  or  acceptance  of
the  vehicle’s  ability  to  safely  fly  people.  Regulation  must  be  done  by  experi-
enced (aircraft experienced) staff.

• The acceptance of the system’s probable safety can be done via a vehicle-spe-
cific  test  requirement  process  for  structures  and  safety  analysis  for  systems,
rather  than  the  more  expensive  Type  Certification  process  that  includes  full
conformity assurance. These processes cannot be defined in advance by speci-
fication  of  standards  or  by  design  guidelines,  since  every  new  system  will
have unique features. The testing details and systems safety analysis process
must  be  specific  to  the  vehicle  and  its  intended  operation.  This  process  does
not  have  to  be  significantly  more  expensive  than  that  which  would  be  done
by any ethical manufacturer in the absence of government regulation.

Questions submitted by Representative Sheila Jackson Lee
Q1. It  has  long  been  my  belief  and  contention  that  space  exploration  is  something
that  should  not  be  limited.  This  principle  has  generally  applied  to  space  explo-
ration by nations, but today we face the prospect of space tourism where individ-
uals  would  be  the  ones  who  get  to  explore  space.  I  feel  strongly  that  this  oppor-
tunity  should  not  just  go  to  the  rich,  but  also  to  others  who  have  a  passion  for
space exploration; especially students should at least have a chance at this. I be-
lieve  in  the  long  run  this  will  be  good  for  business  and  good  for  the  science  of
space  exploration  because  it  will  only  increase  the  general  public’s  interest  in
space.  Does  Virgin  Galactic  have  any  plans  to  provide  the  chance  to  explore
space  to  even  a  select  few  individuals  who  may  not  have  the  means  to  pay  for
such a flight?

A1. Representative Jackson Lee, let me assure you that Virgin Galactic shares your
concern  that  financial  barriers  alone  should  not  limit  commercial  space  travel  to
only  the  most  financially  able.  Virgin  Galactic  is  committed  to  making  seats  avail-
able  on  our  spacecraft  each  year  for  individuals  who  cannot  afford  to  pay  the  com-
mercial  price  for  this  adventure  of  a  lifetime.  Our  plans  to  accomplish  this  shared
goal are in the early stages. I will provide more details to you and the Subcommittee
as they crystallize. At this point, we are in discussions with the National Space So-
ciety  to  receive  its  input.  Internally,  we  also  are  exploring  opportunities  to  make
tickets  available  every  year  for  other  charitable  purposes.  As  our  plans  solidify,  we
will keep you and the Subcommittee advised.
Q2. You come from a background in the airline industry. As you look forward to op-
erating  commercial  passenger-carrying  spaceships,  what  aspects  of  your  oper-
ations  do  you  think  will  be  similar  to  those  of  airlines,  and  what  will  be  dif-
ferent?  In  particular,  how  will  the  safety  and  maintenance  practices  you  plan
to follow in your Virgin Galactic operation differ from those you follow in Virgin
Atlantic?

A2. Lest there be any confusion, commercial operations for Virgin Galactic and Vir-
gin  Atlantic  will  differ  markedly  in  many  significant  respects.  Running  a  commer-
cial  space  business  is  dramatically  different  than  running  a  scheduled  commercial
airline.  Differences  aside,  the  most  important  common  thread  Virgin  Galactic  and
Virgin Atlantic share is Virgin’s unwavering commitment to safety. With respect to
the airlines Virgin operates around the world and the passenger rail service we op-
erate in the United Kingdom, the Virgin brand has become synonymous with safety.
We  have  never  lost  a  passenger.  This  fact  is  our  proudest  accomplishment.  Simi-
larly, safety will be Virgin Galactic’s North Star.

Virgin  Galactic  will  differ  from  Virgin  Atlantic  in  a  number  of  significant  oper-
ational  respects.  For  instance,  it  will  not  operate  point-to-point  service  and  it  will
not be subject to the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) customary regulatory
structure for commercial carriers. These differences aside, the safety procedures we
envision  will  bear  some  similarities  to  the  lessons  we  have  learned  from  our  safe
and  successful  airline  ventures.  For  example,  Virgin  Galactic’s  pilots  will  be  ex-
pected to develop a pre-flight safety check protocol similar to that used by our com-
mercial airline pilots. Similarly, we intend to have maintenance practices and space-
craft check procedures similar to those jointly used by operators and manufacturers
in  the  commercial  airline  industry.  One  key  area  of  difference  will  be  Virgin
Galactic’s  pre-flight  focus  on  the  health,  safety  and  security  of  our  passengers.
Working closely with the FAA’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation, we plan
to develop pre-flight guidelines that will be rigorously followed.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. In  the  past,  we  have  heard  the  concern  expressed  that  new  commercial  space
ventures would not be able to find insurance because of the risk presented to in-
surers from potential launch failures. Is that still a concern?

A1. Underwriters  are  not  unduly  concerned  about  launch  failures.  They  recognize
that launch failures are part of the unique circumstances with respect to space ven-
tures.  What  underwriters  are  concerned  about  is  untried  and  unproven  technology.
Underwriters  generally  are  quite  willing  to  insure  developed  technology.  Thus,  in
most cases, underwriters wait to see one or two successful launches before commit-
ting  underwriting  capacity  for  subsequent  launches.  The  thesis  being  that  a  new
launch  vehicle  or  other  untried  technology  should  first  be  proven  to  work  before
seeking  insurance.  That  said,  occasionally  the  market  will  sometimes  insure  new
technology but at a very much higher price.
Q2. How  will  the  insurance  market  for  commercial  passenger-carrying  spaceships
differ from that for expendable launch vehicles that launch unmanned satellites?
A2. The  market  will  consider  the  reliability  for  commercial  passenger-carrying
spaceships  in  much  the  same  way  that  it  does  for  expendable  launch  vehicles  that
launch  unmanned  satellites.  The  space  market  is  primarily  a  property  market.  It
will rate each spaceship and/or launch vehicle on its own merits. Thus, today wheth-
er  we  are  discussing  Space  Shuttles,  the  Atlas  or  the  Delta,  the  market  will  rate
the  launch  system  on  its  own  merits.  In  due  course  as  passenger-carrying  space-
ships  prove  themselves  to  be  working,  the  likelihood  is  that  eventually  passenger-
carrying  spaceships  will  be  treated  very  much  like  airline  planes  and  their  pas-
sengers are treated today.
Q3. As  you  look  at  the  emerging  commercial  human  space  flight  industry  being  de-
scribed  by  Mr.  Rutan  and  Mr.  Whitehorn,  how  important  will  demonstrating
adequate  safety  margins  in  advance  of  flight  operations  be  if  they  want  to  get
insurance?  Are  there  any  regulatory  approaches  to  safety  that  would  be  more
likely to make it easier to get insurance? Less likely?

A3. As stated in the answer to Question 1 above, the market would want to see suc-
cessful  demonstration  of  the  vehicles  carrying  humans  before  making  significant
commitment to such vehicles. I should point out from the beginning that the market
has insured humans on the Space Shuttle and indeed tourists on the Russian Soyez
vehicle. A regulatory regime much like the FAA regime for aviation will most likely
be  rewarded  by  the  market  and  the  demonstration  of  successful  flights  will  be  the
determining factor in these circumstances.
Q4. In  your  testimony  you  mentioned  the  potential  impact  of  current  export  control

policies on the U.S. commercial space industry.
• Please elaborate on the nature of your concern with the present situation.
• What would you do to fix the problem?

A4. The concern with the current ITAR arrangement is that non-U.S. satellite oper-
ators  are  favoring  European  suppliers  of  the  satellites  over  U.S.  suppliers  in  large
measure because of the complication of the ITAR regime. The current ITAR regime
limits  the  amount  of  information  available  to  non-U.S.  owners.  Thus,  all  other  fac-
tors  being  equal,  a  non-U.S.  customer  will  buy  a  European  satellite  because  it  is
much simpler to buy such satellite. I am aware of a number of instances where this
happens to be true.

Please  note  I  am  talking  of  standard  commercial  communication  satellites.  With
respect to launch vehicles and Earth observation satellites and new high technology
equipment, I do not suggest any change to the current regime. In particular, launch
vehicles  and  Earth  observation  satellites  can  be  deemed  weapons  and  as  such,
should be controlled to the maximum extent possible. With respect to standard com-
munication satellites, however, I should point out that such satellites are in produc-
tion  in  Europe  without  restrictions  and  nothing  is  gained  from  strictly  controlling
technical information with respect thereto.

With  respect  to  these  satellites,  consideration  should  be  given  to  removing  such
satellites  from  the  Munitions  List.  If  there  is  a  particular  technology,  by  all  means
this  technology  should  be  protected.  If  the  concern  is  of  a  particular  country  such

as China, then it should be specified as such. The above comments are made as an
observer of the current situation and it does not have an insurance connotation.

With respect to the non-U.S. underwriter community (approximately  o of the mar-
ket is overseas), I suggest an annual license be adopted for each underwriter for all
projects.  A  license  is  now  issued  to  each  underwriter  for  each  launch  to  be  insured
or each satellite on-orbit, no matter how similar the satellites are. While the current
government  employees  are  very  efficient  in  processing  licenses,  it  seems  a  waste  of
time. A streamlined approach would be simpler.

Q1. The  Federal  Government  invests  large  sums  of  money  in  space  and  aeronautics
research  and  development.  From  an  economic  perspective  which  has  a  greater
return  on  investment  for  the  U.S.  economy,  investments  in  space  or  investments
in  aeronautics?  Are  there  specific  areas  within  either  space  or  aeronautics  that
have a particularly high return on investment?

A1. The  economic  contribution  of  the  aeronautics  sector  substantially  exceeds  that
of the space segment, both in terms of direct sales as well as when factoring in the
associated  business  activity.  Moreover,  because  a  substantial  fraction  of  the  federal
space  funding  is  committed  to  support  manned  space  operations,  an  investment
whose  goals  are  primarily  social  rather  than  economic,  the  returns  on  space  spend-
ing  are  further  diluted.  Historically,  the  Congress  has  not  wavered  in  its  steadfast
support  of  advanced  technology  development,  with  aerospace  a  leading  beneficiary.
Experience  has  shown  that  advanced  technology  brings  enormous  social  benefit
through  the  new  industries  and  jobs  that  it  makes  possible.  Hence  at  the  national
level  it  has  been  the  Congress’s  choice  to  support  ambitious  new  technology  and
leave  marginal  improvements  to  industry.  To  achieve  a  better  return  on  its  aero-
space  investment,  the  Congress  may  find  it  useful  to  take  a  wider  perspective  on
the  challenges  facing  the  aeronautics  and  space  communities.  In  civil  aeronautics,
the aerodynamics and structures technology is mature.

One  limiting  factor  is  the  need  for  manual  control  of  each  individual  flight.  This
is  both  economically  burdensome,  (crew  costs,  along  with  fuel  and  capital,  are  one
of  the  three  largest  elements  in  the  air  carriers  direct  operating  cost)  and  a  safety/
reliability issue, particularly in general aviation. A more aggressive push to achieve
automatic  fight,  with  increased  safety  standards  from  what  we  now  accept,  should
be  a  national  goal  Deployment  would  presumably  start  with  the  cargo  carriers,  but
should spread very quickly as it would transform airline economics and greatly im-
prove  the  utility  of  general  aviation.  Achieving  this  capability  requires  at  the  very
least seamless cooperation between the FAA and NASA, plus superior software inte-
gration, but the payoff is very large.

Feasibility is clearly demonstrated by the growing numbers of military UAVs now

routinely deployed in the U.S. and abroad.

In  the  military  aerospace  segment,  strategists  are  seeking  much  higher  speed
flight  vehicles  and  very  long  endurance  systems.  Much  better  materials  and  more
efficient  power  sources  are  prerequisites  for  these  efforts.  unfortunately,  although
NASA has much experience in these issues, the NASA effort in these areas is small
and shrinking. The success of the X–43 program last year is not being pursued, even
though  the  return  on  investment  from  operational  hypersonics  for  the  country  ap-
pears compelling.

The  returns  on  space  investments  are  often  smaller  simply  because  of  time.  The
most  promising  commercial  space  businesses  are  communications  and  Earth  obser-
vation  both  substantially  regulated  and  hence  subject  to  long  delays  before  new
technology  can  be  brought  to  market.  For  instance,  the  Ka  band  communications
now beginning to be offered were demonstrated in the 70s by NASA’s experimental
and  very  successful  ATS  III  satellite.  To  rebuild  the  Nation’s  technology  reserves
and  to  restore  NASA  to  its  proper  role  as  a  technology  generator  for  the  national
economy, in my opinion, it would be beneficial to encourage really challenging goals,
objectives that cannot be met with off the shelf systems. one such goal could be deep
space,  to  send  probes  out  towards  nearby  stars,  recognizing  that  such  a  mission
would  last  perhaps  centuries.  The  task  would  set  new  standards  for  advanced  pro-
pulsion,  ultra  light  structures,  sensors  and  power  systems,  plus  extreme  reliability.
Another goal might be comprehensive and ongoing multi-spectral Earth observation.
To  properly  assess  the  implications  of  the  geyser  of  environmental,  economic  and
military  data  such  a  system  would  generate  represents  the  data  management  chal-
lenge of the century, but the rewards are proportionate.

Questions submitted by Chairman Ken Calvert
Q1. The  Federal  Government  invests  large  sums  of  money  in  space  and  aeronautics
research  and  development.  From  an  economic  perspective  which  has  a  greater
return  on  investment  for  the  U.S.  economy,  investments  in  space  or  investments
in aeronautics?

A1. I appreciate the importance of this question, as the answer should guide budg-
etary  allocations  for  both  of  these  fields.  However,  I  have  not  and  do  not  know  of
any  economic  analyses  comparing  these  investments  on  an  apples-to-apples  basis
(that is, with comparable methods, time periods, and other modeling criteria).
Q2. Are  there  specific  areas  within  either  space  or  aeronautics  that  have  a  particu-

larly high return on investment for the overall economy?

A2. Although  I  am  not  aware  of  studies  that  can  provide  an  answer,  the  field  of
economics  usually  argues  that  government  investment,  as  differentiated  from  pri-
vate  sector  investment,  has  the  higher  return  and  the  less  potential  to  crowd  out
private investment when made on innovation that is generic, hence hard for private
investors to capture a return.

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. What future markets do you see for the commercial remote sensing industry?
A1. I  see  at  least  three  markets.  One  market  is  providing  services  to  operational
civil  and  military  government  agencies,  as  implemented  by  funding  awards  to  the
commercial industry from the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. On the civil
side, the Federal Government has yet to provide a ‘‘one-stop’’ agency through which
government  can  arrange  for  imagery  purchases  to  support  activities  of  the  EPA,
DOI,  Dept.  of  Agriculture,  Dept.  of  Energy,  and  other  agencies.  Yet  the  market
seems to be there. For instance, while not a federal agency data purchase, the State
of Hawaii has recently arranged to buy Quickbird imagery from DigitalGlobe to map
rainy terrain in Kauai County. It is key that the imagery had to be of adequate res-
olution to meet the requirements of FEMA’s Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (see
Space  News,  6  June  2005,  p.  13).  It  is  also  worth  noting  that  the  products  that  the
commercial remote sensing industry provides are derivatives of sensor instrumenta-
tion and spacecraft bus designs pioneered by NASA’s four decades’ of remote sensing
science and technology.

A  second  market  is  sales  to  commercial  markets—agribusiness,  real  estate,  utili-
ties, etc. Here, the commercial markets are still coming up to speed in terms of hav-
ing  the  expertise  and  technology  in  place  for  making  use  of  imagery.  At  the  same
time, the commercial imagery world needs to better develop and market its products
for the commercial sector. The commercial imagery world still is quite provincial in
producing products with limited general appeal.

A third market yet to be tapped is that of providing imagery and other data from
space assets for the purpose of monitoring compliance with domestic environmental
regulation and international environmental agreements.
Q2. What  do  you  consider  to  be  the  biggest  obstacles  to  growth  and  sustainability

of the commercial remote sensing industry?

A2. I see the biggest obstacles to be:

— failure to market more consumer-oriented, easy to use and understand prod-
ucts.  This  calls  for  better  annotation  of  imagery  as  well  as  a  Microsoft-ap-
proach to product design.

— failure to think outside the government procurement mechanisms to exercise

more mainstream, consumer-oriented pricing and marketing

— a  possible  concern  about  innovation  and  R&D,  typically  the  role  of  NASA.
Cutbacks in the Earth science budget may not ensure that our remote sens-
ing industry remains state-of-the-art.

STATEMENT OF HERBERT F. SATTERLEE, III

CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, DIGITALGLOBE, INC.

Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and Members of the Subcommittee, I would
like  to  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  discuss  the  future  market  for  commercial
space and specifically as it pertains to the remote sensing and satellite imagery in-
dustry.  I  am  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  DigitalGlobe,  a  commer-
cial  remote  sensing  and  satellite  imagery  and  information  company  based  in
Longmont, Colorado.

There are three commercial imagery companies currently operating in the United
States, each with one satellite on orbit. Launched in 2001, DigitalGlobe’s QuickBird
satellite  offers  the  world’s  highest  resolution  imagery  commercially  available  at  61
centimeter  resolution.  Thornton,  Colorado-based  Space  Imaging  and  Dulles,  VA-
based  ORBIMAGE  operate  the  IKONOS  and  OrbView3  satellites  respectively,  both
at  approximately  one  meter  resolution.  All  three  companies  provide  unclassified,
high  resolution  satellite  imagery  to  government  and  commercial  customers  world-
wide for a variety of market applications such as defense and intelligence, homeland
security, agriculture, forestry, oil and gas, environmental assessment, disaster plan-
ning, mitigation and recovery, flood insurance mapping, transportation and more.

Despite  the  vast  range  of  potential  markets  for  commercial  satellite  imagery,  the
industry  has  been  slower  to  develop  than  originally  anticipated.  Still,  the  industry
sees steady commercial growth with each fiscal quarter, and increased interest and
demand  from  government  and  commercial  customers.  Strong  U.S.  Government  an-
chor-tenant  commitments  have  helped  this  industry  maintain  momentum  as  it  de-
velops commercial markets, and a continued commitment from the U.S. Government
will be necessary until the full commercial market develops. These markets will not
fully  develop  until  we  address  the  expensive  and  risky  nature  of  the  commercial
space  business  which  inhibits  the  realization  of  the  industry’s  full  potential.  The
cost  of  access  to  space  has  been  a  tremendous  barrier  to  entry,  and  will  continue
to stifle industry’s progress in making this business profitable. In order for the U.S.
commercial satellite imagery industry to remain competitive with foreign and other
domestic competitors and achieve its maximum potential, the cost of access to space
needs to be significantly reduced.
Access to Space is a Competitive Discriminator

DigitalGlobe, clearly the leading commercial satellite imagery company in the re-
mote  sensing  industry,  has  been  in  operation  since  2001  with  the  launch  of  our
QuickBird  satellite.  DigitalGlobe  won  the  industry’s  largest-ever  U.S.  Government
contract  in  2003,  and  just  recently  signed  the  biggest,  most  prominent  commercial
contract the industry has ever seen. However, in recognizing these accomplishments
and  celebrating  our  successes,  we  must  not  forget  the  long,  tumultuous  road  we’ve
traveled and the challenges that lie ahead for DigitalGlobe and the entire industry.
Because of the tremendous cost associated with launching and operating commer-
cial  satellite  imaging  systems,  it  is  an  extremely  risky  business.  One  of  the  most
significant  challenges  in  successfully  getting  three  companies  to  orbit  has  been  the
cost  of  access  to  space  (including  the  consequent  insurance  premiums).  All  three  of
the  commercial  U.S.  operators  struggled  to  enter  the  market,  each  having  experi-
enced at least one launch or on-orbit failure. Approximately fifty percent of the cost
to put DigitalGlobe’s QuickBird system in orbit was related to launch and insurance
costs,  totaling  tens  of  millions  of  dollars.  Access  to  space  in  the  past  has  been  one
of biggest barriers to building a successful commercial industry, and it will continue
to be a major discriminator in the future.

Although  the  commercial  satellite  imagery  industry  has  several  benefits  over  its
market  rival,  the  aerial  photography  industry,  it  nevertheless  experiences  a  major
competitive  disadvantage.  The  cost  to  develop  and  fly  a  commercial  aerial  photog-
raphy  sensor  in  an  airplane  is  far  less  expensive  than  the  cost  to  build  and  launch
a commercial imaging satellite; yet, to stay viable, commercial satellite imagery pro-
viders  must  offer  pricing  competitive  to  that  of  the  aerial  photography  companies.
Not  only  does  our  industry  see  competition  from  domestic  competitors,  but  also
from foreign satellite imagery providers. Foreign competitors are gaining a foothold
in  the  global  marketplace,  and  subsidization  from  foreign  governments  is  a  signifi-
cant contributing factor. The U.S. companies make up the only truly commercial in-
dustry,  having  launched  three  satellites,  all  financed  through  private  capital.  For-
eign  providers  enjoy  partial  or  full  subsidization  from  their  governments,  enabling
them to more quickly realize a profit.

As the Commission on the Future of the Unites States Aerospace Industry identi-
fied,  ‘‘the  cost  to  orbit  is  an  essential  ingredient  for  progress.’’  The  cost  of  access  to

space needs to be significantly reduced in order for the U.S. commercial satellite im-
aging  industry  to  remain  competitive  with  foreign  and  other  domestic  competitors.
The U.S. Government–Industry Partnership: A Mutual Reliance

In  part  because  of  the  high  cost  for  access  to  space,  the  commercial  satellite  im-
agery  operators  have  had  to  rely  on  significant  U.S.  Government  contracts  to  sus-
tain  the  industry  while  we  grow  the  commercial  markets.  Long-term  U.S.  Govern-
ment  commitments  such  as 
the  National  Geospatial–Intelligence  Agency’s
ClearView  and  NextView  contracts  have  been  key  factors  in  allowing  the  industry
to attract the private investment necessary to serve fixture commercial markets. In-
dustry seeks a similar level of commitment from the U.S. civil government agencies
to help grow our businesses and markets.

While  the  U.S.  Government  has  made  a  significant  investment  in  the  industry,
it  receives  tremendous  value  in  return.  As  President  Bush’s  2003  Commercial  Re-
mote  Sensing  Space  Policy  recognized,  a  robust  commercial  satellite  imagery  sector
will ‘‘advance and protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,’’ ‘‘foster
economic growth, contribute to environmental stewardship, and enable scientific and
technological excellence.’’ To this end, the President directed U.S. Government agen-
cies  to  ‘‘rely  to  the  maximum  practical  extent  on  U.S.  commercial  remote  sensing
space  capabilities’’  and  ‘‘develop  a  long-term,  sustainable  relationship  between  the
United States Government and the U.S. commercial remote sensing space industry.’’
By  entering  into  long-term  partnerships  with  industry  and  increasing  its  reliance
on  commercial  satellite  imagery,  the  U.S.  Government  is  able  to  realize  increased
cost savings, streamline requirements among agencies and reduce duplication of ef-
forts.

U.S. Government reliance on commercial satellite imagery drives further demand
for  and  consumption  of  the  technology.  For  example,  as  the  industry  entered  into
the  marketplace  several  years  ago,  the  initial  demand  from  the  defense  and  intel-
ligence  community  was  slow  to  materialize.  However,  the  reliance  on  commercial
imagery during military operations in Afghanistan and, even more so, in Iraq dem-
onstrated  that  commercial  products  and  services  were  of  even  more  value  than
many  had  previously  imagined.  The  ability  to  share  unclassified  commercial  im-
agery with coalition troops and allies was invaluable, and the capacity of the indus-
try to provide imagery to troops on the ground sometimes within a few hours of col-
lection  was  remarkable.  Because  the  use  of  commercial  satellite  imagery  in  these
two campaigns was proven to be highly successful, the defense and intelligence com-
munities  have  accelerated  the  convergence  of  commercial  technology  with  national
imagery  architectures,  and  will  increasingly  rely  on  commercial  sources  to  meet
their mapping and intelligence needs.

Another area where commercial satellite imagery was a significant factor in help-
ing to complete a vital mission for the U.S. Government and others throughout the

world  was  during  the  Southeast  Asian  tsunami  crisis  in  December  of  2004.  Within
hours  of  the  event,  commercial  satellite  imagery  of  the  devastated  areas  flowed  via
Internet  connection  to  U.S.  and  global  emergency  relief  organizations.  DigitalGlobe
offered  newly  collected  imagery  along  with  archived  data  of  the  same  geographic
areas from our ImageLibrary, enabling relief workers to assess the magnitude of the
damage,  navigate  the  altered  landscape,  determine  where  infrastructure  and  med-
ical  facilities  previously  existed  or  needed  to  be  constructed,  and  decide  on  their
next courses of action.

Data  stored  in  the  ImageLibrary  is  not  only  valuable  for  before-and-after  assess-
ments such as this, but also for assistance in pre-event emergency planning. For ex-
ample,  archived,  yet  current  satellite  imagery  could  be  extremely  useful  in  emer-
gency  response  planning  for  future  tsunamis,  earthquakes,  hurricanes,  forest  fires,
or  other  disasters.  Satellite  imagery  together  with  digital  geographic  information
systems  (GIS)  containing  features  such  as  key  infrastructures  like  roads,  airports
and  utilities,  and  key  installations  like  hospitals,  shelters,  fire  departments,  and
schools can be helpful in planning evacuation and emergency scenarios.

Cultivating Commercial Markets

The  global  exposure  that  the  tsunami  and  military  operations  provided  the  com-
mercial satellite imagery industry has not only been instrumental in increasing the
U.S. Government reliance on the technology, but also in cultivating new commercial
markets. For example, the news media’s use of commercial satellite imagery during
Operation  Iraqi  Freedom  captured  the  attention  of  the  oil  and  gas  industry,  which
is  now  investigating  the  use  of  the  technology  for  vulnerability  assessment,  infra-
structure security and exploration purposes. And, State and local governments have
focused  more  of  their  attention  on  satellite  technology  for  emergency  planning  and
relief, and homeland security purposes. Agriculture is another example of a market
with huge growth potential for our industry. By utilizing new and archived commer-
cial  satellite  imagery  to  assess  crop  and  soil  conditions  and  detect  change,  growers
can make faster, better informed and more accurate crop management decisions, re-
sulting  in  greater  productivity  and  higher  revenues.  The  insurance  industry  can
benefit  from  utilizing  high  resolution  commercial  satellite  imagery  and  elevation
data to determine flood, fire or other hazardous zones. Even professional consumers
such  as  realtors  can  use  commercial  satellite  imagery  and  other  GIS  technology  to

map and identify potentially lucrative land development opportunities by being able
to  analyze  traffic  patterns,  population  growth,  census  data,  and  key  infrastructure
placement.  And  in  addition  to  commercial  businesses,  satellite  imagery  has  even
reached  the  individual  consumer  market  with  the  recent  deal  made  between
DigitalGlobe and the Internet search engine Google to provide Internet surfers with
current satellite imagery of almost any researched location on Earth. The list of po-
tential  commercial  and  consumer  markets  for  commercial  satellite  imagery  goes  on
and  on:  forestry,  environmental  assessments,  transportation,  port  and  airport  secu-
rity, economic development, etc.
Conclusion

After experiencing many bumps along the road, the U.S. commercial satellite im-
agery  industry  is  experiencing  steady  growth  and  success.  However,  the  industry
has had to put its future into the hands of the U.S. Government. Without long-term
U.S.  Government  commitments,  U.S.  companies’  plans  to  begin  their  next  genera-
tion  systems  might  still  only  be  ideas  and  briefing  charts.  Instead,  the  C1earView
and  NextView  programs  have  turned  those  charts  into  hardware  for  both
DigitalGlobe and ORBIMAGE by allowing our companies to attract the hundreds of
millions  of  dollars  in  private  investment  required  to  build  and  launch  our  future
generation systems.

Having  more  commercial  satellite  imaging  assets  in  space  multiplies  the  benefit
for both the U.S. Government and the vast array of potential commercial customers.
However, with launch and insurance costs remaining extraordinarily excessive, gov-
ernment  budgets  facing  deficiencies,  and  foreign  and  domestic  competition  looming,
the  U.S.  commercial  imagery  industry  still  faces  significant  challenges.  More  must
be done to lower the cost of accessing space, or the commercial satellite imagery in-
dustry will be challenged to realize its full potential and provide the innovative solu-
tions on which its government and commercial customers have begun to rely.

BIOGRAPHY FOR HERBERT F. SATTERLEE, III
CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,

DIGITALGLOBE

Mr.  Satterlee  joined  the  DigitalGlobe  team  in  1998,  bringing  more  than  25  years
of  experience  in  business  and  finance  management  for  space,  defense  and  remote
sensing programs. In the face of two satellite failures prior to the successful launch
of  QuickBird  in  2001,  Satterlee  rebuilt  DigitalGlobe  by  refocusing  the  management
team,  boosting  employee  morale  and  confidence,  leading  the  company  out  of  near
bankruptcy  and  securing  the  financing  necessary  to  move  forward  with  plans  to
build  and  launch  QuickBird.  Under  Satterlee’s  direction,  DigitalGlobe  became  fully
operational and began serving customers in 2002. Also under Satterlee’s leadership,
DigitalGlobe was granted a quarter-meter imaging license by the U.S. Government,
and  was  awarded  the  NextView  contract  by  the  National  Geospatial–Intelligence
Agency  in  2003.  Satterlee  will  help  lead  DigitalGlobe  and  the  commercial  remote
sensing  industry  into  the  next  generation  of  imaging  with  the  construction  and
launch  of  the  WorldView  system  no  later  than  2006.  Satterlee  is  member  of  board
of  directors  for  USGIF,  on  the  advisory  committee  for  National  Satellite  Land  Re-
mote  Sensing  Data  Archive,  The  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administra-
tion’s  (NOAA’s)  Advisory  Committee  on  Commercial  Remote  Sensing  (ACCRES),
and a member of MAPPS and ASPRS.

Satterlee  previously  served  as  CEO  of  RESOURCE21  LLC,  a  Denver-based  re-
mote  sensing  information  products  company.  There,  Satterlee  led  the  development
of  aircraft-derived  imagery  information  products  for  the  agriculture  industry.  Prior
to  that,  Satterlee  spent  19  years  working  for  Boeing  Company,  where  he  held  sev-
eral  senior  management  positions.  He  received  a  Bachelor’s  degree  in  business  ad-
ministration,  with  a  specialization  in  finance,  from  Washington  State  University,
and an executive Master’s of business administration degree from the University of
Washington.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PETER H. DIAMANDIS,

PRESIDENT AND CEO, X PRIZE FOUNDATION

Chairman  Calvert  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  permitting  me

to submit this testimony on market development for personal space flight.

Today I wish to brief you on three subjects pertinent to your discovery of the mar-
ketplace  for  space  and  our  ability  to  meet  the  needs  of  that  market  in  the  near  fu-
ture: First, the X–Prize Competition; second, the critical need to support an emerg-
ing  new  crop  of  space  entrepreneurs;  and  third,  the  need  to  embrace  an  increased
level of risk in our exploration of space.
The X–Prize Competition:
The Power of a ‘Prize’ to drive the market

There is a large and vibrant marketplace of individuals willing to pay for the op-
portunity  to  fly  into  space.  Recent  surveys  consistently  indicate  that  more  than  60
percent  of  the  U.S.  public  would  welcome  the  opportunity  to  take  such  a  trip.  The
Futron  organization  quantifies  this  public  space  flight  market  at  more  than  $1  bil-
lion per year, over the next 20 years.

On  October  4,  2004,  Burt  Rutan  and  the  Mojave  Aerospace  team,  supported  by
private  financing  from  Mr.  Paul  Allen,  won  the  ANSARI  X–Prize  Competition—
proving  to  the  world  that  sub-orbital  flight  was  possible  to  develop  in  the  private
sector,  safely,  and  at  low  cost.  But,  this  is  one  vehicle.  I  support  the  notion  that
the  market  will  not  be  served  until  there  are  multiple  vehicles  offering  a  diversity
of competing spaceships serving this market.
The X–Prize Competition

In  1995,  I  proposed  an  idea  that  would  spur  the  industry  into  motion  to  develop
these  myriad  spacecraft.  We  funded  the  $10  million  X–Prize  and  it  was  offered  to
the first private team to privately build a ship and fly three adults to 100 kilometers
altitude, twice within a two-week period. The prize was purposefully funded to sup-
port the development of a spaceship capable of meeting the current market demand.
We announced the X–Prize Competition in May 1996 in St. Louis, under the Arch
with then NASA Administrator Dan Goldin and 20 astronauts, business leaders and
visionaries.  Twenty-seven  teams  from  seven  nations  signed  up  to  compete  over  the
next eight years. During this time, 150 individuals deposited funds to reserve a ride
on the winning vehicle. The market for private space flight was born.

The  result  of  the  X–Prize  competition  was  a  miraculous  rise  in  the  public’s  de-
mand for space flight, coupled with the private sector stepping forward with private
funding  to  develop  the  vehicles.  Additionally,  the  prize  maximized  investment.  For
the  promise  of  a  $10  million  prize,  more  than  $50  million  was  spent  by  the  com-
peting  teams  in  research,  development,  and  testing.  Dozens  of  real  spacecraft  were
actually  built  and  tested.  Compare  this  to  a  $10  million  investment  from  a  govern-
ment procurement program, which historically has resulted in one or two paper de-
signs.

This is Darwinian evolution applied to spaceships. Rather than paper competition
with  selection  boards,  the  winner  was  determined  by  the  ignition  of  engines  and
flight  of  humans  into  space.  Best  of  all,  we  didn’t  pay  a  single  dollar  until  the  re-
sults were achieved.

The bottom line is that prizes work!

NASA’s Centennial Challenges

I’m also very proud of the critical role that the success of the X–Prize Competition
played  in  inspiring  NASA  to  create  the  newly  announced  Centennial  Challenges.
These annual NASA prizes will help encourage out-of-the-box thinking that is sorely
needed  in  our  risk-adverse  space  community.  While  the  annual  budget  for  NASA’s
Centennial Challenges is only $25 million today, I imagine and ask for the Commit-
tee’s support for a future where 2.5 percent of the NASA budget, some $400 million,
would be offered each year. And, what would be truly exciting is to see NASA com-
bine  its  efforts  in  research  with  the  development  efforts  of  the  private  sector—re-
sulting in a two-tiered system of space flight.

Entrepreneurs  can  solve  the  problems  that  large  bureaucracies  cannot.  Prizes
offer  NASA  and  the  U.S.  Government  both  fixed-cost  science  and  fixed-cost  engi-
neering. More importantly, prizes offer NASA the passion and dedication of the en-
trepreneurial mind that cannot be purchased at any price.

I  encourage  the  Committee  to  fully  embrace  and  support  the  use  of  prizes  for

NASA’s future Orbital, Moon and Mars initiatives.

Public Support drives the economic engine

91

As a result of the ANSARI X–Prize Competition, the front pages of Forbes, Inves-
tors  Business  Daily,  Wall  Street  Journal,  Wired,  The  Washington  Post  and  the  New
York Times began to report on a new breed of space entrepreneurs. Companies rep-
resenting  the  X–Prize  teams,  XCOR,  SpaceX,  Zero  Gravity  Corporation  and  Space
Adventures captured both public attention and investor interest. For our space com-
munity,  these  companies  were  the  early  versions  of  Apple,  Microsoft  and  Netscape.
These companies embodied the entrepreneurial ‘‘can-do’’ spirit of America. When the
X–Prize was won, it was the number two story of the year in 2004, headlining more
than 300 newspapers and media outlets worldwide.

Most  of  the  new  space  companies,  including  Zero  Gravity  Corporation  which  I
founded,  are  focused  on  one  specific  market:  Personal  Space  Flight.  Many  of  us  be-
lieve  that  it  is  the  only  commercial  market  that  makes  near-term  sense.  Call  it
space  travel  or  barnstorming,  the  fact  is  that  the  public  will  pay  for  a  chance  to
fly into space. This is a mass market that can yield a profit while developing break-
throughs in launch operations. These two areas are the very essence of what is most
needed to develop a hearty industry.

The  reason  that  space  flight  is  so  expensive  today  is  simple—there  just  isn’t
enough of it. The commercial launch market for satellites is pathetically small, only
15–25  per  year.  The  number  of  human  space  launches  is  even  smaller:  four  Space
Shuttle flights and four Soyuz flights.

What we need is not dozens, but thousands of space flights per year. Flights that
teach us about launch operations—how to refuel, re-tool and re-launch a fleet of re-
usable vehicles.

I recognize that the vehicles resulting from the X–Prize are only sub-orbital ships,
only one-thirtieth the size of today’s orbital ships, but the lessons we will learn from
these vehicles are critical. We will learn about operations, an area in which we are
sorely lacking.

Everyone  knows  that  the  reason  the  Space  Shuttle  costs  so  much  to  operate  is
not the fuel, but its dependence on a standing army of 10,000-plus professionals. We
have  people,  watching  people  watching  people  in  order  to  increase  safety  margins.
In stark contrast, the reason that a crew of six can turn around a Boeing 737 for
its next flight in 20 minutes is the operational robustness achieved through millions
of  flights  conducted  during  the  first  50  years  of  aviation.  Flights  that  began  with
10-minute hops across farmers’ fields grew over time to transatlantic journeys. Our
space  program  has  in  essence  skipped  the  learning  stages  of  these  10-minute  hops
and  went  straight  to  orbital  shots.  We  need  to  practice  and  learn,  but  we  cannot
achieve the flight rates and experience base we need with the Space Shuttle or the
Crew Exploration Vehicle or any other large government program.

The  next  generation  of  X–Prize  vehicles  will  soon  be  competing  in  the  X–Prize
Cup—an  annual  competition  for  rocket-powered  aircraft  and  future  spacecraft.  The
X–Prize  Cup  is  a  partnership  established  between  the  X–Prize  Foundation  and  the
State  of  New  Mexico  under  the  vision  of  Governor  Bill  Richardson—specifically  to
support the new generation of space entrepreneurs. During X–Prize Cup week, there
will  be  an  Education  Day  with  thousands  of  students  learning  about  space,  rocket
demonstrations  and  eventually  races,  and  an  exposition  of  space-related  tech-
nologies. In 2005, we will ‘‘Countdown to the X–Prize Cup’’ at the Las Cruces Inter-
national Airport from October 6–9.

I urge the Committee to join our efforts to recognize the need to support the cre-
ation  of  personal  space  flight,  if  for  no  other  reason  than  to  enable  a  high  flight-
rate and teach us about low-cost, safe and frequent operations of rocket powered ve-
hicles. NASA and the DOD should embrace this new generation of sub-orbital vehi-
cles  to  learn  all  they  can.  Fly  them  frequently.  Learn.  Support  America’s  space  en-
trepreneurs.
ACCEPTING RISK:

Finally  I’d  like  to  address  the  issue  of  risk.  In  contrast  to  individuals  who  speak

about reducing risk, I want to speak in favor of taking more risk.

There is no question that the ANSARI X–Prize Competition involved risk—so does
going  to  the  moon  or  Mars  or  opening  any  portion  of  the  space  frontier.  BUT,  this
is a risk worth taking!

As Americans, many of us forget the debt we owe to early explorers. Tens of thou-
sands  of  people  risked  their  lives  to  open  the  ‘new  world’  and  the  American  West.
Thousands lost their lives crossing the ocean and then the plains—but we are here
today because of their courage.

Space is a frontier and crossing new frontiers is inherently risky! As explorers and
as Americans, we must have the right to take risks that we believe are worthwhile
and  significant.  We  owe  it  to  ourselves  and  to  future  generations.  It  is  also  critical

that we take risk to develop technology. It is critical that we allow for failure. With-
out risk and without failure, we cannot initiate and realize the very breakthroughs
we so desperately need.

A breakthrough, by definition, is something that was considered a ‘‘crazy idea’’ the
day  before  it  became  a  breakthrough.  If  it  wasn’t  considered  a  crazy  idea,  then  it
really  wasn’t  a  breakthrough,  but  an  incremental  improvement.  Remember  those
immortal  words,  ‘‘Failure  is  not  an  option’’. . .if  we  live  and  work  in  an  environ-
ment where we cannot fail, than breakthroughs may not be an option either.

In  summary,  I  urge  the  Committee  to  support  those  efforts  that  will  allow  us  to
realize  our  dreams  of  space  exploration.  Support  prizes  as  the  most  efficient  mean
to foster and enable breakthroughs in technology and embrace risk. Help the Amer-
ican people understand that space exploration is risky—but a risk worth taking.

Let’s let space explorers be heroes once again.
