ENERGY  PRICING 

WEDNESDAY,  SEPTEMBER  21,  2005 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10:05  a.m.  in  room 
SD–562,  Dirksen  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Ted  Stevens, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

The  CHAIRMAN.  My  apologies  for  being  a  little  late.  This  is  the 
first  of  two  sessions  today  that  will  address  the  issue  of  energy 
prices.  We’ll  hear,  throughout  the  day,  from  representatives  of  the 
oil  production  and  refinery  sectors  to  consumer  and  trade  groups, 
and the Federal Government. 

Senator  Inouye,  and  I,  thank  our  witnesses  for  being  here  and 

for agreeing to join us on very short notice. 

This hearing examines the short- and long-term rise in domestic 
energy  prices,  and  will  explore  whether  price-gouging  is  occurring, 
or  whether  the  market  is  controlling  prices  in  response  to  an  ab-
normal market circumstance. 

Over the past 2 years, we’ve seen prices triple, with oil prices ris-
ing  to  $70  a  barrel.  The  impact  of  high  energy  prices  can  be  seen 
at all levels of our economy. It has resulted in job losses, trade defi-
cits,  and  constraints  on  consumer  spending  and  economic  growth. 
The consequences of rising energy costs cannot be underestimated. 
All  Americans  feel  the  economic  impact  of  this  crisis.  They’re  pay-
ing more at the pump, and businesses are beginning to pass energy 
costs  on  to  consumers  by  increasing  the  prices  of  basic  goods  and 
services.  I’m  concerned  about  the  allegations  of  consumer  price- 
gouging  in  the  wake  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  particularly  with  re-
spect  to  retail  gasoline.  And  today’s  hearings  will  explore  those  al-
legations. 

Senator Inouye? 
Let me say that we’ve indicated that opening statements by Sen-
ators  will  be  no  more  than  2  minutes,  and  we’ll  listen  to  the  wit-
nesses,  who  will  each  have  10  minutes,  then  we’ll  have  a  round  of 
questions, 5 minutes for each Senator. 

Senator Inouye?

STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

Senator  INOUYE.  Thank  you  very  much.  There  have  been  many 
painful  lessons  in  the  wake  of  the  disaster,  but  two  of  the  most 
critical fall squarely in the jurisdiction of this committee: runaway 
gas  prices,  and  our  economy’s  dependence  upon  oil.  While  the  dis-
ruption of the Gulf Shore production was bound to have an impact 
on  the  prices,  I  believe  that  it  fails  to  explain  how,  for  example, 
consumers in Atlanta, Georgia, were asked to pay $6 a gallon, more 
than  twice  the  national  average.  Many  of  the  markets  saw  similar 
sudden increases. These prices, which, in most cases, now are clos-
er to the national average, suggest to some people, that they’re tak-
ing  advantage  of  a  national  tragedy  to  line  their  pockets,  and  we 
need  to  make  certain  that  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  is  exer-
cising  authority  to  ensure  consumers  pay  fair  prices  for  fuel,  as 
well  as  other  consumer  products.  We  also  need  to  protect  con-
sumers  from  the  excesses  of  market  power  concentrated  in  a  lim-
ited number of energy companies. 

Also,  Katrina  demonstrated  that  this  country  remains  perilously 
dependent  on  oil,  regardless  of  where  it  is  produced.  So,  I  believe 
the  time  is  right  to  re-examine  the  fuel  efficiency  standards  of  our 
automobiles. 

The  Senate  examined  this  issue  in  2002,  and  today  the  cir-
cumstances call for us to return to the issue. Oil demand is the key 
to  our  dependence,  and  a  major  source  of  our  economic  vulner-
ability.  And  it  can  be  an  Achilles  Heel  for  our  Nation,  or  a  chal-
lenge  that  prompts  policymakers  and  our  corporate  citizens  to  be 
international leaders in the effort to reduce consumption. 

So, I look forward to working with you, Mr. Chairman, to address 

these needs. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Inouye follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 
There  have  been  many  painful  lessons  in  the  wake  of  the  Katrina  disaster,  but 
two  of  the  most  critical  fall  squarely  in  the  jurisdiction  of  our  Committee,  runaway 
gas prices, and even more importantly, our economy’s insatiable demand for oil. 

Gas  prices,  already  astronomical  by  U.S.  standards,  skyrocketed  in  Katrina’s 
wake,  and  last  Monday,  they  officially  reached  an  all-time  high,  even  as  adjusted 
for  inflation.  Before  Katrina,  there  was  little  doubt  that  exorbitant  gas  prices  were 
having a sustained, detrimental impact on our economy, not to mention the finances 
of every American household. 

While  the  disruption  to  Gulf  shore  production  was  bound  to  have  an  impact  on 
prices, it failed to explain how, for example, consumers in the Atlanta market were 
asked to pay $6 a gallon, more than twice the national average. Many other markets 
saw  similar,  sudden  increases.  These  jaw-dropping  prices,  which  in  most  cases  are 
now closer to the national average, suggest a rank opportunism that cannot be toler-
ated. 

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is duty-bound to ensure that consumers are 
not  abused,  particularly  in  times  of  national  distress.  The  FTC  is  our  Nation’s  na-
tional  authority  on  price-gouging.  Americans  should  have  every  confidence  that  the 
government, through the FTC, will intervene when commercial entities take blatant 
advantage of national events to gouge consumers, both today or when the next nat-
ural, or man-made, disaster occurs. 

In  addition  to  protecting  consumers  against  price-gouging,  the  FTC  also  reviews 
mergers in the energy industry, an industry which has seen considerable consolida-
tion in recent years. Many have raised concerns that consolidation has concentrated 
market  power  in  too  few  companies  and  that  consumers  can  do  little  but  accept 
steady price hikes.

To  date,  the  FTC  has  taken  a  minimalist  approach  to  examining  the  dramatic 
price changes. The Commission must be vigilant, and it is the responsibility of this 
Committee  to  hold  it  accountable.  If  the  Commission  lacks  specific,  necessary  au-
thorities to pursue price-gouging, or views its consumer role narrowly, then we need 
to provide to them authority and guidance. The FTC’s work can have an important 
effect,  and  recent  price  spikes,  well  beyond  Katrina’s  impact,  indicate  that  its  serv-
ices are needed. 

For  better  or  for  worse,  Hurricane  Katrina  has  shed  light  on  many  of  our  coun-
try’s shortcomings. Setting aside the immediate issue of price-gouging, Katrina and 
its aftermath spelled out in no uncertain terms that this country remains perilously 
dependent  on  oil,  regardless  of  where  it  is  produced.  It  is  a  profound  vulnerability 
that  has  both  economic  and  national  security  implications,  and  we  cannot  continue 
to ignore it. 

Similarly,  we  cannot  have  an  honest  discussion  about  energy  resources  and  pric-
ing  if  we  do  not  examine  our  country’s  growing  demand  for  oil,  a  demand  that  is 
further complicated by the burgeoning economies of China and India. Increased do-
mestic  production,  even  under  the  most  optimistic  forecasts,  does  not  even  begin  to 
dent our escalating appetite for oil, derived primarily from our transportation needs. 
One of the most immediate and effective things we can do to remedy this depend-
ence  is  to  increase  the  fuel  efficiency  standards  of  our  automobiles  in  a  meaningful 
way. The technology currently exists to double our oil efficiency, and employing this 
technology  would  not  only  reduce  our  national  dependence,  it  would  reduce  fuel 
costs  for  every  American.  The  time  has  come  to  make  this  happen  for  the  sake  of 
our long-term economic strength, not to mention our long-term foreign policy. 

Fuel efficiency standards are the jurisdiction of this Committee. As many on this 
panel  will  recall,  we  helped  to  establish  the  Nation’s  first  corporate  average  fuel 
economy  (CAFE)  standards  in  1975,  following  the  oil  crisis  of  the  early  1970s  and 
the growing, national concern over the Nation’s energy security. 

Today,  the  factors  are  equally,  if  not  more,  volatile:  the  unpredictability  of  inter-
national supply, the limits of our domestic supply, the growth of our global competi-
tors,  our  own  escalating  demand,  and  Katrina’s  stark  reminder  of  our  dependence 
and vulnerability. I believe the time is ripe to re-examine the Nation’s fuel efficiency 
standards. It is quickly becoming a national imperative, and this Committee should 
take the lead. 

The  Senate  took  this  on  in  2002,  but  we  did  not  have  the  political  will  to  get  it 
done. Today, the circumstances are different, and the necessity is unambiguous. Oil 
demand  is  the  key  to  our  dependence  and  a  major  source  of  our  economic  vulner-
ability.  It  can  be  a  vice  that  drags  us  down,  or  the  challenge  that  prompts  policy-
makers, and our corporate citizens, to be international leaders in the effort to reduce 
consumption. 

I look forward to hearing more from our witnesses today about how we can better 
protect  our  Nation’s  consumers  from  runaway  gas  prices,  and  how  we  can  curtail 
our  spiraling  oil  demand.  These  are  two  issues  that  will  make  or  break  America’s 
economic future. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Senator Nelson, you are next. 

STATEMENT OF HON. E. BENJAMIN NELSON, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA 

Senator BEN NELSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll be brief. 
Now, I, like many of my colleagues, go home almost every week-
end,  and  I  was  at  home  for  most  of  the  month  of  August.  When  I 
went  around  the  state,  there  was  one  dominating  issue  that  Ne-
braskans wanted to talk to me about, that was before the unfortu-
nate  events  brought  on  by  Hurricane  Katrina—the  high  price  of 
gas. And not just gasoline for their cars, but also rising natural gas 
costs, as well. 

Nebraska’s  people  like  to  talk  about  what’s  going  on  in  their 
lives,  and  I  have  the  good  fortune  of  hearing  a  little  bit  about  ev-
erything. When nine out of ten people are talking to me about gas 
prices,  I  know  it’s  time  to  find  the  answers  to  the  questions  that 
they’re asking.

I  realize  that  inquiries  about  gas  prices  have  been  conducted  in 
the  past,  and  that  they’re  pretty  popular  around  this  time  of  the 
year, because price surges always occur around Labor Day. But, as 
prices  begin  to  fall,  interest  in  determining  why  they  reach  record 
levels  sometimes  diminishes.  But  not  this  year.  People  continue  to 
ask, and they want to know what’s happening. 

According  to  the  American  Petroleum  Institute,  Nebraska  has 
the  distinct  honor  of  being  the  only  state  west  of  Arkansas,  to  see 
prices  jump  more  than  50  cents  per  gallon  since  August  30,  so  I 
have  a  serious  question.  Why  Nebraska?  And  they  want  to  know. 
And we’re going to find out. 

In  many  cases,  we  saw  pump-price  increases  of  20,  30,  40  cents, 
and  even  higher,  in  a  single  day.  Why  such  a  dramatic  increase? 
We need to find out. 

What  role  do  speculators  play  in  establishing  price?  Let’s  find 
out.  Many  have  suggested  that  speculators  and  the  exchanges  are 
there  to  try  to  control  and  stabilize  prices,  rather  than  destabilize 
prices. These questions and others are important. Every part of our 
Nation’s economy is impacted by these increases, including the nat-
ural  gas  prices.  And  I’ll  be  brief  here,  but  I  received  a  letter,  and 
I spoke with the Mayor of Fremont, Nebraska, and in his letter he 
said, ‘‘With the high price of gasoline at the pump receiving all the 
headlines, no one is watching the cost of natural gas.’’ I’m not sure 
that’s the case, but it seems to be the case. 

So,  we’ve  got  a  problem  here.  We’ve  got  a  problem  back  in  our 
home  states.  We  need  to  fix  it.  Many  of  us  in  the  Senate,  in  this 
particular  Committee,  have  introduced  legislation  to  look  into 
price-gouging,  energy  prices,  and  market  manipulations.  We  all 
have the same end goal: to protect the American consumer. So, we 
need  to  find  out  the  answers,  and  I  hope  we  will  make  a  major 
start on that today. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Pryor? 
Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Although,  I  must  say,  I  think  Senator  Cantwell  was  here  before 

me. 

The CHAIRMAN. I’m sorry—— 
Senator  PRYOR.  I  think  she  was  here  before  I  was,  Mr.  Chair-

man. Go ahead. 

The CHAIRMAN. Very well. 
Senator Cantwell? 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Thank  you  for  having  this  hearing.  We  had  a  similar  hearing  in 
the  Energy  Committee  about  a  week  ago,  and  I  think  it  is  of  the 
utmost  importance  to  discuss  what  Congress  can  do  about  preda-
tory pricing and helping the American economy. 

We’ve  already  seen  the  devastation  the  cost  of  fuel,  which  has 
been  increasing  for  the  last  year  and  a  half,  has  had  on  our  econ-
omy.  Just  recently,  we  saw  the  impact  on  the  airline  industry, 
which has experienced a 293 percent increase in jet-fuel prices over 
the  last  several  years.  And,  in  my  state,  we’ve  seen  gas  prices—

5 

even though we’re supposed to be an isolated western market—gas 
prices go from $1.36 a gallon to now over $3 a gallon. 

I  think  it  is  our  responsibility  to  do  something  about  this,  and 
that  is  why  yesterday  I  introduced  legislation,  along  with  20  or  so 
of  my  colleagues,  to  establish  a  Federal  statute  similar  to  laws  al-
ready implemented in about 23 states to allow predatory pricing to 
be  addressed  at  a  national  level.  I  think  this  is  something  we 
should have at the Federal level, and we should institute that leg-
islation as soon as possible. 

But,  in  addition,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  believe  that  our  committee 
should  conduct  a  special  investigation  of  the  oil  industry  and  on 
predatory  pricing.  The  reason  I  say  that  is  this  Committee  has,  in 
the  past,  played  a  vital  role  on  issues  such  as  automobile  mar-
keting practices, freight pricing practices, and port waterfront rack-
eteering. One of our colleagues investigated a company in my state 
in  the  last  year,  and  it  was  Senator  Dorgan’s  ability  to  get  sub-
poena  power,  when  he  was  the  Chairman  of  the  Subcommittee, 
that allowed us to get some documents in the Enron case that were 
so  valuable.  Senator  Smith  played  a  vital  role  in  oversight  of  the 
Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission,  in  getting  them  to  move 
on  the  investigation  of  the  Enron  Corporation  after  they  had 
dropped the ball. 

I  think  it’s  very  critical  that  this  Committee  continue  to  play  a 
role,  and  I  hope  you  and  Senator  Inouye  will  consider  moving  for-
ward  on  those  special  investigations,  so  that  Congress  can  make 
sure that we have the oversight role and responsibility to continue 
to push the FTC and others for getting an investigation done. 

Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Senator Burns? 

STATEMENT OF HON. CONRAD BURNS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA 

Senator BURNS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  think  there  are  some  questions  out  there  that  we  have  got  to 
ask. In the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill, we 
asked the FTC to start their work on an investigation of the price- 
gouging  or  predatory  pricing.  I  don’t  know  how  far  that  will  get. 
It’s hard to define. But I know, in my state—and, like Senator Nel-
son’s, that’s what they’re asking. It’s harvest time. The high use of 
diesel  fuel  to  harvest  the  crop,  get  it  to  market,  and  then  get  it  to 
the  coast  for  export—we  had  an  11  percent  surcharge  put  on  our 
rails. In Montana, we’ve only got one rail, and I think it spurs the 
discussion  again  on  captive-shipper.  The  same  thing  happened  on 
our  coal  that  comes  out  of  our  part  of  the  country,  and  how  that 
affects the energy price of electricity that is being produced around 
the country. It also says a little bit to the huge amounts of natural 
gas  that  we  have  in  this  country  that  we  can’t  get  to.  They  won’t 
allow  us  to  get  to  it.  And  all  of  these—I  think  all  of  these  things 
come  together,  and  Katrina  brought  them  together  for  us,  to  see 
that  some  of  the  policies  that  we’ve  created  in  this  Congress  have 
crippled  us  in  a  way  to  not  only—to  balance  the  supply  and-de-
mand scale, but also to develop.

We’re ahead—again, in agriculture, when you start taking about 
natural gas, because our fertilizer prices are going to go up another 
third  next  year.  And  let  me  tell  you  that  I  got  some  scale  tickets 
the other day, from 1948, from a farmer that sold his wheat at the 
elevator  for  $2.48  a  bushel.  That’s  what  we’re  selling  wheat  for 
right  now.  Now,  how  much  more  can  the  American  people  ask  of 
agriculture, when we buy retail, sell wholesale, and pay the freight 
both ways? And it is crunch time. 

And I thank the Chairman for holding this hearing. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Lautenberg? 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Did  we  pass  Senator  Pryor,  who  was  here 

ahead of me? 

The  CHAIRMAN.  I’m  sorry,  Senator  Pryor.  Thank  you  very  much. 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARIZONA 

Senator  PRYOR.  Thank  you.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank 

you, Mr. Lautenberg. Thank you. 

The CHAIRMAN. You shouldn’t be so gentlemanly. 
Senator PRYOR. Thank you very much. 
I  want  to  first  thank  Senator  Stevens,  and  Senator  Inouye,  for 
holding this hearing today. I wrote them a letter a few weeks ago, 
and  they’ve  been  very  responsive,  very  helpful.  And  I  appreciate 
your  leadership  on  this.  I’m  going  to  echo  some  of  the  comments 
that my colleagues made, but also I want to echo comments I heard 
in  Arkansas  when  I  was  home  over  the  last  few  weeks,  especially 
during  the  August  recess.  Like  your  constituents,  mine  have  gone 
to the gas pumps in recent weeks, recent months, and they’ve filled 
up their tanks at record-high prices. And it’s very difficult for them 
to  then  open  the  business  page  and  see  that  the  oil  companies  are 
making  record-high  profits.  And  that’s  why  I’ve  come  back,  and  I 
want  to  thank  all  of  my  colleagues  who  helped  in  passing  the 
amendment  we  did  on  the  floor  last  week  about  price-gouging  in 
the wake of Katrina. 

But this does impact everybody. It impacts farmers and families. 
And,  you  know,  it  impacts  state  and  local  government,  as  well.  In 
Arkansas, we’re looking at, say, the Arkansas State Police, that it’s 
busting  their  budget  on  their  vehicles  being  on  the  road,  counties 
who  have  road  crews  that,  you  know,  do  county  roads,  et  cetera, 
it’s  busting  their  budgets,  as  well,  not  to  mention  school  districts, 
to keep all the school buses going. So, this has a big impact on ev-
erybody,  every  sector  of  the  country,  and  every  section  of  our  U.S. 
economy.  I’m  afraid  that  it  won’t  take  very  long  at  all  for  this  to 
become very inflationary and very hurtful to the U.S. economy. 

So,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  want  to,  again,  thank  you  for  your  leader-
ship on this, and thank Members of the Committee for their leader-
ship, as well. 
Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR, U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 

7 

Senator  Stevens,  Senator  Inouye,  I  want  to  thank  you  for  holding  this  hearing 
today on an important issue which affects consumers and businesses throughout the 
Nation. 

During  my  travels  in  Arkansas  this  past  August,  I  met  with  Arkansans  from 
every demographic group imaginable, and they all expressed concern and frustration 
over  escalating  gasoline  prices.  This,  mind  you,  was  prior  to  Hurricane  Katrina, 
which  wreaked  havoc  on  our  Gulf  Coast  and  resulted  in  a  further  increase  of  fuel 
prices. 

Farmers,  truckers,  parents,  business  executives  from  companies  both  large  and 
small, all feel the consequences of the dramatic escalation in gasoline prices we have 
witnessed  over  the  last  year.  Furthermore  they  are  all  angry  about  the  substantial 
price hikes they have faced in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. 

I am here today to acknowledge those voices, to ensure my constituents that their 
concerns  are  not  falling  on  deaf  ears,  and  to  work  with  my  colleagues  on  an  ade-
quate public policy response to what could become a severe economic crisis. 

Hurricane Katrina exposed more than inadequate government responses to emer-
gency situations; it also exposed the inability of the oil and gas industries to respond 
to disaster without shortages and unconscionable price-gouging at the pump. 

I  quote  Dr.  Mark  Cooper  of  the  Consumer  Federation  of  America,  who  testified 
yesterday  at  a  similar  hearing  on  gas  prices.  ‘‘If  the  measure  of  performance  of  an 
economic  sector  is  adequate  supplies  at  stable  prices,  then  this  industry  has  failed 
the  consumer,  not  just  in  the  wake  of  Katrina,  but  also  repeatedly  over  the  past 
5 years.’’ 

During  my  tenure  as  Attorney  General  of  Arkansas,  our  state  saw  a  precipitous 
rise in gasoline prices after the events of 9/11. Arkansas statutes allowed me to file 
suit against several retail gas operations who were accused of disruptive trade prac-
tices leading to 11 successful prosecutions. 

While we, as a Committee, do not have the prosecutorial power wielded by an at-
torney  general,  we  do  have  oversight  responsibility  over  Federal  agencies,  such  as 
the  FTC,  that  are  responsible  for  monitoring  energy  markets  to  ensure  that  con-
sumers  are  protected  from  unjust  exercises  in  market  power  by  the  oil  and  gas  in-
dustry.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  the  FTC  and  all  of  the  other  witnesses  here 
today. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. My apology, again, Senator. 
Senator Lautenberg? 

STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
And it’s not unusual to see you leading a fight back when we see 

that people are being taken advantage of. 

We  ought  to  start  in  place,  number  one,  by  getting  tough  with 
the  Saudi  Arabian/OPEC  cartel.  They  drive  the  prices  up  for  gas 
by  imposing  illegal  quotas.  Now,  for  years,  OPEC’s  illegal  quotas 
have  kept  the  price  of  oil  up,  by  keeping  production  down.  So, 
OPEC,  which  sits  on  75  percent  of  the  world’s  oil,  only  pumps  40 
percent of the world’s oil production. And that’s because they’ve in-
tentionally slowed down oil drilling and exploration. 

And  I’ve  introduced  a  bill  that  would  ask  the  Administration  to 
immediately  bring  a  formal  complaint  against  OPEC  in  the  WTO. 
Now,  OPEC’s  tactics  are  illegal  under  WTO  rules.  And  the  Saudis 
and  a  couple  of  the  others  are  not  yet  members.  They  want  to  be. 
But  there  are  rules  in  the  WTO  that  says  no  cartels,  no  compact 
that  engineers  prices  or  trade  barriers  can  be  a  member.  So,  we 
want  to  tell  the  Saudis  that  if  they  want  to  join  the  WTO,  they’ve 
got to play by the rules, and that means no cartel. 

Whenever Saudi Arabia has been in trouble, like when they were 
threatened by Iraq in 1990, they dialed 9-1-1. And what did we do? 
We delivered over a half a million troops to keep that country from

being overtaken. And what do we get from them in return? Manip-
ulation  of  the  oil  markets  so  we  pay  more  at  the  pump.  And  we 
shouldn’t tolerate it. 

So,  the  Administration  needs  to  stop  holding  hands  with  the 

Saudis and start holding them accountable. 

And I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership on this. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you  very  much.  And  I  appreciate  your

limiting it. 

STATEMENT OF HON. BARBARA BOXER, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA 

Senator  BOXER.  Yes,  I  ask  that  my  full  statement  be  placed  in 

the record. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  All  statements  submitted  will  be  in  the  record. 
Senator BOXER. OK. 
So,  first  let  me  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  because  what  I’ve 
found since the mid-1990s when California started getting hit with 
higher  prices  than  any  other  state—and  I  used  to  talk  to  my  col-
leagues  about  this—what  we  found  is,  when  we  shine  the  light  on 
what’s going on, that, in and of itself, seems to have a good impact 
on  the  oil  industry.  And  so,  thank  you  for  this.  I  think  it’s  quite 
important—and  I  thank  the  other  committees  who  are  doing  the 
same thing. 

I  would  say  that  we’ve  learned  a  few  things  in  California,  and 

I want to share them very quickly in this 2 minutes. 

First, we found that when we would contact the FTC, they would 
be  very  responsive,  but,  at  the  end  of  the  day,  whether  they  were 
Democratic  Administration  or  Republican  Administration,  they  did 
very  little.  We  need  to  put  more  focus  on  them  and  give  them,  I 
think,  more  courage  to  act.  For  example,  they  found,  in  my  state, 
zone  pricing  and  redlining.  They  did  place  very,  I  would  consider, 
mild  conditions  on  some  of  the  larger  mergers.  They  did  not  re-
spond  to  our  point  that  refineries  were  being  taken  offline  for  so- 
called  maintenance,  which  was  very  similar  to  what  happened  to 
California  during  the  power  crisis  with  the  Enron  scandal.  We 
found  that,  ‘‘Oh,  gee,  there  were  so  many—so  many  outlets  being 
maintained,’’  when,  in  fact,  it  just  wasn’t  true.  They  were  creating 
artificial shortages. 

Now  we  hear  from  eight  Governors.  They  wrote  to  President 
Bush. And they’re very concerned that the oil companies are taking 
advantage of Hurricane Katrina, and certainly not making any sac-
rifices.  And,  as  Senator  Pryor  said,  we  see  record  profits,  huge 
amounts  of  money  going  to  the  heads  of  these  organizations.  And 
I have no problem with people getting what they deserve, if it’s fair 
and  square.  But  if  our  people  are  suffering,  and  they  can’t  fill  up 
their cars, it doesn’t sound very fair and square to me. 

I think that Senator Cantwell has some very good ideas in legis-
lation she’ll be proposing. I think we really need to have automatic 
investigations when these prices just move so quickly, without any 
reason or rhyme. I think that would have a salutary effect.

And I look forward to hearing from our witnesses. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Boxer follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. BARBARA BOXER, U.S. SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA 
Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  responding  to  my  request  for  holding  this  hearing 

today. 

The  rest  of  the  Nation  is  now  confronting  what  California  has  been  dealing  with 
over  the  last  few  years—extremely  high  gasoline  prices.  In  California,  gasoline  at 
or over $3 per gallon is not a recent event. 

Now that the rest of the country is ‘‘catching up’’ to California, let me share with 
the  Committee,  how,  over  the  years,  I  have  fought  to  protect  Californians  from  un-
fair and unjust gasoline prices. Perhaps there are some lessons to be learned. 

The  first  front  on  which  I  fought  was  in  calling  for  the  Federal  Government  to 

provide oversight of the oil and gasoline market. 

• In  1996,  I  asked  the  Energy  Secretary  to  investigate  possible  price-gouging  in 

California. 

• In August 1997, I asked the Energy Secretary and the Attorney General to take 

the necessary steps to ensure fair gasoline prices for California drivers. 

• In  March  1998,  I  asked  the  FTC  to  launch  an  investigation  of  anti-competitive 

oil company prices throughout California. 

• In  August  1998,  with  several  gas  station  operators,  I  asked  the  FTC  to  open 
a formal investigation of anticompetitive practices in the California oil industry. 
• In  May  1999,  I  asked  the  FTC  to  examine  whether  anti-competitive  activities 

were to blame for slower than anticipated gas price reductions. 

• In April 2002, I asked the FTC to investigate possible anti-competitive behavior 

in the gasoline market. 

• In February 2004, I asked the FTC to investigate the high gasoline price situa-

tion, focusing on manipulation in the market. 

Out  of  all  these  requests  for  the  Federal  Government  to  do  its  job,  during  both 
the  Clinton  and  Bush  Administrations,  the  only  thing  that  the  FTC  did  was  find 
evidence  of  ‘‘redlining.’’  But,  even  then,  they  did  not  do  anything  about  it,  saying 
it wasn’t illegal. 

However, I have found that when I—or others—called for investigations into high 

gasoline prices and possible market manipulation, gasoline prices went down. 

The  second  front  was  in  fighting  to  ensure  that  every  merger  is  carefully  exam-
ined,  so  companies  do  not  have  too  much  market  power.  In  some  cases,  companies 
were forced to divest assets. 

• In  June  1997,  I  asked  the  FTC  to  block  the  proposed  joint  venture  between 
Shell  and  Texaco.  The  FTC  agreed  with  my  concerns  and  required  the  divest-
ment  of  gas  stations  in  the  San  Diego  area  before  allowing  the  joint  venture 
to proceed. 

• In  1998,  I  opposed  the  BP/Amoco  and  the  Exxon/Mobil  mergers  and  asked  the 

FTC to oppose both mergers. 

• I called on the FTC to require oil companies, as a condition of allowing mergers 
to proceed, to guarantee access to oil and gasoline for independent refiners and 
nonbranded  gas  stations.  This  would  promote  competition  to  keep  prices  in 
check. 

• In  June  2001,  I  urged  the  FTC  to  examine  Valero  Energy  Corporation’s  pro-
posed purchase of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corporation and this sale’s po-
tential impact on consumers in California. The FTC required that a refinery be 
sold as a condition of the merger. 

• This year, I told the FTC to oppose Valero Energy Corporation’s planned acqui-
sition of Premcor, as consolidation would further decrease competition in the in-
dustry and drive up prices. 

The third front on which I have fought is to ensure an adequate supply. 
• Last year, I opposed the closing of the Bakersfield refinery by Shell. Eventually, 
contrary to Shell’s original intention, the refinery was sold and production con-
tinued. 
• I  have  worked  to  ensure  that  refineries  are  not  taken  off-line  under  the  guise 

of routine maintenance.

tation of oil from Alaska’s North Slope. 

• In  the  106th  and  107th  Congresses,  I  introduced  legislation  to  ban  the  expor-
• I have repeatedly urged the President to pressure OPEC to increase production 
and to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). We were repeatedly told that 
opening  SPR  would  have  no  effect.  Well,  SPR  is  finally  being  used  and  so  far 
it appears to be helping. 

The  fourth  front  is  increasing  efficiency.  We  need  to  increase  CAFE  standards, 

which is in this Committee’s jurisdiction, and promote hybrids. 

This  summer,  NHTSA  proposed  a  new  CAFE  standard  for  SUVs.  However,  it  is 
not a meaningful increase. The technology exists for good fuel efficiency. The Toyota 
hybrid Prius gets over 50 miles per gallon in the city. 

Mr.  Chairman,  these  are  the  lessons  of  past  experience:  we  should  be  protecting 
American  consumers  with  greater  oversight  of  the  oil  and  gasoline  industry,  by  en-
suring  an  adequate  supply  of  oil  and  gasoline,  and  by  promoting  efficiency.  What 
we  should  not  do  is  just  sit  by  and  watch  the  oil  companies’  profits  increase  at  the 
expense of the American consumer. 

Let  me  talk  briefly  about  those  profits  because  there  seems  to  be  a  complete  dis-
connect between what is happening in the market and oil company profits. Over the 
same period as last year, 2005 first-quarter profits are skyrocketing: Exxon-Mobil— 
up 44 percent, BP—up 29 percent, Shell—up 38 percent, and ConocoPhillips—up 80 
percent. This is far more than crude oil prices have increased. 

Exxon  Mobil  announced  it  is  raking  in  profits  of  $110  million  a  day,  60  percent 
higher  than  its  daily  profits  a  year  ago.  At  this  rate,  the  company  will  achieve  a 
profit  of  $10  billion  this  quarter,  which,  according  to  the  Boston  Herald,  would  be 
more net income than any American company has ever made in a quarter. 

We  have  a  responsibility  to  protect  the  American  consumer.  This  Committee 

should begin with the following steps. 

First,  pass  Senator  Cantwell’s  bill  that  gives  the  FTC  explicit  authority  to  inves-
tigate  gasoline  price-gouging,  and  new  authority  to  prohibit  anti-competitive  activi-
ties. 

Second,  pass  my  bill  that  would  require  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  (FTC)  to 
automatically  investigate  the  gasoline  market  for  manipulation  whenever  prices  in-
crease at a very rapid rate. 

Third, pass legislation to increase CAFE standards. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Senator Allen? 

STATEMENT OF HON. GEORGE ALLEN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA 

Senator  ALLEN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you  for  expe-
diting  this  hearing  on  a  very  important  matter.  All  our  thoughts 
and  prayers  are  with  the  people  in  southeast  Louisiana,  Mis-
sissippi,  and  Alabama,  and  those  who  are  working  to  restore  their 
lives. 

This disaster of Katrina points out something that I’ve been say-
ing a long time, and I know this is your shared views, as well, Mr. 
Chairman, and that is our energy policy in this country affects our 
national security, our jobs, and also our competitiveness. 

There  are  several  things  that  have  been  pointed  out  here  that  I 
think  need  to  be  addressed.  Number  one  is  the  demand.  Number 
two is the regulations. Number three is the supply. 

Insofar  as  the  supply  is  concerned,  we  do  need  to  get  more  pro-
duction  of  natural  gas  and  oil  in  this  country.  It’s  important  for 
manufacturing, as Senator Burns said, as well as transportation. 

Insofar  as  regulations  are  concerned,  the  President  suspended  a 
slew  of  regulations  to  make  sure  that  we  did  get  natural  gas  and 
oil to more people. One of those has to do with refineries and these 
rules  that  are  in  effect,  where  there  are  about  a  hundred  different 
boutique fuels in our refineries that are at full capacity. I think we 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  15:23 May 10, 2011 Jkt 066218 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\66218.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

11 

ought  to  look  at  some  of  these  regulations  to  see  if  they  ought  to 
be modified permanently, not just for a few weeks or a few months. 
And Senator Burr, and I, on the Energy Committee are working on 
a measure to say let’s pick—say that the top three or five cleanest- 
burning  fuels,  and,  for  nonattainment  areas,  pick  those  three  or 
five,  as  opposed  to  having  50-plus  different  formulations,  which 
means  refineries  are  blending  or  formulating  on  specialty  fuels. 
And  that’s  something  that  I  want  to  listen  to  our  experts  on,  on 
that. 

I also think that, on the demand side, we need to be making sure 
that  oil  and  natural  gas  that’s  being  used  for  fertilizer,  chemical, 
tire,  forestry  property—forestry  products,  and  manufacturing,  as 
opposed to using it for electricity. Electricity in this country, which 
is  so  important,  ought  to  be  generated  by  either  clean  coal  tech-
nology  or  advanced  nuclear.  And  I  think  those  are  the  ways  that 
we’re  going  to  need  to  move  forward,  learning  from  Katrina,  but 
also  improving  on  the  energy  policy  bill  that  we’ve  passed.  But 
there’s  more  to  be  done  to  make  sure  that  we  have  an  affordable, 
and  reliable,  supply  of  energy  for  consumers,  as  well  as  our  econ-
omy. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Smith? 

STATEMENT OF HON. GORDON H. SMITH, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON 

Senator  SMITH.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I’d  like  to  add  a  bi-
partisan  voice  to  what  I’m  sure  many  of  my  colleagues  have  been 
saying. 

I  have  come  to  believe  that  there  are  commodities,  and  then 
there  are  commodities  so  essential  to  the  lives  of  people  that  they 
deserve an extra measure of protection. And I have come to believe 
that the Federal Trade Commission needs some additional powers. 
For that reason, today I have introduced a bill called the Post-Dis-
aster Consumer Protection Act of 2005. This will provide additional 
authorities  to  FTC  to  prevent  oil  and  gas  price-gouging  in  the  im-
mediate aftermath of a declared disaster. 

The  President  has  to  declare  a  disaster  under  the  Stafford  Act. 
And,  for  30  days  following  the  disaster  declaration,  under  my  bill, 
it would be unlawful to engage in any kind of price-gouging for oil 
or  gas  products.  The  bill  defines  ‘‘price-gouging’’  as  a  gross  dis-
parity  in  price  for  products  charged  after  the  disaster  declaration, 
as  compared  to  prices  charged  by  the  same  supplier  during  the  30 
days immediately preceding the disaster. Price gouging will not in-
clude  price  increases  attributable  to  increased  wholesale  or  oper-
ational  costs,  international  market  trends,  loss  of  production  capa-
bility, or loss of pipeline transmission capability. 

The bill authorizes the FTC to determine what represents a gross 
disparity  in  pricing.  The  FTC  will  be  authorized  to  punish  viola-
tions under the Act, using existing authorities under the FTC Com-
mission  Act.  Those  authorities  include  seeking  civil  penalties  of 
$11,000  per  violation,  assessing  fines  and  repayment  of  illegal 
gains,  freezing  assets,  and  seeking  preliminary  injunctions,  cease 
and desist orders, or temporary restraining orders.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  believe  this  bill  ought  to  be  in  the  mix,  and  I 
know many other Senators have their own versions. But I think at 
least  this  much  should  be  done.  In  the  months  and  years  ahead, 
as  energy  becomes  increasingly  more  expensive,  I  think  that  the 
American  people  deserve,  and  we  ought  to  provide,  additional  pro-
tections  to  them.  This  commodity  is  no  longer  like  most  commod-
ities. This one is essential to the American way of life and the abil-
ity of people, particularly in rural areas, to make their way. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. I understand that, and I thank the Chair-

man. 

My main concern is with respect to first responders in West Vir-
ginia  and  other  places,  that  the  fuel  isn’t  going  to  be  there  for 
them. It isn’t there now. And I worry about that. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I’ve  just  got  something  in  my  heart.  I  picked  up 
the  paper  this  morning,  and  I  read  that  a  member  of  the  Wash-
ington  Nationals  Baseball  Team,  one  Ryan  Church,  said  that, 
‘‘Jews shall not receive salvation.’’ And it—we have Bud Selig here, 
and  we  do  steroids.  We  talk  about  that.  Steroids  are  bad  for  base-
ball,  bad  for  young  people.  We  also  don’t,  on  this  Committee,  try 
to  encourage  hate  and  racial  bigotry.  Ryan  Church  said  he  apolo-
gized  for  the  statement,  didn’t  mean  it.  But,  of  course,  if  he  said 
it,  it’s  exactly  what  he  did  mean.  And  I  would  just  put  out  to  the 
Committee  the  thought  of  statements  like  that  being  made  as  dif-
ferent groups are bringing people together for spiritual enrichment 
before games, it should not ever be tolerated, and that there should 
be  a  punishment  for  that,  as  there  should  be  for  steroids,  because 
it’s far worse. 

I thank the Chair. 
The CHAIRMAN. Well, thank you very much. 
And I thank you all for your brevity. 
Our first witness—panel this morning is going to be—we’re going 
to  ask  them  to  limit  their  statements  to  10  minutes  each.  Those 
this  afternoon  will  be  limited  to  5  minutes  each.  We  expect  a  full 
attendance  here  at  this  hearing,  and  if  we’re  all  to  have  an  oppor-
tunity to participate, we do need to limit our time. 

Let  me  call  first  on  J.  Robinson  West,  who’s  Chairman  of  PFC 
Energy. They are listed as strategic advisors in global energy. And 
he  will  be  followed  by  Mr.  Bustnes,  who  is—is  that  the  right  way 
to  say  it?  Bustnes—who  is  really  from  the  Rocky  Mountain  Insti-
tute. And we ask that you limit your statements to 10 minutes. All 
statements  presented  by  witnesses  will  be  printed  in  the  record, 
subject to limitation, in terms of attachments. 

Thank you.

I  have  submitted  a  fairly  long  statement,  which  I  will  not  wade 
through.  There  are  some  points  I’d  like  to  make  in  picking  up  on 
some  of  the  comments  the  members  of  the  Committee  have  made, 
but let me begin. 

First,  as  you  look  at  the  question  of  energy,  and  particularly  oil 
and  gas,  I  think  I  would  respectfully  submit  that—look  at  this  as 
a  business  that  involves  companies,  governments,  and  markets, 
and  that,  as  you  look  at  policy,  understand  investment  patterns, 
understand  markets,  because  that’s,  in  the  end,  what’s  going  to 
drive  things,  also  recognize  that  this  is  a  global  market.  The—one 
Senator  said  that  the  state  was  an  isolated  market,  isolated  west-
ern  market.  There  are  no  isolated  markets.  This  is  a  global  com-
modity, and we’re operating way, way beyond U.S. boundaries. 

There  are  a  couple  of  points  I’d  like  to  make.  The  first  is  that, 
I think, Hurricane Katrina demonstrated that the markets are very 
tight,  to  the  point  of  fragility.  And  if  nothing’s  done,  it’s  going  to 
get even tighter. 

The CHAIRMAN. Pull that mike up a little bit, please. 
Mr. WEST. OK. Is this better? 
Senator  Cantwell  very  properly  pointed  out  that  something’s 
been  going  on  for  the  last  year  and  a  half.  This  is—what’s  going 
on has been happening a long time before Katrina. Katrina pointed 
out  a  problem,  but,  structurally,  something’s  been  going  on  for 
years.  And  the  markets  are  very,  very  fragile,  and,  over  time,  we 
believe they’re going to be even more fragile, which will have huge 
impact on the economy, a huge negative impact. 

My  little  testimony  in  my  paper  was  called  ‘‘Energy  Insecurity.’’ 
‘‘Energy security,’’ we defined as reliable supply at reasonable cost. 
I  would  respectfully  submit  we  are  entering  the  age  of  ‘‘energy  in-
security,’’ where we have unreliable supply at unreasonable cost. 

Katrina—as  I  say,  things  were  very  tight,  and  Katrina  tipped 
things.  Production  in  the  Gulf,  it  dropped  by  a  million  and  a  half 
barrels.  It’s  still  down  by  850,000  barrels.  It  stopped  deliveries  of 
crude  oil  to  refineries  serving  the  mid-continent.  It  stopped  deliv-
eries  of  products  which  are  moved  by  pipeline  to  the  East  Coast 
and  Florida.  And  it  shut  in  refining  capacity—initially  at  15  per-
cent of the Nation—now it’s down by 5 percent. 

I believe, in my business, that markets set prices, that generally 
the oil and gas markets are efficient transparent markets. And one 
of  the  points  I  think  is  important  to  recognize  is  that  the  inter-
national oil companies are now relatively small factors in that mar-
ket,  that  the  market  is  set  by  supply-and-demand,  and  it  takes 
years  setting  these  forces  of  supply-and-demand  in  motion,  and 
also  that  the  market  moves  in  expectations  of  further,  either  sup-
ply, or demand. 

I  also  believe—and  I  think  my  colleague  here  today—if  you  look 
at  the  situation,  we  cannot  supply  our  way  out  of  this.  We  are,  in 
the end, going to have to deal with demand. We must deal with de-
mand.  I  think  there  are  some  supply  issues  which  can  be  dealt 
with, but, long-term, we’re going to have to deal with demand. 

I  think  one  of  the  things,  also,  that’s  important  is  that—one 
myth  that’s  important  to  dispel  is  the  notion  that  the  oil  industry 
has not invested in refining in the United States. That’s simply not 
true. They have not built new refineries. But, frankly, given regula-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  15:23 May 10, 2011 Jkt 066218 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\66218.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

14 

tion right now, you effectively cannot build new refineries. But they 
have expanded capacity from about 15 million barrels—over 15 mil-
lion barrels a day to over 17 million barrels a day. And I think it’s 
about  a  7-  or  8-year  period,  the  industry  spent  about  $49  billion— 
$17 billion in capital, $31 billion in operation and maintenance. 

So  that  it’s—I  don’t  think  it’s  fair  to  say  that  the  industry  has 
ignored  refining.  It’s  important,  as  I  also  pointed  out,  that  the  re-
fining  business  has  historically  been  quite  an  unprofitable  busi-
ness. It’s a very, very difficult business to make money in. 

I  think  one  of  the  things  to  keep  in  mind,  therefore,  is  that  the 
oil industry is not a utility, and that it is not a cost-plus business, 
and—it  is  a  supply  and-demand  business,  and  if  you  are  going  to 
mandate  price  caps  or  do  things  like  this,  this,  in  turn,  will  drive 
behaviors, which I don’t think will actually lead to more supply, or 
better prices for consumers. 

And,  you  know,  frankly,  when  the  oil  price  crashed,  in  1985  to 
2000,  the  consumers  benefited  enormously.  And  that’s  fine.  That’s 
how  markets  work.  And  I  think  markets  will  correct  themselves. 
And I think it’s important that the government play a constructive 
role in making sure that the markets protect themselves. 

I  was  an  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Interior.  I  ran  the  largest 
nonfinancial auction in the history of the world, which was the Off-
shore  Leasing  Program.  And  I  have  come  to  recognize—is  that  the 
government  is  an  active  participant  in  markets  all  the  time.  But 
the  problem  is,  is  that  a  lot  of  people  don’t  understand  how  the 
government  is  a  participant.  Sometimes  it  withholds  resources,  by 
permitting  it  makes  things  more  difficult,  through  environmental 
regulation  it  changes  behavior.  And  I  think  it’s  very  important  to 
understand  the  role  of  government,  because  it  is  a  very  important 
factor in the government—or in the market. Sometimes people say, 
‘‘Well,  don’t  do  anything.’’  But  what  you’re  doing  at  times  is  freez-
ing  the  existing  role  of  government,  which  can  be  very  unproduc-
tive. 

I will stop there, Mr. Chairman. As I say, I have a—I’d be happy 
to  go  through  details  of  my  testimony  here.  I  also  would  be  happy 
to  discuss  with  members  of  the  Committee,  I  think,  some  steps 
which  could  be  taken  to  alleviate  the  situation,  short-term  and 
longer-term. 

So— 
The CHAIRMAN. You still have a few minutes. Do you want to ex-

pand on that? 

Mr.  WEST.  Well,  let  me—I  would  say,  if  you—a  couple  of  points, 
in  terms  of  the  short-term.  First  thing,  be  very  careful  not  to  do 
things which are unwise. If the government is going to interfere in 
the market, please do so carefully, and understand the implications 
of  what  you’re  going  to  do.  This  has,  with  all  due  respect,  not  al-
ways been the case. 

Second,  I  think  it’s  very  important  to  recognize  that—I’m  in  the 
energy  consulting  business,  and  I  have  gone  to  countless  meetings 
in windowless rooms with half-empty styrofoam cups with cold cof-
fee,  debating  with  people  from  oil  companies,  auto  companies,  the 
government, and some other gurus about what to do. It was a real-
ly  tiny  debate,  that  had  very,  very  little  influence.  This  debate 
must  change.  And  people  have  to  recognize  that  they’re  stake-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  15:23 May 10, 2011 Jkt 066218 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\66218.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

15 

holders in the energy economy. And I would argue that the AARP, 
farmers, homebuilders, there are a lot of stakeholders. Energy is a 
big deal. And a lot of people simply haven’t weighed in. 

So, I think you’ve got to change the debate. And I think, frankly, 
it  has  got  to  be—this  is  a  very,  very  sensitive  issue.  A  number  of 
politicians  are  saying—a  number  of  Senators  that  were  back  in 
their  home  district—how  enraged  their  voters  were.  They’re  very 
concerned about gasoline prices. It’s very difficult to come between 
voters  and  their  cars,  and  I  think  that  we’ve  got  to  develop  con-
stituencies  which  make  it  easier  to  do  sensible  things,  which  does 
not  necessarily  mean  higher  taxes  or  changing  CAFE.  There  are  a 
lot of other things that can be done. 

Third,  that  I  think  that  we  have  to  recognize  that  this  is  a  na-
tional  problem,  and  that  national  interests  have  to  prevail,  that  a 
lot of times it is local interests which have blocked necessary solu-
tions.  I  think  the  Congress  should  be  congratulated  for  what  they 
did on LNG siting. This is a case of—we need LNG receiving termi-
nals. It’s a national problem. I testified, several years ago, in front 
of  Senator  Hagel  on  this  subject,  and  finally—and  I  congratulate 
the Congress on moving it. 

The  fourth  thing  is  permitting  and  policy  clarification.  Senator 
Allen  talked  about  boutique  fuels,  but  please  be  aware  that—and 
he’s absolutely correct, I might add—but boutique fuels are also an 
issue  which  involves  state  and  local  government,  as  well.  And  I 
think  that  the  situation  will  be  greatly  compounded  if  the  Federal 
Government  acts  without  working  closely  with  the  states  and  the 
local governments. This is a very important problem. 

There are two other areas that I would urge. One is that I think 
Katrina  has  indicated  that  there’s  a  real  tightness  in  the  market. 
And  one  of  the  ways  to  alleviate  the  tightness  is  to  increase  man-
datory  stock  levels  of  petroleum  products  held  by  the  companies. 
And  this  should  be  held  in  their  plants,  near  markets.  And  you 
should  also  recognize  that  there’s  a  cost  to  the  companies  on  this, 
and  some  way  should  be  found  to  work  it  out  with  them.  But  I 
think  we  should  be  maintaining  larger  inventories  of  petroleum 
products near markets. 

I  think  the  other  thing  that’s  just  been  demonstrated  is  in  the 
operations  of  refineries  and  pipelines.  Some  of  the  big  pipelines  to 
the East Coast went down simply because of electricity and pumps, 
and  things  like  that.  I  think  it’s  clear  that  there  should  be  oper-
ating  standards  so  that  there  is  redundancy  in  pumps,  electricity, 
and  that  sort  of  thing,  so  that  the  system  is  less  fragile.  I  think 
those  are  two  relatively  easy  fixes,  and  ones  which  should  be  un-
dertaken quickly. 

I have some longer-term views, but I think my time’s up. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. West follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF J. ROBINSON WEST, CHAIRMAN, PFC ENERGY 

Energy Insecurity 

Hurricane  Katrina  was  a  natural  disaster  of  unprecedented  proportions.  It  not 
only  demolished  a  swath  of  the  Gulf  Coast  and  destroyed  thousands  of  lives,  but 
with the ensuing rise in energy prices, there was also a fear that it would demolish 
the economy as well.

16 

Katrina  has  brought  home  the  realization  that  Americans  have  entered  a  new 
age, the age of Energy Insecurity. For the last twenty years, we have lived in a pe-
riod  of  energy  security,  where  we  had  ample  and  reliable  supplies  at  a  reasonable 
cost. Those days are over. Supplies are tight, may not be reliable, and fears of short-
ages have sent oil and gas prices skyrocketing. 

To  understand  oil  and  gas  markets,  one  must  examine  the  fundamentals  of  sup-
ply-and-demand,  which  have  radically  changed  in  the  last  twenty  years,  together 
with two trends: nationalization and financialization in the industry. 

For  much  of  the  twentieth  century,  the  oil  markets  were  managed  by  the  large, 
vertically-integrated (from oil well to gas pump) ‘‘Majors.’’ Until the early 1960s, the 
Majors explored and produced oil, virtually everywhere with the exception of Russia 
and Mexico. By the 1960s, however, major oil-producing countries felt that they had 
not received their fair share of the oil revenues from the international industry, and 
began  to  nationalize  their  oil  and  gas  resources,  creating  National  Oil  Companies 
(NOCs)  to  manage  these  resources.  This  process  was  completed  by  the  late  1970s, 
as  the  Majors  were  pushed  out  of  the  Middle  East,  the  primary  source  of  cheap 
crude oil, and other important producing areas, such as Venezuela. 

OPEC member states came to control their own supply of oil, and spent the next 
twenty  years  trying  to  engineer  higher  oil  prices.  Successful  at  first  (the  first  and 
second oil shocks of the 1970s), they later failed as many new areas (the North Sea, 
Gulf  of  Mexico,  Alaska’s  North  Slope,  and  West  Africa,  notably)  produced  substan-
tial  quantities  of  oil  and  most  developing  countries  introduced  conservation  meas-
ures.  The  oil  markets  crashed  and  consumers  and  their  governments  were  lulled 
into  a  feeling  of  complacency—i.e.,  excess  production  capacity  and  competition 
among suppliers driving prices down. 

But this era has now come to an end—non-OPEC countries are nearly tapped out. 
International  oil  companies  are  finding  fewer  new  places  to  look  for  oil,  and  there 
is  less  oil  in  those  areas  that  are  not  controlled  by  national  oil  companies.  Today 
NOCs  control  77  percent  of  the  world’s  oil  resources.  The  Majors  are  no  longer  the 
rulemakers—now they are rule-takers.

The  low  oil  prices  of  the  1980s  and  1990s  forced  oil  companies  to  become  more 
efficient users of capital. This process of financialization was driven by their share-
holders.  Capital  markets  are  ruthlessly  efficient.  They  demand  short-term  profits, 
delivered  quarterly.  Investors  punish  under-performing  companies,  and  companies 
will, thus, not invest in under-performing sectors. 

The  impact  on  the  industry  has  been  severe.  The  oil  and  gas  industry  is  a  risky, 
capital  intensive,  long-lead  time  business.  Many  oil  companies,  including  some  of 
the largest companies in the U.S.—Mobil, Amoco, Arco, and Texaco—could not com-
pete  effectively  and  went  out  of  business.  Likewise,  the  worst  performing  sector, 
downstream  received  less  investment  since  returns  were  lower.  The  companies  did 
not  ignore  their  refineries  and  marketing  operations,  spending  billions  to  upgrade 
and  de-bottleneck  for  efficiency  and  higher  fuel  standards,  but  they  did  not  invest 
in new refineries because they would be punished by investors, and an increasingly 
powerful environmental movement. Also, government regulations made construction 
of new refineries virtually impossible in the U.S. 

Major  oil  discoveries  were  made  in  the  1960s  and  1970s,  with  over  80  percent  of 
all global reserves (just over 2 trillion barrels) having been found before 1980. Since 
the  mid  1980s,  however,  discovery  sizes  had  clearly  begun  to  decline,  although  the 
exploration  efforts  of  the  industry  continued  aggressively  where  they  were  per-
mitted.  We  are  now  consuming  about  three  times  as  much  conventional  crude  oil 
as  we  are  discovering  through  exploration.  Even  counting  unconventional  oil,  nat-
ural  gas  liquids  and  enhanced  oil  recovery,  the  ratio  of  production  to  new  reserves 
is still greater than two-to-one. 

One  success  has  been  the  deep  offshore,  where  oil  is  produced  in  water  depths 
of  over  a  mile.  This  requires  tremendous  levels  of  technology  and  capital.  A  single 
field can cost over $3 billion to develop. The industry deserves credit for developing 
and producing so much oil in the areas where is does have access.

While the industry was struggling with reserve replacement, low prices, and polit-
ical barriers, consumers in America happily guzzled cheap gasoline. This was an ex-
plosive combination. Consumers benefited from a 58 percent decline in real gasoline 
prices  from  a  peak  1981,  to  the  low  point  in  1998.  Americans  became  richer  and 
spent  an  ever  smaller  percentage  of  their  growing  incomes  on  energy,  driving  more 
and more. Gasoline consumption in the U.S. rose 38 percent from 1981 to 2004. 

The  expansion  of  suburbia,  and  now  exurbia,  on  the  back  of  cheap  gasoline,  land 
and  credit  became  the  crucial  social  phenomenon  of  the  last  20  years.  This  is  sym-
bolized  by  Americans  driving  the  world’s  largest  SUVs  to  Wal-Mart,  the  world’s 
largest company. 

At the same time, across the Pacific, an economic giant has begun to stir. By the 
early  1990s,  the  Chinese  economy  began  to  become  market-based,  organized  for  ex-
ports. The Chinese economy began expanding, wealth was created, and expectations 
soared. Its demand for oil started growing just as its oil production began to mature. 
Market  experts,  ourselves  included,  were  slow  to  recognize  China’s  rocketing  de-
mand,  in  part  because  of  inadequate  data.  The  oil  markets  were  shocked  in  2003, 
when  Chinese  oil  consumption  leapt  by  11  percent,  and  again  in  2004,  by  18  per-
cent.

In  the  Autumn  of  2005,  the  world  economy  is  confronted  with  surging  demand 
and low supply growth. Refining capacity is tight. The international petroleum sys-
tem  produces  about  84  million  barrels  of  oil  per  day  (b/d),  with  very  little  excess 
capacity  to  provide  a  cushion  from  shocks,  such  as  Katrina  or  insurgency  in  Iraq. 
Any spare oil production capacity we have is in the Persian Gulf, particularly Saudi 
Arabia.

But  wait,  the  longer-term  the  picture  is  even  bleaker.  PFC  Energy  projects  that 
the  world  petroleum  system  can  generate  peak  production  of  95  to  100  million  b/ 
d by 2015–2020. Beyond that period, the industry will not be able raise output sig-
nificantly,  and  we  are  likely  to  see  a  plateauing  of  supplies  followed  by  a  slow  de-
cline.  Crude  oil  production  outside  of  Russia  and  OPEC  reached  a  plateau  in  1998, 
which persists to this day. Non-OPEC production will face serious growth challenges 
beyond  2010.  Beyond  2015,  OPEC  reserves  will  face  similar  growth  challenges.  To 
get to 100 million b/d, in spite of shrinking discovery sizes, enhanced recovery tech-

ural gas liquids, gas to liquids and tar sands.

Certain  respected  experts  believe  that  Saudi  Arabia  will  not  be  able  to  increase 
its  output,  or  even  worse,  that  its  output  will  decline.  However,  we  think  there  is 
a reasonable probability that Saudi-sustained production can increase from about 10 
million  b/d  now  to  12.5  million  b/d,  with  a  surge  capacity  of  another  2  million  b/ 
d.  The  Saudis  are  committed  to  spending  nearly  $50  billion  to  help  meet  rising  de-
mand for crude oil. When it comes to oil, Saudi Arabia has been a part of the solu-
tion,  not  the  problem.  Saudi  Aramco,  the  NOC,  is  highly  professional,  and  the 
Saudis  have  played  the  role  of  central  banker  for  oil,  seeking  to  provide  liquidity 
and stability to the market. 

There  is  not  very  much  that  can  be  done  to  increase  supply.  Some  optimists  say 
that  we  have  always  found  technical  solutions  to  increase  production  before,  and 
will  again.  Our  response  is  that  if  breakthrough  technology  is  not  in  the  pipeline 
now, it will have no impact for years. Likewise, the fact the NOCs control 77 percent 
of  the  oil  resources  means  that  the  ability  of  international  companies  is  seriously 
constrained, since they cannot get access to those resources. With high prices, how-
ever, many oil producing countries cannot absorb the money they are already receiv-
ing, and have little incentive to expand production. 

PFC  Energy’s  model  of  all  planned  projects  over  the  next  5  years  indicates  that 
there  is  still  some  breathing  room  in  the  near  term.  By  2010,  there  may  again  be 
some  excess  oil  production  capacity  in  the  global  industry.  While  this  may  buy  us 
some extra time to confront the future crisis, it is crucial that we not be lulled into 
a false sense of energy security. Most of the new production, expected by 2010, will 
come  from  the  former  Soviet  Union,  West  Africa  and  the  Middle  East,  much  of  it 
flowing to Asia.

Welcome  to  the  Age  of  Energy  Insecurity.  Worldwide  production  will  peak.  The 
result will be skyrocketing prices, with a huge, sustained economic shock. Jobs will 
be  lost.  Key  sectors  of  the  economy,  from  agriculture  to  home  building,  will  be  hit 
hard.  Without  action,  the  crisis  will  certainly  bring  energy  rivalries,  if  not  energy 
wars. Vast wealth will be shifted, probably away from the U.S. 

We must confront the issue of demand, primarily in the U.S. and Asia. Politicians 
in the U.S., from both sides of the aisle and both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, are 
loathe to come between Americans and their cars—part status symbol, part toy, part 
necessity.  Solutions  must  be  found,  but  if  the  wrong  solutions  are  proposed,  the

economy  as  a  whole,  and  the  suburban  economic  model  in  particular—the  basis  of 
the  American  consumers’  wealth—will  come  to  a  screeching  halt.  The  key  is  to  en-
gage critical stakeholders to come together and push for the political will for change. 
For the last 20 years, U.S. policy has discouraged production and encouraged con-
sumption.  This  policy  is  simply  not  sustainable.  If  we  dither  any  more,  as  we  have 
for so long, we will pay a terrible price, the economic equivalent of a Category Five 
hurricane. Katrina was a Category Four. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Our  next  witness,  as  I  said,  is  Mr.  Bustnes,  from  the  Rocky 

Mountain Institute. We would welcome your contribution today. 
STATEMENT OF ODD–EVEN BUSTNES, CONSULTANT, ENERGY 
AND RESOURCES SERVICES, ROCKY MOUNTAIN INSTITUTE 
Mr. BUSTNES. Good morning, Mr. Chairman. 
On  behalf  of  Rocky  Mountain  Institute,  I  appreciate  this  oppor-
tunity  to  testify  before  your  Committee  hearing,  to  examine  the 
rise of domestic energy prices. 

My  name  is  Odd-Even  Bustnes,  and  I’m  a  Manager  at  the  Insti-
tute.  My  background  is  in  economics  and  in  chemical  engineering. 
I was previously a consultant with McKinsey & Company, and I’m 
now at the Institute, consulting for the energy industry. 

My  testimony  will  focus  on  what  actions  can  be  taken  to  profit-
ably  lower  the  U.S.  oil  consumption.  My  testimony  will  highlight 
the  key  findings  of  our  major  independent  study,  ‘‘Winning  the  Oil 
Endgame:  Innovation  for  Profits,  Jobs,  and  Security’’—here  it  is— 
which was co-sponsored, by the way, by the Office of the Secretary 
of Defense. 

The  objective  of  this  two-year  research  effort  was  to  define  the 
proven  technologies  that  either  exist  today  or  are  being  commer-
cialized,  and  that  could  significantly  reduce  U.S.  oil  demand  and 
the  measures  necessary  to  accelerate  market  adoption.  Our  study 
is  built  around  competitive  strategy  business  cases  for  the  car, 
truck, plane, oil, and agriculture industries, and improving military 
effectiveness  through  efficiency.  Its  reception  by  those  civilian  and 
military  sectors  has  been  encouraging.  We  are  honored  that  the 
book’s Forewords by Secretary George Schultz and the former Shell 
Chairman, Sir Mark Moody-Stuart. 

Our analysis found that the United States of America can signifi-
cantly  reduce  its  use  of  oil  within  two  decades,  virtually  eliminate 
its use by the 2040s and, in the process, revitalize its economy, all 
led  by  business-for-profit.  The  profits  arise  because,  over  the  next 
few  decades,  the  best  technologies  already  in  or  entering  commer-
cial  service  in  Spring  of  2004,  can  save  or  displace  most  of  the  oil 
we use at a lower cost than buying it. This is true even if the world 
oil  price  fell  back  to  $26  a  barrel,  which  was  EIA’s  January  2004 
reference  case  forecast  for  the  year  2025.  And  it’s  also  true  if 
externalities were worth zero, as our analysis assumed. 

So, the broad outlines of a national path, beyond oil, are actually 
strikingly  simple,  and  it  contains  three  key  steps.  First,  redouble 
the efficiency of using the oil. Second, replace a third of remaining 
U.S.  oil  with  advanced  biofuels.  And,  finally,  save  half  of  natural 
gas  at  an  eighth  of  today’s  market  price,  and  then  substitute  the 
saved gas for the rest of the oil—optionally, if you will—via hydro-
gen over the long run. We found that half of the projected 2025 oil 
consumption  can  be  saved  by  more  efficient  use,  costing,  on  aver-

age,  $12  a  barrel.  The  other  half  can  be  replaced  by  cost-effective 
saved-natural-gas and advanced biofuels, costing less than $26 per 
marginal  barrel.  By  2025,  these  cheaper  savings  and  substitutions 
would cost less than $26 per barrel of oil and would save the coun-
try $155 billion per year gross, or $70 billion per year net. Achiev-
ing  this  transition  beyond  oil  would  require  investments,  about 
$180  billion  over  a  period  of  10  years.  Half  of  that  would  go  to  re-
tooling  the  car,  truck,  and  plane  industries,  and  half  to  build  the 
advanced biofuels industry. 

These  investments  would  also  create  a  million  new  jobs,  three- 
fourths of them in rural and small-town America, and could protect 
another million jobs now at risk in automotive and truck manufac-
turing. 

Two  technological  shifts  underpin  these  remarkable  findings— 
advanced materials and cellulose-based biofuels—both of which are 
proven  and  now  in  the  pre-commercial  stage.  We  do  not  need  to 
wait  for  the  fuel  cell.  Efficiency  and  biofuels  can  ultimately  halve 
our projected consumption of oil and bring us back to the pre-1970 
usage levels. 

As  a  free  by-product  of  the  profitable  oil  savings,  America’s  CO2 
emissions  would  decrease  by  26  percent.  These  outcomes  all  as-
sume the same doubled economy, the same mobility and vehicle at-
tributes,  and  the  same  lifestyles  as  EIA’s  2004  reference-case  fore-
cast,  but  would  yield  stronger  national  competitiveness,  a  more  vi-
brant  economy,  and  more  robust  security.  Our  analysis  details  the 
technologies, economics, and business logic of how to get the Nation 
off  oil  at  a  profit,  but  also  describes  innovative  policies  that  sup-
port,  not  distort,  business  logic,  based  on  the  sound  tenets  of  mar-
ket  economics  and  free  enterprise.  These  policies  do  not  require 
fuel  taxes,  subsidies,  mandates,  or  new  Federal  laws,  but  simply 
steer the relevant product markets in a direction that removes four 
key  market  barriers  that  prevent  efficiency  from  competing  on  a 
level playing field with supply today. 

I’ll  submit,  for  the  record,  an  executive  summary  of  our  findings 
and  a  few  comments  by  third  parties.  Let  me  just  quickly,  here, 
highlight the five most important points. 

First, with technology available today, we can halve our demand 
for  oil  within  three  decades,  possibly  two.  Saving  each  barrel  will, 
on  average,  cost  only  $12,  less  than  half  of  what  the  government, 
in  2004,  forecast  oil  will  cost  in  2025,  or  less  than  one-fifth  of  re-
cent prices. We conservatively excluded all external costs from this 
estimate, and assumed uncompromised performance and attributes 
of  vehicles.  The  technologies  that  make  this  possible  are  basically 
lighter  and  safer  vehicles  and  better  aerodynamics,  lower  rolling 
resistance,  and  hybrid  powertrains.  All  these  technologies  were 
commercially available last year, in 2004. 

Second, after halving its use of oil, the U.S. can displace the rest 
from  other 
fuels,  primarily  saved-natural-gas  and  advanced 
biofuels.  Of  the  remaining  demand,  one-third  can  be  replaced  with 
modern  biofuels.  These  are  not  fuels,  such  as  ethanol,  made  from 
heavily  subsidized  corn,  but,  rather,  from  woody  plants,  like 
switchgrass  and  poplar  trees.  These  feedstocks  double  the  yield 
while  saving  capital  and  energy.  Without  competing  for  food  crops’ 
land or water, such cellulosic ethanol, plus biodiesel, can cost-effec-

26 

tively  displace  some  four  million  barrels  of  oil  per  day,  create 
750,000 rural jobs, and boost farm income by tens of billions of dol-
lars per year. 

Third,  in  the  long  run,  by  saving  half  of  natural  gas  at  a  cost  of 
one-eighth  of  today’s  market  price  through  efficiency,  we  can  free- 
up gas to displace the remaining oil either directly or optionally via 
hydrogen in fuel-cell vehicles. 

Fourth,  the  fight  to  win  the  oil  endgame  is  about  national  secu-
rity  through  national  competitiveness.  We  need  to  invest  in  our 
core  automotive  industries,  to  retool  them  to  make  the  more  effi-
cient,  yet  safer,  spacious  cars  and  trucks  that  Americans  want  to 
buy.  We  need  to  invest  in  a  secure  domestic-fuels  infrastructure. 
These  investments  will  yield  cheaper  trucking  with  doubled  mar-
gins,  affordable  petrochemical  feed  stocks  and  airline  fuel,  lower 
and  more  stable  fuel  prices  for  all,  and  restored  American  leader-
ship in making cars, trucks, and planes. 

Fifth, and final point, to accelerate this adoption, our study sug-
gested  modest  policy  innovations  that  are  market-oriented  without 
taxes, innovation-driven without mandates, and doable administra-
tively.  Over  the  long-term,  the  Federal  policy  portfolio  should  be 
consistent, and it should seek to increase consumer adoption of effi-
cient  vehicles,  while  also  increasing  customer  choice  with  size  and 
class-based  feebates.  This  instrument  combines  fees  on  inefficient 
models  with  rebates  on  efficient  ones,  all  calculated  separately 
within  each  size  class,  so  one  isn’t  penalized  for  choosing  a  large 
vehicle,  but  rewarded  for  choosing  an  efficient,  large  vehicle.  This 
pulls  innovations  faster  from  the  lab  to  the  showrooms,  because  it 
encourages  buyer  investment  that  incorporates  the  value  of  fuel 
savings  over  the  entire  life  of  the  vehicle,  not  just  for  the  first  2 
to 3 years, which is common today. It basically matches, therefore, 
the societal and individual discount rates and deals with the infor-
mation challenge, both at the same time. 

In addition to this policy instrument, our report also outlines, in 
great detail, six other modest policy options that would enable effi-
ciency to fully compete in the market. And I can talk to you about 
those afterwards, if you want. 

In conclusion, many more jobs, dollars, and security gains would 
be  created  by  policies  that  steer  the  market  toward  the  more  af-
fordable  alternatives  to  oil,  such  as  efficient  technologies  and  new 
fuels.  The  reduction  in  demand  is  the  single-greatest  lever  we  can 
pull  to  permanently  lower  oil  prices.  We  achieved  this  in  our  his-
tory, between 1977 and 1985; when the U.S. GDP grew 27 percent, 
oil-use fell 17 percent. That very move broke OPEC’s pricing power 
for nearly a decade. Let’s work together to do it again. 

Mr. Chairman, thank you for listening to my testimony.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ODD-EVEN BUSTNES, CONSULTANT, ENERGY AND

Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman.  On  behalf  of  Rocky  Mountain  Institute,  I  appre-
ciate the opportunity to testify before your Committee hearing to ‘‘examine the rise 
of  domestic  energy  prices.’’  My  name  is  Odd-Even  Bustnes  and  I  am  a  Manager  at 
the  Institute.  I  hold  graduate  degrees  in  economics  and  in  chemical  engineering 
from Princeton and Oxford, and was previously a consultant with McKinsey & Com-

center  in  Old  Snowmass,  Colorado,  and  has  a  long  history  of  expertise  in  energy 
strategy and policy. 

RMI’s  testimony  will  focus  on  what  actions  can  be  taken  to  profitably  lower  U.S. 
oil  consumption.  My  testimony  will  highlight  the  key  findings  of  our  major  inde-
pendent study, Winning the Oil Endgame: Innovation for Profits, Jobs, and Security, 
which  was  co-sponsored  by  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense.  The  objective  of 
this two-year research effort was to define the proven technologies that either exist 
today,  or  are  being  commercialized,  and  that  could  significantly  reduce  U.S.  oil  de-
mand, and the measures necessary to accelerate market adoption. Our study is built 
around  competitive-strategy  business  cases  for  the  car,  truck,  plane,  oil,  and  agri-
culture industries, and improving military effectiveness through efficiency. Its recep-
tion  by  those  civilian  and  military  sectors  has  been  encouraging.  We  are  honored 
that  the  book’s  Forewords  are  by  Secretary  George  Shultz  and  the  former  Shell 
Chairman, Sir Mark Moody-Stuart. 

My  two  senior  co-authors,  RMI’s  CEO  Amory  Lovins  and  Senior  Director  Kyle 
Datta,  unfortunately  could  not  attend  today  on  such  short  notice,  but  they  hope  to 
be  of  service  on  another  occasion.  They  each  have  decades  of  experience  in  energy 
policy.  I  do  not.  My  role  in  our  study  was  chiefly  performing  technological  and  eco-
nomic  analyses.  I  will,  therefore,  defer  broad  policy  questions  to  my  senior  col-
leagues  for  their  written  response.  However,  I  am  happy  this  morning  to  give  you 
an overview of our findings, and hope these will be of interest and value. 

Our analysis found that the United States of America can significantly reduce its 
use  of  oil  within  two  decades,  virtually  eliminate  its  oil  use  by  the  2040s,  and  in 
the process revitalize its economy, all led by business-for-profit. The profits arise be-
cause  over  the  next  few  decades,  the  best  technologies  already  in,  or  entering  com-
mercial  service  in  Spring  2004,  can  save  or  displace  most  of  the  oil  we  use,  at  a 
lower  cost  than  buying  it.  This  is  true  even  if  the  world  oil  price  fell  back  to  $26 
a barrel (in year-2000 dollars)—which was EIA’s January 2004 Reference Case fore-
cast  for  the  year  2025—and  also  if  externalities  were  worth  zero,  as  our  analysis 
assumed. 

The broad outlines of a national path beyond oil are strikingly simple, and it con-

tains three steps. 

1. First, redouble the efficiency of using oil. 
2. Second, replace a third of remaining U.S. oil with advanced biofuels. 
3.  Finally,  save  half  of  natural  gas  at  an  eighth  of  today’s  market  price,  and 
then  substitute  the  saved  gas  for  the  rest  of  the  oil  via  hydrogen  over  the  long 
run. 

We  found  that  half  of  the  projected  2025  oil  consumption  can  be  saved  by  more 
efficient  use,  costing  on  average  $12/bbl.  The  other  half  can  be  replaced  by  cost-ef-
fective  saved-natural-gas  and  advanced  biofuels  costing  less  than  $26  per  marginal 
barrel.  By  2025,  these  cheaper  savings  and  substitutions  would  cost  less  than  $26/ 
bbl oil, and would save $155 billion per year gross, or $70 billion a year net. Achiev-
ing  this  transition  beyond  oil  would  require  a  $180  billion  investment  over  10 
years—half  to  retool  the  car,  truck,  and  plane  industries,  and  half  to  build  the  ad-
vanced biofuels industry. These investments would also create a million new jobs— 
three-fourths  of  them  in  rural  and  small-town  America—and  could  protect  another 
million jobs now at risk in automotive and truck manufacturing. 

Two  technological  breakthroughs  underpin  these  remarkable  findings:  advanced 
materials  and  cellulose-based  biofuels,  both  of  which  are  proven,  and  now  in  the 
pre-commercial stage. We do not need to wait for the fuel cell; efficiency and biofuels 
can ultimately halve our projected consumption of oil, and bring us back to pre-1970 
usage  levels.  As  a  free  byproduct  of  the  profitable  oil  savings,  America’s  CO2 emis-
sions  would  decrease  by  26  percent.  These  outcomes  all  assume  the  same  doubled 
economy, the same mobility and vehicle attributes, and the same lifestyles as EIA’s 
2004  Reference  Case  forecast,  but  would  yield  stronger  competitiveness,  a  more  vi-
brant economy, and more robust security. 

Our analysis details the technologies, economics, and business logic of how to get 
the Nation off oil at a profit, but also describes innovative policies that support, not 
distort,  business  logic  based  on  the  sound  tenets  of  market  economics  and  free  en-
terprise.  These  policies  do  not  require  fuel  taxes,  subsidies,  mandates,  or  new  Fed-
eral laws, but simply steer the relevant product markets in a direction that removes 
four  key  market  barriers  that  prevent  efficiency  from  competing  on  a  level  playing 
field with supply. 

I’ll  submit  for  the  record  an  Executive  Summary  of  our  findings  and  a  few  com-
ments  by  third  parties.  The  complete  analysis  is  very  detailed  and  integrative,  but 
let me highlight here the five most important points:

1. First, with technology available today we can halve our demand for oil within 
three decades. Saving each barrel will on average cost only $12—less than half 
what  the  government  in  2004  forecast  oil  will  cost  in  2025,  or  less  than  one- 
fifth of recent prices. We conservatively excluded all external costs from this es-
timate,  and  assumed  uncompromised  performance  and  attributes  of  vehicles. 
The technologies that make this possible are lighter and safer materials, better 
aerodynamics,  lower  rolling  resistance,  and  hybrid  powertrains.  All  these  tech-
nologies were commercially available in 2004. 
2. Second, after halving its use of oil, the U.S. can displace the rest from other 
fuels,  primarily  saved-natural-gas  and  advanced  biofuels.  Of  the  remaining  de-
mand, one-third can be replaced with modern biofuels. These are not fuels such 
as ethanol made from heavily subsidized corn, but rather from woody plants like 
switchgrass  and  poplar  trees.  These  feedstocks  double  the  yield  while  saving 
capital and energy. Without competing for food crops’ land or water, such ‘‘cellu-
losic ethanol,’’ plus biodiesel, can cost-effectively displace some four million bar-
rels  of  oil  per  day,  create  750,000  rural  jobs,  and  boost  farm  income  by  tens  of 
billions of dollars per year. 
3.  Third,  in  the  long  run,  by  saving  half  of  natural  gas  at  a  cost  of  one-eighth 
of  today’s  market  price  through  efficiency  can  free  up  gas  to  displace  the  re-
maining oil either directly or via hydrogen in fuel-cell vehicles. 
4.  Fourth,  the  fight  to  win  the  oil  endgame  is  about  national  security  through 
national  competitiveness.  We  need  to  invest  in  our  core  automotive  industries 
to  retool  them  to  make  them  more  efficient—yet  safer,  spacious,  and  sporty— 
cars and trucks that Americans want to buy. We need to invest in a secure do-
mestic  fuels  infrastructure.  These  investments  will  yield  cheaper  trucking  with 
doubled margins, affordable petrochemical feedstocks and airline fuel, lower and 
more  stable  fuel  prices  for  all,  and  restored  American  leadership  in  making 
cars, trucks, and planes. 
5. Fifth, to accelerate adoption, our study, therefore, suggested modest policy in-
novations  that  are  market-oriented  without  taxes,  innovation-driven  without 
mandates,  and  doable  administratively.  Over  the  long-term,  the  Federal  policy 
portfolio should be consistent, and it should seek to increase consumer adoption 
of  efficient  vehicles  while  also  increasing  customer  choice  with  size-  and  class- 
based  feebates.  This  instrument  combines  fees  on  inefficient  models  with  re-
bates  on  efficient  ones—all  calculated  separately  within  each  size  class,  so  one 
isn’t  penalized  for  choosing  a  large  vehicle,  but  rewarded  for  choosing  an  effi-
cient, large vehicle. This pulls innovations faster from the lab to the showrooms 
because it encourages buyer investment that incorporates the value of fuel sav-
ings  over  the  entire  life  of  the  vehicle,  not  just  for  the  first  2–3  years.  It  basi-
cally  matches  the  societal  and  individual  discount  rates  and  deals  with  the  in-
formation challenge at the same time. 
In  addition  to  this  policy  instrument,  our  report  also  outlines,  in  great  detail, 
six  other  modest  policy  options  that  would  enable  efficiency  to  fully  compete  in 
the market. 

In  conclusion,  many  more  jobs,  dollars,  and  security  gains  would  be  created  by 
policies  that  steer  the  market  toward  the  more  affordable  alternatives  to  oil,  such 
as efficient technologies and new fuels. The reduction in demand is the single great-
est  lever  we  can  pull  to  permanently  lower  oil  prices.  We  achieved  this  between 
1977  and  1985,  when  U.S.  GDP  grew  27  percent,  but  oil  use  fell  17  percent.  That 
broke  OPEC’s  pricing  power  for  nearly  a  decade.  Lets  work  together  to  do  it  again. 

Mr. Chairman, thank you for listening to my testimony. 

FOREWORD TO Winning the Oil Endgame by George P. Schultz 

Crude  prices  are  rising,  uncertainty  about  developments  in  the  Middle  East  roils 
markets and, well, as Ronald Reagan might say, ‘‘Here we go again.’’ Once more we 
face  the  vulnerability  of  our  oil  supply  to  political  disturbances.  Three  times  in  the 
past thirty years (1973, 1978, and 1990) oil price spikes caused by Middle East cri-
ses  helped  throw  the  U.S.  economy  into  recession.  Coincident  disruption  in  Ven-
ezuela and Russia adds to unease, let alone prices, in 2004. And the surging econo-
mies  of  China  and  India  are  contributing  significantly  to  demand.  But  the  problem 
far transcends economics and involves our national security. How many more times 
must we be hit on the head by a two-by-four before we do something decisive about 
this acute problem?

In 1969, when I was Secretary of Labor, President Nixon made me the Chairman 
of a Cabinet Task Force to examine the oil import quota system, in place since 1954. 
Back  then,  President  Eisenhower  considered  too  much  dependence  on  imported  oil 
to be a threat to national security. He thought anything over 20 percent was a real 
problem.  No  doubt  he  was  nudged  by  his  friends  in  the  Texas  and  Louisiana  oil 
patches,  but  Ike  was  no  stranger  to  issues  of  national  security  and  foreign  policy. 
The Task Force was not prescient or unanimous but, smelling trouble, the major-
ity could see that imports would rise and they recommended a new monitoring sys-
tem to keep track of the many uncertainties we could see ahead, and a new system 
for  regulating  imports.  Advocates  for  even  greater  restrictions  on  imports  argued 
that low-cost oil from the Middle East would flood our market if not restricted. 

By  now,  the  quota  argument  has  been  stood  on  its  head  as  imports  make  up  an 
increasing  majority,  now  almost  60  percent  and  heading  higher,  of  the  oil  we  con-
sume. And we worry, not about issues of letting imports in, but that they might be 
cut off. Nevertheless, the point about the importance of relative cost is as pertinent 
today  as  back  then  and  applies  to  the  competitive  pressures  on  any  alternative  to 
oil. And the low-cost producers of oil are almost all in the Middle East. 

That  is  an  area  where  the  population  is  exploding  out  of  control,  where  youth  is 
by far the largest group, and where these young people have little or nothing to do. 
The  reason  is  that  governance  in  these  areas  has  failed  them.  In  many  countries, 
oil has produced wealth without the effort that connects people to reality, a problem 
reinforced  in  some  of  them  by  the  fact  that  the  hard  physical  work  is  often  done 
by  imported  labor.  The  submissive  role  forced  on  women  has  led  to  this  population 
explosion.  A  disproportionate  share  of  the  world’s  many  violent  conflicts  is  in  this 
area. So the Middle East remains one of the most unstable parts of the world. Only 
a  dedicated  optimist  could  believe  that  this  assessment  will  change  sharply  in  the 
near  future.  What  would  be  the  impact  on  the  world  economy  of  terrorist  sabotage 
of key elements of the Saudi pipeline infrastructure? 

I believe that, three decades after the Nixon task force effort, it is long past time 
to take serious steps to alter this picture dramatically. Yes, important progress has 
been  made,  with  each  Administration  announcing  initiatives  to  move  us  away  from 
oil.  Advances  in  technology  and  switches  from  oil  to  natural  gas  and  coal  have 
caused  our  oil  use  per  dollar  of  GDP,  to  fall  in  half  since  1973.  That  helps  reduce 
the  potential  damage  from  supply  problems.  But  potential  damage  is  increased  by 
the  rise  of  imports  from  28  percent  to  almost  60  percent  of  all  the  oil  we  use.  The 
big  growth  sector  is  transportation,  up  by  50  percent.  Present  trends  are  unfavor-
able;  if  continued,  they  mean  that  we  are  likely  to  consume—and  import—several 
million barrels a day more by 2010. 

Beyond  U.S.  consumption,  supply-and-demand  in  the  world’s  oil  market  has  be-
come tight again, leading to many new possibilities of soaring oil prices and massive 
macroeconomic losses from oil disruptions. We also have environmental problems to 
concern  us.  And,  most  significantly,  our  national  security,  and  its  supporting  diplo-
macy, are left vulnerable to fears of major disruptions in the market for oil, let alone 
the  reality  of  sharp  price  spikes.  These  costs  are  not  reflected  in  the  market  price 
of oil, but they are substantial. 

What  more  can  we  do?  Lots,  if  we  are  ready  for  a  real  effort.  I  remember  when, 
as  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  I  reviewed  proposals  for  alternatives  to  oil  from  the 
time of the first big oil crisis in 1973. Pie in the sky, I thought. But now the situa-
tion is different. We can, as Amory Lovins and his colleagues show vividly, win the 
oil endgame. How do we go about this? 

A  baseball  analogy  may  be  applicable.  Fans  often  have  the  image  in  their  minds 
of a big hitter coming up with the bases loaded, two outs, and the home team three 
runs  behind.  The  big  hitter  wins  the  game  with  a  home  run.  We  are  addicted  to 
home runs, but the outcome of a baseball game is usually determined by a combina-
tion of walks, stolen bases, errors, hit batsmen, and, yes, some doubles, triples, and 
home  runs.  There’s  also  good  pitching  and  solid  fielding,  so  ball  games  are  won  by 
a  wide  array  of  events,  each  contributing  to  the  result.  Lovins  and  his  co-authors 
show  us  that  the  same  approach  can  work  in  winning  the  oil  endgame.  There  are 
some  potential  big  hits  here,  but  the  big  point  is  that  there  are  a  great  variety  of 
measures  that  can  be  taken  that  each  will  contribute  to  the  end  result.  The  point 
is to muster the will-power and drive to pursue these possibilities. 

How do we bring that about? Let’s not wait for a catastrophe to do the job. Com-
petitive information is key. Our marketplace is finely tuned to the desire of the con-
sumer  to  have  real  choices.  We  live  in  a  real  information  age,  so  producers  have 
to  be  ready  for  the  competition  that  can  come  out  of  nowhere.  Lovins  and  his  col-
leagues  provide  a  huge  amount  of  information  about  potential  competitive  ap-
proaches. There are home run balls here, the ultimate one being the hydrogen econ-
omy.  But  we  don’t  have  to  wait  for  the  arrival  of  that  day.  There  are  many  things

that  can  be  done  now,  and  this  book  is  full  of  them.  Hybrid  technology  is  on  the 
road, and currently increases gas mileage by 50 percent or more. The technology is 
scaleable.  This  report  suggests  many  ways  to  reduce  weight  and  drag,  thereby  im-
proving performance. A big point in this report is evidence that new, ultralight-but- 
safe materials can nearly redouble fuel economy at little or no extra cost. 

Sequestration  of  effluent  from  use  of  coal  may  be  possible  on  an  economic  and 
comfortable  basis,  making  coal  a  potentially  benign  source  of  hydrogen.  Maybe  hy-
drogen could be economically split out of water by electrolysis, perhaps using renew-
ables  such  as  windpower;  or  it  could  certainly  be  made,  as  nearly  all  of  it  is  now, 
by natural gas saved from currently wasteful practices, an intriguingly lucrative op-
tion,  often  overlooked  in  discussions  of  today’s  gas  shortages.  An  economy  with  a 
major hydrogen component would do wonders for both our security and our environ-
ment.  With  evident  improvements  in  fuel  cells,  that  combination  could  amount  to 
a  very  big  deal.  Applications  include  stationary  as  well  as  mobile  possibilities,  and 
other ideas are in the air. Real progress has been made in the use of solar systems 
for  heat  and  electricity.  Scientists,  technologists,  and  commercial  organizations  in 
many countries are hard at work on these issues. 

Sometimes  the  best  way  to  get  points  across  is  to  be  provocative,  to  be  a  bull  in 
a  china  closet.  Amory  Lovins  loves  to  be  a  bull  in  a  china  closet—anybody’s  china 
closet. With this book, the china closet he’s bursting into is ours, and we should wel-
come  him  because  he  is  showing  us  how  to  put  the  closet  back  together  again  in 
far  more  satisfactory  form.  In  fact,  Lovins  and  his  team  make  an  intriguing  case 
that is important enough to merit careful attention by all of us, private citizens, and 
business and political leaders alike.

FOREWORD TO Winning the Oil Endgame by Sir Mark Moody-Stuart 

In this compelling synthesis, Amory Lovins and his colleagues at Rocky Mountain 
Institute provide a clear and penetrating view of one of the critical challenges facing 
the world today: the use of energy, especially oil, in transportation, industry, build-
ings,  and  the  military.  This  report  demonstrates  that  innovative  technologies  can 
achieve spectacular savings in all of these areas with no loss of utility, convenience, 
and function. It makes the business case for how a profitable transition for the auto-
motive,  truck,  aviation,  and  oil  sectors  can  be  achieved,  and  why  they  should  em-
brace  technological  innovation  rather  than  be  destroyed  by  it.  We  are  not  short  of 
energy in this world of ours; we have large resources of the convenient hydrocarbons 
on which our economies are based, and even greater resources of the coal on which 
our economies were originally built. But there are two serious issues relating to its 
supply and use. 

First, some three-fourths of the reserves sit in a few countries of the Middle East, 
subject to actual and potential political turmoil. Second, there are the long-term cli-
matic  effects  of  the  burning  of  increasing  amounts  of  fossil  fuels.  While  the  normal 
rate  of  change  of  technology  is  likely  to  mean  that  we  will  be  on  one  of  the  lower 
impact scenarios of climate change, and not at the apocalyptic end favoured by doom 
mongers,  it  is  reasonably  certain  that  our  world  will  have  to  adapt  to  significant 
climate  change  over  the  next  century.  These  two  factors  mean  that,  unless  there  is 
a change of approach, the United States will inexorably become increasingly depend-
ent  on  imported  energy—be  it  oil  or  natural  gas.  At  the  same  time,  on  the  inter-
national scene, the United States will be criticised by the rest of the world for prof-
ligate use of energy, albeit to fuel an economy on whose dynamism and success the 
rest of the world is also manifestly dependent. Furthermore, thoughtful people won-
der  what  we  will  do  if  the  booming  economies  and  creative  people  of  China  and 
India have energy demands which are on the same development curve as the United 
States.

The  RMI  team  has  approached  this  economic  and  strategic  dilemma  with  tech-
nical  rigour,  good  humour,  and  common  sense,  while  addressing  two  key  require-
ments often overlooked by energy policy advocates. 

First, we have to deliver the utility, reliability and convenience that the consumer 
has  come  to  expect.  As  business  people  we  recognise  this.  It  is  no  good  expecting 
people  in  the  United  States  to  suddenly  drive  smaller,  less  convenient  or  less  safe 
vehicles. We have to supply the same comfort and utility at radically increased lev-
els  of  energy  efficiency.  Most  consumers,  who  are  also  voters,  have  only  a  limited 
philosophical  interest  in  energy  efficiency,  security  of  supply,  and  climate  change. 
Most of us have a very intense interest in personal convenience and safety—we ex-
pect  governments  and  business  to  handle  those  other  issues  on  our  behalf.  There 
is a very small market in this world for hair shirts. Similarly, we cannot expect the 
citizens of China and India to continue to ride bicycles in the interests of the global 
environment. They have exactly the same aspirations to comfort and convenience as 
we do. This book demonstrates how by applying existing technologies to lightweight 
vehicles with the use of composites, by the use of hybrid powertrains already in pro-
duction,  and  with  the  rapid  evolution  to  new  technologies,  we  can  deliver  the  high 
levels  of  convenience  and  reliability  we  are  used  to  at  radically  increased  levels  of 
energy efficiency, while also maintaining cost efficiency. 

The  second  critical  requirement  is  that  the  process  of  transition  should  be  fun-
damentally economic. We know in business that while one may be prepared to make 
limited  pathfinding  investments  at  nil  or  low  return  in  order  to  develop  new  prod-
ucts  and  markets,  this  can  not  be  done  at  a  larger  scale,  nor  indefinitely.  What  we 
can do, and have seen done repeatedly, is to transform markets by delivering great-
er  utility  at  the  same  cost  or  the  same  utility  at  a  lower  cost,  often  by  combining 
more  advanced  technologies  with  better  business  models.  When  this  happens,  the 
rate of change of markets normally exceeds our wildest forecasts and within a space 
of a few years a whole new technology has evolved. 

A good example of the rapid development and waning of technology is the fax ma-
chine.  With  astonishing  rapidity,  because  of  its  functional  advantages  over  surface 
mail,  the  fax  machine  became  globally  ubiquitous.  The  smallest  businesses  around 
the world had one and so did numerous homes. The fax has now become almost ob-
solete  because  of  e-mail,  the  e-mail  attachment  and  finally  the  scanned  e-mail  at-
tachment.  The  connectivity  of  the  Internet,  of  which  e-mail  is  an  example,  has 
transformed  the  way  we  do  business.  What  this  book  shows  is  that  the  delivery  of 
radically  more  energy-efficient  technologies  has  dramatic  cost  implications  and 
therefore has the potential for a similarly economically driven transition. 

The refreshingly creative government policies suggested here to smooth and speed 
that transition are a welcome departure from traditional approaches that often over-
look  or  even  reject  the  scope  of  enterprise  to  be  an  important  part  of  the  solution. 
These  innovative  policies,  too,  merit  serious  attention,  especially  as  an  integrated 
package, and I suspect they could win support across the political spectrum. 

The technological, let alone policy, revolution has not been quick in coming to the 
United  States.  Yet  as  has  happened  before  in  the  automobile  industry,  others  are 
aware of the potential of the technology. Perhaps because of Japan’s obsession with 
energy security, Toyota and Honda began some years ago to hone the electric-hybrid 
technology that is likely to be an important part of the energy efficiency revolution. 
As  a  result,  U.S.  automobile  manufacturers  who  now  see  the  market  opportunities 
of  these  technologies  are  turning  to  the  proven  Japanese  technology  to  deliver  it 
rapidly. 

I believe that we may see a similar leapfrogging of technology from China. China 
is  fully  aware  of  the  consequences  on  energy  demand,  energy  imports,  and  security 
of  supply  of  its  impressive  economic  growth.  Already  China  is  using  regulation  to 
channel  development  into  more  energy-efficient  forms.  The  burgeoning  Chinese 
automobile  industry  is  likely  to  be  guided  down  this  route—delivering  the  function 
and  convenience,  but  at  greatly  increased  levels  of  efficiency.  And  it  is  not  just  in 
the  automobile  industry—by  clearly  stated  national  policy  it  applies  to  all  areas  of 
industrial  activity.  This  has  great  implications  both  for  the  participation  by  U.S. 
firms  in  investment  in  China,  and  also  in  the  impact  of  future  Chinese  manufac-
tures on a global market that is likely to be paying much greater attention to energy 
efficiency. 

As  a  businessman,  I  am  attracted  by  the  commercial  logic  and  keen  insight  that 
this  report  brings  to  the  marketplace  struggle  between  oil  and  its  formidable  com-
petitors  on  both  the  demand  and  the  supply  sides.  Indeed,  during  my  time  in  both 
Shell  and  Anglo  American,  RMI’s  engineers  have  helped  ours  to  confirm  unexpect-
edly  rich  deposits  of  mineable  ‘‘negawatts’’  and  ‘‘negabarrels’’  in  our  own  oper-
ations—an exploration effort we’re keen to intensify to the benefit of both our share-
holders and the environment.

As  a  lifelong  oil  man  and  exploration  geologist,  I  am  especially  excited  to  learn 
about the Saudi Arabia-size riches that Amory Lovins and RMI’s explorers have dis-
covered in what they term the Detroit Formation—through breakthrough vehicle de-
sign  that  can  save  vast  amounts  of  oil  more  cheaply  than  it  can  be  supplied.  And 
as a citizen and grandparent, I am pleased that RMI proposes new business models 
to  span  the  mobility  divide  that  separates  rich  and  poor,  not  just  in  the  United 
States,  but  in  many  places  in  the  world.  Concern  about  such  opportunity  divides  is 
increasingly  at  the  core  not  just  of  international  morality  but  also  of  stability  and 
peace. 

This  book  points  the  way  to  an  economically  driven  energy  transformation.  And 
its  subtitle  ‘‘Innovation  for  Profit,  Jobs,  and  Security’’  is  both  a  prospectus  for  posi-
tive change and a reminder that both the United States and other countries can be 
rapid adapters of innovative technologies, with equally transformative economic con-
sequences. As someone who has spent a lifetime involved in energy and changes in 
energy  patterns,  I  find  the  choice  an  easy  one  to  make.  The  global  economy  is  very 
much  dependent  on  the  health  of  the  U.S.  economy,  so  I  hope  that  the  U.S.  indeed 
makes the right choice. 

This report will help to launch, inspire, and inform a new and necessary conversa-

tion about energy and security, economy and environment. 

Its outcome is vital for us all.

Executive Summary 

Winning  the  Oil  Endgame  offers  a  coherent  strategy  for  ending  oil  dependence, 
starting with the United States but applicable worldwide. There are many analyses 
of  the  oil  problem.  This  synthesis  is  the  first  roadmap  of  the  oil  solution—one  led 
by business-for-profit, not dictated by government for reasons of ideology. This road-
map  is  independent,  peer-reviewed,  written  for  business  and  military  leaders,  and 
co-funded  by  the  Pentagon.  It  combines  innovative  technologies  and  new  business 
models  with  uncommon  public  policies:  market-oriented  without  taxes,  innovation- 
driven  without  mandates,  not  dependent  on  major  (if  any)  national  legislation,  and 
designed to support, not distort, business logic. 

Two  centuries  ago,  the  first  industrial  revolution  made  people  a  hundred  times 
more productive, harnessed fossil energy for transport and production, and nurtured 
the young U.S. economy. Then, over the past 145 years, the Age of Oil brought un-
precedented  mobility,  globe-spanning  military  power,  and  amazing  synthetic  prod-
ucts. 

But at what cost? Oil, which created the sinews of our strength, is now becoming 
an  even  greater  source  of  weakness:  its  volatile  price  erodes  prosperity;  its 
vulnerabilities  undermine  security;  its  emissions  destabilize  climate.  Moreover  the 
quest  to  attain  oil  creates  dangerous  new  rivalries  and  tarnishes  America’s  moral 
standing.  All  these  costs  are  rising.  And  their  root  causes—most  of  all,  inefficient 
light  trucks  and  cars—also  threaten  the  competitiveness  of  U.S.  automaking  and 
other key industrial sectors. 

The  cornerstone  of  the  next  industrial  revolution  is  therefore  winning  the  Oil 
Endgame. And surprisingly, it will cost less to displace all of the oil that the United 
States  now  uses  than  it  will  cost  to  buy  that  oil.  Oil’s  current  market  price  leaves

out its true costs to the economy, national security, and the environment. But even 
without  including  these  now  ‘‘externalized’’  costs,  it  would  still  be  profitable  to  dis-
place oil completely over the next few decades. In fact, by 2025, the annual economic 
benefit  of  that  displacement  would  be  $130  billion  gross  (or  $70  billion  net  of  the 
displacement’s costs). To achieve this does not require a revolution, but merely con-
solidating  and  accelerating  trends  already  in  place:  the  amount  of  oil  the  economy 
uses for each dollar of GDP produced, and the fuel efficiency of light vehicles, would 
need  only  to  improve  about  three-fifths  as  quickly  as  they  did  in  response  to  pre-
vious oil shocks. 

Saving  half  the  oil  America  uses,  and  substituting  cheaper  alternatives  for  the 

other half, requires four integrated steps: 

• Double  the  efficiency  of  using  oil.  The  U.S.  today  wrings  twice  as  much  work 
from  each  barrel  of  oil  as  it  did  in  1975;  with  the  latest  proven  efficiency  tech-
nologies,  it  can  double  oil  efficiency  all  over  again.  The  investments  needed  to 
save each barrel of oil will cost only $12 (in 2000 $), less than half the officially 
forecast  $26  price  of  that  barrel  in  the  world  oil  market.  The  most  important 
enabling  technology  is  ultralight  vehicle  design.  Advanced  composite  or  light-
weight-steel  materials  can  nearly  double  the  efficiency  of  today’s  popular  hy-
brid-electric cars and light trucks while improving safety and performance. The 
vehicle’s  total  extra  cost  is  repaid  from  fuel  savings  in  about  3  years;  the 
ultralighting  is  approximately  free.  Through  emerging  manufacturing  tech-
niques,  such  vehicles  are  becoming  practical  and  profitable;  the  factories  to 
produce them will also be cheaper and smaller. 
• Apply creative business models and public policies to speed the profitable adop-
tion of superefficient light vehicles, heavy trucks, and airplanes. Combined with 
more efficient buildings and factories, these efficient vehicles can cut the official 
forecast  of  oil  use  by  29  percent  in  2025,  and  another  23  percent  soon  there-
after—52  percent  in  all.  Enabled  by  a  new  industrial  cluster  focusing  on  light-
weight materials, such as carbon-fiber composites, such advanced-technology ve-
hicles  can  revitalize  these  three  strategic  sectors  and  create  important  new  in-
dustries. 
• Provide another one-fourth of U.S. oil needs by a major domestic biofuels indus-
try.  Recent  advances  in  biotechnology  and  cellulose-to-ethanol  conversion  can 
double  previous  techniques’  yield,  yet  cost  less  in  both  capital  and  energy.  Re-
placing fossil-fuel hydrocarbons with plant-derived carbohydrates will strength-
en  rural  America,  boost  net  farm  income  by  tens  of  billions  of  dollars  a  year, 
and create more than 750,000 new jobs. Convergence between the energy, chem-
ical, and agricultural value chains will also let versatile new classes of biomate-
rials replace petrochemicals. 
• Use well-established, highly-profitable efficiency techniques to save half the pro-
jected  2025  use  of  natural  gas,  making  it  again  abundant  and  affordable,  then 
substitute  part  of  the  saved  gas  for  oil.  If  desired,  the  leftover  saved-natural- 
gas could be used even more profitably and effectively by converting it to hydro-
gen, displacing most of the remaining oil use—and all of the oil use if modestly 
augmented by competitive renewable energy. 

These  four  shifts  are  fundamentally  disruptive  to  current  business  models.  They 
are what economist Joseph Schumpeter called ‘‘creative destruction,’’ where innova-
tions  destroy  obsolete  technologies,  only  to  be  overthrown  in  turn  by  ever  newer, 
more  efficient  rivals.  In  The  Innovator’s  Dilemma,  Harvard  Business  School  Pro-
fessor, Clayton Christensen, explained why industry leaders often get blindsided by 
disruptive  innovations—technological  gamechangers—because  they  focus  too  much 
on  today’s  most  profitable  customers  and  businesses,  ignoring  the  needs  of  the  fu-
ture. Firms that are quick to adopt innovative technologies and business models will 
be  the  winners  of  the  21st  century;  those  that  deny  and  resist  change  will  join  the 
dead from the last millennium. In the 108-year history of the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average,  only  one  of  12  original  companies  remains  a  corporate  entity  today—Gen-
eral Electric. The others perished or became fodder for their competitors. 

What  policies  are  needed?  American  companies  can  be  among  the  quick  leaders 
in  the  21st  century,  but  it  will  take  a  cohesive  strategy-based  transformation,  bold 
business  and  military  leadership,  and  supportive  government  policies  at  a  Federal 
or  at  least  a  state  level.  Winning  the  Oil  Endgame  charts  these  practical  stepping-
stones to an oil-free America: 

• Most importantly, revenue- and size-neutral ‘‘feebates’’ can shift customer choice 
by  combining  fees  on  inefficient  vehicles  with  rebates  to  efficient  vehicles.  The 
feebates  apply  separately  within  each  vehicle-size  class,  so  freedom  of  choice  is 
unaffected.  Indeed,  choice  is  enhanced  as  customers  start  to  count  fuel  savings

Pentagon leadership in developing key technologies. 

over  the  vehicle’s  life,  not  just  the  first  few  years,  and  this  new  pattern  of  de-
mand  pulls  super-efficient,  but  uncompromised  vehicles,  from  the  drawing- 
board into the showroom. 
• A scrap-and-replace program can lease or sell super-efficient cars to low-income 
Americans—on  terms  and  with  fuel  bills  they  can  afford—while  scrapping 
clunkers. This makes personal mobility affordable to all, creates a new million- 
car-a-year market for the new efficiency technologies, and helps clean our cities’ 
air. 
• Military needs for agility, rapid deployment, and streamlined logistics can drive 
• Implementing  smart  government  procurement  and  targeted  technology  acquisi-
tion  (the  ‘‘Golden  Carrot’’)  for  aggregated  buyers  will  accelerate  manufacturers’ 
conversion,  while  a  government-sponsored  $1-billion  prize  for  success  in  the 
marketplace,  the  ‘‘Platinum  Carrot,’’  will  speed  development  of  even  more  ad-
vanced vehicles. 
• To  support  U.S.  automakers’  and  suppliers’  need  to  invest  about  $70  billion  to 
make  advanced  technology  vehicles,  Federal  loan  guarantees  can  help  finance 
initial retooling where needed; the investments should earn a handsome return, 
with big spin-off benefits. 
• Similar but simpler policies—loan guarantees for buying efficient new airplanes 
(while scrapping inefficient parked ones), and better information for heavy truck 
buyers  to  spur  market  demand  for  doubled-efficiency  trucks—can  speed  these 
oil-saving innovations from concept to market. 
• Other  policies  can  hasten  competitive  evolution  of  next-generation  biofuels  and 
biomaterials  industries,  substituting  durable  revenues  for  dwindling  agricul-
tural subsidies, and encouraging practices that protect both topsoil and climate. 
What happens to the oil industry? The transition beyond oil is already starting to 
transform  oil  companies  like  Shell  and  BP  into  energy  companies.  Done  right,  this 
shift  can  profitably  redeploy  their  skills  and  assets  rather  than  lose  market  share. 
Biofuels are already becoming a new product line that leverages existing retail and 
distribution  infrastructure  and  can  attract  another  $90  billion  in  biofuels  and  bio-
refining  investments.  By  following  this  roadmap,  the  U.S.  would  set  the  stage  by 
2025  for  the  checkmate  move  in  the  Oil  Endgame—the  optional  but  advantageous 
transition to a hydrogen economy and the complete and permanent displacement of 
oil  as  a  direct  fuel.  Oil  may,  however,  retain  or  even  gain  value  as  one  of  the  com-
peting sources of hydrogen. 

How  big  is  the  prize?  Investing  $180  billion  over  the  next  decade  to  eliminate  oil 
dependence  and  revitalize  strategic  industries  can  save  $130  billion  gross,  or  $70 
billion net, every year by 2025. This saving, equivalent to a large tax cut, can replace 
today’s  $10-billion-a-month  oil  imports  with  reinvestments  in  ourselves:  $40  billion 
would pay farmers for biofuels, while the rest could return to our communities, busi-
nesses,  and  children.  Several  million  automotive  and  other  transportation-equip-
ment  jobs  now  at  risk  can  be  saved,  and  one  million  net  new  jobs  can  be  added 
across all sectors. U.S. automotive, trucking, and aircraft production can again lead 
the world, underpinned by 21st century advanced-materials and fuel-cell industries. 
Amore efficient and deployable military could refocus on its core mission—protecting 
American citizens rather than foreign supply lines—while supporting and deploying 
the  innovations  that  eliminate  oil  as  a  cause  of  conflict.  Carbon  dioxide  emissions 
will  shrink  by  one-fourth  with  no  additional  cost  or  effort.  The  rich-poor  divide  can 
be drastically narrowed at home by increased access to affordable personal mobility, 
shrinking  the  welfare  rolls,  and  abroad  by  leapfrogging  over  oil-dependent  develop-
ment  patterns.  The  U.S.  could  treat  oil-rich  countries  the  same  as  countries  with 
no oil. Being no longer suspected of seeking oil in all that it does in the world would 
help to restore U.S. moral leadership and clarity of purpose. 

While  the  $180-billion  investment  needed  is  significant,  the  United  States’  econ-
omy  already  pays  that  much,  with  zero  return,  every  time  the  oil  price  spikes  up 
as it has done in 2004. (And that money goes into OPEC’s coffers instead of building 
infrastructure  at  home.)  Just  by  2015,  the  early  steps  in  this  proposed  transition 
will  have  saved  as  much  oil  as  the  U.S.  gets  from  the  Persian  Gulf.  By  2040,  oil 
imports could be gone. By 2050, the U.S. economy should be flourishing with no oil 
at all. 

How  do  we  get  started?  Every  sector  of  society  can  contribute  to  this  national 
project.  Astute  business  leaders  will  align  their  corporate  strategies  and  reorganize 
their firms and processes to turn innovation from a threat to a friend. Military lead-
ers  will  speed  military  transformation  by  promptly  laying  its  foundation  in  super-
efficient platforms and lean logistics. Political leaders will craft policies that stimu-

late demand for efficient vehicles, reduce R&D and manufacturing investment risks, 
support  the  creation  of  secure  domestic  fuel  supplies,  and  eliminate  perverse  sub-
sidies and regulatory obstacles. Last, we, the people, must play a role—a big role— 
because our individual choices guide the markets, enforce accountability, and create 
social innovation. 

Our  energy  future  is  choice,  not  fate.  Oil  dependence  is  a  problem  we  need  no 
longer have—and it’s cheaper not to. U.S. oil dependence can be eliminated by prov-
en  and  attractive  technologies  that  create  wealth,  enhance  choice,  and  strengthen 
common security. This could be achieved only about as far in the future as the 1973 
Arab  oil  embargo  is  in  the  past.  When  the  U.S.  last  paid  attention  to  oil,  in  1977– 
1985,  it  cut  its  oil  use  17  percent  while  GDP  grew  27  percent.  Oil  imports  fell  50 
percent, and imports from the Persian Gulf by 87 percent, in just 8 years. That ex-
ercise  of  dominant  market  power—from  the  demand  side—broke  OPEC’s  ability  to 
set  world  oil  prices  for  a  decade.  Today  we  can  rerun  that  play,  only  better.  The 
obstacles are less important than the opportunities if we replace ignorance with in-
sight, inattention with foresight, and inaction with mobilization. American business 
can  lead  the  Nation  and  the  world  into  the  post-petroleum  era,  a  vibrant  economy, 
and lasting security—if we just realize that we are the people we have been waiting 
for. 

Together we can end oil dependence forever.

ENDING OUR OIL DEPENDENCE 

REPLACING ALL THE OIL THE U.S. NEEDS WILL COST LESS THAN BUYING IT 

by Amory B. Lovins 

The United States of America has the world’s mightiest economy and most mobile 

society. Yet the oil that fueled its strength has become its greatest weakness. 

Fortunately,  this  10,000-gallon-a-second  oil  habit  is  also  uneconomic,  and  Amer-
ican  business  is  the  greatest  force  on  Earth  for  turning  market  imperfections  into 
profits. 

The  United  States  can  eliminate  its  oil  dependence  and  revitalize  its  economy— 
not  by  passing  Federal  laws,  taxing  fuels,  biasing  markets,  subsidizing  favorites, 
mandating  technologies,  limiting  choices,  or  crimping  lifestyles,  but  by  adopting 
smart  business  strategies.  If  government  steers,  not  rows,  then  competitive  enter-
prise,  supported  by  judicious  policy  and  vibrant  civil  society,  can  turn  the  oil  chal-
lenge  into  an  unprecedented  opportunity  for  wealth  creation  and  common  security. 
How can this be done? President Ronald Reagan’s National Security Advisor, Rob-
ert  C.  McFarlane,  wrote  in  an  op-ed  in  The  Wall  Street  Journal  published  on  Dec. 
20,  2004,  that 
‘‘perhaps  the  most  rigorous  and  surely  the  most  dramatic 
analysis . . . was tasked by the Pentagon and carried out by . . . Rocky Mountain 
Institute, a respected center of hard-headed, market-based research.’’ Three months 
earlier,  my  team  released  that  independent,  peer-reviewed,  329-page  study—Win-
ning the Oil Endgame: Innovation for Profits, Jobs, and Security—and posted it with 
all  technical  backup  at  www.oilendgame.com.  More  than  170,000  free  copies  have 
already been downloaded. Here’s a summary. But first, a little history is necessary. 
In 1850, oil from the giant whaling industry lit most homes. Yet in the nine years 
before  Drake  struck  oil  in  1859,  five-sixths  of  the  whale-oil  market  vanished:  com-
petition  elicited  cheaper  alternatives  that  the  whalers  had  not  expected.  They  ran 
out of customers before they ran out of whales, the rest of which were saved by cap-
italists and technological innovators. 

Today,  the  globe-girdling  oil  industry  seems  poised  to  follow  suit.  Might  oil  be-
come  uncompetitive  even  at  low  prices  before  it  becomes  unavailable  even  at  high 
prices?  To  find  out,  my  economists,  engineers,  scientists  and  consultants  added  up 
the modern competitors for the first time. We examined decades’ backlog of powerful 
new  technologies  for  saving  and  displacing  oil.  We  arranged  them  in  order  of  in-
creasing  cost  on  a  uniform  accounting  basis.  Surprise!  The  robustly  competitive  op-
tions  could  save  half  the  oil  America  uses  and  substitute  cheaper  alternatives  for 
the  rest,  all  led  by  business-for-profit.  The  transition  beyond  oil  has  three  parallel 
elements: 

• Redouble  the  efficiency  of  using  oil.  The  United  States  now  gets  twice  as  much 
GDP per barrel as in 1975, but can wring out twice as much again by applying 
proven  2004  technologies.  Saving  each  barrel  will  cost  only  $12  (in  year-2000

dollars)—less  than  half  what  the  government  forecasts  oil  will  cost  in  2025,  or 
a  fourth  the  recent  price,  so  even  more  efficiency  would  be  worth  buying.  Con-
servatively,  we  valued  oil’s  unmonetized  economic,  military  and  environmental 
costs  at  zero,  and  assumed  the  same  activities,  vehicle  attributes  and  lifestyles 
as  the  government  forecast—then  found  ways  to  deliver  these  outcomes  with 
less oil, less money and more brains. 
Personal vehicles use 42 percent of U.S. oil and cause 58 percent of its forecast 
growth.  Only  1  percent  of  their  fuel  energy  moves  the  driver.  Yet  George  P. 
Shultz’s Foreword to our study says: ‘‘Hybrid technology is already on the road, 
and  currently  increases  gas  mileage  by  50  percent  or  more.  . . .  New,  ultra-
light-but-safe  materials  can  nearly  redouble  fuel  economy  at  little  or  no  extra 
cost.  . . .’’  Ultralight,  ultrastrong  carbon-fiber  composite  autobodies  (make-able 
by  a  technique  displayed  by  a  Tier  One  supplier  at  the  2005  Detroit  Auto 
Show), backstopped by new lightweight steels, can yield uncompromised, afford-
able 66-mpg hybrid SUVs and 92-mpg hybrid cars that pay back in three years. 
The  materials’  extra  cost  is  offset  by  simpler  auto-making  and  smaller  propul-
sion  systems.  Per  pound,  the  composites  can  absorb  6–12  times  as  much  crash 
energy as steel, so by making cars big, which is protective, but not heavy, which 
is hostile and fuel-wasting, they can save oil and lives. 
Even without lighter materials, if 2025’s cars and light trucks were only as effi-
cient  as  2005’s  popular  hybrids,  they’d  save  a  sixth  of  forecast  oil  use,  or  two 
Persian  Gulfs’  worth.  Together,  cost-effectively  efficient  vehicles,  factories  and 
buildings can cut U.S. oil use by 29 percent in 2025, rising to 52 percent as ve-
hicle stocks turn over. 

• Save half of natural gas at an eighth of today’s market price, and then substitute 
it  for  nearly  a  third  of  the  oil.  Established,  highly  profitable  efficiency  tech-
niques can save 12 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of gas a year. In all, 15 TCF a year 
can  be  freed  up  to  displace  oil,  directly  or  (more  efficiently  and  profitably)  via 
hydrogen.  Saving  just  1  percent  of  U.S.  electricity,  including  peak  hours,  saves 
2 percent of total gas use and cuts gas prices by 3–4 percent. By this leverage, 
just  the  early  savings  would  make  gas  affordable  and  abundant  again,  cut  gas 
and  power  bills  by  $55  billion  a  year,  and  avoid  the  cost,  siting  problems  and 
vulnerability of new liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and powerlines. 

• Replace the last fifth of U.S. oil with modern biofuels. Two percent of U.S. gaso-
line  today  is  substituted  by  costly,  heavily  subsidized  ethanol  made  from  corn- 
based  sugars.  Making  ethanol  instead  from  the  woody  parts  of  plants  like 
switchgrass and poplar doubles the yield while saving capital and energy. With-
out  competing  for  food  crops’  land  or  water,  such  ‘‘cellulosic  ethanol,’’  plus  bio-
diesel, can cost-effectively displace nearly four million barrels of oil per day, cre-
ate  750,000  rural  jobs,  and  boost  farm  income  by  tens  of  billions  of  dollars  a 
year. (Sugarcane ethanol has displaced 25 percent of Brazil’s gasoline, repaying 
initial subsidies 50 times over, and now beats gasoline without subsidy.) 

Within  two  generations,  combining  these  three  steps  could  make  a  more  pros-
perous and secure America completely oil-free (see graph). This will require $90 bil-
lion of investment to retool the car, truck and plane industries, so that rather than 
importing efficient vehicles to replace foreign oil, we make efficient vehicles and im-
port  neither.  Building  an  advanced  biofuels  industry  will  take  another  $90  billion. 
This  $180  billion  of  private  investment  will  by  2025  return  every  year  more  than 
$150 billion gross ($133 billion of it from saved oil) or $70 billion net, add a million 
new jobs, and preserve another million jobs, chiefly automotive, now at risk.

Making America More Competitive 

The  business  case  is  compelling:  cheaper  trucking  with  doubled  margins,  afford-
able petrochemical feedstocks and airline fuel, lower and more stable fuel prices for 
all,  and  restored  American  primacy  in  making  cars,  trucks  and  planes.  And  the  al-
ternative is grim. China’s ambitious car-export plans fit Beijing’s new energy policy 
focused  on  efficient  use  and  breakthrough  technologies.  Will  China  export  your  un-
cle’s Buick? More likely you’ll drive home your super-efficient Chinese car from Wal- 
Mart. The Big Three automakers will be toast unless they adopt advanced efficiency 
technologies first. 

Such ‘‘disruptive’’ business shifts are hard. However, hesitating risks a slow, cha-
otic  transition  rife  with  wars  and  disruptions.  Protecting  national  competitiveness 
and  security  requires  instead  an  orderly  transition  harnessing  America’s  strengths 
in  technology  and  private  enterprise,  accelerated  by  light-handed  policies  that  sup-
port, not distort, business logic. 

Our study therefore suggested modest policy innovations that are market-oriented 
without  taxes,  innovation-driven  without  mandates,  doable  administratively  or  at  a 
state level (where many are bubbling up), and previously overlooked in Washington. 
For example: 

• ‘‘Feebates’’ for new cars and light trucks combine fees on inefficient models with 
rebates on efficient ones—all calculated separately within each size class, so one 
isn’t penalized for choosing an SUV, but rewarded for choosing an efficient SUV. 
Whatever  vehicle  size  you  want  would  offer  more  choices  as  the  greater  price 
spread between more and less efficient models pulls innovations faster from the 
lab to the showroom. Feebates encourage you to invest in fuel savings over the 
vehicle’s  life,  not  just  the  first  few  years.  Rebates  no  bigger  than  current 
$4,000–$5,000  manufacturer  sales  incentives  would  actually  make  money  for 
producers as well as consumers, and be trued up each year to stay revenue-neu-
tral. The fuel savings would be like buying gasoline at 57¢ a gallon—worthwhile 
even if the big savings made oil prices plummet.

curement can speed innovation and reduce automaker’s investment risk. 

• Low-income  families  lack  affordable  personal  mobility—the  last  frontier  of  wel-
fare  reform.  Junking  clunkers  and  creatively  financing  super-efficient  and  reli-
able new cars could cleanse urban air, expand low-income employment opportu-
nities, and create a profitable new million-car-a-year market for advanced-tech-
nology vehicles. 
• Governments  buy  hundreds  of  thousands  of  light  vehicles  a  year.  Smart  pro-
• Innovation-friendly  policies  like  temporary  Federal  loan  guarantees  (structured 
to  cost  the  Treasury  nothing)  can  help  automakers  retool  and  retrain,  and  air-
lines buy efficient airplanes while scrapping inefficient ones. 
• Tweaking  USDA  rules  can  let  profitable  biofuels  and  biomaterials  replace  loss- 
making  crops  and  durable  revenues  replace  subsidies,  ultimately  tripling  net 
farm and ranch income. 
• The 48 states that reward gas and electric distribution utilities for selling more 
energy and penalize them for cutting customers’ bills can easily purge this per-
verse incentive—as state utility commissioners unanimously urged in 1989. 
• The  military  imperative  of  light,  agile,  fuel-efficient  forces  can  protect  troops 
and  fuel  supply  lines,  save  tens  of  billions  of  dollars  in  annual  fuel-logistics 
costs, realign force structures from tail to tooth, avoid poisonous geopolitical ri-
valries over oil, and ultimately help prevent the fighting of wars over oil. 

Being  able  to  treat  countries  with  oil  the  same  as  countries  without  oil,  and  no 
longer  giving  anyone  cause  to  think  U.S.  actions  are  about  oil,  would  help  defuse 
global suspicions and conflicts. By modestly shifting its technology budgets and pro-
curing  fuel-efficient  platforms,  the  Defense  Department  could  spawn  broadly  trans-
formative  advanced-materials  civilian  industries—just  as  it  did  with  the  Internet, 
GPS, and microchips that propel today’s economy. 
A Better Energy Policy 

The  required  one-time  $180  billion  investment,  spread  reasonably  over  a  decade, 
averages  $18  billion  a  year.  That’s  what  America  now  pays  for  foreign  oil  every  5– 
6  weeks.  At  the  forecast  2025  price  of  $26  a  barrel,  the  oil  saving  of  $133  billion 
a year would act like a large and permanent tax cut, but one that corrects, not exac-
erbates,  today’s  fiscal  imbalances.  And  the  savings  would  become  big  even  in  the 
first decade. 

Rather  than  sending  $120  billion  a  year  abroad  for  oil  (partly  to  fund  our  en-
emies), we would reinvest it in our own companies and communities, and pocket the 
surplus.  Drilling  for  oil  under  Detroit,  we  would  discover  a  trove  of  vehicular  effi-
ciency  bigger  than  Saudi  Arabia’s  oil  output,  but  all-American,  squeaky-clean  and 
inexhaustible. 

Our analysis assumed vehicle improvements two-fifths slower than after the 1979 
oil  shock,  and  enormously  slower  than  in  the  1920s  (when  autobodies  shifted  from 
wood  to  steel  in  six  years)  or  in  World  War  II  (when  Detroit  mobilized  in  six 
months).  Indeed,  our  proposed  oil  savings  are  much  slower  than  America  achieved 
when  she  last  paid  attention.  During  1977-85,  27  percent  GDP  growth  was  accom-
panied by 17 percent lower oil use, 50 percent lower oil imports, and a stunning 87 
percent  drop  in  Persian  Gulf  imports.  OPEC’s  sales  fell  48  percent,  breaking  the 
cartel’s  market  power  for  a  decade.  The  United  States  showed  it  had  more  market 
power  than  OPEC—but  on  the  demand  side:  America  is  the  Saudi  Arabia  of 
negabarrels, able to save oil faster than OPEC can conveniently sell less oil. Today’s 
potent  technologies  and  policy  options  could  make  that  old  play  even  more  success-
ful. 

Automakers  are  already  scrambling  to  make  advanced-technology  vehicles,  and 
the  oil  industry,  where  I’ve  consulted  for  32  years,  is  generally  receptive.  Shell’s 
former Chairman, Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, wrote in his Foreword that our study re-
flects  ‘‘technical  rigour,  good  humour,  and  common  sense,’’  as  well  as  ‘‘refreshingly 
creative policies . . . [that] merit serious attention. . . .’’ Many oil-industry leaders 
agree that with foresight and supportive policies, they can profitably redeploy assets 
and skills in the post-petroleum era, as some already do with branded biofuels. The 
hydrogen  in  their  oil  may  even  be  worth  more  without  the  carbon  than  with  the 
carbon  (even  if  nobody  pays  to  keep  carbon  out  of  the  air),  because  hydrogen  can 
be used far more efficiently than hydrocarbons. 

The result: By 2015, early savings will displace as much annual oil as the United 
States now gets from the Persian Gulf; then every seven years (at 3 percent annual 
GDP  growth)  can  save  another  Gulf  ‘s  worth.  By  2040,  oil  imports  could  be  gone. 
By  2050,  the  United  States  economy  could  be  oil-free  and  thriving,  dominant  again 
in  transportation  equipment.  A  more  effective  and  efficient  but  less  overstretched

military could refocus on protecting American citizens, not foreign pipelines. Rather 
than prolonging for decades our reliance on the frighteningly vulnerable Trans-Alas-
ka  Pipeline  to  haul  oil  that’s  too  costly  for  oil  majors  to  drill,  this  grave  threat  to 
national  energy  security  could  phase  out  on  schedule.  Carbon  emissions  would 
shrink  by  one-fourth  as  a  free  byproduct  of  profitable  oil  savings.  Federal  budget 
deficits  would  shrink  slightly,  trade  deficits  vastly.  The  United  States  could  regain 
moral stature and esteem as it led a more peaceful world beyond oil. 

Oil  dependence  is  a  problem  America  needn’t  have,  and  it’s  cheaper  not  to.  Get-
ting  profitably,  attractively  and  completely  off  oil—led  by  business,  implemented 
through  markets,  sped  by  barrier-busting,  boosted  technologically  by  the  Pentagon 
for  military  effectiveness  and  conflict  prevention—would  express  America’s  highest 
ideals, honor its market and political principles, and enhance its security. Informed 
citizens  will  drive  this  transition  as  they  guide  markets,  enforce  accountability  and 
create grassroots innovation. 

A better energy policy process would offer even wider benefits for a stronger coun-
try  and  a  safer  world.  Letting  all  ways  to  save  or  produce  energy  compete  fairly  at 
honest  prices—no  matter  what  kind  they  are,  what  technology  they  use,  how  big 
they  are,  or  who  owns  them—is  far  from  today’s  hogs-at-the-trough  approach,  but 
it’s what conservative economics demands and what the Nation’s broad hidden con-
sensus (www.nepinitiative.org) would support. 

Mr. Shultz concludes: ‘‘We can, as Amory Lovins and his colleagues show vividly, 
win  the  oil  endgame.’’  Mr.  McFarlane  concurs:  ‘‘It  is  becoming  clear  . . .  that  the 
means  to  achieving  near-term  energy  security  and  ultimate  independence  from  for-
eign  oil  are  at  hand.  Courage  and  leadership  are  all  that  it  takes  to  get  us  there.’’ 
And the preamble to President George W. Bush’s 2001 energy policy statement says 
it  best:  ‘‘Our  country  has  met  many  great  tests.  Some  have  imposed  extreme  hard-
ship and sacrifice. Others have demanded only resolve, ingenuity, and clarity of pur-
pose. Such is the case with energy today.’’

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you  very  much.  That’s  a  very  hopeful 

statement. 

Let  me  get  mundane  here.  My  experience  goes  back  to  the  time 
when  there  was  competition  at  the  gas  station,  and  prices  were 
coming  down  because  of  it.  I  worked  in  a  small  gas  station,  and  I 
soon  learned  that  if  the  gas  price  went  down  too  low,  by  the  time 
the  next  truck  came  back  they  couldn’t  buy  enough  gas  to  fill  the 
tanks  up  to  keep  in  business.  Now,  we  hear  a  lot  about  price- 
gouging from the gas stations. Could one, or both of you, comment 
on  the  role  for  people  that  are  operating  gas  stations.  In  my  judg-
ment, it is necessary to raise the price in order to have the money 
to  buy  the  next  load  of  fuel  to  sell  to  their  consumers.  Am  I  right 
or wrong? 

Mr. West? 
Mr.  WEST.  Senator,  I  think  that’s  essentially  correct,  that  the 
gas-station  owners—and  90—about  90  percent  of  the  gas  stations 
in  the  United  States  are  owned  independently;  they’re  not  owned 
by  the  big  oil  companies.  Basically,  they  buy  in  expectation  of  re-
placement  cost.  That’s  the—which  is  what  you’re  saying—that’s 
how they operate. 

There  may  be  instances  of  price-gouging,  but  price-gouging  is 
very  difficult  if  there  is  competition.  If  there’s  no  competition, 
maybe you can do it. But, basically, it is expectation of replacement 
cost. That’s what drives them. 

The CHAIRMAN. Do you have any comment, Mr. Bustnes? 
Mr.  BUSTNES.  No,  I  completely  agree,  actually.  I  agree  with  Mr. 

West.

The CHAIRMAN. You’ve each commented upon measures we could 
take.  Do  you  think  that  those  measures  take  legislation  to  accom-
plish?  Are  these  measures  you’ve  suggested,  such  that  could  be 
done  by  the  industry,  without  any  further  changes  in  our  national 
laws? 

Mr. WEST. On my—the two things which I have mentioned—the 
two  short-term  fixes,  which  are  increased  inventory  and  redun-
dancy  in  systems  in  refineries  and  in  pipelines—theoretically,  the 
industry could do them by themselves. But there’s a cost. And par-
ticularly  on  the—maintaining  inventories.  If  they  do  it  for  a  long 
period  of  time,  it  could  be  quite  expensive.  But,  essentially,  they 
could  do  it,  and,  I  think,  should  be  encouraged  to  do  it.  But,  I 
think, long-term, a framework should be established. 

Mr. BUSTNES. Two thoughts—— 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Bustnes? 
Mr.  BUSTNES.—two  thoughts  come  to  mind,  Mr.  Chairman.  Re-
garding  the  question  as  to  whether  we  should  have  policy  to  en-
courage  these  technologies  of—for  efficiency,  for  instance—to  enter 
the  marketplace.  My  answer  would  be  that,  you  know,  over  the 
long-term,  economics  is  going  to  sort  these  things  out,  if  you  will. 
The marketplace will sort these things out. However, policy can be 
very helpful, in terms of accelerating the marketplace, and what is 
delivered  into  the  marketplace  in  the  direction  that  we  want.  And 
this  is  why  we  leave  it  out  as  an  option  to  help  that  acceleration. 
Now,  specifically,  does  it  require  legislation,  or  can  these  things 
be done administratively? It’s the latter. Most of the things that we 
suggest as policy options, Mr. Chairman, can be done in an admin-
istrative fashion, as opposed to having to do legislation. 

The  other  point  to  note,  that  I  very  much  agree  with,  is  that, 
when it comes to this being a national effort, it will require coordi-
nation  between  the  Federal,  State,  and  local  levels.  There’s  no 
question in my mind that that is correct. And, as such, many of the 
measures  that  we’re  talking  about  in  this  report  can  be  done  at, 
say, a State level. And, in fact, it could be a very interesting thing 
for  this  country  to  let  the  states  experiment  a  little  bit  before  we 
adopted certain things on a Federal level. 

Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. One last—pardon me, go ahead. 
Mr.  WEST.  I  was  just  going  to  add  one  thing.  I  think  there’s  one 
area  that’s  very  important,  and  that  is,  if  you  want  to  build  new 
refineries  in  the  United  States,  you’re  simply  going  to  have  to  re-
view,  particularly,  the  question  of  new  source  review,  in  terms  of 
environmental  permitting.  And  whether  that  requires  a  change  of 
law  or  regulation,  I’m  not  sure,  but  that  really  is  a  very  serious 
problem. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Shortly,  should  the  Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve 
play  any  part  in  our  consideration  of  the  price  of  the  product  sold 
at the pump? 

Mr.  WEST.  I  would  respectfully  submit  that  Katrina  was  an 
interruption of supply, which affected price. So, it was entirely ap-
propriate  to  use  it.  To  just  use  it  to  manage  price,  I’m  not  sure 
that’s such a good idea, because it can become politicized, at times, 
as  it  has  in  the  past.  But  I  think  in  terms  of—again,  I  go  back  to 
my  point—the  government  is  a  factor.  It’s  important  to  recognize, 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  15:23 May 10, 2011 Jkt 066218 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\66218.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

the  government,  immediately  after  9/11,  started  filling  SPRO  with 
royalty  oil  from  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  for  the  purposes  of  supporting 
the  market  and  taking  oil  off  the  market.  So,  the  government  was 
intervening  in  the  market.  Now  people  say,  ‘‘Well,  we  can’t  use 
SPRO.’’  But  I—to  release  oil—but,  in  fact,  it  was  being  used  pre-
viously  to  pull  the  oil  off.  So,  what  I’m  trying  to  say  is,  to  get— 
have government understand its role in the market, and make sure 
it’s consistent. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Very  shortly.  You  want  to  add  anything,  Mr. 

Mr.  BUSTNES.  I  can’t  comment  on  that,  sorry.  Sorry,  Mr.  Chair-

Bustnes? 

man. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Inouye, you’re recognized for 5 minutes. 
Senator INOUYE. I believe all of us recognize that, though we rep-
resent  about  4  percent  of  the  world’s  population,  we  consume  over 
a quarter of all of the fossil fuel. My State of Hawaii, 20 years ago, 
had  to  depend  upon  fossil  fuel  to  the  extent  of  about  95  percent, 
because  nothing  else  was  available.  And  so,  we’ve  tried  every-
thing—geothermal,  now  we’re  successfully  looking  at  solar  energy, 
and we’re looking into wind energy, et cetera. But, even at that, it’s 
just a dent. 

All  of  us  have  attempted  to  do  something  about  CAFE  stand-
ards—other  sources,  biofuel.  And  it’s  like  pulling  teeth.  It’s  not 
easy.  And  so,  how  about  talking  about  a  little  supply,  not  just  de-
mand?  I  realize  this  is  controversial,  but  I’ve  supported  the  Chair-
man  for  many  years  on  ANWR.  Is  that  a  wise  decision,  or  a  bad 
decision, to open up ANWR, as suggested by legislation? 

Mr.  WEST.  Mr.  Chairman,  I—one  of  the  things  that  I  think  is 
very  important  is,  if  you  look  at—on  my  testimony,  on  page  2, 
you’ll see a chart. It said, ‘‘World’s production is comprised of many 
fields.’’  And  the  way  the  international  oil  business  works  is,  there 
are  not  one  or  two  huge  valves  you  open;  there  are  literally  thou-
sands  of  fields  around  the  world.  And  we’re  concerned  that  we’re 
going  to  become  increasingly  reliant  on  oil  from  unreliable  places, 
such as Russia and Saudi Arabia. And you can see here, in the cat-
egory  on  the  right,  it  says,  ‘‘Biggest  fields  in  North  America  and 
the  North  Sea,’’  and  you  can  see  the  production  from  the  biggest 
one  is  Prudhoe,  and  that’s  under  a  million  barrels.  If  ANWR  were 
to  come  on,  it  would  be  the  biggest  field  in  North  America  or  the 
North  Sea.  This  is  not  trivial.  And  I  think  right  now  we  have  an 
energy  policy  which  discourages  production  and  encourages  con-
sumption. And that is absolutely unsustainable. 

Decisions  were  made—Senators  concerned  with—a  number  of 
Senators  have  been  concerned  about  natural  gas.  A  decision  was 
made  to  basically  rule  out  the  eastern  Gulf  of  Mexico.  One  of  the 
problems we have is that when—for the last 20 years, when energy 
issues  came  up  and  collided  against  any  other  issue,  when  it  col-
lided  against  tourism  and  real  estate  in  Florida,  we  said,  ‘‘No,  no, 
that  industry  will  prevail  over  natural  gas  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.’’ 
We can’t go into the Rocky Mountain area, we can’t go into a num-
ber of areas. 

Now, if this is the decision people want, that’s fine, but recognize 
there is a cost. And, as I say, in terms of ANWR, it would be a sig-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  15:23 May 10, 2011 Jkt 066218 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\66218.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

nificant  secure  field.  Does  that  make  sense,  as  you  look  at  the 
world? I think it does. But not everyone agrees. 

Mr.  BUSTNES.  Could  I  make  an  additional  comment  to  that—— 
Senator INOUYE. Please. 
Mr. BUSTNES.—Senator? You make a very important observation, 
which is that the United States essentially burns up about a quar-
ter  of  the  global  energy.  In  terms  of  oil,  specifically,  today  we  con-
sume,  globally,  about  82  million  barrels  per  day  of  oil,  and  the 
United  States  consumes  about  20–21  of  those.  The  price  of  oil,  as 
we’ve  heard  before,  is  essentially  set  between  supply-and-demand 
in the global market. There is a very interesting data point, if you 
go  back,  historically  speaking,  on  this  topic,  which  is  this  issue  of 
excess  capacity  to  produce  oil  versus  what  is  consumed  by  the 
world.  Generally  speaking,  if  you  go  below  three  million  barrels  a 
day  of  excess  capacity,  historically  it’s  always  shown  that  you  will 
see more volatility in the price of oil. So, the point being, the price 
of  oil  is  driven,  fundamentally,  by  supply-and-demand,  on  top  of 
which  you  have  real  risks,  such  as  weather  or  terrorism,  on  top  of 
which you have speculators. 

In the last couple of years, what we’ve seen is a tremendous run- 
up of speculation as a result of movements on the fundamental de-
mand-and-supply  picture.  My  sources  in  the  oil  industry  tell  me, 
that  right  now,  about  a  trillion  dollars  a  year  is  pushed  around, 
speculating on oil alone, never mind natural gas. 

If you want to change this picture, you’ve got to look at the fun-
damental demand/supply situation. If you want to change demand, 
we’ve  got  to  look  at  efficiency.  And  that’s  what  our  report  has 
looked at very carefully across all sectors. We have examined that, 
and we have found the potential is quite large—and economical. 

If you want to look at supply, think of biofuels as adding to your 
refinery  capacity,  if  you  will.  It’s  another  option,  part  of  the  port-
folio package. 
Thank you. 
Senator INOUYE. I agree with you completely, but I hope that we 
can  convince  people  of  this  Nation.  We  have  been  struggling  over 
the  years  on  CAFE  standards.  Finally,  cars  are  coming  down,  but 
they’re  resisting  it,  ‘‘Let’s  stretch  this  out  for  another  five  more 
years. Let’s go beyond that.’’ 

Prius  came  out,  by  Toyota,  and  others  have  caught  on,  but  yet 
we  make  SUVs  actually  a  truck,  so  they  don’t  get  taxed  as  much 
as passenger cars. What does it take us to really realize that we’re 
in danger? 

Mr.  WEST.  Senator,  what  I’ve  tried  to  do  in  this  little  report  is 
to say that—I mean, my last sentence is that if we dither anymore, 
as  we  have  for  so  long,  we  will  pay  a  terrible  price,  the  economic 
equivalent  of  a  Category@hurricane.  Katrina  was  a  Category  4. 
And  I  think  that—I  agree  with  you  that  we  must  act,  but  I  think 
one  of  the  things  that’s  important  is  that  a  lot  of  people  who  have 
not  participated  in  this  debate  actually  have—they’ve—as  I  say, 
the  American  Association  of  Retired  People,  for  example,  has  a 
huge  stake  in  this  debate.  They—and  they’re  a  very  powerful  con-
stituency,  and  have  done  nothing  on  this.  And  I  think  people  like 
this  have  got  to  participate.  And  it  should  make  it  easier,  frankly, 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  15:23 May 10, 2011 Jkt 066218 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\66218.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

43 

for people such as yourself who want to act, because it can give you 
the—some more political resources to act. 

Mr. BUSTNES. If I may add to that, you’re looking for signs. What 
should tell us when to act? And I think signs include when the U.S. 
automotive sector goes out of business because it can’t compete any 
longer  with  the  Toyotas  of  the  world.  It  includes  our  heavy  trucks 
basically  being  run  by  unprofitable  companies.  These  are  signs  of 
the times that you see today, actually. 

I  would  submit  to  you,  Senator,  that  if  there  are  two  immediate 
next steps that we could do—because you look around and you see 
it,  you  see  hybrids,  led  by  Toyota;  you  see  advanced  materials,  led 
by  BMW  and  Honda;  you  see  biofuels  research,  some  of  which  is 
happening  here,  but  Europe  leads  the  United  States—on  biodiesel, 
for example—by a factor of 17. These are some signs of things that 
are changing right now, as we speak. 

What  can  we  do  here  in  this  country?  I  would  say,  immediately, 
two  specific  steps.  First,  redirect  R&D  to  critical  technologies  that 
we  know  will  work.  For  example,  advanced  materials  and  biofuels 
research and development, and commercialization. And, second, en-
sure  that  business  here—I  mean,  this  is  a  choice  that  you  can 
make, essentially, as a country—but if we want these industries to 
exist,  going  forward,  we’ve  got  a  choice,  and  the  choice  is  to  help 
the  automotive  industry,  plane  and  truck  industries,  put  out  effi-
cient  products  in  the  marketplace,  be  it  through  loan  guarantees 
that  may  not  need  to  cost  the  Treasury  anything,  or  other  initia-
tives. These are initiatives that can be made. 

Thank you. 
Senator INOUYE. Thank you very much. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  don’t  want  to  be  dis-
respectful, but that little thing in front of you, flashes red when the 
time’s up. If you can help us with time, we’d appreciate it. 

Senator Snowe, you have not had an opening statement. We each 

had 2 minutes. Would you like 2 minutes? 

Senator SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll wait, and I’ll ask 

my questions. 

The CHAIRMAN. Very well. 
Senator SNOWE. Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Nelson? 
Senator BEN NELSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I mentioned the problem that is being recognized right now with 
the high cost, and the increasing cost, of natural gas and the avail-
ability of natural gas that could be increased through the pipeline, 
that  has  been  proposed  from  Alaska  to  the  continental  United 
States,  the  adjacent  states.  It  seems  to  me  that  if  we  were  able  to 
do that, that might be helpful. However, the time between now and 
the completion of that is not something that would give us any im-
mediate  relief,  and  communities  are  looking  for  immediate  relief, 
particularly as we go to the—toward the winter season, where reli-
ance  on  natural  gas  is  going  to  be  so  important  to  home  heating. 
I  mentioned  the  Mayor  of  Fremont,  Nebraska,  Mayor  Skip 
Edwards,  and  his  concerns  about  what’s  increasing.  And  he  has 
asked  the  question,  which  I  think’s  a  legitimate  question,  and  I 
would like to get your thoughts about it, and that is about the over-
sight  on  the  speculation  that  goes  on  in  the  commodities  market,

and  as  to  whether  or  not  gas  or  oil—in  this  case,  either  one— 
should be treated as a commodity traded on in the market, whether 
that  stabilizes,  as  some  have  suggested  that  it  will,  the  price,  or 
whether  that  destabilizes  the  price.  I’d  like  to  get  your  thoughts. 

Mr. West? 
Mr. WEST. Senator Nelson, as a general rule, the more capital in 
a  market,  if  it’s  a  transparent  market,  the  more  efficient  the  mar-
ket.  If  there  are  just  a  couple  of  players  in  the  market,  it’s  easier 
to  distort  the  market.  So,  I  don’t  think  that  the  speculators  are— 
this really isn’t the problem, Senator. 

Senator  BEN NELSON.  Well,  but  if  you  see  a  run-up  at  the  level 
that  it  has  been  going,  in  many  cases  they’re—the  markets  stop. 
In  other  words,  there’s  a  stop-loss  or  stop-mechanisms  that  says 
that  if  they  go  above  a  certain  level  at  any  particular  time,  that 
cuts it off, so the trading doesn’t further destabilize the commodity. 
What are your thoughts about that? Either of you. 

Mr. WEST. But, Senator, with all due respect, I think what’s hap-
pened  is,  the  market  has—it’s  certainly,  in  natural  gas  in  the  last 
18 months—and I think—by the way, natural gas this winter may 
be a more serious problem, and Hurricane Rita may compound the 
natural-gas problem, actually—— 

Senator  BEN NELSON.  Well,  that’s  one  of  the  reasons  I’m  raising 

it. 

Mr. WEST. Yes. This is—— 
Senator BEN NELSON. Because I am very concerned about it. 
Mr. WEST.—this is very serious. And the Gulf of Mexico is a very 
important  source  of  natural  gas.  But  I  think  that—I  don’t  think— 
speculators  can’t  keep  driving  markets  up  and  up.  The  market  is 
just too big, and too liquid, and too deep. 

Mr.  BUSTNES.  Let  me  add  to  that.  I  completely  concur.  The  pic-
ture I would paint of the market is one of three critical factors. The 
first  factor  is  the  fundamentals  of  demand  and  supply.  The  second 
factor contains risk—real risk factors, like the terror premium, like 
hurricanes, like weather and climate. The third factor is the factor 
containing  those  speculators  that  you  are  asking  about,  and  their 
operations in the market. What’s happening today is that we’ve got 
a  fundamental  tight  supply-and-demand  situation  compounded  by 
these natural risks that we’ve just seen recently. 

Going  forward,  if  you  take  a  long-term,  sound  look  at  the  situa-
tion, the thing to focus on is the fundamentals, and the fundamen-
tals  that  you’ve  got  to  look  at  in  this  case,  I  would  submit  to  you, 
because it’s economically just a win-win, would be the demand side 
of this equation. 

We  know—there  are  piles  and  piles  of  studies  out  there  that 
show  how  to  reduce  the  oil  consumption  in  this  country  by  30,  40, 
50 percent. We’ve just got to do it together as a country. That’s the 
critical challenge ahead of us. And we can do it. 

Thank you. 
Senator BEN NELSON. Well, working toward—I think working to-
ward  supply,  as  opposed  to  Mr.  West’s  suggestion,  trying  not  to— 
trying  to  increase  working  on  the  demand  side—perhaps  there’s  a 
little  bit  of  a  difference  of  opinion  about  how  we  go  about  doing 
that.

But, Mr. West, what would constitute an unfair practice or price- 
gouging?  If  supply  or  demand  dictates  it,  and  it’s  not  market  ma-
nipulation in the securities field because there’s enough money that 
comes  in,  and  the  market  is  big  enough  to  be  able  to  control  that, 
what  would,  in  your  opinion,  constitute  price-gouging?  Is  there 
such a thing? 

Mr.  WEST.  Oh,  I—if  you  had  a  captive  market,  it  would  just  be 
putting  up  price—essentially,  I  think,  the  way  you  gouge  is,  you 
withhold from the market. I don’t know how else you’d do it. 
Senator BEN NELSON. Well, would OPEC be guilty of that? 
Mr.  WEST.  Well,  I  think  OPEC  is  kind  of—it’s  a  little—with  all 
due  respect,  I  think  OPEC—first  thing,  it’s—OPEC  is  a  gathering 
of  nations  that  pursue  their  own  self—they  pursue  their  interests, 
as we pursue our interests. 

Senator BEN NELSON. But they’re not—that wouldn’t necessarily 

be gouging, if you’re pursuing your own interests. 

Mr.  WEST.  Well,  there  have  been  times  they  have  withheld  pro-
duction  in  order  to  support  the  price.  They’ve  also  said  they  don’t 
want the price too low, because that damages their economy. They 
also  don’t  want  the  price  too  high,  because  that  could  affect  de-
mand and hurt the market. So, they were going for what they call 
a—excuse me; turn that off—they were going for a price band. 

Frankly, they have blown through the price band. And OPEC, at 

this point, is along for the ride. OPEC, if you look at the—— 

The  CHAIRMAN.  That  had  to  be  one  of  your  clients  objecting  to 

what you said. 
[Laughter.] 
Mr. WEST. Saudi Arabia on the line. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  BEN NELSON.  The  new  Ambassador  from  Saudi  Arabia 

calling. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr.  WEST.  But  OPEC  does  not  control  the  market  now.  One  of 
the points my colleague made here was that spare capacity is crit-
ical.  If  you  look  in  my  testimony,  there’s  a  chart  which  shows  the 
amount  of  spare  capacity,  which  is  largely  in  Saudi  Arabia.  It’s 
under two million barrels. And they said that that would be avail-
able on call, if necessary. 

One  of  the  problems  is  that  that  tends  to  be  heavy  crude,  which 
we  can’t  even  run  in  the  refineries  right  now.  Essentially,  the 
world  system—what  I’m  trying  to  say  is,  the  world  system  is  run-
ning at capacity. There is no significant production being withheld. 
And,  at  times  in  the  past,  they  have  done  it,  but  one  of  the  things 
to understand is, the oil business is cyclical business, and if you go 
back  and  look  at  the  history  of  this  business,  there  have  been  a 
number  of  cycles,  about  20-year  waves.  And  you  had  the  Texas 
Railroad  Commission,  which  withheld  oil  from  the  market  in 
Texas,  you  had  what’s  called  the  ‘‘as-is  agreement,’’  where,  basi-
cally, Standard Oil and Shell divided up the world and withheld oil 
from  the  market.  Then  you  had,  really,  the  dominance  of  the 
‘‘Seven  Sisters,’’  and  then  you  had  the  arrival  of  OPEC.  But  the— 
usually,  there  has  been,  at  some  point—because  when  there  are 
high prices, two things happen. One, more production is brought in. 
And, two, demand declines.

Senator BEN NELSON. Not if it’s controlled. 
Mr.  WEST.  But  the  fact  of  the  matter  is,  is  that  OPEC—if  you 
look  in  the  1980s,  the  OPEC  countries,  economically,  were  really 
struggling in the late 1980s, and they were not awash with money, 
I  assure  you.  And  we  can  provide  all  the  data  you  want  on  that. 
But  OPEC  right  now  is  not—with  all  due  respect,  I  don’t  think 
suing OPEC’s going to get you very far. 

The other thing is, on the subject of Saudi Arabia, I think that— 
Senator  Lautenberg’s  saying  that  they  should  open  up  the  taps  or 
whatever—but  the  fact  of  the  matter  is,  is  that  there’s  a  debate 
going  on  whether  they  can  even  sustain  their  existing  production. 
Saudi  Arabia  is  prepared  to  invest  $50  billion  to  increase  produc-
tion  from  10  to  12-and-a-half  million  barrels  a  day.  Our  view  is 
that Saudi Arabia—think what you may about Saudi Arabia’s polit-
ical  system,  but,  in  terms  of  the  oil  markets,  they’ve  been  pretty 
constructive.  They  have—at  the  time  of  the  Iraq  War,  they  put 
more  money  into  the—put  more  oil  into  the  market.  At  the  time 
of the Venezuelan strike, which was a very important point in this 
business, they put more oil into the market. 

So, I think it’s—I would respectfully submit that people approach 

Saudi Arabia with some knowledgeable caution, sir. 

Senator  BEN NELSON.  I’m  sorry  that—I’m  sorry  I  went  over. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. Senator Cantwell? 
Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr.  Bustnes,  thank  you  for  your  statement  about  investment  in 
technology.  We,  in  the  Northwest,  are  firm  believers  in  the  mate-
rial  end  of  the  equation,  as  Boeing  is  building  a  new  plane  that  is 
60 percent composite materials, which will be 30 percent more fuel 
efficient.  We  are  trying  to  put  our  foot  on  the  biodiesel  gas  pedal, 
as  it  relates  to  cellulosic  feedstock.  And  I  agree,  there’s  a  lot  that 
states, regions, and the national policy can do to expedite bringing 
true competition to the marketplace. Your notion of decreasing the 
demand  for  fossil  fuel  by  half  by  that  investment  is  encouraging. 
The question becomes: what do we do in the short-term? And Mr. 
West is, I think, articulating ‘‘wait until the markets correct them-
selves.’’ Is that right, Mr. West? 

Mr. WEST. No. 
Senator CANTWELL. OK. Good. 
Let  me  ask  you  this,  Mr.  West.  Following  up  on  my  colleague’s 
question,  do  you  think  there  is  enough  transparency  in  this  mar-
ket? 

Mr.  WEST.  I’m  not  a  specialist  in  this  area,  but  my  impression 
is  the  markets  are  quite  transparent.  I  think  the  FTC  has  inves-
tigated—they’ve  had  countless  investigations  in  this.  And  if  the 
market  is  not  transparent—I  mean,  I’m  all  for—I  believe  in  mar-
kets.  I  believe  in  transparent  markets.  I  don’t  think  you’re  going 
to—— 

Senator CANTWELL. Right, so can I—— 
Mr. WEST. With all due respect, I don’t think you’re going to get 

very—I don’t think you’re going to learn a great deal more. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Well,  you  know,  we  heard  the  same  thing 
about  the  western  energy  crisis  and  the  electricity  markets.  And, 
you know what? When we heard about gouging Grandma Milly, we

47 

found out a lot more about the electricity markets. And I think this 
Committee  ought  to  have  an  investigation  and  push  the  FTC  and 
push  every  avenue  we  have,  because  I’m  not  going  to  wait  for  the 
market to correct itself while people go bankrupt, people lose their 
pensions,  people  lose  their  jobs,  and  the  American  economy  is  ru-
ined.  I  mean,  at  what  price,  of  gasoline—$4,  $5  a  gallon—are  we 
going to do something about this? 

So,  my  question  for  you  is—this  past  week,  AAA,  hardly  an  ag-
gressive  organization  as  it  relates  to  putting  out  press  releases, 
spoke  on  behalf  of  various  gas-station  dealers  saying  that  they 
were forced by their parent company to raise the price 68 cents per 
gallon—this  is  post-Katrina—while  the  spot  market  in  other  areas 
had  the  price  lower.  So,  here  was  somebody  saying—the  spot  mar-
ket price was 68 cents lower, and now they’re getting an order from 
their oil company supplier to raise the price 68 cents above the spot 
market. Now, does that sound like transparency? 

Mr.  WEST.  Senator,  I’m  not  familiar  with  the  facts  on  this.  The 
one  thing  I  would  point  out,  generally,  though,  is  that  the  retail 
stations,  90  percent  of  which  are  not  owned  by  oil  companies—oil 
companies  can’t  tell  gas  stations,  unless  they—if  these  were  the 
company-owned  stations,  they  can  tell  them  to  raise  the  price.  If 
these are not company-owned stations—— 

Senator  CANTWELL.  They  were  company-owned—that  is  the 
point. This is the point. OK. I think the GAO has been right about 
this.  My  colleagues  from  Oregon,  both  Senator  Smith  and  Senator 
Wyden,  have  been  pushing  on  this  as  has  my  colleague  from  Cali-
fornia.  We’ve  got  conflicting  reports.  The  FTC  says,  ‘‘Yes,  these 
mergers, no big deal.’’ The GAO came back and said, ‘‘Oh, no, a big 
deal.’’  You  almost  have  a  oligopoly  here.  And,  as  you  just  said, 
when  you  have  an  oligopoly,  when  you  have  fewer  players,  they 
control  the  price.  So,  what’s  happening  is,  here’s  the  spot-market 
price. The spot market is the going-day price. Then you have these 
oil-company-owned stations, and they’re getting on the phone, say-
ing,  ‘‘Hey,  raise  the  price.‘‘  Now,  what  do  you  think  the  independ-
ents are going to do in that situation? So, they’re putting pressure 
on. 

Now,  we’ll  find  out.  That’s  why  I  think  this  committee  ought  to 
have  subpoena  power.  That’s  why  I  think  this  committee  ought  to 
go  after  this  issue.  Because  it’s  obvious  the  FTC  hasn’t  been  able 
to get the job done. But, just like in the western electricity market, 
we heard the same complaints, ‘‘It’s all about supply. It’s all about 
environmental rules.’’ And then when we found out there was a lot 
of market manipulation going on. 

So, I’m all for markets, too, but, by God, they’d better have trans-
parency. I don’t know what your thought is about at what point the 
gas  price  is  so  high  that  markets  aren’t  functioning.  Do  you  have 
a number? 

Mr. WEST. No, I don’t. I think there are—a couple of points. One, 
I  agree,  I  think  markets  should  be  transparent,  and  people  should 
be held accountable to the rules in the market. I’m not going to de-
fend that. 

I  think  one  of  the  things  that  it’s  important  to  recognize—and 
the  point  I’ve  tried  to  make  is  that  Katrina  should  be  seen  as  a 
wake-up  call.  Gasoline  prices  are  down  now,  I  think  I  saw  in  the 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  15:23 May 10, 2011 Jkt 066218 PO 00000 Frm 00051 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\66218.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

paper,  17  cents  or  something,  from  the  high.  But  the  fact  of  the 
matter is, unless certain actions are taken, you know, you’re going 
to  have  $4  gasoline,  you’re  going  to  have  $5  gasoline,  and  you’re 
going to have $6 gasoline, and—— 

Senator  CANTWELL.  And  at  what  point  will  you  say  the  market 

isn’t working? 

Mr.  WEST.  Oh,  I  think  it’s—this  is  a  global  commodity.  This  is 
what  I’m  trying  to  say.  And  it  will  be  reflected  in  cost.  And  it’s— 
this is—this is something—what I’m trying to say is that, in terms 
of  the  world  market,  the  oil  companies  do  not  set  the  price.  They 
are—in  economic  terms,  they’re  known  as  ‘‘price-takers.’’  They  are 
not  price-makers.  OK?  That’s  the  first  thing.  The  second  thing  is 
that, in terms of—a large portion of the gasoline price is crude oil. 
And  to  the  extent—so  that  that  input—and  that’s—that’s  just  a— 
with all due respect, Senator, that’s a fact. Now—and I think—you 
know,  the  question  is—and  I  think  we’re—my  colleague  on  the 
panel and I agree—is, you know, how do we get things in order so 
we  minimize  the  impact  of  that?  If  we  don’t  do  anything,  that’s 
what’s  going  to  happen,  I  believe.  And  I  don’t  think—I  think  it’s 
easy  to  blame  the  companies  and  to  say,  ‘‘There’s  a  great  con-
spiracy  and’’—I  just—I  mean,  there  is  a—for  a  number  of  reasons, 
it has been going on for a long time. There will be—— 

Senator CANTWELL. Mr. Chairman, I know my—— 
Mr. WEST.—shortages. I’m sorry. 
Senator  CANTWELL.—I  know  my  time  is  up,  but  I  think  we  are 
doing  our  part,  in  the  Northwest,  to  move  ahead.  But,  at  the  cur-
rent time, we have to protect consumers. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Pryor? 
Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr.  Bustnes,  let  me  ask  you  about  something.  I  keep  seeing  a 
fact  reported  over  and  over  and  over.  I  want  to  ask  you  if  it’s  true 
that the U.S. has not built a new refinery in 30 years. Is that true? 
Mr.  BUSTNES.  To  my  knowledge,  Senator,  that  is  roughly  true.  I 
can’t  tell  you  the  exact  number  of  years,  but  it’s  at  least  20  years. 
A new site. That said, capacity at existing sites have been expand-
ing, to Mr. West’s point earlier. 

Senator  PRYOR.  That’s  what  I  was  going  to  ask  you.  So,  even 
though  there  has  not  been  a  new  refinery,  our  capacity  has  in-
creased. Do you know what percentage it has increased? 
Mr. BUSTNES. I don’t, off the top of my head. Do you? 
Mr.  WEST.  The  numbers—it  went  from  15.1  million  to  17.1  mil-

lion in about an 8-year—a 10-year period, I think. 

Senator  PRYOR.  OK.  So,  I  guess  the  point  is  that  when  people— 
when  that  fact  is  reported—I  think  I  have  two  news  stories  here 
where it’s mentioned—that that’s not the complete story. Still, even 
though we don’t have new refinery sites, we do have more refining 
capacity. 

Mr. BUSTNES. That’s correct. 
Mr. WEST. I had—one other thing here is that the quality of the 
fuel coming out of the refineries is completely different than it was 
15 or 20 years ago, and—— 

Senator PRYOR. Higher quality——

Mr. WEST.—the standards are much higher. 
Senator PRYOR.—cleaner—— 
Mr. WEST. Yes. 
Senator PRYOR. Yes. 
Mr. WEST. And so, I think that it’s—I mean, as I say, the indus-
try’s—again,  say  what  you  like  about  the  industry,  but  they  have 
invested  a  lot  of  money  in  upgrading  and  de-bottlenecking,  they’ve 
created  more  capacity  with  the  existing  plant,  and  they’re  pro-
ducing a lot more cleaner fuel. 

Senator  PRYOR.  OK.  Mr.  Bustnes,  you  also  mentioned,  sort  of, 
three major factors for oil markets. One’s supply-and-demand. Two 
is risk factors. And three is the speculators. 

Mr. BUSTNES. Correct. 
Senator PRYOR. Are those equal factors, or is one more dominant 

than the other? 

tion, but I could speculate. 

Mr.  BUSTNES.  Senator,  I  can’t  tell  you  the  answer  to  that  ques-

[Laughter.] 
Senator PRYOR. All right, let’s hear you speculate. 
Mr.  BUSTNES.  And  the  speculation  I  would  have  would  be  that 
under  periods  of  stable  oil  prices,  where  we  have  a  good  supply- 
and-demand—fundamental  supply-and-demand  situation,  specula-
tion  tapers  off.  That’s  the—that’s  what  we’re  seeing.  And  why  is 
there  a  trillion  dollars  sloshing  around  today  on  speculation?  Be-
cause  we  have  an  extremely  tight/unstable  fundamental  situation. 
And  so,  that’s  the  way  I  look  back  in  history  and  see  that  picture. 
The  relative  size—well,  if  there—if  it’s  true  that  there  is  a  tril-
lion  dollars  moving—changing  hands  in  the  course  of  a  year  in 
speculation—to  put  that  in  perspective,  the  International  Energy 
Agency  says  that  over  the  next—I  think  it’s  over  the  next  30 
years—we need to invest $16 trillion in oil infrastructure and other 
energy infrastructure projects. Over the next 30 years. So, a trillion 
dollars a year is a big number. 

Senator PRYOR. Right. 
Mr. BUSTNES. Thank you. 
Senator PRYOR. Mr. West, do you have something to add to that? 
Mr. WEST. Speculators make money on movement. 
Senator PRYOR. Right. 
Mr. WEST. And if so, for the prices—they can make money if the 

price is going down—— 

Senator PRYOR. So, if there’s volatility—— 
Mr. WEST. Volatility is what they’re—— 
Senator PRYOR.—that’s where the—— 
Mr. WEST.—looking for. 
Senator PRYOR.—speculators come in. Right. 
Mr.  WEST.  And  because  of  the  risk  factor,  the  markets  are  very 

volatile.

Senator PRYOR. Right. OK. 
And,  Mr.  Bustnes,  let  me  ask  this.  You’re  familiar  with  the  ex-

Mr. BUSTNES. Yes, I am. 
Senator  PRYOR.  Senator  Cantwell,  here,  a  few—couple  of  weeks

think a lot of our colleagues did, as well. Can America do that? Can 
America make a commitment, say, over a couple of decades, to get 
to  an  energy-independence  level?  And,  based  on  your  testimony,  it 
sounds like you think the elements are there for us to do it, it just 
takes a national commitment. But I’d like to hear your thoughts on 
that. 

Mr. BUSTNES. Yes, the—thank you, Senator—the thoughts would 
be  as  follows.  The  case  of  Brazil  is  different  from  the  case  of  the 
United  States  of  America.  The  case  of  Brazil  is  one  where  one- 
quarter  of  their  current  gas—petroleum  gas-usage  equivalent  is 
provided by ethanol from sugarcane. 

Senator PRYOR. Right. 
Mr.  BUSTNES.  We  don’t  have  that  level  of  sugarcane  production 
in this country, and we never will. That said, though, the situation 
in  this  country  could  be  similar  to  Brazil,  if  we  really  wanted  to 
make  it  happen,  based  on  different  feedstocks.  We  wouldn’t  feed 
our biorefineries, if you will, sugarcane, but, rather, cellulosic feed-
stocks such as switchgrasses and poplar trees, willow trees, and so 
forth.  And  the  big  question  that  always  comes  up  is:  do  we  have 
enough  land  in  this  country  to  actually  produce  that  much  feed-
stocks?  And  the  short  answer  is  yes.  If  you  combine  the  correct 
technology—which,  over  the  next  few  years,  will  very  likely  prove 
to  be  gasification  with  Fischer  Tropsch  conversion  processes—with 
the right set of feedstocks, we could be at about a quarter of today’s 
liquid  fuel  needs  provided  by  this  cellulosic  ethanol  that  I’m  de-
scribing to you. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Senator Burns is gone. Senator Boxer? 
Senator BOXER. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
I  want  to  probe  a  little,  some  of  your—you’re  smiling,  Mr.  West, 
because you know that I was going to ask you a few things. When 
Senator Stevens relayed the point of when he worked in a gas sta-
tion, there was competition, the price would go down, and how the 
independents,  sometimes  their  hands  are  tied.  I’d  agree  with  that. 
They worry that they won’t have inventory. 

So, here’s the thing. I had my staff check. And I think it’s impor-
tant  to  note  that  in  California  we  only  have  15—15  percent  of  the 
gas  stations,  Mr.  Chairman,  are  owned  by  independents.  Only  15 
percent.  The  rest  are  owned  by  big  oil.  The  other  point  is,  this  is 
a  highly-concentrated  industry.  ConocoPhillips,  Exxon  Mobil,  BP, 
Valero, and ChevronTexaco own 50 percent of the U.S. refinery ca-
pacity.  These  same  oil  companies  own  the  stations.  So,  when  you 
say—and  excuse  me  for—you  know,  ‘‘the  poor  oil  companies’’— 
that’s, kind of, what I get from you—that they don’t set the price— 
that is untrue. In my State, they set the price, because they control 
everything. And, in addition, they love it. They don’t want more ca-
pacity. 

And  let  me  give  you  a  particular  case  in  point.  You  may  know 
about  it,  Mr.  West.  It’s  the  Bakersfield  Refinery,  owned  by  Shell. 
Shell wanted to shut it down. And the Congressional delegation, bi-
partisan, Senator Feinstein and I realized this would be terrible for 
consumers. We need to build more refineries, not close down exist-
ing refineries. OK? Shell’s answer, ‘‘We have no buyers.’’ ‘‘We have

no  buyers.’’  The  Attorney  General  of  the  State  of  California  went 
in—of course, the FTC—I tried to get them to do something. Noth-
ing.  But,  thank  goodness  we  had  an  attorney  general  there  that 
went.  And,  guess  what?  They  sold  it.  It’s  operational.  Shell  didn’t 
want  to  see  the  supply,  because  they  have  a  conflict  in  all  of  this, 
because of the vertical integration. 

I  wanted  to  talk  about  new  source  review,  which  the  President 
has  already—and  this  Senate  went  along—not  a  lot  of  us  on  this 
side  of  the  aisle—they’re  doing  away  with  it.  It’s  a  fairly  simple 
thing.  It  says,  if  you’re  going  to  pollute  more  by  expanding,  then 
clean up your act. 

And I guess my question to you is this, because we do have com-
peting interests here: the health of the people—the fact that, in Los 
Angeles, a baby born today has 20 percent less lung capacity there 
than  in  San  Francisco  because  of  air  pollution.  And  we’re  finally 
making  some  progress.  It  used  to  be  worse  than  that.  So,  I  guess 
my  question  to  you:  why  is  it  so  wrong  to  ask  these  giants,  who 
saw their profits go up in the first quarter of this year—80 percent 
for Conoco, and the others are right behind it—a little less, but 44 
percent, Exxon Mobil; BP, 29 percent; Shell, 28 percent—just in the 
first  quarter  of  2005—is  it  wrong,  in  your  opinion,  to  ask  these  gi-
ants,  who  are  having  record  profits,  to  clean  up  their  act  before 
they expand? 

Mr. WEST. A couple of points, Senator. I think that—I think that 
the industry should be expected to maintain a high standard. I am 
not in favor of children with low lung capacity in Los Angeles. Let 
me say that for the record. 

Senator BOXER. But you are in favor of repealing new source re-

Mr.  WEST.  No,  but  I  think  there  may  be  other  ways  to  manage 

view. 

that. I’m not an expert in—— 

Senator BOXER. Good. 
Mr. WEST.—this area. 
Senator BOXER. I’m happy to hear—— 
Mr. WEST. But I’m—— 
Senator BOXER.—you say that. 
Mr.  WEST.—for  the  record,  I’m  in  favor  of  clean  air.  But  let  me 
make  a  point.  You  know,  it  interests  me  that  you  point—you  dis-
cuss  the  profitability  of  the  industry.  And  I  think  it’s  very  impor-
tant to look at this industry, first over 10 or 15 years, and, second, 
relative to other industries. The—— 

Senator BOXER. Mr. West, I have so little time, I don’t have time 
to  look  at  this  industry  over  the  years.  We  are  called  here  by  our 
Chairman,  because  there’s  a  bit  of  a  crisis  going  on  right  now.  So, 
I’m looking at first-quarter profits. I’m just looking at—I’ve—please 
forgive  me,  because  I  want  to  move  on  and  ask  you  something 
about drilling in Alaska, that both my Chairman and my Co-Chair 
support very strongly. And they know I’m in a different place. They 
won. All right? So, we’re not re-fighting it. They won. 

I  want  to  ask  you  something.  You  say  how  important  it  is  to  in-
crease supply. I think we all agree, it’s a question of how it’s done. 
Now, would you—— 

Mr.  WEST.  I  think  it’s  also  very  important  to  deal  with  demand, 

as well. We—there’s no——

Senator BOXER. I know it is—— 
Mr. WEST.—disagreement between us here. 
Senator  BOXER.  You  said  that,  and  I’m  very  happy  about  that. 
And  I  think  we  all  agree—well,  at  least  I  hope  we  do—that  we 
need  to  do  work  on  both  sides  of  the  equation,  if  you  believe  sup-
ply-and-demand.  As  an  ‘‘old,’’  economics  major,  that’s  what  I  be-
lieve in, if it really works. 

So, I want to ask you this. Drilling in Alaska is controversial. It’s 
going  to  move  forward,  it  looks  like.  What  do  you  think  if—be-
cause—we’re  here  because  we’re  worried  about  our  consumers.  If 
that  oil  is  exported,  do  you  think  we  should  think  about—because 
we  once  did  say,  ‘‘We  have  to  sell  it  here  in  America,  rather  than 
export it to Japan or China or elsewhere.’’ Do you have any feeling 
on that? 

I just want to ask his opinion. 
Mr. WEST. My sense is, frankly, Senator, that it—the oil market 
is a world market. I don’t think it’s going to make much difference. 
If  it  makes  you  feel  better,  in  California,  to  bring  it  to  California, 
then  you  can  do  so.  It  may  cause  distortions  in  the  market.  But  I 
don’t—I don’t think that’s the critical issue. 

One  of  the  things  that’s  important  to  keep  in  mind  is  that  the 
United  States  is  the  only  country  that  I’m  aware  of—and  I’m—fol-
low this quite closely—there is drilling in the fishing waters of Nor-
way,  there  is  drilling  in  the  Paris  Basin,  and  there  is  drilling  in 
the  countryside  of  England.  We  are  the  only  country,  the  only  de-
veloped  country—and  those  countries,  I  might  add—Norway,  The 
Netherlands,  France,  U.K.—their  scene  is  much  more  developed, 
environmentally,  than  we  are,  and  much  more  sophisticated.  But 
they  drill  in  areas  which  we  would  not  be  permitted  to  drill  in,  in 
the United States. And I just think that it’s important to recognize 
that  there  are  certain  standards  which,  I  think,  the  industry  can 
realistically meet, and I don’t think the industry has been credited 
for it. 

Senator  BOXER.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  know  my  time  is  up.  Could  I 

just finish, in 30 seconds, if I might? 

The CHAIRMAN. Sure. 
Senator BOXER. Thank you so much. 
On  the  drilling  question,  there’s  more  to  the  economy  than  just 
energy.  There  are  other  things  that  happen  in  states.  In  my  state, 
the  number  one  industry  is  tourism.  People  come  for  the  beauty. 
So,  there  are  lots  of  different  competing  interests.  And  when  you 
say—and  I  love  it,  because  I  know  you  were  in  Ronald  Reagan’s 
Administration—you  say,  ‘‘It’s  wonderful  that  the  Federal  Govern-
ment  voted  to  overstep  the  states  and  allow  the  Federal  Govern-
ment  to  place  LNG  terminals.’’  And  you  mentioned  something  else 
you thought was good that we ought to do, where we would—— 

Mr. WEST. I said that there’s a national energy need. And I think 
that local interests have to recognize that national need. That’s all 
I said, Senator. 

Senator  BOXER.  Well,  you  said  it  was  a  good  thing.  I  just  think 

it’s interesting. 

Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Allen?

Senator  ALLEN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you  to  both 
our  witnesses.  Very  good  insight  from  a  variety  of  perspectives.  I 
do  think  we  do  need  to  look  at  alternatives—alternatives,  includ-
ing,  I  would—in  addition  to  the  biofuels  and  the  advanced  mate-
rials,  and  the  research  that’ll  be  going  forward  in  nanotechnology, 
which  will  affect  materials  engineering—stronger,  lighter  mate-
rials—and also in the—and making, I think, solar—or solar photo-
voltaic more available in that regard. 

Mr.  Bustnes,  what  do  you—do  you  have  any  comments  on  coal? 

Coal diesel? We are the Saudi Arabia of the world in coal. 

Mr.  BUSTNES.  Yes,  we  are,  Senator.  That  is  correct,  relatively 
speaking.  We  have  a  lot  of  coal  here.  And  my  overview  on  coal,  I 
guess,  would  be  fairly  simple.  I  think  it  is  a  resource  that,  if  we 
can manage it, put it to use, in a way that deals with the air-qual-
ity  issues,  and  so  forth,  that  we  have  already  heard  discussion  of, 
I  don’t  see  any  reason  why  we  should  not  deploy  that  resource  as 
long as we can manage it in a way that makes sense for the health 
of the people in the country. 

Senator  ALLEN.  All  right,  but,  yes  or  no,  do  you  see  that  the 
promise  of,  say,  a  coal  diesel—Germany  has  used  it,  South  Africa 
has used it. We’re not going to—— 

Mr.  BUSTNES.  Absolutely,  Senator.  I  think  that’s—that  is  clearly 

in the deck of cards of alternative fuels. 

Senator  ALLEN.  All  right.  Now,  let  me  get—this  whole  refinery 
issue  is  a  big  issue.  So  is  how  we  use  a  clearly,  valuable  resource, 
oil  and  natural  gas.  It  can  be  used  in  a  variety  of  fronts.  There— 
you  could  say  that  we’re  at  world  capacity,  and  there  are  some— 
I think Kazakhstan, and Alaska, and Africa, and elsewhere, we can 
get  more  oil  and  natural  gas.  The  question  is:  where  are  we  using 
this? It should be used, in my view, in manufacturing, particularly 
the  natural  gas—clean-burning  natural  gas—and  for  transpor-
tation.  There’s  a  percentage—I  don’t  know  what  it  is—but  it  is 
used  for  generating  electricity.  And  when  you’re  using  oil  or  nat-
ural  gas  for  generating  electricity,  it’s  like  using  bottled  water  to 
wash  dishes.  It’s  a  great  resource  that  we  need  for  transportation, 
for our economy, for heating our homes. And you add—this is why 
I  talk  about  electricity  being  generated  with  nuclear  or  clean  coal. 
Now,  refinery  capacity.  Sure,  there  are  fewer  refineries.  They 
have greater capacity. But are they meeting demand? From the En-
ergy  Committee,  we  had—that,  sure,  demand  is—capacity  is  up, 
but  demand  is  far  outpacing  the  capacity  of  our  refineries.  Is  that 
not true? All right, nodding yes. Inducing that. 

Now, back to the issue of all these different specialty fuels. If we 
took—and  there’s  supposedly  over  50—and  we’re  going  to  hear 
from  Mr.  Wells,  with  the  Government  Accountability  Office—there 
are  supposedly,  over  a  hundred  different  fuel  blends,  maybe  50  or 
a  hundred—if  we  took  the  top  three,  top  five,  cleanest-burning 
fuels—say,  for  the  Los  Angeles  area,  Washington,  D.C.,  Atlanta, 
Philadelphia,  New  York—and  said  to  localities  in  nonattainment 
areas,  ‘‘Pick  one  of  those  three  for  your  area,’’  as  opposed  to  all  of 
them  having  these  different  ones.  And  you  just  choose.  It’s  their 
choice.  And  then,  in  the  areas  that  do  have  air  quality—good  air 
quality,  they  wouldn’t  have  to  be  in  these  reformulated  fuels. 
Would  that  not  help  us  with  our  refinery  capacity,  which  is  really

going  at  full-bore?  And  would  it  not  also  reduce  the  cost  of  gaso-
line? 

Mr. West, could you share your—— 
Mr.  WEST.  Yes,  Senator.  I  would  agree.  The  only  thing  I  would 
say  is  to  make  sure  that  the  standards  are  contiguous  to  each 
other,  so  that  they  are—you  can  move  the—the  key  thing  is  to  be 
able to move the product around between markets. And what you— 
I  think  you’re—what  you’re  proposing  is  excellent,  and  I  think  it’s 
just—as  I  say,  it’s  important  that  you  be  able  to  have—this  is  a 
fungible commodity, that you can move it as much as possible. 

Senator  ALLEN.  Well,  I  wouldn’t  say  that  you’d  have  Fairfax 
County  having  a  different  fuel  than  the—Washington,  D.C.  The 
whole  nonattainment  region  would  have  that  same  fuel.  The  At-
lanta  area,  all  the  counties  around  Atlanta  would  have  it.  The 
counties  in  New  Jersey  and  Pennsylvania,  around  Philadelphia, 
would have that. 

Mr. WEST. I think it’s an excellent idea. I—— 
Mr. BUSTNES. Could I add something to record—— 
Senator ALLEN. Sure. 
Mr. BUSTNES.—just regarding coal? When I say ‘‘clean coal,’’ I do 
mean,  also,  climate-neutral  coal.  I  do  believe  that  most  of  us  here 
in the room would agree that there is a risk of climate change. And 
I would like to just point out that, in the case of coal, if you convert 
the  coal  unfettered,  if  you  will,  as  we  do  today,  and  take  it  from 
the  ground  and  put  it  into  the  atmosphere,  that  conversion,  the 
coal  that  we  know  of  today,  would  raise  the  CO2 concentrations  in 
the atmosphere probably by a factor of three. And this is a serious 
issue, given that, generally, it’s thought that raising it by 20 to 30 
percent  would  seriously  destabilize—unstabilize,  if  you  will,  the 
current climate. 

Senator  ALLEN.  Understood.  That’s  why  I  always  use  the  term 
clean  coal  technology,  not  just  burning  coal,  as  is.  And  it’ll  take 
more  processing  to  do  that,  but  it  is  a  fuel  source  that  we  have  in 
this  country.  And,  with  advances  in  technology,  I  believe  it  can  be 
done. And, with these high prices, which are likely to stay, because 
of  the  demands  from  India,  China,  and  other  growing  countries,  a 
lot of these alternatives do now make economic sense. 

Thank  you.  My  time  is  up,  and  I  appreciate  it,  Mr.  Chairman, 

and our witnesses. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Smith? 
Senator SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Gentlemen,  thank  you  both  for  being  here.  Your  testimony  is 

very illuminating. 

I  have  a  number  of  questions,  so  I  would  ask  you  to  keep  your 
answers short, because I’m trying to learn about this. It is my per-
ception that increases in gasoline and aviation fuel are rising faster 
than crude prices. Is that correct, or not? 

Mr.  WEST.  I  think  it  depends—right  after  Katrina,  yes.  Now  it’s 
falling.  I  mean,  it’s—the  market  can  be  more  volatile  than  crude 
markets. 

Senator SMITH. So, it is a consequence of the market responding 
to  an  emergency  or  a  catastrophe,  and  that  the  market  will  soon 
correct that. Is that your understanding?

55 

Mr. WEST. Yes, sir. 
Senator SMITH. It seems to me that the wholesale and the retail 
price of gasoline is also widening. Why is that? And will the market 
correct that? 

Mr. WEST. The market should correct it, yes. 
Senator SMITH. Are they, in fact, widening? 
Mr. WEST. I honestly don’t know the answer to that, Senator. 
Senator  SMITH.  Can  the  market  correct  it,  if  Senator  Boxer’s 
point is accurate, that these companies are so vertically integrated 
now  that  they  have  no  interest  in  correcting  it?  We’re  not  talking 
about crude from abroad. We’re talking about a West Coast supply, 
in  particular,  that  is  vertically  integrated  to  the  point  where  there 
is no incentive, any longer, to correct it. 

Mr.  WEST.  Senator,  I—my  impression  is  that  the—for  example, 
the  California  gas  business  is  a  pretty  competitive  business,  and 
it’s  a  tough  business,  and,  at  times,  has  been  a  very  low-margin 
business,  and  that  there  may  be  certain  distortions  going  on  right 
now.  But,  generally,  I  think  the  market  corrects  itself,  and  that  it 
is competitive. 

Senator SMITH. Do you believe—— 
Mr. WEST. Senator Boxer doesn’t look like she agrees. 
Senator  SMITH.  Does  the  FTC  track  both  the  wholesale  and  the 
retail  price?  Do  they  have  the  power  do  that,  and  are  they  doing 
that? 

Mr. WEST. I think they do it when they’re asked to do it. I don’t 

know that they do it all the time. 

The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Bustnes, I was very interested in your testi-
mony  about  cellulosics,  and  other  alternatives  to  ethanol.  Can  you 
elaborate on that? Can you tell me why is—are wood products bet-
ter than corn products or other farm products? 

Mr.  BUSTNES.  I  think  the  short  answer,  Senator,  would  be  that, 
basically, there is less of a need for input energy to generate these 
woody plants, point number one. Point number two, the conversion 
technologies,  if  you  will,  that  are  either  pre-commercial,  or  in  the 
R&D  pipeline,  promise  an  extraordinarily  high  yield  compared  to 
today’s levels. And—— 

Senator SMITH. Higher than corn? 
Mr. BUSTNES. Yes, sir, significantly higher than corn. And, third, 
you  can  use  the  whole  plant.  In  the  case  of  corn,  you  use  a  teeny 
amount,  truly,  right?  If  you  take  the  stalk  and  the—et  cetera. 
So—— 

Senator SMITH. The recovery is very—— 
Mr. BUSTNES. Yes. 
Senator SMITH.—very low. 
Mr.  BUSTNES.  So,  the  actual—of  the  total  mass  moved  and  har-
vested,  and  so  forth,  not  only  does  corn  take  a  large  quantity  of 
water and fertilizer, unlike some of these other feedstocks, you can 
also use only a very small part of that plant. 

Senator SMITH. So, does it have to do with the waste, versus the 

material that actually is produced? 

Mr. BUSTNES. Yes. 
Senator SMITH. Did we do enough in the energy bill, as you read 
it,  for  biomass,  and  cellulosics,  in  particular?  Is  it  going  to  work, 
in your view, to provide the infrastructure to use this resource?

56 

Mr. BUSTNES. I don’t want to comment specifically on the energy 
bill.  I  believe  there  is  now  some  insignificant  funding  for  cellulosic 
ethanol.  The  way  I  would  probably  look  at  it,  though,  if  I  were 
making  some  thoughts  about  cellulosic  ethanol,  is,  I  would  take  a 
portfolio  approach,  Senator,  and  I  would  actively  pursue  multiple 
pathways,  and  of  which  there  are  multiple  pathways,  to  get  there. 
Senator SMITH. Mr. Bustnes, in your testimony, and also in other 
publications  for  your  Institute,  you’ve  talked  about  the  automobile 
industry  and  the  retooling  that  needs  to  be  done.  You’ve  indicated 
in  those  publications  that  the  industry  needs  to  spend  $90  billion 
for composites and new technologies. Is that accurate? 

Mr.  BUSTNES.  That  figure,  Senator,  is  including  automobile, 

heavy trucking, and aircraft industries. 

Senator  SMITH.  In  your  opinion,  are  the  domestic  automakers 

moving in this direction? 

Mr.  BUSTNES.  I  guess  I  would  have  to  answer  a  maybe  to  that. 
It’s  very  hard,  sometimes,  to  tell,  in  very  large  corporations,  what 
exactly is going on under the hoods, Senator. But—— 

Senator SMITH. I don’t want to tell them what to do, but I’ve got 
to  tell  them  that  we  have  an  emergency  going  on  here.  Frankly,  I 
have  often  voted  for  CAFE-standard  increases,  while  acknowl-
edging  they’re  a  fairly  clumsy  instrument.  And  the  auto  dealers 
hate  it,  too.  Have  you  seen  another  model  for  driving  this  effi-
ciency,  other  than  just  the  market?  I  don’t  know  how  long  we  can 
wait,  given  the  emergency  we  have  in  energy.  Is  there  a  better 
model  than  CAFE  standards  that  you  have  seen  or  would  rec-
ommend? 

Mr.  BUSTNES.  I  would  have  to  say  probably,  unequivocally,  yes, 
but  let  me  caveat  that  answer  first.  The  caveat  is  that  CAFE 
standards  can  be,  if  managed  on  a  continuous  basis,  useful.  Now, 
the alternative framework that we actually proposed, in our study, 
is  a  framework  that  is  based  on  feebates  as  an  instrument  of  pol-
icy.  And  feebates  are  simple,  Senator.  They  basically  work  on  a 
class-based  method.  And  each  class,  all  vehicles—and  this  is  basi-
cally  designed  this  way  so  that  you  end  up  not  having  to  choose 
a small car. If you want a big car, that’s OK, but the feebate sched-
ule  for  each  of  these  classes  of  vehicles  basically  encourage  you  to 
buy  the  efficient  large  vehicle,  and  it  penalizes  you,  if  you  will— 
and  those  penalties,  those  fees,  finance  the  rebates  to  those  cus-
tomers  that  would—and  the  net  effect  is  very  important,  Senator. 
It  would  correct  a  market  failure  that  we  see  today.  So,  when  you 
and I—— 

Senator SMITH. We do that through tax policy, not to drive indus-

trial policy. 

Mr. BUSTNES. This—oh—— 
Senator SMITH. Is that what you’re suggesting? 
Mr. BUSTNES. I am—— 
Senator SMITH. I’m sorry. My time is up. 
Mr. BUSTNES.—I am suggesting that there is such an instrument 

out there, and I’d be happy to—— 

Senator  SMITH.  Well,  I  would  appreciate  it,  and  I  think  many  of 
my colleagues would, too. I think we need to do something. I think 
we  need  to  revisit  this  component  of  the  energy  bill.  But,  frankly,

I’d like a better model than CAFE standards, because I think that 
they’re a clumsy model. 

Mr.  BUSTNES.  Very  short—if  I  may  add,  on  this  instrument—it 
encourages  continuous  adoption  of  new  technology  in  a  very  dif-
ferent way from what we see today. 

Thank you very much. Sorry to—— 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Senator Snowe? 

STATEMENT OF HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE 

Senator SNOWE. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Just to continue that discussion, because I am a leading sponsor 
of  the  initiative  with  Senator  Feinstein,  with  respect  to  improving 
fuel efficiency—it’s long overdue. I mean, we now get the lowest of 
fuel  efficiency  standards  since  1980,  the  equivalent.  At  that  time, 
we  were  just  off  the  heels  of  the  gasoline  and  energy  crisis  that 
produced  the  long  lines  for  an  extended  period  of  time.  That  was 
a  very  wrenching  period  for  this  country  and  for  American  con-
sumers.  So,  here  we  are  today,  ironically,  less—you  know,  maybe 
several months since we passed an energy policy that, frankly, did 
not  embody  any  efforts  for  conservation,  limited  provisions  that  I 
included  with  respect  to  incentives  for  fuel  efficiency—I  mean,  for 
efficiency  standards  in  commercial  and  residential  buildings.  So, 
we created, for the first time, in our energy policy, separate energy- 
efficiency incentives with a tax component. But here we are today, 
not  having  done  anything  in  that  energy  package  to  significantly 
reduce our ability for our dependency on imported oil and consump-
tion  and  demand.  And  fuel  efficiency  is  clearly  one  major  step  in 
that  direction.  In  fact,  Business  Week,  online,  released  a  column, 
and it said that—you know, that we rank dead last when it comes 
to the gap between us and our trading partners. China, Japan, and 
Europe  continue  to  raise  mileage  standards.  And  the  Pew  Center 
on  Global  Climate  Change  that  normalized  mileage  rules  in  top 
auto  markets,  U.S.  rules  rank  dead  last,  and  the  gap  only  widens 
as scheduled hikes overseas take effect. 

So, we see what the impact has been on the automakers, because 
their  unwillingness  to  adopt  something  forward-thinking.  Nothing 
was  immediate.  It  was  incremental.  It  was  reasonable  to  go  up  to 
27  miles  per  gallon  for,  you  know,  SUVs,  ultimately,  when  they’re 
consuming—you  know,  the  transportation  sector’s  consuming  42 
percent,  you  know,  of  our  consumption  of  petroleum  in  this  coun-
try.  So,  this  is  problematic  that  we’re  at  this  point  now,  because 
anything  we  do  isn’t  going  to  affect  the  demand  and  our  position 
overnight.  And  yet  it  should  have  been  incorporated  in  our  policy 
long ago. And our consumers are bearing the brunt of that because 
of the failure to reach that consensus. 

Is  there  anything  that  we  can  do  within  the  next  year,  or  two, 
to  reduce  demand  when  we  discuss  short-term?  Is  there  any— 
what’s ‘‘short-term’’? I mean, is that a year? Two years? Five years? 
Mr.  WEST.  The  lead  times  in  this  industry  are  very  long.  And  I 
think—also,  you  have  a  massive  investment  in  the  transportation 
stock,  the  capital  stock,  all  the  cars  in  the  country.  So,  it’s  going

to  take  a  long,  long  time.  I  think  the  feebates  idea  is  a  very  inter-
esting idea. 

One  concept  I’d  like  to  put  forward,  though,  that  I  think  is  very 
important, and that is that structural demand in the United States 
has changed. One of the things that has transformed the U.S. econ-
omy  is  the  rise  of  the  suburbs,  and  the  exurbs,  in  the  last  20  or 
25  years.  And  people  live  and  work  and  recreate  in  their  cars  in 
ways that they never have before, and that the suburbs were real-
ly—creation  of  the  suburbs  were  driven  by  cheap  land,  cheap  en-
ergy,  cheap  credit,  and  the  Federal  Highway  Bill  and—plus  the 
American  dream.  And  it  represents  trillions  of  dollars  of  invest-
ment.  And,  furthermore,  it  is  the  real-estate  business  which  has 
given  the  consumer  a  sense  of  wealth,  which  has  driven  the  econ-
omy.  The  consumer  is  70  percent  of  the  economy,  which  is—in 
turn, the U.S. economy is the flywheel of the world economy. 

So,  I  think  whatever  steps  you  take,  you  have  to  be  very,  very 
careful. And what is interesting, I think, about a lot of the sugges-
tions  that  have  been  made,  they’re  going  to  take  a  while.  They’re 
going to take a while. 

Senator  SNOWE.  I  know.  We  would  understand  that.  That’s  why 
it  was  not  so  unreasonable  to  put  in  place  at  least  these  improve-
ments in efficiency standards. 

Mr. WEST. Oh, I’m all in favor of—— 
Senator  SNOWE.  I  mean,  I  just  didn’t  have—I’ve  never  under-
stood  the  resistance.  It  was  modest.  It  was  doable.  The  industry 
was in a good position to adopt them over a period of time, so we’d 
be  well  on  our  way.  We’ve  been  trying  for  many  years  now  to  get 
them incorporated. We just passed an energy bill in June, and here 
we are talking today about: what can we do to improve our energy 
conservation and reduce demand and consumption? 

Mr. WEST. Can I—— 
Senator SNOWE. It hardly makes sense. We’re supposed to extend 

the vision—— 

Mr. WEST. One—— 
Senator SNOWE.—for America, but—— 
Mr.  WEST.—words  that  are  used  interchangeably  is  ‘‘efficiency’’ 
and  ‘‘conservation.’’  And  they’re  not  the  same.  And  there’s  one 
slight problem with efficiency. The more efficient you make energy, 
the more people will use it. We must also conserve. 

Senator  SNOWE.  Well,  I  wouldn’t—I  wouldn’t  disagree  with  that, 

but we have to create incentives—— 

Mr. WEST. Oh, I agree. 
Senator  SNOWE.—on  both  sides  of  the  equation,  and  we  have  ig-
nored  a  very  important  part.  What  I  find  immensely  ironic  now  is 
that, you know, you’ve got China that’s moving ahead. And, accord-
ing to this article, which I think is interesting, Beijing recently un-
veiled  mileage  goals  that  are  22  percent  more  demanding  than  to-
day’s  U.S.  levels,  and  should  be  35  percent  stricter  still  coming  in 
in 2008. 

Mr. WEST. Senator, the Chinese just put high taxes on inefficient 
luxury  vehicles.  I  mean,  they’re,  kind  of,  taking  part  of  the  lesson 
here. So, the Chinese are actually starting to act, as a—— 

Senator  SNOWE.  Well,  I  just  don’t  understand  why—what  we 

don’t get.

Mr. BUSTNES. Senator, let me add to these comments just a very 
short—there  are  immediate  things  that  we  could  do—and  I’d  be 
happy  to  cough  up  a  list  for  you,  after  this  testimony  is  over,  and 
forward it to you—that basically would focus on immediate demand 
reduction,  things  that  wouldn’t  impede,  let’s  say,  on  getting  to  the 
suburbs,  or  whatever  you  have.  So,  I  would  be  happy  to  work  up 
a list for you. 

Senator SNOWE. I would appreciate that. Thank you. 
[The information referred to is contained in the appendix.] 
Mr.  WEST.  One  other  area  that’s  very  important  to  recognize  is 
that an enormous source of demand for diesel in the United States 
is  the  trucking  sector.  And  if  there  are  ways  to  move  more  freight 
by  rail  than  by  diesel,  this  is  something  which  may  be  able  to  be 
affected fairly quickly and would be significant. 

Senator SNOWE. OK, thank you. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Unfortunately,  I  have  an  appointment.  And  Senator  Inouye  will 
chair  now  for  the  balance  of  this  morning.  And  it’s  my  under-
standing  you  want  to  move  on  to  the  next  panel  after  yielding  a 
couple  of  minutes  to  Senator  Boxer  and  Senator  Cantwell.  Is  that 
correct? 

Senator INOUYE. Yes. 
The CHAIRMAN. But I would urge you to try and finish this morn-

ing. We do have two panels this afternoon, also. 

Thank you very much. 
Senator INOUYE. I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
I’d like to yield 2 minutes to Senator Cantwell. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Just  a  question. 

So you’re going to reconvene, then, at—— 

Senator INOUYE. At 2 o’clock. 
Senator CANTWELL. We’re going to break—thank you. 
Senator INOUYE. At 2 o’clock—— 
Senator INOUYE. Thank you. 
Senator INOUYE.—we’ll have—— 
The  CHAIRMAN.  We  will  reconvene  at  2  o’clock  for  the  next  two 

panels, as scheduled. 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you. 
Mr.  West,  if  I  could  go  back  to  the  transparency  question,  and 
this particular aspect of pricing, are you concerned about the vola-
tility of this market? 

Mr.  WEST.  I  think  the  volatility  is  inevitable  right  now,  because 
markets are so tight, there are risks—and there are risk factors in 
there.  I—one  of  the  points  that  my  colleague  made,  but  also  I 
would—— 

Senator CANTWELL. Since I only have a couple of—— 
Mr. WEST. OK. At any rate, it’s—— 
Senator  CANTWELL.—only  have  2  minutes—so,  you  think  it’s  in-
evitable.  Do  you  think  that  the  CFTC  and  the  FTC  have  enough 
investigative powers to investigate that volatility? 

Mr.  WEST.  I’m—I  would  assume  so,  but  I’m  really  not  an  expert 
in  that.  I  mean,  I  really—with  all  due  respect,  I  can’t  answer  that 
question.

Senator CANTWELL. I can’t think of any other area of futures that 
has  as  much  volatility  as  this  does,  and  I  can’t  think  of  any  com-
pany  in  my  state  that  trades,  you  know,  on  the  NASDAQ  that 
would  get  away  with  this  much  volatility  without  an  SEC  inves-
tigation.  If  you  would  look  at  that  and  give  us  more  detailed  spe-
cifics. 

Why aren’t we seeing more long-term contracts on oil price? 
Mr. WEST. Again, it’s the volatility of the market. I mean, I think 
people—the markets are seen as being extremely efficient, and peo-
ple—you have—don’t forget you have—— 

Senator CANTWELL. Efficient? 
Mr.  WEST.—you  have  suppliers.  Can  they  manage  their  inven-
tory,  based  on  this?  And  then  you’ve  got,  basically,  traders.  And 
you  really  have  two  classes  of  people  who  use  the  market.  And  I 
think the market works for them and their requirements now. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  I’m  sorry,  who  is  the  market  working  for? 
Because  I  know  a  lot  of  people  that  are  being  impacted.  And  so, 
I—— 

Mr.  WEST.  No,  No,  what  I’m  trying  to  say—but  the  consumer  is 
not  in  the  commodities  market.  The  two  players,  primarily,  in  the 
commodities  market  are,  one,  basically  people  who  need  the  phys-
ical  oil,  the  oil  companies,  the  refiners.  And  then  the  other  group 
are  commodities  traders.  And  they  manage  it  for  different  pur-
poses.  But  they  have—you  know,  they  manage  their  risks  dif-
ferently. 

Senator CANTWELL. So, do you think that the market should see 
more  long-term  contracts?  I  mean,  when  Southwest  can  basically 
come  in  and  finance  oil  at  $26  a  barrel,  juxtaposed  to  what’s  hap-
pening  on  the  spot  market  any  given  day,  from  $60  to  almost  $70 
a barrel, there’s a huge difference. 

Mr. WEST. Oh, and it’s being able to manage this risk, and being 
willing to take those risks. That’s an element of risk management. 
And risk management is a big part of this business now. 

Senator CANTWELL. Risk—I’m sorry? 
Mr. WEST. Price risk management. 
Senator CANTWELL. The risk at—— 
Mr. WEST. I mean, as you say, on Southwest—— 
Senator CANTWELL.—$26 a barrel is—— 
Mr. WEST.—versus the risk at $60 a barrel. 
Senator CANTWELL. What’s the risk at $26 a barrel? 
Mr.  WEST.  Well,  the  risk  was—I  mean,  there  are  other  compa-
nies that did not go into the market and take those same positions. 
And,  basically,  Southwest  was  prepared  to  do  that,  and  others 
weren’t. And others may have been—either didn’t have the balance 
sheet  to  be  able  to  do  it,  or  they  felt  the  price  might  go  lower  and 
they’d get squeezed. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  I  see  my  time  is  up,  Mr.  Chairman.  But  if 
you  could  get  back  to  us,  Mr.  West,  on  any  changes  to  the  FTC  or 
CFTC as it relates to transparency, that would be great. 

Mr. WEST. Yes. 
Senator INOUYE. Thank you. 
Senator BOXER. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
OK,  I’m  going  to  talk  fast,  because,  Mr.  West,  you  reminded  me 
of something. And what I want to do is two comments and then two 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  15:23 May 10, 2011 Jkt 066218 PO 00000 Frm 00064 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\66218.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

61 

questions  to  both  of  you,  if  you  could  each  answer  yes  or  no,  be-
cause they’re easy questions. 

OK,  here’s  the  comment.  Something  you  said,  Mr.  West,  re-
minded  me  of  my  beautiful  late  mom.  When  I  was  a  kid,  there 
was—— 

Mr. WEST. I’m flattered. 
Senator  BOXER.  Yes,  you  should  be  very  flattered.  When  I  was 
a  child,  I  lived  in  an  apartment  building,  and  there  was  a  girl  up-
stairs,  her  name  was  Sheila.  Sheila  got  everything.  And  so,  any-
time I wanted something from my mother that my mother wouldn’t 
give  me,  I’d  say,  ‘‘Mom,  Sheila  can  stay  up  to  midnight.  Why  can’t 
I?’’ And then she’d look at me, she’d say, ‘‘No.’’ Then I’d say, ‘‘Sheila 
wears  lipstick.  Why  can’t  I?’’  And  she’d  be  quiet.  Then  finally  one 
day  she  had  had  it  with  the  questions,  and  she  said,  ‘‘If  Sheila 
jumped off the bridge, would you?’’ And when you said, ‘‘The Neth-
erlands  allows  drilling.  Norway  allows  drilling.  Places  in  Europe— 
and they’re so great, and we don’t.’’ 

So,  my  point  is,  this  is  America,  and  we  are  different,  just  like 
I  was  different  from  Sheila,  and  my  mother  was  different  from 
Sheila’s mother. There are values here that are involved, and there 
are  economics  involved.  Our  fishery  industry  is  against  it.  Our 
tourist industry is against it. Our people are against it. Our Repub-
lican  Governor  is  against  it.  Everyone’s  against  it.  So,  therefore,  I 
would  hope  we  can  keep  that  decision  with  the  Federal  Govern-
ment,  with  the  states  in  mind.  And  I  think  that’s  very  important. 
That’s the first comment. 

The  second.  I  wanted  to  comment  that  if  we  just  allowed  the 
SUVs  to  get  the  same—if  we  forced  them  to  get  the  same  mileage 
as  the  rest  of  the  fleet,  on  average,  28  or  whatever  it  is,  we  would 
have  one  ANWR  every  7  years.  So,  I’m  curious  as  to  whether  or 
not you agree with that. So, that’s a question. I want you to answer 
yes or no. 

And  then  I  want  you  to  answer  yes  or  no  to  this,  both.  You  be-
lieve  in  free  markets,  Mr.  West.  Did  you  agree  or  disagree  with 
President  Bush’s  decision,  that  I  supported,  to  go  to  the  SPR,  and 
release 30 million barrels in an unspecified amount in a swap? Did 
you  agree  or  disagree?  Because  that  does  interfere  with  supply- 
and-demand. 

And those are my two questions. 
Mr. WEST. Yes and yes. 
Senator BOXER. OK. 
Mr.  BUSTNES.  I  would  need  to  rerun  the  numbers,  Senator,  but 

yes and also—— 

Mr. WEST. Assuming your numbers are correct, yes and yes. 
Mr. BUSTNES.—also yes. 
Senator BOXER. I got them straight out of—— 
Mr. BUSTNES. Yes. Yes. 
Senator  BOXER.—the  Bush  Administration,  30  million  barrels 

and an unspecified amount was swapped. 

Mr. BUSTNES. Terrific. The answer is yes. 
Senator BOXER. Thank you. 
Senator  INOUYE.  Mr.  West,  Mr.  Bustnes,  on  behalf  of  the  Com-
mittee,  I  thank  you  very  much  for  your  patience  and,  personally,

would  like  to  get  together  with  you  again.  Obviously,  we  are  con-
cerned, just as much as you are. 

Mr. WEST. I’m sure we’d be happy to meet—— 
Senator INOUYE. Something has to be done. 
Mr. WEST. Be happy to, sir. 
Mr. BUSTNES. Be happy to. 
Senator INOUYE. So, with that, may I call upon Mr. John Seesel, 
Associate  General  Counsel  for  Energy  of  the  FTC,  and  Jim  Wells, 
Director of Energy, Resources, Science Issues of the GAO? 

Mr. Seesel and Mr. Wells, we welcome you, and we apologize for 

this lateness, but we will be here, because it is important. 

May  I  now  call  upon  the  Associate  General  Counsel  for  his  re-

marks? 

STATEMENT OF JOHN H. SEESEL, ASSOCIATE GENERAL 
COUNSEL FOR ENERGY, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 

Mr.  SEESEL.  Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman  and  members  of  the 
Committee.  I  am  John  Seesel,  the  Associate  General  Counsel  for 
Energy  at  the  Federal  Trade  Commission.  I  am  pleased  to  have 
this  opportunity  to  discuss  the  FTC’s  actions  to  promote  competi-
tion  in  the  petroleum  industry  and  to  protect  consumers  who  use 
gasoline,  diesel,  and  the  other  petroleum  products  so  vital  to  our 
Nation’s economy. 

I  want  to  re-emphasize  what  I  told  the  House  Energy  and  Com-
merce Committee 2 weeks ago. The FTC fully shares in the terrible 
shock  and  sadness  that  the  Nation  has  experienced,  since  Hurri-
cane Katrina wrought such tragic devastation in the Gulf Coast re-
gion.  We,  as  an  agency,  are  doing  all  that  we  can  within  our  com-
petition and consumer-protection missions to assist the victims and 
to aid in recovery efforts. 

Today’s  hearing  focuses  on  one  of  the  truly  critical  issues  facing 
the United States and the world in coming decades: the price of en-
ergy.  I  want  to  assure  this  committee  that  the  FTC  is  acutely 
aware  of  the  pain  that  high  gasoline  prices  that  we  have  experi-
enced recently, have caused American families and businesses, and 
we are continuing our intense scrutiny of conduct in the petroleum 
industry in the aftermath of Katrina. The FTC will proceed aggres-
sively  against  any  violations  of  the  antitrust  and  consumer-protec-
tion laws that it enforces. 

The  Commission  is  committed  to  maintaining  competitive  mar-
kets  in  refined  petroleum  products,  and  has  pursued  a  three- 
pronged  approach  to  this  industry,  consisting  of  vigorous  law  en-
forcement  against  anticompetitive  mergers  and  business  conduct, 
careful  study  of  various  developments  with  competitive  implica-
tions for the petroleum industry, and an ongoing project to monitor 
gasoline  and  diesel  prices  in  order  to  detect  unusual  price  move-
ments. 

Before  I  outline  these  elements  of  our  program,  however,  I  want 
to address, briefly, a topic that has loomed large in the public con-
sciousness  and  in  the  minds  of  many  in  Congress  in  recent  weeks, 
the  subject  of  gasoline  price  manipulation  and  gasoline  price- 
gouging. 

The FTC has already launched an investigation pursuant to Sec-
tion  1809  of  the  recently  enacted  Energy  Policy  Act,  to  search  for 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  15:23 May 10, 2011 Jkt 066218 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\66218.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

63 

evidence  of  gasoline  price  manipulation,  and  expeditiously  prepare 
a report to Congress on its findings. Although dealing with the con-
cept  of  price-gouging  presents  tremendous  complexities,  as  dis-
cussed in today’s FTC written testimony, there should be no doubt 
that  the  FTC  will  take  aggressive  enforcement  action  against  any 
conduct  unearthed  in  its  Section  1809  investigation  that  violates 
the Federal antitrust laws. 

A  significant,  recent  development  in  the  FTC’s  law  enforcement 
program  was  the  issuance  of  dual  consent  orders  in  late  July  de-
signed  to  remedy  the  anticompetitive  effects  of  Unocal’s  allegedly 
deceptive  conduct  in  connection  with  the  development  of  reformu-
lated  gasoline  in  California,  as  well  as  the  alleged  anticompetitive 
effects  that  were  anticipated  from  Chevron’s  acquisition  of  Unocal. 
The Commission’s first complaint alleged that Unocal had deceived 
the  California  Air  Resources  Board—CARB,  for  short—in  devel-
oping  standards  for  reformulated  gasoline.  The  Commission  chal-
lenged  Unocal’s  misrepresentation  that  certain  technology  was  in 
the  public  domain,  while  it  pursued  patents  on  that  technology  to 
enable it to charge substantial royalties. 

The  proposed  merger  between  Chevron  and  Unocal  raised  the 
concern  that  if  Chevron  had  acquired  Unocal’s  patents,  Chevron 
could  have  obtained  sensitive  information,  and,  thus,  could  have 
used  this  information  and  power  to  facilitate  coordination  among 
competitors  to  raise  gasoline  prices.  The  two  consent  orders  em-
bodying Chevron’s commitment not to enforce the Unocal’s patents 
provided  a  significant  victory  for  consumers.  The  Commission  has 
estimated  that  the  main  relief  provided  by  these  orders  could  save 
California  gasoline  consumers  around  $500  million  per  year.  The 
FTC  will  continue  its  energetic  enforcement  of  the  antitrust  laws 
against  collusive  and  monopolistic  practices  in  the  petroleum  in-
dustry. 

In  aid  of  its  extensive  law-enforcement  work,  the  FTC  also  con-
ducts  careful  research  on  key  competitive  issues  in  the  petroleum 
industry.  I  especially  commend  our  recent  report  on  gasoline  price 
changes  to  the  Committee’s  attention.  The  report  sets  forth  in  de-
tail the numerous supply, demand, and competitive factors that in-
fluence  gasoline  prices,  or  cause  gasoline  price  spikes.  The  report 
shows  that  the  market  for  gasoline  functions  as  any  other  market 
is  expected  to,  when  supply  is  significantly  constrained  and  de-
mand  keeps  rising.  As  important,  the  report  also  shows  that  mar-
ket  forces,  in  the  form  of  changes  in  how  much  gasoline  producers 
supply and consumers demand, can ameliorate price increases. 

A  related  FTC  study  issued  last  year  was  our  staff  report  on 
Mergers,  Structural  Change,  and  Antitrust  Enforcement  in  the  Pe-
troleum Industry over the past 20 years. 

The  third  prong  of  our  approach  is  a  continuous  effort  by  our 
staff  to  identify  unusual  gasoline  and  diesel  price  movements.  Our 
economists  monitor  daily  pricing  data  from  20  wholesale  regions 
and  nearly  360  retail  areas  across  the  Nation.  If  the  statistical 
model that they apply detects any unusual pricing movements that 
cannot  be  explained  by  a  refinery  outage,  a  pipeline  break  or  an-
other  business-related  cause,  the  FTC  staff,  in  consultation  with 
other Federal and State officials, will examine whether a law viola-
tion has been committed.

In view of the escalating prices that consumers have been paying 
for gasoline and other energy products, we will examine any infor-
mation  that  we  receive  about  pricing  to  determine  whether  there 
is a basis for legal action under the anti-collusion and anti-monop-
oly  statutes  that  the  FTC  enforces.  For  those  complaints  that  are 
not a violation of Federal law, the State Attorneys General appear 
to be going forward with the major multi-state initiatives that they 
began  in  the  wake  of  Katrina  to  pursue  such  complaints  under 
State statutes. 

The energy industry, especially the petroleum sector, has been a 
centerpiece  of  FTC  antitrust  enforcement  for  decades,  and  the 
Commission  expects  to  devote  substantial  resources  to  policing  the 
competitiveness of the industry in this time of economic duress for 
many  of  our  fellow  citizens.  Moreover,  as  it  always  does,  the  Com-
mission  will  give  state  and  local  officials  as  much  assistance  as  it 
can as those authorities carry out their responsibilities. 

Thank  you,  again,  for  this  opportunity  to  present  the  FTC’s 
views,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  would  be  happy  to  answer  any  ques-
tions. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Seesel follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN H. SEESEL, ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR 

ENERGY, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 

I. Introduction 

Mr.  Chairman,  and  members  of  the  Committee,  I  am  John  Seesel,  the  Federal 
Trade  Commission’s  Associate  General  Counsel  for  Energy.  I  am  pleased  to  appear 
before you to present the Commission’s testimony on FTC initiatives to protect com-
petitive markets in the production, distribution, and sale of gasoline, and to discuss 
an  important  recent  Commission  study  on  the  factors  that  affect  gasoline  prices.1 
The  petroleum  industry  plays  a  crucial  role  in  our  economy.  Not  only  do  changes 
in gasoline prices affect consumers directly, but the price and availability of gasoline 
also  influences  many  other  economic  sectors.  No  other  industry’s  performance  is 
more deeply felt, and no other industry is so carefully scrutinized by the FTC. 

Prior to Hurricane Katrina, increasing crude oil prices had resulted in rising gaso-
line prices during much of this year. Despite these rising prices, the demand for gas-
oline  during  this  past  summer  was  strong  and  exceeded  summer  demand  in  2004. 
In  the  recent  weeks  since  Hurricane  Katrina,  gasoline  prices  rose  sharply  to  $3.00 
per gallon or more in most markets. In part because of the soaring prices associated 
with  Katrina,  gasoline  demand  has  decreased  somewhat.  National  gasoline  inven-
tories remain at the lower end of the average range. 

On  top  of  an  already  tight  market,  Katrina  has  temporarily  disrupted  an  impor-
tant  source  of  crude  oil  and  gasoline  supply.  At  one  point,  over  95  percent  of  Gulf 
Coast crude oil production was shut-in, and numerous refineries and pipelines were 
either  damaged  or  without  electricity.2 As  of  one  week  ago,  56.1  percent  of  Gulf 
Coast production remained shut-in.3 Because of this massive supply disruption, sub-
stantial price relief has been, and will be, delayed. Although it is heartening to see 
that much Gulf Coast production is back online, full-scale production in that region 
has yet to resume. Our past studies suggest that, as gasoline supplies return to pre- 
Katrina levels, prices should recede from recent high levels. Indeed, retail prices in 
nearly all areas have fallen in recent days, and accompanying declines in wholesale 
prices presage further price declines at retail. It is important to remember, however, 
that  Katrina  damaged  important  parts  of  the  energy  infrastructure  in  the  Gulf 
Coast region, including oil and gas production and refining and processing facilities. 
Some  adverse  effect  on  energy  prices  may  persist  until  the  infrastructure  recovers 
fully—a process that could take months. 

Katrina  has  affected  more  than  gasoline  markets;  the  storm  is  expected  to  have 
widespread  effects  throughout  the  economy.  The  Congressional  Budget  Office  ten-
tatively  estimated  that  Katrina  could  reduce  real  gross  domestic  product  growth  in 
the second half of this year by one-half to 1 percentage point and could reduce em-
ployment by about 400,000 through the end of the year. 4 Higher energy prices will 
be  a  burden  on  other  sectors  of  the  economy  and  will  affect  consumers  not  only  di-

rectly  in  the  gasoline  and  other  energy  products  that  they  purchase,  but  also  indi-
rectly in raising prices of inputs into other goods and services. In addition, Katrina 
damaged  many  other  industries  and  businesses  on  the  Gulf  Coast,  and  some  of 
those  impacts—such  as  the  damage  to  port  facilities—may  significantly  impede  the 
flow of raw materials or finished goods to producers and distributors in many indus-
tries. 

The  Commission  is  very  conscious  of  the  swift  and  severe  price  spikes  that  oc-
curred immediately before and after Katrina made landfall. There have been numer-
ous  calls  for  investigations  of  ‘‘price-gouging,’’  particularly  at  the  retail  gasoline 
level.  Legislation  that  would  require  the  Commission  to  study  this  issue  recently 
passed the Senate.5 In addition, Section 1809 of the recently enacted Energy Policy 
Act 6 mandates  an  FTC  investigation  ‘‘to  determine  if  the  price  of  gasoline  is  being 
artificially  manipulated  by  reducing  refinery  capacity  or  by  any  other  form  of  mar-
ket  manipulation  or  price-gouging  practices.’’  The  Commission  staff  already  has 
launched  an  investigation  to  scrutinize  whether  unlawful  conduct  affecting  refinery 
capacity or other forms of illegal behavior have provided a foundation for price ma-
nipulation.  A  determination  that  unlawful  conduct  has  occurred  will  result  in  ag-
gressive law enforcement activity by the FTC. 

The  FTC  has  initiated  this  inquiry  with  a  keen  understanding  of  its  importance 
to  the  American  consumer  and  intends  faithfully  to  fulfill  its  obligation  to  search 
for and stop illegal conduct. We recognize, of course, that our investigation will not 
be a simple one. As many have already pointed out, ‘‘price-gouging’’ is not prohibited 
by  Federal  law.  Consumers  justifiably  are  upset  when  they  face  dramatic  price  in-
creases  within  very  short  periods  of  time,  especially  during  a  disaster.  Some  prices 
increases,  however,  benefit  consumers  in  the  long  run.  In  our  economy,  prices  play 
a  critical  role:  they  signal  producers  to  increase  or  decrease  supply,  and  they  also 
signal  consumers  to  increase  or  decrease  demand.  In  a  period  of  shortage—particu-
larly  with  a  fungible  product,  like  gasoline,  that  can  be  sold  anywhere  in  the 
world—higher  prices  create  incentives  for  suppliers  to  send  more  product  into  the 
market,  while  also  creating  incentives  for  consumers  to  use  less  of  the  product. 
Higher  prices  ultimately  help  make  the  shortage  shorter-lived  than  it  otherwise 
would  have  been.  There  may  be  situations  where  sellers  go  beyond  the  necessary 
market-induced  price  increase,  taking  advantage  of  a  crisis  to  ‘‘gouge’’  consumers. 
However,  it  can  be  very  difficult  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  any  price  in-
creases are greater than necessary. Furthermore, even these ‘‘gouging’’ types of price 
increases  do  not  fit  well  under  long-standing  principles  of  antitrust  injury.  Under 
the antitrust laws, a seller with lawfully acquired market power—including market 
power arising from an act of God—can charge whatever price the market will bear, 
so long as this seller does not join with others to set prices or restrict supply. 

Finally,  many  states  have  statutes  that  address  short-term  price  spikes  in  the 
aftermath of a disaster, and we understand that a number of them have opened in-
vestigations  of  gasoline  price-gouging.  At  the  retail  level,  state  officials—because  of 
their  proximity  to  local  retail  outlets—can  react  more  expeditiously  than  a  Federal 
agency could to the many complaints that consumers have filed about local gasoline 
prices. Nevertheless, these issues will not deter the FTC from investigating and re-
sponding to any manipulation of gasoline prices we are able to uncover that violates 
Federal antitrust law. 

In  addition  to  the  recently  commenced  investigation,  recent  FTC  activity  in  the 
gasoline  industry  includes  the  acceptance  on  June  10,  2005,  of  two  consent  orders 
that resolved the competitive concerns relating to Chevron’s acquisition of Union Oil 
of  California  (Unocal)  and  settled  the  Commission’s  2003  monopolization  complaint 
against  Unocal.  The  Unocal  settlement  alone  has  the  potential  to  save  billions  of 
dollars  for  California  consumers  in  future  years.  In  addition,  in  early  July  of  this 
year,  the  Commission  published  its  study  explaining  the  competitive  dynamics  of 
gasoline pricing and price changes.7 This study grew out of conferences of industry, 
consumer, academic, and government participants held by the Commission over the 
past  4  years,  as  well  as  years  of  research  and  experience,  and  sheds  light  on  how 
gasoline prices are set. 

In  2004,  the  FTC  staff  published  a  study  reviewing  the  petroleum  industry’s 
mergers  and  structural  changes  as  well  as  the  antitrust  enforcement  actions  that 
the  Agency  has  taken  over  the  past  20  years.8 Commission  enforcement  statistics 
show  that  the  FTC  has  challenged  proposed  mergers  in  this  industry  at  lower  con-
centration levels than in other industries. Since 1981, the FTC has filed complaints 
against 19 large petroleum mergers. In 13 of these cases, the FTC obtained signifi-
cant divestitures. Of the six other matters, the parties in four cases abandoned the 
transactions  altogether  after  Agency  antitrust  challenges;  one  case  resulted  in  a 
remedy requiring the acquiring firm to provide the Commission with advance notice

66 

of  its  intent  to  acquire  or  merge  with  another  entity;  and  the  sixth  case  was  re-
solved recently.9 

In  addition  to  litigation  and  industry  studies,  the  Commission  has  taken  aggres-
sive measures to protect consumers through other initiatives. For example, in a pro-
gram  unique  to  the  petroleum  industry,  the  Commission  actively  and  continuously 
monitors  retail  and  wholesale  prices  of  gasoline  and  diesel  fuel.10 Three  years  ago, 
the  FTC  launched  this  initiative  to  monitor  gasoline  and  diesel  prices  to  identify 
‘‘unusual’’  price  movements 11 and  then  examine  whether  any  such  movements 
might  result  from  anticompetitive  conduct  that  violates  Section  5  of  the  FTC  Act. 
FTC  economists  developed  a  statistical  model  for  identifying  such  movements.  The 
Agency’s  economists  scrutinize  regularly  price  movements  in  20  wholesale  regions 
and  approximately  360  retail  areas  across  the  country.  Again,  in  no  other  industry 
does the Commission so closely monitor prices. 

The  staff  reviews  daily  data  from  the  Oil  Price  Information  Service,  a  private 
data-collection  agency,  and  receives  information  weekly  from  the  public  gasoline 
price hotline maintained by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The staff moni-
toring  team  uses  an  econometric  model  to  determine  whether  current  retail  and 
wholesale  prices  are  anomalous  in  comparison  to  the  historical  price  relationships 
among  cities.  When  there  are  unusual  changes  in  gasoline  or  diesel  prices,  the 
project alerts the staff to those anomalies so that we can make further inquiries into 
the situation. 

This gasoline and diesel monitoring and investigation initiative, which focuses on 
the  timely  identification  of  unusual  movements  in  prices  (compared  to  historical 
trends),  is  one  of  the  tools  that  the  FTC  uses  to  determine  whether  a  law  enforce-
ment  investigation  is  warranted.  If  the  FTC  staff  detects  unusual  price  movements 
in an area, it researches the possible causes, including, where appropriate, through 
consultation with the state attorneys general, state energy agencies, and DOE’s En-
ergy  Information  Administration.  In  addition  to  monitoring  DOE’s  gasoline  price 
hotline  complaints,  this  project  includes  scrutiny  of  gasoline  price  complaints  re-
ceived  by  the  Commission’s  Consumer  Response  Center  and  of  similar  information 
provided  to  the  FTC  by  state  and  local  officials.  If  the  staff  concludes  that  an  un-
usual  price  movement  likely  results  from  a  business-related  cause  (i.e.,  a  cause  un-
related  to  anticompetitive  conduct),  it  continues  to  monitor  but—absent  indications 
of  potentially  anticompetitive  conduct—it  does  not  investigate  further.12 The  Com-
mission’s  experience  from  its  past  investigations  and  from  the  current  monitoring 
initiative indicates that unusual movements in gasoline prices typically have a busi-
ness-related cause. FTC staff further investigates unusual price movements that do 
not  appear  to  be  explained  by  business-related  causes  to  determine  whether  anti-
competitive  conduct  may  underlie  the  pricing  anomaly.  Cooperation  with  state  law 
enforcement officials is an important element of such investigations. 

The  Commission’s  testimony  today  addresses  the  Committee’s  inquiries  in  two 
parts. It first reviews the basic tools that the Commission uses to promote competi-
tion  in  the  petroleum  industry:  challenging  potentially  anticompetitive  mergers, 
prosecuting  nonmerger  antitrust  violations,  monitoring  industry  behavior  to  detect 
possible  anticompetitive  conduct,  and  researching  petroleum  sector  developments. 
This  review  of  the  Commission’s  petroleum  industry  agenda  highlights  the  FTC’s 
contributions  to  promoting  and  maintaining  competition  in  the  industry.  The  Com-
mission  places  a  premium  on  careful  research,  industry  monitoring,  and  investiga-
tions  to  understand  current  petroleum  industry  developments  and  to  identify  accu-
rately obstacles to competition, whether arising from private behavior or from public 
policies.  The  petroleum  industry’s  performance  is  shaped  by  the  interaction  of  ex-
traordinarily complex, fast-changing commercial arrangements and an elaborate set 
of  public  regulatory  commands.  A  well-informed  understanding  of  these  factors  is 
essential if FTC actions are to benefit consumers. 

The  second  part  of  this  testimony  reviews  the  learning  the  Commission  has  de-
rived  from  its  conferences  and  research  and  its  review  of  recent  gasoline  price 
changes.  Among  other  findings,  this  discussion  highlights  the  paramount  role  that 
crude  oil  prices  play  in  determining  both  the  levels  and  the  volatility  of  gasoline 
prices  in  the  United  States.  Over  the  period  1984  to  2003,  changes  in  crude  oil 
prices accounted for approximately 85 percent of the variability of gasoline prices.13 
When  crude  oil  prices  rise,  so  do  gasoline  prices.  Crude  oil  prices  are  determined 
by  supply-and-demand  conditions  worldwide.  The  supply  of  crude  is  strongly  influ-
enced by production levels set by members of the Organization of Petroleum Export-
ing  Countries  (OPEC).14 Demand  has  increased  substantially  over  the  past  few 
years,  both  in  the  United  States  and  in  the  developing  economies  of  China  and 
India.  When  worldwide  supply-and-demand  conditions  result  in  crude  oil  prices  in 
the  range  of  $70  per  barrel—a  level  from  which  we  are  all  doubtless  glad  to  have

seen  the  price  recede  somewhat  in  recent  days—it  is  not  surprising  to  see  higher 
gasoline prices nationwide. 
II.  FTC  Activities  To  Maintain  and  Promote  Competition  in  the  Petroleum 

Industry 

A. Merger Enforcement in the Petroleum Industry 

The  Commission  has  gained  much  of  its  antitrust  enforcement  experience  in  the 
petroleum  industry  by  analyzing  proposed  mergers  and  challenging  transactions 
that likely would reduce competition, thus resulting in higher prices.15 In 2004, the 
Commission  released  data  on  all  horizontal  merger  investigations  and  enforcement 
actions  from  1996  to  2003.16 These  data  show  that  the  Commission  has  brought 
more  merger  cases  at  lower  levels  of  concentration  in  the  petroleum  industry  than 
in other industries. Unlike in other industries, the Commission has obtained merger 
relief in moderately concentrated petroleum markets. 

Several  recent  merger  investigations  illustrate  the  FTC’s  approach  to  merger 
analysis  in  the  petroleum  industry.  The  most  recently  completed  case  involved 
Chevron’s acquisition of Unocal. When the merger investigation began, the Commis-
sion was in the middle of an ongoing monopolization case against Unocal that would 
have  been  affected  by  the  merger.  Thus,  the  Commission  settled  both  the  merger 
and  the  monopolization  matters  with  separate  consent  orders  that  preserved  com-
petition in all relevant merger markets and obtained complete relief on the monopo-
lization claim.17 The nonmerger case is discussed below. 

Another  recent  merger  case  that  resulted  in  a  divestiture  order  resolved  a  com-
plaint  concerning  the  acquisition  of  Kaneb  Services  and  Kaneb  Pipe  Line  Partners, 
companies  that  engaged  in  petroleum  transportation  and  terminaling  in  a  number 
of markets, by Valero L.P., the largest petroleum terminal operator and second larg-
est  operator  of  liquid  petroleum  pipelines  in  the  United  States.18 The  complaint  al-
leged  that  the  acquisition  had  the  potential  to  increase  prices  in  bulk  gasoline  and 
diesel markets.19 

The  FTC’s  consent  order  requires  the  parties  to  divest  assets  sufficient  to  main-
tain  premerger  competition,  including  certain  Kaneb  Philadelphia-area  terminals, 
Kaneb’s West pipeline system in Colorado’s Front Range, and Kaneb’s Martinez and 
Richmond  terminals  in  Northern  California.20 In  addition,  the  order  forbids  Valero 
L.P.  from  discriminating  in  favor  of  or  otherwise  preferring  its  Valero  Energy  affil-
iate in bulk ethanol terminaling services, and requires Valero to maintain customer 
confidentiality  at  the  Selby  and  Stockton  terminals  in  Northern  California.  The 
order succeeds in maintaining import possibilities for wholesale customers in North-
ern California, Denver, and greater Philadelphia and precludes the merging parties 
from undertaking an anticompetitive price increase. 

Most recently, the Commission filed a complaint on July 27, 2005, in Federal dis-
trict  court  in  Hawaii,  alleging  that  Aloha  Petroleum’s  proposed  acquisition  of 
Trustreet Properties’ half interest in an import-capable terminal and retail gasoline 
assets  on  the  island  of  Oahu  would  reduce  the  number  of  gasoline  marketers  and 
could lead to higher gasoline prices for Hawaii consumers.21 The recently announced 
resolution of this case involved the execution by the parties of a 20-year throughput 
agreement  that  will  preserve  competition  allegedly  threatened  by  the  acquisition.22 
In  the  past  few  years,  the  Commission  has  brought  a  number  of  other  important 
merger  cases.  One  of  these  involved  the  merger  of  Chevron  and  Texaco,23 which 
combined  assets  located  throughout  the  United  States.  Following  an  investigation 
in which 12 states participated, the Commission issued a consent order against the 
merging  parties  requiring  numerous  divestitures  to  maintain  competition  in  par-
ticular  relevant  markets,  primarily  in  the  western  and  southern  United  States.24 
Among  other  requirements,  the  consent  order  compelled  Texaco  to:  (a)  divest  to 
Shell  and/or  Saudi  Refining,  Inc.,  all  of  its  interests  in  two  joint  ventures— 
Equilon 25 and  Motiva 26—through  which  Texaco  had  been  competing  with  Chevron 
in  gasoline  marketing  in  the  western  and  southern  United  States;  (b)  divest  all  as-
sets relating to the refining, bulk supply, and marketing of gasoline satisfying Cali-
fornia’s  environmental  quality  standards;  (c)  divest  assets  relating  to  the  refining 
and bulk supply of gasoline and jet fuel in the Pacific Northwest; and (d) divest var-
ious pipelines used to transport petroleum products. 

Another  petroleum  industry  transaction  that  the  Commission  challenged  success-
fully was the $6 billion merger between Valero Energy Corp. (Valero) and Ultramar 
Diamond Shamrock Corp. (Ultramar).27 Both Valero and Ultramar were leading re-
finers and marketers of gasoline that met the specifications of the California Air Re-
sources  Board  (CARB),  and  they  were  the  only  significant  suppliers  to  independent 
stations  in  California.  The  Commission’s  complaint  alleged  competitive  concerns  in 
both the refining and bulk supply of CARB gasoline in two separate geographic mar-
kets—Northern  California  and  the  entire  State  of  California—and  the  Commission

68 

contended  that  the  merger  could  raise  the  cost  to  California  consumers  by  at  least 
$150  million  annually  for  every  one-cent-per-gallon  price  increase  at  retail.28 To 
remedy  the  alleged  violations,  the  consent  order  settling  the  case  required  Valero 
to  divest:  (a)  an  Ultramar  refinery  in  Avon,  California;  (b)  all  bulk  gasoline  supply 
contracts associated with that refinery; and (c) 70 Ultramar retail stations in North-
ern California.29 

Another example is the Commission’s 2002 challenge to the merger of Phillips Pe-
troleum  Company  and  Conoco  Inc.,  alleging  that  the  transaction  would  harm  com-
petition  in  the  Midwest  and  Rocky  Mountain  regions  of  the  United  States.  To  re-
solve that challenge, the Commission required the divestiture of: (a) the Phillips re-
finery in Woods Cross, Utah, and all of the Phillips-related marketing assets served 
by  that  refinery;  (b)  Conoco’s  refinery  in  Commerce  City,  Colorado  (near  Denver), 
and  all  of  the  Phillips  marketing  assets  in  Eastern  Colorado;  and  (c)  the  Phillips 
light  petroleum  products  terminal  in  Spokane,  Washington.30 The  Commission’s 
order ensured that competition would not be lost and that gasoline prices would not 
increase as a result of the merger. 
B. Nonmerger Investigations Into Gasoline Pricing 

In  addition  to  scrutinizing  mergers,  the  Commission  aggressively  polices  anti-
competitive conduct. When it appears that higher prices might result from collusive 
activity or from anticompetitive unilateral activity by a firm with market power, the 
agency  investigates  to  determine  whether  unfair  methods  of  competition  have  been 
used. If the facts warrant, the Commission challenges the anticompetitive behavior, 
usually by issuing an administrative complaint. 

Several  recent  petroleum  investigations  are  illustrative.  On  March  4,  2003,  the 
Commission  issued  the  administrative  complaint  against  Unocal  discussed  earlier, 
stating that it had reason to believe that Unocal had violated Section 5 of the FTC 
Act.31 The  Commission  alleged  that  Unocal  deceived  the  California  Air  Resources 
Board  (CARB)  in  connection  with  regulatory  proceedings  to  develop  the  reformu-
lated  gasoline  (RFG)  standards  that  CARB  adopted.  Unocal  allegedly  misrepre-
sented that certain technology was non-proprietary and in the public domain, while 
at the same time it pursued patents that would enable it to charge substantial roy-
alties  if  CARB  mandated  the  use  of  Unocal’s  technology  in  the  refining  of  CARB- 
compliant  summertime  RFG.  The  Commission  alleged  that,  as  a  result  of  these  ac-
tivities, Unocal illegally acquired monopoly power in the technology market for pro-
ducing  the  new  CARB-compliant  summertime  RFG,  thus  undermining  competition 
and  harming  consumers  in  the  downstream  product  market  for  CARB-compliant 
summertime  RFG  in  California.  The  Commission  estimated  that  Unocal’s  enforce-
ment  of  its  patents  could  potentially  result  in  over  $500  million  of  additional  con-
sumer costs each year. 

The proposed merger between Chevron and Unocal raised additional concerns. Al-
though Unocal had no horizontal refining or retailing overlaps with Chevron, it had 
claimed  the  right  to  collect  patent  royalties  from  companies  that  had  refining  and 
retailing assets (including Chevron). If Chevron had unconditionally inherited these 
patents by acquisition, it would have been in a position to obtain sensitive informa-
tion  and  to  claim  royalties  from  its  own  horizontal  downstream  competitors.  Chev-
ron, the Commission alleged, could have used this information and this power to fa-
cilitate coordinated interaction and detect any deviations. 

The  Commission  resolved  both  the  Chevron/Unocal  merger  investigation  and  the 
monopolization  case  against  Unocal  with  consent  orders.  The  key  element  in  these 
orders is Chevron’s agreement not to enforce the Unocal patents.32 The FTC’s settle-
ment  of  these  two  matters  is  a  substantial  victory  for  California  consumers.  The 
Commission’s  monopolization  case  against  Unocal  was  complex  and,  with  possible 
appeals,  could  have  taken  years  to  resolve,  with  substantial  royalties  to  Unocal— 
and  higher  consumer  prices—in  the  interim.  The  settlement  provides  the  full  relief 
sought  in  the  monopolization  case  and  also  resolves  the  only  competitive  issue 
raised by the merger. With the settlement, consumers will benefit immediately from 
the elimination of royalty payments on the Unocal patents, and potential merger ef-
ficiencies could result in additional savings at the pump. 

The FTC undertook another major nonmerger investigation during 1998–2001, ex-
amining  the  major  oil  refiners’  marketing  and  distribution  practices  in  Arizona, 
California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington (the ‘‘Western States’’ investigation).33 
The agency initiated the Western States investigation out of concern that differences 
in gasoline prices in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego might be due partly 
to  anticompetitive  activities.  The  Commission’s  staff  examined  over  300  boxes  of 
documents,  conducted  100  interviews,  held  over  30  investigational  hearings,  and 
analyzed a substantial amount of pricing data. The investigation uncovered no basis 
to  allege  an  antitrust  violation.  Specifically,  the  investigation  detected  no  evidence 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  15:23 May 10, 2011 Jkt 066218 PO 00000 Frm 00072 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\66218.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

69 

of  a  horizontal  agreement  on  price  or  output  or  the  adoption  of  any  illegal  vertical 
distribution practice at any level of supply. The investigation also found no evidence 
that  any  refiner  had  the  unilateral  ability  to  raise  prices  profitably  in  any  market 
or reduce output at the wholesale level. Accordingly, the Commission closed the in-
vestigation in May 2001. 

In conducting these and other inquiries, the Commission makes the important dis-
tinction  between  short-term  and  long-term  effects.  While  a  refinery  outage  on  the 
West  Coast  could  significantly  affect  short-term  prices,  the  FTC  did  not  find  that 
it would be profitable in the long run for a refiner to restrict its output to raise the 
level  of  prices  in  the  market.  For  example,  absent  planned  maintenance  or  un-
planned  outages,  refineries  on  the  West  Coast  (and  in  the  rest  of  the  country)  gen-
erally run at full (or nearly full) capacity. If gasoline is in short supply in a locality 
due to refinery or pipeline outages, and there are no immediate alternatives, a mar-
ket  participant  may  find  that  it  can  profitably  increase  prices  as  demand  for  its 
products  increases—generally  only  for  a  short  time,  until  the  outage  is  fixed  or  al-
ternative  supply  becomes  available.  This  transient  power-over-price—which  occurs 
infrequently  and  lasts  only  as  long  as  the  shortage—should  not  be  confused  with 
the durable power over price that is the hallmark of market power in antitrust law. 
In addition to the Unocal and Western States pricing investigations, the Commis-
sion  conducted  a  9-month  investigation  into  the  causes  of  gasoline  price  spikes  in 
local  markets  in  the  Midwest  in  the  Spring  and  early  Summer  of  2000.34 As  ex-
plained in a 2001 report, the Commission found that a variety of factors contributed 
in different degrees to the price spikes. Primary factors included refinery production 
problems  (e.g.,  refinery  breakdowns  and  unexpected  difficulties  in  producing  the 
new summer-grade RFG gasoline required for use in Chicago and Milwaukee), pipe-
line  disruptions,  and  low  inventories.  Secondary  factors  included  high  crude  oil 
prices  that  contributed  to  low  inventory  levels,  the  unavailability  of  substitutes  for 
certain environmentally required gasoline formulations, increased demand for gaso-
line in the Midwest, and ad valorem taxes in certain states. The industry responded 
quickly  to  the  price  spike.  Within  three  or  4  weeks,  an  increased  supply  of  product 
had  been  delivered  to  the  Midwest  areas  suffering  from  the  supply  disruption.  By 
mid-July 2000, prices had receded to pre-spike or even lower levels. 

The Commission’s merger investigations also are relevant to the detection of non-
merger  antitrust  violations.  FTC  oil  and  gas  merger  investigations  during  the  past 
decade  uniformly  have  been  major  undertakings  that  have  reviewed  all  pertinent 
facets  of  the  relevant  markets.  These  investigations  have  involved  the  review  of 
thousands of boxes of documents in discovery, examination of witnesses under oath, 
and exhaustive questioning of outside experts. The FTC staff, therefore, has learned 
information  that  also  could  assist  in  detecting  and  investigating  potentially  anti-
competitive conduct. 
III. Commission Report on Factors That Affect the Price of Gasoline 

What  are  the  causes  of  high  gasoline  prices  and  gasoline  price  spikes?  These  im-
portant  questions  require  a  thorough  and  accurate  analysis  of  the  factors—supply, 
demand,  and  competition,  as  well  as  Federal,  state,  and  local  regulations—that 
drive gasoline prices, so that policymakers can evaluate and choose strategies likely 
to succeed in addressing high gasoline prices. 

The  Commission  addressed  these  issues  by  conducting  extensive  research  con-
cerning gasoline price fluctuations, analyzing specific instances of apparent gasoline 
price anomalies, and holding a series of conferences 35 on the factors that affect gas-
oline  prices,  leading  to  the  publication  of  a  report 36 that  draws  on  what  the  Com-
mission  has  learned  about  the  factors  that  can  influence  gasoline  prices  or  cause 
gasoline  price  spikes.  The  testimony  discusses  the  findings  of  the  study,  but  first 
sets out three basic lessons that emerge from this collective work. 

First,  in  general,  the  price  of  gasoline  reflects  producers’  costs  and  consumers’ 
willingness to pay. Gasoline prices rise if it costs more to produce and supply gaso-
line,  or  if  people  wish  to  buy  more  gasoline  at  the  current  price—that  is,  when  de-
mand is greater than supply. Gasoline prices fall if it costs less to produce and sup-
ply  gasoline,  or  if  people  wish  to  buy  less  gasoline  at  the  current  price—that  is, 
when supply is greater than demand. Gasoline prices will stop rising or falling when 
they reach the level at which the quantity consumers demand matches the quantity 
that producers will supply. 

Second,  how  consumers  respond  to  price  changes  will  affect  how  high  prices  rise 
and how low they fall. Limited substitutes for gasoline restrict the options available 
to  consumers  to  respond  to  price  increases  in  the  short  run.  Because  gasoline  con-
sumers typically do not reduce their purchases substantially in response to price in-
creases, they are vulnerable to substantial price increases.

Third,  producers’  responses  to  price  changes  will  affect  how  high  prices  rise  and 
how low they fall. In general, when there is not enough gasoline to meet consumers’ 
demands  at  current  prices,  higher  prices  will  signal  a  potential  profit  opportunity 
and  may  bring  additional  supply  into  the  market.  Additional  supply  will  be  avail-
able to the extent that an increase in price exceeds the producers’ cost of expanding 
output. 

The  vast  majority  of  the  Commission’s  investigations  and  studies  have  revealed 
market factors as the primary drivers of both price increases and price spikes. There 
is  a  complex  landscape  of  market  forces  that  affect  gasoline  prices  in  the  United 
States. 
A.  Worldwide  Supply,  Demand,  and  Competition  for  Crude  Oil  Are  the  Most 
Important Factors in the National Average Price of Gasoline in the United States 
Crude  oil  is  a  commodity  that  is  traded  on  world  markets,  and  the  world  price 
of crude oil is the most important factor in the price of gasoline in the United States 
and all other markets. Over the past 20 years, changes in crude oil prices have ex-
plained  approximately  85  percent  of  the  changes  in  the  price  of  gasoline.37 United 
States  refiners  compete  with  refiners  all  around  the  world  to  obtain  crude,  and  the 
United  States  now  imports  more  than  60  percent  of  its  crude  from  foreign  sources. 
If world crude prices rise, then U.S. refiners must pay higher prices for the crude 
they  buy.  Facing  higher  input  costs  from  crude,  refiners  charge  more  for  the  gaso-
line  they  sell  at  wholesale.  This  requires  retail  stations  to  pay  more  for  their  gaso-
line.  In  turn,  retail  stations,  facing  higher  input  costs,  charge  consumers  more  at 
the pump. In short, when crude oil prices rise, gasoline prices rise because gasoline 
becomes more costly to produce. 

Crude  oil  prices  are  not  wholly  market-determined.  Since  1973,  decisions  by 
OPEC  have  been  a  significant  factor  in  the  prices  that  refiners  pay  for  crude  oil. 
Over  time,  OPEC  has  met  with  varying  degrees  of  success  in  raising  crude  oil 
prices. (For example, OPEC members can be tempted to ‘‘cheat’’ and sometimes sell 
more  crude  oil  than  specified  by  OPEC  limits.)  Higher  world  crude  prices  due  to 
OPEC’s  actions,  however,  increased  the  incentives  to  search  for  oil  in  other  areas, 
and crude supplies from non-OPEC members such as Canada, the United Kingdom, 
and  Norway  have  increased  significantly.  Nonetheless,  OPEC  still  produces  a  large 
enough  share  of  world  crude  oil  to  exert  market  power  and  strongly  influence  the 
price of crude oil when its members adhere to their assigned production quotas. Es-
pecially when demand surges unexpectedly, as in 2004, OPEC decisions on whether 
to  increase  supply  to  meet  demand  can  have  a  significant  impact  on  world  crude 
oil prices. 

Crude oil consumption has fallen during some periods over the past 30 years, par-
tially  in  reaction  to  higher  prices  and  partially  in  response  to  Federal  laws,  such 
as  requirements  to  increase  the  fuel  efficiency  of  cars.  Gasoline  consumption  in  the 
United States fell significantly between 1978 and 1982, and remained lower during 
the  1980s  than  it  had  been  at  the  beginning  of  1978.38 Overall,  however,  the  long- 
run  trend  is  toward  significantly  increased  demand  for  crude  oil.  Over  the  last  20 
years, United States consumption of all refined petroleum products increased on av-
erage by 1.4 percent per year, leading to a total increase of nearly 30 percent.39 

Although they have receded from the record levels they reached immediately after 
Hurricane  Katrina,  crude  oil  prices  have  been  increasing  rapidly  in  recent  months. 
Demand has remained high in the United States, and large demand increases from 
rapidly  industrializing  nations,  particularly  China  and  India,  have  made  supplies 
much tighter than expected.40 
B.  Gasoline  Supply,  Demand,  and  Competition  Produced  Relatively  Low  and  Stable 
Prices  From  1984  Until  2004,  Despite  Substantial  Increases  in  United  States 
Gasoline Consumption 

Consumer demand for gasoline in the United States has risen substantially, espe-
cially since 1990.41 In 1978, U.S. gasoline consumption was about 7.4 million barrels 
per day. By 1981, in the face of sharply escalating crude oil and gasoline prices and 
a  recession,  U.S.  gasoline  consumption  had  fallen  to  approximately  6.5  million  bar-
rels  per  day.42 As  gasoline  prices  began  to  fall  in  the  1980s,  U.S.  consumption  of 
gasoline began to rise once again. By 1993, consumption rose above 1978 levels, and 
it has continued to increase at a fairly steady rate since then. In 2004, U.S. gasoline 
consumption  averaged  about  9  million  barrels  per  day,  and  the  EIA’s  forecast  as  of 
last spring was for 9.2 million barrels per day this year.43 

Despite  high  gasoline  prices  across  the  Nation,  demand  generally  has  not  fallen 
off  in  2005  (although  there  are  reports  of  some  diminution  in  demand  in  the  wake 
of  Katrina).  Gasoline  demand  this  Summer  driving  season  was  above  last  year’s 
record  driving-season  demand  and  well  above  the  average  for  the  previous  4  years.

Average  daily  demand  for  finished  gasoline  for  May  was  9.3  millions  barrels  per 
day,  an  increase  of  1.2  percent  over  May  of  2004,  and  5.5  percent  higher  than  the 
average  demand  for  the  previous  four  summers.  Similarly,  June’s  demand  was  up 
2.8 percent over last June (up 5.4 percent from the average of the previous 4 years) 
and  July’s  demand  increase  was  up  3.2  percent  over  July  of  2004  (up  4.6  percent 
from  average  of  the  last  4  years).  Gasoline  demand  for  the  4-weeks  that  ended  on 
August  26  of  this  year  was  1.2  percent  higher  than  demand  during  all  of  August 
2004, despite much higher prices.44 

Notwithstanding  these  substantial  demand  increases,  increased  supply  from  U.S. 
refineries  and  imports  kept  gasoline  prices  relatively  steady  until  2004.  A  compari-
son  of  ‘‘real’’  average  annual  retail  gasoline  prices  and  average  annual  retail  gaso-
line  consumption  in  the  United  States  from  1978  through  2004  shows  that,  in  gen-
eral,  gasoline  prices  remained  relatively  stable  despite  significantly  increased  de-
mand.45 Indeed,  over  the  very  long  run  in  the  84-year  period  between  1919  and 
2003,  real  annual  average  retail  gasoline  prices  in  the  United  States  did  not  in-
crease  at  all.  The  data  show  that,  from  1986  through  2003,  real  national  average 
retail prices for gasoline, including taxes, generally were below $2.00 per gallon (in 
2004 dollars). By contrast, between 1919 and 1985, real national average retail gas-
oline prices were above $2.00 per gallon (in 2004 dollars) more often than not.46 

Average U.S. retail prices have been increasing since 2003, however, from an av-
erage  of  $1.56  in  2003  to  an  average  of  $2.04  in  the  first  5  months  of  2005.47 In 
the last several months, the prices have moved even higher. Setting aside whatever 
short-term effects may be associated with Hurricane Katrina, it is difficult to predict 
whether these increases represent the beginning of a longer-term trend or are mere-
ly  normal  market  fluctuations  caused  by  unexpectedly  strong  short-term  worldwide 
demand for crude oil, as well as reflecting the effects of instability in such producing 
areas as the Middle East and Venezuela. 

One  reason  why  long-term  real  prices  have  been  relatively  contained  is  that 
United  States  refiners  have  taken  advantage  of  economies  of  scale  and  adopted 
more efficient technologies and business strategies. Between 1985 and 2005, U.S. re-
fineries  increased  their  total  capacity  to  refine  crude  oil  into  various  refined  petro-
leum  products  by  8.9  percent,  moving  from  15.7  million  barrels  per  day  in  1985  to 
17.133  million  barrels  per  day  as  of  August  2005.48 This  increase—approximately 
1.4 million barrels per day—is roughly equivalent to adding approximately 10 to 12 
average-sized refineries to industry supply. Yet U.S. refiners did not build any new 
refineries during this time. Rather, they added this capacity through the expansion 
of  existing  refineries.  They  also  have  adopted  methods  that  broaden  the  range  of 
crude  oils  that  they  can  process  and  allow  them  to  produce  more  refined  product 
for each barrel of crude processed. In addition, they have decreased their inventory 
costs  by  lowering  their  inventory  holdings  (although  lower  inventory  holdings  may 
also  make  an  area  more  susceptible  to  short-term  price  spikes  when  there  is  a  dis-
ruption in supply). 

Offsetting some of the observed efficiency gains, increased environmental require-
ments  since  1992  have  likely  raised  the  retail  price  of  gasoline  by  a  few  cents  per 
gallon  in  some  areas.  Because  gasoline  use  is  a  major  factor  in  air  pollution  in  the 
United  States,  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency—under  the  Clean  Air 
Act 49—requires  various  gasoline  blends  for  particular  geographic  areas  that  have 
not  met  certain  air  quality  standards.  Although  available  information  shows  that 
the air quality in the United States has improved due to the Clean Air Act,50 costs 
come  with  the  benefits  (as  they  do  with  any  regulatory  program).  Environmental 
laws  and  regulations  have  required  substantial  and  expensive  refinery  upgrades, 
particularly  over  the  past  15  years.  It  costs  more  to  produce  cleaner  gasoline  than 
to  produce  conventional  gasoline.  Estimates  of  the  increased  costs  of  environ-
mentally mandated gasoline range from $0.03 to $0.11 per gallon.51 

FTC  studies  indicate  that  higher  retail  prices  have  not  been  caused  by  excess  oil 
company profits. Although recent oil company profits may be high in absolute terms, 
industry profits have varied widely over time, as well as over industry segments and 
among firms. 

EIA’s  Financial  Reporting  System  (FRS)  tracks  the  financial  performance  of  the 
28 major energy producers currently operating in the United States. In 2003, these 
firms  had  a  return  on  capital  employed  of  12.8  percent,  as  compared  to  the  10  per-
cent return on capital employed for the overall Standard & Poors (S&P) Industrials. 
Between  1973  and  2003,  however,  the  annual  average  return  on  equity  for  FRS 
companies  was  12.6  percent,  while  it  was  13.1  percent  for  the  S&P  Industrials.52 
High absolute profits do not contradict numbers showing that oil companies may at 
times  earn  less  (as  a  percentage  of  capital  or  equity)  than  other  industrial  firms. 
This  simply  reflects  the  large  amount  of  capital  necessary  to  find,  refine,  and  dis-
tribute petroleum products.

72 

The  rates  of  return  on  equity  for  FRS  companies  have  varied  widely  over  the 
years, ranging from as low as 1.1 percent to as high as 21.1 percent during the pe-
riod from 1974 to 2003.53 Returns on equity vary across firms as well. Crude oil ex-
ploration  and  production  operations  typically  generate  much  higher  and  more  vola-
tile  returns  than  refining  and  marketing.  In  essence,  companies  with  exploration 
and  production  operations  now  find  themselves  in  a  position  analogous  to  that  of 
a  homeowner  who  bought  a  house  in  a  popular  area  just  before  increased  demand 
for housing caused real estate prices to escalate. Like the homeowner, crude oil pro-
ducers  can  charge  higher  prices  due  to  increased  demand.  If  high  prices  and  high 
profits are expected to continue, they may draw greater investments over time into 
the  oil  industry—in  particular,  to  crude  exploration  and  production.  Over  the  long 
run,  these  investments  are  likely  to  elicit  more  crude  supply,  which  would  exert  a 
downward pressure on prices. 
C.  Other  Factors,  Such  as  Retail  Station  Density,  New  Retail  Formats,  and  State 

and Local Regulations, Also Can Affect Retail Gasoline Prices 

The interaction of supply-and-demand and industry efficiency are not the only fac-
tors  that  impact  retail  gasoline  prices.  State  and  local  taxes  can  be  a  significant 
component  of  the  final  price  of  gasoline.  In  2004,  the  average  state  sales  tax  was 
$0.225  per  gallon,  with  the  highest  state  tax  at  $0.334  per  gallon  (New  York).54 
Some local governments also impose gasoline taxes.55 

Local regulations may also have an impact on retail gasoline prices. For example, 
bans  on  self-service  sales  or  below-cost  sales  appear  to  raise  gasoline  prices.  New 
Jersey  and  Oregon  ban  self-service  sales,  thus  requiring  consumers  to  buy  gasoline 
bundled  with  services  that  increase  costs—that  is,  having  staff  available  to  pump 
the  gasoline.56 Some  experts  have  estimated  that  self-service  bans  cost  consumers 
between  $0.02  and  $0.05  per  gallon.57 In  addition,  some  11  states  have  laws  ban-
ning below-cost sales, so that a gas station is required to charge a minimum amount 
above its wholesale gasoline price.58 These laws harm consumers by depriving them 
of the lower prices that more efficient (e.g., high-volume) stations can charge. 

Not surprisingly, retail gasoline prices are likely to be lower when consumers can 
choose—and can switch their purchases—among a greater number of retail stations. 
A small number of empirical studies have examined gasoline station density in rela-
tion  to  prices.  One  study  found  that  stations  in  Southern  California  that  imposed 
a  1  percent  price  increase  lost  different  amounts  of  sales,  depending  on  how  many 
competitors  were  close  by.59 Those  with  a  large  number  of  nearby  competitors  (27 
or  more  within  2  miles)  lost  4.4  percent  of  sales  in  response  to  a  1  percent  price 
increase;  those  with  a  smaller  number  of  nearby  competitors  (fewer  than  19  within 
2 miles) lost only 1.5 percent of sales.60 With all else equal, stations that face great-
er  lost  sales  from  raising  prices  likely  will  have  lower  retail  prices  than  stations 
that lose fewer sales from raising prices. 

Station  density  depends  on  cost  conditions  in  an  area.  For  example,  the  size  and 
density  of  a  market  will  influence  how  many  stations  can  operate  and  cover  their 
fixed  costs.  Fixed  costs  will  depend  on  the  costs  of  land  and  of  building  a  station. 
Zoning  regulations  also  may  limit  the  number  of  stations  in  an  area  below  what 
market  conditions  indicate  the  area  could  profitably  sustain.  Studies  suggest  that 
entry by new gasoline competitors tends to be more difficult in areas with high land 
prices and strict zoning regulations.61 

One of the biggest changes in the retail sale of gasoline in the past three decades 
has  been  the  development  of  such  new  formats  as  convenience  stores  and  high-vol-
ume operations. These new formats appear to lower retail gasoline prices. The num-
ber  of  traditional  gasoline-pump-and-repair-bay  outlets  has  dwindled  for  a  number 
of  years,  as  brand-name  gasoline  retailers  have  moved  toward  a  convenience  store 
format.  Independent  gasoline/convenience  stores—such  as  RaceTrac,  Sheetz, 
QuikTrip,  and  Wawa—typically  feature  large  convenience  stores  with  multiple  fuel 
islands and multi-product dispensers. They are sometimes called ‘‘pumpers’’ because 
of their large-volume fuel sales. By 1999, the latest year for which comparable data 
are  available,  brand-name  and  independent  convenience  store  and  pumper  stations 
accounted for almost 67 percent of the volume of U.S. retail gasoline sales.62 

Another  change  to  the  retail  gasoline  market  that  appears  to  have  helped  keep 
gasoline prices lower is the entry of hypermarkets. Hypermarkets are large retailers 
of  general  merchandise  and  grocery  items,  such  as  Wal-Mart  and  Safeway,  that 
have begun to sell gasoline. Hypermarket sites typically sell even larger volumes of 
gasoline 
larger.63 
Hypermarkets’  substantial  economies  of  scale  generally  enable  them  to  sell  signifi-
cantly greater volumes of gasoline at lower prices.

This list of factors that have an impact on retail gasoline prices is not exhaustive, 
but it shows that prices are set by a complex array of market and regulatory forces

working  throughout  the  economy.  In  the  long  run,  these  forces  have  historically 
combined to produce relatively stable real prices in the face of consistently growing 
demand.  Short-run  variations,  while  sometimes  painful  to  consumers,  are  unavoid-
able  in  an  industry  that  depends  on  the  demand  and  supply  decisions  of  literally 
billions of people. 
IV. Conclusion 

The  Federal  Trade  Commission  has  an  aggressive  program  to  enforce  the  anti-
trust  laws  in  the  petroleum  industry.  The  Commission  has  taken  action  whenever 
a  merger  or  nonmerger  conduct  has  violated  the  law  and  threatened  the  welfare  of 
consumers  or  competition  in  the  industry.  The  Commission  continues  to  search  for 
appropriate  targets  of  antitrust  law  enforcement,  to  monitor  retail  and  wholesale 
gasoline and diesel prices closely, and to study this industry in detail. 

Thank you for this opportunity to present the FTC’s views on this important topic. 

I would be glad to answer any questions that the Committee may have.

14 FTC  investigations  of  mergers  and  potentially  anticompetitive  conduct  in  the 
petroleum  industry  have  generally  focused  on  issues  arising  at  the  midstream  and 
downstream  stages  of  the  industry—transportation,  refining,  terminaling,  whole-
saling, and retailing. In view of the minuscule shares of crude oil reserves and pro-
duction held by individual private firms, as well as OPEC’s key role in establishing 
global  crude  oil  supply  and  price  levels,  antitrust  enforcement  opportunities  have 
been  far  less  likely  to  arise  at  the  crude  exploration  and  production  stage.  For  a

www.ftc.gov/os/2002/08/conocophillipsan.htm.  Not  all  oil  industry  merger  activity 
raises competitive concerns. For example, in 2003, the Commission closed its inves-
tigation  of  Sunoco’s  acquisition  of  the  Coastal  Eagle  Point  refinery  in  the  Philadel-
phia area without requiring relief. The Commission noted that the acquisition would 
have  no  anticompetitive  effects  and  seemed  likely  to  yield  substantial  efficiencies 
that  would  benefit  consumers.  Sunoco  Inc./Coastal  Eagle  Point  Oil  Co.,  FTC  File 
No. 031 0139 (Dec. 29, 2003) (Statement of the Commission), at http://www.ftc.gov/ 
os/caselist/0310139/031229stmt0310139.pdf.  The  FTC  also  considered  the  likely 
competitive  effects  of  Phillips  Petroleum’s  proposed  acquisition  of  Tosco.  After  care-
ful  scrutiny,  the  Commission  declined  to  challenge  the  acquisition.  A  statement 
issued  in  connection  with  the  closing  of  the  investigation  set  forth  the  FTC’s  rea-
soning  in  detail.  Phillips  Petroleum  Corp.,  FTC  File  No.  011  0095  (Sept.  17,  2001)

As  noted  above  (supra  note  14),  acquisitions  of  firms  operating  mainly  in  oil  or 
natural  gas  exploration  and  production  are  unlikely  to  raise  antitrust  concerns,  be-
cause that segment of the industry is generally unconcentrated. Acquisitions involv-
ing firms with de minimis market shares, or with production capacity or operations 
that do not overlap geographically, are also unlikely to raise antitrust concerns.

36 Gasoline Price Changes, supra note 7. 
37 A  simple  regression  of  the  monthly  average  national  price  of  gasoline  on  the 
monthly  average  price  of  West  Texas  Intermediate  crude  oil  shows  that  the  vari-
ation in the price of crude oil—based on data for the period January 1984 to October 
2003—explains  approximately  85  percent  of  the  variation  in  the  price  of  gasoline. 
This is similar to the range of effects given in United States Department of Energy/ 
Energy Information Administration, Price Changes in the Gasoline Market: Are Mid-
western  Gasoline  Prices  Downward  Sticky?,  DOE/EIA–0626  (Feb.  1999).  More  com-
plex  regression  analysis  and  more  disaggregated  data  may  give  somewhat  different 
estimates,  but  the  latter  estimates  are  likely  to  be  of  the  same  general  magnitude. 
This  percentage  may  vary  across  states  or  regions.  See  Prepared  Statement  of 
Justine  Hastings  before  the  Committee  on  the  Judiciary,  Subcommittee  on  Anti-
trust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, U.S. Senate, Crude Oil: The Source 
of Higher Gas Prices (Apr. 7, 2004). Dr. Hastings found a range from approximately 
70 percent for California to 91 percent for South Carolina. South Carolina uses only 
conventional  gasoline  and  is  supplied  largely  by  major  product  pipelines  that  pass 
through  the  state  on  their  way  north  from  the  large  refinery  centers  on  the  Gulf 
Coast.  California,  with  its  unique  fuel  specifications  and  its  relative  isolation  from 
refinery centers in other parts of the United States, historically has been more sus-
ceptible  to  supply  disruptions  that  can  cause  major  gasoline  price  changes,  inde-
pendent of crude oil price changes.

40 This phenomenon was not limited to crude oil: other commodities that form the 
basis  for  expanded  growth  in  developing  economies,  such  as  steel  and  lumber,  also

45 ‘‘Real’’ prices are adjusted for inflation and therefore reflect the different values 
of  a  dollar  at  different  times;  they  provide  more  accurate  comparisons  of  prices  in 
different  time  periods.  ‘‘Nominal’’  prices  are  the  literal  prices  shown  at  the  time  of 
purchase. 

46 See Gasoline Price Changes, supra note 7, at 43–47. 
47 The  higher  prices  in  2005  appear  to  be  the  result  of  market  factors  that  have 
uniformly affected the entire country. At least for the part of this year that preceded 
Hurricane Katrina, the FTC’s Gasoline Price Monitoring Project has detected no evi-
dence  of  significant  unusual  local  or  regional  gasoline  pricing  anywhere  in  the 
United States during this summer driving season. This contrasts with the past two 
summers, during which various regional supply shocks, such as the Arizona pipeline 
shutdown  and  the  Northeast  blackouts  of  August  2003,  and  the  several  unantici-
pated  regional  refinery  outages  and  late  summer  hurricanes  during  the  summer  of 
2004,  significantly  increased  prices  in  some  areas  above  levels  that  might  be  ex-
pected based on historical price patterns.

as well as diesel, that can be sold in the United States.

DOE/EIA–0380(1996/01),  Petroleum  Marketing  Monthly  (1996),  and  studies  cited 
therein. Environmental mandates are not the same in all areas of the country. The 
EPA  requires  particular  gasoline  blends  for  certain  geographic  areas,  but  it  some-
times  allows  variations  on  those  blends.  Differing  fuel  specifications  in  different 
areas  can  limit  the  ability  of  gasoline  wholesalers  to  find  adequate  substitutes  in 
the event of a supply shortage. Thus, boutique fuels may exacerbate price variability 
in areas, such as California, that are not interconnected with large refining centers 
in other areas.

Senator INOUYE. I thank you very much, Mr. Seesel. 
Mr. Wells? 

STATEMENT OF JIM WELLS, DIRECTOR, NATURAL RESOURCES 
AND  ENVIRONMENT,  U.S.  GOVERNMENT  ACCOUNTABILITY 
OFFICE 
Mr.  WELLS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members.  We,  too, 

are pleased to be here today. 

We’ve  done  a  lot  of  work  in  gasoline.  We  tried  to  understand 
what’s  going  on.  Quite  frankly,  the  more  we  look,  the  more  we 
would like to look at some other things, too. It’s a very complex in-
dustry,  and  it’s  tough  to  understand  what’s  exactly  happening 
today. But we did accept the challenge to come here in 10 minutes 
and talk about what we think about gasoline prices. 

A  week  after  Katrina,  regular  gasoline  hit  $3.07  a  gallon,  and 
860,000  barrels  per  day  of  production  is  still  closed  in  the  Gulf. 
While  gasoline  prices  have  retreated  somewhat,  just  yesterday, 
Hurricane Rita entered the Gulf, as crude oil futures surged $4, the 
biggest  one-time  jump  ever  in  history  for  one  day.  Heating  oil  and 
gasoline futures have also jumped, as well. 

It’s clear that the pain is real, both for individuals and our econ-
omy.  We  did  a  calculation  of—each  additional  ten  cents  per  gallon 
of  gasoline  adds  $14  billion  to  the—America’s  annual  gasoline  bill. 
That  comes  out  of  your  pocket,  my  pocket.  Our  consumers  have

questions as they fill up their tanks with 380 million gallons a day, 
and then they read the newspapers about high oil company profits. 
This search for potential solutions about ‘‘What do we do?’’ begins 
with  understanding  the  key  factors  relating  to  gas.  We  gave  our 
part  and  tried  to  do  a  gasoline  primer  for  the  American  consumer. 
We put pages together to help the consumer try to understand this 
complex  marketplace.  It  also  depends  on  who  you  ask,  the  people 
that  we  talk  to.  If  you  ask  the  industry,  the  answers  we  got  were, 
‘‘It’s the crude oil cost. It’s the lack of refining capacity. It’s the low 
inventories. It’s supply disruptions. It’s regulatory requirements for 
clean air. It’s the taxes. It’s profit.’’ If you talk to the consumer, you 
hear  from  them,  ‘‘price-gouging,  illegal  activity  or  behavior,  collu-
sion  by  the  industry.’’  If  you  talk  to  an  economist,  ‘‘It’s  all  about 
supply-and-demand  or  some  sort  of  imbalance.’’  If  you  talk  to  a 
GAO auditor, and we would say that ‘‘It’s probably all of the above 
that I just mentioned, and probably more that we’re not aware of.’’ 
On a big-picture level, the price of gasoline is basically—a gallon 
of gasoline consists, from a price standpoint, about half of crude oil, 
a  fourth  for  taxes,  and  a  fourth  for  refining,  marketing,  and  Fed-
eral  and  State  taxes,  as  well  as  profit.  If  you  look  at  it  on  a  more 
detailed level, there are clearly a lot of additional factors that influ-
ence  prices,  such  as  risk  premiums,  fear  premiums,  if  you  will,  fi-
nancial  speculation  in  the  marketplace,  extremely  variable  profit 
margins being observed in the industry, and business targets-of-op-
portunity. 

I think the biggest lesson I learned, as we tried to explain to the 
American people what goes into the price of gasoline, was that the 
price of gasoline has little to do with the cost—what it costs to get 
it,  what  it  costs  to  make  it.  But  it  really  has  a  lot  to  do  with  the 
world market conditions, financial speculation, and how the indus-
try works in today’s environment to move that particular product— 
gasoline—to the market. 

Clearly,  in  10  minutes  I  can’t  talk  about  the  1,001  factors  that 
relate  to  how  the  gasoline  got  priced  as  high  as  it  has  been  today. 
I’m reminded, borrowing from an old car commercial, ‘‘Today’s gas-
oline  marketplace  is  not  your  father’s  old  Oldsmobile.’’  The  indus-
try is vastly different today than it was yesterday. The Federal reg-
ulations,  the  oversight  we  provide,  much  of  what  was  put  in  place 
in  the  1950s,  1960s,  and  1970s  was  meant  to  deal  with  a  market-
place  that  no  longer  exists  today.  The  marketplace  is  clearly  dif-
ferent. 

We  used  to  make  what  gasoline  we  needed  in  this  country. 
Today,  we  import  about  42  million  gallons  a  day,  over  10  percent 
of our need. Not long ago, we had 202,000 gasoline service stations. 
Some of these, many of these, were mom-and-pops. Today, we have 
165,000,  far  fewer  independents.  We  have  fewer  petroleum  compa-
nies  today  than  in  the  past,  because  of  a  wave  of  2,600  mergers 
that  occurred  in  the  1990s.  Industry  used  to  maintain  a  standing 
40-plus days of gasoline inventory in storage. Today, it has 23 days, 
on average, a lot less to deal with immediate disruptions, like what 
we  are  experiencing.  But,  clearly,  it  is  more  cost  efficient  for  the 
industry. 

We  had  over  300  refineries.  Today,  we  have  less  than  150.  Al-
though refining capacity has increased slightly in the last 20 years, 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  15:23 May 10, 2011 Jkt 066218 PO 00000 Frm 00081 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\66218.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

78 

and  that’s  due  primarily  to  the  expansion  of  existing  facilities  and 
the closure of inefficient refineries, but, clearly, the statistics show 
that  it  is  not  keeping  pace  with  the  demand—i.e.,  increasing  im-
ports that we bring in from foreign countries. 

Not  too  many  years  ago,  we  had  one  blend  of  gas.  Today,  for 
clean-air reasons, we have requirements for 11 special blends to be 
sold  in  55  locations  throughout  the  country,  and  it  clearly  costs 
more to provide that type of gas. GAO recently did a study looking 
at special blends. We documented costs in selected areas, anywhere 
from  14  to  44  cents  per  gallon.  In  1970,  we  had  an  average  fuel 
economy  for  cars  at  13  miles  a  gallon.  Today  we  average  22  for 
cars, yet demand continues to rise as we drive more SUVs. 

I  give  you  this  portrayal  of  an  industry  today  that  is  different 
than  it  used  to  be.  In  these  events,  I  do  not  mean  to  portray  that 
they’re necessarily bad, in terms of how the industry has changed, 
but  my  point  is  that  the  industry  and  the  world  has  changed,  and 
questions  remain  whether  the  government  regulations  that  are  in 
place,  and  the  private  industry  can  find  solutions,  and  work  to-
gether  cooperatively,  in  a  partnership  to  find  better  solutions  than 
to put the American consumer and the American economy through 
extreme  volatility  that  they’ve  been  experiencing  in  the  gasoline 
marketplace. 

Everyone around the table today understands that we depend on 
the foreign oil supply, which limits our ability to control things be-
yond our borders. OPEC is currently supplying about 40 percent of 
the  83  million-barrels-per-day  consumption  in  the  world.  If  crude 
prices go up, like 80 percent in the last 15 months, gasoline prices 
will follow, and have followed. Crude oil is clearly a worldwide com-
modity,  and  its  point—its  price  at  any  point  in  time  has  little  to 
do  with  the  cost  to  get  it  out  of  the  ground.  This  is  something  for 
the—that’s  difficult  for  the  consumer  to  understand.  The  price 
today  is  what  the  market  will  bear.  The  last  tanker  of  oil  that 
comes  across  the  ocean  will  steer  to  the  port  that’s  willing  to  pay 
the  highest  price,  whether  that  is  China  or  the  United  States. 
That’s the reality of the marketplace. 

Turning more immediately to the recent events that have caused 
the spread between retail gasoline price and crude oil to widen, we 
have  looked  at  this  and  saw  that  the—historically,  if  you  go  back 
30, 40, 50 years and you track it, the spread was fairly consistent, 
in  terms  of  about  a  50-percent—50-cent-per-gallon  spread  between 
crude  oil  cost  and  retail  price.  Clearly,  refining  capacity  has  not 
kept  pace  with  demand,  and  volatility  has  become  extremely  high. 
There’s no question that the industry has responded. It’s improv-
ing  its  efficiencies,  and  it  has  weeded-out  inefficiencies  by  closing 
refineries.  The  industry,  when  asked  the  question,  ‘‘Why  are  you 
not  building  new  refineries? ’’  they  cite  high  costs,  regulations, 
NIMBY,  and  low  refining  profits  for  reasons  why  no  refineries  are 
being built. 

It  is  true  that,  over  time,  low  and  volatile  margins  have  been  a 
disincentive  to  investing  in  the  refining  sector.  We  would  agree. 
However,  just  prior  to  coming  today,  our  staff  began  compiling 
some  data  that  we  just  got  from  Deutsche  Bank,  and,  looking 
from—back  since  2003,  relating  to  estimates  of  refining  margins, 
which  would  indicate  that  the  U.S.  refining  margins  are  signifi-

cantly higher today than margins in the rest of the world, and are 
increasing. 

The  question  might  be  posed  by  this  Committee  to  the  industry 
later  in  the  panels  that:  If  this  trend  continues  and  if  it’s  sus-
tained,  could  this  be  a  situation  where  the  industry  might  be  in-
spired to increase the U.S. refining capacity, as opposed to some of 
the  reasons  why  they  cited  that  they  were  not  building  refineries 
earlier? 

Mr.  Chairman,  I’m  going  to  stop  here,  and  I’m  going  to  say,  in 
summary, that the future of gasoline prices is uncertain, but, most 
likely,  it  will  remain  higher  than  what  we’ve  been  accustomed  to 
in the past. We would agree with Mr. West’s earlier comment that 
the  marketplace  is  extremely  fragile.  We  agree  with  Senator  Dor-
gan  and  Senator  Allen,  and  others  earlier  today  that  raised  the 
issue  about:  What  are  we  doing  about  price-gouging?  We  agree, 
these are issues and questions that need to be asked. 

Overall,  GAO  would  conclude,  from  the  body  of  work  that  we 
have done, that the challenge is going to be to boost supply and re-
duce  demand.  You  need  to  work  on  both  sides  of  that  equation. 
Clearly,  we  need  to  choose  wisely  our  course  of  actions,  and  we 
need  to  act  soon.  We  also  need  to  stay  vigilant,  in  terms  of  our 
oversight.  As  an  auditor  working  for  you,  the  U.S.  Congress,  and 
the  American  taxpayer,  I  think  it’s  important  that  we  continue  to 
hold Federal agencies accountable, like the Federal Trade Commis-
sion,  Mr.  Seesel  here,  and  the  Justice  Department.  And  we  need 
to make sure that they’re up to the task to, in fact, look at and find 
out  if,  in  fact,  that  the  industry  is  performing  correctly,  and  there 
is  no  price-gouging  going  on.  We,  GAO,  are  ready  to  help,  if  re-
quested. 

I welcome the opportunity to answer any questions. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JIM WELLS, DIRECTOR, NATURAL RESOURCES AND 

ENVIRONMENT, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE 

Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee: 
I am pleased to participate in the Committee’s hearing to discuss current gasoline 
prices and the factors that will likely influence trends in those prices. Soaring retail 
gasoline prices have garnered extensive media attention and generated considerable 
public anxiety in recent months, particularly in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. 
Prices in many areas hit by the hurricane saw retail gasoline prices increase to over 
$3.00  per  gallon,  and  in  one  reported  case  to  almost  $6.00  per  gallon,  with  some 
gasoline stations running out of gasoline entirely. In addition, retail gasoline prices 
have  shot  up  in  many  areas  of  the  country  that  were  not  directly  affected  by  the 
hurricane. It was not uncommon to see pump prices rise not just daily, but multiple 
times  in  the  same  day.  Overall,  gasoline  prices  have  been  significantly  higher  this 
year  than  last,  costing  American  consumers  considerably.  According  to  the  Depart-
ment  of  Energy’s  Energy  Information  Administration  (EIA),  nationally,  each  addi-
tional  ten  cents  per  gallon  of  gasoline  adds  about  $14  billion  to  America’s  annual 
gasoline bill. 

The  availability  of  relatively  inexpensive  gasoline  over  past  decades  has  helped 
foster  economic  growth  and  prosperity  in  the  United  States.  However,  large  price 
increases, especially if sustained over a long period, pose long-term challenges to the 
economy  and  consumers.  Importantly,  some  recent  analyses  suggest  that  gasoline 
prices may stay at today’s relatively high level or even increase significantly in the 
future.  In  contrast,  others  suggest  that  prices  may  fall  as  oil  companies  invest  in 
more  crude  oil  producing  capacity  and  as  consumers  respond  to  higher  prices  by 
adopting  more  energy-efficient  practices.  Regardless  of  what  happens  in  the  future, 
the  impact  of  gasoline  prices  is  felt  in  virtually  every  sector  of  the  U.S.  economy

and  when  prices  increase  sharply,  as  they  have  in  recent  months,  consumers  feel 
it immediately and are reminded every time they fill up their tanks. 

It is therefore essential to understand the market for gasoline. In this context, you 
asked us to discuss: (1) how gasoline prices are determined, and (2) what key factors 
will likely influence trends in future gasoline prices? 

To  respond  to  your  questions,  we  relied  heavily  on  the  gasoline  primer,  ‘‘Motor 
Fuels: Understanding the Factors That Influence the Retail Price of Gasoline,’’ 1 and 
17  other  GAO  products  on  gasoline  prices  and  other  aspects  of  the  petroleum  prod-
ucts industry. (See Related GAO Products at the end of this testimony.) We also col-
lected  updated  data  from  a  number  of  sources  that  we  deemed  reliable.  This  work 
was  performed  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  government  auditing  stand-
ards. 

In summary, our work has shown: 
• Crude  oil  prices  and  gasoline  prices  are  inherently  linked,  because  crude  oil  is 
the primary raw material from which gasoline and other petroleum products are 
produced.  In  the  past  year,  crude  oil  prices  have  risen  significantly—from  Au-
gust  31,  2004  to  August  31,  2005,  the  price  of  West  Texas  Intermediate  crude 
oil,  a  benchmark  for  international  oil  prices,  rose  by  almost  $27  per  barrel,  an 
increase of almost 64 percent. Over about the same period, average retail prices 
for  regular  gasoline  rose  nationally  from  $1.87  to  $2.61  per  gallon,  an  increase 
of  about  40  percent.  Explanations  for  the  large  increase  in  crude  oil  and  gaso-
line  prices  include  the  rapid  growth  in  world  demand  for  crude  oil  and  petro-
leum products, particularly in China and the rest of Asia; instability in the Per-
sian  Gulf  region  (the  source  of  a  large  proportion  of  the  world’s  oil  reserves); 
and  actions  by  the  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (OPEC)  to 
restrict  the  production  of  crude  oil  and  thereby  increase  its  price  on  the  world 
market.  Figure  1  illustrates  the  relationship  between  crude  oil  and  gasoline 
prices  over  the  past  three  decades.  The  figure  shows  that  major  upward  and 
downward  movements  of  crude  oil  prices  are  generally  mirrored  by  movements 
in  the  same  direction  by  gasoline  prices.  However,  based  on  recent  events,  at 
least in the short-term, this historical trend has not held, and retail prices have 
risen faster than crude oil prices.

• While  the  price  and  availability  of  crude  oil  is  a  fundamental  determinant  of 
gasoline  prices,  a  number  of  other  factors  also  play  a  role  in  determining  how 
gasoline prices vary across different locations and over time. For example, refin-
ery capacity in the United States has not expanded at the same pace as demand 
for gasoline and other petroleum products in recent years. During the same pe-
riod the United States has imported larger and larger volumes of gasoline from 
Europe, Canada, and other countries. The American Petroleum Institute has re-
cently  reported  that  U.S.  average  refinery  capacity  utilization  has  increased  to 
92  percent.  As  a  result,  domestic  refineries  have  little  room  to  expand  produc-
tion  in  the  event  of  a  temporary  supply  shortfall.  Further,  the  fact  that  im-
ported  gasoline  comes  from  farther  away  than  domestically  produced  gasoline 
means  that  when  supply  disruptions  occur  in  the  United  States,  it  might  take 
longer  to  get  replacement  gasoline  than  if  we  had  excess  refining  capacity  in 
the  United  States,  and  this  could  cause  gasoline  prices  to  rise  and  stay  high 
until these new supplies can reach the market. 
• Gasoline  inventories  maintained  by  refiners  or  marketers  of  gasoline  can  also 
have  an  impact  on  prices.  As  with  trends  in  a  number  of  other  industries,  the 
petroleum products industry has seen a general downward trend in the level of 
gasoline inventories in the United States. Lower levels of inventories may cause 
prices  to  be  more  volatile  because  when  a  supply  disruption  occurs,  there  are 
fewer stocks of readily available gasoline to draw from, putting upward pressure 
on prices. Regulatory factors also play a role. For example, in order to meet na-
tional air quality standards under the Clean Air Act, as amended, many states 
have  adopted  the  use  of  special  gasoline  blends—so-called  ‘‘Boutique  Fuels.’’ 
Many  experts  have  concluded  that  the  proliferation  of  these  special  gasoline 
blends has caused gasoline prices to rise and/or become more volatile, especially 
in  regions  such  as  California  that  use  unique  blends  of  gasoline,  because  the 
fuels  have  increased  the  complexity  and  costs  associated  with  supplying  gaso-
line  to  all  the  different  markets.  Finally,  the  structure  of  the  gasoline  market 
can  play  a  role  in  determining  prices.  For  example,  we  recently  reported  that 
some  mergers  of  oil  companies  during  the  1990s  led  to  reduced  competition 
among gasoline suppliers and may have been responsible for an increase in gas-
oline  prices  by  as  much  as  2  cents  per  gallon  on  average,  with  boutique  fuels 
increasing from between 1 to 7 cents per gallon.

• Gasoline prices may also be affected by unexpected refinery outages or accidents 
that  significantly  disrupt  the  delivery  of  gasoline  supply.  Most  recently,  Hurri-
cane  Katrina  hit  the  Gulf  Coast,  doing  tremendous  damage  to  homes,  busi-
nesses,  and  physical  infrastructure,  including  roads;  electricity  transmission 
lines;  and  oil  producing,  refining,  and  pipeline  facilities.  The  DOE  reported  on 
August 31, 2005, that as many as 2.3 million customers were without electricity 
in  Louisiana,  Mississippi,  Alabama,  Florida,  and  Georgia.  The  DOE  further  re-
ported  that  21  refineries  in  affected  states  were  either  shut  down  or  operating 
at  reduced  capacity  in  the  aftermath  of  the  hurricane.  This  amounted  to  a  re-
duction of over 10 percent of the Nation’s total refining capacity. Two petroleum 
product pipelines that serve the Midwest and East Coast from Gulf Coast refin-
eries  were  also  out.  In  addition,  the  Minerals  Management  Service  in  the  De-
partment of the Interior reported that as of September 1, 2005, over 90 percent 
of  crude  oil  production  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  was  out  of  operation.  Because  the 
Gulf  Coast  refining  region  is  a  net  exporter  of  petroleum  products  to  all  other 
regions  of  the  country,  retail  gasoline  prices  in  many  parts  of  the  Nation  rose 
dramatically.  Average  retail  gasoline  prices  increased  45  cents  per  gallon  be-
tween  August  29  and  September  5.  The  average  price  for  a  gallon  of  regular 
gasoline on September 5 was $3.07, the highest nominal price ever. In addition, 
gasoline  stations  faced  large  increases  in  wholesale  gasoline  prices,  and  some 
even reported running out of gasoline. The spot price for wholesale gasoline de-
livered  to  New  York  Harbor  rose  by  about  $0.78  per  gallon  between  August  26 
and  August  30.  Gasoline  supply  is  recovering  in  the  wake  of  the  storm,  how-
ever,  and  prices  have  begun  to  decrease.  Between  September  5  and  September 
12, average gasoline prices decreased 11 cents to $2.96 per gallon. Gasoline pro-
duction increased dramatically over this time, rising by more than 400,000 bar-
rels  per  day  as  most  of  the  refineries  shut  down  after  the  storm  resumed  pro-
duction.  Until  production,  refining,  and  pipeline  facilities  are  fully  operating  at 
normal  levels,  prices  are  expected  to  continue  to  be  higher  in  affected  areas. 
Coming as this has on the heels of a period of high crude oil prices and a tight 
balance  worldwide  between  petroleum  demand  and  supply,  the  effects  of  the 
hurricane  illustrate  the  volatility  of  gasoline  prices  given  the  vulnerability  of 
the gasoline infrastructure to natural or other disruptions. 

• Future  gasoline  prices  will  reflect  the  world  supply-and-demand  balance.  If  de-
mand  for  oil  and  petroleum  products  continues  to  rise  as  it  has  in  past  years, 
then  oil  supply  will  have  to  expand  significantly  to  keep  up.  The  EIA  projects 
that  world  demand  for  crude  oil  will  rise  by  at  least  25  percent  by  the  year 
2025.  However,  world  surplus  crude  oil  production  capacity—the  amount  by 
which  oil  production  can  be  increased  in  the  short  run  without  installing  more 
drilling  equipment  or  developing  new  oil  fields—is  currently  very  small.  More-
over,  many  of  the  world’s  known  and  easily  accessible  crude  oil  deposits  have 
already  been  developed  and  many  of  these  are  experiencing  declining  volumes 
as the fields become depleted. Other new sources may be more expensive to de-
velop. For example, there are large stores of crude oil in tar sands and oil shale, 
or potentially beneath deep water in the ocean, but these sources are more cost-
ly  to  extract  and  process  than  many  of  the  sources  of  oil  that  we  have  already 
tapped. If developing, extracting, and refining new sources of crude oil are more 
costly  than  extracting  and  refining  oil  from  existing  fields,  crude  oil  and  petro-
leum  product  prices  likely  will  rise  to  make  these  activities  economically  fea-
sible. If, on the other hand, technological innovations improve the ability to ex-
tract  and  process  oil,  this  will  increase  the  available  future  supply  and  may 
ease pressure on petroleum product prices. 

• Although  demand  for  crude  oil  is  projected  to  increase,  it  could  fall  below  cur-
rent  expectations  if  consumers  choose  more  energy  efficient  products  or  other-
wise  conserve  more  energy.  Such  a  reduction  in  demand  could  lead  to  lower- 
than-expected future prices. For example, in response to high gasoline prices in 
the  United  States,  in  the  1980s  many  consumers  chose  to  switch  to  smaller  or 
more fuel-efficient vehicles, which reduced demand for gasoline. Environmental 
issues  could  also  have  an  impact  on  world  crude  oil  and  petroleum  product 
prices.  For  example,  international  efforts  to  reduce  greenhouse  emissions  could 
cause  reductions  in  demand  for  crude  oil  and  petroleum  products  as  more  fuel- 
efficient  processes  are  adopted  or  as  cleaner  sources  of  energy  are  developed. 
Additional  factors  that  will  likely  influence  future  oil  and  gasoline  prices  in-
clude geopolitical issues, such as the stability of the Middle East; the valuation 
of  the  U.S.  dollar  in  world  currency  markets;  and  the  pace  of  development  of 
alternative energy supplies, such as hydrogen fuel cell technology.

Background 

83 

In  2004,  the  United  States  consumed  about  20.5  million  barrels  per  day  of  crude 
oil  accounting  for  roughly  25  percent  of  world  oil  production.  A  great  deal  of  the 
crude oil consumed in this country goes into production of gasoline and, as a nation, 
we use about 45 percent of all gasoline produced in the world.2 Products made from 
crude  oil—petroleum  products,  including  gasoline—have  been  instrumental  in  the 
development of our modern lifestyle. In particular, gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel have 
provided the Nation with affordable fuel for automobiles, trucks, airplanes and other 
forms  of  public  and  goods  transportation.  Together,  these  fuels  account  for  over  98 
percent  of  the  U.S.  transportation  sector’s  fuel  consumption.  In  addition,  petroleum 
products  are  used  as  raw  materials  in  manufacturing  and  industry;  for  heating 
homes  and  businesses;  and,  in  small  amounts,  for  generating  electric  power.  Gaso-
line  use  alone  constitutes  about  44  percent  of  our  consumption  of  petroleum  prod-
ucts  in  the  United  States,  so  when  gasoline  prices  rise,  as  they  have  in  recent 
months, the effects are felt throughout the country, increasing the costs of producing 
and delivering basic retail goods and making it more expensive to commute to work. 
It is often the case that prices of other petroleum products also increase at the same 
time  and  for  the  same  reasons  that  gasoline  prices  rise.  For  example,  today’s  high 
gasoline  prices  are  mirrored  by  high  jet  fuel  prices,  creating  financial  pressure  on 
airline companies, some of which are currently in the midst of economic difficulties. 
Gasoline  prices  vary  a  great  deal  over  time.  For  example,  in  the  period  January  1, 
1995  through  August  29,  2005,  the  national  average  price  for  a  gallon  of  regular 
grade gasoline has been as low as $1.10 and as high as $2.80 without adjusting for 
inflation. 

The  future  path  of  gasoline  prices  is  difficult  to  predict,  but  it  is  clear  that  the 
use  of  petroleum  products  worldwide  is  going  to  increase  for  the  near  term  and 
maybe  beyond.  Some  analysts  have  predicted  much  higher  crude  oil  prices—and  as 
a  result,  higher  prices  for  petroleum  products—while  others  expect  prices  to  mod-
erate  as  producers  respond  to  high  prices  by  producing  more  crude  oil  and  con-
sumers respond by conserving more, and investing in more energy-efficient cars and 
other products. In either case, the price of gasoline will continue to be an important 
factor  affecting  the  household  budgets  of  individual  Americans  for  the  foreseeable 
future  and  therefore,  it  is  important  to  understand  how  prices  are  determined  so 
that consumers can make wise choices. 
Gasoline  Prices  Are  Determined  by  the  Price  of  Crude  Oil  and  a  Number 

of Other Factors 

Crude  oil  prices  directly  affect  the  price  of  gasoline,  because  crude  oil  is  the  pri-
mary  raw  material  from  which  gasoline  is  produced.  For  example,  according  to  our 
analysis  of  EIA  data,  in  2004  crude  oil  accounted  for  about  48  percent  of  the  price 
of  a  gallon  of  gasoline  on  average  in  the  United  States.  When  crude  oil  prices  rise, 
as  they  have  over  the  past  year,  refiners  find  their  cost  of  producing  gasoline  also 
rises,  and  in  general,  these  higher  costs  are  passed  on  to  consumers  in  the  form  of 
higher gasoline prices at the pump. However, based on recent events, at least in the 
short-term,  this  historical  trend  has  not  held,  and  retail  prices  have  risen  faster 
than  crude  oil  prices.  Figure  2  illustrates  the  importance  of  crude  oil  in  the  price 
of  gasoline.  The  figure  also  shows  that  taxes,  refining,  and  distribution  and  mar-
keting also play important roles.3 

2 The  large  percentage  of  total  world  gasoline  production  consumed  by  the  United  States,  in 
part, reflects the fact that diesel is a commonly used fuel for cars in Europe, while automobiles 
in  the  United  States  primarily  run  on  gasoline.  If  all  motor  vehicle  fuels  were  accounted  for, 
the  United  States’  share  of  these  fuels  would  be  smaller  than  its  share  of  gasoline.  However, 
we do not have the data to present this more comprehensive measure. 

3 The latter two categories, refining and distribution and marketing, includes costs associated 
with  these  activities  as  well  as  profits.  The  figure  is  a  snapshot  of  how  much  each  component 
contributes  to  the  price  of  a  gallon  of  gasoline,  and  how  the  relative  proportions  attributable 
to each component vary over time as crude oil prices and other factors change.

Because crude oil is the primary raw material used in the production of gasoline, 
understanding  what  determines  gasoline  prices  requires  examining  how  crude  oil 
prices  are  set.  Overall,  the  price  of  crude  oil  is  determined  by  the  balance  between 
world demand and supply. A major cause of rising crude oil prices in recent months 
has been rapid growth in world demand, without a similar growth in available sup-
plies. In particular, the economy of China has grown rapidly in recent years, leading 
to  increases  in  their  demand  for  crude  oil.  In  contrast,  oil  production  capacity  has 
grown more slowly, leading to a reduction in surplus capacity—the amount of crude 
oil  that  is  left  in  the  ground,  but  could  be  extracted  on  short  notice  in  the  event 
of  a  supply  shortfall.  EIA  has  stated  that  the  world’s  surplus  crude  oil  production 
capacity  has  fallen  to  about  one  million  barrels  per  day,  or  just  over  1  percent  of 
the  world’s  current  daily  consumption,  making  the  balance  between  world  demand 
and  supply  of  crude  oil  very  tight.  This  tight  balance  between  world  crude  oil  de-
mand  and  supply  means  that  any  significant  supply  disruptions  will  likely  cause 
prices to rise. Such a disruption occurred in Nigeria in October 2004, when a work-
ers’ strike in Nigeria’s oil sector forced world crude oil prices to record highs. (Nige-
ria is the world’s seventh largest oil producer, supplying an average 2.5 million bar-
rels per day in 2004.) 

Another  important  factor  affecting  crude  oil  prices  is  the  behavior  of  the  Organi-
zation  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (OPEC)—members  of  which  include  Alge-
ria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab 
Emirates, and Venezuela. OPEC members produce almost 40 percent of the world’s 
crude  oil  and  control  almost  70  percent  of  the  world’s  proven  oil  reserves.  In  the 
recent  past  and  on  numerous  other  occasions,  OPEC  members  have  collectively 
agreed to restrict the production of crude oil in order to increase world prices. 

Turning now to the price of gasoline seen at the pump, it is important to discuss 
the  role  of  taxes.  In  the  United  States,  on  average,  taxes  accounted  for  23  percent 
of  what  consumers  paid  for  a  gallon  of  gasoline  in  2004,  according  to  EIA’s  data. 
This  percentage  includes  estimated  Federal  and  average  state  taxes  totaling  44 
cents per gallon (see Figure 3).4 Federal taxes accounted for 18.4 cents of this total, 
while state taxes averaged 25.6 cents per gallon, although taxes vary among states. 

4 EIA uses tax data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) for its tax analysis. Accord-

cable  fees  but  largely  exclude  local  taxes,  which  may  average  about  2  cents  per  gallon  nation-
wide.

Differences  in  gasoline  taxes  across  states  help  explain  why  gasoline  prices  vary 
from  place  to  place  in  the  United  States.  In  addition  to  Federal  taxes  that  apply 
across the board, states and, in some cases, local jurisdictions also impose taxes and 
other fees on gasoline that add to the price. Figure 4 shows total state and Federal 
gasoline taxes for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, as of November 
2004. New York, Hawaii, and California have the highest total gasoline taxes, while 
Alaska, Wyoming, and New Jersey have the lowest. While differences in taxes affect 
the price of gasoline, there is no consistent relationship between high taxes and high 
prices. For example, on March 7, 2005, gasoline cost $1.91 per gallon in North Caro-
lina  and  $1.98  per  gallon  in  Alaska,  even  though  the  taxes  paid  in  North  Carolina 
were almost 17 cents per gallon higher.

In addition to the cost of crude oil, taxes, refining, and distribution and marketing 
costs,  gasoline  prices  are  influenced  by  a  variety  of  other  factors.  These  include  re-
fining capacity constraints, low inventories, unexpected refinery or pipeline outages, 
environmental  and  other  regulations,  and  mergers  and  market  power  in  the  oil  in-
dustry. 

First, domestic refining capacity has not kept pace with growing demand for gaso-
line. As demand has grown faster than domestic refining capacity, the United States 
has  imported  larger  and  larger  volumes  of  gasoline  and  other  petroleum  products 
from  refiners  in  Europe,  Canada,  and  other  countries.  EIA  officials  told  us  that,  in

general,  this  increase  in  imports  has  reflected  the  availability  of  gasoline  from  for-
eign  sources  at  lower  cost  than  could  be  achieved  by  building  and  operating  addi-
tional refining capacity in the United States. However, the American Petroleum In-
stitute  (API)  has  recently  reported  that  capacity  utilization  has  been  high  in  the 
U.S.  refinery  sector.  Refining  capacity  has  typically  averaged  over  90  percent,  and 
has recently increased to 92 percent—much higher than the rate in many other in-
dustries that API reports as more typically operating at around 80 percent of capac-
ity.  As  a  result,  domestic  refineries  have  little  room  to  expand  production  in  the 
event of a temporary supply shortfall. Furthermore, the fact that imported gasoline 
comes from farther away than domestically produced gasoline means that when sup-
ply  disruptions  occur  in  the  United  States,  it  might  take  longer  to  get  replacement 
gasoline than if we had excess refining capacity in the United States, and this could 
cause  gasoline  prices  to  rise  and  stay  high  until  these  new  supplies  can  reach  the 
market. 

Second, the level of gasoline inventories can also play an important role in deter-
mining  gasoline  prices  over  time  because  inventories  represent  the  most  accessible 
and  available  source  of  supply  in  the  event  of  a  production  shortfall  or  increase  in 
demand.  Similar  to  trends  in  other  industries,  the  level  of  gasoline  inventories  has 
been falling for a number of years. In part, this reflects a trend in business to more 
closely balance production with demand in order to reduce the cost of holding large 
reserves.  However,  reduced  inventories  may  contribute  to  increased  price  volatility, 
because  when  unexpected  supply  disruptions  or  increases  in  demand  occur,  there 
are lower stocks of readily available gasoline upon which to draw. This puts upward 
pressure on gasoline prices until new supplies can be refined and delivered domesti-
cally, or imported from abroad. 

Third, gasoline prices may be affected by unexpected refinery outages or accidents 
that  significantly  disrupt  the  delivery  of  gasoline  supply.  Most  recently,  Hurricane 
Katrina  hit  the  Gulf  Coast,  doing  tremendous  damage  to  homes,  businesses,  and 
physical  infrastructure,  including  roads;  electricity  transmission  lines;  and  oil  pro-
ducing, refining, and pipeline facilities. The DOE reported on August 31, 2005, that 
as many as 2.3 million customers were without electricity in Louisiana, Mississippi, 
Alabama,  Florida,  and  Georgia.  The  DOE  further  reported  that  21  refineries  in  af-
fected  states  were  either  shut  down  or  operating  at  reduced  capacity  in  the  after-
math  of  the  hurricane.  The  refining  capacity  of  the  shutdown  refineries  alone  is 
equivalent to over 10 percent of the Nation’s total refining capacity. Two petroleum 
product pipelines that serve the Midwest and East Coast from Gulf Coast refineries 
were also out. The Minerals Management Service of the Department of the Interior 
reported  that  as  of  September  1,  2005,  over  90  percent  of  crude  oil  production  in 
the  Gulf  of  Mexico  was  out  of  operation.  Because  the  Gulf  Coast  refining  region  is 
a net exporter of petroleum products to all other regions of the country, retail gaso-
line  prices  in  many  parts  of  the  Nation  have  risen  dramatically,  with  news  reports 
that many locations have seen prices over $3.00 per gallon, and in one reported case 
to  almost  $6.00  per  gallon.  In  addition,  many  gasoline  stations  have  reported  run-
ning  out  of  stocks  and  have  faced  large  increases  in  wholesale  gasoline  prices—the 
spot price for wholesale gasoline delivered to New York Harbor rose by about $0.78 
per  gallon  between  August  26  and  August  30.  Until  production,  refining,  and  pipe-
line facilities are back up and running at normal levels, prices are expected to con-
tinue  to  be  higher  in  affected  areas.  Coming  as  this  has  on  the  heels  of  a  period 
of  high  crude  oil  prices  and  a  tight  balance  worldwide  between  petroleum  demand 
and  supply,  the  effects  of  the  hurricane  illustrate  the  volatility  of  gasoline  prices 
given the vulnerability of the gasoline infrastructure to natural or other disruptions. 
Such disruptions also have the potential to adversely affect the economy. For exam-
ple,  in  2004,  the  International  Energy  Agency  reported  that  a  $10  increase  in  the 
world price of crude oil would lead to at least a one half percent reduction in world 
GDP—equivalent  to  $255  billion—in  the  year  following  the  price  increase.  The  ef-
fects  on  individual  countries  would  vary  depending  on  whether  or  not  they  are  net 
oil importers and on the level of energy intensity of their economies. 

Fourth, regulatory steps to reduce air pollution have also influenced gasoline mar-
kets  and  consequently  have  increased  gasoline  prices.  For  example,  since  the  1990 
amendments to the Clean Air Act, the use of various blends of cleaner-burning gaso-
line—so-called  ‘‘boutique  fuels—has  grown  as  states  have  adopted  the  use  of  such 
fuels to meet national air quality standards. The use of these special blends has pro-
vided  environmental  and  health  benefits  by  reducing  emissions  of  a  number  of  pol-
lutants.  However,  the  proliferation  of  these  special  gasoline  blends  has  also  put 
stress on the gasoline supply infrastructure and has led to increased price volatility

88 

because  areas  that  use  special  blends  cannot  as  easily  find  suitable  replacement 
gasoline in the event of a local supply disruption.5 

Finally,  we  recently  reported  that  industry  mergers  increased  market  concentra-
tion and in some cases caused higher wholesale gasoline prices in the United States 
from  the  mid-1990s  through  2000.6 Overall,  the  report  found  that  the  mergers  led 
to  price  increases  averaging  about  2  cents  per  gallon  on  average.  For  conventional 
gasoline,  the  predominant  type  used  in  the  country,  the  change  in  the  wholesale 
price,  due  to  specific  mergers,  ranged  from  a  decrease  of  about  1  cent  per  gallon— 
due  to  efficiency  gains  associated  with  the  merger—to  an  increase  of  about  5  cents 
per  gallon—attributed  to  increased  market  power  after  the  merger.  For  special 
blends  of  gasoline,  wholesale  prices  increased  by  from  between  1  and  7  cents  per 
gallon, depending on location. 
Future  Oil  and  Gasoline  Prices  Will  Reflect  Supply/Demand  Balance,  but 

Technological Change and Conservation Will Also Play a Role 

Looking into the future, daunting challenges lie ahead in finding, developing, and 
providing  sufficient  quantities  of  oil  to  meet  projected  global  demand.  For  example, 
according to EIA, world oil demand is expected to grow to nearly 103 million barrels 
per day in 2025 under low growth assumptions, and may reach as high as 142 mil-
lion barrels per day in 2025—increases of between 25 and 71 percent from the 2004 
consumption  level  of  83  million  barrels  per  day.  Looking  further  ahead,  the  rapid 
pace  of  economic  growth  in  China  and  India,  two  of  the  world’s  most  populous  and 
fastest  growing  countries,  may  lead  to  a  rapid  increase  in  their  demand  for  crude 
oil  and  petroleum  products.  While  current  consumption  of  oil  by  China  and  India 
is  far  below  that  of  the  United  States,  it  is  projected  to  grow  at  a  far  more  rapid 
rate.  Specifically,  EIA’s  medium-growth  projections  estimate  that  oil  consumption 
for China and India will each grow by about 4 percent annually through 2025, while 
consumption in the United States is projected to grow at an annual rate of 1.5 per-
cent over the same period. 

To meet the rising demand for gasoline and other petroleum products, new oil de-
posits  will  likely  be  developed  and  new  production  facilities  built.  Currently,  many 
of  the  world’s  known  and  easily  accessible  crude  oil  deposits  have  already  been  de-
veloped, and many of these are experiencing declining volumes as fields become de-
pleted. For example, the existing oil fields in California and Alaska have long since 
reached their peak production, necessitating an increasing volume of imported crude 
oil  to  West  Coast  refineries.  Developing  new  oil  deposits  may  be  more  costly  than 
in  the  past,  which  could  put  upward  pressure  on  crude  oil  prices  and  the  prices  of 
petroleum products derived from it. For example, some large potential new sources, 
such  as  oil  shales,  tar  sands,  and  deep-water  oil  wells,  require  different  and  more 
costly  extraction  methods  than  are  typically  needed  to  extract  oil  from  existing 
fields.  In  addition,  the  remaining  oil  in  the  ground  may  be  heavier  and  more  dif-
ficult  to  refine,  necessitating  investment  in  additional  refinery  processes  to  make 
gasoline  and  other  petroleum  products  out  of  this  oil.  If  developing,  extracting,  and 
refining  new  sources  of  crude  oil  are  more  costly  than  extracting  and  refining  oil 
from  existing  fields,  crude  oil  and  petroleum  product  prices  likely  will  rise  to  make 
these activities economically feasible. 

On the other hand, technological advances in oil exploration, extraction, and refin-
ing  could  mitigate  future  price  increases.  In  the  past,  advances  in  seismic  tech-
nology significantly improved the ability of oil exploration companies to map oil de-
posits, while improvements in drilling technology have enabled oil companies to drill 
in multiple directions from a single platform. Together, these advances have enabled 
companies to identify and extract oil more efficiently, essentially increasing the sup-
ply of oil. Further, refining advances over the years have also enabled U.S. refiners 
to  increase  the  yield  of  gasoline  from  a  given  barrel  of  oil—while  the  total  volume 
of  petroleum  products  has  remained  relatively  constant,  refiners  have  been  able  to 
get  a  greater  proportion  of  the  more  valuable  components,  such  as  gasoline,  out  of 
each  barrel,  thereby  increasing  the  supply  of  these  components.  Similar  techno-
logical  improvements  in  the  future  that  lower  costs  or  increase  supply  of  crude  oil 
or refined products would likely lead to lower prices for such commodities. 

Innovations  that  reduce  the  costs  of  alternative  sources  of  energy  could  also  re-
duce the demand for crude oil and petroleum products, and thereby ease price pres-
sures. For example, hydrogen is the simplest element and most plentiful gas in the

universe  and  when  used  in  fuel  cells  produce  almost  no  pollution.  In  addition,  hy-
drogen fuel cell cars are expected to be roughly three times more fuel-efficient than 
cars powered by typical internal combustion engines. Currently, enormous technical 
problems  stand  in  the  way  of  converting  America’s  fleet  of  automobiles  from  gaso-
line to hydrogen, including how to produce, store, and distribute the flammable gas 
safely  and  efficiently,  and  how  to  build  hydrogen  cars  that  people  can  afford  and 
will want to buy. However, there are Federal and state initiatives under way as well 
as many private efforts to solve these technical problems, and if they can be solved 
in  an  economical  way  in  the  future,  the  implications  for  gasoline  use  could  be  pro-
found. 

Greater conservation or improved fuel efficiency could also reduce future demand 
for  crude  oil  and  petroleum  products,  thereby  leading  to  lower  prices.  The  amount 
of oil and petroleum products we will consume in the future is, ultimately, a matter 
of  choice.  Reducing  our  consumption  of  gasoline  by  driving  smaller,  more  fuel-effi-
cient  cars—as  occurred  in  the  1980s  in  response  to  high  gasoline  prices—would  re-
duce  future  demand  for  gasoline  and  put  downward  pressure  on  prices.  For  exam-
ple, the National Academies of Science recently reported that if fuel-efficiency stand-
ards for cars and light trucks had been raised by an additional 15 percent in 2000, 
gasoline  consumption  in  the  year  2015  would  be  10  billion  gallons  lower  than  it  is 
expected  to  be  under  current  standards.  The  Congress  established  fuel  economy 
standards  for  passenger  cars  and  light  trucks  in  1975  with  the  passage  of  the  En-
ergy Policy and Conservation Act. While these standards have led to increased fuel 
efficiency  for  cars  and  light  trucks,  in  recent  years,  the  switch  to  light  trucks  has 
eroded  gains  in  the  overall  fuel  efficiency  of  the  fleet  of  American  passenger  vehi-
cles.  Future  reductions  in  demand  for  gasoline  could  be  achieved  if  either  fuel  effi-
ciency  standards  for  cars  and  light  trucks  are  increased,  or  if  consumers  switch  to 
driving smaller or more fuel-efficient cars. 

The effect of future environmental regulations and international initiatives on oil 
and petroleum products prices is uncertain. On one hand, regulations that increase 
the  cost  or  otherwise  limit  the  building  of  refining  and  storage  capacity  may  put 
pressure  on  prices  in  some  localities.  For  example,  the  California  Energy  Commis-
sion told us the lack of storage capacity for imported crude oil and petroleum prod-
ucts may be a severe problem in the future, potentially leading to supply disruptions 
and  price  volatility.  Alternatively,  international  efforts  to  reduce  the  generation  of 
greenhouse  gas  emissions  could  cause  reductions  in  the  demand  for  crude  oil  and 
petroleum  products  through  the  development  and  use  of  more  fuel-efficient  proc-
esses and as cleaner, lower-emissions fuels are developed and used. 

Moreover,  geopolitical  factors  will  likely  continue  to  have  an  impact  on  the  price 
of crude oil and petroleum products in the future. Because crude oil is a global com-
modity, the price we pay for it can be affected by any events that may affect world 
demand or supply. For example, Venezuela—which produces around 2.6 million bar-
rels  of  crude  oil  per  day,  and  which  supplies  about  12  percent  of  total  U.S.  oil  im-
ports—is  currently  experiencing  considerable  social,  economic,  and  political  difficul-
ties that have, in the past, impacted oil production. Finally, instability in the Middle 
East,  and  particularly  the  Persian  Gulf,  has  in  the  past,  caused  major  disruptions 
in oil supplies, such as occurred toward the end of the first Gulf War, when Kuwaiti 
oil wells were destroyed by Iraq. 

Finally,  the  value  of  the  U.S.  dollar  on  open  currency  markets  could  also  affect 
future  crude  oil  prices.  For  example,  because  crude  oil  is  typically  denominated  in 
U.S. dollars, the payments that oil-producing countries receive for their oil are also 
denominated  in  U.S.  dollars.  As  a  result,  a  weak  U.S.  dollar  decreases  the  value  of 
the  oil  sold  at  a  given  price.  Some  analysts  have  recently  reported  in  the  popular 
press  that  this  devaluation  can  influence  long-term  prices  in  two  ways.  First,  oil- 
producing countries may wish to increase prices for their crude oil in order to main-
tain their purchasing power in the face of a weakening U.S. dollar. Second, because 
the  dollars  that  these  countries  have  accumulated,  which  they  use,  in  part,  to  fi-
nance  additional  oil  exploration  and  extraction,  are  worth  less,  the  costs  they  pay 
to  purchase  technology  and  equipment  from  other  countries  whose  currencies  have 
gained  relative  to  the  dollar  will  increase.  Such  higher  costs  may  deter  further  ex-
pansion of oil production, leading to even higher oil prices.7 

7 Higher  oil  prices,  because  they  increase  the  U.S.  trade  deficit,  may  also  contribute  to  the 
further  devaluation  of  the  dollar.  Hence,  analysts  have  called  this  process  a  vicious  cycle  in 
which  a  weak  dollar  drives  up  oil  prices,  which  then  feeds  back  into  the  trade  deficit  causing 
the dollar to weaken further.

Conclusions 

90 

In  closing,  the  wide-ranging  effects  of  Hurricane  Katrina  on  gasoline  prices  na-
tionwide are a stark illustration of the interconnectedness of our petroleum markets 
and  reveal  the  vulnerability  of  these  markets  to  disruptions,  natural  or  otherwise. 
Current U.S. energy supplies remain highly dependent on fossil energy sources that 
are costly, largely imported, and potentially harmful to the environment. No matter 
what  the  price  of  petroleum  is,  alternative  energy  options  seem  always  to  remain 
uneconomic.  Striking  a  balance  between  efforts  to  boost  petroleum  supply,  provide 
incentives  for  developing  of  alternative  energy  sources,  develop  policies  and  tech-
nologies focused on improving the fuel efficiency of petroleum burning vehicles, and 
promote  overall  energy  conservation,  presents  challenges  as  well  as  opportunities. 
Clearly, all providers and consumers of energy need to get serious about conserving 
energy.  The  challenge  is  to  boost  supply  and  reduce  demand.  We  need  to  choose 
wisely  and  we  need  to  act  soon.  How  we  choose  to  meet  the  challenges  and  seize 
the  opportunities  will  help  determine  our  quality  of  life  and  economic  prosperity  in 
the future. 

We  are  currently  studying  the  determinants  of  gasoline  prices  in  particular,  and 
the  petroleum  industry  more  generally,  including  an  evaluation  of  world  oil  re-
serves;  an  assessment  of  the  security  of  maritime  facilities  for  handling  and  trans-
porting petroleum, natural gas, and petroleum products; an analysis of the viability 
of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; and an assessment of the impacts of a potential 
disruption  of  Venezuelan  oil  imports.  With  this  body  of  work,  we  hope  to  continue 
to  provide  Congress  and  the  American  people  the  information  needed  to  make  in-
formed  decisions  about  energy  that  will  have  far-reaching  effects  on  our  economy 
and our way of life. 

Mr.  Chairman,  this  completes  my  prepared  statement.  I  would  be  happy  to  re-
spond  to  any  questions  you  or  the  other  members  of  the  Committee  may  have  at 
this time.

Senator INOUYE. Thank you very much, Mr. Wells. 
Senator Pryor? 
Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr.  Chairman,  before  I  start,  if  this  doesn’t  work  against  my 
time,  did  we  ask  the  FTC  Chairman  to  be  here  today,  or—I  mean, 
no offense to Mr.—oh, this afternoon? This afternoon, OK. 

Mr. Chairman, thank you. And, if I may, let me start with our— 
John  Seesel  from  the  FTC,  and  that  is,  I’ve  seen  some  conflicting 
testimony  from  different  people.  I  think  in  the  Maryland  House  of 
Representatives,  they  have  a  committee  on  economic  matters,  and 
apparently  someone  from  the  oil  industry  there  testified  that  one 
of  the  reasons—maybe  the  reason—that  Maryland  was  paying 
higher prices is because they were so dependent on the pipeline to 
get  their  petroleum.  And,  in  Delaware,  apparently  there  was  simi-
lar  inquiry—I  think  maybe  this  was  just  a  newspaper  question— 
about  why.  And,  in  Delaware,  they  said  that  there  are  refineries 
in Delaware, and the reason prices were so high in Delaware is be-
cause  they  do  not  rely  on  the  pipeline.  Have  you  seen  these  types 
of statements? 

Mr. SEESEL. Senator Pryor, I haven’t seen those statements. I do 
know  that  this  particular  part  of  the  country  we’re  in  right  now— 
and  I’m  sure  we’ve  all  read  quite  a  bit  about  this—was  quite  af-
fected  by  the  Colonial  and  Plantation  Pipeline  problems  that  oc-
curred  right  after  Hurricane  Katrina.  So,  the  whole  mid-Atlantic 
area,  really  stretching  up  toward  the  area  of  New  York,  I  think, 
which  depends  a  lot  on  supply  through  those  very  important  prod-
uct  pipelines,  was  affected.  And  probably—at  least  that  particular 
short-term  impact  would  have  affected  Maryland  and  Delaware  in 
the  same  way.  But  I  haven’t—I  haven’t—I’m  not  familiar  with  the 
proceedings you’re citing. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Just  when  I  hear  the  industry  say  those  kind  of 
things, it sounds like double-talk to me, and I think it does to most 
Americans. They just feel like they’re not getting a straight answer 
on  that.  So,  when  I  hear  that,  I  just  think  that’s  inconsistent,  and 
I don’t always understand. But thank you for your assistance with 
the  FTC  and  the  investigation  that,  hopefully,  you’ll  do,  assuming 
the President signs that. 

Let  me  ask  this  question  about  gas,  the  price  of  a  gallon  of  gas. 
I’ve  heard  different  figures,  but,  basically,  as  I  understand  it,  the 
crude oil price in a gallon of gas is—and, again, I hear different fig-
ures, but one figure I have is only 55 percent of the price of a gal-
lon  of  gas,  and  that  refining  is  about  18  percent,  distribution  and 
marketing  is  about  8  percent,  taxes  are  about  19  percent.  Now,  I 
hear  different  fluctuations  in  that,  but  I  was  curious  if  either  one 
of  you  know  if  there’s  a  definitive  number  there,  in  what  really 
makes  up  a  price  of  gasoline.  And  maybe  it  depends  on  the  price 
of the gallon so that you can assign percentages. But, do either one 
of you all have an answer on that?

Mr. WELLS. Senator Pryor, we did a body of work relating to try-
ing  to  explain  what  it  costs  in  a  gallon  of  gasoline.  We  relied  on 
Federal statistics that are available to us. We tried to take the en-
tire  average  price  that  was  occurring  nationwide  over  an  entire 
year,  2004,  and  we,  too,  came  up  with  the  similar  numbers—48 
percent was crude; 23, tax; 17, refinery; 12 percent, marketing. But 
you  also  have  to  realize  that  these  are  points  in  time  over  a  given 
year. Many of the numbers will vary all over the ballpark, depend-
ing on whether you pick a time when the price is high, in the sum-
mer,  or  lower,  in  the  winter,  so  you  will  have—but  they’re,  rel-
atively, pretty close. 

The  uncertainty  is  relating  to  the  softer  areas  of  that  equation. 
Clearly, we can document taxes without looking at the IRS tax re-
turns of the industry. We certainly know what they’re trying to pay 
for  crude  oil.  But  some  of  those  softer  issues,  in  terms  of  propri-
etary  data  within  the  industry—what  it  costs  to  market,  what  is 
their profit margins—those are little tougher to come by. 

Senator  PRYOR.  The  reason  I  ask  is  because  there  is  a  story  in 
today’s press that talked about how there are eight Governors that 
are asking the Congress, and the White House, to do an investiga-
tion of price-gouging and try to give some relief out there, and they 
have a study—I may be wrong, but I believe it’s out of the Univer-
sity  of  Wisconsin—an  economist  there  has  done  a  study,  and  he 
says that 85 to 90 cents of each gallon is for refining, distribution, 
and  taxes.  And  then  he  says  that  in  order  for  gas  at  the  pump  to 
get to $3 per gallon, the price per barrel would have to be $95 per 
barrel.  Are  you  aware  of  his  findings?  And  do  you  have  any 
thought on that? 

Mr. WELLS. I have not had an opportunity to see that particular 
study.  My  staff  has  pointed  out  that  they  heard  about  it.  We  will 
take a look at it. I will point out that that’s one of the things that 
we’re  beginning  to  gather  statistics  on,  is,  why  the  spread  is  in-
creasing  between  what  traditionally  had  been  a  fairly  consistent 
margin between what it—what the crude oil costs versus the retail 
price—and that spread seems to be doubling or tripling today—and 
asking  questions,  ‘‘Why  is  that,’’  and,  ‘‘What’s—why  is  it  occur-
ring? ’’—similar to what that study found. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Right.  And  let  me  ask,  of  the  FTC,  if  I  can,  is 
it  your  view  that,  given  the  American  oil  market  today—and  I 
know we’re part of a global market, and I understand that, but I’m 
talking  about  in  America  and  what  we  pay  for  petroleum  products 
here  today—is  it  your  view  that  the  FTC  has  the  tools  necessary 
to keep this market free and working like it should? 

Mr. SEESEL. Senator, I think that the Federal Trade Commission 
does have those tools. The primary tools, as you know, are the anti-
trust  laws  that  we  enforce  against  collusive  and  coordinated  con-
duct and against monopolistic behavior, such as in the Unocal case 
that  I  mentioned.  And  I  think  those  are  the—our  experience  has 
been, those are the kinds of practices that are really, over the long 
run,  likely  to  end  up  in  market  power  in  the  hands  of  firms  and 
pernicious effects for consumers. So, I think the full panoply of the 
antitrust  laws  that  we  enforce,  as  well  as  the  consumer-protection 
work that we do, is actually sufficient to deal with these problems. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

that—— 

Senator INOUYE. Thank you. 
Senator Nelson? 
Senator BEN NELSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr.  Seesel,  it  would  appear,  from  your  concern  about  collusion, 
that  it  relates  more  to  mergers  than  to  market  manipulation.  I 
don’t  think  that’s  a  fair  assessment  on  my  part,  but  if  you’re  wor-
ried  about  the  Unocal  acquisition,  that  they  would  then  have  con-
trol  over  some  products  or  some  technologies.  But  could  there  be 
collusion  in  the  markets  today,  apart  from,  let’s  say,  market  con-
centration because of mergers or acquisitions? 

Mr.  SEESEL.  Oh,  certainly,  Senator.  And  I  didn’t  want  to  imply 

Senator BEN NELSON. No, that’s why I said it—— 
Mr. SEESEL.—mergers are—— 
Senator BEN NELSON.—the way I said it. 
Mr.  SEESEL.  And,  for  example,  when  I  mentioned  the  gasoline 
and  diesel  price-monitoring  project  that  we  conducted  in  those  360 
cities around the country, that is really intended to find out wheth-
er  there  is  collusive  or  coordinated  behavior  going  on,  on  a  day-to- 
day  basis.  If  we  see  prices  in  a  particular  area  starting  to  get  out 
of  line  with  their  historical  relationship  with  prices  in  the  rest  of 
the country, that’s something that we want to look at more closely. 
And,  as  I  said,  we  might  find  an  innocuous  explanation  for  that, 
in terms of a pipeline or refinery problem. But we also, if we don’t 
find  an  innocuous  explanation,  it’s  something  we  do  want  to  look 
at, and that would, perhaps, imply collusive behavior. 

Senator  BEN NELSON.  Could  you  give  me  an  example  of  what 

would be collusive behavior? 

Mr.  SEESEL.  I  think  agreements  among  competitors,  whether 
they  take  the  form  of  express  agreement  or  some  kind  of  implicit 
understanding  among  competitors,  to  restrict  supply,  to  set  prices 
at a particular level—— 

Senator  BEN NELSON.  Well,  if  you  go  down  the  list—go  down  a 
major thoroughfare, and you take a look, and the prices are all the 
same  through  all  the  competitors,  could  that  constitute  collusion? 
Where’s  the  competition  there?  Wouldn’t  you  think  there  would  be 
some  adjustment  from  station  A  to  B  to  C  to  D?  They’re  all  the 
same. 

Mr.  SEESEL.  Well,  Senator,  certainly  in  my  experience  I’ve  seen 
markets similar to what you’re describing. And I’ve also seen mar-
kets where there’s actually a difference of quite a bit. For example, 
there are low price retailers that are selling the gasoline for a nick-
el  or  a  dime  lower  than  traditional  stations.  But,  even  if  you  saw 
absolute,  total  uniformity,  it  would  certainly  be  enough  to  raise 
your eyebrows and my eyebrows, but it also might imply that, sim-
ply,  the  companies  are  coalescing  around  a  particular  price.  They 
might have similar input costs and so forth. And they look at each 
other  and  say,  ‘‘Yes,  that  looks  like  a  fairly  reasonable  price.’’  I 
think  you  could  see  that  phenomenon  without  necessarily  being 
able to infer some kind of agreement. 

Senator BEN NELSON. And I think it’s safe to say that the poten-
tial for collusion is less likely with the local station operators back 
in the States, or with the suppliers to them directly, the wholesaler 
there,  then  somewhere  after—pre-wholesaler,  pre-retailer.  And

that’s  why  I  think,  for  example,  in  Nebraska,  the  Nebraska  Attor-
ney  General  said,  after  his  investigation,  he  didn’t  find  any  collu-
sion. So, that leaves us with something pre-. And I’m hopeful that’s 
what your investigation will look into. Do you have any idea of how 
long we might be waiting until we get some sort of an investigation 
report? 

Mr.  SEESEL.  Well,  certainly,  Senator,  the  investigation  under 
Section  1809  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act  is  something  we’re—we’ve 
got our staff of economists and lawyers working on that right now, 
and  trying  to  go  as  quickly  as  they  can.  We’re  going  to  try  to 
produce a report for the Congress as quickly as we can. 

Senator BEN NELSON. Well, I’m not a very patient person, I only 

require the appearance of it. I’m not patient. 

Mr. SEESEL. We certainly won’t—— 
Senator BEN NELSON. So, Senator Pryor and I have worked, and 
we’ve gotten the support for a quicker study than that, one that is 
perhaps  not  as  exhaustive  or  thorough,  but  would  give  an  imme-
diate  answer  to  what’s  going  on  with  supply-and-demand,  as  well 
as  some  idea  of  what  might  happen  in  the  future.  Obviously,  not 
totally thorough. And we hope that that will survive the legislation 
that it’s part of right now, and that that will come to you, because 
it’s going to ask you to give us answers in 15 days. Because Grand-
ma  Milly,  this—going  in  into  this  fall,  needs  to  know  whether  her 
heating  expenses  are  going  to  go  up  30  percent,  40  percent—she 
has to have some idea of what’s going to happen. 

Finally,  I  want  to  ask  you,  is  your—are  you  planning  to  do  any-
thing as an inquiry on natural gas, apart from what the energy bill 
would require? 

Mr.  SEESEL.  Well,  certainly,  Senator,  obviously,  the  focus  of  the 
whole  country  and  the  Commission  in  recent  weeks  has  been  on 
the  gasoline  market,  but  we’re  aware  that  natural  gas  is  going  to 
be  a  critical  issue,  and  a  big  issue  over  the  winter  in  this  country. 
And  certainly  if  competition  issues  arise  in  the  natural  gas  indus-
try, the FTC will treat those with equal energy, so to speak, so that 
we  will  look  at  any  kind  of  antitrust  issue  that  arises  in  natural 
gas. 

Senator  BEN NELSON.  Will  you  be—or  will  the  GAO—be  making 
any kind of an inquiry into the potential disparity between market 
prices  driven  by  speculation?  Is  there  a  way  to  put  a  safety  valve 
on  spikes  in  the  market  at  any  one  particular  day,  either  signifi-
cant  drops  or  significant  spikes  that  could  otherwise  drive  the 
price, as it seems to have driven in the past? 

Mr.  WELLS.  Senator,  we’re  clearly  aware  that  there’s  no  current 
Federal  statute  or  law  prohibiting  price-gouging.  We  know  that 
about  half  the  states  do  have  some  type  of  legislative  provisions. 
But we—— 

Senator  BEN NELSON.  But  they  can’t  get  to  the—they  can’t  get 

to the level of inquiry that you can. 

Mr. WELLS. Absolutely. And we work for you. You guys, you send 
a  request  and  we  certainly  try  to  look  into  it  and  figure  out  what 
we can do. 

Senator BEN NELSON. Well, then I’ll be sending an inquiry. 
Mr. WELLS. We’d be glad to help you. 
Senator BEN NELSON. OK.

95 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator INOUYE. Thank you very much. 
This morning, we’ve heard the words ‘‘global market,’’ ‘‘global in-
dustry,’’  ‘‘global  economy.’’  About  5  years  ago,  I  was  a  member  of 
a  Congressional  delegation,  and  we  were  in  Italy.  At  that  time,  if 
my  recollection  is  correct,  I  noted  that  the  dollar  equivalent  for  a 
gallon  of  gas  in  Italy  was  about  $1.50.  At  the  same  time  here  it 
was about—no, no—here, it was $1.50 but there it was about $3.50 
a gallon. Today, without Katrina in Italy, I have been told that the 
price  of  gasoline  exceeds  $7  a  gallon.  Now,  this  is  all  part  of  the 
global  industry  and  global  economy.  Why  this  difference?  I  notice 
they have smaller cars, for one thing, fuel-efficient cars. 

Mr. WELLS. At $7 a gallon, perhaps more people would be driving 
fuel-efficient  cars,  there’s  no  question.  Primarily,  throughout  the 
entire  world,  everybody  is  paying  80  percent  more  for  the  cost  of 
crude  oil  today  than  they  were  15  months  ago.  It’s  not  just  a  U.S. 
issue; it is a world issue. Primarily, as I understand it, the big dif-
ference is tax policies generated by the countries. For instance, our 
average tax in the United States is 44 cents a gallon, consisting of 
about  18  cents  Federal,  20-some  cents  State.  Canada  is  $1.  U.K., 
for instance, is $4. Gasoline outside the United States is taxed very 
heavily compared to our tax structure. 

Senator INOUYE. So, we have very cheap gas. 
Mr. WELLS. That is correct. We have built an economy and a life-
style that has grown accustomed to cheap energy. And the question 
is—‘‘Can we have cheap energy for our children?’’ is a big question 
mark. 

Senator  INOUYE.  Do  you  believe  that  this  cheap  gas  should  be 

made a bit more expensive, as a disincentive—— 

Mr.  WELLS.  I  believe  we  have  to  make  wise  choices,  and  we  have  to  go  and  get 
energy  wherever  we  can  get  it.  And  we  need  to  work  on  both  sides,  supply  and  re-
duction  of  demand—is  the  only  way  we’ll  be  able  to  achieve  getting  the  quantity  of 
energy  that  we’re  just  going  to  need  to  maintain  our  same  standard  of  living  that 
we’re accustomed to today. 

Senator  INOUYE.  When  you  speak  of  ‘‘seeking  energy  anywhere 

you can,’’ are you speaking of drilling elsewhere? 

Mr.  WELLS.  I  was  speaking  of—we  have  a  policy  and  practice  in 
place  that  has  focused  on—80  percent  of  our  energy  delivery  is 
coming  to  us  from  the  fossil  arena.  My  belief  is  that  that  will  not 
be  able  to  provide  the  quantity  we’re  going  to  need  in  the  next  20 
years.  I’m  speaking  to  going  out  and  looking  for  renewables—wind 
energy, nuclear. It’s looking at wherever you may go to find energy 
sources that will meet this—pick an energy source, Mr. Chairman. 
Any  energy  source  is  projected  to  have  a  demand  20  to  50  percent 
greater  than  what  we’re  currently  using  today.  Those  are  huge 
numbers.  Somewhere,  that  has  got  to  be  provided.  And  I  believe 
we’re going to have to go everywhere to look for it. 

Senator  INOUYE.  Should  we  provide  changes  in  the  law  that 

would bring about some incentive for this movement? 

Mr. WELLS. Clearly, we have a policy/practice in place to use our 
tax  incentives  with  tax  credits  to  promote  and  foster  the  develop-
ment, R&D, but we need to do everything. We need tax incentives, 
we  need  modernization  of  equipment,  we  need  a  partnership  with 
the Federal, as well as the private sector, which delivers these com-

modities. We need everybody working together and pulling together 
to find that quantity of energy we’re going to need. 

Senator INOUYE. Mr. Seesel? 
Mr.  SEESEL.  Mr.  Chairman,  some  of  these  questions,  obviously, 
are outside the purview of what the FTC does, but I certainly agree 
with  Mr.  Wells  that  the  Nation  needs  to  focus  on—very  seriously 
on both the supply and the demand sides of the equation. Speaking 
just  for  myself,  I  think  that  that  is—it’s  important,  really,  to  find 
solutions on both sides of the problem. 

Senator  INOUYE.  Mr.  Seesel,  this  is  a  question  for  you.  On  Sep-
tember 9, the mid-Atlantic AAA issued a press release—I’m certain 
you’ve seen that—in which they cited the clamor among the Exxon/ 
Chevron dealers complaining about the high prices—these are deal-
ers  complaining—in  which  they’ve  cited  that,  in  a  24-hour  period, 
the price of gas went up 24 cents. Did that cause you any concern? 
Mr.  SEESEL.  Mr.  Chairman,  it’s  certainly  something  that  we  are 
aware  of.  I  don’t  know  if  I’ve  seen  that  specific  AAA  release,  but 
we’re—we  certainly  got  a  lot  of  information,  beyond  that,  about 
large  increases,  within  a  day  or  2  days,  of  20—you  know,  20–30- 
cent  range,  even  more,  in  the  wake  of  Katrina.  I  don’t—generally, 
I  mean,  we’ve  been  looking  at  those  data  very  carefully  since  the 
hurricane  and  trying  to  ascertain  what’s  going  on.  My  sense  is,  as 
I  testified  a  couple  of  weeks  ago  in  the  House,  is  that,  to  a  great 
extent,  there  was  a  fairly  panicked  reaction  going  on,  on  the  part 
of both sellers and buyers of a commodity that was getting scarcer 
and scarcer; with all of the refineries and pipelines shut down. So, 
that kind of spike is certainly something that deserves scrutiny. It 
is  not  automatically  suspicious,  on  its  face,  but  it  certainly  needs 
a careful look. 

Senator  INOUYE.  Was  there  any  economic  justification  or  ration-

ale for $6 a gallon gas in Atlanta? 

Mr. SEESEL. Mr. Chairman, I don’t know if it’s really possible to 
speak,  in  economic  terms,  about  that.  My  understanding,  from 
reading about what that particular dealer did—and I believe it was 
an  isolated  retailer  in  Atlanta—was  that  he  was  very  concerned 
about  having  any  supply  the  following  day,  given  what  was  going 
on  with  the  Colonial  and  Plantation  Pipelines.  And  so,  he  decided, 
‘‘The only way I’m going to have supply tomorrow and the next day 
is  to  ration  demand,  and  the  only  way  I’m  going  to  do  that  is  by 
putting  my  price  at  a  very  high  level.’’  I’m  not—I’m  certainly  not 
speaking of justification of that, but I think that was an individual 
retailer  who  actually  said,  in  the  papers  after  that  happened,  that 
he had really panicked. And his—I think his wholesaler had raised 
prices  quite  a  bit,  also,  so  he  raised  his  own  retail  price.  But  I 
think,  to  a  great  extent,  it  was  an  almost  irrational  reaction  to 
what  was  going  on.  It’s  very  hard  to  analyze  it  in  economic  terms. 
Mr. WELLS. Mr. Chairman, could I add that I was in Alaska the 
week  after  the  hurricane.  Chairman  of  the  States,  and  I,  too,  with 
Senator  Pryor,  asking  the  question  relating  to:  Why  were  prices 
going  up  all  over  the  country  that  were  not  directly  related  to 
Katrina?  There  was  a  gas  station  that  we  filled  up  in,  in  Valdez, 
Alaska,  on  the  morning  in  which  the  USA  Today  newspaper  pic-
ture  appeared  on  the  front  page.  I  asked  the  person  pumping  the 
gas  into  the  rental  car,  ‘‘Why  did  your  price  go  up  $2  overnight?’’

97 

And  he  pointed  to  the  picture  on  the  USA  Today  and  said,  ‘‘This 
is  why  I  raised  my  price.’’  It  had  nothing  to  do  with  what  he 
thought  the  price  of  gas  may  be;  it  was  an  opportunity  for  him. 
That’s  an  anecdotal  one  incident,  but  it  happened  throughout  the 
country,  had  no  bearing,  necessarily,  on  shortage  of  supply;  it  was 
a fear-risk-premium decision by owners. 

Senator  INOUYE.  If  that’s  the  case,  there’s  a  hurricane  called 
Rita, Category 4, headed toward Texas. And I suppose it’s going to 
affect  the  global  oil  industry.  Are  we  to  anticipate  further  hikes? 
Mr.  WELLS.  We  saw  $4—as  soon  as  Hurricane  Rita  turned  the 
corner on the Florida Keys, it went to $4. First, you’ll see the reac-
tion  in  the  futures  market.  You’ll  see  the  speculators  getting  in-
volved  in  looking  at  the  volatility  and  price  movement,  because 
that’s  where  they  make  the  money.  I’m  not  necessarily  sure  that 
that’s  where  you’re  going  to  get  your  pegging  of  what  the  price  of 
gasoline is going to be, because that will calm as we get more infor-
mation about what damage the hurricane may or may not do to our 
facilities  there  in  the  Gulf.  And  it  may  settle  back.  But  there  is  a 
high  risk  of  having  a  major  impact  on  the  marketplace,  no  ques-
tion. 

Senator INOUYE. You mean we—— 
Mr. WELLS. We should be—— 
Senator INOUYE.—could see five, six dollars a gallon? 
Mr.  WELLS.  I  would  be  unwise  to  try  to  predict.  That’s  why  I 

would not deal in the futures market. 

Senator  INOUYE.  I  thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Wells,  Mr.  Seesel. 

You’ve been very patient, very helpful. 
Do you have any further questions? 
Senator PRYOR. Mr. Chairman, I really just wanted to say a cou-
ple  of  things  as  we  wrap  up  here,  and  that  is  that,  for  the  FTC’s 
benefit, I share what—the concern that Senator Nelson had, where 
I’m  not  sure  collusion  is  the  right  standard.  I  think  that  the  fact 
that—I  think  you  need  to  be  looking  more  at  market-power  con-
cepts. And the fact that there’s just low elasticity of demand for oil 
in this country. I mean, if gas goes up, we’re still all going to have 
to  drive  to  work,  and  that’s  just—we’re  just  dependent  on  it.  So,  I 
would think that we—just, the FTC needs to consider that. And I’m 
sure you probably do. 

But the other couple of anecdotal stories—and since we’re talking 
about  anecdotes,  is—one  is,  I  heard  a  story—I  heard—talked  to  a 
man the other day who is a gas-station owner, and, right after the 
hurricane,  he  got  a  call  from  his  distributor,  and  he  said—and  the 
distributor said, ‘‘Look,’’ he said, ‘‘you’re going to get only a limited 
amount  of  gasoline.  I  only  have  X  number  of  trucks  available.  So, 
you  know,  typically,  you  get  four  trucks.’’  And  he  said,  ‘‘I’m  not’’— 
over a certain period of time—he said, ‘‘I cannot tell you right now 
what  the  price  is,  but  you’ve  got  to  take  it  or  leave  it  right  now.’’ 
So,  he  just  had  to  agree  to  some  open-ended  blank  check  without 
having  any  idea  what  he  was  going  to  be  charged  for  that,  and 
what he was going to have to charge his customers for that. 

So,  I  think  a  lot  of  that  happened.  Again,  I  think  some  of  that 
is  based  on  fear,  some  of  it  is  based  on  speculation,  or  whatever 
the case may be. But I think some of it is not really based on sound 
market  principles.  And  this  particular  gas-station  owner  had  no-

where  else  to  go.  He  didn’t  have  another  option,  or  at  least  he 
didn’t have many other options. Maybe he had another one, I don’t 
know.  But  he  felt  like  he  didn’t  have  any  options,  under  the  cir-
cumstances.  He  felt  like  he  needed  to  take  that.  And,  of  course, 
whatever the price was, he just had to pass it on to his customers. 
The  other  thing  is,  on  9/11,  I  was  the  Attorney  General  in  my 
state,  and  we  saw  some  immediate  price  hikes,  just  like  in  Arkan-
sas  after  Hurricane  Katrina.  We  had  some  complaints  around  the 
state  that  a  few  gas  stations—we  know  of  a  few  that  raised  their 
prices  as  much  as  60  cents  a  gallon  in  one  day,  based  on  fear  and 
all this in the marketplace. But we have a price-gouging law in our 
state.  And  so,  as  Attorney  General—you  know,  the  emergency  had 
been declared, and that—and so, we were able to invoke the price- 
gouging statute. And we feel like we kept the market stable in Ar-
kansas  in  9/11.  That  was  a  very  scary  day  in  American  history,  in 
the  aftermath.  There  was  a  lot  of  uncertainty.  But  we  felt  like  we 
helped keep the gasoline market stable in our State. 

And  I  noticed,  in  USA  Today,  one  thing  that  was  interesting  is, 
they  recently  ran  a  map  of  the  prices  from  September  3  through 
5, so just a few days after the hurricane, Mr. Chairman. In looking 
at  the  map,  one  thing  I  noticed,  that  comes  through  crystal  clear, 
is, down in that Gulf Coast area, the area that was hit by the hur-
ricane,  they  had  the  lowest  prices  for  gasoline  in  the  country.  And 
one  reason  I  think  that  may  be  true  is,  in  Louisiana  and  Mis-
sissippi, they have price-gouging laws, and their local leaders there 
got the word out that they were not going to tolerate price-gouging. 
And  I  think  that  probably  helped  keep  the  markets  there  at  the 
market level and not have this crazy fluctuation in it. 

So,  those  are  just  thoughts.  Personally,  I  think  we  probably 
ought to give strong consideration to a Federal price-gouging stand-
ard. But, you know, we’re not going to resolve that today. But I do 
think we ought to give that strong consideration. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator INOUYE. Once again, thank you very much. 
The  Committee  will  stand  in  recess  until  2  o’clock  this  after-

noon—2:30, I’m sorry. 

[Whereupon, at 12:45 p.m., the hearing was recessed.]

ENERGY  PRICING—AFTERNOON  SESSION 

WEDNESDAY,  SEPTEMBER  21,  2005 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  2:30  p.m.  in  room 
SD–562,  Dirksen  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Ted  Stevens, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

The  CHAIRMAN.  This  is  the  second  hearing  the  Committee  has 
conducted  today  to  address  the  issues  of  energy  prices.  This  morn-
ing,  we  heard  from  private-sector  energy  experts,  as  well  as  the 
Federal  Government,  all  of  whom  provided  valuable  testimony  re-
garding  the  multiple  factors  that  contribute  to  energy  prices.  Dur-
ing  this  session,  we’ll  hear  from  witnesses  from  the  oil  production 
and refinery industry, consumer and trade groups, and the Federal 
Government. 

Senator Inouye, and I, thank the witnesses for being here and for 
agreeing  to  join  us  on  such  short  notice.  As  I  indicated  this  morn-
ing,  these  hearings  are  designed  to  examine  the  short-  and  long- 
term rise in domestic energy prices and will explore whether price- 
gouging is occurring, or whether the market is controlling prices in 
response to an abnormal market circumstance. 

Senator Inouye, do you have a statement this afternoon? 
Senator INOUYE. No. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Our  first  witness  this  afternoon  will  be  Senator 
Wyden.  We’re  pleased  to  listen  to  you.  We’re  going  to  limit  wit-
nesses to 5 minutes this afternoon, Senator, because we want to try 
to get to that briefing at 4 o’clock, if that’s all possible. 

Senator WYDEN. Mr. Chairman, I—— 
The CHAIRMAN. We’ll call the two panels at the same time. 
We’d  like  to  have  you  join  us  at  the  table,  if  you  wish,  after  you 

testify. 

STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON 

Senator  WYDEN.  Thank  you  for  your  thoughtfulness,  Mr.  Chair-
man. I very much appreciate you, and the Ranking Minority Mem-
ber having me. I know you’ve had a long day already. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I’ve  been  cranking  out  investigative  reports  on 
this  issue  now  since  I’ve  come  to  the  Senate,  and  I’ve  come  to  the 
conclusion  that  there  is  a  need  to  strengthen  consumer  protection

law  in  this  area.  But,  this  is  not  primarily  a  question  of  strength-
ening  the  law,  it’s  a  question  of  political  will.  And  you  can  write 
laws  by  the  crateful,  and  that’s  not  going  to  protect  the  consumer 
if the consumer watchdog remains far from the beat. And that’s the 
situation we’re in today. 

And I want to start by saying, that it seems to me, that the Fed-
eral Trade Commission can get results for the consumer when they 
sincerely  want  to.  And  we  saw  that  specifically  with  the  Do  Not 
Call  Program.  Like  on  this  gas-pricing  situation,  we  had  a  chal-
lenge where the marketplace wasn’t working, we go to Alaska, Ha-
waii,  and  Oregon,  people  would  say,  ‘‘Stand  up  for  us.’’  The  Con-
gress  responded.  The  Congress  passed  a  law.  It  had  teeth.  It 
worked. And it has made a real difference. 

So,  in  my  view,  what  Congress  needs  to  do  is,  in  effect,  give  the 
Federal  Trade  Commission  the  authority  to  run  the  equivalent  of 
a  Do  Not  Gouge  Program  and  require,  in  effect,  that  the  Federal 
Trade Commission stiffen its backbone and exhibit the political will 
to act. 

Here  are  the  four  areas  that  I  think  would  constitute  what 
amounts  to  an  energy  approach  that  would  be  like  ‘‘Do  Not  Call.’’ 
I  call  it  ‘‘Do  Not  Gouge,’’  but  I  think  the  point  is,  it  would  be  an 
energy  equivalent  to  something  that  has  made  the  Federal  Trade 
Commission actually produce some results. 

The first is, give the Federal Trade Commission authority so they 
can  no  longer  say  their  hands  are  tied  by  the  law.  This  morning, 
the Federal Trade Commission testified that, under Section 1809 of 
the  Energy  bill,  they’re  investigating  gas  prices  for  possible  anti-
trust violations. That’s not the same thing as saying they’re inves-
tigating for price-gouging. Price gouging without collusion isn’t cov-
ered  by  the  antitrust  laws.  So,  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  has 
already  said  they  can’t  do  anything  about  price-gouging  by  indi-
vidual companies. So, the Federal Trade Commission is now inves-
tigating  for  something  they  can’t  find—collusion—because  the  oil 
companies  don’t  need  to  collude  to  price  gouge,  and  the  Federal 
Trade  Commission  can’t  do  anything  about  price-gouging  by  indi-
vidual companies that they find. So, by their own admission, there 
is  a  clear  gap  in  the  agency’s  authority  to  protect  the  consumers. 
The  agency—the  GAO  also  testified  that  there’s  no  Federal  law 
prohibiting  price-gouging.  So,  these  are  areas  where  the  Federal 
Trade  Commission  doesn’t  have  the  tools  that  it  needs.  Congress 
ought  to  change  the  law,  give  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  ex-
plicit authority to go after gougers wherever it’s taking place. 

Second, I would hope that we’d find the facts. Congress could re-
quire that when a large individual seller of gas raises prices signifi-
cantly  faster  than  the  price  of  crude,  the  Federal  Trade  Commis-
sion  would  obtain  from  the  seller  documentation  that  the  differen-
tial is warranted in the marketplace. 

We  went  to  the  Congressional  Research  Service,  I  would  tell  my 
respected  colleagues,  and  got  information  that  has  produced  stun-
ning  results  that  are  on  this  chart.  In  all  the  time  for  which  the 
data is available, there has never been the price disparity between 
increases in the price of gas and increase in the price of crude that 
we have seen in the last year. We found that over the last 30 years, 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  15:23 May 10, 2011 Jkt 066218 PO 00000 Frm 00104 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\66218.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

101 

when  crude  oil  prices  went  up,  annual  gasoline  prices  often  didn’t 
even keep pace. 

This  chart  shows  the  difference  with  this  particular  time  period. 
Before  Hurricane  Katrina,  gas  prices—increases  were  36  percent 
bigger than crude oil increases. The number ballooned to a shame-
ful  68  percent  immediately  after  the  storm.  Those  kinds  of  num-
bers,  based  on  what  we  have  gotten  from  the  Congressional  Re-
search  Service,  the  Energy  Information  Agency,  and  others,  have 
never existed in our history. 

I  would  ask,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  a  copy  of  this  chart  be  placed 
in  the  record.  And  I’d  like  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  to  ask 
the oil companies to explain a chart like this that is unprecedented.

Senator  WYDEN.  Third,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  see  the 
Federal  Trade  Commission  ‘‘out’’  the  price  gougers.  If  a  huge  dif-
ferential  between  crude  price  spikes  and  gasoline  prices  can’t  be 
justified  by  the  marketplace,  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  ought 
to  put  suspicious  sellers,  at  least  the  top  100,  on  a  ‘‘Do  Not  Gouge 
List’’  that  puts  them  on  notice  and  lets  consumers  know  whose 
prices are cause for concern. 

Fourth,  Mr.  Chairman,  the  agency  ought  to  go  after  the  proven 
bad  actors.  If  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  finds  that  gas  prices 
go beyond disparity with crude to a level that is simply unconscion-
able,  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  ought  to  have  the  power  and 
the  responsibility  to  order  the  price  gouger  to  stop  and  to  fine  the 
gouger. 

Finally, Mr. Chairman, two other recommendations that I would 
make,  one  that  I  think  the  Committee  might  find  a  little  sur-
prising, coming from me. 

I  would  like  to  see  Congress  look  at  allowing  the  oil  companies 
to coordinate when they schedule their refinery maintenance, so as 
to avoid supply shortages from multiple refineries in an area shut-
ting  down  at  the  same  time.  This  usually  happens  every  Spring, 
when  multiple  refineries  shut  down  for  maintenance  before  they 
gear  up  to  produce  gas  for  the  Summer  driving  season.  To  avoid 
supply  disruptions  and  price  spikes  for  consumers,  I  think  we 
ought  to  look  at  a  limited  antitrust  exemption  to  allow  the  refin-
eries to coordinate the timing of their shutdowns as long as it was 
done to avoid or minimize disruption of fuel supplies. 

I see the red light is on, Mr. Chairman. I want to adhere to your 
schedule.  I  also  have  an  idea  with  respect  to  the  CAFE  issue,  to 
use  marketplace  forces  to  incentivize  more  fuel  efficiency.  But,  in 
the  interest  of  time,  and,  particularly  because  I’m  grateful  to  you 
and the Ranking Minority Member, let me break it off now and ask 
that my full remarks be put into the record. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Wyden follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN, U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON 

Mr. Chairman, thank you for providing me the opportunity to testify today. 
I’ve come to the conclusion that while there is a need to strengthen consumer pro-
tection  law  in  the  area  of  energy  pricing,  specifically  gasoline,  this  is  as  much  a 
question of political will at the Federal Trade Commission as it is a question of Con-
gress  passing  new  laws.  All  the  laws  in  the  world  aren’t  going  to  protect  the  con-
sumer if the consumer watchdog remains far from its beat. 

Last  year,  I  issued  a  report  on  the  FTC’s  Campaign  of  Inaction  that  documented 
how  the  agency  has  failed  to  act  to  protect  gasoline  consumers.  My  report  docu-
mented how the FTC has refused to challenge oil industry mergers that the Govern-
ment  Accountability  Office  says  have  raised  gas  prices  at  the  pump  by  7  cents  a 
gallon  on  the  West  Coast.  My  report  also  documented  how  the  FTC  failed  to  act 
when  refineries  have  been  shut  down  or  stop  anti-competitive  practices  like  red-
lining and zone pricing. That report and others are available on my website. 

The  FTC  has  shown  they  can  get  results  when  they  want  to—when  there  is  the 
political  will.  Witness  the  ‘‘Do  Not  Call’’  program.  Just  as  today,  consumers  saw 
there  was  a  problem  in  the  marketplace;  they  said  to  their  government,  ‘‘Stand  up 
for  us.’’  In  that  case,  the  Congress,  despite  judicial  opposition,  gave  the  Federal 
Trade  Commission  the  authority  to  run  a  Do  Not  Call  program.  It’s  made  a  real 
difference. 

In  this  case,  Congress  needs  to  move  to  give  the  agency  the  authority  to  run  the 
equivalent  of  a  ‘‘Do  Not  Gouge’’  program—and  require  in  those  laws  that  the  FTC 
stiffen its backbone and exhibit the political will to act. 

Here are ways to jumpstart the ‘‘Do Not Gouge’’ effort: 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  15:23 May 10, 2011 Jkt 066218 PO 00000 Frm 00106 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\66218.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

103 

One—Give  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  sufficient  authority  so  they  can  no 
longer  say  their  hands  are  tied  by  the  law.  The  FTC  testified  this  morning  that 
under section 1809 of the Energy Bill, they are investigating gas prices for possible 
antitrust violations. But that’s not the same thing as investigating for price-gouging. 
Price gouging without collusion isn’t covered by the antitrust laws. The FTC has ad-
mitted  in  testimony  in  the  House  that  they  can’t  do  anything  about  price-gouging 
by individual companies. So the FTC is investigating for something they can’t find— 
collusion—because  the  oil  companies  don’t  need  to  collude  to  price  gouge,  and  the 
FTC  can’t  do  anything  about  price-gouging  by  individual  companies  that  they  find. 
By their own admission, there is a clear gap in the agency’s authority to protect con-
sumers at the pump. The GAO also testified today that there is no Federal law pro-
hibiting  price-gouging.  So  these  are  clearly  areas  where  the  FTC  doesn’t  have  all 
the tools it needs. Congress should change the law and give FTC the explicit author-
ity to go after anyone who is exploiting consumers. I don’t care who the gouger is— 
whether  it’s  an  oil  company,  a  refiner,  or  an  individual  station.  I  want  the  FTC  to 
find out and crack down. 

Two—Get  the  facts.  I  believe  Congress  should  require  that  when  a  large  indi-
vidual seller of gasoline raises prices significantly faster than the price of crude in-
creases,  the  FTC  must  obtain  from  that  seller  documentation  that  the  differential 
is warranted in the marketplace. The media has documented that over the last year 
gasoline  prices  have  increased  much  faster  than  the  price  of  crude.  But  my  office 
went  further.  We  took  data  from  the  Energy  Information  Administration,  verified 
it  with  the  Congressional  Research  Service,  and  we  have  compiled  some  stunning 
results  on  this  chart.  In  all  the  time  for  which  data  is  available,  there  has  never 
been  the  kind  of  disparity  between  increases  in  the  price  of  gasoline  and  the  in-
crease in the price of crude oil that we’ve seen in the last year. We found that dur-
ing the last 30 years, when crude oil prices went up, annual gasoline price increases 
often  didn’t  even  keep  pace.  This  chart  shows  what  the  media  found  and  what  we 
found.  Before  Hurricane  Katrina,  gasoline  price  increases  were  36  percent  bigger 
than crude oil increases. That number ballooned to a shameful 68 percent disparity 
immediately after the storm. And those kinds of numbers just don’t exist in the pre-
vious  30  years.  I  ask  that  a  copy  of  this  chart  be  placed  in  the  record.  I’d  like  the 
FTC to ask the oil companies to explain that one. 

Three—Require the FTC, at a minimum, to ‘‘out the gougers.’’ If a huge differen-
tial between crude price spikes and gasoline prices can’t be justified by marketplace 
conditions,  the  FTC  should  put  suspicious  sellers—at  least  the  top  100—on  a  ‘‘Do 
Not  Gouge’’  list,  putting  them  on  notice  and  letting  consumers  know  whose  prices 
are cause for concern. 

Four—Go  after  the  proven  bad  actors.  If  the  FTC  finds  that  the  gasoline  prices 
go beyond disparity with crude to a level that is simply unconscionable, the Federal 
Trade  Commission  should  have  the  power—and  the  responsibility  in  law—to  order 
the price gouger to stop and to fine the gouger. 

In  addition  to  giving  the  FTC  new  enforcement  powers,  there  are  other  actions 
this Committee can take to help out gasoline consumers. One would allow oil compa-
nies  to  coordinate  when  they  schedule  their  refinery  maintenance  to  avoid  supply 
shortages from multiple refineries in an area shutting down at the same time. This 
usually  happens  each  Spring  when  multiple  refineries  shut  down  for  maintenance 
before  they  gear  up  to  produce  gasoline  for  the  Summer  driving  season.  To  avoid 
supply disruptions and price spikes for consumers, I propose a limited antitrust ex-
emption  to  allow  the  refineries  to  coordinate  the  timing  of  their  shutdowns  as  long 
as it was done to avoid or minimize disruption of fuel supplies. 

To provide relief for consumers at the pump over the long-term and to reduce our 
Nation’s  dependence  on  foreign  oil,  nothing  is  more  critical  than  improving  fuel 
economy  in  the  transportation  sector.  During  the  energy  bill  conference,  I  proposed 
a  very  modest  one  mile  per  gallon  increase  each  year  for  the  next  5  years  in  Cor-
porate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. My proposal is much more modest 
than  what  the  leading  scientific  experts  in  the  country  have  found  is  both  tech-
nically feasible and affordable to consumers. 

To make this proposal more attractive to carmakers, I would add a market incen-
tive to encourage companies to go beyond the minimum one-mile per year increase. 
For  example,  the  companies  that  have  the  largest  increase  in  fuel  economy  for  ei-
ther  their  passenger  cars  or  SUVs  and  light  trucks  could  get  double  or  even  triple 
credit for the amount they exceed the required increase. This bonus could count to-
ward the company’s future model year requirements to provide additional flexibility 
in meeting the new standards. 

In  closing,  I  again  urge  the  Committee  to  give  the  Federal  Trade  Commission 
more tools to protect consumers at the gas pump. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, 
the White House said there would be ‘‘zero tolerance for price-gouging.’’ But having

104 

a zero tolerance policy is meaningless unless there’s enforcement to back it up and, 
right now, the Federal Government can only take action against price-gouging when 
there’s  out  and  out  collusion.  There  needs  to  be  stronger  Federal  remedies  to  stop 
unconscionable price-gouging whenever and wherever it takes place. 

Thank you again for providing me the opportunity to testify before the Committee. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  We  will  put  your  full  statement  in  the  record, 
and  a  copy  of  that  chart.  We’re  pleased  to  have  your  comments. 
And  we’ll  look  into  that  possibility  of  a  partial  exemption.  I  don’t 
think  we  have  the  jurisdiction  to  do  that,  but  we  can  recommend 
it—jointly  recommend  it  to  the  Judiciary  Committee.  Thank  you 
very much, Senator. We appreciate—— 

Senator WYDEN. I’d settle for the ‘‘Do Not Gouge’’ effort here. 
Thank you both. 
The CHAIRMAN. We would like to call the panels, Robert Slaugh-
ter,  the  President  of  the  National  Petrochemical  &  Refiners  Asso-
ciation;  Tyson  Slocum,  the  Research  Director  of  the  Energy  Pro-
gram at the Public Citizen organization; Guy Caruso, the Adminis-
trator of the Energy Information Administration; and Ronald Kosh, 
Vice  President  of  Public  Policy  and  Government  Affairs  of  the 
American  Automobile  Association  of  the  Mid-Atlantic.  I’d  ask  you 
all to come up to the witness table. 

For  the  information  of  those  who  are  here,  the  Senate,  as  a 
whole,  has  been  called  to  a  briefing  by  the  Secretary  of  State  and 
the  Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  at  4  o’clock.  And  many  of  us 
think  that  is  extremely  important.  Senator  Inouye,  and  I,  manage 
the  Defense  Appropriations  bill,  and  we  will  be  marking  that  up 
next  Tuesday.  I  feel  it’s  necessary  for  us  to  be  there,  if  it’s  at  all 
possible. So, we will try to finish this in time. 

We do have an indication there are ten Senators that should join 
us during this period, and we’d be pleased if each of you would give 
us  an  oral  presentation  of  about  5  minutes.  And  we’ll  print  your 
statements that you presented to us in full in the record. And we’ll 
look forward to a period of question-and-answer by the Senators as 
they join us. 

So,  from  the  way  I  read  the  witnesses,  we’ll  proceed  with  Mr. 

Slaughter first. 

Do you have any opening here, Senator Inouye? 
Senator INOUYE. No. 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Slaughter? 

STATEMENT OF ROBERT G. SLAUGHTER, PRESIDENT, 

NATIONAL PETROCHEMICAL & REFINERS ASSOCIATION 

(NPRA) 

Mr. SLAUGHTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Sen-

ator Inouye and Senator Lautenberg. 

NPRA,  the  National  Petrochemical  &  Refiners  Association,  ap-
preciates your invitation to appear today. Our members include vir-
tually all U.S. refiners and petrochemical manufacturers. 

We  appreciate  the  level  of  concern  in  Congress,  and  among  your 
constituents, about the supply and price of refined petroleum prod-
ucts,  including  gasoline,  diesel,  jet  fuel,  and  heating  oil,  and  the 
fact  that  you  want  to  be  certain  that  markets  are  competitive  and 
that prices reflect market conditions.

The energy industry is vast, transparent, and highly competitive. 
You  heard  this  morning  from  the  Federal  Trade  Commission,  the 
pervasive  extent  of  scrutiny  that  is  applied  to  our  business  oper-
ations  because  of  the  importance  of  our  products  to  the  economic 
health of our Nation and the daily lives of Americans. 

You will hear, in just a minute, from the Energy Information Ad-
ministration,  the  extent  to  which  current  market  conditions  result 
from stiff competition for available supplies of crude oil worldwide, 
and the limited margin of spare crude supply capacity that is avail-
able.  All  this  has  resulted  in  high  prices  for  crude,  refiner’s  feed-
stock,  which  must  be  reflected  in  the  price  of  gasoline  and  the 
other products we sell. 

This  chart,  Senator,  shows  the  correlation  between  crude  prices 

and product prices. 

You  know,  also,  about  the  catastrophe  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  a 
direct hit upon the energy heartland of America, which affected the 
supply  of  crude  oil  and  products  and  natural  gas  to  much  of  the 
Nation. The storm affected 20 percent of U.S. refining capacity and 
5  percent  of  refining  capacity  is  still  out  of  service.  The  good  news 
is that substantial progress has been made in recovering from this 
crippling  blow.  But  much  remains  to  be  done.  But  Hurricane  Rita 
now threatens to deliver another attack on the Nation’s energy in-
frastructure. 

The market pricing system the Nation has relied on for so many 
years  is  helping  to  balance  supply-and-demand,  and  allocate  avail-
able  supplies  during  this  difficult  period.  There  have  been  allega-
tions  of  price-gouging  in  the  aftermath  of  Hurricane  Katrina. 
NPRA  and  its  membership  do  not  tolerate  price-gouging,  and  we 
recommend  that  any  allegations  of  price-gouging  be  thoroughly  in-
vestigated  and  that  prosecutions  move  forward  where  actual  and 
compelling evidence of this behavior is found. 

It is important, above all, however, that our Nation not lose faith 
in  the  market  pricing  system  that  so  efficiently  has  managed  to 
provide supplies of energy products at prices reflecting market con-
ditions  throughout  the  years.  This  is  not  the  time  to  return  to  the 
failed  policies  of  the  1970s,  with  government  intervention  that  re-
sulted  in  gasoline  lines  and  shortages.  U.S.  policy  must  restore  an 
emphasis  on  the  importance  of  adequate  energy  supplies  and  in-
vestment in our energy infrastructure. 

I  have,  in  front  of  me,  study  reports  done  at  several  times  over 
the past 10 years by the National Petroleum Council, a joint indus-
try  and  government  advisory  committee.  The  good  news  is  that 
these studies, which were requested by the Administration or Con-
gress during this period, recommended ways to increase fuel supply 
and  encourage  more  domestic  refining  capacity.  The  bad  news  is 
that  their  advice  was  never  implemented,  a  major  reason  why  we 
are  here  today  and  still  discussing  the  problems  that  face  us  after 
many years of neglect of energy supply concerns. 

One  of  their  paramount  recommendations  was  that  we  sequence 
environmental  projects  so  that  they  make  greater  sense  and  put 
less  strain  upon  capital  requirements  in  the  industry.  I’d  like  to 
show you a regulatory blizzard chart, which shows that the number 
of  environmental  programs  that  the  industry  is  complying  with, 
just in this time frame, cost roughly $20 billion total in this decade,

2000  to  2010.  And  I’ll  put  on  top  of  that—they’re  not  well 
sequenced, and they all hit at the same time, contrary to these rec-
ommendations.  I’d  like  to  show  you,  then,  out  of—after  the  recent 
Energy  bill,  these  are  the  requirements  that  the  refining  industry 
has to comply with, just in the next 2 years. All of these programs 
have  to  be  implemented  at  the  same  time  to  carry  forward  the  re-
quirements  that  we  already  face  from  environmental  regulations 
and those from the new bill. 

The  recently  passed  Energy  bill  asks  for  another  study  of  this 
type.  Will  it  be  treated  as  a  worthwhile  product  or  another  door-
stop?  Time  will  tell.  But  we’d  offer  our  advice.  We  urge  Congress 
to pay greater attention to the need for additional domestically-pro-
duced  energy  supplies  of  oil,  oil  products,  and  natural  gas,  and 
greater  attention  to  the  needs  of  our  energy  infrastructure,  by 
streamlining  permitting  requirements  to  allow  increased  refining 
capacity.  Energy  policy  should  at  least  eliminate  disincentives  to 
production of greater supplies of domestic energy, and allow the na-
tional  interest  in  greater  energy  supplies  to  take  its  rightful  place 
alongside environmental progress and other quality-of-life consider-
ations,  rather  than  pretend  that  those  considerations  are  not  inex-
tricably  linked,  as  they  are.  But,  unfortunately,  our  public  policy 
has not recognized those links for many years. 

I look forward to responding to your questions. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Slaughter follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT G. SLAUGHTER, PRESIDENT, 
NATIONAL PETROCHEMICAL & REFINERS ASSOCIATION (NPRA) 

Mr.  Chairman  and  members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to 
appear  today  to  discuss  the  multiple  factors  that  influence  the  price  of  energy  and 
related  issues.  My  name  is  Bob  Slaughter  and  I  am  President  of  NPRA,  the  Na-
tional  Petrochemical  &  Refiners  Association.  NPRA  is  a  national  trade  association 
with  450  members,  including  those  who  own  or  operate  virtually  all  U.S.  refining 
capacity,  and  most  U.S.  petrochemical  manufacturers.  My  comments  today  will  ad-
dress  the  supply  of  transportation  fuels,  chiefly  oil  and  oil  products;  I  will  also  dis-
cuss the importance of adequate supplies of natural gas. 
Introduction 

This hearing is intended to inquire into the factors affecting the gasoline market. 
The recent natural disaster resulting from Hurricane Katrina has had a significant 
impact on the Nation’s energy markets, and that subject will be discussed later. But 
it  is  important  to  remember  that  the  effect  of  Hurricane  Katrina  is  an  overlay  on 
a  pre-existing  condition.  That  was  and  is  a  situation  characterized  by  high  crude 
prices, strong demand for gasoline, diesel and other petroleum products, and a chal-
lenged energy infrastructure, especially in refining. NPRA is pleased to provide the 
Committee  the  following  discussion  of  these  conditions  and  NPRA’s  policy  rec-
ommendations for addressing them. We urge Members of the Committee to consider 
the  need  for  long  overdue—and  perhaps  even  bold—policy  changes  to  increase  the 
Nation’s supply of oil, oil products and natural gas as soon as possible. 

NPRA  supports  requirements  for  the  orderly  production  and  use  of  cleaner-burn-
ing  fuels  to  address  health  and  environmental  concerns,  while  at  the  same  time 
maintaining the flow of adequate and affordable gasoline and diesel supplies to the 
consuming  public.  Since  1970,  clean  fuels  and  clean  vehicles  have  accounted  for 
about 70 percent of all U.S. emission reductions from all sources, according to EPA. 
Over  the  past  10  years,  U.S.  refiners  have  invested  about  $47  billion  in  environ-
mental  improvements,  much  of  that  to  make  cleaner  fuels.  For  example,  according 
to EPA, the new Tier 2 low sulfur gasoline program, initiated in January 2004, will 
have  the  same  effect  as  removing  164  million  cars  from  the  road  when  fully  imple-
mented. 

Unfortunately,  however,  Federal  environmental  policies  have  often  neglected  to 
consider fully the impact of environmental regulations on fuel supply. Frankly, pol-
icymakers  have  often  taken  supply  for  granted,  except  in  times  of  obvious  market

instability.  This  attitude  must  end.  A  healthy  and  growing  U.S.  economy  requires 
a steady, secure, and predictable supply of petroleum products. 

There are no silver bullet solutions for balancing supply-and-demand. Indeed most 
of the problems in today’s gasoline market—without factoring in the market disrup-
tions caused by Katrina—result from the high price of crude oil due to economic re-
covery  abroad  together  with  strong  U.S.  demand  for  gasoline  and  diesel  due  to  the 
improving U.S. economy. 
Understanding  Gasoline  Market  Fundamentals:  High  Crude  Prices;  Strong 

Gasoline Demand Growth 

The overwhelming factor affecting gasoline and distillate prices is the supply and 
price of crude oil. In June of this year the U.S. Federal Trade Commission released 
a landmark study titled: ‘‘Gasoline Price Changes: The Dynamic of Supply, Demand 
and  Competition.’’  To  quote  from  the  FTC’s  findings:  ‘‘Worldwide  supply,  demand, 
and competition for crude oil are the most important factors in the national average 
price of gasoline in the U.S.’’ and ‘‘The world price of crude oil is the most important 
factor  in  the  price  of  gasoline.  Over  the  last  20  years,  changes  in  crude  oil  prices 
have explained 85 percent of the changes in the price of gasoline in the U.S.’’ 

Crude  prices  have  been  steadily  increasing  since  2004,  largely  because  of  sur-
prising  levels  of  growth  in  oil  demand  in  countries  such  as  China  and  India,  and 
in the United States as well. Actual demand growth for oil and oil products in these 
countries  in  2004  exceeded  the  experts’  predictions  and  has  remained  strong  this 
year. As a result, world demand for crude is bumping up against the worldwide abil-
ity to produce crude. 

Strong demand for crude has dissipated the cushion of excess available worldwide 
oil  supply,  just  as  strong  U.S.  demand  for  refined  products  has  eliminated  excess 
refining  capacity  in  the  United  States.  The  good  news  is  that  producing  countries 
will  probably  be  able  to  add  crude  production  capacity  in  the  years  to  come.  The 
bad  news  is  that  the  United  States  has  thus  far  shown  only  limited  willingness  to 
confront its own energy supply problems. 

As shown in Attachment 1, gasoline costs closely track the cost of crude oil. Before 
Hurricane Katrina, gasoline price increases lagged crude oil price increases on a gal-
lon  for  gallon  basis.  This  means  that  refiners  did  not  pass  through  all  of  the  in-
creased  costs  in  their  raw  material,  crude  oil.  Crude  oil  accounts  for  55–60  percent 
of  the  price  of  gasoline  seen  at  the  service  station.  The  cost  of  Federal  and  state 
taxes adds another 19 percent to the cost of a finished gallon of gasoline. Therefore 
under  current  conditions,  74–79  percent  of  the  total  cost  of  a  gallon  of  gasoline  is 
pre-determined before the crude is delivered to the refiner for manufacture into gas-
oline. (See Attachment 2) 

Another  contributor  to  gasoline  costs  is  tightness  in  our  Nation’s  gasoline  mar-
kets.  While  U.S.  refiners  are  producing  huge  volumes  of  products,  continued  strong 
demand  has  tightened  supply.  Gasoline  demand  currently  averages  approximately 
9 million barrels per day. Domestic refineries produce about 90 percent of U.S. gaso-
line supply, while about 10 percent is imported. These imports make up over 20 per-
cent  of  the  refined  product  demand  of  the  Northeast  U.S.  Thus,  steadily  increasing 
demand can only be met either by adding new domestic refinery capacity or by rely-
ing on more foreign gasoline imports. Unfortunately, the need to add more domestic 
gasoline  production  capacity—the  option  NPRA  believes  to  be  the  prudent  choice— 
is often thwarted by other public priorities. 
Experience  With  the  Aftermath  of  Hurricane  Katrina  Suggests  That  the 

Market Pricing System Is Working as Anticipated 

In  the  aftermath  of  Hurricane  Katrina  our  Nation  confronts  death,  injuries  and 
devastation  of  staggering  proportions.  The  images  of  the  tragedy  displayed  on  tele-
vision  and  other  media  underscore  the  human  toll  and  seeming  hopelessness  in 
ways  more  eloquent  and  compelling  than  could  ever  be  captured  in  testimony.  We 
share  both  the  sense  of  dismay  and  increased  humility  felt  by  all  Americans  before 
this  latest  reminder  of  nature’s  power  to  devastate  and  confound  the  best  efforts  of 
human  beings.  NPRA  offers  our  sympathy  and  prayers  to  those  who  have  suffered 
the loss of loved ones among family members, or their neighbors and colleagues, as 
well  as  to  those  who  have  lost  much  or  all  of  their  personal  assets  and  livelihood 
in this worst U.S. natural disaster. 

The  damage  left  in  Hurricane  Katrina’s  wake  made  significantly  worse  the  trou-
bling supply and price situation already discussed above. The market pricing system 
did  work  in  the  aftermath  of  that  disaster,  however.  Crude  oil  and  many  product 
prices  had  retreated  to  pre-Katrina  levels  by  last  Friday,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that 
considerable  offshore  crude  production  remains  out  of  service  and  about  5  percent 
of U.S. refinery capacity is still not operating due to storm damage. (See Attachment

3) The approach of Hurricane Rita has since resulted in increased futures prices this 
week  due  to  concerns  about  possible  additional  damage  in  the  Gulf  due  to  this 
storm. 
U.S. National Energy Policy Should Continue To Rely on Market Forces 

Continued  reliance  on  market  forces  provides  appropriate  market  signals  to  help 
balance  supply-and-demand  even  during  difficult  times.  President  Reagan  elimi-
nated price controls on oil products immediately upon taking office in 1981. He was 
outspoken  about  the  inefficiencies  and  added  costs  to  consumers  that  resulted  from 
America’s ten-year experiment with energy price controls. 

The energy price and allocation controls of the 1970s resulted in supply shortages 
in the form of long gas lines. Studies have shown that, although intended to reduce 
costs, controls actually resulted in increased costs and greater inconvenience for con-
sumers.  The  benefits  of  market  pricing  became  clear  soon  after  their  elimination. 
The  U.S.  Federal  Trade  Commission  stated  in  an  extensive  study  published  this 
June  that  ‘‘Gasoline  supply,  demand  and  competition  produced  relatively  low  and 
stable  annual  average  real  U.S.  gasoline  prices  from  1984  until  2004,  despite  sub-
stantial  increases  in  U.S.  gasoline  consumption’’  and  ‘‘. . .  For  most  of  the  past  20 
years, real annual average retail gasoline process in the U.S., including taxes, have 
been lower than at any time since 1919.’’ Price caps and other forms of price regula-
tion  are  no  more  effective  in  the  21st  century  than  they  turned  out  to  be  in  the 
1970s. Interference in market forces always creates inefficiencies in the marketplace 
and extra costs for consumers. 
The U.S. Refining Industry Is Diverse and Competitive 

Today’s  U.S.  refining  industry  is  highly  competitive.  Some  suggest  past  mergers 
are responsible for higher prices. The data do not support such claims. In fact, com-
panies  have  become  more  efficient  and  continue  to  compete  fiercely.  There  are  54 
refining  companies  in  the  U.S.,  hundreds  of  wholesale  and  marketing  companies, 
and  more  than  165,000  retail  outlets.  The  biggest  refiner  accounts  for  only  about 
13  percent  of  the  Nation’s  total  refining  capacity;  and  the  large  integrated  compa-
nies own and operate only about 10 percent of the retail outlets. The Federal Trade 
Commission  (FTC)  thoroughly  evaluates  every  merger  proposal,  holds  industry 
mergers to the highest standards of review, and subjects normal industry operations 
to a higher level of ongoing scrutiny. 

In  2004,  the  FTC  published  an  FTC  Staff  Study  ‘‘The  Petroleum  Industry:  Merg-
ers, Structural Change, and Antitrust Enforcement.’’ Among the points made in that 
publication  was  the  following:  ‘‘. . .  mergers  have  contributed  to  the  restructuring 
of  the  petroleum  industry  in  the  past  two  decades  but  have  had  only  a  limited  im-
pact on industry concentration. The FTC has investigated all major petroleum merg-
ers  and  required  relief  when  it  had  reason  to  believe  that  a  merger  was  likely  to 
lead to competitive harm. . .’’ 

Critics of mergers sometimes suggest that industry is able to affect prices because 
it  has  become  much  more  concentrated,  with  a  handful  of  companies  controlling 
most of the market. This is untrue. According to data compiled by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Commerce and by Public Citizen, in 2003 the four largest U.S. refining com-
panies  controlled  a  little  more  than  40  percent  of  the  Nation’s  refining  capacity.  In 
contrast,  the  top  four  companies  in  the  auto  manufacturing,  brewing,  tobacco,  floor 
coverings and breakfast cereals industries controlled between 80 percent and 90 per-
cent  of  the  market.  Further,  several  mergers  in  the  refining  industry  have  actively 
maintained  and  even  increased  refining  capacity  when,  without  such  consolidation, 
the  individual  refineries  involved  might  not  have  been  economically  viable.  One 
such  example  represents  over  550,000  barrels/day  of  capacity.  In  other  instances, 
Valero  Energy  Corporation  has  increased  the  productive  capacity  of  the  refineries 
it has acquired by an aggregate of nearly 400,000 barrels per day over the past sev-
eral years. 
Industry  Activities  Have  Been  Scrutinized  in  Similar  Past  Situations  but 

No Anticompetitive Behavior Has Been Found 

Tight  gasoline  market  conditions  have  often  led  to  calls  for  industry  investiga-
tions.  More  than  two  dozen  Federal  and  state  investigations  over  the  last  several 
decades  have  found  no  evidence  of  wrongdoing  or  illegal  activity  on  our  industry’s 
part. For example, after a 9-month FTC investigation into the causes of price spikes 
in local markets in the Midwest during the spring and summer of 2000, former FTC 
Chairman  Robert  Pitofsky  stated,  ‘‘There  were  many  causes  for  the  extraordinary 
price  spikes  in  Midwest  markets.  Importantly,  there  is  no  evidence  that  the  price 
increases  were  a  result  of  conspiracy  or  any  other  antitrust  violation.  Indeed,  most 
of  the  causes  were  beyond  the  immediate  control  of  the  oil  companies.’’  Similar  in-
vestigations before and since have reached the same conclusion.

A ‘‘Windfall Profits Tax’’ Could Stifle Needed Industry Investment 

109 

The  U.S.  had  a  ‘‘windfall  profit  tax’’  on  crude  oil  from  1980  until  1988.  That  tax, 
which  was  actually  an  ad  valorem  tax  imposed  on  crude  oil,  discouraged  crude  oil 
production in the United States and resulted in other market distortions. It was re-
pealed in 1988. 

Current  suggestions  for  re-imposition  of  a  windfall  profits  tax  on  refiners  reflect 
a  misunderstanding  of  refining  industry  economics.  In  the  ten-year  period  1993– 
2002, average return on investment in the refining industry was only about 5.5 per-
cent.  This  is  less  than  half  of  the  S&P  Industrials  average  return  of  12.7  percent 
for  the  same  period.  Refining  industry  profits  as  a  percentage  of  operating  capital 
are  not  excessive.  In  dollars,  they  seem  large  due  to  the  massive  scale  needed  to 
compete in a large, capital-intensive industry. For example, a new medium scale re-
finery  (100,000  to  200,000  b/d)  would  cost  $2  to  $3  billion.  In  short,  company  reve-
nues can be in the billions, but so, too are the costs of operations. 

The  FTC  June  2005  study  cited  above  had  the  following  comments  on  industry 
profits:  ‘‘Profits  play  necessary  and  important  roles  in  a  well-functioning  market 
economy. Recent oil company profits are high but have varied widely over time, over 
industry  segments  and  among  firms . . . Profits  also  compensate  firms  for  taking 
risks, such as the risks in the oil industry that war or terrorism may destroy crude 
production assets or, that new environmental requirements may require substantial 
new refinery capital investments.’’ 

Many  other  industries  have  higher  earnings  than  the  oil  industry.  Among  these 
are  telecommunication  services,  software,  semiconductors,  banking,  pharma-
ceuticals,  coal  and  real  estate,  to  name  just  a  few.  Imposition  of  a  windfall  profits 
tax on the industry would discourage investment at a time when significant capital 
commitments to all parts of the industry, including refining, will be needed. 
NPRA Does Not Tolerate Price Gouging 

There  have  been  allegations  of  price-gouging  by  unscrupulous  individuals  who 
seek to profit during the current time of national emergency and crisis. Federal and 
state  laws  prohibit  actions  of  this  kind  in  emergency  situations  like  the  present. 
Each  alleged  situation  should  be  thoroughly  investigated  by  the  appropriate  state 
and  Federal  authorities  and  prosecution  should  occur  when  the  law  has  been  bro-
ken. It is important, however, that illegal activity be clearly distinguished from the 
normal  operation  of  market  forces  attempting  to  allocate  available  product  in  a 
shortage or near-shortage situation. 
U.S. Policy Should Encourage Additional Domestic Refining Capacity 

Domestic  refining  capacity  is  a  scarce  asset.  There  are  currently  148  U.S.  refin-
eries  owned  by  54  companies  in  33  states,  with  total  crude  oil  processing  capacity 
at roughly 17 million barrels per day. In 1981, there were 325 refineries in the U.S. 
with  a  capacity  of  18.6  million  barrels  per  day.  Thus,  while  U.S.  demand  for  gaso-
line  has  increased  over  20  percent  in  the  last  twenty  years,  U.S.  refining  capacity 
has  decreased  by  10  percent.  No  new  refinery  has  been  built  in  the  United  States 
since 1976, and it will be difficult to change this situation. This is due to economic, 
public  policy,  and  political  considerations,  including  siting  costs,  environmental  re-
quirements,  a  history  of  low  refining  industry  profitability  and,  significantly,  ‘‘not 
in my backyard’’ (NIMBY) public attitudes. 

Nevertheless, existing refineries have been extensively updated to incorporate the 
technology needed to produce a large and predictable supply of clean fuels with sig-
nificantly  improved  environmental  performance.  Capacity  additions  have  taken 
place  at  many  facilities  as  well.  (See  Attachment  4)  Between  1985  and  2004,  U.S. 
refineries increased their total capacity to refine crude oil by 7.8 percent, from 15.7 
mm b/d in 1985 to 16.9 mm b/d in May 2004. This increase is equivalent to adding 
several  mid-size  refineries,  but  it  occurred  at  existing  facilities  to  take  advantage 
of  economics  of  scale.  Refiners  also  changed  processing  methods  to  broaden  the 
range of crude oil they can process and to allow them to produce more refined prod-
uct for each barrel of crude processed. (2005 FTC analysis) 

With  the  increased  returns  on  refining  operations  in  the  past  2  years,  it  is  very 
possible  that  additional  investment  in  refining  will  now  occur.  Some  modest  addi-
tions have been announced. But the increase in capacity at existing sites will prob-
ably not keep pace with the growth in U.S. demand for products, meaning that the 
Nation  is  increasing  its  reliance  on  imports  of  gasoline  and  other  petroleum  prod-
ucts each year. 

Proposed  capacity  expansions  can  often  become  controversial  and  contentious  at 
the  state  and  local  level,  even  when  necessary  to  produce  cleaner  fuels  pursuant  to 
regulatory  requirements.  We  hope  that  policymakers  will  recognize  the  importance 
of domestic refining capacity expansion to the successful implementation of the Na-

tion’s  environmental  policies,  especially  clean  fuels  programs.  The  Administration’s 
New  Source  Review  reform  program  is  a  solid  example  of  policy  modifications  that, 
while  maintaining  desired  environmental  protections,  will  provide  one  tool  to  help 
add and update capacity. 

NPRA  also  wants  to  recognize  a  provision  in  the  recently  enacted  energy  legisla-
tion  that  will  help  encourage  additional  refining  investment.  This  provision  allows 
50  percent  expensing  of  the  costs  associated  with  expanding  a  refinery’s  output  by 
more  than  5  percent.  The  refiner  must  have  a  signed  contract  for  the  work  by  1/ 
1/08, and the equipment must be put in service by 1/1/12. 

Common sense dictates that it is in our Nation’s best interest to manufacture the 
lion’s share of the petroleum products required for U.S. consumption in domestic re-
fineries  and  petrochemical  plants.  Nevertheless,  we  currently  import  more  than  62 
percent of the crude oil and oil products we consume. Reduced U.S. refining capacity 
clearly  affects  our  supply  of  refined  petroleum  products  and  the  flexibility  of  the 
supply system, particularly in times of unforeseen disruption or other stress. Unfor-
tunately, EIA currently has predicted ‘‘substantial growth’’ in refining capacity only 
in  the  Middle  East,  Central  and  South  America,  and  the  Asia/Pacific  region,  not  in 
the U.S. 
Refiners  Face  a  Blizzard  of  Regulatory  Requirements  Affecting  Both 

Facilities and Products 

Despite  the  powerful  factors  that  influence  gasoline  manufacturing,  cost  and  de-
mand, refiners are addressing current supply challenges and working hard to supply 
sufficient volumes of gasoline and other petroleum products to the public. Refineries 
have  been  running  at  very  high  levels,  producing  gasoline  and  distillate.  Refiners 
operated  at  high  utilization  rates  even  before  the  start  of  the  summer  driving  sea-
son. To put this in perspective, peak utilization rates for other manufacturers aver-
age about 82 percent. At times during summer, refiners often operate at rates close 
to 98 percent. However, such high rates cannot be sustained for long periods. 

In addition to coping with higher fuel costs and growing demand, refiners are im-
plementing  significant  transitions  in  major  gasoline  markets.  Nationwide,  the 
amount  of  sulfur  in  gasoline  will  be  reduced  to  an  average  of  30  parts  per  million 
(ppm) effective January 1, 2006, giving refiners an additional challenge in both the 
manufacture and distribution of fuel. 

Equally significant, California, New York, and Connecticut bans on use of MTBE 
are in effect. This is a major change affecting one-sixth of the Nation’s gasoline mar-
ket.  MTBE  use  as  an  oxygenate  in  reformulated  gasoline  accounted  for  as  much  as 
11  percent  of  RFG  supply  at  its  peak;  substitution  of  ethanol  for  MTBE  does  not 
replace  all  of  the  volume  lost  by  removing  MTBE.  (Ethanol’s  properties  generally 
cause  it  to  replace  only  about  50  percent  of  the  volume  lost  when  MTBE  is  re-
moved.)  This  lost  volume  must  be  supplied  by  additional  gasoline  or  gasoline 
blendstocks. Especially during a period of supply concerns it is in the Nation’s inter-
est  to  be  prudent  in  taking  any  action  that  affects  MTBE  use.  That  product  still  ac-
counts  for  1.6  percent  of  the  Nation’s  gasoline  supply  on  average,  but  it  provides  a 
larger portion of gasoline supplies in areas with RFG requirements that are not sub-
ject  to  an  MTBE  ban.  As  with  the  case  of  imports,  the  Northeast  is  most  dependent 
on these volumes. 

Refiners currently face the massive task of complying with fourteen new environ-
mental  regulatory  programs  with  significant  investment  requirements,  all  in  the 
same  2006–2012  time  frame.  (See  Attachment  5)  In  addition,  many  programs  start 
soon.  (See  Attachment  6)  For  the  most  part,  these  regulations  are  required  by  the 
Clean  Air  Act.  Some  will  require  additional  emission  reductions  at  facilities  and 
plants,  while  others  will  require  further  changes  in  clean  fuel  specifications.  NPRA 
estimates  that  refiners  are  in  the  process  of  investing  about  $20  billion  to  sharply 
reduce the sulfur content of gasoline and both highway and off-road diesel. Refiners 
will  face  additional  investment  requirements  to  deal  with  limitations  on  ether  use, 
as well as compliance costs for controls on Mobile Source Air Toxics and other limi-
tations.  These  costs  do  not  include  the  significant  additional  investments  needed  to 
comply with stationary source regulations that affect refineries. 

Other  potential  environmental  regulations  on  the  horizon  could  force  additional 
large  investment  requirements.  They  are:  the  challenges  posed  by  the  energy  bill’s 
mandated  increased  ethanol  use,  possible  additional  changes  in  diesel  fuel  content 
involving cetane, and potential proliferation of new fuel specifications driven by the 
need  for  states  to  comply  with  the  new  eight-hour  ozone  NAAQS  standard.  The  8- 
hour standard could also result in more regulations affecting facilities such as refin-
ers and petrochemical plants. 

These  are  just  some  of  the  pending  and  potential  air  quality  challenges  that  the 
industry  faces.  Refineries  are  also  subject  to  extensive  regulations  under  the  Clean

Water  Act,  Toxic  Substances  Control  Act,  Safe  Drinking  Water  Act,  Oil  Pollution 
Act  of  1990,  Resource  Conservation  and  Recovery  Act,  Emergency  Planning  and 
Community  Right-To-Know  (EPCRA),  Comprehensive  Environmental  Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), and other Federal statutes. The indus-
try  also  complies  with  OSHA  standards  and  many  state  statutes.  A  complete  list 
of Federal regulations impacting refineries is included with this statement. (See At-
tachment 7) * 

The  high  level  of  mandatory  environmental  expenditures  in  the  current  decade 
continues  a  trend  established  after  the  passage  of  the  Clean  Air  Act  Amendments 
in  1990.  The  American  Petroleum  Institute  (API)  estimates  that  refining  accounted 
for about 53 percent of the petroleum industry’s stated environmental expenditures 
of $98 billion (in 2004 dollars) between 1992 and 2001. 

Obviously,  refiners  face  a  daunting  task  in  completing  many  changes  to  deliver 
the  fuels  that  consumers  and  the  Nation’s  economy  require.  But  they  are  suc-
ceeding. And regardless of recent press stories, we need to remember that American 
gasoline  and  other  petroleum  products  have  long  been  low  when  compared  to  the 
price  consumers  in  other  large  industrialized  nations  pay  for  those  products.  The 
Federal  Trade  Commission  recently  found  that  ‘‘Gasoline  supply,  demand  and  com-
petition produced relatively low and stable annual average real U.S. gasoline prices 
from  1984  until  2004,  despite  substantial  increases  in  U.S.  gasoline  consumption.’’ 
A Key Government Advisory Panel Has Urged Greater Sensitivity to Supply 

Concerns 

The  National  Petroleum  Council  (NPC)  issued  a  landmark  report  on  the  state  of 
the refining industry in 2000. Given the limited return on investment in the indus-
try  and  the  capital  requirements  of  environmental  regulations,  the  NPC  urged  pol-
icymakers  to  pay  special  attention  to  the  timing  and  sequencing  of  any  changes  in 
product  specifications.  Failing  such  action,  the  report  cautioned  that  adverse  fuel 
supply  ramifications  may  result.  Unfortunately,  this  warning  has  been  widely  dis-
regarded.  On  June  22,  2004  Energy  Secretary  Abraham  asked  NPC  to  update  and 
expand  its  refining  study  and  a  report  was  released  last  December.  NPRA  again 
urges  policymakers  to  take  action  to  implement  NPC’s  study  recommendations  in 
order to address U.S. refining problems. 
NPRA  Recommendations  To  Add  U.S.  Refining  Capacity  and  Increase 

Future Oil Product and Natural Gas Supply 

Make increasing the Nation’s supply of oil, oil products and natural gas a number 
one  public  policy  priority.  Now,  and  for  many  years  in  the  past,  increasing  oil  and 
gas  supply  has  often  been  a  number  2  priority.  Thus,  oil  and  gas  supply  concerns 
have  been  secondary,  and  subjugated  to  whatever  policy  goal  was  more  politically 
popular  at  the  time.  Enactment  of  the  recent  Energy  Bill  is  a  first  step  to  making 
a first priority the supply of energy sources the Nation depends upon. 

Remove  barriers  to  increased  supplies  of  domestic  oil  and  gas  resources.  Recent 
criticism  about  the  concentration  of  America’s  energy  infrastructure  in  the  western 
Gulf  is  misplaced.  Refineries  and  other  important  onshore  facilities  have  been  wel-
come  in  this  area  but  not  in  many  other  parts  of  the  country.  Policymakers  have 
also  restricted  access  to  much-needed  offshore  oil  and  natural  gas  supplies  in  the 
eastern  Gulf  and  off  the  shores  of  California  and  the  East  Coast.  These  areas  must 
follow  the  example  of  Louisiana  and  many  other  states  in  sharing  these  energy  re-
sources with the rest of the Nation because they are sorely needed. 

Resist  tinkering  with  market  forces  when  the  supply/demand  balance  is  tight. 
Market interference that may initially be politically popular results in market ineffi-
ciencies  and  unnecessary  costs.  Policymakers  must  resist  turning  the  clock  back-
ward to the failed policies of the past. Experience with price constraints and alloca-
tion  controls  in  the  1970s  demonstrates  the  failure  of  price  regulation,  which  ad-
versely impacted both fuel supply and consumer cost. 

Consider  expanding  the  refining  tax  incentive  provision  in  the  Energy  Act.  Reduc-
ing  the  depreciation  period  for  refining  investments  from  10  to  7  or  5  years  would 
remove a current disincentive for refining investment. Changes could allow expens-
ing under the current language to take place as the investment is made rather than 
when the equipment is actually placed in service, or the percentage expensed could 
be increased as per the original legislation introduced by Senator Hatch. 

Review and streamline permitting procedures for new refinery construction and re-
finery capacity additions. Seek ways to encourage state authorities to recognize the 
national interest in more U.S. domestic capacity.

Keep a close eye on several upcoming regulatory programs that could have signifi-

cant impacts on gasoline and diesel supply. They are: 

112 

• Implementation  of  the  new  8-hour  ozone  NAAQS  standard.  The  current  imple-
mentation schedule determined by EPA has established ozone attainment dead-
lines  for  parts  of  the  country  that  will  be  impossible  to  meet.  EPA  has  to  date 
not  made  changes  that  would  provide  realistic  attainment  dates  for  the  areas. 
The result is that areas will be required to place sweeping new controls on both 
stationary  and  mobile  sources,  in  a  vain  effort  to  attain  the  unattainable.  The 
new lower-sulfur gasoline and ULSD diesel programs will provide significant re-
ductions  to  emissions  within  these  areas  once  implemented.  But  they  will  not 
come  soon  enough  to  be  considered  unless  the  current  unrealistic  schedule  is 
revised.  If  not,  the  result  will  be  additional  fuel  and  stationary  source  controls 
which  will  have  an  adverse  impact  on  fuel  supply  and  could  actually  reduce 
U.S. refining capacity. This issue needs immediate attention. 

• Design  and  implementation  of  the  credit  trading  program  for  the  ethanol  man-
date  (RFS)  contained  in  the  recent  Energy  Act.  This  mechanism  is  vital  to  in-
crease the chance that this program can be implemented next year without ad-
ditional gasoline supply disruption. Additional resources are needed within EPA 
to accomplish this key task. 

• Implementation of the ultra-low sulfur diesel highway diesel regulation. The re-
fining  industry  has  made  large  investments  to  meet  the  severe  reductions  in 
diesel  sulfur  that  take  effect  next  June.  We  remain  concerned  about  the  dis-
tribution  system’s  ability  to  deliver  this  material  at  the  required  15  ppm  level 
at  retail.  If  not  resolved,  these  problems  could  affect  America’s  critical  diesel 
supply.  Industry  is  working  with  EPA  on  this  issue,  but  time  left  to  solve  this 
problem is growing short. 

• Phase II of the MSAT (mobile source air toxics) rule for gasoline. Many refiners 
are concerned that this new regulation, which we expect next year, will be over-
ly  stringent  and  impact  gasoline  supply.  We  are  working  with  EPA  to  help  de-
velop  a  rule  that  protects  the  environment  and  avoids  a  reduction  in  gasoline 
supply. 

NPRA’s  members  are  dedicated  to  working  cooperatively  with  government,  at  all 
levels,  to  resolve  the  current  emergency  conditions  that  result  from  Hurricane 
Katrina. But we feel obliged to remind policymakers that action must also be taken 
to improve energy policy in order to increase supply and strengthen the Nation’s re-
fining infrastructure. We look forward to answering the Committee’s questions.

Notes: 

1. Longer compliance time for refineries in Alaska and Rocky Mountain states as 
well as small refineries covered by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement and 
Flexibility  Act  (SBREFA).  Additional  compliance  time  is  available  for  these  refin-
eries if they produce ultra-low sulfur highway diesel beginning in 2006. 

2.  The  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005,  includes  a  renewable  fuels  standard  (RFS) 
which mandates the use of 4 billion gallons of renewable fuels starting in 2006. The 
mandate  increases  to  7.5  billion  gallons  in  2012.  EPA  must  promulgate  regulations 
by August 2006. 

3. Longer compliance time for small refiners covered by SBREFA. 
4.  Approximately  twenty-five  states  currently  have  MTBE  bans  in  place  and  oth-

ers may pass similar bans in the future.

5. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 allows state governors to petition EPA to elimi-

nate the one pound RVP waiver for summer gasoline blended with ethanol. 

6. Phase II Mobile Source Air Toxics Rule to be proposed in February, 2006. Final 

rule expected in 2007. 

7.  The  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005,  caps  the  number  of  motor  fuels  available  for 
use  in  State  Implementation  Plans  at  the  same  level  as  those  already  in  use  as  of 
September  1,  2004.  EPA  must  publish  a  list  of  approved  fuels  by  state  and  PADD 
by November, 2005. 

8.  Under  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005,  EPA  must  promulgate  a  rule  to  imple-
ment  RFG  anti-backsliding  adjustments  that  will  maintain  emissions  at  2001  and 
2002 levels. 

9.  The  first  phase  of  the  off-road  diesel  sulfur  program  is  effective  in  2007,  and 

the second phase is effective in 2011. 

10.  Ozone  non-attainment  designations  made  April  2004.  State  Implementation 
Plans  (SIPs)  are  due  by  June  2007.  Compliance,  depending  upon  classification,  re-
quired  between  2007  and  2021.  EPA  promulgated  a  Phase  1  implementation  rule 
in April 2004, but has not yet promulgated a Phase 2 rule. 

11.  New  Source  Review  reform  (RMRR)  is  subject  to  litigation.  Refiners  face  un-
certainty in meeting regulatory requirements. The NSR program was upheld in part 
by the courts however, part of the rule was remanded to EPA. Refiners support the 
reforms. EPA is continuing enforcement actions under the old rules. 

12.  EPA  set  a  new  PM2.5 NAAQS  in  1997,  and  designated  nonattainment  areas 
in  December  2004,  but  has  not  yet  promulgated  implementation  standards.  EPA  is 
currently conducting a five-year review of the standard. 

13.  EPA  has  entered  into  a  consent  decree  with  environmental  organizations  to 
review,  and  possibly  revise,  the  New  Source  Performance  Standards  for  petroleum 
refineries. 

14. Proposed rule expected mid 2006. 
15. The Senate and the Administration support new authority for DHS to regulate 
chemical  security  which  will  impact  refiners.  Many  facilities  currently  meet  Coast 
Guard regulations under MTSA.

STATEMENT OF TYSON SLOCUM, RESEARCH DIRECTOR, 

PUBLIC CITIZEN’S ENERGY PROGRAM 

Mr.  SLOCUM.  Yes,  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  very  much.  Mem-
bers  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  very  much  for  having  me  here 
today. 

I  am  Tyson  Slocum.  I’m  Research  Director  of  the  Consumer  Ad-
vocacy  Group,  Public  Citizen.  We  represent  160,000  dues-paying 
members  across  the  United  States,  and  many  of  our  members  are 
also your constituents, I am sure. And as—you don’t need me to re-
mind  you  that  many  of  your  constituents  are  very  upset  at  rising 
energy  prices,  particularly  gasoline  prices.  And  with  good  reason. 
While,  obviously,  supply-and-demand  is  playing  a  role  here,  there 
is a lot more than just supply-and-demand that is leading to these 
higher  energy  prices.  And  we,  at  Public  Citizen,  along  with  other 
government  investigations,  have  conclusively  shown  that  there  are 
uncompetitive  practices,  within  the  U.S.  oil  industry,  that  are  di-
rectly  causing  these  higher  gasoline  prices,  and  Public  Citizen  re-
minds  Congress  that  it  is  their  duty  and  obligation  to  protect  con-
sumers by stopping this price-gouging and restoring competition to 
our energy markets. 

There have been some radical changes within the oil industry in 
just  the  last  few  years  that  are  a  direct  result  of  recent  mergers 
and  acquisitions  in  the  industry.  In  fact,  the  U.S.  Government  Ac-
countability Office recently documented that there were over 2,600 
mergers  within  the  U.S.  petroleum  industry  since  the  1990s.  And 
Public Citizen has shown that those recent mergers, particularly in 
the  U.S.  refining  sector,  have  directly  led  to  huge  consolidation  of 
control  over  refining  capacity,  which  then  leads  to  uncompetitive 
markets, which, of course, leads to higher gasoline prices. 

In  1993,  the  largest  five  owners  of  U.S.  oil  refineries  controlled 
34.5 percent of refining capacity. In 1993, the largest ten controlled 
55.6  percent  of  refining  capacity.  Now,  fast-forward  10  years  to 
2004, after a number of large mergers, and those numbers radically 
change.  The  largest  five  today  control  56.3  percent  of  refining  ca-
pacity.  That  means  the  largest  five  oil  refiners  today  control  more 
capacity than the largest ten did a decade ago, and the largest ten 
today control 83 percent of refining capacity. Those numbers clear-
ly  show  extreme  consolidation  in  the  downstream  market,  which 
makes  it  much  easier  to  engage  in  uncompetitive  practices,  which 
leads to higher gasoline prices. 

And the proof is in the numbers. According to EIA data, refining 
margins  have  been  skyrocketing  for  U.S.  oil  refiners.  In  1999,  the 
average  profit  margin  for  U.S.  oil  refiners  was  22.8  cents  a  gallon 
for  refined  gasoline.  By  2004,  that  had  jumped  80  percent,  to  40.8 
cents.  So,  it’s  no  question  that  the  huge  profits  by  the  largest  five 
oil  refiners  in  the  United  States,  since  2001,  have  been  $228  bil-
lion.  ExxonMobile  alone  leads  the  pack  with  profits  of  $89  billion 
over  that  time  period.  And  taking  a  look  at  Exxon’s  own  books, 
which are on view in their annual 10(k) reports filed with the Secu-
rities  and  Exchange  Commission,  shows  clearly  that  their  profit 
margins  for  their  U.S.  operations  is  what’s  driving  their  global 
profit  margins.  Exxon’s  average  return  on  capital  employed,  for 
their  total  company  worldwide,  was  23.8  percent.  But  when  you 
isolate their U.S. refining industry, it’s 28.6 percent. So, their rate-

of-return  on  their  capital  employed  for  their  U.S.  refining  oper-
ations  is  much  larger  than  their  global  profit  margins,  clearly  a 
sign  that  consolidated  markets  are  great  for  a  company’s  bottom 
line, but terrible for consumers at the pump. 

The  U.S.  Government  Accountability  Office  has  echoed  a  lot  of 
Public  Citizen’s  conclusions.  In  May  2004,  the  GAO  concluded, 
without  a  doubt,  that  recent  mergers  have  directly  led  to  higher 
gasoline  prices.  And  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  concluded,  in 
March  2001,  that  U.S.  oil  companies  were  intentionally  with-
holding  supplies  from  the  market  in  order  to  drive  prices  up.  And, 
as  we  heard  from  Senator  Wyden  a  few  minutes  ago,  the  FTC 
claims  that  it  does  not  have  power  to  go  after  unilateral  with-
holding. And so, we ask that Congress take action on that respect. 
And  the  last  issue  area  here  is  the  energy-trading  markets. 
These  are  sorely  under-regulated.  Congress,  in  2000,  passed  the 
Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which, among other things, 
greatly expanded the ability of energy traders to engage their busi-
ness  in  so-called  OTC  markets,  over-the-counter  derivatives  ex-
changes. 

I have a quote here from Dow Jones quoting one of these energy 
traders,  who  said,  quote,  on  September  2,  ‘‘There  are  energy  trad-
ers  who  made  so  much  money  this  week,  after  Hurricane  Katrina, 
that  they  won’t  have  to  punch  another  ticket  for  the  rest  of  the 
year,’’ end quote. 

Energy  traders  are  price-gouging  consumers.  They  are  holding 
Americans  hostage.  We  need  to  re-regulate  these  exchanges.  Con-
gress  needs  to  mandate  immediate  investigations  into  uncompeti-
tive  practices,  so  that  consumers  will  be  protected  from  this  price- 
gouging. 

Thank you very much. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Slocum follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF TYSON SLOCUM, RESEARCH DIRECTOR, 

PUBLIC CITIZEN’S ENERGY PROGRAM 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee on Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation for the opportunity to testify on the issue of gasoline prices. My 
name  is  Tyson  Slocum,  and  I  am  Research  Director  of  Public  Citizen’s  Energy  Pro-
gram. Public Citizen is a 34-year old public interest organization with over 160,000 
members  nationwide.  We  represent  consumer  interests  through  research,  public 
education, and grassroots organizing. 

I  last  testified  before  the  U.S.  Congress  on  how  lax  regulations  over  the  natural 
gas industry were leading to high prices, and have also testified before the Congress 
on  how  recent  mergers  in  the  domestic  oil  refining  industry  have  consolidated  con-
trol  over  gasoline,  making  it  easier  for  a  handful  of  companies  to  price-gouge  con-
sumers. 

This  price-gouging  has  not  only  been  officially  documented,  but  it  is  also  evident 
in  the  record  profits  enjoyed  by  large  oil  companies.  Since  2001,  the  five  largest  oil 
refining  companies  operating  in  America—ExxonMobil,  Valero,  ConocoPhillips, 
Shell, and BP—have recorded $228 billion in profits. While of course America’s tre-
mendous  appetite  for  gasoline  plays  a  role,  uncompetitive  practices  by  oil  corpora-
tions  are  a  cause—and  not  OPEC  or  environmental  laws—of  high  gasoline  prices 
around the country. 

Sixty-two  percent  of  the  oil  consumed  in  America  is  used  as  fuel  for  cars  and 
trucks.  Ten  percent  is  for  residential  home  heating  oil,  with  the  remainder  largely 
for  various  industrial  and  agricultural  processes  (only  2  percent  is  to  fuel  electric

power).1 Gasoline prices in the U.S. average $2.96/gallon, up 60 percent from 1 year 
ago.2 Some  states  are  addressing  these  higher  prices  by  suspending  taxes  on  gaso-
line.  Public  Citizen  does  not  support  such  a  move,  as  it  not  only  fails  to  address 
the  underlying  market  problems  causing  higher  prices,  but  reduces  revenues  that 
states need to help finance solutions such as mass transit. 

Oil and gasoline prices were rising long before Hurricane Katrina wreaked havoc. 
U.S.  gasoline  prices  jumped  14  percent  from  July  25  to  Aug.  22.  Indeed,  profits  for 
U.S.  oil  refiners  have  been  at  record  highs.  In  1999,  U.S.  oil  refiners  made  22.8 
cents for every gallon of gasoline refined from crude oil. By 2004, they were making 
40.8 cents for every gallon of gasoline refined, a 79 percent jump.3 

Faced with these facts, Congress and the White House instead recently passed en-
ergy  legislation  that  does  nothing  to  address  any  of  the  fundamental  problems 
plaguing America’s energy policies—after all, if it did, why are we having this hear-
ing today? As a whole, the Senate voted to approve H.R. 6, the ‘‘comprehensive’’ en-
ergy  bill,  by  a  vote  of  74  to  26,4 even  though  the  only  ‘‘comprehensive’’  aspect  of 
the legislation is the $6 billion in subsidies to big oil companies.5 The only possible 
explanation for why Congress would bestow these subsidies on oil companies are the 
$52  million  in  campaign  contributions  by  the  oil  industry,  with  80  percent  of  that 
total going to Republicans.6 

Remember, environmental regulations are not restricting oil drilling in the United 
States.  An  Interior  Department  study  concludes  that  Federal  leasing  restrictions— 
in  the  form  of  wilderness  designations  and  other  leasing  restrictions—completely 
block drilling of only 15.5 percent of the oil in the five major U.S. production basins 
on  104  million  acres  stretching  from  Montana  to  New  Mexico.  While  only  15.5  per-
cent  is  totally  off-limits,  57  percent  of  America’s  oil  reserves  on  Federal  land  are 
fully available for drilling, with the remaining 27.5 percent featuring partial limita-
tions  on  drilling.7 This  report  contradicts  industry  claims  that  environmental  laws 
are squelching natural gas production. 

Congress can restore accountability to oil and gas markets and protect consumers 

by supporting Public Citizen’s 5-point reform plan: 

• Implement a windfall profits tax or enact temporary price caps. 
• Launch an immediate investigation, including the use of subpoena, into uncom-

petitive practices by oil companies. 

• Reevaluate recent mergers, particularly in the refining sector. 
• Re-regulate energy trading exchanges to restore transparency. 
• Improve fuel economy standards to reduce demand. 

Recent Mergers Create Uncompetitive Markets 

Over 2,600 mergers have been approved in the U.S. petroleum industry since the 
1990s.  In  just  the  last  few  years,  mergers  between  giant  oil  companies—such  as 
Exxon  and  Mobil,  Chevron  and  Texaco,  Conoco  and  Phillips—have  resulted  in  just 
a  few  companies  controlling  a  significant  amount  of  America’s  gasoline,  squelching 
competition. A number of independent refineries have been closed, some due to un-
competitive actions by larger oil companies, further restricting capacity. As a result, 
consumers are paying more at the pump than they would if they had access to com-
petitive  markets  and  five  oil  companies  are  reaping  some  of  the  largest  profits  in 
history. 

Although  the  U.S.  is  the  third  largest  oil  producing  nation  in  the  world,  we  con-
sume  25  percent  of  the  world’s  oil  every  day,  forcing  us  to  import  oil.  We  are  also

the  third  largest  oil  producing  nation  in  the  world,  providing  us  with  42  percent  of 
our daily oil and gasoline needs.8 

Middle  Eastern  OPEC  nations  supply  only  14  percent  of  America’s  oil  and  gas. 
Other  OPEC  nations—Indonesia,  Nigeria,  Venezuela—supply  13  percent,  and  non- 
OPEC nations—such as Canada, Mexico, Norway, and England—provide 31 percent 
of our oil and gas needs.9 

So  it  isn’t  so  much  an  OPEC  oil  cartel,  but  rather  a  corporate  cartel  that  should 
concern policymakers. Consider that the top five oil companies also produce 14 per-
cent  of  the  world’s  oil.  Combined,  these  five  companies  produce  10  million  barrels 
of oil a day—more than Saudi Arabia’s 9 million barrels of oil a day. 

The  consolidation  of  downstream  assets—particularly  refineries—also  plays  a  big 
role  in  determining  the  price  of  a  gallon  of  gas.  Recent  mergers  have  resulted  in 
dangerously concentrated levels of ownership over U.S. oil refining. 

In 1993, the five largest U.S. oil refining companies controlled 34.5 percent of do-
mestic oil refinery capacity; the top ten companies controlled 55.6 percent. By 2004, 
the  top  5—ConocoPhillips,  Valero,  ExxonMobil,  Shell  and  BP—controlled  56.3  per-
cent and the top ten refiners controlled 83 percent. As a result of all of these recent 
mergers,  the  largest  5  oil  refiners  today  control  more  capacity  than  the  largest  10 
did  a  decade  ago.  This  dramatic  increase  in  the  control  of  just  the  top  five  compa-
nies makes it easier for oil companies to manipulate gasoline by intentionally with-
holding  supplies  in  order  to  drive  up  prices.  Because  most  of  the  largest  companies 
are also vertically integrated, they enjoy significant market share in oil drilling and 
retail sales. 

The  proof  is  in  the  numbers.  Profit  margins  for  U.S.  oil  refiners  have  been  at 
record  highs.  In  1999,  U.S.  oil  refiners  made  22.8  cents  for  every  gallon  of  gasoline 
refined from crude oil. By 2004, they were making 40.8 cents for every gallon of gas-
oline  refined,  a  79  percent  jump.  It  is  no  coincidence  that  oil  corporation  profits— 
including refining—are enjoying record highs. 

Consumer  advocates  like  Public  Citizen  aren’t  the  only  ones  saying  this.  A  May 
2004  U.S.  Government  Accountability  Office  report 10 agreed  with  Public  Citizen 
that recent mergers in the oil industry have directly led to higher prices. It is impor-
tant  to  note,  however,  that  this  GAO  report  severely  underestimates  the  impact 
mergers  have  on  prices  because  their  price  analysis  stops  in  2000—long  before  the 
mergers that created ChevronTexaco, ConocoPhillips, and Valero-Ultramar/Diamond 
Shamrock-Premcor. 

And in March 2001, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission concluded in its Midwest 

Gasoline Price Investigation: 11 

The  completed  [FTC]  investigation  uncovered  no  evidence  of  collusion  or  any 
other antitrust violation. In fact, the varying responses of industry participants 
to the [gasoline] price spike suggests that the firms were engaged in individual, 
not  coordinated,  conduct.  Prices  rose  both  because  of  factors  beyond  the  indus-
try’s  immediate  control  and  because  of  conscious  (but  independent)  choices  by 
industry participants . . . each industry participant acted unilaterally and fol-
lowed  individual  profit-maximization  strategies . . . It  is  not  the  purpose  of 
this  report—with  the  benefit  of  hindsight—to  criticize  the  choices  made  by  the 
industry  participants.  Nonetheless,  a  significant  part  of  the  supply  reduction 
was caused by the investment decisions of three firms . . . One firm increased 
its summer-grade RFG [reformulated gasoline] production substantially and, as 
a  result,  had  excess  supplies  of  RFG  available  and  had  additional  capacity  to 
produce  more  RFG  at  the  time  of  the  price  spike.  This  firm  did  sell  off  some 
inventoried RFG, but it limited its response because selling extra supply would 
have  pushed  down  prices  and  thereby  reduced  the  profitability  of  its  existing 
RFG  sales.  An  executive  of  this  company  made  clear  that  he  would  rather  sell 
less gasoline and earn a higher margin on each gallon sold than sell more gaso-
line  and  earn  a  lower  margin.  Another  employee  of  this  firm  raised  concerns 
about  oversupplying  the  market  and  thereby  reducing  the  high  market  prices.  A 
decision  to  limit  supply  does  not  violate  the  antitrust  la  ws,  absent  some  agree-
ment  among  firms.  Firms  that  withheld  or  delayed  shipping  additional  supply

in  the  face  of  a  price  spike  did  not  violate  the  antitrust  laws.  In  each  instance, 
the firms chose strategies they thought would maximize their profits. 

Although  Federal  investigators  found  ample  evidence  of  oil  companies  inten-
tionally  withholding  supplies  from  the  market  in  the  Summer  of  2000,  the  govern-
ment has not taken any action to prevent recurrence. 

A  Congressional  investigation  uncovered  internal  memos  written  by  major  oil 
companies  operating  in  the  U.S.  discussing  their  successful  strategies  to  maximize 
profits by forcing independent refineries out of business, resulting in tighter refinery 
capacity.  From  1995–2002,  97  percent  of  the  more  than  920,000  barrels  of  oil  per 
day of capacity that has been shut down were owned by smaller, independent refin-
ers. Were this capacity to be in operation today, refiners could use it to better meet 
today’s reformulated gasoline blend needs. 

An  internal  Mobil  document  helps  explain  why  independent  refineries  had  such 
a  tough  time.  The  Mobil  document  highlights  the  connection  between  an  inde-
pendent  refiner  producing  cleaner  burning  California  Air  Resources  Board  (CARB) 
gasoline, the lower price of gasoline that would result from the refinery being in op-
eration, and the need to prevent the independent refiner from operating: 

If  Powerine  re-starts  and  gets  the  small  refiner  exemption,  I  believe  the  CARB 
market premium will be impacted. Could be as much as 2–3 cpg (cents per gal-
lon)  . . .  The  re-start  of  Powerine,  which  results  in  20–25  TBD  (thousand  bar-
rels  per  day)  of  gasoline  supply  . . .  could  . . .  effectively  set  the  CARB  pre-
mium  a  couple  of  cpg  lower  . . .  Needless  to  say,  we  would  all  like  to  see 
Powerine stay down. Full court press is warranted in this case.12 

FTC Not Adequately Protecting Consumers 

At  the  same  time  that  the  FTC  concludes  that  refining  markets  are  uncompeti-
tive,  the  agency  consistently  allows  refining  capacity  to  be  controlled  by  fewer 
hands,  allowing  companies  to  keep  most  of  their  refining  assets  when  they  merge, 
as a recent overview of FTC-approved mergers demonstrates. 

The  major  condition  demanded  by  the  FTC  for  approval  of  the  August  2002 
ConocoPhillips  merger,  was  that  the  company  had  to  sell  two  of  its  refineries—rep-
resenting less than 4 percent of its domestic refining capacity. Phillips was required 
only  to  sell  a  Utah  refinery,  and  Conoco  had  to  sell  a  Colorado  refinery.  But  even 
with  this  forced  sale,  ConocoPhillips  remains  by  far  the  largest  domestic  refiner, 
controlling  refineries  with  capacity  of  2.2  million  barrels  of  oil  per  day—or  13  per-
cent of America’s entire capacity. 

The  major  condition 

the  FTC  set  when  approving 

the  October  2001 
ChevronTexaco merger, was that Texaco had to sell its shares in two of its joint re-
fining and marketing enterprises (Equilon and Motiva). Prior to the merger, Texaco 
had  a  44  percent  stake  in  Equilon,  with  Shell  owning  the  rest;  Texaco  owned  31 
percent  of  Motiva,  with  the  national  oil  company  of  Saudi  Arabia  (Saudi  Aramco) 
also  owning  31  percent,  and  Royal  Dutch  Shell  owning  the  remaining  38  percent. 
The  FTC  allowed  Shell  to  purchase  100  percent  of  Equilon,  and  Shell  and  Saudi 
Aramco  bought  out  Texaco’s  share  of  Motiva,  leaving  Motiva  a  50–50  venture  be-
tween Shell and Saudi Aramco. 

Prior  to  the  merger,  Texaco’s  share  of  Equilon  and  Motiva  refinery  capacity 
equaled more than 500,000 barrels of oil per day—which was simply scooped up by 
another  member  of  the  elite  top  five  companies,  Shell.  Had  the  FTC  forced  Texaco 
to sell its share to a smaller, independent company, the stranglehold by the Nation’s 
largest oil companies could have been weakened. 

As  a  condition  of  the  1999  merger  creating  ExxonMobil,  Exxon  had  to  sell  some 
of its gas retail stations in the Northeast U.S. and a single oil refinery in California. 
Valero Energy, the Nation’s fifth largest owner of oil refineries, purchased these as-
sets. So, just as with the ChevronTexaco merger, the inadequacy of the forced dives-
titure mandated by the FTC was compounded by the fact that the assets were sim-
ply transferred to another large oil company, ensuring that the consolidation of the 
largest companies remained high. 

The  sale  of  the  Golden  Eagle  refinery  was  ordered  by  the  FTC  as  a  condition  of 
Valero’s purchase of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock in 2001. Just as with ExxonMobil 
and  ChevronTexaco,  Valero  sold  the  refinery,  along  with  70  retail  gas  stations,  to 
another  large  company,  Tesoro.  But  while  the  FTC  forced  Valero  to  sell  one  of  its 
four  California  refineries,  the  agency  allowed  the  company  to  purchase  Orion 
Refining’s  only  refinery  in  July  2003,  and  then,  just  last  month,  approved  Valero’s 
purchase of the U.S. oil refinery company Premcor. This acquisition of Orion’s Lou-

to divest one of its California refineries. 
Over-the-Counter Energy Disclosure Is Underegulated 

Contracts representing hundreds of millions of barrels of oil are traded every day 
on  the  London  and  New  York  trading  exchanges.  An  increasing  share  of  this  trad-
ing, however, has been moving off regulated exchanges such as the New York Mer-
cantile  Exchange  (NYMEX),  and  into  unregulated  Over-the-Counter  (OTC)  ex-
changes.  The  Bank  of  International  Settlements  estimates  that  in  2004,  the  global 
OTC market has grown to over $248 trillion. Growth in global OTC derivatives mar-
kets  has  averaged  31.6  percent  since  1990.13 Traders  operating  on  exchanges  like 
NYMEX  are  required  to  disclose  significant  detail  of  their  trades  to  Federal  regu-
lators.  But  traders  in  OTC  exchanges  are  not  required  to  disclose  such  information 
allowing companies like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and hedge funds to escape 
Federal oversight and more easily engage in manipulation strategies. 

A  recent  Congressional  investigation  concluded  that  ‘‘crude  oil  prices  are  affected 
by  trading  not  only  on  regulated  exchanges  like  the  NYMEX,  but  also  on  unregu-
lated OTC markets that have become major trading centers for energy contracts and 
derivatives.  The  lack  of  information  on  prices  and  large  positions  in  OTC  markets 
makes  it  difficult  in  many  instances,  if  not  impossible  in  practice,  to  determine 
whether traders have manipulated crude oil prices.’’ 14 

Public  Citizen  has  supported  efforts  to  re-regulate  energy  trading  by  subjecting 
OTC markets to tougher oversight. But the latest such effort, an amendment to the 
energy bill, was rejected by the Senate by a vote of 55–44 in June 2003.15 

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has a troublesome streak of ‘‘revolv-
ing  door’’  appointments  and  hiring  which  may  further  hamper  the  ability  of  the 
agency  to  effectively  regulate  the  energy  trading  industry.  In  August  2004,  CFTC 
Chairman James Newsome left the Commission to accept a $1 million yearly salary 
as President of NYMEX, the world’s largest energy futures marketplace. Just weeks 
later, Scott Parsons, the CFTC’s Chief Operating Officer, resigned to become Execu-
tive  Vice  President  for  Government  Affairs  at  the  Managed  Funds  Association,  a 
hedge-fund  industry  group  that  figures  prominently  in  energy  derivatives  markets. 
Such prominent defections hampers the CFTC’s ability to protect consumers. 
Raise Fuel Economy Standards To Lower Our Oil Consumption 

Due  to  increasing  numbers  of  gas-guzzling  SUVs  on  America’s  roads  and  the  ab-
sence of meaningful increases in government-set fuel economy standards, America’s 
fuel economy standards are lower today than a decade ago. 

The  Environmental  Protection  Agency  found  that  the  average  fuel  economy  of 
2005 vehicles is 21 miles per gallon (mpg), compared to 22.1 mpg in 1988—a 5 per-
cent  decline.16 This  drop  is  attributable  to  the  fact  that  fuel  economy  standards 
haven’t  been  meaningfully  increased  since  the  1980s.  And  sales  of  fuel  inefficient 
SUVs and pickups have exploded: in 1987, 28 percent of new vehicles sold were light 
trucks, compared to 50 percent in 2005. 

Billions of gallons of oil could be saved if significant fuel economy increases were 
mandated. Improving fuel economy standards for passenger vehicles from 27.5 to 40 
mpg,  and  for  light  trucks  (including  SUVs  and  vans)  from  22.2 17 to  27.5  mpg  by 
2015 (for a combined fleet average of 34 miles per gallon), would reduce our gasoline 
consumption  by  one-third.  But  the  U.S.  Senate  soundly  rejected  such  a  move  on 
June 23, 2005 by a vote of 67 to 28 (5 abstentions).18 

Dramatic  reductions  in  consumption  will  not  only  reduce  strain  on  America’s  re-
finery  output,  but  also  on  Americans’  pocketbooks.  Comparing  two  Americans  with 
identical  driving  habits,  one  driving  an  SUV  and  one  a  regular  passenger  car,  re-
veals  that  the  person  driving  the  passenger  car  saves  $510  a  year  due  to  the  supe-
rior fuel economy of passenger cars compared to light trucks.

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Mr. Slocum. 
Now,  next  is  Guy  Caruso,  from  Energy  Information  Administra-

tion. Nice to see you again, Mr. Caruso. 

STATEMENT OF GUY CARUSO, ADMINISTRATOR, 

ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION, 

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY 

Mr.  CARUSO.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  It’s  a  pleas-
ure  to  be  here  to  present  the  Energy  Information  Administration’s 
views of the energy developments in the aftermath of Katrina. 

Of course, we don’t know what’s going to happen with Hurricane 
Rita,  but  it  certainly  adds  another  element  of  uncertainty  to  the 
outlook that I’m about to present. 

Even before Katrina, crude oil and petroleum-product prices were 
setting  records.  On  August  26,  the  near-month  price  of  crude  on 
the  New  York  Mercantile  Exchange  closed  at  over  $66,  which  was 
more  than  50  percent  higher  than  a  year  earlier.  And  on  August 
29, both gasoline and diesel prices were already at about $2.60 per 
gallon, substantially higher than one year ago. Oil prices worldwide 
have been rising since 2002, due, in large part, to robust global oil- 
demand  growth,  which  has  used  up  most  of  the  world’s  productive 
capacity for crude oil. 

As we sit here today, with the shut-in of the Gulf of Mexico pro-
duction,  the  world  is  operating  at  virtually  100  percent  of  produc-
tive capacity for crude oil. Refineries also have been running at in-
creasingly  high  levels  of  utilization,  not  only  in  the  United  States, 
but  elsewhere,  as  demand  for  gasoline  and  diesel  fuel,  along  with 
unexpected  refinery  outages,  have  caused  tightness  in  both  gaso-
line and diesel fuel markets. 

Hurricane  Katrina  wrought  incredible  devastation  to  the  central 
Gulf  Coast,  particularly  in  terms  of  human  suffering,  but  also  in 
economic  impacts  that  have  spread  well  beyond  the  stricken  area. 
At its peak impact, Katrina had shut down over 25 percent of U.S. 
crude  oil  production,  almost  20  percent  of  natural  gas  production, 
and 20 percent of imports into the various ports, as well as 10 per-
cent  of  domestic  refinery  production.  Currently,  over  900,000  bar-
rels a day remain shut-in, in the Gulf of Mexico. The four refineries 
that  remain  out,  and  are  likely  to  be  out  for  several  months, 
produce almost 900,000 barrels a day of refined products and about 
4 percent of total U.S. gasoline. 

In  the  immediate  aftermath  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  with  the  ex-
tent  of  actual  damage  still  unknown,  crude  oil  prices  briefly 
reached  over  $70  per  barrel.  Since  then,  they  have  fluctuated  be-
tween $63 and $68, and are currently exhibiting extreme volatility 
over the uncertainty with respect to Hurricane Rita. 

Crude oil prices have come back down a bit because of the better 
position  with  respect  to  inventories—making  available  Strategic 
Petroleum  Reserve  oil  and  the  International  Energy  Agency’s  deci-
sions.  However,  the  most  significant  impact  has  been  on  gasoline 
prices,  largely  because  of  the  wide  spread  between  the  crude  oil 
price and gasoline prices. They reached a peak of $3.07 per gallon, 
as of Labor Day, but have come down, most recently, to—our most 
recent survey—to $2.78. This was largely because the main impact 
of Katrina was on refined product, the system of refineries and dis-

tribution through the Colonial and Plantation Pipelines, as well as 
the shut down of the Capline, which serves Midwest refineries. 

Before  Katrina,  inventories  of  gasoline  were  already  very  tight, 
and they have become even tighter as a result of Katrina. Although 
EIA  does  not  investigate  or  enforce  issues  such  have  been  men-
tioned  as  being  under  the  responsibility  of  the  FTC  or  others,  we 
do  look  at  how  prices  do  get  passed  through  to  consumers,  and 
have done so over a number of years. And clearly there is a lag ef-
fect  when  there’s  a  spike  in  crude  oil,  and  particularly  in  refined 
product prices. Clearly what we’ve seen in Katrina exceeds the typ-
ical  development  in  market  pass-through.  However,  it’s  clear  that 
whenever  there  is  a  crude  oil  or  product  price  increase,  it  does  get 
lagged—there is a lag between the time of the spot wholesale price 
increase and when it reaches the retailer. 

Now, in this case, it—an early look at the data from post-Katrina 
is  that  there  was  both  a  sharper  rise  and  a  sharper  fall  in  retail 
prices  compared  to  previous  situations.  So,  I  think  it’s  largely  be-
cause of the sheer magnitude of the increase we had at one point— 
a  $1.40  per  gallon  increase  in  spot  prices  for  gasoline  within  just 
several days—that we’ve never seen before. So, partly it’s the sheer 
magnitude  of  the  pass-through,  as  well  as  the  other  factors,  such 
as the lag effect, as I mentioned. 

Second,  independent  marketers,  who  typically  have  some  of  the 
lowest  prices  in  the  retail  markets,  probably  were  affected  a  bit 
more  than  the  branded  stations.  And  that  has  certainly  been  seen 
in many states. 

Clearly,  the  near-term  outlook  will  depend  very  much  on  how 
quickly  the  refineries  come  back  and  our  infrastructure  recovers. 
But,  even  with  that  recovery,  we  expect  relatively  high  prices  for 
gasoline and heating oil as we look out into the winter months. 

I’d  be  happy  to  provide  more  detail,  either  through  the  Short- 
Term  Energy  Outlook,  which  we  publish  every  month,  or  in  the 
Q&A session. 

Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, again, for this opportunity. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Caruso follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF GUY CARUSO, ADMINISTRATOR, 

ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY 

Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee: 
I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss recent develop-
ments  in  energy  markets  and  the  impacts  of  Hurricane  Katrina  on  gasoline  prices. 
The  Energy  Information  Administration  (EIA)  is  the  independent  statistical  and 
analytical  agency  in  the  Department  of  Energy.  We  do  not  promote,  formulate,  or 
take  positions  on  policy  issues,  and  our  views  should  not  be  construed  as  rep-
resenting those of the Department of Energy or the Administration. 

Before  I  begin  I  want  to  note  that  the  outlook  for  oil  markets  presented  in  this 
testimony  does  not  include  any  assumption  about  the  potential  for  significant  dis-
ruption to energy markets caused by Hurricane Rita. 

Even  before  Hurricane  Katrina  struck,  crude  oil  and  petroleum  product  prices 
were  setting  records.  On  August  26,  the  near-month  price  of  crude  oil  on  the  New 
York Mercantile Exchange closed at over $66 per barrel, which was $23 per barrel, 
or more than 50 percent, higher than a year earlier. On August 29, as the hurricane 
made  landfall,  average  gasoline  prices  stood  at  $2.61  per  gallon,  74  cents  higher 
than  1  year  earlier,  and  diesel  prices  were  $2.59,  or  72  cents  higher.  Oil  prices 
worldwide had been rising steadily since 2002, due in large part to growth in global 
demand, which has used up much of the world’s surplus production capacity. Refin-
eries  have  been  running  at  increasingly  high  levels  of  utilization  in  many  parts  of 
the world, including the United States. High production of distillate fuels, and high-

128 

er-than-average  refinery  outages  this  Summer,  added  to  tightness  in  gasoline  mar-
kets. 

Hurricane Katrina wrought incredible devastation on the central Gulf Coast, most 
importantly  in  terms  of  human  suffering,  but  also  in  economic  impacts  that  have 
spread  well  beyond  the  stricken  area.  At  its  peak  impact,  Katrina  shut  down  over 
25 percent of U.S. crude oil production, 20 percent of crude imports, and 10 percent 
of  domestic  refinery  capacity.  Many  of  these  facilities  have  since  restarted,  but 
about  877,000  barrels  per  day  of  crude  oil  production  are  offline  as  of  September 
20  (an  increase  of  about  40,000  barrels  since  the  previous  day,  as  a  result  of  prep-
arations  for  Hurricane  Rita),  along  with  four  major  refineries  with  a  total  distilla-
tion capacity of 880,000 barrels per day. At recent historical yields, these four refin-
eries  produce  approximately  350,000  barrels  per  day  of  gasoline,  accounting  for 
about 4 percent of total U.S. gasoline production of 8.5 million barrels per day. 

In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, with the extent of actual dam-
age still largely unknown, crude oil prices rose briefly over $70 per barrel, up more 
than  $4  in  less  than  48  hours,  but  in  less  than  a  week  had  fallen  below  their  pre- 
storm  levels.  The  impact  on  crude  oil  prices  was  undoubtedly  lessened  by  the  rel-
atively robust inventory levels before the storm, and by quick assurance that refin-
ers  unable  to  obtain  adequate  crude  oil  supplies  would  be  able  to  borrow  by  way 
of  time  exchanges  from  the  Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve,  even  before  the  coordi-
nated release of stocks by the United States and other members of the International 
Energy Agency was announced on Friday, September 2. 

The  more  significant  price  impact,  however,  was  on  finished  petroleum  products, 
especially  gasoline.  Spot  prices  (the  level  at  which  large  volumes  are  sold  by  refin-
ers,  importers,  and  traders)  for  gasoline  rose  as  much  as  $1.40  per  gallon,  east  of 
the Rockies, within 3 days. The sudden increase in product prices, far exceeding the 
rise  in  crude  oil  prices,  represented  an  increase  in  the  so-called  ‘‘crack  spread,’’  de-
fined  as  the  difference  between  a  petroleum  product  price  and  the  underlying  price 
of crude oil. 

EIA survey data showed that the national average retail price for regular gasoline 
price rose 46 cents in a week to $3.07 per gallon as of Labor Day. While prices rose 
throughout the country, the East Coast experienced the largest price increase. 

The  seemingly  disproportionate  change  in  finished  product  prices  reflects  the  se-
verity and expected persistence of Hurricane Katrina’s impact on refining operations 
in  the  Gulf.  Additionally,  the  shutdown  of  the  Capline,  a  major  crude  oil  pipeline 
from  Louisiana  to  the  Midwest,  reduced  crude  supplies  to  refineries  there,  causing 
several to temporarily reduce operations. Finally, the temporary closure of the Colo-
nial  and  Plantation  product  pipelines  virtually  halted  distribution  of  products  from 
the Gulf Coast to the lower East Coast, as far north as Baltimore, in the aftermath 
of  Katrina.  In  the  first  week  following  the  storm,  rumors  abounded  that  supplies 
would run out, particularly for gasoline, which nearly became a self-fulfilling proph-
ecy  as  thousands  of  drivers  rushed  to  top  off  their  tanks.  Gasoline  inventories, 
which  were  already  at  their  seasonal  low  point  before  the  storm,  dropped  another 
4  million  barrels  in  the  next  week,  with  the  Southeast,  due  to  its  dependence  on 
the  refineries  and  pipelines  most  affected,  showing  the  largest  decline.  As  of  Sep-
tember  9,  total  gasoline  inventories  were  192.0  million  barrels  (data  for  last  week 
will  be  released  today,  September  21).  It  should  be  recognized  that  supplies  of  all 
petroleum  products  will  likely  remain  tight  in  the  coming  weeks,  and  possibly 
months, although increased imports may make up some of the overall product short-
fall. 

While  recent  movements  in  crack  spreads  were  heavily  influenced  by  the  effects 
of  Hurricane  Katrina,  crack  spreads  were  trending  upwards  well  before  the  storm 
struck. As U.S. refineries have operated increasingly close to full capacity and prod-
uct demand continues to rise, the balance of demand must increasingly be made up 
from  imports.  This,  in  turn,  requires  a  sufficient  price  differential  between  the 
United States and other world markets to attract the needed imports. Although this 
does  not  increase  the  cost  of  refining  products  in  the  United  States,  it  does  tend  to 
increase the market value of finished petroleum products relative to crude oil. 

Wholesale petroleum product prices, like those of crude oil, have fallen back from 
their  peak  levels.  Similarly,  the  U.S.  average  retail  gasoline  price  has  dropped—by 
28  cents  per  gallon  in  the  past  2  weeks—and,  as  of  Monday,  September  19,  was 
about 18 cents higher than its pre-hurricane level. 

The  speed  and  amount  of  gasoline  price  increases  following  Hurricane  Katrina, 
particularly when compared to the slower decline over the past few weeks, have sug-
gested  to  some  that  price-gouging  or  other  unacceptable  behavior  might  be  taking 
place in gasoline markets. While EIA’s mission does not include investigation or en-
forcement  functions,  we  have  long  studied  the  manner  in  which  price  changes  are 
passed from wholesale to retail markets for gasoline and diesel fuel and have found 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  15:23 May 10, 2011 Jkt 066218 PO 00000 Frm 00132 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\66218.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

129 

that  there  are,  under  normal  conditions,  very  consistent  pass-through  patterns, 
which  vary  somewhat  regionally  and  between  products.  The  key  concept  is  that  of 
a  ‘‘distributed  lag,’’  in  which  a  change  in  spot  prices  in  a  given  week  is  passed 
through  to  retail  markets  over  the  next  several  weeks,  with  the  largest  portion  in 
the first week, and progressively smaller amounts over the following weeks. Because 
of  this  phenomenon,  when  there  is  a  short-lived  spike  in  spot  prices,  retail  prices 
in the next week will typically reflect only part of the spike, while those in the next 
few succeeding weeks will continue to reflect part of the initial spot increase, while 
also  beginning  to  reflect  the  subsequent  decrease.  Thus,  even  if  the  speed  of  pass- 
through from spot to retail is exactly the same in the upward and downward direc-
tions, the retail price path will appear asymmetrical. 

If  we  look  at  the  actual  pattern  of  prices  seen  to  date  following  Hurricane 
Katrina, we find that retail gasoline prices both rose and fell somewhat more quick-
ly  than  suggested  by  the  typical  gasoline  price  pass-through  pattern  described 
above,  and  peaked  at  a  higher  level.  While  we  have  not  reached  any  conclusions 
about  the  reason  for  this  (and  we  are  unlikely  to  ever  know  the  answer  with  any 
certainty), there are a few aspects of the situation following Hurricane Katrina that 
may  explain  this  pattern.  One  is  that  under  typical  market  conditions  (as  reflected 
in  our  modeling  from  historical  data),  the  spot  price  increase  seen  in  a  given  week 
seldom  exceeds  10  cents  per  gallon,  whereas  average  spot  prices  following  Katrina 
rose  by  nearly  95  cents  in  5  calendar  days  (only  3  trading  days).  While  marketers 
might delay somewhat in passing on a single-digit increase, thus absorbing some of 
the  impact  by  reducing  their  profit  margins,  an  increase,  such  as  that  seen  after 
the  storm,  goes  well  beyond  profits  and  would  require  marketers  to  raise  retail 
prices  by  virtually  the  full  amount  of  their  wholesale  increase  merely  to  avoid  siz-
able losses. Second, independent marketers, who often represent some of the lowest 
retail prices in the marketplace, were likely to have been disproportionately affected 
by the supply shortfall, since they typically do not have as much security of supply 
as  branded  marketers.  The  removal  or  lessening  of  this  downward  pull  on  retail 
prices could have had some impact on the speed of price changes, both upward and 
downward, following Hurricane Katrina. 

The changes in crude oil and gasoline prices since Hurricane Katrina are reflected 
in  the  change  in  the  relative  shares  of  the  various  components  of  retail  gasoline 
prices. In the month of July, crude oil made up about 55 percent of the U.S. average 
price  of  a  gallon  of  regular  gasoline,  while  refining  costs  and  profits  represented 
about  18  percent,  distribution  and  marketing  8  percent,  and  taxes  19  percent.  As 
of September 19, those percentages were approximately: crude oil, 52 percent; refin-
ing, 24 percent; distribution and marketing, 8 percent; and taxes, 16 percent. Of the 
current  price  composition,  only  the  distribution  and  marketing  component  is  un-
usual.  Due  to  the  lag  in  price  pass-through,  this  component  is  larger  as  prices  are 
falling, but once prices stabilize, will likely return to a more typical share. 

The near-term outlook for oil markets will depend on a number of factors, includ-
ing  the  timing  and  pace  of  the  recovery  of  the  petroleum  infrastructure  and  oper-
ations  in  the  Gulf.  The  rate  at  which  refinery  capacity  affected  by  Katrina  can  be 
brought  back  on-line  is  the  major  factor  affecting  petroleum  product  markets.  Al-
though  full  damage  assessments  for  the  four  refineries  remaining  shut  down  have 
not  yet  been  possible,  early  estimates  indicate  that  several  of  them  may  be  down 
for months. 

Even  if  the  energy  system  is  fully  or  near  fully  restored  by  December,  prices  for 
all  petroleum  products  are  likely  to  remain  elevated.  On  September  7,  we  released 
our  monthly  Short-Term  Energy  Outlook.  For  this  Outlook,  we  considered  three 
cases based on the speed of recovery of the energy system from the effects of Hurri-
cane Katrina—Slow, Medium, and Fast Recovery Cases. The Fast Recovery Case as-
sumes  a  very  favorable  set  of  circumstances  for  returning  operations  to  normal, 
while  the  Slow  Recovery  Case  assumes  that  significant  impacts  on  oil  and  natural 
gas  production  and  delivery  continue  at  least  into  November.  In  all  cases,  normal 
operations are achieved or nearly achieved by December. 

The  Outlook  assumes  that  the  loans  and  releases  of  crude  oil  and  products  from 
U.S. and other government stocks will help to offset price increases due to Katrina. 
The WTI crude oil price averaged $65 per barrel in August. In the Medium Recovery 
Case,  we  estimate  that  the  WTI  will  average  nearly  $70  per  barrel  for  September, 
and  about  $65  per  barrel  for  the  third  quarter  of  2005,  which  is  about  $20  above 
the  year-ago  level  and  $5  higher  than  in  the  previous  Outlook.  We  estimate  that 
quarterly average prices will remain above $62 per barrel through 2006. 

The  national  average  price  of  unleaded  regular  gasoline  was  $2.49  per  gallon  in 
August,  with  prices  generally  rising  throughout  the  month  well  before  Katrina  im-
pacted refining and production activities—right before Katrina hit, the national av-
erage  price  for  regular  gasoline  was  $2.61.  Projected  gasoline  prices  in  the  near-

130 

term are very sensitive to assumptions regarding the pace of recovery from refinery 
outages  caused  by  Katrina.  In  the  Medium  Recovery  Case  in  our  new  Outlook,  the 
September average price for unleaded regular is $2.96 per gallon, with prices rough-
ly  20  cents  per  gallon  lower  or  higher  in  the  Fast  and  Slow  Recovery  Cases.  Prices 
are generally expected to decrease in the fourth quarter, with the monthly national 
average  in  the  Medium  Recovery  Case  falling  to  $2.71  per  gallon  in  October,  $2.56 
in  November,  and  $2.47  in  December.  The  third-quarter  average  price  is  $0.69  per 
gallon  higher  than  in  the  third  quarter  of  2004.  The  band  of  projections  for  the  al-
ternative  recovery  cases  narrows  over  time.  Looking  ahead  to  2006,  the  projected 
average price is $2.40 per gallon. 

This concludes my statement, Mr. Chairman, and I will be happy to answer your 

questions. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  We  find  that  energy  outlook  very  helpful,  so  we 

appreciate that.

The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Kosh? 

STATEMENT OF RONALD W. KOSH, VICE PRESIDENT, 

PUBLIC POLICY AND GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS, 

AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION (AAA) MID-ATLANTIC 
Mr.  KOSH.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Inouye,  Senator 
Lautenberg, Senator Pryor. Good afternoon. I’m Ronald Kosh, Vice 
President  of  Public  and  Government  Affairs  at  AAA  Mid-Atlantic, 
part  of  the  AAA  Federation  of  Auto  Clubs.  Thank  you  for  the  op-
portunity to address the critical issues of gas prices. 

Before  addressing  my  club’s  local  experience  in  our  five-state 
service  area,  I’d  like  to  speak  on  behalf  of  our  national  AAA  Fed-
eration, with over 48 million members across the country. 

AAA has several recommendations we think would ease this and 
future  gas  crises.  These  recommendations  include  that  oil  compa-
nies  ensure  their  pricing  yields  the  type  of  reasonable  profit  they 
need,  and  that  their  stockholders  deserve,  but  not  an  excessive 
amount. Federal authorities need to relax requirements for blended 
fuels  and  release  crude  oil  from  the  Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve, 
which  we  applaud  that  they  have.  Those  need  to  be  continued. 
Local and state authorities must be especially vigilant with regard 
to any retail pricing abuses that have occurred. And motorists must 
reduce  consumption  by  using  the  most  fuel-efficient  cars,  avoiding 
wasted trips, maintaining their vehicles, and carpooling, when pos-
sible.  All  of  us  must  avoid  the  impulse  to  hoard  gas  or  constantly 
top  off  our  tanks.  Even  in  the  best  of  times,  with  the  refinery  ca-
pacity  strained  as  it  is,  there  is  seldom  enough  fuel  in  the  system 
to fill every car and truck vehicle to the top of their tank. And the 
media  must  carefully  and  responsibly  cover  the  situation.  Over-re-
porting random shortages or an incidental supply interruption, pro-
voke panic buying and hoarding, and that only makes the situation 
worse. 

Doing all of these things will not serve our problem in the short- 

term, but it’ll help mitigate it. 

Taking a longer view, Congress needs to ensure adequate domes-
tic refinery capacity, and require EPA to modify its mile-per-gallon 
testing  procedures  to  reflect  real-world  driving  conditions,  so  mo-
torists have a more accurate reading of the fuel mileage that their 
vehicles  will  achieve  on  today’s  roads.  And  we  must  address  the 
Federal  gasoline  standards  that  currently  result  in  a  patchwork  of

131 

multiple  blends  that  puts  additional  strains  on  our  already  inad-
equate domestic refining capacity. 

Now  I’d  like  to  turn  to  my  own  club’s  regional  experience.  AAA 
Mid-Atlantic serves 3.6 million members from northern New Jersey 
to  southern  Virginia.  We  serve  Maryland,  New  Jersey,  Pennsyl-
vania, Delaware, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. 

Through AAA’s Daily Fuel Gauge Report, AAA has been tracking 
fuel prices on a daily basis since 1974. In the weeks following Hur-
ricane  Katrina,  gas  prices  in  our  service  area,  in  the  entire  Mid- 
Atlantic  region,  and  specifically  in  the  District  and  in  the  states 
that  I’ve  mentioned,  especially  Delaware,  New  Jersey,  and  Mary-
land,  have  been  some  of  the  very  highest  in  the  country,  with  in-
dustry explanations woefully inadequate. 

Concerns  about  gouging  were  raised  when  retail  prices  climbed, 
almost  hourly.  They  were  especially  heightened  in  Virginia  on  the 
Labor Day weekend. That Friday afternoon, locally, a Shell station 
in  Centreville,  started  charging  $6  a  gallon  for  gas.  Virginia  offi-
cials are investigating that. 

Here  in  the  District  of  Columbia,  gas  prices  have  continuously 
been  among  the  highest  in  the  Nation.  In  Maryland,  next  door, 
prices recently rose, as late as Friday, to the second-highest in the 
Nation.  And  they’ve  been  similarly  high  in  Delaware  and  in  New 
Jersey. And in each of these jurisdictions, we’ve heard industry ex-
planations  that  don’t  measure  up.  And,  in  some  cases,  they’re  al-
most comically contradictory. 

At a hearing before the Maryland House Committee on Economic 
Matters  in  that  State’s  General  Assembly,  an  industry  representa-
tive  told  legislators  that  the  reason  Maryland  had  some  of  the 
highest prices in the Nation was because of its location on the pipe-
line, and it was heavily dependent on that pipeline. Well, the state 
hadn’t  moved  since  prior  to  the  incident.  They  also  said  that  gas 
was  more  expensive  in  Maryland  because  it  had  no  refineries  and 
received little, if any, fuel by ship. 

The  following  day,  in  Wilmington,  the  Delaware  News  Journal 
quoted  oil  company  officials  there  as  saying  the  reason  local  gas 
prices  were  near  highest  in  the  Nation  was  because  Delaware,  a 
state  with  its  own  refineries,  was  served  mostly  by  tankers  and 
barges and didn’t get any of its fuel from pipelines. 

Then  in  Maryland,  after  a  meeting  with  the  Governor,  oil  com-
pany representatives assured reporters that the price was demand- 
driven. That happened almost simultaneously with the Department 
of Energy reporting that demand was down. 

It is those kind of non-answers and contradictory comments that 
cause  your  constituents  alarm  and  the  public  to  believe  that  a 
smokescreen  is  the  real  answer.  All  the  while,  the  industry  is  re-
porting  record  profits.  The  reaction  is  that  a  natural  disaster  is 
merely  an  excuse.  We  hope  that’s  not  the  case.  But,  absent  viable 
and  believable  explanations  yet  to  be  proffered,  it  might  be  the 
case, and, if that’s so, it’s unconscionable. 

We  recognize  that  gasoline  is  a  commodity  product  and  that  it’s 
market-driven.  Does  it  really  cost  substantially  more,  though,  to 
get gas to the Mid-Atlantic region? And do motorists here use more 
gas, have a higher demand than motorists elsewhere? Our demand,

as  the  largest  travel  agency  in  the  Mid-Atlantic  region,  suggests 
otherwise,  and  we  don’t  believe  that  answer  buys  any  credibility. 
Could Maryland, with the second-highest prices in the Nation at 
the  time,  possibly  have  a  demand  that  exceeds  that  of  California, 
Pennsylvania, or Ohio? I don’t think so. Yet this region has persist-
ently, during this crisis, had some of the most expensive gas in the 
Nation, while, in fact, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey are 
in  a  region  with  a  particularly  high  concentration  of  its  own  refin-
eries. 

Last  week,  when  gas  prices  fell  below  $3  a  gallon  in  30  states, 
Washington,  D.C.,  Maryland,  Virginia,  Delaware,  Pennsylvania, 
and  New  Jersey  posted  gas  at  the  $3  mark  and  above.  And,  while 
there  are  multiple  local  refineries—for  example,  New  Jersey  has 
many  of  its  own,  and  it  also  has  some  of  the  lowest  gas  taxes  in 
the  country,  another  component  of  pricing  that  has  been  over-
looked. 

While we recognize the potential for some unscrupulous types to 
try  to  take  advantage  of  crisis  situations,  our  view  is  that  such 
practices  are  certainly  unwarranted,  unconscionable,  and  should 
not be tolerated. In the wake of such episodes, we warned motorists 
to report any incidents of price-gouging, and we advised consumers 
to shop with their steering wheel. Moreover, we’ve been urging law-
makers at all levels to address such complaints, and do so with dis-
patch.  We’ve  also  urged  investigations  and  are  working  with  indi-
viduals  in  the  various  states  we  serve  and  their  state’s  attorneys 
general offices. 

We’re  going  to  continue  our  efforts  to  assist  those  officials  in 
their  quest  for  an  accurate  answer,  why  our  region  has  been  the 
highest in the Nation, and why, with often lower gas prices, they’re 
still higher than their neighbors. 

We thank you for beginning the investigation into gas prices. We 
believe that scrutiny by this Committee, by Congress, and by state 
legislatures will be part of the solution. We also believe that taking 
advantage of motorists in a time of national emergencies should be 
illegal, and applaud your efforts to address it. 

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity,  and  I’ll—as  I  see  the  red  light’s 

on, you can enter my full remarks in the record. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Kosh follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RONALD W. KOSH, VICE PRESIDENT, PUBLIC AND 

GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS, AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION (AAA) MID-ATLANTIC 
Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee: 
Good  afternoon,  I’m  Ronald  W.  Kosh,  Vice  President  for  Public  and  Government 
Affairs  at  AAA  Mid-Atlantic,  part  of  the  AAA  federation  of  auto  clubs.  Thank  you 
for  the  opportunity  to  address  the  critical  issue  of  gas  prices.  Almost  nothing  hits 
home harder with AAA members than gas prices—especially the extremely high gas 
prices we’re seeing now. But before addressing my club’s experience in our territory, 
I want to speak on behalf of our AAA federation with over 48 million members. 

Our  federation  has  several  recommendations  that  we  think  would  ease  this  and 

future gas crises. Those recommendations include: 

• Oil  companies  must  ensure  that  their  pricing  yields  what  they  need  and  de-

serve, but not more. 

• Federal  authorities  needed  to  relax  requirements  for  blended  fuels  and  release 

crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We applaud that they have.

133 

• Local  authorities  must  be  vigilant  with  regard  to  any  retail  pricing  abuses 
which  may  occur.  Also,  they  must  be  prepared  to  institute  fuel  purchase  man-
agement programs if the need arises. 
• Motorists must reduce consumption by using their most fuel-efficient car, avoid-
ing  unnecessary  trips,  maintaining  their  vehicle,  driving  ‘‘gently’’  and  car-pool-
ing whenever possible. 
We should also avoid the impulse to hoard gas or constantly top off tanks. Even 
in the best of times there is not enough fuel in the system to fill every car and 
truck to the top of their fuel gauge. 
• The media must carefully cover the situation. Over-reporting a limited number 
of  shortages  may  provoke  panic  buying  or  hoarding,  and  that  will  only  make 
the situation worse. 

Doing all of these things will not solve our short-term problems, but can help miti-
gate  their  impact.  Taking  a  longer  view,  Congress  needs  to  require  EPA  to  modify 
its  MPG  testing  procedures  to  accurately  reflect  real-world  driving  conditions,  so 
motorists  can  have  a  more  accurate  reading  of  the  fuel  mileage  their  vehicle  will 
achieve on today’s roads. And, we must address the Federal standard for clean gaso-
line that currently results in a patchwork of fuel blends that puts additional strains 
on our already strained refining capacity. 
The AAA Mid-Atlantic Experience 

Now,  I  would  like  to  turn  to  my  own  club’s  experience.  AAA  Mid-Atlantic  serves 
3.6  million  members  in  Delaware,  Maryland,  New  Jersey,  Pennsylvania,  Virginia 
and the District of Columbia. Through AAA’s Daily Fuel Gauge Report our club has 
tracked fuel prices daily since 1974. 

In  the  weeks  following  Hurricane  Katrina,  gasoline  prices  in  our  territory—spe-
cifically, in D.C., Delaware and Maryland have been some of the very highest in the 
Nation, with industry explanations woefully inadequate. Absent a satisfactory expla-
nation, motorists are left with few answers outside of excess profit-taking. 

Concerns  about  price-gouging  were  raised  and  heightened  in  Virginia  on  Labor 
Day weekend. That Friday afternoon, a Shell station in Centreville, started charging 
nearly  $6  for  a  gallon  of  gas.  Virginia  officials  are  now  investigating  that  gas  sta-
tion. 

In  the  District  of  Columbia,  gas  prices  for  many  days  have  been  the  most  expen-
sive in the Nation. In Maryland, prices recently rose to second highest in the nation, 
and in Delaware they were as high as third in the Nation. In each of these jurisdic-
tions,  we  have  heard  the  industry’s  explanations  and  they  don’t  measure  up,  and 
in some instances appear contradictory. 

• At  a  hearing  before  the  Maryland  House  Committee  on  Economic  Matters,  an 
industry  representative  told  legislators  that  the  reason  Maryland  had  some  of 
the  highest  prices  in  the  Nation  was  because  of  its  location  on  the  pipeline. 
They  also  said  that  gas  was  more  expensive  in  Maryland  because  it  has  no  re-
fineries  and  got  very  little  petroleum  in  by  ship  or  barge  and  was  so  heavily 
dependent on the pipeline. 
• In Wilmington, the Delaware News Journal quoted oil company officials as say-
ing  the  reason  that  Delaware’s  gas  prices  were  near  the  highest  in  the  Nation 
was  because  the  state  had  refineries  and  was  served  mostly  by  tankers/barges 
and did not get its petroleum from the pipeline. 
• In  Maryland,  after  a  meeting  with  the  Governor,  oil  company  representatives 

assured reporters that the prices were demand-driven. 

It  is  these  kinds  of  non-answers  and  contradictory  comments  that  cause  us  con-
cern, and cause us to believe that they may be a smoke screen for the real answer: 
the industry is making huge profits on the backs of motorists in these states, using 
a  national  disaster  in  the  Gulf  as  an  excuse.  We  hope  that  is  not  the  case,  but  ab-
sent  viable  explanations  yet  to  be  proffered  by  the  industry;  we  are  left  with  this 
troubling possibility. If true, it is unconscionable and should be illegal. 

Does  it  cost  the  companies  any  more  to  get  gas  to  the  mid-Atlantic  region?  No. 
Do  motorists  here  use  more  gas—i.e.,  have  a  higher  demand  than  motorists  else-
where? No. Could Maryland with the second highest prices in the Nation at the time 
possibly  have  a  demand  that  exceeds  that  of  California,  Pennsylvania,  Ohio?  Of 
course not. Yet this region has persistently, during this crisis, had some of the most 
expensive gas in the Nation. 

Last  week  when  gasoline  prices  fell  below  $3.00  per  gallon  in  30  states,  Wash-
ington,  D.C.,  Maryland,  Virginia,  Delaware,  Pennsylvania,  and  New  Jersey  posted 
gas at the three-dollar mark and above.

AAA Mid-Atlantic recognizes the potential for some unscrupulous owners and ven-
dors  to  try  to  take  advantage  of  crisis  situations  to  make  a  bigger  profit.  In  our 
view,  such  practices  should  be  illegal,  and  are  certainly  unwarranted,  and  uncon-
scionable. They should not be tolerated. 

In  the  wake  of  such  episodes,  we  warned  motorists  to  watch  for  and  report  any 
incidents  of  price-gouging.  We  also  advised  consumers  to  avoid  those  gasoline  sta-
tions by shopping with their steering wheel. 

Moreover,  we  have  urged  state  and  local  officials  in  our  territory  to  investigate 
such complaints. We have also urged investigations in and are working with officials 
in D.C., Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, including, legislators and the state’s At-
torneys General offices. 

AAA  Mid-Atlantic  is  actively  monitoring  the  situation  in  our  region  and  will  con-
tinue  its  efforts  to  assist  officials  there  in  their  quest  for  the  truth  about  why  gas, 
particularly  in  D.C.,  Maryland,  and  Delaware  has  been  the  highest  or  near  highest 
in  the  nation,  when  their  neighbors,  who  draw  their  gas,  often  from  the  same 
sources, are much lower. 

We  thank  you  for  investigating  gas  prices,  because  we  believe  scrutiny—by  Con-
gress,  by  state  legislators  and  state’s  attorneys  general  will  be  part  of  the  solution. 
We  also  believe  that  taking  advantage  of  motorists  with  outrageous  profit  making 
in a time of national emergencies should be illegal and applaud your efforts to make 
it a crime. 

Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today. 

The CHAIRMAN. Well, thank you very much. What shall we say— 
we  don’t  have  as  many  people—shall  we  say  6  minutes  apiece,  to 
start with? I don’t know who’s coming in. All right? 

Mr. Slaughter, what’s your answer to Mr. Kosh? Why is the Mid- 
Atlantic  singled  out?  Do  they  have  different  salary  levels?  Do  they 
have different transportation problems? Why should the Mid-Atlan-
tic region have a different price structure? 

Mr.  SLAUGHTER.  I  really  don’t  know  why  they  would  have  a  dif-
ferent  price  structure,  Senator.  I  live  here,  as  well,  and  purchase 
gasoline  in  the  area.  The—you  know,  Maryland  does  not  have  re-
fineries. There are refineries in New Jersey, which Mr. Kosh men-
tioned. It is more or less near the end of the Colonial Pipeline sys-
tem, but, you know, the fact of the matter is, Senator, that the de-
cisions that are made at the retail level in the gasoline service sta-
tions  are  made  by  independent  businessmen  and  businesswomen. 
There are about 168,000 service stations in the United States, and 
only  about  10  percent  of  them  are  owned  and  operated  by  refining 
companies.  The  rest  are—basically,  product  is  sold  for  resale  by 
independent  businesspeople  who  make  their  own  decisions.  And, 
you  know,  I  think  we’ve  seen,  since  the—since  Katrina—and  cer-
tainly  it  has  been  stated  today—there  is  pervasive  attention  being 
given  to  pricing  of  gasoline  all  over  the  United  States.  There  are 
gouging hotlines that have been set up. I have been testifying now 
at three hearings, at which this has been a major concern of Mem-
bers  of  Congress  who  are  questioning.  The  FTC,  this  morning,  ex-
plained  their  price-monitoring  project  in  360  American  cities  that 
was  set  up  before  Katrina  and  has  been  continuing.  So,  you  know, 
I  think  there’s  going  to  be  a  great  deal  of  scrutiny  given  to  this 
practice.  We  believe  that  the  market  pricing  system  we  have  has 
been  dealing  with  a  very  difficult  supply  situation  caused  by 
Katrina. It had a major impact on the energy infrastructure of the 
country.  Five  percent  of  our  refining  capacity  is  not  yet  back  up. 
A  significant  amount,  60  percent,  of  our  crude  production  capacity 
in the Gulf is still not functioning. So, there still are major outages 
that  are  occurring.  And—again,  as  Mr.  Caruso  referred  to,  the 
magnitude  of  what  has  happened  to  the  system;  but  if  there  are

row. 

anomalies,  there  are  people  who  are  looking  at  every  allegation  of 
inappropriate pricing, and there’s every reason to believe that that 
will  continue.  And,  indeed,  the  recent  energy  bill  has  a  require-
ment,  as  was  mentioned  today,  for  the  FTC  to  look  at  allegations 
such as these. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Mr.  Kosh,  if  it’s  any  consolation  to  you,  I  go  back  and  forth  to 
Alaska  quite  a  bit.  The  price  in  the  District  of  Columbia  is  pretty 
high,  but  it’s  always  higher  in  Anchorage,  and  we  produce  the  oil. 
So, you know—— 

Mr.  KOSH.  Well,  you  should  be  back  there  yesterday,  Mr.  Sen-
ator.  In  Alaska’s  average  data,  it  was  $2.80.  So,  it  was  actually 
pretty favorable pricing. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  It’s  coming  down,  good.  I’m  going  home  tomor-

[Laughter.] 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Slocum, this morning we had testimony that 
indicated  that  the  price  in  Europe  is  very  high,  probably—it  ex-
ceeds  $7  a  gallon,  and  that  the  net  result  of  that  is  smaller  cars, 
greater gas mileage and greater conservation. I like low prices, too, 
but  should  we  look  at  price  as  being  a  disincentive  to  increasing 
demand? 

Mr.  SLOCUM.  Sure,  but  I’m  not  sure  that  the  ends  justify  the 
means. Europe has much higher gasoline prices because their level 
of taxation on gasoline products is—— 

The CHAIRMAN. Well, that’s a disincentive. 
Mr. SLOCUM.—significantly higher. 
The CHAIRMAN. That’s a disincentive. 
Mr.  SLOCUM.  And  I  think  that  there’s  no  question  that  one  key 
to  sustained  economic  growth  in  the  United  States  throughout  the 
20th  century  was  sustained  levels  of  very  reasonably-priced  fuel 
and other energy products. It has been a key to continued U.S. eco-
nomic  development.  And  Public  Citizen  is—we  are  a  consumer  ad-
vocacy group. We understand that there are some benefits to high-
er prices, but not when it comes at the expense of consumers, par-
ticularly middle- and lower-income consumers, who are going to be 
hit the hardest. And when you combine rising gasoline prices with 
the  upcoming  crisis  in  natural  gas  for  this  Winter,  you’re  going  to 
have millions of Americans who literally are going to be making de-
cisions  this  Winter  whether  they’re  going  to  buy  food,  whether 
they’re  going  to  pay  their  rent  or  their  mortgage,  or  whether 
they’re going to pay their utility bill. Congress needs to understand 
that  there  is  going  to  be  a  major  financial  crisis  this  winter,  when 
you  combine  rising  gasoline  and  other  energy  prices  and  natural 
gas prices. It is going to be an epidemic. And until we start dealing 
with  it  by  examining  uncompetitive  practices  in  the  industry,  I 
think  that  we  are  setting  ourselves  up  for  a  serious  economic 
shock. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Has  Public  Citizen  supported  increasing  oil  sup-

plies, such as drilling offshore or exploring for oil in my state? 

Mr. SLOCUM. Well, considering that the United States is already 
the third-largest producer of crude oil in the world, I’m not so sure 
that  increasing  crude  oil  production  is  going  to  get  us  out  of  this 
jam.

The CHAIRMAN. I don’t think—— 
Mr. SLOCUM. I would much—— 
The CHAIRMAN.—I don’t think your figure is accurate. 
Mr. SLOCUM. Well, the—my figures come from the Energy Infor-

mation Administration. 

The CHAIRMAN. Is that right, Mr. Caruso? We’re the third-largest 

producer of crude in the world? 

Mr. CARUSO. That’s accurate. They are Saudi Arabia, Russia, and 

the United States, in that order. Yes, sir. 

Mr.  SLOCUM.  The  problem  is,  is  that  we  are,  far  and  away,  the 
largest  consumer  of  oil.  We  use  25  percent  of  the  world’s  oil  every 
day.  So,  until  you  deal  with  demand,  which—rising  prices,  sure, 
that’s going to—— 

The CHAIRMAN. You didn’t answer my question. Did you support 

additional supplies, or not? 

Mr.  SLOCUM.  No,  I  did  not  support  it,  because  I  don’t  think  that 
increasing  supplies  of  crude  is  the  long-term  answer,  Mr.  Chair-
man. 

The CHAIRMAN. I see. 
Mr. Kosh, what would you suggest we do about the Mid-Atlantic? 

This is my last question. 

Mr. KOSH. Well, as of—the numbers I mentioned earlier were as 
of the end of last Friday—as of yesterday, they dropped somewhat, 
although—and  now  the  Pacific  Coast  is  the  highest  price—highest 
region in the country. 

One of the things that we have—we’ve asked for—and—is to pro-
vide  additional  capacity—and,  in  fact,  if  you  watched  the  markets 
last  week,  the  exchanges,  they  were  talking  about  the  prospect  of 
glut,  come  October.  Now,  Rita  has  changed  that,  as  of  this  week. 
The  prices  have  been  ratcheting  around,  and  they’ve  taken  a  sud-
den spike upwards. 

One  of  the  things  that  we  have  been  watching,  too,  was  the 
spread  between  the  wholesale  price  and  the  retail  price.  Once  the 
entire  situation  unfolded,  that  spread  widened.  It  widened.  Not 
only  did  the  wholesale  price  dramatically  increase,  there  also 
seemed  to  be  a  significant  spread  at  the  retail  level,  as  well.  And 
our—we  have  not  been  able  to  see  what  the  justification  for  that 
was, either. 

The CHAIRMAN. Senator Inouye? 

STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

Senator INOUYE. Thank you. 
We’ve  been  told,  all  day  long,  that  the  supply  is  insufficient,  the 
demand is constant. And then others would say that that’s the situ-
ation  because  we  don’t  have  enough  refineries.  And  I  note  that,  in 
1981, there were 324 refineries; 2002, there were 153. And yet your 
profit margin, Mr. Slaughter, according to the record, is the highest 
ever in your history. Why is the number down? Why aren’t—— 

Mr. SLAUGHTER. The number—— 
Senator INOUYE.—why aren’t they building more refineries? 
Mr.  SLAUGHTER.  There  are  about  149  refineries  now,  Senator 
Inouye.  There  has  been  considerable  investment  in  refining  over 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  15:23 May 10, 2011 Jkt 066218 PO 00000 Frm 00140 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\66218.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

the  last  20  years.  For  example,  between  1985  and  1995,  a  million 
barrels was added. 

Senator INOUYE. Is your profit margin too low to justify building 

other refineries? 

Mr.  SLAUGHTER.  Yes—well,  sir  that  was  the  case,  for  a  signifi-
cant period. Before 2003, 2004, and 2005, the return-on-investment 
in  the  refining  industry  was  5  percent  or  lower,  which,  basically, 
was  a  very,  very  low  return-on-investment.  And  the  industry  was 
also  saddled  with  extremely  large  investment  requirements  for  en-
vironmental  programs,  which  were  good  programs,  but  it  was  not 
a  part  of  the  industry  that  you  went  into  to  make  a  significant 
amount of money, or, really, any money at all, in several years. The 
exploration  and  production  part  of  the  business,  for  instance,  had 
much higher returns than refining. 

Nevertheless,  refiners  did  invest  money  in  the  plants  at  those 
times,  and  did  make  slight  increases  in  capacity.  As  I  said,  we 
added  a  million  barrels  of  capacity  in  that  10  years,  even  under 
bad  profit  conditions.  That’s  the  equivalent,  sir,  of  adding  several 
large refineries in the U.S., except this capacity was added at exist-
ing sites. 

We  think—we  hope  that,  with  the  better  returns  that  you’ve 
mentioned  in  the  last  couple  of  years,  that  there  will  be  increased 
refining  investment  this  year  and  in  the  years  to  come,  because 
people  will  see  better  returns  coming  from  that  investment  than 
we’ve seen in the last 15 years before. 

Senator INOUYE. Is the profit margin sufficient now? 
Mr.  SLAUGHTER.  Well,  judging  from  the  anecdotal  evidence  we 
have,  where  people  are  announcing  increases  in  refining  capacity 
at  existing  facilities  in  the  United  States—and  there  are  rumors 
that additional capacity increases will be announced—it looks as if 
it’s  getting  to  be  that  way,  yes,  sir,  that  we’re  out  of  that  10-year 
period in which there was insufficient return to justify investment. 
But  investors  are  still  going  to  have  to  ask  themselves  whether— 
these are long-lived assets—whether the 10 years to come are going 
to  be  more  like  the  bad  10  years  or  more  like  the  last  two.  But  I 
think  the  answer  is  that  more  will  say  there  are  going  to  be  more 
years  like  the  last  two,  and,  therefore,  there  will  be  more  invest-
ment and refining. 

The CHAIRMAN. Would you let me interrupt just a minute? 
Senator INOUYE. Sure. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Could  you  give  us  a  summary  of  the  rec-

ommendations you’ve made in all those reports? 

Mr. SLAUGHTER. Yes, I’d be glad to. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Senator  INOUYE.  Mr.  Kosh,  you’ve  described  the  price  hikes  as 
unconscionable  and  unacceptable.  You  have  also  issued  a  press  re-
leased,  on  September  9,  in  which  you  suggested,  from  reports  you 
received  from  dealers,  that  big  companies  were  dictating  price 
hikes. Are you suggesting that there has been price-gouging? 

Mr.  KOSH.  Well,  I  think  the  word  ‘‘gouging’’  means  different 
things  to  different  people.  There  have  been  incidents  that  we’ve 
been  aware  of,  as  recently  as  over  the  weekend,  reported  in  the 
Philadelphia  Inquirer,  for  example,  where  there  were  dealers  who 
had distribution contracts with certain producers that actually cov-

ered  their—those  producers’  brands  up  and  were  buying  off  the 
wholesale market, un-branded product and selling it there, because 
they  were  being  charged  a  price  that  didn’t  allow  them  to  meet 
those  other  prices  that  were  in  the  market  and  make  a  sufficient 
margin.  There  were  not—it  appears,  as  I  mentioned,  based  on  my 
earlier  comment,  between  that  spread  at  the  retail—wholesale/re-
tail, but there are also all sorts of indications, even before Rita be-
came  a  member  of  the  current  scene,  we  were  starting  to  see  allo-
cations,  that  some  of  the  producing  companies  were  imposing  allo-
cations upon their distributors. 

So, I think it bears scrutiny at all levels, Senator. 
Senator INOUYE. Beyond scrutiny, what do you suggest? 
Mr.  KOSH.  Well,  I  made  some  recommendations  earlier,  and  I’d 

be happy to provide those, in a written standpoint. 

Senator  INOUYE.  Are  you  suggesting  that  what  has  transpired 

may constitute illegal action? 

Mr. KOSH. Well, I think we heard earlier as to—the debate as to 
what  is  illegal  under  current  antitrust  and  those,  whether  there 
are sufficient laws there. I think that’s where the—I think, for your 
body,  and  the  Members  of  the  House  on  the  other  side,  to  deter-
mine that. 

Senator INOUYE. Would you suggest that it constitutes conspiracy 

or collusion? 

Mr.  KOSH.  Well,  we’re  not  going  that  far.  We  don’t  have  any  in-

formation to suggest that’s the case. 

Senator  INOUYE.  Mr.  Caruso,  now,  with  Rita,  what  sort  of  gas 

price am I going to be paying? 

Mr.  CARUSO.  Well,  that’s  very  difficult  to  say,  of  course,  without 
knowing  where  Rita  will  make  landfall.  But,  clearly,  the  parts  of 
Texas, where Rita now is headed, actually have larger refinery ca-
pacity  than  those  refineries  that  Katrina  affected.  So,  there’s— 
again,  this  is  pure  speculation—there’s  a  risk  that  we  could  have 
a  substantial  impact  on  additional  refineries.  So,  again,  depending 
on  where  it  makes  landfall,  it  certainly  could  impact  gasoline  sup-
plies. And, as several people have mentioned already, we’re already 
in an extremely tight situation, so we clearly cannot afford any fur-
ther disruption in gasoline production capability. 

Senator INOUYE. What percentage of the refinery capacity was af-

fected by Katrina? 

Mr.  CARUSO.  Initially,  about  two  million  barrels  a  day,  which  is 
about—a little more than 10 percent. Now, there are four refineries 
still out of service, and they constitute about 900,000 barrels a day, 
which  is  about  5  percent  of  the  total  refining  capacity.  And  they 
make  about  4  percent  of  our  gasoline  production  in  this  country, 
those four refineries. 

Senator INOUYE. And that production, do you believe, constitutes 

a justifiable reason for these price hikes? 

Mr.  CARUSO.  Well,  there’s—it’s  far  more  complicated  than  just 
those four refineries. There were two major product pipelines—Co-
lonial  and  Plantation—which  serve  much  of  the  Southeast  and 
much  of  Mid-Atlantic,  including  Maryland  and  D.C.,  so  that  the 
highest  price  impacts  were—you  could  almost  map  it  out—they 
were  along  those  two  pipelines.  There  may  have  been  specific  in-
stances, which Mr. Kosh refers to, which I’m not familiar with. We

139 

collect data on a regional basis, as we do for most states. But most 
of  the  largest  impact  took  place  along  those  two  pipelines,  but,  be-
cause we have a national market for wholesale and retail gasoline, 
gasoline prices spread quickly. Even states that had no effect from 
Colonial,  or  Plantation,  suffered  from  the  economic  cost  of  the  ris-
ing  market.  In  fact,  there  were  rises  in  the  price  of  gasoline  on  a 
global market. So, that’s part of the answer—it’s not the whole an-
swer—as to the question why can you be in an unaffected area and 
still have very high price increases, because of the fungibility of the 
product.  The  specific  instances,  I  couldn’t  comment  on,  because  I 
don’t have enough information about that. 

I think another point is that Mr. Slocum mentioned how we ben-
efited from many decades of low energy prices in this country, and 
it  clearly  had  a  lot  to  do  with  the  very  strong  economic  growth, 
even  in  the  1990s.  But  the  downside  that  has  been  mentioned  by 
Mr.  Slaughter,  among  others,  was  the  lack  of  investment  in  infra-
structure.  And  it  has  really  put  us  in  the  position  we’re  in  now, 
where  a  terrible  event  like  Katrina  devastated  an  infrastructure 
that  was  already  being  operated  so  close  to  full  capacity  that  it 
didn’t  take  a  lot.  And  when  you  get  a  catastrophe,  the—as  the 
economists  would  say—the  low  price  elasticity  of  gasoline,  in  par-
ticular,  means  small  changes  in  supply  or  demand  can  make  huge 
changes in price. 

Thank you. 
Senator INOUYE. I thank you very much. 
I notice my time is up. I’ll wait for my second—— 
The CHAIRMAN. Yes. 
Mr.  Slaughter,  how  much  refining  capacity  is  in  the  Galveston 

area? 

Mr.  SLAUGHTER.  Well,  there’s—about  25  percent  of  U.S.  refining 
capacity is in Texas Gulf of Mexico. And in the Houston area itself, 
you have about 10 percent. Significant facilities, I mean, including, 
you  know,  Baytown,  which  is  the  largest  refinery  in  the  United 
States, is in that area. There are a number of refineries in Corpus 
Christi and Galveston. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Mr. SLAUGHTER. The good news is that much of the area, though, 

is not below sea level. I mean, that may be a plus in this area. 

The CHAIRMAN. The bad news, it’s a Category 4. 
Mr. SLAUGHTER. Yes, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Lautenberg? 

STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr.  Slaughter,  you  deny  that  there  is  likely  to  be,  or  could  be, 
any  price-gouging  in  the  industry,  and  you  don’t  see  it  that  way. 
Could you give me a definition of ‘‘price-gouging’’? What constitutes 
price-gouging, as you see it? 

Mr. SLAUGHTER. I think you’ve raised a very good question, Sen-
ator Lautenberg, because it’s difficult to define. There is obviously, 
you  know,  some  kind  of  extreme  aberrant  pricing  behavior  that’s 
unjustified by any market forces. And, oftentimes, people—— 

Senator LAUTENBERG. How would you define it?

Mr. SLAUGHTER. People—I’m sorry? 
Senator LAUTENBERG. How would you—I mean, I hear—can it be 
described in price terms? Can it be described in the cost of—for en-
ergy  included  in  the  average  family  budget?  What  is—most  of  us 
think  of  oil  as  a—fuel  as  a  commodity.  Most  commodities  wind  up 
being regulated if they’re determined to be necessary for life—qual-
ity of life. I mean, we see it with the electricity in States that typi-
cally have controls on the pricing. And I’m not advocating, I’m just 
curious about—I can tell you this, that when I talk to constituents 
or  people  I  know  who  are  ordinary  working  folk,  and  they  say 
they’re being gouged. Now, to them it’s a price gouge if it consumes 
a  significantly  larger  part  of  their  income  than  it  used  to.  And  I 
just  wondered  what  the  industry—because  if  you  deny  that  it’s 
being done, then there must be a definition of what ‘‘gouging’’ con-
stitutes. 

Mr.  SLAUGHTER.  The  difficulty,  Senator,  is  that  it  means  dif-
ferent  things  to  different  people.  And  the  problem  is  that  if  you 
tried  to  regulate  it,  you  can  end  up  with  price—what  are  essen-
tially  price  controls.  You  deem  what  is  an  acceptable  return  or  an 
acceptable price and what is not, and we’re back into the price-con-
trol situation that we were in, in the 1970s, for gasoline and diesel, 
crude oil, and also for natural gas—which didn’t work very well. 

So, the problem is, a lot of this is in the eye of the beholder, and 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Well,  now,  since  we  represent  beholders 

it’s difficult to define. 

here, it’s a—— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.—we  have  to,  kind  of,  find  out  what  the 
people who represent the industry think. And it—price-gouging can 
be  conspiratorial,  it  can  be  caused  by  the  price  of  crude,  can  be— 
there  are  lots  of  ways  that  you  can  get  inordinate  increases  in  the 
cost of the commodity, and it doesn’t necessarily constitute an ille-
gal  or  an  inappropriate  act.  And  I’m  just  wondering  at  what  point 
the industry thinks that—is it a profit margin? I used to run a very 
successful  company  before  I  came  here,  when  I  was  able  to  make 
a living, and the—our company had—our company had the—— 

The CHAIRMAN. Our sympathy. 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Sympathy?  I  know.  Thank  you,  Senator 

Stevens. I knew you would understand. The—— 

The CHAIRMAN. Just barely making a living. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  We  had  a  13  percent  return  on  revenues, 
after  tax  and—pretty  good-sized  company,  now  40,000  employees. 
What constitutes a good profit margin? You know, because we hear 
things  like,  ‘‘Well,  return  on  investment.’’  But  you  don’t  have  to 
have a huge return in order to make a ton of money if the market’s 
controlled, controlled by whatever factors. And it mystifies me, hon-
estly,  to  try  to  understand  how  it  happened  that  gasoline,  fuel  oil, 
the  expectation  for  heating  oil  prices,  have  jumped  as  they  have 
when  suddenly  someone  said,  ‘‘Hey,  you  know  what?  We  didn’t 
have  enough  refining  capacity  before,  and  it  has  gotten  worse  by 
Katrina  and  other  uncontrollable  events.’’  But—you’re  talking 
about, now, the industry building more refining capacity—but don’t

141 

these  things  take  a  long  time  to  plan,  design,  build?  How  long— 
what’s the cycle? 

Mr. SLAUGHTER. They do. You—it would depend on how much ca-
pacity  you’re  adding  at  an  existing  site.  If  you  were  going  to  build 
a  whole  new  refinery,  which  hasn’t  been  done  in  30  years,  you’re 
talking about at least, you know, something close to 10 years. You 
can add capacity in 3 or 4 years, but it does take awhile to do even 
that, Senator. And, you know, if you look at some of the estimates, 
I mean, most of the price of these products are driven by the price 
of  crude  oil.  And  EIA  is  basically  stating  that  they  expect  high 
crude  oil  prices  at  least  through  the  next  year,  if  not  beyond. 
And—— 

Senator LAUTENBERG. But you did say, earlier, that you’re in the 

process—the industry’s in the process of expanding capacity. 

Mr. SLAUGHTER. Yes, sir. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. So, therefore, somebody thought about it a 
couple  of  years  ago,  if  it’s  in  the  process  of  expanding  it,  and  that 
wasn’t related to the current price of the—of crude. 

Mr.  SLAUGHTER.  Most  of  these  capacity  additions  have  been  an-
nounced  recently,  and  are  still  in  the  process  of  being  announced. 
The  problem  was,  2  years  ago,  of  course,  you  had  only  maybe  one 
year of relatively decent returns and 15 years of very poor returns, 
so it has taken a while for people to think that this may be sustain-
able for at least a while, that we’re going to see better returns than 
5 percent. But it does take time to bring it online. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Before I run out of time, as the Chairman 
knows,  that  red  doesn’t  mean  stop  on  our  highways,  it  just  means 
speed up, so I’ll try to speed up. 

Mr. Kosh, I speak to you as a constituent of yours. I’m one of the 
48  million.  I  don’t  know  whether  you  noticed  my  account  or  not. 
But  the  fact  is  that  we  are  now  victimized  by  our—let  me  use  the 
word—strong word—and say ‘‘profligate’’ use of gasoline, fuel oil, et 
cetera.  Has  it  ever  occurred—and  these  are  not  suggestions,  and  I 
don’t mean to slant them that way, but it’s a question—has it ever 
occurred  to  the  AAA  that  maybe  you  ought  to  start  saying,  ‘‘Hey, 
buy more efficient vehicles. Conserve. Sacrifice’’? By the way, I can 
tell  you  this,  I  haven’t  heard  it  from  the  President  now,  or  pre-
viously,  when  things  were  obviously  tightening.  It’s  not  a  political 
thing to me. I haven’t—so, I just wonder whether—you’re a public- 
service organization, realistically, and I just wonder whether you’ve 
thought  it  wise  to  say,  ‘‘You  know  what?  We  ought  to  stop  buying 
inefficient  equipment—cars,  trucks.’’  I  see,  General  Motors  is  now 
getting very excited, and they’re advertising, about hybrids. And is 
there any suggestion that we ought to conserve a little bit? 

Mr.  KOSH.  Senator  Lautenberg,  as  a  traffic-safety  advocate,  I’ll 

also be mindful of the red there. 

We,  indeed,  have  been—we’ve  been  addressing  that  with  our 
membership since 1974, since the oil crisis there, the need for con-
servation, the need for more fuel-efficient vehicles. I mentioned ear-
lier,  in  my  prepared  remarks,  about  the  need  for  EPA  to  give  us 
a  little  better—better,  and  more  realistic,  fuel-efficiency  reportings 
of  what  those  vehicles  are  so  our  members,  and  motorists  in  gen-
eral, have an accurate estimate of what they’re using. We have had 
campaigns, and an ongoing one—and next month is our annual Car

cations constantly remind folks—— 

Senator LAUTENBERG. I’m talking about—— 
Mr. KOSH.—to need to do that for conservation and to be—— 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Well—— 
Mr.  KOSH.—and  be  more  fuel  efficient  and  more  fuel  conscious. 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Yes,  I’m  talking  about  any  campaign  that 
would  limit—and,  again,  not  being  proposed  by  me,  just  a  ques-
tion—has  there  been—anybody  seen  any  campaigns  to  say  to  the 
public-at-large, ‘‘Buy more efficient cars’’? 

Mr. KOSH. Oh, I think that’s—— 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  General  Motors  or  whoever  it  is,  the  for-
eign  cars  that  are  sold,  ‘‘Make  them  more  efficient.  Help  us  con-
serve our way out of’’—— 

Mr.  KOSH.  Well,  I  think  there  has  been  a  considerable  amount 
of  effort  in  that  regard.  And,  in  fact,  I  think  the  market  reflects 
that.  The  manufacturers  are  having  a  hard  time  keeping  up  with 
the demand for the bi-fuel vehicles, the Prius and those other vehi-
cles,  and  they  are  responding  accordingly.  And  I  think  you’re  see-
ing that, and people are actually—we’ve been telling the people, in 
recent months, to—— 

Senator LAUTENBERG. To have sales on SUVs stopped? 
Mr. KOSH. Pardon? 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Have sales on SUVs stopped? 
Mr. KOSH. I think they’ve dramatically changed. Certainly, in re-

cent months. 

just a couple of seconds. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  promise  to  wrap  up  in 

Mr.  Caruso,  I  wanted  to  ask  you  a  question.  Do  you  think  that 
OPEC’s  behavior,  and  their  compact,  has  caused  us  to  spend—to 
pay more for fuel? 

Mr. CARUSO. Oh, I think—— 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Or production—— 
Mr. CARUSO. Without question. OPEC’s policy has—— 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Yes, without question. 
Mr. CARUSO.—has been to constrain production, collude. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Yes. 
Mr. CARUSO. I mean, they certainly would be under the FTC defi-

nition of collusion and price-fixing there. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Right.  I  agree.  And  I’m  proposing  a  piece 
of  legislation  for  the  WTO,  asking  the  President  of  the  United 
States  to  request,  from  the  WTO,  that  members  of  OPEC  be  ex-
cluded  from  the  benefits  of  WTO.  Because,  under  the  WTO  cov-
enants,  agreements,  they  are  not  supposed  to  inhibit  trade  in  any 
way. And, well, Saudi Arabia would now like to join WTO, and one 
of these other major producers. I think that if we got to them, and 
they  said,  ‘‘Look,  you  can’t  join  together  like  that,  fix  prices,  and 
be  part  of  a  non-tariff  or  reduced-customs  duties  for  products  that 
you sell.’’ Think that would be a good idea? 

Mr. CARUSO. Well, I think it’s certainly worth trying. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Yes. 
I’m  sorry.  You  know  what  happens,  Mr.  Chairman?  Sometimes 
we  say  things  that  are  so  interesting,  it’s  just  hard  to  stop.  But, 
thank you very much.

The CHAIRMAN. Senator Pryor? 

143 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Let  me  ask  Mr.  Slaughter,  if  I  may—and,  by  the  way,  thank  all 
of  you  for  being  here;  this  is  very  helpful—Mr.  Slaughter,  we 
talked a little bit about refining capacity? 

Mr. SLAUGHTER. Yes, sir. 
Senator PRYOR. As you, I’m sure are aware, there is a conspiracy 
theory  going  around  about  the  oil  companies  and  their  refineries. 
And  the  conspiracy  theory  is  that  the  reason  the  oil  companies 
have  less  capacity  today  is  because,  if  they  do,  that  means  there’s 
less  product  that  could  be  refined;  therefore,  prices  are  higher  per 
gallon;  therefore,  profits  are  more.  Do  you  have  any  comment  on 
that? 

Mr. SLAUGHTER. Yes, I do, Senator Pryor. The industry has been 
steadily investing in U.S. refining over the last 25 years. As I men-
tioned  previously,  they  increased  U.S.  capacity  by  about  a  million 
barrels a day, between 1985 and 1995. We have had capacity addi-
tions  over  recent  years.  The  difficulty  has  been  that  the  demand 
growth in the United States has exceeded the additions in refining 
capacity,  so  every  year  we’ve  become  a  bit  more  dependent  on  im-
ports. 

The industry is also investing $20 billion this decade just in envi-
ronmental programs, but it is investing that money. The fact of the 
matter  is  that,  you  know,  there’s  limited  money  for  investment  in 
any  particular  enterprise,  and  a  lot  of  the  money  over  the  years, 
particularly  when  there  was  low  return  in  this  business,  has  gone 
into  environmentally-mandated  investments  that  didn’t  always 
yield additional capacity. But it was very expensive. 

Senator PRYOR. All right. Well, let me follow up on that, if I may, 
because  you  talk  about  capacity  and  profitability,  and  we’ve  all 
read, in papers and—et cetera, that the oil industry is more profit-
able today than it—maybe it has ever been. Now, I want to ask you 
about  that  in  1  second,  but  first  let  me  mention,  I  have  the  AAA’s 
news  release—the  AAA  Mid-Atlantic  region’s  news  release  about 
this—news  release  about  Exxon.  You  probably  saw  that.  They  did 
that on 9/9/05. 

Let  me  ask  this.  I  want  to—not  to  pick  on  Exxon,  but  since 
they’re  the  subject  of  this  release,  let  me  ask  you  this  question. 
When  Exxon  drills  in  the  Gulf,  right—the  Gulf  of  Mexico—I  as-
sume they own that drilling unit, that derrick out there—they own 
that, in the Gulf? 

Mr. SLAUGHTER. Probably, yes. 
Senator PRYOR. And then they ship that in, let’s just say, to Lou-
isiana  to  be  refined  at  one  of  their  refineries,  right?  So,  they  own 
that refinery, as well. 

Mr. SLAUGHTER. They have several refineries in that area. 
Senator  PRYOR.  Right.  I’m  just  using  them  as  a  hypothetical— 
again, not to pick on them, not to be too particular about the facts. 
But  when  Exxon  pumps  that  out  of  the  ocean  floor,  I—do  they  as-
sign a cost to that? I mean, do they know how much that’s costing 
them per barrel, or per gallon, to pump out of the ocean floor?

Mr. SLAUGHTER. To produce it? 
Senator PRYOR. Yes. 
Mr.  SLAUGHTER.  Well,  basically,  you  know,  like  most  commod-
ities, you know, in the marketplace, the market price doesn’t really 
depend  on  the  cost  of  production,  although  the  cost  of  production 
is significant for offshore oil, of the kind you’re mentioning. 

Senator PRYOR. No, I understand that. But they—somehow, they 

know how much it costs them to get that oil—— 

Mr. SLAUGHTER. Yes, sir. 
Senator PRYOR.—out of the Earth, and get it transported to their 
refinery  in  Louisiana.  And  then,  it  is  refined  in  Louisiana,  at  one 
of  their  refineries,  which  they  own.  Let’s  just  stay  with  that  hypo-
thetical.  And  then  it’s  put  into  a  pipeline.  Now,  who  owns  that 
pipeline? 

Mr.  SLAUGHTER.  Pipeline  is  probably  a  common-carrier  pipe-

Senator PRYOR. OK. 
Mr. SLAUGHTER.—that comes out of the Gulf area. It would prob-

ably be Plantation or Colonial. 

Senator PRYOR. OK. 
Mr. SLAUGHTER. There are various ownerships of that—— 
Senator PRYOR. Right. 
Mr.  SLAUGHTER.—small  percentages,  essentially,  of  different 

line—— 

companies. 

Senator  PRYOR.  OK.  So,  in  other  words,  Exxon  may  own  a  per-

centage of that, but a lot of other companies own a percentage. 

Mr. SLAUGHTER. That’s correct. That would be no more than, like 

5 percent, if, indeed, they own any at all. And I don’t—— 

Senator PRYOR. Yes. 
Mr. SLAUGHTER.—know for sure. 
Senator PRYOR. And, again, I’m not holding you to that. I under-
stand we’re talking about a hypothetical here. But, nonetheless, as-
sume, if they did own some of that, they would be profiting off the 
pipeline,  probably  to  a  pretty  small  degree,  but,  nonetheless,  I’m 
sure they would charge something that would—— 

Mr. SLAUGHTER. The—— 
Senator PRYOR.—profit. 
Mr. SLAUGHTER.—pipeline rates are regulated, and they don’t de-
pend  on  the  price  of  the—that  you’re  actually  getting  for  the  com-
modity. It’s just—— 

Senator PRYOR. Right. 
Mr. SLAUGHTER.—a pass-through. Yes. 
Senator PRYOR. Right. And so, then—let’s say that that’s—one of 
these  pipelines  ends  up,  say,  in  the  Baltimore  area.  I  don’t  know 
exactly  where  their  big  storage  tanks  are  here,  but  let’s  just  say 
there.  And  that  is  refined  gasoline.  And,  if  put  into  a  truck,  let’s 
say it’s going to go to an Exxon station, who owns that storage fa-
cility, say, outside of Baltimore? Is that an Exxon facility, or is that 
an independent? What is that? 

Mr.  SLAUGHTER.  Well,  what  often  happens  is,  you’d  have  a— 
you’d have a rack facility that—at which there might be a number 
of companies that would load trucks out-of-the-rack at the terminus 
of a pipeline. 

Senator PRYOR. Yes.

Mr.  SLAUGHTER.  Now,  if  you  had  a  refinery  there,  which  you 
don’t in that particular instance, the refinery owner might own the 
rack. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Right.  But  what  I’m  saying  is,  who,  then,  hauls 

it from that storage facility to the local Exxon station? 

Mr. SLAUGHTER. Well, there are three different ways, really, that 
gasoline would be distributed from a terminal like that. It could be 
sold  wholesale  to  a  jobber,  who’s  a  distributor,  who  might  take 
large amounts of gasoline and have his own stations. It could, basi-
cally,  be  put  in  a  tank  truck  that’s  at  Exxon.  But  it  could  be  dis-
tributed  to  an  independent  service-station  dealer,  who  would  take 
title to the gasoline in his driveway. Or it could go—and this is not 
often  the  case—to  a  company-operated  station  that—so,  it’s  an  in-
ternal transfer there. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Right.  And  the  reason  I’m  asking  all  this  is  be-
cause  I’m  trying  to  determine  the  various  cost  factors  that  go  into 
the  price  of  a  gallon  of  gasoline,  and  it—as  we  just  ran  through 
several  steps,  there  are  a  lot  of  middlemen,  or  there’s  lot  of  poten-
tial  little  profit  centers  there  for  different  companies  or  different 
people. Is that correct? 

Mr.  SLAUGHTER.  There  are  different  people  who  are  involved  in 

the handling of the product, yes. 

Senator PRYOR. Right. And the reason—it would be reasonable to 
assume  that  they  all  make  a  little  profit  for  handling  the  product. 
Mr.  SLAUGHTER.  There  are  different  amounts.  The  largest  price 
factor,  though,  still,  Senator,  is  going  to  be  the  price  of  crude, 
which is going to be 50 to 60 percent of the cost of production. 

Senator PRYOR. I was going to ask about that. I have this—— 
Mr. SLAUGHTER. Yes, sir. 
Senator  PRYOR.—little  chart  from  NPRA.  And,  as  I  understand 
it,  these  numbers  might  fluctuate  a  little  bit,  but,  right  there, 
you—in crude oil, it says 55 percent. So, what you’re saying is, for 
a  gallon  of  gasoline,  about  55  percent  of  that  is  the  cost  of  the  oil 
itself, right? 

Mr. SLAUGHTER. Yes, sir. 
Senator PRYOR. And then you have taxes, you have—— 
Mr. SLAUGHTER. Of 20 percent. 
Senator  PRYOR.  Yes—you  have  distribution  and  marketing,  you 
have  refining.  Those  costs  are  all  built  into  that.  But  one  question 
I  have  is,  when  gasoline  is,  say,  $1.25  a  gallon,  versus  about  $3  a 
gallon,  it  doesn’t  cost  any  more  to  market  the  gasoline,  or  dis-
tribute it. I wouldn’t think it would cost any more to refine it. And 
I  wouldn’t  think  the  taxes  would  be  any  more,  because  that’s  usu-
ally  on  a  per-gallon  basis,  not  on  a  sales-tax  type  basis,  a  percent-
age of the cost. So, it seems to me that all these numbers fluctuate. 
It  depends  on  how  high  the  price  of  the  gasoline  is.  Is  that  true, 
or not? 

Mr. SLAUGHTER. The—you know, a major factor is going to be the 
replacement  cost  of  the  gasoline,  Senator  Pryor.  For  instance,  a— 
someone like Exxon who is manufacturing gasoline, if an event like 
Hurricane  Katrina  happens,  and  has  the  impact  on  the  futures 
market that that event had, the prospective cost of all replacement 
crude and products is going to go up. And if—just like the service- 
station dealer also has to think about buying the next cargo of gas-

146 

oline,  rather  than  just  looking  at  what  his—what  he  happens  to 
have  on  hand  has  cost  him.  Because  if  he  doesn’t  look  forward  by 
using  the  futures  market,  or  other  indicators,  as  to  what  his  re-
placement  cost  is  going  to  be,  he’s  going  to  be  perpetually  bor-
rowing money to buy his next cargo, and it’s going to be a very dif-
ficult situation for him. 

Same  would  be  true  of  a  refiner/manufacturer  that—when 
Katrina  hit,  no  one  knew  when  they  were  going  to  be  able  to  get 
crude supplies again, no one knew when they were going to be able 
to  provide  products  to  their  customers  again,  and  they  would  look 
at  the  futures  market  as  to  what  the  futures  market  was  saying 
about,  ‘‘Well,  this  is  what,  you  know,  the  best  estimates  are  of 
where  prices  are  headed  in  the  future.’’  And  you’ve,  basically,  also 
got  to  calibrate  that  into  your  thinking,  as  well  as  the  production 
costs that you’ve alluded to on the EIA sheet. 

Under normal conditions, you know, EIA does a map, like you’ve 
pointed  out,  about  once  a  month,  and  the  numbers  change  a  little 
bit, but not very much. But an event like Hurricane Katrina, which 
is,  you  know,  a  direct  hit  on  the  infrastructure,  is  going  to  affect 
futures  prices,  and  everyone’s  calculations  of  what  they’re  going  to 
have  to  do  to  stay  in  business  and  have  product  over  the  next  few 
days and weeks. 

Senator PRYOR. Well, I would like to ask you about future prices, 
but  I’m  out  of  time.  But,  Mr.  Caruso,  you  were,  kind  of,  shaking 
your  head  at  this  chart.  Do  you  want  to  add  anything  to  that?  I’ll 
turn it back over to the Chairman. 

Mr.  CARUSO.  It’s  a  pretty  minor  point,  but  there  are  some  costs 

that are ad valorem percentages. 

Senator PRYOR. Right. 
Mr.  CARUSO.  For  example,  credit-card  companies  charge  a  per-
centage  of  the  transaction,  so  a  retail  dealer  who’s  selling  $1.50 
gasoline may pay Visa 3 percent, if you were to use your Visa. So, 
3  percent  of  a  buck–50  is  four  and  a  half  cents.  If  you’re  charging 
$3,  you  have  to  pay  Visa  9  cents.  So,  that’s  four  and  a  half  cents 
that  the  dealer  would  have  to—the  retail  dealer  would  have  to 
achieve in order just to cover that additional cost. 

In  the  situation  that  we’re  talking  about  here,  it  may  not  be  a 
lot,  but  for  an  individual  retailer,  four  and  a  half  cents  could  be 
quite a bit. 

Senator  PRYOR.  But—and  I’ll  turn  it  over  to  the  Chairman  right 
here—but,  as  I  understand  it,  you  do  agree  that  if  the  underlying 
cost of the fuel is going up, that doesn’t necessarily mean the refin-
ing  costs,  the  marketing  costs,  the  taxes—they’re  not  necessarily 
going up, right? 

Mr. CARUSO. Not on a strict cost basis, Senator Pryor. 
Senator PRYOR. Thank you. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  I  think  we  ought  to  make  it  very  plain  that  we 
all dislike this concept of gouging the public unreasonably, particu-
larly after a State of Emergency, a disaster such as this. The ques-
tion  is  how  to  define  that  and  who  should  really  police  it.  Cur-
rently,  the  states  have—14  states  have  price-gouging  laws.  The 
Federal  Government  has  never  had  one.  And  the  question  really 
presented to us by these bills is whether we should have one.

Would  any  of  you  believe—let’s  go  through  the  four  of  you.  Our 
colleagues  went  over  about  5  minutes,  but  I  think  Senator  Inouye 
and  I  will  split  this  time.  And  my  question  is  this:  do  you  think 
it’s  possible  to  frame  a  law  which  would  meet  the  demands  of  the 
public  for  some  control  over  price-gouging,  as  it’s  understood  by 
John  Q.  Citizen,  which  is,  I  think,  that  someone’s  trying  to  make 
more  money  out  of  a  disaster  than  is  warranted  by  the  cost  of  his 
product  that  he’s  trying  to  sell?  Is  that  a  reasonable  discussion— 
a way to pose it? 

Mr. Slaughter, what do you think? 
Mr.  SLAUGHTER.  Well,  I  think,  given  the  oversight  that  has  al-
ready  been  described  to  you  by—that  FTC  has  over  the  market-
place  and  everything  already,  they’re  looking  at  market  conditions 
and transactions nationwide. There are a number of state statutes. 
The  difficulty  in  framing  the  statute  is  that  you  can  end  up  with 
something  that  is  back-door  regulation  of  gasoline  prices.  And  I 
think  you  have  to  weigh  the  risks,  versus  the  positives.  And  I 
would  tread,  frankly,  very  carefully  there,  in  terms  of  a  Federal 
statute,  given  everything  that  FTC,  GAO,  and  others  are  already 
doing to police the market. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  The  alternative  is  a  price  cap.  President  Nixon 

put one on once, you remember? 

Mr. SLAUGHTER. 1971. I was here, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. Yes, I was here, too. We were both here. But that 

didn’t work. 

Mr. SLAUGHTER. No, sir. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Now,  which  alternative  is  advisable,  from  the 

point of view of the industry? Neither? 

Mr. SLAUGHTER. Well, if you looked at something in extreme cir-
cumstances in emergencies, and you could frame gouging, it would 
be  preferable  to  price  caps,  because,  as  you  know,  it  took  10  years 
to  work  out  of  that  system  and  get  back  to  market  pricing,  in  the 
national  interest.  And  we’d  be  very  concerned  about  imposition  of 
price caps. 

The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Slocum? 
Mr.  SLOCUM.  Well,  I  mean,  first  of  all,  I  think  it’s  abundantly 
clear that price-gouging is going on. One thing that the Committee 
could do is call in the trader who was quoted in his Dow Jones arti-
cle,  boasting  that  there  are  so  many  energy  traders  making  so 
much  money  off  of  the  hurricane,  that  they  made  so  much  money 
in one week that they didn’t have to work the rest of the year. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  now  you’re  talking  about  energy  traders, 

rather than people who are selling gasoline. 

Mr. SLOCUM. Well, right, yes. There are two different components 
to my testimony. One was dealing with energy traders, and the sec-
ond  is  dealing  with  the  vertically  integrated  oil  companies.  And  I 
think  that  there  is  evidence  of  price-gouging  going  on  in  both  in-
dustries. 

I think the first thing to do is call in Addison-Armstrong—— 
The CHAIRMAN. The second one is subject to control by the FTC. 

The first one is SEC. 

Mr. SLOCUM.—or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 
The CHAIRMAN. I see.

148 

Mr.  SLOCUM.  But  Congress  also  has  jurisdiction,  because  Con-
gress rolled back some of those regulations. And so, more than half 
of  the  energy  trading  that’s  going  on  today  is  in  under-regulated 
exchanges—so-called  over-the-counter  derivatives  markets.  And 
there’s a lot written about this in the trade—— 

The  CHAIRMAN.  You’re  saying  that  the  speculators  are  the  ones 

that are gouging. 

Mr.  SLOCUM.  I’m  saying  that  the  speculators  are  gouging,  and 
I’m saying that the vertically integrated oil companies are also en-
gaging  in  uncompetitive  practices  that  results  in  price-gouging. 
There are—— 

The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Caruso? 
Mr.  SLOCUM.—two  different  industries  where  it’s  occurring,  Sen-

ator. 

The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Caruso? 
Mr.  CARUSO.  Well,  as  you  know,  EIA  is  not  in  the  policy  game, 

but maybe I can take off that hat and—— 

The CHAIRMAN. You’ve been here several times. We—— 
Mr. CARUSO. I’ll give you my—— 
The CHAIRMAN.—we really value your opinion, not—— 
Mr. CARUSO.—I can give you my opinion. 
The CHAIRMAN. We’re just looking for advice. 
Mr.  CARUSO.  My  opinion,  as  an  economist,  is,  anything  we  can 
do  to  avoid  price  controls,  that  would  be  the  road  to  go  on.  With 
respect to—I think there are a lot of authorities that the FTC, and 
SEC,  and  others  have  already.  For  something  like  the  issue  that 
we’re  dealing  with,  you  know,  the  tough-to-define  price-gouging,  it 
seems  to  me  the  closer  you  get  to  the  actual  retail  level  or  whole-
sale  level,  the  better  you  are.  And,  to  me,  that  means  the  states. 
The states’ authorities should be really where I would focus on. 

The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Kosh? 
Mr.  KOSH.  Well,  I  think  the  last  thing  we  want  to  do  is  return 
to  what  we  experienced  in  the  early  1970s,  with  price  controls. 
That would be the—that would be the most distasteful. 

The  other  thing  is,  whether  or  not  those  14  states  that  have 
price-gouging  statutes,  are  they  actually  doing  what  they’re  in-
tended to do? If they are, there may be room for that at the Federal 
level.  Again,  our  preference  would  be  to  probably  keep  it  at  the 
State level. But I think it warrants exploration at this—at the na-
tional level if the states aren’t doing what they should be. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  I  think  I  should  state,  for  the  record,  that  I  was 
told,  by  the  national  entities  that  distribute  gasoline,  that  the 
prices that they’re charging in the disaster area in Louisiana, Mis-
sissippi,  and  Alabama  were  pre-disaster  prices.  They  had  frozen 
the prices down there for people consuming gasoline in the disaster 
area. Is that your understanding, Mr. Slaughter? 

Mr.  SLAUGHTER.  That  is  happening  some  places,  sir.  Also,  you 
know,  even  the  wholesalers,  the  refiner/sellers  have  frozen  prices 
in  some  of  that  area,  and  many  of  them  are  selling  product  well 
below spot price. So, it varies by individual company and individual 
retailer. 

The CHAIRMAN. Well, they do deserve some credit for that. 
Senator Inouye? 
Senator INOUYE. Thank you.

trust? 

Mr.  Slocum,  I’ve  read  your  testimony  very  carefully.  And  you 
speak  of  these  mergers,  and  the  control  that  they  have  over  refin-
eries, and then you say, and I quote, ‘‘This dramatic increase in the 
control of just the top five companies makes it easier for oil compa-
nies  to  manipulate  gasoline  by  intentionally  withholding  supplies 
in order to drive up prices.’’ 

By that statement, are you suggesting conspiracy, collusion, anti-

Mr. SLOCUM. Senator, the basis for what I wrote there comes di-
rectly  from  a  March  2001  investigation  by  the  United  States  Fed-
eral  Trade  Commission.  They  did  a  major  investigation  into  what 
then were considered price spikes in the Midwest gasoline market. 
The Federal Trade Commission found conclusive evidence of inten-
tional  withholding  on  the  part  of  U.S.  oil  companies  for  the  sole 
purpose of creating shortages in order to drive the price of gasoline 
up.  And  I  quote  in  my  testimony  the  key  passages  from  that  Fed-
eral Trade Commission investigation, which says, in part, ‘‘An exec-
utive of one company made clear that he’d rather sell less gasoline 
and earn a higher margin on each gallon sold than sell more gaso-
line  and  earn  a  lower  margin.’’  Now,  economists  refer  to  this  as, 
you know, ‘‘economic withholding.’’ But I think what regular people 
on  the  street  would  call  that  is  ‘‘price-gouging.’’  It’s  an  uncompeti-
tive practice, plain and simple. 

If  you  have  the  ability  to  intentionally  withhold  a  product  from 
the marketplace, that means you know that there is no other com-
petitor  in  the  region  that  can  offer  a  competing  product  to  sell. 
That  is  clear  evidence  to  Public  Citizen  of  uncompetitive  markets. 
That’s not what made America the greatest country on Earth. 

What  we  need  to  do  is  to  enforce  more  competitive  markets  by 
reassessing  the  wisdom  of  all  these  recent  mergers,  by  having  im-
mediate investigations, including the power of subpoena, so we can 
get  internal  company  memos  that  describe  if  there  was  any  collu-
sion that went on with this intentional withholding. And if this in-
tentional  withholding  was  going  on  in  2000  and  2001,  imagine 
what’s  going  on  after  the  mergers  of  ChevronTexaco,  the  mergers 
of  Conoco  and  Phillips,  the  mergers  between  Valero  and  Ultramar 
Diamond  Shamrock,  and  then  Orion  Refining  and  Premcor.  There 
has  been  merger  after  merger  after  merger  that  has  been  ap-
proved—like  the  Government  Accountability  Office  says,  2,600 
mergers  that  the  Federal  Government  has  approved,  that  has  re-
duced competition, and it has allowed price-gouging. Those are the 
facts. 

Senator  INOUYE.  What  did  the  FTC  do  as  a  result  of  this  inves-

tigation? 

Mr.  SLOCUM.  The  FTC  did  nothing,  because  they  found  no  evi-
dence  of  collusion;  and,  therefore,  they  said  there  was  no  evidence 
of  violation  of  antitrust  law.  And,  as  Senator  Wyden  testified  ear-
lier, that shows a clear loophole in Federal law, that it would make 
sense to empower the FTC to take action where it currently cannot, 
and that is, if an entity is unilaterally withholding or otherwise en-
gaging  in  anticompetitive  behavior,  the  FTC  should  have  full  pow-
ers to act and take punitive action against those entities. 

Senator INOUYE. Mr. Slaughter, I see your hand’s up there.

Mr. SLAUGHTER. Sorry, Senator, but I want to just say something 
about  the  FTC.  The  FTC  looked  at  the  exact  same  Midwestern 
price  situation  under  Chairman  Pitofsky  in  2001.  They  published 
a  report  on  it.  They  looked  at  the  exact  same  situation  that  has 
just  been  discussed.  They  said,  ‘‘There  were—this  is—there  were 
many causes for the extraordinary price spike in Midwest markets 
last Summer,’’ stated Chairman Pitofsky. ‘‘Importantly, there is no 
evidence that the price increases were a result of conspiracy or any 
other  antitrust  violation.  Indeed,  most  of  the  causes  were  beyond 
the  immediate  control  of  the  oil  companies.’’  And  that’s  Chairman 
Pitofsky, of the Federal Trade Commission, who looked at the exact 
same situation that has just been discussed. 

And  the  FTC  put  out  a  major  compendium  of  all  its  actions  in 
reviewing mergers in 2004, that looked back at all the major indus-
try  mergers  between  1995  and  2004.  They  detailed  the  fact  that 
they looked at all of them in great detail; where they saw any com-
petitive  problems,  they  required  divestments  of  different  parts  of 
the  companies  in  order  to  make  sure  there  was  no  problem  with 
competition.  And  I’d  commend  that  material,  as  well  as  this  study 
by the FTC on the 2001 Midwest situation, to the Committee. 

Senator  INOUYE.  Mr.  Slaughter,  in  response  to  Senator  Lauten-
berg’s  question  on  price-gouging,  your  response  was,  in  essence, 
‘‘The  problem  is  very  complex,  there  are  many  facets  to  it,’’  and 
your  response  now.  Am  I  to  assume  that  you’re  telling  us  that 
there’s no such thing as price-gouging? 

Mr.  SLAUGHTER.  No,  sir,  I’m  not.  There,  obviously,  is  some  kind 
of extreme behavior that might take place in the—in an emergency 
situation  that  probably  will  not  last  very  long,  because  the  emer-
gency  situation  won’t  last  very  long.  But  it’s  so  offensive  that,  cer-
tainly, people who purchase—— 

Senator INOUYE. How would you—— 
Mr. SLAUGHTER.—gasoline have great problems with it. 
Senator INOUYE. What would you constitute as ‘‘so offensive’’? 
Mr. SLAUGHTER. Well, if—for instance, just, again, taking—all we 
have  is  anecdotal  evidence,  because  the  agencies  that  look  at  pric-
ing are still looking at it, and there hasn’t been any kind of report. 
We have anecdotes. But people have been talking about $6 and $7 
gasoline prices. That seems clearly out of order. Now, we have seen 
prices  go  up  into  the  $3,  but  that’s  in  lots  of  parts  of  the  country, 
and  it  seems  to  show  the  shutdown  of  the  system  that  occurred 
with Katrina. Where you have these spot retail prices that are $6– 
$7,  if  that’s,  indeed,  true,  that  is  something  that  I  think  you  could 
say that looks like there’s a problem there that people ought to look 
into. But when people are just saying, ‘‘Well, gee, things have gone 
up  into  the  $3,’’  but  they’ve  done  that  everywhere,  it  doesn’t  seem 
to be the same problem. 

Senator INOUYE. Mr. Slocum? 
Mr. SLOCUM. Well, I—and, like I said, I think it’s very clear that 
we have evidence of anticompetitive practices, that prices are high-
er  than  they  would  be  if  we  had  adequately  competitive  markets, 
and that—yes? 

Senator INOUYE. Yes, I have one more question. I notice my time 
is up. You have indicated in your testimony that 15 percent of Fed-

eral  lands  are  off  limits  to  drilling,  57  percent  are  wide  open.  Are 
you suggesting that we should be drilling in that 57 percent? 

Mr.  SLOCUM.  No,  Mr.  Senator,  I  am  not.  I  was  merely  pointing 
out  the  results  of  a  Department  of  the  Interior  survey  of  the  role 
of  environmental  regulations  in  restricting,  or  not  restricting,  ac-
cess  to  oil  and  natural  gas  drilling.  And  in  that  study,  it  said,  as 
you  pointed  out,  that  57  percent  of  Federal  lands  are  currently 
open to Federal drilling. And I’m not making any comments in sup-
port  or  against—of  drilling  in  those  areas,  but  just  that  very  often 
you hear from the industry, whether it was Ken Lay’s Enron or oil 
companies today, that environmentalists and environmental protec-
tions  are  the  root  of  the  problem.  And  I  think  that  that  Depart-
ment  of  the  Interior  study  conclusively  shows  that  the  vast  major-
ity  of  Federal  lands  are  open  and  accessible  to  oil  drilling.  And  so, 
environmental laws and other sensible laws are not to blame. 

Senator INOUYE. I would gather that you’ve studied the situation 
in  Europe.  How  would  you  compare  environmental  laws  in  the 
United States and European environmental laws? 

Mr.  SLOCUM.  Unfortunately,  Mr.  Senator,  I  have  not—I  would 
not  consider  myself  a  student  of  European  environmental  laws. 
And so, I don’t really know. I know that there are only a few Euro-
pean  countries  that  actually  produce  oil—namely,  Norway  and  the 
U.K.,  and  in  the  North  Sea.  And  so,  as  a  whole,  you  know,  most 
of Europe does not have access to the kind of energy resources that 
the United States has. 

Senator INOUYE. Thank you very much. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Pryor? 
Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr.—— 
The  CHAIRMAN.  We  are  committed  to  get  to  that  other  briefing. 
As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  Senate  is  now  in  session  so  we’ll  all  be 
there, but we want to yield to you for what—— 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you. I’ll try to do this in about 2 or 3 min-
utes, if I can, so I’ll try to ask my questions fast, and hopefully you 
all can come up with some fast answers. 

Mr.  Slocum,  Public  Citizen  has  drafted  a  five-point  reform  plan 
that, it says, can restore accountability to oil and gas markets, and 
provide consumer protection. One of the points is to re-regulate en-
ergy trading exchanges to restore transparency. Will you elaborate 
on  regulating  over-the-counter  crude  oil  and  gasoline  futures  mar-
kets? 

Mr.  SLOCUM.  Yes,  sir,  Senator.  In  the  year  2000,  the  U.S.  Con-
gress  passed  the  Commodity  Futures  Modernization  Act,  which, 
among  other  things,  deregulated  energy  trading  exchanges  by  ex-
panding  the  definition  of  what  was  allowable  to  be  engaged  on 
over-the-counter  derivatives  markets.  Over-the-counter  derivatives 
markets  essentially  started  out  as  exchanges  between  two  entities 
to make agreements or contracts to trade products. 

Senator PRYOR. Right. 
Mr.  SLOCUM.  Data  by  various  government  entities  indicate  that 
now, after the passage of this law, more than half of energy trading 
in  the  United  States  is  on  these  over-the-counter  derivatives  mar-
kets. What that means is, less information is being reported to Fed-
eral regulators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In

financial 

Public  Citizen’s  view,  the  less  scrutiny  that  markets  have,  the 
greater  ability  of  market  participants  to  game  the  system  occurs. 

Senator PRYOR. OK. Now, let me stop you there. 
Mr. SLOCUM. Yes, sir. 
Senator  PRYOR.  Is  Public  Citizen  saying  that  some  of  these 
record profits from the oil companies—are some of these profits at-
tributed  to  their  participation  in  an  over-the-counter  futures  mar-
ket? 

Mr.  SLOCUM.  No.  I  think  that  they  are  two  separate  things.  The 
data  indicate  that  the  biggest  participants  in  these  over-the- 
counter  exchanges  are 
institutions—mainly  hedge 
funds—— 

Senator PRYOR. Right. 
Mr. SLOCUM.—which I know that the new Chairman of the Secu-
rities  and  Exchange  Commission  has  supported  some  tighter  regu-
lation  over  those  financial  instruments.  And  I  think  that  tougher 
scrutiny  of  their  actions  on  these  over-the-counter  exchanges  are 
required, as well. 

Senator  PRYOR.  OK.  Now,  someone  mentioned,  earlier,  the  Stra-
tegic  Petroleum  Reserve.  Was  that  you,  Mr.  Slaughter,  in  your— 
you  did?  And  my  question  for  you  all—maybe  you  answered  this 
when  I  was  out  of  the  room;  I  had  to  step  out  for  a  minute—but 
my question for you is: if we were to open the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve,  what  impact  would  that  have  on  gas  prices?  I  mean, 
what’s the net effect for the general public? 

Mr.  SLAUGHTER.  Well,  I’ll  just  mention  that  it—that,  you  know, 
it’s supposed to only be used in the event of an emergency, and it’s 
not supposed to be used for price-related reasons. Obviously, when 
it  was  opened,  after  Katrina,  it  did  have  a  considerable  effect  in 
smoothing  out  the  marketplace,  and  reassuring  people  that  crude 
would  be  available,  and  that  was  appropriate  usage,  although 
things  have  come  back  to  the  point  where  all  of  the  amount  prof-
fered  was  not  used.  But  it  did  significantly  calm  the  situation  and 
let  refiners  know  that  crude  would  be  available,  and  let  our  cus-
tomers think that the products would be available. 

Senator  PRYOR.  So,  does  it  lower  prices  or  stabilize  the  market, 

or both? 

Mr.  SLAUGHTER.  It  is—it  depends—basically,  when  it  has  been 
used, it has, more or less, stabilized the marketplace. It sometimes 
has  an  impact  on  prices.  I  mean,  when  it  was  used  with  the  case 
with Hurricane Ivan, there were people who needed the crude. You 
didn’t have a Katrina-like situation there. With Katrina, it did both 
have an impact on prices, and also stabilized the market. 

Senator PRYOR. Mr. Chairman, I know we all need to get to that 

hearing, so I’ll end for now, and I may—— 

The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Caruso looked like he wanted to answer that 

Senator PRYOR. Oh. 
Mr. CARUSO. No, I—— 
The CHAIRMAN. No? 
Mr. CARUSO. I thought it had a rather significant effect on prices, 
because  of  the  price  at  which  the  releases  were  made.  So,  it  did— 
in theory, would have an impact on the price. When it’s coming out

in the 30s and the market’s at 66, there ought to be a pass-through 
on that price. 

The CHAIRMAN. Well, we’re not going to close this hearing. We’re 
going  to  review  the  material  that  has  been  given  to  us.  There  are 
some  other  requests  from  other  Senators  to  be  involved.  And  I 
think we have to continue this. 

I  just  think  we  ought  to  serve  notice,  though,  that  the  extent  of 
the  price  increase  right  after  Katrina  was  outlandish  and  has 
brought  some  of  us  to  the  point  where  we  think  we  may  have  to 
pursue some of these suggestions. I do believe that we have to have 
greater  action  on  the  part  of  the  states  that  have  these  price- 
gouging laws. We haven’t been able to examine what they did. My 
next  hope  is  that  we’ll  be  able  to  call  some  of  them  in  and  ask 
them, did they use those laws? And, if not, why not? 

Thank you all very much.

A P P E N D I X 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. TED STEVENS TO 

ODD-EVEN BUSTNES 

Executive Summary 

The more demand grows at the rapid rates, we have experienced in recent years, 
the more prices will remain high. This increase in price will occur because producers 
can  sustain  these  high  prices  by  not  adding  more  capacity  than  necessary  to  just 
meet  market  demand.  The  price  increase  does  not  arise  because  producers  need 
these  prices  to  provide  new  supplies  into  the  market.  Therefore,  we  cannot,  and 
should  not,  expect  oil  producers  to  alleviate  prices  over  the  long  run.  Instead,  we 
must turn to demand. 

The degree of demand response to higher oil prices will largely determine the ulti-
mate  disposition  of  the  oil  markets  and  prices,  far  more  than  increases  in  supply. 
There  is  considerable  system  inertia  at  a  global  level,  due  to  the  time  required  to 
turn  over  the  transportation  capital  stock.  However,  the  actions  of  the  U.S.,  China, 
and  India  will  determine  whether  global  demand  for  oil  stabilizes  and  then  falls, 
or  whether  the  demand  for  oil  continues  to  rise  unabated.  As  Pogo  said,  ‘‘we  have 
met the enemy, and it is us.’’ 

As  our  study,  Winning  the  Oil  End  Game  showed,  the  U.S.  has  the  ability  to  re-
duce  its  demand  for  oil  by  more  than  50  percent  of  projected  use  from  efficiency 
alone, and up to 75 percent if the biofuels substitution potential is fully tapped. The 
technologies needed for this transition exist today and consumers want them. Thus, 
the role of government is to create the set of conditions that support investment by 
the private sector and accelerate adoption of these technologies. 

Question  1.  There  is  a  great  deal  of  uncertainty  involved  in  the  global  oil  supply. 
There have recently been a number of questions raised about the point of ‘‘Peak oil’’ 
production,  or  the  optimal  level  of  global  excavation  per  day.  Currently,  the  world 
consumes  roughly  84  million  barrels  a  day,  and  that  number  continues  to  rise.  At 
what  price  must  oil  production  continue  in  order  to  meet  the  growing  demand  in 
the next 5, 10, 20 years? 

Answer.  The  price  of  crude  oil  is  based  on  three  factors:  supply/demand  fun-
damentals, perceived risks, and technical trading. From a fundamentals perspective, 
two factors matter the most: (1) the amount of excess capacity in the global oil sys-
tem, and (2) the required returns from the oil fields that are producing on the mar-
gin. 

Historical  analysis  reveals  that  crude  oil  prices  are  closely  related  to  the  amount 
of  global  excess  oil  production  capacity.  When  excess  global  capacity  is  low,  crude 
prices and associated volatility increase, as shown in the following figure:

Excess capacity can be low for three reasons. First, producers withdraw capacity, 
as  in  the  1970s  oil  shocks  (which  have  increased  perceived  risk  adding  the  rise  in 
prices).  Second,  excess  capacity  can  decrease  due  to  wars  or  political  disruption,  as 
in the 1991 Gulf War (which typically creates spikes if the events are of short dura-
tion).  Finally,  an  increase  in  demand  can  outstrip  increases  in  supply  (the  current 
situation). In sum, for a given level of real and perceived political risk, it is the rel-
ative  level  of  excess  capacity  that  is  the  critical  and  fundamental  variable  that  de-
termines crude oil market psychology, and therefore price levels. 

The  next  fundamentals  question  is  the  price  required  to  provide  adequate  return 
on  capital  from  the  marginal  field.  This  represents  the  oil  price  floor  for  a  given 
level of demand. As disclosed by international oil companies (see chart immediately 
below),  the  prices  required  for  a  producer  to  bring  on  new  supplies  of  conventional 
oil  are  remarkably  low.  For  the  reserves  owned  by  the  international  oil  companies, 
as  long  as  prices  are  above  $15/bbl,  it  is  profitable  to  exploit  these  oil  fields  (i.e., 
oil companies would earn adequate return on capital). For reserves owned by OPEC, 
the marginal cost of production for new fields is as low as $5/bbl. The economic pur-
pose  of  the  OPEC  cartel  is  to  withdraw  these  low-cost  supplies  from  the  market, 
in order to make the market price be set by the higher cost oil fields. 

The  marginal  cost  of  meeting  increasing  demand  is  rising,  as  reserves  of  conven-
tional oil supplies decline. Enhanced oil recovery represents that next block of acces-
sible  oil  reserves,  and  typically  requires  prices  in  the  $20–$25/bbl  range.  The  more 
exotic unconventional sources, such as oil shales and oil sands require prices in the 
$40/bbl  range  to  be  economically  exploited,  as  is  evident  from  the  following  chart:

There are several important implications from these facts: First, the price needed 
by oil producers to induce them to meet demand is very low compared to the market 
price  we  are  currently  experiencing.  Second,  the  current  prices  are  more  than  ade-
quate for both conventional and unconventional oil to be brought on line. Third, we 
are  not  running  out  of  oil  per  se,  but  we  are  running  out  of  conventional  oil.  The 
proven  reserves  of  conventional  and  unconventional  sources  can  last  at  least  40–60 
years, depending on demand. 

However,  the  majority  of  the  lower  cost  conventional  oil  sources  are  increasingly 
concentrated  in  the  Gulf  and  FSU,  posing  a  security  problem  for  the  U.S.  The  U.S. 
can  no  longer  drill  its  way  out  of  the  problem  as  we  did  back  in  the  days  when 
Texas crude was the dominant source of oil. Today, the U.S. uses 26 percent of glob-
al supply, but produces only 9 percent and owns only 2–3 percent of known reserves. 
The appendix provides a more complete overview of the U.S. oil problem. 

Question 1a. Why then are prices so high? 
Answer.  The  answer  lies  in  cartel  behavior.  The  oil  producers  recognize  that  ex-
cess capacity lowers the price down to the price floors required for adequate return 
on  capital.  The  brief  period  of  very  low  oil  prices  during  the  1997–1998  Asian  Eco-
nomic  crisis  demonstrated  the  impact  of  excess  capacity  on  prices,  and  threatened 
the survival of the Petro-states. Thus, greater cartel discipline was imposed on pro-
duction,  and  increases  in  production  are  designed  to  keep  pace  with  demand,  while 
keeping excess capacity at relatively low levels (<1–2Mbbl/day). 
Since  man-made  and  natural  disruptions  to  oil  supply  routinely  eliminate 
∼600,000  bbls/day,  the  net  available  excess  supply  is  low  enough  to  create  market 
scarcity  for  the  commodity,  raising  prices.  The  ongoing  conflict  in  Iraq,  the  threat 
of  terrorism,  weather  related  disruptions,  and  the  normal  disruptions  from  the  un-
stable oil producing countries all create a risk-premium for the commodity that can 
raise  the  price  from  $5–$7/bbl.  Once  any  commodity  prices  trend,  technical  traders 
enter  that  commodity  market,  raising  prices  even  further.  The  impact  of  technical 
trading may be adding from $8–$10/bbl to the current market prices. 

Thus,  the  more  demand  grows  at  the  rapid  rates  we  have  experience  in  recent 
years, the more prices will remain high. This increased price will occur not because 
producers need these prices to provide new supplies into the market, but rather be-
cause  the  producers  are  able  to  sustain  these  prices  by  not  adding  more  capacity 
than necessary to just meet market demand. 

Therefore, we cannot expect oil producers to alleviate prices over the long run. In-

stead, we must turn to demand. 

Question 1b. How much will demand increase? 
Answer.  The  increase  in  oil  demand  depends  on  three  factors:  economic  growth, 
business  and  consumer  technology  choices,  and  government  policies.  Until  very  re-
cently,  the  world  has  been  largely  de-linking  its  energy  demand  from  GDP  growth, 
thereby  reducing  energy  intensity  (energy  use/GDP).  This  trend  has  just  changed, 
as  the  recent  rapid  demand-growth  from  China  re-coupled  this  ratio.  The  sobering 
reality  is  that  instead  of  0.4  percent  energy  growth  to  realize  a  1  percent  increase

in  GDP,  the  global  ratio  has  risen  to  0.8  percent—worse  than  we  were  before  the 
1970’s Oil Crisis. The historical trend can be seen in the following chart, where the 
(red)  line  and  right-hand  scale  shows  the  ratio  of  global  energy  growth  to  global 
GDP growth (the bars are simply the raw growth data): 

Demand for oil was 77 Mbbl/d in 2001 and reach 84 Mbbl/d in 2005. If we remain 
on current course, the IEA projects oil demand to rise to an extraordinary 121 Mbbl/ 
d in 20 years. Fifty-eight percent of the incremental demand for oil is caused by the 
United States, China, India, and emerging Asia. By 2025, U.S. demand is projected 
to grow by 8.7 Mbbl/d, while China’s demand will grow by 7.8 Mbbl/d. The demand 
for oil in Europe and Japan is projected to be relatively flat and even declining. 

The  degree  of  demand-response  to  higher  prices  will  largely  determine  the  ulti-
mate  disposition  of  the  oil  markets  and  prices,  far  more  than  increases  in  supply. 
There  is  considerable  system  inertia  at  a  global  level  due  to  the  time  required  to 
turn  over  the  transportation  capital  stock,  but  the  actions  of  the  U.S.,  China,  and 
India  will  determine  whether  global  demand  for  oil  stabilizes  and  then  falls,  or 
whether  demand  continues  to  rise  unabated.  As  Pogo  said,  ‘‘We  have  met  the 
enemy, and it is us.’’ 

As  our  study,  Winning  the  Oil  End  Game 1 showed,  the  U.S.  has  the  ability  to 
reduce  its  demand  by  more  than  50  percent  of  projected  use  from  efficiency  alone, 
and  up  to  75  percent  if  the  biofuels  substitution  potential  is  fully  tapped.  This  is 
summarized,  with  proper  capital  stock  turnover  accounting,  in  the  following  chart:

This  transition  could  occur  within  as  little  as  10  years  from  inception.  Our  mod-
els,  which  have  been  calibrated  and  vetted  with  DOE,  predict  that  U.S.  demand 
could be lower than current demand within 10 years, and then decline significantly 
thereafter.  The  demand-inertia  due  to  the  existing  capital  stock  creates  the  time 
delay.  The  technologies  required  to  produce  the  demand-shift  already  exist  and 
could be easily commercialized. 

However,  despite  the  surge  in  consumer  interest  in  hybrids  due  to  high  gasoline 

prices, there is still a need for government action. 

Why  don’t  consumers  ‘‘act  rationally’’  to  invest  in  efficiency  and  alternatives? 
Aside from facing a highly volatile price of fuel, the short answer is that market fail-
ures prevent the investments from occurring. To accelerate the transition away from 
oil,  it  is  possible,  and  necessary,  to  deploy  a  portfolio  of  policy  that  firmly  fixes  the 
current market failures. 

The  four  key  market  failures  that  prevent  the  billions  of  decisions  made  by  mil-
lions  of  marketplace  participants—manufacturers  and  consumers—from  rationally 
allocating capital investment to oil efficiency are: 

i. A mismatch between individual consumers’ high implicit discount rates (often 
upwards  of  60  percent  p.a.  real)  and  the  much  lower  real  rates  of  society  as  a 
whole  (OMB  recommends  3.2  percent  p.a.  for  Federal  energy  savings).  This 
leads to grossly suboptimal individual investment decisions in efficiency; 
ii.  Limited  information  conveniently  available  to  busy  buyers  and  manufactur-
ers  about  their  choices  in  using  oil  far  more  efficiently  constitute  an  informa-
tion-failure for both parties on just how much end-use efficiency is available and 
at what real cost; 
iii.  The  gap  between  pump  prices  and  total  societal  costs  for  oil  constitute  a 
price  signal  failure,  as  petroleum-based  fuel  prices  faced  by  the  individual  con-
sumer at the pump are below the true cost, society in fact pays for these fuels; 
and 
iv. The cultural and organizational challenges for big organizations such as the 
Big 3 automakers to deal with the onslaught of disruptive technologies for rad-
ical  fuel  efficiency  (as  illustrated  by  their  now  being  years  behind  Japanese  ri-
vals in effiency-doubling hybrid-electric propulsion) constitute a failure to orga-
nize and reorganize large entities. 

A  policy  portfolio  that  immediately  fixes  the  four  key  market  failures  and  enables 
the  U.S.  to  solve  its  oil  problem  should  also  accelerate  the  pace  of  bringing  alter-
native fuels to the marketplace. 

Fixing  the  four  critical  market  failures  will  optimize  innovation  and  its  rate  of 
adoption  among  users,  and  will  also  optimize  the  rate  of  capital  stock  turnover.  To 
fix  the  failures,  only  a  modest  policy  portfolio  would  be  required.  This  portfolio

should  also  be  market-oriented  without  taxes,  innovation-driven  without  mandates, 
and  doable  administratively,  even  at  the  State  level.  Whether  implemented  at  the 
state or Federal levels, this policy portfolio 2 should also be consistent over time, es-
pecially  with  regards  to  stimulating  adoption  of  continuously  improving  technology. 
At  the  Federal  level,  a  simple  and  highly  effective  policy  portfolio  would  fix  the 

market failures via the following instruments: 

a. Fix the discount, rate, and information failures by embedding efficiency infor-
mation  in  purchase-prices  for  cars  and  light  trucks,  and  do  so  via  size-and  rev-
enue-neutral  feebates.  This  instrument  combines  fees  on  inefficient  models  with 
rebates on efficient ones. These are calculated separately within each size class, 
so one isn’t penalized for choosing an SUV, but rewarded for choosing a efficient 
SUV  and  charged  a  fee  for  choosing  an  inefficient  one.  The  revenue-neutral 
structure  means  that  each  year  the  fees  pay  for  the  rebates.  Such  feebates 
broaden the price spread within each size class, in such a way that private buy-
ers will consider the entire lifecycle fuel savings of their vehicle choice, not just 
the first 2–3 years, yielding a societally efficient decision. Feebates speeds inno-
vation in efficiency since it applies a constant incentive for continuous adoption 
of  efficiency  and  a  disincentive  for  inefficiency,  without  reducing  customer 
choice. Feebates will also increase automakers’ profits. 
b.  Create  a  new  million-a-year  car  market  for  efficient  vehicles  by  leasing  effi-
cient  new  cars  to  low-income  customers  and  scrapping  inefficient  clunkers,  thus 
providing affordable personal mobility—the last frontier of welfare reform. Low- 
income  families  lack  affordable  mobility,  so  creatively  financing  super-efficient 
and reliable new cars would expand low-income employment, and create a prof-
itable  new  million-car-a-year  market  for  advanced-technology  vehicles  sold,  or 
leased,  to  customers  who  previously  weren’t  credit-worthy  enough  to  buy  new 
vehicles.  This  mechanism  would  work  well  within  the  current  private-sector 
automobile financing structure. 
c. Ensure ‘‘energy-smart’’ military and government procurement of the hundreds 
of thousands of civilian vehicles purchased each year, thus speeding innovation 
and reducing automaker risks. 
d.  Share  R&D  risk  between  military  and  civilian  sectors  by  asking  the  Depart-
ment of Defense to accelerate advanced materials and their manufacturing devel-
opment to meet its own objectives of a light, agile, and fuel-efficient force struc-
ture to protect troops and fuel supply lines, and to save billions (ultimately tens 
of  billions)  of  dollars  per  year  in  avoided  fuel  logistics  costs,  to  enhance  force 
protection,  and  to  free  multiple  divisions  of  people  who  now  haul  and  protect 
fuel, thus permitting major tail-to-tooth realignments. 
e.  End  the  perverse  incentive  in  the  lower  48  states  (all  but  OR  and  CA)  where 
gas  and  electric  distribution  utilities  are  rewarded  for  selling  more  energy  and 
penalized for cutting customers’ bills. 
f.  If  the  government  is  to  support  domestic  industries,  then  it  should  promote 
innovation-friendly  policies  like  temporary  Federal  loan  guarantees  (structured 
to  cost  the  Treasury  nothing),  to  help  automakers  retool  and  retrain,  and  help 
airlines to buy efficient airplanes while scrapping inefficient ones. 
g.  Finally,  similar  support  should  be  made  for  investment  in  domestic  carbo-
hydrate  energy  infrastructure  that  migrates  the  main  feedstock  from  hydro-
carbons to carbohydrates. Our study also recommends a $1-billion DARPA ‘‘fly- 
off’’  to  accelerate,  by  roughly  a  decade,  learning  about  which  of  the  competing 
cellulosic ethanol conversion process most merit rapid scale-up by private inves-
tors. 

Question 1c. What demonstrable effects do you believe the imposition of a 27-mile- 

per-gallon CAFE standard will have? 

Answer.  The  demonstrable  effect  would  be  marginal.  Compared  to  doing  nothing, 
the  small  effect  from  imposing  a  27  mile  per  gallon  CAFE  standard  would  result 
from  marginally  reducing  demand  for,  and  therefore  the  price  of,  petroleum  fuels 
and  crude  oil.  The  effect  on  demand  will  initially  be  small  and  would  gradually  ac-
cumulate  as  the  effect  percolates  into  the  capital  stock  via  the  natural  turnover 
cycle. 

Based on a quick estimate made in the time available to write up these answers, 
the reduction in demand in the first year of full impact would be between about 0.09

and  about  0.14  million  barrels  per  day,  or  between  0.4  percent  and  0.7  percent  of 
current U.S. oil consumption. 

After this change works its way through the entire capital stock once, roughly 12– 
18  years  from  now,  the  savings  would  be  between  1  and  2  million  barrels  of  crude 
a day, compared to doing nothing between now and 2020. Compared to doing noth-
ing  and  compared  to  a  forecasted  2020  oil  use  of  about  24  million  barrels  per  day,3 
this measure will, depending on how it is implemented, eliminate between 4 percent 
and 8 percent of U.S. forecasted oil use in 2020. 

All  numbers,  derivations,  and  assumptions  are  laid  out  in  the  simple  table  on 
page  162.  The  impact  on  the  near-  and  mid-term  price  of  oil  would  likely  be  mod-
erate  in  terms  of  direct  impact  on  the  fundamental  supply-and-demand  balance,  as 
100,000 barrels in the first full year would make but a modest difference. However, 
the  main,  and  more  important  impact  will  probably  come  from  the  signal  that  this 
sends  to  the  market.  This  signaling  effect  could  be  immediate.  Given  today’s  tight 
market,  the  psychological  effect  of  any  sign  that  the  U.S.  is  starting  to  address  the 
root  causes  of  its  high  oil  consumption  could  significantly  soften  prices  and  reduce 
speculative fervor. 

From  our  deep  knowledge  of  automobile  costs,  we  would  expect  this  measure  to 
have a minimal impact on automobile prices. We also expect that most of the bene-
fits would go to the consumer in the form of fuel bill savings. 
Review  of  Relevant  Facts:  How  CAFE  Works,  Vehicle  Sales  Numbers,  and  Vehicle 

Life 4 

For  cars,  the  Corporate  Average  Fuel  Economy  (CAFE)  standards  set  mileage 
standards  at  27.5  mpg  in  1990.  ‘‘Cars’’  are  the  so-called  Class  1  vehicles,  having  a 
Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) of up to 6,000 lbs. 

It  is  of  some  importance  to  note  that  setting  the  standard  for  all  vehicles  at  the 
same  level  of  27  mpg,  which  is  what  the  question  implies,  would  represent  a  de-
crease  in  efficiency  of  cars  by  0.5  mpg—a  move  in  the  wrong  direction.  While  it  is 
unclear whether the question was misstated, we have assumed no change in car effi-
ciency in any of these answers. 

For  light  trucks,  CAFE  set  20.7  mpg  as  the  standard  in  1996.  Light  trucks  are 
vehicles  of  GVWR  between  6,001  and  8,500  lbs,  also  known  as  Class  2a.  The  light 
truck  mileage  standard  was  increased  in  2003  to  21.0  for  Model  Year  (MY)  2005 
light trucks, 21.6 mpg for MY 2006, and to 22.2 mpg for MY 2007. 

The  CAFE  standards  currently  do  not  place  fuel  economy  standards  on  heavier 
light  trucks  of  GVWR  between  8,501  and  10,000  lbs,  also  known  as  Class  2b  vehi-
cles. 5 

It  is  worth  noting  that  these  fuel  economy  standards  are  not  ‘‘real  world  and  on- 
road’’ but instead are idealized and in the lab, and are in fact about 15 percent high-
er  than  actually  achieved  on  the  road.  On-the-road  fuel  economies  for  the  three 
classes have been assumed to correspond to those recently computed, i.e., 24.7, 18.2, 
and  15.7  mpg,  respectively  (all  from  Heavenrich).  Also  noteworthy  is  that  EPA  has 
announced an intention to reduce this test vs. actual gap by some unknown amount. 
The best approximate sales estimates for model year (MY) 2005 cars is about 8.6 
million and for light trucks (Class 2a) about 8.5 million. The best estimate for Class 
2b light trucks is for MY 2001, and is 0.93 million. 

Vehicle duration, or vehicle life, varies somewhat depending on the type of vehicle 
class,  but  based  on  data  from  Oak  Ridge  National  Labs  a  rough  average  figure  of 
13 years is appropriate as a point estimate. 

With average mpg for each main vehicle class, the number of vehicles sold in each 
class  in  a  year,  and  with  the  average  life  of  all  cars,  we  have  made  the  following 
very rough estimates of the impact to U.S. oil use. 
Estimates of Impact of 27 mpg Fuel Economy Standard 

The  estimates  of  fuel  savings  have  a  range,  because  the  answer  depends  on  how 

the policy measure is applied. 

The  savings  will  be  lower  if  the  27  mpg  measure  is  applied  just  as  an  in-lab  re-
quirement  and  if  the  measure  is  applied  to  light  trucks  only  (Class  2b)  and  such 
that these merely ‘‘catch up’’ to cars, and thus continuing to exclude Class 2b vehi-
cles from CAFE regulations. A 27 mpg standard applied in this way and only to ve-

hicles  below  8,500  lbs  is  labeled  ‘‘Weak  27  MPG’’  in  the  summary  table  below,  and 
would: 

(i)  Slightly  worsen  the  fuel  economy  standard  for  cars  from  27.5  to  27.0  mpg 
(assumed to be negligible in table below and excluded from results); 
(ii)  Increase  the  fuel  economy  standard  for  light  trucks  from  22.2  to  27.0  mpg; 
and 
(iii) Do nothing to Class 2b trucks. 

The  savings  will  be  higher  if  it  is  applied  to  all  vehicles  below  10,000  lbs  and  if 
applied  as  an  on-the-road  MPG  requirement  (i.e.,  not  as  a  lab-based  requirement). 
Applying the 27 mpg standard in this way to all vehicles below 10,000 lbs is labeled 
‘‘Strong 27 MPG’’ in the table above. 

As  shown  in  the  table,  the  reduction  in  demand  in  the  first  year  of  full  impact 
would be between about 0.09 and about 0.14 million barrels per day, or between 0.4 
percent and 0.7 percent of current U.S. oil consumption. 

After this change works its way through the entire capital stock once, roughly 12– 
18  years  after  the  year  when  the  measure  takes  full  effect,  the  savings  would  be 
between 1 and 2 million barrels of crude a day, compared to doing nothing between 
now  and  2020.  Compared  to  doing  nothing  and  compared  to  a  forecasted  2020  oil 
use  of  about  24  million  barrels  per  day,6 this  measure  will,  depending  on  how  it  is 
implemented,  eliminate  between  4  percent  and  8  percent  of  U.S.  forecasted  oil  use 
in 2020. 

The estimates as well as key assumptions are summarized in the above table. 

Appendix—The  U.S.  Oil  Problem,  Why  a  Focus  on  ‘‘Peak  Oil’’  Misses  the 

Mark, and How To Fix the Current Capital Inefficiency 

The U.S. Oil Problem 

It  is  worth  re-iterating  the  U.S.  oil  problem.  First,  the  U.S.  has  exploited  its  do-
mestic  oil  endowment  more  and  longer  than  any  other  nation,  and  now  has  more 
mature provinces, further along in the depletion cycle, than other suppliers. On the 
margin,  a  barrel  therefore  generally  costs  more  to  extract  at  home  than  to  import. 
Second, the U.S. now uses 26 percent of global oil, but produces only 9 percent and 
owns  only  2–3  percent  of  known  reserves,  so  it  is  not  possible  to  drill  our  way  out 
of  this  problem.  Third,  since  oil  is  a  fungible  commodity  on  a  global  scale,  the  U.S. 
oil problem is not just about how to eliminate imports. 7 

6 http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/aeorefltab.html. Table 2. 
7 President Bush’s Energy Policy, like his father’s, correctly states that the problem is oil use, 

not oil imports.

The  U.S.  oil  problem  correctly  stated  is  therefore  ‘‘How  can  the  U.S.  entirely 

eliminate her use of conventional oil? ’’ 

As described, two key, viable, and more economical alternatives offer the solution: 
1.  Efficient  use  of  oil:  across  all  sectors,  half  the  forecast  2025  U.S.  use  of  oil 
can be saved by redoubled end-use efficiency costing an average of $12/bbl (2000 
$). 
2.  New  energy  carriers  that  are  or  will  be  cheaper  than  oil;  specifically,  ad-
vanced biofuels and substituting saved-natural-gas. 

As our study Winning the Oil Endgame found, both options are robustly competi-
tive  on  the  margin  with  $26/bbl  crude  oil  (EIA’s  January  2004  Reference  Case 
benchmark  for  Refiner’s  Acquisition  Cost,  compared  on  the  short-run  margin,  in 
2000  $  levelized  at  a  5  percent/year  real  discount  rate).  In  other  words,  all  the  oil 
the U.S. uses now, or is officially projected to use in 2025, can be saved or displaced 
more cheaply than buying it, even at half today’s price, and even if all externalities 
associated with its use were worth zero (which they are not). 
Focus on ‘‘Peak Oil’’ Misses the Mark 

Along with important national security dividends and improved productivity from 
efficient capital allocation, the better fundamental economics identified in our study 
are the key underpinnings for doing something about the U.S. oil problem by elimi-
nating its use. Collectively, these reasons also explain why the ‘‘peak oil’’ debate de-
serves far less attention. 

The fact is that nobody can know who is right about peak oil, because the needed 
economic-geology data are either unknown or secret, and is typically held closely by 
sovereign governments, which own ∼94 percent of world oil reserves, are not subject 
to  outside  audit,  and  have  little  reason  to  truthfully  disclose  how  much  oil  they 
have.  The  peak  oil  question  is  therefore  best  classified  as  a  ‘‘known  unknown.’’  It 
is  a  known  phenomenon  in  the  sense  that  withdrawal  of  supplies  of  conventional 
oil eventually will peak. However, the timing of peak oil is unknown. 

As  such,  the  timing  of  peak  oil  dictates  that  the  phenomenon  is  best  considered 
a  risk  to  economic  stability  and  growth,  and,  therefore  an  additional  reason  to  act 
by hedging our bets. The hedge is best created by taking the long view, and via ac-
tive  and  consistent  demand-side  policies  that  smoothly  eliminate  the  need  for  oil 
over  the  next  few  decades.  The  bottom  line  is  that  it  doesn’t  matter  who’s  right 
about  peak  oil,  because  we  should  do  the  same  thing  anyhow—save  or  displace  all 
the  oil  we  use—just  to  make  money.  If  we  get  off  oil  earlier  than  proves  necessary, 
we’ll only make more profit sooner. 
Absence  of  Consistent  and  Significant  Demand-Side  Policy  Will  Prolong  Capital 

Misallocation and Deepen an Economic Crisis 

The  transition  away  from  oil  both  can,  and  will,  happen  eventually,  even  under 
laissez  faire.  However,  as  consumers  are  feeling  today,  that  course  is  unnecessarily 
painful and disruptive, producing gross misallocations of capital and resources, and 
creating  unnecessary  inflationary  pressures.  On  the  supply-side,  because  OPEC’s 
cartel  inverts  normal  market  behavior  by  forcing  costlier  oil  to  be  produced  first, 
more capital than necessary is allocated, and in a way over which the U.S. has little 
control. On the demand-side, insufficient capital is allocated due to the four market 
failures explained in detail above. 

This  sub-optimal  allocation  of  capital  on  both  sides  of  the  supply-demand  spec-
trum produces a relatively, very wasteful and inefficient set of capital allocation de-
cisions.  Moreover,  of  the  two  sides,  the  U.S.  has  relatively  little  real  control  over 
the  global  and  OPEC-driven  supply  side,  but  is  clearly  in  a  better  position  to  sys-
tematically and consistently exercise influence on the demand side. 

Under laissez faire, optimal capital allocations to oil savings and substitutions are 
therefore postponed, resulting in wild scrambles when prices soar, and encouraging 
hasty, ill-considered policy choices to be repented at leisure. 

A  consistent  and  active  public  policy  approach  to  the  demand-side  would  fix  the 
four  market  failures  described  above,  and,  thereby,  ensure  that  decisions  about 
when, where, and which oil-using capital equipment are bought are rationally made 
via access to information and the proper and up-front price signals for oil-using cap-
ital  purchases,  thus  ensuring  societal  capital  efficiency  and  therefore  also  optimal 
capital productivity. 

While recent prices of $60–$70 per barrel of conventional oil could help elicit use-
ful  savings  and  substitutions,  an  optimal  price  level  would  cause  minimal  inflation 
while maximizing the pace of expansion of demand-side and oil-substituting supply-

side  alternatives.8 While  some  may  argue  this  would  indicate  that  recent  oil  prices 
have been ‘‘too high,’’ the explanation is rather that the U.S. capital stock has long 
experienced an underinvestment in oil efficiency.9 The policy stagnation that caused 
improvements in vehicle efficiency to slow to a trickle, and even reverse, during the 
late 1980s and early 1990s, now impose a heavy burden at the gas pump. 

Fixing  the  market  failures  will  optimize  the  pace  of  the  demand-side  infrastruc-
ture transition by accelerating that transition. Unless the failures are fixed, the cur-
rent  pain  being  felt  by  consumers  is  probably  a  small  taste  of  what  is  to  come.  De-
velopment  and  consumer  adoption  of  alternatives  to  oil  before  prices  potentially 
spike much higher will help mitigate any future pain, inflationary or otherwise. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. TED STEVENS TO 

JOHN H. SEESEL 

Question.  The  last  four  years  we  have  observed  unprecedented  fluctuation  of  the 
energy  markets.  These  fluctuations  have  been  exploited  and  exacerbated  by  specu-
lators. Federal law stipulates that excessive speculation can create volatility and es-
tablishes  limits  to  prevent  extreme  speculation.  The  Commodity  Futures  Exchange 
Commission  is  the  independent  government  agency  responsible  for  the  oversight  of 
futures  trading.  Should  the  CFTC  be  more  aggressive  in  ensuring  that  this  market 
is  not  being  exploited  by  speculators?  Do  you  believe  that  there  should  be  greater 
margin requirements for speculators to pay prior to a purchase in the petroleum fu-
tures market? 

Answer.  The  Federal  Trade  Commission  has  neither  the  information  nor  the  ex-
pertise  to  determine  whether  the  CFTC’s  oversight  of  the  futures  markets  is  ade-
quate. Accordingly, I am not in a position to offer an opinion on whether the CFTC 
should be more aggressive in its efforts to contain speculation or on whether margin 
requirements  should  be  increased.  Because  the  CFTC  has  primary  jurisdiction  in 
this area, I would respectfully defer to the CFTC’s judgment on these issues.1 

I  deeply  appreciate  your  concern  about  competition  and  consumers  in  petroleum 
markets,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  respond  to  your 
questions. Please let me know whenever the FTC may be of further assistance.

8 In  the  12  months  to  September  2005  the  U.S.  saw  a  Consumer  Price  Index  (CPI)  rate  rise 
of  4.7  percent,  largely  driven  by  the  rise  in  energy  prices,  primarily  oil  but  also  natural  gas. 
The  month  of  September  2005,  saw  the  biggest  increase  in  the  Labor  Department’s  Producer 
Price Index in 15 years. The PPI, which measures prices at the wholesale level, rose 1.9 percent 
in  September,  on  high  energy  and  food  costs,  reflecting  a  6.9  percent  year-over-year  rise  that 
was the sharpest in 15 years. With energy and food removed, ‘‘core’’ PPI rose 0.3 percent, illus-
trating the significance the recent energy price rise has had (food has been relatively constant). 
Although  1  month  of  data  does  not  signify  a  trend,  the  gain  in  inflation  raises  some  concerns 
that oil and gas prices are stoking broad-based inflationary pressures. 

9 ‘‘Underinvested’’  because,  even  though  the  U.S.  has  doubled  its  oil  productivity  since  1975, 
half the oil it uses is still wasted when compared with today’s best efficiency technologies, cost-
ing  an  average  of  $12  per  saved  barrel  (in  2000  $).  Light-vehicle  efficiency,  for  example,  has 
generally been getting worse for over 20 years, and EIA’s January 2004 Reference Case, forecast 
that it would spend the next 20 years getting only 0.5 mpg better than it was in 1987. 

1 As with my oral responses to the Committee’s questions at the September 21 hearing, these

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN INSTITUTE 
Dear Senator Snowe: 
As  promised  during  Rocky  Mountain  Institute’s  testimony  to  your  Committee  on 
21  September  2005,  we  are  pleased  to  provide  a  list  of  measures,  each  of  which 
would  have  a  significant  effect  of  reducing  U.S.  demand  (and  therefore  reducing 
prices) for conventional petroleum products, and to do so over a time frame ranging 
from  overnight,  to  over  the  next  several  weeks  and  months,  and  to  generally  do  so 
with either a stimulative or a neutral effect on the economy. Overall, the measures 
would  add  up  to  between  a  5  percent  and  9  percent  reduction  in  the  U.S.  demand 
for conventional crude oil over the next year or so, and do so with little or no inter-
ruption of our way or quality of life. These immediate measures are listed in the fol-
lowing pages. 

A  5  percent  to  9  percent  reduction  in  U.S.  crude  oil  demand  may  not  sound  like 
a  lot.  However,  due  to  a  current  tightness  in  the  market  that  is  of  historic  propor-
tions,  this  reduction  would  have  a  disproportionate  effect  in  stabilizing  the  market 
price.  This  is  because  a  reduction  in  U.S.  demand  of  5  percent  to  9  percent  would 
be  sufficient  to  bring  the  global  demand  level  down  by  some  1.0  to  1.8  million  bar-
rels per day, or some 1.2 percent to 2.1 percent of global oil consumption. This quan-
tity  is  sufficient  to  give  the  fundamental  global  demand  and  supply  oil  system 
enough excess capacity to be able to absorb future price shocks caused by real risks 
such  as  terror-  or  weather-related  interruptions,  and  thereby  take  a  lot  of  air  out 
of speculation as well. The fundamentals today are simply so tight that such shocks 
cannot  be  absorbed  without  severe  price-rises.  Excess  capacity  of  some  3.0  to  3.5 
million  barrels  a  day  is  required  for  a  stable  fundamental  demand  and  supply  bal-
ance—in  turn  providing  stable  prices—yet  only  some  1.5  to  2.0  million  barrels  per 
day  of  excess  capacity  exists  today.  By  removing  roughly  1.0  to  1.8  million  barrels 
of  daily  oil  demand  from  the  market,  the  reduction-measures  suggested  below, 
would bring excess capacity back to a level of 2.5 to 3.8 million barrels per day, and 
would,  therefore,  bring  the  currently  high  oil  price  levels  and  price  volatility  levels 
back to levels of a few years ago.

As important additional signaling measures, immediate and aggressive pursuit of 
commercialization  of  cellulosic  ethanol  and  feedstock-neutral  biodiesel  would  imme-
diately  improve  the  situation,  due  to  its  signal  to  the  world  market  that  the  U.S. 
is  on  course  to  diversify  its  mobility  fuels.  There  are  many  longer-term  measures 
that  will  take  time  before  the  real  effect  if  felt,  but  whose  signals  will  send  strong 
messages that will also provide an immediate effect and stabilize the market. These 
are well elaborated on in the Policy section in our September 2004 book titled Win-
ning  the  Oil  Endgame,  free  at  www.oilendgame.com,  and  would  all  work  to  signal 
a  coherent  policy  intention  that  would  address  the  root  causes  of  a  ‘‘U.S.  oil  prob-
lem’’  that  extends  well  beyond  U.S.  borders,  since  the  U.S.  consumes  25  percent  of 
global oil output. 

We  now  describe  the  short-term  measures  that  would  together  reduce  U.S.  crude 

oil demand by between 5 percent and 9 percent, possibly more. 
Part I: Immediate Measures To Reduce Consumption 
I. Gasoline Only: Eliminate About 4–8 Percent of U.S. Gasoline, or Roughly 2–4 Per-

cent of Crude 

Reduce  speed  limits  for  all  non-Class  8  vehicles  to  60  MPH  in  zones  above  this 
limit today on all roads under Federal (and, if possible, state) jurisdiction. Assuming 
about  1⁄2 of  U.S.  automobile  gallons  are  burnt  at  speeds  of  65  MPH  or  higher,  a 
speed  reduction  from  65  to  60  MPH  would  save  between  8  percent  to  12  percent 
of  those  gallons,  or  some  4  percent  to  6  percent  of  gasoline  fuel  usage,  or  roughly 
2  percent  to  3  percent  of  U.S.  consumption  of  crude  oil.  While  we  understand  that 
this  may  not  be  popular  among  all  constituents,  this  fuel  would  be  immediately 
saved  (overnight).  When  mid-term  measures  kick  in,  it  could  be  phased  out  if  nec-
essary. 

Provide  alternative  fuel  vehicle  (AFV),  hybrid,  and  all-electric  vehicles  access  to 
HOV lanes and preferential parking. At the moment, only AFVs have this right, and 
EPA would need to change its definition to one based on fuel efficiency or emissions, 
not on the fuel used, to make the rules embrace hybrids on Federal highways. Some 
states are already trying to do so but need the EPA rule change. 

Give  so-called  double-tax-credit  to  state  and  local  nonprofit  vehicle  buyers,  such 

as public safety agencies, for going to high-efficiency hybrids. 

Encourage improved pattern of use by enabling all citizens to deduct their yearly 

cost of mass transit on IRS Schedule A. 

Ensure  that  ‘‘parking  cash-out’’  is  approved,  and  consider  requiring  it  for  large 
employers,  as  long  practiced  in  S.  California.  Under  this  system,  employers  must 
give their employees the option of cashing out of the free parking space they other-
wise  would  have  been  able  to  claim  (alternatively,  employers  cannot  give  free  em-
ployee  parking,  but  must  charge  fair  market  value  and  pay  a  ‘‘commuting  allow-
ance’’  of  equal  after-tax  value  to  employees  choosing  to  commute).  This  monetizes 
competition  between  all  modes  of  getting  to  work  (or  not  needing  to,  e.g.,  telecom-
muting);  workers  who  choose  any  cheaper  mode  than  driving  their  own  car  can 
pocket  the  difference.  Both  the  Treasury  and  employers  gain  net  revenue  too.  This 
was approved, but we have not had time to check if it were superseded. 

Extend  the  Federal  tax  credit  for  AFV,  hybrid,  and  all-electric  vehicles  to  a  sig-

nificantly greater number of vehicles than the current 60,000 per manufacturer. 

Fix >8,500-lb loophole in current CAFE standard, so that the heavier light trucks 

(Class 2b) will have to comply with the MPG standards. 

Clarify that NHTSA does have authority to extend to cars its 23 August 2005 pro-

posed decision, to base future CAFE light-truck rules on size, not weight. 
II.  Diesel  Only:  Eliminate  About  12–18  Percent  of  Diesel,  or  Roughly  1–2  Percent  of 

Crude 

Reduce  heavy  truck  speed  limit  to  55  MPH  on  all  roads  under  Federal  (and,  if 
possible, state) jurisdiction. Over a typical heavy truck driving cycle, this would save 
between  5  percent  and  10  percent  of  heavy  truck  diesel  savings,  or  roughly  3  per-
cent  to  6  percent  diesel  savings,  translating  to  roughly  0.5  percent  to  1.0  percent 
of crude savings. Please note that as long as this applied to all Class 8 trucks across 
the  nation,  truckers  would  know  that  the  playing  field  is  level,  and  would  be  happy 
to  take  the  saved  fuel  money.  The  labor  costs  would  go  up  marginally,  but  truckers 
and trucking fleets would prefer to get this through provided it is applied uniformly 
across the country. 

Introduce three measures to eliminate between 8 percent, and, possibly more than 
12 percent of domestic heavy truck diesel, or some 5 percent to 7 percent of all die-
sel,  and  therefore  about  1  percent  of  all  U.S.  crude  oil  use,  via  reduced  number  of 
trips  and  reduced  fuel  waste  from  upstream  bottlenecking  in  international  ship-
ments (due to the lowest GWVR often occurring in the United States):

• Raise  Federal  Gross  Vehicle  Weight  Rating  (GWVR)  to  the  European  norm  of 
110,000  lbs,  while  leaving  the  per-axle  weight  requirements  unchanged.  Truck-
ers  would  simply  add  one  extra  axle  on  trailers  to  allow  rigs  to  carry  more 
weight without increasing the pressure on the roadways. This should be accom-
panied  by  installation  of  sufficient  braking  power  (optionally  using  better  tech-
nologies, possibly disk brakes) so that braking power per pound of GWVR would 
at  minimum  remain  constant.  Since  pressure  on  the  road  surface  remains  the 
same  per  axle  and  brake  force  per  pound  is  easily  retained  or  improved,  this 
measure  will  not  damage  roads.  Moreover,  when  combined  with  lower  speed 
(above),  safety  would  in  all  circumstances  be  better.  Please  note  that  there  is 
no  real  reason  not  to  do  this;  maintaining  status  quo  will  perpetuate  U.S.  lack 
of  competitiveness.  Please  also  carefully  note  that  when  combined  with  the 
speed-reduction  measure,  this  GVWR  measure  will  more  than  offset  (by  many 
whole-number  multiples)  any  capacity  losses  to  the  U.S.  stock  of  trucks.  This 
point is very important. 

• Allow  double  and  triple-trailer  combinations  nationwide  (currently  allowed  in 
e.g., NY, AZ, UT, and other states). The fuel savings are simple and self-explan-
atory:  one  tractor  pulling  two  48-foot  trailers  will  pull  roughly  double  the  load 
while reducing fuel economy from 6.5 mpg to roughly 5.0 mpg. So this measure 
means  pulling  the  second  load  at  a  ‘‘penalty’’  of  only  about  1.5  mpg,  versus 
today having to pull this second load with an altogether separate tractor at 6.5 
mpg. 

• Change  Federal  regulation  of  tractor  and  trailer  maximum  height  from  13.5  to 
14  ft,  and  trailer  length  from  53  to  59  ft  (note  that  some  states  have  already 
done this) to enable more cargo volume per trip for those loads that are cubed- 
out. 

Some states permit the first two measures already (e.g., Michigan allows 160,000 
lbs  and  triple-trailers).  This  measure  would  improve  truckers’  margins  from  three 
key factors: the 8–12 percent direct diesel savings, some 20–35 percent direct capital 
expenditure  savings,  and  reduced  cost  by  lowering  the  extremely  high  driver  turn-
over  in  the  industry.  Since  additional  axles  can  be  rapidly  and  safely  retrofitted  to 
generate  an  immediate  effect,  one  suggestion  would  be  to  introduce  a  temporary 
waiver with immediate effect. Truckers will embrace this package so far. But please 
read on for more initiatives that truckers will embrace if implemented on a Federal 
level. 

Mandate  heavy  truck  manufacturers  to  install  Auxiliary  Power  Units  (APUs)  on 
all new Class 8 tractors. This will represent a level playing field between manufac-
turers and between all customers, and this will eliminate ∼8–9 percent of truck die-
sel fuel (4–5 percent of all diesel). This reduction is because of a reduction in diesel 
going  to  idling  by  ∼90  percent,  or  about  0.5–0.7  percent  of  U.S.  crude  oil  use  when 
fully  implemented,  or  about  0.03–0.07  percent  after  the  first  year.  Please  note  that 
because  this  measure  would  affect  new  tractors,  little  to  no  lead-time  is  required. 
The  other  point  to  note  is  that  the  payback  is  very  favorable,  so  it  is  a  measure 
that  trucking  companies  will  be  happy  to  take  as  mandatory  if  uniformly  applied. 
Incentivize  retrofits  on  existing  trucks  of  APUs  via  a  nationwide  tax  incentive 
(like for hybrid cars), for example a tax credit, phased down to reward early adopt-
ers,  and  offset  initially  higher  costs  before  volumes  expands.  This  will  also  imme-
diately eliminate the confusion that currently exists between state boundaries. 

Require  installation  of  a  digital  fuel  economy  display  to  give  real-time  efficiency 
data to operators. This has been shown to result in increased efficiency through on- 
the-job learning about which driving regime gives high vs. low fuel economy. 

Require driver’s ed for fuel economy by making efficiency training required for ob-

taining a Class A CDL. 

The  trailer  manufacturing  sector  today  has  nothing  enforced  on  it:  vendors  build 
a big box that’s not at all aerodynamic. This industry should be put under pressure 
by  an  independent  rating  system.  This  system  should  reward  low-aerodynamic  re-
sistance trailers and should penalize high-aerodynamic resistance trailers. 

Rapidly  mandate  efficiency  (coefficient-of-rolling-resistance)  labeling  for  truck 

tires, so truckers can be informed. 

Examine  the  idea  of  disallowing  passing  on  fuel  surcharges  among  the  mega- 
fleets. Currently, large for-hire mega-fleet purchasers of trucks need not absorb the 
high  costs  of  fuel,  as  they  simply  add  fuel  surcharges  to  their  customer’s  bills.  If 
fuel  surcharges  are  disallowed,  these  important  large-scale  fleets  will  immediately 
turn to the manufacturers and request from them mass-production trucks with sig-
nificantly  lower  aerodynamic  resistance,  since  aerodynamic  resistance  ‘‘eats’’  about 
2⁄3 of all heavy truck diesel.

Improve  the  EPA  methods  of  regulating  emissions  from  heavy  trucks,  by  elimi-
nating  the  current  compromise  between  fuel  economy  and  emissions  regulations. 
This  is  probably  too  late  for  2007,  but  should  be  understood  and  re-examined  for 
the  upcoming  additional  regulatory  tightening  that  is  due  in  2010.  This  is  a  tech-
nical area but will be fruitful to discuss in depth with the EPA, as regulatory path-
ways  different  from  the  current  one  appear  to  be  possible.  One  possibility  is  to  ask 
EPA  to  phase-in  NOx regulations  as  technologies  that  don’t  sacrifice  fuel  economy 
come to market (the current Exhaust Gas Recirculation deployed by engine makers 
will cost truckers about 5 percent fuel economy as of 2007). 

We recommend a CBO or GAO study or studies of the low-income affordable-per-
sonal-mobility  financing  options  described  in  detail  in  our  book,  Winning  the  Oil 
Endgame. This is politically a very attractive and private-sector funded mechanism 
that  would  also  be  very  attractive  to  Detroit.  It  should  be  politically  attractive  to 
show something is being done to relieve, in due course, $3/gal gasoline’s heavy bur-
den on low-income Americans. 
III.  Gasoline  and  Diesel:  Eliminate  About  4–6  Percent  of  Gasoline  and  Diesel,  or 

About 2–3 Percent of Crude 

Procure  with  immediate  effect  all  Federal  road-based  civilian  vehicles,  and  state 
or  local  vehicles  purchased  with  Federal  funds,  including  those  of  DOD,  such  that 
they  are  among  the  5  percent  most  efficient  vehicles  in  their  sub-class.  There  are 
6  sub-classes  of  automobiles  (Class  1),  6  sub-classes  of  light  trucks  (Class  2a),  and 
then  there  are  Class  2b  (8,501–10,000  lbs)  and  Classes  3  through  8  (up  to  80,000 
lbs GVW). 

Proper  tire  inflation  pressure  can  give  up  to  a  3  percent  fuel  economy  benefit 
(some  0.4  percent  per  psi  under-inflated).  Owners  will  need  strong  encouragement 
that  all  individuals  and,  in  particular,  rental  vehicle  fleet  companies  go  through 
their entire set of wheels and ensure that tire pressures are what each tire specifies 
as maximum pressure. 

Exert  Federal  pressure  to  improve  timing  of  traffic  lights  on  major  streets  in  cit-
ies.  The  benefits  are  unequivocally  positive,  and  include  improved  traffic  flow,  re-
duced  oil  use,  and  reduced  pollution.  It  would  not  be  hard  to  implement,  and  it  is 
surprising  that  this  isn’t  more  widely  adopted.  While  the  Federal  Government  does 
not control this, it could commission studies of the potential savings from this action 
at  (say)  the  state  level,  and  experiments  at  the  local  level  by  placing  funding  for 
such  studies.  A  few  studies  and  experiments  in  some  big  states  (California  and 
Texas for example) would catalyze copycat activities in other states. Once the anal-
ysis shows the potential benefits and some localities report their results, others will 
soon follow. The Federal Highway Administration has a lot of expertise in this area. 
A useful carrot could be some encouragement or incentive, while traffic-light timing 
is being adjusted, to retrofit the signals themselves with LED models that save en-
ergy,  have  better  visibility,  and  last  far  longer.  The  saved  maintenance  cost  can 
then pay for other costs, such as changing signal timing or introducing smarter on- 
ramp ‘‘metering’’ lights, that would otherwise burden state and local highway budg-
ets. 

Push  rapid  adoption  of  both  electronic  toll  taking  technologies  and  ‘‘urban  box’’ 
congestion charges. Based on experience from London, Oslo, and other cities, signifi-
cant  local  savings  of  oil  will  result  from  lowered  congestion  and  improved  traffic 
flow.  Consider  subsidized  adoption  or  withholding  Federal  funds  from  states  that 
don’t  make  it  a  priority.  Compatibility  should  be  encouraged  between  regions,  and 
privacy concerns should be addressed. 

Encourage proper engine tuning. 
Encourage proper air filter replacement. 
All  of  EPA’s  gas  mileage  tips  may  be  good  to  widely  publicize,  such  as  ‘‘Driving 

more efficiently.’’ See EPA sites for more information: 

http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/maintain.shtml, and 
http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/drive.shtml 

Ask NHTSA to clarify that dealers and vendors of hybrid cars are allowed to give 
advice on how to drive these cars for maximum fuel efficiency, as lawyers currently 
argue that this would be illegal since it goes beyond, and adds a gloss to, the EPA- 
required  MPG-label.  This  is  important  for  hybrids  because  Consumer  Reports,  N.Y. 
Times, and others use a standard test method that disadvantages hybrids, creating 
a  false  public  impression  that  hybrids  inherently  fall  short  of  their  EPA-rated  mpg 
by  more  than  non-hybrids  do—yet  automakers  can’t  educate  testers  or  customers 
about how to drive hybrids optimally.

IV.  Jet  A:  Eliminate  About  1  Percent  of  Jet  A  in  First  Year,  or  Roughly  0.1  Percent 

of Crude 

169 

Have FAA mandate idling on one engine only when aircraft is on ground-hold (i.e., 

sitting on tarmac awaiting take-off). 

Introduce  loan  guarantees  (offset  by  equity  warrants  so  there’s  no  actuarial  net 
cost to the Treasury) for airlines wishing to scrap and replace parked and inefficient 
with  efficient  planes  such  as  the  new  Boeing  787  Dreamliner.  Note  condition  of 
scrapping.  A  minimum  proven  efficiency  gain  (e.g.,  20  percent)  per  passenger  mile 
should be a condition. An even better instrument would be to offer loan guarantees 
whose  amount  depended  on  the  difference  in  fuel  economy  between  what  is  being 
scrapped and the new aircraft. This would align the incentive with the desired out-
come—saved  fuel.  This  would  allow  airlines  to  trade-up  to  more  efficient  airplanes 
by  either  scrapping  one  of  their  older  planes,  or  buying  one  off  the  market  to  be 
scrapped,  replacing  it  with  a  more  efficient  plane  that  meets  certain  specifications. 
Introduce  a  phased-down  tax-credit  to  airlines  that  replace  heavy  interior  parts 
with lightweight materials (e.g., seats, tray tables, etc, all being easily retrofittable). 
A useful number to know is that for a typical midsize passenger jet, taking out one 
lb of weight saves 124 lbs of fuel per year. 
Part II: Increase in Supply 

Require  Federal  Government  procurement  agency  [GSA]  to  sign  long-term  con-
tracts for biofuel blends E85 for up to 30 percent of their fuel requirements. A major 
issue  preventing  increased  biofuel  capacity  is  the  inability  to  finance  plants  due  to 
lack  of  long-term  fuel-purchase  contracts.  Use  government  procurement  to  address 
this bottleneck. 

Expand  the  renewable  fuel  loan  guarantee  in  Section  1511  of  the  2005  Energy 

Policy Act, to allow for more than 50 projects rather than the current 4. 

Encourage automakers to go total-flex. Over half of all Brazil’s new cars are now 
total  flex  (heading  for  85  percent  in  the  next  few  years).  Other  countries  are  intro-
ducing  this,  e.g.,  Sweden  (www.baff.info).  Total-flex  technology,  pioneered  by  GM 
and  VW  in  Brazil,  lets  a  car  burn  anything  from  pure  gasoline  to  pure  ethanol. 
Since  no  specific  fuel  or  blend  is  required,  and  the  cars  adjust  on  the  fly,  there  are 
no  captive  customers;  when  you  pull  up  to  the  pump,  you  can  buy  whatever  fuel 
or  blend  is  cheapest  that  day.  This  has  been  the  most  important  reason  Brazilian 
ethanol now competes robustly against gasoline without subsidy. As a result, Brazil 
has already replaced over one-fourth of its gasoline with sugar-cane ethanol; has re-
covered  its  initial  ethanol  subsidies  50  times  over  from  oil  savings;  and  lands  eth-
anol in New York for $1.10/gallon after paying 100 percent duty. 

Propose  a  DARPA  fly-off  between  10  competing  cellulosic  ethanol  plants:  pay  to 
build  each,  and  protect  intellectual  property  rights  while  gaining  transparency  in 
data. 

Senator,  should  you  have  any  questions  about  this  list,  please  do  not  hesitate  to 

get in touch. Thank you.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. GEORGE ALLEN TO 

JIM WELLS 

Question  1.  Mr.  Wells,  in  your  report,  you  stated  that  the  variety  of  fuel  blends, 
over 50, in the United States, has contributed to price volatility. In the Energy Pol-
icy Act of 2005, we stopped the proliferation of additional fuel blends. How practical 
would  it  be  to  ratchet  down  the  amount  of  fuel  blends  to  a  more  reasonable  and 
efficient  number?  What  number  would  be  effective?  Would  the  use  of  the  cleanest 
fuels increase or decrease short-term and long-term costs? 

Answer.  Our  recent  work  on  special  gasoline  blends  entitled  Gasoline  Markets: 
Special Gasoline Blends Reduce Emissions and Improve Air Quality, but Complicate 
Supply  and  Contribute  to  Higher  Prices  (GAO–05–421),  did  not  extend  far  enough 
to make specific recommendations about the optimal number of fuel types. Further, 
to our knowledge, there has not yet been any study comprehensive enough to satis-
factorily  answer  this  question.  With  regard  to  the  short-term  and  long-term  costs 
of switching to only the cleanest fuels, we reported that these fuels are also the cost-
liest  to  produce.  In  addition,  not  all  refineries  can  produce  these  fuels  without  in-
stalling  costly  equipment  and  processes.  Finally,  oil  company  officials  told  us  that 
switching  to  these  fuels  can  reduce  total  refining  capacity,  because  these  fuels  can-
not  use  some  components  derived  from  crude  oil  that  are  currently  blended  into 
some  types  of  fuel.  Therefore,  to  determine  the  optimal  number  of  fuels  types  and

170 

the  costs  of  switching  to  the  cleanest  fuels,  we  would  need  to  do  an  analysis  of  the 
available  refining  capacity  capable  of  producing  these  fuels,  and  also  evaluate, 
among  other  things,  how  refining  capacity  would  be  affected  by  switching  to  fewer 
fuel types. 

Question  2.  Two  important  facts  stand  out  with  respect  to  the  Nation’s  refining 
capacity:  First,  47  percent  of  the  Nation’s  refining  capacity  is  in  the  Gulf  Coast  re-
gion.  And,  second,  we  have  heard  of  only  one  new  refinery  being  developed  since 
the  mid-1970s—it  is  in  Yuma,  Arizona.  In  your  view,  what  additional  steps,  both 
direct  and  indirect,  can  Congress  take  to  facilitate  the  construction  of  new  refinery 
capacity?  In  addition,  is  it  possible  to  secure  greater  geographic  diversity  of  refin-
eries so that we do not have a repeat of the problems caused by Hurricane Katrina? 
Answer.  Clearly,  the  damage  caused  by  Hurricane  Katrina  has  pointed  out  the 
concern related to having a refining industry heavily concentrated in a specific geo-
graphic area. It is also true that no new refineries have been built since the 1970s, 
although there has been some increase in refining capacity through additions to ex-
isting refineries. GAO has not done any work that would enable us to suggest what 
steps  Congress  can  take  to  facilitate  construction  of  new  refineries.  With  regard  to 
securing  greater  geographic  diversity  of  refineries,  while  we  have  not  analyzed  this 
question  in  any  of  our  past  work,  we  can  point  out  two  features  of  the  oil  industry 
that may be helpful as Congress considers these issues. First, the heavy concentra-
tion  of  refineries  in  the  Gulf  Coast  Region  is  mirrored  by  a  concentration  of  crude 
oil supply infrastructure as well as infrastructure for delivering petroleum products 
from the Gulf to consuming regions. If significant new refining capacity were located 
elsewhere  in  the  country  it  may  be  necessary  to  also  build  additional  crude  oil  and 
petroleum product infrastructure, including pipelines and storage terminals. Second, 
in the course of our work we have been told many times by industry representatives 
and  other  industry  experts  that  state  and  local  permitting  requirements  and  other 
constraints  are  discouraging  new  refinery  and  other  infrastructure  development.  If 
Congress  believes  that  adding  new  refining  and  related  infrastructure  to  create 
greater  geographic  diversification  is  desirable,  then  addressing  these  issues  may  be 
justified. 

Question 3. How can the refinery permitting process be streamlined to encourage 
greater capacity at existing sites? Are there current regulations that are duplicative 
and unnecessary to achieve reasonable environmental goals? 

Question 4. Which of these regulations deserve permanent suspension or modifica-

Answer to Questions 3 and 4. GAO has not analyzed the refinery permitting proc-
ess in our past work, so we cannot directly answer these questions. We have studied 
the  siting  of  electric  power  plants  in  a  report  entitled  Restructured  Electricity  Mar-
kets: Three States’ Experiences in Adding Generating Capacity (GAO–02–427). While 
we do not know if the permitting process for capacity expansions of refining is simi-
lar  to  that  of  power  plant  siting,  in  the  aforementioned  report,  we  found  that  Fed-
eral,  state,  and  local  jurisdictions  were  all  involved  in  the  power  plant  approval 
process  and  that  there  was  a  great  deal  of  variation  in  the  amount  of  time  it  took 
to  gain  approval  to  build  power  plants  within  states  and  also  across  the  states. 
Based on the results of this work, a similar study of the permitting process for refin-
ing capacity upgrades may be fruitful. 

Question  5.  Has  the  temporary  relaxation  of  Federal  fuel  requirements,  such  as 

tion? 

sulfur content, helped alleviate the gasoline crisis? 

Answer.  In  our  report  on  special  gasoline  blends  we  concluded  that  the  prolifera-
tion  of  these  blends  has  put  stress  on  the  supply  infrastructure  and  likely  led  to 
higher prices. While we did not analyze specific supply disruptions such as occurred 
in  the  aftermath  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  we  can  infer  from  our  work  that  relaxing 
Federal  fuel  requirements  in  general  would  lead  to  fewer  complications  in  supply 
and probably to reduced industry costs and lower prices at the pump. It is also log-
ical to infer that relaxing these requirements would allow some areas access to gaso-
line  and  other  fuels  that  would  otherwise  not  be  allowed  and  therefore  would  have 
been unavailable. In this way it is likely that relaxing the Federal fuel requirements 
did help alleviate gasoline price increases at least in some areas. 

Question 6. Has the trend of running our refineries at high levels, like 97 percent, 
and  the  failure  to  build  more  refineries  undermined  the  effectiveness  of  the  Stra-
tegic Petroleum Reserve? 

Answer. GAO is currently conducting a review of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve 
(SPR).  In  the  course  of  this  work  we  are  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  the  SPR. 
We  cannot  at  this  point  answer  the  question  generally,  but  we  can  point  out  that 
Hurricane  Katrina  did  damage  both  to  crude  oil  supply  in  the  Gulf  Coast  and  to 
refineries  and  pipelines.  In  such  a  situation,  the  damage  to  refining  capacity  may 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  15:23 May 10, 2011 Jkt 066218 PO 00000 Frm 00174 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\66218.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

171 

have reduced the industry’s ability to use SPR oil, and, thereby decreased the effec-
tiveness  of  the  SPR.  If  this  is  true,  then  in  similar  situations  in  the  future,  having 
additional refining capacity could increase the potential to use SPR oil. 

Question  7.  Over  the  past  20  years,  is  it  true  that  demand  for  refined  products 
has increased by about 30 percent and capacity has only increased about 9 percent? 
Answer.  According  to  data  compiled  by  the  Energy  Information  Administration, 
petroleum  consumption  in  the  United  States  increased  by  over  50  percent  in  the 
twenty years from 1985 through 2004, while domestic refining capacity increased by 
about 8 percent over the same period. However, because the rate at which capacity 
was used also increased, the total volume of refined products produced by U.S. refin-
ers rose by almost 30 percent over the same twenty-year period. The difference was 
made up by imports. 

Question  8.  Did  Europe’s  dieselization  program  affect  incentives  to  add  refinery 
capacity? Are there other examples of other country’s fuel choice decisions that have 
affected our markets and refinery capacity? 

Answer.  We  recently  testified  that  as  demand  for  gasoline  has  grown  faster  than 
domestic  refining  capacity,  the  United  States  has  imported  larger  and  larger  vol-
umes  of  gasoline  and  other  petroleum  products  from  refiners  in  Europe,  Canada, 
and  other  countries.  One  reason  for  this  increase  in  imports  has  been  the  avail-
ability  of  gasoline  from  these  foreign  sources  at  lower  cost  than  building  and  oper-
ating  additional  refining  capacity  in  the  United  States.  While  we  have  not  studied 
other countries fuel choice decisions and their potential impact on our markets and 
refinery capacity, it is reasonable to infer that, if other countries move toward using 
more  diesel  and  less  gasoline,  this  would  lead  to  greater  opportunities  for  the 
United States to import those other countries’ surplus gasoline. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

J. ROBINSON WEST 

Question  1.  In  testimony  before  the  U.S.  Senate  Committee  on  Foreign  Relations 
October  2003,  you  said  that  ‘‘There  is  misplaced  concern  with  ‘dependence’  on  for-
eign  oil  suppliers . . . ‘Energy  independence’  in  the  U.S.  is  a  meaningless  concept. 
. . .’’ Do you believe that the U.S. can and should be dependent on foreign oil? 

Answer. It is inevitable that the U.S. is dependent on foreign oil in the sense that 
oil  is  a  fungible  commodity  traded  in  a  liquid,  transparent,  and  efficient  market. 
That  is  why  there  is  a  global  price  for  oil.  It  would  be  preferable  if  the  U.S.  were 
to import less oil since there would be less impact on foreign exchange and current 
account  balances  and  the  possibility  of  interruption  of  supply  would  be  diminished. 
Question  2.  In  testimony  before  the  U.S.  Senate  Committee  on  Foreign  Relations 
October  2003,  Mr.  West  called  Saudi  Arabia  the  ‘‘central  bank  of  oil,’’  saying  ‘‘The 
excess  capacity  that  Saudi  Arabia  maintains  at  high  cost  allows  the  world  markets 
not  to  panic  at  every  incident,  civil  war  or  revolution.  Without  it,  there  would  be 
cyclical  booms  and  busts  which  would  destabilize  economies  and  countries.  Saudi 
Arabia is the guarantor of last resort, the Central Bank of the oil market that pro-
vides  liquidity  and  reassurance  in  difficult  times.’’  In  an  interview  with  Margaret 
Warner  of  PBS’  NewsHour  in  2003,  when  talking  about  Iraq  you  said  that  ‘‘oil  al-
ways  corrupts  governments 
. . .  if  a  government  controls  oil,  large  oil  resources, 
they  basically  don’t  need  the  consent  of  the  governed.  They  have  the  money.  . . . 
And government becomes not only a political prize, but it becomes a great commer-
cial and financial prize. And this is what’s happened in West Africa, in the Caspian, 
and  the  Middle  East,  and  Russia,  everywhere.  Do  you  consider  Saudi  Arabia  one 
of these governments that control the oil without full consent of their governed? 

Answer.  Saudi  Arabia  is  a  monarchy  and  not  a  democracy.  Obviously,  it  would 
be  better  if  there  were  greater  participation  of  the  public  in  government  decisions, 
including the control of oil. That being said, Saudi Arabia under King Abdullah has 
made some tentative steps in increasing public participation. Also, it is a firmly held 
view  that  Saudi  Aramco  itself  is  one  of  the  best  national  oil  companies;  highly  pro-
fessional and not corrupt. 

Question 3. The U.S. uses 26 percent of the world’s oil, but owns only 2–3 percent 
of it. According to Winning the Oil Endgame, written by the Rocky Mountain Insti-
tute, ‘‘after 145 years of exploitation, U.S. reserves are mostly played out’’ and ‘‘the 
Arctic  National  Wildlife  Refuge  (ANWR),  the  biggest  onshore  U.S.  oil  prospect,  is 
estimated  by  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  to  average  3.2  billion  barrels—enough  to 
meet  today’s  U.S.  oil  demand  for  6  months  starting  in  a  decade.’’  The  GAO  tells  us 
that  supply  in  the  U.S.  is  dwindling,  and  that  any  oil  we  extract  now  will  be  more

difficult to get, because we’ve essentially picked the low-hanging fruit. How does de-
mand play into our long-term problems with supply? 

Answer.  As  I  noted  in  my  testimony,  supply  solutions  by  themselves  will  not  be 
adequate.  We  must  approach  demand  seriously  thru  increased  efficiency  and  con-
servation, particularly in the transportation sector. 

Much  of  our  imported  oil  comes  from  countries  with  unstable  political  situations. 
Given this restricted supply, many believe the only long-term solution is a demand- 
side  one,  i.e.,  drastically  reducing  the  U.S.’  dependence  on  oil,  both  foreign  and  do-
mestic.  The  Commerce  Committee  has  jurisdiction  over  a  major  U.S.  policy  that 
could sharply reduce U.S. demand for oil—Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) 
standards.  Transportation’s  need  for  light  refined  products  such  as  gasoline  causes 
93 percent of projected growth in oil demand to 2025, according to the Rocky Moun-
tain Institute and the Energy Information Administration.

Question 1. It is our understanding that some over-the-counter futures trading do 
not  fall  under  the  purview  of  the  CFTC.  Is  this  true?  What  trades  are  under  the 
purview of CFTC and which are not? 

Answer.  We  have  not  published  any  work  that  would  enable  us  to  answer  this 
question  directly.  However,  we  are  conducting  ongoing  work  that  relates  to  these 
issues  and  in  the  course  of  this  work,  we  will  try  to  incorporate  information  that 
would  answer,  at  least  in  part,  Question  1.  When  this  work  is  released  we  will  en-
sure that you and your staff receive copies of the report. The broad objectives of our 
ongoing work include the following questions: 

1. To what extent have market studies, including those carried out by the CFTC 
and  the  New  York  Mercantile  Exchange,  explored  possible  relationships  be-
tween  the  level  and  volatility  in  energy  futures  prices  and,  (a)  general  market 
factors, and (b) the trading activities of hedge funds? 
2. How does the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) market sur-
veillance  program  monitor  and  detect  market  abuses  in  the  trading  of  energy 
futures? 
3.  What  enforcement  actions  has  CFTC  taken  against  energy  traders  involving 
fraudulent, manipulative, and abusive trading practices? 

five  companies 

Question  2.  According  to  CRS, 

(ExxonMobil,  BP,  Shell, 
ChevronTexaco,  and  ConocoPhillips)  now  represent  81  percent  of  the  market-based 
revenues for this industry. They have also calculated that net income for these com-
panies  grew  from  $29.7  billion  to  $81.5  billion  between  2002  and  2004,  and  profits 
as  a  percent  of  revenues  for  these  companies  grew  from  4.4  percent  in  2002,  to  6.7 
percent  in  2003,  to  7.1  percent  in  2004.  This  past  quarter,  the  following  companies 
reported the following earning increases: ExxonMobil up 32 percent to $7.64 billion; 
Shell  up  35  percent,  to  $5.34  billion;  BP  up  29  percent,  to  $5.66  billion; 
ConocoPhillips up 51 percent, to $3.14 billion. Please provide you opinion of the de-
gree  to  which  the  large  vertically  integrated  companies  control  the  distribution  of 
gasoline,  direct  pricing  to  retail  outlets,  and  limit  distribution  to  dealers  not  com-
plying with direction from the major companies. 

Question  3.  Against  the  background  included  in  Question  2,  what  is  the  GAO’s 
current  assessment  of  the  competitive  nature  of  today’s  gasoline  market,  in  light  of 
the  large  profits  being  reaped  by  the  oil  companies,  and  their  apparent  lack  of  in-
vestment  in  growing  refining  capacity?  What  measures  are  used  to  assess  the  com-
petitiveness of the refining industry, the retail gasoline industry? 

Answer  to  questions  2  and  3.  GAO  does  not  have  published  work  that  would  en-
able  us  to  directly  answer  these  questions.  However,  we  do  have  a  recent  report, 
entitled  Energy  Markets:  Effects  of  Oil  Mergers  and  Market  Concentration  in  the 
U.S.  Petroleum  Industry,  in  which  we  found  that  mergers  in  the  1990s  contributed 
to an increase in the market concentration of the petroleum industry. We also found 
that  some  of  these  mergers  contributed  to  increases  in  gasoline  prices,  averaging 
about  1  to  2  cents  per  gallon.  We  do  not  have  work  that  would  enable  us  to  com-
ment more generally about the competitiveness of the refining industry. Further, as 
we  testified,  the  petroleum  industry  is  global  in  nature  and  the  United  States  cur-
rently imports a large amount of gasoline to supplement domestic refining capacity. 
Because  of  its  global  nature,  we  believe  that  a  more  complete  study  is  needed  of 
the  competitiveness  of  the  petroleum  industry;  the  investment  climate  for  building 
new  refining  capacity,  worldwide;  the  role  and  availability  of  imported  gasoline  in

meeting U.S. demand; and the implications of these things on gasoline prices in the 
United States. 

Question 4. It has been suggested that the oil futures market is a significant con-
tributor  to  the  recent  increase  in  crude  oil  prices.  While  the  Commodities  Futures 
Trading Commission is responsible for oversight of the oil futures market, we solicit 
your  opinion  as  to  whether  any  gaps  in  oversight  authority  exist.  Specifically,  I’d 
like  to  understand  whether  all  over-the-counter  trades  are  included  in  regulatory 
oversight authority. 

Question 5. Do you believe the FTC and CFTC have sufficient authority to inves-
tigate market manipulation, price-gouging, and price volatility? What if any changes 
would you recommend Congress adopt? 

Answer  to  questions  5  and  6.  Questions  4  and  5  relate  to  our  aforementioned  on-
going work (see our answer to Question 1). While that work is at an early stage and 
we do not at present have any findings to share, we will try to incorporate informa-
tion into our report that will, at least in part, answer Questions 5 and 6. 

Question  6.  Some  independent  gas  station  owners  in  my  state  have  complained 
that they are not supplied with as much product as they want at any one time, ne-
cessitating  more  frequent  deliveries.  Do  you  know  if  this  a  standard  market  prac-
tice?  What  is  the  volume  capacity  of  all  the  gas  stations  in  the  country  combined? 
Could  having  a  higher  percentage  of  them  filled  allow  for  a  cushion  during  sudden 
supply shortages? 

Answer.  In  our  recent  gasoline  primer,  entitled  Motor  Fuels:  Understanding  the 
Factors that Influence the Price of Gasoline, we discuss the role of inventories in de-
termining gasoline prices. We have also reported that, like inventory levels in many 
other industries, the level of gasoline inventories held by private companies has de-
creased  significantly  in  recent  years.  This  could  have  an  impact  of  gasoline  prices 
in  the  event  of  unforeseen  disruptions  as  occurred  with  Hurricane  Katrina.  Specifi-
cally,  having  more  inventories  in  the  aftermath  of  the  hurricane  would  likely  have 
alleviated  some  of  the  shortages  that  were  reported  at  some  gasoline  stations  and 
could have mitigated some of the price increases. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

JOHN H. SEESEL 

I am pleased to respond to the questions that you have asked following up on the 
September 21, 2005, hearing on energy pricing before the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation.1 

In response to your questions, I would like at the outset to identify some common 
themes,  which  are  discussed  more  fully  in  the  answers  below.  First,  a  requirement 
that firms disclose certain types of company-specific information might in fact harm 
competition and consumers, as well as entail significant costs both for industry and 
for  the  government.  Second,  the  top  five  firms  identified  by  the  Congressional  Re-
search  Service  do  not  dominate  the  petroleum  industry  as  a  whole  or  in  any  of  its 
stages (such as crude oil production, refining, transportation, or retailing). Third, oil 
industry profits have not been consistently high and have fluctuated widely over the 
past  three  decades,  depending  on  underlying  economic  conditions.  Finally,  unlike 
agencies with mandates to monitor and govern aspects of the pricing and output of 
regulated industries, the Federal Trade Commission’s enforcement authority is lim-
ited  to  offenses  against  the  antitrust  and  consumer  protection  laws,  and  that  au-
thority is also circumscribed by applicable judicial decisions. The FTC is not an eco-
nomic regulatory body. 

Question  1.  In  the  spirit  of  enhanced  market  transparency,  why  doesn’t  the  FTC 
issue  regulations  requiring  full  disclosure  by  refiners  and  distributors  of  their 
wholesale motor fuel pricing policies, where full disclosure is a listing of each compo-
nent  contributing  to  prices,  including  the  cost  of  crude  oil,  refining,  marketing, 
transportation, equipment, overhead, and profit, along with portions of any rebates, 
incentives, and market enhancement allowances? 

Answer.  As  a  general  principle,  increased  transparency  is  a  laudable  goal  for 
many markets. The availability of timely, accurate information about the character-
istics  of  a  market  is  an  important  element  of  sellers’  and  buyers’  ability  to  make 
intelligent supply and consumption decisions. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, 

1 As  with  my  oral  responses  to  the  Committee’s  questions  at  that  hearing,  these  answers 
present my personal views and do not necessarily represent the views of the Federal Trade Com-
mission or of any individual Commissioner.

it  is  difficult  to  see  how  the  additional  transparency  proposed  here  would  signifi-
cantly help consumers, while there are ways in which they may be worse off. 

First, it is not clear that new regulations would offer consumers new information 
that  they  can  use.  Petroleum  markets  already  are  more  transparent  than  many 
other  markets.  Consumers  are  acutely  aware  of  prominently  posted  retail  gasoline 
prices and can far more readily compare the asking prices of competing gasoline re-
tailers than the prices of such goods as new cars or computer equipment. 

The proposal’s focus on wholesale motor fuel pricing policies suggests that it may 
be  primarily  concerned  with  wholesale  buyers,  such  as  jobbers  and  various  outlets 
that  sell  gasoline  (for  example,  convenience  store  chains,  supermarkets,  and  mass 
merchandisers). These wholesale buyers already rely on many kinds of sophisticated 
information,  such  as  posted  terminal  rack  prices,  NYMEX  spot  prices  for  crude  oil 
and refined products, additional petroleum industry information available from such 
commercial  sources  as  Platts  and  the  Oil  Price  Information  Service,  and  highly  de-
tailed data that the Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes about every 
sector of the petroleum industry. 

Second, requiring the posting of detailed cost information could actually raise gas-
oline  prices  by  facilitating  collusion.  Detailed,  firm-specific  cost  and  profit  informa-
tion  could  facilitate  the  management  of  a  successful  price-fixing  cartel,  by  helping 
the cartel members to coordinate pricing and supply decisions and to identify firms 
that  cheat  on  the  collusive  arrangement.  Any  government  agency  placed  in  charge 
of compelling industry competitors to disclose this information essentially would as-
sume the role of cartel facilitator.2 

Third,  producing  the  information  and  administering  the  disclosure  regulations 
may  impose  substantial  costs.  Depending  on  how  wholesale  sales  are  defined,  the 
number of reporting companies may be sizable. 3 Many cost elements—such as crude 
oil costs and spot and rack prices—vary daily (if not more often) and would require 
constant updating. The mandated information would require reporting on wholesale 
prices  at  hundreds  of  terminal  racks  across  the  nation,  involving  thousands  of  job-
bers  that  buy  at  the  rack  and  tens  of  thousands  of  retailers  that  are  directly  sup-
plied on a DTW basis. Very substantial resources might be required to identify with 
regularity  all  of  the  constantly  changing  contractual  terms  between  refiners  and 
these  myriad  firms  and  to  report  on  transportation  costs,  fixed  costs,  and  profits. 
It could be very expensive for the firms to produce these additional data and costly 
for  the  responsible  government  agency  to  oversee  the  program.  Indeed,  if  such  dis-
closures  are  to  be  required,  I  respectfully  suggest  that  the  EIA  and  other  compo-
nents of the Department of Energy—which already perform a significant amount of 
petroleum  industry  data  collection  and  analysis—would  be  far  better  positioned 
than  a  law  enforcement  agency  such  as  the  FTC  to  administer  this  regulatory  pro-
gram. 

Question 2. In the August 2004 report on The Petroleum Industry: Mergers, Struc-
tural  Change,  and  Antitrust  Enforcement,  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  ‘‘alleged 
that  since  1981,  15  large  petroleum  mergers  would  have  resulted  in  significant  re-
ductions in competition and would have harmed consumers in one or more relevant 
markets  had  the  mergers  proceeded  as  announced.  In  11  cases,  the  FTC  obtained 
significant divestitures, including the sales of numerous refineries, pipelines, termi-
nals  and  marketing  assets  to  prevent  reductions  in  competition  and  harm  to  con-
sumers.’’ While the FTC placed conditions or requirements such as asset divestiture 
and/or  orders  actions  precluding  the  emerging  parties  from  undertaking  anti-
competitive  price  increases,  the  outcome  is  the  current  situation  where  the  market 

2 Some economic studies have concluded that the mandated disclosure of firm-specific informa-
tion  on  prices  and  contract  terms  may  have  abetted  noncompetitive  behavior  in  some  cir-
cumstances.  See  S.  Albaek,  P.  M<llgaard,  and  P.B.  Overgaard,  Government-Assisted  Oligopoly 
Coordination? A Concrete Case, 45 J. Indus. Econ. 429 (1997) (publication of firm-specific trans-
action  prices  by  Danish  antitrust  authority  associated  with  15  to  20  percent  increases  in  con-
crete  prices);  see  also  S.W.  Fuller,  F.J.  Ruppel,  and  D.A.  Bessler,  Effect  of  Contract  Disclosure 
on Price: Railroad Grain Contracting in the Plains, 15:2 Western J. Agric. Econ. 265 (1990) (leg-
islation requiring disclosure of certain contract terms associated with higher rail rates for grain 
shipments). 

3 For example, according to recent discussions between the staffs of the FTC and the EIA, ap-
proximately 170 entities appear to report to the EIA as ‘‘prime suppliers’’ of gasoline. The EIA’s 
prime  suppliers  are  firms  that  produce  or  import  product  (either  across  state  lines  or  from  for-
eign  sources)  and  sell  the  product  to  jobbers,  retailers,  or  end-users  within  a  state.  These  sales 
sometimes are referred to as ‘‘first sales into state’’ and represent the first change in title after 
the  product  is  either  produced  or  brought  into  a  state.  These  sales  either  explicitly  represent 
wholesale  transactions  if  they  are  made  at  terminal  racks  or  on  a  dealer  tankwagon  (DTW) 
basis,  or  implicitly  represent  wholesale  transactions  in  instances  of  internal  company  transfers 
to company-owned-and-operated retail outlets.

place is controlled by few companies. Please provide the specific indicators or meas-
ures that FTC uses to analyze how consumers benefit from 80 percent control of the 
petroleum market by five of the large vertically integrated companies. 

Answer.  I  gather  from  the  staff  of  the  Committee  that  the  80  percent  figure  at 
the end of this question is derived from Tables 2, 5, and 6 in the Congressional Re-
search  Service’s  August  4,  2005  report  entitled  Oil  Industry  Profits:  Analysis  of  Re-
cent Performance. It appears that the 80 percent figure represents the revenues and/ 
or profits of the top five firms listed in Table 2 divided by the revenues and/or prof-
its  of  the  firms  listed  in  all  three  tables.  These  three  tables,  however,  include  only 
a  small  number  of  the  significant  firms  in  the  petroleum  industry,  and  the  top  five 
firms in Table 2 represent much less than 80 percent of industry revenues and prof-
its when all of the relevant firms are considered.4 

The  top  five  firms  in  Table  2  also  control  much  less  than  80  percent  of  each  of 
the industry’s stages (including crude oil exploration and production, refining, trans-
portation,  terminaling,  wholesale  distribution,  and  retailing).  For  instance,  data 
published  by  the  EIA  show  that  the  top  five  refiners  accounted  for  51.5  percent  of 
crude oil distillation capacity in the United States as of January 1, 2005.5 The 2004 
FTC staff report on petroleum mergers shows the generally unconcentrated or mod-
erately  concentrated  structure  of  the  stages  of  the  industry,  including  Herfindahl- 
Hirschman Indices 6—generally calculated on a national basis 7—of 297 for crude oil 
in  2002;  1,225  for  crude  oil  pipelines  in  2001;  728  for  refineries  in  2003  (with  mod-
erate levels of concentration in refining on a regional basis); 698 for refined product 
pipelines in 2001; and, with few exceptions, low to moderate levels of concentration 
in gasoline marketing (calculated state-by-state). 

More important, the FTC can challenge a merger only to the extent that it is like-
ly  to  substantially  lessen  competition  in  one  or  more  carefully  delineated  relevant 
markets—a likelihood that it must prove to a court. The courts are unlikely to coun-
tenance  a  merger  challenge  based  on  a  theory  that  the  overall  petroleum  industry 
is allegedly experiencing a long-term trend toward consolidation. 

Question  3.  According  to  CRS,  five  companies  (Exxon  Mobil,  BP,  Shell,  Chevron 
Texaco,  and  Conoco  Phillips)  now  represent  81  percent  of  the  market  based  reve-
nues  for  this  industry.  They  have  also  calculated  that  net  income  for  these  compa-
nies  grew  from  $29.7  billion  to  $81.5  billion  between  2002  and  2004,  and  profits  as 
a percent of revenues for these companies grew from 4.4 percent in 2002, to 6.7 per-
cent in 2003, to 7.1 percent in 2004. This past quarter, the following companies re-
ported  the  following  earning  increases:  Exxon  Mobil  up  32  percent  to  $7.64  billion; 
Shell up 35 percent, to $5.34 billion; BP up 29 percent, to $5.66 billion; Conoco Phil-
lips  up  51  percent,  to  $3.14  billion.  Please  explain  how  these  increasing  rates  of 
profit compare to other FTC-regulated industries. 

Answer.  As  discussed  in  Answer  2,  the  five  named  firms  account  for  a  much 
smaller  share  of  industry  revenues.  As  to  the  levels  of  profits  in  the  petroleum  in-
dustry,  both  the  2004  petroleum  merger  report  and  the  FTC’s  July  2005  report  on 
Gasoline Price Increases: The Dynamic of Supply, Demand, and Competition provide 
comparisons  between  profits  in  the  petroleum  industry  and  those  in  other  indus-
tries. Most of the data in these two FTC reports came from the EIA’s Financial Re-
porting  System  (FRS),  although  some  of  the  data  in  Gasoline  Price  Changes  came 
directly from individual firms’ financial reports. The FRS data show that in 2003— 
the  latest  year  for  which  such  EIA  data  are  available—the  28  major  energy  pro-
ducers  currently  operating  in  the  United  States,  had  an  average  return  on  capital 

4 For instance, other large crude oil production firms with which the major integrated compa-
nies must compete—such as state-owned firms in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia, Mexico, and Ven-
ezuela—are not listed in Table 2, and a number of large independent retailers (such as RaceTrac 
and  Sheetz)  are  not  listed  in  Table  6.  Moreover,  the  ratio  erroneously  compares  the  revenues 
of  the  largest  integrated  firms—consisting  of  exploration  and  production,  transportation,  refin-
ing, and marketing, not to mention such additional sources as solar energy, hydrogen, and food 
and  drink  sold  at  retail  outlets—with  revenues  of  selected  non-integrated  refiners  and  market-
ers. 

5 EIA, Petroleum Supply Annual 2004, Vol. 1, Tables 38 and 40. 
6 The  Herfindahl-Hirschman  Index  (HHI)  is  a  measure  of  market  concentration  that  is  cal-
culated  by  squaring  the  market  share  of  each  firm  in  the  market  and  then  summing  those 
squares.  The  Horizontal  Merger  Guidelines  that  the  FTC  and  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice 
apply  in  analyzing  mergers  and  acquisitions  characterize  a  market  with  an  HHI  below  1,000 
as ‘‘unconcentrated,’’ while a market with an HHI between 1,000 and 1,800 is ‘‘moderately con-
centrated’’ and one with an HHI over 1,800 is ‘‘highly concentrated.’’ 

7 In  its  analysis  of  mergers  and  acquisitions  in  the  petroleum  industry,  the  Commission  gen-
erally has found relevant geographic markets to have been less than national in scope. See FTC 
Bureau  of  Economics,  The  Petroleum  Industry:  Mergers,  Structural  Change,  and  Antitrust  En-
forcement 15 (2004). Accordingly, the ‘‘national’’ HHIs in this paragraph are simply an effort to 
estimate concentration in a hypothetical national market.

employed  of  12.8  percent,  as  compared  to  a  10  percent  return  on  capital  employed 
for  the  overall  Standard  &  Poor’s  (S&P)  Industrials.  Between  1973  and  2003,  how-
ever,  the  annual  average  return  on  equity  for  FRS  companies  was  12.6  percent, 
while  it  was  13.1  percent  for  the  S&P  Industrials.  Average  annual  rates  of  return 
for  FRS  companies  have  varied  widely  over  the  years,  ranging  from  as  low  as  1.1 
percent to as high as 21.1 percent during the period from 1974 to 2003. 

Petroleum  firms  have  realized  large  earnings  in  the  last  year  or  two.  In  light  of 
the  sharply  higher  prices  in  the  world  market  for  crude  oil  during  that  period,8 as 
well  as  the  widely  acknowledged  tightness  of  U.S.  refining  capacity—significantly 
aggravated by the damage done by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita—economic activity 
at  the  crude  oil  production  and  refining  levels  of  the  industry  is  generating  very 
large amounts of revenue, and profits (in dollar terms) have risen commensurately. 
Nonetheless,  in  spite  of  the  petroleum  refining  sector’s  higher  margins  in  the  last 
one  to  2  years—due  in  large  part  to  increases  in  demand  and  significantly  con-
strained  refining  capacity—refining  margins  are  notoriously  cyclical  and,  as  noted 
above, fluctuated dramatically over a 30-year period. 

Question  4.  Given  that  five  companies  now  control  more  than  80  percent  of  the 
market, what measures are used to assess the competitiveness of the gasoline indus-
try?  Please  address  the  degree  to  which  the  large  vertically  integrated  companies 
control  the  distribution  of  gasoline,  direct  pricing  to  retail  outlets,  and  limit  dis-
tribution to dealers not complying with direction from the major companies. 

Answer. With respect to the assertion that five companies now control more than 
80  percent  of  the  market,  I  would  note  that  the  FTC  assesses  the  competitiveness 
of any industry by reviewing HHIs, entry barriers, competitive effects, and the com-
petitive  landscape  as  a  whole.  I  would  emphasize  that  the  FTC’s  decades-long  pro-
gram of examining petroleum industry mergers and acquisitions has generated legal 
challenges  to  transactions  in  this  industry  at  lower  levels  of  market  concentration 
than in other industries. 

With regard to vertical integration in the industry, the FTC staff’s 2004 petroleum 
mergers  report  concluded  that  vertical  integration  between  levels  of  the  industry 
has in fact decreased somewhat in recent years. Vertical integration between crude 
oil  production  and  refining  has  tended  to  decline  for  the  major  oil  companies.  Sev-
eral significant refiners—such as Valero, Sunoco, and Tesoro—have no crude oil pro-
duction.  Dependence  on  internal  crude  production  among  some  of  the  major  inte-
grated oil companies also has declined, particularly in comparison to the 1970s.9 

As  for  integration  between  refining  and  marketing,  the  6-percent  increase  in  na-
tional  rack  sales  between  1994  and  2002—largely  at  the  expense  of  lessee  dealer 
DTW  sales—indicates  that,  on  balance,  vertical  integration  between  refining  and 
marketing has not increased on a national basis in recent years (and may have de-
creased). However, the degree of vertical integration varies regionally, and gasoline 
marketing  on  the  West  Coast  has  been  significantly  more  integrated  than  in  other 
parts of the country—a phenomenon that dates back to at least 1994, before the se-
ries  of  large  petroleum  mergers  that  began  in  1997.  On  the  other  hand,  non-
integrated  retailers,  including  convenience  store  chains  (e.g.,  RaceTrac  and  WaWa) 
and  hypermarketers  (e.g.,  Sam’s  Club  and  Kroger),  have  entered  the  market  in  re-
cent years on the West Coast and throughout the rest of the country. For example, 
according  to  one  estimate,  hypermarkets’  share  of  sales  in  the  State  of  Washington 
increased  from  approximately  1.2  percent  in  1998  to  13.9  percent  by  June  2002. 10 
Question 5. It has been suggested that the oil futures market is a significant con-
tributor  to  the  recent  increase  in  crude  oil  prices.  While  the  Commodities  Futures 
Trading Commission is responsible for oversight of the oil futures market, we solicit 
your  opinion  as  to  whether  any  gaps  in  oversight  authority  exist.  Specifically,  I’d 
like to understand if all over-the-counter trades are included in regulatory oversight 
authority. 

Answer. I am not aware of any gap in regulatory oversight by the Commodity Fu-
tures Trading Commission. Because the CFTC has primary jurisdiction in this area, 
however,  I  would  defer  to  that  agency’s  judgment  concerning  the  breadth  of—and 
any perceived lacunae in—that jurisdiction. 

I  deeply  appreciate  your  concern  about  competition  and  consumers  in  petroleum 
markets and thank you for this opportunity to respond to your questions. Please let 
me know whenever the FTC may be of further assistance.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

ROBERT G. SLAUGHTER 

Question  1.  Mr.  Slaughter,  as  you  know,  significant  growth  in  profits,  price  vola-
tility, and price-gouging are concerns now being expressed about the petroleum mar-
ket. How would you characterize the transparency of the current petroleum market? 
Do you believe market competition can be enhanced if refiners and distributors pro-
vided full disclosure of their wholesale motor fuel pricing policies, where full disclo-
sure  is  a  listing  of  each  component  contributing  to  motor  fuel  price,  including  the 
cost of crude oil, refining, marketing, transportation, equipment, overhead, and prof-
it,  along  with  portions  of  any  rebates,  incentives,  and  market  enhancement  allow-
ances? 

Answer.  Gasoline  prices  are  arguably  the  most  transparent  prices  in  the  market-
place. Sharing cost information of the type suggested could be illegal under antitrust 
law because sharing such information may reduce competition. 

Question  2.  Gasoline  for  Washington  State  is  produced  regionally  primarily  from 
Alaskan  crude  oil.  We  understand  that  crude  oil  purchases  are  made  in  a  global 
marketplace;  however,  gasoline  has  increased  at  a  rate  in  excess  of  that  for  crude 
oil.  The  EIA  and  FTC  have  both  testified  to  Congress  that  the  West  Coast  market 
is  isolated  from  the  rest  of  the  country.  Why  is  Washington  State  paying  a  ‘‘risk 
premium’’  for  gasoline,  when  we’re  in  an  isolated  market?  Usually  being  in  an  iso-
lated  market  is  the  reason  given  for  having  the  highest  gas  prices  in  the  country, 
shouldn’t it be the opposite now? 

Answer.  The  products  in  Washington  State  are  priced  to  compete  with  either  al-
ternative supply or alternative disposition for fuel products. When prices rise on the 
USGC,  product  from  Washington  State  can  be  loaded  onto  vessels  and  shipped  to 
that  market.  The  price  in  Washington  rises  to  reflect  its  alternative  use  of  moving 
to  the  USGC,  where  the  price  was  rising  to  indicate  a  shortage  of  product.  This  is 
analogous  to  the  price  of  plywood  rising  in  Washington  when  there  is  a  hurricane 
in Florida. 

Question  3.  Why  doesn’t  the  oil  industry  utilize  more  long-term  contracts  to  re-

duce price volatility while ensuring a fair return on investment? 

Answer. One question would be, what is a ‘‘fair return’’? It is best to let the mar-
ket  decide  what  a  ‘‘fair  return’’  is,  otherwise  a  misallocation  of  capital  could  result 
either increasing costs unnecessarily or resulting in supply shortages. 

Question  4.  Some  independent  gas  station  owners  in  my  state  have  complained 
that they are not supplied with as much product as they want at any one time, ne-
cessitating more frequent deliveries. Is this a standard market practice? What is the 
volume  capacity  of  all  the  gas  stations  in  the  country  combined?  Could  having  a 
higher  percentage  of  them  filled  allow  for  a  cushion  during  sudden  supply  short-
ages? 

Answer. Holding extra inventory at the gasoline station generates additional costs 
to  the  gasoline  station  owner—who  must  pay  for  inventory  that  is  not  generating 
any income. The cost of carrying that inventory would have to be passed to the mar-
ket or the owner would go out of business. Over time, and in the face of competition, 
station owners have optimized their inventory strategies to supply the market while 
remaining both price competitive and profitable. 

A key thought to keep in mind is that $65/bbl crude price is equal to $1.55/gallon 
(42  gallons  per  barrel)  assuming  100  percent  of  the  crude  is  converted  to  gasoline, 
which  it  is  not.  Add  to  that  the  U.S.  average  excise  and  state  taxes  of  $0.42/gallon 
results  in  $1.97/gallon  gasoline  cost  without  adding  any  cost  for  transporting  the 
crude,  refining  it,  transporting  the  product  and  marketing  it,  let  alone  sustaining 
capital costs and a profit. Given the amount of production and refining capacity that 
is off-line, it is notable that gasoline prices have remained at current market levels.
