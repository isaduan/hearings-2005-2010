CLIMATE  CHANGE  IMPACTS 

ON  THE  TRANSPORTATION  SECTOR 

TUESDAY,  JUNE  24,  2008 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10:33  a.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Daniel  K.  Inouye, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 
The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order. 
This Committee, with its diverse jurisdiction, has a history of ris-
ing  to  meet  climate  change  challenges  by  advancing,  in  a  bipar-
tisan  manner,  legislation  that  will  make  a  difference  in  the  fight 
against  global  climate  change.  Legislation  passed  by  this  Com-
mittee  will  result  in  a  meaningful  reduction  of  fuel  consumption 
and emissions by increasing fuel efficiency standards for American 
cars. 

In addition, the actions of this Committee have strengthened cli-
mate change research programs, addressed ocean acidification, and 
ensured  that  adequate  information  and  data  are  available  to  help 
lawmakers, regulators, and planners, among others, make informed 
decisions and adapt to climate changes. 

Today’s  hearing  regarding  climate  change  impacts  on  the  trans-
portation  sector  is  a  continuation  of  the  Commerce  Committee’s 
work to examine efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the 
transportation sector and determine what role the Federal Govern-
ment should play in encouraging these efforts. 

The  transportation  sector  is  a  major  indicator  of  the  overall  eco-
nomic health of our Nation. Given that fact, it is important to rec-
ognize  that  climate  affects  the  design,  construction,  safety  and  op-
erations, and maintenance of transportation infrastructure and sys-
tems.  For  example,  as  we  will  hear  today,  predicted  increases  in 
precipitation  and  frequency  of  storms  will  impact  our  transpor-
tation  systems;  recent  flooding  in  the  Midwest  resulted  in  sub-
merged highways and railroad bridges, and significant diversion of 
freight traffic. In addition, severe storms have caused major airport 
delays around the country. 

While  there  is  a  need  for  the  transportation  sector  to  adapt  to 
the environmental changes brought on by global climate change, it 
is also widely recognized that the transportation sector has contrib-
uted to the causes of climate change.

Transportation  sources  account  for  approximately  one-third  of 
U.S.  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  And  transportation  emissions  are 
among  the  fastest-rising  of  all  emitting  sectors,  due  to  increased 
consumption  of  gasoline,  jet  fuel,  and  diesel  fuel.  The  Environ-
mental Protection Agency estimates that greenhouse gas emissions 
attributable to the transportation sector will increase 26 percent by 
the year 2020. 

Today’s  hearing  will  examine  climate  change  research,  mitiga-
tion,  and  adaption  results,  efforts  in  the  transportation  sector,  in-
cluding  the  surface  transportation,  maritime,  and  aviation  indus-
tries.  The  Committee  looks  forward  to  hearing  from  the  witnesses 
about how the transportation sector can adapt to the impacts of cli-
mate  change,  increase  fuel  efficiency,  and  otherwise  reduce  green-
house gas emissions. 

We  have  several  witnesses  with  us  today.  Panel  one  consists  of 
the  Deputy  Secretary  of  the  Department  of  Transportation,  the 
Honorable  Thomas  Barrett;  Acting  Director  of  the  National  Insti-
tute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  Dr.  James  M.  Turner;  and  a 
Physical  Scientist  from  the  National  Climatic  Data  Center,  Na-
tional  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Admainistration,  Dr.  Thomas  C. 
Peterson. 

May I call upon Deputy Secretary Barrett. 
STATEMENT OF HON. THOMAS J. BARRETT, VICE ADMIRAL, 
DEPUTY SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 
Admiral  BARRETT.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you,  and  good  morning. 
I’m pleased to appear before you today and discuss the activities 
of  the  United  States  Department  of  Transportation  as  they  relate 
to  transportation’s  impact  on  climate  change  and  the  impacts  that 
climate change may have on the Nation’s transportation networks. 
This Committee brings a breadth of expertise and understanding 
to transportation’s vital role to the United States economy and our 
quality  of  life  and  its  impact  on  the  global  economy,  so  we  appre-
ciate your leadership on this important subject. 

To  support  the  Administration’s  climate  change  goals,  DOT  is 
working  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  transportation 
activities  and  prepare  for  the  impacts  of  climate  change  to  protect 
transportation  infrastructure.  As  we  pursue  these  goals,  like  you, 
we  are  mindful  of  the  indispensable  role  that  transportation  plays 
in  sustaining  and  improving  our  economy.  And,  like  you,  we  have 
seen  much  evidence  that  markets  provide  strong  incentives  for  in-
novation and improvement in efficiency. 

With that in mind, under Secretary Peters’s leadership, we have 
focused  our  approach  on  improving  vehicle  efficiency,  increasing 
use  of  alternative  fuels,  reducing  congestion,  advancing  the  effi-
ciency  of  the  transportation  system,  and  improving  our  under-
standing  of  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on  transportation  net-
works. 

The  Administration  is  leading  efforts  to  improve  the  fuel  econ-
omy  of  the  Nation’s  fleet  of  passenger  vehicles  and  light  trucks. 
Building  on  a  record  of  fuel  economy  reforms,  DOT  announced  a 
CAFE proposal, in April, that would save a projected 55 billion gal-
lons  of  fuel  and  reduce  U.S.  carbon  dioxide  emissions  by  521  mil-
lion  metric  tons  over  the  lifetime  of  the  regulated  vehicles,  going

above and beyond the requirements set out by Congress under the 
Energy Independence and Security Act. 

In  addition,  the  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration 
is  working  with  the  National  Academy  of  Science  to  develop  a 
study  of  fuel  economy  standards  for  medium-  and  heavy-duty 
trucks. 

The Administration strongly supports research on, and use of, al-
ternative  fuels.  The  Federal  Aviation  Administration,  for  example, 
is  a  major  partner  in  the  Commercial  Aviation  Alternative  Fuels 
Initiative,  and  DOT  has,  and  is,  undertaking  research  required  for 
development  of  safety  standards  for  future  hydrogen  vehicles  and 
infrastructure. 

And while we look at these, improvements in the efficiency of the 
existing  transportation  system  can  reduce  delays  and  also  deliver 
significant  environmental  benefits,  including  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions. 

The  Texas  Transportation  Institute  estimated  highway  conges-
tion in the United States wastes 2.9 billion gallons of fuel annually, 
translating  to  2.6  million  metric  tons  of  unnecessary  CO2.  And  all 
of  us  have  been  stuck  in  traffic,  watching  our  fuel  gauge  creep  to-
ward  empty  as  congestion  brings  traffic  to  a  crawl.  DOT  has  re-
sponded  with  a  congestion  initiative,  a  multifaceted  program  to 
ease  highway,  aviation,  freight,  intermodal,  and  border  congestion 
through direct user fees and more congestion pricing. 

I  would  invite  your  attention,  also,  Mr.  Chairman—aviation  is  a 
somewhat  unheralded  but  real  success  story  in  these  areas.  Com-
pared to the year 2000, U.S. commercial aviation in 2006 moved 12 
percent  more  passengers  and  22  percent  more  freight,  while  actu-
ally  burning  less  fuel  and  reducing  our  carbon  input  by  a  million 
tons. This is a result of airframe, power, and air traffic system im-
provements. U.S. airlines, in a very competitive market, have com-
mitted  to  another  30  percent  improvement  by  2025,  a  goal  the  in-
dustry  adopted  before  the  recent  spike  in  fuel  prices.  And  I  would 
urge  caution  in  not  hamstringing  this  flagship  U.S.  industry  that 
has such global reach by imposed new emission regimes. 

Clearly,  anyone  who  has  flown  lately,  though,  can  attest  to  the 
fact  that  the  current  aviation  system  needs  fundamental  changes. 
We recognize this and have begun to implement air traffic manage-
ment  procedures,  and  taken  steps  to  introduce  components  of  the 
next generation air transportation system. And the FAA is moving 
to  accelerate  implementation  of  that  system,  in  terms  you  may 
have heard, to make it more NowGen than NextGen, and they’ll be 
introducing  test  pad  sites  in  Florida  and  several  other  U.S.  city 
pairs this year. 

The  Department  is  also  addressing  the  challenges  posed  by  cli-
mate  on  transportation  infrastructure  and  systems.  DOT  released, 
earlier this year, the Gulf Coast study, which provides and assess-
ment of the vulnerabilities of transportation systems in the region, 
and subsequent phases will focus on developing tools for State and 
local officials to use as they develop their transportation plans and 
make investment decisions. 

We  have  also  begun  to  develop  a  congressionally  required  report 
on  transportation  impact  on  climate  change  and  ways  to  mitigate 
its impact on the changing environment.

In  sum,  the  Department  is  approaching  greenhouse  gas  mitiga-
tion in line with the Secretary’s priorities, and I know Congress is, 
for  a  safe,  efficient,  reliable,  and,  increasingly,  a  clean  transpor-
tation  network.  We  take  this  issue  very  seriously,  as  I  know  the 
Committee does. 

We  appreciate  the  attention  and  the  opportunity  to  discuss  the 

issue. And I would be pleased to respond to your questions, sir. 

[The prepared statement of Vice Admiral Barrett follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. THOMAS J. BARRETT, VICE ADMIRAL, 

DEPUTY SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 

Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens,  and  distinguished  Members,  I  am 
pleased to appear before the Committee today to discuss the various activities of the 
U.S. Department of Transportation as they relate both to transportation’s impact on 
climate  change  and  to  the  impacts  that  climate  change  may  have  on  the  Nation’s 
transportation  networks.  I  appreciate  your  attention  on  this  important  subject  and 
the expertise this Committee brings to transportation and the American and global 
economy. 

Addressing  the  challenge  that  global  climate  change  presents  will  require  a  sus-
tained  effort  over  many  years.  The  Bush  Administration  is  committed  to  cutting 
greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  to  mitigating  the  impacts  of  the  climate  change  that 
occur.  This  Administration  has  devoted  almost  $45  billion  to  support  climate 
change-related  programs,  with  an  additional  $40  billion  in  loan  guarantees  made 
available to support investments in technologies that promise to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions. 

The  Department  of  Transportation’s  principal  mission  is  to  ensure  the  safe,  effi-
cient, and reliable performance of our highway, transit, rail, maritime, pipeline, and 
aviation  networks.  We  also  support  the  Administration’s  efforts  to  reduce  the  Na-
tion’s greenhouse gas emissions, not only by working to reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions from transportation activities, but also by preparing for the impacts of climate 
change in order to protect our valuable transportation infrastructure. As we pursue 
each  of  these  goals,  we  are  always  mindful  of  the  indispensable  role  that  transpor-
tation  plays  in  sustaining  and  improving  our  economy,  and  supporting  our  trade, 
and  the  importance  of  transportation  infrastructure  to  the  millions  of  Americans 
who  depend  on  it  for  their  mobility  and  the  competitiveness  of  their  businesses. 
These  goals  are  all  a  part  of  the  Secretary’s  priorities  for  a  safe,  efficient,  reliable 
and clean transportation network. 
Reducing Transportation’s Impacts 

I would first like to discuss the Department’s approach to the mitigation of green-
house  gas  emissions  from  the  transportation  sector.  Our  approach  focuses  on:  im-
proving vehicle efficiency; increasing the use of alternative fuels; advancing the effi-
ciency of the transportation system (often by promoting market-based measures and 
technological  innovations);  and  improving  our  understanding  of  the  impacts  of  cli-
mate change on transportation infrastructure. 

Let  me  state  at  the  outset  that,  although  mandates  and  regulations  have  their 
place,  new  technologies  and  private  sector  innovations  are  really  the  keys  to  effec-
tively  addressing  climate  change  without  compromising  the  competitiveness  of  our 
transportation  providers  or  the  shippers  and  passengers  that  rely  upon  them.  As 
evidence, I refer you to the European aviation regulatory model that has encouraged 
a  decrease  in  overall  ridership  but  an  increase  in  emissions.  Compare  that  to  the 
more  open  market  approach  taken  in  the  U.S.—our  airlines  have  increased  rider-
ship  while  at  the  same  time  decreased  emissions  dramatically.  Between  2000  and 
2006,  aviation  CO2 emissions  in  the  U.S.  declined  by  about  4  percent.  During  the 
same period in Europe, emissions increased by around 30 percent. 
Vehicle and Engine Efficiency 

The  Administration  has  been  a  leader  in  improving  the  fuel  economy  of  the  Na-
tion’s  fleet  of  passenger  vehicles  and  light  trucks.  Our  record  in  this  area  speaks 
for  itself.  In  April,  Secretary  Peters  announced  a  proposal  that  would  establish  the 
first new fuel economy standards for passenger cars in more than two decades, and 
would  update  and  expand  fuel  economy  standards  for  light  trucks.  Once  finalized, 
this rule would raise 2011 passenger car fuel economy standards by 13 percent and 
boost light truck fuel economy standards by a further 4 percent above the attribute-

5 

weighted standard set 2 years ago. Overall, the fuel economy standards of the U.S. 
fleet would be raised by more than 25 percent through model year 2015. 

The  proposal  reflects  the  fuel  economy  reforms  passed  by  Congress  in  December 
2007  at  the  President’s  urging.  Indeed,  the  new  law,  the  Energy  Independence  and 
Security  Act  (EISA)  of  2007,  incorporates  many  of  the  provisions  of  the  President’s 
‘‘Twenty in Ten’’ initiative, aimed at reducing light duty vehicle petroleum consump-
tion  by  20  percent  in  10  years  through  both  improved  fuel  economy  standards  and 
increased use of alternative fuels. 

The  standards  in  the  proposed  rule  would  save  a  projected  55  billion  gallons  of 
fuel  and  reduce  U.S.  carbon  dioxide  emissions  by  521  million  metric  tons  over  the 
lifetime  of  the  regulated  vehicles.  It  also  includes  provisions  for  trading  fuel  econ-
omy  credits  between  manufacturers  and  vehicle  classes,  as  well  as  provisions  for 
carrying  forward  excess  credits  earned  in  earlier  years.  This  proposal  goes  above 
and beyond the requirements set out by Congress. 

This proposal builds on earlier initiatives to raise light truck fuel economy under 
prior  law.  The  Department  issued  new  fuel  economy  rules  for  light  trucks  in  2003 
(covering  model  years  2005–2007),  and  in  2006  (covering  model  years  2008–2011). 
The 2006 rulemaking implemented an innovative attribute-based standard for light 
trucks that Congress extended to passenger cars in EISA. The two earlier rules are 
estimated  to  save  13  billion  gallons  of  fuel  over  the  lifetimes  of  the  regulated  vehi-
cles. 

Through  the  Federal  Highway  Administration’s  Congestion  Mitigation  and  Air 
Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ), the Department is working with State and 
local  governments  on  a  range  of  programs  to  improve  urban  air  quality  within  the 
transportation  sector.  For  example,  DOT  has  cooperated  with  the  Environmental 
Protection Agency’s SmartWay Program initiative to retrofit trucks and truck stops 
with  on-board  and  off-board  auxiliary  power  to  run  vehicle  lights  and  air  condi-
tioning  and  reduce  truck  idling.  This  program  has  reduced  fuel  consumption,  cri-
teria  pollutant  emissions,  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  has  expanded  to  in-
clude  idling  emissions  from  marine,  agricultural,  rail,  and  off-road  heavy-duty  en-
gines.  The  Federal  Transit  Administration  funds  the  development  and  deployment 
of  alternative  fuel  buses,  including  hydrogen  fuel  cell  buses,  and  diesel-electric  hy-
brid buses, as well as alternative fuels infrastructure for transit systems across the 
United States. 

The  Department  also  has  focused  on  efficiency  beyond  the  highway.  In  aviation, 
we  have  begun  to  implement  the  Next  Generation  Air  Transportation  System  to 
modernize  the  U.S.  air  traffic  system,  of  which  I  will  say  more  in  a  moment.  The 
Federal  Aviation  Administration  is  in  the  process  of  setting  up  a  new  program, 
CLEEN—Continuous, Low Energy, Emissions, and Noise—a research consortium fo-
cused on cost-shared efforts accelerating the maturation of lower energy, emissions, 
and  noise  technologies  for  aircraft  and  engines  and  advancing  cleaner  alternative 
fuels.  The  Maritime  Administration  (MARAD)  is  focused  on  new  technologies  to  re-
duce  the  harmful  emissions  from  marine  diesel  engines  through  research  on  alter-
native fuels (such as biodiesel) and reduced ship stack emissions. 
Alternative Fuels 

The  Administration  also  is  supporting  research  on  and  use  of  alternative  fuels. 
The  EISA  requires  fuel  producers  to  supply  at  least  36  billion  gallons  of  renewable 
fuel  by  the  year  2022—a  500  percent  increase  in  the  use  of  renewable  fuels.  Presi-
dent  Bush  is  calling  on  every  vehicle  manufacturer  that  serves  the  U.S.  market  to 
produce flex-fuel vehicles across its fleet, providing tax incentives for drivers to buy 
fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles that run on both gasoline and electricity and investing 
in plug-in hybrids that can cover up to 40 miles on electricity alone. 

Though  corn-based  ethanol  is  currently  the  primary  way  to  meet  that  standard, 
that will not always be the case, and so the Administration also is investing in next 
generation  biofuels  such  as  cellulosic  ethanol.  Since  President  Bush  took  office,  the 
projected cost of cellulosic ethanol has dropped by more than 60 percent. 

Last year, the U.S. produced about 450 million gallons of biodiesel—up 80 percent 
from 2006. Today, there are more than 968 biodiesel fueling stations, and hundreds 
of fleet operators use biodiesel to fuel their trucks. Over the last 5 years, the Admin-
istration  has  invested  about  $1.2  billion  in  hydrogen  research  and  development  to 
help  bring  hydrogen  fuel  cell  vehicles  to  market.  These  vehicles  use  no  gasoline  at 
all, and emit only clean water. 

Even as the Administration focuses on alternative fuels and alt-fuels vehicles, we 
must ensure that the environmental improvements they bring do not erode the safe-
ty  levels  that  Americans  expect.  Through  the  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Ad-
ministration, the Research and Innovative Technology Administration, and the Pipe-
line  and  Hazardous  Materials  Safety  Administration,  we  have  undertaken  research

required  for  the  development  of  safety  standards  for  future  hydrogen  vehicles  and 
infrastructure. 

We  are  exploring  the  potential  of  alternative  fuels  for  aviation—fuels  that  could 
have benefits for energy security as well as emissions performance. The FAA is one 
of  the  key  partners  in  the  Commercial  Aviation  Alternative  Fuels  Initiative 
(CAAFI). CAAFI’s participants, which include airlines, manufacturers, airports, fuel 
producers, Federal agencies and international players, are implementing a roadmap 
for  the  use  of  alternative  fuels  for  commercial  aviation.  Commercial  airlines  and 
manufacturers are beginning to make some headway in experimental use of biofuels 
in jet aircraft. Using an unmodified Boeing 747, pilots for Richard Branson’s Virgin 
Atlantic  have  successfully  flown  from  London’s  Heathrow  airport  to  Amsterdam 
using a biofuel made of a mix of coconut and babassu oil. 
System Efficiency and the Marketplace 

As important as research may be, the Department is of course concerned first and 
foremost about making our networks as safe and reliable as possible. Secretary Pe-
ters has made improving the performance of those networks one of the Department’s 
primary  objectives,  because  severe  congestion  is  choking  our  major  urban  areas 
(and,  for  that  matter,  more  and  more  medium-sized  cities),  impeding  the  efficient 
flow of goods, and threatening our mobility—to the tune of about $200 billion every 
year  just  on  our  highways.  As  we  focus  on  increasing  efficiency,  we  simultaneously 
can  and  should  reduce  the  amount  of  needless  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  and  other 
emissions that those networks generate through idling, inefficient routing, and other 
undesirable effects. 

The  problem  is  significant.  The  Texas  Transportation  Institute  estimates  that 
highway  congestion  in  the  U.S.  wastes  approximately  2.9  billion  gallons  of  fuel  an-
nually,  translating  into  2.6  million  tons  of  unnecessary  CO2 emissions  every  year. 
We think this figure actually underestimates the costs associated with the near-con-
stant congestion that afflicts so many of our cities and our most important highway 
corridors.  I  think  all  of  us  have  experienced  this  first  hand  while  stuck  in  traffic 
watching the gas tank empty as congestion brings highway speeds to a crawl. 

The Department has responded with the Congestion Initiative, a multifaceted pro-
gram  aimed  at  easing  highway,  aviation,  freight/intermodal,  and  border  congestion. 
As  part  of  the  Initiative,  we  have  focused  on  encouraging  states  and  localities— 
which,  after  all,  own  nearly  all  our  highways—to  embrace  congestion  pricing  and 
direct user fees for both their operational and environmental benefits. 

Researchers  have  for  decades  predicted  the  beneficial  environmental  impacts  of 
pricing,  and  we  have  recently  seen  real  evidence  of  reduced  emissions  in  cities 
around the world following adoption of congestion pricing. One study found that con-
gestion  pricing  reduced  emissions  up  to  10  percent  in  the  aggregate  and  as  much 
as 30 percent in high pollution areas.1 These benefits are obtained because efficient 
pricing mechanisms reduce the number of trips taken, alter trip routes, reduce trip 
duration,  decrease  variation  in  travel  speeds,  and  facilitate  more  pollution-efficient 
travel  speeds.  A  study  of  Atlanta  during  the  1996  Summer  Olympics  revealed  sig-
nificant benefits.2 Several travel demand management measures were introduced to 
reduce  traffic  congestion  during  the  17  days  of  the  games.  The  study  found  that 
daily  peak  ozone  levels  dropped  28  percent  and  hospitalizations  for  asthma  fell  by 
almost 20 percent during that time. 

Moreover,  with  the  proliferation  of  open  road  pricing  technology,  highway  facili-
ties can achieve free-flow conditions without intrusive tollbooths, thus obtaining the 
efficiency  and  environmental  benefits  of  pricing  without  the  harmful  impacts  of 
queued vehicles waiting in line to pay. 

Real evidence of the emissions benefits of pricing is now available from Singapore, 
London,  Stockholm,  and  Germany.  Through  congestion  pricing,  London  reduced 
emissions  of  particulate  matter  and  nitrogen  oxides  by  12  percent  and  fossil  fuel 
consumption  and  CO2 emissions  by  20  percent.  Singapore  uses  pricing  to  manage 
demand  on  its  downtown  road  network  during  peak  travel  periods  and  has  pre-
vented the emission of an estimated 175,000 pounds of CO2. Stockholm’s congestion 
pricing  system,  which  targets  congestion  in  the  city  center,  has  led  to  a  10–14  per-
cent drop in CO2 emissions. In January 2005, Germany implemented a new system 
to  price  trucks  on  the  autobahns.  These  charges,  which  are  collected  electronically 
using  Global  Positioning  System  Satellites  (GPS),  are  based  not  only  on  distance

traveled  and  number  of  axles,  but  also  on  a  vehicle’s  emissions  class.  This  system 
has  increased  freight  efficiency  and  cut  freight  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  7  per-
cent. A 50 percent premium charge for older, more polluting trucks has doubled the 
replacement rate to new trucks. 

Our focus on variable pricing and other direct user fees also responds to the draw-
backs of a highway funding model that relies on gas tax revenues even as we strive 
toward  increased  energy  independence,  greater  fuel  economy  in  automobiles,  devel-
opment  of  alternative  fuels,  and  reduced  emissions.  The  EISA,  and  the  increasing 
popularity  of  hybrid  vehicles,  presage  reductions  in  the  amount  of  gas  tax  revenue 
available  for  investment  in  transportation.  Concerns  about  the  viability  of  gas  tax 
revenues are only exacerbated by the recent increases in fuel prices which have led 
to  reduced  vehicle  miles  travelled  on  U.S.  roads  (Americans  drove  1.4  billion  fewer 
miles  in  April  2008  than  they  did  in  April  2007,  the  sixth  consecutive  monthly 
drop).  As  the  United  States  works  to  reduce  emissions  and  promote  alternative 
fuels, a transportation funding system that relies primarily on the gas tax undoubt-
edly  contradicts  the  Nation’s  overall  policy  objectives.  Pricing  and  other  market  so-
lutions  can  help  address  concerns  about  the  viability  of  the  gas  tax  by  substituting 
private capital and direct user fees for gas tax revenue. 

Because  of  these  benefits,  tolling  and  direct  user  charges  have  won  support  from 
a  wide  range  of  ideological  viewpoints  in  the  United  States—from  Environmental 
Defense  and  the  Nature  Conservancy  to  the  Competitive  Enterprise  Institute  and 
the  Reason  Foundation.  Recognizing  the  environmental  benefits  of  this  approach, 
San  Francisco  Mayor  Gavin  Newsom  stated  in  his  recent  inaugural  address  that  a 
‘‘sensible  congestion-pricing  plan  is  the  single  greatest  step  we  can  take  to  protect 
[San Francisco’s] environment and improve our quality of life.’’ 

All of this is to say that we view congestion pricing as a win-win concept because 
it generates revenues that can be used to expand and maintain highways or bridges 
or transit, and it provides users with price signals that encourage rational decisions 
about  how  and  when  to  drive—yielding  efficiencies  that  are  at  once  an  environ-
mental and economic boon. 

Anyone  who  has  flown  lately  can  attest  to  the  fact  that  the  current  aviation  sys-
tem  needs  fundamental  changes.  I  briefly  made  reference  to  the  Next  Generation 
Air Transportation System, or NextGen. As with congestion pricing, this is an area 
in  which  efficiency  improvements  and  environmental  advances  go  hand-in-hand. 
NextGen  aims  to  improve  our  air  traffic  management  procedures  and  route  struc-
tures  so  that  aircraft  can  choose  more  efficient  routes,  make  quicker  in-flight  deci-
sions  to  avoid  weather  and  other  traffic,  and  even  operate  more  efficiently  on  the 
ground. 

The  FAA  and  our  commercial  airlines  have  saved  300  hundred  million  gallons  of 
jet  fuel  and  displaced  over  6  million  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions  by  imple-
menting Reduced Vertical Separation Minimums (RVSM), permitting aircraft flying 
in  U.S.  air  space  to  operate  at  more  efficient  altitudes.  FAA  has  achieved  further 
improvements  in  system  performance  through  the  related  reforms  of  Area  Naviga-
tion  (RNAV)  and  Required  Navigation  Performance  (RNP)—both  of  which  allow  for 
the more efficient routing for commercial air traffic and more reliable service during 
marginal  weather  conditions,  particularly  at  congested  airports  such  as  Atlanta 
Hartsfield. If we want to reduce jet fuel consumption and aircraft emissions without 
discouraging air travel, we must transform our aviation system. As we move to push 
Automatic  Dependent  Surveillance  Broadcast  (ADS–B)  into  the  cockpit,  we  antici-
pate  still  greater  efficiency  gains.  And,  because  every  gallon  of  jet  fuel  not  burned 
equates to roughly 20 pounds of displaced CO2, even small improvements yield huge 
GHG savings when deployed systemwide. 

These  advances,  combined  with  the  imperative  for  commercial  airlines  to  save 
fuel,  have  produced  reductions  in  GHG  emissions  that—contrary  to  frequent  criti-
cisms—are  quite  impressive.  Compared  to  the  year  2000,  U.S.  commercial  aviation 
in 2006 moved 12 percent more passengers and 22 percent more freight while actu-
ally  burning  less  fuel,  thereby  reducing  our  carbon  output  by  a  million  tons.  U.S. 
airlines  have  committed  to  another  30  percent  improvement  by  2025.  With  the  re-
cent  spike  in  fuel  prices,  reduction  in  schedules,  and  retirement  of  older  aircraft, 
fuel consumption by U.S. airlines will continue to decline. 

Internationally, the Department supports the International Civil Aviation Organi-
zation’s  continued  leadership  in  the  environmental  arena  and  its  decisive  action  in 
developing  a  comprehensive  plan  to  mitigate  aviation  GHG  emissions  and  estab-
lishing  a  new  high-level  Group  on  International  Aviation  and  Climate  Change  to 
work  with  ICAO’s  190  Member  States  to  implement  the  plan.  We  oppose,  I  should 
emphasize, the European Union’s proposal to include aviation in an ‘‘emissions trad-
ing scheme,’’ as both unworkable and contrary to international aviation law.

In 2008, we have seen auto buyers shift toward smaller vehicles and hybrids; air-
lines  modify  their  fleets  (and  their  operations)  to  do  more  flying  with  fuel-efficient 
aircraft and to get weight off the airplane; shippers move freight to an increasingly 
efficient  rail  network;  and  commuters  utilize  transit  services  in  greater  numbers. 
These  examples  contain  a  common  thread,  and,  of  course,  that  thread  is  that  the 
market  itself—especially  of  late—will  provide  ample  incentive  for  transportation 
providers and consumers to travel more efficiently and with reduced emissions. The 
Secretary  has  demonstrated  a  clear  commitment  to  improving  transit.  Cumulative 
VMT  has  fallen  by  17.3  billion  miles  since  November  2006,  and  we  estimate  that 
greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector fell by an estimated 9 million 
metric  tons  for  the  first  quarter  of  2008.  The  pain  from  increased  fuel  prices  that 
Americans are experiencing at the pump and in the grocery store is real and should 
not be minimized, but the changes we are seeing in transportation systems response 
to the high price of oil remind us that the marketplace can be a major ally in reduc-
ing  transportation’s  environmental  footprint  and  creating  the  conditions  necessary 
to spur private sector environmental innovation. 
Better Scientific Understanding 

I  also  would  like  to  summarize  the  Department’s  efforts  to  measure  and  prepare 
for the impacts that climate change may have on our transportation infrastructure. 
The  Department’s  Center  for  Climate  Change  and  Environmental  Forecasting  was 
designated by EISA to be the Office of Climate Change and Environment. This vir-
tual  organization  is  the  focal  point  within  DOT  for  multimodal  technical  expertise 
on  transportation  and  climate  change.  Nine  DOT  operating  administrations  con-
tribute resources to conduct strategic research, engage in policy analysis, and ensure 
coordination  on  multi-modal  approaches  to  reducing  transportation-related  green-
house  gases  and  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  global  climate  change  on  the  transpor-
tation  network.  Recent  and  continuing  research  has  focused  on  a  range  of  topics, 
including  emission  modeling,  evaluation  of  State  and  local  efforts,  early  action,  tax 
credits, alternative fuels, and urban ferries. 

Most recently, the Center has focused on research requirements from EISA: first, 
U.S. DOT has approved a statement of work to conduct an EISA-required report on 
transportation’s  impact  on  climate  change  and  ways  to  mitigate  transportation’s 
contribution. The study will also consider co-benefits of fuel savings and air quality 
improvement. This report will be conducted in coordination with the Environmental 
Protection  Agency  and  in  consultation  with  the  United  States  Global  Change  Re-
search  Program.  Second,  the  U.S.  DOT,  in  coordination  with  a  range  of  other 
groups,  is  developing  a  Transportation  and  Climate  Change  Clearinghouse  to  pro-
vide one-stop shopping for transportation decision-makers and planners. 

As  part  of  the  NextGen  effort  to  advance  our  understanding  of  aviation’s  effects 
on  climate,  the  FAA  has  launched  the  Aviation  Climate  change  Research  Initiative 
(ACCRI)  in  partnership  with  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration 
(NASA) and other agencies. This initiative will help accelerate our scientific under-
standing to inform policy decisions in this area. 

The Department also is addressing the challenges posed by the impacts of climate 
change  on  transportation  infrastructure  and  systems.  Our  Center  for  Climate 
Change and Environmental Forecasting has been studying this question for several 
years. Early this year, DOT released The Impacts of Climate Change and Variability 
on  Transportation  Systems  and  Infrastructure:  Gulf  Coast  Study,  Phase  I.  This 
study provides an assessment of the vulnerabilities of transportation systems in the 
region to potential changes in weather patterns and related impacts, as well as the 
effect of natural land subsidence in the region. The area examined by the study in-
cludes 48 contiguous counties in four states, running from Galveston, TX to Mobile, 
AL. 

Based  on  21  simulation  models  and  a  range  of  future  scenarios,  the  study  found 
that  potential  changes  in  climate,  through  both  sea  level  rise  and  subsidence  over 
the  next  50–100  years,  could  disrupt  transportation  services  in  several  key  ways. 
Twenty-seven percent of major roads, 9 percent of rail lines, and 72 percent of area 
ports  are  at  or  below  4  feet  in  elevation  above  sea  level,  and  could  be  vulnerable 
to future sea-level rise combined with non-climate related sinking of the area’s land 
mass  that  is  occurring  in  the  area.  The  study  is  designed  to  help  State  and  local 
officials  as  they  develop  their  transportation  plans  and  make  investment  decisions. 
Subsequent phases of the study are intended to focus on risks and adaptation strat-
egies  involved  in  planning,  investment,  and  design  decisions  for  infrastructure  in 
the Gulf Coast region and nationwide. The study was performed in partnership with 
the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  and  State  and  local  researchers,  and  is  one  of  21  ‘‘syn-
thesis and assessment’’ reports produced as part of the U.S. Climate Change Science 
Program.

A similar study that will soon be released is The Potential Impacts of Global Sea 
Level  Rise  on  Transportation  Infrastructure.  This  study  was  designed  to  produce 
rough  estimates  of  how  future  climate  change,  specifically  sea  level  rise  and  storm 
surge,  could  affect  transportation  infrastructure  on  the  East  Coast  of  the  United 
States. Like the Gulf Coast Study, this study’s major purpose is to aid policymakers 
by  providing  estimates  of  these  effects  as  they  relate  to  roads,  rails,  airports,  and 
ports. 

In sum, the Department is approaching greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation 
in  a  comprehensive,  multimodal,  and  innovative  way,  in  line  with  the  Secretary’s 
priorities for safety, system performance, and 21st century solutions. I commend the 
Committee for paying attention to this important subject and appreciate the oppor-
tunity  to  discuss  this  issue  with  a  group  of  individuals  who  are  so  knowledgeable 
about our transportation network. I look forward to your questions. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Dr. Turner? 

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  JAMES  M.  TURNER,  DEPUTY  DIRECTOR, 
NATIONAL  INSTITUTE  OF  STANDARDS  AND  TECHNOLOGY, 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 
Dr.  TURNER.  Yes,  sir.  Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you 
very much for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss 
the  research  related  to  the  transportation  sector  in  areas  that  are 
related to global climate change underway at the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology, or NIST. 

The  well-being  of  U.S.  citizens  is  affected  every  day  by  NIST’s 
measurements,  science,  and  standards  work.  Virtually  every  seg-
ment  of  the  economy,  from  transportation  to  computer  networks, 
banking,  food  processing,  healthcare,  communication,  depends  on 
NIST research, products, and services. More broadly, the quality of 
the water we drink, the air we breathe, the energy we use, and the 
food we eat depends, in part, on that work. 

Just  as  NIST  has  impacted  these  technologies  in  the  past,  NIST 
is  poised  to  play  an  equally  important  role  in  our  Nation’s  efforts 
to  address  the  challenges  of  climate  change.  A  large  part  of  the 
work  that  NIST  does  for  the  transportation  sector  has  an  impact 
on climate change. 

In  the  area  of  transportation,  let  me  start  with  an  example. 
NIST  conducts  research  and  provides  measurement  science  and 
services  that  underpin  many  stages  of  the  transportation  sector  in 
auto  manufacturing,  from  the  production  of  materials,  like  sheet 
metal for body panels, to monitoring the final quality of the vehicle 
assembly.  NIST’s  work  extends  beyond  the  car  to  the  transpor-
tation  infrastructure  itself,  including  both  fossil  and  alternative 
fuels  and  emissions,  to  lightweight  metals  and  composites  for  auto 
body parts and fuel cells. 

Another  big  area  NIST  works  in  is  advanced  materials,  like  ce-
ment,  for  bridges  and  highways.  Cement  production  provides  a 
large  amount  of  CO2,  and  NIST’s  work  to  improve  the  quality  of 
cement will lead to less frequent replacement. 

Specific  areas  that  I  address  in  more  detail  in  my  written  testi-
mony  include  composition,  volume,  and  weight  standards  for  fuels 
and  oil  to  allow  confidence  in  the  trading  of  low  and  high  sulfur 
content  fuels  in  competitive  markets.  This  covers  everything  from 
measures and standards for fossil fuels, to biofuels, from train cars 
of  coal,  to  gallons  of  gasoline  at  the  pump;  to  gas  reference  stand-
ards  for  sulfur  dioxide  and  nitrous  oxides  that  enable  the  auto-

motive  manufacturers  to  meet  the  EPA  standards;  allow  industry 
to tune and trade their emissions through the EPA’s sulfur dioxide 
cap-and-trade  system;  to  composition  of  refrigerants  in  automotive 
air-conditioning  systems  to  eliminate  chlorofluorocarbons  and  find 
replacements  that  minimize  the  impacts  on  the  ozone-depletion  in 
the  upper  atmosphere;  to  production  of  roadway  materials  and  the 
composition,  strength,  and  durability  of  road  and  bridge  materials 
and construction techniques to minimize greenhouse gas emissions; 
to lightweight metal-forming and composites to enable manufactur-
ers  to  have  high-performance,  high-durability,  and  safe  materials 
to  increase  efficiency  in  the  automotive  and  aerospace  industry;  to 
development  of  measurements,  science,  and  standards  infrastruc-
ture  to  support  the  development  and  implementation  of  advanced 
alternative fuel sources, such as hydrogen and biofuels; and finally, 
to the development of the Smart Grid standards for plug-in hybrid 
electric vehicles scheduled to be in showrooms in 2010. 

Automobiles and light trucks consume 79 percent of all U.S. dis-
tilled  fuel  and  account  for  19.8  percent  of  all  U.S.  CO2 emissions. 
Lightweight  materials  are  a  big  part  of  the  solution  to  reduce  our 
consumption, as lighter vehicles tend to use less fuel. 

The  Department  of  Energy’s  Office  of  Vehicle  Technology  states 
that  lightweight  materials  are  needed  to  ‘‘offset  the  increased 
weight  and  cost  per  unit  of  power  of  alternative  power  trains,  hy-
brids, and fuel cells, with respect to conventional power trains.’’ 

The  transportation  industry,  particularly  the  automotive  and 
aerospace  industry,  is  looking  for  lightweight  materials,  such  as 
new  lightweight  aluminum  and  composite  materials,  to  improve 
fuel  efficiency.  Introduction  of  these  materials  is  limited  by  severe 
manufacturing difficulties tied to unpredictable small-scale stresses 
during  production.  DOE  and  NIST  scientists  developed  a  way  to 
measure  and  map  stresses  on  this  scale  using  X-ray  micro-beams 
that  are  100  times  thinner  than  a  human  hair.  These  measure-
ments  have  solved  key  scientific  questions  about  how  metals  de-
form,  and  this  knowledge  will  accelerate  the  introduction  of  light-
weight alloys into fuel-efficient vehicles. 

Before  I  sum  up  my  remarks,  I’d  like  to  briefly  mention  two  of 
our  requested  budget  initiatives  for  2009  that  will  greatly  expand 
our capabilities and ability to have an impact on the broader issue 
of climate change. 

The expansion of the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) 
is  integral  to  our  programs  that  impact  transportation-related  cli-
mate  change  issues  because  of  the  ability  to  image  the  interior  of 
operating  hydrogen  fuel  cells.  Large  and  small  companies  involved 
in  the  manufacture  or  use  of  fuel  cells,  including  General  Motors, 
DuPont,  and  PlugPower,  have  benefited  from  this  unique  capa-
bility. 

Industry  scientists  have  stated  that  the  research  performed  at 
the  NIST  Center  for  Neutron  Research  has  allowed  them  to  jump 
5 years ahead in fuel cell development. 

The second initiative, which is related directly to the work made 
possible  by  the  NCNR,  is  an  expansion  of  our  program  targeted  to 
enable  the  use  of  hydrogen  as  a  fuel.  This  initiative  would  expand 
our  work  to  address  more  of  the  technical  challenges  that  need  to 
be  overcome  before  hydrogen  can  become  a  practical  and  economic

alternative fuel, such as its propensity to embrittle materials which 
could  lead  to  problems  in  containment  and  distribution  infrastruc-
ture integrity, not to mention the challenges associated with meas-
uring  and  distributing  it  to  ensure  equitable  sale  in  the  market-
place. 

Today, more than any other time in our history, technological in-
novation and progress depend upon NIST’s unique skills and capa-
bility.  Helping  the  U.S.  to  drive  and  take  advantage  of  the  in-
creased pace of technological change is a top priority for NIST. The 
technologies  that  emerge  as  a  result  of  NIST’s  development  of 
measurement  science  and  standard  tools  will  enable  U.S.  compa-
nies  to  innovate  and  remain  competitive.  That  absolutely  includes 
the  need  to  develop  both  information  and  measures  to  enable  the 
United States and other nations to deal with the potential and real 
climate-related impacts of transportation systems and components. 
This  concludes  my  remarks,  and  I’ll  be  happy  to  answer  any 

questions you may have, sir. 

[The prepared statement of Dr. Turner follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. JAMES M. TURNER, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, NATIONAL 
INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 

Chairman Inouye, Vice Chairman Stevens, and Members of the Committee, thank 
you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today  to  discuss  the  research  we  do 
related  to  the  transportation  sector  on  areas  that  are  related  to  global  climate 
change underway at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). 

The  well-being  of  U.S.  citizens  is  affected  every  day  by  NIST’s  measurement  and 
standards  work.  Virtually  every  segment  of  the  economy,  from  transportation  to 
computer  networks,  banking,  food  processing,  health  care  and  communication,  de-
pends  on  NIST  research,  products  and  services.  More  broadly,  the  quality  of  the 
water  we  drink,  the  air  we  breathe,  the  energy  that  we  use,  and  the  food  we  eat 
depends in part on that work. 

The  work  NIST  is  doing  on  climate  change  is  important.  Some  of  the  drivers  of 
climate,  such  as  the  sun’s  output,  have  small  variations  that  change  slowly  over 
time. As a result, climate predictions depend on developing absolute measurements 
of the sun’s energy that can be compared accurately over decades from different sen-
sors. Other important variables include the sizes, shapes, and chemical composition 
of particles or droplets (aerosols) in the atmosphere. Whether aerosols contribute to 
the warming or the cooling of the Earth depends upon their composition. 

In  the  area  of  transportation,  let  me  start  with  one  example.  NIST  conducts  re-
search  and  provides  measurement  science  and  services  that  underpin  many  stages 
of  auto  manufacturing—from  the  production  of  materials  like  sheet  metal  for  body 
panels to monitoring the final quality of the vehicle assembly. NIST’s work extends 
beyond  the  car  to  the  transportation  infrastructure  itself,  including  both  fossil  and 
alternative  fuels;  emissions;  advanced  materials  like  cement  for  bridges  and  high-
ways to lightweight metals and composites for auto body parts; fuel cells; and more 
efficient and greener manufacturing processes: 

In addition, NIST works in the following areas: 
• Composition, volume, and weight standards for fuels and oil to allow confidence 
in  trading  in  low  to  high  sulfur  content  fuels  in  competitive  markets.  This  cov-
ers  everything  from  measures  and  standards  for  fossil  fuels  to  biofuels,  and 
from train cars of coal to gallons of gasoline at the pump. 
• Gas reference standards for sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxides that enable auto-
motive  manufacturers  to  meet  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  stand-
ards and generally allow industry to tune and trade their emissions through the 
EPA sulfur dioxide cap and trade system. 
• Composition of refrigerants in automotive air conditioning systems to eliminate 
chlorofluorocarbons  and  find  replacements  that  minimize  impacts  on  ozone  de-
pletion  in  the  upper  atmosphere,  as  well  as  climate  forcing  due  to  these  gases. 
• Production  of  roadway  materials,  and  the  composition,  strength,  and  durability 
of  road  and  bridge  materials  and  construction  techniques  to  minimize  green-
house gas (GHG) emissions.

• Lightweight  metal  forming  and  composites  to  enable  manufacturers  to  have 
high  performance,  high  durability  and  safe  materials  to  increase  efficiency  in 
the automotive and aerospace industry. 

• Developing  Smart  Grid  standards  for  plug-in  hybrid  electrical  vehicles  sched-

uled to be in showrooms in 2010. 

• More  efficient,  greener  manufacturing  through  a  partnership  with  EPA  on  the 

Green Supplier Network. 

Now I would like to cover some specific work NIST is undertaking to improve effi-
ciencies in the transportation industry that could reduce the impact of the industry 
on  climate  change.  I  also  want  to  note  that  NIST  has  requested  budget  increases 
in  FY09  that  would  enable  us  to  expand  and  accelerate  our  work  in  this  area.  It 
also is important to note that nearly all of NIST’s work is planned and done in part-
nership with others in industry, universities, and government at all levels. 
Supporting  Innovations  in  Fossil,  Bio  Fuels  and  Hydrogen  Fuel  Cells— 
Monitoring  Emissions  and  Developing  New  Fuel  Capabilities  and 
Standards 

Fossil  Fuels  Standard  Reference  Materials  (SRMs)—Standards  in  Emissions.  Be-
ginning  in  June  2006  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  mandated  ultra- 
low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel to make possible more efficient exhaust emissions. The 
accurate  determination  of  sulfur  in  ULSD  at  low  levels  is  a  major  measurement 
challenge with enormous economic consequences, mostly in avoided costs, for petro-
leum refineries and for every link in the distribution system. To meet this challenge, 
industry must have highly accurate sulfur standards. These SRMs ensure the accu-
rate make up of the fuel and enable compliance to EPAs regulations regarding sul-
fur  fuels.  NIST  is  the  place  to  go  for  an  SRM  for  a  fossil  fuel.  NIST’s  first  fossil 
fuel SRMs were issued in 1967 and continue to be issued today. 

These standards represent some of NIST’s most successful products. According to 
the  study  Economic  Impact  of  Standard  Reference  Materials  for  Sulfur  in  Fossil 
Fuels, NIST work returned a calculated rate of return for the program of 1,056 per-
cent.  Studies  also  demonstrate  that  NIST  standards  for  sulfur  in  fossil  fuels  have 
a net value to society of more than $409 million since 1984. 

Biofuels.  Biofuels  have  gained  popularity  worldwide  both  as  a  renewable  energy 
source  and  as  a  way  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  move  away  from  de-
pendence  on  fossil  fuels.  NIST  is  participating  in  this  arena.  The  United  States, 
Brazil and the European Union have convened a task force of experts to study exist-
ing  biofuels  standards  and  catalog  similarities  and  differences  between  them.  Out 
of  this  partnership,  NIST  and  Brazil  are  collaborating  on  the  development  of  joint 
measurement standards for bioethanol and biodiesel by the end of 2008. 

Getting  an  Accurate  Fill-Up.  Working  very  closely  with  State  weights  and  meas-
ures  organizations,  NIST  has  long  maintained  the  standard  for  ensuring  that  con-
sumers  actually  receive  a  gallon  of  gas  every  time  they  pay  for  one.  Now  NIST  re-
searchers  are  incorporating  the  properties  of  hydrogen  in  standards  that  will  sup-
port the development of hydrogen as a fuel in vehicles. One of the challenges in the 
use  of  hydrogen  as  a  vehicle  fuel  is  the  seemingly  trivial  matter  of  measuring  fuel 
consumption.  Consumers  and  industry  are  accustomed  to  high  accuracy  when  pur-
chasing gasoline. Refueling with hydrogen is a problem because there are currently 
no  mechanisms  to  ensure  accuracy  at  the  pump.  Hydrogen  is  dispensed  at  a  very 
high pressure, at varying degrees of temperature and with mixtures of other gases. 
NIST’s research and new technological innovations will enable accuracy in hydrogen 
fill-ups. 

Fuel  Research  for  Aviation,  Aerospace  and  Vehicular  Transportation.  NIST  has  a 
major  effort  underway  to  characterize  and  model  fuel  fluids.  All  reformulations  of 
these fuels changes the way they operate and NIST is working to identify how they 
are  affected.  These  liquid  fuels  have  long  been  the  most  convenient  fuel  source  for 
all sectors of transportation—aircraft, rockets, cars, trucks, locomotives and military 
vehicles.  The  design  and  specification  of  these  fuels  has  environmental  consider-
ations. Redesigning fuels with environmental considerations as a factor can only be 
done  after  NIST  does  its  job  of  understanding  how  different  additives  and  formula-
tions affect the fuel. 

Enabling  the  Use  of  Hydrogen  Fuel.  As  mentioned  above,  NIST  is  working  to  en-
able  the  use  of  hydrogen  as  a  fuel.  Hydrogen  offers  the  possibility  of  lowering  the 
impact of motor vehicles on the environment, and reducing our Nation’s dependence 
on  foreign  oil.  While  the  burning  of  fossil  fuels  produces  carbon  dioxide  and  other 
emissions  harmful  to  the  environment,  hydrogen  fuel  can  be  made  from  many  en-
ergy sources, including renewables, and produces zero emissions.

Technical  challenges  need  to  be  overcome  to  make  hydrogen-powered  vehicles 
more practical and economical. Fuel cells need to operate as reliably as today’s gaso-
line engine. We need systems that can store enough hydrogen fuel to give consumers 
a  comfortable  driving  range.  We  need  science-based  standards  that  will  guide  local 
officials in establishing codes for building and fire safety as they relate to something 
like  a  hydrogen  fueling  station.  And  we  need  a  technical  infrastructure  to  ensure 
the equitable sale of hydrogen in the marketplace, as exists today for gasoline. 

Expansion of research efforts at NIST is essential to achieving widespread use of 
hydrogen  as  a  fuel.  The  distribution  and  sale  of  hydrogen  will  require  entirely  new 
systems  for  ensuring  equity  in  the  marketplace.  In  Fiscal  Year  2009,  NIST  has  re-
quested  $4  million  to  accelerate  its  research  in  this  area.  NIST  has  been  a  leading 
provider of data on the chemical and physical properties of hydrogen for more than 
50 years. It has statutory responsibility under the Pipeline Safety Act of 2002 (P.L. 
107–355)  to  develop  research  and  standards  for  gas  pipeline  integrity,  safety,  and 
reliability. It is the lead U.S. agency for weights and measures of vehicle fuels, and 
it  develops  test  protocols  for  stationary  fuel-cell  systems,  covering  issues  of  effi-
ciency,  performance,  and  compatibility  with  the  power  grid  for  interconnection  pur-
poses. 

NIST’s Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) is the premier facility for real-time, 
three-dimensional  imaging  of  hydrogen  in  operating  fuel  cells.  NIST’s  operations 
have won awards and wide praise for providing the diagnostics that industry needs 
to  make  fuel  cells  more  reliable  and  less  costly.  The  unique  resources  developed  at 
this NIST facility will also help reduce technical barriers for efficient hydrogen pro-
duction and storage. Indeed, NIST participates in two of the three Centers of Excel-
lence established by DOE to develop better means of hydrogen storage. 

Transporting  and  Distributing  Hydrogen.  Gasoline  consumption  in  the  U.S.  ex-
ceeds  388  million  gallons  per  day  and  at  $4  a  gallon  that  is  a  growing  investment. 
Producing hydrogen fuel from domestic energy sources will increase domestic control 
and  substantially  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  One  barrier  to  this  switch  is 
pipelines. There are currently 700 miles of hydrogen pipelines in operation—that is 
in comparison to 1 million miles of natural gas pipelines. To move to a more nation-
wide  use  of  hydrogen,  safe  and  effective  pipelines  have  to  be  developed.  This  work 
will also be part of the NIST Fiscal Year 2009 Hydrogen initiative request of $4 mil-
lion  dollars  to  accelerate  research  in  this  area.  NIST  is  working  on  both  sensor  de-
velopment  to  monitor  the  pipelines  and  steel  and  material  testing  to  ensure  the 
safest  pipeline  possible.  NIST  is  working  to  establish  the  codes  and  standards  nec-
essary to ensure safe distribution of hydrogen fuels. The future ‘‘hydrogen economy’’ 
will depend on efficient transport of fuel across the U.S. In order to use the existing 
network  of  pipelines,  tests  have  to  be  developed  to  test  for  the  degradation  that  is 
likely to occur to the metals that can be caused by hydrogen weakening the pipeline. 
By establishing the unique test facilities and standard test procedures, we will pro-
vide  pipeline  operators  with  critical  data  on  the  durability  of  pipeline  material  in 
high-pressure hydrogen gas environments. 

Hydrogen  Storage.  Hydrogen  is  promoted  as  a  petroleum  replacement  that  pre-
sents an attractive alternative for fueling automobiles and trucks while maintaining 
a  cleaner  global  environment.  A  major  roadblock  associated  with  the  use  of  hydro-
gen  is  the  inability  to  store  it  efficiently.  Because  hydrogen’s  properties  have  been 
shown to embrittle metals and because current storage technologies limit the poten-
tial  range  of  hydrogen  powered  vehicles,  NIST  is  working  on  measurement  tools  to 
determine  hydrogen’s  absorption/desorption  characteristics  that  will  accelerate  dis-
covery  of  new  materials  that  can  be  used  to  store  hydrogen  for  use  across  the  U.S. 
Fuel  Cell  Research.  This  is  another  area  where  innovations  can  have  an  impact 
on the environment. A huge array of emerging technologies, from new portable elec-
tronic  devices  to  smart  energy  vehicles,  depend  on  the  successful  development  and 
deployment of efficient, lightweight, reliable and cost-effective fuel cells. The poten-
tial  market  for  these  new  products  represents  billions  of  dollars  to  the  U.S.  econ-
omy.  NIST’s  Center  for  Neutron  Research  (NCNR)  works  with  General  Motors  and 
others in this area. NIST’s expertise is essential for making fuel cells less costly and 
more reliable. 

To  develop  fuel  cells  for  practical  use,  NIST  researchers  are  developing  measure-
ment  methods  to  characterize  the  nanoscale  structure  and  dynamics  of  polymer 
membranes  inside  the  fuel  cell  to  enable  stronger  fuel  cells.  Industry’s  use  of  the 
unique facilities and instruments at NIST will help reduce technical barriers for ef-
ficient hydrogen production, storage, and use.

Supporting  Innovation  in  Advanced  Materials—Lightweight  Materials  and 

Nanocomposites 

14 

In addition to the work NIST is doing in the area of hydrogen fuel, other research-
ers  at  NIST  are  looking  at  materials  that  will  make  more  efficient  cars,  airplanes 
and  trains.  These  efficiencies  also  will  strongly  benefit  the  environment  by  intro-
ducing lighter, more fuel efficient transportation. 

Automobiles  and  light  trucks  consume  79  percent  of  all  U.S.  distilled  fuel  and 
emit  19.8  percent  of  all  U.S.  CO2 emissions.  Lightweight  materials  are  a  big  part 
of the solution to reduce our consumption. The Department of Energy, Office of Ve-
hicle  Technologies  states  that  lightweight  materials  are  needed  to  ‘‘offset  the  in-
creased  weight  and  cost  per  unit  of  power  of  alternative  powertrains  (hybrids,  fuel 
cells) with respect to conventional powertrains.’’ 

Lightweight  Materials  for  Automobiles.  The  transportation  industry  in  general, 
particularly  the  automotive  industry,  is  looking  for  lightweight  materials  such  as 
new lightweight aluminum and high-strength steel alloys to improve fuel efficiency. 
Introduction  of  these  alloys  is  limited  by  severe  manufacturing  difficulties  tied  to 
unpredictable micron-scale stresses during production. NIST and industry scientists 
developed  a  way  to  measure  and  map  stresses  on  the  micron  scale  using  X-ray 
microbeams  that  are  100  times  thinner  than  a  human  hair.  These  measurements 
have  solved  key  scientific  questions  about  how  metals  deform  and  this  knowledge 
will accelerate the introduction of new lightweight alloys into fuel-efficient vehicles. 
NIST is partnering with the automotive industry to accelerate the introduction of 
aluminum  and  high-strength  steel  into  automobile  production  and  is  collaborating 
with  the  Argonne  National  Laboratory’s  Advanced  Photon  Source  and  the  Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory to measure stresses in deformed metals at the nanoscale 
level. 

NIST  Center  for  Metal  Forming.  The  NIST  Center  for  Metal  Forming  is  devel-
oping the measurements, standards and analysis necessary for the U.S. automotive 
industry and metal suppliers to transition to new ways of forming metals. This will 
enable  the  industry  to  transition  to  new  advanced  and  lightweight  materials  more 
easily as more accurate data and material models will lead to more accurate die de-
signs,  reducing  redesign  and  new  model  development  costs.  The  reduction  of  sheet 
metal forming redesigns through improved material data and models is projected to 
save the U.S. auto industry a large portion of the $600 million lost per year on rede-
signs. 

Determining  the  Life  Cycle  and  Environmental,  Health  and  Safety  Performances 
of  Polymer  Nanocomposites.  Polymer  nanocomposites,  defined  as  material  systems 
in  which  one  or  more  dimensions  is  less  than  100  nm,  have  greatly  improved  per-
formance  properties  relative  to  traditional  polymeric  materials  and  are  forecast  to 
make significant in roads in the near future in high volume markets including infra-
structure, automotive, and aerospace industries. However, use of these materials in 
products is hindered by the lack of performance data for them, as well as significant 
societal  concerns  regarding  the  release  of  significant  quantities  of  nanomaterials 
into the environment during or at the end of the product service life. Critical infor-
mation  and  data  is  lacking  for  characterizing  and  predicting  life  cycle  performance 
and in-service release rates of nanoparticles from polymer nanocomposites. Although 
current  research  focuses  on  nanoparticle  exposure  during  the  manufacturing  proc-
ess, in-service release of nanoparticles from nanocomposites is expected to be great-
er  by  several  orders  of  magnitude.  NIST  will  develop  and  apply  measurement 
science  over  a  wide  range  of  length  and  time  scales  to  enable  a  comprehensive  un-
derstanding  of  life  cycle  performance  and  nanoparticle  release  rates  of  polymer 
nanocomposites. 

Timely, accurate, and precise material life cycle performance estimates will enable 
a revolutionary transformation from initial cost to life cycle cost-based materials se-
lections. Information regarding nanoparticle release rates over the life cycle of nano-
composite  materials  will  ensure  safety  in  commerce  by  directly  addressing  public, 
environmental,  and  regulatory  concerns  regarding  the  environmental,  health,  and 
safety  aspects  of  these  materials.  This  research  will  also  foster  innovation  through-
out  the  nanocomposites  supply  chain  such  as  material  and  product  manufacturers, 
and  end  users  and  improve  the  competitive  position  of  U.S.  industry  in  the  global 
market. 

While NIST’s work in the automotive and related industries is important to reduc-
ing our impact on the environment, there are many ways in which NIST’s research 
in the area of transportation infrastructure could reduce our impact on our climate.

Supporting  Innovation  in  Transportation  Infrastructure  Via  Concrete 

Research That Will Have an Impact on the Environment 

15 

Most  of  the  U.S.  and  the  world’s  infrastructure—transportation  structures,  tun-
nels, airports, buildings, dams, industrial plants—is made out of concrete. There has 
been  significant  work  in  the  area  of  concrete  technology  over  the  last  few  decades 
to greatly improve processing and properties making concrete more sustainable. 

Why  is  this  important  to  climate  change?  The  cement  and  concrete  industry  is  a 
large  generator  of  greenhouse  gas,  mainly  carbon  dioxide  (CO2),  during  the  manu-
facturing production process. One U.S. ton of cement produces about one ton of CO2 
and the annual world production of cement—2.5 billion tons—is equal to a 3–9 per-
cent estimated share of world man-made CO2. In 2006, the U.S. produced 96 million 
tons of cement and 37 million tons were imported for use in the U.S. It is estimated 
that 1.5 percent of U.S. man-made CO2 generation comes from concrete production. 
And  while  this  is  a  large  number,  cement  production  is  forecast  to  greatly  increase 
over  the  next  20–40  years  because  of  burgeoning  demand  for  new  and  replacement 
infrastructure. 

In  the  U.S.,  the  energy  efficiency  of  cement  production  is  already  high,  and  is 
probably  only  capable  of  fairly  small  improvements.  One  is  limited  to  reducing  the 
CO2 that is given off from the raw materials by partially substituting another mate-
rial for the cement in concrete, such as the substitution of non-CO2 containing mate-
rials for a portion of the limestone in the raw materials. Around the world, the two 
most  common  minerals  used  to  substitute  for  cement  are  fly  ash  and  granulated 
ground  blast  furnace  slag.  The  use  of  fly  ash  and  slag  in  concrete  can  actually  im-
prove the properties of concrete, especially the durability. 

NIST is planning to incorporate research on fly ash into our research program in 
this year and is currently collaborating with several research institutions in submit-
ting  joint  proposals  in  response  to  a  Federal  Highway  Administration  Broad  Area 
Announcement pertaining to fly ash. In addition, our researchers have published ex-
tensively on the incorporation of fly ash into concrete for other Federal agencies. 

Let me highlight some of NIST’s work to address the needs of the concrete indus-
try  itself.  All  of  our  work  will  improve  our  understanding  of  how  cement  and  con-
crete  actually  work,  and  ultimately  should  make  possible  improvements  in  the  for-
mulation  and  use  of  cement  that  could  save  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  in  an-
nual  maintenance  and  repair  costs  for  concrete  structures  and  the  country’s  infra-
structure.  This  work  should  also  lead  to  improving  the  properties  and  performance 
of  concrete  while  decreasing  energy  costs  and  reducing  the  CO2 emissions  from  its 
production. 

Using NIST State of the Art Tools to Study Concrete. Using the most modern tools 
of materials research, researchers from NIST and industry are exploring one of the 
oldest but most complex construction materials—cement. 

Cement may be the world’s most widely used manufactured material—more than 
two billion metric tons are consumed each year—but it also is one of the more com-
plex. And while it was known to the Romans, who used it to good effect in the Coli-
seum  and  Pantheon,  questions  still  remain  as  to  just  how  it  works,  in  particular 
how  it  is  structured  at  the  nano-  and  microscale,  and  how  this  structure  affects  its 
performance. NIST’s investigations should lead to a better understanding of the con-
tribution of the nanoscale structure of cement to concrete durability, and how to im-
prove it. 

Processing  of  High-Performance  Concrete:  Mixing  and  Flow  Properties.  NIST  re-
searchers  are  looking  at  ways  to  develop  cement  paste  and  mortar  measurement 
techniques. Researchers are also looking at models of mortar and concrete flow, and 
guidelines for optimizing the proportioning and processing of high-performance con-
crete  (HPC).  At  present,  there  are  no  generally  accepted  guidelines  for  formulating 
and  mixing  HPC  and  no  standard  tests  for  measuring  the  workability  of  HPC  in 
terms  of  fundamental  flow  quantities  such  as  yield  stress  and  plastic  viscosity.  In 
the  selection  of  mixture  proportions,  many  methods  exist  for  present-day  concretes, 
but none has received general acceptance and only a few are based on performance 
rather  than  prescription;  all  require  the  making  and  testing  of  numerous  batches, 
which is not the most efficient way to test. We need to link the mixture composition 
with performance, including flow properties. A method for predicting the flow prop-
erties of HPC from mixture proportions will result in a significant reduction of cost 
in designing HPC mixtures with optimum performance, both in the fresh and hard-
ened states. NIST is developing models to simulate various scenarios to address this 
issue and to improve the performance of concrete. 

Virtual  Cement  and  Concrete  Testing  Laboratory  (VCCTL)  Cement  Hydration 
Modeling.  A  new  hydration  model  is  part  of  a  NIST/industry  consortium  to  design, 
develop,  document,  and  validate  a  novel,  next-generation  computer  model  of  micro-
structure development of hydrating cement paste. The hydration of portland cement

pastes  is  an  extremely  complicated  phenomena  involving  many  chemical  reactions. 
The  VCCTL  consortium  is  committed  to  the  development  of  a  computer  model, 
based on accepted reaction thermodynamics and kinetics that can make reliable pre-
dictions  of  the  kinetics  of  3–D  microstructure  development  and  its  dependence  on 
various  chemical  admixtures.  Such  a  model  could  become  a  valuable  research  tool 
for  cement  and  admixture  companies  and  could  help  them  reduce  the  amount  of 
physical testing that they currently perform. 

Micro- and Macrostructural Characterization of High-Performance Concrete. NIST 
is  developing  methods  for  characterizing  of  the  micro-  and  macrostructures  of  ce-
ments and high-performance concrete. To understand how concrete will react under 
certain circumstances—in numerous environments—one has to understand concrete 
at  the  micro  level.  The  methodology  developed  by  NIST  will  form  the  basis  for  as-
sessing  and  predicting  concrete  composition  and  texture  influences  on  performance. 
This  project  will  lead  to  an  improved  understanding  of  concrete  degradation  and 
therefore reduce the need for repeated replacement of concrete and thereby reducing 
the CO2 emissions associated with the production of cement. 

Simulation  of  the  Performance  and  Service  Life  of  High  Performance  Concrete. 
NIST  is  also  looking  at  computer  simulation  algorithms  for  the  service  life  of  high- 
performance  concrete.  The  service  life  of  HPC  depends  on  almost  all  performance 
properties,  such  as  transport  properties  like  resistance  to  chemical  penetration  and 
mechanical  properties  like  elasticity.  These  properties  need  to  be  predicted  at  the 
design  stage,  so  that  HPC  can  be  designed  for  durability  and  lifecycle  cost  require-
ments,  not  just  strength  requirements.  The  only  accurate  way  that  different  kinds 
of HPC can be handled is to base such predictions on fundamental materials science 
that  includes  microstructure,  cement  chemistry,  concrete  mixture  design,  and  ex-
pected curing. Since concrete is made up of particles at many length scales (e.g., ce-
ment,  fly  ash,  silica  fume,  sand,  gravel),  quantitative  characterization  of  particle 
shape  is  needed  so  that  real  particles  can  be  used  in  these  kinds  of  quantitative 
models. 

Adaptive Concrete Technologies. NIST researchers are investigating adaptive con-
crete  technologies  including  internal  curing  and  the  incorporation  of  phase  change 
materials into concrete to increase its service life. Field concrete is exposed to a wide 
variety of environmental conditions and distress. These environmental factors often 
result in premature degradation and/or failure. Examples include early-age cracking 
due  to  shrinkage  and  degradation  as  a  result  of  repeated  cycles  of  freezing  and 
thawing, and deterioration due to damaging reactions of chemicals (chloride, sulfate, 
and alkali ions, etc.). An adaptive concrete is one that dynamically and actively ‘‘re-
sponds’’  to  these  stimuli  in  such  a  manner  as  to  reduce  their  impacts.  The  results 
of this research may encourage the industry to have another look at what composi-
tion  is  truly  optimum  for  applications  such  as  pavements  and  bridge  decks,  where 
durability is much more important than strength. 

Doubling  the  Service  Life  of  Concrete.  NIST  is  working  to  have  a  dramatic  effect 
on  the  concrete  industry  through  doubling  the  service  life  of  new  concrete  by  alter-
ing the composition of concrete. One of the main goals of high performance concrete 
is to increase service life. Under most chemical erosion scenarios, the service life of 
concrete depends on its reaction to external chemicals entering it. There are a num-
ber  of  ways  to  significantly  increase  the  service  life  of  concrete  including  reducing 
the  porosity  and  adding  mixtures  to  provide  increased  resistance  to  the  infiltration 
of  chemicals.  Unfortunately,  one  of  the  side  effects  of  these  modifications  is  a  large 
increase  in  the  propensity  for  early-age  cracking,  and  the  desired  barrier  perform-
ance of a dense concrete is easily compromised by the formation of just a few cracks. 
Time  until  the  steel  reinforcement  in  the  concrete  rusts  is  related  to  the  depth  of 
concrete  cover,  so  that  if  you  increase  the  thickness  of  concrete  over  the  steel  by 
50  percent,  you  get  approximately  double  the  expected  service  life.  More  concrete 
covering the rebar may not be feasible because of design constraints, and both addi-
tional  concrete  and  changing  the  composition  to  resist  chemicals  can  add  consider-
able cost to construction. NIST researchers propose a different approach to modifica-
tion  of  the  physical  properties  of  the  concrete  structure  by  using  a  combination  of 
electrical conductivity, ion diffusivity, and viscosity measurements. 

In  addition  to  these  programs,  NIST  cement  Standard  Reference  Materials 
(SRMs)  have  underpinned  product  quality  for  the  cement  industry  for  nearly  50 
years.  The  cement  SRMs  series  has  proven  to  be  essential  to  laboratories  that  cer-
tify  concrete  products  for  performance  and  that  evaluate  mechanisms  for  concrete 
corrosion and failure. 
Summary 

For  107  years,  NIST  research  has  been  critical  to  our  Nation’s  innovation  and 
competitiveness by directly supporting technological advances in broad sectors of the

economy  that  will  quite  literally  define  the  21st  century—as  well  as  improve  the 
safety and quality of life for all our citizens. 

Today,  more  than  at  any  other  time  in  history,  technological  innovation  and 
progress depend on NIST’s unique skills and capabilities. Helping the U.S. to drive 
and  take  advantage  of  the  increased  pace  of  technological  change  is  a  top  priority 
for  NIST.  The  technologies  that  emerge  as  a  result  of  NIST’s  development  of  these 
tools  are  enabling  U.S.  companies  to  innovate  and  remain  competitive.  That  abso-
lutely  includes  the  need  to  develop  both  information  and  better  tools  to  enable  the 
United  States  and  other  nations  to  deal  with  the  potential  and  real  climate-related 
impacts of transportation systems and components. 

To  ensure  that  NIST  programs  deliver  the  highest  impact,  the  Institute,  working 
with our stakeholders in Congress, industry, academia, and other government agen-
cies, will continue to identify the most critical measurement, standards, and techno-
logical challenges—including our efforts that relate to the transportation sector and 
climate change. We look forward to working with you, Mr. Chairman, and Members 
of the Subcommittee, throughout this process. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Dr. Turner.

STATEMENT OF DR. THOMAS C. PETERSON, CLIMATE 

SERVICES DIVISION, NATIONAL CLIMATIC DATA CENTER, 

NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL SATELLITE, DATA, 

AND INFORMATION SERVICE, NATIONAL OCEANIC 

AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION, 

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 

Dr.  PETERSON.  Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens,  Mem-
bers  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  talk  to 
you today on the impacts of climate change on transportation. 

When  the  National  Research  Council  started  focusing  on  this 
topic a few years ago, they didn’t find very much solid information 
on  it.  I’m  pleased  to  be  able  to  report  to  you  today  that  this  is  no 
longer  the  case.  In  addition  to  the  paper  the  National  Research 
Council  commissioned  me  to  write  on  climate  variability  and 
change  with  implications  for  transportation,  earlier  this  year  the 
National  Research  Council  released  its  report  on  the  potential  im-
pacts  of  climate  change  on  U.S.  transportation.  Also,  the  U.S.  Cli-
mate  Change  Science  Program  recently  released  its  report  on  the 
impacts  of  climate  variability  and  change  on  transportation  in  the 
Gulf Coast and a report on weather and climate extremes and how 
they  are  changing.  This  latter  report,  of  which  I’m  one  of  the  au-
thors,  is  relevant  to  transportation  because  transportation  is  par-
ticularly sensitive to changes in extremes, and it was just released 
last Thursday. 

There are five key aspects of climate change that are of greatest 
relevance  to  transportation.  The  first  is  increases  in  very  hot  days 
and heat waves. Very hot days can cause railroad tracks to buckle 
and  road  pavement  to  rut  more  easily.  They  limit  some  outdoor 
maintenance  activities  and  can  force  aircraft  at  higher  elevation 
airports to lighten their loads. 

The  second  is  the  increases  in  Arctic  temperatures  which  are 
causing  a  thawing  of  permafrost  on  which  some  transportation  in-
frastructure was built. Also, the melting of Arctic sea ice is raising 
the  potential  future  opening  of  a  summertime  Arctic  sea  lane, 
which could save thousands of miles on some shipping routes. 

The  third—global  sea  level  is  rising,  and  in  many  parts  of  the 
country this will be noticed when storm waters flood farther inland 
than  they  would  have  without  sea  level  rise.  In  some  areas  of  the 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:04 Feb 13, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\78852.TXT JACKIE

18 

country,  such  as  along  the  Gulf  Coast,  local  sea  level  rise  can  be 
much greater than global rise, due to land subsidence. 

The  fourth  is  increases  in  heavy  precipitation.  Flooding  from 

heavy rain damages many types of transportation infrastructure. 

And  the  last  feature  is  increases  in  hurricane  intensities.  The 
number  of  hurricanes  is  not  projected  to  increase,  but  it  is  likely 
that  their  intensity  will.  Intense  hurricanes  impact  transportation 
infrastructure  through  stronger  winds,  heavier  precipitation,  and 
higher storm surges. 

NOAA  helps  the  Nation’s  transportation  industry  identify  and 
manage  risk  associated  with  climate  variability  and  change  by 
serving as a centralized source of relevant and timely weather and 
climate  information  needed  to  support  commerce.  Specifically, 
NOAA actively supports the transportation industry in three ways. 
The  first  is  through  the  creation  of  basic  data  and  models  that 
transportation  planners  rely  on  for  both  adjusting  to  real-time 
weather  impacts  and  for  making  long-range  infrastructure  deci-
sions. 

The  second  is  through  NOAA’s  participation  in  scientific  assess-
ments  such  as  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change. 
These  reports  synthesize  state-of-the-art  scientific  understanding 
that planners need when looking decades into the future. 

And  the  third  is  outreach  and  education  to  data  users  in  trans-
portation and other sectors. For example NOAA hosts annual data 
user  workshops  which  both  educates  transportation  data  uses  on 
what  relevant  data  and  services  NOAA  can  provide  and  also  edu-
cates NOAA on the needs of the transportation sector. 

User-specific  information  is  needed,  because  climate  change  will 
affect  transportation  and  transportation  infrastructure  in  multiple 
ways over the lifetime of the infrastructure, which can be long. The 
lifetime  of  roadways  is  typically  25  years;  railroads,  50  years;  and 
bridges and underpasses, 100 years. 

When  planning  a  new  bridge,  for  example,  designers  can  take 
into  consideration,  among  other  things,  current  traffic  and  poten-
tial  future  traffic;  current  weather  and  climate,  and  potential  fu-
ture  weather  and  climate.  The  design  of  the  8-mile-long  Confed-
eration  Bridge,  which  connects  Prince  Edward  Island  to  the  Cana-
dian  mainland,  did  just  that  by  taking  into  account  the  possibility 
of a 3-foot rise in sea level due to climate change. 

Many  other  adaptation  measures  can  be  adopted.  For  example, 
there  are  methods  of  laying  railroad  track  that  can  raise  the  tem-
perature at which they buckle; some pavement options are more re-
sistant  to  rutting  during  hot  weather  than  others;  and  larger  cul-
verts  can  be  placed  under  railroads  and  highways  to  accommodate 
heavier precipitation. 

In summary, to help the Nation respond to this challenge, NOAA 
provides  climate  information  to  the  transportation  sector  to  aid  in 
its efficient and safe operation and to help guide infrastructure de-
sign to withstand future climate change. 

The  environmental  information  NOAA  provides  is  crucial  for  de-
cision  makers  in  the  transportation  sector  and  many  other  critical 
areas of the economy every day. 

Thank you, again, for inviting me to testify. I’m happy to answer 

any questions you may have.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR.  THOMAS C.  PETERSON,  CLIMATE SERVICES DIVISION, 
NATIONAL CLIMATIC DATA CENTER,  NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL SATELLITE, 
DATA,  AND INFORMATION SERVICE,  NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC 
ADMINISTRATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 
Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  am  Dr.  Thomas  Peterson,  a 
physical  scientist  with  NOAA’s  National  Climatic  Data  Center.  I  am  pleased  to 
present a summary of our understanding of the impacts of climate change on trans-
portation infrastructure as well as a description of NOAA’s role in creating and pro-
viding  key  information  on  climate  change  to  transportation  decision-makers.  I  am 
an  author  of  a  National  Research  Council  (NRC)  commissioned  paper  released  this 
past  March  on  Climate  Variability  and  Change  with  Implications  for  Transpor-
tation,  along  with  other  colleagues  from  NOAA  and  the  Department  of  Energy’s 
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 

My  testimony  will  draw  from  the  NRC  paper  as  well  as  from  three  other  timely 

reports of which I am an author of the report on climate extremes: 

The  Potential  Impacts  of  Climate  Change  on  U.S.  Transportation  by  the  NRC 
Transportation Research Board (TRB) which was released March 11, 2008. 
Impacts  of  Climate  Variability  and  Change  on  Transportation  Systems  and  In-
frastructure—Gulf  Coast  Study,  U.S.  Climate  Change  Science  Program  (CCSP) 
Synthesis and Assessment Report 4.7, released March 12, 2008. 
Weather  and  Climate  Extremes  in  a  Changing  Climate,  U.S.  Climate  Change 
Science Program Synthesis and Assessment Report 3.3, released June 2008. 

Climate  Change  and  Its  Impacts  on  Transportation  Operation  and 

Infrastructure 

According to the NRC report, five aspects of climate change impact transportation 
operations and infrastructure: (1) increases in very hot days and heat waves, (2) in-
creases in Arctic temperatures, (3) rising sea levels, (4) increases in intense precipi-
tation events, and (5) increases in hurricane intensity. 
Increases in Very Hot Days and Heat Waves 

It is highly likely (greater than 90 percent probability of occurrence) that heat ex-
tremes  and  heat  waves  will  continue  to  become  more  intense,  last  longer,  and  be 
more  frequent  in  most  regions  during  the  twenty-first  century.  In  2007,  the  prob-
ability of having five summer days at or above 43.3 °C (110 °F) in Dallas was about 
2  percent.  In  25  years  the  models  indicate  that  this  probability  increases  to  5  per-
cent; in 50 years, to 25 percent; and by 2099, to 90 percent. Very hot days can have 
an  impact  on  operations;  for  example,  by  limiting  periods  of  outdoor  railroad  track 
maintenance  activity  due  to  health  and  safety  concerns.  High  temperatures  can 
have  a  big  impact  on  aircraft  by  influencing  the  limits  on  payload  and/or  canceling 
flights.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that,  because  warmer  air  is  thinner  (less  dense),  for 
any  given  take-off  speed  the  wings  of  airplanes  create  less  lift  when  temperatures 
are  high.  This  causes  lower  lift-off  load  limits  at  high-altitude  or  hot-weather  air-
ports  with  insufficient  runway  lengths.  Examples  of  impacts  on  infrastructure  in-
clude rail-track deformities, thermal expansion on bridge joints and paved surfaces, 
and concerns regarding the integrity of pavement. 
Increases in Arctic Temperatures 

Arctic  warming  is  virtually  certain  (greater  than  99  percent  probability  of  occur-
rence),  as  temperature  increases  are  expected  to  be  greatest  over  land  and  at  most 
high  northern  latitudes.  As  much  as  90  percent  of  the  upper  layer  of  permafrost 
could  thaw  under  higher  emission  scenarios.  The  greatest  temperature  increases  in 
North America are projected to occur in the winter in northern parts of Alaska and 
Canada  as  a  result  of  feedback  effects  of  shortened  periods  of  snow  cover.  By  the 
end of the twenty-first century, temperatures could increase by as much as 10.0 °C 
(18.0 °F) in the winter and 2.0 °C (3.6 °F) in the summer in the northernmost areas. 
For  the  rest  of  North  America,  the  projected  annual  mean  temperature  increase 
ranges  from  3.0  to  5.0  °C  (5.4  to  9.0  °F),  with  smaller  increases  expected  near  the 
coasts.  Examples  of  impacts  on  operations  include  a  longer  ocean  transport  season 
and  more  ice-free  ports  in  northern  regions,  as  well  as  the  possible  availability  of 
a northern sea route, or a northwest passage. Examples of impacts on infrastructure 
include a short season for ice on roads and thawing of permafrost, which causes sub-
sidence of roads, rail beds, bridge supports, pipelines, and runway foundations.

Rising Sea Levels 

It  is  virtually  certain  (greater  than  99  percent  probability  of  occurrence)  that  sea 
levels will continue to rise in the twenty-first century as a result of thermal expan-
sion  and  loss  of  mass  from  ice  sheets.  The  projected  global  range  in  sea  level  rise 
is  from  0.18  m  (7.1  in)  to  0.59  m  (23.2  in)  by  2099.  These  estimates  do  not  include 
subsidence  in  regions  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  and  uplift  along  portions  of  the  New 
England  and  Alaskan  coasts.  They  also  do  not  include  the  dynamics  of  land  ice  in 
frozen  regions  such  as  Greenland  and  Antarctica,  which  could  increase  the  projec-
tion for sea level rise. The Gulf Coast Study estimates that a relative sea level rise 
of  0.5  to  4  feet  is  quite  possible  for  parts  of  the  Gulf  Coast  within  50  years,  due 
primarily  to  land  subsidence.  With  an  increase  of  4  feet  in  relative  sea  level,  as 
much  as  2,400  miles  of  major  Gulf  Coast  roadways  could  be  permanently  flooded 
without adaptation measures. Other examples of the impacts of sea level rise on op-
erations include more frequent interruptions in coastal and low-lying roadway travel 
and  rail  service  due  to  storm  surge.  Sea  level  rise  will  cause  storm  water  levels  to 
be higher and flow further inland, exposing more infrastructure to destructive wave 
forces.  Higher  storm  water  levels  will  in  turn  require  reassessment  of  evacuation 
routes,  changes  in  infrastructure  design,  siting,  and  development  patterns,  and  the 
potential  for  closure  or  restrictions  at  several  of  the  top  50  airports,  as  well  as  key 
maritime  ports  that  lie  in  coastal  zones.  With  50  percent  of  the  population  living 
in  the  coastal  zone,  these  airports  and  ports  provide  service  to  the  highest-density 
populations in the United States. Examples of impacts on infrastructure include re-
duced clearance under bridges; erosion of road base and bridge supports; inundation 
of  roads,  rail  lines,  subways,  and  airport  runways  in  coastal  areas;  more  frequent 
or severe flooding of underground tunnels and low-lying infrastructure; and changes 
in harbor and port facilities to accommodate higher tides and storm surges. 
Increases in Intense Precipitation Events 

It  is  very  likely  (greater  than  90  percent  probability  of  occurrence)  that  intense 
precipitation  events  will  continue  to  become  more  frequent  in  widespread  areas  of 
the  United  States.  Examples  of  impacts  on  operations  include  increased  flooding  of 
evacuation  routes,  increases  in  weather-related  delays  and  traffic  disruptions,  and 
increases in airline delays due to convective weather. Examples of impacts on infra-
structure include increases in flooding of roadways, rail lines, subterranean tunnels, 
and  runways;  increases  in  scouring  of  pipeline  roadbeds  and  damage  to  pipelines; 
and  increases  in  road  washout,  damages  to  rail-bed  support  structures,  and  land-
slides and mudslides that damage roadways and tracks. 
Increases in Hurricane Intensity 

It  is  likely  (greater  than  66  percent  probability  of  occurrence)  that  tropical  storm 
intensities,  with  larger  peak  wind  speeds  and  more  intense  precipitation,  will  in-
crease. However, it is presently unknown how 21st century tropical storm frequency 
will  change  compared  to  the  historical  data.  Increased  storm  intensity  can  lead  to 
increased  likelihood  of  negative  impacts  to  operations  and  infrastructure,  even 
though  the  number  of  storms  may  not  be  changing.  Examples  of  impacts  of  in-
creased  storm  intensity  on  operations  include  more  frequent  and  potentially  more 
extensive  emergency  evacuations;  and  more  debris  on  roads  and  rail  lines,  inter-
rupting travel and shipping. Examples of impacts on infrastructure include a great-
er probability of infrastructure failures, increased threat to stability of bridge decks, 
and harbor infrastructure damage due to waves and storm surges. 

In addition to the five major aspects of climate change listed above, cold extremes 
are likely to decrease. This change should have mostly positive impacts on transpor-
tation, such as a decrease in ice buildup on marine infrastructure. Also, if the snow 
season  is  shorter,  roadway  maintenance  will  be  easier  and  highway  safety  will  im-
prove. 

In  summary,  climate  change  will  affect  transportation  operations  and  infrastruc-
ture in multiple ways. Transportation infrastructures have long lifetimes. For road-
ways  it  is  typically  25  years,  railroads  50  years,  and  bridges  and  underpasses  100 
years.  When  planning  a  new  bridge,  for  example,  designers  can  take  into  consider-
ation  (among  other  things)  current  traffic,  potential  future  traffic,  current  weather 
and  climate,  and  potential  future  weather  and  climate.  As  illustration  of  such  an 
adaptation measure, the design of the 8 mile long Confederation Bridge, which con-
nects Prince Edward Island to the Canadian mainland, took into account the possi-
bility  of  a  1–m  (3  feet)  sea-level  rise  due  to  climate  change.  Many  other  adaptation 
measures  can  be  adopted.  For  example,  there  are  methods  of  laying  railroad  track 
that raise the temperature at which it will buckle, some pavement options are more 
resistant  to  rutting  during  hot  weather  than  others  and  larger  culverts  can  be 
placed under railroads and highways to accommodate heavier precipitation. To help

the  Nation  respond  to  this  challenge,  NOAA  provides  climate  information  to  the 
transportation  sector  to  aid  in  its  efficient  and  safe  operation,  and  to  help  design 
infrastructure to withstand future climate change. 
NOAA’s Role in Providing Climate Information 

NOAA helps the Nation’s transportation industry identify and manage risks asso-
ciated  with  climate  variability  and  change.  NOAA  supports  the  transportation  in-
dustry  by  serving  as  the  centralized  source  of  relevant  and  timely  weather  and  cli-
mate information needed to support commerce. NOAA’s contributions include histor-
ical  and  real-time  data,  monitoring  and  assessments,  research  and  modeling,  pre-
dictions and projections, decision-support tools. 

For example: 
• NOAA’s  Climate  Prediction  Center  produces  seasonal  forecasts  used  for  plan-
ning  for  transport  on  waterways  and  stockpiling  supplies  such  as  sandbags  or 
salt for roadway (among other functions). 
• NOAA’s  National  Climatic  Data  Center  (NCDC)  develops  national  and  global 
datasets  that  have  been  used  to  maximize  climate  resources  and  minimize  the 
risks posed by climate variability and weather extremes. 
• NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory, working with the Federal Highway 
Administration, develops decision-support software applications that use weath-
er forecasts to generate predictions about roadway conditions and recommenda-
tions  for  the  frequency  of  snow  plowing  and  deicing.  These  efforts  help  to  in-
crease  roadway  safety  and  cost-savings  due  to  reduced  unnecessary  roadway 
maintenance. 
• NOAA’s  Geophysical  Fluid  Dynamics  Laboratory  develops  climate  models  to 
• NOAA’s  Climate  Program  Office  supports  fundamental  research  aimed  at  ful-
filling  NOAA’s  goal  to  understand  and  describe  climate  variability  and  change 
to enhance society’s ability to plan and respond. 
• NOAA’s  National  Weather  Service  and  NCDC  produce  many  publications  that 
describe  the  weather  and  climate  of  the  United  States,  participate  in  national 
and international climate research assessments, and fulfill millions of data cus-
tomer requests each year. 
• NOAA’s  National  Ocean  Service  provides  information  on  local  vertical  land 
movement  and  local  relative  mean  sea  level  trends  and  provides  coastal  man-
agers with coastal resilience tools and training. 

prepare projections of future climate conditions. 

Climate change presents a substantial challenge for future policy and business de-
cision-making,  and  the  demand  for  climate  information  from  NOAA  has  increased 
over  the  past  decade  and  continues  to  grow.  Designers  of  transportation  infrastruc-
ture  can  use  NOAA’s  climate  change  information  to  help  guide  the  design  and  con-
struction  of  new  infrastructure,  so  it  will  withstand  climactic  changes  throughout 
its designed life time. 

NOAA  actively  participates  with  other  Federal  agencies  and  other  organizations, 
and  often  takes  a  leadership  role  in  collaborative  climate  change  assessments  and 
reports.  NOAA  has  worked  on  both  domestic  efforts,  such  as  the  U.S.  Climate 
Change  Science  Program  (CCSP)  report  on  changes  in  extremes  in  North  America, 
and international efforts, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC). These rigorous assessments synthesize the latest climate science to provide 
authoritative  information  on  how  the  climate  has  changed  in  the  past  and  is  ex-
pected  to  change  in  the  future.  These  reports  are  widely  accessed  by  the  transpor-
tation industry. 

NOAA  has  taken  a  proactive  role  in  understanding  the  emerging  data  and  infor-
mation needs facing a variety of data users and decision-makers. As climate services 
continue to evolve, NOAA recognizes that local, regional, state, and private entities 
require  better  information  to  understand  how  their  localities  are  contributing  to, 
will  be  affected  by,  and  can  adapt  to  a  changing  climate.  It  is  NOAA’s  goal  to  pro-
vide  relevant,  user-specific  climate  information  to  meet  this  demand.  NOAA  has 
begun  to  address  this  through  problem-focused  initiatives  developed  collaboratively 
with users, such as the transportation industry. 

For example, in 2007, NCDC hosted a specialized NOAA Data Users workshop to 
identify  the  climate  data  and  information  requirements  of  the  energy,  insurance, 
and transportation sectors, in the context of a changing climate. The workshop also 
explored  how  those  emerging  information  needs  might  guide  future  products  and 
services. The feedback gained from this workshop provided an understanding of the 
needs  of  each  industry,  enabling  NOAA  to  maximize  the  value  of  the  climate  prod-
ucts  and  services  it  delivers.  For  instance,  in  addition  to  NOAA’s  role  as  provider

of  historical,  current  and  modeled  environmental  data,  these  industries  are  inter-
ested in data about the probability of risk associated with a changing climate. 

In  summary,  NOAA  is  striving  to  meet  the  rising  demand  for  climate  data  and 
products,  which  support  decision-making  in  a  number  of  nationally  significant  in-
dustries  including  transportation.  Government  and  industry  leaders  recognize  the 
inherent  value  in  planning  for  future  climate  change  through  an  enhanced  climate 
services partnership between the public and private sectors. 

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  discuss  the  effects  of  climate  change 
on  our  Nation’s  transportation  operations  and  infrastructure.  I  look  forward  to 
working  with  the  Committee  on  any  further  information  you  may  require  for  your 
deliberations on this topic.

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Dr. Peterson. 
My  staff  has  prepared  several  very  technical  questions,  but  I’d 

like to ask other questions, if I may. 

None  of  you  have  mentioned  the  price  of  gasoline  at  the  pumps, 
or  suggested  what  it  should  be  tomorrow  or  the  following  day.  I 
would  venture  to  say  that  if  gas  prices  were  set  at  $2.50  a  gallon 
this  morning,  we  would  not  be  holding  this  hearing,  nor  would 
Presidential  candidates  be  concerned  about  climate  change,  emis-
sions, or greenhouse gases. 

And so, I’ve done some studying, and I’m not certain whether the 
information  I’m  receiving  has  any  bearing.  For  example,  I’ve  been 
told  that  94  percent  of  the  oil  we  consume  in  the  United  States 
comes from countries or dictatorships, 6 percent by private capital-
ists. Does that make any sense—94 percent by countries like Saudi 
Arabia,  Iran,  the  Emirates,  nationally  owned  companies  like  in 
Venezuela;  and  6  percent  by  private  sources—does  that  make 
sense? Any of you. 

[No response.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  We  have  no  idea  where  the  oil  is  coming  from? 
[No response.] 
The CHAIRMAN. I’ve been also told that if all the oil consumed in 
the  United  States  each  day—51  percent  consumed  by  passenger 
cars, 12 percent by trucks, buses, and trains, 7 percent by aircraft, 
24  percent  by  industry,  and  the  rest,  different  places.  Does  that 
make sense? 

Admiral  BARRETT.  Senator,  I—we’re  obviously  more  focused  on 
transportation,  but,  in  response  to  your  first  question,  my  under-
standing  is,  about—something  a  little  less  than  40  percent  of  our 
supply  comes  from  domestic  sources,  and  the  remainder  comes 
from overseas. And I don’t know how to characterize it. I don’t have 
any  information  on  the  nature  of  the  places  we  get  it.  But,  obvi-

ously, Congress, certainly the Administration, is focused on energy 
security  and  energy  independence;  it’s  a  fundamental  issue  for  the 
country. 

With  respect  to  transportation,  what  I  would  offer  you  is  that 
about 95 percent of the fuel used in transportation is based on pe-
troleum in one form or another. There are some amounts that come 
from  the  power  grid—electric,  on  rail—and  there’s  some  amount— 
some  small  amount  comes  from  natural  gas—power  compressors. 
So,  the  net  is  that  our  transportation  systems  are  heavily  reliant 
on fossil fuel, and obviously the supply of that fuel to the effective-
ness of our transportation networks and our economy is vitally im-
portant. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  I’ve  been  told,  by  responsible  people,  that  all  of 
the  major  automobile  manufacturers  in  the  United  States  are  pre-
pared  to  build  automobiles  that  will  run  on  alternative  fuel  once 
we  determine  what  that  alternative  fuel  is  to  be.  Now,  if  we  look 
at  articles,  you’ll  see  one  organization  advocating  electricity;  an-
other,  hydrogen;  another,  biofuel;  one  says  do  what  Brazil  does, 
raise  sugar  cane;  others  say  corn,  et  cetera.  But  yet,  at  the  same 
time,  automobile  manufacturers  say,  ‘‘If  we  decide,  will  we  have 
distribution points?’’ At the present time, less than 1 percent of our 
gas stations provide other-than-petroleum sources. What’s the solu-
tion? 

Admiral BARRETT. Senator, thank you. 
I—from  a  transportation  perspective—again,  to  go  back  to  your 
initial  entry  point,  on  the  fuel  price—market  forces  dramatically 
will affect the transportation systems, and also what types of alter-
natives.  Obviously,  Congress  and  certainly  the  Administration  are 
promoting  alternate  fuels,  renewable  fuels,  new  technologies,  dif-
ferent  technologies,  battery  technologies,  hybrids,  clean  diesel, 
more  efficient  diesel,  a  multitude  of  initiatives.  And  I  don’t  think 
that  the  market  has  settled  out,  in  terms  of  what  the  American 
consumer  will  find  most  efficient  and  affordable  and  functional  for 
their transportation needs. And I think part of what has to happen 
is,  as  manufacturers  in  the  marketplace  bring  these  technologies 
forward, I think the—both the opportunities and the challenges as-
sociated  with  them  in  the  costs  will  surface.  And  I  think  the  mar-
ket will be in the best position to help sort this out over time. 

I  think,  obviously,  from  our  perspective,  we  have  ratcheted  up, 
substantially, the mandated fuel economy standards. As you know, 
in  April  we  proposed  new  CAFE  standards  for  passenger  cars  and 
light  trucks.  That  will  increase—require  an  increase,  if  the  rules 
are  adopted,  of  25  percent  in  the  fuel  economy  of  the  major  U.S. 
vehicle fleets by 2015. That would save you somewhere in the order 
of  521  million  metric  tons  of  CO2.  That’s  a  very  aggressive  stand-
ard.  It  exceeds  what  Congress  set  down  in  the  Energy  Independ-
ence  and  Security  Act.  Congress  mandated  about  a  three-and-a- 
half-percent-a-year  improvement.  The  Administration’s  initial  tar-
get  was  about  4  percent,  and  the  rule  we’ve  proposed  is  about  4 
and  a  half  percent.  And  how  the  manufacturers  get  to  that  stand-
ard,  I  believe,  will  be  a  combination  of  the  types  of  initiatives  you 
spoke about. And I think the market will lean toward the most ef-
fective ones at the end of the day.

The  CHAIRMAN.  I’ve  been  further  advised  by  economists  that  the 
hike in price is not under the control of the marketplace; the mar-
ketplace  supply-and-demand  theory  has  very  limited  impact.  Spec-
ulators,  maybe,  account  for  about  10  percent  of  the  hike.  And  no-
where  can  anyone  suggest  that  the  cost  of  production  has  gone  up 
that  high.  So,  somebody’s  making  a  ton  of  money.  Is  that  assump-
tion correct? 

Admiral  BARRETT.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  what  clearly  has  gone 
on is, the demand, globally, has gone up dramatically over the past 
several  years,  not  just  in  the  United  States—this  is  a  global  mar-
ket;  it’s  gone  up  dramatically  in  places  like  China,  it’s  gone  dra-
matically  up  in  places  like  India,  it  certainly  has  increased  in  this 
country, as well. 

So,  again,  to  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  this  is  fundamentally 
driven by supply and demand. And that’s why, candidly, you know, 
the  solution  to  this  problem  is—we  hear  lots  of  alternatives—we, 
kind of, have to do everything. We’ve got to increase domestic sup-
plies. We’ve got to drive more efficient vehicles. We’ve got to make 
our  systems  more  efficient.  We’ve  got  to  take  a  different  look—I 
know  this  Committee  will—at  transportation,  and  more  flexibility 
in  transportation  funding.  You  know,  the  vehicle  miles  traveled  in 
April of this year are down substantially from where they were last 
year,  driven  by  the  prices  you  mentioned.  And  also,  transit  rider-
ship is going up. People are shifting their choices, if you will, in re-
sponse to these market pressures. And so, I think we need a multi-
faceted  approach,  and  obviously  we’re  going  to  work,  and  continue 
to work, very hard at that. 

But, to the best of my knowledge, sir, this is primarily driven by 
supply  and  demand  over  an  extended  period  of  time.  This  is  not 
new; it’s just—there’s less margin, there’s less flexibility. We’re get-
ting  up  to  the,  kind  of,  limits  of  what  the  available  supply  is,  and 
we  need  to  think  very  seriously  about  expanding  that  supply,  par-
ticularly  domestically,  as  you  mentioned,  in  areas  such  as  offshore 
or  areas  such  as  ANWR.  We  need  to  think  very  seriously  about 
that, and improve our supplies. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much. 
Vice Chairman Stevens? 
Senator STEVENS. Senator Kerry was here ahead of me. 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Kerry? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN F. KERRY, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS 

Senator  KERRY.  Admiral  Barrett,  I’m  a  little  surprised,  first  of 
all,  to  hear  you  extolling  the  Administration’s  initiative  with  re-
spect  to  CAFE  standards,  since  the  Administration  fought  them 
every  step  of  the  way  and  the  level  we’re  going  to  is  well  below 
what  most  of  us  believe  we  ought  to  be  going  to.  And  I  wonder  if, 
since  your  own  figures  on  the  savings  and  the  standards  were  cal-
culated on a $2.25 price—whether now that doesn’t have to be com-
pletely revised, since we’re almost double that. 

Admiral  BARRETT.  Senator,  our  prices  were  calculated  based  on 
the  information  provided  by  Department  of  Energy,  the  standard 
package  prices  that  the  Government  uses.  But,  candidly,  the  man-
date we have in the law was to address the most feasible possible,

given  technology  availability,  as  well  as,  you  know,  the  art  of  the 
possible  and  18-month  cycles  in  advance  for  manufacturers  to  ad-
just their times, and also the cost. 
Senator KERRY. What do you—— 
Admiral BARRETT. The cost—— 
Senator KERRY.—mean by the ‘‘art of the possible’’? 
Admiral BARRETT. In other words, the technology has to be avail-

Senator  KERRY.  Well,  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  says  it 

is, you could double it now. 

Admiral  BARRETT.  Not  speculative.  I  mean,  it  can’t—there’s  also 

a huge cost factor. The cost of the standards we—— 

Senator KERRY. Come back to the—— 
Admiral BARRETT. Yes, sir. 
Senator KERRY.—to the expectations. I mean, the National Acad-
emy  says  that  a  lot  of  people  out  there—you  can  get  170  miles  to 
a gallon tomorrow if you use a battery and plug-in and hybrid. 

Admiral  BARRETT.  Well,  and  I  think  the  manufacturers  are  try-

ing to bring those forward. But, I don’t think—— 

Senator  KERRY.  Do  you  think  the  market  is  moving  fast  enough 

to respond to that? 

increasingly rapidly. 

Admiral  BARRETT.  I  think  it’s  moving  very—I  think  it’s  moving 

Senator KERRY. And—— 
Admiral  BARRETT.  And  I  think  you’ll  see  more  increase  in  that. 

And——

Admiral BARRETT. I think the market is moving faster—— 
Senator  KERRY.  Do  you  think  we’d  be  better  off  if  the  market 

Admiral  BARRETT.  I  think  the  market  will  move  in  line  with  the 

technology. I just—— 

Senator KERRY. No. No, no, no. 
Admiral BARRETT. There’s a cost—— 
Senator  KERRY.  Would  we  be  better  off  as  a  country  if  the  mar-

ket moved faster? 

Admiral  BARRETT.  Well,  I  think  there  are  tradeoffs.  The  cost  to 
the consumer, of what we have proposed—not anything further, as 
you  discuss;  what  we  have  proposed—is  somewhere  between  $300 
and  $900  a  vehicle.  That’s  substantial  impact,  also,  that  needs  to 
be factored in. 

Senator KERRY. But we—— 
Admiral BARRETT. I also can’t—— 
Senator  KERRY.—we  did  factor  it  in.  In  2004,  I  proposed  a 

$4,000-per-vehicle credit to the consumer. 

Admiral BARRETT. Well—— 
Senator KERRY. That’s a worthwhile tax expenditure, isn’t it? 
Admiral  BARRETT.  Well,  it—I  think  that’s  an  issue  for  the  Con-
gress.  I—what  I  also—I  just—candidly,  Senator,  I  appreciate  your 
interest in this, and I understand the concern you’re raising. What 
we  put  out  as  a  proposal—we’re  open  for  comments  until  July  1— 
we  will  take  seriously  the  feedback.  And  obviously,  we  will  look  at

what’s going on in the market and what’s going on with fuel as we 
consider a final rule. 

Senator KERRY. Well, the final rule is predicated on a notion that 
we’re  going  to  try  to  achieve  that  standard  by  2030,  isn’t  that  cor-
rect? 

Admiral BARRETT. Well, it’s staged, so actually a lot of the stand-
ard will be achieved by 2015, and then 2020 is the out year for the 
final standard—2020. 

Senator KERRY. China’s going to achieve that standard next year. 
Admiral BARRETT. I’m not—I’m not aware of that. China has no-

where near the number of vehicles we have, either, sir. 
Senator KERRY. They’re growing rapidly, aren’t they? 
Admiral BARRETT. They are growing. But, they’re still—— 
Senator  KERRY.  Doesn’t  it  matter  that  they  think  they  can  put 
vehicles  in  place  that  can  establish  that  standard  by  next  year? 
What does that say about us? 

Admiral  BARRETT.  Again,  we’ve  proposed  what  we  believe  is  fea-
sible and achievable, in line with the law. We’ve actually exceeded 
the  requirement  in  the  law.  But,  I  don’t  know,  specifically,  what 
the Chinese—— 

Senator  KERRY.  Where’s  the  Administration’s  proposal  with  re-

spect to high-speed rail, and rail as a whole, in the country? 

Admiral  BARRETT.  Well,  I  think  rail—a  number  of  things  are 
going on. Certainly, freight rail is a hugely efficient way of moving 
freight. It’s near capacity across the country. 

Senator  KERRY.  And  where’s  the  proposal  to  expand  capacity  on 

high-speed rail? 

Admiral  BARRETT.  Well,  again,  I  think  that’s  something  that, 
again,  is  in  a  research-and-development  area.  I  think  Congress  is 
obviously  interested,  and  we  are  interest,  also—as  well.  But,  the 
technology for some of the high-speed rail is enormously expensive. 
And  unlike  in  some  other  places,  we’re  using  existing  infrastruc-
ture.  You  know,  it’s—it  takes  a  lot  of  work.  And  it  would  probably 
be feasible only in very heavily trafficked corridors. 

Senator  KERRY.  Well,  we  have  some  of  those,  Mr.  Barrett.  We 
have  trains  today  that  could  go  150  miles  an  hour,  and  they  can’t 
go  150  miles  an  hour  because  the  Baltimore  Tunnel  won’t  allow 
them to, because the—— 

Admiral BARRETT. You’re right. 
Senator  KERRY.—bridges  won’t  allow  them  to.  And  you  don’t 

have any proposal whatsoever to fix those things. 

Admiral BARRETT. Well, I think, again, investment in infrastruc-

ture is enormously important. 

Senator  KERRY.  Well,  of  course  it  is.  That’s  what  I’m  talking 

about. But, where’s the proposal? 

Admiral BARRETT. For high-speed rail? We—— 
Senator KERRY. For any of these things. 
Admiral  BARRETT.  Well,  we  have  proposed—we,  in  fact,  have 
spent enormous amounts of money on improving transit infrastruc-
ture, improving highway infrastructure, and trying to bring market 
forces to bear to improve the flow, to eliminate the congestion. And 
I think the passengers are moving, based on those prices. 

Senator KERRY. Well, I have to tell you that it’s more than pass-

ing disappointing.

Let me ask you what is the guiding operative management target 
under which Department of Transportation, Department of Energy, 
and  others  are  proceeding  with  respect  to  global  climate  change? 
This  hearing  is  obviously  on  global  climate  change.  This  is  the  20- 
year anniversary of Jim Hansen coming up here and telling us that 
it’s  happening  now,  20  years  ago.  Now  we  know  it’s  happening, 
even  to  a  greater  degree  and  faster  than  was  predicted.  I’d  like  to 
know  what  the  operative  estimate  is  of  your  Department  as  to 
where  a  potential,  sort  of,  catastrophic  tipping  point  may  be,  and 
how fast you have to respond to these infrastructure challenges. 

And I do that particularly in light of the fact that there are pre-
dictions,  for  instance,  that—just  last  week,  The  Washington  Post 
ran a story headlined, ‘‘Extreme Weather to Increase with Climate 
Change,’’  and,  ‘‘Our  scientists  now  agree  that  the  droughts  are 
going  to  get  drier,  the  storms  are  going  to  get  stormier,  the  floods 
are going to get deeper with climate change.’’ That’s a quote. They 
warn of more flooding, like we’re seeing in Iowa today, more heavy 
downpours,  more  droughts.  ‘‘In  March,  the  Department  of  Trans-
portation found that the Gulf Coast would put a substantial portion 
of  the  region’s  transportation  infrastructure  at  risk.  Storm  surges 
in  the  Gulf  Coast  will  flood  more  than  half  the  area’s  major  high-
ways, almost half of the rail miles, 29 airports, and virtually all of 
the ports.’’ 

So, given these predictions, which keep coming at us, under what 
time-frame  do  you  believe  you’re  operating,  in  terms  of  the  infra-
structure expenditures necessary to respond to these threats? 

Admiral BARRETT. Senator, I think the answer is, first, you—and 
you  highlighted  it—the  Gulf  Coast  study  we  did  is  regionally  fo-
cused.  With  respect  to  transportation  infrastructure,  the  first  step 
is  understanding  the  potential  implications  in  local  areas,  because 
they  vary.  And  a  follow-on  to  that  study  will  involve  the  East 
Coast.  But,  the  impacts  will  be  different.  Gulf  Coast,  obviously, 
you’ve  got  the  potential  for  sea  level  rise,  temperature  changes, 
storm intensity, all affecting the things you do. So, I think the first 
thing we are trying to do is understand better, and particularly re-
gionally, what the actual implications might be so that people who 
repair and renew and expand transportation infrastructure, which, 
to a large extent, rests in the states, as well as the Federal Govern-
ment,  can  adjust  to  that  over  time  as  they  repair  and  renew  and 
build out. 

But, I think there is no timeline, specific, but we clearly need to 
understand what needs to be done, and, as we plan new projects— 
for example, we had instrumented, in the Gulf region, a cable-stay 
bridge  when  Katrina  came  through.  We  have  the  data  from  the 
wind-loading  on  that  bridge,  and  we’re  trying  to—and  we  are  as-
sessing  the  implications  of  that  for  bridge  design  across  the  coun-
try. And I think you will see adjustments to how we design, build, 
and install bridges to withstand climate better, and the impacts of 
climate change, whether it’s increased storms or higher river levels. 
And so, the technology to do this is within our capability. We will 
make the adjustments as rapidly as we can. But, there’s no specific 
time.  It’s  a  serious  issue,  it’s  got  our  attention,  and,  working  with 
the Congress, we are doing our very best to address it.

Senator  KERRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  my  time  is  up,  and  I  appreciate 

your indulgence here. 

I’d  just  close  by  saying  there  really  is  a  specific  time,  sir.  Jim 
Hansen, who is hugely respected, first warned of this, 20 years ago, 
and  we’ve  been  slow  to  respond  to  it.  The  science  is  only  coming 
back  stronger  and  more  rapidly  and  greater.  Jim  Hansen  has  now 
revised—right  now,  today,  in  these  days—is  warning  us  that  we 
have  less  cushion  than  the  scientists  thought  when  they  revised 
the cushion from several years ago. So, it’s gone from 550 parts per 
million  of  greenhouse  gases,  to  450,  and  now,  they  believe,  less 
than that. 

There  is  a  time-frame  here.  They’ve  said  we’ve  got  10  years  to 
get this right. And if you’re saying to us, you know, there’s no time- 
frame, and that’s, sort of, the attitude of where we are, I think this 
is  going  to  be  very  difficult  to  get  done.  And  I  think  it’s,  frankly, 
inappropriate,  that  that  is  where  a  major  department,  the  Depart-
ment  of  Transportation,  stands  today.  I  think  there  ought  to  be 
vast  commitments  in  incentives,  tax  incentives,  grants,  expendi-
tures to put America on a course, here, to deal with this. 

Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Vice Chairman Stevens? 

STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Senator STEVENS. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
I  would  ask  that  you  put  my  statement  in  the  record  that  I 
would  have  made  if  I  had  gotten  here  on  time.  I  do  apologize  for 
being late. 

The CHAIRMAN. Without objection. 
Senator  STEVENS.  And  I’m  constrained  to  say  that  I  think  my 
friend from Massachusetts seems to think that we ought to change 
the world overnight. We did adopt a new CAFE standard, the first 
since  the  1970s;  and  we’re  implementing  it.  China  has  not  called 
in  the  cars  that  are  polluting.  They’ve  set  new  standards  for  their 
new vehicles, if and when they get them. 

I  think  the  problem  we  have  to  deal  with  is  the  impact  of  some 
of these changes on the individual American and on our states. Our 
state  had,  as  I’ve  said  in  this  statement,  a  report  that  the  effects 
of  climate  change  stand  to  increase  our  maintenance  and  replace-
ment  costs  for  public  infrastructure  by  $6  billion  over  the  next  20 
years. Now, we’re a small state. The impact of that on the taxpayer 
and upon the people of our state is going to be overwhelming if we 
have to start meeting some immediate standards. The question has 
got to be, What do we do first? 

Now,  I  applaud  you,  Mr.  Barrett,  for  what  you’ve  said,  in  terms 
of  the  attempts  that  the  administration  is  making  to  get  people  to 
move,  across  the  board.  Nobody  can  do  it  overnight,  all  at  once. 
But,  I  think  the  CAFE  standards  that  we’ve  established  are  really 
a  step  in  the  right  direction.  We’re  trying  to  find  ways  to  really 
measure  the  effects  of  alternative  energies  and  how  much  we  can 
afford to move, and how quickly we can move on those. 

I  would  say,  those  people  who  have  opposed  our  exploration  in 
the  Arctic  of  Alaska  and  of  developing  our  resources  offshore  have

put us behind the eight ball right now. If President Clinton hadn’t 
vetoed  the  ANWR  bill  in  1995,  we  would  be  producing  an  extra  2 
million barrels of oil a day, and that income to our state and to our 
Nation would enable us to be making some of the changes that we 
have  to  make.  The  only  way  we  can  make  them  now  is  to  raise 
taxes. And how do you raise taxes on people that are currently now 
paying for oil at $140 a barrel instead of $8 a barrel, which is what 
we paid when we completed the Alaska Oil Pipeline? 

Now,  Mr.  Secretary,  what  I’d  really  like  to  know  is  something 
different,  and  that  is,  have  you  conferred  with  the  people  in  the 
aviation industry? How are they going to meet these changes? The 
cost  of  aviation  fuel  is  going  up  as  rapidly,  or  more  rapidly,  than 
that for automobiles. In my state, 70 percent of the destinations in 
my  State  can  be  reached  only  by  air,  and  we’re  seeing  enormous 
change.  National  airline  after  national  airline  is  canceling  their 
flights to my state. We’ll be isolated in another 2 years. Now, what 
can we do to meet the problems of these international and national 
airlines? 

Admiral  BARRETT.  Senator,  thank  you.  I  think  they  are  enor-
mously  challenged.  At  the  same  time,  they  are  leading  American 
industry  with  respect  to  technology.  And,  as  I  indicated  in  my 
statement,  they  have  actually  been  able  to  improve  their  fuel  effi-
ciency and reduce their carbon emissions when other international 
airlines—EU,  for  example—have  not  been  able  to  do  it;  they’re 
moving in the opposite direction. 

We  clearly—one  of  the  principal  things  we’re  doing  is  try  to  ac-
celerate  bringing  forward  what  is  commonly  termed  ‘‘next  genera-
tion  technology’’  to  allow  the  management  of  the  air  traffic  system 
that  we  operate—the  FAA  operates—to  allow  them  to  operate 
much  more  efficiency  and  reduce  their  carbon  burn.  We  are  pro-
viding  grants,  through  our  Airport  Improvement  Programs,  to 
bring  ground  equipment  forward  that  uses  less  fuel.  But,  avia-
tion—a lot of the burn is in the routes, it’s getting them the ability 
to get from point to point more efficiently. We’ve changed the rout-
ing in the air, we’ve brought forward—allowed them to space—safe-
ly,  I  might  add—closer  together  at  certain  altitudes.  We  have 
worked closely with the Department of Defense to open up military 
airspace  as  part  of  the  national  airspace  when  we’ve  had  holiday 
traffic.  Again,  it  reduces  the  fuel  burn  to  the  airlines.  We’re  work-
ing very closely with them to try and do everything we can to mini-
mize  the  burden  the  Government  puts  on  them,  in  terms  of  man-
aging their flight profiles. 

And—but,  I  don’t  want  to  underestimate  it.  Their  model,  their 
business  model  of  your  major  carriers  is  not  built  on  135-dollar-a- 
barrel  fuel,  and  it’s  a  substantial  challenge.  And  we’re  going  to 
move, again, as quickly as we can. The FAA certainly is. 

As  an  example,  one  of  the  issues  we’re  working  with  the—with 
RNAV—and  you’re  familiar  with  these,  Senator—continuous-de-
scent  approaches  to  allow  airlines  in—where  we  can  do  it  safely— 
to  come  down  on  a  direct  approach,  basically  throttle  back  into  an 
airport.  FAA  is  moving  testbed  into  Florida  to  bring  this  forward. 
We’ve  done  tests  in  Louisville  to  work  incrementally  to  reduce  the 
fuel  burn.  It’s  that  simple.  There’s  a  direct  line  between  fuel  burn 
and carbon footprint and cost.

Airlines are offloading weight, as you know. We’re managing that 
for  safety.  That’s  another  concern.  As  these  things  are  taken—as 
these measures are taken, we’re working very closely with them to 
make  sure  their  flying  remains  as  it  is,  a  very  safe  mode  of  trans-
portation. 

Senator STEVENS. Well, that’s good. I’m glad to hear it. 
Have  you  analyzed  the  effect  of  cap-and-trade  legislation  on 

building our enormous natural-gas pipeline to Alaska? 

Admiral BARRETT. Not specifically, no. But, I would say that cap- 
and-trade—we’ve  done  a  couple  of  things  in  the  Department.  We 
have tried—for example, Pipeline Safety Administration—to look at 
ways to move gas through lines at higher volume and get more effi-
ciency out of an existing line; move more—increase the capacity. 

But,  cap-and-trade,  with  respect  to  transportation  systems,  has 
to  be  approached  very  carefully.  Mobile  sources  and  sources  that 
move  product  are  not  the  same  as  power  plants.  And,  again,  the 
cost  structure  of  the  business  models  are  totally  different.  And  if 
we  are  not  very  careful  about  improving—and  we’re  global—if  we 
impose,  carelessly,  cap-and-trade  regimes  in  transportation,  it  can 
have a very negative, even devastating effect. So, we haven’t looked 
specifically at your question. I’d be glad to, and provide some feed-
back to you. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  I  wish  you  would,  because  I  was  told 
that the application of cap-and-trade, the credits that would be re-
quired  during  the  construction  phase  alone  for  a  pipeline  of  that 
size,  really,  it  would  be  the  largest  project  in  the  history  of  the 
United  States  financed  by  private  capital—that,  for  all  the  trucks 
and  everything  else  that  are  going  to  be  used  in  this  construction 
phase over a period of 5–6 years, that the costs would be increased 
by  at  least  20  percent  if  they  had  to  go  out  and  buy  credits  under 
that  concept  for  the  pollution  that’s  taking  place,  notwithstanding 
the fact that the completion of the line would bring about the deliv-
ery  of  an  enormous  amount  of  new  additional  natural  gas,  which 
is not as polluting as the coal that people are using in many of the 
areas that would be supplied. There doesn’t seem to be any leeway 
for  those  who  want  to  move  to  try  and  get  a  more  efficient  type  of 
energy  available.  I  think  that  cap-and-trade  legislation  would  kill 
that pipeline. 

Admiral  BARRETT.  Sir,  no,  I  agree,  in  general.  Cap-and-trade  in 
transportation  is  very  treacherous  and  needs  to  be  looked  at  very 
closely. 

Senator STEVENS. Thank you very much. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Senator STEVENS. I do have some questions to be submitted to— 

I’m going to be going out of the hearing after—— 

[The prepared statement of Senator Stevens follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

The  effects  of  climate  change  on  the  transportation  sector  is  an  important  issue, 

particularly in Alaska, and I thank the Chairman for holding this hearing. 

The  University  of  Alaska  recently  released  a  report  on  potential  impacts  of  cli-
mate  change  on  transportation  and  public  infrastructure  in  Alaska.  The  report 
found that the effects of climate change stand to increase maintenance and replace-

31 

ment  costs  of  public  infrastructure  in  Alaska  by  up  to  20  percent,  or  an  additional 
$6 billion over the next two decades. 

We  can  mitigate  these  impacts  and  reduce  costs  through  study  and  research  on 
improving  the  planning,  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  transportation  sys-
tems. 

We  must  also  explore  the  potential  for  increased  energy  efficiency  and  reduced 
greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  the  transportation  sector.  Recently,  I  have  supported 
legislation  to  increase  the  corporate  average  fuel  economy  standards  for  auto-
mobiles. 

Conservation  measures  and  alternative  energies  need  to  be  part  of  our  long-term 
strategy,  but  the  idea  that  we  can  transition  from  fossil  fuels  anytime  in  the  next 
20 years is not realistic. 

Worldwide  oil  demand  is  expected  to  increase  to  116  million  barrels  a  day  by 
2030.  We  do  need  to  explore  ways  to  ease  our  dependence  on  fossil  fuels  in  the 
transportation sector, but the investments required to make this transition are enor-
mous. 

This  is  why  I  continue  to  argue  that  revenues  from  new  domestic  sources  of  oil, 
including  ANWR,  should  be  devoted  to  climate  change  adaptation  and  alternative 
energy development to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. 

I welcome our witnesses today, including Mead Treadwell who has traveled all the 

way from Anchorage to be here, and I look forward to your testimony. 

The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, so ordered. 
Senator Carper? 

STATEMENT OF HON. THOMAS R. CARPER, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM DELAWARE 

Senator CARPER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
To  our  witnesses,  welcome.  Thank  you  for  joining  us  today,  for 

your testimony, and for responding to our questions. 

I  just  want  to  follow  up  on  a  couple  of  comments  that  our  col-
leagues  have  made  in  some  discussion  a  bit  earlier  on  CAFE.  The 
CAFE  legislation,  which  I  think  all  of  us  here  worked  on  to  enact, 
has  the  practical  effect  of,  not  literally  but  figuratively,  removing 
about 60 million vehicles off of our roads, in terms of reduced CO2 
emissions,  by  2020.  That’s  no  small  accomplishment.  If  we  don’t 
figure  out  how  to  drive  less,  though,  instead  of  how  to  drive  more, 
it will be an accomplishment for naught. 

We  were  speculating  earlier  about  whether  or  not  we  needed  to 
go  further  than  CAFE,  further  than  35  miles  per  gallon  by  2020. 
My  guess  is  that  market  forces  will  get  us  there  a  lot  faster  than 
the  legislation  that  we’ve  passed.  And  I  think  that  will  be  a  good 
thing. 

I  have  a  couple  of  questions,  and  I  have  a  statement  for  the 

record, if I could, more effective, but a couple of questions. 

Senator  CARPER.  And  the  first  question,  I  think  I’ll  direct  it  to 
Dr.  Peterson  to  start  off  with  and  others  might  respond,  if  they 
wish. The transportation sector is responsible, I believe, for almost 
one-third  of  our  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  making  it  among  the 
largest source in our economy; I think, second only to power plants. 
How  should  the  U.S.  surface  transportation  policy  be  updated  to 
support the goals of climate change legislation? 

Dr.  PETERSON.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  respond  to  that 
question, but it’s somewhat out of my area of expertise. We’ve been 
focusing  on  how  climate  change  will  impact  transportation,  rather 
than  focusing  on  how  transportation  is  impacting  climate  change 
and  what  should  be  the  change  in  policies  should  be  with  regard 
to transportation.

32 

Senator  CARPER.  Let  me  ask  a  slightly  different  question,  but  a 
related  one.  Should  the  transportation  sector  be  responsible  for 
one-third  of  the  emission  reductions  for  CO2 that  are  necessary  to 
meet targets that scientists say is necessary? 

Dr. PETERSON. Should transportation be required for one-third of 
the  reductions  or  a  different  amount?  Again,  that’s  out  of  my  area 
of expertise. But, as we look forward—— 

Senator  CARPER.  Once,  in  another  hearing,  I  asked  a  witness  a 
question like that, and it was beyond his area of expertise, and he 
just said to me, ‘‘Next question?’’ 

[Laughter.] 
Senator CARPER. You can—— 
Dr. PETERSON. Next question? 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  CARPER.  Let  me  just  bounce  that  same  question  off  of 

Mr.  Barrett,  you  want  to  take  a  shot  at  that,  and  we’ll  give  Dr. 

Mr. Barrett. 

Peterson a pass, here. 

Dr. PETERSON. Thank you. 
Admiral  BARRETT.  Senator,  thank  you  very  much.  And  I’d  agree 
with your observation, by the way, that the market does—seems to 
be  working.  And  as  gas  prices  are  going  up,  we  are  seeing  shifts 
in  behavior  that  affect—and,  over  time,  will  affect  even  more— 
transportation. 

But, I think—one way to approach it is, I think we clearly recog-
nize  it  and  desire  to  reduce  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  that 
comes from transportation. We can improve the energy efficiency of 
transportation vehicles, such as with CAFE. We can substitute en-
ergy sources that are lower in emission—alternate fuels, renewable 
fuels.  We  can  do  things,  like  we’re  doing  with  congestion  pricing, 
that  improve  the  flow—better  technology,  signal  timing—that  le-
verage  the  systems  we’ve  got;  and  then  reduce,  you  know,  how 
much motorized activity goes on—vehicles—and how much. 

But, the intermodal piece is important, too. I mean, you’re seeing 
shifts to rail, to ships, to ways that are intrinsically more efficient, 
and the market is driving that. I don’t know if that’s what—respon-
sive. But, I think the goal is to drive it down, across the board. 

Senator  CARPER.  I  take  the  train  back  and  forth  to  Washington 
almost  every  day.  I  live  in  Delaware  and  I  don’t  get  off  the  train 
at  BWI,  but  if  I  wanted  to,  I  could  literally  take  a  bus  from  my 
house  to  the  train  station,  catch  the  train,  take  the  train  to  BWI, 
get  off,  take  a  shuttle  to  the  terminal,  and  then  fly  to  just  about 
any place around the world. We don’t always make it easy for peo-
ple  to  get  from  a  train  to  an  airport  terminal,  but  we  do  at  BWI, 
and I think we do the same thing at Newark, Delaware. 

Let me just do a follow-up, if I can, Mr. Barrett. I think, in your 
testimony, you talked about congestion pricing, and you mentioned 
it  just  a  moment  ago,  as  well,  and  other  travel  demand  manage-
ment  techniques,  and  I  missed  your  statement,  but  I  believe  you 
may  have  cited  Germany’s  experience  with  this.  But,  as  I’m  sure 
you know, Germany has invested a lot of money in transit. They’ve 
invested  a  fair  amount  of  money  in  other  driving  alternatives  that 
are not always available in American communities, like what I de-
scribed  for  my  own  community  for  myself  if  I  wanted  to  fly  out  of 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:04 Feb 13, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\78852.TXT JACKIE

33 

BWI. But, without the safe, convenient driving alternatives, do peo-
ple  really  have  the  kind  of  options  that  they  need,  other  than,  in 
some  cases,  paying  the  tolls,  or,  in  other  cases,  changing  the  time 
of their commute, which they might like to do, but their employers 
may  have  another  idea  about  that?  And  doesn’t  this  severely  limit 
the  potential  benefit  of  congestion  pricing,  which,  frankly,  I  still 
find is an interesting option, but it’s not without its problems? 

Admiral BARRETT. No, I think it—one of the options it does is po-
tentially does create funds to invest in other alternatives. You men-
tioned  Germany,  but  if  you  look  at  London  or  you  look  at  Stock-
holm,  you  look  at  some  of  the  other  examples  where  they’ve  put, 
for  example,  cordon-type  pricing  approaches  in,  one  of  the  things 
they do with the funds they gain is invest it to improve transit and 
improve  the  alternatives  that  you’re  speaking  about,  so  that,  you 
know,  ultimately,  the  publicly  has  more  choice  available  to  them. 
And certainly, I think the idea of providing more flexibility to both 
State and local officials as they make those regional investment de-
cisions is important. 

Senator CARPER. All right. Thank you. 
This  could  be  a  question  for  any  of  our  panelists,  but  transit 
agencies  across  the  country  are  struggling  to  meet  the  increasing 
demands  resulting  from  high  gas  prices.  This  is  actually  a  good- 
news  story,  I  think,  because  we’ve  seen  SEPTA  ridership  growing 
in  my  own  region  of  the  country,  by  5  to  10  percent;  we’ve  seen 
some  transit  agencies  with  as  much  as  20–25  percent  growth  in 
ridership. Ridership on Amtrak is up, I think, this year to date, by 
about 10 to 15 percent; last year, it was up by close to 10 percent, 
as  well.  But,  transit  agencies  across  the  country  are  struggling  to 
meet  increasing  demands  resulting  from  high  gas  prices,  as  you 
know.  And,  at  the  same  time,  more  people  are  turning  to  transit 
as  a  clean,  affordable  way  to  travel.  In  fact,  the  typical  public 
transportation  user,  on  average,  needs  to  buy,  I’m  told,  about  half 
as  much  gasoline  as  a  person  without  access  to  transit.  And  I 
would  just  ask  anyone  on  this  panel,  is  the  Federal  investment  in 
public transportation adequate to serve our public in an era of high 
gas prices? 

Dr. Turner, I can tell you’re dying to answer that question. 
[Laughter.] 
Dr. TURNER. Well, sir, your perceptive powers are amazing. 
[Laughter.] 
Dr.  TURNER.  This  is  a  little  bit  out  of  our  area  of  expertise,  but 
let  me  just  describe  for  you  the  things  that  we’re  doing  at  NIST. 
We’re  basically  attacking  this  at  three  levels,  starting  with  the 
atmosphere.  We  are  working  with  NOAA,  which  is  a  sister  agency 
of ours within the Department of Commerce, to make very accurate 
measurements  of  the  gases  that  are  in  the  atmosphere,  to  help 
with  calibrating  satellite  instruments  and  to  make  very  accurate 
measurements of the solar radiance on the atmosphere, and also to 
look  at  the  impact  of  aerosols,  because  NOAA  needs  that  informa-
tion  to  put  into  their  climate  models  to  make  the  predictions  that 
are necessary. 

We’re  also  looking  at  some  very  near-term  things,  such  as 
biofuels  and  hydrogen  as  alternatives  in  the  mix  that  people  will 
have.  We’ve  been  very  active  with  Brazil  and  the  EU  to  develop 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:04 Feb 13, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\78852.TXT JACKIE

34 

standards and methods of measuring, to assure that commerce can 
take place equitably in biofuels. 

The  U.S.  auto  manufacturers  have  also  been  a  very  significant 
user  of  our  neutron  facility,  which  is  used  to  improve  fuel  cells, 
which  support  a  hydrogen  economy.  We’re  also  working  to  tackle 
the  problem  of  embrittlement  that  hydrogen  has  on  metals  that 
would be used in a pipeline. So, we’re looking at that also. 

One  of  the  other  things  that  we’re  doing  is  to  look  at  what  can 
be  done  with  respect  to  cement.  It’s  something  so  basic,  so  funda-
mental, but it turns out that, for each ton of cement produced, you 
produce  a  ton  of  carbon  dioxide.  And  so,  one  of  the  things  we’re 
looking at is the replacement of cement, in manufacturing concrete, 
with  fly  ash.  Fly  ash  is  a  byproduct  of  electricity  production,  and 
so,  any  increase  that  we  can  have  in  the  production  of  concrete, 
using  fly  ash  as  opposed  to  cement,  would  have  immediate  impact 
on the carbon footprint that’s out there. 
Senator CARPER. All right, thank you. 
Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  my  time  has  expired.  Could  I  just  add  a 

quick P.S., if I may? I won’t ask another question. 

When  I  was  Governor  of  Delaware,  if  we  wanted  to  build  a  road 
or a highway or a bridge, the Federal Government paid for 80 per-
cent of it. Eighty percent. If we wanted to do a transit investment, 
the Federal Government provided 50 percent of it. If we wanted to 
invest—if it made more sense to put in intercity passenger rail, the 
Federal  Government  provided  nothing.  And  I’m  sure  we  made  in-
vestment decisions, that were probably wrong decisions, because of 
the  difference  in  those  modes  of—or  measures  of  Federal  support. 

Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Carper follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. THOMAS CARPER, U.S. SENATOR FROM DELAWARE 
This  is  a  very  important  hearing,  one  that  I  hope  will  be  repeated  in  the  other 

committees with jurisdiction over transportation. 

The  transportation  sector  is  responsible  for  30  percent  of  this  Nation’s  carbon 
emissions  and  growing.  Yet  emissions  from  the  transportation  sector  can  be  more 
difficult to address than stationary sources. 

This is because we have millions of tiny, mobile smokestacks manufactured by dif-
ferent  companies,  fueled  with  fuel  from  different  companies  and  sources  and  oper-
ated by millions of different people with varying demands and needs. 

No matter the challenge, it is an area we must address in order to meet our car-

bon reduction targets and we already have the tools to do so. 

There  are  three  broad  areas  that  must  be  dealt  with:  the  efficiency  of  vehicles, 
the  carbon  content  of  fuels  and  how  much  people  drive.  Last  year,  this  committee 
took  the  lead  in  passing  a  bill  to  increase  the  fuel  efficiency  of  cars  from  25  mpg 
to 35 mpg by 2020. 

We also promoted the use of alternative fuels by passing a renewable fuels stand-
ard, requiring the production of 21 billion gallons of advanced renewable fuels, also 
by 2020. 

The final area that needs some attention is making our transportation system less 
congested  and  more  efficient.  This  means  fixing  bottlenecks,  intermodalism  and 
more options to driving. 

American  ingenuity  is  going  to  bring  us  the  Chevrolet  Volt  in  the  very  near  fu-
ture—a  car  that  will  go  640  miles  without  needing  to  be  recharged  or  filled  up. 
There  are  also  companies  hard  at  work  developing  renewable  fuels.  One  example 
is  Coskata,  a  U.S.  company  that  says  it  will  be  able  to  produce  ethanol  from  prac-
tically any source—including garbage, plant waste and used tires—for $1 per gallon. 
Now we, in government, need to show the same amount of ingenuity and address 

the efficiency of the transportation system we have built.

There  is  much  we  can  learn  from  state  and  local  governments  that  have  already 
begun  to  invest  in  alternatives  to  driving,  saving  their  constituents  thousands  of 
dollars when the cost of gas goes up. 

Some  states  and  local  governments  have  found  that  when  transportation  and  de-
velopment  decisions  are  made  together  the  whole  system  works  better,  people  save 
money on transportation, property values rise and pollution decreases. 

To  support  these  important  efforts,  the  Federal  Government  will  have  to  work 
across  agencies  and  modes  of  travel  to  find  the  most  effective  way  to  move  people 
and freight. 

I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  our  witnesses,  particularly  from  the  Department 
of Transportation, about how we can break down these silos and find ways to make 
it  safe  and  convenient  for  people  and  goods  to  get  where  they  are  going,  whether 
it is by car or truck, train, plane, ship or all of the above. 

We  will  have  to  address  that  here  in  Congress,  as  well.  In  the  Senate,  transpor-
tation  is  handled  by  three  different  committees—air  and  rail  in  this  Committee, 
highways at Environment and Public Works and transit at Banking. I am fortunate 
enough to serve on all three. 

As we develop a climate change bill and prepare to reauthorize the surface trans-
portation  program,  we  need  to  bring  these  three  committees  together  to  consider 
how  to  move  people  and  goods,  not  just  cars,  trains  and  ships.  By  doing  so,  we  can 
save  Americans  money  at  the  pump,  reduce  congestion  and  reduce  the  carbon  and 
other pollutants being emitted today. 

The CHAIRMAN. There is a vote pending at this moment. Senator 

Nelson will ask one question, and we will stand in recess. 

STATEMENT OF HON. BILL NELSON, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA 

Senator  NELSON.  We  have  7  minutes  left  to  vote,  so  you  all  are 
saying,  with  climate  change,  roads  will  buckle,  bridges  will  wash 
out, railroads will be destroyed. If the seas rose 2 feet, in my state 
of  Florida,  we’re  talking  about—what  kind  of  investment  in  trans-
portation would be thrown out the window as a result of that? 

Admiral  BARRETT.  I  would  guess—surmise,  substantial.  But,  I— 
again,  I  would  take  the  approach—the  Gulf  Coast,  trying  to  quan-
tify  specifically  where  those—what  rail  would  need  to  be  rerouted, 
what roads would need to be readjusted. I think you need very spe-
cific  analysis  at  a  local  and/or  regional  level.  And  obviously,  we’re 
working  toward  that.  Understanding  the  specific  impacts  is  enor-
mously important. 

Dr.  TURNER.  Sir,  one  of  the  things  that  I  would  add  is  that  one 
of our initiatives in our 2009 budget looks more broadly at making 
communities  more  disaster-resilient.  This  would  be  for  water, 
winds, fires, and so forth. 

Senator  NELSON.  And  that’s  the  point.  In  a  state  like  Florida, 
where 80 percent of the population is on the coast, it’s very difficult 
to  go  in  and  redo  all  of  that  infrastructure.  And  the  cost  is  just 
going  to  be  enormous.  So,  we’d  better  start  figuring  out  something 
to do so that the seas don’t rise. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
The  hearing  will  stand  in  recess.  We’ll  be  back  in  about  10  min-

utes. 

[Recess.] 
The CHAIRMAN. We shall resume the hearing. 
I’ve  been  asked  by  Senator  Thune  to  submit  his  remarks  and 

questions for the record. Without objection, it is so ordered.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA 
Thank  you  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Chairman  and  Vice  Chair-
man  for  holding  today’s  hearing  on  the  transportation  sector’s  impact  on  climate 
change and climate change’s impact on our transportation infrastructure. 

When  discussing  the  topic  of  transportation’s  impact  on  carbon  dioxide  and  other 
greenhouse  gas  emissions,  we  must  start  with  the  Energy  Independence  and  Secu-
rity Act of 2007. 

In  addition  to  the  historic  increase  in  vehicle  fuel  efficiency  standards  and  other 
energy efficiency programs, this bill included an expanded renewable fuels standard. 
The  2007  Energy  Bill  requires  the  use  of  36  billion  gallons  of  renewable  fuel  by 
2022.  The  new  RFS  also  includes  significant  requirements  for  lifecycle  greenhouse 
gas emission reductions. 

New  corn  ethanol  plants  must  produce  ethanol  with  a  20  percent  reduction  in 

lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. 

Advanced biofuel and cellulosic ethanol, which constitute the majority of the new 
RFS, must have a 50 percent reduction and 60 percent reduction in lifecycle green-
house gas emissions relative to regular gasoline. 

Mr.  Chairman,  this  landmark  piece  of  legislation  cannot  be  overlooked  when  dis-

cussing transportation sector’s impact on greenhouse gas emissions. 

Moving  forward,  we  must  continue  to  meet  the  challenges  of  high  fuel  costs  and 
greenhouse  gas  emissions  with  common  sense  policies  that  reduce  emissions  while 
keeping  U.S.  businesses  competitive,  our  economy  growing,  and  family  budgets  in-
tact. 

Climate Change’s impact on the transportation sector: 
On  account  of  aging  and  outdated  infrastructure,  we  have  economic  challenges 
that  are  real,  tangible,  and  identifiable  today.  Many  of  these  infrastructure  chal-
lenges are going unmet. 

Based  on  projections  of  population  growth  and  government  funding  streams  such 
as  the  Federal  Highway  trust,  fund  we  know  that  these  challenges  will  only  grow 
in  the  future  and  resources  will  increasingly  fall  short  of  meeting  these  real  short- 
and mid-term challenges. 

I  encourage  the  Committee  to  proceed  with  caution  when  considering  proposals 
that  allocate  scarce  Federal  resources  based  on  climate  models  or  projections  of 
weather patterns far into the future. 

The CHAIRMAN. May we have a 2-minute recess? 
[Recess.] 
The CHAIRMAN. You are here earlier than expected. 
Ms. Klobuchar? 

STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Well,  thank  you  so  much,  Mr.  Chairman. 

Thank you for waiting. And thank you, to our witnesses. 

Everywhere I went this weekend, this issue of the interaction be-
tween  changes  to  our  climate  and  our  transportation  system—con-
fronted me from our airlines executives at Northwest Airlines, who 
testified yesterday about the effect on the fuel and their need to do 
something  differently  there,  to  a  bus  line,  called  Jefferson  Bus 
Line,  that  I  did  an  event  with,  and  their  brochures  show  100  pen-
guins  getting  on  their  bus,  to  show  how,  by  using  public  transpor-
tation,  we  can  reduce  carbon  dioxide  emissions,  like,  55  cars  for 
every  bus,  to  a  very  sad  moment  when  we  went  to  look  at  the 
floods  in  southern  Minnesota,  right  on  the  Iowa  border,  and  went 
to  a  very  rural  part  of  our  state,  where  a  man  was  driving  a  busi-
ness owner to get a sump pump, in the middle of the night, to help 
his  daughter,  and  suddenly  the  road  just  opened  up  and  caved  in. 
It’s literally from this wall to that wall, a country road, down prob-
ably,  I  don’t  know,  10  yards,  and  he  died  in  this.  And  we  went  to 
the site with some of the rescue workers that tried to save his life.

But,  it  made  me  think—very  close  to  my  heart—about  the  effect 
that changes in our world are having on our transportation system. 
So, I know, Dr. Peterson, you talked about some of the work that 
might  need  to  be  done  for  bridges  and  for  roads  and  for  other 
things  if  we  continue  to  see  changes  to  our  climate  resulting  in 
more storms and tornados and everything else. Could you elaborate 
on that a little bit? 

Dr. PETERSON. Yes, thank you. 
One  of  the  things  we’re  realizing,  as  the  climate  is  changing,  is 
that  it  is  not  only  changing  now,  or  has  changed  in  the  past,  but 
that it will change even more rapidly into the future, and we need 
to  take  this  into  consideration  as  we’re  designing  infrastructure. 
Some of the questions about infrastructure are a result of how long 
it  has  been  in  service.  For  example,  some  coastal  railroad  tracks 
were laid shortly after the Civil War, and the climate has changed. 
Sea  level  has  risen  since  then,  and  is  expected  to  continue  to  rise 
in the future. So, we need to have a continuing effort to take adap-
tation  measures.  Not  only  at  the  present  time,  but  continuing  into 
the  future.  To  always  try  to  include  the  latest  information  as  we 
design  structures  to  withstand  the  future  climate  as  it  is  evolving 
and going on. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  And,  of  course,  we,  here  in  Congress,  have 
a  responsibility  to  try  to  figure  out  how  to  fund  it,  and  right  now 
we are looking at a potentially bankrupt Highway Trust Fund if we 
don’t  do  something  different  there.  And  I  don’t  expect  you  to  give 
us that answer, but it’s clearly, as I hear about the adaptations you 
think that we need, that we’re going to have to look at more infra-
structure funding. 

Have you looked, also, at the effect on the Great Lakes? Because, 
with  the  exception  of  this  year,  over  the  past  80  years  we’ve  seen 
Lake  Superior  at  its  lowest  level—it’s  still  low  now,  it  was  just 
lower the year before—due to climate change, because the water is 
evaporating.  It’s  different  than  the  sea.  The  ice  melts  quicker,  the 
water  evaporates,  and  the  water  levels  are  going  down,  so  we’re 
having severe problems with barge traffic coming in. 

Dr. PETERSON. Yes, as the ice recedes and there is less ice, there 
is  more  evaporation  with  a  general  trend  towards  more  drying  in 
the midsection of the continent. We were just working on a figure, 
last week, of Great Lakes water levels with different model projec-
tions  into  the  future,  going  out  to  2100,  and  all  of  the  Great  Lake 
levels  were  projected  to  decrease  under  all  the  different  global 
warming scenarios we were looking at. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. OK. Thank you. I just wondered if that was 

unique to our lake. 

And  then,  I  wanted  to  turn  to—Mr.  Deputy  Secretary,  to  some 
of  the  issues  of  the  biofuels,  which  both  you  and  Dr.  Turner  men-
tioned.  And  we  are  one  of  the  leading  states  for  biodiesel,  were 
ahead  of  our  time  on  ethanol,  and  are  now  ahead  of  our  time,  in 
terms  of  looking  to  that  next  stage  of  ethanol,  which  is  cellulosic, 
with  prairie  grass  and—I’ve  seen  plants  in  my  state.  Guys  have 
laptop  computers  showing  how  we  can  grow  it  on  all  the  highway 
medians.  And  my  husband  and  I  wonder  how  we’re  going  to  har-
vest  it.  It  looks  a  little  dangerous.  But,  the  point  is  that  there  are 
all  kinds  of  possibilities  to  go  into  this  next  stage  of  ethanol,  and 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:04 Feb 13, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\78852.TXT JACKIE

38 

I  just  wondered  what  you  see  as  the  potential  of  biofuels  if  we  go 
beyond where we are now with corn? 

Admiral  BARRETT.  Senator,  thanks.  Obviously,  alternative  and 
renewable  fuels  are  something  that  offers  some  possibilities.  What 
we are looking at is both the research and technology necessary to 
allow  these  fuels  to  operate  safely.  Safety  is  always  our  primary 
concern. And, as you bring ethanol, alcohol-based fuels, into trans-
portation  networks,  the  ability  to  move  them  and  distribute  them 
safely  is  a  concern.  So,  we’re  investing  a  fair  amount  of  research 
in that, and obviously working with a lot of partners. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  And  I  probably  missed  the  main  point.  I 
mean,  the  main  point,  when  we’re  talking  about  climate  change 
and  the  interaction  with  transportation,  is,  not  only  is  it  energy- 
independent,  but  it’s  actually  the—if  done  right,  the  prairie  grass, 
the  cellulosic  is  actually  carbon-negative,  as  opposed  to  the  corn, 
which  reduces  carbon  dioxide  by,  I  think,  20  percent  over  the  fuel, 
but  this  could  actually  be  carbon-negative,  so  it  could  reduce—— 
Admiral  BARRETT.  And  I—in  broad  terms,  we  obviously  have  to 
make  our  vehicles  more  efficient,  we  have  to  make  our  systems 
more  efficient,  we  have  to  look  for  alternative  and  renewable 
sources, we have to improve our supplies. I think it’s multifaceted. 
I also think it will take time. The market will help determine how 
quickly  it  can  be  brought  forward  and  how  it  works  for  American 
consumers and their vehicles. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  And,  Dr.  Turner,  one  of  the  things  we’re 
looking at is some higher blends. Let’s say, we—you know, we have 
E85  in  Minnesota,  but  we  also—E10,  E20,  but  we  could  do  some 
higher  blend  of  fuel,  where  it’s  part  gas  and  then  it’s  part  biofuel, 
whether  it’s  from  algae  or  whatever  we’re  going  to  develop  in  this 
country.  Have  you  looked  at  that  for  standards  for  certification?  I 
know  there’s  also—it’s—being  in  a  big  snowmobiling  state  of  Min-
nesota,  there  are  also  some  issues  for  smaller  engines  with  higher 
biofuel  blends  that  we’re  going  to  have  to  look  at  and  make  sure 
that they’re still going to be able to work. But, could you talk about 
that?  Because  that  could  be  a  very  promising  development,  if  we 
actually  up  the  percentage  of  biofuels  in  all  of  our—in  all  of  our 
fuel. 

Dr.  TURNER.  Yes,  Senator.  As  you’re  aware,  measurements  and 
standards are our core competency, and we certainly are looking at 
that. We’re also looking a bit beyond that, to look at different cata-
lysts  that  may  be  available  to  make  the  process  of  producing  the 
ethanol  more  efficient.  Also,  we  are  looking  at  the  possibility  of 
synthetic molecules that would have a greater energy content than 
the ethanol that’s currently produced. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Exactly. 
Dr. TURNER. We’re looking at things, across the board, as well as 
looking  globally  at  the  other  countries  that  will  be  playing  in  the 
ethanol  economy,  to  make  sure  that  we  have  a  level  playing  field 
and we have common terminology and common definitions and are 
able  to  trace  back  to  common  standard  references  for  precisely 
what is ethanol, so that our consumers can have confidence that for 
each dollar they pay, they get what they think they’re getting. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  And  I  just  think  sometimes  this—biofuel 
things  get  very  confusing  for  people,  but  it’s  an  infant  industry, 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:04 Feb 13, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\78852.TXT JACKIE

39 

and  it  clearly  needs  to  get  more  efficient  as  we  go  forward.  But, 
when we look at other countries, like Brazil, they’ve done a lot with 
this, and it’s possible, if we do this right, we can actually do some-
thing about climate change at the same time. 

So, thank you, to all three of you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.

STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Mr.  Chairman,  I’ll  wait  until  the  second 

panel comes, please. 

The CHAIRMAN. OK. 
Then,  I’d  like  to  thank  Admiral  Barrett,  Acting  Director  Turner, 
and Senior Scientist Peterson. We thank you very much. Your tes-
timony will be most helpful. 

And we’ll be submitting many questions. We look forward to your 

answers. 

Our next panel consists of the Chair of the American Association 
of  State  Highway  and  Transportation  Officials,  Climate  Change 
Technical Assistance Program, and the Secretary of Transportation 
of  the  State  of  Maryland,  the  Honorable  John  D.  Porcari;  then  the 
Affiliate Professor of Economics, Loyola College in Maryland, on be-
half of the National Research Council, Three Stratford Road, Balti-
more, Dr. G. Edward Dickey; Research Director of the Clean Vehi-
cles Program, Union of Concerned Scientists, Mr. David Friedman; 
President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  American—Association  of 
American Railroads, Mr. Edward Hamberger; Executive Vice Presi-
dent  and  Chief  Operating  Officer,  Air  Transport  Association,  Mr. 
John  M.  Meenan;  and  the  Chairman  of  the  Arctic  Research  Com-
mission, Mr. Mead Treadwell, of Anchorage. 

I’d  like  to  recognize  Mr.  Lautenberg  for  his  opening  statement. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I apologize 

for my late arrival. 

I saw a phenomenon this morning that is almost noteworthy; and 
that was, I came down on an airplane that was on time. It is very 
unusual. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Mr.  Chairman,  one-third  of  America’s 
greenhouse gas emissions comes from cars, trucks, and buses. And 
Dr.  James  Hansen,  NASA  scientist,  said,  just  last  week,  and  I 
quote, ‘‘If we don’t begin to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the 
next several years, then we are in trouble.’’ And we’ve got to begin 
by getting cars off the road, more people onto passenger rail, buses, 
subways, and other types of mass transit. Already, more and more 
people  are  riding  public  transit,  and  it’s  more  efficient,  more  con-
venient, and, with these high gas prices, certainly more affordable. 
Now, as all know, gas has skyrocketed in price from $1.50 a gal-
lon  in  2000  to  more  than  $4.00  a  gallon  today.  And  that’s  why,  in 
the  first  3  months  of  this  year,  the  number  of  people  taking  mass- 
transit options rose more than 3 percent, just in the first 3 months, 
over  the  same  period  last  year.  And  I’m  a  user  of  trains  on  a  reg-
ular  basis,  and  it’s  just  more  and  more  crowded,  people  jamming 
the cars and the stations.

Amtrak also set records last month, both in number of riders and 
amount of revenue. And the Lautenberg-Lott Amtrak bill, which we 
hope  to  finalize  soon,  and  send  to  the  President  for  his  signature, 
will  lead  to  even  more  rail  options  for  travelers.  But,  for  travelers 
who  still  need  or  choose  to  drive,  we  must  continue  improving  the 
fuel economy of our cars and trucks. 

Last  year,  we  took  the  historic  step  of  increasing  the  fuel  effi-
ciency  of  our  vehicles  for  the  first  time  in  decades.  But,  that  same 
day,  the  Bush  EPA  denied  a  waiver  to  allow  California,  New  Jer-
sey,  and  14  other  states  to  set  fuel  economy  at  even  the  higher 
standard  of  40  miles  a  gallon  by  2020.  Now,  if  this  waiver  were 
granted,  it  would  take  the  equivalent  of  more  than  6  million  cars 
and  trucks  off  the  road.  Congress  must  act  to  overturn  the  Presi-
dent’s action. 

We’ve  also  got  to  act  to  ensure  more  efficient  movement  of 
freight.  Trains  are  at  least  six  times  more  energy  efficient  than 
trucks,  and  barges  are  more  than  eight  times  more  efficient.  I 
chaired  a  Subcommittee  hearing  a  couple  of  weeks  ago  on  freight 
transportation needs, and, based on what I learned, I plan to intro-
duce tax relief legislation which will encourage greater use of ships 
and barges, or, as we call it, short sea shipping between U.S. ports. 
By  investing  in  fuel  efficiency,  mass  transit,  and  better  freight 
strategies,  we  can  both  bring  relief  to  the  people  at  the  pump  and 
fight global warming for generations to come. 

And  I  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  permitting  me  to  go  out  of 

order. 

The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Lautenberg, will you yield? 
I regret I must leave this hearing. And so, I will be relinquishing 

the chair to Senator Lautenberg. 

And  I  thank  you  very  much,  members  of  the  panel.  But,  I  have 

two other meetings to attend. So, thank you. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG [presiding].  Thank  you,  Mr.  Ex-Chairman. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator LAUTENBERG. I don’t do this lightly. 
We welcome the panel, and I’m pleased to be here with my friend 
Senator Stevens from Alaska. You heard the Chairman bring in the 
list of our panel, and I’m pleased to have you all here. And I would

TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS 

Mr.  PORCARI.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  members  of  the

of  State  Highway  and  Transportation  Officials  in  my  capacity  as 
Chair of the Climate Change Technical Assistance Advisory Board. 
And let me say that, first, the State DOTs are working to be part 
of  the  climate  change  solution.  As  you  have  noted,  transportation 
represents  approximately  one-third  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions, 
and  it’s  estimated  that  highway  vehicles  generate  72  percent  of 
those emissions. 

To  make  a  positive  contribution  to  the  issue  of  global  climate 
change,  AASHTO  believes  transportation  policies  need  to  reduce 
dependence  on  foreign  oil,  reduce  energy  consumption,  and  reduce 
travel  demand  relative  to  current  trends.  To  achieve  these  goals, 
AASHTO  has  called  for  reducing  oil  consumption  by  20  percent  in 
10  years,  doubling  the  fuel  efficiency  of  new  passenger  cars  and 
light trucks by 2020, in the fleet by 2030, and reducing the growth 
of  vehicle-miles-traveled  from  the  predicted  2  percent  per  year  to 
1 percent per year. 

To reduce vehicle travel, AASHTO has endorsed doubling transit 
ridership by 2030, significantly expanding the market share of pas-
sengers and freight moved by rail rather than trucks, reducing the 
percentage  of  commuters  who  drive  alone  to  the  1980  levels,  and 
increasing  the  percentage  of  those  who  ride  transit,  carpool,  walk, 
bike, and work at home. 

Additionally,  we’re  utilizing  a  publication  we  call  the  ‘‘AASHTO 
Transportation  and  Climate  Change  Primer’’  to  outline,  for  State 
and  industry  transportation  leaders,  the  current  thinking  on  cli-
mate change and transportation. 

We have also initiated a climate change technical assistance pro-
gram  to  supply  states  with  timely  information,  tools,  technical  as-
sistance, and assistance in meeting climate change challenges. 

Let  me  briefly  turn  to  the  points  that  we  believe  should  guide 

Federal policy in this area. 

First,  the  challenge  before  us  is  to  reduce  total  greenhouse  gas 
emissions  worldwide.  We  need  to  develop  national  policies  that  re-
duce  our  own  emissions,  and,  where  possible,  contribute  to  the 
broader global effort to reduce emissions. 

Second,  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  worldwide  will  re-
quire  a  major  contribution  from  every  country  and  every  economic 
sector,  including  transportation.  No  one  can  sit  on  the  sidelines. 
Transportation agencies stand ready to do our part. 

Third, reducing greenhouse gas emissions will involve many sep-
arate  initiatives.  In  the  transportation  sector,  we  need  improve-
ments  in  fuel  economy,  greater  usage  of  low-carbon  fuels,  better 
management of our transportation system to reduce congestion and 
smooth  traffic  flows,  and  we  need  to  take  steps  that  reduce  the 
growth in vehicle miles traveled. 

Fourth, we should focus on finding solutions that yield the great-
est emissions reductions at the lowest cost. In other words, cost-ef-
fectiveness should be a major consideration in setting policy. 

Fifth  and  finally,  we  need  major  technological  breakthroughs  in 
order  to  have  any  chance  of  dramatically  cutting  global  emissions 
of  greenhouse  gases.  For  transportation,  this  means  improvement 
of  fuel  economy,  but  ultimately  a  transition  to  entirely  new  fuels 
and new propulsion systems.

With  these  breakthroughs  and  significant  reductions,  we  believe 

we can still allow for the travel growth to support the economy. 

In  recent  decades,  road  travel  has  greatly  increased,  while  the 
emissions  of  many  harmful  air  pollutants  have  been  significantly 
reduced. Technological innovation has made this possible. Reducing 
greenhouse  gas  emissions  presents  a  new  challenge,  and  techno-
logical advances will be just as important. 

We’re  also  seeing  a  tempering  of  growth  in  travel,  due,  in  part, 
to the higher fuel prices. Rather than growing at 2 percent or more 
annually,  we’ve  seeing  the  average  vehicle-mile-traveled  growth  of 
one-half of 1 percent since 2004. 

Recently, USDOT reported the cumulative vehicle miles of travel 
for  2008  declined  by  2.1  percent.  It’s  feasible,  through  a  combina-
tion  of  measures,  to  achieve  major  reductions  in  greenhouse  gases 
from  road  travel  in  the  U.S.  Relieving  traffic  congestion  is  also  es-
sential  to  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  optimal  speed 
for  motor  vehicles  is  about  45  miles  per  hour.  At  lower  speeds, 
emissions  are  several  times  higher.  If  we  can  reduce  the  fuel 
burned  by  vehicles  stalled  in  traffic,  that  is  a  gain.  If  we  can  im-
prove  the  flow  of  traffic  so  fuel  is  burned  at  a  more  optimal  effi-
ciency, that will also produce a gain. 

In  my  own  State  of  Maryland,  under  the  leadership  of  Governor 
Martin O’Malley, we’ve developed a statewide greenhouse gas emis-
sions and carbon footprint reduction strategy. Our goal is to reduce 
emissions  between  25  and  50  percent  by  2020,  and  to  obtain  a  90- 
percent  reduction  in  greenhouse  gases  by  2050.  Those  transpor-
tation  policies  that  will  help  implement  this  include:  slowing  the 
growth  of  VMT,  supporting  the  development  and  use  of  improved 
techniques  and  fuels,  and  examining  other  strategies,  such  as  pro-
moting sustainable transit communities and transit-oriented devel-
opment. 

We’re also evaluating what climate change and sea level rise will 
mean  to  our  transportation  infrastructure,  given  that  Maryland 
has  4,360  miles  of  shoreline.  Now,  fortunately,  as  a  multimodal 
State  DOT  with  one  transportation  trust  fund  for  highways,  tran-
sit, ports, and airports, we can work across the board to meet these 
goals. 

Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN PORCARI,  SECRETARY,  MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF 
TRANSPORTATION;  CHAIR,  CLIMATE CHANGE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
ADVISORY BOARD;  AND CHAIR,  STANDING COMMITTEE ON AVIATION,  AMERICAN 
ASSOCIATION OF STATE HIGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS 
Good  morning,  I  am  John  Porcari,  Secretary  of  the  Maryland  Department  of 
Transportation.  Thank  you  for  the  invitation  to  speak  today  on  an  issue  of  critical 
importance  to  the  Nation—climate  change  and  national  strategies  to  address  cli-
mate change. 

I  am  appearing  on  behalf  of  the  American  Association  of  State  Highway  and 
Transportation  Officials  (AASHTO).  I  chair  AASHTO’s  Climate  Change  Technical 
Assistance Program Advisory Board and the Standing Committee on Aviation. I will 
also touch on some Maryland activities and initiatives. 

AASHTO and its members are working diligently to be part of the climate change 
solution. AASHTO has undertaken a number of climate change activities, including: 
• Organizing  a  Transportation  Vision  Conference  in  Spring,  2007  which  included 

discussions regarding sustainability and climate change; 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:04 Feb 13, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\78852.TXT JACKIE

• Publishing, in April 2008, a Primer on Transportation and Climate Change; and 
• Developing a Climate Change Technical Assistance Program to supply AASHTO 
members with timely information, tools and technical assistance to assist them 
in meeting the difficult challenges that arise related to climate change. 

These  and  other  materials  will  be  provided  to  the  Committee  staff  for  use  by  the 

Committee. 

In  May,  2007  AASHTO  brought  together  transportation  experts  from  across  the 
nation,  representing  users,  builders  and  providers  of  our  transportation  system  for 
a three-day Transportation Vision and Strategies for the 21st Century Summit. The 
resulting  report,  A  New  Vision  for  the  21st  Century,  recognized  the  difficult  chal-
lenge  of  expanding  the  transportation  network’s  capacity  to  serve  a  growing  popu-
lation  and  communities  and  an  expanding  economy  while  simultaneously  reducing 
the  environmental  footprint  of  the  system.  To  address  this  challenge,  AASHTO 
adopted  the  ‘‘Triple  Bottom  Line’’  approach,  to  encourage  sustainable  development 
by  evaluating  performance  on  the  basis  of  social,  economic  and  environmental  im-
pacts. The ‘‘triple bottom line’’ calls for: 

• Robust economic growth, 
• ‘‘Better than before’’ health of the environment, and 
• Improved quality of life for all citizens. 
AASHTO  further  recognized  that  to  make  a  positive  contribution  to  the  issue  of 
global climate change, transportation policies need to reduce dependence on foreign 
oil,  reduce  energy  consumption,  and  reduce  travel  demand,  relative  to  current 
trends. To achieve these goals AASHTO called for: 

• Supporting  the  President’s  goal  to  reduce  oil  consumption  by  20  percent  in  10 

• Doubling the fuel efficiency of new passenger cars and light trucks by 2020, the 

• Reducing  the  growth  of  vehicle  miles  traveled  from  the  predicted  2  percent  per 

years, 

entire fleet by 2030, and 

year to 1 percent per year. 

To achieve the proposed reduction in VMT growth, AASHTO proposed: 
• Doubling transit ridership by 2030, 
• Significantly  expanding  the  market  share  of  passengers  and  freight  moved  by 

rail rather than trucks, 

• Reducing the percentage of commuters who drive alone to 1980 levels, and 
• Increasing  the  percentage  of  those  who  ride  transit,  carpool,  walk,  bike  and 

work at home. 

The  AASHTO  Transportation  and  Climate  Change  Primer  was  developed  to  pro-
vide AASHTO members with an introduction to the issue of climate change and its 
implications  for  transportation  policy  in  the  United  States.  The  paper  is  organized 
into five parts: 

• Part I summarizes the current state of scientific knowledge concerning the causes 

and impacts of climate change. 

• Part II provides an introduction to climate change policy issues. 
• Part  III  discusses  trends  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  road  transportation. 
• Part  IV  reviews  potential  measures  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from 

road transportation. 

• Part V identifies issues for further study. 
The  Primer  is  based  on  the  most  recent  research  in  the  field.  Its  purpose  is  to 
outline  for  AASHTO  members  the  current  thinking  of  governmental  agencies,  re-
searchers,  and  advocacy  groups  on  the  issue  of  climate  change  and  transportation. 
General Observations 

In  my  testimony  today,  I  will  focus  on  the  issue  of  climate  change  as  it  relates 
to  the  surface  transportation  system,  specifically  highways.  I  will  begin  with  a  few 
general points that we believe should guide Federal policy in this area. 

First: The challenge before us is to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions, world-
wide. In the end, it is the global total that matters. This means we need to develop 
national  policies  that  reduce  our  own  emissions  and,  where  possible,  contribute  to 
the broader global effort to reduce emissions.

Second:  Reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  worldwide  will  require  a  major  con-
tribution  from  every  country  and  every  economic  sector,  including  transportation. 
No one can sit on the sidelines and wait for others to carry the burden. As transpor-
tation agencies, we stand ready to do our part. 

Third:  The  effort  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  will  involve  many  separate 
initiatives.  There  is  no  silver  bullet.  We  should  not  get  so  caught  up  in  debates 
about  competing  approaches  that  we  lose  sight  of  this  bigger  picture.  In  the  trans-
portation sector, this means we need improvements in fuel economy; we need great-
er usage of low-carbon fuels; we need better management of our transportation sys-
tem  to  reduce  congestion  and  smooth  traffic  flows;  and  we  need  to  take  steps  that 
reduce the growth in vehicle miles traveled (VMT). 

Fourth:  We  should  focus  on  finding  solutions  that  yield  the  greatest  emission  re-
ductions  at  the  least  cost.  In  other  words,  cost-effectiveness  should  be  a  major  con-
sideration  in  setting  policy.  Congress  will  be  asked  to  consider  many  proposals  in 
the  name  of  climate  change.  The  question  that  must  be  asked  is:  How  much  emis-
sions reduction will this policy deliver, and at what cost? 

Fifth,  and  finally:  Technological  innovation  has  been  the  key  to  environmental 
progress  in  many  areas.  That  will  be  even  truer  with  greenhouse  gas  emissions. 
Quite  simply,  we  need  major  technological  breakthroughs  in  order  to  have  any 
chance  of  dramatically  cutting  global  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases.  For  transpor-
tation,  this  means  not  only  improvement  in  fuel  economy,  but  ultimately  a  transi-
tion to entirely new fuels and new propulsion systems—for example, plug-in hybrid 
vehicles,  zero-emission  fuel-cell  vehicles,  and  large-scale  use  of  next-generation  re-
newable fuels such as cellulosic ethanol. 
Trends in Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Road Travel 

According  to  the  policy  analysis  seen  to  date,  transportation  represents  approxi-
mately one third of greenhouse gas emissions, and it is estimated that highway ve-
hicles generate 72 percent of those emissions. 

Between  now  and  2030,  the  U.S.  Government  forecasts  that  fuel  efficiency  will 
continue  to  improve  and  renewable  fuels  will  gain  market  share,  but  also  vehicle 
miles traveled (VMT) will continue to grow at 1.6 to 1.9 percent annually, outpacing 
the  gains  in  fuel  efficiency.  The  result  is  that,  according  to  DOE’s  forecasts,  green-
house gas emissions from the transportation sector are projected to increase gradu-
ally between now and 2030. 

Clearly, it is important to find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the 
U.S.  transportation  system,  but  how?  It  is  a  difficult  challenge,  but  the  challenge 
can  be  overcome.  Recently,  AASHTO  published  a  report—the  ‘‘Primer  on  Transpor-
tation and Climate Change—which analyzed this issue. 

The Primer developed four scenarios showing how much greenhouse gas emissions 
could  be  reduced  under  a  range  of  assumptions  about  fuel  economy  and  growth  in 
vehicle  miles  traveled.  These  scenarios  assumed  that  fuel  economy  would  increase 
faster  than  currently  forecasted  by  USDOE—increasing  to  50  or  100  miles  per  gal-
lon  in  2050.  (For  this  study,  ‘‘miles  per  gallon’’  was  measured  in  ‘‘gasoline  equiva-
lent’’,  which  is  a  measure  that  converts  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  electric  or 
hydrogen  fuel-cell  vehicles  into  an  equivalent  amount  of  gasoline  usage).  The  sce-
narios considered in the primer also assumed the VMT would grow at either 1.5 per-
cent  or  1.0  percent  annually,  which  would  be  slower  than  the  USDOE’s  forecasts. 
AASHTO  found  that  under  these  scenarios,  major  reductions  in  greenhouse  gas 
emissions  are  achievable—in  the  range  of  60  to  80  percent  under  the  more  opti-
mistic scenarios. 

These  scenarios  are  intended  to  illustrate  the  point  that  significant  reductions  in 
greenhouse gas emissions from road travel can be achieved, if we have major break-
throughs  in  fuel  economy  and  a  slight  tempering  of  travel  demand  growth—while 
still  allowing  for  travel  demand  to  increase  at  a  rate  at  least  equal  to  population 
growth. 

So  is  it  realistic  to  achieve  these  dramatic  reductions  in  greenhouse  gas  emis-

sions? 

First, in terms of fuel economy: We have all seen the tremendous increase in sales 
of  gas-electric  hybrid  vehicles,  which  were  rare  up  until  just  a  few  years  ago.  The 
auto  manufacturers  are  working  on  developing  entirely  new  vehicles,  such  as  plug- 
in hybrids—for example, the Chevy Volt—that runs entirely on electricity. Research-
ers are also working on other innovations in vehicles and fuels, including next-gen-
eration  (cellulosic)  ethanol  and  hydrogen  fuel-cell  vehicles.  The  seeds  of  tomorrow’s 
technological breakthroughs have already been planted. 

And in terms of vehicle miles traveled: The VMT growth trends have been taper-
ing off in recent years. Rather than growing at 2 percent or more annually, we have 
seen average VMT growth rates of approximately 0.5 percent (one-half of a percent)

since  2004.  And  very  recently,  the  USDOT  reported  that  cumulative  vehicle  miles 
traveled for 2008 declined by 2.1 percent. Higher gasoline prices have played a role 
in  this  shift,  as  have  demographic  factors.  But  the  bottom  line  is  this:  we  are  not 
seeing  runaway  growth  in  VMT;  in  fact,  we  are  seeing  just  the  opposite.  The  tem-
pering  of  VMT  growth  provides  another  indication  that  it  is  feasible—through  a 
combination  of  measures—to  achieve  major  reductions  in  greenhouse  gases  from 
road travel in the U.S. 
Reducing  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions  Through  Innovation  in  Vehicles  and 

Fuels 

In recent decades, the volume of road travel has greatly increased, while the emis-
sions of many harmful air pollutants have been significantly reduced. Technological 
innovation  has  made  this  progress  possible:  today’s  vehicles  are  more  fuel-efficient 
and employ far more sophisticated emissions-control technologies than those on the 
roads  in  the  1970s.  Reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  presents  a  new  challenge, 
and  in  some  ways  a  greater  one.  But  technological  advances  will  be  just  as  impor-
tant  to  meeting  this  challenge  as  they  have  been  to  achieving  environmental  goals 
in the past. 

As  the  AASHTO  scenarios  illustrate,  technological  innovation  is  essential  to 
achieving  emissions  reductions.  There  are  several  ways  that  Congress  can  help  en-
courage innovation in vehicles and fuels. I will briefly cover several of the most im-
portant ways that Congress can assist in this area. 
Strengthening Vehicle Emission Standards 

In  2007,  Congress  increased  the  CAFE  standard  for  passenger  vehicles  and  light 
trucks  to  35  mpg,  which  must  be  achieved  by  2020.  The  law  also  creates  a  frame-
work  under  which  CAFE  standards  may  further  increase  between  2021  and  2030 
for  passenger  cars  and  light  trucks,  and  establishes  a  program  under  which  fuel- 
economy standards will be set for medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks. There could 
also be separate legislative or regulatory initiatives to continue raising fuel-economy 
standards,  as  a  way  of  making  continued  progress  toward  reducing  greenhouse  gas 
emissions despite increasing travel demand. 

In addition, California and several other states have adopted stricter vehicle emis-
sion  standards  than  those  established  by  the  Federal  Government.  However,  these 
standards  cannot  take  effect  unless  a  waiver  is  granted  by  EPA,  and  in  December 
2007,  EPA  denied  the  waiver.  California  and  other  states  have  filed  a  lawsuit  to 
overturn  the  waiver,  and  that  case  is  now  pending.  If  the  California  standards  are 
eventually  allowed  to  proceed,  or  are  adopted  in  some  form  at  the  Federal  level, 
they will contribute to further reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. 

Researchers  have  suggested  another  regulatory  option,  which  focuses  specifically 
on greenhouse gas emissions. This concept involves setting greenhouse gas emission 
standards for vehicles—that is, a standard for the grams of greenhouse gases emit-
ted per mile of travel. This type of standard would more precisely reflect the under-
lying  goal  of  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  not  just  reducing  the  amount  of 
fuel consumed. This standard could be defined so that it covers all greenhouse gases 
emitted by vehicles, including methane and nitrous dioxide, not just CO2. 
Low-Carbon Fuel Standards 

Federal  legislation  has  set  goals  for  the  total  amount  of  biofuels  to  be  produced 
in 2022 (36 billion gallons), but has not set an overall goal or requirement for reduc-
ing  the  carbon  content  of  transportation  fuels.  However,  California  has  adopted  a 
low-carbon fuel standard, which calls for a 10 percent reduction in the carbon inten-
sity of transportation fuels by 2020. Additional states, and possibly the Federal Gov-
ernment, could adopt low-carbon fuel standards in the future. If such standards are 
adopted, it will be important to consider the life-cycle emissions of greenhouse gases 
associated with each fuel. Some of the benefits of using low-carbon fuels may be off-
set  by  the  additional  greenhouse  gas  emissions  that  result  from  clearing  land  and 
growing crops to produce the fuels. 
Cap-and-Trade Program/Carbon Tax 

Any  system  for  pricing  carbon  (whether  it  involves  a  cap-and-trade  program  or  a 
carbon tax) could include transportation fuels. For the consumer, the increased cost 
of carbon would show up in the price of gasoline at the pump. Estimates differ about 
how  much  a  system  of  carbon  pricing  would  affect  gasoline  prices.  However,  there 
is  general  agreement  that  the  effect  on  gasoline  prices  would  be  noticeable  but  not 
dramatic in relation to the price increases that have occurred in recent years. 

The  enormity  of  the  potential  revenues  from  a  carbon  tax  or  cap-and-trade  pro-
gram  would  give  rise  to  important  policy  decisions  about  how  to  spend  those  reve-
nues  and  whether  to  make  offsetting  tax  cuts.  Certainly,  there  would  be  a  strong

46 

policy  preference  for  funding  activities  that  help  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions, such as increased investments in transit, better management of our transpor-
tation  system  to  reduce  congestion  and  smooth  traffic  flows,  and  removing  barriers 
to  high  density  development.  Congress  should  also  consider  dedicating  a  portion  of 
the  revenues  from  such  a  program  to  help  meet  the  costs  of  adapting  to  climate 
change,  including  the  costs  of  adapting  the  Nation’s  transportation  infrastructure. 
Reducing  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions  by  Reducing  the  Growth  in  Vehicle 

Miles Traveled (VMT) 

While  technological  change  is  essential  to  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions, 
there  is  also  a  role  for  strategies  that  help  to  limit  the  growth  in  travel  demand. 
As  discussed  above,  the  total  VMT  has  grown  much  faster  than  population  growth 
for  the  past  several  decades,  but  appears  to  have  slowed  considerably  in  the  past 
few  years.  The  average  annual  increase  in  VMT  between  1990  and  2005  was  ap-
proximately  2.2  percent.  By  contrast,  population  increased  only  about  0.8  percent 
per  year  during  this  period.  Between  2005  and  2007,  VMT  growth  occurred  at  a 
much slower rate—approximately 0.5 percent annually. Recent reports indicate that 
over  the  12  month  period  between  March  2007  and  March  2008,  VMT  declined  by 
4.3 percent 

This  recent  data  suggests  that  the  VMT  growth  rates  are  moderating.  It  is  un-
clear  at  this  point  whether  the  lower  growth  rates  are  merely  a  temporary  depar-
ture  from  historical  trends  or  a  sign  that  future  VMT  growth  will  be  much  lower 
than in the past. Certainly, it is plausible that continued record high oil prices will 
cause motor fuel prices to remain high or increase, which could continue to dampen 
growth  in  VMT.  In  addition,  changing  demographics  (an  increase  in  retirees  as  the 
baby  boomer  generation  reaches  65  years  of  age)  could  also  help  to  reduce  the  rate 
of  VMT  growth,  since  people  over  the  age  of  65  generally  drive  less  than  the  rest 
of the population. 

There are many factors that can affect the future growth rate of VMT. Among the 
most  important  factors  are  economic  trends  and  demographic  forces,  which  are 
largely beyond the influence of government policies. For example, a strong economy 
and rising average incomes tend to produce increases in VMT; conversely, large and 
sustained increases in fuel prices will tend to dampen the growth in VMT. 

Against  the  backdrop  of  these  larger  trends,  government  policies  also  can  play  a 
role—albeit  a  limited  one—in  influencing  VMT  growth.  Strategies  that  can  be  used 
include:  (1)  increasing  investments  in  transit  and  intercity  passenger  rail,  (2)  ex-
panding  other  alternatives  to  single-occupant  vehicle  travel,  and  (3)  encouraging 
land uses that minimize the number and length of auto trips. 
Expanding Transit Service and Intercity Passenger Rail 

Transit  service  provides  an  alternative  to  automobile  travel  and,  under  certain 
conditions, can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The challenge is how to make 
the most of transit’s potential, given that it serves a relatively small share of travel 
in  the  United  States  (1  percent  of  passenger  miles  traveled)  and  major  transit  sys-
tem expansions require significant public sector funding. Additional research will be 
required  to  determine  how  much  of  a  reduction  in  total  greenhouse  gas  emissions 
could be achieved through increased transit ridership and which types of transit in-
vestments  would  yield  the  greatest  (and  most  cost-effective)  reductions  in  green-
house gas emissions. 

While expanding transit service may not yield major reductions in greenhouse gas 
emissions,  there  are  still  good  policy  justifications  for  increasing  investments  in 
transit  service.  For  example,  transit  service  continues  to  play  a  key  role  in  main-
taining  mobility  within  large  and  densely  population  metropolitan  areas,  especially 
for  populations  that  lack  access  to  an  automobile.  In  addition,  expanding  transit 
service  can  facilitate  higher-density  land  use  patterns  that  help  to  reduce  the  need 
for  auto  trips.  These  considerations,  in  combination  with  the  potential  greenhouse 
gas  emission  reduction  benefits,  provide  support  for  continuing  to  expand  transit 
service as an integral part of the transportation system. 
Expanding Alternatives to Single-Occupant Auto Travel 

In addition to transit, passenger travel also occurs by walking, biking, carpooling, 
vanpooling,  and  telecommuting.  To  the  extent  that  auto  driving  in  single-occupant 
vehicles  can  be  shifted  to  these  alternatives,  greenhouse  gas  reductions  can  be 
achieved. Telecommuting is likely to be a highly cost-effective strategy for reducing 
greenhouse  gas  emissions,  as  telecommuting  costs  are  quite  low,  with  potentially  a 
net savings per ton of greenhouse gas reduction, after factoring in reduced auto op-
erating costs.

Changes in Land Use Patterns 

47 

Land  use  decisions  play  an  important  role  in  determining  the  demand  for  auto-
mobile  travel.  Existing  land  use  patterns  in  many  areas  make  automobile  travel  a 
necessity for most trips. Higher-density land use patterns, combined with increased 
availability of transit service, could help to reduce the demand for automobile travel 
without reducing mobility. 

A  key  question  is  how  to  bring  about  those  types  of  changes  in  land  use,  which 
can be difficult because land use decisions are primarily made by local governments. 
Government  efforts  should  be  focused  on  removing  the  barriers  to  higher-density 
land  use  patterns,  not  regulating  lifestyle  changes.  Example  of  such  barriers  in-
clude, local land use policies, such as zoning and parking regulations and local reli-
ance on land use taxes which tend to make localities favor commercial development 
rather  than  residential  development.  In  addition,  efforts  should  be  made  to  tie  the 
location  employment  centers  with  affordable  housing  and  tie  high  density  develop-
ment with transit services. 

As  with  transit,  an  important  question  to  consider  is  how  much  greenhouse  gas 
emissions  reduction  can  be  achieved  by  shifting  to  higher-density  and  less  auto-de-
pendent  land  use  patterns.  This  issue—the  magnitude  of  the  effect  on  VMT—has 
been  addressed  in  several  reports.  These  reports  indicate  that  changes  in  land  use 
can  reduce  VMT  growth—over  a  40  to  50  year  timeframe—by  approximately  5  to 
10 percent. 
Reducing  Greenhouse  Gases  Through  Congestion  Relief  and  Other 

Operational Strategies 

In tandem with efforts to develop cleaner vehicles and fuels and to reduce growth 
in  VMT,  it  also  is  possible  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  reducing  conges-
tion and encouraging more efficient operation of motor vehicles. 
Congestion Relief 

Traffic  congestion  contributes  to  greenhouse  gas  emissions  because  vehicle  en-
gines  operate  less  efficiently—and  therefore  produce  higher  emissions  per  mile— 
when  they  are  driven  at  low  speeds  in  stop-and-go  traffic.  The  optimal  speed  for 
motor  vehicles  with  internal  combustion  engines  is  about  45  mph.  At  lower  speeds, 
CO2 emissions per mile are several times higher than at 45 mph. At higher speeds, 
CO2 emissions  per  mile  increase  as  well,  but  somewhat  less  sharply.  As  such,  con-
gestion relief can play a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. If we can reduce 
the amount of fuel burned by vehicles stalled in traffic that is a gain. If we can im-
prove the flow of traffic so fuel is burned at more optimal efficiency rates then that 
will also produce a gain. 
Driver Behavior 

In  addition  to  vehicles,  fuels,  and  VMT,  the  way  motorists  actually  operate  their 
vehicles  affects  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  March  2007  TRB  report  notes  that: 
Recent  EAP  data  suggests  that  a  significant  component  of  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions—as  much  as  22  percent—results  from  inefficient  operation  of  motor  vehicles. 
These  inefficiencies  could  result  from  factors  beyond  the  driver’s  control,  such  as 
traffic congestion, and also could reflect a driver’s own behavior, such as high-speed 
driving, vehicle maintenance, and tire pressures. Driver education and other policies 
could  help  to  promote  more  efficient  vehicle  operations,  which  would  help  reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
The Impacts of Climate Change on the Transportation System 

While my testimony today focuses primarily on the role of the transportation sys-
tem  in  emitting  greenhouse  gases,  I  will  also  briefly  addresses  the  Transportation 
Research  Board’s  (TRB’s)  recent  report  on  the  potential  impacts  of  climate  change 
on the U.S. transportation system. 

Based on numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies, the TRB report identified five 
climate  changes  of  particular  importance  for  the  transportation  system  in  the  U.S.: 

• Increases in very hot days and heat waves, 
• Increases in Arctic temperatures, 
• Rising sea levels, 
• Increases in intense precipitation events, and 
• Increases in hurricane intensity. 
These changes in climate will affect the transportation system in many ways. The 
TRB  report  noted  several  specific  examples.  Just  a  few  of  these  examples  include:

• Operational  and  maintenance  impacts  of  excessive  heat.  ‘‘Periods  of  excessive 
summer  heat  are  likely  to  increase  wildfires,  threatening  communities  and  in-
frastructure directly and bringing about road and rail closures in affected areas. 
Longer  periods  of  extreme  heat  may  compromise  pavement  integrity  (e.g.,  soft-
ening  asphalt  and  increasing  rutting  from  traffic);  cause  deformation  of  rail 
lines  and  derailments  or,  at  a  minimum,  speed  restrictions;  and  cause  thermal 
expansion  of  bridge  joints,  adversely  affecting  bridge  operation  and  increasing 
maintenance costs.’’ 
• Increased  flooding  of  coastal  roads  and  rail  lines.  ‘‘The  most  immediate  impact 
of more intense precipitation will be increased flooding of coastal roads and rail 
lines.  Expected  sea  level  rise  will  aggravate  the  flooding  because  storm  surges 
will  build  on  a  higher  base,  reaching  farther  inland.  . . .  [The  IPCC]  identifies 
coastal  flooding  from  expected  sea  level  rise  and  storm  surge,  especially  along 
the  Gulf  and  Atlantic  coasts,  as  one  of  the  most  serious  effects  of  climate 
change.  Indeed,  several  studies  of  sea-level  rise  project  that  transportation  in-
frastructure  in  some  coastal  areas  along  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  and  the  Atlantic 
will be permanently inundated sometime in the next century.’’ 
• Disruption  of  coastal  waterway  systems.  ‘‘[A]  combination  of  sea  level  rise  and 
storm  surge  could  eliminate  waterway  systems  entirely.  For  example,  the  Gulf 
Coast portion of the intercoastal waterway will likely disappear with continued 
land subsidence and disappearance of barrier islands. This will bring an end to 
coastal  barge  traffic,  which  helps  offset  rail  and  highway  congestion;  all  ships 
will have to navigate the open seas.’’ 
• Impacts on Alaskan infrastructure. ‘‘The effects of temperature warming are al-
ready  being  experienced  in  Alaska  in  the  form  of  continued  retreat  of  perma-
frost  regions  (see  the  discussion  of  Alaska  below),  creating  land  subsidence 
issues  for  some  sections  of  the  road  and  rail  systems  and  for  some  of  the  ele-
vated supports for above-ground sections of the Trans-Alaska pipeline. Warming 
winter  temperatures  have  also  shortened  the  season  for  ice  roads  that  provide 
vital access to communities and industrial activities in remote areas.’’ 

Several  other  studies  have  also  concluded  that  climate  change  is  likely  to  have 
widespread  and  severe  impacts  on  transportation  infrastructure.  These  studies  in-
clude: 

• U.S.  DOT  Gulf  Coast  Study.  This  study  examined  the  potential  impacts  of  cli-
mate  change  on  transportation  infrastructure  in  the  Gulf  Coast  region.  The 
study recognized ‘‘four key climate drivers’’ in the Gulf Coast region: rising tem-
peratures,  changing  precipitation  patterns,  rising  sea  levels,  and  increasing 
storm  intensity.  It  suggested  a  range  of  possible  responses,  including  raising 
transportation  facilities  in  low-lying  areas;  hardening  them  to  withstand  storm 
events; relocating them to areas that are less vulnerable; and expanding redun-
dant systems where needed. 
• ICF  Studies  of  Sea-Level  Rise.  This  two-part  study  focused  specifically  on  the 
potential  impacts  of  sea-level  rise  (not  climate  change  in  general)  on  transpor-
tation  infrastructure.  Phase  1  assessed  impacts  of  sea-level  rise  on  the  District 
of  Columbia,  Maryland,  Virginia,  and  North  Carolina.  Phase  2,  which  is  still 
under way, will evaluate impacts of sea-level rise on seven additional States on 
the  East  Coast:  New  York,  New  Jersey,  Pennsylvania,  Delaware,  South  Caro-
lina, Georgia, and the Atlantic Coast of Florida. 

As these studies reflect, there is a growing consensus that climate change has al-
ready  begun  to  have  impacts  on  the  transportation  system  and  that  those  impacts 
will become more severe over time as the global climate continues to warm. 

Adapting  to  climate  change  will  present  challenges  for  all  levels  of  government. 
Rather than a single national program or strategy, there will likely be many initia-
tives  undertaken  in  response  to  the  specific  climate-related  threats  that  exist  in 
each region. 

For  the  transportation  system,  the  adaptation  challenges  will  be  substantial. 
There is a need for adaptation planning at the State and local level, because of the 
important  role  of  State  and  local  governments  in  maintaining  and  operating  the 
road  system.  According  to  the  Pew  Center  on  Global  Climate  Change,  five  States 
have adopted adaptation strategies (as of January 2008) as part of their comprehen-
sive climate action plans, while six others have started adaptation planning efforts. 
In  addition,  cities  and  counties  have  begun  to  address  adaptation  as  part  of  their 
climate plans. King County, Washington (which includes Seattle) has established an 
inter-departmental  team  to  develop  adaptation  plans  and  has  even  produced  a 
guidebook  on  this  issue.  New  York  City  has  addressed  adaptation  as  part  of

‘‘PlaNYC’’,  which  calls  for  planning  to  protect  critical  infrastructure  and  high-risk 
communities from the effects of climate change. 
Maryland Activities and Initiatives 

The  Maryland  Department  of  Transportation  (MDOT)  is  undertaking  various  ef-
forts  and  activities  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  in  Maryland,  including  participating 
in developing a statewide Greenhouse Gas and Carbon Footprint Reduction Strategy 
(GHG  Strategy)  and  promoting  sustainable  transit  communities.  MDOT  is  also  ac-
tive in evaluating what climate change and sea level rise will mean to our transpor-
tation  infrastructure  given  Maryland’s  4,360  miles  of  tidal  shoreline  and  our  trans-
portation system’s proximity to these areas. 

In  April  2007,  Governor  Martin  O’Malley  established  a  Climate  Change  Commis-
sion  through  Executive  Order  that  includes:  sixteen  agency  heads,  six  members  of 
the  General  Assembly,  private  sector  representatives  from  environmental  groups 
and  power  companies,  and  local  government  representatives.  This  Commission  is 
charged with: 

• Developing a plan of action to address climate change; 
• Preparing for climate change impacts in Maryland; 
• Establishing goals and timeframes; and 
• Reporting  each  year  (Nov.  1)  on  a  plan  of  action  including  updates,  timetables 

and draft legislation for the coming legislative session. 

Our preliminary goals are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 25 and 
50 percent between 2006 and 2020 and to obtain 90 percent reductions by 2050. The 
Commission’s preliminary report and list of strategies in various focus areas will be 
made  public  in  mid  July.  Transportation-related  policies  in  the  GHG  Strategy  in-
clude strategies to slow the growth of VMT, support the development and use of im-
proved technologies and fuels, and other emissions reduction strategies. 

Fortunately,  Maryland  is  in  a  unique  position  to  work  across  all  modes  of  trans-
portation  to  implement  GHG  reduction  strategies.  As  a  multi-modal  agency  with  a 
flexible transportation trust fund and responsibilities for highway, transit, port and 
airport  capital  development  and  operation,  MDOT  has  the  opportunity  to  act  effec-
tively.  The  department  has  already  undertaken  various  strategies  to  reduce  the 
growth in VMT including, developing park and ride lots, investing in transit expan-
sions, encouraging telecommuting, providing ridesharing and guaranteed ride home 
support, and progressing bike and pedestrian projects. Additional mitigation strate-
gies  include:  requiring  idling  reduction  in  MDOT  contracts,  utilizing  hybrid  buses 
and  cleaner  MARC  engines,  providing  truck  stop  electrification,  tree  planting,  use 
of biodiesel by MDOT trucks, and purchasing hybrid cars for our fleet. 

Climate change is bringing transit into the forefront of national policy discussions. 
In  Maryland,  transit  communities  are  a  priority,  however,  we  need  a  new  financial 
paradigm  for  supporting  transit.  Maryland  is  actively  pursuing  the  establishment 
of public/private partnerships related to transit oriented development while creating 
an equity position for the public sector. 

To  date,  most  public  private  activity  has  been  related  to  highways.  Maryland  is 
working  to  encourage  private  investments  in  transit.  We  are  anxious  to  find  ways 
to establish public private partnerships that allow the private sector to benefit from 
the  state’s  investment  in  transportation  while  sharing  some  of  the  benefit  with  the 
state.  We  would  like  to  create  public  private  partnerships  that  allow  the  state  to 
take  an  equity  position  in  land,  projects  and  businesses  that  benefit  directly  from 
the  transportation  asset,  or  in  the  transportation  asset  itself,  if  it  is  privatized. 
Under  this  structure,  ongoing  equity  returns  could  be  directed  toward  transit  oper-
ating costs. 
Conclusion 

Reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  worldwide  will  require  a  major  contribution 
from every country and every economic sector, including transportation. At the same 
time,  our  Nation  needs  a  strong  transportation  system  to  maintain  its  competitive-
ness  in  the  global  economy  and  to  expand  economic  opportunity  in  all  regions  and 
among all parts of the population. We need a strong transportation system to main-
tain and improve the quality of life by providing a high level of mobility while mini-
mizing impacts to communities and the environment. We need to achieve our trans-
portation  goals  in  a  way  that  is  environmentally  sustainable.  This  includes  effi-
ciently  reducing  the  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  from  the  transportation  sector 
as well taking other actions to minimize our carbon footprint. 

The  effort  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  will  involve  many  separate  initia-
tives.  Transportation  sector  initiatives  include,  improvements  in  fuel  economy; 
greater  usage  of  low-carbon  fuels;  better  management  of  our  transportation  system

to  reduce  congestion  and  smooth  traffic  flows;  and  taking  steps  that  reduce  the 
growth in vehicle miles traveled (VMT). 

Technological  innovation  is  the  key  to  progress  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions  re-
duction.  With  increases  in  fuel  economy  and  a  shift  to  cleaner  fuels,  it  is  possible 
to  reduce  greenhouse  gases  while  there  is  some  growth  in  VMT.  In  the  short  term, 
the  market  will  produce  additional  fuel  economy  and  increased  use  of  alternative 
fuels. New technologies including hydrogen fuel cells and plug-in electric hybrids are 
expected  to  enter  commercial  production  in  the  next  decade.  In  the  period  between 
2020  and  2050,  these  and  other  zero-emission  vehicles  which  no  longer  burn  petro-
leum  are  expected  to  dominate  the  automotive  market.  These  technologies  alone 
may make it possible to reach the carbon emission goals set by many Governors and 
mayors for 2050. 

The  growth  in  vehicle  miles  traveled  (VMT)  is  a  reflection  of  overall  growth  in 
our  economy  and  our  population.  However,  VMT  growth  is  already  flattening  due 
to  increasing  fuel  prices  and  long-term  demographic  changes.  Regardless  of  current 
VMT  trends  and  anticipated  technological  innovations  in  automotive  fuel  economy 
and fuels, additional measures should be taken to manage demand. Such measures 
include:  increasing  transit  ridership,  finding  alternatives  to  single  occupant  auto 
travel and removing the barriers to high density land use development. 

Greenhouse gas policies should be based on sound, comprehensive data, including 
data  regarding  the  cost  and  feasibility  of  accomplishing  emissions  reductions.  It  is 
ineffective  to  set  an  arbitrary  target  without  knowing  how  that  target  could  be 
achieved.  We  should  focus  on  finding  solutions  that  yield  the  greatest  emission  re-
ductions at the least cost. 

Also,  greenhouse  gas  policies  need  to  take  a  broad  and  balanced  approach  as  cli-
mate  change  solutions  will  vary  from  state  to  state  and  region  to  region.  As  such, 
individual states/regions should have the flexibility to implement the strategies that 
will  work  in  their  particular  circumstances.  It  is  imperative  that  transportation 
leaders  be  involved  in  the  climate  change  discussion  at  all  levels  of  government  to 
assist in developing emissions reductions strategies and goals. 

Finally, strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation 
sector cannot be effectively evaluated or carried out on a project level. A broad, sys-
tems-level approach is needed. 

Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee,  the  importance  of  the  subject  you 
have  under  discussion  today  is  of  vital  national  importance.  It  is  in  the  interest  of 
us  all  to  take  on  the  challenge  as  vigorously  and  effectively  as  we  can.  On  behalf 
of  the  AASHTO  member  states,  I  promise  that  we  will  continue  to  work  with  you 
in that effort. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Porcari.  And  I 
note that you are required to leave promptly, and Senator Stevens 
hasn’t  asked  to  throw  any  questions  at  you,  so  I  would  just  have 
one. 

And I’d like to know what kind of impacts of climate change are 
considered  before  DOT  undertakes  a  new  project  to  build  a  new 
road.  Should  they  be  required  to  identify  climate  change  impact? 
Mr.  PORCARI.  It’s  a  very  good  question,  Senator.  We’re—with 
Maryland  as  an  example,  we  are  currently,  actually,  mapping  all 
of the projected climate change impacts on all of our transportation 
infrastructure—roads,  rails,  bridges,  and  tunnels,  aviation,  et 
cetera.  Going  forward,  in  both  the  location  in  the  design  of  facili-
ties, we will be taking this into account. I would point out that we 
have a number of facilities that are severely impacted, like the Port 
of  Baltimore,  a  number  of  our  bridges  and  tunnels,  and  highway 
network.  You  have  similar  examples,  throughout  the  country, 
where  you  first  have  to  map  what  the  impacts  will  be,  and  then 
mitigate  that  in  new  construction,  and  reconstruction  of  older 
projects. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Just  one  more  thing.  How  complicating  a 
factor is it to make judgments on the effect on climate? Does it re-
quire  months  of  study  or  is  it  relatively  simple  computer  formula-
tion?

Mr.  PORCARI.  Senator,  we’re  really  plowing  new  ground  here. 
To—some  of  the  transportation  decisions  that  we’re  making,  such 
as doubling transit ridership, tripling our MARC commuter rail ca-
pacity,  are  relatively  straightforward.  We  know  those  will  have  a 
positive impact. We are now turning to the process of getting down 
to  the  project-specific  level  and  trying  to  quantify  those  impacts, 
positive  or  negative.  It  is  one  of  the  things  that  AASHTO  is  doing 
nationally  that  we  can  do  through  this  technical  assistance  pro-
gram,  is  provide  the  framework  for  all  the  states  to  make  those 
kind of evaluations in the future. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thank you very much, Mr. Porcari. 
Mr. PORCARI. Thank you. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. And thank the other panelists for their pa-

tience in letting us go ahead. 

Dr. Dickey, let me hear from you, please. 

STATEMENT OF G. EDWARD DICKEY, PH.D., AFFILIATE 

PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, LOYOLA COLLEGE IN 

MARYLAND; MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND 

U.S. TRANSPORTATION, TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH 

BOARD, DIVISION ON EARTH AND LIFE STUDIES, NATIONAL 

RESEARCH COUNCIL, THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES 

mittee. 

Dr. DICKEY. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the Com-

My name is Edward Dickey. I’m Affiliate Professor of Economics 
at  Loyola  College  in  Maryland,  and  I  served  as  a  Member  of  the 
National  Research  Council’s  Committee  on  Climate  Change  and 
U.S. Transportation. 

The charge given to our Committee was to examine the potential 
consequences of climate change on U.S. transportation. Our defini-
tion  of  ‘‘transportation’’  covers  all  the  modes.  Most  of  us  usually 
focus  on  transportation’s  impact  on  climate  change,  where  the  em-
phasis  is  on  strategies  to  mitigate  these  effects.  This  study  was 
concerned  with  the  converse,  examining  the  potential  impacts  of 
climate change on transportation infrastructure and operations and 
identifying appropriate adaptation strategies. 

The  main  findings  of  our  work  are  presented  in  Special  Report 
290,  ‘‘The  Potential  Impacts  of  Climate  Change  on  U.S.  Transpor-
tation.’’  The  report  begins  with  an  acknowledgment  that  global 
warming  is  a  real,  observable,  phenomena,  and  that  resulting  cli-
mate changes will be marked by weather and climate extremes and 
surprises, not gradual shifts. 

A second finding is that the use of historical weather and climate 
data may no longer provide an accurate forecasting guide for infra-
structure planning and design. 

Third, climate change will likely impact all regions of the country 
and  all  modes  of  transportation.  Flooding  of  coastal  transportation 
infrastructure  probably  poses  the  greatest  risk,  because  of  rising 
sea levels, coupled with storm surges and land subsidence. 

Fourth,  climate  change  will  require  significant  changes  in  the 
planning,  design,  construction,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of 
transportation systems. 

Last,  transportation  professionals  should  acknowledge  the  chal-
lenges  posed  by  climate  change,  and  incorporate  current  scientific

52 

knowledge  into  the  transportation  planning  process.  Investment 
choices  made  today  will  influence  how  well  the  transportation  in-
frastructure adapts far into the future. 

Our  recommendations  can  be  divided  into  two  broad  categories. 

We begin with the process of making decisions. 

First,  government  agencies  and  private  owners  should  inventory 
critical  infrastructure  to  determine  which  systems  are  vulnerable 
to the impacts of climate change. 

Second,  transportation  providers  should  incorporate  climate 
change  into  their  capital  improvement  programs,  facility  designs, 
maintenance  practices,  operations,  and  emergency  response  plans. 
Third,  planners  and  engineers  should  use  risk-based  approaches 
that  identify  the  tradeoffs  between  improved  performance  levels 
against  the  cost  of  achieving  them  when  analyzing  investment 
choices. 

Fourth,  better  communication  is  needed  among  transportation 
professionals,  climate  change  scientists,  and  other  related  dis-
ciplines. 

Fifth, ongoing and planned research on climate science and deci-
sionmaking tools should incorporate the needs of transportation de-
cisionmakers.  And  decisionmakers,  on  the  other  hand,  should  de-
fine  the  types  of  climate  data  that  would  be  most  useful  to  them. 
Turning  to  the  issue  of  adaptation  to  climate  change,  we  have  a 

number of additional recommendations. 

Sixth,  recent  experiences  with  Hurricanes  Katrina  and  Rita  em-
phasize  the  importance  of  making  transportation  an  integral  part 
of  response  plans  to  handle  emergencies,  and  how  these  plans  are 
executed. 

Seventh,  greater  use  of  technology  would  enable  infrastructure 
providers to monitor climate change and its possible deleterious ef-
fects on structures and systems. 

Eighth,  we  need  new  design  standards  that  incorporate  climate 
change.  The  Committee  recommends  that  the  U.S.  Department  of 
Transportation take the lead, along with professional organizations 
across all modes, to initiate, immediately, a multiyear, multi-agen-
cy research program. 

Ninth, in the short term, whenever possible, we need to rehabili-
tate or construct new transportation infrastructure to higher design 
standards, especially in vulnerable regions. 

Tenth,  transportation  organizations,  such  as  the  American  Asso-
ciation  of  State  and  Highway  Transportation  Officials,  in  coopera-
tion  with  the  Federal  Government,  should  develop  mechanisms  for 
sharing best practices. 

Eleventh,  we  would  be  remiss  if  we  did  not  mention  that  land 
use  is  an  important  issue.  Much  of  our  population  now  lives  near 
the  coasts,  placing  themselves,  their  homes,  their  businesses,  and 
their  transportation  systems  at  greater  risk.  Land-use  planning 
and zoning decisions are made primarily by local governments, and 
often involve competing interests that transportation planners can-
not  resolve.  However,  greater  collaboration  among  these  parties 
could  go  a  long  way  toward  putting  these  issues  on  the  table,  and 
such  collaboration  should  be  required  in  the  reauthorization  of 
transportation programs.

Twelfth, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which acts 
as  the  insurer  of  last  resort  for  homeowners  in  designated  flood 
hazard areas, should re-evaluate the risk reduction effectiveness of 
the  National  Flood  Insurance  Program,  in  view  of  projected  in-
creases in intense precipitation and storm activity. As a minimum, 
updating  flood  insurance  rate  maps  to  account  for  sea  level  rise 
and  to  incorporate  land  subsidence  should  be  priority  in  coastal 
areas. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF G.  EDWARD DICKEY,  PH.D.,  AFFILIATE PROFESSOR OF 
ECONOMICS,  LOYOLA COLLEGE IN MARYLAND;  MEMBER,  COMMITTEE ON 
CLIMATE CHANGE AND U.S. TRANSPORTATION, TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH BOARD, 
DIVISION ON EARTH AND LIFE STUDIES,  NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, 
THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES 
Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  My  name  is  Ed-
ward  Dickey.  I  am  Affiliate  Professor  of  Economics  at  Loyola  College  in  Maryland 
at  Baltimore  and  served  as  a  member  of  the  Committee  on  Climate  Change  and 
U.S.  Transportation  of  the  National  Research  Council.  The  Research  Council  is  the 
operating arm of the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineer-
ing, and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, chartered by Congress 
in 1863 to advise the government on matters of science and technology. 

Our  study  was  initiated  by  the  Executive  Committee  of  the  Transportation  Re-
search  Board  (TRB)  and  funded  by  TRB,  the  National  Cooperative  Highway  Re-
search  Program,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  (USDOT),  the  Transit  Co-
operative  Research  Program,  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  and  the 
U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers.  Dr.  Henry  G.  Schwartz,  Jr.,  retired  chairman  of 
Sverdrup/Jacobs  Civil,  Inc.,  and  member  of  the  National  Academy  of  Engineering, 
chaired the expert panel of 13 members who conducted the study.1 Our report—Spe-
cial Report 290: The Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation— 
provides transportation professionals with an overview of the scientific consensus on 
the  current  and  future  climate  changes  of  particular  relevance  to  U.S.  transpor-
tation,  including  the  limits  of  present  scientific  understanding  as  to  their  precise 
timing,  magnitude,  and  geographic  location;  identifies  potential  impacts  on  U.S. 
transportation  and  adaptation  options;  and  offers  recommendations  for  both  re-
search and actions that can be taken to prepare for climate change. 

The  study  concludes  that  transportation  professionals  should  acknowledge  the 
challenges  posed  by  climate  change  and  incorporate  current  scientific  knowledge 
into  the  planning,  design,  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  transpor-
tation systems. Every mode of transportation and every region in the United States 
will  be  affected  as  climate  change  poses  new  and  often  unfamiliar  challenges  to  in-
frastructure providers. Focusing on the problem now should help avoid costly future 
investments and disruptions to operations. 
Challenges of Climate Change 

Climate  change  will  affect  transportation  primarily  through  increases  in  several 
types  of  weather  and  climate  extremes.  Climate  warming  over  the  next  50  to  100 
years  will  be  manifested  by  rising  sea  levels  coupled  with  storm  surges  and  land 
subsidence, increases in very hot days and heat waves, increases in Arctic tempera-
tures,  more  frequent  intense  precipitation  events,  and  increases  in  the  intensity  of 
strong  hurricanes.  The  impacts  will  vary  by  mode  of  transportation  and  region  of 
the  country,  but  they  will  be  widespread  and  costly  in  both  human  and  economic 
terms and will require significant changes in the planning, design, construction, op-
eration, and maintenance of transportation systems.

The  past  several  decades  of  historical  regional  climate  patterns  commonly  used 
by transportation planners to guide their operations and investments may no longer 
be  a  reliable  guide  for  future  plans.  In  particular,  future  climate  will  include  new 
classes  (in  terms  of  magnitude  and  frequency)  of  weather  and  climate  extremes, 
such  as  record  rainfall  and  record  heat  waves,  not  experienced  in  modern  times  as 
human-induced changes are superimposed on the natural variability of the climate. 
Decisions transportation professionals take today, particularly those related to the 
redesign and retrofitting of existing transportation infrastructure or the location and 
design  of  new  infrastructure,  will  affect  how  well  the  system  adapts  to  climate 
change far into the future. 
Addressing the Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 
Inventory Critical Infrastructure 

Potentially,  the  greatest  impact  of  climate  change  on  North  America’s  transpor-
tation  system  will  be  flooding  of  coastal  roads,  railways,  transit  systems,  and  run-
ways because of a global rise in sea level coupled with storm surge and exacerbated 
in some locations by land subsidence. The vulnerability of transportation infrastruc-
ture  to  climate  change,  however,  will  extend  well  beyond  coastal  areas.  Therefore, 
Federal,  state,  and  local  governments,  in  collaboration  with  owners  and  operators 
of infrastructure such as ports and airports, and private railroad and pipeline com-
panies  should  inventory  critical  transportation  infrastructure  to  identify  whether, 
when,  and  where  projected  climate  changes  in  particular  regions  might  be  con-
sequential. 
Incorporate Climate Change into Investment Decisions 

Public  authorities  and  officials  at  various  governmental  levels  and  executives  of 
private  companies  are  making  short-  and  long-term  investment  decisions  every  day 
and  should  incorporate  climate  change  into  their  long-term  capital  improvement 
plans,  facility  designs,  maintenance  practices,  operations,  and  emergency  response 
plans.  (See  box  below,  which  lays  out  a  six-step  approach  for  determining  appro-
priate investment priorities). 

Adopt Strategic, Risk-Based Approaches to Decision Making 

The  significant  costs  of  redesigning  and  retrofitting  transportation  infrastructure 
to adapt to the potential impacts of climate change suggest the need for more stra-
tegic,  risk-based  approaches  to  investment  decisions.  Transportation  planners  and 
engineers should incorporate more probabilistic investment analyses and design ap-
proaches that apply techniques for trading off the costs of making the infrastructure

more  robust  against  the  economic  costs  of  failure  and  should  communicate  these 
trade-offs  to  policymakers  who  make  investment  decisions  and  authorize  funding. 
One  model  is  the  California  Seismic  Retrofit  Program,  which  uses  a  risk-based  ap-
proach to analyze vulnerability to earthquakes and criticality of highway bridges to 
determine priorities for retrofitting and replacement. 
Improve Communication 

Transportation  decisionmakers  note  that  one  of  the  most  difficult  aspects  of  ad-
dressing climate change is obtaining the relevant information in the form they need 
to  plan  and  design.  Transportation  professionals  often  lack  sufficiently  detailed  in-
formation  about  expected  climate  changes  and  their  timing  to  take  appropriate  ac-
tion. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, USDOT, the U.S. Geo-
logical Survey, and other relevant agencies should work together to institute a proc-
ess for better communication among transportation professionals, climate scientists, 
and  those  in  other  relevant  scientific  disciplines,  and  establish  a  clearinghouse  for 
transportation-relevant climate change information. In addition, better decision sup-
port tools are needed to assist transportation decisionmakers. Ongoing and planned 
research  at  Federal  and  state  agencies  and  universities  that  provides  climate  data 
and  decision  support  tools  should  include  the  needs  of  transportation  decision-
makers. 
Integrate  Evacuation  Planning  and  Emergency  Response  into  Transportation 

Operations 

Projected  increases  in  weather  and  climate  extremes  underscore  the  importance 
of emergency response plans in vulnerable locations and require that transportation 
providers  work  more  closely  with  weather  forecasters  and  emergency  planners  and 
assume  a  greater  role  in  evacuation  planning  and  emergency  response.  Climate  ex-
tremes,  such  as  more  intense  storms  and  more  intense  precipitation,  will  require 
near-term operational responses from transportation providers and greater attention 
to  emergency  response  in  transportation  operations  and  budgets.  Transportation 
agencies  and  service  providers  should  build  on  the  experience  in  locations  where 
transportation is well integrated into emergency response and evacuation plans. 
Develop and Implement Monitoring Technologies 

Monitoring  transportation  infrastructure  conditions,  particularly  the  impacts  of 
weather and climate extremes, offers an alternative to preventive retrofitting or re-
construction  of  some  facilities  in  advance  of  climate  change.  Greater  use  of  sensors 
and  other  ‘‘smart’’  technologies  would  enable  infrastructure  providers  to  receive  ad-
vance  warning  of  potential  failure  due  to  water  levels  and  currents,  wave  action, 
winds,  and  temperatures  exceeding  what  the  infrastructure  was  designed  to  with-
stand.  Federal  and  academic  research  programs  should  encourage  the  development 
and implementation of these technologies. 
Share Best Practices 

As  the  climate  changes,  many  U.S.  locations  will  experience  new  climate-induced 
weather patterns. The geographic extent of the United States—from Alaska to Flor-
ida and from Maine to Hawaii—and its diversity of weather and climate conditions 
can  provide  a  laboratory  for  best  practices  and  information  sharing  as  the  climate 
changes.  Drawing  on  existing  technology  transfer  mechanisms,  relevant  transpor-
tation  professional  and  research  organizations  should  develop  a  mechanism  to  en-
courage sharing of best practices to address the potential impacts of climate change. 
Reevaluate Design Standards 

Environmental  factors  are  integral  to  transportation  infrastructure  design.  How-
ever,  engineers  have  not  given  much  thought  to  whether  current  design  standards 
are  sufficient  to  accommodate  climate  change.  Climate  change  projections  indicate 
that today’s 100-year precipitation event is likely to occur every 50 years or perhaps 
even every 20 years by the end of this century. Reevaluating, developing, and regu-
larly updating design standards for transportation infrastructure to address the im-
pacts of climate change will require a broad-based research and testing program and 
a  substantial  implementation  effort.  USDOT  should  take  a  leadership  role  along 
with  professional  organizations  in  the  forefront  of  civil  engineering  practice  across 
all modes to initiate immediately a federally funded, multiagency research program. 
The program should focus on the reevaluation of existing design standards and the 
development of new standards as progress is made in understanding future climate 
conditions  and  the  options  available  for  addressing  them.  A  research  plan  and  cost 
proposal should be developed for submission to Congress for authorization and fund-
ing.  Until  new  standards  are  developed,  infrastructure  rehabilitation  projects  in 
highly vulnerable locations should be rebuilt to higher standards.

56 

The development of appropriate design standards to accommodate climate change 
is  only  one  of  several  possible  adaptation  strategies  that  may  require  Federal  lead-
ership, research, and funding. Federal agencies have not focused generally on adap-
tation  in  addressing  climate  change.  Better  collaboration  could  help  focus  attention 
on these issues and shape existing research programs. USDOT should take the lead 
in developing an interagency working group focused on adaptation. 
Include Climate Change in Transportation and Land Use Planning 

One  of  the  most  effective  strategies  for  reducing  the  risks  of  climate  change  is  to 
avoid placing people and infrastructure in vulnerable locations. Transportation plan-
ners  are  not  currently  required  to  consider  climate  change  and  its  effects  on  infra-
structure investments. Land use decisions are made primarily by local governments, 
which  have  too  limited  a  perspective  to  account  for  the  broadly  shared  risks  of  cli-
mate  change.  Integration  between  transportation  and  land  use  planning  is  uncom-
mon.  Federal  planning  regulations  should  require  that  climate  change  be  included 
as  a  factor  in  the  development  of  public-sector,  long-range  transportation  plans; 
eliminate  any  perception  that  such  plans  be  limited  to  20  to  30  years;  and  require 
collaboration  in  plan  development  with  agencies  responsible  for  land  use,  environ-
mental  protection,  and  natural  resource  management  to  foster  more  integrated 
transportation-land use decisionmaking. 
Evaluate the National Flood Insurance Program and Flood Insurance Rate Maps 

The Federal Government is the insurer of last resort for homeowners in specially 
designated flood hazard areas. The National Flood Insurance Program, administered 
by  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA),  and  the  flood  insurance 
rate  maps  (FIRMs)  that  determine  program  eligibility  do  not  take  climate  change 
into  account.  FEMA  should  reevaluate  the  risk  reduction  effectiveness  of  the  Na-
tional Flood Insurance Program and the FIRMs, particularly because climate change 
may  trigger  more  intense  storms  and  sea-level  rise  will  extend  the  scope  of  flood 
damage in some special flood hazard areas. At a minimum, updated FIRMs that ac-
count for sea level rise (incorporating land subsidence) should be a priority in coast-
al areas. 
Develop New Organizational Arrangements 

The  impacts  of  climate  change  do  not  follow  modal,  corporate,  or  jurisdictional 
boundaries,  yet  decisionmaking  in  the  transportation  sector  is  based  on  these 
boundaries. Current institutional arrangements for transportation planning and op-
erations were not organized to address climate change and may not be adequate for 
the purpose. Some models of cross-jurisdictional cooperation exist. Among them are 
regional  authorities  for  specific  facilities  (e.g.,  the  Alameda  Corridor);  regional  and 
multistate  emergency  response  agreements;  and  state-mandated  regional  authori-
ties,  such  as  those  responsible  for  air  quality  improvement.  Similar  arrangements 
could emerge to address the effects of sea-level rise on coastal real estate and infra-
structure,  drought  on  shipping  along  inland  waterways,  and  hurricanes  in  the  Gulf 
Coast  region.  However,  state  or  Federal  incentives  may  be  required  to  ensure  the 
development  of  such  organizational  arrangements  at  the  regional  or  multistate 
level. 

Actions  to  prepare  for  climate  change  can  be  taken  almost  immediately.  Some 
steps can be undertaken by local governments and private infrastructure providers. 
Others  depend  on  Federal  and  state  action.  In  all  cases,  leadership  and  continuing 
commitment are essential. 

Thank you for inviting me to testify today. I would be happy to address any ques-

tions the Committee might have. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Mr. Friedman? 

STATEMENT OF DAVID FRIEDMAN, RESEARCH DIRECTOR AND 
SENIOR ENGINEER, THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS 
Mr. FRIEDMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I’m  the  Research  Director  and  a  Senior  Engineer  for  the  Union 
of  Concerned  Scientists.  Thank  you  for  holding  this  hearing,  be-
cause the topic is extremely urgent. 

Put  simply,  global  warming  is  the  largest  long-term  environ-
mental  threat  facing  the  country  and  the  world.  If  we  are  to  avoid 
the  worst  impacts  of  climate  change,  our  country  must  cut  global

warming  pollution  by  at  least  80  percent  in  2050,  when  compared 
to  emission  levels  in  the  year  2000.  Of  course,  we  can’t  just  sit 
around  and  wait,  for  decades,  to  begin.  U.S.  global  warming  pollu-
tion  must  be  cut  by  more  than  20  percent  below  2000  levels  by 
2020. 

For transportation to play a role, we need to rethink the system. 
In  doing  so,  we  will  not  only  dramatically  lower  global  warming 
pollution,  we  will  cut  our  addiction  to  oil,  we  will  save  consumers 
billions, and we will create new high-quality jobs throughout Amer-
ica. 

One of the important tools that must be put in place is an econ-
omy-wide  cap-and-trade  policy.  But,  while  a  cap  is  essential  to 
curbing  global  warming  pollution,  it  will  not  push  the  transpor-
tation sector to do its share over the next 20 to 30 years. 

Recent  analysis  from  the  Energy  Information  Administration 
shows  that  others  must  pick  up  the  slack.  As  a  result,  it  will  be 
more expensive to control global warming pollution. 

A  cap-and-trade  market  fails  transportation  consumers,  because 
there are too few alternatives to going about our daily travel. Con-
sumers and corporations need better vehicles, viable alternatives to 
cars  and  freight  trucks,  and  sustainable  fuels  with  a  low  global 
warming pollution footprint. And they need these solutions as soon 
as possible, much faster than the market can provide. 

This Committee is already quite familiar with policies to require 
better  vehicles.  The  Ten-in-Ten  Fuel  Economy  Act,  by  requiring  at 
least  a  10-mile-per-gallon  increase  in  fuel  economy  for  cars  and 
trucks,  will  cut  new  vehicle  global  warming  pollution  by  nearly  30 
percent. It will also save consumers money at the pump. At today’s 
$4.00 per gallon, the 35-mile-per-gallon minimum is the equivalent 
of  cutting  gas  prices  by  more  than  one  dollar.  The  Committee  also 
opened the door to fuel economy standards for medium- and heavy- 
duty  trucks.  But,  the  Committee’s  work  is  far  from  over.  Rail,  air, 
and shipping can also benefit from improved efficiency. 

There  is  also  more  work  to  be  done  in  the  fuel  economy  of  cars 
and  trucks  of  all  shapes  and  sizes.  Despite  the  fact  that  their  own 
analysis  indicates  that  we  could  reach  the  35-mile-per-gallon  min-
imum  fuel  economy  standard  by  2015—that  is  5  years  early—the 
Department  of  Transportation  is  relying  on  a  flawed  rulemaking 
that, at best, just barely puts cars and trucks on the road to 35 by 
2020. 

In  their  work,  NHTSA  relied  on  gas  price  projections  of  $2.25  to 
$2.50  per  gallon.  Gas  is  over  $4.00  a  gallon  today.  Even  the  head 
of  the  Energy  Information  Administration  recently  publicly  said 
that  the  Department  of  Transportation  should  use  their  high  oil 
and gas price scenario, not the scenario they used. 

Further,  NHTSA  effectively  ignored  the  cost  of  global  warming 
and assumed hybrids would not be available until 2014, despite the 
fact that the Toyota Prius, a hybrid, is the ninth-best-selling car in 
the  country  today.  Instead  of  doing  the  bare  minimum  to  satisfy 
the law, NHTSA should put cars and trucks on a path to 40 miles 
per  gallon  by  2020,  and  at  least  50  by  2030.  This  will  cut  global 
warming  pollution  from  new  cars  and  trucks  in  half  by  2030,  and 
would save about 50 billion barrels of oil through 2050.

Of  course,  efficiency  isn’t  enough.  Both  urban  and  suburban 
areas need greater access to public transportation. As of 2001, less 
than  one-third  of  the  U.S.  population  lived  within  about  a  block  of 
a bus line, and only about one-quarter lived within 5 miles of a rail 
stop. Consumers also need improved access to high-occupancy-vehi-
cle lanes, bike lanes, and more affordable housing near where they 
work. Corporations need many of the same solutions. 

For these options to work, we will need money to fund them and 
the  willingness  to  use  them.  Whether  it  is  pay-as-you-drive  insur-
ance,  road-user  fees,  per-mile  congestion  fees,  charging  per  mile 
rather  than  per  year  or  per  gallon  can  create  a  revenue  stream  to 
allow  us  to  repair  our  roads  and  bridges,  plus  to  provide  funding 
for  transit  and  other  alternatives.  We  are  already  paying  these 
costs,  but  consumers  don’t  see  it  in  their  daily  lives.  Making  them 
visible will provide a direct incentive to use the newly available al-
ternatives. 

In addition, we also need to clean up our fuels. By 2050, we need 
the  equivalent  of  150  to  200  billion  gallons  of  gasoline  with  as 
much  as  an  80-percent  reduction  in  global  warming  pollution  com-
pared to today’s gasoline. 

To supply this fuel, we must tap into sustainable biofuels, renew-
able  electricity,  and  clean  hydrogen.  But,  these  resources  will  not 
appear  overnight,  nor  will  the  vehicles  that  must  be  sold  to  use 
these  low-carbon  fuels.  We  need  to  institute  a  low-carbon  fuel 
standard. And, because plug-ins, fuel-cell vehicles, and battery-elec-
tric  vehicles  are  currently  significantly  more  expensive  than  even 
hybrids,  we  will  need  a  combination  of  performance-based  vehicle 
incentives  and  an  ultra-low-carbon  vehicle  requirement.  Policies 
like these will help us rethink our transportation system. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  an  engineer,  and,  as  such,  I  was  trained  to 
be  a  problem-solver.  And  climate  change  is  the  largest  long-term 
environmental  threat  there  is.  We  have  the  necessary  solutions  to 
deal with this problem. What we have lacked is the will. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID FRIEDMAN, RESEARCH DIRECTOR AND SENIOR 

ENGINEER, THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS 

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to 
testify  before  you  today.  I  am  a  research  director  and  senior  engineer  with  the 
Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). UCS is a leading science-based nonprofit that 
has  been  working  for  a  healthy  environment  and  a  safer  world  for  over  30  years. 
The  topic  of  this  hearing,  transportation  and  climate  change,  could  not  be  more 
urgent.  Put  simply,  global  warming  is  the  single  biggest  long  term  environmental 
threat facing the country and the world. But within this threat are buried opportu-
nities.  Every  step  we  take  to  curb  transportation’s  role  in  global  warming  will  also 
cut  America’s  oil  addiction—and  most,  if  not  all,  of  these  will  also  save  consumers 
money.  At  the  same  time,  the  investments  we  make  to  become  the  world’s  leader 
in climate change solutions will strengthen our economy as we export the technology 
that will be essential to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. 
Transportation, Targets, and Climate Caps 
If we are to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, our nation and the world 
must  adopt  a  target  that  will  keep  global  temperature  from  rising  more  than  2  °C 
above pre-industrial levels. That means stabilizing the concentration of global warm-
ing pollutants in our atmosphere at no more than 450 parts per million carbon diox-
ide  equivalent.  Analysis  by  UCS  shows  that  one  part  of  achieving  this  goal  means 
the United States must cut global warming pollution by at least 80 percent compared

to  emission  levels  in  2000.1 In  addition,  UCS  analysis  indicates  that  U.S.  global 
warming  pollution  must  be  cut  by  more  than  20  percent  below  2000  levels  by  2020, 
and at least 50 percent below by 2030. 

There is no single silver bullet that will dramatically cut U.S. global warming pol-
lution and no single sector will be able to carry the full burden. Instead, the country 
will have to put in place a comprehensive climate and energy policy that encourages 
a diverse portfolio of solutions in every sector. Transportation, including the cars and 
trucks  consumers  drive  every  day,  will  have  to  play  a  significant  role  in  meeting 
this  essential  80  percent  reduction  minimum  and  all  options  for  cutting  pollution 
from transportation must be on the table. The good news is that every sector, includ-
ing transportation, has many tools at its disposal. 

The  debate  has  already  begun  on  one  of  the  most  important  tools  that  must  be 
put  in  place  to  limit  the  total  amount  of  global  warming  pollution  humans  create: 
a  cap-and-trade  policy  that  would  ensure  that  the  U.S.  is  on  a  path  to  do  its  part 
to limit global temperatures from rising above 2 °C, including at least an 80 percent 
reduction in U.S. global warming pollution by 2050. 

This  cap  must  apply  to  all  sectors,  including  transportation,  but  even  that  will 
still not be enough to ensure that transportation does its part. While it needed sig-
nificant  strengthening,  the  recently  discussed  Climate  Security  Act  (S.  2191)  pro-
vides  a  good  example  of  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  cap-and-trade  policy.  By 
2030, EIA estimated that S. 2191 would cut global warming pollution by more than 
30  percent  compared  to  emissions  in  2000.2 However,  at  the  same  time  that  most 
sectors are projected to contribute reductions of 40 percent to 80 percent, the trans-
portation sector is projected to continue to increase.

Security Act (S. 2191). 

Supporting Transportation Climate Policy on a Three-Legged Stool 

The  transportation  sector  simply  does  not  do  its  share  under  a  cap-and-trade  sys-
tem.  Instead,  despite  the  fact  that  many  transportation  solutions  can  save  money 
while  cutting  global  warming  pollution,  other  sectors  must  pick  up  the  slack  to  en-
sure that the overall cap is still met. This dynamic is a sign of market failures that 
will lead to higher costs than are necessary for controlling global warming pollution. 
Put  simply,  the  market  fails  transportation  consumers  because  there  are  too  few 
alternatives  to  doing  things  other  than  the  way  we  have  been  doing  them  for  the 
past sixty years:

• Most of the planes, trains, ships, and automobiles we rely on were designed dur-
ing  the  days  of  cheap  oil  when  fuel  efficiency  was  not  a  priority.  Manufacturers 
have been slow to respond to recent consumer demands for fuel economy. In ad-
dition, consumers have shown themselves slow to change. Gas prices have more 
than  tripled  since  2000  and  consumers  have  only  just  begun  to  shift  their  pur-
chasing and driving habits. 

• Both  personal  travel  and  goods  movement  have  evolved  around  our  extensive 
and  dispersed  national  highway  system.  Compact,  walk-able  or  bike-able  com-
munities and easy access to transit are the exception rather than the rule. Con-
sumers  and  corporations  lack  choices  to  substitute  for  reliance  on  our  cars  and 
trucks. 

• The transportation sector is almost exclusively reliant on fossil fuels, a fuel with 
a very high global warming footprint. Alternative fuels meet only about 0.2 per-
cent of U.S. transportation fuel needs. 

These faults can be fixed by moving beyond the piecemeal approach that has his-
torically  characterized  U.S.  energy  and  transportation  policy  and  instead  applying 
a  comprehensive  approach  that  addresses  these  three  market  failures  to  build  a 
solid  foundation  to  support  transportation’s  role  in  a  national  cap-and-trade  policy. 
Increasing Fuel Economy 

To tackle global warming, reduce America’s oil addiction, and save consumers tens 
of  billions  of  dollars,  we  must  give  consumers  and  corporations  new  options  to  use 
fuel  more  efficiently  when  they  travel  or  ship  goods.  This  can  be  achieved  either 
through  vehicle  global  warming  pollution  standards  or  by  setting  fuel  economy 
standards. 

Through the Ten in Ten Fuel Economy Act, this Committee led the Nation forward 
on  fuel  economy  for  cars  and  light  trucks  for  the  first  time  in  more  than  three  dec-
ades. And for the first time ever, the door was opened to fuel economy standards for 
medium and heavy duty trucks thanks to this Committee. 

The projected benefits of just the light-duty portion of the Ten in Ten Fuel Econ-
omy  Act  highlight  the  importance  of  keeping  efficiency  a  top  priority.  Meeting  the 
minimum  fuel  economy  requirement  of  35  miles  per  gallon  would  cut  global  warm-
ing pollution for new cars and trucks nearly 30 percent by 2020. The minimum will 
also reduce oil consumption by nearly 9 billion barrels through 2030, rising to about 
30  billion  barrels  saved  through  2050.  And  finally,  boosting  fuel  economy  from  to-
day’s 25 mpg average to 35 mpg will save consumers the equivalent of reducing the 
price of today’s $4 per gallon gasoline by more than one dollar. 

The example of car and truck efficiency must be repeated and reinforced through-
out  the  transportation  sector.  Delivery  trucks  and  18-wheelers  could  increase  fuel 
economy  from  today’s  level  of  less  than  7  mpg  for  new  vehicles  to  10–11.5  mpg  by 
2030.  This  represents  a  boost  of  50–70  percent  while  maintaining  or  expanding  to-
day’s  hauling  capacity.  However,  because  of  language  in  Ten  in  Ten,  it  may  be  at 
least  8  years  before  this  committee’s  medium  and  heavy  duty  standards  are  put  to 
work. Given the significant impacts the freight sector will feel from climate change, 
this committee should work to accelerate the Department of Transportation’s report-
ing and rulemaking responsibilities in this area. 

Rail, air, and shipping can also benefit from improved efficiency. For example, rail 

efficiency could be improved by about 1 percent per year starting in 2015. 

Finally,  there  is  more  work  to  be  done  on  the  fuel  economy  of  cars  and  trucks. 
A  recent  UCS  report  indicates  that  automakers  can  cost-effectively  boost  the 
fleetwide  average  fuel  economy  of  cars  and  trucks  to  40  mpg  by  2020  and  to  more 
than  50  mpg  by  2030.3 Yet  the  recent  notice  of  proposed  rulemaking  from  the  De-
partment  of  Transportation’s  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration 
(NHTSA), at best, just barely puts cars and trucks on the road to the 35 mpg min-
imum by 2020.4 

Instead  of  doing  the  bare  minimum  to  satisfy  the  law,  NHTSA  should  put  cars 
and  trucks  on  a  path  to  40  mpg  by  2020  and  at  least  50  mpg  by  2030.  This  would 
cut  global  warming  pollution  from  new  cars  and  trucks  in  half  by  2030  and  would 
save about 50 billion barrels of oil through 2050. 

NHTSA  appears  unwilling  or  unable  to  move  the  country  on  this  path  and  this 
Committee  should  exercise  its  oversight  authority  to  ask  NHTSA  to  fix  a  variety  of 
flaws used in setting their proposed standards:

• While  gasoline  prices  soared  above  $3  per  gallon  this  winter  and  have  crossed 
$4 per gallon this summer, NHTSA relied on projections of $2.25–$2.50 per gal-
lon. 
• While  carbon  dioxide  is  currently  trading  at  more  than  $40  per  metric  ton  in 
Europe, NHTSA used a value of $7 per ton. NHTSA even considered $0 per ton 
to  be  in  the  range  of  possible  values,  implying  that  global  warming  does  not 
exist or will cause no harm. 

• NHTSA left out the military and strategic costs of America’s oil addiction. 
• NHTSA  assumed  light  trucks  would  grow  in  market  share,  but  between  2005 
and  2008  the  market  share  of  light  trucks  sold  from  January  to  May  dropped 
from 54 percent to 48 percent. 
• NHTSA assumed hybrids were not available until 2014 despite the fact that the 
• NHTSA  based  its  rulemaking  on  costs  and  benefits  on  the  margin  rather  than

the total costs and benefits of improved standards. 

Changes  along  these  lines  would  redirect  NHTSA’s  efforts  to  the  intent,  not  just 
the letter, of the law passed as part of Ten in Ten. NHTSA’s own analysis confirms 
that  simply  switching  to  total  benefits,  even  with  their  poor  gas  price  assumptions, 
would  have  led  them  to  propose  a  fleetwide  average  of  at  least  35  mpg  by  2015— 
five  years  earlier  than  the  required  minimum.5 More  realistic  gas  prices,  even  only 
setting  the  standard  based  on  the  marginal  benefits,  would  also  have  led  NHTSA 
to propose a fleetwide average over about 35 mpg by 2015.6 

Making  matters  worse,  not  only  will  NHTSA’s  poor  analysis  shortchange  con-
sumers and lead to lower global warming pollution reductions, we can expect a simi-
lar approach to shortchange trucking companies and the environment when NHTSA 
address fuel economy standards for medium and heavy duty vehicles. This Commit-
tee’s oversight role is essential to avoiding this outcome. 
Smarter Travel, Freight, Cities 

While  great  strides  can  be  made  to  improve  vehicle  efficiency,  it  is  unlikely  that 
technology  alone  will  be  able  to  keep  pace  with  growing  demand  for  personal  and 
freight  travel  if  we  continue  on  our  current  path.  As  a  result,  despite  the  potential 
for parts of the transportation sector to increase efficiency by 50 percent or 100 per-
cent, global warming pollution from transportation will continue to increase beyond 
current levels. 

For  example,  if  projected  trends  from  the  Energy  Information  Administration’s 
Annual Energy Outlook 2008 continue through 2050, medium and heavy duty vehi-
cles  could  see  demand  increase  by  more  than  130  percent.  If  the  fuel  economy  of 
all delivery trucks and 18-wheelers on the road were increased by about 70 percent, 
that  would  still  not  be  enough  to  compensate  for  the  increase  in  demand.  As  a  re-
sult, global warming pollution in this sector would still rise by more than 20 percent 
in  2050  compared  to  levels  in  2000.  Compared  to  a  goal  of  an  80  percent  reduction 
in global warming pollution, a 20 percent increase clearly won’t cut it. 

Growing travel demand is a core barrier to avoiding the worst impacts of climate 
change,  but  historical  travel  growth  has  also  been  a  key  part  of  U.S.  economic 
growth.  The  challenge  is  to  rethink  and  redesign  our  transportation  system  to  allow 
for continued economic growth without as many miles. 

As  with  efficiency,  the  first  step  is  to  ensure  that  consumers  and  corporations 
have  alternatives  other  than  business  as  usual.  Both  urban  and  suburban  areas 
need greater access to public transportation, which produces significantly less global 
warming pollution per person than cars and trucks. As of 2001, less than one-third 
of  the  U.S.  population  lived  within  about  a  block  of  a  bus  line,  while  only  about  40 
percent  lived  within  a  half  mile.7 The  situation  is  even  worse  for  rail,  where  only 
about  10  percent  of  U.S.  population  lived  within  a  mile  of  a  rail  stop,  while  only 
about one quarter lived within five miles.8 

In  addition  to  transit,  consumers  need  improved  access  to  high  occupancy  vehicle 
(HOV)  lanes,  bike  lanes,  and  more  affordable  housing  near  where  they  work.  Cor-
porations  need  many  of  the  same  things.  While  18-wheelers  provide  a  lot  of  flexi-
bility  in  the  freight  world,  it  takes  5–7  times  more  energy  to  ship  a  ton  of  goods

on  a  truck  than  on  rail—switching  more  miles  from  long-haul  trucking  to  rail  will 
put  a  real  dent  in  global  warming  pollution  from  freight.  Trucks  and  buses  might 
also benefit from their own dedicated lanes where they are not caught up in as much 
stop and go traffic, making highways safer as well. 

For  these  various  new  options  to  work,  two  key  resources  are  needed:  the  money 
to fund them and the willingness to use them. Thankfully, in many cases, a system 
that makes sure people and products carry the full cost of their travel can help with 
both.  Whether  it  is  insurance,  wear  and  tear  on  highways  and  bridges,  or  the  costs 
of  the  pollution  produced  from  tailpipes,  charging  per  mile  rather  than  per  year  or 
per  gallon  can  create  both  a  revenue  stream  for  the  needed  investments  and  a  more 
direct incentive to try out the newly available approaches. 

Some examples of these approaches include: 
• Pay  as  you  drive  insurance:  If  you  drive  less,  you  are  less  likely  to  get  into  an 
accident.  Paying  for  insurance  by  the  mile  rather  than  just  by  the  car  would 
both  provide  a  more  equitable  distribution  of  insurance  payments  and  encour-
age people to drive less. 
• Per  mile  road  user  fees:  Current  highway  construction  and  maintenance  costs, 
and  some  transit  costs,  are  covered  by  per  gallon  fuel  taxes.  Because  fuel  effi-
ciency  must  go  up  to  address  global  warming,  projected  tax  receipts  will  go 
down  compared  to  a  business  as  usual  scenario.  Per  mile  road  user  fees,  ad-
justed  to  vehicle  weight,  could  maintain  a  steadily  growing  revenue  stream  to 
keep our roads and bridges from falling apart while encouraging consumers and 
corporations to seek less expensive alternatives. 
• Per  mile  pollution  or  congestion  fees:  Accidents  and  wear  and  tear  are  not  the 
only costs associated with every mile we drive. Vehicles of all sizes cause smog- 
forming  and  toxic  pollution  that  lead  to  increased  health  care  costs  and  even 
fatalities.  Traffic  also  costs  time  because  of  the  delays  created  by  congestion. 
Per  mile  pollution  and  congestion  fees  can  become  steady  funding  sources  to 
hold  people  responsible  for  the  damage  they  create  while  creating  a  funding 
stream for alternatives, plus they would provide another incentive to drive less. 
Per  mile  pollution  and  congestion  fees  tied  to  air  travel  and  freight  could  be 
great ways to finance high-speed rail or simply much needed reinvestment into 
the country’s conventional rail infrastructure. 
• Location  efficient  mortgages:  Current  tax  codes  give  consumers  the  same  break 
on  their  mortgage  interest  no  matter  where  they  live.  While  these  tax  breaks 
have  helped  many  live  out  the  American  dream  of  owning  a  house,  they  have 
also helped lower the cost of owning homes that are farther from where people 
work,  increasing  daily  travel.  Revamping  that  tax  code  to  provide  greater  tax 
breaks  for  those  who  live  closer  to  work  or  transit  will  still  help  people  realize 
a  part  of  the  American  dream  while  ensuring  it  does  not  become  a  nightmare 
of pollution and congestion. 

This is not intended to be an exhaustive list, but instead points the way to policies 
and  practices  that  could  help  cut  projected  personal  travel  by  25  percent  to  35  per-
cent  by  2050  (15  percent–20  percent  by  2030)  and  could  contribute  to  reducing  the 
amount of freight that is trucked by 20 percent or more by 2050. Even more innova-
tive  approaches,  such  as  reserving  downtown  areas  for  walking,  biking,  and  public 
transit, or directly integrating our personal and freight vehicles with a mass transit 
system,  could  be  part  of  a  smart  growth  revolution  that  allows  us  to  rethink  how 
we move people and goods. 
Fueling Up with Low Carbon Alternatives 

The combination of investments in improved vehicle efficiency and alternatives to 
continuing  historic  growth  in  travel  can  go  a  long  way  to  cutting  global  warming 
pollution from the transportation sector. However, if our economy continues to grow 
as  it  has  over  the  last  20  years,  these  solutions  will  not  be  enough  to  cut  global 
warming  pollution  from  transportation  by  at  least  80  percent  compared  to  levels  in 
2000. 

To reach those deep cuts while continuing to strengthen our economy, we must also 
tap  into  transportation  fuels  that  do  not  release  significant  amounts  of  carbon  diox-
ide.  If  we  combine  all  of  the  approaches  above  for  our  light-duty  cars  and  trucks, 
then by 2050 we will still need to supply the equivalent of 80 to 110 billion gallons 
of  gasoline  with  70–80  percent  less  global  warming  pollution  than  today’s  fuel.  For 
medium and heavy duty trucks, we will need the equivalent of another 30 to 40 bil-
lion  gallons  of  gasoline  with  75–80  percent  less  global  warming  pollution.  And  for 
the  remainder  of  the  transportation  sectors,  we  will  need  yet  another  40  to  50  bil-
lion gallons of low carbon fuel.

63 

That  means,  by  2050,  we  will  need  the  equivalent  of  150  to  200  billion  gallons  of 
gasoline with as much as an 80 percent reduction in global warming pollution com-
pared  to  today’s  gasoline.  And,  while  biofuels  will  play  an  important  part  in  a  low 
carbon future, it is unlikely, at best, that we can sustainably produce sufficient low- 
carbon biofuel in the U.S. A more realistic estimate of sustainable biofuel potential, 
one that minimizes tradeoffs between food and fuel and does not encourage deforest-
ation  in  other  countries,  would  be  closer  to  40  to  50  billion  gallons,  unless  break-
throughs are achieved in novel biomass resources. 

To supply the rest of transportation’s needed energy, we must to tap into renewable 
electricity  and  clean  hydrogen.  But  these  resources  will  not  appear  overnight,  nor 
will the vehicles that must be sold to use these low-carbon fuels. We will need mul-
tiple policies to bring about the needed fuel revolution: 

• A low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) must be put in place to cut global warming 
pollution by 10 percent by 2030 and up to 80 percent by 2050. While the recently 
passed Renewable Fuel Standard applies global warming pollution standards to 
biofuels, the required amount would only represent about 10 percent of current 
demand, leaving 90 percent of transportation fuel unregulated. 

• An ultra-low carbon fuel standard is also needed to accelerate demand for fuels 
that  dramatically  cut  global  warming  pollution.  While  a  10  percent  low  carbon 
fuel  standard  may  be  appropriate  for  2030,  it  will  mainly  put  a  stop  to  dirty 
fuels  such  as  liquid-coal  and  encourage  fuels  with  only  modest  improvements. 
To  created  demand  for  the  cleanest  biofuels,  electricity  and  hydrogen,  there 
should  be  a  carve-out  in  the  LCFS  for  a  minimum  volume  of  the  cleanest  fuels. 
• Vehicle  incentives  and  an  ultra-low  carbon  vehicle  requirement  will  also  be  es-
sential  to  ensure  that  the  vehicles  are  there  to  use  the  fuel.  Fuel  cell  vehicles, 
battery electric vehicles, and plug-ins are currently significantly more expensive 
than  conventional  vehicles  or  even  hybrids.  Economic  incentives  and  require-
ments will be needed to overcome the valley of death experienced by new tech-
nologies. 
Conclusion 

If  left  unchecked,  climate  change  will  have  direct  and  significant  impacts  on  our 
transportation  system.  But  that  same  system  can  be  an  essential  part  of  the  solu-
tion set to help avoid the worst impacts of climate change. 

The U.S. needs to move away from a piecemeal approach to transportation energy 
and environmental policy and instead adopt a comprehensive set of policies that will 
tap  into  both  the  near  term  and  long  term  solutions  that  are  available  or  on  the 
drawing  boards.  This  will  require  a  longer  term  perspective  and  a  combination  of 
consistent,  significant,  and  sustained  policies.  Yes,  we  do  need  to  rethink  our  trans-
portation system, but in doing so, we will not only dramatically lower global warm-
ing  pollution,  we  will  save  consumers  billions,  create  new  jobs  in  America  and  ulti-
mately cut our addiction to oil. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thank you very much. 
And now, Mr. Hamberger, welcome. 

STATEMENT  OF  EDWARD  R.  HAMBERGER,  PRESIDENT  AND 
CHIEF  EXECUTIVE  OFFICER,  ASSOCIATION  OF  AMERICAN 
RAILROADS 
Mr. HAMBERGER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Vice Chair-

man, Senator Stevens. 

The  Association  of  American  Railroads  appreciates  this  oppor-
tunity  to  address  the  issue  of  climate  change  and  transportation. 
At  the  outset,  I  would  suggest  that  one  area  where  everyone  can 
and should agree is that greater use of rail transportation, both for 
freight  and  for  passengers,  offers  a  simple,  cost-effective,  and  im-
mediate  way  to  meaningfully  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions 
without harming the economy. 

One way railroads positively impact the environment is by reduc-
ing fuel and energy consumption. Railroads, last year, were able to 
move a ton of freight an average of 436 miles on one gallon of fuel.

64 

It’s  like  moving  a  ton  of  freight  from  Boston  to  Baltimore  on  one 
gallon of fuel. 

Railroads  have  an  impressive  record  of  improving  their  fuel  effi-
ciency.  Since  1980,  our  fuel  efficiency  has  improved  by  85  percent. 
Last  year  alone,  freight  railroads  used  3.5  billion  fewer  gallons  of 
fuel than we would have without that improvement. And important 
for this hearing is that that improved fuel efficiency translates into 
substantial  reductions  in  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases.  In  fact, 
that  3.5-billion-gallon  savings  in  fuel  I’ve  just  referenced  means 
that railroads last year emitted 39 million fewer tons of carbon di-
oxide  than  they  would  have,  otherwise.  And  since  railroads  are 
three  or  more  times  as  fuel  efficient  as  trucks,  every  ton-mile  of 
freight that moves by rail instead of highways reduced greenhouse 
gas emissions by two-thirds or more. Shifting just 10 percent of the 
long-haul  freight  that  moves  by  truck  would  produce  an  annual 
fuel  savings  of  more  than  1  billion  gallons  of  fuel,  resulting  in  a 
reduction of annual greenhouse gas emissions of more than 12 mil-
lion tons. 

The  railroad  fuel  efficiency  advantage  helps  explain  why  freight 
railroads  account  for  just  2.6  percent  of  transportation-related 
greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  just  .7  percent  of  total  U.S.  green-
house gas emissions. 

Freight train emissions are also less for other types of pollutants. 
The  EPA  estimates  that  for  every  ton-mile,  a  typical  truck  emits 
three times more NOX and particulates than a locomotive. And just 
3  months  ago,  the  EPA  issued  stringent  new  locomotive  emission 
standard  guidelines  that  will  cut  particulate  matter  by  up  to  90 
percent and nitrogen oxide by up to 80 percent. 

Freight rail can also help reduce gridlock on America’s highways, 
saving commuters time, money, and fuel. A single freight train can 
take  hundreds  of  trucks  off  the  highways.  If  25  percent  of  freight 
volume  was  shifted  from  trucks  to  rail  by  2026,  commuters  could 
save  an  average  of  41  hours  a  year  in  commuting  time,  79  gallons 
of fuel, and $1,000 in total congestion costs. 

Now, just as expanded freight rail would be good for the environ-
ment, so would expanded passenger rail. The average intercity pas-
senger  train  produces  60  percent  lower  carbon  dioxide  emissions 
per passenger mile than the average automobile, and half as much 
as  an  airplane.  The  public  benefits  of  a  truly  attractive  and  com-
petitive national passenger rail capability will, indeed, exceed pub-
lic costs. 

The  AAR  was  pleased  to  support  passage  of  the  Amtrak  reau-
thorization  bills  in  both  the  House  and  the  Senate,  and  I  hope  a 
Conference Report can be passed yet this summer. 

At your hearing, 2 weeks ago, Mr. Chairman, you heard that the 
demand for freight in the U.S. will almost double over the next 25 
years.  And,  given  the  green  advantage  of  rail,  policymakers  would 
do well to encourage more of that freight to move over the Nation’s 
rail network. 

I  would  like  to  offer  three  policy  initiatives  that  would  aid  rail-

roads in expanding capacity to meet that demand. 

First,  enactment  of  the  Freight  Rail  Infrastructure  Capacity  Ex-
pansion  Act,  S.  1125,  which  provides  a  tax  credit  for  investments

in new rail capacity. That credit would be available not just to rail-
roads, but to any entity that invests in rail capacity expansion. 

Second, passage of the Short Line Rail Investment Act, which ex-
tends a targeted tax credit for smaller railroads that expired at the 
end of last year. 

Third, encouragement of public/private partnerships in which the 
public  pays  for  the  benefits  it  receives,  and  the  railroads  pay  for 
the  benefits  they  receive.  The  Chicago  Create  Project,  the  Heart-
land  Corridor,  and  the  Alameda  Corridor  are  all  examples  of  such 
projects  in  which  public  and  private  dollars  are  leveraged  together 
to  produce  public  benefits  both  for  capacity  for  passenger  rail,  as 
well as freight rail, that otherwise would not be realized. 

We look forward to working with the Members of this Committee 
in  developing  programs  that  will  help  our  Nation  address  climate 
change issues and continue to move passengers and freight by rail. 

Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Hamberger follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF EDWARD R. HAMBERGER, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF 

EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN RAILROADS 

The  Association  of  American  Railroads  (AAR)  appreciates  the  opportunity  to  ad-
dress the issue of climate change and transportation. AAR members account for the 
vast  majority  of  freight  railroad  mileage,  employees,  and  traffic  in  Canada,  Mexico, 
and the United States. 

Few  topics  today  generate  as  much  debate  as  climate  change.  I  respectfully  sug-
gest,  however,  that  one  area  where  everyone  can  and  should  agree  is  that  greater 
use  of  rail  transportation  offers  a  simple,  cost-effective,  and  immediate  way  to 
meaningfully  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  without  potentially  harming  the 
economy. 

Given this fact, I also respectfully suggest that policymakers should take steps to 
attract  more  freight  and  passengers  to  railroads  and  expand  the  substantial  green-
house  gas  and  other  public  benefits  of  rail  transportation—for  example,  by  imple-
menting an investment tax credit for rail infrastructure capacity expansion projects; 
by  encouraging  greater  use  of  rail-related  public-private  partnerships;  and  by  ade-
quately  funding  Amtrak  to  allow  it  to  bring  the  Northeast  Corridor  to  a  state  of 
good  repair,  procure  new  rolling  stock,  and  make  additional  capital  improvements 
and maintenance over its network. 

Freight  and  passenger  railroads  have  a  strong  record  of  success  in  meeting  our 
Nation’s transportation needs in an environmentally-friendly fashion. They are com-
mitted  to  pursuing  further  technological  and  operational  advancements  that  will 
lead to continued tangible improvements in fuel efficiency, mobility, greenhouse gas 
emissions, and air quality. 
Railroads Are the Most Fuel-Efficient Form of Surface Freight Transport 

According  to  EPA  data,  in  2006  total  U.S.  greenhouse  gas  emissions  were  7,054 
teragrams 1 of carbon dioxide equivalents, with transportation accounting for 28 per-
cent  of  the  total.  The  vast  majority  of  transportation-related  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions  are  directly  correlated  with  fossil  fuel  consumption:  the  higher  the  fuel  con-
sumption, the greater the greenhouse gas emissions. 

1 A teragram is a million metric tons or 1.1 million short tons.

Freight  railroads,  though,  are  the  most  fuel  efficient  mode  of  surface  transpor-
tation. In 2007, railroads moved one ton of freight an average of 436 miles per gal-
lon  of  fuel—roughly  the  distance  from  one  end  of  Nebraska  to  the  other,  or  from 
Boston to Baltimore. 

Indeed, on a ton-miles 2 per gallon of fuel basis, freight railroads are three or more 
times  more  fuel  efficient  than  trucks.  That  means  that  every  ton-mile  of  freight  that 
moves  by  rail  instead  of  truck  reduces  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  two  thirds  or 
more. 

The railroad fuel efficiency advantage helps explain why freight railroads account 
for  just  2.6  percent  of  transportation-related  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  just  0.7 
percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to the EPA. 

2 A  ton-mile  is  the  movement  of  one  ton  of  freight  one-mile.  It  is  a  standard  way  to  measure 

freight volume across transportation modes.

Moving More Freight By Rail is in the Public Interest 

Trucks  are,  and  will  continue  to  be,  critical  to  freight  transportation  and  to  our 
economy.  But  based  on  data  from  a  study  by  the  American  Association  of  State 
Highway  and  Transportation  Officials  (AASHTO),  for  each  1  percent  of  long-haul 
freight moved by rail instead of by truck, fuel savings would be around 110 million 
gallons per year and annual greenhouse gas emissions would fall by around 1.2 mil-
lion  tons.  If  10  percent  of  long-haul  freight  now  moving  by  truck  moved  by  rail  in-
stead,  annual  fuel  savings  would  exceed  one  billion  gallons  and  annual  greenhouse 
gas emissions would fall by more than 12 million tons. 

Moreover,  because  freight  transportation  demand  is  expected  to  rise  sharply  in 
the  years  ahead,  future  fuel  savings—and  greenhouse  gas  reductions—would  be 
much  higher  if  more  freight  moved  by  rail.  AASHTO  projects  that  ton-miles  for 
truck  movements  more  than  500  miles  long  will  increase  from  1.40  trillion  in  2000 
to  2.13  trillion  in  2020.  If  10  percent  of  these  long-haul  truck  movements  went  by 
rail  (perhaps  via  efficient  intermodal  movements  involving  both  railroads  and 
trucks),  cumulative  greenhouse  gas  reductions  from  2007  to  2020  would  be  around 
200 million tons. 

The public benefits of freight rail do not stop there, however. Moving more freight 
by  rail  would  also  help  reduce  highway  congestion,  which  costs  $78  billion  just  in 
wasted travel time (4.2 billion hours) and wasted fuel (2.9 billion gallons) each year, 
according to the Texas Transportation Institute’s 2007 Urban Mobility Report. (The 
total  costs  of  congestion  are  far  higher  if  lost  productivity,  costs  associated  with 
cargo  delays,  and  other  items  are  included.)  A  typical  train,  though,  takes  the

freight  equivalent  of  several  hundred  trucks  off  our  congested  highways,  thus  en-
hancing  mobility  and  reducing  the  amount  of  greenhouse  gases  emitted  by  motor 
vehicles  stuck  or  slowed  in  traffic.  Railroads  also  reduce  the  costs  of  maintaining 
existing roads and reduce the pressure to build costly new roads, freeing up limited 
funds for other purposes. 

Finally,  railroads  also  release  far  less  of  other  types  of  emissions  than  other 
modes of transport. The EPA estimates that for every ton-mile, a typical truck emits 
roughly three times more nitrogen oxides and particulates than a locomotive. Other 
studies  suggest  an  even  greater  advantage  for  railroads.  In  March  2008,  the  EPA 
issued stringent new locomotive emissions guidelines that, when fully implemented, 
will  cut  particulate  matter  emissions  by  locomotives  by  as  much  as  90  percent  and 
nitrogen  oxide  (NOX)  emissions  by  as  much  as  80  percent  compared  to  locomotives 
meeting the most stringent standards set in 1998. The new standards will also yield 
sizable  reductions  in  emissions  of  hydrocarbons,  carbon  monoxide,  and  other  air 
toxics. 

Railroads  Are  Constantly  Working  to  Improve  Fuel  Efficiency  and  Reduce 

Greenhouse Gas Emissions Even More 

In  1980,  one  gallon  of  diesel  fuel  moved  one  ton  of  freight  by  rail  an  average  of 
235  miles.  As  noted  earlier,  by  2007  railroads  moved  one  ton  of  freight  an  average 
of  436  miles  per  gallon  of  fuel.  Thanks  to  this  improvement  in  fuel  efficiency,  in 
2007 alone Class I freight railroads used 3.5 billion fewer gallons of fuel—and emit-
ted  nearly  39  million  fewer  tons  of  carbon  dioxide—than  they  would  have  if  their 
fuel  efficiency  had  remained  constant  since  1980.  From  1980  through  2007,  U.S. 
freight  railroads  consumed  48  billion  fewer  gallons  of  fuel  and  emitted  538  million 
fewer  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  than  they  would  have  if  their  fuel  efficiency  had  not 
improved.3 

3 Today,  U.S.  freight  railroads  today  consume  approximately  4.4  billion  gallons  of  diesel  fuel 

per year.

Railroads  are  investing  heavily  in  ‘‘cleaner  and  greener’’  technologies  and  other 

efforts to further improve their fuel efficiency. Just a few examples include: 

• New  locomotives.  Railroads  have  spent  billions  of  dollars  in  recent  years  on 
thousands  of  new,  more  environmentally-friendly  locomotives.  They  have  also 
overhauled  thousands  of  older  locomotives  to  improve  their  environmental  per-
formance. 
Some  of  the  new  locomotives  are  fuel-saving  ‘‘generator  set’’  (genset)  units  for 
use  in  rail  yards.  Gensets  have  two  or  three  independent  engines  that  cycle  on 
and  off  depending  on  need,  sharply  reducing  fuel  consumption,  pollution,  and 
noise compared to the locomotives they replace. Other switching locomotives are 
hybrids  with  a  small  fossil-fueled  engine  in  addition  to  a  bank  of  rechargeable 
batteries. Research is ongoing on hybrid long-haul locomotives that would store 
in  batteries  the  energy  generated  by  braking,  and  in  hydrogen  fuel  cell  switch-
ing locomotives. 
• Train  handling.  In  part,  railroad  fuel  efficiency  depends  on  how  well  an  engi-
neer  handles  a  train.  That’s  why  railroads  use  the  skills  of  their  engineers  to 
save  fuel.  For  example,  many  railroads  offer  training  programs  through  which 
engineers and simulators provide fuel-saving tips. On some major railroads, the 
fuel  consumption  performance  of  participating  engineers  is  compared,  with 
awards given to the top ‘‘fuel masters.’’ 
In  addition,  railroads  are  using  sophisticated  on-board  monitoring  systems  to 
gather and evaluate information on location, topography, track curvature, train 
length  and  weight,  and  more  to  provide  engineers  with  real-time  ‘‘coaching’’  on 
the best speed for that train from a fuel-savings standpoint. 
• Information  technology.  Many  railroads  use  advanced  computer  software  to  im-
prove  their  fuel  efficiency.  For  example,  sophisticated  modeling  tools  identify 
the  best  way  to  sequence  cars  in  a  large  classification  yard.  Railroads  also  use 
innovative  ‘‘trip  planning’’  systems  that  automatically  analyze  crew  and  loco-
motive availability, track congestion, the priority of different freight cars, track 
conditions,  and  other  variables  to  optimize  how  and  when  freight  cars  are  as-
sembled  to  form  trains  and  when  those  trains  depart.  The  result  is  smoother 
traffic flow, better asset utilization, and reduced fuel use. 
• Idle reduction technology. Locomotives often have to idle when not in use to pre-
vent  freezing,  provide  for  crew  comfort,  or  for  other  reasons.  However,  many 
railroads  have  installed  idle-reduction  technology  that  allows  main  engines  to 
shut  down  under  certain  conditions.  One  advantage  of  genset  locomotives  is 
that  their  smaller  engines  use  antifreeze,  allowing  them  to  shut  down  in  cold 
weather. Railroads also use ‘‘auxiliary power units’’ to warm engines so that lo-
comotives can be shut down in cold weather. 
• Components, maintenance, and design. Railroads use innovative freight car and 
locomotive  components,  maintenance  programs,  and  designs  to  save  fuel.  For 
example, advanced lubrication techniques save fuel by reducing friction; the use 
of  low  torque  bearings  on  freight  cars  and  improving  the  aerodynamic  profile 
of  trains  save  fuel  by  reducing  drag;  and  the  use  of  ‘‘distributed  power’’  (loco-
motives  placed  in  the  middle  of  trains)  can,  in  certain  applications,  save  fuel 
by improving operational efficiency. 

The  seven  largest  U.S.  freight  railroads  have  all  joined  EPA’s  ‘‘SmartWay  Trans-
port,’’ a voluntary partnership between freight transporters and the EPA that estab-
lishes  incentives  for  fuel  efficiency  improvements  and  greenhouse  gas  reductions. 
The initiative is designed to reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by 36 to 73 mil-
lion  tons  and  nitrogen  oxide  (NOX)  emissions  by  up  to  220,000  tons.  As  part  of  the 
partnership,  each  railroad  has  committed  to  evaluating  the  environmental  impacts 
of its operations and agreed to work with the EPA to develop and implement plans 
to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions in coming years. 
What Can Policymakers Do Regarding Freight Rail? 

Using  freight  railroads  more  means  consuming  fuel  less,  and  that’s  important 

today more than ever. 

Serious  capacity  issues,  however,  threaten  the  ability  of  railroads  to  handle  so-
cially-optimal  amounts  of  traffic.  Freight  railroads  are  reinvesting  record  amounts 
of their own funds into their systems, but that will not be enough to take full advan-
tage of railroads’ potential to meet our transportation needs. That’s why we respect-
fully  urge  you  to  support  a  tax  credit  for  projects  that  expand  freight  rail  capacity. 
This  would  help  bridge  the  funding  gap,  producing  public  benefits  (like  reduced 
greenhouse gas emissions, reduced highway gridlock, and cleaner air) that would far 
exceed the cost of the credit.

S.  1125  (the  ‘‘Freight  Rail  Infrastructure  Capacity  Expansion  Act  of  2007’’)  calls 
for  a  25  percent  tax  credit  for  investments  in  freight  rail  infrastructure  expansion 
projects.  The  AAR  gratefully  acknowledges  the  support  members  of  this  committee 
have  shown  toward  S.  1125,  and  congratulates  them  on  recognizing  that  a  rail  in-
vestment  tax  credit  addresses  the  central  challenge  of  how  to  move  more  freight 
without causing more highway gridlock or environmental degradation. 

I  also  respectfully  urge  you  to  support  S.  881,  the  ‘‘Short  Line  Railroad  Invest-
ment Act of 2007,’’ which would extend the ‘‘Section 45G’’ tax credit for investments 
in  short  line  track  rehabilitation  that  expired  in  2007.  The  Section  45G  tax  credit 
has  helped  hundreds  of  short  line  railroads  increase  the  volume  and  rate  of  track 
rehabilitation  and  improvement  programs,  which  in  turn  allows  them  to  offer  more 
efficient,  cost-effective,  and  environmentally-friendly  rail  service  to  communities 
throughout the country. 

Finally, the immense public benefits of freight railroading—including lower green-
house  gas  emissions  and  less  congested  roads  and  highways—would  accrue  more 
quickly  if  more  public-private  partnerships  for  freight  railroad  infrastructure 
projects  were  implemented.  Partnerships  are  not  ‘‘subsidies’’  to  railroads.  Rather, 
they  are  an  acknowledgement  that  private  entities  should  pay  for  private  benefits 
and  public  entities  should  pay  for  public  benefits.  Partnerships  reflect  the  fact  that 
cooperation between interested entities is far more likely to result in timely, mean-
ingful solutions to transportation problems than a go-it-alone approach. 
Climate Change and Passenger Rail 

As discussed above, if our goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and highway 
congestion, transportation policy should emphasize modes of transportation that re-
duce  fuel  consumption  and  take  motor  vehicles  off  our  congested  highways.  Rail-
roads  offer  a  fuel  efficient,  carbon-friendly  transportation  option  for  people  as  well 
as freight. 

In its January 2008 final report to Congress, the National Surface Transportation 
Policy  and  Revenue  Study  Commission  stated  that  ‘‘intercity  passenger  rail  is  . . . 
more  energy  efficient  than  many  other  modes  of  passenger  transportation.’’  The  re-
port states that the average intercity passenger rail train produces 60 percent lower 
carbon  dioxide  emissions  per  passenger-mile  than  the  average  automobile,  and  half 
the carbon dioxide emissions per passenger-mile of an airplane. 

BNSF CEO Matt Rose was a member of that Commission. In the final report, Mr. 
Rose  stated  that  he  ‘‘shared  the  conclusion  of  the  Commission’s  report  that  pas-
senger rail—intercity and commuter—will need to grow in order to supplant [vehicle 
miles  traveled]  and  give  Americans  more  affordable,  sustainable  choices  in  light  of 
higher  fuel  prices,  growing  transportation  congestion  and  related  environmental 
concerns.’’ 

Mr.  Rose,  like  so  many  others,  realizes  that  there  are  substantial  public  benefits 
from  comprehensive  intercity  passenger  rail.  Indeed,  the  public  benefits  of  a  truly 
attractive and competitive national passenger rail capability will exceed public costs. 
But  in  order  to  be  a  true  transportation  alternative  for  Americans,  passenger  rail, 
like freight rail, cannot be achieved on the cheap. 

That’s  why  expanding  the  capacity  of  our  Nation’s  rail  infrastructure  is  a  critical 
challenge  that  policymakers  should  address,  especially  as  rising  fuel  prices  are 
bringing  ever-more  passengers  to  railroads.  Amtrak  ridership  may  reach  28  million 
this  year—the  highest  it  has  ever  been  and  up  from  25.8  million  passengers  last 
year. In fact, Amtrak ridership and revenues are up in all categories: short distance, 
long  distance,  and  Northeast  Corridor  services  are  all  experiencing  significant 
growth.  Last  month,  Amtrak  had  the  highest  revenue  and  ridership  of  any  month 
in history. Fiscal year 2008 year-to-date ridership is up 11 percent and revenues are 
up 14 percent over the comparable period in Fiscal Year 2007. 

Indeed,  as  the  cost  of  auto  and  air  travel  continue  to  increase  and  the  prospect 
of  a  carbon-constrained  future  increases,  we  have  an  opportunity—and  the  need— 
to  make  far  more  concerted  efforts  than  we  have  in  the  past  to  more  fully  capture 
the  economic,  environmental,  and  social  benefits  of  reliable,  convenient,  and  com-
prehensive passenger rail service. 

Unfortunately,  without  significant  investment  in  capacity  expansion—both  infra-
structure  and  equipment—Amtrak  will  not  be  able  to  handle  all  the  people  that 
want to use it and we will fail to capture all of those benefits. 

For  example,  Amtrak’s  locomotive  fleet  is  antiquated:  its  diesel  switcher  loco-
motive fleet is 40 years old; the average age of the AEM–7 electric fleet is 25 years, 
and  its  overhead  electric  catenary  system  in  the  Northeast  Corridor  is  1930s  tech-
nology  that  does  not  allow  Amtrak  to  take  advantage  of  the  improved  efficiency  of 
modern  converter,  transformer,  and  transmission  designs.  Passenger  cars  could  be

71 

made  lighter  and  more  aerodynamic.  These  are  all  areas  worthy  of  government  in-
vestment that will pay huge dividends over the long term. 

Moreover,  the  implementation  of  high-speed  rail  corridors,  if  done  in  ways  that 
minimize  the  substantial  operational,  engineering,  legal,  and  other  impediments 
that  often  hinder  the  ability  of  freight  railroads  to  accommodate  passenger  trains, 
would  go  a  long  way  in  providing  a  realistic  alternative  to  short-distance  air  travel 
and  driving  for  millions  of  trips  per  year  while  significantly  reducing  the  carbon 
footprint associated with that travel. 

In  the  meantime,  Amtrak  is  committed  to  working  to  improve  efficiency  and  re-
ducing greenhouse gas emissions. For example, Amtrak is partnering with the state 
of Oklahoma on a pilot project to test the use of biofuels in Amtrak locomotives. Am-
trak has been approached by another state about a pilot project testing new battery 
technology  in  locomotives.  Amtrak  has  long  been  an  industry  leader  in  environ-
mental initiatives as a charter member of the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) and 
the  first  railroad  in  CCX,  North  America’s  first  greenhouse  gas  emissions  trading 
market. Amtrak has already committed to the largest voluntary emissions reduction 
plan  for  diesel  fuel  use  in  the  United  States.  In  addition,  Amtrak  passengers  can 
now purchase carbon offsets for their rail trip with Internet ticket purchases. 
Conclusion 

The  key  to  reducing  transportation-related  greenhouse  gas  emissions  is  reducing 
fuel  consumption  in  transportation.  America’s  freight  and  passenger  railroads  offer 
a  simple,  cost-  effective  and  meaningful  way  to  help  do  this,  thereby  helping  to  en-
sure a sustainable future for our planet. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thank you very much. 
Mr. MEENAN. You’re the next witness, please. Go ahead. 

STATEMENT OF JOHN M. MEENAN, EXECUTIVE VICE 

PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, 

AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA, INC. 

Mr.  MEENAN.  Thank  you.  Today  I  wanted  to  focus  my  remarks 
on  the  commercial  airlines’  outstanding  record  of  greenhouse  gas 
efficiency,  our  proactive  commitment  to  further  limiting  our  emis-
sions  footprint,  and  the  complementary  role  that  Congress  can 
play. 

However, I would also note the crippling fuel price crisis the air-
lines are enduring, which inextricably linked to the broader energy 
transportation  and  climate  change  policies  underpinning  today’s 
hearing. 

We seek your help in ensuring policies that will alleviate this cri-
sis  and  allow  us  to  get  on  with  our  business.  A  vibrant,  competi-
tive,  and  growing  aviation  sector  is  a  key  part  of  climate—the  cli-
mate change solution. 

Commercial aviation in the United States has a decidedly strong 
track record, which is often overlooked or misstated. We contribute 
just  2  percent  of  domestic  greenhouse  gases,  compared  to  25  per-
cent for the balance of the transportation industry. This is no small 
achievement,  given  that  commercial  aviation  is  essential  to  our 
economy and supports nearly 9 percent of U.S. employment. 

Today’s  airplanes  are  not  just  smarter,  they’re  quieter,  cleaner, 
and  use  less  fuel  than  ever  before,  because  we  fly  them  smarter. 
U.S.  airlines  have  been  able  to  deliver  more  value  by  constantly 
improving  fuel  efficiency  through  reinvestment  in  technology  and 
more  efficient  operations.  And,  in  fact,  we  improved  our  fuel  effi-
ciency  by  110  percent  between  1978  and  2007,  resulting  in  2.5  bil-
lion  metric  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  savings,  roughly  the  equivalent 
of taking 18.7 million cars off the road in those years. U.S. carriers 
burned almost 3 percent less fuel in 2007 than in 2000, but carried 
20 percent more passengers and cargo on a revenue/ton-mile basis.

Today, our planes are as fuel efficient as compact cars, but carry 
more  goods  and  people  over  six  times  faster,  and  our  jets  are  five 
to six times more fuel efficient than corporate jets. 

The  Air  Transport  Association  carriers  are  highly  motivated  to 
continue  this  trend,  and  have  made  a  commitment  to  improve  fuel 
efficiency  by  an  additional  30  percent  by  2025.  Moreover,  recog-
nizing  that  today’s  carbon-based  fuel  supply  can  only  take  us  so 
far,  ATA  and  its  airlines  are  making  extensive  resource  commit-
ments  to  stimulate  the  development  of  commercially  viable,  envi-
ronmentally  friendly  alternative  fuels  through  the  Commercial 
Aviation  Alternative  Fuels  Initiative.  Congress  can  take  action  to 
complement  our  efforts  by  ensuring  that  our  Nation’s  outdated  air 
traffic  control  system  is  modernized  to  permit  more  direct  routes, 
serving an—saving an additional 10 to 15 percent in fuel and emis-
sions. 

Further, we urge Congress to reinvigorate NASA’s and the FAA’s 
Environmental  Aeronautics  Research  and  Development  Programs 
with specific respect to mitigating the impacts of climate change on 
aviation. Congress can support data-driven transportation planning 
that  includes  airlines,  FAA,  the  airports,  and  State  and  local  gov-
ernments. 

Finally,  and  most  time  critical,  we  urge  Congress  to  act  now  to 
address  the  fuel  price  crisis.  Even  before  the  recent  sustained  fuel 
price  spikes,  fuel  was  the  airline’s  largest  cost  center.  Fuel  prices 
now  average  30  to  50  percent  of  an  airline’s  operating  expenses, 
costing between $41 billion in 2007, projected to grow to $61 billion 
this year. I think it’s fair to say that the market has long sent a— 
the  commercial  airlines  the  price  signal,  which  some  now  want  to 
pile  onto  with  cap-and-trade  and  further  limits  to  the  industry’s 
ability to reinvest. 

Unfortunately,  the  last  several  months,  that  price  signal  has 
turned into a fuel price crisis of epic proportions. This country’s air-
lines  expect  to  lose  in  the  range  of  $10  billion  this  year,  a  loss  on 
par with that of the worst year in the industry’s history. High fuel 
prices are the sole reason for this situation. 

Unlike  the  temporary  revenue  hits  of  9/11  and  other  time-de-
mand shocks, the airlines are now facing a massive structural cost 
increase. 

Let  me  try  to  add  some  context.  More  than  14,000  airline  jobs 
have been cut so far this year, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg. 
Scores  of  communities  stand  to  lose  all  scheduled  air  service  by 
early next year. More airlines, in addition to the nine that have al-
ready  filed  for  bankruptcy  or  stopped  operating,  will  simply  shut 
down. 

So,  why  should  this  Committee  care  that  the  airlines  are  on  the 
brink of financial disaster—some would say, about to implode? The 
answer  is  simple.  The  Nation’s  economy  is  intrinsically  linked  to 
the  viability  of  the  air  transportation  system.  If  the  airlines  con-
tinue to spiral downward, so will the economy. Aviation contributes 
$690  billion  to  the  U.S.  gross  domestic  product.  That’s  10  million 
new jobs. 

So,  I  take  this  opportunity  at  this  hearing  to  ask  you  again  to 
work  with  us  to  address  this  crisis.  And  I’d  be  happy  to  respond 
to your questions.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Meenan follows:] 
PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN M. MEENAN, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND 

CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA, INC. 

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Air  Transport  Association  (ATA)  airline  members 
transport more than 90 percent of all U.S. airline passenger and cargo traffic.1 Our 
airlines  take  their  role  in  controlling  emissions  very  seriously.  Recently,  there  has 
been  a  great  deal  of  focus  in  Congress  on  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  in  par-
ticular,  and  how  this  Nation  might  achieve  reductions  in  these  emissions  while 
maintaining  economic  stability  and  enhancing  energy  independence.  Commercial 
aviation  has  a  vital  role  to  play  in  this  regard.  Also,  as  strong  supporters  of  sound 
transportation  planning,  the  airlines  appreciate  the  Committee’s  interest  in  the  po-
tential impacts on transportation that might result from changes in climate. Thank 
you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss these issues. 
Introduction and Overview 

For generations, flying has contributed to a better quality of life in America. Com-
mercial  aviation  has  been  essential  to  the  growth  of  our  economy,  yielded  break-
through  technologies,  brought  people  together  and  transported  critical  cargo—all 
while  achieving  an  exceptional  environmental  track  record.  Today’s  airplanes  are 
not  just  smarter—they  are  quieter,  cleaner  and  use  less  fuel  than  ever  before—but 
we  also  fly  them  smarter.  That’s  why  our  industry  represents  just  2  percent  of  all 
GHG emissions in the United States while driving three times more economic activ-
ity.  But  we  are  not  stopping  there.  The  initiatives  that  we  are  undertaking  to  fur-
ther  address  GHG  emissions  are  designed  to  responsibly  and  effectively  limit  our 
fuel consumption, GHG contribution and potential climate change impacts while al-
lowing  commercial  aviation  to  continue  to  serve  as  a  key  contributor  to  the  U.S. 
economy.  I  want  to  emphasize  three  points  that  are  essential  to  moving  our  emis-
sions-reducing efforts forward within a framework of sound transportation planning, 
energy and climate change policy: 

First, commercial airlines are and have long been extremely GHG efficient. For the 
past  several  decades,  commercial  airlines  have  dramatically  improved  GHG  effi-
ciency  by  investing  billions  in  fuel-saving  aircraft  and  engines  and  innovative  tech-
nologies like winglets and cutting-edge route optimization software. Fuel is our larg-
est cost center, which, long before the current fuel price crisis created the economic 
imperative  that  we  continuously  improve  fuel  and  GHG  efficiency.  And  while  com-
mercial aviation accounts for only 2 percent of domestic man-made GHG emissions, 
we  shepherd  this  to  good  use,  driving  a  far  larger  percentage  of  economic  activity, 
not only directly, but also indirectly, as a necessary element in the airport and tour-
ism  sectors  and  in  all  business  sectors  that  rely  on  the  rapid  delivery  of  goods  and 
human resources. 

Second, ATA airlines are proactively committed to further limiting their GHG foot-
print  through  a  set  of  measures  that  will  simultaneously  address  climate  change 
and  energy  independence  while  preserving  economic  stability  and  the  opportunity 
to grow. At the core of these measures is the ATA carriers’ commitment to an addi-
tional  30  percent  fuel  efficiency  improvement  by  2025—improvement  that  only 
comes from the airlines’ investment in new aircraft, new aircraft engines, navigation 
aids  and  enhanced  operational  procedures.  In  addition,  we  are  dedicating  ourselves 
to  developing  commercially  viable,  environmentally  friendly  alternative  jet  fuel, 
which  could  be  a  game-changer  in  terms  of  aviation’s  output  of  GHGs.  Moreover, 
we are central stakeholders in partnering efforts to modernize the outdated air traf-
fic  management  (ATM)  system  and  to  reinvigorate  research  and  development  in 
aviation  environmental  technology,  both  of  which  can  bring  extensive  additional 
emissions reductions. 

Third,  there  is  a  critical  role  for  the  Federal  Government  to  play  in  energy,  trans-
portation  planning  and  climate  change  policy  to  complement  the  airlines’  efforts. 
While  the  ATA  airlines’  30  percent  fuel  efficiency  improvement  target  will  be  met 
through the airlines’ own investments and operating initiatives, the other measures 
in  the  package  require  a  significant  measure  of  congressional  support.  Also,  sound 
transportation  planning  at  all  levels  of  government  can  help  minimize  the  impacts 
on transportation from potential climate change effects.

Just  as  we  ask  Congress  to  continue  to  work  with  us,  we  also  urge  Congress  to 
calibrate  Federal  energy  and  transportation  policy  and  any  climate  change-related 
legislation  so  they  do  not  work  against  our  efforts.  Last  week,  ATA  announced  a 
revised 2008 forecast: the U.S. airlines expect to lose in the range of $10 billion this 
year—a  loss  on  par  with  the  worst  year  in  this  industry’s  history.  Soaring  fuel 
prices are the sole reason. Congress must help get these prices under control. More-
over, while the Senate recently declined to go forward with the GHG cap-and-trade 
program  proposed  in  the  Lieberman-Warner  Climate  Security  Act,  which  would 
have  applied  an  additional  fuel  surcharge  on  airlines’  jet  fuel,  we  understand  that 
many  in  Congress  still  are  interested  in  applying  such  proposals  to  aviation.  Not 
only  is  an  additional  ‘‘price  signal’’  unnecessary  for  our  industry,  but  recent  events 
have shown the crippling effects that exorbitant fuel prices can have. We urge Con-
gress  to  adopt  sound  energy,  transportation  planning  and  climate  change  policies 
that  avoid  counterproductive,  punitive  approaches  that  further  siphon  away  funds 
that the airlines otherwise could use to invest in newer aircraft and other fuel- and 
GHG-saving measures. 
Commercial Aviation Is Extremely GHG Efficient 

Commercial aviation in the United States has a decidedly strong track record that 
is often overlooked or misstated. U.S. commercial aviation contributes just 2 percent 
of domestic U.S. GHG emissions.2 To put that into context, with passenger vehicles 
(cars  and  light  duty  trucks)  alone  accounting  for  over  17.5  percent,3 as  illustrated 
in Figure 1, road transport accounts for more than a quarter of U.S. GHG emissions 
and  power  plants  account  for  over  a  third.4 The  picture  is  similar  when  viewed  on 
a  global  basis.  Worldwide  commercial  aviation  contributes  just  3  percent  of  man- 
made GHGs.5 To put this into perspective, cattle and other livestock account for ap-
proximately 18 percent.6 
Figure 1—U.S. Aviation Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
2 Percent of the Inventory 

Source: U.S. EPA Data 2005 
At  the  same  time,  commercial  aviation  is  critically  important  to  local,  national 
and  global  economies,  enabling  a  large  percentage  of  U.S.  economic  output.  A  July 

2 The United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) most recent general inventory 
reports commercial aviation’s contribution to the total GHG emissions in 2006 was 2.04 percent.

EPA  GHG  Inventory  1990–2006)  at  pages  ES–4  and  21  (‘‘in  2006,  total  U.S.  greenhouse  gas 
emissions  were  7,054.2’’  teragrams  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  (Tg  CO2 Eq))  and  Table  2–15 
at pp. 2–22 & 2–23 (‘‘Commercial Aircraft—Domestic’’ account for 143.6 Tg. CO2 Eq.).

nomic  activity.  See  International  Air  Transport  Association,  Debunking  Some  Persistent  Myths

2007  study  by  the  FAA  found  that  the  national  economy  is  highly  dependent  on 
commercial  aviation,  which  is  directly  or  indirectly  responsible  for  5.2  percent  of 
U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), $1.1 trillion in U.S. economic activity (gross out-
put),  an  estimated  9.5  million  jobs,  and  $322  billion  in  earnings.7 Placing  our  eco-
nomic output side-by-side with our GHG output, it is clear that commercial aviation 
is  an  extremely  GHG-efficient  economic  engine,  bringing  good  ‘‘bang’’  for  our  GHG 
‘‘buck.’’ 

We  have  been  able  to  deliver  such  strong  economic  output  while  reducing  our 
emissions by continually improving our fuel efficiency through reinvestment in tech-
nology  and  more  fuel-efficient  operations.  In  fact,  U.S.  commercial  airlines  (pas-
senger  and  cargo  combined)  improved  their  fuel  efficiency  by  110  percent  between 
1978  and  2007,  which  (given  the  one-to-one  relationship  between  fuel  consumption 
and  carbon  dioxide  (CO2))  has  resulted  in  2.5  billion  metric  tons  of  CO2 savings— 
roughly equivalent to taking 18.7 million cars off the road each of those years. Fur-
ther, Bureau of Transportation Statistics data confirm that U.S. carriers burned al-
most 3 percent less fuel in 2007 than they did in 2000, resulting in absolute reduc-
tions  in  GHG  emissions,  even  though  they  carried  20  percent  more  passengers  and 
cargo on a revenue ton miles basis. 

Commercial aviation’s GHG efficiency compares very favorably to other modes and 
other  sectors.  While  commercial  aviation  improved  its  per-passenger  fuel  efficiency 
from  1990,  freight  trucks  showed  the  reverse  trend,  with  GHG  emissions  growing 
faster than vehicle miles traveled.8 EPA also has confirmed that passenger vehicles 
have  lagged  far  behind  aircraft  in  fuel  and  GHG  efficiency.9 (See  Figure  2).  Within 
the  aviation  sector,  it  is  important  to  remember  that  different  types  of  commercial 
aircraft  have  vastly  different  impacts  on  the  environment.  Commercial  jets  are  five 
to six times more fuel efficient than corporate jets. The math is simple: carrying 200 
people  and  cargo  across  the  country  in  a  single  plane  burns  a  lot  less  fuel  than  33 
separate corporate jets, each flying six people. 
Figure  2—In  Contrast  to  Personal  Vehicles,  Airline  Fuel  Efficiency  Has 

Improved Substantially Since 1990 

U.S. airlines are highly motivated to continue this trend. Fuel, long one of the two 
highest  costs  for  airlines,  is  now  our  largest  cost  center,  averaging  between  30  and 
50  percent  of  total  operating  expenses.  In  fact,  jet  fuel  costs  to  the  U.S.  airlines  in 
2008  are  projected  to  be  $62  billion  or  more,  breaking  the  2007  record  of  $41.2  bil-
lion,  resulting  in  what  some  analysts  are  likening  to  the  economic  effects  of  the 
9/11 terrorist attacks.10 As shown in Figure 3, the price change alone between 2004 
and  year-end  2008  is  the  equivalent  of  267,000  airline  jobs  or  the  purchase  price 
of 286 new narrow-body jets.

And  contrary  to  popular  belief,  the  airlines  cannot  pass  on  significant  portions  of 
these costs. Indeed, as illustrated in Figure 4, today’s U.S. domestic air fares remain 
below  2000  levels,  although  fuel  prices  have  tripled.  While  a  slightly  more  robust 
international  aviation  market  has  allowed  today’s  systemwide  fares  to  increase  ap-
proximately 3 percent above 2000 levels, this hardly makes up for the three-fold in-
crease  in  fuel  prices  over  the  same  period.  Thus,  we  have  an  unrelenting  economic 
imperative to reduce fuel consumption.

In  light  of  the  current  and  sustained  fuel  price  crisis,  the  U.S.  airlines  are  being 
forced  to  put  down  capacity  for  air  services.  Should  we  be  able  to  get  fuel  prices

down to more reasonable levels and turn the economy around, we would hope to see 
a return to growth in U.S. air passenger and cargo services. Under such a scenario, 
some growth in aviation emissions is predicted. However, this growth must be kept 
in  context.  The  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC),  which  is  con-
sidered  the  authority  on  this  issue,  has  determined  that  under  the  most  likely  sce-
nario, CO2 from global aviation in 2050 will account for only about 3 percent of total 
man-made  CO2 emissions  and  that  aviation’s  overall  GHG  impact  will  be  around  5 
percent.11 Yet even though those remain relatively small numbers, ATA carriers are 
relentlessly pursuing measures to further limit their emissions footprint. 
Figure  5—ATA’s  30  Percent  Fuel  Efficiency  Goal  Will  Translate  into  CO2 

Savings 

At  the  core  of  our  efforts,  ATA  carriers  have  made  a  commitment  to  achieve  an 
additional  30  percent  systemwide  fuel  efficiency  improvement  through  2025,  on  top 
of  prior  improvements.  That  equates  to  an  additional  1.2  billion  metric  tons  of  CO2 
saved—roughly equivalent to taking over 13 million cars off the road each year. (See 
Figure  5).  To  accomplish  this,  our  airlines  plan  to  continue  the  tremendous  invest-
ments in new equipment and in operational innovations that have allowed us to at-
tain  such  great  fuel  efficiency  improvements  in  the  past.  We  are  leaving  no  stone 
unturned. Some examples of our efforts include: 

• Upgrading  Fleets.  Even  in  the  highly  constrained  financial  environment  we 
have  been  in  for  some  time,  ATA  airlines  have  been  expending  billions  to  up-
grade their fleets through investments in new airframes and engines, removing 
less  fuel-efficient  aircraft  from  their  fleets,  installing  winglets  to  reduce  drag, 
altering  fan  blades  and  other  measures  aimed  at  improved  aerodynamics.  As  a 
critical element of our commitment to achieve an additional 30 percent fuel effi-
ciency  improvement  by  2025,  Boeing  estimates  that  the  North  American  car-
riers will spend approximately $730 billion on new aircraft through 2026.12 
• Introduction  of  Innovative,  Cutting-Edge  Technologies.  Our  airlines  also  are  in-
vesting millions of dollars in technologies to make existing airframes more effi-
cient. For example, the airlines have undertaken equipage for Required Naviga-
tion  Performance  (RNP)  approach  procedures,  which  provide  navigation  capa-
bility  to  fly  a  more  precise  path  into  an  airport.  ATA  airlines  also  have  devel-
oped  software  to  analyze  flight  paths  and  weather  conditions,  allowing  aircraft 
to fly more direct, efficient routes (subject to air traffic approval). 
• Improved  In-Flight  Operations.  ATA  airlines  are  doing  all  they  can  within  the 
existing ATM system to utilize programs to optimize speed, flight path and alti-
tude,  which  not  only  reduces  fuel  consumption  and  emissions  in  the  air,  but 
avoids  wasting  fuel  waiting  for  a  gate  on  the  ground.  In  addition  to  pursuing 
the use of RNP approach procedures at additional locations, ATA carriers have

worked  with  FAA  to  pioneer  protocols  for  continuous  descent  approaches 
(CDAs),  which  reduce  both  emissions  and  noise,  and  we  are  doggedly  pursuing 
implementation of CDAs where the existing ATM system allows.13 Further, our 
carriers  are  implementing  Automatic  Dependent  Surveillance  Broadcast  (ADS- 
B) satellite tracking technology, which avoids the circuitous routings that occur 
with  today’s  radar-based  systems.  Demonstrating  that  the  efforts  extend  to  the 
smallest  details  of  airline  operation,  our  members  also  have  worked  on  redis-
tribution  of  weight  in  the  belly  of  aircraft  to  improve  aerodynamics  and  have 
introduced life vests on certain domestic routes, allowing them to overfly water 
on a more direct route. 

• Improved  Ground  Operations.  ATA  airlines  also  are  introducing  single-engine 
taxiing  when  conditions  permit,  redesigning  hubs  and  schedules  to  alleviate 
congestion  and  converting  to  electric  ground  support  equipment  when  feasible. 
Further,  they  are  improving  ground  operations  by  plugging  into  electric  gate 
power  where  available  to  avoid  running  auxiliary  power  units  and  using  tugs 
to position aircraft where possible. 

• Reducing  Onboard  Weight.  ATA  airlines  continue  to  exhaustively  review  ways, 
large  and  small,  to  reduce  aircraft  weight—removing  seat-back  phones,  excess 
galley  equipment  and  magazines,  introducing  lighter  seats  and  beverage  carts, 
stripping primer and paint and a myriad of other detailed measures to improve 
fuel efficiency. 

Second,  recognizing  that  improving  fuel  efficiency  with  today’s  carbon-based  fuel 
supply  can  only  take  us  so  far,  ATA  and  its  airlines  are  making  extensive  resource 
commitments to stimulate the development of commercially viable, environmentally 
friendly  alternative  fuels.  As  a  framework  for  doing  this,  we  are  a  founding  and 
principal  member  of  the  Commercial  Aviation  Alternative  Fuels  Initiative  (CAAFI), 
a  consortium  of  airlines,  government,  manufacturers,  fuel  suppliers,  universities, 
airports and other stakeholders who hold the various keys to research, development 
and  responsible  implementation  of  alternative  jet  fuels.  Developing  alternative  jet 
fuels  is  a  ‘‘higher  hurdle’’  than  developing  alternative  fuels  for  ground-based  units, 
as jet fuel must meet rigorous FAA specifications, which include reliability and sta-
bility at altitude and in greatly varying temperature and pressure conditions to en-
sure  safety.  Thus,  absent  a  cooperative  initiative  like  CAAFI,  fuel  providers  almost 
certainly  would  not  undertake  the  investments  needed  to  clear  this  higher  hurdle, 
opting instead for the surer payoff at ground level. 

While  each  entity  involved  in  CAAFI  has  a  role  to  play,  our  airlines  understand 
that—as  end  users  of  the  ultimate  product—they  must  not  only  make  clear  their 
specifications for alternative jet fuels, but also signal the market that we will finan-
cially  back  fuels  meeting  those  specifications.  On  Earth  Day  this  year,  the  ATA 
Board of Directors took another significant step in this regard, issuing the ‘‘ATA Al-
ternative  Fuels  Principles  Document.’’  Among  other  things,  that  document  stipu-
lates that ATA carriers require that any future alternative jet fuel be more environ-
mentally  friendly,  on  a  life-cycle  basis,  than  the  jet  fuel  available  today.  Through 
CAAFI and other partnerships, we are undertaking the work to be sure that tomor-
row’s  alternative  jet  fuel  meets  that  criterion.  And  accomplishing  that  will  ensure 
the  full  decoupling  of  growth  in  aviation  demand  from  growth  in  GHG  emissions. 
Third, while ATA airlines are doing all that they can to promote efficiencies with-
in the current ATM system, the limitations of that system account for 10–15 percent 
of  unnecessary  fuel  burn  and  resulting  emissions.  To  address  this,  and  to  achieve 
much-needed  modernization  of  our  outdated  ATM  system,  ATA  and  its  carriers  are 
working  with  FAA  and  other  agencies  on  a  fundamental  redesign  of  the  system 
through  the  Next  Generation  Air  Transportation  System  (NextGen)  project  and  on 
various  regional  airspace  design  initiatives.  ATA  is  supporting  this  modernization 
initiative  through  our  ‘‘Smart  Skies’’  program.14 However,  congressional  approval, 
including  fair  and  equitable  distribution  of  costs  among  all  system  users,  is  needed 
before significant progress can be made in implementing this system. Congressional 
authorization  and  implementation  of  this  initiative  will  bring  10–15  percent  addi-
tional savings on top of the ATA 30 percent commitment. (See Figure 6). 

13 For  example,  one  ATA  carrier  is  achieving  an  average  savings  of  1,300  pounds  of  CO2 sav-

ings per flight for approaches into the Atlanta airport. 

14 ‘‘Smart  Skies’’  is  a  national  campaign  led  by  ATA  airlines,  which  advocates  modernization 
of the U.S. ATM system and its funding mechanisms. For more on this initiative, see the Smart 
Skies website, at http://www.smartskies.org.

Fourth,  at  the  same  time  ATA  and  its  members  are  pushing  the  envelope  with 
existing  technology,  we  continue  to  contribute  to  work  that  will  advance  new  tech-
nology.  For  example,  ATA  participates  in  key,  joint  government/stakeholder  initia-
tives,  including  the  Steering  Committee  of  the  Partnership  for  AiR  Transportation 
Noise  &  Emissions  Reduction  (PARTNER)  and  the  Environment  and  Energy  Sub-
committee of the FAA Research Engineering and Development Advisory Committee. 
While additional evolutionary environmental improvements are in the pipeline as a 
result of such initiatives, revolutionary environmental breakthroughs can only come 
about  through  the  reinstatement  of  significant  Federal  investments  in  basic  aero-
nautics  research  and  development  programs  at  NASA  and  FAA.  Indeed,  Pratt  & 
Whitney’s new geared turbofan engine, which offers both noise and emissions bene-
fits,  as  well  as  many  features  of  Boeing’s  more  environmentally  efficient  787  were 
spawned through such programs. As we have noted in other contexts, however, con-
gressional  funding  to  NASA  and  FAA  for  aeronautics  research  and  development— 
specifically  including  for  environmental  projects—has  been  cut  significantly  (by 
about  50  percent)  in  the  past  8–10  years,  compromising  the  public-private  partner-
ship for exploring and bringing to market products with significantly improved envi-
ronmental performance.15 Thus, we continue to urge Congress to provide this need-
ed  funding,  which  also  is  critical  to  preserving  America’s  competitiveness  in  aero-
nautics. 
Congress  Should  Complement  the  Airlines’  Initiatives,  Through  Sound  Energy, 

Transportation Planning and Climate Change Policies 

We are confident that the measures ATA is undertaking and supporting will con-
tinue  to  limit  and  reduce  aviation’s  emissions  footprint,  such  that  commercial  avia-
tion  will  remain  a  very  small  source  of  GHG  and  other  emissions.  However,  Con-
gress has a key role to play. First, as noted, congressional approval for implementa-
tion  of  a  modernized  ATM  system  is  critical,  as  is  reinstatement  of  funding  for  re-

15 While  later  funding  cuts  were  even  more  drastic,  a  2002  study  by  the  National  Academy 

of Sciences observed: 

In  constant  year  dollars,  NASA  funding  for  aeronautics  research  was  cut  by  about  one-third 
between  1998  and  2000,  reducing  the  breadth  of  ongoing  research  and  prompting  NASA  to  es-
tablish research programs with reduced goals, particularly with regard to TRL (technology read-
iness level). This significantly reduces the likelihood that the results of NASA research will find 
their  way  into  the  marketplace  in  a  timely  manner,  if  at  all.  The  ultimate  consequence  is  that 
the Federal expenditures are inconsistent with the long-term goal of support for an aviation en-
terprise compatible with national goals for environmental stewardship.

search  and  development  programs  to  foster  aviation  environmental  technology 
breakthroughs.  Further,  while  Congress  generally  is  supporting  several  alternative 
fuel research programs, specific support and funding should be provided for the de-
velopment  of  environmentally  friendly  alternative  jet  fuels.  Thus,  while  a  central 
focus  of  today’s  hearing  is  on  how  climate  change  may  impact  transportation  and 
transportation  infrastructure,  we  must  also  remain  focused  on  how  improving  air 
transportation infrastructure can help minimize the very GHGs of concern. 

As  this  Committee  is  aware,  in  March  2008  the  Transportation  Research  Board 
issued a special report on the ‘‘Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Trans-
portation.’’  That  report  identified  threats  that  aviation  (as  well  as  other  modes  of 
transport)  may  face  under  certain  climate  change  scenarios.  Many  of  the  rec-
ommendations  called  for  further  coordination  among  Federal,  state  and  local  agen-
cies  in  conducting  research  and  transportation  planning  to  mitigate  climate  change 
impacts.  ATA  strongly  supports  data-driven,  coordinated  transportation  planning, 
which  can  help  ensure  cost-effective  deployment  of  resources.  To  this  end,  we  work 
closely with FAA, state governments, the airports and local communities in aviation- 
related  transportation  research  and  planning.  Congress  should  continue  to  support 
FAA’s role in such planning initiatives. 

Just  as  we  ask  Congress  to  work  to  complement  airline  GHG  initiatives,  we  also 
urge Congress to calibrate Federal energy policy and any climate change-related leg-
islation  so  they  do  not  work  against  our  efforts.  As  noted,  ATA’s  recently  revised 
2008 forecast shows that the country’s airlines are likely to lose in the range of $10 
billion  this  year—a  loss  on  par  with  the  worst  year  in  this  industry’s  history,  with 
soaring  fuel  prices  as  the  sole  reason.  Congress  must  help  get  these  prices  under 
control.  The  $62  billion  (plus)  that  the  airlines  will  spend  on  fuel  this  year  is  at 
least  $20  billion  more  than  last  year  and  slightly  more  than  our  combined  fuel  bill 
for the first 4 years of this decade. Sadly, 2008 could turn out to be the worst year 
in  the  industry’s  history.  Unlike  the  temporary  revenue  hits  from  SARS,  9/11  and 
other  one-time  demand  shocks,  the  airlines  now  are  facing  a  massive  structural  in-
crease—with  no  end  in  sight—in  a  virtually  uncontrollable  cost.  Moreover,  there  is 
little  low-hanging  fruit  left  to  harvest.  Unfortunately,  not  even  Chapter  11  can 
lower the price of fuel. 

To many Members of Congress, $10 billion is not a lot of money. Let me add some 
context.  More  than  14,000  airline  jobs  have  been  cut  so  far  this  year,  and  that  is 
just  the  tip  of  the  iceberg.  By  cutting  capacity,  scores  of  communities  stand  to  lose 
all  commercial  air  service  by  early  next  year.  Orders  for  new  planes  have  been 
slashed  and  hundreds  of  older,  less  efficient  planes  have  been  taken  out  of  service. 
We  are  burning  through  cash  at  unprecedented  rates,  barely  surviving  from  month 
to month. The nation’s airlines will never fully recover from this economic blow, and 
more  airlines—in  addition  to  the  nine  that  already  have  filed  for  bankruptcy  or 
stopped  operating—may  simply  shut  down.  That  means  even  more  job  losses  and 
untold harm to families and the economy. 

Committee  members  and  Congress,  for  that  matter,  may  ask  why  the  country 
should care that its airlines are on the brink of financial disaster and—some would 
say—about  to  implode.  The  answer  is  simple:  this  Nation’s  economy  is  inextricably 
linked  to  the  viability  of  its  air  transportation  system.  If  the  airlines  continue  to 
spiral  downward,  so  will  the  economy.  Aviation  contributes  $690  billion  to  the  U.S. 
GDP—that’s equal to heating oil costs for 376 million households for one winter, 24 
million new cars and 10 million new jobs. 

If  Congress  does  not  turn  things  around  very  soon,  the  impact  on  the  country’s 
economy  will  be  even  worse.  Analysts  are  predicting  that  a  20  percent  reduction  in 
capacity  may  not  be  enough  to  save  the  industry.  Based  on  the  communities  that 
stand  to  lose  service,  airline  hubs  will  be  decimated,  tens  of  thousands  more  jobs 
will  be  eliminated  and  tourist  destinations  will  be  devastated  by  huge  cuts  in  the 
number of flights. Realistically, rural areas will be hit the hardest by the cuts, leav-
ing thousands of square miles without air service. 

Not  only  must  Congress  act  with  sound  energy  policy,  but  it  also  must  forbear 
from  adopting  climate  change  policies  that  would  further  exacerbate  the  fuel  price 
crisis. While the Senate recently declined to go forward with the GHG cap-and-trade 
program  proposed  in  the  Lieberman-Warner  Climate  Security  Act,  which  would 
have  applied  an  additional  fuel  surcharge  on  airlines’  jet  fuel,  we  understand  that 
many  in  Congress  still  are  interested  in  applying  such  proposals  to  aviation.  Not 
only  is  an  additional  ‘‘price  signal’’  unnecessary  for  our  industry,  but  recent  events 
have shown the crippling effects that exorbitant fuel prices can have. We urge Con-
gress  to  avoid  counterproductive,  punitive  approaches  that  further  siphon  away 
funds  that  the  airlines  otherwise  could  use  to  invest  in  newer  aircraft  and  other 
fuel- and GHG-savings measures.

Conclusion 

I  close  by  asking  you  to  note  the  achievements  that  commercial  airlines  have 
made in reducing fuel burn and GHGs, particularly when compared to other indus-
tries,  and  the  actions  that  we  are  taking  to  continue  our  progress  in  this  regard. 
While we are fully committed to working with Congress and are asking for congres-
sional leadership and support in each of the areas I have described, we are not ask-
ing  you  to  work  for  us,  we’re  asking  you  to  work  with  us  in  addressing  these  envi-
ronmental,  energy  and  transportation  concerns.  We  also  are  urging  you  to  refrain 
from  adopting  policies  that  would  work  against  our  efforts.  A  vibrant,  competitive 
and growing aviation sector is a key part of the solution, not an impediment to en-
suring  a  future  where  a  strong  economy,  freedom  from  foreign  oil  and  cleaner  air 
are the order of the day. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. Meenan. We do care, obvi-

ously. And we thank you for your testimony. 

And now, Mr. Treadwell? 

STATEMENT OF MEAD TREADWELL, CHAIR, 

U.S. ARCTIC RESEARCH COMMISSION 

Mr. TREADWELL. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice Chair-

man. Thank you for having me here today. 

On behalf of my fellow U.S. Arctic Research Commission commis-
sioners,  this  is  a  very  important  thing  to  consider  in  a  hearing  on 
climate and transportation, is the Arctic. 

During  this  International  Polar  Year,  the  United  States  and 
other nations are laying down an Arctic Observing Network to bet-
ter understand, model, and predict the vast changes coming to the 
northern part of the globe. This hearing has been focusing both on 
climate  and  its  effects  on  transport,  and  then  transport  and  its  ef-
fects on climate. 

The Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee, acting on our 
Commission’s  recommendation,  has  commissioned  an  Interagency 
Research  Plan  on  Arctic  Infrastructure,  in  light  of  climate  change. 
And  this  will  cover  many  climate  impacts  on  transportation  in  the 
Arctic,  including  roads,  maritime  transport,  and  the  need  for  im-
proved oil-spill research in ice-covered waters. 

I’m going to focus, today, however, on shipping. The Arctic Coun-
cil’s  eight  nations  with  indigenous  participants  in  the  global  ship-
ping  industry  are  conducting  an  Arctic  Marine  Shipping  Assess-
ment, due to be published in 2009. I’ve given you a brochure about 
that assessment. While science is finding the Arctic to be suddenly 
and  surprisingly  accessible,  our  assessment  is  finding  that  regular 
Arctic ocean shipping tied to specific resource development projects, 
tourism,  or  serving  the  needs  of  Arctic  communities  is  large  now, 
and  is  growing.  For  the  United  States,  it’s  necessary  to  recognize 
the Alaska purchase in 1867 made us an Arctic nation. Great circle 
air  routes  through  the  Arctic  currently  carry  the  bulk  of  travelers 
and  air  cargo  between  these  continents.  Today’s  Arctic  infrastruc-
ture is global infrastructure. 

In  the  21st  century,  Arctic  seaways  have  the  potential  to  serve 
as a major venue for shipping between these continents, as explor-
ers  envisioned  as  early  as  500  years  ago.  Much  of  our  work  as  a 
Commission  is  to  ensure  that  the  U.S.  Government  does  its  home-
work—homework  we  believe  is  necessary  in  response  to  an  acces-
sible Arctic Ocean.

Let  me  focus  on  five  points  and  direct  the  Committee  to  sources 

82 

of additional information. 

First,  climate  is  changing  to  create  an  accessible  Arctic.  Sea-ice 
coverage is reducing in both area and thickness faster than our cli-
mate models predicted. This, combined with the advent of more ef-
ficient  ice-breaking  technology  and  global  demand  for  Arctic  re-
sources,  works  to  make  Arctic  shipping  more  economically  feasible 
and attractive to investors. In a set of slides I’ve given you, we can 
show the ice minimums in 2002 and what they’ve receded to 2007, 
and  a  second  set  of  slides  explains  some  changes  in  shipping  tech-
nology,  ice-breaking  technology  that—they’re  making  icebreakers 
are more efficient. 

Second,  Arctic  residents,  governments,  and  industry  are  assess-
ing  both  the  opportunities  and  the  challenges  of  an  accessible  Arc-
tic.  Within  these  assessments  is  a  fundamental  question.  Will 
trans-Arctic seaways be as important to global shipping as the Pan-
ama  and  Suez  Canals,  or  will  the  Arctic  Ocean  continue  more  as 
a  venue  for  shipping  in  and  out  of  the  Arctic  itself,  for  tourism, 
local needs, and bringing natural resources to market? 

Third,  policies  are  being  conceived,  developed,  and  implemented 
toward  a  goal  of  ensuring  that  shipping  in  the  Arctic  is,  to  quote 
my  colleague  at  the  Department  of  State,  Assistant  Secretary  Dan 
Sullivan,  ‘‘safe,  secure,  and  reliable.’’  To  me,  those  three  words 
have  large  meanings.  ‘‘Safe’’  refers  to  protecting  human  life  and 
mitigating  any  ill  effects  shipping  will  have  on  the  environment, 
biodiversity, cultures, and traditions of the Arctic. Likewise, navies 
and coast guards must expand their capacity to ensure security for 
those ships, particularly those carrying strategic commodities. And 
finally,  the  word  ‘‘reliable’’  refers  to  issues  raised  by  the  shipping 
industry  itself.  The  Arctic  Ocean  is  a  patchwork  quilt  of  tolls  and 
regulations  by  several  coastal  nations.  The  U.S.  Arctic  Research 
Commission  continues  to  urge  the  Senate  to  accede  to  the  United 
Nations  Convention  on  Law  of  the  Sea,  which  will  help  set  some 
of the rules in the Arctic related to shipping. 

Fourth,  strong  research  programs  are  needed  in  the  Arctic 
Ocean,  and  some  of  that  research  is  on  deadline.  Decisions  to  be 
made  by  governments  on  climate  issues  require  an  understanding 
of  what  is  happening  in  the  Arctic  Ocean,  the  Greenland  Ice  Cap, 
and  the  changing  heat,  freshwater,  and  greenhouse  gas  budgets  of 
the Earth. There are several wildcard issues related to Arctic ship-
ping  identified  through  the  AMSA  process,  and  these  include  un-
derstanding the effects of air pollution and noise from ships on the 
ecosystem. 

Finally,  and  fifth,  an  accessible  Arctic  means  a  need  for  invest-
ment. Your Committee, Mr. Chairman, has recognized that and re-
ported legislation calling for construction of two new polar-class ice-
breakers  for  the  Coast  Guard  and  the  Nation  while  maintaining 
the  existing  fleet  in  working  condition.  We  believe  these  ships  will 
be  used,  as  they  are  now,  as  research  platforms  and  as  the  visible 
U.S.  maritime  presence  in  these  regions.  But,  the  advent  of  Arctic 
transportation  means  the  other,  more  traditional  missions  of  the 
Coast Guard will take center stage. And these ships are needed to 
provide  the  same  protections  U.S.  Coast  Guard  affords  the  rest  of 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:04 Feb 13, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\78852.TXT JACKIE

83 

the Nation—search and rescue, law enforcement, border protection, 
environmental protection, and spill response. 

An  accessible  Arctic  also  means  new,  expanded  routes  for  U.S. 
military  sealift  to  move  assets  from  one  part  of  the  world  to  the 
other. In Coast Guard, our polar icebreakers are an essential com-
ponent to guarantee this polar maritime mobility exists. 

Mr. Chairman, to conclude, we understand it’s our Nation’s goal, 
expressed  with  other  nations,  to  reverse  the  trend  of  climate 
change caused by humans. In the Arctic, research to support adap-
tation  to,  and  mitigation  of,  climate  change  is  high  on  our  agenda. 
But,  as  more  forces  than  climate  are  working  to  produce  an  acces-
sible  Arctic,  it’s  essential  our  Nation  act  now.  Under  the  principle 
of  freedom  of  navigation,  global  shipping  could  come  to  our  door-
step,  whether  we  invite  it  or  not.  And  whether  you  envision  the 
Arctic  Ocean  as  an—as  a  new  seaway  for  trans-Arctic  shipping, 
competitive  with  Panama  and  Suez  Canals,  or  only  foresee  an  ex-
pansion  of  the  current  shipping  in  and  out  of  the  Arctic,  the  time 
to prepare is now. 

Thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MEAD TREADWELL, CHAIR, 

U.S. ARCTIC RESEARCH COMMISSION 

Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Co-Chairman, and Members of the Committee. 
My  name  is  Mead  Treadwell.  Since  2006,  I  have  chaired  the  U.S.  Arctic  Research 
Commission  (USARC).1 As  a  senior  fellow  at  the  Institute  of  the  North,  based  in 
Anchorage, Alaska, and in the private sector, I have worked for much of my career 
on the economics, feasibility, and sustainability of Arctic transportation in shipping, 
pipelines, railroads, tourism and aviation.2 

On  behalf  of  my  fellow  Commissioners,  thank  you  for  your  invitation  to  be  here 
today.  The  Arctic  component  to  this  hearing  is  essential.  During  this  International 
Polar Year, the United States and other nations are laying down an Arctic Observ-
ing  Network 3 to  better  understand,  model  and  predict  the  vast  changes  coming  to 
the  northern  part  of  the  globe.  The  Arctic  Council’s  eight  nations,  with  indigenous 
participants  and  the  global  shipping  industry,  are  conducting  the  Arctic  Marine 
Shipping Assessment, due to be published in 2009.4 While science is finding the Arc-
tic  to  be  suddenly,  and  surprisingly  accessible,  our  assessment  is  finding  that  reg-
ular  Arctic  Ocean  shipping,  tied  to  specific  resource  development  projects,  tourism, 
or serving the needs of Arctic communities is large now, and is growing.5 New Arc-
tic-capable  ships  are  under  construction  in  Southeast  Asia  and  Europe.  That  trend 

1 Under  the  Arctic  Research  and  Policy  Act  of  1984,  the  seven  Commissioners  of  the  USARC 
are appointed by the President and report to the President and the Congress on goals and prior-
ities for the U.S. Arctic Research Program. That program is coordinated by the Interagency Arc-
tic  Research  Policy  Committee,  (IARPC)  chaired  by  National  Science  Foundation  Director  Dr. 
Arden  Bement,  who  is  also  an  ex-officio  member  of  the  Commission.  See  www.arctic.gov  for 
Commission publications, including the Commission’s 2007 Goals Report. 

2 The  Institute  of  the  North,  www.institutenorth.org,  founded  by  former  Alaska  Governor  and 
U.S.  Interior  Secretary  Walter  J.  Hickel,  has  programs  that  focus  on  economics  and  policy  re-
lated to management of common resources, onshore and offshore. Our work in Arctic infrastruc-
ture  (including  energy,  transportation  and  telecommunication)  supports  the  work  of  the  eight- 
nation  Arctic  Council  and  the  circumpolar,  regional  governments  of  the  Northern  Forum.  Our 
defense, security and geography studies stem from Alaska’s unique, strategic location. 

3 AON  report  is  here:  http://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/arctic/iarpc/start.jsp.  Pending  legislation 
to  support  the  Integrated  Ocean  Observing  System  is  needed  to  assure  that  studies  of  Arctic 
climate changes will be initialized and maintained. These are important to understand the proc-
esses that affect the ice cover and circulation of the Arctic Ocean and thus shipping.

uty Director of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, a former U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker cap-
tain. For details on AMSA. See: http://arcticportal.org/pame/amsa.

brings  with  it  the  need  for  new  policies—rulemaking,  research,  and  investment— 
by governments of the Arctic region. 

In  the  United  States,  it  is  necessary  to  recognize  that  the  Alaska  Purchase  in 
1867  made  us  an  Arctic  nation.  Our  ocean  boundaries  are  more  than  the  Atlantic 
and Pacific. In the 20th century, the advent of aircraft, missiles, and missile defense 
made the Arctic region a major venue for projection of power and a frontier for pro-
tecting  the  security  of  North  America,  Asia  and  Europe.  Great  circle  air  routes 
through the Arctic currently carry the bulk of travelers and air cargo between these 
continents.  Today’s  Arctic  infrastructure  is  global  infrastructure.  In  the  21st  cen-
tury,  Arctic  seaways  have  the  potential  to  serve  as  a  major  venue  for  shipping  be-
tween these continents, as explorers envisioned as early as 500 years ago. 

Much  of  the  U.S.  Arctic  Research  Commission’s  work  is  to  encourage  the  U.S. 
Government to do its homework—homework that is necessary in response to an ac-
cessible  Arctic  Ocean.6 In  today’s  testimony,  I  will  focus  on  five  points,  and  direct 
the Committee to sources of additional information. 

First, climate is changing to create an accessible Arctic. Sea ice coverage is reduc-
ing in area and thickness faster than our climate models predicted.7 This, combined 
with the advent of more efficient icebreaking technology, and global demand for Arc-
tic resources, works to make Arctic shipping more economically feasible and attrac-
tive to investors.8 

Second, Arctic residents, governments and industry are assessing both the oppor-
tunities  and  the  challenges  of  an  accessible  Arctic.9 Within  these  assessments  is  a 
fundamental question: Will trans-Arctic seaways be as important to global shipping 
as the Panama and Suez Canals? Or, will the Arctic Ocean continue more as venue 
for shipping in and out of the Arctic itself, for tourism, local needs, and for bringing 
natural resources to market? 

Third,  policies  are  being  conceived,  developed  and  implemented  toward  a  goal  of 
ensuring  that  shipping  in  the  Arctic  is,  to  quote  my  colleague  at  the  Department 
of  State,  Assistant  Secretary  Dan  Sullivan,  ‘‘safe,  secure  and  reliable.’’ 10 To  me, 
those  three  words  have  large  meaning.  Safe  refers  to  protecting  human  life,  and 
mitigating  any  ill  effects  shipping  will  have  on  the  environment,  biodiversity,  cul-
tures  and  traditions  of  the  Arctic.  Likewise,  navies  and  coast  guards  must  expand 
their capacity to ensure security for those ships, particularly those carrying strategic 
commodities. Finally, the word reliable refers to issues raised by the shipping indus-
try.  The  Arctic  Ocean  is  a  ‘‘patchwork  quilt’’  of  tolls  and  regulations  by  several 
coastal nations. Arctic shipping will grow when rules are certain and when products 
can  be  delivered  competitively  with  other  routes.  This  means  on  a  time  and  cost 
basis, not just on shorter distances. 

Mr.  Chairman,  a  regime  for  safe,  secure,  and  reliable  shipping  is  something  our 
Nation  can  lead  in  developing,  through  existing  mechanisms  like  the  International 
Maritime  Organization,  the  Arctic  Council,  and—when  acceded  to  by  the  U.S.—via 
the  Law  of  the  Sea  convention.  The  U.S.  Arctic  Research  Commission  continues  to 
urge the Senate to accede to this convention. 

The United States last revised its Arctic policy in 1994. While environmental pro-
tection  was  then  made  a  principal  objective,  climate  change  and  growth  in  Arctic 
shipping were not contemplated.11 As the Executive Branch currently conducts a re-
view of U.S. Arctic policy, the Commission has urged consideration of policies to en-
sure safe, secure, and reliable shipping. 

Fourth,  strong  research  programs  are  needed  in  the  Arctic  Ocean,  and  some  of 
that  research  is  on  deadline.  The  U.S.  Arctic  Research  Commission  has  developed 
a  set  of  research  goals  related  to  shipping,  and  those  goals  will  be  included  in  the 
report  due  to  Congress  in  2009.  Decisions  to  be  made  by  governments  on  climate 
issues  require  understanding  of  what  is  happening  in  the  Arctic  Ocean,  the  Green-
land  icecap,  in  the  changing  heat,  freshwater  and  greenhouse  gas  budgets  of  the 
earth.

Several ‘‘wild card’’ issues related to Arctic shipping have been identified through 
the  AMSA  process  and  will  be  included  in  the  Commission’s  goals  for  shipping  re-
search as part of the 2009 report. These include understanding the effects of air pol-
lution  and  noise  from  ships  on  the  Arctic  ecosystem.  As  well,  the  tradeoff  between 
warming  effects  of  ship  emissions  in  the  Arctic  and  potential  reduced  emissions 
from  shipping  worldwide,  due  to  shorter  routes,  is  a  goal  of  study.  Also,  the  U.S. 
and Iceland are cooperating on development of hydrogen technologies. The prospect 
of  hydrogen-powered  ships,  under  development  by  Iceland,  is  of  interest  to  the  en-
tire Arctic community. 

The  Interagency  Arctic  Research  Policy  Committee,  acting  on  the  USARC’s  rec-
ommendation,  has  commissioned  an  interagency  research  plan  on  Arctic  infrastruc-
ture,  in  light  of  climate  change.  This  will  cover  many  climate  impacts  on  transpor-
tation in the Arctic, including roads, maritime transport, and the need for improved 
oil spill research in ice-covered waters.12 

Nations  are  mustering  bathymetric  and  seismic  expeditions  to  delineate  the  ex-
tended  continental  shelf  of  the  Arctic  region,  for  new  territorial  claims  allowed 
under  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea  (UNCLOS).  And  as 
those  claims  by  some  nations  could  make  parts  of  the  Arctic  Ocean  legally  less  ac-
cessible to research, the science community is pressing to ensure greater access with 
the diplomatic community.13 

Fifth  and  finally,  an  accessible  Arctic  means  a  need  for  investment.  Your  Com-
mittee, Mr. Chairman, has recognized that, and reported legislation calling for con-
struction  of  two  new  Polar  class  icebreakers  for  the  Coast  Guard  and  the  nation, 

12 Under the leadership of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Cold Region Research and Engi-
neering  Laboratory,  in  Hanover,  N.H.,  the  plan  will  cover  research  and  development  goals  for 
civil works and housing (including permafrost and shoreline erosion), oil spills, energy use, and 
marine transportation. 

13 The USARC has been informed by the Department of State that applications from the U.S. 
to Russia for approval to conduct marine scientific research in Russia’s Exclusive Economic Zone 
was denied 11 of the 13 times requested between 1996 and 2006, and 6 of the 14 times between 
1992  and  1995  (Personal  communication  to  the  Chair  and  Executive  Director  of  the  USARC, 
April 7, 2008). 

See  also  this  appeal  was  submitted  by  the  USARC,  and  others,  to  the  U.S.  Department  of 

State. 

In anticipation of the meeting of ministers from the five Arctic coastal nations 

In Ilulisat, Greenland, on May 28, 2008 

Appeal to the U.S. Department of State 

As  you,  representing  the  United  States,  meet  with  representatives  from  other  Arctic  coastal 
states,  to  discuss  the  future  of  the  Arctic  Ocean,  we,  representing  the  U.S.  science  community 
working  in  this  region,  make  this  appeal:  please  take  all  necessary  effort  to  enable  research  to 
thrive by ensuring free and open scientific access to the Arctic. The open nature of the Antarctic 
Treaty,  and  the  free  support  of  and  exchanges  in  science,  have  been  the  hallmark  of  inter-
national  cooperation  on  that  continent  for  50  years.  The  Arctic  also  would  benefit  from  such 
openness. 

We  especially  urge  the  coastal  Arctic  states  to  remove  obstacles  to  ship  access  for  research 
in the Arctic Ocean. In recent years, important scientific expeditions have been canceled through 
parts of the Arctic due to the expense and complications of national rules for foreign ships wish-
ing to enter the Exclusive Economic Zone of certain Arctic nations. Further, some ships—whose 
voyages  were  solely  dedicated  to  research—have  been  categorically  denied  access.  We  are  con-
cerned that Arctic nations’ expanded jurisdiction of the ocean floor, that will come about through 
Law of the Sea claims, threatens to further limit the full range of customary research activities 
that need to be conducted by scientists in the Arctic. Although it may be useful to ensure rights 
of  inspection  for  such  vessels,  there  are  many  benefits  to  be  derived  from  open  access  for  sci-
entific purposes. 

Second,  please  address  the  well-documented  need  for  sharing  of  data  that  has  been,  or  will 
be, collected in the Arctic Ocean region. We appeal to nations to continue to make available pre-
viously  collected  data,  and  to  commit  to  further  sharing  of  new  data  collected  within  jurisdic-
tional borders. 

Knowledge  gained  from  Arctic  research  is  important  to  the  entire  world.  Policy  decisions  on 
climate change, energy, environment, human health, security, commerce, and other subjects will 
be made by many nations based on this knowledge. Scientific research should be based on sound 
conclusions drawn from valid data, unfettered by national borders.

while  maintaining  the  existing  fleet  in  working  condition.14 The  U.S.  Arctic  Re-
search  Commission  has  urged  the  President  and  Congress  to  move  expeditiously  in 
building  and  maintaining  those  ships.  Certainly,  they  will  be  used  as  they  are 
now—as research platforms and as the visible U.S. maritime presence in both polar 
regions.  But  the  advent  of  Arctic  transportation  means  the  other,  more  traditional 
missions  of  the  Coast  Guard  will  take  center  stage.  These  ships  are  needed  to  pro-
vide  the  same  protections  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  affords  the  rest  of  the  nation: 
search  and  rescue,  law  enforcement,  border  protection,  environmental  protection 
and oil spill response.15 

Aid  to  commerce  is  an  important  mission  of  our  Great  Lakes  icebreakers.  Under 
a  regime  worked  out  with  Canada,  the  St.  Lawrence  Seaway/Great  Lakes  system 
has  become  an  important  part  of  the  global  transportation  network.  The  Executive 
Order  signed  by  President  Franklin  Roosevelt,  committing  icebreakers  to  support 
U.S. maritime commerce could apply to the U.S. Arctic as well.16 

Polar  class  icebreakers  also  support  the  essential  mission  of  national  presence  in 
the  Arctic  and  the  Antarctic,  both  in  maintaining  our  position  and  in  supporting 
freedom  of  navigation.  Indeed,  an  accessible  Arctic  Ocean  also  means  new  or  ex-
panded routes for the U.S. military sealift to move assets from one part of the world 
to another. Coast Guard polar icebreakers are an essential component to guarantee 
that this U.S. polar maritime mobility exists. 

Shipping  and  research  activities  in  the  Arctic  depend  today  on  a  strong  system 
to  predict  ice  conditions,  provided  by  satellites  above,  and  analysis  by  our  Navy/ 
NOAA/Coast  Guard  National  Ice  Center,  near  here  in  Suitland,  Maryland.  Current 
activity  in  the  Arctic  depends  on  good  meteorology,  developed  in  cooperation  with 
our  neighbors.  Appropriate  spill  response  and  search  and  rescue  require  additional 
investment. My predecessor, George Newton, as Chair of the USARC has spoken of 
the necessity for an ‘‘Arctic 911’’ capability, and led the effort to encourage the Na-
tional  Geospatial  Intelligence  Agency  (NGA)  to  add  the  Arctic  region  to  the  oceans 
of  the  world  supported  by  notices  to  mariners.  The  question  of  where  we  need  new 
port facilities, as safe harbors and transshipping points, is yet to be fully addressed. 
Mr. Chairman, to conclude, we understand it is this Nation’s goal—expressed with 
other nations—to reverse the trend of climate change caused by humans. In the Arc-
tic,  research  to  support  adaptation  to  and  mitigation  of  climate  change  is  high  on 
our  agenda.  But  as  more  forces  than  climate  are  working  to  produce  an  accessible 
Arctic,  it  is  essential  that  our  Nation  act  now.  Research,  policies  and  coordinated 
investment  in  infrastructure  will  ensure  safe,  secure,  and  reliable  Arctic  shipping. 
Under the principle of freedom of navigation, global shipping can come to our door-
step  whether  we  invite  it  or  not.  Whether  you  envision  the  Arctic  Ocean  as  a  new 
seaway,  for  trans-Arctic  shipping,  competitive  with  the  Panama  and  Suez  Canals, 
or  only  foresee  an  expansion  of  the  current  shipping  in  and  out  of  the  Arctic,  the 
time to prepare is now.

I want to ask Mr. Friedman a question. Concerns about whether 
ethanol  is  actually  better  than  gasoline,  in  terms  of  its  emissions 
of greenhouse gases. Do you think we should put stronger require-
ments on greenhouse gas emissions from ethanol producers? 

Mr. FRIEDMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Well,  basically,  we  need  strong  greenhouse  gas  requirements  on 
every fuel that is used in transportation. The science on the global 
warming reductions associated with ethanol is continuing to evolve. 
What  we’re  learning  is  that  corn  ethanol  may  not  be  as  good  for 
the climate as we once thought. Both for those reasons and for con-
cerns  about  food  prices,  we  need  to  basically  evolve  from  corn  as 
an  ethanol  source,  to  waste  products,  to  wood  products  in  order  to 
produce  ethanol.  These  so-called  cellulosic  ethanol  resources,  if 
done  sustainably,  can  dramatically  cut  global  warming  pollution 
and can be part of a broader solution that includes renewable elec-
tricity  and  clean  hydrogen,  but  we’re  not  going  to  get  these  solu-
tions  unless  we  have  a  low  carbon  fuel  standard,  a  policy  that  is 
going  to  require  all  fuels  to  get  better  over  time.  And  we  probably 
also won’t have this unless we make sure we have the vehicles out 
there—the  plug-in  hybrids,  the  fuel-cell  vehicles,  the  electric  vehi-
cles—that can use these cleaner energy resources. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Let  me  ask  you—you  identify  corn  for  the 
problems  that  it  creates  and—by  way  of  shortages  and  other 
things—forgive me, they’ve managed to break the code here— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.—and  is  there  any  improvement,  vis-a`-vis 
emissions,  if  sugar  ethanol  is  introduced?  Is  that  substantially 
more efficient? I heard what you said. You said all fuels should be 
examined for—— 

Mr.  FRIEDMAN.  It  does  look  like  sugar-based  ethanol—for  exam-
ple,  the  sugar  cane  used  in  Brazil—can  be  reduce  global  warming 
pollution.  But,  even  there,  anytime  we  talk  about  using  a  crop  to 
make  fuel,  we  need  to  make  sure  that,  by  using  that  crop  for  fuel 
instead  of  food,  we’re  not  encouraging  someone  somewhere  else  to 
cut down a forest to replace that fuel. That’s the real dynamic that 
we have to avoid here. 

So, some sugar-based ethanol could make a lot of sense; but, too 
much,  and  it  may  actually  contribute  to  either  deforestation  or 
clearing  of  land  that  could  actually  generate  more  global  warming 
pollution than you could save. 

Using  food  for  fuel  is  a  tricky  proposition,  and  it’s  definitely 
something that, I think, with good investment in cellulosic ethanol, 
especially  from  waste  products,  that  we  can  move  away  from  over 
time.  It  can  potentially  form  the  base  for  what  we’re  doing  right 
now. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Is  the  technology  available  to  make  the 
conversion  to  using  waste  products  to  fuel  the  development  of  eth-
anol—to the point now that it can be done in the volumes that mat-
ter? 

Mr.  FRIEDMAN.  Well,  thankfully,  we’re  about  to  find  out.  There 
has  been  significant  investment  in  cellulosic  ethanol  plants—in 
part, funded by the Department of Energy and work by Congress— 
but  right  now  we  don’t  have  large-scale  production  of  those  fuels; 
it’s  probably  going  to  take  several  years  before  we  will  see  if  we 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:04 Feb 13, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00091 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\78852.TXT JACKIE

88 

can, for example, get cellulosic ethanol for only, say, $2.00 a gallon. 
If  we  get  the  breakthroughs  we  need,  it  will  become  one  of  the 
added biofuel resources. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. But, the union is concerned about the time 
that  we  have  to  make  changes  in  global  warming—significant 
changes—and asked for far larger reductions than almost any other 
really  responsible  organization.  If  we  don’t  have  the  ability  to 
produce  products  in  sufficient  volume  for  several  years,  it  doesn’t 
sound  like  we’re  on  a  good  track  to  get  going  on  what  we  need  to 
do currently. 

Mr. FRIEDMAN. Well, that’s a great point, and that is part of the 
reason  why  it’s  not  only  about  pushing  better  fuels,  it’s  also  about 
getting  vehicles  and  more  alternatives  to  vehicles  out  there.  We’re 
not  going  to  solve  global  warming  with  a  single  silver  bullet,  with 
the  wave  of  a  magic  wand.  We  need  a  portfolio  of  options  and  a 
portfolio  of  policies.  Biofuels,  I  think,  will  be  able  to  be  a  part  of 
that, but we can’t expect them to carry the whole load. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Yes, we’re all hoping for a silver bullet. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  I  ask,  with  the  indulgence  of  Senator  Ste-

vens, for one more question that—— 

Even  with  fuel  efficiency  improvements,  airplanes,  Mr.  Meenan, 
will  not  be  as  efficient  as  trains,  particularly  for  journeys  of  400 
miles  or  less,  and  particularly  in  highly  populated  areas.  Doesn’t 
it  make  sense,  environmentally  as  well  as  economically,  to  invest 
more  in  rail?  Shouldn’t  we  be  encouraging—and  I  ask  this  for  any 
one of you who would like to respond—shouldn’t we be encouraging 
the  most  efficient  travel  possible?  And  as  it  appears  now,  it’s  rail. 
Any comments on that? 

Mr. MEENAN. Senator, I think—— 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Mr. Meenan? 
Mr.  MEENAN.—I  think  the  second  part  of  your  question  was  the 
answer  that  I  would  give  you,  which  is,  we  should  be  encouraging 
the most efficient—energy efficient transportation possible. In some 
markets,  that  may  be  rail.  It  may  be,  in  a  very  high-density  mar-
ket,  that  may  make  perfect  sense.  But,  in  other  markets,  similar 
distances,  you  may  not  have  that  density,  and  air  is  a  better  en-
ergy-efficient alternative than 200 cars making that trip, for exam-
ple. 

So, we’re open to all kinds of—we also believe, though, that pub-
lic  investment  ought  to  also  be  directed  at  finding  more  efficient 
ways—energy-efficient  ways  of  advancing  air  transportation,  as 
well.  And  that’s  one  of  the  reasons  we’re  encouraging  more  invest-
ment in alternative fuel research for aviation. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Yes,  but,  also,  a  question  that’s  often 
raised,  as  you  well  know,  sir,  is  whether  or  not  distances  to  travel 
have to figure into the best manner to transport people. And when 
you  see—in  Europe,  for  instance,  if  you  want  to  go  from  Brussels, 
where we have our NATO headquarters, to other cities, like Paris, 
when you have an hour-and-20-minute ride for 200 miles, it’s hard 
to find an airplane trip that you can take there. So, that has to be 
a consideration, as well as population density. 

Mr.  MEENAN.  But,  there  are  also  differences  in  existing  infra-
structure  in  Europe  that  are  not  necessarily  replicated  in  the 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:04 Feb 13, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00092 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\78852.TXT JACKIE

United  States,  so  that  we  couldn’t,  for  example,  have  all  destina-
tions  within  400  miles  of  Washington,  D.C.,  linked  by  rail,  I  don’t 
believe, and do it efficiently, but we could do it in certain high-den-
sity corridors. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. I’ll take no longer. We will keep the record 

open for questions. 
Senator Stevens? 
Senator STEVENS. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Been an 

interesting hearing. 

You  know—and,  Mr.  Friedman,  I  respect  your  comments,  but  I 
don’t  see  anything  that  is  dealing  with  the  basic  balance  of  cost 
against  change,  particularly  in  terms  of  some  of  these  ethanols. 
Ethanol  costs  a  great  deal  more,  really,  than  oil  or  gas  right  now, 
and  it’s  subsidized.  We  took  away  all  the  subsidies  for  oil  and  gas 
in  the  past,  but  we’re  applying  them  now  to  ethanols.  The  more 
ethanol, more subsidy. How do you get down to balancing the over-
all cost to the Nation of this change? 

Mr. FRIEDMAN. Thank you, Senator, for the question. 
First, I would say there are definitely still substantial incentives 
for petroleum fuels, whether they be tax credits or access to public 
lands—and, in fact—— 

Senator  STEVENS.  I  hate  to  interrupt  you,  but  there  is  no  such 
thing  as  access  to  public  lands  right  now  for  oil  and  gas  explo-
ration; it has just actually been static now for at least 10 years. 

Mr. FRIEDMAN. But, I think, when we look at the cost of ethanol, 
this  is  one  of  the  reasons  why  we  do  need  the  incentives,  in  order 
to get the prices down. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  the  incentives  are  adding  to  the  cost  to 
the  public.  It’s  just  a  question  of  whether  you  put  it  on  the  tax-
payer  or  on  the  purchaser  of  the  ethanol.  Ethanol  is  so  subsidized 
today,  it’s  limited  in  expansion.  Why  rest  on  the  ethanol  alter-
native? 

Mr.  FRIEDMAN.  Well,  one  of  the  great  things  that  I  think  you 
point to is, actually, what we need to do is move away from simple 
tax  credits  for  any  one  specific  fuel,  and,  instead,  move  tax  credits 
to  performance  basis.  You  should  get  a  higher  tax  credit  if  you’re 
a lower-carbon fuel. If we encourage performance, then the best so-
lutions  will  emerge.  Maybe  it  will,  maybe  it  won’t,  be  ethanol. 
Maybe  it  will  be  low-carbon  electricity,  maybe  it  will  be  hydrogen. 
But,  if  we  encourage  increased  performance,  maybe  we  can  even 
get  refineries  to  improve  their  efficiency  so  there’s  a  little  bit  less 
global  warming  pollution  associated  with  gasoline.  Performance- 
based standards are the key. 

So,  I  do  agree  that  we  need  to  move  away  from,  maybe,  specific 
products,  and  move  toward  performance,  and  especially  global 
warming performance, when we look at our incentives. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Mr.  Hamberger,  all  you  need  to  do  is  find  me 
the  money  to  build  about  150  miles  of  railroad,  and  we  could  be 
connected  to  the  Canadian  rail  system  and  have  a  lot  cheaper 
transportation  in  the  long  run.  You  think  you  could  find  that  kind 
of money, 150 miles, these days? 

Mr.  HAMBERGER.  Well,  I  know  that  your  former  colleague,  Sen-
ator  Murkowski,  believed  very  strongly  in  that,  as  well,  and—I 
don’t  know  where  that  planning  process  is.  I  believe  the  Canadian

90 

and the U.S. governments were supposed to put together a commis-
sion to take a look at that. 

Senator  STEVENS.  And  we  should,  we  really  should.  I  think  that 
the  difficulty  is  the  people  don’t  realize  the  great  efficiency  of  the 
rail  system,  particularly  in  places  like  we  live,  in  Alaska.  As  Mr. 
Treadwell  could  tell  you,  that  the  advent,  now,  of  thinking  we’re 
going  to  have  trans-Arctic  steam—or  ship  transportation  is  sort  of 
hard  to  realize,  it  might  come  true.  Barring  that,  Mr.  Treadwell, 
how  does  it  look,  as  far  as  getting  the  kind  of  agreements  that 
would be necessary to use the Arctic for surface transportation? 

Mr.  TREADWELL.  Well,  as  you  know,  the  Senate  is  considering— 
excuse me. Thank you, Senator, for the question. As you know, the 
Senate  is  considering  approval  of,  or  accession  to,  the  Law  of  the 
Sea  Treaty.  And  the  Law  of  the  Sea  Treaty,  basically,  deals  with 
the  territorial  issues.  Under  the  United  Nations,  we  already  have 
participation  in  the  International  Maritime  Organization.  The 
Coast Guard is doing bilateral discussions right now with the Rus-
sians  about  the  Bering  Strait,  sometimes  now  referred  as  the  Ber-
ing  Gate.  But,  something  to  consider  is  the  fact  that  we  can  prob-
ably  agree  fairly  quickly  on  new  rules  for  the  Arctic,  but  the  issue 
is  new  investment  needed  for  the  Arctic,  as  well,  that  we  have  co-
ordinated  investment  in  the  St.  Lawrence  Seaway,  for  example, 
and that may be something the Nation wants to look at in the Arc-
tic with other nations. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Thank  you  very  much  for  the  hearing,  Mr. 
Chairman. I really think that until Americans wake up to the fact 
that  we’re  sending  out  our  capital  overseas  to  buy  oil  we  could 
produce  here  at  home,  we’re  not  going  to  see  the  capital  formation 
that’s  necessary  to  make  the  changes  that  all  of  you  agree  seems 
to  be  necessary  in  our  transportation  system.  I  just  don’t  see  the 
ability  to  add  the  cost  of  this  change  on  the  taxpayers.  It  should 
come  from  increased  revenue  from  activity  in  the  United  States  of 
producing our own oil and gas. 

Everyone  talks  about  how  much  we’ll  save  at  the  pump.  They 
don’t understand, the real savings comes from the job creation and 
the  increased  activity  in  this  country  that  would  come  from  pro-
ducing our own supply of oil and gas. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate it. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Thank you. 
Senator STEVENS. I do have some questions I’d like to submit for 

the record, but I have to go to another—— 

Senator LAUTENBERG. I agree. I would just take a moment to re-
spond  to  my  eloquent  friend  from  Alaska  and  say  that  the  full 
measure  of  the  cost  of  getting  more  material  from  those  sources  is 
not  simply  the  cost  for  the  material—oil,  in  particular—but  our 
costs  for  then  protecting  these  states  and  their  governments,  and 
the cost is substantially higher. And I think that if we continue to 
want  to  compete  there,  then  the  costs  for  fuel  is  going  to  go  sub-
stantially  higher  than  it  is  now,  and  presents  the  question  for  us. 

Senator Thune?

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA 

Senator  THUNE.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  thank  you  for 
holding  this—thank  the  Chair  and  the  Vice  Chair  for  holding  the 
hearing  on  the  impact  of  the  transportation  sector  on  climate 
change, and vice versa. 

I  think  it’s  important  that,  whenever  you  talk  about  the  topic  of 
transportation’s impact on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas 
emissions,  to  start  with  the  energy  bill  of  2007.  In  addition  to  the 
historic  increase  in  vehicle  fuel  efficiency  standards  and  other  en-
ergy  efficiency  programs,  the  bill  also  included  an  expanded  Re-
newable Fuel Standard. 

The  2007  energy  bill  requires  the  use  of  36  billion  gallons  of  re-
newable  fuel  by  the  year  2022,  and  it  also  includes  significant  re-
quirements  for  life-cycle  greenhouse  gas  emission  reductions.  In 
fact,  under  the  bill,  new  corn  ethanol  plants  must  product  ethanol 
with  a  20  percent  reduction  in  life-cycle  greenhouse  gas  emissions. 
And  when  you  start  talking  about  advanced  biofuel  and  cellulosic 
ethanol, which constitutes the majority of the new Renewable Fuel 
Standard,  those  have  to  have  a  50  percent  reduction  and  60  per-
cent  reduction  in  life-cycle  greenhouse  gas  emissions  relative  to 
regular gasoline. 

So, this was a landmark piece of legislation that I don’t think can 
be  overlooked.  We  need  to  start  discussing  the  transportation  sec-
tor’s  impact  on  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  And  moving  forward, 
we’ve  got  to  continue  to  meet  the  challenges  of  high  fuel  costs  and 
greenhouse  gas  emissions  with  commonsense  policies  that  reduce 
those  emissions  while,  at  the  same  time,  helping  U.S.  businesses 
stay competitive, keep our economy growing and family budgets in-
tact. 

So, I wanted to make that general observation with regard to the 
RFS, but I guess I’d like to, more specifically, ask a couple of ques-
tions  of  the  panel,  and  maybe  get  a  reaction  in  terms  of—and  I’d 
direct this, I guess, to Mr. Meenan, to start with—but, if there was 
a  policy  that  we  could  put  in  place,  what’s  the  single  most  impor-
tant  policy  this  Committee  could  pursue  that  would  help  with  air-
line  industry—the  increase  in  fuel  costs  that  you’re  dealing  with, 
with  fuel  efficiency,  trying  to  lower  your  fuel  bills  and  decrease 
greenhouse  gas  emissions?  That’s  something—we  all  see  the  spike 
in everything in the economy right now, but airline ticket fares are 
no exception—I know, driven by the high cost of fuel. Any thoughts 
about that? 

Mr. MEENAN. Senator, without any question. The subject was ad-
dressed  yesterday  by  Northwest’s  Chairman  and  CEO  in  his  testi-
mony up here. We believe that getting after some of the speculative 
pressure in the oil market would be the most direct and immediate 
means  of  driving  some  of  that  cost  out  of  the  price  of  a  barrel,  at 
this  point.  Experts  in  the  field  say  that  it  could  drive  the  price 
down  as  much  as  $40–$50  at  a  single  sweep.  Even  assuming  that 
that  may  be  an  exaggeration—even  $20,  even  $5  would  be  a 
marked  improvement  from  where  we  are  today.  We  see  no  risk  in 
getting  after  a  little  bit  more  regulation,  a  little  bit  more  focus  on 
what’s  going  on  in  that  market  today.  As  you  know,  we’re  trading 
as many as 20 paper barrels of oil for every single barrel of actual

product  that’s  used.  That  suggests  to  us  that  there’s  a  lot  of  froth 
in  the  market  that  might  be  reduced  by  getting  after  the  specula-
tive pressures. 

Senator  THUNE.  Does  your  organization—have  they  taken  any 
kind  of  position  on—specific  piece  of  legislation  or  way  of  going 
about  doing—I  know  a  number  of  proposals  that  are  swirling 
around out there. 

Mr.  MEENAN.  Senator,  we’re  working  with  a  number  of  different 
members  who  are  proposing  a  variety  of  different  measures.  And 
right now we’re trying to, sort of, hone in on whatever the most ef-
fective  vehicle  will  be,  and  go  with  that.  But,  it’s—the  debate  is 
still swirling, at this point, but I—we’re hopeful it’s going to get re-
solved in the next few days, if at all possible. 

Senator  THUNE.  Anybody  else  care  to  comment  on  that?  I  know 
I  directed  it  to  the  aviation  industry,  but  any,  just,  general 
thoughts about specific remedies that Congress could pursue that— 
policies that would help address—— 

Mr. HAMBERGER. To the availability and price of fuel? 
Senator THUNE. Yes. 
Mr.  HAMBERGER.  I  don’t  know  how  my  friend  to  the  right  will 
react to this, but are part of a coalition pushing coal-to-liquids, and 
believe that that would certainly provide both a domestic and a re-
liable source at a reasonable rate. 

right. 

Senator  THUNE.  Yes,  if—maybe,  direct  this  to  your  friend  to  the 

[Laughter.] 
Senator THUNE. My left, your right. 
But, with respect to the whole issue of the RFS and biofuels and 
everything  else,  how  do  you  see  the—sort  of,  the  movement  of  the 
next-generation  biofuel,  cellulosic  ethanol,  as—with  respect  to  how 
it will contribute to reducing CO2 emissions and the broader issue, 
I  suppose,  of  climate  change,  but  the  impact  that  that  might  have 
on  our  transportation  infrastructure  if  we  move  more  to  biofuels? 

Mr. FRIEDMAN. Thank you, Senator. 
I  expect  that  the  potential  is  out  there  for  the  sustainable  pro-
duction of maybe 40–50 billion gallons of biofuels over the next 30, 
40,  50  years,  significantly  less  than  some  people  are  pointing  to. 
But,  one  of  the  most  important  things  we  have  to  realize  is  that, 
as we tackle global warming pollution, as we tackle oil dependence, 
we need to make sure we’re not creating any tradeoffs between the 
two.  We  need  to  focus  our  research,  our  incentives  on  the  best  of 
the  biofuels,  the  cleanest  of  the  biofuels.  We  also  need  to  do  the 
same when it comes to any fuel. 

When it comes to coal-to-liquids, look, if coal-to-liquids can get a 
dramatic  reduction  in  global  warming  pollution,  the  same  as  re-
newable  electricity,  then  it  belongs  in  the  mix.  Right  now,  all  the 
data  shows  that  making  liquid  coal  can  potentially  double  global 
warming pollution. 

So—but,  as  long  as  we  have  a  fuel  policy  based  on  performance 
standards  and  incentives  based  on  greenhouse  gas  performance 
standards,  I  don’t  think  we  have  to  have  these  big  debates  over 
which fuel is the best, which fuel is the worst. As long as we guide 
the  performance,  the  market  is  going  to  figure  out  which  are  the 
most cost-effective options out there.

We  also  have  to  remember  that  the  Renewable  Fuel  Standard 
isn’t  enough.  It  really  only  covers  about  10  percent  of  the  market. 
That’s  why  we  need  to  move  to  something  like  a  low-carbon  fuel 
standard to broaden out what we’re doing. 

Senator THUNE. But, the RFS does have—— 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Senator,  may  I  ask,  how  much  more  do 
you  have?  We  are  going  to  keep  the  record  open  for  questions,  if 
we could wrap it up. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator THUNE. Thank you for that not-so-subtle hint. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator LAUTENBERG. That’s how I got to be Chairman. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  THUNE.  Well,  it’ll  get  us  both  to  lunch,  I  guess,  but—— 
[Laughter.] 
Senator THUNE. I will, I’ll submit any other questions I have for 

the record. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. If you have one more—— 
Senator  THUNE.  No,  that’s  all  right.  I  just  wanted  to  ask—I 

guess, in—just as a quick follow-up on—— 

Would  you  all  not  concede,  however,  that  the  RFS,  inasmuch  as 
it  is  only—we  say  we  use  140  billion  gallons  of  fuel  every  year  in 
this  country—even  if  we  get  to  36  billion  gallons,  21  billion  of 
which will be cellulosic—that that is going to have a significant im-
pact  because  of  the  requirements  we  imposed  in  the  Renewable 
Fuel  Standard  on  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  life-cycle 
greenhouse  gas  emissions—that  that’s  going  to  have  a  positive  im-
pact? 

Mr. FRIEDMAN. Great question. And the portion of the Renewable 
Fuel  Standard  that  does  have  greenhouse  gas  standards,  I  think, 
will have a clear and positive effect. One of the challenges, though, 
is  that  on  the  order  of  13  to  14  billion  gallons  of  corn  ethanol  re-
mains  completely  unregulated  when  it  comes  to  global  warming 
pollution.  It  was  grandfathered  in  as  part  of  the  Renewable  Fuel 
Standard. 

Honestly,  if  you  look  at  the  potential  land-use  impacts  and  in-
creased  global  warming  pollution  from  some  of  those  fuels,  we 
could  end  up  with  only  a  very  small  benefit  from  the  Renewable 
Fuel  Standard,  as  written.  This  is  why,  again,  we  need  to  eventu-
ally  move  beyond  turning  food  into  fuels,  even  just  simply  for  cli-
mate  reasons.  And  this  Committee,  I  think,  has  a  role  to  play  in 
all of these things. 

One of the other things I definitely want to urge this Committee 
to do is to exercise its oversight powers, as well, on the Department 
of  Transportation  to  make  sure  that  our  upcoming  fuel  economy 
standards are as strong as they can be. 

Senator THUNE. Thank you. 
Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  the  panel  for  your  testimony. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thank you. 
With  that,  we  thank  you  again,  to  the  witnesses,  and  we’ll  keep 

Appreciate it.

A P P E N D I X 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. BARBARA BOXER, U.S. SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA 
The transportation sector is a significant contributor to global warming. 
Approximately  33  percent  of  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  in  the  United 
States come from transportation. And 72 percent of the transportation sector’s emis-
sions are generated by road use. 

The movement of goods has a real impact on air quality and global warming emis-
sions. Freight transportation still largely relies on fossil fuels and consequently pro-
duces significant greenhouse gas emissions. 

As  a  percentage  of  all  mobile  source  emissions,  heavy-duty  truck,  rail,  and  water 
transport  together  account  for  more  than  25  percent  of  CO2 emissions,  approxi-
mately  50  percent  of  NOX emissions,  and  nearly  40  percent  of  particulate  (PM) 
emissions in the United States. 

My  home  state  of  California  has  long  suffered  from  air  quality  problems  from 
transportation  emissions.  According  to  the  California  Air  Resources  Board  (CARB), 
approximately 75 percent of diesel particulate emissions in California are related to 
goods movement. 

In addition, CARB has attributed 2,400 premature deaths to diesel emissions and 
estimates  that  the  health  costs  of  diesel  emissions  could  be  as  high  as  $200  billion 
in 2020. 

The movement of people and goods is vital to our economy, but it clogs our roads, 

fouls our air, pollutes our water, and creates safety issues. 

For example, idling in traffic congestion is a tremendous source of carbon dioxide 
emissions and fuel. Billions of gallons of fuel are burned by vehicles stuck in traffic. 
This  type  of  congestion  stifles  our  economy  and  uses  our  energy  resources  and  pro-
duces greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming. 

Through  the  use  of  traffic  signal  timing  and  other  technologies  we  can  reduce 

idling, which can make a significant contribution to reducing GHG emissions. 

In  addition,  we  can  help  reduce  congestion  and  the  growth  of  highway  demand 
by shifting trips to other modes of travel. Making more trips by biking, walking, car-
pooling, and reducing the number of trips necessary, by telecommuting, for example, 
could help reduce GHG emissions as well. 

A combination of strategies including land use and increased public transit rider-

ship could significantly reduce transportation-related CO2 emissions. 

By reducing congestion we can also improve the quality or the air we breathe and 

improve public health. 

However,  in  addition  to  working  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  to  limit  future  warm-
ing, we also need to prepare our transportation system to withstand the unavoidable 
impacts of global warming. 

Recent studies by the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of 
Sciences and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) underscore the need for 
adaptation planning at the state and local levels. 

Six of the Nation’s top ten freight gateways, which are centers for economic activ-

ity, will be at risk if sea levels rise. 

60,000  miles  of  coastal  highways  already  experience  coastal  storm  flooding  and 
wave  action.  This  number  is  certain  to  increase  with  rising  the  sea  levels,  leaving 
communities vulnerable to ocean waves and cutting off evacuation routes. 

Climate change will have significant impacts on transportation, affecting the way 
U.S.  transportation  interests  plan,  design,  construct,  operate,  and  maintain  infra-
structure. 

That’s  why  I  am  pleased  the  Committee  is  holding  this  hearing  to  examine  the 

impacts of climate change on the transportation sector. 

I thank the Chairman for holding this important hearing. We are looking at these 
issues  in  the  Environment  and  Public  Works  Committee  as  well.  A  cap  and  trade 
system to control carbon pollution could provide substantial revenue to address car-
bon emissions in the transportation sector. 

I look forward to hearing from the witnesses before us today.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN MARY ANN SCHAFFER,  CHAIRPERSON,  AVIATION 
SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENT TASK FORCE,  AIR LINE PILOTS ASSOCIATION, 
INTERNATIONAL 
On  behalf  of  the  54,000  airline  pilots  represented  by  the  Air  Line  Pilots  Associa-
tion, International (ALPA), I am pleased to offer this testimony to the Senate Com-
merce  Committee.  We  appreciate  the  Committee’s  interest  in  climate  change  and 
the  impacts  on  the  transportation  sector  and  are  pleased  to  share  our  perspective. 
It  may  not  be  apparent  why  ALPA  would  have  an  interest  in  this  subject,  so  I 
will  explain.  ALPA’s  motto,  since  its  beginning  almost  77  years  ago,  has  been 
‘‘Schedule with Safety.’’ A former FAA Administrator and others have dubbed ALPA 
the  ‘‘conscience  of  the  airline  industry’’  and  in  that  role,  we  take  very  seriously  the 
need  to  ensure  that  any  new  operational  measures  are  fully  understood  and  thor-
oughly  considered  before  implementation.  Pilots  literally  sit  at  the  intersection  of 
new  technology,  operational  measures,  air  traffic  control  procedures,  and  varying 
aircraft capabilities. This gives us a unique vantage point to see and experience first 
hand  what  well-intended,  but  unrealistic  operational  procedures  can  do  to  safety 
margins.1 

Another principal reason for our interest in this subject is the need to ensure the 
ongoing viability, what we call the sustainability, of our airline industry. We recog-
nize  all  too  well  that  our  employers  are  under  tremendous  financial  stress  due  to 
the  record  high  cost  of  fuel  and  pressures  from  environmental  concerns  to  reduce 
fuel consumption and corresponding emissions. Pilots have a genuine ability to help 
their  airlines  burn  less  fuel,  and  thereby  put  less  noise  and  tailpipe  emissions  into 
the  environment.  Pilots  look  for  opportunities  to  reduce  fuel  burn  and  do  so  every 
day. 

Pilots and the airline industry as a whole have already made great strides toward 
reducing  total  fuel  burn,  noise,  and  tailpipe  emissions.  We  believe  Congress  should 
take  this  into  account  when  it  considers  any  legislation  regarding  greenhouse  gas 
(GHG)  emissions.  I  will  discuss  later  the  extraordinary  investments  that  our  em-
ployers have made to reduce consumption and pollution. 

With oil peaking near $140 per barrel, airlines are parking airplanes because they 
can no longer afford to fly them, name-brand legacy carriers are looking for mergers 
in order to survive, airlines are spending about 40 percent of their revenues on fuel, 
and  airline  pilots  are  facing  an  uncertain  future  in  an  industry  unstable  because 
of  this  energy  crisis.  Already  this  year,  four  carriers  have  shut  down  entirely  and 
more than 14,000 airline jobs have been eliminated. 

Airlines  and  aviation  face  unique  challenges.  First  are  the  long  and  expensive 
lead  times  for  the  research,  development,  design,  and  certification  implementation 
for new technologies. Second is the lack of any economically viable alternative to fos-
sil-based fuel. Compounding these issues is the lack of a comprehensive national en-
ergy policy that addresses the short and long term needs of our transportation sys-
tems. 
ALPA’s Work to Improve the Environment 

As  evidenced  by  the  creation  of  our  President’s  Task  Force  on  Aviation  Sustain-
ability  and  Environment,  ALPA  takes  environmental  concerns  very  seriously.  We 
are, and will continue to be, part of the solution as evidenced by the following activi-
ties: 

• ALPA is participating in the work of Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuel Ini-
tiative (CAAFI), which involves the airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and the sci-
entific  community  collaborating  to  find  new  and  better  sources  of  fuel  for  avia-
tion. 

• We are also a member of the Advisory Board for the Partnership for Air Trans-
portation  Noise  and  Emissions  Reduction  (PARTNER)  effort  and  the  FAA’s 
Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) Environmental Working Group. 
• Our  most  recent  success  story:  ALPA  was  a  principal  co-sponsor  of  a  two-day 
conference  for  more  than  200  government  and  industry  participants  in  March, 
called  Aviation  and  the  Environment:  A  Primer  for  North  American  Stake-
holders. The purpose of the forum was threefold: 

1 For example, a recently designed descent path into a major east coast airport required pilots 
to cross closely spaced points at successively lower altitudes. The points were too close together 
to  allow  pilots  to  meet  the  restrictions  using  advanced  aircraft  navigation  computers  resulting 
in increased pilot workload in a critical phase of flight. The procedure was revised based on pilot 
and controller feedback.

1. Put the environment debate into context and educate the members of the co- 
hosting associations on the basic facts. 
2. Examine some of the policy options, measures and decisions proposed to cur-
tail and reduce overall noise and emissions. 
3. Provide a platform to communicate aviation’s already impressive gains in the 
reduction of noise and emissions and highlight ongoing industry environmental 
initiatives. 

Safety and Operations 

Airline  pilots  can,  and  do,  save  fuel  and  emissions  through  operating  techniques. 
Safety  is  our  utmost  concern,  of  course,  but  where  safety  is  not  impacted,  airline 
pilots will reduce fuel usage through such measures as: 

• Single-engine  outbound  taxi—Under  certain  conditions,  it  is  not  necessary  that 
all aircraft engines be operated to taxi on the ramp or on taxiways. When condi-
tions  permit,  only  one  engine  may  be  started  out  of  two  or  more  available  en-
gines until reaching the end of the runway for takeoff. 
• Engine  shut-down  during  inbound  taxi—Once  the  aircraft  has  exited  the  land-
ing  runway  and  is  headed  to  the  gate  or  parking  stand,  one  or  more  operating 
engines  may  be  shut  down  either  in  the  taxiway  environment  or  on  the  ramp. 
• Technology  enhanced  departure  procedures—New  procedures  are  being  devel-
oped  with  the  aid  of  Area  Navigation  (RNAV)  and  Required  Navigation  Per-
formance (RNP) technology which permit shortening the distance and time trav-
eled during approach and departure. 
• Optimal  altitude—Each  jet  aircraft,  based  on  weight  and  ambient  conditions, 
has an optimum altitude where fuel burn is minimized. To the extent that con-
ditions  and  circumstances  permit,  pilots  may  request  that  optimal  altitude  in 
order to conserve fuel, which reduces emissions. 
• Optimal-speed  flight  plans—Planning  and  operating  a  flight  at  an  efficient 
speed  can  save  fuel.  Pilots  can  optimize  fuel  burn  based  on  aircraft  weight, 
winds, and atmospheric conditions. 
• Continuous  Descent  Arrival  (CDA)/Optimized  Descent  Procedure  (OPD)—Nor-
mal  approach  and  landing  procedures  require  an  aircraft  to  reduce  power,  de-
scend  to  a  new  altitude,  and  then  add  considerable  power  to  level  off  and  fly 
straight  and  level—that  process  may  be  repeated  several  times  during  any  ap-
proach  and  landing.  A  new  approach  procedure,  the  CDA,  or  what  we  refer  to 
as  an  OPD,  is  being  developed  that  permits  pilots  to  reduce  power  on  all  en-
gines  and  not  use  significant  thrust  until  safety  concerns  dictate  establishing 
a  stabilized  approach  configuration  just  before  landing.  This  procedure  cannot 
work at all airports at all times due to operational constraints, but at those lo-
cations where it can be used, it can save substantial fuel on a single approach. 
• Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM)—Taking advantage of improved 
technology,  appropriately  equipped  aircraft  can  now  fly  with  1,000  feet—com-
pared  with  2,000  feet  previously—vertical  separation  at  higher  altitudes.  This 
operational  change  added  six  additional  useable  altitudes  increasing  the  oppor-
tunity  for  pilots  to  fly  their  aircraft  at  the  optimal,  most  fuel  efficient  altitude, 
in addition to permitting much greater airspace utilization. 

Aviation’s Enviable Environmental Record 

Aviation arguably has the most successful record of limiting its impact on the en-
vironment  while  increasing  its  productivity  of  any  industrial  sector.  Airlines  have 
greatly  reduced  carbon-based  emissions  through  engine  technology  which  reduces 
fuel  burn  and  emission  of  undesirable  gases  and  particulates.  Compared  to  aircraft 
in use in 1972, the U.S. airline industry now carries six (6) times more payload using 
60 percent less fuel and has reduced by 95 percent the number of people significantly 
impacted  by  aircraft  noise.2 This  outstanding  record  of  environmental  achievement 
has  resulted  almost  entirely  from  the  airlines  continually  demanding  new  aircraft 
from  the  manufacturers  that  burn  less  fuel,  carry  greater  payloads,  and  create  less 
noise.  Boeing  is  preparing  for  the  first  flight  of  the  B–787;  due  to  its  cutting  edge 
technology, that aircraft is designed to use 20 percent less fuel—and thereby create 
20 percent less GHG emissions—than current aircraft of the same size. This aircraft 
is  just  one  example  of  the  kinds  of  investments  that  the  airlines  make  in  a  very

heavily capitalized industry; those investments should be taken into account by any 
legislation that deals with fuel conservation and GHG emissions. 
Recommendations 

As described, the airline industry has already made great progress toward reduc-
ing  GHG  emissions  without  the  creation  of  a  new  commodity  market  that  would 
funnel its assets to other industries and entities.3 That said, the industry does need 
your help to boost our great progress: 

• Provide  sufficient  and  timely  funding  to  the  FAA  for  necessary  improvements 
in the U.S. National Aviation System (NAS). Funding the national airspace sys-
tem  modernization  components  needed  to  enhance  aircraft  efficiency,  safety, 
and capacity will help in reducing delays, fuel consumption, and emissions. Im-
plementation  of  the  Next  Generation  Air  Transportation  System  (NEXTGEN) 
could eliminate as much as 15 percent of today’s delays, increase safety and ca-
pacity, and concurrently reduce emissions. Funding important studies like wake 
vortex  investigations  will  also  help.  More  information  and  understanding  of 
wake  vortex  patterns  around  runways  will  allow  spacing  of  traffic  on  the  run-
way  based  on  real  hazards—a  more  accurate  standard  than  the  currently  used 
mileage separation. 

• Continue  funding  for  important  infrastructure  improvements  including  runway 
and  taxiway  additions  and  improvements.  Poor  airport  design,  including  those 
with  intersecting  runways,  increases  taxi  time  and  increases  fuel  use.  Adding 
high-speed taxiway exits from runways can reduce runway occupancy time thus 
increasing  airport  capacity.  Additional  runways,  like  those  in  progress  at  Se-
attle-Tacoma  and  Washington  Dulles  airports,  reduce  fuel  wasted  in  holding 
patterns and long lines of aircraft waiting for take-off. 

• Give greater support to research for alternative fuels which are renewable, pol-
lute less or not at all, and are less expensive than today’s fuels. Because of air-
craft  engine  design  and  extreme  atmospheric  conditions  at  altitude,  the  airline 
industry relies entirely on petroleum-based fuels; it cannot currently substitute 
ethanol or other fuels as some industries are able to do. 

• Avoid  adding  economic  burdens,  in  the  form  of  market-based  measures,  to  an 
already  crippled  industry.  Such  measures  as  planned  to  take  effect  in  Europe 
and proposed in the Lieberman-Warner bill are biased against the airline indus-
try and do not provide sufficient re-investment of revenue for new aviation tech-
nologies  and  fuel.  These  carbon  cap-and-trade  schemes  are  designed  to  provide 
an economic incentive to reduce emissions—our industry already has that incen-
tive  and  is  continually  searching  for  more  ways  to  reduce  fuel  use  and  emis-
sions.  Diverting  funds  needed  for  new,  more  fuel  efficient  aircraft  and  alter-
native fuels research will only slow these efforts. 
• Work  with  the  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  to  establish 
emissions standards and operating measures for uniform application across this 
global industry. 

Conclusion 

Aviation is a good news story; we safely move hundreds of millions of passengers 
around  the  world  in  comfort,  at  great  speed,  and  with  less  impact  on  the  environ-
ment than any other mode of transportation in history. However, aviation is a visi-
ble  target  and  has  drawn  the  attention  of  numerous  groups  around  the  world  who 
condemn the industry for being a driver of projected climate change. 

As  pilots,  we  deal  with  facts,  and  the  facts  clearly  show  that  while  aviation  is  a 
contributor of greenhouse gas and other emissions, it plays only a small role in the 
overall  issue.  Indeed,  we  could  ground  the  entire  world’s  fleet,  and  not  have  a  sig-
nificant  effect  on  the  climate  change  issue.  The  industry  is  poised  to  make  great 
strides  in  reducing  emissions  through  technology  and  operating  procedures.  We  be-
lieve that the best way to achieve those results is the same way that we have made 
such  great  advances  thus  far,  namely,  through  industry’s  investments  in  increas-
ingly advanced technology. 

Thank  you  again  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today.  We  urge  Congress’  support 

of our ongoing and future efforts to reduce aviation’s environmental impacts. 

3 The  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  held  a  2-day  conference  June  18–19  in  Mon-
treal  to  discuss  carbon  markets  and  their  application  to  aviation.  These  voluntary  and  manda-
tory  markets  are  maturing  around  the  world  and  stand  ready  to  envelop  the  aviation  industry 
in a commodities market for carbon that will divert needed financing from true fuel savings ini-
tiatives.

RAILWAY SUPPLY INSTITUTE, INC. 

Washington, DC, June 30, 2008 

Hon. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 
Chairman, 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 
Washington, DC. 
RE:  JUNE 24,  2008,  FULL COMMITTEE HEARING ON ‘‘CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON 

THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR’’ 

Dear Mr. Chairman, 

The Railway Supply Institute appreciates the opportunity to submit comments to 
the Committee for the record on the contributions of the transportation sector to ad-
dress  climate  change,  and  the  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  on  the  Nation’s 
transportation infrastructure. 

Established in 1908, RSI is the international trade association of the rail and rail 
rapid  transit  supply  industry.  We  have  over  200  members  who  provide  goods  and 
services  to  our  Nation’s  freight  and  passenger  railroads  as  well  as  our  rail  transit 
systems.  RSI  estimates  that  the  domestic  railway  supply  industry  approaches  $25 
billion in annual revenues and employs 150,000 people. 

Many  Americans  are  still  trying  to  understand  what  climate  change  is  and  what 
needs to be done to address it. What Americans do understand is the cost of oil and 
the  penalties  we  all  must  pay  for  being  overly  dependent  on  foreign  oil.  The  fact 
remains that the more we can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels the more likely 
we are to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that impact climate change. 

Transportation  consumes  7  out  of  every  10  barrels  of  oil  consumed  in  the  United 
States. Highway transportation dominates both energy use and GHG emissions, ac-
counting  for  72  percent  of  transportation  energy  use  and  carbon  emissions  in  the 
Nation.  The  United  States  transportation  system  is  the  largest  in  the  world,  is  a 
major source of global GHG emissions, and is almost entirely responsible for our Na-
tion’s dependence on oil as the major source of energy. While the United States has 
only 4.5 percent of the world’s population, it uses 25 percent of the world’s oil. About 
60  percent  of  U.S.  oil  is  imported.  Clearly  this  suggests  that  until  we  have  alter-
native  fuels  that  can  be  economically  employed  on  a  wider  scale,  we  must  depend 
more on encouraging the development of the most efficient modes of transportation. 
In turn, that will help us achieve a reduction in GHG emissions. 

Rail  transportation  is  efficient  and  we  need  to  focus  more  attention  on  investing 
in  rail  as  a  way  to  fight  GHG  emissions,  reduce  vehicle  miles  travelled  (VMT)  and 
improve  fuel  efficiency.  The  transportation  investments  made  now  will  impact  fu-
ture  transportation,  environmental  and  social  investments  so  we  need  to  start  get-
ting  these  decisions  right.  Robert  Puentes  of  the  Brookings  Institution  has  sug-
gested  that  ‘‘America’s  transportation  policy  is  adrift  with  no  clear  goals,  purpose, 
or ability to meet today’s challenges’’. He suggests that policymakers are too focused 
on highways and transit and have ignored passenger and freight rail which may be 
part  of  the  solution  to  addressing  other  key  policy  issues  (such  as  dependence  on 
foreign oil, congestion and climate change). 

Increased passenger rail should be part of the transportation modal shift required 
to address the proliferation of greenhouse gas production, while maintaining mobil-
ity.  Furthermore,  a  strong,  national  railroad  infrastructure  helps  to  achieve  some 
of our Nation’s critical policy objectives: 

• reducing carbon emissions; 
• reducing congestion on our highways; 
• improving transportation safety; 
• reducing airport congestion; 
• efficiently utilize land for transportation purposes 
• reducing dependence on foreign oil; and, 
• enhancing our ability to move vast numbers of people in emergency evacuation 

situations (e.g., 9/11 or Katrina). 

The 1973 events in the Middle East, which the French refer to as the ‘‘oil shock’’ 
changed  the  way  of  life  for  many  in  that  country.  The  price  of  oil  quadrupled  and 
French  policymakers  saw  only  one  way  out  for  France—energy  independence.  The 
thought of being dependent for energy on a volatile region of the world such as the 
Middle  East  disturbed  many  French  people.  In  the  1970s,  the  French  decided  that 
they could no longer afford to have an economy so dependent on imported oil. 

Now  the  U.S.  is  facing  a  2008  ‘‘oil  shock’’  and  the  answer  is  not  to  manipulate 
the  cost  of  oil  downward  or  drill  for  more  oil  offshore  as  some  have  suggested.  No,

100 

the  answer  is  energy  independence  first  through  utilizing  the  most  efficient  modes 
of transportation and then through alternative energy sources. 

While  we  may  argue  over  the  method  employed  by  the  French—higher  oil  taxes 
and  a  move  to  nuclear  energy—there  is  no  arguing  over  their  strategy  to  stop  de-
pending on imported oil to fuel their economy. 

Today,  the  French  are  energy  independent  and  are  among  the  world  leaders  in 
lowering  GHG  emissions.  One  of  the  ways  they  have  achieved  this  is  by  investing 
in  electric  high  speed  rail  corridors  throughout  the  country.  Meanwhile  the  U.S. 
struggles  with  its  addiction  to  oil  and  stands  by  idly  as  others  develop  energy  effi-
cient and carbon friendly high speed rail systems. 

We know that the high cost of fuel in Europe and Asia has promoted development 
of high speed rail and the results have demonstrated that once reliable and conven-
ient rail passenger service is available it begins to impact mode-shifting away from 
the  higher  carbon  producing  modes,  particularly  as  the  cost  of  auto  and  air  travel 
increase. 

Cost  alone  is  not  the  true  measure  of  our  transportation  policy.  There  is  a  cost 
of  carbon,  a  cost  of  congestion  and  a  very  high  cost  of  having  a  transportation  sys-
tem  that  is  overly  dependent  on  foreign  oil.  Transportation  policy  must  focus  on  a 
reduction  in  vehicle  miles  travelled  (VMT),  less  dependence  on  foreign  oil,  lower 
greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions,  alternative  to  short  distance  air  travel,  reduction 
in congestion and realistic alternatives to driving. 

Finally,  it  is  important  to  note  that  2  years  ago  the  Center  for  Clean  Air  Policy 
and  the  Center  for  Neighborhood  Technology  released  a  report  on  High  Speed  Rail 
and  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions  in  the  U.S.  This  report  used  the  11  federally  des-
ignated  high  speed  rail  corridors  in  the  U.S.  to  estimate  the  annual  GHG  benefits 
if  these  high  speed  rail  systems  were  developed  as  planned.  The  report  concluded 
that high speed rail development in these corridors ‘‘will generate substantial GHG 
savings  in  all  regions’’.  All  the  evidence  on  fuel  efficiency  and  carbon  emissions 
points to the need to begin implementing these corridors now. We know what needs 
to be done and we need to find the will to do it. 

Thank you for the opportunity to present our views. 

Sincerely, 

THOMAS D. SIMPSON, 

Executive Director—Washington. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF STEPHEN A. ALTERMAN, PRESIDENT, 

CARGO AIRLINE ASSOCIATION 

My  name  is  Steve  Alterman  and  I  am  President  of  the  Cargo  Airline  Association 
(‘‘the  Association’’  or  CAA),  the  organization  representing  the  interests  of  the  lead-
ing U.S. all-cargo air carriers before Congress, Federal administrative agencies and 
the  various  states  and  localities  throughout  the  United  States.1 I  also  have  the 
honor  of  being  the  current  Chairman  of  the  Environmental  Subcommittee  of  the 
FAA’s  Research,  Engineering  and  Development  Advisory  Committee  (REDAC).  On 
behalf  of  our  air  carrier  association  members,  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  com-
ment briefly on aviation’s place in the debate over global climate change. 

Initially, it is important to note that the all-cargo airline industry, and indeed the 
aviation  community  generally,  has  a  record  of  achievement  that  clearly  dem-
onstrates  a  commitment  to  environmental  sensitivity.  For  example,  comparing  the 
year 2007 with the year 2000, U.S. commercial airlines consumed 3 percent less fuel 
in  2007,  while  at  the  same  time  transporting  over  20  percent  more  passengers  and 
cargo.  Moreover,  between  the  years  1978  and  2007,  fuel  efficiency  has  improved  by 
110 percent.2 Therefore, the aviation sector of the economy has been able to stabilize 
its contribution to total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at approximately 2 percent 
of  the  total  GHG  emissions  in  the  United  States.3 While  this  record  is  enviable,  it 
cannot and should not end the discussion of the future course of the climate change 
debate in the United States. 

For their part, U.S. airlines are not simply resting on their past accomplishments. 
As noted in the statement submitted to the Committee by John Meenan, Executive 

1 U.S. air carrier members of the Cargo Airline Association are ABX Air, Air Transport Inter-

national, Atlas Air, Capital Cargo, FedEx Express, Kalitta Air and UPS Airlines. 

2 Although  not  directly  related  to  the  global  climate  change  debate,  it  is  also  significant  that 
the  industry’s  commitment  to  noise  abatement  has  resulted  in  over  a  90  percent  reduction  in 
the population exposed to significant aircraft noise since 1978. 

3 In  contrast,  electric  utilities  contribute  over  a  third  of  the  total  GHGs  and  the  ‘‘emissions’’ 

of cattle and other livestock contributes approximately 18 percent.

Vice  President  and  Chief  Operating  Officer  of  the  Air  Transport  Association  (ATA) 
on  June  24,  2008,  ATA  member  airlines  have  already  committed  to  an  additional 
30  percent  system-wide  fuel  efficiency  by  the  year  2025.  The  major  cargo  carriers 
are included in this commitment and Cargo Airline Association members have been 
in  the  forefront  of  developing  and  implementing  new  operational  procedures  and 
technologies  that  will  increase  efficiency  and  decrease  fuel  burn.  These  efforts  will 
continue  as  the  industry  continually  upgrades  its  aircraft  fleet  and  works  with  the 
manufacturing sector on airframe and engine technology and with the Federal Gov-
ernment on a new generation of more environmentally sensitive aviation fuels. 

At  the  same  time,  the  industry  alone  cannot  achieve  the  enhancements  that  will 
be  necessary  in  the  coming  years—especially  in  the  current  chaotic  airline  environ-
ment.4 Rather, both the legislative and administrative branches of government must 
recognize both the past achievements and future challenges in fashioning a program 
to ensure that the airline community meets its environmental goals—goals based on 
sound environmental science balanced with the operational realities of the air trans-
portation  system.  If  there  were  any  doubt  that  Congress  is  fully  engaged  in  the 
issue  of  global  climate  change,  that  doubt  should  be  erased  in  reviewing  the  re-
cently-introduced Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act (S. 3036).5 However, this 
proposed legislation would only exacerbate an already untenable position in the air-
line  community.  While  not  directly  addressing  the  airline  industry,  the  provisions 
of  this  bill  would  impose  a  substantial  indirect  fuel  tax  that  would  be  paid  to  the 
oil companies and would not in any way address aviation environmental issues.6 

What,  then,  should  Congress  do  to  address  environmental  issues  in  the  aviation 
community? First, it should be recognized that FAA Reauthorization is, among other 
things, an environmental imperative. Quite apart from the ongoing debate over FAA 
funding,  both  the  House  (H.R.  2881)  and  the  Senate  (S.  1300)  reauthorization  bills 
contain a number of environmental initiatives that are necessary if the industry and 
government  are  to  move  forward  to  meet  the  environmental  challenges  of  the  com-
ing  years.7 The  most  far-reaching  program  is  the  proposal  to  establish  a  govern-
ment/industry  consortium  to  develop,  mature  and  certify  ‘‘continuous  lower  energy, 
emissions,  and  noise  engine  and  airframe  technology’’  (CLEEN),  with  the  following 
specific goals to be accomplished by September 30, 2015: 

• Development  of  certifiable  aircraft  technology  that  reduces  greenhouse  gas 
emissions  by  increasing  fuel  efficiency  by  25  percent  relative  to  1997  subsonic 
jet aircraft technology. 
• Development  of  certifiable  engine  technology  that  reduces  landing  and  takeoff 
cycle  nitrogen  oxide  emissions  by  50  percent,  without  increasing  other  gaseous 
or  particle  emissions,  over  the  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  stand-
ard adopted in 2004. 
• Development  of  certifiable  aircraft  technology  that  reduces  noise  levels  by  10 
decibels  at  each  of  the  certification  points  relative  to  1997  subsonic  jet  aircraft 
technology. 
• Determination  of  the  feasibility  of  the  use  of  alternative  fuels  in  aircraft  sys-
tems,  including  successful  demonstration  and  quantification  of  the  benefits  of 
such fuels. 
• Determination of the extent to which new engine and aircraft technologies may 
be used to retrofit or re-engine aircraft to increase the integration of retrofitted 
and  re-engined  aircraft  into  the  commercial  fleet.  See,  Section  602  of  S.  1300. 
In  addition,  the  proposed  legislation  establishes  various  environmentally-based 
pilot  programs  and  permits  airports  to  undertake  studies  and  to  apply  for  grants 
targeted to reducing adverse affects of aviation activity on the environment at their 
airports. Taken together, these initiatives would build on the progress already made 
in reducing the impact of aviation on the environment. 

The  reason  for  detailing  these  prospective  provisions  is  to  emphasize  that  there 
are  ways  that  the  government  and  industry  can  together  address  aviation  environ-
mental  issues  by  recognizing  past  successes  and  building  on  them—without  impos-

4 With fuel prices hovering around the $135 per barrel level, airlines have been forced to take 

drastic action to simply stay in business. 

5 It  appears  that  this  legislation  will  not  move  forward  in  this  session  of  Congress,  but  it  is 

likely that the same or similar legislation will be introduced early in 2009. 

6 The  funds  collected  in  this  manner  would  simply  reimburse  the  oil  companies  for  the  tax 

imposed on them and would not be funneled into aviation projects. 

7 These challenges include, not only managing aviation’s impact on global climate change, but 
also dealing with the continuing issues of aircraft noise and aircraft engine emissions that affect 
local air quality.

ing punitive taxes that would further cripple an already reeling industry. If it is im-
possible  to  enact  a  reauthorization  package  before  the  end  of  the  current  Congress, 
the Association urges the Senate to attempt to find another vehicle that would per-
mit these important environmental provisions to move forward. 

Similarly, the FAA must be ‘‘encouraged’’ to expedite its program to modernize the 
airspace system. While this modernization has its roots in safety, efficiency and ca-
pacity  gains,  it  also  has  a  major  environmental  component.  When  more  direct 
routings and approaches are possible, the immediate result will be less fuel use and 
a  concurrent  reduction  in  all  emissions.  The  Association  is  encouraged  by  the  ap-
pointment  of  a  new  FAA  Senior  Vice  President  for  NextGen  and  Operations  Plan-
ning  and  anticipates  that  this  move  will  lead  to  short-term  gains  that  might  other-
wise be delayed. However, the modernization program in general is a difficult major 
paradigm  shift  in  the  way  traffic  is  managed  and  the  FAA,  industry  and  Congress 
must work together to ensure its success. 

Finally, a unique opportunity may present itself when looking at the interrelation-
ship between FAA Reauthorization and the environmental challenge. In view of the 
current impasse over FAA financing, all parties to the debate should be looking for 
a  compromise  funding  solution.  One  such  possible  compromise  might  have  positive 
environmental  consequences.  If  the  current  excise  tax  system  for  commercial  avia-
tion were eliminated and replaced by an expanded fuel tax, carriers would have the 
incentive  to  save  fuel  by  accelerating  fleet  modernization  and  the  environment 
would benefit in the form of significantly decreased emissions.8 In addition, as noted 
by  the  Department  of  Transportation  Inspector  General  in  a  report  dated  March  3, 
2008,9 ‘‘. . .  we  found  that  jet  fuel  consumption  is  a  better  proxy  for  system  use  of 
the NAS than the current aviation excise taxes . . .’’ 10 

In conclusion, we urge Congress to recognize the environmental record of the avia-
tion industry when taking action in the sphere of global climate change. In addition, 
consideration should be given to finding a way to enact legislation that implements 
those portions of S. 1300 that have environmental consequences. In the interim, the 
members  of  the  all-cargo  air  carrier  industry  will  continue  to  explore  ways  to  im-
prove  its  environmental  performance  while  ensuring  that  it  can  continue  to  service 
its shipper clients around the world. 

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  file  these  comments.  If  the  Committee  has  any 
questions  with  respect  to  the  positions  advanced,  please  do  not  hesitate  to  contact

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF RAILROAD PASSENGERS 

Washington, DC, June 24, 2008 

Hon. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 
Chairman, 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 
Washington, DC. 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 

The  National  Association  of  Railroad  passengers  appreciates  your  providing  a 
forum  to  consider  how  the  transportation  sector  can  innovate  and  adapt  to  address 
increased  demand  in  a  manner  which  mitigates  the  negative  impacts  of  global  cli-
mate  change.  I  ask  that  this  letter  be  made  part  of  the  record  in  today’s  hearing. 
Based  on  2005  data  reported  last  year  by  the  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory, 
Amtrak  energy  consumption  per  passenger-mile  was  17  percent  lower  than  by  air-
lines  and  21  percent  lower  than  by  automobiles.  However,  these  numbers  may  un-
derstate the rail advantage because: 

1. Amtrak ridership has increased since 2005 while its energy consumption has 
been reduced. 
2. While airlines and auto owners are constantly investing in newer, more fuel- 
efficient units, Amtrak’s youngest locomotives are 7 years old; the main fleet of 
road  diesels  was  acquired  between  1996  and  2001.  The  well-known  Acela  train 

8 The  Association  does  not  specifically  endorse  such  a  system  of  FAA  funding  but  feels  that 
it  should  be  explored  as  a  potential  compromise  as  the  reauthorization  debate  moves  forward. 
No final position on this type of funding can be taken until more details are developed. 

9 Department of Transportation Inspector General Report CR–2008–028, ‘‘Use of the National 

Airspace System’’, March 3, 2008. 

10 The  Report  goes  on  to  conclude  that  fuel  consumption  is  not  a  perfect  measure  of  system 
use, but it clearly indicates that such a measure is clearly better than the existing system. De-
partment of Transportation Inspector General Report CR–2008–028, p. 3.

sets, due to safety-related design changes, will remain over-powered until addi-
tional passenger cars can be added. 
3.  Oak  Ridge  numbers  do  not  reflect  the  added  environmental  damage  that  re-
sults  from  high-altitude  emissions;  there  apparently  is  not  yet  scholarly  agree-
ment on how to quantify this added impact. 
4. Externalities: 

(a) The ability of trains to stimulate pedestrian- and transit-friendly devel-
opment in town centers such as at Washington Union Station and in many 
other Amtrak-served communities of all sizes. 
(b) Good intermodal connections among trains and other forms of transpor-
tation  make  public  transportation  more  attractive  by  more  closely  emu-
lating  the  auto’s  flexibility.  Of  particular  note  this  summer  is  the  planned 
August  opening  of  the  St.  Louis  Gateway  Station  which  will  give  St.  Louis 
Amtrak  and  Greyhound  passengers  their  first  attractive,  visible  terminal, 
and  connection  to  local  buses  and  the  highly  successful  light  rail  line  (that 
serves both the airport and Illinois suburbs). 

Amtrak  is  now  in  its  sixth  year  of  increasing  ridership,  one  of  many  indications 
that  Americans  remain  way  ahead  of  policymakers  in  willingness  to  embrace  en-
ergy-efficient travel. President Bush and many other leaders tend to focus on ‘‘tech-
nology’’  as  the  solution  to  our  climate  change  and  energy  problems  but  to  overlook 
the fact that the most feasible ‘‘technology’’ we have at our disposal is adequate de-
velopment  of  train  service,  which  our  Association  has  been  promoting  since  our 
founding in 1967. 

As  Americans  across  the  Nation  struggle  with  record  fuel  prices  and  rapidly  con-
gesting  roadways,  the  choice  to  ride  trains,  to  some  extent,  has  become  a  forced 
one—at least where seats are still available for sale. Amtrak’s nationwide ridership 
jumped 11 percent in the last 7 months—clear evidence that Americans are turning 
to  intercity  passenger  trains  in  reaction  to  skyrocketing  gas  prices  and  turmoil  in 
the airline industry. 

Now, the Nation needs to address the consequences of funding priorities that con-
tinue to neglect rail-transport—relative both to rail-development needs, and to Fed-
eral  spending  on  other  modes  of  transport.  When  people  read  reports  of  your  good 
work  on  S.  294  and  the  House’s  recent  passage  of  H.R.  6003,  they  are  tempted  to 
think that spending priorities have changed and ‘‘real’’ passenger train development 
is  just  around  the  corner.  Last  week’s  action  on  Fiscal  2009  funding  by  the  House 
appropriations  subcommittee  brought  us  back  to  reality.  Tough  budget  limits  and 
heavy demands by other programs limited the increase in passenger train spending 
to $144 million—enough to cover the back pay recommended by Presidential Emer-
gency  Board  242  and  increase  the  tiny  U.S.  DOT  fund  for  matching  state  invest-
ments to $60 million from the current $30 million. 

Options to augment appropriated funds for passenger trains include an allocation 
of  revenues  from  any  cap  and  trade  bill  that  may  eventually  become  law,  as  well 
as tax credit and tax exempt bonds which Congress has considered as a high speed 
rail funding source. 

We,  as  a  nation,  have  too  long  been  building  cities  predicated  largely  upon  the 
assumption  that  every  citizen  has  an  auto.  Instead  of  planning  communities  which 
take  into  account  the  changes  that  come  with  economic  and  population  growth,  we 
have continually utilized instruments and methods to delay facing the consequences 
of  this  growth.  This  is  reflected  in  the  growing  cost  of  transport.  A  new  Brookings 
Institute  report  says  transportation  is  now  the  second  largest  expense  for  most 
American households—consuming on average 20 cents out of every dollar. The Sur-
face Transportation Policy Project previously documented that transport takes a big-
ger  share  of  household  income  where  public  transport  is  less  developed.  Auto-ori-
ented housing configurations, in large part, limit the short-term relief the transpor-
tation sector can provide. 

Long-term  costs  benefit  analysis  of  our  options  underscores  the  importance  of  to-
day’s  decisions  and  how  they  will  shape  the  landscape  and  potential  of  our  future 
cities  and  networks.  By  expanding  passenger  train  capacity,  we  can  quickly  allow 
more  Americans  to  use  trains  to  cut  transportation  costs,  avoid  traffic  stress  and 
air travel headaches, and minimize our oil dependence and negative impacts on cli-
mate change. Beyond that, we will lay the foundation for enabling a growing share 
of  our  population  to  enjoy  the  economic  and  quality-of-life  benefits  that  come  with 
pedestrian-friendly development.

NATIONAL BUSINESS AVIATION ASSOCIATION, INC. 

Washington, DC, June 23, 2008 

Hon. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 
Chairman, 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 
Washington, DC. 
Dear Chairman Inouye: 

As the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation considers cli-
mate  change  issues,  I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  reaffirm  general  avia-
tion’s  commitment  to  reducing  aircraft  emissions  and  protecting  our  environment. 
On behalf of our 8,000 members across the country, National Business Aviation As-
sociation  (NBAA)  acknowledges  that  when  it  comes  to  general  aviation  operations, 
environmental  stewardship  is  an  imperative.  We  continually  work  to  develop  rea-
sonable  and  balanced  policies  that  support  the  industry’s  twin  objectives  of  pro-
moting mobility while minimizing its environmental footprint. 

Although the industry represents a tiny fraction of transportation emissions, gen-
eral  aviation  has  long  led  the  way  in  promoting  advances  aimed  at  minimizing  its 
environmental footprint. For example, 20 years ago, the industry developed winglets 
for  general  aviation  aircraft,  which  optimize  aircraft  performance  and  flight  range, 
and contribute to a more efficient fuel burn, thereby reducing emissions. This equip-
ment is now in place on a large number of general aviation aircraft. 

The  industry  continues  to  reduce  engine  emissions  through  new  technologies, 
which  means  that  today’s  aircraft  engines  are  cleaner,  quieter,  and  more  fuel-effi-
cient  than  ever.  In  fact,  general  aviation  turbine  engines  today  are  an  average  of 
30 percent more fuel efficient than those certified in 1976—and 50 percent more fuel 
efficient than those introduced in the 1960s. 

Operational  improvements  supported  by  general  aviation  have  also  resulted  in 
system  efficiencies  that  help  the  environment  Over  3  years  ago,  NBAA  members 
began  equipping  aircraft—at  their  own  cost—with  cockpit  technology  allowing  for 
Reduced  Vertical  Separation  Minimums,  or  RVSM,  which  effectively  doubled  the 
system’s airspace capacity. 

General  aviation  was  also  at  the  forefront  of  the  development  of  automatic  de-
pendent  surveillance-broadcast  (ADS–B),  the  cornerstone  for  aviation  system  mod-
ernization and capacity expansion, because it allows for optimal efficiencies in rout-
ing, approaches and other uses of the aviation system. 

In  addition,  NBAA  members  supported  the  development  of  precision  approach 
procedures, which likewise produce efficiencies by enabling operators to custom-tai-
lor flight paths, minimizing fuel burn and noise, while preserving operational safety. 
Going forward, NBAA will continue to look for ways to further reduce our environ-

mental footprint. 

We also believe that an effective way to reduce emissions is to continue the work 
already done to implement a more efficient Next Generation, or ‘‘NextGen’’ aviation 
system  based  on  satellite  technology.  The  Government  Accountability  Office  has 
cited  FAA  data  showing  that  ‘‘the  full  implementation  of  NextGen  could  reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft by up to 12 percent by 2025.’’ 

NBAA commends the Commerce Committee for its work to modernize our system 
and  expedite  the  transition  to  NextGen.  We  support  the  recent  Senate  agreement 
on FAA funding and look forward to working with the Committee to complete work 
on  FAA  reauthorization  and  aviation  system  modernization  this  year,  so  that  the 
potential for significantly reducing aircraft emissions can be fully realized. 

Thank you for your consideration of our comments. Please do not hesitate to con-

tact me if you have any questions or would like additional information. 

Regards,

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

HON. JOHN PORCARI 

105 

Question  1.  What  do  you  believe  is  the  appropriate  role  for  state  transportation 

decisionmakers and planners in combating climate change? 

Answer.  The  next  authorization  of  the  highway/transit  program  provides  an  op-
portunity  to  begin  incorporating  climate  change  considerations  into  Federal  trans-
portation  policy.  The  challenge  in  this  authorization  will  be  to  institute  effective 
policies  for  reducing  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  and  adapting  to  the  impacts 
of  climate  change,  while  minimizing  Federal  regulatory  burdens  and  ensuring  that 
the transportation system continues to deliver a high level of accessibility and safety 
for passengers and freight traffic. 

There  are  many  ways  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  from  the  transportation  sector. 
Some solutions, including development of cleaner vehicle propulsion technology and 
fuels  and  improving  fuel  economy  will  largely  be  in  the  hands  of  manufacturers. 
GHG  emissions  can  also  be  lowered  by  reducing  transportation  demand,  including 
that in vehicle miles traveled (VMT); improving system operations and driver behav-
ior;  and  providing  modal  alternatives.  State  transportation  decisionmakers  and 
planners  may  opt  to  pursue  these  options,  but  may  be  limited  in  part  by  funding 
and authority for implementing these various strategies. 

Major manufacturers are already working on the development of much more fuel- 
efficient vehicles, including conventional gas/electric hybrids, plug-in hybrids, hydro-
gen fuel cell vehicles, and electric-powered vehicles. These innovations have the po-
tential  to  provide  a  giant  leap  in  energy  efficiency  and  to  reduce  GHG  emissions, 
without  sacrificing  safety  or  mobility.  These  types  of  breakthroughs  are  vital  not 
only  for  reducing  GHG  emissions  in  the  U.S.  but  also  for  reducing  GHG  emissions 
around  the  world,  including  developing  countries.  States  can  incentivize  the  adop-
tion of these new technologies in many ways, including for example through the pro-
vision  of  tax  credits  or  matching  funds,  leading-by-example  in  state  fleets,  and 
through support for pilot projects such as new fueling infrastructure. 

Beyond  technological  improvements,  effecting  a  policy  shift  toward  smart,  green 
and  sustainable  growth  requires  transportation  planners  and  land  use  planners  to 
align  interests  to  create  new  and  redeveloped  places  that  reduce  dependence  on 
driving.  Mixed-use,  interconnected  and  pedestrian-friendly  neighborhoods  providing 
access  to  homes,  jobs,  schools,  and  other  destinations  will  help  reduce  trip-induced 
emissions. 

Recent evidence shows that VMT growth trends may be tapering off: rather than 
growing  at  2  percent  or  more  annually,  VMT  has  been  increasing  at  a  modest  one- 
half  of  a  percent  since  2004.  And  as  we  have  all  witnessed,  VMT  in  recent  months 
has  declined  further  in  response  to  sharply  higher  gasoline  prices  and  economic 
forces.  The  recent  VMT  trends  suggest  that  VMT  growth  is  abating  on  its  own, 
thereby  lessening  the  need  for  Federal  VMT  reduction  mandates.  However,  as  long 
as  VMT  from  carbon-based  fuels  is  contributing  to  GHG  emissions,  we  must  link 
transportation and land use decisionmaking to reduce our dependence on oil and en-
courage the kind of land development and transportation choices that result in more 
climate-friendly, energy efficient, lower cost options for Americans. 

While better land-use planning can be an effective tool in reducing GHGs and the 
growth  in  VMT,  most  land  use  decisions  tend  to  be  under  local  government  control 
and  not  the  purview  of  the  states.  It  is  imperative  however,  that  states  not  be  left 
out of the critical pathways for decisionmaking, as regional, multi-jurisdictional and 
multi-state  issues  are  important  aspects  of  planning  effective  strategies  to  reduce 
GHGs.  Recent  focus  on  Metropolitan  Planning  Organizations  to  combat  climate 
change would be improved by consideration of the appropriate state role during the 
process  from  planning  to  implementation.  The  challenge  of  addressing  climate 
change should be done as part of the existing statewide and metropolitan transpor-
tation  planning  process.  The  planning  process  provides  the  appropriate  venue  for 
States  and  Metropolitan  Planning  Organizations  (MPOs)  to  develop  strategies  for 
reducing  GHG  emissions  from  the  transportation  system,  adapting  the  transpor-
tation system to the impacts of climate change, developing our land sustainably, and 
increasing the absorption of GHGs. And while funding is necessary for those respon-
sible  for  the  planning  stage—which  may  be  at  any  level  of  government,  and  if  at 
the  local  level,  can  be  enhanced  by  input  from  the  state—the  significant  resources 
that  are  provided  for  the  implementation  of  projects  to  combat  climate  change 
should be accorded primarily to states for prioritized investment reflecting the scope 
of needs across the state. 

GHG emissions should be addressed through a new framework that takes into ac-
count  the  global  nature  of  the  challenge.  This  framework  will  likely  require  new 
Federal  direction,  rather  than  relying  on  existing  conformity  requirements  under

the  Clean  Air  Act,  which  are  designed  for  pollutants  that  can  be  controlled  on  a 
local  and  regional  basis.  The  air  quality  benefits  of  this  process  are  difficult  to  dis-
cern,  and  compliance  with  the  transportation  conformity  requirements  has  become 
increasingly  complex  and  costly.  The  air  has  become  cleaner  in  recent  years,  but 
much  of  the  improvement  has  resulted  from  technology  and  increasingly  effective 
EPA  regulations  requiring  a  transition  to  clean  vehicle  engines  and  fuels.  Should 
a  GHG  conformity  process  be  considered,  it  is  important  that  states  play  a  signifi-
cant  role  in  the  development  of  this  strategy,  to  ensure  that  GHG  impacts  are  con-
sidered at a regional level and not at the level of individual projects. 

Question  2.  As  users  of  climate  information  and  services,  what  type  of  data  is 
most  important  to  you  and  how  do  you  think  the  Federal  Government  can  improve 
the climate information and services it provides? 

Answer. Much more data and information is needed regarding climate change ad-
aptation  and  the  potential  impacts  from  rising  temperatures  on  the  transportation 
system.  The  following  information  would  be  helpful  to  state  Departments  of  Trans-
portation: 

states to prepare for and conduct evacuations. 

• Notification of high temperature days and the likelihood of forest fires, to allow 
• Notification  of  changes  in  precipitation  patterns  and  specific  severe  weather 
events. Flooding stresses the capacity of drainage systems, disrupts traffic man-
agement, and increases highway incidents and damages pavement structure. 
• Information regarding sea level rise and impacts to coastal areas. This informa-
tion  will  allow  the  states  to  minimize  disruptions  in  connectivity  and  access  to 
the transportation network and provide reliable transportation services. 
• Information  regarding  storm  activity,  which  can  lead  to  service  disruption  and 
infrastructure damage. Advanced notification will assist the states to better pre-
pare for and conduct evacuations. 
• Information  regarding  average  temperature  increases,  which  may  require 

changes in materials, maintenance and operations. 

Additionally,  prior  to  requiring  states  to  measure  GHG  emissions,  EPA  and 
FHWA  must  work  with  the  states  and  MPOs  to  develop  functional  GHG  emissions 
models.  Models  are  necessary  to  determine  the  overall  statewide  emissions  and  the 
emissions benefits of selected emission reduction strategies. 

Much  more  data  will  be  needed  to  better  understand  and  address  transportation 
related  emissions  and  mitigation  strategies,  particularly  freight-related  GHG  emis-
sions.  Federal  funding  assistance  will  be  needed  to  test,  implement  and  evaluate  a 
variety of solutions to address climate change. 

States  are  at  various  stages  of  tackling  climate  change  and  new  data  needs  are 
emerging  daily.  States  will  need  assistance  in  identifying  effective  strategies  for 
their  particular  region  and  circumstances.  AASHTO  is  establishing  a  Climate 
Change Program that will assist in identifying additional data needs and will work 
with the Committees of jurisdiction in Congress as well as with EPA and U.S. DOT 
to tackle these important issues. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. THOMAS R. CARPER TO 

HON. JOHN PORCARI 

Question  1.  We  have  had  hearings  in  both  this  committee  and  in  Environment 
and Public Works on freight movement. And most witnesses have called for a freight 
fund  and  single  freight  policy.  This  is  because  freight  is  moved  by  multiple  modes 
of transportation on each trip—truck, train and ship. The system works better when 
we  plan  for  the  movement  of  the  cargo  as  opposed  to  the  machines  moving  them. 
It occurs to me that people are the same way. For example, I drive to the train sta-
tion,  take  the  train  to  DC  and  then  walk  to  the  office.  What  can  we  do  during  the 
transportation  reauthorization  to  shift  our  policy  toward  moving  people  and  goods 
instead of moving cars, trucks, ships, etc.? 

Answer.  AASHTO’s  authorization  recommendations  include  an  approach  to  re-
forming  the  planning  and  project  selection  process  which  addresses  precisely  this 
question.  AASHTO’s  proposal  closely  parallels  ideas  recommended  by  the  National 
Surface  Transportation  Policy  and  Revenue  Study  Commission.  We  recommend  a 
five-step  process:  First,  Refocus  highway  and  transit  programs,  for  the  most  part, 
on objectives of genuine national interest. Second, Set national goals through which 
the  objectives  can  be  achieved.  Third,  Direct  states  and  MPOs  through  their  long- 
range  plans  to  set  targets  through  which  they  will  seek  to  meet  the  national  goals. 
Fourth, Select investments which will help to achieve those targets. Fifth, Measure

107 

improvements  in  performance  which  show  the  progress  being  made  toward  achiev-
ing  those  targets  and  report  on  the  results.  It  is  during  the  project  selection  phase 
when  state  DOTs  and  MPOs  would  determine  which  projects  or  mix  of  projects 
would  best  help  meet  the  goals  and  targets  in  question.  At  that  point,  they  would 
have to get specific and determine which improvement in which mode would be the 
best solution to the problem. 

One key way to ensure effective decisionmaking and investment at the state level 
is  to  provide  sufficient  flexibility  to  states  to  shift  resources  between  programs  and 
modes. Flexibility across the programs and modes combined with performance meas-
ures  will  greatly  improve  the  mode-neutrality  of  planning  and  implementation  and 
improve the outcome of Federal investment for a better transportation system. 

Question 2. Transit agencies across the country are struggling to meet increasing 
demand  resulting  from  high  gas  prices.  At  the  same  time,  more  people  are  turning 
to  transit  as  a  clean,  affordable  way  to  travel.  In  fact,  the  typical  public  transpor-
tation  user  on  average  needs  to  buy  half  as  much  gasoline  as  a  person  without  ac-
cess to transit. Is the Federal investment in public transportation adequate to serve 
the public in an era of high gas prices? 

Answer. From our perspective in Maryland, the answer is no—Federal investment 
is  not  adequate  to  serve  our  bus  and  rail  transit  needs.  Our  local  communities  and 
large  municipalities  are  struggling  to  meet  the  needs  of  rapidly  growing  bus  de-
mands,  and  the  Federal  New  Starts  program  is  underfunded  and  ill-constructed  to 
help communities tackle other transit needs. 

AASHTO’s  transit  authorization  proposal  calls  for  progressively  increasing  fund-
ing  for  transit  over  the  six-year  authorization  period,  totaling  $93  billion  over  the 
six-year  period.  In  addition,  the  proposal  calls  for  establishing  transit-supportive 
policies  to  enable  a  doubling  of  ridership  to  more  than  20  billion  by  2030  and  50 
billion by 2050. 

In Maryland, our climate change commission report calls for doubling transit rid-
ership  by  2020  but  we  will  need  significant  support  from  the  Federal  Government 
to do this and urge Congress to consider supporting at least the level of funding pro-
posed by AASHTO. The economic downturn and higher gas prices are impacting the 
ability of many states to increase transit options. Obviously Maryland, compared to 
less-urbanized  states,  can  and  will  rely  more  heavily  on  transit  to  solve  our  trans-
portation issues, however, AASHTO’s call for increased transit investment is a clear 
sign that transit is seen as part of the solution for states across the Nation. 

Question 3. Several studies have shown that transportation plans are far more ef-
ficient and more effective at reducing greenhouse gas emissions when they are inte-
grated  with  local  land  use  and  development  plans.  What  role  should  the  Federal 
Government  play  in  helping  ensure  that  its  transportation  investments  are  paired 
with  good  local  land-use  decisions  to  ensure  that  maximum  the  taxpayers’  invest-
ment  and  to  reduce  emissions?  What  are  state  governments  doing  to  address  this? 
Answer.  The  statewide  and  metropolitan  planning  process  requires  consideration 
of  ways  to  ‘‘promote  consistency  between  transportation  improvements  and  State 
and local planned growth and economic development patterns.’’ By maintaining this 
provision, Congress should continue to encourage strong linkages between transpor-
tation and land use plans. 

States  are  increasing  their  efforts  to  link  transportation  and  land  use  planning, 
while  respecting  local  government’s  traditional  role  in  making  land  use  decisions. 
In States that are seeing increased growth, the current relationship has caused ten-
sions.  This  said,  many  local  governments  are  beginning  to  adapt  their  land  use 
plans to encourage more energy-efficient land use patterns. AASHTO’s authorization 
policies  ask  Congress  to  support  these  State  and  local  efforts  by  increasing  funding 
for  joint  initiatives  to  coordinate  transportation  and  land  use  planning,  including 
creation  of  a  new  Transportation  and  Land  Use  Program  to  replace  the  existing 
Transportation  Community  and  System  Preservation  (TSCP)  Program.  Under  this 
proposal,  the  former  TCSP  program  would  be  transformed  into  a  merit-based,  com-
petitively  awarded  discretionary  program  funded  at  $100  million  per  year,  with  in-
creased funding and emphasis on sustainability and quality of life. Funds would be 
allocated  through  a  competitive  application  process  by  USDOT  to  States,  MPOs,  or 
local governments for: 

oriented development. 

• Programs  and  projects  that  support  focused  growth,  infill  housing,  and  transit- 
• The integration of context sensitive solutions. 
• Programs  that  support  local  planning  and  policy  programs  and  local  technical 
assistance to better link transportation and land use strategies to preserve frag-
ile natural and human environments.

• Programs and projects that improve connectivity within and between modes for 
passenger  and  freight  traffic  and  use  operations  and  management  strategies  to 
improve  efficiency  of  the  transportation  system,  avoiding  the  need  for  capacity 
increases. 
• Programs  and  projects  to  ensure  efficient  access  to  jobs,  services,  and  centers 
• Transportation  programs  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  and  increase  GHG  absorp-

of trade. 

tion. 

AASHTO’s  authorization  proposals  also  call  for  Congress  to  increase  the  Federal 
share for transportation projects explicitly designed to support sustainable land use 
and  focused  growth  strategies  and  to  reduce  the  rate  of  growth  of  VMT.  Finally, 
AASHTO  is  calling  on  Congress  to  provide  funding  for  transportation  from  climate 
change legislation to help address GHG reduction. A strong state role will help im-
prove the viability of the investment decisions. 

Question 4. Right now, the Department of Transportation is divided into agencies 
responsible for a single mode of travel. Further, when I was Governor of Delaware, 
I  found  that  if  we  decided  to  build  a  road,  we  could  get  80  percent  of  the  funding 
from the Federal Government. If we chose to invest in transit, we might only receive 
50  percent.  However,  if  we  decided  the  best,  lowest  cost  investment  was  in  pas-
senger  rail,  we  got  no  Federal  funds  at  all.  How  does  this  impact  the  goal  of  inter-
modalism?  And  how  might  it  interfere  with  the  development  of  an  integrated,  effi-
cient transportation system? 

Answer. As the Secretary of a multimodal agency, I agree that the current system 
is flawed and needs to be revised. Inadequate investments have resulted in gaps in 
our transportation system, lowering transit or rail ridership, increasing aviation and 
highway  congestion,  raising  VMT  and  GHGs,  and  lowering  system  effectiveness  for 
all  users.  Investment  in  multi-modal  projects  and  intermodal  connectors  should  be 
enabled  through  changes  in  flexibility,  funding  levels,  the  provision  of  contract  au-
thority, and through a more equitable and simplified Federal approval process. 

AASHTO’s authorization policies call for the Federal share of transit projects (in-
cluding  New  Starts)  to  be  a  minimum  of  80  percent  and  for  the  establishment  of 
a  dedicated  account  for  intercity  passenger  rail  funded  at  an  80  percent  Federal 
share  for  capital  improvement  projects.  This  Federal  allocation  requirement  would 
aid in the selection of intermodal infrastructure investments and help move us clos-
er to a seamless transportation system.

Question 1. The Federal Government has ceded most of the decisionmaking about 
what  types  of  transportation  assets  are  built  and  used  by  most  Americans  to  the 
states, localities, and private sector. While this decentralized control of planning has 
certain  benefits,  it  also  presents  challenges  to  ensuring  that  nationwide  goals  are 
achieved in a uniform fashion, particularly in the face of a rapidly developing crisis 
like  climate  change.  Do  you  believe  that  we  must  reassert  a  strong  Federal  role  in 
planning  and  shaping  transportation  infrastructure  and  usage  to  ensure  that  na-
tionwide goals are achieved, such as reducing fuel consumption and emissions? 

Answer. We need to proceed carefully in addressing the challenges of greenhouse 
gas  emission  reductions  and  fuel  economy  in  the  transportation  sector  while  main-
taining  the  mobility  and  connectivity  that  is  critical  to  national  economic  growth. 
Finding  a  balance  between  these  goals,  through  fuel  economy  standards  and  in 
other  ways,  is  best  achieved  through  uniform  national  standards  rather  than  a 
patchwork of different requirements across the states. We continue to believe, how-
ever, that regional transportation investment decisions themselves are best made by 
State and local governments because they know the transportation problems in their 
areas  and  can  work  with  us  to  tailor  the  best  options  to  address  those  problems. 
Question  2.  Did  the  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration  (NHTSA) 
base  the  new  fuel  economy  standards  in  its  notice  of  proposed  rulemaking  on  the 
average fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks for model years 
2011–2015  on  the  assumption  that  gas  prices  would  be  only  $2.31  per  gallon  in 
2015?  If  so,  can  you  explain  to  the  Committee  the  foundation  of  this  extrapolation? 
What is the relationship between this number and the fuel economy standards that 
the NHTSA will ultimately issue? 

Answer.  In  its  notice  of  proposed  rulemaking,  the  agency  used  the  reference  case 
in  the  most  up-to-date  Department  of  Energy/Energy  Information  Administration’s 
(EIA)  gasoline  price  projections  then  available.  The  retail  fuel  price  forecasts  pre-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:04 Feb 13, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00112 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\78852.TXT JACKIE

109 

sented  in  EIA’s  Annual  Energy  Outlook  2008  span  the  period  from  2008  through 
2030.  Measured  in  constant  2006  dollars,  the  reference  case  forecast  of  retail  gaso-
line  prices  during  calendar  year  2015  is  $2.32  per  gallon,  $2.42  per  gallon  during 
2020,  rising  gradually  to  $2.51  by  the  year  2030  (these  values  include  Federal, 
State, and local taxes). 

Gasoline  prices,  along  with  other  economic  and  engineering  assumptions,  can  af-
fect  the  stringency  of  the  standards.  NHTSA  sought  comments  on  its  assumptions 
for gasoline prices. The comment period closed on July 1, 2008. NHTSA is currently 
evaluating  the  comments  it  received.  These  comments  will  be  considered  in  deter-
mining the final assumptions and the final standards. 

Question  3.  What  is  the  methodology  that  the  NHTSA  uses  to  classify  cross-over 
vehicles as either passenger cars or light trucks in the NHTSA’s Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking? 

Answer.  The  NPRM  followed  NHTSA’s  regulatory  definitions  for  classifying  vehi-
cles as passenger cars or light trucks. The definitions are contained in 49 CFR Part 
523. Essentially, a vehicle may be classified as a light truck for one of two reasons: 
either  because  (1)  it  has  off-  highway  capability,  or  (2)  it  has  some  functional  char-
acteristic  that  makes  them  ‘‘truck-like.’’  If  a  vehicle  does  not  meet  the  definition  of 
‘‘light truck,’’ it is classified as a passenger car. 

A  vehicle  is  off-highway  capable,  and  therefore  a  light  truck,  per  §523.5(b),  if  it 
is either 4WD or over 6,000 lbs GVWR and meets 4 out of 5 ground clearance char-
acteristics, like approach angle, departure angle, running clearance, etc. 

Alternatively,  a  vehicle  may  be  classified  as  a  light  truck  if  it  is  designed  to  per-

form at least one of the following functions, as laid out in § 523.5(a): 

• It transports more than 10 persons; 
• It provides temporary living quarters; 
• It transports property on an open bed; 
• It provides greater cargo-carrying than passenger-carrying volume; or 
• It  permits  expanded  use  of  the  automobile  for  cargo-carrying  purposes  or  other 
nonpassenger-carrying purposes by removing or stowing the back seats to create 
a flat surface. (Starting in MY 2008, vehicles may qualify as light trucks under 
this criterion if they have 3 rows that fold or stow to create a flat surface.) 

NHTSA  sought  comment  on  its  classification  system  in  the  NPRM  and  is  cur-

rently deliberating on this issue in developing the final rule.

Question  1.  There  has  been  significant  Federal  research  undertaken  on  tech-
nologies  to  reduce  the  emissions  of  trucks  that  move  freight.  Can  you  tell  me  what 
parallel efforts have been made by your agency regarding freight rail? 

Answer.  The  Federal  Railroad  Administration  and  the  rail  industry  are  pursuing 
several  research  programs  focused  on  locomotive  emissions  reduction.  For  example, 
FRA  has  provided  grants  to  Norfolk  Southern  Railroad  and  its  partners,  General 
Electric and New York Air Brake for the LEADER (Locomotive Engineer Assist/Dis-
play Event Recorder) project. The LEADER project is a tool for assisting locomotive 
engineers  to  operate  trains  more  efficiently  by  maximizing  the  use  of  braking  and 
power.  The  project  has  been  successful  in  providing  fuel  savings  (and  therefore  re-
ducing emissions) of 15 percent. 

In addition to the LEADER project, FRA has developed an in-situ emissions meas-
urement  system.  This  device  is  a  portable  emissions  measurement  system  that  will 
allow  easy  and  frequent  emissions  measurement.  Currently  it  measures  some  cri-
teria pollutants (such as NOX), but it does not measure particulate matter (PM). Fu-
ture research will focus on PM measurement. Emissions measurement at regular in-
tervals  can  promote  engine  efficiency,  thereby  reducing  NOX and  other  pollutants. 
New  research  promises  exciting  future  opportunities  in  emission  reductions.  The 
U.S.  Army  has  sponsored  a  locomotive  development  program  for  a  fuel  cell  loco-
motive, which has the potential for greatly reduced emissions. Locomotive manufac-
turers are also working to develop a road hybrid locomotive which captures the en-
ergy dissipated in dynamic braking. 

The  rail  industry  is  pursuing  a  number  of  initiatives.  One  of  the  more  successful 
areas  are  so-called  Genset  locomotives  that  use  three  smaller  (700  HP)  size  truck- 
type  diesel  engines,  which  can  be  automatically  turned  off  when  the  tractive  effort 
demand  is  less  than  the  peak  demand.  These  ‘‘switcher’’  locomotives  save  50  to  60 
percent  in  fuel  consumption,  thus  substantially  reducing  overall  emissions.  Bur-

lington  Northern  (BN)  and  Union  Pacific  (UP)  already  use  switchers  in  California 
and Texas. The Genset concept is being extended to road locomotives with four 700 
HP diesel engines for the equivalent of a 3000 HP locomotive. The industry has also 
adopted Auto Stop/Start systems (which allow locomotives to be shut down to reduce 
idling  and  the  related  emissions)  and  Auxiliary  Power  Units  (APU)  are  also  being 
used  by  the  industry  to  provide  air  and  heat  instead  of  idling  locomotives  for  these 
needs.

Question 1. The transportation sector is responsible for about 1⁄3 of our greenhouse 
gas emissions, making it among the largest emissions sources in our economy. How 
should U.S. surface transportation policy be updated to support the goals of climate 
change  legislations?  Should  the  transportation  sector  be  responsible  for  1⁄3 of  the 
emissions reductions necessary to meet targets science says is necessary? 

Answer. In 2007, the transportation sector accounted for 28 percent of total green-
house  gas  emissions  and  34  percent  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions  (2007).  The  CO2 
emissions  of  the  combined  commercial  and  residential  electric  power  sectors,  how-
ever,  accounted  for  39  percent  of  CO2 emissions,  making  electric  power  generation 
the largest source of CO2 in our economy. Greenhouse gas mitigation strategies vary 
in  their  cost-effectiveness,  and  generally  stationary  source  measures  have  been 
found to be more cost-effective than transportation mitigation strategies. 

As  we  develop  strategies  for  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  we  must  be 
mindful  of  the  indispensable  role  that  transportation  plays  in  sustaining  and  im-
proving our economy, facilitating our trade, and ensuring the Nation’s mobility and 
connectivity. Our approach for reducing emissions focuses on: improving vehicle effi-
ciency; increasing the use of alternative fuels; advancing the efficiency of the trans-
portation  system  (often  by  promoting  market-based  measures,  such  as  congestion 
pricing);  and  improving  our  understanding  of  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on 
transportation  infrastructure.  Additionally,  while  mandates  and  regulations  have 
their place, new technologies and private sector innovations should be at the center 
of  our  national  effort  to  curb  emissions.  We  must  address  climate  change  in  a  way 
that does not compromise the competitiveness of our transportation providers or the 
shippers and passengers that rely upon them. 

Question 2. Airport congestion is a major problem. We’ve seen many airlines shift 
toward  flights  consisting  of  many  short  hops  rather  than  longer  direct  flights. 
Couldn’t  much  of  this  short-hop  air  travel  be  shifted  onto  passenger  rail  if  we  put 
the  resources  into  developing  a  network  of  convenient,  high-speed  service?  Would 
that help relieve pressure on our airports? What would be the impact on greenhouse 
gas emissions? 

Answer.  As  part  of  its  environmental  review  of  proposed  airport  enhancement 
projects, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) examines whether other modes 
of  transportation  or  other  congestion  management  actions  might  be  appropriate  al-
ternatives  or  satisfy  part  of  the  demand  for  air  travel  as  part  of  environmental  re-
view  of  proposed  capacity  enhancement  projects.  Passenger  rail  travel  may  be  com-
petitive for some trips greater than 150 miles in markets with frequent rail service 
such  as  through  the  Northeast  Corridor,  or  mid-range  trips  between  250  and  500 
miles  where  connections  are  direct  and  efficient.  Travelers  consider  time,  cost,  and 
frequency of service in making choices about how they travel. In addition, the expe-
rience of the European Union, which has 1⁄3 the land area and a more highly urban-
ized  population  than  the  United  States  shows  that  passenger  rail  services  require 
enormous subsidies. 

Current  tools  for  estimating  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  different  modes  of 
transportation  are  limited,  except  for  aviation.  The  FAA  has  developed  the  System 
for Assessing Aviation’s Global Emissions (SAGE) model. SAGE is recognized as one 
of the premier models in the world for analyzing aviation greenhouse gas emissions 
and has been used by the United Nation’s International Civil Aviation Organization 
and  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change.  DOT’s  Center  for  Climate 
Change  and  Environmental  Forecasting  has  funded  some  work  on  tools  to  compare 
emissions  across  modes,  and  FAA  is  doing  extensive  research  on  identifying  emis-
sions from aviation. 

Question 3. Right now, the Department of Transportation is divided into agencies 
responsible for a single mode of travel. Further, when I was Governor of Delaware, 
I  found  that  if  we  decided  to  build  a  road,  we  could  get  80  percent  of  the  funding 
from the Federal Government. If we chose to invest in transit, we might only receive 
50  percent.  However,  if  we  decided  the  best,  lowest  cost  investment  was  in  pas-

senger  rail,  we  got  no  Federal  funds  at  all.  How  does  this  impact  the  goal  of  inter-
modalism?  And  how  might  it  interfere  with  the  development  of  an  integrated,  effi-
cient transportation system? 

Answer.  Federal  surface  transportation  programs  have  increasingly  emphasized 
flexibility  for  States  and  local  areas  to  choose  transportation  solutions  that  best 
meet  their  needs.  This  flexibility,  however,  has  been  limited  by  spreading  Federal 
transportation  funds  over  more  than  100  programs  and  the  proliferation  of  project- 
specific  Federal  earmarks.  The  Administration’s  new  plan  to  refocus,  reform  and 
renew  the  national  approach  to  highway  and  transit  systems  in  America—an-
nounced  on  July  29—would  consolidate  Federal  programs  into  a  manageable  few, 
and give grantees the authority to make worthwhile infrastructure investments, re-
gardless of whether those investments involve transit or highway projects. The pro-
posal  also  increases  the  way  communities  can  fund  projects  with  innovative  financ-
ing  mechanisms,  such  as  private  activity  bonds,  State  infrastructure  banks,  and 
Federal credit flexibility. 

Question  4.  We  have  had  hearings  in  both  this  Committee  and  in  Environment 
and Public Works on freight movement. And most witnesses have called for a freight 
fund  and  single  freight  policy.  This  is  because  freight  is  moved  by  multiple  modes 
of transportation on each trip—truck, train and ship. The system works better when 
we  plan  for  the  movement  of  the  cargo  as  opposed  to  the  machines  moving  them. 
It occurs to me that people are the same way. For example, I drive to the train sta-
tion,  take  the  train  to  DC  and  then  walk  to  the  office.  What  can  we  do  during  the 
transportation  reauthorization  to  shift  our  policy  toward  moving  people  and  goods 
instead of moving cars, trucks, ships, etc.? 

Answer.  Building  intermodal  connections  that  provide  real  value  to  system  users 
should be a central national goal, but the constraints on cross-modal funding in cur-
rent  law  frustrate  that  objective.  We  address  this  problem  directly  in  our  recently 
announced reform proposal. 

For  instance,  the  proposed  metro  mobility  program  is  applicable  to  areas  with 
populations  greater  than  500,000,  areas  that  collectively  generate  42  percent  of  the 
Nation’s  annual  vehicle-miles  traveled.  This  program  enables  performance-based 
transportation funding to supplant program and modal specific funding constraints. 
Funding  is  awarded  through  a  competitive  process,  allowing  multimodal  flexibility 
in  selecting  projects  for  the  movement  of  people  and  goods.  Program  projects  must 
be Title 23 or Title 49 eligible, both of which include the flexibility to advance inter-
modal projects. 

Further, the proposed metro mobility and Federal interest highway programs tar-
get  Federal  funds  on  elements  of  the  system  that  are  in  the  national  interest.  This 
focus  of  Federal  funds  on  areas  of  national  interest  enables  State  and  local  govern-
ments to direct their own funds to projects that meet State and local mobility prior-
ities,  regardless  of  mode.  By  allowing  more  local  control  of  transportation  funding, 
decisionmakers most familiar with the movement of people and goods in a particular 
area  can  develop  intermodal  projects  that  provide  the  greatest  benefits  and  the 
greatest return on the Federal dollar. 

In regard to providing effective transportation access to America’s treasures, such 
as  our  national  parks,  forests,  and  refuges,  the  Administration  proposes  combining 
the existing Federal Lands Highway Program with Transit in the Parks and Tribal 
Transit  Programs  to  promote  integrated  transportation  solutions  where  congestion 
is becoming a problem. 

Finally  the  Department’s  reform  proposal  also  increases  flexibility  that  stake-
holders have to tap into existing financing mechanisms. Removing the national vol-
ume  cap  of  private  activity  bonds  (PABs)  would  allow  greater  private  sector,  tax- 
exempt  investment  in  highway  and  freight  transfer  facilities.  Enhanced  flexibility 
for  State  infrastructure  banks  (SIBs)  would  allow  States  to  capitalize  SIB  accounts 
to  provide  loans  or  other  forms  of  credit  to  public  and  private  entities  for  eligible 
highway, transit, and rail projects. And reform of the Transportation Infrastructure 
Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) would broaden the availability and enhance the 
attractiveness of TIFIA credit assistance, allowing flexibility to structure credit sup-
port  for  vital,  non-mode  specific  infrastructure  projects,  including  intercity  bus  and 
passenger rail. 

Question 5. Transit agencies across the country are struggling to meet increasing 
demand  resulting  from  high  gas  prices.  At  the  same  time,  more  people  are  turning 
to  transit  as  a  clean,  affordable  way  to  travel.  In  fact,  the  typical  public  transpor-
tation  user  on  average  needs  to  buy  half  as  much  gasoline  as  a  person  without  ac-
cess to transit. Is the Federal investment in public transportation adequate to serve 
the public in an era of high gas prices?

Answer.  The  Federal  investment  in  public  transportation  has  increased  signifi-
cantly over the last few years. Annual Federal funding for public transportation in-
creased  from  $7.6  billion  in  2005  to  $9.5  billion  in  2008.  The  Administration’s  FY 
2009  Budget  proposes  a  total  of  $10.14  billion  in  Federal  spending  on  public  trans-
portation,  an  increase  of  $644  million  over  2008.  This  is  a  record  level  of  funding 
and will help provide more transit service to accommodate increased demand. 

High  gas  prices  increase  both  ridership  on  public  transportation  and  the  cost  of 
operating public transportation. Due to high gas prices, public transportation rider-
ship  increased  2.4  percent  for  the  12  month  period  ending  in  May  2008,  over  the 
previous  12  month  period.  The  increase  in  ridership  has  helped  cover  the  incre-
mental costs associated with increased capacity utilization.

Question 1. The recent National Research Council report on the impacts of climate 
change  on  U.S.  transportation  recommended  that  scientists  develop  and  implement 
monitoring technologies that could provide advanced warning of pending infrastruc-
ture  failures  due  to  weather  and  climate  extremes  on  transportation  facilities.  Can 
you describe how NIST will respond to this recommendation? 

Answer.  The  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  is  directly 
addressing the recommendation of the recent National Research Council report that 
scientists  develop  and  implement  monitoring  technologies  that  could  provide  ad-
vanced  warning  of  pending  infrastructure  failures  due  to  weather  and  climate  ex-
tremes on transportation facilities. NIST is currently running a competition for pro-
posals  focused  on  developing  solutions  to  the  challenges  of  inspecting  and  moni-
toring  civil  infrastructures.  The  competition,  ‘‘Advanced  Sensing  Technologies  for 
the Infrastructure: Roads, Highways, Bridges and Water Systems’’, is aimed at ena-
bling  the  development  of  sensing  systems  for  the  effective  measurement  of  charac-
teristics  such  as  fatigue,  corrosion,  stress,  usage,  and  damage  in  these  infrastruc-
tures.  The  sensing  systems  and  measurements  will  provide  critical  information  for 
infrastructure  decision-makers  as  they  reevaluate  design  standards  in  light  of  new 
climate extremes. 

NIST also has ongoing research programs on predicting the response of structures 
simultaneously  exposed  to  multiple  climatic  hazards  (e.g.,  high  winds  and  storm 
surge), real-time infrastructural performance monitoring to provide advanced warn-
ing of pending transportation infrastructure failures due to weather and climate ex-
tremes, as well as the materials research aimed at improving the resilience and du-
rability  performance  of  infrastructural  materials.  The  President’s  2009  budget  in-
cludes  an  initiative  to  look  at  Disaster  Resilient  Structures  and  Communities.  This 
initiative  will  enable  the  development  of  a  robust  capability  to  predict  the  effects 
of  hazards  on  the  performance  of  complex  infrastructural  systems,  such  as  roads, 
highways,  and  bridges,  and  is  ideally  suited  to  address  the  types  of  infrastructure 
failures that are predicted to accompany climate change. 

Question 2. What do you see as the greatest gap or deficiency in scientific research 
and  information  that  NIST  can  address  relating  to  climate  change  and  transpor-
tation issues? 

Answer.  NIST  has  identified  as  a  gap  the  need  for  developing  sensing  systems 
and  measurements  to  provide  critical  information  for  transportation  infrastructure 
decision-makers as they reevaluate design standards in climate extremes. 

NIST  also  fulfills  the  need  to  develop  the  measurement  science  that  rigorously 
monitors  the  impacts  of  the  U.S.  transportation  infrastructure  on  climate  change. 
A few of the activities in this area that NIST is currently addressing are: 

• The  composition,  volume,  and  weight  standards  for  fuels  and  oil  to  allow  con-
fidence  in  trading  in  low  to  high  sulfur  content  fuels  in  competitive  markets. 
This  covers  everything  from  measures  and  standards  for  fossil  fuels  and 
biofuels, and from train cars of coal to gallons of gasoline at the pump. 

• Air  Quality  standards  for  sulfur  dioxide  and  nitrogen  dioxide  that  enable  auto-
motive  manufacturers  to  meet  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  stand-
ards and generally allow industry to tune and trade their emissions through the 
EPA sulfur dioxide cap and trade system. 

• Composition of refrigerants in automotive air conditioning systems to eliminate 
chlorofluorocarbons and find replacements that minimize impacts on air quality 
and ozone in the upper atmosphere.

• Production  of  roadway  materials,  and  the  composition,  strength,  and  durability 
of  road  and  bridge  materials  and  construction  techniques  to  minimize  GHG 
emissions. 

• Lightweight  metal  forming  and  composites  to  enable  manufacturers  to  have

the automotive and aerospace industry. 

• Development  of  the  measurement  science  and  standards  infrastructure  to  sup-
port  the  development  and  implementation  of  advanced  alternative  fuel  sources 
such as hydrogen or biofuels.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

THOMAS C. PETERSON 

Question  1.  In  your  opinion,  what  challenges  do  climate  scientists  face  when  at-
tempting to produce and deliver climate information and services that are useful to 
transportation planners? 

Answer.  There  are  two  main  challenges  that  we  face.  The  first  is  understanding 
the exact needs of transportation planners. This means knowing what weather and 
climate conditions impact transportation and exactly what types of information and 
data  about  these  weather  and  climate  conditions  transportation  planners  require. 
The  second  challenge  flows  directly  from  the  first,  namely,  developing  the  climate 
information at the temporal and spatial scale transportation planners need. For ex-
ample, a person planning an upgrade to a railroad track needs to know the tempera-
ture  and  precipitation  extremes  that  the  track  is  likely  to  experience  not  for  the 
track  as  a  whole  but  at  critical  locations  along  the  track  because  the  temperature 
extremes and precipitation level may affect the performance of the facility. 

Question 2. How is NOAA trying to address these challenges? 
Answer. To better understand user needs, NOAA actively engages with the trans-
portation community. For example, in 2007, NOAA hosted a specialized Data Users 
workshop  to  identify  the  requirements  of  the  energy,  insurance,  and  transportation 
sectors, with respect to data and information needs in the context of a changing cli-
mate.  Also  in  2007,  the  Office  of  the  Federal  Coordinator  for  Meteorology  convened 
the  Third  National  Surface  Transportation  Weather  Symposium.  These  meetings 
brought  weather  and  climate  information  providers  together  with  transportation 
planners to, among other things, enhance understanding of the weather and climate 
information  needed  for  transportation  decision  support.  Furthermore,  NOAA  per-
sonnel  serve  on  the  Committee  on  Climate  Change  and  U.S.  Transportation  initi-
ated by the Transportation Research Board. 

NOAA  is  working  to  expand  weather  services  to  encompass  customer-focused  cli-
mate  services  as  well  as  to  help  fulfill  NOAA’s  strategic  goal  of  supporting  the  Na-
tion’s  commerce  with  information  for  safe,  efficient  and  environmentally  sound 
transportation.  This  takes  on  many  forms.  For  example,  NOAA  has  developed  the 
Pacific Region Integrated Climatology Information Products and the Pacific Regional 
Integrated  Science  and  Assessment  (Pacific  RISA),  as  well  as  RISAs  in  other  parts 
of  the  country,  to  provide  the  climate  information  needed  in  the  Pacific  to  manage 
risks and support practical decision-making in the context of climate variability and 
change.  NOAA  is  working  with  the  Federal  Highway  Administration  to  update 
atlases  of  maximum  100-year  60-minute  precipitation  estimates  on  a  fine  enough 
scale  to  improve  design  flow  estimates  for  improved  design  of  highways..  The  chal-
lenges  of  producing  accurate  climate  model  output  at  spatial  and  temporal  scales 
fine  enough  for  transportation  planners  are  great  and  this  is  a  research  effort  cur-
rently underway at NOAA and elsewhere. While the ultimate payoff on the promise 
of this work is still unrealized, NOAA is providing up to date output of this research 
which is growing increasingly useful to decision support. NOAA is providing climate 
model  output  that  has  been  reprocessed  to  scales  that  are  fine  enough  to  provide 
the  location  specific  information  that  transportation  planners  need.  As  hurricanes 
anywhere  in  the  world  impact  shipping,  NOAA  is  leading  the  creation  of  an  Inter-
national  Best  Track  Archive  for  Climate  Stewardship  tropical  cyclone  database  so 
planners  can  see  exactly  where  hurricanes  have  been  in  the  past.  NOAA  is  pro-
viding  the  basic  weather  and  climate  data  and  information  from  the  U.S.  and 
around the world that transportation planners need to respond real time to weather 
and design transportation infrastructure to operate smoothly for climatic conditions 
anticipated over its lifetime.

Question  3.  Recently  the  U.S.  Climate  Change  Science  Program  released  its  first 
assessment  of  weather  and  climate  extremes  in  North  America.  Could  you  explain 
the  significance  of  climate  extremes,  how  such  extremes  may  change  in  the  future, 
and the expected impacts that these changes will have on transportation infrastruc-
ture and planning? 

Answer. As described in our paper on the implications of climate change on trans-
portation,1 transportation  is  sensitive  to  changes  in  extremes.  The  release  of  the 
U.S.  Climate  Change  Science  Program  (CCSP)  report  on  weather  and  climate  ex-
tremes  in  North  America 2 is  quite  relevant  to  transportation  planning.  Below  is  a 
table  combining  key  information  from  the  CCSP  report  on  extremes  and  the  Na-
tional  Research  Council  (NRC)  report  on  impacts  of  climate  change  on  U.S.  trans-
portation. 3

Key Impacts on Transportation 

Positive  impact  on  many  forms  of  transportation  by, 
for  example,  causing  less  ice  buildup  on  marine  su-
perstructure  and  easier  maintenance  of  railroad 
tracks.  However,  in  parts  of  Alaska  where  remote 
mines  depend  on  ice  roads,  warming  will  limit  the 
length  of  time  that  the  ice  roads  will  be  open.  Also, 
the thawing of permafrost caused by warming in the 
Arctic  will  result  in  subsidence  of  roads,  rail  beds, 
bridge  supports  (cave-in),  pipelines,  and  runway 
foundations. 

Increased  railroad  track  buckling  and  highway  rut-
ting,  more  difficult  outdoor  maintenance,  and  de-
creased lift-off load limits on airplanes. 

Increased  flooding  of  roadways,  increases  in  road 
wash  outs,  overloading  of  drainage  systems,  in-
creases in soil moisture to the point where they may 
affect structural integrity of roads, bridges and tun-
nels.

THOMAS C. PETERSON 

Question  1.  Over  the  past  month,  we’ve  seen  yet  another  disturbing  trend  in  the 
Arctic.  According  to  the  National  Snow  and  Ice  Data  Center,  the  average  ice  melt 
rate  this  May  was  3,000  square  miles  per  day  faster  than  last  May.  As  a  result, 
the Arctic ice is now at the low levels seen at this time last year—leading to a likely 
repeat of last year’s unprecedented ice melt.

Answer.  The  National  Snow  and  Ice  Data  Center  (NSIDC)  is  closely  monitoring 
sea ice conditions. While you are correct that melt rates were especially fast in May, 
the  rate  of  ice  loss  subsequently  slowed.  As  of  early  September  2008,  the  data  at 
NSIDC  actually  show  slightly  more  Arctic  sea  ice  than  at  the  same  time  last  sum-
mer. Data for August indicate the second lowest August sea ice extent. 

Question 1a. At what point do we stop saying that each year’s record, extreme ice- 
melt  is  a  fluke  and  conclude  that  this  is  a  new  state  of  the  Arctic  that  is  here  to 
stay? 

Answer.  With  the  current  major  loss  of  multi-year  ice  it  would  be  very  difficult 
for the sea ice to return to conditions of the 1980s.6 Sea ice is retreating faster than 
anticipated  by  the  models  run  for  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change 
Fourth Assessment Report.7 Contributions to this trend include a run of warm years 
due  to  natural  variability  plus  an  anthropogenic  global  warming  signal  produced 
rapid  sea  ice  loss  involving  ice/ocean  feedbacks  (from  albedo  change)  leading  to  a 
new  state  for  Arctic  sea  ice.  Models  predicted  summer  sea  ice  loss  after  2050,  but 
because  of  the  combination  of  these  three  factors,  the  Arctic  appears  now  to  be  on 
a  fast  track  for  summer  sea  ice  loss  over  the  next  decades.  According  to  scientists 
at  the  NSIDC,  the  summer  Arctic  Ocean  might  be  ice-free  as  early  as  the  year 
2030.8 An ice-free ocean in summer would be a new state of the Arctic. Due to nat-
ural  variations  in  weather  patterns,  the  transition  to  this  new  state  will  not  be  a 
smooth process, but will instead be manifested as a jagged series of ups and downs 
in ice extent from year to year. 

Question  1b.  Has  the  decrease  in  ice  thickness  affected  the  melting  of  sea  ice  in 

the Arctic? 

Answer.  The  decrease  in  ice  thickness  has  impacted  the  melting  of  Arctic  sea  ice 
as  the  extent  of  ice  at  the  end  of  summer  depends  strongly  on  how  thick  the  ice 
was  the  previous  spring,  at  the  start  of  the  melt  season.  The  thinner  the  ice  in 
spring, the more easily it is melted out in summer. Thin ice is also more vulnerable 
to  mechanical  breakup  by  storms.  As  the  ice  breaks  up  it  becomes  easier  for  the 
individual chunks (termed floes) to melt. The sea ice cover has thinned substantially 
over  the  past  few  decades,  and  this  has  contributed  to  record  low  September  ice 
extents that have been observed in recent years, such as in 2007. 

Question 1c. Can we expect for ice thickness to continue to decline? 
Answer.  We  expect  ice  thickness  to  continue  to  decline.  Already  more  than  half 
of  the  older,  thicker  sea  ice  in  the  central  Arctic  Ocean  has  been  lost.  This  is  part 
of a feedback cycle. Thinner ice in spring means more open water through summer. 
Dark open water areas absorb more of the sun’s energy than the brighter ice cover. 
This helps to melt more ice, meaning even more open water. More heat in the ocean 
also results in slower ice growth in autumn, so that the ice the next spring is even 
thinner than before. 

Question 1d. A scientist at the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center has pro-
jected that without ‘‘an exceptional sequence of cold winters and cold summers’’ his-
toric  levels  Arctic  sea  ice  will  not  rebuild.  What  is  the  likelihood  of  several  unusu-
ally cold winters and summers occurring given current climate projections? 

Answer. The Arctic region always has, and always will, be home to strong natural 
climate variability. Model results out of the University of Washington 9 suggest that 
it  could  take  six  cold  years  to  rebuild  the  thicker  sea  ice.  The  likelihood  of  six  cold 
years  in  a  row  is  small.  A  series  of  cold  winters  and  summers  is  certainly  possible, 
and the sea ice might recover somewhat in response. However, such recovery would 
only be temporary, and is expected to become less and less likely as the years pass. 
Question  2.  Our  Nation  has  billions  of  dollars  invested  in  transportation  infra-
structure  for  the  movement  of  goods  and  services—infrastructure  that  will  be  im-
pacted  if  transport  patterns  radically  shift  due  to  a  warming,  ice-free  Arctic  that 
opens new shipping routes. When will our ports, rail lines and other transportation

infrastructure  start  to  see  the  impact  of  such  changing  marine  transport  routes? 
Will  it  be  sudden  and  disruptive,  or  a  gradual  change  that  our  economy  can  slowly 
adapt to? 

Answer.  At  this  point,  it  is  difficult  to  ascertain  when  we  can  reasonably  expect 
Arctic shipping to begin, because significant uncertainty exists about further sea ice 
melting,  technology,  infrastructure  construction,  and  international  treaties.  Large 
scale  shipping  across  a  relatively  ice  free  summer  Arctic  is  unlikely  to  happen  in 
the  near  future.  Nevertheless,  the  U.S.  and  other  Arctic  nations  are  closely  exam-
ining potential shipping routes in the Arctic Ocean. The effect of shipping on Arctic 
sea  ice,  and  the  reformation  of  sea  ice  each  year,  should  be  considered  before  such 
shipping begins. 

Further,  the  loss  of  Arctic  sea  ice  is  likely  to  coincide  with  other  climate  change 
impacts  to  transportation  infrastructure  elsewhere,  such  as  compromised  rail  track 
due  to  extreme  heat,  storm  surges  and  changes  in  water  levels  at  ports,  and  ex-
treme weather events, which will impact roads and bridges for trucks. A comprehen-
sive  response  to  climate  change  is  necessary.  Any  change  in  international  shipping 
routes  can  be  expected  to  result  in  gradual  change  in  freight  movements  as  the 
transportation sector considers new infrastructure to take advantage of Arctic ship-
ping and begins shifting freight movement patterns. 

On  June  5,  2008,  the  Maritime  Administration  hosted  an  Arctic  Transportation 
conference.  The  conference  brought  together  industry,  governmental  and  inter-
national  transportation  officials  to  focus  on  the  careful  and  principled  development 
of  the  immense  Arctic  Region  as  an  emerging  and  valuable  alternative  ocean  high-
way  that  will  provide  shorter  travel  distances  for  much  of  the  world’s  international 
commerce  and  help  relieve  existing  vessel  congestion  at  the  two  major  inter-ocean 
canals.  Conference  members  also  discussed  infrastructure  impacts  of  transport  of 
freight that may result from shifting ice conditions in the Arctic region. Conference 
members  also  considered  port  infrastructure  policies  and  development  that  will  be 
necessary for safe and environmentally sound transportation of freight in the Arctic 
region. The Maritime Administration is following up to ensure that potential Arctic 
transportation  programs  are  established  and  has  created  a  Marine  Excellence 
Transportation Center for Arctic transportation policies. 

Question  3.  Given  that  it  can  take  10  years  to  build  a  polar  icebreaker,  when 
should  the  U.S.  Government  make  the  policy  commitment  to  acquiring  new  ice-
breakers for the Coast Guard? 

Answer. The Administration is currently conducting a policy review and an anal-
ysis  of  mission  and  infrastructure  requirements  in  the  Arctic,  so  it  is  premature  to 
speculate on whether or when such a commitment could be made. 

Question  3a.  The  Senate  Coast  Guard  authorization  bill  currently  contains  lan-
guage  providing  for  the  construction  of  new  polar  icebreakers  and  the  maintenance 
of  the  current  fleet.  Some  members  of  the  U.S.  Senate,  though,  are  trying  to  strip 
that language out of the bill. What would be the implications if our government fails 
to recapitalize the Coast Guard’s fleet of polar icebreakers? 

Answer.  POLAR  STAR  was  commissioned  in  1976  with  a  designed  service  life  of 
30 years. POLAR STAR is currently ‘‘in commission, special’’ caretaker status in Se-
attle, WA with a support crew of 34. POLAR STAR is not operational. The medium- 
class  HEALY,  a  very  capable  science  platform,  was  commissioned  in  1999  with  a 
30  year  designed  service  life,  and  will  be  operational  for  at  least  another  two  dec-
ades.  Under  current  asset  use  assumptions,  a  major  overhaul  to  reactivate  and  ex-
tend the service life of POLAR STAR or to further extend POLAR SEA’s service life 
would  be  needed  to  extend  the  Coast  Guard’s  heavy  icebreaking  capability  past 
2014. If the Coast Guard no longer has heavy icebreaking capability, the U.S. could 
look  to  assets  not  owned  by  the  U.S.  Government  to  meet  any  heavy  icebreaking 
requirements. 

Question 3b. What do you believe this would do to U.S. capabilities in the Arctic? 

Should the government consider this a national security issue? 

Answer.  Loss  of  U.S.  heavy  icebreaking  capacity  may  impact  the  government’s 
ability to access and exert jurisdiction over some waters in the ice-covered high-lati-
tude  Arctic.  This  could  limit  our  ability  to  establish  maritime  domain  awareness, 
assert  sovereignty  over  our  waters  and  Exclusive  Economic  Zone,  and  preserve  our 
right to transit international straits. The Administration is currently conducting an 
Arctic policy process that should address national and homeland security issues. 

Question  3c.  How  would  this  impact  our  Nation’s  research  and  monitoring  capa-

bilities in the Arctic? 

Answer.  Without  heavy  icebreaking  capabilities,  research  and  monitoring  in  the 
high  Arctic  would  be  limited  to  the  Arctic  summer.  Due  to  its  robust  science  capa-
bility,  the  medium-class  icebreaker  HEALY  is  the  predominate  icebreaker  used  for

research support in the Arctic, including the mapping of the outer-continental shelf, 
so  there  should  be  minimal  impact  on  the  current  research  program.  The  HEALY 
would not be able to support all of the current research programs if the non-science 
or  non-Arctic  missions  traditionally  performed  by  the  heavy  icebreakers  POLAR 
SEA and POLAR STAR were transferred to the HEALY. U.S. research in the Arctic 
is  frequently  conducted  on-board  icebreakers  operated  by  other  countries,  notably 
Canada, Sweden, and Russia. We will continue to work with our international part-
ners  and  would  need  to  collaborate  more  closely  with  these  partners  and  look  at 
heavy  icebreaking  vessels  not  owned  by  the  U.S.  Government  to  continue  the  re-
search and monitoring capabilities where there are heavy icebreaking requirements.

leadership  role  for  the  Federal  Government  in  four  of  the  recommendations  I  dis-
cussed  in  my  testimony:  Recommendation  #4:  improving  communications  among 
transportation  professionals,  climate  scientists,  and  other  related  disciplines,  Rec-
ommendation  #8:  reevaluating  and  developing  appropriate  new  design  standards  to 
accommodate  climate  change,  Recommendation  #11:  new  transportation  planning 
regulations  requiring  inclusion  of  climate  change  in  transportation  and  land  use 
plans,  and  Recommendation  #12:  reevaluating  the  National  Flood  Insurance  Pro-
gram  and  Flood  Insurance  Rate  Maps.  (See  response  to  question  #2  for  more  spe-
cifics.)  The  Federal  Government  is  also  mentioned  as  a  partner  in  research  to  de-
velop more transportation-relevant decision support tools (Recommendation #5) and 
to develop and implement sensors and other ‘‘smart’’ technologies for long-term mon-
itoring  of  climate  change  effects  on  transportation  infrastructure  (Recommendation 
#7). 

No  recommendations  were  targeted  solely  for  state  action.  Nevertheless,  state 
agencies  are  mentioned  as  important  partners  in  several  recommendations:  Rec-
ommendation #1: inventorying critical infrastructure facilities (along with local gov-
ernments and private infrastructure owners), Recommendation #2: incorporating cli-
mate  change  into  investment  decisions  (along  with  local  governments  and  private 
infrastructure  owners),  Recommendation  #3:  adopting  strategic,  risk-based  ap-
proaches  to  decisionmaking  (all  levels  of  government),  Recommendation  #5:  devel-
oping decision-support tools (along with Federal research agencies and universities), 
Recommendation  #9:  rebuilding  or  constructing  new  infrastructure  to  higher  stand-
ards in vulnerable regions (along with Federal funding agencies), and Recommenda-
tion #13: providing incentives for regional and multi-state structures to address the 
regional effects of climate change (along with the Federal Government). 

Please note that the recommendations referred to in response to this question and 
subsequent ones are keyed to my oral testimony. The numbers will sometimes differ 
from those contained in the Committee report (Special Report 290: Potential Impacts 
of  Climate  Change  on  U.S.  Transportation,  TRB,  2008)  because  the  report  rec-
ommendations  were  combined  or  otherwise  reorganized  in  the  testimony  in  the  in-
terest of brevity. 

Question 2. How would you suggest Congress or the Federal Government proceed 
to implement the National Research Council’s recommendations you outline in your 
testimony? 

Answer. The next steps for Congress and Federal agencies to implement the first 
four  recommendations  best  suited  for  Federal  action  listed  in  the  response  to  ques-
tion #1 are detailed here: 

a. Recommendation #4: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 
the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  (US  DOT),  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey, 
and  other  relevant  agencies  should  work  together  to  institute  a  process  for  im-
proved  communication  among  transportation  professionals,  climate  scientists, 
and  those  in  other  relevant  scientific  disciplines,  and  establish  a  clearinghouse 
for transportation-relevant climate change information. 
b. Recommendation #8: U.S. DOT should take a leadership role along with pro-
fessional  organizations  in  the  forefront  of  civil  engineering  practice  across  all 
modes  to  initiate  immediately  a  federally  funded,  multiagency  research  pro-
gram,  focused  on  reevaluation  of  existing  design  standards  and  development  of 
new  standards  as  progress  is  made  in  understanding  future  climate  conditions

and  the  options  available  for  addressing  them.  A  research  plan  and  cost  pro-
posal  should  be  developed  for  submission  to  Congress  for  authorization  and 
funding. In addition, it was recommended that U.S. DOT take the lead in devel-
oping  an  interagency  working  group  focused  on  adaptation.  (In  the  interest  of 
time, this recommendation was not included in the oral testimony.) 
c.  Recommendation  #11:  Congress  in  reauthorizing  current  surface  transpor-
tation legislation should modify Federal planning regulations to require that cli-
mate  change  be  included  as  a  factor  in  the  development  of  public-sector,  long- 
range transportation plans; eliminate any perception that such plans be limited 
to  20  to  30  years;  and  require  collaboration  in  plan  development  with  agencies 
responsible  for  land  use,  environmental  protection,  and  natural  resource  man-
agement to foster more integrated transportation-land use decisionmaking. 
d.  Recommendation  #12:  The  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency,  which 
acts  as  the  insurer  of  last  resort  for  homeowners  in  designated  flood  hazard 
areas,  should  reevaluate  the  risk  reduction  effectiveness  of  the  National  Flood 
Insurance  Program  in  view  of  projected  increases  in  intense  precipitation  and 
storm  activity  from  climate  change.  At  a  minimum,  updating  flood  insurance 
rate  maps  to  account  for  sea  level  rise  and  incorporate  land  subsidence  should 
be a priority in coastal areas. 

Question  3.  Does  the  Federal  Government  have  the  organizational  infrastructure 
in  place  to  be  responsive  to  those  recommendations?  If  so,  can  you  please  identify 
that organization or office? 

Answer.  I  believe  the  organizational  infrastructure  is  in  place  to  start  the  imple-
mentation process. The study committee tried to be as specific as it could regarding 
which  level  of  government  and  which  Federal  agencies  should  carry  out  the  rec-
ommendations.  Each  recommendation  identifies  the  organizational  element  the 
Committee  believes  is  best  suited  to  lead  in  implementing  the  recommendation; 
these are indicated in my response to question 2. 

Question 4. In your opinion, what would be an appropriate timeline to implement 

the recommendations? 

Answer.  Implementation  of  the  recommendations  can  begin  almost  immediately, 
without awaiting Federal action. For example, state and local governments and pri-
vate  owners  of  infrastructure  can  begin  to  inventory  critical  infrastructure  (Rec-
ommendation  #1)  and  incorporate  climate  change  into  investment  decisions  (Rec-
ommendation  #2).  Recommendations  that  build  on  existing  experience  can  also  be 
implemented rapidly. Two examples include making transportation an integral part 
of local emergency response plans, building on experience of locations where evacu-
ation  planning  and  emergency  response  are  already  part  of  transportation  oper-
ations (Recommendation #6) and developing a mechanism for sharing best practices 
regarding  responses  to  climate  changes,  building  on  existing  technology  transfer 
mechanisms  (Recommendation  #10).  Other  recommendations,  however,  will  involve 
a  long-term  effort  [e.g.,  reevaluating  design  standards  (Recommendation  #8),  estab-
lishing  better  communications  among  transportation  professionals,  climate  sci-
entists,  and  other  relevant  scientific  disciplines  and  creating  an  information  clear-
inghouse (Recommendation #4)] or require new legislation [e.g., transportation plan-
ning regulations (Recommendation #11)]. 

Question  5.  As  users  of  climate  information  and  services,  what  type  of  data  is 
most  important  to  you  and  how  do  you  think  the  Federal  Government  can  improve 
the climate information and services it provides? 

Answer.  One  of  the  first  tasks  of  transportation  professionals  is  to  identify  the 
types  of  climate  data  they  need  to  incorporate  climate  change  into  investment  and 
engineering  decisions.  For  example,  transportation  decisionmakers  need  to  know 
which  climate  changes  pose  the  greatest  risks  for  their  regions,  what  the  impacts 
are likely to be at as fine-grained geographic scales possible (e.g., extent of incursion 
from  sea  level  rise  and  storm  surge  combined  with  land  subsidence)  along  coastal 
areas, and their likely timing. Information on the changes in the magnitude and fre-
quency of extreme events is often more relevant than changes in the means and me-
dians  of  distributions  of  the  various  measures  of  climate,  such  as  temperature  and 
precipitation. Many of these data are beyond the current state of the science. Never-
theless, Recommendation #4 suggests a process for relevant Federal agencies to take 
the  lead  in  furthering  information  sharing  and  establishing  a  clearinghouse  for 
transportation-relevant climate change information as it becomes available.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. TED STEVENS TO 

DR. G. EDWARD DICKEY 

Question.  Transportation  is  the  largest  industrial  contributor  of  emissions  to  our 
atmosphere.  Our  society  cannot  function  without  transportation,  however.  How  can 
we balance the need for transportation and the need to curb emissions? 

Answer. Transportation emissions are a function of the volume of traffic (i.e., ton 
miles  or  passenger  miles)  handled  by  each  of  various  modes  of  transportation  and 
the  emissions  intensity  (e.g.,  emissions  per  ton  mile)  for  each  type  of  traffic.  An  in-
crease  in  total  transportation  activity  can  be  accompanied  by  a  decrease  in  total 
emissions  by  the  transportation  sector  by  adapting  technologies  that  reduce  emis-
sion  intensities  (e.g.,  hybrid  automobiles)  and  by  redistributing  traffic  from  a  more 
emission  intensive  mode  to  a  less  emission  intensive  mode,  e.g.,  by  shifting  com-
merce from trucks to railways or waterways. In encouraging modal shills care must 
be  taken  to  ensure  that  public  policy  does  not  result  in  perverse  outcomes  by  caus-
ing  traffic  to  shift  from  a  more  intensive  mode  to  a  less  emissions  intensive  mode 
with more circuitous routes. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

DAVID FRIEDMAN 

Question  1.  On  April  22,  2008,  the  NHTSA  released  a  notice  of  proposed  rule-
making that would increase fuel economy standards for all cars and light trucks by 
4.5  percent  per  year  between  2011  and  2015.  Mr.  Friedman,  do  you  agree  with  the 
assumptions NHTSA relied upon to calculate maximum feasible fuel economy stand-
ards? 

Answer. To put it simply, NO. 
Through the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA), Congress led the Na-
tion  forward  on  fuel  economy  for  cars  and  light  trucks  for  the  first  time  in  more 
than  three  decades.  But,  instead  of  setting  maximum  feasible  fuel  economy  stand-
ards  as  required  by  law,  NHTSA  did  the  bare  minimum  allowed  by  Congress  due 
to a variety of faulty assumptions. 

Instead  of  doing  the  bare  minimum  to  satisfy  the  law,  NHTSA  should  put  cars 
and  trucks  on  a  path  to  42  mpg  by  2020  and  at  least  50  mpg  by  2030.  This  would 
cut  global  warming  pollution  from  new  cars  and  trucks  in  half  by  2030  and  would 
save about 50 billion barrels of oil through 2050. 

A  recent  UCS  report  indicates  that  automakers  can  cost-effectively  boost  the 
fleetwide  average  fuel  economy  of  cars  and  trucks  to  42  mpg  by  2020  and  to  more 
than  50  mpg  by  2030,1 with  a  modest  25  percent  penetration  of  hybrids  by  2020.2 
Yet  the  recent  notice  of  proposed  rulemaking  just  barely  gets  cars  and  trucks  on 
the  road  to  the  35  mpg  minimum  by  2020,  and  assumes  that  hybrids  don’t  enter 
the  market  until  2014.  Yes,  despite  the  fact  that  there  are  more  than  one  million 
hybrids on the road today, in 2008, and that the Toyota Prius is the 9th best-selling 
car in America, the analysis NHTSA used assumes hybrids won’t reach the market 
until 2014. People are not sitting around waiting for a hybrid to show up on a deal-
er’s  lot  in  6  years.  They  are  on  6  month  wait  lists  to  buy  one  because  they  are  al-
ready so popular. 

There  are  a  number  of  additional  flaws  in  the  base  analysis  that  unnecessarily 
limit  the  benefits  from  the  rule  by  limiting  the  application  of  available  technology: 
• While  gasoline  prices  soared  above  $3  per  gallon  this  winter  and  have  hovered 
around $4 per gallon this summer, NHTSA relied on projections of $2.25–$2.50 
per gallon. 
• While carbon dioxide futures are currently trading at more than $40 per metric 
ton  in  Europe,  NHTSA  used  a  value  of  $7  per  ton.  NHTSA  even  considered  $0 
per ton to be in the range of possible values. In the face of numerous economic 
analyses  which  indicate  that  combating  global  warming  will  greatly  reduce  the 
cost  of  adapting  to  climate  change,  factoring  a  $0  value  into  the  rule  is  unac-
ceptable. 

• NHTSA left out the military and strategic costs of America’s oil addiction. 
• NHTSA  assumed  light  trucks  would  grow  in  market  share,  but  between  2005 
and  2008  the  market  share  of  light  trucks  sold  from  January  to  May  dropped 
from 54 percent to 48 percent.

• NHTSA  based  its  rulemaking  on  costs  and  benefits  on  the  margin  rather  than 
• For  more  details  on  these,  and  other  flaws  in  the  base  analysis,  please  see 

the total costs and benefits of improved standards. 

UCS’s formal comments on the NPRM.3 

Changes along these lines would redirect NHTSA’s rule and EIS to illustrate the 
full  potential  of  fuel  economy  standards.  NHTSA’s  own  analysis  confirms  that  sim-
ply using more realistic gas prices or switching to an analysis based on total benefits 
would  have  led  them  to  propose  a  fleetwide  average  of  at  least  35  mpg  by  2015— 
five years earlier than the required minimum.4 Given the urgency of global warming, 
and  the  fact  that  removing  CO2 early  on  is  essential  to  reducing  the  risks  of  dan-
gerous  climate  change,  NHTSA  is  significantly  underestimating  the  potential  envi-
ronmental impact of increased fuel economy simply because they are failing to exer-
cise their legal obligation to set standards at maximum feasible levels. 

Question 2. When predicting the future costs of greenhouse gas emissions, NHTSA 
cites a $7 per ton value on global warming pollution. The Europeans assign a value 
of  $40  per  ton.  Which  value  do  you  believe  best  approximates  the  costs  of  global 
warming? Why? 

Answer. Both are too low, but at least the value from Europe is a start. The value 
in  Europe  is  based  on  ‘‘avoidance  costs,’’  i.e.,  what  it  might  cost  to  avoid  the  worst 
impacts of climate change. Given that impacts like the death or displacement of tens 
of millions in India due to sea level rise, or the cost of increase air pollution in the 
U.S.  from  warmer  temperatures,  devastation  of  spring  and  summer  water  supplies 
in  places  like  California  that  rely  on  snow  melt  for  drinking  and  irrigation,  and 
many other impacts, the cost of climate change is going to be much higher than the 
cost  of  avoiding  the  worst  impacts.  Research,  such  as  the  Stern  report,  indicates 
that costs of ignoring climate change may be as high as 5 percent of GDP while the 
cost of avoiding climate change may only be 1 percent of GDP. 

Further,  Europe’s  current  targets  are  not  strong  enough  to  avoid  the  worst  im-
pacts of climate change. Our world needs to dramatically cut global warming pollu-
tion if we are to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. For the U.S., that means 
cutting  global  warming  pollution  by  80  percent  by  2050,  plus  significant  progress 
along the way. 

Question  3.  As  users  of  climate  information  and  services,  what  type  of  data  is 
most  important  to  you  and  how  do  you  think  the  Federal  Government  can  improve 
the climate information and services it provides? 

Answer.  The  list  of  important  data  is  both  too  long  and  beyond  my  expertise  to 

comprehensively discuss here. 

When  it  comes  to  improving  climate  information  and  services,  first  and  foremost, 
the  Federal  Government  needs  to  provide  adequate  funding  to  NASA,  NOAA,  EPA 
and the other important agencies that are part of the front line in developing infor-
mation  on  the  science,  impacts,  and  solutions  to  climate  change.  Climate  change 
represents  the  single  biggest  environmental  security  threat  facing  the  Nation  and 
the world and these agencies should be funded at a level that recognizes this. 

Further,  the  scientists  and  others  working  at  government  agencies  should  never 
be allowed to be muzzled and in fact, should be given clear protections in law when 
they  speak  out  either  about  the  importance  of  the  problem  or  about  the  abuse  of 
science within their agencies. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

DAVID FRIEDMAN 

Question. There have been several tax incentives targeted toward alternative fuel 
vehicles,  including  hydrogen  fuel  cells,  mainly  for  passenger  vehicles.  Do  you  see 
similar value in adapting those incentives to other modes of transportation, such as 
rail, or more specifically fuel cell yard locomotives? 

Answer.  Tax  incentives  can  be  very  useful  tools  and  should  be  put  to  work  in 
ways that provide clear benefit to the Nation in return for the taxpayer dollars that 
are provided. This means their magnitude should be directly tied to the performance 
or benefits provided. The greater the benefit, the greater the incentive. 

That  said,  there  are  clear  limits  to  what  tax  credits  can  do  and  they  should  not 
be  seen  as  substitutes  for  a  strong  cap  and  trade  system  plus  specific  standards

such  as  vehicle  greenhouse  gas  standards,  low  carbon  fuel  standards,  and  policies 
to reduce vehicle miles traveled. 

To the specific question of rail yard locomotives, while the greenhouse gas benefits 
are  not  very  significant,  there  are  substantial  local  air  quality  improvements  to  be 
made  in  urban  rail  yards,  ports,  airports,  and  other  commerce/shipping  hubs  that 
can  be  provided  through  electrification  (whether  through  batteries  or  hydrogen  fuel 
cells). 

Well  designed  tax  incentives  to  encourage  electrification  of  these  commerce/ship-
ping hubs could make sense, but the performance metrics associated with those tax 
credits should be based on both global warming pollution and public health perform-
ance. Many sensitive populations have their lives deeply impacted by these facilities 
and their needs and health should be addressed. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. THOMAS R. CARPER TO 

DAVID FRIEDMAN 

Question  1.  We  have  had  hearings  in  both  this  committee  and  in  Environment 
and Public Works on freight movement. And most witnesses have called for a freight 
fund  and  single  freight  policy.  This  is  because  freight  is  moved  by  multiple  modes 
of transportation on each trip—truck, train and ship. The system works better when 
we  plan  for  the  movement  of  the  cargo  as  opposed  to  the  machines  moving  them. 
It occurs to me that people are the same way. For example, I drive to the train sta-
tion,  take  the  train  to  DC  and  then  walk  to  the  office.  What  can  we  do  during  the 
transportation  reauthorization  to  shift  our  policy  toward  moving  people  and  goods 
instead of moving cars, trucks, ships, etc.? 

Answer. If the goal is to shift moving people and goods in ways that will address 
global warming, save money, and reduce our oil addiction a top priority in the trans-
portation  reauthorization  should  be  to  tie  Federal  funding  to  the  lifetime  global 
warming  pollution  performance  of  any  project  funded.  At  the  end  of  the  day,  the 
Federal  Government’s  strongest  transportation  infrastructure  tool  is  the  power  of 
the purse and tying that purse to performance metrics linked to global warming pol-
lution will help deliver what we need. 

Question 2. Transit agencies across the country are struggling to meet increasing 
demand  resulting  from  high  gas  prices.  At  the  same  time,  more  people  are  turning 
to  transit  as  a  clean,  affordable  way  to  travel.  In  fact,  the  typical  public  transpor-
tation  user  on  average  needs  to  buy  half  as  much  gasoline  as  a  person  without  ac-
cess to transit. Is the Federal investment in public transportation adequate to serve 
the public in an era of high gas prices? 

Answer.  No,  the  Federal  investment  in  public  transportation  needs  to  be  stepped 
up  to  help  make  the  country  more  energy  independent,  to  save  consumers  money 
and  cut  global  warming  pollution.  As  of  2001,  less  than  one-third  of  the  U.S.  popu-
lation  lived  within  about  a  block  of  a  bus  line,  while  only  about  40  percent  lived 
within  a  half  mile.5 The  situation  is  even  worse  for  rail,  where  only  about  10  per-
cent of U.S. population lived within a mile of a rail stop, while only about one quar-
ter lived within five miles.6 We need to prioritize greater access to transit for Ameri-
cans. 

The challenge, of course, in today’s economy, is where to get the money? And the 
answer is user fees for highway and other road travel. We need to transition to user 
fees tied to congestion, pollution, and other important impacts that are not currently 
included in the daily cost of driving and that are relieved by increased use of public 
transportation.  This  is  just  basic  economics,  people  should  pay  for  the  impacts  of 
their road travel and the payments should be given right back to consumers in ways 
that mitigate the problems. 

Question 3. Right now, the Department of Transportation is divided into agencies 
responsible for a single mode of travel. Further, when I was Governor of Delaware, 
I  found  that  if  we  decided  to  build  a  road,  we  could  get  80  percent  of  the  funding 
from the Federal Government. If we chose to invest in transit, we might only receive 
50  percent.  However,  if  we  decided  the  best,  lowest  cost  investment  was  in  pas-
senger  rail,  we  got  no  Federal  funds  at  all.  How  does  this  impact  the  goal  of  inter-
modalism?  And  how  might  it  interfere  with  the  development  of  an  integrated,  effi-
cient transportation system?

Answer. The same fundamental thing missing from America’s broader energy and 
climate  policy  is  also  absent  when  it  comes  to  transportation  planning—an  actual 
plan! Instead of looking at individual modes, we need to look at transportation, and 
all  energy  use,  as  a  system  and  we  need  a  comprehensive,  long-term  plan  to  move 
that  system  in  a  way  that  preserves  mobility  while  saving  money,  cutting  oil  use 
and reducing pollution. 

There  will  always  be  a  need  for  specialized  groups  within  DOT  in  order  for  the 
agency  to  operate,  but  there  needs  to  be  a  systems  group  that  helps  bring  together 
each of the pieces to see how they work as a whole. This is similar to some of what 
has happened in the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy group at DOE. EERE 
has individual projects focusing on many alternative fuels and technologies, whether 
hybrids  or  fuel  cells  or  biofuels  or  conventional  vehicles  and  fuels.  But  recently, 
after  encouragement  from  outside  studies,  they  have  created  a  whole  group  dedi-
cated to looking at all the options at once. This will allow them to compare and con-
trast the options. Their work is in its early stages and it will not give us black and 
white answers, but it helps point to the more comprehensive approach that is need-
ed. 

All  of  that  said,  if  such  a  systems  group  is  to  be  created,  DOT  will  need  more 
people and resources in areas that have gotten less emphasis, such as public transit 
and fuel economy. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. TED STEVENS TO 

DAVID FRIEDMAN 

Question.  All  modes  of  transportation  currently  rely  on  fossil  fuels  and  there  are 
no  readily  available  alternatives.  Since  demand  for  oil  is  steadily  increasing,  how 
do  we  balance  the  need  to  increase  domestic  production  of  oil  with  a  transition  to 
alternative energy without compromising our transportation needs? 

Answer. Thank you for this question. 
Honestly,  the  data  does  not  support  the  existence  of  a  conflict  between  domestic 
production of oil and alternative energy because domestic production potential is too 
small  and  too  long-term.  Current  debates  around  drilling  in  off-limits  areas  of  the 
outer  continental  shelf  highlight  the  issue.  According  to  analysis  from  the  Energy 
Information  Administration,  new  OCS  resources  will  not  deliver  in  any  significant 
amount until 2020, will have an insignificant impact on oil and gasoline prices even 
then,  and  will  deliver  only  about  0.2  million  barrels  of  oil  per  day,  or  3  billion  gal-
lons of oil per year, between 2020 and 2030.1 In comparison, EISA requires the use 
of  at  least  20  billion  gallons  of  advanced  and  cellulosic  ethanol  by  2022,  or  the 
equivalent  of  15  billion  gallons  of  oil  per  year.  The  potential  for  low-carbon  alter-
native  fuels  dwarfs  what  is  available  from  drilling  on  off-limits  areas  of  the  OCS 
and drilling. 

Even  ignoring  the  significant  delays  and  low  volume  potential  of  resources  such 
as off-limits OCS, the U.S. faces a fundamental mismatch between demand and do-
mestic  supply  of  oil.  We  simply  cannot  drill  our  way  to  improved  energy  security 
because  our  oil  resources  represent  less  than  3  percent  of  the  world’s  supply  while 
use about 25 percent of the world’s oil. 

This fundamental mismatch points to the need for climate and energy policy that 
prioritizes  reductions  in  demand  while  maintaining  mobility  and  shifts  to  alter-
natives to oil. 

We have ignored rising demand for transportation fuel over the past two decades. 
Fuel economy was stuck in neutral while driving continued to grow. These are mis-
takes we cannot afford to repeat. 

Last year’s energy bill (EISA) represented a good start by requiring the first man-
dated  increase  in  fuel  economy  standards  since  the  program  first  began.  The  Com-
merce  Committee  showed  wisdom  by  including  language  that  ensured  that  35  mpg 
by 2020 was only a minimum, but NHTSA has not followed up on that wisdom and 
is  only  just  barely  on  track  to  meet  that  minimum  despite  its  own  analysis  indi-
cating  that  existing  conventional  technology  can  bring  cars  and  trucks  to  35  mpg 
by  2015,  5  years  earlier.  Analysis  by  the  Union  of  Concerned  Scientists  indicates 
that  the  combination  of  existing  technology  and  conventional  hybrids  would  enable 
cars  and  trucks  to  go  even  farther  on  a  gallon  of  gasoline  to  42  mpg  by  2020  and 
to 55 mpg by 2030. 

Taking  this  path  toward  improved  energy  security  (42  mpg  by  2020,  55  mpg  by 
2030) would cut consumer costs at the pump by half and would reduce global warm-

ing  pollution  from  new  vehicles  by  the  same  amount.  By  2030  the  country  would 
be  saving  about  4.5  million  barrels  of  oil  per  day  compared  to  business  as  usual*2 
million  barrels  per  day  more  than  if  we  just  did  the  minimum  required  by  EISA. 
At today’s oil price of more than $120 per barrel, that represents a national savings 
of nearly $200 billion-a-year. When compared to the potential for 0.2 million barrels 
per  day  from  off-limits  OCS  and  effectively  no  consumer  savings,  it  is  clear  that 
drilling  should  not  be  a  priority,  while  efficiency  should  receive  significant  added 
policy attention. 

In  addition  to  increased  fuel  economy,  consumers  need  alternatives  to  cars  and 
trucks.  This  will  require  increased  funding  for  transit,  car-pooling,  and  telecom-
muting. In sharp contrast to some recent proposals, highway trust funds should not 
be  diverted  away  from  these  alternatives.  In  fact  these  alternatives  need  signifi-
cantly  more  funding,  which  could  be  raised  from  per-mile  fees  that  would  cover 
wear-and-tear,  the  costs  of  congestion,  and  the  environmental  and  energy  security 
costs of oil use. 

Finally, since cars and trucks will remain an important part of personal mobility, 
additional renewable energy resources must be developed. This means increased re-
liance  on  low-carbon  biofuels  made  from  waste  or  other  biomass  resources  that  do 
not put pressure on the agricultural system. In the longer run it means a transition 
to cars and trucks that rely on electricity and hydrogen instead of liquid fuels. Sig-
nificant  amounts  of  electricity  and  hydrogen  can  be  produced  from  renewable,  do-
mestic resources and will ultimately allow us to end our reliance on oil. 

Thank you. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

ED HAMBERGER 

Question 1. One method of regulating greenhouse gas emissions is a cap and trade 
system.  How  do  you  see  an  overall  cap  and  trade  system  influencing  the  transpor-
tation marketplace? 

Answer. It would depend on the scope of the cap and trade system. For example, 
a  cap  and  trade  system  that  covered  only  the  power  generation  sector  would  affect 
the mix of commodities carried by freight transporters as (1) the power sector moved 
away  from  carbon-intensive  fuels  such  as  coal;  and  (2)  the  sector  passed  the  subse-
quent  higher  costs  of  electricity  production  on  to  manufacturers,  farmers,  retailers 
and other commercial enterprises. 

A  broader,  economy-wide  cap  and  trade  system  covering  all  sectors,  including 
transportation,  would  likely  lead  to  higher  fuel  prices  and  higher  transportation 
rates.  How  these  higher  costs  would  ultimately  play  themselves  out  among  all  eco-
nomic sectors is difficult to ascertain beforehand. Depending upon the stringency of 
the  cap  and  the  costs  of  compliance,  one  potential  outcome  is  that  the  relative  fuel 
efficiency of rail over truck transport would lead to a relative shift in freight traffic 
from truck to rail. 

Question  2.  What  impact  do  you  think  such  a  cap  and  trade  system  would  have 

on overall coal loadings in the railroad industry? 

Answer.  It  would  depend  upon  the  nature  of  the  cap  and  trade  system  that  was 
enacted.  A  cap  and  trade  system  incorporating  a  ‘‘safety  valve,’’  such  as  that  found 
in  S.  1766,  would  have  a  less  significant  impact  on  coal  loadings  than  the  system 
in  S.  2191,  which  does  not  contain  a  safety  valve.  A  second  consideration  would  be 
the extent to which the emissions reduction timetable in a particular cap and trade 
system  is  in  alignment  with  the  expected  commercial  availability  of  carbon  capture 
and storage (CCS) technology. Phasing in carbon reduction limits over a time period 
sufficient to allow CCS to mature would ensure that utilities are not forced to aban-
don coal generation as an option. 

Question  3.  As  users  of  climate  information  and  services,  what  type  of  data  is 
most  important  to  you  and  how  do  you  think  the  Federal  Government  can  improve 
the climate information and services it provides? 

Answer.  The  rail  industry  depends  more  heavily  on  Federal  weather  data  than 
it  does  on  Federal  climate  data.  Weather  data  is  critical  to  day-to-day  rail  oper-
ations. Climate data is only relevant in terms of very long-term trends.

the Federal Government can or should do to promote or accelerate research and de-
velopment of new technologies? 

Answer. We regret that the House is presently considering legislation to promote 
technologies  to  increase  the  fuel  efficiency  of  medium-to-heavy  duty  commercial 
trucks—but  not  similar  legislation  to  promote  locomotive  technologies.  We  find  it 
similarly  unfortunate  that  the  Department  of  Energy  for  many  years  has  funded 
heavy-duty  truck  fuel  efficiency  research,  but  not  rail  fuel  efficiency  research.  We 
believe that public policymakers should treat both modes similarly.

ED HAMBERGER 

Question  1.  We  have  had  hearings  in  both  this  committee  and  in  Environment 
and Public Works on freight movement. And most witnesses have called for a freight 
fund  and  single  freight  policy.  This  is  because  freight  is  moved  by  multiple  modes 
of transportation on each trip—truck, train and ship. The system works better when 
we  plan  for  the  movement  of  the  cargo  as  opposed  to  the  machines  moving  them. 
It occurs to me that people are the same way. For example, I drive to the train sta-
tion, take the train to DC and then walk to the office. 

Answer.  The  industry  has  recently  adopted  a  series  of  11  principles  that  it  plans 
to use to evaluate proposals to establish a Federal freight fund. These principles are 
attached. 

Question 2. Right now, the Department of Transportation is divided into agencies 
responsible for a single mode of travel. Further, when I was Governor of Delaware, 
I  found  that  if  we  decided  to  build  a  road,  we  could  get  80  percent  of  the  funding 
from the Federal Government. If we chose to invest in transit, we might only receive 
50  percent.  However,  if  we  decided  the  best,  lowest  cost  investment  was  in  pas-
senger  rail,  we  got  no  Federal  funds  at  all.  How  does  this  impact  the  goal  of  inter-
modalism?  And  how  might  it  interfere  with  the  development  of  an  integrated,  effi-
cient transportation system? 

Answer.  Freight  railroads  are  the  backbone  of  North  America’s  freight  transpor-
tation  network,  accounting  for  more  than  40  percent  of  all  freight  transportation. 
Yet  capacity  limits  threaten  to  reduce  the  freight  rail  market  share  as  well  as  en-
cumber any expansion of passenger rail in coming decades. To address this economic 
and  environmental  challenge,  the  rail  sector  supports  enactment  of  S.  1125,  the 
‘‘Freight Rail Infrastructure Capacity Expansion Act.’’ In terms of funding from the 
Federal Government, see answer to #1 (above). 

Final AAR Principles on Federal Funding of Freight Rail 

ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN RAILROADS 

There is a growing consensus that the Nation faces transportation challenges that 
could threaten the competitiveness of U.S. producers and products and the mobility 
of our citizens. The opportunity exists for railroads to play a significantly-expanded 
role  in  addressing  growing  transportation  congestion  and  related  societal  problems 
such as pollution, safety, and energy independence. 

Railroads are private companies that invest 17 percent of their revenue on capital 
spending for plant and equipment, a figure higher than virtually any other industry 
and five times the average for all manufacturing. Despite this record level of invest-
ment,  future  expenditures  necessary  to  expand  capacity  to  fully  meet  projected  de-
mand  for  railroad  services  and  to  meet  other  national  objectives  will  be  consider-
able. 

The  rail  freight  community  is  prepared  to  contribute  private  capital  to  fund  its 
share of proposed partnerships with the public sector. Public benefits—such as con-
gestion  mitigation  and  pollution  reduction—which  can  result  from  projects  associ-
ated  with  expanded  freight  utilization—are  valid  policy  objectives  for  which  public 
funding  is  appropriate.  Public-private  partnerships  do  not  represent  a  subsidy  of 
private  beneficiaries,  since  a  rail  carrier  will  contribute  commensurate  with  any 
benefits it may realize when it chooses to participate. 

If  government  policymakers  determine  that  projects  provide  public  benefits  wor-
thy  of  support,  then  policymakers  must  be  willing  to  commit  public  funds  commen-
surate  with  that  determination,  rather  than  relying  on  freight  railroads  to  cross- 
subsidize  the  projects  to  the  detriment  of  their  own  investment  needs.  Private 
freight railroads should be expected to participate financially in individual projects, 
but only based on the direct benefits they will receive. 

It  is  essential  that  private  railroad  investment  continue  to  focus  on  network  ex-
pansion  and  renewing  and  refreshing  existing  infrastructure.  Railroads  cannot  also

support  the  public’s  participation  in  and  benefits  derived  from  infrastructure 
projects. 

Accordingly,  AAR  subscribes  to  the  following  eleven  Federal  funding  principles, 
which  fall  into  three  categories.  The  first  nine  principles  assure  that  Federal  fund-
ing  will  create  sustainable  partnerships  with  public  entities  while  maximizing  the 
public  benefits  found  in  rail  projects.  The  tenth  promotes  freight  rail  as  a  solution 
to  looming  transportation  challenges.  The  eleventh  clarifies  that  grade  separations 
do little to benefit rail capacity or rail productivity. 

1.  Federal  funding  and  policies  must  not  reduce  and  should  encourage  private 
investment in the Nation’s rail system. 
2. In all public-private partnerships, public benefits should be funded by public 
funds, and railroad benefits should be funded by railroad funds. 
3.  The  same  funding  principles  should  apply  to  projects  involving  other  modes 
of freight transportation. 
4.  If  the  Federal  Government  establishes  a  freight  fund  to  fund  public  benefits 
of  freight  rail  projects,  funding  should  not  be  extracted  from  freight  transpor-
tation providers or their customers or disadvantage the economics of rail trans-
portation.  Further,  freight  railroads  should  not  be  required  to  assess  or  collect 
any  fees.  The  rail  logistics  system  should  not  be  saddled  with  increased  costs 
to fund public benefits, either directly or through a freight fund. 
5.  Federal  fees  associated  with  a  freight  fund  should  preempt  state  and  local 
fees, unless there is mutual agreement among the parties. 
6.  Any  involvement  by  a  rail  carrier  in  public-private  projects  must  be  strictly 
voluntary. 
7.  Federal  funding  of  public  benefits  must  not  be  in  lieu  of  the  enactment  of 
Federal investment tax incentives for increased private investment. 
8.  Federal  funding  must  not  be  conditioned  upon  a  change  in  the  present  eco-
nomic regulation of the rail industry or other industry concessions. 
9. Federal funding must be executed in a manner that preserves the rail indus-
try’s current ownership rights. 
10. Federal freight investment should focus on key transportation projects with 
significant public benefits, such as eliminating rail chokepoints, improving serv-
ice  to  shippers,  facilitating  international  trade,  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions, cutting vehicle miles traveled, and improving safety. Such projects should 
be selected based upon standardized, agreed-upon methodology. 
11.  Grade  separations  must  continue  to  be  regarded  as  primarily  beneficial  to 
the highway/road user. They do little to increase freight rail capacity or improve 
rail productivity. 

Additional AAR Principles on the Reauthorization of SAFETEA–LU 

In  addition  to  its  principles  on  Federal  funding  of  freight  rail,  AAR’s  principles 

for the reauthorization of SAFETEA–LU include: 

• Support for separate funding for the Section 130 program; 
• Support for separate funding for intermodal connectors; 
• Support for funding for Operation Lifesaver; 
• Opposition (on economic grounds) to a thaw of the freeze on longer and heavier 
• Support for public private partnerships such as CREATE and the New Orleans 

trucks operating on the interstate highway system; and 

gateway project. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. TED STEVENS TO 

ED HAMBERGER 

Question.  Rail  transportation  is  the  most  efficient  in  terms  of  miles  per  gallon  of 
diesel (over 400 mpg). What can be done to get more passengers and freight on rail-
roads while keeping in mind both still require other modes of transportation? 

Answer.  Comprehensive,  reliable,  and  cost-effective  rail  service  is  critical  to  our 
nation, and that, in turn. requires having adequate rail capacity. Railroads must be 
able  to  both  maintain  their  extensive  existing  infrastructure  and  equipment  and 
build  the  substantial  new  capacity  that  will  be  needed  to  meet  much  higher  future 
freight and passenger transport demand. 

Our  privately-owned  freight  railroads  are  working  hard  every  day  to  help  make 
sure America has the rail capacity it needs. They’re re-investing record amounts in

their  systems  ($420  billion  from  1980  to  2007,  or  more  than  40  cents  out  of  every 
revenue dollar), adopting innovative new technologies and operating plans, and forg-
ing partnerships with each other, other transportation providers, and customers. 

Policymakers  can  help  ensure  that  more  freight  and  passengers  move  by  rail  by 
addressing a number of serious impediments to meeting the rail capacity challenge. 
A few of these impediments arc discussed briefly below. 
Local Opposition to Rail Projects 

Under existing law, state and local regulations (other than local health and safety 
regulations) that unreasonably interfere with rail operations are preempted by Fed-
eral  regulations.  These  Federal  regulations  protect  the  public  interest  while  recog-
nizing  that  our  railroads  form  an  integrated,  national  network  that  requires  a  uni-
form basic set of rules to operate effectively. 

Nevertheless,  rail  expansion  projects  often  face  vocal,  sophisticated  opposition  by 
members of affected local communities. In many cases, railroads thus face a classic 
‘‘not-in-my-backyard’’  problem—even  for  projects  for  which  the  benefits  to  a  locality 
or region far outweigh the drawbacks. 

In  the  face  of  local  opposition,  railroads  try  to  work  with  the  local  community  to 
find  a  mutually-satisfactory  arrangement,  and  these  efforts  are  usually  successful. 
When  agreement  is  not  reached,  however,  projects  can  face  seemingly  interminable 
delays and sharply higher costs. 

Often,  local  communities  allege  violations  of  environmental  requirements  to  chal-
lenge  a  proposed  project,  even  though  detailed  environmental  reviews,  when  re-
quired, already identify the impacts of rail projects and determine necessary mitiga-
tion  measures.  Railroads  understand  the  goals  of  environmental  laws  and  appre-
ciate  the  need  to  be  responsive  to  community  concerns,  but  community  opposition 
to  rail  operations  can  be  a  significant  obstacle  to  railroad  infrastructure  invest-
ments, even when the opposition has no legal basis. 

Policymakers  can  help  by  taking  steps  to  shorten  the  time  it  takes  for  reviews 
of  rail  expansion  projects  in  ways  that  do  not  adversely  affect  the  quality  of  those 
reviews. 
Financial Sustainability 

Because  U.S.  freight  railroads  are  overwhelmingly  privately  owned  and  must  fi-
nance the vast majority of their infrastructure spending themselves, capacity invest-
ments carry substantial financial risk. Accordingly, these projects must pass appro-
priate  internal  investment  hurdles—i.e.,  the  investments  will  be  made  only  if  they 
are  expected  to  generate  an  adequate  return.  That’s  why  policymakers  should  say 
no to the re-regulation of railroads. 

Prior  to  1980,  decades  of  government  over-regulation  had  brought  U.S.  freight 
railroads  to  their  knees.  Bankruptcies  were  common,  rates  were  rising,  safety  was 
deteriorating,  and  rail  infrastructure  and  equipment  were  in  increasingly  poor  con-
dition  because  meager  rail  profits  were  too  low  to  pay  for  needed  upkeep  and  re-
placement. Recognizing the need for change, Congress passed the Staggers Rail Act 
of 1980, which partially deregulated the rail industry. 

The  record  since  Staggers  shows  that  deregulation  works.  Since  1981,  rail  traffic 
is up 95 percent, rail productivity is up 163 percent, and average inflation-adjusted 
rail  rates  are  down  54  percent.  And  rail  safety  is  vastly  improved—the  train  acci-
dent  and  employee  injury  rates  have  plunged  since  Staggers.  Our  privately-owned, 
largely  deregulated  freight  railroads  competing  fairly  in  the  transportation  market-
place have produced the best freight rail system in the world.

127 

Despite the severe harm excessive rail regulation caused prior to Staggers and the 
enormous  benefits  that  have  accrued  since  then,  legislation  has  been  proposed— 
most recently, S. 953/H.R. 2125 (the so-called ‘‘Railroad Competition and Service Im-
provement Act of 2007’’) in the 110th Congress—that would re-regulate freight rail-
roads. 

Re-regulation  is  bad  public  policy  and  should  be  rejected.  It  would  prevent  rail-
roads  from  earning  enough  to  make  the  massive  investments  a  first-class  rail  sys-
tem requires. As the Congressional Budget Office has noted, ‘‘As demand increases, 
the railroads’ ability to generate profits from which to finance new investments will 
be  critical.  Profits  are  key  to  increasing  capacity  because  they  provide  both  the  in-
centives and the means to make new investments.’’ 

Under  re-regulation,  rail  earnings,  and  therefore  rail  spending  on  infrastructure 
and  equipment,  would  plummet;  the  industry’s  existing  physical  plant  would  dete-
riorate;  needed  new  capacity  would  not  be  added;  and  rail  service  would  become 
slower, less responsive, and less reliable. It would mean less freight moving by rail 
when we should have more. 

As the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently noted, ‘‘Without a doubt, 
rates have decreased for most shippers, and most shippers are better off in the post- 
Staggers  environment  than  they  were  previously.  This  outcome  suggests  that  wide-
spread and fundamental changes to the relationship between the railroads and their 
customers are not needed.’’ 
Public Involvement in Freight Rail Infrastructure Investment 

Rail transportation demand is projected to rise sharply in the years ahead as our 
population  and  economy  grow.  The  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  (DOT)  re-
cently  forecast,  for  example,  that  U.S.  freight  railroad  demand  will  rise  88  percent 
by 2035. 

Railroads  will  continue  to  spend  massive  amounts  of  their  own  funds  to  address 
their capacity challenges. However, they are, and will continue to be, unable to pay 
for the socially-optimal amount of rail capacity.

The magnitude of the looming freight rail capacity issue was borne out by a recent 
study  by  Cambridge  Systematics,  a  prominent  economic  and  transportation  con-
sulting  firm.  The  purpose  of  the  study,  which  focused  on  52,000  miles  of  primary 
freight rail corridors, was to estimate the cost of the expansion in rail capacity nec-
essary for America’s freight railroads to handle the 88 percent increase in rail traffic 
forecast by the DOT for 2035. 

The  study  found  that  if  rail  capacity  needs  are  not  properly  addressed,  by  2035 
some 16,000 miles of primary rail mileage—nearly one-third of the 52,000 miles cov-
ered  in  the  study—will  be  so  congested  that  a  widespread  service  breakdown  envi-
ronment  would  exist.  (Today,  less  than  1  percent  of  rail  miles  are  that  congested.) 
Because our rail system is interconnected, this outcome would mean that America’s 
entire rail system would, in effect, be disabled. 

Class  I  railroads  are  anticipated  to  be  able  to  generate  (through  earnings  growth 
from the additional traffic and productivity gains) only $96 billion of the $135 billion 
needed for new capacity identified by the Cambridge Systematics study. Addressing 
this shortfall is critical if railroads are to fulfill their potential in meeting America’s 
freight transportation challenges.

One  way  to  help  bridge  the  funding  gap  is  through  tax  incentives  for  rail  infra-
structure  investments.  S.  1125/H.R.  2116  (the  ‘‘Freight  Rail  Infrastructure  Capacity 
Expansion  Act  of  2007)  calls  for  a  25  percent  tax  credit  for  investments  in  new 
track, intermodal facilities, yards, and other freight rail infrastructure projects that 
expand rail capacity. All businesses that make capacity-enhancing rail investments, 
not just railroads, would be eligible for the credit. 

A  rail  ITC  would  addresses  the  central  challenge  of  how  to  move  more  freight 
without  causing  more  highway  gridlock  or  environmental  degradation.  For  a  rail-
road  considering  whether  to  fund  an  expansion  project,  an  ITC  would  reduce  the 
cost of the project, raising the likelihood that the project will be economically viable. 
It would help worthwhile projects get built sooner, but would not be enough to cause 
economically-unjustified projects to go forward. 

An  ITC  would  also  stimulate  the  economy.  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  data 
indicate  that  every  dollar  of  freight  rail  infrastructure  investment  that  would  be 
stimulated  by  a  rail  infrastructure  ITC  would  generate  more  than  three  dollars  in 
total  economic  output.  Each  $1  billion  of  new  rail  investment  induced  by  the  ITC 
would  create  an  estimated  20,000  jobs  nationwide.  The  benefits  to  our  economy 
would be broad and long lasting. 

Policymakers  should  also  support  a  short  line  tax  credit.  Since  1980,  more  than 
380 new short lines have been created, preserving thousands of miles of track (much 
of  it  in  rural  areas)  that  may  otherwise  have  been  abandoned.  In  2004,  Congress 
enacted  a  50  percent  tax  credit  (‘‘Section  45G’’)  for  investments  in  short  line  track 
rehabilitation.  The  focus  was  on  assisting  short  lines  in  handling  the  larger  and 
heavier  freight  cars  that  are  needed  to  provide  their  customers  with  the  best  pos-
sible rates and service. 

Since Section 45G was enacted, hundreds of short lines have rapidly increased the 
volume  and  rate  of  their  track  rehabilitation  and  improvement  programs.  Unfortu-
nately,  Section  45G  expired  in  2007.  Pending  legislation  in  Congress  (S.  881/H.R. 
1584, the ‘‘Short Line Railroad Investment Act of 2007’’) would extend this tax cred-
it and thus preserve the huge benefits it delivers. 

Finally, a more pronounced use of public-private partnerships would help get more 
freight  on  our  rails.  Public-private  partnerships  reflect  the  fact  that  cooperation  is 
more  likely  to  result  in  timely,  meaningful  solutions  to  transportation  problems 
than  a  go-it-alone  approach.  Without  a  partnership,  projects  that  promise  substan-
tial  public  benefits  (including  reduced  highway  gridlock  and  highway  construction 
and  maintenance  costs,  reduced  pollution  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  en-
hanced  mobility)  in  addition  to  private  benefits  are  likely  to  be  delayed  or  never 
started  at  all  because  it  would  be  too  difficult  for  either  side  to  justify  the  full  in-
vestment needed to complete them. In contrast, if a public entity shows it is willing 
to devote public dollars to a project based upon the public benefits that will accrue, 
the private entity is much more likely to provide the private dollars (commensurate 
with private gains) necessary for the project to proceed. 

Partnerships  are  not  ‘‘subsidies’’  to  railroads.  Rather,  they  acknowledge  that  pri-
vate entities should pay for private benefits and public entities should pay for public 
benefits.  In  many  cases,  these  partnerships  only  involve  the  public  contributing  a 
portion  of  the  initial  investment  required  to  make  an  expansion  project  feasible, 
with  the  railroad  responsible  for  keeping  the  infrastructure  productive  and  in  good 
repair. 
Promoting Passenger Rail 

Freight  railroads  are  successful  partners  with  passenger  railroads  all  over  the 
country.  Around  97  percent  of  the  22,000  miles  over  which  Amtrak  operates  are 
owned  by  freight  railroads,  and  hundreds  of  millions  of  commuter  trips  each  year 
occur on commuter rail systems that operate at least partially over tracks or right- 
of-way owned by freight railroads. 

The potential national benefits of a strong national passenger rail system are sig-
nificant.  The  key  question  is:  under  what  circumstances  can  freight  and  passenger 
interests advance this worthy goal?

U.S.  freight  railroads  are  moving  more  freight  than  ever  before,  and  demand  for 
freight  rail  service  is  projected  to  grow  sharply  in  the  years  ahead.  Passenger  rail 
growth  would  come  on  top  of  growth  in  freight  traffic.  That’s  why,  going  forward, 
capacity  will  likely  be  the  single  most  important  factor  determining  our  ability  to 
provide  the  high  quality  rail  service  that  will  be  essential  for  both  freight  and  pas-
sengers. 

While  recognizing  existing  Amtrak  statutory  authority  regarding  use  of  freight 
railroad- owned facilities, the AAR has developed principles which we believe should 
govern new passenger rail use of freight-owned facilities: 

• Freight railroads should not be forced to give passenger railroads access to their 

property; rather, access should be voluntarily negotiated. 

• Freight railroads should be fully compensated for the use of their assets by pas-

senger trains. 

• Freight railroads should be adequately protected from liability. 
• Freight  railroads  should  not  be  asked  to  pay  for  capacity  increases  needed  to 

accommodate passenger service. 

These  principles  are  grounded  in  the  tremendous  importance  of  freight  railroads 
to  America.  Freight  railroads  lower  shipping  costs  by  billions  of  dollars  each  year 
and  produce  an  immense  competitive  advantage  for  our  farmers,  manufacturers, 
and  miners  in  the  global  marketplace.  If  passenger  railroads  impair  freight  rail-
roads  and  force  freight  that  otherwise  would  move  by  rail  onto  the  highway,  those 
advantages  would  be  squandered.  Moreover,  highway  gridlock  would  worsen;  fuel 
consumption,  pollution,  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions  would  rise;  and  our  mobility 
would  deteriorate—outcomes  that  are  contrary  to  the  goals  of  expanding  passenger 
rail in the first place 

For these reasons, passenger rail progress must be complementary to—not in con-

flict with—freight rail development. 

That  said,  there  clearly  are  substantial  public  benefits  from  expanded  passenger 
rail.  Indeed,  as  at  cost  of  auto  and  air  travel  continue  to  increase  and  the  prospect 
of  a  carbon-constrained  future  increases,  we  have  an  opportunity—and  the  need— 
to  make  far  more  concerted  efforts  than  we  have  in  the  past  to  more  fully  capture 
the  economic,  environmental,  and  social  benefits  of  reliable,  convenient,  and  com-
prehensive passenger rail service. 

But in order to be a true transportation alternative for Americans, passenger rail, 
like freight rail, cannot be achieved on the cheap. Without significant additional in-
vestment in infrastructure and equipment, Amtrak will not be able to handle all the 
people that want to use it and we will fail to capture all of those benefits. 

We  believe  that  future  passenger  rail  initiatives,  especially  regional  or  national 
highspeed initiatives, will require separate assets dedicated to passenger operation. 
This more visionary approach would enable faster and more reliable passenger serv-
ice  and  minimize  the  substantial  operational,  engineering,  legal,  and  other  impedi-
ments  that  often  hinder  the  ability  of  freight  railroads  to  accommodate  passenger 
trains. 

This  approach  will  be  costly,  but  so  will  any  approach  to  meaningfully  enhance 
passenger rail. Freight railroads believe that the public benefits of a truly attractive 
and competitive national passenger rail capability will exceed public costs, and look

forward  to  continue  to  work  with  all  appropriate  parties  to  make  those  benefits  a 
reality. 

One  way  railroads  are  doing  this  is  by  working  closely  with  Amtrak  to  alleviate 
problems that are hindering Amtrak’s performance and reliability. Individual freight 
railroads  are  currently  working  directly  with  Amtrak  to  identify  areas  where  tar-
geted  infrastructure  improvements  that  eliminate  chokepoints  can  be  made,  and 
where dispatching and maintenance practices can be improved. Joint, cooperative ef-
forts like these are far more likely to result in meaningful improvements than a pu-
nitive approach. Imposing monetary penalties on freight railroads based on Amtrak 
on-time performance, for example, would be neither constructive nor appropriate. 
Other Transportation Modes 

Obviously, neither freight or passenger railroads operate in a vacuum. Trucks, for 
example, are and will continue to be absolutely critical to freight transportation and 
to  our  economy.  That’s  why  significant  attention  must  be  paid,  and  appropriate  re-
sources  devoted  to,  other  transportation  infrastructure.  Working  as  a  whole,  our 
various transportation networks will help ensure that freight and people can get to 
where they need and want to be efficiently and cost effectively.
