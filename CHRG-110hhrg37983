information technology in health care and the investments in technology and stand-
ards development that are needed to create a national system of secure, inter-oper-
able health care information technology. Witnesses will comment on barriers to the
implementation  of  these  systems,  with  an  emphasis  on  the  role  of  technical  stand-
ards.  They  will  also  comment  on  the  need  for  legislation  to  push  toward  the  adop-
tion of such standards. This includes a discussion of H.R. 2406.

3. Brief overview

Information technology (IT) offers enormous potential benefits to U.S. health care.
According  to  the  Institute  of  Medicine,  as  many  as  98,000  people  die  in  hospitals
each  year  from  medical  errors  such  as  incorrect  medications  and  improper  diag-
noses,  many  of  which  are  preventable.  A  study  by  the  Health  Care  Information
Management  Systems  Society  found  that  as  much  as  49  percent  of  clinical  diag-
nostic testing is performed because previous test results are unavailable when need-
ed.  Applications  of  IT  to  health  care  such  as  electronic  health  care  records  (EHRs),
computerized  ordering  of  prescriptions  and  tests,  and  updated  medical  information
for  clinical  decision  support  could  save  thousands  of  lives  and  billions  of  dollars  by
reducing medical errors and miscommunication.

The entry of IT into the health care arena has been slow and disjointed. Only 12
percent  of  practices  with  five  or  fewer  physicians,  where  most  Americans  receive
their  primary  health  care,  have  adopted  EHRs.  The  health  care  industry  spends
only  two  percent  of  revenues  on  information  technology,  much  lower  than  the  10
percent average of other information-intensive industries.

A key barrier to the adoption of a national, inter-operable health care information
technology  (HIT)  system  is  the  lack  of  robust,  widely  accepted  technical  standards.
Despite efforts at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) since 2004,
such  standards  have  yet  to  be  fully  developed  and  widely  promulgated.  Moreover,
there is also a lack of conformance testing to ensure that products and systems com-
ply with established HIT inter-operability standards. In the absence of these stand-
ards and conformance tests, health care providers are reluctant to invest in HIT sys-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:49 Feb 22, 2008 Jkt 037983 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL07\092607\37983 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

4

tems because there is no assurance that they will be able to communicate with other
systems.

The  Federal  Government’s  lead  agency  for  the  development  and  promulgation  of
technical standards, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has
been  involved  with  HIT  standards  development  work  since  2005.  Because  of  its  ex-
tensive  expertise  with  issues  of  system  inter-operability,  data  security  and  privacy,
and  consensus  standards  development,  NIST  is  well  positioned  to  make  a  larger
contribution to HIT standards development work and speed the deployment of a na-
tional secure and inter-operable HIT system.

On May 21, 2007, Chairman Bart Gordon introduced H.R. 2406, a bill to authorize
NIST to increase its efforts in support of the integration of the U.S. health care in-
formation enterprise. The bill: (1) directs NIST to establish an initiative for advanc-
ing HIT integration and allows it to assist health care representatives and organiza-
tions  and  federal  agencies  in  developing  technical  roadmaps  for  HIT  standards;  (2)
requires NIST to develop or adopt existing technology-neutral guidelines and stand-
ards  to  enable  federal  agencies  to  effectively  select  and  use  HIT  systems  that  are
secure,  inter-operable,  and  ensure  patient  privacy;  (3)  requires  the  Department  of
Commerce  to  establish  a  Senior  Interagency  Council  on  Federal  Health  Care  Infor-
mation Technology Infrastructure to coordinate the development and deployment of
federal HIT systems, the associated technology transfer, and federal work with pri-
vate HIT standards development organizations; (4) requires NIST to establish a uni-
versity  grant  program  for  multi-disciplinary  research  in  HIT-related  fields;  and  (5)
directs  the  National  High-Performance  Computing  Program  to  coordinate  federal
HIT R&D programs.

4. Issues and concerns
What  is  the  true  cost  of  insufficient  use  of  information  technology  within
the  U.S.  health  care  system?  The  burden  on  U.S.  health  care  due  to  confusion,
miscommunication,  insufficient  or  outdated  clinical  information  and  other  informa-
tion shortfalls is enormous. According to a study in the Annals of Family Medicine,
miscommunication  is  a  major  cause  of  80  percent  of  medical  errors,  including  poor
communication  between  physicians,  misinformation  in  medical  records  and  misfiled
charts. Research published in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that there are
medication  errors  in  one  in  five  doses  given  in  hospitals  and  skilled  nursing  facili-
ties, and seven percent of those errors are potentially life-threatening. A study pub-
lished  in  the  Journal  of  the  American  Medical  Association  estimates  that  only
slightly  more  than  half  of  patients  receive  the  known  ‘‘best  practice’’  treatment  for
their  illness.  Inter-operable  health  care  information  systems  could  allow  physicians
to  share  patient  medical  information  and  lab  results  between  hospitals,  labs,  and
clinics; order drug prescriptions; and alert patients of drug recalls much faster than
by  sharing  paper  records.  While  quantitative  studies  across  the  entire  health  care
sector are difficult to conduct, several health associations estimate that the potential
savings  of  greater  IT  adoption  by  the  health  care  industry  run  into  the  tens  of  bil-
lions  of  dollars.  A  study  published  in  the  journal  Health  Affairs  estimates  that  a
fully  inter-operable  national  health  care  IT  network  could  yield  $77.8  billion  per
year in savings, or five percent of annual U.S. health care spending.
What  can  the  Federal  Government  do  to  accelerate  the  pace  of  standards
development and promulgation leading to inter-operability of HIT systems?
Are  current  federal  efforts  appropriately  leveraging  all  resources  for  this
effort? In April 2004, President Bush signed an executive order establishing the po-
sition of the National Health Information Technology Coordinator (National Coordi-
nator) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The first National
Coordinator  announced  a  plan  to  achieve  health  care  IT  inter-operability  nation-
wide.  As  part  of  this  plan,  HHS  signed  a  memorandum  with  NIST,  transferring  $6
million from HHS to NIST to pay for technical work in support of HIT. NIST is the
primary  U.S.  agency  for  developing  and  promulgating  technical  standards  in  con-
junction  with  industry,  standards  development  organizations,  and  foreign  govern-
ments.  NIST’s  current  HIT  work  under  the  memorandum  with  HHS  may  not  be
fully  utilizing  NIST’s  expertise  in  technical  standards,  data  security  and  privacy,
and  electronic  commerce,  and  its  familiarity  with  systems  inter-operability  and  de-
vice communication issues.
How  can  a  national,  inter-operable  HIT  system  be  made  compatible  with
privacy and data security concerns? An essential feature of a practical HIT sys-
tem  is  that  it  protect  the  privacy  and  confidentiality  of  patients’  medical  informa-
tion. It must also have strong data security provisions, so that medical information
cannot be tampered with, altered, or destroyed by unauthorized entities. HIT stand-

ards  will  need  to  incorporate  privacy  and  security  in  the  original  standards  design
(as opposed to a later addition) in order to ensure that these features will be a cen-
tral  element  of  a  national  HIT  system.  Within  the  Federal  Government,  data  secu-
rity  standards  for  all  non-classified  IT  systems  are  set  by  NIST,  under  the  frame-
work  established  by  the  Federal  Information  Security  Management  Act  of  2002
(FISMA). In addition, NIST has been deeply involved in the development and adop-
tion  of  information-exchange  standards  in  electronic  business  and  electronic  voting
systems, which have related privacy and data-security requirements.
What can be done to improve HIT inter-operability within the Federal Gov-
ernment?  The  Federal  Government  has  not  yet  adopted  inter-operable  HIT  sys-
tems.  The  largest  federal  electronic  medical  records  systems—those  of  the  Depart-
ments  of  Defense  (DOD)  and  Veterans  Affairs  (VA),  and  the  Bureau  of  Indian  Af-
fairs  (BIA)—are  not  mutually  inter-operable  or  inter-operable  with  the  private  sec-
tor.  The  Federal  Government  should  set  the  gold  standard  on  inter-operability  of
HIT systems, particularly as the demands on military and veterans’ health care in-
frastructures  are  increasing  due  to  the  wars  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan.  Dem-
onstrating  the  efficiency  of  inter-operable  HIT  systems  in  the  federal  health  care
system could also spur private sector adoption of these systems by providing a cost-
effective model.
What research and development efforts are needed to anticipate and adapt
HIT standards for the next generation of medical technologies, human-ma-
chine  interfaces,  and  patient  needs?  With  the  current  pace  of  biomedical  re-
search  and  information  technology,  there  will  doubtless  be  new  demands  on  HIT
systems and new opportunities for IT to play an important role in health care. R&D
will be needed to enable the incorporation of new technologies such as voice or facial
recognition into HIT systems and to modify HIT systems to respond to new medical
treatments  and  procedures,  such  as  remote  surgery  and  active  implantable  medical
devices.  These  R&D  activities  will  need  to  span  many  disciplines  and  synthesize
work  in  the  medical,  biological,  engineering,  information  technology  and  computer
science fields, and others.

5. Background

Although  the  United  States  is  the  most  technologically  advanced  nation  in  the
world,  the  U.S.  health  care  system  continues  to  rely  on  pen  and  paper  for  the  bulk
of its information needs. From patient medical histories, to prescriptions, to hospital
charts,  handwritten  notations  are  the  basis  for  patient  care  information.  This  sys-
tem is costly, antiquated, and prone to dangerous or life-threatening medical errors.
More than 98,000 Americans die and more than one million patients suffer injuries
each year as a result of broken health care practices and system failures. According
to  the  National  Academies,  between  30  and  40  percent  of  health  care  costs—more
than half a trillion dollars per year—is spent on ‘‘overuse, under-use, misuse, dupli-
cation, system failures, and unnecessary repetition, poor communication, and ineffi-
ciency.’’

Information  technology  offers  enormous  potential  benefits  to  improve  the  func-
tioning  and  efficiency  of  U.S.  health  care.  A  fully  realized  national  inter-operable
health  care  IT  (HIT)  system  could  reduce  errors,  improve  communication,  help
eliminate  redundancy,  and  provide  numerous  other  benefits  that  would  protect  pa-
tients  and  save  up  to  tens  of  billions  of  dollars  per  year.  The  central  challenge  to
achieving such a system is inter-operability—the ability of data systems, medical de-
vices  and  software  from  different  vendors  based  on  a  diverse  array  of  platforms  to
share  patient  electronic  health  care  records  (EHRs),  electronic  physician  orders  for
lab  tests  and  drug  prescriptions,  electronic  referrals  to  specialists,  electronic  access
to  information  about  current  recommended  treatments  and  research  findings,  and
other information.

In February 2006, the Subcommittee on Environment, Standards and Technology
of the Committee on Science held a field hearing in Portland, Oregon, titled ‘‘Health
Care Information Technology: What Are the Opportunities For and Barriers to Inter-
operable  Health  Information  Technology  Systems?’’  Representatives  David  Wu  and
Dave  Reichert  oversaw  the  proceedings,  whose  purpose  was  to  review  the  potential
benefits of IT to both patients and the health care industry, and to determine what
actions  Federal  and  State  governments  and  the  private  sector  should  take  to  speed
the  adoption  of  inter-operable  HIT  systems.  Witnesses  stressed  the  need  for  stand-
ardization  in  the  HIT  industry,  and  encouraged  strong  investment  by  the  Federal
Government, especially NIST, in standards development and education and training
activities for health care providers.

6. Bill summary of H.R. 2406
Section 1. Findings

6

Establishes  Congressional  findings  that  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and
Technology  (NIST)  is  well  equipped  to  address  HIT  enterprise  integration  because
of  its  experience  with  electronic  commerce,  security,  and  privacy,  as  well  as  health
care business through its Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Program.
Section 2. Health Care Information Enterprise Integration Initiative

Directs  NIST  to  establish  an  initiative  to  advance  HIT  enterprise  integration  na-
tionally, building on existing efforts at NIST and involving government and industry
consortia.  Technical  activities  of  this  program  may  focus  on  standards  and  inter-
operability  analysis  and  the  development  of  technical  testbeds,  software  conform-
ance  and  certification,  security  and  privacy,  medical  device  communication,  data
management  and  retrieval  architecture,  conformance  testing  infrastructure,  and
health  care  information  usability  and  decision  support.  The  initiative  may  also  in-
clude  assistance  to  outside  organizations  and  federal  agencies  in  developing  tech-
nical  roadmaps  for  HIT  enterprise  integration,  relying  on  voluntary  consensus
standards  where  possible.  The  Director  shall  report  to  Congress  annually  on  these
activities.
Section  3.  Federal  Health  Care  Information  Technology  Systems  and  Infrastructure
Directs  NIST  to  develop  new  or  adopt  existing  technology-neutral  HIT  guidelines
and  standards  for  use  by  federal  agencies  within  six  months  of  enactment.  The
guidelines  and  standards  shall  enable  agencies  to  select  HIT  systems  that  provide
security and privacy and are inter-operable. They shall promote the use of commer-
cial  HIT  systems  by  federal  agencies,  include  conformance-testing  procedures,  pro-
vide privacy profiles, establish inter-operability specifications, and include validation
criteria  to  enable  agencies  to  select  appropriate  HIT  systems.  NIST  will  report  an-
nually on the progress toward and barriers to adoption of inter-operable, secure and
private  HIT  systems  by  federal  agencies.  Directs  the  Department  of  Commerce  to
establish  a  Senior  Interagency  Council  on  Federal  Health  Care  Information  Tech-
nology  Infrastructure,  with  responsibilities  to  coordinate  development  and  deploy-
ment  of  HIT  systems  across  the  Federal  Government,  associated  technology  trans-
fer,  and  federal  funding  for  and  participation  in  private  standards-development  or-
ganizations as related to HIT.
Section 4. Research and Development Programs

Directs NIST, in consultation with NSF, to establish a grant program for institu-
tions  of  higher  education  partnering  with  businesses,  non-profits  and  government
laboratories  to  establish  Centers  for  Health  Care  Information  Enterprise  Integra-
tion.  Grants  shall  be  awarded  on  a  competitive,  merit-reviewed  basis.  The  Centers
will generate innovative approaches to HIT enterprise integration by conducting re-
search  on  the  interfaces  between  human  information  and  communications  tech-
nology  systems,  voice-recognition  systems,  inter-operability  software,  software  de-
pendability,  metrics  of  the  impact  of  information  technology  on  health  care,  health
care  information  enterprise  management,  and  information  technology  security  and
integrity.  Grant  applications  shall  include  descriptions  of  proposed  projects,  efforts

Chairman  GORDON.  I  want  to  welcome  everyone  today.  This
hearing is entitled Meeting the Need for Inter-operability and Infor-
mation Security in Health IT. Before we start with the hearing, we
need to take a moment to deal with some committee business, and
I  am  pleased  to  welcome  two  new  Members  to  our  committee.  The
first  is  from  California.  I  am  pleased  to  welcome  Ms.  Laura  Rich-
ardson to the Committee. She is a new Member, is also on another
committee,  and  will  be  coming  here  soon.  So  we  are  glad  to  have
Ms. Richardson. She was a member of the legislature in California
and brings expertise in that area. And I also want to welcome Mr.
Paul  Broun.  He  brings  particular  expertise  in  that  he  is  a  physi-
cian, and this is a good way to start your first meeting. You should
be  one  of  our  witnesses,  and  we  want  you  to  be  a  full  participant.
And let me say, Dr. Broun, just in quick passing, you haven’t been
here long, but you have been here long enough to know that there
is  a  little  tenseness  in  the  air  sometimes.  We  hope  you  can  find
that  you  can  put  that  aside  and  feel  that  you  can  be  comfortable
in  getting  work  done.  We  have  had  29  bills  out  of  this  committee.
All have been bipartisan. All, but one, have been unanimous. Even
Dr.  Gingrey  had  a  decent  bill  that  came  out  of  here.  There  hasn’t
been  a  Democrat  or  Republican  bill  that  has  been  introduced  that
hasn’t  gotten  prompt  action,  and  we  want  you,  again,  to  use  your
expertise  to  help  us  to  do  an  even  better  job.  And  you  are  sitting
at the right hand of a good mentor, so I would listen to Dr. Ehlers
for his good advice.

And  since  we  have  some  new  Committee  Members,  we  have  to
update  our  Subcommittee  rosters.  The  new  Subcommittee  roster
should be in front of you, and I have asked unanimous consent that
the Committee do ratify the Subcommittee rosters. With that taken
care of, I will now begin my opening statement.

Over  the  past  20  years,  we  have  experienced  a  dramatic  change
in  the  way  we  share  information  because  of  the  rapid  emergence
of  information  technology.  Nearly  every  industry  across  our  econ-
omy  from  financial  services  to  media  to  retail  has  embraced  infor-
mation  technology  and  integrated  it  seamlessly  into  daily  oper-
ations.  Yet  the  health  care  industry  has  lagged  far  behind.  The
broad  use  of  IT  in  the  health  care  sector  could  have  far-reaching
benefits,  including  cost  savings  in  the  billions,  improved  quality  of
care, and fewer dangerous medical errors. Though there are a num-
ber  of  factors  that  have  contributed  to  the  slow  adoption  of  health
IT,  I  believe  one  of  the  most  significant  is  the  lack  of  technical
standards  for  inter-operability  and  the  protection  of  patient  pri-
vacy.

I will also note that this is an area that Newt Gingrich and Hil-
lary Clinton have agreed upon some time back. I now hope that we
can take their agreement and put it into some action. I am sending
copies  of  this  legislation  to  our  fellow  colleague,  Mr.  Gingrich,  and
hope we will have him one day, to come and testify here.

According to most estimates, a fully inter-operable health care IT
system could save U.S. health care tens of billions of dollars a year
and  help  prevent  some  of  the  mistakes  that  lead  to  the  deaths  of
over  98,000  patients  annually.  But  meeting  the  challenge  of  devel-
oping  and  maintaining  such  a  system  is  not  simple.  Most  Ameri-
cans get their primary health care at offices with five or fewer doc-

tors. These small offices cannot easily afford the initial investment
in  health  IT  equipment  and  software  or  the  time  for  training  on
these  complicated  systems.  Doctors  and  health  IT  developers  also
face  medical-privacy  laws  that  vary  state  by  state,  some  of  which
do  not  support  the  digital  exchange  of  patient  information.  Much
more  work  needs  to  be  done  to  update  laws  and  regulations  in
order to encourage the adoption of this important technology.

And  let  me  not  forget  that  Governor  Bredesen  of  Tennessee  and
Governor  Douglas  of  Vermont,  a  Democrat  and  Republican,  have
been  working  on  this  with  the  Governor’s  Association.  We  were  in
contact  with  them  just  the  other  day.  I  hope  that  we  are  going  to
be  able  to  have  inter-operability  between  Congress  and  the  Gov-
ernor’s  Association,  so  they  can  then  push  down  this  uniformity  of
rules and regulations on the local level.

But the biggest barrier to the broad implementation of health IT
systems  is  the  lack  of  technical  standards  to  support  inter-oper-
ability while protecting data security. It is wasteful to start invest-
ing  in  technology  until  we  know  it  is  inter-operable,  as  the  cost  of
upgrading  to  new  systems  could  eat  up  many  immediate  cost  sav-
ings. To achieve inter-operability, we need to have simple technical
standards for data formats, data-exchange protocols and other sys-
tems-communication  needs.  These  will  enable  different  manufac-
turers  and  vendors  to  build  and  sell  medical  software  and  hard-
ware  devices  that  are  based  on  the  same  underlying  communica-
tions  technologies.  Doctors  and  hospitals  are  reluctant  to  invest  in
health care IT systems that are not inter-operable with other such
systems owned by other health care providers.

The National Institute of Standards Technology, NIST, is unique-
ly positioned to meet this challenge. NIST was instrumental in the
guiding the creation of standards for the financial-services industry
and  others  as  they  transitioned  to  an  IT-based  business  model.  It
also sets and maintains the technical standards for the IT security
across  the  Federal  Government  to  protect  against  data  theft  and
unauthorized  access.  That  expertise  is  essential  for  helping  to  cre-
ate inter-operable standards for health care IT.

In addition to discussing the challenges to implement health care
IT  systems  in  the  U.S.,  our  witnesses  today  will  also  address,  I
hope,  H.R.  2406,  which  authorizes  NIST  to  increase  its  efforts  to
support the integration of the health care-information enterprise in
the United States.

This  bill  is  not  a  complete  solution  to  the  problem  we  are  dis-
cussing  today.  But  it  is  my  hope  that  it  is  a  starting  point  for  the
broad efforts needed on the part of the Federal Government, State
governments,  and  health  care  and  IT  industries  to  move  towards
a fully inter-operable health care IT system.

The  bill  is  based  on  the  recommendations  of  a  report  by  the
President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee from 2004
and  a  study  by  the  National  Academies  from  2005.  It  instructs
NIST  to  advance  health  IT  integration  while  working  with  health
care representatives and federal agencies to develop technical road-
maps for health IT standards. The bill also requires NIST to create
or  adopt  existing  technology-neutral  guidelines  and  standards  for
federal  agencies.  It  directs  the  Department  of  Commerce  to  estab-
lish a senior interagency council on federal health IT infrastructure

to coordinate the development and deployment of federal health IT
systems.  And  finally,  it  mandates  a  university-grant  program  at
NIST  for  multi-disciplinary  research  in  health-IT-related  fields.
And thank you, Mr. Wu, for that recommendation.

Secure, inter-operable health care IT systems are critical for sav-
ing time and money. But we cannot lose focus on the ultimate goal
of  all  health  policy,  protecting  patients’  lives  as  well  as  saving
money.

I typically do not tell personal stories during hearings, but if the
Committee  will  indulge  me,  this  drives  home  the  purpose  of  this
legislation.  The  Committee  staffer  who  has  been  handling  health
IT  issues  is  a  gentleman  named  Mike  Quear,  a  very  able,  capable,
bright  public  servant.  Last  year,  Mike  had  an  open-heart  surgery
and  was  diagnosed  with  diabetes.  He  was  concerned  what  would
happen  if  he  ever  needed  emergency  care,  so  he  started  keeping  a
record  of  every  condition  that  he  had,  every  specialist  that  he  had
visited,  and  every  medication  that  he  was  prescribed  on  a  small
card in his wallet. Unfortunately, that card became larger and larg-
er  as  he  had  additional  situations.  That  card  was  the  only  com-
prehensive record of care that Mike had available to him. This past
August,  Mike  had  a  stroke  and  was  taken  to  the  hospital  where
emergency room doctors were immediately able to evaluate his pre-
existing  conditions,  contact  Mike’s  team  of  specialists  and  provide
him  with  the  best  care,  because  they  had  that  card.  Now,  thank-
fully, he is now recovering at home, and we welcome him and want
him back to finish this legislation. But if those records hadn’t been
available,  who  knows  what  might  have  happened.  I  would  venture
to  guess  that  not  many  people  in  this  room  or  in  this  county  take
the  time  to  record  their  medical  history  on  a  wallet  card,  nor
should  we  need  to.  Technology  in  this  country  is  far  enough  ad-
vanced that we should be able to expect doctors to access our com-
plete medical records in any emergency situation.

So I am eager to hear our witnesses’ thoughts and recommenda-
tions on how to most effectively promote the broad implementation
of health information technology systems in the near future to save
money, to save time, and to save lives.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BART GORDON

I want to welcome everyone to today’s hearing on Meeting the Need for Inter-oper-
ability and Information Security in Health IT. Over the past 20 years, we have expe-
rienced  a  dramatic  change  in  the  way  we  share  information  because  of  the  rapid

including cost savings in the billions, improved quality of care, and fewer dangerous
medical errors.

Though  there  are  a  number  of  factors  that  have  contributed  to  slow  adoption  of
health  IT,  I  believe  one  of  the  most  significant  is  the  lack  of  technical  standards
for inter-operability and the protection of patient privacy.

Inter-operable communications for the exchange of information are a requirement
for conducting business across the country and around the globe. Unfortunately, the
health  care  industry  has  not  yet  adopted  common  standards  to  allow  for  the  broad
management and transmission of health related information.

the mistakes that lead to the deaths of over 98,000 patients annually.

But  meeting  the  challenge  of  developing  and  maintaining  such  a  system  is  not

doctors.  These  small  offices  cannot  easily  afford  the  initial  investment  in  health  IT

and health IT systems developers also face medical privacy laws that vary state by

Much more work needs to be done to update laws and regulations in order to en-

courage the adoption of this important technology.

But  the  biggest  barrier  to  the  broad  implementation  of  health  IT  systems  is  the
lack  of  technical  standards  to  support  inter-operability  while  protecting  data  secu-
rity.

It  is  wasteful  to  start  investing  in  technology  until  we  know  it  is  inter-operable,
as  the  cost  to  upgrade  to  new  systems  would  eat  up  any  immediate  cost  savings.

different  manufacturers  and  vendors  to  build  and  sell  medical  software  and  hard-
ware  devices  that  are  based  on  the  same  underlying  communication  techniques.
Doctors and hospitals are reluctant to invest in health IT systems that are not inter-
operable with other such systems owned by other health care providers.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is uniquely positioned

to meet this challenge.

NIST was instrumental in guiding the creation of standards for the financial serv-
ices  industry  and  others  as  they  transitioned  to  an  IT-based  business  model.  NIST

is essential for helping to create inter-operability standards for health IT.

In  addition  to  discussing  the  challenges  of  implementing  a  health  IT  system  in
the  U.S.,  our  witnesses  today  will  be  addressing  H.R.  2406,  which  authorizes  NIST
to increase its efforts to support the integration of the health care information enter-
prise in the United States.

This bill is not a complete solution to the problem we are discussing today.
But  it  is  my  hope  that  it  is  a  starting  point  for  the  broad  efforts  needed  on  the
part of the Federal Government, State governments, and the health care and IT in-
dustries to move towards a fully inter-operable national health IT system.

The  bill  is  based  on  the  recommendations  of  a  report  by  the  President’s  Informa-
tion  Technology  Advisory  Committee  (PITAC)  in  2004  and  a  study  by  the  National
Academies  in  2005.  It  instructs  NIST  to  advance  health  IT  integration  while  work-
ing with health care representatives and federal agencies to develop technical road-
maps for health IT standards.

The  bill  also  requires  NIST  to  create  or  adopt  existing  technology-neutral  guide-
lines  and  standards  for  federal  agencies.  It  directs  the  Department  of  Commerce  to
establish  a  Senior  Interagency  Council  on  Federal  Health  IT  Infrastructure  to  co-
ordinate  the  development  and  deployment  of  federal  HIT  systems.  And  finally,  it
mandates  a  university  grant  program  at  NIST  for  multi-disciplinary  research  in
health IT-related fields.

Secure,  inter-operable  health  IT  systems  are  crucial  for  saving  time  and  money.
But  we  cannot  lose  focus  on  the  ultimate  goal  of  all  health  policy:  protecting  pa-
tients’ health and saving lives.

I  typically  do  not  tell  personal  stories  during  hearings,  but  if  the  Committee  will
indulge me, I want to share a story that drives home the purpose of this legislation.
The  Committee  staffer  who  has  been  handling  health  IT  issues  for  me  is  a  gen-
tleman  named  Mike  Quear.  Last  year,  Mike  had  open  heart  surgery  and  was  diag-
nosed with diabetes. He was concerned what would happen if he ever needed emer-
gency care, so he started keeping a record of every condition that he had, every spe-
cialist  he  visited,  and  every  medication  he  was  prescribed  on  a  small  card  in  his
wallet.

to. Technology in this country is far enough advanced that we should be able to ex-
pect doctors to access our complete medical records in any emergency situation.

I’m  eager  to  hear  our  witnesses’  thoughts  and  recommendations  on  how  to  most
effectively  promote  the  broad  implementation  of  health  information  technology  sys-
tems in the near future to save money, save time, and save lives.

Chairman.  GORDON.  Mr.  Chair—the  Chair  now  recognizes  Mr.

Hall for an opening statement.

Mr. HALL. You can call me Mr. Chair if you want to.
Mr. Chairman, I thank you for a good opening statement, and I,
too,  look  forward  to  learning  more  about  health  information  tech-
nology  inter-operability  and  information  security  as  well  as  about
your bill, H.R. 2406, this morning from our various esteemed panel
of witnesses.

As a long-term supporter of Mike, what wonderful guy he is, and
of course, we keep him in our prayers, and I admire him for keep-
ing that list there. I started doing that some-80 years ago, and my
list got so heavy, I couldn’t lift it, but Mike is a wonderful guy. He
has  rendered  great  service  to  this  committee  and  to  this  Congress
and to our nation, and we have him on our prayer list.

And Mr. Chairman, as a long-term supporter of initiative such as
Tele-health for rural communities, I understand the value of health
information technologies, and many sectors of our economy rely on
information  technology  to  increase  efficiency  and  minimize  errors.
The  health  care  sector  should  not  be  different.  We  invest  1.7  tril-
lion,  annually,  in  health  care,  and  yet  the  system  is  plagued  with
inefficiency.  A  recent  Rand  Corporation  study  stated  that  if  most
hospitals  and  doctor  offices  adopted  health  information  technology,
the  efficiency  savings  alone  would  average  over  $77  billion  a  year.
Of course, the good things they do far outnumber the inefficiencies,
but  we,  at  a  time  like  this,  point  up  the  lack  of  efficiencies  and
hope to look to you as one, two, three, four—five people that know
more  about  it  than  we  do  or  you  wouldn’t  be  there  because  we
write  our  legislation  based  on  your  information  and  how  you  back
it up, and then we battle it pro or con.

But the study found that if hospitals implemented a health infor-
mation  technology  system  around  200,000  adverse-drug  events
could be eliminated if they did. It could eliminate that many annu-
ally.  Despite  these  obvious  benefits,  developing  a  nationwide  HIT
network  is  expensive,  and  of  course,  as  the  Chairman  said,  it  is
challenging.  One  of  the  biggest  challenges,  I  guess,  involves  shar-
ing  information  from  system  to  system,  also  known  as  inter-oper-
ability.  We  have  to  develop  inter-operable  standards  so  that  the
systems being developed today and tomorrow will function together
smoothly, and in order to address this need, President Bush estab-
lished the Office of the National Coordinator at the Department of
Health  and  Human  Services,  and  that  office  has  put  together  a
consortium with public and private entitles, including NIST, to de-
velop  inter-operability  and  conformance  standards.  This  consor-
tium,  the  American  Health  Information  Community,  AHIC,  has
been  working  over  the  last  few  years  on  this  very  important  task,
and  I  applaud  your  efforts  at  bringing  a  health  information  tech-
nology  bill  before  this  committee,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  would  like
to  know  more  about  H.R.  2406  and  how  it  will  affect  the  process
currently underway at the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices. For instance, it appears that the bill would give NIST overall

authority  for  writing  standards,  procedures  and  guidelines  for  the
health  care  industry.  If  that  is  the  case,  I  wonder  whether  NIST
is the best vehicle for full-scale adoption of standards. While I cer-
tainly  agree  that  NIST  has  a  role  to  play,  it  is  my  understanding
that  NIST  has  never  before  been  a  body  that  has  set  policy.  In-
stead, they have taken an agreed-upon policy and set about stand-
ardizing  it.  Since  there  is  already  a  vehicle  in  place  setting  policy
at  AHIC,  will  this  bill  derail  that  process,  or  will  this  legislation
establish a parallel process between the two agencies, and addition-
ally,  I  am  not  sure  on  where  the  money  will  come  from  for  NIST
to undertake HIT initiatives. Would it have to come at the expense
of  other  NIST  projects  and  priorities?  The  Administration  asked
Congress for $118 million for fiscal year 2008 for HIT, and it looks
like  Congress  will  appropriate  somewhere  between  $60  and  $70
million.  Will  NIST  projects  be  cut  in  order  to  complete  with  what
the  Administration  has  already  undertaken?  That  is  a  question
that  I  hope  we  can  answer  today.  I  think  it  is  clear  that  we  are
all  seeking  to  improve  Health  Information  Technology  Systems  as
quickly and as smoothly as possible, and I look forward to hearing
from  all  of  the  witnesses  on  this  important  topic,  and  Mr.  Chair-
man, I really do thank you and yield back the balance of my time.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Hall follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RALPH M. HALL

Mr.  Chairman,  I  look  forward  to  learning  more  about  Health  Information  Tech-
nology, Inter-operability and Information Security, as well about your bill H.R. 2406
this morning from our esteemed panel of witnesses.

As  a  longtime  supporter  of  initiatives  such  as  telehealth  for  rural  communities,
I understand the value of Health Information Technology. Many sectors of our econ-
omy  rely  on  information  technology  to  increase  efficiency  and  minimize  errors.  The
health  care  sector  should  not  be  different.  We  invest  over  $1.7  trillion  annually  in
health  care,  and  yet  the  system  is  plagued  with  inefficiency.  A  recent  RAND  Cor-
poration  study  stated  that  if  most  hospitals  and  doctors’  offices  adopted  Health  In-
formation  Technology,  the  efficiency  savings  alone  would  average  over  $77  billion
a  year.  Moreover,  the  study  found  that  if  hospitals  implemented  a  Health  Informa-
tion  Technology  system,  around  200,000  adverse  drug  events  could  be  eliminated
annually.

Despite these obvious benefits, developing a nationwide HIT network is expensive
and  challenging.  One  of  the  biggest  challenges  involves  sharing  information  from
system  to  system,  also  known  as  inter-operability.  We  must  develop  inter-operable
standards so that the systems being developed today and tomorrow will function to-
gether  smoothly.  In  order  to  address  this  need,  President  Bush  established  the  Of-
fice  of  the  National  Coordinator  at  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services
and that office has put together a consortium of public and private entities, includ-
ing NIST, to develop inter-operability and conformance standards. This consortium,
the  American  Health  Information  Community  (AHIC)  has  been  working  over  the
last few years on this important task.

I applaud your efforts at bringing a Health Information Technology bill before this
committee, and I would like to know more about how H.R. 2406 will affect the proc-
ess  currently  underway  at  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services.  For  in-
stance, it appears that the bill would give NIST overall authority for writing stand-
ards,  procedures  and  guidelines  for  the  health  care  industry  If  that  is  the  case,  I
wonder  whether  NIST  is  the  best  vehicle  for  full  scale  adoption  of  HIT  standards.
While  I  certainly  agree  that  NIST  has  a  role  to  play,  NIST  has  never  before  been
a  body  that  has  set  policy.  Instead,  they  have  taken  an  agreed  upon  policy  and  set
about standardizing it. Since there is already a vehicle in place that is setting policy
at HHS, will this bill derail that process? Or will this legislation establish a parallel
process between two agencies?

Additionally, I am unclear on where the money will come from for NIST to under-
take HIT initiatives. Will it have to come at the expense of other NIST projects and
priorities?  The  Administration  asked  Congress  for  $118  million  for  FY  ’08  for  HIT,
and  it  looks  like  Congress  will  appropriate  somewhere  around  $60  to  $70  million

dollars. Will NIST projects be cut in order to compete with what the Administration
has already undertaken?

I  think  that  it  is  clear  that  we  are  all  seeking  to  improve  Health  Information
Technology Systems as quickly and as smoothly as possible. I look forward to hear-
ing  from  all  the  witnesses  on  this  important  topic.  Thank  you  Mr.  Chairman,  and
I yield back the balance of my time.

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Hall.  I  think  you  raised
some very important issues. Let me make it very clear that we are
not  interested  in  NIST  setting  any  kind  of  policy.  That  should  not
be  the  case,  but  rather,  setting  standards,  not  picking  winners  or
losers, but rather setting standards. They also have the entire situ-
ation—they  have  tests  so  once  those  standards  are  developed  for
both  hardware  and  software  they  can  get  the  Good  Housekeeping
Seal of Approval, so that a small firm or a large hospital can invest
with the certainty that they are not going to have to see this tech-
nology  be  obsolete  soon.  So  you  raised  some  good  questions,  and  I
know those are things we want to get into.

Since  this  is  a  hearing  starting  at  the  Full  Committee  level—we
typically  go  through  regular  order  of  bringing  things  up  through
the  Subcommittees.  But  by  virtue  of  the  interest  in  this  particular
topic, we decided to start at the Full Committee level, but I would
like to hear from our Subcommittee Chairman. I would like to now
yield to Mr. Wu for his opening remarks.

Mr.  WU.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  thank  you  for  holding

this very important hearing.

The  health  sciences  continually  push  the  envelope  in  new  tech-
nologies, new medicine and new research; however, health care sys-
tems lag far behind in information technology capabilities. In an in-
creasingly digital society, paper records are still a primary mode of
information  transfer  in  health  care.  Improving  health  care  IT  will
make  health  care  more  efficient,  safer  for  patients,  and  a  better
practice  environment  for  health  care  professionals  and  may  wind
up  saving  some  money.  We  need  technical  standards  to  create  a
functional,  inter-operable  IT  network,  and  we  should  enhance  the
relationship  between  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Serv-
ices  and  NIST  so  that  they  can  work  together  to  create  the  stand-
ards of the future.

As the government agency which is responsible for creating tech-
nical  standards,  NIST  is  well  equipped  to  address  health  care  IT
standards for inter-operability and security. I often note the impor-
tant  role  of  NIST  in  metrology.  If  you  can’t  measure  something,  it
is not really real in terms of science or economics. Similarly, NIST
plays a critical role for inter-operability. If there are not standards
to guide folks, creating inter-operable IT systems will be extremely
difficult, if at all possible. While digitizing medical information will
increase  efficiency,  we  must  also  address  the  issue  of  security.
NIST  can  also  properly  develop  standards  that  not  only  address
inter-operability but the need for proper security measures as well;
it has done so in the past.

I  commend  Chairman  Gordon  for  his  work  to  address  the  issue
of  health  care  IT  by  introducing  H.R.  2406.  This  bill  will  increase
inter-operability  and  security  in  health  care  IT  by  directing  NIST
to continue its work in developing standards.

Earlier  this  year,  the  House  passed  my  bill  to  train  health  care
IT  professionals,  who  are  knowledgeable  in  both  information  tech-

nology  and  in  health  care  so  that  new  IT  systems  don’t  sit  on
desktops  as  dark  boxes.  As  we  move  forward  with  the  Chairman’s
bill  and  develop  secure,  inter-operable  IT  systems,  we  need  to  en-
sure  these  systems  can  be  developed  and  implemented  by  trained
professionals.

Again,  I  commend  the  Chairman  for  his  fine  work  and  look  for-

ward to the testimony of the witnesses.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Wu follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN DAVID WU

The  field  of  medicine  continually  pushes  the  envelope  in  new  technologies,  new
medicine,  new  research—which  improves  our  overall  ability  to  stay  healthy.  How-
ever,  health  care  systems  lag  far  behind  in  information  technology  capabilities.  In
an  increasingly  digital  society,  handwritten  records  are  still  a  primary  mode  of
record keeping in health care. Improving health care IT will make health care more
efficient,  while  minimizing  medical  errors—reducing  health  care  costs  and  ulti-
mately saving lives.

We  need  technical  standards  to  create  a  functional,  inter-operable  IT  network.  I
am  pleased  with  the  relationship  between  HHS  and  NIST.  As  the  government,
which  is  responsible  for  creating  technical  standards,  NIST  is  well  equipped  to  ad-
dress Health IT standards for inter-operability and security.

I  often  note  the  importance  of  NIST’s  role  in  metrology.  If  you  cannot  measure
something,  it  does  not  exist.  Similarly,  NIST  plays  a  critical  role  for  inter-oper-
ability.  If  there  is  no  standard  to  follow,  creating  an  inter-operable  IT  system  will
be difficult.

While digitizing medical information will increase efficiency, we must also address
the  issue  of  security.  The  sensitive  data  of  personal  medical  records  requires  suffi-
cient  security  measures  are  taken  into  consideration.  NIST  can  also  develop  stand-
ards  that  not  only  address  inter-operability,  but  the  need  for  proper  security  meas-
ures as well.

I  commend  Chairman  Gordon’s  for  his  work  to  address  the  issue  of  Health  Care
IT by introducing H.R. 2406. This bill will help inter-operability and security issues
in  Health  Care  IT  by  directing  NIST  to  continue  its  work  in  developing  standards.
Earlier  this  bill,  the  House  passed  a  bill  that  will  provide  technical  training  to
health  care  professionals  regarding  Health  Care  IT.  As  we  move  forward  with  the
Chairman’s  bill,  and  develop  secure  inter-operable  IT  systems,  we  need  to  ensure
these systems can be implemented by trained staff.

I look forward to the testimony of the witnesses, and I yield back.
Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Wu.  In  continuing  to  try  to
answer  some  of  Mr.  Hall’s  very  legitimate  questions—one  was
about  funding,  and  I  just  want  to  state  that  the  COMPETES  Act
that  was  passed  overwhelming  by  Congress  and  signed  by  the
President  this  August  put  NIST  on  track  to  double  over  the  next
seven  years,  and  we  hope  this  will  be  a  part  of  that,  although  not
take seven years.

And  Ms.  Richardson,  we  welcomed  you  with  great  flair  in
absentia earlier, but let me once again point out that Ms. Richard-
son, as a member of the State legislature in California, comes with
a lot of background and expertise. Also as a freshman she had her
choice  of  a  lot  of  committees,  and  she  was  a  top  draft  choice  be-
cause  she  did  come  with  such  a  good  background,  and  we  are
pleased that you chose the Science Committee as one of those com-
mittees.  So  welcome,  and  you  are  an  official  Member  of  this  com-
mittee now.

Ms. RICHARDSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  GORDON.  And  Dr.  Gingrey,  now  we  welcome  your

opening testimony.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you,  and  certainly,  I  do  ap-
preciate you giving Chairman Wu and I additional time to address
today’s hearing.

As  you  know,  Health  Information  Technology  is  a  topic  of  great
importance to me as a physician member, and so I certainly appre-
ciate  your  holding  of  this  hearing,  Mr.  Chairman,  on  developing
inter-operability  standards  for  health  information  technology,  an
area, as has already been said, of critical importance to our health
care system, and an area with so much untapped potential.

Health  Information  Technology  is  one  of  the  most  promising
ways  to  tackle  today’s  problems  with  skyrocketing  health  care
costs.  It  has  been  mentioned  by  some  of  my  colleagues  in  regard
to  the  cost  savings,  but  I  am  quoting  an  even  bigger  number  and
this  is  based  on  a  recently  ran  study  revealing  that  inter-operable
HIT  system,  if  it  is  implemented  correctly,  and  of  course,  widely
adopted,  could/would  save  the  American  health  care  system  more
than $162 billion annually. So that is maybe a little bit more than
our  Ranking  Member  Hall  had  said.  But  who  knows?  Whether  it
is $77 billion or $160 billion, you are talking about a lot of money.
I mean there is potential for some huge savings in cost.

Of course, in addition, there are numerous other advantages that
are  also  extremely  compelling.  Properly  implemented,  HIT  would
enormously  increase  the  efficiency  within  our  health  care  system
by  increasing  access  to  things  like  offsite  charting  and  flagging  of
charts  for  follow-up  on  recommended  procedure.  It  has  the  poten-
tial to eliminate duplicate testing that wastes patients’ money and
times, and yes, often causes patients unnecessary pain and discom-
fort.  As  the  Chairman  was  talking  about  in  reference  to  our  great
staff  member  Michael,  what  could  have  happened  had  he  not  had
the  foresight  to  have  that  record  on  his  person?  Even  more  vital
is the possibility of eliminating medical errors. And not sure of this
estimate  by  the  National  Institute  of  Medicine  is  correct,  but  a
number  of  years  ago,  they  come  out  with  a  study  and  said  some-
thing  like  90,000  deaths  occur  in  a  hospital  setting  on  an  annual
basis  because  of  medical  errors.  It  may  not  be  90,000,  but  if  it  is
9,000 it is too many.

So I see two important roles for the government in Health Infor-
mation  Technology.  First,  we  must  make  sure  that  every  provider
is  able  to  adopt  HIT.  And  secondly,  we  must  ensure  that  the  tech-
nology  and  standards—this  is  what  the  Chairman’s  bill  is  about—
that  the  technology  and  standards  measure  up  to  the  21st  century
standards  so  that  Health  Information  Technology  is  implemented
properly and promptly so that we get the right software.

In  regard  to  the  first  issue,  I  want  to  maybe  toot  my  own  bill  a
little  bit  and  let  you  know  that  I  am  sponsoring  H.R.  1952  in  col-
laborating with Charles Gonzales of Texas. He is the Subcommittee
Chairman on the Small Business Committee. This bill is called the
National  Health  Information  Incentive  Act  of  2007.  The  bill  that  I
had  introduced  as  a  stand-alone  is  a  section  of  Chairman
Gonzales’s bill, but it would encourage HIT adoption by proving op-
tional financial incentives to small health care providers and incen-
tives  to  implement  such  an  infrastructure.  And  I  am  so  glad  that
Chairman  Gordon  has  called  this  hearing  to  explore  the  second
part of this process, the creation and implementation of HIT inter-

operability standards. It is vital that these standards are developed
in  the  most  efficient  way  to  ensure  that  HIT  is  not  only  imple-
mented  quickly  but  properly  and  promptly.  And  I  am  looking  for-
ward,  Mr.  Chairman,  to  hearing  from  our  witnesses,  and  I  thank
them all for being here today.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Gingrey follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE PHIL GINGREY

Mr.  Chairman,  I  appreciate  your  giving  Chairman  Wu  and  I  additional  time  to
address  today’s  hearing.  As  you  know,  health  information  technology  is  a  topic  of
great  importance  to  me  as  a  physician  Member  of  this  body—so  I  appreciate  your
holding  this  hearing  on  developing  inter-operability  standards  for  Health  Informa-
tion  Technology—an  area  of  critical  importance  to  our  health  care  system  and  an
area with so much untapped potential.

Health  Information  Technology  is  one  of  the  most  promising  ways  to  tackle  to-
day’s  problem  of  skyrocketing  health  care  costs.  A  recent  RAND  study  reveals  that
an  inter-operable  HIT  system  that  is  implemented  correctly  and  widely  adopted
would save the American health care system more than $162 billion annually.

In  addition,  there  are  numerous  other  advantages  that  are  also  very  compelling.
Properly  implemented  HIT  would  enormously  increase  the  efficiency  within  our
health  care  system  by  increasing  access  to  off-site  charting  and  flagging  charts  for
follow-up  on  recommended  procedures.  It  has  the  potential  to  eliminate  duplicate
testing that wastes patients’ money and time and often causes patients unnecessary
pain and discomfort. Even more vital is the possibility of eliminating medical errors
that that lead to almost 100,000 deaths each year.

I  see  important  roles  for  the  government  in  promoting  Health  Information  Tech-
nology. First we must make sure that every provider is able to adopt HIT. Secondly,
we  must  ensure  that  the  technology  and  standards  measure  up  to  21st  century
standards so that health information technology is implemented properly to promote
the inter-operability of HIT software.

To  address  the  first  issue  I  am  sponsoring  H.R.  1952,  in  collaboration  with  Rep.
Charles Gonzales from Texas. This bill is called the National Health Information In-
centive Act of 2007. My bill would encourage HIT adoption by providing optional fi-
nancial incentives to small health care providers and entities to implement such an
infrastructure.

I am so glad that Chairman Gordon has called this hearing to explore the second
part of this process, the creation and implementation of HIT inter-operability stand-
ards.  It  is  vital  that  these  standards  are  developed  in  the  most  efficient  way  to  en-
sure that HIT is not only implemented quickly but properly.

I  want  to  again  thank  the  Chairman  for  taking  the  initiative  on  this  important

matter, and look forward the witness testimony.

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Gingrey.  I  know  you  would
rather hear them than me. But I am so passionate about his. I just
want  to  follow  up  on  something  you  said  about  the  savings.  You
know, right now, we spend more per capita on health care than any
other nation in the world, yet as you know, we are struggling—we
have different ways we want to do it—but struggling to get all chil-
dren  to  be  able  to  have  health  care.  Right  now,  as  you  well  know,
there is a 10 percent cut looming for doctors in terms of their Medi-
care  reimbursement.  But  it  is  the  fastest-growing  part  of  the  fed-
eral  expense;  it  is  the  fastest-growing  part  of  our  individual—in
most cases, our expenses. But we are already spending so much as
a  nation;  it  is  hard  to  just  keep  stacking  more  money  on.  And  so
if  we  are  going  to  meet  these  needs,  we  have  got  to  find  a  way  to
find  efficiencies  within  this  system.  This  is  a  way.  We  don’t  know
whether  it  is  tens  of  billions  or  hundreds  of  billions,  but  we  know
it is many billons of dollars that can be saved, and with these sav-
ings, hopefully we can capture and use those for those other needs
within this health care system that are so important to our nation.
And  so  we  are  going  to  work  together  on  this  bill.  We  have  got

other  bills  we  are  going  to  work  together  on,  and  I  think  we  are
going to meet those needs.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  calling  today’s  important  hearing  to  examine  the
need  for  inter-operability  and  information  security  in  health  care  information  tech-
nology (HIT) and legislation that authorizes the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) to increase its efforts in this area.

The  Science  and  Technology  Committee  strives  to  accelerate  research,  develop-
ment, and advancements in new technology and processes. With all of the advance-
ments in medicine and tools in the medical industry, it is shocking to see more than
98,000  people  in  hospitals  die  from  medical  errors,  including  incorrect  medications
or improper diagnosis. Further, it is frustrating that because of high costs, at a time
when  our  nation  has  access  to  the  most  sophisticated  health  care  technology,  as
much as 49 percent of clinical diagnostic testing is performed due to the lack of ac-
cessibility  to  previous  test  results.  These  issues  can  be  addressed  and  I  believe  we
owe it to the American people to find solutions to the current challenges in success-
fully implementing HIT.

Having  stated  the  above,  there  are  obvious  vital  areas,  such  as  unifying  national
standards,  developing  security  protections  to  ensure  patient’s  information,  and  ad-
dressing  the  financial  costs  associated  with  research,  development,  and  full  imple-
mentation of HIT, that must be addressed.

Technological  advancements  in  the  health  care  industry  have  been  enormous.
Today, I believe we will hear many of the great accomplishments that have occurred
in working towards HIT as well as the challenges we must overcome to successfully
implement HIT. I believe we must identify and recognize the work that we have ac-
complished up to this point and be cautious as to not undo these advances. Instead,
we  should  build  around  them  with  a  focus  on  the  barriers  that  exist  to  succeeding
in implementing such a system.

I  thank  the  witnesses  for  appearing  before  our  committee  and  look  forward  to

their testimony.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Mitchell follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE HARRY E. MITCHELL

Mr. Chairman,

Thank you for organizing this morning’s hearing on inter-operability and security
in health care information technology. This is an issue that has come up in my work
on  the  Committee  on  Veterans  Affairs.  The  Departments  of  Veterans’  Affairs  and
Defense  are  working  on  some  demonstration  projects  in  this  area  and  I  am  eager
to learn if we are applying any of the lessons learned from their effort on a system
wide basis.

To  date,  the  Federal  Government  has  struggled  to  develop  and  define  widely  ac-
ceptable  technology  for  a  national,  inter-operable  health  care  technology  system.  In
2004, the Department of Health and Human Services was charged to take the lead
in  developing  and  implementing  a  nationwide  inter-operable  health  IT  (HIT)  infra-
structure  to  improve  quality  and  efficiency  in  health  care.  One  obstacle  inhibiting
progress in this effort is the lack of widely accepted technical standards.

The  lead  agency  for  developing  and  disseminating  technical  standards  is  the  Na-
tional  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST).  Developing  technical  stand-
ards  that  work  is  NIST’s  expertise.  It  is  experienced  in  dealing  with  issues  of  sys-
tems inter-operability, data security, privacy issues, and standards development.

The  subject  of  health  information  technology  produces  an  eye-glazing  effect  on
most Americans. Nonetheless, it is a critical factor to making our health care system
more efficient and economical and to improving the quality of patient care.

Research  conducted  by  the  Committee  staff  in  preparation  for  this  hearing  notes
that  ‘‘98,000  Americans  die  and  more  than  one  million  patients  suffer  each  year  as
a result of broken health care practices and system failures.’’ Improvements in infor-
mation technology can reduce the incidence of medical error, produce billions in sav-
ings in health care expenditures, and better protect patients. The significance of this
matter  cannot  be  understated. . .improvements  in  health  care  information  tech-
nology is critical to patient safety.

I look forward to hearing from today’s witnesses, especially in regard to legislation
our  esteemed  Chairman  has  introduced,  H.R.  2406,  a  bill  designed  to  support

Mr.  Chairman,  that  concludes  my  remarks,  and  I  yield  back  the  balance  of  my

time.

Chairman  GORDON.  Now,  at  this  time,  I  would  like  to  introduce

our witnesses. We are glad you are here.

Dr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, thank you for giving me that oppor-
tunity, and the opportunity to have a witness from my district, the
11th  of  Georgia,  the  Northwest  portion  of  the  State.  I  have  nine
counties,  and  our  witness  is  from  Carrollton,  Georgia,  in  Carroll
County,  almost-Alabama,  I  call  it.  But  that  is  Mr.  Justin  Barnes.
I  have  known  Justin  for  a  number  of  years.  He  has  worked  very
diligently  as  Vice  President  of  marketing  and  corporate  develop-
ment  and  government  affairs  for  the  Greenway  Medical  Tech-
nologies Company in Carrollton, Georgia, and they develop a lot of
software  programs  and  have  been  at  this  for  a  number  of  years.
They  have  recruited,  actually,  some  general  surgeons  and  some
OB–GYNs from the community and have many, many years of clin-
ical  experience  and  practice  who  are  now  working  with  the  com-
pany  in  the  development—well,  actually  they  have  developed  very
impressive  software  programs  for  those  specialties  in  particular,
general surgery and OB–GYN, and it is something that is out there
on the market and working very well. Justin is such a smart young
man,  I  thought,  surely,  he  was  a  graduate  of  Georgia  Tech,  but  I
had  to  go  over  and  speak  to  him  to  make  sure  about  that.  And  he
said,  no,  Congressman,  I  am  a  graduate  of  U.  Mass.  I  won’t  try  to
Massachusetts, because I don’t do very good—but a graduate of U.
Mass in legal studies. And I very proud to welcome one of our wit-
nesses, Mr. Justin Barnes from Greenway. Thank you.

Chairman  GORDON.  And  do  you  know,  did  he  have  a  son  that
played  on  the  Little  League  team?  Didn’t  you  just  win  the  world’s
championship? And that is what? Two out of three?

Dr.  GINGREY.  That  is  right,  Mr.  Chairman,  two  out  of  three.  I
think one time Macon, and this last time Columbia, not Carrolton,
but pretty close.

Eye  Care  Group  in  New  Haven,  Connecticut,  where  I  am  also  a
clinical  professor  of  ophthalmology  and  visual  science  at  the  Yale
School  of  Medicine  and  the  assistant  chief  of  ophthalmology  at
Yale-New Haven Hospital. I serve as the Chair of the American So-
ciety  of  Cataract  and  Refractive  Surgery’s  (ASCRS)  Subcommittee
on Health Information Technology as well as the ASCRS liaison to
the  American  Society  of  Ophthalmic  Administrators  Executive
Board.  Today,  I  am  here  representing  the  Alliance  of  Specialty
Medicine,  a  coalition  of  11  medical  societies,  representing  nearly
200,000 specialty physicians.

First,  we  would  like  to  thank  you  for  your  efforts  to  advance
health  information  technology,  HIT,  legislation  and  for  including
specialty  physicians  in  the  development  process.  We  believe  that
your legislation, H.R. 2406, which authorizes the National Institute
of Standards and Technology to enhance efforts to integrate health
information  enterprises  in  the  United  States,  will  help  to  promote
the widespread adoption of effective HIT. Health information tech-
nology  has  the  potential  to  increase  efficiency  and  quality  of  care,
but  this  cannot  be  achieved  until  we  have  effective  standards  of
communication  and  interaction  among  systems.  In  addition,  the
technology  has  the  potential,  as  you  have  all  indicated,  to  signifi-
cantly lower costs in the health care industry. In addition, we sup-
port  the  development  of  an  electronic-information  network  that  is
reliable, inter-operable, secure, and protects patient privacy.

Specialty  physicians  have  been  and  continue  to  be  actively  en-
gaged  in  the  quality-improvement  area.  Through  the  development
of  measure  specifications  for  service  and  the  development  of  a  ra-
tional system for collecting, aggregating, and reporting data across
numerous  public  and  private  insurance  programs  in  the  least  bur-
densome  way,  we  have  played  a  pivotal  role  in  shaping  the  future
of  our  health  care-delivery  system.  However,  in  order  to  continue
making  progress  in  these  areas,  we  believe  that  specialty  physi-
cians,  and  indeed  all  health  care  providers,  must  employ  reliable
and secure HIT systems. These systems are a needed and an essen-
tial component that will help us to continue to participate in these
programs  and  to  improve  the  quality  of  care  we  provide  to  our  pa-

tients.  In  addition,  these  systems  will  help  us  to  harness  medical
knowledge to enable health care providers to deliver the most effec-
tive  and  up-to-date  medical  information  in  an  efficient  and  cost-ef-
fective manner.

As  you  know,  the  adoption  of  electronic  health  care  records  and
other  health-related  information  technology  has  been  slow  to  say
the  least.  According  to  the  e-Health  Initiative,  the  health  care  in-
dustry invests only two percent of its revenues in IT, whereas other
information-intensive  industries,  such  as  financial  services,  invest
11 percent of revenues in IT in order to improve the quality, diver-
sity and efficiency of their products and services. We agree that in
this  age  of  rapid  technology  advancement,  the  slow  adoption  of
health  IT  by  the  health  care  industry  is  undesirable.  The  absence
of an efficient HIT system is hampering the integration of effective
treatment  plans  into  mainstream  medicine,  the  effective  and  effi-
cient evaluation of current practices and efforts to improve both the
quality of medical care and the cost-effectiveness of health care de-
livery.  We  believe  that  an  effective  quality-improvement  program
must incorporate the use of HIT while recognizing the considerable
administrative costs that physicians and other health professionals
would incur for participating in such a program.

Most  physicians  and  other  health  professionals  lack  the  nec-
essary  health  IT  and  administrative  infrastructures  to  participate
in  the  majority  of  quality-improvement  programs  for  physician
services.  As  you  know,  the  typical  American  small  physician  prac-
tices  and  physicians  not  employed  by  large  institutions  will  con-
tinue  to  face  challenges  in  financing  the  purchase  of  integrated
HIT  systems.  In  addition,  many  progressive  practices  that  were
early  adopters  of  HIT  are  now  finding  themselves  with  costly  sys-
tems  that  are  now  out  of  date.  The  cost  of  updating  these  systems
will  be  too  great  to  bear  in  the  light  of  the  pending  health  care
service  reimbursement  reductions  and  the  lack  of  inter-operability
standards.  Most  physicians  do  not  have  HIT  systems  and  are
watching  and  waiting.  They  do  not  feel  confident  making  such  a
large  investment  in  health  IT  because  of  the  cost  and  the  uncer-
tainty of future system compatibility.

Therefore, as Congress addresses this legislation and similar leg-
islation  in  the  future,  we  hope  that  additional  efforts  to  promote
health  IT  and  inter-operability  include  more  financial  assistance
for  physicians  to  obtain  HIT.  Efforts  to  ease  the  burden  on  physi-
cians seeking to purchase health information technology, especially
in  the  face  of  annual  updates  below  medical  inflation  due  to  the
falling sustainable growth rate formula are greatly appreciated and
also essential.

Your  bill,  which  would  accelerate  the  development  of  inter-oper-
ability  guidelines  and  standards  is  both  a  necessary  and  essential
step in developing and utilizing IT effectively and efficiently in our
health  care  system.  IT  systems  must  use  common  standards  for
data  transmission,  data  sharing,  medical  terminology,  communica-
tions,  security,  and  other  features.  Developing  these  inter-oper-
ability  standards  will  allow  disparate  IT  systems  and  software  ap-
plications to communicate, exchange data and use that information
to both improve the quality of care provided to our nation’s patients
and to decrease the cost of providing that care.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID E. SILVERSTONE

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, thank you for holding this hearing
on  health  information  technology  and  the  need  for  inter-operability  standards  that
will  promote  and  support  the  integration  of  private  and  secure  health  information
enterprises. I appreciate the opportunity to present the perspective of specialty phy-
sicians  on  your  legislative  proposal,  H.R.  2406,  which  is  pending  before  the  Com-
mittee.

I am David Silverstone. I am a practicing ophthalmologist at The Eye Care Group
in  New  Haven,  Connecticut  where  I  am  also  a  Clinical  Professor  of  Ophthalmology
and  Visual  Science  at  the  Yale  School  of  Medicine  and  the  Assistant  Chief  of  Oph-
thalmology at Yale-New Haven Hospital. I serve as the Chair of the American Soci-
ety of Cataract and Refractive Surgery’s (ASCRS) Subcommittee on Health Informa-
tion  Technology,  as  well  as  the  ASCRS  liaison  to  the  American  Society  of  Oph-
thalmic  Administrator’s  Executive  Board.  Today,  I  am  here  representing  the  Alli-
ance  of  Specialty  Medicine—a  coalition  of  11  medical  societies,  representing  nearly
200,000 specialty physicians.

First,  we  would  like  to  thank  you  for  your  efforts  to  advance  health  information
technology  (HIT)  legislation  and  for  including  specialty  physicians  in  the  develop-
ment process. We believe that your legislation, H.R. 2406, which authorizes the Na-
tional  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  to  enhance  efforts  to  integrate
health  care  information  enterprises  in  the  United  States,  will  help  to  promote  the
wide  spread  adoption  of  effective  HIT.  Health  Information  Technology  has  the  po-
tential  to  increase  efficiency  and  quality  of  care  but  this  cannot  be  achieved  until
we  have  effective  standards  for  communication  and  interaction  among  systems.  In

tion network that is reliable, inter-operable, secure, and protects patient privacy.

Specialty physicians have been and continue to be actively engaged in the quality
improvement arena. Through the development of measure specifications for services
and  the  development  of  a  rational  system  for  collecting,  aggregating,  and  reporting
data  across  numerous  public  and  private  insurance  programs  in  the  least  burden-
some  way,  we  have  played  a  pivotal  role  in  shaping  the  future  of  our  health  care
delivery system. However, in order to continue making progress in this area, we be-
lieve  that  specialty  physicians,  and  indeed  all  health  care  providers,  must  employ
reliable  and  secure  health  information  technology  systems.  These  systems  are  a

these systems will help us to harness medical knowledge to enable health care pro-

We believe that an effective quality improvement program must incorporate the use

programs  for  physicians’  services.  As  you  know,  the  typical  American  small  physi-
cian  practices  and  physicians  not  employed  by  large  institutions  will  continue  to
face  challenges  in  financing  the  purchase  of  integrated  HIT  systems.  In  addition,
many progressive practices that were ‘‘early adopters’’ of HIT are now finding them-
selves with costly systems that are now out-of-date. The cost of updating these sys-
tems will be too great to bear in light of pending health care services reimbursement
reductions  and  the  current  lack  of  inter-operability  standards.  Most  physicians  do
not  have  HIT  systems  and  are  ‘‘watching  and  waiting’’;  they  do  not  feel  confident
making such a large investment in health IT because of the cost and the uncertainty
of future system compatibility.

Therefore,  as  Congress  addresses  this  legislation  or  similar  legislation  in  the  fu-
ture,  we  hope  that  additional  efforts  to  promote  health  IT  and  inter-operability  in-
clude  more  financial  assistance  for  physicians  to  obtain  health  IT.  Efforts  to  ease
the  burden  on  physicians  seeking  to  purchase  health  information  technology,  espe-
cially  in  the  face  of  annual  updates  below  medical  inflation  due  to  the  flawed  sus-
tainable growth rate (SGR) formula, are greatly appreciated but also essential.

Your  bill,  which  would  accelerate  the  development  of  inter-operability  guidelines
and  standards,  is  both  a  necessary  and  essential  step  in  deploying  and  utilizing  IT
effectively  and  efficiently  in  our  health  care  system.  IT  systems  must  use  common
standards  for  data  transmission,  data  sharing,  medical  terminology,  communica-
tions,  security  and  other  features.  Developing  these  inter-operability  standards  will
allow  disparate  IT  systems  and  software  applications  to  communicate,  exchange
data  and  use  that  information  to  both  improve  the  quality  of  care  provided  to  our
nation’s patients and to decrease the cost of providing that care.

We concur that NIST, with its expertise in electronic commerce, information tech-
nology, security and privacy, coupled with the health care component of the Malcolm
Baldrige  National  Quality  Program  and  its  expertise  in  working  with  the  informa-
tion technology and health care industries, is well equipped to address the technical
challenges posed by health care information enterprise integration.

As  you  know,  an  integrated  information  enterprise  is  critical  for  useful  HIT.  In-
volving an entity, such as NIST, with the capacity to promote guidelines and stand-
ards  in  the  public  and  private  sectors  will  encourage  functional  uniformity  among
HIT  products.  Current  problems  resulting  from  the  fragmentation  of  health  care  in
the United States would be greatly diminished and physicians will be able to choose
products  that  conform  to  specific  practice  needs,  while  also  ensuring  adequate  and
appropriate information is available to other providers.

In  addition,  encouraging  inter-operability  between  entities  through  research  and
development grants to institutions of higher education and for profit/non profit cen-
ters that promise to form ‘‘Centers for Health Care Information Enterprise Integra-
tion’’ will establish a precedent of the importance of inter-operability.

It  is  also  essential  to  identify,  early-on,  any  problems  with  HIT  in  order  to  mini-
mize  costs  and  mitigate  risks  prior  to  widespread  adoption.  A  realistic  timeline  for
HIT  adoption  should  allow  ample  time  to  develop,  test,  and  validate  appropriate
HIT  criteria,  standards  and  guidelines.  Physicians,  largely  inexperienced  with  HIT,
will  also  benefit  from  a  timeline  that  allows  sufficient  time  to  acclimate  to  a  new
system.

On  behalf  of  the  Alliance  for  Specialty  Medicine,  thank  you  for  your  leadership
in  advancing  the  quality  of  our  health  care  system  by  addressing  the  needs  of  the
health care industry in the area of HIT. And, thank you again for continuing to in-
clude  specialty  physicians,  those  as  myself  who  will  be  most  affected  by  practice
changes,  in  the  process.  We  applaud  the  leadership  of  Chairman  Gordon  for  an  ex-
tremely  well  thought  out  plan  that  promotes  the  adoption  of  HIT  by  authorizing
NIST  and  others  with  expertise  in  the  area  of  technical  standards  development  to
take  on  this  monumental  task.  The  Alliance  stands  ready  to  work  with  the  Chair-
man  and  this  committee  on  this  legislation  and  the  rapid  implementation  of  inter-
operability standards.

At this time, I would be happy to answer questions from the Committee Members.
Thank you.

STATEMENT  OF  MS.  NOEL  BROWN  WILLIAMS,  PRESIDENT,
SENIOR  VICE  PRESIDENT,  AND  CHIEF  INFORMATION  OFFI-
CER,  HOSPITAL  CORPORATION  OF  AMERICA  INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES, INC.
Ms.  WILLIAMS.  Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  am  Noel  Wil-
liams, Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer for Hos-
pital  Corporation  of  America,  better  known  as  HCA.  Of  our  192
HCA hospitals, 20 are in 11 Congressional districts, represented by
this  committee,  with  over  16,000  employees.  On  behalf  of  the
American  Hospital  Association’s  nearly  5,000  member  hospitals,
health  systems  and  other  health  care  organization  and  our  37,000
individual  members,  I  appreciate  this  opportunity  to  address  the
Committee  on  the  importance  of  inter-operability  and  security  in
health information technology.

The  mission  of  America’s  hospitals  is  caring  for  patients.  Every
day,  the  women  and  men  of  our  hospitals  strive  to  improve  the
safety  and  quality  of  the  care  they  provide.  Research  has  shown
that  certain  kinds  of  IT  such  as  electronic  health  records,  comput-
erized physician order entry, computerized decision-support system
and  bar  coding  for  medication  administration  can  limit  errors  and
improve care as well as lower cost and improve efficiency. Hospitals
have been pioneers in harnessing the power of IT for improvement.
Our challenge now is to extend the use of IT to all hospitals, large
and small, in both urban and rural areas.

Last  year,  the  AHA  conducted  a  survey  to  assess  the  state  of  IT
implementation  in  America’s  hospitals.  Half  of  hospitals  indicated
a moderate or high use of IT, up from 37 percent in 2005. Overall,
IT use was higher at larger, urban, and teaching hospitals, and not
surprisingly, those with positive financial margins. These hospitals

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:49 Feb 22, 2008 Jkt 037983 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL07\092607\37983 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

24

also  reported  rates  of  growth  in  their  use  of  IT  compared  to  their
small and rural counterparts.

Despite  these  impressive  gains,  there  are  still  obstacles  to  the
goal  of  universal  IT  adoption.  Hospitals  continue  to  cite  cost  as  a
major  barrier.  Hospitals  currently  bear  almost  all  of  the  cost  with
no  increase  in  payment  for  the  use  of  these  new  technologies.  And
the benefits of IT such as decreased need to repeat tests, lower re-
admission  rates,  and  shorter  lengths  of  stay  accrue  to  those  who
pay for care by reducing their costs.

A  lack  of  inter-operability  with  current  IT  systems  also  poses  a
significant  challenge  for  hospitals.  In  2006,  79  percent  of  hospitals
listed inter-operability as either a significant or somewhat of a bar-
rier, compared with 77 in 2005.

We  commend  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  introducing  H.R.  2406  and
for your recognition of the critical role health IT plays in improving
health  care  delivery  in  America.  Legislation  can  help  create  a  pol-
icy  environment  in  which  technology  can  be  best  used  to  support
a safer more efficient health care system. We support the bill’s as-
sertion that confidentiality and security must be underlying compo-
nents  of  any  IT  standards  that  may  be  developed  or  adopted  as  a
result.  Hospitals  have  and  will  continue  to  work  diligently  to  en-
sure  the  confidentiality  and  security  of  personal  health  informa-
tion.  We  also  agree  with  the  assessment  of  the  National  Institute
of  Standards  and  Technology.  This  organization  has,  through  its
standards  and  process-development  work  in  many  industries,  es-
tablished itself as a valuable resource to both the private and pub-
lic  sector,  but  there  are  already  many,  perhaps  too  many  duplica-
tive  efforts  launched  by  the  government  in  attempts  to  speed
health  care  IT  adoption.  In  the  past  few  years  alone,  the  govern-
ment  has  created  or  partially  funded  several  overlapping  initia-
tives. These organizations lack coordination. The AHA believes that
what  is  needed  to  speed  the  adoption  of  health  IT  in  America  is  a
common vision for the future of health IT, a roadmap and timeline
for  change,  a  detailed  implementation  plan,  developed  together
with key stakeholders that articulates each stakeholder’s roles and
responsibilities.  We  are  concerned  that  H.R.  2406  could  give  NIST
overlapping  responsibilities  without  addressing  the  key  needs  of  a
national  inter-operative  health  IT  network.  NIST’s  core  com-
petencies are measure science, rigorous tracibility, and the develop-
ment  and  use  of  standards.  While  these  competencies,  combined
with  NIST’s  resources  could  serve  as  a  resource  to  the  public  and
private  sector,  NIST  is  likely  not  the  organization  to  provide  the
transformational  leadership  required  in  health  care.  NIST  could
develop resources for health care providers as it has done for man-
ufacturing to help hospital leaders, while striving to achieve higher
standards of quality, safety and efficiency, who are limited to local
influence.  They,  therefore,  must  look  to  national  leadership  to  cre-
ate  an  environment  that  will  enable  them  to  make  significant  in-
vestments  in  IT.  There  must  be  a  reasonable  expectation  on  the
part of hospitals that they are heading towards the same goal and
using  the  same  measures  of  success  as  every  other  hospital  in  the
country.

Mr.  Chairman,  it  is  the  mission  of  every  hospital  in  every  com-
munity in America to provide the best care possible, and health IT

is a crucial tool to providing safe and effective care to the right pa-
tient,  in  the  right  setting  at  the  right  time.  We  look  forward  to
working  with  this  committee  to  forge  ahead  towards  a  shared  goal
of  improving  the  reach  of  health  IT,  and  as  a  result  our  nation’s
health care community.

STATE  OF  IT  ADOPTION  IN  AMERICA’S  HOSPITALS  AND  HEALTH  SYS-

TEMS

The  mission  of  America’s  hospitals  is  caring  for  patients,  and  every  day  the
women and men of our hospitals strive to improve the safety and quality of the care
they  provide.  Research  has  shown  that  certain  kinds  of  IT—such  as  computerized
physician  order-entry  (CPOE),  computerized  decision  support  systems  and  bar-cod-
ing  for  medication  administration—can  limit  errors  and  improve  care.  IT  also  can
be  a  tool  for  improving  efficiency  and  costs.  Hospitals  have  been  pioneers  in  har-
nessing  IT  to  improve  patient  care,  quality  and  efficiency;  the  challenge  now  is  to
extend its use and integrate it into the routine care processes in all hospitals, large
and small, in both urban and rural areas.

A  2006  AHA  survey  of  hospitals  and  health  systems  sought  to  assess  the  state
of  health  IT  implementation  in  America’s  hospitals.  The  survey  included  questions
about the use of IT applications such as CPOE and electronic health records (EHRs),
perceived barriers to implementation, IT financing and the use of non-clinical IT ap-
plications.

Over  1,500  hospitals  (about  one-third  of  the  field)  responded  to  the  survey.  The
data  again  indicated  that  hospitals  are  making  great  strides  in  embracing  health
IT:  about  half  of  the  respondents  indicated  a  moderate  or  high  use  of  IT,  up  from
37  percent  in  2005.  This  figure  was  determined  by  the  number  of  clinical  IT  func-
tions a hospital had fully implemented, such as medication order-entry, test results
review or clinical alerts.

Over  two-thirds  of  hospitals  reported  either  fully  or  partially  implemented  elec-
tronic health records. Larger, urban and teaching hospitals were more likely to have
fully  implemented  EHR  systems,  and  accounted  for  11  percent  of  the  total.  Use  of
CPOE  is  also  becoming  more  common.  In  2006,  at  10  percent  of  hospitals,  physi-
cians  routinely  ordered  medications  electronically  at  least  half  of  the  time.  For  lab-
oratory  and  other  tests,  orders  were  placed  electronically  at  least  half  of  the  time
in 16 percent of hospitals.

One of the most dramatic changes from year to year was in the use of computer-
ized  alerts  designed  to  prevent  negative  drug  interactions.  In  2006,  51  percent  of
hospitals used real-time drug interactions alerts, up from 23 percent the year before.
As  with  EHR  systems,  general  health  IT  use  was  higher  at  larger,  urban  and
teaching hospitals, as well as those with positive financial margins. These hospitals
also reported greater rates of growth in their use of IT than their smaller and rural
counterparts.

Despite  these  impressive  gains,  there  are  still  obstacles  to  the  goal  of  universal
IT  adoption,  and,  not  surprisingly,  cost  issues  top  the  list.  Ninety-four  percent  of
hospitals  reported  that  the  initial  costs  of  adoption  were  a  significant  or  somewhat
of a barrier to IT adoption, down just one percent from 2005. Smaller hospitals were
more likely to see costs as a barrier, but even the largest hospitals struggle to afford
health  IT.  Accelerating  adoption  across  the  hospital  field  will  require  a  shared  in-
vestment  between  providers,  payers  and  purchasers.  Hospitals  currently  bear  al-
most all the costs of IT investment, with no increase in payment for the use of these
new  technologies.  However,  many  of  the  financial  benefits  of  IT,  such  as  decreased
need  for  repeat  tests,  lower  re-admission  rates,  and  shorter  lengths  of  stay,  accrue
to those who pay for care.

The lack of inter-operability with current IT systems also poses a mounting chal-
lenge  for  hospitals.  In  the  2006,  79  percent  of  hospitals  listed  this  issue  as  either
a significant or somewhat of a barrier, compared with 77 percent in 2005.
PRINCIPLES FOR REALIZING THE PROMISE OF HEALTH IT

As  the  survey  demonstrates,  an  increasing  number  of  hospitals  and  health  sys-
tems are harnessing the power of health IT to improve quality, safety and efficiency.
However, the hospital field is now challenged to extend the use of IT and integrate
it into routine care processes in hospitals big and small, urban and rural. The AHA
strongly supports the growing use of health IT. As Congress and the Administration
consider  ways  to  encourage  increased  adoption  and  greater  information  exchange,
we  will  continue  to  advocate  for  solutions  that  address  major  barriers  to  realizing
the promise of health IT.

The  AHA  believes  the  following  principles  should  guide  efforts  to  extend  IT  use

in health care:
IT  is  an  enabling  tool  for  improving  the  quality  and  safety  of  care.  Tech-
nology adoption is not a goal in and of itself. Investments should be driven by qual-
ity and safety improvements that can be brought about by technology.
A lack of standards is not the problem. Both adoption and information sharing
will  increase  when  health  information  and  IT  applications  are  more  standardized.
For example, to have data at the point of care, laboratory information systems need
to be integrated with pharmacy systems and the patient’s health record. Currently,
hospitals devote considerable staff and financial resources to creating interfaces be-
tween systems or other IT ‘‘workarounds.’’ The problem is we need to select a single
set  of  standards  and  get  consensus  among  health  care  stakeholders  to  use  those
standards.

Greater  standardization  across  information  technologies,  and  improvements  that
make IT systems easier for caregivers to use, would facilitate adoption. Information
exchange requires even greater standardization across care settings, such as a phy-
sician’s office and a hospital’s emergency department.

Standards-setting organizations have already developed many different standards,
and the sheer volume of standards from which to choose is stunning. A survey con-
ducted  by  the  National  Alliance  for  Health  Information  Technology  discovered  over
2,000 standards related to health IT, and over 400 organizations that either create,
maintain or license those standards.

Standards  are  needed  not  just  for  the  useful  exchange  of  data,  but  also  for  a
smarter  application  of  IT  throughout  the  health  care  setting.  For  example,  stand-
ards  can  help  hospitals  prevent  errors  in  medication  ordering  and  administration,
allow  hospitals  to  verify  patients’  medications,  integrate  data  from  IV  pumps  and
other  medical  devices  and  exchange  data  between  CPOE  and  pharmacy  systems.  A
first standard needed in this area is unique identification of medications at the unit
dose level using a standard that is common across all settings.

Hospitals  now  use  many  different  medical  devices  that  produce  digital  health  in-
formation,  including  IV  pumps,  ventilators,  pulse  oximeters,  and  others.  We  could
improve safety if hospitals could connect the pieces of equipment so that, for exam-
ple, data from an IV pump can be shared with a monitor and a ventilator. Another
first standard needed is a communication standard for medical devices.

And we still lack the most basic of all—a standardized way of matching individual

patients to their records.
Information  exchange  should  be  promoted  as  a  public  resource.  Improved
care comes when the right information is available to the right provider at the right
time.  Data  cannot  belong  to  an  organization,  physician  or  vendor.  The  community
and  regional  organizations  that  will  emerge  to  accomplish  this  will  require  govern-
ance  structures  that  both  promote  exchange  and  articulate  the  value  of  doing  so.
Funding.  Health  IT  is  costly.  Most  of  the  initial  cost  is  borne  by  hospitals,  while
the financial benefits often flow downstream to other providers, payers and employ-
ers.  For  this  reason,  the  AHA  believes  that  providers  and  payers  must  share  these
investments.  Moreover,  maintenance  costs  are  significant.  Adoption  of  health  IT  is
more difficult for small and rural hospitals because they likely have a less developed
infrastructure  and  less  staff  support  (both  technical  and  administrative).  Increased
Medicare payments to support the ongoing costs of IT, as well as low-interest loans
and grants to support both hospitals’ initial investments in IT and the development
of health information exchange projects are needed.
Regulatory  relief.  Many  physicians  do  not  have  the  financial  or  technical  re-
sources  needed  to  navigate  the  complex  IT  market.  As  a  result,  despite  the  links
to  improved  quality  of  care,  only  about  20  to  25  percent  of  physicians  use  EHRs.

27

To  facilitate  the  sharing  of  clinical  information  and  improve  patient  care,  hospitals
with  more  advanced  IT  systems  than  the  physicians  practicing  in  their  community
may  want  to  provide  physicians  with  hardware,  software,  connectivity  or  other  as-
sistance that would allow them to maintain EHRs for their patients and share clin-
ical  data  with  the  hospital.  However,  hospitals  cannot  do  so  because  of  physician
self-referral, or ‘‘Stark,’’ regulations. Some regulatory relief has recently been grant-
ed  in  this  area:  The  hospital  field  would  like  to  see  this  made  permanent  in  law.
A  single  set  of  privacy  laws.  The  multiplicity  of  privacy  rules  from  local,  State
and Federal Governments, accrediting bodies and other organizations makes compli-
ance  difficult  and  can  interfere  with  patient  care.  Simply  identifying  all  of  the  rel-
evant  rules  can  be  a  monumental  task,  let  alone  determining  how  to  comply  when
the  laws  may  conflict.  A  single  set  of  privacy  rules  is  needed  to  facilitate  the  use
of IT and ensure access by health care providers to needed information at the point
of care. Specifically, federal privacy laws as laid out in the Health Information Port-
ability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) should preempt State and local privacy laws.
A uniform approach to matching patients to their records. The electronic ex-
change of health information requires a consistent, reliable mechanism for matching
patients to their records. This is best achieved with an individual health information
authentication  number.  Without  a  single  authentication  number,  there  are  serious
safety  risks  that  could  arise  from  attributing  a  medical  record  to  the  wrong  indi-
vidual.  For  individuals  with  common  names,  a  cluster  of  demographic  information
may not be sufficient to distinguish between the 37-year-old Mary Jones with diabe-
tes and a penicillin allergy and the 37-year-old Mary Jones in perfect health. Mixing
up their records could have serious consequences.

VIEWS ON H.R. 2406

We  commend  you  Mr.  Chairman  and  the  other  co-sponsors  of  H.R.  2406  for  your
recognition of the critical role health IT plays in the improvement of the U.S. health
care  delivery  system.  Legislation  is  a  powerful  tool  that  demonstrates  the  commit-
ment  of  leadership  not  only  to  raise  awareness  of  the  issues,  but  to  help  create  a
policy  environment  in  which  technology  can  be  best  used  to  support  a  safer,  more
efficient health care system.

We support the bill’s recognition of confidentiality and security as underlying com-
ponents of any IT standards that may be developed or adopted as a result. Hospitals
have  and  will  continue  to  work  diligently  to  ensure  the  confidentiality  and  security
of personal health information. This too is an essential piece of that larger environ-
ment  that  must  be  in  place  for  IT  implementation  to  succeed.  Commitment  to  this
concept  must  be  evident  along  each  step  of  this  complex  process  in  order  to  engage
the support of the public.

The  AHA  shares  the  bill’s  acknowledgement  of  the  accomplishments  and  reputa-
tion earned by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This or-
ganization has, through its standards and process development work in many indus-
tries, established itself as a valuable resource to both the private and public sectors.
Founded  in  1901,  NIST  is  a  non-regulatory  federal  agency  within  the  U.S.  Depart-
ment  of  Commerce.  NIST’s  mission  is  to  promote  U.S.  innovation  and  industrial
competitiveness  by  advancing  measurement  science,  standards,  and  technology.
Four cooperative programs comprise the NIST mission: NIST Laboratories conducts
research  that  advances  the  Nation’s  technology  infrastructure;  Hollings  Manufac-
turing  Extension  Partnership  offers  technical  and  business  assistance  to  smaller
manufacturers  through  a  nationwide  network  of  local  centers;  NIST’s  Advanced
Technology  Program  co-funds  research  and  development  partnerships  with  the  pri-
vate  sector  to  develop  innovative  technologies  that  can  benefit  the  entire  Nation;
and the Baldrige National Quality Program promotes excellence in several business
sectors, including health care. Through its annual Malcolm Baldrige National Qual-
ity Award, NIST recognizes these quality achievements.

Currently,  there  are  several—perhaps  too  many—efforts  to  lead  the  health  IT

movement in the U.S. In the past few years, the government has:

• Created  through  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (HHS)  the
American  Health  Information  Community  (AHIC),  ‘‘a  federal  advisory  body,
chartered in 2005 to make recommendations to the Secretary of the U.S. De-
partment  of  Health  and  Human  Services  on  how  to  accelerate  the  develop-
ment and adoption of health information technology. AHIC was formed by the
Secretary  to  help  advance  efforts  to  achieve  the  goal  for  most  Americans  to
have  access  to  secure  electronic  health  records  by  2014.’’  Plans  are  currently
in development to convert the AHIC into a public/private entity by 2008.

28

• Created  the  Office  of  the  National  Coordinator  for  Health  Information  Tech-
nology (ONC). According to the ONC, it ‘‘provides counsel to the Secretary of
Health  and  Human  Services  and  departmental  leadership  for  the  develop-
ment and nationwide implementation of an inter-operable health information
technology infrastructure. Use of this infrastructure will improve the quality,
safety  and  efficiency  of  health  care  and  the  ability  of  consumers  to  manage
their  health  information  and  health  care.  ONC  also  provides  management
and logistical support for AHIC.’’
• Initially funded the creation of the Certification Commission for Health Infor-
mation  Technology  (CCHIT).  According  to  CCHIT,  it  is  ‘‘a  recognized  certifi-
cation  body  for  electronic  health  records  and  their  networks,  and  an  inde-
pendent,  voluntary,  private-sector  initiative.  It  is  our  mission  is  to  accelerate
the  adoption  of  health  information  technology  by  creating  an  efficient,  cred-
ible and sustainable certification program.’’
• Initially funded the creation of the Health Information Technology Standards
Panel  (HITSP),  through  the  American  National  Standards  Institute  (ANSI),
‘‘to serve as a cooperative partnership between the public and private sectors
for  the  purpose  of  achieving  a  widely  accepted  and  useful  set  of  standards
specifically  to  enable  and  support  widespread  inter-operability  among  health
care  software  applications,  as  they  will  interact  in  a  local,  regional  and  na-
tional health information network for the United States. Comprised of a wide
range  of  stakeholders,  the  Panel  will  assist  in  the  development  of  the  U.S.
Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN) by addressing issues such as
privacy  and  security  within  a  shared  health  care  information  system.’’  The
NHIN  is  viewed  as  a  ‘‘network  of  networks’’  that  will  allow  the  seamless  ex-
change  of  health  information  anywhere  in  the  U.S.,  and  is  currently  in  the
planning stages. An executive order specifies that any new federal health in-
formation system launched after January 1, 2008 to be compliant with HITSP
recommended  standards.  HHS  Secretary  Michael  Leavitt  has  already  accept-
ed  30  recommendations  for  inter-operability  standards  that  will  be  required
to build a NHIN.

We are concerned that there are already too many overlapping, duplicative efforts
launched by the government to try to speed health care IT adoption. These organiza-
tions lack coordination, a common vision for the future of health IT, a roadmap and
timeline for change, and a detailed implementation plan that articulates each stake-
holder’s roles and responsibilities. We are afraid that H.R. 2406 could position NIST
as  just  another  government  entity  with  overlapping  responsibility  without  address-
ing  the  key  needs  noted  above.  It  is  instead  our  hope  that  NIST  will  function  as
a common resource to the different players and help advance the goals we have ar-
ticulated.

For  example,  the  ‘‘Technical  Activities’’  described  include  standards  and  inter-
operability analysis, software conformance and certification. These areas are already
under  intense  scrutiny  by  several  groups.  Coming  to  agreement  on  the  standards
to be used will require collaboration and a private-public partnership that prioritizes
where  standards  are  needed,  follows  a  consensus-building  process  to  determine
which standards to adopt, and ensures that they can be operationalized. Key stake-
holders,  including  providers,  payers,  standards  organizations,  vendors  and  regu-
lators must be part of the discussion and agree to an implementation process.

In  addition,  NIST’s  core  competencies,  by  its  own  definition,  are:  measurement
science;  rigorous  traceability;  and  the  development  and  use  of  standards.  While
these  competencies,  combined  with  NIST  resources,  could  serve  as  a  resource  to
both  the  public  and  private  sectors,  NIST  is  likely  not  the  organization  to  provide
the transformational leadership required in health care. However, the AHA believes
NIST  may  be  able  to  develop  implementation  tactics  for  health  care  providers,  as
it  has  done  for  manufacturing  and  its  associated  supply  chain  operations.  Toolkits
and  guidance  that  enable  hospital  leaders  to  achieve  Baldridge-level  quality  within
their organizations that also scale nationally are required for success.
CONCLUSION

Hospital leaders, while striving daily to achieve higher standards of quality, safe-
ty and efficiency, are limited to local influence within an organization. When we dis-
cuss  the  merits  of  national  health  care  information  networks,  inter-operability  and
the resulting improvements in safety and efficiency, hospitals must look to national
leadership  to  create  an  environment  that  will  enable  a  hospital  to  make  significant
IT investments. This is especially true if the beneficiaries of those investments exist
outside  of  the  boundaries  of  the  individual  hospital  or  hospital  network.  In  order
for  a  hospital  to  make  an  investment  that  ultimately  benefits  the  greater  good,

there must be a reasonable expectation on the part of that hospital that it is head-
ing  toward  the  same  goal  and  using  the  same  measures  of  success  as  every  other
hospital in the country.

Mr. Chairman, it is the mission of every hospital in every community in America
to provide the best care possible to people in need. Inter-operable health information
technology  is  a  crucial  tool  in  providing  safe  and  effective  care  to  the  right  patient,
in  the  right  setting,  at  the  right  time.  We  look  forward  to  working  with  this  com-
mittee and staff to forge ahead toward to a shared goal of improving the inter-oper-
ability and deployment of health IT and, as a result, our nation’s health care deliv-
ery system. Again, I thank you for the opportunity to testify before this committee.

STATEMENT OF MS. LINDA L. KLOSS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFI-
CER,  AMERICAN  HEALTH  INFORMATION  MANAGEMENT  AS-
SOCIATION, CHICAGO, IL
Ms.  KLOSS.  Chairman  Gordon,  Mr.  Hall,  and  Members  of  the
Committee,  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  testify  on  health  in-
formation  standards  and  inter-operability.  I  am  Linda  Kloss,  and
I represent the American Health Information Management Associa-
tion  as  its  chief  executive  officer.  This  topic  is  of  great  importance
to  my  colleagues  in  health  information  management  and  our  over
50,000 members of the association.

Today  our  professionals  are  on  the  front  lines,  sort  of  in  the
trenches  if  you  will,  in  implementing  electronic  health  records  and
other  health  information  technologies.  This  includes  health  infor-
mation  exchange  among  providers,  new  ways  for  consumers  to  ac-
cess  their  own  health  information.  Confidentiality,  privacy,  secu-
rity,  data  integrity,  and  consumer  access  are  core  value  we  bring
to this important work.

Before I begin, I want to thank you for your support and passage
of  H.R.  1467,  the  Ten  Thousand  Trained  by  2010  Act.  The  Bureau
of  Labor  Statistics,  our  own  research  and  that  of  others,  substan-
tiates  the  needs  for  more  experienced  health  IT  information  man-
agement  and  workforce  to  achieve  inter-operability,  and  we  cer-
tainly  urge  the  Senate  to  follow  your  leadership  in  addressing  the
important heath IT workforce issue.

Our  prepared  comments  addressed  all  of  the  questions  that  the
Committee put forward, but I want to just concentrate my oral tes-
timony  today  on  a  few  subjects  relating  to  integrating  the  health
care information enterprise.

They are: first, the need for uniform and coordinated data stand-
ards  necessary  for  inter-operability,  in  other  words,  some  focus  on
what  types  of  standards  we  are  talking  about;  and  secondly,  the
need  for  a  stable  long-term  strategy  for  standards  harmonization
that goes to the point Ms. Williams made.

Over  the  past  four  years,  there  really  have  been  quite  remark-
able accomplishments in advancing standards for functionality and
data  interchange  for  the  EHR  and  Health  Information  Exchange.
However,  the  discussion  on  data  content  standards,  what  Dr.
Silverstone referred to as the medical terminology, the focus of that
to date, critical information that makes up the EHR and is actually
what is transmitted has received too little attention.

I  compare  these  distinctions  of  building  reservoirs  and  pipelines
but not addressing the quality of the water that is flowing through
those pipelines. So I urge that as we are thinking of standards, we
expand  our  thinking  to  take  in  the  standards  relating  to  clinical
terms and contents that are used to describe medical and care serv-
ices,  the  critical  language  of  medicine.  These  terms  and  contents
making up the language of medicine are embodied in terminologies
and  classification  systems  that  are  used  to  catalog  them  so  that
they  can  be  stored,  exchanged,  retrieved,  analyzed,  and  inter-oper-
ability  really  requires  the  sender  and  the  receiver  to  understand
the exchange and interpret that information correctly. Terminology
in  classifications  systems  is  critical  for  not  only  information  ex-
change  for  patient-care  purposes,  but  for  public  health,  quality  re-
porting  and  other  purposes.  But  today,  we  have  over  100  termi-
nology  and  classification  systems,  and  the  U.S.  has  not  put  in
place,  as  other  nations  have,  a  way  to  ensure  a  proper  foundation
for  these  systems  as  critical  standards  for  inter-operability.  Along
with  our  colleagues  from  the  American  Medical  Informatics  Asso-
ciation, AHIMA has looked into this issue, and we convened an ex-
pert  taskforce  and  prepared  a  set  of  recommendations  under  a
white paper called Healthcare Terminologies and Classification and
Action  Agenda  for  the  United  States,  and  we  provided  an  extract
from that white paper attached to our testimony. It calls for a for-
mation  of  a  public-private  authority  or  an  entity  to  be  established
to  ensure  that  we  have  robust  and  up-to-date  terminologies  and
classification  standards  and  authoritative  ways  of  keeping  track  of
them,  and  we  also  call,  in  that  report,  for  further  research,  plan-
ning research, as to how we are going to do this well in the United
States. So as part of the bill before us today, we are pleased to see
a  focus  on  research,  and  we  think  one  of  the  critical  areas  for  re-
search, in fact, is how we are going to stand and have the authority
and  a  process  for  terminologies  and  classifications  that  will  really
make health care information inter-operable.

As a second area of focus today, we would just speak to—it does

ring.

Chairman  GORDON.  That  is  not  you.  We  are,  I  guess,  going  into

session, so please go forward.

Ms. KLOSS. Our second area for comment is regarding standards
harmonization.  We  do  believe  important  progress  has  been  made
towards  adoption  and  use  of  EHRs,  and  we  acknowledge  the  work
of  the  Office  of  the  National  Coordinator,  the  American  Health  In-
formation  Community,  the  Health  Information  Technology  Stand-

ards  Panel,  and  the  Certification  Commission  for  Health  Informa-
tion Technology. All of these efforts have really been organized and
set in place over the last four years, and they have provided a sig-
nificant boost towards inter-operability.

We  do  believe  there  is  an  important  role  for  NIST  in  bringing
both  standards  development  and  resources  to  this.  NIST  has  done
a  lot  to  harmonize  standards  and  to  bring  adoption  guidelines  for-
ward, but this is largely a voluntary effort, and it is suffering from
the woes of many hundreds of people working through, essentially,
a voluntary effort that is contract funded, whereas what we do be-
lieve  is  going  to  be  needed  is  a  long-term  strategy  for  standards
harmonization. We do believe that NIST, well known for its exper-
tise  in  information  security  and  other  standards,  can  supply  the
health  information  standards  harmonization  object  with  ready
standards  that  can  be  applied  and  harmonized  and  test  labora-
tories contributing to the Certification Commission.

Chairman  GORDON.  Ms.  Kloss,  we  have  just  been  called  for  a
vote.  We  have  five  minutes.  So  if  you  would  like  to  quickly  con-
clude,  then  I  think  we  will  have  time  to  hear  from  the  other  two
witnesses.

Ms.  KLOSS.  I  actually  can  conclude  here.  I  would  just  say  that
we  are  ready  to  work  with  you  and  the  Committee  to  mobilize  all
available resources to help with this important effort.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Kloss follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF LINDA L. KLOSS

Chairman  Gordon,  Mr.  Hall,  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  good  morning  and
thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  testify  on  the  issues  relating  to  Meeting  the  Need
for Inter-operability and Information Security in Health IT. This topic is of great im-
portance to my colleagues in health care information management and has been for
many years.

I am Linda Kloss and I represent the American Health Information Management
Association (AHIMA) as its Chief Executive Officer. AHIMA is an association of over
51,000  health  information  management  (HIM)  professionals  deeply  committed  to
and  actively  participating  in  the  adoption  of  standards-based  and  inter-operable
health IT. Since 1928, HIM professionals have worked to improve the accuracy, com-
pleteness, confidentiality and security of medical record information to support clin-
ical care and improve health care of all Americans.

Today, HIM professionals are on the front lines in implementing electronic health
records and other technologies to improve health care. This includes information ex-
change among providers and new ways for consumers to access their own health in-
formation. Confidentiality, privacy, security, data integrity, and consumer access are
core values we bring to this important work.

As I speak this morning, I must inform you that AHIMA, through its Foundation
for  Research  and  Education  (FORE)  has  been  a  contractor  for  several  health  infor-
mation  improvement  projects  initiated  by  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human
Services’  (HHS)  Office  of  the  National  Coordinator  for  Health  Information  Tech-
nology  (ONC),  the  Agency  for  Healthcare  Research  and  Quality  (AHRQ),  and  the
National  Institute  of  Health’s  (NIH)  National  Library  of  Medicine  (NLM).  These
projects  have  included  evaluating  the  mapping  of  classification  systems,  studies  of
the  potential  for  improved  fraud  deterrence  through  the  use  of  electronic  health
record technology (EHR), analyses of privacy and security roadblocks to implementa-
tion  of  EHRs  and  health  information  exchange,  and  development  of  best  practices
for  State  level  health  information  exchange.  The  FORE  foundation,  in  conjunction
with  the  Medical  Group  Management  Association  (MGMA)  also  addressed  aspects
of  the  collection  and  reporting  of  performance  measurement  data.  AHIMA  is  also
one of three organizations that founded the Certification Commission for Health In-
formation Technology (CCHIT) which later received a three-year contract from ONC
and  is  now  an  independent  not-for-profit  organization  recognized  by  the  Secretary
of HHS as a certifying organization for HIT.

AHIMA  is  active  in  a  number  of  standards  activities.  Currently  AHIMA  is  a  vot-
ing  member  of  the  Health  Information  Technology  Standards  Panel  (HITSP)  and
representatives are active on its Security Technical Committee. AHIMA and several
of its members have been active for a number of years in the Health Level 7 (HL7)
standards  development  organization  (SDO).  Currently  our  involvement  is  in  devel-
oping  EHR  system  and  personal  health  record  (PHR)  system  functional  models,
legal EHR functionality, and the clinical document architecture CDA.

AHIMA  is  also  an  active  participant  in  a  number  of  national  and  international
terminology and classification standards organizations. We serve as a member of the
ICD–9–CM  Coordination  and  Maintenance  Committee  with  the  American  Hospital
Association (AHA), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the
Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention’s  (CDC),  National  Center  for  Health
Statistics (NCHS). We also serve as a member of the Cooperating Parties, the group
that sets the guidance for use of ICD–9–CM in the U.S., the editorial advisory pan-
els for the American Medical Association’s Common Procedure Terminology (CPT®),
and  the  Healthcare  Common  Procedure  Coding  System  (HCPCS)  which  is  operated
by  CMS.  Internationally  we  have  been  appointed  by  the  NCHS  to  serve  with  the
World  Health  Organization’s  (WHO)  education,  and  ICD–10  and  ICD–11  reference
terminology  work  groups.  We  also  have  worked  with  the  International  Healthcare
Terminology  Standards  Development  Organization  (IHTSDO),  which  is  the  stand-
ards group that has taken up the SNOMED® terminology system.
Costs and Benefits

Standards-based electronic health record technology is the essential building block
for  much  of  what  we  seek  to  achieve  in  inter-operability.  After  years  of  slow  and
inconsistent progress, I believe that considerable progress is now being made to de-
fine core functionality and data exchange standards and to drive their adoption. The
greater  focus  on  standards  over  the  past  five  years  has  led  to  progress  by  SDOs,
formation  of  the  Health  Information  Technology  Standards  Panel  and  the  Certifi-
cation  Commission  for  Health  IT  and  other  collaborative  projects  which  have  in  ef-
fect  broken  the  log  jam.  However,  the  recent  momentum  must  be  supported  so
progress  can  continue  and  even  accelerate.  With  the  continual  evolution  of  tech-
nology  and  growing  experience  of  those  who  are  using  it,  this  work  will  require  ef-
fective  leadership,  incentives  for  adoption,  and  financial  support  for  the  effort  for
some years to come.

With  a  solid  road  map  and  full  support,  the  benefits  of  inter-operability  include

the ability to:

• Exchange  crucial  health  information  between  health  care  providers  so  that
medical  treatment  for  any  individual  can  be  rendered  accurately  and  com-
pletely.

• Access,  transfer  and  use  the  extraordinary  body  of  knowledge  about  medical
care and personal health and to grow that body of knowledge through acceler-
ated research and dissemination of learning.

• Report and transfer crucial public health data in seconds to improve effective
local  and  national  response  to  individual  and  population  events  and  be  effec-
tive participants in improving global health.

• Achieve  a  high  performing  health  system  in  terms  of  outcomes,  safety  and

cost through performance improvement and public reporting.

• Engage people as full participants in improving their health and wellness.
• Understand  effective  ways  to  transform  care  delivery,  including  how  we  pay

for it.

There  are  numerous  forecasts  and  models  about  the  costs  of  implementing  EHRs
and health information exchange by researchers at RAND, The Center for Informa-
tion  Technology  Leadership,  the  Robert  Wood  Johnson  Foundation,  and  the  Com-
monwealth  Fund  to  name  a  few,  as  well  as  studies  by  AHRQ  and  ONC.  While  the
specific estimates may vary some depending on the sets of assumptions used in the
forecasts, the conclusion is clear: The benefits will outweigh the cost of investing in
secure  and  inter-operable  health  IT.  But  it  will  not  be  inexpensive  and  the  return
on  investment  will  not  be  quick.  Any  consideration  of  cost  must  take  into  account
the costs of the current state of health care. For example,

• What is the cost of treating patients with limited and inaccessible information

about their medical condition and history?

• What is the cost of our inability to manage an individual’s care across a mul-

tiple number of providers just in trying to get the information needed?

33

• What  is  the  cost  increased  administrative  duties  and  operations  due  to  our
inability to exchange uniform data electronically for secondary purposes such
as research, claims processing and a variety of other administrative activities
that are now restricted by our paper-based information system, restrained by
our  ability  to  review  and  analyze  paper  data,  and  our  ability  to  locate  and
exchange information when and where it is needed?

• What  is  the  cost  of  having  our  limited  data  due  to  the  inappropriate  use  or

limits placed on our terminology and classification standards and systems?

• What is the cost in loss of life and poor health, because the right data is not

available at the right time?

Real  improvements  are  being  documented  by  medical  practices  and  hospital  that
are  using  health  information  technology.  Except  for  delivery  systems  such  as  the
Veteran’s Health Administration, other integrated systems and networks such as e-
prescribing,  improvement  are  for  the  most  part  isolated.  Without  consistent  stand-
ards it is difficult to accrue the values that require inter-operability.
Standards, Guidelines, and Coordination.

I  will  address  three  inter-operability  and  security  issues  in  my  comments  today
that  we  believe  are  important  for  the  Committee  to  take  into  account  in  its  work.
These  are:  terminologies  and  classifications,  data  stewardship,  and  the  harmoni-
zation of standards.
Terminologies and Classifications

The  U.S.  needs  greater  uniformity  and  coordination  of  health  care  terminologies
and classifications, a type of health information standard that is perhaps not as well
understood as are other types of standards. Clinical terms and concepts are the lan-
guage  of  medicine  and  form  the  information  content  in  electronic  health  records.
Terminologies and classifications catalogue these terms and concepts so they can be
stored, exchanged, retrieved and analyzed. Inter-operability requires that the sender
and  receiver  understand  the  exchange  and  interpret  it  correctly.  Terminology  and
classification systems are critical for information exchange, for public health report-
ing, performance measurement, quality reporting, research, and billing and payment
for health care services.

AHIMA  and  the  American  Medical  Informatics  Association  recently  published  a
white  paper  entitled  Healthcare  Terminologies  and  Classifications:  An  Action  Agen-
da  for  the  United  States.  I  have  attached  a  short  summary  of  that  paper  and  its
recommendations,  Healthcare  Terminologies  and  Classifications:  Essential  Keys  to
Inter-operability  to  my  testimony.  This  report  was  prepared  by  a  joint  task  force  of
experts  who  call  for  the  establishment  of  a  public-private  authority  responsible  for
ensuring the U.S. has:

• Robust  and  up-to-date  terminologies  and  classifications  for  inter-operability

between systems;

• Standards  for  developing  terminologies  and  classifications  in  the  EHR  and

PHR, including implementation guides;

• Principles  and  guideline  for  development,  distribution,  and  maintenance  of

systems and coordination across systems;

• Timely and reliable industry guidance;
• A coherent set of policies and procedures to ensure openness and performance
for  terminologies,  classifications,  and  the  systems  that  convert  data  encoded
in one terminology or classification to another; and,

• Business  process  automation  to  ensure  cost-effective  development  of  systems

and cost-effective use by providers, payers, and other organizations.

While federal and private entities have made genuine progress, the task force rec-
ommends public funding for a research and development project to design a perma-
nent governance mechanism and formulate strategies and plans for:

• Contemporary  and  standardized  processes  for  development,  adoption,  and

maintenance of terminologies and classifications;

• The  structure,  function,  and  operating  practices  for  a  U.S.  public/private  au-

thority to oversee terminologies and classifications;

• Gaining  commitment  of  terminology  and  classification  stakeholders—devel-
opers,  end  users,  and  other  service  and  technology  suppliers—to  principles
and guidelines for open and transparent approaches that permit cost-effective
inter-operability of complete and accurate information; and

• U.S.  participation  in  the  IHTSDO—the  international  organization  now  ad-
dressing  SNOMED  terminology  which  we  believe  is  the  base  terminology  for
a standard EHR.

AHIMA and AMIA are prepared to coordinate such an effort, and I ask your con-
sideration  to  support  this  effort.  Without  standard  and  consistent  data  content—
which comes from terminologies and classifications—the U.S. will not achieve inter-
operability of usable information. As described in the task force report, the U.S. has
fallen  behind  other  countries  in  developing;  deploying  and  using  these  critical  and
new approaches to coordination are urgently needed.

Data Stewardship

A second and similar effort is needed in the area of quality measurement and sec-
ondary  data.  Recently,  AHRQ  issued  a  request  for  information  related  to  the  data
measures, data sets, or standards used for the collection of quality measurement in-
formation—the  potential  to  have  a  data  steward  to  coordinate  the  groups  and  the
group processes for developing data collection. This concept was expanded to include
data also collected for a variety of secondary purposes, research, public health, reim-
bursement, and other public policy requirements.

As I noted earlier, the ability to use secondary data from a large population offers
vast  opportunities  to  improve  the  health  of  this  nation  and  reduce  error  and  costs.
At the same time secondary data also supports reimbursement for health care serv-
ices  not  only  in  the  traditional  sense  of  the  billing  claim,  but  also  in  the  form  of
information to support effective payment policy.

As with terminologies and classifications, the U.S. lacks a coordinating body with
requisite  authority  to  set  a  vision  and  operating  policies  for  secondary  use  of  data,
a  data  stewardship  entity.  An  acknowledged  data  steward  entity  would  coordinate
the  various  public/private  groups  working  on  quality  measurement  and  the  em-
ployer/purchaser,  research  and  public  health  communities  which  use  these  data.
AHIMA’s  members  oversee  the  collection  of  these  data  in  many  health  care  organi-
zations.  They  report  that  lack  of  uniformity  in  the  data  sets  requested  and  uni-
formity  of  definitions  results  in  costly  manual  work  and  concerns  about  the  quality
and  validity  of  data  used  to  measure  quality.  Standardizing  measures  and  policies
regarding secondary uses of health information will enable the IT industry to design
solutions  capture  data  once  and  use  it  for  multiple  legitimate  and  authorized  pur-
poses.

Standards Harmonization

The third area relates to the harmonization of technical standards and consistent
guidelines for their use, including standards for clinical terminologies and classifica-
tions, as described earlier.

In  the  1980s  HL7  was  formed  to  address  health  care  institutions’  inability  to
share  data  between  or  among  their  own  data  systems  and  programs.  Today,  HL7
and  other  SDOs  have  become  and  are  addressing  international  information  ex-
change.

Throughout the U.S., industries are sharing data and cutting their administrative
costs  because  they  are  using  uniform  standards,  such  as  the  Accredited  Standards
Organization  X12  standards.  Besides  using  standards,  however,  these  industries
also  use  and  require  guideline  standards—how  the  particular  industry’s  members
will  use  a  chosen  standard,  under  what  conditions  it  will  be  used,  and  what  data
sets will be used, and so forth.

This  has  not  been  the  case  in  the  past  in  health  care.  For  instance  today  we  use
standards  required  by  HIPAA.  We,  therefore,  adopted  an  X12  standard  for  claims,
the  X12–837.  Unfortunately  as  testimony  last  year  at  the  National  Committee  for
Vital  and  Health  Statistics  (NCVHS)  indicated  there  are  now  over  1,000  different
instructions  for  the  use  of  the  X12–837  in  the  health  care  industry.  If  we  are  to
achieve inter-operability and use standard like other industries, this should not hap-
pen or be allowed to happen.

The  health  care  industry  has  over  one  million  providers,  thousands  of  health
plans  and  payers,  a  potential  consumer  base  of  over  300  million  individuals,  and
some 1.44 million employers offering some level of health care, along with numerous
government agencies, clearinghouses, and vendors. Achieving consensus on complex
standards and an understanding of their uniform application is a monumental task
even with a shared vision. In the U.S., our standards data organizations are essen-
tially  groups  of  volunteers  that  come  from  industry  and  the  professions.  It  is  dif-
ficult  to  get  and  keep  volunteers  who  work  for  provider  organizations  working  on
standards, yet their participation is critical.

35

To  address  the  consistent  use  of  a  standard,  the  harmonization  of  standards—to
make the standards work with each other, and to choose the collection of standards
necessary  to  perform  a  function  or  functions  requires  a  significant  effort.  Over  the
last three years we have seen, through the efforts of HHS, ONC, and the American
Health  Information  Community  (AHIC),  the  establishment  of  the  Health  Informa-
tion Technology Standards Panel (HITSP). HITSP and its numerous volunteers have
addressed  the  need  for  standards  for  a  variety  of  health  care  functions  and  per-
formed  the  harmonization  task.  While  the  question  of  adherence  to  this  harmoni-
zation  still  remains  to  be  seen,  the  task  is  the  first  time  (outside  of  some  limited
and similar work done by the NCVHS with e-prescribing and the HIPAA standards)
such an effort has occurred in health care.

AHIMA has three concerns with HITSP in its current capacity. First, it is largely
a  volunteer  effort  and  while  this  improves  acceptance,  it  is  a  slow  process.  H.R.
2406,  introduced  in  this  committee,  has  the  potential  to  provide  some  of  the  re-
sources, through the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), needed
to sustain and accelerate the role that HITSP plays. This does not negate the need
for  an  industry  (public-private)  oversight  group  with  a  role  to  approve,  reject,  or
amend  the  final  choices  for  harmonization  of  standards.  Public/private  involvement
is crucial for acceptance, buy-in and use.

Similarly, NIST could also provide some of the tools for groups like CCHIT, whose
role  is  to  identify  and  test  that  the  standards  harmonized  by  HITSP  and  other
groups,  and  ensuring  those  standards  are  contained  and  functioning  within  the
products  sold  on  the  market.  This  assures  buyers  that  the  products  they  are  pur-
chasing  technology  that  will  allow  them  to  be  inter-operable  with  the  industry  and
the networks under development.

Our  second  concern  related  to  the  need  for  coordination  among  HITSP,  CCHIT,
and  the  entities  charged  with  coordinating  terminologies  and  classifications,  data
stewardship,  health  information  exchange  and  other  related  functions  critical  to
achieve an secure, inter-operable system. Such an entity and role is currently under
discussion  throughout  the  industry,  and  I  will  not  comment  further  at  this  time
since that is not the nature of today’s hearing.

Our third concern with HITSP is funding. How does the Nation fund such a body
that does not itself develop standards, but rather proves the harmonization process?
In other industries there are councils, but no such body exists in health care. If the
benefits from harmonization and eventual inter-operability accrue to the population,
should  the  population,  as  a  whole,  pick  up  this  cost?  That  is  a  discussion  Congress
should  undertake.  Should  H.R.  2406  become  law  and  the  NIST  involvement  occur,
the investment in NIST will assume some of the costs incurred in the harmonization
process, but not all.
Barriers to Inter-operability

I was asked to address barriers to inter-operability and I have already mentioned
several. Let me recap: Industry consensus guidelines for the prioritization, adoption
and use of standards,

• Financial  support  and  staffing  for  the  coordination  and  harmonization  of

standards and the development of guidelines,

• A mechanism for uniform adoption and implementation of standards, and
• The current reimbursement system for health care.

To  date,  the  U.S.  health  care  system  has  only  limited  success  with  the  adoption
and  use  of  standards.  The  standards  chosen  to  be  included  under  HIPAA  were  re-
viewed by the NCVHS and the guidelines were written by the ASC X12. SDOs nor-
mally do not write the guidelines for their standards, but there was no other group
to do so. The NCVHS, while holding considerable public comment would not, today,
be considered a public/private entity that engages the industry and government. The
result,  as  I  have  noted,  is  a  limited  adoption  of  several  of  the  HIPAA  standards,
and an inconsistent use of the more common claims standard and remittance stand-
ard.

More  recently  we  have  seen  the  HITSP  work  diligently  to  harmonize  standards
and recommend guidelines, but we have not had an opportunity to see if the indus-
try will actually be able to adopt and consistently use the standards HITSP has pro-
posed. Without consistent adoption and use we cannot achieve uniformity. This does
not  have  to  mean  that  all  products  have  to  look  the  same,  but  the  data  being  ex-
changed, and the mechanisms for transmitting and receiving it have to be standard
so  no  one  can  question  the  integrity  of  the  data  or  finds  themselves  is  a  position
of not being able to send or receive the data.

36

The  HITSP  entity  and  process  provide  great  promise.  For  the  first  time  we  have
a  body  that  can  be  seen  as  providing  public/private  involvement  in  the  harmoni-
zation and guideline processes, but HITSP has its barriers as well.

I  have  suggested  the  need  for  financial  support  and  staffing  for  coordination  and
harmonization. Without this staffing and the financial support needed to provide the
staffing, the move to identify, adopt, guide, and see consistent standards being used
will lag. Other nations, and industries have addressed this issue and the U.S. must
address  it  as  well.  Perhaps  a  small  fee  can  be  associated  with  each  claim  or  some
other  mechanism  that  will  allow  the  industry  and  its  consumers  to  spread  the  cost
of the work that needs to be done. First, we need funding to establish the processes
and  standards,  and  then  later  maintain  the  system  to  keep  it  refreshed  and  con-
sistent with medical practice and knowledge. Similar funding needs to be examined
for  the  groups  we  suggest  for  terminologies  and  classifications  and  data  steward-
ship. While we must maintain industry oversight through some inclusive public/pri-
vate  entity  or  entities,  we  must  also  move  from  a  volunteer  to  a  full-time  mecha-
nism  to  keep  the  process  progressing.  The  benefits  of  the  standard  EHR  and  sys-
tems we are discussing are too valuable to wait on a disjointed volunteer effort.

If  we  have  the  funding  and  the  standards  and  guides,  how  do  we  compel  there
use?  This  is  a  question  I  hear  very  often.  Standards  have  been  around  for  many
years,  yet  the  health  care  industry  or  market  has  not  been  able  to  sit  down  and
achieve universal compliance seen in other industries and countries. HIPAA was an
attempt,  but  it  did  not  have  industry  involvement  and  buy-in  at  the  level  needed
and  there  is  no  industry  pressure  to  make  covered  entities  abide  by  the  few  rules
it has, including the Federal Government.

If  we  cannot  develop  some  entity  or  mechanism  that  has  the  power  to  not  only
oversee  the  choice  standards  and  guidelines  we  have  been  discussing,  then  we  will
see  a  very  slow  achievement  of  the  steps  necessary  for  full  inter-operability.  This
is a somber statement, and I want to acknowledge the work of the Secretary, ONC,
and  AHIC  who  are  trying  an  approach  based  on  the  Medicare  market  and  the  as-
sumption  that  the  Federal  Government  will  adopt  and  abide  by  the  selected  stand-
ards and guidelines. Essentially, this is an industry-wide voluntary system that sug-
gests  that  others  will  be  as  compliant  as  the  Federal  Government  says  it  will  be.
We  have  not  seen  the  results  of  this  effort  yet  and  much  has  to  be  done.  If  we  do
not have the actual up-front buy-in and then demonstrated compliance from all par-
ties,  including  the  federal  agencies,  even  at  maximum  capacity  it  will  take  many
more  years  before  we  get  to  the  exchange  of  information  we  are  all  seeking  under
the current system,. Today, it is not clear who will lead this charge.

The last barrier related to standards I want to mention is reimbursement. Unfor-

tunately, reimbursement runs the show.

Many  physicians  indicate  they  will  not  even  consider  adoption  of  HIT  and  stand-
ards  until  the  Medicare  and  Medicaid  reimbursement  formulas  are  corrected  and
they  are  paid  adequately.  I  understand  Congress  is  addressing  this  concern,  but
with the Federal Government paying such a big portion of the health care bill, reim-
bursement, especially physician reimbursement is a barrier to adoption.

It  is  more  than  the  amount  of  reimbursement.  The  reimbursement  process  con-
trols other aspects of standards use that affect the achievement of inter-operability.
The  U.S.  use  of  classification  systems  that  reflect  21st  century  medicine  have  been
thwarted continually because many health plans and payers do not want to convert
to a contemporary system. In the U.S., our ICD–9–CM classification system is seen
as  part  of  the  reimbursement  system.  Quality  measurements  are  similarly  fast  be-
coming  viewed  this  way  as  well—administrative  data,  rather  than  information
something that can be accurately used to actually describe our care, diagnoses, and
treatment.

As  we  build  processes  like  quality  measurements  and  data  repositories  like  the
personal  health  record,  the  reliance  on  health  care  claims  data  raises  questions  re-
garding  the  completeness  and  accuracy  of  the  information  for  clinical  use  or  anal-
ysis. We must keep our clinical data free from manipulation for reimbursement pur-
poses, and require our reimbursement processes to find another way to develop their
payment  mechanisms  rather  than  to  appropriately  control  or  impact  our  collection
of  clinical  data.  If  we  cannot  rely  on  the  integrity  of  clinical  data  any  inter-oper-
ability benefit will be greatly diminished.

As  we  build  the  system  to  adopt  and  harmonize  standards  and  design  guidelines
and implementation, we have to build it as intended to provide data that accurately
describes  the  patient  and  medical  encounter.  Yes,  payers  or  health  plans  need  to
be involved in these processes, but lets build our EHRs and information systems to
maximize our health information and ensure data integrity.

Security and Privacy

37

HIM  professionals  have  been  deeply  involved  in  the  need  for  confidentiality  and
security,  and  committed  to  implementing  and  enforcing  laws,  regulations,  and  best
practices  to  assure  maximum  data  and  individual  protections.  We  see  our  role  as
to  provide  maximum  protection  for  the  consumer  and  the  information.  HIM  profes-
sionals  are  often  the  privacy  officer  in  health  care  institutions,  and  are  usually  in-
volved in the process of releasing an individual’s health information for its intended
use.  I  have  attached  to  my  testimony  a  recent  statement  on  the  issue  of  confiden-
tiality that we produced jointly with AMIA.

AHIMA  and  its  members  have  been  involved  in  the  recent  process  of  reviewing
laws, regulations, and practices associated with confidentiality, privacy, and security
across the states and the Federal Government. Many of these laws and regulations
go back decades and are intertwined with purposes now forgotten. It will take time
to  unravel  these  relationships  and  allow  the  states  and  the  Federal  Government  to
develop  uniform  laws  that  protect  health  information.  I  can  assure  the  Committee
that  we  are  engaged  in  and  see  a  tremendous  amount  of  effort  directed  as  devel-
oping  maximum  uniform  protection  and  developing  the  security  mechanisms  nec-
essary to secure our data and networks.

HIM professionals believe that use of standard electric health records will permit
more  secure  protections  for  personal  health  information  than  what  exists  for  the
current paper record. We are in a transition period, moving from a paper-based sys-
tem  to  an  electronic  record.  This  change  is  not  without  confusion  and  gaps  that
must  be  addressed  are  being  addressed.  I  want  to  note  our  support  for  H.R.  2406’s
approach to having NIST assist in the identification of potential security standards
that  should  be  considered  under  the  HITSP  process.  NIST  has  a  demonstrated  ex-
pertise in this arena that can benefit and accelerate the industry’s efforts consider-
ably.

With  the  adoption  of  electronic  health  records  we  have  the  technology  to  provide
confidentiality or privacy through a variety of security processes. Just how we adopt
and  use  security  processes  or  standards  is  under  considerable  and  appropriate  de-
bate.  Identified  health  information  flows  throughout  the  health  care  industry,  and
other industries, as well as to consumers themselves, and in some cases employers.
This flow is through consumer request, reimbursement systems, government report-
ing requirements, school requirements, and so on. The process is complex and some
of the uses of technology just as complex. Therefore, we must be careful to use tech-
nology  wisely  or  we  could  impede  the  movement  of  information  when  it  is  most
needed.

Surveys  indicate  that  most  individuals  want  their  health  information  where  it  is
most  needed  for  their  own  clinical  care  and  for  the  benefit  of  the  population.  What
consumers  do  not  want  is  to  have  their  health  information  misused.  They  do  not
want  to  be  inappropriately  discriminated  against  because  of  their  health  status  or
information.

In  addition  to  uniform  rules,  regulations  and  technology  to  achieve  health  infor-
mation confidentiality and security, AHIMA believes in essentially three basic prin-
ciples for over all protection:

1. Personal health information should be protected wherever it lays or is trans-
ported—whether  or  not  the  entity  or  person  accessing,  transferring,  storing,
or holding the information is a health care entity or covered by HIPAA.

2. Individuals  should  be  protected  against  inappropriate  discrimination  on  the
basis  of  their  health  information—this  would  include  situations  of  employ-
ment and insurance.

3. Individuals  should  be  protected  against  the  intentional  misuse  of  their

health information.

There  are  two  caveats  to  these  three  principles.  To  be  effective  laws  and  regula-
tions  related  to  discrimination  and  misuse  must  include  provisions  for  active  pros-
ecution and penalties, and the public must see active prosecution and penalties.

There  are  and  probably  never  will  be  absolute  secure  systems  that  will  provide
the  confidentiality  or  privacy  sought  by  some  of  the  public  and  expected  by  all  of
the public. But inter-operability will be a failure if we cannot build trust in the sys-
tem  of  EHRs,  PHRs,  and  health  information  exchange.  We  can  never  undue  an  ac-
tual  disclosure  of  an  individual’s  health  information,  but  we  can  take  steps  to  en-
sure  that  any  one  intentionally  discriminating  against  an  individual  or  misusing
health information will know that they face severe penalties for doing so.

Global Harmonization

38

My comments on terminologies and classifications gave a glimpse of international
collaboration.  Many  of  the  classifications  used  in  the  U.S.  are  actually  either  inter-
national  standards,  or  a  U.S.  version  of  an  international  standard.  The  SNOMED
terminology,  for  instance  has  recently  moved  from  a  U.S.-based  standard  to  an
international  standard.  The  HL7  standards  are  international  standards.  There  are
other  standards  as  well.  Disease  and  public  health  are  not  controlled  by  state  or
international  borders.  So  we  have  to  consider  the  global  harmonization  of  some  of
the  standards  we  use  in  U.S.  health  care,  especially  terminology  and  classification
standards used for clinical care.

I  am  sorry  to  report  that  the  U.S.  is  behind  in  this  matter.  I  alluded  to  the  re-
straints  in  some  of  our  classification  systems.  While  most  of  the  world  is  using  the
current WHO ICD–10 classification standard for disease or a modification of it, the
U.S.  remains  over  10  years  behind,  still  using  ICD–9–CM  for  morbidity  reporting,
a  version  developed  in  the  1970’s.  While  U.S.  uses  ICD–10  for  reporting  mortality
information,  we  run  into  situations  such  that,  currently,  until  the  next  change  in
codes, the U.S. can report that you died of avian flu, but cannot report that you sur-
vived  avian  flu.  Similar  delays  have  occurred  with  other  outbreaks  since  the  ICD–
9–CM  numeric  classification  cannot  accommodate  the  WHO  ICD–10  alpha-numeric
codes,  making  it  necessary  for  the  U.S.  to  manufacture  an  alternative  code  when
needed  and  when  possible.  When  we  exchange  information  with  most  other  coun-
tries,  the  codes  must  be  converted,  and  information  coming  from  outside  the  U.S.,
has to be maintained in a separate database.

WHO has begun the process to update ICD–10 to the next version ICD–11. A final
ICD–11  classification  is  expected  in  eight  or  nine  years.  ICD–11  is  based  on  the
ICD–10  structure,  and  its  development  will  be  based  on  the  use  of  ICD–10,  which
limits  U.S.  input.  We  are  concerned  that  the  failure  to  move  our  national
terminologies  and  classification  forward  in  sync  with  international  progression
leaves our health care industry behind and exposes our public health system to ad-
ditional  barriers  and  costs  because  we  have  not  kept  up  with  public  health  in  the
rest of the world.

We  believe  our  recommendations  related  to  terminologies  and  classifications  will
help  change  our  role  in  the  international  community.  Groups  like  the  HL7  should
continue  to  be  encouraged  to  develop  standards  for  clinical  care  information  ex-
change that are international in flavor. While our reimbursement systems might dif-
fer, our ability to share data for clinical care, research, and public health should not
be  restrained.  The  U.S.  is  a  world  leader  in  health  research  and  technology  and  a
move to insure international standards can only help make our role internationally
stronger.

Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Hall,  this  concludes  my  responses  to  the  Committee’s  ques-
tions. There has been remarkable progress in the last four years to move health care
from paper to a technology enabled inter-operable system. Developing and deploying
standards is fundamental prerequisite. But so is sound policy and sound governance
to ensure that technology and policy are aligned and are being advanced over time.
This is an effort that requires the full engagement of all three sectors of our society,
government,  industry  and  the  private  non-profit.  It  is  not  a  project  like  Y2K  that
has  an  end  point.  It  is  a  process  that  requires  a  long-term  view  and  a  public  and
private commitment to the public good. Federal and State funding is required as is
the  authority  that  can  only  come  through  intelligent  government  action.  The  HIM
profession and AHIMA stand ready to work with Congress, the Administration, and
our  health  care  colleagues  to  continue  on  a  path  that  becomes  ever  more  critical.
I  thank  you  for  your  invitation,  your  time,  and  your  attention,  and  I  am  ready

to answerer any questions you might have.

Thank you again.

STATEMENT OF MR. MICHAEL RAYMER, VICE PRESIDENT AND
GENERAL  MANAGER,  GLOBAL  PRODUCT  STRATEGY,  GE
HEALTHCARE INTEGRATED IT SOLUTIONS
Mr.  RAYMER.  Well,  good  morning,  Chairman  Gordon  and  Com-
mittee Members. My name is Michael Raymer, and I am vice presi-
dent  and  general  manager,  responsible  for  global  product  strategy
for  GE’s  Integrated  IT  Solutions.  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  this
morning to testify.

As a large purchaser of health care services, GE very much sup-
ports  the  goal  of  creating  a  nationwide  health-information  infra-
structure  that  we  believe  will  save  time,  money,  and  most  impor-
tantly  lives.  To  that  end,  we  support  initiatives  to  coordinate  the
work of the various Federal and State agencies and the private sec-
tor  in  achieving  that  goal.  It  is  important,  however,  that  this  co-
ordination does not interfere with the valuable work that has been
done today.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, is
charged  with  developing  and  promoting  measurement,  standards,
and  technology  to  enhance  productivity,  facilitate  trade  and  im-
prove  the  quality  of  life.  While  NIST’s  portfolio  is  not  specific  to
health care, much of the research done at NIST’s laboratories with
respect  to  advancing  the  Nation’s  technology  infrastructures  is  di-
rectly  applicable  to  the  creation  of  an  NHIN,  or  National  Health
Information  Network.  H.R.  2406  envisions  an  expanded  role  for
NIST in the development of HIT. GE supports NIST’s increased in-
volvement,  but  not  at  the  expense  of  processes  that  have  been
working well, to date.

We  believe  there  are  four  areas  in  which  NIST  can  provide  and
can  be  most  valuable  in  advancing  this  national  resource.  One  is
to  facilitate  coordination  among  the  federal  agencies.  The  2005
memo  of  understanding  between  Health  and  Human  Services  and
the Department of Commerce charges NIST with the responsibility
of  strategic  policy  and  program  coordination  among  the  federal
agencies. While such an effort is a lot like herding cats, we believe
NIST has the capability and should be given the opportunity to fill
this  mandate.  NIST’s  role  would  not  be  to  create  standards  or  to
certify standards, but to work with other governmental agencies to
ensure that existing standards are implemented appropriately.

Secondly, we believe that NIST can enhance the already effective
HITSP  process.  HITSP  recommends  a  best  practice  in  public/pri-
vate collaboration. We should be wary of any action that would re-
sult  in  diminishing  the  effectiveness  of  this  group.  That  said,  we
believe  it  is  possible  to  build  upon  the  current  successes  of  HITSP
and CCHIT, and NIST can play a very important role in that proc-
ess.  To  ensure  this,  we  suggest  that  HITSP  be  specifically  recog-
nized  in  this  legislation  and  that  NIST  authority  should  enforce
federal  agency  compliance  with  standards,  and  implementation
should be strengthened.

Thirdly,  to  provide  coordination  for  testing  of  inter-operability
standards:  the  utility  of  inter-operability  testing  is  to  demonstrate
that products comply with a defined set of standards. Over the past
10  years,  the  IHE  Connectathon  has  proven  to  be  an  effective,
transparent testing process. Development of a parallel testing proc-
ess,  as  currently  being  contemplated  by  CCHIT,  would  waste  cer-
tification  resources  on  duplicative  efforts.  To  the  extent  there  are
testing  processes  not  within  the  scope  of  the  Connectathon,  and
there  is  room  for  CCHIT  or  other  entities,  either  alone  or  in  com-
bination  in  the  context  of  both  private  and  public  collaboration  to
develop their own testing processes, NIST could help oversee these
efforts to ensure there is no duplication.

Finally,  fourth,  focused  research  on  areas  not  covered  by  HITSP
or  other  public/private-sector  activities:  there  is  certainly  room
among  all  of  the  other  activities  for  NIST’s  extensive  research  ca-
pabilities,  especially  in  areas  where  the  agency  has  particular  ex-
pertise.  These  would  include,  one,  investigating  information  tech-
nology  to  support  and  pay  for  performance;  secondly,  harmoni-
zation of security standards and practices; and third, working with
the  private  sector  to  provide  clarity  in  HIPAA  security  regulation
and guidance.

In  summary,  NIST  has  played  a  role  and  continues  to  play  an
effective  role  in  coordinating  the  efforts  of  public  and  private  sec-
tors towards developing HIT. Our support for extending or expand-
ing  NIST’s  participation  in  these  activities  is  contingent  upon  the
agency  leveraging  its  strengths  and  not  duplicating  or  reinventing
good  work  that  is  currently  being  carried  by  other  public/private
entities. On behalf of GE Healthcare, Mr. Chairman, I want to ex-
press  my  gratitude  for  the  opportunity  to  share  with  you  our  own
perspective on creating a nationwide health-information infrastruc-
ture.  I  would  be  happy  to  answer  any  questions  that  you  and  the
Committee may have.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL RAYMER

Good morning. My name is Michael Raymer, and I am Vice President and General
Manager  of  global  product  strategy  for  GE  Healthcare  Integrated  IT  Solutions.  I
want to thank the Committee for giving me the opportunity to testify today.

GE  supports  the  goal  of  creating  a  nationwide  health  information  infrastructure.
To  that  end,  we  also  support  initiatives  to  coordinate  the  work  of  various  federal
and  State  agencies  and  the  private  sector  in  achieving  that  goal.  It  is  important,
however,  that  this  coordination  does  not  interfere  with  the  valuable  work  that  has
been done to date.
GE’s Role in Promoting Inter-operability

GE has a long history of successfully driving open, standards-based data exchange
with  other  vendors.  The  earliest  example  is  the  Digital  Imaging  and  Communica-
tions in Medicine (DICOM) standard, which has enabled diagnostic imaging devices
and software systems to exchange images and related information regardless of ven-
dor.  Diagnostic  imaging  vendors  historically  created  proprietary  formats  for  the  CT
or  MR  images  created  by  their  systems.  While  image  exchange  was  inter-operable
between systems supplied by the same vendor, this was not the case among systems
supplied  by  competing  vendors.  This  lock-in  limited  the  flexibility  of  hospital  radi-
ology departments to utilize imaging technology in an optimum fashion. DICOM al-
lowed images to move from system to system, enabled hospitals to centralize storage
of  images  to  reduce  costs,  and  led  the  radiology  department  to  move  towards  diag-
nosing images on a computer screen. Consequently, DICOM enabled the creation of
today’s  $2  billion  picture  archiving  and  communications  systems  (PACS)  market,
while  also  enabling  many  hospitals  to  eliminate  one  of  their  highest  expenses  from
their operating budgets: film. PACS has transformed the work flow within the radi-
ology  department,  leading  to  increased  efficiency  and  higher  quality  of  care.  Physi-
cians  at  different  locations  can  consult  while  simultaneously  examining  the  same
images  and  comparing  them  with  other  clinical  results  to  get  a  more  complete  pic-
ture of the patient’s condition.

GE  has  been  instrumental  in  HL7  standards  efforts,  representing  users  and  ven-
dors in the definition of clinical document sharing and context setting (user and pa-
tient) standards. GE’s Centricity® EMR was the first major health care information
system  to  provide  a  production-ready  CCOW-compliant  product.  GE  also  worked
with  the  HL7  board  and  industry  vendors  to  define  strategies  for  broad  vendor
adoption of CCOW.

And,  GE  is  one  of  the  founders  of  the  Health  Information  and  Management  Sys-
tems  Society  (HIMSS)  EHR  Vendor  Association  (EHRVA),  a  group  of  the  top  42
EHR  vendors  committed  to  making  EMRs  inter-operable  and  to  accelerating  EMR
adoption in hospital and ambulatory care settings. EHRVA is playing a pivotal role
in creating and driving a single set of standards for electronic health records inter-
operability,  similar  to  the  role  NEMA  played  in  transforming  diagnostic  imaging
inter-operability in the 1990s. Standards for electronic medical records are complex,
because they involve multiple types of data and terminologies that are not 100 per-
cent  congruent  from  one  specialty  to  the  next—or  even  from  one  hospital  to  the
next.

GE  is  a  co-author  of  the  EHRVA  Inter-operability  Roadmap—an  effort  to  articu-
late an achievable path to inter-operability. The roadmap sets out a phased timeline
for the inter-operability needed to implement a nationwide health information infra-
structure (NHIN). The first phase of that roadmap was demonstrated at the HIMSS
Conference  in  2006,  with  GE  joining  37  other  IT  vendors,  including  the  VA  and
DOD, in showcasing multiple inter-operability use-cases. One of the NHIN pilot im-
plementations used several aspects of the roadmap, and GE and EHRVA are reach-
ing out to other stakeholders to encourage further implementation and convergence
of the roadmap.1

Don  Woodlock,  GE  Healthcare’s  General  Manager  of  Imaging  Solutions,  was  the
only speaker at the Secretarial Summit on Health Information Technology, July 21,
2004,  to  advocate  open,  standards-based  inter-operability.  And  numerous  GE  em-
ployees contribute their time and energy to establishing and staffing bodies, includ-
ing the Certification Commission for Health IT (CCHIT) and the Health Information
Technology Standards Panel (HITSP).
IHE: A Proven Inter-operability Development Process

GE  has  also  been  a  long-term  leader  in  Integrating  the  Healthcare  Enterprise

clinical IT. IHE was established in 1998 by the Radiological Society of North Amer-
ica  (RSNA)  and  HIMSS.  At  that  time,  the  popularity  of  DICOM  led  to  the  desire
to improve imaging information exchange beyond the radiology department to other
clinical IT systems in the hospital. Early on IHE recognized that solving health care
inter-operability  problems  sometimes  requires  multiple  standards,  and  established
a  process  that  allowed  multiple  standards  to  be  profiled  and  specified  in  a  precise
manner  to  resolve  work  flow  challenges  while  maintaining  plug-and-play  capabili-
ties.

IHE defines precise inter-operability specifications to ensure truly compatible im-
plementations  by  different  vendors.  IHE  couples  these  specifications  with  a  com-
prehensive  testing  process,  the  IHE  Connectathon.  These  inter-operability  show-
cases, held at major industry conferences, encourage competing vendors to build and
demonstrate  data  exchange  between  their  products,  in  a  collaborative  and  trans-
parent  process.  This  includes  laboratory  results,  radiology  images,  medical  sum-
maries, and cardiology reports—the very information that today is often still faxed,
couriered,  or  mailed  between  the  majority  of  health  care  organizations  in  the  U.S.
Beginning  with  the  2005  HIMSS  Conference  IHE  Cross-Enterprise  Showcase,  14
companies—including  seven  EHRVA  members  and  NIST—demonstrated  the  docu-
ment-sharing health information exchange concept using medical summary informa-
tion, lab reports, static text reports (.pdfs), and structured information. The product
demonstrations  focused  on  use  cases  that  would  enable  plug-and-play  inter-oper-
ability  with  the  types  of  clinical  information  that  patients  and  clinicians  utilize  in
typical medical settings.

IHE’s  implementation  and  testing  process  has  been  leveraged  by  many  countries
and regions around the world, including the United States (through HITSP), France,
Canada, Austria, Italy, and Japan. In the spring of 2005, for example, 16 European
vendors  participated  in  the  IHE-Europe  Connectathon  for  cross-enterprise  informa-
tion exchange; this has since grown to more than 70 companies participating in the
North  American  and  European  IHE  Connectathon  process.  The  IHE  Cross-Enter-
prise  Document  Sharing  (XDS)  profile  and  associated  integration  profiles  achieved
connectivity  between  inpatient  and  ambulatory  EHR  systems  (including  products
from different EU countries) that had not previously communicated. By establishing
a larger-scale market for HIT inter-operability, IHE helps reduce the cost of achiev-
ing  inter-operability  and  makes  the  inherent  technology  risk  more  acceptable  for
vendors.  The  backbone  of  the  HITSP  health  information  exchange  infrastructure
utilizes  many  of  the  same  IHE  inter-operability  specifications  that  are  already  rec-
ognized and being deployed around the world.
The Role of NIST Today

The  National  Institute  of  Science  and  Technology  (NIST)  is  charged  with  devel-
oping  and  promoting  measurement,  standards,  and  technology  to  enhance  produc-
tivity,  facilitate  trade,  and  improve  the  quality  of  life.  While  NIST’s  portfolio  is  not
specific  to  health  care,  much  of  the  research  done  at  the  NIST  Laboratories  with
respect  to  advancing  the  Nation’s  technology  infrastructure  is  directly  applicable  to
the  creation  of  an  NHIN.  Further,  virtually  all  of  NIST’s  projects  are  conducted  in
cooperation with a wide variety of public and private stakeholders.

Within the health care realm, NIST Information Technology Laboratory has been
involved  with  IHE  on  the  development  of  XDS,  which  was  adopted  by  EHRVA  as
the approach to electronic health information sharing for the Inter-operability Road-
map.  NIST  provided  a  test  environment  for  vendors  to  test  their  implementations,
and coordinated specification development with the web-services standards develop-
ment organization OASIS that provided the standards used to implement XDS.

NIST  is  also  an  invaluable  resource  in  the  area  of  data  security  and  privacy.  Be-
cause  of  the  sensitivity  of  personal  medical  information,  consumer  opposition  to  an
NHIN  largely  centers  on  concern  about  unauthorized  access  to  and  misuse  of  med-
ical  records.  Among  the  methodologies  pioneered  by  NIST  is  role-based  access  con-
trol—technology that limits the type of information that can be viewed by any indi-
vidual  depending  on  that  individual’s  function.  So,  for  example,  hospital-billing
clerks  would  be  authorized  to  see  only  the  parts  of  a  patient’s  medical  record  nec-
essary to generate invoices for a specific admission, while physicians with access to
the  same  system  would  be  able  to  see  the  patient’s  entire  medical  history.  NIST’s
expertise in data security can both accelerate the process of achieving an NHIN, and
enhance public confidence in those efforts.
A Future Role for NIST

H.R.  2406  envisions  an  expanded  role  for  NIST  in  the  development  of  HIT.  GE
supports  NIST’s  increased  involvement—but  not  at  the  expense  of  processes  that
are already working well, such as HITSP. We note also that NIST has not yet been

allowed to fulfill its role under the 2005 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) be-
tween  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (HHS)  and  the  Department
of Commerce (DOC).

The areas where we believe NIST can be most valuable are:

• Facilitate coordination among federal agencies.

The 2005 MOU charges NIST with the responsibility for strategic, policy, and
program  coordination  among  federal  agencies.  While  such  an  effort  is  often
likened to ‘‘herding cats,’’ we believe that NIST has the capability and should
be given the opportunity to fulfill this mandate.
The Federal Government is the largest health care payer in the country, and
therefore  stands  to  benefit  the  most  from  the  increased  efficiencies  and  cost-
savings that can be garnered through HIT. NIST’s role would not be to create
or  certify  standards,  but  to  work  with  other  government  agencies  to  ensure
that existing standards are being implemented appropriately.

• Enhance the already effective HITSP process.

HITSP  represents  a  best  practice  in  public/private  collaboration.  We  should
be  wary  of  any  action  that  would  result  in  diminishing  the  effectiveness  of
this  group.  That  said,  we  believe  it  is  possible  to  build  on  the  current  suc-
cesses  of  HITSP  (and  of  CCHIT),  and  NIST  can  play  an  important  role  in
doing so. To ensure this, we suggest that HITSP be specifically recognized in
this legislation.
As a facilitator and coordinator among other federal agencies, NIST can help
to accelerate the HITSP process by working between meetings to achieve con-
sensus among the public sector participants. And NIST’s authority to enforce
federal  agency  compliance  with  standards 
implementation  should  be
strengthened.
NIST’s  track  record  of  promoting  collaboration  through  IHE  demonstrates
that it can also play an effective facilitation role in the private sector.
Finally,  NIST  can  serve  as  a  resource  to  State  governments,  helping  to  dis-
seminate  information  about  technology  roadmaps  and  other  information  that
is available to support local HIT efforts.

• Provide coordination for testing inter-operability standards.

The utility of inter-operability testing is to demonstrate that products comply
with  a  defined  set  of  standards.  Over  the  past  10  years,  the  IHE
Connectathon  has  proven  to  be  an  effective,  transparent  testing  process.  De-
velopment of a parallel testing process, as CCHIT has proposed, covering the
same standards can be done only to the detriment of the industry. We should
not waste certification resources on duplicative efforts, and we should not ask
vendors—who  have  already  contributed  to  creation  of  the  IHE  process—to
pay  a  second  time,  in  the  form  of  increased  CCHIT  certification  costs.  And
if the parallel processes yield disparate results for the same product, it would
undercut the underlying rationale for certification.
To  the  extent  there  are  testing  processes  not  within  the  scope  of  the
Connectathon,  there  is  room  for  CCHIT  or  other  entities—either  alone  or  in
the  context  of  a  public/private  collaboration—to  develop  their  own  testing
processes.  NIST  could  help  to  oversee  these  efforts  and  ensure  that  there  is
no  duplication.  NIST’s  position  within  the  DOC  makes  it  uniquely  suited  to
drive global standards harmonization.
In other industries, NIST has effectively served as a single clearinghouse for
testing  tools,  whether  they  were  created  by  NIST  or  by  another  entity.  We
suggest  that  NIST  should  be  given  the  same  responsibility  with  respect  to
inter-operability standards, working in conjunction with HITSP.

• Focus research on areas not currently covered by HITSP and other public/pri-

vate sector activities.
There  is  certainly  room  amid  all  these  other  activities  for  NIST’s  extensive
research capabilities, especially in areas where the agency has particular ex-
pertise. These include:

1. Investigating  the  information  technology  necessary  to  support  pay-for-

performance program.

2. Harmonization  of  security  standards  and  practices,  especially  with  re-
spect to the ‘‘four As’’ identified by HISPC (authentication, authorization,

53

access,  and  audit),  and  making  robust  authentication  more  accessible  to
the consumer.

3. Working  with  the  private  sector  and  HHS  to  provide  clarity  in  HIPAA

security regulation guidance.

Summary

NIST  has  played,  and  can  continue  to  play,  an  effective  role  in  coordinating  the
efforts of the public and private sectors toward developing HIT. Our support for ex-
panding  NIST’s  participation  in  these  activities  is  contingent  on  the  agency
leveraging  its  strengths,  and  not  duplicating  or  reinventing  the  good  work  that  is
currently  being  carried  out  by  other  public/private  entities.  NIST’s  research  activi-
ties  should  be  directed  to  the  areas  where  there  are  currently  gaps,  such  as  data
security.

With respect to HISTP, we believe that NIST’s highest and best use is to facilitate
communication  and  consensus  among  the  government  entities  represented.  NIST
can  also  help  coordinate  efforts  in  the  private  sector  with  respect  to  the  efficiency
and effectiveness of inter-operability testing.

BIOGRAPHY FOR MICHAEL RAYMER

Mike  Raymer  leads  a  strategic  team  that  drives  global  clinical  and  financial/ad-
ministrative  product  strategy,  evaluates  new  business  initiatives,  provides  market
analysis  and  research,  optimizes  strategic  partnerships,  and  monitors  government

Member Hall, Dr. Gingrey, and distinguished Members of the Com-
mittee  and  staff.  My  name  is  Justin  Barnes.  I  am  the  vice  presi-

Technologies,  a  leading  provider  of  integrated  electronic  health
record  practice  management  and  inter-operability-software  solu-
tions for physicians practices. It is always a great honor and pleas-
ure to work with Members of Congress and their staff, as I believe
we all have a common goal to shape the face of the health care in-
dustry  by  utilizing  the  vast  contributions  that  you  have  heard
about today that IT offers health care providers, patients, and pay-
ers in achieving goals of reduced medical errors, lower costs, better
quality,  and  improved  efficiency  within  our  nation’s  health  care
system.

In  addition  to  representing  Greenway,  I  am  a  board  member  of
HIMSS  Electronic  Health  Records  Vendors  Association,  the
EHRVA,  which  is  comprised  of  the  Nation’s  leading  EHR  compa-
nies,  currently  representing  roughly  96  percent  of  all  EHRs  imple-
mented in America today. In addition, I reside on the Board of the
National  Governors  Association  Health  Information  Protection
Task Force and the Certification Commission for Healthcare Infor-
mation Technology, CCHIT, Privacy Expert Panel.

My  perspective  today  will  be  that  of  a  small  business  software
and  services  provider  that  is  actively  engaging  every  facet  of  the
health  care  industry  to  support  developing  a  national  strategy  for
the  widespread  adoption  of  health-information  technology  and  for
converting  this  adoption  into  quality  and  efficiency  improvements.
The  faster  we  align  incentive,  technical  standards,  and  guideline
requirements, the faster we improve care, increase quality, contain
costs, and save lives.

This statement focuses on Greenway’s and our industry’s dedica-
tion  to  assisting  Congress,  the  U.S.  House  Committee  on  Science
and Technology, and the National Institute of Standards and Tech-
nology  in  their  goals  of  supporting  the  integration  of  the  health
care  information  enterprises.  In  this  pursuit,  Greenway,  HIMSS,
and the EHRVA support a truly transparent process and equal co-
operation  of  public  and  private  entities.  This  collaboration  has
proven, recently, to reduce barriers with federal regulations as well
as  barriers  with  harmonizing  standards.  Over  the  past  few  years,
Greenway and the entire health care industry has made significant
strides  with  EHR  adoption,  standards  convergence,  inter-oper-
ability,  and  improving  ROI  for  long-term  sustainability  of  our  na-
tion’s  health  care  transformation  process.  Specifically,  Greenway
customer  practices  now  have  the  opportunity  for  inter-operability
among their local community which encompasses regional care pro-
viders,  patients,  and  hospitals.  Our  customers  alone  have  realized
annual  $21,000  to  $81,000  on  post-implementation  return  on  in-
vestment  per  physician.  With  paperwork  reduced,  collections  in-
creased  and  coding  improved,  physicians  provide  a  higher  quality
of care and also operate a more efficient business.

While  HIT  and  EHR  adoption  currently  grows  at  a  record  pace,
we  possess  the  responsibility  to  ensure  that  every  policy  enacted
and  every  rule  that  is  proposed  must  sustain  our  current  invest-
ment  and  progress.  We  applaud  the  focus  that  the  President,  Con-
gress,  and  HHS  have  applied  to  this  industry  transformation,  but
we must ensure that all decisions are created by entities that have
the essential experience, dedication and factual evidence necessary
to  put  plans  and  policy  in  place.  An  example  of  a  Greenway-,

HIMSS-  and  the  EHRVA-endorsed  article  of  legislation  is  H.R.
2377,  the  ADOPT  Act  of  2007,  which  uses  section  179  of  the  tax
code to provide physician purchasing incentives that can further in-
crease  HIT  adoption  by  reducing  upfront  practice  costs  of  the  first
year  of  EHR  implementation.  This  bill  has  currently  been  intro-
duced in the House.

Greenway  applauds  the  efforts  to  authorize  NIST  to  increase  its
efforts  in  support  of  the  integration  of  the  health  care  information
enterprise.  NIST  already  plays  and  import  role  in  public  and  pri-
vate sector collaboration, such as Integrating the Healthcare Enter-
prise  (IHE),  and  the  Health  Information  Technology  Standards
Panel  (HITSP),  and  that  role  should  be  maintained.  In  addition,
NIST  should  be  encouraged  to  work  collaboratively  to  make  these
initiatives even more effective, and Congress can assist by formally
recognizing  HITSP  in  any  legislative  language.  HITSP  is  a  best
practice  because  of  its  public  and  private  collaboration,  trans-
parency, and use of multi-stakeholder processes like IHE. IHE has
a 10-year legacy of standards and testing harmonization with glob-
al  ramifications,  and  for  that  reason,  it  is  imperative  for  NIST  to
recognize HITSP and IHE processes.

From  a  financial  investment  standpoint,  it  is  estimated  that  the
private  sector  has  invested  $50  to  $100  million,  collectively,  in  the
past  few  years  following  IHE,  HITSP  and  certification  initiatives,
and  that  has  resulted  in  the  important  areas  of  HIT  adoption  and
inter-operability. More momentum has been created nationally and
internationally in these areas than ever before. While this momen-
tum  could  be  better,  it  is  crucial  that  influential  bodies  like  Con-
gress,  the  President  Administration  and  NIST  work  together  to
maintain  this  impetus  and  not  create  alternative  de  facto  testing
standards or certification authority.

It is an exciting time to help and guide and sustain the momen-
tum  in  the  health  care  information  technology  industry.  We  have
the  opportunity  to  create  the  most  efficient  health  care  system  in
the  world,  and  while  this  is  daunting  challenge,  it  is  certainly
achievable.  If  we  continue  to  work  together  in  public  and  private
collaboration,  build  on  present  successes  with  HITSP  and  take  the
prudent  and  fiscally  reasonable  steps  necessary,  we  will  achieve
health transition goal and recognize the estimate $100 to $200 bil-
lion  in  U.S.  annual  saving  with  a  fully  integrated  and  inter-oper-
able health care system.

Speaking  on  behalf  of  the  private  sector,  we  are  ready  as  an  in-
dustry  to  continue  our  process  and  partnership  with  Congress  and
federal agencies in making these goals a reality. Chairman Gordon
and distinguished Members of Congress and staff, I want to thank
you  for  this  opportunity  and  your  dedication  to  the  integration  of
the  health  care  information  enterprise.  I  hope  my  comments  will
help steer ideas and thoughts that can be transmitted into innova-
tive  policies  shaping  the  future  of  health  care  in  this  country.
Thank you very much.

Technologies,  a  leading  provider  of  integrated  electronic  health  record  (EHR),  prac-
tice  management  and  inter-operability  software  solutions  for  physicians’  practices.
It is always a great honor and pleasure to work with Members of Congress and their
staff  as  I  believe  we  all  have  a  common  goal  to  shape  the  new  face  of  the  health
care industry by utilizing the vast contributions that information technology (IT) of-
fers health care providers, patients and payers in achieving goals of reduced medical
errors, lower costs, better quality and improved efficiency within our nation’s health
care system.

In  addition  to  representing  Greenway,  I  am  a  board  member  of  the  HIMSS  Elec-
tronic  Health  Record  Vendor’s  Association  (EHRVA)  which  is  comprised  of  the  Na-
tion’s  leading  EHR  companies  currently  representing  roughly  96  percent  of  all
EHR’s implemented in America today. In addition, I reside on the board of the Na-
tional  Governors  Association  (NGA)  Health  Information  Protection  Task  Force  and
the  Certification  Commission  for  Healthcare  Information  Technology  (CCHIT)  Pri-
vacy  Expert  Panel.  My  perspective  today  will  be  that  of  a  small  business  software
and services provider that is actively engaging every facet of the health care indus-
try  to  support  developing  a  national  strategy  for  widespread  adoption  of  health  in-
formation  technology  (HIT)  and  for  converting  this  adoption  into  quality  and  effi-
ciency improvements. The faster we align incentives, technical standards and guide-
line  requirements,  the  faster  we  improve  care,  increase  quality,  contain  costs  and
save lives.

This  statement  focuses  on  Greenway’s  and  our  industry’s  dedication  to  assisting
Congress,  the  U.S.  House  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  and  the  National
Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  in  their  goals  of  supporting  the  inte-
gration  of  the  health  care  information  enterprise  in  the  United  States.  In  this  pur-
suit,  Greenway,  HIMSS  and  the  EHRVA  support  a  truly  transparent  process  and
equal  collaboration  of  public  and  private  entities.  This  collaboration  has  proven  re-
cently  to  reduce  barriers  with  federal  regulations  as  well  as  barriers  with  harmo-
nizing standards. Over the past few years, Greenway and the entire health care in-
dustry  has  made  significant  strides  with  EHR  adoption,  standards  convergence,
inter-operability and proven return on investment (ROI) for long-term sustainability
of  our  nation’s  health  care  transformation  process.  Specifically,  Greenway  customer
practices  now  have  the  opportunity  for  inter-operability  among  their  local  commu-
nity  which  encompasses  regional  care  providers,  patients  and  hospitals.  Our  cus-
tomers  alone  have  realized  an  annual  $21,600  to  $81,500  post-implementation  ROI
per  physician.  With  paperwork  reduced,  collections  increased  and  coding  improved,
physicians  provide  a  higher  quality  of  care  and  also  operate  a  more  efficient  busi-
ness.

While  HIT  and  EHR  adoption  currently  grows  at  a  record  pace,  we  possess  the
responsibility  to  ensure  that  every  policy  enacted  and  every  rule  that  is  proposed
must  sustain  our  current  investments  and  progress.  While  we  applaud  the  focus
that the President, Congress and the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services
have applied to this industry transformation, we must ensure that all decisions are
created  by  entities  that  have  the  essential  experience,  dedication  and  factual  evi-
dence  necessary  to  put  self-sustaining  plans  and  policy  in  place.  An  example  of  a
Greenway,  HIMSS  and  EHRVA-endorsed  article  of  legislation  is  U.S.  House  bill
2377, the ADOPT HIT Act of 2007, which uses Section 179 of the tax code to provide
physician purchasing incentives that can further increase HIT adoption by reducing
up-front practice costs over the first year of EHR implementation. This bill has been
introduced in the U.S. House.

Greenway  applauds  your  efforts  to  authorize  NIST  to  increase  its  efforts  in  sup-
port  of  the  integration  of  the  health  care  information  enterprise  in  the  United
States. NIST already plays an important role in public and private sector collabora-
tions such as Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) and the Health Informa-
tion  Technology  Standards  Panel  (HITSP)  and  that  role  should  be  maintained.  In
addition,  NIST  should  be  encouraged  to  work  collaboratively  to  make  these  initia-
tives even more effective and Congress can assist by formally recognizing HITSP in
any  legislative  language.  HITSP  is  a  best  practice  because  of  its  public  and  private
collaboration,  transparency  and  use  of  multi-stakeholder  processes  like  IHE.  IHE
has  a  10-year  legacy  of  standards  and  testing  harmonization  with  global  ramifica-
tions  and  for  that  reason,  it  is  imperative  for  NIST  to  recognize  HITSP  and  IHE
processes.

From a financial investment standpoint, it is estimated that the private sector has
invested  $50  million–$100  million  collectively  in  the  past  few  years  following  IHE,
HITSP  and  certification  initiatives  and  that  has  resulted  in  a  health  care  trans-
formation  in  the  important  areas  of  HIT  adoption  and  inter-operability.  More  mo-
mentum  has  been  created  nationally  and  internationally  in  these  areas  than  ever
before.  While  this  momentum  could  be  better,  it  is  crucial  that  influential  bodies

like  Congress,  the  President’s  Administration  and  NIST  work  together  to  maintain
this impetus and not create a new alternative de facto testing, standards or certifi-
cation authority.

This  is  an  exciting  time  to  help  guide  and  sustain  the  momentum  in  the  health
care  information  technology  industry.  We  have  the  opportunity  to  create  the  most
efficient  health  care  system  in  the  world  and  while  this  is  a  daunting  challenge,  it
is certainly achievable. If we continue to work together in public and private collabo-
ration, build on present successes with HITSP and take the prudent and fiscally re-
sponsible steps necessary, we will achieve our health care transformation goals and
recognize  the  estimated  $100–$200  billion  of  U.S.  annual  savings  with  a  fully-inte-
grated and inter-operable health care system. Speaking on behalf of the private sec-
tor,  we  are  ready  as  an  industry  to  continue  our  progress  in  partnership  with  Con-
gress and federal agencies in making these goals a reality.

Chairman Gordon and distinguished Members of the Committee and staff, I want
to  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  and  your  dedication  to  the  integration  of  the
health  care  information  enterprise.  I  hope  that  my  comments  will  help  steer  ideas
and thoughts that can be transmitted into innovative policies shaping the future of
health care in this country. Thank you very much.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  GORDON.  I  bet  you  were  getting  ready  to  say  some-

thing good there.

Mr. BARNES. Thank you.
Chairman  GORDON.  We  have  only  two  minutes,  so  we  are  going
to  have  to  go  vote.  I  hope  we  will  be  back  in  15  or  20.  And  so  the
Committee will be in recess.

[Recess.]
Chairman  GORDON.  Ms.  Williams,  you  had,  I  think,  indicated
some concern that there is a number of folks working on this issue,
and would NIST just be one more, and there is going to be a prob-
lem. You know, hopefully that is not the case. I think the intention
is that we need to have somebody that is going to coordinate these
activities,  and  I  would  remind  you  back,  I  guess  it  was  in  1990,
that  HHS  was  directed,  through  the  Nutrition  and  Labeling  Edu-
cation  Act,  to  develop  standards  for  baby  food.  Eight  years  later,
they didn’t get it done, and so they turned it over to NIST, and six
months  later  it  was  done.  That  is  what  we  want  to  try  to  accom-
plish.

And Ms. Kloss, you have generally been positive about the health
IT standards panel process, of which you are a member, but as you
point  out,  it  is  largely  a  voluntary  organization  with  a  lack  of  pro-
fessional  staff  resources.  For  such  a  critical  task  as  advancing
health  care  IT  and  operability,  doesn’t  it  make  sense  that  the  pri-
mary-standards-harmonization work be guided by a federal agency
such as NIST rather than a voluntary organization?

Ms. KLOSS. Well, we think it is quite important that this process
remain  a  public/private  process,  and  certainly  the  resources  and
services  of  NIST  would  be  a  huge  additional  resource  to  HITSP,
but  there  does  just  need  to  be  some  public/private  mechanism  be-
cause it is aiding adoption and learning as we go to——

Chairman  GORDON.  I  think  that  you  are  right,  and  I  think  that
is  really  the  beauty  of  NIST  in  that  it  is  a  non-regulatory  agency,
so  we  can  bring  everyone  together  without  fear  of  regulation.  This
is what they did a few years ago with financial data security. They
brought the financial industry together, helped them through a col-
laborative  process,  set  those  common  standards,  not  picking  win-
ners  or  losers,  and  then  being  able  to  have  the  test  beds  there  to
make sure that they would work.

Mr. Raymer, you note that NIST has not yet been allowed to ful-
fill  its  role  under  the  memorandum  of  understanding  between
NIST  and  HHS,  and  you  further  note  some  of  the  work  NIST  is
doing  through  the  MOU.  So  wouldn’t  you  also  agree  that  codifying
this  role  at  a  central  location  to  ensure  development  of  technical
standards would be a worthy endeavor?

Mr.  RAYMER.  Absolutely.  I  think  the  testimony,  you  know,  cov-
ered  a  variety  of  things  that  we  would  encourage  the  Committee
to  look  at  with  respect  to  what  their  role  would  be,  but  we  clearly
see  that  there  is  a  need  for  NIST  in  the  process.  And  we  believe
as  it  was  originally  conceived  under  the  memorandum  of  under-
stating,  that  that  would  be  an  appropriate  direction  for  the  Com-
mittee  to  head,  with  the  caveats  that  we  placed  in  the  testimony.

Chairman  GORDON.  And  back  to  a  real,  live  doctor,  Dr.
Silverstone,  to  what  extent  would  improved  inter-operability  with
health  care  IT  systems  in  hospitals,  labs,  and  other  medial  facili-
ties  give  medial  specialty  practices  the  confidence  to  make  the  in-
vestment in health care IT?

Dr. SILVERSTONE. You know, physicians really need to know that
the  investment  that  they  are  making  is  going  to  be  a  worthwhile
investment.  I  mean  our  practices  are  being  challenged  on  a  daily
basis  by  reimbursement  and  inter-operability  is  that  key  that  we
need  to  know  that  the  systems  that  we  purchase  are  going  to  be
able to work with other systems.

You  know,  as  a  specialty  physician,  I  am  not  the  primary-care
provider  most  of  the  time,  and  patients  are  referred  to  me,  and
when  they  are  referred,  we  have  to  recreate  the  wheel  each  time.
We  have  to  recreate  histories.  We  oftentimes  have  to  repeat  tests
because we don’t have access to the tests. Very often, patients have
been  cared  for  elsewhere,  and  we  might  be  able  to  get  that  data
in  paper  format.  Often,  we  can’t  even  get  that.  If  we  could  get  the
data  in  an  electronic  format,  then  we  would  be  able  to  continue  to
analyze the data and to put the data that we are creating alongside
that  and  provide  better  patient  care.  So  these  standards,  we  feel,
are absolutely critical.

Chairman  GORDON.  That  is  how  we  save  money  and  save  lives.
Dr. SILVERSTONE. Absolutely.
Chairman GORDON. And as I pointed out earlier, most Americans
are  treated  by  physicians  and  practices  of  five  physicians  or  less,
and  with  the  reduction  in  reimbursements,  with  difficulties  that
many  practices  face  right  now,  it  is  difficult  to  justify  trying  to
make  that  investment,  particularly  if  you  are  not  comfortable  that
it is going to be a long-range investment, and that is that whatever
software you are going to buy is going to still be the premium soft-
ware,  or  it  can  be  inter-operable  with  the  various  groups  that  you
deal  with.  So  that  is  what  we  want  to  try  to  accomplish.  But  we
need to do more than that.

The purpose of this bill is not to integrate it into the health care
offices, but rather to establish, again, those standards so that soft-
ware  can  be  developed.  Then,  quite  frankly,  we  go  to  Ways  and
Means  and  we  go  to  the  Energy  and  Commerce  Committee,  where
we need to provide incentives, both in terms of making it a govern-
ment  standard  as  well  as  trying  to—I  would  hope  we  can  provide
financial incentives for doctor and hospitals through rapid write-off
or other types of ways that we would encourage them to get on this
system.

Dr. SILVERSTONE. Chairman Gordon, I can’t agree with you more.
I  mean  this  will  absolutely  jumpstart  the  whole  process  of  making
health  information  technology  a  cornerstone  of  American  medicine
and will enable American ingenuity to really flower. I congratulate
you on this.

Chairman  GORDON.  Well,  again,  I  want  to  thank  our  witnesses
for being here. My time is up. I would like to ask Dr. Baird to chair
the  Committee,  and  I  am  sure  that  Mr.  Hall  will  give  him  plenty
of help.

Mr. BAIRD. [Presiding] Mr. Hall.

Mr.  HALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Mr.  Barnes,  you  said  that
the  private  sector  has  invested  $50  to  $100  on  certification  initia-
tives  for  HIT.  If  H.R.  2406  were  passed  into  law,  could  that  slow
down  the  progress  that  has  already  been  made  to  date,  and  if  so,
why. And if no, why not?

Mr. BARNES. In its current form, I think it could be a disruption
to the progress that we have made over the past several years. We
are  committed  to  the  progresses  that  we  have  made.  I  outlined
them  in  my  statement.  I  think  that  NIST  certainly  has  a  role.  We
have  outlined  that  here,  on  the  panel,  and  also  several  Members
up there. NIST does have a history of public and private collabora-
tion,  so  as  long  as  NIST  followed  those  guidelines  and  processes,
which I am sure they would, then they would certainly have a posi-
tive  influence  on  the  process.  But  completely  owning  the  process
and not working more collaboratively with HITSP and taking what
HITSP has done by name, not just by process or anything else, but
literally,  by  name,  then  I  think  we  could  slow  down  adoption  and
the progress that we have made.

So  if  we  could  take  specifically  HITSP’s  progress  and  move  that
into  a  forum  where  NIST  has  authority  and  maintain  its  progress
and build upon that as a foundation, then I would support that.

Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Raymer,  you  said  that  NIST  helped  to  pioneer
‘‘role-based  accessed-controlled  technology  that  limits  the  type  of
information  that  can  be  viewed  by  any  individual,  depending  upon
that individual’s function.’’ Can you elaborate a little on that?

Mr.  RAYMER.  Yes,  and  specifically  its  role  and  application  in
health care is that as there becomes more widely available health-
information  system,  a  national  health  information  infrastructure,
we  think  the  idea  of  role-based  security  is  really  critical  so  that
those individuals that have the need to know during the care-deliv-
ery workflow at the appropriate time are given the appropriate ac-
cess to the information that they need.

We  believe  NIST  could  play  an  important  role  relative  to  those
security  standards  that  could  be  more  widely  adopted.  And  NIST
has  some  history  of  having  successfully  done  this  in  other  areas
outside of health care and inside of health care.

Mr. HALL. And you also state in your testimony that you support
an  increase  in  NIST  involvement,  but  not  at  the  expense  of  the
processes that are already working well. Would you elaborate a lit-
tle on that, sir?

Mr.  RAYMER.  Well,  I  think  Mr.  Barnes  covered  that  to  some  ex-
tent in his statement. It is just HITSP, we believe, has been a valu-
able  process.  IHE  has  a  Connectathon  that  happens  each  year,
where even a wider array of vendors each year are coming together
to demonstrate the inter-operability of their products. So to the ex-
tent  that  NIST  would  derail  current  things  that  are  working,  we
think that it would be better for NIST to apply their resources; like
the  one  area  would  be  compliance  among  the  federal  agencies.  It
is  one  of  the  largest  purchasers  of  health  care  in  the  world,  and
certainly in this country.

The  government  would  greatly  benefit  from  the  utilization  of
standards,  even  within  its  own  health  care  delivery  system.  So  I
think  we  have  outlined  in  the  testimony  some  specific  areas  that
are gaps today.

61

Mr. HALL. It is an area to be careful in, isn’t it?
Mr. RAYMER. Yes, absolutely.
Mr.  HALL.  And  did  you  crank  into  your  computer  the  fact  that

NIST has never before been a body that set policy?

Mr. RAYMER. Yes.
Mr.  HALL.  You  state  in  your  testimony  that  you  ‘‘support  an  in-
crease  in  NIST  involvement,  but  not  at  the  expense  of  the  proc-
esses that are already working well.’’ And you stated that. Now, do
you  believe  that  the  passage  of  H.R.  2406  could  potentially  hurt
progress  that  has  already  been  made  in  health-information  tech-
nology?

Mr.  RAYMER.  I  think  to  the  extent  it  circumvents  or  slows  down
the  work  of  HITSP,  of  IHE,  and  other  successful  initiatives,  it
would be very damaging. I think that, you know, if the Committee
listens  to  the  testimony  today,  and  I  think  focuses  the  bill  on  di-
recting  NIST  towards  the  areas  in  which  we  are  currently  gapped
from  our  National  Health  Information  infrastructure  and  tech-
nology  platform,  that  what  you  would  do  would  be  accelerate  the
rate of adoption, because you are ensuring that resources are being
brought  to  bear  in  an  area  in  which  there  is  not  appropriate  focus
today.

Mr.  HALL.  Well,  I  think  that  is  a  good  answer.  And  I  think  that
when  the  Chairman  introduces  a  bill,  it  is  often  that  we  need  to
support that bill if at all possible, but we need to point out the pit-
falls that might show, and I think this is a very good panel to give
us  those  answers.  And  I  think  my  time  is  up,  so  I  yield  back  my
time.

I will have some questions that I wasn’t to submit to each of you
in  writing,  and  if  the  Chair  agrees  to  allow  us  to  do  that—I  ask
unanimous  consent  that  the  panel  be  asked  to  answer  our  ques-
tions that we submit to them in conjunction with this hearing.

Mr. BAIRD. Without objection.
Mr. HALL. Thank you, sir. I yield back.
Mr.  BAIRD.  I  am  sorry  I  wasn’t  able—I  had  another  hearing,  as
we often do here. From what I hear the situation seems to be that
you  have  got  some  positive  initiative  going  forward  that  seems  to
be  moving  at  pace.  We  all  recognize  that,  and  there  seems  to  be
consensus  that,  we  need  to  adopt  this  as  quickly  as  possible.  The
question is NIST does not necessarily have to approach this by say-
ing  we  are  kings  here.  We  are  going  to  set  the  standards  for  you.
Do  you  have  objection  to  NIST  providing  a  facilitative  role?  Or
maybe that is what you were saying, Mr. Raymer, a facilitative role
to  work  together  with  the  various  established  processes  to  see  if
they can’t move things a little more quickly, because it seems that
is  going  more  slowly,  so  I  want  to  open  that  up  to  anybody.  And
then,  as  part  of  that,  how  does  H.R.  2406  relate  to  that  in  your
judgment?

Mr. RAYMER. Well, to respond to your question about facilitation,
we think that there are some important roles that NIST could play.
One,  as  I  mentioned  before  would  be  to  ensure  compliance  to  the
standards  by  the  federal  agencies  themselves,  and  the  government
would benefit from that.

Secondly,  as  you  go  through  any  kind  of  collaborate,  both  public
and private collaborative, like HITSP, having this be the coordina-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:49 Feb 22, 2008 Jkt 037983 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL07\092607\37983 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

62

tion to ensure that the dialogue continues on the public side within
the governmental agencies is kind of being that guiding, facilitation
mechanism we think would be very good.

The other area is that there is some good work that goes on with
regard to testing and certification today, but as the standards move
forwards,  and  let  us  say  in  the  areas  of  role-based  security,  there
may be a specific thing and specific role that NIST may play, then,
in  covering  gaps  of  where  certification  or  testing  activities  today
are not appropriately validating the inter-operability between prod-
ucts.

So  we  do  view  there  to  be  a  role  of  facilitation,  both  within  gov-
ernment, outside of government, and more importantly, there could
be  specific  roles  that  NIST  might  have  in  providing  gaps  that
would accelerate the adoption of health care IT in the country.

Mr.  BAIRD.  Ms.  Williams,  you  seem  to  have  something  you  want
to  add.  You  might  want  to  hit  your  mic  there.  I  am  not  sure  it  is
on.

Ms.  WILLIAMS.  Thank  you.  I  generally  concur  with  Mr.  Raymer.
We think that NIST could probably play a strong role in enforcing
the standards, perhaps in implementation of those standards. I am
just not sure that they are the appropriate group to bring the pub-
lic and private sectors in step.

Mr. BAIRD. Ms. Kloss.
Ms.  KLOSS.  I  would  add  that,  with  respect,  specifically,  to  the
Certification  Commission  for  Health  IT  and  the  work  Mr.  Raymer
just referred to, that organization is now beginning to build a test-
ing  resource  and  is  hopeful  that  there  will  be  collaboration  and
that  NIST  will  bring  its  expertise  in  building  testing  beds.  Sec-
ondly,  certainly,  bringing  forth  standards  in  the  area  of  security
would  be  very  valuable  to  the  work  going  forward.  And  thirdly,  as
I  mentioned  earlier,  we  think  we  need  a  new  mechanism  study  on
how  to  look  at  clinical  terminologies  and  classifications  and  bring
that more robustly and squarely into the standards process.

Mr.  BARNES.  I  actually  would  like  just  to  add  just  a  little  bit  to
that  and  especially  where  NIST,  if  they  were  involved  before  now,
could  have  played  a  more  positive  role.  In  the  area  of  CCHIT  and
certification,  they  have  chosen  a  testing  bed  called  miter,  and
whereas  that  could  be  considered  a  duplicative  process  because
they  could  have  chosen  IHE,  which  NIST  has  been  very  involved
in. And from a vendor standpoint, that is expensive for us. We now
have  to  create  tools  to  work  with  miter  and  their  testing  bed,  and
we  have  tools  already  that  we  paid  for  and  use  on  IHE.  So  there
certainly  is  a  role  for  NIST  in  this.  I  almost  wish  it  was  a  little
bit,  maybe  sooner  regarding  that  CCHIT  item.  So  that  is  certainly
to continue on in their efforts. Yes.

Mr.  BAIRD.  One  of  the  things  we  are  working  on  elsewhere  in  a
different committee is this whole issue of national health care, and
I am a big believer in that you ought to give patients upfront infor-
mation  about  what  their  options  are  and  what  the  empirical  data
are  and  what  their  costs  are,  and  I  think  that  ought  to  be  stand-
ardized across insurance policies, so we all get the same kind of in-
formation. Is that kind of issue being addressed? Or is it right now,
you are focusing mostly on the technological aspect? But that is re-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:49 Feb 22, 2008 Jkt 037983 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL07\092607\37983 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

63

lated, because will your technology allow for that kind of data, both
collection and presentation to patients?

Ms.  KLOSS.  I  would  comment  that  that  was  the  reason  behind
our  discussion  on  classification  and  vocabulary  as  a  type  of  stand-
ard that we feel have not gotten sufficient attention. It really is the
common language of medicine that will allow this information to be
understandable  across  the  industry,  and  more  work  needs  to  be
done  on  that  to  bring  together  disparate  processes  for  developing,
maintaining  those  systems  and  keeping  them  up  to  date,  creating
crosswalks  between  them,  all  of  this  internal  information-manage-
ment work.

Mr.  BAIRD.  Thank  you.  My  time  has  expired.  I  want  to  yield  to

Dr. Gingrey.

Mr. GINGREY. Dr. Baird, thank you.
You  know,  the  entire  hearing  has  been  very,  very  informative,
and  of  course,  with  the  background  of  the  Chairman’s  bill,  I  think
all of us want to understand exactly what role that NIST will have
in regard to, if this legislation is approved.

And  I  guess  my  main  question  is,  the  President  said  a  couple  of
years ago that we want to have a fully integrated, inter-operability,
electronic  medical  records  systems  by  2014,  I  think,  was  the  dead-
line.  I  think  we  ought  to  get  there,  hopefully,  before  then.  I  think
the  need  is  so  great.  When  we  sit  here  and  talk  about  the  various
studies that suggest the amount of savings anywhere from $75 bil-
lion  to  $160  billion  a  year,  and  we  just  vote  on  a  bill,  the  S-Chip
program,  which  is  by  anybody’s  standards  a  fairly  massive  expan-
sion, we still have 40 million people in this country uninsured. We
have  got  other  needs,  war-fighting,  not  the  least  of  which.  I  mean
so  we  are  talking  about  real  money  here.  And  the  quicker  we  can
get  to  the  point  of  achieving  those  savings  and  saving  lives,  the
better.

So  I  guess  the  main  question  for  all  the  witnesses—I  will  start
with Mr., Barnes, my friend from my district from a courtesy—but
you know, is there something about what we have been doing with
the  national  coordinator,  the  HITSP  that  just  gets  into  the  realm
of  moving  too  slow,  foot-dragging,  not  getting  the  job  done?  And
what  is  that  NIST  can  do  to  put  on  the  afterburners,  if  you  will,
to make it better, and to not to—I think Mr. Barnes was expressing
some  concern  about  what  would  happen  to  the  small  vendors,  and
Mr.  Raymer,  too,  in  regard  to  the  large  vendors,  GE,  if  you  have
already gone down a certain road, based on what ONC and HITSP
have recommended, then we don’t want to undo all of that process.
So  that  is  really  my  question:  what  can  we  do  to  make  it  better,
other than the fact that maybe NIST is more recognizable acronym
than HITSP or ONC.

Mr. BARNES. Thank you very much, Dr. Gingrey. Most certainly,
there  has  been  a  lot  of  work  and  progress  over  the  last  couple  of
years,  through  the  ONC  and  leadership  through  HHS  and  by  the
President.  And  this  progress,  I  don’t  think  it  is  going  to  be—hope-
fully,  it  will  not  be  undone,  but  you  have  seen—you  have  heard  in
my  testimony  that  though  standards  harmonization  certification,
we have really increased adoption.

We obviously could have done it better. There is always a better
way  to  do  items  and  perform  tasks,  but  in  my  personal  opinion,  I

think  it  has  gone  as  smoothly—actually  surprisingly  smoothly,  as
any  of  us  have  anticipated.  GE  and  my  company,  we,  initially,
when  we  were  embarking  upon  learning  about  certification  and
standards harmonization, we certainly, naturally, had a lot of ques-
tions and concerns, and I think, now, speaking for my company di-
rectly,  we  were  pleasantly  surprised  on  the  progress  and  how  our
investment that we have made—my company alone has made over
$500,000  in  investments  in  this,  and  not  just  on  the  personal  in-
vestment  side,  but  watching  what  this  has  done  in  the  industry,
watching inter-operability come together. So it is exciting.

I  mean  we  are  watching  our  customers.  We  have  got  17,000
across  the  county  that  just  came  from  a  user  conference,  and  they
are excited. They are seeing how inter-operability is changing their
lives,  their  patients’  lives.  So  it  out  there.  It  is  successful.  It  could
be  better.  This  is  where  NIST  can  come  in.  I  mean  they  have  es-
sential  experience.  They  have  long-valued  experience  in  this  area
of  standards  and  testing,  and  so  I  think  bringing  that  knowledge
to  bear  within  the  current  processes  would  be  invaluable.  So  I
mean  I  certainly  would  encourage  NIST.  The  more  minds  that
come  together  to  make  this  a  better  process,  I  think  is  certainly
welcome,  just  not  to  modify  or  derail  all  of  the  progress  that  we
have invested in.

Mr.  GINGREY.  I  am  short  of  time,  but  I  welcome  any  other  com-

ments in regard to that.

Ms. Williams.
Ms.  WILLIAMS.  It  is  a  daunting  challenge  that  we  have,  and  I
would  say  that  IT  is  a  tool  to  help  us  solve  a  complicated  problem
in  the  health  care  system.  It  isn’t  that  we  don’t  have  any  stand-
ards. Part of the problem is that we have too many standards. The
National  Alliance  for  Health  Information  Technology  did  a  survey
recently, and the result was that, in fact, we have over 2,000 stand-
ards  in  the  health  care  industry,  with  over  400  organizations  that
are  either  developing  standards,  maintaining  standards,  or  licens-
ing  standards.  So  we  need  to  invest  the  authority  in  some  coordi-
nating  body  to  sort  through  all  of  this.  That  starts  with  a  vision,
and  the  President  laid  out  a  very  high-level  vision  for  what  we
need to achieve by 2014. We need to agree on a common vision, you
know,  sort  of  on  how  we  are  going  to  get  there,  and  then  we  need
to  agree  on  a  set  of  standards  that  will  help  us  get  there.  That
would  be  sort  of  the  rules  of  the  road  or  the  roadmap.  So  we  need
a  common  vision;  we  need  standards;  we  need  a  roadmap;  and
then,  we  need  an  implementation  process.  And  perhaps—NIST
definitely has role there in perhaps enforcing and helping with the
implementation process.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Thank  you.  My  time  expired.  And  thank  you,  Mr.

Chairman.

Mr. BAIRD. Thank you, doctor. Mr. Wu.
Mr.  WU.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  My  apologies,  I  was  called
away earlier for what I thought would be a quick vote, which took
a  long  time,  and  now,  I  have  been  told  again,  I  have  been  called
for a quick vote in my other committee, but I will risk that briefly.
And  I  want  to  ask  this  panel  a  non-standards-oriented,  a  non-
NIST-oriented question. In a field hearing and in roundtables that
we  held  on  this  topic,  in  addition  to  the  challenge  of  inter-oper-

ability  and  standards,  there  are  other  significant  barriers  to  adop-
tion  of  health  care  IT,  one  of  them  being  the  misalignment  of  cost
and  benefits.  For  example,  if  a  small  medical  group  were  to  adopt
health care IT, they would have to bear the preponderance of costs,
whereas  a  preponderance  of  benefits  would  go  upstream  some-
where, if you will, to Medicare or an insurance company and so on.
Do you have thoughts on how to either better align these financial
costs  and  benefits  or  for  some  way  for  the  beneficiaries  to  help  fi-
nance the cost of health care IT?

Mr.  RAYMER.  Well,  certainly,  GE  has  been  a  large  purchaser  of
health  care  services  in  this  county  and  are  concerned  about  the
misalignment  that  takes  place  today  in  the  care-delivery  environ-
ment. I think the movement towards pay for performance, I think,
is an important movement, and to have part of the pay for perform-
ance tried in-process clinical measures that are only possible when
you  have  an  electronic  system  in  place.  So  you  can  choose  to  do  it
on  paper,  but  your  cost  of  reporting  that  in  an  in-process  basis
would  be  more  expensive  than  the  cost  of  the  system  itself.  Also,
I  remind  you  that  CMS  put  of  1303–P  last  fall,  which  provided  a
relaxation of Stark and a Safe Harbor or health care entities to off-
set  the  cost  of  donation  for  physicians.  I  conducted  research  last
fall——

Mr.  WU.  Mr.  Raymer,  my  apologies.  Let  me  interrupt  you.  This
time,  they  tell  me  it  is  really  for  real,  and  it  is  really  urgent,  but
I  would  like  the  witnesses,  if  possible,  to  proceed  to  answer  the
questions, and I look forward to reading the answers, and my deep-
est  apologizes  to  you  all  for  this  multiple-ring  affair  that  we  have
going in the Congress.

Mr. RAYMER. Well, I was just going into 1303–P last fall, created
Safe  Harbor  and  the  exception  to  Stark  to  allow  health  care  enti-
ties  like  hospital  systems  or  integrated  delivery  networks  to  offset
up  to  85  percent  of  the  cost  of  the  EMR  for  physicians.  I  did  re-
search last fall with an independent group that identified that that
regulatory change will stimulate adoption and probably likely dou-
ble the rate of adoption over the next three years by physicians. So
you  know,  I  think  it  is  a  combination  of  a  move  towards  pay  for
performance  that  is  based  on  in-process  measures.  And  the  num-
ber-one barrier for adoption for physicians in studies that we have
done  is  all  about  economics.  And  so  if  you  couple,  you  know,  that
reimbursement will be better when you provide better care, and the
methodology  by  which  you  do  that  is—IT  is  one  tool  to  accomplish
that.

Ms.  KLOSS.  I  would  add  that  we  also  have  to  guard  against  any
failure  in  implementation.  That  is  these  implementations  need  to
go  very  well,  and  we  need  to  be  seeing  providers  really  benefiting
from  the  technologies,  and  so  the  work  that  you  have  done  on
workforce  development  is  key,  and  additional  insights  into  best
practices  and  workflow  improvements.  So  it  is  not  just  getting
them in. It is really making them work well and return.

Ms. WILLIAMS. And I would add that that is an ongoing process.
In  my  written  testimony,  we  did  outline  that  hospitals  with  more
advanced  IT  systems  than  what  physicians  currently  have  could
provide  help  in  both  hardware  and  software  implementation  and
ongoing  support.  But  we  can’t  do  so  today  because  the  physician-

referral  or  Stark  regulations.  Those  have  been  recently  relaxed  to
some extent. We would like to see the relaxation made permanent.
Dr. SILVERSTONE. My perspective is a little bit different, because
it  comes  from  the  trenches.  It  comes  from  the  physician’s  office.
And  I  have  talked  to  many,  many  physicians  over  the  years,  espe-
cially specialists, and they really want this technology.

They  can  see  that  at  its  best,  this  technology  can  really  help
them  to  provide  exceptional  care  to  patients  and  make  that  excep-
tional  care  the  norm.  But  there  is  a  tremendous  problem  with  the
cost,  and  there  is  a  tremendous  fear  with  the  cost.  And  physicians
are  small  businessmen.  Most  physicians  do  not  have  very,  very
close  ties  to  hospitals  and  don’t  want  those  ties.  They  want  to  re-
main  independent  business  concerns,  and  they  want  to  be  able  to
control  their  lives.  And  they  need  to  be  able  to  afford  it,  and  they
need  to  be  able  to  know,  going  into  the  future,  that  they  will  be
able to continue to afford the technology.

So  the  financial  aspects,  yes,  are  a  major  one,  and  the  financial
aspects  really  need  to  be  addressed.  Physicians  are  also  looking  at
what  it  takes  to  maintain  these  systems  in  their  offices,  and  as
soon  as  you  get  inter-operability,  as  soon  as  you  get  standards,  as
soon as you take your hundreds, and hundreds of sets of standards
and  get  an  organization  that  can  combine  them  and  can  take  the
best  of  all  of  the  sets  of  standards  and  really  make  them  routine,
then  you  are  producing  a  system  that  requires  less  maintenance
and  a  system  that  physicians’  offices  can  really  afford.  I  have  the
advantage  of  being  in  an  11-doctor  practice.  In  that  practice,  we
have a full-time HIT person, a full-time person to manage our net-
works and our systems, and most practices can’t afford that.

Mr.  BARNES.  I  would  like  to  follow  up  with  a  quick  comment

here.

Mr.  BAIRD.  It  is  going  to  have  to  be  real  quick,  because  I  have

a couple of other Members who want to——

Mr. BARNES. Well, just real quickly, I think that if I was a physi-
cian,  I  wouldn’t  think  about  not  investing  in  technology.  They  do
need  to  streamline  their  practices.  Most  of  my  customers,  which  I
have a very hands-on relationship with, do not have any HIT staff
in  their  office.  They  are  four-,  five-,  and  six-doctor  practices  across
America, and if you have the right system made for your specialty,
you  do  not  need—I  am  saying  that  if  they  do  their  due  diligence,
they will receive the benefits.

Mr. BAIRD. All right. Dr. Broun.
Mr. BROUN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am a physician. In fact,
I  am  a  primary  care  provider  and  I  have  done  a  full-time  house-
call  practice  the  last  few  years  just  prior  to  just  recently  being
elected  to  Congress.  When  I  was  in  an  office,  and  then  as  a  sole
practitioner,  I  looked  into  doing  electronic  medical  records  for  my
own patients, and what I found after doing a through investigation
is, frankly, I could not afford it. I don’t have Dr. Silverstone’s bless-
ing  of  having  a  large  practice  of  being  able  to  afford  a  full-time  IT
person,  and  so  I  think  affordability,  practicality  for  small,  commu-
nity practitioners—sometimes we have one, two or three doctors in
a  practice  who  want  to  be  independent,  who  is  not  tied  to  a  hos-
pital. It is a certainly a tremendous probe that we need to face, and
I  could  not  overcome  the  cost,  as  well  as  it  was  difficult  for  me  to

try to figure out how to go up the learning curve to be able to inte-
grate information technology into my own practice.

The  other  thing  is  our  local  hospital  in  Athens,  Georgia,  I  have
talked to the administrator recently, and they are trying to develop
an  IT  system  through  Athens  Regional  Hospital  where  all  of  the
doctor in the community are all tied into one computer system, and
I think that is a very laudable goal, but the thing that concerns me
is  privacy  and  confidentiality.  I  would,  in  my  own  practice,  all  of
my  employees  knew  that  if  anything  went  out  of  the  door  of  my
practice,  it  was  immediate  grounds  for  dismissal,  no  questions
asked. Fortunately, I never had to dismiss anybody.

But  last  year,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  an-
nounced that the theft of laptops contained information concerning,
I  think  it  is  26.5  million  veterans  and  active-duty  military  mem-
bers,  and  we  have  government  workers  losing  laptops  all  of  the
time  with  confidential,  even  top-secret  information,  on  those  com-
puters.  And  it  just  really  concerns  me  that  people  social  security
numbers, not only in these instances that I just mentioned, but as
a medical doctor, I am really concerned about the privacy of my pa-
tients and the confidentiality and when you set up this information
sharing,  I  see  a  very  real  potential  for  discrimination  against  par-
ents  for  insurability,  discrimination  in  hiring  practices,  and  these
types of things.

So  could  you  all  please  answer  to  me  how  we  can  ensure  that
confidentiality,  how  we  can  prevent  the  discrimination  to  my  pa-
tients in a new IT type of world.

Mr.  RAYMER.  I  will  take  that  to  start  with.  I  think  that  the  co-
nundrum  you  are  in  is  that  the  paper  record  is  also  not  very  se-
cure,  so  the  reality  that  is  if  you  walk  into  a  hospital  today,  and
it  has  got  a  lot  of  paper  charts,  there  is  ready  access  to  the  public
to that.

The majority of technology solutions that we are talking about is
not having the data stored in one location, but more of a federated
model  where  the  data  resides  back  in  the  practice,  and  the  indi-
vidual  practice  has  control  of  that,  and  that  you,  when  you  have
a patient referred into your practice, that you, with the appropriate
credentials,  have  the  ability  to  go  out  under  the  patient’s  HIPAA
concurrence  to  go  out  and  secure  other  relevant  data,  whether  it
be  problem  lists,  medication,  allergies,  which  are  all  important
things  that  you  would  like  to  know  about  a  patient  being  referred
into your practice.

So  we  do  believe  that  NIST  can  play  a  role,  particularly  in  the
security and privacy side. And my testimony talked about the need
for  role-based  security  and  how  critical  of  importance  that  will  be,
so you know, I think that it is certainly something that is internal-
ized,  but  it  is  very  personal,  so  that  one  thing  you  can  say  about
health care is it affects everyone in this room. And so I think that
in both the public and the private area GE is very concerned about
this  very  issue  as  you  look  to  the  future  of  genomics,  which  is  a
whole  other  universe  of  personal  medical  information  that,  you
know, could be accessed, so it is a big concern that we have.

Ms.  KLOSS.  I  would  add  that  the  Certification  Commission  for
Health  IT  in  the  foundational  testing  that  they  are  doing  for  all
certified  electronic  health  records  is  meeting  certain  privacy  and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:49 Feb 22, 2008 Jkt 037983 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL07\092607\37983 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

security  common  standards  and  that  those  are  being  ratcheted  up
over time as all of us learn to use systems with more robust certifi-
cation  and  privacy  controls.  So  I  think  that  is  one  of  the  step-wise
processes  in  the  standards  deployment  now.  What  we  have,  how-
ever, and what the e-Health—the State e-Health Alliance and other
groups  are  looking  at  is  the  wide  disparity  among  states  and  how,
in fact the current law is actually being put into place. We just do
have  more  need  for  education  across  the  board  and  practices.  It  is
not all technology standards.

Mr. BAIRD. Those buzzers you have been hearing means we have
a  vote  underway,  and  so  we  have  just  enough  time  for  Mr.  Akin
to ask a couple of questions, and then we will——

Mr. AKIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Actually, one of
the  questions  was  asked—I  was  just  curious  about  the,  you  know,
legal  problems,  but  in  terms  of  data  security,  is  that  something
that we have to change the laws, because we get pretty hyper-sen-
sitive  about  anybody,  you  know,  knowing  whether  you  had  a  101-
degree fever or something? I mean it wasn’t quite that bad, but we
really  go  pretty  hyper  about  his.  Do  we  have  to  change  the  laws
any in that regard, and is that a big problem?

Mr. BARNES. I will start with that one. I think that that is prob-
ably  being  scoped  right  now.  I  mean  I  sit  on  the  National  Gov-
ernor’s Association Privacy Board for that exact reason, and we are
looking  at  all  of  the  50  states’  privacy  laws  as  well  as  HIPAA  to
see  what  recommendations  that  we  will  made  to  all  50  states  and
to Congress on does HIPAA need to be modified? Does it just need
to be enforced? Better interpreter? Or what do we need to do across
state  lines?  I  mean  every  state  sees  consent  and  authorization  dif-
ferently,  and  so  we  are  trying  to  provide  guidance,  and  that  is  un-
derway, currently, right now. We meet every month to discuss this
and  should  have  some  further  recommendations  at  the  end  of  this
year, so I don’t know if there is a yes or no answer quite yet. There
might be by some panel——

Ms.  KLOSS.  There  is  a  gap,  and  that  is  the  gap  in  genetic  non-
discrimination  disclosure,  where  we  have  been  advocating  for  law
in that area, specifically to cover an area of vulnerability.

Mr.  AKIN.  You  do  need  some  additional  protection,  no  easing  off

on things that already exist?
Ms. KLOSS. That is correct.
Mr.  AKIN.  Are  there  places  where  we  need  to  ease  off  things

where we are too strict, or not necessarily?

Ms. KLOSS. I think we have always viewed HIPAA as a floor, and
that  a  floor,  over  time,  as  we  gain  more  experience  and  get  that
in place, we should look to, you know, raising the bar as technology
enable  things  like  robust  audit  trails  and  other  mechanisms  to
really  keep  raising  the  bar.  And  I  think  we  need  a  commitment  to
that over time.

Mr.  AKIN.  I  mean  I  was  thinking—what  I  am  talking  about  is
maybe  it  was  too  high.  I  remember  there  were  times  that  you
couldn’t  tell  the  dentist  that  the  patient  had  AIDS  or  something,
and  then  you  have  people  that  are—their  health  is  at  risk  and
things  like  that.  So  I  was  wondering  if  we  get—you  know,  if  there
was  a  balancing  act.  I  mean  it  seems  to  me  there  would  be  a  bal-
ancing act, not that you are always ratcheting something up.

Mr. BARNES. I think that adding interpretation also might be an
answer. It might be a regulatory guideline or regulatory interpreta-
tion,  maybe  not  on  the  legislative  side.  It’s  in  what  you  are  trying
to  uncover  because  HIPAA  is  just  misinterpreted,  and  so  unfortu-
nately,  people  interpret  it  as  conservatively  as  possibly  so  they
don’t  enter  any  hot  water,  so  I  think  that  is  what  we  are  still
ungoverned.

Mr.  AKIN.  And  then  the  second  thing,  is  there—I  used  to  work
for  IBM  and  the  magnitude  of  this  question  is  sort  of  mind  numb-
ing  to  me,  but  is  there  any  single  organization  now  that  can  do
some systems design and at least define some interfaces so that as
people  design  systems  that  the  things  can  plug  together  at  the—
or is this something that is still—but is there any one, single orga-
nization  that  is  trying  to  define  what  the  system  might  look  like?
Mr.  RAYMER.  Well,  certainly,  there  is  from  a  standards  stand-
point, a definition. No one is trying to write a standard that defines
one  system.  In  the  State  of  Vermont,  GE  happens  to  be  the  pro-
vider  of  the  regional  health  information  infrastructure  in  that  we
are  providing  a  product,  but  there  are  other  states  that  are  doing
something  similar.  We  are  all  leveraging  the  same  work  product
that is coming out of HITSP, so the standard shouldn’t define a de
facto  product  solution.  The  standard  should  define  what  a  product
should  look  like,  and  then  there  should  be  the  incentive,  commer-
cially, to develop a system that is responsive to those standards.

Mr. AKIN. So it is a two-tier thing. You have some standards, and
then  you  let  the  private  sector  work  those,  and  that  is  the  way
we—because  those  of  us  in  government  are  very  sensitive  to  the
fact  that,  you  know,  we  are  not  effective  as  business  in  terms  of
being  able  to  put  products  in  good  quality.  You  know,  at  the  same
time,  there  needs  to  be  some  kind  of  guidance,  and  so  is  that  bal-
anced?  You  think  that  this  bill  sets  that  balance  about  right  from
what you see?

Dr.  SILVERSTONE.  I  would  agree  with  that.  I  would  say  that  is
exactly  what  it  does  do:  it  provides  the  framework,  the  foundation
that enables the private sector to be able to come in and create the
programs and the systems that we need.

Mr. AKIN. And my hope is—of course, all of us can see the bene-
fits of it. I am a prostate cancer survivor, so you say you got to go
see—you  are  going  to  get  surgery  and  this  and  that,  and  if  those
statistics  are  really  recorded  well,  it  is  going  to  be  a  tremendous
tool, medically, to know all kinds of different things. But yes, I am
hoping  the  day  will  come  when  the  individual  practitioner—that
there  is  stuff  that  is  cheap  enough  off  the  shelf  and  that  it  is  not
too  complicated,  but  I  also  walk  into  a  room  with  computers,  and
they start laughing, so I am one of the guys that needs two IT peo-
ple. Thank you. We have got to go vote.

Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Akin, we are down to five minutes.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Submitted  to  David  E.  Silverstone,  Clinical  Professor  of  Ophthalmology  and  Visual
Science,  Yale  School  of  Medicine;  Assistant  Chief  of  Ophthalmology,  Yale-New
Haven  Hospital;  Practicing  Ophthalmologist,  The  Eye  Care  Group,  New  Haven,
CT

These questions were submitted to the witness, but were not responded to by the

time of publication.

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. What are the major factors that discourage medical specialist practices from in-
vesting  in  health  care  IT  (HIT)  systems?  To  what  extent  would  improved  inter-
operability with HIT systems at hospitals, labs, and other medical facilities give
medical specialty practices the confidence to make investments in HIT?

Q2. How could an inter-operable HIT system better enable practicing specialty physi-
cians  to  keep  up-to-date  on  the  latest  medical  treatments  and  diagnosis  proce-
dures?  How  do  specialty  physicians  currently  track  the  latest  advances  in  med-
ical information and the recommended best-practice treatments in their field?

Q3. How are the needs of specialty medical practitioners different from those of hos-
pitals  and  general-medicine  providers?  What  are  some  examples  of  these  needs,
and how can HIT standards be made flexible enough to accommodate the needs
of specialists?

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. I  understand  that  the  Administration  supported  establishment  of  a  health  IT
standards  harmonization  process  in  2006  through  the  Healthcare  Information
Technology  Standards  Panel  (HITSP)  which  has  made  considerable  progress
over the past two years in the development and harmonization of data and tech-
nical standards for inter-operable health information exchange. How do you see
this  bill  building  on  the  current  standards  harmonization  process  through  the
HITSP?

Q2. In August 2006, the President issued Executive Order 13410, which requires fed-
eral  agencies  to  utilize,  where  available,  health  information  technology  systems
and  products  that  meet  inter-operability  standards  recognized  by  the  Secretary
of  Health  and  Human  Services.  The  American  Health  Information  Community
(AHIC)  has  recommended  several  sets  of  standards  that  HITSP  has  developed
or  harmonized.  How  do  you  feel  this  bill  would  affect  that  process,  given  HHS’
expertise in health IT standards?

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Noel  Brown  Williams,  President,  Senior  Vice  President,  and  Chief  In-
formation Officer, Hospital Corporation of America Information Technology and
Services, Inc.

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. You  have  suggested  the  problem  with  adoption  of  health  care  IT  (HIT)  is  that
the  industry  has  not  yet  selected  a  single  set  of  inter-operability  standards  and
gotten  consensus  among  health  care  stakeholders  to  use  those  standards.  Given
NIST’s long history of acting as a neutral government body working with indus-
try  and  other  groups  to  select  consensus  technical  standards  in  a  broad  array
of technical fields, isn’t NIST well positioned to guide this very necessary stand-
ards-selection and standards-buy-in process?

A1. The  short  answer  is  yes.  NIST  is  well  positioned  to  play  an  important  role  in
the  standards  selection  and  buy-in  process.  The  lack  of  a  single  set  of  inter-oper-
ability  standards  is  just  one  reason  for  the  slow  adoption  of  HIT.  While  the  best
standards  are  created  through  a  consensus  process,  there  must  be  commitment  on
the  part  of  stakeholders  to  make  the  necessary  investments  to  implement  those
standards. Commitment to implementation involves vendors, providers, laboratories
and a broad array of stakeholders with a legitimate need to share health data. NIST
could  make  a  valuable  contribution  to  this  piece  of  implementation.  Other  compo-
nents  of  the  commitment  process  include  initial  financing,  maintenance  costs,  pay-
ment  and  privacy  policies,  as  well  as  quality  reporting  and  other  issues  we  believe
are best resolved by other efforts and agencies already in place.
Q2. You  cite  as  one  example  of  the  lack  of  HIT  standards  the  fact  that  there  is  no
standardized  method  to  associate  a  patient  with  his  or  her  medical  records.
What is the consequence of this lack of HIT standards, and what does it prevent
health care providers from being able to do for patient care?

A2. The  lack  of  a  standardized  method  to  match  a  patient  with  his  or  her  medical
record is a fundamental problem that must be resolved before we can attain the vi-
sion  of  an  interconnected,  nationwide  health  information  network.  A  provider  can
never  be  100  percent  certain  that  the  record  under  review  belongs  to  the  right  pa-
tient  without  such  measures  in  place.  Both  false  negatives  and  positives  have  con-
sequences and could affect patient safety, as well as expose the physician to liability
if the wrong information is used during an episode of care.
Q3. How  would  a  fully  inter-operable  HIT  system  within  the  Federal  Government

advance the adoption of HIT in the private sector?

A3. A  fully  inter-operable  federal  HIT  system  would  advance  the  adoption  of  HIT
in  the  private  sector  by  demonstrating,  once  in  place,  that  inter-operability  reduces
costs,  improves  patient  safety  and  the  efficiency  of  the  care  process.  Furthermore,
a  government  system  could  be  used  to  pressure  the  private  sector  into  compliance
with  its  system  in  order  to  expedite  payments  and  claims  handled  by  the  Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

nical standards for inter-operable health information exchange. How do you see
this  bill  building  on  the  current  standards  harmonization  process  through  the
HITSP?

A1. This  bill  builds  upon  the  progress  already  made  by  HITSP  by  adding  NIST’s
expertise to transform the result of HITSP’s consensus-based decision-making proc-
ess  into  a  set  of  tools  and  guidelines  that  would  enable  the  implementation  of  the
decisions made. HITSP’s expertise is in guiding stakeholders to consensus on which
standards should be used; NIST takes it to the next logical step of implementation.

or  harmonized.  How  do  you  feel  this  bill  would  affect  that  process,  given  HHS’
expertise in health IT standards?

A2. Given the uncertain future of AHIC and its role in this process, this bill would
allow  NIST,  HITSP,  AHIC  and  HHS  to  identify  where  NIST’s  expertise  could  best
be leveraged We believe NIST could, if positioned correctly, complement rather than
constrain progress.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Linda  L.  Kloss,  Chief  Executive  Officer,  American  Health  Information

Management Association, Chicago, IL

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. You noted AHIMA’s support for the approach in H.R. 2406 of having NIST work
on security standards for health care IT (HIT). How important is robust security
and  confidentiality  of  medical  information  for  the  broad  public  acceptance  of
HIT systems? How can it best be achieved?

A1. AHIMA members, health information management (HIM) professionals, believe
that for public acceptance of HIT and electronic health information exchange (HIE)
there  must  be  trust  that  the  electronic  systems  and  manual  practices  involved  in-
clude the necessary functions or steps taken to secure their personal health informa-
tion  (PHI)  and  maintain  confidentiality  subscribed  to  in  the  agreements  between
consumers  and  entities  that  hold  or  transfer  PHI.  In  addition  to  a  number  of  con-
fidentiality practices and physical security, ‘‘security’’ includes a number of software
elements including, but not limited to, identification and authentication, access con-
trols, system audits and access tracking, data integrity, and so forth.

Security  is  not  a  new  issue  in  the  exchange  of  health  information.  HIM  profes-
sionals have made this a key element of our practice for decades, but when it comes
to  having  acceptable  standard  security  software  systems;  the  health  care  industry
has remained behind other industries. Development of functional security standards
have  been  an  important  activity  of  NIST,  and  AHIMA  believes  the  resources  of
NIST  in  combination  with  health  care  industry  oversight  must  be  brought  together
so  that  the  industry  can  have  available  the  security  tools  and  resources  necessary
to  combine  with  conscientious  confidentiality  practices  in  order  to  ensure  the
public’s trust in our collection, storage, and transfer of their PHI.

Although  not  under  the  jurisdiction  of  NIST,  AHIMA  believes  that  penalties  are
an essential element of robust confidentiality requirements and building broad pub-
lic  acceptance  of  HIT  systems.  Penalties  need  to  be  severe  and  should  encompass
security  and  confidentiality  breaches  along  with  non-compliance  with  laws,  regula-
tions  and  standards.  The  HIPAA  Privacy  Rule  has  now  been  in  effect  since  April
14,  2003  (April  14,  2004  for  small  health  plans)  and  non-compliance,  at  this  stage,
is inexcusable.
Q2. What  are  the  research  and  development  needs  to  ensure  that  advances  in  infor-
mation  technology  and  medical  technology  can  be  incorporated  into  HIT  stand-
ards in the future?

A2. Standards  must  be  chosen  that  meet  the  current  functional  needs  and  can  be
harmonized  with  other  standard  that  also  must  support  a  particular  functional
model. This means that the bodies harmonizing standards must review not only the
potential transaction, terminology, or classification standard(s) involved, but also en-
sure that the body that develops and maintains the standard and subscribes to prin-
ciples such as:

• Transparent  and  open  business  practices  by  all  participating  organizations—
this  includes  end  users  of  the  standard  or  the  data  included  or  represented
by the standard,
• Organization, mechanisms, and a timely process necessary to keep standards
robust and up-to-date with current medical practices and technology (national
and  international).  Section  201  of  H.R.  4157,  the  ‘‘Health  Information  Tech-
nology  Promotion  Act’’  in  the  109th  Congress,  provided  good  language  to  re-
duce the time and streamline the process to modify and update HIPAA stand-
ards,
• Standard  development  principles  and  guidelines  for  development,  distribu-
• The provision of timely and reliable guidance on the use of the standard (also

tion, and maintenance of systems and coordination across systems,

a role for any coordinating body).

Q3. In  your  testimony  you  noted  that  there  are  over  2,000  standards  related  to  HIT
and  over  400  organizations  that  either  create,  maintain,  or  license  those  stand-
ards.  If  the  most  important  job  in  making  HIT  a  reality  is  to  work  towards  a
single  set  of  standards  and  get  consensus  on  using  that  set  of  standards,  isn’t
the leadership of a neutral government body such as NIST, with its long history
of  working  with  the  private  sector  on  consensus  standards  development,  essen-
tial?

A3. The  numbers  in  your  question  were  not  part  of  AHIMA’s  testimony.  Even  so,
there  are  many  standards  and  many  organizations.  Yet,  the  issue  of  choosing  or
harmonizing  standards  remains.  The  active  involvement  of  a  skilled  neutral  group,
such as NIST, will do much to accelerate the harmonization process, but there also
has  to  be  consensus  and  buy-in  from  the  health  care  industry,  which  is  currently
operating on a public-private model—the Health Information Technology Standards
Panel (HITSP) and the American Health Information Community (AHIC). Were the
health  care  industry  not  so  invested  in  this  model,  the  NIST  leadership  role  you
suggest  might  be  an  acceptable  alternative.  However,  the  current  Administration
has  pushed  for  a  public/private  model  and  the  industry  has  invested  considerable
resources and time to make this approach work. We appreciate the Committee’s ac-
ceptance  of  the  roles  of  HITSP  and  CCHIT  and  working  NIST  into  the  current
model  will  to  help  accelerate  the  harmonization  process,  support  security  standard
development, and provide the needed testing mechanisms.
Q4. What  would  be  the  benefits  to  public  health,  in  terms  of  tracking  disease  out-
break,  adverse  drug  reactions,  or  other  issues,  from  a  fully  inter-operable  HIT
system?

A4. Presuming  the  health  care  industry  can  arrive  at  uniform  and  consistent  use
of terminologies and classifications in electronic health records (EHRs); address con-
fidentiality concerns through the use of good security standards, compliance and en-
forcement;  establish  the  network  and  decision  support  necessary  to  determine  re-
porting  paths;  and,  use  the  same  network  to  provide  public  health  notices  and
guidelines, then the benefits of collecting data for population health purposes (public
health,  research,  and  similar  reporting)  are  expected  to  be  enormous.  Currently,
none of these activities and reporting mechanisms (networks) are in place. Most re-
porting  is  done  by  hand,  systems  operate  in  silos,  and  the  classification  systems  in
use are mapped in few systems, but not capable of reporting, in any detail, 21st cen-
tury diseases or medical practices and technology. Moreover, because of our nation’s
inconsistent use of uniform and consistent terminologies, we are unable to efficiently
exchange information with most of the international community including the World
Health  Organization  and  its  Global  Outbreak  Alert  and  Response  Network.  This  is
severely detrimental to our ability to track the progress of outbreaks of diseases as
avian influenza, SARS and potential bioterrorism events.

Substantial efforts are underway to achieve this vision for population health. The
Science  and  Technology  Committee’s  attention  to  the  terminology  and  classification
standards  coordination  and  improvements  needed  as  well  as  the  harmonization  of
transaction,  functional,  and  security  standards  will  give  this  movement  a  consider-
able boost.
Q5. How  could  an  inter-operable  HIT  system  better  enable  practicing  physicians  to
keep up-to-date on the latest medical treatments and diagnosis procedures? How
could  inter-operable  HIT  systems  support  decision-making  by  practicing  physi-
cians and other health care providers?

A5. AHIMA  would  interpret  ‘‘inter-operable’’  in  this  question  to  mean  uniform  and
consistent  use  of  contemporary  medical  terminologies  and  classifications  as  well  as
the adoption of a standard EHR and networked health information exchange (HIE).
If  the  medical  community  is  capable  of  reporting  findings  and  questions  in  the
same uniform and consistent language, then a variety of public and private organi-
zations, including the CDC, AHRQ, NIH, NLM, and various private foundations and
medical  research  organizations,  can  respond  with  what  is  known  regarding  a  par-
ticular disease or problem and provide guidelines for how to respond.

Currently, the language of medicine in the U.S. is not consistent or uniform which
limits  communication  both  to  asking  the  question  as  well  as  providing  an  answer.
The ability to use either uniform terminologies to exchange the actual health record,
or classifications to identify diagnoses, procedures, and technology, must be detailed,
and the ability to transmit such information uniformly then permits the use of com-
puter technology to scan information and provide links to potential responses or ex-
perts. Today, most communication is visual and the data is limited, therefore reduc-
ing  the  ability  and  increasing  the  time  to  search  the  vast  body  of  knowledge  avail-
able.  Time  is  a  very  important  factor  with  physicians,  both  in  the  time  they  have
available and the timely needs for information as they are treating individuals and
reporting key information for population health purposes, research and so on.
Q6. To  encourage  the  rapid  adoption  of  HIT  systems  by  health  care  providers,  it  is
important to guard against failures of implementation, which would reduce con-
fidence in the benefits of HIT systems and make other providers reluctant to in-
vest in them. How will technical test beds for testing HIT products help prevent

77

implementation failures? What other actions can reduce the risk of implementa-
tion failures?

A6. The  technical  test  beds  discussed  in  AHIMA’s  testimony  were  recommended  to
allow for certification of HIT products to ensure the purchaser that the product: in-
cluded  applicable,  adopted  (HITSP/AHIC)  standards;  provided  the  capability  for
inter-operability;  and  possessed  the  capability  to  be  upgraded  as  the  industry  up-
grades its standards, systems and system requirements, and so forth.

HIT vendors must have their own test beds to ensure their products meet the in-
dustry and customer demands, and some of this testing could use the same technical
test beds suggested for development by NIST and harmonization by HITSP. Vendors
must  also  be  able  to  test  their  product  against  any  networking  or  HIE  that  exists
in the purchasers environment.

Implementation,  however,  is  more  than  buying  a  good,  a  certified  HIT  product,
that has the capacity to use uniform contemporary terminologies and classifications.
Implementation  requires  careful  planning,  work  flow  and  other  administrative
changes, new ways of doing business for the clinicians, patients, and the other pro-
fessionals and administrative persons involved, and on-going maintenance and edu-
cation  after  implementation  has  occurred.  If  successful  implementation  of  a  stand-
ard  EHR  and  HIE  is  going  to  be  accomplished  across  this  country,  a  workforce  of
educated and trained health information management and informatics professionals
must  be  present  and  available  to  the  organizations,  physician  practices,  and  other
entities  involved  with  implementing  these  systems  et  al.  The  Science  and  Tech-
nology  Committee  took  significant  steps  to  address  this  need  in  passing  H.R.  1467,
and we hope that the Senate will soon pass complementary legislation.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Michael Raymer, Vice President and General Manager, Global Product

Strategy, GE Healthcare Integrated IT Solutions

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. How  should  NIST  interact  with  the  Healthcare  Information  Technology  Stand-
ards Panel (HITSP), and in what ways would that interaction further the rapid
adoption of consensus technical standards for health care IT (HIT)?

A1. Interaction  between  NIST  and  HITSP  is  already  occurring.  Two  areas  that
could enhance this interaction to accelerate adoption of standards are:

1. Utilize  NIST’s  experience  in  security  standards  technology,  e.g.,  role  based

access controls.

2. Leverage  NIST  to  enforce  the  harmonization  of  a  single  set  of  test  tools  it
has championed through its private sector collaboration with Integrating the
Healthcare  Enterprise  (IHE).  NIST  has  already  played  a  key  role  in  pro-
viding test tools/methodologies to test conformance of HITSP standards.

Q2. How  would  a  fully  inter-operable  HIT  system  within  the  Federal  Government

advance the adoption of HIT in the private sector?

A2. A  fully  inter-operable  HIT  system  within  the  Federal  Government  would  be  a
positive step forward if it would encourage further adoption of the HITSP specifica-
tions. This is important because it helps drive harmonization of standards through-
out  all  of  health  care  (public  and  private)  and  it  would  ensure  the  positive  momen-
tum that HITSP has encouraged the last two years. Additionally, use of the HITSP
specifications would enable improved inter-operability between the VA and the DOD
HIT systems.
Q3. American  patients  are  very  concerned  that  HIT  systems  must  protect  the  con-
fidentiality of their personal medical information. How has NIST contributed to
the  security  of  HIT  systems  to  date,  and  what  further  contributions  could  it
make to ensuring patient confidentiality?

A3. As we noted in our testimony, NIST is widely recognized for its expertise in se-
curity  standards,  most  notably  role-based  access  control  standards  and  associated
policy  and  processes  for  its  implementation.  This  technology  has  been  widely  used
in just about every economic sector, and NIST has helped champion its usage in the
health care sector. In addition, NIST championed the development of the infrastruc-
ture standards identified by HITSP to enable secure exchange of health information
in  the  Nationwide  Health  Information  Network.  NIST’s  collaborative  involvement
with  IHE  in  developing  these  health  information  exchange  standards  has  acceler-
ated  the  ability  to  securely  exchange  health  information  not  only  in  the  U.S.,  but
in  health  information  exchange  projects  globally.  The  global  use  of  these  standards
helps  enable  commerce  and  national  security  by  promoting  common  standards  to
support  clinical  research  and  enable  health  information  sharing  for  pandemic  sur-
veillance.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. I  understand  that  the  Administration  supported  establishment  of  a  health  IT
standards  harmonization  process  in  2006  through  the  Healthcare  Information
Technology  Standards  Panel  (HITSP)  which  has  made  considerable  progress
over the past two years in the development and harmonization of data and tech-
nical standards for inter-operable health information exchange. How do you see
this  bill  building  on  the  current  standards  harmonization  process  through  the
HITSP?

A1. The bill would allow NIST to help existing collaborative efforts by using its sub-
ject  matter  expertise  in  areas  such  as  testing  and  security  standards  development
to accelerate the implementation of HIT standards in the private sector. It is critical
to  ensure  that  NIST  support  the  positive  momentum  of  multi-stakeholder  efforts
such  as  HITSP.  Lending  its  expertise  in  the  promulgation  of  security  standards,
working collaboratively with HITSP, would be a positive step.
Q2. In August 2006, the President issued Executive Order 13410, which requires fed-
eral  agencies  to  utilize,  where  available,  health  information  technology  systems
and  products  that  meet  inter-operability  standards  recognized  by  the  Secretary

of  Health  and  Human  Services.  The  American  Health  Information  Community
(AHIC)  has  recommended  several  sets  of  standards  that  HITSP  has  developed
or  harmonized.  How  do  you  feel  this  bill  would  affect  that  process,  given  HHS’
expertise in health IT standards?

A2. For  clarification,  AHIC  does  not  and  did  not  recommend  standards.  Rather,
AHIC provided areas of health care delivery that could be greatly improved through
the use of HIT. Once these delivery scenarios (i.e., use-cases) were identified, HITSP
then  identified  the  standards  necessary  for  HIT  systems  to  enable  these  new  ‘‘use-
cases.’’ NIST does not have the expertise to determine what use-cases would impact
U.S. health care. Nor does NIST have expertise in the health care-specific standards
needed,  including  vocabulary  and  terminology  standards.  Therefore,  the  bill  would
not  and  should  not  affect  those  areas  relating  to  health  care  delivery  use-case
prioritization  or  the  health  care  specific  standards  related  to  their  implementation.
However, there are specific areas, such as security standards, information exchange
infrastructure standards, and related testing tools/resource expertise that NIST pro-
vides.  NIST  also  provides  a  culture  of  collaboration  with  the  private  sector  that
would benefit the health care sector.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Justin T. Barnes, Vice President of Marketing, Corporate Development

and Government Affairs, Greenway Medical Technologies, Inc.

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. How are the economic incentives for investment in health care IT (HIT) systems

different for small versus large health care providers?

A1. Economic incentives tend to be more valuable for smaller physician group prac-
tices  than  larger  physician  group  practices.  The  relative  cost  of  HIT  adoption  is
greater  for  a  small  practice  because  the  costs  are  not  shared  by  as  many  providers
and  stakeholders.  In  larger  physician  group  practices,  the  cost  of  HIT  adoption  is
usually  shared  over  a  greater  number  of  providers  and  stakeholders,  thus  the  ‘‘per
provider’’ cost is lower.
Q2. Can small practitioners expect a financial return on their investment in HIT sys-

tems in the same timeframe as large hospitals and large practices?

A2. For  the  most  part,  yes.  Smaller  physician  practices  can  expect  a  return  on  in-
vestment  (ROI)  from  their  HIT  implementation  in  similar  timeframes  as  larger
practices. It may take an extra few months for smaller practices but in overall, both
groups realize the ROI benefits 6–12 months after implementation. Sometimes even
sooner  if  the  practice  thoroughly  researched  products  and  purchased  an  integrated
and  inter-operable  electronic  health  record  (EHR)  that  was  proven  to  perform  well
in their specialty. This is a very, very important factor in recognizing ROI from HIT
and EHRs.
Q3. How  could  an  inter-operable  HIT  system  better  enable  practicing  physicians  to

keep up-to-date on the latest medical treatments and diagnosis procedures?

A3. Many  of  the  leading  HIT  and  EHR  solutions  today  automatically  receive  reg-
ular  updates  electronically  that  keep  treatments,  protocols,  procedures  and  coding
updated. These updates are automatically integrated seamlessly into HIT and EHR
work  flows  and  are  added  monthly,  quarterly,  semi-annually  or  annually  based  on
practice preferences.
Q4. How  could  inter-operable  HIT  systems  support  decision-making  by  practicing

physicians and other health care providers?

A4. Many  of  the  leading  HIT  and  EHR  solutions  today  have  financial  and  clinical
decision support tools and modules integrated into their functionality. Practices, col-
leagues, peers and medical associations can all share treatment protocols, best prac-
tices  and  much  more  to  increase  care  quality  through  the  utilization  of  inter-oper-
able HIT and EHRs.
Q5. How  would  a  fully  inter-operable  HIT  system  within  the  Federal  Government

advance the adoption of HIT in the private sector?

A5. Not  sure  it  would  unless  it  was  referenced  as  an  example  or  ‘‘best  practice’’  on
increasing  care  quality,  saving  lives  and  decreasing  costs.  If  those  were  shown  to
be proven factors of a Federal Government HIT system, then it should lead the pri-
vate  sector  to  adopt  and  implement  a  fully  inter-operable  HIT  system  to  ascertain
those  same  results.  I  feel  the  issue  here  is  that  the  Federal  Government  does  not
operate  in  a  similar  manner  to  the  private  sector  so  many  do  not  compare  or  cor-
relate results and experiences.
Q6. Could  you  provide  us  with  some  examples  of  the  drawbacks  of  a  lack  of  coordi-
nation  of  technical  standards  in  the  realm  of  conformance-testing  for  HIT  sys-
tems?

A6. The  drawbacks  would  be  significant  certainly  in  the  areas  of  time,  lives  and
money.  Coordination  of  these  efforts  will  get  inter-operability  promulgated  much
more  quickly  and  therefore  we  begin  increasing  care  quality,  saving  lives  and  de-
creasing  health  care  costs  more  rapidly.  If  there  is  a  lack  of  coordination,  it  would
add on several more years to achieve full health care industry inter-operability and
therefore  unnecessarily  reducing  care  quality,  losing  more  lives  to  medical  errors
and increasing wasteful spending on duplicative measures.

Technology  Standards  Panel  (HITSP)  which  has  made  considerable  progress
over the past two years in the development and harmonization of data and tech-
nical standards for inter-operable health information exchange. How do you see
this  bill  building  on  the  current  standards  harmonization  process  through  the
HITSP?

A1. This bill authorizes NIST, whose primary mission is to promote U.S. innovation
and  industrial  competitiveness  by  advancing  measurement  science,  standards,  and
technology  in  ways  that  enhance  economic  security  and  improve  our  quality  of  life,
to  increase  its  efforts  in  support  of  the  integration  of  the  health  care  information
enterprise in the United States. NIST has a successful history of collaboration with
Health  Information  Technology  Standards  Panel  (HITSP)  and  Integrating  the
Healthcare  Enterprise  (IHE)  and  that  role  should  be  maintained.  This  bill  further
encourages this collaboration to make these initiatives even more effective, efficient
and comprehensive.
Q2. In August 2006, the President issued Executive Order 13410, which requires fed-
eral  agencies  to  utilize,  where  available,  health  information  technology  systems
and  products  that  meet  inter-operability  standards  recognized  by  the  Secretary
of  Health  and  Human  Services.  The  American  Health  Information  Community
(AHIC)  has  recommended  several  sets  of  standards  that  HITSP  has  developed
or  harmonized.  How  do  you  feel  this  bill  would  affect  that  process,  given  HHS’
expertise in health IT standards?

A2. This bill could negatively affect HITSP progress if NIST was authorized to lead
any  health  care  standards-creating,  setting  or  harmonizing  processes.  Additionally,
if  this  bill  authorized  the  creation  of  any  alternative  health  care  standards  outside
of the HITSP process, that would be confusing and distracting to our current indus-
try  progress.  It  is  best  that  NIST  plays  a  supporting  role  in  health  care  standards
and continues their important collaboration with HITSP.

STATEMENT OF GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL

ON BEHALF OF THE MID-NEBRASKA TELEMEDICINE NETWORK

Rural Telehealth Success Story: Mid-Nebraska Telemedicine

Network

PROVIDED BY LESLEY A. BOLLWITT-MARIA, MPA

DIRECTOR, GRANTS & SPECIAL PROJECTS
GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL FOUNDATION

KEARNEY, NEBRASKA

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to
provide testimony in support of the use of health information technology to enhance
access to health care services.

My  name  is  Lesley  A.  Bollwitt-Maria,  and  I  am  Director  of  Grants  &  Special
Projects  with  Good  Samaritan  Hospital  in  Kearney,  Nebraska.  One  of  my  primary
objectives  over  the  last  seven  years  has  been  to  assist  with  the  expansion  and  en-
hancement  of  the  services  provided  through  Good  Samaritan’s  Mid-Nebraska  Tele-
medicine Network.
Organizational Description

Good  Samaritan  Hospital  (GSH)  located  in  Kearney,  Nebraska  is  a  not-for-profit,
501  (c)  3,  health  care  system  affiliated  with  Catholic  Health  Initiatives  of  Denver,
Colorado,  a  faith-based  organization.  Good  Samaritan,  a  U.S.  Designated  Regional
Referral  Center,  is  a  two-hospital  system  serving  approximately  350,000  people
throughout central and western Nebraska, northern Kansas and northwestern Colo-
rado.  The  overall  service  area  encompasses  a  region  approximately  the  size  of  the
State of Indiana. Good Samaritan is one of only three American College of Surgeons
accredited Level II Trauma Centers in Nebraska.

Good  Samaritan  serves  as  the  hub  facility  for  a  thirteen  member  Critical  Access
Hospital  Network  and  for  the  Mid-Nebraska  Telemedicine  Network,  a  Telehealth
network including twenty-two rural hospitals located in both Kansas and Nebraska.
Good Samaritan Hospital is also one of the founding members of the Nebraska Tele-
health  Network,  a  project  connecting  every  hospital  and  public  health  department
in the State of Nebraska for telehealth services.

Members  of  the  Sisters  of  St.  Francis  of  Colorado  Springs  established  Good  Sa-
maritan  Hospital  in  1924.  Now  licensed  for  207  beds,  Good  Samaritan  Hospital
(GSH) is the largest regional referral center between Lincoln, Nebraska and Denver,
Colorado.  In  addition,  in  1987  Good  Samaritan  purchased  Richard  Young  Hospital,
an  80-bed  behavioral  health  hospital  also  located  in  Kearney  that  provides  care  for
children, adolescents and adults. Established in 1981, the Good Samaritan Hospital
Foundation directs all fund-raising activities for the health system.

The  Mission  of  Good  Samaritan  and  Catholic  Health  Initiatives  is  to  nurture  the
healing  ministry  of  the  Church  by  bringing  it  new  life,  energy  and  viability  in  the
21st century. Fidelity to the Gospel urges us to emphasize human dignity and social
justice as we move toward the creation of healthier communities.
Defining the Problem: Increasing Access to Health Care

Rural  communities  across  the  State  of  Nebraska  are  faced  with  the  challenge  of
providing  access  for  all  citizens  to  quality  health  care  services.  Numerous  barriers
exist  which  make  this  challenge  even  more  daunting.  These  barriers  often  include:
distance to specialty health care services, hazardous driving conditions due to harsh
Nebraska  winter  weather,  lack  of  a  state-wide  public  transportation  system,  in-
creased  poverty  for  rural  citizens  resulting  from  the  struggling  farm  economy,  the
increasing  age  of  patients  and  the  crisis  level  shortage  of  health  care  professions.
According to the Nebraska Rural Health Plan for the Critical Access Hospital Pro-
gram (2002), the rural health care system exists in a fragile environment. Rural Ne-
braska faces many challenges, including a loss of population in some areas, a grow-
ing  number  of  uninsured  and  under-insured,  and  an  increase  in  the  Medicare  and
Medicaid  populations.  Given  the  lack  of  employment  opportunities  and  the  rising
cost of health care these trends are likely to worsen over the next few years.

Additionally,  the  report  indicated  that  about  19  percent  of  the  state’s  population
must  travel  for  thirty  minutes  or  more  to  visit  a  doctor.  In  rural  areas,  this  travel
time  significantly  increases  when  that  doctor  needed  becomes  a  specialist.  The  dis-
tance of the rural communities from a tertiary care center can represent travel time
of one to three hours one way. Travel also becomes more difficult as the populations
of  these  rural  communities  age.  The  total  percent  of  individuals  over  the  age  of  65

85

for  the  state  averages  13.6  percent;  however,  in  the  rural  areas,  like  central  Ne-
braska,  this  percentage  jumps  to  21  percent.  In  most  cases,  a  family  member  must
accompany  an  elderly  individual  to  their  doctor’s  appointment  in  a  larger  commu-
nity  like  Omaha,  resulting  in  missed  time  away  from  work  and  family.  This  travel
time becomes increasingly more difficult when the weather is bad.
Improving Health Care Access Through Technology

The use of technology to improve access to health care services in Nebraska is not
new. Actually, Nebraska has the distinction of introducing the world to the concept
of using video-conferencing for clinical applications. Leaders in the field of telemedi-
cine/telehealth  suggest  that  the  current  state  of  technology  is  moving  from  its  sec-
ond  generation  into  its  third.  The  ‘‘first  generation’’  can  be  traced  as  far  back  as
the  1950s.  One  of  the  earliest  uses  was  at  the  University  of  Nebraska  where  psy-
chiatric consultations were conducted on two-way closed circuit TV using microwave
technologies.

Established  in  1994,  the  Mid-Nebraska  Telemedicine  Network  is  an  interactive
video and data network. The major functions of the Network are to improve quality
and  access  to  care,  particularly  in  rural  Nebraska  and  Kansas,  to  provide  patient,
provider and community education and to provide another communication source in
the event of a natural, man-made or terrorist emergency.

The  Mid-Nebraska  Telemedicine  Network  has  the  distinction  of  being  one  of  the
longest  federally  funded  telehealth  networks  in  the  county  with  funding  beginning
in  1994  and  continuing  through  today.  The  network  was  just  awarded  its  third
USDA/RUS DLT grant so funding will continue beyond 2007. Funding has been re-
ceived  through  the  Office  of  Rural  Health  Policy,  Office  for  the  Advancement  of
Telehealth  (OAT)  and  the  USDA/RUS  DLT  grant  programs.  These  federal  dollars
have been put to successful use in improving access to health care services in rural
areas,  like  Nebraska  and  Kansas.  Since  becoming  fully  functioning  in  December
1995, the network has totaled over 11,000 Patient Encounters, 30,000 Teleradiology,
and 3,000 Educational Programs.
Statement of Experience

The  Mid-Nebraska  Telemedicine  Network  (MNTN)  became  operational  in  Decem-
ber  1995  as  a  result  of  a  start-up  grant  through  the  Office  of  Rural  Health  Policy.
The  network  included  the  hub  site  of  Good  Samaritan  Hospital  (Kearney)  and  five
rural  network  members  consisting  of  Tri-Valley  Hospital  (Cambridge),  Cozad  Com-
munity Hospital (Cozad), Callaway District Hospital (Callaway), Jennie M. Melham
Memorial  Medical  Center  (Broken  Bow)  and  the  Sargent  Hospital  (Sargent),  Ne-
braska.

In  October  1997,  the  Good  Samaritan  Hospital  Foundation  received  a  second
grant  through  the  Office  of  Rural  Health  Policy.  Through  this  second  grant  award,
the  MNTN  expanded  its  services  to  include  five  additional  rural  hospitals  located
in  Rock  County  Hospital  (Bassett),  Dundy  County  Hospital  (Benkelman),  Valley
County  Hospital  (Ord),  Phillips  County  Hospital  (Phillipsburg,  KS),  Norton  County
Hospital (Norton, KS). In 1999 the Sargent District Hospital closed and Gothenburg
Memorial Hospital (Gothenburg) took its place.

In August 2000, the Office of Rural Health Policy awarded a third grant. Through
this  third  grant,  the  Mid-Nebraska  Telemedicine  Network  expanded  its  services  to
include  the  two  additional  rural  hospitals  of  Franklin  County  Memorial  Hospital
(Franklin) and the Chase County Hospital (Imperial).

In September 2004, the Good Samaritan Hospital Foundation received notification
that the MNTN was awarded a congressionally mandated grant. Through this fund-
ing,  six  additional  sites  were  added  to  the  network.  These  sites  included:  Kearney
County  Community  Hospital  (Minden),  Webster  County  Hospital  (Red  Cloud),  St.
Anthony’s Hospital (O’Neill), Jewell County Hospital (Mankato, KS), Brown County
Hospital (Ainsworth, Nebraska) and the Smith County Community Hospital (Smith
Center, KS).

In  September  2005,  the  Good  Samaritan  Hospital  Foundation  was  awarded  the
program’s  second  congressionally  mandated  grant.  Through  this  funding,  two  addi-
tional sites were added to the network. These sites included: Harlan County Health
Systems (Alma, Nebraska) and Tri-County Hospital (Lexington, Nebraska).

The  Mid-Nebraska  Telemedicine  Network  has  also  been  a  recipient  of  funding
through  the  USDA–RUS  Distance  Learning  and  Telemedicine  grant  program  in
2004,  2006  and  2007.  Through  the  2006  USDA–RUS  DLT  grant,  two  additional
rural  hospitals  were  added  to  the  network:  Community  Hospital  (McCook,  Ne-
braska) and Phelps Memorial Health Center (Holdrege, Nebraska).

As  of  2007,  the  Mid-Nebraska  Telemedicine  Network  includes  one  hub  site
(Kearney),  which  includes  additional  site  capabilities  in  the  education  department,

telemedicine  room,  emergency  room,  Family  Advocacy  Network  and  at  the  Richard
Young  Hospital  campus,  and  twenty-two  rural  remote  sites  in  both  Nebraska  and
Kansas.  Of  the  MNTN  members,  eighteen  of  the  nineteen  Nebraska  members  are
certified as Nebraska Critical Access Hospitals (CAH). The only non-CAH facility is
the hub/end-user site of Good Samaritan Hospital.

The  mission  of  the  Mid-Nebraska  Telemedicine  Network  is  to  use  technology  to
improve access to quality care by providing consultation and treatment in both rou-
tine  and  emergency  situations,  to  increase  health-related  educational  opportunities
for providers and the community, and to provide a venue for health-related adminis-
trative meetings.
System Uses: The Mid-Nebraska Telemedicine Network provides for a wide variety
of uses, including:

such as cardiology;

In  addition,  the  Nebraska  members  of  the  Mid-Nebraska  Telemedicine  Network
are  also  connected  into  the  Nebraska  Telehealth  Network,  which  helps  to  promote
the  long-term  project  sustainability.  Good  Samaritan,  as  a  leader  in  Telehealth  ac-
tivities in Nebraska, has served as the catalyst for the development of the statewide
Telehealth  network.  The  Nebraska  Telehealth  Network  is  an  interactive  video  and

data  network  that  provides  integration  among  the  hospitals,  public  health  depart-
ments,  public  health  laboratories  and  other  entities  across  the  entire  State  of  Ne-
braska.  The  major  functions  of  the  Network  are  to  improve  quality  and  access  to
care,  particularly  in  rural  Nebraska,  to  provide  patient,  provider  and  community
education  and  to  provide  another  communication  source  in  the  event  of  a  natural,
man-made or terrorist emergency.
Advantages of Telehealth

The  Mid-Nebraska  Telemedicine  Network  provides  value  to  the  network’s  users

in a number of ways, including the following:

1) The  Network  improves  the  access  of  the  public  to  medical  consultation  re-

sources, thus improving the quality of care available;

2) The  Network  serves  as  an  aid  in  the  training,  retention  and  recruitment  of

the rural health care workforce;

3) The Network provides another avenue for bringing community education and

information to rural Nebraska;

4) The Network, through its ability to help strengthen the rural health care re-

sources, helps strengthen the local economy;

5) The Network provides an additional resource in case of an emergency caused
by  a  man-made,  natural  or  bioterrorist  threat  as  well  as  providing  another
avenue for education on how to deal with these emergencies;

6) The  Network  provides  an  avenue  for  bringing  together  entities  in  public
health,  the  health  care  field,  education  and  government  as  well  as  other
quasi-public and private agencies through the participation in the Nebraska
Telehealth Network.

As a member of the Nebraska Telehealth Network, members of the Mid-Nebraska

Telemedicine Network has adopted the following project goals.
Project  Goals:  To  bring  together  the  hospitals  within  the  state  into  a  single  con-
nected system that can:

pital emergency rooms;

ment as well as advancement opportunities;

• Provide patient clinical consultation;
• Offer  health  care  providers  continuing  education  and  professional  develop-
• Provide an avenue for administrative meetings;
• Provide access to Teletrauma and Emergency Mental Health services via hos-
• Expand  access  for  the  hospitals  to  Nebraska’s  Public  Health  Departments,
State  Government  and  State  Bioterrorism  Labs  in  order  to  facilitate  emer-
gency alert capabilities, as well as educational opportunities pertaining to bio-
terrorism acts and other naturally occurring emergencies;
• Provide  a  structure  that  can  bring  together  resources  beyond  just  those  of
health  care  to  create  an  environment  of  sharing  of  resources  throughout  the
State of Nebraska;
• Invite other potential partners in this network, including education at various
levels  (elementary  through  post-secondary  and  community  education),  and
various governmental agencies, whether local, regional, State or national;
• Develop an organizational structure that supports these goals in a cost effec-
tive,  efficient  and  sustainable  fashion  and  addresses  the  identified  critical
success  factors  involving  technical  support,  hospital  and  provider  training,
scheduling and technology upgrades;
• Provide  the  backbone  for  the  development  of  a  statewide  electronic  medical

record project through the Nebraska Medical Association.

Testimony Summary
