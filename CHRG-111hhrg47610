• What  are  the  implications  and  unintended  consequences  of  current  export
control  policies  for  the  conduct  of  United  States  Government  and  commercial
science and technology activities and national security?

• How  does  U.S.  export  control  policy  affect  U.S.  scientific  and  technological

competitiveness?

• What  are  the  principal  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  National  Acad-
emies  report,  Beyond  ‘‘Fortress  America’’:  National  Security  Controls  on
Science  and  Technology  in  a  Globalized  World,  as  they  relate  to  the  conduct
of  U.S.  Government  and  commercial  science  and  technology  activities  and

tions and what are the most significant challenges in doing so?

• U.S.  export  control  policies  have  an  impact  on  the  conduct  of  the  U.S.  com-
mercial space industry and government civil space activities. What particular
issues  and  unintended  consequences  do  the  current  export  control  policies
present  for  U.S.  civil  and  commercial  space  activities,  including  space-based
research and human space flight activities? How serious are those issues and
what must be done to address the unintended consequences?

• What  are  the  most  critical  issues  relevant  to  U.S.  civil  government  and  com-
mercial  space  activities  that  should  be  considered  in  any  potential  review  of
U.S. export control policies?

• What  effect,  if  any,  do  the  unintended  consequences  of  U.S.  export  control

policies have on U.S. leadership in space in the near-term and long-term?

INTRODUCTION

4

The  Cold  War  sparked  the  United  States  to  make  historic  investments  in  sci-
entific  research  and  development  that  could  serve  our  national  security  needs,  in-
cluding  the  support  of  university,  government,  and  industrial  research  institutions.
Those  Cold  War  investments  created  a  robust  science  and  engineering  workforce,
drove  innovation,  fueled  economic  growth,  and  established  the  United  States’  pre-
eminence in science and technology.

The Soviets, however, sought access to U.S. technologies for potential military ap-
plications.  In  response,  the  U.S.  instituted  mechanisms  aimed  at  preventing  the
transfer  of  certain  U.S.-developed  components,  systems,  and  information  to  the  So-
viet Union and other adversaries. These national security controls include the classi-
fication system, export controls, limitations on the transfer of knowledge about tech-
nologies, visa controls, and measures to restrict the dissemination of certain govern-
ment-funded research that could threaten national security.

Export controls, which are the focus of this hearing, are directed by the Arms Ex-
port  Control  Act  of  1968  and  the  Export  Administration  Act  of  1979.  The  Arms  Ex-
port  Control  Act  governs  the  export  of  components  and  systems  that  are  listed  as
defense  articles;  the  Department  of  State  administers  the  International  Traffic  in
Arms Regulations (ITAR), which are the regulations to implement the Act. The U.S.
Munitions  List  (USML)  comprises  the  list  of  defense  articles  regulated  under  the
ITAR; and that list includes such categories of items as tanks and military vehicles,
aircraft  and  associated  equipment,  military  electronics,  optical  and  guidance  and
control  equipment,  toxicological  agents,  and  spacecraft  systems  and  associated
equipment. ITAR also controls technical data, including data for the design and de-
velopment of defense articles, and defense services, which are ‘‘The furnishing of as-
sistance  (including  training)  to  foreign  persons,  whether  in  the  United  States  or
abroad  in  the  design,  development,  engineering,  manufacture,  production,  assembly,
testing,  repair,  maintenance,  modification,  operation,  demilitarization,  destruction,
processing or use of defense articles’’ [International Traffic in Arms Regulations, Sec-
tion 120.9(a)(1)].

The  Export  Administration  Act  governs  the  export  of  dual-use  items—those  that
have  military  and  as  well  commercial  applications—including  software  and  tech-
nology.  The  Act  is  implemented  through  the  Export  Administration  Regulations
(EAR),  which  are  administered  by  the  Department  of  Commerce.  The  EAR  controls
the  export  of  dual-use  items  on  the  Commerce  Control  List,  including  software,
hardware,  and  other  systems  subject  to  the  EAR.  The  EAR  also  controls  ‘‘Any  re-
lease of technology or source code subject to the EAR to a foreign nation. Such release
is  deemed  to  be  an  export  to  the  home  country  or  countries  of  the  foreign  national.’’
[EAR  Part  734]  These  ‘‘deemed  exports’’  include  technology  or  software  released
through

‘‘(i) visual inspection by foreign nationals of U.S.-origin equipment and facilities;
(ii) oral exchanges of information in the United States and abroad; or
(iii) the application to situations abroad of personal knowledge or technical expe-
rience acquired in the United States.’’ [EAR Part 734]

The  Export  Administration  Act  has  ‘‘lapsed  several  times,’’  according  to  the  Na-
tional  Academies  report,  Beyond  ‘‘Fortress  America,’’  and  presidential  authorities
have  sustained  EAR  requirements  by  using  the  International  Economic  Emergency
Powers Act of 1977, ‘‘on the grounds that the expiration of the act poses an ‘unusual
and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security,  foreign  policy  and  economy  of  the
United States’,’’ according to the report.

What  these  controls  mean  in  practice  is  that  an  institution  such  as  a  company
or  university  may  need  to  apply  for  an  export  control  license  to  export  controlled
hardware  or  software  (for  example  as  part  of  an  international  space  research  mis-
sion  or  sale  of  a  product  or  components  abroad).  The  institution  may  also  need  to
obtain a license to share designs, conduct training related to the controlled item, or
discuss information about the item with a non-U.S. citizen who is abroad or working
in  the  U.S.  Export  control  licenses,  especially  ITAR  licenses,  require  a  significant
review and interagency approval process that may take months.

During  the  late  1990s,  the  implementation  of  export  control  policies  tightened  in
response  to  findings  about  the  unintentional  transfer  of  controlled  defense  tech-
nologies  and  information  to  China.  Since  those  changes,  the  time  required  to  ap-
prove ITAR licenses, in particular, has put stress on the federal agency systems for
processing  licenses  and  on  the  applicants  for  those  licenses.  In  2007,  the  Govern-
ment  Accountability  Office  (GAO)  commented  that  the  time  required  for  processing
export  licenses  ‘‘increased  from  a  median  of  13  days  in  2002  to  26  days  in  2006.’’
And  by  late  2006,  ‘‘State’s  backlog  of  applications  reached  its  highest  level  of  more

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:00 May 16, 2009 Jkt 047610 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\FULL09\022509\47610 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

5

than 10,000 open cases.’’ The time involved in obtaining Technical Assistance Agree-
ments  (TAAs),  which  are  required  to  discuss  ITAR-controlled  technologies,  has  also
increased.

These  delays  mean  that  commercial  companies  may  lose  the  opportunity  to  re-
spond to a bid while waiting for a license, and that government projects may be de-
layed and incur cost increases. Other impacts of export controls pertain to research-
ers  who  may  not  be  able  to  discuss  ideas  or  research  equipment  with  foreign  col-
leagues  at  an  international  conference  for  fear  of  inadvertently  transmitting  con-
trolled  information.  Failure  to  comply  with  the  ITAR  and  EAR  can  carry  fines  and
criminal penalties. The later sections of this charter provide additional examples of
the  unintended  consequences  of  the  policies  and  the  challenges  in  implementing
them.

A  large  number  of  organizations  have  made  statements,  released  positions,  led
studies, and issued recommendations for improvements to the export control system.
Some  of  those  institutions  include  The  Aerospace  Industries  Association,  the  Space
Enterprise  Council  of  the  U.S.  Chamber  of  Commerce,  the  Universities  Space  Re-
search  Association  [an  association  of  102  universities],  the  Space  Foundation,  the
Association  of  American  Universities,  the  Council  on  Governmental  Relations,  the
Center  for  Strategic  and  International  Studies,  and  the  Coalition  for  Security  and
Competitiveness  [which  includes  the  Aerospace  Industries  Association,  American
Association of Exporters and Importers, American Electronics Association, The Asso-
ciation for Manufacturing Technology, Business Roundtable, Chamber of Commerce
Space  Enterprise  Council,  Coalition  for  Employment  Through  Exports,  Electronic
Industries Alliance, General Aviation Manufacturing Association, Government Elec-
tronics  and  Information  Technology  Association,  Industrial  Fasteners  Institute,  In-
formation Technology Industry Council, National Association of Manufacturers, Na-
tional  Defense  Industrial  Association,  National  Foreign  Trade  Council,  Satellite  In-
dustries Association, Space Foundation and U.S. Chamber of Commerce.]

The  Department  of  State  has  taken  some  steps  to  increase  the  efficiency  of  proc-
essing  export  control  licenses.  However,  a  2007  GAO  report  commented  that  ‘‘De-
spite efforts to improve efficiency, State’s median processing times of license applica-
tions  have  been  increasing  since  2003.’’  In  January  2008,  the  Bush  Administration
issued  U.S.  Export  Control  Reform  Directives  to  ‘‘ensure  the  United  States’  export
control  policies  and  practices  support  the  National  Security  Strategy  of  2006,  while
facilitating  the  United  States’  continued  international  economic  and  technological
leadership,’’  according  to  a  release  issued  by  the  White  House  Office  of  the  Press
Secretary. A fact sheet released by the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Mili-
tary Affairs noted that the directives included making additional resources available
to  handle  defense  trade  licenses,  upgrading  an  electronic  licensing  system,  and  im-
proving dispute resolution and enforcement.

During  the  110th  Congress,  the  House  passed  H.R.  5916,  the  Security  Assistance
and  Arms  Export  Control  Reform  Act,  which  directed  the  President  ‘‘to  conduct  a
comprehensive  and  systematic  review  and  assessment  of  the  United  States  arms  ex-
port controls system in the context of the national security interests and strategic for-
eign policy objectives of the United States,’’ among other provisions. However, the bill
never  became  law.  During  the  110th  Congress,  the  House  also  passed  H.R.  6063,
the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2008,  which  was  introduced  by  Rep.  Mark  Udall,
chairman  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Space  and  Aeronautics,  Committee  on  Science
and  Technology.  H.R.  6063  directed  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy  to
carry out a study of export control policies related to civil and commercial space ac-
tivities.  The  House-passed  provision  did  not  make  it  into  law.  Other  legislation  on
export  controls  was  introduced  during  the  110th  Congress  but  was  not  acted  upon.
In  addition,  during  his  campaign,  then-candidate  Barack  Obama  issued  a  white
paper,  ‘‘Advancing  the  Frontiers  of  Space  Exploration,’’  in  which  he  stated  that  he
would  ‘‘direct  a  review  of  the  ITAR  to  reevaluate  restrictions  imposed  on  American
companies,  with  a  special  focus  on  space  hardware  that  is  currently  restricted  from
commercial export.’’ His paper also stated that he would revise the licensing process,
without  impact  to  American  national  security,  to  ensure  that  American  aerospace
supplier companies are competitive in the global market.

THE CHANGING ENVIRONMENT

The  geopolitical  landscape  has  changed  dramatically  since  national  security  con-
trols were put into place. Advances in communications technologies have facilitated
the growth of a global marketplace of goods and ideas. In addition, science and tech-
nology,  which  is  increasingly  international,  has  become  a  primary  agent  of  the  Na-
tion’s  national  and  economic  security.  Recently,  studies  sponsored  by  both  govern-
ment and non-government institutions have called for reexamining national security

controls in light of their impacts on our global scientific, technological, and economic
competitiveness.

In its January 2007 report, the GAO identified the export control system as a new
high  risk  area.  In  July  2007  the  GAO  released  a  report  in  which  it  found  that
‘‘Given the importance of the system in protecting U.S. national security, foreign pol-
icy, and economic interests, it is necessary to assess and rethink what type of system
is needed to best protect these interests in a changing environment.’’ And in January
2009 the GAO reported on the status of the government’s progress in implementing
GAO  recommendations.  Their  report,  Ensuring  the  Effective  Protection  of  Tech-
nologies Critical to U.S. National Security Interests, found that

‘‘Over the years, GAO has identified weaknesses in the effectiveness and efficiency
of government programs designed to protect critical technologies while advancing
U.S. interests. Since this area was designated high risk in 2007, the agencies re-
sponsible  for  administering  these  programs,  including  the  Departments  of  Com-
merce, Defense, Justice, State and the Treasury, have made improvements in sev-
eral  areas.  However,  vulnerabilities  continue  to  exist,  and  agencies  have  yet  to
take  action  to  address  GAO’s  major  underlying  concern,  which  is  the  need  for
a fundamental re-examination of current government programs to determine how
they  can  collectively  achieve  their  mission  and  to  evaluate  the  need  for  alter-
native approaches.’’

The  need  for  new  approaches  to  the  export  control  system  was  the  thrust  of  the
recently  released  National  Academies  report,  Beyond  ‘‘Fortress  America’’:  National
Security Controls on Science and Technology in a Globalized World. The report con-
sidered  the  multiple  dimensions  of  national  security  controls  including  ‘‘the  chang-
ing requirements of national security from the Cold War era, the impact of economic
globalization  on  the  U.S.  economy,  the  impact  of  the  globalization  of  science  and
technology on the U.S. economy and on its S&T leadership . . ..’’

The  National  Academies  report  took  a  broad  look  at  dual-use  export  controls—
those  technologies  that  may  have  both  commercial  and  military  applications—and
science  and  technology  competitiveness.  The  National  Academies  committee  also
considered visa policies given the importance, as discussed in the report, of the U.S.
being engaged in science and technology internationally and learning from the best
and brightest outside the U.S. The report did not address the classification system,
existing  statutes,  or  policies  that  may  prohibit  technology  transfers  to  a  particular
nation.  In  addition,  the  committee  did  not  make  recommendations  on  multilateral
export  control  regimes  or  consider  how  individual  agencies  manage  and  administer
export control regulations. The report specifically focused on issues that could be ad-
dressed through Executive authority.

In general, the report recommends significant changes to foster ‘‘openness and en-
gagement’’  and  that  would  require  the  government  to  provide  a  ‘‘rational  basis’’  for
restrictions  on  dual-use  items  planned  to  be  exported.  The  report  recommends  that
the  President  make  some  structural  and  policy  changes  by  issuing  an  Executive
Order  under  the  authority  of  the  International  Economic  Emergency  Powers  Act  of
1977.  According  to  the  report,  the  Act  allows  the  President  to  ‘‘structure  the  regu-
latory framework of the dual-use export controls system.’’

The  National  Academies  committee,  co-chaired  by  John  L.  Hennessy,  President,
Stanford University and Lt. General Brent Scowcroft (ret.),former National Security
Advisor, concluded:

‘‘As  a  nation,  we  cannot,  and  should  not  abandon  well-conceived  efforts  to  keep
dangerous  technology  and  scientific  know-how  out  of  the  hands  of  those  who
would  use  this  knowledge  to  create  weapons  of  mass  destruction  and  other,
equally dangerous military systems. However, these represent a very narrow and
limited  set  of  goods,  technology,  and  knowledge.  Our  former  unilateral  strategy
of  containment  and  isolation  of  our  adversaries  is,  under  current  conditions,  a
self-destructive strategy for obsolescence and declining economic competitiveness.
A  strategy  of  international  engagement  is  a  path  to  prosperity  that  can  be  cou-
pled  with  a  smarter  approach  to  security  using  an  adaptive  system  of  govern-
ment  regulation  and  incentives.  The  committee  recommends  the  issuance  of  an
Executive  Order  that  implements  the  recommendations  it  has  outlined  as  one  of
the first orders of business in January 2009.’’

Some of the elements of the Order would include:

• Establishing  a  process  for  removing  every  item  on  a  control  list  after  12

months unless there is a strong case for keeping it;

• An  economic  competitiveness  exemption  that  ‘‘eliminates  export  controls  on
dual-use technologies where they, or their functional equivalents, are available
without restriction in open markets outside the United States’’;

• Establishing  a  coordinating  center  for  export  controls  that  would  receive  li-
cense  applications,  determine  the  appropriate  jurisdiction  for  those  licenses
(i.e., Commerce or State), ensure the efficient processing of licenses, and man-
age an appeals process;

• Creating an independent export license appeals panel; and
• Ensuring support for excluding fundamental research from export controls.

The  complete  list  of  report  recommendations  is  included  in  Attachment  A  and  a

list of the members of the study committee is provided in Attachment B.

While the National Academies report addressed the broad and interrelated issues
of national security controls, economic security, and science and technology competi-
tiveness,  certain  sectors  of  scientific  research  and  commercial  activity  are  particu-
larly affected by the export control system. All satellites are export-controlled by the
ITAR,  and  the  implications  of  the  regulations  has  been  a  matter  of  concern  for  the
industries,  universities,  and  other  institutions  that  are  involved  in  commercial  and
civil  space  activities.  A  number  of  studies  have  examined  the  unintended  con-
sequences of export controls on the U.S. civil and commercial space sectors, and the
results  of  those  studies  and  the  issues  they  raise  are  detailed  in  later  sections  of
this charter.

Questions  related  to  the  National  Academies  report  include  such  things
as what, in specific terms, would be involved in implementing the National
Academies’ recommendations? At what point after an Executive Order is in
place should we expect to see improvements in the export control system?
What,  specifically,  does  the  recommended  Executive  Order  address?  What,
if  anything,  is  missing  from  the  Order?  What  areas  does  Congress  need  to
address?  How  would  implementing  the  recommendations  mitigate  the  im-
pacts  raised  in  specific  sectors  such  as  civil  and  commercial  space?  What
is  the  outlook  if  the  National  Academies’  recommendations  are  not  imple-
mented?

NATIONAL SECURITY

The  National  Academies  report,  ‘‘Beyond  ‘‘Fortress  America’’:  National  Security
Controls on Science and Technology in a Globalized World,’’ stated in the first find-
ing of the report:

‘‘Designed  for  the  Cold  War  when  the  U.S.  had  global  dominance  in  most  areas
of  science  and  technology,  the  current  system  of  export  controls  now  harms  our
national and homeland security, as well as our ability to compete economically.’’

The report also states:

‘‘. . .  the  export  control  system  enforced  in  the  U.S.  today  has  failed  to  evolve
with  changing  global  conditions,  and  now  produces  significant  harm  to  U.S.
military capability, to homeland security, and to the Nation’s economic competi-
tiveness.’’

The Department of Defense (DOD) examined the impact of export control policies
on  the  health  of  the  U.S.  space  industrial  base  and  issued  a  report  in  2007.  The
report, Defense Industrial Base Assessment: U.S. Space Industry Final Report, which
will be discussed in later sections of this charter, states that ‘‘The National Security
Space  Industrial  Base  (NSSIB)  is  critical  to  U.S.  success  in  developing  and  deploy-
ing national security space assets.’’ As part of the conclusions, the report states that:
‘‘To  maintain  and  enhance  the  U.S.  competitive  position  in  the  global  market,  ITAR
processes need to be frequently reviewed and adjusted, as appropriate.’’

In  response  to  direction  in  P.L.  109–364,  the  John  Warner  National  Defense  Au-
thorization  Act  for  Fiscal  Year  2007,  the  Institute  for  Defense  Analyses  produced  a
report, Leadership, Management, and Organization for National Security Space. The
report, which was prepared by an Independent Assessment Panel chaired by Mr. A.
Thomas  Young,  was  accompanied  by  a  letter  to  the  Honorable  Carl  Levin,  Chair-
man, Senate Committee on Armed Services that in part stated:

‘‘Today,  U.S.  leadership  in  space  provides  a  vital  national  advantage  across  the
scientific,  commercial,  and  national  security  realms.  In  particular,  space  is  of
critical  importance  to  our  national  intelligence  and  war-fighting  capabilities.
The  panel  members  nevertheless  are  unanimous  in  our  conviction  that,  without
significant  improvements  in  the  leadership  and  management  of  NSS  [national

security  space]  programs,  U.S.  space  preeminence  will  erode  to  the  extent  that
space ceases to provide a competitive national security advantage.’’

The  Independent  Assessment  Panel  (IAP)  referenced  a  study  by  the  Center  for
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) on the health of the U.S. space industrial
base,  and  noted  that  ‘‘The  IAP  supports  the  recommendations  of  the  CSIS  panel  to
revisit  the  ITAR  and  relax  those  aspects  that  are  counterproductive  to  U.S.  competi-
tiveness.’’ The findings of the CSIS study are discussed in later sections of this char-
ter.

CONTROVERSIES ABOUT EXPORT CONTROL REFORM

According  to  the  Congressional  Research  Service  report,  The  Export  Administra-
tion Act: Evolution, Provisions, and Debate, as updated on January 15, 2009, debate
on export administration legislation tends to involve a conflict between national se-
curity and commercial concerns:

‘‘These  concerns  are  not  mutually  exclusive  . . ..  For  example,  nearly  everyone
favors  reform  of  the  current  system,  yet  no  one  considers  themselves  opposed  to
national  security.  Generally,  however,  many  who  favor  reform  of  the  current  ex-
port  control  accept  the  business  perspective  that  such  reform  would  assist  U.S.
business  to  compete  in  the  global  marketplace.  Others  view  the  issue  more  from
a  national  security  perspective.  To  this  group,  reform  should  be  concerned  less
with  the  abilities  of  U.S.  industry  to  export  and  more  with  the  effective  controls
placed  on  potential  exports  to  countries  that  threaten  the  security  of  the  United
States,  terrorists,  violators  of  human  rights,  and  proliferators  of  weapons  of
mass destruction. From these different perspectives, controversies arise regarding
the  controllability  of  technology,  the  effectiveness  of  multinational  regimes,  the
bureaucratic  structure  of  the  licensing  process  and  the  impact  of  export  controls
on the U.S. economy.’’

ISSUES  AND  UNINTENDED  CONSEQUENCES  RELATED  TO  SCIENCE

AND TECHNOLOGY COMPETITIVENESS

Overarching Findings of National Academies Report

The National Academies report identifies a number of specific findings that argue

for revamping the current export control systems:

• ‘‘U.S.  national  security,  including  the  protection  of  the  homeland,  is  not  well

served by the current controls.

• The single technology base that today supports both U.S. commercial and mili-
tary  capabilities  is  constrained  from  expanding  into  new  fields  and  from  ap-
plying new scientific developments.

• Entire  international  markets  are  denied  to  U.S.  companies  because  they  are
forbidden  to  ship  their  technologically  sophisticated  products  to  foreign  coun-
tries.

• Obsolete lists of controlled components prevent U.S. companies from exporting
products  built  from  prior  generation  technologies  not  likely  to  harm  national
security.
• U.S.  scientists  are  hobbled  by  rules  that  prevent  them  from  working  with
world-class foreign scientists and with advanced laboratories located overseas,
making it less likely that valuable discoveries and inventions will occur in the
U.S.
• The government’s rules are driving jobs abroad—knowledge-intensive jobs crit-
• The government’s rules are accelerating the development of technologies in ca-

ical to the future of the U.S. economy.

pable research centers outside the U.S.’’

Impeding the Exchange of People and Ideas

The  health  of  the  U.S.  science  and  technology  depends  on  the  free  exchange  and
transport  of  ‘‘people,  ideas,  materials,  and  equipment,’’  as  described  in  the  National
Academies report. Increasingly, science and technology competitiveness is dependent
on having the ability to draw on the talent and capabilities of non-U.S. persons.

According to the report,

• ‘‘. . .  with  increasing  frequency,  important  discoveries  are  made  by  scientists
who work in teams and who have access to the best work going on in scientific
centers around the world and state-of-the-art instrumentation.’’

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:00 May 16, 2009 Jkt 047610 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\FULL09\022509\47610 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

9

• ‘‘Similarly,  in  a  world  in  which  breakthroughs  can  happen  anywhere,  being
competitive  requires  being  aware  of—and  capitalizing  on—developments  in
other places . . .’’

• ‘‘A  new  scientific  breakthrough,  or  a  newly  developed  technological  capability,
can  stimulate  additional  research  in  laboratories  around  the  world.  Although
science  does  depend  on  the  ability  of  researchers  to  validate  previously  pub-
lished results, the scientific reward system—and the allocation of competitively
awarded  resources—strongly  favors  the  first  to  publish.  Speed  is  equally  crit-
ical in bringing high-technology products to market.’’

U.S.  visa  policy  governs  our  ability  to  benefit  from  non-U.S.  scientific  talent.  The
policy  uses  lists  that  identify  certain  areas  of  academic  research,  particular  coun-
tries  of  concern,  and  specific  research  activities  that  require  applicants  to  undergo
special  review.  Visa  policies  were  tightened  after  9–11.  Although  ‘‘the  most  draco-
nian  rules  affecting  graduate  students  were  ameliorated’’  the  report  notes,  ‘‘signifi-
cant  barriers  still  remain  for  scholars  and  researchers  seeking  visas  to  attend  con-
ferences or for other short-term professional trips in the United States.’’

In  light  of  the  challenges  and  implications  of  export  control  and  visa  policies  for

carrying out fundamental research, the National Academies report finds that:

‘‘The  best  practices  that  underpin  successful  competition  in  research  and  tech-
nology  advancement  [freedom  of  inquiry,  freedom  to  pursue  knowledge  at  the
scientist’s  own  discretion,  freedom  to  collaborate  without  limitation,  pluralistic
and meritocratic support of science, and freedom to publish] are undermined by
government  regulation  that  restricts  the  flow  of  information  and  people  partici-
pating in fundamental research.’’

These  impediments  can  have  negative  effects  on  the  competitiveness  of  the  U.S.
scientific  infrastructure  within  the  global  environment.  For  instance,  the  report
notes that:

• ‘‘Breakthrough  discoveries  in  science  often  come  when  supporting  advance-
ments in related fields have occurred in sufficient numbers or new types of in-
strumentation  have  become  available.  If  one  researcher  or  laboratory  ‘misses’
a  new  advance,  it  is  likely  that  a  competitive  researcher  elsewhere  will  make
the discovery soon thereafter.’’

• ‘‘. . . export controls and ‘deemed export’ rules make U.S. universities less able
to  attract  the  most  capable  foreign  researchers  or  to  retain  some  of  the  most
creative faculty members. Important discoveries may be hindered, or may sim-
ply occur elsewhere.’’

• ‘‘Licensing  requirements  inevitably  lead  to  delays,  and  they  may  deter  or  even
eliminate  the  spontaneous  discoveries  that  arise  from  serendipitous  inter-
actions  and  spur-of-the  moment  collaborations,  most  of  which  are  impossible
under ‘deemed export’ rules.’’

• ‘‘The best foreign universities now have the research equipment and infrastruc-
ture  to  compete  with  the  best  U.S.  research  universities  for  students  and  re-
searchers.  Where  limitations  exist  on  foreigners  studying  or  working  in  the
U.S.  system,  foreign  universities  are  well  positioned  to  extend  competing  of-
fers.’’

Implications for America COMPETES Act

The issues noted above have implications for the Nation’s innovation and competi-
tiveness and the types of actions directed in the America COMPETES Act [P.L. 110–
69],  which  has  as  its  three  primary  goals:  1)  increasing  research  investment,  2)
strengthening  educational  opportunities  in  science,  technology,  engineering,  and
mathematics;  and  3)  developing  an  innovation  infrastructure.  The  National  Acad-
emies  report,  Rising  Above  the  Gathering  Storm,  which  provided  the  basis  for  the
Act,  recognized  the  impacts  of  export  controls  and  recommended  that  the  current
system of ‘‘deemed exports’’ be reformed:

‘‘The new system should provide international students and researchers engaged
in fundamental research in the United States with access to information and re-
search  equipment  in  U.S.  industrial,  academic,  and  national  laboratories  com-
parable  with  the  access  provided  to  U.S.  citizens  and  permanent  residents  in  a
similar  status  . . .  In  addition,  the  effect  of  deemed  export  regulations  on  the
education and fundamental research work of international students and scholars
should be limited . . ..’’

Using Lists to Control Exports

10

Using  lists  such  as  the  Commerce  Control  List  and  the  U.S.  Munitions  Control
List,  according  to  the  National  Academies  report,  are  ineffective  ways  to  control
technology  transfer  because  the  technologies  and  information  on  the  lists  are,  in
many  cases,  available  for  sale  on  the  open  market  from  non-U.S.  sources.  The  lists
can also have the effect of advancing indigenous science and technology capabilities
and  competitiveness  elsewhere.  For  example,  the  report  notes  that  foreign  nations
may use the lists to prioritize research and development investments, because they
anticipate  that  U.S.  companies  and  institutions  may  face  challenges  in  exporting
those  controlled  technologies  abroad.  The  case  of  U.S.  commercial  communications
satellite  development  exemplifies  this  point.  As  a  result  of  ITAR  hurdles,  Europe
began to develop satellite components itself and to produce satellites that do not use
U.S.-developed technologies rather than purchase the components, which are ITAR-
controlled, from the U.S.

The  lists  also  affect  how  U.S.  researchers  make  decisions  on  the  type  of  research
they  pursue.  The  National  Academies  report  notes  that  ‘‘Some  avoid  research  in
areas  that  are  affected  by  federal  controls  out  of  an  apprehension  that  significant
work  may  not  be  published  or  that  students  or  researchers  needed  for  first-rate  lab-
oratories will not be available. Breakthroughs will thereby be thwarted.’’

The  recommendation  from  the  National  Academies  is  to:  ‘‘Apply  ‘sunset’
requirements to all items on export control lists that are controlled unilat-
erally  by  the  U.S.,  and  require  findings  to  be  made  every  12  months  that
removing  controls  on  an  item  would  present  a  substantial  risk  to  national
security.’’

Fundamental Research Exemptions

In  1985,  President  Reagan  issued  National  Security  Decision  Directive  (NSDD)
189,  which  recognizes  that  ‘‘our  leadership  position  in  science  and  technology  is  an
essential element in our economic and physical security’’ and ‘‘The strength of Amer-
ican science requires a research environment conducive to creativity, an environment
in  which  the  free  exchange  of  ideas  is  a  vital  component.’’  To  that  end,  NSDD  189
states:

‘‘It is the policy of this Administration that, to the maximum extent possible, the
products of fundamental research remain unrestricted. It is also the policy of this
Administration that, where the national security requires control, the mechanism
for  control  of  information  generated  during  federally-funded  fundamental  re-
search in science, technology and engineering at colleges, universities and labora-
tories is classification.’’

During  the  late  1990s,  however,  the  implementation  of  export  control  policies
tightened  in  response  to  findings  about  the  unintentional  transfer  of  controlled  de-
fense  technologies  and  information  to  China,  and  those  changes  raised  questions
about the fundamental research protections under NSDD 189.

In 2001, former National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice reaffirmed the Direc-
tive,  and  in  2002  the  State  Department  modified  the  ITAR  as  it  applies  to  defense
articles  developed  at  U.S.  universities  for  use  in  fundamental  research.  Section
123.16(10) of the ITAR states that:

‘‘Port  Directors  of  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection  shall  permit,  without  a
license,  the  permanent  export,  and  temporary  export  and  return  to  the  United
States,  by  accredited  U.S.  institutions  of  higher  learning  of  articles  fabricated
only for fundamental research purposes.’’

The exemption includes several conditions, including:

• ‘‘The  export  is  to  an  accredited  institution  of  higher  learning,  a  governmental
research center or an established government funded private research center lo-
cated within countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’’ or that have
been designated as a non-NATO ally.
• ‘‘All of the information about the article(s), including its design, and all of the
resulting information obtained through fundamental research involving the ar-
ticle  will  be  published  and  shared  broadly  within  the  scientific  community,
and is not restricted for proprietary reasons or specific U.S. Government access
and dissemination controls or other restrictions accepted by the institutions or
its  researchers  on  publication  of  scientific  and  technical  information  resulting
from the project or activity . . ..’’

Despite  the  attempts  to  address  the  matter,  the  fundamental  research  exclusion
‘‘has not had the effect of precluding all such restrictions’’ according to the National

Academies  report.  The  Council  on  Governmental  Relations  and  the  Association  of
American Universities has conducted surveys of U.S. research universities to gauge
the problem of restrictive clauses on research. According to their report, Restrictions
on Research Awards: Troublesome Clauses 2007/2008, issued in July 2008,

‘‘. . .  federal  agencies  are  expanding  the  type  of  controls  they  impose  in  award
terms  and  conditions  and  are  using  more  sophisticated  (and  varying)  technical
language  and  approaches  for  implementing  restrictions  that  affect  university  re-
search  projects.  Particularly  alarming  is  the  spread  of  restrictive  award  terms
by  federal  agencies  beyond  contracts  to  federal  assistance  mechanisms,  such  as
grants.’’

Universities  maintain  that  the  export  control  regulations  are  confusing  with  re-
spect  to  fundamental  research,  especially  given  that  research  usually  involves  par-
ticipation  by  non-U.S.  persons  in  American  universities  or  abroad,  and  interactions
with them may be considered exports.

The  National  Academies  committee  ‘‘recommends  that  the  Fundamental
Research  Exemption  be  maintained,  adhered  to,  and  properly  imple-
mented.  Universities  and  other  research  institutions  have  worked  under
this  regime  successfully  and  have  in  place  the  necessary  mechanisms  to
comply with the exemption.’’

ISSUES  AND  UNINTENDED  CONSEQUENCES  FOR  U.S.  GOVERNMENT

CIVIL AND COMMERCIAL SPACE ACTIVITIES

Commercial  and  civil  space  activities  make  significant  contributions  to  the  econ-
omy  and  the  Nation’s  science  and  technology  capabilities.  In  2008,  global  sales  for
U.S.  aerospace  companies  totaled  $204  billion  of  which  $33  billion  was  for  the  U.S.
sales  of  space  systems,  according  to  the  Aerospace  Industries  Association.  Univer-
sities,  federal  laboratories,  research  institutions,  along  with  private  industry,  con-
duct the Nation’s space-based research activities. These commercial and research ac-
tivities  help  engage  and  train  the  next  generation  of  scientists  and  engineers  and
develop innovative technologies that contribute to our economic competitiveness.

The  aerospace  industry,  especially  the  satellite  manufacturing  industry,  has  long
maintained  that  export  controls  have  led  to  decreasing  competitiveness  and  loss  of
market share in the global market. In addition, space science researchers have iden-
tified unintended consequences of the ITAR on fundamental space research. Govern-
ment officials have also questioned whether export controls are affecting the health
of the space and defense industry. Recent studies have examined the impacts of ex-
port controls on these space sectors.

In  2007,  the  DOD  completed  a  study,  Defense  Industrial  Base  Assessment:  U.S.
Space Industry Final Report, which involved gathering quantitative data on the U.S.
space  industrial  base  and  reviewing  whether  export  controls  were  affecting  the  in-
dustry.  The  study  involved  a  survey  of  companies  and  business  units  that  included
prime  contractors  that  sell  products  to  commercial  and/or  government  institutions
(Tier  1),  subcontractors  that  provide  major  components  and  systems  to  prime  con-
tractors (Tier 2), and lower tier companies that sell subassemblies, structures, mate-
rials  and  less  complex  components  as  well  as  engineering  and  other  services  (Tier
3).  The  DOD  Industrial  Base  Assessment  found  that  ITAR  is  having  an  impact  on
industry  sales  and  competitiveness;  examples  of  these  impacts  are  provided  in  the
sections below.

In  2008,  the  CSIS  issued  a  Briefing  of  the  Working  Group  on  the  Health  of  the
U.S.  Space  Industrial  Base  and  the  Impact  of  Export  Controls,  which  reviewed  the
results  of  the  2007  DOD  Defense  Industrial  Base  Assessment,  interviewed  and  col-
lected data from across the government, industry, and other experts, and examined
the findings of other reports on export controls. The findings of the CSIS study echo
many  of  the  issues  affecting  the  broader  areas  of  science  and  technology  that  were
raised  in  the  National  Academies  report.  The  CSIS  report  concludes,  for  example,
that:

• U.S. policies are not controlling the rapid proliferation of non-U.S. space capa-

bilities and in some cases the policies are encouraging them;

• U.S. preeminence in space is being challenged;
• Current export control policies are restricting U.S. international space activi-
ties and partnerships; they have led to separation between U.S. and emerging
non-U.S. space actors;

• Certain elements of export controls are in variance with U.S. National Space

Policy; and

• U.S.  market  share  in  foreign  space  markets  is  declining  and  it  is  harder  for
U.S. companies to compete in non-U.S. markets, particularly for the lower tier
companies.

The  implications  of  these  conclusions  are  described  further  in  the  sections  below.
The  National  Academies  held  a  workshop  on  the  implications  of  the  ITAR  and
space science. In 2008, the Academies released, Space Science and the International
Traffic  in  Arms  Regulations:  Summary  of  a  Workshop.  The  workshop  summary
pointed  to  the  disconnect  between  the  ITAR  regulations,  the  fundamental  research
exemption,  and  the  way  in  which  space-based  research  is  conducted.  The  ambigu-
ities and uncertainties in the interpretation of and application of the ITAR require-
ments  are  leading  academic  institutions  to  be  overly  conservative  in  their  actions.
This  results  in  concerns  over  loss  of  competitiveness  in  scientific  research  and  edu-
cation at U.S. institutions of higher learning, according to the report.

Increasing Foreign Capability and Diminished U.S. Leadership in Space

The  CSIS  report  found  that  ‘‘United  States  preeminence  in  space  in  under  chal-
lenge in many areas.’’ Export controls have not thwarted the increasing capabilities
of foreign space programs.

• According  to  the  CSIS  report,  Chinese  and  Indian  space  programs  have  con-
tinued  to  make  considerable  progress  including  the  launching  of  indigenous
high  resolution  imaging  satellites,  lunar  probes,  and  China’s  successful
launch  of  a  human  into  outer  space  and  the  successful  execution  of  its  first
human space-walk activity.
• The report also notes that the number of nations with their own space-based
positioning  and  navigation  systems  has  tripled  since  1999;  the  number  of
countries possessing earth observation and reconnaissance satellites has dou-
bled  since  1999;  at  least  twelve  nations  are  capable  of  launching  their  own
satellites;  and  38  countries  can  control  the  operations  of  their  own  commu-
nication satellites.
• According  to  CSIS,  the  capabilities  of  non-U.S.  space  countries  participating
in the commercial market has also grown. Non-U.S. companies are now capa-
ble  of  producing  commercial  communications  satellites  that  are  on  par  with
those of the U.S.

Æ As noted in the CSIS report, ‘‘Since 1998, European and Asian manufac-
turers  of  satellites  have  gone  from  delivering  satellites  that  were  smaller,
had  fewer  transponders,  lesser  payload  power  and  shorter  lives  to  manu-
facturing  satellites  of  equal  weight,  number  of  transponders,  payload
power and lifespan.’’

Æ Europe has developed ITAR-free components and systems.
Æ According  to  a  news  item  of  the  European  Space  Agency,  the  European
Commission,  the  European  Space  Agency,  and  the  European  Defense
Agency  ‘‘have  agreed  to  join  forces  in  order  to  develop  critical  space  tech-
nologies  in  Europe.  The  aim  is  to  ensure  that  Europe  can  rely  on  a  tech-
nical and industrial capacity for accessing space, in particular in the area
of the manufacturing of satellites and launchers.’’

• Foreign  innovation  and  human  capital  are  important  to  U.S.  leadership  in
space  but  are  increasingly  harder  to  access.  The  U.S.  has  benefited  from  for-
eign  innovation  and  talent.  Foreign  students  obtain  more  than  half  of  the
Ph.D.s  in  science,  technology,  and  engineering  and  workers  born  outside  of
the U.S. account for more than a quarter of the science and technology work-
force in the U.S., according to the CSIS report. Export controls make it more
difficult  to  take  advantage  of  this  talent  pool,  as  noted  in  the  CSIS  report.

Conflicts with Objectives of U.S. National Space Policy

In  1996,  the  Clinton  Administration  issued  a  National  Space  Policy  in  which  the

policy’s commercial space guidelines stated:

‘‘The  fundamental  goal  of  U.S.  commercial  space  policy  is  to  support  and  en-
hance U.S. economic competitiveness in space activities while protecting U.S. na-
tional security and foreign policy interests. Expanding U.S. commercial space ac-
tivities will generate economic benefits for the Nation and provide the U.S. Gov-
ernment with an increasing range of space goods and services.’’

In 2006, the Bush Administration issued a U.S. National Space Policy, which su-

perseded the 1996 policy, and states that:

‘‘The United States Government will pursue, as appropriate, and consistent with
U.S.  national  security  interests,  international  cooperation  with  foreign  nations
and/or  consortia  on  space  activities  that  are  of  mutual  benefit  and  that  further
the peaceful exploration and use of space.’’

The  2006  Policy  also  supports  the  use  of  effective  export  policies  and  states  that
‘‘space-related  exports  that  are  currently  available  or  are  planned  to  be  available  in
the global marketplace shall be considered favorably.’’

The goals of the space policy include:

• ‘‘Strengthen  the  Nation’s  space  leadership  and  ensure  that  space  capabilities
are available in time to further U.S. national security, homeland security, and
foreign policy objectives;’’

• ‘‘Enable  a  dynamic,  globally  competitive  domestic  commercial  space  sector  in
order to promote innovation, strengthen U.S. leadership, and protect national,
homeland, and economic security;’’

• ‘‘Encourage international cooperation with foreign nations and/or consortia on
space activities that are of mutual benefit and that further the peaceful explo-
ration and use of space, as well as to advance national security, homeland se-
curity, and foreign policy objectives.’’

The  CSIS  report  found  that  aspects  of  current  export  control  policies  and  regula-
tions are at variance with the national space policy. For instance, the export control
system  does  not  enable  cooperation  while  also  denying  capabilities  to  adversaries.
Placing  satellites  on  the  USML  has  encouraged  the  development  of  non-U.S.  space
capabilities,  and  ITAR  regulations  have  had  negative  impacts  for  U.S.  industry.
CSIS  also  notes  that  export  controls  have  interfered  with  a  legacy  of  beneficial  col-
laboration  with  foreigners  and  have  made  it  difficult  for  international  partners  to
resolve anomalies in collaborative space activities.

Issues for Fundamental Research Using Space-Based Hardware

In  response  to  concerns  about  the  transfer  of  export  controlled  hardware  and  in-
formation  to  China  during  the  1990s,  the  Strom  Thurmond  National  Defense  Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 [P.L. 105–261] transferred ‘‘all satellites and re-
lated  items  that  are  on  the  Commerce  Control  List  of  dual-use  items  . . .  to  the
United  States  Munitions  List  and  controlled  under  section  38  of  the  Arms  Export
Control Act . . ..’’

In 2002, the Department of State revised the ITAR language concerning scientific
satellites for fundamental research. ITAR licenses are not required for scientific re-
search  satellites  when  specific  conditions  are  met.  Space  researchers,  however,  re-
port  confusion  about  the  application  of  that  exemption  to  space  research  projects.
The  summary  report  of  the  National  Academies  workshop  on  space  science  and
ITAR noted that regulations are applied differently to institutions involved in a sin-
gle space project—national labs, universities, industry, and government. In addition,
researchers are unclear about the type of information that can be placed in the pub-
lic  domain,  including  in  the  classroom.  Moreover,  the  fundamental  research  exclu-
sion  in  the  ITAR  applies  only  to  ‘‘accredited  U.S.  institutions  of  higher  learning.’’
There  is  also  a  lack  of  clarity  about  involving  foreign  students  and  researchers  in
space  research  projects  that  may  use  ITAR-controlled  technology.  Researchers  are
also  unclear  about  what  information  regarding  a  satellite  project  they  can  share
with non-U.S. individuals or students in an academic environment.

In  the  absence  of  clarity,  universities  and  researchers  interpret  regulations  con-
servatively  and  may  add  burdens  that  are  not  necessary  and  lead  to  decisions  that
affect  university  engagement  in  space  research.  For  example,  according  to  the  Na-
tional Academies’ workshop summary, universities and researchers may make deci-
sions not to pursue projects requiring ITAR licenses or to allow non-U.S. researchers
and  students  to  participate  in  space  research  projects.  In  addition,  the  report  says
that ‘‘uncertainties are leading some professors to ‘dumb down’ course content rather
than risk ITAR violations by discussing their research in the classroom setting.’’

The  workshop  summary  on  space  science  and  ITAR  also  notes  that  compliance
‘‘creates  a  significant  unfunded  mandate  for  universities,  because  they  operate  with
capped overhead costs . . ..’’ In addition, universities bear the costs of educating fac-
ulty and contracting and grants officers, maintaining documentation, handling nego-
tiations with the State Department, and ‘‘the substantial costs of delays in securing
approvals for activities that fall under ITAR,’’ according to the report.

Reduced Competitiveness of Space Industry

Both  the  CSIS  study  and  the  Defense  Industrial  Base  Assessment  make  findings
about the increasing challenges that U.S. space companies face in being competitive
in  foreign  markets.  According  to  the  results  of  the  DOD-initiated  space  industrial
survey,  ‘‘Defense  Industrial  Base  Assessment:  U.S.  Space  Industry  Final  Report,’’
several companies voluntarily commented that ITAR was an issue in being competi-
tive in foreign space markets. For example, the Assessment notes that:

‘‘Over two-thirds of the survey respondents felt strongly enough to add narrative
comments  with  over  a  quarter  of  those  encountering  difficulties  in  export  mar-
kets.  Some  companies  have  self-eliminated  from  foreign  markets  to  focus  on  the
domestic only market.’’
‘‘There have been a number of firms in all tiers that have not applied for export
licenses  (half  of  the  companies  surveyed)  due  to  real  or  perceived  problems  with
navigating the licensing process.’’

One company commented that it chose to forgo space business because that busi-
ness has not been profitable and some foreign customers will not procure items that
require ITAR licenses.

Æ Of the companies that participated in the survey for the DOD Assessment, 58
percent  listed  export  controls  as  the  number  one  barrier  to  entry  when  at-
tempting to market products abroad.

Æ According  to  the  DOD  Assessment,  ‘‘Companies  reported  $2.35B  of  ITAR-re-
lated potential sales lost due to the licensing process from 2003–2006, an aver-
age  of  $588M  annually.  This  loss  represents  about  one  percent  of  total  U.S.
space revenues.’’ [Note that the $588M figure is a best estimate and does not
include  opportunities  that  were  not  pursued  or  that  were  lost  due  to  ITAR.
It may also involve some double-counting among competitors.]

Æ The  cost  of  managing  compliance  with  export  controls  is  another  challenge.
‘‘Space industry-wide compliance costs averaged $49M per year in 2003–2006,’’
according to the DOD Assessment, and created a significant financial burden,
especially for smaller companies.

The  CSIS  recommendation  is  to  ‘‘Remove  from  the  Munitions  List  com-
mercial  communications  satellite  systems,  dedicated  subsystems,  and  com-
ponents  specifically  designed  for  commercial  use;  provide  safeguards  by
having  Defense  Department  identify  critical  space  components  and  tech-
nologies that should always require licensing and referral. Have the appro-
priate  executive  departments  conduct  a  study  to  see  if  other  space  tech-
nologies should be removed from the list.’’

Pronounced  Impacts  on  Competitiveness  of  Smaller  and  New  Commercial  Space

Companies

The  Assessment  and  the  CSIS  report  found,  in  particular,  that  the  burden  of
ITAR is ‘‘more pronounced’’ for smaller companies (the lower tiers) in terms of com-
pliance costs and exports to foreign systems for example. It is the lower tier compa-
nies  that  are  often  the  sources  of  innovation.  The  CSIS  study  found  that  ‘‘Export
controls  are  adversely  affecting  U.S.  companies’  ability  to  compete  for  foreign  space
business, particularly the second and third tier. And it is the 2nd/3rd tier of the in-
dustry  that  is  the  source  of  much  innovation,  and  is  normally  the  most  engaged  in
the  global  market  place  in  the  aerospace/defense  sector.’’  In  addition,  the  President
and  CEO  of  the  General  Aviation  Manufacturers  Association  (GAMA)  stated  at  a
March 2008 forum on export controls that ‘‘small companies where much of the inno-
vation  takes  place  [are]  leary  of  participating  in  a  program  that  could  put  them  in
a position of inadvertently violating export control rules.’’

One  space  company  that  is  aiming  to  sell  access  to  a  commercial  space  habitat
found that the modular inflatable technology that forms the basis of its space habi-
tat is export controlled. The company also ran into ITAR problems with a basic tech-
nical stand. As the company President, Robert Bigelow, reported in a February 2008
article  in  Space  News,  ‘‘A  wonderful  example  of  the  irrationality  of  the  current  re-
gime  is  the  ’technical  stand’  from  our  Genesis  campaigns.  This  simple  aluminum
stand  is  composed  of  a  circular  base  with  several  legs  sticking  out.  If  you  were  to
turn  the  stand  upside  down  it  would  literally  be  indistinguishable  from  a  common
coffee table. However, under the current export control regime, the stand was consid-
ered  ‘ITAR  hardware’  and  we  were  required  to  have  two  security  officers  guarding
the stand on a 24/7 basis while at our launch base in Russia.’’

Lost Revenue in Satellite Manufacturing Market

15

The CSIS report notes that ‘‘Study after study shows the same results, an erosion

of U.S. share of the global commercial satellite market since the late 1990s.’’

In addition, the DOD Assessment, shows that, based on Satellite Industry Associa-

tion reports in 2004 and 2006,

Æ ‘‘The  U.S.  share  of  global  satellite  manufacturing  has  decreased  since  the

ITAR changes were implemented in 1999.’’

Æ ‘‘U.S.  market  share  dropped  from  63  percent  in  1996–1998  to  52  percent  in

1999–2001 and 42 percent in 2002–2006.’’

Æ ‘‘Revenues dropped in real terms as well from an average of $6.6B in the first
period,  to  $5.5B  in  the  transition  period,  and  $4.2B  in  the  most  recent  period
of the data.’’

Æ ‘‘U.S.  share  of  GEO  [geostationary]  commercial  communications  satellites

manufactured has decreased 10 percent since 1998.’’

Challenges for Government-Sponsored International Space Activities
Much  of  the  Nation’s  civil  space  activities  are  international  given  the  global  na-
ture  of  the  marketplace,  the  benefits  of  commercial  strategic  partnerships,  and  the
legacy  of  cooperation  in  NASA’s  space-based  scientific  research  and  human  explo-
ration  mission  programs.  Export  controls  hinder  these  activities  and  may  introduce
safety concerns. The NASA director for export control noted at a March 2008 Aero-
space States Association forum on Export Controls that:

‘‘Unfortunately,  certain  provisos  requiring  separate  and  specific  government  re-
view and approval for any collaborative anomaly resolution activity may impede
the ability of NASA’s contractors to expeditiously take action to assure operations
safety  and  mission  success,  including  during  real-time  operations,  where  an
anomaly  could  be  encountered.’’  He  said  ‘‘Rendezvous  and  docking  of  the  Euro-
pean  Automated  Transfer  Vehicle  (ATV)  and  Japanese  H–II  Transfer  Vehicle
(HTV)  with  the  International  Space  Station  are  time-critical  operations  that  re-
quire  timely  exchange  of  information  for  effective  operations.  In  the  event  of  an
on-orbit problem, for the safety of the Space Station and its crew, ATV and HTV
engineers must be able to quickly and easily share technical data—in real-time—
with U.S. engineers . . ..’’

Along  those  same  lines,  a  2007  report  of  the  International  Space  Station  Inde-
pendent  Safety  Task  Force  (IISTF)  explained  that  ‘‘Currently  the  ITAR  restrictions
and the IP’s objections to signing technical assistance agreements are a threat to the
safe  and  successful  integration  and  operations  of  the  Station.’’  The  study  rec-
ommended that the State Department grant relief to NASA contractors working di-
rectly  with  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS)  international  partners  and  their
contractors  to  enable  engineering  and  safety  reviews,  program  management  inter-
actions,  and  to  handle  anomaly  resolution  among  other  specific  activities  and  that
the  ‘‘Executive  and  Legislative  Branches  of  the  government  should  conduct  a  com-
prehensive  and  thorough  review  of  government  policies  and  procedures  related  to
ITAR and related export controls as soon as practical.’’

The  CSIS  recommendation  on  anomaly  resolution  is  that:  ‘‘The  Secretary  of  De-
fense  and  NASA  Administrator,  in  addition  to  the  Secretary  of  State,  should  have
the  authority  to  grant  real-time,  case-by-case,  specific  time  period  exemptions  for
anomaly resolutions deemed to be in the national interest based on criteria from the
National Space Policy.’’

The NASA export control director also commented that the State Department has
‘‘advised NASA to seek legislative authority as a prerequisite to the Department’s pro-
mulgation  of  an  exemption  to  facilitate  the  implementation  of  NASA’s  programs,  in-
cluding  the  U.S.  Space  Exploration  Policy.’’  The  Bush  Administration  did  not  send
any proposed legislation to Congress regarding this export control matter.

A significant portion of NASA’s science missions involve international cooperation
in which export controls apply. At a hearing of the House Committee on Science and
Technology,  Subcommittee  on  Space  and  Aeronautics,  held  in  March  2008  to  exam-
ine  NASA’s  science  programs,  Dr.  Jack  Burns,  a  professor  from  the  University  of
Colorado  noted:  ‘‘. . .  we  need  to  be  looking  at  more  international  cooperation  be-
cause  sharing  the  costs  and  the  risks  associated  with  these  large  projects  in  astro-
physics  . . .  The  ITAR  restrictions  are  making  it  more  difficult  than  they  need  to
be.’’  Another  witness  at  the  hearing,  Dr.  Steven  Squyres  of  Cornell  University,  the
Principal  Investigator  for  the  Mars  Exploration  Rovers  (Spirit  and  Opportunity),
testified that ‘‘many talented students come and want to work on the mission. These
are  students  and  post-docs  from  Denmark  and  Canada,  and  we  have  had  to  turn

away people because of the restrictions on ITAR. And these are people who can mate-
rially advance a U.S. space mission and make it a better mission.’’

In  addition,  the  National  Academies  workshop  summary  on  space  science  and
ITAR  raised  concern  over  the  ability  to  continue  international  collaborations,  espe-
cially  as  projects  become  increasingly  more  complicated.  The  workshop  summary
notes that:

‘‘The  costs  and  delays  imposed  by  ITAR  processing  requirements  coupled  with
other nations’ reluctance to be made subject to restrictions derived from U.S. law
and regulations, are making the United States less and less desirable as a part-
ner to its foreign collaborations. The implications for continued international col-
laboration are grave.’’ The workshop summary also said that ‘‘International par-
ticipants in the workshop went so far as to speculate that without high-level U.S.
Government  relief  on  ITAR,  the  development  of  highly  integrated  infrastructure
programs,  such  as  those  envisioned  for  human  space  exploration,  will  be  impos-
sible.’’

National  Academies,  Beyond  ‘‘Fortress  America’’:  National
Security  Controls  on  Science  and  Technology  in  a
Globalized World, 2009

Excerpt from the Executive Summary

‘‘Recommendations

The  committee  structured  its  recommendations  into  three  areas:  reforming  the  ex-
port  control  process,  ensuring  scientific  and  technological  competitiveness,  and  im-
proving  the  non-immigrant  visa  system  that  regulates  the  entry  into  the  United
States of foreign science and engineering students, scholars, and professionals.

In  the  committee’s  view,  it  is  important  to  act  immediately,  within  the  boundaries
of  the  President’s  authority  to  ameliorate  the  policy  logjam  that  is  the  unintended
consequence  of  Congress’s  inaction  over  dual-use  export  controls.  The  new  President
needs  to  make  the  changes  that  will  stem  a  serious  decline  affecting  broad  areas  of
the Nation’s security and economy.
Recommendation  1.  The  President  should  restructure  the  export  control  process
within the federal government so that the balancing of interests can be achieved more
efficiently  and  harm  can  be  prevented  to  the  Nation’s  security  and  technology  base;
in addition to promoting U.S. economic competitiveness.

Restructuring  the  export  control  process  does  not  involve  abandoning  all  export
controls.  Rather,  the  committee  recommends  that  two  policy  changes  and  two  struc-
tural  changes  be  made  to  retain  needed  export  controls  while  shedding  the  largest
obstacles  to  an  efficient  system.  With  these  changes  implemented  in  an  expedient
manner, the United States will stem the loss of technological and economic competi-
tiveness  and  begin  to  benefit  from  carefully  targeted  and  calibrated  controls  that  re-
flect  and  meet  current  challenges  that  the  country  faces  in  protecting  both  our  na-
tional security and our economic well-being.

Action Items
A.  Recognize  the  interdependence  of  national  security  and  economic  competitiveness
factors  in  making  export  control  decisions  with  respect  to  individual  requests  for  li-
censes through a principle-based system.

When the licensing agency applies principles to decisions about export controls, the
focus  will  stay  on  why  items  should  or  should  not  continue  to  be  controlled,  rather
than  on  adding  to  otherwise  static  lists  of  controlled  items.  This  kind  of  governance
system  can  assess  each  decision  in  terms  of  whether  an  item  should  be  controlled
against the governing principles that have been established within the system. Doing
so  can  ensure  that  the  remaining  controlled  items  are  relevant  to  rapidly  changing
global  conditions.  It  can  also  help  ensure  that  decisions  are  made  in  a  timely  man-
ner. The following are the principles that the committee recommends:

1. Maintain  the  value  of  protecting  traditional  U.S.  national  security  in  export

control policy.

2. Recognize  that  today  this  value  must  be  balanced  against  the  equally  impor-
tant value of maintaining and enhancing the scientific and technological com-
petitiveness of the United States.

3. Allow  openness  and  engagement  to  prevail  unless  a  compelling  case  can  be

made for restrictions.

4. Articulate  a  rational  basis  for  each  restriction.  Restrictions  on  unclassified

technology should be implemented only when:

a. The  U.S.  alone,  or  the  U.S.  and  cooperating  allies,  possess  technology
that  leads  not  only  to  identifiable  military  advantage,  but  to  an  advan-
tage that is likely to persist for a significant period of time (i.e., the time
needed to field a system based on that technology);

b. The  U.S.,  or  the  U.S.  acting  together  with  allies,  control  the  technology
such that they can prevent it from moving into the hands of possible ad-
versaries;

c. The restrictions do not impose costs and inefficiencies that are dispropor-

tionate to the restrictions’ security benefits; and

18

d. Restrictions  are  re-examined  and  re-adjusted  periodically  to  ensure  they

remain appropriate.

5. Protect the capability to ‘‘run faster.’’
6. Treat weapons separately—but define them narrowly and precisely.
7. Recognize the ‘‘global public good’’ nature of health-related technologies.

B. Apply ‘‘sunset’’ requirements to all items on export control lists that are controlled
unilaterally  by  the  U.S.,  and  require  findings  to  be  made  every  12  months  that  re-
moving controls on an item would present a substantial risk to national security. No
version  of  the  current  control  system  should  survive  without  an  effective  method  for
pruning items from the control lists when they no longer serve a significant definable
national security interest.
C. Establish as a new administrative entity a coordinating center for export controls,
with  responsibilities  for  coordinating  all  interfaces  with  persons  or  entities  seeking
export licenses and expediting agency processes with respect to the granting or denial
of export licenses.

This small coordinating entity would be responsible for:

plications do not languish;

• Receiving all applications for export licenses;
• Determining whether the Department of Commerce or the Department of State
should  handle  the  license  application  and  dispatch  the  application  to  the  ap-
propriate agency for a decision;
• Maintaining timetables for decision-making on license applications so that ap-
• Receiving  decisions  on  applications  from  the  designated  agencies  and  distrib-
• Receiving appeals of licensing decisions and petitions for review of sunset deci-
• Maintaining timetables for decisions on appeal;
• Receiving  decisions  on  appeals  and  distributing  these  decisions  to  applicants;
• Providing  administrative  support  to  the  appellate  panel  (see  description
• Monitoring and oversight of the sunset process.

sions, and delivering these to the appellate panel (see description below);

uting these decisions to applicants;

below); and

D. Establish an independent export license appeals panel to hear and decide disputes
about  whether  export  licenses  are  required,  whether  particular  decisions  to  grant  or
deny  licenses  were  made  properly,  and  whether  sunset  requirements  have  been  car-
ried  out  properly.  An  independent,  neutral  decision-making  authority  is  required  to
break  the  logjams  in  the  system  caused  by  philosophical  differences  and  varying  in-
terpretations  of  statutory,  regulatory,  and  executive  order  language.  Two  kinds  of
issues  can  be  resolved  quickly  and  effectively  using  an  appellate  decision-making
panel:

• First,  if  the  agency  makes  a  decision  (either  requiring  or  not  requiring  a  li-
cense),  and  a  party  or  a  government  agency  believes  the  matter  was  wrongly
decided, there is an avenue to resolve these differences.
• Second, if the agency fails to remove an item or category of items from the con-
trol  list  under  the  sunset  requirement,  or  does  not  act  at  all  within  the  one-
year  time  period  for  review  of  each  item  on  the  list,  an  affected  party  could
appeal either to reverse the agency’s determination, or to require the agency to
act in a timely way to make the necessary determination.

The  committee  recommends  that  an  independent  export  license  appeals  panel  be
constituted, appointed by the President or the National Security Advisor Panel mem-
bers would serve a five-year term. [NB: It is at times difficult to get presidential ac-
tion  on  appointments  in  a  timely  way,  particularly  at  the  beginning  of  an  adminis-
tration  when  there  are  many  competing  concerns.  For  that  reason,  the  President’s
Executive Order would allow 90 days from the date of issuance of the Order for the
appointments to be made through the presidential processes, and after that, the ap-
pointments  would  be  made  by  the  Chief  Judge  of  the  Federal  Court  of  Appeals  for
the  District  of  Columbia  Circuit  within  30  days.  Replacement  judges  would  be  se-
lected  in  the  same  way.  No  Senate  confirmation  would  be  required  because  this  is
not  a  ‘‘court’’;  it  is  an  administrative  panel  assembled  by  the  President  to  assist
agencies  in  carrying  out  their  responsibilities.  This  panel  makes  decisions  among
competing  interests  of  agencies  the  same  way  the  National  Security  Council’s  staff

housed,  for  administrative  purposes,  under  the  same  organizational  umbrella.  Ap-
peals panels such as this one are not ‘‘directed’’ by an administrative authority. This
kind  of  panel  acts  independently  and  neutrally  to  resolve  disputes.  It  has  no  oper-
ational responsibility other than to hear disputes and issue opinions.

The  best  organizational  home  for  the  proposed  coordinating  center  and  the  export
license  appeals  panel  would  be  within  the  National  Security  Council  structure,  with
the coordinating center’s director reporting directly to the National Security Adviser.
This  placement  in  the  White  House  structure  will  ensure  the  coordinating  center’s
independence  and  will  establish  its  relationship  to  the  President.  The  coordinating
center  and  the  export  license  appeals  panel  would  not  necessarily  be  co-located  with
the NSC. This would not be required for an effective exercise of its powers under the
Executive Order.

The  committee  weighed  several  options  before  making  the  recommendation  for  a
new coordinating center and an export license appeals panel and locating them with-
in  the  NSC.  The  option  to  create  an  interagency  group  was  rejected  because  experi-
ence supports the conclusion that this would devolve into just another debating soci-
ety and would not constitute a practical means to improve the present export control
system.  The  option  to  use  a  group  made  up  of  private  sector  members  was  rejected
because that alternative would not be acceptable to the government agencies involved.
The  option  to  place  this  responsibility  with  the  Department  of  Defense  was  rejected,
because  the  department,  through  its  management  of  the  Militarily  Critical  Tech-
nologies  List,  is  an  important  player  in  the  export  control  regime.  Similarly,  any
placement within any other cabinet-level department involved in licensing would also
compromise  the  independence  of  the  proposed  center.  The  option  to  place  these  ad-
ministrative functions in the Office of Management and Budget was also considered.
Although  neither  the  National  Security  Council  nor  the  Office  of  Management  and
Budget is an operational agency, the committee thinks that the NSC provides the bet-
ter fit, because of its focus on national security and economic policy. In addition, the
chain  of  command  would  have  the  coordinating  center’s  director  reporting  directly
to the National Security Advisor. This would not only signify the importance of these
issues,  in  terms  of  both  national  security  and  economic  policy,  it  would  also  serves
as a brake on the director in terms of choosing his or her battles carefully.
Recommendation  2.  The  President  should  direct  that  executive  authorities  under
the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act be administered to
assure the scientific and technological competitiveness of the United States, which is
a prerequisite for both national security and economic prosperity.

Action Items
A.  Maintain  the  Fundamental  Research  Exemption  that  protects  unclassified  re-
search,  as  provided  by  National  Security  Decision  Directive  189,  and  ensure  that  it
is properly implemented.
B.  Create  an  economic  competitiveness  exemption  that  eliminates  export  controls  on
dual-use technologies where they, or their functional equivalents, are available with-
out restriction in open markets outside the United States.
Recommendation 3. The President should maintain and enhance access to the res-
ervoir  of  human  talent  from  foreign  sources  to  strengthen  the  U.S.  science  and  tech-
nology  base.  Traditionally,  the  United  States  had  to  worry  about  science  and  tech-
nology flowing out of the country. In today’s conditions, the U.S. must make sure that
advanced science and technology will continue to flow into the country. For this rea-
son, the U.S. visa regulations as applied to credentialed foreign scientists should en-
sure that the U.S. has access to the best talent. Science and engineering degree hold-
ers who prefer, after graduation, to work in the U.S. should have ready access to per-
mission for long-term stays. Granting this access for highly trained technical and sci-
entific  personnel  is  an  important  way  of  augmenting  a  critical  segment  of  the  work-
force. The U.S. cannot protect U.S. jobs by denying entry to foreign professionals; jobs
will  simply  go  abroad.  It  is  important  for  both  the  national  security  and  economic
prosperity to maintain the flow of human talent into the United States.

Action Items
A.  Streamline  the  visa  process  for  credentialed  short-term  visitors  in  science  and
technology fields.

The committee recommends the President’s Executive Order require that a non-im-
migrant visa applicant who is a graduate student, researcher, or professional in any
field of science or technology and whose application is supported by a qualified uni-
versity,  scientific  body,  or  corporation  should  receive  a  determination  on  his  or  her

visa application within 30 days. This will allow access for credentialed academic re-
searchers  to  work  with  U.S.-based  colleagues  and  in  U.S.-based  programs,  and  will
facilitate work done in U.S. science laboratories.
B. Extend the duration of stay for science and engineering graduates with advanced
degrees.

The  committee  recommends  the  President’s  Executive  Order  provide  a  one-year
automatic  visa  extension  to  international  students  to  remain  in  the  United  States  to
seek  employment  or  acceptance  into  further  advanced  study  on  receipt  of  advanced
degrees  in  science,  technology,  engineering,  mathematics,  or  other  fields  of  national
need  at  qualified  U.S.  institutions.  If  these  students  are  offered  jobs  by  U.S.-based
employers  and  pass  security  screening  measures,  they  should  be  provided  automatic
work permits and expedited residence status. If students are unable to obtain employ-
ment within one year, their visas would expire.
C.  Include  expert  vouching  by  qualified  U.S.  scientists  in  the  non-immigrant  visa
process for well known scholars and researchers.

The  committee  recommends  that  the  President’s  Executive  Order  allow  qualified
U.S.  scientists,  as  part  of  the  visa  application  process,  to  vouch  for  the  technical
credibility  and  legitimacy  of  visa  applicants  who  are  in  the  same  or  in  a  similar
field. A more interactive application review procedure would permit those with exper-
tise in relevant scientific and technology fields (and personal knowledge of the exper-
tise  of  the  individual  whose  application  is  being  reviewed)  to  aid  consular  officials
in accurately and efficiently determining the existence of a real security threat.
D. Institute skills-based preferential processing with respect to visa applications.

The  committee  recommends  that  the  President’s  Executive  Order  institute  a  new
skills-based, preferential processing with respect to visa applications. The visa appli-
cations of scientists and engineers should be given priority. Graduate-level education
and  science  and  engineering  skills  should  substantially  raise  an  applicant’s  chances
and confer priority in obtaining residence permits and U.S. citizenship.

In Conclusion

As a nation, we cannot, and should not abandon well-conceived efforts to keep dan-
gerous  technology  and  scientific  know-how  out  of  the  hands  of  those  who  would  use
this  knowledge  to  create  weapons  of  mass  destruction  and  other,  equally  dangerous
military  systems.  However,  these  represent  a  very  narrow  and  limited  set  of  goods,
technology, and knowledge. Our former unilateral strategy of containment and isola-
tion of our adversaries is, under current conditions, a self-destructive strategy for ob-
solescence  and  declining  economic  competitiveness.  A  strategy  of  international  en-
gagement is a path to prosperity that can be coupled with a smarter approach to se-
curity  using  an  adaptive  system  of  government  regulation  and  incentives.  The  com-
mittee  recommends  the  issuance  of  an  Executive  Order  that  implements  the  rec-
ommendations it has outlined as one of the first orders of business in January 2009.’’

Chair  GORDON.  This  hearing  will  come  to  order,  and  good  morn-
ing. Welcome to today’s hearing entitled the Impacts of U.S. Export
Control  Policies  on  Science  Technology  Activity  and  Competitive-
ness. I would like to begin by welcoming our panel of distinguished
witnesses and look forward to your testimony. And let me just put
everyone  on  notice  that  General  Scowcroft,  who  is  an  important
part  of  this  panel,  is  immortal  and  he  got  stuck  in  the  long  lines.
And we tried to in respect to those folks who are here on time, get
started on time, and as he comes in, he will join us welcomely and
discreetly. And so we will just let everyone know that.

The  Nation’s  export  controls  system  and  the  related  Inter-
national  Traffic  in  Arms  Regulations,  also  known  as  ITAR,  were
put into place to help protect America’s sensitive technologies from
falling  into  the  hands  of  those  who  might  do  harm  to  this  nation.
In short, the export controls were supposed to strengthen our na-

tional security.

However, in recent years there has been a growing chorus of con-
cern about some of the unintended consequences of the current sys-
tem  of  export  controls  for  both  the  Nation’s  competitiveness  in  the
global  economy  and  for  the  Nation’s  science  and  technology  enter-
prise.

Equally  troubling,  there  are  also  increasing  expressions  of  con-
cern  from  experts  in  the  national  security  industry  and  academic
communities to the effect that the current system of export controls
is  actually  weakening  our  national  security,  not  strengthening  it,
while  undermining  the  health  of  our  science  and  technology  enter-
prise.

In that regard, let me quote from the recent National Academies
report  authored  by  a  distinguished  panel  under  the  co-chairman-
ship  of  Gen.  Scowcroft,  one  of  witnesses  at  today’s  hearing,  and  I
quote:  ‘‘The  national  security  controls  that  regulate  access  to  and
export  of  science  and  technology  are  broken.  As  currently  struc-
tured,  many  of  these  controls  undermine  our  national  and  home-
land  security  and  stifle  American  engagement  in  the  global  econ-
omy,  and  in  science  and  technology.  Fixing  these  controls  does  not
mean  putting  an  end  to  them,  but  implementing  reforms  based  on
the realities of the risks and opportunities of today’s threats to our
nation.’’

The  panel  then  goes  on  to  make  an  equally  sobering  statement,
and  once  again  I  quote:  ‘‘The  export  controls  and  visa  regulations
that  were  crafted  to  meet  conditions  the  United  States  faced  over
five  decades  ago  now  quietly  undermine  our  national  security  and
our national economic well-being.’’

Those  are  very  serious  statements  from  a  group  of  very  knowl-
edgeable  individuals,  and  I  think  that  they  warrant  our  close  con-
sideration.

In  addition,  there  have  been  a  growing  number  of  reports  that
have  focused  on  the  impact  of  the  current  export  controls  regime
on  America’s  civil  and  commercial  space  programs  and  space  re-
search activities.

Those reports have also reached some of the same troubling con-

clusions.

For  example,  the  Center  for  Strategic  and  International  Studies
Working  Group  on  the  Health  of  the  U.S.  Space  Industrial  Base

and  the  Impact  of  Export  Controls,  which  was  co-chaired  by  an-
other one of our witnesses today, Thomas Young, quoted, and again
I  will  quote:  ‘‘The  current  export  control  policy  is  constricting  U.S.
engagement  and  partnerships  with  the  rest  of  the  global  space
community,  and  is  feeding  a  growing  separation  between  the  U.S.
space community and an emerging non-U.S. space community.’’

And they go further to say, ‘‘Export controls are adversely affect-
ing  U.S.  companies’  ability  to  compete  for  foreign  space  business,
particularly  the  second  and  third  tier.  And  it  is  the  second  and
third tier of the industry that is the source of much innovation, and
is  normally  the  most  engaged  in  the  global  market  place  in  the
aerospace/defense sector.’’

Findings  such  as  those  led  this  committee  last  year  to  include  a
provision  in  the  House-passed  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2008  di-
recting  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy
to carry out a comprehensive study of the impact of current export
control policies on our civil and commercial aerospace enterprise.

While  that  provision  did  not  make  it  into  the  final  public  law,  I
am  encouraged  that  President  Obama  called  for  a  similar  review
during  his  Presidential  campaign,  and  I  am  optimistic  that  such  a
study will be initiated and I will be in written contact with the Ad-
ministration making that request.

In  closing,  I  think  that  it  is  time  for  Congress  to  take  another
look  at  the  Nation’s  export  controls  regime  to  ensure  that  it  is
working effectively and without unintended adverse impacts.

As part of that look, we want to understand any negative effects
that  the  current  export  controls  regime  may  be  having  on  our  ef-
forts  to  stimulate  the  economy  and  promote  long-term  growth
through the investment of science and technology.

This  committee  is  starting  the  process  with  today’s  hearing,  and
I hope and anticipate that other committees will be following up in
the  coming  weeks  and  months  with  further  oversight  of  other  as-
pects of the export controls issue.

With  that,  I  again  welcome  our  witnesses,  and  I  will  now  turn
to  my  friend,  Mr.  Hall,  for  any  opening  remarks  that  he  cares  to
make.

[The prepared statement of Chair Gordon follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIR BART GORDON

I would like to begin by welcoming our panel of witnesses to this morning’s hear-

ing. We look forward to your testimony.

The Nation’s export controls system and the related International Traffic in Arms
Regulations—also  known  as  ITAR—were  put  into  place  to  help  protect  America’s
sensitive  technologies  from  falling  into  the  hands  of  those  who  might  do  harm  to
this nation.

In  short,  export  controls  were  supposed  to  help  strengthen  our  national  security.
However, in recent years there has been a growing chorus of concern about some
of the unintended consequences of the current system of export controls for both the
Nation’s  competitiveness  in  the  global  economy  and  for  the  Nation’s  science  and
technology enterprise.

Equally  troubling,  there  are  also  increasing  expressions  of  concern  from  experts
in the national security, industrial, and academic communities to the effect that the
current  system  of  export  controls  is  actually  weakening  our  national  security—not
strengthening it—while undermining the health of our science and technology enter-
prise.

In that regard, let me quote from the recent National Academies report authored
by  a  distinguished  panel  under  the  co-chairmanship  of  Gen.  Scowcroft,  one  of  wit-
nesses at today’s hearing:

‘‘The  national  security  controls  that  regulate  access  to  and  export  of  science  and
technology are broken. As currently structured, many of these controls undermine
our national and homeland security and stifle American engagement in the glob-
al economy, and in science and technology.
Fixing  these  controls  does  not  mean  putting  an  end  to  them,  but  implementing
reforms  based  on  the  realities  of  the  risks  and  opportunities  of  today’s  threats
to the Nation.’’

The panel then goes on to make an equally sobering statement:

‘‘The  export  controls  and  visa  regulations  that  were  crafted  to  meet  conditions
the  United  States  faced  over  five  decades  ago  now  quietly  undermine  our  na-
tional security and our national economic well-being.’’

Those are serious statements from a group of very knowledgeable individuals, and

I thus think that they warrant our close attention.

In  addition,  there  have  been  a  growing  number  of  reports  that  have  focused  on
the  impact  of  the  current  export  controls  regime  on  America’s  civil  and  commercial
space programs and space research activities.

Those reports have also reached some troubling conclusions.
For  example,  the  Center  for  Strategic  and  International  Studies  Working  Group
on the Health of the U.S. Space Industrial Base and the Impact of Export Controls,
which  was  co-chaired  by  another  of  today’s  witnesses,  Thomas  Young,  found  that:
‘‘The  current  export  control  policy  is  constricting  U.S.  engagement  and  partner-
ship with the rest of the global space community, and is feeding a growing sepa-
ration between the U.S. space community and an emerging non-U.S. space com-
munity.’’

And

‘‘Export  controls  are  adversely  affecting  U.S.  companies’  ability  to  compete  for
foreign  space  business,  particularly  the  second  and  third  tier.  And  it  is  the  sec-
ond/third tier of the industry that is the source of much innovation, and is nor-
mally the most engaged in the global market place in the aerospace/defense sec-
tor.’’

Findings  such  as  those  led  this  committee  last  year  to  include  a  provision  in  the
House-passed  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2008  directing  the  Director  of  the  Office
of  Science  and  Technology  Policy  to  carry  out  a  comprehensive  study  of  the  impact
of  current  export  control  policies  on  our  civil  and  commercial  aerospace  activities.
While  that  provision  did  not  make  it  into  the  final  public  law,  I  am  encouraged
that  President  Obama  called  for  a  similar  review  during  his  Presidential  campaign
and I am thus optimistic that such a study will be initiated.

In closing, I think that it is time for Congress to take another look at the Nation’s
export  controls  regime  to  ensure  that  it  is  working  effectively  and  without  unin-
tended adverse impacts.

As part of that look, we want to understand any negative effects that the current
export  controls  regime  may  be  having  on  our  efforts  to  stimulate  the  economy  and
promote long-term growth through investments in science and technology.

This committee is starting the process with today’s hearing on the current export
controls’  impacts  on  science  and  technology,  and  I  hope  and  anticipate  that  other
committees will be following up in the coming weeks and months with further over-
sight of other aspects of the export controls issue.

With that, I again want to welcome our witnesses, and I will now turn to Mr. Hall

for any opening remarks he would care to make.

Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chair,  thank  you.  I  will  skip  over  the  paragraph
where I brag on you for a couple of three minutes, and also I won’t
need  to  thank  the  distinguished  panel.  You  have  done  a  good  job
of  that,  but  I  just  want  to  say  that  export  controls  are  crucial  and
necessary  to  prevent  the  proliferation  of  militarily-useful  tech-
nologies  from  falling  into  the  wrong  hands,  and  it  is  critically  im-
portant  that  we  continue,  to  the  best  of  our  abilities,  to  deny  the
transfer of these technologies to our adversaries.

In  today’s  global  marketplace,  as  our  witnesses  will  soon  point
out,  it  is  equally  important  that  export  control  regulations  recog-
nize  technologies  that  are  no  longer  ours  alone  to  control,  and  to

permit  the  rapid  sharing  of  emerging  R&D  technologies  with  our
friends  and  allies.  Based  on  a  number  of  scholarly  studies,  includ-
ing  the  National  Academies’  Beyond  Fortress  America  report,  it  is
clear  to  me  that  the  current  export  control  regime  fails  I  think  to
meet these standards.

Industry  and  academia  endure  enormous  costs  in  an  effort  to
comply  with  ITAR.  The  price  of  direct  compliance  is  fairly  easy  to
calculate,  but  the  more  difficult  cost  is  the  self-imposed  conserv-
atism put into place by industry and academia because they do not
understand  what  is  and  what  is  not  a  violation  of  clear  and  evolv-
ing  standards.  Technology  is  constantly  shifting  the  landscape.
What  is  cutting  edge  today  may  be  outmoded  in  six  months  or  a
year  from  now.  So  too  are  the  threats  posed  by  our  adversaries,
and for that matter, the adversaries themselves.

As  a  consequence  of  these  uncertainties  and  the  lack  of  trans-
parency  within  the  exporting  licensing  bureaus,  industry  and  aca-
demia  are  shying  away  from  bringing  products  and  ideas  into  the
international  arena  or  collaborating  with  our  friends  and  allies.
This  result  is  less  business  and  less  engagement  with  leading  re-
searchers  the  entire  world  over.  It  is,  in  essence,  a  system  that  is
designed  to  slowly  erode  our  technological  superiority  which  we
don’t want.

The current system has no transparency, and as a result, export
licensing is bogging down the very same R&D enterprise that made
our economy the largest in the world.

And as I stated just a moment ago, we have to continue to deny
our  adversaries  access  to  emerging  technologies,  but  I  am  con-
vinced  the  current  export  control  regime  is  working  against  our
own national self-interest.

So  I  am  anxious  to  hear  from  these  gentlemen  who  put  long
hours in taking their time to come before us. I yield back my time.
Yes, I am sorry, Mr. Chair. I yield to the gentleman from California
the remaining time I have which is three or four minutes.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Hall follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RALPH M. HALL

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  calling  today’s  hearing  on  the  implementation  of
the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) program, and the serious, un-
anticipated  consequences  it  has  imposed  on  our  industry,  academia,  national  secu-
rity, and technological readiness.

First  I  want  to  thank  our  distinguished  panel  of  witnesses  for  taking  time  out  of
their  busy  schedules  to  appear  before  the  Committee.  I  know  you  have  put  in  long
hours to prepare for your appearance this morning, and we are grateful for the wis-
dom and insights you bring to today’s discussion.

Mr. Chairman, export controls are crucial and necessary to prevent the prolifera-
tion of militarily-useful technologies from falling into the wrong hands, and it’s criti-
cally  important  that  we  continue,  to  the  best  of  our  abilities,  to  deny  the  transfer
of these technologies to our adversaries.

In  today’s  global  marketplace,  as  our  witnesses  will  soon  point  out,  it’s  equally
important  that  export  control  regulations  recognize  technologies  that  are  no  longer
ours alone to control, and to permit the rapid sharing of emerging R&D technologies
with  our  friends  and  allies.  Based  on  a  number  of  scholarly  studies,  including  the
National Academies’ Beyond Fortress America report, it is clear to me that the cur-
rent export control regime fails to meet these standards.

Industry  and  academia  endure  enormous  costs  in  an  effort  to  comply  with  ITAR.
The price of direct compliance is easy to calculate, but the more difficult cost is the

not understand what is—and is not—a violation of unclear and evolving standards.

outmoded six months or a year from now. So too are the threats posed by our adver-
saries, and for the matter, the adversaries themselves.

26

As  a  consequence  of  these  uncertainties  and  the  lack  of  transparency  within  the
export  licensing  bureaus,  industry  and  academia  are  shying  away  from  bringing
products  and  ideas  into  the  international  arena—or  collaborating  with  our  friends
and allies. The result is less business and less engagement with leading researchers
the world over. It is, in essence, a system that is designed to slowly erode our tech-
nological superiority.

The current system has no transparency, and as a result, export licensing is bog-
ging down the very same R&D enterprise that made our economy the largest in the
world.

As  I  stated  a  moment  ago,  we  must  continue  to  deny  our  adversaries  access  to
emerging  technologies,  but  I  am  convinced  the  current  export  control  regime  is
working against our own national self-interest.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and Rank-
ing  Member  Hall.  Clearly,  America  needs  to  nurture  its  aerospace
and—we  are  going  to  welcome  General  Scowcroft  here.  America
needs  to  nurture  its  aerospace  and  space  technology-related  indus-
tries.  This  is  vital  to  the  security  of  our  country  to  have  these  in-
dustries  on  the  cutting  edge  of  technology  but  also  to  be  competi-
tive  with  their  competition  overseas.  And  everyone  understands
that  there  is  a  big  problem  and  has  been  a  big  problem  for  a  long
time  with  the  ITAR  regulations.  And  everyone  agrees  that  reform
is  needed.  But  we,  when  discussing  this  issue,  need  to  make  sure
that  our  high-tech  exports,  again,  number  one,  the  regulations  are
not  strangling  the  industry  but  at  the  same  time,  these  high-tech
exports are not going to potential enemies of the United States, are
not  going  to  countries  which  proliferate  weapons  of  mass  destruc-
tion in a way that would be detrimental to our security and the se-
curity of other western democracies.

We  know  exactly  who  the  nations  are  that  are  proliferators.  We
also have a good understanding about which nations pose a poten-
tial  threat  to  the  United  States,  who  are  our  potential  enemies
versus  who  are  not  our  potential  enemies.  So  whatever  changes
that  we  enact  into  ITAR  and  other  export  regulations  should  basi-
cally differentiate between the scofflaw and rogue nations or poten-
tial  enemies  on  one  hand  and  those  countries  that  pose  no  threat
to  us  and  in  fact,  the  largest  numbers  of  countries  that  are  just
wishing  to  be  trading  partners.  But  let  us  note,  there  is  a  dif-
ference  between  the  People’s  Republic  of  China,  which  is  the
world’s  worst  human  rights  abuser  and  also  a  potential  enemy  of
the  United  States,  versus  countries  like  Brazil  or  Belgium  or  any
number of other countries that we could name. North Korea is not
equivalent to The Netherlands. Well, neither is the People’s Repub-
lic of China equivalent to India.

Ten  years  ago  the  Cox  Report  clearly  demonstrated  that  U.S.
technology  transfers  to  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  helped  im-
prove and enhance the efficiency of China’s arsenal of missiles that
are  aimed  at  the  United  States.  As  a  consequence,  we  passed  the
Strom  Thurmond  Act  which  established  requirements  that  before
any  satellite  technology  could  be  exported  to  China,  the  President
of  the  United  States  had  to  first  certify  to  Congress  that  the  tech
transfer  was  not  against  our  national  security  interests  or  our  do-
mestic  launch  for  satellite  industries.  Since  the  Strom  Thurmond
Act became law 10 years ago, not a single such certification by the
President  of  the  United  States  has  been  made,  and  as  a  con-

sequence, no western satellite payloads have been flown in Chinese
rockets.  Let  us  note  that  when  we  see  the  progress  that  is  very
clearly now evident in the Chinese rockets and missiles, that could
probably  be  traced  back  to  the  transfer  of  technology  from  the
United  States.  Ironically,  perhaps  even  worse,  tragically,  that
money that was taken from the American taxpayer’s pocket for re-
search  and  missile  technology  has  now  ended  up  in  the  hands  of
not only our competitors, but a potential enemy that aims missiles
at the United States of America.

So just as our Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was visiting the
People’s  Republic  of  China,  let  us  note  that  European  satellite  op-
erator,  Eutelsat,  was  cutting  a  deal  with  Beijing  to  launch  a  sat-
ellite on a Long March rocket. Again, a Long March rocket system
that  benefited  greatly  in  its  development  from  the  technology
transfer from the United States two decades ago.

Incidentally, the Eutel Satellite Corporation, these satellites also
make  millions  of  dollars  worth  of  profit  from  selling  satellite  serv-
ices  to  the  United  States  Government  through  defense  contracts.
These  things  are  vitally  important,  but  Mr.  Chair,  as  we  discuss
this  issue,  I  hope  that  we  keep  in  mind  the  history  of  this  issue
as  well  as  the  potential  problems  that  lie  ahead  and  not  simply
look  about  the  aerospace  industry  and  technology  today  but  where
America will be in the future. Thank you very much.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Rohrabacher follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE DANA ROHRABACHER

Mr. Chairman:

America  needs  a  vibrant  Aerospace  and  Space  Technology  industry.  Everyone
agrees ITAR reform needs to happen. We need to make sure that our high tech ex-
perts aren’t strangled by regulations. On the other hand, we need to remain vigilant
that  our  advanced  technology  doesn’t  end  up  in  the  hands  of  potential  enemies  or
nations  which  proliferate  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  We  know  exactly  which  na-
tions these are, and we must make absolutely sure that whatever changes we enact
to  ITAR  and  other  export  regulations,  that  these  scofflaw  and  rogue  nations  are
barred  from  receiving  our  high  tech  systems.  Chief  among  them  is  the  Peoples  Re-
public of China.

Ten years ago, the Cox Report clearly demonstrated that U.S. technology transfers
to  the  Peoples  Republic  of  China  helped  to  improve  and  enhance  the  efficiency  of
China’s arsenal of missiles that were aimed at us. As a consequence, we passed the
Strom  Thurmond  Act,  which  established  the  requirement  that  before  any  satellite
technology  could  be  exported  to  China,  the  President  of  the  United  States  had  to
first certify to Congress that the tech transfer was not inimical to our national secu-
rity  or  our  domestic  launch  or  satellite  industries.  Since  the  Strom  Thurmond  Act
became law 10 years ago, not a single such certification has been made by any Ad-
ministration, and as a consequence no Western satellite payload has flown on a Chi-
nese rocket.

But  the  resolve  of  the  Obama  Administration  is  now  being  tested  in  this  area.
Just  as  our  Secretary  of  State,  Hillary  Clinton  was  visiting  the  Peoples  Republic  of
China,  European  satellite  operator  Eutelsat  was  cutting  a  deal  with  Beijing  for  a
launch  on  a  Long  March  rocket.  Incidentally,  Eutelsat  sells  tens  of  millions  of  dol-
lars  worth  of  satellite  services  to  the  U.S.  Government  through  DISA  contracts.
Clearly, this is the beginning of a game of chicken between Eutelsat and the Obama
Administration.  If  the  Obama  Administration  does  nothing,  the  message  is  clear:
transferring technology to proliferators of weapons of mass destruction like the Peo-
ples Republic of China is a perfectly acceptable business model. Surely we can make
sensible  changes  to  ITAR  and  other  export  regulations,  but  we  must  not  go  so  far
as to make them at the expense of our national security. Let us reward our friends
with  openness  in  trade;  and  conversely  let  us  be  as  single-minded  as  possible  in
stopping  items  from  the  United  States  Munitions  List—like  Eutelsat  payloads—
from falling into the hands of the Peoples Republic of China and other proliferators.

Chair  GORDON.  Thank  you.  If  there  are  Members  who  wish  to

your statements will be added to the record at this point.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Thank  you,  Chairman  Gordon,  for  convening  this  hearing  on  U.S.  export  control
policies  and  continuing  to  keep  this  committee’s  focus  on  our  nation’s  technological
competitiveness in a global market.

This  committee  has  held  numerous  hearings  on  global  competitiveness  in  the
science  and  technology  fields  and  recently  spent  a  great  deal  of  effort  on  the  COM-
PETES  Act,  which  commits  a  renewed  investment  into  our  children’s  education  in
math  and  science.  During  the  last  session  of  Congress,  this  committee  heard  from
Bill Gates, Chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, on the many obstacles that face
a  hi-tech  giant  due  to  this  country’s  falling  position  in  the  global  competitive  mar-
ket.

Despite the work of this committee to pass the COMPETES Act and other federal
investments  in  research  and  development  initiatives,  our  national  security  controls
on science and technology remain so antiquated that they severely restrict commer-
cial and academic innovation in these fields. If our scientists cannot share informa-
tion,  cannot  receive  licenses,  cannot  expand  their  field  of  research  because  of  gov-
ernment restrictions in the name of national security, no amount of investment dol-
lars will allow this country to regain its competitive edge in the global marketplace.
I  look  forward  to  a  constructive  dialogue  on  this  issue  and  the  recently  released
report, Beyond ‘‘Fortress America’’: National Security Controls on Science and Tech-
nology in a Globalized World. Thank you, Mr. Chairman for your leadership of this
committee and for my time, I yield back.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Good morning, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member.
Today’s  hearing  on  exports  controls  has  significant  impacts  on  the  space  and  de-

counts for more than 16,000 jobs.

When  the  economic  multiplier  effect  of  these  jobs  is  considered,  the  total  impact
from the space center and Texas exceeds more than 26,000 employees with personal
incomes of more than $2.5 billion; and total spending exceeds $3.5 billion.

Truly,  the  space  and  aeronautics  industries  have  dynamic  and  broad  based  im-
pacts  on  the  economic,  educational  and  quality  of  life  on  the  entire  State  of  Texas.
NASA provides $72 million for grants and contracts to Texas universities and col-

leges as well as $44 million to Texas non-profit organizations.
NASA is so important for our nation and the State of Texas.
Since  the  Cold  War,  investments  in  NASA  and  other  agencies  have  created  a  ro-
bust  science  and  engineering  workforce,  driven  innovation,  fueled  economic  growth,
and established the United States’ preeminence in science and technology.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  will  be  interested  to  know  whether  America’s  friends  and  allies
perceive  a  climate  of  export  controls  that  is  conducive  for  long-term  international
collaborations to expand human and robotic presence in the solar system.

I would like to welcome all of today’s witnesses.
It is my hope that they can help the Committee assess the implications and unin-
tended  consequences  of  current  export  control  policies  for  the  conduct  of  United
States Government science and technology activities.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE GABRIELLE GIFFORDS

29

I  want  to  thank  our  distinguished  witnesses  for  appearing  here  today  to  share
their  insights  on  a  very  important  topic—the  impacts  of  our  export  control  system
on  U.S.  science  and  technology  activities  and  competitiveness.  Export  control  is  not
a subject that Americans discuss at the dinner table, but it is something that affects
every American, because the intent of the policies is to help protect the Nation from
harm.

Today,  our  witnesses  will  shed  light  on  the  importance  of  science  and  technology
to  our  economic  and  national  security  and  on  the  need  to  ensure  that  the  Nation’s
export control policies and procedures do not inadvertently undermine that security
as  well  as  weaken  our  competitiveness  in  science  and  technology  in  a  very  chal-
lenging  global  economy.  In  that  regard,  I  am  especially  interested  our  witnesses’
perspectives  on  the  implications  of  current  U.S.  export  control  policies  for  our  na-
tion’s  civil  and  commercial  space  activities,  because  many  of  the  technologies  and
information involved in space activities are regulated by export control policies.

Space is increasingly a global undertaking, with new space-faring nations emerg-
ing that will provide both competition and opportunities for cooperation in the com-
ing  years.  As  a  study  of  the  Center  for  Strategic  and  International  Studies  noted,
‘‘Other  space-faring  nations  continue  to  make  strides  whether  they  have  access  to
U.S.  technology  or  not’’  and  ‘‘United  States  preeminence  in  space  is  under  challenge
in  many  areas.’’  We  need  to  make  sure  that  our  export  control  policies  are  struc-
tured to enable us to meet that challenge while still protecting our legitimate secu-
rity needs.

I am particularly concerned about the challenges that current export control poli-
cies  present  to  the  effective  conduct  of  fundamental  space  research.  According  to  a
National  Academies  workshop  summary  on  space  science  and  the  International
Traffic  in  Arms  Regulations  (ITAR),  some  researchers  report  that  ITAR  makes  it
difficult to develop space research projects, which are typically conducted in partner-
ship with industry, government labs, and international institutions. Some research-
ers are also uncertain about whether they can discuss their research in a university
classroom that includes non-U.S. students. Our universities are a significant source
of  innovation  for  our  science  and  technology  enterprise,  for  our  space  program,  and
for  our  economic  strength.  I  think  it  is  important  that  we  look  carefully  at  the  im-
pacts of current U.S. export controls policies on our universities and take whatever
steps are appropriate to mitigate the unintended consequences.

In closing, I am pleased that the Science and Technology Committee is taking the
lead in addressing these important issues. I hope that this hearing will be the first
step in a thorough review of our current export control system by Congress, includ-
ing  the  House  Armed  Services  and  House  Foreign  Affairs  Committees  on  which  I
also serve and which have important oversight and legislative roles to play with re-
gard to these issues.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Mitchell follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE HARRY E. MITCHELL

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Today we will review the impacts of current export control policies on U.S. science

and technology activities and competitiveness.

As  we  addressed  last  year  with  the  America  COMPETES  Act,  it  is  critical  to  en-
sure that our nation is prepared to lead in science and technology in an increasingly
globalized economy.

However,  export  control  policies,  which  were  established  decades  ago,  fail  to  con-

sider the present-day realities of a global economy.

As  the  National  Academies  report,  Beyond  ‘‘Fortress  America’’:  National  Security
Controls on Science and Technology in a Globalized World states, ‘‘the export control
system  enforced  in  the  U.S.  today  has  failed  to  evolve  with  changing  global  condi-
tions  and  now  produces  significant  harm  to  U.S.  military  capability,  to  homeland
security, and to the Nation’s economic competitiveness.’’

While  we  work  to  establish  export  control  policies  that  reflect  present  day  reali-
ties,  we  must  also  be  careful  to  ensure  that  these  policies  continue  to  protect  U.S.
national security.

I look forward to hearing more from our witnesses on the commercial and national

security concerns related current export control policies.

Chair  GORDON.  At  this  time,  I  would  like  to  introduce  our  wit-
nesses.  First  up  we  have  Lieutenant  General  Brent  Scowcroft  who
is  the  Co-Chair  of  the  National  Academies  Committee  on  Science

Security  and  Prosperity  and  former  National  Security  Advisor  for
Presidents  Gerald  Ford  and  George  H.  W.  Bush.  And  General
Scowcroft,  I  had  a  sick  daughter  and  got  caught  in  traffic  this
morning,  so  I  was  late  for  my  first  meeting.  They  couldn’t  start
without me, but we could start without you. And so we didn’t think
you  would  mind.  Mr.  Thomas  Young  is  the  Co-Chair  of  the  Center
for  Strategic  and  International  Studies  Working  Group  on  the
health of the U.S. Space Industrial Base and the Impact of Export
Controls.  Dr.  Claude  Canizares  is  the  Vice  President  for  Research
and  Associate  Provost  and  the  Bruno  Rossi  Professor  of  Physics  at
the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology,  MIT.  And  finally,  we
have Major General Robert Dickman who is the Executive Director
for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

As  our  witnesses  should  know,  you  each  have  five  minutes  for
your  spoken  testimony.  Your  written  testimony  will  be  included  in
the record for the hearing, and when you have completed your spo-
ken testimony, we will begin our questions. Each Member then will
have  five  minutes  for  their  questions.  As  the  former  Chair  Sherry
Boehlert  used  to  frequently  say,  although  we  have  five  minutes,
this is a very important issue and we do not want you to feel that
you have to cut off mid-sentence. So we do want to hear from you.

So we will start with Lieutenant General Scowcroft.

STATEMENT  OF  LIEUTENANT  GENERAL  BRENT  SCOWCROFT
(USAF,  RET.),  PRESIDENT  AND  FOUNDER,  THE  SCOWCROFT
GROUP
Lieutenant  General  SCOWCROFT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.
Chair,  Mr.  Hall,  Members  of  the  Committee.  I  appreciate  the  op-
portunity  to  appear  before  you  as  a  Co-Chair  of  the  National  Re-
search Council’s Committee on Science, Security and Prosperity.

The  study  we  have  done  on  export  controls  and  technology  in  a
globalized  world  concludes  that  the  national  security  controls  on
science  and  technology  are  broken.  They  harm  our  national  secu-
rity and reduce our economic competitiveness. These controls which
were  established  during  the  Cold  War  work  well  as  long  as  three
conditions  prevail.  The  U.S.  science  and  technology  establishment
has only one significant competitor, the Soviet Union, and that was
a  weak  competitor.  Two,  military  research  and  development  pro-
duction  took  place  separately  from  the  commercial  sector  and  gen-
erally  led  it  by  a  great  degree.  And  third,  a  common  sense  of  pur-
pose  existed  among  the  United  States  and  its  allies  regarding  the
nature of the threat.

These three conditions no longer obtain. First, the United States
has  competition  in  most  areas  of  advanced  research  and  develop-
ment,  including  military-related  science  and  technology.  The  num-
ber  of  access  points  to  advanced  science  and  technology  has  grown
considerably  and  perhaps  more  to  the  point,  outside  the  control  of
the United States.

Second,  most  military  production  in  the  United  States  is  now
commercially based, thus blurring the distinction between commer-
cial  grade  and  weapons  grade  for  thousands  of  so-called  dual-use
goods  and  technologies.  And  third,  the  alliance  has  lost  its  Cold
War  consensus.  As  a  result,  we  are  not  hurting  ourselves  both  in
terms of science and technology and economic competitiveness.

The  Fortress  America  approach  of  current  controls  cuts  us  off
from information and technologies that we need for our national se-
curity.

There is clearly a better way to manage the application of Amer-
ican science and technology abroad that protects our national secu-
rity  and  our  competitiveness.  We  need  to  change  the  mindset,  and
we need an agile system of security controls that can adapt quickly
to the changing political and technological landscapes. Our mindset
is  now  negative.  Don’t  let  anything  out  which  might  be  of  use
abroad or don’t let any H–1 visa applicants in who might be a prob-
lem.  We  need  to  turn  to  an  open  mindset.  Export  unless  there  is
a reason not to. Let H–1 visa applicants in unless there is a reason
not  to.  And  to  improve  our  ability,  the  committee  recommends  the
establishment  of  two  administrative  entities,  perhaps  within  the
National Security Council. The first would be a coordinating center
for export controls that would be a one-stop shop for people seeking
export  licenses.  This  would  determine  whether  the  Commerce  De-
partment  or  the  State  Department  should  handle  the  application.
Now,  the  applicant  has  to  decide,  and  if  he  guesses  wrong,  there
is  months  of  delay  in  determining  it.  The  second  entity  is  an  ap-
peals panel that would hear and decide disputes about whether ex-
port licenses are required and whether particular decisions to grant
or  deny  those  licenses  were  properly  made  and  also  hear  appeals
on  sunset  requirements  and  how  they  are  being  carried  out.  Our
committee  proposes  that  sunset  requirements  be  applied  to  all
items on the export control list and reviewed annually.

Another  recommendation  dealing  with  the  mindset  proposes  the
administration of existing export control statutes should assure the
science  and  technological  competitiveness  of  the  United  States  as
a prerequisite to both national security and economic prosperity. To
assure  the  conditions  for  scientific  and  technological  competitive-
ness,  the  committee  has  recommended  that  the  fundamental  re-
search exemption, also known as NSDD–189 should be maintained
and properly implemented.

The  committee  also  proposes  the  establishment  of  an  economic
competitiveness exemption that eliminates export controls on dual-
use  technologies  where  they  or  their  functional  equivalent  are
available  without  restriction  in  open  markets  outside  the  United
States.

The  final  recommendation  addresses  the  need  to  maintain  and
enhance  access  to  the  reservoir  of  human  talent  from  foreign
sources through H–1 visas to strengthen the U.S. science and tech-
nology  base.  The  committee  recommends  that  the  President  issue
an  executive  order  to  put  these  provisions  into  effect.  This  order
would not and cannot contravene current law, rather it would gov-
ern the exercise of Presidential authorities established under exist-
ing law. The executive order would not affect anything that is pro-
tected  by  the  national  security  classification  system,  nor  would  it
address export controls that the State Department imposes strictly
on foreign policy grounds. As a first step in overhauling the overall
system of controls, putting these provisions into effect would create
a  record  and  experience  base  that  the  Congress  can  evaluate  and
modify  as  it  sees  fit  at  such  time  as  new  export  control  legislation
can be successfully addressed.

Perhaps  the  most  significant  challenge  to  implementing  these
recommendations  is  to  help  the  relevant  agencies  understand  that
these reforms will not micro-manage their own licensing procedures
or challenge agency expertise.

In  closing,  I  am  grateful  for  the  interest  that  the  Committee  on
Science  and  Technology  has  taken  in  this  report  and  hope  that
your  Members  will  continue  to  be  involved  in  this  issue.  Thank
you, Mr. Chair.

rity Controls on Science and Technology in a Globalized World.

The  national  security  controls  on  science  and  technology  are  broken.  They  were
established  during  the  Cold  War  to  help  maintain  the  United  States’  superiority  in
military-related science and technology. These controls worked fairly well as long as
the following three conditions held:
(1)  The  U.S.  S&T  establishment  had  only  one  significant  competitor—and  we  knew
that  they  had  a  weak  R&D  base.  This  meant  that  we  did  not  have  to  look  much
beyond ourselves to find the most advanced S&T. (2) Military research, development
and production took place separately from the commercial sector. Thus denying the
transfer  of  military  goods  did  not  affect  the  commercial  economy.  (3)  A  common
sense  of  purpose  existed  among  the  United  States  and  its  allies  regarding  the  na-
ture  of  the  threat  and  the  means  to  manage  it;  thus  the  West  was  largely  unified
about denying weapons-grade materials and technologies to its adversaries.

These  three  conditions  no  longer  obtain.  First,  today  the  United  States  has  com-
petition in most areas of advanced research and development, including military-re-
lated  S&T.  Advances  in  science  and  technology  now  occur  throughout  Europe,  in
Russia and Japan, and also in the developing economies of China, India and Brazil.
Thus  the  number  of  access  points  to  advanced  science  and  technology  have  grown
considerably and perhaps more to the point, outside the control of the United States.
Second, most military production in the U.S. is now commercially based, thus blur-
ring  the  distinction  between  commercial  grade  and  weapons  grade  for  thousands  of
so called ‘‘dual-use’’ goods and technologies. And third, the Western alliance has lost
its  Cold  War  consensus;  NATO  member  countries  and  Japan  no  longer  agree  on
what  countries  need  to  be  controlled,  what  items  should  be  controlled,  and  what
kinds  of  controls  are  needed.  Together,  these  changes  make  it  much  more  difficult
for  the  United  States  to  successfully  control  the  transfer  of  goods  and  technologies
that have both commercial and military applications. As a result, many national se-
curity  controls  on  science  and  technology  no  longer  work  in  the  ways  they  were  in-
tended. We endanger our own national security in thinking that unilaterally control-
ling dual-use items here prevents others from obtaining them elsewhere.

Because  science  and  technology  research,  development  and  production  have  be-
come  a  global  enterprise,  the  ‘‘Fortress  America’’  approach  of  current  controls  cuts
us  off  from  information  and  technologies  that  we  need  for  our  national  security.  If
we  sustain  these  export  control  and  visa  barriers,  we  will  increasingly  lose  touch
with  the  cutting  edge  of  science  and  technology,  and  we  risk  missing  emerging  na-
tional security threats.

Following  are  just  a  few  of  the  unintended  consequences  that  the  inappropriate
application  of  export  controls  have  on  our  national  security  and  our  economic  com-
petitiveness:

• At  a  time  when  battlefield  inter-operability  is  increasingly  the  norm,  the  li-
censing  process  can  prevent  repair  at  facilities  closest  to  the  theater  of  oper-
ation.

capable research centers outside the United States.

expanding into new fields and from applying new scientific developments.

• Export controls constrain both U.S. commercial and military capabilities from
• The  government’s  rules  are  accelerating  the  development  of  technologies  in
• As  foreign  companies  and  governments  fill  these  competitive  gaps,  valuable
technical developments occur outside the U.S. to which the U.S. military and
intelligence agencies then have no access.
• U.S.  scientists  are  hobbled  by  rules  that  prevent  them  from  working  with
world-class foreign scientists and laboratories located overseas, making it less
likely that valuable discoveries and inventions will occur in the U.S.
• The government’s rules are driving jobs abroad-knowledge-intensive jobs that

are critical to the U.S. economy.

There  is  clearly  a  better  way  to  manage  the  application  of  American  science  and
technology abroad that protects our national security and our competitiveness. This
report  articulates  the  need  for  the  U.S.  S&T  sector  to  ‘‘run  faster’’  by  anticipating
and capitalizing on research breakthroughs more quickly than those who would use
these  advances  to  harm  us  or  compete  against  us  economically,  and  by  developing
qualitatively  better  products  and  services  with  the  best  talent  available.  In  policy
terms,  running  faster  means  having  an  agile  system  of  national  security  controls
that can adapt quickly to the changing geopolitical and technological landscapes.

The  first  recommendation  proposes  the  establishment  of  two  administrative  enti-
ties, possibly within the National Security Council. The first is a coordinating center
for export controls that will constitute a ‘‘one-stop-shop’’ for all export-license appli-
cations. The chief role of this small coordinating center is to determine whether the
Department of Commerce or the Department of State should handle the license ap-
plication and then dispatch the application to the appropriate place for decision.

The second entity is an appeals panel, possibly composed of retired federal judges,
that  will  hear  and  decide  disputes  about  whether  export  licenses  are  required,  and
whether  particular  decisions  to  grant  or  deny  licenses  were  made  properly.  This
panel  will  also  hear  appeals  on  whether  ‘‘sunset’’  requirements  have  been  carried
out  properly.  The  committee  proposes  that  ‘‘sunset’’  requirements  be  applied  to  all
items  on  U.S.  export  control  lists,  and  it  would  require  findings  to  be  made  every
12  months  that  removing  controls  on  an  item  would  present  a  substantial  risk  to
national security.

The  second  recommendation  proposes  that  the  administration  of  existing  export
control statutes—the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act—
should  assure  the  scientific  and  technological  competitiveness  of  the  United  States
as  a  prerequisite  for  both  national  security  and  economic  prosperity.  To  assure  the
conditions  for  scientific  and  technological  competitiveness,  the  committee  has  rec-
ommended that the Fundamental Research Exemption (also known as National Se-
curity  Decision  Directive  189),  which  has  been  in  effect  since  1985  and  reaffirmed
by  then  National  Security  Advisor,  Condoleezza  Rice  in  November  2001,  be  main-
tained and properly implemented.

In addition, the committee proposes the establishment of an economic competitive-
ness exemption that eliminates export controls on dual-use technologies where they,
or  their  functional  equivalents,  are  available  without  restriction  in  open  markets
outside  the  United  States.  Just  as  NSDD–189  precludes  the  conduct  and  reporting
of  unclassified  information  from  being  restricted,  the  economic  competitiveness  ex-
emption  would  preclude  the  export  of  so  called  ‘‘dual-use’’  items  that  are,  or  soon
will be, legally available in open markets overseas, from being restricted.

The third recommendation addresses the need to maintain and enhance access to
the  reservoir  of  human  talent  from  foreign  sources  to  strengthen  the  U.S.  science
and  technology  base.  Put  simply,  this  will  help  ensure  that  the  United  States  re-
mains the destination of choice for the world’s ‘‘best and brightest.’’

These  innovations  can  help  to  bring  transparency,  efficiency  and  consistency  to  a
system  that  is  now  lacking  all  three  of  these  qualities.  They  will  help  to  protect
what  needs  to  be  protected  without  harming  the  economy  or  our  scientific  leader-
ship.  The  committee  recommends  that  the  President  sign  an  Executive  Order  in
early 2009 that will put these provisions into effect ninety days hence.

This  Executive  Order  will  be  fully  consistent  with  existing  legislation.  It  would
not  and  cannot  contravene  current  law,  but  rather  would  govern  the  exercise  of
Presidential authorities established under existing law. The Executive Order would
not affect anything that is protected by national security classification, which is ad-
dressed  by  a  separate  Executive  Order,  nor  would  it  address  export  controls  that
the  State  Department  imposes  strictly  on  foreign  policy  grounds.  The  Executive
Order signifies that the President will bring discipline into a process over which he

34

already  has  primary  authority.  As  a  first  step  in  overhauling  the  national  security
controls over science and technology, putting these provisions into effect will create
a  record  and  experience  base  that  Congress  can  evaluate—and  modify  as  it  sees
fit—at such time as export control legislation can be successfully addressed.

Perhaps  the  most  significant  challenge  to  implementing  these  recommendations
is  to  help  the  relevant  agencies  understand  that  these  reforms  will  not  micro-man-
age  their  own  licensing  procedures  or  challenge  agency  expertise.  They  will,  how-
ever,  bring  consistency  and  efficiency  to  the  application  process,  and  transparency
to the agencies’ decisions.

If these reforms are not implemented, the system will continue to bog down, with
multiplying negative effects to our national security and competitiveness. There will
be  nothing  to  prevent  the  continued  erosion  of  our  defense  industrial  base;  the  loss
of  market-share  globally  in  advanced  technologies;  the  off-shoring  of  knowledge  in-
tensive jobs; the bureaucratic wrangling among the agencies to name a few.

In closing, I am grateful for the interest that the Committee on Science and Tech-
nology  has  taken  in  this  report  and  hope  that  your  Members  will  remain  involved
in  these  efforts,  particularly  in  helping  to  assure  the  scientific  and  technological
competitiveness of the United States.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  A.  THOMAS  YOUNG,  LOCKHEED  MARTIN
CORPORATION  (RET.);  CO-CHAIR,  CENTER  FOR  STRATEGIC
AND  INTERNATIONAL  STUDIES  (CSIS),  WORKING  GROUP  ON
THE  HEALTH  OF  THE  U.S.  SPACE  INDUSTRIAL  BASE  AND
THE IMPACT OF EXPORT CONTROLS
Mr.  YOUNG.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair,  Mr.  Hall,  Committee  Mem-
bers,  I  greatly  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  provide  the  views  of
the  committee  I  co-chair  on  the  impact  of  export  controls  on  our
space endeavors.

One of the things we highlighted is that we strongly support the
United  States’  need  for  export  controls  that  really  do  two  things,
one,  protect  technologies  that  are  critical  to  our  national  security
and  two,  maximize  the  opportunity  to  maintain  our  leadership  in
critical  areas.  It  is  our  overarching  view  that  our  current  export
controls  have  an  adverse  impact  on  our  national  security,  a  nega-
tive  impact  on  our  industrial  base,  particularly  at  the  second  and
third  tier  of  the  base  and  they  complicate  the  relationships  nec-
essary  to  mutually-beneficial,  international  cooperative  endeavors.

These  deficiencies  are  both  serious  and  correctable.  We  found
that we are controlling technologies that are not critical to our na-
tional security and are readily available in the global marketplace.
The most obvious are commercial communications satellite systems
which  are  a  globally  available  commodity  today.  The  result  of  this
over-control  is  that  our  space  industry  loses  international  sales,
second  and  third  level  suppliers  which  depend  upon  the  inter-
national  market  have  questionable  viability,  other  countries  have
determined  that  it  is  in  their  best  interest  to  develop  indigenous
capabilities  rather  than  be  dependent  upon  the  United  States  as  a
supplier. For cooperative endeavors, the United States ceases to be
the  partner  of  choice.  Our  access  to  international  innovation  is
greatly  diminished.  This  is  extraordinarily  important  because  the
United  States  has  always  been  a  technology  vacuum  cleaner.  We
are  incredibly  good  at  taking  technology  no  matter  where  it  comes
from  and  turning  it  to  our  military  and  our  economic  benefit.  And
we  are  cutting  ourselves  off  from  having  access  to  some  of  the
world’s best human capital.

In summary, this over control by our current export control poli-
cies  and  procedures  have  accelerated  the  development  of  an  inter-
national  space  community  resulting  in  the  United  States’  pre-
eminence being challenged in many areas. It has resulted in us be-
coming  somewhat  insular  which  always  results  in  a  technological
decline. Our national security and our space community have been
adversely impacted. Without change, our export control policies and
regulations for space will continue to erode as both a national secu-
rity and an economic advantage.

The  recommendations  in  the  report  that  General  Scowcroft
talked  about,  Fortress  America,  are  consistent  with  the  rec-
ommendations  in  our  report  and  they  would  help  to  mitigate  the
adverse impact of export controls on the space sector.

Our  current  export  controls  need  major  correction  by  both  the
Administration  and  the  Congress  to  reconcile  the  strategic  intent.
Items  that  are  globally  available  such  as  commercial  communica-
tion  satellite  systems  should  be  removed  from  the  controls.  The
process  of  implementation  of  the  controls  should  be  user-friendly
for  both  the  public  and  the  private  sectors.  The  process  and  proce-
dures  must  be  structured  in  a  manner  that  allows  access  to  inter-
national technology and human capital with minimum restrictions.
We must change the policies and procedures that affect the way we
treat our partners in international cooperative programs. Such pro-
grams  allow  us  to  be  a  full  participant  in  the  international  space
community resulting in knowing what is going on, having access to
technology,  and  builds  relationships  with  some  of  the  world’s  best
minds.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF A. THOMAS YOUNG

Chairman Gordon and Mr. Hall,

It is a privilege to appear before this distinguished committee to present the find-
ings  and  recommendations  of  an  independent  Working  Group  from  the  Center  on
Strategic  and  International  Studies  (CSIS)  on  the  Health  of  the  U.S.  Space  Indus-
trial Base and the Impact of Export Controls.

It  was  my  honor  to  co-chair  this  expert  study  group  with  Dr.  William  Ballhaus,
The Aerospace Corporation, and Mr. Pierre Chao, Senior Associate, CSIS. The other
distinguished members of our Working Group were:

Richard Albrecht, Moog
Jeffrey Bialos, Johns Hopkins
Lincoln Bloomfield Jr., Palmer Coates
David Danzillio, Emcore Photovoltaics
John Douglas, Aerospace Industries Association
Paul Kaminski, Technovation
John Klineberg, Consultant
Lon Levin, SkySeven Ventures
Tom Marsh, Lockheed Martin, retired
Tom Moorman, Booz, Allen Hamilton
J.R. Thompson, Orbital Sciences
John Tilelli, Cypress International
Robert Walker, Wexler & Walker Public Policy Associates

Our task was as follows:

• 1) Review previous and ongoing studies on export-controls and the U.S. space-
industrial base and 2) assess the health of the U.S. space-industrial base and
determine if there is any adverse impact from export controls, particularly on
the lower-tier contractors.

• Review  the  results  of  the  economic  survey  of  the  U.S.  space  industrial  base
conducted by the Department of Commerce and analyzed by the Air Force Re-
search Laboratory (AFRL).

• Integrate the findings of the study group with the result of the AFRL/Depart-
ment of Commerce survey to determine overall conclusions and recommenda-
tions  regarding  the  impact  of  export  controls  on  the  U.S.  space-industrial
base.

The methodology we used to meet this task was:

• Leverage a broad set of interviews and data from:

Æ the U.S. Government

• Department  of  State,  Department  of  Defense  (OSD/Policy,  OSD/
AT&L,  DTSA,  STRATCOM,  General  Council{??}),  NRO,  Department
of Commerce, NASA, FAA, and GAO

• the U.S. Congress

Æ Foreign Governments and agencies (Asia and Europe)
Æ U.S. industry

• Boeing,  Lockheed  Martin,  Northrop  Grumman,  ATK,  Moog,  Swales,

GeoEye and SES Americom

Æ Other experts

• IDA, Aerospace Corporation, Booz Allen Hamilton, Satellite Industry
Association,  Space  Foundation,  U.S.  Chamber  of  Commerce,  CSIS,
and Aviation Week

• Leverage  the  comprehensive  survey  of  space-industrial  base  undertaken  by

AFRL/Department of Commerce

In doing this study, we were guided by the following set of principles:

• Space is critically important to U.S. national security
• Global leadership in space is a national imperative
• Similarly,  sustaining  technological  superiority  in  space  is  a  U.S.  national  in-

• Given  the  interdependence  between  the  defense,  intelligence,  civil  and  com-

mercial sectors of space, U.S. leadership in all four is important

• A strong space-industrial base is important
• A  prudent  export  control  policy  is  necessary  to  control  sensitive  technologies,

terest

and

• The U.S. must have unimpeded access to the technologies (global and domes-

tic) needed for national space systems

Mr. Chairman and distinguished Members of the Committee, the Working Group
recognizes  that  the  United  States  must  have  export  controls  that  protect  tech-
nologies  critical  to  our  national  security  and  maximize  the  opportunity  to  maintain
our  leadership  in  critical  areas.  However,  it  was  the  overarching  conclusion  of  our
study  that  our  current  export  controls  have  had  an  adverse  impact  on  our  national
security,  a  negative  impact  on  our  industrial  base,  most  particularly  at  the  second
and third tiers of the industry, and has complicated the relationships necessary for
mutually-beneficial, international cooperative endeavors.

It  is  our  view  though  that  all  of  the  deficiencies  in  our  export  control  processes
can  be  corrected  without  an  adverse  impact  on  our  national  security.  It  is  also  our
view  that  correcting  these  deficiencies  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  our  national
security.

We  found  not  only  that  the  intent  of  current  export  controls  was  not  being  real-
ized, but it was also having an adverse impact on the health of the space-industrial
base.  Specifically,  we  are  controlling  technologies  that  are  not  critical  to  our  na-
tional security and are readily available in the global marketplace. Most obvious are
commercial communications satellite systems that are a widely available commodity
today.  There  are  clearly  others,  such  as  some  aspects  of  weather  satellites.  The  re-
sult  of  this  over-control  is  that  our  space  industry  loses  international  sales;  other
countries conclude it is more advantageous to develop indigenous capabilities rather
than  be  subject  to  our  export  control  requirements;  and  countries  that  throughout
the  space  age  have  been  our  partners  in  space  exploration  no  longer  consider  the
U.S. the partner of choice.

Instead  of  maintaining  our  leadership,  this  over-control  has  been  a  catalyst  for
other  nations  to  develop  their  own  capabilities.  An  example  is  India.  Clearly,  U.S.
export  controls  have  been  a  motivation  for  their  current  most  impressive  develop-
ment of a comprehensive national space program. In the last decade, the space com-
munity has grown from a very exclusive Club X into a very broad array of countries
with  substantial  space  capabilities.  As  an  example,  a  dozen  nations  are  able  to
launch their own satellites, and 38 countries have operational control over their own
communications satellites. Although this expansion of space capabilities would have
eventually  occurred,  U.S.  export  controls  have  caused  it  to  accelerate  to  the  degree
that today, the U.S. does not control its proliferation, and U.S. preeminence in space
is  under  challenge  in  many  areas.  Other  unintended  consequences  of  our  over-con-
trol  are  that  we  have  become  insular,  meaning  we  are  not  a  full  player  in  inter-
national  space,  and  consequently  we  have  somewhat  diminished  our  access  to  for-
eign innovation and human capital.

Our  report  presents  13  findings  and  nine  recommendations,  which  are  summa-

rized below.
Finding  1:  Overall  financial  health  of  the  top-tier  manufacturers  in  the  space  in-
dustrial  base  is  ‘‘good,’’  but  there  are  areas  of  concern  within  the  broader  health  of
the industry.
Finding  2:  As  earlier  studies  have  documented,  the  ability  of  the  government  and
industry to meet program-execution commitments remains inadequate.
Finding 3: The U.S. space-industrial base is largely dependent on the U.S. defense/
national security budget.
Finding 4: There are rapidly emerging foreign space capabilities, and the U.S. does
not control their proliferation.
Finding 5: U.S. preeminence in space is under challenge in many areas.
Finding  6:  The  current  export-control  policy  has  not  prevented  the  rise  of  foreign
space  capabilities  and  in  some  cases  has  encouraged  it  (International  Traffic  in
Arms Regulations (ITAR)-free space products).
Finding 7: U.S. leadership in space benefits significantly from access to foreign in-
novation and human capital. That access is becoming increasingly difficult.
Finding  8:  The  current  export  control  policy  is  constricting  U.S.  engagement  and
partnership  with  the  rest  of  the  global  space  community  and  is  feeding  a  growing
separation  between  the  U.S.  space  community  and  an  emerging,  non-U.S.  space
community.
Finding  9:  Some  elements  of  the  export-control  laws  are  in  conflict  with  the  U.S.
National Space Policy, which has as one of its goals to ‘‘encourage international co-
operation  with  foreign  nations  on  space  activities  that  are  of  mutual  benefit’’  and
states  that  ‘‘space-related  exports  that  are  currently  available  or  are  planned  to  be
available in the global marketplace shall be considered favorably.’’

38

Finding  10:  The  U.S.  share  of  the  global  space  markets  is  steadily  declining,  and
U.S.  companies  are  finding  it  increasingly  difficult  to  participate  in  foreign  space
markets.
Finding 11: Export controls are adversely affecting U.S. companies’ ability to com-
pete for foreign space business, particularly the second and third tiers. And it is the
second and third tiers of industry that is the source of much innovation, and is nor-
mally  the  most  engaged  in  the  global  marketplace  in  the  aerospace/defense  sector.
Finding 12: A U.S. export-control policy that protects sensitive security space capa-
bilities is important.
Finding  13:  There  is  unanimous  agreement  that  the  export-control  process  can  be
improved without adversely affecting national security.

Working Group Recommendations

1. The  Administration  and  Congress  should  review  and  reconcile  the  strategic

intent of space export controls.

2. Critical  space  technologies  should  be  identified  and  should  remain  on  the

Munitions List and under the State Department ITAR process.

3. Remove  from  the  Munitions  List  commercial  communications  satellite  sys-
tems,  dedicated  subsystems,  and  components  specifically  designed  for  com-
mercial  use;  provide  safeguards  by  having  the  Department  of  Defense  iden-
tify critical space components and technologies that should always require li-
censing  and  referral.  Have  the  appropriate  Executive  branch  departments
conduct  a  study  to  see  if  other  space  technologies  should  be  removed  from
the Munitions List (e.g., weather satellites).

4. Annually  review  the  appropriateness  of  designating  specific  satellite  and
other  space  systems,  components,  and  capabilities  as  Munitions  List  items
based on criticality of items and on their availability outside the U.S.

5. Additionally, Congress could amend the legislation related to satellite export
licensing  and  adopt  some  of  the  best  practices  being  used  in  other  proc-
esses—set timelines, technology thresholds, de minimus rules, and special li-
censing vehicles.

6. The  Secretary  of  Defense  and  NASA  Administrator,  in  addition  to  the  Sec-
retary  of  State,  should  have  the  authority  to  grant  real-time,  case-by-case,
specific  time  period  exemptions  for  anomaly  resolutions  deemed  to  be  in  the
national interest based on criteria from the National Space Policy.

7. Create a special program authority to permit timely engagement of U.S. par-

ticipants in multinational space projects.

8. Increase the dollar threshold for satellite exports, increase Congressional no-
tification  and  establish  a  mechanism  to  enable  the  threshold  to  adjust  with
inflation.

9. Relevant  space-related  government  agencies  should  collaboratively  under-

take an annual assessment of their industrial base.

Mr. Chairman, I have attached a copy of the Working Group’s full report [see Ap-
pendix  2:  Additional  Material  for  the  Record]  and  I  look  forward  to  your  questions.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  CLAUDE  R.  CANIZARES,  VICE  PRESIDENT
FOR  RESEARCH  AND  ASSOCIATE  PROVOST,  BRUNO  ROSSI
PROFESSOR  OF  PHYSICS,  MASSACHUSETTS  INSTITUTE  OF
TECHNOLOGY
Dr.  CANIZARES.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair,  Mr.  Hall,  and  distin-
guished  Members.  I  greatly  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  appear
before you today.

Allow  me  to  begin  by  quoting  one  sentence:  ‘‘The  strength  of
American science requires a research environment conducive to cre-
ativity,  an  environment  in  which  the  free  exchange  of  ideas  is  a
vital component.’’

This  sentence  comes  from  President  Ronald  Reagan’s  National
Security  Decision  Directive  NSDD–189  which  establishes  as  na-
tional  policy,  and  I  quote,  ‘‘that,  to  the  maximum  extent  possible,
the  products  of  fundamental  research  remain  unrestricted.’’  Pro-
mulgated in 1985 and still in force today, the directive provides the
basis for the so-called Fundamental Research Exclusion that is em-
bodied in current export control regulations.

Our  report  described  by  General  Scowcroft,  Beyond  Fortress
America,  finds  that  freedom  of  scientific  inquiry  and  the  free  ex-
change of technical information are even much more important now
than they were in 1985. He alluded to this, and I will cite four rea-
sons.

First,  whatever  dominance  we  might  have  enjoyed  in  our  sci-
entific  leadership  in  1985,  we  are  now  clearly  one  among  many
international players in nearly every technical field.

Second, even within our borders, a significant fraction of our sci-
entific  and  engineering  workforce  is  international.  By  the  year
2000,  nearly  a  quarter  of  the  science  and  engineering  workers  in
the U.S. were foreign nationals. I imagine it was considerably high-
er  today.  Two-thirds  of  the  post-doctoral  researchers  in  the  United
States are international.

Third, thanks to the Internet, both the pace of scientific commu-
nications is now instantaneous and geography is global. The Inter-
net does not have national boundaries.

And  fourth,  in  the  present  national  security  and  economic  cli-
mate, a vigorous and innovative research community is more much
important than ever. Universities are the prime performers of basic
research in the U.S., and they are also the source of our future sci-
entific and technical workforce, both of which are essential for both
national security and for economic prosperity of our country.

As  one  measure  of  economic  impact  from  my  own  institution,
MIT,  a  Kauffman  Foundation  report  released  just  last  week  esti-
mates  that  approximately  26,000  currently  active  companies  were
founded by MIT alumni employing over three million workers with
annual world revenues over $2 trillion.

For  universities,  the  primary  area  of  concern  regarding  export
controls  involves  restrictions  on  the  sharing  of  technical  informa-
tion  about  controlled  items  with  non-U.S.  persons  within  the
United  States  often  referred  to  as  deemed  exports.  The  scope  of
regulated  technologies  is  broad  and  includes  many  that  are  avail-
able outside the U.S. as my colleagues have already mentioned.

Despite a Presidential directive protecting fundamental research,
export  controls  continue  to  inhibit,  retard  or  eliminate  university

research  projects,  and  there  are  hundreds  of  stories  of  sand  in  the
gears because of export controls.

While several positive actions have been taken in recent years by
the  Department  of  Commerce  and  the  Department  of  Defense,  our
report suggests that a more systematic and fundamental change is
required,  to  move  from  a  philosophy  of  containment  and  retrench-
ment  to  one  of  prudent  engagement.  Specifically,  the  report  rec-
ommends  as  General  Scowcroft  has  mentioned,  this  Fundamental
Research Exemption be maintained but also that it be properly im-
plemented which has not always been the case.

We  also  recommend  an  Economic  Competitiveness  Exemption
and the adjustment of visa policies to access the reservoir of human
talent in science and technology.

Because  you  asked,  Mr.  Chair,  for  specific  recommendation  for
this  committee,  allow  me  personally  to  respectfully  suggest  that
this committee, through its oversight of key science agencies, could
play  a  very  important  role  by  endorsing  the  change  in  philosophy
that  was  recommended  in  our  report  as  well  as  the  detailed  rec-
ommendations  and  by  maintaining  that  each  federal  agency  under
your  oversight  must  implement  a  plan  and  periodically  report  how
it is addressing these issues.

Thank you for your attention.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Canizares follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CLAUDE R. CANIZARES

Mr. Chairman and distinguished Members, thank you for taking up this very im-
portant  topic  and  for  your  invitation.  I  am  honored  to  be  sitting  with  two  very  dis-
tinguished co-panelists, Gen. Scowcroft and Mr. Young.

I am Vice President for Research at MIT and a space scientist. For over 35 years
I  have  designed,  built  and  used  space  instrumentation  for  scientific  research.  Al-
though  I  represent  the  university  community  on  this  panel,  I  also  have  experience
with matters of national security. I have served on the Scientific Advisory Board of
the U.S. Air Force, and I currently oversee MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory, a facility that
does  classified  national  security  research.  I  am  also  a  Director  of  L–3  Communica-
tions,  a  Fortune  200  corporation.  And  I  was  privileged  to  contribute  to  the  recently
released  National  Academies’  report  ‘‘Beyond  Fortress  America,’’  summarized  by
Gen. Scowcroft. My testimony is based in part on that report.

Allow me to begin by quoting one sentence: ‘‘The strength of American science re-
quires a research environment conducive to creativity, an environment in which the
free  exchange  of  ideas  is  a  vital  component.’’  [National  Security  Decision  Directive
189, 1985]

This  sentence  comes  from  President  Ronald  Reagan’s  National  Security  Decision
Directive  189.  NSDD  189  establishes  as  national  policy  ‘‘that,  to  the  maximum  ex-
tent possible, the products of fundamental research remain unrestricted.’’

Reagan’s  NSDD  189  was  promulgated  in  1985,  reaffirmed  in  2001,  and  is  still  in
force today. It provides the basis for the so-called Fundamental Research Exclusion
embodied in current export control regulations in order to protect the enormous ben-
efits derived from the ‘‘free exchange of ideas.’’

Our  report  finds  that  freedom  of  scientific  inquiry  and  the  free  exchange  of  tech-
nical information are even much more important now than they were over 20 years
ago when President Reagan signed his directive.

Let me cite four points:
First,  whatever  dominance  we  might  have  enjoyed  in  our  scientific  leadership  in
1985,  we  are  now  one  among  many  international  players  in  nearly  every  technical
field. In my own discipline of physics, both the world’s biggest fusion energy facility,
ITER,  and  the  most  powerful  particle  accelerator,  the  Large  Hadron  Collider,  are
located abroad. In our own, U.S. Physics journals in 2006, 70 percent of the publica-
tions  now  come  from  international  authors—ten  years  ago  it  was  50  percent.  In
2006  international  inventors  accounted  for  one  half  of  the  patents  filed  with  the
U.S. Patent Office [Beyond Fortress America, p. 30]. No doubt both figures are high-
er now.

41

Second,  even  within  our  borders,  a  significant  fraction  of  our  scientific  and  engi-
neering workforce comes from overseas. ‘‘The percentage of science and engineering
workers  in  the  U.S.  who  are  foreign  nationals  increased  from  14  percent  to  22  per-
cent  from  1990–2000.  In  2006  more  than  half  the  doctorate-level  graduating  engi-
neers in the United States were foreign-born, as were 45 percent of the Ph.D. recipi-
ents in the physical sciences, computer sciences, and life sciences’’ [Beyond Fortress
America, p. 34].

Universities, like MIT, are international melting pots. Roughly one-third of MIT’s
current  faculty  were  born  outside  the  U.S.  Forty  percent  of  MIT’s  6,000  graduate
students  are  international,  and  each  year  approximately  1,600  international  schol-
ars bring their skills to MIT.

Third,  thanks  to  the  Internet,  both  the  pace  and  geography  of  scientific  commu-
nications  have  exploded  since  1985—the  pace  is  now  instantaneous  and  the  geog-
raphy  is  global.  This  rapid  and  pervasive  interchange  of  ideas  and  innovation  fuels
remarkable  advances.  For  example,  the  information  technology  revolution  of  the
1990’s was a significant factor in fueling a remarkable three percent annual growth
in U.S. productivity.

My  fourth  point  is  to  suggest  that,  in  the  present  national  security  and  economic
climate, a vigorous and innovative research community is more important than ever.
Universities  are  the  primary  performers  of  basic  research  in  the  U.S.,  and  they
are also the source of our future scientific and technical workforce. This human and
intellectual  capital  is  essential  contributors  to  the  national  security  and  economic
prosperity of the United States.

As  a  measure  of  economic  impact,  MIT  research  results  in  roughly  125  licenses
for  new  technology  and  spawns  20–25  new  start-up  companies  each  year.  A  great
many  more  companies,  nearly  1,000,  are  founded  each  year  by  MIT  alumni.  A
Kauffman  Foundation  report  on  MIT  Entrepreneurship  released  last  week  gives  a
conservative estimate that if a nation were formed from the active companies found-
ed  by  MIT  alumni,  it  would  have  the  17th  largest  economy  in  the  world.  The  real
number  is  plausibly  higher:  26,000  MIT  alumni-founded  companies  employing  over
three  million  workers  with  annual  world  revenues  over  $2  trillion,  comparable  to
the  11th  largest  Nation’s  economy.  Interestingly,  half  the  companies  formed  by  our
non-U.S.-citizen alumni are located in the U.S., employing over 100,000 people [Rob-
erts  &  Eesley,  Entrepreneurial  Impact:  The  Role  of  MIT,  Kauffman  Foundation,
2009]. Nationwide, roughly two-thirds of internationals receiving Ph.D.s in the U.S.
stay in our country [Nature Vol. 457, p. 522, 2009].

For  universities,  the  primary  area  of  concern  regarding  export  controls  involves
restrictions on the sharing of technical data and information about controlled items
with  non-U.S.  persons  within  the  U.S.  or  abroad.  These  are  often  referred  to  as
‘‘deemed  exports.’’  There  has  always  been  considerable  ambiguity  around  how  or
when NSDD 189’s protection of fundamental research applies and whether—despite
clear  language  to  that  effect  in  NSDD  189—it  covers  the  conduct  as  well  as  the
products of research. Moreover, because the exclusion applies to universities, it does
not facilitate interactions between universities and industry or national laboratories.
So,  despite  a  Presidential  directive  protecting  fundamental  research,  export  con-
trols  continue  to  inhibit,  retard  or  eliminate  research  projects  that  do  not  involve
militarily  relevant  technology.  Just  last  year  one  MIT  research  group  abandoned  a
fruitful  international  space  astronomy  mission  because  of  export-control  impedi-
ments.  The  foreign  partners  are  proceeding  with  out  us,  thereby  leaving  us  out  of
the  advances  in  science  and  technology  they  will  be  making  on  their  own.  Many
more  projects  have  been  delayed  by  many  months  as  control  issues  are  sorted  out.
One  colleague,  leader  of  a  major  NASA  mission,  had  to  wait  18  months  for  a  Tech-
nical Assistance Agreement so her French graduate student could access Mars data
from  a  NASA  computer  system.  There  are  hundreds  of  such  stories  of  ‘‘sand  in  the
gears’’  from  export  controls  [e.g.,  see  Space  Science  and  the  International  Traffic  in
Arms  Regulations:  A  Workshop,  National  Academies  Press,  2008;  The  Deemed  Ex-
port  Rule  in  the  Era  of  Globalization,  Department  of  Commerce,  2007;  Science  and
Security in a Post 9/11 World, National Academies Press 2007].

A  major  difficulty  is  the  broad  scope  of  the  export  control  regulations.  For  exam-
ple,  the  State  Department  controls  virtually  all  spacecraft  systems,  associated
equipment  and  data,  regardless  of  their  actual  military  utility.  And  both  State  and
Commerce  often  control  technologies  that  are  widely  available  outside  the  U.S.  For
many  categories  of  the  Commerce  Control  List,  one-third  to  one-half  of  the  items
are  controlled  only  by  the  U.S.  [Beyond  Fortress  America,  p.  34,  p.  86].  And  most
importantly,  none  of  the  other  countries  has  a  provision  comparable  to  our  deemed
export regulation [The Deemed Export Rule in the Era of Globalization, Department
of Commerce, 2007, p. 6].

42

Several positive actions have been taken in recent years. The Department of Com-
merce  formed  the  Deemed  Export  Advisory  Committee  (DEAC)  and  the  Emerging
Technology and Research Advisory Committee (ETRAC), on which I serve. And last
June,  Undersecretary  of  Defense  John  Young  reaffirmed  the  fundamental  research
exclusion in DOD sponsored activities. But when I recently asked a senior Pentagon
official  if  the  John  Young  letter  was  having  an  effect,  he  replied  that  it  was  ‘‘too
soon to tell.’’

Our report suggests that a more systematic and fundamental change is required,
to  move  from  a  philosophy  of  containment  and  retrenchment  to  one  of  prudent  en-
gagement.

As  Gen.  Scowcroft  describes,  Beyond  Fortress  America  recommends  maintenance
and proper implementation of the Fundamental Research Exemption. Proper imple-
mentation is critical, as numerous forces continue to eviscerate the spirit and letter
of  Reagan’s  NSDD  189.  We  also  recommend  the  creation  of  an  Economic  Competi-
tiveness  Exemption  to  eliminate  controls  on  dual-use  technologies  that  are  readily
available  outside  the  U.S.  And  we  recommend  steps  for  adjusting  visa  policies  that
will  enhance  our  access  to  the  reservoir  of  human  talent  in  science  and  technology
from foreign sources.

Your  invitation,  Mr.  Chairman,  asked  me  what  your  committee  might  do  to  ad-
dress  the  negative  effects  of  export  controls.  Allow  me  to  respectfully  suggest  that
this  committee,  through  its  oversight  of  key  science  agencies,  could  play  a  very  im-
portant  role  by  endorsing  the  change  in  philosophy  as  well  as  the  detailed  rec-
ommendations in our report, and by mandating that each federal agency under your
oversight  must  formulate,  implement  a  plan  to  carry  them  out  and  report  to  you
on its progress.

Thank you for your attention.

STATEMENT OF MAJOR GENERAL ROBERT S. DICKMAN, EXEC-
UTIVE  DIRECTOR,  AMERICAN  INSTITUTE  OF  AERONAUTICS
AND ASTRONAUTICS
Major  General  DICKMAN.  Mr.  Chair,  Mr.  Hall,  Members  of  the
Committee,  I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  be  with  you  today
to  represent  our  members  as  we  address  this  extremely  important
issue.

Each year many of AIAA’s 30,000 professional and 6,000 student
members  visit  the  Congress  to  express  our  views  on  issues  impor-
tant  to  the  aerospace  profession.  Last  year  for  the  first  time  the
subject of export controls had become such an important concern to
our  individual  members  that  it  was  on  our  key  issue  list,  along
with  such  topics  as  the  overall  level  of  R&D  funding  and  creating
an  integrated  aerospace  workforce  development  strategy.  It  is
again  on  the  list  that  we  will  address  when  we  are  back  for  our
2009 visit three weeks from today.

My  words  about  whom  I  represent  are  carefully  chosen.  General
Scowcroft, Mr. Young, and Dr. Canizares have drawn an enormous
amount  of  information  from  government,  industry  and  academic
sources.  There  is  little  I  can  add  to  what  they  say,  but  what  I  do
have to add reflects the views expressed by aerospace professionals.
AIAA is the largest technical society in the world serving the global
aerospace  workforce.  The  vast  majority  of  our  members  are  sci-
entists and engineers who are involved day to day in designing, de-
veloping,  and  building  the  miraculous  systems  that  fly  in  air  and
space,  serving  commercial  travelers,  scientific  research  and  na-
tional  security.  Export  controls  are  a  major  concern  to  this  work-
force.

Almost continually since the dawn of man’s space flight and cer-
tainly  shortly  after  the  beginning  of  the  space  age,  the  United
States has enjoyed global technological leadership in air and space
systems.  Even  today  in  many  areas  of  space  capabilities,  our  com-
petencies are unmatched. However, as you have heard, that leader-
ship is being challenged in many areas and has been lost in some.
There isn’t a single class of space systems, launch vehicles, imaging
and  signals  intelligence  collection,  position  navigation  and  timing,
mobile  and  fixed  communications,  environmental  sensing,  tactical
warning,  and  even  space  tourism  where  there  isn’t  a  qualified  for-
eign  competitor.  All  of  these  systems  have  national  security  impli-
cations, and all are available for purchase on the global market.

Not only are there competitors, one of the attributes often touted
by  foreign  suppliers  is  that  they  have  no  U.S.  components.  They
don’t  phrase  it  quite  that  way,  though.  What  they  say  is  they  are
ITAR  free.  Our  arms  control  regulations  as  applied  to  space  sys-

tems not only have failed to meet the goals of slowing proliferation
of technologies with national security application, they fostered the
international  development  of  comparable  technologies  and  severely
impacted  the  ability  of  U.S.  firms  to  sell  commercial  products  on
the world market.

Each  year  AIAA  administers  about  25  technical  conferences
across  the  whole  spectrum  of  aerospace.  In  2008  over  5,300  tech-
nical  papers  were  published  in  our  conference  proceedings.  Every
one of these conferences has a requirement, that all papers comply
with ITAR. How much collaboration, how much information wasn’t
exchanged  because  of  that  limitation?  On  the  one  hand  you  could
say that the authors were appropriately protecting information im-
portant to our national security, and in many cases, I am sure that
was correct. On the other hand, we also weren’t getting insight into
what is being done overseas. When our companies can’t sell to over-
seas  manufacturers,  we  will  lose  understanding  of  what  else  is  in
those  foreign  systems.  When  a  company  or  individual  is  reluctant
to  even  discuss  the  design  of  a  simple  commercial  component  in  a
spacecraft  and  enter  into  technical  dialogue  with  an  international
colleague  because  of  the  very  real  criminal  penalties  associated
with  ITAR,  we  lose  a  source  of  information  that  simply  isn’t  avail-
able any other way.

As  you  have  heard,  our  export  policies  also  ripple  directly  into
the  workforce,  into  our  ability  to  hire  foreign  nationals  to  work  on
U.S.  space  systems.  Let  there  be  no  doubt  that  these  individuals
are still receiving the best aerospace education in the world at uni-
versities  around  the  United  States,  including  that  of  my  distin-
guished colleague. However, unlike several decades ago when many
of  the  best  and  brightest  stayed  in  the  United  States  because  the
work was more interesting and compensation was better, now most
have  no  choice  but  to  return  home.  We  will  train  them,  but  we
can’t put them to work on our most challenging problems, not while
they are graduate students and not while they can enter the work-
force later, either. In a very real sense, we the American taxpayer,
are  subsidizing  the  development  of  a  technical  workforce  that  is
building the systems that are taking business away from U.S. com-
panies and threatening our security.

I am not an advocate for protectionist policies. However, we obvi-
ously should restrict access to technologies, software and hardware,
that are critical to national security. On the other hand, I think we
are doing far more harm than good with a blanket approach to ex-
port control to space systems that is in place today.

We  at  AIAA  know  this  is  a  busy  time  for  the  Congress,  and  we
appreciate you holding this hearing. We look forward to your ques-
tions and offer our help in any way we can serve.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MAJOR GENERAL ROBERT S. DICKMAN

Chairman  Gordon,  Representative  Hall,  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  want  to
thank you for this opportunity to address this extremely important issue today. This
is a timely and necessary discussion, and I applaud your willingness to address the
topic.

U.S.  trade  and  visa  policies  put  in  place  to  provide  additional  layers  of  national
security  are  having  severe  and  long-term  effects  on  advanced  systems  technology
sectors  and  the  professional  workforce  that  serve  them.  As  a  result  industries  are

faltering, innovation is stifled, competencies are withering, and the technology work-
force is becoming less competitive in the global marketplace.

As  Executive  Director  of  the  American  Institute  of  Aeronautics  and  Astronautics,
I  represent  a  constituency  of  nearly  30,000  aerospace  professionals,  located  in  all
fifty states and in 80 countries internationally. These are the men and women who
are ‘‘in the trenches’’ and see first hand everyday the effects of export controls poli-
cies  and  International  Trafficking  in  Arms  Restrictions  (ITAR).  This  is  an  area  of
great concern for our members.

I  also  sit  before  you  as  a  retired  military  officer  with  37  years  of  service  to  our
nation  and  am  deeply  committed  to  its  security.  I  have  seen  the  effects  that  these
policies  have  had  from  the  acquisitions  side  as  well.  I  understand  the  need  to  pro-
tect our current advantages in capabilities.

We  all  understand  the  reasons  why  our  export  control  policies  were  put  in  place.
We have enjoyed technical superiority from decades of investment in education and
RDT&E, and from producing and attracting generations of the best intellectual tal-
ent  pool  the  world  has  ever  seen.  To  maintain  that  superiority,  these  policies  were
established  to  insulate  our  advantages  from  the  rest  of  the  world,  and  specifically
from  regimes  that  maintain  a  different  and  adversarial  world  view  from  our  own.
However,  we  need  to  make  a  realistic  evaluation  of  how  these  policies  are  being
implemented, and what effects they are having. We need to be willing to act if these
policies  are  falling  short,  if  these  policies  have  become  detrimental  to  our  goals.
Today,  the  reality  is  that  these  policies  are  counterproductive  to  their  stated  objec-
tives.

We  need  to  begin  corrective  steps  so  that  we  do  not  continue  to  exacerbate  the
crisis the current policies have created that are actually harming our national secu-
rity as key vendors in our technology sectors go out of business due to lack of export
opportunities thus denying us the very technology we are trying to protect. We need
to  make  certain  that  we  develop  and  implement  integrated  policies  and  holistic
strategies  that  enable  us  to  remain  technologically  superior  to  threats  against  our
national security, embrace participation in the international science community, and
regain competitiveness in the global marketplace.

There  are  things  we  can  begin  to  do  in  the  current  regimen  that  will  reestablish
some  faith  in  the  system  and  that  will  enable  us  to  adapt  rather  than  start  from
scratch  with  an  entirely  new  set  of  policies.  At  the  very  least  this  will  enable  us
to  correct  some  of  the  more  detrimental  aspects  of  the  current  policy  while  devel-
oping the next generation of export policies.

As  a  point  of  departure,  we  need  to  reevaluate  the  technologies  and  their  compo-
nents  listed  that  we  believe  provide  us  with  a  distinct  advantage  in  the  national
security  arena.  This  needs  to  be  done  on  a  regular  basis  so  that  the  list  can  keep
up  with  changes  and  advances  in  technologies  and  capabilities.  One  problem  with
the  current  lists  is  that  they  have  not  been  examined  comprehensively  since  their
inception. What we now have are broad lists of components with little rationale for
why  many  of  these  items  were  originally  restricted  and  whether  that  rationale  is
still  correct.  There  is  also  a  lack  of  explanation  for  how  a  component  is  evaluated
for export release and how decisions are made in the certification process. It is frus-
trating  to  both  venders  and  purchasers  to  have  so  many  unknowns  up-front  in  the
process.

Recommendation  1  in  the  National  Academies’  ‘‘Fortress  America’’  report  focuses
on  balancing  interests  and  objectives.  Several  of  the  action  items  included  in  the
recommendation revolve around this idea of evaluating the components on the lists,
individually  justifying  inclusion  both  on  a  basis  of  what  makes  the  item  unique  in
capability and in what way its export would present a substantial national security
risk.  In  other  words,  technologies  and  components  would  be  restricted  from  export
on  a  ‘‘by  exemption’’  basis,  rather  than  the  current  approval  for  export  on  an  indi-
vidual basis. This recommendation also stresses the need to regularly examine these
lists,  and  goes  so  far  as  to  recommend  ‘‘sunsetting’’  the  list  and  starting  over  as
often as every 12 months.

At  AIAA,  we  are  performing  an  independent  evaluation  of  satellite  components
similar to the suggestions in the ‘‘Fortress America’’ report. We have drawn on sub-
ject matter experts for this evaluation, and have created a process to analyze compo-
nents  based  on  several  criteria.  Our  objective  is  to  produce  a  survey,  and  a  well-
developed  process  that  will  be  helpful  in  developing  a  regular  evaluation  of  listed
components.

The  first  step  is  to  re-evaluate  whether  these  components  are  truly  commercial
use,  dual  use,  or  exclusively  military  use.  This  will  mean  developing  a  definition  of
what each of these categories involves, and then providing a compelling national in-
terest for listing components within these categories. I think we would all agree that
those  components  that  fall  into  that  last  category  should  remain  restricted,  and  a

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:00 May 16, 2009 Jkt 047610 PO 00000 Frm 00049 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\FULL09\022509\47610 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

46

number  of  the  components  that  fall  into  that  second  category  should  also  remain
restricted. A major part of the problem today is that many dual-use items with little
or  no  unique  military  value  are  controlled.  However,  because  the  state-of-the-art
changes,  and  the  evolution  of  the  commercial  marketplace,  we  must  continually  re-
evaluate  whether  each  component  remains  correctly  categorized.  This  is  really  a
process that should take place within the national security community as an honest
discussion, not a protectionist blanket.

Second, we need to examine whether the manufacturing capacity, either domestic
or  foreign,  offers  some  strategic  advantage.  By  this  I  mean  we  should  examine
whether the ability to produce a component or system provides some military advan-
tage,  and  then  determine  which  other  nations  have  that  capability.  This  is  to  pro-
vide  a  criterion  for  determining  whether  the  ability  to  produce  a  particular  compo-
nent  merits  greater  security  restrictions  than  would  just  the  capabilities  of  that
component.

These  first  two  steps  should  help  us  to  narrow  the  list  of  components  that  are
subject to the third step, which is to evaluate the performance of those components
on  this  shortened  list,  and  compare  them  to  the  capabilities  of  foreign  manufactur-
ers.  In  some  of  the  recent  reports  and  studies  on  this  issue  some  examples  have
been provided of foreign technology far out-pacing its U.S. counterpart and have re-
vealed  the  absurdity  of  applying  ITAR  restrictions  unilaterally  on  all  satellite  com-
ponents.  These  include  instances  where  the  performance  of  multiple  foreign  de-
signed  and  manufactured  components’  performance  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the
U.S. equivalent, and are readily available in the global marketplace. However, while
the U.S. product may enjoy some economically competitive advantages such as costs
associated  with  the  manufacturing  process,  the  U.S.  product  is  put  at  a  disadvan-
tage in this marketplace because it remains subject to ITAR and the export control
licensing process. The ‘‘Fortress America’’ report well describes this in the following
terms: ‘‘(t)he artificial limitations on trade imposed by lists of controlled technologies
have  had  predictable  results  with  respect  to  the  U.S.  position  in  global  markets.
With  U.S.  companies  prevented  by  export  controls  from  competing  in  certain  mar-
kets, foreign competitors . . . spring to fill these competitive gaps. As these competi-
tors  have  proliferated,  U.S.  companies  have  suffered  challenges  in  the  marketplace
that would not have been present but for export controls.’’

Fourth,  we  need  to  evaluate  the  trends  in  capabilities  of  foreign  components.
While  we  may  still  maintain  the  state-of-the-art  capabilities,  we  need  to  examine
how far equivalent components’ capabilities have come and project when we may ex-
pect those capabilities to surpass our own.

I  understand  that  there  are  practical  constraints  that  limit  this  process.  I  know
that  the  licensing  office  within  the  Department  of  State  has  been  streamlined,  and
that  they  have  become  much  more  efficient  in  processing  licensing  applications.
However, they are still limited in the human capital available to perform these eval-
uations, and I understand it would be placing an unrealistic burden upon that staff
to  complete  periodic  comprehensive  evaluations  of  the  components  that  they  may
not possess the expertise to perform, and while still maintaining their workload. To
make  the  problem  manageable,  the  list  must  be  shortened  carefully  but  quickly.  I
also  believe  that  the  Directorate  of  Defense  Trade  Controls  can  be  instrumental  in
working  with  policy-makers  to  develop  a  defined  standard  that  is  used  in  the  eval-
uation  of  applications,  and  I  do  think  that  it  would  be  very  helpful  for  both  the
venders  and  the  purchasers  to  understand  the  standard  when  assessing  the  utility
of moving forward with a licensing application.

CONCLUSION

There  are  some  encouraging  signs.  Just  five  years  ago  nobody  was  having  this
conversation  in  the  public  forum  even  though  the  problem  clearly  existed.  Our  pol-
icy-makers did not seem ready to accept the realities of the effects of current export
control  policies,  and  they  certainly  did  not  want  to  open  up  the  possibility  of  loos-
ening  restrictions  on  sensitive  technologies  during  these  uncertain  and  unsettling
times.  Industry  leaders  were  concerned  with  drawing  further  scrutiny  on  their  ap-
plications,  were  reluctant  to  be  seen  as  badgering  their  largest  customer,  the  U.S.
Government,  and  were  frankly  timid  on  this  issue  because  they  did  not  want  to  be
accused  of  putting  their  bottom  line  before  national  security.  Now,  however,  there
is  widespread  agreement  that  the  time  has  come  to  fully  address  these  issues,  and
I  believe  this  is  in  large  part  attributable  to  these  studies  that  have  been  men-
tioned,  as  well  as  other  reports  that  have  also  discussed  the  direct  decline  in  na-
tional  security  caused  by  these  and  other  restrictive  national  policies  on  export  of
technologies.

The effects we are seeing are troubling. It is a multi-faceted issue, and the current
state in each of these areas is alarming. Early on, we noticed the economic impacts

47

of  ITAR  and  export  controls.  The  belief  at  the  time  was  that  we  should  endure  the
economic costs to preserve national security. Nobody can fault the philosophy of put-
ting  national  security  before  economics.  However,  this  is  clearly  a  situation  where
it  was  not  an  either/or  dynamic.  The  policies  that  we  have  put  in  place  are  having
severe impacts on both.

In recent years, this committee has focused on America’s ability to compete as the
world continues its transformation into the information age. How we approach edu-
cating  and  developing  our  workforce  is  just  as  important  as  the  approach  we  take
to  global  trade.  We  need  to  increase  and  improve  our  investments  into  RDT&E  to
ensure that these programs continue to attract the best minds, capture the imagina-
tion  and  creativity  of  the  next  generation,  and  provide  the  technological  return  on
investment  that  we  are  enjoying  by  the  foresight  put  in  our  investments  in  these
areas 20 to 30 years ago and longer.

While  these  are  not  irreversible  trends,  further  inaction  will  put  us  dangerously
close  to  the  point  were  it  may  well  be.  Our  course  moving  forward  must  be
proactive. We must change the process and the philosophy that we used in restrict-
ing  technology  sales.  We  should  look  beyond  technology  restrictions,  and  improve
the  intellectual  discourse  in  R&D  in  our  universities,  our  industry  programs,  and
our  federal  research  facilities.  We  should  focus  on  preparing  the  next  generation
workforce to compete in advanced technology industry. This includes loosening visa
constraints,  and  encouraging  the  worlds’  brightest  minds  to  come  to  the  U.S.  We
must also be willing to make long-term investments in R&D and the infrastructure
that supports it.

QUESTIONS  POSED  BY  THE  HOUSE  COMMITTEE  ON  SCIENCE  AND

TECHNOLOGY

1. What  are  the  implications  and  unintended  consequences  of  current  ex-
port  control  policies  and  regulations  on  U.S.  science  and  technology
competitiveness, including its space research activities?
I  believe  some  of  the  more  obvious  include  the  reverse  ‘‘brain  drain,’’  the  loss  of
institutional  knowledge,  the  stifling  of  industrial  advantages  and  entrepreneurial
success,  and  the  strengthening  of  foreign  industrial  competitors  with  the  direct  re-
duction in our own industrial capacity. For example, I think you are also seeing U.S.
industrial space research become even more risk averse because of the reduction of
profit margins for

U.S.  technologies  caused  by  the  increased  competition  and  reduction  of  foreign

markets for U.S. products.

In 2008, the Center for Strategic and International Studies released Health of the
U.S.  Space  Industrial  Base  and  the  Impact  of  Export  Controls,  which  reported  the
findings  of  a  study  specifically  focused  on  this  topic.  I  know  Tom  Young  co-chaired
this study. That working group did an outstanding job of examining the many impli-
cations that export controls have had on the space industry. The conclusions of this
study were startling. The study also identified seven principles, or truths about the
role of space science and technology, and the national space industrial base as they
apply to our national security.

This committee, the Congress and the Administration must consider what is hap-
pening  to  the  U.S.  industrial  base  and  look  at  it  from  more  than  the  economic  per-
spective,  which  in  itself  have  been  detrimental.  It  really  needs  to  be  viewed  from
a  more  inclusive  holistic  view  of  our  national  security  perspective.  Do  our  export
control  policies  help  or  hinder  our  ability  to  design  and  build  the  capabilities  that
we would need to defend ourselves, no matter the adversary?

I think it is important that our national security goals should also ensure a robust
and  sustainable  aerospace  sciences,  technology,  and  industrial  base.  When  you  ex-
amine  those  principles  defined  in  the  CSIS  study,  you  cannot  help  but  to  realize
how  imperative  this  point  is.  We  must  stop  looking  at  these  issues  from  a  stand-
point  of  what  it  will  cost,  or  what  we  will  lose  control  of.  Instead,  it  must  become
a  matter  of  what  it  will  cost  to  not  to  take  bold  action,  and  what  will  we  have  left
to maintain.

Whether  we  are  talking  about  creating  this  change  of  course  in  months,  or  over
the  next  several  years,  the  one  thing  that  is  clear  is  that  it  serves  us  no  good  to
do  this  piecemeal.  There  has  to  be  some  real  strategy  with  a  defined  intended  out-
come.
2. The  National  Academies  recently  issued  a  report,  Beyond  ‘‘Fortress
America’’:  National  Security  Controls  on  Science  and  Technology  in  a
Globalized  World.  To  what  extent  would  action  on  the  report’s  rec-
ommendations  help  mitigate  the  unintended  consequences  of  export

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:00 May 16, 2009 Jkt 047610 PO 00000 Frm 00051 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\FULL09\022509\47610 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

controls  on  trade,  and  research  and  education,  including  space  re-
search?
I  don’t  want  to  go  into  a  long  discussion  about  visa  policy  since  that  is  not  the
focus  of  this  hearing.  However,  that  is  a  conversation  this  committee  needs  to  con-
tinue  having.  I  bring  it  up  because  of  the  influence  of  these  federal  policies  on  for-
eign technology professionals and the adverse effects these policies have had on our
science and engineering research base. I sincerely believe that for changes to either
technology  or  the  human  capital  associated  with  technology  to  be  successful,  you
must also make modifications to the both. The 2007 National Academies report, Ris-
ing Above the Gathering Storm, that study group made several recommendations to
improve national visa policy that would increase the flow of intellectual talent com-
ing to and remaining in the U.S. to train, work, and teach. If we are going to regain
our role as the recognized leader in research and development then we must reverse
the barriers to foreign technology professionals thriving in the U.S. to create the ad-
vantage  of  the  international  ‘‘brain  drain’’  from  overseas  that  we  enjoyed  from  the
1940s through the 1970s.

In  Recommendation  3  of  the  ‘‘Fortress  America’’  report,  the  authors  specified  ac-
tion items that mirror those earlier recommendations from the Gathering Storm re-
port.  We  need  to  provide  the  opportunities  for  foreign  talent  to  come  and  stay  in
the U.S. as part of our R&D strategy, and we must ensure that there is a pathway
for them to enter and remain to take advantage of these opportunities.

I  believe  the  recommendations  in  this  report  to  be  sound,  and  a  good  foundation
for  the  fundamental  changes  that  we  must  adopt  if  the  U.S.  is  to  remain  competi-
tive. As I mentioned earlier, I believe that the correct approach will consist of adopt-
ing  changes  in  several  areas  of  federal  policy  including  trade,  RDT&E  investment,
and  visa  policies.  That  approach  must  be  integrated,  and  we  must  be  willing  to
make long-term investments of time and funding to ensure that these policies bring
about those intended objectives for national security and economic stability. I think
we  have  a  lot  of  supporting  documentation,  and  the  real  task  before  us  is  incor-
porating many of these recommendations into a cohesive comprehensive strategy.
3. In your view, what are the most critical issues regarding the export con-
trol  system  that  the  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  should  con-
sider  as  part  of  its  oversight  responsibilities  for  the  Nation’s  civil  and
commercial space programs? What actions, if any, would you expect the
Committee to take?
I  realize  there  are  limitations  due  to  oversight  jurisdictions  placed  on  this  com-
mittee and by jurisdiction given to other congressional committees, and that not all
of the changes that are needed can originate here. But given the role that this com-
mittee  fills  and  comparing  that  especially  to  ‘‘Fortress  America,’’  but  also  with  the
Rising Above the Gathering Storm report, I would recommend starting in four areas.
These  are  not  in  order  of  importance,  but  more  in  order  with  what  is  practical  and
can be implemented more rapidly.

First,  we  need  to  make  certain  that  we  are  committed  to  the  ideals  of  initiatives
such as the America COMPETES Act, and really invest in our education system and
workforce. We need to create and support programs and facilities that captivate our
students at a young age with hands-on instruction and training, so that we are de-
veloping  a  home-grown  workforce  that  is  enthusiastic  and  capable  in  science,  tech-
nology,  engineering,  and  mathematics.  They  will  be  the  foundation  for  our  nation’s
ability  to  compete  and  excel  in  an  evermore-competitive  global  marketplace.  We
must  ensure  that  future  generations  of  the  U.S.  technology  workforce  are  able  to
sustain and build upon the advances that our nation has achieved.

Next,  I  believe  this  committee  can  encourage  global  engagement  in  science  and
technology.  We  need  to  once  again  invest  in  our  research  &  test  facilities  to  make
them  attractive  to  international  collaborators  and  researchers.  We  need  to  develop
policies that allow and encourage U.S. researchers to talk and share ideas, findings,
and recommendations without a fear of violating U.S. trade policy. We need to make
certain that the U.S. is once again considered a valued and necessary research part-
ner in international collaborations.

Third,  I  believe  that  the  Committee  can  support  appropriate  changes  to  current
visa policies to promote access and inclusion of international students and research-
ers  into  U.S.  colleges  and  universities,  industry  research  programs,  and  federal  re-
search  programs  and  facilities.  This  will  help  us  to  insure  that  the  talent  pool  par-
ticipating  in  U.S.  research  continues  to  be  drawn  from  among  the  brightest  in  the
world, so as to reduce the capable talent available to foreign competitors, and chal-
lenge  the  perspectives  and  paradigms  of  American-produced  scientists  and  engi-
neers, improving the overall quality of their research.

Finally,  and  most  directly  related  to  the  export  control  system,  I  think  the  Com-
mittee  can  be  instrumental  in  prescribing  a  process  by  which  the  Administration
can  review  and  update  technology  and  their  components  lists  on  a  regular  basis,
streamline the several lists for some uniformity, and standardize licensing consider-
ations  and  requirements.  I  agree  with  the  report’s  recommendation  that  this  needs
to  be  done  with  a  focus  on  understanding  why  items  should  or  should  not  continue
to  be  controlled,  rather  than  on  adding  components  to  an  increasingly  restrictive
and misunderstood list.
4. In the absence of any changes to export control policies and regulations,
what  is  the  outlook  for  the  competitiveness  of  our  space  industry,  our
ability  to  execute  U.S.  Government-funded  space  programs,  and  our
overall leadership in space over the next five years?
Without  a  change  of  course,  we  will  certainly  witness  dramatic  changes  in  our
competitiveness  and  level  of  superiority.  We  are  really  talking  about  generational
effects, well beyond five years.

When  the  European  Union  brokered  an  agreement  on  aerospace  R&D,  European
Vision  2020  was  designed  with  the  goal  of  developing  an  aerospace  sector  that
would  be  unrivaled  even  by  the  U.S.  Their  partnerships  and  collaborative  agree-
ments have allowed Europeans access to state-of-the-art facilities where world-class
research  is  being  conducted.  When  this  was  first  brokered,  American  aerospace  ex-
ecutives  believed  their  hold  on  aerospace  markets  to  be  too  great  to  be  concerned
by  the  Europeans’  aspirations.  It  took  a  decade  from  their  original  declaration  for
Airbus to surpass Boeing in annual global sales.

‘‘ITAR-free’’  marketing  is  designed  specifically  to  compete  with  U.S.  systems  and
components  with  contracts  that  have  much  less  regulation,  and  can  be  completed
in a much shorter timeline. These are policies developed specifically to make the Eu-
ropean  manufacturers  a  more  attractive  alternative  to  U.S.  industry  and  the  mar-
keting  has  been  very  successful,  even  for  almost  purely  commercial  products.  The
effect  has  been  a  dwindling  U.S.  industrial  base  largely  dependent  on  government
contracts to keep production lines open.

The policies we have implemented that have sent us on this path were not estab-
lished for a five-year course. As we have ceded superiority in space technologies, we
have  seen  growth  of  competencies  around  the  world  increase  significantly.  While  it
has taken some of these federal policies 20 and in some cases 40 years to take their
real  toll,  now  that  we  are  at  this  point,  we  are  now  seeing  rapid  technology  gains
around the world and more rapid deterioration within our own industrial base. Na-
tions and companies no longer need to come to the U.S. for our knowledge, facilities,
or technology because our restrictions and their own advancing technology. As they
continue  to  institutionalize  their  education,  research,  and  manufacturing  capacity,
they  will  gain  a  greater  edge.  To  be  direct,  we  will  be  noticeably  less  competitive
in  five  years  without  a  change  in  course  and  far  more  so  in  ten,  15,  20  years  and
beyond.  The  issue  is  whether  the  U.S.  is  willing  to  invest  in  regaining  that  superi-
ority or whether we will continue to shield our eyes from this glaring problem, and
see our capacity and capabilities continue to whither.

DISCUSSION

Chair GORDON. Thank you, General Dickman. Unfortunately, we
are  going  to  be  having  a  series  of  votes  coming  up  soon,  and  this
is a very, very important hearing. But I am going to try to expedite
things  for  everybody’s  convenience.  So  I  had  my  say,  although  I
have some questions, but I am going to skip myself now and move
to Ms. Giffords and recognize her for first questions.

EXECUTIVE ORDER RELATING TO RELIEF FOR UNIVERSITIES

Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate your bringing
such a distinguished panel of speakers today on this incredibly im-
portant  topic.  I  know  that  export  controls  is  not  the  subject  that
most  Americans  are  having  around  their  dining  room  table  every
night.  However,  they  probably  should  be  because  as  the  testimony
from the gentlemen today really indicated, this is an incredibly im-
portant  aspect  of  our  economy,  our  national  security,  and  the  way
we  became  as  prosperous  as  a  nation  because  of  its  focus  on  space
and exploration and certainly science and technology.

My  first  question  is  for  Dr.  Canizares.  In  terms  of  the  National
Academy  report  that  identified  several  challenges  that  export  con-
trols  present  for  universities  in  carrying  out  the  fundamental  re-
search  and  education  for  the  next  generation,  if  President  Obama
implements  the  recommendations  of  the  National  Academy’s  re-
port,  can  you  talk  about  how  much  relief  will  actually  be  provided
to the universities?

Dr. CANIZARES. Thank you for the question. I think that the rec-
ommendations  in  the  report  would  be  a  very  important  step.  How-
ever, the real issue with the implementation of the fundamental re-
search exclusion is how it gets implemented over and over and over
again  in  numerous  contracts,  awards,  technical  interchanges.  And
one  of  the  difficulties  has  been  that  with  the  philosophy,  as  Gen-
eral  Scowcroft  indicated,  of  primarily  sort  of  trying  to  contain  ev-
erything, we have managed to do what was described in the report
that  Norm  Augustine  put  out  recently  from  the  Department  of
Commerce  who  quoted  George  Bundy  saying  if  you  protect  your
diamonds  and  your  toothbrushes  with  equal  zeal,  you  will  lose
fewer  toothbrushes  but  more  diamonds.  And  I  think  in  that  sense,
unfortunately,  that  is  largely  what  has  happened.  And  so  in  the
case  of  ITAR,  we  have  many  space  projects  where  technical  infor-
mation simply on, you know, where to put the screw holes to attach
your scientific instruments to a satellite is ITAR-controlled and not
available  to  a  graduate  student  who  would  be  normally  be  drilling
the holes.

And  therefore,  I  think  the  real  key  will  be  to  have  a  change  in
mindset  that  encourages  all  the  contracting  officers,  all  the  agen-
cies,  to  really  implement  with  proper  attention  the  intent  of  keep-
ing as much open as can be kept open. That will be a difficult, long
process,  but  with  the  attention  of  this  committee  and  we  hope  of
many  others  in  the  government,  it  is  achievable  but  it  will  take
some time.

INTERNATIONAL DUAL-USE TECHNOLOGY BALANCE

Ms.  GIFFORDS.  Following  that  for  members  of  the  panel,  I  know
that  we  will  not  be  able  to  take  a  go-it-alone  approach  when  it
comes  to  space  initiatives  that  we  plan  to  pursue,  including  the
human exploration of the moon, beyond obviously the Mars sample
return,  global  climate  change.  I  am  curious  about  the  balance  of
our  desire  to  cooperate  with  emerging  space-faring  nations  like
China  and  perhaps  India  on  specific  projects  against  concerns
about that dual-use nature of some of those nations’ activities. And
certainly  we  have  seen  other  countries,  specifically  Iran  for  exam-
ple,  launch  a  satellite,  and  we  know  that  the  quest  of  those  who
control  the  skies  control  the  battlefields.  If  members  of  the  panel
could talk about that balance?

Mr.  YOUNG.  I  will  try  and  then  others  may  want  to  comment.  I
think in my opening remarks, there are things that need to be con-
trolled, and so I don’t want to leave the impression that, you know,
we are advocating abolishing controls. But the advantages of inter-
national  cooperation  are  enormous,  not  only  technologically  but
above  and  beyond  as  a  policy,  part  of  our  foreign  policy.  I  think  if
we go back and take a look at even at the height of the Cold War,
as  General  Scowcroft  was  talking  about,  our  cooperative  arrange-
ments with the Soviet Union on things like Apollo-Soyuz and other
programs  were  extraordinarily  mutually  beneficial.  And  I  think
that,  you  know,  we  gave  us  a  stronger  appreciation  of  some  of  the
things that were going on with their programs and vice versa with-
out  compromising  our  national  security.  So  I  think  relative  to  ad-
versaries, I personally am an advocate that we cooperate there but
we  do  it  in  a  very  thoughtful  manner  which  is  what  you  are  sug-
gesting.

But equally important is—our current controls have really an ad-
verse  impact  on  cooperating  with  our  friends,  and  I  will  give  you,
you  know,  a  few  examples.  One  is  that  if  we  sat  down  today  and
developed  a  relationship  with  the  most  friendly  of  countries  for  a
space  program  and  after  we  had  reached  all  the  conclusions,  then
we  give  this  country  a  raft  of  documents,  I  guess  technical  assist-
ant  agreements.  And  if  you  scan  through  them,  you  know,  they
sure  don’t  communicate  that  this  partner  is  a  true  partner.  And
they  sign  away  an  awful  lot.  You  know,  partners  say  why  in  the
world  after  I  have  reached  all  these  agreements,  you  know,  do  I
need to go through that aspect of it?

Let me give you one more example. Today on the Atlas 5, we use
a  Russian  engine  called  the  RD–180.  The  people  who  were  doing
that  program  selected  it  because  they  concluded  it  was  one  of  the
world’s  best  engines.  You  might  say  it  fit  my  earlier  comment  of
being  a  technology  vacuum  cleaner  in  that  regard.  But  if  we  have
a launch problem, we cannot sit down—this is a Russian-developed,
Russian-produced  engine,  we  cannot  sit  down  with  them  and  have
a  discussion  as  to  what  the  problem  is  without  having  a  new  li-
cense  to  establish  it.  It  goes  even  further  if  I  may  just  add  one
other. Tommy Holloway who many of you know who managed both
the  shuttle  program  and  the  International  Space  Station  program,
chaired  a  study  recently  and  said  that  this  inability  to  do  problem
resolution in a real-time fashion added enormously to the risk asso-

ciated with flying on the International Space Station. I could go on
and on.

Chair  GORDON.  Yes,  well,  thank  you,  Mr.  Young.  We  were  going
to  try  to  beat  the  bells.  Mr.  Hall,  you  are  recognized  for  five  min-
utes.

DIFFERENTIATING MILITARY WEAPONS AND DUAL-USE

TECHNOLOGY

Mr.  HALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair.  I  want  to  ask  some  of  you
about  the  military  components.  The  Fortress  America  report  rec-
ommends that export controls, ‘‘treat weapons separately but define
them narrowly and precisely.’’ I guess my question is how does this
process  distinguish  between  a  weapons  system  and  a  component
that  might  be  integral  to  the  system?  I  remember  somehow  about
the  CAT  scan  and  when  it  came  aboard.  Medical  production  and
medical people and maybe some folks that think different to others
of  us  that  don’t  recognize  barters.  They  want  to  share  break-
throughs like that with the nations of the world because it is med-
ical and it helps everybody in the world. But I believe I remember
and  either  you  generals  might  remember  or  you  other  men,  when
the  CAT  scan  came  on,  we  didn’t  share  that  with  anyone  because
about  15  percent  of  the  technology  there  was  involved  in  the  M–
1  bomb  or  the  M–2  bomb  or  whatever  it  was  that  was  powerful  at
that time. It is shared with the world now, but that is just the kind
of  thing  I  am  asking  about,  how  this  might  distinguish  between  a
weapons system and any components that might be integral to the
system  like  that  part  of  the  CAT  scan  was.  General,  do  you  want
to give that——

Lieutenant  General  SCOWCROFT.  Well,  Mr.  Hall,  let  me  take  a

Mr. HALL. I remember it, and I remember Phil Barnaro, too——
Lieutenant  General  SCOWCROFT.  What  our  study  is  dealing  with
is  not  items  that  are  under  the  military  classification  system,  a
weapons  system  or  essential  component  parts,  if  it  is  a  screw  that
holds  things  together.  That  is  something  else,  but  only  those  dual-
use items where they have a commercial use and they have a valid
military use. And our tendency now is not to let anything out.

Mr. HALL. That describes the CAT scan.
Lieutenant  General  SCOWCROFT.  Well,  it  does  describe  the  CAT

crack at it.

scan.

Mr. HALL. But we found a way, or someone found a way to share
that  with  the  world,  and  I  don’t  object  to  that  because  I  think  the
secrecy of the type bomb mechanism is outside our borders, too.

Lieutenant  General  SCOWCROFT.  Look,  we  are  not  going  to  solve
all of these problems, and there are problems to distinguish. What
we  are  saying  is  let  us  try  to  make  those  distinctions  clear  and
more  apparent  and  not  simply  say  we  put  the  blanket  over  every-
thing  and  we  don’t 
can
demonstrate——

let  everything  go  unless  you 

Mr. HALL. General, thank you. Thank you, sir.
Lieutenant General SCOWCROFT.—where it should go.
Mr. HALL. I have used three minutes. Could I yield my two min-

utes to Mr. Rohrabacher? He is hurting.

Chair GORDON. Sure.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Thank  you  very  much,  and  thank  you  both,
the  Chair  and  the  Ranking  Member,  for  this  very  important  hear-
ing  and  the  courtesy  they  have  displayed  to  me  to  let  me  have  a
chance to ask a couple questions and to give an opening statement.

DUAL-TRACK EXPORT CONTROL SYSTEMS

First and foremost, let me just note I represent a district that is
very rich in aerospace technology, and I take the employment of my
constituents  very  seriously.  And  I  realize  the  issues  that  you
brought up today are risking—we are putting at risk our aerospace
industry  and  the  jobs  of  all  of  my  people  by  having  an  irrational
ITAR  regulation  system.  We  understand  that.  What  direction  are
we  going  to  go,  how  do  we  get  out  of  it  is  a  whole  other  issue  and
quite frankly, I believe that we have had these restrictions because
there  was  a  transfer  of  technology  20  years  ago  during  the  1990’s
to  a  potential  enemy  of  the  United  States,  China.  And  all  of  your
suggestions  about  how  we  need  to  work  with  the  people  overseas
is  absolutely  correct  for  the  health  of  our  industry.  But  I  take  it
that  none  of  you  believe  that  the  United  States  should  be  working
and  having  this  possibility  of  transferring  technology  in  order  to
get a contract or to build your industries at the expense of building
up the capabilities of Iran or North Korea or some enemy like that
which  is  clearly  an  enemy  of  the  United  States.  But  with  China,
no  one  wants  to  face  that.  Let  me  just  ask  down  the  line,  would
you  be  willing  to  try,  in  order  to  open  up  trade,  high-tech  indus-
tries and the type of business that we need to do to keep our aero-
space  industry  and  other  high-tech  industries  competitive.  Would
you be willing to have a dual-track system which places heavier re-
strictions  on  trade  with  non-democratic  countries  like  China,  and
including  China,  versus  having  just  the  idea  that  we  have  to  open
up and loosen up the controls for everybody?

Chair  GORDON.  Mr.  Hall’s  time  is  up,  so  if  you  would,  I  think
that deserves an answer but if you could move forward maybe with
an answer.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Could I just have a yes or no from the panel?
Would  you  be  willing  to  have  tougher  controls  on  China  and  other
potential  enemies  versus  ITAR  that  would  have  to  be  opened,  just
overall change?

Lieutenant General SCOWCROFT. I don’t want to answer yes or no

because I think it is a more complicated question.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay. I don’t think it is, General. I am sorry.
What would be your answer? This is not a complicated issue. Why
don’t  we  have  tighter  controls  on  an  issue  that  poses  a  potential
danger to our country than we do with democratic countries?

Dr. CANIZARES. Yes, I believe we should, and certainly all the ex-
port regulations have that, and in fact the recommendations of our
report also allow for it.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. So we should still have controls——
Dr. CANIZARES. I will not decide which countries—it is not at all
appropriate for me to decide which countries should be on the list.
However——

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  All  right.  So  the  answer  is  yes,  we  should

have a dual system.

Dr. CANIZARES. Yes.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Young.
Mr. YOUNG. Yes, I think we should have a dual system, but like

General Scowcroft, it is more involved in the answer——
EXPORT CONTROL DANGERS WITH THE CHINESE

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Nobody wants to say China. The bottom line
is  our  major  industries  are  making  billions  of  dollars  off  of  trade
with China that could potentially cause damage to our national se-
curity.  When  our  businessmen  acknowledge  that,  we  are  going  to
have  some  progress  on  this.  Until  then,  we  are  going  to  have  con-
trols because the American people can’t count on our big business-
men to watch out for the security interests of our country over tem-
porary and short-term profit.

Mr. HALL. I yield back my time.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. That is what this is all about.
Lieutenant General SCOWCROFT. Mr. Rohrabacher, if the Chinese
can get the same product from the British or the French that they
could  get  from  us,  then  we  don’t  solve  your  problem  but  we  injure
the  American  economic  competitiveness.  That  is  why  it  is  a  com-
plicated answer.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. I will tell you——
Chair  GORDON.  Mr.  Rohrabacher,  if  you  would  yield,  it  is  really

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.—in  aiding  Adolf  Hitler  because  the  French

a——

have been aiding Adolf Hitler——

Chair  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Rohrabacher.  There  are  a  lot  of
nuances  to  this,  and  it  is  unfortunate  that  we  are  under  this  gun
because  this  does  need  to  be  discussed  more.  But  we  are  going  to
try to keep some regular order.

Ms.  Dahlkemper,  did  you  have  a  question  that  you  wanted  to—
okay.  Mr.  Smith,  did  you  have  a—well,  Mr.  Rohrabacher,  would
you like to rant just a little bit longer?

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Listen,  again,  my  people  are  aerospace  em-
ployees, and I am very concerned about the issues they brought up.
Chair GORDON. Why don’t you—okay. Why don’t we—Mr. Young?
Mr.  YOUNG.  Yeah,  I  would  like  to  respond  because  I  think  the
comments  are  quite  good.  I  really  want  to  highlight  the  fact  that
the reason, the primary reason in my view for making the changes
we are talking about, is not American industry, it is national secu-
rity.  And  our  concern,  when  we  really  got  into  this,  and  it  is  no
matter what country we are dealing with, the way we are currently
implementing  our  export  controls  is  having  a  detrimental  effect  on
our national security. In other words, I think if we make a mistake,
I  would  be  in  favor  of  making  a  mistake  on  the  conservative  side
relative  to  not  harming  national  security.  But  what  alarmed  us,
when we really got into this, is that the way we are currently going
about  it,  including  even  with  adversaries,  is  we  are  doing  it  in  a
manner  that  has  a  negative  impact  on  our  national  security.  If  I
could just add one item, not an adversary, but we had various for-
eign governments come in and talk to us. Indian government came
in  and  talked  to  us.  They  said  the  best  thing  that  ever  happened
to  them  was  ITAR,  that  it  accelerated  their  program  beyond  what
would  have  ever  been  possible  if  it  had  not  been  for  U.S.  export

controls.  The  reason  I  point  that  out  is  that  that  really  is  a  broad
way that it is being implemented.

Chair GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Young.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. But don’t you think——
Chair GORDON. Mr. Rohrabacher, if I could just——
Mr. ROHRABACHER. I thought I was going to rant some more.

CONCLUSION OF HEARING

Chair  GORDON.  Well,  you  had  your  opportunity.  We  only  have
four  minutes  and  45  seconds  to  go.  As  I  said  earlier,  this  really  is
just not fair. I mean, this is such an important question. There are
lots  of  nuances.  As  we  stated  earlier,  though,  this  is  sort  of  the
opening, and I am glad that hopefully we can, this committee hear-
ing, has put it on the table. There needs to be other hearings. This
needs  to  be  something  that  is  talked  about.  I  am  going  to  contact
the President and ask him to—once again, as we sit in this, in our
earlier  to  our  authorization  last  year  is  that  they  need  to  take  a
quick look at this, or not a quick look, I mean they need to quickly
start  to  take  a  serious  look  at  this.  But  as  today,  I  am  afraid  that
we are going to have to come to conclusion. The record will remain
open  for  two  weeks  for  additional  statements  for  Members  and  for
answers  to  any  of  the  follow-up  questions  the  Committee  might
ask. And Mr. Rohrabacher, the witnesses would welcome you to go
down  and  have  a  conversation  as  we  continue  with  going  to  vote.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. All right.
Chair GORDON. And again, I thank all of you. The witnesses are

excused.

[Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Lieutenant  General  Brent  Scowcroft  (USAF,  Ret.),  President  and

Founder, The Scowcroft Group

Questions submitted by Chair Bart Gordon
Q1. In discussing the Presidential Executive Order recommended by your committee,
the report states: ‘‘Not only will these reforms support economic vitality and pro-
mote national security, but they will create a track record and experience base
that  Congress  can  evaluate—and  modify  as  it  sees  fit.’’  What  should  Congress
look  for  in  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  changes  to  the  export  control  system
directed  in  such  an  Executive  Order,  should  the  President  decide  to  issue  one?
a. At  what  point  after  the  proposed  Order  is  put  into  effect  should  Congress  ex-

pect to see improvements?

A1. The changes that the report proposes are intended to make the export licensing
system  easier  to  navigate  because  the  ‘‘one-stop-shop’’  coordinating  center  will  re-
duce the bureaucratic ambiguity that both industry and the agencies currently expe-
rience.  Over  time,  these  should  lead  to  such  quantifiable  improvements  as  shorter
license-processing  times,  increased  defense  industry  cooperation  among  allies,  and
up-to-date controls lists (both the CCL and the USML). The report does not specify
when improvements should become evident; however, in my view, nine-months from
the  time  that  the  system  is  fully  operational  should  be  sufficient  to  begin  to  see
positive changes.
Q2. Your  prepared  statement  notes  that  ‘‘the  most  significant  challenge  to  imple-
menting  these  [National  Academies]  recommendations  is  to  help  the  relevant
agencies understand that these reforms will not micro-manage their own licens-
ing procedures or challenge agency expertise.’’ Do you have any specific sugges-
tions on how to address this challenge?

A2. Although the report does not address this issue, members of the committee are
conducting briefings throughout the relevant agencies to explain that the new proc-
esses do not change how each agency conducts its own licensing reviews. This expla-
nation should be included in any materials that accompany the launch of the coordi-
nating center and licensing appeals panel.
Q3. Dr.  Canizares’  testimony  suggests  that  some  of  the  actions  our  committee  could
take  to  address  the  impacts  of  export  controls  include  1)  endorsing  the  rec-
ommendations  in  the  National  Academies  report  and  2)  requiring  that  each
agency  under  our  jurisdiction  develop  and  implement  a  plan  to  execute  the  rec-
ommendations  and  report  to  Congress  on  their  progress.  Do  you  agree  with  Dr.
Canizares’ suggestions? Are there other actions this committee could take, within
its  jurisdiction,  to  address  the  impacts  of  export  controls  on  science  and  tech-
nology competitiveness and to ensure America’s leadership in space?

A3. It  would  certainly  be  beneficial  for  this  committee  to  endorse  these  rec-
ommendations.

Dr.  Canizares  has  explained  what  he  meant  by  the  part  of  his  testimony  that
would  require  ‘‘each  agency  under  our  jurisdiction  [to]  develop  and  implement  a
plan to execute the recommendations and report to Congress on their progress.’’ He
was not referring to agencies that administer and enforce export controls, but rather
to  those  that  conduct  and  support  research  (at  universities  and  industry).  He  gave
as  an  example,  the  2008  John  Young  Memo  that  reaffirmed  ‘‘free  scientific  ex-
changes and dissemination of research results to the maximum extent possible.’’ He
would  like  to  see  agencies  being  asked  to  explicitly  meet  our  recommendation  for
reaffirming  the  Fundamental  Research  Exemption  (NSDD  189).  I  think  this  is  a
very good idea.
Q4. Your  committee’s  report  recommends  that  sunset  requirements  be  applied  to  all
items on export control lists that are controlled unilaterally by the U.S. Who did
the committee think should review the lists to be in compliance with the report’s
recommendation for sunsetting?
a. Does this recommendation for sunsetting apply only to the Commerce Control

List or does it also apply to the ITAR?

b. Would  satellites  be  covered  under  the  sunset  requirements?  If  not,  did  the
Committee  consider  what  actions  are  necessary  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of
export controls for satellites and satellite components?

A4. The  report  proposes  that  the  coordinating  committee  should  have  oversight  of
the  ‘‘sunset’’  process  but  does  not  get  more  specific  than  that  regarding  who  ought
to  participate  in  the  process.  In  my  view,  the  technical  expertise  of  those  who  are
directly involved in research (from university, national and commercial laboratories)
is an essential component of this process. While the report is not specific as to who
should  participate,  it  discusses  an  approach  that  includes  several  of  the  principles
listed  in  Recommendation  #1  and  the  proposed  Economic  Competitiveness  Exemp-
tion.

The  sunset  process  is  intended  to  be  applied  to  both  the  Commerce  Control  List
and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. The report does not discuss sat-
ellites  per  se  because  they  are  covered  by  statute,  but  in  my  own  view,  yes,  they
should be included under sunset requirements.
Q5. The National Academies report recommends the creation of a Coordinating Cen-
ter  for  Export  Controls  to  receive  applications,  determine  agency  jurisdiction,
maintain  timetables  on  license  application  processing,  and  managing  the  ap-
peals  process,  for  example.  How  big  of  an  operation  would  this  be?  What  is  re-
quired for the Center to be successful?
a. If both the federal agencies that administer export control regulations and the
export  control  license  applicants  can  appeal  decisions  on  licenses  and  on
whether sunset requirements have been properly implemented, what measures
are  in  place  to  ensure  that  the  appeals  process  recommended  in  the  report
does not become overly burdened and time-consuming?

A5. Although  it  is  not  discussed  in  the  report,  the  committee  recommends  that  the
coordinating  center  should  be  a  small  administrative  office.  In  order  for  the  coordi-
nating center to be successful, the report specifies that the coordinating center’s di-
rector  should  have  binding  authority  (1)  to  determine  which  agency—Commerce  or
State—will  review  a  particular  application,  and  (2)  to  establish  default-to-decision
orders with respect to licensing decision timetables and sunsetting timetables.

The report does not discuss in detail how to prevent the appeals process from be-
coming  over-burdened.  However,  the  committee  believes  that  the  establishment  of
an  appeals  process  that  does  not  reside  in  Commerce,  State  or  Defense  and  does
reside  in  the  National  Security  Council  will  dampen  the  tendency  to  abuse  the  ap-
peals process.
Q6. During  the  hearing,  Congressman  Rohrabacher  stated  that  ‘‘the  American  peo-
ple  can’t  count  on  our  big  businessmen  to  watch  out  for  the  security  interests
of our country over temporary and short-term profit.’’ How, if at all, would im-
plementation of the recommendations in your report address this concern?

A6. The report does not recommend an end to export controls, but to implement ‘‘re-
forms  based  on  the  realities  of  the  risks  and  opportunities  of  today’s  threats  to  the
Nation.’’  Nor  does  the  report  recommend  putting  industrial  stakeholders  in  charge
of  any  aspect  of  the  export  control  process.  Indeed,  the  recommendations  proposed
in  the  report  would  not  make  it  any  easier  for  American  businessmen  to  ignore  or
undermine  export  control  policy.  In  fact,  the  system  would  very  likely  close  some
loopholes that currently exist because of the multi-agency application process. Also,
many businesses would no longer be compelled to build research laboratories outside
the United States in order to get around export controls.
Q7. To what extent do current American export controls prevent China from gaining

access to advanced technologies?
a. How would the approach recommended in Beyond ‘‘Fortress America’’ protect

U.S. technologies from being exploited by China?

A7. The United States and its allies do not see eye-to-eye on selling advanced ‘‘dual-
use’’ goods and technologies to China. For example, as stated in the report: ‘‘despite
U.S. protests on the transfer of dual-use technology, the European Union signed an
agreement  with  China  in  2003  that  allowed  China  to  invest  230  million  Euros  in
the  European  Union’s  satellite  navigation  system.’’  Furthermore,  China  is  able  to
buy U.S. products from third country manufacturers who are the original legal buy-
ers; there are no international legal restraints to prevent this. Thus it is a mistake
to  think  that  withholding  U.S.  products  from  the  Chinese  actually  prevents  them
from getting the same advanced ‘‘dual-use’’ goods elsewhere.

The  report  does  not  deal  specifically  with  China’s  efforts  to  gain  access  to  Amer-
ican  advanced  technologies  that  could  have  a  military  purpose.  However,  it  articu-
lates  the  need  to  redesign  the  multi-lateral  regimes,  such  as  the  Wassenaar  Ar-
rangement, in ways that will better respond to today’s globalized and threat-diffuse
world.

Questions submitted by Representative Gabrielle Giffords
Q1. Your testimony states that ‘‘If we sustain these export control and visa barriers,
we will increasingly lose touch with the cutting edge of science and technology,
and  we  risk  missing  emerging  national  security  threats.’’  Could  you  elaborate
on this point, especially with respect to emerging national security threats?

A1. The  emerging  threats  in  my  statement  refer  to  technological  advances  taking
place elsewhere that could weaken America’s position in the battlefield, and to tech-
nologies  that  could  have  catastrophic  consequences  if  unleashed  on  the  American
population.  As  the  report  states,  ‘‘[w]hile  the  United  States  remains  a  world  leader
in  advanced  science  and  technology,  it  no  longer  dominates;  it  is  now  among  the
leaders.  We  are  increasingly  interdependent  with  the  rest  of  the  world.’’  Therefore
advanced science and technology will develop in the United States, but also, for ex-
ample, in China, Germany, India, and Russia. If export controls prevent foreign sci-
entists  from  coming  here  to  study,  or  from  collaborating  with  American  scientists,
the United States will lose vital information about what is going on elsewhere.
Q2. The  State  Department  maintains  a  Technology  Alert  List  (TAL)  which  estab-
lishes  a  list  of  major  fields  of  technology  transfer  concern.  That  list  expanded
greatly  after  9/11,  and  some  have  argued  that  it  is  too  exhaustive.  As  a  result,
consular officers with little or no scientific training of their own will request an
additional  review,  called  a  Visa  Mantis  review,  for  the  overwhelming  majority
of  visa  applicants  with  advanced  science  and  engineering  degrees.  However,
what  is  being  recommended  in  the  National  Academies  report  seems  to  be  the
opposite  approach:  preferential  treatment  for  those  with  advanced  STEM  de-
grees,  with  no  discussion  at  all  of  security  concerns  or  of  how  to  achieve  im-
provements  within  the  current  system.  Can  you  elaborate  on  how  you  ap-
proached your recommendations with respect to visas?

A2. With  all  due  respect,  the  question  is  a  mischaracterization  of  the  committee’s
recommendations  with  regard  to  visas.  The  report  does  not  seek  in  any  way  to  end
the screening process, but to make it more rational, so that ‘‘legitimate and qualified
students  and  researchers’’  (emphasis  added)  can  attend  school,  attend  conferences,
and ultimately seek employment. For example, see Recommendation 4 which states
that  ‘‘The  committee  recommends  the  President’s  Executive  Order  require  that  a
non-immigrant visa applicant who is a graduate student, researcher, or professional
in any field of science or technology, and whose application is supported by a quali-
fied university, scientific body, or corporation receive a determination on the visa ap-
plication  within  30  days’’  (emphasis  added).  The  recommendation  also  affirms  that
graduates should be eligible for employment only after the ‘‘pass security screening
measures.’’  The  vouching  process  that  is  recommended  is  not  meant  to  replace
screening measures, but to augment them.

As has been the case throughout its history, ‘‘It is important to both the national
security and to our country’s economic prosperity to maintain the flow of human tal-
ent into the United States.’’
Q3. One  of  the  visa  recommendations  in  the  National  Academies  report  calls  for  an
executive  order  requiring  determination  on  visa  applications  for  scientists  and
engineers within 30 days provided the application is supported by a U.S. univer-
sity, scientific body, or corporation. In the report, it is noted that this is already
common  practice  and  few  reviews  slip  beyond  30  days.  If  that  is  the  case,  are
there  more  specific  recommendations  to  the  relevant  agencies  to  mitigate  those
few delays that do still occur?

A3. The current system works for 95 percent of visa applications; however, the dif-
ficult  five  percent  is  precisely  the  population  with  which  the  report  is  concerned—
scientific students, researchers and professionals. The report does not specify actions
that the relevant agencies need to take.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. You  state  that  the  export  control  system  is  ‘‘broken,’’  that  it  is  slowly  wiping
away any technological advantages we may have once had, and is crippling our
ability  to  maintain  superiority.  The  Fortress  America  report  proposes  changes
that  could  be  implemented  using  existing  Executive  authorities  to  improve  the
export  license  process.  If  the  Administration  were  to  embrace  the  report’s  rec-
ommendations, from the applicants’ perspective, what improvements would like-
ly result?

61

A1. The changes recommended in the report will bring about greater transparency,
openness,  consistency  and  agility,  all  of  which  are  lacking  in  the  current  system.
The  ‘‘one-stop-shop’’  will  reduce  licensing  timetables  and  therefore  promote  consist-
ency  and  agility.  The  appeals  process,  which  recommends  publication  of  decisions,
will promote transparency and openness. A process that applies principled and con-
sistent  sunset  requirements  will  be  able  to  bring  about  consistency  and  rationality.
The  Economic  Competitiveness  Exemption  will  make  the  system  more  realistic  be-
cause  it  takes  into  account  the  fact  that  the  U.S.  gains  no  significant  protection  by
prohibiting  legitimate  U.S.  companies  from  exporting  dual-use  items  that  are,  or
soon will be, legally available in open markets overseas.
Q2. What  would  be  the  best  approach  to  conduct  the  first  round  of  ‘sunset’  reviews
for  items  currently  on  export  control  lists?  Presumably,  it  would  be  a  massive
undertaking. Who should populate such a review committee?

A2. The  report  does  not  address  the  specifics  for  how  to  manage  the  first  round  of
‘‘sunset’’  reviews,  although  the  committee  members  agree  that  the  initial  pruning
of the list will be ‘‘arduous.’’

Technical  experts  currently  working  in  their  fields  (see  the  answer  to  Chairman
Gordon’s fourth question) will be essential. Per my colleague, Claude Canizares’ an-
swer  to  Ranking  Member  Hall’s  first  question,  ‘‘the  Emerging  Technology  and  Re-
search  Advisory  Committee  (ETRAC)  recently  established  by  the  Department  of
Commerce’s is currently working to define a methodology that may well be relevant
to reviewing the Commerce Control List and possibly also sections of the Munitions
Control  List.’’  I  would  propose  consideration  of  their  recommendation  as  it  becomes
available.
Q3. Foreign satellite builders have been openly marketing satellites as being ‘‘ITAR-
free.’’ What has been the record of their marketing efforts? Is there any evidence
that  they  are  taking  away  sales  from  U.S.  builders?  Technologically,  how  do
their satellites compare to ours?

A3. I  would  like  to  refer  you  to  the  2008  CSIS  report,  ‘‘Health  of  the  U.S.  Space
Industrial Base and the Impact of Export Controls.’’
Q4. Since imposition of export controls decades ago, is there a public record of opin-
ions  on  licenses  that  would  give  industry  and  academia  roadmaps  about  what
is  acceptable,  and  what  isn’t.  How  transparent  and  consistent  is  the  licensing
process?  To  what  degree  can  applicants  cite  previous  license  approvals  to  gain
quick consideration of similar, pending applications?

A4. It  is  unlikely  that  such  a  record  exists.  The  current  system  is  anything  but
transparent. Because technologies are in a constant state of change, precedents are
not necessarily a useful guide.

Questions submitted by Representative Pete Olson
Q1. What are examples of capabilities in satellite and launch systems where the U.S.

excels and should hold tight to the underlying technologies?

A1. This  issue  is  not  dealt  with  directly  in  the  report,  nor  are  satellites  my  area
of expertise. This is a question that is best put to space scientists.
Q2. In  statements  presented  during  the  hearing,  several  witnesses  cited  difficulties
engaging  in  collaborative  space  research  missions,  given  that  all  U.S.  satellites
are  controlled  by  the  State  Department’s  munitions  list.  Yet  the  State  Depart-
ment  claims  they  have  streamlined  the  licensing  process.  From  your  vantage
point,  has  the  Department  made  real  improvements,  or  is  the  system  still
weighed down with too many uncertainties, making future science collaborations
a difficult proposition?

A2. The State Department has made some changes in response to President Bush’s
January  2008  Presidential  Directives  designed  to  streamline  and  improve  export
control  policies  and  procedures.  These  include  moving  to  an  online  application  sys-
tem  and  correcting  the  severe  backlog  of  applications  from  2006–7.  However,  their
efforts  have  not  addressed  either  the  lack  of  transparency  or  ‘‘commodity  jurisdic-
tion’’  issues—issues  that  are  dealt  with  in  the  committee’s  recommendations.  Thus
while the improvements are real and necessary, they are not sufficient.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by A. Thomas Young, Lockheed Martin Corporation (Ret.); Co-Chair, Cen-
ter for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Working Group on the Health
of the U.S. Space Industrial Base and the Impact of Export Controls

Questions submitted by Chair Bart Gordon
Q1. Dr.  Canizares’  testimony  suggests  that  some  of  the  actions  our  committee  could
take  to  address  the  impacts  of  export  controls  include  1)  endorsing  the  rec-
ommendations  in  the  National  Academies  report  and  2)  requiring  that  each
agency  under  our  jurisdiction  develop  and  implement  a  plan  to  execute  the  rec-
ommendations  and  report  to  Congress  on  their  progress.  Do  you  agree  with  Dr.
Canizares’ suggestions? Are there other actions this committee could take, within
its  jurisdiction,  to  address  the  impacts  of  export  controls  on  science  and  tech-
nology competitiveness and to ensure America’s leadership in space?

A1. I agree with Dr. Canizares’ recommendations.
Q2. The  first  recommendation  of  the  CSIS  working  group  is:  ‘‘The  Administration
and  Congress  should  review  and  reconcile  the  strategic  intent  of  space  export
controls.’’  What  specifically  do  you  think  needs  to  occur  in  such  a.strategic  re-
view  and  what  entity  should  lead  that  effort?  Does  the  strategic  intent  of  space
export  controls  need  to  be  resolved  before  any  structural  changes  to  the  export
control  system  are  put  into  place,  such  as  those  recommended  by  the  National
Academies?

A2. Our view is that the strategic intent of space export controls should be uniquely
to  protect  the  national  security  of  the  U.S.  Current  controls  are  so  broad  and
unfocused that the net result is an erosion of our national security. The administra-
tion and Congress should together make the changes to space export controls to as-
sure the objective stated above is accomplished.

While it would be useful, this issue does not have to be resolved before other im-

portant structural changes are implemented.
Q3. What  specifically  does  the  CSIS  recommend  to  address  concerns  about  the  im-
pact  of  export  controls  on  the  commercial  sale  and  use  of  satellites  for  research
purposes?

A3. Specifically,  the  law  that  makes  satellites  controlled  items  should  be  repealed
and only those elements of satellites that are critical to our national security should
be controlled.
Q4. The CSIS study, as noted in your testimony, refers to the negative impact of ex-
port  controls  on  the  second  and  third  tiers  of  the  aerospace  industry,  which  is
where  much  of  the  innovation  and  global  engagement  in  the  industry  occurs.
How  serious  are  the  impacts  to  innovation  at  this  level  of  industry?  What  does
CSIS recommend to mitigate these impacts?
a. Do  you  have  a  perspective  on  whether  any  weaknesses  in  our  supplier  base
are  causing  U.S.  companies  to  increase  dependencies  on  non-U.S.  suppliers?
A4. The  impact  on  second  and  third  tier  companies  is  severe.  These  companies  re-
quire  both  domestic  and  international  sales  to  be  viable  and  to  be  able  to  invest  in
innovation. Today, we are becoming dependent on, non-U.S. suppliers in areas such
as traveling wave tubes and batteries.
Q5. One of the recommendations of the CSIS study is for relevant space-related gov-
ernment agencies to collaborate on conducting an assessment of the space indus-
trial  base  on  an  annual  basis.  Could  you  elaborate  on  why  an  annual  assess-
ment is needed? How would this information be used in informing export control
regulations? How feasible would it be to carry out such assessments every year?
A5. The CSIS study had a dual objective to assess the health of the space industrial
base and the impact of export controls. A conclusion of the study is that government
funding  directly  defines  the  health  of  the  base.  Periodic  assessments  are  necessary
to  assure  the  base  continues  to  be  healthy  at  the  prime  contractor  level  and  that
appropriate corrective action is being effective at the second and third times.
Q6. The  CSIS  working  group  recommended  that  ‘‘a  special  program  authority  to
permit timely engagement of U.S. participants in multinational space projects’’
be created. Could you please elaborate on the nature of such a program author-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:00 May 16, 2009 Jkt 047610 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\FULL09\022509\47610 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

63

ity and how, in practice, it would work? How broad or narrow should the special
program authority be?

A6. When  the  U.S.  participates  in  a  multinational  space  project  export  controls
have a chilling effect on the partnership. International partners are required to ap-
prove  onerous  documents  above  and  beyond  the  international  agreements  that  de-
fine  the  project.  Anomaly  resolution  cannot  take  place  without  further  approvals.
Meetings  and  meeting  attendees  are  affected.  These  are  some  examples  of  the  ad-
verse  impact  of  space  export  controls  that  cause  potential  international  partners  to
no longer consider the U.S. as the partner of choice.

A solution would be to include export controls that are critical to the U.S. national
security,  as  well  as  those  of  our  partners,  in  the  project  defining  documents  with
implementing  responsibility  assigned  to  the  U.S.  organization  lead  for  the  project.

Questions submitted by Representative Gabrielle Giffords
Q1. The CSIS study on export controls that you co-chaired noted concerns regarding
the negative impact of export controls on selected areas of the space supplier base
such  as  solar  cell  and  solar  cell  substrate  technologies.  These  would  appear  to
be  space  technologies  that  could  have  applications  for  the  development  of  ad-
vanced  renewable  energy  technologies  for  civil  applications.  Can  you  elaborate
on the basis of those concerns?
a. Are you aware of any broader implications of export controls for achieving the
Nation’s  objectives  to  invest  in  ‘‘green  technologies’’  and  renewable  energies?
A1. We did not examine the impact of space export controls on ‘‘green technologies’’
and renewable energies; thus, I cannot elaborate on these concerns.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. What  would  be  the  best  approach  to  conduct  the  first  round  of  ‘sunset’  reviews
for  items  currently  on  export  control  lists?  Presumably,  it  would  be  a  massive
undertaking. Who should populate such a review committee?

A1. The  conduct  of  the  first  round  of  ‘‘sunset’’  reviews  would  be  a  massive  under-
taking but critical to our national security. It should include those organizations re-
sponsible  for  implementing  space  export  controls,  such  as  the  Department  of  State,
and  those  organizations  with  the  capability  of  assessing  technologies  critical  to  our
national security, such as DOD and the NRO.
Q2. Foreign  satellite  builders  have  been  openly  marketing  satellites,as  being  ‘‘ITAR-
free.’’ What has been the record of their marketing efforts? Is there any evidence
that  they  are  taking  away  sales  from  U.S.  builders?  Technologically,  how  do
their satellites compare to ours?

A2. Foreign  commercial  communication  satellites  today  have  comparable  capability
to U.S. satellites. Foreign sales have grown at the expense of U.S. builders.
Q3. Since imposition of export controls decades ago, is there a public record of opin-
ions  on  licenses  that  would  give  industry  and  academia  roadmaps  about  what
is  acceptable,  and  what  isn’t:  How  transparent  and  consistent  is  the  licensing
process?  To  what  degree  can  applicants  cite  previous  license  approval  to  gain
quick consideration of similar, pending applications?

A3. The  licensing  process  is  not  very  transparent,  is  very  time  consuming,  and
while  the  reported  approval  rate  is  very  high  most  approvals  come  with  required
change.  Large  companies  have  learned  to  deal  with  these  difficulties  and  consider
the  associated  impacts  as  a  ‘‘cost  of  doing  business.’’  Again,  the  critical  impact  is
to second and third tier companies.

Questions submitted by Representative Pete Olson
Q1. What are examples of capabilities in satellite and launch systems where the U.S.

excels and should hold tight to the underlying technologies?

A1. Capabilities  that  are  critical  to  our  national  security  should  be  determined  by
our defense and intelligence organizations.
Q2. In  statements  presented  during  the  hearing,  several  witnesses  cited  difficulties

view the process continued to be very onerous.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Claude  R.  Canizares,  Vice  President  for  Research  and  Associate  Pro-

vost, Bruno Rossi Professor of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Questions submitted by Chair Bart Gordon
Q1. Your  testimony  identifies  ‘‘deemed  exports’’  as  particularly  problematic  for  the
academic environment. What types of impacts have ‘‘deemed exports’’ had in the
university environment?
a. Does  National  Academies  study  recommend  any  actions  to  mitigate  these  ef-

fects? If so, please discuss them.

Q2. Your  testimony  notes  that  ‘‘Despite  a  Presidential  directive  protecting  funda-
mental research, export controls continue to inhibit, retard or eliminate univer-
sity  research  projects.’’  Can  you  provide  examples  of  the  negative  impacts  to
clarify the extent of the problem?
a. The  National  Academies  report  recommends  that  the  Fundamental  Research
Exemption be maintained and implemented properly. Your testimony refers to
the need for a ‘‘change in mindset that encourages all the contracting officers,
all  the  agencies,  to  really  implement  with  proper  attention  the  intent  of
keeping as much open as can be kept open.’’ What are your thoughts on any
specific actions that could be taken to help change the mindset?

A1,  2. Because  of  the  similarity  of  Questions  1  and  2,  I  believe  it  would  be  appro-
priate  to  provide  a  single  answer  that  attempts  to  address  all  the  issues  raised  in
both questions.

First,  allow  me  to  note  that  I  use  the  term  ‘‘deemed  export’’  in  its  generic  sense
to encompass both the Department of Commerce Export Administration Regulations
(EAR)  and  the  Department  of  State  International  Traffic  in  Arms  Regulations
(ITAR).  In  ITAR,  transfer  of  technical  information  to  a  non-U.S.  person  within  or
outside the U.S. is referred to as a ‘‘defense service.’’

While  there  has  never  been  a  systematic  study  of  the  impacts  of  deemed  exports
on universities, university researchers have reported serious negative impacts in nu-
merous workshops and other informal venues. For example, see ‘‘Space Science and
the  International  Traffic  in  Arms  Regulations’’  [National  Academies  Press,  2008].
That  workshop  report  lists,  for  example,  the  following  categories  of  impact  in  the
space science arena alone (pp. 16ff): (i) Controls at odds with international character
of science; (ii) Diminishing U.S. access to foreign expertise; (iii) Handicaps on effec-
tive  space-mission  designs;  (iv)  compromising  the  quality  of  student  experience;  (v)
effects of regulatory uncertainties on faculty and staff; (vi) costs and administrative
burden; In fact, many of these same factors also apply to other areas of deemed ex-
port  controls  (such  as  the  control  of  ‘‘use  technology’’  by  the  EAR).  Item  (v)  above
deserves special mention: The ‘‘chilly climate’’ engendered by deemed export controls
dissuades  researchers  and  students  from  undertaking  forefront  research  projects
that might otherwise yield important results for the Nation. I gave one such exam-
ple in my testimony, involving a putative space mission to detect extra-solar planets
that  was  not  conducted  because  of  ITAR’s  perceived  impediments.  In  that  sense,  a
significant  part  of  the  impact  resembles  Sherlock  Holmes’  ‘‘dog  not  barking  in  the
night.’’  It  is  true  that  these  impacts  are  not  easily  quantifiable,  but  all  of  us  in  the
research  university  community  who  deal  with  this  issue  are  convinced  that  the  ag-
gregate impacts are substantial.

The potential impact of a stricter application of deemed export regulations by the
Department  of  Commerce  is  even  more  problematic,  as  it  could  cover  hundreds  to
thousands  of  pieces  of  equipment  on  university  campuses  and  require  thousands  of
licenses.  This  impact  was  chronicled  in  hundreds  of  comments  received  by  DOC  in
response  to  a  Notice  of  Public  Rule  Making  several  years  ago.  This  response  led
DOC  to  form  the  Deemed  Export  Advisory  Committee,  and  more  recently  the
Emerging  Technology  and  Research  Advisory  Committee.  As  a  member  of  ETRAC,
I  am  hopeful  that  some  of  the  potentially  very  negative  effects  that  had  been  fore-
seen  might  be  mitigated  by  actions  that  DOC  can  undertake  to  simplify  and  limit
the application of deemed export rules.

Our  report,  ‘‘Beyond  Fortress  America,’’  recommends  maintaining  the  ‘‘Funda-
mental  Research  Exemption  (FRE)’’  which  has  permitted  universities  to  operate
with  relative  freedom,  and  ‘‘ensur[ing]  that  it  is  properly  implemented.’’  As  I  noted
in my testimony, that last phrase is essential. There is a natural tendency for indi-
vidual  contracting  officers  to  always  take  the  most  conservative  interpretation  of
any situation and to find reasons why the FRE should NOT apply, rather than the

other  way  around.  An  example  is  the  continual  struggle  that  all  universities  have
had  with  funding  agencies,  particularly  those  in  the  Department  of  Defense  and
NASA,  to  apply  ‘‘inappropriate  contract  clauses’’  to  research  activities  that  do  not
contain  any  classified  components.  This  practice  has  been  described  in  several  re-
ports  of  the  American  Association  of  Universities  and  the  Council  on  Government
Relations.  In  my  personal  opinion  proper  implementation  of  the  FRE  will  require
each  cognizant  agency  to  issue  appropriate  direction  to  all  contracting  officers,  and
establish  a  process  of  review  and,  if  necessary,  appeal  of  their  actions.  In  this  re-
gard, the letter issued last June by the Undersecretary of Defense (AT&L), Mr. John
Young, appears to be a positive step.
Q3. Satellites  are  directed  by  law  to  be  regulated  as  exports  under  the  ITAR.  What
particular  challenges  does  this  designation  of  satellites  as  defense  articles  have
for  conducting  fundamental  space  research?  What  would  you  recommend  be
done to mitigate those challenges?

A3. Our  report  did  not  focus  on  this  issue,  although  it  certainly  constitutes  one  of
the  significant  areas  of  concern  for  research  universities.  Some  of  the  points  in  the
previous  answer  also  apply  here,  so  I  will  not  repeat  them  (see  the  referenced  Na-
tional  Academies  workshop  report).  A  major  concern  for  universities  has  been
ITAR’s  overly  broad  categorization  of  virtually  all  spacecraft  systems,  associated
equipment  and  data  as  subject  to  control,  regardless  of  their  actual  military  utility
or  their  widespread  availability  outside  the  U.S.  This  is  particularly  problematic
when, as is usually the case, universities must work together with industry in order
to accommodate a space science instrument on a research satellite. Even the dimen-
sion  of  the  screws  used  to  attach  a  piece  of  hardware  will  generally  be  marked
‘‘ITAR  Controlled.’’  Fundamental  science  data  is  also  affected,  as  I  noted  in  the  ex-
ample in my testimony of the 18 months it took a French graduate student to gain
access to data about Mars.

Our  report’s  recommendation  regarding  the  Fundamental  Research  Exclusion,  if
properly implemented, could mitigate some of the negative effects of ITAR on space
research. In the future, a more systematic approach to addressing this matter could
be undertaken by Congress and the Department of State.

One personal suggestion would be for the Department of State to provide a ‘‘carve-
out’’  for  scientific  instruments  developed  in  an  open  university  setting,  and  which
extends  to  the  necessary  interface  information  required  to  accommodate  such  sci-
entific instruments on a spacecraft. I understand that the Department’s Directorate
of  Defense  Trade  Controls  is  indeed  considering  new  definitions  that  might  accom-
plish  such  a  carve-out.  DTC’s  Defense  Trade  Advisory  Committee  has  been  tasked
to undertake a review of ITAR definitions.

Questions submitted by Representative Gabrielle Giffords
Q1. Your  prepared  statement  as  well  as  various  reports  and  materials  note  that  ex-
port controls may be hurting or preventing the U.S. from participating in inter-
national collaborations on space research and encouraging other nations to seek
partnerships  that  do  not  include  the  U.S.  Could  you  give  us  some  examples  of
how  export  controls  have  affected  existing  or  potential  space  research  collabora-
tions?
a. If  universities,  companies  or  other  institutions  lose  opportunities  for  inter-
national  space  activities,  are  not  invited  to  participate,  or  opt  out  of  collabo-
rative projects, what are the broad consequences?

b. Are there any national security impacts?

A1. Please  see  answer  #1  to  the  questions  posed  by  Chairman  Gordon,  which  I  be-
lieve  addresses  the  first  part  of  this  question.  As  to  the  consequences,  the  most  ex-
treme  result  is  the  exclusion  of  U.S.  researchers  from  forefront  research  areas  that
are instead advanced by other, international partners. The U.S. has long attempted
to retain a position of significant leadership across the spectrum of the sciences and
engineering.  As  a  result  of  globalization,  as  our  report  states,  we  may  no  longer  be
the  sole  leader  in  some  fields,  but  our  economic,  social  and  political  strength  re-
quires us to at least maintain our position at the forefront along with a small num-
ber of other advanced nations. Keeping that place is by no means easy nor is it as-
sured. To voluntarily cede that place in return for no apparent gain, as we are doing
by  overly  strict  application  of  export  controls,  is  unwise  and  counterproductive.  Be-
cause the technical information involved does not deal explicitly with national secu-
rity  information,  I  believe  that  our  security  will  actually  be  improved  by  following
the recommendations of our report.

Q2. How might qualified U.S. scientists go about vouching for the credentials of for-
eign scientists seeking visas, as recommended in the National Academies report?
Is  it  sufficient  for  any  U.S.  university  professor  to  send  a  letter  to  the  appro-
priate consulate on behalf of an applicant?
a. Does  it  make  sense  to  set  up  a  more  formal  process  through  a  single  credible
institution  such  as  the  National  Academies  or  some  other  entity?  Was  the
panel  able  to  explore  possible  mechanisms  for  implementing  this  rec-
ommendation?

A2. Our  panel  chose  not  make  a  more  detailed  recommendation  about  about  how
best  to  implement  the  proposed  vouching  for  foreign  scientists.  We  believe  that  the
implementation  details  should  be  defined  jointly  by  the  appropriate  government
agencies  working  together  with  scientific  representatives.  Those  representatives
could well be organized through the National Academies, as you suggest, as well as
several other national professional scientific associations and societies.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. What  would  be  the  best  approach  to  conduct  the  first  round  of  ‘sunset’  reviews
for  items  currently  on  export  control  lists?  Presumably,  it  would  be  a  massive
undertaking. Who should populate such a review committee?

A1. Our  panel  did  not  attempt  to  specify  a  mechanism  for  carrying  out  such  a  re-
view,  but  I  note  that  the  Emerging  Technology  and  Research  Advisory  Committee
(ETRAC) recently established by the Department of Commerce is currently working
to define a methodology that may well be relevant to reviewing the Commerce Con-
trol  List  and  possibly  also  sections  of  the  Munitions  Control  List.  It  is  important
that  any  review  committee  include  appropriate  technical  expertise  and  representa-
tives  from  several  stakeholders,  including  universities.  It  would  also  be  important
that  the  charge  to  such  a  committee  reflect  the  concept  of  a  ‘‘culture  of  openness
and  engagement,’’  as  articulated  in  our  report,  rather  than  the  ‘‘culture  of  contain-
ment’’ represented by our current export control regime.
Q2. Since imposition of export controls decades ago, is there a public record of opin-
ions  on  licenses  that  would  give  industry  and  academia  roadmaps  about  what
is  acceptable,  and  what  isn’t?  How  transparent  and  consistent  is  the  licensing
process?  To  what  degree  can  applicants  cite  previous  license  approvals  to  gain
quick consideration of similar, pending applications?

A2. With  all  respect,  I  believe  that  these  questions  should  really  be  answered  by
the  appropriate  offices  in  the  Departments  of  Commerce  and  State.  Both  agencies
have indeed made attempts to reach out to their constituencies in order to facilitate
the  licensing  process.  And  both  have  attempted  to  shorten  the  time  for  review  and
approval  of  licenses.  However,  the  primary  problem  for  universities  is  Deemed  Ex-
port.  If  licenses  were  routinely  required  even  for  so-called  ‘‘use  technology,’’  thou-
sands of licenses would be needed to accommodate the large number of international
students and the thousands of pieces of equipment on the campuses of our research
universities.  The  administrative  burden  on  both  the  universities  and  the  federal
agencies would be substantial, with little or no gain in national security.

Questions submitted by Representative Pete Olson
Q1. What are examples of capabilities in satellite and launch systems where the U.S.

excels and should hold tight to the underlying technologies?

A1. I do not feel qualified to identify specific capabilities, but feel confident that an
appropriately  composed  panel  of  industry,  academic  and  government  experts  would
be able to do so.
Q2. In  statements  presented  during  the  hearing,  several  witnesses  cited  difficulties
engaging  in  collaborative  space  research  missions,  given  that  all  U.S.  satellites
are  controlled  by  the  State  Department’s  munitions  list.  Yet  the  State  Depart-
ment  claims  they  have  streamlined  the  licensing  process.  From  your  vantage
point,  has  the  Department  made  real  improvements,  or  is  the  system  still
weighed down with too many uncertainties, making future science collaborations
a difficult proposition?

A2. I  do  believe  that  the  State  Department,  like  the  Commerce  Department,  has
made good faith efforts to streamline the licensing process. However, there are still
many  stories  of  excessive  delays  (such  as  the  one  I  mentioned  in  my  testimony,  in

which it took 18 months for a graduate student to get permission to download Mars
data). Furthermore, while expedited licensing might make sense for the physical ex-
port of a piece of hardware, it is generally not practical for the implied ‘‘deemed ex-
port’’ or ‘‘defense service’’ associated with the transfer of technical information. The
major difficulty is that scientific research is normally conducted in an open environ-
ment with a diverse population of students, visiting scientists, and often with inter-
national  collaborators.  It  is  simply  impractical  to  obtain  large  numbers  of  licenses
nor  is  it  even  known  which  license  might  be  needed  at  which  time.  Finally,  one
might  ask  why  we  should  go  through  such  a  licensing  process  in  the  first  place  if
the  technology  in  question  is,  in  fact,  of  no  national  security  importance  or  widely
available outside the U.S.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Major General Robert S. Dickman, Executive Director, American Insti-

tute of Aeronautics and Astronautics

Questions submitted by Chair Bart Gordon
Q1. Dr.  Canizares’  testimony  suggests  that  some  of  the  actions  our  committee  could
take  to  address  the  impacts  of  export  controls  include  1)  endorsing  the  rec-
ommendations  in  the  National  Academies  report  and  2)  requiring  that  each
agency  under  our  jurisdiction  develop  and  implement  a  plan  to  execute  the  rec-
ommendations  and  report  to  Congress  on  their  progress.  Do  you  agree  with  Dr.
Canizares’ suggestions? Are there other actions this committee could take, within
its  jurisdiction,  to  address  the  impacts  of  export  controls  on  science  and  tech-
nology competitiveness and to ensure America’s leadership in space?

A1. I  believe  Dr.  Canizares  is  correct  to  endorse  the  recommendations  of  the  ‘‘For-
tress America’’ report. These recommendations are designed to provide more consist-
ency  to  the  regimen,  account  for  changes  in  the  marketplace,  encourage  ingenuity,
and  ensure  strategic  competitiveness.  I  also  agree  that  Congress  should  place  ac-
countability  on  federal  agencies  that  impact,  and  that  are  impacted  by  export  con-
trol  policies.  This  is  necessary  to  gauge  the  effectiveness  of  any  changes  in  policy
and  evaluate  whether  agencies  are  implementing  the  kinds  of  changes  Congress
may call for. It may also help to indicate when and where future changes are need-
ed.

There  are  other  areas  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  House  Science  Committee
where actions can be taken to address the impacts of export controls. With its over-
sight  responsibilities  over  federal  scientific  research,  development,  and  demonstra-
tion,  there  are  opportunities  to  examine,  adjust  and  affect  policies  that  restrict  col-
laborative  research  and  access  to  research.  As  I  mentioned  in  my  testimony  before
the Committee, I believe the House Science Committee possesses the jurisdiction to
encourage  global  engagement  in  science  and  technology.  We  need  to  invest  in  our
research & test facilities to ensure that we maintain the state-of-the-art in capabili-
ties  in  those  areas.  If  visa  policies  are  indeed  changed  to  provide  more  access  for
foreign  scientist  and  students,  we  must  make  certain  that  we  have  the  infrastruc-
ture  and  programs  in  place  that  capture  their  passions  and  imaginations  once  they
are here so as to increase our available talent pool at the expense of the talent pool
foreign competitors have to draw from.

I  certainly  would  not  want  to  see  the  Committee  limited  to  these  suggestions.  I
believe  that  as  new  policies  are  put  in  place,  more  obvious  opportunities  will  also
present themselves for the Committee to examine and enact. The first step is taking
the  first  step,  and  I  believe  that  the  Committee  has  already  committed  to  that
through  its  efforts  to  examine  where  improvements  can  be  made  in  the  current  ex-
port control regimens.
Q2. Your  testimony  states  that  ‘‘We  need  to  make  certain  that  we  develop  and  im-
plement  integrated  policies  and  holistic  strategies  that  enable  us  to  remain
technologically  superior  to  threats  against  our  national  security,  embrace  par-
ticipation  in  the  international  science  community,  and  regain  competitiveness
in  the  global  marketplace.’’  That  sounds  like  a  pretty  challenging  task.  How  in
practical  terms  should  we  go  about  doing  that?  What  entity  should  be  involved
in  leading  the  development  and  implementation  of  an  integrated  policy  and
strategy?

A2. While  the  challenge  is  not  insignificant,  it  simply  proposes  is  that  we  regain
a  position  we  held  for  many  decades—that  we  do  the  things  that  got  us  there  in
the first place. The process should begin with defining core principles that serve as
a foundation for policies and programs that are developed. Whether in government,
academia, or industry, it is a common business practice to define a core mission and
goals  and  then  develop  a  strategic  plan  around  those  defining  principles.  Over  the
course of time, it is necessary to step back and evaluate what you are doing strategi-
cally,  moving  towards  evolving  opportunities,  and  retiring  outdated  pursuits.  The
key is having that core mission and associated values to act as an axis for the stra-
tegic plan and its subsequent evolutions to revolve around.

I  believe  that  this  needs  to  take  place  at  a  sufficiently  high  level  so  as  to  have
the  authority  to  provide  coordination  and  cohesion  among  the  many  departments,
agencies  and  offices  involved.  The  National  Security  Council  (NSC)  comes  to  mind
because of the level of the office and its ability to coordinate policies and initiatives
through the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of the United States

Trade  Representative,  and  the  President’s  Intelligence  Advisory  Board  and  Intel-
ligence Oversight Board.

Of course, policies have little practical effect without the support of implementing

authorization and appropriation.
Q3. What  specifically  does  the  AIAA  recommend  for  addressing  concerns  about  the
impact  of  export  controls  on  the  commercial  sale  and  use  of  satellites  for  re-
search purposes?

A3. As I elaborated upon in my testimony before the Committee, I believe we need
to take on the task of evaluating why we are protecting capabilities, and then exam-
ine those capabilities that are currently restricted to ensure that we are not building
the fence higher than is necessary to protect national security at the expense of the
innovation and industrial base we are depending on to provide those national secu-
rity capabilities. I think it is important that our national security goals should also
ensure a robust and sustainable aerospace sciences, technology and industrial base.
Once  that  bar  has  been  set,  the  same  constraints  should  apply  to  specific  compo-
nents  of  research  satellites  as  are  applicable  to  commercial  service  satellites  (e.g.,
communications satellites). Once the components are in foreign hands, there is real-
ly no further control regarding their application.
Q4. You  testified  that  the  AIAA  is  undertaking  an  independent  effort  to  create  a
process  for  evaluating  the  list  of  controlled  satellite  components  on  a  regular
basis.  Could  you  please  elaborate  on  the  process  you  envision  creating?  What  is
the  timetable  for  AIAA  to  complete  its  work?  Who  should  conduct  those  regular
evaluations?

A4. AIAA  has  a  cataloguing  effort  underway  that  is  analyzing  components  of  the
communications  satellite.  What  we  are  currently  examining  is  just  a  start  of  what
is  necessary,  and  it  will  have  its  limitations.  To  begin  with,  we  understand  that
Congress  will  need  to  provide  authority  to  someone  within  the  executive  branch  to
make  determinations  on  how  to  use  the  findings  of  an  examination  such  as  what
belongs  on  which  list,  and  to  what  degree  a  component  should  be  subjected  to  re-
strictions.  We  also  are  working  with  unclassified  data.  Certainly  there  are  going  to
be  directorates  and  offices  within  our  national  security  agencies  that  have  control
of  data  that  is  not  and  should  not  be  publicly  available.  That  can  include  anything
from  alloy  characteristics  and  structural  traits  to  capabilities  and  manufacturing
technologies  that  would  give  a  domestic  component  a  national  security-designated
advantage.

For  our  purposes,  we  started  with  just  the  satellite  bus,  and  broke  it  down  by
component.  We  then  worked  throughout  our  membership  to  identify  appropriate
subject  matter  experts  (SMEs)  who  could  examine  those  components  in  a  compari-
son  with  commercially  available  foreign  designed  and  manufactured  components.
We  use  a  series  of  criteria  that  include  metric  for  performance,  analyze  the  range
of U.S. suppliers, compare against the best non-U.S. component, and make a deter-
mination  of  whether  or  not  a  competitive  advantage  exist  for  the  U.S.  component.
Finally,  we  analyze  whether  there  is  a  discriminating  value  between  military  and
non-military  applications.  Once  an  SME  has  completed,  documented  and  submitted
a  survey,  it  is  then  subjected  to  a  peer  review  process  that  evaluates  both  the  con-
clusion of the survey, and the process and support provided by the SME in making
these determinations.

Our  timeline  for  this  process  is  to  complete  this  initial  examination  and  have  a
compilation of surveys completed by early summer. This will not be a formal report,
and is only intended to provide supporting data for a much larger process.

I  would  suggest  that  the  cataloguing  process  and  the  determinations  on  which
control  list  components  should  be  placed  should  reside  somewhere  within  the  na-
tional security community where there is access to current classified data on compo-
nents,  capabilities  and  uses,  both  domestic  and  foreign.  That  office  must  consist  of
a highly-technical, highly-competent workforce, and the staff should be rotated regu-
larly  to  maintain  an  appropriate  mix  of  individuals  from  government,  industry  and
academia who have a strong familiarity with current research, technology and capa-
bilities in this area. The review committee should include relevant discipline experts
from a number of different organizational entities to provide a balanced perspective
and  should  include  at  least  the  Department  of  Defense,  NASA,  the  National  Secu-
rity  Agency,  the  Department  of  Commerce,  the  National  Security  Space  Office
(NSSO),  National  Reconnaissance  Office  (NRO),  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  Na-
tional  Intelligence  (ODNI),  and  some  recognized  non-governmental  organizations
with resident experts on applicable technologies.

Q5. In  your  prepared  statement,  you  recommend  that  ‘‘we  need  to  evaluate  the
trends  in  capabilities  of  foreign  components  . . .  examine  how  far  equivalent
components’  capabilities  have  come  and  project  when  we  may  expect  those  ca-
pabilities  to  surpass  U.S.  components  to  inform  periodic  reevaluation  of  tech-
nologies.’’  Could  you  please  discuss  this  evaluation  process?  Is  the  data  on  for-
eign component capabilities available to allow an evaluation of foreign capabili-
ties?  Who  should  have  responsibility  for  regular  evaluations  of  foreign  capabili-
ties?

A5. Once  a  systematic  evaluation  survey  process  is  established  with  qualified  and
confirmed  data  and  SMEs  capable  of  executing  those  evaluations  with  sufficient
peer  review,  the  goal  of  this  recommendation  becomes  institutionalized.  As  part  of
that survey, we should be evaluating the progression in foreign capabilities perhaps
building  a  timeline  that  shows  that  progression  that  corresponds  with  the  surveys.
A  ratio  between  the  metric  that  measures  the  capability  with  correlating  timeline
that  competitors  have  achieved  progressing  levels  of  capability  would  illustrate
those  trends.  That  is  much  easier  said  than  done,  but  it  is  not  so  difficult  that  we
cannot complete this initial step in a reasonable timeframe.

After  that  point,  it  is  a  matter  of  continuing  to  invest  resources  and  maintaining
oversight so that this survey office does not develop a culture similar to other parts
of  the  export  control  sector  where  decisions  can  be  arbitrary  and  become  unneces-
sarily  conservative  in  their  approach  to  moving  technologies  and  services  off  the
most rigid control lists, or, conversely, overly aggressive in removing sensitive tech-
nologies  off  those  same  lists.  It  really  becomes  a  balancing  act  at  that  level,  and
the  key  will  be  sufficient  oversight  from  Congress  and  upper  levels  within  the  Ad-
ministration.

I  would  refer  to  my  response  for  Question  4  on  much  of  this.  I  believe  that  the
U.S.  national  security  community  has  and  does  collect  much  of  this  data,  however,
I  am  not  able  to  venture  a  guess  on  whether  a  centralized  clearinghouse  for  this
type  of  highly  sensitive  classified  information  exists,  or  whether  it  would  involve
several individual collections of data housed among several agencies and offices. For
the sake of consistency in the process, the same individuals charged with examining
the U.S. capabilities should probably examine those foreign capabilities and progres-
sion trends.

Questions submitted by Representative Gabrielle Giffords
Q1. The CSIS study on export controls noted concerns regarding the negative impact
of  export  controls  on  selected  areas  of  the  space  supplier  base  such  as  solar  cell
and  solar  cell  substrate  technologies.  These  would  appear  to  be  space  tech-
nologies for civil applications. From your AIAA perspective, are you aware of any
implications  of  export  controls  on  our  ability  to  achieve  the  Nation’s  objectives
to invest in ‘‘green technologies’’ and renewable energy capabilities?

A1. Excluding  nuclear  power  sources  and  perhaps  state-of-the-art  high  efficiency,
space-qualified  solar  cells,  I  know  of  no  reason  why  satellite  power  system  tech-
nologies  should  be  sufficiently  sensitive  from  a  national  security  perspective  to  be
on  the  ITAR  list.  To  the  extent  that  these  technologies  can  contribute  to  cost-effec-
tive  means  for  supplying  renewable  energy,  it  is  in  the  national  interest  to  assure
they get maximum use. Achieving the maximum potential to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions  globally  using  space-derived  renewable  energy  technologies  can  only  be
realized  with  minimum  restriction  on  their  export.  Applying  the  ITAR  regimen  to
these technologies will inhibit realization of that objective.

An  example  of  the  effects  of  export  controls  have  had  in  limiting  the  ability  of
technology,  though  not  a  green  technology,  would  be  Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging
(MRI)  medical  equipment.  While  this  technology  has  shown  great  benefit  to  the
medical  community,  it  was  slow  to  gain  exclusion  from  export  controls  because  of
its advanced technology systems that were subject to those controls. It is a medical
technology that has improved the human condition worldwide. However, it has only
become  widely  available  after  an  exclusion  was  included  in  Category  3  of  the  Com-
mercial Control list.

As has long been the case with aerospace and aerospace systems technologies, we
are bound to discover civil and commercial ‘‘green technology’’ uses well beyond the
original  design  intent  through  technology  transfers  as  we  look  to  reduce  our  con-
sumption of carbon-based fuels. In that process, it should be expected that there will
be  export  control  obstacles.  The  hope  is  that  as  innovation  progresses,  we  will  be
able to overcome many of those hurdles and bring those technologies to bear in our
efforts to reduce our carbon footprint.

Q2. Stories have appeared in the foreign press regarding the possible repatriation of
foreign-born  scientist  and  engineers  being  lured  by  the  promise  of  expanding
space programs in their native countries. From your position in AIAA, what does
this  mean  for  the  workforce  of  agencies  such  as  NASA  and  for  the  U.S.  aero-
space industry? What types of incentives do foreign scientists and engineers edu-
cated  or  working  in  the  U.S.  have  for  staying  in  the  U.S.  as  opposed  to  taking
their talent and experience overseas?

A2. The  U.S.  remains  the  leader  in  many  science,  technology  and  engineering  re-
search  disciplines.  In  many  instances,  there  remains  considerable  esteem  for  being
a  part  of  U.S.  research  and  development,  in  U.S.  innovation.  About  15  percent  of
the  membership  of  AIAA  is  made  up  of  foreign  aerospace  professionals.  There  are
measurable  benefits  that  they  receive  for  that  membership,  but  first  and  foremost
they  come  to  us  for  the  esteem  of  being  a  part  of  the  American  Institute  of  Aero-
nautics and Astronautics.

For all the faults that ‘experts’ find in U.S. science and technology policy and pro-
grams, we are a stable base for innovation and research. Many foreign scientist and
students  continue  to  come  to  the  U.S.  to  be  apart  of  that.  What  often  gets  lost  in
the  budget  discussions  is  that,  while  the  percentages  of  our  federal  budget  des-
ignated for research and development has waned, we are still investing more in this
area  than  any  other  single  country  in  the  world.  That  investment  goes  a  long  way
in influencing foreign scientist and students to be apart of the U.S. system.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. What  would  be  the  best  approach  to  conduct  the  first  round  of  ‘sunset’  reviews
for  items  currently  on  export  control  lists?  Presumably,  it  would  be  a  massive
undertaking. Who should populate such a review committee?

A1. We must first examine the principles for why we restrict technologies and build
a  sound  strategy  for  examining  and  listing  the  technologies  based  on  those  prin-
ciples. As I’ve previously mentioned, once a systematic evaluation survey process is
established with qualified and confirmed data and SMEs capable of executing those
evaluations with sufficient peer review, the goal of this recommendation becomes in-
stitutionalized.  As  part  of  that  survey,  we  should  be  evaluating  the  progression  in
foreign capabilities, building a timeline that shows the progression that corresponds
with the surveys.

I don’t believe that we should have the same people who evaluate the applications
also  performing  this  technical  analysis  of  the  capabilities  of  technologies  and  serv-
ices. I would suggest that the cataloguing process and the determinations on which
control list components should be place should reside somewhere within the national
security community where there is access to current highly classified data on compo-
nents,  capabilities  and  uses,  both  domestic  and  foreign.  That  office  must  consist  of
a highly-technical, highly-competent workforce, and the staff should be rotated regu-
larly  to  maintain  an  appropriate  mix  of  individuals  from  government.  industry  and
academia  who  have  strong  familiarity  with  current  research,  technology  and  capa-
bilities in this area. The review committee should include relevant discipline experts
from a number of different organizational entities to provide a balanced perspective
and  should  include  at  least  the  Department  of  Defense,  NASA,  the  National  Secu-
rity  Agency,  the  Department  of  Commerce,  the  National  Security  Space  Office
(NSSO),  National  Reconnaissance  Office  (NRO),  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  Na-
tional  Intelligence  (ODNI),  and  some  recognized  non-governmental  organizations
with resident experts on applicable technologies.
Q2. Foreign satellite builders have been openly marketing satellites as being ‘‘ITAR-
free.’’ What has been the record of their marketing efforts? Is there any evidence
that  they  are  taking  away  sales  from  U.S.  builders?  Technologically,  how  do
their satellites compare to ours?

A2. I believe there are six specific cases where the stated determining factor in the
decision  to  use  a  foreign  manufactured  satellite  was  ‘‘ITAR-free’’  marketing.  How-
ever,  the  real  impact  is  being  felt  downstream  in  the  second  and  third  tier  compa-
nies who design, manufacture and sell satellite and launch components and services.
This  is  where  satellite  manufacturers  have  become  very  vocal  about  their  intent  to
seek  ‘‘ITAR-free’’  components,  and  this  is  where  the  U.S.  is  beginning  to  see  a  real
consolidation  and  reduction  in  the  industrial  base.  Our  primes  are  still  delivering
enough hardware to the U.S. Government, that they have been able to sustain mar-
ket share losses in other markets due to ITAR and other export control regulations
up to this point.

Unfortunately,  much  of  the  innovation  that  drives  this  sector  of  the  economy
comes  from  these  second  and  third  tier  companies.  As  these  areas  fade  away,  so
does the culture that is willing to take on risk in their research, design, & develop-
ment,  and  that  is  able  to  adapt  to  changes  and  challenges  in  the  marketplace  at
the fastest pace.

I  believe  that  in  most  instances,  U.S.  satellites  still  lead  the  world  in  design  and
capability.  However,  where  we  are  losing  footing  is  in  the  components  that  make
up  those  satellites.  As  this  happens,  it  is  only  a  matter  of  time  before  we  begin  to
see the playing field in the satellites begin to level.
Q3. Since imposition of export controls decades ago, is there a public record of opin-
ions  on  licenses  that  would  give  industry  and  academia  roadmaps  about  what
is  acceptable,  and  what  isn’t?  How  transparent  and  consistent  is  the  licensing
process?  To  what  degree  can  applicants  cite  previous  license  approvals  to  gain
quick consideration of similar, pending applications?

A3. The roadmap question is an interesting one. In the National Academies report,
Recommendation 1.a states, ‘‘(The President should) Recognize the interdependence
of  national  security  and  economic  competitiveness  factors  in  making  export  control
decisions  with  respect  to  individual  requests  for  licenses  through  a  principle-based
system.’’ Recommendation 1.c continues, ‘‘(The President should) Establish as a new
administrative entity, a coordinating center for export controls, with responsibilities
for  coordinating  all  interfaces  with  persons  or  entities  seeking  export  licenses  and
expediting  agency  processes  with  respect  to  the  granting  or  denial  of  export  li-
censes.’’ Recommendation 1.d concludes, ‘‘ (The President should) Establish an inde-
pendent export license appeals panel to hear and decide disputes about whether ex-
port  licenses  are  required,  whether  particular  decisions  to  grant  or  deny  licenses
were  made  properly,  and  whether  sunset  requirements  have  been  carried  out  prop-
erly.

From the book United States Export Controls, Fifth Edition, which appears in Ap-
pendix F of the ‘‘Fortress America’’ report, Table 1–1 lists the U.S. Government enti-
ties with statutory authority to control exports. This table lists 16 departments and
agencies, under 35 different regulations, many with similar areas of controlling au-
thority. Further, Table 1–3 shows the decision tree for determining agency jurisdic-
tion.  This  table  shows  17  steps,  many  with  several  substeps  to  use  in  determining
whether  an  export  is  subject  to  a  control  regimen,  and,  if  so,  where.  Much  of  the
delay in the application process is a matter of figuring out under just exactly which
jurisdiction a particular product or service falls. These two tables well illustrate the
lack  of  transparency  and  clarity  in  the  current  process.  If  Recommendation  1.c  is
enacted establishing a central clearinghouse, much of this confusion in the front end
of the process would be removed, and businesses could have a single source to seek
information  on  what  controlling  authority  exists  for  a  given  product  or  service,  and
to which their application is filed.

Recommendations 1.a and 1.d both address the question about the citation of pre-
vious applications in the consideration of similar pending applications. Currently, no
standards  or  precedence  exist  that  are  used  in  processing  applications.  Each  new
application is viewed in a vacuum that creates much of the uncertainty of the proc-
ess.  By  creating  a  principled-based  system  that  uses  standards  and  precedence  in
the certification process, we can remove much of the current ambiguity in the proc-
ess,  and  reduce  the  time  spent  in  the  evaluation  of  the  applications.  It  further
streamlines  the  process  for  appeals  with  a  governing  entity  to  hear  those  appeals
using guiding principles to do so.

Questions submitted by Representative Pete Olson
Q1. What are examples of capabilities in satellite and launch systems where the U.S.

excels and should hold tight to the underlying technologies?

A1. The  list  of  what  falls  in  this  category  is  getting  shorter  all  the  time  as  other
nations  independently  make  advances  to  achieve  the  same  technical  prowess  we
have  been  trying  to  protect.  While  probably  not  limited  to  these,  the  following  are
some  specific  areas  where  we  still  selectively  excel  and  may  therefore  want  to  re-
strict export for national security reasons:

• Some  very  specific  features  of  engines  and  fuel  containment  systems  for  the

following:

1. LH2-based propulsion
2. Hypergolic propulsion
3. Solid propellant propulsion

4. Advanced electric and magnetohydrodynamic propulsion

• Precision inertial navigation systems
• Re-entry guidance and control algorithms
• Communication encryption systems
• Advanced data processing, reduction, and compression algorithms
• Advanced observation devices
• Optical wave-front control technologies
• High slew-rate momentum transfer devices

Q2. In  statements  presented  during  the  hearing,  several  witnesses  cited  difficulties
engaging  in  collaborative  space  research  missions,  given  that  all  U.S.  satellites
are  controlled  by  the  State  Department’s  munitions  list.  Yet  the  State  Depart-
ment  claims  they  have  streamlined  the  licensing  process.  From  your  vantage
point,  has  the  Department  made  real  improvements,  or  is  the  system  still
weighed  down  with  too  many  uncertainties,  making  future  sciences  collabora-
tions a difficult proposition?

A2. The  fact  is  that  the  Department  of  State  has  been  able  to  reduce  processing
times and reduce the pending caseload for certification licenses. However, I don’t be-
lieve that they have improved the lot of the applicants. The approval rate for appli-
cations  has  historically  been  relatively  high  assuming  the  correct  application  was
completed  and  filed  to  the  correct  oversight  agency.  However,  under  the  previous
system, applications could sit for months before any review took place. Once the ap-
propriate jurisdiction had been established, it could take several more weeks or pos-
sibly  months  before  an  evaluation  of  the  application  was  completed  and  a  deter-
mination made.

Under  the  new  system,  the  application  processing  times  have  been  greatly  re-
duced,  and  most  reviews  are  completed  in  weeks  or  just  a  few  months.  Now,  how-
ever,  companies  are  reporting  that  most  applications  return  with  qualifying  lan-
guage that place more uncertainty than was experienced under the previous system.
So  while  the  State  Department  has  streamlined  its  processes,  these  caveats  often
place reporting and verification obligations on the companies that they have no abil-
ity to satisfy, and the certification is for naught, leaving the companies in no better
position than they were under the longer waiting periods.
