HEARING CHARTER

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

H.R. 798, Methamphetamine Remediation

Research Act of 2005

THURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2005

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

1. Purpose

On  Thursday,  March  3,  2005,  the  House  Science  Committee  will  hold  a  hearing
on H.R. 798, the Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2005, which would
establish a federal research program and a program to develop voluntary guidelines
to  help  states  clean  up  and  deal  with  the  environmental  consequences  of  meth-
amphetamine laboratories.

Methamphetamine,  also  known  as  ‘‘meth,’’  is  a  highly  additive,  powerful  nervous
system  stimulant.  Meth  abuse  is  a  growing  problem  throughout  the  United  States,
and the availability of meth is particularly hard to control because the drug can be
cheaply  and  easily  manufactured  in  small  clandestine  laboratories,  which  are  lo-
cated  primarily  in  motels,  rental  apartments  and  other  residential  settings.  While
the greatest and most obvious impacts of meth are on those who use the drug, meth
labs may also harm those who come in contact with them, even after a lab is aban-
doned.  The  toxic  brew  involved  in  manufacturing  meth  can  harm  innocent  parties,
including  first  responders  (such  as  firefighters  who  may  become  involved  if  a  lab
catches on fire—a not unusual occurrence because the chemicals used to make meth
are  volatile),  future  inhabitants  of  a  former  lab  site  (because  chemicals  may  con-
taminate  a  site),  and  others  through  the  environment  (because  chemicals  may  be
poured down drains or otherwise enter the environment). According to the National
Alliance  for  Model  State  Drug  Laws,  a  federally-funded,  nonprofit  organization,  en-
vironmental  cleanup  and  remediation  of  residential  meth  labs  is  a  top  issue  for
many  State  and  local  governments.  (Cleanup  refers  to  the  initial  removal  of  visible
chemicals and equipment from a meth lab; remediation refers to dealing with resid-
ual contamination.)

On February 15, 2005, Ranking Member Bart Gordon, Congressman Ken Calvert
and  Chairman  Sherwood  Boehlert  introduced  H.R.  798,  the  Methamphetamine  Re-
mediation  Research  Act  of  2005.  A  summary  of  the  bill  is  included  in  this  charter.

• What  are  the  environmental  and  the  human  health  risks  associated  with
former  methamphetamine  laboratories?  When  is  the  site  of  a  former  meth-
amphetamine  laboratory,  be  it  a  private  home,  an  apartment  or  a  hotel,  con-
sidered ‘‘clean’’?

• What  are  the  obstacles  to  the  effective  cleanup  and  remediation  of  former
methamphetamine  laboratories?  What  policies  or  regulations  currently  guide
the cleanup and remediation of these sites?

• Is there a role for the Federal Government in facilitating the cleanup and re-
mediation of former meth labs? Is that role adequately addressed in H.R. 798?

4. Background

Methamphetamine, also known as ‘‘meth,’’ ‘‘speed,’’ or ‘‘crank,’’ is a powerful stim-
ulant  that  initially  increases  wakefulness  and  physical  activity  but  can  also  induce
symptoms  ranging  from  extreme  nervousness  and  hyperactivity  to  convulsions  and
irreversible  brain  damage.  Chronic  use  increases  drug  tolerance  and  deepens  de-
pendence, requiring users to take higher doses more frequently. This frequently re-
sults in amphetamine psychosis, a condition characterized by extreme paranoia and
bizarre, violent behavior—a key factor in the death of most meth addicts. Since the
1970s,  federal  regulations  have  limited  the  legal  uses  of  meth  to  the  treatment  of
a  handful  of  conditions.  Use  of  meth  without  a  prescription  and  the  manufacture
of meth without appropriate permission is illegal under federal law.

The  current  meth  abuse  problem  originated  in  California  and  the  Southwest,
where organized drug trafficking groups sold the drug. But the problem has spread
considerably,  with  that  spread  facilitated  by  the  proliferation  of  small  labs  that
produce the drug for personal use and local distribution. In 1993, the Drug Enforce-
ment Administration (DEA) estimated a total seizure of 218 meth labs. In 2003, fed-
eral,  State  and  local  law  enforcement  officers  netted  over  10,000  labs  and,  in  2004,
almost  15,000  labs  were  seized.  These  small  labs  account  for  the  majority  of  sei-
zures,  and  they  are  present  in  every  state  in  the  U.S.,  taxing  the  resources  of  local
law enforcement.

Of  the  32  chemicals  that  can  be  used  in  varying  combinations  to  make  or  ‘‘cook’’
meth,  one-third  are  extremely  toxic  and  many  are  also  reactive,  explosive,  flam-
mable,  and  corrosive.  Nearly  one  in  five  labs  is  found  because  of  fire  or  explosion,
injuring  or  killing  the  individuals  involved  as  well  as  the  law  enforcement  or  fire-
fighters  who  respond.  During  use  and  production,  meth  itself  and  other  harmful
chemicals are released into the air and deposited throughout the surrounding area.
Inside, these chemicals collect on countertops and floors, and they are absorbed into
furnishings,  carpets  and  walls.  In  addition,  for  every  pound  of  meth  produced,  ap-
proximately  five  to  six  pounds  of  toxic  byproducts  remain.  This  waste  is  frequently
poured  down  drains  or  spilled  onto  the  ground,  potentially  contaminating  soil,  sur-
face water, groundwater, and septic systems.

Small meth labs can be set up nearly anywhere—fields, woods, cars—but roughly
two-thirds of the labs are found in inhabited houses. A typical lab requires little in
the  way  of  materials,  only  glassware,  hoses,  a  heat  source  and  some  old  coffee  fil-
ters. In addition, the ingredients used to manufacture meth are commercially avail-
able  anywhere  in  the  U.S.  The  main  ingredient,  ephedrine  or  pseudoepherine,  is  a
chemical that is present in many over-the-counter cold and asthma medications, and
the  other  chemicals  are  available  in  gasoline,  rubbing  alcohol,  pool-cleaning  sup-
plies, drain cleaners, fertilizer and matchbooks. Moreover, the process itself requires
almost no technical knowledge, involving nothing more complicated that mixing and
siphoning, and the recipe—as well as step-by-step instructions—is freely and easily
available on the Internet.

The  cleanup  following  the  discovery  of  a  meth  lab  can  be  an  expensive  and  in-
volved  process.  Cleanup  is  generally  responsibility  of  State  and  local  governments.
States and localities have different statutes and regulations relating to the clean-
up  and  remediation  of  meth  labs,  but  generally  cleanup  and  remediation  occur  in
distinct phases. The first phase is the initial cleanup of gross contamination, which
includes  the  removal  of  illicit  laboratory  equipment,  chemicals  and  obviously  con-
taminated  furnishings.  Since  meth  labs  are  crime  scenes,  law  enforcement  is  typi-
cally first to respond, securing evidence and overseeing phase one cleanup activities.
After  a  site  has  been  secured  and  is  no  longer  part  of  a  criminal  investigation,
the second phase of the cleanup begins—the remediation of harder to identify resid-
ual  contamination.  At  this  phase,  property  owners  are  notified  and  responsibility
passes  to  them,  often  with  a  recommendation  to  contact  a  contractor.  There  are  no
national guidelines or regulations on how to clean up a residential meth lab for reoc-
cupation.  States  struggle  to  protect  the  public  and  to  find  an  answer  that  is  prac-
tical  for  property  owners;  their  responses  range  from  doing  almost  nothing  to  com-
plete  demolition.  However,  most  remediation  efforts  involve  one  or  more  of  the  fol-
lowing  measures:  ventilation,  encapsulation  or  sealing  of  interior  surfaces,  removal
of  drywall,  decontamination  of  ventilation  or  wastewater  systems,  and  removal  of
soil or treatment of contaminated groundwater.

Even  where  State  and  local  regulations  or  ordinances  exist,  states  and  localities
usually  do  little  to  enforce  cleanup  rules.  Some  public  health  officials  try  to  force
reluctant  owners  by  threatening  condemnation  of  the  property.  Cleanup  is  expen-
sive;  the  cost  to  remediate  a  1,500  square  foot  rambler  can  range  from  $5,000–
$15,000,  and  most  insurance  companies  exclude  ‘‘contamination’’  and  ‘‘felony  activi-
ties’’  from  coverage  for  private  homes  and  some  commercial  properties.  Individuals
buying or moving into a property that was previously a meth lab may have no way
of  knowing  that  their  new  residence  was  once  a  meth  lab  and  the  attendant  risks.
Seven states have established by statute, regulation or guideline a risk-based de-
contamination  standard  specific  to  meth.1 But  there  is  a  great  deal  of  debate  over
what  standard  is  appropriate.  Should  the  standard  be  based  on  risk  to  human
health  (and,  if  so,  what  level  of  risk  is  appropriate)  or  be  based  on  the  feasibility
of  cleaning  up  a  site,  or  some  mix  of  the  two?  How  should  one  determine  the  risk
associated  with  a  meth  ingredient  that  might  be  around  a  typical  household  for  le-
gitimate purposes? The questions are further complicated by the lack of research on
the  long-term  health  effects  of  former  meth  labs.  Much  of  the  research  that  does
exist  on  meth  ingredients  is  based  on  occupational  exposures  that  occur  when
meth’s  precursor  chemicals  are  used  for  legitimate  industrial  purposes.  Those  uses
are  unlikely  to  produce  the  short-term  exposures  to  high  concentrations  of  these
chemicals  that  can  occur  in  meth  production.  Little  is  also  known  about  the  con-
sequences  of  long-term  exposure  to  the  traces  of  chemicals  that  individuals,  includ-
ing  children,  may  receive  from  living  in  a  former  meth  lab,  although  cases  of  lin-
gering health effects from such exposures have been reported.

Most  states  have  little  to  no  funding  to  conduct  research  on  meth  cleanup.  The
National  Alliance  for  Model  State  Drug  Laws  has  pushed  for  a  federal  program  of
research  to  validate  sample  collection  methods,  identify  primary  and  persistent
chemicals  of  concern,  determine  the  most  effective  remediation  techniques  for  par-
ticular  surfaces  (e.g.,  porous  and  nonporous),  and  help  develop  assessment  and  re-
mediation  guidance  for  states  and  localities  based  on  short-  and  long-term  health
effects.  A  federal  program  could  also  aid  in  the  development  of  field  tests  kits  for
meth and other hazardous chemicals—another pressing need.

1 The  seven  states  with  the  risk-based  decontamination  standard  for  meth  are  Alaska,  Ari-

zona, Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee and Washington.

5. Section-by-Section Description of H.R. 798
Section 1. Short title.

The Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2005

Section 2. Findings.
Section 3. Voluntary Guidelines.

Requires the Assistant Administrator for Research and Development at the Envi-
ronmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA),  in  consultation  with  the  National  Institute  of
Standards  and  Technology  (NIST),  to  establish,  within  one  year,  voluntary  guide-
lines for the remediation of former methamphetamine labs, including guidelines for
preliminary site assessments and the remediation of residual contaminants.

Requires  that,  in  developing  the  guidelines,  the  Assistant  Administrator  consider
relevant standards, guidelines and requirements in federal, State and local laws and
regulations;  the  varying  types  and  locations  of  former  methamphetamine  labs;  and
expected costs.

The voluntary guidelines are to be used to assist State and local governments. Re-
quires  the  Assistant  Administrator  to  work  with  State  and  local  governments  and
other  relevant  non-federal  agencies  and  organizations,  including  through  the  con-
ference  required  by  section  5,  to  promote  and  encourage  the  appropriate  adoption
of the voluntary guidelines.

Requires  the  Assistant  Administrator  to  periodically  update  the  voluntary  guide-
lines,  in  consultation  with  states  and  other  interested  parties,  to  incorporate  re-
search findings and other new knowledge.
Section 4. Research Program.

Requires the Assistant Administrator to establish a research program of research
to support the development and revision of the voluntary guidelines in section 3. Re-
quires research to:

present a significant risk of adverse biological effects,

• identify methamphetamine laboratory-related chemicals of concern,
• assess  the  types  and  levels  of  exposure  to  chemicals  of  concern  that  may
• better address biological effects and minimize adverse human exposures,
• evaluate  the  performance  of  various  methamphetamine  laboratory  cleanup
• support other priorities identified by the Assistant Administrator in consulta-

and remediation techniques, and

tion with states and others.

Section 5. Technology Transfer Conference.

Requires the Assistant Administrator to convene within 90 days of the date of en-
actment,  and  every  third  year  thereafter,  a  conference  of  State  agencies  and  other
individuals  and  organizations  involved  with  the  impacts  of  former  methamphet-
amine  laboratories.  The  conference  should  be  a  forum  for  the  Assistant  Adminis-
trator  to  provide  information  on  the  voluntary  guidelines  and  the  latest  findings  of
the  research  program,  as  well  as  an  opportunity  for  the  non-federal  participants  to
provide  information  on  their  problems,  needs  and  experiences  with  the  voluntary
guidelines.

Requires  the  Assistant  Administrator  within  three  months  of  each  conference  to
submit a report to Congress that summarizes the proceedings of the conference, in-
cluding any recommendations or concern raised and a description of how the Assist-
ant Administrator intends to respond to them. Requires the report to be made wide-
ly available to the general public.
Section 6. Residual Effects Study.

Requires  the  Assistant  Administrator  to  enter  into  an  arrangement  with  the  Na-
tional Academy of Sciences within six months of the date of enactment to study the
status  and  quality  of  research  on  the  residual  effects  of  methamphetamine  labora-
tories.  Requires  the  study  to  identify  research  gaps  and  recommend  an  agenda  for
the  research  program  in  section  4.  Requires  the  study  to  focus  on  the  need  for  re-
search  on  the  impact  of  methamphetamine  laboratories  on  residents  of  buildings
where  labs  are  or  were  located,  with  particular  emphasis  on  the  biological  effects
on children and on first responders.
Section  7.  Methamphetamine  Detection  Research  and  Development  Pro-

gram.

Requires  the  Director  of  NIST,  in  consultation  with  the  Assistant  Administrator,
to  support  a  research  program  to  develop  new  methamphetamine  detection  tech-

7

nologies,  with  emphasis  on  field  test  kits  and  site  detection  and  appropriate  stand-
ard  reference  materials  and  validation  procedures  for  methamphetamine  detection
testing.
Section 8. Savings Clause.

Provides  that  nothing  in  the  Act  shall  be  construed  to  change  the  regulatory  au-

thority of EPA.
Section 9. Authorization of Appropriations.

Authorizes $3 million for each of fiscal years 2006 through 2009 for EPA. Author-

izes $1.5 million for each of fiscal years 2006 through 2009 for NIST.

6. Current Federal Response on Cleanup and Remediation

In  October  2004,  the  White  House  Office  of  National  Drug  Control  Policy
(ONDCP),  in  cooperation  with  the  Drug  Enforcement  Administration,  the  Depart-
ment of Justice Criminal Division’s Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section, and var-
ious  components  of  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services,  released  The
National Synthetic Drugs Action Plan. With respect to the cleanup and remediation
of former meth labs, the plan calls on federal agencies to:

• Ensure  adequate  funding  for  clandestine  laboratory  and  dumpsite  cleanups,
including  funding  for  sufficient  personnel  to  support  laboratory  cleanups  and
hazardous  waste  disposal,  so  that  cleanup  costs  are  not  a  disincentive  to  lab
investigations  or  takedowns.  Federal  officials,  in  collaboration  with  State
agencies, should conduct a needs assessment to identify potential program im-
provements and make recommendations on specific support needed and funds
required; and

• Disseminate and apply the latest guidelines for the cleanup of meth labs and,
where  necessary,  coordinate  environmental  remediation  by  appropriate  enti-
ties. These protocols for the adulteration and destruction of precursor and es-
sential  chemicals,  glassware,  and  meth  waste  should  be  part  of  certification
training.

EPA

EPA can use the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Li-
ability Act (CERCLA), better known as the Superfund, to respond to environmental
and health threats, including those posed by meth labs. However, the human health
and  environmental  threat  posed  by  small  labs  seldom  rises  to  the  necessary  level
to trigger a Superfund cleanup. On the other hand, if a ‘‘superlab’’ produced a large
amount of chemicals that were dumped into a river or onto public grounds, a Super-
fund  response  might  be  triggered.  A  few  former  meth  labs  have  become  Superfund
sites.

In  addition  to  EPA  cleanup  under  Superfund,  the  Agency  provides  training  for
State and local responders, and it offers a wide range of technical and management
courses designed to help responders identify and deal appropriately with hazardous
substances.
Department of Justice: DEA and COPS

DEA  is  more  frequently  involved  in  the  phase  one  cleanup  of  meth  labs  than  is
EPA,  but  the  extent  of  involvement  can  vary  by  state.  Typically,  DEA  is  involved
in  the  initial  cleanup  of  large  ‘‘superlabs’’  because  they  are  often  associated  with
large-scale  drug  trafficking  operations.  To  aid  in  this  effort,  the  DEA  administers
the  Hazardous  Waste  Cleanup  Program,  to  fund  and  contract  for  the  cleanup  of
seized drug labs.

The  DEA  Cleanup  program  is  funded  through  the  Community  Oriented  Policing
Services  (COPS)  program.  The  Hazardous  Waste  Cleanup  Program  received  about
$20  million  in  FY04,  the  last  year  for  which  figures  were  available.  In  addition,  in
FY04 DEA spent about $4 million on additional lab cleanups and almost $2 million
on  grants  to  states  to  purchase  lab  cleanup  equipment.  Finally,  DEA’s  Office  of
Training conducts numerous training sessions to ensure the safe and efficient clean-
up of meth lab hazardous waste.

Chairman BOEHLERT. The Committee will come to order.
I  want  to  welcome  everyone  here  this  morning  for  a  hearing  on
one  of  the  most  disturbing  trends  in  contemporary  culture:  the
growing  abuse  of  methamphetamines,  or  meth,  or  crank,  or  what-
ever you want to call it. By any other name, it is just as foul.

Meth  is  a  particular  menace  because  it  combines  characteristics
that are not usually exhibited by a single drug. Abused drugs tend
either  to  be  cheap,  but  not  so  potent;  or  highly  potent,  but  rel-
atively  expensive.  But  meth  is  a  powerful,  addictive,  and  deadly
drug  that  is  also  inexpensive  to  buy  or  to  make  and  is  readily  ac-
cessible.  Worse  still,  it  destroys  families  and  communities  in  areas
that have been somewhat immune to the worst of the Nation’s pre-
vious drug epidemics. What the crack epidemic was to the Nation’s
cities, the meth epidemic is to our rural areas.

Unfortunately,  I  have  been  able  to  witness  to  this  in  my  own
Congressional  District.  While  New  York  has  not  been  a  center  of
meth abuse, it started in the West Coast and has moved gradually
but  now  rapidly  eastward,  the  problem  is  growing  exponentially.
And  Tioga  County  in  my  Congressional  District  has  seen  more
meth lab busts than any other county in the Empire State. We are
privileged to have with us today Tioga County’s Sheriff, Gary How-
ard,  and  I  know  that  he  will  describe  the  devastation  and  chal-
lenges this is causing and presenting.

There  are  many  aspects  of  the  meth  problem,  and  many  things
that must be done to combat it: strengthening law enforcement, im-
proving  treatment,  and  broadening  education  programs,  to  name
just a few. But there is another insidious aspect of meth, and that
is  its  environmental  effects,  which  can  harm  individuals  who  have
no connection whatsoever with making or using the drug: the inno-
cents.

It is that aspect of the meth problem that falls in our jurisdiction

and that we will focus on today.

The manufacture, or ‘‘cooking’’ of meth uses readily available, but
highly  dangerous  chemicals.  That  toxic  brew  can  spread  its  own
devastation  as  firefighters  are  exposed  to  it,  as  chemicals  are
dumped into the environment and as new people move into the site
of former meth labs. And the labs are not those white coat, Bunsen
burner, test tube types of things that we are usually familiar with
here in the Science Committee. Maybe a motel room or a third floor
apartment or a trailer. Labs are easy to create.

But  we  know  very  little  about  how  much  damage  results  from
this  aspect  of  the  meth  problem  or  about  how  to  clean  up  and  re-
mediate former meth labs. States are struggling with this problem
with little information.

That is why I was pleased to be an original cosponsor on the bill
Mr.  Gordon  and  Mr.  Calvert  have  introduced,  H.R.  798,  which
takes aim at this problem. And let me point out that I congratulate
Mr. Gordon and Mr. Calvert for the bipartisan leadership they are
providing. It is a sensible, targeted bill that we have all worked on
together,  and  I  hope  we  can  report  it  out  of  Committee  later  this
month. We want to put this on a fast track.

The  bill  would  bring  the  resources  and  expertise  of  the  Environ-
mental  Protection  Agency  and  the  National  Institute  of  Standards
and  Technology  to  bear  on  the  environmental  aspects  of  the  meth

problem. States would then have some guidance as they decide how
to protect first responders and how to clean up and remediate meth
labs to protect so many more in the innocent public at large.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  our  witnesses  today,  including  my  fel-
low  New  Yorkers,  and  I  look  forward  to  seeing  this  bill  move  for-
ward rapidly.

I want to yield the remainder of my time to Mr. Calvert, the co-
sponsor  of  H.R.  798.  I  congratulate  him  on  his  leadership  on  this
issue. And then we will go to the prime motivater of this whole en-
deavor, Mr. Gordon, the Ranking Member from Tennessee.

in 

Meth is a particular menace because it combines characteristics that are not usu-
ally  exhibited  by  a  single  drug.  Abused  drugs  tend  either  to  be  cheap,  but  not  so
potent; or highly potent, but relatively expensive. But meth is a powerful, addictive
and deadly drug that is also inexpensive to buy or to make and is readily accessible.
Worse still, it is destroying families and communities in areas that have been some-
what immune to the worst of the Nation’s previous drug epidemics. What the crack
epidemic was to the Nation’s cities, the meth epidemic is to our rural areas.

Unfortunately,  I  have  been  able  to  witness  this  in  my  own  District.  While  New
York  has  not  been  a  center  of  meth  abuse,  the  problem  is  growing  exponentially.
And  Tioga  County  in  my  District  has  seen  more  meth  lab  busts  than  any  other
county  in  the  State.  We  have  Tioga  County’s  Sheriff,  Gary  Howard,  with  us  today,
and I know he will describe the devastation this is causing.

There are many aspects of the meth problem, and many things that must be done
to combat it—strengthening law enforcement, improving treatment, and broadening
education  programs,  to  name  a  few.  But  there  is  another  insidious  aspect  of  meth,
and  that’s  its  environmental  effects,  which  can  harm  individuals  who  have  no  con-
nection whatsoever with making or using the drug.

It’s that aspect of the meth problem that falls in our jurisdiction and that we will

focus on today.

gerous chemicals. That toxic brew can spread its own devastation as firefighters are
exposed  to  it,  as  chemicals  are  dumped  into  the  environment,  as  new  people  move

The bill would bring the resources and expertise of the Environmental Protection
Agency and the National Institute of Standards and Technology to bear on the envi-
ronmental  aspects  of  the  meth  problem.  States  would  then  have  some  guidance  as
they  decide  how  to  protect  first  responders,  and  how  to  clean  up  and  remediate
meth labs.

I look forward to hearing our witnesses today, including my two fellow New York-

ers. And I look forward to seeing this bill move forward rapidly.

I  want  to  yield  the  remainder  of  my  time  to  Mr.  Calvert,  the  co-sponsor  of  H.R.

798. I congratulate him on his leadership on this issue.
Mr. CALVERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And  I  am  certainly  proud  to  join  you  as  an  original  co-sponsor
to  Mr.  Gordon’s  bill,  H.R.  798,  the  Methamphetamine  Remediation
Research Act of 2005.

Mr.  Gordon,  I  certainly  thank  you  for  bringing  this  very  impor-
tant  issue  to  the  Committee’s  attention.  I  know  the  Committee’s

Majority  and  Minority  staffs  have  worked  together  since  last  year
to develop and revise this legislation.

As  Co-Chairman  of  a  100-plus  member  Congressional  Caucus  to
Fight  and  Control  Methamphetamine,  I  know  of  the  growing  meth
problem in this nation and show no deference—I know it shows no
deference  to  District  or  party  lines.  This  is  an  issue  everyone  can
agree is wreaking havoc on our communities across the Nation.

As  mentioned  by  the  Chairman  and  Ranking  Member,  H.R.  798
focuses  its  efforts  on  procedures  and  standards  needed  to  decon-
taminate  a  site  where  methamphetamine  is  found  so  our  commu-
nities  can  more  thoroughly  remediate  these  sites,  which  will  pro-
tect  our  citizens  and  ensure  the  health  of  the  environment.  In  my
area  in  Riverside,  California,  methamphetamine  production  has
reached  epidemic  proportions,  with  many  of  these  labs  having  the
distinction  of  being  labeled  ‘‘super  labs.’’  These  labs  are  capable  of
producing over 10 pounds of finished meth per batch. One such lab
was seized in 2003 operating out of a barn in a rural area in River-
side  County,  producing  over  6,000  pounds  of  finished  product  with
a street value of over $33 million. Over four million pounds of con-
taminated toxic soil had to be removed with heavy equipment, cost-
ing in excess of $226,000. Officials from the California Department
of  Toxic  Substance  Control  has  called  this  the  most  difficult  and
costly methamphetamine lab cleanup in California’s history.

So  as  you  can  see,  this  is  a  distressing  issue  which  our  region,
and  quite  frankly  most  of  America,  is  becoming  all  too  familiar
with.  Our  State  and  local  agencies  need  all  of  the  resources  and
tools  we  can  provide  them  in  their  efforts  to  address  this  problem.
I  am  well  aware  that  much  more  needs  to  be  done  to  win  this
fight against this devastating drug, I am optimistic that this legis-
lation  will  be  a  good  start  in  that  fight  and  will  be  welcomed  by
our communities.

I  certainly  want  to  thank  the  witnesses  for  being  here  today.  I
look  forward  to  hearing  your  testimony.  I  am  sure  you  will  en-
lighten  us  on  the  severity  of  this  current  methamphetamine  reme-
diation  problem  and  hope  you  will  provide  us  with  some  construc-
tive advice and feedback for our legislation.

I  am  surely  proud  of  this  Science  Committee  for  doing  its  part
to  fight  drug  addiction  and  specifically  methamphetamine  and
those  aspects  that  fall  within  our  committee’s  jurisdiction.  And  I
certainly want to thank Bart Gordon for his good work in this leg-
islation, and I want to again thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Calvert follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE KEN CALVERT

Thank you, sir.
Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  proud  to  have  joined  you  as  an  original  sponsor  to  Mr.  Gor-
don’s  bill—H.R.  798,  the  Methamphetamine  Remediation  Research  Act  of  2005.  Mr.
Gordon, I thank you for bringing this very important issue to the Committee’s atten-
tion.  I  know  the  Committee’s  Majority  and  Minority  staffs  have  diligently  worked
together since last year to develop and revise this legislation.

As  a  Co-Chairman  of  100+  member  Congressional  Caucus  to  Fight  and  Control
Methamphetamine,  I  know  the  growing  meth  problem  in  this  nation  shows  no  def-
erence  to  district  or  party-line.  This  is  an  issue  everyone  can  agree  is  wreaking

munities  can  more  thoroughly  remediate  these  sites  which  will  protect  our  citizens
and ensure the health of the environment.

In  my  area  of  Riverside,  California,  methamphetamine  production  has  reached
epidemic proportions with many of these labs having the distinction of being labeled
superlabs—these are labs that are capable of producing over ten pounds of finished
methamphetamine  per  batch.  One  such  lab  which  was  seized  in  2003  operated  out
of  a  barn  in  a  rural  area  of  Riverside  County  and  produced  over  6,000  pounds  of
finished product with a street resale value of over $33 million dollars. Over four mil-
lion  pounds  of  contaminated  toxic  soil  had  to  be  removed  with  heavy  equipment,
costing in excess of $226,000. Officials from the California Department of Toxic Sub-
stance  Control  has  called  this  the  most  difficult  and  costly  methamphetamine  lab
clean up in California’s history.

So  as  you  can  see  this  is  a  distressing  issue  which  my  region,  and  quite  frankly,
most of America is becoming all too familiar with. Our State and local agencies need
all the resources and tools that we can provide them with in their efforts to address
this  problem.  Although  we  are  all  aware  that  much  more  needs  to  be  done  to  win
the fight against this devastating drug, I am optimistic H.R. 789 will be a good start
in that fight and will be welcomed by our communities.

I  thank  the  expert  witnesses  for  being  here  today  and  I  look  forward  to  hearing
your  testimony.  I  trust  you  will  further  enlighten  us  all  on  the  severity  of  the  cur-
rent  methamphetamine  remediation  problem  and  hope  you  will  provide  us  with
some constructive feedback on our legislation.

I am truly proud that the Science Committee is doing its part in the fight against
methamphetamine  by  tackling  those  aspects  that  fall  within  our  committee’s  juris-
diction. And with that I want to thank Mr. Gordon again and thank you Mr. Chair-
man.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Calvert.  And
that is a nice segue into recognizing the Ranking Minority Member
of  the  Committee,  Mr.  Gordon  from  Tennessee,  who  has  provided
leadership  for  the  entire  Committee  and,  indeed,  the  Congress  on
this  very  important  issue  that  is  below  the  radar  screen  for  an
awful lot of people. And we are going to do our level best, as a team
up  here,  Republicans  and  Democrats  alike,  to  educate  our  col-
leagues  in  the  Congress  and  to  get  moving  with  the  appropriate
federal response to the issue.

The Chair recognizes Mr. Gordon.
Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As  usual,  I  concur  with  your  opening  statement,  not  only  your
nice  statements  about  me,  but  the  substance  of  this  issue.  And  I
want to join you in welcoming our witnesses today and Representa-
tive  Ken  Calvert,  thank  you  again  for  your  work  and  your  staff’s
work  in  helping  us  bring  this  H.R.  798,  the  Methamphetamine  Re-
mediation Research Act of 2005, before us.

And  I  am  pleased  that  we  are  getting  started  on  this  early.  I
think  we  will  see  this,  as  was  mentioned,  early  on  in  this  session.
Meth  abuse  is  an  insidious  problem  that  is  spreading  rapidly
across  our  country.  The  meth  epidemic  destroys  families  and  com-
munities,  leaving  in  its  wake  overtaxed  law  enforcement  authori-
ties,  overburdened  child  service  agencies,  and  toxic  dumps  wher-
ever meth is produced.

Last  year,  more  than  17,000  meth  labs  were  seized  nationwide.
In my home State of Tennessee, law enforcement authorities seized
nearly 1,200 labs and more than 700 children were placed in state
custody as a result of meth lab seizures.
Now let me tell you about the children.
The  addiction  to  methamphetamine  is  so  great  that  it  over-
shadows the parental instincts. And so when a meth lab is created
in  a  home,  children  aren’t  shielded  at  all  from  this.  And  so  when
the  law  enforcement  agencies  go  in  and  take  the  parents  away,

14

they  wind  up  also  having  to  take  the  children  to  a  foster  home.
Now that is a $25,000 or so bill sent to the taxpayer, but more than
that,  what  happens  is  that  those  children  have  to  leave  their  toys
and  their  clothes  behind,  because  they  are  so  toxic.  They  are  put
in  something  called  a  bunny  suit,  taken  to  a  hospital  with  an  at-
tempt to try to decontaminate them, but we really don’t know what
the  long-term  effects  are.  Health-wise  we  don’t  know  the  effects,
but  we  certainly  know  having  to  grow  up  in  a  foster  home  is  not
the best situation with these children. So this is something that is
very important.

And  now  I  have  mentioned  some  statistics  in  Tennessee,  but

many other states also face problems of similar size.

In  addition,  meth  continues  to  spread  into  states  where  it  was

once thought not to be a problem.

H.R. 798 is the result of a roundtable held in my District almost
a year ago. Working with local officials and representatives of Ten-
nessee  Technological  University,  we  identified  a  set  of  problems
that  needed  to  be  addressed  aside  from  more  funding  for  law  en-
forcement  and  education  initiatives.  These  problems  included  the
need  for  health-based  guidelines  for  clean  up  of  meth  labs,  im-
proved  field  equipment  to  detect  meth  labs,  studies  on  the  long-
term  health  impacts  on  children  found  in  meth  labs,  and  first  re-
sponders who may be exposed in the line of duty.

These  issues  all  have  a  strong  research  component  and  could  be
addressed by the agencies within the Science Committee’s jurisdic-
tion.

And once again, to put a quick face on this, suppose your parents
bought  a  duplex,  with  the  income  being  a  part  of  their  retirement.
Well, somebody moves into one side of this duplex, sets up a meth
lab.  It  winds  up  being  busted,  and  for  all  practical  purposes,  they
have got a contaminated duplex they can’t rent, sell, or do anything
else  with  because  there  are  really  no  standards  right  now  as  to
what is clean up. And part of what we are going to try to do is set
those  standards  so  that  we  will  know  what  is  going  to  be  cleaned
up,  not  only  for  public  safety,  but  also  that  property  then  can  be
put back to good use.

And for law enforcement agents, right now, if they have to swipe
a  doorknob  or  a  car  or  something  for  evidence,  they  have  to  then
send that in and some days later they get it back. We hope we are
going to be able to establish some equipment that is going to allow
them to do that right there on the spot, which will then give them
the  due  process  to  go  in  and  make  a  bust  right  on  the  spot  there.
So  really  this  bill  is  aimed  at  protecting  innocent  people  whose
lives are endangered by these illegal activities, and I think this will
help us move that process forward.

And again, I thank the Chairman for his help in putting the bill
together  and  for  having  this  hearing  today  and  moving  this  for-
ward.

I  want  to  join  Chairman  Boehlert  in  welcoming  everyone  to  this  morning’s  hear-

vert  and  Chairman  Boehlert  both  recognize  the  challenges  facing  our  local  commu-
nities  caused  by  meth  abuse  and  production.  I  am  pleased  that  we  are  moving  this
bill so early in the 109th Congress.

Meth  abuse  and  production  is  an  insidious  problem  that  is  spreading  rapidly
across  our  country.  The  meth  epidemic  destroys  families  and  communities,  leaving
in its wake overtaxed law enforcement authorities, overburdened child service agen-
cies and toxic dumps wherever meth is produced.

Last  year  more  than  17,000  meth  labs  were  seized  nationwide.  In  my  State  of
Tennessee, law enforcement authorities seized nearly 1,200 labs and more than 700
children were placed in State custody as a result of meth lab seizures and incidents.
While these numbers are staggering, they represent only instances where labs were
discovered.  Some  law  enforcement  officials  estimate  that  only  30  percent  of  meth
labs are ever found.

While  I’ve  mentioned  some  statistics  from  Tennessee,  other  states  face  problems
of  similar  size.  In  addition,  meth  continues  to  spread  into  states  where  it  was  once
thought  not  to  be  a  problem.  With  distributed  small-scale  production  and  because
meth  abuse  primarily  occurs  in  rural  areas,  citizens  often  don’t  realize  there  is  a
problem until it has already sunk its roots deep into their community.

H.R.  798  is  the  result  of  a  roundtable  I  held  in  my  district  almost  a  year  ago.
Working with local officials and representatives of the Tennessee Technological Uni-
versity, we identified a set of problems that needed to be addressed aside from more
funding for law enforcement and education initiatives.

These  problems  included  the  need  for  health-based  guidelines  for  the  cleanup  of
meth  labs,  improved  field  equipment  to  detect  meth  labs,  and  studies  on  the  long-
term  health  impacts  on  children  found  in  meth  labs  and  first  responders  who  may
be exposed in the line of duty.

These  issues  all  have  a  strong  research  component  and  could  be  addressed  by
agencies  within  the  Science  Committee’s  jurisdiction.  H.R.  798  is  the  product  from
working with outside groups and Rep. Calvert and Chairman Boehlert. In addition,
the  National  Alliance  for  Model  State  Drug  Laws  has  been  a  valuable  resource  as
we were developing this bill.

H.R. 798 is not a total solution to the methamphetamine epidemic. Unfortunately,
there  will  always  be  people  who  decide  to  harm  themselves  by  using  and  manufac-
turing dangerous drugs such as methamphetamine. H.R. 798 is aimed at protecting
innocent people whose lives are endangered by these illegal activities.

I want to thank our witnesses for taking time from their busy schedules to appear

before the Committee today.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Mr. Gordon.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good  afternoon.  I  want  to  thank  Chairman  Boehlert,  Ranking  Member  Gordon
and  Representative  Calvert  for  introducing  the  Methamphetamine  Remediation  Re-
search  Act  of  2005  and  for  holding  a  hearing  on  this  legislation.  As  a  cosponsor  of
H.R.  798,  I  strongly  support  the  establishment  of  a  federal  research  program  that
would  develop  voluntary  standards  to  help  states  deal  with  the  harmful  con-
sequences  of  methamphetamine  laboratories.  I  appreciate  the  witnesses  who  came
to  testify  before  our  committee  today  so  Members  can  gain  a  better  understanding
of the methamphetamine problem in the United States and learn how agencies, fed-
eral, State or local, currently respond to residential laboratories, in order to address
unmet research needs.

As  the  use  of  methamphetamines  has  spread  so  has  awareness  of  the  challenges
associated  with  this  addictive  drug.  No  other  narcotic  has  the  wide-array  of  dan-
gers—crime,  social  consequences,  environmental  degradation,  property  damage—
that  comes  with  methamphetamine  use.  I  realize  that  I  am  not  alone  when  I  say
that  my  congressional  district  and  surrounding  communities  have  seen  a  growing
methamphetamine  problem.  It  appears  as  though  daily  articles  are  published  in
newspapers across the country explaining how methamphetamine use is increasing,
and revealing the damaging affects it has on communities.

After  speaking  with  the  law  enforcement  officials  in  the  12th  district  of  Illinois,
I  secured  funding  in  2003  and  2004  for  a  grant  programs  in  Southern  Illinois  to
train  approximately  100  law  enforcement  officers  across  the  region  in  dismantling
and  cleaning  up  meth  labs.  Also,  the  grant  supplies  the  hazardous  material  suits
and equipment that officers need to safely conduct their investigation. As the panel
knows,  cleanup  is  expensive,  and  the  cost  to  remediate  a  1,500  square  foot  lab  can
range  from  $5,000–$15,000.  Unfortunately,  most  states  have  little  or  no  funding  to

conduct  research  on  meth  cleanup,  and  as  a  result,  not  much  is  known  about  the
consequences  of  long-term  exposure  to  the  traces  of  chemicals  that  individuals,  in-
cluding children, may be exposed to living in a former meth lab.

Undeniably,  methamphetamine  production  and  abuse  is  becoming  an  emerging
problem  across  the  country.  The  Federal  Government  has  yet  to  develop  a  strategy
for how to respond to methamphetamine use. Furthermore, states are struggling to
protect  the  public  because  there  are  no  national  guidelines  or  regulations  on  how
to clean up a residential meth lab or reoccupation. Consequently, I am very pleased
this  committee  is  taking  the  first  step  in  holding  a  hearing  on  H.R.  798,  and  look
forward to hearing the testimony of today’s witness panel.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to commend you, Chairman Boehlert, for
calling  this  very  important  hearing  on  this  very  important  issue.  I  also  wish  to
thank Ranking Member Gordon for authoring this needed legislation.

Instances of methamphetamine trafficking and abuse in the United States are on
the  increase.  As  a  result,  this  drug  is  having  a  devastating  impact  on  communities
across the Nation.

Unfortunately,  many  common  household  products  contain  most  of  the  necessary

chemicals to complete the manufacturing process.

Another disastrous side effect of the methamphetamine epidemic is the bad affect
it  is  having  on  the  environment.  Toxic  waste  from  clandestine  drug  labs  in  rural
America  is  being  dumped  on  the  land,  into  streams,  sewage  systems  and  landfills.
For  every  pound  of  meth  produced,  between  one  and  six  pounds  of  highly  toxic
waste  is  generated.  These  chemicals  and  fumes  can  permeate  the  walls,  carpets,
plaster and wood of meth labs, as well as the surrounding soil, are known to cause
cancer,  short-term  and  permanent  brain  damage  and  immune  and  respiratory  sys-
tem  problems.  Of  the  1654  labs  seized  nationwide  in  1998,  nearly  one  in  five  were
found because of fire or explosion.

That  is  why  it  is  so  urgent  that  Congress  takes  immediate  steps  to  combat  meth

production and its dangerous consequences.

I thank the witnesses who have agreed to appear here today to answer questions.

We appreciate your insight on this issue.

[The prepared statement by Mr. Davis follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE LINCOLN DAVIS

Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member.
Just this week, CBS 60 Minutes ran a story about a health crisis that has become
a  major  problem  in  many  rural  areas  of  our  country.  I  would  like  to  thank  the
Chairman,  Ranking  Member,  Members  of  this  committee,  and  other  colleagues  for
bringing this crisis to the forefront of the national health care debate.

The crisis is methamphetamine. My State of Tennessee ranks third in the Nation
in the total number of meth clandestine incidents reported in 2004, according to the
National  Clandestine  Laboratory  Database.  In  fact,  75  percent  of  all  the  meth  lab
seizures in the Southeast are in Tennessee.

More than 1200 meth labs were seized in Tennessee in 2004. In my District alone,
there are eight counties in which 20 or more meth labs each were found. One could
argue that my District is the epicenter of Tennessee’s meth crisis.

Methamphetamine  destroys  families  and  communities.  It’s  cheap,  easy  to  make,
and highly addictive. It is deadly—and has been known to kill people who don’t even
use it.

So  when  we  talk  about  meth,  we  are  not  just  talking  about  one  drug  and  how
it affects the user, we are also talking about the health and well being of those liv-
ing  in  the  same  environment  on  a  daily  basis.  And  more  often  then  not  they  are
children.

Meth is often produced in apartment buildings or other shared housing units. The

chemicals used to make it are extremely toxic and flammable.

Nearly  one  in  five  labs  is  found  because  of  fire  or  explosion.  Then,  when  first  re-
sponders  arrive  at  the  scene  or  workers  come  to  reclaim  the  property,  they  are
poisoned by the toxic chemicals in the air, on countertops, in the furniture, and ev-
erywhere else in the house.

No one has studied the health effects of meth cleanup, and there are no guidelines

on how to even begin cleaning up a meth lab.

I  believe  that  Mr.  Gordon’s  bill,  H.R.  798,  provides  a  solid  foundation  to  help  ad-

dress this issue.

Because  somewhere,  as  we  speak,  methamphetamine  is  cooking.  A  match  will  be

lit. An explosion will occur. A life will be lost.

Time is of the utmost importance, and we need to act now.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.
[The prepared statement by Mr. Carnahan follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSS CARNAHAN

Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member, I want to thank you for introducing this

legislation and hosting this all-important hearing.

I am tremendously sensitive to the problem of methamphetamine or ‘‘meth’’ abuse
due  to  it’s  widespread  emergence  in  my  district.  Last  year  my  home  State  of  Mis-
souri had the unfortunate distinction of being the number one state in the country,
by  more  than  double,  for  methamphetamine  laboratory  seizures.  Furthermore,  Jef-
ferson County, which resides in my congressional district, has the most seizures and
arrests related to ‘‘meth’’ in the State of Missouri. While I am proud of the job that
our  local  law  enforcement  officials  are  doing,  I  am  troubled  by  the  growing  preva-
lence  of  ‘‘meth’’  abuse  in  rural  areas  of  our  country  and  believe  that  the  U.S.  Con-
gress has a responsibility to address the problem.

I  am  an  original  co-sponsor  of  H.R.  798,  the  bill  under  consideration,  as  it  will
aid  our  local  law  enforcement,  environmental  regulatory,  and  health  care  officials
in  coping  with  ‘‘meth’’  abuse  by  providing  voluntary  guidelines  to  clean  up  and  re-
mediate  the  highly  toxic  chemicals  that  are  used  to  make  the  drug.  As  it  stands
now, the harmful effects of contamination are not fully recognized and first respond-
ers,  future  inhabitants,  and  sadly,  children  are  at  risk  of  developing  health  prob-
lems.  I  truly  hope  that  we  can  provide  local  officials  in  Jefferson  County,  Missouri
and  others  across  the  country  the  tools  to  help  them  navigate  the  remediation  of
former methamphetamine laboratories.

I applaud our bipartisan leadership for addressing this growing problem and look

forward to hearing the testimony of the panelists.

(EPA) 

I would like to thank the Science Committee for organizing this hearing regarding
the  Methamphetamine  Remediation  Research  Act  of  2005,  H.R.  798.  I  am  a  proud
co-sponsor  of  this  legislation  and  believe  H.R.  798  will  help  correct  many  of  the
problems  related  to  methamphetamines.  The  Methamphetamine  Remediation  Re-
search  Act  will  implement  a  research  program  at  the  Environmental  Protection
Agency 
cleanup  of
methamphetamines.  This  bill  will  also  call  for  the  National  Academy  of  Science  to
perform  a  study  on  the  long-term  health  effects  on  children  rescued  from  living  in
methamphetamine  lab  homes.  In  addition,  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and
Technology  will  create  a  research  program  to  develop  methamphetamine  detection
equipment emphasizing field testing kits.

to  develop  health-related  guidelines 

The  problems  produced  by  methamphetamines  and 

incidents  related  to
methamphetamines  are  growing  daily.  As  of  February  24,  2005,  the  State  of  Texas
recorded  422  incidences  related  to  methamphetamine  labs  and  as  a  nation  we  had
a  total  of  16,326  incidences.  The  amount  of  methamphetamines  being  used  by  our
young adults is alarming. In 1999, 5.2 percent of 18–25 year olds reported a lifetime
use of methamphetamines. As more of our population uses methamphetamines, the
demand  for  the  drug  rises.  Nowhere  is  it  a  bigger  problem  that  in  the  Midwest,
where methamphetamines account for nearly 90 percent of all drug cases. In states
such as Oklahoma, methamphetamines are surpassing cocaine as the drug of choice.
The State Medical Examiner’s office reports the number of death cases testing posi-
tive for methamphetamines have been higher than cocaine for the past three years.
The  office  also  reports  methamphetamine  is  found  in  more  cases  of  homicides,  and
motor vehicle accidents.

Methamphetamine labs not only damage individuals, they affect our children and
our  environment.  As  the  founder  and  co-chair  of  the  Congressional  Children’s  Cau-
cus, I am saddened by the effects methamphetamine labs have on children. Children
living  at  methamphetamine  labs  are  at  increased  risk  for  severe  neglect  and  phys-
ical  and  sexual  abuse.  Children  raised  in  the  methamphetamine  lab  environment

experience  stress  and  trauma  that  significantly  affect  their  overall  safety  and
health,  including  their  behavior,  emotional,  and  cognitive  functioning.  Hazardous
living conditions and filth are common in methamphetamine lab homes where explo-
sives  and  loaded  guns  are  often  present  and  in  many  incidences,  in  easy-to-reach
locations.  The  safety  and  development  of  our  children  are  negatively  influenced  by
living in methamphetamine lab homes.

Our  environment  suffers  from  methamphetamine  labs  as  well.  In  general,  there
are 5–7 pounds of toxic waste produced for every pound of methamphetamine manu-
factured.  There  are  more  than  30  chemicals  used  to  produce  methamphetamines,
and  most  are  explosive,  caustic  and  carcinogenic.  The  chemicals  are  often  poured
into  streams,  down  drains  or  disposed  of  in  fields,  yards  or  gutters.  Many  highway
clean  up  crews  have  reported  finding  toxic  garbage  from  methamphetamines  in
ditches.  All  of  this  illicit  toxic  waste  eventually  winds  up  in  waterways  via  rain-
water runoff.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Our distinguished panel of witnesses today
consist  of:  Mr.  Scott  Burns,  who  is  Deputy  Director  for  State  and
Local  Affairs,  Office  of  National  Drug  Control  Policy.  He  is  from
the  White  House;  Ms.  Sherry  L.  Green,  Executive  Director,  Na-
tional Alliance for Model State Drug Laws; Dr. John Martyny, Sen-
ior  Industrial  Hygienist,  Division  of  Environmental  and  Occupa-
tional Health Sciences, National Jewish Medical and Research Cen-
ter;  Mr.  Henry  Hamilton,  Assistant  Commissioner,  Public  Protec-
tion,  New  York  State  Department  of  Environmental  Conservation;
Sheriff  Gary  Howard  of  Tioga  County,  New  York.  And  let  me  tell
you,  I  take  personal  pride  in  Sheriff  Howard,  because  I  am  privi-
leged  to  share  a  Congressional  District  that  he  is  a  leader  in.  And
he  has  been  a  leader  in  educating  this  Member  of  Congress  about
this  very  serious  problem.  And  people  so  often  are  a  little  bit  cyn-
ical  about  Congress.  They  think  we  come  down  here,  live  in  isola-
tion,  and  don’t  pay  any  attention  to  anybody  else  and  talk  to  each
other  and  decide  everything  amongst  ourselves.  Not  so.  You  just
heard  Mr.  Gordon  explain  how  he  got  his  education  back  home  in
Tennessee  from  the  people  at  Tennessee  Technological  University.
I  got  my  education  back  in  Tioga  County,  New  York,  and  Sheriff,
I  am  so  very  pleased  to  have  you.  For  those  of  you  in  this  room
who  don’t  know  it,  he  has  had  the  most  busts  in  New  York,  a
small,  rural  county  in  upstate  New  York,  of  any  Sheriff  in  any  ju-
risdiction within that state. And he is a very able professional, and
he exemplifies the best in law enforcement. Sheriff, I thank you for
what you have done for me personally in my education process and
also  for  what  you  do  every  single  day  for  the  people  of  your  juris-
diction. They are fortunate to have you.

And  for  the  purpose  of  introduction,  the  Chair  recognizes  Mr.

Gordon.

Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I am pleased to introduce Dr. Robert Bell, President of Tennessee
Technological  University.  Dr.  Bell  joined  the  Tennessee  Tech  fac-

to know that Dr. Bell served four years on the Board of Examiners
for  the  Malcolm  Baldridge  National  Quality  Award,  and  in  1998,
was recognized by the Secretary of Commerce for outstanding serv-
ice to the Nation as a quality examiner.

Dr. Bell is here today because of Tennessee Tech’s work in fight-

berland  region,  an  area  that  Lincoln  Davis  knows  very  well  and
represents  a  portion  of  that,  and  Lincoln  is  a  graduate  of—a  prior
graduate of Tennessee Tech.

So, Dr. Bell, thank you for your work with Governor Bredesen on
the task force in Tennessee, and thank you for helping us on a na-
tional level.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you so much, Mr. Gordon.
Now  here  is  the  drill.  We  have  got  the  little  clock  in  the  middle
and  we  have  got  red  light,  green  light,  and  caution.  And  Sheriff,
you  will  know,  we  haven’t  changed  the  rules  down  here.  Red  light
means stop, green light means go, and caution means slow up. But
you  will  see  the  red  light  come  on  after  five  minutes.  We  are  not
going  to  be  arbitrary,  because  you  are  expert  witnesses.  We  are
here to learn from you, so don’t get nervous, but when you see the
red light go on, begin to summarize, if you haven’t already done so,
and  that  will  allow  a  lot  more  opportunity  for  the  panel  up  here,
our  colleagues,  to  have  questions,  and  questions  lead  to  answers,
and answers lead to education.

So with that, Mr. Burns, you are first up.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  SCOTT  M.  BURNS,  DEPUTY  DIRECTOR
FOR  STATE  AND  LOCAL  AFFAIRS,  OFFICE  OF  NATIONAL
DRUG CONTROL POLICY
Mr.  BURNS.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Boehlert,  Ranking  Member
Gordon,  Congressman  Calvert,  and  distinguished  Members  of  the
Committee.  I  want  to  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  be-
fore  you  today  to  discuss  efforts  to  reduce  the  problem  of  meth-
amphetamine in America.

And if I may, I would also like to acknowledge my Congressman

The  brunt  of  the  fight  against  methamphetamine  is  felt  by  the
courageous  members  of  law  enforcement,  the  men  and  women
across  this  country,  some  700,000  law  enforcement  officers,  coura-
geous people like Sheriff Howard. The issue is one with which I am
well acquainted, and prior to being nominated and confirmed in my
present position at the White House, I was a prosecutor in a small
town,  a  rural  county,  for  16  years,  and  the  major  problem  that  I

from Utah, Jim Matheson, it is good to see you.

The  Office  of  National  Drug  Control  Policy  just  released,  this
past month, the President’s National Drug Control Strategy, which
builds upon the dramatic successes of the past three years in part-
nership  with  you  in  Congress,  a  17  percent  reduction  of  drug  use
among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders over the past three years. That
equates to about 600,000 fewer young people using drugs in Amer-
ica.  We  have  also  seen  a  25  percent  decrease  in  teenage  meth-
amphetamine use.

Focusing  on  prevention  and  treatment  as  well  as  law  enforce-
ment  and  international  programs,  the  2005  strategy  focuses  on
three  core  priorities:  stopping  drug  use  before  it  starts,  healing
America’s drug users, and disrupting the market. My written testi-
mony discusses a number of programs, regulations, legislation, and
efforts  on  the  national  level  to  discourage  methamphetamine  from
our communities, and I request that it be made part of the record.
I first want to briefly discuss the problem and expand upon what

you have said.

dealt  with  was  methamphetamine.  I  have  worked  closely  with  law
enforcement,  and  I  know  too  well  the  toll  that  methamphetamine
production and use take on individuals and communities.

Fortunately,  there  is  good  news.  We  have  recently  seen  encour-
aging  results  from  new  methods  of  attacking  the  methamphet-
amine  trade.  And  the  Administration’s  National  Synthetic  Drugs
Action Plan is a comprehensive approach.

Let me take a moment and describe the market.
As  many  of  you  know,  there  are  two  main  sources  for  meth-
amphetamine consumed in the United States. Our information sug-
gests  that  most  of  the  methamphetamine  consumed  in  the  United
States  is  likely  to  come  from  super  labs,  labs  that  can  produce  an
excess of 10 pounds in a 24-hour period. They are located primarily
outside  of  our  borders,  although  there  are  some  operating  within.
We  believe  that  a  smaller  amount  is  produced  in  small,  toxic  lab-
oratories, or STLs, which can be found in residences, vehicles, and
makeshift structures, as you know. Attacking the supply from both
sources  is  important,  but  each  requires  a  somewhat  different  ap-
proach.
International efforts.

Law  enforcement  efforts  have  aimed  to  cut  the  supply  of
pseudoephedrine  from  Canadian  producers  to  domestic  super  labs.
The  Administration’s  law  enforcement  efforts  in  this  area  have
been  coordinated  in  Operation  Northern  Star,  a  law  enforcement
initiative led by DEA with participation by the Bureau of Immigra-
tion  and  Customs  Enforcement,  or  ICE,  and  also  the  Royal  Cana-
dian  Mounted  Police,  RCMP.  Since  the  initiative’s  inception  in
2001,  the  number  of  pseudoephedrine  seizures  along  the  Canadian
border  has  reduced  by  92  percent.  That  is  significant.  On  the
southwest  border,  the  Administration  will  continue  to  work  with
our international partners to stop the flow of both pseudoephedrine
and ephedrine into Mexico through multi-lateral cooperation in the
international  chemical  industry  as  well  as  continue  to  work  with
our partners in Mexico to identify and dismantle super labs on that
side of the border.
Domestic efforts.

On  our  side  of  the  border,  the  Organized  Crime  Drug  Enforce-
ment  Task  Force,  or  OCDETF,  as  well  as  the  High-Intensity  Drug
Trafficking  Area,  HIDTA,  provide  a  valuable  means  for  federal,
State,  and  local  law  enforcement  to  collaborate  against  mid-level
and  high-level  methamphetamine  traffickers  in  regions  where
methamphetamine  is  a  significant  threat.  OCDETF  investigations
that  involve  methamphetamine  are  particularly  prevalent  in  three
regions: the west central, the southwest, and the pacific.
State regulation.

The  states  have  responded  to  the  STLs,  or  the  small,  toxic  lab-
oratories, not only through law enforcement, but also by legislative
or  regulatory  means  that  respond  to  the  methamphetamine  threat
that is unique to their individual states. It is different in New York
than in Tennessee. It is different in Utah than it is in Central Val-
ley, California. The measures are varied in nature and incorporate

a host of responses: improved treatment, prevention, and education
measures, local precursor controls, and aggressive law enforcement
efforts.  Over  the  next  several  months,  the  Administration  will
closely analyze the data and results in states where the innovative
measures have been implemented.

And  let  me  close  by  speaking  briefly  about  the  National  Syn-

thetic Drugs Action Plan.

The Administration supports lowering the federal limit on single
sales of pseudoephedrine products and eliminating the blister pack
loophole. That is important. The action plan contains other detailed
recommendations,  including  several  pertaining  to  tighter  regu-
latory controls of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, treatment proto-
cols  and  practice,  education  and  training,  and  investigatory  and
prosecutorial  approaches  to  methamphetamine  cases.  Critical  to
the successful implementation of the action plan’s recommendation
will be a continuing commitment to cooperate not only between fed-
eral  agencies,  but  also  between  the  Executive  and  Legislative
Branches of the Federal Government and a continuing partnership
with state and local entities committed to making the methamphet-
amine  problem  smaller.  I  co-chair  the  National  Synthetic  Action
Plan  Committee.  We  will  deliver  a  report  to  the  Attorney  General
in April, and I look forward to working with each of you when that
is completed.

Thank you again.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF SCOTT M. BURNS

Chairman  Boehlert,  Ranking  Member  Gordon,  and  Members  of  the  Committee:
thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss efforts to reduce
the problem of methamphetamine in America.

The  Office  of  National  Drug  Control  Policy  (ONDCP),  a  component  of  the  Execu-
tive  Office  of  the  President,  was  established  by  the  Anti-Drug  Abuse  Act  of  1988.
ONDCP is the President’s primary source of support for counter-drug policy devel-
opment  and  program  oversight.  The  Office  advises  the  President  on  national  and
international drug control policies and strategies, and works to ensure the effective
coordination of drug programs within the National Drug Control Program agencies.
The  principal  purpose  of  ONDCP  is  to  establish  policies,  priorities,  and  objectives
for the Nation’s drug control program. The goals of the program are to reduce illicit
drug use, manufacturing, and trafficking, drug-related crime and violence, and drug-
related  health  consequences.  To  achieve  these  goals,  the  Director  of  ONDCP  is
charged  with  producing  the  National  Drug  Control  Strategy.  The  Strategy  directs
the  Nation’s  anti-drug  efforts  and  establishes  a  program,  a  budget,  and  guidelines
for cooperation among federal, State, and local entities.

In  my  testimony  I  will  discuss  the  extent  of  the  methamphetamine  problem  in
America,  the  Federal  Government’s  progress  in  reducing  the  number  of  meth-
amphetamine  labs  and  ameliorating  their  impact,  and  the  principal  findings  and
recommendations  of  the  Administration’s  ‘‘National  Synthetic  Drugs  Action  Plan’’
regarding methamphetamine laboratories.

The  issue  of  methamphetamine  is  one  with  which  I  am  well  acquainted.  Prior  to
being nominated and confirmed in my present position, I worked as an elected pros-
ecutor  in  a  rural  county,  where  methamphetamine  use,  sales,  and  production  were
a  problem.  Prosecutors  and  police  in  areas  where  methamphetamine  is  a  problem
know too well the toll that methamphetamine production and use take on both indi-
viduals  and  their  community.  In  short,  the  consequences  to  individual  health  and
the  associated  criminal  activity  as  well  as  the  environmental  and  economic  harm,
can be devastating.

Fortunately, there is good news. We have recently seen some encouraging results
from  new  methods  of  attacking  the  methamphetamine  trade.  And  the  Administra-
tion’s above-referenced ‘‘National Synthetic Drugs Action Plan,’’ which I will discuss
here in more detail, is a comprehensive approach designed to weaken the supply of,
and  the  demand  for,  methamphetamine  in  the  United  States.  I  will  highlight  rel-

evant  parts  of  the  Action  Plan  and  outline  the  tasks  that  we  intend  to  accomplish
over  the  next  four  years  to  continue  to  reduce  the  methamphetamine  problem  in
America, focusing on methamphetamine labs for this hearing.
Describing the Market

Any  supply  reduction  strategy  for  methamphetamine  must  first  inquire  as  to  the
source  of  the  drug.  Available  information  regarding  the  amount  of  methamphet-
amine  seized  from  methamphetamine  laboratories  of  varying  sizes  suggests  that
most  of  the  methamphetamine  consumed  in  the  United  States  is  likely  to  originate
from  ‘‘superlabs’’  (laboratories  with  a  daily  production  capacity  exceeding  10
pounds),  and  either  smuggled  into  the  United  States  from  outside  of  our  borders,
or produced within our borders, often by Mexican criminal organizations.

Similarly,  we  believe  that  a  smaller  amount  is  produced  in  smaller  quantities  at
‘‘small  toxic  laboratories’’  (STLs),  which  can  be  found  in  residences,  vehicles,  and
makeshift  structures.  The  impact  of  STLs  has  been  of  particular  note  on  a  number
of levels. First, children in and around STLs are harmed by the toxic chemicals used
in  the  methamphetamine  manufacturing  process.  Small  toxic  labs  contaminate  the
environment  when  methamphetamine  cooks  dump  their  toxic  chemicals  into  the
water table and onto farmland. Also, these labs create life-threatening hazards, such
as  explosion  or  chemical  toxicity,  which  harms  not  only  the  people  cooking  meth-
amphetamine,  but  first  responders,  who  try  to  save  lives  by  entering  burning  and
contaminated  sites.  As  noted  above,  the  amount  of  methamphetamine  consumed  in
the United States originating from these smaller clandestine laboratories is believed
to  be  smaller  than  that  originating  from  superlabs.  However,  due  to  the  effects  de-
scribed above, they are a particularly pernicious problem.

Attacking  the  supply  from  both  sources—superlabs  and  STLs—is  important,  but

each requires a somewhat different approach.
Administration Efforts

With  respect  to  the  superlabs  described  above,  law  enforcement  efforts  have
aimed  to  cut  off  the  supply  of  pseudoephedrine,  the  principal  ingredient  (or  pre-
cursor),  used  to  produce  methamphetamine.  In  recent  years,  the  supply  came  pri-
marily  via  Canadian  suppliers  to  domestic  superlab  operators.  Law  enforcement  ef-
forts to disrupt the diversion of these chemicals from Canada have been coordinated
in  Operation  Northern  Star,  led  on  the  American  side  by  DEA,  with  participation
by  U.S.  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement,  and  closely  coordinated  with  the
Royal  Canadian  Mounted  Police  (RCMP).  Canada’s  implementation  of  controls  on
the  importation  of  precursor  chemicals  was  also  a  critical  element  in  stopping  the
flow of chemicals into Canada. In a sign that these efforts are having a real impact,
the number of superlab seizures within the United States has substantially declined
since  the  initiative’s  inception  in  2001.  Other  indicators  suggesting  that  Operation
Northern  Star  has  contributed  to  shrinking  the  illicit  pseudoephedrine  market  in-
clude a decline in pseudoephedrine and ephedrine incidents at the Canadian border
by 92 percent and a doubling in the price of bulk pseudoephedrine in the illicit mar-
ket  in  California,  the  state  with  the  most  superlabs.  Arrests  and  prosecutions  are
among  the  principal  drivers  of  these  market  changes:  in  April  2003,  the  DEA  and
RCMP  announced  the  arrest  of  78  individuals  in  10  cities  throughout  the  U.S.  and
Canada, and just last month, the DEA arrested an additional 90 methamphetamine
and ephedrine traffickers in a single operation.

Along  with  the  reduction  in  domestic  superlabs,  it  appears  that  the  decline  in
chemical  trafficking  to  Canada  has  caused  some  chemical  suppliers  to  seek  to  ship
the chemicals to Mexico instead, where law enforcement believes the number of labs
is  increasing.  Consistent  with  these  changes  to  the  illicit  pseudoephedrine  market,
methamphetamine  seizures  at  the  shared  border  with  Mexico  rose  from  1,130  kilo-
grams in 2002 and 1,790 kilograms in 2003 to 2,145 kilograms in 2004.

For  this  reason,  the  Administration  will  continue  to  work  with  our  international
partners  to  stop  the  flow  of  bulk  pseudoephedrine  and  ephedrine  into  Mexico,
through bilateral chemical control cooperation and multilateral cooperation with the
international  chemical  industry.  We  particularly  acknowledge  the  leadership  of  the
Fox  administration  in  seeking  mechanisms  to  control  the  methamphetamine  threat
in Mexico. We fully support their efforts to become more effective at identifying and
dismantling labs on their side of the border. During the week of November 8, 2004,
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, in coordination with DEA, dis-
mantled  a  major  Mexican  smuggling  organization  that  was  smuggling  precursor
chemicals and finished methamphetamine into the United States from Mexico. Dur-
ing  the  course  of  this  Organized  Crime  Drug  Enforcement  Task  Force  (OCDETF)
investigation,  agents  seized  1,100  pounds  of  iodine,  37  gallons  of  hypophosphorous
acid and 25 gallons of hydriodic acid—all of which are precursors used in the meth-

amphetamine  production  process—at  or  shortly  after  crossing  the  border.  The  DEA
Southwest  Laboratory  has  calculated  that  this  quantity  of  chemicals  could  have
been used toward the production of approximately 550 pounds of methamphetamine.
Currently, the United States is involved in several multilateral initiatives to track
chemicals used in the manufacture of amphetamines, methamphetamine, and other
amphetamine-type  stimulants  such  as  3,4  methlyenedioxymethamphetamine
(MDMA) and other synthetics, with the goal of enhancing the involvement of China,
India,  the  Netherlands,  Canada,  Mexico,  Poland,  the  Czech  Republic,  and  other
countries in cooperative chemical control efforts.

In addition, the efforts of federal law enforcement agencies and programs continue
to  be  focused  on  disrupting  the  domestic  market  for  methamphetamine.  The  per-
centage of Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) investigations
in  which  at  least  one  of  the  drugs  involved  included  methamphetamine  increased
from  19.2  percent  in  FY  2001  to  25.1  percent  in  FY  2002.  The  program’s  meth-
amphetamine focus has continued to increase since then, to 25.9 percent in FY 2003
and  26.7  percent  in  FY  2004.  OCDETF  investigations  which  involve  methamphet-
amine  are  particularly  prevalent  in  three  of  the  nine  OCDETF  regions—West-Cen-
tral, where 53.1 percent of the investigations involve methamphetamine; Southwest,
with 58.8 percent; and Pacific, with 45.8 percent.
National Synthetic Drugs Action Plan

In  October  2004,  the  Administration  released  the  first-ever  ‘‘National  Synthetic
Drugs Action Plan,’’ which describes the Federal Government’s response to the pro-
duction,  trafficking  and  abuse  of  synthetic  drugs  like  methamphetamine  and
MDMA,  as  well  as  the  diversion  of  pharmaceutical  products.  Among  the  many  rec-
ommendations  of  the  Action  Plan  are  those  designed  to  cut  off  access  to  meth-
amphetamine producers to precursors such as pseudoephedrine.

Federal  legislation  will  be  necessary  to  implement  many  of  the  recommendations
set forth in the Action Plan. The new Synthetic Drugs Interagency Working Group,
established  by  the  Action  Plan,  will  be  developing  recommendations  to  implement
key provisions of the plan.

Several  provisions  of  the  Action  Plan  aim  to  disrupt  the  ability  of  methamphet-
amine  cooks  to  gather  the  chemicals  they  need  to  produce  the  drug.  Toward  this
end,  the  Administration  supports  lowering  the  federal  limit  on  single-sales  of
pseudoephedrine  products.  The  Action  Plan’s  recommendations  also  include  the  de-
letion  of  the  so-called  ‘‘blister-pack  exemption’’  that  currently  exists  in  federal  law.
Though  the  exemption  was  initially  implemented  based  on  the  expectation  that
methamphetamine  manufacturers  would  not  be  likely  to  undergo  the  relatively  dif-
ficult  process  of  removing  small  amounts  of  pseudoephedrine  from  a  large  number
of blister packs, law enforcement reports that even blister packs are being procured
in large quantities and the emptied packs found at methamphetamine labs. For this
reason,  expecting  blister-pack  sales  to  abide  by  the  same  rules  as  other  pill  con-
tainers  will  help  in  the  fight  against  methamphetamine  production.  Similarly,  en-
suring  that  these  standards  apply  to  the  various  forms  of  the  product  will  prevent
methamphetamine  cooks  from  switching  to  alternate  pseudoephedrine  products,  as
the pills or tablets become more difficult to procure in significant quantities.

As with any regulatory scheme, it is critical that appropriate penalties be imposed
for  violation.  Tough  sanctions  should  be  imposed  upon  not  only  methamphetamine
producers  and  traffickers—both  at  the  State  and  federal  level—but  also  upon  those
who 
traffic  or  distribute  methamphetamine  precursors  such  as
pseudoephedrine. Especially because domestic superlabs have declined, and some of
these  superlabs  appear  to  have  been  pushed  to  areas  outside  of  our  borders,  a  con-
tinuing focus by law enforcement on illicit shipments of bulk pseudoephedrine inside
and outside our borders is critically important.

illicitly 

In  response  to  the  presence  of  these  widespread  smaller  laboratories,  the  Action
Plan  highlights  the  importance  of  improved  treatment,  prevention,  and  education
measures and makes several recommendations for federal action in these areas.

Additional  measures  taken  by  some  states  have  focused  on  limiting  not  only  the
amount  of  pseudoephedrine  products  that  may  be  purchased,  but  also  the  location
and  manner  in  which  the  product  may  be  purchased,  and  have  imposed  additional
requirements  for  the  process  of  the  purchase  itself.  Over  the  next  several  months,
the  Administration  will  be  closely  analyzing  the  data  and  results  in  states  where
these  innovative  measures  have  been  implemented.  As  many  of  these  State  actions
were  taken  in  the  recent  past,  the  Administration  will  wait  for  better  data  and  in-
formation to emerge before commenting on the effectiveness or impact of the various
proposals  to  reduce  methamphetamine  availability  or  methamphetamine  laboratory
numbers and how they relate to federal policy.

Critical  to  the  successful  implementation  of  the  Action  Plan’s  recommendations
will  be  a  continuing  commitment  to  cooperation  not  only  between  federal  agencies,
but  also  between  the  Executive  and  Legislative  branches  of  the  Federal  Govern-
ment, and a continuing partnership with State and local entities committed to mak-
ing  the  methamphetamine  problem  smaller.  We  expect  that  the  work  of  the  Action
Plan’s Interagency Working Group will culminate this year in a final report to cabi-
net-level officials including the ONDCP Director and Attorney General, and possibly
additional legislative recommendations to Congress.
Conclusion

It  is  important  to  remember  that  this  drug  threat,  like  others  we  have  faced  in
the  past,  is  not  impervious  to  effective  supply—and  demand-control,  as  seen  in  Op-
eration Northern Star. We know from years of experience that when we control the
precursor  chemicals  and  reduce  the  availability  of  methamphetamine,  the  price  of
the  drug  will  rise.  By  prosecuting  those  who  steal 
large  quantities  of
pseudoephedrine  from  small  mom-and-pop  stores  and  those  who  would  expose  chil-
dren  to  the  toxic  chemicals  used  to  make  this  drug,  we  disrupt  production.  As  we
make  treatment  available,  and  support  more  people  making  it  into  recovery,  de-
mand  will  diminish.  This  requires  all  levels  of  government,  as  well  as  the  private
sector  and  our  international  allies,  to  commit  to  diminishing  this  threat  to  Ameri-
cans’ health and well-being.

The  Administration  looks  forward  to  working  with  this  committee  and  the  entire
Congress on the important issue of methamphetamine. Together with Congress, we
can  achieve  the  kind  of  progress  that  will  improve  the  lives  of  our  children  and
make us all proud.

BIOGRAPHY FOR SCOTT M. BURNS

Pursuant to his nomination by President George W. Bush, Scott Burns was unani-
mously  confirmed  by  the  United  States  Senate  as  Deputy  Director  for  State  and
Local Affairs in the White House Drug Policy Office in April, 2002.

In  addition  to  his  role  as  principal  advisor  to  ONDCP  Director  John  P.  Walters
regarding  federal,  State  and  local  law  enforcement,  Mr.  Burns  is  also  responsible
for oversight of the $226 million High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) pro-
gram.  Soon  after  his  appointment,  Mr.  Burns  reorganized  the  Office  of  State  and
Local Affairs, and assumed new leadership responsibilities for administration initia-
tives  such  as  reducing  prescription  drug  abuse,  enhancing  drug  courts,  tackling
marijuana and methamphetamine production on public lands, and crafting other na-
tional  strategies  to  disrupt  the  market  for  drugs  such  as  methamphetamine,  mari-
juana,  cocaine  and  heroin.  Most  recently,  Mr.  Burns  was  appointed  by  the  White
House to serve as the United States’ representative to the World Anti-Doping Agen-
cy (WADA), an international organization charged with eliminating doping and drug
use  in  sport.  Mr.  Burns  represents  the  40-nation  Americas  region  on  WADA’s  gov-
erning  Foundation  Board,  and  also  chairs  WADA’s  Ethics  and  Education  Com-
mittee,  which  aims  to  educate  young  athletes  worldwide  on  the  health  and  ethical
dangers of drug use.

Prior to his confirmation, Mr. Burns served as the County Attorney in Iron Coun-
ty,  Utah,  where  he  successfully  prosecuted  over  100  felony  jury  trials,  including
rape, child abuse, narcotics, and capital murder. He also routinely provided pro bono
legal  service  to  the  indigent.  During  his  sixteen  years  as  County  Attorney,  Mr.
Burns served on several state and national boards, including the White House Com-
mittee on Illegal Narcotics and Addiction. In Utah, he instructed peace officers and
others on constitutional law, search and seizure, race relations, and the civil liability
of  peace  officers.  As  an  adjunct  professor  at  Southern  Utah  University,  Mr.  Burns
taught numerous criminal justice courses.

Mr. Burns is a graduate of Southern Utah University and was inducted into that
university’s Sports Hall of Fame in 1996. He received his J.D. from California West-
ern School of Law.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Burns,  and  we

look forward to continuing our working relationship with you.

Ms. Green.

STATEMENT  OF  MS.  SHERRY  L.  GREEN,  EXECUTIVE  DIREC-

TOR, NATIONAL ALLIANCE FOR MODEL STATE DRUG LAWS
Ms.  GREEN.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Boehlert,  Congressman  Gor-
don, Members of the Committee, and staff. I want to thank you for
this  opportunity  for  my  organization  to  actually  testify  today  on
this very important issue.

I  would  like  to  just  briefly  highlight  a  couple  of  points  that  are

in my written testimony.

The National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws is a bipartisan
non-profit  organization,  which  Congress  has  actually  funded  since
1995, specifically to help states create a more comprehensive effec-
tive  system  of  drug  and  alcohol  laws.  We  actually  grew  out  of  the
1993  President’s  Commission  of  Model  State  Drug  Laws  that  Con-
gress created specifically to draft a model code of drug and alcohol
laws.  And  over  the  last  10  years,  we  have  used  our  model  code  of
border-free drug laws and policies to actually help states on a num-
ber  of  particular  drug  problems,  including  methamphetamine  lab-
oratories.  Now  when  I  started  working  with  states  on  this  issue  a
decade ago, I was working with solely western states and primarily
at that time on the issue of controlling access to the chemicals that
are used to manufacture methamphetamine.

But  over  the  last  decade,  as  the  problem  of  methamphetamine
laboratories has actually raced across the country toward the east,
many  State  and  local  officials  have  actually  asked  us  if  we  would
draft  a  model  act  or  model  guidelines  specifically  on  clean  up  and
remediation procedures. Now in preparation for that drafting proc-
ess,  we  have  actually  pulled  together  a  working  group  of  approxi-
mately  20  State  and  local  officials  from  around  the  country,  and
they  are  all  in  different  stages  of  developing  and/or  implementing
clean up and remediation procedures.

We also did quite a thorough search of existing state laws, regu-
lations,  and  guidelines  on  this  particular  issue.  And  there  is  no
question,  when  you  look  at  the  laws,  the  guidelines  and  even  the
policies, that there is a wide spectrum of clean up and remediation
procedures the states have adopted.

Now on one end of the spectrum, you have states that have taken
a  more  minimal  approach.  They  will  recommend  that  the  property
be  aired  out  for  several  days  and  that  the  owner  use  the  proper
and  appropriate  household  cleaning  products  to  clean  the  contami-
nants.

On the other end of the spectrum, you have states that have ex-
traordinarily detailed procedures on preliminary site assessment to
detect  particular  levels  of  contamination,  on  the  decontamination
procedures  themselves,  and  also  on  any  follow-up  testing  that  is
needed to determine whether or not the appropriate levels of clean
up have, in fact, occurred.

Regardless  of  where  on  that  spectrum  of  clean  up  and  remedi-
ation  procedures  that  a  particular  state  might  fall,  the  core  issue
we have discovered really remains the same: how clean is clean for
reoccupation purposes?

Now  there  are  seven  states  at  this  particular  point  in  time  that
have  attempted  to  address  that  issue  through  their  statutes,  their
regulations,  and  their  guidelines.  And  those  particular  states  are
Alaska,  Arizona,  Arkansas,  Colorado,  Minnesota,  Tennessee,  and

26

Washington.  And  Utah  also  has  a  proposed  rule  out  at  this  point
in  time  that  would  also  address  the  issue.  Now  these  particular
states have actually specified a decontamination standard. Now the
decontamination  standard  that  is  commonly  used,  there  are  really
two  types  of  measurements.  It  is  either  0.1  or  0.5  micrograms  per
hundred centimeters squared. Now this particular type of standard
is  actually  a  feasibility-based  decontamination  standard  that  is
based  on  a  cost  comparison.  Basically,  what  it  does  is  it  tends  to
look at how much a state would want to spend to achieve a certain
decontamination  level  with  officials  having  a  perceived  idea  of  the
kind  of  protection  that  level  might  afford  for  adverse  health  con-
sequences.

Most  state  officials,  however,  regardless  of  what  state  we  are
talking  about,  whether  they  have  worked  on  the  issue  for  years  or
are just beginning to work on the issues, would optimally prefer to
use  a  risk-based  or  a  health-based  standard,  a  standard  which
would  help  them  determine  the  level  to  which  they  need  to  clean
to  prevent  the  average  person  from  suffering  adverse  health  con-
sequences. The problem is we really don’t know for sure what that
level is. There is just too little research on the short-term and long-
term  consequences  to  adults  and  to  children  who  are  also  exposed
to methamphetamine as well as other chemicals of concern that are
found in methamphetamine laboratories.

So  in  this  vacuum  of  incomplete  research,  states  are  turning  to
Dr.  Martyny’s  research,  which,  as  we  have  discovered  in  our  own
review  of  laws,  policies,  and  programs,  is  the  leading  research  at
this time on this issue. They also do turn to some of the other stud-
ies, few that they are, that are out there, and they look to the prac-
tices and the lessons that have been learned from states like Wash-
ington  and  Oregon,  which  have  dealt  with  clean  up  and  remedi-
ation issues for many, many years.

Now  in  order  to  help  provide  additional  guidance  to  states,  we
are  actually  pulling  our  working  group  of  State  and  local  officials
together  on  April  27  in  Salt  Lake  City.  What  we  are  going  to  do
is  ask  them  to  help  us  identify  the  particular  procedures  or  ele-
ments  that  should  be  part  of  a  model  act  or  a  model  guideline  at
this point in time, given the little research information that we do
have.  And  what  we  are  going  to  do  is  take  that  input,  and  we  are
going  to  translate  it  into  legislative  or  regulatory  language,  which
will  be  flexible  enough  so  that  we  can  disseminate  it  to  decision-
makers  around  the  country  and  that,  as  the  need  arises,  we  can
easily have it be amended to incorporate advances in research and
technology so that we can always have state-of-the-art information.
I  want  to  thank  you  again  for  allowing  us  the  opportunity  to
share information with you and, of course, at the appropriate time,
I will be more than happy to answer any questions you might have.
Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF SHERRY L. GREEN

Chairman  Boehlert,  Ranking  Member  Gordon,  Members  of  the  Committee,  and
staff, thank you for this opportunity to appear before you today to offer an overview
of  the  work  of  the  National  Alliance  for  Model  State  Drug  Laws  as  it  relates  to
states  efforts  to  address  the  cleanup  and  remediation  of  former  methamphetamine
laboratories.  I  am  honored  to  be  here  to  discuss  these  issues  that  are  among  the

most pressing for states as they address the many problems related to methamphet-
amine.
About the National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws

As  you  may  know,  the  National  Alliance  for  Model  State  Drug  Laws  (NAMSDL)
is  the  successor  of  the  President’s  Commission  on  Model  State  Drug  Laws,  ap-
pointed by President George H.W. Bush. At the conclusion of the Commission’s work
of  crafting  the  44  model  state  drug  laws  addressing  over  70  alcohol  and  other  drug
issues,  the  Commissioners  created  a  501(c)(3)  nonprofit  organization  to  serve  as  an
ongoing,  bipartisan,  independently  operated  resource  to  assist  states  in  assessing
needs, strategizing, and implementing laws and policies to address alcohol and other
drug problems using the model laws as a menu of options. Congress began funding
the  National  Alliance  for  Model  State  Drug  Laws  in  fiscal  year  1995  to  hold  state
model drug laws summits to serve as needs assessment and action planning mecha-
nisms  and  to  provide  technical  assistance  to  states  as  they  implement  summit  rec-
ommendations  including  elements  of  the  models  and  address  emerging  issues  re-
lated to alcohol and other drugs.
Working with States to Address Cleanup and Remediation of Former Meth-

amphetamine Laboratory Sites

Over  a  decade  ago,  the  aforementioned  President’s  Commission  worked  with
states  to  address  problems  related  to  methamphetamine  laboratories.  Since  its  in-
ception,  NAMSDL  has  built  upon  the  work  of  the  Commission  through  its  Summit
process, follow-up work, and technical assistance in their efforts to deal with meth-
amphetamine.  However  over  the  past  two  years  as  the  use  and  production  of  this
drug  has  increased  and  spread  to  states  throughout  the  country,  calls  for
NAMSDL’s  assistance  on  legislative  and  policy  efforts  to  address  meth  and  its  re-
lated problems increased precipitously.

In  response  to  this  high  volume  of  technical  assistance  requests,  NAMSDL  held
the National Methamphetamine Legislative and Policy Conference in St. Paul, Min-
nesota  in  October  2004.  This  event  focused  on  legislative  and  policy  options  toward
creating  effective,  comprehensive,  and  coordinated  responses  to  precursor  chemical
control, drug endangered children (DEC), cleanup and remediation of meth lab sites,
addiction  treatment,  and  related  issues.  Three  hundred  sixty-five  people  from  34
states,  the  District  of  Columbia,  and  two  tribal  nations  participated  in  this  event;
these  individuals  included  law  enforcement  officials,  addiction  treatment  profes-
sionals, child welfare and child protective services workers, elected officials, environ-
mental scientists, industrial hygienists, federal agencies’ staff, and community coali-
tion members.
NAMSDL’s National Working Group on Cleanup and Remediation of Meth-

amphetamine Laboratory Sites

As an additional response to states’ growing concerns and requests for assistance,
NAMSDL agreed to draft a model act or model guidelines for the cleanup and reme-
diation of methamphetamine laboratory sites. Given the growing concern re: cleanup
and  remediation  issues,  variety  of  approaches  among  the  states,  the  increasing
number  of  states  dealing  with  former  meth  lab  sites,  and  the  changing  nature  of
the  labs  (e.g.,  increasing  number  of  apartments,  houses,  trailers,  hotels),  NAMSDL
identified experts working on these issues in a variety of states and convened a na-
tional  working  group  on  cleanup  and  remediation  of  meth  lab  sites.  This  working
group  includes  chemists,  industrial  hygienists,  researchers,  environmental  toxi-
cologists,  public  health  experts,  and  other  state  agency  officials  at  various  levels  of
addressing  these  issues  in  the  states.  Working  group  members  also  represent  a
group  of  states  that  are  both  geographically  diverse  and  at  differing  stages  of  ad-
dressing  issues  related  to  meth;  for  example,  states  that  have  been  working  on
cleanup and remediation issues for many years such as Washington and Oregon as
well as states newer to these issues such as North Carolina are included among the
working group’s membership. Members have met to consider the common issues, re-
curring  questions,  and  research  needed  to  best  set  standards  for  decontamination
of meth lab sites and the resulting legal and policy implications.
Overview of Current States’ Efforts—Legislation, Policy, and Guidelines

Concerns related to the cleanup and remediation of former methamphetamine lab-
oratory  sites  (also  referred  to  as  clandestine  laboratories)  are  frequently  expressed
to  NAMSDL  staff  by  our  contacts  in  the  states  working  to  address  these  issues.  In
preparation  for  the  National  Methamphetamine  Legislative  and  Policy  Conference
and  the  convening  of  our  National  Working  Group  on  Cleanup  and  Remediation  of
Methamphetamine Laboratory Sites, NAMDSL conducted legislative research of ex-

isting  statutes,  regulations,  operating  policies,  and  guidelines  related  to  the  decon-
tamination of these sites.

New statutes, regulations, local ordinances, and guidelines relating to the cleanup
and  remediation  of  methamphetamine  laboratories  continue  to  emerge.  State  and
local governments are working to address different aspects of the indoor and outdoor
environmental  issues  associated  with  clandestine  laboratories.  A  few  states  have
been  dealing  with  the  environmental  contamination  of  these  drug  laboratory  sites
head-on for many years and have significant statutory and regulatory provisions in
place. Others on the federal, State, and local level have more recently begun to ad-
dress these concerns.
Note Regarding NAMSDL’s Research

Please  note  that  our  research  is  ongoing  in  this  arena.  Additionally,  we  under-
stand  that  we  may  not  be  currently  familiar  with  all  of  the  different  categories  of
laws  that  states  may  be  using  for  cleanup  and  remediation  because  of  the  wide
breadth  of  this  issue.  NAMSDL  continues  to  collect  numerous  cleanup  ordinances
from local governments that cannot currently be obtained through our legal research
database.

Additionally,  please  note  that  a  number  of  states  have  put  together  guidelines  or
guidance  documents  for  the  cleanup  and  remediation  of  methamphetamine  labora-
tories.  We  have  defined  certain  documents  as  guidelines  based  on  the  content  pro-
vided  (see  attachments  of  states’  specific  examples).  Documents  we  are  considering
guidelines are those that contain detailed scientific sampling information and reme-
diation standards for methamphetamine. Guidelines do not have the force of law by
themselves but in some instances, for example, local governments have passed ordi-
nances requiring cleanup contractors to abide by the procedures and cleanup stand-
ards  that  the  guidelines  establish.  Some  of  the  more  comprehensive  guidelines  in-
clude  information  on  chemical  toxicity,  laboratory  analytical  methods,  asbestos
guidelines,  and  field  and  sampling  guidelines.  Those  documents  that  may  have  the
term ‘‘guideline’’ in the title but we have considered them as ‘‘guidance documents’’
are  those  that  tend  to  be  less  detailed  in  nature  and  do  not  address  a  remediation
standard for methamphetamine.
Scope of Statutes

Based  on  a  review  of  existing  state  statutes  specifically  relating  to  the  cleanup
and  remediation  of  clandestine  laboratories,  the  application  of  the  cleanup  and  re-
mediation provisions varies from state to state and is determined by the type of sub-
stance  being  illegally  manufactured.  Some  states  only  address  the  manufacture  of
methamphetamine. Other state statutes apply to the manufacture of controlled sub-
stances  generally,  as  they  are  defined  in  the  state  code,  or  more  specifically  to
‘‘schedule I or II controlled substances.’’ In addition to the above listed, some states
also  include  the  manufacturing  of  ecstasy  and  LSD.  Thus,  it  appears  that  some
states  are  focused  specifically  on  the  illegal  manufacture  of  methamphetamine
whereas other states have taken a broader approach in their statutory language.
Use of Contractors for Cleanup and Remediation

Several  state  cleanup  laws  and  regulations  address  the  use  of  a  state-approved
environmental cleanup contractor and/or a certified industrial or environmental hy-
gienist.  Only  three  states,  however,  have  tackled  by  statute  or  regulation  the  con-
tractor  and  employee  training  and  certification  in  detail.  In  Washington,  Oregon,
and  Arizona,  not  only  does  the  contractor  need  to  be  certified,  but  the  employees
and supervisors must all go through a specific training and certification process. Ac-
cording  to  NAMSDL’s  contacts  within  these  states,  stricter  enforcement  is  needed
with  respect  to  the  monitoring  of  contractors  and  ensuring  that  they  are  using  cer-
tified employees and proper remediation and sampling procedures. Part of the proc-
ess  for  monitoring  the  contractors  is  the  requirement  of  some  type  of  work  plan  to
be submitted to the overseeing agency. A few states currently require by statute or
regulation  a  work  plan  to  be  prepared  by  the  contractor.  A  work  plan  may  include
photographs  and/or  drawings  and  a  written  description  of  the  contaminated  prop-
erty,  procedures  for  the  decontamination  process,  a  description  of  the  personal  pro-
tective equipment that will be used, health and safety procedures, and a list of post-
decontamination testing that will be completed. In addition to above discussed train-
ing  and  certification  requirements,  Washington  has  also  established  a  training  pro-
vider certification process.
Standards for Decontamination

Currently, approximately seven states have established—by statute, regulation or
guideline—a  feasibility-based  decontamination  standard  specific  to  methamphet-
amine. Feasibility-based is a cost-comparative term used to determine what the eco-

29

nomics  are  of  cleaning  a  meth  lab;  simply  put,  ‘‘how  much  do  we  want  to  spend  to
clean  it  up?’’  Those  states  include  Alaska,  Arizona,  Arkansas,  Colorado,  Minnesota,
Tennessee,  and  Washington.  The  two  most  commonly  provided  measurements  are
0.1µg/100cm2 and  0.5µg/ft2.  There  is  an  ongoing  debate  about  the  effectiveness  of
using  a  feasibility-based  standard.  Because  research  into  the  long-term  health  ef-
fects associated with clandestine laboratories has just recently begun, health or risk
based  standards  have  not  been  determined  yet.  These  standards  are  usually  deter-
mined  by  asking,  ‘‘to  what  level  do  we  need  to  minimize  (clean)  a  contaminant  in
order to prevent the average person from having adverse health effects (e.g., become
sick)?’’  This  is  based  upon  the  toxicology  of  a  compound,  the  concentration  of  the
contaminant, and the amount of time a person will be exposed to that concentration.
Minus the research needed to set these standards, states are relying on the limited
research available to determine the appropriate feasibility-based standard that must
be  met  by  a  cleanup  contractor  and/or  industrial  hygienist  in  order  to  certify  that
a property has been decontaminated.
Property Notices re: Former Meth Lab Sites

There  are  also  several  notice  issues  involved  in  the  cleanup  and  remediation  of
properties  contaminated  by  clandestine  laboratories.  A  few  states  have  statutory
and/or  regulatory  provisions  that  require  a  particular  agency  to  maintain  a  list  of
contaminated properties and/or a list of certified contractors that must be available
to  the  public.  A  property  is  generally  removed  from  the  contamination  list  once  it
is certified by the appropriate entity as decontaminated. Another issue relates to the
notifying  of  the  county  recorder’s  office  that  a  property  has  been  deemed  contami-
nated.  In  Washington,  the  local  health  officer  is  required  to  file  a  copy  of  an  order
prohibiting  the  use  of  a  property  with  the  county  auditor.  If,  after  the  remediation
process  is  complete,  the  local  health  officer  determines  that  the  property  has  been
decontaminated,  s/he  is  required  to  record  a  release  for  reuse  document  in  the  real
property  records  of  the  county  auditor  where  the  property  is  located.  The  county
auditor  provisions  are  located  within  the  purview  of  the  chapter  on  the  decon-
tamination  of  illegal  drug  manufacturing  or  storage  sites.  Additional  states  may
have  similar  statutory  and  regulatory  provisions  relating  to  the  recording  of  prop-
erty contamination in other parts of the state code.

Numerous states have become concerned with presently or formerly contaminated
properties  being  sold,  transferred,  or  rented  without  the  buyer  or  occupant  being
made  aware  of  the  status  of  the  property.  Such  disclosure  issues  and  restriction  on
the  transfer  of  the  property  have  been  addressed  in  many  different  areas  of  the
state code. Arizona, Alaska, and Oregon, in particular, address this issue within the
purview of their cleanup laws and regulations. The statutes and/or regulations gen-
erally  require  the  seller  to  notify  the  buyer  in  writing  that  illegal  drug  manufac-
turing  occurred  on  the  premises.  A  buyer  then  may  cancel  the  purchase  contract
within  a  certain  number  of  days  after  receiving  notice  of  the  property’s  status.  In
Oregon,  if  the  seller  fails  to  properly  notify  the  buyer,  the  buyer  may  bring  suit  to
recover  damages  for  any  losses.  In  Arizona,  the  seller  is  subject  to  civil  penalties
for  any  harm  that  was  caused  for  his/her  failure  to  comply  with  its  notice  require-
ments.
Local Ordinances

As  mentioned  earlier,  numerous  local  governments  (e.g.,  cities,  municipalities)
have passed ordinances that relate to the cleanup of methamphetamine laboratories.
Some of the ordinances address nuisance and local building code issues. Other ordi-
nances  address  cleanup  and  remediation  directly.  Ordinances  can  be  found  both  in
states  that  already  have  related  statutes  and  regulations  as  well  as  in  states  that
have not yet addressed the issue at the State level.
Current  Considerations  for  NAMSDL’s  Drafting  of  a  Model  Act/Guidelines
From  the  discussions  of  this  working  group,  existing  research  that  the  members
have  identified,  and  review  of  existing  laws,  policies,  guidelines,  and  ordinances,
NAMSDL has drafted the following outline for members’ consideration at their final
meeting at the end of April 2005. This preliminary outline suggests key components
to be addressed in a model act or model guidelines that NAMSDL might draft:
State Agency Authority:

departments in regulation probably)

• oversight of cleanup program (with designated responsibilities to local health
• set requirement for owner to clean property
• to promulgate related regulation
• keep database of properties deemed to be contaminated

• keep list of certified contractors and approved laboratories

Notification responsibilities:

• first  responder/law  enforcement/local  health  officer/building  code  officer/local

county property records office

• owner
• posting on property

Contractors/Industrial Hygienists:

• certification
• training
• site safety responsibilities
• monitoring of contractors work

Preliminary Assessment and Work Plan

Decontamination Procedures

• for walls, furniture, ventilation system, variety of surfaces
• waste characterization and disposal

Confirmation of Decontamination:
• decontamination standards
• sampling methods
• laboratory analytical testing

After receiving feedback from the National Working Group on Cleanup and Reme-
diation  of  Meth  Lab  Sites,  the  drafting  committee  of  NAMSDL’s  Board  of  Directors
will  complete  the  draft  model  act/guidelines.  Once  the  draft  is  approved  by  the
Board,  NAMSDL  will  distribute  the  resulting  model  to  our  contacts  in  the  states,
including  Governors  and  Attorneys  General.  The  model  will  also  be  posted  on
NAMSDL’s website (www.natlalliance.org).
Additional Research Is Needed

Working  group  members  agree  that  informed,  effective,  health-based  standards
for  cleanup  and  remediation  cannot  be  established  until  more  is  known  about  the
short- and long-term health and environmental consequences of meth production. A
consistent  theme  from  the  working  group’s  discussions  is  the  need  for  further  re-
search. At their most recent meeting, these members concluded that research needs
to occur on the following multiple tracks:

• Health-based studies (short- and long-term)
• Health-based cleanup standards
• Scientifically validated sample collection methods
• Scientifically validated remediation

Examples of specific research needs within these tracks suggested by the working
group members include: identifying the primary chemicals of concern (COCs), deter-
mining persistent COCs, determining if meth should be the only indicator chemical,
establishing  the  most  effective  remediation  technique  for  a  variety  of  surfaces  (e.g.,
porous,  semi-porous,  nonporous),  and  indoor  air  assessments  over  time.  Any  re-
search  that  addresses  these  concerns  and  questions  would  greatly  benefits  states’
efforts related to decontamination of former meth lab sites.
Concluding Remarks

NAMSDL  considers  all  of  the  Commission’s  model  laws  to  be  ‘‘living  and  breath-
ing’’  documents  that  can  offer  guidance  to  states  over  time  by  incorporating  new
findings  as  necessary.  The  model  act  or  guidelines  that  will  emerge  from  the  work-
ing  group  process  and  the  Board’s  drafting  will  also  be  viewed  as  such.  NAMSDL
will  incorporate  the  findings  of  new  research  and  new  developments  in  the  science
related  to  decontamination  of  meth  lab  sites  into  any  model  act/guidelines  that  is
drafted for states’ reference.

Thank  you  once  again  for  the  opportunity  to  share  this  information  with  you.  I

would be happy to answer any questions that you have as the hearing proceeds.

BIOGRAPHY FOR SHERRY L. GREEN

Sherry L. Green helped co-found the National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws
(Alliance)  in  1993  to  promote  the  model  state  laws  promulgated  by  the  President’s
Commission  on  Model  State  Drug  Laws  (Commission).  Ms.  Green  currently  serves
as Executive Director of the Alliance and was formerly the Associate Director of the
Commission.  As  Associate  Director,  she  was  a  primary  co-author  and  editor  of  the
Commission’s five volume Final Report containing 44 model laws and policies on en-
forcement, education, prevention, treatment and community issues.

As Director of the Alliance, Ms. Green has established a legislative clearinghouse
used by governors, state legislators, attorneys general and substance abuse special-
ists to track adoption of model law-related bills, monitor trends in drug and alcohol
abuse  policies,  and  identify  pertinent  studies,  reports  and  programs.  Additionally,
she  has  created  a  national  network  of  experts  who  provide  technical  assistance  to
state  leaders  on  the  model  laws  and  drug  and  alcohol  abuse  policies.  As  a  member
of the network, Ms. Green drafts and analyzes legislation, assists with policy devel-
opment, offers guidance on legal, technical and programmatic issues, facilitates for-
mation  of  multi-disciplinary  coalitions,  and  conducts  or  participates  in  legislative
briefings,  summits,  and  workshops.  Ms.  Green  also  makes  numerous  presentations
on the model laws to national and state organizations and agencies.

Previously,  Ms.  Green  spent  eight  years  specializing  in  state  legislative  research
and  policy,  analysis,  drafting  and  education.  She  served  as  an  Attorney  with  the
American  Prosecutors  Research  Institute  (APRI),  where  she  managed  the  model
drug  legislation  project.  During  her  tenure  with  APRI,  she  co-authored  the  State
Drug Laws for the 90s resource book. Ms. Green established and served on the Uni-
form Controlled Substance Act (UCSA) Task Force which produced model legislation
adopted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. Addi-
tionally, the Forfeiture Task Force wrote a model act passed in whole or in part by
several  states,  including  Louisiana,  Georgia,  Hawaii,  and  Arkansas.  Prior  to  her
work  with  the  Institute,  Ms.  Green  clerked  for  a  D.C.  Superior  Court  Judge  and
analyzed child support laws for the American Bar Association.

Ms.  Green  brings  to  her  legislative  work  a  background  in  law.  She  received  her
Juris  Doctor  from  the  George  Washington  University’s  National  Law  Center  and  is
a  member  of  the  D.C.  Bar.  Ms.  Green  also  received  a  Bachelor’s  degree  in  Political
Science-Economics from the University of Montana.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Dr. Martyny.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  JOHN  W.  MARTYNY,  PH.D.,  C.I.H.,  SENIOR
INDUSTRIAL  HYGIENIST,  DIVISION  OF  ENVIRONMENTAL
AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH SCIENCES, NATIONAL JEWISH
MEDICAL AND RESEARCH CENTER
Dr.  MARTYNY.  Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee,  first  I
would  like  to  thank  you  very  much  for  affording  me  this  oppor-
tunity  to  come  here  and  give  you  an  idea  of  what  we  are  finding
in  the  research  that  we  are  conducting  looking  at  chemical  expo-
sures in these illegal methamphetamine laboratories.

I  have  submitted  written  testimony,  which  gives  you  a  lot  more
detail than I could go into in the next five minutes, and I hope that
will  become  part  of  the  record.  But  I  will  try  to  summarize  some
of the things that we found, and really give you an idea of how im-
portant these exposures could actually be.

We were initially contacted by local law enforcement in Colorado,
and  they  were  concerned  because  a  number  of  their  law  enforce-
ment  individuals  were  going  into  these  labs  and  reporting  symp-
toms. About 50 percent of law enforcement officers going into these
labs  will  have  some  problem  when  they  come  out  of  the  lab.  Typi-
cally, it might be as easy as burning eyes, burning nose and throat,
but  can  be  much  worse.  In  some  cases,  officers  actually  have  to  go
to  the  hospital.  We  have  several  officers  that  have  been  taken  to
the hospital after responding to these methamphetamine labs.

We  were  very,  very  lucky  in  that  law  enforcement  allowed  us  to
go  with  them,  actually  out  to  the  labs.  We  went  in  right  behind
them,  actually  a  little  ways  behind  them,  just  to  make  sure.  And
we  quickly  got  to  look  at  the  contamination  that  is  in  these  labs
and the chemicals that the police are exposed to. We were also ex-
tremely lucky and fortunate in that the Drug Enforcement Admin-
istration was able to work with us and allow us to do our own cook.
So to date, we have done quite a few meth cooks using the different
methodologies  of  cooking  meth  and  trying  to  decide  what  kind  of
exposures  we  really  have.  And  I  have  to  tell  you,  we  have  been
very surprised. Generally speaking, the chemicals that are used re-
sult  in  extremely  high  concentrations  of  exposure  to  iodine,  hydro-
gen chloride, phosphine gas, and anhydrous ammonia, actually lev-
els  that  exceed  what  NIOSH,  the  National  Institute  of  Occupa-
tional Safety and Health, considers to be immediately dangerous to
life  and  health  during  the  actual  cook.  So  these  are  not  trivial  ex-
posures.

The  bad  thing  is  that  these  exposures  move  not  from  just  the
area  that  the  cook  is  but  throughout  the  house  or  throughout  the
building where the cook has occurred, and in fact, we were able to
do  one  cook  in  a  hotel  room  and  found  out  that  we  actually  had
the  exposures  move  to  each  room  bordering  that  particular  room,
which  is  a  real  concern  for  us,  because  now  we  are  talking  about
not only the people doing the cook, but also third parties.

When  we  were  going  into  the  actual  labs  themselves,  the  one
thing  that  we  found  is  virtually  every  lab  that  is  contaminated
with methamphetamine itself, the methamphetamine is essentially
all throughout the lab, on the walls, floors, ceiling, in the carpeting.
It  moves  well  outside  the  cook  area,  and  really  offers  contamina-
tion—or  offers  people  to  get  exposed  that  were  not  even  remotely
concerned  with  the  methamphetamine  cook.  So  we  get  very,  very
concerned  about  third  parties.  We  get  very,  very  concerned  about
children that may not be present during the cook but, in fact, come
into  the  house  after  the  cook  into  an  extremely  contaminated
house.  Recently,  the  Colorado  Department  of  Public  Health  and
Environment has looked at a lot of the data that we have accumu-
lated  with  types  of  contamination  we  see  well  after  the  cook  and
has found that the toxicologists would expect kids exposed to those
levels  to  actually  show  permanent  damage,  especially  to  the  res-
piratory  tract,  possibly  to  the  nervous  system,  and  so  we  are  very,
very concerned about this.

As  much  as  we  do  know,  there  is  a  lot  that  we  don’t  know.  We
don’t know how long it lasts in the house. Unfortunately, all of the
houses that we have cooked in, we have had to actually destroy the
house  right  after  our  cook  for  liability  purposes.  And  so  we  have
no  idea.  Does  this  last  six  months,  a  year,  two  years?  We  don’t
know.

How  do  activities  reduce  exposures  in  the  house?  What  happens
when  you  vacuum?  If  you  have  got  a  carpet  that  is  soaked  with
methamphetamine,  what  happens  when  you  vacuum  the  house?
What  are  the  exposures  to  the  kids  and  the  other  people  around?
We have done very little on methamphetamine clean up. What are
the  best  ways  to  clean  it  up?  As  was  mentioned,  as  Sherry  men-
tioned, some people feel the house needs to be destroyed. Some peo-

ple  feel  that  all  that  needs  to  be  done  is  for  it  to  be  aired  out.  We
think that there is a lot to be learned there.

We would really hope that we can count on your support for this
bill.  We  are  really  interested  in  bringing  EPA  into  the  arena.  We
would  also  like  to  see  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  (CDC)  be
brought  in.  CDC  is  doing  some  studies  now.  We  would  like  to  see
them  do  more,  looking  at  why  we  are  seeing  some  of  these  health
effects  for  people  that—even  occupying  just  houses  that  had  been
used for cooks in the past.

We  certainly  appreciate  the  support  of  NIST  being  able  to  look
at  new  methodologies  and  also  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences.
I do have a short film clip that I would like to show you of a cook

that we actually did.

[Film.]
This  is  a  cook  using  the  anhydrous  ammonia  method  of  cooking.
And  you  will  see  actually  a  tube  here  where  we  actually  are  sam-
pling the air to see what levels we have and to see how—there are
tremendous  amounts  of  anhydrous  ammonia,  probably  around
2,000  parts  per  million.  This  is  actually  stirring.  You  can  see  the
anhydrous  ammonia  is  actually  coming  off.  That  was  the  detector
tube. We had about 2,000 when we pulled that and it was instantly
saturated.  This  is  pH  tape,  and  it  is  actually  changing  color  just
due  to  the  atmosphere  in  the  house.  The  pH  is  so  high,  it  just
changes  the  pH  tape  immediately.  And  this  is  actually  a  mixture
of hydrogen chloride and methamphetamine. It is going into the air
where the cook is being conducted.

Thank you very much.

My name is John W. Martyny. I am an Associate Professor and an industrial hy-
gienist  at  the  National  Jewish  Medical  and  Research  Center.  I  also  hold  the  rank
of  Associate  Professor  in  the  Department  of  Preventive  Medicine  at  the  University
of Colorado Denver/Health Sciences Center. I wish to inform you of recent research
that we have conducted regarding the chemical exposures associated with the clan-
destine  manufacture  of  methamphetamine.  Our  research  has  indicated  that  very
high  levels  of  toxic  chemicals  are  produced  during  methamphetamine  ‘‘cooks;’’  and
that  hazardous  chemical  exposures  can  be  expected  to  persist  in  rooms  and  build-
ings for an extended period of time.

Prior to discussing our research findings, I wish to acknowledge the contributions
made  by  many  groups  in  conducting  this  research.  The  study  was  initiated  due  to
exposure  concerns  expressed  by  local  law  enforcement  officials  in  Colorado,  includ-
ing the North Metro Task Force in Denver, Colorado. We also obtained enthusiastic
help and assistance from local and State law enforcement, fire, and emergency serv-
ices personnel from Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. I have attached to this testi-
mony a complete list of participating organizations.

In order to obtain exposure data, we collaborated with agents and chemists work-
ing  for  the  U.S.  Drug  Enforcement  Administration  who  conducted  controlled  meth-
amphetamine  ‘‘cooks’’  while  we  measured  the  chemicals  being  released.  Without
their  help,  this  information  would  not  have  been  obtainable.  DEA  Administrator
Karen  P.  Tandy  has  been  very  supportive  in  this  effort.  Senator  Ben  Nighthorse
Campbell was also helpful in providing some initial funding for our effort.

We  have  received  financial  support  from  the  U.S.  Justice  Department  through
Community Action Policing Services, the Centers for Disease Control/National Insti-
tute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and HealthOne Foundation of Col-
orado. We gratefully acknowledge the help we have received from the National and
the  Colorado  Drug  Endangered  Children  Coalitions.  Full  reports  of  our  studies  can

Introduction

Our  nation  faces  an  unprecedented  epidemic  of  clandestine  methamphetamine
drug  manufacturing.  Seizures  of  methamphetamine  drug  laboratories  continue  to
rise, putting police and fire first responders at risk for a variety of hazards. For ex-
ample, the number of seizures in my home State of Colorado has risen dramatically
from  31  laboratories  in  1998  to  687  laboratories  in  2002.  First  responders  and  sus-
ceptible  third  parties,  especially  children,  are  at  risk  for  exposures  to  the  chemical
hazards as well as the fire, explosion, and safety hazards inherent with the clandes-
tine manufacture of methamphetamine.

Unfortunately, very little research has been conducted regarding the specific expo-
sure  hazards  associated  with  illegal  methamphetamine  manufacture.  The  lack  of
knowledge has produced four serious problems:
1. Inconsistent medical treatment of chemically exposed individuals:

Because  of  the  lack  of  information  on  exposure  levels,  there  has  been  very  poor
information on which to establish appropriate medical treatment plans. Health care
providers  providing  treatment  to  individuals  exposed  at  methamphetamine  labora-
tories  were  forced  to  provide  generic,  often  expensive,  and  probably  to  some  extent
unnecessary, medical testing.
2. Inconsistent  recommendations  for  protection  of  emergency  service  and

law enforcement workers:
The  use  of  personal  protective  equipment  (PPE)  by  emergency  services  and  law
enforcement personnel has varied widely by jurisdiction due to the lack of informa-
tion  regarding  chemical  exposures  at  the  sites.  Some  jurisdictions  utilize  self-con-
tained breathing apparatus (masks with air tanks worn on the back) and chemical-
protective  suits  while  neighboring  jurisdictions  use  no  respiratory  protection  or
chemical-protective suits at all. Other agencies switch from self-contained breathing
apparatus  to  air-purifying  respirators  (face  masks  with  filters)  after  the  initial  as-
sessment,  while  some  agencies  remain  in  the  highest  levels  of  protection.  These  in-
consistencies are due to a lack of information from scientifically-based studies of the
exposure risks while conducting these operations.
3. Preventable injuries and illness occurring among emergency service and

law enforcement workers:
Even  though  many  agencies  use  some  form  of  PPE,  there  are  increasing  reports
of emergency service and law enforcement personnel being injured while conducting
investigations  at  clandestine  methamphetamine  laboratories.  The  Centers  for  Dis-
ease  Control  reported  59  events  between  1996  and  1999,  associated  with  meth-
amphetamine  labs  where  emergency  services  personnel  were  injured  during  the  in-
vestigation. The number of injured responders was 155, with the most predominant
symptom reported being respiratory irritation.

Studies conducted by Dr. Jeffrey Burgess, while at the University of Washington,
investigated  the  symptoms  reported  by  emergency  responders  during  illegal  meth-
amphetamine  laboratory  seizures.  Responders  predominately  reported  general  irri-
tant  symptoms,  but  least  one  case  of  phosphine  gas  exposure  (a  gas  that  may  be
lethal  at  low  concentrations)  was  reported.  In  a  questionnaire  study  of  emergency
responders,  53.8  percent  reported  at  least  one  illness  while  conducting  laboratory
seizures  with  most  symptoms  appearing  to  be  related  to  chemical  exposure  at  the
laboratory  site.  The  primary  symptoms  reported  were  headache  and  mucous  mem-
brane irritation.

Although  the  predominant  symptoms  were  irritant  symptoms,  a  number  of  re-
sponders were found to have an accelerated decline in their ability to breathe (deter-
mined  by  a  breathing  test  which  measures  how  fast  they  can  blow  air  out  of  their
lungs)  that  may  have  been  related  to  work  in  drug  laboratories.  The  majority  of
symptoms  reported  by  officers  occurred  during  the  processing  phase  of  the  labora-
tory  seizures  but  this  phase  was  also  the  phase  in  which  the  most  time  was  spent
in the laboratory area. The use of respiratory protection did seem to reduce the inci-
dence of symptoms while investigating these laboratories. There has also been anec-
dotal evidence of these chemical exposures causing permanent lung damage, but the
actual cases have not been reported in the literature.
4. Inadequate  hazards  training  and  education  of  emergency  services  and

law enforcement personnel:
If  the  exposures  encountered  in  methamphetamine  laboratories  are  not  known,
then it is difficult to properly educate personnel about the risks they may encounter
when entering an illegal laboratory. Although the chemicals used in the production
of  methamphetamine  are  well  known,  first  responders  do  not  know  which  of  these

35

chemicals by themselves or in combination may be harmful and what routes of expo-
sure  present  the  most  severe  risks.  Industrial  hygienists  commonly  approach  such
problems  by  quantifying  the  actual  exposures  using  air  sampling,  modeling,  and  in
some  cases  teamed  with  occupational  environmental  medical  specialists  using  bio-
logical  markers  (chemical  traces  in  urine  or  blood,  for  example)  to  determine  what
the  exposure  has  been.  Major  exposure  assessment  issues  include  individual  chem-
ical  characteristics  as  well  as  potentially  complex  interactions  of  chemicals  that
might result in unusual and potentially very toxic mixtures.
Summary of our research findings

Our  research  was  designed  to  determine  the  potential  chemical  exposures  to  law
enforcement  and  emergency  services  personnel  responding  to  clandestine  meth-
amphetamine  laboratory  seizures.  As  our  research  continued,  however,  we  became
increasingly concerned, as well, about the potential exposures to third party individ-
uals  that  were  incidentally  exposed  to  these  laboratories.  Chief  among  these  are
concerns was the health and well being of the children associated with these labora-
tories.  Approximately  one  third  of  the  methamphetamine  laboratories  investigated
by law enforcement involve children. In addition, there have been instances of fami-
lies  unknowingly  moving  into  a  building  that  had  previously  been  a  methamphet-
amine laboratory. The occurrence of a clandestine ‘‘cook’’ was only evident after sig-
nificant lung problems were diagnosed in the children.
Methodologies

Our  research  has  consisted  of  two  phases;  a  series  of  controlled  ‘‘cooks’’  docu-
menting  exposures  during  differing  manufacturing  methods  and  the  sampling  of
conditions  present  at  a  number  of  laboratories  being  investigated  by  law  enforce-
ment  officers.  The  controlled  ‘‘cooks’’  were  designed  to  determine  the  levels  of  con-
tamination associated with the ‘‘cooks’’ and the area over which these exposures are
spread.  The  sampling  of  laboratory  investigations  was  conducted  in  order  to  deter-
mine residual exposures present after the ‘‘cooks’’ have been conducted.

The controlled methamphetamine ‘‘cooks’’ were conducted in three residences and
a  hotel  that  were  slated  for  demolition.  These  ‘‘cooks’’  were  conducted  by  law  en-
forcement  chemists  using  similar  chemicals  and  equipment,  and  under  similar  con-
ditions  typically  observed  in  clandestine  laboratories.  Two  of  the  ‘‘cooks’’  were  con-
ducted using the red phosphorous reduction method and two used the Birch method,
which  uses  anhydrous  ammonia  and  lithium  metal  to  produce  methamphetamine.
Airborne sampling for hydrochloric acid, iodine, phosphine, and anhydrous ammonia
was  conducted  using  methods  specified  in  the  National  Institute  of  Occupational
Safety  and  Health  (NIOSH)  Manual  of  Analytical  Methods.  Real-time  analysis  for
hydrochloric  acid  and  phosphine  were  also  obtained  using  an  ITX  Multi-Gas  Mon-
itor. Real-time analysis for anhydrous ammonia was obtained using colorimetric de-
tector  tubes.  Airborne  and  surface  levels  of  methamphetamine  were  determined
using  a  method  being  developed  for  NIOSH  by  Data  Chem  Laboratories  in  Salt
Lake  City,  UT.  The  levels  of  chemicals  observed  were  compared  to  the  American
Conference  of  Governmental  Industrial  Hygiene  (ACGIH)  Threshold  Limit  Values
(TLV)  and  the  NIOSH  Immediately  Dangerous  to  Life  and  Health  Levels  (IDLH).
Controlled Cook Results
Red Phosphorous ‘‘Cooks’’

The  red  phosphorous  method  of  producing  methamphetamine  involves  the  use  of
a number of solvents, iodine, hydrogen chloride gas (frequently manufactured using
sulfuric acid and rock salt (NaCl) ), red phosphorous, sodium hydroxide, and ephed-
rine  or  pseudoephedrine.  This  method  requires  heating  of  the  materials  as  well  as
a reasonable amount of manipulation (filtering and bubbling hydrogen chloride into
the  solution)  that  generally  results  in  significant  contamination  by  the  primary
chemicals  as  well  as  other  chemicals  produced  by  the  combination  and  heating  of
the primary chemicals.

Our  analysis  of  the  exposures  present  during  red  phosphorous  ‘‘cooks’’  has  re-
vealed  significant  exposures  to  solvents,  phosphine,  iodine,  hydrogen  chloride,  and
methamphetamine aerosol. Phosphine is a gas produced when the solution of iodine,
water, ephedrine, and red phosphorous is heated. It is a gas that may cause severe
pulmonary  irritation  resulting  in  pulmonary  edema  and  death.  At  lower  levels
phosphine  may  cause  nausea,  vomiting,  headache,  and  chest  tightness,  symptoms
frequently reported by law enforcement personnel exposed to these laboratories. Un-
fortunately,  there  have  also  been  several  deaths  reported  in  ‘‘cooks’’  that  have  pos-
sibly  been  associated  with  phosphine  exposures.  Our  controlled  ‘‘cooks’’  have  re-
sulted  in  measured  phosphine  levels  ranging  from  not  detectable  to  as  high  as  2.9

ppm,  approximately  three  times  the  short-term  occupational  exposure  standard  of
1.0 ppm.

Although  a  seemingly  harmless  chemical  when  applied  to  the  skin,  iodine  can  be
very toxic when inhaled. The level of iodine considered by NIOSH to be Immediately
Dangerous  to  Life  and  Health  (IDLH)  is  only  two  ppm  and  levels  lower  than  0.1
ppm are required in the workplace. After a red phosphorous cook, iodine contamina-
tion can generally be found on many surfaces in the ‘‘cook’’ area and we have meas-
ured  levels  as  high  as  0.16  ppm  in  the  air  during  the  ‘‘cook.’’  The  amount  present
in  the  air  seems  to  depend  upon  the  amount  of  water  used  during  the  ‘‘cook’’  and
the  temperature  of  the  ‘‘cook’’  with  hotter  ‘‘cooks’’  resulting  in  higher  levels  of  air-
borne iodine.

Many  different  types  of  solvents  are  utilized  during  the  production  of  meth-
amphetamine.  Methanol  and  ether  are  commonly  used 
the
pseudoephedrine  or  ephedrine  and  Coleman  Fuel  is  commonly  used  to  separate  the
methamphetamine  base  prior  to  acidification.  All  of  these  chemicals  are  extremely
flammable;  and  many  clandestine  methamphetamine  laboratories  are  found  after
the explosion and fire. These chemicals may also cause exposures resulting in nerv-
ous  system  damage  as  well  as  internal  organ  damage  (liver,  kidney,  etc.).  This  is
especially true for children with developing nervous systems.

to  extract 

Hydrogen  chloride  is  produced  during  the  acidification  phase  in  all  methamphet-
amine  ‘‘cooks.’’  It  is  typically  used  to  precipitate  the  methamphetamine  out  of  the
organic  solution.  It  can  be  produced  by  adding  aluminum  foil  to  muriatic  acid  (hy-
drochloric  acid)  or  by  mixing  sulfuric  acid  with  rock  salt.  In  either  case,  large
amounts  of  hydrogen  chloride  are  produced  and  become  airborne  in  any  red  phos-
phorous ‘‘cook.’’ We have found levels as high as 155 ppm during the ‘‘cook’’ and av-
erage  levels  of  hydrogen  chloride  are  almost  always  over  the  occupational  level  of
2.0  ppm.  This  chemical  can  cause  severe  upper  respiratory  tract  damage  and  may
result  in  permanent  lung  damage  to  adults  and  especially  to  children  and  infants
with  a  growing  respiratory  system.  The  current  NIOSH  IDLH  is  50  ppm,  which  is
the  level  that  we  frequently  encounter  during  these  cooks.  The  potential  for  injury
due to hydrogen chloride is very high.

While  the  hydrogen  chloride  is  being  used  to  precipitate  the  methamphetamine
out  of  solution,  a  significant  amount  of  methamphetamine  itself  is  bubbled  out  of
the solution and into the air. The methamphetamine can then be found to plate out
on surfaces quite distant from the cook, and levels of methamphetamine as high as
16,000  µg/100  cm2 can  be  found  in  houses  that  were  used  to  produce  methamphet-
amine.  These  levels  can  persist  and  we  typically  find  as  much  as  300  µg/100  cm2
in  homes  that  were  used  for  methamphetamine  production,  even  as  long  as  six
months  after  the  last  use.  Airborne  levels  of  methamphetamine  may  be  as  high  as
5000  µg/m3 during  the  cook  and  almost  assures  that  anyone  in  the  vicinity  of  the
cook  will  test  positive  for  methamphetamine,  even  infants.  Due  to  this  widespread
deposition of methamphetamine throughout the house, virtually all items within the
house as well as all people, pets, toys, etc., become contaminated with methamphet-
amine.

In  general,  anyone  present  during  the  clandestine  production  of  methamphet-
amine using the red phosphorous method is highly likely to become exposed to toxic
levels  of  phosphine,  hydrogen  chloride,  iodine,  solvents,  and  to  high  levels  of  the
drug itself. These levels will be exceptionally high for children and infants who, due
to  their  developing  physiology  and  their  inquisitive  oral  habits,  will  be  exposed  to
high  levels  of  these  chemicals  at  a  very  sensitive  time  of  their  development.  The
final cost to these children may not be identified for many years to come.
Anhydrous Ammonia ‘‘Cooks’’

The  anhydrous  ammonia  ‘‘cooks’’  differ  from  the  red  phosphorous  ‘‘cooks’’  in  that
they  use  anhydrous  ammonia  and  a  reactive  metal  (lithium  or  sodium)  instead  of
red  phosphorous  and  iodine.  This  method  of  production  still  produces  significant
amounts  of  solvents,  hydrogen  chloride  and  methamphetamine  but  phosphine  and
iodine are not produced. The levels of anhydrous ammonia that are produced during
these ‘‘cooks’’ are significantly above NIOSH IDLH levels and the likelihood of seri-
ous injury to the respiratory system is high. Ammonia levels easily reach 1000 ppm
with average levels of 500 ppm common. The current NIOSH IDLH is 300 ppm, well
below  the  levels  that  we  observe  during  the  ‘‘cooks.’’  Adults  exposed  to  these  levels
may  be  expected  to  have  injury  to  the  respiratory  system  as  well  as  eye  damage.
The  reactions  of  children  and  infants  can  be  expected  to  be  much  greater  and  to
persist for longer periods.

Conclusions

Our  studies  indicate  that  methamphetamine  production  and  use  will  have  far-
reaching  effects  upon  the  individuals  using  this  drug,  their  children,  others  in  the
vicinity,  and  even  individuals  moving  into  the  ‘‘cook’’  areas  well  after  the  cook  has
moved  on  to  another  area.  It  is  unlike  the  use  of  many  drugs  in  that  there  is  not
only  an  exposure  to  the  drug  itself,  but  also  to  the  hazardous  and  toxic  chemicals
used  for  the  drug’s  production.  It  is  almost  a  given  that  the  following  will  occur:
• The cook and anyone assisting the cook will be exposed to a number of chemi-
cals (phosphine, hydrogen chloride, iodine, anhydrous ammonia, and solvents)
at  levels  that  are  above  those  allowed  by  law  in  occupational  settings  and,
in  some  cases,  above  those  levels  determined  to  be  ‘‘immediately  dangerous
to life and health.’’
• Third  party  bystanders,  including  children  and  infants,  are  likely  to  be  ex-
posed  to  levels  of  those  same  chemicals  that  may  cause  severe  and  long-last-
ing  health  concerns.  This  is  especially  true  of  children  and  infants  who  are
rapidly growing and more susceptible to chemical exposures in the home envi-
ronment.
• Law  enforcement,  fire,  and  emergency  services  personnel  may  be  exposed  to
high  levels  of  these  chemicals  as  they  investigate  clandestine  methamphet-
amine  laboratories.  This  is  especially  true  if  they  enter  an  area  where  a  lab-
oratory  is  in  operation  but  also  may  be  true  if  the  laboratory  is  not  in  oper-
ation  at  the  time.  Residual  chemicals  deposited  on  surfaces  of  the  house  as
well as boxes of chemicals stored in the house may result in significant expo-
sures to investigating personnel.
• The  area  used  to  produce  methamphetamine  and  surrounding  areas  will  be
contaminated with a number of chemicals including hydrogen chloride, iodine,
solvents, and the methamphetamine itself. Levels of these compounds may re-
main in the area for an extended period of time (at least six months) and may
result  in  exposures  to  individuals  that  were  not  associated  with  the  ‘‘cook’’
and, in fact, never knew of the existence of the methamphetamine production.

What Don’t We Know?
What are the long-term health effects for exposed children?

In spite of all we do know about the potential effects of methamphetamine produc-
tion  on  the  community,  there  is  still  much  that  we  don’t  know.  At  this  time  we  do
not have much information on the long-lasting health effects caused by exposure to
clandestine methamphetamine laboratories. This may seem like information that is
easily  obtainable,  but  several  factors  have  limited  our  knowledge  in  this  area.  The
explosion of these clandestine laboratories has occurred during the last 10 years and
has  been  studied  for  even  a  shorter  period.  This  combined  with  laws  limiting  the
collection  of  health  information  from  individuals  has  hampered  our  ability  to  track
exposed individuals for long periods of time.

Information regarding long-term effects in children is especially needed, since the
knowledge of potential physiologic and psychological conditions resulting from these
exposures in children may help in our treatment for these individuals. Some physi-
cians  and  psychologists  working  with  methamphetamine  lab  exposed  children  have
reported significant concerns that seem to be unique to this exposure. Indeed, since
almost  all  of  the  children  from  these  laboratories  test  positive  for  the  drug  itself,
which we have found on most surfaces of the house, exposure to the other chemicals
is  also  likely.  Many  of  these  chemicals  can  be  related  to  pulmonary  problems  such
as asthma and pulmonary fibrosis as well as liver and nervous system damage. The
drug itself is a neurological agent that can result in significant psychological condi-
tions  in  adults  using  the  drug.  Are  these  same  conditions  possible  in  the  exposed
children?  Is  it  possible  that  even  more  severe  developmental,  psychosocial,  and
physical effects may occur in children exposed over a long period of time? We know
that  the  brain  undergoes  significant  changes  in  early  childhood.  Does  exposure  to
methamphetamine  at  this  time  result  in  significant  effects  upon  brain  development
that will not be recognized until later in life?
What  are  the  long-term  chemical  exposures  associated  with  methamphetamine  lab-

oratories?

As part of the process in determining the effect of methamphetamine and its pre-
cursor chemicals on children, we need to determine the magnitude of the exposures
to children present in a home not only during, but after the ‘‘cook’’ has taken place.

entering  the  structure  after  the  ‘‘cook.’’  We  now  need  to  conduct  controlled  ‘‘cooks’’
in  structures  located  in  a  secure  location  so  that  we  can  follow  the  exposures  over
time. What chemical exposures exist in the house a day after the cook? What about
a month after the cook? Are the exposures associated with the house at a year post-
‘‘cook’’ still dangerous? How do normal activities such as vacuuming, cleaning, cook-
ing  and  other  activities  affect  these  exposures?  How  do  the  potential  exposures  to
infants  crawling  around  the  house  differ  from  the  exposures  to  adults?  All  of  these
questions  are  important  in  determining  the  potential  health  effects  to  look  for  in
children as well as other adults residing in the building.
What are the best methodologies to use to control the spread of chemical contamina-

tion into the community?

Currently law enforcement agencies that take evidence, suspects, and children out
of  a  suspected  methamphetamine  laboratory  are  confronted  with  decontaminating
the  individuals  and  materials.  Some  agencies  conduct  the  decontamination  on-site
and  others  transport  the  individuals  to  a  hospital  for  decontamination.  In  some
cases, individuals have been transported without decontamination and hospital per-
sonnel have become ill from the exposures. What is the best methodology to use for
decontamination?  Which  decontamination  methods  result  in  the  least  amount  of
trauma for children associated with methamphetamine labs? We have been told that
a child able to take his or her favorite toy or object from the house may suffer much
less  trauma.  Are  there  ways  that  this  can  be  done?  Can  we  make  decontamination
child  friendly?  These  are  questions  that,  when  answered,  may  make  a  drug  raid
much less traumatic for the children innocently involved.
What are the risks of moving into a house that has been used as a methamphetamine

lab?

We  currently  know  that  individuals  moving  into  a  home  that  has  been  used  as
a  methamphetamine  laboratory  often  have  respiratory  problems.  This  is  especially
true  of  children  or  adults  with  asthma  or  other  respiratory  problems.  At  this  time
we  do  not  know  what  chemicals  cause  these  symptoms,  although  many  involved  in
the  process  affect  the  respiratory  system.  We  do  know  that  these  houses  seem  to
have  elevated  levels  of  methamphetamine  but  we  have  not  tested  the  homes  for
other compounds that may cause respiratory symptoms.
What  is  the  best  methodology  to  use  in  decontaminating  a  residence  that  has  been

used as a clandestine methamphetamine laboratory?

To  date  a  number  of  states  have  developed  standards  and  methodologies  for  the
cleanup  of  methamphetamine  labs.  These  standards  vary  from  state  to  state  al-
though  many  states  have  similar  standards.  Are  there  specific  remediation  steps
that  should  be  taken  in  all  decontamination  efforts?  What  decontamination  proce-
dures result in the lowest residual level of chemicals in the house? At what chemical
levels  should  most  people  be  unaffected?  Should  we  base  the  decontamination  on
methamphetamine  levels  as  is  currently  the  practice  in  most  states  or  should  we
look for other chemicals? These questions need to be answered in order to determine
when the decontamination program is complete and to prevent unnecessarily expen-
sive decontamination.

As these questions get answered, there will undoubtedly be more questions as we

begin to understand the complexity of this drug and its manufacture on society.
How will this bill help?
Voluntary guidelines for remediation. The ‘‘Methamphetamine Remediation Re-
search  Act  of  2005’’  sets  into  motion  several  programs.  It  requires  the  U.S.  EPA  to
establish  voluntary  guidelines  for  the  remediation  of  previous  clandestine  meth-
amphetamine  laboratories.  These  guidelines  will  be  able  to  combine  the  best  of  all
of  the  existing  State  guidelines  and  provide  a  national  guideline  that  will  be  avail-
able  to  all  states,  especially  those  that  are  new  to  the  problem.  The  result  will  be
more  uniform  remediation  guidelines  for  the  states  that  allow  homeowners  to  more
easily  understand  what  is  necessary  to  decontaminate  their  property.  Additionally,
a standard could unify potential practices for insurance providers, cleanup, disposal
and remediation companies.
Further  research.  The  bill  also  requires  that  the  EPA  support  research  so  that
we can begin to answer some of the questions previously mentioned as well as oth-
ers. At this time, very little funding is being directed at what has become a national
problem.  Concerns  regarding  methamphetamine  laboratories  can  be  found  in  the
media  on  a  daily  basis  and  many  public  concerns  can’t  be  adequately  answered  at
this  time.  The  bill  may  also  provide  funds  that  will  allow  us  to  scientifically  deter-
mine the serious health effects associated with methamphetamine manufacture that

at this time we are only able to identify through anecdotal observations by medical
and psychological professionals. Knowledge of the potential effects may help us help
the  children  and  infants  innocently  involved  with  this  drug  so  that  they  are  not
medical  or  sociological  burdens  upon  society  later  in  their  lives.  The  provision  re-
quiring  EPA  to  coordinate  research  with  the  National  Academy  of  Science  will  en-
able research to move forward in a directed fashion. The emphasis on the biological
effect on children and first responders is especially noteworthy.
Better dissemination of better information. The bill requires that the informa-
tion  gathered  by  the  EPA  be  disseminated  to  the  states  on  a  routine  basis.  This  is
extremely important since the dissemination of current information to all interested
individuals  is  very  important  in  establishing  a  uniform  methodology  of  combating
this  national  problem.  This  technology  transfer  must  be  accomplished  on  a  regular
and frequent basis to assure that the information is well used.
Better detection methods.  The  development  of  new  testing  methods  may  also  be
important to the determination of the risks involved in previous methamphetamine
labs  as  well  as  identifying  those  laboratories  in  the  field.  In  order  to  be  effective,
however,  any  new  methods  that  are  developed  must  be  validated  and  standardized
to assure that they provide accurate results in a timely fashion.

In  closing,  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  acquaint  you  with  the  results  of  our
research and the belief that we have regarding the importance of reducing this com-
munity  hazard.  Since  beginning  this  work,  it  has  been  my  privilege  to  meet  many
dedicated  individuals  that  have  devoted  their  time  and  efforts  to  protecting  society
and  especially  children  from  the  potentially  devastating  effects  of  these  clandestine
methamphetamine labs. Much of the work in this area has been conducted by indi-
viduals  on  their  own  time  and  at  their  own  expense.  This  shows  the  dedication  of
the  many  law  enforcement,  social  services,  public  health,  emergency  services,  and
research people working on this problem today. Thank you again for your time.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  HENRY  L.  HAMILTON,  ASSISTANT  COM-
MISSIONER,  PUBLIC  PROTECTION,  NEW  YORK  STATE  DE-
PARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
Mr.  HAMILTON.  Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee,  on
behalf of Acting Commissioner Sheehan, we want to thank you for
allowing  the  New  York  State  Department  of  Environmental  Con-
servation to present its views on the growing issue of methamphet-
amine  use  and  manufacture  in  New  York  State  and  on  how  H.R.
798 may assist the state with its efforts to stem this problem.

Under  Governor  Pataki,  New  York  State  law  enforcement,  and
public  safety  agencies,  including  this  Department,  are  prioritizing
a  variety  of  means  to  stop  illegal  drug  trafficking  in  New  York
State.  Because  of  the  Governor’s  various  criminal  justice  initia-
tives,  he  was  able  to  note  in  his  2005  State  of  the  State  address

that New York is now the safest large state in the Nation. But the
growing  threat  of  illegal  drugs,  like  methamphetamine,  makes  it
clear  that  we  must  continue  to  focus  resources  to  quell  this  threat
and  continue  our  progress  in  protecting  public  safety.  Governor
Pataki  has  proposed  legislation  that  would  specifically  target  clan-
destine laboratories, also known as clan labs, which produce illegal
drugs. The proposal imposes significant penalties upon the individ-
uals  who  operate  these  labs  as  well  as  those  who  assist  the  opera-
tors  by  knowingly  procuring,  transporting,  or  storing  the  sub-
stances or equipment needed.

In  New  York  State,  these  labs  are  most  frequently  located  in
rural  and  semi-rural  areas.  The  rate  at  which  these  labs  are  pro-
liferating  is  similar  to  that  which  began  occurring  in  the  Midwest
during  the  mid  to  late  1900s.  The  slower  growth  of  clan  labs  in
New  York  likely  stems  from  the  state’s  ban  on  the  sale  of  dietary
supplements  containing  ephedrine  alkaloids  beginning  in  1996.
Similar  federal  legislation  took  effect  in  April  of  2004.  Without
available sources of ephedrine alkaloids, clan labs have been forced
to  use  products  containing  pseudoephedrines,  such  as  over-the-
counter  decongestants,  which  are  much  more  time-consuming  to
distill.

Nevertheless,  methamphetamine  use  has  begun  to  grow  in  New
York State, particularly in New York City. This Department’s envi-
ronmental  conservation  officers,  made  up  of  both  uniformed  police
officers  and  plain-clothes  investigators,  work  with  federal,  State,
and local law enforcement agencies in investigating these clan labs.
In  conjunction  with  these  efforts,  the  Department’s  environmental
remediation  staff  attempt  to  locate  where  chemicals  from  the  clan
labs  have  been  disposed  and  coordinate  the  removal  of  chemicals
that  are  an  immediate  threat  to  public  health  and  the  environ-
ment.

Environmental  concerns  at  clan  labs  are  extensive.  A  variety  of
toxic  wastes  result  from  the  manufacture  of  methamphetamine.
These  chemicals  may  migrate  into  drinking  wells,  be  drained  into
septic  systems,  or  be  dumped  off  site.  It  is  estimated  that  for  each
pound  of  methamphetamine  produced,  four  to  six  pounds  of  toxic
waste are generated.

One  of  the  substances  of  greatest  concern  in  the  manufacture  of
methamphetamine,  of  course,  is  anhydrous  ammonia,  used  by
farmers  to  fertilize  crops.  Methamphetamine  manufacturers  have
been  known  to  steal  anhydrous  ammonia  from  storage  tanks  on
farms  and  at  agricultural  outlets  in  rural  areas.  Frequently,  they
leave  the  storage  tanks  open,  allowing  the  anhydrous  ammonia  to
empty  from  the  tank.  Anhydrous  ammonia,  as  has  been  said,  can
cause  severe  irritation  to  the  eyes,  nose,  throat,  and  lungs,  can
cause  dizziness,  chemical  burns,  and  can  seriously  affect  the  cen-
tral  nervous  system,  even  causing  death.  And  of  course,  there  is  a
potential for serious and very adverse environmental impacts.

Indoor environments may become contaminated when the chemi-
cals and fumes, as we have just seen in the videotape, formed dur-
ing  methamphetamine  production,  penetrate  or  adhere  to  porous
surfaces,  such  as  upholstery,  drapes,  linens,  carpeting,  wallpaper,
and  sheetrock.  Other  surfaces,  such  as  countertops  and  floors,  can
also be contaminated by spills and emissions.

As a result of these concerns, in August of 2004, Governor Pataki
signed legislation requiring this Department to conduct a study on
whether  or  not  it  would  be  feasible  to  introduce  an  additive  into
anhydrous ammonia that would prevent it from being used to man-
ufacture  methamphetamine.  The  statute  requires  that  the  Depart-
ment  issue  a  report  and  recommendations  by  April  1  of  next  year.
And in that context, we very much look forward to working with
this committee on strategies to address this growing threat to pub-
lic health and environmental quality.

Again, Mr. Chairman, thank you for allowing the Department of

Environmental Conservation to provide our comments.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Hamilton follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF HENRY L. HAMILTON

On behalf of Acting Commissioner Sheehan, I want to thank you for allowing the
New  York  State  Department  of  Environmental  Conservation  (Department)  to
present  its  views  on  the  growing  issue  of  methamphetamine  use  and  manufacture
in  New  York  State,  and  on  how  H.R.  798  may  assist  the  State  with  its  efforts  to

for Public Protection.

Under  Governor  George  E.  Pataki,  New  York  State  law  enforcement  and  public
safety  agencies,  including  the  Department,  are  prioritizing  a  variety  of  means  to
stem illegal drug trafficking in New York State. Through the initiatives which New
York’s  criminal  justice  agencies  have  put  in  place,  the  Governor  was  able  to  note
in  his  2005  State  of  the  State  address  that  New  York  is  now  the  safest  large  state
in the Nation. But the growing threat of illegal drugs like methamphetamine makes
it  clear  that  we  must  continue  to  focus  resources  to  quell  this  threat  and  continue
our  progress  in  protecting  public  safety.  Governor  Pataki  has  proposed  legislation
that would specifically target clandestine laboratories (clan labs) which produce ille-
gal  drugs.  The  proposal  also  makes  possession  of  specific  ingredients  used  to  ille-
gally  manufacture  controlled  substances  with  the  intent  to  manufacture  such  con-
trolled  substances  a  crime.  The  Governor’s  proposal  also  imposes  significant  pen-
alties  upon  the  individuals  who  operate  these  laboratories  as  well  as  those  who  as-
sist the operators by, among other things, knowingly procuring, transporting or stor-
ing the substances or equipment needed to operate the laboratories.

While I will focus today on the Department’s role, I want to emphasize the impor-
tance  of  all  the  involved  agencies,  working  together,  to  combat  this  growing  public
health and safety threat. Our State agencies have worked collaboratively to address
many issues surrounding the illegal manufacturing of methamphetamine. It has be-
come apparent that the problems associated with methamphetamine production, dis-
tribution  and  use,  are  very  broad  and  are  relevant  to  several  State  agencies.  As
such,  a  number  of  these  agencies  have  started  to  coordinate  and  work  toward  a
statewide  strategy  to  deal  with  these  issues.  Part  of  this  effort  will  be  to  continue
to look at deficiencies in State law and develop proposals to deal with these issues.
Operated  in  secret,  clan  labs  are  used  to  produce  chemical  or  biological  agents,
explosives, drugs or other hazardous substances. The most commonly occurring clan
labs are used to produce the drug methamphetamine. In New York State, these labs
are  most  frequently  located  in  rural  and  semi-rural  areas.  According  to  the  New
York  State  Police,  between  1989  and  1999,  there  were  only  four  methamphetamine
laboratories  found  in  New  York  State.  Since  then,  the  number  of  labs  has  risen
quickly  and  steadily,  from  eight  in  2000  to  19  in  2001,  45  in  2002,  and  73  in  2003.
The  rate  at  which  these  labs  are  proliferating  is  similar  to  what  began  occurring
in the Midwest during the mid to late 1990s.

There  are  about  150  different  ways  to  manufacture  methamphetamine.  Recipes
are readily available, including on the Internet, and so are the ingredients. In New
York State, the two most common manufacturing methods are known as the ‘‘Birch’’
method  and  the  ‘‘Red  Phosphorus’’  or  ‘‘Red  P’’  method.  The  former  is  found  mostly
in western New York State and some basic ingredients are pseudoephedrine/ephed-
rine,  anhydrous  ammonia,  lithium,  ether,  water  and  hydrochloric  acid.  The  latter
method, found mostly in central and northeastern New York State, utilizes, in addi-
tion to pseudoephedrine/ephedrine and hydrochloric acid, hydriodic acid, iodine, red
phosphorous from matchbook striker plate or road flares, and lye.

To  date,  fewer  clan  labs  have  been  identified  in  New  York  State  than  in  many
other  areas  of  the  country,  and  those  that  have  been  found  occur  mostly  in  areas

near  the  Pennsylvania  or  Canadian  borders.  The  slow  growth  of  clan  labs  in  the
state likely stems from the state’s ban of the sale of dietary supplements containing
ephedrine  alkaloids  in  1996.  Similar  federal  legislation  only  took  effect  in  April
2004. Without available sources of ephedrine alkaloids in New York State, clan labs
have  been  forced  to  use  products  containing  pseudoephedrines,  such  as  over-the-
counter decongestants, which are time-consuming to distill into illegal methamphet-
amine  drugs.  Nevertheless,  methamphetamine  use  has  begun  to  grow  in  New  York
State—particularly New York City.

The New York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse reports an increas-
ing  trend  in  methamphetamine  treatment  admissions  in  New  York  State.  There
were  approximately  500  admissions  in  1996  with  an  increase  to  almost  1,150  in
2003.  Significantly,  much  of  this  increase  is  attributable  to  clients  whose  primary
substance  abuse  involves  methamphetamine.  The  primary  route  of  administration
by users is oral, followed by smoking, inhalation and injection, respectively.

The  Department’s  Environmental  Conservation  Officers  (ECOs),  made  up  of  both
uniformed  police  officers  and  plainclothes  investigators,  work  with  other  federal,
State and local law enforcement agencies in investigating these clan labs. The crimi-
nal investigations on which the ECOs focus involve the threat to human health and
the environment, particularly the illegal disposal of hazardous waste, and toxic sub-
stances which may have been released into the environment. Violations of the New
York State Environmental Conservation Law by clan labs include misdemeanor and
felony pollution charges.

The  Department’s  environmental  remediation  staff  includes  responders  with  ex-
pertise  in  the  identification  and  clean  up  of  contaminated  sites,  including  those  at
which  the  volatile  chemicals  used  in  the  manufacture  of  methamphetamine  are
found.  In  conjunction  with  the  efforts  of  the  ECOs,  remediation  staff  attempt  to  lo-
cate where chemicals from the clan lab have been disposed, perform an initial iden-
tification of those chemicals found, and coordinate the removal of chemicals that are
an  immediate  threat  to  public  health,  safety  and  the  environment.  Given  the  vola-
tile nature of the chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamine, these activities
are hazardous, and require specialized training to ensure staff safety.

Environmental  concerns  at  clan  labs  are  extensive.  A  variety  of  ignitable,  corro-
sive, toxic or reactive wastes can result from the manufacture of methamphetamine.
Red  phosphorous,  lithium,  and  many  other  chemicals  used  during  production  of
methamphetamine  are  also  highly  flammable  or  combustible.  The  improper  han-
dling or storage of these items by methamphetamine users and producers increases
the  potential  for  fires  and  explosions.  Furthermore,  these  chemicals  may  migrate
into drinking wells; be drained into septic systems; or be dumped off-site. It is esti-
mated  that  for  each  pound  of  methamphetamine  produced,  four  to  six  pounds  of
toxic waste are generated.

‘‘Cookers,’’  the  people  involved  in  making  methamphetamine,  may  not  know  or
care about the dangers of the substances which they are using. Labs, which can be
located anywhere, from apartments and motel rooms to motor vehicles, can explode,
endangering the lives of anyone in the lab, as well as those who may reside nearby.
This  can  pose  a  particularly  dangerous  threat  to  children  living  in  or  near  these
labs. To ensure the safety of both law enforcement and remediation staff who must
deal  with  these  dangerous  sites,  and  to  facilitate  evidence  gathering,  the  Depart-
ment believes guidance should be developed to ensure the effective use of resources
and provide uniformity in responding to clan labs in New York State.

One  of  the  substances  of  greatest  concern  in  the  manufacture  of  methamphet-
amine is anhydrous ammonia. This liquid, which is used on farms to fertilize crops,
is  both  toxic  and  corrosive,  and  expands  to  800  times  its  original  volume  when  ex-
posed  to  ambient  air.  Methamphetamine  manufacturers  have  been  known  to  steal
quantities  of  anhydrous  ammonia  from  storage  tanks  on  farms  in  rural  areas.  Fre-
quently,  they  leave  the  anhydrous  ammonia  storage  tank  open,  allowing  the  anhy-
drous ammonia to empty out of the tank. As a gas, anhydrous ammonia reacts with
moisture  to  form  ammonium  hydroxide,  a  corrosive  substance  that  is  irritating  to
the  eyes,  nose,  throat,  lungs,  mucous  membranes  and  skin.  It  can  cause  dizziness,
chemical  burns,  and  can  seriously  affect  the  central  nervous  system,  even  causing
death.  Exposure  to  ammonia  vapors  may  result  in  pulmonary  edema.  Anyone  who
happens to come near such a tank as it is emptying is in danger. For the same rea-
son,  law  enforcement  personnel  stopping  a  suspect  after  an  anhydrous  ammonia
theft  might  be  in  danger.  Of  course,  there  is  also  a  potential  for  adverse  environ-
mental  impact  from  groundwater  contamination.  In  addition,  such  thefts  can  place
a significant financial hardship on the farmers from whom the anhydrous ammonia
was stolen.

Environmental  contamination  may  include  indoor  environments  as  well  as  out-
door environments such as soil, water supplies, septic systems and air. Indoor envi-

ronments  may  become  contaminated  when  the  chemicals  and  fumes  formed  during
methamphetamine production penetrate or adhere to porous surfaces such as uphol-
stery,  drapes,  linens,  carpeting,  and  sheet  rock.  Other  surfaces  (e.g.,  furniture,
counter tops, floors) can be contaminated by spills or emissions of chemicals during
drug  manufacture.  The  residues  in  these  indoor  environments  can  continually  ex-
pose  individuals  until  the  contaminated  surfaces  are  properly  cleaned  or  the  con-
taminated materials removed. Again, this type of environment can be a particularly
dangerous setting for children living in or near these labs.

As a result of these concerns related to anhydrous ammonia, in August 2004, Gov-
ernor  Pataki  signed  legislation  (Chapter  357,  Laws  of  2004)  requiring  the  Depart-
ment to conduct a study on whether or not it would be feasible to introduce an addi-
tive into anhydrous ammonia that would prevent it from being used to manufacture
methamphetamine. The statute takes effect on April 1, 2005, providing the Depart-
ment  with  time  to  work  with  the  New  York  State  Departments  of  Health,  Agri-
culture  and  Markets,  and  the  New  York  State  Police  to  study  and  make  rec-
ommendations  on  this  important  issue.  The  statute  requires  the  Department  to
issue a report containing such recommendations by April 1, 2006.

As  I  previously  mentioned,  our  State  agencies  have  worked  collaboratively  to  ad-
dress many issues surrounding the illegal manufacturing of methamphetamine and
we will continue this effort.

On behalf of Acting Commissioner Sheehan, I want to thank you for allowing the
Department to submit its comments on the activities which we currently undertake
to  investigate  and  remediate  clan  labs.  We  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Com-
mittee  on  strategies  to  address  this  growing  threat  to  the  State’s  public  health  and
environmental quality.

STATEMENT OF MR. GARY W. HOWARD, SHERIFF OF TIOGA

COUNTY, NEW YORK

Mr. HOWARD. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, my
name  is  Gary  Howard.  I  am  the  Sheriff  of  Tioga  County  situated
in  the  southern  tier  of  New  York.  I  want  to  thank  you  for  the  op-
portunity  to  come  here  today  and  discuss  my  experiences  with  the
threats posed by methamphetamine production.

The explosive growth of clandestine methamphetamine labs over
the last few years has presented a serious problem for law enforce-
ment  and  local  governments.  Methamphetamine  production  activi-
ties  within  New  York  State  have  increased  significantly  over  the
last  five  years.  Between  1989  and  1999,  there  were  only  four  labs
reported  in  New  York  State.  Last  year—or  in  the  year  2003,  the
Tioga County Sheriff’s Department had 28.

Exposure to the hazardous chemicals, the possibility of explosion,
fire,  and  violent  behavior  are  all  common  dangers  associated  with
the  production  of  methamphetamine.  Meth  users  are  oftentimes
paranoid  and  agitated,  always  thinking  everyone  is  out  to  get

them.  This  behavior  leads  them  to  use  surveillance  cameras  and
motion detectors as well as arming themselves to defend their oper-
ations.  In  2003,  October,  a  Tioga  County  man  was  shot  to  death
over  an  argument  of  anhydrous  ammonia.  During  that  incident,
there  were  seven  people  involved.  Every  one  of  them  was  armed
with a firearm at the time of this shooting.

According to the New York State Department of Health, approxi-
mately  47  percent  of  all  meth  labs  are  found  at  residential  prop-
erties. The operators of these labs are often neglectful in providing
the  basic  needs  of  their  family  and  normally  live  in  substandard
conditions.  Many  children  live  hand-in-hand  with  chemicals  or
toxic  substance  that  are  used  in  the  production  of  meth.  We  have
debriefed  children  from  meth  labs  and  have  been  told  stories  that
they had to wear masks while mommy and daddy are in the kitch-
en ‘‘making stuff.’’ One incident found a wife and a daughter sleep-
ing  while  her  husband  was  making  meth  in  the  kitchen.  He  mis-
handled  some  chemicals  and  a  flash  fire  erupted,  burning  the
house  down.  He  resulted  in  getting  second-degree  burns,  and  we
took his lab down.

Equipment, such as hypodermic needles, containers of anhydrous
ammonia solvents, and ether are found in kitchens, bedrooms, and
bathrooms  of  the  homes.  In  rural  areas,  garbage  from  the  process
is often taken outside and disposed of. During a recent raid, depu-
ties  found  a  defendant  dumping  ether  down  a  toilet  trying  to  de-
stroy  evidence.  At  another  raid,  law  enforcement  personnel  found
four  defendants  in  the  middle  of  a  cooking  process.  The  fifth  occu-
pant  of  the  residence  was  an  11-year-old  boy  who  was  wheelchair
bound  with  cerebral  palsy.  This  child  had  numerous  exposures  to
the meth process, and subsequently was turned over to the Depart-
ment of Social Services.

Meth  cooking  produces  solid  and  liquid  waste  that  can  contami-
nate a building. It is not only possible but likely that residual con-
taminants  are  left  on  surfaces  and  absorbent  materials,  such  as
carpets,  furniture,  sinks,  drains,  and  in  the  ventilation  and  drain
systems.  Solid  waste  product,  referred  to  as  ‘‘sludge,’’  which  is  the
leftover  remnants  of  the  process,  is  routinely  dumped  down  the
sinks,  drains,  and  toilets  or  discarded  outside  along  roads  or  in
somebody’s yard.

In  preparation  for  taking  down  a  suspected  meth  lab,  local  law
enforcement  will  spend  hundreds  of  hours  in  surveillance,  back-
ground,  and  undercover  work.  Briefings  of  law  enforcement,  emer-
gency  medical  service  people,  HAZMAT  people,  and  fire  depart-
ments  take  place  to  ensure  the  safety  of  all  involved.  The  Occupa-
tional Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) and the Public Em-
ployee Safety & Health Bureau (PESH) regulated safety gear must
be  obtained  and  used,  and  in  most  cases,  we  used  the  New  York
State Police county HAZMAT team for the collection of evidence.

To further complicate this problem in the growing trend of meth
is  what  are  known  as  ‘‘box  labs.’’  These  labs  are—all  of  the  equip-
ment  that  is  used  to  produce  methamphetamine  is  put  into  a  con-
tainer,  put  into  a  trunk  of  a  car,  and  in  one  night  is  used  in  one
residence and then moved to another residence the following night
where meth is made. We are running into these occasionally on the
road.

The  creation  of  H.R.  798  will  extend  help  to  local  governments
in the fight against this problem. The environmental impact of the
production  of  meth  may  not  be  known  for  years  to  come.  And  the
residual  effects  of  the  leftover  chemicals  pose  a  hazard  to  home-
owners  and  tenants  where  labs  were  once  located.  Having  stand-
ards  and  guidelines  as  outlined  will  help  establish  a  protocol  that
in  the  future  will  help  clean  up  meth  sites  and  protect  the  public.
And  I  want  to  thank  you  for  inviting  me  down  here,  Mr.  Chair-

man.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Howard follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF GARY W. HOWARD

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  my  name  is  Gary  W.  Howard;  I
am  the  Sheriff  of  Tioga  County,  located  in  the  southern  tier  of  New  York.  I  want
to  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  appear  today  to  discuss  my  experiences  with
the threats posed by methamphetamine production.

The Tioga County Sheriff’s Office has the largest law enforcement presence within
the  county  and  operates  a  102-bed  correctional  facility  with  49  corrections  officers
and  32  law  enforcement  officers.  There  are  five  criminal  investigators  who  inves-
tigate reported felony crimes to include all drug activity within Tioga County.

The  explosive  growth  of  clandestine  methamphetamine  labs  over  the  last  couple
of  years  presents  a  serious  problem  for  law  enforcement  and  local  government,  and
if  left  unchecked,  has  the  potential  to  present  far  reaching  problems  for  the  future.
Methamphetamine  production  activities  within  New  York  State  have  increased
significantly  over  the  last  five  years.  Between  1989  and  1999,  there  were  four  inci-
dents  reported  for  the  entire  State  of  New  York.  Since  then,  the  incidence  of  these
labs  in  New  York  State  has  risen  annually,  and  totals  193.  Eight  in  2000;  19  in
2001; 45 in 2002 and 73 in 2003. Of these 193 labs, 28 were located in Tioga County
and 25 in bordering Chemung County. The close proximity to Pennsylvania provides
indicators  for  the  number  of  labs  found  in  New  York.  In  2003,  16  of  the  58  labs
found  in  Pennsylvania  were  in  Bradford  County,  which  boarders  both  Tioga  and
Chemung counties.

Methamphetamine  labs  present  serious  dangers  to  law  enforcement,  EMS  per-
sonnel  and  other  service  providers,  as  well  as  the  public  at  large.  Exposure  to  haz-
ardous chemicals, the possibility of explosion, fire and violent behavior are all com-
mon  dangers  associated  with  the  production  of  methamphetamine.  Meth  users  are
often  times  paranoid  and  agitated,  always  thinking  that  everyone  is  ‘‘out  to  get
them.’’  This  behavior  leads  them  to  utilize  cameras  and  motion  sensors,  as  well  as
arming themselves to defend their operation. A grave reminder of the fact that fire-
arms  and  violence  are  common  with  these  labs,  occurred  during  two  separate  inci-
dents, within one year of the other. In the fall of October 2003, a Tioga County man
was  shot  to  death  over  an  argument  about  anhydrous  ammonia.  Seven  people  in-
volved  in  this  incident,  admitted  to  being  armed  with  a  firearm  at  the  time  of  the
shooting. In March 2004, two Bradford County, Pennsylvania Deputies were shot to
death  while  trying  to  serve  an  arrest  warrant  for  an  individual  wanted  for  meth-
amphetamine production.

Along  with  the  inherent  dangers  presented  by  the  suspects  themselves,  law  en-
forcement personnel, service providers, and the public who live near or have reason
to visit these labs face unseen hazardous chemicals, toxic waste and residue created
during  the  meth  cooking  process.  According  to  the  New  York  State  Department  of
Health, approximately 47 percent of meth labs were found in residential properties.
The  operators  of  these  labs  are  often  neglectful  in  providing  for  the  basic  needs  of
their family, and normally live in substandard conditions.

Many of the labs that are found are being conducted right in the kitchen or base-
ment  of  the  home.  Chemicals  such  as  Muriatic  Acid,  Acetone,  solvents,  and  ether
have been found in the kitchens, bedrooms and living rooms of the defendants.

Children  of  meth  users  have  told  stories  of  wearing  masks  while  Daddy  and
Mommy  ‘‘make  stuff’’  in  the  kitchen.  Children  have  been  found  sleeping  in  bed  or
on couches while their parents make meth in another part of the house.

One  incident  found  that  a  wife  and  daughter  were  sleeping  while  her  husband
was  making  meth  in  the  kitchen,  during  the  process  he  mishandled  one  of  the
chemicals  and  a  flash  fire  erupted,  causing  considerable  damage  to  the  residence
and resulting in second degree burns to the husband.

Equipment  such  as  hypodermic  needles,  containers  of  anhydrous  ammonia,  sol-
vents, and ether and are found kitchens, bedrooms and bathrooms of the homes. In

rural  areas  garbage  from  the  process  is  often  taken  outside  into  the  yard  and  burn
in piles to in an effort to destroy any of the evidence.

During  a  recent  raid,  Deputies  found  a  defendant  dumping  ether  down  the  toilet
trying  to  destroy  evidence,  while  others  ran  from  the  residence  trying  to  avoid  po-
lice, leaving their children behind.

Many children live hand-in-hand with chemicals or toxic substances that are used
in the production of meth. These chemicals are known to cause serious physical in-
juries.

Short-term, high concentration exposure to some of these chemicals can cause se-

vere health problems including lung damage and burns.

Every  meth 

At  another  raid,  law  enforcement  personnel  found  four  defendants  in  the  middle
of  the  cooking  process.  Another  occupant  of  the  residence  was  an  11-year-old  boy
who was wheelchair bound with cerebral palsy. This child had numerous exposures
to the production of meth. Subsequently, the boy was turned over to the Department
of Social Services.

‘‘recipe’’  starts  with  over-the-counter  medications  that  include
pseudoephedrine  or  ephedrine  in  their  contents.  The  pills  are  crushed  and  mixed
with  other  chemicals  in  the  process  of  cooking  meth.  Most  of  the  chemicals  associ-
ated  with  producing  meth  can  be  grouped  into  three  categories:  Solvents;  Metals
and  Salts;  and  Strong  acids  or  Bases.  Chemicals  such  as  Starter  Fluid;  Muriatic
Acid;  Drain  Cleaners;  Lithium  batteries;  Iodine,  and  Acetone  to  name  a  few,  are
commonly found in varying quantities.

The  cooking  process  causes  chemicals  and  methamphetamine  to  be  deposited  on
surfaces  and  household  belongings.  Production  also  releases  toxic  gasses,  including,
but  not  limited  to,  hydrochloric  acid,  hydrogen  chloride,  phosphine,  and  ammonia.
These gasses are released during the cooking process and can be deadly.

Meth  cooking  produces  solid  and  liquid  wastes  that  can  contaminate  a  building.
It is not only possible, but likely that residual contaminates are left on surfaces and
in absorbent materials, such as carpets, furniture, sinks, drains and ventilation sys-
tems.  The  solid  waste  product,  referred  to  as  ‘‘sludge’’  and  other  remnants  of  the
cooking  process  are  routinely  dumped  down  sinks,  drains  and  toilets,  or  discarded
outside along roads or in yards, left to leach into the soil and ground water, leaving
behind a virtual toxic dump of chemicals.

Exposure  to  these  meth  lab  chemicals  and  waste  products  can  result  in  minor  or
serious life threatening medical problems, depending on the circumstances of the ex-
posure.

The  eradication  of  clandestine  labs  exacts  a  serious  burden  on  local  law  enforce-
ment and government budgets and resources. In preparation for taking down a sus-
pected  meth  lab,  local  law  enforcement  must  spend  hundreds  of  man-hours  in  sur-
veillance, background and undercover work. Briefings of law enforcement, EMS, and
HAZMAT personnel must take place to insure the safety of all involved. OSHA and
PESH  required  safety  gear  must  be  obtained  and  deployed,  requiring  expensive
equipment and extensive training.

Beginning  in  1999  when  the  first  lab  of  this  type  was  found  in  Tioga  County,  in-
vestigators  began  to  educate  themselves  on  the  problem  that  now  exists.  Research-
ing law enforcement publications and speaking with agencies outside our area. This
was only a step into the education that was to follow. Credited schools, forums and
local training on meth labs followed to help in getting a grasp of what the problem
was.

Today the Sheriff’s Office has one investigator that is devoted full-time to the in-
vestigations  of  meth  labs  with  two  others  educating  the  public,  holding  classes  for
groups  such  as  Department  of  Social  Services,  Mental  and  Public  Health,  and  nu-
merous other clubs and organizations. This of course puts a strain on manpower and
limits the amount of time that can be devoted to other criminal activity.

In some cases, Tioga County has enlisted the help of the DEA in clearing the lab
site  of  chemicals  and  contaminates.  Unfortunately,  the  DEA  only  has  two  fully
trained  clandestine  lab  teams  to  cover  New  York,  making  it  extremely  difficult  to
acquire  their  assistance.  In  most  cases,  Tioga  County  enlists  the  assistance  of  the
New York State Police and county HAZMAT team to perform an initial assessment
of  the  lab  site  and  perform  evidence  collection  and  removal  of  lab  related  debris,
such as chemicals and containers. Further cleanup operations and expenses usually
fall on the plate of local government, at substantial expense.

To  further  complicate  the  problem  is  the  growing  trend  of  mobile  meth  labs.
Known  as  ‘‘box  labs,’’  producers  carry  their  cooking  operations  in  luggage  size  con-
tainers,  which  allow  them  to  cook  their  meth  in  cars,  motel  rooms,  or  in  isolated,
wooded areas in an effort to avoid detection. This methodology creates a greater op-
portunity for producers to dump the ‘‘sludge’’ and toxic waste in areas which would
increase the changes of exposure, or environmental contamination.

Clandestine methamphetamine labs present unique and very serious problems for
both  law  enforcement  and  public  health  officials.  Unlike  other  illicit  drug  activity,
the  impact  of  this  drug  can  be  far  reaching,  having  negative  effects  on  those  who
produce  it  or  use  it,  to  those  who  are  unknowingly  exposed  to  a  contaminated  resi-
dence,  waterway,  or  debris.  It  has  a  negative  impact  on  the  financial  resources  of
public  safety  and  public  health  agencies,  and  will  certainly  have  a  negative  impact
on the environment.

The creation of H.R. 798 will extend help to local governments in the fight against
the  manufacture  and  cleanup  of  meth.  The  environment  impact  of  the  production
of  meth  may  not  be  known  for  years  to  come.  The  residual  effects  of  the  leftover
chemicals  pose  a  hazard  to  home  owners  and  tenants  were  labs  were  once  located.
Having  standards  and  guidelines  as  outlined,  will  help  establish  a  protocol  that  in
the future will help in the cleanup of known meth sites and protect the public.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  How  is  that  for  an  expert  witness?  One

Dr. Bell.

STATEMENT OF DR. ROBERT R. BELL, PH.D., PRESIDENT,

TENNESSEE TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY

Dr. BELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member Gor-

don.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  a  prepared  statement,  which  I  would  re-

quest be entered into the record.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Without objection, so ordered.
All  full  statements  are  entered  into  the  record  for  the  benefit  of
our colleagues, who are not here. Incidentally, this is quite good at-
tendance, because of the interest in the subject.

Dr. BELL. Thank you.
Good  morning,  Members  of  the  Committee,  and  especially  Con-
gressman Davis, who is an alumnus of Tennessee Tech University.
It  is  an  honor  to  be  invited  to  testify  before  you  today  regarding
H.R.  798.  My  name  is  Bob  Bell,  and  I  serve  as  President  of  Ten-
nessee  Technological  University,  the  state’s  only  technological  uni-
versity, which is known for a strong reputation in engineering and
sciences.

The  area  Tennessee  Tech  serves  in  our  state  is  predominately
rural  and  has  been  dramatically  impacted  by  the  meth  problem.
While the leadership of Tennessee has been deeply involved in try-
ing  to  solve  this  problem,  we  need  the  focus  this  committee  pro-
vides on a national level. It is reassuring that you understand how
explosive this problem is and how much this is a threat to our way
of  life.  We  are  particularly  fortunate  in  Cookeville,  in  our  area,  to
be  represented  by  Congressman  Gordon,  who  has  made  the  fight
against meth a top priority for his public service.

Numbers  do  not  fully  illustrate  the  extent  of  the  problem,  par-
ticularly  in  rural  Tennessee.  They  do  not  describe  the  human  ele-
ment. But here are just some of the facts associated with this chal-
lenge. The labs that are used to make meth are often portable and
clandestine,  as  you  have  heard,  so  they  can  be  easily  created  and
hidden  in  rural  areas.  Labs  are  found  virtually  every  day  within
many  counties  in  the  State  of  Tennessee.  A  full  75  percent  of  the
meth labs seized in the southeast are in Tennessee. In 2004, there

were 1,259 lab incidents in Tennessee, the third highest in the Na-
tion. The Cumberland Plateau Tennessee Tech serves is now recog-
nized  as  the  richest  source  of  meth  in  the  state.  Last  year,  more
than  700  children  were  taken  into  State  custody  because  of  meth
arrests amounting to a cost of over $4 million to the state.

Last  year,  the  Tennessee  Governor  established  a  task  force  on
meth  abuse.  1/5  of  the  members  were  Tennessee  Tech  alumni.  As
a  result  of  that  group’s  finding,  he  has  presented  a  comprehensive
bill  addressing  this  issue.  Among  the  recommendations  are  limita-
tions  on  the  sale  of  cold  and  sinus  products  containing
pseudoephedrine.  That  measure  alone  previously  enacted  in  our
home  community  of  Cookeville,  Tennessee,  has  already  slowed  the
manufacture  of  meth,  although  it  can  not  address  the  importation
of the drug.

Our region has also benefited from the efforts of Representatives
Gordon  and  Davis  who  assist  local  meth  investigations  and  who
started a public education campaign with federal grants.

H.R.  798  provides  authorization  for  new  research  and  studies  to
be funded by federal agencies, such as EPA and NIST. In our view,
universities,  such  as  Tennessee  Tech,  have  an  important  role  to
play  in  supporting  and  carrying  out  that  research.  In  the  time
since the meth problem became apparent in Tennessee, our faculty
members  have  been  eager  to  join  the  battle  in  a  meaningful  way.
Research and service conducted so far include the following.

Using  street  methods,  Tennessee  Tech  chemistry  faculty  mem-
bers  have  demonstrated  that  pseudoephedrine  can  be  extracted
from  most  combination  products,  such  as  cold  medicines  that  com-
bine  the  substance  with  other  drugs,  with  a  50  to  70  percent  ex-
traction  ratio.  To  aid  law  enforcement  and  free  warrant  environ-
ments,  chemistry  professors  have  also  conducted  preliminary  re-
search on quick detection kits that were mentioned earlier. A Ten-
nessee  Tech  professor  is  also  gathering  psychological  data  on  chil-
dren  who  have  been  removed  from  homes  where  meth  was  abused
or  cooked  to  test  whether  exposure  to  meth  can  be  linked  to  cog-
nitive problems.

In  Tennessee  Tech’s  College  of  Business  Administration,  a  meth
education  tool  kit  has  been  developed  with  video  interviews  fea-
turing dozens of front-line meth specialists. This CD will be distrib-
uted to law enforcement and emergency service personnel, schools,
property owners, and others free of charge.

Much more can be done, though, and we suggest the following as

potential research areas.

In  manufacturing  process  research,  continue  the  work  to  dem-
onstrate extraction efficiencies. We propose that cooking individual
components needs to be done to better understand the product and
the  byproducts  associated  with  this  process,  and  we  need  to  exam-
ine the methods for chemical bonding that do not allow product de-
composition.

In  the  chemistry  of  detection,  we  propose  new  standards  at  the
national  level  for  detection  by  researching  the  external  environ-
ment  where  vapors  are  vented  and  outside  the  home  in  a  car  or
other facility being used as a mobile lab.

A  quick  detection  kit  will  help  generate  turnaround  times  less
than  one  day  on  crime  scene  data  simplifying  the  issuance  of  war-

rants. Long-term research should focus on mechanisms that quickly
detect  the  presence  of  hazardous  chemicals  in  a  rental  home,  a
motel  room,  a  college  residence  hall  much  the  same  way  that  a
smoke alarm detects the potential for fire.

A  technique  called  ‘‘lab  fingerprinting,’’  the  system  of  distin-
guishing among individual lots or batches of meth would allow law
enforcement to tie a crime scene involving meth abuse to the origi-
nal manufacturer of the drug. No two batches of meth are identical,
thus,  they  can  be  viewed  with  the  same  integrity  as  a  human  fin-
gerprint with the right research.

In  remediation,  we  need  to  address  more  efficient  methods  for
identifying  and  containing  lab  products  and  byproducts  with  a
rapid environmental kit. We simply don’t know how clean is clean.
Combining  biology  and  psychology.  We  must  better  understand
the physical and behavioral effects of a lab environment on victims
of  meth,  particularly  children,  in  order  to  devise  more  appropriate
methods of faster, more complete rehabilitation.

In  education  and  science,  we  can  expedite  the  spread  of  cur-
ricular  initiatives  and  research  findings  in  online  clearinghouses
addressing a glaring need for a more central source of information.
Mr.  Chairman,  it  is  not  a  university’s  place  to  go  out  into  the
streets  to  arrest  criminals  or  to  remove  children  from  their  homes
when  the  environment  is  unsafe  or  to  treat  the  addiction.  It  is  a
university’s  place  to  train  the  professionals  who  take  on  difficult
jobs on the front line of this battle. It is a university’s place to con-
duct  the  research  that  can  provide  the  tools  that  these  profes-
sionals need.

The  legislation  that  is  the  subject  of  today’s  hearing  takes  the
next  logical  steps  in  one  of  the  most  perplexing  elements  of  the
meth problem: detection and clean up of lab sites.

I  applaud  the  Committee’s  leadership  in  creating  this  bill  and
urge  its  prompt  adoption,  and  I  thank  you  for  your  time  and  for
this  opportunity  to  take  part  in  this  hearing.  I  will  be  pleased  to
answer questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT R. BELL

INTRODUCTION

Tennessee  Tech  is  the  state’s  only  technological  university,  with  a  strong  reputa-
tion in engineering and the sciences. A comprehensive university serving over 9,000
students,  TTU  retains  a  strong  commitment  to  excellence  in  undergraduate  edu-
cation, with majors in engineering, business administration, education, the arts and
sciences,  nursing,  agriculture,  and  human  ecology.  We  also  offer  a  wide  range  of
graduate  programs,  including  doctoral  degrees  in  many  fields  of  engineering,  envi-
ronmental sciences, and ‘‘exceptional learning’’ in education. TTU hosts three accom-
plished state Centers of Excellence in Energy Systems Research, Water Quality, and
Manufacturing  Research.  Last  year,  Tennessee  Tech  was  listed  by  U.S.  News  and
World Report as one of only 11 mid-sized universities in the ‘‘Best in the South’’ cat-
egory and in the top tier of the ‘‘Best Public and Private Colleges and Universities’’
in  the  South.  TTU  is  a  member  of  the  American  Association  of  State  Colleges  and
Universities.

While  TTU  is  a  public  university  serving  students  from  all  over  our  state,  many
other  states,  and  many  foreign  nations,  we  retain  a  special  mission-based  commit-
ment to serve the Upper Cumberland Region of Tennessee. The Upper Cumberland
Region,  containing  roughly  40  counties,  ranges  from  just  East  of  Nashville  to  just
West of Knoxville, and from the Kentucky border to just north of Chattanooga. The
region  TTU  serves  is  predominantly  rural  and  has  been  dramatically  impacted  by
the meth problem.

SIGNIFICANCE  OF  PROBLEM/RISE  IN  THE  NUMBER  OF  USERS  AND

LABS

54

Meth  was  first  introduced  as  an  illicit  drug  in  Tennessee  in  1978.  A  Tennessee
native,  who  had  been  imprisoned  in  California,  brought  the  knowledge  and  produc-
tion methods back to his home after he was released. Unfortunately, he also set up
a ‘‘school’’ to teach individuals how to ‘‘cook’’ meth for a fee.

District  Attorney  General  Bill  Gibson,  a  TTU  alumnus,  reported  that  the  Upper
Cumberland Region began seeing the impact of meth in the early 1990s with several
violent incidents that were difficult to explain. The consensus of the medical commu-
nity  and  law  enforcement  is  that  meth  is  the  most  addictive  and  dangerous  drug
seen in the Upper Cumberland area.

A  homemade  poisonous  cousin  of  pharmaceutically  based  amphetamine  or  speed,
meth  has  long  been  the  dominant  drug  problem  in  California.  It  is  an  evil  blend
of common household and farming products including anhydrous ammonia, acetone,
antifreeze,  and  the  active  ingredients  in  some  cold  medicines,  ephedrine  and
pseudoephedrine.  It  has  one  of  the  highest  addiction  rates  of  all  illegal  drugs,  in-
cluding crack cocaine, and one of the lowest recovery rates, about five percent.

Until the past decade, meth was a distant problem. It ravaged Pacific and North-
western states for a long time and more recently infected the Midwest. After moving
into Middle Tennessee, in the past 10 years in particular, it has flourished in small
labs  in  rural  communities  where  detection  is  difficult.  Today,  according  to  the  U.S.
Drug Enforcement Agency, a full 75 percent of all methamphetamine labs seized in
the Southeast are in Tennessee, growing from 135 labs in 1999 to 499 labs in 2003.
Last  year,  according  to  National  Clandestine  Laboratory  Database  numbers,  there
were  1,259  lab  incidents  in  Tennessee,  third  highest  in  the  Nation.  The  National
Drug  Intelligence  Center  considers  the  Cumberland  Plateau  the  richest  source  of
methamphetamine in the state.

Meth presents a unique danger to regions like Middle Tennessee. The laboratories
used to make the drug are often portable and/or clandestine, so they are easily cre-
ated.  According  to  the  Tennessee  Governor’s  Task  Force  on  Methamphetamine
Abuse,  labs  are  found  virtually  every  day  within  every  county  in  Tennessee.  That
makes  this  deadly  drug  as  available  in  the  farthest  reaches  of  rural  America  as  it
is in the big city streets.

Geographically,  Tennessee  is  unique  because  it  is  bordered  by  eight  other  states.
The  interstate  and  State  highway  systems  crisscross  Tennessee’s  four  major  cities
and traverse each of its borders. These highways, according to the Koch Crime Insti-
tute, carry a very large volume of traffic and are a primary means of moving drugs
to and through Tennessee. As a result, the drug situations in the neighboring states
have an impact on the drug situation in Tennessee.

The  availability  and  demand  for  meth  continues  to  increase  throughout  Ten-
nessee.  While  much  of  the  meth  consumed  in  the  state  is  transported  from  Mexico
and  the  Southwest  border  area,  clandestine  meth  labs  can  be  found  everywhere  in
Tennessee  and  are  encountered  daily  by  law  enforcement.  These  facts  are  a  stark
contrast  to  the  problem  of  a  few  years  ago.  The  labs  discovered  in  Tennessee  are
generally  characterized  as  small  and  unsophisticated.  These  clandestine  meth  labs
pose  a  significant  threat  because  lab  operators  are  frequently  armed  and  substan-
tially involved in the drug’s distribution.

Dozens  of  TTU  alumni,  as  well  as  faculty  members,  are  on  the  front  lines  in  the
battle against this deadly drug. They are professionals in law enforcement, the judi-
cial  system,  social  and  medical  services,  state  government  and  education.  In  the
past two years, these men and women have rallied in a concerted effort to wipe out
the worst drug threat to ever face our region.
PROBLEM  SCOPE:  HOW  IT  HAS  AFFECTED  TENNESSEE  AND  THE

UPPER CUMBERLAND

Currently,  Tennessee  is  third  in  the  Nation  in  meth  lab-related  incidents.  Meth
lab  arrests  have  more  than  tripled  since  1999.  It  is  estimated  that  more  than  700
children will be taken into State custody in 2005, at a cost of over $4 million to the
state.  The  production  process  leaves  behind  five  pounds  of  toxic  waste  product  for
every one pound of meth. Removal and handling of evidence and hazardous residue
can cost between $5,000 and $20,000 per site, according to the 13th Judicial District
Drug Task Force. Restoration of the site to safe, habitable conditions can cost addi-
tional  tens  of  thousands  of  dollars.  Businesses  suffer  from  escalated  costs  of  health
coverage,  lost  time  at  work,  workplace  injuries,  and  theft.  And  the  meth  users  and
their families suffer dramatic, even life-threatening health problems associated with
this substance abuse.

Dr.  Sullivan  Smith,  the  county  medical  examiner  and  another  TTU  alumnus,  de-
scribed meth as the most dangerous drug he has dealt with in his career and claims

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:10 Apr 25, 2005 Jkt 099573 PO 00000 Frm 00058 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\030305\99573 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

55

it  is  responsible  for  the  majority  of  violent  crime  in  Cookeville  in  the  past  three  or
four years. Dr. Smith, who is DEA-certified to enter and seize a meth lab, expresses
concern  for  the  children  meth  affects.  These  labs,  besides  being  toxic,  are  places
where  children  are  growing  up  in  the  midst  of  violence,  weapons,  and  prostitution.
Meth  also  has  a  profound  effect  on  our  school  systems.  Johnny  Cordell,  Upper
Cumberland  Representative  to  the  Tennessee  Organization  of  School  Superintend-
ents,  noted  that  in  his  county  (Sequatchie  County,  population  approximately
13,000), law enforcement locates and destroys one meth lab each week. Mike Prock,
Chairperson of the Upper Cumberland School Directors’ Study Council, emphasized
how  unrealistic  it  is  to  expect  children  to  come  to  school  ready  to  learn  when  their
family unit is being destroyed by meth addiction. Lana Sievers, Commissioner of the
Tennessee Department of Education, noted that meth is not an isolated problem. Al-
most  10  percent  of  Tennessee  students  in  the  K–12  system  report  having  tried
meth.  This  drug  is  being  used  and  produced  in  their  homes,  and  it  is  making  its
way into the schools.

In addition to the impact on school systems, meth abuse has terrible consequences
for  family  members,  especially  young  children.  Children  taken  from  active  clandes-
tine meth labs are stripped of all possessions. They are normally taken to an emer-
gency room at a hospital, where they are tested, frequently by needle. They are sep-
arated from adult family members, sometimes from other siblings, and cannot even
keep  a  favorite  teddy  bear  for  comfort.  TTU  alumnus  and  child  protective  services
case manager Betsy Dunn considers meth the worst form of child endangerment she
has ever seen. Children are neglected to the point where they are often the primary
caretakers of their siblings and their parents as well.

Meth  also  has  profound  effects  on  State  and  local  governments  and  support  re-
sources.  Often,  smaller  counties  in  Tennessee  simply  do  not  have  the  resources  to
address the meth problem and must call for outside assistance. In a typical raid on
a clandestine meth lab in a rural county where an arrest is made, at least four offi-
cers are needed. Current guidelines stipulate that a ‘‘partner’’ system must be used,
with  a  minimum  of  two  officers  in  the  residence/lab,  one  as  a  lead  and  one  as  a
backup. Because of time constraints associated with potential exposures to the toxic
environment, regulations also stipulate that a ‘‘rotation’’ team of two additional offi-
cers be outside the residence, ready to rescue those inside and ready to rotate after
the  first  team  reaches  a  specified  time  limit  in  the  facility.  Emergency  personnel
and/or  fire  personnel  are  also  required  on  scene  in  case  of  an  accident.  A  typical
cleanup  operation  may  take  from  eight  to  15  hours.  During  this  time,  local  county
resources are stretched to a breaking point, and County Sheriffs often must call for
support  from  other  agencies.  County  medical  providers  and  facilities  are  also  often
overwhelmed by spillovers from clandestine laboratory raids.
AGENCIES THAT CURRENTLY RESPOND TO RESIDENTIAL METH LABS/
HOW LABS ARE CURRENTLY ASSESSED, CLEANED AND REME-
DIATED/STATE  LAWS  AND  REGULATIONS  THAT  GUIDE  THIS
PROCESS

Local law enforcement agencies are often the first notified about a suspected clan-
destine meth lab. Typically, when a lab is identified, a team of responders is assem-
bled.  First  on  the  scene  may  be  local  law  enforcement  agencies  (city  police,  County
Sheriff’s office). Only individuals who are ‘‘Clandestine Lab Certified’’ may enter the
residence  or  clandestine  lab.  They  may  be  supplemented  by  agents  from  the  Drug
Task  Force,  Drug  Enforcement  Agency,  or  the  Tennessee  Bureau  of  Investigation.
Emergency  medical  services  personnel  are  also  called  for  stand-by  support.  Often,
other support is provided by local fire department personnel, the Tennessee Depart-
ment  of  Children’s  Services,  and  other  service  providers  such  as  the  Upper  Cum-
berland  Community  Services  Agency.  Certified  hazardous  materials  contractors  are
used  to  gather,  transport,  and  dispose  of  materials  in  the  meth  lab.  The  Office  of
the  District  Attorney  and,  frequently,  the  Public  Defender’s  Office  are  also  closely
involved.  As  the  site  is  catalogued  and  remediation  is  initiated,  officials  from  the
regional public health offices and environmental protection offices are also often in-
volved.

Protocols  that  guide  assessment  and  remediation  of  clandestine  methamphet-
amine labs are found in Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 68, as amended by Public
Acts  2004,  Chapter  855,  ‘‘Inspection,  Testing,  and  Quarantine  of  Property  Where
Methamphetamine  was  Manufactured,’’  and  by  ‘‘Emergency  Rules  of  the  Depart-
ment  of  Environment  and  Conservation-Standards  for  Testing  and  Cleaning  Clan-
destine  Drug  Manufacturing  Sites’’  (Chapter  1200,  1–19).  Also  appropriate  is  Ten-
nessee  Department  of  Environment  and  Conservation  Interim  Guidance,  February

tion  Guidance  for  Properties  Quarantined  due  to  Clandestine  Methamphetamine
Laboratory (CML) Activities Pursuant to TCA 68–212 Part 5.’’
LIMITATIONS OF ASSESSMENT/REMEDIATION STRATEGIES

While  current  assessment/remediation  strategies  are  clearly  more  refined  than
those  in  place  just  a  few  years  ago,  much  remains  to  be  done.  Entrance  guidelines
are  still  loose.  Individuals  entering  a  clandestine  meth  lab  are  in  effect  entering  a
working  hazardous  materials/chemistry  laboratory,  but  one  where  few  traditional
safety  measures  have  been  in  place.  There  are  no  fume  hoods  or  air  circulation
mechanisms.  There  has  been  no  routine  cleanup  protocol  in  place  for  spills.  While
the  presence  of  meth  is  presumed,  uncertainty  remains  about  the  levels  and  types
of  other  hazardous  gases,  fluids,  and  solids  in  the  lab  environment.  Science  related
to byproducts and the toxicity of the environment is still unclear.

Unfortunately,  a  baseline  definition  of  what  ‘‘clean’’  is,  in  terms  of  remediating
labs, is not available. Research at the university level is needed to develop that defi-
nition.  Fundamental  research  describing  what  ‘‘clean’’  really  is  must  happen  now.
A great deal of work remains to be done on the effects of exposure to the clandes-
tine  laboratory  in  children,  both  from  a  medical  and  a  psycho-social  context.  Re-
search  and  work  must  be  done  to  develop  more  effective  treatment/rehabilitation
programs  for  meth  users.  Little  evidence  exists  today  on  the  success  of  programs
specifically  addressing  the  impacts  of  meth  on  the  body  and  brain,  and  what  evi-
dence does exist gives little hope of remediation with current treatments. House Bill
798 will help take major steps in the right direction toward this effort. Universities
can play a major role as strategic partners in developing new detection and remedi-
ation strategies, helping develop standard reference materials and validation proto-
cols. Higher education can also play a role in identifying adverse biological risks on
the intervention teams, as well as studying the biological/medical and psycho-social
effects on children and others in the clandestine meth labs.
COLLABORATIONS  WITH  LOCAL  LAW  ENFORCEMENT  AND  THE  MED-

ICAL COMMUNITY

Tennessee Tech has collaborated with a number of state and regional agencies for
some  time.  Working  with  the  Office  of  the  Governor  and  the  13th  Judicial  District
Drug  Task  Force,  TTU  faculty  and  staff  participated  in  a  wide  range  of  activities
addressing  the  meth  problem;  the  university  has  been  identified  by  the  Drug  Task
Force as a ‘‘central resource’’ for the region.

TTU units involved in these efforts include the Department of Chemistry; Center
for  Structural  Chemistry;  the  Center  for  Management,  Utilization,  and  Protection
of  Water  Resources;  the  doctoral  program  in  environmental  sciences;  the  Business
Media  Center;  and  the  College  of  Education.  Key  individuals  involved  include  Dr.
Scott  Northrup,  Chair,  Department  of  Chemistry;  Dr.  Jeff  Boles,  Director,  Environ-
mental Sciences Ph.D. program; Dr. Eugene Kline, Professor of Chemistry; Dr. Mar-
tha  Wells,  Water  Center  Professor;  Dr.  Barbara  Jackson,  Professor  of  Chemistry;
Dr. Comfort Asanbe, Professor of Curriculum and Instruction; and Mr. Kevin Liska,
Director, Business Media Center. The university is eager to offer more.

TTU  research/service  agenda  can  be  generally  categorized  into  four  areas:  Manu-
facturing  Process  Research,  Education  and  Information,  Detection,  and  Remedi-
ation, described below.
Manufacturing  Process  Research:  Faculty  in  the  TTU  Chemistry  Department,
the doctoral program in environmental sciences, and the Water Center have recently
been involved in a project sponsored by the Governor’s Office and the 13th Judicial
District  Drug  Task  Force.  Using  ‘‘street’’  methods  and  solvents  for  extraction  cer-
tified by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, these studies demonstrated that 50
to 70 percent extraction efficiencies for pseudoephedrine can be achieved from most
combination  products  (such  as  cold  medicines  that  combine  pseudoephedrine  with
other  drugs)  typically  associated  as  viable  sources  for  the  compound  that  is  turned
into meth. TTU partnered with Dr. Sullivan Smith on these experiments. Charlotte
Burks, our state senator and a member of the Drug Task Force and Governor’s Task
Force  on  Methamphetamine  Abuse,  credited  our  research  in  this  area  for  helping
speed the development of the Governor’s new bill.
Education  and  Information:  Several  of  TTU’s  social  service  areas,  including  the
‘‘Make a Difference’’ project in the College of Education, regularly see the collateral
effects  of  meth  abuse  on  children.  TTU  enjoys  a  very  close  partnership  with  school
systems  throughout  the  Upper  Cumberland  Region  of  Tennessee  and  hosts  the  re-
gional  P–16  Council.  Faculty  and  staff  from  the  Colleges  of  Education,  Arts  and
Sciences, Engineering and Business Administration have all collaborated to help de-
velop educational programs addressing meth abuse. Some of these projects have in-

volved  curricular  initiatives,  with  the  intent  of  ‘‘embedding’’  anti-meth  messages  in
the  elementary  school  curriculum.  Early  work  was  done  in  Cumberland  County,
Tennessee, and is now being expanded into Putnam and Jackson Counties.

Business  Media  Center  Director  Kevin  Liska,  in  collaboration  with  the  Putnam
County Health Department and the 13th Judicial Drug Task Force, created a Meth
Education Tool Kit to be distributed to law enforcement, schools, emergency services
personnel,  property  owners  and  others—all  potential  victims  of  meth  manufacture
and  abuse.  In  the  form  of  a  CD–ROM,  the  kit  includes  interviews  with  front-line
meth  specialists  from  the  Tennessee  National  Guard,  the  Tennessee  Departments
of Children’s Services and Health, the U.S. EPA and Drug Enforcement Agency, and
local  social  services  and  medical  agencies.  The  CD  is  organized  into  22  community
target markets presenting video on meth facts, medical impact, testimonials, and fi-
nancial impact—all directed toward four age categories.
Detection:  TTU  Chemistry  Professor  Jeff  Boles  consults  with  the  Committee  on
bills  related  to  meth  and  has  been  studying  the  meth  problem  from  a  number  of
angles over the long term. Through the TTU Center for Structural Chemistry, which
he  administers,  he  proposes  a  two-part  attack,  the  first  of  which  is  detection  in  a
pre-warrant situation. While early work has been done on a quick-detection kit, col-
laboration with the NIST is necessary to identify existing standards of detection and
benchmark the actions by other states in order to develop new standards at the na-
tional level. The center proposes researching the external environment where vapors
are  vented  outside  a  home  or  car  being  used  as  a  mobile  lab.  Estimates  are  that
effective  lab  detection  technologies  will  someday  help  generate  a  turnaround  time
of one day on crime scene data that would simplify the issuance of warrants.
Remediation:  The  second  prong  in  Professor  Boles’  research  is  environmental
cleanup.  Toxic  byproducts  leave  meth  sites  highly  contaminated,  from  water  to  air
to  soil  to  the  structure  that  housed  the  clandestine  operation.  Research  is  needed
to make some form of remediation economically feasible. Rapid environmental anal-
ysis kits, with very short on-site cycle times, must be developed to identify hazards
associated with clandestine lab environments. More efficient methods for identifying
and  appropriately  containing  lab  products  and  byproducts  must  be  addressed.  Re-
search must yet be done on appropriate methods and materials for ‘‘cleaning’’ a lab
and  remediating  a  site.  Standards  must  be  developed  to  address  the  question  of
‘‘how clean is clean?’’ The potential for meaningful doctoral research in TTU’s envi-
ronmental  sciences  Ph.D.  program,  as  well  as  similar  programs  nationwide,  exists
for exactly these topics.

RESEARCH  GUIDANCE  NEEDED  TO  ADDRESS  THE  ENVIRONMENTAL

HAZARDS OF RESIDENTIAL METH LABS

The  scope  of  H.R.  798  provides  a  mechanism  for  making  major  progress  in  the
research and science associated with meth abuse. This is a long-term effort, and the
problem will not be solved in the next year or even the year after. But colleges and
universities  in  general,  and  TTU  in  particular,  want  to  be  involved  in  moving  to-
ward  a  solution.  Listed  below  are  some  specific  descriptions  of  how  TTU  is  already
involved and how it can help in the future, but other possibilities for significant re-
search can be generated through H.R. 798.
Manufacturing  Process  Research:  Significant  additional  work  is  needed  to  un-
derstand the process and science associated with the manufacture of meth. As men-
tioned  previously,  recent  work  at  TTU  (December  2004/January  2005)  has  dem-
onstrated  that  high  efficiencies  of  meth  production  can  be  achieved  with  over-the-
counter  products,  using  inexact  ‘‘street’’  methods  of  production.  This  work  needs  to
be  expanded  and  refined.  Work  needs  to  be  done  to  ‘‘cook’’  the  individual  compo-
nents to more fully understand all of the compounds produced (product and byprod-
ucts). This will lead to a better understanding of the hazards of each individual and
combination byproduct. Work should continue on decomposition research, examining
methods for chemical bonding that do not allow product decomposition.
The  Chemistry  of  Detection:  Much  work  remains  in  the  chemistry  of  detection.
Current  processes  are  slow  and  inefficient.  Cycle  times  for  analysis  are  long,  in  a
relative sense, and present problems for efficient law enforcement. More efficient de-
tection  and  diagnostic  tools  must  be  developed  so  that  sites  can  be  more  rapidly
identified and reaction times shortened. Long-term research should focus on mecha-
nisms  that  quickly  detect  the  presence  of  hazardous  chemicals  in  a  rental  home,  a
motel  room,  or  a  college  residence  hall,  much  the  same  as  a  smoke  alarm  detects
the  potential  for  fire.  Studies  should  continue  on  environmental  sampling,  with  a
focus  on  developing  a  detection  mechanism  for  sampling  air  surrounding  a  resi-
dence.

Lab Fingerprinting: Tennessee Tech has proposed research in developing methods
for  ‘‘fingerprinting’’  illegally  manufactured  meth  drugs  synthesized  in  a  clandestine
lab  contain  sufficient  impurities  allowing  such  identification  since  these  labs  are
generally  poorly  operated.  No  two  batches  or  lots  of  meth  will  be  identical;  thus,
they  can  be  viewed  with  the  same  integrity  as  a  human  fingerprint.  Such
fingerprinting  would  allow  law  enforcement  agencies  to  reach  back  into  the  manu-
facturing process, more clearly identifying specific products used.
Remediation: Research must continue on the processes implemented after labs are
discovered.  Rapid  environmental  analysis  kits,  with  very  short  on-site  cycle  times,
must be developed to identify hazards associated with clandestine lab environments.
More efficient methods for identifying and appropriately containing lab products and
byproducts  must  be  addressed.  Research  must  yet  be  done  on  appropriate  methods
and materials for ‘‘cleaning’’ a lab and remediating a site. Standards must be devel-
oped to address the question of ‘‘how clean is clean?’’
Biology/Psychology: Significant additional work must be conducted on the biologi-
cal  and  psychological  sciences  associated  with  meth  production  and  abuse.  Much
new  work  on  the  effects  of  the  lab  environment  on  children  must  be  undertaken,
focusing on both the biological and psycho-social impacts of the environment. Many
physicians believe that current treatment paradigms for meth abusers are highly in-
effective,  and  much  work  remains  to  be  done  on  appropriate  methods  for  faster,
more  complete  rehabilitation.  In  the  TTU  Department  of  Counseling  and  Psy-
chology,  Assistant  Professor  Comfort  Asanbe,  a  licensed  psychologist,  gathers  psy-
chological  data  on  children  who  have  been  removed  from  homes  where  meth  was
abused  or  cooked.  Exposure  to  meth  could  be  linked  to  cognitive  problems,  and  the
environment is hazardous.
Education and Science: Work also needs to continue on the interaction of science
and education to appropriately demonstrate the science associated with meth to dif-
ferent  age  groups  in  order  to  clearly  identify  the  medical  and  social  toxicity  of  the
drug. While this is not the focus of H.R. 798, it clearly is a related, vital component
of  addressing  the  problem  and  eventually  eliminating  many  of  the  hazards  associ-
ated with the clandestine production of the drug. There is also a need for more pub-
lic  education  and  community  awareness  and  training  modules  for  delivery  on  the
Internet, providing more scientific content.

The ripple effect of a drug like meth makes it dangerous; it is not simply a matter
of  one  person’s  addiction,  it  is  the  peripheral  effects  that  add  up  to  a  significant
threat  to  society.  The  motivation  for  attacking  the  problem  head-on  is  strong.  The
effects  of  meth  in  the  local  communities  surround  Tennessee  Tech,  a  regional  uni-
versity  located  in  a  rural  area.  The  labs  affect  and  contaminate  the  environment.
Production and use have a devastating effect on the children TTU hopes to eventu-
ally serve.

As  indicated  earlier,  alumni  of  institutions  just  like  Tennessee  Tech  are  leading
this fight. The war can only be won if it is attacked on all sides by all constituents.
Smaller universities play a critical role; they can address this lethal epidemic. They
provide  the  expertise  in  qualified  and  interested  faculty  members  who  want  to  do
this  type  of  research.  They  have  an  inherent  motive  to  address  the  quality  of  stu-
dents served in local communities.
RECOMMENDATIONS/RESPONSE TO H.R. 798

Much  more  can  be  done,  however,  to  address  the  problem,  not  only  at  home,  but
across  the  country.  Because  of  this  bill,  faculty  at  regional  universities  like  Ten-
nessee  Tech  can  make  use  of  their  expertise,  engaging  in  the  level  of  research  re-
quired  to  find  real  solutions  to  the  problem.  In  summary,  Tennessee  Tech  faculty
members propose expanding research in the following areas:

• In  manufacturing  process  research,  continuing  our  work  in  dem-
onstrating  extraction  efficiencies,  we  propose  ‘‘cooking’’  the  individual  compo-
nents  to  more  fully  understand  both  product  and  byproduct,  and  we  need  to
examine  methods  for  chemical  bonding  that  do  not  allow  product  decomposi-
tion.

• In the chemistry of detection, we propose developing new standards at the
national  level  for  detection  by  researching  the  external  environment  where
vapors are vented outside a home or car being used as a mobile lab. A quick-
detection kit will help generate a turnaround time of one day on crime scene
data,  simplifying  the  issuance  of  warrants.  Long-term  research  should  focus
on  mechanisms  that  quickly  detect  the  presence  of  hazardous  chemicals  in  a

rental  home,  a  motel  room,  or  a  college  residence  hall,  much  the  same  as  a
smoke alarm detects the potential for fire.

• A technique called lab fingerprinting—a system of distinguishing among
individual  lots  or  batches  of  meth—would  allow  law  enforcement  to  tie  a
crime involving meth abuse to the original manufacturer of the drug. No two
batches  of  meth  are  identical;  thus,  they  can  be  viewed  with  the  same  integ-
rity as a human fingerprint.

• In  remediation,  we  can  address  more  efficient  methods  for  identifying  and
containing  lab  products  and  byproducts  with  a  rapid  environmental  analysis
kit,  and  we  simply  must  address  the  question  of  ‘‘how  clean  is  clean?’’  in  re-
mediation efforts.

• Combining biology with psychology, we must better understand the phys-
ical  and  behavioral  effects  of  a  lab  environment  on  victims  of  meth,  particu-
larly  children,  in  order  to  devise  more  appropriate  methods  for  faster,  more
complete rehabilitation.

• In  education  and  science,  we  can  expedite  the  spread  of  curricular  initia-
tives  and  research  findings  in  an  online  clearinghouse,  thus  addressing  a
glaring need for such a central source of information.

It  is  not  a  university’s  place  to  go  out  into  the  streets  to  arrest  criminals,  or  to
remove  children  from  their  homes  when  the  environment  is  unsafe,  or  to  treat  an
abuser’s  addiction.  It  is  a  university’s  place  to  train  the  professionals  who  take  on
the  difficult  jobs  on  the  front  line  of  the  meth  battle.  It  is  a  university’s  place  to
conduct  research  that  can  provide  the  tools  these  professionals  need  to  make  a  dif-
ference.

With the appropriate funding for equipment and other resources, colleges and uni-
versities  like  Tennessee  Tech  stand  ready  to  do  their  part  in  implementing  H.R.
798,  and  the  results  of  our  research  can  be  applied  wherever  meth  is  a  problem.
The Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2005 attacks the problem from
arguably the most important angle. It takes the next logical step in one of the most
perplexing  and  complicated  elements  of  the  meth  problem—detection  and  cleanup
of  meth  manufacturing  sites.  The  Committee’s  leadership  in  creating  this  bill  is  to
be  applauded,  and  TTU  offers  its  wholehearted  support  in  every  level  of  this  re-
search. TTU can be a full partner in the bill’s proposed research program on detec-
tion, remediation, and residual health effects on children.

GOVERNOR PHIL BREDESEN’S ‘‘METH FREE

TENNESSEE’’ BILL

On February 24, 2005, Governor Phil Bredesen outlined the major components of
comprehensive  legislation  to  address  methamphetamine  manufacturing  and  abuse
in Tennessee, and took another step toward raising public awareness by proclaiming
March as ‘‘Meth-Free Tennessee Month.’’

Major  provisions  of  the  bill  (attached  as  an  appendix  to  this  testimony)  include:
• Limitations  on  the  sale  of  cold  and  sinus  products  containing  the  deconges-
tant  pseudoephedrine,  the  vital  ingredient  in  the  manufacture  of  meth-
amphetamine.  While  many  pseudoephedrine  products  will  go  behind  the
counter  in  licensed  pharmacies,  liquids  and  gel  caps  will  be  exempt  from  re-
strictions because they currently are not deemed viable in the meth manufac-
turing process.

• Closure of the so-called ‘‘personal-use loophole’’ in criminal law, which allows
meth  cooks  to  secure  lighter  penalties  by  claiming  they  manufactured  the
drug only for personal use.

• Requirement for health professionals to report meth lab-related burns and in-
juries  to  local  law  enforcement,  similar  to  the  existing  requirement  to  report
gunshot and knife wounds.

• Creation  of  an  online  registry  within  the  Department  of  Environment  and
Conservation listing properties quarantined by law enforcement due to meth-
lab  contamination.  A  separate  registry  will  be  created  within  the  Tennessee
Bureau  of  Investigation  listing  the  names  and  offenses  of  convicted  meth
cooks.

Separate  from  the  legislation,  the  Governor’s  FY05–06  budget  includes  nearly  $7
million  to  attack  the  meth  problem  in  Tennessee.  Among  other  items,  the  budget
includes:

• $2.4  million  for  increased  criminal  penalties  for  meth-related  crimes,  includ-

ing closure of the personal-use loophole.

• $1.7 million to launch a drug court pilot project endorsed by the White House
Office  of  National  Drug  Control  Policy  to  test  the  effectiveness  of  a  combina-
tion of treatment and light incarceration.

• $1.5 million to launch a statewide education and public awareness campaign.
• $600,000 to provide meth-lab response training to law enforcement and other

first responders.

SUMMARY OF SB2318, HB2334
SECTION 1: Designates legislation as the ‘‘Meth-Free Tennessee Act of 2005.’’
SECTION  2(a):  Requires  that  any  product  containing  an  ‘‘immediate  methamphet-
amine  precursor’’  must  be  sold  only  by  licensed  pharmacies.  (‘‘Immediate  meth-
amphetamine precursor is defined by Section 9.)
SECTION 2(b): Exempts products that cannot be used to manufacture methamphet-
amine.  Requires  the  Department  of  Health,  in  consultation  with  the  TBI,  to  deter-
mine  whether  a  product  can  be  used  to  manufacture  methamphetamine.  Requires
the  Department  of  Health  to  maintain  a  list  of  exempt  products.  The  initial  list
shall include liquid preparations and gel capsules.
SECTION  2(c):  Prohibits  the  sale  of  more  than  three  packages  of  a  non-exempt
product or nine grams of pseudoephedrine to the same person over a 30-day period,
unless that person has a physician’s prescription.
SECTION  2(d):  Mandates  that  only  a  pharmacist,  or  pharmacy  technician  or  phar-
macy  intern  working  under  the  supervision  of  a  pharmacist,  can  sell  a  non-exempt
product.  Requires  purchaser  to  present  ID.  Requires  pharmacies  to  maintain  an
electronic record of the sale in the form of a pharmacist prescription order or a writ-
ten log.
SECTION 2(e): Requires that non-exempt products must be placed behind the phar-
macy counter.

SECTION  2(f):  Makes  it  a  Class  A  misdemeanor,  punishable  by  fine  only,  for  a
pharmacy  owner  or  operator  to  violate  this  section.  Requires  violations  to  be  re-
ported to the Board of Pharmacy for review and appropriate action.
SECTION  3:  Requires  the  Department  of  Health,  in  coordination  with  the  Depart-
ment  of  Education,  to  educate  and  raise  public  awareness  of  the  dangers  of  meth-
amphetamine  manufacturing  and  abuse  and  to  direct  addicts  to  treatment  re-
sources.
SECTION  4:  Requires  health  professionals  to  report  methamphetamine  laboratory-
related burns and injuries to local law enforcement, similar to the existing require-
ment to report gun and knife wounds.
SECTION  5.  Requires  the  Department  of  Environment  and  Conservation  to  main-
tain  lists  of  individuals  and  businesses  qualified  to  test  and  clean  properties  con-
taminated by methamphetamine manufacturing.
SECTION 6. Clarifies that the purpose of the existing provision to quarantine prop-
erties in which methamphetamine manufacturing has occurred is to prevent persons
from being exposed to the hazards associated with manufacturing.
SECTION 7. Makes it a Class B misdemeanor to offer for rent or to live in property
that has been quarantined, or to remove signs or notices of quarantine.
SECTION 8(a)-(b). Requires law enforcement to inform the Department of Environ-
ment and Conservation of a quarantine within seven days of issuing the quarantine
order.  Requires  the  Department  to  maintain  an  online  registry  listing  properties
that have been quarantined for at least 60 days, and to remove properties after the
quarantine is lifted.
SECTION  9.  Defines  ‘‘immediate  methamphetamine  precursor’’  as  ephedrine,
pseudoephedrine  or  phenylpropanolamine  or  any  products  containing  detectable
quantities of those substances.
SECTION  10(a)-(f).  Makes  it  a  Class  B  felony  for  any  person  to  initiate  a  process
intended to result in the manufacture of methamphetamine.
SECTION 11(a)-(f). Makes it a Class D felony for any person to promote the manu-
facture  of  methamphetamine.  Defines  promoting  as:  Purchasing  or  possessing  more
than nine grams of an immediate methamphetamine precursor with intent to manu-
facture; delivering more than nine grams to another person who intends to manufac-
ture;  or  selling  or  acquiring  any  substance  or  apparatus  intended  for  use  in  the
manufacturing process.
SECTION  12.  Deletes  TCA  39–17–434,  which  addresses  possession  of  substances
with  intent  to  manufacture  or  with  intent  to  convey  to  another  person  (now  dealt
with in Sections 10 and 11).
SECTION  13(a)-(f).  Establishes  within  the  TBI  a  registry  of  persons  convicted  of
manufacturing methamphetamine. Requires court clerks, beginning September 1, to
forward  copies  of  judgments  against  persons  convicted  of  manufacturing  meth-
amphetamine. Requires the Department of Correction to forward a list of those cur-
rently incarcerated for manufacturing methamphetamine.
SECTION 14. Makes it a Class A misdemeanor to attempt to use fraudulent means
to pass a drug test.
SECTION  15.  Removes  the  ‘‘personal  use  loophole’’  from  current  law.  (Under  exist-
ing  law,  methamphetamine  cooks  can  secure  a  lighter  criminal  penalty  by  claiming
they were manufacturing only for personal use.)
SECTION  16.  Clarifies  that  if  any  provision  of  the  act  is  held  invalid  by  a  court,
then the other provisions will remain in force.
SECTION  17.  States  that  the  act  shall  take  effect  immediately,  the  public  welfare
requiring it.

HOUSE BILL 2334

By McMillan

SENATE BILL 2318

By Kyle

AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated,

Titles 39 and 68, relative to

methamphetamine.

WHEREAS, the Tennessee General Assembly recognizes that the clandestine manu-
facture  of  the  illegal  drug  methamphetamine  is  a  clear  and  present  danger  to  the
health and well being of the State of Tennessee; and
WHEREAS, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (‘‘DEA’’) has found
the availability and demand for methamphetamine continues to increase throughout
Tennessee; and
WHEREAS,  methamphetamine  is  commonly  manufactured  in  clandestine  labora-
tories  that  can  be  found  across  in  Tennessee  and  are  encountered  daily  by  federal,
State and local law enforcement; and
WHEREAS, the DEA estimates Tennessee now accounts for 75 percent of the meth-
amphetamine lab seizures in the Southeast; and
WHEREAS,  these  clandestine  methamphetamine  labs  pose  a  significant  threat  be-
cause  lab  operators  are  frequently  armed  and  are  often  directly  involved  in  the
drug’s distribution; and
WHEREAS, the problem of methamphetamine manufacturing and abuse is particu-
larly destructive to the children in our state and more than 700 children are enter-
ing  state  custody  each  year  as  a  result  of  methamphetamine  lab  seizures  and  re-
lated incidents; and
WHEREAS,  clandestine  methamphetamine  labs  also  pose  a  potentially  lethal  envi-
ronmental  hazard  due  to  the  unregulated  and  illegal  use  of  harmful  chemicals  in-
volved in the production of methamphetamine; and
WHEREAS, the hazardous materials generated during the clandestine manufacture
of methamphetamine impose a significant burden on property owners; and
WHEREAS,  there  is  anticipation  of  an  increase  in  methamphetamine  use  in  Ten-
nessee as the drug gains popularity over other abused drugs; and
WHEREAS, this Body desires to work with law enforcement, the health care indus-
try, community agencies and other interested stakeholders to develop a comprehen-
sive strategy including treatment and public awareness for addressing methamphet-
amine abuse; now, therefore,
BE  IT  ENACTED  BY  THE  GENERAL  ASSEMBLY  OF  THE  STATE  OF  TEN-
NESSEE:
SECTION 1. This Act shall be known and may be cited as the Meth-Free Tennessee
Act of 2005.
SECTION 2. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 39–17–431, is amended by deleting
the existing language in its entirety and substituting instead the following:
§ 39–17–431.  (a)  Except  as  provided  in  this  section,  any  product  that  contains  any
immediate  methamphetamine  precursor  may  be  dispensed  only  by  a  licensed  phar-
macy.
(b)(1)  A  product  that  contains  any  immediate  methamphetamine  precursor  shall  be
exempt  from  the  requirements  of  this  section  if  the  ingredients  of  the  product  are
not in a form that can be used in the manufacture of methamphetamine.
(2) The department of health, in consultation with the bureau of investigation, shall
determine  whether  a  product  that  contains  any  immediate  methamphetamine  pre-
cursor  is  not  in  a  form  that  can  be  used  in  the  manufacture  of  methamphetamine.

In making such a determination, the department and the bureau shall develop pro-
cedures that consider, among other factors,
(A)  ease  with  which  the  product  can  be  converted  to  methamphetamine,  including
the  presence  or  absence  of  a  ‘‘molecular  lock’’  completely  preventing  the  product’s
use in methamphetamine manufacture;
(B)  ease  with  which  pseudoephedrine  can  be  extracted  from  the  substance  and
whether it forms a salt, emulsion, or other form:
(C)  any  other  pertinent  data  that  can  be  used  to  determine  the  risk  of  the  product
being viable in the illegal manufacture of methamphetamine.
(3) The department of health shall maintain a public list of such exempted products.
Any  person  may  request  that  a  product  be  included  on  the  exemption  list.  Such  a
list  shall  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  products  in  the  form  of  gel  capsules  and
liquid  preparations  that  contain  any  immediate  methamphetamine  precursor.  The
term ‘‘gel capsule’’ means any soft gelatin liquid-filled capsule that contains a liquid
suspension, which, in the case of pseudoephedrine, is suspended in a matrix of glyc-
erin,  polyethelyne  glycol,  and  propylene  glycol,  along  with  other  liquid  substances.
Regardless  of  the  product  manufacturer’s  labeling,  a  gelatin-covered  solid  does  not
constitute a ‘‘gel capsule’’ under this provision.
(c)  A  pharmacy  shall  not  sell  to  the  same  person  more  than  three  individual  pack-
ages  of  any  non-exempt  product  containing  any  immediate  methamphetamine  pre-
cursor, nor shall a pharmacy sell to the same person any combination of such prod-
ucts containing more than nine grams of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or their salts,
isomers,  or  salts  of  isomers,  during  the  same  30-day  period.  The  nine-gram  limit
shall  apply  to  the  total  amount  of  base  ephedrine  and  pseudoephedrine  contained
in  the  products,  and  not  the  overall  weight  of  the  products.  The  prohibition  con-
tained  in  this  subsection  shall  not  apply  to  a  person  who  obtains  the  product  or
products  pursuant  to  a  valid  prescription  issued  by  a  licensed  physician,  certified
physician  assistant,  or  nurse  authorized  pursuant  to  Tennessee  Code  Annotated,
Section  63–6–204,  who  is  rendering  service  under  the  supervision,  control  and  re-
sponsibility  of  a  licensed  physician  and  who  meets  the  requirements  pursuant  to
Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 63–7–207(13).
(d)  The  pharmacist,  or  any  pharmacy  technician  or  pharmacy  intern  under  the  su-
pervision of the pharmacist, shall require any person purchasing a non-exempt prod-
uct  that  contains  any  immediate  methamphetamine  precursor  to  present  valid  gov-
ernment-issued identification at the point of sale. The pharmacist, pharmacy techni-
cian  or  pharmacy  intern  shall  maintain  an  electronic  record  of  the  sale  under  this
subsection in the form of a pharmacist prescription order as provided by Tennessee
Code Annotated, Section 63–10–206(c). The electronic record shall include the name
of  purchaser,  name  and  quantity  of  product  purchased,  date  purchased,  purchaser
identification  type  and  number  (such  as  driver  license  state  and  number),  and  the
identity (such as name, initials, or identification code) of the dispensing pharmacist,
pharmacy technician or pharmacy intern. If a system is not able to record the iden-
tification  type  and  number,  the  pharmacist,  pharmacy  technician  or  pharmacy  in-
tern  shall  write  the  identification  type  and  number  on  the  prescription  order.  The
electronic  record  also  shall  be  maintained  in  such  a  manner  that  allows  for  the  de-
termination  of  the  equivalent  number  of  packages  purchased  and  total  quantity  of
base  ephedrine  or  pseudoephedrine  purchased.  In  lieu  of  maintaining  an  electronic
record,  a  pharmacy  may  maintain  a  written  register  containing  the  name  of  pur-
chaser, name of product purchased, date purchased, number of packages purchased,
total  quantity  of  base  ephedrine  or  pseudoephedrine  purchased,  purchaser  identi-
fication type and number (such as driver license state and number), purchaser’s sig-
nature  and  name  or  initials  of  the  pharmacist,  pharmacy  technician  or  pharmacy
intern  completing  the  transaction.  The  obligation  of  meeting  the  requirements  of
this section rests with the pharmacist.
(e)  Non-exempt  products  containing  an  immediate  methamphetamine  precursor
shall be maintained behind the counter of the pharmacy.
(f) A violation of any provision of this section is a Class A misdemeanor, punishable
by  fine  only.  If  the  person  in  violation  is  a  licensed  pharmacy  or  pharmacist,  such
violation shall be reported to the Board of Pharmacy for review and appropriate ac-
tion.  If  a  product  is  dispensed  in  violation  of  subsection  (a),  the  owner  or  operator
of the wholesale or retail establishment dispensing such product shall be in violation
of subsection (a).

ists.  Such  persons  will  test  properties  in  which  a  process  intended  to  result  in  the
manufacture of methamphetamine has occurred, as defined by Section 10 of this act,
to  determine  if  a  property  is  safe  for  human  use.  Such  property  may  include,  but
is  not  limited  to,  leased  or  rented  property  such  as  a  hotel  or  motel  room,  rented

DISCUSSION

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Dr. Bell. And I was
glad  to  see  you  agree  with  Ms.  Green,  who  said  there  is  too  little
research,  and  that  is  what  the  focus  of  this  bill  is  all  about.  We
could  argue  persuasively,  and  Mr.  Gordon  and  I  would  agree  on
this,  it  is  no  difference  whether  he  is  Democrat  or  Republican,  on
the need to provide adequate support to our law enforcement across
the country, but that is another committee’s jurisdiction.

You are right in emphasizing there is too little research, and Dr.
Martyny,  you  pointed  out,  there  is  a  lot  we  don’t  know.  And  I
would  add  to  that,  and  there  is  a  lot  that  we  don’t  know  about
what we don’t know. And so given that, I would ask you to respond
to  the  question:  where  do  you  think  we  should  concentrate  the  re-
search on the resources being provided under the provisions of this
bill?

And Ms. Green, I will ask you to come first.
Ms.  GREEN.  At  this  particular  time,  I  would  say,  from  the  per-
spective  of  drafting  laws  and  regulations  that  are  helpful,  State
and  locals,  really  on  health  effects,  short-  and  long-term,  in  terms
of children and adults and their exposure to the chemicals in order
to  have  that  research  for  a  health-based  standard.  This  is  an  area
in particular where the research, in terms of drafting, really needs
to drive the content of the particular laws and regulations. And ev-

erything  really  centers  around  the  research,  which  will  allow  the
determination  of  appropriate  clean  up  and  remediation  standards.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Dr. Martyny.
Dr.  MARTYNY.  I  believe  that,  you  know,  we  have  got  a  fair
amount  of  work  looking  at  exposure  to  law  enforcement  officers
coming  into  a  lot  of  these  situations.  We  have  a  pretty  good  idea
on  that.  We  have  no  idea  what  happens  after  the  lab—the  cook  is
actually done, what the exposures look like, how long do they last.
This  is  exceptionally  important  because  of  children  and  things
brought  into  these  facilities.  We  know  that  every  child  that  is
taken  out  of  these  labs  tests  positive  for  methamphetamine.  That
essentially means that there are exposures that go on long past the
lab  itself.  We  have  even  had  people  moving  into  the  labs  six
months  later  that  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  cooking  or  anything
like  that  where  we  have  had  pulmonary  fibrosis,  asthma,  and
things like this in these individuals, and so we need to know what
is  happening,  why  this  is  happening.  Is  it  because  of  the  meth-
amphetamine?  Is  it  because  of  other  chemicals  that  are  following
along with the meth? Meth is easy to test for. Some of these other
chemicals  aren’t.  So  we  need  better  testing  methods.  We  need  to
follow  it  over  a  long-term  period  of  time.  And  I  agree  with  Ms.
Green that we need to have the toxicologists involved to see where
these levels meet. We need to look at exposures and then find out,
well,  do  those  exposures  mean  that  these  will  be  the  symptoms
that  we  would  expect  to  see  in  these  kids.  And  how  do  we  follow
these kids and help them do better after they are removed from the
exposure?  We  know  very  little  about  that.  So  that  is  the  areas
I——

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Dr. Bell, did you wish to comment on that?
Dr.  BELL.  I  agree  with  Ms.  Green  and  Dr.  Martyny.  It  seems  to
me  that  we  need  significantly  more  work  on  health  effects,  espe-
cially  on  children  and  others  who  are  affected  by  the  lab.  And  we
also  need  a  lot  of  work  on  byproducts.  The  pseudoephedrine  and
the  product  itself,  the  methamphetamine,  we  can  identify,  but  we
simply  don’t  know  what  is  there,  both  in  the  immediate  lab  envi-
ronment, but also outside in the soil, in the site itself, in the trash
dumps that are behind the home or behind the trailer in which this
is being made.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Dr.  Bell  and  Ms.  Green  and  Dr.  Martyny,
is  it  fair  to  assume—you  know  the  danger  of  assuming,  but  is  it
fair  to  assume  that  all  of  you  applaud  the  initiative  from  the
Science Committee in terms of putting more emphasis on research,
because  that  adds—there  are  many  dimensions  to  this  problem.  It
is  so  much  more  than  just  law  enforcement.  And  as  the  Sheriff
pointed  out  to  me  when  I  visited  with  him  and  had  an  extensive
introduction from him on the overall problem, he showed me photo-
graph  after  photograph  where  they  made  drug  busts  where  there
are kids’ toys and slides and things like that just outside or inside
pointed  out  to  me  that  oftentimes  they  will  cook  the  substance  in
the  children’s  room,  because  they  don’t  think  the  law  enforcement
will look in the children’s room.

And  so  I  am  so  pleased,  I  hope  all  of  you  are,  to  see  the  large
attendance  on  the  part  of  the  media,  because  part  of  the  problem

is  heightening  public  awareness  of  the  issue.  And  another  dimen-
sion  to  the  problem  I  think  that  is  very  important  is  to  protect
those  that  we  call  upon  to  protect  us  every  single  day.  So  Sheriff,
you have had a number of successful busts, I know that, and a lot
of  coverage.  And  the  Sheriff  related  the  story  to  me  how  he  got  a
call  from  a  reporter  from  the  West  Coast  who  was  surfing  the
Internet  and  came  across  the  outstanding  record  of  Tioga  County
and contacted him about the record.

But  let  me  ask  you,  when  you  first  started  all  of  this,  when  you
started sending your teams in, what measure of protection did you
provide for your team going in to lessen the exposure?

Mr.  HOWARD.  Well,  I  have  to  say,  in  the  beginning,  we  were  a
little  bit  uneducated.  We  learned  very  quickly,  though,  once  you
enter  into  a  meth  lab,  you  have  got  some  serious  problems  to  con-
tend with. At this point, we have a 12-man entry team, as they are
called. They are HAZMAT trained. They wear protective gear when
we  take  a  lab  down.  Their  job  is  to  go  in,  secure  the  residence  or
the building, and take any suspects that they have out of the build-
ing.  Normally,  the  suspects  are  usually  left  in  place.  In  meth  lab
situations when we do a raid, we go in, we secure the building, we
take  everybody  out  of  the  building,  and  then  we  send  in  a  full
HAZMAT  team  to  decontaminate  the  building  and  take  a  look  to
see  what  they  have,  collect  evidence,  see  what  chemicals  are  out.
Once they do that, they try to do the best ventilation that they can
by  opening  all  of  the  doors,  windows,  and  getting  some  fresh  air
into  the  residence  before  any  other  law  enforcement  personnel
enter.  And  we  don’t  normally  enter  until  we  get  an  okay  from  the
HAZMAT team.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much.  And  my  time  has
expired  unfortunately,  because  I  have  got  a  jillion  other  questions.

Mr. Gordon.
Mr. GORDON. Dr. Bell, following up on the Chairman’s questions,
does  Tennessee  Tech  have  any  preliminary  direct  or  indirect  find-
ings about the physical and behavioral effects of methamphetamine
on children and first responders?

Mr.  BELL.  Congressman  Gordon,  we  do  have  some  findings,  and
I  would  be  happy  to  provide  those  for  the  record.  The  results  are
very  preliminary  and  very  small  samples  at  this  point.  One  of  the
issues  is  how  do  we  broaden  this  to  more  than  one  county  school
system  and  to—within  that  just  a  very  small  sample.  So  the—I
would not claim to have a scientific analysis at this point, but sim-
ply preliminary findings.

Mr.  GORDON.  And  Dr.  Martyny,  we  have  talked  about  the  envi-
ronmental  contamination  of  methamphetamine,  but  what  about
outside the residence? And you know, do we know anything about,
you  know,  how  broad  that  contamination  can  be?  For  example,  do
we have a good understanding of the possible contamination of sep-
tic tanks or water systems, things of this nature?

Dr.  MARTYNY.  You  know,  I  am  not  aware  of  any  studies  that
have actually been done, however, we have had some real tough in-
cidents,  especially  in  Colorado,  that  I  am  aware  of,  of  not  nec-
essarily  the  cook  itself  coming  out  the  windows,  you  know,  but
what we have had is—one of the things they do during these cooks
is  they  take  and  use  what  we  call  a  ‘‘death  bag.’’  It  is  a  bag  that

has  kitty  litter  in  it  that  you  essentially  pipe  the  effluence  into  it
and then, you know, that hopefully gets a lot of the toxic materials
in  there.  We  had  a  CDOT  employee,  Colorado  Department  of
Transportation  employee,  that  actually—that  went  into  a  roadside
arrest  and  was  opening—dumping  the  materials  there,  and  here
were  the—there  was  a  ‘‘death  bag’’  and  the  chemicals  in  there,  he
ended  up  having  to  go  to  the  hospital  from  exposure  essentially
from  the—you  know,  the  people  didn’t  want  to  keep  it  there,  so
they  just  took  and  dumped  it,  not  in  their  own  trash,  but  out  at
these  rest  stops  and  things  like  that.  And  we  are  seeing  this  hap-
pen  more  and  more.  We  are  seeing  a  lot  of  the  effluence  dumped
on  bike  trails,  on  hiking  trails  all  throughout  Colorado,  because
that way if you had been traced back, our enforcement has a hard-
er  time  tracing  it  back  to  people.  So  it  is  very  far-reaching.  It  is
more  than  you  think.  It  is  not  just  the  septic  tank,  not  just  the
sewers,  but  people  just  strewing  a  lot  of  the  chemicals  throughout
the  area,  trying  to  make  it  so  it  can’t  be  traced  back  to  them.  So
it does reach very far out.

Mr. GORDON. And when you are saying ‘‘tracing back,’’ I—it was
interesting  in  some  of  the  earlier  testimony  that  it  is  unique  and
it  is  almost  like  a  fingerprint,  and  so  that  if  you  were  to  find  this
bag  somewhere  else  or  if  you—if  there  was  a  7-Eleven  that  was
held up and you could swipe some type of residue, then would that
match up with the original cooking area? Is that——

Dr.  MARTYNY.  Yeah,  not  to  anything—we  have  not  been  able  to
do  that.  Even  individual  cooks  might  choose  different  methods.
There  are—lots  of  times,  these  cooks  are  being  done  by  a  co-op
now.

Mr.  GORDON.  But  I  mean,  because  they  do  that,  does  that  put  a

Dr. MARTYNY. No, not as far as we are concerned.
Mr.  GORDON.  Does  anybody  else  have  any  information  on  that?

fingerprint on it?

Dr. Bell.

Dr. BELL. I—we would agree with Dr. Martyny. We believe there
is—that  is  our  chemists  in  the—our  environmental  sciences  doc-
toral faculty believe there is potential research there that can track
it  by—because  again,  each  cook  brings  different  combinations  of
these drugs into the environment. And we believe there is a poten-
tial  for  that  tracking,  but  there  is  no  data  at  this  point  that
would——

Mr.  GORDON.  Well,  that  would  be—I  think  that  would  really  be
significant  if  we  could  get  down  to  the  point  where  it  actually  was
a fingerprint and we could—whether it were federal crimes or any-
thing else that we could trace it back.

Thank—did  you  have  anything,  Ms.  Green,  that  you  wanted  to

add to that contamination?

Thank you very much.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Just  to  add  on  to  that,  Sheriff,  when  you
go  in  with  a  bust  and  you  are  not  sure—if  they  are  not  actually
in  the  cooking  process  and  you  obtain  some  evidence,  you  are  not
sure  really  what  it  is.  I  mean,  you  just  can’t  look  at  it  and  say,
‘‘Well, this is meth,’’ or ‘‘This is cocaine,’’ or whatever it is, and you
send it off to a laboratory, is that correct?

Mr.  HOWARD.  That  is  correct.  We  send  everything  out  to  a  lab.

71

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  So  would  it  be  helpful  to  you,  and  I  think
I  know  the  answer,  and  I  am  not  just  trying  to  throw  you  a  soft-
ball,  but  if  we  did  the  necessary  research  so  we  develop  some  sort
of  detection  device  where  you  could  get  almost  instant  analysis
rather than sending it off to some lab in some distant city——

Mr.  HOWARD.  That  would  be  a  great  help.  We  send  evidence  off
now,  because  there  is  so  much  of  it  going  on.  We  get  backlogged.
The  labs  get  backlogged  on  it.  And  sometimes  it  is  three  to  six
months before we can get results on some testing. I mean, to have
an instantaneous test done would be unheard of.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Is that the type of research, Ms. Green and
Dr. Martyny, you think that we should engage in or at least be fea-
sible—and  is  it—do  you  think  it  is  feasible,  or  is  it  just  a  pipe
dream?

Dr.  MARTYNY.  No,  it  is  definitely  feasible.  I  think  that  there  are
a  lot  of  different  methodologies  that  could  be  used  for  very—much
more  rapid  testing  than  we  have  today.  The  capabilities  are  there.
We just haven’t proven that out yet.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Ms. Green.
Ms.  GREEN.  Yes,  I  would  agree  that  field-testing,  to  the  extent
that it is feasible, and I would defer to my distinguished colleagues
who know all of the science background. It would be preferable, be-
cause one of the main complaints we receive when we are working
with states is that they don’t know what they are getting into when
they go into it for first responders. And I would add that most peo-
ple  reference  law  enforcement  with  first  responders,  but  we  have
also  had  Child  Protective  Services  workers  who  have  told  us  that
they have realized later on that they have been walking in and out
of  a  house,  not  understanding  that  some  of  what  they  are  seeing
are  paraphernalia  of  a  manufacturing  lab.  So  there  are  a  number
of different individuals, in terms of first responders, or people who
would need that kind of test or ability to detect what they are actu-
ally seeing when they go into a house.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
Mr. Calvert.
Mr.  CALVERT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  again,  thank  you

for this hearing.

Unfortunately for us in California, we have quite a bit of experi-
ence  with  this.  And  we  have  had  some  progress,  and  some  of  the
law  enforcement  people  that  I  have  discussed  this  with  also  need
research.  And  one  of  the  things  that  was  pointed  out  to  me,  and
I don’t know if any research is being done elsewhere in the country,
is on thermal signature where equipment can be put on a police car
or  a  helicopter  or  other  equipment  where  you  can  identify  a  ther-
mal  signature  that  may  be  coming  out  of  a  trailer  or  from  a  motel
room  or  from  another  suspicious  location.  Is  there  anything—any
research  that  you  are  aware  of  that  is  being  done,  say,  at  Ten-
nessee Tech or other places on that?

Dr.  BELL.  There  are  speculations  about  how  that  could  be  done,
but  we  don’t  have  any  definitive  research.  A  member  of  the  Drug
Task Force is now a representative for the State of Tennessee and
has  introduced  some  legislation  to  look  at  that.  Judd  Matheny  is
his  name,  and  he  served  early  as  a  helicopter  pilot  in  marijuana,

thermal  analysis.  And  he  is  hopeful  that  there  is  some,  but  we
have no evidence of that at this point. It is worth investigation.

Mr. CALVERT. The reason I point that out, I am kind of double—
I am on the Defense Committee, also, and we have been using ther-
mal signatures for other purposes. And I don’t know if we could ex-
plore—I  know  there  is  an  issue  of  posse  commatadus  and  how  we
share  information  and  the  rest,  but  has  there  been  any  outreach
to the Department of Defense to maybe share in some of that tech-
nology, some of that research that is already being done, which we
use,  quite  frankly,  quite  often.  As  far  as  you  know,  there  hasn’t
been any sharing of information?

Dr. BELL. As far as I know, sir, there has not been.
Dr.  MARTYNY.  I  believe  there  has  been  some  work  by  Sandia
Labs,  trying  to  share  information  on  remote  sensing—developing
protocols  to  actually  be  able  to  do  remote  sensing  using  forward-
looking IFR and looking at some of these effluents coming off of the
materials.

Mr. CALVERT. I was aware of software development working with
utility  companies  to  find  spikes  in  utility  operations.  At  that—has
that been, in any way, perfected, or does that still need some work?
I  know  that  individual  motel  chains  have  been  using  that  because
of  the  problems  they  have  had  in  motel  rooms  and  cooking  and
those  kinds  of  things.  But  are  you  seeing  evidence  of  that  in,  say,
upstate New York?

Mr.  HOWARD.  We  haven’t  had  any  utilization  of  any  software  in
that means. The power companies in our area are more than help-
ful  when  asked  if  they  have  had  any  spikes  in  the  area,  but  we
haven’t had any software development or usage of software.

Mr.  CALVERT.  Well,  and  one  last  comment.  I  know,  because  of
some  success  we  have  had  in  California,  unfortunately  these  labs
are  being  pushed  out  to  the  rest  of  the  country,  most  of  the  meth-
amphetamine  that  is  coming  now  into  California,  90  percent  prob-
ably—and  I  don’t  know  what  it  is  nationwide,  is  coming  out  of
these  super  labs,  primarily  out  of  Mexico  and  being  smuggled
across.  So  that  is  a—that  is  probably  a  problem  Mr.  Burns  has  to
deal  with,  and  I  know  that  is  probably  not  the  jurisdiction  of  this
committee,  but  I  just  want  to  point  that  out.  And  if  you  have  any
comment about that, that is the difficulty we are unfortunately liv-
ing under right now.

Mr. BURNS. Well, you are absolutely right, Congressman Calvert.
We  have  to  be  as  fluid  as  the  traffickers.  For  a  time,  the  vast  ma-
jority  of  pseudoephedrine  was,  as  you  know,  coming  in  from  Can-
ada.  We  responded  to  that  threat.  We  have  seen  a  significant  re-
duction of the super labs in your state, as much as a 50 to 60 per-
cent reduction. And you are correct. We believe the threat has now
moved  to  Mexico.  I  guess  if  there  is  any  good  news,  they  are  pol-
luting the rivers and the streams and the forests and the beautiful
land  in  Mexico,  as  opposed  to  your  state,  but  the  bad  news  is  the
poison continues to flow into the United States. So we are respond-
ing.

Mr. CALVERT. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
Mr. Matheson.

Mr. MATHESON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Mr. Burns, it is
good to see an Iron County person here in Washington. Bring some
common sense to this town. I appreciate you being here.

Mr. BURNS. Thanks for saying that.
Mr.  MATHESON.  I  wanted  to  ask  you  a  quick  question  about—
within  ONDCP.  How  does  it  break  out  in  terms  of  resources  that
look  at  meth  compared  to  other  drugs,  say  marijuana  or  whatnot?
Do you have a sense of how your resources are devoted to different
types of drugs?

Mr.  BURNS.  Yeah,  that  is  a  great  question,  because  we  know
through household survey and we know through the monitoring the
future  survey  that  the  19.5  million  illegal  drug  users  in  this  coun-
try,  about  75  percent  are  singularly  or  co-using  higher-potency
marijuana.  We  know  that  about  six  million  are  using  illegal  pre-
scription  drugs,  about  150  percent  increase  in  the  last  five  years,
as  many  of  you  know,  Oxycontin  and  Vicodin  and  Lortab.  About
three  million  are  using  cocaine,  1.5  million  using  heroin,  and  1.5
million  using  methamphetamines.  So  if  you  look  at  it  macro  and
you look at the numbers, you would ask, ‘‘Why methamphetamine?
Why  is  everybody  talking  about  this  drug  when  of  the  19.5,  only
1.5  million  are  using  it?’’  And  the  reason  why  it  has  been  ad-
dressed,  yaba,  ice,  crystal,  crank,  meth,  whatever  you  want  to  call
it,  is  the  most  destructive  drug.  It  gives  the  user  an  immediate
feeling  of  euphoria  and  energy,  but  it  doesn’t  really  give  it,  it  just
lends it. And what the user has to pay back is at a very, very high
cost.

We  have,  in  the  National  Drug  Office,  responded.  We  have  re-
sponded through the Drug Endangered Children Program, or DEC,
wherein  we  are  trying  to  have  each  state  come  up  with  a  program
to  deal  with  children  that  are  found  in  these  labs.  We  have  re-
sponded  through  the  National  Methamphetamine  Chemical  Initia-
tive, which, frankly, brings together key methamphetamine law en-
forcement  people  from  all  of  the  jurisdictions  across  the  country
two  or  three  times  a  year  to  talk  about  trends  shifting  from  Cali-
fornia to Mexico and how we respond. And I would say, frankly, the
HIDTA program, 28 HIDTA offices across the country, out of all of
the  individual  drugs,  and  these  areas  pick  what  is  their  primary
threat,  there  are  more  initiatives  directed  towards  methamphet-
amine  than  any  other  drug.  So  hopefully,  we  have  our  priorities
right.

Mr.  MATHESON.  And  do  you  sense,  in  terms  of—you  mentioned
the numbers from the last—but in terms of growth of use, I assume
meth  is  one  of  the  higher  growth  rates  in  terms  of  where—com-
pared  to  the  other  drugs  you  have  mentioned.  Is  that  a  fair  state-
ment?

Mr.  BURNS.  Except  for  the  last  one  or  two  in  the  future  survey
shows  a  25  percent  reduction  among  kids,  which  is  encouraging.
And  you  mentioned  it  is  good  the  media  is  here.  It  is  good  the
media is here, because I think we are spreading the word about the
destructive nature of this drug.

Mr.  MATHESON.  A  question  for  Dr.  Bell.  You  mentioned  how  the
research  you  have  done  has  been  helpful  in  developing  legislation
in  your  state.  And  I  had  to  step  out  for  just  a  minute,  so  I—you
may  have  addressed  this,  but  I  wanted  to  know  if  you  share  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:10 Apr 25, 2005 Jkt 099573 PO 00000 Frm 00077 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\030305\99573 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

research with other states. And is there a mechanism to provide ac-
cess where people are sharing their information in that regard?

Dr. BELL. Yes, there is a mechanism. The research that we have
done  at  Tech  was  done  over  the  Christmas  holidays  because  of
safety issues for the students. And it was embargoed until the new
bill  was  introduced  about  two  weeks  ago,  so  it  is  just  now  flowing
out. The drug task forces and the governor’s office both have mech-
anisms for sharing with other places.

Mr.  MATHESON.  And  in  terms  of  development  of—you  said  this
is  going  to  help  develop  some  proposed  legislation  that  your  gov-
ernor is supporting, I understand?

Dr. BELL. That is correct.
Mr. MATHESON. And do you have a sense of—this is probably not
a  fair  question  for  you  to  ask,  but  are  other  states  trying  to  look
at the Tennessee model now with this proposed legislation?

Dr.  BELL.  My  sense  is  other  states  are  interested,  much  like  we
are interested, in what is happening in other states, so I think this
model  can  be  used  in  other  states.  There  are  some  challenging
issues in the legislation, and certainly the restriction of sale of the
over-the-counter  drug  is  one  of  those.  So  I  know  other  states  will
be following it with a great deal of interest.

Mr. MATHESON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. CALVERT. [Presiding.] Okay. Mr. Reichert.
Mr.  REICHERT.  That  is  okay,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  am  the  new  guy
here,  but  I  do  have  a  keen  interest  in  this  topic  for  a  number  of
reasons.  Sheriff,  just  eight  weeks  ago,  I  was  a  Sheriff,  so  I  know
exactly what you are dealing with. I was the Sheriff of King Coun-
ty in Seattle, Washington. And about 10 years ago, you may recall,
DEA  made  an  announcement,  meth  will  be  the  next  dangerous
drug  that  we  are  going  to  have  to  deal  with  across  this  nation.
About five years ago in King County, we pulled together a team of
people,  statewide,  Sheriffs,  Police  Chiefs,  and  every  discipline,  and
what I am pleased to see today is that you have come together here
as  a  team,  because  this  doesn’t  just  touch  law  enforcement  or  fire-
fighters  or  environmentalists.  This  really  touches  at  the  heart  of
this country. This touches our children.

And  that  is  the  second  thing  I  want  to  talk  about.  One  of  my
grandchildren happens to be a baby who was born to a mother who
was  addicted  to  methamphetamines.  And  he  right  now  is  almost
three  years  old  and  is  dealing  with  some  learning  disabilities  and
also has some breathing issues as, I think, one of the witnesses tes-
tified to today as a possible health side effect.

Third,  this  drug  is  so  dangerous,  it  takes—if  you  are  hooked  on
this  drug  for  one  year,  it  can  take  five  years  to  kick  it.  At  first,  it
was thought that you couldn’t kick it. So two years—one year—two
years,  you  can  lose  10  years  of  your  life.  And  that  is  the  reality  of
this  drug,  and  that  is  why  it  is  so  important  for  us  to  fight  this
battle.

As  a  citizen,  I  was  asleep  one  night  at  home,  and  I  heard  some
noise  outside  my  driveway.  So,  still  as  the  Sheriff,  I  thought  I
would  investigate  that  and  discovered  that  a  mobile  meth  lab  had
pulled  into  my  driveway  in  a  rural  area  southeast  of  Seattle,

other  danger  to  our  community.  We  have  established,  in  Wash-
ington State, throughout the state, meth action teams. And in King
County, we have a 35-member team, and I will just list some of the
disciplines  very  quickly  as  to  those  people  who  are  a  part  of  those
teams: law enforcement, social and health services, education, envi-
ronmental, real estate, federal, prosecuting attorneys, the Congres-
sional delegation. All of those people have come—prevention, inter-
vention, and treatment. Those people all have come together to ad-
dress  this  issue.  In  fact,  Dr.  Keppoy—I  am  sorry,  James  Kopple,  I
saw  walk  in,  was  one  of  the  people  who  helped  us  in  the  State  of
Washington  put  our  meth  action  teams  together,  so  I  think  he
would be a great resource for you coming from the National Crime
Prevention Council.

My  question  is,  as  you  move  together  as  a  team,  do  you  see  this
legislation helping you develop partnerships in some of these areas
that  I  mentioned  so  we  can  have  a  holistic  approach  to  this  prob-
lem? Anybody?

Ms. GREEN. Congressman, I certainly do. I think this is probably
one of the best mechanisms that I have seen in recent years to en-
sure—and  from  my  perspective,  one  of  the  things  I  am  very  much
interested  in  is  ensuring  that  accurate  information  gets  to  policy-
makers  who  are  making  decisions  on—about  what  will  happen  in
their  state.  And  I  think  it  is  one  of  the  best  mechanisms  I  have
seen  to  ensure  that,  on  an  issue  where  legislation  and  policy  must
keep  pace  with  innovations  in  research  and  technology,  to  ensure
that state-of-the-art information gets to all of the different constitu-
encies  and  disciplines  that  have  to,  basically,  address  the  issues
arising from methamphetamine laboratories, whether it is trying to
decide  what  particular  protocols  to  use  with  children  who  have
been  removed  or  attempting  to  deal  with  what  kind  of  liability
issues  and  cleanup  issues  you  may  have,  either  in  a  rural  area,  or
as  people  are  now  talking  to  us  about,  in  apartments  and  hotel
rooms.  I  think  it  is  a  very  critical  mechanism  to  ensure  that  kind
of collaboration and the widespread dissemination of accurate infor-
mation about how to address these methamphetamine laboratories.
Mr.  REICHERT.  Let  me  just  comment,  too,  that  when  we  started
our effort to fight meth in the State of Washington, we were num-
ber two in the state as to the number of meth labs in the country.
Today,  we  are  number  six.  The  county  just  south  of  King  County,
where  I  was  the  Sheriff,  last  year,  however,  had  500  labs.  King
County  had  about  250.  We  have  made  some  progress.  And  I  think
with  NCPC’s  help,  hopefully  you  could  connect  up  with  the  Na-
tional  Crime  Prevention  Council,  and  there  is  also  another  organi-
zation  called  the  Pierce  County  Alliance,  which  has  made  great
progress  in  studying  the  effects  on  children  and  also  some  of  the
effects on the community as a whole.

So  thank  you  very  much,  and  thank  you  all  for  your  hard  work.

And Sheriff, it is nice to have another Sheriff in town.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Congressman.
Mr. Green.
Mr.  GREEN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Mr.  Ranking  Mem-
ber. I salute both of you and compliment you for having these hear-
ings,  and  quite  candidly,  for  being—allowing  me  to  be  a  part  of
these hearings as a neophyte.

I  want  to  commend  the  panel.  This  has  been  an  outstanding
panel, and what you have said has been more than edifying. It has
truly  been  an  education  for  me  today  to  hear  much  of  what  you
said.

I  have  any  number  of  concerns,  because  the  omnipresent  nature
of the problem seems to create quite an enigma for you. I have no-
ticed  that  we  seem  to  be  in  our  infancy  as  we  are  quarreling  our
empirical  data,  which  means  that  we  haven’t  quite  gathered  the
sense  of  direction  that  we  are  looking  for.  And  some  of  my  ques-
tions will relate to the sense of direction.

But  first,  Ms.  Green,  you  mentioned  liability  issues  just  a  mo-
ment  ago.  Do  we  have  any  sense  of  what  type  of  standardized  no-
tice should be accorded a property owner who has had the unfortu-
nate circumstance to develop in his property with a lab?

Ms.  GREEN.  Yes,  Congressman.  There  are  several  statutes,  in
particular Washington State and Oregon, that have dealt quite sig-
nificantly with notice issues. And there are really three types of no-
tice  issues  that  are  dealt  with  with  respect  to  an  owner.  The  first
is  when  someone,  like  law  enforcement,  first  notices  a  lab,  what
kind of notice do they have to make to state officials and then what
is  the  responsibility  of  those  particular  agency  officials  to  contact
the owner to see if the owner knows. There is also a particular no-
tice that has to be placed in certain county auditor records. In some
respects, people are attempting to put notice in certain title records
and  other  kinds  of  public  notice  property  records  that  would  allow
an  owner,  even  an  absentee  owner,  to  identify,  upon  regular  pe-
rusal of those types of records. There is also a different type of no-
tice,  which  is  a  build-upon  to  what  you  just  suggested  in  terms  of
the owner knowing, which is a future owner, a potential purchaser.
There  are  particular  states  that  would  require  a  seller  to  give  no-
tice to a potential purchaser that there has been a particular meth
lab  on  that  particular  property.  And  the  potential  purchaser  has  a
number  of  days  to  decide  whether  or  not  to  cancel  that  particular
contract.

So many states, particularly in the west, are addressing that par-

ticular notice type of issue.
Mr. GREEN. Thank you.
And  Dr.  Bell,  you  talked  about  what  I  will  call  an—well,  I  sup-
pose  an  intrastate  integrated  system  that  is  being  developed.  How
can we efficaciously move to an interstate integrated system?

Dr. BELL. As you said earlier, we are in the infancy of many ap-
proaches to addressing this problem. The data collection is one, but
certainly  the  collaboration  is  still  in  a  learning  stage,  too.  In  most
states,  there  is  a  task  force  that  links  to  other  states.  The  gov-
ernor’s  office  in  our  state,  and  I  presume  in  most,  has  a  coordi-
nator. And there are individual mechanisms that are loosely linked
at this point that, over time, I think we will see much more matu-
rity.  But  certainly,  at  the  federal  level,  it  would  help  to  continue
the efforts that are already there to coordinate through the number
of agencies that are currently involved. DEA, National Institutes of
Health  (NIH),  all  of  these,  right  now,  are  involved  in  one  way  or
another.  I  think  the  issue  is  going  to  be  how  we  find  a  focused
group that truly is interstate in nature. There are several now. The
question is how to focus on one interstate activity in the long-term.

Mr.  GREEN.  And  my  final  question  is  for  Mr.  Howard,  Sheriff

Howard.

Protecting  protectors  is,  sometimes,  expensive  proposition.  Have
you  now  a  grasp  on  how  this  is  impacting  your  budget,  the  whole
notion  of  acquiring  the  necessary  funds  so  that  when  people  do
rush into these unfortunate situations, they are properly protected?
How does that impact your budget, please?

Mr.  HOWARD.  It  has  impacted  our  budget,  obviously.  We  are  a
relatively  small  department.  I  have  126  employees.  We  have  ap-
plied  for  and  received  several  grants  for  equipment  and  training,
which  we  have  utilized  in  the  last  two  to  three  years.  Also,  there
is  a  lot  of  forfeiture  laws  and  seizure  laws  that  we  have  taken  ad-
vantage  of,  and  we  take  that  monies  that  we  have  received  and
turn  it  back  into  training  and  education  for  the  men  and  women
in my department.

So we are keeping our head above water, as far as that goes, but
it is an impact on the budget. The problem we run into is the man-
power  issue  on  labs.  I  have  a  12-man  team  for  the  labs,  but  half
of that team are uniformed officers. The other half are plain-clothes
investigators.  Those  investigators  are  the  ones  that  really  do  the
legwork  on  these  labs.  It  takes  hundreds  of  hours,  and  that  is
where  the  budget  comes  into  play,  the  manpower  that  we  have  to
pay out for those men.

Mr. GREEN. Thank you.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Sheriff, would you also respond to the first
part  of  Mr.  Green’s  question,  the  first  phase  of  it,  because  I  think
it  is  very  important?  What  notification  requirement  is  there?  You
go  in.  You  bust.  You  apprehend.  You  secure  the  crime  scene.  The
judicial  system  works  its  will,  and  hopefully,  the  perpetrator  ends
up  behind  bars  where  he  or  she  belongs.  But  what  do  you  do  or
what is the New York, Mr. Hamilton, obligation to notify the prop-
erty  owner?  I  mean,  if  it  is  a  rented  apartment  or  a  motel,  they
didn’t  do  anything  wrong,  and  they  are  not  aware  of  anything.
They  are  not  facilitators,  but  they  have  to  know  that  this  took
place  within  their  property,  because,  as  you  have  convinced  me,
and  you  have  shown  me  the  evidence,  you  know,  the  property  is
contaminated.  So  an  innocent  landowner,  renting  out  an  apart-
ment,  an  innocent  motel  owner  renting  out  a  room,  this  illegal  ac-
tivity  takes  place,  law  enforcement  works  its  will,  what  about  the
aftermath? What about the carpets? You come in and vacuum it or
paint the wall, but there are still contaminants in the drywall and
the carpet, and the next occupier has little kids playing around on
the  floor,  as  all  little  kids  do.  So  what  is  the  notification  require-
ment in New York? Who wants to——

Mr.  HAMILTON.  Well,  in  New  York,  a  standard  practice  is  to  no-
tify everyone that we can, everyone under the sun. And that is not
far  off  the  mark,  because  there  are  so  many  aspects  to  this  prob-
lem,  as  you  well  know.  We  contact  the  Social  Services  people,  cer-
tainly the public health officials, local code enforcement people, and
that is all in addition to notifying the property owner. The——

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  How  do  you  do  that,  because  the  Sheriff,
after  his  success,  reports  in,  and  that  material  comes—that  infor-
mation comes to you, among others?

78

Mr. HAMILTON. Typically, a law enforcement agency, such as the
Sheriff’s  department  who  goes  in  to  seize  a  lab  or  to  execute  a
search  warrant,  when  they—if  they  don’t  already  know  going  in
that  they  are  dealing  with  a  meth  lab,  soon  realize  that  they  are
dealing with toxic waste, the potential dumping of toxic substances,
and will routinely call the Department of Environmental Conserva-
tion  or  local  environmental  officials.  We  come  in,  assess  the  situa-
tion,  and,  as  part  of  that  assessment,  bring  in  and/or  notify  local
public health officials, local code enforcement people, et cetera, and
the  property  owner.  I  almost  sound  like  I  am  saying  that  as  an
afterthought,  but  it  is  not.  What  is  important  here,  and  in  fact,
maybe  this  is  an  important  point  to  raise,  there  is  an  anomaly  for
the  environmental  community  and  the  environmental  agencies
with  regard  to  dealing  with  methamphetamine  clan  labs,  and  that
is  this:  most  environmental  laws  are  meant  to  deal  with  toxic
dumping  and  illegal  handling  of  toxic  substances,  usually  by  large
industrial or commercial generators. And as a result, those are en-
tities,  which  usually  can  be—which  can  be  brought  to  bring  their
financial assets to bear to finance the clean up of the problem. For
obvious  reasons,  with  methamphetamine  clan  labs,  first  of  all,  the
property  owner,  many  times,  is  not  the  person  who  generated  the
waste.  Second  of  all,  the  property  owner  may  be  a—may  not  have
the  financial  means  that  a  large  industrial  or  commercial  entity
would  to  finance  a  clean  up.  Certainly,  the  operators,  the  cookers,
who set up and work the lab, are usually not people who have the
financial means that we can latch onto to do this clean up. So there
is  a  financial  aspect  that  comes  in  here  that  wasn’t  anticipated
when  some  of  the  environmental  protection  laws  were  passed  and,
you  know,  we  are  just  beginning  to  encounter  and  deal  with  that
issue now.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you for that.
But  you,  in  your  response,  you  said  typically  the  Sheriff  would
report.  Is  it  typically  or  what  about  the  atypical  situations?  The
point  is,  Sheriff,  are  you  required  to  report  on  high  when  you  en-
gage in a bust like this?

Mr.  HOWARD.  No.  No,  we  are  not.  We  try  to—as  Mr.  Hamilton
says, we typically notify everybody that we can and let them know
what is going on, but atypically, no, we don’t. There are times that
we don’t notify everyone.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  And  that  is  one  of  the  causes  of  concern
here,  because  the  next  tenant  of  that  motel  room  or  that  rented
apartment  or  the  next  purchaser  of  the  motel  or  the  apartment,
they—as  I  said,  they  don’t  know  past  history  unless  there  is  some
sort  of  record.  I  mean,  good  gosh,  we  require  a  termite  report.  If
you sell a property in Virginia, you have got to certify that it is ter-
mite free. Maybe we ought to do something along this line, not for
every  residence,  obviously,  but  perhaps  for  those,  Ms.  Green,  that
where  we  know  illegal  activity  has  taken  place.  One,  there  should
be  some  sort  of  notification  requirement,  it  seems  to  me,  to  make
sure  that  the  proper  people  do  know,  but  a  requirement,  not  just,
‘‘Oh, tell if you get a chance.’’ Well, that is enough said.

Mr. Schwarz.

Mr. SCHWARZ. Am I correct—and this is for Mr. Burns. Am I cor-
rect  in  thinking  that  methamphetamine,  because  of  some  very  ob-
scure medical uses, is still schedule two?

Mr. BURNS. Are you talking about on a——
Mr.  SCHWARZ.  I  am  talking  about  the  substance  itself,  when
they—you  can  still  legally  make  it,  some  companies  do,  that  has
some—they use it for narcolepsy.

Mr.  BURNS.  The  drug  methamphetamine  has  no  legitimate  med-

ical use.

Mr. SCHWARZ. The——
Mr. BURNS. None.
Mr. SCHWARZ. Then why is it not schedule one?
Mr. BURNS. In many——
Mr. SCHWARZ. States it is.
Mr. BURNS. Yes.
Mr.  SCHWARZ.  We  have  made  it  schedule  one  in  Michigan,  but

federally——

Mr. BURNS. Yes.
Mr. SCHWARZ.—I believe it is still schedule two, is it not?
Mr.  BURNS.  Yes,  the—that  is  one  of  the  issues  that  we  are  ad-

dressing in the synthetic action plan.

Mr.  SCHWARZ.  Yeah.  And  Mr.  Chairman,  that  is  one  thing  that
we  should  do  federally  is  put  it  in  statute,  I  believe,  that  meth-
amphetamine  is  a  schedule  one  substance  and  has  no  legitimate
medical  use,  because,  in  fact,  there  are  a  number—I  am  a  physi-
cian.  That  is—let  me  preface  my  remarks  with  that.  There  are
other Central Nervous System (CNS) stimulants around——

Mr. BURNS. Correct.
Mr.  SCHWARZ.—that  can  be  used,  and  methamphetamine  itself

has no legitimate use. And I agree completely with that.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Good  point.  Is  that  something,  Mr.  Burns,
that  we  can  get  you  to  seriously  entertain  as  you  tackle  this  prob-
lem?

Mr. BURNS. Certainly, Mr. Chairman. Let me just say Ms. Green
and  I  run  into  each  other  probably  two  or  three  times  a  month
crisscrossing this country trying to deal with individual states who
are struggling with this. I was with Congressman Walden a couple
of  weeks  ago  in  Oregon.  In  Oregon,  Congressman  Hooley  would
know that the penalties are more severe for marijuana than meth-
amphetamine.  And  so  it  has  been  a  constant  effort  on  our  part  at
the  White  House  to  go  from  state  to  state  to  try  and  assist  them
individually.

Chairman BOEHLERT. But we all, the White House included, and
this  committee  included,  have  to  be  very  vocal  about  helping  to
educate the public.
Mr. BURNS. Yes.
Chairman BOEHLERT. And you know, I find—and I am not going

to take this out of your time, but I find, for example——

Mr. SCHWARZ. Thank you.
Chairman BOEHLERT.—in town meetings from back home, to em-
phasize  the  seriousness  of  this,  we  will  start  out  with  a  youth
group, particularly, or a PTA group. You know. Experts tell us, try
something  like  meth  today  and  the  odds  are  heavily  against  you
living  beyond  the  next  couple  of  years.  You  will  be  dead  in  five

years.  Boy,  that  grabs  their  attention.  And  then  you  begin  to  talk
about the problem.

Back to you, Dr. Schwarz.
Mr. SCHWARZ. Yeah, and I believe that methamphetamine should
be federally recognized as a schedule one substance with absolutely
no legitimate medical usage in the year 2005, and there is no ques-
tion in my mind.

Dr. Bell, are you a pharmacologist or——
Dr. BELL. No, sir. I have a Ph.D. in business administration.
Mr. SCHWARZ. You are not a pharmacologist then.
Dr.  BELL.  I  am  just  a  college  president,  which  means  I  know  a

little about everything.

Mr.  SCHWARZ.  Well,  there  is  someone  on  the  panel,  what  is  the
source—the ephedra that comes into this country—legitimately, the
raw  ephedra,  where  does  it  come  from?  Is  it  the  Far  East  some
place? I believe. And so——

Mr. BURNS. You are correct. There are about seven major sources
internationally for both ephedrine and pseudoephedrine that comes
into the country.

Mr. SCHWARZ. But the raw ephedra——
Mr. BURNS. Correct.
Mr.  SCHWARZ.—itself,  because  we  refine  it  and  make  the
pseudoephedrine. Would it not be appropriate to somehow put fed-
eral  restrictions  on  the  substance  ephedra  itself  as  it  comes  into
the  country?  States  have  done  it.  As  you  know,  in  numbers  of
states, you can only buy so many ephedrine-containing pills at your
local  7-Eleven  or  something  of  that  nature.  Would  it  not  be  appro-
priate  to  somehow  federally  limit  the  amount  of  ephedra  that  can
come into the country? I ask the question just for my own informa-
tion.

Mr.  BURNS.  Yes.  In  fact,  that  is  one  of  the  key  topics,  again,  of
the synthetic action plan that will be out in April is to address that
very issue that you raised, that we treat it as we do other imported
drugs  and  control  it  and  schedule  it.  We  look  at  the  importation.
We  look  at  the  bulk  sales.  We  look  at  the  spot  market  and  control
it much better.

Mr. SCHWARZ. So would it not enhance that cause to memorialize

that concept in statute as well?

Mr.  BURNS.  That  is  where  we  are  headed.  We  will  recommend

that to you at some point, I hope.

Mr.  SCHWARZ.  Thank  you  very  much.  And  I  would—Mr.  Chair-
man and to the people who are here testifying, I very, very strongly
support this bill, because the effluvia from meth labs is as toxic as
toxic can be, and my Congressional District in Michigan is an area
where  we  have  bust  after  bust  after  bust  of  ephedrine  labs.  So
thank  you  very  kindly  for  being  here,  and  thank  you,  Mr.  Chair-
man.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Dr. Schwarz.
Let us see. Mr. Davis.
Mr.  DAVIS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  want  to  compliment
Ranking  Member  Bart  Gordon  and  other  Members  of  this  com-
mittee,  you  as  well,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  realizing  the  necessity  for
the bill that we have before us today.

I represent a rural area in Tennessee. When you look at the dif-
ferent analyses, the 4th Congressional District has the fourth most
rural  residency  of  the  435  Congressional  Districts  in  this  country.
Probably 95 percent of the Cumberland Plateau, with a population
of  roughly  450,000  people  live  in  the  District  that  I  represent.  Dr.
Bell,  your  work  with  local  law  enforcement,  your  work  with  the
governor’s task force and others certainly needs to be recognized for
starting  a  process  that  can  at  least  help  law  enforcement  and  oth-
ers  in  our  state,  and  perhaps  even  the  Nation,  in  being  able  to
identify and find some way to give some relief or at least some pre-
warning  to  law  enforcement  officers,  the  first  responders  who  may
be going to a meth site.

We  have  talked  some  today  about  the  capital  of  real  estate  that
an  owner  might  lose.  But  the  human  capital  that  we  are  losing  in
the area that I represent, there is, perhaps, not a family in my Dis-
trict  that  either  does  not  know  someone  or  have  a  close  or  distant
relative  that  has—their  life  been  taken  as  the  result  of  meth-
amphetamine.  It  is  a  horrible  affliction.  It  is  a  cancer  that  con-
tinues  to  eat.  And  it  is  cheap,  and  it  is  deadly.  I  hope  this  legisla-
tion—and  we  are  talking  about  the  bill  today.  I  hope  this  legisla-
tion  will  at  least  put  in  motion  the  experimentation,  the  research,
the finding of some answers as well as warning systems for our law
enforcement  and  for  people  in  the  District  that  I  represent  and
throughout the space nearby the danger of methamphetamines.

Having said that, Dr. Burns, in the District I represent, there are
eight counties that have had at least 20 meth lab busts in the last
year. Pretty harsh. If you look at the resources that you have avail-
able,  $200  and  some  odd  million  I  think  is  what  I  see,  how  much
of those—or what percentage of those would be utilized in address-
ing this problem of methamphetamine? When we are talking about
a  problem  that  has  been  nationwide  recognized,  and  certainly  the
areas  that  I  represent  probably  the  last  five  to  eight  years,  mari-
juana,  heroine,  cocaine,  other  different  addictive  substances—obvi-
ously  we  have  had  a  constant  war  on  drugs  in  the  last  30  or  40
years.  This  new  drug  seems  to  be  hitting  everyone,  regardless  of
their  economic  scales  or—how  much—of  the  total  resources  that
you  have,  how  much  are  you  directing  towards  solving  this  prob-
lem, the methamphetamine?

Mr.  BURNS.  You  know,  I  would  have  to  do  a  breakdown  and  get
back  to  you  with  some  specific  numbers.  I  can  tell  you  that  over
the  last  two  years,  in  2004  and  this  year,  in  excess  of  $50  million
for  clean  up  to  assist  the  states.  As  I  said  earlier,  the  HIDTA  pro-
gram supports State and local law enforcement. And I think we all
have  to  remember  that  the  primary  responsibility  is  local  Sheriffs
and  Chiefs  and  law  enforcement.  But  we  have  tried  to,  in  a  stra-
tegic  fashion,  support  their  efforts.  And  you  are  correct;  your  state
has  probably  been  disproportionately  hit  harder  than  any  other
state in the country in the last 12 to 18 months.

Mr. DAVIS. Congressman Gordon’s initiatives and with my work-
ing  with  him  has  been  able  to  find  about  $500,000  in  grants  for  a
judicial  district  in  our  District.  And  one  of  the  successes  I  think
that we are seeing, perhaps, in the area where there may be more
concentration  population-wise,  which  is  the  northern  part  of  the
plateau,  by  working  with  local  law  enforcement,  developing  an  in-

formation  booklet  that  has  been  sent,  basically,  to  each  home.  But
we  have  had  this  trouble  in  finding  those  dollars  to  be  able  to  at
least  provide  an  information  flow,  a  warning  system.  Bill  Gibson,
the  district  attorney,  has  worked—instead  of  using  the  money  for
putting  more  law  enforcement  officers,  really  felt  that  education  is
something  that  ought  to  be  a  part  of  that.  Are  there  dollars  avail-
able  from  your  agency  that  could  help  provide  funding  for
educational——

Mr.  BURNS.  There  are,  and  I  would  also  add  that  the  National
Youth  Anti-drug  Media  campaign,  we  have  seen,  I  believe,  great
success with marijuana, and it is our intent to, in the near future,
start  doing  methamphetamine  ads  to  better  educate  folks  across
the country.

Mr.  DAVIS.  Dr.  Bell,  again,  thanks  for  the  work  that  you  are

doing.

I have got to ask you this question. If you had additional funding
available  to  you,  and  you  seem  to  be  the  one  college  in  Tennessee
that  is  probably  doing  the  research  of  finding  solutions  that  we
must have to address this problem, but if you had additional fund-
ing,  how  much  more  successful  could  you  be  in  giving  hope  and
avenues  available  to  help  fight  this  problem  in  the  up  and
coming——

Dr. BELL. That is a question that is very appropriate. Obviously,
it  would  allow  us  to  do  more  basic  research.  It  would  allow  us  to
do  more  outreach.  And  in  that  sense,  the  funding  would  simply
magnify  what  we  are  currently  doing  and  let  us  leverage  what  we
are doing.

You  mentioned  the  booklet  the  drug  task  force  has  done.  The
most  recent  product,  Congressman  Davis,  is  an  interactive  CD–
ROM  that  has  age-appropriate  material  on  it.  It  can  be  filtered  by
the age of the child or the class that they are in. There is also ma-
terial  on  here  that  can  be  focused  on  sanitation  workers,  on  emer-
gency  medical  services  workers,  on  firemen,  or  on  police,  or  many
others.  So  we  are  moving  to  a  point  that  we  can  help  deliver  to
school  systems  and  to  others  not  just  printed  material,  but  also
interactive  material  that  a  teacher  can  use.  They  can  pull  off  of
this outlines of curricula, interactive tests that they can work with
with  the  students.  And  things  like  that  take  resources.  We  cur-
rently,  through  that  grant  that  you  were  talking  about,  have  the
capability  to  produce  a  number  of  these.  I  brought  ten  copies  for
the  Committee  as  a  pre-release,  but  this  should  be  going  public
next  week,  and  I  will  be  sure  that  each  Member  of  the  Committee
is  given  one.  Again,  further  resources  would  let  us  distribute  that
in a much wider fashion.

Mr.  DAVIS.  I  thank  the  panel  for  being  here.  Mr.  Chairman,

thanks for giving me an opportunity.

I yield back the rest of my time.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Dr. Bartlett.
Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you very much.
Do I understand that ephedrine is one of the substances used in
making  this  drug?  I  am  searching  a  very  old  memory  bank,  but
what is the relationship between ephedrine and adrenaline?

Mr. BURNS. I would defer to Dr. Schwarz.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Dr. Schwarz.
Mr.  SCHWARZ.  They  are  vaguely  related  in  that  they  are  both
stimulants.  Adrenaline  is  a  vascular  stimulant  that  has  vasoactive
properties,  as  does  ephedrine.  They  are  both,  in  fact,  very  strong
bronchi-dilators,  that  is  why  when  you  have  somebody  in  status
asthmatics,  they  are—their  bronchi  are  just  clamped  right  down.
You  give  them  adrenaline  and  people  who  are  asthmatics,  fre-
quently  asthmatics,  will  be  taking  an  ephedrine-containing  com-
pound  as  well  as  a  dilator.  So  they  have  numbers  of  very  similar
pharmacologic effects.

Mr. BURNS. That is exactly what I was going to say.
Mr. BARTLETT. It was my memory that ephedrine has essentially
physiologically  the  effects  of  adrenaline.  Does  that  mean  that  one
of  the  effects  of  this  drug  is  that  it  is  sympathomimetic?  That  is
one of the effects of the drug? Okay.

Yeah,  what  we  are  doing  here  today  reminds  me  a  little  of  the
story  of  the  Thursday  night  prayer  meetings  in  a  rural  church
where every week Brother Jones in his prayer would ask the Lord
to remove the cobwebs of sin from his life. And after several weeks
of  this,  one  of  the  ladies,  when  it  came  her  time  to  pray,  prayed
that  the  Lord  would  please  kill  the  spider  of  sin  in  Brother  Jones’
life. What we are dealing with here, of course, are the cobwebs. The
spider  here  is  obviously  the  demand  for  this  drug.  And  as  long  as
there  is  a  demand  for  this  drug,  there  will  be  laboratories  making
this drug. Do you feel that we are directing enough resources to un-
derstanding  the  culture  that  could  support  this  kind  of  drug  use,
because ultimately, that is the only way we are going to solve this
problem? If we don’t understand the culture and stop the demand,
you are going to forever be mopping up these—the consequences of
these  labs.  Yeah.  We  need  to  do  that.  You  know,  as  it  said  in  the
New Testament, ‘‘This ought you to have done and not to have left
the  other  undone.’’  And  we  have  got  to  mop  up  these  labs,  but  at
the  same  time,  we  have  got  to  be  moving  aggressively  to  under-
standing  the  culture  that  supports  this  level  of  use.  Do  you  think
that  we  are  nationally  committing  enough  resources  to  under-
standing  this?  This  is  a  dumb  thing  for  young  people  to  do,  and  it
is clearly a matter of education.

Ms. GREEN. Congressman, based on what we are seeing when we
work  with  states,  I—my  answer  would  be  no.  We  are  not  doing
enough.  I  think  because  many  states  were  hit  with  the  ballooning
of  the  meth  labs,  their  attention  primarily  focused  on  taking  the
labs  down  and  the  consequences  to  the  children  removed.  I  think
there  is  insufficient  attention  and  insufficient  resources,  both  na-
tionally and in every state, that is being directed towards the edu-
cation  end  of  it,  also  the  treatment  end  of  it  and  understanding
what treatment is available and providing adequate levels and mo-
dalities  of  treatment  to  address  the  problem,  so  we  don’t  have,  as
the Director of Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics told me, in their in-
stance,  the  reason  their  meth  labs  were  out  of  control  is  they  had
active  addicts  repeatedly  returning  to  the  culture  and  making  the
methamphetamine.  So  my  answer  would  be,  based  on  what  I  am
seeing at the state level, no.

Mr.  BURNS.  Let  me  just  add  to  that.  Those  of  us  from  the  West
Coast have been dealing with this for over 20 years. We have been

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:10 Apr 25, 2005 Jkt 099573 PO 00000 Frm 00087 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\030305\99573 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

84

shouting  and  screaming,  ‘‘It  is  coming.  It  is  coming,’’  and  talking
to my colleagues, district attorneys from the East Coast years ago,
they had no idea what methamphetamine was and possibly shame
on us because we didn’t do a better job. But the good news is, Con-
gressman,  we  are  not  only  dealing  with  the  cobwebs,  but  we  are
also  dealing  with  the  spider  on  the  West  Coast.  Labs  are  down.
There  has  been  a  tremendous  decrease  in  not  only  super  labs  but
small, toxic labs. We are getting much smarter. We are working to-
gether, as Congressman Reichert—Sheriff Reichert said with teams
and  bringing  people  together.  But  in  some  states,  labs  are  going
through  the  roof.  And  we  need  to  take  what  we  have  learned  in
California and Nevada and Utah and Oregon and Washington and
get  with  our  brothers  and  sisters  on  the  East  Coast  to  help.  And
we are doing that.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  The  wind  blows  from  west  to  east,  and  many  of
our  national  problems  seem  to  come  from  west  to  east,  don’t  they?

Thank you very much.
Mr. BURNS. Thank you.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
Mr. Carnahan, talk about middle America.
Mr. CARNAHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member

Gordon.

Yeah, I am from the State of Missouri, and we have the unfortu-
nate distinction of being at the top of the problem. That is not what
we  want  to  be  known  for.  But  thank  you  for  being  here  and  for
your time and your expertise today.

I  wanted  to  start  by  asking  that  law  enforcement,  and  Sheriff,
maybe  I  will  direct  this  to  you,  but  with  the  statistics  that  you
mentioned that 50 percent of law enforcement are often affected by
health  issues  when  they  have  been  exposed  to  these  labs  and  that
we don’t know enough about the health impacts and we really don’t
have  a  set  standard,  what  guideline  or  standard  do  you  see  in  use
in  law  enforcement  now  to  protect  law  enforcement  when  they  are
subject to exposure?

Mr.  HOWARD.  Well,  we  take  all  steps  when  we  take  a  lab  down.
We  don’t  take  any  chances.  In  the  beginning,  as  I  said  earlier,  we
took  some  chances  and  got  educated  very  fast.  And  I  have  to  refer
this  to  Dr.  Martyny.  He  was  the  one  about  the  50  percent  of  law
enforcement  officers  being  overcome  by  fumes  or  being  hurt.  But
we  have,  to  this  point,  have  not  had  any  officers  suffer  any  type
of injuries because of the chemicals or anything because of the pre-
cautions  we  have  taken.  We  do  not  take  any  chances.  And  if  there
is  any  member  of  the  team  who  thinks  they  are  going  to  take  a
chance  are  immediately  removed.  We  do  not  put  up  with  any  of
that. There are serious consequences of going in without protection
on.  As  we  have  seen  on  the  video  clip,  it  is  very  dangerous.  So  we
take every precaution we can take or we won’t go in. It is as simple
as that.

Mr. CARNAHAN. Thank you.
I  also  wanted  to  follow  up  on  the  issue  of  cost  in  terms  of  what
communities  and  law  enforcement  are  having  to  bear.  Do  you  see
around  the  country  much  use  of  additional  financial  penalties  or
property  forfeitures  from  property  that  is  involved?  And  is  that

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:10 Apr 25, 2005 Jkt 099573 PO 00000 Frm 00088 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\030305\99573 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

85

being  put  back  into  the  law  enforcement  to  help  out—to  help  with
the cost of the problem?

Ms.  GREEN.  Congressman,  based  on  what  we  are  seeing,  yes.
What is happening now is they are attempting to seize and forward
some  of  the  properties,  use  the  proceeds,  and  that  would  go  back
into  law  enforcement.  They  are  creating  specified  penalties,  and
then  that  would  go  into  particular  earmark  funds  at  times  with
that  money  being  able  to  go  back  to  law  enforcement.  Even  so,
what  I  would  say  is,  based  on  what  we  are  seeing,  given  the  pace
at  which  the  labs  are  multiplying,  most  of  the  state  resources  are
still  being  drained  in  the  direction  of  dealing  with  meth  labs.  So
they  are  attempting  to  use  those  mechanisms  to  the  extent  they
can, but it is still insufficient at this point.

Mr.  HAMILTON.  Congressman,  just  to  add  to  that,  in  usual  law
enforcement  situations  where  you  seize  property  that  was  either
used  in  the  commission  of  a  crime  or  was  the—or  was  otherwise
connected  with  the  crime,  you  are  seizing  an  asset,  which  does
have  some  financial  value  to  it.  One  of  the  problems  that  we  are
finding is that to seize a—what was the site of a meth lab, whether
it  was  a  residence  or  a  garage  or  a  motor  vehicle,  because  of  the
contamination  and  the  deadly  contamination  associated  with  that
building or that vehicle, it no longer has financial worth associated
with it. And in fact, in some instances, it is estimated that the cost
of  decontamination  or  cleaning  up  the  residence  may  exceed  what
would have been the normal market value of the property. So it is
another  one  of  the  anomalies  that  comes  into  play  when  you  are
dealing with these clan labs.

Mr.  CARNAHAN.  And  finally,  Dr.  Bell,  you  had  mentioned  that
you  had  done—had  some  preliminary  findings  with  your  research,
and I wonder if you could briefly describe what those were?

Dr. BELL. Which research, sir?
Mr.  CARNAHAN.  With  regard  to—I  thought  you  were  describing

with regard to health impact to people that were exposed.

Dr.  BELL.  The  studies  that  we  have  been  involved  in  have  been
more the psychological and learning disabilities impact. And again,
they are very preliminary. But some of the areas that we are inter-
ested in and our district attorney and emergency services personnel
have  worked  with  us  on  these,  when  you  get  a  very  young  child
who  is  in  the  lab  at  the  point  that  the  team  moves  in,  their  first
confrontation is with a group of armed individuals who are dressed
in  either  SWAT  or  HAZMAT  suits.  They  appear  to  feel  like  they
have  been  attacked.  They  are  immediately  stripped  of  all  of  their
clothing,  and  they  are  put,  Congressman  Gordon  mentioned  the
bunny suit, in counties where there is planning and resources, that
is  true,  but  in  other  counties,  they  are  simply  wrapped  up  in  a
space  blanket  or  some  kind  of  an  aluminum  foil  and  taken  to  an
emergency  room  where  they  know  no  one,  et  cetera.  The  effect  in
the short term is traumatic. What we are unclear of, at this point,
is  what  the  long-term  effect  is.  Clearly,  there  are  biochemical  ef-
fects  that  have  the  potential  for  dramatic  learning  disabilities.  So
there  is  some  psychological  short-term  effect.  Some  of  our  data  in-
dicates  that  may  go  away  within  a  few  months,  especially  among
younger  children.  But  the  learning  disabilities  and  the  other  ad-
verse  effects,  like  asthma  and  breathing  problems,  obviously  are

86

going  to  affect  that  child  for  many,  many  years.  Our  data  is  very
preliminary, so we are dealing with a one-county school system and
a  very  small  sample.  And  as  Congressman  Davis  said,  more  re-
sources will help us address larger populations.

Mr. CARNAHAN. Thank you. And thank you all for being here.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Ms. Jackson Lee.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Let me

thank both you and the Ranking Member for this hearing.

And  let  me  also  thank  the  Ranking  Member  for  the  initiative  of

this legislation, which I was delighted to be a co-sponsor.

Texas is a large state, but—we are large, but we are not without
impact of meth labs. And I just site, for the record, that as of Feb-
ruary  24,  2005,  the  State  of  Texas  recorded  422  incidents  related
to meth labs, and that may mean explosions or other incidents that
the cooks cook up, if you will. And we know that nationwide, there
are 16,326 incidents. So we might say that we are long overdue in
sort of getting our hands around this in a national manner.

And I would pose two questions, and I thank you for your indul-
gence.  We  are  in  several  hearings  that  are  occurring  at  once,  but
I thought that this was such an important first start, and this leg-
islation,  I  hope,  will  move  very  quickly,  because  I  am  very  inter-
ested  in  the  local  and  federal  collaboration  that  I  think  is  impor-
tant in any fight against the proliferation of drugs of any kind.

Just  a  few  years  ago,  I  passed  the  date  rape  drug,  that  is  GHB,
that  people  were  making  in  bathtubs.  And  I  am  sure  that  law  en-
forcement  and  others  came  across  this  industry  of  young  people—
even  the  formulas  were  on  the  Internet,  a  new,  sophisticated  use
of the Internet.

Let  me  ask  just  two  specific  questions.  And  Ms.  Green,  if  you
would  tell  me—I  chair,  also,  the  Congressional  Children’s  Caucus
and  am  interested  in  the  negative  impact  on  children.  One,  these
are  homes,  mostly.  Sometimes  the  homes  are  sold.  Is—the  legisla-
tion that we are looking at today, can it actually save lives?

Ms.  GREEN.  I  believe  so,  Congresswoman,  because  what  is  un-
known  now  about  the  research  is  exactly  what  effects  is  the  expo-
sure having on children. Without that knowledge, it means that we
don’t know what protocols we should be using to address the poten-
tial problems, the immediate problems of the child, but also poten-
tial  problems  in  the  future.  And  I  think  with  this  type  of  bill,  the
research first, but also the ability of this mechanism to disseminate
the information to decision-makers throughout the country will en-
sure  that  the  proper  protocols  are  developed  so  that  the  children
can  be  adequately  taken  care  of  in  the  immediate,  but  also
throughout their lives to address whatever potential long-term con-
sequences they might be suffering as a result of the exposure.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. I think if there is a bottom-line crux or anchor
or  mantle  for  this  hearing  it  is  that  this  legislation  can  save  lives.
We  are  now  looking  at  the  aftereffects  of  the  firefighters,  first  re-
sponders,  and  others  who  went  into  the  building,  fought  the  fires
of  9/11.  We  will  probably  look  at  that,  beyond  the  tragedy  of  those
who  lost  their  lives,  those  who  now  live  with  that  ailment,  if  you
will,  of  having  gone  in  with  those  kinds  of  fumes  or  chemicals
meshed  together.  So  I  think  the  question  of  saving  lives  is  crucial,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:10 Apr 25, 2005 Jkt 099573 PO 00000 Frm 00090 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\030305\99573 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

87

and  in—particularly  in  science,  good  sciences,  it  is  important,  but
the good science that leads to saving lives.

I would also like to ask Dr. Martyny, who mentioned the lack of
guidelines  for—and  forgive  me  if  I  was  out  at  another  hearing
when  this  was  discussed,  on  first  responder  equipment.  What  do
we  know  about  this?  Both  law  enforcement,  meaning  police  on  the
police  side,  but  our  firefighters,  what  do  we  know  about  the  lack
of  guidelines  or  how  quickly  we  need  to  move  toward  providing
some answers for that to ensure safety on that aspect as well?

Dr.  MARTYNY.  You  know,  I  think  we  have  made  huge  strides  in
the  last,  maybe,  one  or  two  years.  I  think,  as  the  Sheriff  men-
tioned,  we  have—most  law  enforcement  agencies  nowadays  are
sending people in with self-contained breathing apparatus and good
clothing,  good  protective  to  make  sure,  number  one,  that  they
aren’t  injured.  Number  two,  another  factor  that  we  are  concerned
about  is  them  getting  contaminated  and  them  bringing  the  con-
tamination  home  to  their  families.  So  we  are  interested  in  both  of
those.  DEA  has  been  really  good  at  training  a  lot  of  these  officers,
and  I  think  we  are  going  to  get  better  and  better.  We  still  have—
are still trying to get the word out. And the more training and edu-
cation  we  can  do,  the  better  off  we  are,  but  we  have  moved  a  long
ways  in  a  short  period  of  time,  and  I  think  we  will  continue  to
move.

Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  Well,  I  will  just  conclude  my  questioning.  I
thank  all  of  the  panelists,  and  your  testimony  will  be  well  re-
viewed, and I—my lack of questioning is not out of a lack of appre-
ciation  for  your  statements,  but  I  just  want  to  emphasize  that  one
element  of  this  bill  does  require  a  study  by  the  National  Academy
of  Science  on  the  long-term  health  impacts  of  children  taken  from
meth  labs,  again  usually  homes,  and  also  on  first  responders.  And
I would like for this committee to monitor the progress being made
on  the  guidelines  and  usage  of  better  equipment  for  first  respond-
ers of all kinds, because I think your point is very well taken.

I thank the Chairman, and I yield back my time.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  And  I  thank  the  gentlelady  for  her  inter-
vention.  And  as  you  can  gather  from  what  Ms.  Jackson  Lee  said
and what has been said by many of our panel members previously,
this is a subject of great concern. It is growing, and we want to con-
tain  it,  but  more  importantly,  we  want  to  learn  how  to  respond  to
it  in  an  appropriate  manner  to  protect  all  of  those  innocents  out
there who are just so vulnerable.

I want to thank all of you for being facilitators for this committee

as we go about our business. Thank you very much.

[Whereupon, at 12:15 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF H.R. 798,

METHAMPHETAMINE REMEDIATION RESEARCH ACT OF 2005

Section 1. Short title.

The Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2005

Section 2. Findings.
Section  3.  Voluntary  Guidelines.  Requires  the  Assistant  Administrator  for
Research and Development at the EPA (EPA), in consultation with
the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST),  to  es-
tablish within one year voluntary guidelines for the remediation of
former  methamphetamine  labs,  including  preliminary  site  assess-
ments and the remediation of residual contaminants.

Requires  the  Assistant  Administrator  to  consider  relevant  standards,  guidelines
and requirements in federal, State and local laws and regulations, the varying types
and  locations  of  former  methamphetamine  labs,  and  the  expected  cost  of  carrying
out any proposed guidelines in developing the guidelines.

States  that  the  voluntary  guidelines  are  to  be  used  to  assist  State  and  local  gov-
ernments  in  the  development  and  implementation  of  legislation  and  other  policies
to  apply  state-of-the-art  knowledge  to  the  remediation  of  former  labs.  Requires  the
Assistant  Administrator  to  work  with  State  and  local  governments  and  other  rel-
evant  nonfederal  agencies  and  organizations,  including  through  the  conference  in
section  5,  to  promote  and  encourage  the  appropriate  adoption  of  the  voluntary
guidelines.

Requires  the  Assistant  Administrator  to  periodically  update  the  voluntary  guide-
lines, in consultation with states and other interested parties, as necessary and ap-
propriate to incorporate research findings and other new knowledge.
Section 4. Research Program.

Requires  the  Assistant  Administrator  to  establish  a  program  of  research  to  sup-
port the development and revision of the voluntary guidelines in section 3. Requires
research  to  identify  methamphetamine  laboratory-related  chemicals  of  concern,  as-
sess  the  types  and  levels  of  exposure  to  chemicals  of  concern  that  may  present  a
significant  risk  of  adverse  biological  effects,  better  address  biological  effects  and
minimize  adverse  human  exposures,  evaluate  the  performance  of  various  meth-
amphetamine  laboratory  cleanup  and  remediation  techniques,  and  support  other
priorities, identified by the Assistant Administrator in consultation with states and
others.
Section 5. Technology Transfer Conference.

Requires  the  Assistant  Administrator  to  convene  within  90  days  and  every  third
year  thereafter  a  conference  of  State  agencies  and  other  individuals  and  organiza-
tions  involved  with  the  impacts  of  former  methamphetamine  laboratories.  States
that  the  conference  should  be  a  forum  for  the  Assistant  Administrator  to  provide
information on the voluntary guidelines and the latest findings of the research pro-
gram as well as an opportunity for the non-federal participants to provide informa-
tion on their problems, needs and experiences with the voluntary guidelines.

Requires  the  Assistant  Administrator  within  three  months  to  submit  a  report  to
Congress  that  summarizes  the  proceedings  of  the  conference,  including  any  rec-
ommendations  or  concern  raised  and  a  description  of  how  the  Assistant  Adminis-
trator  intends  to  respond  to  them.  Requires  the  report  to  be  made  widely  available
to the general public.
Section 6. Residual Effects Study.

Requires  the  Assistant  Administrator  to  enter  into  an  arrangement  with  the  Na-
tional  Academy  of  Science  within  six  months  to  study  the  status  and  quality  of  re-
search on the residual effects of methamphetamine laboratories. Requires the study
to  identify  research  gaps  and  recommend  an  agenda  for  the  research  program  in
section  4.  Requires  the  study  to  focus  on  the  need  for  research  on  the  impact  of
methamphetamine  laboratories  on  residents  of  buildings  where  labs  are  or  where
located,  with  particular  emphasis  on  the  biological  effects  on  children  and  on  first
responders.
Section  7.  Methamphetamine  Detection  Research  and  Development  Pro-

gram.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL MULTI HOUSING COUNCIL/NATIONAL

APARTMENT ASSOCIATION JOINT LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM

Chairman  Boehlert,  Ranking  Member  Gordon,  and  distinguished  Members  of  the
Science  Committee,  the  National  Multi  Housing  Council  (NMHC)  and  the  National
Apartment Association (NAA) appreciate the opportunity to share the views of rent-
al housing providers as the Committee considers the Methamphetamine Remediation
Research Act of 2005. The National Multi Housing Council and the National Apart-
ment  Association  represent  the  Nation’s  leading  firms  participating  in  the  apart-
ment industry and are committed to providing safe, affordable, and accessible home
choices for the 21 percent of all households who live in apartment homes.

NMHC’s membership includes the principal officers of the largest and most promi-
nent  apartment  owners,  developers,  managers  and  lenders.  NAA  is  the  largest  na-
tional  federation  of  state  and  local  apartment  associations  with  164  affiliates  and
31,000  professionals  who  own  and  manage  more  than  five  million  apartments.
NMHC and NAA jointly operate a federal legislative program and provide a unified
voice for the private apartment industry.

The manufacture of illicit methamphetamine (meth) in makeshift, clandestine lab-
oratories is a growing concern throughout the United States. In the production proc-
ess,  manufacturers  utilize  various  volatile  and  highly  toxic  chemicals,  resulting  in
an  acute  risk  of  poisoning,  fire  and  explosion.  Moreover,  these  labs  may  pose  a
health  and  safety  threat  after  drug  production  ceases,  due  to  the  presence  of  haz-
ardous manufacturing byproducts and residual production chemicals, if cleanup has
not been done properly.

Given the mobility and small size of illegal drug laboratories, they can be located
on  any  type  of  property  and  pose  considerable  challenges  for  any  property  owner.
However, they are particularly problematic when located in residential, rental prop-
erties. In addition to the risk of fire and explosion, the chemical residue left behind
by  these  labs  may  present  a  hazard  to  residents.  More  research  is  necessary  to
evaluate the efficacy of remediation techniques for the indoor environment following
its contamination with methamphetamine or the byproducts of its production.

There  is  a  widespread  understanding  in  the  commercial  real  estate  industry  that
an  identified,  illegal  drug  laboratory  must  be  reported  to  the  appropriate  law  en-
forcement  authorities.  Typically,  law  enforcement  officials  will  confiscate  or  dispose
of all drug-manufacturing equipment and chemicals found at the site, but after this
bulk  cleanup  is  completed,  the  property  owners  face  the  daunting  task  of  dealing
with  any  residual  contamination.  This  is  complicated  by  the  fact  that  there  are
many unsettled questions regarding appropriate clean up and restoration of affected
properties.
Property remediation standards are necessary.

Since there is a lack of consensus about how to proceed once the crime scene tape
has  come  down,  many  property  owners  are  questioning  what,  if  any,  additional
cleanup  needs  to  be  done  to  safeguard  the  health  and  safety  of  their  maintenance
workers  and  residents.  Recently,  several  states  have  enacted  mandatory  cleanup
statutes;  however,  there  are  no  federal  guidelines  or  standards  addressing  remedi-
ation  of  meth-contaminated  properties,  and,  with  few  exceptions,  even  the  states
with  mandatory  cleanup  laws  have  failed  to  define  levels  of  contamination  and  ap-
propriate  abatement  methods.  Those  cleanup  guidelines  that  do  exist  acknowledge
that the residual health effects and safe contamination levels of meth-related chemi-
cals  are  largely  unknown,  which  means  these  standards  are  conservative  and  not
directly related to scientific or medical findings.

The lack of scientific evidence or national property remediation standards has re-
sulted  in  widely  divergent  state-required  cleanup  practices  and  requirements.  Cur-
rently,  ‘‘safe’’  meth  contamination  levels  range  from  0.5  µg/ft2 to  0.05  µg/100  cm2.
Additionally,  some  states’  standards  only  address  the  residual  methamphetamine
level itself, while others establish acceptable levels for meth-related chemicals, such
as mercury, lead, volatile organic chemicals and corrosives. Finally, some states re-
quire cleanup to be completed by a state licensed or otherwise certified remediation
professional, while others do not.

This  has  created  tremendous  uncertainty  and  confusion  for  property  owners  try-
ing  to  determine  the  best  practices  for  successful  decontamination  as  well  as  their
responsibilities under these new and emerging laws. It has also subjected apartment
owners  and  operators  to  malicious  or  negligent  mistreatment  by  remediation  con-
tractors,  who  may  recommend  a  variety  of  unproven,  unnecessary  or  costly  decon-
tamination strategies.

We strongly support the provision of H.R. 798 that directs the U.S. Environmental
Protection  Agency  to  develop  remediation  guidelines  in  cooperation  with  the  Na-

tional  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology.  Since  safe  and  technically  sound
guidelines  are  fundamental,  we  question,  however,  the  notion  that  those  guidelines
should be voluntary, rather than mandatory. Mandatory guidelines could be revised
in light of applicable technological developments.
Research  on  potential  health  effect  of  residual  chemical  exposure  is  nec-

essary.

Given  the  disparities  in  cleanup  protocols,  property  owners  are  also  concerned
about the potential liability associated with any residual contaminants. Accordingly,
we  strongly  support  the  provision  of  H.R.  798  that  directs  the  National  Academy
of  Sciences  to  undertake  a  study  to  determine  what  is  known  regarding  the  poten-
tial health effects of contaminants resulting from methamphetamine laboratories.
Improved methods of detection are essential.

Property  owners  may  not  be  aware  that  an  illegal  drug  laboratory  has  operated
on their property. Clandestine meth laboratories are highly mobile, and manufactur-
ers  are  learning  to  hide  the  tell  tale  signs  of  meth  production  through  various
means,  such  as  using  new  and  reportedly,  odorless  processes.  Since  meth  contami-
nation may be imperceptible to the naked eye, there is an essential need for reliable
rapid  detection  protocols.  Although  private  vendors  are  currently  marketing  such
tests,  validation  of  these  devices  and  improved  accuracy  of  testing  methods  in  gen-
eral is currently an unmet need.

Health and safety concerns have motivated several states to enact notice and dis-
closure  laws  requiring  full  disclosure  of  a  properties’  use  as  a  clandestine  meth-
amphetamine lab to all prospective buyers or residents. Typically, disclosure is only
required while a property is in fact ‘‘contaminated.’’ However, due to the uncertain-
ties inherent in current decontamination practices, some states have enacted stricter
laws requiring disclosure even after the property has been decontaminated. Requir-
ing  disclosure  of  contamination  that  has  been  appropriately  remediated  unfairly
stigmatizes  and  devalues  the  property  and  will  ultimately  serve  to  exacerbate  the
existing shortage of affordable housing.

Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  develop  cleanup  guidelines  and  standardized  decon-
tamination practices for meth labs, and establish guidelines for the training and cer-
tification  of  decontamination  professionals.  This  will  protect  property  owners,  resi-
dents, and remediation professionals by providing a clear foundation for the remedi-
ation  of  affected  properties.  This  will  also  provide  the  public  with  much  needed  in-
formation about meth-related environmental exposures.

This legislation takes a crucial first step towards achieving this goal. Research is
fundamental  to  the  establishment  of  effective,  health-based  cleanup  standards.  It
will provide insight regarding safe exposure levels to meth-related chemicals, appro-
priate  testing  methods,  and  decontamination  safety  and  best  practices.  This  infor-
mation will aid property owners in their continued efforts to protect the health and
safety of all residents, employees, and visitors.

In  summary,  NMHC/NAA  support  H.R.  798  because  it  (1)  directs  research  to  de-
termine  effective  means  of  decommissioning  meth  labs  on  residential  property,  (2)
requires  federal  authorities  to  establish  threshold  levels  of  contamination  that  pro-
tect the public health, and (3) funds the development of rapid detection methods so
we  can  monitor  our  indoor  environments.  In  addition,  we  support  the  certification
of trained individuals to remediate meth labs. After following the guidance of these
trained professionals in remediating the property, the property should be by defini-
tion  ‘‘safe;’’  therefore,  disclosure  of  the  former  presence  of  the  illegal  lab  should  not
be required.

Thank you for your consideration of these points.
