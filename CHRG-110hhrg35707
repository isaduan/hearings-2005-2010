HEARING CHARTER

SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

The Status Report on the
NPOESS Weather Satellite

Program

THURSDAY, JUNE 7, 2007

1:00 P.M.–3:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

The  Subcommittee  on  Energy  and  Environment  meets  on  June  7,  2007,  to  con-
tinue oversight on the unsettled National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental
Satellite  System  (NPOESS).  The  Government  Accountability  Office  (GAO)  will  re-
lease the latest report on this critical weather monitoring platform requested by the
Subcommittee,  and  the  Program  Executive  Officer  for  NPOESS  will  respond  to  the
findings  and  recommendations.  Additionally,  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Science
and Technology Policy (OSTP) will respond to questions about the status of sensors
for  tracking  climate  and  so-called  ‘‘space  weather’’  phenomena  that  were  removed
during the recent program restructuring.
Witnesses
Mr.  David  Powner,  Director,  Information  Technology  Management  Issues,
Government  Accountability  Office:  Mr.  Powner  is  the  head  of  the  GAO  team
continuously monitoring the NPOESS program since 2001. He will present their lat-
est  report  that  discusses  the  effort  to  strengthen  the  management  of  the  NPOESS
program  and  evaluates  the  realistic  cost  estimate  for  the  revised  program.  The  re-
port also examines the continuing risks that challenge the execution of the program.
Brigadier General Sue Mashiko, USAF; Program Executive Officer for Envi-
ronmental Monitoring: General Mashiko has been in the post of Program Execu-
tive Officer for the NPOESS program since November 2005. The position was estab-
lished in the wake of the program’s restructuring to evaluate the performance of the
Integrated Program Office (IPO) handling the system acquisition and to serve as the
arbiter  for  awarding  performance  incentives  to  Northrop  Grumman,  the  program’s
contractor.  General  Mashiko  also  took  on  the  responsibility  for  external  relations
with  the  Executive  Committee  comprising  the  heads  of  the  three  agencies  (NOAA,
the Air Force and NASA) contributing to the program.
Hon.  John  Marburger,  III,  Director,  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Pol-
icy: OSTP has been managing reviews by NASA and NOAA of the sensors removed
from  NPOESS  to  identify  other  ways  to  fly  the  instruments  and  maintain  the  data
sets.  Dr.  Marburger  will  discuss  the  process  involved  in  these  reviews,  the  results
to  date,  and  how  these  reviews  will  determine  the  alternative  plan  for  preserving
climate and space weather observations.

Background
A Short History of NPOESS

For  decades,  the  United  States  has  maintained  satellites  in  orbit,  looking  down
at  Earth  and  gathering  information  that  allows  us  to  track  and  forecast  weather.
These  satellites  operated  in  both  geostationary  orbit  (where  they  move  fast  enough
to keep pace with Earth’s rotation, thus staying in the same place above the equator
and seeing an entire hemisphere at once) and in polar orbits (allowing them to pass
over all points on Earth as the planet rotated underneath). Both the Air Force and
NOAA  were  operating  polar  satellites  to  satisfy  their  diverse  user  needs.  In  1993,
the decision was made to combine both programs into a single system, and thus the
National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) was
born.

In 2000, the NPOESS program anticipated purchasing six satellites for $6.5 bil-
lion,  with  a  first  launch  in  2008.  Following  financial  problems,  a  new  program
baseline  was  issued  in  2004,  which  raised  the  expected  acquisition  cost  to  $7.4
billion.  By  November  2005,  the  program  office  determined  that  it  was  likely  that
NPOESS  would  run  over  that  estimate  by  at  least  25  percent,  which  triggered  the
Nunn-McCurdy review by the Department of Defense. In order to continue the pro-
gram, it was necessary to report to Congress that:

• The program is essential to national security;
• No  alternative  program  provides  the  same  or  improved  military  capability  at

lower cost;

• The new cost estimates are reasonable; and
• The program’s management is adequate to manage and control costs.

The  NPOESS  Program  was  recertified  on  June  5,  2006,  but  there  were  some  sig-
nificant changes. The estimate for acquisition cost rose to $11.5 billion (and, as
GAO  notes  in  its  report,  there  is  an  additional  $1  billion  to  cover  operating  costs,
making the total life cycle cost $12.5 billion). Only four satellites will be built,
with  the  first  launch  now  scheduled  for  2013.  A  major  sensor,  the  Conical
Microwave  Imaging  Sounder  (CMIS),  was  removed  because  it  seemed  unlikely  that
the  technical  issues  in  its  design  and  construction  could  be  overcome.  A  new  com-
petition is to be conducted for an instrument whose capabilities will fall much closer
to existing technology. The U.S. would fly satellites in only two, not three, polar or-
bits;  data  from  the  third  orbit  would  now  be  the  responsibility  of  European  sat-
ellites.

The other major decision was to remove several sensors. Some would focus on the
study  of  Earth’s  climate.  Others  monitor  phenomena  generated  by  the  Sun  that  af-
fect  the  Earth’s  magnetic  field  and  can  play  havoc  with  power  lines,  airline  flights
over  the  polar  regions  and  satellites.  Scientists  studying  climate  were  particularly
concerned. Detecting the small changes in the ocean and atmosphere that signal cli-
mate changes is critically dependent on data collections that cover decades in time.
Without the climate sensors on NPOESS, some of the most basic climate data would
no longer be available. This has been the focus of articles that appeared in the last
day  regarding  the  NPOESS  program  and  the  loss  of  climate  sensors  from  the  sat-
ellites.

Central  to  the  persistent  problems  in  the  NPOESS  programs  are  the  major  sen-
sors and the program’s management. The cancellation of CMIS came about because
the weight and size kept growing as the Boeing instrument team struggled to meet
Army requirements for determining soil moisture. Even worse was the Visible/Infra-
red Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), where sub-component deliveries were behind
schedule, testing of various items was harder and took longer than expected, ground
support equipment was not working properly, and independent reviews of Raytheon
management resulted in removal of the entire instrument management team. VIIRS
is  the  primary  instrument  on  NPOESS;  it  will  contribute  data  to  more  of  the  ex-
pected products than any other sensor. The Integrated Program Office, lacking suffi-
cient  reserves,  attempted  to  deal  with  the  problems  by  redeploying  resources  from
the  other  instrument  contracts,  upsetting  their  performance.  Last  year,  the  Cross-
Track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) suffered a broken frame during its vibration testing.
The  program  has  since  been  checking  the  various  pieces  of  the  test  instrument  to
learn if they can still be used. NPOESS managers believe that the second frame can
be substituted for the first, minimizing disruption to the program.

The  Committee’s  hearing  in  November  2005  on  the  NPOESS  program  examined
the  poor  performance  of  NPOESS  management  levels.  This  extended  all  the  way
from  subcontractors  (as  noted  in  the  case  of  VIIRS)  to  the  Executive  Committee
(EXCOM), which comprises senior leaders of the three agencies involved in the pro-
gram. Members questioned why the EXCOM failed to meet as the NPOESS program
spiraled  further  into  crisis.  Repeated  analysis  of  alternatives  often  substituted  for
decisions. By August 2005, the head of NOAA declared he had no confidence in the
information  being  reported  by  the  Integrated  Program  Office.  Part  of  the  program
change  instituted  by  the  Nunn-McCurdy  process  was  the  redesign  of  the  manage-
ment structure. General Mashiko became responsible for seeking direction from the
EXCOM and assuring that those decisions were executed by the IPO. The IPO also
began hiring the technical and managerial talent needed to fill the many gaps that
left  it  unaware  of  problems  or  unable  to  respond  to  them.  The  EXCOM  has  been
holding  quarterly  meetings  on  the  program.  For  the  moment,  at  least,  turmoil  in
the  management  suites  is  not  a  primary  contributor  to  risk  in  the  NPOESS  pro-
gram.

Climate Change Science and the White Paper on De-manifested Sensors

5

NPOESS satellites, as originally designed, were to do more than support weather
forecasting  needs  for  NOAA  and  the  military  services.  Sensors  were  also  included
to expand the type of climate data being collected by NASA’s Earth Observing Sys-
tem  satellites,  and  to  provide  insight  into  the  effects  on  Earth’s  environment  from
solar  activity.  These  sensors  were  removed  in  the  Nunn-McCurdy  process.  The  loss
of  these  sensors  was  met  with  dismay  among  the  affected  user  communities.  The
National  Research  Council,  which  was  completing  its  first  Earth  science  decadal
survey,  recommended  immediate  efforts  to  restore  some  of  the  sensors  to  NPOESS.
On  June  26,  2006,  OSTP  met  with  NASA  and  NOAA  to  discuss  a  response.  NASA
agreed to develop an analysis of the consequences of the removal of climate sensors.
NASA issued its first draft on August 15, 2006. NOAA added its contributions in
drafts  that  were  completed  in  December  2006.  The  final  version  of  the  white  paper
was delivered to OSTP on January 8, 2007.

In  the  paper,  NASA  and  NOAA  conclude  that,  ‘‘Unfortunately,  the  recent  loss  of
climate sensors due to the NPOESS Nunn-McCurdy Certification places the overall
climate  program  in  serious  jeopardy.’’  In  the  August  15  draft,  NASA  devised  a  set
of  recommended  actions  for  the  canceled  sensors.  The  main  difference  between  the
first draft and final version was the development of a priority listing.

The  white  paper  lists  its  first  priorities  as  the  Total  Solar  Irradiance  Sensor
(TSIS)  and  the  Earth  Radiation  Budget  Sensor  (ERBS).  Together,  these  sensors
track  the  amount  of  energy  the  Sun  imparts  to  the  Earth,  and  how  much  of  that
energy the Earth reflects from its surface, clouds and what is not absorbed by green-
house  gases.  The  difference  between  the  values  reported  by  these  two  sensors  is  a
critical starting point for evaluating climate effects. TSIS data extends back over 28
years, and any loss would disrupt our understanding of the ‘‘dominant, direct energy
input into terrestrial ecosystems.’’

NASA  will  fly  part  of  the  TSIS  instrument  on  its  Glory  mission,  currently  sched-
uled to launch in December 2008. It will be a three-year mission, with hopes of two
more  beyond  that.  The  white  paper  recommends  three  TSIS  sensors,  with  the  first
to  be  launched  on  any  available  and  suitable  vehicle  in  time  to  overlap  with  the
Glory  mission.  For  ERBS,  the  possibility  of  a  data  gap  between  the  end  of  the  cur-
rent  Aqua  mission  and  the  launch  of  the  first  NPOESS  mission  leads  to  a  rec-
ommendation  that  the  last  Clouds  and  Earth’s  Radiant  Energy  System  (CERES)
sensor be flown on NPP, rather than wait for NPOESS. ERBS would then be flown
aboard the first and third NPOESS missions. The Decadal Survey agreed that these
sensors  ‘‘should  be  restored  on  NPOESS  or  provided  by  other  means  to  avoid  a
measurement gap in the timeframe 2008 to 2012.’’

Fourth  in  the  white  paper  priority  list  was  the  limb-scattering  component  of  the
Ozone  Monitoring  and  Profiling  Suite  (OMPS–Limb).  The  decision  to  remove  this
particular  sensor  came  at  a  point  where  the  hardware  had  been  completed  and
would  have  required  a  significant  effort  to  decouple  from  the  other  part  of  the  in-
strument.  Since  the  cost  of  completing  the  instrument  was  not  that  much  different
from  removing  it,  the  NPOESS  program  decided  that  a  full  OMPS  should  be  flown
on NPP as originally planned. It remains uncertain if the full OMPS sensor will fly
on NPOESS missions.

Of  concern  as  this  analytical  process  unfolds  is  its  tenuous  integration  with  the
NPOESS program and the possibility that it will be overtaken by events. This first
came  to  the  Committee’s  attention  in  March  when  the  instrument  contractor  indi-
cated  that  if  the  OMPS–Limb  sensor  was  to  be  flown  on  NPP,  a  decision  had  to  be
made by the end of that month to preserve the September 2009 launch date. Senior
Members  of  the  Committee  wrote  to  Dr.  Marburger,  NASA  Administrator  Michael
Griffin, and NOAA Administrator Conrad Lautenbacher to take advantage of the op-
portunity.

Testifying before the Committee a year ago, Admiral Lautenbacher stated:

We  specifically  decided  that  the  NPOESS  spacecraft  will  be  built  with  the  ca-
pacity to house all of the [de-manifested] sensors, and includes funding to inte-
grate  them  on  the  spacecraft.  The  decision  was  made  because  the  EXCOM
agreed  that  any  additional  funding  gain  through  contract  renegotiation  or  in
unutilized management reserve would be considered to procure these secondary
sensors,  in  addition  to  other  organizations  bringing  money  for  these  sensors  to
the table.

Indeed,  the  white  paper  recommends  taking  advantage  of  this  capability.  Yet  the
drafters of the analysis indicated in a briefing to staff on May 17 that they learned
the  NPOESS  program  office  would  not  accept  any  additions  to  the  sensor  com-
plement on the first NPOESS satellite. Indeed, according to a briefing chart for the
March  2,  2007  EXCOM  meeting,  the  ‘‘Lock-Down  Dates  for  integration  of  De-mani-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:15 Jul 23, 2008 Jkt 035707 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\060707\35707 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

6

fested  Sensors’’  on  the  first  satellite  was  already  past.  Yet  the  white  paper  was  de-
livered still recommending efforts to fly some sensors on the 2013 launch.

The EXCOM briefing chart states that ‘‘C–1 requires significant additional devel-
opment, integration and test time for sensors and spacecraft,’’ and General Mashiko
indicates  that  the  NPOESS  program  made  the  decision  to  freeze  the  sensor  com-
plement  to  reduce  risk  of  disruption.  Yet  these  sensors  were  originally  manifested
aboard  the  satellite,  and  as  Admiral  Lautenbacher  testified,  the  program  was  di-
rected to maintain space and funding to accommodate them. The interfaces between
sensors  and  satellite  are  already  included  in  the  requirements  and  specifications.
While space on the first launch is not an issue for TSIS, it was an option for ERBS,
OMPS–Limb and the Advanced Polarimetry Sensor. Is it indeed the case that there
are no chances to fill up some of those available slots aboard the first NPOESS sat-
ellite?

In  contrast  to  the  decision  to  restrict  further  changes  to  the  first  NPOESS  sat-
ellite,  the  decision  to  add  CERES  to  NPP  is  still  open.  Now  just  two  years  from
launch, making yet another change to the complement of instruments raises the risk
calculations.  Arguing  in  favor  of  the  change  is  that  it  would  reduce  the  threat  of
data loss, and that the contractor is willing to offer a fixed-price proposal to do the
job.  The  government  rarely  receives  such  offers  unless  the  bidder  is  truly  confident
that the task is completely understood.

Of  more  immediate  concern  for  TSIS  is  the  possible  loss  of  the  contractor’s  staff
before  the  OSTP  process  reaches  a  conclusion  on  the  sensor.  With  the  decision  to
terminate TSIS, the University of Colorado’s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space
Physics  (LASP)  has  been  dealing  with  the  possibility  that  the  employees  on  the
project  would  disperse.  LASP  has  proposed  a  follow-on  mission  that  would  update
the technology now flying on the SOlar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE)
spacecraft  with  TSIS.  This  would  bridge  the  gap  between  Glory  and  another  TSIS
that  would  be  placed  aboard  the  second  NPOESS  satellite  in  2016.  This  would  be
consistent  with  the  white  paper’s  recommendation,  but  hard  to  execute  if  the  sen-
sor’s builders have gone on to new jobs.

A  similar  situation  may  exist  in  the  sensor  for  monitoring  the  effects  from  solar
flares  and  coronal  mass  ejections—so-called  ‘‘space  weather’’  phenomena.  Power
companies, airlines and satellite operators have all discovered in recent decades that
the  energetic  particles  and  plasmas  can  disrupt  critical  infrastructures  or  increase
their costs. NOAA’s ability to provide early warning of these events, particularly as
the  Sun  enters  the  more  active  phases  of  its  11-year  cycle,  has  been  improving  in
tandem with higher-capability sensors.

NPOESS was slated to carry the Space Environment Sensor Suite (SESS), a com-
bination  of  five  types  of  instruments  that  collected  data  on  different  aspects  of  the
particles and fields involved in space weather. As a result of the Nunn-McCurdy de-
cision, these were replaced with the Space Environment Monitor (SEM) instrument
now  aboard  existing  satellites.  One  of  these  instruments  is  the  Thermal  Plasma
Sensor (TPS). It was designed to provide data on the geomagnetic and electric fields
and  plasma  temperatures  and  fluctuations  during  solar  events.  With  such  informa-
tion,  the  Air  Force  could  quickly  evaluate  the  loss  of  function  in  their  satellites  to
determine if it was the result of a natural event or some adversary’s action. In times
of  crisis,  this  would  be  an  extremely  time-critical  analysis.  Massive  events  in  Octo-
ber  and  November  of  2003  and  again  in  December  2006  affected  oil  drilling  in  the
Gulf of Mexico as the GPS signals that precisely locate drilling platforms above the
tangle of sea floor pipelines were lost for up to fifteen minutes.

The United States has only one manufacturer for TPS sensors, a university group
at  the  University  of  Texas  at  Dallas  (UTD).  The  university  anticipates  that  the
group  will  disband  as  there  is  no  other  existing  requirement  for  these  detectors.
Some  of  the  UTD  groups  are  expected  to  retire  and  the  lack  of  interesting  projects
is  likely  to  cause  the  remainder  of  the  team  to  seek  other  opportunities.  The  SEM
package will not meet the requirements assigned to the TPS sensor, and yet we may
lose  the  capability  to  obtain  such  instruments  in  the  next  few  months.  OSTP  only
initiated the effort to conduct an analysis of the Nunn-McCurdy impact on the space
environment sensors in February, and there is nothing similar to the climate sensor
white paper yet available.

In  its  original  white  paper  draft  last  August,  NASA  stated,  ‘‘The  budgets  and
schedules  associated  with  these  recommendations  will  be  incorporated  in  a  subse-
quent  draft  of  this  white  paper  to  be  available  in  approximately  one  month.’’  Staff
was told in the May 17 meeting that the authors ‘‘were a bit optimistic’’ about their
ability  to  provide  such  information.  A  month  after  the  white  paper  was  delivered,
OSTP asked the agencies to begin a second study that would incorporate budget re-
quirements and alternatives to replacing the sensors on the NPOESS satellites. The
National Research Council was asked to convene an additional panel to provide as-

sistance.  However,  the  agencies  are  not  anticipating  a  final  report  to  OSTP  before
September, and that may only include interim information from the Research Coun-
cil.  While  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  representatives  are  attending  OSTP’s
meetings to obtain updates on the analysis, there does not seem to be any discussion
about required budget actions.

Members of the Decadal Survey recommended that ‘‘OSTP. . .should develop and
implement  a  plan  for  achieving  and  sustaining  global  Earth  observations.’’  This  ex-
perience  raises  the  possibility  that  OSTP  may  not  be  ready  to  take  on  that  more
ambitious task.
GAO’s New Report

The  Committee  first  asked  the  Government  Accountability  Office  to  evaluate  the
NPOESS program in 2002, when concerns about NOAA’s ability to handle the data
volume expected from the satellites was at issue. In 2004, it reported that costs had
jumped  by  $1  billion  and  that  launch  dates  for  the  various  satellites  were  slipping.
In  November  2005,  Mr.  Powner  stated  that  cost  and  schedule  trends  were  con-
tinuing to deteriorate and called NPOESS ‘‘a program in crisis.’’ In this report, GAO
focuses  on  the  state  of  the  NPOESS  program  as  it  starts  to  carry  out  the  decisions
made by the Nunn-McCurdy process.

GAO  notes  that  the  program  managers  have  succeeded  in  imposing  greater  dis-
cipline  on  the  program.  The  program  managed  to  achieve  156  of  166  milestones  in
the  interim  program  plan  for  fiscal  year  2006,  and  has  since  addressed  five  of  the
residual  items.  Through  January  of  2007,  the  program  had  reached  62  of  the  222
milestones  planned  for  fiscal  year  2007—two  more  than  planned.  In  a  briefing  to
staff, Mr. Powner stated that the IPO maintains that NPP will meet its 2009 launch
date and that the program cost estimate remains $12.5 billion. He said, though, that
NPP  will  launch  ‘‘as-is’’  (with  instrument  performance  at  whatever  level  can  be
achieved  by  launch  day)  and  that  there  are  still  cost  pressures  that  may  push  the
estimate above $12.5 billion.
a. Acquisition planning documents

In April, when it delivered its report, GAO noted that major documents necessary
for  the  development  of  program  plans  and  renegotiation  of  the  contract  with  lead
contractor Northrop Grumman are still awaiting approval. These included:

for NOAA, the Air Force and NASA;

• the  reworked  Memorandum  of  Agreement  defining  roles  and  responsibilities
• the system engineering plan;
• the test and evaluation master plan; and
• the acquisition strategy.

According  to  the  decision  memorandum  that  resulted  from  the  Nunn-McCurdy
process, the Memorandum of Agreement should have been completed August 6, 2006
and  the  other  documents  by  September  1,  2006.  These  documents  define  the  rela-
tionships  between  the  Integrated  Program  Office  and  the  agencies  and  lay  out  the
predicted levels of resources in terms of time, money and effort that will be required
to complete the NPOESS program in the wake of the Nunn-McCurdy recertification.
The  information  in  these  documents  will  govern  the  budget  requests  for  NPOESS
from  NOAA,  the  Air  Force  and  NASA  for  years  to  come.  That  it  has  taken  a  year
to  complete  these  items,  even  though  they  should  be  little  more  than  recording  the
hard  choices  already  taken  in  the  Nunn-McCurdy  process,  indicates  that  inter-
agency coordination still serves to weigh down the program.

GAO  recommended  in  the  report  that  the  agencies  have  the  approvals  completed
by  April  30.  Yet  in  meetings  with  the  Committee  staff  May  23  and  25,  both  GAO
and General Mashiko indicated these documents still awaited signature. The agency
comments  included  in  the  report  indicate  that  the  Department  of  Defense’s  process
for  approving  the  interagency  Memorandum  of  Agreement  appears  to  be  the  major
roadblock, as NOAA and NASA could not complete approvals until there was a final
consensus on the text to be approved.

From  General  Mashiko’s  perspective,  some  documents  are  more  important  than
others. She emphasized that the program office prioritized development and comple-
tion  of  the  integrated  master  schedule  and  the  integrated  master  plan.  These,  she
said,  were  the  prime  tools  for  the  program  office’s  day-to-day  activities  and  are  the
primary tools for the government’s control of contractor activities. These documents
are  now  developed  to  a  point  well  beyond  what  the  government  previously  had
available and, according to Colonel David Stockton (the NPOESS Program Director),
give him greater ability to measure actual performance by Northrop Grumman and
the instrument manufacturers. These two documents should be in final form before
completion of the contract renegotiation, because changes after that point will result

8

in contract modifications. Such modifications rarely result in lower costs to the gov-
ernment.
b. Program Office management and staffing

GAO  next  moved  to  a  discussion  of  program  leadership  and  program  office  staff-
ing.  In  July,  General  Mashiko  will  be  transferred  by  the  Air  Force  to  the
MILSATCOM  program.  GAO  recommends  that  the  Air  Force  delay  the  transfer
until  July  2008,  when  all  of  the  instruments  scheduled  to  fly  on  the  NPP  mission
have  been  delivered.  Before  that  point,  GAO  considers  the  increase  in  risk  from
management  disruption  ‘‘unnecessary.’’  That  recommendation  has  been  rejected  by
DOD.

General  Mashiko  stated  to  staff  that  change  in  her  position  is  less  significant  to
progress in NPOESS than would be the case if the System Program Director, Colo-
nel Dan Stockton, was to depart. The EXCOM met May 21 to discuss the transition.
According  to  the  comments  in  the  report,  NOAA  was  expecting  to  supply  the  next
Program  Executive  Officer;  apparently  the  deadline  in  the  position  announcement
had  to  be  extended  two  weeks  to  attract  candidates.  General  Mashiko  indicated
eight  are  now  being  considered.  The  Air  Force  will  supply  a  deputy.  The  intent  is
to  select  the  replacement  quickly  to  allow  as  much  time  as  possible  to  hand  over
responsibilities  and  to  allow  the  new  Executive  Officer  to  participate  in  decision-
making.

GAO  argues  in  its  report  that  management  turnover  is  a  contributing  factor  to
the problems that have disrupted many other Air Force space system procurements.
They  believe  senior  managers  should  serve  until  completion  of  development  or  ac-
tual  delivery  of  their  product,  not  simply  an  arbitrary  period  of  time.  The  former
Chairman and CEO of the Lockheed Martin Corporation, Norm Augustine, wrote in
his  book  Augustine’s  Laws  about  the  problems  that  come  from  ‘‘. . .attempting  to
develop  major  new  systems  with  ten-year  technology,  eight-year  programs,  a  five-
year  plan,  three-year  people,  and  one-year  dollars.’’  GAO  has  lost  the  argument  on
this  recommendation,  but  this  now  becomes  another  issue  that  the  Committee  will
have to watch carefully as the new leadership takes over.

GAO  also  recommended  that  NOAA  needed  to  develop  plans  for  identifying  the
staffing needs in the NPOESS program office and to initiate steps to fill vacant crit-
ical  slots.  The  lack  of  systems  engineering  personnel  and  budget  and  cost  analysts
in  the  Program  Office  has  been  a  consistent  concern  of  independent  reviewers.  As
of  April,  GAO  found  that  five  budget  analyst  positions  and  15  system  engineering
or technical manager positions remained unfilled; 16 were to be provided by NOAA.
That  these  positions  remained  open  a  year  after  the  Nunn-McCurdy  decision  direc-
tive  ordered  expedited  actions  to  fill  vacant  positions  led  GAO  to  express  concern
about the government’s ability to develop an updated cost estimate for renegotiating
the contract with Northrop Grumman or to handle management tasks.

General  Mashiko  stated  in  her  staff  interview  that  staffing  actions  had  acceler-
ated with the hiring of a personnel specialist with the ability to assist division man-
agers in identifying staffing needs. The Program Office also received assistance from
the  human  resource  offices  at  the  three  agencies  to  find  candidates  with  particular
skills and see them assigned to NPOESS positions. General Mashiko indicated that
there  are  now  only  six  of  NOAA’s  16  slots  still  open,  and  those  were  in  various
stages of recruitment. Some positions had to be re-advertised to identify candidates
with  appropriate  skills.  That  NPOESS  is  competing  with  every  other  R&D  agency
in the government for these skill sets also slowed the process.
c. Continuing concerns

As  noted  earlier,  the  sensors  for  NPOESS  remain  the  major  concern  in  success-
fully  executing  both  the  early  NPP  mission  and  the  operational  NPOESS  program.
The VIIRS instrument was the subject of extensive discussion at the EXCOM meet-
ing of March 2, 2007. This so-called ‘‘Gate 8’’ decision required the instrument team
to  demonstrate  that  it  had  addressed  design  issues  and  that  the  instrument  would
perform  as  expected.  According  to  the  briefing  slides,  assuming  that  the  flight  unit
performed  as  well  as  the  current  engineering  development  unit,  the  data  would
meet or exceed what is now provided by existing satellites. However, there was one
issue—‘‘optical  crosstalk’’—that  remained  open.  It  threatened  to  reduce  ocean  color
measurements  below  the  lower  limit  of  the  specification.  If  NOAA  decided  to  buy
a  new  filter  from  a  different  manufacturer,  it  might  slip  the  delivery  schedule.  The
EXCOM  decided  to  accept  the  recommendation  to  continue  forward  with  VIIRS  de-
velopment  while  continuing  to  seek  a  solution  to  the  crosstalk  issue.  General
Mashiko  indicated  to  the  staff  that  VIIRS  delivery  for  the  NPP  mission  is  still
scheduled for late May next year, and there remains three months of margin in that
schedule.

The  Failure  Review  Board  for  the  CrIS  flight  unit  vibration  test  mishap  believes
an  incorrect  structural  analysis  of  the  instrument  frame  led  to  an  overestimate  of
the  frame’s  strength.  The  subassemblies  are  being  tested  to  see  if  they  suffered
damage;  particularly  the  interferometer,  which  is  the  primary  sensor  element.  The
IPO  has  already  begun  to  build  a  second  interferometer  to  minimize  disruption  if
the  first  is  unusable.  The  frame  for  the  second  flight  unit  will  be  used  in  the  first
instrument  (the  fixes  defined  by  the  failure  analysis  ‘‘will  not  be  pretty’’  but  they
will  work,  according  to  Col.  Stockton).  The  government  technical  team  independ-
ently  analyzed  and  approved  the  frame  changes.  Delivery  of  this  unit  slipped  from
December 2007 to February 2008; three months of margin still remains.

Loss of the CMIS sensor affected two important data items. CMIS was the prime
contributor  to  the  measurement  of  soil  moisture,  critical  to  the  Army  as  it  deter-
mines  whether  heavy  equipment  can  operate  in  a  particular  region.  Requirements
for  collecting  data  on  ocean  winds  were  also  to  be  met  with  CMIS  data,  which  fac-
tors into recent concerns about the possible loss of the QUIKScat scatterometer and
the  resulting  impact  on  hurricane  forecasting.  In  the  Nunn-McCurdy  decision
memorandum,  the  NPOESS  program  was  directed  to  initiate  a  new  microwave  im-
aging sounder that would provide an instrument at least as capable as current tech-
nology in time to fly on the second NPOESS satellite in 2016. General Mashiko stat-
ed that the specifications for this new sensor have been developed, and that the pro-
gram  office  is  consulting  the  user  community.  The  Program  Office  hopes  to  have  a
recommendation  for  Mashiko’s  replacement  as  Executive  Officer  in  September  in
order to obtain EXCOM approval by January 2008.

GAO  notes  in  its  report  that  during  2006  spending  for  NPOESS  space  items  ex-
ceeded the cost target by $17 million (a four percent overrun of the planned budget
for the year). Further, the contractor could not complete $14.6 million planned dur-
ing  the  year.  The  problems  with  the  VIIRS  and  CrIS  instruments  were  the  major
factors.  These  negative  trends  are  likely  to  persist  as  the  testing  programs  on  the
instruments progress. GAO states that these issues may affect the life-cycle cost es-
timate.

There may also be impacts on the cost estimate from the contract modification ne-
gotiations now underway. Schedule milestones will be the primary criteria in award
fee determinations, and the award fees will be small. Northrop Grumman delivered
its  proposals  for  the  contract  modification  May  7.  General  Mashiko  intends  to  have
the new contract signed before she leaves.

GAO concludes that ‘‘restructuring is well under way, and the program has made
progress  in  establishing  an  effective  management  structure.’’  There  has  not  been
enough progress to show that the key technical risks which have bedeviled the pro-
gram  are  being  reduced,  however.  VIIRS  flight  hardware  has  yet  to  be  built,  and
CrIS  flight  hardware  suffered  an  unexpected  failure  in  early  testing.  General
Mashiko  will  not  dispute  that  assessment  but  argues  that  the  steps  taken  by  the
new program management give greater confidence that we have an accurate under-
standing  of  the  risks  and  a  realistic  plan  to  deal  with  them.  GAO  has  already  ac-
cepted a request from the Committee to continue its independent evaluation as exe-
cution of the restructured program advances.

Chairman LAMPSON. This hearing will come to order, and I want
to wish all of you a good afternoon. Welcome to this hearing on the
National  Polar-Orbiting  Operational  Environmental  Satellite  Sys-
tem, NPOESS. These satellites are the next generation of observa-
tional  platforms  that  will  allow  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmos-
pheric  Administration  and  the  Department  of  Defense  to  provide
weather  forecasting  services.  It  is  not  too  much  to  say  that  the
United States cannot get along without them.

And  this  is  not  the  first  hearing  the  Committee  has  held  on
NPOESS,  and  I  am  confident  in  saying  that  it  won’t  be  the  last.
This  has  been  an  area  of  strong  bipartisan  concern  for  several
years.  When  I  left  Congress  in  January  of  ’05  (not  by  choice)  this
committee  was  already  concerned  about  performance  trends  in  the
NPOESS  program.  The  Government  Accountability  Office  had  re-
ported  to  this  subcommittee  in  September,  ’041,  that  a  significant
increase  in  the  cost  estimate  had  occurred,  there  were  technical
problems with the instruments, and there was strong evidence that
there  would  be  a  half-billion-dollar  cost  overrun  at  the  end  of  the
program.

Just over a year later, Mr. Powner has testified in a hearing here
that cost and schedule trends had worsened and said that the pro-
gram  was  in  crisis.2 Soon  after  that  testimony,  Congress  received
notification  that  there  was  good  cause  to  believe  NPOESS  would
exceed  its  acquisition  baseline  cost  by  more  than  25  percent—by
more than the 25 percent needed to trigger a re-certification of the
program  under  the  Nunn-McCurdy  provisions  of  federal  procure-
ment law.3

Today’s  hearing  marks  the  first  time  for  the  Committee  to  get  a
sense  of  how  the  post-Nunn-McCurdy  NPOESS  program  is  faring.
Nunn-McCurdy decisions at the Department of Defense have estab-
lished  a  track  record  of  more  expensive  acquisitions  for  fewer  sat-
ellites.  Perhaps  most  critically,  the  re-certified  program  now  lacks
most  of  the  climate  sensors  that  were  to  fly  on  NPOESS  and  were
to form the heart of our instrumentation to provide data for track-
ing global warming.

The  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy  started  an  effort  to
deal with the climate sensors lost for NPOESS almost immediately
after  the  announcement  of  the  Nunn-McCurdy  decision.  Dr.  John
Marburger is joining us today to explain that process.

My  concern  is  that  the  effort  headed  by  OSTP,  with  analytical
support from NASA and NOAA, is lagging the pace needed to make
effective  decisions.  The  directions  to  the  agencies  are  to  look  at  all
options  for  every  data  need  rather  than  a  direction  to  identify
money  that  could  be  used  to  fund  the  planned  instruments  that
had  been  de-manifested.  You  can  study  that  problem  and  all  pos-
sible  options  for  as  long  as  you  want,  but  at  some  point  the  mani-
fests  for  what  will  fly  on  the  NPOESS  satellites  have  to  be  final-
ized,  and  so  decisions  are  not  just  due.  I  believe  they  are  overdue.

I  think  that  without  decisive  action  and  leadership,  we  will  lose
continuity  in  the  multi-decadal  data  sets  that  are  sensitive—that
are  central  to  our  understanding  of  global  warming.  In  fact,  some
breaches in data collection may be unavoidable at this point. There
was  time,  just  time  to  add  money  into  the  2008  budget  request  if
the  interagency  exercise  had  been  pushed  harder  last  summer.
Now,  one  year  later,  the  problem  is  still  under  study,  and  it  may
be that answers won’t come before the 2009 budget is finalized.

As  to  money,  I  think  that  NASA  and  NOAA  may  not  be  able  to
do  what  needs  to  be  done  without  direct  intervention  from  the
White  House  to  give  them  the  added  resources  necessary  to  fund
those  instruments.  The  President  just  delivered  another  major  ad-
dress  on  climate  change.  Perhaps  one  step  he  could  take  towards
showing other nations that this proposal is a serious one would be
to identify funds to find and to fly the climate sensors.

We will also hear today from David Powner of GAO. Mr. Powner
is a frequent witness before this committee. His testimony today is
less dramatic than at some other times, prior appearances. At this
moment in time the NPOESS program does not appear to be losing
further ground.

According to GAO’s report, the ground systems for NPOESS data
handling  are  now  running  under  their  budget,  and  they  have
achieved  more  than  they  had  planned  to  accomplish  at  this  point.
Such  performances  are  so  rare  it  may  be  that  particular  project
manager deserves the Congressional Gold Medal.

Unfortunately,  that  performance  is  overshadowed  by  the  con-
tinuing risks we see with the major instruments destined to fly on
these  satellites.  Both  the  VIIRS4 and  CrIS5 instruments  still  show
significant  engineering  challenges.  There  is  little  doubt  that  the
challenges  can  be  overcome,  but  the  risk  attaches  to  how  much
time and money the fixes will cost.

There  are  still  a  lot  of  tests  for  NPOESS  to  get  through,  which
means there are many opportunities for unexpected events to upset
the  program.  So  we  have  asked  Mr.  Powner  to  keep  up  the  good
work.

Air  Force  Brigadier  General  Susan  Mashiko  is  also  with  us
today, and in the 20 months that she served as Program Executive
Officer for NPOESS, she has restored a semblance of order in man-
agement  structure,  to  the  management  structure.  Indeed,  the  an-
nouncement  of  her  imminent  rotation  to  another  posting  led  GAO
to  recommend  to  the  Air  Force  that  she  not  be  spared  just  yet.  I
think  that  the  Air  Force  is  going  to  ignore  that  advice,  but  it  may
be to the detriment of the program if solid management is not put
into  place  immediately.  NPOESS  is  not  a  program  that  can  be  al-
lowed to drift along.

We  are  a  year  beyond  the  Nunn-McCurdy  de-manifestation—de-
manifesting  of  both  climate  science  and  space  weather  instru-
ments—and  yet  no  decisions  have  been  made  on  how  to  proceed.
We are a year beyond Nunn-McCurdy with the same instruments

causing us the same concerns about risk.

General  Mashiko  is  a  month  away  from  her  transfer  and  no  re-

placement has been named.

I  think  progress  has  been  made  in  managing  the  downsized
NPOESS program that the Department of Defense brought us, but
not  enough  progress  to  reduce  our  concerns  about  the  future  for
this  satellite  program  or  to  satisfy  our  need  to  see  our  climate
science efforts fully supported.

I  want  to  thank  all  for  you  for  coming,  and  I  will  now  recognize

the Ranking Member, Mr. Inglis, for his opening remarks.
[The prepared statement of Chairman Lampson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN NICK LAMPSON

Good  afternoon,  welcome  to  this  hearing  on  the  National  Polar-Orbiting  Oper-
ational  Environmental  Satellite  System  (NPOESS).  These  satellites  are  the  next
generation  of  observational  platforms  that  will  allow  the  National  Oceanic  and  At-
mospheric  Administration  and  the  Department  of  Defense  to  provide  weather  fore-
casting  services.  It  is  not  too  much  to  say  that  the  United  States  cannot  get  along
without them.

This  is  not  the  first  hearing  the  Committee  has  held  on  NPOESS  and  I  am  con-
fident  in  saying  it  will  not  be  the  last.  This  has  been  an  area  of  strong  bipartisan
concern for several years.

When  I  left  Congress  in  January  of  2005—not  by  choice,  of  course—this  com-
mittee  was  already  concerned  about  performance  trends  in  the  NPOESS  program.
The  Government  Accountability  Office  had  reported  to  this  subcommittee  in  Sep-
tember  2004  that  a  significant  increase  in  the  cost  estimate  had  occurred,  there
were  technical  problems  with  the  instruments  and  there  was  strong  evidence  that
there would be a half-billion-dollar cost overrun at the end of the program.

Just over a year later, Mr. Powner testified in a hearing here that cost and sched-

ule trends had worsened and said the program was in crisis.

Soon  after  that  testimony,  Congress  received  notification  that  there  was  good
cause  to  believe  NPOESS  would  exceed  its  acquisition  baseline  cost  by  more  than
the  25  percent  needed  to  trigger  a  recertification  of  the  program  under  the  Nunn-
McCurdy provisions in federal procurement law.

Today’s hearing marks the first time for the Committee to get a sense of how the
post-Nunn-McCurdy  NPOESS  program  is  faring.  Nunn-McCurdy  decisions  at  the
Department  of  Defense  have  established  a  track  record  of  more  expensive  acquisi-
tions for fewer satellites.

Perhaps most critically, the recertified program now lacks most of the climate sen-
sors that were to fly on NPOESS and were to form the heart of our instrumentation
to provide data for tracking global warming.

The Office of Science and Technology Policy started an effort to deal with the cli-
mate  sensors  lost  for  NPOESS  almost  immediately  after  the  announcement  of  the
Nunn-McCurdy  decision.  Dr.  John  Marburger  is  joining  us  today  to  explain  that
process.

My  concern  is  that  the  effort  headed  by  OSTP,  with  analytical  support  from

NASA and NOAA, is lagging the pace needed to make effective decisions.

The directions to the agencies are to look at all options for every data need rather
than  a  direction  to  identify  money  that  could  be  used  to  fund  the  planned  instru-
ments that had been de-manifested.

You can study that problem and all possible options for as long as you want, but
at  some  point,  the  manifests  for  what  will  fly  on  the  NPOESS  satellites  have  to  be
finalized, and so decisions are not just due, I believe they are overdue.

I think that without decisive action and leadership, we will lose continuity in the
multi-decadal data sets that are central to our understanding of global warming. In
fact, some breaches in data collection may be unavoidable at this point.

There was just time to add money into the 2008 budget request if the interagency
exercise  had  been  pushed  harder  last  summer.  Now,  one  year  later,  the  problem  is
still under study and it may be that answers won’t come in before the 2009 budget
is finalized.

As  to  money,  I  think  that  NASA  and  NOAA  may  not  be  able  to  do  what  needs
to be done without direct intervention from the White House to give them the added
resources necessary to fund those instruments.

The  President  just  delivered  another  major  address  on  climate  change.  Perhaps
one step he could take towards showing other nations that this proposal is a serious
one would be to identify funds to fly the climate sensors.

We  will  also  hear  today  from  David  Powner  of  GAO.  Mr.  Powner  is  a  frequent
witness  before  the  Committee.  His  testimony  today  is  less  dramatic  than  at  some
prior  appearances.  At  this  moment  in  time,  the  NPOESS  program  does  not  appear
to be losing further ground.

According  to  GAO’s  report,  the  ground  systems  for  NPOESS  data  handling  are
now  running  under  their  budget  and  they  have  achieved  more  than  they  had
planned to accomplish at this point.

Such performances are so rare it may be that particular project manager deserves

the Congressional Gold Medal.

Unfortunately,  that  performance  is  overshadowed  by  the  continuing  risks  we  see

with the major instruments destined to fly on these satellites.

Both  the  VIIRS  and  CrIS  instruments  still  show  significant  engineering  chal-
lenges.  There  is  little  doubt  that  the  challenges  can  be  overcome,  but  the  risk  at-
taches to how much time and money the fixes will cost.

There  are  still  a  lot  of  tests  for  NPOESS  to  get  through,  which  means  there  are
many  opportunities  for  unexpected  events  to  upset  the  program.  So  we  have  asked
Mr. Powner to keep up the good work.

Air  Force  Brigadier  General  Susan  Mashiko  is  also  with  us  today.  In  the  20
months she has served as Program Executive Officer for NPOESS, she has restored
a  semblance  of  order  to  the  management  structure.  Indeed,  the  announcement  of
her  imminent  rotation  to  another  posting  led  GAO  to  recommend  to  the  Air  Force
that she could not be spared just yet.

I think the Air Force is going to ignore that advice, but it may be to the detriment
of  the  program  if  solid  management  is  not  put  in  place  immediately.  NPOESS  is
not a program that can be allowed to drift along.

We  are  a  year  beyond  the  Nunn-McCurdy  de-manifesting  of  both  climate  science
and space weather instruments and yet no decisions have been made on how to pro-
ceed.

We are a year beyond Nunn-McCurdy with the same instruments causing us some

of the same concerns about risk.

General Mashiko is a month away from her transfer and no replacement has been

named.

I  think  progress  has  been  made  in  managing  the  downsized  NPOESS  program
that  the  Department  of  Defense  brought  us,  but  not  enough  progress  to  reduce  our
concerns about the future for this satellite program or to satisfy our need to see our
climate science efforts fully supported.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Good  afternoon,  and  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  for
holding this hearing about the National Polar-Orbiting Operational
Environmental  Satellite  System,  NPOESS.  This  hearing  continues
close  oversight  of  this  vital  weather  satellite  program,  oversight
that started under the Republican leadership of this committee.

Under  the  Republican  leadership  in  the  last  Congress,  this  com-
mittee  held  three  high-profile  hearings  about  NPOESS.  In  looking
over  the  testimony  for  today’s  hearing,  it  appears  to  me  that  close
oversight  has  paid  off.  For  the  most  part,  the  program  is  on  track
under the new plan announced in June of 2006.

Of  course,  risks  remain  for  a  satellite  known  as  ‘‘the  most  com-
plex  environmental  satellite  system  ever  developed,’’  but  the  gov-
ernment  has  plans  in  place  to  address  most  of  the  risks  identified
by GAO. Also, the government is actively examining the options to
provide  environmental  data  that  we  had  expected  from  NPOESS
but under the new plan we will not receive.

But  simply  because  things  appear  under  control  right  now,  I
don’t  want  to  imply  that  Congress,  or  the  Administration  for  that
matter,  can  back  off  from  our  close  oversight  of  NPOESS.  In  fact,
I believe just the opposite. Lack of oversight of the management of
NPOESS,  the  contractor,  and  the  many  technical  problems  facing
NPOESS  all  led  to  the  June  2006,  Nunn-McCurdy  certification  in
the first place.

Those  of  us  responsible  for  this  program—Congress,  NOAA,  the
Air Force, and NASA—cannot sit back and relax or we will risk yet

another  four-year  delay  or  doubling  of  costs.  NPOESS  today  is  a
$12.5  billion  program.  That  is  a  lot  of  taxpayer  money.  We  expect
that  investment  to  provide  a  series  of  weather  satellites  that  are
launched on time and provide data to inform everything from deci-
sions about our military troop operations to forecasting the path of
hurricanes.

Also,  I  expect  that  the  interagency  report  on  avoiding  gaps  in
other  environmental  data  be  completed  as  soon  as  reasonably  pos-
sible.  The  longer  we  wait  to  make  a  final  decision  on  this,  the
greater  risk  we  face  of  having  a  gap  in  data  important  for  under-
standing global climate change and for seasonal forecasts of events
like El Nin˜ o.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  our  witnesses  today  and  yield

back the balance of my time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BOB INGLIS

Good  afternoon.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Lampson,  for  holding  this  hearing  about
the  National  Polar-orbiting  Operational  Environmental  Satellite  System,  NPOESS.
This hearing continues close oversight of this vital weather satellite program, over-
sight that started under Republican leadership of this committee.

Under Republican leadership in the last Congress, this committee held three high-
profile  hearings  about  NPOESS.  In  looking  over  the  testimony  for  today’s  hearing,
it  appears  to  me  that  close  oversight  has  paid  off.  For  the  most  part,  the  program
is on track under the new plan announced in June 2006.

Of course, risks remain for a satellite known as ‘‘the most complex environmental
satellite system ever developed.’’ But, the government has plans in place to address
most of the risks identified by GAO. Also, the government is actively examining op-
tions to provide environmental data that we had expected from NPOESS but under
the new plan we will not receive.

But, simply because things appear under control right now, I do not want to imply

NPOESS all led to the June 2006 Nunn-McCurdy certification in the first place.

Those  of  us  responsible  for  this  program,  Congress,  NOAA,  the  Air  Force,  and
NASA, cannot sit back and relax or we risk yet another four-year delay or doubling
of costs. NPOESS today is a $12.5 billion program. That is a lot of taxpayer money.
We  expect  that  investment  to  provide  a  series  of  weather  satellites  that  are

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Inglis.  I  ask  unanimous

Committee  Members  be  included  in  the  record.  Without  objection

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MARK UDALL

Mr.  Chairman,  I’m  very  concerned  about  the  status  of  the  entire  NPOESS  pro-
gram,  not  only  because  of  the  critically  important  climate  data  that  may  be  lost  if
a  home  is  not  found  for  the  de-manifested  instruments,  but  also  because  the  de-
manifesting of those instruments is having a great impact on my district.

On  the  plus  side,  I  am  pleased  that  NASA  and  NOAA  have  worked  together  to
find  the  funding  needed  to  bring  back  the  OMPS  Limb  sensor  for  the  NPP  space-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:15 Jul 23, 2008 Jkt 035707 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\060707\35707 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

craft.  OMPS  Limb,  which  is  being  built  by  Ball  Aerospace  in  Boulder,  will  provide
measurements of ozone in our atmosphere.

However,  it  is  clear  that  other  instruments  are  not  faring  as  well.  I  am  particu-
larly concerned about the Total Solar Irradiance Sensor (TSIS) and the Space Envi-
ronment Sensor Suite (SESS).

TSIS  will  provide  essential  data  on  the  impact  that  the  sun  has  on  our  atmos-
phere and climate—and it is the number one priority instrument listed in the recent
National  Research  Council’s  Decadal  Survey  on  Earth  Science.  It  was  being  devel-
oped by the University of Colorado’s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics.
However,  with  the  funding  pulled  for  this  instrument  for  NPOESS,  the  research-
ers and engineers working on this instrument may have to leave LASP to find other
careers, jeopardizing our ability to have this instrument available to fly when need-
ed.

We  need  one  agency  to  take  responsibility  for  this  critical  instrument  and  its
funding. NASA and NOAA would be the logical agencies and I hope that a decision
is made about a lead agency soon. TSIS has been abandoned for too long and, unless
additional  funding  is  found  by  the  middle  of  July,  we  are  going  to  lose  critical
human capital.

I  am  also  very  concerned  about  the  status  of  the  SESS.  The  information  that  it
provides  is  essential  for  us  to  better  understand  and  predict  solar  flares  and  their
impact on our economy. These flares have wide reaching impacts on everything from
airplane  flights  over  the  poles  to  telecommunications  across  the  world.  The  Space
Environment Center in my district has been key to enabling governments and busi-
nesses prepare for increased solar activity. Yet without SESS, we will not only curb
our advances, but we may also lose the capabilities that we currently have.

I  will  continue  to  closely  monitor  the  status  of  TSIS  and  SESS,  along  with  the

rest of NPOESS.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  We  are  very  pleased  to  have  this  distin-
guished  panel  of  witnesses  here  this  afternoon.  Dr.  John
Marburger,  a  science  advisor  to  the  President  and  Director  of  the
Office of Science and Technology Policy, OSTP, in the Executive Of-
fice of the President. Prior to his appointment as Director of OSTP,
Dr. Marburger served as Director of the Brookhaven National Lab-
oratory  in  New  York  and  as  President  of  the  State  University  of
New York at Stony Brook. Dr. Marburger has appeared before our
committee  many  times.  Today  he  is  here  to  discuss  OSTP’s  efforts
to provide continuity in our climate observing system, and I thank
you for being here. Good afternoon.

Mr.  David  Powner  is  the  Director  of  IT  Management  Issues  for
the  U.S.  Government  Accountability  Office,  GAO.  Mr.  Powner  and
his  team  have  been  diligently  tracking  satellite  procurement  pro-
grams  for  this  committee  since  2001.  He  is  here  today  to  discuss
their  latest  report  on  the  current  status  of  the  NPOESS  program.
Your  team’s  work  has  been  extremely  valuable  to  the  Members  of
the Committee. We thank you for your excellent work and for being
here to testify this afternoon.

And  finally  we  have  Brigadier  General  Susan  Mashiko.  General
Mashiko  is  the  Program  Executive  Officer  for  Environmental  Sat-
ellites.  She  oversees  the  Integrated  Program  Office,  the  tri-agency
organization  that  is  in  charge  of  the  development  of  the  new  polar
satellite  system,  NPOESS.  General  Mashiko  has  held  a  variety  of
positions  in  the  Department  of  Defense,  including  Program  Man-
ager  for  the  Atlas  V  Program,  Chief  of  the  Programs  Division  in
the  Office  of  Special  Projects,  and  Executive  Officer  to  the  DOD
Space  Architect.  She  has  been  overseeing  the  NPOESS  program
since  November  of  2005,  and  we  are  pleased  to  have  you  here  this
afternoon as well, General.

You will each have five minutes for your spoken testimony. Your
written  testimony  may  be  included  in  the  record  for  the  hearing.

STATEMENT OF DR. JOHN H. MARBURGER, III, DIRECTOR, OF-
FICE  OF  SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY  POLICY,  EXECUTIVE
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT
Dr. MARBURGER. Thank you very much, Chairman Lampson, and
Ranking  Member  Inglis,  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  I  am
pleased to appear today to describe the activities of OSTP and Ex-
ecutive Branch agencies related to the NPOESS program. My writ-
ten  testimony  discusses  the  ongoing  interagency  assessment  of  the
impacts  of  de-manifesting  several  Earth-observing  and  space  envi-
ronment  sensors  from  the  NPOESS  spacecraft  during  the  2006  re-
structuring  of  the  program.  My  written  testimony  also  discusses
some  other  related  systems,  and  I  appreciate  it  being  included  in
the record.

The  background  material  in  your  charter  for  today’s  hearing  de-
scribes  the  history  of  the  NPOESS  program,  and  I  will  not  repeat
it  here.  From  the  point  of  view  of  science  impacts,  it  is  important
to  understand  that  in  the  restructuring  process  the  agencies  gave
highest priority to preserving continuity and operational terrestrial
weather forecasting capabilities, which was the original focus of the
program.  And  as  you  know  the  restructuring  decision  which  was
announced  on  June  5,  2006,  reduced  the  number  of  operating
NPOESS  satellites  and  orbits  and  also  removed  several  Earth-ob-
serving  and  space  weather-related  sensors  from  the  baseline  pro-
gram budget.

When my office learned of these decisions, we convened an inter-
agency  meeting  later  that  June,  including  representatives  from
NASA,  NOAA,  and  the  NPOESS  Integrated  Program  Office.  We
wanted  first  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  the  projected  capa-
bilities  of  the  revised  program;  second,  to  explore  the  implications
of  these  changes  for  climate  and  ocean  research  activities;  and
third, to obtain agency views and information on ways to retain the
capabilities of sensors removed from the baseline. Based on discus-
sions in this meeting we asked NASA and NOAA to provide my of-
fice,  OSTP,  with  a  joint  technical  assessment  of  the  expected
science implications of the NPOESS restructuring decision and op-
tions  for  addressing  those  impacts  in  terms  of  climate  research.
NASA/NOAA  responded  with  a  white  paper  in  January  of  this
year.6

This initial response included a good analysis of the potential cli-
mate  science  impacts  of  the  restructuring  decision.  It  also  ad-
dressed  the  projected  impacts  of  eliminating  each  sensor  and
prioritized the de-manifested sensors in terms of the importance of
their measurements.

The  options  it  presented  for  retaining  the  capabilities  of  the
eliminated  sensors  focused  mostly  on  re-manifesting  them  back
onto NPOESS.

Because  that  white  paper  did  not  include  the  full  range  of  op-
tions  for  retaining  climate  and  ocean  research  capabilities  and  did
not make cost estimates that are essential for policy-making, OSTP
asked the agencies for more information on these issues, and NASA
and NOAA are in the process of developing that information.

Interagency  discussions  and  follow-up  questions  and  analyses
will continue throughout the summer and fall and feed into the fis-
cal  year  2009  budget  process.  One  important  decision  has  already
been  made.  The  sensor  known  as  OMPS–Limb7 has  been  restored
to  fly  on  NASA’s  NPOESS  Preparatory  Project  satellite,  the  NPP,
which  is  scheduled  to  launch  in  2009.  NASA  and  NOAA  will  split
the cost to re-manifest the OMPS–Limb instrument.

I want to thank this committee for its interest in this project and
its  support  of  the  program  and  related  sensor  studies.  We  face
more  challenges  in  addressing  these  topics,  but  we  are  making
progress. We are working closely with interested agencies in devis-
ing the way forward.

And I would be pleased to respond to questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN H. MARBURGER, III

Chairman Lampson, Ranking Member Inglis, and Members of the Subcommittee,
I am pleased to appear before you today to describe OSTP and interagency activities
related  to  the  National  Polar-orbiting  Operational  Environmental  Satellite  System
(NPOESS)  weather  satellite  program.  As  you  requested,  I  will  discuss  the  ongoing
interagency  assessment  of  the  impacts  of  removing  or  ‘‘de-manifesting’’  several
Earth-observing  and  space  environment  sensors  from  the  NPOESS  spacecraft  dur-
ing  the  2006  restructuring  of  the  program.  I  will  also  describe  certain  other  impor-
tant climate-related activities of potential interest to the Committee.

First  let  me  briefly  outline  the  NPOESS  program  and  its  history.  The  NPOESS
effort was established through Presidential Decision Directive in 1994, with the goal
of  integrating  the  polar  weather  capabilities  developed  by  the  Department  of  De-
fense (DOD) and the Department of Commerce (DOC) into one next-generation pro-
gram  that  would  support  both  civil  and  military  weather  requirements.  The  role  of
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was to improve the re-
mote  sensing  capabilities  of  the  operational  system  through  the  insertion  of  new
technologies. The idea was to have one next-generation program that would support
both  civil  and  military  weather  requirements  and  to  align  overlapping  and  com-
plementary capabilities to increase efficiency and data synergy. As planning evolved,
a  number  of  other  Earth-observing  and  space  environment  sensors  and  capabilities
were  incorporated  into  the  basic  program,  making  NPOESS  (as  envisioned  at  that
time) a key component not only for operational weather forecasting, but also for re-
search on climate, oceans, and space weather.

Oversight  of  the  NPOESS  program  is  provided  jointly  by  the  three  agencies
through an Executive Committee, and funding is divided equally between DOD and
DOC.  Within  this  tri-agency  framework,  DOD  is  responsible  for  major  program  ac-
quisitions  (conducted  through  the  Air  Force),  DOC’s  National  Oceanic  and  Atmos-
pheric  Administration  (NOAA)  is  responsible  for  satellite  operations,  and  NASA  is
responsible for developing new technologies. Development and other activities with-
in  the  program  are  managed  by  an  integrated  program  office.  These  arrangements
for  NPOESS  are  unique  within  the  Federal  Government,  and  many  consider  it  the
most complex environmental satellite system ever developed.

Previous  communications  to  Congress  during  hearings  and  in  Executive  Branch
correspondence have reported numerous technical, developmental, and management
challenges in the NPOESS program since its inception, resulting in various cost in-
creases and scheduling delays. In late 2005, the NPOESS integrated program office

determined  that  projected  cost  over-runs  for  NPOESS  would  exceed  the  25  percent
threshold triggering a breach of the Nunn-McCurdy statute, thus requiring the Sec-
retary of Defense to certify that the program meets the following criteria: it is essen-
tial to the national security, no alternatives provide equal or greater military capa-
bility at less cost, new estimates of the program acquisition unit cost are reasonable,
and  the  management  structure  is  adequate  to  manage  and  control  program  costs.
Accordingly,  DOD  worked  with  DOC  and  NASA  through  the  first  half  of  2006  to
restructure the NPOESS effort in order to address the significant cost over-run and
reduce program risk. In this certification process, the agencies gave highest priority
to preserving continuity in operational terrestrial weather forecasting capabilities—
the original focus of the program. The ultimate decision regarding the restructuring
of NPOESS was announced on June 5, 2006.

The current restructured NPOESS program includes four NPOESS satellites oper-
ating in two orbits, augmented by data from a European weather system using sev-
eral  sensors  provided  by  the  United  States  in  a  third  orbit.  (In  contrast,  the  pro-
gram before restructuring had planned on flying six NPOESS satellites in three or-
bits.)  To  decrease  costs  and  help  maintain  continuity  in  operational  weather  capa-
bilities, the three agencies also decided to remove several Earth-observing and space
weather-related sensors from the baseline NPOESS program budget—effectively re-
moving  these  sensors  from  NPOESS—and  to  de-scope  certain  other  instruments  in
terms  of  performance.  It  is  important  to  note  that  NPOESS,  as  restructured,  still
satisfies  many  climate  data  requirements.  In  addition,  the  recertified  program  re-
tains  funding  within  the  NPOESS  baseline  for  the  reintegration  of  the  de-mani-
fested  sensors  should  a  way  be  found  to  provide  them  from  outside  the  program.
Nevertheless, the potential impacts to the climate science program continue to raise
concerns.

When  my  office  (OSTP)  learned  of  these  decisions,  we  convened  an  interagency
meeting  in  late  June  2006,  including  representatives  from  NASA,  NOAA  and  the
NPOESS  integrated  program  office,  to  (1)  gain  a  better  understanding  of  the  pro-
jected  capabilities  of  the  revised  program,  (2)  explore  the  implications  of  these
changes  for  climate  and  ocean  research  activities,  and  (3)  obtain  agency  views  on
ways  to  retain  the  capabilities  of  sensors  removed  from  the  baseline  NPOESS  con-
figuration.  Based  on  the  discussions  in  this  meeting  and  our  sense  that  more  work
was  needed  on  these  topics,  we  asked  NASA  and  NOAA  to  provide  OSTP  with  a
joint  technical  assessment  of  the  expected  science  implications  of  the  NPOESS  re-
structuring  decision,  and  options  for  addressing  those  impacts  in  terms  of  climate
research  (implications  for  space  weather  research  and  activities  will  be  addressed
separately).  In  response  to  our  request,  a  joint  NASA/NOAA  assessment  was  pro-
vided to OSTP in early January 2007, in the form of a ‘‘white paper.’’

The  initial  NASA/NOAA  response  to  OSTP  includes  an  analysis  of  the  potential
climate science impacts of the 2006 NPOESS restructuring decision. It also address-
es  the  projected  impacts  of  eliminating  each  sensor  and  provides  prioritized
rankings of the de-manifested sensors in terms of the importance of their measure-
ments.  In  addition,  the  white  paper  presents  options  for  retaining  the  capabilities
of  the  eliminated  sensors  that  focus  largely  on  re-manifesting  them  back  onto
NPOESS.

The  NASA/NOAA  white  paper  is  useful  for  understanding  the  dimensions  of  the
problems  created  by  restructuring,  and  is  a  helpful  and  important  contribution  to
the  process  of  resolving  them.  At  the  same  time,  it  does  not  include  the  full  range
of options for retaining the climate and ocean research capabilities, and does not in-
clude cost estimates that are essential for policy-making. Consequently, OSTP asked
the  agencies  for  further  analysis  of  a  broader  range  of  options,  including  potential
solutions  such  as  free-flyers,  adding  instruments  to  other  U.S.  Government  space-
craft,  or  international  cooperative  opportunities.  We  also  requested  that  NASA  and
NOAA provide cost estimates for the full range of options being explored. NASA and
NOAA are in the process of developing information for OSTP and the Office of Man-
agement  and  Budget  regarding  various  options  and  preliminary  cost  estimates  for
those options.

Interagency discussions and follow-up questions and analyses regarding these and
other  potential  mitigation  strategies  will  continue  throughout  the  summer  and  fall.
Our  goal  is  to  complete  this  phase  of  the  analysis  in  time  to  inform  the  FY  2009
budget  process,  where  this  information  could  be  considered  along  with  other  ele-
ments  of  department  and  agency  requests.  One  decision  has  already  been  made—
the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) Limb has been restored to fly on the
NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) satellite, which is scheduled to launch in 2009.
NASA and NOAA will split the cost to re-manifest the OMPS–Limb instrument.

Regarding instruments other than OMPS–Limb, there have been no decisions yet
on  options,  program  schedules,  or  identification  of  funds.  Those  issues  will  need  to

be addressed as the process unfolds in coming months. My priorities during this re-
view  are  to  promote  continuity  of  key  climate  data  needs  while  ensuring  that  cur-
rent  planned  missions  are  not  negatively  impacted  by  payload  modifications.  While
much remains to be completed, I must emphasize that NASA, NOAA and members
of  my  staff  are  investing  much  time  and  effort  on  this  difficult  problem.  Other  por-
tions  of  the  scientific  community  are  providing  useful  input  as  well.  For  example,
we are looking forward to the results of an NRC workshop later this month regard-
ing these and related Earth-observation issues. The necessary work is getting done,
and OSTP will continue to monitor the process closely as it moves forward.

In addition to the NPOESS climate-related sensors that are the focus of the ongo-
ing  assessment,  a  suite  of  space  weather  sensors  was  also  de-manifested  from  the
baseline NPOESS effort during the 2006 restructuring of the program, as noted ear-
lier.  These  sensors  were  an  important  element  of  the  Nation’s  planned  capabilities
for  observing  and  predicting  space  weather  phenomena  such  as  solar  flares,  sun-
spots, auroras and the solar wind. The loss of such measurements could have a seri-
ous  impact  on  a  wide  range  of  U.S.  operations  and  research.  Accordingly,  and  as
with the de-manifested climate sensors, we have requested that agencies with space
weather  interests,  including  DOD,  DOC,  and  NASA,  provide  a  joint  assessment  of
the  impacts  of  the  NPOESS  restructuring  decision  on  national  space  weather-re-
lated  capabilities  and  goals,  followed  by  an  assessment  of  potential  options  for  ad-
dressing  such  impacts.  This  effort  is  in  its  early  stages  and  likely  will  require  sev-
eral  months  to  complete.  Our  goal  in  this  effort  is  to  obtain  the  necessary  informa-
tion  in  time  to  inform  the  FY  2010  budget  process—a  suitable  schedule  for  this
analysis according to the agencies involved.

I  would  like  to  mention  some  other  climate-related  issues  today  that  are  not  di-
rectly  linked  to  NPOESS  but  are  part  of  the  broader  context  for  OSTP’s  ongoing
work on Earth observations. The fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shows that great progress has been made in char-
acterizing and understanding Earth’s climate system and how that system is chang-
ing, and U.S. Government-funded Earth observations have been critical in achieving
this progress. Earth observations are important for characterizing the impacts of cli-
mate  change  to  natural  and  human  systems,  and  for  many  other  applications  such
as  improved  weather  forecasts,  predicting  and  responding  to  natural  disasters,
water  resource  management,  characterizing  air  quality  and  assessing  ecosystem
health.  While  current  challenges  to  maintaining  and  improving  U.S.  Earth-observ-
ing  systems  exist,  as  noted  in  the  recently  released  National  Research  Council
(NRC) Decadal Survey on Earth Science, I want to emphasize that this Administra-
tion is committed to supporting these capabilities.

The  NRC  report  points  out  that  no  single  mechanism  currently  exists  for  coordi-
nating  all  national  Earth-observing  needs  across  agencies.  Although  the  Climate
Change  Science  Program  has  an  Observations  Working  Group  to  facilitate  inter-
agency  understanding  and  information  exchanges,  it  has  not  yet  developed  a  na-
tional strategy for climate observations—nor has any other group. Climate observa-
tion plans have been part of individual agency program plans and budgets, or have
been  assembled  through  mission-specific  collaborative  processes  like  the  one  that
produced  NPOESS.  This  situation  exists  for  most  other  observation  types  as  well,
not  just  those  for  climate.  For  example,  there  is  an  Interagency  Working  Group  on
Ocean Observations that is looking at a range of ocean-related observations, includ-
ing but not limited to, those focusing on climate. Similarly, there is a NASA–NOAA
Joint Working Group on Research-Operations Transition intended to address issues
associated  with  the  transition  of  observations  initiated  as  research  into  operational
ones.

Several  organizations  including  the  NRC  have  noted  the  need  for  a  plan  to
achieve and sustain global Earth observations, and this issue has been taken up by
the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council  Subcommittee  on  Earth  Observations
(known  as  the  U.S.  Group  on  Earth  Observations,  or  USGEO).  USGEO,  which  is
co-chaired by OSTP, NASA, and NOAA, recently reorganized to focus on a national
strategy  for  Earth  observations  that  would  address  topics  such  as  organizational
roles  and  responsibilities,  data  collection  and  sharing  protocols,  and  sector-specific
priorities  for  investment.  This  process  is  ongoing,  and  I  anticipate  that  at  least  a
year will be required to produce a strategic plan for this complex issue.

OSTP  is  also  engaged  in  an  emerging  national  coordination  requirement  for  me-
dium-resolution  land  imaging  data.  I  have  directed  an  interagency  working  group
to  address  the  long-term  continuity  of  Landsat-type  data  through  an  effort  known
as  the  Future  of  Land  Imaging  (FLI)  Plan.  As  you  know,  the  Landsat  Data  Con-
tinuity  Mission  (LDCM)  is  currently  in  procurement  in  NASA  and  is  scheduled  for
launch in 2011. The Landsat interagency working group is developing the FLI plan
for  extending  these  important  systems  beyond  LDCM  and  into  the  future.  The

group’s  report  is  currently  in  clearance  and  will  be  published  within  the  next  two
months.

Thank  you  for  your  interest  in  and  support  for  these  issues,  including  not  only
the  NPOESS-related  sensor  studies  but  also  the  other  Earth-observing  topics  that
I have mentioned. There certainly are further challenges ahead in addressing these
topics, but we are making progress and are working closely with interested agencies
in devising the way forward. I would be pleased to respond to questions.

BIOGRAPHY FOR JOHN H. MARBURGER, III

John  H.  Marburger,  III,  Science  Adviser  to  the  President  and  Director  of  the  Of-
fice  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy,  was  born  on  Staten  Island,  N.Y.,  grew  up  in
Maryland  near  Washington  D.C.  and  attended  Princeton  University  (B.A.,  Physics
1962)  and  Stanford  University  (Ph.D.,  Applied  Physics  1967).  Before  his  appoint-
ment  in  the  Executive  Office  of  the  President,  he  served  as  Director  of  Brookhaven
National  Laboratory  from  1998,  and  as  the  third  President  of  the  State  University
of New York at Stony Brook (1980–1994). He came to Long Island in 1980 from the
University  of  Southern  California  where  he  had  been  a  Professor  of  Physics  and
Electrical  Engineering,  serving  as  Physics  Department  Chairman  and  Dean  of  the
College  of  Letters,  Arts  and  Sciences  in  the  1970’s.  In  the  fall  of  1994  he  returned
to  the  faculty  at  Stony  Brook,  teaching  and  doing  research  in  optical  science  as  a
University Professor. Three years later he became President of Brookhaven Science
Associates,  a  partnership  between  the  university  and  Battelle  Memorial  Institute
that competed for and won the contract to operate Brookhaven National Laboratory.
While at the University of Southern California, Marburger contributed to the rap-
idly growing field of nonlinear optics, a subject created by the invention of the laser
in  1960.  He  developed  theory  for  various  laser  phenomena  and  was  a  co-founder  of
the  University  of  Southern  California’s  Center  for  Laser  Studies.  His  teaching  ac-
tivities included ‘‘Frontiers of Electronics,’’ a series of educational programs on CBS
television.

Marburger’s presidency at Stony Brook coincided with the opening and growth of
University  Hospital  and  the  development  of  the  biological  sciences  as  a  major
strength  of  the  university.  During  the  1980’s  federally  sponsored  scientific  research
at  Stony  Brook  grew  to  exceed  that  of  any  other  public  university  in  the  north-
eastern United States.

During his presidency, Marburger served on numerous boards and committees, in-
cluding  chairmanship  of  the  Governor’s  Commission  on  the  Shoreham  Nuclear
Power  facility,  and  chairmanship  of  the  80  campus  ‘‘Universities  Research  Associa-
tion’’  which  operates  Fermi  National  Accelerator  Laboratory  near  Chicago.  He
served  as  a  trustee  of  Princeton  University  and  many  other  organizations.  He  also
chaired the highly successful 1991/92 Long Island United Way campaign.

As a public spirited scientist-administrator, Marburger has served local, State and
Federal governments in a variety of capacities. He is credited with bringing an open,
reasoned approach to contentious issues where science intersects with the needs and
concerns  of  society.  His  strong  leadership  of  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory  fol-
lowing a series of environmental and management crises is widely acknowledged to
have  won  back  the  confidence  and  support  of  the  community  while  preserving  the
Laboratory’s record of outstanding science.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Dr. Marburger.
Mr. Powner.

STATEMENT OF MR. DAVID A. POWNER, DIRECTOR, INFORMA-
TION  TECHNOLOGY  MANAGEMENT  ISSUES,  U.S.  GOVERN-
MENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE
Mr.  POWNER.  Chairman  Lampson,  Ranking  Member  Inglis,  and
Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  we  appreciate  the  opportunity  to
testify  on  NPOESS,  a  planned  satellite  system  whose  life  cycle
costs will now exceed $12 billion.

NPOESS  is  critical  to  our  nation’s  ability  to  monitor  changes  in
weather  and  the  environment.  Over  the  past  several  years
NPOESS  has  experienced  significant  cost  overruns  and  delays  due
to  sensor  development  problems,  poor  contractor  performance  and

program  management,  and  inadequate  executive  level  involvement
that led to a June, 2006, decision to restructure the program.

This  decision  decreased  the  complexity  of  the  program  by  reduc-
ing  the  number  of  sensors,  increased  the  estimated  cost  by  $4  bil-
lion,  and  delayed  the  launches  of  satellites  by  three  to  five  years.
Since  then  the  NPOESS  program  has  made  progress  and  is  cur-
rently  being  managed  with  much  more  rigor  than  we  have  pre-
viously  seen  as  part  of  our  numerous  reviews  for  this  committee.
However,  we  remain  concerned  about  its  remaining  risks;  the
interagency management of this tri-agency program, the premature
rotation  of  the  program’s  key  executive,  continued  staffing  short-
ages,  and  whether  this  program  can  be  executed  within  the  $12.5
billion life cycle cost estimate.

Before  expanding  on  each  of  these  concerns,  General  Mashiko
and her team deserve credit for increasing program oversight, insti-
tuting  more  frequent  and  rigorous  program  reviews,  and  holding
NPOESS’s  contractors  more  accountable.  In  addition,  this  commit-
tee’s oversight role has been instrumental in driving these manage-
ment improvements. Despite these efforts, the NPOESS program is
still  fraught  with  risks.  Recent  program  assessments  to  NPOESS’s
Executive Committee rate the cost, schedule, technical and funding
status  each  as  yellow.  Our  report  being  released  today8 highlights
the  major  technical  risks  associated  with  two  critical  sensors
known  as  VIIRS  and  CrIS.  Specifically,  VIIRS  has  experienced
problems  during  testing  with  image  quality  and  reliability,  and
CrIS failed during vibration testing. Both sensors remain high risk.
We  also  remain  concerned  about  the  interagency  coordination
and commitment required to effectively manage this tri-agency pro-
gram. Following last summer’s restructuring, the Secretaries of De-
fense and Commerce and the Administrator of NASA were required
to sign a revised memorandum of agreement by August, 2006, and
revise  and  approve  key  acquisition  documents  a  month  later.  To
date this has not occurred, and this executive level foot-dragging is
unacceptable.

This  is  more  than  a  paper  exercise  since  finalizing  these  docu-
ments is critical to insuring interagency agreements and will allow
the  programs  to  move  forward  in  completing  a  new  baseline  and
contract by next month.

We  also  remain  concerned  about  having  the  right  people  on
board to effectively oversee and manage this program. DOD’s plans
for  reassigning  the  Program  Executive  Officer  (PEO)  next  month
increases  the  program’s  risk.  Establishing  the  PEO  structure  and
having  a  seasoned  executive  in  this  role  has  streamlined  executive
decision-making and has resulted in more aggressive risk manage-
ment throughout the program. The PEO has only been in this posi-
tion for 19 months. Given that the program is currently still being
restructured  and  that  significant  challenges  remain,  this  move
adds unnecessary risks to an already risky program.

In addition, the NPOESS program still lacks key staff needed to
effectively  manage  this  program.  These  staff  include  systems  engi-
neers and budget and cost analysts. As a result the program lacks

the  staff  it  needs  to  oversee  the  technical  aspects  of  the  program
and assess contractor costs and progress reports.

Finally,  we  remain  skeptical  of  the  program’s  ability  to  execute
within  the  $12.5  billion.  Specifically,  the  costs  will  likely  increase
due to the technical problems associated with key sensors. In addi-
tion,  the  contractors’  preliminary  estimate  of  the  restructured  pro-
gram  is  higher  than  current  estimates.  The  extent  of  these  in-
creases  should  be  known  next  month  when  contractor  negotiations
are expected to conclude.

In  summary,  Mr.  Chairman,  despite  some  progress,  NPOESS  is
far from being out of the woods. Moving forward, it is essential that
the  program  aggressively  manage  its  remaining  developmental
risks—especially  those  associated  with  high-risk  sensors—approve
key  documents  to  assure  tri-agency  agreement  and  commitment  is
in place, staff key positions to ensure the right folks are on-board—
especially in the engineering and cost areas—and strongly consider
reevaluating the reassignment of the PEO until next summer when
key  sensors  are  to  be  delivered  for  NPOESS’s  demonstration  sat-
ellite.  Failing  to  address  any  of  these  concerns  will  lead  to  addi-
tional cost increases and scheduled delays.

This concludes my statement. Thank you for your leadership and

oversight of this critical acquisition.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Powner follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID A. POWNER

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:

We  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  today’s  hearing  to  discuss  our
work  on  the  $12.5  billion  dollar  National  Polar-orbiting  Operational  Environmental
Satellite  System  (NPOESS)  program.  NPOESS  is  expected  to  be  a  state-of-the-art,
environment-monitoring satellite system that will replace two existing polar-orbiting
environmental  satellite  systems.  Polar-orbiting  satellites  provide  data  and  imagery
that  are  used  by  weather  forecasters,  climatologists,  and  the  military  to  map  and
monitor  changes  in  weather,  climate,  the  oceans,  and  the  environment.  The
NPOESS program is considered critical to the United States’ ability to maintain the
continuity of data required for weather forecasting (including severe weather events
such as hurricanes) and global climate monitoring through the year 2026.

Three  agencies  share  responsibility  for  the  NPOESS  program:  the  Department  of
Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Depart-
ment  of  Defense  (DOD)/United  States  Air  Force,  and  the  National  Aeronautics  and
Space Administration (NASA). To manage the NPOESS program, these agencies es-
tablished  a  tri-agency  integrated  program  office.  In  recent  years,  the  program  has
experienced escalating costs, schedule delays, and technical difficulties, which led to
a June 2006 decision to restructure it. This decision decreased the complexity of the
program  by  reducing  the  number  of  satellites  and  sensors,  increased  the  estimated
cost  of  the  program  to  $12.5  billion,  and  delayed  the  launches  of  the  first  two  sat-
ellites by three and five years, respectively.

As  requested,  this  statement  summarizes  a  report  being  released  today  that  (1)
assesses the NPOESS program office’s progress in restructuring the acquisition, (2)
evaluates  the  program  office’s  progress  in  establishing  an  effective  management
structure, and (3) identifies the status and key risks facing the program’s major seg-
ments.1 The  report  includes  recommendations  to  NOAA,  NASA,  and  DOD  to  facili-
tate the restructuring of the program and to reduce program risks. In preparing this
testimony,  we  relied  on  our  work  supporting  the  accompanying  report.  That  report
contains  a  detailed  overview  of  our  scope  and  methodology.  All  the  work  on  which
this  testimony  is  based  was  performed  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  gov-
ernment auditing standards.

Results in Brief

23

The  NPOESS  program  office  has  made  progress  in  restructuring  the  acquisition
by  establishing  and  implementing  interim  program  plans  guiding  contractors’  work
activities  in  2006  and  2007;  however,  important  tasks  remain  to  be  done.  Although
the  program  office  developed  key  acquisition  documents  (including  a  memorandum
of agreement on the roles and responsibilities of the three agencies, a revised acqui-
sition  strategy,  and  a  system  engineering  plan)  the  responsible  executives  in  the
three agencies have not yet approved these documents—even though they were due
by  September  1,  2006.  Delays  in  finalizing  these  documents  could  hinder  plans  to
complete contract negotiations by July 2007 and could keep the program from mov-
ing forward in fiscal year 2008 with a new program baseline.

The  program  office  has  also  made  progress  in  establishing  an  effective  manage-
ment  structure  by  adopting  a  new  organizational  framework  with  increased  over-
sight  from  program  executives  and  by  instituting  more  frequent  and  rigorous  pro-
gram  management  reviews;  however,  planned  changes  in  executive  management
will likely increase program risk. Additionally, the program lacks a process and plan
for identifying and filling staffing shortages, which has led to delays in key activities
such  as  cost  estimating  and  contract  revisions.  As  of  June  2007,  key  positions  re-
main to be filled.

Development  and  testing  of  major  program  segments—including  key  sensors  and
the  ground  systems—are  under  way,  but  significant  risks  remain.  For  example,
work continues on key sensors, but two sensors—the visible/infrared imager radiom-
eter suite and the crosstrack infrared sounder—have continued to experience signifi-
cant difficulties. Additionally, while significant progress has been made in reducing
delays  in  the  NPOESS  data  processing  system,  much  work  remains  in  refining  the
algorithms  needed  to  translate  sensor  observations  into  usable  weather  products.
Continued  sensor  problems  could  cause  further  cost  increases  or  schedule  delays.
Given  the  tight  time  frames  for  completing  key  sensors,  integrating  them  with  the
demonstration spacecraft (called the NPOESS Preparatory Project or NPP), and de-
veloping,  testing,  and  deploying  the  ground-based  data  processing  systems,  it  will
be  important  for  the  Integrated  Program  Office,  the  Program  Executive  Office,  and
the  Executive  Committee  to  continue  to  provide  close  oversight  of  milestones  and
risks.

In our report, we made recommendations to the Secretaries of Commerce and De-
fense  and  to  the  Administrator  of  NASA  to  ensure  that  the  appropriate  executives
finalize  key  acquisition  documents  in  order  to  allow  the  restructuring  of  the  pro-
gram  to  proceed.  We  made  recommendations  to  the  Secretary  of  Defense  to  direct
the Air Force to delay reassigning the recently appointed Program Executive Officer
until  key  program  risks  are  resolved.  We  also  made  recommendations  to  the  Sec-
retary of Commerce to ensure that NPOESS program authorities develop and imple-
ment a written process for identifying and addressing human capital needs and that
they establish a plan to immediately fill needed positions. In written comments, all
three  agencies  agreed  that  it  was  important  to  finalize  key  acquisition  documents
in  a  timely  manner,  and  DOD  proposed  extending  the  due  dates  for  the  documents
to  July  2,  2007.  In  addition,  the  Department  of  Commerce  concurred  with  our  rec-
ommendation  to  identify  and  address  human  capital  needs  and  immediately  fill
open positions in the NPOESS program office. Commerce noted that NOAA was tak-
ing actions in both areas.

However,  DOD  did  not  concur  with  our  recommendation  to  delay  reassigning  the
Program Executive Officer, noting that the Program Director responsible for the ac-
quisition  program  would  remain  in  place  for  four  years.  While  it  is  important  that
the System Program Director remain in place to ensure continuity in executing the
acquisition,  this  position  does  not  ensure  continuity  in  the  important  oversight  and
coordination  functions  provided  by  the  current  Program  Executive  Officer.  We  re-
main  concerned  that  reassigning  the  Program  Executive  at  a  time  when  NPOESS
is still facing critical cost, schedule, and technical challenges will place the program
at further risk.
Background

Since  the  1960s,  the  United  States  has  operated  two  separate  operational  polar-
orbiting  meteorological  satellite  systems:  the  Polar-orbiting  Operational  Environ-
mental  Satellite  (POES)  series—managed  by  NOAA—and  the  Defense  Meteorolog-
ical  Satellite  Program  (DMSP)—managed  by  the  Air  Force.  These  satellites  obtain

tial  impact  of  severe  weather  so  that  communities  and  emergency  managers  can
help  prevent  and  mitigate  their  effects.  Polar  satellites  also  provide  data  used  to
monitor environmental phenomena, such as ozone depletion and drought conditions,
as  well  as  data  sets  that  are  used  by  researchers  for  a  variety  of  studies  such  as
climate monitoring.
NPOESS Overview

With  the  expectation  that  combining  the  POES  and  DMSP  programs  would  re-
duce  duplication  and  result  in  sizable  cost  savings,  a  May  1994  Presidential  Deci-
sion Directive required NOAA and DOD to converge the two satellite programs into
a  single  satellite  program  capable  of  satisfying  both  civilian  and  military  require-
ments.2 The  converged  program,  NPOESS,  is  considered  critical  to  the  United
States’  ability  to  maintain  the  continuity  of  data  required  for  weather  forecasting
and  global  climate  monitoring  through  the  year  2026.  To  manage  this  program,
DOD,  NOAA,  and  NASA  formed  a  tri-agency  Integrated  Program  Office,  located
within NOAA.

Within  the  program  office,  each  agency  has  the  lead  on  certain  activities:  NOAA
has  overall  program  management  responsibility  for  the  converged  system  and  for
satellite  operations;  DOD  has  the  lead  on  the  acquisition;  and  NASA  has  primary
responsibility for facilitating the development and incorporation of new technologies
into  the  converged  system.  NOAA  and  DOD  share  the  costs  of  funding  NPOESS,
while  NASA  funds  specific  technology  projects  and  studies.  The  NPOESS  program
office is overseen by an Executive Committee, which is made up of the Administra-
tors of NOAA and NASA and the Under Secretary of the Air Force.

NPOESS is a major system acquisition that was originally estimated to cost about
$6.5  billion  over  the  24-year  life  of  the  program  from  its  inception  in  1995  through
2018.  The  program  is  to  provide  satellite  development,  satellite  launch  and  oper-
ation,  and  ground-based  satellite  data  processing.  These  deliverables  are  grouped
into  four  main  categories:  (1)  the  space  segment,  which  includes  the  satellites  and
sensors;  (2)  the  integrated  data  processing  segment,  which  is  the  system  for  trans-
forming raw data into environmental data records (EDR) and is to be located at four
data  processing  centers;  (3)  the  command,  control,  and  communications  segment,
which  includes  the  equipment  and  services  needed  to  support  satellite  operations;
and (4) the launch segment, which includes launch vehicle services.

When  the  NPOESS  engineering,  manufacturing,  and  development  contract  was
awarded  in  August  2002,  the  cost  estimate  was  adjusted  to  $7  billion.  Acquisition
plans called for the procurement and launch of six satellites over the life of the pro-
gram,  as  well  as  the  integration  of  13  instruments—consisting  of  10  environmental
sensors  and  three  subsystems.  Together,  the  sensors  were  to  receive  and  transmit
data on atmospheric, cloud cover, environmental, climatic, oceanographic, and solar-
geophysical observations. The subsystems were to support non-environmental search
and rescue efforts, sensor survivability, and environmental data collection activities.
The program office considered four of the sensors to be critical because they provide
data for key weather products; these sensors are in bold in Table 1, which describes
each of the expected NPOESS instruments.

In  addition,  a  demonstration  satellite  (called  the  NPOESS  Preparatory  Project  or
NPP)  was  planned  to  be  launched  several  years  before  the  first  NPOESS  satellite
in  order  to  reduce  the  risk  associated  with  launching  new  sensor  technologies  and
to ensure continuity of climate data with NASA’s Earth Observing System satellites.
NPP is to host three of the four critical NPOESS sensors (VIIRS, CrIS, and ATMS),
as well as one other noncritical sensor (OMPS). NPP is to provide the program office
and  the  processing  centers  an  early  opportunity  to  work  with  the  sensors,  ground
control, and data processing systems.

When  the  NPOESS  development  contract  was  awarded,  the  schedule  for  launch-
ing  the  satellites  was  driven  by  a  requirement  that  the  satellites  be  available  to
back  up  the  final  POES  and  DMSP  satellites  should  anything  go  wrong  during  the
planned  launches  of  these  satellites.  Early  program  milestones  included  (1)  launch-
ing  NPP  by  May  2006,  (2)  having  the  first  NPOESS  satellite  available  to  back  up
the final POES satellite launch in March 2008, and (3) having the second NPOESS
satellite  available  to  back  up  the  final  DMSP  satellite  launch  in  October  2009.  If
the  NPOESS  satellites  were  not  needed  to  back  up  the  final  predecessor  satellites,
their  anticipated  launch  dates  would  have  been  April  2009  and  June  2011,  respec-
tively.
NPOESS Experienced Cost Increases, Schedule Delays, and Technical Prob-

lems Over Several Years

Over  the  last  few  years,  NPOESS  has  experienced  continued  cost  increases  and
schedule  delays,  requiring  difficult  decisions  to  be  made  about  the  program’s  direc-
tion  and  capabilities.  In  2003,  we  reported  that  changes  in  the  NPOESS  funding
stream led the program to develop a new program cost and schedule baseline.3 After
this  new  baseline  was  completed  in  2004,  we  reported  that  the  program  office  in-
creased the NPOESS cost estimate from about $7 billion to $8.1 billion; delayed key
milestones,  including  the  planned  launch  of  the  first  NPOESS  satellite—which  was
delayed by seven months; and extended the life of the program from 2018 to 2020.4
At  that  time,  we  also  noted  that  other  factors  could  further  affect  the  revised  cost
and  schedule  estimates.  Specifically,  the  contractor  was  not  meeting  expected  cost
and schedule targets on the new baseline because of technical issues in the develop-
ment  of  key  sensors,  including  the  critical  VIIRS  sensor.  Based  on  its  performance
through  May  2004,  we  estimated  that  the  contractor  would  most  likely  overrun  its
contract  at  completion  in  September  2011  by  $500  million—thereby  increasing  the

projected  life  cycle  cost  to  $8.6  billion.  The  program  office’s  baseline  cost  estimate
was subsequently adjusted to $8.4 billion.

In  mid-November  2005,  we  reported  that  NPOESS  continued  to  experience  prob-
lems  in  the  development  of  a  key  sensor,  resulting  in  schedule  delays  and  antici-
pated  cost  increases.5 At  that  time,  we  projected  that  the  program’s  cost  estimate
had  grown  to  about  $10  billion  based  on  contractor  cost  and  schedule  data.  We  re-
ported  that  the  program’s  issues  were  due,  in  part,  to  problems  at  multiple  levels
of  management—including  subcontractor,  contractor,  program  office,  and  executive
leadership.  Recognizing  that  the  budget  for  the  program  was  no  longer  executable,
the  NPOESS  Executive  Committee  planned  to  make  a  decision  in  December  2005
on the future direction of the program—what would be delivered, at what cost, and
by  when.  This  involved  deciding  among  options  involving  increased  costs,  delayed
schedules,  and  reduced  functionality.  We  noted  that  continued  oversight,  strong
leadership,  and  timely  decision-making  were  more  critical  than  ever,  and  we  urged
the committee to make a decision quickly so that the program could proceed.

However,  we  subsequently  reported  that,  in  late  November  2005,  NPOESS  cost
growth exceeded a legislatively mandated threshold that requires DOD to certify the
program  to  Congress.6 This  placed  any  decision  about  the  future  direction  of  the
program  on  hold  until  the  certification  took  place  in  June  2006.  In  the  meantime,
the program office implemented an interim program plan for fiscal year 2006 to con-
tinue work on key sensors and other program elements using fiscal year 2006 fund-
ing.
Nunn-McCurdy Process Led to a Decision to Restructure the NPOESS Pro-

gram

The  Nunn-McCurdy  law  requires  DOD  to  take  specific  actions  when  a  major  de-
fense  acquisition  program  exceeds  certain  cost  increase  thresholds.7 The  law  re-
quires the Secretary of Defense to notify Congress when a major defense acquisition
is  expected  to  overrun  its  project  baseline  by  15  percent  or  more  and  to  certify  the
program  to  Congress  when  it  is  expected  to  overrun  its  baseline  by  25  percent  or
more.8 In  late  November  2005,  NPOESS  exceeded  the  25  percent  threshold,  and
DOD  was  required  to  certify  the  program.  Certifying  a  program  entailed  providing
a  determination  that  (1)  the  program  is  essential  to  national  security,  (2)  there  are
no alternatives to the program that will provide equal or greater military capability
at less cost, (3) the new estimates of the program’s cost are reasonable, and (4) the
management  structure  for  the  program  is  adequate  to  manage  and  control  costs.
DOD  established  tri-agency  teams—made  up  of  DOD,  NOAA,  and  NASA  experts—
to work on each of the four elements of the certification process.

In  June  2006,  DOD  (with  the  agreement  of  both  of  its  partner  agencies)  certified
a  restructured  NPOESS  program,  estimated  to  cost  $12.5  billion  through  2026.9
This decision approved a cost increase of $4 billion over the prior approved baseline
cost  and  delayed  the  launch  of  NPP  and  the  first  two  satellites  by  roughly  three
to five years. The new program also entailed establishing a stronger program man-
agement  structure,  reducing  the  number  of  satellites  to  be  produced  and  launched
from  six  to  four,  and  reducing  the  number  of  instruments  on  the  satellites  from  13
to  nine—consisting  of  seven  environmental  sensors  and  two  subsystems.  It  also  en-
tailed using NPOESS satellites in the early morning and afternoon orbits and rely-
ing  on  European  satellites  for  midmorning  orbit  data.10 Table  2  summarizes  the
major program changes made under the Nunn-McCurdy certification decision.

9 DOD estimated that the acquisition portion of the certified program would cost $11.5 billion.
The  acquisition  portion  includes  satellite  development,  production,  and  launch,  but  not  oper-
ations  and  support  costs  after  launch.  When  combined  with  an  estimated  $1  billion  for  oper-
ations and support after launch, this brings the program life cycle cost to $12.5 billion.

The Nunn-McCurdy certification decision established new milestones for the deliv-
ery  of  key  program  elements,  including  launching  NPP  by  January  2010,11 launch-
ing the first NPOESS satellite (called C1) by January 2013, and launching the sec-
ond  NPOESS  satellite  (called  C2)  by  January  2016.  These  revised  milestones  devi-
ated  from  prior  plans  to  have  the  first  NPOESS  satellite  available  to  back  up  the
final POES satellite should anything go wrong during that launch.

Delaying  the  launch  of  the  first  NPOESS  satellite  means  that  if  the  final  POES
satellite fails on launch, satellite data users would need to rely on the existing con-
stellation  of  environmental  satellites  until  NPP  data  become  available—almost  two
years  later.  Although  NPP  was  not  intended  to  be  an  operational  asset,  NASA
agreed  to  move  NPP  to  a  different  orbit  so  that  its  data  would  be  available  in  the
event of a premature failure of the final POES satellite. However, NPP will not pro-
vide  all  of  the  operational  capability  planned  for  the  NPOESS  spacecraft.  If  the
health  of  the  existing  constellation  of  satellites  diminishes—or  if  NPP  data  are  not
available, timely, and reliable—then there could be a gap in environmental satellite
data. Table 3 summarizes changes in key program milestones over time.

In  order  to  reduce  program  complexity,  the  Nunn-McCurdy  certification  decision
decreased  the  number  of  NPOESS  sensors  from  13  to  nine  and  reduced  the
functionality of four sensors. Specifically, of the 13 original sensors, five sensors re-
main  unchanged,  three  were  replaced  with  less  capable  sensors,  one  was  modified
to  provide  less  functionality,  and  four  were  canceled.  Table  4  shows  the  changes  to
NPOESS sensors, including the four identified in bold as critical sensors.

11 According  to  program  officials,  although  the  Nunn-McCurdy  certification  decision  specifies
that NPP is to launch by January 2010, NASA plans to launch it by September 2009 to reduce
the possibility of a climate data continuity gap.

The changes in NPOESS sensors affected the number and quality of the resulting
weather  and  environmental  products,  called  environmental  data  records  or  EDRs.
In  selecting  sensors  for  the  restructured  program,  the  agencies  placed  the  highest
priority  on  continuing  current  operational  weather  capabilities  and  a  lower  priority
on obtaining selected environmental and climate measuring capabilities. As a result,
the revised NPOESS system has significantly less capability for providing global cli-
mate  measures  than  was  originally  planned.  Specifically,  the  number  of  EDRs  was
decreased  from  55  to  39,  of  which  six  are  of  a  reduced  quality.  The  39  EDRs  that
remain  include  cloud  base  height,  land  surface  temperature,  precipitation  type  and
rate, and sea surface winds. The 16 EDRs that were removed include cloud particle
size and distribution, sea surface height, net solar radiation at the top of the atmos-
phere,  and  products  to  depict  the  electric  fields  in  the  space  environment.  The  six
EDRs that are of a reduced quality include ozone profile, soil moisture, and multiple
products depicting energy in the space environment.
NPOESS  Acquisition  Restructuring  Is  Well  Under  Way,  But  Key  Steps  Re-

main to Be Completed

Since  the  June  2006  decision  to  revise  the  scope,  cost,  and  schedule  of  the
NPOESS  program,  the  program  office  has  made  progress  in  restructuring  the  sat-
ellite  acquisition;  however,  important  tasks  remain  to  be  done.  Restructuring  a
major acquisition program like NPOESS is a process that involves identifying time-
critical  and  high-priority  work  and  keeping  this  work  moving  forward,  while  reas-
sessing  development  priorities,  inter-dependencies,  deliverables,  risks,  and  costs.  It
also  involves  revising  important  acquisition  documents  including  the  memorandum
of  agreement  on  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  three  agencies,  the  acquisition
strategy, the system engineering plan, the test and evaluation master plan, the inte-
grated master schedule defining what needs to happen by when, and the acquisition
program baseline. Specifically, the Nunn-McCurdy certification decision required the
Secretaries  of  Defense  and  Commerce  and  the  Administrator  of  NASA  to  sign  a  re-
vised  memorandum  of  agreement  by  August  6,  2006.  It  also  required  that  the  pro-
gram office, Program Executive Officer, and the Executive Committee revise and ap-
prove key acquisition documents including the acquisition strategy and system engi-
neering plan by September 1, 2006, in order to proceed with the restructuring. Once
these are completed, the program office can proceed to negotiate with its prime con-
tractor  on  a  new  program  baseline  defining  what  will  be  delivered,  by  when,  and
at what cost.

The  NPOESS  program  office  has  made  progress  in  restructuring  the  acquisition.
Specifically,  the  program  office  has  established  interim  program  plans  guiding  the
contractor’s  work  activities  in  2006  and  2007  and  has  made  progress  in  imple-
menting these plans. The program office and contractor also developed an integrated
master  schedule  for  the  remainder  of  the  program—beyond  fiscal  year  2007.  This
integrated  master  schedule  details  the  steps  leading  up  to  launching  NPP  by  Sep-
tember 2009, launching the first NPOESS satellite in January 2013, and launching
the  second  NPOESS  satellite  in  January  2016.  Near-term  steps  include  completing
and testing the VIIRS, CrIS, and OMPS sensors; integrating these sensors with the
NPP  spacecraft  and  completing  integration  testing;  completing  the  data  processing
system and integrating it with the command, control, and communications segment;
and  performing  advanced  acceptance  testing  of  the  overall  system  of  systems  for
NPP.

However,  key  steps  remain  for  the  acquisition  restructuring  to  be  completed.  Al-
though the program office made progress in revising key acquisition documents, in-
cluding  the  system  engineering  plan,  the  test  and  evaluation  master  plan,  and  the
acquisition  strategy  plan,  it  has  not  yet  obtained  the  approval  of  the  Secretaries  of
Commerce  and  Defense  and  the  Administrator  of  NASA  on  the  memorandum  of
agreement  among  the  three  agencies,  nor  has  it  obtained  the  approval  of  the
NPOESS  Executive  Committee  on  the  other  key  acquisition  documents.  As  of  June
2007,  these  approvals  are  over  nine  months  past  due.  Agency  officials  noted  that
the September 1, 2006, due date for the key acquisition documents was not realistic
given the complexity of coordinating documents among three different agencies.

Finalizing these documents is critical to ensuring interagency agreement and will
allow  the  program  office  to  move  forward  in  completing  other  activities  related  to
restructuring  the  program.  These  other  activities  include  completing  an  integrated
baseline  review  with  the  contractor  to  reach  agreement  on  the  schedule  and  work
activities,  and  finalizing  changes  to  the  NPOESS  development  and  production  con-
tract. Program costs are also likely to be adjusted during upcoming negotiations on
contract  changes—an  event  that  the  Program  Director  expects  to  occur  by  July
2007. Completion of these activities will allow the program office to lock down a new
acquisition baseline cost and schedule. Until key acquisition documents are finalized
and  approved,  the  program  faces  increased  risk  that  it  will  not  be  able  to  complete
important  restructuring  activities  in  time  to  move  forward  in  fiscal  year  2008  with
a  new  program  baseline  in  place.  This  places  the  NPOESS  program  at  risk  of  con-
tinued delays and future cost increases.
Progress Has Been Made in Establishing an Effective NPOESS Management
Structure,  But  Executive  Turnover  Increases  Risks  and  Staffing
Problems Remain

The  NPOESS  program  has  made  progress  in  establishing  an  effective  manage-
ment  structure,  but—almost  a  year  after  this  structure  was  endorsed  during  the
Nunn-McCurdy certification process—the Integrated Program Office still faces staff-
ing  problems.  Over  the  past  few  years,  we  and  others  have  raised  concerns  about
management  problems  at  all  levels  of  the  NPOESS  program,  including  subcon-
tractor  and  contractor  management,  program  office  management,  and  executive-
level management.12 Two independent review teams also noted a shortage of skilled
program staff, including budget analysts and system engineers. Since that time, the
NPOESS  program  has  made  progress  in  establishing  an  effective  management
structure—including  establishing  a  new  organizational  framework  with  increased
oversight  by  program  executives,  instituting  more  frequent  subcontractor,  con-
tractor,  and  program  reviews,  and  effectively  managing  risks  and  performance.
However, DOD’s plans for reassigning the Program Executive Officer in the summer
of 2007 increase the program’s risks. Additionally, the program lacks a staffing proc-
ess  that  clearly  identifies  staffing  needs,  gaps,  and  plans  for  filling  those  gaps.  As
a result, the program office has experienced delays in getting core management ac-
tivities  under  way  and  lacks  the  staff  it  needs  to  execute  day-to-day  management
activities.

NPOESS Program Has Made Progress in Establishing an Effective Manage-
ment Structure and Increasing Oversight Activities, But Executive
Turnover Will Increase Program Risks

The  NPOESS  program  has  made  progress  in  establishing  an  effective  manage-
ment structure and increasing the frequency and intensity of its oversight activities.
Over  the  past  few  years,  we  and  others  have  raised  concerns  about  management
problems  at  all  levels  of  management  on  the  NPOESS  program,  including  subcon-
tractor  and  contractor  management,  program  office  management,  and  executive-
level  management.  In  response  to  recommendations  made  by  two  different  inde-
pendent  review  teams,  the  program  office  began  exploring  options  in  late  2005  and
early 2006 for revising its management structure.

In November 2005, the Executive Committee established and filled a Program Ex-
ecutive Officer position, senior to the NPOESS Program Director, to streamline deci-
sion making and to provide oversight to the program. This Program Executive Offi-
cer reports directly to the Executive Committee. Subsequently, the Program Execu-
tive  Officer  and  the  Program  Director  proposed  a  revised  organizational  framework
that  realigned  division  managers  within  the  Integrated  Program  Office  responsible
for  overseeing  key  elements  of  the  acquisition  and  increased  staffing  in  key  areas.
In  June  2006,  the  Nunn-McCurdy  certification  decision  approved  this  new  manage-
ment  structure  and  the  Integrated  Program  Office  implemented  it.  Figure  1  pro-
vides  an  overview  of  the  relationships  among  the  Integrated  Program  Office,  the
Program  Executive  Office,  and  the  Executive  Committee,  as  well  as  key  divisions
within the program office.

Operating under this new management structure, the program office implemented
more  rigorous  and  frequent  subcontractor,  contractor,  and  program  reviews,  im-
proved  visibility  into  risk  management  and  mitigation  activities,  and  institutional-
ized the use of earned value management techniques to monitor contractor perform-
ance.  In  addition  to  these  program  office  activities,  the  Program  Executive  Officer
implemented monthly program reviews and increased the frequency of contacts with
the Executive Committee. The Program Executive Officer briefs the Executive Com-
mittee  in  monthly  letters,  apprising  committee  members  of  the  program’s  status,
progress,  risks,  and  earned  value,  and  the  Executive  Committee  now  meets  on  a
quarterly  basis—whereas  in  the  recent  past,  we  reported  that  the  Executive  Com-
mittee had met only five times in two years.13

Although  the  NPOESS  program  has  made  progress  in  establishing  an  effective
management structure, this progress is currently at risk. We recently reported that
DOD  space  acquisitions  are  at  increased  risk  due  in  part  to  frequent  turnover  in
leadership  positions,  and  we  suggested  that  addressing  this  will  require  DOD  to

consider  matching  officials’  tenure  with  the  development  or  delivery  of  a  product.14
In March 2007, NPOESS program officials stated that DOD is planning to reassign
the  recently  appointed  Program  Executive  Officer  in  the  summer  2007  as  part  of
this executive’s natural career progression. As of June 2007, the Program Executive
Officer  has  held  this  position  for  19  months.  Given  that  the  program  is  currently
still  being  restructured,  and  that  there  are  significant  challenges  in  being  able  to
meet critical deadlines to ensure satellite data continuity, such a move adds unnec-
essary risk to an already risky program.
NPOESS  Program  Has  Filled  Key  Vacancies  but  Lacks  a  Program-wide

Staffing Process

The  NPOESS  program  office  has  filled  key  vacancies  but  lacks  a  staffing  process
that identifies program-wide staffing requirements and plans for filling those needed
positions. Sound human capital management calls for establishing a process or plan
for  determining  staffing  requirements,  identifying  any  gaps  in  staffing,  and  plan-
ning  to  fill  critical  staffing  gaps.  Program  office  staffing  is  especially  important  for
NPOESS,  given  the  acknowledgment  by  multiple  independent  review  teams  that
staffing  shortfalls  contributed  to  past  problems.  Specifically,  these  review  teams
noted shortages in the number of system engineers needed to provide adequate over-
sight  of  subcontractor  and  contractor  engineering  activities  and  in  the  number  of
budget and cost analysts needed to assess contractor cost and earned value reports.
To  rectify  this  situation,  the  June  2006  certification  decision  directed  the  Program
Director to take immediate actions to fill vacant positions at the program office with
the approval of the Program Executive Officer.

Since  the  June  2006  decision  to  revise  NPOESS  management  structure,  the  pro-
gram  office  has  filled  multiple  critical  positions,  including  a  budget  officer,  a  chief
system  engineer,  an  algorithm  division  chief,  and  a  contracts  director.  In  addition,
on an ad hoc basis, individual division managers have assessed their needs and ini-
tiated plans to hire staff for key positions. However, the program office lacks a pro-
gram-wide  process  for  identifying  and  filling  all  needed  positions.  As  a  result,  divi-
sion  managers  often  wait  months  for  critical  positions  to  be  filled.  For  example,  in
February 2006, the NPOESS program estimated that it needed to hire up to 10 new
budget  analysts.  As  of  September  2006,  none  of  these  positions  had  been  filled.  As
of  April  2007,  program  officials  estimated  that  they  still  needed  to  fill  five  budget
analyst positions, five systems engineering positions, and 10 technical manager posi-
tions.  The  majority  of  the  vacancies—four  of  the  five  budget  positions,  four  of  the
five  systems  engineering  positions,  and  eight  of  the  10  technical  manager  posi-
tions—are  to  be  provided  by  NOAA.  NOAA  officials  noted  that  each  of  these  posi-
tions is in some stage of being filled—that is, recruitment packages are being devel-
oped  or  reviewed,  vacancies  are  being  advertised,  or  candidates  are  being  inter-
viewed, selected, and approved.

The program office attributes its staffing delays to not having the right personnel
in  place  to  facilitate  this  process,  and  it  did  not  even  begin  to  develop  a  staffing
process  until  November  2006.  Program  officials  noted  that  the  tri-agency  nature  of
the  program  adds  unusual  layers  of  complexity  to  the  hiring  and  administrative
functions  because  each  agency  has  its  own  hiring  and  performance  management
rules.  In  November  2006,  the  program  office  brought  in  an  administrative  officer
who took the lead in pulling together the division managers’ individual assessments
of needed staff and has been working with the division managers to refine this list.
This  new  administrative  officer  plans  to  train  division  managers  in  how  to  assess
their  needs  and  to  hire  needed  staff,  and  to  develop  a  process  by  which  evolving
needs  are  identified  and  positions  axe  filled.  However,  there  is  as  yet  no  date  set
for  establishing  this  basic  program-wide  staffing  process.  As  a  result  of  the  lack  of
a  program-wide  staffing  process,  there  has  been  an  extended  delay  in  determining
what staff is needed and in bringing those staff on board; this has resulted in delays
in performing core activities, such as establishing the program office’s cost estimate
and  bringing  in  needed  contracting  expertise.  Additionally,  until  a  program-wide
staffing  process  is  in  place,  the  program  office  risks  not  having  the  staff  it  needs
to execute day-to-day management activities.

In  commenting  on  a  draft  of  our  report,  Commerce  stated  that  NOAA  imple-
mented an accelerated hiring model. More recently, the NPOESS program office re-
ported  that  several  critical  positions  were  filled  in  April  and  May  2007.  However,
we  have  not  yet  evaluated  NOAA’s  accelerated  hiring  model  and,  as  of  June  2007,
over 10 key positions remain to be filled.

Major  Program  Segments  Are  Under  Development,  But  Significant  Risks

Remain

Major segments of the NPOESS program—the space segment and ground systems
segment—are  under  development;  however,  significant  problems  have  occurred  and
risks remain. The program office is aware of these risks and is working to mitigate
them,  but  continued  problems  could  affect  the  program’s  overall  cost  and  schedule.
Given  the  tight  time  frames  for  completing  key  sensors,  integrating  them  on  the
NPP spacecraft, and developing, testing, and deploying the ground-based data proc-
essing systems, it will be important for the NPOESS Integrated Program Office, the
Program Executive Office, and the Executive Committee to continue to provide close
oversight of milestones and risks.
Space Segment—Progress Made, But Key Sensors Continue to Face Major Risks

The  space  segment  includes  the  sensors  and  the  spacecraft.  Four  sensors  are  of
critical  importance—VIIRS,  CrIS,  OMPS,  and  ATMS—because  they  are  to  be
launched  on  the  NPP  satellite  in  September  2009.  Initiating  work  on  another  sen-
sor,  the  Microwave  imager/sounder,  is  also  important  because  this  new  sensor—re-
placing the canceled CMIS sensor—will need to be developed in time for the second
NPOESS  satellite  launch.  Over  the  past  year,  the  program  made  progress  on  each
of  the  sensors  and  the  spacecraft.  However,  two  sensors,  VIIRS  and  CrIS,  have  ex-
perienced  major  problems.  The  status  of  each  of  the  components  of  the  space  seg-
ment is described in Table 5.

Program  officials  regularly  track  risks  associated  with  various  NPOESS  compo-
nents  and  work  to  mitigate  them.  Having  identified  both  VIIRS  and  CrIS  as  high
risk,  OMPS  as  moderate  risk,  and  the  other  components  as  low  risk,  the  program
office  is  working  closely  with  the  contractors  and  subcontractors  to  resolve  sensor
problems.  Program  officials  have  identified  work-grounds  that  will  allow  them  to
move  forward  in  testing  the  VIIRS  engineering  unit  and  have  approved  the  flight
unit  to  proceed  to  a  technical  readiness  review  milestone.  Regarding  CrIS,  as  of
March  2007,  a  failure  review  board  identified  root  causes  of  its  structural  failure,
identified plans for resolving them, and initiated inspections of sensor modules and
subsystems  for  damage.  An  agency  official  reported  that  there  is  sufficient  funding

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:15 Jul 23, 2008 Jkt 035707 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\060707\35707 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

33

in  the  fiscal  year  2007  program  office’s  and  contractor’s  management  reserve  funds
to allow for troubleshooting both VIIRS and CrIS problems. However, until the CrIS
failure  review  board  fully  determines  the  amount  of  rework  that  is  necessary  to  fix
the  problems,  it  is  unknown  if  additional  funds  will  be  needed  or  if  the  time  frame
for  CrIS’s  delivery  will  be  delayed.  According  to  agency  officials,  CrIS  is  not  on  the
program  schedule’s  critical  path,  and  there  is  sufficient  schedule  margin  to  absorb
the time it will take to conduct a thorough failure review process.

Managing the risks associated with the development of VIIRS and CrIS is of par-
ticular  importance  because  these  components  are  to  be  demonstrated  on  the  NPP
satellite,  currently  scheduled  for  launch  in  September  2009.  Any  delay  in  the  NPP
launch  date  could  affect  the  overall  NPOESS  program,  because  the  success  of  the
program  depends  on  the  lessons  learned  in  data  processing  and  system  integration
from the NPP satellite. Additionally, continued sensor problems could lead to higher
final program costs.
Ground Segment-Progress Has Been Made, But Work Remains

Development of the ground segment—which includes the interface data processing
system, the ground stations that are to receive satellite data, and the ground-based
command,  control,  and  communications  system—is  under  way  and  on  track.  How-
ever, important work pertaining to developing the algorithms that translate satellite
data  into  weather  products  within  the  integrated  data  processing  segment  remains
to  be  completed.  Table  6  describes  each  of  the  components  of  the  ground  segment
and identifies the status of each.

The NPOESS program office plans to continue to address risks facing IDPS devel-
opment. Specifically, the IDPS team is working to reduce data processing delays by
seeking to limit the number of data calls, improve the efficiency of the data manage-
ment  system,  increase  the  efficiency  of  the  algorithms,  and  increase  the  number  of
processors.  The  program  office  also  developed  a  resource  center  consisting  of  a  log-
ical technical library, a data archive, and a set of analytical tools to coordinate, com-
municate,  and  facilitate  the  work  of  algorithm  subject  matter  experts  on  algorithm
development and calibration/validation preparations. Managing the risks associated
with  the  development  of  the  IDPS  system  is  of  particular  importance  because  this
system will be needed to process NPP data.
Implementation  of  GAO  Recommendations  Should  Reduce  Program  Risks

sure that there are no gaps in the continuity of critical weather and environmental

observations, in our accompanying report15 we made recommendations to the Secre-
taries  of  Defense  and  Commerce  and  to  the  Administrator  of  NASA  to  ensure  that
the responsible executives within their respective organizations approve key acquisi-
tion documents, including the memorandum of agreement among the three agencies,
the  system  engineering  plan,  the  test  and  evaluation  master  plan,  and  the  acquisi-
tion  strategy,  as  quickly  as  possible  but  no  later  than  April  30,  2007.  We  also  rec-
ommended  that  the  Secretary  of  Defense  direct  the  Air  Force  to  delay  reassigning
the recently appointed Program Executive Officer until all sensors have been deliv-
ered to the NPOESS Preparatory Program; these deliveries are currently scheduled
to  occur  by  July  2008.  We  also  made  two  additional  recommendations  to  the  Sec-
retary  of  Commerce  to  (1)  develop  and  implement  a  written  process  for  identifying
and addressing human capital needs and for streamlining how the program handles
the  three  different  agencies’  administrative  procedures  and  (2)  establish  a  plan  for
immediately filling needed positions.

In  written  comments,  all  three  agencies  agreed  that  it  was  important  to  finalize
key  acquisition  documents  in  a  timely  manner,  and  DOD  proposed  extending  the
due  dates  for  the  documents  to  July  2,  2007.  Because  the  NPOESS  program  office
intends to complete contract negotiations by July 4, 2007, we remain concerned that
any  further  delays  in  approving  the  documents  could  delay  contract  negotiations
and thus increase the risk to the program.

In addition, the Department of Commerce agreed with our recommendation to de-
velop and implement a written process for identifying and addressing human capital
needs  and  to  streamline  how  the  program  handles  the  three  different  agencies’  ad-
ministrative  procedures.  The  department  also  agreed  with  our  recommendation  to
plan  to  immediately  fill  open  positions  at  the  NPOESS  program  office.  Commerce
noted  that  NOAA  identified  the  skill  sets  needed  for  the  program  and  has  imple-
mented  an  accelerated  hiring  model  and  schedule  to  fill  all  NOAA  positions  in  the
NPOESS  program.  Commerce  also  noted  that  NOAA  has  made  NPOESS  hiring  a
high priority and has documented a strategy—including milestones—to ensure that
all NOAA positions are filled by June 2007.

DOD  did  not  concur  with  our  recommendation  to  delay  reassigning  the  Program
Executive Officer, noting that the NPOESS System Program Director responsible for
executing  the  acquisition  program  would  remain  in  place  for  4  years.  The  Depart-
ment  of  Commerce  also  noted  that  the  Program  Executive  Officer  position  is
planned  to  rotate  between  the  Air  Force  and  NOAA.  Commerce  also  stated  that  a
selection would be made before the departure of the current Program Executive Offi-
cer  to  provide  an  overlap  period  to  allow  for  knowledge  transfer  and  ensure  con-
tinuity.  However,  over  the  last  few  years,  we  and  others  (including  an  independent
review team and the Commerce Inspector General) have reported that ineffective ex-
ecutive-level oversight helped foster the NPOESS program’s cost and schedule over-
runs. We remain concerned that reassigning the Program Executive at a time when
NPOESS is still facing critical cost, schedule, and technical challenges will place the
program at further risk.

In  addition,  while  it  is  important  that  the  System  Program  Director  remain  in
place to ensure continuity in executing the acquisition, this position does not ensure
continuity  in  the  functions  of  the  Program  Executive  Officer.  The  current  Program
Executive  Officer  is  experienced  in  providing  oversight  of  the  progress,  issues,  and
challenges facing NPOESS and coordinating with Executive Committee members as
well as the Defense acquisition authorities. Additionally, while the Program Execu-
tive  Officer  position  is  planned  to  rotate  between  agencies,  the  memorandum  of
agreement  documenting  this  arrangement  is  still  in  draft  and  should  be  flexible
enough to allow the current Program Executive Officer to remain until critical risks
have been addressed.

Further, while Commerce plans to allow a period of overlap between the selection
of  a  new  Program  Executive  Officer  and  the  departure  of  the  current  one,  time  is
running  out.  The  current  Program  Executive  Officer  is  expected  to  depart  in  early
July 2007, and as of early June 2007, a successor has not yet been named. NPOESS
is  an  extremely  complex  acquisition,  involving  three  agencies,  multiple  contractors,
and  advanced  technologies.  There  is  not  sufficient  time  to  transfer  knowledge  and
develop  the  sound  professional  working  relationships  that  the  new  Program  Execu-
tive Officer will need to succeed in that role. Thus, we remain convinced that given
NPOESS  current  challenges,  reassigning  the  current  Program  Executive  Officer  at
this time would not be appropriate.

In  summary,  NPOESS  restructuring  is  well  under  way,  and  the  program  has
made  progress  in  establishing  an  effective  management  structure.  However,  key
steps remain in restructuring the acquisition, including completing important acqui-

15 GAO–07–498.

sition  documents  such  as  the  system  engineering  plan,  the  acquisition  program
baseline, and the memorandum of agreement documenting the three agencies’ roles
and responsibilities. Until these key documents are finalized, the program is unable
to finalize plans for restructuring the program. Additionally, the program office con-
tinues to have difficulty filling key positions and lacks a program-wide staffing proc-
ess.  Until  the  program  establishes  an  effective  and  repeatable  staffing  process,  it
will have difficulties in identifying and filling its staffing needs in a timely manner.
Having insufficient staff in key positions impedes the program office’s ability to con-
duct  important  management  and  oversight  activities,  including  revising  cost  and
schedule  estimates,  monitoring  progress,  and  managing  technical  risks.  The  pro-
gram faces even further challenges if DOD proceeds with plans to reassign the Pro-
gram  Executive  Officer  this  summer.  Such  a  move  would  add  unnecessary  risk  to
an already risky program.

In  addition,  the  likelihood  exists  that  there  will  be  further  cost  increases  and
schedule  delays  because  of  technical  problems  on  key  sensors  and  pending  contract
negotiations. Major program segments—including the space and ground segments—
are making progress in their development and testing. However, two critical sensors
have experienced problems and are considered high risk, and risks remain in devel-
oping  and  implementing  the  ground-based  data  processing  system.  Given  the  tight
time  frames  for  completing  key  sensors,  integrating  them,  and  getting  the  ground-
based data processing systems developed, tested, and deployed, continued close over-
sight  of  milestones  and  risks  is  essential  to  minimize  potential  cost  increases  and
schedule delays.

Mr.  Chairman,  this  concludes  my  statement.  I  would  be  happy  to  answer  any

questions that you or Members of the Committee may have at this time.

Other key contributors to this testimony include Colleen Phillips (Assistant Direc-

tor), Carol Cha, and Teresa Smith.

to address you today.

I  am  responsible  for  a  portfolio  of  a  program  that  includes  the
orbital  operations  of  the  Defense  Meteorological  Satellite  Program
and  the  development  of  the  NPOESS  program.  I  report  to  the  Ad-

ministrator of NASA, the Under Secretary of the Air Force, and the
Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere. I appre-
ciate  this  opportunity  to  discuss  with  you  the  status  of  the
NPOESS  program  and  thank  you  for  your  continued  interest  and
support.

In  response  to  the  questions  that  you  sent  in  your  letter  of  invi-
tation  concerning  the  latest  status  of  the  program,  the  first  ques-
tion  was  when  will  the  new  program  baseline  be  finalized,  and
when  will  the  contractor  renegotiations  be  completed.  A  new  pro-
gram baseline is finalized. The integrated baseline review, our final
step,  was  completed  last  week,  and  the  restructure  proposal  was
received  from  the  contractor,  and  fact  finding  is,  in  fact,  complete.
Negotiations should conclude with a contract in July.

Your  second  question  was  what  is  the  current  status  of  the  key
NPOESS  sensors,  and  when  will  the  flight  units  be  delivered  for
incorporation on NPP. The two key sensors as mentioned by David
Powner,  are,  in  fact,  the  Visible/Infrared  Radiometer  Suite,  or
VIIRS,  and  the  Cross-track  Infrared  Sounder,  or  CrIS.  Let  me  ad-
dress the VIIRS first.

I commissioned an independent review team to look at the suffi-
ciency  of  the  VIIRS  design.  The  team  came  back—when  they  re-
ported  out—that  said  the  design  was  basically  sound  and  will
produce operational weather data to the expected levels. The flight
unit  has  recently  completed  the  test  readiness  review,  and  we  will
soon  initiate  acceptance  testing  leading  to  its  delivery  in  the  sum-
mer of 2008, for NPP.

With respect to the Cross-track Infrared Sounder, or CrIS, it ex-
perienced a structural failure in the final seconds of vibration test-
ing  in  October.  A  Joint  Failure  Review  Board  has  determined  the
root  cause  of  this  failure,  and  a  systemic  exoneration  of  all  compo-
nents is ongoing. This thorough process has produced confidence in
the flight unit, and this unit will resume testing at the system level
upon  receipt  of  a  strengthened  frame,  supporting  delivery  in  the
summer of 2008.

Your  third  question  was  what  progress  has  been  made  on  defin-
ing  the  microwave  sensor  that  replaces  the  canceled  CMIS  instru-
ment. A Request For Information, or RFI, was released to industry
late last year and based upon the data received from that data call,
a detailed specification is being developed that will meet or exceed
the  threshold  requirements  for  this  instrument.  A  new  microwave
sensor  program  will  be  reviewed  by  my  replacement  and  the
EXCOM9 in  September  and,  with  the  EXCOM’s  concurrence,  a  re-
quest for proposal will be released in FY 2008.

Your final question was are the program and instrument contrac-
tors  currently  meeting  the  milestones  set  out  in  the  fiscal  year
2007 interim program plan. In short, yes. The contractors are doing
well in meeting their cost and schedule commitments for the fiscal
year  2007  interim  program  plan.  Northrop  Grumman  Space  Tech-
nology  (NGST)  is  currently  slightly  ahead  of  plan,  having  com-
pleted 122 milestones, where only 120 were scheduled.

With respect to the GAO report, it should be noted that the GAO
staff has maintained a close vigilance of the NPOESS program and

attends  my  monthly  program  management  reviews.  Their  under-
standing of the program was evident in their recent report, and we
completely  agree  that  technical  challenges  and  risks  remain.  And
we  are  gratified  to  see  that  the  GAO  notes  that  management
changes put in place over the last year are paying dividends. Man-
agement  changes  that  we  and  the  NPOESS  prime  contractor,
NGST,  have  undertaken  are  widespread  and  affect  every  aspect  of
the  execution  of  this  complex  satellite  development.  In  fact,  it  is  a
complete change of approach as we move ‘‘back to basics.’’

This  is  as  the  government  assumes  a  far  more  active  role  in  the
verification  of  all  data  and  test  results.  This  required  significant
staff additions that have been strongly supported by all three agen-
cies. They are looking for truly talented and experienced space peo-
ple,  and  they  are  truly  hard  to  come  by.  We  currently  have  a  few
vacancies in work but all necessary actions are progressing.

In  conclusion,  NPOESS  is  one  of  the  most  complex  environ-
mental satellite systems ever developed. The management changes
that  the  Government  and  our  prime  contractor  have  put  in  place
are  making  a  difference.  But  please  remember  we  are  building
some  truly  complex  instruments.  We  have  structured  a  stringent
test  program  to  uncover  problems  on  the  ground  rather  than  in
orbit.  We  are  structuring  the  program  to  respond  rapidly  to  any
problems  with  sufficient  margin  to  accommodate  the  difficulties
that will arise.

Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF BRIGADIER GENERAL SUSAN K. MASHIKO

Introduction

Chairmen Lampson and Miller, Ranking Members Inglis and Sensenbrenner, and
Members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to provide an update of our
progress on the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System
(NPOESS)  and  to  comment  on  the  recommendations  of  the  recent  Government  Ac-
countability Office (GAO) report.

I  am  Brigadier  General  Susan  K.  Mashiko,  Program  Executive  Officer  for  Envi-
ronmental Satellites. I report to the Executive Committee of the NPOESS Program
which is comprised of the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration  (NASA),  the  Under  Secretary  of  Commerce  for  Oceans  and  Atmos-
phere, and the Under Secretary of the Air Force. I oversee the day-to-day operations
of the NPOESS Program and interface with other government agencies and depart-
ments and international partners. I am here today to give you an update on the pro-
gram status and to address the recent GAO report.
Program Background

First  let  me  review  what  NPOESS  is  for  the  new  Committee  Members.  In  1994,
after  a  thorough  review  and  serious  consideration,  President  Clinton  directed  the
merger  of  the  military  and  civilian  operational  polar  satellite  programs.  This  new
program,  NPOESS,  is  responsible  for  developing  the  next  generation  of  polar  sat-
ellites  and  sensors.  The  program  was  designed  as  a  series  of  six  satellites  and  a
total of 10 environmental sensors, five of which represent significant advances over
current  operational  satellite  technology.  The  new  NPOESS  sensors  will  provide
higher quality data than the current operational meteorological satellites leading to
more sophisticated environmental models for weather, climate and the oceans.

The NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) is a joint mission involving the National
Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA)  and  the  NPOESS  Integrated  Pro-
gram  Office  (IPO).  The  NPP  mission  will  collect  and  distribute  remotely-sensed
land,  ocean,  and  atmospheric  data  to  the  meteorological  and  global  climate  change
communities  as  the  responsibility  for  these  measurements  transitions  from  NASA’s
existing  Earth-observing  missions  (e.g.,  Aqua,  Terra  and  Aura)  to  the  NPOESS.
NPP  also  provides  risk  reduction  by  testing  several  new  sensors  in  space,  ensure
the ground control systems work properly, and allow us time to assimilate the new

data  into  computer  weather  models  before  launch  of  the  first  operational  NPOESS
satellite.  NPP  will  provide  atmospheric  and  sea  surface  temperatures,  humidity
sounding,  land  and  ocean  biological  productivity,  and  cloud  and  aerosol  properties.
NPOESS is being acquired using DOD acquisition authorities and is managed by
an  Integrated  Program  Office  (IPO).  In  2002,  Northrop  Grumman  was  selected  as
the  NPOESS  prime  contractor  for  spacecraft  development,  ground  systems,  sensor
integration, and operations.

As  many  on  this  committee  are  aware,  in  December  2005,  the  IPO  notified  the
Air  Force  that  projected  cost  overruns  would  exceed  the  25  percent  threshold  trig-
gering  a  breach  of  the  Nunn-McCurdy  statute.  In  June  2006,  following  the  Nunn-
McCurdy  certification  and  resulting  restructure  of  the  NPOESS  program  we  are
moving  forward  with  two  fewer  satellites,  fewer  sensors,  less  risk,  cost  increases,
but  also  with  increases  in  our  confidence  levels  for  timely  delivery  of  core  weather
forecasting  capabilities,  accompanied  by  a  significant  reduction  in  its  climate  moni-
toring capabilities.

The  GAO  report  properly  notes  that  the  NPOESS  program  has  made  progress
since the June 2006 Nunn-McCurdy certification and we completely agree that tech-
nical  challenges  and  risk  still  remain.  The  three  agencies  involved  in  the  NPOESS
development,  the  Department  of  Commerce  (DOC),  the  Department  of  Defense
(DOD),  and  NASA  continue  to  regularly  monitor  the  development  of  the  NPOESS
program. They commit their best talent and participate in the decision-making proc-
ess  through  the  NPOESS  Executive  Committee  (EXCOM).  The  significant  manage-
ment changes and the reduced risk profile resulting from the Nunn-McCurdy certifi-
cation and subsequent restructure have had major positive impacts on the program.
NPOESS  still  remains,  however,  the  most  complex  environmental  satellite  system
ever developed.

Over  the  last  eighteen  months,  the  program  has  taken  a  disciplined  acquisition
approach  to  the  simultaneous  execution  of  the  development  program  and  program
restructure.  Through  the  creation  of  discrete,  measurable,  development  milestones
the  NPOESS  IPO  has  fundamentally  revamped  their  management  style  to  one  of
aggressive oversight of the contractor. This ‘‘back-to-basics’’ approach facilitated the
reorganization  of  both  government  and  industry  management  teams  while  permit-
ting  risk  reduction  to  move  apace.  Most  metrics  for  cost  and  schedule  goals  have
been  achieved  for  this  period.  As  in  all  developmental  programs,  NPOESS  has  un-
covered and addressed new challenges.
Program Status

The  Cross-track  Infrared  Sounder  (CrIS)  is  intended  to  provide  improved  meas-
urements of the temperature and moisture profiles in the atmosphere allowing fore-
casters  to  improve  both  global  and  regional  predictions  of  weather  patterns,  storm
tracks,  and  precipitation.  In  October,  2006,  CrIS  experienced  a  challenge  when  a
structural  component  broke  in  the  final  moments  of  its  vibration  test.  The  failure
was  fully  analyzed  by  a  Tri-Agency  and  industry  team  and  corrective  actions  are
underway.  This  instrument  has  sufficient  schedule  margin  to  ensure  that  the  pro-
jected 2009 launch of the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) and the first NPOESS
satellite in 2013 will not, at this time, be affected.

The  Visible/Infrared  Imager/Radiometer  Suite  (VIIRS)  collects  high  resolution  at-
mospheric  imagery  and  generates  a  variety  of  applied  products,  including  visible
and  infrared  imaging  of  hurricanes  and  detection  of  wildland  fires,  smoke,  and  at-
mospheric aerosols. The VIIRS instrument, which was one of the principal contribu-
tors  to  the  Nunn-McCurdy  breach,  has  completed  extensive  reviews  by  both  a  gov-
ernment  team  from  the  NPOESS  program  and  an  independent  team  of  outside  ex-
perts. Corrective actions for all identified VIIRS instrument problems are underway.
One  major  technical  issue,  optical  cross  talk,  remains  and  we  are  pursing  several
potential solutions. The VIIRS product most at risk at this point is ocean color, but
there are also concerns about the atmospheric aerosol products should the cross talk
problem not be resolved. This key instrument will continue to be the focus of intense
management attention for the foreseeable future.

The  NPOESS  IPO  has  issued  a  request  for  information  for  a  Microwave  Imager/
Sounder  (MIS),  a  smaller,  less  complex  sensor  than  the  original  Conical-scanning
Microwave  Imager/Sounder  (CMIS).  The  MIS  is  still  intended  to  provide  data  for  a
variety  of  products  including  sea  surface  winds.  The  MIS  is  scheduled  to  first  fly
on  the  second  NPOESS  spacecraft  and  then  on  all  subsequent  missions.  A  final  ac-
quisition strategy decision is anticipated by September 2007, at which time cost and
schedule information will be available.

A  number  of  sensors  were  de-manifested  from  NPOESS  as  a  result  of  the  Nunn-
McCurdy  process,  especially  those  oriented  towards  climate  measurements.  At  the
initiative  of  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy  (OSTP),  NASA  and  NOAA

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:15 Jul 23, 2008 Jkt 035707 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\060707\35707 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

39

are working together to identify what might be required to provide flight opportuni-
ties  for  the  de-manifested  sensors—either  on  NPOESS  platforms  or  some  other
method—to  assure  continuity  of  key  climate  parameters  such  as  Earth  radiation
budget,  solar  irradiance,  sea  surface  topography,  ozone  vertical  profile,  and  aerosol
optical properties. OSTP will work with the agencies and the Office of Management
and  Budget  to  determine  if  the  required  resources  can  be  identified  in  the  time
frame required to protect the climate data records.

The ground and data processing system continues to make excellent progress. The
NOAA  Satellite  Operations  Facility  is  up  and  running  and  flying  the  heritage
NOAA and DOD satellites. The command and control software has been fully tested.
Early  versions  of  the  operational  data  processing  system  are  being  tested  with  real
data delivered from satellites currently in orbit.

The  program  restructure  proposal,  which  culminates  10  months  of  intensive  gov-
ernment  and  industry  effort,  details  all  aspects  of  the  NPOESS  program  and  has
been  received  from  Northrop  Grumman  Space  Technology.  This  proposal  provides
detailed  planning,  scheduling  and  resource  allocation  for  the  next  ten  years.  The
proposal  is  presently  in  the  negotiation  process  and  is  on  track  for  a  late  summer
2007 award. Concurrently, the government is conducting an Integrated Baseline Re-
view  (IBR),  which  will  provide  the  government  with  additional  confidence  in  the
Northrop Grumman scheduling and resource allocation process.

The Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) Limb instrument will measure the
vertical  distribution  of  stratospheric  ozone  with  high  resolution;  and  it  will  com-
plement  observations  from  existing  NPOESS  sensors  most  notably  the  column  and
low resolution profile measurements from the OMPS Nadir instrument. In response
to  the  climate  science  community,  NOAA  and  NASA  recently  announced  that  the
OMPS–Limb  will  be  re-manifested  with  the  OMPS  Nadir  onto  the  NPP  in  time  to
meet  the  scheduled  2009  launch  date.  NOAA  and  NASA  have  agreed  to  equally
share  the  cost  of  restoring  the  OMPS–Limb  onto  the  NPP  spacecraft.  The  OMPS–
Limb will measure the vertical distribution of ozone and it will complement observa-
tions from existing NPOESS sensors.
Government Accountability Office (GAO) Recommendations

I  would  like  to  commend  the  GAO  staff  for  their  collaborative  approach  to  the
NPOESS  audits.  I  appreciate  their  commitment  to  providing  recommendations  and
findings  that  will  assist  the  NPOESS  partners.  While  official  comments  have  been
provided  to  GAO,  I’d  like  to  take  the  opportunity  to  provide  a  synopsis  of  our  re-
sponses and the status of addressing the recommendations.

The  GAO  report  emphasizes  the  need  to  expeditiously  complete  the  documenta-
tion  directed  by  the  Acquisition  Decision  Memorandum  for  the  NPOESS  program.
The staffs of the three parent agencies have been fully consulted during the develop-
ment of these documents. These Tri-Agency documents will be fully executed by late
summer.  In  the  interim,  administration  of  the  NPOESS  program  and  the  contract
is not being adversely affected.

The  GAO  report  also  recommends  that  the  Secretary  of  Defense  delay  the  reas-
signment of the NPOESS PEO. While I cannot speak for the DOD, I can state that
the  NPOESS  PEO  position  has  long  been  planned  to  rotate  between  the  Air  Force
and  NOAA.  As  part  of  this  planned  rotation,  the  next  NPOESS  PEO  will  be  a
NOAA employee. A selection is planned prior to my departure in summer 2007 and
is  being  timed  to  provide  a  transition  period  that  will  facilitate  knowledge  transfer
and ensure continuity.

The GAO report recommends that NOAA address the human capital needs for the
NPOESS  program  and  that  it  immediately  fill  needed  positions.  NOAA  has  imple-
mented an accelerated hiring model and corresponding schedule to fill all NOAA po-
sitions  identified  in  the  GAO  report  and  all  positions  needed  by  the  NPOESS  pro-
gram. All three agencies are working in concert and we have identified the positions
to  be  filled,  the  hiring  strategy,  and  other  program  human  capital  needs.  Regular
progress  reporting  on  the  status  of  filling  these  positions  occurs,  and  the  NPOESS
System Program Director reports at monthly meetings with the PEO. NOAA has es-
tablished a complementary, documented strategy with milestones to ensure that all
needed  positions  are  filled.  We  are  working  very  closely  with  the  NOAA  Workforce
Management  Office  to  ensure  obstacles  to  the  hiring  process  are  identified  and  ad-
dressed  immediately.  The  five  additional  NASA  positions  were  identified  as  needed
following the Nunn-McCurdy certification have since been filled.

The  NPOESS  Tri-Agency  partners  are  working  very  hard  to  ensure  the  actions
required to address these recommendations are implemented in a timely manner to
improve our ability to successfully manage the program.

Summary

40

In  summary,  the  management  changes  that  were  established  over  the  last  year
have  taken  hold  and  are  working  at  both  the  government  and  contractor  program
management offices. The test program is identifying problems and that is just what
it  is  designed  to  do.  We  have  added  one  of  the  de-manifested  instruments  onto  the
NPP;  this  type  of  add-back,  if  continued  onto  the  NPOESS  platforms  as  envisioned
by the Nunn-McCurdy analysis. The NPOESS program will continue instrument de-
velopment  to  meet  the  2009  NPP  launch  and  the  2013  launch  of  the  first  NPOESS
satellite.

Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today and I am prepared to an-

swer your questions.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much.  We  will  now  go  into
the  questioning,  the  first  round  of  questions,  and  I  will  recognize
myself for five minutes.

RESTORING ORPHAN SENSORS

Dr.  Marburger,  as  you  note  in  your  testimony  we  have  restored
OMPS–Limb to the Preparatory Project. The Limb sensor is an im-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:15 Jul 23, 2008 Jkt 035707 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\060707\35707 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

portant  component  in  monitoring  the  recovery  of  the  ozone  layer,
which may require collecting data out until 2050. Are we prepared
to put the full ozone sensor back aboard the satellites: according to
the  information  given  to  the  Committee,  removing  them  from  the
program had a $57 million impact or affect?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  The  short  answer  to  that  question,  Congress-
man, is yes. We are committed. It is rated as an important sensor,
and  that  is  the  reason  it  was  put  back  onto  the  NPOESS  mission.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Will  be  on.  Okay.  Your  report  recommends
doing  so.  It  recommends  flying  a  full  OMPS  sensor  aboard  the
NPOESS satellite in 2013.

General Mashiko, we have been told that the program office will

not accept any new instruments for that satellite. Is that true?

Brigadier  General  MASHIKO.  The  manifest  for  Charley  1  or  the
first  flight  version  of  NPOESS  is  locked  down.  Clearly,  I  under-
stand  how  to  take  direction,  but  the  reason  why  we  locked  down
the  configuration  of  the  Charley  1  bird  was  to  reduce  the  overall
risk  to  that  particular  vehicle.  If  you  take  a  look  at  the  satellite
that flies in the afternoon orbit versus the satellite that flies in the
early morning orbit, that is the most complex. It actually has eight
instruments on it, and as such it will be the most complex integra-
tion. And we are clearly biting off the most complex integration. In
order  to  assure  operational  data  continuity,  which  is  my  driving
priority,  I  locked  down  that  configuration.  I  briefed  that,  got
EXCOM concurrence, and I also got the Milestone Decision Author-
ity, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and
Logistics, to concur with that recommendation of locking down that
configuration as soon as possible so that we could keep the configu-
ration of that particular satellite as simple as possible.

Chairman LAMPSON. The United States has obligations under the
1987  Montreal  Protocol  on  ozone,  and  the  OMPS–Limb  helps  us
meet  those  obligations.  We  were  assured  that  NPOESS  was  main-
taining the ability to fly these orphan sensors if someone else built
them and delivered them. The lead time for doing so seemed to be
about  two  years  before  launch.  We  are  six  years  away  from
NPOESS. Can we or can we not do this?

Dr. MARBURGER. There may be confusion about which flights the
OMPS sensor is being restored to. My understanding is it would be
restored to the NPOESS Preparatory Project satellite, the NPP, not
the  C1.  It  is  a  different  satellite  and  which  we  do  understand  is
locked  down.  I  just  wanted  to  make  sure  we  are  talking  about  the
same  satellite  and  that  there  is  no  conflict  between  my  testimony
and General Mashiko’s.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  But  is  there  not  a  desire  to  fly  a  full  set  of

sensors on C1?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  The  idea  is  to  minimize  data  disruption  and
data gaps. We believe that it is appropriate to fly the OMPS–Limb
sensor  on  the  NPP  satellite,  which  will  be  launched  in  2009.  My
understanding  is  that  that  will  address  the  problem  that  we  fore-
saw with the data for that satellite and that the, that obviates the
need to fly it on C1.

If I am mistaken in that, I will be glad to stand corrected, be cor-

rected.

Chairman LAMPSON. The idea——

43

Dr. MARBURGER. But that is my understanding.
Chairman LAMPSON.—from my understanding was to fly another

sensor on C1.

Did you want to make a comment, General Mashiko?
Brigadier  General  MASHIKO.  Sir,  I  would  like  to  make  a  com-
ment. We do—will, in fact, have the OMPS–Nadir sensor on Char-
ley  1,  which  will,  in  fact,  provide  the  necessary  data  in  order  to
meet the Kyoto protocols.

Chairman LAMPSON. If we want to put OMPS 1 back on, can we

do it?

Brigadier  General  MASHIKO.  Physically,  it  can  be  done,  but  it
will  be  done  at  added  risk  to  the  on-time  launch  of  the  first  oper-
ational NPOESS satellite, and it is a risk-benefit equation.
Chairman LAMPSON. And obviously more cost, more time.
Brigadier General MASHIKO. Yes, sir.
Chairman LAMPSON. The second priority listed in the January re-
port  is  the  Earth  Radiation  Budget  Sensor  for  it  measures  how
much of the sun’s radiation gets absorbed by the land. Well, let me
tell  you.  I  am  down  to  my  time.  Let  me—I  am  going  to  stop  and
ask  that  question  in  a  minute,  because  I  would  like  to  get  the
Ranking Member in with his first round of questions.

So, Mr. Inglis.

RISK OF COST OVERRUNS

Mr.  INGLIS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Mr.  Powner,  you  said
that  there  is  some  concern  about  whether  this  can  really  be  done
for $12.5 billion. Will you elaborate on that? What are the risk fac-
tors there?

Mr.  POWNER.  A  couple  key  risk  factors.  One  would  be  the  tech-

nical risks associated with key sensors, in particular VIIRS.

Mr. INGLIS. Uh-huh.
Mr.  POWNER.  That  is  one  reason  why  we  might  see  increased
costs  over  time.  We  have  a  contract  renegotiation  coming  up  here
in  July.  There  is  indications  that  costs  could  be  higher  based  on
that contract renegotiation, and we say that based on some prelimi-
nary  estimates  from  the  contractor  that  are  higher  than  original
estimates,  which  when  you  combine  all  that,  that  pushes  you  over
the $12.5 billion threshold.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Dr.  Marburger,  General  Mashiko,  do  you  have  any
comment on that about those risks? What do you think about that,
the chance of overruns from here?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  I  am  certainly  not  going  to  argue  with  GAO
about  risks  of  cost  overruns.  These  are  expensive,  high-risk
projects,  and  undoubtedly  GAO’s  assessment  needs  to  be  attended
to.  Our  concern  here  is  that  we  move  ahead  with  projects  that  are
essential  for  the  Nation’s  weather  forecasting  capabilities  and  for
the  science  missions,  whether  they  are  performed  using  the
NPOESS set of satellites or some other satellite approach.

Mr. INGLIS. Uh-huh. General Mashiko.
Brigadier General MASHIKO. Well, I do agree with the GAO with
respect  to  the  risks.  There  is  something  that  should  give  yourself
and  the  other  Members  of  the  Committee  some  feeling  of  con-
fidence.  There  are  some  major  cardinal  changes  that  were,  in  fact,
made to the program as part of the restructure, so there are fewer

unknowns  in  the  program—I  guess—is  the  easiest  way  to  look  at
it. Colonel Dan Stockton, who is the System Program Director, and
his  team  laid  out  a  program  that  took  a  six-month  rolling  wave—
traditional  way  of  operating  a  program,  you  only  have  detailed
planning  for  six  months—and  laid  out  detailed  planning  from  the
start  of  the  contract  modification  all  the  way  to  the  conclusion  of
the  contract.  So  they  know  in  detail  everything  that  needs  to  be
done  on  the  program  between  now  and  2016.  There  is  no  task  in
that  program  plan  that  is  longer  than  66  days,  and  they  know  it
with the assurity by having the right people laying out and review-
ing those program plans.

So  that  should  give  the  Committee  some  level  of  confidence  that
while there is still risk associated with the program, it is certainly
better understood than it ever has been in the past.

AVOIDING COST OVERRUNS FOR FUTURE PROGRAMS

Mr.  INGLIS.  You  know,  I  guess  we  could  point  out  that  it  is  not
unusual  for  space  acquisition  programs  to  experience  significant
cost growth. You know, we have had the Space-Based Infrared Sat-
ellite  and  NASA’s  Webb  telescope  are  a  couple  that  were  over.  Is
there  something  that  is  systematically  wrong  or  any  explanation,
any  thoughts  about  what  the  Government  should  be  doing  to  con-
trol  these  costs,  or  is  this  just  something  you’ve  got  to  expect  with
the first-of-a-kind kind of programs?

Brigadier General MASHIKO. They are looking my direction. It is
not  something  that  you  should  necessarily  expect,  but  there  are
certain ground rules that need to be adhered to that we used to do
in the old days of program management, and that is why we often
refer  to  going  back  to  basics.  It  is  truly  understanding  where  you
stand  with  respect  to  technology  maturation.  You  don’t  hold  your
design review too soon. When you put together your initial budgets
for  a  program,  you  put  together  the  initial  budgets  from  the  per-
spective  of  an  independent  cost  estimate  rather  than  a  purely  pro-
gram  office  estimate  or  an  agency  estimate.  You  bring  somebody
else in to take a look at what you are doing and give you an inde-
pendent assessment as to what you think it is going to cost.

And  when  you  do  the  traditional  things  like  that,  the  cost
growths, while they still occur, tend to be smaller, and they are not
quite  as  large,  and  you  don’t  end  up  in  a  Nunn-McCurdy  certifi-
cation situation as this program did in late 2005.

Mr. INGLIS. All right. Mr. Powner.
Mr.  POWNER.  If  I  can  just  comment,  in  terms  of  NPOESS,  what
happened  clearly  with  this,  Ranking  Member  Inglis,  is  we  greatly
underestimated  the  complexity  with  NPOESS.  We  tried  to  address
three agencies’ requirements. That is a difficult thing to do. Clear-
ly, a lot of the climate requirements have lost recently. We are try-
ing  to  restore  those,  and  you  know,  when  you  have  three  agencies
involved,  we  try  to  put  13  sensors  on  a  satellite,  that  is  a  lot.  The
complexity  here  was  huge.  I  mean,  one  of  the  things  we  did  with
Nunn-McCurdy, the decision was to reduce the complexity, and you
know, there are winners and losers here, and you know, with some
of the losers we are trying to reinstate that now. But clearly under-
estimating  the  complexity  and  trying  to  do  too  much  was  a  major
misstep with this program.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Dr.  Marburger,  any  thoughts  about  how  we  can  im-

prove on this?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Well,  clearly,  many  of  the  climate  sensors  that
were  de-manifested  were  added  during  the  growth  of  the  program,
and  one  of  the  reasons  that  we  have  asked  for  additional  informa-
tion  from  NOAA  and  NASA  about  alternatives  other  than
NPOESS—and not immediately rush to put these instruments back
on  NPOESS—is  that  we,  too,  are  concerned  about  the  complexity
that they added to the project and the likelihood that putting them
back  would  just  cause  more  trouble.  So  we  are  looking  at  a  wider
range of possibilities than simply adding them back into NPOESS.
That is why the analysis takes a certain amount of time.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman LAMPSON. I thank the Ranking Member.
We  have  been  called  for  two  votes.  We  don’t  know  exactly  how
much  time.  It  is  probably  about  five  or  six  minutes  remaining  for
the  first  one.  A  second  vote  will  come  shortly  thereafter.  Probably
be 15 to 20 minutes before we get back.

We  will  recess  to  go  vote  and  ask  your  patience  with  us.  Thank

you, and we are in recess.

[Whereupon,  at  1:42  p.m.,  the  Subcommittee  recessed,  to  recon-

vene at 2:12 p.m., the same day.]

Chairman  LAMPSON.  The  Subcommittee  on  Energy  and  Environ-
ment is reconvened, and we left off in the middle of our first round
of questions.

At this time I would recognize Ms. Biggert for five minutes.

DATA GAP CONCERNS

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  my  first  question

is for Dr. Marburger.

I am concerned about the gaps in data that we are currently col-
lecting,  and  this  data  provides  us  with  a  historical  content  that  is
very important as we try to understand the current changes in the
weather  and  the  climate.  Does  the  refigured  program  lead  to  any
gaps in the data?

Dr. MARBURGER. Well, the—as I understand it, the restructuring
occurred—Nunn-McCurdy occurred with the data continuity as one
of the high priorities for consideration. And that has also been the
highest  priority  that  we  have  had  in  mind  in  considering  what  to
do  with  the  sensor  capabilities  that  were  lost  in  the  restructuring.
I think it is important to understand that while the sensors that
are under discussion in this hearing are very important, they actu-
ally  represent  a  small  fraction  of  our  climate  science  and  ocean
science research capabilities. There are many other ways of getting
at  some  of  these  data.  So  we  have  to  consider  it  in  the  context  of
the  literally  dozens  of  other  Earth-observing  satellites.  There  are
approximately  25  satellites  up  there  that  are  collecting  Earth
science  data,  nearly  all  of  which  are  useful  for  climate  science  re-
search  and  some  for  ocean  research  and  some  for  solar  research
and for monitoring the space weather.

So I think perhaps our focus on the instruments on NPOESS has
been  somewhat  misleading  to  the  public  who  may  not  be  aware  of
this vast array of other Earth-observing capabilities.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:15 Jul 23, 2008 Jkt 035707 PO 00000 Frm 00049 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\060707\35707 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

46

So  it  is  primarily  because  of  this  complex  context  of  capabilities
that  we  have  that  we  asked  NOAA  and  NASA  to  perform  these
analyses  that  they  gave  to  us  in  their  white  paper  and  are  con-
tinuing to analyze because we do have other opportunities.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Is  it  more  important,  then,  to  ensure  that  we  get
the sensors into space to avoid the gaps in the weather and climate
data  that  is  currently  being  collected  or  the  sensors  that  collect
new  weather  and  climate  data,  since  you  say  there  are  others.
Shouldn’t  we  wait  until  we  find  another  way  to  test  those  new
ones?

Dr. MARBURGER. Well, I think clearly we want to prioritize these
and we want to make sure that the highest priority sensors for cov-
ering any potential data gaps are flying, either to be re-manifested
on  subsequent  NPOESS  missions,  the  ones  that  are  not  yet  shut
down,  or  on  free-flying  missions  of  their  own.  And  we  are  com-
mitted to minimizing these data gaps to the extent possible, but it
has  to  be  done  in  the  context  of  all  of  these  other  capabilities  that
we have.

But we undoubtedly will have to fly one of these sensors that has
been de-manifested one way or another, and how we go about doing
that is what is at issue here. We need to study that.

INTERAGENCY COLLABORATION: DRAWBACKS

Ms. BIGGERT. Then, Mr. Powner, when this project was originally
started,  it  was  a  weather  project,  wasn’t  it?  I  mean,  did  we  have
the climate included in that?

Mr. POWNER. Well, weather was clearly the focus, but there was
climatological  information  to  be  provided  from  NPOESS  early  on.
Correct.

Ms. BIGGERT. Okay. Do you think that we might have proceeded
at  a  faster  pace  if  we  had  had  just  one  agency  that  was  in  charge
of this?

Mr.  POWNER.  Well,  I  think  clearly  if  you  look  at  the  lessons
learned on NPOESS, I mean, you can go back to where there was,
you  know,  one  of  three,  one  of  the  agencies  didn’t  fully  fund  it.  It
resulted in another agency decreasing funding. Yeah. Having a sin-
gle  agency  program  is  far  less  complex,  not  only  from  some  of  the
administrative  and  executive  level  management  issues,  but  in
terms  of  trying  to  meet  everyone’s  requirements.  That  is  very  dif-
ficult.  And  then  when  you  start  prioritizing,  as  an  example,  you
know,  we  had  55  environmental  data  records  associated  with
NPOESS,  and  we  asked  time  and  time  again  what  are  the  prior-
ities,  and  we  were  always  told  55,  all  55  were  needed.  But  after
Nunn-McCurdy  we  go  down  to  39,  and  you  even  hear  discussions
now  that  there  are  some  that  are  more  important  than  others.  So
there  still  is  a  prioritization,  but  everyone  wants  everything  when
you have three agencies involved, and it makes it very complex.

Ms. BIGGERT. Well, doesn’t every time they make a change or de-
cide  something,  then  three  agencies  having  to  go  back  and  each  of
them  to  make  a  decision  and  then  come  back  and  see  if  they
agreed. It seems that it is such a complex project that it would take
awhile.

And  would  that  increase  the  costs  then,  too?  I  mean,  was  that

one of the things that made it so much more costly?

47

Mr.  POWNER.  Well,  yeah.  Clearly  if  you  look  over  time  with  the
increase  in  costs,  this  started  as  a  $6  billion  program,  and  you
know, now we are at 12.5, so it is doubled, and that was a contrib-
uting factor.

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you. I yield back.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Ms. Biggert.
Mr. Baird, if you are not ready to ask a question, then I will give

myself five minutes.

MORE ON RESTORING ORPHAN SENSORS

Let  me  go  back  to  what  we  had  talked  about  toward  the  end  of
my  questioning  a  while  ago.  OMPS  has  two  pieces;  Nadir  and
Limb.  The  Nadir  piece  is  intended  to  go  on  NPOESS  1.  My  ques-
tion  was:  if  we  wanted  Limb  to  go  back  as  well,  and  we  would  do,
and  as  I  understand  General  Mashiko’s  answer,  we  can,  but  it  in-
creases the risk, and that is correct.

Now,  is  that  just  the  situation  with  the  first  satellite?  If  we  ask
to  put  Limb  on  the  other  satellites,  would  there  be  lower  risks  or
higher risks in doing so?

Brigadier General MASHIKO. In a pure sense the risk equation—
clearly  any  time  you  add  something  to  a  satellite,  you  have  added
risk—but  what  you  have  the  virtue  of  in  Charley  2,  3,  4,  all  the
subsequent  vehicles,  you  have  already  built  one.  You  have  already
integrated the most complex, greatest number of sensors onto your
satellite. So you know what you are adding to. So while it increases
the risk, it is a smaller increase in risk when you add it to the sub-
sequent units when you have already flight-demonstrated your first
bird.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much.
The second priority listed in the January report is the Earth Ra-
diation Budget Sensor for it measures how much of the sun’s radi-
ation  gets  absorbed  by  the  land,  by  oceans,  and  by  atmosphere.
Continuity  in  measuring  this  is  considered  so  important  that  the
report  wanted  to  take  our  last  existing  sensor  and  put  it  on  Pre-
paratory  Project,  put  it  on  the  Preparatory  Project  mission.  Then
build  ERPS  for  the  NPOESS  satellites.  Yet  according  to  a  presen-
tation at last year’s Polar Max conference, the team for this sensor
is  disbanded—‘‘CERES  team  at  NGST  would  have  to  be  reconsti-
tuted.’’ 10 The  cost  impact  of  canceling  ERBS  was  $73  million.  We
are going to need this data I think, Dr. Marburger, if we are to un-
derstand  climate  change.  NASA  and  NOAA  recommend  putting  it
on the first NPOESS satellite. What do we do?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  What  do  we  do  with  that  instrument  is  one  of
the  questions  that  we  have  asked  NASA  and  NOAA  to  give  us
more  information  on  so  that  we  can  determine  whether  it  makes
sense  to  put  it  on  one  of  the  subsequent  NPOESS  satellites  or  on
a  free-flier  of  its  own.  Because  there  are  options,  obviously,  to  get
this  data  from  space  missions  other  than  NPOESS,  and  so  the
question  is  one  of  assessing  the  impact  of  possible  schedules

stretch—of increasing the risk of NPOESS versus the benefits asso-
ciated with putting it on its own separate mission.

Those are the kinds of questions that take the experts to analyze
and  the  context  of  all  of  our  other  Earth-observing  missions  and
give us some advice, and we expect that decisions like that will be
made  in  time  to  inform  the  budget  process  so  that  the  President
can  ask  Congress  for  the  appropriate  funds  to  resolve  these  ques-
tions.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Why  can  we  fly  it  on  a  free-flier  if  we  took
it  off  NPOESS  because  it  cost  too  much?  Cost  differential?  Same,
more, less?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  We  have  already  heard  that  the  costs  of
NPOESS  has  escalated.  It  was  multiplied  by  a  factor  of  two  since
it  originally  was  planned,  and  indeed,  if  additional  cost  increases,
or  worse,  the  loss  of  capability  for  weather  prediction  for  the  mili-
tary is a consequence of putting it on, then we would certainly con-
sider alternatives at—even at significant costs.

So the cost-benefit equation here has some pretty big numbers in
it,  and  indeed  it  does  make  sense  to  consider  free-flying  missions
for some of these other Earth-observing satellites.

I  want  to  emphasize  again  the  very  large  number  of  missions
that we do fly for Earth observation. We have approximately 25 ac-
tive Earth-observing satellite missions at the present time, and the
NPOESS  sensors  represent  a  small  portion  of  our  capability  for
making  these  measurements.  So  the  future  of  our  Earth-observing
program that supports climate and ocean science, it really needs to
be considered in a much broader context than NPOESS.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  understand  that,  but  it  just  seems  to  me
that  making  some  of  these  decisions  to,  for  example,  stop  work  on
one,  cancel  it,  and  then  come  back  and  put  it,  whether  it  is  on  a
free-flier  or  back  in  the  same  place,  adds  so  much  more  money.
Why can’t we make better decisions the first time around?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Well,  I  think  we  have  heard  that  question  an-
swered  before.  These  are  big,  high-risk  projects,  and  the  manage-
ment of them is very difficult, especially when more than one agen-
cy is involved. We are talking about big numbers, and we are talk-
ing  about  major  costs  associated  with  delays  and  lack  of  access  to
critical  operational  data.  So  in  my  view  it  is  a  part  of  the  expense
of doing business in this very high-tech, high-risk game that we are
in.

Chairman LAMPSON. NPOESS has a history of taking really long
to make those decisions, and, in my opinion, not following the plan
that  was  put  together  in  the  first  place,  and  perhaps  if  that  plan
had been followed on some more of these, perhaps there may have
been some smaller amount of money spent. I will never, ever forget
the  project  that  was  canceled  at  Johnson  Space  Center  that  costs,
we  made  the  decision  to  cancel  that  particular  project,  and  it  cost
$12 million more to mothball it than it would have cost to complete
it.  And  those  are  the  kinds  of  decisions  that  I  think  we  all  ought
to  be  ashamed  of  and  make  an  attempt  to  do  a  much  better  job.
My  time  is  up,  and  I  now  recognize  Mr.  Inglis  for  five  minutes.
Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MORE ON DATA GAPS

Dr.  Marburger,  if  we  could  go  to  that  redundancy  question  I
think you were just answering from the Chairman and also earlier
from  Ms.  Biggert.  As  soon  as  redundancy  for  weather  observation
and  for  climate  change,  are  there  other  units  up  there  that  are
gathering both types of information?

Dr. MARBURGER. Well, certainly weather information and climate
information are coupled, and some instruments are dual-purpose as
it  were.  In  fact,  even  with  the  loss  of  the  sensors  in  the  restruc-
tured  NPOESS  program,  there  is  still  a  significant  climate  change
and  ocean  research-related  capability  on  NPOESS.  I  would  say
about half of the climate-related science capability has been lost in
the restructured programs.

But in addition to the NPOESS instruments, both those that are
retained and restructured programs and those that were lost, there
are  literally  dozens  of  other  instruments  that  we  have  in  space,
and  some  on  the  ground,  that  are  contributing  data  to  the  overall
climate science effort. And that is what I was referring to, that we
have  a  large  number  of  satellites.  We  have  the  GOES11 program,
which is also weather, and it gives climate, but we have a number
of other sensors on other satellite programs.

And  this  is  part  of  an  integrated  Earth-observation  system  that

the U.S. manages that a number of agencies participate in.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Sir,  there  is  a  recent  article  that  said  that,  I  quote,
‘‘Most  of  the  climate  instruments  needed  to  collect  more  precise
data  over  long  periods  of  time  are  being  eliminated.’’ 12 Your  re-
sponse to that?

Dr. MARBURGER. I would say that that is a misleading statement.
First  of  all,  it  is  misleading  if  it  is  taken  to,  applied  to  all  climate
sensors  that  the  U.S.  has  in  space.  That  is  totally  incorrect.  It  is
only  a  small  fraction  of  the  climate  science  sensors  that  we  fly  in
our total climate science program.

With respect to the climate science capabilities of specifically the
NPOESS  program,  it  is  probably  half  right,  but  I  would  say  that,
as I said in response to an earlier question, my impression is from
the briefings that I have had and from the reports that I have read
that  about  half  of  the  climate  science  capability  of  NPOESS  has
been lost in the restructuring.

Mr. INGLIS. Yeah. The Director of Climate Science Watch said in
that  same  article,  was  quoted  in  that  same  article  as  saying  that,
‘‘We  are  going  to  start  being  blinded  in  our  ability  to  observe  the
planet.’’

Dr. MARBURGER. That is a grossly misleading statement. We will
by no means be blinded in our ability to observe the planet by the
decisions that were made in the restructuring of the NPOESS pro-
gram.

Mr. INGLIS. And that is because of all the other sensors.
Dr. MARBURGER. Right.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Now,  what  if  time  goes  on,  and  we  don’t  meet  the
timelines  from  here  for  the  launch  of  these,  the  new  NPOESS  sat-
ellites.  Is  there  enough  redundancy  with  the  life  expectancy  of  the
existing satellites to continue to collect data?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  It  would  be,  it  would  represent  a  serious  prob-
lem for NOAA and the Department of Defense if the NPOESS mis-
sion were stretched out indefinitely. I mean, this is, in fact, a very
important  satellite  program.  It  provides  basic  weather  capabilities
for operational weather forecasting for the National Weather Serv-
ice and for the military. So it is important for NPOESS to survive,
and  that  is  one  of  the  reasons  that  such  drastic  decisions  were
made  to  remove  these  important  science  sensors  so  that  the  re-
maining sensors could be launched on time.

And  it  is  also  one  of  the  reasons  that  we  are  being  so  careful
about  making  decisions  to  put  things  back,  recommend  to  put
things  back  on.  You  don’t  want  to  jeopardize  those  fundamental
operational  missions.  We  need  to  have  the  ability  to  track  hurri-
canes and make weather forecasts for a variety of purposes.

So this is a program that got in trouble. It is very important. Pri-
orities  had  to  be  set,  reconfigurations  had  to  be  designed,  and  we
are  now  facing  the  questions,  the  problem  of  what  do  we  do  next.
How do we maintain as much capability as we can for these impor-
tant  missions  and  not  lose  the  essential  capabilities  that  NPOESS
was designed for.

It  doesn’t  mean  that  we  are  diminishing  the  science  or  that  we
don’t think that the science is important. Indeed, we do, and we are
committed  to  making  our  capabilities  strong  enough  to  continue  to
provide  leadership  in  science,  in  climate  science,  as  we  have  been.

IMPACT ON THE EARTH-OBSERVATION PROGRAM

Mr.  BAIRD.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  am  interested  in  the
interface  between  the  manned  missions  and  the  Earth-observatory
missions,  and  actually  the  President’s  call  for  eventually  trying  to
get  to  Mars  and  how  that  may  have  impacted  some  of  the  Earth-
observational  missions  in  a  variety  of  possible  ways,  which  I  will
put out but then ask for your comment.

You  could  imagine  it  impacts  it  budgetarily,  you  could  imagine
that  personnel  are  drawn  from  one  mission  to  another,  you  can
imagine  that  the  perceived  priority  for  advancement  status  of  peo-
ple working on one project versus another drops as some new, more
glamorous or politically sexy thing comes in. What is—any insights
into  that,  how  this  manned  effort  may  have  possibly  adversely,  or
possibly  complimentarily,  impacted  this;  not  just  NPOESS  but
other Earth-observation missions?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Well,  there  is  no  question  that  NASA  operates
in  a  pretty  tight  budget  envelope,  and  in  each  request  to  Congress
for  funding  for  NASA  the  President,  Office  of  Management  and
Budget,  my  office,  and  the  agencies  get  together,  we  try  to  figure
out  what  is  going  to  work.  And  I  must  say  that  it  would  be  easier
to  do  the  things  that  we  ask  NASA  to  do  if  Congress  did,  in  fact,

fund  the  requests  that  were  made  by,  as  a  result  of  this  planning
project.  It  doesn’t  always  happen,  and  it  didn’t  happen  this  time.
For example, it would be a lot easier for the NASA Administrator
to make these tough decisions if he had—if his budget were funded
according to the plans that were developed during the budget proc-
ess,  which  are  embedded  in  the  President’s  request  to  Congress.
Congress  did  not  fund  NASA  by  half  a  billion  dollars  within  the
targets that the President had requested.

So  things  like  that  make  it  difficult.  So  we  always  have  to  go
back and ask for impact statements and so forth to inform the next
round of budgeting. But I believe that the American people support
both  space  exploration  and  space  science.  They  are  exciting.  The
space  science  is  just  as  exciting  as  the  exploration.  We  have  got
these,  it  is  not  only  photographs,  but  we  have  got  really  remark-
able  information  about  our  universe  that  the  American  people  and
people around the world are excited about. So we are committed to
both.  This  Administration  has  mapped  out  a  space  exploration  vi-
sion  that  from  the  beginning  was  pitched  as  a  step  by  step,  not
a——

Mr.  BAIRD.  I  am  going  to  interrupt  you,  Dr.  Marburger.  I  hate

to do that because——

Dr. MARBURGER. Sorry.
Mr.  BAIRD.—I  have  a  lot  of  respect  for  you,  but  if  we  recap  the
Administration’s  mission  to  Mars,  we  will  not  really  get  to  the
question  I  asked,  and  it  would  be  delightful  to  do  the  other  more
fun, but the question I really asked was how does the very mission
you  are  talking  about  impact  the  Earth-observational  programs
that we are, that are before us today.

Mr.  Powner,  would  you  care  to  comment  on  that  or  Dr.

Marburger or General Mashiko?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Let  me  add  first  of  all,  the  NPOESS  mission
was  funded  through  the  Department  of  Defense  and  the  Depart-
ment  of  Commerce,  not  NASA.  It  certainly—NASA—some  impor-
tant  space  weather  and  Earth-observing  missions  are  funded
through NASA but——

Mr. BAIRD. Yeah. When I said NPOESS, I meant——
Dr. MARBURGER.—I believe——
Mr. BAIRD.—the broader Earth-observational plan.
Dr.  MARBURGER.  Yeah.  I  believe  that  this  is  not  primarily  a
money  problem.  I  believe  the  problem  associated  with  NPOESS,
the  program  we  are  talking  about  today,  is  not  primarily  a  money
problem. I believe it is a management problem.

Mr.  BAIRD.  Mr.  Powner  or  General  Mashiko,  any  comments  on

that?

Brigadier  General  MASHIKO.  Certainly.  To  provide  some  insight
at  a  purely  tactical  level,  NASA  has  been  very  supportive  of  the
program to the extent that while we have ten dedicated personnel,
NASA-badged  personnel  working  in  my  office  or  in  Colonel  Stock-
ton’s integrated program office, I have an additional 90 people that
are  supporting  the  program  either  full-  or  part-time  out  of  NASA
Goddard  or  out  of  Headquarters,  and  those  people  are  provided
based  on  being  the  subject-matter  experts  that  we  needed  to  work
on  either  sensors  or  specific  types  of  problems.  And  those  were

52

brought  to  bear  by  the  chief  engineer’s  office  as  well  as  the  center
director out at Goddard.

Mr.  BAIRD.  Was  there  any  borrowing?  In  other  words,  were  peo-
ple  moved  from  this  mission  or  other  related  Earth-observational
missions to focus on the manned exploration side at any point?

Brigadier  General  MASHIKO.  Sir,  these  people—the  areas  of  ex-
pertise were primarily in the types of sensors that are flying on the
polar  satellites  as  well  as  the  GOES  satellites.  So  it  is  that  type
of background that we are exploiting.

Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Powner, any comments?
Mr.  POWNER.  We  clearly  did  not  look  in  terms  of,  you  know,
where those folks came from to supplement Colonel Mashiko’s staff.
Mr.  BAIRD.  I  think  whether  or  not  the  particular  issue  on  this
particular  mission  lead  to  a  conclusion  that  the  Moon/Mars  explo-
ration  has  impacted  Earth  observation  in  this  particular  case  may
be  ambiguous.  I  don’t  think  it  is  ambiguous.  My  read  of  the  infor-
mation  is  it  is  not  ambiguous  in  a  broader  case  of  Earth  observa-
tion. Would that be a fair statement? In other words, that there is
fairly—there  is  a  fairly  clear  potential  adverse  impact  of  the  in-
creased  focus  on  the  manned  mission  to  the  Moon  and  Mars,  and
we may choose to make that decision, but making that decision has
impacts  in  a  finite  world  with  $2  billion  a  week  going  to  Iraq,  a
$9 trillion budget deficit, a $450 billion operating deficit, et cetera,
et  cetera.  Is  that  a  fair  statement  that  we  are  making  a  decision
if we pursue these manned explorations to other planets to possibly
give shorter shrift to our Earth observational?

Dr. MARBURGER. We always have to have priorities, and if there
is limited funds, then you have to make priorities in each area, and
everybody suffers. I believe that both sides of the NASA house, the
exploration  side  and  the  science  side,  are  operating  under  pretty
severe budget constraints at the present time.

Mr. BAIRD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman LAMPSON. You are welcome, Mr. Baird.
I will now recognize Ms. Biggert for five minutes.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me go back.
Dr.  Marburger,  you  suggested  that  it  was  not  a  money  problem
but  a  management  problem.  Is  that  because  of  three  agencies,  or
is there a different problem?

Dr. MARBURGER. I believe that the management issues have been
outlined  pretty  well  in  the  reports  that  you  have  available.  The
GAO has followed this for a long time, and you know, the manage-
ment of big, technically-advanced programs is always difficult. It is
hard  to  know  where  the  technology  will  be  by  the  time  you  are
ready  to  launch  or  in  the  cases  I  am  more  familiar  with,  building
particle accelerators. You really have to guess where the technology
will be when you are ready to install it. And I think there is a spe-
cial  kind  of  management  that  goes  with  technically-intensive
projects.  This  is  the  kind  of  management  that  General  Mashiko  is
an  expert  in,  and  she  referred  to  some  of  the  things  that  one  does
in managing these types of programs.

So  it  isn’t  just  a  question  of  paying  attention  and  keeping  the
books  correctly.  It  is  also  a  question  of  doing  project  management,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:15 Jul 23, 2008 Jkt 035707 PO 00000 Frm 00056 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\060707\35707 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

53

to take into account the technical risks that you know are going to
be there, and to have large contingencies and so forth that will pre-
vent surprises.

Ms. BIGGERT. Well, as you know, as this progresses, do you think
then  that  there  should  be  just  one  agency  involved?  And  if  so,
which one?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Now  we  are  getting  into  a  matter  of  opinion
here about the management. When it comes to space projects, there
are  two  parts.  One  is  the  infrastructure  associated  with  launching
and operating in space, and there is quite a substantial infrastruc-
ture  that  is  somewhat  independent  of  the  instruments.  The  other
is  the  instrumental  and  scientific  context.  So  very  frequently  you
will  have  an  agency  like  the  National  Science  Foundation  or  the
Department of Energy that has a project that needs to be launched
in  space.  They  almost  have  to  work  with  NASA  in  order  to  couple
the space expertise with the instrumental and science expertise.

So  I  believe  that  we  will  continue  to  see  projects  that  are  man-
aged—that  require  multi-agency  coordination,  and  we  just  have  to
learn  lessons  about  how  to  do  that  from  NPOESS  and  from  the
other projects, some of which have gone sour, too. We have to learn
how  to  do  that,  because  we  are  going  to  be  doing  more  and  more
of it as time goes on.

INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION

Ms. BIGGERT. How would you then characterize the international
community’s  interest  in  remote  sensoring,  and  should  we  be  look-
ing at opportunities to engage them with us and, again, this would
be costs?

Dr. MARBURGER. We certainly should be, and one of the features
of the restructured NPOESS program is to take advantage of Euro-
pean  weather  satellites  in  two  of  the  orbits  that  were  de-mani-
fested.  So  prior  to  restructuring,  there  were  six  satellites  in  three
different  orbits  associated  with  this  program.  After  restructuring,
there  were  four  satellites  in  two  orbits,  and  the  third  orbit  would
be  provided  by  the  Europeans,  so  that  we  are  already  taking  into
account  the  possibility  that  other  countries  will  have  capabilities
that we can use. And we absolutely must be building those into our
plans, those capabilities into our plans.
Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you. I yield back.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Ms. Biggert.
Mr. Diaz-Balart, five minutes.

QUIKSCAT

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  want
to talk a little bit about the QuikSCAT satellite. I was in the Hur-
ricane Center just last week for obvious reasons, and I was able to
see  firsthand—and  which  I  had  seen  before,  the  actual  passes  of
the QuikSCAT satellite that provides some information that frank-
ly, is extremely valuable to, you know, to figure out where the cen-
ters of the storms are, et cetera. And we all know that it was sup-
posed  to  have  a  five-year  lifespan.  It  is  on  its  eighth  year.  It  may
be  on  its  way  out.  We  don’t  know.  And  what  was  supposed  to  re-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:15 Jul 23, 2008 Jkt 035707 PO 00000 Frm 00057 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\060707\35707 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

54

place that was taken out of the ones that are supposed to come up
shortly, and now the replacement doesn’t go up to 2016.

Frankly, that is a little worrisome. Yes, they are looking at ways
to  tap  into  other  satellites,  European  satellites,  but  what  I  have
heard is that what that satellite provides is frankly something that
is not totally replaceable with what is out there right now.

And  the  question  is  why  2016,  if  we  know  that  we  have  a  sat-
ellite  that  is,  you  know,  on  its  eighth  year  of  what  is  supposed  to
be  a  five-year  lifespan.  And  after  knowing  that,  you  know,  we  are
in  an  elevated  cycle  of  storms  that  about  a  30-year  cycle  history
will  show  us,  and  we  know  the  cost  of  those  storms,  I  don’t  quite
understand why that is not a higher priority.

Dr. MARBURGER. Mr. Congressman, the QuikSCAT information is
clearly  important  for  tracking  hurricanes.  We  understand  the  im-
portance of that program and are watching it.

The  problems  that  have  been  publicized  associated  with
QuikSCAT  have  not  appeared  in  any  priority  documentation  that
has reached me or my office. My understanding is that the satellite
continues  to  be  very  functional,  all  of  its  instruments  are  func-
tioning,  it  has  switched  over  to  a  back-up  telemetry  system,  which
is  functioning  very  well.  I  presume  it  is  at  least  as  robust  as  the
original  telemetry  system  with  which  there  was  a  problem,  but  it
is  not,  it  has  not  been  rated  as  requiring  urgent  attention  at  this
time.  And  as  soon  as  an  agency  that  has  responsibility  for  this,
these  types  of  measurements  notifies  us  that  it  is  an  urgent  pri-
ority,  we  will  certainly  pay  attention  to  it.  But  it  simply  hasn’t
risen to that level of priority that we have seen fit to intervene on.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. If I may, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman LAMPSON. Yes.
Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  may,  I  bring  this  up  be-
cause  obviously  if  we  were  to  lose  that  satellite,  that  capability,  it
is about a 16 percent reduction in the actual forecasting, you know,
coverage.

Chairman LAMPSON. Right.
Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Or  efficiency  or  whatever  you  want  to  call  it.
Chairman LAMPSON. An important piece. Right.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Right. Right. Now, if you would be so kind, sir,
if you would have somebody look into that, because I do know, I’m
not  the  smartest  guy  in  the  world,  but  it  seems  to  me  that  if  it  is
a  five-year  lifespan,  and  you  are  on  the  eighth  year,  and  now  we
are  looking  at  until  2016,  I  don’t  know  how  many  years  you  can
milk  out  of  something  like  this.  But  I  would  like  somebody  to  get
back  to  me  and  tell  me  they  have  looked  at  that.  If,  in  fact,  there
is  absolute  confidence  that  it  is  going  to  be  there,  working  well
until  then,  and  if  not,  what  are  the  alternatives.  Because  I  just,  I
am  a  little  concerned  as  you  can  well  know,  you  can  imagine,  the
hurricane  season  comes,  and  I  represent  South  Florida  and  the
only  hurricanes  we  like  are  the  football  team  from  the  University
of Miami.

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Well,  despite  the  fact  that  this  hasn’t  come  up
in our discussions and briefings, when we heard about the concerns
we began to look at them. We will get back to you.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Great.

GENERAL MASHIKO’S DEPARTURE

Dr. Marburger, your testimony about management just a minute
ago  obviously  referred  to  also  what  General  Mashiko  said  earlier
about  it  is  hard  to  find  talented  space  people.  But  is  that  not  ex-
actly  the  reason  why  she  ought  to  be  considered  to  be  kept  as  the
director,  or  as  the  person  over  this  program,  rather  than  changing
horses at this time?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  That  is  not  my  decision  to  make.  That  is  the
Department  of  Defense’s  decision.  They  have  the  responsibility  for
managing  this  program,  and  they  are  one  of  the  principle  bene-
ficiaries of the results from NPOESS, and I believe that——

Chairman LAMPSON. Would you agree with me that is something

that they certainly ought to consider?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  I  have  the  highest  respect  for  General

Mashiko’s talents, and I wish she were working for me.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  All  right.  Mr.  Powner,  would  you  comment,
and so would you, General Mashiko, would you, I don’t want to put
you on the spot, both of you. Start with Mr. Powner.

Mr.  POWNER.  Well,  clearly  that  was  one  of  the  recommendations
in  our  report.  You  are  at  a  point  in  this  program  where  there  is
still  a  lot  of  risks  involved,  VIIRS  in  particular.  They  need  to  be
aggressively managed. She does a very good job holding contractors
accountable,  picking  up  the  phone,  talking  to  executives,  with  the
various  contractors  and  subcontractors,  getting  them  to  the  table.
We  don’t  believe  now  is  the  time  to  rotate  someone  like  General
Mashiko.  She  does  a  very  good  job,  and  an  important  part  of  this
program  is  continuity  of  executive  leadership.  That  has  been  a
problem leading up to the Nunn-McCurdy issue, and now you have
a key executive, and you are about to rotate her off. We don’t think
that is wise.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you. Now I will put you on the spot.
Brigadier General MASHIKO. Let me address it a couple ways, sir.
The  upcoming  period—because  we  are  going  to  have  the  program
restructured  and  in  place  in  the  beginning  of  July,  is  going  to  be
primarily  execution.  Now  that  there  is  a—there  will  be  a  contract
in  place,  so  it  is  going  to  be  primarily  execution;  where  you  are
going  to  need  the  critical  continuity  is,  in  fact,  at  the  program  di-
rector level. The way you separate the area of responsibility, if you
will, the program director is the one that truly makes the contactor
execute  on  a  day-to-day  fashion.  The  program  executive  deals  up
and  out,  and  with  respect  to  my  job,  which  is  up  and  out,  clearly
sitting  here  and  dealing  with  various  other  agencies,  the  Depart-
ment of Commerce has the responsibility to replace me. They have
been using the standard OPM process in order to do that. They got
a  reasonable  number  of  candidates.  They  were  screened.  The  can-
didates  have,  in  fact,  been  interviewed,  and  as  soon  as  we  get  the
EXCOM, all three members on the telephone to do the actual ratifi-
cation  of  the  selection,  the  name  will  go  forward  to  OPM  for  ap-
proval.

And I have been informed that we do have a viable candidate for
my  replacement,  and  so  once  that  happens  we  will  be  more  than
happy  to  let  the  Committee  know  who  that  is,  in  fact,  going  to  be.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much.

PROGRAM STATUS

Is the NPOESS program as currently constituted on track to de-
liver four satellites in orbit to operate between the years 2013 and
2036—2026, excuse me—for an acquisition cost of $11.5 billion, and
an additional $1 billion in operating costs?

Brigadier General MASHIKO. Sir, until the contract is negotiated,
all I can tell you is that is what the plans are. At the present time
we believe that the program will, in fact, meet the total acquisition
cost  of  $11.5  billion  with  the  additional  billion  dollars  for  oper-
ations and support.

To  give  you  additional  confidence  and  to  give  myself  additional
confidence, I asked the OSD13 cost group who did the original inde-
pendent  cost  estimate  that  the  Nunn-McCurdy  was  based  on,  I
asked  them  to  do  an  independent  cost  estimate  as  to  what  oper-
ations and support will be in the future, and the allocation of those
dollars  and  which  year  should  they  be  so  that  we  can  do  the  nec-
essary flow of money to get everything correctly lined up.

So  that  is  in  work.  That,  in  parallel  with  the  negotiation  of  the
actual modification, will solidify what the final cost of the program
should  be,  and  then  we  can  then  make  any  adjustments  to  the
budget. But any adjustments to the budget will be in the out years,
not the years of execution.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Okay.  You  believe  right  now  it  is  on  track?
Brigadier General MASHIKO. Yes, sir.
Chairman LAMPSON. I hesitate to ask this. My time is——
Mr.  POWNER.  Mr.  Chairman,  can  I  just  add  something  to  that?
Chairman LAMPSON. Please.
Mr.  POWNER.  You  know,  that  is  fine  that  we  are  making  that
statement,  but  I  just  want  to  be  clear  that  GAO’s  opinion  on  this,
there  are  still  a  lot  of  risks,  and  until  that  contract’s  inked,  you
know,  I  think  we  need  to  remain  very  cautious  with  that  estimate
until that contract is solidified. And that is to be next month.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you.  I  know  my  time  is  up.  Bear
with  me  for  just  a  second,  please,  because  this  is  a  short  question,
and maybe rhetorical.

The report from NASA and NOAA did not include financial data
that was necessary—that deal with a lot of this. Along the way has
anyone  been  fired  or  censored  because  of  actions  that  they  have
taken, or has any contract been terminated? Anybody, please.

Brigadier General MASHIKO. Sir, let me ask you what timeframe

do you mean, and then I will——

Chairman LAMPSON. At any time.
Brigadier  General  MASHIKO.  Okay.  Let  me  back  all  the  way  up
to  August  of  2005.  At  that  point  the  system  program  director  re-
signed.  That  was  the  government  system  program  director.  At  the
contractor,  the  contractor  program  director  was  removed.  Most  of
his management staff was, in fact, changed at the contractor at the

13 OSD: Office of the Secretary of Defense.

Northrop  Grumman  level.  If  you  go  to  Raytheon,  Santa  Barbara,
which  was  responsible  for  the  VIIRS  contract,  we  have  done,  over
time,  almost  two  full  management  shifts  and  change-outs  in  order
to  find  the  right  management  team  to  actually  execute  the  pro-
gram.  As  a  result  we  have  a  vice-president  out  at  Raytheon  lit-
erally  running  the  VIIRS  program.  He  is  a  Navy  nuke  guy,  so  he
comes  from  a  zero-defect  kind  of  background,  and  that  is  the  type
of  management  rigor  that  has  been  put  in  place  out  at  Santa  Bar-
bara.  The  management  team  at  Northrop  Grumman—what  we
have  done  there,  in  addition  to  doing  the  change  of  the  program
manager—originally  that  program  manager  was  a  direct  report  to
the  sector  president,  totally  bypassing  the  functionals,  if  you  will,
within  the  Northrop  Grumman  campus.  We  have  changed  that
such  that  NPOESS  is  not  treated  as  a  normal  program,  and  the
functional vice presidents at Northrop Grumman are now fully en-
gaged  in  the  program,  bringing  that  level  of  expertise  and  experi-
ence to the program as well.

MORE ON GENERAL MASHIKO’S DEPARTURE

Mr.  INGLIS.  General  Mashiko,  based  on  your  departure  coming
up  in  a  month,  I  think  it  is,  is  there  going  to  be  enough  time  for
you to bring the replacement up to speed, or is that a concern that
you have?

Brigadier  General  MASHIKO.  Sir,  in  all  honesty  it  is  going  to  de-
pend  on  who  the  individual  actually  selected  is.  And  we  will  make
the  necessary  adjustments.  The  Air  Force  is  prepared  to  allow  me
to split my time in order to do a correct transition if it is somebody
who is being brought in from the outside.

Mr. INGLIS. Right. Because it does sound like, particularly based
on  your  last  entry,  the  last  question,  that  there  is  an  awful  lot  of
information  that  you  will  be  taking  with  you  that  needs  to  be  im-
parted  to  your  replacement.  So  I  hope  there  is  some  flexibility  on
how it is that you will be able to bring them up to speed.

Brigadier  General  MASHIKO.  Yes,  sir.  There  is  a  great  deal  of
flexibility with my new boss, and the other thing is, is the new job
that  I  am  going  to  I  will  be  spending  considerable  time  in  the
Washington,  D.C.  area,  so  that  will  also  facilitate  any  additional
overlap that is required after my departure.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Nice  to  be  so  indispensable,  isn’t  it?  That  is  a  good

Brigadier General MASHIKO. Yes, sir. Job security is a wonderful

thing, you know.

thing.

Mr. INGLIS. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman LAMPSON. Mr. Baird. Five minutes.

TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Mr.  BAIRD.  The  gentleman  from  Florida  raised  an  interesting
issue  that  highlights  a  broader  question  which  has  to  do  with  the
research  operations  process.  So  you  set  up,  buy  something  for  re-
search  purposes,  you  come  back  with  some  interesting  data.  How
then do you translate that instrumentation or the analogs that de-
velop  out  of  that  or  whatever  data  you  get  into  actual  usage,  sus-
tainable information feedback? And this research to operations gap.
Could anybody comment on that and what is being done to address
that? So we don’t just go out, find something interesting, and then
not actually apply it down the road. And sometimes you find some-
thing that is not applicable, but if you find something useful, what
are we doing to follow up on that?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  On  the  science  side  most  of  the  data  analyses
that  lead  to  discoveries  are  published  in  the  open  literature,  and
that  is  the  medium  of  communication  at  the  basic  level  that  the
science  community  relies  on  to  get  these  ideas  out  and  have  them
discussed  in  conferences.  And  there  are  usually  teams  of  people
sometimes  from  multiple  federal  laboratories  and  universities  that
manage these so that they appear at conferences.

Mr. BAIRD. I have read many of the special issues of Science from

these very things.

Dr. MARBURGER. You know how that works.
Mr.  BAIRD.  I  am  a  long  member  of  AAAS15 and  subscribed——
Dr.  MARBURGER.  So  the  next  steps  are  usually  rather  com-
plicated  and  not  terribly  well  defined.  Most  institutions,  both  fed-
eral  labs  and  universities  have  technology  transfer  offices  that  are
alert  for  ideas  that  their  scientists  have  that  might  be  turned  into
commercially-significant  applications,  and  they  work  with  the  fac-
ulty  and  or  with  the  scientists  who  protect  the  intellectual  prop-
erty.

Mr.  BAIRD.  Now,  what  about  NASA  and  NOAA,  that  interface?
You  know,  you  send  up  a  research  flight,  find  something  inter-
esting. Do you then incorporate that in terms of a long-term obser-
vational system or something stable that becomes part of your reg-
ular routine?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  When  it  comes  to  the  instrumentation,  abso-
lutely. The discoveries that are made, for example, by a contractor
developing  an  advanced  sensor  are  typically  made  available  to
other  projects.  And  I  would  say  that  some  of  the  technology  that
we find on our cell phones and our digital cameras came from early
work  and  early  experience  with  NASA  imaging  requirements.  And
particularly from military imagining requirements. So we have——
Mr.  BAIRD.  I  appreciate,  I  know  there  are  spin  offs  in  the  gen-
eral.  I  am  told  that  this  is  a  recurring  problem  or  perceives  to  be
a  recurring  problem,  that  we  sort  of  do  one  slight  thing  but  they
don’t  necessarily  translate  into  long  term  in  the  NASA–NOAA
interface.

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Well,  I  don’t  think  the  NASA–NOAA  interface
is  unique.  I  believe  that  this  problem  exists  with  almost  every  sci-
entific application, but the, you know, what makes the communica-
tions  work  is  that  the  scientists  and  the  engineers  talk  to  each

other  about  whether  there  are  stovepipes  in  agencies  or  not.  The
good ideas do tend to get translated.

So  my  view  is  it  is  a  complex  press.  There  may  be  cases  where
interagency communications aren’t ideal, but in this scientific com-
munity and the technical community, there is a great deal of inter-
change of ideas.

I would be glad to respond to it to more specific or detailed ques-
tions  about  this  because  it  is  an  important  issue  that  my  office
watches.  And  we  specifically  are  charged  by  Congress  to  do  inter-
agency  coordination  and  sometimes  it  is  not  easy.  So  if  problems
arise that you are aware of that you would like to have more feed-
back on or just——

Mr.  BAIRD.  I  guess  one  example  I  could  imagine,  you  know,  you
build  these  things  and  so  it  is  an  interactive  process.  So  you  send
up  a  flight,  gather  some  data.  For  sure  then  somebody  else  wants
to send their flight up, and they want to gather their data.

Dr. MARBURGER. Right.
Mr.  BAIRD.  But  the  question  for  me  is  to  what  extent  do  you—
is  there  a  prioritization  that  says,  ‘‘Okay,  we  sent  this  up.  We
learned  this  from  this.’’  Now,  maybe  our  next  test  flight  is  not—
whoever  happens  to  be  next  in  the  queue  of  putting  something
from  the  first  one  we  learned  permanently  because,  lo  and  behold,
it was actually useful instead of having—okay. Shelve that. Publish
your  special  issue  of  Science  magazine.  We  all  read  it,  and—or
most  people  don’t,  but  then  we  go  to  the  next,  publish  a  special
issue  of  Science,  and  somewhere  along  the  line  that  cumulative
benefit gets lost.

Dr.  MARBURGER.  In  general  that  kind  of  intelligence  that  is
brought to the sequence of scientific explorations is provided by the
scientific  community  through  the  National  Academies  of  Science,
and  the  decadal  surveys  and  the  special  reports  that  are  commis-
sioned  both  by  NOAA  and  by  NASA  are  taken  very  seriously  by
those  agencies  as  they  plan  their  projects  and  programs.  And  we
watch  that  process  at  OSTP.  We  force  the  agencies  to  come  to-
gether and make strategic plans together that provide guidance for
all the agencies that might participate in these. And we frequently
ask the agencies to go to the National Academy or to their own ex-
ternal advisory panels of scientists to get advice on what to do next
and how to take advantage of that data that already exists.

Mr. BAIRD. Anyone else care to comment on that?
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Baird.

MORE ON DATA GAP CONCERNS

General Mashiko, GAO states that the cost analysts are about 90
percent confident that there will be—that they are 90 percent con-
fident  that  there  will  be  no  weather  coverage  gap.  What  is  the
basis for that confidence?

Brigadier  General  MASHIKO.  Sir,  when  we  went  through  the
Nunn-McCurdy  process,  that  was  the  driving  priority,  and  it  was
the  operational  data  continuity.  What  we  did  was  in  order  to  as-
sure approximately a 90 percent operational data continuity, which
the  GAO  refers  to,  we  had  to  pull  risks  out  of  the  first  NPOESS
bird  in  order  to  increase  the  likelihood  of  it  being  able  to  be

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:15 Jul 23, 2008 Jkt 035707 PO 00000 Frm 00063 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\060707\35707 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

launched  on  the  date  specified,  which  is  why  the  CMIS16 sensor
was canceled and taken off of the first Charley bird and put on the
second Charley bird. Because that was going to be the critical path
for  that,  the  first  operational  NPOESS,  and  we  needed  to  get  the
risk equation down such that we increased the likelihood that that
satellite  would,  in  fact,  be  able  to  be  delivered  and  launched  when
it  was  going  to  be  needed  in  the  afternoon  orbit.  Because  if  you
take  a  look  at  the  heritage  satellites,  which  are  DMSP17 in  the
early  morning  and  mid-morning  in  orbit  and  then  POES18 in  the
afternoon  orbit,  they  actually  run  out  of  POES  in  the  afternoon
orbit,  and  there  would  be  an  operational  data  gap  such  that  we
wouldn’t  be  able  to  do  standard  weather  forecasting  that  we  have
all gotten used to on the Weather Channel, unless we were able to
get the NPOESS bird up there in the timeframe.

And that is what is generally referred to as the 90 percent sched-

ule.

Chairman LAMPSON. Mr. Powner, could you comment also?
Mr.  POWNER.  Well,  I  think  what  this,  what  came  out  of  Nunn-
McCurdy  really  highlights  the  importance  of  staying  on  schedule
now.  I  mean,  we  have  pushed  a  lot  of  these  birds,  extending  their
useful  lives.  I  mean,  fortunately,  we  have  been  able  to  push  off
some of the launches of POES and DMSP, but it is important from
this point forward that we really do stick to the schedule going for-
ward so that we may maintain that continuity.

And  I  think  the  General  brings  up  a  very  important  balancing
act  here  in  terms  of,  you  know,  what  we  add  to  C1  and  when  we
lock that down to keep it simple so that we can hit that date.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Okay.  The  GAO  also  paraphrases  the  cost
analyst  as  saying  that  they  are  highly  confident  acquisition  costs
will  not  exceed  $11.5  billion,  but  a  lower  level  of  confidence  that
the sensor configuration will remain unchanged. The lower level of
configuration and the sensor configuration suggests to me that the
program  is  prepared  to  accept  further  changes  that  will  decrease
the  observational  capabilities  of  this  satellite  system  to  maintain
this budget. Is that the case, first, General Mashiko? And then Mr.
Powner, would you comment?

Brigadier General MASHIKO. Sir, I believe what the cost analysts
are  referring  to—to  put  it  very  simply,  normally  I  always  have  a
program  schedule  where  I  have  a  triangle  on  it  that  I  don’t  gen-
erally  publish,  and  that  is  the  day  I  shoot  the  engineers,  because
literally  you  need  to  stop  doing  the  changes,  you  button  up  what
you have got, and you go with it. Because you are better off getting
what  you  have  on  orbit  and  getting  the  utility  of  out  it  and  then
making step wise changes or improvements on the next serial num-
ber.

And that is I believe what the cost analysts were referring to. It
is  not  a  matter  of  taking  sensors  off.  It  is  being  able  to  make  the
decision  of  go  with  what  you  have  got,  get  it  on  orbit,  and  get  the
end-to-end  data  chain  up  and  operational.  And  then  make  step-
wise improvements if necessary to subsequent serial numbers.

Mr.  POWNER.  That  is  a  fine  approach  to  mitigate  risks.  I  think
the  key  question,  though,  going  forward,  and  one  example  is  NPP
with the preparatory satellites that is currently in place. You know,
it  will  fly.  The  game  plan  now  is  to  fly  it  on  schedule,  but  it  is
going  to  fly  in  a  degraded  mode  where  there  are  certain  environ-
mental data records that will not be available.

In particular, the way we measure ocean color and aerosol meas-
urement, and what does that mean to users so we can button down
and  hit  schedule  and  that  type  of  thing,  but  there  is  an  impact  on
users, and that needs to be clearly articulated.

Chairman LAMPSON. Well, thank you. Thank all of you very, very
much. We appreciate your being here and for your testimony before
the Committee today and at other times.
