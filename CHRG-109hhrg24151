HEARING CHARTER

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Status of NASA’s Programs

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 2005

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On  Thursday,  November  3,  2005  at  10:00  a.m.,  the  Committee  on  Science  will
hold  a  hearing  to  review  the  status  of  plans  and  programs  of  the  National  Aero-
nautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA).  NASA  Administrator  Michael  Griffin
will  provide  a  comprehensive  update  on  all  facets  of  NASA’s  plans  and  programs.
When  Administrator  Griffin  last  testified  before  the  Committee  four  months  ago,

on June 28th, he described several reviews he had recently initiated, including:

for returning to the Moon;

• the  Exploration  Systems  Architecture  Study  (ESAS)  to  define  NASA’s  plans
• the  Shuttle/Station  Configuration  Options  Team  (S/SCOT)  to  examine  the
range  of  options  for  completing  the  Space  Station  and  retiring  the  Space
Shuttle by 2010;
• a  review  of  the  goals  and  plans  for  Project  Prometheus,  NASA’s  nuclear
• plans  for  managing  the  recent  $1  billion  cost  overrun  on  the  James  Webb

power and propulsion program; and

Space Telescope.

Since  that  hearing,  NASA  has  made  significant  progress  in  completing  these  ac-
tivities. NASA has completed and released the results of the ESAS study, it has re-
leased preliminary results of the S/SCOT study, it has decided to significantly scale
back  Prometheus  to  a  technology  research  program,  and  it  has  decided  to  slip  the
schedule  for  launch  of  the  Webb  telescope  by  two  years.  As  a  result  of  these  deci-
sions, NASA has begun reprogramming fiscal year 2005 funds and modifying its re-
quest for fiscal year 2006 appropriations.

The  hearing  is  also  timely  as  the  House  and  Senate  are  beginning  to  negotiate
a  conference  version  of  the  NASA  authorization  bill,  and  a  conference  report  on
NASA appropriations for fiscal year 2006 is expected to be completed shortly.
Overarching Questions

The  Committee  plans  to  explore  the  following  overarching  questions  at  the  hear-

ing:

1. How  can  NASA  afford  to  maintain  a  balanced  portfolio  of  science  and  aero-
nautics programs, while also completing the International Space Station and
accelerating  the  human  exploration  programs,  especially  given  the  Agency’s
projected funding shortfalls?

2. What  is  the  status  of  NASA’s  plans  to  define  the  final  configuration  of  and
research  agenda  for  the  International  Space  Station?  What  is  the  status  of
NASA’s  plans  for  returning  the  Space  Shuttle  to  flight  and  for  retiring  it  at
the end of the decade?

3. What is the guiding philosophy NASA intends to use in developing new pri-

orities for its aeronautics research program?

4. How  does  NASA  intend  to  ensure  the  Agency  has  the  appropriate  size  and
skill  mix  in  its  workforce,  as  well  as  the  facilities  and  infrastructure  nec-
essary to support the Agency’s goals?

Key Issues (all discussed in greater detail in later sections of this charter)
Budget Dilemma. NASA’s current plan is to fly 19 Space Shuttle missions between
now  and  the  end  of  2010  (18  to  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS)  and  one  to
service  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope).  NASA  has  acknowledged  that  it  is  highly  un-
likely that it can accomplish the planned missions within the Shuttle’s currently de-
fined five-year budget, which is expected to decline by $4.8 billion over the next five

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:19 May 22, 2006 Jkt 024151 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\110305\24151 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

4

years.  Some  estimates  show  the  Shuttle  may  need  nearly  $6  billion  more  than  cur-
rently  budgeted  to  accomplish  these  flights.  NASA’s  options  for  handling  the  ex-
pected shortfall appear to be limited. If NASA does not receive a significant increase
in its projected budgets over the next five years, it will either have to drop its plans
to  accelerate  the  development  of  a  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  (CEV)  or  it  will  have
to  significantly  cut  science  and/or  aeronautics.  NASA  has  already  proposed  signifi-
cant  cuts  in  some  areas  of  its  exploration  budget  and  in  Space  Station  research  to
accelerate development of the CEV.
Exploration Architecture Released and Accelerated. NASA has completed the
Exploration  Systems  Architecture  Study  (ESAS).  In  the  ESAS,  NASA  proposes  to
deliver the CEV in 2012, two years earlier than the date originally proposed by the
President.  If  it  succeeds,  Americans  would  return  to  the  Moon  by  2018.  NASA  will
develop two new launch vehicles to be derived from Shuttle elements, one to launch
the CEV and one to launch heavier loads. To accelerate the development of the CEV
and  its  launch  vehicle,  NASA  has  begun  reprogramming  funds  from  within  the
Agency’s Exploration account. NASA has also increased its fiscal year 2006 request
for  the  CEV  and  its  launch  vehicle  by  $785  million  to  $1.9  billion,  a  70  percent  in-
crease. NASA estimates it will cost approximately $104 billion to send humans back
to the Moon by 2019.
Space  Shuttle  Challenges  Remain.  The  past  three  months  have  been  a  period
of  intense  activity  for  the  Space  Shuttle  program.  The  Stafford-Covey  Return-to-
Flight Task Group completed its work and issued its final report. The Space Shuttle
completed  its  first  ‘‘return-to-flight’’  mission  but  was  subsequently  grounded  due  to
concerns  from  new  foam  debris.  And,  key  Shuttle  facilities  were  damaged  in  recent
hurricanes, which along with investigations of the foam problem will delay the next
Shuttle flight until at least May 2006.

The  Stafford-Covey  Task  Group,  which  former  Administrator  Sean  O’Keefe  char-
tered  to  assess  NASA’s  implementation  of  the  Columbia  Accident  Investigation
Board’s (CAIB) 15 ‘‘Return-to-Flight’’ recommendations, issued its final report in Au-
gust.  The  Task  Group  found  that  NASA  had  not  met  the  CAIB’s  recommendations
for  (1)  eliminating  critical  debris  shedding  from  the  External  Tank;  (2)  hardening
of  the  Shuttle  orbiter  against  debris  damage;  and  (3)  developing  the  ability  to  in-
spect and repair the Shuttle in the event that it sustained critical damage. A minor-
ity opinion in the report further argued that NASA has not yet learned the lessons
of the past, that NASA’s cultural, management, and organizational problems persist
throughout the human space flight program, and that NASA’s leadership and man-
agement  shortfalls  generally  made  the  return-to-flight  effort  more  costly  and
lengthier  than  it  needed  to  be.  Since  the  time  covered  by  the  report,  however,  Ad-
ministrator Griffin has installed new managers in top-level positions throughout the
Agency, including within the human space flight program.

On  July  26,  NASA  launched  the  Space  Shuttle  Discovery  on  the  first  mission
since the demise of the Columbia Shuttle in February 2003. However, a few minutes
after  launch  several  chunks  of  foam  fell  off  the  External  Tank.  While  the  foam  did
not  cause  any  damage  to  the  Shuttle,  it  raised  serious  concerns  over  whether  the
problems  that  led  to  the  Columbia  accident  had  indeed  been  fixed.  NASA  then
grounded  the  Shuttle  fleet  and  established  teams  to  review  the  potential  causes  of
foam  loss.  The  results  indicate  that  the  area  where  the  largest  piece  of  foam  was
lost had been damaged during ground processing of the tank. NASA believes it has
traced  the  cause  of  other  sources  of  foam  debris,  as  well.  While  a  final  decision  on
how to address the foam problems has not yet been reached, NASA says it believes
that  tighter  controls  on  processing  and  inspection,  and  a  few  specific  and  small  de-
sign changes can prevent a repeat of the foam problem.

More recently, Hurricane Katrina caused significant damage to key Space Shuttle
facilities,  particularly  the  facility  outside  of  New  Orleans  that  manufactures  the
Shuttle’s  External  Tank.  Damage  sustained  from  Katrina  will  cost  the  Agency  an
estimated  $760  million.  The  Administration’s  latest  Supplemental  Appropriations
request includes $325 million to cover part of the cost.
International Space Station (ISS) Configuration and Research Plan Cut. To
determine what options the U.S. has in completing the ISS and meeting U.S. inter-
national commitments if it plans to retire the Shuttle in 2010, Administrator Griffin
chartered  the  Shuttle/Station  Configuration  Options  Team  (S/SCOT).  As  a  result,
NASA  now  plans  18  more  Shuttle  flights  to  complete  construction  of  the  ISS  in  a
way  that  will  allow  a  six-person  crew  to  work  on-board.  NASA  will  continue  to  use
Russian vehicles, as necessary, to ferry crew and cargo to the ISS, and has promised
to take steps to engage private companies for that task. NASA has announced that
it  will  not  launch  one  piece  of  equipment  that  had  once  been  viewed  as  central  to

ISS  research—the  centrifuge  (technically  the  Centrifuge  Accommodation  Module
(CAM),  which  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  has  said  is  important  to  under-
standing  the  impact  of  long  duration  space  flight  on  the  body.  Also,  NASA  has  cut
Space  Station-  related  research  funding  by  nearly  half,  from  the  original  budgeted
level  for  fiscal  year  2005  of  about  $1  billion  to  $533  million  under  the  most  recent
proposal for fiscal year 2006.
Aeronautics Plans Revamped. Administrator Griffin has appointed Dr. Lisa Por-
ter,  a  former  official  at  the  Defense  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency  (DARPA)
as  the  new  Associate  Administrator  for  Aeronautics.  Since  her  arrival,  Dr.  Porter
has  begun  significantly  revamping  the  aeronautics  program.  Her  basic  thrust  has
been to move away from technology demonstration projects to more fundamental re-
search, and she has eliminated much of the research on security issues. The NASA
authorization  bill  that  the  House  passed  in  July  directs  the  Administration  to  de-
velop a National Aeronautics Policy to guide NASA’s aeronautics research program.
Background
Results of the Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS)

The Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) outlines NASA’s approach to
implementing  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  which  was  announced  by  President
Bush  in  January  2004.  The  Vision  calls  for  NASA  to  return  the  Space  Shuttle  to
flight,  complete  the  International  Space  Station,  return  humans  to  the  Moon,  and
prepare to send humans to Mars and beyond.

To  send  humans  back  to  the  Moon,  NASA  plans  to  develop  a  Crew  Exploration
Vehicle  (CEV)  and  a  CEV  launch  vehicle  (CLV),  the  latter  of  which  will  be  based
on  the  solid  rocket  boosters  used  by  the  Space  Shuttle.  To  carry  cargo  and  other
equipment necessary to go to the Moon, NASA plans to develop a second launch ve-
hicle  capable  of  carrying  more  mass  than  the  Saturn  V  rocket  used  in  the  Apollo
program.  That  heavy-lift  launch  vehicle  will  use  both  the  solid  rocket  boosters  and
a modified version of the external fuel tank used by the Shuttle. In this way, NASA
hopes to take advantage of skilled labor and technical know-how it has already mas-
tered  in  developing  its  new  capability  to  carry  crew  and  cargo  into  Earth’s  orbit  as
the  first  stage  of  a  lunar  mission.  NASA  examined  and  rejected  alternative  launch
approaches  such  as  using  modified  versions  of  the  rockets  that  were  developed  to
launch military satellites.

To  carry  humans  from  Earth’s  orbit  to  the  surface  of  the  Moon,  NASA  plans  to
develop  new  equipment,  including  a  lunar  command  module,  a  lunar  lander,  and  a
vehicle  to  return  the  crew  from  the  surface  of  the  Moon  to  the  command  module.
The CEV will be designed to carry six crew, and the lunar equipment to carry four
crew.  As  these  numbers  are  double  the  size  of  Apollo  crews,  Griffin  has  described
the project as ‘‘Apollo on steroids.’’

In  the  ESAS,  NASA  proposes  to  accelerated  the  CEV  by  two  years  to  2012  from
2014, the date originally announced by the President last year. Griffin wants to ac-
celerate  the  development  of  the  CEV  to  minimize  any  gap  in  the  U.S.  ability  to
launch  humans  to  space  after  NASA  retires  the  Shuttle  (which  NASA  must  do  to
afford  the  new  Vision  and  to  reduce  the  exposure  of  astronauts  to  the  risk  of  an-
other Shuttle accident) in 2010. NASA intends to begin procurement of the CEV and
the  CLV  later  this  year  and  anticipates  awarding  contracts  in  May  and  June  of
2006, respectively. The heavy launch vehicle will be developed somewhat later.

The  ESAS  provides  for  a  CEV  capable  of  serving  the  International  Space  Station
(ISS) as well as allowing human missions to the Moon for week-long stays as early
as 2018. NASA hopes to embark on longer-duration stays on the Moon by 2022.

The  ESAS  changes  the  Prometheus  Nuclear  Systems  and  Technology  program
from  a  large  development  program  to  a  relatively  small  research  effort.  The  ESAS
effectively  postpones  indefinitely  the  development  of  any  major  new  nuclear  capa-
bilities  while  maintaining  high-priority  nuclear  research  efforts.  The  program  will
decline  from  roughly  $430  million  in  fiscal  year  2005  to  $100  million  in  fiscal  year
2006, of which $90 million is required for termination costs. NASA has said it needs
to  cut  back  any  program  that  is  not  needed  in  the  near-term  to  free  up  funds  to
accelerate CEV development.

NASA’s estimate for the cost to implement the ESAS through 2011 is $31.3 billion
with  a  65  percent  confidence  level  (meaning  there  is  a  65  percent  chance  the  cost
will  be  no  more  than  $31.3  billion).  NASA  is  able  to  state  the  cost  with  that  con-
fidence  level  because  most  of  its  work  in  the  next  five  years  is  dedicated  to  devel-
oping  elements  of  the  ESAS,  such  as  the  CLV  and  heavy-lift  launch  vehicle,  based
on  existing  technology.  Costs  for  the  remainder  of  the  program  are  not  as  precise.
NASA  estimates  the  cost  of  returning  humans  to  the  Moon  by  2018  to  be  roughly

$104 billion, but it has not developed an estimate of the confidence level of that esti-
mate.
Status of Shuttle/Station Configuration Options Team (S/SCOT) Study

Griffin  chartered  a  Shuttle/Station  Configuration  Options  Team  (S/SCOT)  to  de-
termine  what  options  the  U.S.  has  for  completing  the  ISS,  given  the  plan  to  retire
the Shuttle in 2010. Griffin has approved a plan for discussion with the U.S.’s inter-
national partners in the Station.

NASA  has  released  a  brief  overview  of  some  the  study’s  main  conclusions:  NASA
proposes to fly the Shuttle a total of 19 more times—18 flights to the ISS beginning
no  earlier  than  May  2006,  and  a  possible  additional  flight  to  service  the  Hubble
Space  Telescope,  pending  a  decision  that  such  a  flight  can  be  made  safely,  which
NASA has said it would consider after the successful completion of the first Shuttle
flight next year. (Last February, NASA testified that expected that 28 more Shuttle
flights would be made to the ISS.)

The S/SCOT plan would allow the launch of key ISS elements, enabling a six-per-
son  crew  to  work  on  board.  But  under  the  plan,  NASA  will  cancel  plans  to  launch
the  Japanese-built  Centrifuge  Accommodation  Module  (CAM)  that  was  designed  to
study  the  effects  of  low-gravity  on  small  mammals.  (The  ISS  itself  allows  NASA  to
monitor  the  effects  of  zero  gravity,  but  not  the  effects  of  low  gravity,  such  as  the
levels  experienced  on  the  Moon  and  Mars.)  The  National  Academy  of  Sciences  has
said in the past that the absence of a centrifuge could hinder NASA’s ability to gain
the  knowledge  essential  to  maintain  astronaut’s  health,  safety,  and  well  being  on
long-duration space expeditions.

The  research  program  for  ISS  has  undergone  significant  changes  since  the  an-
nouncement of the President’s Vision for Space Exploration. The budget for Human
Systems  Research  and  Technology  (HSR&T),  the  bulk  of  which  is  ISS  research,  is
proposed  to  decline  by  nearly  half  from  slightly  more  than  $1  billion  in  fiscal  year
2005 to $533 million for fiscal year 2006. (NASA’s proposed fiscal year 2006 budget
was originally $806 million, but it has subsequently revised the request, reallocating
the  funding  so  as  to  accelerate  the  development  of  the  CEV  and  CLV—see  below.)
The  cuts  entail  eliminating  most  research  that  does  not  relate  to  studying  the  im-
pact  of  zero  gravity  on  humans,  for  example  research  in  the  physical  sciences.  The
proposed cuts will necessitate the termination of 322 grants.
Proposed Budget Amendments for Fiscal Year 2006

To implement the changes in the ESAS and S/SCOT, NASA has revised its fiscal
year  2006  budget  request  twice  since  submitting  the  original  request  in  February.
In  both  cases  the  primary  purpose  was  to  provide  additional  funding  to  accelerate
the  CEV  and  CLV,  and  in  both  cases  these  funds  were  reallocated  from  within  the
Exploration Systems account.

The President submitted the first revision to NASA’s budget as an official Budget
Amendment  that  added  $292  million  to  CEV  and  CLV  development  effort  for  fiscal
year  2006.  To  pay  for  this  increase,  NASA  proposed  cutting  $122  million  from  its
Exploration  Systems  Research  and  Technology  Accounts  (advanced  technologies  for
human  and  robotic  missions  to  the  Moon),  $140  million  from  Prometheus  (NASA’s
nuclear  power  and  propulsion  systems  program),  and  $30  million  from  the  Human
Systems  Research  and  Technology  account  (the  bulk  of  which  includes  the  funding
for Space Station research).

The  Budget  Amendment  also  proposed  to  cut  funding  for  future  robotic  missions
to  Mars  to  pay  for  near-term  robotic  Mars  exploration  programs,  such  as  the  Mars
Science  Laboratory  and  extension  of  the  robotic  rovers  currently  on  Mars.  The
amendment  would  also  provide  $30  million  to  preserve  the  option  of  servicing  the
Hubble  Space  Telescope  and  would  fully  fund  the  Glory  mission,  an  Earth  Science
mission that NASA has earlier tried to cut despite objections from several Members
of Congress.

In  late  September,  NASA  submitted  a  second  request  effectively  changing  its  fis-
cal  year  2006  budget  request  as  part  of  a  fiscal  year  2005  Operating  Plan  update,
proposing  to  add  an  additional  $493  million  for  CEV  and  CLV  development  efforts
in fiscal year 2006. The plan would offset this increase by further cuts in the Explo-
ration  account.  Specifically,  it  would  cut  Exploration  Systems  Research  and  Tech-
nology by an additional $174 million, Prometheus by an additional $76 million, and
Human Systems Research and Technology by an additional $243 million.

While the original request for CEV and CLV development efforts was $1.1 billion,
the two revisions to the budget request raise that amount by a total of $785 million
to $1.9 billion (a 70 percent increase).

Projected Space Shuttle Budget Shortfall

While NASA is increasingly committing funds within the its exploration program
to  high-priority  efforts  to  develop  a  CEV  and  CLV  two  years  ahead  of  its  original
plan,  the  Agency  is  facing  funding  shortfalls  in  its  Shuttle  program.  NASA’s  fiscal
year 2006–2010 budget assumes that funding for the Space Shuttle program will de-
cline  by  a  total  of  approximately  $4.8  billion  over  the  next  five  years  (see  figure
below) because of savings the Agency had said two years ago that it expected to re-
alize as the Shuttle approached its retirement date of 2010.

However,  given  the  high  fixed  costs  associated  with  the  Shuttle  program,  NASA
acknowledges  that  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  these  cost  savings  will  materialize.  In-
deed,  Griffin  has  said  that  even  canceling  the  Shuttle  and  ISS  station  programs
today  would  save  little  because  of  termination  costs,  international  obligations  and
the need to keep Shuttle staff together because of the Shuttle elements that are part
of the CEV and CLV design.

NASA  is  studying  options  to  reduce  Shuttle  costs,  however.  One  option  is  to  re-
duce  the  Shuttle  workforce  to  a  single  shift  that  would  process  one  Shuttle  at  a
time.  (Currently,  NASA  operates  multiple  shifts,  sometimes  around  the  clock,  to
prepare  three  Shuttle  orbiters  for  flight.)  While  such  a  move  might  save  some
money, it could reduce the number of Shuttle flights that could be processed to pos-
sibly  as  few  as  two  per  year,  requiring  NASA  to  rethink  its  plans  for  completing
the Space Station by 2010.

A  second  option  under  consideration  is  integrating  the  Shuttle  program  and  the
Exploration  program  to  take  greater  advantages  of  overlapping  needs  for  workforce
skills  and  facilities.  While  this  approach  may  achieve  some  savings,  particularly
since  NASA  is  planning  to  use  at  least  some  of  the  current  Shuttle  workforce  and
infrastructure in the CEV program, NASA is not likely to fully realize such savings
in time to address these near-term shortfalls in the Shuttle’s budget.
Hurricane Katrina Response and Recovery

Hurricane  Katrina  inflicted  significant  damage  on  Stennis  Space  Center  in  Mis-
sissippi and Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana. The Michoud facility is located
just  outside  New  Orleans  and  is  the  manufacturing  facility  for  the  Space  Shuttle’s
External  Tanks.  NASA’s  cost  estimate  for  the  damage,  including  emergency  re-
sponse and programmatic costs is $760 million. To address immediate needs, NASA
has  identified  $100  million  in  available  funds—$15  from  the  Shuttle  program  and
$85  million  from  International  Space  Station  Crew/Cargo  Services  funding—that  it
has  redirected  toward  NASA’s  immediate  Katrina-related  costs.  NASA  intends  to
repay  the  Shuttle  and  Space  Station  programs  from  any  funds  that  Congress  pro-
vides in an emergency supplemental appropriation.

Last  week,  the  White  House  released  a  hurricane  relief  package  to  reallocate  ex-
isting funds to address critical needs in the Gulf region. In this package, the Admin-
istration  proposed  to  provide  NASA  with  $325  million  for  the  Michoud  and  Stennis
centers—enough  to  cover  expenses  that  would  be  incurred  between  now  and  May.
It is not clear if a further supplemental request will cover the other half of NASA’s
hurricane  expenses  or  if  it  will  have  to  find  that  money  by  reprogramming  other
fiscal year 2006 funds.
Plans for Aeronautics Research

NASA’s new plan for aeronautics will eliminate the four technology demonstration
projects that were proposed in the fiscal year 2006 Budget Request: a project in sub-
sonic noise reduction; a fuel cell powered aircraft; a project in sonic boom reduction;
and a high-altitude, long-endurance, remotely-operated aircraft. Two other programs
that were to be eliminated—hypersonics and rotorcraft—have been restored. A new
‘‘Foundational  Technology’’  program  is  being  created  to  focus  on  basic  aeronautics
research  and  to  reinvigorate  the  Agency’s  core  competencies;  and  NASA  is  realign-

ing several of its research programs to more directly address the needs of the Next
General  Air  Transportation  System,  which  NASA  is  pursuing  in  partnership  with
the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  and  other  agencies.  NASA  is  also  establishing
a new office to manage its inventory of wind tunnels.

In addition to these Agency efforts, NASA has contracted with the National Acad-
emy of Sciences for delivery of an industry/academia consensus plan that prioritizes
aeronautics  research  projects  it  believes  NASA  ought  to  pursue.  Its  report  is  due
to be delivered to NASA early next summer.

Both  the  House  and  Senate  versions  of  the  authorization  bill  and  the  House
version  of  the  appropriations  bill  direct  the  Administration  to  develop  a  National
Aeronautics Policy to guide NASA’s aeronautics research program.
Webb Telescope Cost Increase

Earlier  this  year,  NASA  announced  that  the  cost  of  the  James  Webb  Space  Tele-
scope, the planned successor to the Hubble Space Telescope and one of NASA’s high-
est  priority  space  science  programs,  would  increase  by  approximately  $1  billion  to
a  total  of  $4.5  billion.  NASA  attributed  the  cost  growth  to  higher-than-expected
costs  for  integration  and  testing,  cost  increases  for  the  instruments,  and  program
delays because of uncertainty in the selection of a launch vehicle. The cost overruns
were  especially  surprising  because  they  occurred  at  an  early  stage  of  the  program.
NASA  has  completed  a  review  of  the  various  options  to  scale-back  the  telescope
and  reduce  costs,  but  NASA  concluded  that  a  less  capable  telescope  was  less  desir-
able than slipping the schedule to complete the telescope originally envisioned. The
mission was scheduled to be launched in 2011, but has now slipped to 2013. NASA
managers assert that they have the technical content, cost, and schedule of the pro-
gram under control and do not expect that additional funding above the President’s
request will be needed in fiscal years 2006 or 2007. The detailed re-planning for the
program is scheduled to be complete in April 2006.
Workforce and Institutional Issues

The  reduction  in  aeronautics  funding  proposed  in  the  fiscal  year  2006  budget  re-
quest  could  require  the  elimination  of  1,100  civil  service  jobs  at  NASA  centers,  al-
though  NASA  has  said  that  there  will  not  be  any  layoffs  in  fiscal  year  2006.  Also,
the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2010 and shift to the CEV will require NASA
to make changes in the size and skill mix of a significant segment of the workforce
at  some  centers.  Work  on  the  CEV  and  other  elements  of  the  mission  to  the  Moon
will  significantly  help  offset  the  loss  of  Shuttle  work,  but  some  jobs  and  skills  may
still  need  to  be  eliminated.  NASA  may  be  able  to  help  affected  employees  take  ad-
vantage  of  training,  retraining,  and  job  placement  programs  to  help  the  transition.
Questions Asked of the Witness:

Administrator  Griffin  was  asked  to  describe  NASA’s  proposed  plans  and  the  ra-
tionale  for  the  changes  in  its  programs  since  he  last  testified  before  the  Committee
this past June. He was asked to focus on the following:

(1) proposed  plans  for  Exploration,  including  the  likelihood  that  NASA  will  be

able to accelerate the development of the Crew Exploration Vehicle;

(2) proposed  plans  to  revamp  the  aeronautics  research  program,  including  the

how they might affect NASA’s facilities and workforce;

(3) proposed  plans  to  reduce  funding  in  Project  Prometheus,  Human  Systems
Research  and  Technology,  and  Exploration  Systems  Research  and  Tech-
nology;

(4) the  status  of  plans  for  returning  the  Space  Shuttle  to  flight,  including  ef-
forts  to  reduce  foam  shedding  and  the  impacts  of  the  hurricanes  to  return
to flight; and

(5) the  range  of  options  under  consideration  for  flying  the  Space  Shuttle  and

assembling the International Space Station.

Critical Questions
1. Budget  Dilemma.  Given  NASA’s  proposal  to  accelerate  the  development  of  the
Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  (CEV),  a  $5  billion  shortfall  in  Shuttle  funding,  and
cost growth in other programs (like the James Webb Telescope), can NASA afford
all  the  programs  currently  in  its  portfolio  if  it  does  not  get  additional  funding
over the next five years? If not, what are some of the options you are considering
to  bring  NASA’s  overall  portfolio  in  line  with  the  currently  projected  agency
budget over the next five years?

2. Stafford-Covey Minority Report—NASA’s culture. The Stafford-Covey report
included several minority reports. One minority report stated that NASA has not
yet learned the lessons of the past, that NASA’s cultural, management, and orga-
nizational problems persist throughout the human space flight program, and that
NASA’s  leadership  and  management  shortfalls  generally  made  the  return-to-
flight  effort  more  costly  and  lengthier  than  it  needed  to  be.  Do  you  agree  with
the conclusions of the minority report? Are there observations in the minority re-
port  that  you  disagree  with?  What  are  you  doing  to  address  the  concerns  raised
by the minority report?

3. Space Station Research Cuts. Over the last year NASA has cut Space Station
research  funding  nearly  in  half,  from  more  than  $1  billion  in  FY05  to  $533  mil-
lion  for  FY06.  NASA  is  now  going  to  focus  on  exploration-related  research  and
has  cut  physical  and  life  sciences  research  on  ISS,  such  as  molecular  crystal
growth, animal research and basic fluid physics. How problematic would it be to
add  this  research  back?  Would  it  cause  significant  problems  for  your  budget  in
the outyears?

11

4. Shuttle  Budgets  FY06–FY10.  NASA’s  five-year  budget  (below)  assumes  the
Shuttle  program  will  require  less  funding  every  year  until  2010,  when  it  will  be
retired.  In  fact,  the  budget  cuts  the  Shuttle  by  nearly  $5  billion  over  the  next
five  years.  How  realistic  is  this  reduction?  We  understand  that  you  are  looking
at  scaling  the  Shuttle  workforce  back  to  a  single  shift  and  only  launching  the
Shuttle  a  couple  times  a  year.  What  impact  would  such  a  scenario  have  on  the
ISS program?

5. Hurricane Katrina Funding. The White House has asked for $325 million for
NASA  to  pay  for  Katrina-related  costs.  However,  NASA’s  believes  it  will  need  a
total of $760 million, so NASA appears to be about $435 million short. What will
be the impact in the funding shortfall? According to NASA this shortfall includes
$204  million  for  Shuttle-related  costs  that  must  be  paid  for  by  the  program,  as
well as $85 million that were taken from the funds necessary to pay the Russians
to keep the ISS going (assuming that the bill to allow such payments, which the
House  recently  passed,  is  passed  into  law).  How  will  NASA  absorb  these  addi-
tional costs? Will this shortfall delay the next Shuttle flight? Where will you get
the funding to pay Russia for Soyuz and Progress vehicles?

6. Exploration  Program  Budget.  The  Exploration  System  Architecture  Study
(ESAS)  estimated  that  the  projected  cost  of  the  program  though  2011  is  $31.3
billion.  How  confident  are  you  that  this  estimate  is  accurate?  You  have  stated
that the program can be funded within the currently projected exploration budg-
et.  However,  the  cumulative  budget  for  exploration  from  FY06  through  FY10  is
only  about  $20  billion.  Does  this  mean  you  will  need  $11  billion  in  FY11  for  ex-
ploration  alone  to  keep  the  program  on  track?  What  would  be  the  impact  of  the
schedule if the program was funded in FY11 at the FY10 level, which, according
to NASA’s five-year budget, is around $5 billion? How much would that delay the
CEV or the return to the Moon?

7. Workforce—Possible  RIF.  According  to  NASA,  the  Agency  currently  has  ap-
proximately 950 employees who are what the Agency refers to as ‘‘uncovered ca-
pacity’’—they  are  not  assigned  to  a  program  and  are  carried  by  overhead.  And
NASA has testified before this committee that it will not conduct a Reduction in
Force  (RIF)  in  FY06.  How  confident  are  you  that  NASA  will  be  able  to  get
through FY06 without a conducting a RIF? What about FY07?

Additional Questions
8. Lessons  Learned.  Administrator  Griffin,  you  have  testified  before  this  Com-
mittee that ‘‘the Shuttle is extremely expensive to use, unreliable in its logistics,
and  operationally  fragile.’’  You  said,  ‘‘the  Shuttle  has  met  none  of  its  original
goals,  despite  the  best  efforts  of  some  of  our  nations  best  engineers.’’  What  les-
sons  can  be  learned  from  the  Space  Shuttle  program  so  that  we  do  not  repeat
them  on  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle?  Where  did  we  go  wrong  then  and  what
are we doing to avoid those mistakes?

9. Historical Cost Growth. Earlier this year NASA announced that the Webb tel-
escope had a projected cost growth of $1 billion or about 30 percent. A few years
ago  the  ISS  announced  a  $5  billion  cost  increase.  According  to  the  CBO,  NASA
programs have, on average, grown in cost by 45 percent. Department of Defense
programs,  such  as  the  Space-Based  Infrared  System  and  the  National  Polar  Or-
biting Environmental Satellite System, have also had little success in controlling
costs.  Is  there  a  systemic  problem  with  how  government  and  industry  are  going
about  these  programs?  What  needs  to  be  done  to  fix  these  systemic  problems?
What  are  you  doing  to  ensure  that  these  problems  don’t  plague  the  Moon  explo-
ration program?

10. Foam  and  Debris  Problems  on  Shuttle.  The  Stafford-Covey  Task  Group
completed its review of NASA’s implementation of the Columbia Accident Inves-
tigation  Board’s  (CAIB)  return-to-flight  recommendations  and  was  not  able  to
fully close out three items: (1) External Tank debris shedding; (2) Shuttle hard-
ening  against  debris  damage;  and  (3)  inspection  and  repair  of  the  thermal  pro-
tection  system.  Do  you  concur  that  NASA  was  unable  meet  these  CAIB  rec-
ommendations? Is NASA going to continue work to try to meet these CAIB rec-
ommendations  or  have  you  done  the  best  you  can?  Given  the  problems  with
foam shedding on the recent Shuttle flight, where is NASA in solving the prob-
lem?

11. Shuttle  Schedule.  What  is  the  current  status  of  the  next  Shuttle  mission?
What  is  your  planning  date  for  that  launch,  and  what  is  your  confidence  level
that it can be achieved? How much was the launch date affected by the damage
caused by Hurricane Katrina to the Michoud Assembly Facility where the Shut-
tle External Tanks are made?

12. Shuttle  Workforce.  Administrator  Griffin,  how  can  NASA  maintain  the  focus
and technical rigor of the Shuttle workforce as the program winds down? What
actions  are  you  planning  to  take  to  ensure  that  Shuttle  employees  remain  fo-
cused on the program as it winds down?

13. Shuttle  Logistics  Carrier.  It  is  my  understanding  that  NASA  intends  to
spend  $120  million  to  develop  a  new  logistics  carrier  so  the  Space  Shuttle  can
launch unpressurized cargo to the Space Station. According to the schedule, the
new  Shuttle-based  cargo  carrier  would  not  fly  until  sometime  in  2008,  so  we
will  only  get  a  couple  years  of  use  before  the  Shuttle  is  retired  in  2010.  While
NASA  may  not  currently  have  the  capacity  to  meet  the  demand  to  launch  un-
pressurized cargo, does it make sense to develop a new capability for the Shut-
tle  at  this  time?  Isn’t  this  exactly  the  kind  of  mission  that  should  be  met
through a commercial cargo service?

14. Hubble  Servicing  Mission  Status.  Administrator  Griffin,  you  have  stated
that  you  intend  to  preserve  the  option  to  perform  a  Hubble  servicing  mission.
With  the  Shuttle  grounded,  at  least  until  May  of  next  year,  how  confident  are
you that you will still be able to perform the servicing mission? To what extent
has the delay made the decision already a foregone conclusion?

15. Shuttle  Workforce  Transition.  Can  NASA  use  employees  who  now  work  on
the  Shuttle  to  help  develop  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  or  any  other  part  of
the new Moon exploration program? If so, to what degree are the skills transfer-
able?  What  percentage  of  the  workforce  who  work  on  the  Shuttle  today  do  you
believe could work on exploration?

16. Money to Russia. The House recently passed an amendment to the Iran Non-
proliferation Act bill giving NASA relief to make purchases from Russia for ISS
through 2012, and we are optimistic that this bill will be passed by the Senate
and  signed  into  law.  How  much  money  do  you  think  that  the  U.S.  will  need  to
send to Russia through 2012 to continue the ISS? What controls will be in place
to  ensure  that  the  money  gets  to  the  appropriate  people  doing  the  work  in  the
Russian space program?

17. Russian Reliance. The U.S. is, at this time and for the foreseeable future, to-
tally  reliant  on  Russia  for  crew  rotation  and  cargo  re-supply  on  the  ISS.  Even
the  Shuttle  simply  is  not  capable  of  remaining  on  orbit  long  enough  to  provide
both these functions. What are you doing to ensure that the U.S. has a domestic
source for the critical elements we need from Russia? Will the U.S. still be reli-
ant on Russia in 2012?

18. Cost  of  CEV  Acceleration.  NASA  has  revised  its  proposed  FY06  budget  re-
quest  twice.  Both  times  funds  were  added  to  accelerate  the  CEV.  In  total,  you
have  added  $785  million  to  CEV  for  FY06  alone,  a  70  percent  increase.  This
brings the total FY06 request for CEV to nearly $2 billion. Given that you don’t
project to award the CEV contract until May and the CLV contract until June,
do  you  expect  to  spend  all  $2  billion  with  only  four  months  left  to  work  in  the
fiscal  year?  If  not,  how  far  into  FY07  would  this  funding  carry  the  program?
19. Cost  to  Return  to  the  Moon.  NASA  estimates  that  it  will  cost  $104  billion
over  the  next  13  years  to  return  to  the  Moon  by  2018.  Is  this  an  exact  figure?
How  much  confidence  do  you  have  in  this  number?  Is  the  number  an  average
of a range? If so, what is the range in the cost estimate?

20. Commitment  to  Commercial  Crew/Cargo  Services.  Administrator  Griffin,
you have stated that you are committed to pursuing commercial crew and cargo
services  to  support  the  ISS,  but  the  CEV  is  being  designed  for  these  services
as  well.  Entrepreneurs  who  want  to  provide  a  commercial  service  may  be  con-
cerned that they will be competing with a government developed solution. What
incentive  does  private  industry  have  to  invest  in  capabilities  that  have  to  com-
pete  with  government  systems?  If  commercial  providers  were  to  materialize,
what  would  be  the  role  of  the  CEV  in  servicing  ISS?  How  would  the  develop-
ment  of  options  for  commercial  crew  or  cargo  services  to  the  ISS  affect  the  de-
velopment of the CEV and CLV?

21. Role of Internationals in the Vision. What  will  be  your  approach  for  bring-
ing  international  participation  into  the  exploration  program?  Do  you  have  any
thoughts  on  lessons-learned  from  the  Space  Station  international  partnership
that might be helpful as we engage other nations with the Vision?

22. Centrifuge  Cut  from  Station.  NASA  has  recently  announced  that  the  Cen-
trifuge will not be included in the assembly of the Space Station. In 1991, both
the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  and  the  White  House  Office  of  Science  and
Technology  Policy  stated  that  a  Centrifuge  was  absolutely  vital  for  conducting
fundamental  low-gravity  research.  Why  did  you  decide  to  drop  the  Centrifuge?
Without the Centrifuge, can NASA expect to conduct this basic research on ISS?
Since Centrifuge was part of a barter arrangement with Japan in exchange for
our  launching  of  the  Japanese  Experiment  Module  (JEM),  do  you  still  plan  on
launching the JEM?

23. Aeronautics  Philosophy.  NASA  has  initiated  several  reviews  of  its  aero-
nautics  research  program.  What  guiding  philosophy  does  NASA  intend  to  use
in developing new priorities for its aeronautics research program?

24. Aeronautics Workforce. What are NASA’s near-term plans for its aeronautics
workforce?  The  FY06  budget  submission,  which  was  drafted  prior  to  your  ar-
rival, assumes that 1,000 civil servants and contractors will be cut between now
and  FY07  (increasing  to  2,000  civil  servants  and  contractors  by  FY10).  Yet  in
testimony  this  spring  before  the  Space  Subcommittee,  NASA  testified  that
workforce  reductions  would,  in  fact,  not  be  as  steep  because  of  new  work  being
parceled out to the centers. Unfortunately, NASA at the time was unable to pro-
vide  any  estimates  of  the  degree  to  which  workforce  reductions  could  be  miti-
gated  by  this  new  work.  Can  you  provide  new  details  on  NASA’s  assumptions
for its aeronautics workforce?

25. Wind Tunnels. NASA’s inventory of wind tunnels has been an issue of signifi-
cant interest to this committee. They represent a huge national investment, and
also  help  ensure  our  civil  and  military  aircraft  can  perform  as  designed.  How
does NASA plan on managing these assets?

26. Financial  Management.  During  your  last  appearance  before  this  committee
in  June,  you  called  the  status  of  NASA’s  financial  management  ‘‘deplorable.’’
What actions have you taken to address this situation? Have you seen any nota-
ble improvements in NASA’s financial management in the past four months? If
so, what are they?

27. Financial  Management  Progress.  At  a  hearing  before  this  committee  last
week,  NASA’s  Chief  Financial  Officer  indicated  that  NASA  is  making  progress
in  improving  NASA’s  financial  management  in  a  number  of  areas.  However,
NASA  continues  to  receive  the  lowest  possible  grade  (red)  in  the  President’s
Management  Agenda  scoring  for  both  the  status  of  financial  performance  and,
perhaps  more  telling,  for  progress  in  financial  performance.  Do  you  know  why
NASA still gets red marks for this area in the President’s Management agenda?
What is NASA doing to improve its score for financial performance?

Chairman BOEHLERT. The hearing will come to order.
I  want  to  welcome  Administrator  Griffin  back  to  the  Committee.
After  about  six  months  on  the  job,  I  want  to  assure  you,  you  are
still  our  hero.  You  have  retained  your  candor,  and  you  have  been
remarkably  successful  at  fulfilling  the  commitments  you  have
made.

Dr.  Griffin  has  put  in  place  a  top-notch  management  team.  He
has  put  meat  on  the  skeleton  of  the  vision  for  space  exploration,
has  taken  seriously  the  criticisms  of  NASA’s  culture,  handled  the
Shuttle’s return-to-flight responsibly, and proposed tough but need-
ed  cuts  in  several  programs,  and  has  demonstrated  his  commit-
ment  to  ensuring  that  NASA  has  robust  programs  in  aeronautics,
space science, and Earth science. This is precisely what NASA has
needed and just what we had hoped for from Dr. Griffin.

We  are,  I  think,  seeing  the  daunting  renaissance  of  NASA  in-
spired by the leadership of Dr. Griffin and his team. But a renais-
sance costs money. And I don’t see anyone waiting in the wings to
underwrite NASA. So while NASA may have relatively smooth sail-
ing right now, we ignore the clouds on the horizon at our own peril.
Here  is  what  I  mean,  and  I  will  be  blunt.  There  is  simply  not
enough  money  in  NASA’s  budget  to  carry  out  all  of  the  tasks  it  is
undertaking on the current schedule. That is a fact. The estimated
shortfall between now and fiscal year 2010 is probably between $4
billion  and  $6  billion,  and  that  is  assuming  that  the  current  cost
estimates  for  NASA  missions  are  on  the  money,  which  is  unlikely,
even  with  the  most  careful  cost  estimating.  NASA  has  gotten  in
trouble repeatedly in the past by making promises that are beyond
its financial means to fulfill.

The  Columbia  Accident  Investigation  Board,  among  others,  have
described that folly in excruciating detail. I don’t want to see us go
down that path again.

Before  NASA  promises  that  it  can  accelerate  development  of  the
Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  and  complete  construction  of  the  Space
Station  and  have  worthwhile  aeronautics  and  science  programs,  it
ought  to  be  able  to  demonstrate  where  the  money  will  come  from.
And right now, it can’t. And let me reiterate. As a supporter of the
vision,  NASA  cannot  use  aeronautics  and  science  as  a  piggy  bank
to  fund  human  space  flight.  And  I  know  Dr.  Griffin  shares  that
view.

The closest I have heard to an answer about these financial facts
is,  in  effect,  that  we  will  address  this  financial  shortfall  in  fiscal
year  2008.  That  is  not  all  that  far  away.  And  as  far  as  I  can  see,
the  only  thing  that  2008  has  to  recommend  itself  is  that  it  hasn’t
happened yet. I don’t know why anyone would assume that we are
going  to  be  flush  with  cash  in  2008.  This  ‘‘wait  until  next  year’’
mantra may be soothing for baseball fans, particularly so to me, as
a Yankee diehard, but it is a poor motto for budgeting.

Yet  we  are  starting  to  hear  it  more  and  more.  We  are  hearing
it,  for  example,  from  officials  at  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmos-
pheric  Administration  when  we  asked  how  they  are  going  to  get
their key satellite program back on track. But that is another sub-
ject for another hearing. I want to see NASA succeed. I want to see
Dr.  Griffin  succeed.  But  we  can’t  premise  that  success  on  money

that  doesn’t  exist  and  isn’t  all  that  likely  to  exist.  And  the  time  to
discuss those hard facts is now.

Congressional debate on NASA is dominated by two factions, nei-
ther  of  whom  trouble  themselves  with  this  budget  problem.  The
first and larger faction are those who don’t care much about NASA
and are particularly unimpressed with the vision. The smaller, but
more  effective  faction,  thinks  NASA  is  a  high  enough  priority  that
it  should  get  additional  money,  no  matter  how  tight  the  budget  is.
I  am  in  neither  camp.  I  support  the  vision,  but  I  think  that  it
can’t  be  allowed  to  break  the  bank  or  eat  into  NASA’s  other  pro-
grams. And I hope we can get some guidance today about how folks
like  me—folks  in  the  middle—the  swing  votes  who  can  determine
the  outcome  of  debates,  how  we  can  and  how  we  ought  to  proceed
in  this  budget  climate.  It  is  a  good  time  to  have  that  discussion.
As we are beginning negotiations on our NASA authorization bill
with  our  colleagues  on  the  other  side  of  the  capital,  and  as  Con-
gress nears agreement on fiscal year 2006 appropriations, these are
tough  questions.  But  we  have  got  the  right  man  for  the  job  at  the
helm  at  NASA  to  help  us  answer  them.  And  that  is  why  I  think
this hearing is particularly important.

Mr. Gordon.
[The prepared statement of Chairman Boehlert follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN SHERWOOD L. BOEHLERT

I  want  to  welcome  Administrator  Griffin  back  to  the  Committee.  After  about  six
months on the job, he is still our hero. He has retained his candor, and he has been
remarkably successful at fulfilling his commitments.

Dr. Griffin has put in place a top-notch management team, has put ‘‘meat’’ on the
skeleton  of  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  has  taken  seriously  the  criticisms  of
NASA’s  culture,  has  handled  the  Shuttle’s  Return-to-Flight  responsibly,  has  pro-
posed  tough  but  needed  cuts  in  several  programs,  and  has  demonstrated  his  com-
mitment  to  ensuring  that  NASA  has  robust  programs  in  aeronautics,  space  science
and Earth science. This is precisely what NASA has needed, and just what we had
hoped  of  Dr.  Griffin.  We  are,  I  think,  seeing  the  dawning  renaissance  of  NASA,  in-
spired by the leadership of Dr. Griffin and his team.

But  a  renaissance  costs  money,  and  I  don’t  see  any  Medicis  waiting  in  the  wings
to underwrite NASA. So while NASA may have relatively smooth sailing right now,
we ignore the clouds on the horizon at our peril.

Here’s what I mean, and I will be as blunt as possible: There is simply not enough
money in NASA’s budget to carry out all the tasks it is undertaking on the current
schedule. That’s a fact. The estimated shortfall between now and fiscal 2010 is prob-
ably  between  $4  billion  and  $6  billion.  And  that’s  assuming  that  the  current  cost
estimates  for  NASA  missions  are  ‘‘on  the  money,’’  which  is  unlikely,  even  with  the
most careful cost estimating.

NASA  has  gotten  in  trouble  repeatedly  in  the  past  by  making  promises  that  are
beyond  its  financial  means  to  fulfill.  The  Columbia  Accident  Investigation  Board
(CAIB),  among  others,  have  described  that  folly  in  excruciating  detail.  I  don’t  want
to see us go down that path again. Before NASA promises that it can accelerate de-
velopment  of  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle,  and  complete  construction  of  the  Space
Station  and  have  worthwhile  aeronautics  and  science  programs,  it  ought  to  be  able
to demonstrate where the money will come from. And right now, it can’t.

And  let  me  reiterate,  as  a  supporter  of  the  Vision,  NASA  cannot  use  aeronautics
and science as a piggy bank to fund human space flight. And I know that Dr. Griffin
shares that view.

The  closest  I’ve  heard  to  an  answer  about  these  financial  facts  is,  in  effect,  that
we will need to address this financial shortfall in fiscal 2008. That’s not all that far
away.  And  so  far  as  I  can  see,  the  only  thing  that  2008  has  to  recommend  itself,
is  that  it  hasn’t  happened  yet.  I  don’t  know  why  anyone  would  assume  that  we’re

(NOAA)  when  we  ask  how  they’re  going  to  get  their  key  satellite  program  back  on
track. But that’s a subject for another hearing.

I  want  to  see  NASA  succeed.  I  want  to  see  Dr.  Griffin  succeed.  But  we  can’t
premise  that  success  on  money  that  doesn’t  exist  and  isn’t  all  that  likely  to  exist.
And the time to discuss those hard facts is now.

Congressional  debate  on  NASA  is  dominated  by  two  factions,  neither  of  whom
trouble  themselves  with  this  budget  problem.  The  first  and  larger  faction  are  those
who  don’t  care  much  about  NASA,  and  are  particularly  unimpressed  with  the  Vi-
sion.  The  smaller  but  more  effective  faction  thinks  NASA  is  a  high  enough  priority
that it should get additional money no matter how tight the budget is.

I’m  in  neither  camp.  I  support  the  Vision,  but  I  think  that  it  can’t  be  allowed  to
break  the  bank  or  eat  into  NASA’s  other  programs.  And  I  hope  we  can  get  some
guidance  today  about  how  folks  like  me—folks  in  the  middle—the  swing  votes  who
can  determine  the  outcome  of  debates,  how  we  ought  to  proceed  in  this  budget  cli-
mate.

It’s  a  good  time  to  have  that  discussion,  as  we  are  beginning  negotiations  on  our
NASA authorization bill, and as Congress nears agreement on fiscal 2006 appropria-
tions.

These  are  tough  questions,  but  we’ve  got  the  right  man  for  the  job  at  the  helm

at NASA to help us answer them.

Mr. Gordon.
Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As I listened to your remarks, I am reminded, in the turn of the
century,  there  were  brothers  that  ran  for  governor  of  Tennessee,
Alf  and  Bob  Taylor,  and  they  called  it  the  war  of  the  roses.  None
of them were in the war, but one of them wore a red rose, the other
one wore a yellow rose sort of as their symbol. And during the cam-
paign,  they  debated  across  the  state,  normally  staying  together
with each—you know, together at that Best Inns or other hotels or
whatever.  And  even  to  the  point—and  sometimes  changing  their
speeches.  They  would—you  know,  so  they  would  give  the  speech
that  the  other  one  gave  the  night  before.  And  I  could  have  just  as
well taken your statements today.

And I want the audience and our Committee to know that we are
very  much  in  sync,  both  in  terms  of  our  appreciation  for  Dr.  Grif-
fin’s  ability,  as  well  as  for  the  concerns  about  the  direction  of
NASA.

So  there  are  divisions,  legitimate,  maybe,  and  not  legitimate  in
Congress  on  a  variety  of  issues,  but  on  this  committee,  at  least
from  these  two  folks,  there  are  no  divisions  on  the  statement  that
our Chairman has just made. So let that word go out.

Now  let  me  welcome  Administrator  Griffin  to  our  hearing  today.
And again, with all of the good things we all say about you, I want
to  point  out  something  that  is  not  so  good.  I  don’t  think  that  it  is
so  much  your  fault,  but  you,  ultimately,  are  responsible.  And  that
is  that  the  testimony—your  testimony  today  was  not  delivered
until 4:53 yesterday afternoon for a 10:00 a.m. hearing. I know that
OMB  has  to,  I  guess,  clear  these  things.  I  want  you  to  know  that
if  this  happens  again,  I  will  recommend  to  our  Chairman  that  we
follow Jim Sensenbrenner’s example with NSF some time back and
cancel  the  hearing.  We  simply  can’t  do  our  job  if  we  don’t  get  that
information sooner.

It has now been four months since Administrator Griffin first ap-
peared  before  this  committee  as  the  NASA  Administrator.  Since
that time, there have been a lot of changes, both to the NASA pro-
grams  and  to  the  NASA  institution.  We  need  to  hear  about  these
changes.

In addition, there were a number of important questions left un-
answered  at  the  hearing,  and  NASA’s  attempts  to  answer  them
have  raised  additional  questions,  some  of  which  I  hope  will  be  ad-
dressed  at  today’s  hearing.  When  this  committee  held  a  hearing
earlier this year on NASA’s fiscal year 2006 budget request and the
President’s  exploration  initiative,  I  said,  ‘‘I  for  one  support  the
President’s proposal if it is paid for and is sustainable.’’ I stand by
that statement.

However,  I  am  very  concerned  that  this  Administration  may  not
be  willing  to  pay  for  the  vision  that  it  presented  to  the  Nation  18
months ago. And I fear that the approach being taken to move the
vision forward over the near-term may make it very difficult to sus-
tain the initiative beyond 2008.

The  result  is  that  I  believe  we  are  no  closer  to  a  national  con-
sensus  on  the  President’s  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  than  we
were  18  months  ago.  And  that  is  unfortunate,  but  I  believe  that  it
is a reality.

And  why  do  I  say  that?  About  a  month  ago,  NASA  released  its
plan  for  carrying  out  the  exploration  initiative.  From  a  program
management  standpoint,  it  seemed  to  me  to  be  very  sensible.  It
maximized  the  use  of  existing  technology.  It  narrowed  the  focus  of
the exploration program to achieving the President’s goal of putting
American  astronaut  boots  back  on  the  Moon  by  2020.  And  it  ap-
peared  to  fit  within  the  Administration’s  proposed  exploration
budget.

Given  the  constraints  laid  down  by  the  Administration,  it  ap-
peared  to  be  the  most  efficient  means  of  meeting  the  President’s
goal.  And  I  think  that  Administrator  Griffin  and  his  team  are  to
be  commended  for  their  efforts.  Yet,  it  leads  to  the  basic  question
of ‘‘are we doing the right thing or just doing the thing right’’? That
is,  should  simply  getting  to  the  Moon  under  the  Administration’s
timetable be the Nation’s goal?

Or should the goal be to craft a long-term, human and robotic ex-
ploration  program  that  spawns  new  technologies,  engages  the  best
and brightest in our universities, and nurtures the R&D capacities
that  will  be  needed  to  meet  long-term  exploration  goals  as  well  as
carry out NASA’s other important missions?

Those  are  not  idle  questions,  given  that  NASA  is  proposing  to
spend  more  than  $100  billion  over  the  next  15  years  to  get  those
astronauts’  boots  back  to  the  Moon.  And  given  that  the  leader  of
NASA’s  Exploration  Systems  Architecture  Study  recently  acknowl-
edged that $100 billion doesn’t fund more than a couple of brief vis-
its to the Moon.

He also confirmed that the assumption of limiting NASA’s explo-
ration  budget  beyond  2010  to  inflationary  growth,  something  the
Administration  cited  when  it  announced  the  exploration  vision  to
demonstrate its ‘‘affordability,’’ won’t get anyone to Mars. To quote
him,  ‘‘When  you  try  to  fit  within  a  wedge  like  that,  you  are  not
going to have a human Mars program if you extend that out.’’

If that is the case, then it puts a premium on NASA having com-
pelling  answers  to  the  questions:  ‘‘Why  do  we  need  to  go  back  to
the  Moon  on  NASA’s  proposed  schedule;  and  what  are  we  going  to
do when we get there?’’

I  hope  that  Administrator  Griffin  can  provide  those  answers
today, but I would caution him that he is likely to face a skeptical
audience in the Congress as a whole.

That  skepticism  is  likely  to  increase  when  the  benefits  of  fol-
lowing NASA’s plans are weighed against its costs to NASA’s other
programs. For example, while it is certainly commendable that the
Administrator wants to carry out the exploration vision within the
budgetary profile that he has been given by OMB, that profile puts
NASA’s aeronautics programs on a path of continued significant de-
cline through at least the remainder of the decade.

And  while  his  intent  is  to  not  take  money  from  NASA’s  science
programs  to  support  the  exploration  vision,  the  reality  is  that
NASA’s  life  science  programs  are  being  gutted  as  we  speak,  and
non-exploration-related research is being eliminated from the Inter-
national Space Station program.

And  in  an  attempt  to  reduce  the  size  of  the  ‘‘gap’’  between  the
forced  retirement  of  the  Shuttle  and  the  eventual  deployment  of
the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle,  the  Agency  is  slashing  its  commit-
ment to a variety of research and technology programs.

Finally, just weeks after NASA announced its goal of ‘‘essentially
completing’’  the  International  Space  Station,  it  appears  that  OMB
guidance to NASA is putting the goal in serious jeopardy.

My  intent  in  citing  these  examples  is  not  to  criticize  Adminis-
trator Griffin. Rather, it is to make clear that only 21 months into
the  vision,  NASA  has  already  had  to  make  major  cuts  to  the  pro-
grams  and  contemplate  additional  restructurings  simply  to  have
the hope of meeting the President’s timetable for returning U.S. as-
tronauts to the Moon.

That  does  not  bode  well  for  the  sustainability  of  the  vision,  and
it  raises  the  fundamental  question:  is  the  Vision  for  Space  Explo-
ration an Administration priority or simply a NASA priority?

As you know, just one year after the President announced his vi-
sion for NASA, the White House cut NASA’s out-year funding plan
by over $2.5 billion. That simply worsened an already existing mis-
match between NASA’s programs and its budget.

When  the  Administration  put  forth  its  ‘‘sand  chart’’  21  months
ago  to  demonstrate  the  ‘‘affordability’’  of  the  exploration  vision,  it
assumed  deep  reductions  in  the  funding  required  to  the  Shuttle
program  in  the  years  prior  to  the  retirement.  The  realism  of
achieving those Shuttle cost reductions are questionable, but OMB
and NASA kept them in their budget plan.

And  what  is  the  result?  NASA  now  has  more  than  a  $3  billion
budget  shortfall  in  the  Shuttle  account  to  deal  with  over  the  next
several years as a result of OMB’s and NASA’s desires to construct
a budgetary plan that would support the vision. And that shortfall
could  have  a  major  impact  on  NASA’s  ability  to  meet  its  commit-
ments  to  the  International  Space  Station  program,  among  other
things.

Is  the  White  House  going  to  find  the  resources  to  correct  for  its
earlier  ‘‘low-balling’’  of  Shuttle  budgetary  requirements?  Is  the
White  House  going  to  ensure  that  the  ISS  is  a  facility  that  truly
is an integrated part of the vision and that meets our commitments
to  our  international  partners?  If  not,  it  will  be  telling  us—it  will
be  a  telling  sign  that  this  Administration  is  distancing  itself  from

its  commitment  to  the  exploration  vision  and  leaving  it  to  NASA
to pick up the pieces.

Well, I hope that Administrator Griffin will be able to shed some
light on these issues today. And again, I welcome him to this hear-
ing.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BART GORDON

Good morning. I’d like to welcome Administrator Griffin to today’s hearing.
It is now four months since he first appeared before this committee as NASA Ad-

Since  that  time,  there  have  been  a  lot  of  changes  both  to  NASA’s  programs  and

to the NASA institution. We need to hear about those changes.

In  addition,  there  were  a  number  of  important  questions  left  unanswered  at  that

ministrator.

hearing.

And  NASA’s  attempts  to  answer  them  have  raised  additional  questions—some  of

which I hope will be addressed at today’s hearing.

When this committee held a hearing earlier this year on NASA’s FY 2006 budget

request and the President’s exploration initiative, I said:

‘‘I  for  one  support  the  President’s  proposal  if  it  is  paid  for  and  is  sustainable.’’
I stand by that statement.

However, I am very concerned that this Administration may not be willing to pay
for  the  Vision  that  it  presented  to  the  Nation  21  months  ago.  And  I  fear  that  the
approach  being  taken  to  move  the  Vision  forward  over  the  near-term  may  make  it
very difficult to sustain the initiative beyond 2008.

The result is that I believe we are no closer to a national consensus on the Presi-
dent’s  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  than  we  were  21  months  ago.  That  is  unfortu-
nate, but I believe that is the reality.

Why  do  I  say  that?  About  a  month  ago,  NASA  released  its  plan  for  carrying  out

the exploration initiative.

From  a  program  management  standpoint,  it  seemed  to  me  to  be  a  sensible  plan:

• it maximized the use of existing technology;
• it narrowed the focus of the exploration program to achieving the President’s
goal  of  putting  American  astronauts’  boots  back  on  the  Moon  by  2020,  and;
• it appeared to fit within the Administration’s proposed exploration budget.

Given the constraints laid down by the Administration, it appeared to be the most
efficient  means  of  meeting  the  President’s  goal.  And  I  think  Administrator  Griffin
and  his  team  are  to  be  commended  for  their  efforts.  Yet,  it  leads  to  the  basic  ques-
tion  of  ‘‘are  we  doing  the  right  thing-or  just  doing  the  thing  right?’’  That  is,  should
simply  getting  to  the  Moon  under  the  Administration’s  timetable  be  the  Nation’s
goal?

Or should the goal be to craft a long-term human and robotic exploration program
that  spawns  new  technologies,  engages  the  best  and  brightest  in  our  universities,
and  nurtures  the  R&D  capabilities  that  will  be  needed  to  meet  long-term  explo-
ration goals, as well as carry out NASA’s other important missions?

Those  are  not  idle  questions,  given  that  NASA  is  proposing  to  spend  more  than
$100 billion over the next 15 years to get those astronauts’ boots back on the Moon.
And  given  that  the  leader  of  NASA’s  Exploration  Systems  Architecture  Study  re-
cently  acknowledged  that  the  $100  billion  doesn’t  fund  more  than  a  couple  of  brief
lunar visits.

He also confirmed that the assumption of limiting NASA’s exploration budget be-
yond  2010  to  inflationary  growth—something  the  Administration  cited  when  it  an-
nounced  the  exploration  Vision  to  demonstrate  its  ‘‘affordability’’—won’t  get  anyone
to Mars. To quote him: ‘‘When you try to fit within a wedge like that, you’re not going
to have a human Mars program if you extend that out.’’

If  that’s  the  case,  then  it  puts  a  premium  on  NASA  having  compelling  answers
for  the  questions:  ‘‘Why  do  we  need  to  go  back  to  the  Moon  on  NASA’s  proposed
schedule—and what are we going to do when we get there?’’

I  hope  that  Administrator  Griffin  can  provide  those  answers  today,  but  I  would
caution him that he is likely to face a skeptical audience in the Congress as a whole.
That  skepticism  is  likely  to  increase  when  the  benefits  of  following  NASA’s  plan
are  weighed  against  its  costs  to  NASA’s  other  programs.  For  example,  while  it  is
certainly  commendable  that  the  Administrator  wants  to  carry  out  the  exploration

Vision  within  the  budgetary  profile  he  has  been  given  by  OMB,  that  profile  puts
NASA’s  aeronautics  program  on  a  path  of  continued  significant  decline  through  at
least the remainder of the decade.

While  his  intent  is  to  not  take  money  from  NASA’s  science  programs  to  support
the  exploration  Vision,  the  reality  is  that  NASA’s  life  science  programs  are  being
gutted  as  we  speak,  and  non-exploration-related  research  is  being  eliminated  from
the International Space Station program.

And  in  an  attempt  to  reduce  the  size  of  the  ‘‘gap’’  between  the  forced  retirement
of  the  Shuttle  and  the  eventual  deployment  of  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle,  the
agency is slashing its commitment to a variety of research and technology programs.
Finally, just weeks after NASA announced its goal of ‘‘essentially completing’’ the
International Space Station, it appears that OMB guidance to NASA is putting that
goal in serious jeopardy.

My intent in citing these examples is not to criticize Administrator Griffin. Rath-
er,  it  is  to  make  clear  that  only  21  months  into  the  Vision,  NASA  has  already  had
to  make  major  cuts  to  programs  and  contemplate  additional  restructurings  simply
to have the hope of meeting the President’s timetable for returning U.S. astronauts
to the Moon.

That does not bode well for the sustainability of the Vision. And it raises the fun-
damental question: Is the Vision for Space Exploration an Administration priority—
or simply a NASA priority?

As  you  know,  just  one  year  after  the  President  announced  his  Vision  for  NASA,
the White House cut NASA’s outyear funding plan by over $2.5 billion. That simply
worsened  an  already  existing  mismatch  between  NASA’s  programs  and  its  budget.
When the Administration put forth its ‘‘sand chart’’ 21 months ago to demonstrate
the ‘‘affordability’’ of its exploration Vision, it assumed deep reductions in the fund-
ing  required  for  the  Shuttle  program  in  the  years  prior  to  its  retirement.  The  real-
ism  of  achieving  those  Shuttle  cost  reductions  was  questionable,  but  OMB  and
NASA kept them in their budget plan.

And what’s the result? NASA now has a more than $3 billion budgetary shortfall
in the Shuttle account to deal with over the next several years as a result of OMB’s
and  NASA’s  desire  to  construct  a  budgetary  plan  that  would  support  the  Vision.
And that shortfall could have a major impact on NASA’s ability to meet its commit-
ments to the International Space Station program, among other things.

Is  the  White  House  going  to  find  the  resources  to  correct  for  its  earlier  ‘‘low-ball-
ing’’  of  Shuttle  budgetary  requirements?  Is  the  White  House  going  to  ensure  that
the  ISS  is  a  facility  that  truly  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Vision  and  that  meets  our
commitments to our International Partners? I hope so. But if not, it will be a telling
sign  that  this  Administration  is  distancing  itself  from  its  commitment  to  the  explo-
ration Vision and leaving it to NASA to pick up the pieces.

Well,  I  hope  that  Administrator  Griffin  will  be  able  to  shed  some  light  on  these
issues  today.  I  again  want  to  welcome  him  to  our  hearing,  and  I  look  forward  to
his testimony.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
The  Chair  recognizes  the  Chairman  of  the  Subcommittee  on
Space and Aeronautics. And before doing so, I would like to observe
that Chairman Calvert has been tireless and has visited the NASA
Centers.  He  just  never  stops.  And  that  is  what  we  expect  of  the
Chairman,  because  he  succeeded  his  fellow  Californian,  Chairman
Rohrabacher,  who  was  just  as  indefatigable  and  just  as  energetic.
I  say  that  so  that  everyone  will  know  this  is  a  team  up  here,  and
now  it  is  Chairman  Calvert  at  the  helm  at  the  Subcommittee  that
is  working  day  in  and  day  out  to  ensure  that  we  have  the  success
that we all expect from NASA.

Chairman Calvert.
Mr.  CALVERT.  Well,  thank  you  for  that  kind  introduction,  Mr.

Chairman.

And  I  hate  to  do  this  to  you,  but  I  want  to  remind  you  that  I
am  an  Angels  fan,  and  I  am  sure  you  were  reminded  of  that  last
month.  But  I  also  am  from  the  City  of  Angels,  and  so  as  a—you
know,  originally,  and  of  course,  the  Angels  play  in  Anaheim,  but
they call themselves the Los Angeles Angels.

But by that, I am an optimist, and it is great to chair the Space
and  Aeronautics  Committee.  So  I  come  up  to  this  with  a  spirit  of
optimism,  and  I  certainly  do  that  this  morning  as  I  welcome  Ad-
ministrator  Griffin,  as  I  know  that  he  went  into  this  job  with  a
spirit of optimism, that this country can, and will, succeed.

And we welcome you back to update the Committee on the latest
developments  at  NASA  since  you  have  appeared  before  us  last
June.  You  have  had  a  lot  on  your  plate.  A  lot  of  things  have  hap-
pened.  As  you  know,  last  week,  we  were  out  there  at  John  Space
Center.  I  met  with  you  after  you  had  an  all-hands  meeting.  And
we were certainly—as you are going to mention, I suspect, in your
testimony,  anxious  to  see  the  Shuttle  return-to-flight,  which  hope-
fully  will  be  in  May  of  2006.  We  certainly  want  the  Shuttle  to  fly
when  it  is  safe,  and  we  certainly  understand  that  the  hurricane
season  has  undermined  the  plannings  to  return-to-flight,  but  as
you  know,  each  month  in  delay  of  the  Shuttle  flight  certainly  ef-
fects NASA’s credibility.

And  I  also  understand  that  an  old  friend  of  ours,  Shana  Dale,
who has been nominated to be your deputy, has sailed through her
first  step  of  the  confirmation  process,  and  she  will  be  completing
her  confirmation  hearing,  I  understand,  next  week.  And  even
though I know you are a high-energy person, we know that you will
be happy to have her on board and part of the team. She is a great
addition,  and  we  certainly  look  forward  to  working  with  her,  cer-
tainly since most of us know her and have worked with her in the
past.

The  Committee  is  anxious  to  have  you  update  us  on  a  number
of  areas  that  you  have  changed  over  the  last  few  months,  and  I
think properly so. Since we met last week, three of the NASA Cen-
ters  suffered  through  the  Hurricanes  Katrina,  Rita,  and  Wilma.
The  AC  has  come  out  with  this  Exploration  System  Architecture
Studies. NASA has just recently set up the new operations plan as
well  as  a  new  budget  amendment.  Your  Deputy  Administrator
named by the White House. You have appointed new Associate Ad-
ministrators  for  all  your  mission  directorates  under  NASA,  Aero-
nautics,  Research,  Exploration  Systems,  Space  Operations,  and
Science. In addition, some of your Centers are being reorganized to
fit  with  the  new  vision.  We  are  anxious  to  learn  how  you  will  be
moving forward on this over the next year or so.

In  my  capacity  as  Chairman  of  the  Space  and  Aeronautics  Com-
mittee,  I  have  enjoyed  working  with  you  and  to  move  around—
the—to  NASA  towards  what  I  described  as  the  second  space  age.
As you know, the first space age was born of the Cold War and was
maintained  only  so  long  as  we  were  competitive  with  the  Soviet
Union.  After  the  fall  of  the  Soviet  Union,  the  U.S.  space  program
limped along for three decades, lacking vision and leadership.

I  believe  in  this  second  space  age  we  must  feature  the  explo-
ration  of  the  universe  while  achieving  synergy  among  our  civil,
commercial, and national security space programs. With your lead-
ership, we now have the vision and leadership to provide this impe-
tus for the second space age.

Recently,  a  panel  of  experts  led  by  retired  Chairman  and  CEO
of  Lockheed  Martin,  Norman  Augustine,  issued  a  report  stating
that we—what we already know. There has been an erosion of the

United States’ competitive edge in science, engineering and mathe-
matics. Increasingly, we are seeing strides in Asia and Europe rival
or  exceed  America’s  competitive  edge  in  those  critical  areas  as
science and innovation.

Last year, according to Fortune Magazine, more than 600,000 en-
gineers  graduated  from  institutions  of  higher  learning  in  China,
350,000 in India compared to just 70,000 in the United States.

You  know,  Mr.  Administrator,  the  best  way  to  get  our  students
interested in studying these hard subjects is to have exciting things
for  them  to  work  on.  NASA  provides  the  impetus  for  future  sci-
entists  and  engineers  by  giving  the  exciting  projects  in  which  to
work and about which to dream.

So I look forward to your success, because it is not only your suc-
cess,  it  is  America’s  success.  And  quite  frankly,  I  am  an  optimist,
as  I  mentioned  in  the  beginning.  You  know.  We  will  find  the  re-
sources,  because  this  country  must  succeed  and  we  must  continue,
I think, to do the hard things.

So with that, I look forward to your testimony.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN KEN CALVERT

Good  morning,  Administrator  Griffin.  We  welcome  you  back  to  update  our  com-
mittee  on  the  latest  developments  at  NASA  since  you  last  appeared  before  us  in
June. You have a lot on your plate and a great deal has transpired in the last four
months. Most recently, several Members, and I, met with you at the Johnson Space
Center (JSC) following your all hands meeting with the JSC employees.

We are all anxiously awaiting the Shuttle’s return-to-flight, currently set for May
2006.  While  we  certainly  want  the  shuttle  to  fly  only  when  it  is  safe,  and  we  cer-
tainly  understand  that  the  hurricane  season  has  undermined  all  planning  for  the
Return-to-Flight,  each  month  delay  in  the  next  Shuttle  flight  affects  NASA’s  credi-
bility. We need to fly sooner rather than later.

I  understand  that  Shana  Dale,  who  has  been  nominated  as  your  deputy,  has
sailed  through  the  first  step  of  her  confirmation  process  this  week,  when  she  com-
pleted  her  confirmation  hearing  on  Tuesday.  Even  though  you  are  a  very  high  en-
ergy  person,  I  know  you  will  be  relieved  to  get  her  on  board  as  part  of  your  team.
She will be an excellent addition, since her past experience as a staffer of this very
committee,  will  lend  the  agency  invaluable  insight  and  support  with  the  NASA’s
continued effort to improve communications with Congress.

The Committee is anxious to have you update us in a number of areas that have
changed  over  the  last  few  months.  Since  we  last  met,  three  of  the  NASA  centers
suffered  through  hurricanes  Katrina,  Rita,  and  Wilma;  the  Agency  has  come  out
with  its  Exploration  Systems  Architecture  Studies  (ESAS);  and  NASA  has  just  re-
cently  sent  up  a  new  Operations  Plan  as  well  as  a  new  budget  amendment.  Your
Deputy Administrator has been named by the White House and you have appointed
new  associate  administrators  for  all  mission  directorates  under  NASA—aeronautics
research,  exploration  systems,  space  operations,  and  science.  In  addition,  some  of
your  centers  are  being  reorganized  to  fit  with  the  new  Vision.  We  are  anxious  to
learn how you will be moving forward over this next year or so.

In  my  new  capacity  as  Chairman  of  the  Space  and  Aeronautics  Subcommittee,  I
have  enjoyed  working  with  you  to  move  NASA  towards  what  I  describe  as  the  Sec-
ond Space Age. The first Space Age was born of the Cold War and was maintained
only so long as we were competitive with the Soviet Union. After the fall of the So-
viet  Union,  the  U.S.  space  program  limped  along  for  three  decades,  lacking  vision
and leadership.

This  Second  Space  Age  must  feature  the  exploration  of  the  Universe,  while
achieving  synergy  among  our  civil,  commercial,  and  national  security  space  pro-
grams. With your leadership, we now have the vision and leadership to provide the
impetus for this Second Space Age.

according  to  Fortune  magazine,  more  than  600,000  engineers  graduated  from  insti-
tutions  of  higher  learning  in  China,  and  350,000  in  India,  compared  to  just  70,000

students  interested  in  studying  these  hard  subjects  is  to  have  exciting  things  for
them to work on. NASA provides the impetus for future scientists and engineers by
giving them exciting projects on which to work and about which to dream. We thank
you for your service and I look forward to hearing your testimony.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Chairman  Calvert.
Distinguished Ranking Member, Mr. Udall.
Mr. UDALL. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
Since we are discussing baseball analogies this morning, and we
are  talking  about  what  a  great  team  we  are,  I  do  know  our  goal
is, with all due respect to the New York Mets, not to be where one
of  our  colleagues  suggested  the  New  York  Mets  are  at  this  point
in time, which is they are in the sixth year of their four-year plan.
And  it  is  important  to  hear  from  Dr.  Griffin  today,  so  I  don’t
want to belabor many of the points that have been made, but I did
want  to  make  it  clear  that  I  remain  a  strong  supporter  of  NASA’s
exploration program. I want to echo the concerns, but also the opti-
mism,  of  the  three  previous  Members  and  their  comments  to  Dr.
Griffin.

But  I  think  I  do  share  the  concern  we  all  have  about  the  cuts

that NASA appears to be making to other vital NASA missions.

And  I  want  to  just  cover  a  couple  of  examples  that  I  think  are

important to discuss this morning.

The first is the situation facing NASA’s life science program, and
in particular, the Space Station research in general. NASA has de-
cided  to  eliminate  the  life  sciences  Centrifuge  that  it  had,  until
now,  considered  a  centerpiece  of  the  ISS  research  program  as  well
as  a  U.S.  commitment  to  the  international  partnership.  And  it  ap-
pears  that  NASA  is  also  making  deep  and,  perhaps,  irreversible
cuts  to  NASA’s  life  science  program.  And  NASA  has  decided  that
it will no longer support fundamental and other non-exploration-re-
lated  micro-gravity  research  on  the  ISS  even  though  NASA  has
long  justified  the  Nation’s  investment  in  the  ISS  in  part  on  the
basis  of  the  terrestrial  benefits  to  be  derived  from  such  research.
Second,  despite  your  best  intentions,  Dr.  Griffin,  I  am  worried
that  NASA  is  going  to  have  great  difficulty  in  keeping  a  vital  and
robust set of space and Earth science missions on track in a tightly
constrained NASA budgetary environment.

I  hope  I  am  wrong,  because  these  science  programs,  as  well  as
the  university  research  activities  that  they  support,  are,  in  many
ways,  NASA’s  crown  jewels  in  the  eyes  of  the  general  public.  But
I do remain worried.

And  then  finally,  I  want  to  express  my  concern  over  the  NASA’s
aeronautics  program.  You  have  once  again  changed  the  manage-
ment of the program, and I want to wish the new Associate Admin-
istrator  well,  but  it  is  clear  under  the  Administration’s  current
budgetary  plan  that  her  task  will  be  to  manage  a  budget  that  will
continue to climb for the rest of the decade.

And  I  know  NASA  recognizes  the  importance  of  rebuilding  its
fundamental  research  and  technology  program  in  aeronautics.
These  budgetary  constraints  that  are  imposed  on  the  program  ap-
pear  to  make  that  rebuilding  come  at  the  cost  of  significantly

shrinking  NASA’s  R&D  that  I  believe  is  more  directly  relevant  to
the  needs  of  the  aviation  industry.  It  doesn’t  make  much  sense  to
me, and I hope that NASA can embrace a more balanced portfolio.

In that light, in that spirit, there is a lot more to discuss.
Again,  welcome,  Dr.  Griffin.  I  look  forward  to  the  spirited  ex-
change  that  I  am  sure  that  we  will  have  today  and  to  your  re-
marks.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Udall follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MARK UDALL

Good  morning.  I  want  to  join  my  colleagues  in  welcoming  Administrator  Griffin

to today’s hearing.

my opening remarks.

We  have  a  great  number  of  issues  to  examine  this  morning,  so  I  will  be  brief  in

However,  before  I  begin,  I  would  like  to  dispose  of  one  ‘‘housekeeping’’  matter.
Specifically,  Dr.  Griffin,  it  is  now  almost  two  months  since  I  submitted  some  ques-
tions  for  the  record  to  NASA  following  your  last  appearance  before  the  Committee.
It was not until yesterday that we received the responses.

As  I  think  you  can  appreciate,  it  is  difficult  for  us  to  exercise  our  oversight  re-
sponsibilities properly without timely responses from the Agency. That said, I’d now
like  to  turn  to  today’s  hearing,  and  I  want  to  echo  Ranking  Member  Gordon’s  con-
cerns.

I  remain  a  supporter  of  NASA’s  exploration  program.  I  think  it  is  important  for
the  Nation’s  human  space  flight  program  to  have  challenging  goals  beyond  low-
Earth orbit, and I support a step-by-step approach to achieving those goals.

However,  I  continue  to  be  troubled  by  the  cuts  NASA  is  making  to  other  vital
NASA  missions—cuts  that  call  into  serious  question  the  premise  that  the  explo-
ration Vision as currently implemented is truly ‘‘affordable.’’

Let  me  cite  just  a  few  examples.  First,  there  is  the  situation  facing  NASA’s  life
science  program  in  particular,  and  Space  Station  research  in  general.  NASA  has
now decided to eliminate the life sciences centrifuge that had until now been a cen-
terpiece  of  the  ISS  research  program  as  well  as  a  U.S.  commitment  to  the  inter-
national partnership.

In  addition,  NASA  is  making  deep  and  perhaps  irreversible  cuts  to  NASA’s  life
science program. And NASA has decided that it will no longer support fundamental
and  other  non-exploration-related  microgravity  research  on  the  ISS—even  though
NASA  has  long  justified  the  Nation’s  investment  in  the  ISS  in  part  on  the  basis  of
the terrestrial benefits to be derived from such research.

NASA’s  actions  are  particularly  troubling  given  the  language  on  the  importance
of  that  research  and  the  need  for  NASA  to  maintain  its  commitment  to  it  that  is
contained  in  both  the  House-  and  Senate-passed  versions  of  the  NASA  Authoriza-
tion.

Second,  despite  the  best  intentions  of  Administrator  Griffin,  I  am  worried  that
NASA  is  going  to  have  great  difficulty  in  keeping  a  vital  and  robust  set  of  space
and Earth science missions on track in a tightly constrained NASA budgetary envi-
ronment  as  those  missions  inevitably  have  to  compete  with  the  growing  demands
of the human exploration initiative.

I  hope  I  am  wrong—because  NASA’s  science  programs,  as  well  as  the  university
research  activities  that  they  support,  are  in  many  ways  NASA’s  ‘‘crown  jewels’’  in
the eyes of the general public. But I remain worried.

Finally,  I  have  to  express  my  continued  concern  over  the  state  of  NASA’s  aero-
nautics  program.  I  am  aware  that  NASA  has  once  again  changed  the  management
of that program, and I want to wish the new Associate Administrator well.

However,  it  is  clear  that  under  the  Administration’s  current  budgetary  plan  her
task will be to manage a budget that will continue to decline for the rest of the dec-
ade.  Moreover,  while  I  am  encouraged  that  NASA  recognizes  the  importance  of  re-
building its fundamental research and technology program in aeronautics, the budg-
etary  constraints  imposed  on  the  aeronautics  program  would  appear  to  make  that
rebuilding  come  at  the  cost  of  significantly  shrinking  NASA  R&D  that  is  more  di-
rectly  relevant  to  the  needs  of  the  aviation  industry  and  society  as  a  whole.  That
makes little sense to me, and I hope that NASA will embrace a more balanced port-
folio.

Well, there is much more to discuss, but I think it is more important at this point
for  us  to  hear  from  the  Administrator.  So  I  will  again  extend  a  warm  welcome  to
Dr. Griffin, and I yield back the balance of my time.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Mr. Udall.
Thank  all  of  you  for  your  participation.  And  at  this  point  in  the
record,  other  Members  are  invited  to  submit  any  statement  they
wish  to  make,  which  will  be  included  in  the  statement—in  its  en-
tirety.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good Morning. I want to thank NASA Administrator Griffin for appearing before
the Committee to provide a comprehensive update on all facets of NASA’s plans and
programs.

On June 28, 2005, the Committee held its first hearing with Administrator Griffin
to discuss a number of reviews that he had underway to restructure NASA’s explo-
ration planning, the International Space Station program, and other plans and pro-
grams. Most of the programs and equipment NASA uses and operates are expensive
and  requires  a  large  budget.  Unfortunately,  NASA  has  endured  financial  manage-
ment  problems  in  the  past  and  has  been  working  to  fix  these  ongoing  challenges.
However,  it  is  my  understanding  that  in  the  Subcommittee  on  Space  and  Aero-
nautics hearing last week, it was reported by the GAO and the NASA’s office of In-
spector  General  that  NASA  still  has  serious  hurdles  to  overcome  in  implementing
an effective financial management system.

In last fall’s fiscal year 2005 Omnibus, the appropriators gave NASA a great deal
of  latitude  in  appropriated  funds,  with  the  understanding  that  the  appropriations
committees  would  review  that  allocation  as  part  of  the  standard  Operating  Plan
process.  I  am  concerned  that  in  the  absence  of  any  clear  Congressional  direction  in
an  authorization  bill  or  in  the  FY05  appropriation,  NASA  is  making  fundamental
changes in its priorities and institutional arrangements in spite of their poor finan-
cial  management  practices.  NASA’s  track  record  on  the  credibility  of  its  cost  esti-
mates  over  the  last  several  years  is  at  best  mixed.  Overall,  I  am  supportive  of  the
mission and goals of NASA, but at the same time, we cannot ignore the half-trillion
dollar  deficit  facing  our  country.  Therefore,  it  is  critical  that  this  committee  and
Congress  must  continue  to  closely  monitor  NASA’s  funds  in  these  tight  financial
times.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  the  Administrator  and  to  hear  how  these  wide-

ranging changes will impact NASA’s future.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member.
I  would  like  to  extend  a  warm  welcome  to  Administrator  Griffin  to  today’s  hear-

ing.

As a Texan, I want to express the utmost in pride and support for NASA.
Johnson  Space  Center,  in  my  colleague  Representative  Tom  DeLay’s  district,  is  a

tremendous asset to Texas and to this nation.

This  summer,  NASA  showed  the  world  that  the  U.S.  continues  to  succeed  in  its
space  and  aeronautics  programs.  As  former  Ranking  Member  of  the  Research  Sub-
committee,  I  greatly  value  the  advances  this  nation  has  made  thanks  to  the  work
of NASA.

I believe so strongly in the importance of research and realize that many medical
breakthroughs  have  resulted  from  space  exploration  research.  Education  continues
to  be  important  to  interest  bright  minds  for  future.  We  must  not  overlook  the  need
to grow young talent.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  Administrator  Griffin  tell  us  about  changes  that  have

occurred in recent months that will make this great agency even better.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL M. HONDA

Chairman  Boehlert  and  Ranking  Member  Gordon,  thank  you  for  holding  this
hearing  today  so  that  the  Committee  can  fulfill  its  oversight  responsibilities.  Too
often  nowadays  the  oversight  responsibilities  of  this  body  are  being  neglected.  This
committee  is  not  without  blame—many  major  changes  have  been  made  within
NASA  over  the  past  two  years  without  any  hearings  being  held  by  the  Committee.

My concerns with NASA revolve around what appears to be your very short-term
focus  on  CEV  and  CLV,  to  the  detriment  of  the  long-term  activities  that  are  going
to be necessary if we are going to successfully reach Mars. The decisions I am most
familiar  with,  since  they  involve  work  that  has  been  done  at  the  Ames  Research
Center,  are  the  decision  to  eliminate  animal  research  aboard  the  International
Space  Station  and  the  decision  to  either  discontinue,  descope,  or  delay  work  in  the
area of nanomaterials.

The  ultimate  goal  of  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  is  to  send  people  to  Mars.
It’s  going  to  be  a  long  mission,  it’s  going  to  take  a  long  time  to  develop  the  tech-
nology  to  successfully  get  people  there,  and  we  need  to  learn  a  lot  about  how  our
own bodies and those of the plants and animals we will rely on for food during the
journey  will  behave  under  conditions  unlike  those  we  have  ever  experienced.  It
seems  to  me  that  by  actively  terminating  ongoing  work  in  these  important  long
range  areas,  NASA  is  guaranteeing  that  the  work  isn’t  going  to  get  started  until
later in the process. It is going to take even longer to make the breakthroughs that
will  be  needed  and  gain  the  understanding  that  will  be  needed  to  get  to  Mars,  and
it  is  going  to  cost  more  to  do  that  work  in  the  end,  too,  since  NASA  will  have  to
build up again what you’re planning to dismantle now.

I’ve  heard  this  approach  justified  as  ‘‘go  as  you  pay.’’’  This  new  nod  toward  fiscal
responsibility from the Administration is interesting, and I wish it had been applied
to  tax  cuts,  but  in  this  case  it  is  going  to  mean  that  the  goal  of  going  to  Mars  is
not  going  to  be  reached,  at  least  not  on  the  timeline  or  within  the  cost  estimates
that  the  President  proposed.  President  Kennedy  didn’t  take  this  kind  of  approach
when  he  challenged  our  nation  to  put  a  man  on  the  Moon.  In  fact,  he  noted  ‘‘the
facts of the matter are that we have never made the national decisions or marshaled
the  national  resources  required  for  such  leadership.  We  have  never  specified  long-
range goals on an urgent time schedule, or managed our resources and our time so
as to insure their fulfillment.’’

President Kennedy understood that to get to the Moon, we needed to specify long-
range  goals  and  commit  the  resources  that  would  be  needed  to  achieve  them.  And
he  recognized  that  ‘‘if  we  are  to  go  only  half  way,  or  reduce  our  sights  in  the  face
of  difficulty,  in  my  judgment  it  would  be  better  not  to  go  at  all.’’  It  seems  to  me
that  in  this  instance,  NASA  is  only  going  half  way.  The  final  goal  of  going  to  Mars
is being pushed aside so that work can be done to go back to the Moon. The singular
focus  on  the  short-term  trip  to  the  Moon  is  killing  the  long-term  effort  we  need  to
get to Mars. I know I’m not alone in these views—I understand that the Ames fed-
eral  employees  union  wrote  to  Administrator  Griffin  about  this  matter  in  the  con-
text of the cancellation of the ISS centrifuge, but never received a response.

NASA currently faces.

I  am  eager  to  learn  more  from  you  about  new  plans  to  go  to  the  Moon  and  how
this will affect the scheduled Shuttle launches that are needed to work on the Inter-

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON LEE

Chairman Boehlert, Ranking Member Gordon,

I  want  to  thank  you  for  organizing  this  important  hearing  to  discuss  the  future
of  NASA.  I  want  to  welcome  Dr.  Griffin,  the  new  NASA  Administrator  and  thank
him  for  coming  before  this  committee  this  morning.  NASA  faces  a  watershed  mo-
ment after having endured a tremendous tragedy in the Columbia disaster and now
trying to map its future with a return to the Moon and manned exploration of Mars.
Unfortunately,  while  I  wholeheartedly  support  the  work  of  NASA,  I  am  deeply
concerned  that  the  President’s  budget  does  not  meet  all  the  needs  for  future  space
exploration as we move forward in this new century. A lack of necessary budget au-
thority  makes  the  job  for  a  new  Administrator  much  more  difficult  and  brings  in

27

to  question  the  true  vision  for  NASA.  As  I  have  stated  before,  this  Administration
has  made  many  bad  budgetary  choices,  which  continue  to  push  us  further  into  a
huge  deficits  and  mounting  debt  during  the  last  four  years.  In  addition,  the  Presi-
dent  has  proposed  a  highly  questionable  plan  for  Social  Security  along  with  an  un-
certain  military  future  in  Iraq  that  in  conjunction  with  proposed  $1.6  trillion  tax
cuts will result in less funds being available for vital agencies such as NASA.

I  have  been  supportive  of  President  Bush’s  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  because
I  firmly  believe  that  the  investment  we  make  today  in  science  and  exploration  will
pay large dividends in the future. Similarly, I do not want to put a cap on the fron-
tiers  of  our  discovery,  NASA  should  aim  high  and  continue  to  push  our  nation  at
the  forefront  of  space  exploration.  However,  I  find  it  hard  to  be  more  supportive  of
the  President’s  plan,  when  I  have  no  real  specifics  as  to  what  this  plan  will  entail.
Large missions of this sort require detailed planning and as a Members of Congress
we deserve to know how exactly the President’s plan proposes to accomplish its ob-
jectives so that we can set out the proper resources and provide the necessary over-
sight.  In  addition,  the  President  stated  that  the  fundamental  goal  of  his  directive
for  the  Nation’s  space  exploration  program  is  ‘‘. . .to  advance  U.S.  scientific,  secu-
rity,  and  economic  interests  through  a  robust  space  exploration  program.’’  I  could
not agree more with that statement; unfortunately, this President’s own budget does
not  meet  the  demands  of  his  ambitious  agenda.  One  year  after  the  Administration
laid  out  a  five-year  funding  plan  for  NASA  that  was  intended  to  demonstrate  the
affordability and sustainability of the exploration initiative, the Administration sub-
mitted  a  budget  proposal  for  2006  that  would  reduce  that  funding  plan  by  $2.5  bil-
lion  over  the  next  four  years.  For  example,  in  2006,  the  Administration  is  seeking
$546  million  less  than  it  said  would  be  needed  for  NASA  in  2006  in  the  five-year
funding plan that accompanied last year’s request. In fact 75 percent of the $2.5 bil-
lion  shortfall  will  fall  to  NASA’s  science  and  aeronautics  programs.  This  kind  of
under-funding  for  vital  programs  is  unacceptable.  Again,  it  is  even  more  alarming
because  the  President  has  not  provided  a  detailed  plan  as  to  how  he  intends  to  ac-
complish  his  space  exploration  agenda;  certainly  draining  money  from  the  budget
will not help that cause. I hope Administrator Griffin will be able to shed some light
on the vision of NASA with the current budget shortfalls.

My  greatest  concern  at  this  point  is  that  we  may  not  allocate  enough  money  or
resources to ensure the safety of all NASA astronauts and crew. After the Columbia
disaster,  safety  must  be  our  highest  priority  and  it  is  worrisome  that  there  is  not
a  noticeable  increase  in  funding  to  address  all  safety  concerns.  Presently,  NASA  is
working  towards  a  resumption  of  Space  Shuttle  flights,  with  the  date  for  such  a
launch  in  uncertainty  at  this  point.  However,  once  NASA  returns  the  Shuttle  to
flight  status,  it  is  then  supposed  to  begin  the  task  of  figuring  out  how  to  retire  the
Space Shuttle fleet in 2010 while continuing to fly the Shuttle safely up to the very
last flight. I am concerned that pressure to retire the Shuttle by a fixed date to free
up resources for other activities, coupled with the need to fly up to 28 Shuttle flights
to  assemble  the  Space  Station,  could—if  not  handled  properly—lead  to  the  types  of
schedule  and  budgetary  pressures  that  were  cited  by  the  Columbia  Accident  Inves-
tigation Board (CAIB) as contributing to the Columbia accident. I hope this concern
is paramount at NASA as we move forward in the future.

As  Members  of  this  committee  know  I  have  always  been  a  strong  advocate  for
NASA. My criticism of the President’s budget and its relation to the vision for NASA
is  intended  only  to  strengthen  our  efforts  to  move  forward  as  we  always  have  in
the  area  of  space  exploration  and  discovery.  NASA  posses  an  exciting  opportunity
to charter a new path that can lead to untold discoveries. As always I look forward
to  working  with  the  good  men  and  women  of  NASA  as  we  push  the  boundaries  of
our world once again.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  So  that  you  don’t  think  this  is  a  complete
love  inn,  there  are  some  issues  where  there  is  disagreement  up
here.  I  have  heard  Mr.  Gordon’s  statement  and  Mr.  Udall’s  state-
ment,  and  there  is  one  area  where  there  is  a  difference  of  opinion.
I  fully  support,  Mr.  Administrator,  your  proposed  cuts  in  Space
Station  research  and  technology  development  programs.  Those
aren’t the science programs that I am most worried about.

So  I  think  you  are  right  on  line  with  the  way  in  which  you  are
proceeding.  And  so  I  want  to  make  sure  that  that  is  clarified  for
all.

Let  me  start  by  saying—oh,  yeah.  You  know  what?  I  was  going

to skip you.

Dr. GRIFFIN. Actually, that would be just fine.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  With  that,  let  me  welcome  the  Adminis-

trator of NASA, Dr. Griffin.
STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL D. GRIFFIN, ADMINISTRATOR,

NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Boehlert,  Ranking  Member
Gordon,  Subcommittee  Chair  Calvert,  Ranking  Subcommittee
Member  Udall,  for  inviting  me  to  appear  before  you  to  provide  an
update on NASA’s plans and programs since I appeared last June.
I  do  respectfully  request  that  all  sports  analogies  from  here  on
out, however, be golf analogies so that I can understand the meta-
phor being used. But with that——

Chairman BOEHLERT. Without objection, so ordered.
Dr. GRIFFIN. Thank you.
A  lot  has  happened  since  last  June,  and  I  believe  that  NASA,
with  your  help,  has  made  some  steady  progress.  It  has  not  been
easy.  The  NASA  family  has  suffered  setbacks,  especially  in  the
aftermath of Katrina. A lot of work needs to be done, and we need
this  subcommittee’s—this  committee’s  help  in  maintaining  our
progress.

That  makes—that  includes  the  difficult  progress—the  difficult
yet  steady  progress  we  are  making  in  NASA’s  Financial  Manage-
ment System, the subject of Chairman Calvert’s hearing last week.
Chairman  Boehlert,  in  your  letter  of  invitation,  you  asked  me  to
provide  the  Committee  with  an  update  on  a  number  of  issues.  We
are  working  in  a  dynamic  environment.  I  hope  the  Committee  will
understand that we are still in the throws of numerous issues aris-
ing  from  the  Shuttle  program  following  our  first  test  flight  in  the
return-to-flight  sequence,  the  effects  of  Hurricane  Katrina  on  the
Shuttle program, and the formulation of the 2007 budget.

With  that  said,  I  will  try  to  answer  your  questions  to  the  best

of my ability.

But first, on behalf of NASA, I do wish to thank the many Mem-
bers  of  this  committee  and  the  Congress  as  a  whole  for  helping  us
resolve certain legislative restrictions that were placed on coopera-
tion  with  Russia  that  would  have  prevented  with  crew  rescue  sup-
port  for  the  Station  and  necessitated  U.S.  astronauts  de-crewing
Space Station.

The  Administration  maintains  our  nation’s  nonproliferation  ob-
jectives,  but  does  recognize  the  value  of  effective  cooperation  with
our  Space  Station  partners.  We  just  recently  celebrated  our  fifth
consecutive year of continuous human presence on board the Inter-
national  Space  Station.  With  your  help,  we  hope  to  celebrate  a
sixth.

We  are  now  working  with  the  Senate  on  this  legislation  so  that
our astronauts can continue to train on the Russian Soyuz vehicle.
So  again,  thanks  to  you  and  to  your  staff  for  helping  with  this
problem.

Now to your questions.
Since  last  June  when  we  met,  NASA  conducted  the  first  of  our
return-to-flight  missions  with  the  Space  Shuttle  Discovery  com-

manded by Eileen Collins. The flight was safe, but not without sur-
prises.  Cameras  onboard  the  external  tank  showed  that  we  still
had  not  completely  solved  the  foam-shedding  problem.  We  char-
tered a new and independent ‘‘tiger team’’ to look into this problem.
We  think  we  understand  what  went  wrong  with  our  workmanship
on  the  external  tank  foam  and  that  we  will  be  able  to  fly  our  sec-
ond  flight  with  the  Space  Shuttle  Discovery  commanded  by  Steve
Lindsay next May.

Since  the  last  Shuttle  flight,  NASA’s  Michoud  Assembly  Facility
near  New  Orleans  and  Stennis  Space  Center  in  Mississippi,  both
facilities  critical  to  the  Space  Shuttle  program,  suffered  the  dev-
astating effects of Hurricane Katrina.

NASA is, in fact, forever in debt to the 37 volunteers who stayed
behind  to  ride  out  the  storm  at  the  Michoud  facility.  The  ride-out
crew  positioned  sandbags,  reinforced  doors,  and  most  importantly,
operated  four  diesel  generators  when  municipal  power  failed  in
order to protect the facility and the space flight hardware from the
storm.  Most  importantly,  these  diesel  engines  pumped  more  than
one  billion  gallons  of  rainwater  away  from  the  levy  to  prevent
flooding  of  the  830-acre  facility.  With  14  inches  of  rain  and  150
mile-per-hour  winds,  every  building  on  the  Michoud  facility  suf-
fered  structural  damage  while  the  surrounding  area  was  com-
pletely devastated. Today, there are almost no businesses or habit-
able homes within a 10-mile radius of Michoud.

Almost  d  of  our  personnel,  1,500  out  of  2,000  who  work  there,
have  returned  even  though  some  of  them  have  slept  in  offices  in
hallways because they have no homes to which to go.

In  addition  to  Michoud,  Stennis  Space  Center  in  Gulfport,  Mis-
sissippi was the FEMA Command Center in the region after Hurri-
cane  Katrina  and  provided  medical  care  and  food  to  over  3,000
evacuees.  Men  and  women  at  Stennis  were  instrumental  to  the
search and rescue as well as recovery operations in the devastated
region.

All  NASA  Centers  have  contributed  resources  and  people  to  this
effort.  These  efforts  are  nothing  short  of  heroic.  Both  facilities  are
critical  to  Space  Shuttle  operations,  as  Michoud  manufactures  the
external  tank  and  Stennis  test  fires  the  engines.  Because  of  their
dedication  to  human  space  flight,  we  are  still  able  to  conduct  the
modifications  needed  on  the  external  tanks  for  the  next  Shuttle
mission, and last week, Stennis test fired a Shuttle main engine in
preparation for that flight.

Last  week,  the  Administration  submitted  to  Congress  a  supple-
mental  appropriation  for  NASA  of  approximately  $325  million  to
deal with the damage to Michoud and Stennis, and the Administra-
tion  may  seek  future  supplemental  appropriations  as  we  continue
to deal with the aftermath of Katrina.

But  NASA  has  many  other  uncertainties  remaining  with  the
costs of operating the Shuttle, and we are dealing with these issues
on  a  daily  basis.  We,  therefore,  ask  Congress  for  some  measure  of
transfer  authority  between  budget  accounts  in  order  to  deal  with
unforeseen  Shuttle  costs  and  day-to-day  problems  in  returning  the
Shuttle  to  flight.  We  need  this  committee’s  help  in  granting  that
transfer  authority,  and  I  promise  you  that  NASA  will  keep  the
Congress fully informed, if it is granted.

Mr.  Chairman,  in  your  letter,  you  asked  me  to  address  the  im-
pacts of the hurricanes on return-to-flight. While I am confident of
our technical ability to return the Shuttle to flight next year, I am
concerned  about  longer-term  consequences  of  the  hurricanes  over
the  next  several  years.  There  remains  uncertainty  about  whether
or  not  we  will  have  an  adequate  workforce  to  return  to  Michoud.
NASA’s  external  tank  production  capability  depends  on  that  work-
force, and we still need to manufacture several more Shuttle tanks
to achieve NASA’s desired 19 flights, which consist of 18 for Space
Station  assembly  and  one  for  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  between
now and the end of September 2010.

For this reason, our planned flight sequence is ordered such that
less critical logistics flights are at the end of the sequence, and we
are  not  focusing  solely  on  the  exact  number  of  Shuttle  flights  to
achieve  the  goal  of  assembling  the  Station  and  providing  adequate
logistics  before  commercial  ISS  crew  cargo  capabilities  or  the  CEV
come online.

Moving  to  some  of  the  other  questions  you  have  had,  last  Sep-
tember, NASA provided to the Congress our Space Exploration Ar-
chitecture plans with the Crew Exploration Vehicle and the launch
systems  supporting  missions  to  the  International  Space  Station,
Moon, and Mars. We briefed many of you and your staff on the de-
tails of this architecture.

As the President articulated in his budget amendment for NASA
last  July,  NASA  is  redirecting  funds  to  accelerate  development  of
the  CEV.  I  wish  to  emphasize,  this  is  not  new  money.  It  is  not  a
plus-up  for  NASA.  We  are  redirecting  resources  within  NASA  to
make  the  CEV  available  as  soon  after  Shuttle  retirement  as  pos-
sible.

We realize that there are many pressures on the federal budget,
and  we  have  adopted  a  ‘‘go-as-you-can-afford-to-pay’’  approach  to-
ward space exploration.

But  it  is  important  to  recognize  that  the  Vision  for  Space  Explo-
ration is not about new money for NASA; it is about redirecting the
money that we have.

Now  this  philosophy  also  means  that  NASA  must  set  priorities
among  the  goals  of  the  exploration  architecture  itself.  As  I  have
said  to  this  committee,  and  as  you,  Chairman  Boehlert,  said  mo-
ments ago, NASA simply cannot afford to do everything on its plate
today.  We  must  focus  our  efforts  on  those  technologies  which  sup-
port the urgent requirements of the exploration architecture. Thus,
we are de-scoping, discontinuing, or deferring several research and
technology  projects,  including  some  that  I  believe  we  will  eventu-
ally need, like surface nuclear power systems. But these projects do
not  support  the  CEV  and  its  associated  launch  systems  and  so
must be deferred.

We  are  also  deferring  a  number  of  research  activities  on  the
Space Station until after the CEV comes online, we hope, by 2012,
because we simply cannot afford to do that research today.

Over  the  long  run,  our  research  efforts,  as  well  as  the  research
of  other  government  agencies,  like  the  National  Institutes  of
Health,  commercial  industry,  and  our  international  partners,  will
benefit  from  the  expedited  development  of  the  CEV  and  an  accom-
panying ISS commercial crew and cargo capability.

So let me be clear. The primary objective of the exploration archi-
tecture for the next several years is not an immediate return to the
Moon, but it is to develop a new capability to carry humans to low-
Earth  orbit  and  beyond,  following  the  orderly  retirement  of  the
Space  Shuttle.  This  is  absolutely  essential  if  we  wish  to  maintain
our  leadership  role  in  space  exploration.  Painful  choices  must  be
made,  and  we  must  suborn  other  priorities  to  that  primary  objec-
tive.

Mr.  Chairman,  you  also  asked  me  to  address  NASA’s  proposed

plans to reinvent aeronautics research.

We  are  working  closely  with  the  White  House  Office  of  Science
and  Technology  Policy  to  coordinate  this  national  aeronautics  re-
search  policy  with  other  agencies,  like  the  Department  of  Defense
and FAA. Our primary goal is to re-establish our dedication to the
mastery  and  intellectual  stewardship  of  the  core  competencies  in
subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flight. And we will work close-
ly  with  the  universities  and  industries,  where  appropriate,  to  do
that.

We plan to invest in our in-house expertise to ensure that NASA
remains  a  world-class  resource  with  personnel,  facilities,  knowl-
edge,  and  experience  ready  to  be  drawn  upon  by  the  civilian  com-
munity, other government agencies, and industry.

NASA’s  new  Associate  Administrator  for  Aeronautics,  Dr.  Lisa
Porter,  has  briefed  several  Members  of  Congress  and  your  staff,
and she will continue to keep you informed as NASA further devel-
ops  our  aeronautics  research  plans  and  budgets,  including  our
stewardship  of  NASA  wind  tunnels  to  expand  the  range  of  flight
regimes.

Our  nation  needs  to  remain  on  the  cutting-edge  of  aeronautics
research.  We  will  need  your  help,  as  well  as  that  of  our  partners,
in turning that goal into a reality.

NASA’s  science  program  has  accomplished  a  great  deal  since  I

last reported to you.

On  the  4th  of  July,  we  created  our  own  fireworks  display  when
the  Deep  Impact  mission  slammed  into  a  comet  at  23,000  miles-
per-hour.  We  launched  the  Mars  reconnaissance  orbiter  last  sum-
mer,  and  we  hope  to  soon  launch  Calypso  and  Cloudset  Earth
science missions.

After  the  next  Shuttle  mission,  NASA  will  determine  and  will
convey  to  you  whether  we  believe  that  we  can  conduct  another
servicing  mission  to  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  with  the  Space
Shuttle.  The  Hubble  continues  to  unlock  the  mysteries  of  the  uni-
verse,  so—such  as  earlier  this  week,  NASA  scientists  discovered
two moons orbiting Pluto using the Hubble Telescope.

NASA  also  plans  to  launch  New  Horizons  to  Pluto  early  next
year. As I reported to this committee earlier, we are conducting an
in-depth  review  of  the  technical  challenges  and  cost  projection  of
the  James  Webb  Space  Telescope.  I  will  report  back  to  you  early
next year about our plans with that mission.

A  lot  has  happened  since  I  appeared  before  your  committee  in
June.  We  have  been  busy  at  work,  and  we  are  making  steady
progress.

I  would  like  to  leave  you  with  this  thought.  To  me,  space  is  the
frontier  for  societies  of  the  21st  century  and  beyond.  Americans

have pioneered frontiers of land, sea, and air in the past. We must
accept  the  challenge  of  this  new  frontier  as  well.  Where  others  go,
America must be prepared to lead.

There is a lot more to discuss with you and the Members of this
committee,  so  I  will  stop  here  and  answer  your  questions  more  di-
rectly.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL D. GRIFFIN

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to
appear  today  to  update  the  Committee  on  NASA’s  plans  for  the  future  and  our
progress  in  implementing  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration.  Since  testifying  before
the  Committee  in  June  of  this  year,  NASA  has  made  substantial  progress  in  defin-
ing  a  safe  and  sustainable  approach  to  a  program  of  renewed  space  exploration  be-
yond  low-Earth  orbit,  while  maintaining  a  balanced  program  for  Exploration  Sys-
tems,  Space  Operations,  Science,  and  Aeronautics  Research.  This  necessitates  that
we carefully weigh all the changes and adjustments we are making in our transition
work  to  assure  that  the  exploration  program  results  in  a  safer  and  more  reliable
access to space while we continue to perform NASA’s mission safely with the Shut-
tle.

• We  have  defined  the  architecture  for  space  exploration,  and  outlined  our
plans for development of the Crew Exploration Vehicle and associated launch
and support systems.
• We  have  adopted  a  ‘‘go-as-you-can-pay’’  approach  toward  space  exploration,
and  have  set  clear  priorities  and  made  difficult  choices  to  remain  within  the
budget for exploration.
• We better understand the problem of foam insulation being released from the
Space Shuttle external tank. This problem was identified by the cameras that
we added to refine our understanding of this issue that, despite our best engi-
neering  judgment,  surprised  us  during  the  launch  of  Discovery  (STS–114)  in
July.  Following  the  recommendations  of  the  ‘‘tiger  team’’  charged  with  ad-
dressing the newest instance of foam loss, we have defined the improvements
necessary  to  fly  again  and  will  replace  and  modify  areas  of  insulation  on  the
external  tank  from  which  foam  was  shed.  The  design  of  our  future  transpor-
tation systems eliminates this problem by placing payloads on top of the pro-
pellant tanks, rather than on the side as with the Shuttle orbiter.
• We have completed the Shuttle/Station Configuration Options Team (SSCOT)
study to evaluate options for the assembly and utilization of the International
Space Station (ISS), taking into account the President’s decision to retire the
Space  Shuttle  by  2010,  while  still  honoring  U.S.  commitments  to  the  Space
Station International Partners. Based in part on this assessment, we have de-
veloped a plan to move forward and begun discussions with our international
partners.
• We  established  a  new  balance  among  planetary  science,  Earth  science,  solar
• We  are  reshaping  our  Aeronautics  research  program  to  focus  on  core  com-
petencies,  activities  appropriate  to  NASA’s  unique  capabilities,  and  activities
that  directly  address  the  needs  of  the  Next  Generation  Air  Transportation
System in partnership with other agencies.

physics, and astronomy within the overall science program.

As  requested  in  your  invitation  to  testify,  the  remainder  of  my  statement  will
elaborate further on NASA’s progress in each of the areas mentioned above. In addi-
tion,  I  would  like  to  update  the  Committee  on  our  progress  in  two  other  areas  crit-
ical to NASA’s success—retaining a robust science portfolio and ensuring a balanced
workforce  skill  mix  and  productive  NASA  Centers  to  complete  the  Agency’s  work
over many years.
NASA Plans for Exploration

As  communicated  to  the  Committee  by  letter  dated  September  19,  2005,  NASA
has  completed  the  Exploration  Systems  Architecture  Study  (ESAS),  which  outlines
NASA’s approach to implementing the Vision for Space Exploration. The Vision calls
for  the  Agency  to  return  the  Space  Shuttle  to  flight,  complete  the  International
Space Station (ISS), and move on to the exploration of the Moon, Mars and beyond.

33

Based  on  the  ESAS  recommendations,  NASA  has  now  laid  out  a  detailed  plan  to
support  sustained  human  and  robotic  lunar  exploration  operations,  accelerate  the
development  of  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  (CEV)  and  launch  systems  for  mis-
sions  to  the  ISS,  Moon,  and  Mars,  and  identify  key  technologies  required  to  enable
this exploration architecture.

This  plan  offers  a  safe  and  sustainable  approach  to  space  exploration.  An  impor-
tant aspect of this plan is that it is a ‘‘go-as-you-can-pay’’ approach, within planned
budgets for Exploration Systems, through redirection of funding for longer-term and
lower-priority  research  and  technology  (R&T)  elements  within  the  Exploration  Sys-
tems  Mission  Directorate  (ESMD).  The  resulting  exploration  program  implements
the ESAS recommendations.

NASA’s  goal  is  to  deploy  the  next  human  space  flight  system,  the  Crew  Explo-
ration  Vehicle  (CEV)  not  later  than  2012.  The  first  flights  will  be  to  the  ISS,  but
the primary goal of the CEV is to support subsequent exploration efforts, including
human return to the Moon for week-long stays as early as 2018, but not later than
2020.  Longer-duration  human  presence  on  the  Moon  is  targeted  for  2022.  This  is
accomplished by redirecting existing funding for longer-term and lower-priority R&T
elements within the ESMD, while focusing on those R&T activities that support the
acceleration of the CEV, launch systems, and high-priority, long-lead items.

As  we  move  forward,  NASA  will  continue  working  closely  with  our  International
Partners  to  determine  how  they  may  best  contribute  to  the  Vision  for  Space  Explo-
ration.  NASA  will  develop  the  transportation  infrastructure  needed  to  carry  crews
and cargo to and from the lunar surface. We hope to work with other space agencies
to  extend  this  core  capability  and  expand  the  range  of  activities  we  carry  out  on
the  lunar  surface.  We  also  hope  to  cooperate  with  them  on  robotic  precursor  mis-
sions and planning for eventual human missions to Mars.

NASA also needs a strong partnership with industry. We will release a draft CEV
Call  for  Improvements  (CFI)  in  the  December/January  timeframe,  and  we  are  pur-
suing innovative programs to encourage entrepreneurs. Later this month NASA will
issue a draft solicitation requesting commercial service demonstrations for ISS crew
and  cargo  delivery  and  return.  Where  commercial  providers  have  demonstrated  the
ability  to  meet  NASA  needs  and  safety  requirements,  commercial  services  will  be
purchased instead of using government assets and operations.

However,  NASA  needs  more  than  vibrant  international  and  commercial  partner-
ships; we need a strong, dedicated workforce that can clearly articulate what needs
to be done and then they make sure it gets done right. We need healthy NASA cen-
ters  that  fully  utilize  their  unique  strengths,  and  work  together  to  turn  the  Vision
for  Space  Exploration  into  reality.  As  we  gear  up  to  accelerate  CEV  and  CLV,  all
NASA Centers have been assigned enhanced roles and responsibilities to accomplish
our exploration goals.
Setting Priorities Within Exploration Systems

On  September  30,  2005,  NASA  provided  a  detailed  FY  2005  Operating  Plan  up-
date  to  all  of  the  Committees  in  Congress  which  oversee  NASA.  Within  this  Oper-
ating Plan update, we outlined how the Agency would accelerate development of the
CEV  and  the  Crew  Launch  Vehicle  (CLV)  while  remaining  within  planned  budget
guidance for Exploration Systems.

In  the  FY  2006  Budget  Amendment,  $292  million  was  identified  as  moving  from
R&T  activities  into  the  Constellation  Systems  program  for  CEV  and  CLV  accelera-
tion.  Following  the  results  of  the  ESAS,  an  additional  $493  million  is  identified  to
be  redirected  from  R&T  activities  to  CEV  and  CLV.  This  yields  a  total  shift  from
R&T  to  Constellation  in  FY  2006  of  $785  million,  relative  to  original  plans  for  FY
2006.

CEV  and  CLV  development  requirements  directly  drive  the  content  of  ESMD’s
R&T  components.  This  includes  Exploration  Systems  Research  and  Technology
(ESR&T),  Human  System  Research  and  Technology  (HSR&T),  and  Prometheus.
Focus is shifted from advancing technologies for long-term requirements to directed
research and maturing technologies for near-term use. As a result of these R&T re-
quirements,  ESMD  is  undertaking  transitional  activities  within  the  ESR&T  and
HSR&T  programs  to  suspend  expenditures  on  specific  R&T  tasks  that  will  not  be
continued in FY 2006. FY 2006 funding made available as a result of this transition
will  be  redirected  to  the  Constellation  Systems  program  to  enable  timely  develop-
ment  of  the  CEV  and  CLV.  Realignment  of  ESR&T  tasks  is  necessary  also  to  ad-
dress  the  technology  development  priorities  for  lunar  exploration.  New  technology
development activities will be initiated beginning in FY 2006 and will be performed
by NASA Centers. Major new work in ESR&T beginning in FY2006 includes devel-
opment  of  variable  thrust  rocket  engines  that  use  methane  and  liquid  oxygen  pro-
pellants,  thermal  protection  system  materials,  and  an  auxiliary  power  system  for

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:19 May 22, 2006 Jkt 024151 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\110305\24151 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

34

the CLV. Realignment of HSR&T tasks will shift focus on primary crew health and
performance for exploration missions, while reducing tasks in Life Support and Hab-
itation,  Human  Health  and  Performance,  and  Human  Systems  Integration.  Addi-
tional detail is below.

• Human Systems Research and Technology (HSR&T):

NASA  is  focusing  HSR&T  funding  on  program  elements  that  mature  tech-
nologies needed to support lunar sortie missions and ISS access, while reduc-
ing program elements targeting longer-term or lower priority needs. As NASA
concentrates the use of the Shuttle on ISS assembly, some ISS utilization will
be deferred. As a result, transitional action is being taken now to reduce and/
or  discontinue  approximately  34  contracts  and  activities  previously  planned
at  $344  million  in  FY  2006.  After  termination  costs  and  buyouts,  these  ac-
tions will yield $243 million in FY06 that will be applied toward accelerating
the CEV and CLV.

• Exploration Systems Research and Technology (ESR&T):

NASA  is  realigning  projects  to  support  the  ESAS  recommended  architecture
requirements. This realignment has resulted in a focused and phased require-
ments  driven  R&T  program  in  which  some  projects  are  curtailed,  some  are
adjusted,  and  some  are  added.  Ongoing  projects  are  streamlined  to  deliver
Technology  Readiness  Level  6  capabilities  when  needed  (system  preliminary
design review) so as to enable the CEV, launch systems, and lunar lander de-
velopment  schedules.  Examples  of  technology  projects  focused  on  the  near-
term  include  ablative  thermal  protection  and  liquid  oxygen-methane  propul-
sion  for  CEV.  Additional  work  will  be  phased  in  after  the  first  few  years  for
lunar  lander  propulsion  systems  and  nontoxic  power  and  reaction  control  for
launch vehicles. Funding for technologies applicable to lunar surface systems,
such  as  in  situ  resource  utilization  (ISRU),  are  deferred  and  phased  in  only
during  the  out  years.  Discontinued,  descoped  or  delayed  technology  projects
include  nanomaterials,  inflatable  structures,  large-scale  solar  power,  intel-
ligent robotic systems, in space assembly, Mars mission specific technologies,
and electric propulsion. Transitional action is being taken now to discontinue
plans  for  80  tasks  and  activities,  previously  planned  at  $206  million  in  FY
2006,  which  do  not  directly  support  ESAS  architecture  or  schedule  require-
ments.  These  actions  will  yield  $174  million  in  FY  2006  that  will  be  applied
towards accelerated development of CEV and CLV.

• Prometheus Nuclear Systems and Technology (PNS&T):

Prior to the completion of the ESAS study, NASA was planning to restructure
the  Prometheus  Nuclear  Systems  and  Technology  (PNS&T)  program  to
prioritize NASA’s nuclear technology development efforts to provide power on
the surface of the Moon for a lunar outpost. ESAS results indicate that, given
resource constraints, surface nuclear power systems to support potential long-
duration stays on the Moon will not be required until after 2018. Nuclear pro-
pulsion  will  not  be  required  until  planning  for  Mars  missions  begins  in  ear-
nest.  The  result  of  the  findings  is  a  total  reformulation  in  the  nuclear  pro-
gram,  deferring  all  work  until  it  is  needed,  yielding  $76  million  in  FY  2006
to  accelerate  development  of  CEV  and  CLV.  Funding  at  these  lower  levels
also  assumed  that  remaining  JIMO  project  activity  was  concluded  at  the
Phase A Project Mission Systems Review milestone and that support for Pro-
metheus  by  the  DOE’s  Office  of  Naval  Reactors  will  not  continue.  NASA  has
contacted the Office of Naval Reactors to initiate planning for termination ac-
tions  on  activities  covered  by  the  Memorandum  of  Understanding  between
NASA  and  DOE  (National  Nuclear  Security  Administration-Naval  Reactors)
regarding  Civilian  Space  Nuclear  Reactors.  The  bulk  of  the  remaining  FY
2005  and  projected  FY  2006  funds  for  this  activity  will  be  spent  on  termi-
nation costs. NASA will continue a low level of funding for key, high-priority,
nuclear system R&T issues, with longer-term plans to increase funding in the
future, as the need for long duration lunar and Mars applications approaches.

Status of Returning the Space Shuttle to Flight

The  first  step  in  pursuing  the  exploration  vision  is  to  return  the  Space  Shuttle
safely to flight in order to complete the assembly of the ISS, and then to retire the
Shuttle  from  service  by  the  end  of  FY  2010.  Following  the  loss  of  foam  insulation
from  the  Space  Shuttle’s  External  Tank  (ET)  during  the  launch  of  Discovery  (STS–
114) in July, we established a ‘‘tiger team’’ to review various manufacturing aspects
of  the  insulation  and  implications  that  the  foam  loss  will  have  for  future  vehicles.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:19 May 22, 2006 Jkt 024151 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\110305\24151 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

35

The team reviewed the STS–114 environments, processing steps, and materials. Our
engineers have identified several potential causes for the foam loss. Although a sin-
gle  specific  cause  cannot  be  isolated,  these  same  engineers  have  developed  fixes  to
control  all  potential  causes,  and  Shuttle  workers  will  likely  replace,  using  more
carefully  controlled  procedures,  the  areas  of  insulation  on  the  external  tank  where
foam  came  loose  during  the  July  launch.  Plans  to  inspect  and  repair  the  tanks  in
Michoud are complete, and the repair work has already begun.

The  next  Shuttle  mission,  also  on  Discovery,  will  be  the  second  test  flight  in  the
Return-to-Flight  sequence.  While  we  have  not  set  a  specific  launch  date,  we  are
using  the  May  3  to  23,  2006,  launch  window  as  a  target  for  work  to  prepare  Dis-
covery for the mission. Factors contributing to the decision to target the May launch
window  include  outstanding  tank  work  and  the  effect  on  the  NASA  workforce  by
Hurricane  Katrina.  NASA’s  Michoud  Assembly  Facility  near  New  Orleans  and  the
Stennis  Space  Center  in  Mississippi  were  in  the  storm’s  path,  and  much  of  their
workforce  has  been  displaced  by  the  storm.  Since  external  tanks  are  manufactured
at Michoud, work there is crucial. Approximately 25 percent of the workforce is back
on the job. If improvements to transportation and infrastructure go as planned, the
full staff could be back at work in December.
Status of Katrina Recovery and Repair

As  a  result  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  significant  damage  was  sustained  by  NASA’s
Stennis  Space  Center  (SSC),  Mississippi,  and  Michoud  Assembly  (MAF),  Louisiana.
SSC  is  NASA’s  premier  rocket  propulsion  testing  site.  The  Center  also  hosts  the
NASA  Shared  Services  Center  (NSSC)  and  a  number  of  other  federal  agencies  on
its  campus.  MAF,  near  New  Orleans,  is  NASA’s  manufacturing  site  for  the  Space
Shuttle  program  external  tanks.  NASA  estimated  that  initial  Katrina-related  re-
sponse and recovery costs through October, 2005 would be approximately $100 mil-
lion. NASA has established a Unique Project Number (UPN) within the Space Shut-
tle  budget,  to  record  and  track  all  expenditures.  In  the  September  Operating  Plan
update,  NASA  identified  $100  million  in  available  carryover  funds—$15  million
within  the  Shuttle  Life  Extension  Program  and  $85  million  within  International
Space  Station  Cargo/Crew  Services  funding—that  has  been  redirected  to  the  UPN
for  these  immediate  Katrina-related  costs.  On  October  28,  the  Administration  for-
warded  to  Congress  a  FY  2006  emergency  reallocation  and  rescission  request  that
includes  a  request  of  $324.8  million  to  support  NASA  Hurricane  Katrina  response
and recovery needs through at least May 31, 2006. The requested funds will be used
to  meet  recovery  needs  at  SSC  and  MAF  including:  repair  and  replacement  of  real
property,  Space  Shuttle  external  tanks  and  external  tank  support  equipment,  and
communications and IT infrastructure; environmental remediation; emergency oper-
ations (diesel fuel for power generators, debris removal, etc.); and, satellite and air-
craft imagery for evaluation of hurricane damage.
International Space Station (ISS) Status and Plans

Earlier this year, we established a team known as the Shuttle/Station Configura-
tion  Options  Team  (SSCOT)  to  evaluate  options  for  the  assembly  and  utilization  of
the ISS, taking into account the plan to retire the Space Shuttle by 2010 while hon-
oring US commitments to the Space Station International Partners. The Team also
considered  that  Space  Shuttle  flight  rate  planning  must  account  for  the  limitations
of the Shuttle that became apparent after the loss of Columbia, namely that NASA’s
ability  to  successfully  conduct  28  Shuttle  flights  by  2010  was  no  longer  technically
feasible.

The results of the study have been reviewed by the Space Operations Mission Di-
rectorate  and  other  NASA  offices,  and  we  have  initiated  discussions  with  the  ISS
International Partners.

• Key Elements of NASA’s Plan for Space Station:

NASA’s  proposed  plan,  subject  to  the  normal  budget  and  appropriation  proc-
ess, as well as ongoing return-to-flight considerations, is to fly the Shuttle in
a  disciplined,  measured  fashion,  and  to  retire  it  by  the  end  of  FY  2010.  The
flights  to  the  ISS  would  be  ordered  to  provide  the  necessary  infrastructure
for the International Partner modules first, followed immediately by the Part-
ner laboratories. Maintenance and logistic flights for sustainability are at the
end of the sequence. The order and flight strategy is as important a consider-
ation as the specific number of flights.
The  plan  includes  the  launch  of  key  NASA-provided  infrastructure  elements
and  other  capabilities  to  enable  a  potential  six  person  crew  and  meaningful
utilization of the ISS. NASA has determined, however, that its exploration re-

search  objectives  no  longer  require  the  Centrifuge  Accommodation  Module
that is being developed for NASA by JAXA under a barter arrangement.
This  proposed  approach  would  accommodate  almost  all  of  the  International
Partner  elements  currently  planned  for  launch  to  the  ISS,  with  the  notable
exception  of  the  Russian  Solar  Power  Module.  NASA  is  prepared  to  imme-
diately  engage  in  detailed  bilateral  discussions  to  establish  mutually  bene-
ficial arrangements to accommodate the proposed change.

NASA  senior  officials  have  been  meeting  with  our  key  International  Partners  to
discuss this approach, and the Partners have agreed to conduct a series of multilat-
eral  discussions  to  receive  and  assess  the  full  details  of  NASA’s  proposed  plan  and
the  Partners’  priorities  in  preparation  for  an  anticipated  Space  Station  Heads  of
Agency meeting in the January 2006 timeframe.

Recently, the Multilateral Coordination Board (MCB) convened to discuss the pro-
posed  configuration  and  assembly  sequence  and  tasked  the  Space  Station  Control
Board (SSCB) to assess the technical aspects of this new approach. The MCB is the
senior ISS management forum responsible for oversight of all ISS development, op-
erations  and  utilization  activities,  with  high-level  representation  from  NASA,  Rus-
sia,  Europe,  Japan  and  Canada.  Following  these  detailed  discussions,  the  partner-
ship will be ready to meet at the Heads of Agency level.
Aeronautics Research

Dr.  Lisa  Porter  was  recently  selected  as  Associate  Administrator  to  lead  NASA’s
Aeronautics  Research  Mission  Directorate.  In  that  role  she  has  begun  the  process
of reshaping NASA’s Aeronautics research program allowing the Agency to take re-
sponsibility for the intellectual stewardship of the core competencies of Aeronautics
for  the  Nation.  This  will  require  us  to  reinvest  in  the  Agency’s  in-house  expertise
to  ensure  that  we  retain  the  world-class  skills,  knowledge,  and  facilities  needed  to
guarantee  our  nation’s  ability  to  consistently  contribute  world-class  innovation  to
aeronautical challenges, both civilian and military.

The reshaped aeronautics program will strengthen our partnerships with the De-
partment of Defense (DOD) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), capitalizing
on  each  agency’s  unique  capabilities  and  resources  to  strengthen  the  Nation’s  lead-
ership in aeronautics. Our partnership with DOD will include close collaboration to
establish an integrated national strategy for management of the Nation’s most vital
wind  tunnels.  As  a  result,  NASA  and  DOD  will  work  cooperatively  to  consider  the
impact of any decisions regarding the management of each agency’s respective wind
tunnel  facilities.  We  will  forge  new  partnerships  and  continue  to  benefit  from  part-
nerships built in the past with academia and industry. Industry will be able to rely
on  us  to  invest  in  the  ‘‘seed  corn’’  that  is  the  critical  ingredient  in  revolutionary
technological advancement.

As  a  first  step,  NASA  is  reshaping  the  three  major  programs  within  the  Aero-
nautics  Mission  Directorate.  The  previous  Vehicle  Systems  Program  is  being  re-
named  the  Fundamental  Aeronautics  Program  in  order  to  reflect  properly  its  new
focus  on  fundamental  aeronautical  sciences.  Within  Fundamental  Aeronautics,  and
consistent  with  direction  we  received  from  the  Congress,  we  will  re-establish  the
Agency’s dedication to the mastery of core competencies in subsonic, supersonic, and
hypersonic  flight.  We  will  create  projects  that  provide  continual,  long-term  invest-
ment  in  the  fundamentals  and  that  build  upon  that  investment  to  develop  system-
level,  multi-disciplinary  capabilities  that  will  enable  both  the  civilian  and  military
communities to build platforms that meet their specific needs. As part of our invest-
ment  in  fundamental  aeronautics,  we  are  positioning  the  program  to  continue  im-
portant long-term research activity in FY 2006 that preserves the core competencies
in  rotorcraft  and  hypersonics,  drawing  upon  NASA’s  critical  in-house  expertise.  We
are transforming the Aviation Safety and Security Program into the Aviation Safety
Program,  where  we  will  focus  research  on  safety  areas  that  are  appropriate  to
NASA’s unique capabilities. Projects in Aviation Safety will address integrated vehi-

Leading  scientists  and  engineers  from  the  NASA  field  centers  participated  in
workshops  in  September  and  October  to  lay  the  foundation  for  a  technical  plan  to
reshape  the  Aeronautics  Research  program.  As  the  year  progresses,  this  technical
plan  will  be  guided  by  the  National  Aeronautics  Policy  that  is  being  developed  by
Office of Science and Technology Policy and NASA in collaboration with other agen-
cy partners. (Dr. Porter is co-chair of the National Science and Technology Council’s

search  Council  is  currently  conducting  a  decadal  survey  for  aeronautics,  which  will
also provide inputs to our plan.
Maintaining a Robust Science Portfolio

As  NASA  moves  forward  to  implement  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  science
will  remain  a  major  element  of  NASA’s  overall  portfolio.  During  the  past  year,  the
science  program  has  yielded  many  exciting  results.  The  Cassini  spacecraft  has  had
close encounters with a number of Saturn’s diverse moons and returned many excit-
ing  results,  including  images  of  the  mysteriously  sponge-like  cratered  moon
Hyperion.  Coordinated  observations  of  celestial  gamma  ray  bursts  by  four  NASA
spacecraft  and  ground-based  observatories  showed  that  these  brief  bursts  of  radi-
ation,  among  the  most  powerful  explosions  known,  are  emitted  when  a  black  hole
swallows a neutron star. Solar physicists used data from European and NASA space
observatories  to  improve  our  understanding  of  the  role  of  electric  currents  in  solar
flares,  which  can  disable  satellites  and  will  pose  a  threat  to  future  astronauts.  The
Deep  Impact  spacecraft  successfully  collided  with  Comet  Tempel  1  causing  a  mas-
sive explosion on the comet’s surface. The debris released by the force of this impact
will  be  used  by  scientists  to  study  the  formation  of  the  solar  system  and  the  struc-
ture  and  composition  of  comets.  The  Mars  Reconnaissance  Orbiter  was  successfully
launched  and  is  on  its  way  toward  a  March  2006  arrival.  On  a  more  urgent  note,
NASA teamed with other federal agencies and used its aircraft and satellite remote
sensing  systems  to  track  Hurricane  Katrina’s  winds  and  then  to  evaluate  the  dam-
age  and  flooding  caused  by  the  storm.  The  Hubble  Space  Telescope  was  used  to
search  for  oxygen-rich  minerals  on  the  Moon  that  might  be  useful  for  long-term
human  presence  there.  Our  science  program  will  continue  to  be  a  major  emphasis
of  the  Agency,  and  we  look  forward  to  comparable  future  results  from  the  science
portfolio.

To  continue  this  agenda  of  discovery,  the  science  budget  outlook  promises  a
healthy and vigorous program. The FY 2006 President’s budget showed a slight de-
crease  of  less  than  one  percent  in  the  budget  for  NASA’s  Science  Mission  Direc-
torate,  relative  to  the  FY  2005  budget,  but  this  was  attributable  to  adjustments  to
support  reducing  the  federal  deficit  and  other  National  priorities.  NASA’s  science
budget was not cut to serve the needs of the human exploration program.

Within the science program, NASA seeks to maintain a robust portfolio of invest-
ment  over  time  across  the  several  disciplines  in  the  Earth  and  space  sciences.  Be-
ginning with the baseline of existing programs and recent strategic planning, we set
future  directions  by  factoring  in  recent  scientific  progress,  Presidential  initiatives,
and  science  community  advice.  Beyond  these  broad  considerations,  choices  between
programs in a discipline can be driven by technology readiness and partnership op-
portunities that can leverage NASA’s investment.

As we continue to expand the frontier of scientific knowledge of the universe, how-
ever,  we  recognize  that  NASA  cannot  afford  to  take  advantage  of  all  deserving  op-
portunities.  In  making  choices  within  these  constraints,  we  recognize  the  need  to
change  the  emphasis  of  the  science  portfolio.  For  example,  it  had  been  planned  to
allocate,  in  FY  2006,  a  very  substantial  increase  in  funding  to  robotic  Mars  explo-
ration in future years. We have revisited these plans, and are adjusting our portfolio
to  increase  emphasis  on  Earth  and  solar  science  as  an  important  component  of  the
science  program.  The  value  of  Earth  science  and  applications  from  space  has  been
highlighted  during  the  recent  hurricanes  and  their  aftermath.  Some  of  the  re-allo-
cated resources are also targeted for urgent needs in the NASA astronomy program.
These  budget  adjustments  are  internal  to  the  science  program  and  will  not  affect
NASA’s proposed spending on exploration or aeronautics.

In  defining  and  executing  specific  science  program  activities,  the  prime  consider-
ation remains excellence. NASA will continue to look to the National Academies for
advice  on  scientific  priorities,  using,  for  example,  discipline  decadal  surveys.  These
are  now  available  in  all  of  the  areas  of  space  science  and  a  corresponding  major
Academy  study  is  currently  underway  for  Earth  science.  We  expect  the  latter  to  be
completed  in  fall  of  2006.  NASA  will  also  continue  the  practice  of  selecting  inves-
tigations  via  merit-based  peer  review  of  competitive  proposals  received  in  response
to open solicitations, and investigators at the NASA Centers will continue to be able
to compete against other investigators for support for their own research programs.
Looking  beyond  the  science  program  itself,  we  believe  that  the  Science  Mission
Directorate will play an important role in implementing the Vision. This exploration
program  is  not  premised  on  or  justified  exclusively  by  science,  but  we  expect  en-
hanced  opportunities  for  scientific  investigation  to  be  a  significant  aspect  of  it.  As
a result, we are working to establish the right interfaces and linkages between pro-

gram planning in the Science Mission Directorate and the Exploration Systems Mis-
sion Directorate.
NASA Workforce

Although the overall NASA budget has increased in recent years, the NASA work-
force  has  been  impacted  by  significant  budget  reductions  in  our  aeronautics  pro-
grams,  cancellation  of  programs,  and  investment  changes  to  the  research  and  tech-
nology portfolio of the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate. We have taken spe-
cific  actions  to  try  to  alleviate  this  problem.  For  example,  starting  in  November
2004, NASA implemented employee buyouts to rebalance the workforce and in Jan-
uary  2005  established  hiring  guidelines  to  emphasize  filling  vacancies  from  within
the  Agency.  We  are  also  making  significant  changes  that  will  help  ensure  that
NASA’s  Centers  have  a  productive  future.  Contractors  will  continue  to  play  a  key
role,  but  we  need  to  ensure  that  the  Federal  Government  maintains  the  in-house
intellectual  core  capacity  to  sustain  NASA’s  exploration,  science  and  aeronautics
missions.  Our  goal  is  to  ensure  that  NASA  Centers  are  productive  contributors  to
the Agency’s agenda and that we have the people and tools necessary to accomplish
the  long-term  goals  of  space  exploration.  With  that  in  mind,  we  will  be  making
changes at Headquarters as well.

In  September,  NASA  initiated  an  Institutional  Requirements  Review  (IRR)  the
scope  of  which  includes  corporate  G&A,  corporate  service  pools,  and  all  Head-
quarters-based  operations.  Our  goals  are  to  keep  corporately  funded  requirements
within  overall  corporate  budget  guidelines,  reduce  the  total  workforce  at  Head-
quarters commensurate with its appropriate role and overall size of the Agency, and
consolidate  required  personnel  at  the  Headquarters  building.  We  aim  to  (1)  gain
operational  efficiencies;  (2)  align  ourselves  to  a  management  model  that  has  Head-
quarters in charge of architecture, strategy, policy, compliance, and general manage-
ment  with  field  Centers  executing  programs  and  projects;  and  (3)  set  an  example
for the rest of the Agency of the willingness of Headquarters to make hard decisions
that benefit NASA in the long run.

Assuming  we  can  achieve  additional  buyouts  in  the  next  few  months,  NASA  has
approximately  950  civil  servants  in  the  field  that  are  not  currently  assigned  to
NASA programs in FY 2006. We will continue to address this problem and structure
the  workforce  to  ensure  the  success  of  the  exploration  vision,  as  well  as  NASA’s
other  missions  in  science,  aeronautics,  education,  space  operations  and  exploration.
However,  changes  to  our  skill  mix  and,  therefore,  the  workforce  will  be  required.
The  NASA  Office  of  Human  Capital  continues  to  work  with  center  management
on  the  workforce  strategies.  We  will  continue  to  identify  center  work  assignments
based on our strategic planning for the exploration systems. We are in the planning
stages of offering a final buyout program to employees.

If we are unable to cover all of the NASA civil service positions, NASA is planning
to conduct a Reduction in Force (RIF). Our Office of Human Capital is working with
human  resource  offices  at  the  centers  to  ensure  readiness  for  a  RIF,  should  it  be-
come necessary. However, a RIF is a last resort, and we will exhaust all other rea-
sonable possibilities before undertaking such an action.

With  changes  to  NASA’s  mission  it  is  important  that  we  manage  our  workforce
issues  to  ensure  that  we  have  the  right  skill  mix  to  successfully  execute  the  vision
for  space  exploration  and  maintain  the  important  work  in  other  areas  such  as  our
aeronautics,  space  operations  and  science  portfolios.  We  will  have  an  integrated,
Agency-wide approach to human capital management.
NASA Authorization Bill for 2005

The  House  and  Senate  have  passed  two  differing  versions  of  the  National  Aero-
nautics  and  Space  Administration  Authorization  Act  of  2005  (H.R.  3070  and  S.
1281),  and  we  understand  that  conferees  may  meet  soon  to  resolve  the  differences
between the two versions. We will soon be sending the Committee a letter outlining
NASA’s  views  with  respect  to  the  bills  for  Members’  consideration  during  this  con-
ference.

NASA  applauds  both  bills’  endorsement  of  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  and
the  incorporation  of  a  number  of  the  legislative  provisions  the  Administration  in-
cluded  in  the  proposed  NASA  authorization  bill  submitted  to  Congress.  Both  bills
provide  many  of  the  policies  and  tools  necessary  to  achieve  the  fundamental  goal
of  the  Vision,  i.e.,  the  advancement  of  U.S.  scientific,  security,  and  economic  inter-
ests  through  a  robust  space  exploration  program.  While  we  find  much  to  support
in  both  bills,  we  continue  to  have  serious  concerns  regarding  several  provisions  in
each  bill  that  need  to  be  satisfactorily  addressed  prior  to  final  enactment  of  reau-
thorization  legislation,  and  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Committee  to  resolve
these issues.

Conclusion

39

In  the  months  ahead,  I  am  confident  that  we  will  achieve  steady  progress  in
reaching  our  exploration  objectives—one  mission,  one  voyage,  and  one  landing  at  a
time.  I  am  convinced  that  in  the  ways  we  are  attacking  the  challenges  presented
by  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  we  are  setting  the  stage  for  a  space  program
that will increase our opportunities to advance scientific knowledge and expand our
horizons.

Once  again,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today.  Mr.  Chairman,  and

Members of the Committee, I would be pleased to respond to any questions.

DISCUSSION

CEV ACCELERATION

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Administrator.
Well, the challenges that have—you know, I am reminded of, you
know,  the  Academy  Award  winning  actor  who  uttered  the  famous
lines:  ‘‘Show  me  the  money.’’  I  think  if  all  of  us  who  expect  you  to
put—pull  the  rabbit  out  of  the  hat  and  we  are  able  to  give  you  a
path  to  the  money  you  wanted,  I  am  confident  you  could  use  it
wisely and accomplish everything we want, but I don’t know where
the hat is, let alone the rabbit. And I do know the money is a chal-
lenge.

So  I  ask  you  this.  What  are  the  consequences  if  we  start  down
a path to accelerate CEV and then find out that we don’t have the
money  in  fiscal  year  2008  to  remain  on  that  path?  Are  we  worse
off than if we just set 2014 as the date today? And parenthetically,
just  let  me  say,  I  think  CEV  acceleration  would  be  great,  but  only
if it doesn’t eat into other vital programs that I also think are very
great.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Clearly,  the  best  thing  to  do  for  any  program  is  to
pick  a  date  that  is  achievable  and  to  provide  the  funding  as  it  is
required in the different phases of the program consistent with the
overall  ceiling  that  is  provided.  We  believe  we  have  budgeted  ade-
quately  for  the  CEV.  We  believe  that  if  the  President’s  budget  is
approved,  that  it  can  be  delivered  in  2012.  We  believe  that  if  it  is
delayed  further,  we  risk  losing  critical  competencies  between  the
end  of  Shuttle  retirement  and  the  onset  of  operations  of  the  CEV.
We  also  risk  taking  America  out  of  manned  space  flight  for  four
critical years following the completion of Station assembly at a pe-
riod  of  time  when  the  programs  of  other  nations  are  in  their  as-
cendancy.

I  believe  this  to  be  strategically  the  wrong  thing  to  do,  and  so
I  have  stated  that  replacing  the  Shuttle  with  an  equivalent  capa-
bility through the use of the CEV as soon as possible after Shuttle
retirement  is  our  real  highest  priority.  And  if  other  adjustments
need  to  be  made  to  respect  that  priority,  I  would  respectfully  rec-
ommend that those adjustments be made.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  We  don’t  now  have  the  money  in  the  pro-
jections  ahead  to  pay  for  Shuttle’s  CEV  acceleration,  so  what  hap-
pens if we get started on CEV and have to slow it down? What are
the consequences of that?

Dr. GRIFFIN. If we start on CEV at a certain pace and then have
to  slow  it  down,  we  will  become  less  efficient  in  that  program  and
will—absolutely will cause it to overrun.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  So  get  back  to  the  basic  question.  If—are
we  being  too  ambitious  right  now  in  setting  the  2012  date,  given
the  circumstances  that  exist  that  I  think  we  all  agree  are  there?
Dr. GRIFFIN. Sir, I think that our plan is sound. I think our plan
for  CEV  development  includes  adequate  cost  reserves  against  un-
knowns.  We  are  working  to  understand  and  contain  Shuttle  costs,
and  we  propose  maintaining  a  robust  program  of  space  science
while we complete this CEV. All plans have uncertainty.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, I understand that, but——

Dr. GRIFFIN. And we have advanced to you the best plan that we

have been able to craft.

STAFFORD-COVEY MINORITY REPORT

Chairman BOEHLERT. The Stafford-Covey Report, and I have had
some  discussion  with  you  outside  of  the  Committee  hearing  room
on  this.  The  Stafford-Covey  Report  included  several  minority  re-
ports.  And  one  minority  report  stated  that  NASA  has  not  yet
learned the lessons of the past. And I know you examined that mi-
nority report very carefully and have been addressing that in your
public statements. Do you agree with the conclusions of that minor-
ity  report  specifically?  And  are  there  observations  in  the  minority
report  that  you  don’t  agree  with?  And  the  changes  you  have  made
in the personnel, do you think that would satisfy those who were—
identify  with  the  minority  report  that  you  get  it  and  you  are  now
moving  in  a  direction,  on  a  course  that  they  think  is  prudent  for
you to follow?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  There  are  many  questions  there.  I  will  try  to  an-

swer them. Remind me if I fail.

I  read—I  believe,  the  particular  minority  report  you  are  talking
about  is  the  19-page  report  by  authors  Dan  Crippen  and  Chuck
Daniel and——

Chairman BOEHLERT. That is exactly right, sir.
Dr.  GRIFFIN.—several  others.  These  are  people  whom,  by  and
large,  I  know  and  respect.  I  read  their  report  very  carefully  with
yellow  highlighters  and  underlined  marks  and  also  conveyed  the
report  to  others  whom  I  deeply  respect  and  asked  for  their  com-
ments.  When  I  had  done  all  of  those  things,  I  found  that,  while  I
could  not  agree  with  each  and  every  specific  remark  in  the  report,
broadly speaking, I did believe that it was correct. It rang true are
the  words  that  I  would  say.  And  others  agreed  with  me.  It  rang
true.

Accordingly,  I  discussed  it  in  detail  with  our  new  AA  for  Space
Operations, Bill Gerstenmaier. Bill also felt that, broadly speaking,
the report rang true. We have shredded that report out into—there
are  much  pros  and  then  there  are  many  actionable  specifics.  We
have  shredded  out  the  actionable  specifics,  and  we  have  put  to-
gether—we  are  putting  together,  I  should  say,  a  plan  to  deal  with
those. And when we have that ongoing, we will be happy to review
that with you or with your staff.

Separately,  I  have  chartered  a  team,  a  separate  independent
team,  much  like  the  Exploration  Systems  Architecture  team  that
you discussed earlier today, to look at NASA safety and mission as-
surance  from  the  broadest  possible  perspective  and  across  the  en-
tire agency. This special team is being run out of our program anal-
ysis and evaluation directorate. They will report directly to me, and
they  will  take  a  look,  and  again  in  the  broadest  possible  sense,
about  what  it  means  to  have  safety  and  mission  assurance  at
NASA.

And  so  those—that  is  the  two-pronged  attack  I  have  on  the

issues raised by the minority report.

I  would  also  say  that,  in  some  cases  where  particular  friends  of
mine on—who authored that report have been contacted, that they
have been very positive. I don’t want to put words in other people’s

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:19 May 22, 2006 Jkt 024151 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\110305\24151 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

42

mouths,  because  I  have  had  that  done  to  me  and  don’t  appreciate
it,  but  broadly  speaking,  I  would  say  the  people  I  have  talked  to
on  the  minority  Committee  strongly  approve  of  the  people  that  we
have  put  in  place  in  running  the  mission  directorates  at  NASA.  I
hope that that will continue.

Culture  change  takes  a  long  time.  When  we  lost  Challenger,
there  were  management  culture  issues  in  play.  When  we  lost  Co-
lumbia  17  years  later,  there  were  management  culture  issues  in
play, and in some cases, they were the same issues. I have, in fact,
reorganized the engineering and programmatic structure of how we
do  business  in  NASA  in  order  to  obtain  the  kind  of  independent,
technical, authoritative excellence that we want. I have made tech-
nical  excellence  proven  in  the  field  a  non-negotiable  criteria  for
having  a  high-level  management  position  in  NASA  from  this  day
forward.

I believe that these changes, although they need time to take ef-
fect,  when,  and  as  they  take  effect,  will  bring  us  the  kind  of  Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Administration that you and I and all
of us want to see.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  I  will  honor  your  request,  Mr.  Adminis-
trator; I will no longer use baseball analogies. You just birdied that
one.

Dr. GRIFFIN. Thank you, sir.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Gordon.
Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

SERVICING OF THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE

Dr.  Griffin,  listening  to  your  testimony,  I  have  a  couple  of

quick—one thought and one question.

I—your—the  comment  that  the  CEV,  that  you  were  prepared  to
do whatever it takes to get it up and going, I think, is a dire warn-
ing to the rest of NASA. I am concerned about that, but I—let that
warning, I guess, go out to everyone.

The  question,  also  in  your  testimony,  I—well,  I  thought  it—the
servicing of the Hubble was pretty much a done deal, but you said
that  was  still  in  play.  Is  that  still  in  play  whether  you  are  going
to  do  it  or  not  because  of  budgetary  reasons,  or  because  there  are
still some questions as to the mechanics of the ability to do the job?
Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Let  me  answer  the  second  question  first.  The
Hubble  decision,  I  have  not  changed  my  thoughts  or  my  wording
on  that  since  the  day  of  my  confirmation  hearing.  If  NASA  can
technically  perform  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission  to  Hubble,  it  will
be done.

Mr. GORDON. Okay. So it is a high priority then?
Dr. GRIFFIN. Right. It is——
Mr. GORDON. Okay.
Dr.  GRIFFIN.—the  highest—frankly,  it  is  my  highest  priority  for

the Shuttle program.

Mr. GORDON. Good. I just misunderstood that.
And when do you think you will make a decision on the technical

aspect of that?

Dr. GRIFFIN. I have already said, we needed the second—we need
the two return-to-flight missions, because, following the loss of Co-
lumbia  and  the  return-to-flight  sequence,  we  have  new  entire  con-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:19 May 22, 2006 Jkt 024151 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\110305\24151 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

straints  on  usage  of  EDA  time,  because  some  of  it  may  need  to  be
preserved  for  inspections  and  repairs,  like  we  did  on  the  last  mis-
sion.  We  need  to  understand  the  full  operating  profile  to  know  if
we have time in the mission sequence——

Mr. GORDON. Okay.
Dr. GRIFFIN.—to perform an effective——
Mr.  GORDON.  Thank  you.  I  want  to  move  on,  but  thank  you,  sir.
Dr. GRIFFIN. Thank you.
Mr. GORDON. So we are still in sync, thanks.
Dr. GRIFFIN. Yes, we are.
Mr. GORDON. Dr. Griffin, I would also like to follow-up with some

more questions regarding your current budgetary situation.

BUDGET SHORTFALL

The  fiscal  year  2006  budget  request  that  NASA  submitted  to
Congress included a five-year budgetary run-out through fiscal year
2010. As of now, how much are you short relative to what you will
need through fiscal year 2010?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  I  am  not  trying  to  evade  your  question.  I  am  not

sure I understand—I am not sure I fully understand it.

The 2006 budget request had a run-out through 2010——
Mr. GORDON. Yes.
Dr. GRIFFIN.—through fiscal year 2010.
Mr. GORDON. And it is my understanding that to do what you are
proposing  to  do,  you  are  going  to  be,  as  I  think—well,  our  Chair-
man  earlier  said  he  thought  it  was  in  the  $6  billion  range.  A  con-
servative estimate is $3 billion——

Dr. GRIFFIN. I understand your question.
Mr. GORDON. So what is your opinion as to that shortfall?
Dr. GRIFFIN. Relative to the 2006 budget request, we are, I would
say,  several  billion  dollars  short  in  the  Shuttle  operations  line.  I
would  remind  the  Committee  that  the  out-years  projections  for
Shuttle operations costs, when they were made, at the time, a cou-
ple of years ago now, were labeled as placeholders, that we did not
fully  understand—on  the  Administration  side,  we  did  not  fully  un-
derstand  what  it  was  going  to  take  to  retire  the  Shuttle  in  a  dis-
ciplined and orderly and effective way in 2010. We have now looked
at  that  over  the  summer  as  part  of  the  Shuttle  Station  operations
exercise.  We  believe  we  understand  that.  And  it  is  several  billion
dollars.

Mr. GORDON. Would it be fair to say in the $3 billion to $6 billion

range? Is that——

Dr. GRIFFIN. I would say the $3 billion to $5 billion range.
Mr. GORDON. $3 billion to $5 billion range. Okay.
Dr.  GRIFFIN.  And  now  let  me  also  add,  we  are—that  is  an  esti-
mate. We are not just taking that as a for granted. We are not tak-
ing it as a given. We are scrubbing the program hard. We are doing
that  today.  We  were  doing  it  yesterday.  We  will  be  doing  it  next
week.  We  are  looking  for  savings  in  the  Shuttle  program,  because
as  we  retire  the  Shuttle,  of  course  we  want  to  put  as  much  money
as  necessary  to  operate  it  safely  but  no  more.  But  where  we  are
today in comparison to our run-out, as projected in the 2006 budget
that you mentioned, we are a few billion dollars down.

Mr.  GORDON.  And  then  if  I  could  follow  up,  and  I  do  have  some
questions  on  that,  are  the  components—or  could  you  tell  us  what
are the components of the shortfall? Does it assume an accelerated
CEV  delivery  by  2012?  And  does  it  assume  that  NASA  will  essen-
tially  complete  the  assemblage  of  the  Space  Station  by  means  of
another  18  Shuttle  flights?  And  how  much  of  the  budget  shortfall
can  be  allocated  to  the  Shuttle  program?  And  finally,  with  respect
to the Shuttle, is it accurate to say that the fiscal year 2006 budget
request  prepared  by  OMB  and  NASA  assumed  productions  in  the
Shuttle  fiscal  year  2008  to  fiscal  year  2010  funding  requirement
that did not have an analytical justification?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Again, sir, the 2008, 2009, and 2010 run-out for the
Shuttle—we  are  okay  in  2006  and  2007,  as  best  as  we  understand
it.  The  2008,  2009,  and  2010  numbers  were,  at  that  time,  labeled
as  placeholders.  We  now  have  an  analytical  basis  for  that  that  we
did not have at that time.

Mr.  GORDON.  Okay.  Can  you  provide  that  to  us  for  the  record,
because we don’t have that? You don’t have to do it right now, but
I mean, will you——
Dr. GRIFFIN. Okay.
Mr. GORDON.—provide—or have your staff provide that to us?
Dr. GRIFFIN. Well, that——
Mr. GORDON. That analytic——
Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Those  projections  currently  are  part  of  our  fiscal
year  2007  budget  formulation  and,  as  such,  are  presently  embar-
goed.  So  we  will  provide  you  what  we  can  as  soon  as  we  possibly
can, but——

Mr. GORDON. Well, again, I am not asking for 2007, and I under-
stand  the  embargo,  but  rather  the  analysis  for  the  2008  to
2010——

Dr. GRIFFIN. Let me take your question for the record——
Mr. GORDON. Okay.
Dr. GRIFFIN.—and we will get back to you as soon——
Mr. GORDON. Good.
Dr. GRIFFIN.—as we possibly can.
Mr. GORDON. Okay. That is fine.
Dr. GRIFFIN. And I forgot your other questions.
Mr. GORDON. What are the components of the shortfall?
Dr. GRIFFIN. The components——
Mr. GORDON. Assuming an accelerated CEV delivery by 2012.
Dr.  GRIFFIN.  The  shortfall  is  entirely  within  the  Shuttle  oper-
ations  line.  The  exploration  line  in  which  the  CEV  is  being  devel-
oped  closes.  The  exploration  architecture  was  developed  subject  to
the  constraint  that  the  budget  must  close  within  that  line.  The
science  budget  line  closes  and  aeronautics  closes.  So  the  shortfall
of which you speak is entirely in the Shuttle line.

Mr.  GORDON.  We  have  a  lot  of  folks  interested  today,  so  I  will

conclude my, at least, initial round now.

Mr. CALVERT. [Presiding] I thank the gentleman.

COMMERCIAL CREW AND CARGO

Dr. Griffin, the—as you know, the House just recently passed the
Iranian Nonproliferation Act, as you mentioned earlier in your tes-
timony,  and  it  is—hopefully  it  will  pass  in  the  Senate.  And  hope-

fully, this dissipation by the Russians will continue until 2016. Ob-
viously we didn’t want to be there, but the Russians are in the crit-
ical path at this point. We need them in order to continue our mis-
sion to the International Space Station. But how soon do you really
think  we  can  get—or  move  away  from  our  reliance  on  Russia  and
grow a United States industry in crew transportation and cargo re-
supply  for  the  International  Space  Station.  Do  you  think  it  is  rea-
sonable to expect something in the reasonable future? You probably
understand that technology on that better than anybody.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Yes,  sir,  I  do  think  it  is  feasible,  and  to  that  end,
NASA  has  two  initiatives  in—one  much  larger  than  the  other,  in
space flight over the coming years. The first that we have discussed
maybe  more  than  some  of  you  want  to  is  the  CEV  and  trying  to
bring  that  online  by  2012.  And  that  system  does  have  the  capa-
bility.  It  is  primarily  designed  to  go  to  the  Moon,  but  as  with  the
Apollo and Skylab capability, it has a leave-behind or a residual ca-
pability to service the Station.

Our  preferred  outcome,  however,  for  servicing  the  Station  is  to
obtain  crew—well,  initially  cargo  supply  and  later  crew  rotation
services  through  more  arms-length  commercial  transactions.  To
that end, we will be subsidizing over the next—the five years of the
budget run-out approximately a half-billion-dollar commercial cargo
crew re-supply capability. I do believe that that kind of a financial
incentive  for  purely  commercial  industry,  not  developed  on  a  gov-
ernment  prime  contractor  relationship  will  be  sufficient  to  allow
substantial providers to emerge.

Mr.  CALVERT.  Do  you  have  any  guesses  as  far  as  to  how  soon

that can be done? Two years? Five years?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  All  entrepreneurs  will  tell  you  that  if  we  just  give
them the money, they can have it the day after tomorrow. My hon-
est  technical  estimate  would  be  that  their  time  frame  will  not  be
substantially  quicker  than  the  government  CEV  time  frame,  but
that  if  they  are  successful,  it  will  be  at  greatly  reduced  cost.  So  I
would  anticipate  four  or  five  years.  I  hope  that  industry,  if  put  to
the test, can do better, but I do not expect it.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Mr.  CALVERT.  You  mentioned,  also,  we  had  a  hearing  last  week,
a  joint  hearing  with  Government  Reform  relating  to  the  financial
management  at  NASA.  And  your  CFO  Gwen  Sykes  was  present,
and  I  asked  her  a  question,  if  NASA  were  held  to  the  same  rig-
orous  accounting  requirement  that  U.S.  corporations  face  under
Sarbanes-Oxley, would you, as NASA’s CFO, sign off on the annual
fiscal report, and her response was no. So I guess with that, when
do you think that NASA will have its fiscal house in order to meet
the same standards that we, in Congress, are requiring of corporate
America?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  I—first  of  all,  let  me  say  I  strongly  endorse  the  re-
quirement  that  NASA  be  able  to  account  for  its  funds  at  least  as
well  as  its  contractors  be  required  to  do  and  am,  you  know,  ap-
palled,  as  with  all  of  you,  that  we  find  ourselves  in  this  situation.
I have made it a priority since coming on board, and we have made
progress. We have made progress, as measured by independent ad-
visory  teams  to  include  one  which  is  led  by  the  Comptroller  of  the

46

OMB.  We  have  made  progress.  We  are  not  there  yet.  We  will—I
have already been advised before they even did the audit, that our
auditing  firm  will—we  will  still  be  red  this  year.  So  they  haven’t
yet  done  the  audit,  and  they  know  that  we  are  red.  So  it  will  not
be  this  year.  I  hope  that  by  2008  we  will  be  in  good  shape.  That
is my plan.

We  are—we—I  will  record  a  certain  amount  of  progress  which
has  been  made.  I  believe  I  have  passed  out  to  your  staff  this  par-
ticular sheet, which shows that in June, in one of, I think, nine cat-
egories, counting here eight categories of financial management, we
were red in two and yellow in four and green in only three. In July,
we were red in one, yellow in four, and green in four. And today—
well,  as  of  August,  we  had  no  reds,  three  yellows,  and  the  rest
green. We are making progress. We really are. We are taking it se-
riously.  We  have  added  resources  that  I  would  rather  spend  on
space  craft,  but  first,  we  have  to  get  our  financial  house  in  order.
We  have  responded  to  the  45  recommendations  from  the  GAO.
We have closed only three, but 19 are significantly on their way to
closure,  and  we  are  responding  to  the  balance.  The  remaining  23
we will respond to.

Outside  advisors  have  said  that  our  strategy  is  correct,  the  plan
is correct. We just need to stay on course, and that is what we are
going to do.

Mr. CALVERT. I appreciate that.
Next,  I  recognize  the  gentleman  who  is  rarely  in  the  rough,  the

Ranking Member, Mr. Udall.

Mr. UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
It depends on the day of the week, frankly, whether I am in the

rough or not.

SMALL BUSINESSES AND UNIVERSITIES

Administrator,  let  me  again—great  to  have  you  here.  I  want  to
thank  you  before  I  direct  a  couple  of  questions  at  you  in  regards
to  the  exploration  architecture  and  some  of  the  impacts  on  small
business  and  universities.  I  commend  your  focus  on  Hubble.  We
have  had  conversations  along  these  lines,  and  it  is  such  a  tremen-
dous  asset  for  NASA,  for  the  country.  And  as  we  have  discussed,
the  man  on  the  street,  the  woman  on  the  street  know  about
Hubble, and there is such potential here across the board. So thank
you for your attention to it and commitment to it.

We  are  talking  about  the  exploration  architecture  and  several
contractors,  small  businesses  and  universities  this  week  received
notice  that  their  systems  research  and  technology  contracts  had
been  terminated  effective  immediately.  And  specifically,  I  am
aware  of  three  contracts  in  my  District  that  total  nearly  $12  mil-
lion that have been placed in that status just in the last week. And
I  am  sure  that  my  District  is  not  the  only  one  that  has  been  hit
hard by these cuts.

And so in that spirit of looking across the board, I want to direct

a couple of questions to you.

You  stated  you  want  to  strengthen  your  partnerships  with  uni-
versities, but the claim NASA is making is that the termination of
these projects is necessary to allow for new technology development
in  NASA  Centers,  not  in  the  universities  themselves.  And  of

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:19 May 22, 2006 Jkt 024151 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\110305\24151 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

47

course,  you  have  put  forth  the  point  of  view  that  the  Moon  Mars
initiative  will  not  come  at  the  expense  of  important  science
projects, yet I believe I can identify at least one terminated project
in  my  District  as  performing  fundamental  life  science  research
under  human  research  and  technology  that  happens  to  be  useful
for  exploration  as  well.  How  do  you  explain  the  contrasting  prior-
ities?  And  what  are  NASA’s  plans  under  the  exploration  architec-
ture  to  strengthen  its  work  with  universities  and  ensure  that  this
initiative  doesn’t  come  at  the  expense  of  science  programs,  a  ques-
tion you have heard before but, nonetheless, a very, very important
question?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Let me try to do my best.
We had, earlier on, before—for some reason, before we had devel-
oped an exploration architecture, we, at NASA, had put out a very
broad—we  cast  a  net  very  widely  on  our  research  and  technology
program, unfortunately, leading many firms and many researchers
to believe that we could sustain all of those. In fact, the technology
development and the research that we should be conducting should
be  oriented  toward,  in  an  appropriately  timed  phase  way,  those
projects  which  we  are  actually  doing.  So  when  we  finished  devel-
oping  the  architecture,  which  the  Chairman  has  very  kindly
praised  for  its  efficiency,  part  of  that  efficiency  means  that  we
should  limit  our  research  and  technology  efforts  to  those  things
which  support  the  requirements  of  that  architecture.  And  that  re-
quired  canceling  a  number  of  things  which  we  either  did  not  need
or  did  not  need  right  now,  given  our  overall  funding  priorities  as
a Nation.

Now I have run, for the Defense Department, a very large, multi-
billion-dollar technology program in the past. It is fun. I would love
nothing more than to have within NASA the kind of money to run
a broadly-based technology program. But given our—the many pri-
orities we have in this Nation, and the priorities that the Adminis-
tration  has  for  domestic  discretionary  funding,  we,  simply,  in
NASA,  are  not,  at  this  time,  able  to  run  that  kind  of  a  broadly-
based  technology  program,  and  so  we  have  winnowed  the  field  to
those things that we believe we can afford.

With  regard  to  science,  when  I  speak  of  science,  I  am  speaking
of the science being done in the science mission directorate, broadly
speaking space, Earth, and planetary sciences and astronomy. And
the human life science research of which you spoke is there to sup-
port  human  exploration.  It  seemed,  to  me,  that  it  was  getting  the
cart  before  the  horse  to  be  worrying  about  money  for  human  or
other  life  sciences  when  we  could  not  assure  ourselves  the  contin-
ued  capability  to  be  able  to  place  people  in  orbit  in  the  first  place.
So my priority became assuring that the United States would have
as  close  to  continuous  capability  to  put  people  in  space  first  and
then conducting the research on them after that.

Mr.  UDALL.  As  I  mentioned,  I  think  this  is  a  fairness  question,
and  it  cuts  across  the  country,  and  I  don’t  think  that  my  District
is alone in suffering some of these proposed cuts.

What  can  we  do  to  help  these  universities  and  businesses  now
that have been stranded? And do you have plans in the future to—
in  regard  to  this  situation  we  face  right  now  if  those  situations
arise in the future?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  For  the  next  several  years,  I  have  tried  to  be  very
honest  with  the  university  department  chairs  and  presidents  who
have  contacted  me,  and  in  fact,  including  one  in  your  District.  I
have  tried  to  be  honest  with  them.  For  the  next  several  years,  our
resources that we can devote to Space Station will be utilized to as-
semble Space Station. And the focus on utilization of it for the next
several years for research or technology or any other purposes will
have  to  be  minimized  in  favor  of  the  priority  of  first  getting  it  as-
sembled. The priority after that, in keeping with the President’s vi-
sion,  is  to  provide  a  reliable,  robust,  sustainable  successor  to  the
Space  Shuttle.  And  when  we  have  those  two  components  in  place,
a completed Space Station and a successor to the Shuttle, then we
can begin to focus more heavily on utilizing the Space Station. But
that will be several years in the future.

Chairman BOEHLERT. The gentleman’s time has expired.
Mr. Rohrabacher.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
I want to say hello to my old friend, Mike, and——
Dr. GRIFFIN. Hello, sir. Thank you.

AMENDMENTS TO IRAN NONPROLIFERATION ACT

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  All  right.  I  would  like  to,  first  and  foremost,
introduce  to  you,  Mike,  and  to  other  Members  of  our  committee,
Mr.  Koslovski,  who  is  a  member  of  Parliament  from  Russia,  and
joining us today, who is engaged in a meeting downstairs with the
International Relations Committee. And I asked him to join us, be-
cause  some  of  the  questions  that  I  had  asked  today  will  deal  di-
rectly with Russian American space cooperation.

And  to  that  end,  I  would  like  to  ask  you,  Mike,  about  whether
or not the legislation that we just passed through Congress will, in-
deed, permit us to have the type of cooperation we need with Rus-
sia,  the  amendments  that  we  made  to  the  Iran  Nonproliferation
Act,  that  will  enable  us  to  maximize  our  benefit  of  the  Space  Sta-
tion, or is there something more that is going to be needed and why
that is important.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  I  believe  the  legislation  that  you  have  passed  will
allow  us  to  do  what  we  need  to  do  with  Russia  to  continue  our  co-
operation  with  them  in  the  Station  program.  I  think  we  are  fine.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay. So mission accomplished, as far as our

end of it?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Yes. Yes, sir.

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Okay.  That  is  short-term.  The  short-term
was making sure that we could handle our obligations and—to the
International  Space  Station  Coalition  in  cooperation  with  the  Rus-
sians and that we didn’t find ourselves in a situation where Ameri-
cans  weren’t  going  to  be  on  a  Space  Station  that  we  ended—that
we paid for. That was the short-term.

In the long-term, I note that China and Russia are now entering
into  an  agreement  on  space  cooperation,  perhaps  an  agreement
that  will  result  in  Moon  missions  by  the  Chinese  in  cooperation
with  the  Russians  to  the  Moon.  Doesn’t  this  indicate—and  doesn’t

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:19 May 22, 2006 Jkt 024151 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\110305\24151 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

49

the fact that Russia went with—to Iran to do business indicate that
since the downfall of communism in Russia, that we have not been
engaged with Russia at a high enough level and it—and an intense
enough  level  to  prevent  them  from  going  into  directions  that  are
contrary to our national interests?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Well,  that  may  be  so.  I  don’t  believe  it  is  up  to  me
to define our national interests, but I will observe that other space-
faring  nations  of  the  world,  while  not  having  the  discretionary  re-
sources that we have to bring to bear on the subject, are very inter-
ested  in  the  development,  exploration,  and  the  exploitation  of
space.  And  if  we  choose  to  lead  the  Space  Station  program,  it  pro-
vides ample evidence that we can lead and that we can form coali-
tions  of  nations  to  do  great  things  in  space.  We  can  form  partner-
ships  and  alliances.  And  heaven  knows  the  United  States  would
rather  have  partners  and  alliances  than  enemies  and  adversaries.
If  we  step  away  from  a  leadership  role,  if  we  are  not  willing  to
pledge  the  commitment,  the  resources,  and  the  cooperation  to  as-
sume a leading role in space, then others will fill that vacuum. And
I think that is what you are observing. And I think it is incumbent
upon us—as I said in my opening statement, Americans are a fron-
tier society, and where there is a frontier, Americans must lead.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. But to achieve that goal—this is a very costly
goal  that  we  are  talking  about.  Anything  we  do  in  space  is  very
costly,  especially  dealing  with  space  transportation,  which  you  are
trying  to  make  up  for  right  now  with  your  plan.  Won’t  Russia—
isn’t  a  cooperative  effort  with  Russia  vitally  important  for  us  to
meet our own potential, because it brings down the cost?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Well, surely. And Russia has been an excellent part-
ner.  They  have  stepped  up  to  the  plate,  as—to  refer  to  a  baseball
analogy, they have stepped up to the plate on the Space Station in
providing  critical  crew  and  cargo  transportation  services  in  the
time that the Space Shuttle has been down.

All of that said, even a—even as significant a space-faring nation
as Russia does not, at present, nor in the nearly foreseeable future,
have the capability to provide the kind of heavy-lift, crew and cargo
supply  that  the  United  States  had  been  doing,  can  do,  expects  to
do in the future, and must do, if it is to be done at all.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that we keep
an eye on the plans of what we—you know, our long-term plans in
space and that if we are duplicating—if we are trying to build tech-
nology  that  duplicates  what  Russia  can  already  do,  that  that  is  a
waste  of  resources  and  actually  a  deterrent  to  the  type  of  coopera-
tion that will serve both of our countries and that we should utilize
those  resources—those  things  that  Russia  can  provide  to  save
money for us and use that money to develop new technologies that
neither country has.

Dr. GRIFFIN. We are not duplicating capability.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay.
Dr.  GRIFFIN.  And  a  certain  amount  of  parallel  capability  and—
offers a redundancy. When one is a committed space-faring nation,
we  need  a  certain  amount  of  redundancy,  because,  as  you  have
seen,  we  can  have  accidents.  They  have  had  accidents  in  the  past.
If  we  are  single-string  on  our  access  to  space,  we  are  going  to  be
in trouble.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. The gentleman’s time has expired.
I would point out to the gentleman that we are constantly work-
ing  with  the  Administrator  toward  the  objectives  that  you  have
outlined.  We  want  to  continue  to  promote  international  coopera-
tion,  but  we  want  to  minimize  dependence  on  others  for  our  core
missions and capabilities.

With that, the gentleman, Mr. Honda, you are recognized.
Mr. HONDA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I welcome Administrator Griffin for being here.
Let me just cut real quickly to the chase.

CENTRIFUGE ACCOMMODATION MODULE

It  feels  like  we  are  interrogating  the  Administrator  for  a  situa-
tion that he had nothing to do with, but he has come in at a point
where  we  needed  him  to  sort  of  fix  things  and  realign  our  projects
based upon science rather than based upon the bottom line. I think
that was the reason why I was—you needed to have him as Admin-
istrator.

And  Mr.  Administrator,  I  think  that  we  have  to  accept  the  idea
that it is not your budget. You didn’t create the budget. You didn’t
create  the  allegation—or  the  appropriations.  We  did.  And  this  Ad-
ministration did. So you know, to my colleagues, if we are going to
be pointing fingers, we have to look at the Administration and how
we  appropriated  money  to  this  program  over  the  years.  That  is
number one.

I think that President Kennedy didn’t take this kind of approach
when he challenged our Nation to put a man on the Moon. In fact,
he  noted,  and  I  quote:  ‘‘The  facts  of  the  matter  are  that  we  have
never  made  the  national  decisions  or  martial  and  national  re-
sources required for such leadership. We have never specified long-
range goals on an urgent time schedule and managed our resources
and  our  time  source  to  ensure  their  fulfillment.’’  Kennedy  under-
stood that to get to the Moon, we needed to specify long-range goals
and  commit  the  resources  that  would  be  needed  to  achieve  them.
And he recognized that. And I quote: ‘‘If we are to go only halfway
or reduce our size in the face of difficulty, in my judgment, it would
be better not to go at all.’’

I  think  this  is  worthwhile  going  forward,  and  I  think  that  we
ought  to  put  the  resources  out  there.  If  we  are  saying,  ‘‘Show  me
the money,’’ then we have to show him the money so he can do the
work  that  he  needs  to  do.  And  our  plan,  as  our  colleague  said  on
the other side, to meet our potential and to ask—to raise the ques-
tion  about  relationship  with  other  countries,  how  do  we  expect  to
get  international  partners  to  work  with  us  on  going  to  the  Moon
and Mars when we have broken our own agreements with them on
the ISS? From what I hear, the Europeans and Japanese research-
ers are quite upset and do not intend to do any more collaboration
with  us  due  to  the  fact  that  we  are  throwing  away  billions  of  dol-
lars they invested and 20 years of work by scientists and engineers.
Why should they ever want to work with us again?

I  think  we  ought  to  keep  our  word  and  our  agreements  and  our
treaties and also create more relationships with countries like Rus-

sia and China so that we can get there as global communities and
make sure that we do this.

Having said that, Mr. Administrator, I have to, you know, really
ask the question about the comments about the design of our Space
Shuttle,  the  base—the  design  of  our  vehicle  in  absence  of  the  bio-
logical  and  life  sciences.  I  don’t  know  how  you  sent  up  astronauts
to the Moon or to Mars without that kind of research. And the Cen-
trifuge issue is of great importance. And I would like to know, you
know,  how  you,  you  know,  align  the  kind  of  decision  you  are  mak-
ing  when  in  a  press  conference  about  a  month  ago,  you  said,  ‘‘In
our  forward  plan,  we  do  not  take  one  thin  dime  out  of  the  science
program  in  order  to  execute  this  exploration  architecture.’’  How-
ever,  the  reality  is  that  there  have  been  major  cuts  to  NASA’s  life
science program as well as the elimination of almost all non-explo-
ration-related  scientific  research  on  the  International  Space  Sta-
tion.  How  do  you  square  that  statement  at  the  press  conference
with the actions taken by NASA to cut those activities?

The  other  question  is  many  life  science  research  communities
have  expressed  alarm  over  NASA’s  decision  to  terminate  the  ISS
Centrifuge  program  despite  finding  by  the  National  Academy  of
Sciences  that  the  absence  of  the  Centrifuge  would  hinder  NASA’s
ability to gain the fundamental knowledge essential to the mainte-
nance  of  the  astronaut  health  on  long-duration  space  missions.
Why  did  you  decide  to  terminate  the  program,  and  how  do  you  in-
tend  to  answer  the  research  questions  that  the  Centrifuge  was  de-
signed  to  address?  And  in  response  to  one  of  Chairman  Boehlert’s
questions,  for  the  record,  of  last  year’s  February  12  hearing  on  Vi-
sion  for  Space  Exploration,  NASA  stated:  ‘‘The  Centrifuge  Accom-
modation Module, CAM, still provides unique capabilities: the abil-
ity  to  simulate  a  full  Mars  mission,  including,  one,  long-duration
micro-gravity  followed  by  a  period  of  time  at  3/8  gravity,  two,  fol-
lowed  by  a  more  long-duration  micro-gravity  during  which  we  can
test bone loss, immunology, and other reactions to gravity changes.
In  situ  dissections  and  detailed  anatomy  physiology  after  exposure
to  a  fraction  of  gravity.’’  This  information  is  needed  to  determine
the  mechanisms  of  the  observed  changes  and  guide  the  develop-
ment  of  new  countermeasures,  and  I  think,  I  suspect,  the  design
of vehicles so that the folks who are in it are going to be taken care
of or, you know, be healthy as they go on their long—along the trip.
I would like to submit more detailed questions for the record and
get some responses to those questions. And if you don’t mind trying
to, with my three or four questions, formulate a response.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  We  certainly  will  take,  of  course,  your  questions  to

the record and answer them in full detail.

More broadly, let me say, first of all, that I certainly understand
the  rumors  that  are  flying,  but  at  this—the  United  States  has  not
broken  its  agreements  with  the  international  partners  and  hopes
not to do so. We have not done that.

The  Centrifuge  Accommodation  Module  is  built  for  the  United
States as part of a barter agreement with Japan, and the flying or
not  flying  of  the  Centrifuge  is  not  an  international  partner  agree-
ment.  It  is  a  matter  at  our  discretion.  We  have  chosen  not  to  fly
it,  because  we  do  not  have,  in—looking  ahead  at  the  sequence,  we
do not have a Shuttle flight available in the sequence that can put

that  module  up.  It  is  not  a  small  module.  And  because  the  life
science research that would be done on it is of a more fundamental
nature,  again,  associated  with  fundamental  organism  behavior  in
fractional gravity. Now that is a very interesting subject. It is a key
part  of  long-term  life  science  research,  but  it  is  not  immediately
and directly associated with the health of astronauts in orbit or on
the Moon in the near future.

Mr. HONDA. But how—to the Chair. How do you project physical
impact  and  physiological  impact,  anatomical  impact  on  humans
without that study? This—the——

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  The  gentleman’s  time  has  expired,  but  I
will give the courtesy to the Administrator to answer the question.
Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Well,  quite  frankly,  the  best  fractional  gravity  lab-
oratory  that  we  are  going  to  have  in  the  near  future  is  the  Moon.
That  will  be  a  very—putting  astronauts  on  the  Moon  and  leaving
them  there  for  a  lengthy  period  of  time  will  tell  us  much  of  what
we need to do about going to Mars.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
The distinguished Vice Chairman of the Full Committee, the gen-

tleman from Minnesota, Mr. Gutknecht.

Mr. GUTKNECHT. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

COMMERCIAL PARTICIPATION

And Mr. Griffin, welcome to the Committee. I hope that you will

make many appearances and brief us from time to time.

Sticking with the analogies, I am not going to—I am not here to
tee  off  on  you  today,  but  I  think  there  are  some  issues  that  need
to be addressed.

First  of  all,  my  own  feeling  right  now  is  that,  especially  after—
in the aftermath of Katrina, I think Americans are somewhat skep-
tical  of  the  Federal  Government’s  ability  to  do  the  things  that  we
claim  that  they  can  do.  I  also  believe  that  they  have  become  con-
vinced that just simply throwing more money at problems does not
guarantee  acceptable  results.  I  think  taxpayers  are  rightly  de-
manding  more  accountability.  I  applaud  you  for  this  matrix,  but  I
have  to  say,  not  only  your  department,  but  most  federal  depart-
ments, to have this many red squares is just unacceptable. We cer-
tainly  wouldn’t  accept  that  from  corporate  America,  and  American
taxpayers should not accept it from any federal agency as well.

One of the things that—one of the first things you said was with
the  last  launch  of  the  Shuttle  we  saw  chunks  of  the  foam  coming
off, and you said we haven’t completely solved the problem. I think
we  really  deserve  more  candor.  I  mean,  the  truth  of  the  matter  is
we haven’t solved the problem. I mean, that is my perspective, and
I think that is what we have to tell the American people.

Finally, and I guess this really does get at my question, we have
met  with  private  entrepreneurs  who  believe  that  they  can  launch
vehicles  and  put  payloads,  and  even  human  beings,  into  space  at
a fraction of the cost that it costs NASA to do the same thing.

I am wondering, as we go forward, can we look—I mean, the key
words that Americans are looking for is they are looking for reform,
they  are  looking  for  restructuring,  they  are  looking  for  account-
ability.  I  mean,  those  are  words  that  I  think—they  are  not  just
words. I think they are things that the American people now expect

53

and demand more of from those of us in Congress but, more impor-
tantly, from federal agencies in general.

So I wonder if you could comment on your vision of how we look
at  ways  that  we  can  achieve  the  same  results  at  significantly  less
cost, as at least some in the private sector believe that we can.

Dr. GRIFFIN. Yes, sir. I do understand that the public is skeptical
of  government  programs.  I  would  say  that  NASA’s  programs  his-
torically  have  an  overwhelmingly  high  success  rate  and  an  over-
whelmingly  high  positive  impact.  A  very  recent  Gallup  Poll  con-
ducted  showed  that,  when  asked  if,  at  a  budget  level  of  less  than
one percent of the budget, did the public approve of or support the
Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  which  included  finishing  the  assem-
bly  of  the  Station,  replacing  the  Shuttle,  and  continuing  on  to  the
Moon  and  Mars,  that  over  d  of  Americans,  you  know,  in  a  highly
bipartisan  way,  supported  those  goals.  And  as  you  well  know,
NASA  gets  about  7/10  of  a  percent,  not  even  a  full  percent,  of  the
budget.

So  I  think  public  support  of  NASA,  by  recent  measurements,  is,

frankly, at an all-time high.

With  regard  to  improving  accountability,  again,  I  can  only  say  I
can’t  agree  with  you  more.  I  could  not  agree  with  you  more  that
our  financial  accountability  must  reflect  that  which  we  expect  of
our  contractors,  and  I  am  working  to  restore  it.  My  team  is  work-
ing to restore it.

With regard to foam, unfortunately, NASA flew 113 Space Shut-
tle missions before seriously attempting to reduce the rate of foam
loss from its tanks to an acceptable level. It simply was not under-
stood. It is unfortunate. It was not understood that a piece of foam
could punch a hole in a wing. We then spent 2c  years trying to re-
duce that foam loss to nearly zero. We came close. We didn’t quite
get it. We believe, again, that we do understand it, and we believe
that  the  fixes  we  have  put  in  place  for  this  next  flight  will  solve
the  problem  to  the  level  that  we  need  it  solved.  Foam  loss  will
never  be  zero,  but  we  believe  we  have  fixes  in  place  that  will  con-
tain  it  to  a  level  that  is  not  harmful.  That  is  on  us  to  prove,  and
I understand that. I am out on a limb here. I understand we have
that to prove to you.

With  regard  to  entrepreneurs,  I  have  been  an  entrepreneur  a
couple  of  times.  It  is  fun.  It  is  a  very  heady  thing  to  do.  And  I  am
putting  money  at  stake  over  the  next  several  years  to  encourage
those  entrepreneurs  to  step  forward  and  show  what  they  can  do.
At  the  same  time,  NASA  has  mission  requirements,  government
mission  requirements  laid  on  us  that  we  cannot  afford  not  to  com-
plete.  So  while  I  am  enlisting  the  entrepreneurial  community  to
step  forward  and  help  meet  those  requirements,  we  cannot  stop
work on the, admittedly less efficient, government systems in order
that entrepreneurs either do or don’t show up. It is just—that just
doesn’t  work.  So  we  have  to  have  a  core  government  capability  to
execute  our  mission.  We  will  do  that  with  the  CEV  following  the
Shuttle. And we will do everything in our power to encourage these
entrepreneurial firms to step forward.

I  might—I  must  say  when  you  have  never  actually  done  any-

thing, talking about doing it is a very easy thing.

Chairman BOEHLERT. The gentleman’s time has expired.

Let  me  give  you  an  assessment  of  the  situation,  as  we  now  un-
derstand it. The bells are ringing. We have about 10 minutes to go,
which will afford us the opportunity for Mr. Miller to get his ques-
tioning  in.  We  are  trying  to  determine  from  the  cloakroom  just
what is going on. Apparently, the comity is dwindling and the com-
edy is on the asset. So we will find out, but we will go to Mr. Mil-
ler.

Our  desire,  Mr.  Administrator,  is  to  give  you  a  pause  to  get  a
drink  or  something  while  we  dash  over  and  then  come  back  and
then continue.
Mr. Miller.
Dr. GRIFFIN. I am at the Committee’s service.
Ms. JOHNSON. Could the gentleman yield?
Mr. MILLER. Yes.

NASA’S EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES

Ms.  JOHNSON.  Mr.  Chairman  and  Ranking  Member,  thank  you
very much for this hearing. I apologize for being late. I had another
engagement,  and  I  can’t  come  back  after  the  vote;  I  have  an
amendment on the Floor.

But  I  did  want  to  ask  this  question.  I  am  sorry  I  missed  a  lot
of  your  testimony,  but  I  appreciate  your  leadership.  And  I  really
appreciate the research that NASA has participated in and the out-
comes.

I  am  concerned  about  the  building  of  the  infrastructure  for  the
future.  And  in  that  end,  I  would  like  to  know  what  programs  you
still  have  going  that  would  invest  in  some  of  the  institutions  and
students  to  have  exposure  so  that  we  can  continue  to  build  the
workforce and the bright minds for NASA.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  NASA’s  educational  activities  are  an  integral  part
of  what  we  do  in  the  Agency.  This  year,  we  are  spending,  I—if  I
recall the figure correctly, $367 million on education. And if I don’t
have it exactly right, I beg your indulgence, but it is a number very
close  to  that.  That  is  enough  to  buy  a  whole  scientific  space  craft,
easily, every year that——

Ms.  JOHNSON.  Could  you  send  me  a  copy  of  your  breakdown  of

where that goes?

Dr. GRIFFIN. We certainly can do that.
Ms. JOHNSON. I appreciate that.
Dr.  GRIFFIN.  We  are  in  the  process  of—we—our  education  pro-
gram  has  been  criticized  by  many  outside  stakeholders  in  recent
years. I have taken that into account, and we have put a new per-
son,  Mrs.  Angela  Diaz,  in  charge  of  that.  We  are  crafting  a  new
strategic  plan  for  education.  We  are  emphasizing  commitments  to
university  students,  graduate  research,  exactly  the  kind  of  thing
you are talking about. We are taking it quite seriously.

Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much.
I look forward to getting that soon.
Dr. GRIFFIN. We will be happy to provide that.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
With that, we will take a temporary recess to go answer the call
of  the  House  and  see  what  we  can  do  to  contribute  to  restoring
comity, and then we will be back.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Let  us  resume,  and  we  will  resume  with

the—Mr. Miller, you are up.

Mr. MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

ENGINEERING AND SCIENTIFIC VALUE OF THE VISION

I recognize that you are—some of the other Members of the Com-

mittee would not feel cheated to have missed my questioning.

Mr. Griffin, my own preference for sports analogies is for basket-
ball  analogies,  but  I  am  afraid  that  George  Tenet  had  ruined  bas-
ketball analogies for politics for the next generation.

I want to follow-up on questions that Mr. Gordon asked and Mr.
Udall  asked  and  Mr.  Honda  asked  and  that  I  asked  back  in  June
about  the  science  programs  that  had  been  eliminated,  at  least  for
the  time  being.  And  my  concern  about  the  vision,  about  returning
first  to  the  Moon  is  not  that  it  is  too  ambitious  but  perhaps  it  is
not ambitious enough. It seems that all of the justifications that we
have discussed have to do with updating our engineering, the engi-
neering that put us on the Moon a generation ago, and simply up-
dating  that  to  show  we  can  do  it  again.  But  I  have  not  gotten  a
strong  sense  of  what  the  science  is,  if  any,  that  we  plan  to  accom-
plish on the Moon. You mentioned that the Moon was probably the
best  limited-gravity  environment  available  to  us,  but  what  is  the
science  that  we  plan  to  accomplish  on  the  Moon  by  going  there?
Are we simply updating our engineering from the Apollo era, or are
there scientific missions that we are going to perform on the Moon
that we think would be valuable?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Sir, I think those are great questions, and they are

at least two-prong, and let me take a whack at both prongs.

With  regard  to  the  engineering,  no;  we  are  not  simply  updating
our  engineering  from  the  Apollo  era,  although  some  of  that  does
need  to  be  done.  It  has  been,  not  one,  but  almost  two  generations
since we, the United States, owned the kind of space transportation
system that would allow us to go to the Moon.

The  ability  to  go  to  the  Moon,  when  one  then  adds  the  life  sup-
port  capabilities,  becomes  very  close  to  that  which  we  need  to  go
to Mars.

So  at  the  engineering  level,  it  is  not  about  the  choice  of  destina-
tion for the moment. It is about the creation of a basic space-faring
capability  beyond  low-Earth  orbit.  And  then  when  you  have  that,
you can go to the Moon, you can go to Mars, you can go to the near-
Earth asteroids. And that is what we are about.

With  regard  to  why  go  to  the  Moon  along  the  way,  I  appreciate
your  point  that  it  may  not  be  ambitious  enough  and  that  we  have
been there before. But there is hardly anyone now still working in
the space program who was part of those voyages. We have not in-
vested  in  that  avenue  for  almost  two  generations.  So  to  set  off  im-
mediately  to  Mars  without  the  experience  of  learning  to  live  and
work on the lunar surface a few days away seems, to me, to be fool-
ish.

With  regard  to  the  science,  the  Moon  is  an  excellent  laboratory
for  life  science  research  and  the  effects  of  fractional  gravity  and
deep  space  radiation  environment  on  humans,  at  least  in  some  re-
spects.  The  radiation  environment  at  Mars  will  necessarily  be  dif-
ferent  from  the  radiation  environment  on  the  Moon,  and  that,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:19 May 22, 2006 Jkt 024151 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\110305\24151 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

56

again,  will  be  different  from  the  radiation  environment  on  the
Space Station.

The Moon itself is a record of the sun’s behavior for the last four
billion  years.  It  is—it  may  well  be  the  only  place  in  the  solar  sys-
tem  where  we  can  capture  that  record,  which  is  embedded  in  the
lunar  regolith.  The  lunar  poles  form  a  micro-environment  on  the
lunar  surface  that  may  serve  as  cold  traps  for  billions  of  years  of
cometary impact, so that we can understand the constituents of the
primordial  materials  that  formed—from  which  the  Earth  and  the
other planets were formed.

The Moon is an excellent place from which to conduct radio teles-
copy  and  optical  astronomy.  The  Moon  is  a  very  and  extraor-
dinarily  interesting  place  in  and  of  itself.  We  will  want  to  explore
it.

The extent to which we want to trade money spent on the Moon
from money spent going to Mars is a matter for future Administra-
tors,  future  Congresses,  future  Presidents.  What  we  are  trying  to
do  today  is  to  put  into  place  the  capability  to  have  those  decisions
in  front  of  us.  Today,  we  have  no  decision  that  is  possible.  We  do
not  have  the  systems  that  would  allow  us  to  explore  either  Mars
or the Moon or anywhere else.

Mr.  MILLER.  So  at  some  point  in  the  five  to  10  years,  this  Con-
gress  is  going  to  have  to  decide  whether  to  invest  in  the  research
that would be necessary to take advantage of the opportunities that
have—that  putting  humans  on  the  Moon  again  will  present  to  us?
Dr.  GRIFFIN.  I  believe  that  is  right.  In  about  six  years,  we  will
have  delivered  the  CEV.  We  will  have  the  Station  assembled.  We
will,  at  that  point,  be  able  to  construct  a  heavy-lift  vehicle,  again,
a  Shuttle-derived  vehicle,  which  will  take  us  to  the  Moon  and
which  will  take  us  to  Mars.  And  then  it  will  be  up  to  the  Con-
gresses,  the  Administrations,  and  the  Administrators  of  that  time
to  decide,  in  detail,  what  to  do  with  that  capability.  We  have  put
an architecture on the table by which any or all of those things can
be  accomplished,  depending  on  the  funding  one  wishes  to  assign
and the priority one wishes to assign to the task.

Mr.  MILLER.  A  somewhat  related  question.  I  appreciate  the  sav-
ings  that  come  from  using,  to  the  extent  possible,  existing  tech-
nology,  off-the-shelf  technology  or  updating  the  technology  of  the
previous  generation.  I  still  like  to  think  of  it  as  just  the  last  gen-
eration  since  I  was  in  the  ninth  grade  when  we  landed  on  the
Moon. And I would like to think that two generations have not ex-
pired since I was in the ninth grade. But the cost of that, and one
of  the  great  advantages  of  the  first  effort  to  put  human  beings  on
the  Moon,  was  the  other  uses  of  the  technology  that  we  developed
and  what  we  did  to  stimulate  research  generally,  particularly  out
of  research  universities.  Are  we  not  cheating  those  other  reasons,
those  other  advantages,  from  space  exploration  by  our  complete
focus  on  the  economies  of  using  the  existing  technology?  Do  you
consider  whether  there  is  a  balance  to  be  struck  by  trying  to  de-
velop—purchase technologies or develop new technologies that may
have  the  collateral  benefits  of  research  that  can  be  used  in  other
ways  or  stimulation  of  research  universities?  Is  that  part  of  your
thinking at all?

57

Dr. GRIFFIN. I would like for that to be part of our thinking, but
the  realities  are—the  fiscal  realities  are,  first  of  all,  that  the  cre-
ation  of  the  transportation  architecture  to  take  people  beyond  low-
Earth orbit, or even to replace the Shuttle’s capabilities, are a high
barrier to entry. Most nations of the world cannot afford to get over
those  barriers  to  entry.  The  United  States  can,  but  barely  so.  We
are  not,  as  a  Nation,  able  to  allocate  the  priorities  of  space  explo-
ration that we did in the generation of which you speak.

To  put  numbers  on  it,  and  to  get  away  from  pure  dollar  esti-
mates, which change with time, it is commonly acknowledged today
that at least 400,000 people were engaged in civil space exploration
during  the  Apollo  years.  Today,  all  of  NASA’s  budget,  not  just  the
space exploration budget, purchases the services of only 75,000 peo-
ple. So we are spending less than a fifth for all of civil space explo-
ration,  less  than  a  fifth  of  what  we  spent  during  the  Apollo  years
in  terms  of  the  number  of  people’s  engagement  that  we  can  have.
That  said,  if  we  wish  to  make  other  choices,  that  is  always  pos-
sible  at  the  Congressional  and  Administration  level.  But  with  the
budgets  we  can  bring  to  bear  today,  we  must  concentrate  on  very
narrowly  defined,  very  carefully  defined,  very  specific  goals  that
produce  for  the  United  States  the  enabling  capability  we  need  to
get beyond low-Earth orbit, because that, again, is a very large bar-
rier to entry.

Chairman BOEHLERT. The gentleman’s time has expired.

CEV FUNDING AND EXPLORATION ‘‘SYNERGIES’’

I  just  want  you  to  know  that  sometimes  we  deliver  what  we
promise.  I  said  before  we  were  so  rudely  interrupted  by  the  need
to  go  to  the  Floor  to  vote  on  a  couple  of—a  dispute  over  a  proce-
dural  matter,  that  we  would  try  to  bring  some  order  over  there.
And we have. We are in recess now. So now we are back here.

Let  me  try  to  bring  some  clarity  to  an  earlier  question,  because

I am still sort of fuzzy about the specifics of your response.

If  the  vision  is  ‘‘go-as-you-pay,’’  are  we  going  on  with  a  CEV  ac-
celeration  when  the  NASA  budget,  as  a  whole,  does  not  yet  have
the funds to carry out that acceleration?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  We  believe  that  there  are  substantial  synergies  to
be  extracted  between  the  exploration  program,  as  we  have  defined
it that fits within its funding line, and the Shuttle program, as it—
as  we  have  inherited  it,  which,  as  you  have  observed,  does  not
quite fit within its funding line.

But  because  the  exploration  architecture  necessarily  is  derived,
as  Mr.  Miller  was  just  observing,  from  many  of  the  Shuttle  build-
ing  blocks  that  we  have  available  today,  tanks  and  engines  and
things  like  that,  we  believe  that  there  are  substantial  synergies  to
be extracted between the two programs.

Now  we  need  to  prove  that  to  you.  I  understand  that.  We  have
had  our  architecture  in  place  for  not  two  months.  We  conducted  a
very  intensive  study  over  the  summer,  focused  on  meeting  the
goals  of  the  vision  in  the  most  economical  and  time-efficient  way
that we could. We have not yet had time to blend that architecture
with the existing Shuttle and Station program and try to obtain all
of the efficiencies from those two things viewed as a combined pro-
gram.  We  believe  that  we  can  do  that.  We  believe  that  we  can  de-

liver  the  CEV  to  you  with  presidentially—the  presidential  budget
request.  We  believe  that  we  can  deliver  the  CEV  in  2012.  If  we
can’t,  then,  as  we  have  said,  it  is  a  ‘‘go-as-you-can-afford-to-pay,’’
and  we  will  slip  things  in  time,  and  yes,  that  will  mean  that  we
have sacrificed some efficiency.

Chairman BOEHLERT. And synergy is $5 billion?
Dr.  GRIFFIN.  As  I  said  earlier,  I  don’t  believe  that  the  total  gap,
at  this  point,  is  as  much  as  $5  billion.  I  really  believe  it  is  some-
what lower, on the order of a few billion.

Chairman BOEHLERT. But that is significant.
Dr. GRIFFIN. It is very significant. If I try to be more precise than
that  right  now,  I  would  be  making  it  up,  and  I  don’t  want  to  do
that. I need——

Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, we don’t want to make up as you go.
Dr. GRIFFIN. Right. I know. And we need the next six months to
be able to figure out how to blend the new exploration architecture
with  the  Shuttle  program  that  is  being  phased  out  to  see  how  we
can get our budget under control.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Well,  experience,  at  least  from  the  Chair’s
vantage  point,  has  been  that  when  you  have  said  that  you  need  x
amount  of  time,  in  this  case,  you  say  six  months,  to  bring  some
clarity  to  it,  you  usually  fulfill  your  promise  to  bring  some  clarity
to us. So we will take that.
Dr. GRIFFIN. I thank you.
I did—when I came in, I said in September I will have an explo-
ration  architecture  for  you,  and  I  have.  And  I  know  what—people
have  criticized  the  architecture  for  being  boring  because  it  uses  so
many old and preexisting components, but no one has said it is in-
efficient.  We  have  tried  to  do  that.  We  said  that  we  would  define
a Shuttle and Station architecture for you that fits within the num-
ber  of  flights  we  can  expect  the  Shuttle  fleet  to  have  before  it  is
retired. We have done that.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Is  your  sense—let  us  switch  over  a  little

bit.

FUNDING FOR THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE

Is  it  your  sense  that  the  Webb,  now  that  the  schedule  has  been
pushed  back,  can  stay  on  budget?  And  what  gives  you  that  con-
fidence?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Well, it is my sense, first of all, that the Webb Tele-
scope  project  is  not  overrun;  it  was  underbid.  I  have  tried  very
hard. The reason why I keep emphasizing that we have applied ap-
propriate cost reserves to the exploration architecture costing is be-
cause our industry, and our agency, has a history of underbidding.
And I am widely known not to support that nor want to do it.

We  have  had  two  independent  assessments  done  of  the  Webb—
of the James Webb Space Telescope, and both have concluded that
the program itself is actually doing rather well, but the funding al-
located  to  it  initially  was  under-scoped  by  about  $1.5  billion.  We
are  remedying  that  in  the  out-years  budgets.  We  are  slipping  the
telescope  slightly  to  allow—to  require  technology  developments  to
take  place.  We  think  we  will  get  it  on  target.  I  have  got  two  com-
pletely  independent  cost  estimates  on  the  matter.  They  agree  with

59

each other, and they agree as to the symptoms that led to the prob-
lem, so we are going to fix those.

KATRINA SUPPLEMENTAL

Chairman BOEHLERT. Let me ask you this. The White House has
asked  for  $325  million  for  NASA  to  help  pay  for  the  Katrina-re-
lated  costs  at  Stennis  and  Michoud.  That  is  not  nearly  enough.
That is about half of what you really need. Where is the additional
money going to come from?

Dr. GRIFFIN. We—as you know in our last operating plan, we had
requested $760 million, which was our best assessment of the dam-
age that we had. Then——

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  And  that  was  pared  down  considerably

from the initial——

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Well,  the  initial  estimate  was—we  were  still—I

think we were still cleaning up——

Chairman BOEHLERT. Okay.
Dr. GRIFFIN.—some of the stuff, and it was——
Chairman BOEHLERT. So the $760 million is the estimate?
Dr. GRIFFIN. Yeah. The directions I gave to my folks were do not
exaggerate the estimate. Every single thing that we put in the sup-
plemental  request  must  be  accounted  for.  When  we  got  done  with
that,  that  added  up  to  $760  million,  as  we  had  indicated  to  the
Committee.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  And  the  supplemental  contains  the—calls

for $325 million.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  And  that  had  a  reserve  on  it  of  20  percent  for  just
us  not  knowing  enough  about  what  we  were  doing  at  the  time  of
that  supplemental.  So  the  supplemental  that  you  saw  had  that  20
percent  reserve  removed.  It  also  had  removed  consequential  dam-
ages, as we would say them in the MBA world, consequential dam-
ages associated with delays to the Shuttle program and things like
that. So when those things were removed, you end up with the re-
quest that you got.

Now  bear  in  mind  the  Administration  does—is  reserving  the
right  to  come  in  with  another  supplemental  at  a  later  time  when
things  are  more  fully  understood.  So  I  don’t  believe  that  this  is  a
dead  issue.  We  think,  for  the  moment,  you  know,  we  are  fine  with
the $325 million.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  So  you  fully  anticipate  a  second  supple-
mental  so  you  won’t  have  the  need  to  raid  other  programs?  You
will have——

Dr. GRIFFIN. Exactly.
Chairman BOEHLERT.—the ability to pay the Russians, for exam-
ple, for Soyuz? And there are a lot of other things you have to pay
for.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  We  have  more  Katrina  damage,  and  again,  the  Ad-
ministration  may  very  well  bring  another  supplemental  to  the
table.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  And  I  am  sure  you  would  encourage  the

Administration to do so, at least with respect to NASA’s needs.

Dr. GRIFFIN. I will have my best begging face on. Yes.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
Who is next? Mr. Green.

Mr. GREEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank the Ranking

Member. And I thank Dr. Griffin.

THE COTS PROGRAM

Doctor, it was great to be with you. Just recently, Mr. Chairman,
I had the great opportunity to go to the Johnson Space Center and
to  receive  a  tour  and  to  have  the  benefit  of  Dr.  Griffin’s  insight
while I was there. I also had the opportunity to actually go within
the full-scale model of the Shuttle and to understand that it really
is a no-frills operation and apparently the little space for the num-
ber of people who have to use the instrumentality.

I  am  interested  in  the  $500  million  that  we  will  be  spending  for
commercial  space  travel  over  the  next  four  or  five  years.  My  first
question has to do with the many persons who are currently work-
ing  with  this  endeavor.  As  we  make  the  transition  to  bring  on
board private enterprise, how will that impact the persons who are
currently working in various positions?

Dr. GRIFFIN. The folks who are currently working on the Shuttle,
of  course,  will  be,  in  some  cases,  moved  over  to  the  CEV  and,  in
other  cases,  we  will  not  be  able  to  use  their  skills  on  the  new  sys-
tems.  And  in  yet  other  cases,  they  will  go  on  to  do  other  things.
But the overall NASA budget, in constant dollars through the years
in  question,  remains  about  the  same.  So  the  total  NASA  and  con-
tractor employment remains about the same. I mean, there will be
winners  and  losers,  but  at  a  national  level,  the  total  picture  re-
mains about the same.

For  that  portion  of  our  budget,  which  is  being  used,  frankly,  in
an effort to stimulate the entrepreneurial community, we are hope
that that will have leverage far beyond its amount, and it will actu-
ally increase the employment in aerospace by being able to attract
the investors and the backers of these private entrepreneurial com-
mercial  enterprises  to  be  able  to  participate  with  us  in  developing
capability  to  ferry  cargo  and  then  later  crew  into  space.  If  that  oc-
curs,  then  there  will  be  a  net  savings  for  us,  because  we  will  be
able, we hope, to purchase services now being provided by the gov-
ernment  at  a  lower  price  by  commercial  industry.  We  will  then  be
able  to  take  those  resources  and  utilize  them  for  the  frontier  role
of exploration, which we think is really NASA’s proper role.

Mr.  GREEN.  My  concern  emanates  from  the  notion  that  we  have
downsized, and I don’t like really using the term, but from 400,000
to  about  75,000,  as  you  indicated,  and  I  am  concerned  that  this
downsizing  will  continue  and  trust  that  it  won’t  have  an  adverse
impact  on  the  scientists,  the  engineers,  and  the  janitors,  the  per-
sons who are working currently in these programs.

But moving right along to my next concern, the process by which
we  will  make  this  transition,  the  selection  of  companies,  can  you
speak to this, please, in terms of how you propose that we do this,
such that we can get the entrepreneurs in place on time?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Well,  sir,  we  are  going  to—shortly  within  the  next
couple  of  months,  we  are  going  to  be  putting  a  solicitation  on  the
street,  as  we  say.  We  will  invite  competitions.  We  will  conduct  a
relatively  standard  source  selection,  evaluating  the  promised  offer-
ings,  and  we  will  pick  from  among  the  best.  I  don’t  have  any  spe-

cial wisdom or knowledge to bring to that task. It is something we
do fairly frequently.

Mr.  GREEN.  We  do  it  frequently,  but  have  we  done  it  for  an  en-
deavor of this magnitude before, because, literally, we are transfer-
ring  something  that  we  have  held  within  our  hands  to  private  en-
terprise?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  This  is  a  bit  new  for  us,  and  so  we  are  not  putting
all of our eggs in one basket. We are actually developing a new bas-
ket, and I will be paying close, personal attention to this one.

Mr.  GREEN.  Well,  I  thank  you  for,  again,  the  service  that  you
render.  It  was  an  honor  to  have  the  opportunity  to  visit  with  you.
And  I  am  sure  that  we  will  talk  more  about  these  things  as  we
progress.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  My  only  concern  is  when  you  were  in  the  Space

Shuttle simulator flying with Mr. Calvert and, you know——

Mr. GREEN. He was outstanding.
Dr. GRIFFIN.—who knew how that was going to come out.
Mr. GREEN. We had a safe landing.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I yield back.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Mr. Costa.
Mr. COSTA. Thank you very much.

SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION FOR A LUNAR MISSION

Mr.  Chairman,  I  do  want  to  commend  you  and  the  Ranking
Member  for  holding  this  hearing  today.  I  think  it  is  extremely  im-
portant  and  fitting  and  appropriate  that  we,  together,  determine
how  the  future  of  America’s  efforts  for  space  exploration  will  be
able  to  be  continued  over  the  next  several  decades,  and  so  the  de-
bate, the discussion, and the priorities that we establish are critical
to that future.

Mr. Griffin, I, too, want to give you high marks. As everyone has
indicated,  you  seem  to  have  taken  this  to—this  new  position  like
a  duck  to  water,  of  sorts,  and  everyone  believes  that  you  have  re-
turned  a  level  of  credibility  and  capability  that  is  essential  to
NASA’s long-term success.

I  have  two  questions  that  I  want  to  ask  you,  and  since  we  are
in  the  parlance  here  that—today  of  golf,  the  first  one  is  somewhat
of  a  gimmie,  the  second  one  may  be  a  little  more  of  a  difficult  ap-
proach shot that may require good chipping skills.

The first question, really, is based upon—and I am trying to com-
bine  things  that  have  been  discussed  here  this  morning  as  it  re-
lates  to  NASA’s  future,  which  is  the  science  and  the  finances  in
terms of how we pursue the science.

The  justification  of—for—with  the  CEV  project  to  go  back  to  the
Moon.  Obviously,  we  have  been  there.  We  have  accomplished  that
goal. But what sort of credibility are we all going to be able to talk
about  that  is  going  to  maintain  the  support  through  what  will  un-
doubtedly  have  to  be  successive  Administrations  that  may  vary  in
terms  of  political  partisanship  in  nature?  I  mean,  this  is  a  long-
term project, as you have described it today, and therefore, I think
the  credibility  of  the  science  on  why  we  should  go  back  is  going  to
have  to  be  essential,  and  we  are  going  to  have  to  be  able  to  sub-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:19 May 22, 2006 Jkt 024151 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\110305\24151 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

stantiate  it  in  order  to  maintain  the  successive  funding  necessary
to reach the goal.

62

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  That  is  correct,  sir,  and  I  would  be  happy  to  pro-
vide,  for  the  record,  a  brief  point  paper  on  what  we  think  some  of
the  scientific  returns  are  from  returning  to  the  Moon—for  return-
ing to the Moon.

But  beyond  that,  the  point  that  I  have  tried  to  make  in  many
venues,  and  I  will  try  again  in  this  one,  is  that  we  are  already,
today,  spending  a  significant  amount  of  money  on  human  space
flight, human space exploration. It has, for the past 30 years, been
limited to—more than 30 years, been limited to work in low-Earth
orbit.  Many  of  us  believe,  I  believe,  the  folks  who  put  together  the
Columbia  Accident  Investigation  Board  Report  believed,  and  this
Administration  believes  that  restricting  the  United  States  to  oper-
ations  in  low-Earth  orbit,  at  this  time,  and  for  our  future,  is  inad-
visable.  So  while,  obviously,  more  resources  to  do  that  job  are  al-
ways better than fewer, we are not, at this time, talking about the
addition  of  large,  new  resources  to  the  space  program.  Rather,  we
are  talking  about  redirecting  the  money,  which,  today,  is  being
spent on human space flight, into what we believe is a higher, bet-
ter,  more  important,  more  strategically-significant,  long-term  goal
for  the  United  States.  We  have  been,  and  we  will  be,  spending
money  on  human  space  flight.  We  want  to  spend  it  on  different
things that we believe are more strategically-relevant. That is fun-
damentally  what  we  are  talking  about  with  the  Vision  for  Space
Exploration. It does require—in the short-term, the next few years,
it  requires  some  hard  choices,  some  prioritization  of  goals.  It  re-
quires things I don’t like to do, like canceling advanced technology
and  not  doing  some  science  that  we  would  like  to  do,  because  we
are  trying  to  phase  out  an  older  program  and  phase  in  a  new  one
in such a way that we don’t have jarring disconnects.

So it is a tough problem, but that is the goal.
Mr. COSTA. And I think you have explained that quite clearly.

LEVERAGING FUNDING BY INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION

As  it  relates  to  the  finances,  and  Congressman  Rohrabacher  in-
ferred  and  talked  a  little  bit  about  it  as  he  related  to  our  partner-
ship with the Russians, and we have discussed it today as it relates
to our partnerships with others in the International Space Station,
if,  in  fact,  going  to  the  Moon  provides  a  sort  of  important  science
to  all  of  mankind  that  will  have  far-reaching  benefits,  and  if,  in
fact, which is, I think, true, and if, in fact, other countries are cur-
rently looking at trying to reach that goal, should we not be think-
ing  about  how  we  can  combine  resources  with  China,  with  Russia
to  share  the  costs?  And  notwithstanding  the  problems  that  have
manifested  themselves  in  our  partnerships  with  the  International
Space  Station.  I  would  think  that  we  could  learn  from  those  in
terms  of  how  we  view  the  long-term  in  combining  finances  and
thinking  out  of  the  box  to  make  those  finances  as  effectively-spent
as possible.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  I  couldn’t  agree  more,  and  on  Tuesday,  I  gave  a
major  speech  on  exactly  that  topic,  and  would  be—I  believe  we
have  provided  record  copies  to  some  of  your  staff,  and  I  would  be
happy  to  do  that.  I  am—have,  on  many  occasions,  said  that  I  be-

lieve  that  the  very  best  thing  for  our  long-term  future  in  space  to
come  out  of  the  Space  Station  partnership  is  the  partnership.  It
has  had  strains,  and  the  amazing  thing  is  it  has  endured  those
strains  and  remains  solid  today.  I—that  should  be  continued  and
should extend to the future.

Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I know I am out of time, but if you—
I  beg  the  Chairman,  I  think  this  is  an  area  that  we  need  to  con-
tinue to pursue and explore, given the nature of the challenges we
face.  And  I  would  be  very  interested  in  reading  your  paper  as  it
looks  to  prospective  opportunities  vis-a´-vis  thinking  out  of  the  box
in  terms  of  how  we  could  share  financial  responsibilities  as  we  go
to the Moon.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Mr. Costa.
And  you  are  a  major  player,  so  any  speech  you  give  is  major,  I

would think, in terms of significance, but——

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Would  you  talk  to  my  wife  about  that?  She  doesn’t

share your view.

Chairman BOEHLERT. I would welcome the submission if the staff

could provide a copy of that speech, because——

Dr. GRIFFIN. We can.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  And  incidentally,  when  you  give  some  of
these major speeches, the staff might be well-advised to share some
of  your  pearls  of  wisdom  with  us,  because  we  are  always  learning.
And  they—oh,  they  do.  Then  my  staff  would  be  well-advised  to
share some of your pearls of wisdom that you share with them with
me.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  We  did  provide  the  speech  to  staff.  We  really  did.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
And now that we are mentioning pearls of wisdom, the Chair rec-

ognizes the gentlelady from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. What an inviting presentation, Mr. Chairman,
and both in terms of the very erudite questions that the Chairman
has—the  Administrator  has  been  willing  to  take  from  my  col-
leagues. And thank you for yielding to me.

NASA’S WORKFORCE

Let  me  try  to  focus  narrowly  on  points  that  have  concerned  me.
And might I thank you for such an instructive visit to the Johnson
Space  Center  just  a  week  or  so  ago,  and  I  invite  my  colleagues  to
visit all of the Centers, but certainly come on down to the Johnson
Space Center where so much activity is occurring.

Might  I  also  commend  the  NASA  staff  and  cite  what  breath  of
fresh  air  the  recent  crew  continues  to  provide,  and  particularly
Commander  Collins,  who  I  know  has  a  certain  Congressperson  as
her Member of Congress.

But I would like to focus on some of the testimony we heard last
week  by  the  CFO  and  a  number  of  presenters,  including  the  In-
spector  General  and  those  individuals.  I  am  concerned  that  it  is
represented that 80 percent of NASA is contracted. And I say that
with  a  great  appreciation  for  the  public-private  collaboration  that
generates  from  many  of  our  aviation  research  companies,  and  we
know their names. And so when I begin this interest, I can imagine
the  frowning  looks,  with  respect  to  why  change  what  is  perceived
not  to  be  broken.  But  I  am  concerned  it  makes  it  a  very  difficult

maze  of  accounting,  which  may  be  one  of  the  issues  that  you  will
be  confronting,  but  also,  there  is  something  to  value  to  have  sys-
tems engineers, to have the next, if you will, group of scientists, en-
gineers, and others be looking to the government as a source to put
their knowledge, at least the initial level of their knowledge.

I  am  told  that  China  is  graduating  600,000  engineers,  and  we
are  graduating  70,000.  You  may  make  that  as  a  point,  but  that  is
the very reason why we need to be the recipient or the encourager
of that kind of talent.

I  understand  that  you  may  be,  over  the  next  couple  of  months,
terminating  1,800  to  2,000  permanent  employees.  Why,  if  that  is
the case? And I will speak before hearing, and that is obviously al-
ways  wrong  to  do,  but  I  will  do  so  and  say  that  I  oppose  that.  I
don’t  understand  it.  And  I  think  we  are  going  in  the  wrong  direc-
tion.

The other question would be on the issue of minority contractors.
I  still  don’t  believe  there  is  enough.  There  is  always  the  question
of  ethical  tampering—or  unethical  tampering,  and  then  that  al-
ways  leaves  us  without  anything  to  say.  The  percentages  are  not
high  enough.  I  would  like  them  to  be  high  enough.  I  would  like  to
be  a  minority-only  based  conference  to  show  minority  companies
around  the  country  how  do  you  effectively  interact  with  the  new
contractual  structure  that  NASA  has.  We  have  not  had  it.  And
when  I  say  minority,  minority  and  women.  I  think  that  is  impera-
tive.

And  my  last  two  points  is  your  thought  about  a  small  grant  to
outreach to women and minorities as it relates to sciences that gen-
erated  the  likes  of  a  Mae  Jemison  and  Colonel  Bolden  and  others.
And  with  that,  I  would  ask  if  you  would  share  in  your  answers  to
me.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  With  regard  to  workforce,  when  I  arrived  in  April,
we  had,  the  term  that  we  will  use  is  uncovered  capacity,  meaning
civil servants who did not have specific jobs to which they could be
assigned by virtue of the funding for—available from programs, you
know,  at  their  locations.  We  had  an  uncovered  capacity  of  over
2,000 civil servants. This is a problem that had been inherited from
many  years  of,  frankly,  not  actively  managing  the  match  of  our
workforce  skills  to  the  job  requirements.  We  are,  as  I  said  earlier,
paying close attention to that in aeronautics. We are returning our
aeronautics  program  to  a  program  of  fundamental  aeronautical
sciences research, which will help the issue.

On  the  new  work  that  we  are  doing,  the  CEV,  the  crew  launch
vehicle,  we  are  assigning,  as  much  as  possible,  work  from  Centers
that  have  surpluses  of  work  to  Centers  which  have  less  work.
Through  those  strategies,  we  have  reduced  the  uncovered  capacity
in  the  last  four  months,  since  we  have  been  working  the  problem,
down  to  about  950.  We  are—we  have  done—we  announced  one
final  buyout  the—to  be  conducted,  ending  in  January  of  2006.  We
believe  that  will  remove  several  hundred  people  from  civil  service
roles.

We  are  doing  everything  we  can  within  the  constraints  of  the
type of work that we are doing today to match that with the types
of skills we have and minimize any untoward actions.

By  next  June,  any  uncovered  civil  servants  that  we  still  have  in
place  will  have  to  be  rift.  That  will  be  our  very  last  alternative.  I
also,  Ms.  Jackson  Lee,  deplore  such  an  action.  I  have  encountered
that  twice  in  my  own  career,  in  various  circumstances.  It  is  not
fun, but we will do what we need to do in order to be fiscally sound
by next June.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. That will leave you with how many civil serv-

ants working for NASA?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Well,  it  depends,  again,  on  how  closely  we  are
able—we  think  we  can  get  any  rift  down  to  a  few  hundred  people,
but  at  the  end  of  the  day,  if  none  of  our  other  actions  works,  that
might  be  left,  and  that  would  leave  us  with  approximately  18,000
civil servants at NASA.

Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  And  about  2,000  would  be  in  the  group  that

either was placed somewhere or——

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Most  of  the  2,000  will  have  been  appropriately

placed.

Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  And  then  a  couple  of  hundred,  possibly,  if
there are still remaining with uncovered job descriptions or no jobs
available, would be rift around June of 2006?

Dr. GRIFFIN. That is correct.
Chairman BOEHLERT. I just want to make sure we clarify this for
the record, but the rift might be announced in June, but it wouldn’t
be effective until the next fiscal year, beginning in October?

Dr. GRIFFIN. In October. That is correct.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Okay. All right. Fine.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. So there would be a couple of months of tran-
sition.  Could  you  speak  to  the  issue,  because  I  think  this  is  some-
thing  I  want  to  pursue  with  you  in  office  and  I  won’t—because  of
the time, would you just answer the minority contractors issue and
the focused effort in the present configuration? And I know you are
getting  ready  to  say  we  do  this  all  of  the  time,  but  hear  me  out.
There  are  too  many  people  that  I  interact  with  that  suggest  we
don’t do it all of the time. There is just this confused maze on how
to interact under this new structure.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, let us hear a word from the Adminis-

trator on what they do do.

The gentlelady’s time is expired, but this is a good question, and

Mr. Administrator, we are anxious to hear from you.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  I  am  going  to  have  to  respond  for  the  record,  be-
cause  I  am  not  sure  exactly  what  you  are  asking.  I  attended,  just
within the last few weeks, a minority business conference where we
were  making  awards  to  our  important  minority  contractors.  The
impression  I  have  come  away  with  is  that  we  are  doing  fairly  well
in meeting our minority and women-owned contractor goals. If you
say  we  are  not,  I  will  take  that  under  advisement.  I  will  look  at
it,  and  I  will  get  back  to  you,  for  the  record,  on  how  we  are  doing
with those statistics. I had thought we were doing rather well.
Chairman BOEHLERT. And that would be helpful to all of us.
Dr. GRIFFIN. Yes.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  can  just  finish  one  sen-
tence, which is thank you very much. I do disagree, and I was talk-
ing  more  about  outreach,  because  there  is  a  pool  of  wide  breadth

that  don’t  have  the  inside  information  on  how  to  plug  in,  and  I
would like to work with you on that.

And I yield back.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you so much.
There is no time to yield back. We were very generous in extend-

ing the time——

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT.—but we appreciate your input.
The gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Gordon.
Mr. GORDON. Well, let me just conclude by saying thank you, Dr.
Griffin, for being here. Your predecessor, and others from NASA in
the  past,  have  taken  Muhammed  Ali’s  ‘‘Rope-A-Dope’’  to  another
level. You have not done that. You tried to be concise, and it makes
our job better, and I thank you for that.

Dr. GRIFFIN. Thank you, sir.

AERONAUTICS

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Well,  one  final  question,  and  this  involves

aeronautics.

We are pleased you are working to revive that area. That is very
important,  as  I  think  on—to  all  of  us  up  here.  And  what  are  we
going  to  do  to  make  sure  that  the  fundamental  research  NASA  is
planning  to  conduct  addresses  a  legitimate,  unmet  need  and  is
marketable in the outside world?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Our  new  Associate  Administrator  has  already  con-
ducted  a  couple  of  very  significant  workshops  with  regard  to  ex-
actly  that  question.  And  we  are  working,  as  well,  with  OSTP  and
with  FAA  and  DOD  in  the  opening  stages  of  crafting  a—for  a
long—knew  for  a  very  long  time,  since  we  have  had  one,  strategic
plan  for  aeronautics.  We,  at  NASA,  do  not  see  ourselves  being  the
only  stakeholders  in  aeronautics  in  this  country,  and  seek,  very
definitely, to find a partnership of people who can help us say what
it  is  that  needs  to  be  done  and  what  is  no  longer  required.  So  we
will not be do—acting unilaterally in that regard.

That  said,  okay,  we  believe—I  believe  that  aeronautical  science
in this country, the fundamental types of research that NASA, and
NACA  before  NASA,  used  to  be  known  for,  has  been  missing  for
a  while.  I  think  we  saw  a  recent  example  of  that  on  the  STS–114
flight with Discovery where we had—you will recall we had the gap
fillers that didn’t come out from between the tiles. There was some
great  concern  about  whether  those  might  interrupt  the  flow  of  air
on the undersurface coming in. We were not able to answer defini-
tively  whether  that  would  occur  or  not,  because  the  particular
flight  regime,  very  high  number,  very  high  altitude,  rarefied  flow,
very high temperature gas dynamics involving, as it does, the tran-
sition from laminar to turbulent flow, is an area of state-of-the-art
research  in  the  aeronautics  community,  and  we,  NASA,  have  not
been funding that. We should fund it.

Those  are  the  kinds  of  fundamental  sciences  that  we  need  to  be

doing, and I am convinced they will always be relevant.

TRANSFER AUTHORITY FOR THE KATRINA SUPPLEMENTAL

And if I could, before I end, make one final point.

On  your  Katrina  supplement  question,  you  know,  you  asked
about the money, but with the money, also, went a request, on our
part, to have the kind of transfer authority we need in order to be
able to move money from where it is to where it needs to be to deal
with the issues of recovering from Katrina. I would be——

Chairman BOEHLERT. Were you given that authority?
Dr.  GRIFFIN.  We  are  asking  for  it.  I  don’t  believe  we  have  it

Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, in closing, just let me make a couple

from—don’t have it yet.

of observations.

First  of  all,  I  hear  words  of  praise  for  the  new  team  you  are  as-
sembling, the cavalry of people you have been able to attract to this
very  important  agency  for  all  of  the  important  missions  you  have.
And  also,  with  some  degree  of  pride,  Mr.  Gordon  and  I  read  the
recent  survey  that  sort  of  estimated  what  all  of  the  employees  of
all  of  the  agencies  of  the  Federal  Government  think  about  their
role,  their  job  satisfaction,  the  purpose  of  their  mission,  et  cetera,
et cetera, and NASA was number one in this great big government
complex.  I  point  out,  with  some  degree  of  pride,  that  number  two
was  the  National  Science  Foundation.  And  I  point  out  that  that  is
under the jurisdiction of this committee, also.

So  you  have  a  most  challenging  assignment  during  a  most  chal-
lenging  time,  and  we  want  to  work  with  you.  And  we  appreciate
your approach to the job. We appreciate your availability, your can-
dor,  your  willingness  to  consult,  and  your  all-around  general  per-
formance.

Thank you very much, Mr. Administrator.
Dr. GRIFFIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Gordon. I very much

appreciate the opportunity to talk to you today.

Chairman BOEHLERT. The hearing is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 12:55 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Michael D. Griffin, Administrator, National Aeronautics and Space Ad-

ministration (NASA)

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. In  your  written  testimony,  you  say  ‘‘As  we  move  forward,  NASA  will  continue
working closely with our International Partners to determine how they may best
contribute to the Vision for Space Exploration.’’

Q1a. What does that mean in specific terms? How do you intend to make that deter-

mination?

A1a. Consistent  with  the  initial  steps  in  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  (VSE),
NASA  is  working  closely  with  its  international  partners  to  meet  its  commitments
on the International Space Station (ISS) program. In addition, in close coordination
with  the  partners,  NASA  is  working  to  refocus  its  ISS  research  efforts  to  support
U.S.  space  exploration  goals.  NASA  is  also  continuing  to  implement  its  existing
international  research  missions  such  as  Cassini/Huygens,  Mars  Global  Surveyor,
Mars  Express  Orbiter,  Venus  Express,  James  Webb  Space  Telescope  and  Mars
Science  Laboratory.  We  intend  to  maintain  these  strong  international  partnerships
that  have  been  built  throughout  NASA’s  history  and  extend  them  to  sustain  a  ro-
bust  robotic  and  human  space  exploration  program.  Since  the  VSE  was  announced,
NASA has engaged other nations on a bilateral and multilateral basis to discuss po-
tential  partnerships  to  advance  other  objectives  of  the  Vision.  For  example,  NASA
is  currently  in  the  process  of  negotiating  agreements  with  the  Indian  Space  Re-
search  Organization  to  host  two  NASA  instruments  on  its  first  lunar  mission,
Chandrayaan;  the  Russian  Federal  Space  Agency,  to  provide  a  neutron  detector  on
NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter; and conducting discussions with the Italian
Space  Agency,  and  Japan  Aerospace  Exploration  Agency,  who  are  developing  their
own  lunar  missions,  on  possibilities  for  scientific  data  exchange.  NASA  also  con-
ducted  a  series  of  workshops  in  2005  aimed  at  understanding  international  plans
for  space  exploration.  In  2006,  NASA  is  planning  a  second  series  of  workshops,
starting in the spring, to advance our understanding of potential international rela-
tionships in preparing humans and robots to explore the Moon and Mars. We intend
to  do  this  in  a  non-prescriptive  manner.  In  addition,  John  Logsdon,  director  of  the
Space  Policy  Institute  at  George  Washington  University  in  Washington,  DC,  has
been tasked by NASA to gauge areas of potential international collaboration in line
with the Vision for Space Exploration. While the U.S. will provide the human-rated
and heavy lift transportation systems to enable us to travel from the surface of the
Earth  to  the  Moon,  develop  lunar  capabilities,  and  then  go  on  to  Mars  and  other
destinations, we are exploring with international space agencies the best opportuni-
ties for international partnerships and relationships to occur, including as:

• Habitats, rovers, power and logistics;
• Science and in-situ resource utilization equipment;
• Data sharing;
• Lunar robotic pre-cursor missions; and
• Enhanced ISS re-supply.

Q1b. Does NASA have enough money set aside in its exploration plan to develop the
lunar  infrastructure  it  will  need  to  make  its  lunar  activities  meaningful—or
does NASA require international cost-sharing to make it work?

A1b. International cooperation is an integral element of the Vision for Space Explo-
ration.  Although  NASA  could,  in  theory,  achieve  the  major  milestones  of  the  vision
without  international  cooperation,  we  must  maintain  the  strong  international  part-
nerships that have been built during the Space Station era, and must extend those
partnerships  even  more  broadly,  to  enable  a  robust  human  space  exploration  pro-
gram.  The  development  of  crucial  infrastructure  such  as  lunar  habitats,  power  sta-
tions, scientific laboratories and facilities, radio and optical telescopes, human-rated
and  robotic  surface  rovers,  unmanned  logistics  and  resupply  vehicles,  communica-
tion  and  navigation  systems,  in  situ  resource  utilization  equipment,  and  long-dura-
tion  life  support  systems  may,  in  part,  result  from  a  great  exploration  partnership
between nations. We will need the aid of the international community as we encour-
age space exploration that will ultimately benefit all humankind; however, given the
cooperative nature of international participation in the Vision, it is difficult to quan-
tify the level of investment of existing and potential partners in the VSE.

Q1c. Your statement appears to be based on the unstated assumption that the Inter-
national Partners are going to sign up to an American Vision for Space Explo-
ration  that  they  had  no  role  in  developing.  How  confident  are  you  that  they
want to participate on those terms?

A1c. We  are  not  prescribing  the  form  such  international  contributions  must  take.
NASA  is  not  laying  out  a  NASA-approved  master  plan  for  the  infrastructure  re-
quired  for  lunar  exploration,  which  would  then  be  prescribed  for  any  partners.
NASA  seeks  to  work  with  the  space  agencies  of  interested  nations  to  find  ways  to
reach  common  objectives.  We  know  from  decades  of  international  cooperation  in
space activities—most prominently on the International Space Station—that this ap-
proach  to  lunar  exploration  can  work.  We  recognize  that  the  international  partner-
ship formed to develop the ISS has been one of the program’s best and most endur-
ing  features.  We  are  confident  that  some  of  the  most  creative  approaches  to  21st
century  lunar,  and  subsequently  Mars,  exploration  will  arise  out  of  similar  future
international collaborations. During recent visits between the NASA Deputy Admin-
istrator  Shana  Dale  and  NASA’s  International  Partners,  there  was  much  interest
in  participating  in  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration.  We  hope  to  promote  common
space  exploration  objectives  and  cooperative  or  complementary  space  exploration
missions,  along  with  the  development  of  breakthrough  technologies  that  will  open
up  many  opportunities  for  exploration  and  discovery.  In  the  near-term,  cooperative
efforts in robotic precursor missions have already been formed. For example, NASA
is  currently  in  the  process  of  negotiating  agreements  with  the  Indian  Space  Re-
search  Organization  to  host  two  NASA  instruments  on  its  first  lunar  mission,
Chandrayaan; and the Russian Federal Space Agency, to provide a neutron detector
on  NASA’s  Lunar  Reconnaissance  Orbiter.  NASA  is  also  initiating  discussions  with
the Italian Space Agency, and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, who are devel-
oping their own lunar missions, on possibilities for scientific data exchange.
Q2. What  do  you  consider  to  be  the  most  important  justification  for  the  planned
human  lunar  exploration  program:  Preparation  for  human  missions  to  Mars?
Scientific research on the Moon? National prestige? Or something else?

A2. Each of the lunar exploration themes that was mentioned as a goal: preparation
for Mars, scientific research on the Moon, and National science and technology capa-
bilities,  along  with  many  others  including:  advancing  technology;  enabling  inter-
national partnerships; and encouraging commercial development activities, is key to
a comprehensive lunar exploration effort. In many cases, specific activities that may
be  planned  for  future  robotic  and  human  missions  to  the  Moon  might  each  support
a number of these lunar exploration themes. The primary challenge is to determine
an optimal way to integrate these themes into a comprehensive, efficient and highly
effective  strategy  of  lunar  exploration.  In  2006,  NASA  is  leading  an  effort  to  pull
together  the  various  constituent  groups  from  the  science  and  space  commercializa-
tion areas, along with representatives from the space agencies of many nations who
have a strategic interest in exploring the Moon. The goal of this activity is to bring
these  communities  together  to  discuss  common  and  conflicting  interests  and  to  es-
tablish an integrated strategy for lunar exploration. Within this strategy, NASA will
be pursuing a number of roles, including:

• Providing leadership in exploration of the Moon;
• Developing advanced technologies;
• Enabling lunar commerce, international participation, and science;
• Preparing for future human missions to Mars—these missions will not be safe
without  having  first  gained  experience  through  our  lunar  exploration  effort.
Q3. A ‘‘go as you can pay’’ approach to NASA’s Exploration program seems to make
sense.  However,  I  am  not  sure  how  it  would  work  in  practice.  In  other  words,
once the contractor and civil service ‘‘standing army’’ is in place to support var-
ious  Exploration-related  development  projects,  stretching  the  exploration  sched-
ule  due  to  budgetary  shortfalls  will  likely  result  in  increased  project  costs  due
to the need to keep the workforce on the payroll longer. The desire to avoid such
cost increases would seem to lead to pressure to transfer funds from other parts
of the NASA budget to avoid delaying the exploration projects.
• Can you explain how you would avoid such a situation from developing?
• Several  years  ago,  Tom  Young’s  IMCE  Task  Force  attributed  a  share  of  the
International Space Station’s cost growth to NASA managing that program to
meet  annual  budgetary  targets.  Isn’t  managing  the  program  on  a  ‘‘go  as  you
can  pay’’  basis  essentially  the  same  thing?  How  do  you  plan  to  avoid  getting
into the same situation that the IMCE warned against?

A3. NASA’s  budget  for  Exploration  uses  a  ‘‘go  as  you  can  afford  to  pay’’  approach
that  requires  the  Constellation  program  to  accomplish  the  Vision  for  Space  Explo-
ration in a given budget profile. The work and workforce are planned such that we
can efficiently utilize the resources in any given year as we are working toward ac-
complishing  the  Vision.  Go  as  you  can  afford  to  pay  does  not  equate  to  having  an
arbitrarily chosen level-of-effort workforce working without a plan. Rather it reflects
a  plan  that  joins  an  appropriate  amount  of  specific  content  taking  place  any  given
year with the appropriate level of phased funding to accompany a set of defined mis-
sion activities. It only means that we will have to accomplish the work within a set
budget.  In  effect,  it  means  that  the  exact  year  we  accomplish  our  objectives  may
move  earlier  or  later,  depending  on  whether  we  find  efficiencies  within  our  present
plan or whether we encounter unanticipated difficulties.
Q4. When  will  NASA  have  a  transition  plan  for  the  Shuttle  workforce  completed?
A4. As  requested  in  the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005  (P.L.  109–155),  NASA
plans to deliver a Space Shuttle workforce transition plan to the Congress by March
31, 2006. We expect to deliver this plan by the end of March or early April.
Q5. NASA  is  part  of  the  Joint  Planning  and  Development  Office  (JPDO)—a  joint
initiative  by  NASA,  FAA,  DOD,  and  other  federal  agencies  to  develop  the  next
generation  air  transportation  system.  The  JPDO  is  depending  on  NASA’s  R&D
to  meet  the  goals  of  its  integrated  plan,  which  will  require  an  increasing  com-
mitment  of  NASA  resources  over  the  next  five  years  and  beyond.  However,
NASA’s aeronautics budget is projected to decline significantly over the next five
years under the Administration’s budget plan. How do you plan to meet NASA’s
commitment  to  the  research  needs  of  the  JPDO  under  a  declining  NASA  aero-
nautics budget?

A5. One of the three guiding principles of the reshaped Aeronautics Program is our
commitment to align directly our Air Traffic Management research and development
to  address  the  fundamental  research  challenges  inherent  to  the  NGATS  vision  ar-
ticulated by the Joint Planning & Development Office (JPDO).

The  JPDO  has  identified  the  capability  requirements  needed  for  the  NGATS,  as-
signing key roles to the member agencies. NASA’s research will help make NGATS
possible  by  taking  on  some  of  the  most  technically  challenging  aspects  of  system
transformation.  The  research  spans  critical  technology  for  intelligent  aircraft  sys-
tems and advanced vehicle performance and forms the foundation for safety and ca-
pacity in the future. The unprecedented challenges faced in this transformation will
require a focused and long-term commitment by NASA and its federal partners.

The  JPDO  has  reviewed  the  early  elements  of  the  re-planned  Airspace  Systems
Program and has provided comment on their relevance and priority within the over-
all  vision  of  NGATS  2025.  As  the  detailed  technical  and  programmatic  planning  of
the ASP project elements ensues over the next several months, NASA will maintain
a  continuing  dialogue  with  the  JPDO.  This  will  ensure  that  the  Airspace  Systems
research  agenda  continues  to  focus  on  the  high-value  challenges  facing  the  JPDO
vision for 2025 and, hence, the critical concerns of society and the aviation industry.
The  investment  of  the  Airspace  Systems  Program  resources  will  be  made  in  the
most efficient manner possible to enable the greatest impact for the transformation
of the national airspace system.
Q6. Senior  management  at  both  Goddard  Space  Flight  Center  and  the  Jet  Propul-
sion Laboratory have emphasized the need to maintain in-house at least one pro-
gram of a reasonable scale and with significant technical challenges in order to
provide  the  kinds  of  experiences  needed  to  develop  the  employee  skills  needed  to
create the kind of managers you intend to rely on. Do you agree with that philos-
ophy? If so, how will it be implemented?

A6. NASA’s  new  Strategic  Plan  (p.  23)  states  that  the  SMC  proposed  a  set  of  at-
tributes  that  define  strong,  healthy  Centers.  These  attributes  included,  inter  alia,
‘‘Major in-house durable space flight responsibility’’ and ‘‘Technically competent and
value  centered  leadership.’’  To  implement  this  strategy,  agency  business  planning
processes will reflect this strategic direction:

• Centers  will  be  expected  to  build  and  maintain  their  internal  capabilities
through  identification  of  such  work  that  supports  Mission  Directorate  pro-
grams and execution of that work that is assigned to them;
• Mission Directorates will be expected to assist the Centers in identifying and
assuring  that  work  within  the  Mission  Directorates’  portfolios  that  can  pro-
vide  this  kind  of  needed  experience  to  Center  workforces  is  assigned  to  cen-
ters for this purpose; and

• the Agency will monitor the extent to which centers’ workload contains appro-
priate  work  of  this  nature  and  take  steps  in  the  overall  business  planning
process  (e.g.,  strategic  make/buy  decision)  to  remedy  any  situation  where
issues  develop  with  respect  to  sustaining  this  type  of  work  at  a  particular
Center.

The Administrator underscored this in his budget rollout yesterday that included
the  statement  that  NASA  will  assign  new  projects  to  field  centers  to  strengthen
their base of in-house work.

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. What  are  the  prioritized  objectives  of  NASA’s  plans  for  human  activities  on  the

lunar surface? How were those objectives determined and prioritized?

A1. The  objectives  of  the  lunar  exploration  effort  include  preparation  for  Mars  and
other  destinations,  scientific  research  on  the  Moon,  improving  national  science  and
technology  capabilities,  advancing  technology,  enabling  international  partnerships,
and  encouraging  commercial  development  activities.  In  many  cases,  specific  activi-
ties that may be planned for future robotic and human missions to the Moon might
each  support  a  number  of  these  lunar  exploration  themes.  The  primary  challenge
is to determine an optimal way to integrate these themes into a comprehensive, effi-
cient and highly effective strategy of lunar exploration.

In 2006, NASA is leading an effort to pull together the various constituent groups
from the science and space commercialization areas, along with representatives from
the  space  agencies  of  many  nations  who  have  a  strategic  interest  in  exploring  the
Moon.  The  goal  of  this  activity  is  to  bring  these  communities  together  to  discuss
common  and  conflicting  interests  and  to  establish  an  integrated  strategy  for  lunar
exploration. Within this strategy, NASA will be pursuing a number of roles, includ-
ing:

• Providing leadership in exploration of the Moon;
• Developing advanced technologies;
• Enabling lunar commerce, international participation, and science;
• Preparing for future human missions to Mars—these missions will not be safe
without  having  first  gained  experience  through  our  lunar  exploration  effort.
Q2. What are the prioritized scientific objectives of NASA’s human lunar exploration
program?  How  were  those  objectives  determined  and  prioritized?  If  such  a  set
does not yet exist, when will it be available?

A2. NASA plans to establish an integrated set of long-range science goals for robotic
and human lunar exploration. Important aspects of lunar science were addressed in
the  NRC’s  recent  solar  system  exploration  decadal  survey,  New  Frontiers  in  the
Solar System. At the present time, SMD is working with the NASA Advisory Coun-
cil on a near-term plan to review and extend these and other identified science pri-
orities that can be addressed on the Moon in the context of the broader science pro-
gram. This process is expected to also involve the NRC Space Studies Board.
Q3. Does NASA plan to issue an updated strategic plan? If so, when?
A3. On February 6, 2006, NASA issued a new 2006 NASA Strategic Plan. The Stra-
tegic  Plan  is  available  online  at:  http://www.nasa.gov/about/budget/index.html.
We do not plan to publish another strategic plan for three years.
Q4. In  your  June  28,  2005  appearance  before  the  Science  Committee,  you  indicated
that the restructured research plan for the International Space Station program
would be provided to the Congress ‘‘later this summer.’’ As of the November 3rd
hearing, it still had not been transmitted to Congress. Please provide the restruc-
tured ISS research plan for the record.

A4. A  consolidated  ISS  Utilization  plan  is  being  prepared  for  the  Congress  per  the
Authorization  Bill,  and  will  be  delivered  to  Congress  on  or  before  the  90-day  re-
quirement (March 30, 2006).
Q5. In  your  June  28,  2005  appearance  before  the  Science  Committee,  you  also  indi-
cated that the proposed final configuration and assembly sequence for the Inter-
national  Space  Station  program  would  be  provided  to  Congress  later  this  sum-
mer.  As  of  the  November  3rd  hearing,  it  still  had  not  been  transmitted  to  Con-
gress.  To  date,  all  Congress  has  seen  is  a  one  and  a  half  page  summary  of  the
study’s results. Please provide for the record the following items:

Q6. Many in the life sciences research community have expressed alarm over NASA’s
decision to terminate the ISS Centrifuge program in the face of decades of find-
ings by the National Academy of Sciences that the absence of a Centrifuge could
hinder  NASA’s  ability  to  gain  the  fundamental  knowledge  essential  to  mainte-
nance of astronaut health on long-duration space missions.
• Why did you decide to terminate the Centrifuge program?
• How  do  you  intend  to  answer  the  research  questions  that  the  Centrifuge  was

designed to address?

A6. NASA has eliminated animal research on the centrifuge for the ISS after evalu-
ating the relative costs and benefits of this program. In particular, the research has
been  canceled  because  of:  1)  a  higher  priority  for  biomedical  research  with  human
subjects than for research with animals to meet the Nation’s exploration goals; and
2)  logistic  priorities  caused  by  the  requirement  to  focus  remaining  Shuttle  flights
on finishing the International Space Station, and the inability to plan to send speci-
mens and supplies to the ISS for use on the centrifuge between 2010 and 2016.

While  the  full  research  program  centered  around  CAM  and  the  questions  it  was
intended to address will not be fully realized, there will be new, but reduced NASA
research opportunities in biomedical science. The life sciences research portfolio con-
tent  has  shifted  from  lower  Technology  Readiness  Levels  (TRLs)  to  higher  TRLs
with  more  specific,  directed  outcomes  than  was  required  in  the  past.  In  addition,
15  percent  of  the  funds  budgeted  for  ISS  research  will  be  allocated  to  a  potential
combination  of  ground-based,  free-flyer,  and  ISS  life  and  microgravity  science  re-
search that is more fundamental in nature and not directly tied to exploration goals.
Q7. NASA’s new Associate Administrator for Aeronautics has announced that NASA
will  reorient  its  activities  away  from  technology  demonstrations  and  technology
development  programs  to  fundamental  research.  While  it  makes  sense  to  restore
a  fundamental  aeronautics  research  program  at  NASA,  there  is  concern  within
the aviation community that NASA is at serious risk of eliminating R&D of rel-
evance  to  the  aviation  industry  and  critical  to  addressing  societal  concerns  re-
lated  to  aircraft  noise,  emissions,  and  congestion  in  the  air  transportation  sys-
tem.
• How  do  you  plan  to  ensure  that  NASA’s  R&D  activities  will  be  both  relevant

and of sufficient magnitude to have a positive impact?

A7. The JPDO has reviewed the early elements of the re-planned Airspace Systems
Program and has provided comment on their relevancy and some indication of their
priority within the overall vision of NGATS 2025. As the detailed technical and pro-
grammatic  planning  of  the  ASP  project  elements  ensues  over  the  next  several
months, the results of the review by the JPDO will guide program content to ensure
relevancy  and  impact  to  the  JPDO  vision  for  2025  and  hence  address  the  critical
concerns of society and the aviation industry.

In  addition,  NASA  is  taking  a  fresh  look  at  the  research  required  to  ensure  that
future  air  vehicles  will  be  environmentally  compliant.  We  have  solved  some  of  the
problems that we have already addressed. We have reduced NOΧ emissions through
a  low  NOΧ combustor  that  produces  70  percent  less  emissions  than  a  reference  de-
sign. We have reduced engine noise to the point that almost half the noise produced
by aircraft on approach to an airport is generated with the engines off. But the days
of  working  problems  in  isolation  are  over.  We  cannot  work  emissions  and  noise
without  also  addressing  overall  vehicle  efficiency  if  we  want  to  see  environmental
solutions make their way into the aircraft fleet. A holistic approach requires signifi-
cant  advancement  in  our  design  capabilities.  This  in  turn  requires  substantial  in-
vestment  in  cutting-edge  research  across  the  breadth  of  aeronautics  disciplines.
Only  then  will  we  be  able  to  design  the  vehicles  that  meet  these  future  challenges.
NASA  is  taking  a  long-term  strategic  approach  to  the  enabling  technologies  that
are  critical  to  the  future  of  aviation.  We  are  developing  system-level,  multi-discipli-
nary tools to enable advanced civil and military aircraft. The key to addressing soci-
etal concerns such as noise and emissions is to take a systemic view of these issues.
We  must  design  the  total  aircraft  for  low  noise  rather  than  simply  producing  low-
noise components (such as engines). These designs will take industry out of the com-
fort  zone  where  they  have  years  of  prior  experience,  and  the  advanced  design  tools
we  develop  will  allow  us  to  work  these  radical  new  designs.  We  will  work  funda-
mental  scientific  and  engineering  issues  in  noise  and  emissions  generation  such  as
noise  source  characterization,  combustion  chemistry,  and  active  flow  control  which
are needed to enable breakthroughs in noise and emissions reduction. We will work
to  better  understand  what  emissions  components  are  most  hazardous,  and  we  will
develop  new  scientific  standards  for  emission  levels.  Finally,  we  will  address  chal-

lenges  in  performance  to  ensure  that  our  industries  and  our  airlines  remain  com-
petitive in the global marketplace.

The  NASA  aeronautics  program  has  changed  precisely  because  the  problems  we
must solve in the 21st century are that much harder. We choose to invest in funda-
mental research because it is the only rational way forward.

Question submitted by Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson
Q1. What are NASA’s current efforts in funding and support for science, technology,

engineering, and math education and career development?

A1. Education  is  a  fundamental  element  of  NASA’s  activities  reflecting  a  balanced
and diverse portfolio of: Elementary and Secondary Education, Higher Education, e-
Education,  Informal  Education,  and  Minority  University  Research  and  Education
Programs.

Previous experience has shown that implementing exciting and compelling NASA
missions  are  critical  to  inspiring  the  next  generation  of  explorers,  innovators,  and
leaders. Through partnerships with the Agency’s Mission Directorates, other federal
agencies,  private  industry,  scientific  research,  and  education/academic  organiza-
tions,  we  are  applying  NASA’s  unique  mission  and  education  initiatives  (content,
people,  and  facilities)  to  spark  student  interest  and  to  guide  them  toward  careers
in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).

To compete effectively for the minds, imaginations, and career ambitions of Amer-
ica’s  young  people,  NASA’s  Office  of  Education  has  created  a  diverse  portfolio  of
education  initiatives  that  focus  on  engaging  and  retaining  students  in  STEM  edu-
cation  programs  to  encourage  their  pursuit  of  educational  disciplines  critical  to
NASA’s future engineering, scientific, and technical missions. In addition to the pro-
grams managed by the Office of Education outlined below, NASA invests additional
resources in Mission Directorates and NASA Center operations to address education
programs. The education portfolio includes the following:
Elementary and Secondary Education
Educator Astronaut Program selects outstanding educators to become permanent
members  of  the  Astronaut  Corps.  The  program  uses  the  visibility  and  educational
opportunities created by the activities of the Educator Astronauts to inspire greater
K–12 STEM achievement, promote STEM careers, and elevate public esteem for the
teaching  profession.  The  program  has  also  trained  the  top  tier  of  Educator  Astro-
naut  applicants,  called  the  Network  of  Educator  Astronaut  Teachers,  to  perform  as
NASA  Education  advocates  by  engaging  their  schools  and  communities  in  NASA
education  activities  and  informing  them  of  NASA  resources  (content,  people,  facili-
ties).
Aerospace  Education  Services  Program  serves  the  elementary  and  secondary
education  community  by  providing  classroom  demonstrations,  faculty  workshops,
parent  training,  in-service  training  for  teachers,  and  identification  of  appropriate
classroom  resources.  NASA  uses  former  teachers  who  are  well-trained  and  well-
equipped in STEM content.
NASA Explorer Schools offers a three-year partnership between NASA and school
teams,  consisting  of  teachers  and  education  administrators  from  diverse  commu-
nities across the country. Focusing on under-served populations, the program is de-
signed for education communities at the 4–9 grade levels to help middle schools im-
prove teaching and learning in STEM education through significant structural (pro-
fessional  development,  stipends,  grants)  and  curricular  support  based  on  NASA  re-
sources.
Science Engineering Mathematics and Aerospace Academy Program reaches
K–12  minority  students  that  are  traditionally  under-represented  in  careers  involv-
ing  STEM.  Students  meet  during  school,  after  school  or  on  Saturday  mornings  and
during  the  summer  to  engage  in  hands-on,  interactive  learning  sessions  that  are
specifically designed for each grade level.
Education Flight Projects provides hands-on experiences to inspire and motivate
students to pursue studies and careers in STEM through participation in NASA re-
search  applications.  Programs  are  integrated  into  a  seamless  pipeline  to  encourage
sustained  student  interaction  with  NASA  that  results  in  expanding  the  pool  of
human capital to meet the needs of NASA and its partners.

Higher Education
Space Grant, a national network of colleges and universities, works to expand op-
portunities  for  students  and  faculty  to  understand  and  participate  in  NASA’s  aero-
nautics  and  space  programs  by  supporting  and  enhancing  science,  and  engineering
education, research, and public outreach programs.
Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research develops academic
research  enterprises  that  are  long-term,  self-sustaining,  and  nationally  competitive
by  supporting  states  with  modest  research  infrastructure  to  become  more  competi-
tive  in  attracting  research  funding.  Over  twenty  states  may  be  eligible  to  compete
for funding to foster a STEM relationship with NASA for research and development
opportunities.
Graduate  Student  Researchers  Program  cultivates  research  ties  to  the  aca-
demic community to help meet the continuing needs of the Nation’s aeronautics and
space  effort  by  increasing  the  number  of  highly  trained  scientists  and  engineers  in
aeronautics and space-related disciplines, and broadening the base of students pur-
suing  advanced  degrees  in  science,  mathematics,  and  engineering.  The  program
awards fellowships for graduate study leading to masters or doctoral degrees in the
fields of science, mathematics, and engineering related to NASA research and devel-
opment.
Undergraduate Student Researchers Program attracts undergraduate students
from the widest array of backgrounds, who are fully representative of America’s ra-
cial,  ethnic,  and  cultural  diversity;  and  provides  them  with  hands-on,  challenging
research  experiences  that  stimulate  continued  student  interest  in  the  fields/dis-
ciplines aligned with NASA’s research and development mission.

e-Education
Learning  Technologies  Project  (LTP)  develops  and  refines  leading-edge  or  cut-
ting-edge  technologies  that  are  in  use  within  NASA  missions  and/or  projects  to  en-
hance  the  teaching  and  learning  of  scientific  concepts.  Technologies  funded  under
LTP are incubated and developed, evaluated, and leveraged with strategic partners
to extend reach into educational and commercial applications.
NASA Educational Technologies Services support the publishing and is respon-
sible for maintaining the educational content on the NASA Portal and managing the
operation of the Office of Education Web site, and other electronic-based dissemina-
tion networks. Additional Web support is provided in the identification and linkage
of multimedia resources to support the education video file (education programming)
on the NASA TV Public Services channel and NASA TV Education Services channel.
Classroom  of  the  Future  conducts  empirical  educational  research  then  develops
and tests off-the-shelf and new or evolving educational technologies that incorporate
research findings on cognition and effective application of technology to educational
settings.  The  educational  technologies  tested  and/or  developed  use  NASA  research,
data sets, or subject matter experts, and are integrated with curriculum support and
teacher enhancement activities.
e-Education  Small  Programs  develop  infrastructure  and  deploy  research-based
technology  applications,  products,  and  services  to  enhance  the  educational  process
for  formal  and  informal  education.  An  emphasis  is  implementation  of  educational
product  development,  review,  and  meta-tagging  processes  and  final  distribution
through approved media, electronic, and/or site-based channels.

Informal Education
NASA  Explorer  Institutes  engage  the  informal  education  community,  provide  in-
structional materials and resources using NASA content for use at their home insti-
tutions,  and  serve  as  professional  development  opportunities  for  informal  education
professionals across the Nation.

Minority University Research and Education
University  Research  Centers  provide  a  broad-based,  competitive  NASA-related
research  capability  among  the  Nation’s  Minority  Institutions  (MI)  that  foster  new
aerospace  science  and  technology  concepts;  expand  the  Nation’s  base  for  aerospace
research  and  development;  develop  mechanisms  for  increased  participation  by  fac-
ulty and students of MI in mainstream research; and increase the production of U.S.
citizens who have historically been under-represented in NASA-related research and
in obtaining advanced degrees in STEM disciplines.

Faculty  Awards  for  Research  provides  faculty  at  MI  with  an  opportunity  early
in their academic careers, to integrate the research and education components with
the unique mission requirements of a specific NASA Center. By involving MI faculty
and students, the Agency strives to increase the interest and participation of tradi-
tionally under-represented students in NASA research programs.
Curriculum Improvement Partnership Award, a three-year undergraduate cur-
riculum  improvement  program  for  MI,  including  Historically  Black  Colleges  and
Universities,  Hispanic  Serving  Institutions,  Tribal  Colleges  and  Universities,  and
other  MI,  emphasizes  improvements  that  are  directly  related  to  the  NASA  mission
by infusing innovative learning experiences in STEM into the curriculum.
Research  Academy  provides  leading-edge  research  opportunities  for  faculty  and
students  from  MI  that  complements  NASA’s  research  programs  and  make  original
contributions  to  NASA  in  astrobiology,  biotechnology,  information  technology,  and
nanotechnology.  Faculty  and  students  from  MI  collaborate  with  the  scientists  at
NASA’s  Ames  Research  Center,  industry,  academia  and  nonprofit  organizations  on
research that helps prepare the next generation of explorers for NASA missions.
Jenkins  Graduate  Fellowship  Program  provides  support  for  under-represented
and  under-served  students  in  STEM  disciplines,  including  women,  minorities,  and
those  with  disabilities  who  seek  advanced  degrees  and  opportunities  for  NASA-re-
lated  research.  The  ultimate  goal  is  to  facilitate  the  development  of  a  more  inclu-
sive, multicultural and sustainable STEM workforce.
Tribal  College  and  University  Program  responds  to  Executive  Order  13270,
Tribal  Colleges  and  Universities  (TCUs),  which  directs  federal  agencies  to  provide
support  to  Tribal  College  faculty  and  students.  NASA  partners  with  TCUs  to  in-
crease  student  and  faculty  involvement  in  the  excitement  of  space  exploration  and
cutting-edge technology. The partnership enhances the capacity of TCUs to compete
for federal grants and other resources, and provides high-quality educational oppor-
tunities to Native American students and faculty.
NASA  Administrator’s  Fellowship  Program  seeks  to  increase  the  ability  of  Mi-
nority Universities to respond to NASA’s overall research and development mission.
To  that  goal,  NASA  Employees  spend  a  year  visiting  faculty/administrators  at  mi-
nority institutions and members of minority institutions STEM faculty spend a year
conducting research at a NASA Center.
MUREP Small Programs support a variety of opportunities for students, teachers,
faculty  and  researchers  from  under-represented  and  under-served  communities  in
NASA-related STEM fields.

Additionally,  NASA’s  Offices  of  Exploration  Systems,  Science,  Aeronautics,  Space
Operations  and  other  HQ  organizations  fund  education  efforts  or  embed  education
components  into  their  research  and  development  programs  and  flight  missions,  for
administering  the  discipline/content-specific  activities  for  ensuring  meaningful  col-
laboration  between  the  NASA  science/engineering  community  and  the  education
community.

Accordingly,  NASA  is  committed  to  providing  opportunities  for  all  children  to  ex-
plore  and  develop  their  full  learning  potential.  We  will  continue  to  support  our  na-
tion’s  elementary  and  secondary  schools,  universities,  colleges  and  community  col-
leges by providing exciting research and internship opportunities that will ‘‘light the
fire’’ and ‘‘fuel the passion’’ for a new culture of learning and achievement in STEM
education.

Career Development

NASA’s  Agency-level  training  investment  for  FY  2005  was  $10.2  million,  which
included training and development activities such as residential training programs,
developmental programs, leadership classes, fellowships, and coaching services. The
amount budgeted for similar efforts in FY 2006 is approximately $9.2 million. In ad-
dition, NASA also funds career development through their Centers’ training and de-
velopment activities.

Questions submitted by Representative Michael M. Honda
Q1. On September 14, the Ames Federal Employee Union sent you a letter describing
their  concerns  about  the  then  pending  cancellation  of  Space  Life  Sciences  and
the associated concerns about astronaut health and safety. They have made sev-
eral  unsuccessful  attempts  to  get  an  answer  from  NASA  HQ.  Will  you  answer
their letter? If so, when? not, why?

Q2. What Life Science expert advice, either in-house or external, did you seek before
making  your  decision  to  terminate  NASA’s  Space  Life  Sciences  program?  What
was  the  recommendation  of  the  Chief  Medical  Officer?  What  was  the  rec-
ommendation  of  academic  Life  Science  experts?  What  was  the  recommendation
of your in-house Life Science experts?

A2. The  Human  Research  program  content,  including  biomedical  and  fundamental
biology  research  tasks,  has  undergone  a  series  of  internal  and  external  reviews  in
recent  years.  The  non-NASA  community  of  researchers  performed  a  major  content
review  of  the  Exploration  System  Mission  Directorate’s  (ESMD)  research  priorities
during  the  Research  Maximization  and  Prioritization  Task  Force  (ReMap)  in  2002,
and provided comprehensive rankings and recommendations at that time. Beginning
in the fall of 2004 and concluding in early 2005, ESMD conducted a Zero Based Re-
view  (ZBR)  of  the  Human  Systems  Research  &  Technology  (HSRT)  research  port-
folio. The ZBR was conducted in order to reprioritize HSRT research to support the
VSE, following the merger of Exploration with Biological and Physical Research. All
900  research  tasks  were  collected  and  subdivided,  rated  with  weighting  factors  and
criteria  for  exploration-relevant  research,  and  a  series  of  non-advocate  panels  then
examined  ESMD’s  ZBR  process.  As  a  result  of  the  ZBR,  research  not  directly  sup-
porting  exploration  priorities  was  shifted  to  a  longer-term  ranking  within  ESMD,
much  of  which  was  targeted  to  be  gradually  phased  out  of  the  program.  The  ZBR
created a research baseline that was the focus of the Exploration Systems Architec-
ture Study (ESAS). The ESAS Technology Assessment Report is a further narrowing
of the ZBR priorities to very specific requirements emphasizing near-term needs for
a  return  to  the  Moon.  After  ESAS,  ESMD  also  emphasized  the  need  to  maximize
use of the International Space Station to perform research needed for Mars mission
risk  reduction.  The  priorities  resulting  from  the  ESAS  studies  were  then  reviewed
by  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Health  and  Medical  Officer,  specifically  to  ensure  these
ESAS  recommendations  did  not  result  in  compromise  to  crew  health  and  safety  in
near-term  missions  or  in  proposed  mission  architectures,  through  six-month  lunar
stay.
Q3. In your testimony, you said: ‘‘The human life science research of which you spoke
is  there  to  support  human  exploration.  It  seemed  to  me  that  it  was  getting  the
cart before the horse to be worrying about money for human or other life sciences
when  we  could  not  assure  ourselves  the  continued  capability  to  be  able  to  place
people in orbit in the first place. So my priority became assuring that the United
States  would  have  as  close  to  continuous  capability  to  put  people  in  space  first
and then conducting the research on them after that.’’
• After the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, as part of NASA HQ’s pain-
ful  rehabilitation  from  the  Board  finding  that  NASA’s  management  culture
was  a  primary  contributor  to  the  disaster,  the  Administrator  made  a  commit-
ment  to  put  astronaut  safety  first.  How  is  your  answer  consistent  with  that
pledge  made  by  your  predecessor  only  a  few  short  years  ago?  You  appear  to
be saying that the safety cart must go after the mission horse and that NASA
needs  to  get  astronauts  back  to  Space  and  the  Moon  first  and  then  determine
the risks to their health and safety second. Would you care to respond?

A3. As a result of the Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS), the Human
Research  Program  will  have  a  reduced  and  clearly  focused  scope.  The  Human  Re-
search  Program  will  focus  on  near-term  Agency  goals  of  supporting  Crew  Explo-
ration  Vehicle  (CEV)  and  lunar  mission  requirements  by  developing  counter-
measures to meet, and knowledge to inform, the Office of the Chief Health and Med-
ical Officer (OCHMO) Space Flight Health and Human Performance Standards. The
budget and content for Human Research that were recommended by ESAS was fur-
ther  reviewed  by  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Health  and  Medical  Officer,  specifically  to
ensure  these  ESAS  recommendations  did  not  result  in  compromise  to  crew  health
and safety in near-term missions or in proposed mission architectures, through six-
month lunar stays.

Human  health  and  performance  issues  are  only  a  small  portion  of  the  risk  to  as-
tronauts. The active portions of space missions, launch, rendezvous, entry and land-
ing,  present  tremendous  risks  to  the  lives  of  astronauts  that  are  extremely  signifi-
cant.  We  have  had  a  long  history  of  successful  space  missions  both  in  low-Earth
orbit and on the lunar surface. U.S. astronauts routinely stay in space for up to six
months  without  demonstrable,  permanent  short-term  untoward  health  effects  upon
return. Possible long-term health effects are still being evaluated through the Longi-
tudinal  Study  of  Astronaut  Health.  We  have  lost  our  crew  members  during  launch
and during entry. We must ensure that they have a safer method of transportation

from  Earth  to  space.  That  is  one  reason  why  we  are  investing  in  the  CEV,  a  safer
replacement for the Space Shuttle.
Q4. NASA HQ appears to have decided that an Apollo-like return to the Moon poses
no  risks  related  to  human  health  and  performance.  What  risk  assessment  was
performed to support this view? How can the handful of successful Apollo Moon
missions (with one mechanical failure) allow HQ to determine that there is little
risk of a catastrophic human error or health crisis in short-duration lunar mis-
sions?

A4. No  mission  in  space  is  without  risk,  whether  that  mission  is  a  short  duration
Shuttle mission, a long duration International Space Station (ISS) mission, or a mis-
sion  to  the  lunar  surface.  The  risk  and  reliability  assessment  of  the  ESAS  was  an
integral element of the architectural design process. It should be noted that the cho-
sen ESAS architecture has a higher ascent crew safety (approximately one in 2,000
risk  for  loss  of  crew)  than  that  of  the  Space  Shuttle  (one  in  220  loss  of  crew).  In
general,  the  risk  of  loss  of  mission  decreases  with  the  maturation  of  key  tech-
nologies.

The  biomedical  operations  and  research  community  has  been  and  is  involved  in
supporting the U.S. and international human element of every major NASA human
space flight program, including Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, Apollo-Soyuz Test
Project, Shuttle, Spacelab, NASA/Mir, and ISS. As of October 2005:

• Persons who have flown in orbit: 437
• 28,421 crew-days (77.5 years)
• Shuttle (1981–2005)—6,352 crew-days (17 years)
• Skylab (1973–1974)—504 crew-days (1.4 years)
• NASA/Mir (1994–1998)—849 crew-days (2.3 years)

As  a  result  of  this  extensive  experience,  it  is  known  that  medical,  environmental
and  human  error  events  do  happen.  Failures  in  countermeasures  and  monitoring
equipment  lead  to  an  increased  likelihood  of  adverse  events,  but  there  are  also
tradeoffs  between  the  medical  level  of  care  and  other  mission  constraints.  Explo-
ration  requires  a  focused  human  health  and  safety  research  and  operations  pro-
gram.  Therefore,  the  Human  Research  Program  has  been  tasked  with  building  on
this  long  history  of  involvement  in  human  space  flight  and  the  resulting  body  of
knowledge  to  develop  the  countermeasures,  tools,  knowledge  and  capabilities  nec-
essary  to  ensure  the  safety  and  health  of  our  crews  returning  to  the  Moon.  The
Human  Research  Program  will  work  actively  with  office  of  the  Chief  Health  and
Medical  Officer,  the  Office  of  Safety  and  Mission  Assurance,  the  National  Acad-
emies, academia, and the Astronaut Office to assure that all aspect of human health
and performance are considered as we prepare for a return to the Moon.
Q5. In  Dr.  Porter’s  initial  plan  to  totally  revamp  NASA’s  aeronautics  R&D  pro-
grams, she decided to make large cuts in key Aviation Human Factors programs
(in  both  the  Airspace  Systems  and  Aviation  Safety  programs).  Human  perform-
ance capabilities and limitations play a key role in the design of modern human-
automation  systems  either  on  the  flight  deck  or  for  air  traffic  management.  Ex-
perts in the field of automation and human performance emphasize that relying
on technology and automation per se to prevent accidents will not work and may
even introduce new serious risks.
• Given  that  advancing  human-centered  design  and  related  technologies  will  be
a  key  element  in  any  effective  reduction  in  commercial  aviation  accidents  or
increase in efficiency, in what way will NASA’s new R&D portfolio support ac-
tivities in Human-System Interactions?
• Given  that  human  performance  has  been  identified  as  a  major  factor  in  the
great  majority  of  aviation  accidents  by  every  major  study  published,  why  are
human  performance  issues  subordinated  to  hardware/software  technology  de-
velopment in the new Aviation Safety and Airspace systems programs?

A5. Within the Aviation Safety Program, research focused on Human-System Inter-
actions  will  be  part  of  the  Integrated  Intelligent  Flight  Deck  (IIFD)  Technologies
thrust  area  currently  being  planned.  A  ten-year  roadmap  for  integrated  multi-dis-
ciplinary  research  has  been  developed  that  captures  the  breadth  of  research  needs
for  improved  flight  deck  system  safety.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  research
agenda considers the notion of a flight deck system wherein one or more human op-
erators are elements of this system. This acknowledges the fact that the act of safely
directing a flight in current and future operational environments requires a complex
system  whose  behavior  will  result  from  a  strong  coupling  of  physical  processes,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:19 May 22, 2006 Jkt 024151 PO 00000 Frm 00099 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\110305\24151 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

96

human  behavior,  and  computer-controlled  systems.  As  a  result,  an  overarching
guideline  is  promoted  to  apply  an  integrated  holistic  approach  in  order  to  bring
about  new  system-level  capabilities,  such  as  those  envisioned  by  the  NGATS,  while
simultaneously improving safety.

Because human behavior is a critical element that has been shown to have a sig-
nificant  impact  on  the  performance/safety  of  flight  deck  systems,  the  study  of
human  factors  issues  is  also  essential.  However,  the  study  of  human  factors  must
be  focused  or  applied  to  the  functional  capabilities  required  by  future  flight  deck
and  operational  environments.  The  research  portfolio  that  has  been  defined  con-
siders  human  factors  in  a  manner  similar  to  other  important  disciplines  such  as
computer science, physics, and systems engineering. Each of these fundamental dis-
ciplines  and  others  will  be  drawn  upon  as  appropriate  in  the  research  to  address
safety issues associated with required functional capabilities.

The  ten-year  roadmap  of  research  milestones  was  developed  by  a  group  of  senior
NASA  researchers  that  included  several  human  factors  specialists  who  have  been
applying human factors tenets to aviation problems for many years. As a result, evi-
dence of human factors-related research activities can be found throughout the envi-
sioned  effort.  Perhaps  the  most  important  example  is  cited  in  the  recurring  mile-
stone to develop/refine model-based flight deck design tools that can be reconfigured
to accommodate changes in system hardware/software, user characteristics, and en-
vironmental conditions while also accommodating human-centered designs.

Human  error  has  been  consistently  sited  as  a  major  factor  to  the  cause  of  many
aircraft accidents (about 60–80 percent). Although the planning is still ongoing, and
we  will  be  doing  less  research  in  some  areas,  human  performance  issues  have  not
been  subordinated  to  other  technologies.  As  described  above,  we  see  the  need  for  a
multi-disciplinary holistic approach due to the strong coupling of human operator(s)
behavior and performance with computer-based systems and physical processes that
affect  the  flight  and/or  measurements  made  by  on-board  sensors.  None  of  these
three disciplines are viewed more or less significant than the others.

In  addition,  human-systems  integration  and  adaptation  and  the  related  human
performance  factors  have  been  included  in  the  planning  for  foundational  research
investment in the Airspace Systems Program. Foundational research is not subordi-
nate  but  rather  critical  to  the  long-term  success  of  integrated  system  solutions.  Se-
lected  principal  investigators  will  work  within  the  Airspace  System  Program  and
across  all  Aeronautics  programs  over  the  next  several  months  to  define  further  the
specific human factors research elements to be included in the programs.

The  draft  milestone  charts  and  schedules  for  all  the  Aeronautics  planning  activi-
ties  are  available  at  www.aeronautics.nasa.gov  and  were  presented  to  the  public  at
the  AIAA  Conference  on  January  12,  2006.  The  portfolio  of  proposed  activities  are
still  under  development  at  the  NASA  Research  Centers  and  will  be  implemented
after  first  being  peer  reviewed  by  non-NASA,  and  non-ARMD  representatives  for
technical accuracy and relevance.
Q6. NASA  asserted  in  its  responses  to  OMB  questions  that  ‘‘For  commercial  trans-
ports,  system  and  component  failures  were  a  causal  factor  in  approximately  70
percent of aircraft incidents.’’

Q6a. Please provide the NTSB data and analysis used to support this assertion.
A6a. The NTSB maintains the Accident/Incident Database, the government’s official
repository  of  aviation  accident  data  and  causal  factors  for  civil  aviation  accidents.
The  database  was  established  in  1962  by  the  NTSB’s  predecessor  agency,  the  Civil
Aeronautics  Board,  and  about  2,000  new  events  records  are  added  each  year.  The
record for each aviation accident contains data about the aircraft, environment, inju-
ries, sequence of accident events, and other topics. The database is available to the
public at ×ftp://www.ntsb.gov/avdata/>. The time frames used for the NASA anal-
ysis were incidents recorded from 1990 to 1996, involving Part 121 & 135 Scheduled
Flights.  For  these  categories,  there  were  about  5,500  incidents  noted  and  of  those
3800  (∼70  percent)  involved  a  system  malfunction,  propulsion  malfunction,  landing
gear failure, or loss of directional control.
Q6b. What is meant by ‘‘incident’’ in this assertion? Why did NASA look at incidents
rather than accidents when developing its safety policy? Is not NASA’s mission
in  Aviation  Safety  to  reduce  accidents  and  dangerous  close-calls  that  threaten
the flying public not minor incidents?

A6b. An ‘‘accident’’ is defined in 49 CFR Part 830.2 as—

‘‘An  occurrence  associated  with  the  operation  of  an  aircraft  which  takes  place
between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:19 May 22, 2006 Jkt 024151 PO 00000 Frm 00100 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\110305\24151 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

97

all  such  persons  have  disembarked,  and  in  which  any  person  suffers  death  or
serious injury, or in which the aircraft received substantial damage.’’

An ‘‘incident’’ is defined in 49 CFR Part 830.2 as—

‘‘An  occurrence  other  than  an  accident,  associated  with  the  operation  of  an  air-
craft, which affects or could affect the safety of operations.’’

In  the  case  of  most  accident  findings,  the  accident  was  a  result  of  two  or  more
faults and/or errors that aligned together in a deadly sequence that led up to a cata-
strophic event. Given, an accident is a rare event, a pro-active approach to accident
prevention  is  to  identify  and  eliminate  any  systemic  faults  before  they  ever  come
together as an accident. An assessment of incident data is a primary means of iden-
tifying  faults  currently  in  the  air  transportation  system  that  could  some  day  be  a
contributing factor to the cause of a fatal accident.
Q7. In  what  way  did  NASA  consult  with  the  aviation  industry  (including  operators
and manufacturers) in choosing the major program elements for each of its three
aeronautics  programs?  Did  NASA  consult  with  its  own  experts  on  the  causes  of
aviation accidents? Has NASA consulted industry organizations such as the Air-
line  Transport  Association,  the  Airline  Pilots  Association,  and  the  Flight  Safety
Foundation?  What  do  these  industry  organizations  say  about  what  they  need
from NASA to improve safety and to improve U.S. competitiveness?

A7. At  the  beginning  of  the  first  focused  Safety  Program  in  1997,  NASA  sponsored
a  series  of  workshops  with  industry  and  government  participants  to  identify  and
prioritize  NASA’s  portfolio  of  safety  research  activities  that  would  support  the  Na-
tional Goal to reduce the fatal accident rate. As the second phase of the Safety pro-
gram was being planned in 2004, NASA conducted another workshop with industry
and  government  participation  to  refine  and  prioritize  NASA’s  portfolio  of  proposed
Safety research activities. In addition to NASA’s own expertise, participation at both
workshops  included  representatives  from  ATA,  Boeing,  the  airlines,  avionics  sup-
pliers, the FAA, and other government agencies. Even though the current planning
reflects  a  shift  to  more  fundamental  research,  previous  findings  of  the  safety  work-
shops influenced establishment of the Integrated Intelligent Flight Deck and the In-
tegrated  Resilient  Aircraft  Control  thrust  areas.  Furthermore,  NASA  issued  a  Re-
quest for Information (RFI) on January 3rd to solicit input from industry to include
interest  in  collaborative  non-reimbursable  partnerships  in  the  proposed  research
areas.  Responses  to  the  RFI  were  due  January  31,  and  for  the  Safety  Program  we
received  input  from  a  least  35  industry  organizations  expressing  an  interest  to  col-
laborate.

The Airspace Systems Program (and its partner programs in NASA’s Aeronautics
Research Mission Directorate) is seeking partnership with industry to further define
and  collaborate  on  systems  level  technologies.  These  pre-competitive  consortia  will
support the long-term goals of the program. In addition, the relevant vision for ASP
(that  of  the  JPDO  NGATS  2025)  was  developed  at  its  earliest  stages  with  substan-
tial aviation industry input.

The  initial  formulation  of  the  Fundamental  Aeronautics  Program  used  in-house
expertise  to  identify  aeronautics  challenges  within  the  areas  of  hypersonics,  super-
sonics, and subsonics. This expertise draws its knowledge base from the foundation
developed  via  long  standing  partnerships  within  the  aviation  industry.  Now  in  the
second  phase  of  formulation,  Fundamental  Aeronautics  released  an  RFI  soliciting
interest  primarily  from  industry  to  collaborate  at  the  systems  level.  The  RFI  gen-
erated  over  140  responses.  The  collaborations  are  expected  to  benefit  both  industry
and NASA.
Q8. What  link  is  there  between  NASA’s  new  aeronautics  plan  and  the  analyses  of
aviation safety made over the years, e.g., Boeing’s annual reports on commercial
aviation  accidents,  JSAT,  CAST,  the  Gore  Commission,  NTSB  Safety  Studies?
How  do  the  new  thrusts  proposed  for  NASA’s  aviation  safety  program  address
industry’s safety concerns?

A8. As  implied  in  the  response  to  Question  7,  NASA  has  collaborated  with  Boeing
and other external organizations as it planned for and implemented previous Safety
Programs. The first Safety Program, initiated in 1997, was directly tied to the find-
ings of the Gore Commission which set a National Goal to reduce the fatal accident
rate  by  80  percent.  In  addition,  the  NASA  Aviation  Safety  Program  Director  is  a
member  of  the  Executive  Committee  of  the  Commercial  Aviation  Safety  Team
(CAST),  and  NASA  representatives  have  participated  on  the  Joint  Safety  Analysis
Teams  that  directly  report  to  the  CAST.  FAA  representatives  from  the  CAST  have
been  asked  and  have  agreed  to  review  and  comment  on  the  research  activities  cur-
rently being planned in the Aviation Safety thrust areas.

Q9. Why  has  NASA  excluded  Human  Factors  issues  from  many  of  the  new  Aero-
nautics program elements? For example, it is not possible to design aircraft com-
puters to automatically recover from upset attitudes without including crew per-
formance  as  a  central  issue,  yet  the  crew  performance  issues  are  excluded  from
the new Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control program element. Another example
is  that  has  NASA  has  excluded  Human  Factors  issues  related  to  operating  pro-
cedures,  maintenance,  and  training  from  its  Aging  Aircraft  program  element
even  though  these  issues  have  been  identified  by  Boeing  as  a  major  concern
when second and third tier airline operators with limited resources acquire older
aircraft? Why is Human Factors not considered a fundamental element of aero-
nautics  R&D  that  cuts  across  vehicle  classes  (subsonic,  rotorcraft,  supersonic,
hypersonic) and Air Traffic management?

the 

A9. As  stated  in  response  to  Question  5,  human  performance  issues  have  not  been
subordinated  to  other  technologies  nor  have  they  been  fully  excluded,  although  we
will be doing less in some areas. The planning is still underway, and we are taking
a  more  holistic  approach  across  all  technology  disciplines  to  include  a  more  inte-
grated approach across the program thrust areas. Human performance research re-
quirements  will  not  be  isolated  to  within  each  thrust  area.  For  example,  require-
ments identified for the automation, autonomy, and crew interface issues of the In-
tegrated  Resilient  Aircraft  Control  (IRAC)  are  intended  to  be  addressed  in  the
human performance activities of the Integrated Intelligent Flight Deck (IIFD) thrust
area. Accordingly, the IRAC planning team has a Crew Systems Specialist assigned
to  their  team  to  ensure  that  human  factors  issues  are  addressed  and  coordinated
with 
at
IIFD.  The 
www.aeronautics.nasa.gov.

Human Factors issues have been explicitly included in the Airspace Systems Pro-
gram at its most fundamental levels as a result of the technical workshop planning
conducted by NASA’s research community. Selected principal investigators will work
within  the  Airspace  System  Program  and  across  all  Aeronautics  programs  over  the
next  several  months  to  further  define  the  specific  human  factors  research  elements
to be included in the programs.

In  Fundamental  Aeronautics,  we  have  made  a  commitment  to  the  technologies
that  constitute  advanced  guidance,  navigation,  and  control.  Therefore  we  are  inte-
grating  human  factors  research  in  situations  where  it  makes  sense.  Given  that  the
likelihood of a human-piloted hypersonic vehicle is low, we see little need for human
factors  work  in  hypersonics.  On  the  other  hand,  human  factors  research  plays  a
first-order role in the control of rotorcraft, and we are integrating human factors re-
search  into  that  area  of  the  program.  In  short,  we  continue  to  work  human  factors
research in areas where it is important.

Questions submitted Representative Sheila Jackson Lee
Q1. Funding-wise, the Administration will face a crisis in terms of its workforce. The
way  that  the  request  is  structured,  the  number  of  full-time  equivalents  (FTEs)
will be reduced from 19,227 in FY 2005 to 16,738 by the end of FY 2006.
• How  do  you  propose  the  Administration  will  maximize  efficiencies  in  tech-

nology with such a drastic reduction in workforce?

• Is  one  official  charged  with  the  duty  of  deciding  whom  to  release  pursuant  to

the plan to reduce the workforce?

A1. The recently released President’s FY 2007 Budget reflects the current situation
and  shows  the  actual  FTE  used  in  FY  2005  of  18,624,  and  estimates  FY  2006  FTE
at  18,410  and  FY  2007  FTE  at  17,979.  The  reasons  for  the  change  from  the  Presi-
dent’s FY 2006 Budget is that Administrator Griffin has made a decision to restore
and ensure NASA’s core intellectual capabilities now and into the future. The Agen-
cy  is  determined  to  find  ways  to  preserve  and  maintain  the  knowledge  base  of  the
current workforce, broaden and reinvigorate current skills and acquire new ones as
they are needed. Successful accomplishment of the NASA mission requires ten fully
engaged  and  productive  field  Centers.  NASA  is  committed  to  ensuring  the  vitality
of  these  Centers,  each  with  a  clear  mission,  a  role  in  making  the  Vision  a  reality,
and sufficient funding and workload to sustain its workforce.

As  a  result  of  the  NASA  Administrator’s  decisions  stated  above,  the  President’s
FY  2007  Budget  for  FY  2007  of  17,979  FTE  is  now  1,241  FTE  higher  than  the  FY
2006 President’s Budget submission for FY 2007 of 16,738 FTE.

Q2. Relative to space exploration, the Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission com-
mitment  seems  tenuous.  What  is  the  Administration’s  plan  with  regard  to
Hubble?

A2. The  Hubble  Space  Telescope  Program  is  continuing  to  prepare  plans  for  a  pos-
sible  Hubble  servicing  mission  in  early  FY  2008.  The  decision  to  proceed  with  a
servicing  mission  will  not  be  made  until  after  the  Space  Shuttle’s  2nd  Return-to-
Flight mission. The FY 2007 budget supports this servicing mission.
Q3. At  your  April  2005  confirmation  hearing,  you  indicated  that  ‘‘the  total  amount
of  NASA  funding  is  not  the  problem,  NASA  received  approximately  the  same
amount  of  money  in  its  fast  16  years  as  it  has  in  the  past  16  years.  In-
stead. . .it is a matter of setting priorities.’’ Your chief priorities as enumerated
were  returning  the  Shuttle  to  flight  and  making  each  flight  as  safe  as  possible,
completing construction of the space station by 2010, terminating the Shuttle in
2010, and accelerating the development of the CEV to minimize the gap between
when  the  Shuttle  ends  and  the  CEV  is  available.  Where  will  you  make  cuts  to
meet  these  goals  given  the  funding  levels  contained  in  the  SSJC  Appropriations
Act for FY 2006?

A3. NASA’s FY 2007 budget request includes the resources necessary to address the
priorities  of  the  President  and  the  Congress,  including  completing  assembly  of  the
Space  Station  and  fulfilling  our  commitment  to  our  international  partners,  retiring
the  Space  Shuttle  by  2010,  and  bringing  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  online  in  a
timely  manner,  not  later  than  2014  and  potentially  much  sooner.  This  budget  re-
quest for Space Operations (including Space Shuttle and Space Station) is based on
credible estimates of Space Shuttle retirement and transition costs and is no longer
a placeholder budget as it was in previous budget requests.

In previous budget requests, NASA reported only placeholder budget estimates for
the  Space  Shuttle  for  FY  2008–10.  The  Agency’s  management  focus  on  return-to-
flight efforts of the Space Shuttle resulted in NASA deferring this analysis until the
FY 2007 budget. Early in the budget process, NASA’s estimates of the budget short-
fall  required  to  safely  fly  the  Space  Shuttle  with  the  minimum  number  of  flights
necessary  to  complete  ISS  assembly  and  meet  our  international  partner  commit-
ments  were  $3–5  billion.  With  the  FY  2007  budget  runout,  NASA  has  added  $2.4
billion  to  the  Space  Shuttle  program  and  almost  $1.5  billion  to  the  International
Space  Station  in  FY  2008–10  compared  to  the  FY  2006  budget  runout.  There  is  no
‘‘new  money’’  for  the  NASA  topline  budget  within  the  budget  projections  available
given  our  nation’s  other  pressing  issues,  so  working  with  the  White  House,  NASA
provided sufficient funds for the Space Shuttle and ISS programs to carry out their
missions  by  redirecting  funds  from  the  Science  (about  $2.4  billion)  and  Exploration
(about $1.4 billion) budgets.

With regard to ensuring timely development of the CEV, the Exploration Systems
Mission  Directorate  (ESMD)  has  redirected  funds  within  its  overall  budget,  from
longer-term and lower-priority technology activities into the Constellation budget for
development  of  the  CEV  and  its  launch  system.  This  shift  of  funding  internal  to
ESMD  reflects  the  results  of  the  Exploration  Systems  Architecture  Study  (ESAS),
and  is  consistent  with  notifications  provided  to  the  Congress  in  the  September  30,
2005, update to the FY 2005 Operating Plan.

Question submitted by Representative Brian Baird
Q1. With  NASA  placing  its  top  priority  on  programs  like  the  Space  Shuttle,  the
International  Space  Station,  development  of  the  new  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle,
and development of a new heavy-lift launch vehicle, what are your plans for the
Earth Science program, and what priority will they have relative to the Agency’s
other missions?

A1. As  outlined  in  the  2006  NASA  Strategic  Plan,  it  is  a  strategic  goal  of  NASA
to study the Earth from space so as to advance scientific understanding of our plan-
et  and  its  dynamic  processes  and  also  to  meet  vital  societal  needs.  NASA  will  con-
duct  a  robust  program  of  utilization  of  the  current  Earth  science  space  assets  and
databases. This includes such things as the operation of the Earth Observation Sat-
ellite  system,  which  is  the  world’s  most  sophisticated  tool  for  measuring,  docu-
menting,  and  conducting  research  on  weather  processes  and  climate  change.
Through  interagency  activities  with  the  Department  of  Defense,  National  Science
Foundation  and  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  this  research
will  be  used  to  improve  predictive  capabilities  for  weather  and  climate  models  for
national  economic  benefit.  This  budget  provides  for  extended  operations  for  many

of these missions in order to benefit from the additional scientific insights that these
missions continue to offer.

NASA  will  also  operate  a  fleet  of  scientific  satellites  in  extended  mission  status
to  develop  and  communicate  new  scientific  knowledge  concerning  the  Earth  and  its
processes. Looking forward, the Earth Sciences Division is currently developing nine
new  missions  for  future  scientific  investigations.  These  include  Cloudsat  and
CALIPSO,  OCO  and  Aquarius,  Glory,  the  Global  Precipitation  Measurement  Mis-
sion,  the  Ocean  Surface  Topography  Mission,  the  National  Polar-Orbiting  Oper-
ational  Satellite  System  Preparatory  Project  satellite,  and  in  collaboration  with  the
US Geological Survey, a Landsat mission to secure land data from space.

Thus,  the  Earth  Science  program  within  the  SMD  is  a  vital  part  of  the  Agency’s
science portfolio, currently configured and funded to make significant cultural, intel-
lectual, economic and political contributions to the Nation.
