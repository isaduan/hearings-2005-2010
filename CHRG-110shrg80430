NOMINATIONS  TO  THE 

BOARD  OF  DIRECTORS  OF  THE 

CORPORATION  FOR  PUBLIC  BROADCASTING 

WEDNESDAY,  SEPTEMBER  17,  2008 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10:30  a.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Daniel  K.  Inouye, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Good  morning.  This  morning,  we  hold  a  hearing 
with the five nominees for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting 
Board of Directors. 

And  I  am  especially  pleased  to  welcome  our  friend  and  former 
colleague  David  Pryor  back  to  the  U.S.  Senate,  at  least  electroni-
cally. 

Since  its  creation  in  the  1967  Public  Broadcasting  Act,  public 
broadcasting  has  become  a  unique  voice  in  our  local  communities. 
Public  broadcasting  has  provided  educational,  cultural,  and  infor-
mational  programming  that  takes  creative  risks  and  serves  tradi-
tionally unserved and underserved populations. 

Public broadcasting has become a forum for award-winning docu-
mentaries, outstanding children’s programming, and in-depth news 
and  public  affairs  programming  that  is  not  always  found  on  com-
mercial stations. 

As  you  may  be  aware,  I  am  a  long-time  supporter  of  public 
broadcasting.  So  I  was  very  troubled  when  only  a  few  years  ago, 
the  Inspector  General  of  the  Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting 
found  that  actions  of  the  former  Chairman  of  the  Board  had  vio-
lated  the  Public  Broadcasting  Act  of  1967  as  well  as  the  Director’s 
Code  of  Ethics.  Though  this  dark  episode  is  behind  us,  it  cast  an 
unfortunate shadow. 

The  nominees  for  the  Board  must  understand  that  they  occupy 
a position of public trust. So, on behalf of the Committee, I ask all 
of you to commit to the success of public broadcasting and work to 
ensure that the future is bright. 

This  challenge  is  especially  acute  for  public  television  stations 
because  only  5  months  from  today,  this  nation  will  transform— 
transition  from  analog  to  digital  signals.  As  Board  members,  you

will  bear  responsibilities  for  the  digital  transition  and  be  expected 
to help ensure success. 

I would like to now call upon the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nel-

son, for his remarks. 

STATEMENT OF HON. BILL NELSON, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA 

Senator NELSON. Mr. Chairman, thank you. 
And  I  want  to  say  a  word  about  David  Pryor  and  Liz  Sembler. 
And  David,  you  are  joining  us  by  teleconference.  We  all  know  the 
enormous  contributions  that  you  have  made  to  your  country.  But 
perhaps  the  greatest  contribution  that  you  have  made  is  that  you 
have  sent  us  your  son,  Mark  Pryor,  who  is  our  colleague  here  in 
the  Senate  and  one  of  my  dearest  personal  friends  in  the  Senate. 
So thank you very much for that. 

Senator DAVID PRYOR. Thank you, sir. 
Senator NELSON. Mr. Chairman, I want to introduce to the Com-
mittee,  Liz  Sembler,  who  has  been  nominated  to  serve  on  this 
board. 

For over 15 years, she has been deeply involved in the efforts to 
support public broadcasting, and she has done that in Florida, and 
throughout  the  country.  She  has  served  on  the  board  of  directors 
of  WEDU,  which  is  the  public  broadcasting  station  in  the  Tampa 
Bay  area.  And  during  that  time,  she  has  been  involved  in  what 
each of those public broadcasting stations has to do, which includes 
raising  money  and  doing  community  outreach,  as  well  as  the  sta-
tion’s  efforts  to  prepare  for  the  transition  to  digital  television, 
which is going to occur next February. 

She  has  also  served  on  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Association 
of  Public  Television  Stations.  And  there,  she  worked  with  both 
sides of the aisle to ensure the continuation of support for the Cor-
poration for Public Broadcasting. 

I  want  to  point  out  that  she  is  an  educator.  And  as  we  look  at 
the  future  of  the  Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting,  it  is  to  en-
sure  that  public  broadcasters  across  the  country  provide  program-
ming  that  educates  and  inspires  the  children  of  America.  And  Ms. 
Sembler understands what we need to do to adapt this corporation 
to an Internet-based world. And so, I want to give my recommenda-
tion that we approve her. 

And Senator Pryor, just before you came, I had some opportunity 
to  comment  that  your  father’s  greatest  contribution  to  the  country 
is that he sent you here to the Senate. 

So, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for sharing these remarks. 
The CHAIRMAN. We have a lovefest here. 
[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  with  that  introduction,  I  would  like  to  call 
upon  the  first  nominee,  Ms.  Elizabeth  Sembler.  I  have  been  told 
that  you  have  family  members  here.  Would  you  like  to  introduce 
them?

STATEMENT OF ELIZABETH SEMBLER, 

MEMBER-DESIGNATE, BOARD OF DIRECTORS, 
CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING 

Ms.  SEMBLER.  Thank  you  very  much.  And  thank  you,  Senator 

Nelson, for your comments. 

I  have  sitting  behind  me  my  parents,  Ruth  and  Leonard  Mauer 
from  New  York.  And  it  is  my  father’s  77th  birthday  today.  So  this 
is very exciting that he is here. 

I have my husband, Greg Sembler, who is with me, and three of 
my  four  children—Jacob  Sembler,  Eve  Sembler,  and  Benjamin 
Sembler. 

The CHAIRMAN. Happy birthday, Father. Please proceed. 
Ms.  SEMBLER.  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Commerce 
Committee, thank you very much for the opportunity to appear be-
fore you this morning to discuss my nomination to the Board of Di-
rectors  for  the  Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting.  I  would  also 
like to thank President Bush for having confidence in me and hon-
oring me with this nomination. 

Fifteen  years  ago  this  month,  I  attended  my  first  board  meeting 
as a new member of the Board of Directors of WEDU, my local pub-
lic television station in Tampa, Florida. When I was asked to serve 
on  that  Board,  I  willingly  agreed.  As  a  viewer,  I  appreciated  the 
public  affairs  programming.  And  as  the  mom  of  three  very  young 
children  with  a  fourth  on  the  way,  I  was  dependent  upon  the  PBS 
show ‘‘Barney and Friends’’ for at least a half an hour of calm each 
morning during the reigning chaos. ‘‘Yes, of course, I will volunteer 
for  this  cause,’’  I  told  the  board  officer  who  recruited  me.  ‘‘I  love 
public television. I need public television. Doesn’t everyone?’’ 

Over  the  past  decade  and  a  half,  as  my  babies  have  grown  into 
the teenagers sitting before you today, so, too, has my awe for what 
our nation’s public broadcasters accomplish each and every day. 

I  have  witnessed  firsthand,  as  a  board  member  of  WEDU,  and 
later as its chairman, the masterfully coordinated efforts of station 
manager and producers, engineers and pledge drive VPs, Ready To 
Learn  outreach  directors  and  capital  campaign  fundraisers,  under-
writing salesmen and programmers, and, of course, volunteers and 
board members, all of whom work together to provide the finest tel-
evision broadcasts available in our country. Programming which, in 
my  opinion,  far  surpasses  the  offerings  available  on  any  other 
channel. 

The  more  I  learned  at  WEDU,  the  more  determined  I  became  to 
ensure  that  the  Federal  Government  continued  to  support  our  ef-
forts and continued to share the burden of our expenses. Year after 
year,  I  traveled  here  to  Washington  to  visit  you  and  your  col-
leagues  to  remind  you  of  the  value  of  this  national  asset  and  to 
convince reluctant supporters to step up and fund our efforts. 

In  the  process,  I  learned  about  the  Association  of  Public  Tele-
vision Stations and their efforts to organize us in our outreach, and 
they  learned  about  me.  Four  years  ago,  I  joined  their  national 
board  of  directors  and  now  work  with  the  finest  CEOs  and  station 
managers  from  around  the  country  to  help  educate  you,  the  Mem-
bers  of  Congress,  on  the  critical  issues  facing  the  public  television 
community.

And  as  I  know  you  are  aware,  there  are  critical  issues.  Perhaps 
looming  largest  is  the  February  17,  2009,  analog  shutoff  date  for 
television  broadcasts.  So  many  are  hard  at  work  to  ensure  smooth 
transition  to  digital  broadcasting,  yet  just  last  week,  the  FCC  re-
ported concerns in early testing in North Carolina. This is particu-
larly troubling for public TV broadcasters. 

Of  the  estimated  25  million  Americans  who  receive  their  tele-
vision programming over the air and who will need to do the most 
to  transition  to  digital  reception,  a  significant  number  are  sup-
porters  and  viewers  of  public  television.  The  CPB  and  its  stations 
must work hard with commercial broadcasters and Congress to en-
sure the success of the transition and ensure that the audience for 
public television can find its programming. 

There  are  other  critical  issues  for  public  broadcasters,  who  must 
now  compete  for  eyeballs  and  eardrums  in  an  era  of  channel  pro-
liferation and emerging media and distribution platforms. 

My children can send a text message on their phones while they 
listen  to  their  iPods,  surf  the  Web,  and  flip  back  and  forth  among 
several  television  shows  simultaneously.  Just  the  thought  of  it 
gives  me  a  headache,  but  this  young  generation  is  adept  and  so-
phisticated in its use of technology. It behooves us to keep up with 
their needs. 

Additionally,  public  broadcasters  must  face  these  challenges  and 
accomplish their goals in an era of Federal funding that, while now 
increasing, does not keep pace with inflation. It is, indeed, a critical 
time for CPB and the stations it supports. 

I  believe  that  my  background  will  prepare  me  well,  if  I  am  con-
firmed to serve on the CPB board, to help the Corporation meet the 
challenges  it  now  faces.  My  years  of  service  as  a  public  television 
station  board  member,  both  locally  and  on  the  APTS  board,  have 
provided  me  a  front-row  seat  in  the  arena.  I  am  continually  ex-
posed  to  the  flow  of  ideas  and  issues  in  the  world  of  public  broad-
casting, both television and radio. 

Also, I am a schoolteacher and administrator by profession. Edu-
cation continues to be a core value of the public broadcasting com-
munity.  Indeed,  the  CPB’s  mission  is  to  inform,  enlighten,  and  en-
rich the public. The Federal Act which created the Corporation spe-
cifically underscored the use of public media for instructional, edu-
cational, and cultural purposes. 

I  work  with  children  every  day  in  and  out  of  the  classroom,  and 
I  understand  the  transformative  power  of  education.  If  confirmed 
by  the  U.S.  Senate  to  serve  on  the  CPB  board,  I  will  draw  upon 
the  lessons  I  have  learned  from  my  classroom  teaching  and  from 
my  association  with  WEDU  and  APTS  to  help  me  make  informed 
and reasoned decisions. I look forward to the possibility. 

Thank you again for this opportunity to appear before you today. 

I am happy to answer any questions that you may have.

17.  Please  identify  each  instance  in  which  you  have  testified  orally  or  in  writing 
before  Congress  in  a  governmental  or  non-governmental  capacity  and  specify  the 
date and subject matter of each testimony: Not Applicable. 

18.  Given  the  current  mission,  major  programs,  and  major  operational  objectives 
of  the  department/agency  to  which  you  have  been  nominated,  what  in  your  back-
ground  or  employment  experience  do  you  believe  affirmatively  qualifies  you  for  ap-
pointment to the position for which you have been nominated, and why do you wish 
to serve in that position? 

I  have  been  nominated  to  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Corporation  for  Public 
Broadcasting, a position I believe I am well-suited for. With my history of volunteer 
involvement  with  my  local  public  television  station  (nearly  15  years  as  a  board 
member, including chairman for 2 years) and the industry’s national advocacy board 
(APTS); my career as an educator of children and the parent of four; and my train-
ing  early  in  my  career  as  a  journalist,  I  have  confidence  that  I  am  well-versed  in 
the  issues  facing  the  industry—technologically,  politically,  financially,  and  cul-
turally. 

I  understand  profoundly  the  importance  of  public  broadcasting  and  the  commit-
ment of those involved to provide quality educational, cultural and entertaining pro-
gramming and to fulfill its role in helping shape our democracy. As a board member 
of WEDU in Tampa, Florida and a board member of the Association of Public Tele-
vision  Stations,  I  have  spent  many  hours  advocating  for  the  Federal  funds  to  sus-
tain  public  television.  This  experience  has  helped  me  to  comprehend  and  articulate 
logically  but  also  passionately  just  how  vital  public  broadcasting  is  for  our  country 
and  its  citizens.  Additionally,  during  the  past  decade  and  a  half  I  have  also  under-
gone  a  rigorous  education  in  the  challenges  facing  the  public  broadcasting  industry 
in  the  digital  age,  including  the  multi-million  dollar  capital  campaigns  stations  re-
cently  underwent  to  convert  from  analog  to  digital  broadcasting  and  the  public 
awareness  campaigns  they  are  producing  now  to  inform  the  public  about  the  Feb-
ruary 2009 analog shutoff date. 

As a teacher and mother, I value highly the role public broadcasting plays in edu-
cating our youth; as a former journalist I cherish the notion of bias-free news report-
ing, one not beholden to any interest group or commercial influence. 

For all of these reasons, I wish to serve on the Board of Directors of the Corpora-
tion for Public Broadcasting to help ensure that its mission is secured for the future, 
and that the service it provides to our country continues to strengthen our citizens, 
educationally, culturally and civically. In an era when the CPB continues to be chal-
lenged politically and its existence called into question because of channel prolifera-
tion and new media, I am determined to do my part to help articulate the agency’s 
relevance and necessity in our democracy that so depends upon a well-informed and 
educated citizenry. 

19. What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to ensure that the 
department/agency  has  proper  management  and  accounting  controls,  and  what  ex-
perience do you have in managing a large organization? 

If  confirmed,  I  expect  first  and  foremost  to  be  educated:  I  would  hope  to  learn 
about the intricacies of the CPB, its budget, and how it is structured as an organiza-
tion  to  guarantee  that  it  meets  its  stated  mission;  I  would  expect  to  be  introduced 
to  the  staff  and  learn  about  how  it  works  together  and  with  the  Board  of  Directors 
to fulfill its goals. As an educated board member, I can then fulfill my fiduciary re-
sponsibility  to  the  organization,  to  the  U.S.  Senate,  which  has  oversight  over  the 
agency, and to the American public. Specifically, I will ensure that the Corporation 
has  a  clear  mission  statement  and  business  plan,  that  it  is  properly  staffed  with  a 
reporting  structure  that  can  carry  out  the  plan,  and  that  it  operates  within  the  re-
sources allotted to it by the U.S. Congress. I will review periodic audits of the Cor-
poration to ensure the above. 

I  am  an  experienced  board  member  of  non-profit  organizations  and  institutions, 
having served or currently serving on the boards of an orchestra, a graduate school 
at  a  religious  seminary,  a  synagogue,  a  public  television  station,  a  national  board 
for public television advocacy, and a Jewish federation (communal funding organiza-
tion).  For  each  of  these  positions,  I  have  pored  over  budgets,  audits,  proposals,  fi-
nancial  rescue  plans,  capital  campaign  plans,  and  the  like,  and  I  am  not  afraid  to 
ask  questions  when  the  numbers  don’t  seem  to  add  up,  literally  and  figuratively. 
20.  What  do  you  believe  to  be  the  top  three  challenges  facing  the  department/ 

agency, and why? 

We  live  in  an  age  of  rapidly  advancing  technology;  my  teen-aged  children’s  and 
my  students’  media  savvy  cannot  be  ignored.  The  impact  that  this  younger  genera-

8 

tion already has on traditional forms of broadcasting, where the CPB has its home, 
creates  challenges  for  the  agency  and  for  the  public  television  and  radio  stations  it 
funds.  The  viewing  and  listening  public’s  fascination  with  the  interactive  nature  of 
the internet, the exciting possibilities of open mobile video, the ease and availability 
of  on-demand  viewing  (and  the  ability  to  eliminate  commercial  interruptions—are 
we  losing  that  monopoly?)  all  affect  the  CPB  as  it  seeks  to  make  a  home  in  the 
hearts and minds of younger viewers/listeners. The challenge for the CPB is to rec-
ognize and respond to this, and yet not stray from its core mission of enabling qual-
ity  educational,  cultural  and  entertaining  programming  that  is  available  for  free  to 
American’s citizens. 

Additionally,  some  Americans  and  some  lawmakers  question  the  need  for  public 
support of broadcasting and believe public radio and television stations, if they exist 
at  all,  should  generate  their  own  funding.  These  non-supporters  point  to  channel 
proliferation  and  new  media’s  successful  competition  for  eyeballs  and  eardrums.  To 
me  this  is  a  significant  challenge,  as  the  continual  need  for  the  CPB  to  justify  its 
existence  takes  a  toll  on  the  agency.  Time  spent  by  the  stations  supported  by  the 
CPB to convince Congressional funders of the necessity of those dollars could be bet-
ter spent on addressing the challenges of our digital age. 

Lastly,  next  February,  America  will  land  squarely  in  the  digital  age  when  we 
transition  from  analog  to  digital  transmission  for  television  broadcast.  It  is  esti-
mated that 25 million Americans receive their television over the air; there is some 
concern that not all of these viewers understand the implications of this conversion, 
or what to do. It is also estimated that a significant number of those 25 million are 
supporters  and  viewers  of  public  television.  The  CPB  and  its  stations  must  work 
hard  with  commercial  broadcasters  and  the  Congress  to  ensure  the  success  of  the 
transition  and  ensure  that  the  audience  for  public  television  can  find  its  program-
ming. 

B. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 

1.  Describe  all  financial  arrangements,  deferred  compensation  agreements,  and 
other  continuing  dealings  with  business  associates,  clients,  or  customers.  Please  in-
clude information related to retirement accounts. 

As  a  teacher/administrator,  I  have  a  retirement  account  with  TIAA–CREF,  into 

which my school contributes a percentage of my salary. 

2.  Do  you  have  any  commitments  or  agreements,  formal  or  informal,  to  maintain 
employment, affiliation or practice with any business, association or other organiza-
tion during your appointment? If so, please explain. 

I will continue to work as an administrator (Director of Jewish Studies) and mid-
dle school teacher at the Pinellas County Jewish Day School. The school leadership 
has  agreed  to  grant  me  time  off  to  attend  CPB  board  meetings  and  other  events 
of  the  organization  and/or  industry  that  will  require  my  presence.  If  necessary,  I 
will reduce my classroom assignments to enable this type of travel. 

3.  Indicate  any  investments,  obligations,  liabilities,  or  other  relationships  which 
could  involve  potential  conflicts  of  interest  in  the  position  to  which  you  have  been 
nominated. 

The Office of Government Ethics, in its review, noted that my interests in the fol-
lowing  organizations  are  potential  conflicts  of  interests,  because  they  either  receive 
funding  from  CPB,  are  made  up  of  stations  that  receive  funds  from  CPB,  are  in-
volved  in  the  markets  for  video  programming  content  or  delivery,  or  create  edu-
cational content: AT&T; Comcast Corp.; General Electric Co.; Time Warner; Viacom; 
Yahoo!;  Aeon  Co.  Ltd.;  Mediaset;  Sumitomo  Corporation;  Telecom  Italia;  Cebridge; 
Education  Management  Corporation;  WEDU—Florida  West  Coast  Public 
Boradcasting; and the Association of Public Television Stations. 

4.  Describe  any  business  relationship,  dealing,  or  financial  transaction  which  you 
have  had  during  the  last  10  years,  whether  for  yourself,  on  behalf  of  a  client,  or 
acting  as  an  agent,  that  could  in  any  way  constitute  or  result  in  a  possible  conflict 
of interest in the position to which you have been nominated: Not Applicable. 

5. Describe any activity during the past 10 years in which you have been engaged 
for the purpose of directly or indirectly influencing the passage, defeat, or modifica-
tion of any legislation or affecting the administration and execution of law and pub-
lic policy. 

During the past 10 years, as a citizen of the State of Florida, I have visited mem-
bers  of  the  state’s  delegation  to  the  U.S.  Congress  to  request  adequate  funding  for 
public  television.  I  have  never  received  payment  from  anyone  to  advocate  for  this 
cause. 

6.  Explain  how  you  will  resolve  any  potential  conflict  of  interest,  including  any 

that may be disclosed by your responses to the above items.

It has been pointed out to me during this process by the OGE that certain poten-
tial conflicts exist (see #3 above); with respect to those, pursuant to the CPB’s Con-
flicts  of  Interest  Policy,  I  will  agree  if  confirmed  not  to  participate  in  any  covered 
transaction  between  CPB  and  these  entities.  If  confirmed,  I  will  resign  my  seat  on 
the Board of Directors of the Association of Public Television Stations.

subject of a complaint to any court, administrative agency, professional association, 
disciplinary committee, or other professional group? If so, explain: No. 

2.  Have  you  ever  been  investigated,  arrested,  charged,  or  held  by  any  Federal, 
State,  or  other  law  enforcement  authority  of  any  Federal,  State,  county,  or  munic-
ipal entity, other than for a minor traffic offense? If so, please explain: No. 

3.  Have  you  or  any  business  of  which  you  are  or  were  an  officer  ever  been  in-
volved  as  a  party  in  an  administrative  agency  proceeding  or  civil  litigation?  If  so, 
please explain: No. 

4.  Have  you  ever  been  convicted  (including  pleas  of  guilty  or  nolo  contendere)  of 
any  criminal  violation  other  than  a  minor  traffic  offense?  If  so,  please  explain:  No. 
5.  Have  you  ever  been  accused,  formally  or  informally,  of  sexual  harassment  or

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Ms. Sembler. 
Any questions? Apparently, your record is very clear. 
Ms. SEMBLER. Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Very good. 
May I now recognize Senator Pryor of Arkansas? 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 
Senator MARK PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
And I share the Board’s and the prospective Board members’ con-
cerns about public broadcasting. I think it is a very important part 
of  the  American  fabric,  and  we  need  to  make  sure  that  it  remains 
strong and is doing all the things that it is intended to do. 

So, thank you. 
And I want to also thank Senator Inouye for accommodating my 
father  to  join  us  today  by  teleconference,  and  he  is  in  my  office  in 
Little Rock. So, Dad, glad you could join us today. 

And I don’t have any questions. 
Thank you.

The CHAIRMAN. Senator Pryor or Ambassador Pryor, whatever it 

is, the floor is yours, sir. 

STATEMENT  OF  HON.  DAVID  H.  PRYOR,  RENOMINATED  TO  BE 
A  MEMBER  OF  THE  BOARD  OF  DIRECTORS,  CORPORATION 
FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING 
Senator  DAVID PRYOR.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  you,  and  I  thank 
the distinguished Members of the Committee. And I thank Senator 
Nelson, and I thank Senator Pryor—the other Senator Pryor, or the 
real Senator Pryor, for his nice words. 

And  I  really  do  appreciate,  Mr.  Chairman,  you  and  the  Com-
mittee  and  the  staff  accommodating  my  rather  nutty  and  hectic 
schedule  this  morning,  which  has  sort  of  spun  out  of  control  in  re-
cent days. 

For the last 2 years, it has been my honor and privilege to inter-
act  with  my  esteemed  colleagues  as  a  member  of  the  Corporation 
for  Public  Broadcasting  board.  I  have  had  the  opportunity,  Mr.

Chairman,  to  meet  and  listen  to  many,  many  viewers  and  those 
people  who  run  our  public  television  and  public  radio  stations 
across  America  and  to  learn  how  these  public  television  entities 
and  radio  stations  are  affecting  the  lives  of  each  individual  Amer-
ican. 

I have also continued to keep up my readings, Mr. Chairman, on 
the history and the purpose and the practice and the ultimate mis-
sion of public broadcasting that we should never lose sight of in our 
great and diverse country. What I have seen and heard is most re-
warding,  and  I  believe  it  validates  our  public  investment  in  this 
great enterprise. 

And it is, Mr. Chairman, a great investment. It is a great invest-
ment  in  our  children,  in  our  educational  system,  and  it  is  a  great 
investment in America. 

We are currently celebrating over 40 years of public broadcasting 
in  America.  Every  citizen  of  our  country,  rural  and  urban  alike, 
now  has  access  to  the  many  varied  programs  offered  by  public 
radio  and  television.  With  the  large  television  transition  coming 
next  year,  that  access  is  going  to  be  increasingly  digital  and  will 
span  many  new  and  different  medias—iPods,  phones,  games—and 
it will be accompanied by more outreach work. 

Notwithstanding the many contributions the commercial stations 
and the new cable systems have made, more and more, the average 
citizen  in  America  has  established  a  very  special,  unique  relation-
ship,  even  a  bond,  with  their  favorite  program  brought  to  them  by 
public  broadcast  and  public  radio.  We  have  heard  this  from  so 
many people all over the country through the Corporation for Pub-
lic Broadcasting’s My Source initiative, which asks viewers and lis-
teners  alike  to  tell  local  stations  what  they  like  best  about  their 
services. 

I believe, Mr. Chairman and distinguished Members of the Com-
mittee,  that  the  Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting,  with  its 
unique  partnerships,  member  outlets,  State  governments,  and  pri-
vate donors, has truly developed a real family, and a strong family 
at that, of support for the common belief that the American experi-
ence with each other through this system of public broadcast, tele-
vision  and  radio,  has  met  with  enormous  success.  This  experience 
has  helped  to  bring  us  together  to  define  ourselves  and  to  explore 
in  a  very  transparent  way  our  differences  and  also,  most  impor-
tantly, our common interests. 

‘‘Sesame  Street,’’  Robert  McNeil,  Jim  Lehrer, 

Respectfully,  Mr.  Chairman  and  members  of  the  Committee,  it 
would  be  so  difficult  to  imagine  America  without,  some  40  years 
ago, 
‘‘Antiques 
Roadshow,’’  ‘‘All  Things  Considered,’’  local  and  national  debates, 
‘‘Car  Talk,’’  ‘‘Mr.  Rogers,’’  the  real  and  living  part  of  our  American 
landscape that has spanned these four decades of public broadcast. 
Mr. Chairman, I can attest that I bring no agenda with my nomi-
nation  today.  Although  I  have  very  little  experience  in  the  field  of 
radio  or  television  broadcasting,  I  have  learned  a  great  deal  in  my 
last  22  months,  I  certainly  hope,  both  from  my  wonderful  and  di-
verse  colleagues  on  the  Board—from  the  fine  staff  that  the  Cor-
poration for Public Broadcasting has assembled; from our Chief Ex-
ecutive Officer, Pat Harrison; and from trips and meetings that we 
have attended as a Board.

In  fact,  Mr.  Chairman,  we  had  this  past  summer  a  very,  very 
constructive  meeting  and  a  3-day  session  in  your  state  of  Hawaii, 
which I must say was most enjoyable. 

I  pledge  that  I  do  bring  a  strong  commitment  to  this  system, 
which  is  reinforced  through  my  exposure  to  the  good  work  of  the 
corporation that it has accomplished, and I would like to continue, 
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, to help make a con-
tribution  to  CPB’s  quest  for  excellence.  We  are  certainly  on  our 
way. And because of public radio and public television, I do believe 
that America is a better place. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And once again, thank you for the ac-
commodations  to  allow  me  to  appear  from  Little  Rock,  Arkansas, 
on  this  teleconference.  I  look  forward  to  meeting  our  new  col-
leagues  on  the  board  as  we  go  through  this  coming  year—through 
the coming years ahead. Thank you.

David Pryor follow:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID H. PRYOR, RENOMINATED TO BE A MEMBER 

OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING 

Mr. Chairman and Distinguished Members of the Committee: 
I  am  honored  to  join  you  once  more  as  I  am  re-nominated  to  the  Board  of  the 
Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting.  I  want  to  give  a  special  thanks  to  you,  Chair-
man  Inouye,  and  all  of  the  Commerce  Committee  Staff  for  accommodating  my 
schedule this morning and allowing me to appear before you via teleconference. 

For  going  on  2  years,  I  have  had  the  opportunity  to  interact  with  my  esteemed 
colleagues,  with  public  stations’  staff  and  with  independent  producers,  to  meet  the 
listeners and the viewers, to see how CPB’s educational and investigative program-
ming  truly  affects  the  lives  of  Americans.  I  have  continued  to  keep  up  my  reading 
on the history, purpose, practice, and ultimate mission of public broadcasting in our 
great  and  diverse  country.  What  I  have  seen  and  heard  is  rewarding,  and  I  believe 
validates our public investment in this enterprise. 

America is currently celebrating forty years of public broadcasting in our country. 
Virtually  every  American  citizen,  in  every  rural  and  urban  neighborhood,  now  has 
access to the many varied programs offered by public radio and television. And with 
the  television  transition  next  year,  that  access  will  be  increasingly  digital,  and  will 
span  many  new  and  different  media—iPods,  phones,  games,  and  will  be  accom-
panied by more outreach work. 

Notwithstanding  the  many  contributions  the  commercial  stations  and  new  cable 
systems have made, more and more the average citizen in America has established 
a special relationship, even a bond, with their favorite program brought to them by 
public  broadcast  and  public  radio.  We  have  heard  this  from  so  many  people  over 
the last year through CPB’s My Source initiative, which asks viewers and listeners 
to tell local stations what they like best about their services. 

I truly believe that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, with its unique part-
nerships  with  member  outlets,  state  governments,  and  private  donors,  has  devel-
oped  a  strong  family  of  support  for  the  common  belief  that  sharing  the  American 
experience  with  each  other  through  public  broadcast  television  and  radio  has  met 
enormous success. This experience has helped bring us together, to define ourselves, 
to explore in a very transparent way our differences and common interests. 

Respectfully,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  it  would  be  difficult 
to  imagine  what  America  might  have  missed  had  we  failed  some  forty  years  ago  to 
authorize  and  commit  to  a  system  of  public  broadcasting—Sesame  Street.  Robert 
McNeil  and  Jim  Lehrer.  Antiques  Roadshow.  All  Things  Considered.  Local  and  na-
tional  debates.  Car  Talk.  Mr.  Rogers—a  real  and  living  part  of  our  American  land-
scape. 

Mr. Chairman—I can attest that I bring no agenda with my nomination. Although 
I  have  very  little  experience  in  the  field  of  radio  or  television  broadcasting,  I  have 
learned  a  great  deal  in  my  last  22  months—both  from  my  diverse  colleagues  and 
from the trips and meetings that we have attended as a Board. 

I  pledge  that  I  do  bring  a  strong  commitment—which  is  reinforced  through  my 
exposure to the good work that the Corporation has accomplished—and I would like

to continue, to help contribute to CPB’s quest for excellence. Because of public radio 
and television, I believe that America is a better place.

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Senator Pryor. You have 

come through loud and clear. 

Senator DAVID PRYOR. Thank you, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. And I commend you for your continuation of pub-
lic  service.  I  knew  you  had  it  in  you.  But  if  you  don’t  mind,  I  will 
call upon your son to question you. A son should not—— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator MARK PRYOR. Mr. Chairman, thank you. 
I really don’t have any questions for the panel. But again, thank 
you  all  for  your  interest  in  serving  public  broadcasting.  I  think  it 
is a very important part of the American fabric, as I said a few mo-
ments ago. 

And  I  know  how  much  my  father  treasures  the  opportunity  to 
serve in that way because he has that strong conviction of how im-
portant it is. So I am glad to see the rest of you all doing the same 
thing. 

Mr. Chairman, thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. You don’t wish to question your father? 
Senator  MARK PRYOR.  Well,  is  he  under  oath?  That  is  what  I 

want to know. No, we will leave that for later, but thank you. 

The CHAIRMAN. Senator Stevens? 

STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Senator  STEVENS.  I  don’t  know  what  we  can  do  with  two  Pryors 

at the same time on this Committee. That is the problem. 

I,  too,  congratulate  you  for  being  willing  to  continue  to  serve, 

Senator, and am happy to see you here today. 

Senator DAVID PRYOR. Thank you, sir. 
Senator  STEVENS.  Would  you  put  my  statement  in  the  record 

someplace, Mr. Chairman? I am sorry to be late. 
The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, so ordered. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Stevens follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this morning’s hearing. I am pleased to see 

all the nominees here today. 

In  an  age  when  talk  shows  and  soap  operas  rule  daytime  television  and  reality 
shows  are  rampant  in  primetime,  it  is  important  that  viewers,  especially  children, 
have  access  to  the  educational  and  diverse  programming  provided  by  public  broad-
casting. 

These programs are available through both TV and radio, and most, if not every-
one  in  this  room,  has  likely  watched  or  listened  to  a  program  produced  by  a  public 
broadcasting  station  like  PBS  or  NPR.  The  Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting  is 
responsible  for  supporting  these  stations  and  ensuring  that  the  programming  is 
available to the general public. 

The nominees today have been selected to perform a vital role as members of the 
Board  of  Directors  of  CPB.  I  know  a  few  of  them  already  have  experience  on  this 
board, and I thank them for their continued willingness to serve. To the rest, I also 
thank them and I look forward to hearing from them.

Senator STEVENS. Thank you. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Senator  Hutchison?  Senator  Hutchison,  do  you 

want to question Senator Pryor? 

STATEMENT OF HON. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS 

Senator HUTCHISON. I was just trying to find out exactly what— 
where  you  were  because  I  was  late.  Has  everyone  made  opening 
statements or not made opening statements? 

The CHAIRMAN. You may make your opening statement. 
Senator  HUTCHISON.  Just  wanting  to  know  what  your  format  is. 

Have they made opening statements yet? 

The CHAIRMAN. Yes. 
Senator  HUTCHISON.  OK.  Well,  let  me  just  say—and  David,  it  is 
great  to  see  you  again,  and  all  of  you  here  who  are  nominated  for 
the  Board—it  is  such  an  important  Board  for  our  country.  And 
while  many  people,  we  have  so  many  choices  on  channels  now, 
there is no channel that gives programming for young children like 
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 

It  is  the  one  that  you  can  rely  on  that  will  be  educational  and 
appropriate, and I am not going to ever have to worry about hear-
ing  words  that  I  won’t  let  my  children  use.  I  don’t  ever  have  to 
worry about violence or people not treating each other with respect, 
which you do find on other ‘‘cartoon channels.’’ 

So  I  appreciate  that,  and  when  we  are  into  the  question  period, 
I  just  will  ask  if  everyone  is  committed  to  continuing  wholesome, 
educational  programming  for  children  because  there  is  no  alter-
native out there for that. 

And  then  second,  I  think  the  outreach  that  the  CPB  does  in  our 
communities  in  the  Ready  To  Learn  program  for  literacy  for  ages 
2  through  8,  which  has  even  won  an  award  from  the  Department 
of Education, is also another major achievement. 

And  the  news,  Jim  Lehrer  is  still  just  the  greatest  at  providing 
in-depth  news  analysis  and  coverage  and  interviews.  He  does  a 
super  job.  McNeil/Lehrer  was  one  of  my  favorites  for  years,  and 
now Jim Lehrer has just continued to provide that kind of in-depth 
backup news that we wouldn’t get other places. 

So  I  thank  you  all  for  being  willing  to  serve,  every  one  of  you. 
I  have  read  your  qualifications,  and  I  think  you  are  an  excellent 
mix of our great Nation. And so, I applaud it. 

And Mr. Chairman, thank you for—I think you have already said 
that  we  are  going  to  have  a  markup  off  the  floor  to  allow  these 
nominees to go forward. Is that correct? 

The CHAIRMAN. We will do our best. 
Senator  HUTCHISON.  Oh,  OK.  Well,  I  hope  we  will  because  if  we 
can  have  the  confirmation  off  the  floor  so  that  they  can  move  for-
ward, I think it would be a great asset for our country. 

So thank you very much. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Senator Thune?

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA 

Senator  THUNE.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  don’t  have  any  questions  for 
our  nominees,  but  I  do  want  to  thank  them  for  their  willingness 
to serve and, in some cases, to re-up and do another term. We have 
got  some  wonderful  people  with  some  great  resumes  and  a  wealth 
of experience and knowledge that they can bring to these positions. 
And  so,  I  know  that  public  service  is  a  calling,  and  I  appreciate 
anybody  who  is  willing  to  do  it  when  there  are  lots  of  other  de-
mands  on  their  time.  And  so,  I  appreciate  very  much  the  service

STATEMENT OF HON. CHERYL FELDMAN HALPERN, 

MEMBER, BOARD OF DIRECTORS, 

CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING 

Ms. HALPERN. Thank you. 
Chairman  Inouye,  Senator  Hutchison,  and  distinguished  Mem-
bers of this Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to address the 
Committee and for your consideration of my nomination to serve a 
second term on the Board of the CPB. 

My  time  at  the  CPB  has  been  among  the  most  fulfilling  of  my 
years  of  involvement  in  public  service.  A  commitment  that  has  in-
cluded service on the Boards for International Broadcasting, Broad-
casting  Board  of  Governors,  the  Foundation  for  the  Defense  of  De-
mocracies,  the  President’s  Advisory  Council  of  Barnard  College, 
and the Women’s Democracy Network. 

Since  2002,  I  have  served  on  the  Board  of  CPB,  and  I  was  also 
privileged to be elected by my Board colleagues to serve two terms 
as  Chair.  I  wanted  to  take  this  opportunity  to  talk  about  my  work 
on the CPB Board in particular. As you know, the board is charged 
with  overseeing  compliance  with  the  laws  and  regulations  gov-
erning the corporation and the use of public broadcasting funds. 

CPB’s  Board  has  extensive  oversight  over  matters  related  to 
budgetary  controls  and  governance.  We  give  the  CPB  staff  broad 
policy  guidance,  consistent  with  the  directives  of  the  law,  but  the 
Board has no role in individual program decisions. 

Shortly  after  my  becoming  Chairman,  the  Board  received  the 
findings  and  recommendations  of  the  CPB’s  Office  of  the  Inspector 
General,  published  in  November  2005.  As  soon  as  we  received  the 
OIG’s  recommendations,  we  moved  to  act  deliberately  and  effec-
tively.  A  comprehensive  review  of  the  governance  and  internal  op-
erations  of  the  corporation  followed,  and  we  call  this  review 
‘‘Project Champion.’’ 

For  the  first  time  in  CPB’s  40-year  history,  we  initiated  a  top- 
to-bottom review of its operations and procedures. Never before had 
our organization undertaken a major examination of every task, op-
eration, and practice to ensure that CPB is following best practices 
and promoting accountability.

We  needed  to  establish  a  tone  from  the  top  based  on  integrity, 
ethical  values,  and  clear  assignments  of  authority  and  responsi-
bility,  which  are  critical  to  the  success  of  any  organization.  Thus, 
the  Board  established  a  Corporate  Governance  Committee  cur-
rently chaired by one of our Board members and one of your former 
colleagues, Senator David Pryor, and as well as an Executive Com-
pensation Committee. 

As part of Project Champion, the Board also implemented a new 
code of ethics and a conflict of interest policy for directors, clarified 
board  and  CEO  roles  and  responsibilities,  committed  to  trans-
parent actions during board meetings, prevented the use of political 
tests  and  employment  decisions,  adopted  a  whistleblower  policy, 
adopted new expense guidelines, and committed to a revision of its 
role in CPB contracting. 

I  am  proud  that  in  my  time  as  chair  we  made  these  significant 
revisions  to  our  governance  procedures,  established  more  clearly 
defined  roles  and  responsibilities  for  the  Board  Chair  and  for  the 
CPB  President  and  CEO.  In  addition,  the  Board,  under  my  tenure 
as  Chair  and  since,  has  committed  to  holding  more  meetings  out-
side  of  Washington,  D.C.  This  allows  us  to  see  for  ourselves  how 
America’s  public  television  and  radio  stations  are,  in  fact,  serving 
these local public audiences. 

There is an old public broadcasting saying. ‘‘When you have seen 
one  public  broadcasting  station,  you  have  seen  one  public  broad-
casting  station.’’  My  fellow  Board  members’  and  my  experiences 
certainly reflect that sentiment. In the past few years, we have in-
dividually and as a Board visited stations across the country. Every 
station  we  have  visited  is  unique,  with  its  own  history,  its  own 
challenges,  and  its  own  understanding  of  its  place  in  the  commu-
nity. 

These visits offer us valuable opportunities to connect with public 
broadcasting  where  it  happens  and  to  learn  from  the  men  and 
women who work every day to bring their communities not only the 
programming,  but  also  the  outreach,  the  online  services,  and  the 
opportunity  for  community  engagement  that  set  public  broad-
casting apart. 

To give just one example, on our trip to Hawaii, where we visited 
with you, Mr. Chairman, we learned how the islands that make up 
the  state  use  public  broadcasting  for  emergency  preparedness,  for 
promoting  literacy,  and  for  celebrating  the  state’s  diverse  and  spe-
cial culture. 

We  are  also  working  to  raise  public  awareness  of  the  excellence 
in  our  programming.  I  am  proud  to  currently  serve  the  Board  as 
its  Chairman  of  the  Public  Awareness  Committee,  which  carries 
forward this work on an ongoing basis. 

By reaching out to local station boards, conducting station visits, 
working  to  educate  opinion  leaders  and  elected  representatives, 
and  doing  regular  outreach,  we  are  making  ourselves  effective 
goodwill  Ambassadors  on  behalf  of  all  public  broadcasters.  We 
strive to give voice to a simple message. Public broadcasting is our 
source for quality programming across the entire spectrum of possi-
bility. 

All of these efforts bear the imprint and reflect the hard work of 
a dedicated staff and board. My goal as a member of the Board has

22 

been, and I hope will continue to be, to responsibly serve as a fidu-
ciary for public broadcasting as mandated by Congress. 

Thank  you  again,  Mr.  Chairman  and  distinguished  Members  of 
the  Committee,  for  inviting  me  to  testify  today.  And  I  would  be 
happy to answer any questions you might have. 

[The  prepared  statement  and  biographical  information  of  Ms. 

Halpern follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. CHERYL FELDMAN HALPERN, MEMBER, BOARD OF 

DIRECTORS, CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING 

Chairman Inouye, Senator Hutchison, and Members of this Committee, thank you 
for  this  opportunity  to  address  the  Committee  and  for  your  consideration  of  my 
nomination to serve a second term on the Board of the CPB. 

My  time  at  CPB  has  been  among  the  most  fulfilling  during  the  years  of  my  in-
volvement in public service—a commitment that has included service on the Boards 
for  International  Broadcasting,  the  Broadcasting  Board  of  Governors,  the  Founda-
tion  for  the  Defense  of  Democracies,  the  President’s  Advisory  Council  of  Barnard 
College,  and  the  Women’s  Democracy  Network.  Since  2002,  I  have  served  on  the 
Board  of  CPB,  and  I  was  also  privileged  to  be  elected  by  my  board  colleagues  to 
serve two terms as Chair. 

I  wanted  to  take  this  opportunity  to  talk  about  my  work  on  the  CPB  Board  in 
particular. As you know, the Board is charged with overseeing compliance with the 
laws  and  regulations  governing  the  Corporation  and  the  use  of  public  broadcasting 
funds.  CPB’s  Board  has  extensive  oversight  over  matters  related  to  budgetary  con-
trols  and  governance.  We  give  the  CPB  staff  broad  policy  guidance,  consistent  with 
the directives of the law, but the Board has no role in individual program decisions. 
Shortly  after  my  becoming  Chairman,  the  Board  received  the  findings  and  rec-
ommendations of CPB’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG), published in Novem-
ber 2005. 

As soon as we received the OIG’s recommendations, we moved to act deliberately 
and  effectively.  A  comprehensive  review  of  the  governance  and  internal  operations 
of the Corporation followed; we call this review Project Champion. 

For  the  first  time  in  CPB’s  40-year  history,  we  initiated  a  top-to-bottom  review 
of  its  operations  and  procedures.  Never  before  had  our  organization  undertaken  a 
major  examination  of  every  task,  operation  and  practice  to  ensure  that  CPB  is  fol-
lowing best practices and promoting accountability. 

We  needed  to  establish  a  ‘‘tone  from  the  top’’  based  on  integrity,  ethical  values, 
and clear assignments of authority and responsibility, which are critical to the suc-
cess of any organization. Thus the Board established a Corporate Governance Com-
mittee,  currently  chaired  by  one  of  our  Board  members  and  one  of  your  former  col-
leagues, Senator David Pryor, and an Executive Compensation Committee. 

As  part  of  Project  Champion,  the  Board  also  implemented  a  new  code  of  ethics 
and  a  conflict  of  interest  policy  for  directors;  clarified  board  and  CEO  roles  and  re-
sponsibilities;  committed  to  transparent  actions  during  board  meetings;  prevented 
the  use  of  political  tests  in  employment  decisions;  adopted  a  whistleblower  policy; 
adopted new expense guidelines; and committing to a revision of its role in CPB con-
tracting. 

I  am  proud  that  in  my  time  as  Chair,  we  made  these  significant  revisions  to  our 
governance  procedures,  established  more  clearly  defined  roles  and  responsibilities 
for  the  Board  Chair  and  for  the  CPB  President  and  CEO,  and  improved  account-
ability and transparency in the operations of our organization. 

In  addition,  the  Board,  under  my  tenure  as  Chair  and  since,  has  committed  to 
holding  more  meetings  outside  of  Washington,  D.C.  This  allows  us  to  see  for  our-
selves  how  America’s  public  television  and  radio  stations  are  in  fact  serving  these 
local  public  audiences.  There’s  an  old  public  broadcasting  saying  that  ‘‘when  you’ve 
seen  one  public  broadcasting  station,  you’ve  seen  one  public  broadcasting  station.’’ 
My  fellow  Board  members’  and  my  experiences  certainly  reflect  that  sentiment.  In 
the past few years we have, individually and as a Board, visited stations in Alaska, 
Arkansas,  Arizona,  California,  Florida,  Hawaii,  Louisiana,  Mississippi,  Montana, 
New  Jersey,  New  York,  North  Dakota,  Pennsylvania,  Puerto  Rico  and  West  Vir-
ginia.  Every  station  we  have  visited  is  unique,  with  its  own  history,  its  own  chal-
lenges, and its own understanding of its place in its community. 

We have taken every opportunity to meet with station managers, staff and mem-
bers  of  station  boards  of  directors.  Through  these  visits  we  have  been  able  to  see 
firsthand the role that public broadcasting plays in linking people and their commu-

nities with ideas, information and the resources they need in order to address com-
munal concerns and create positive change. 

These  visits  offer  us  valuable  opportunities  to  connect  with  public  broadcasting 
where  it  happens,  and  to  learn  from  the  men  and  women  who  work  every  day  to 
bring to their communities not only the programming, but also the outreach, the on-
line  services,  and  the  opportunities  for  community  engagement  that  set  public 
broadcasting apart. 

To  give  just  one  example,  on  our  trip  to  Hawaii,  where  we  visited  with  you,  Mr. 
Chairman,  we  learned  how  the  islands  that  make  up  the  state  use  public  broad-
casting  for  emergency  preparedness,  for  promoting  literacy,  and  for  celebrating  the 
state’s diverse and special culture. 

We  are  also  working  to  raise  public  awareness  of  the  excellence  in  our  program-
ming. I am proud to serve the Board currently as its Chairman of the Public Aware-
ness  Committee,  which  carries  forward  this  work  on  an  ongoing  basis.  By  reaching 
out  to  local  station  boards,  conducting  station  visits,  working  to  educate  opinion 
leaders and elected representatives, and doing regular outreach, we are making our-
selves effective good will Ambassadors on behalf of all public broadcasters. We need 
to  continue  to  engage  the  larger  public  audience—not  just  PBS  viewers  and  NPR 
listeners—but those who simply do not know about the excellence that exists every 
day  on  America’s  public  broadcasting  stations.  We  strive  to  give  voice  to  a  simple 
message: public broadcasting is ‘‘My Source’’ for quality programming across the en-
tire spectrum of possibility. As I have often said, we need to share our pride in pub-
lic broadcasting. 

All of these efforts bear the imprint and reflect the hard work of a dedicated staff 
and  board.  I  can  say  that  I  have  learned  much  during  the  course  of  my  service  on 
the  CPB  Board;  whether  it  was  in  the  preparation  of  the  Board’s  response  to  the 
OIG’s  review,  the  creation  of  Project  Champion,  the  positive  interaction  resulting 
from  bringing  our  meetings  to  the  communities  across  America  or  the  enthusiasm 
for  the  Public  Awareness  Initiative.  My  goal  as  a  member  of  the  Board  has  been, 
and I hope, will continue to be, to responsibly serve as a fiduciary for public broad-
casting  as  mandated  by  Congress.  Thank  you  again,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members 
of  the  Committee,  for  inviting  me  to  testify  today.  I  would  be  happy  to  answer  any 
questions you might have.

18.  Given  the  current  mission,  major  programs,  and  major  operational  objectives 
of  the  department/agency  to  which  you  have  been  nominated,  what  in  your  back-
ground  or  employment  experience  do  you  believe  affirmatively  qualifies  you  for  ap-
pointment to the position for which you have been nominated, and why do you wish 
to serve in that position? 

I  have  served  on  the  boards  of  the  Board  of  International  Broadcasting,  the 
Broadcasting  Board  of  Governors,  and  the  Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting 
(CPB).  I  was  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  the  CPB  for  two  terms  of  office.  Therefore, 
I  have  experience  in  U.S.  Government  funded  broadcasting.  More  specifically,  in 
1990, I was nominated by President Bush and confirmed by the Senate to serve on 
the Board for International Broadcasting (the ‘‘BIB’’). In 1995, when the BIB ceased 
to exist due to congressional legislation, I was the only carryforward to serve n the 
Broadcasting  Board  of  Governors.  I  was  subsequently  re-nominated  by  President 
Clinton  and  confirmed  by  the  Senate.  In  2002,  I  be  an  my  service  on  the  Board  of 
the  CPB.  I  have  served  on  the  CPB  Board  of  Directors  for  the  past  6  years,  and 
as Chairman of the Board for the last 2 years (October 2005–October 2007). During

my  tenure  as  Chairman,  we  initiated  a  complete  overall  and  reform  of  CPB’s  gov-
ernance  and  internal  control  procedures,  we  began  an  initiative  to  increase  aware-
ness  of  the  value  and  service  that  public  broadcasting  offers  Americans  across  our 
country, and I personally made sure that our board traveled round America to view 
public broadcasting, not in the reports and ane dotes received in Washington, D.C., 
but beyond the beltway in stat s like Alaska, Mississippi, Hawaii, North Dakota and 
Arizona. 

19. What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to ensure that the 
department/agency  has  proper  management  and  accounting  controls,  and  what  ex-
perience do you have in managing large organization? 

Members  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  both  individually  and  collectively  as  a  gov-
erning body, are responsible for ensuring that the Corporation’s officers observe pru-
dent  management  and  accounting  practices.  This  is  achieved  through  an  effective 
system of internal controls, approved by the Board, which include systematic report-
ing  requirements.  As  Chair  of  the  CPB  Board,  I  initiated  and  oversaw  ‘‘Project 
Champion,’’  a  comprehensive  reform  of  CPB’s  governance  and  internal  controls  fol-
lowing the Inspector General’s November 2005 investigative report. That multi-year 
effort  led  to  the  adoption  of  a  broad  range  of  ‘‘best  practices″,  patterned  on  Sar-
banes-Oxley  and  other  safeguards,  which  have  made  the  work  of  CPB  more  trans-
parent and effective. 

20.  What  do  you  believe  to  be  the  top  three  challenges  facing  the  department/ 

agency, and why? 

A  major  challenge  facing  the  public  broadcasting  industry  and,  by  extension,  the 
CPB,  is  maintaining  and  expanding  its  service  to  the  American  people  during  the 
transition  from  analog  to  digital  broadcasting.  With  respect  to  television,  CPB’s 
most immediate task is to ensure hat the public television audience continues to be 
served by their stations after the February 17, 2009 deadline for analog shutoff. As 
such,  in  allocating  its  special  digital  appropriation  provided  by  Congress,  CPB  has 
made  its  highest  priority  investment  in  the  transmission  and  related  equipment 
needed to help stations meet the transition. While not facing a date-certain shutoff, 
public  radio  stations  are  leading  the  way  in  adopting  this  new  digital  technology. 
This  will  allow  them  to  enhance  the  quality  and  scope  of  services  they  provide  to 
their  communities,  as  well  as  to  provide  their  listeners  with  richer  quality  sound 
than is currently available. 

Another challenge I would point to is that of ensuring public broadcasting’s lead-
ership  in  children’s  and  educational  programming  in  a  fast-changing  media  land-
scape.  Education  is  a  core  value  of  the  public  broadcasting  community,  as  it  has 
been  since  its  inception.  This  fact  is  underscored  by  the  results  of  a  comprehensive 
CPB-commissioned  survey  of  public  television  stations,  which  documents  the  edu-
cational  services  stations  are  providing  directly  to  their  communities.  These  serv-
ices,  which  extend  beyond  the  broadcast,  range  from  helping  to  ensure  that  low-in-
come  children  arrive  at  school  ‘‘ready  to  learn’’;  special  in-person  reading  programs 
for parents and childcare providers; to professional development resources for teach-
ers;  to  online  activities  designed  to  spark  student  learning  in  subjects  such  as 
science and math. As a current CPB Board member, and a nominee to continue my 
service  on  this  Board,  I  am  committed  to  doing  all  I  can  to  sustain  the  robust  and 
vital contribution public broadcasting stations make when it comes to education and 
an informed and strengthened civil society. 

A third challenge which we have begun to address is that of increasing the Amer-
ican  people’s  awareness  of  the  breadth  and  depth  of  the  services  that  public  broad-
casting has to offer and the value that public broadcasting brings to American soci-
ety  and  local  communities.  From  the  bricks  and  mortar  of  station  facilities  in  hun-
dreds of communities across the country to thousands of hours of community service 
programming,  including  millions  of  dollars  of  investment  in  education  and  beyond- 
the-broadcast  community  engagement  activities,  the  public  media  enterprise  con-
nects citizens to their local communities and is, simply put, a national treasure. As 
Chair  of  the  CPB  Board’s  Public  Awareness  Committee,  I  believe  that  to  preserve 
that  treasure,  it  is  essential  that  the  American  public,  who  have  supported  public 
broadcasting  with  their  tax  dollars,  be  made  aware  to  the  full  extent  of  how  public 
media enhances lives and enriches communities.

Cheryl  Halpern  has  a  long  record  of  public  service  in  broadcasting,  women’s 

issues, education, and international affairs. 

Mrs. Halpern has been nominated to the boards of both national and international 
public broadcasting organizations by Presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and 
George W. Bush. 

In 1990, Mrs. Halpern was confirmed as a member of the Board for International 
Broadcasting and as a Director of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). From 
1995 through 2002, she served on the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) over-
seeing  Voice  of  America,  Radio  and  TV  Marti,  RFE/RL,  Worldnet,  Radio  Free  Asia

STATEMENT OF BRUCE M. RAMER, 

MEMBER-DESIGNATE, BOARD OF DIRECTORS, 
CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING 

Mr. RAMER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Chairman  Inouye,  Ranking  Member  Hutchison,  and  distin-
guished  Members  of  the  Committee,  first  let  me  express  my  grati-
tude for your holding this hearing, especially at this time when the 
Committee’s schedule is so full with so many pressing issues. 

And  of  course,  I  do  want  to  thank  the  President  for  nominating 
me  to  serve  on  the  Board  of  the  Corporation  for  Public  Broad-
casting.

I  am  very  excited  at  the  prospect  of  having  the  opportunity  of 
serving  CPB  and  of  having  the  opportunity  to  help  advance  the 
cause  of  public  broadcasting  in  the  public  interest—a  cause  with 
which  I  have  been  deeply  involved  and  committed  for  some  25 
years—and to do everything I possibly can to strengthen it. 

I  have  long  understood  that  public  broadcasting  is  one  of  our 
country’s  most  important  community  assets.  I  would  say  it  was  a 
jewel  in  the  crown  of  our  community  assets.  And  as  an  American, 
I  am  very  proud  of  what  public  broadcasting  accomplishes  across 
our Nation. 

My  involvement  with  public  broadcasting  began  in  1992,  when  I 
joined  the  Board  of  Directors  of  KCET,  the  PBS  affiliate  covering 
Southern California. I served as Chairman of that Board from 2001 
to  2003,  and  other  than  a  brief  mandatory  hiatus,  I  have  been  on 
the  Board  ever  since.  At  this  time,  I  serve  on  the  Executive  Com-
mittee,  I  chair  the  Programming  Committee,  and  I  am  a  member 
of the Audit Committee. 

And  I  have  come—during  this  time,  I  have  come  to  understand 
better the relationship between CPB and PBS and something of the 
nuances of that relationship. I should note that, if confirmed, I will, 
of  course,  recuse  myself  if  any  conflict  should  arise  between  CPB 
and KCET or in connection with any other entity with which I may 
be involved either as an attorney or otherwise. 

Public  broadcasting  fills  a  crucial  need  in  our  country  by  pro-
viding programming which might not otherwise see the light of day 
on  commercial  or  pay  television,  programming  such  as  that  de-
signed for our children, for caregivers, for preschoolers, and of spe-
cial  note,  for  all  the  elements  of  our  increasingly  diverse  popu-
lation. Programming which can be received by the 15 percent or so 
of our population which relies on free over-the-air broadcasting. 

At  KCET,  I  saw  how  public  television  comes  to  grips  with  many 
of  these  issues,  how  local  as  well  as  national  interests  are  served. 
In  my  written  testimony  submitted  to  the  Committee,  there  are 
some examples of this. But I will omit them now in the interest of 
brevity. 

I  do  want  to  add,  however,  that  my  belief  in  the  power  and  ac-
complishments of public radio is equally strong, and I look forward 
to expanding my knowledge of the shape of this medium today and 
its opportunity to grow in the future. 

But  please  let  me  comment  briefly  on  the  importance  of  CPB’s 
community  service  grants.  CSGs,  as  you  know,  are  unrestricted 
grants to stations. They permit stations to turn on the lights. They 
permit stations to operate. They permit stations to pay salaries and 
for  public  television  stations  to  help  pay  PBS  dues  and  to  acquire 
programming. They are crucial. They are indispensable. 

My  day  job  as  an  entertainment  lawyer  for  most  of  my  career 
also  deals  with  communication  and  the  media.  This  gives  me  an 
additional  perspective  and  insights,  which  can  be  helpful  if  I  am 
permitted to serve CPB. 

My interest in communications goes back to my college days and 
now  includes  service  on  the  Board  of  Counselors  and  as  Co-Execu-
tive  Chair  of  the  Executive  Committee  of  the  USC  Annenberg 
School  for  Communications.  This  Board  further  exposes  me  to  the

32 

current  and  future  needs  and  requirements  of  broadcasting,  jour-
nalism, and the media. 

My  law  practice  and  my  involvement  with  both  the  Annenberg 
School and KCET have helped to educate me about new and evolv-
ing  media  and  the  changing  media  landscape.  There  may  be  an 
even  greater  future  for  public  broadcasting  if  it  can  seize  the  ad-
vantages of these new technologies. 

Other  community  involvements  of  mine,  which  range  from  hav-
ing  served  as  National  President  of  the  American  Jewish  Com-
mittee  to  membership  on  the  Board  of  Trustees  of  the  University 
of  Southern  California,  Pacific  Council  for  International  Affairs, 
and  the  Herrhausen  Institute  for  International  Dialogue  of  the 
Deutsche  Bank,  will  also  help  me  to  contribute  more  meaningfully 
to CPB if I am confirmed. 

And  if  I  am  confirmed,  it  is  my  hope  to  be  part  of  a  team 
strengthening an evolving public broadcasting system and its work 
in  the  communities  across  our  country.  I  am  committed  to  do  all 
that  I  can  to  enhance  the  already  high  quality  of  public  broad-
casting for our citizens and to work toward even wider diversity of 
programming, be it news, education, information, or entertainment, 
always  with  the  singular  purpose  of  serving  the  interests  of  the 
American public. 

My  commitment  is  passionate  and  deep.  I  hope  to  have  the  op-
portunity  to  serve  my  country  and  public  broadcasting  by  being 
confirmed  as  a  member  of  the  Board  of  the  Corporation  for  Public 
Broadcasting. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of this 
Committee,  for  the  opportunity  for  making  this  presentation  and 
look forward to answering any questions you may have. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF BRUCE M. RAMER, MEMBER-DESIGNATE, 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS, CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING 

Chairman  Inouye,  Ranking  Member  Hutchison  and  Members  of  the  Committee, 
let  me  express  my  gratitude  for  your  holding  this  hearing,  especially  at  this  time 
when the Committee’s schedule is so full with many pressing issues. And, naturally, 
my thanks to the President for nominating me to serve on the Board of the Corpora-
tion for Public Broadcasting. 

I  am  excited  at  the  prospect  of  having  the  opportunity  of  serving  CPB,  of  having 
the  opportunity  to  help  to  advance  the  cause  of  public  broadcasting  in  the  public 
interest—a  cause  with  which  I  have  been  deeply  involved  and  committed  for  some 
25 years—and to do everything I possibly can to strengthen it. 

I  have  long  understood  that  public  broadcasting  is  one  of  our  country’s  most  im-
portant  community  assets.  As  an  American,  I  am  very  proud  of  what  public  broad-
casting accomplishes across our nation. 

My  involvement  with  public  broadcasting  began  in  1992  when  I  joined  the  Board 
of Directors of KCET, the PBS affiliate in Los Angeles covering Southern California. 
I served as Chairman of that Board between 2001 and 2003, and other than a one- 
year mandatory hiatus, I have been on the Board continuously. At this time, I serve 
on its Executive Committee, as Chair of its Programming Committee and as a mem-
ber of the Audit Committee. In this time, I have come to understand better the rela-
tionship between PBS and CPB, and something of the nuances of that relationship. 
(I  should  note  that  I  will,  of  course,  recuse  myself  if  any  conflict  should  arise  be-
tween  CPB  and  KCET  or  in  connection  with  any  other  entity  with  which  I  may  be 
involved as an attorney or otherwise.) 

Public  broadcasting  fills  a  crucial  need  in  our  country  by  providing  programming 
which might otherwise not see the light of day on commercial or pay television. Pro-
gramming  such  as  that  which  is  designed  for  children,  for  caregivers,  for  pre-

schoolers and, of special note, for all the elements of our increasingly diverse popu-
lation. 

At KCET, I saw how public television comes to grips with these issues, how local, 
as  well  as  national,  interests  are  served.  For  example,  in  our  state  a  third  of  the 
children  entering  Kindergarten  are  unprepared.  With  so  many  single-parent  and 
two-working-parent  families,  children  in  the  0–5  age  group,  during  the  period  of 
their greatest brain development, are often being raised by untrained caregivers. We 
were  able  to  use  television  to  provide  these  caregivers  with  tools  to  improve  the 
readiness  of  the  children  in  their  care  for  Kindergarten.  Our  success  in  the  first  2 
years  of  production,  when  the  show  was  aired  only  on  public  television  stations  in 
California,  motivated  CPB  to  award  a  grant  to  KCET  that  allowed  the  program  to 
go national in its third season. The programs, ‘‘A Place of Our Own’’ in English and 
‘‘Los  Nin˜ os  en  Su  Casa’’  in  Spanish,  are  now  seen  on  public  television  stations 
reaching over 74 percent of the U.S. Television Households. The programs have won 
numerous  awards,  including  the  George  Foster  Peabody  Award,  and  the  websites 
won  the  international  competition  for  The  Japan  Prize,  awarded  to  one  website  in 
the  world  by  NHK.  This  is  a  good  example  of  the  synergy  between  CPB  and  PBS. 
KCET  also  just  premiered  its  newest  production  on  PBS,  an  animated  pre-school 
science  program,  ‘‘Sid  the  Science  Kid,’’  which  uses  the  latest  motion  capture  tech-
nology  to  teach  children  the  wonders  of  science.  The  companion  website  is  geared 
to help parents capture the natural curiosity of their children to facilitate scientific 
inquiry in the earliest years. 

As  Chair  of  KCET’s  Programming  Committee,  I  have  worked  to  support  efforts 
to  mount  European  co-production,  which  has  led  to  a  meaningful  relationship  with 
BBC  on  historical  documentary,  drama,  and  arts  programming,  including:  ‘‘Copen-
hagen,’’ ‘‘How Art Made the World,’’ ‘‘Auschwitz and the Making of the Nazi State,’’ 
and  ‘‘Stalin,  Churchill  and  Roosevelt,’’  which  will  air  in  2009.  This  relationship  is 
deepening,  as  KCET  has  been  given  the  assignment  to  be  the  exclusive  marketing 
and distribution agent for BBC World News for U.S. public television. 

I  must  add  that  my  belief  in  the  power  and  accomplishments  of  public  radio  is 
equally  strong  and  I  look  forward  to  expanding  my  knowledge  of  the  shape  of  this 
medium today and its opportunity to grow in the future. 

Please  let  me  comment  briefly  on  the  importance  of  CPB’s  Community  Service 
Grants.  CSGs,  as  you  know,  are  unrestricted  grants  to  stations.  They  permit  sta-
tions to operate—to pay salaries, to turn on the lights and, for public television sta-
tions, to help pay PBS dues. And to acquire programming. They are crucial. 

My  ‘‘day  job’’,  as  an  entertainment  lawyer  for  most  of  my  career,  also  deals  with 
communication and the media. This gives me an additional perspective and insights 
which can be helpful in serving CPB. 

My  interest  in  communications  goes  back  to  my  college  days  and  now  includes 
service on the Board of Councilors, and Co-Chair of the Executive Committee, of the 
USC  Annenberg  School  for  Communications.  This  Board  exposes  me  further  to  the 
current  and  future  needs  and  requirements  of  broadcasting,  journalism  and  the 
media. 

My law practice and my involvement with both the Annenberg School and KCET 
have  helped  to  educate  me  about  new  and  evolving  media  and  the  changing  media 
landscape.  There  may  be  an  even  greater  future  for  public  broadcasting  if  it  can 
seize the advantages of these new technologies. 

Other  community  involvements  of  mine,  which  range  from  having  served  as  Na-
tional  President  of  The  American  Jewish  Committee  to  membership  on  the  Boards 
of the University of Southern California, the Pacific Council for International Affairs 
and the Herrhausen Institute for International Dialogue of the Deutsche Bank, will 
also help me to contribute more meaningfully to CPB. 

If  I  am  confirmed,  my  hope  is  to  be  part  of  the  team  strengthening  an  evolving 
public  broadcasting  system  and  its  work  in  the  communities  across  our  country.  I 
am  committed  to  do  all  I  can  to  enhance  the  already  high  quality  of  public  broad-
casting  for  our  citizens  and  to  work  toward  even  wider  diversity  of  programming, 
be it news, education, information or entertainment—always with the singular pur-
pose of serving the interests of the American public. 

My  commitment  is  passionate  and  deep.  I  hope  to  have  the  opportunity  to  serve 
my  country  and  public  broadcasting  by  being  confirmed  as  a  member  of  the  Board 
of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  for  making  this  presentation  and  I  look  forward 

to answering any questions which any members of the Committee may have. 

Thank you.

According to the website of the House International Relations Committee, I testi-
fied (without indicating whether both orally and in writing or just in writing) before 
that Committee on behalf of the American Jewish Committee, relating to the treat-
ment of Israel by the United Nations. 

18.  Given  the  current  mission,  major  programs,  and  major  operational  objectives 
of  the  department/agency  to  which  you  have  been  nominated,  what  in  your  back-
ground  or  employment  experience  do  you  believe  affirmatively  qualified  you  for  ap-
pointment to the position for which you have been nominated, and why do you wish 
to serve in that position? 

I  have  been  a  supporter  of  and  involved  with  public  broadcasting  since  1992,  the 
year  in  which  I  joined  the  Board  of  Directors  of  KCET  (PBS),  Public  Television  for 
Southern California. I served as Chairman of that Board commencing 2001 with my 
term  expiring  in  2003.  I  serve  currently  as  the  Chair  of  the  Programming  Com-
mittee  of  the  Board  and  as  a  member  of  both  the  Audit  Committee  and  the  Execu-
tive Committee. 

In  addition,  I  have  been  a  practicing  attorney  in  the  entertainment,  communica-

tion and media business for over 40 years. 

I wish to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of the Corporation for Pub-
lic  Broadcasting  in  order  to  continue  to  work  for  and  in  support  of  public  broad-
casting. I believe that public broadcasting, whether radio or television, is a true and 
essential community asset and provides vital services, information, news, education 
and entertainment to the American public. I wish to do my part to preserve, protect 
and enhance that service. 

19. What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to ensure that the 
department/agency  has  proper  management  and  accounting  controls,  and  what  ex-
perience do you have in managing a large organization? 

If  confirmed,  my  responsibilities  will  be  those  of  a  director  with  dedicated  fidu-
ciary duties to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, exercising appropriate over-
sight  in  seeking  to  ensure  that  the  Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting  maintains 
proper management and accounting controls. 

My  experience  in  management  is  principally  that  involved  with  the  running  and

I  believe  that  the  top  three  challenges  facing  the  Corporation  for  Public  Broad-

(a)  to  secure  the  funding  which  will  enable  the  Corporation  to  continue  to  pro-
vide  grants  and  financial  assistance  in  program  production  and  the  enhance-
ment of the public broadcasting services; 
(b)  to  use  the  assets  of  the  Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting  wisely  in  pro-
viding public broadcasting services to the American people; and 
(c)  to  maintain  and  increase  viewership  of  public  television  and  listenership  of 
public  radio  in  order  to  provide  the  maximum  benefits  of  public  broadcasting 
to the widest possible segment of the American population. 

B. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 

1.  Describe  all  financial  arrangements,  deferred  compensation  agreements,  and 
other  continuing  dealings  with  business  associates,  clients,  or  customers.  Please  in-
clude information related to retirement accounts. 

As  a  member  of  Gang,  Tyre,  Ramer  &  Brown,  Inc.,  my  law  firm,  I  participate  in 
a  percentage  of  the  net  revenues  derived  from  the  firm  from  its  practice  of  law. 
There  is  no  deferred  compensation  agreement  as  such,  although  there  is  an  agree-
ment  which  provides  a  formula  for  payment  following  retirement  in  certain  cir-
cumstances  or  death.  As  to  retirement  accounts,  my  law  firm  maintains  a  401(k) 
program and I maintain an individual IRA. 

2.  Do  you  have  any  commitments  or  agreements,  formal  or  informal,  to  maintain 
employment, affiliation, or practice with any business, association or other organiza-
tion during your appointment? If so, please explain. 

Yes.  I  intend  to  continue  practicing  law  with  my  law  firm  and  to  maintain  my 

affiliations with charitable and community organizations. 

3.  Indicate  any  investments,  obligations,  liabilities,  or  other  relationships  which 
could  involve  potential  conflicts  of  interest  in  the  position  to  which  you  have  been 
nominated. 

I  believe  that  the  only  relationships  in  which  I  am  involved  which  could  involve 
potential conflicts of interest as a member of the Board of Directors of the Corpora-
tion  for  Public  Broadcasting  are  my  memberships  on  the  Board  of  Directors  of

KCET and on the Board of Trustees of the University of Southern California. I will 
recuse  myself  from  participation  in  any  matters  that  come  before  the  Board  of  the 
Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting  involving  either  of  these  entities,  whether  re-
specting grants or otherwise. 

Clients of my law firm are engaged in various aspects of the production of motion 
picture  and  television  and  related  products,  but,  with  one  exception,  I  do  not  recall 
any clients who have or contemplate seeking grants or other funding from the Cor-
poration for Public Broadcasting. If any should occur I will recuse myself. 

4.  Describe  any  business  relationship,  dealing,  or  financial  transaction  which  you 
have  had  during  the  last  10  years,  whether  for  yourself,  on  behalf  of  a  client,  or 
acting  as  an  agent,  that  could  in  any  way  constitute  or  result  in  a  possible  conflict 
of interest in the position to which you have been nominated: Please see the answer 
to B.3., above. 

5. Describe any activity during the past 10 years in which you have been engaged 
for the purpose of directly or indirectly influencing the passage, defeat, or modifica-
tion of any legislation or affecting the administration and execution of law or public 
policy. 

Please  see  the  answer  to  A.17  above.  In  addition,  particularly  in  my  capacity  as 
a member, officer or Governor of the American Jewish Committee, I have from time 
to  time  participated  in  discussions  with  Members  of  the  Senate  or  Members  of  the 
House  or  Members  of  the  Administration  pertaining  to  legislation  or  public  policy, 
but in a general way and not as a lobbyist. 

Similarly, I have attended several meetings with Members of the Senate or Mem-
bers  of  the  House  as  a  Trustee  of  the  University  of  Southern  California,  but  again 
not  as  a  lobbyist  but  rather  in  a  general  way  with  respect  to  legislation  or  public 
policy. 

6.  Explain  how  you  will  resolve  any  potential  conflict  of  interest,  including  any 

that may be disclosed by your responses to the above items. 

As  noted,  I  will  recuse  myself  in  any  situation  which  apparently  or  actually  pre-

sents a potential conflict of interest.

2.  Have  you  ever  been  investigated,  arrested,  charged,  or  held  by  any  Federal,

of  any  criminal  violation  other  than  a  minor  traffic  offense?  If  so,  please  explain: 
No. 

5.  Have  you  ever  been  accused,  formally  or  informally,  of  sexual  harassment  or 
discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex,  race,  religion,  or  any  other  basis?  If  so,  please 
explain: No.

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Mr. Ramer. 
And  may  I  now  call  upon  Ms.  Loretta  Sutliff?  I  gather  you  have 

family members here? 

STATEMENT OF LORETTA SUTLIFF, 

MEMBER-DESIGNATE, BOARD OF DIRECTORS, 
CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING 

Ms. SUTLIFF. Thank you. Yes, I would love the opportunity to in-

troduce my family. 

My  aunt,  Joan  Sutliff,  is  here  from  Bainbridge  Island,  Wash-
ington.  Also  our  daughter,  Olivia  Kathleen  Rice,  she’s  7  years  old. 
And  her  father,  my  husband,  John  Patrick  Rice,  from  Elko,  Ne-
vada,  where  John  also  serves  on  the  Elko  City  Council,  I  might 
add. 

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  very 
much for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss my 
nomination  to  the  Board  of  the  Corporation  for  Public  Broad-
casting. 

I would also like to extend my appreciation to President Bush for 
nominating  me  to  the  board  and  to  Senator  Reid  for  selecting  me 
for consideration. 

I  am  a  small-town  broadcaster  with  almost  25  years’  experience 
and accountability to my community. The more I understand about 
the  mission  of  public  television  and  radio,  the  more  I  realize  I  am 
uniquely qualified for this position. 

Our  town,  Elko,  Nevada,  is  located  some  160  miles  away  from 
the closest shopping mall, where our 7-year-old daughter can make 
her own teddy bear. We are surrounded by the fragile beauty of the 
high  desert,  rugged  glacier-carved  Ruby  Mountains,  and  an  eco-
system  rich  with  wildlife  unique  to  any  other  spot  on  the  planet. 
I  often  tell  family  and  friends  spread  across  the  country  that  we 
like to make our own fun. 

I  think  it  is  this  desert  experience  that  allows  the  spirit  of  indi-
vidualism  to  take  root,  endure,  and  thrive.  I  also  believe  the  Na-
tion’s  public  radio  and  television  stations  are  poised  to  emerge  as 
the  beacons  of  culture,  custom,  and  creative  spirit  as  more  of  our 
mainstream media options are further franchised and consolidated. 
I  work  in  commercial  radio  and  television  in  a  partnership  to 
provide  local  news  and  programming.  I  host  a  daily  radio  talk 
show,  ‘‘Elko  Live,’’  at  KELK,  which  has  been  on  the  air  for  almost 
15  years.  I  also  hosted  the  morning  radio  show  on  our  local  AM 
station  for  more  than  a  decade  until  our  daughter,  Olivia,  started 
kindergarten. 

Channel  10,  KENV,  is  a  local  NBC  television  affiliate  located  on 
the  Great  Basin  College  campus  under  arrangement  with  Sunbelt

Communications. My work at Elko Broadcasting Company is a con-
tinuation  of  a  family  owned  tradition  of  more  than  60  years.  Our 
radio  stations—KELK–AM,  KLKO–FM—are  deeply  committed  to 
community service in providing air time and talent to almost every 
charitable or beneficial cause in the region for decades. 

I  have  been  providing  weekday  newscasts  my  entire  broadcast 
career. As a result, I fully understand the responsibility of balanced 
and  accurate  reporting  and  the  accessibility  and  involvement  of 
broadcasters in the community. 

At  KENV–TV,  owned  by  Sunbelt  Communications,  I  am  very 
proud  to  work  with  and  for  some  of  the  most  inspiring  and  ener-
getic  people  in  our  community.  We  craft  a  half  hour  of  local  tele-
vision  news  each  weekday  and  Saturday  that  is  available  both  on-
line and on air. 

I  report,  edit,  produce,  and  anchor  segments  using  technology 
that  didn’t  exist  when  I  first  picked  up  a  grease  pencil  and  razor 
blade  to  splice  tape  on  reel-to-reel.  My  colleagues  and  I  are  con-
stantly  learning  and  sharing,  mentoring  and  encouraging,  an  atti-
tude I recognize in the heart of public broadcasting. 

As  broadcasters,  we  initiated  through  Great  Basin  College  the 
first broadcast technology program to recruit and train future com-
munity  broadcasters,  producers,  and  filmmakers.  This  program  is 
in  its  second  year,  and  we  have  already  seen  a  diversity  of  appli-
cants  from  a  local  historian—she  is  already  talented  in  conducting 
interviews—beginning her second career, to a young Shoshone stu-
dent  who  shared  her  culture  and  viewpoint  through  newly  devel-
oped skills in video production and outreach. 

What  I  hope  to  convey  in  this  statement  is  my  enthusiasm  and 
optimism  for  the  future  of  broadcasting,  especially  in  areas  that  I 
can see public radio and television setting the standard and reach-
ing  viewers  and  listeners  who  are  becoming  frustrated  with  the 
loss of local voices and views in their communities. I have both vi-
sion  and  skill  to  inspire  local  origination  broadcasting.  I  see  that 
service as key to the future of preserving our unique identities, the 
expression and soul of the place we live and the people we are. 

The  Public  Awareness  Initiative  is  an  example  of  how  public 
radio  and  television  station  leaders  can  increase  the  awareness  of 
how  public  broadcasting  enriches  and  informs  daily  life,  whether 
for  listeners  in  Owyhee,  Nevada,  a  remote  Western  Shoshone  res-
ervation, listening for a road report, or in Sparta, Wisconsin, where 
my mother-in-law, Barbara Rice, tunes in to hear ‘‘what NPR says’’ 
while  analyzing  national  politics.  Many  PBS  viewers  have  sought 
refuge  in  ‘‘The  News  Hour,’’  during  this  election  cycle  to  make 
sense of the sensations found elsewhere. 

The  Story  Corps  project  is  one  our  community  is  familiar  with 
because it is similar to local efforts by the Western Folklife Center 
in  Elko,  host  to  the  National  Cowboy  Poetry  Gathering,  now  cele-
brating  a  silver  year  anniversary,  in  launching  the  ‘‘Sheep  Camp 
for Stories.’’ A Basque sheep wagon was outfitted to record oral his-
tories  during 
the  winter  event.  Immigrants,  grandparents, 
craftspeople,  gold  miners,  sons  and  daughters  of  pioneer  families 
have  contributed  their  voices  to  this  priceless  archive,  more  valu-
able to the future than any trust fund.

While  there  are  challenges  and  mounting  costs  in  providing 
broadcast  signals,  especially  to  distant  and  rural  populations  such 
as  those  found  throughout  Nevada,  I  believe  an  even  bigger  chal-
lenge  not  measured  in  money  is  in  recruiting  and  retaining  tal-
ented  and  dedicated  future  broadcasters  who  want  to  serve  small- 
and  medium-sized  towns  covering  city  council  meetings  and  airing 
local  election  results,  adding  and  blending  local  voices,  opinions, 
and issues to that of national content. 

I  appreciate  the  Talent  Quest  mission  of  inspiring  and  moti-
vating our replacements. I believe expanded access to local origina-
tion  in  communities  and  on  campuses  will  foster  even  more  talent 
waiting to be discovered. 

I  would  be  sorely  remiss  if  I  did  not  also  applaud  PBS  for  its 
work in continuing the quality children’s educational programming 
I  grew  up  with  and  now  enjoyed  by  our  daughter.  From  the  main-
stay ‘‘Sesame Street,’’ with its ageless yet contemporary characters, 
to  new  and  vibrant  programs  such  as  ‘‘Between  the  Lions’’  and 
‘‘Maya  and  Miguel,’’  these  are  among  children’s  programming  on 
PBS that I know our daughter can watch. 

I  understand  well  the  mission  of  the  Corporation  for  Public 
Broadcasting, and I would be honored to serve on the Board of Di-
rectors for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 

Thank  you  for  considering  me,  and  I  would  be  happy  to  answer 

any questions.

on reel-to-reel. My colleagues and I are constantly learning and sharing, mentoring 
and encouraging, an attitude I recognize I n the heart of public broadcasting. 

As  broadcasters  we  initiated  through  Great  Basin  College,  the  first  Broadcast 
Technology  Program  to  recruit  and  train  future  community  broadcasters,  producers 
and  filmmakers.  This  program  is  in  its’  second  year  and  we  have  already  seen  a 
diversity  of  applicants,  from  a  local  historian,  already  talented  in  conducting  inter-
views,  beginning  her  second  career;  to  a  young  Shoshone  student  who  shared  her 
culture  and  viewpoint  through  newly-developed  skills  in  video  production  and  out-
reach. 

What  I  hope  to  convey  in  this  statement  is  my  enthusiasm  and  optimism  for  the 
future of broadcasting, especially in areas that I can see public radio and television 
setting  the  standard  and  reaching  viewers  and  listeners  who  are  becoming  frus-
trated  with  the  loss  of  local  voices  and  views  in  their  communities.  I  have  both  vi-
sion  and  skill  to  inspire  local  origination  broadcasting  and  see  that  service  as  key 
to  the  future  of  preserving  our  unique  identities;  the  expression  and  soul  of  the 
place we live and the people we are. 

The Public Awareness Initiative is an example of how public radio and television 
station leaders can increase the awareness of how public broadcasting enriches and 
informs daily life, whether for listeners in Owyhee, Nevada, a remote Western Sho-
shone  reservation  listening  for  a  road  report,  or  in  Sparta,  Wisconsin  where  my 
mother-in-law Barbara Rice tunes in to hear, ‘‘what NPR says,’’ while analyzing na-
tional  politics.  Many  PBS  viewers  have  sought  refuge  in  ‘‘The  News  Hour,’’  during 
this election cycle to make sense of the sensation found elsewhere. 

The  ‘‘Story  Corps’’  project  is  one  our  community  is  familiar  with.  It  is  similar  to 
a  local  effort  by  the  Western  Folklife  Center  in  Elko,  host  to  the  National  Cowboy 
Poetry  Gathering  now  celebrating  a  Silver  Year,  in  launching  the  ‘‘Sheep  Camp  for 
Stories.’’  A  Basque  sheep-wagon  was  outfitted  to  record  oral  histories  during  the 
winter  event.  Immigrants,  grandparents,  craftspeople,  gold  miners  and  sons  and 
daughters of pioneer families have contributed their voices to this priceless archive, 
more valuable to the future than any trust fund. 

While there are challenges and mounting costs in providing broadcast signals, es-
pecially  to  distant  and  rural  populations  such  as  those  found  throughout  Nevada, 
I  believe  an  even  bigger  challenge  not  measured  in  money  is  in  recruiting  and  re-
taining  talented  and  dedicated  future  broadcasters  who  want  to  serve  small-  and 
medium-sized towns, covering city council meetings and airing local election results, 
adding and blending local voices, opinions and issues to that of national content. 

I  appreciate  the  Talent  Quest  mission  of  inspiring  and  motivating  our  replace-
ments.  I  believe  expanded  access  to  local  origination  in  communities  and  on  cam-
puses will foster even more talent waiting to be discovered. 

I  would  be  sorely  remiss  if  I  did  not  also  applaud  PBS  for  its  work  in  continuing 
the quality children’s educational programming I grew up with, and now enjoyed by 
our  daughter.  From  the  mainstay,  ‘‘Sesame  Street,’’  with  its  ageless  yet  contem-
porary  characters,  to  new  and  vibrant  programs  such  as  ‘‘Between  the  Lions’’  and 
‘‘Maya and Miguel.’’ These are among children’s programming on PBS, that I know 
our daughter can watch. 

I  understand  well  the  mission  of  the  Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting  and  I 
would  be  honored  to  serve  on  the  board  of  directors  for  the  Corporation  for  Public 
Broadcasting.  Thank  you  for  considering  me  and  I  would  be  happy  to  answer  any 
questions.

pointment to which you have been nominated and why do you wish to serve in that

Given  the  Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting  mission  of  providing  universal  ac-
cess  to  high  quality  programming  and  services,  I  believe  my  long  career  as  a  rural 
journalist  and  broadcaster  gives  me  a  unique  ability  to  accomplish  a  number  of

tasks, communicate with a variety of interests and has developed a sense of service, 
especially  to  remote  populations.  I  understand  how  important  it  is  to  provide  local 
news, information and programming. 

19. What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to ensure that the 
department/agency  has  proper  management  and  accounting  controls,  and  what  ex-
perience do you have in managing a large organization? 

While  I  don’t  have  particular  experience  managing  a  corporation  or  overseeing  a 
large budget, I am prudent with the resources made available to me as an employee 
of  a  family-owned  business,  Elko  Broadcasting  Company,  KELK  and  KLKO  Radio 
Stations.  I  also  work  within  the  constraints  of  a  corporate  budget  as  provided  by 
Sunbelt Communications, owner of KENV TV. 

20.  What  do  you  believe  to  be  the  top  three  challenges  facing  the  department/ 

agency, and why? 

a. As a nominee for this position, I have not talked directly to any staff or agen-
cy  person.  In  my  own  experience  with  the  Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting, 
mostly  as  a  consumer,  1  realize  there  are  challenges  with  the  delivery  of  pro-
gramming  and  the  funding  required  to  maintain  systems  that  meet  FCC  and 
market technology demands. 
b. A second challenge, from my perspective as a nominee, is to continue to serve 
the underserved, particularly children and minorities, with local content. In my 
experience  as  a  rural  broadcaster,  I  see  less  local  programming  and  content 
being  made  available  to  consumers,  with  a  dwindling  reserve  of  talented  jour-
nalists  and  broadcasters  being  encouraged  to  pursue  careers  within  their  com-
munities. 
c.  A  third  perceived  challenge;  balancing  content  and  delivery  through  tech-
nology that is both informative and appealing to future generations of listeners 
and  viewers.  I  am  fortunate  to  work  with  exciting  and  talented  young  people 
and  believe  we  should  rely  on  the  upcoming  generation  to  help  shape  current 
and  future  content  and  explore  the  scope  of  delivery  of  news  and  information 
services. 

B. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 

1.  Describe  all  financial  arrangements,  deferred  compensation  agreements,  and 
other  continued  dealings  with  business  associates,  clients  or  customers.  Please  in-
clude information related to retirement accounts. 

I have a managed 401K account through Sunbelt Communications. Our daughter, 
a  529  College  Plan,  through  Great  Basin  Bank.  My  husband  has  a  403B  adminis-
tered through the State of Nevada and VALIC. 

2.  Do  you  have  any  commitments  or  agreements,  formal  or  informal,  to  maintain 
employment, affiliation, or practice with any business, association or other organiza-
tion during your appointment? If so, please explain. 

I will continue my full-time employment as News Director with Elko Broadcasting 
Company and Sunbelt Communications working in radio and television news in my 
community. If appointed to this position, I have been asked by the local newspaper, 
the Elko Daily Free Press, to submit an article detailing the appointment and offer-
ing insight as to the role of the CPB in rural communities. There would be no com-
pensation for this. 

3.  Indicate  any  investments,  obligations,  liabilities,  or  other  relationships  which 
could  involve  potential  conflicts  of  interest  in  the  position  to  which  you  have  been 
nominated. 

I  am  employed  by  commercial  broadcast  station  owners  who  have  been  openly 
supportive  of  Public  Broadcasting  and  our  relationships  to  service  in  our  commu-
nities. I do not anticipate anything but future support from both Elko Broadcasting 
Company  and  Sunbelt  Communications  if  I  were  to  be  appointed  to  this  position. 
4.  Describe  any  business  relationship,  dealing,  or  financial  transaction  which  you 
have  had  during  the  last  10  years,  whether  for  yourself,  on  behalf  of  a  client,  or 
acting  as  an  agent,  that  could  in  any  way  constitute  or  result  in  a  possible  conflict 
of interest in the position to which you have been nominated: None 

5. Describe any activity during the last 10 years in which you have been engaged 
for the purpose of directly or indirectly influencing the passage, defeat, or modifica-
tion of any legislation or affecting the administration and execution of law or public 
policy: None. 

6.  Explain  how  you  will  resolve  any  potential  conflict  of  interest,  including  any 

that may be disclosed by your responses to the above items. 

I am already in the practice of avoiding financial conflict of interest. As a working 
broadcaster,  I  do  not  accept  gifts  or  any  consideration  valued  at  more  than  $25.  If

47 

I were to be appointed to this position and were approached by any interest asking 
for  consideration  in  exchange  for  compensation,  I  would  report  the  incident  to  the 
appropriate ethics body. 

C. LEGAL MATTERS 

1.  Have  you  ever  been  disciplined  or  cited  for  a  breach  of  ethics  by,  or  been  the 
subject of a complaint to any court, administrative agency, professional association, 
disciplinary committee, or other professional group? If so, please explain: No. 

2.  Have  you  ever  been  investigated,  arrested,  charged,  or  held  by  any  Federal, 
State,  or  other  law  enforcement  authority  of  any  Federal,  State,  county,  or  munic-
ipal entity, other than for a minor traffic offense? If so, please explain: No. 

3.  Have  you  or  any  business  of  which  you  are  or  were  an  officer  even  been  in-
volved  as  a  party  in  an  administrative  agency  proceeding  or  civil  litigation?  If  so, 
please explain: No. 

4.  Have  you  ever  been  convicted  (including  pleases  of  guilty  or  nolo  contendere) 
of  any  criminal  violation  other  than  a  minor  traffic  offense?  If  so,  please  explain: 
No. 

5.  Have  you  ever  been  accused,  formally  or  informally,  of  sexual  harassment  or 
discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex,  race,  religion,  or  any  other  basis?  If  so,  please 
explain: No. 

6.  Please  advise  the  Committee  of  any  additional  information,  favorable  or  unfa-

vorable, which you feel should be disclosed in connection with your nomination. 

I  have  no  past  or  present  legal  involvements  or  professional  breaches  of  conduct. 
1  am  very  accountable  to  my  community  and  to  the  individuals  and  their  families 
represented in our news coverage. 

D. RELATIONSHIP WITH COMMITTEE 

1. Will you ensure that your department/agency complies with deadlines for infor-

mation set by congressional committees? 

Yes, I believe I have demonstrated my ability to meet deadlines as a requirement 

of my profession. I meet deadlines each day. 

2.  Will  you  ensure  that  your  department/agency  does  whatever  it  can  to  protect 
congressional  witnesses  and  whistle  blowers  from  reprisal  for  testimony  and  disclo-
sures? 

Yes, I believe my experience as a veteran broadcaster and news reporter has pre-
pared  me  to  protect  individuals  who  provide  information,  if  necessary.  If  appointed 
to this position, I would be vigilant in this role. 

3.  Will  you  cooperate  in  providing  the  Committee  with  requested  witnesses,  in-
cluding technical experts and career employees, with firsthand knowledge of matters 
of interest to the Committee? Yes. 

4.  Are  you  willing  to  appear  and  testify  before  any  duly  constituted  committee  of 
the  Congress  on  such  occasions  as  you  may  reasonably  be  requested  to  do  so?  Yes. 

RESUME OF LORETTA SUTLIFF 

CPB Board Nominee 

Loretta Sutliff began her work in broadcasting in 1983. Working under the broad-
cast name of ‘‘Lori Gilbert,’’ she has specialized in providing broadcast news in rural 
communities,  with  most  of  her  career  being  spent  as  the  news  director  for  Elko 
Broadcasting  Company’s  KELK  and  KLKO  in  Elko,  Nevada.  The  Associated  Press 
Television  and  Radio  Association  acknowledged  her  news  department  as  the  ‘‘News 
Station  of  the  Year’’  in  1999.  Her  daily  half-hour  community  news  program,  ‘‘Elko 
Live,’’  has  provided  listeners  throughout  northeastern  Nevada  with  first-person 
news  accounts  of  local,  regional  and  national  issues  and  events  for  nearly  fifteen 
years. 

In  1997  she  broadened  her  reach  and  her  responsibilities  as  the  founding  news 
director  and  anchor  of  KENV  News  10  in  Elko.  The  KENV  television  news  depart-
ment,  under  her  direction,  produces  news  shows  6  days  each  week.  She  also  pro-
duces and anchors a thirty minute weekly news program, featuring in-depth discus-
sions  with  community  leaders  on  topics  of  current  interest.  News  10  regularly  pro-
duces live community forums, including political debates between local, regional and 
state wide candidates. Her style of journalism holds local leadership accountable for 
their actions in ways no other media in the region requires, providing citizens with 
valuable  information  and  insight  for  formulating  opinions  about  the  direction  of 
their  community.  She  continues  to  work  on  the  air  in  both  radio  and  television

broadcasting,  and  is  consistently  recognized  by  news  organizations  for  her  out-
standing contributions to broadcast journalism. 

She  studied  communications  at  Weber  State  University  in  Ogden,  Utah.  She  has 
served as an adjunct instructor of journalism at Great Basin College in Elko, as well 
as  a  member  of  the  advisory  committee  to  the  community’s  public  television  and 
public radio signals, helping to bring public broadcasting service to viewers and lis-
teners  in  some  of  the  most  remote  reaches  of  rural  Nevada.  She  was  a  member  of 
the  board  of  directors  of  the  Associated  Press  Television  and  Radio  Association  of 
California  and  Nevada,  and  advised  association  members  on  rural  news  gathering 
and communications. She was recently inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters Hall 
of  Fame.  For  the  last  3  years  she  has  served  on  the  executive  board  of  Boys  and 
Girls Club of Elko, and is a past member of the board of directors of the Elko Coun-
ty  Family  Resource  Center  and  the  Elko  County  Juvenile  Advisory  Board.  She  is

She is married to Dr. John Patrick Rice, an Administrative Officer at Great Basin 

College. They have a daughter, Olivia, an elementary school student. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Ms. Sutliff. 
Senator Stevens? 
Senator Pryor? 
I  would  like  to  advise  the  panel  here  that  one  of  the  members 
has submitted several questions, and we would like to submit them 
to you, and may I suggest that you respond to them as soon as pos-
sible so that we can carry out this process before we adjourn? 

We  are  trying  our  best  to  fulfill  our  responsibilities  here.  But  as 
you  know,  we  may  be  out  of  Washington  in  2  weeks.  So  I  would 
expect all of you to do your part. 

I have a couple of questions to all of you. As you know, since its 
creation,  CPB  has  participated  in  programs,  radio  and  television, 
that appeal to minority audiences, diverse audiences. And we have 
this  consortia  now,  National  Minority  Consortia.  Just  want  to 
know, do you support this? 

Ms. Halpern? 
Ms. HALPERN. Forgive me. Thank you. 
As  the  Chairman  of  the  CPB  Board,  I  did  take  my  colleagues  to 
meet with both the Pacific Islanders, when we did visit Hawaii, as 
well  as  the  Native  American  consortia  leadership,  when  we  were 
out at the Hopi reservation in Arizona. 

We  are  currently  reviewing  how  to,  in  fact,  engage  more  effec-
tively with the consortia. And after the review is concluded, I know 
that the CPB staff will come and brief the Committee staff as well. 
But  there  is  an  absolute  commitment  by  the  current  CPB  Board, 
myself,  if  renominated,  and  I  am  assuming  the  new  nominees  as 
well, to be all we can be to every underserved or unserved audience 
as legislated. 

The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Ramer? 
Mr.  RAMER.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  short  answer  is,  yes,  absolutely. 
I  noted  in  my  opening  statement  a  reference  to  the  need  of  public 
broadcasting  to  serve  all  the  elements  of  an  increasingly  diverse 
population,  and  I  think  that  is  an  essential  part  of  what  public 
broadcasting does, and I support the minority consortia. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Ms. Sembler? 
Ms.  SEMBLER.  I  would  agree.  I  do  support  it,  and  I  believe  that 
the  mission—one  of  the  missions  of  public  broadcasting  is  edu-
cation, and I would certainly like to see national programming that 
is reflective of what the consortia is doing.

The CHAIRMAN. Ms. Sutliff? 
Ms. SUTLIFF. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I,  too,  believe  wholeheartedly  in  this  minority  consortium,  and 
especially coming from rural Nevada, we know what it feels like to 
be  a  minority  population.  And  we  have  important  cultures  to  be 
represented  within  our  communities  as  well.  So,  thank  you,  and 
again speaking as a nominee. 

The CHAIRMAN. Senator Pryor? 
Senator DAVID PRYOR. Yes, Mr. Chairman, thank you. 
I  think,  in  a  new  sense  of  transparency,  especially  in  the  last  3 
years  for  the  board  of  the  Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting, 
Board  and  its  staff,  there  is,  in  fact,  a  new  sense  of  transparency 
which does result, Mr. Chairman, in your finding and the Commit-
tee’s  staff  finding  that  a  great  portion  of  our  discussions  in  our 
Board meeting has been dedicated to the concept that public broad-
casting,  radio  and  television,  must  be  totally  open  to  every  group 
and  every  portion  of  this  country,  regardless  of  race,  color,  creed, 
geographic region, et cetera. 

And  therefore,  I  feel  truly  a  bursting  new  commitment  to  ful-
filling  of  this  sense  of  fairness  throughout  our  country,  and  I  hope 
that  our  Committee  staff  members  on  the  Commerce  Committee 
and  also  would  avail  themselves  of  looking  sort  of  into  the  record 
to  see  how  much  time  and  commitment  we  are  having  at  this  mo-
ment to making this become definitely a reality. 

Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much. 
I have just one more question. As you know, on February 17 next 
year,  we  will  switch  from  analog  to  digital  signals.  Do  you  believe 
that  all  public  broadcasting  stations,  radio  and  TV,  are  ready  for 
this? 

Ms. Halpern? 
Ms. HALPERN. In this regard, I especially want to say thank you 
to  the  Senate—actually,  to  Congress—for  providing  the  additional 
sources  of  funding  to  allow  for  the  transition  for  the  public  broad-
casting  system  to  digital.  To  date,  there  are  but  15  stations  that 
are in the process of yet converting to digital. 

But more importantly, I need to applaud the public broadcasting 
family for the manner in which they are engaging with their audi-
ences,  their  listeners  and  their  viewers.  They  are  effectively  deliv-
ering  messages  regarding  the  converter  boxes,  how  to  access,  how 
to  become  more  comfortable  with  what  will  be  forthcoming  in  Feb-
ruary 2009. 

ready? 

Thank you. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Mr.  Pryor,  Senator  Pryor,  do  you  think  we  are 

Senator  DAVID PRYOR.  Mr.  Chairman,  with  all  due  respect,  I 
think  we  are  getting  ready.  And  I  think  by  February,  we  will  be 
there.  And  I  think  this  is  an  exciting  moment.  It  is  an  exciting 
transition  and  development  in  the  broadcast  industry.  Once  again, 
it  will  serve  more  and  more  Americans  more  fairly  and,  I  think, 
even more efficiently. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, yes. 
The CHAIRMAN. I thank you.

Senator  STEVENS.  I  wonder  what  role  the  Board  has  in  terms  of 
looking  at  broad  issues  and  whether  they  should  be  sort  of  head-
lined  by  the  stations  involved  that  you  oversee.  For  instance,  and 
it  is  provincial,  the  Chairman  and  I  represent  two  new  states.  We 
will  celebrate  our  50th  anniversary,  each  of  us,  on  January  3  of 
next  year.  Alaska  and  Hawaii  will  have  been  a  state  for  50  years. 
As a matter of fact, it took 45 years for us to get statehood once 
we started that. I think Hawaii just slightly longer. But I just won-
der, does your board go into and look at events ahead and ask the 
stations  to  recognize  these  events,  or  is  this  something  that  you 
don’t get involved in? 

Yes, anyone? I don’t care. 
Ms. HALPERN. Senator—— 
The CHAIRMAN. If you want his vote, you better give the right an-

Ms.  HALPERN.—the  CPB  board  is  not  allowed  by  law  to  get  in-
volved  with  programming.  But  I  would  hope  that  the  stations  in 
Alaska,  as  well  as  in  Hawaii,  given  their  responsibilities  as  local 
public broadcasters, would certainly be celebrating the anniversary 
of statehood. 

When  we  visited  Alaska  and  we  went,  in  fact,  up  to  Bethel,  we 
were able to, as a board, listen to the type of programming that the 
stations  provide,  and  the  special  connection,  the  life  system  that, 
for  example,  ‘‘Tundra  Drums’’  provides  in  Bethel  to  those  of  the 
Inuit  communities  who  become  completely  isolated  when  that  tun-
dra  thaws  is  remarkable,  unique,  and  so  very  special.  So  I  cannot 
but imagine that they will do everything. 

Senator STEVENS. Oh, I am sure they will in our state. I am talk-
ing  about  nationally.  You  don’t  have  anything  to  do  with  that, 
right? 

Ms. HALPERN. That we do not, sir. 
Senator STEVENS. Thank you very much. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  With  that,  I  would  like  to  once  again  request 
that  you  respond  to  the  questions  that  the  Committee  will  submit 
to you, and the sooner we do this, we can expedite the process. 

Once again, thank you very much for your appearance here. And 

Senator Pryor, give my regards to Arkansas. 

Senator  DAVID PRYOR.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you 

very much. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  And  with  that,  we  will  try  to  speed  up  the  proc-

ess. Thank you very much. 

[Whereupon, at 11:23 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

A P P E N D I X 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BYRON L. DORGAN TO 

ALL CPB NOMINEES 

Question  1.  Public  television  offers  some  of  the  last  locally-owned  and  controlled 
media in this country. Subsequently, its role in the marketplace of media is becom-
ing  increasingly  important  as  we  search  for  diverse  opinions  and  voices.  In  fact,  a 
2003  study  by  the  McGannon  Center  found  that  over  a  2-week  period,  commercial 
broadcasters aired, on average, only 45 minutes of local public affairs programming 
per  week,  in  contrast  to  the  3.5  hours  aired  by  public  broadcasters.  How  important 
do you see the role of public broadcasters as leaders in local programming? 

Ms. HALPERN. I believe public broadcasting is a national treasure, and an invalu-
able  community  connector.  In  most  communities,  the  public  broadcasting  station  is 
the last locally-owned media operation and the only vehicle for significant discourse 
on local issues. If confirmed for a second term, I want to make sure that we protect 
and enhance the opportunities for public broadcasting entities across our country to 
provide this valuable connection through local programming. 

Ms.  GILBERT.  This  is  an  extremely  important  issue  to  me.  I  believe  public  radio 
and  television  broadcasters  will  have  an  even  greater  role  in  providing  local  news 
and  programming  in  the  near  future  as  competition  and  costs  continue  to  squeeze 
commercial interests. I believe public broadcasting may soon be one of the only out-
lets to provide continued free access and information throughout the country. 

Mr. RAMER. I believe that public broadcasting is basically the last bastion of local 
broadcasting. For example, in my City of Los Angeles, KCET is the only ‘‘local’’ tele-
vision station. In my opinion, while there are many reasons why public broadcasting 
is an essential for our Nation and a healthy democracy, having local stations is one 
of the most important reasons. 

Ms. SEMBLER. My 15 years of service at WEDU, the Tampa Bay area’s public tele-
vision station, has taught me the importance of localism. It is only our station that 
offers  a  weekly  public  affairs  program,  Florida  This  Week,  in  prime  time  on  Friday 
evenings;  only  our  station  that  produces  and  broadcasts  two  interview  shows,  one 
spotlighting local community leaders, the other, local business leaders; and our sta-
tion  alone  that,  through  the  generous  funding  of  a  community  foundation,  presents 
A  Gulf  Coast  Journal  with  Jack  Perkins,  a  show  that  highlights  the  people  and 
places  of  Sarasota  and  west  central  Florida.  Additionally,  WEDU  has  provided  our 
viewers with many special broadcasts about aspects of our local community, includ-
ing  shows  that  focused  on  the  African-American  community  of  St.  Petersburg,  FL, 
the  Ringling  Museum  in  Sarasota,  FL  and  the  Mote  Marine  Laboratory,  also  in 
Sarasota,  to  name  but  a  few.  WEDU  also  produces  local  offerings  to  dovetail  with 
PBS programming (such as our local follow-up to The War series by Ken Burns, and 
our  local  ‘‘town  hall’’  forum  in  response  to  Judy  Woodruff  s  production  Generation 
Next). 

WEDU is not alone. All across America, public television stations follow a similar 
formula  to  provide  a  perfect  mix  of  local  and  PBS  programming.  It  is  what  makes 
public  television  unique  and,  in  my  opinion,  superior  to  all  other  television  avail-
able. 

Additionally, and perhaps even more significantly, WEDU and public TV stations 
across  the  country  reach  out  into  the  local  community  with  our  signature  literacy 
program, Ready To Learn. 

Public  television  is  truly  THE  leader  in  local  programming.  It  is  critically  impor-

tant for public broadcasters to continue in this role in our local communities. 

Question  2.  The  Board  of  the  Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting  serves  a  very 
important  role  and  while  it  is  not  supposed  to  interfere  with  content,  as  we  saw  in 
2005, the CPB Board has tried in the past. You will recall that in 2005, then-Chair-
man  Kenneth  Tomlinson  tried  to  influence  public  broadcasting  programming  and 
hired a consultant to track the political leanings of the guests on Bill Moyers’ show 
‘‘Now.’’ What is your opinion of Tomlinson’s actions?

52 

Ms. HALPERN. In 2005; as part of the arrangement which terminated Mr. Tomlin-
son’s  association  with  CPB,  the  Board  of  Directors  signed  an  agreement  which  pre-
vent  us  even  today  from  publicly  commenting  on  his  tenure  as  CPB  Board  Chair-
man.  Regardless  of  the  former  Chairman’s  actions,  CPB  has  not  since  hired  a  con-
sultant for any such purpose and, in fact, I would oppose any such a hire as a mem-
ber of the CPB Board of Directors. 

Ms.  GILBERT.  As  a  nominee  to  the  CPB,  I  have  no  firsthand  information  of  the 
controversy  surrounding  the  previous  Chairman.  I  would  not  care  to  comment  on 
specifics except to say, I intend that the past issues and controversy will inform bet-
ter decisions and actions by the Board in the future. 

Mr.  RAMER.  Attempts  on  the  part  of  CPB,  its  management  or  its  Board,  to  inter-
fere  with  or  influence  the  content  of  public  broadcasting  is  inappropriate  and  flies 
in the face of the statutory imperatives. 

Ms.  SEMBLER.  It  is  important  to  me,  whenever  I  serve  on  a  Board,  to  follow  the 
guidelines  and  by-laws  of  the  organization.  I  have  learned  over  the  course  of  this 
nomination process that CPB’s statute prohibits CPB from interfering with local sta-
tion  operation  or  controlling  editorial  content  or  programming.  I  am  in  agreement 
with  this  prohibition,  and  if  confirmed,  I  will  work  to  ensure  that  CPB  complies 
fully with the directives of the Public Broadcasting Act. 

Question  3.  Does  public  broadcasting  accurately  reflect  the  diversity  and  variety 
of  ideological  views  of  Americans?  Do  you  believe  public  broadcasting  stations 
present balanced news coverage on local, national and international affairs? 

Ms.  HALPERN.  Across  the  entire  programming  schedule,  and  especially  in  news 
and  current  affairs  programming,  I  believe  public  broadcasting  offers  the  most  bal-
anced  news  coverage  of  any  news  outlet  in  America.  Programs  like  The  Newshour 
with  Jim  Lehrer  offer  a  variety  of  opinions  on  almost  every  issue  discussed  every 
night,  representing  a  diversity  and  variety  of  views  reflective  of  Americans  across 
our country. 

Ms.  GILBERT.  As  a  nominee  to  the  CPB,  my  comments  are  those  of  a  consumer. 
I sincerely appreciate the educational, cultural and historical aspects of public tele-
vision.  I  watch  The  NewsHour  on  PBS  to  get  more  accurate,  less  sensational  views 
of national and international issues, especially after feeling there is too much opin-
ion injected in commercial broadcasts. It’s possible that NPR could do more to reflect 
regional and local issues in radio markets although I believe that opinion should be 
supported by community and management perspective. 

Mr.  RAMER.  I  also  believe  that  public  broadcasting  news  programs—both  tele-
vision  and  radio—seek  to  present  balanced  and  objective  news  locally,  nationally 
and internationally and certainly succeed far beyond that of commercial sources. 

Ms.  SEMBLER.  Yes,  I  believe  that  public  broadcasting  offers  a  variety  of  balanced 
news  and  current  affairs  programming,  both  nationally  and  at  the  local  level.  At 
WEDU in Tampa, we offer the public affairs program that I mentioned above, Flor-
ida  This  Week.  On  this  program,  along  with  a  moderator,  the  producers  always  in-
clude  four  individual  commentators  who  represent  the  varied  parts  of  the  political 
and  community  spectrum.  Each  week,  white,  African-American,  and  Latino  leaders 
and  thinkers  articulate  viewpoints  that  are  conservative,  liberal,  and  points  in  be-
tween. I am proud that WEDU works hard to create programming such as this that 
is balanced, fair and representational of the community it serves. 

I  believe  that  national  programming  reflects  this  as  well  and  strives  to  present 
balanced news coverage on national and international affairs. Programs such as The 
NewsHour  with  Jim  Lehrer  and  Washington  Week,  for  example,  are  well-respected 
for their balance. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BYRON L. DORGAN TO 

CHERYL FELDMAN HALPERN 

Question  1.  In  2003,  when  you  testified  before  the  Senate  Commerce  Committee, 
Senator  Lott  said  journalist  Bill  Moyers’s  post-election  commentary  was:  ‘‘the  most 
blatantly  partisan,  irresponsible  thing  I’ve  ever  heard  in  my  life,’’  and  said,  yet  the 
CPB  ‘‘has  not  seemed  to  be  willing  to  deal  with  Bill  Moyers  and  that  type  of  pro-
gramming.’’  You  responded:  ‘‘The  fact  of  the  matter  is,  I  agree  with  you.’’  And  you 
said, referring to your time with the Broadcasting Board of Governors, ‘‘when there 
were  allegations  of  impropriety  and  violation  of  the  journalistic  code  of  ethics,  we 
were  able  to  aggressively  step  in,  review  the  transcript  . . .  and  initiate  penalties 
and change accordingly.’’ This was prior to Tomlinson’s attempt to address the pro-
gramming  of  Bill  Moyers.  You  acknowledged  that  the  CPB  cannot  do  this,  yet  you 
said  to  Senator  Lott:  ‘‘so  I’m  as  frustrated  as  you.’’  Can  you  tell  me  how  you  differ 
from Kenneth Tomlinson in your views?

Answer. Unlike the former Chairman, if confirmed for a second term, I will keep, 
and  have  kept,  my  personal  opinions  about  the  programs  on  public  broadcasting 
separate  from  the  discharge  of  my  duties  as  a  CPB  Board  member.  Foremost 
amongst these duties is to, in the words of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, ‘‘as-
sure  the  maximum  freedom  of  the  public  telecommunications  entities  and  systems 
from interference with, or control of, program content or other activities.’’ 

Question  2.  If  you  disagreed  with  Tomlinson’s  actions,  why  did  I  not  hear  you 

speak out in 2005, or preferably earlier to prevent them from occurring? 

Answer. In 2004 and 2005, Chairman Tomlinson acted as an executive Chairman 
of  the  Board  and,  as  many  media  reports  acknowledged  at  the  time,  many  of  his 
actions  took  place  without  the  knowledge  of  the  Board.  Again,  in  2005,  as  part  of 
the  arrangement  which  terminated  Mr.  Tomlinson’s  association  with  CPB,  the 
Board of Directors signed an agreement which prevent us from publicly commenting 
on his tenure as CPB Board Chairman. 

Question  3.  Do  you  believe  that  the  Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting  should 
assess purported political bias in public broadcasting content through the use of in-
ternal or external content analysis? 

Answer. No. CPB should not assess purported political bias in public broadcasting 
content.  However,  we  are  charged  with  complying  with  the  mandate  of  the  Public 
Broadcasting  Act,  which  requires  the  CPB’s  Board  of  Directors  to  establish  a  ‘‘com-
prehensive  policy  and  set  of  procedures,’’  that,  among  other  things,  provide  for  reg-
ular review of national public broadcasting programming for objectivity and balance. 
In  the  2005  report  from  CPB’s  Inspector  General,  he  recommended  that  the  CPB 
Board establish formal policies and procedures for conducting regular reviews of na-
tional programming for objectivity and balance. 

In  beginning  to  address  the  IG’s  recommendation,  CPB  and  the  Board  consulted 
with  the  deans  of  the  Nation’s  top  schools  of  journalism,  the  Project  for  Excellence 
in  Journalism,  public  broadcasters  including  National  Public  Radio  (NPR)  and  the 
Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), relevant interest groups and others. 

Frankly,  these  discussions  produced  no  clear  consensus,  with  some  stating  the 
language of the Congressional mandate is either unclear or archaic according to the 
standards  of  modern  journalism,  and  others  urging  CPB  to  focus  instead  on  its 
‘‘most  important’’  role  of  insulating  public  broadcasters  from  outside  pressures  and 
protecting their independence. 

The  Board  subsequently  requested  that  CPB  management  obtain  research  based 
on  insights  from  the  journalism  community  that  could  better  inform  our  efforts  to 
address the Public Broadcasting Act’s requirements. 

Accordingly, in the winter of 2007, CPB issued seven requests for proposal (RFPs) 
for  white  papers,  the  topics  for  which  are:  (1)  Objectivity  and  Balance:  Conceptual 
and Practical History in American Journalism; (2) Objectivity and Balance: Today’s 
Best practices in American Journalism; (3) Objectivity and Balance: How do Readers 
and  Viewers  of  News  and  Information  Reach  conclusions  regarding  Objectivity  and 
Balance?;  (4)  Journalism  When  Government  Supports  the  Enterprise;  (5)  Concepts 
in  Tension:  the  Challenge  of  ensuring  Both  Objectivity  and  Balance  and  Editorial 
Independence;  (6)  Best  Practices  in  Assessing  Objectivity  and  Balance;  and  (7)  Ex-
pectations  for  Objectivity  and  Balance  in  Multi-Platform  Distribution—Traditional 
and New Media. 

At  the  end  of  July,  four  white  papers  were  submitted  to  CPB:  ‘‘Objectivity  and 
Balance:  Conceptual  and  Practical  History  in  American  Journalism’’;  ‘‘Objectivity 
and Balance: Today’s Best practices in American Journalism’’; ‘‘Objectivity and Bal-
ance:  How  do  Readers  and  Viewers  of  News  and  Information  Reach  conclusions  re-
garding Objectivity and Balance’’; and ‘‘Concepts in Tension: the Challenge of ensur-
ing Both Objectivity and Balance and Editorial Independence.’’ 

In  early  August,  the  authors  of  three  of  the  papers  participated  in  a  workshop 
at the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication conference 
in Chicago. 

This  resulted  in  offers  of  assistance  from  several  independent  journalism  entities 
to help us as well as a proposal for the White Paper on ‘‘Expectations for Objectivity 
and Balance in Multi-Platform Distribution—Traditional and New Media.’’ 

Going  forward,  CPB  will  be  integrating  the  findings  of  the  white  papers;  Arrang-
ing for the white papers to be formally presented at national journalism conferences 
in  2009;  working  with  at  least  two  independent  journalism  entities  on  our  further 
research needs as well as the development of a web-based training initiative on jour-
nalism and ethics which will include a module on balance, objectivity, fairness, accu-
racy  and  transparency  directed  toward  professionals,  academics  and  lay  persons 
alike; and sponsoring a national symposium on the impact of digital media on jour-
nalism.  At  the  same  time,  CPB  will  also  continue  to  work  with  stakeholders  in  the

public  broadcasting  system  on  the  issue  of  editorial  independence  as  well  as  on  ob-
jectivity and balance. 

We  will  make  sure  to  keep  you  and  your  staff  abreast  of  our  efforts  to  meet  our 

statutory ‘‘objectivity and balance’’ mandate. 

Question  4.  What  level  of  autonomy  do  you  believe  should  be  given  to  news  pro-

gramming decisions made by public broadcasters? 

Answer. I believe they should be given complete autonomy. 
Question 5. Have you taken any action during your tenure on the Corporation for 

Public Broadcasting to influence the direction or outcome of programming? 

Answer. No, I have not. 
Question  6.  Were  you  calling  for  more  Board  transparency  and  checks  and  bal-
ances on the Board before the Tomlinson actions and before the Inspector General’s 
report was issued? 

Answer.  It  was  not  until  after  I  assumed  the  Chairmanship  of  the  CPB  Board  of 
Directors  that  we  initiated  a  top-to-bottom  review  of  CPB’s  operations  and  proce-
dures.  Never  before  had  our  organization  undertaken  such  a  major  examination  of 
every  task,  operation  and  practice.  During  this  time,  we  made  significant  revisions 
to our governance procedures, established more clearly defined roles and responsibil-
ities  for  the  Board  Chari  and  for  the  CPB  President  and  CEO,  improving  account-
ability and transparency in the operations of the our organization. 

I am very proud of our work, and I believe we addressed and continue to address 
many  of  the  issues  identified  in  the  2005  report  of  the  Inspector  General,  and  in 
so  doing,  we  have  created  an  atmosphere  of  transparency,  integrity,  ethical  values 
and  clear  assignments  of  authority  and  responsibility  for  the  CPB  board  and  staff. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BYRON L. DORGAN TO 

BRUCE M. RAMER 

Question 1. Former Chairman Kenneth Tomlinson believed that programming cre-
ated  by  public  broadcasting  was  partisan  and  biased.  Do  you  share  these  views?  If 
yes,  do  you  believe,  as  the  former  Chairman  did,  that  the  Board  should  be  able  to 
take corrective action? 

Answer. I do not believe that public broadcasting is partisan or biased. 
Question 2. Do you plan to attempt to influence the direction or outcome of public 

broadcasting programming? 

Answer. No. 
Question  3.  What  do  you  think  of  the  value  or  depth  of  news  and  information  on 

public broadcasting as compared to other news sources? 

Answer.  Based  upon  my  knowledge  of  what  is  broadcast  by  public  broadcasting 
and by commercial broadcasters, I believe that there is more depth of the news and 
information on the public system than on commercial broadcasting. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BYRON L. DORGAN TO 

ELIZABETH SEMBLER 

Question 1. Based on your experience with public broadcasting in Tampa and with 
the  Association  for  Public  Television  Stations  (APTS),  what  are  the  greatest  chal-
lenges public broadcasting faces in the near future? 

Answer.  In  my  opening  statement,  I  identified  three  areas  that  I  believe  present 

the greatest challenges for public broadcasting in the near future: 

A.  The  February  17,  2009  analog  shut-off  for  television  broadcasts.  Of  the  esti-
mated 25 million Americans who receive their television programming over the 
air  (and  who  will  need  to  do  the  most  to  transition  to  digital  reception),  a  sig-
nificant  number  are  supporters  and  viewers  of  public  television.  Public  broad-
casters  must  work  hard  with  commercial  broadcasters  and  the  Congress  to  en-
sure  the  success  of  the  transition  and  ensure  that  the  audience  for  public  tele-
vision can find its programming. 
B.  Competition  in  a  multi-channel,  multi-platform  universe.  It  is  imperative 
that  public  broadcasting  is  on  the  cutting  edge  of  media  technology  to  reach 
viewers and listeners on the media outlets they choose to use. 
C. Funding. This continues to be a great challenge for public broadcasting, and 
the Federal Government’s role is even more important now as we head into the 
digital age. While Federal funding of public broadcasting may only represent 15 
percent  of  total  revenue,  this  15  percent  is  essential  in  garnering  support  from 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:49 Apr 23, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00058 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80430.TXT JACKIE

other  sources.  While  CPB  have  lately  received  modest  increases  for  our  ad-
vanced Federal funding, this has hardly kept pace with inflation. 

55 

Question  2.  Do  you  believe  the  Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting  should  be 

granted more authority to address claims of bias? 

Answer. No. While I do believe that the public certainly has the right to respond 
to  and  comment  on  public  broadcasting,  I  am  not  convinced  that  the  CPB  itself 
should  address  claims  of  bias.  Suffice  it  to  say,  I  am  comfortable  with  the  param-
eters  that  now  define  the  CPB’s  role  in  this  area,  and  do  not  think  it  is  wise  to 
change them. 

Question  3.  Are  you  committed  to  transparency  on  the  Corporation  for  Public 

Broadcasting and how can the CPB’s transparency be improved? 

Answer.  Yes,  and  if  confirmed  I  will  work  to  ensure  transparency  remains  at  the 
forefront of all of CPB’s operations. CPB is a federally-funded and thus public insti-
tution; the public has the right to know about its workings. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BYRON L. DORGAN TO 

LORETTA SUTLIFF 

Question  1.  What  are  your  views,  regarding  the  importance  of  localism  to  the  fu-

ture of public broadcasting? 

Answer.  I  feel  very  strongly  that  if  public  broadcasting  does  not  strengthen  the 
current  commitment  to  providing  local  news  and  programming,  future  generations 
will be forced to subscribe to or ‘‘purchase’’ only franchised information. Local news 
coverage  is  also  very  important  to  the  balance  of  government  and  law  enforcement 
in  any  community.  I  understand  that  Senator  Dorgan  is  concerned  about  the  inci-
dence of violent crime on Native American reservations, as is our community. Great-
er scrutiny by local media is a form of public protection. 

Question 2. What value has localism in public broadcasting brought to your rural 

Nevada community? 

Answer. I recognize the value that public broadcasting’s local focus brings to com-
munities, large and small, across the country. Furthermore, as a small town broad-
caster  with  almost  twenty-five  years’  experience,  localism  is  what  my  job  is  all 
about.  In  fact,  in  the  time  I’ve  been  sitting  at  my  desk  to  answer  these  questions 
I’ve received phone calls ranging from a Nevada Forester hoping to promote a local 
tree sale, to the Chairman of the Elko Area Chamber of Commerce as we’re coordi-
nating a series of candidate debates, including a televised forum featuring the U.S. 
Congressional  Race  for  the  2nd  District  in  Northern  Nevada.  Our  involvement  is  a 
direct reflection of a busy community that relies on us. As a commercial broadcaster
