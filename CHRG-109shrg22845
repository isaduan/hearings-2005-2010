U.S.  TSUNAMI  WARNING  SYSTEM  AND  S.  50, 
‘‘THE  TSUNAMI  PREPAREDNESS  ACT  OF  2005’’

WEDNESDAY,  FEBRUARY  2,  2005

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10  a.m.  in  room  SR–
253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Ted  Stevens,  Chairman 
of the Committee, presiding. 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS,

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Welcome  to  our  first  hearing.  We’re  honored  to 
have  Senate  Majority  Leader  Bill  Frist  and,  soon,  Senator  Mary 
Landrieu  here  to  testify  on  their  recent  trip  to  the  countries  im-
pacted  by  the  Indian  Ocean  tsunami.  We  do  thank  them  for  their 
willingness to come. 

In  1994,  Senator  Inouye  and  I,  along  with  Senator  Hatfield  of 
Oregon,  directed  NOAA  to  develop  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard 
Mitigation  Program.  We  had  had  a  tsunami  in  1968,  after  the 
earthquake.  But  this  was  in  response  to  a  small  tsunami  that  im-
pacted the West Coast. It reflected the concern we all shared about 
the  frequency  of  tsunamis  in  the  Pacific.  This  bill  is  intended  to 
build on the current tsunami warning network that we have in the 
Pacific. 

I thank the witnesses for being here today. 
Let me yield to Senator Inouye, our Co-Chairman. 

STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE,

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

Senator  INOUYE.  I’d  like  to  join  our  Chairman  in  welcoming  our 
distinguished panel of witnesses, especially the Leader, as they tes-
tify  on  a  catastrophe  that  has  left  the  world  in  shock,  and  govern-
ments scrambling to react. 

We  all  saw  the  devastation,  the  incredible  human  suffering,  and 
the obliteration of entire communities. The destruction hit everyone 
and  everything  in  its  path,  without  regard  to  national  or  ethnic 
identity, level of economic development, or technological sophistica-
tion. 

Our response, as a global community, must, similarly, cut across 
superficial  distinctions  among  nations  and  people.  Our  response, 
however, must not be a disorderly surge of activity and investment 
dictated by emotions.

Mr.  Chairman,  may  I  request  that  the  rest  of  my  statement  be 

made part of the record? 

[The prepared statement of Senator Inouye follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 
I  would  like  to  join  our  Chairman  in  welcoming  our  distinguished  panel  of  wit-
nesses today. As they testify on a catastrophe that has left the world in shock, and 
governments  scrambling  to  react.  The  tsunami  that  struck  the  coasts  of  the  Indian 
Ocean  struck  without  regard  to  national  or  ethnic  identity,  level  of  economic  devel-
opment, or technological sophistication. I believe that our response as a global com-
munity must similarly cut across superficial distinctions among nations and peoples. 
That response, however, must not be a disorderly surge of activity and investment 
dictated  by  emotions.  Rather,  we  must  study  carefully  the  nature  of  the  threat  of 
tsunami,  assess  our  capacity  for  detecting  and  forecasting  these  natural  disasters, 
and make a plan that both makes sense, and is sustainable over time. 

Protecting  human  life  and  property  from  natural  disaster  requires  the  ability  to 
reliably  detect  and  forecast,  the  capacity  to  broadcast  warnings  in  a  timely  and  in-
formative  manner,  and  the  knowledge  in  communities  of  how  to  respond  and  evac-
uate to safety. Above all, however, it requires the willingness to invest resources to 
prepare  for  a  threat  that  is  largely  unseen  and  unpredictable—until  the  last  mo-
ment, when a monstrous wave actually strikes. 

As  we  came  to  understand  the  broader  threat  that  tsunami  posed,  Ted  Stevens 
and  I  worked  together  in  1994  to  direct  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Ad-
ministration  (NOAA)  to  develop  a  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program.  We  are 
pleased  to  report  that  this  program  has  laid  the  foundation  for  tsunami  prepared-
ness  in  the  Pacific.  The  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  has 
taken  the  lead  in  this  effort  with  support  from  other  federal  partners,  such  as  the 
U.S.  Geological  Survey,  and  the  National  Science  Foundation.  We  look  forward  to 
hearing  reports  and  testimony  from  these  agencies  as  they  describe  where  their 
work has brought us today. 

The  appalling  scope  of  the  Indian  Ocean  tragedy  illustrates  the  importance  and 
necessity  of  our  work  of  the  past  10  years,  and  with  stark  clarity,  we  can  see  that 
despite  our  best  efforts,  much  remains  to  be  done.  Now,  as  before,  Senator  Stevens 
and I have come together to lead the charge toward national and international tsu-
nami  preparedness  by  introducing  our  bill,  S.  50,  the  Tsunami  Preparedness  Act, 
which many of our colleagues here in this room have chosen to cosponsor. 

I  hope  that  today’s  testimony  will  shed  additional  light  on  how  we  may  further 
improve  our  bill  and  come  to  grips  with  national  and  global  tsunami  preparedness. 
In  particular,  I  look  forward  to  the  testimony  of  Ms.  Eileen  Shea,  an  authority  on 
risk management in the Pacific. Her report on how the Pacific community has come 
together  to  form  a  family—or  ‘‘ohana’’—in  order  to  pool  resources  for  disaster  pre-
paredness  will  be  most  informative.  I  welcome  her  perspectives  on  how  our  risk 
management  ohana  can  integrate  tsunami  preparedness  into  an  overall  portfolio  of 
planning and preparation.

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Unless  there’s  objection,  we’ll  have  Senators  make  their  state-
ments  after  the  Leader  and  Senator  Landrieu  make  their  state-
ments. 

Welcome. Dr. Frist, we welcome your statement. 

STATEMENT OF HON. BILL FRIST, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER, 

U.S. SENATE 

Senator FRIST. Thank you. 
Mr.  Chairman  and  Senator  Inouye,  Members  of  the  Committee, 
it  is  a  real  honor  for  the  two  of  us  to  present  to  you,  and  to  share 
some of our findings on a trip that we made, very early, to the tsu-
nami  region.  We  had  a  wonderful  opportunity  to  see  the  very  best 
of compassion and caring expressed and, at the same time, witness 
the devastation, destruction, sorrow, and the pain that we all know 
characterized  this  tsunami.  Thanks  for  holding  this  hearing  as  we

look at ways to prevent, as well as to respond to, disasters such as 
the tsunami. This is a very important hearing. 

Senator Landrieu and I, on the spur of the moment, did leave the 
United  States  to  witness  this  destruction,  predominantly  in  Sri 
Lanka. As mentioned, 150,000 people, at least, have died, over five 
million  homes  destroyed,  thousands  remain  missing.  A  real  focus 
on children, will be reflected in both of our comments. 

Many  of  the  nations’  first  responders  came  to  help.  But  I  have 
to say, right up front, it gives us a great deal of pride to watch our 
Marines, very early on, as part of the 12,000 to 15,000 military per-
sonnel  who  responded  quickly  with  usable  forces.  It  was  very  im-
pressive  to  see  them  coming,  moving  debris,  working  with  USAID, 
working in a very cohesive fashion. 

The  destruction  is  exactly  as  described.  I  have  a  slide  up.  It’s  a 
little  bit  shaded,  because  it’s  taken  through  the  window  of  an  air-
plane,  but  the  coast  is  there.  You  can  see,  for  those  several  hun-
dred  meters,  there’s  total  destruction.  What  was  amazing  is,  when 
you  flew  in  a  helicopter,  there’s  no  end  to  it.  It  goes  for  miles—10 
miles, 20 miles, 50 miles, 100 miles, 1,000 miles. 

Much remains to be done. Much has been done already. We have 
psychological  trauma  that  is  going  to  take  years  to  deal  with.  We 
have  shelter  needs  that  will  take  years  to  deal  with.  The  imme-
diate recovery and response, indeed, was quite impressive. 

Amidst  all  the  tragedy,  what  was  clear  to  me  is  that,  in  terms 
of  the  response,  it  was  not  the  absence  of  food,  because  food  was 
provided  fairly  quickly,  and  not  the  absence  of  hospitals,  although 
they were overcrowded, but it was the access to something as basic 
as  water,  that  we  all  take  for  granted.  What  happened  with  the 
tsunami,  the  wells  that  people  had  were  filled  with  saltwater, 
which  is  not  potable  water.  You  had  water  buckets  that  were 
washed  away  totally;  therefore,  people,  however  they  got  their 
water initially, were not able to do that. 

We had a focus on water. I have a slide up right now that shows 
the  aid  that’s  delivered  really  typifies  everybody  coming  together, 
with  USAID  written  on  the  side  of  that  package.  You  see  Sri 
Lankan physicians from the Sri Lankan Red Cross there, aid deliv-
ered  from  around  the  country  in  the  background  there,  the  types 
of quarters in refugee camps, schools that were taken over to house 
many people. 

Quick  action  was  taken;  and,  therefore,  we  didn’t  see  epidemics 
of  malaria  or  pooling  of  water  that  might  have  resulted.  Dredging 
took place. So as water came in and washed in, early dredging pre-
vented  those  pools  of  water  from  which  malaria  could  have  arisen, 
from  which  typhoid  fever  could  have  arisen,  a  breeding  ground  for 
mosquitoes. 

Now  we  need  to  look  at  long-term  solutions,  which  is  part  of 

what this hearing is today. 

One  area  that  I  want  to  focus  on  is  this  area  of  public  health, 
particularly  as  it  does  relate  to  water.  The  conditions  that  we  wit-
nessed  in  the  tsunami’s  aftermath  are  common  conditions  around 
the  world.  There’s  about  1.2  billion  people  who  don’t  have  access 
to potable water today. That will result, probably, in about 135 mil-
lion  deaths  over  the  next  15  to  20  years,  all  because  of  this  lack 
of access to clean water.

Three proposals that I’d like to mention: 
First, clean water should be, ought to be, a major priority in our 
development  programs,  the  U.S.  development  programs.  And 
they’re  not.  Today,  we  spend  about  3  percent  of  our  international 
development  and  humanitarian  assistance  budget  on  water.  That’s 
only  about  $600  million  of  $20  billion.  We  must  work  to  improve 
the  water  quality,  not  only  in  the  areas  that  were  tsunami-dam-
aged,  but,  indeed,  throughout  the  world.  I  mentioned  1.2  billion 
people,  today,  don’t  have  access  to  clean  water;  2.4  billion  people 
don’t have access to basic sanitation. It applies to children, specifi-
cally, because there are 4 billion cases, diarrheal cases a year, and 
that  results  in  1.8  million  deaths  of  children  under  the  age  of  5 
each  and  every  year,  something  that  absolutely  can  be  prevented. 
I  show  this  slide  because  what  is  in  my  hand  are  these  little 
packets  that  we  had  the  opportunity  to  deliver.  This  little  packet, 
which  costs  about  7  cents  to  make,  if  we  had  put  in  any  kind  of 
water, addresses both bacteria and parasites. And this little packet 
costs  7  cents  to  make,  and  will  give  about  45  days  of  clean  water, 
which is pretty amazing. This shows that there are inexpensive so-
lutions  that  we  need  to  be  both  mobilized  up  to  develop,  which  we 
have—this  is  just  1  of  about  4  types  of  packets  like  this—but  also 
to be able to distribute very, very quickly, and that was one of the 
things that Senator Landrieu and I had the opportunity to do. 

No.  2,  we,  I  believe,  need  to  use  medical  assistance  and  public 
health  as  a  currency  for  peace  as  we  engage  others  around  the 
world. We’ve missed it in the past, but I believe medicine and pub-
lic health can be used as a vital tool for international diplomacy as 
we look ahead and decide how to spend our resources. 

The assistance that we give other nations has its greatest impact 
when  it  is  on  the  ground,  when  it  touches  individuals  in  very  inti-
mate and in very personal ways, at the community level. 

I throw this slide in here, because this is a hospital that we vis-
ited, and this is one of the victims from the tsunami who had come 
in.  You  see  the  Sri  Lankan  physicians,  in  the  past  we  met  Scan-
dinavian  physicians,  they  all  make  a  difference,  directly  impacting 
people’s  lives,  with  their  expertise,  but  also  by  reaching  out  and 
touching people in a very intimate way. And we have missed it. We 
don’t  have  any  national  or  international  programs  now  that  focus 
on what I will come back to, and that is a global health corps. 

I  do  intend  to  promote  a  new  version  of  the  type  of  Peace  Corps 
that  we  reach  out  very  directly  as  a  global  health  corps.  It  would 
bring together medical professionals, it would bring together people 
in  this  country  who  want  to  donate  a  period  of  time.  It  might  be 
a month, it might be 6 months, it might be a year, in terms of tech-
nology  and  expertise  in  public  health  and  medicine,  and  it  also 
would  allow  them  to  come  back  to  this  country  and  help  educate 
us  and  the  American  people.  When  you  look  at  the  big,  big  killers 
that  are  out  there  today,  it  is  still  infectious  disease.  It  is  HIV/
AIDS. It is malaria. It is tuberculosis. So it is a win-win for every-
one.  This  global  health  corps,  I’ll  be  talking  more  about  in  the  fu-
ture, but at least wanted to introduce the concept. 

So,  No.  1,  water  should  be  injected  into  our  development  policy 
in  foreign  aid.  And,  No.  2,  let’s  begin  to  think  of  using  medicine 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  13:59 Nov 17, 2005 Jkt 022845 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\22845.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

5

and  public  health  as  a  currency  for  peace,  part  of  our  diplomacy. 
And a good way to start that is a global health corps. 

Third,  and  last,  we  should  leverage  private  dollars  to  develop 
water infrastructure around the world. We’ve done it pretty well in 
the  United  States  of  America,  but  we  have  not  done  it  elsewhere 
around the world. We are the Nation who can do that. Private com-
panies,  not  state  entities,  will  ultimately  do  the  hard  work  of  pro-
viding clean, potable water. 

In  the  tsunami-ravaged  areas,  we  saw  private  businesses,  big 
and  small,  respond  and  assist  in  everything  from  water  purifi-
cation, through packets like this, to logistics. And what we can do, 
and should do, is leverage those private dollars into the field, look-
ing for ways to develop, and ways we can do it, and certain models 
to develop, private/public partnership to inject this capital and help 
people with their water projects. 

In  closing,  I’ll  just  show  this  one  slide.  Again,  this  was  from  our 
trip,  because  it  was  one  of  the  clinics  that  we  visited.  And  there 
are two children there, because, as Senator Landrieu will say, this 
tsunami had a huge impact on children. It reminds me of the med-
ical  response.  These  two  kids  were  sleeping  in  the  same  bed,  be-
cause the infrastructure is not fully developed. And as we reinvest 
in  these  parts  of  the  world,  I  hope  that  we  can  inject  both  water 
infrastructure, as well as public-health infrastructure. 

We  have  much  to  do.  We’ve  got  to  be  bold.  I  think  this  hearing 
is  a  great  start  to  look  both  at  prevention  and  appropriate  re-
sponse. The first steps, indeed, can be quite modest. I do hope that 
my  colleagues  will  support  these  proposals  in  responding  with 
water as a major priority in development assistance; No. 2, a global 
health  corps;  and,  No.  3,  policy  which  will  leverage  private  and 
public  dollars  to  the  benefit  of  kids  like  this  that  are  sitting  with 
me in the hospital. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Landrieu? 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARY L. LANDRIEU,

U.S. SENATOR FROM LOUISIANA 

Senator  LANDRIEU.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  It  is  a  pleasure 
for  me  to  join  Senator  Frist  today  and  give  very  brief  comments, 
because he’s covered so much of what we realized on the trip. 

Let  me  begin  just  by  thanking  you,  acknowledging  a  new  Mem-
ber  of  this  Committee,  Senator  David  Vitter,  who  I’m  sure  will  be 
joining us shortly. His willingness to tackle complex problems will, 
no  doubt,  continue  the  impressive  work  of  Senator  John  Breaux, 
who  served  for  many  years,  and  most  admirably,  on  this  Com-
mittee. 

I want to just ditto, if I could, the points made by Senator Frist, 

but add a few new points, if I could. 

Jokingly, I told him I’d be happy to accompany him on this trip, 
if  he  did  not  require  me  to  go  in  any  operating  room,  which,  I’m 
pleased to report, he lived up to his end of the bargain. 

Senator FRIST. But we got close. 
Senator  LANDRIEU.  Well,  we  got  close,  but  he—I  was  successful 

in staying out of the operating rooms.

But  I  want  to  thank  you  for  your  introduction  of  the  Tsunami 
Warning System bill, which we’re here to testify on today, our need 
to invest in coastal communities, and the immediate and long-term 
impact of this tragedy on children and families. 

First, I would like to say that it’s hard to describe the destruction 
in words. Truly. Not just the intensity of it, but the expanse of the 
coastline  affected.  In  an  instant,  Mr.  Chairman,  thousands  of  peo-
ple  and  structures  on  miles  of  coastline  were  simply  eliminated, 
swallowed up, washed away by a massive surge of water. The only 
warning  that  millions  of  people  had  was  the  ominous  and  awe-in-
spiring  retreat  of  the  ocean’s  waters,  revealing  hundreds  of  feet  of 
sand  and  beach.  Then,  in  a  rush  of  water,  the  magnitude  of  this 
force  wiped  out  3,000  miles  of  shoreline,  and  carried  with  it  the 
homes and lives of hundreds of thousands of people. 

To  give  those  in  our  country  a  better  understanding  of  the  mag-
nitude,  this  chart  would  be  helpful.  I’ve  tried  to  explain  this.  It 
would be as if you took an eraser, started at Galveston, Texas, and 
just erased the coastline all the way up to Bar Harbor, Maine, back 
as  long  as  a  football  field,  in  some  instances,  or  a  fourth  of  a  mile 
to a mile in other instances, eliminated. 

The  most  amazing  thing  that  we  saw  was  actually  the  fact  that 
the palm trees survived. I’ve been through many hurricanes in my 
life,  as  many  of  you  all  have—and,  Mr.  Chairman,  yourself,  you’ve 
witnessed  a  lot  of  the  weather’s  ferociousness  in  Alaska—but  Sen-
ator  Frist  and  I  commented,  as  we  flew  over  this  coastline,  mile 
and mile, that the palm trees managed to just bend with the wave, 
and  after  the  wave  receded,  came  back  up.  But  there  were  no 
homes  or  people  or  structures  underneath  the  palm  trees,  them-
selves. 

It  reminds  me  to  testify,  this  morning,  that  we  should  think  of 
our  coastal  communities  like  palm  trees,  and  build  them  in  a  way 
that  they  can  weather  these  inevitable  natural  disasters,  whether 
they be tsunamis or hurricanes or the surge of saltwater intrusion. 
With  adequate  and  improved  warning,  better  planning,  and  more 
robust  investments  in  the  right  kind  of  infrastructure,  our  coastal 
communities  here  in  America  and  around  the  world  will  continue 
to grow and thrive decade after decade. 

Above  all,  these  astonishing  images.  While  the  death  toll  was 
staggering—it could be over 150,000, 226,000, it’s going to be hard 
to  actually  get  an  accurate  estimate,  of  course;  in  many  of  these 
countries  the  census  is  not  as  sophisticated  as  ours—and  over 
500,000  were  injured.  But  while  the  death  toll  is  staggering,  it  is 
also extremely disturbing to realize that many of these people could 
have  been  saved,  even  with  minimal  time  involved.  People  could 
have  simply  walked  to  safety.  Experts  say  that  oceans  may  give 
people  as  much  as  5-minute  warnings  to  escape  to  higher  ground. 
Five minutes could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Mr. 
Chairman,  even  the  smallest  of  toddlers  and  the  most  frail  of  sen-
iors  can  walk  the  length  of  a  football  field,  out  of  the  reach  of  this 
wave. 

So  I’m  pleased  to  lend  my  support  and  eye-witness  accounts  to 
the Tsunami Preparedness Act. This legislation will improve meth-
ods  of  detecting  and  warning  coastal  residents  about  tsunamis,  es-

tablish  important  mitigation  programs,  enhance  our  research,  and 
assist  our  friends  abroad,  as  Senator  Frist  said,  and  build  peace. 
But warning, Mr. Chairman, is not enough. We must also invest 
and  reinvest  in  our  natural  barriers,  and  constantly  review  our 
evacuation  routes.  This  giant  wave,  not  only  killed  a  quarter  of  a 
million people, it also, as I said, obliterated the natural coastal bar-
riers in the region. The United Nations Environmental Program es-
timates the damage to the environment could topple 675 million in 
loss of natural habitat, an important ecosystem function. This num-
ber could not only—should not only concern environmentalists that 
seek the worthy goal of preserving nature’s wonders, it should also 
concern  those  whose  safety  and  economic  livelihood  depend  on 
these barriers being intact. We know something about that in Lou-
isiana, and so do you in Alaska. Restoring the reefs and barrier is-
lands  and  shorelines  of  these  areas  will  help  long-term  disaster 
risk  reduction.  Without  the  barriers  that  act  as  nature’s  own  line 
of  defense  against  flooding,  storm  surges,  waves,  hurricanes,  and 
even tsunamis, human lives are at risk. 

Mr. Chairman, as I told you, from Louisiana, I know how vulner-
able  coastal  communities  are.  122  million  people  in  America,  53 
percent,  live  in  coastal  counties  or  parishes.  The  most  common 
threat  to  these  communities  is  the  rapid  rise  of  the  water  tables, 
hurricanes, saltwater intrusion. 

I’d  like  to  show  the  next  chart,  briefly,  and  then  end  with  just 

one or two comments. 

In  the  same  area  that  I  showed,  the  areas  in  red  are  basically 
areas in our southern part of the country that are below sea level. 
And I’m sorry I did not have the charts for the Pacific and the At-
lantic  coasts.  But  just  the  Gulf  Coast  region  will  show  you,  in  red, 
it is 1.5 meters below sea level. 

I  ask  this  Committee,  as  we  pass  this  legislation,  what  have  we 
done  if  we  warn  people  of  danger,  but  don’t  help  them  escape  it? 
In  the  hurricanes  that  ravaged  Florida  and  the  Gulf  Coast  region 
last  year,  people  left  their  homes,  only  to  get  stuck  in  gridlock  on 
highways  trying  to  escape  the  150–200  mile-and-hour  winds  that 
were projected along the Gulf Coast. 

So I ask, as you all look forward, not only to this piece of legisla-
tion,  but  in  the  Oceans  Act  or  oceans  legislation  that  is  emerging 
from  the  recent  study,  to  think  carefully  about  that.  While  our 
work here today will focus on warning, we must also focus on what 
this  disaster  means,  or  disasters  like  this  could  mean,  to  our  own 
communities in Louisiana. 

And, finally, one sentence, Mr. Chairman, about the families. Na-
tions  are,  in  fact,  built  on  roads  and  infrastructure  and  railroads. 
But nations are primarily built on families, strong families, united, 
protective  of  one  another,  and  focused  on  building  and  protecting 
their communities. Everything we do, in this Committee or the For-
eign  Ops  Committee  or  in  any  other  Committee  in  this  Congress, 
should be focused on rebuilding these 11 nations, family by family, 
picking the one child that was left, uniting them with the one aunt 
that  was  left,  finding  the  one  grandfather  that  may  still  have  a 
fishing boat intact, and trying to put them together to help rebuild 
these nations, and, in doing so, remind ourselves that building fam-
ilies in America is the best way we can assure our future.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Well, thank you both very much. 
Leader,  last  year  in  the  Foreign  Operations  appropriations  bill, 
we  put  $100  million  in  there  as  an  add-on  to  start  a  program  for 
clean  water  throughout  the  world,  fashioned  after  the  system  that 
we  started  in  Alaska  to  deal  with  the  240-odd  villages  in  Alaska 
that, until recently, did not have clean water and sewer. We figure 
that the cost is about $2,000 a well. As we go into places like Afri-
can  villages,  it’s  much  less  than  what’s  in  our  state.  But  I  do  be-
lieve  we  should  followup  on  your  idea  with  regard  to  try  and  find 
a  way  to  deal  with  this  access-to-clean-water  problem.  And  it’s—I 
don’t  know  how  much  of  it’s  within  the  jurisdiction  of  this  Com-
mittee, but we’re going to take a look and try to work with you on 
that aspect. 

Does  anyone  have  any  comment  or  a  statement  to  make  to  the 

Senators? 

[No response.] 
The CHAIRMAN. We thank you both very much. 
Senator FRIST. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. We look forward to working with you——
Senator LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN.—on this legislation. 
Senator  FRIST.  I  do  appreciate  that  focus  in  appropriations,  just 
real quickly, because I think every Committee needs to go back and 
look, because we’ve had this lack of coordination, and we absolutely 
know  that  that  well,  for  $2,000,  going  back  to  what  Senator 
Landrieu closed on, has an economic impact, has an impact on fam-
ily.  It  is  a  huge  women’s  issue  throughout  Africa.  We  traveled 
throughout  Mozambique,  had  a  large  bipartisan  group,  last  year, 
and, indeed, when you talk to women who are walking 3 to 4 hours 
a  day,  each  day,  for  water,  and  you  look  at  their  children,  you  see 
the  huge  economic,  social,  and  family  impact  that  a  simple  well, 
$2,000, can have on a community. 

So thank you for your leadership there. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. Appreciate you both being

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  JOHN  H.  MARBURGER,  III,  DIRECTOR,
OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY, EXECUTIVE 
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT 
Dr.  MARBURGER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the 
Committee. Thank you for inviting me today to discuss the Admin-
istration’s plans for the U.S. Tsunami Warning System. 

I’ll  keep  my  oral  remarks  short.  Thank  you  for  including  my 

written testimony in the record. 

I, too, have just returned from the tsunami-devastated area. And 
I,  too,  was  sobered  by  the  extent  by  the  extensive  damage  I  saw 
there. 

I  attended  a  ministerial  meeting  on  regional  cooperation  on  tsu-
nami  early  warning  arrangements  in  Phuket,  Thailand.  Science 
ministers  from  approximately  46  countries  were  invited,  including 
all  the  countries  affected  by  the  December  26th  earthquake  and 
tsunami. 

The  greatest  tragedy  of  this  colossal  natural  disaster  is  that 
many  of  the  deaths,  as  Senator  Frist  indicated,  could  have  been 
prevented, if only a warning system had been in place to alert peo-
ple in harm’s way. Preventing deaths in future similar catastrophes 
will  require  a  high  degree  of  international  cooperation,  and  I  will 
mention,  later,  steps  the  Administration  has  taken,  and  plans  to 
take in the future, for securing international cooperation and devel-
oping a global tsunami warning system as part of the Global Earth 
Observation System of Systems, or GEOSS. 

Mr.  Chairman,  about  85  percent  of  tsunamis  worldwide  occur  in 
the  Pacific  Ocean,  where  life-threatening  ones  appear  about  once 
per  decade.  Because  of  this  risk,  the  U.S.  has  led  in  the  develop-
ment of tsunami detection and monitoring technologies, and has co-
operated  since  1968  in  the  International  Coordination  Group  for 
the  Tsunami  Warning  System  in  the  Pacific,  which  currently  has 
26  member  countries.  This  system  operates  under  the  auspices  of 
UNESCO’s  Intergovernmental  Oceanographic  Commission,  or  the 
IOC. 

The  world’s  most  advanced  tsunami-detection  systems,  NOAA’s 
Deep–Ocean  Assessment  and  Reporting  of  Tsunami  buoys—they’re 
called ‘‘DART buoys’’—are deployed as part of the U.S. Pacific Tsu-
nami Warning System. The Administration’s plan includes enhanc-
ing  the  existing  Pacific  Warning  System  to  provide  more  com-
prehensive coverage and faster alerts to broader populations. 

Tsunamis occur less frequently in the Atlantic Ocean, the Carib-
bean, and the Indian Ocean, but, obviously, they are still a threat. 
Their potential impact is increasing because of the global migration 
of  populations  to  coastal  areas.  By  2025,  for  example,  approxi-
mately  75  percent  of  the  U.S.  population  will  live  in  coastal  com-
munities. 

The current risk, measured by the frequency of occurrence times 
the  consequences,  justifies  the  investment  in  expanded  detection 
warning  and  disaster-reduction  systems.  The  Administration’s 
plan,  which  you  will  hear  more  about  in  other  testimony,  will  ex-
pand  our  detection  and  warning  capabilities  to  the  Atlantic  and 
Caribbean,  permitting  very  effective  detection  capability  in  the 
event of a U.S. coastal tsunami.

Of  course,  some  of  the  components  of  a  tsunami  detection  warn-
ing  and  disaster  reduction  system  are  unique  to  the  tsunami  haz-
ard, such as the sensors for deep-ocean detection of tsunami waves, 
but  much  of  such  a  system  has  value  for  other  hazards,  as  well. 
The  communications  infrastructure,  the  emergency  evacuation  and 
response  plans,  damage-assessment  tools,  public  education  pro-
grams,  and  many  other  components  are  relevant,  in  general,  for 
disaster preparedness, mitigation, and response. 

Many  federal  agencies  cooperate  to  provide  technical  support  for 
tsunami  readiness.  Those  represented  here  today:  NOAA,  USGS, 
and  the  National  Science  Foundation  lead  the  effort,  but  agencies 
like  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security,  with  the  Disaster 
Warning  System,  and  NASA’s  Satellite  Remote  Sensing,  also  con-
tribute  to  tsunami  detection  and  warning,  as  well  as  to  post-inci-
dent  damage  assessment  and  response.  Such  interagency  science 
and  technology  activities  are  coordinated  through  the  National 
Science  and  Technology  Council,  managed  by  my  office,  to  ensure 
optimal use of public funds. 

The  U.S.  and  the  international  community  are  well  prepared  to 
create a global tsunami warning system. Catalyzed by the U.S., the 
Intergovernmental Group on Earth Observations——

The  CHAIRMAN.  I’m  constrained  to  tell  you,  we  would  appreciate 

it if you would summarize, that we have another panel. 

Dr.  MARBURGER.  this  is  actually  an  abbreviated  version  of  the 

whole statement. 

Mr. Chairman, I’d like to thank you for this opportunity. I’d just 
indicate  that  we  are  cooperating  with  other  nations  in  an  effective 
organization.  We’re  ready  to  carry  out  the  intent  of  a  bill  that  is 
introduced,  and  Administration  plans  which  are  consistent  with 
that bill. 

[The prepared statement of Dr. Marburger follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. JOHN H. MARBURGER, III, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF 

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY, EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT 

The  recent  tragic  earthquake  and  resulting  tsunami  in  the  Indian  Ocean  was  a 
natural  disaster  of  almost  unimaginable  proportion.  The  U.S.  and  the  world  have 
responded  generously  with  aid  to  those  who  have  been  hurt  and  with  resources  to 
assist in assessing and responding to the damage. What made this event even more 
tragic is that many of the deaths were preventable—if only an effective warning sys-
tem  had  been  in  place  to  alert  the  communities  that  were  in  harm’s  way.  The  Ad-
ministration is committed to helping ensure that warning and response systems are 
put  in  place—domestically  and  internationally—that  will  substantially  reduce  loss 
of life and property in the future. 
The Tsunami Threat 

A  tsunami  is  a  series  of  very  long,  fast-moving  waves  that  can  travel  long  dis-
tances  across  the  open  ocean  at  speeds  up  to  500  mph.  As  the  tsunami  approaches 
shore,  the  successive  waves  may  slow  to  speeds  of  20–30  mph  and  grow  substan-
tially  in  height,  with  the  first  wave  commonly  not  the  largest  or  most  destructive. 
Tsunamis  are  generated  by  any  rapid,  large  scale  sea  disturbance.  Approximately 
90  percent  are  generated  by  undersea  earthquakes,  but  not  all  undersea  earth-
quakes  generate  tsunamis.  They  may  also  be  caused  by  events  such  as  volcanic 
eruptions or major landslides. 

Approximately  85  percent  of  tsunamis  occur  in  the  Pacific  Ocean  because  of  this 
ocean’s encircling major seismic zones that are associated with the volcanoes of the 
‘‘Pacific  Ring  of  Fire.’’  Since  1946,  five  Pacific  Ocean  tsunamis  have  cost  the  U.S. 
more  than  300  lives  and  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  in  property  damage.  Be-
cause of the much greater frequency of Pacific Ocean tsunamis, prior U.S. and glob-
al  efforts  to  develop  tsunami  warning  systems  have  focused  on  this  region.  Since

1968, the U.S. and other Pacific region nations have cooperated in the International 
Coordination  Group  for  the  Tsunami  Warning  System  in  the  Pacific  (ICG/ITSU), 
which  currently  has  26  member  states.  This  system  operates  under  the  auspices  of 
UNESCO’s  Intergovernmental  Oceanographic  Commission  (IOC).  Currently,  the 
world’s most advanced tsunami detection systems, NOAA’s Deep Ocean Assessment 
and  Reporting  of  Tsunami  (DART)  systems,  are  deployed  in  the  U.S.  Pacific  Tsu-
nami Warning System. 

Although less likely, tsunamis have some potential of occurring in the rest of the 
world’s  oceans,  including  the  Indian  Ocean,  Caribbean,  and  Atlantic  Ocean.  Even 
though  the  probability  is  small,  the  potential  for  tsunami-related  loss  of  life  and 
property is increasing because of population migrations to coastal areas. The United 
Nations  reports  that  already  two-thirds  of  the  world’s  population  crowd  near  the 
coastline, and within three decades, if trends continue, 75 percent of humanity will 
reside  in  coastal  areas.  By  2025  nearly  75  percent  of  all  Americans  are  expected  to 
live  in  coastal  counties,  many  of  whom  will  be  in  tsunami  risk  areas.  Given  a 
tsunami’s  great  destructive  power,  expanding  tsunami  protection  for  U.S.  coastal 
communities  and  developing  global  early  detection  and  warning  systems  are  justi-
fied. 

While plans to expand the world’s tsunami detection and warning capabilities for 
global coverage were already in development when the December 26 tsunami struck, 
this event has focused international attention on the need for tsunami detection and 
warning and has created opportunities for enhanced international cooperation in de-
veloping and deploying such systems. 
Disaster Warning and Reduction Systems 

Some  of  the  components  of  a  tsunami  detection,  warning  and  disaster  reduction 
system are unique to the tsunami hazard, such as the sensors for deep ocean detec-
tion  of  tsunami  waves.  But,  I  would  like  to  emphasize  that  a  great  deal  of  the  in-
vestment  is  not  confined  to  tsunamis  alone.  The  communications  infrastructure, 
emergency  evacuation  and  response  plans,  damage  assessment  tools,  public  edu-
cation programs, and other components are relevant to many types of disasters. 

I would like to outline the generic components for a successful disaster detection, 
warning,  and  reduction  system,  including  how  these  components  relate  specifically 
to the tsunami hazard. A complete system includes:

false alarms and the associated erosion of public confidence;

• Risk assessment, which is enabled by the detailed modeling of coastline commu-
nities  and  by  increased  scientific  understanding  of  the  formation  and  propaga-
tion of tsunamis;
• Detection,  to  reliably  indicate  whether  a  tsunami  has  occurred,  avoiding  costly 
• Warning,  including  the  initial  issuance;  transmission  to  affected  countries,  re-
gions, and communities; and communication to the affected population;
• Activation of a response plan, already in place in the local communities;
• A ‘‘ready public,’’ able to respond in an efficient and timely manner through pre-
• Situational  awareness,  with  monitoring  of  the  incident  until  an  ‘‘all  clear’’  has 
• Resilient  infrastructure,  protective  shelters,  reliable  supply  routes,  food  and 
• Lessons  learned;  a  post-incident  evaluation  with  feedback  to  enable  future  im-

water, medical supplies and medical evacuation procedures; and ultimately

paredness education;

been sounded;

provements.

Science and Technology for Tsunami Readiness 

Mobilizing  federal  science  and  technology  to  support  tsunami  readiness  requires 
the contributions from a number of federal agencies, and also requires a coordinated 
approach.  The  agencies  represented  here  today,  NOAA,  USGS,  and  NSF,  lead  our 
tsunami  readiness  effort,  but  the  contributions  of  other  agencies,  such  as  the  De-
partment  of  Homeland  Security  in  disaster  warning  systems  and  NASA  in  satellite 
remote  sensing,  contribute  in  a  variety  of  ways  to  tsunami  detection  and  warning, 
as  well  as  to  post-incident  damage  assessment  and  response.  Federal  science  and 
technology  challenges  that  draw  on  the  strengths  of  more  than  one  agency  are  co-
ordinated  through  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council  (NSTC).  In  par-
ticular,  coordination  through  the  Subcommittee  on  Disaster  Reduction  and  the 
Interagency Working Group on Earth Observations has been critical in assuring the 
best use of our collective capabilities. 

Although  we  are  focused  here  today  on  what  it  will  take  to  deploy  a  system  that 
will allow faster and more accurate tsunami detection and warning, I would like to

point  out  some  of  our  other  significant  contributions  to  tsunami  warning  and  dis-
aster reduction:

to improve emergency response planning.

• Our ability to do accurate risk assessment and prediction is supported by basic 
research on seismic and tsunami processes as well as by advances in numerical 
modeling and simulations of these processes and of their impact on coastal com-
munities.
• Enhanced  community  warning  systems  and  improved  disaster  response  capa-
bilities are being developed by FEMA and other agencies, capitalizing on an ‘‘all 
hazards’’ approach to disaster-resilience.
• Research  findings  from  the  social  and  behavioral  sciences  are  being  employed 
• Advanced  satellite  communications  technologies  and  data  relay  allow  real-time 
monitoring  of  the  situation,  and  satellite  remote  sensing  images  and  products 
are being used by relief agencies to assess the extent of the damage and deter-
mine where relief efforts are most critical and how best to carry them out. Sat-
ellite  images  from  the  December  26  tsunami  also  provided  the  first  large-scale, 
open ocean data of a major tsunami event.
• And,  tsunami  education  programs  are  being  developed  and  used  with  at-risk 
populations, such as NOAA’s National Weather Service TsunamiReady Program 
that  provides  public  education  and  preparedness  measures  for  vulnerable  U.S. 
coastal communities.

Tsunami  detection  begins  with  seismic  monitoring.  The  Global  Seismographic 
Network,  which  is  managed  jointly  by  the  USGS  and  NSF  with  international  part-
ners,  currently  has  a  network  of  137  seismic  stations  that  have  been  installed 
around  the  world  in  a  variety  of  configurations.  The  seismographs  detect  earth-
quakes  and,  judging  from  the  location,  type  and  magnitude  of  the  earthquake,  can 
indicate the possible generation of a tsunami. In many areas of the globe, the pres-
ence of a tsunami can only be confirmed as the tsunami nears shore and is detected 
by tidal gauges. However, in the Pacific Ocean NOAA has deployed six Deep Ocean 
Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami (DART) systems consisting of a seafloor pres-
sure  sensor  that  can  detect  a  tsunami  as  it  passes  and  relay  the  information  to  a 
moored  surface  buoy  for  communication  via  satellite  to  Tsunami  Warning  Centers. 
DART  systems  provide  earlier  and  more  accurate  tsunami  detection  and  signifi-
cantly reduce costly false alarms. 

U.S. plans for improved initial tsunami detection and warning hinge on deploying 
more  DART  systems  to  cover  at-risk  areas  of  the  world’s  oceans,  and  on  improving 
the  Global  Seismographic  Network  to  provide  enhanced  coverage  as  well  as  im-
proved analysis and communications of earthquake activity. Additional research into 
seismic  and  tsunami  processes,  and  public  education  and  preparedness  programs, 
are  also  essential.  The  Administration  has  outlined  detailed  plans  for  an  enhanced 
U.S.  system  that  will  provide  nearly  100  percent  detection  capability  for  the  U.S. 
coasts,  and  we  have  proposed  to  commit  $37.5  million  over  the  next  two  years  to 
build  and  deploy  this  system.  You  will  hear  the  details  of  this  proposal  from  the 
other members of this panel. 
International Coordination for Tsunami Readiness 

Tsunamis and many other naturally occurring phenomena are global in scale and 
require  international  cooperation  in  response.  The  Administration  is  committed  to 
working  with  our  international  partners  on  the  process  of  developing  a  global  tsu-
nami detection, warning and response capability. 

In the aftermath of December 26, a number of countries have called for expanded 
tsunami  warning  systems  both  in  the  Indian  Ocean  and  globally.  Australia,  Ger-
many, Japan, India, China and other countries quickly announced proposals for es-
tablishing  early  warning  systems  for  tsunamis  or,  in  the  case  of  China,  for  all  nat-
ural  disasters.  A  number  of  countries  and  organizations  have  also  proposed  special 
international  meetings  on  these  topics.  We  are  endorsing  and  promoting  coordina-
tion of efforts among likely key contributors as well as incorporation of these efforts 
into  existing  mechanisms  for  global  cooperation  on  disaster  warning  and  reduction. 
We propose that coordination be carried out through the Intergovernmental Group 
on  Earth  Observations  (GEO).  Enhanced  Earth  observation  was  a  core  element  of 
the  2003  G–8  Evian  Action  Plan  on  Science  and  Technology  for  Sustainable  Devel-
opment.  The  World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  in  Johannesburg  in  2002 
also  called  for  greater  integration  of  Earth  observation  systems.  Responding  to  this 
priority, the U.S. hosted the first Earth Observation Summit in Washington, DC in 
July 2003. As a result of this meeting, the GEO was established to organize the de-
velopment of a comprehensive, coordinated, and sustained Global Earth Observation

System of Systems (GEOSS). 56 countries are currently GEOSS partners, including 
India, Indonesia and Thailand. All nations are invited and encouraged to join. GEO 
has developed a ten-year plan that is focused on nine societal benefits, including ‘‘re-
duce  loss  of  life  and  property  from  disasters’’  and  ‘‘protect  and  monitor  our  ocean 
resources.’’  Once  implemented,  this  plan  could  not  only  revolutionize  our  under-
standing of the Earth and how it works, but how countries cooperate. 

It  is  important  to  note  that  UNESCO’s  Intergovernmental  Ocean  Commission 
(IOC)  is  a  GEO  member  and  the  coordinating  body  of  the  existing  Tsunami  Early 
Warning System in the Pacific. Efforts to establish a tsunami early warning system 
in  the  Indian  Ocean  can  benefit  from  the  experience  and  expertise  of  the  IOC,  not 
only  in  coordinating  the  Pacific  Early  Warning  System,  but  also  in  addressing  the 
full range of ocean and coastal problems through the sharing of knowledge, informa-
tion and technology among countries. 

At  the  World  Conference  on  Disaster  Reduction,  January  18–22,  in  Kobe  Japan, 
the  U.S.  delegation  affirmed  U.S.  commitment  to  working  with  our  international 
partners  on  a  global  tsunami  warning  system.  I  have  just  returned  from  the  Min-
isterial Meeting on Regional Cooperation on Tsunami Early Warning Arrangements 
in  Phuket,  Thailand,  at  which  we  considered  a  Thai  proposal  for  developing  a  re-
gional tsunami early warning system for the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia. The 
U.S.  has  proposed  that  the  development  of  any  regional  or  global  tsunami  warning 
system—particularly  in  the  Indian  Ocean—be  coordinated  through  GEO  and  be  a 
top,  near-term  priority  for  GEOSS.  This  discussion  will  continue  when  the  Group 
meets  in  Brussels,  February  14–16  and  formally  adopts  the  GEOSS  10-year  imple-
mentation  plan.  After  the  implementation  plan  is  ratified  by  the  GEOSS  partners 
in February, specific country commitments and steps forward will be important top-
ics for the G–8 summit in July 2005. 

As  part  of  the  strategic  planning  for  this  international  ‘‘system  of  systems,’’  the 
U.S. has developed its own Strategic Plan for the U.S. Integrated Earth Observation 
System which, like the international plan, focuses on the nine societal benefit areas. 
This  strategic  plan  was  developed  by  the  NSTC  Interagency  Working  Group  on 
Earth Observations, and provides the essential framework for the U.S. contribution 
to  the  GEOSS  implementation  plan.  The  expansion  of  the  U.S.  tsunami  warning 
system will be implemented in the context of this U.S. Integrated Earth Observation 
System and as a U.S. contribution to GEOSS. 

I  should  also  mention  that  Admiral  Lautenbacher  is  the  U.S.  Co-Chair  of  GEO, 
along with Japan, the European Commission, and South Africa, and that Dr. Groat 
is  the  U.S.  representative  to  GEO.  They  will  also  speak  in  more  detail  about  the 
development  of  GEOSS  and  the  U.S.  contributions  to  this  important  international 
project. 
Conclusion 

In  closing,  I  would  like  to  quote  David  Broder  of  the  Washington  Post  on  this 
topic:  ‘‘Just  as  the  world  has  managed  to  put  aside  political,  religious,  and  ethnic 
rivalries to help the victims of this disaster, so the scientists and environmentalists 
meeting in Brussels will have an opportunity to show their foresight in making such 
calamities  less  likely.  The  United  States  leadership  in  this  international  effort  is  a 
source of pride for the nation.’’

The  CHAIRMAN.  We  thank  you  very  much.  I  apologize  for  the 

interruption. 

General Kelly, we’re pleased to have your statement. 
Before  your  statement,  I  would  place  in  the  record  the  letter  we 
received  from  the  General  Counsel  of  your  Department  which  ad-
vises us that the Administration does support this bill.

Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, 
Washington, DC.

FEBRUARY 1, 2005

Dear Mr. Chairman:
This  letter  provides  you  with  the  Department  of  Commerce’s  views  on  S.  50,  the 
‘‘Tsunami  Preparedness  Act’’.  The  recent  catastrophic  event  in  the  Indian  Ocean 
highlights  the  threat  tsunamis  pose  to  many  coastal  communities,  and  the  need  to 
defend  American  communities  against  future  tsunamis.  The  Department  supports

the Committee’s efforts to strengthen the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin-
istration’s  (NOAA)  tsunami  detection,  forecast,  warning,  mitigation  and  education 
and outreach programs. In light of this event, as well as this past hurricane season, 
the  Department  believes  that  we  should  take  this  opportunity  to  strengthen  and 
clarify NOAA’s responsibilities for protecting lives and property from the broad spec-
trum  of  natural  hazards  the  nation  faces.  We  would  like  to  work  with  the  Com-
mittee this year to pass the Administration’s NOAA Organic Act, which provides the 
necessary authorities and flexibility for NOAA to effectively and efficiently carry out 
its mission, including tsunami warnings. 

While  the  Department  supports  the  Committee’s  legislative  intent  to  address 
tsunamis  through  the  authorization  process,  we  are  concerned  that  the  specificity 
in the proposed bill could unintentionally limit NOAA’s ability to effectively manage 
these  programs.  Our  major  concerns  are  with  sections  3(b),  which  could  restrict 
NOAA’s  ability  to  apply  new  technologies  and  techniques,  and  3(d)(4),  3(e),  4(c)(6), 
6(a)(1), 6(b) and 7(c), which seek to restrict the authority of NOAA and the Adminis-
trator, and which would impair NOAA’s ability to manage its own resources and pri-
orities.  Further,  we  are  concerned  that  S.  50  does  not  vest  authorities  in  the  Sec-
retary  of  Commerce,  who  is  responsible  for  all  Department  of  Commerce  programs. 
Finally,  the  Department  requests  that  all  funding  authorized  for  this  purpose  be 
consistent  with  the  amounts  contained  in  the  Administration’s  proposal  for 
strengthening  the  U.S.  Tsunami  Warning  System,  which  was  released  on  January 
14,  2005.  The  Department  of  Commerce  appreciates  the  opportunity  to  present 
views on S. 50 and looks forward to working with you to ensure NOAA has the nec-
essary  authorities  to  respond  effectively  to  all  natural  hazards,  including  tsunamis. 
The  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  has  advised  that  there  is  no  objection  to 
the transmittal of these views from the standpoint of the Administration’s program. 

Sincerely, 

JANE T. DANA, 

Acting General Counsel

STATEMENT OF BRIGADIER GENERAL JOHN J. KELLY, U.S. AIR 
FORCE 
(RETIRED),  DEPUTY  UNDER  SECRETARY  OF
COMMERCE  FOR  OCEANS  AND  ATMOSPHERE,  NATIONAL 
OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA) 
General KELLY. Mr. Chairman, thank you for those kind remarks 
about  my  boss.  I’ll  pass  them  to  him,  and  hopefully  that  will  help 
speed  his  recovery.  I  know  he  really  wanted  to  be  here  today  to 
talk about this subject, because he keenly cares about it. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  he  is  a  great  friend,  and  we  visited  with 
him when he visited the Hawaii Tsunami Center, just recently. So 
we do send our best wishes. 

General  KELLY.  Chairman  Stevens,  Senator  Inouye,  Members  of 
the  Committee,  I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  about 
NOAA’s  activities  with  tsunamis,  and  I  appreciate  you  submitting 
my written remarks and including them in the record. 

What  I’ll  briefly  focus  on  this  morning  is  the  U.S.  Tsunami 
Warning Program, how the U.S. can help the world better prepare 
for  tsunamis,  and  NOAA’s  role  in  the  Tsunami  Warning  Program. 
NOAA and its predecessor agencies have provided tsunami warn-
ing  services  to  this  nation  since  1949.  In  1996,  as  you  mentioned, 
the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program was established, 
and it is a NOAA-led effort, to forge partnerships with federal and 
state  entities  to  detect  and,  most  importantly,  prepare  for,  and  re-
spond to, tsunamis. 

Your continued support for that program has helped prepare this 
nation  for  the  next  tsunami  in  three  ways.  One,  creation  of  tsu-
nami  flooding  and  inundation  maps;  the  use  of  these  maps  to  es-
tablish  TsunamiReady  committees;  and  improvements  in  tsunami 
warning services through research, better use of seismic and deep-

ocean  tsunami  data,  and  the  development  of  forecast  models. 
NOAA  is  proud  of  the  collective  accomplishments  that  both  we,  on 
the  federal  side,  and  with  our  partners  in  the  states  have  accom-
plished,  and  believe  your  investments  and  NOAA’s  efforts  have  al-
ready  paid  big  dividends.  Yet  the  tragedy  in  the  Indian  Ocean 
shows  that  we  need  to  do  more  to  accelerate  and  expand  our  tsu-
nami preparedness in this country. 

The  current  Tsunami  Warning  System  consists  of  two  warning 
centers,  the  Richard  H.  Hagemayer  Center,  in  Hawaii,  and  the 
West  Coast  Alaska  Tsunami  Warning  Center,  in  Palmer,  Alaska. 
These  centers  are  responsible  for  issuing  all  tsunami  warning/
watch advisory and information messages. 

As  Dr.  Marburger  mentioned,  NOAA  research  activities  devel-
oped  the  Deep–Ocean  Assessment  and  Reporting  of  Tsunamis,  or 
DART, buoys to measure tsunamis in the deep ocean, and to trans-
mit  this  information  back  to  the  warning  centers.  These  instru-
ments  accurately  characterize  the  size  of  a  tsunami  by  measuring 
the pressure wave from the deep-ocean floor as it passes. Tsunamis 
as small as half a centimeter have been measured. 

In November of 2003, the DART buoys demonstrated their effec-
tiveness.  A  large  earthquake  occurred  in  the  Aleutian  Islands  and 
generated  a  tsunami.  The  two  warning  centers  evaluated  the  tsu-
nami,  based  on  data  from  the  DART  buoy,  and  confirmed  only  a 
small  wave.  This  accurate  prediction  of  the  non-destructive  tsu-
nami is estimated to save the government of Hawaii about $68 mil-
lion  in  preparation  costs.  We  also  have  about  100  water  gauges 
used by the Tsunami Warning Center to provide information on the 
magnitude of the tsunami. 

The  NOAA  Hagemayer  Warning  Center  also  serves  as  the  oper-
ational center for the International Tsunami Warning Center of the 
Pacific,  which  is  comprised  of  26  nations.  The  center’s  primary  re-
sponsibility  is  to  issue  tsunami  warnings  in  the  Pacific  Basin  for 
tsunamis that may cause damage far away from their source; how-
ever,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  member  nation  to  issue  local 
warnings. 

On  Sunday  the  26th  of  December,  within  7  minutes  of  notifica-
tion,  and  within  15  minutes  of  the  Indonesian  earthquake,  both 
centers issued tsunami information bulletins. However, an effective 
tsunami  warning  system  requires  many  components:  one,  an  as-
sessment  of  the  hazard;  two,  near-realtime  data;  three,  highspeed 
data-analysis capabilities; four, a highspeed tsunami warning com-
munications system; and, last, but probably most important, an ef-
fective local communications infrastructure for the timely and effec-
tive dissemination of warning and evacuation requirements. Unfor-
tunately, such a system does not exist in the Indian Ocean. 

With  global  attention  on  this  important  matter,  we  have  a  great 
opportunity  to  better  prepare  the  world  for  tsunamis  through  the 
development  of  a  Global  Earth  Observation  System  of  Systems. 
The United States has been leading this effort for the past 2 years. 
Next  month,  in  Brussels,  54  nations  of  the  world,  and  the  Euro-
pean  Union,  will  gather  together  to  reach  an  agreement  that  will 
begin the development of GEOSS. 

Vice  Admiral  Lautenbacher  is  the  co-chair  of  that  effort,  and  we 
are going to work to ensure that the GEOSS’s first order of priority

is  to  develop  a  global  tsunami  warning  system.  It  is  my  hope  that 
positive  changes  in  technology,  education,  and  cooperation  will 
emerge from what happened in the Indian Ocean. 

The  Bush  Administration  recently  announced  that  we  are  com-
mitted to completing the current U.S. Tsunami Warning System by 
mid-2007.  NOAA’s  contribution  to  that  system  includes  modern-
izing and expanding the existing DART buoy network. We plan on 
installing  32  new  operational  DART  buoys—25  in  the  Pacific,  7  in 
the Atlantic and the Caribbean. And, as you well know, Mr. Chair-
man,  the  weather  in  the  Aleutians  is  a  real  challenge,  and  it  com-
plicates  our  ability  to  repair  the  DART  buoys  when  they  malfunc-
tion;  and  so,  we  are  going  to  place,  in  the  Aleutian  area,  in  the 
water,  three  backup  buoys,  so  if  a  primary  one  goes  down,  we’ll 
automatically have an ability to continue to get that data. 

We will also procure and install 38 new sea-level monitoring and 
tide  gauge  stations,  and  expand  the  operation  of  the  Alaska  and 
Hawaii  Tsunami  Warning  Centers  to  24  hours  a  day,  7  days  a 
week.  NOAA  forecasters  will  then  be  better  able  to  protect  the 
United  States,  and  will  be  able  to  alert  communities  within  min-
utes of a tsunami-producing effect. 

As  you  mentioned,  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Department  of  Commerce 
does  support  Senate  Bill  50,  the  Tsunami  Preparedness  Act,  and 
you do have the letter of support from the Department. 

In  closing,  I  appreciate  your  efforts  to  help  better  prepare  this 
country for the next tsunami, because it’s not a question of if there 
will be one, it is when it will be and where it will be. 

Thank you. 
[The  prepared  statement  of  Vice  Admiral  Lautenbacher  follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF VICE ADMIRAL CONRAD LAUTENBACHER,  JR.,  U.S.  NAVY 
(RETIRED),  UNDERSECRETARY OF COMMERCE FOR OCEANS AND ATMOSPHERE;
ADMINISTRATOR, NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, for the opportunity to 
testify before you regarding the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations 
(NOAA) activities with tsunamis. I am Vice Admiral (retired) Conrad Lautenbacher, 
Jr.,  Undersecretary  of  Commerce  for  Oceans  and  Atmosphere  and  NOAA  Adminis-
trator. 

As  the  world  and  our  Nation  mourn  the  loss  of  life  from  the  Indian  Ocean  tsu-
nami tragedy, we recognize the very real threat of tsunamis and ask, ‘‘Could it hap-
pen  here? ’’  We  need  to  be  able  to  answer  that  question  with  a  high  degree  of  con-
fidence. 

We  know  a  tsunami  can  affect  any  community  along  the  coast  of  the  United 
States.  This  is  particularly  true  for  the  Pacific  coast,  where  tsunamis  have  been 
more  frequent.  The  recent  event  in  Southeast  Asia  and  Africa  highlights  the  need 
to identify steps we can take to mitigate the potential impact of such an event here 
at home. 

NOAA  and  its  predecessor  agencies  have  provided  tsunami  warning  services  for 
our Nation since 1949. Following the 1992 Northern California earthquake/tsunami, 
Congress  asked  NOAA  to  examine  tsunami  preparedness  of  the  U.S.  West  Coast 
and  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program  (NTHMP)  was  born.  The 
NTHMP  is  a  NOAA  led  effort  to  forge  federal/state  partnerships  to  detect,  prepare 
and respond to tsunamis. Your continued support for this program has prepared our 
country for the next U.S. tsunami in three main ways: (1) Creation of tsunami flood-
ing/inundation maps using advanced numerical models; (2) Use of these maps to de-
velop  evacuation  procedures,  road  signs  to  guide  evacuation,  educational  programs 
to  raise  tsunami  awareness,  and  the  establishment  of  TsunamiReady  communities; 
and (3) Improvements in tsunami warning services through the use of better seismic 
and  deep  ocean  tsunami  data  and  the  development  of  tsunami  forecast  models. 
NOAA  is  proud  of  the  collective  accomplishments  of  federal  partners  (USGS,  NSF, 
and  FEMA)  along  with  our  state  partners  (Alaska,  California,  Hawaii,  Oregon,  and

Washington).  Over  the  past  8  years  we  have  identified  what  needs  to  be  done,  but 
so far there are inundation maps for only 30 percent of the Pacific states coastline, 
local  communities  are  in  need  of  warning  dissemination  systems,  and  the  NOAA 
tsunami warning system needs more deep ocean tsunami detectors to improve warn-
ing  services.  Your  investments  and  NOAA’s  efforts  to  date  have  paid  large  divi-
dends, yet, in the face of the Sumatra tsunami, we believe our Nation should accel-
erate and expand our tsunami preparedness efforts. 

In this testimony, I will describe our existing tsunami warning program, including 
a  brief  overview  of  our  work  with  the  International  community;  specific  actions 
NOAA took during the recent tsunami; and then briefly outline the Administration’s 
plan for developing a global tsunami warning system. 

Tsunamis are natural disasters that can form in all of the world’s oceans and in-
land  seas,  and  in  any  large  body  of  water  near  seismic  activity.  Each  region  of  the 
world  appears  to  have  its  own  cycle  of  frequency  and  pattern  for  generating 
tsunamis  that  range  in  size  from  small  events  (no  hazards)  to  the  large  and  highly 
destructive  events.  Eighty-five  percent  of  tsunamis  occur  in  the  Pacific  Ocean  and 
its marginal seas. This is not surprising as the Pacific Basin covers more than one-
third of the earth’s surface and is surrounded by a series of mountain chains, deep-
ocean trenches and island arcs called the ‘‘ring of fire.’’

Most  seismic  activity  occurs  in  this  ring  of  fire  where  the  main  tectonic  plates 
forming the floor of the Pacific collide against one another or against the continental 
plates that surround the ocean basin, forming subduction zones. While tsunamis can 
be  generated  by  any  sudden  pressure  source  in  the  water,  such  as  a  meteor,  land-
slide,  etc.,  most  are  generated  from  earthquakes.  Large  earthquakes  can  create 
tsunamis that may be locally devastating, their energy decays rapidly with distance. 
Usually  they  are  not  destructive  more  than  a  few  hundred  kilometers  away  from 
their  sources.  That  is  not  the  case  with  tsunamis  generated  by  great  earthquakes 
in  the  North  Pacific  or  along  the  Pacific  coast  of  South  America.  On  the  average 
of six times per century, a tsunami caused by an earthquake in one of these regions 
sweeps across the entire Pacific Ocean, is reflected from distant shores, and sets the 
entire  ocean  in  motion  for  days.  Although  not  as  frequent,  destructive  tsunamis 
have also been generated in the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans, the Mediterranean 
Sea  and  even  within  smaller  bodies  of  water,  such  as  the  Sea  of  Marmara,  in  Tur-
key.  There  have  also  been  tsunamis  in  the  Caribbean,  but  the  lack  of  any  recent 
tsunami  in  that  area  has  lowered  the  level  of  interest  and  hindered  establishing  a 
warning program in that area. 

at least 10 caused widespread destruction throughout the Pacific.

• 923 tsunamis were observed or recorded in the Pacific Ocean.
• 120  tsunamis  caused  casualties  and  damage,  most  near  the  source.  Of  these, 
• The  greatest  number  of  tsunamis  during  any  one  year  was  23  in  1938.  While 
• There was no single year during this period that was free of tsunamis.
• 19 percent of all tsunamis were generated in or near Japan; 9 percent were gen-
erated  off  Alaska  and  the  west  coasts  of  Canada  and  the  United  States;  and  3 
percent were generated near Hawaii.

most were minor, one event did result in 17 deaths.

According  to  NOAA’s  National  historical  tsunami  databases,  during  the  105-year 

period from 1900 to 2004:

The  U.S.  Tsunami  Warning  System  consists  of  two  warning  centers:  the  Richard 
H. Hagemeyer Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) in Ewa Beach, Hawaii; and 
the  West  Coast/Alaska  Tsunami  Warning  Center  (WC/ATWC)  in  Palmer,  Alaska. 
NOAA  conducts  research  on  tsunamis,  operates  essential  ocean  buoys  and  tide 
gauges  to  detect  tsunamis,  and  works  with  other  federal,  state,  local  government 
agencies and universities as our partners in the tsunami warning mission. 

The Richard H. Hagemeyer Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii was estab-
lished  in  1949  in  response  to  the  unpredicted  1946  Aleutian  tsunami,  which  killed 
165  people  on  the  Hawaiian  Islands.  In  1967,  the  West  Coast/Alaska  Tsunami 
Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, was created as a result of the 1964 Great Alas-
ka  earthquake  and  tsunami.  These  centers  are  responsible  for  issuing  all  tsunami 
warning, watch, advisory, and information messages to emergency management offi-
cials  and  the  public  throughout  their  respective  areas  of  responsibility.  The  Pacific 
Center covers United States interests and territories throughout the Pacific, includ-
ing  Hawaii,  while  the  West  Coast/Alaska  Center  covers  Alaska,  and  the  west  coast 
of North America from British Columbia, Canada through California. 

About 100 water level gauges are used by the Tsunami Warning Centers and are 
operated  by  the  United  States  and  our  international  partners.  These  gauges  are 
along  the  coasts  of  islands  or  continents  around  the  Pacific  Rim.  NOAA  operates

many  of  these  stations,  including  33  from  NOAA’s  National  Water  Level  Observa-
tion  Network  in  the  Pacific  Ocean  basin,  which  are  equipped  with  software  to  sup-
port  the  Tsunami  Warning  System.  Water  levels  from  these  gauges  can  be  sent  di-
rectly  to  NOAA  Tsunami  Warning  Centers  and  others  who  want  the  information. 
NOAA is working to upgrade the nationwide network with a real-time capability to 
provide  a  continuous  (minute-by-minute)  stream  of  water  level  data  for  integration 
with tsunami warning systems and research applications. NOAA also helps support 
many coastal gauges located in other countries around the Pacific. 

NOAA  operates  six  Deep-ocean  Assessment  and  Reporting  of  Tsunamis  (DART) 
buoys. NOAA research activities developed these buoys to measure tsunamis in the 
deep  ocean  and  to  transmit  the  information  back  to  the  Warning  Centers  in  near 
real  time.  These  instruments  accurately  calculate  the  size  of  the  tsunami  by  meas-
uring  the  pressure  it  exerts  on  the  deep  ocean  floor  as  the  wave  passes  over. 
Tsunamis  as  small  as  0.5  cm  have  been  measured.  NOAA  began  placing  DART 
buoys in the Pacific Ocean in 2002 and plans to have a complete coverage of poten-
tial Pacific tsunami source zones over the next few years. 

In  November  2003,  the  buoys  demonstrated  their  effectiveness.  A  large  earth-
quake occurred in the Aleutian Islands and generated a tsunami. The two Tsunami 
Warning Centers evaluated the tsunami using coastal gauge data but did not ‘‘stand 
down’’ until a reading arrived from the nearest DART buoy confirming only a small 
tsunami. During post analysis of the event, DART data were used for a model sim-
ulation  and  the  output  from  the  simulation  accurately  predicted  the  2  cm  tsunami 
recorded  at  Hilo,  Hawaii.  This  NOAA  model  is  still  being  developed,  but  an  initial 
version  will  be  transferred  to  the  warning  centers  for  test  operations  this  year. 
DART  data  and  the  forecast  model  show  much  promise  to  help  accurately  predict 
tsunami  impacts.  In  the  history  of  the  Pacific  Warning  Center,  75  percent  of  its 
warnings  to  Hawaii  have  been  for  non-destructive  tsunamis.  The  DART  data  com-
bined with forecast models promise to significantly reduce false alarm rates as well 
as  provide  a  better  measure  of  the  severity  of  destructive  tsunamis  for  Hawaii  and 
all other parts of the Pacific. The accurate forecasting of a non-destructive tsunami 
in  November  2003  saved  Hawaii  an  estimated  $68M  in  projected  evacuation  costs. 
The Pacific Center also serves as the operational center for the International Tsu-
nami  Warning  System  of  the  Pacific,  which  is  comprised  of  26  member  nations  of 
the Pacific Rim. These members share seismic and water level information with the 
Pacific Center so the Center can determine whether a tsunami was generated in the 
Pacific  Basin  and  assess  its  strength.  The  Pacific  Center’s  primary  responsibility  is 
to issue tsunami warnings for Pacific Basin teletsunamis—tsunamis that can cause 
damage far away from their source. It is not the Center’s responsibility to issue local 
tsunami  warnings  from  seismic  events  outside  of  the  United  States.  For  example, 
if  an  earthquake  occurs  off  the  coast  of  Japan  and  a  local  tsunami  is  generated,  it 
is Japan’s responsibility to issue a local tsunami warning. However, it is the Pacific 
Center’s  responsibility  to  warn  all  participating  Nations  in  the  Pacific  Basin  if  the 
Japanese tsunami will cause damage far from its source. 

Only  Australia  and  Indonesia  have  coastlines  bordering  both  the  Pacific  and  In-
dian  Ocean  coasts.  None  of  the  other  countries  impacted  by  the  Indian  Ocean  tsu-
nami have coasts bordering the Pacific Ocean and therefore they do not receive tsu-
nami bulletins via the automated dissemination network. 

Thailand  and  Indonesia  are  member  states  within  the  International  Tsunami 
Warning  System  in  the  Pacific  (ITSU),  but  their  participation  has  been  limited. 
Thailand has no coast along the Pacific, and Indonesia’s tsunami threat is primarily 
outside  the  Pacific  Basin.  As  a  member  of  the  International  Coordination  Group 
(ICG)  for  ITSU,  the  U.S.  has  actively  encouraged  non-member  States  to  become 
ICG/ITSU members. Under the IGC/ITSU, the U.S. has actively supported the need 
for  global  tsunami  mitigation  actions  and  will  continue  to  provide  support  through 
the development of a Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), an ef-
fort  in  which  the  UNESCO  Intergovernmental  Oceanographic  Commission,  the  UN 
International  Strategy  for  Disaster  Reduction  (ISDR),  and  a  number  of  other  UN 
agencies and programs participate. 

NOAA Tsunami Warning Centers have no authority or responsibility to issue tsu-
nami  warnings  for  the  Indian  Ocean  basin.  However,  knowing  the  concern  Pacific 
countries might have about the potential devastating impact a large earthquake and 
resulting  tsunami  can  inflict,  on  Sunday,  December  26,  2004,  at  8:14  p.m.  EST, 
within 15 minutes of the Indonesian earthquake, both centers issued Tsunami Infor-
mation Bulletins. These bulletins included location and initial magnitude (8.0) infor-
mation  and  an  assessment  that  there  was  no  tsunami  threat  in  the  Pacific.  As  the 
Indian  Ocean  is  outside  the  NOAA  tsunami  area  of  responsibility,  NOAA  Tsunami 
Warning Centers have no procedures in place to issue a warning for this region. An 
hour  and  5  minutes  after  the  earthquake,  as  additional  information  came  in  from

seismic  monitoring  stations  around  the  world,  another  bulletin  was  issued  by  both 
Centers revising the magnitude of the earthquake to 8.5. This time the bulletin con-
tained a statement that the potential existed for a tsunami near the epicenter. Un-
fortunately,  there  was  no  sea-level  data  or  other  information  available  to  substan-
tiate or evaluate a tsunami until 31⁄2 hours after the earthquake when news reports 
began  coming  indicating  casualties  in  Sri  Lanka  and  Thailand.  At  about  the  same 
time,  data  from  the  one  sea-level  gauge  in  the  Indian  Ocean  (Cocos  I;  west  of  Aus-
tralia) was received indicating a 45cm peak-to-trough non-destructive tsunami. 

Sea-level  gauges  are  essential  elements  of  the  current  Tsunami  Warning  System 
in the Pacific. When strategically located, they are used to quickly confirm the exist-
ence  or  non-existence  of  tsunami  waves  following  an  earthquake,  to  monitor  the 
tsunami’s  progress,  and  to  help  estimate  the  severity  of  the  hazard.  There  was  no 
data  available  from  the  Indian  Ocean  to  help  the  warning  centers  know  what  was 
occurring. 

An  effective  tsunami  warning  system  requires  (1)  an  assessment  of  the  tsunami 
hazard,  (2)  near  real-time  seismic  and  oceanographic  (sea-level  change)  data;  (3) 
high-speed data analysis capabilities; (4) a high-speed tsunami warning communica-
tion  system;  and  (5)  an  established  local  communications  infrastructure  for  timely 
and  effective  dissemination  of  the  warning  and  evacuation  requirements.  It  is  also 
critical that coastal populations are educated and prepared to respond appropriately 
to tsunami warnings and calls for evacuations. For the Pacific Basin, these tsunami 
warning  requirements  are  well  known.  Unfortunately,  for  the  Indian  Ocean  basin, 
they were basically non-existent. 

There  are  currently  6  DART  buoys  in  the  Pacific  operated  by  NOAA—3  off  the 
coast  of  Alaska,  2  off  the  coast  of  the  western  U.S.,  and  one  in  the  eastern  Pacific. 
These first buoys of the currently envisioned 29 buoy array are an example of a suc-
cessful  transition  of  buoys  from  research  and  development  into  an  operational  sys-
tem. Presently, three of the deployed DART buoys are non-operational due to failure 
of  the  sea  floor  pressure  unit  (buoys  46401  and  46402;  Aleutian  Islands)  and  com-
munication  module  inside  the  surface  buoy  (buoy  46404;  Pacific  Northwest/Wash-
ington). The Washington buoy has been out of service for 15 months for various rea-
sons. Initially there was a power failure, but when the buoy was retrieved an explo-
sion occurred. Service to all buoys was stopped while a safety stand-down was held 
to  determine  the  cause  of  the  explosion  and  while  a  redesigned  buoy  compartment 
was  implemented  in  all  buoys.  Upon  service,  the  Washington  buoy’s  sea  floor  unit 
failed,  indicating  a  problem  with  undersea  cabling.  A  technical  stand-down  led  to 
further  refinement  of  the  cables.  Weather  conditions  further  delayed  our  attempts 
to bring this buoy back online; the sea floor unit was repaired during a service visit 
in  January.  Unfortunately,  subsequent  to  that  visit  the  buoy  experienced  failure  of 
the  communications  module.  A  service  visit  to  repair  the  Washington  buoy  is  ex-
pected in mid-February. Of the two buoys in the Aleutian Islands, one has been out 
of  service  for  6  months  and  the  other  for  1  month.  As  many  of  you  are  aware,  par-
ticularly  you  Mr.  Chairman,  the  seas  are  particularly  rough  in  this  region  during 
the  winter  months.  We  are  currently  waiting  for  a  safe  weather  window,  and  will 
service the buoys as soon as that window of opportunity presents itself. 

The  government  of  Chile  purchased  one  DART  buoy  from  NOAA,  and  that  buoy 
is  now  operating  off  the  northwest  coast  of  Chile;  another  buoy  is  in  the  process  of 
being purchased by Chile at this time. Japan also operates a few cabled deep ocean 
sensors  off  its  Pacific  coasts.  The  NOAA  buoys  represent  the  only  current  deep 
ocean  capability  available  to  the  Tsunami  Warning  Centers  to  detect  tsunamis.  In 
July  of  last  year,  staff  from  the  Pacific  Center  had  discussions  with  Japanese  rep-
resentatives  about  the  possibility  of  allowing  PTWC  access  to  data  from  the  Japa-
nese cabled buoys. 

While  technical  equipment  is  required  for  detection  and  communication,  equally 
important  are  continued  research  and  development,  and  education  and  outreach  to 
mitigate potential impacts from tsunamis. People must have the knowledge and in-
formation  to  act  during  potentially  life  threatening  events.  Outreach  and  education 
efforts,  such  as  NOAA’s  own  StormReady  and  TsunamiReady  programs,  are  key 
components  of  the  U.S.  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program  (NTHMP). 
These  programs  foster  interaction  between  emergency  managers  and  their  citizens, 
provide  robust  communications  systems,  and  establish  planning  efforts  before  cer-
tification.  NOAA  also  developed  multi-hazard  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment 
training and decision support tools using GIS mapping technology to highlight popu-
lations,  infrastructure  and  critical  facilities  at  risk  for  coastal  hazards.  These  tools 
and  other  support  are  critical  to  land  use  planning,  pre-disaster  planning,  mitiga-
tion  efforts,  and  targeted  dissemination  of  outreach,  education  and  information 
about high-risk areas.

The  International  Strategy  for  Disaster  Reduction  (ISDR)  was  launched  by  the 
General  Assembly  of  the  United  Nations  to  provide  a  global  framework  for  action 
to  reduce  human,  social,  economic,  and  environmental  losses  due  to  natural  and 
man-made hazards. The ISDR aims at building disaster-resilient communities, high-
lighting  the  importance  of  disaster  reduction  as  an  integral  component  of  sustain-
able development. ISDR is the focal point within the United Nations system for co-
ordination  of  strategies  and  programs  for  disaster  reduction  and  to  ensure  synergy 
between  disaster  reduction  activities  and  those  in  the  socioeconomic  and  humani-
tarian  fields.  One  particularly  important  role  of  ISDR  is  to  encourage  both  policy 
and awareness activities by promoting national committees dedicated to disaster re-
duction and by working in close association with regional initiatives. As part of this 
effort,  tsunami  hazard  maps  have  been  produced  for  over  300  coastal  communities 
in over 11 countries, including 130 communities throughout the United States. 

The United Nation’s Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO) 
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) has developed products to help 
countries implement tsunami response plans. Road signs and other mitigation prod-
ucts are available through the NTHMP (http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tsunami-hazard). 
In  summary,  Tsunami  Response  Plans  are  probably  the  most  cost-effective  way  to 
create  a  tsunami  resilient  community.  To  be  successful,  communities  must  remain 
committed  to  a  continuous,  long-term  education  program.  Tsunamis  are  infrequent 
events and it is important to ensure future generations understand tsunami safety. 
Protecting  near-shore  ecosystems,  like  coral  reefs,  is  equally  important  for  main-
taining disaster-resilient communities. The international media and South Asian of-
ficials  reported  less  destruction  in  locations  protected  by  wave-absorbing  healthy 
coral  reefs.  NOAA  and  our  federal,  state,  territorial,  and  international  partners 
work to protect and preserve coral reef ecosystems. 

The United States will continue working closely with the international community 
to  help  implement  recommended  tsunami  detection  and  warning  measures  for  the 
Indian Ocean Basin and other regions of the world currently without adequate tsu-
nami  warning  capability.  A  comprehensive  global  tsunami  warning  program  re-
quires deploying DART buoys along each of the world’s major subduction zones; add-
ing real-time sea-level monitoring/tide gauge stations; establishing Regional Centers 
for Disaster Reduction, assessing hazards, promoting education and outreach efforts; 
and conducting research and development. 

As  recently  announced,  the  Bush  Administration  has  a  plan  to  upgrade  the  cur-
rent U.S. Tsunami Warning System. NOAA’s contribution to this plan includes pro-
curing  and  installing  32  new  DART  buoys,  including  25  new  buoys  in  the  Pacific 
and  7  new  buoys  for  the  Atlantic  and  Caribbean.  We  expect  to  have  the  complete 
network  of  DART  buoys  installed  and  operational  by  mid-2007;  20  buoys  should  be 
operational  in  FY06,  with  the  final  12  in  place  in  FY07.  In  addition  to  the  DART 
buoys,  NOAA  will  procure  and  install  38  new  sea  level  monitoring/tide  gauge  sta-
tions.  The  Administration  has  allocated  $24M,  over  the  next  two  years,  to  NOAA 
for this effort, including $18.1M for the Pacific Basin and $5.9M for Atlantic/Carib-
bean/Gulf. 

There  were  many  lessons  learned  from  the  Indian  Ocean  tsunami.  A  key  point 
to make is that, for all coastal communities, the question is not ‘‘if ’’ a tsunami will 
occur, but ‘‘when.’’ We know what causes a tsunami to develop, and we know a great 
deal  about  how  to  track  them  and  forecast  their  path.  With  expansion  of  the  U.S. 
Tsunami  Warning  System,  NOAA  forecasters  will  be  able  to  detect  nearly  100  per-
cent  of  tsunamis  affecting  the  United  States  and  will  be  able  to  respond  and  alert 
communities  within  minutes  of  a  tsunami-producing  event.  With  expanded  edu-
cation  and  outreach  via  NOAA’s  TsunamiReady  program  and  other  efforts,  we  can 
rest assured that our coastal communities have the opportunity to learn how to re-
spond to a tsunami event and that we have minimized the threat to American lives. 
With  global  attention  on  this  important  matter,  we  have  a  great  opportunity  to 
help  the  world  better  prepare  for  tsunamis  through  the  development  of  a  Global 
Earth  Observation  System  of  Systems  (GEOSS).  This  system  would  include  a  real-
time global seismic monitoring network, a real-time DART network, and a near real-
time sea level monitoring network. I will be a member of the U.S. delegation at the 
Third  Earth  Observation  Summit  (February  16,  2005;  Brussels,  Belgium)  and  will 
work to ensure that the development of a global tsunami warning system is a high 
priority  for  the  larger  Global  Earth  Observation  System  of  Systems  and  the  Inte-
grated Ocean Observing System. 

In closing, I would like to thank Members of this Committee for their work in de-
veloping S. 50, the Tsunami Preparedness Act. The catastrophic event in the Indian 
Ocean highlights the threat tsunamis pose to all coastal communities, and the need 
to defend American communities against future tsunamis. The Department of Com-
merce supports the purposes of this legislation to authorize and strengthen the Na-

tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s tsunami detection, forecast, warn-
ing, mitigation and education and outreach programs. As you know, the Department 
believes  that  in  addition  to  improving  the  ability  to  detect  and  forecast  tsunamis, 
it is equally important to educate citizens on what actions to take when they receive 
a  tsunami  alert.  The  Department  supports  and  appreciates  the  language  that  calls 
for  strengthening  the  TsunamiReady  program,  an  administrative  initiative  to  edu-
cate and prepare communities for survival before and during a tsunami. 

We  look  forward  to  working  with  Congress  and  other  Nations  around  the  world 
to  help  take  the  pulse  of  the  planet  and  make  our  world  a  safer  place.  Attached  to

STATEMENT OF DR. ARDEN L. BEMENT, JR., DIRECTOR, 

NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION 

please? 

Dr.  BEMENT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Member 
Inouye,  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  Thank  you  very  much  for 
the opportunity to present testimony on the National Science Foun-
dation’s role in providing greater——

The  CHAIRMAN.  Could  you  pull  that  microphone  up  closer, 

Dr. BEMENT. Is this better? 
So,  again,  I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  present  testimony 
on  the  National  Science  Foundation’s  role  in  providing  greater  un-
derstanding  and  education  of  tsunami  events  through  science  and 
engineering research. 

Because  the  National  Science  Foundation  has  the  mission  to 
build  the  nation’s  scientific  and  engineering  knowledge  capacity 
and  capability,  NSF  and  the  communities  we  support  have  a  re-
sponsibility  to  undertake  relevant  research  in  the  context  of  these 
events. 

Through  rapid-response  reconnaissance  teams  supported  by  the 
National  Science  Foundation,  we  have  moved  quickly  to  focus  the 
U.S. research community’s efforts to understand the nature of this 
event,  identify  relevant  lessons  for  future  disasters,  and  build  on 
the research that we have funded in the past. 

Our  rapid-response  research  teams  include  problem-focused 
interdisciplinary  collaborations.  In  these  collaborations,  NSF  is 
working with international partners and countries directly affected, 
or  neighboring  the  disaster,  to  improve  communications,  collabora-
tion,  and  priority-setting  as  the  immediate  and  longer-term  re-
search efforts get underway. 

This  disaster  has  raised  awareness  of,  and  attention  to,  earth-
quakes and tsunamis and their predictability. NSF has long funded 
the  research  and  instrumentation  aimed  at  detecting  and  under-
standing the impacts of these phenomena. 

Prominent  examples  include  the  realtime  Global  Seismographic 
Network,  or  GSN,  the  data  from  which  forged  the  critical  core  of 
the early warning of this event. 

From the figures accompanying my written testimony, we see the 
power  of  this  warning  system.  Figure  1,  on  the  easel,  with  the

globe in the center, depicts the location of the GSN stations in rela-
tion to the epicenter of the quake, which is in the center of the dia-
gram. Figure 2 illustrates the collected seismic measurements from 
these  stations  made  as  the  wave  front  traveled  around  the  world. 
These  charts  illustrate  the  power  of  this  network,  which  is  oper-
ated by the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology. 

The  GSN  is  funded,  in  partnership,  by  NSF  and  the  United 
States  Geologic  Survey,  and  it  is  a  primary  international  source  of 
data for earthquake location and also tsunami warning. 

NSF  also  funds  research  designated  to  support  damage  and  loss 
prediction and avoidance. These efforts include the effects of earth-
quakes  and  tsunamis  on  buildings,  bridges,  and  critical  infrastruc-
ture  systems.  Additionally,  research  efforts  center  on  estimating 
economic  consequences,  human  and  societal  impacts,  and  emer-
gency  response  and  warning  capabilities.  For  example,  engineers 
and  scientists  at  the  Earthquake  Engineering  Research  Centers 
and the Southern California Earthquake Center are working to es-
tablish  the  nature,  attenuation,  and  impacts  of  subduction-type 
earthquake  ground-shaking.  These  centers  are  developing  hazard 
assessments that can be applied to critical infrastructure design in 
areas threatened by earthquake and tsunami hazards. 

Mr. Chairman, more than 75 million Americans in 39 states live 
in areas at risk for earthquakes. The NSF has recently established 
the  George  E.  Brown,  Jr.,  Network  for  Earthquake  Engineering 
Simulation, or NEES, as we refer to it. This is a major national in-
frastructure  project  that  is  revolutionizing  earthquake  engineering 
research.  It  allows  NSF-funded  researchers  to  create  physical  and 
computational  simulations  in  order  to  study  how  earthquakes  and 
tsunamis  affect  our  critical  infrastructure.  The  NEES  Tsunami 
Wave  Basin  at  Oregon  State  University  is  the  world’s  most  com-
prehensive facility for studying tsunamis and storm waves. 

Mr. Chairman, thank you, again, for the opportunity to testify on 
a topic of great importance to the science and engineering commu-
nities.  I  hope  that  I  have  conveyed  to  you  the  NSF’s  serious  ap-
proach  to  generate  new  knowledge  about  the  natural  phenomena 
that  lead  to  tsunami  events,  also  the  design  of  safer  coastal  struc-
tures, the development of early warning and response systems, and 
effective steps for disaster recovery. 

Thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. ARDEN L. BEMENT, JR., DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SCIENCE 

FOUNDATION 

Good  morning.  Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Member  Inouye,  and  Members  of  the 
Committee,  thank  you  very  much  for  the  opportunity  to  present  testimony  on  the 
National Science Foundation’s role in providing greater science and research to un-
derstanding tsunami events. 

The events surrounding the December 26, 2004, Sumatra-Andaman Island earth-
quake  and  Indian  Ocean  tsunami  constitute  disasters  for  the  natural,  social,  and 
constructed  environments  in  the  region.  Because  the  National  Science  Foundation 
(NSF) has the mission to build the nation’s scientific and engineering knowledge ca-
pacity  and  capability,  NSF  and  the  communities  we  support  have  a  responsibility 
to undertake relevant research in the context of the events. 

NSF has moved quickly to focus the U.S. research community to address the dis-
aster,  response,  and  relevant  lessons  for  future  disasters,  building  on  the  research 
related  to  these  topics  that  we  have  funded  in  the  past.  Later  in  my  testimony,  I 
will  detail  the  ways  our  previous  research  has  contributed  to  the  ability  of  the

United  States  and  others  to  understand  and  respond  to  the  disaster,  and  informa-
tion  on  the  NSF’s  role  in  supporting  the  U.S.  research  community’s  immediate  re-
sponse to the tragedy. 

This  disaster  has  revealed  several  areas  in  which  understanding—as  well  as  in-
frastructure—were  insufficient  to  deal  with  the  crisis,  and  where  NSF’s  research 
communities  can  bring  basic  knowledge  and  relevant  infrastructure  to  bear.  The 
U.S.  communities  include  problem-focused,  interdisciplinary  research  teams,  often 
with  international  partners  in  mutually  beneficial  and  sustainable  collaborations. 
NSF is working with counterpart organizations in countries directly affected by the 
disaster,  as  well  as  other  countries  in  the  region,  to  improve  communications,  col-
laboration,  and  priority  setting  as  the  immediate  and  longer-term  research  efforts 
get underway. 

This  disaster  has  raised  awareness  of  and  attention  to  the  phenomena  of  earth-
quakes  and  tsunamis,  and  their  predictability.  NSF  has  long  funded  scientific  and 
engineering  research  infrastructure  aimed  at  detecting  and  understanding  the  im-
pacts  of  these  phenomena.  Prominent  examples  include  the  real-time  Global  Seis-
mographic Network (GSN), the data from which forged the critical core of the early 
warning  of  the  December  26,  2004,  earthquake.  This  Network,  operated  by  the  In-
corporated  Research  Institutions  for  Seismology,  is  funded  in  partnership  by  NSF 
and  the  United  States  Geological  Survey,  and  is  the  primary  international  source 
of data for earthquake location and tsunami warning. 

We also fund research designed to support damage and loss prediction and avoid-
ance for the United States and elsewhere, including earthquake and tsunami effects 
on buildings, bridges, and critical infrastructure systems, and estimates of economic 
consequences,  human  and  societal  impacts,  and  emergency  response.  For  example, 
engineers  and  scientists  at  the  Earthquake  Engineering  Research  Centers  and  the 
Southern California Earthquake Center are working to establish the nature and at-
tenuation  of  subduction-type  earthquake  ground  shaking,  and  to  develop  prob-
abilistic  hazard  assessments  that  can  be  applied  to  critical  infrastructure  design  in 
areas threatened by earthquake and tsunami hazards. NSF has recently established 
the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES), 
a major national infrastructure project to create a complete system of test facilities. 
The  project  is  revolutionizing  earthquake-engineering  research.  NSF-funded  re-
searchers  create  physical  and  computational  simulations  in  order  to  study  how 
earthquakes  and  tsunamis  affect  buildings,  bridges,  ports,  and  other  critical  infra-
structure.  The  NEES  Tsunami  Wave  Basin  at  Oregon  State  University  is  the 
world’s most comprehensive facility for studying tsunamis and storm waves. 

These  globally  historic  earthquake  and  tsunami  events  have  heightened  aware-
ness  in  the  engineering  and  science  research  communities  of  the  huge  responsibil-
ities  to  create  new  knowledge  about  our  human  and  organizational  environments, 
natural biologic systems, constructed environments, and about our vulnerabilities in 
the  face  of  damaging  forces.  It  is  important  that  the  work  includes  all  aspects  of 
environmental damage, mitigation, response, and recovery. 
The National Science Foundation Research Portfolio 

The  tremendous  loss  of  lives  and  destruction  of  the  natural  and  built  environ-
ments  resulting  from  the  December  26  events  brought  to  the  forefront  questions 
about  disaster  preparation,  mitigation,  response,  and  recovery.  NSF’s  research  in-
vestments  have  developed  a  knowledge  and  human  resource  base  over  broad  areas 
relevant  to  these  questions.  Current  and  past  pertinent  research  activities  include: 
Earthquakes:  The  Sumatra  earthquake  occurred  along  a  subduction  zone  where 
tectonic plates collide. These subduction quakes are the largest and most destructive 
type  of  earthquake,  and  cause  most  of  the  world’s  tsunamis.  NSF  researchers  have 
been  making  exciting  advancements  in  subduction  zone  research  including  new 
techniques and facilities that define the structure, chemistry and dynamics of active 
subduction  zones.  A  prime  example  is  the  findings  about  the  Cascadia  subduction 
zone  in  the  U.S.  Pacific  Northwest.  This  fault  structure  generated  a  9.0Mw  earth-
quake  on  January  26,  1700,  with  a  tsunami  that  destroyed  whole  forests  on  the 
largely uninhabited Oregon coast, toppled buildings on Vancouver Island, and killed 
coastal dwellers in Japan. 

Tsunami  Generation:  NSF  research  includes  field  studies  using  research  vessels 
and  other  platforms  and  facilities,  including  the  Integrated  Ocean  Drilling  Pro-
gram’s  (IODP)  drill  ship  the  Joides  Resolution.  NSF  research  aims  to  understand 
the processes by which earthquakes, large slumps, and other landslips generate tsu-
nami waves, and to model how tsunamis interact with the shore zone, including the 
nature of present and past sediment deposits left by tsunamis. 

Rapid  Response  Reconnaissance:  NSF  supports  the  Earthquake  Engineering  Re-
search  Institute  (EERI)  and  its  Learning  from  Earthquakes  (LFE)  project  that

trains and deploys rapid-response teams of civil engineers, geoengineers, and social 
scientists  to  earthquakes  that  occur  around  the  world.  These  teams  identify  infor-
mation  resources,  research  needs,  and  provide  ground  truthing  for  remotely  sensed 
observations. NSF also funds the Natural Hazards Research and Applications Infor-
mation  Center  at  the  University  of  Colorado  at  Boulder,  which  supports  rapid-re-
sponse  research  by  social  science  researchers,  and  leads  the  world  as  a  clearing-
house for multidisciplinary and social science studies of hazards and disasters. 

Remote  Sensing:  Remote-sensing  technologies  quantify  damage  over  large  geo-
graphic  areas  and  provide  reconnaissance  information  where  access  to  impacted 
areas is difficult. For the first time, high-resolutions sensors (Quickbird and Ikonos), 
moderate-resolution  sensors  (SPOT,  LandSat,  and  IRS),  and  low-resolution  sensors 
(MODIS,  Aster)  are  recording  the  Indian  Ocean  events  in  near  real-time.  With  this 
information  it  will  be  possible  to  identify  and  quantify  damage  and  impacts  to  crit-
ical infrastructure systems (including electric power systems, water supply, sewage, 
transportation,  safe  shelter  buildings,  ports,  and  harbors).  Such  assessments  can 
then be verified by on-the-ground inspections. 

Physical  and  Computational  Simulation:  Tsunami  disasters  are  dominated  by 
coastal damage and loss of life. Scientists and engineers need to predict site-specific 
wave run-up patterns and determine tsunami-induced forces and scour effects to en-
able better design of waterfront structures and help guide decision-making processes 
including  vulnerability  assessment.  NSF  research  has  developed  scenario  simula-
tions  for  tsunami  hazard  mitigation,  including  tsunami  generation,  hydrodynamics, 
warning  transmission,  evacuation,  human  behavior,  and  social  and  environmental 
impacts. The NEES Tsunami Wave Basin is being used to construct and test large-
scale,  realistic  models  of  infrastructure—such  as  shorelines,  underwater  pipelines, 
port facilities, and coastal communities. 

Sensor  Networks:  NSF  research  investigates  new  uses  for  and  new  kinds  of  sen-
sors  and  networks  for  health  monitoring  and  damage  assessment  of  the  civil  infra-
structure, both physical and cyber. Flexible and scalable software architectures and 
frameworks  are  being  developed  to  integrate  real-time  heterogeneous  sensor  data, 
database  and  archiving  systems,  computer  vision,  data  analysis  and  interpretation, 
numerical simulation of complex structural systems, visualization, probabilistic risk 
analysis,  and  rational  statistical  decision  making  procedures.  NSF  has  also  funded 
research  on  socio-technical  arrangements  for  bringing  information  to  policymakers. 
Risk Assessment: Risk assessment and decisions about preparing for risks are im-
mediately  relevant  topics  that  NSF-funded  scientists  have  researched  in  depth. 
Basic science and engineering research provides the in-depth understanding needed 
to  design  effective  detection,  warning,  mitigation,  response,  and  recovery  programs. 
Research  on  risk  communication  and  decision-making  regarding  low-probability, 
high-consequence  events  is  being  applied  to  many  types  of  disasters.  Key  for  appli-
cation  of  engineering  knowledge  is  to  establish  the  basis  for  performance-based  de-
sign  to  be  applied  to  all  critical  infrastructure  systems  and  facilities  of  the  con-
structed environment. 

Warning Systems and Evacuation: NSF has supported extensive and long-term re-
search  on  warning  systems  and  evacuation,  with  clear  implications  for  managing 
tsunami  events.  NSF  research  includes  basic  work  on  integrated  warning  systems 
for  rapid-onset  extreme  events,  including  detection,  modeling,  and  communications 
technologies, and also the social and organizational components needed for effective 
warnings:  societal  and  community  public  education  and  preparedness,  appropriate 
authorities  and  resources  for  organizational  and  governmental  entities  responsible 
for  warning  and  evacuation  processes,  appropriate  messages  and  means  of  dissemi-
nation to at-risk populations, and the management and maintenance of warning sys-
tems over time. One specific focus for research has been sensor networks that must 
‘‘funnel’’ a sudden impulse of data that is generated due to an anomalous event such 
as an earthquake, terrorist attack, flood, or fire. The objective is to understand how 
to  design  sensor  networks  to  adequately  handle  these  impulses  of  data  and  to  feed 
the information into public warning systems. 

Behavioral Responses: Emotional and cognitive responses to stress as well as vul-
nerability  and  resiliency  in  the  face  of  threat  and  terror  are  the  focus  on  current 
research in social psychology. Research in geography and regional science examines 
patterns  of  settlement  that  lead  to  social  vulnerability  and  the  differential  impact 
of  hazards,  including  earthquake  hazards,  on  different  groups.  An  earlier  study  ex-
ploring the restoration of assumptions of safety and control following the 2001 terror 
attacks  has  direct  implications  for  understanding  the  restoration  of  human 
wellbeing following these devastating events. 

Human  and  Socio-technological  Response:  Behavioral  and  social  science  research 
funded by NSF provides insights about how people respond to disasters and identi-
fies the short- and long-term effects. Scientists have documented and analyzed social

phenomena in the immediate wake of disasters, such as altruism, volunteerism, con-
vergence,  and  improvisation.  These  phenomena  vary  by  country  and  culture.  NSF 
researchers  are  developing  distributed,  reliable,  and  secure  information  systems 
that  can  evolve  and  adapt  to  radical  changes  in  their  environment.  Such  systems 
would  deliver  critically  important  services  for  emergency  communication  and  man-
agement  through  networked  information  services  and  up-to-date  sensor  data  over 
ad-hoc  flexible,  fault-tolerant  networks  that  adapt  to  the  people  and  organizations 
that  need  them.  Such  technology  facilitates  access  to  the  right  information,  for  the 
right  individuals  and  organizations,  at  the  right  time.  This  is  necessary  to  provide 
security,  to  serve  our  dynamic  virtual  response  organizations,  and  to  support  the 
changing  social  and  cultural  aspects  of  information-sharing  among  organizations 
and individuals. 

Emergency Response Research: The complex problems associated with earthquake 
and tsunami hazard mitigation and response strategies necessitate interdisciplinary 
and  international  research  efforts,  including  modeling  and  computational  simula-
tion,  large-scale  laboratory  modeling,  geographical  information  and  communication 
systems,  and  social  sciences  and  planning.  NSF  supports  research  on  social,  polit-
ical, and managerial aspects of emergency response activities and aid provision, in-
cluding need-based distribution of assistance within diverse societies. 

Ecology:  Research  on  the  ecology  of  infectious  disease  contributes  to  under-
standing  the  dynamics  of  epidemics  and  change,  particularly  in  the  context  of  eco-
logical changes such as those following natural disasters. Disturbance ecology exam-
ines  how  biological  populations,  communities  and  ecosystems  respond  to  extreme 
natural and human events, including hurricanes and tsunamis. Long-term ecological 
research  is  critical  to  understanding  the  base  line  conditions,  without  which  the 
changes  resulting  from  catastrophic  events  such  as  earthquakes  and  tsunamis  can-
not be understood. 

Microbial  Genome  Sequencing:  NSF  funded  research  on  microbial  genome  se-
quencing provides key information that enables identification and understanding of 
the life functions and ecology of microbes that play critical roles in the environment, 
agriculture, food and water safety, and may cause disease in humans, animals, and 
plants.  Genome  sequence  information  can  be  utilized  to  develop  tools  to  detect  dis-
ease-causing  organisms  and  develop  countermeasures  such  as  antimicrobial  chemi-
cals and vaccines. 

Education  and  Human  Resources:  NSF  has  dozens  of  active  projects  funded  that 
target or include Earth science education and understanding of natural hazards. For 
example,  the  NSF  National  Science,  Mathematics,  Engineering,  and  Technology 
Education  (SMETE)  Digital  Library  program  is  supporting  a  multi-year  project  to 
develop a data-oriented digital library collection on education in plate tectonics, the 
central  Earth  science  paradigm  governing  earthquakes  and  resultant  tsunamis. 
Such  a  collection  works  to  ‘‘bridge  the  gap’’  between  science  data  archives  and  li-
braries,  and  improves  access  to  the  historic  and  modern  marine  geological  and  geo-
physical  data.  Further,  the  project  is  enhancing  the  professional  development  of 
teachers  through  interactions  with  a  local  school  district  and  with  teachers  nation-
wide.  Also,  NSF  has  supported  the  incorporation  of  advanced  technologies  in  K–12 
learning  materials  in  Earth  science,  including  visualizations  and  working  with  im-
ages  from  space,  real-time  data,  and  experimentation  with  models  and  simulations 
(techniques  used  in  earthquake  events  to  generate  model  predictions  of  tsunamis). 
This  work  was  utilized  to  update  and  improve  one  of  the  most  widely  used  high-
school Earth science textbooks. 
NSF Investments in Research Infrastructure 

The  natural  disaster  raised  awareness  of  and  attention  to  the  phenomena  of 
earthquakes  and  tsunamis,  and  their  predictability.  NSF  has  long  funded  scientific 
and  engineering  research  infrastructure  aimed  at  detecting  and  understanding  the 
impacts of these phenomena. Prominent examples include:

• IRIS,  GSN—Real-time  Global  Seismographic  Network  (GSN)  data  forged  the 
critical  core  of  the  early  warning  of  the  December  26,  2004,  Sumatran  Earth-
quake. The GSN, operated by IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seis-
mology)  and  funded  in  partnership  by  NSF  and  the  United  States  Geological 
Survey, is the primary international source of data for earthquake location and 
tsunami warning.

• Engineers  and  scientists  at  the  Earthquake  Engineering  Research  Centers 1 
(EERCs) and the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC at the Univer-
sity of Southern California) are working to establish the nature and attenuation 
of subduction-type earthquake ground shaking, and to develop probabilistic haz-
ard maps and shaking levels due to subduction earthquakes in all oceans. This 
information  will  support  damage  prediction  for  the  U.S.  and  elsewhere,  includ-
ing  earthquake  and  tsunami  effects  on  buildings,  bridges  and  other  lifelines, 
and estimates of economic, safety, and emergency response consequences.
• NSF has completed construction of the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earth-
quake  Engineering  Simulation  (NEES),  a  major  national  infrastructure  project 
to  create  a  complete  system  of  test  facilities  that  is  revolutionizing  earthquake 
engineering  research.  NSF-funded  researchers  create  physical  and  numerical 
simulations  in  order  to  study  how  earthquakes  and  tsunamis  affect  buildings, 
bridges,  ports,  and  other  critical  infrastructure.  The  NEES  Tsunami  Wave 
Basin at Oregon State University is the world’s most comprehensive facility for 
studying tsunamis and storm waves.

The National Science Foundation’s Immediate Response 

For  more  than  three  decades,  NSF  has  supported  quick-response  disaster  studies 
that dispatch scientists and engineers to the aftermath of crises ranging from hurri-
canes  and  earthquakes  to  the  terrorist  attacks  of  September  11,  2001.  Researchers 
were  in  the  field  within  days  after  the  South  Asian  tsunami  to  gather  critical  data 
before  it  was  lost  to  nature  and  reconstruction.  The  ephemeral  information,  includ-
ing assessments of physical damage to both the built and natural environments, as 
well as social science research that will help emergency teams and local leaders bet-
ter  direct  future  rescue  efforts,  is  vital  for  scientists  and  engineers  to  understand 
and prepare for future disasters. 

A variety of mechanisms are available to support quick-response research, includ-
ing the following: (1) Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER), which may be 
awarded  in  order  to  gather  data  that  is  likely  to  disappear  over  time  after  the  im-
pact of disasters; (2) supplements to existing awards to fund data collection; (3) spe-
cific  continuing  grants  that  support  quick-response  field  reconnaissance  and  re-
search across a variety of disciplines; and (4) flexibility inherent in existing awards 
that allows for the support of post-disaster investigations. NSF has already utilized 
all  of  these  types  of  support  in  responding  to  the  December  26,  2004,  earthquake 
and tsunami in the Indian Ocean. 

Several  programs  and  projects  have  established  funding  to  send  rapid  response 

teams to disaster sites: 

NSF Earthquake Engineering Research Centers are undertaking work on damage 
assessment.  The  Multidisciplinary  Center  for  Earthquake  Engineering  Research 
(MCEER) sent a team of researchers to Thailand in partnership with the Asian In-
stitute of Technology and the Earthquake Disaster Mitigation Research Center from 
Japan.  Shubharoop  Ghosh  from  ImageCat  will  join  a  team  led  by  Prof.  Yamazaki 
of Chiba University. The team is examining impacts of the earthquake and tsunami 
upon  buildings  and  critical  infrastructure.  Research  is  also  being  supported  by  the 
earthquake centers on validating the potential of remote sensing data to accurately 
assess damage and impacts. 

Multidisciplinary  research  has  been  undertaken  through  the  NSF-funded  Learn-
ing  From  Earthquakes  (LFE)  Program  that  is  managed  by  the  Earthquake  Engi-
neering  Research  Institute  (EERI),  a  non-profit  institution  in  Oakland,  California. 
LFE  is  sending  two  teams  to  Sri  Lanka,  Thailand,  the  Maldive  Islands,  and  India. 
The  teams  will  gather  data  on  estimated  wave  heights,  extent  of  inundation,  geo-
logical scouring, and other perishable information related to the physical aspects of 
tsunamis.  They  will  coordinate  their  work  with  teams  from  Japan  and  Australia. 
In  addition,  other  EERI  activities  will  collect  data.  Jose  Borrero,  University  of 
Southern  California,  was  one  of  the  first  U.S.  researchers  to  gain  access  to  one  of 
the hardest-hit area of Sumatra. A 13-member team of engineers led by EERI mem-
ber Sudhir Jain, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, is investigating the struc-
tural damage and impacts on port facilities along the eastern coast of India, as well 
as on the Adaman and Nicobar Islands. 

These  initial  EERI  teams  include  geotechnical,  structural,  and  coastal  engineers; 
geologists;  geophysicists;  and  experts  in  fluid  mechanics.  In  subsequent  efforts,  a 
joint  EERI/ASCE  team  of  engineers  will  travel  to  the  area  along  with  social  sci-

1 MAE  (Mid  America  Earthquake  Center  at  the  University  of  Illinois,  Urbana-Champaign), 
MCEER  (Multidisciplinary  Center  for  Earthquake  Engineering  Research  at  the  University  of 
Buffalo) and PEER (Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center at the University of Cali-
fornia, Berkeley).

entists from the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware. They will 
focus  on  damage  to  lifelines,  including  highways,  bridges,  ports  and  harbors,  water 
delivery systems, sewage facilities, and other utilities. They will also begin to docu-
ment the resulting impacts on communities and the entire region. These impacts in-
clude search and rescue operations, medical response, multinational relief, organiza-
tional response, effects on children and families, shelter and housing, and social and 
economic impacts. Members of EERI and other earthquake engineering experts who 
reside in the affected countries will also contribute the results of their independent 
investigations.  These  reports  will  be  compiled  on  the  EERI  website,  published  by 
EERI as part of the LFE program, and made available internationally. 

NSF’s Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) is a major source 
of information about tsunamis. The O.H. Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory at Or-
egon  State  University,  home  to  the  largest  tsunami  research  facility  in  the  world, 
was sought out as a source of answers to the pressing questions in the wake of the 
disaster.  The  lab  hosted  local  news  teams  as  well  as  CNN,  NBC’s  ‘‘ Today  Show,’’ 
the Discovery Channel, and Spiegel TV from Germany. 

The  Directorate  for  Geosciences  is  offering  SGERs  and  award  supplements  to 
study physical processes in the earthquake-tsunami zone. For example, NSF-funded 
investigators from the California Institute of Technology who were already studying 
uplift  or  subsidence  of  atolls  in  the  earthquake  zone  returned  to  Sumatra  imme-
diately  after  the  event  to  measure  earthquake-related  vertical  displacements.  Addi-
tionally,  scientists  from  the  University  of  California-San  Diego  plan  to  resurvey  a 
network  of  approximately  fifty  geodetic  monuments  in  North  Sumatra,  the 
Mentawai  Islands,  and  Banda  Aceh  to  determine  coseismic  and  postseismic  defor-
mation caused by the Sumatra earthquake. These new data will provide critical geo-
detic  constraints  for  the  seismographic  inversion  of  the  earthquake  source  to  con-
strain models of the subsequent devastating tsunamis and to contribute to the study 
of  the  great  earthquake  cycle  in  that  region.  The  NSF-funded  geodetic  consortium 
UNAVCO  Inc.  is  coordinating  efforts  by  the  scientific  community  to  measure  the 
post-earthquake  distortion  in  the  region  of  the  earthquake.  The  NSF-funded  seis-
mology consortium IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology) is lead-
ing efforts to develop real-time, finite-fault modeling techniques so that information 
on the actual characterization of the earthquake source can be updated continuously 
as real-time seismic data are received. 

The  oceanographic  communities  are  actively  mapping  the  earthquake  rupture 
zone,  studying  aftershock  events,  and  venting  of  natural  fluids  using  ocean  bottom 
seismometers, ships, remotely operated vehicles, and potentially autonomous under-
sea vehicles. In addition, the NSF’s Division of Ocean Sciences will sponsor a series 
of  free,  on-line  workshops  for  K–12  teachers  that  will  provide  them  with  lesson 
plans, teaching materials, and access to scientists so that they can present the latest 
scientific tsunami information to their students. These workshops will reach several 
thousand  teachers  this  month  alone,  with  additional  workshops  possible  dependent 
upon demand. A major challenge for these oceanographic studies is gaining permis-
sion  from  the  Indonesian  government  to  conduct  research  in  its  territorial  waters. 
The  Directorate  for  Computer  and  Information  Science  and  Engineering  will  be 
offering  SGERs  and  award  supplements  to  extend  projects  on  sensor  networks  for 
damage  identification,  information  about  the  location  of  survivors,  emergency  re-
sponse infrastructure technology, and the ability of organizations to respond to man-
made and natural disasters. The San Diego Supercomputer Center at the University 
of  California,  San  Diego  has  offered  computational  and  data  integration  and  data 
backup  resources  to  local  universities,  facilities,  or  government  agencies  that  might 
need them. 

The  Human  and  Social  Dynamics  (HSD)  priority  area  has  allocated  $1  million  to 
support SGERs for multidisciplinary research, including such issues as warning sys-
tems, disaster epidemiology, crisis decision-making, emergency response, and short-
term  and  long-term  recovery  and  mitigation.  These  awards  will  be  established  by 
the end of February 2005. Additional funding will be available from the NEES pro-
gram to archive data collected under these SGERs in the central data repository op-
erated  by  NEES  Consortium,  Inc.  The  Directorate  for  Social,  Behavioral,  and  Eco-
nomic Sciences has also made special funds available for SGERs pertinent to learn-

Conclusion 

Mr.  Chairman,  as  you  well  know  NSF  has  as  its  mission  the  promotion  of  the 
progress of science, the advancement of the national health, prosperity and welfare, 
and  the  securing  of  the  national  defense.  Since  science  is  truly  global  in  nature, 
NSF  engages  in  these  activities  in  collaboration  with  international  partners.  As 
such, NSF will continue to respond to disasters such as the earthquake and tsunami

events  in  partnership  with  others  in  the  global  science  and  engineering  commu-
nities. 

The  South  Asian  tsunami  disaster  is  representative  of  an  entire  class  of  cata-
strophic disasters: events that are low probability yet have high consequences. With 
the right information, communities and nations can characterize such risks and de-
termine how to allocate resources for detection, warning, and preparedness. 

Research into decision-making provides insights and tools for characterizing such 
risks and for addressing future questions about allocating resources to detection and 
warning. NSF, in cooperation with the world research community, including the sci-
entists,  engineers,  and  students  from  the  affected  countries,  will  continue  to  gen-
erate  new  knowledge  about  the  natural  phenomena  of  these  events,  the  design  of 
better  coastal  structures,  the  development  of  early  warning  and  response  systems 
that  can  mitigate  loss  of  life,  and  recovery  from  such  disasters.  These  new  bodies 
of  knowledge  need  to  be  transferable  to  all  regions  of  the  world  that  can  benefit 
from  these  efforts.  With  NSF  support,  scientists  will  continue  to  study  societal  vul-
nerability  to  natural  hazards  with  a  view  to  building  resilience  through  increased 
knowledge  and  preparedness,  improved  natural  resource  management,  and  other 
policy  strategies  so  that  we  may  help  stem  the  loss  of  life  and  property  in  future 
events. 

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  again  for  this  opportunity  to  testify  on  a  topic  of  great 
importance  to  the  world  community.  I  hope  that  I  have  conveyed  the  serious  ap-
proach that NSF has taken to help generate new knowledge about the natural phe-
nomena  that  lead  to  tsunami  events,  the  design  of  safer  coastal  structures,  the  de-
velopment  of  early  warning  and  response  systems,  and  effective  steps  for  disaster 
recovery. 

I would be pleased to answer any questions you might have.

STATEMENT OF CHARLES G. GROAT, DIRECTOR, U.S. 

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY 

Dr. GROAT. Thank you, Senator Stevens. 
Senators  Frist  and  Landrieu  gave  you  a  good  sense  of  the  dra-
matic  impact  that  this  dramatic  event  had.  Let  me  give  you  a 
sense, in beginning, of the forces of the earth that caused it. 

The  December  26,  2004,  a  magnitude-nine  earthquake  was  initi-
ated 20 miles below the sea floor off the western coast of Sumatra. 
It  was  the  fourth-largest  earthquake  to  strike  the  planet  since 
1900,  and  the  largest  since  a  magnitude–9.2  struck  your  state, 
Alaska, Senator Stevens, in 1964. As with other giant earthquakes, 
this  one  took  place  along  the  subduction  zone,  where  the  tectonic 
plates  that  make  up  the  earth’s  rigid  outer  layer  are  thrust  be-
neath one another. This thrusting resulted in a rupture that propa-
gated northward along the plate boundary fault for over 750 miles. 
Along  the  length  of  that  fault,  the  sea  floor  was  jolted  upward  as 
much as 15 feet, lifting trillions of gallons of water into the air, and 
resulting in the forces that provided the tsunami. 

While not all tsunamis are caused by earthquakes, most of them 
are. So, therefore, the earthquake monitoring system that Director 
Bement referred to is critical in providing information about where 
tsunamis  are  likely  to  occur.  And  so,  the  network  is  extremely  im-
portant,  and  it  has  to  be  up  to  the  task  of  providing  information 
about  the  earthquakes  in  a  very  sophisticated  and  very  timely 
manner.  The  GSN  that  he  referred  to  is  the  key  part,  on  a  global 
scale, of doing that. And with 128 globally distributed seismic sen-
sors  that  are  all  very  modern,  we  have  the  infrastructure  in  place 
to provide the core part of the knowledge that is necessary to inter-
pret  whether  earthquakes  will  generate  tsunamis  or  not,  if  they 
occur in ocean basins. 

A  little  closer  to  home,  in  the  United  States,  the  USGS  operates 
an  advanced  national  seismic  system  which  provides  seismic  data 
to  NOAA’s  Tsunami  Warning  Centers.  That  system  includes  a  63-
station backbone network that is, itself, very modern, and provides 
information supported by 17 regional seismic networks that ensure 
that the United States has adequate and detailed coverage for pro-
viding this kind of information. 

As  a  result  of  the  Indian  Ocean  tsunami,  the  President  an-
nounced  and  asked  the  Departments  of  Commerce  and  Interior  to 
determine whether our systems were adequate. As a result of that, 
the United States Geological Survey has put together a plan to up-
grade our seismic system capabilities and our interpretive capabili-
ties,  both  to  provide  NOAA  with  the  information  it  needs  as  to 
whether these earthquakes that occur on plate boundaries will gen-
erate  tsunamis,  and  also  to  provide  information  locally  to  the 
United States coastal communities, as they need it. 

So let me close by just indicating what it is we’re doing. 
We’re  implementing  24-by-7  operations  at  our  National  Earth-
quake  Information  Center,  where  the  information  is  gathered  and 
sent out. 

We’re  upgrading  the  hardware  and  software  there  to  make  sure 
that  we  have  the  sophisticated  processing  that’s  necessary  to  give 
the  interpretive  information,  both  on  the  global  sense  and  in  the 
U.S. sense.

32

We’re  also  improving  the  detection  response  time  of  the  Global 
Seismographic Network by making data from all stations realtime. 
In  other  words,  we  get  the  information  when  it’s  received  by  the 
stations,  not  with  any  delays.  Only  80  percent  of  that  network  is 
realtime right now. 

We’re  also  increasing  the  maintenance  schedules  for  all  of  the 
stations so that we have data available as continuously as possible. 
We’re  also  providing  some  new  software  that  was  generated  by 
the  California  Integrated  Seismic  Network,  which  is  a  USGS  uni-
versity  and  state  partnership,  to  speed  USGS-generated  earth-
quake  information  directly  to  local  emergency  managers.  And  this 
is  extremely  important  in  coastal  communities,  because  earth-
quakes that generate tsunamis close to shore have to be responded 
to  very  quickly.  There  isn’t  the  time,  nor  the  instrumentation,  be-
tween  those  and  the  shore  to  provide  the  warnings.  So  the  earth-
quake  is  a  key  part  of  what  coastal  communities  need  to  have  in 
which  to  base  their  warning  systems.  So  we’re  upgrading  our  abil-
ity to do that. 

And, finally, we’re also increasing the geologic studies that occur 
around  the  margins  of  the  United  States  and  in  the  Caribbean  to 
understand  the  past  frequency  of  tsunamis,  which  gives  us  some 
sense  of  when  and  where  they  occur,  and  the  magnitude  of  those. 
The  Sumatra  Earthquake,  which  contributed  significantly  to  the 
loss  of  lives  and  property,  also  continues  us  to  forward  our  com-
prehensive concern about earthquakes, themselves, because they do 
occur  more  frequently,  and  they  do  destroy  lives  and  property  on 
a more regular basis, and in a very destructive basis. And through 
the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, in which we 
partner with the National Science Foundation with NIST and with 
FEMA,  we  will  also  work  with  other  agencies  and  universities  to 
improve tsunami hazard assessments and warnings, and to expand 
our  knowledge  of  tsunami  generation  and  the  impacts,  and  to 
evaluate  the  research  and  operational  requirements  for  effective 
hazards planning, warning, and response systems. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
[The prepared statement of Dr. Groat follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. CHARLES G. GROAT, DIRECTOR, U.S. GEOLOGICAL 

SURVEY 

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to 
discuss the recent tragedy in South Asia and what can be done to reduce the threat 
that  tsunamis  and  earthquakes  pose  to  coastal  communities  in  the  United  States 
and around the globe. Events such as this serve as a tragic reminder of our vulner-
ability to natural hazards. While the United States is not as vulnerable to tsunamis 
as other regions of the world, we do face significant risk. 

On  December  29,  the  President  asked  the  Departments  of  the  Interior  and  Com-
merce to determine whether our systems are adequately prepared for a tsunami on 
our coasts. As a result, the Administration announced its commitment to implement 
an  improved  domestic  tsunami  detection  and  warning  system.  As  part  of  the  Presi-
dent’s  plan,  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS)  will  strengthen  its  ability  to  detect 
global  earthquakes  both  through  improvements  in  the  Global  Seismographic  Net-
work (GSN), which we support jointly with the National Science Foundation (NSF), 
and  through  around-the-clock  analysis  of  earthquake  events.  The  changes  that  are 
proposed  for  USGS  clearly  have  a  dual  purpose,  improving  our  capacity  to  respond 
to earthquakes as well as supporting the tsunami warning program of the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 

In addition to earthquake monitoring and reporting, the USGS conducts a number 
of activities aimed at improving tsunami hazard assessments, education, and warn-

ings,  including  geologic  investigations  into  the  history  of  and  potential  for  tsunami 
occurrence,  coastal  and  marine  mapping,  and  modeling  tsunami  generation.  Al-
though  most  tsunamis  are  caused  by  earthquakes,  they  can  also  be  caused  by  vol-
canic  eruptions,  submarine  landslides,  and  onshore  landslides  that  cause  large  vol-
umes of rock to fall into the water. All of these tsunami-generating hazards can im-
pact  the  United  States.  Consequently,  a  broad  range  of  USGS  work  in  earthquake, 
volcano and landslide hazards, and coastal and marine geology, contribute to better 
understanding of tsunami impacts and occurrences. 

Additionally,  USGS  is  playing  a  role  in  relief  efforts  for  nations  impacted  by  the 
December  26  disaster  by  providing  relief  organizations  worldwide  with  pre-  and 
post-tsunami satellite images and image-derived products that incorporate informa-
tion  on  population  density,  elevation,  and  other  relevant  topics.  These  images  and 
products are being used by relief organizations to determine where relief efforts are 
most  critical  and  how  best  to  carry  out  those  relief  operations.  In  our  efforts  to  as-
sist  and  improve  relief  efforts,  we  work  closely  with  partners  at  NOAA,  the  U.S. 
Agency for International Development, other federal agencies, and in academia. For 
example,  USGS  scientists  are  part  of  international  teams  conducting  post-tsunami 
investigations  in  Sri  Lanka  and  Indonesia  with  the  goal  of  applying  the  knowledge 
developed to other vulnerable areas in the United States and around the globe. 

USGS  is  also  working  with  NOAA  and  other  domestic  and  global  partners 
through the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS) and other mecha-
nisms.  Through  GEOSS,  improved  monitoring  capabilities  must  be  firmly  linked 
into  all-hazards  warning  systems  and,  the  most  important  link  in  the  chain,  public 
education  and  mitigation  programs.  As  we  move  forward,  we  must  bear  in  mind 
that  this  was  an  earthquake  disaster  as  well  as  a  tsunami  disaster,  and  we  must 
learn from both. This is not just a scientific endeavor; it is a matter of public safety. 
Earthquake and Tsunami of December 26, 2004

This  was  the  second  year  in  a  row  in  which  a  deadly  earthquake  occurred  near 
the  end  of  the  year.  In  2003,  a  magnitude  6.6  quake  struck  Iran’s  ancient  city  of 
Bam,  killing  over  30,000  people.  In  2004,  the  deadly  quake  was  a  magnitude  9 
earthquake that initiated 20 miles below the seafloor off the western coast of Suma-
tra,  the  fourth  largest  earthquake  to  strike  the  planet  since  1900  and  the  largest 
since  a  magnitude  9.2  earthquake  struck  Alaska  in  1964.  The  earthquake  and  re-
sulting  tsunami  killed  more  than  150,000  people  around  the  Indian  Ocean,  two-
thirds of them in northern Sumatra, whose inhabitants experienced not only the se-
vere shaking from the earthquake but also the tsunami’s full force. 

As  with  other  giant  earthquakes,  this  one  took  place  along  a  subduction  zone, 
where one of the tectonic plates that make up the Earth’s rigid outer layer is being 
thrust  beneath  another  (see  Figure  1).  The  Sunda  trench  is  the  seafloor  expression 
of  such  a  plate  boundary  where  the  Indian  plate  is  thrusting  under  the  overriding 
Burma  plate.  The  size  of  an  earthquake  is  directly  related  to  the  area  of  the  fault 
that is ruptured. This rupture propagated northward along the plate boundary fault 
for over 750 miles beneath the Nicobar and Andaman Islands almost to Burma with 
a  width  of  over  100  miles  and  slip  along  the  fault  averaging  several  tens  of  feet. 
It  is  difficult  to  comprehend  the  scope  of  a  magnitude  9  earthquake.  When  we 
hear the term earthquake magnitude, we think of the Richter scale, which was the 
first  of  several  scales  developed  to  measure  the  earthquake  size  from  the  seismic 
waves  they  generate.  These  scales  are  logarithmic  such  that  each  whole  number 
represents an order of magnitude larger in the seismic waves generated. So a mag-
nitude  7  earthquake  is  10  times  larger  than  a  magnitude  6  and  100  times  larger 
than  a  magnitude  5.  However,  the  amount  of  energy  released  goes  up  much  faster. 
This  magnitude  9  earthquake  released  32  times  more  energy  than  a  magnitude  8 
earthquake  and  1000  times  more  energy  than  a  magnitude  7  earthquake  such  as 
the  one  that  struck  the  San  Francisco  Bay  area  in  1989.  The  energy  released  by 
the  Sumatra  earthquake  is  roughly  equal  to  that  released  by  all  the  earthquakes, 
of every size, everywhere in the world since the mid-1990s. It’s important to remem-
ber  that  our  own  coasts,  Alaska  in  1964  and  the  Pacific  Northwest  in  1700,  were 
the site of earthquakes as large as the Sumatra earthquake. 

A great deal of that energy was transferred to the Indian Ocean’s waters and ulti-
mately to its surrounding shores. Along the length of the fault rupture, the seafloor 
was  jolted  upward  by  as  much  as  15  feet,  lifting  trillions  of  gallons  of  sea  water—
a volume more than 30 times that of the Great Salt Lake—and generating the tsu-
nami  that  swept  both  east,  inundating  the  coast  of  Sumatra,  Thailand  and  Burma, 
and  west,  crossing  the  open  ocean  at  hundreds  of  miles  per  hour  on  its  way  to  the 
coasts of India, Sri Lanka, and eventually eastern Africa. 

Tsunamis  strike  the  Indian  Ocean  less  frequently  than  the  Pacific  Ocean,  which 
is  ringed  by  subduction  zones,  but  there  have  been  at  least  a  half  dozen  Indian

Ocean  tsunamis  caused  by  earthquakes  in  the  past  200  years.  What  had  been  the 
deadliest tsunami in the region was not caused by an earthquake but by the explo-
sion  of  Krakatau  volcano  in  1883.  The  tsunami  generated  by  the  collapse  of  that 
volcano killed 36,000 people on Java, Sumatra and neighboring islands. 

It  is  important  to  emphasize  that  not  all  large  subsea  earthquakes  generate 
tsunamis.  For  example,  four  days  before  the  Sumatra  earthquake,  a  magnitude  8.1 
earthquake  struck  the  seafloor  south  of  New  Zealand  near  the  Macquarie  Islands. 
Instead  of  generating  a  thrusting  motion  as  in  a  subduction  zone,  this  earthquake 
occurred  on  a  strike-slip  fault,  moving  side  to  side  like  the  San  Andreas  Fault,  a 
motion  much  less  efficient  at  creating  a  tsunami.  No  tsunami  was  generated.  Even 
earthquakes generated in subduction zones may not produce tsunami, depending on 
whether  the  fault  rupture  reaches  the  seafloor,  the  amount  of  displacement  on  the 
fault  and  other  factors.  One  of  the  key  roles  of  a  tsunami  detection  system  is  to 
avoid false warnings that cause costly and unnecessary evacuations that can under-
mine  people’s  willingness  to  heed  warnings  in  the  future.  In  addition  to  buoys  and 
tide  gauges,  seismic  data  may  be  able  to  provide  an  additional  check,  and  research 
in  this  area  could  improve  our  ability  to  recognize  tsunami-causing  events  in  min-
utes. 
U.S. Earthquake Monitoring Networks and Their Role in Tsunami Warning 

Center Operations 

To monitor earthquakes in the United States, the USGS has begun to install and 
operate  the  Advanced  National  Seismic  System  (ANSS),  which  was  established  by 
the  National  Earthquake  Hazard  Reduction  Program  (NEHRP)  in  2000  (Pub.  L. 
106–503).  The  system  includes  a  63-station  ANSS  Backbone  Network,  which  is  ca-
pable  of  locating  most  felt  earthquakes  nationwide  and  provides  data  in  near-real-
time to USGS. Extending our capability in high-hazard areas of the country are 17 
regional  seismic  networks  that  provide  detailed  coverage  and  rapid  response,  local 
expertise  in  event  analysis  and  interpretation,  and  data.  Our  ANSS  partnerships—
which  include  universities,  state  government  agencies  and  NSF—greatly  leverage 
USGS seismic monitoring capabilities. The key products of the system are rapid and 
accurate earthquake locations and magnitudes, delivered directly to users for emer-
gency response. 

In  several  of  the  highest-risk  urban  areas  in  the  United  States,  dense  arrays  of 
seismic  sensors  designed  to  record  strong  ground  motion  have  been  deployed  under 
ANSS. These areas include the Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Anchorage and 
Salt  Lake  City  metropolitan  regions.  When  triggered  by  an  earthquake,  data  from 
these  sensors  are  automatically  processed  into  detailed  maps  of  ground  shaking 
(‘‘ShakeMaps’’),  which  in  turn  feed  loss  estimation  and  emergency  response.  Also, 
because earthquake losses are closely tied to the vulnerability of buildings and other 
structures, USGS monitors earthquake shaking in structures in support of engineer-
ing  research,  performance-based  design,  and  rapid  post-earthquake  damage  evalua-
tions.  If  placed  in  certain  critical  facilities,  these  sensors  can  contribute  to  critical 
post-earthquake response decisions. 

USGS  has  set  a  minimum  performance  goal  of  determining  automated  locations 
and  seismic  magnitudes  within  4  minutes  or  less  in  the  U.S.  This  is  exceeded  in 
many ANSS regions; for example, the magnitude 6.5 San Simeon, California, earth-
quake of December, 2003, was automatically located within 30 seconds. Earthquake 
data, including locations, magnitudes, other characterizations and, where requested, 
the  actual  seismograms,  are  automatically  transmitted  from  USGS  and  regional 
centers  to  federal  response  departments  and  agencies  such  as  the  NOAA  tsunami 
warning  centers,  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security,  including  the  Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), state governments, local emergency man-
agers,  utility  operators,  several  private  sector  entities,  and  the  public  and  media. 
USGS  does  not  currently  have  24 ×  7  earthquake  analysis,  but  analysts  are  on-call 
in the event of a large earthquake worldwide. The Administration has recently pro-
posed  24  ×  7  operations  as  a  key  needed  improvement  in  response  to  the  Indian 
Ocean tsunami disaster. 

To  monitor  seismic  events  worldwide,  the  Global  Seismographic  Network  (GSN) 
maintains a constellation of 128 globally distributed, modern seismic sensors. USGS 
operates  about  two-thirds  of  this  network,  and  the  University  of  California,  San 
Diego,  operates  the  other  third  with  NSF  support.  NSF  also  funds  the  IRIS  (Incor-
porated  Research  Institutions  for  Seismology)  Consortium  to  handle  data  manage-
ment and long-term archiving. Two GSN stations were the first to detect the Decem-
ber 26, 2004, Sumatra earthquake, and automated analysis of these data generated 
the ‘‘alerts’’ of strong recorded amplitudes sent to NOAA and USGS. At the present 
time,  about  80  percent  of  GSN  stations  transmit  real-time  data  that  can  be  used 
for rapid earthquake analysis and tsunami warning. The Administration is request-

ing  funding  to  extend  the  GSN’s  real-time  data  communications,  as  well  as  to  im-
prove station uptime through more frequent maintenance. These changes will result 
in improved tsunami warning in the United States and globally. 

Through  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program,  the  USGS,  NOAA, 
FEMA,  and  five  western  States  (Alaska,  California,  Hawaii,  Oregon  and  Wash-
ington)  have  worked  to  enhance  the  quality  and  quantity  of  seismic  data  provided 
to  the  NOAA  tsunami  warning  centers  and  how  this  data  is  used  at  the  state  and 
local  level.  This  program  has  funded  USGS  to  upgrade  seismic  equipment  for  re-
gional  seismic  networks  in  Northern  California,  Oregon,  Washington,  Alaska  and 
Hawaii. The seismic data recorded by the USGS nationally and globally are relayed 
to the NOAA tsunami warning centers. USGS and NOAA also exchange earthquake 
locations  and  magnitude  estimates,  with  USGS  providing  the  final  authoritative 
magnitudes  of  events.  USGS  is  also  working  with  emergency  managers  in  the  Pa-
cific Northwest to support public warning systems in coastal communities there. 

Improving  earthquake  monitoring  in  the  United  States—with  consequent  im-
provements to public safety and the reduction of earthquake losses—can be achieved 
through the modernization and expansion of the ANSS, including expansion of seis-
mic  sensor  networks  nationwide,  the  upgrading  of  the  associated  data  processing 
and  analysis  facilities,  and  the  development  of  new  earthquake  products.  Funding 
over the past three years has focused on installation of over 500 new seismic sensors 
in  high-risk  urban  areas.  The  FY05  appropriation  for  ANSS  is  $5.12  million.  The 
President’s  proposed  increase  in  funding  to  USGS  in  response  to  the  tsunami  dis-
aster would allow USGS to make critically needed improvements to performance in 
one key element of ANSS, providing 24 × 7 operations capacity and completing soft-
ware  and  hardware  upgrades  to  speed  processing  times.  These  improvements  will 
enhance USGS support of NOAA’s tsunami warning responsibility. 
The Threat From Tsunamis and Great Earthquakes in the Pacific 

The concentration of U.S. tsunami warning efforts in the Pacific reflects the great-
er  frequency  of  destructive  tsunami  in  that  ocean.  Approximately  85  percent  of  the 
world’s tsunamis occur in the Pacific. This is due to many subduction zones ringing 
the  Pacific  basin—the  source  of  submarine  earthquakes  of  large  enough  magnitude 
(greater  than  ¢7)  to  produce  tsunami.  While  Hawaii’s  position  in  the  middle  of  the 
Pacific  makes  it  uniquely  vulnerable  to  ocean-wide  tsunami,  this  chain  of  volcanic 
islands also faces a hazard from locally generated tsunami due to local earthquakes 
or  submarine  landslides.  In  1975,  a  magnitude  7.2  earthquake  just  offshore  the  is-
land  of  Hawaii  caused  a  tsunami  that  killed  2  with  maximum  runup  height  (ele-
vation reached by tsunami as they move inland from the shoreline) of 47 feet. 

U.S. Insular Areas in the Pacific also face a threat both from ocean-wide tsunami 
as well as ones generated locally. The volcano Anatahan in the Northern Marianas, 
which began actively erupting on January 5, 2005, serves as a reminder that inhab-
itants  and  U.S.  military  interests  in  the  Commonwealth  of  the  Northern  Mariana 
Islands and the Territory of Guam are threatened by nine islands with active volca-
noes that have the potential to generate hazardous ash plumes as well as tsunamis 
through eruption-induced collapse. The risks from tsunamis to the inhabited islands 
are  poorly  understood,  and  tsunami  inundation  modeling  is  needed  to  assess  the 
threat represented by such an event. 

Our  knowledge  of  what  may  be  the  greatest  risk  to  the  United  States  does  not 
come from our tsunami experiences of the last half century, but rather to the detec-
tive  work  of  USGS  and  other  scientists  in  the  Pacific  Northwest.  In  contrast  to  the 
San  Andreas  Fault,  where  the  Pacific  and  North  American  plates  are  sliding  past 
one  another,  a  subduction  zone  known  as  Cascadia  lies  offshore  further  north,  its 
size nearly identical to that of the rupture zone of the Sumatra earthquake (see Fig-
ure  2).  On  January  26,  1700,  the  Cascadia  subduction  zone  broke  in  a  great  earth-
quake,  probably  from  northernmost  California  to  the  middle  of  Vancouver  Island. 
Along  the  Pacific  coast  in  Oregon,  Washington,  California,  and  British  Columbia, 
this huge event of the same general size of the Sumatra earthquake, caused coastal 
marshes  to  suddenly  drop  down  several  feet.  This  change  in  land  elevation  was  re-
corded  by  the  vegetation  living  in  and  around  the  coastal  marshes.  For  example, 
along  the  Copalis  River  in  Washington  State,  Western  Red  Cedar  trees  that  have 
lifespans  of  over  1000  years  were  suddenly  submerged  in  salt  water.  Over  the  next 
few  months,  those  trees  died.  By  comparing  tree  rings  of  the  still  standing  dead 
trees  with  nearby  trees  that  were  not  submerged,  paleoseismologists  established 
that the trees were killed during the winter of 1699–1700. 

Digging  through  river  bank  deposits  along  the  Copalis  and  other  rivers  in 
Cascadia,  paleoseismologists  found  a  pervasive,  black  sand  sheet  left  by  the  tsu-
nami.  Because  the  sands  deposited  by  the  tsunami  are  transported  by  the  tsunami 
waves,  paleoseismologists  can  combine  the  location  of  tsunami  sands  with  the

change  in  marsh  elevation  to  get  an  approximate  idea  of  the  length  of  the  rupture 
for  the  1700  earthquake.  Tsunami  sands  have  been  found  from  Vancouver  Island 
to Humboldt Bay in California. 

Once  paleoseismologists  found  evidence  of  the  1700  event,  they  combed  written 
records  in  Japan  to  see  if  evidence  existed  of  an  unknown  tsunami  wave.  Several 
villages  recorded  damage  in  Japan  on  January  27,  1700,  from  a  wave  that  people 
living  along  the  coast  could  not  associate  with  strong  ground  shaking.  The  coast  of 
Japan  had  been  hit,  not  unlike  Sri  Lanka  and  Somalia,  by  a  distant  tsunami,  but 
this  tsunami  came  from  the  west  coast  of  North  America.  By  modeling  the  travel 
time  across  the  Pacific,  paleoseismologists  were  able  to  establish  the  exact  date  of 
the last Cascadia subduction zone event. 

Based  on  estimates  of  the  return  interval,  USGS  scientists  and  others  have  esti-
mated  that  there  is  a  10–14  percent  chance  of  a  repeat  of  the  Cascadia  magnitude 
9  earthquake  and  tsunami  event  in  the  next  50  years.  Since  that  initial  discovery 
in  the  early  1980s,  many  of  the  elements  of  the  seismic  systems  for  the  Pacific 
Northwest  described  above  have  been  put  in  place  along  with  improved  building 
codes to address the higher expected ground shaking and increased public education 
through the efforts of state and local emergency managers. 

The  December  26,  2004,  earthquake  and  tsunami  together  cause  us  to  focus  on 
the  similar  threat  from  the  Cascadia  subduction  zone  that  faces  the  Pacific  North-
west  as  well  as  our  long  Alaskan  coastline.  Here  I  cannot  emphasize  enough  the 
critical  role  played  by  our  partners  in  state  and  local  government,  especially  the 
state  emergency  managers.  Largely  through  the  efforts  of  the  National  Tsunami 
Hazard Mitigation Program partnership, much has been accomplished. Seismic sys-
tems have been improved, allowing NOAA’s West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warn-
ing  Center  to  issue  warnings  within  minutes  of  a  significant  offshore  earthquake. 
Inundation maps, graphic representations of estimates of how far inland future tsu-
nami waves are likely to reach, are available for most major communities in north-
ern California, Oregon, and Washington. Working with FEMA, public education has 
been  stressed,  and  emergency  managers  have  begun  installing  all-hazard  warning 
systems. USGS is co-funding a $540,000 pilot project in Seaside, Oregon with FEMA 
and NOAA to develop risk identification products that will help communities under-
stand  their  actual  level  of  risk  from  tsunami  in  a  way  that  could  be  conveyed  on 
existing flood maps. The goal of the project is to develop techniques that can be used 
to determine the probability and magnitude of tsunami in other communities along 
the west coast of the United States. 
Tsunami Threats in the Atlantic 

With  respect  to  tsunami  hazard  risk  to  the  U.S.  East  coast,  it  should  be  noted 
that  subduction  zones  are  scarce  in  the  Atlantic  Ocean.  But  the  Atlantic  Ocean  is 
not  immune  to  tsunami.  A  tsunami  following  the  great  1755  Lisbon  earthquake, 
generated by collision of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates, devastated coasts 
of  Portugal  and  Morocco,  reached  the  British  Isles,  and  crested  as  much  as  20  feet 
high in the Caribbean. 

In 1929, the magnitude 7.2 Grand Banks earthquake triggered a submarine land-
slide and tsunami that struck Newfoundland’s sparsely settled coast, where it killed 
27  people  with  waves  as  high  as  20  feet.  An  event  like  this,  involving  a  submarine 
landslide, may be the most likely scenario for the Atlantic coast. Scars of past large 
submarine landslides abound on the continental slope off the U.S. Atlantic coast. As 
in  the  1929  Grand  Banks  event,  some  of  the  slides  probably  resulted  from  large 
earthquakes. If earthquakes are the primary initiator of the observed landslide fea-
tures,  the  hazard  to  the  Atlantic  coast  is  limited  as  large  earthquakes  rarely  occur 
in  the  vicinity  of  the  U.S.  and  Canada  Atlantic  coast—perhaps  once  a  century,  on 
average  (Boston  area,  1755;  Charleston,  1866;  Newfoundland,  1929).  Additionally, 
this  type  of  tsunami  would  affect  a  much  smaller  geographical  area  than  one  gen-
erated  by  a  subduction  zone,  and  its  flooding  effect  and  inundation  distance  would 
be  limited.  Much  work  is  needed,  however,  to  more  fully  understand  the  triggering 
of submarine landslides and the extent of that threat in the Atlantic. 

Another  tsunami  scenario  for  the  Atlantic  coast  that  has  been  widely  publicized 
is  a  landslide  involving  collapse  of  part  of  the  Cumbre  Vieja  volcano  in  the  Canary 
Islands into the sea. While this collapse would be dramatic and might indeed induce 
a  transatlantic  tsunami,  such  a  collapse  may  occur  only  once  every  hundred  thou-
sand  years.  Furthermore,  unlike  the  West  Coast  with  the  abundant  record  of  past 
ocean-wide tsunami deposits, no such regionally extensive deposits have been found 
to date along the Atlantic coast.

Tsunami Threats in the Caribbean 

37

The Caribbean is subject to a broad range of geologic processes that have the po-
tential  to  generate  tsunami.  Indeed,  the  Caribbean  tectonic  plate  has  almost  all  of 
the  tsunami-generating  sources  within  a  small  geographical  area.  Subduction  zone 
earthquakes  of  the  type  that  generated  the  Indian  Ocean  tsunami  are  found  along 
the Lesser Antilles and the Hispaniola and Puerto Rico trenches. Other moderately 
large earthquakes due to more local tectonic activity take place probably once a cen-
tury, such as in Mona Passage (1918 tsunami) and in the Virgin Islands basin (1867 
tsunami).  Moderate  earthquakes  occur  that  may  trigger  undersea  landslides  and 
thus  generate  tsunami.  An  active  underwater  volcano  (Kick’em  Jenny  near  Gre-
nada)  where  sea  floor  maps  show  previous  episodes  of  flank  collapse  also  poses  a 
tsunami  hazard.  Above-water  volcanic  activity  occurs,  wherein  the  Lesser  Antilles 
periodically generate landslides that enter the sea to cause tsunami. And finally, the 
possibility exists of tele-tsunami from the African-Eurasian plate boundary, such as 
the great Lisbon earthquake of 1755 described above. 

In  1867,  an  18-foot  high  tsunami  wave  entered  St.  Thomas’  Charlotte  Amalie  at 
the  same  time  that  a  27-foot  wave  entered  St.  Croix’s  Christiansted  Harbor.  Were 
that  to  occur  again  today,  the  10-fold  increase  in  population  density,  the  cruise 
ships,  petroleum  carriers,  harbor  infrastructure,  hotels  and  beach  goers,  nearby 
power plants, petrochemical complexes, marinas, condominiums, and schools, would 
all be at risk. 

On  October  11,  1918,  the  island  of  Puerto  Rico  was  struck  by  a  magnitude  7.5 
earthquake,  centered  approximately  15  kilometers  off  the  island’s  northwestern 
coast,  in  the  Mona  Passage.  In  addition  to  causing  widespread  destruction  across 
Puerto  Rico,  the  quake  generated  a  medium  sized  tsunami  that  produced  runup  as 
high  as  18  feet  along  the  western  coast  of  the  island  and  killed  40  people,  in  addi-
tion to the 76 people killed by the earthquake. More than 1,600 people were report-
edly killed along the northern coast of the Dominican Republic in 1946 by a tsunami 
triggered by a magnitude 8.1 earthquake. 

In contrast to the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico has low tsunami risk. The region 
is  seismically  quiet  and  protected  from  tsunami  generated  in  either  the  Atlantic  or 
the Caribbean by Florida, Cuba, and broad continental shelves. Although there have 
been  hurricane-generated  subsea  landslides  as  recently  as  this  fall,  there  is  no  evi-
dence that they have generated significant tsunami. 
Lessons  Learned:  What  the  United  States  Can  Do  to  Better  Prepare  Itself 

and the World 

Natural  hazard  events  such  as  the  one  that  struck  Sumatra  and  the  countries 
around  the  Indian  Ocean  on  December  26,  2004,  are  geologically  inevitable,  but 
their consequences are not. The tsunami is a potent reminder that while the nations 
surrounding  the  Pacific  Ocean  face  the  highest  tsunami  hazard,  countries  around 
other ocean basins lacking basic tsunami warning systems and mitigation strategies 
face  considerable  risk.  Reducing  that  risk  requires  a  broad,  comprehensive  system 
including  rapid  global  earthquake  and  tsunami  detection  systems,  transmission  of 
warnings  in  standardized  formats  to  emergency  officials  who  already  know  which 
coastal  areas  are  vulnerable  through  inundation  mapping  and  tsunami  hazard  as-
sessment, and broadcast capabilities to reach a public already educated in the dan-
gers and how to respond. For tsunami crossing an ocean basin, an adequate system 
of  earthquake  sensors,  Deep-ocean  Assessment  and  Reporting  of  Tsunamis  (DART) 
buoys,  and  tide  gauges  should  allow  for  timely  warnings  if  the  rest  of  the  system 
is in place. For tsunami generated near the coastline, time is considerably more crit-
ical. For tsunami warnings to be effective, they must be generated and transmitted 
to the affected coastline within a few minutes of detection, local emergency respond-
ers must be prepared, the population must be informed, and the entire system must 
be executed without delay. 

The Sumatra earthquake and its devastating effects will encourage us to continue 
forward  on  the  comprehensive  NEHRP  approach  to  earthquake  loss  reduction. 
USGS  is  committed  to  do  so  in  partnership  with  FEMA,  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology, and NSF to translate research into results through such 
initiatives as ANSS, the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering 
Simulation,  the  plan  to  accelerate  the  use  of  new  earthquake  risk  mitigation  tech-
nologies, and development of improved seismic provisions in building codes. 

As  part  of  the  President’s  plan  to  improve  tsunami  detection  and  warning  sys-

tems, the USGS will:

• Implement  24  ×  7  operations  at  the  National  Earthquake  Information  Center 
and upgrade hardware and software systems in order to improve the timeliness 
of alerts for global earthquakes. As part of the upgrade, USGS will fully develop

what  is  now  a  prototype  system  to  estimate  the  number  of  people  affected  by 
strong  ground  shaking  after  an  earthquake  using  our  ShakeMap  model  and 
databases  of  global  population.  Known  as  Prompt  Assessment  of  Global  Earth-
quakes for Response (PAGER), this system can provide aid agencies and others 
with a quick estimate of how significant the casualties might be well in advance 
of reports from affected areas where communications may be down.

• Support research to develop more rapid methods for characterizing earthquakes 

and discriminating likely tsunamigenic sources.

• Improve  the  detection  response  time  of  the  Global  Seismographic  Network  by 
making data from all stations available in real time via satellite telemetry and 
improving  station  up-time  through  increased  maintenance  schedules.  Improved 
coverage  in  the  Caribbean  region  will  be  achieved  through  the  addition  of  sta-
tions  and  upgrades  of  existing  stations  through  international  partnerships  and 
cooperation.

• Further the use of software developed by the California Integrated Seismic Net-
work  (a  USGS,  university  and  state  partnership)  to  speed  USGS-generated 
earthquake  information  directly  to  local  emergency  managers  with  a  dual  use 
capability to also provide NOAA tsunami warnings.

• Enhance existing USGS geologic and elevation mapping for coastal areas in the 
Caribbean.  Such  mapping  is  critical  to  development  of  improved  tsunami  haz-
ards assessments for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The  USGS  will  also  continue  its  ongoing  efforts  to  improve  tsunami  hazard  as-
sessment  and  warnings  through  geologic  investigations  into  the  history  of  and  po-
tential for tsunami occurrence; coastal and marine mapping; modeling tsunami gen-
eration,  source  characterization,  and  propagation;  and  development  of  assessment 
methods and products such as inundation maps with NOAA, FEMA, and other part-
ners.  USGS  will  also  continue  strong  partnerships  with  state  tsunami  and  earth-
quake  hazard  mitigation  groups  and  contribute  to  public  awareness  efforts.  An  ex-
ample  of  the  latter  is  the  2001  publication,  USGS  Circular  1187,  Surviving  a  Tsu-
nami:  Lessons  Learned  from  Chile,  Hawaii  and  Japan,  which  was  prepared  in  co-
operation with the Universidad Austral de Chile, University of Tokyo, University of 
Washington,  Geological  Survey  of  Japan,  and  the  Pacific  Tsunami  Museum.  Con-
tinuing investigations of the Indian Ocean tsunami provide a critical opportunity to 
expand  our  knowledge  of  tsunami  generation  and  impacts  and  to  evaluate  the  re-
search and operational requirements for effective hazard planning, warning, and re-
sponse systems. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  appear  before  the  Committee 

and would be happy to answer any questions now or for the record.

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
We  have  just  created  a  new  Subcommittee  on  Disaster  Preven-
tion  and  Prediction.  We  hope  that  that  Subcommittee  will  keep 
your  two  agencies  pretty  busy,  because  we  think  we  have  to  find 
some way to make this a more robust system.

Let  me  ask  you,  Dr.  Marburger,  what’s  the  timeline  for  the  Ad-
ministration’s  improved  Tsunami  Detection  and  Warning  System? 
Can  you  tell  us  the  timeline,  how  soon  are  you  going  to  move  into 
it?  As  I  understand  it,  we’re  going  to  finish  the  one  we’ve  already 
got  going,  but  there’s  a  tremendous  expansion  of  it.  How  long  is  it 
going to take us to do that? 

Dr.  MARBURGER.  That’s  correct.  The  agencies  indicate  to  us  that 
they ought to be able to have substantial improvement of the exist-
ing  system  within  2  years,  at  the  end  of  2  years,  if  I’m  not  mis-
taken. Fortunately, all the technology is available. The systems are 
up  and  running,  and  it’s  improvements  and—improved  mainte-
nance  and  additional  deployment  of  things  like  these  new  buoys 
that’s  required.  So  it  should  be  doable  in  a  relatively  short  period 
of  time.  Mid–2007  are  the  dates  that  I’ve  heard.  They  can  be  con-
firmed by others. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  As  I  understand  it,  General  Kelly,  several  of 
these buoys are not working right now. The DART is on the surface 
of the ocean. They’re connected to a detector at the bottom. Tell us 
what  is  leading  to  the  malfunction  of  these  warning  devices  now? 

General KELLY. Many things. 
The CHAIRMAN. I can’t hear you, I’m sorry. 
General  KELLY.  Many  things.  And  you  are  correct,  there  are  six 
DART buoys sited in the water today. Three of the six are not oper-
ational. One has not been operational since October of 2003. There 
are  two  complicating  factors.  One  is  the  weather,  the  weather  in 
the  Aleutians,  there’s  a  narrow  window  when  we  can  get  boats  in 
there,  or  ships  in  there,  to  repair  them,  and  then,  two,  a  number 
of  components  have  failed,  different  components  have  failed  at  dif-
ferent  times.  And  so,  part  of  our  plan  is,  in  fact,  to  put  a  better 
buoy  in  place  of  the  existing  ones,  and  then  expand  the  network. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Could  you  put  that  chart  up  again,  showing 

where these new buoys are going to be——

General KELLY. Yes, sir. 
The  CHAIRMAN.—and  where  the  existing  ones  are?  As  I  under-
stand  it,  half  of  the  buoys  we’ve  detected—we’ve  deployed  right 
now are not functioning? 

General KELLY. That is correct. 
The CHAIRMAN. Which ones? 
General KELLY. (Indicating.) The red ones. 
The CHAIRMAN. Tell us, for the record. 
General KELLY. Three along the Aleutians. 
The CHAIRMAN. Three along the Aleutian chain. 
General KELLY. Yes. Yes, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. And what’s the plan for replacing those? 
General  KELLY.  Within  the  last—within  the  last  several  weeks, 
we—or last month—we attempted to repair one, got it in the water, 
and  then  a  component  malfunctioned.  And  we  are  ready  now,  as 
soon  as  we  get  a  break  in  the  weather—we  have  forward-deployed 
the parts into Alaska—as soon as we get a break in the weather—
and  we  need  about  7  days  of  good  weather—we’ll  get  a  ship  out 
there and replace the buoys. 

The CHAIRMAN. Whose job is it to maintain and assure that they 

are functioning? 

General KELLY. NOAA’s.

The CHAIRMAN. Which part of NOAA? 
General KELLY. The National Weather Service. 
The CHAIRMAN. Do they have the equipment to do that? 
General KELLY. Well, they certainly don’t own the ships to do it, 
and  they  use  the  NOAA  Corps  to  do  that,  or  we  contract  out.  But 
they have—we have a National Data Buoy Center in Bay St. Louis, 
which has the capability——

The CHAIRMAN. Where do you have it? 
General KELLY. Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. And——
The CHAIRMAN. The center’s in Mississippi, and all the buoys are 

in the Pacific? 

General KELLY. Well, no, sir, we have other kinds of buoys along 

the Gulf Coast and along the United—and along the——

The CHAIRMAN. We’re talking about tsunami warning now. 
General  KELLY.  Well,  yes,  sir,  but  we’re  also  talking  about  buoy 
technology.  And  they  have  engineers  and  they  have  scientists,  and 
they  work  closely  with  the  Pacific  Marine  Environmental  Lab.  So 
our operational and maintenance repair facility is in Bay St. Louis, 
Mississippi. 

The CHAIRMAN. How long have they been down, those three? 
General KELLY. One has been down since October 2003, one was 
down  in—one  went  down  in  December  2004,  and  another  went 
down in August 2004. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Is  there  a  specific  program  looking  at  the  reli-

ability of these buoys we’re going to deploy? 

General KELLY. Yes, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. Who’s in charge of that? 
General  KELLY.  We’re  working  jointly  with  the  Pacific  Marine 
Environmental  Lab  and  our  experts  at  the  National  Data  Buoy 
Center. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  All  right.  That  worries  me  a  great  deal.  If  we’re 
going to spend money expanding the system we’re going to put out 
there—the  buoys  have  been  failing  at  this  rate,  it,  sort  of,  looks  to 
me like the taxpayer may be just financing a facade. 

General  KELLY.  It  is  not  our  intent  to  put  a  one-for-one  replace-
ment  of  the  buoys  that  are  out  there  as  we  expand  this  network. 
We need to put out buoys that are more robust and survive longer. 
And,  in  fact,  given  the  challenges  that  we’ve  had  in—as  I  men-
tioned  earlier,  including—included  in  the  plan  will  be  three  buoys 
that I will call ‘‘in-water backups,’’ so, in case one does malfunction, 
we will still have something providing us data. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Dr.  Groat,  the  problem  of  these  earthquakes  and  prediction  and 
tying  them  into  this  system,  can  you  tell  us,  we  have  these  buoys 
deployed, but you’re not relying on those buoys for your predictions 
and detection of earthquakes, are you? 

Dr. GROAT. No, sir. We rely on the Global Seismic Network, local 
networks  that  are  subsidiary  to  it,  to  understand  the  earthquakes 
and the potential for generating a tsunami. Many earthquakes are 
very  large,  but  don’t  generate  tsunamis,  even  those  that  occur  in 
the  ocean.  The  key  is  getting  that  earthquake  interpretation  to 
NOAA  in  a  timely  fashion  so  that  if  it’s  likely  to  have  generated 
a tsunami, then they can be prepared to use that information.

The  CHAIRMAN.  Is  there  a  way  to  tie  together  what  you’ve  got 
and  the  other  systems  here  to  make  a  prediction  telling  us  if  an 
earthquake  occurs  at  any  particular  place,  there  will  or  not  be  a 
tsunami? We seem to only get tsunamis as a reaction to the earth-
quakes, mainly in the Pacific, right? 

Dr. GROAT. Correct. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  So  are  we  tied  together—can  we  say,  if  there’s 
an  earthquake  at  such-and-such  a  place  on  the  Aleutian  chain, 
there probably would be a tsunami that would go any particular di-
rection? 

Dr.  GROAT.  With  the  upgrades  that  we’ve  talked  about  in  our 
seismic  monitoring  system  and  the  data  processing,  we  will  do  a 
better job of predicting whether the earthquake was of a type that 
would  generate  a  tsunami.  There  are  many  large  displacements 
that go this way, and they don’t generate anything. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  OK.  But  if  you  can  predict  there’s  going  to  be  a 

tsunami, can you predict where it’s going to go? 

Dr.  GROAT.  Well,  they  go—it’s,  sort  of,  like  dropping  a  rock  in  a 
pond,  the  waves  go  in  all  directions.  So  once  we  know  where  it  is, 
then  we  can  watch  where  the  waves  will  go.  And  we  can  predict 
that pretty well. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you.  That’s  what  I  was  looking  for.  I 
watched  the  Discovery  channel  the  other  night.  You  all  did  a  very 
good job on that, and I did not know that until then, that it is like 
dropping  a  stone  in  a  pond.  There  will  be  tsunamis  everywhere  if 
it’s  located,  say,  around  Senator  Inouye’s  country,  it’s  possible  it 
could affect the whole Pacific, right? 

Dr. GROAT. Very much so. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Inouye? 
Senator INOUYE. Like most of my colleagues, I’m concerned about 
the  six  DART  buoys.  Three  have  been  out  of  commission  for  about 
15 months. And if it weren’t for the tragedy of biblical proportions, 
the  likelihood  is  that  this  Congress  would  not  have  been  notified. 
Am I correct? 

General KELLY. Yes, sir. 
Senator  INOUYE.  We  would  not  have  known  that  three  were  out 

of commission. 

General  KELLY.  You’re  correct.  But  I  would  point  out  that  the 
DART  buoys,  while  important,  are  not  the  only  components  in  the 
network. 

Senator  INOUYE.  I  realize  that  there  are  many  circumstances 
that  would  cause  problems,  such  as  weather  and  the  budget.  Why 
was it impossible for NOAA to notify the Congress that three of the 
six were out of business? 

General  KELLY.  Senator,  within  NOAA,  there  are  a  number  of 
observing  systems  out  there.  And,  as  a  matter  of  practice,  we  rou-
tinely  don’t  notify  the  Congress  when  a  given  sensor,  or  a  series 
of sensors, goes out. 

Senator  INOUYE.  You  don’t  know  whether  the  system  is  working 

General KELLY. Well, no. We know, but we don’t routinely notify 
the  Congress.  We  sometimes  have  problems  with  satellites,  with  a 
given sensor on a satellite, and, at least in my experience, we have 
not routinely provided an update to the Congress of a problem with 

or not?

a  satellite  sensor.  We  try  to  work  through  it,  and,  in  most  cases, 
get it resolved. 

The CHAIRMAN. Would the Senator yield just there? 
Senator INOUYE. Sure. 
The CHAIRMAN. Who do you notify when a buoy goes down? 
General  KELLY.  When  a  buoy  goes  down,  the  head  of  the  Na-
tional  Weather  Service  gets  notified,  the  two  Tsunami  Warning 
Center directors get notified, and it is the responsibility of the head 
of the National Weather Service to get those buoys repaired. 
The CHAIRMAN. So they don’t tell your Governor, or mine. 
Senator INOUYE. These buoys are obviously very important. They 
not only prevent the loss of lives, they prevent the unnecessary ex-
penditure of funds. I’m just thinking to myself, if that disaster that 
we experienced in Indonesia and Sri Lanka had occurred in Wash-
ington  or  Oregon  or  Alaska,  and  we  weren’t  warned  because  the 
three  buoys  were  not  operational,  the  atmosphere  in  this  room 
would be, I think, much more heated. 

General  KELLY.  I  agree  with  you,  Senator  Inouye,  but  I  believe 
that,  while  the  three  buoys  are  important,  we  still  have  the  capa-
bility  to  warn.  And  even  if  that  earthquake  had  occurred  some-
where  in  the  Pacific,  warnings  would  have  gone  out.  Because  even 
with  the  three  buoys  being  down,  the  Pacific  Tsunami  Warning 
Center  did  issue  a—what  we  call  an  information  advisory  that  a 
tsunami had, in fact, been generated. So, while the three are down, 
and that’s regrettable, and we’re working to get them repaired, we 
are not totally defenseless because those three are down. And I am 
not  trying  to  condone  the  fact  that  they  are  down,  or  they’ve  been 
down as long as they have, but I think it is important that we don’t 
leave here thinking that we are totally defenseless in providing in-
formation  and  warnings.  And  you  are  correct  that  one  of  the  great 
benefits  of  those  DART  buoys  are,  it  gives  confirmation  as  to  the 
characterization  and  the  magnitude  of  the  tsunami,  and,  in  fact, 
helps  reduce  the  number  of  what  we  call  false  alarms,  and  then 
saves  the  local  governments  money,  in  terms  of  responding.  And, 
frankly,  most  importantly,  a  whole  string  of  false-alarm  tsunami 
warnings will cause the citizens not to pay attention to it, and that 
is a critical thing we need to work against. 

Senator  INOUYE.  By  indicating  your  position,  you’re  not  sug-

gesting we don’t need any more DART buoys. 

General  KELLY.  No,  sir,  I  am  not  indicating  we  don’t  need  any 
more  DART  buoys.  They  will  improve  the  system.  I  am  trying  to 
get the message across that we are not totally defenseless with the 
existing  systems,  and  the  citizens  of  Hawaii  and  the  citizens  of 
Alaska  and  the  West  Coast  of  the  United  States  ought  not  to  get 
unduly alarmed. 

Senator  INOUYE.  I  have  just  one  more  question,  to  any  one  of 
you.  Within  24  hours  after  the  disaster  in  Southeast  Asia,  major 
stations,  such  as  CNN  and  all  of  the  networks  began  criticizing, 
and  suggesting  that  they  should  have  been  notified  so  that  they 
could  have  used  their  offices  and  facilities  to  warn  the  people.  Is 
that a valid criticism? Could that have been done? 

Dr. MARBURGER. Well, it certainly could have been done. I do not 
know  what  the  protocol  is  for  notifications,  but  the  National

45

Weather Service is notified instantly, and usually their information 
is shared immediately with the media. 

General  KELLY.  Senator  Inouye,  it  is  my  belief  that  many  of 
those news organizations did, in fact, get the tsunami bulletin that 
was  sent  out  from  the  Hagemayer  Warning  Center  in  Hawaii.  I 
think  what  they  were  asking  for  was  some  type  of  protocol  being 
established  wherein  the  watch  officer  might  make  a  telephone  call 
to them or somehow take an explicit step to get the information to 
them. 

Senator INOUYE. Is that a valid request? 
General  KELLY.  I  think  we  have  to  do  some  analysis  of  it  and 
what we are talking about. Now, let’s take the National Hurricane 
Center.  When  hurricanes  are  coming,  there  is  a  large  press  pres-
ence  in  the  Hurricane  Center.  Fortunately,  with  hurricanes,  we 
have a bit more time to start alerting the public. With tsunamis—
and while this earthquake, as Dr. Groat said, was one of the more 
massive in the century, I mean, we had time to watch the tsunami 
perpetuate  across  the  Pacific.  Frequently,  in  Alaska  and  Hawaii 
you only have minutes, and I’m just not sure, given one watch offi-
cer trying to issue bulletins, clarify the bulletins, that there’s suffi-
cient  time  for  him  to  be  talking  to  the  press.  There  may  be  other 
arrangements that can be made with the press for them to get the 
information differently. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  There  was  another  criticism,  in  that  we  did  no-
tify  the  countries  involved,  but  the  receiving  facility  was  not  oper-
ational. Is that a valid one? 

General KELLY. When you’re talking about the ‘‘receiving,’’ you’re 

talking about the receiving system in the in-country? 

Senator INOUYE. Yes. 
General  KELLY.  As  I  said  in  my  testimony,  we  have  an  agree-
ment  with  26  countries  in  the  Pacific  Rim  to  provide  information 
to  them,  and  then  they  have  the  responsibility  of  developing  their 
local warnings and distributing them to their country. No such sys-
tem  exists  in  the  Pacific  Ocean,  so  I—I’m  sorry,  in  the  Indian 
Ocean—and  so,  that  is—there’s  some  truth  in  that,  that  countries 
were not prepared to deal with it. 

As  I  said  in  my  testimony,  tsunami  preparedness  has  a  number 
of variables in it. To my mind, the most important one is, when you 
get  the  warning,  have  you  got  a  way,  internally,  to  get  it  out  to 
your  citizens,  and  have  you  educated  them  and  worked  with  them 
so  that  they  know  what  to  do?  Thanks  to  both  of  your  help  with 
the  Tsunami  Mitigation  Program  legislation  in  1996,  we’ve  been 
able  to  do  a  fair  amount  of  that  work  on  the  West  Coast  and  in 
Hawaii. 

Senator INOUYE. Thank you very much. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Gentlemen,  if  necessary,  Senator  Inouye  and  I 
will send you a letter, to each of your agencies, for this request. We 
would  ask  that  you  report  back  to  us,  in  2  weeks,  what  it  would 
take  to  establish  a  system  to  notify  the  entities  who  have  been 
mentioned—specifically,  911,  the  Weather  Channel,  the  emergency 
disaster systems that exist in the 50 states. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  We’re  concerned  primarily  with  this  country  be-
cause  of  our  Committee’s  jurisdiction.  I’m  sure  others  will  be  ask-

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  13:59 Nov 17, 2005 Jkt 022845 PO 00000 Frm 00049 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\22845.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

ing  the  question  about  the  international  aspects  of  the  system  to 
come. But, right now, we thought we had a system, and we found, 
when  this  occurred,  that  it  was—half  of  it  was  dormant,  was  not 
working.  And  we  think  we  ought  to  have  a  system  that  not  only—
we’re  notified  if  something’s  gone  wrong,  but  we  also  have  ade-
quate apparatus to detect the problem and get at it now. 

And,  beyond  that,  though,  I  think  that  the  news  media  have  a 
legitimate cause to object. There’s no reason why we can’t have an 
interconnection with 911 or with the Weather Channel or with the 
disaster  system  or  with  FEMA.  That  can—we  also  handle  commu-
nications, gentlemen, and that can be done automatically. Once you 
press  the  button,  it  can  be  very  ubiquitous  and  go  throughout  the 
country, if it’s set up right. 

So  we’d  like  to  know,  What  will  it  take  to  do  that?  And  if  you 
need  money,  the  appropriations  bills  are  coming  up,  we’ll  see  to  it 
you’ll get it. 

General  KELLY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  may  have  misunderstood  your 
question.  I  thought,  when  you  were  talking  about  the  press,  you 
were  talking  about  internationally.  We  work—we,  in  NOAA,  work 
very,  very  closely  with  the  Weather  Channel.  We  work  very,  very 
closely with FEMA. We will provide the information you requested. 
I  will  be  surprised,  in  fact,  if  those  organizations  you  talked  about 
did not have information about this tsunami. The fact was, though, 
that  the  tsunami  was  not  going  to  impact  the  United  States,  and, 
therefore,  some  of  their  interest  may  not  have  been  as  great  on  it. 
But  internationally—dealing  with  the  international  press,  I’m  not 
sure what the arrangements are. 

The CHAIRMAN. Well, of course, we’re talking here about when it 
might  be  coming  our  way,  and  those  buoys  are  supposed  to  tell  us 
that. 

General  KELLY.  Well,  that’s  what  I’m  telling  you.  I  believe  the 
system  is  in  place  if  this  one  would  have  affected  the  United 
States. 

The CHAIRMAN. Yeah. I’m sorry to take your time. 
Senator Nelson? 

STATEMENT OF HON. E. BENJAMIN NELSON,

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA 

Senator BEN NELSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, 
gentlemen, for helping us understand what is involved in detecting 
and—tsunamis and communicating the information. 

As  it  relates  to  a  globalization  for  a  warning  system  so  that  it’s 
not only—we’re not only capable of communicating the information 
to  affected  locations,  what  would  be  involved  in  making  sure  that 
the  receiving  end  of  the  information  is  capable  of,  not  only  receiv-
ing, but acting on this information? If the information goes out, and 
there’s  no  reaction  to  it,  obviously,  then,  it’s  not  terribly  helpful. 
We  will  have  committed  our—we  will  have  fulfilled  our  responsi-
bility,  but  we’re  certainly  not  going  to  get  the  result  we’re  looking 
for.  And  if  $350  million  of  aid  is  going  from  the  United  States, 
given the fact that there’s also private aid that will go, what would 
be involved in making sure that we have receivers at the other end 
so  that  there  could  be  action  taken  on  it?  And,  also,  what  barriers 
might  we  encounter?  And  some  idea  of  the  cost.  I  suspect  that  if

we’re  looking  at  this  in  terms  of  dollars  and  cents,  there  may  be 
a way to quantify it. There is no way to quantify or qualify the un-
told  misery  and  loss  of  life  and  the  disruption  to  entire  areas 
around the world. 
Dr. Marburger? 
Dr. MARBURGER. Yes, let me take a crack at that. 
First, the most important part of the receiving nation’s capability 
must  be  communications  and  education  systems,  country  by  coun-
try, in the affected countries. And it is necessary for some of those 
countries  in  the  Indian  Ocean  periphery  to  build  from  scratch. 
There’s  a  great  deal  of  unevenness  in  the  state  of  development  in 
those  countries,  as  you  well  know.  The  most  capable  countries  are 
already  on  their  way  toward  building  systems  like  ours  in  their 
countries. 

Senator BEN NELSON. Were they in the process of doing that be-

fore this, or is this subsequent to the event? 

Dr.  MARBURGER.  I  believe  that  some  of  those  countries  were, 
countries like India and Australia and Indonesia, Thailand all have 
important  capabilities.  And  as  a  result  of  the  meeting  that  I  at-
tended last weekend in Thailand, it became clear to me that those 
countries  are  likely  to  be  the  centers.  Just  as  the  U.S.  and  Japan 
and  some  other  countries  around  the  Pacific  have  strong  systems, 
I  believe  those  systems  will  begin  to  emerge  in  the  Asian  nations 
around the Indian Ocean. 

The  U.S.  will  participate  in  advising  and  helping  those  nations 
to develop strong programs, which include more than just the sens-
ing  systems.  We  have  a  great  deal  of  experience.  We  work  closely 
with  the  UNESCO  IOC,  and  they  are  on  the  scene  and  helping  to 
advise  those  countries,  as  well.  I  believe  that  aid  will  be  required, 
and  that  aid  will  be  delivered  through  the  normal  channels,  but, 
at  this  time,  I  can’t  make  an  estimate  of  how  much  might  be  nec-
essary. 

Senator BEN NELSON. Could somebody else help us? Yes? 
Dr.  BEMENT.  I  think  education  and  preparation  is  vitally  impor-
tant,  especially  in  being  able  to  do  risk  and  vulnerability  assess-
ment. It’s critically important that there be lifelines that are robust 
and can function under this type of a disaster. And I think our field 
surveys will inform that process. 

We’re  discovering  that  there  are  many  bridges  that  were  not 
pinned  to  their  support  structures,  that  were  washed  away.  That 
affected,  not  only  food  and  water  supply,  but  also  medical  evacu-
ation.  There  are  many  structures  on  the  coastal  regions  that  were 
not  built  to  earthquake  codes.  We’re  still  sorting  out  what  was 
earthquake-related  and  what  was  tsunami-related.  Unfortunately, 
they both reinforced one another. 

But detection is one thing. Casting that detection into a suitable 
warning  system  based  on  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  that’s 
done  before-the-fact,  so  you  can  at  least  have  an  understanding  of 
how  much  damage  can  be  done  and  what  prior  preparation  would 
help mitigate the event, I think, is critical——

Senator BEN NELSON. So——
Dr. BEMENT.—in this particular instance. 
Senator  BEN NELSON.—our  ability  to  detect,  without  the  capa-
bility  to  followup,  is  inadequate  in  order  for  these  countries  to  be 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  13:59 Nov 17, 2005 Jkt 022845 PO 00000 Frm 00051 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\22845.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

48

able  to  respond,  even  though  we  may.  And  I  suspect  that  those 
three  buoys  will  be  corrected  rather  quickly  in  the  Alaskan  area. 
I sense the Chairman’s——

Dr. BEMENT. I think Dr. Marburger, in his——
Senator BEN NELSON.—interest in doing that, yes. 
Dr.  BEMENT.—Dr.  Marburger,  in  his  written  testimony,  I  think 
spelled  out  all  the  elements  that  are  needed  for  a  robust  system, 
and  it  involves,  not  only  detection  and  warning,  it  requires  a  good 
response  plan,  a  good  recovery  plan,  and  it  also  requires  an  infra-
structure that has lifelines that will survive the event. 

Senator BEN NELSON. Now——
Dr. GROAT. Senator, could I—oh, excuse me. 
Senator BEN NELSON. Sure. Yes, Dr. Groat? 
Dr.  GROAT.  Just  one  particularly  challenging  aspect  of  this,  not 
only  internationally,  but  domestically,  that  we  all  have  to  worry 
about is the fact that if the rock drops in the pond, and the waves 
come  from  some  great  distance,  we  have  plenty  of  time—literally 
hours,  in  some  cases.  And  if  there  is  a  structure  in  place  to  get 
warnings  to  citizens—news  media,  weather—whatever  it  happens 
to be—were in decent shape, particularly in the United States. The 
challenge  comes  if  this  subduction-zone-caused  earthquake-gen-
erated  tsunami  is  just  a  few  miles  off  the  coast,  as  it  was  in  the 
case of Sumatra, where we have very little time, then the challenge 
of  getting  that  information,  that  it  is  likely  to  have  generated  a 
tsunami,  into  the  hands  of  the  response  agencies,  even  when 
they’re  sophisticated,  as  they  generally  are  in  the  United  States, 
and then eliciting the proper response from the citizens, is a super 
challenge for all of us. And that’s where these communication links 
and  education  links  and  programs,  such  as  the  program  that 
NOAA supports, are so important, and the engagement of local gov-
ernments  and  regional  governments  and  all  of  the  preparedness 
agencies is so critical. 

So literally you have little time, other than to say there’s a likely 
tsunami, the tide gauges and others indicate that it may be coming 
is  to—the  run-for-your-life  business  has  to  be  communicated  very 
quickly  and  very  effectively.  And  that’s  a  challenge  even  in  our 
country, where we could probably do it pretty well, but in the coun-
tries  that  we  were  just  talking  about,  it’s  a  whole  other  order  of 
magnitude to do that. 

Senator BEN NELSON. Is it possible for us to improve from ‘‘pret-

ty well’’ to ‘‘very well’’? 

Dr.  GROAT.  I  think  we  can.  I  think  the  Subcommittee  you  de-
scribed as having created is going to create a much broader aware-
ness  of  the  array  of  natural  hazards  that  we  have.  Tsunamis  are 
certainly  one,  but  earthquakes,  landslides,  hurricanes,  all  of  those 
things  that  affect  populations  very  quickly,  need  to  be  paid  atten-
tion  to,  not  only  from  how-they-occur,  when-they-occur  warnings 
systems,  but  creating  that  education  process  that  puts  our  popu-
lations-at-risk  at  less  risk.  And  I  think  this  Subcommittee  can  go 
a long way in helping that happen. 
Senator BEN NELSON. Thank you. 
And thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. Thank you for your comments.

If  the  information  we’re  getting  from  some  people  about  global 
climate change is correct, we may be in for a lot more of these than 
we  anticipate  right  now,  so  I  think  it’s  essential  that  we  take  this 
action. That’s why we created that Subcommittee. 

Senator Smith? 

STATEMENT OF HON. GORDON H. SMITH,

U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON 

Senator SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wonder if I can ask 

that my longer opening statement be included in the record. 

The CHAIRMAN. Sure. It will be. 
Senator SMITH. Gentlemen, thank you for being here and for con-
sidering our implications of S. 50, which is the subject of this hear-
ing. 

As  a  Senator  from  a  coastal  state,  I’m  very  mindful  that  85  per-
cent of tsunamis occur in the Pacific. I’m also mindful that Oregon 
is  right  in  the  middle  of  a  Cascadia  Subduction  Zone.  Apparently, 
according  to  your  written  testimony,  Dr.  Groat,  about  every  few 
hundred years there’s a major shift in this zone. And the last time 
it  shifted  was  in  1700,  and  that  that  produced  a  tsunami  on  the 
Oregon  coast  the  equivalent  of  what  occurred  in  Southeast  Asia. 
And  I  understand  you’re  saying  that  there  is  a  10  to  15  percent 
chance that that will occur in the next 50 years. 

Dr. GROAT. That’s correct. 
Senator  SMITH.  I  guess,  on  the  basis  of  that,  that  we’re  at  the 
end of that likely millennial period where we could suffer another. 
I’m  wondering  if  S.  50,  and  the  changes  that  are  proposed  in  that 
bill,  are  sufficient  to  give  Oregonians,  Washingtonians,  Califor-
nians,  and  Alaskans  the  warning  time  that  they  would  need  to 
avoid the kind of devastation we saw in Southeast Asia. 

I  say  that,  because  I  understand  that  this  plate  is  close  enough 
to  the  coast  of  Oregon  that  it  would  only  give  coastal  residents 
somewhere  between  10  to  30  minutes  to  retreat.  Are  the  systems 
in place to save their lives? 

Dr. GROAT. Let me first comment, Senator, from the role that the 
USGS  plays  in  this—and  that  is  that  if  the  upgrades  that  we’re 
talking  about  in  the  seismic  systems,  and  the  ability  to  interpret 
the  information  that  would  occur  from  an  earthquake  in  the  zone 
you just described, were processed and communicated in the way—
I  think,  in  a  technical  sense,  the  bill  does  recognize  the  role  that 
we  would  play  in  providing  that  information  to  the  appropriate 
places and to the appropriate agencies. I would have to rely on oth-
ers  to  comment  as  to  whether—once  that  got  communicated, 
whether there was a system in place that would, in fact, warn Or-
egonians  quickly  enough  to  respond  in  the  way  that  I  just  de-
scribed. 

Senator  SMITH.  I’m  mindful,  having  come  from  my  state  legisla-
ture,  that  we  have  done  a  great  deal  of  work  on  this  issue,  but  I 
wonder  if  you’re  aware,  Are  other  states  on  the  Pacific  Coast—are 
they  making  sufficient  preparations  for  warning  systems?  I 
mean——

General  KELLY.  Senator,  let  me  address  it  from  the  National 
Weather  Service  point  of  view.  Within  the  National  Weather  Serv-
ice, we have a program called TsunamiReady. It is not a very com-

plicated  program.  It  is—you  ask  the  coastal  community  to  have 
some  point  where  the  warning  information  could  come.  You  ask 
that  that  be  manned  24  hours  a  day,  7  days  a  week.  You  ask  that 
they have developed a communications system to get that warning 
out  to  the  citizens  in  that  community,  and  that  they  have  thought 
through where we would evacuate the citizens to in the event that 
warning  came,  and  they  have  some  scheme  or  practice  schedule  to 
practice evacuations. 

And  if  they  have  that,  we,  in  the  Weather  Service,  designate 
them as TsunamiReady. They get a number of big placards that go 
on  the  state  highways  and  the  roadways  coming  in.  There’s  little 
notes at the bottom of them which says things like, ‘‘If you feel the 
ground  shake,  get  away  from  the  waterfront.’’  That’s  applicable  in 
your  State  of  Oregon.  We  work  in  the  state  of  Washington.  It’s  in 
the  State  of  Hawaii.  It’s  in  the  state  of  Alaska.  The  local  forecast 
offices up and down the West Coast work with the local emergency 
managers. 

I  would  love  to  tell  you  that  99  percent  of  the  local  communities 
are  enrolled  in  that  TsunamiReady  program,  but  I  would  be  mis-
leading  you.  I  think  up  and  down  the  West  Coast  there  may  be  a 
combination  of  15  cities,  slash,  counties  that  are  in  the  program. 
So  what  we  need  to  do  is  redouble  our  efforts  to  start  working 
with  the  local  areas,  because,  in  the  final  analysis,  the  local  com-
munities  have  to  be  where  the  action  will  take  to  get  the  citizens 
ready to move out of the way of this event. 

Senator SMITH. Are you gentlemen, in your positions, are you fa-
miliar  with  the  Hinsdale  Wave  Research  Center  at  Oregon  State 
University? 

Dr.  BEMENT.  Well,  the  National  Science  Foundation  supports 

that center, so we’re very familiar with it. 

Senator  SMITH.  I  had  the  privilege  of  touring  that  with  Dr.  Cox, 
who  will  be  on  the  next  panel.  I  hope  you  make  good  use  of  it.  It 
is  a  spectacular  facility  that  certainly  taught  me  a  lot  about 
tsunamis, long before this one occurred in Southeast Asia. And it’s 
a remarkable asset that we have to spread information about what 
we’re facing if you live on the coast. 

And I’m wondering about inundation mapping. Can that help en-
sure that coastal residents immediately know when to go and what 
to do? How——

Dr. BEMENT. I think that’s part of the prevention and education. 
Some  of  our  reconnaissance  teams  now  are  trying  to  infer  wave 
heights  based  on  water  lines  and  inundation  surveys  that  they’re 
currently  doing,  because  one  of  the  weak  points  in  our  predictive 
models  are  the  runup  part  of  the  event,  where  it  hits  the  shore. 
And  enclosed  bays,  estuaries,  and  the  beach  gradient  can  have  a 
big  effect  on  how  large  that  wave  will  be  when  it  hits.  And  those 
are areas where we need to refine our current models. 

Senator SMITH. Not only refining the models, but my question is, 
because  of  what  happened  in  Asia,  Do  you  have  sufficient  funding 
to  complete  these  inundation  mappings?  Because  I  think  that 
that—if  not,  we  need  to  get  you  the  money,  because  people  need 
to  know  where  they  can  go,  in  their  geography,  to  avoid  the  wave. 
Dr.  BEMENT.  Well,  we  do  need  to  respond  to  that  in  our  future-
year budgets. Currently, we’re planning workshops this spring and

summer  to  assimilate  and  understand  the  data  coming  back  from 
the  survey  teams.  And  based  on  those  reports,  we  will  be  devel-
oping  longer-range  research  activities,  and  we’ll  probably  have  to 
incorporate that in our budget for next year. 

Senator  SMITH.  I  would  strongly  urge  you  to  do  that.  Senator 
Stevens  has  a  lot  of  sway  on  the  Appropriations  Committee.  And 
I just think if you need funding for inundation mapping——

Dr.  BEMENT.  Well,  I  did  shift  some  funding  for  next  fiscal-year 
request  to  help  address  some  of  that,  but  it  may  not  be  adequate. 
Senator SMITH. Anything that it needs—you need to make it ade-

quate, on behalf of the people of Oregon, please do it. 

Dr. BEMENT. Thank you. 
Senator SMITH. Thanks. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Smith follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. GORDON H. SMITH, U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON 
Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for holding this hearing and for including on 
today’s  witness  list  Dr.  Daniel  Cox  from  the  O.H.  Hinsdale  Wave  Research  Center 
at Oregon State University (OSU). I had the opportunity to tour OSU’s research fa-
cilities  with  Dr.  Cox  last  year.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  him  as  well  as  the 
other panelists. I want to thank each of today’s witnesses for being here. 

As  a  Senator  from  a  coastal  state,  I  have  a  very  obvious  interest  in  today’s  pro-
ceedings.  Eighty-five  percent  of  tsunamis  occur  in  the  Pacific  Ocean.  While  in  the 
United  States  we  have  been  fortunate  not  to  have  experienced  destruction  on  the 
scale  currently  seen  in  southeast  Asia,  the  recent  tragedy  reminds  how  important 
it  is  that  our  communities  are  prepared  in  the  event  that  a  major  tsunami  strikes 
our coast. 

Running along the Pacific Northwest—stretching from northern California to Brit-
ish  Columbia—lies  the  Cascadia  Subduction  Zone.  Research  has  shown  that  the 
Cascadia  Subduction  Zone  has  unleashed  massive  earthquakes  off  the  coast  of  the 
Pacific  Northwest  every  few  hundred  years.  The  last  such  quake  occurred  in  Janu-
ary 1700. This event was similar in magnitude to the Sumatra earthquake and sent 
huge tidal waves barreling into the shores of the Pacific Northwest. 

In  testimony  prepared  for  today,  Dr.  Groat  writes  that  ‘‘there  is  a  10–14  percent 
chance  of  a  repeat  of  the  Cascadia  magnitude  9  earthquake  and  tsunami  event  in 
the  next  50  years.’’  Scientists  estimate  that  given  the  proximity  of  the  subduction 
zone to the coast—approximately 70 miles off shore—it would take a tsunami rough-
ly 10 to 30 minutes from the time the fault line ruptured to strike the Oregon coast. 
Warning  and  detection  systems  are  important,  but  alone  they  are  not  enough  to 
protect  our  coastal  communities.  Our  coastal  residents  must  know  where  to  go  and 
what  to  do  when  the  ground  begins  to  shake.  To  protect  the  safety  of  our  coastal 
residents, we must continue to work with our state and local partners to accelerate 
tsunami  inundation  zone  mapping  and  ensure  contingency  plans  are  in  place  for 
rapid evacuation of vulnerable low-lying communities. 

I was pleased to join Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, and a number of my other 
Senate  colleagues  last  week  in  introducing  the  Tsunami  Preparedness  Act  of  2005. 
By  improving  tsunami  detection  and  warning  systems,  as  well  as  inundation  map-
ping and community outreach and education, I am hopeful that this legislation will 
go  along  way  toward  helping  our  coast  be  better  prepared  should  a  tsunami  strike. 
Thankfully,  these  events  are  rare  and  the  cost  of  preparing  for  them  is  miniscule 
compared  to  the  loss  of  life  and  property  that  could  result  if  we  are  caught  ill-
equipped. 

Mr. Chairman, I thank you again for holding this hearing and for the opportunity 
to  speak.  I  look  forward  to  learning  more  from  today’s  panelists.  I  also  ask  unani-
mous  consent  that  the  testimony  of  the  Oregon  Coastal  Zone  Management  Associa-
tion be entered into the Committee record.

The CHAIRMAN. Senator DeMint? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JIM DEMINT,

U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA 

Senator DEMINT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I’m from South Carolina, so I’m on the Atlantic side, and I think 
what  you’re  suggesting,  we’re  not  at  nearly  as  much  risk,  is  that 
what  I  understand  from  the  panel?  Although  there  may  be  some 
applications that we need on the East Coast. 

Just  a  quick  question,  I  guess,  to  anyone  on  the  panel,  in  the—
is, I appreciate the information that you’ve shared. I certainly don’t 
pretend  to  be  anywhere  near  an  expert  on  what  you’re  talking 
about  after  a  few  minutes,  but,  based  on  what  you’ve  told  me,  I 
have  a—somewhat  of  a  concern  that  we  might  be  quickly  expand-
ing antiquated technology in order to cover our bases as quickly as 
we  can.  The  failure  rate  of  these  buoys  is  apparently  a  concern  to 
everyone  who’s  heard  that,  and  it  doesn’t  sound  like  a  quick  fix  or 
a few new parts is going to solve the service problem of these. And 
my  question  is  simply,  Has  there  been  a  coordinated  attempt  to 
look  at  all  the  technology  that’s  available  to  see  if  water-based  is 
really  the  way  to  go?  Are  there  land-based  water-level  measure-
ments that could go out several hundred miles that could give, par-
ticularly  states  like  Oregon  that  expect  a  very  short  notice,  a 
quicker  way  to  respond  than  something  that’s  floating  around  in 
the  ocean  that  may  not  be  working?  That  would  be  my  only  ques-
tion. I think everyone is going to be interested in funding whatever 
works.  But  from  what  I’ve  heard  today,  I’m  a  little  concerned  that 
what we may be funding might not be the most reliable way to go. 

General? 
General  KELLY.  Senator,  on  the  observation  side,  there  are  two 
components to it. One, there is—there are the DART buoys. Larger 
in  number  are  the  tide  gauges  I  mentioned.  We’re  going  to  put 
some  38  new  ones  in.  There  are  a  number  of  tide  gauges  up  and 
down the United States coasts today. They serve multiple purposes, 
not just for tsunamis. 

The  utility  of  the  DART  buoy  is,  with  it  being  out  in  the  deep 
water, you get an earlier confirmation as to whether a tsunami has 
or has not occurred. On the side that it has not occurred, that pre-
vents  the  number  of  false  alarms  from  being  too  high.  On  the  fact 
that it did occur, then you can give more positive statements to the 
citizens that something not very nice is coming their way. 

Yes, we have challenges with the DART buoys. We’ve had trouble 
maintaining  them.  I  would  point  out  that  we  know  of  no  other 
country in the world that has developed a technology like this. The 
Germans  contend  they  have  a  system.  But  the  best  I  can  deter-
mine,  no  one  has  ever  gotten  any  data  from  the  system  and  been 
able ever to see—to operate. 

So  I  don’t  want  to  minimize  the  technical  accomplishments  that 
the researchers that have developed these DART buoys have made 
in doing it. And, yes, indeed, we do have some reliability problems 
with them, but when you’re dealing with high-tech equipment—and 
I’m  not  trying  to  minimize  that—that’s  not  an  unusual  thing.  It  is 
not  our  intention  to,  with  all  the  new  DART  buoys  that  are  going 
out  there,  to  replicate  old  technology  that  has  given  us  mainte-
nance problems. We are going to try to make it more robust. 

But we believe the data from the DART buoys is an essential ele-
ment of the observing network. It is not the only element, as I tried 
to  say  earlier.  It’s  regrettable  that  three  of  the  six  are  down.  We 
still  have  some  capability.  We  would  like  to  have  more  capability.

But  we  do  believe  that  the  DARTs  are  an  important  part,  and  we 
are going to try to make them more reliable. 

Senator DEMINT. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Cantwell? 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL,

U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  ask  that  my 

statement be inserted in the record. 

The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  thank  you 
for holding this hearing on the Tsunami Preparedness Act of 2005. 
I  had  an  opportunity,  in  the  last  10  days,  to  visit  the  Pacific  Ma-
rine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle that is part of the NOAA 
operations. And, first and foremost, I want to thank the Chairman 
and the Ranking Member for their diligence on this issue. 

When  a  crisis  happens,  you  go  back  and  look  and  see  how  pre-
pared we are to date, and one thing that is very clear to me is that 
Senator  Stevens  and  Senator  Inouye,  because  of  incidents  that 
have  happened  in  their  states,  have  put  a  lot  of  energy  into  focus-
ing on this issue and getting us where we are to date. 

I  had  the  chance  to  see  the  current  DART  buoy,  and  to  under-
stand the information system that connects to it and how it relays 
information.  And  I  also  got  a  chance  to  see  the  next-generation 
buoys, which will be much easier to deploy. So I have a good sense 
of  where  we’re  heading  with  the  technology,  which,  for  taxpayers 
and security reasons, will be much more cost-efficient and reliable. 
Instead of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a research 
vessel  trying  to  go  out  hundreds  of  thousands  of  miles  to  deploy 
this, we might even be able to push them out of an airplane or off 
of any kind of vessel. So we’re making good progress. 

That doesn’t mean that we, in the Northwest, don’t want to know 
when  the  current  buoys  are  going  to  be  fixed.  And  I  know  my  col-
leagues  have  raised  these  questions  already,  so  I  won’t  say  any-
thing  other  than  we’re  very  concerned,  and  we’d  like  them  to  be, 
obviously, operational as quickly as possible. 

The  one  thing  that  is  clear  when  you  see  the  technology  at  the 
Pacific  Marine  Environmental  Laboratory  is  that  this  act  is  really 
about  the  preparedness  element.  It  is  about  mapping.  It  is,  in  the 
sense  of  what  happened  in  Indonesia,  understanding  that  the  ef-
fects  of  such  devastation  basically  wipe  out  roads  and  bridges  and 
they hinder not just evacuation, but also support in the future. 

So my question to General Kelly or to Dr. Groat is just, How far 
can—how fast can we get this mapping done? As you know, the last 
time  we  had  a  major  earthquake  was  in  the  year  1700.  A  30-foot-
high tsunami smashed into our coastline, and the USGS estimates 
that  there  is  a  10  to  14  percent  chance  that  another  major 
Cascadia  quake  could  happen  in  the  next  50  years.  We’re  very  in-
terested in how soon the mapping could happen. And exactly, then, 
what  does  the  mapping  provide  us,  in  the  sense  of  local  law  en-
forcement  and  others,  regarding  the  certainty  of  our  preparedness 
efforts?

Dr. BEMENT. Senator Cantwell, the field data that’s coming back 
will  help  inform  the  mapping  process.  But  we  currently  have  re-
mote  sensors—high  resolution,  medium  resolution,  low  resolution 
sensors that are actually gathering data in real time of the affected 
regions  in  this  latest  disaster.  Once  we  assimilate  that  data,  we 
will be able to accelerate, I think, the mapping effort. And by learn-
ing  through  our  predictive  models  we  can  infer  what  the  damage 
zones would be if such an earthquake were to happen, for example, 
at the Cascadia fault line, which is about as large as the fault line 
in the Indian Ocean. The extent. It’s almost a similar event. 

As far as timelines are concerned, I’m not at the position to real-
ly  lay  that  out  in  any  great  detail,  but  I  think  we’re  going  to  be 
much better informed about how to go about doing that. 

Dr.  GROAT.  If  I  could  comment,  Senator  Cantwell,  you’ve  hit 
upon a very sensitive point, I think, with both U.S. Geological Sur-
vey and NOAA. There are several kinds of maps that are useful in 
this  process.  Inundation  maps  clearly  are  important.  Accurate 
maps  upon  which  models  can  be  built  are  important.  But  they  de-
pend  on,  in  our  case,  the  topographic  maps  that  show  the  details 
of the topography on the onshore areas, and, in the case of NOAA’s 
responsibilities,  the  bathymetric  maps  that  are  offshore.  Having 
the  most  modern,  current  information  about  what  the  land  looks 
like  and  what  the  sea  bottom  looks  like  is  really  critical  to  pro-
viding the information for inundation maps and for providing infor-
mation  to  response  agencies  about  surges  in  areas  that  might  be 
affected. 

I know in our case—and I can’t speak for General Kelly—getting 
that  information  as  current  as  it  needs  to  be—many  of  our  maps 
are  27  years  old—so  that  it  reflects  the  coast  as  it  is  today,  and 
the  infrastructure  as  it  is  today,  is  a  real  challenge  for  us.  And  if 
we’re talking about funding challenges to provide information need-
ed for those efforts, this is one, in our case, where the topography—
the  mapping  of  the  topography  needs  to  be  modern,  needs  to  be 
current,  needs  to  be  digital,  so  that  it  can  go  into  the  models  and 
into  the  inundation  mapping.  And  I  know  General  Kelly  has  simi-
lar concerns. 

General KELLY. I’ll just second what Dr. Groat said. It is a chal-
lenge  to  get  current  surveys  of  the  undersea  and  what  the  shore-
line and the surface—sea surface is. 

Senator CANTWELL. So are we talking years? 
Dr.  GROAT.  I  think  the  capabilities  are  there  now,  with  LIDAR 
and  some  of  the  technologies  that  provide  information  about  the 
landscape  in  digital  form,  to  turn  those  into  digital  map  products, 
that  we  don’t  have  to  be  talking  about  very  many  years  in  critical 
coastal  areas.  In  other  words,  we’re  not  talking  about  decade-long 
programs. I think in a matter of a few years, with the funding, we 
could  have  current,  update  digital  information  about  the  areas  of 
the coast that are likely to be impacted by this sort of event. 

Dr. BEMENT. I can say that, if you look at just the area—the ter-
rain that’s above the water level, the inland terrain, there are geo-
detic surveys that are currently underway, some involving Caltech, 
other  universities  that  are  involved.  And  that’s  part  of  the  survey 
work  that’s  currently  going  on  at  the  present  time.  Now,  how  all 
that  geodetic  information  will  be  factored  back  into  topological

55

maps  and  update  the  maps,  that’s  outside  the  science  area.  That’s 
more than the——

Dr. GROAT. We do have a framework for that, called the National 
Map, and it’s an attempt to bring information from the sources that 
Dr.  Bement  described,  and  others  who  are  gathering  relevant  dig-
ital  information  about  the  landscape,  into  one  framework  so  that 
it is the same around the coast, so we have a product that has set 
standards, set approaches to providing this information that every-
one can use in a standardized fashion. 

So  we  do  have  the  framework,  we  do  have  a  lot  of  organizations 
gathering  it.  What  we  don’t  have  is  sufficient  support  to  gather 
that information as quickly as we would like to have it. 

Senator CANTWELL. Well, I think that was the point I was trying 
to draw out. It’s not a next-week project, but it isn’t, also, a 10-year 
time-frame before we’ll have the results we need. 

Dr. GROAT. Exactly. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  And  the  sooner  that  we  can  get  to  the  map-

ping, the better preparedness plans we’ll be able to develop. 

I see my time is almost up, Mr. Chairman, but if I could just ask 

another question about inland waterways. 

I  think  a  lot  of  people  think  of  this  tsunami  threat  as  unique  to 
coastal regions, but Puget Sound, with its population base, cities of 
Seattle  and  Tacoma  and  up  the  coastline  of  Puget  Sound,  Bel-
lingham  and  others,  may  be  as  susceptible  to  a  tsunami  threat  as 
the  outer  coasts.  How  do  you  see  the  inundation  mapping  efforts 
helping  to  prepare  large  communities  with,  in  terms  of  not  just 
evacuating communities but also protecting infrastructure? 

Dr.  GROAT.  I  think  the  mapping  is,  as  you’re  pointing  out  very 
accurately,  needs  to  extend  into  those  inland  bodies,  those  sounds, 
those  estuaries,  those  bays,  that  are  accessible  to  the  sea,  where 
waves can come in—as they have in all cases with these tsunamis, 
if there is an inlet, they’ll come through them—and that the infra-
structure,  as  well  as  the  people  in  there,  needs  to  be  accurately 
represented  so—on  these  maps.  And  that’s  part  of  the  National 
Map, is to include not just the terrain, but the infrastructure that’s 
there—houses, buildings, bridges, so forth. And that needs to be as 
much  in  place  for  areas  facing—you  know,  areas  on  these  inland 
bodies  connected  to  the  sea  as  it  is  on  the  raw  coast.  And  that  is 
part of the structure that we’re talking about. 

Senator CANTWELL. I see. And if I could just throw this in—if we 
had  this  mapping  done  prior  to  December  26,  2004,  and  we  knew 
what was going to happen in Indonesia—which, in fact, I know the 
minute  the  earthquake  happened,  people  ran  to  the  lab  at  the  Pa-
cific  Marine  Environmental  Laboratory  in  Seattle  and  started  try-
ing  to  model  scenarios,  but  by  the  time  they  got  information,  the 
tsunami was actually hitting—but say we had gotten all this map-
ping  done  3  or  5  years  ago.  What  would  we  have  done  differently 
in preparing that community? 

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Let  me  say,  the  main  problem  in  the  Indian 
Ocean  countries  was  not  the  technical  warning.  The  main  problem 
was the absence of local public education and local communications 
systems.  That  was  the  biggest  thing  that  was  there.  There  were

and knew what to do, but the biggest challenge that we have is to 
provide  infrastructure  in  those  nations  so  that  they  can  educate 
their  people  and  communicate  with  them  when  they  get  the  infor-
mation. 

So  while  simulations  and  additional  instrumentation  in  the  In-
dian  Ocean  are  important,  nevertheless,  the  most  important  thing 
is  the  public  education  and  the  identification  of  the  critical  infra-
structure long before the tsunami hits. 

Dr.  BEMENT.  One  thing  that’s  going  to  be  a  major  unknown  is 
what  really  changed  as  a  result  of  the  tsunami  and  the  earth-
quakes  with  regard  to  the  relationship  between  groundwater  and 
surface water and what damage was done to the aquifers that may 
not  be  reversible.  Had  that  information  been  baselined,  we  might 
be able to detect or determine what changes took place. Now, that’s 
one  thing  we  can  yet  do  in  our  own  coastal  regions,  is  to  develop 
that  baseline  data,  so  that  we  would  be  better  informed  what  pos-
sible  damage  might  be  done  to  aquifers  and  other  sources  of  fresh 
water. 

General  KELLY.  Senator  Cantwell,  you  put  your  finger  on  the 
real challenge. And while the death—the number of deaths pale in 
comparison  to  what  happened  in  the  Indian  Ocean,  it  was  a  very 
active  hurricane  season  last  year.  They  were,  overall,  very  well 
forecast. The Government of Haiti was provided good forecasts and 
good information on what was likely to happen with the hurricane, 
and  they  still  lost  3,000  of  their  citizens  due  to  flooding.  And  it’s 
my  belief,  in  large  measure,  that  that’s  tied  to  the  infrastructure 
challenge  that  that  particular  government  faced.  And  so,  it  cuts 
across all natural disasters, and it is a big challenge. 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator. 
Thank you very much, gentlemen. 
I’ll  just  drop  a  little  pebble  in  this  small  bowl  up  here.  Do  you 
ever  think  what  would  happen  if  the  Madrid  fault  slipped  again? 
I  mean,  I  heard  that  bells  rang  in  the  churches  in  Boston  and  the 
Mississippi  changed  its  course.  So,  I  mean,  we  still  have  problems 
all over this country. It’s not necessarily coastline. 

And,  second,  back  years  ago,  the  Navy  was  building  up  Adak, 
and  we  finally  ended  up  with  about  five  different  naval  bases  on 
that little island. We built a tsunami-proof shelter. We didn’t build 
any more, because of the cost of that one. But there are things we 
must  think  about,  and  that  is,  can  we  get  a  tsunami-proof  shelter 
in the areas where they might be needed? I would—I hope that our 
Subcommittee  that  we’re  going  to  create  will  go  into  things  like 
that. 

And we look forward to working with you, but we’re very serious 
about  this  coordination  thing,  now,  and  I  hope  you  will  help  us  by 
giving  us  your  ideas  of,  what  could  we  do  to  assure  that  there 
would  be  proper  notification  to  all  the  public  sources  that  would 
help disseminate news.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

And thank you for holding this hearing and for championing this critical bill. Your 
leadership  and  foresight—along  with  that  of  Senator  Inouye—created  the  existing 
tsunami warning system, and I look forward to working with you to further upgrade 
and modernize this essential service. 

Mr. Chairman, the loss of life and infrastructure incurred as a result of the recent 
tsunami  in  the  Indian  Ocean  provides  a  jarring  reminder  of  the  need  to  evaluate 
the risk of tsunamis to our own coastal populations. 

That’s why this well thought out bill, developed in cooperation with the Adminis-

tration, is so important. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of it. 

I  recently  visited  the  Pacific  Marine  Environmental  Laboratory  in  Seattle,  which 
provides research support for all aspects of the U.S. tsunami program. While I was 
greatly  impressed  with  their  work,  I  also  learned  that  we  can  and  must  do  more. 
Whether  it  is  developing  more  reliable  monitoring  buoys,  or  improving  our  na-

tion’s vulnerability assessments, more resources are needed. 

I  also  learned  more  about  the  massive  Cascadia  fault  that  lies  off  the  coasts  of 
Washington, Oregon, and Northern California and the fact that it is similar in size 
and geologic character to the fault that produced the devastating Indian Ocean tsu-
nami. 

A  major  Cascadia  earthquake—the  last  which  occurred  in  the  year  1700  and  led 
to  a  30-foot  high  tsunami  smashing  into  Washington’s  coastline—could  happen  at 
any  time.  The  U.S.  Geological  Survey  estimates  there  is  a  10  to  14  percent  chance 
of another major Cascadia quake within the next 50 years. 

Since  a  Cascadia-generated  tsunami  would  allow  for  only  10  to  20  minutes  of 
warning, I am pleased that this legislation includes community-based tsunami haz-
ard mitigation program and an acceleration of critical vulnerability assessments and 
inundation maps. This information is critical for coastal communities to plan for fu-
ture tsunami events. 

I’d  also  like  to  thank  Senator  Inouye  and  Stevens  for  accomodating  my  request 
and including language in this bill that requires an assessment of tsunami risks in 
vulnerable  inland  bodies  of  water.  Earthquakes  within  the  Puget  Sound  have  his-
torically produced significant tsunamis, which today would cause significant flooding 
along the waterfront of Seattle and other inner coastal communities. 

So  again,  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  holding  this  hearing.  I  fully  support  the 
Tsunami Preparedness Act and believe it is essential if we are to prevent the devas-
tation  caused  by  the  Indian  Ocean  tsunami  from  one  day  becoming  realty  on  our 
coasts as well.

Senator Inouye? 
Senator INOUYE. I just wanted to clarify the record. In November 
of  2003,  one  of  the  DART  buoys  issued  data  and  suggested  that  a 
massive tsunami was on its way to Hawaii. But thanks to the effi-
ciency of NOAA, they immediately clarified the data and suggested 
it  was  not  hitting  us.  And  we’ve  calculated  that  it  saved  the  State 
of  Hawaii  about  $70  million;  otherwise,  we  would  have  spent  all 
that money. So I want to thank you very much. 

And, Mr. Chairman, may I submit written questions? 
The CHAIRMAN. Yes. * 
The  CHAIRMAN.  I’d  appreciate  it  if  you  would  respond  to  ques-
tions that will be submitted by the individual Senators. And, again, 
we  thank  you,  gentlemen,  for  joining  us.  We  consider  this  to  be  a 
very important first hearing. 

We’ll  now  turn  to  the  second  panel—or  maybe  the  third  panel, 
Dr.  Roger  Hansen,  Professor  of  the  University  of  Alaska  in  Fair-
banks,  the  Director  of  the  Tsunami  Warning  and  Environmental 
System for Alaska; second, Ms. Eileen Shea, Project Coordinator of 
the  East  West  Center,  of  Honolulu,  Hawaii;  and,  third,  Dr.  Daniel 
Cox, the Director of the Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory at Or-
egon State University. 

Senator Smith has a conflict, so, as a matter of courtesy, Dr. Cox, 

we’re going to call on you first.

well and I know that flight very well. Welcome. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Dr.  Cox,  I  welcome  you.  I  left  Oregon  State  Col-

lege to go to war, some 50-odd years ago. Nice to see you here. 
STATEMENT OF DR. DANIEL COX, DIRECTOR, O.H. HINSDALE 
WAVE RESEARCH LABORATORY, OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY 
Dr.  COX.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of 
the  Committee,  for  this  opportunity  to  discuss  the  research  that 
we’re  doing  at  Oregon  State  in  the  Hinsdale  Wave  Research  Lab-
oratory.  I’m  the  director  of  that  laboratory,  and  also  associate  pro-
fessor in civil engineering. 

We  are  home  to  the  world’s  largest  facility  specifically  con-
structed for tsunami research, and I’d like to give you, just, sort of 
briefly, the history of it, just to show you that this has been many, 
many  years  in  the  making,  planning  long  before  I  got  there.  I’ve 
only been there for about 21⁄2 years. 

And  I’d  also  like  to  tell  you  just,  sort  of,  how  the  tsunami  com-
munity  has  come  together,  a  little  bit  about  what  we’re  learning 
about today’s—the recent events, and then how we’re trying to im-
prove  the  nation’s  ability  to  respond  to  tsunami  disasters,  emer-
gency planning, and so on. 

In  the  1990s,  there  was  a  series  of  NSF  workshops  to  decide 
what are the nation’s needs for tsunami research. And, as a result 
of  these  workshops,  there  was  a  proposal  to  come  up  with  a  very 
large  wave  basin.  This  is  a  large  rectangular  concrete  basin  that 
can  very  accurately  repeat  a  tsunami-like  wave.  It’s  called  a 
soliton.  And  the  main  purpose  of  this  facility  is  to  provide  proof 
that  the  numerical  models  are  working  well.  We’ve  heard  a  lot  of 
testimony today talking about inundation mapping and the reliance 
on these maps for telling people where to go, directing them, decid-
ing  what  kind  of  infrastructure  will  be  in  place  after  the  tsunami 
event  happens,  and  so  on.  But  all  of  these  computer  models  have 
to be tested very carefully before we rely on them. 

And we use, to some degree, the fieldwork that’s been done, try-
ing  to  piece  together  the  clues  from  the  site  reconnaissance  sur-
veys.  But  they  don’t  have  enough  information.  They  don’t  give  you 
the wave height, the wave direction in all locations. And so, we can 
very  accurately  make  physical  models  with  very  carefully  con-
trolled  conditions,  and  then  compare  the  results  of  the  physical 
models with what the numerical models predict. And that’s how we 
use our facility. 

We  also  use  it  as  a  sort  of  a  center  for  the  research  community. 
It’s  a  great  place  where  people  gather  and  share  ideas,  exchange 
information.  We  had  two  of  our  professors  going  to  Madras,  to 
India,  to  look  at  the  survey,  the  damage,  and  then  they’ll  come 
back,  share  their  results,  hold  a  series  of  seminars,  and  so  on.  So 
it’s  also  provided  a  great  focal  point  for  the  research  community.

There  was  also  a  report  published  by  the  National  Research 
Council for the NEES program. And, in that report, it outlines very 
specifically what are the challenges for the research in our areas—
and  that  includes  better  understanding  of  the  tsunami  inundation 
that  we  heard  about  earlier  today—and  also  the  tsunami  impact, 
what happens when that wave hits buildings and bridges and other 
critical lifelines that would be necessary in an evacuation. 

The  long-term  goal  is  really  to  develop  a  comprehensive  numer-
ical  model  that  includes  not  only  the  hydrodynamics  of  the  wave 
and the wave impact and the debris flow, but also includes human 
factors—how  people  will  respond  in  a  crisis—and  this  will  greatly 
improve our ability to plan for tsunami attacks—tsunami disasters. 
So  I  just—I’d  like  to  finish  here  and  just  say  that  I  think  we 
have  an  extremely  unique  tool  here  for  the  Nation  to  use.  It’s  a 
shared-use  facility.  It’s  hosted  at  Oregon  State,  but  it’s  really  de-
signed with a number of researchers in mind. We bring them here, 
we do the—the research—the tsunami research is supported by the 
National  Science  Foundation.  So  if  their  proposals  are  accepted, 
then their work is supported in our lab for free, or by the National 
Science Foundation. 

And,  yeah,  with  that,  I’d  be  happy  to  answer  any  questions  that 

you might have. 

[The prepared statement of Dr. Cox follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. DANIEL COX, DIRECTOR, O.H. HINSDALE WAVE 

RESEARCH LABORATORY, OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY 

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee  for  the  opportunity  to 
discuss  how  research  will  continue  to  improve  our  nation’s  ability  to  deal  with  tsu-
nami risks. I am Daniel Cox, Director of the O.H. Hinsdale Wave Research Labora-
tory  at  the  Oregon  State  University  College  of  Engineering,  home  to  the  world’s 
largest and most-wired facility specifically designed for tsunami research. 

Today,  I  would  like  to  provide  some  information  on  how  this  new  Tsunami  Wave 
Basin  facility  is  helping  this  country  better  prepare  for  the  next  tsunami  scenario, 
including development of more effective tsunami warning systems, safer evacuation 
routes and procedures, and better building and bridge design. 

As  mentioned  in  previous  testimony  and  elsewhere,  advanced  numerical  models 
are  essential  for  tsunami  mitigation  and  evacuation  procedures.  These  simulation 
tools  have  been  developed  at  research  universities  like  Oregon  State  over  the  past 
several decades. The guidance and validation of these models, especially the inunda-
tion process of the tsunami wave impacting the coast and flowing over the land, has 
been  achieved  through  careful  comparison  with  laboratory  studies.  It  is  important 
that  we  continue  to  use  the  latest  numerical  techniques  to  improve  their  predictive 
capability  and  systematically  test  their  accuracy  with  benchmark  data  before  we 
rely on them for emergency planning, zoning, and construction guidelines. 
Background  on  the  Development  of  the  Next-Generation,  Shared-Use

Facility for Remote Tsunami Research 

In the 1990s a series of NSF-supported workshops were convened by the tsunami 
research community to determine the needs for supporting the further development 
of tsunami research and numerical models. These workshops led to a document that 
outlined  the  requirements  of  a  large  wave  basin,  capable  of  generating  solitons  (or 
solitary  waves  which  have  tsunami-like  behavior).  In  addition  to  the  physical  re-
quirements and instrumentation of the new facility, the workshops stressed collabo-
ration  and  a  close  integration  of  physical  experiments  and  computer  simulations 
through data sharing and research guidance based on field work and practical appli-
cations.  Many  of  the  researchers  who  participated  in  these  early  workshops  were 
also actively involved in post-tsunami surveys, for example in Nicaragua, Indonesia, 
and Papua New Guinea. Their graduate students have gone on to successful careers 
at places like the NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory to work on tsu-
nami inundation mapping.

In the late 1990s, the need for a tsunami wave basin was recognized at the NSF, 
and  funding  for  up  to  two  facilities  was  included  in  the  initial  call  for  proposals  in 
the  first  solicitation  of  the  George  E.  Brown  Jr.  Network  for  Earthquake  Engineer-
ing Simulation (or NEES) program. Through a competitive proposal process, Oregon 
State  University  was  awarded  a  $4.8M  grant,  which  was  augmented  by  approxi-
mately  $1.2M  from  the  Oregon  State  University  College  of  Engineering.  One  of  the 
first steps was to establish an advisory board of tsunami experts, coastal engineers, 
and computer scientists from universities such as Cal Tech, Cornell, USC, and Dela-
ware,  as  well  as  government  agencies  including  NOAA.  A  second  step  was  to  ac-
tively  engage  the  tsunami  and  coastal  research  community  for  input  on  the  design 
of the new facility, instrumentation, and data sharing requirements. In parallel with 
this,  the  Principle  Investigators  of  the  tsunami  project  at  Oregon  State  continued 
to  work  with  the  entire  NEES  consortium.  The  NSF  funding  also  helped  the  OSU 
College of Engineering attract a world-class team of tsunami experts, computer sci-
entists, and ocean engineers who appeared in many national media reports following 
the  Asian  tsunami  last  December.  Construction  of  the  new  facility  was  completed 
ahead of schedule and commissioned during a ceremony on September 13, 2003. The 
Tsunami  Wave  Basin  at  Oregon  State  University  was  selected  as  one  of  four  out 
of 15 NEES sites showcased in the NSF’s live demonstration of the NEES program 
in November, 2004. 

The  Tsunami  Wave  Basin  facility  itself  (Figure  1)  is  a  large,  rectangular  basin, 
measuring  160  ft.  long  by  87  ft.  wide  by  7  ft.  deep  (48.8  m  x  26.5  m  x  2.1  m)  with 
a wavemaker consisting of a series of programmable wave boards at one end. These 
paddle-like  wave  boards  can  be  programmed  to  move  in  a  carefully  prescribed  mo-
tion  that  generates  a  soliton  (or  solitary  wave),  which  is  a  simplified  form  of  a  tsu-
nami.  At  the  end  of  the  basin  opposite  of  the  wavemaker,  researchers  install 
contoured  terrain  characteristic  of  coastal  features,  such  as  bays  or  points  of  land. 
On  this  terrain,  researchers  can  place  models  of  coastal  infrastructure  such  as 
bridges  and  buildings,  for  example,  instrumented  with  sensors  to  measure  the  im-
pact  of  the  wave  or  debris.  It  is  important  to  note  that  although  the  soliton  is  a 
simplified  representation  of  the  tsunami,  it  is  complex  enough  to  provide  a  strict 
test  for  numerical  models.  In  other  words,  if  a  numerical  simulation  can  not  repro-
duce the simplified conditions of the laboratory, it will have little use as a decision-
making  tool.  In  addition  to  the  construction  of  the  physical  basin,  the  NSF  grant 
provided for the development of cutting-edge information technology (IT) infrastruc-
ture. This IT infrastructure assists in experimental planning, archiving, and sharing 
of  data.  It  also  enables  researchers  anywhere  in  the  nation  to  remotely  participate 
in experiments in real-time, saving travel costs and speeding research. 
Grand Challenges for the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation 

(NEES) and Tsunamis 

A  National  Research  Council  report  published  in  2003  outlines  the  challenges  in 
earthquake engineering as well as a research agenda for the NEES program, includ-
ing  tsunamis.  The  report  provides  the  historical  perspective  of  tsunami  research, 
critical knowledge gaps, and outlines short-term and long-term research goals. 

The report recommends that:

‘‘A  complete  numerical  simulation  of  tsunami  generation,  propagation,  and 
coastal  effects  should  be  developed  to  provide  a  real-time  description  of 
tsunamis  at  the  coastline  for  use  with  warning,  evacuation,  engineering,  and 
mitigation strategies.’’

The short-term goals outlined in this report include:

1. Better understanding of tsunami inundation—how the wave travels over dry 
land.
2. Better understanding of sediment transport under tsunamis.
3. Quantify the impact forces of the tsunami wave and debris on structures.
4. Determine the effects on buildings and groups of buildings.
5.  Work  with  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program  (NTHMP)  to 
refine research needs to best support NOAA’s mission.

Medium-term goals include:

1. Verify and validate numerical models for defining runup limits. 
2.  Work  with  the  geotechnical  community  to  study  the  mechanics  of  landslide 
generated tsunamis.

The long-term goal is summarized as:

Develop  comprehensive,  interactive  scenario  simulations  that  integrate  the 
physical  aspects  (generation,  propagation,  inundation)  with  societal  issues  such 
as  transmission  of  warnings  to  the  public,  evacuation,  environmental  impacts, 
rescue tactics, and short-term and long-term recovery strategies.

What is the Role of the Tsunami Wave Basin for Future Tsunami Disasters? 
The  intended  purpose  of  the  Tsunami  Wave  Basin  at  Oregon  State  University  is 
to provide the research community with a controlled environment for the systematic 
study of primarily tsunami inundation and tsunami generation from landslides. 

Post-tsunami  (reconnaissance)  surveys  provide  new  insights  and  valuable  lessons 
learned  about  the  real  effects  of  the  actual  events.  However,  it  is  impossible  to  col-
lect sufficient and accurate data from surveys to improve numerical models because 
the data/information are ephemeral and difficult to obtain. There is no way to make 
advance  preparations  to  obtain  data  since  it  would  be  a  formidable  task  to  install 
a  sufficient  number  of  sensors  in  the  field  prior  to  a  very  unpredictable  and  rare 
tsunami  event.  For  example,  the  speed  of  the  wave  is  an  important  variable  when 
considering  evacuation  or  the  safe  design  of  buildings  or  bridges,  but  this  data  are 
rarely available. Wave height and direction are also extremely important but elusive 
quantities. 

All  numerical  models  require  known  boundary  conditions  and  initial  (or  starting) 
conditions. Because we have almost no quantitative information about the real tsu-
nami as it approaches the shore, we can not properly prescribe the initial condition, 
and therefore we can not easily compare the damage at the site to the damage pre-
dicted  in  the  model.  The  laboratory,  however,  provides  us  with  a  tool  that  can  pro-
vide  boundary  and  initial  conditions  as  well  as  the  resultant  force  of  the  tsunami 
as it impacts the coast. We can prescribe the same initial condition to the numerical 
simulation  and  then  through  comparisons  with  laboratory  data,  we  can  verify  (or 
refute)  the  accuracy  of  the  simulations.  The  increasing  computational  speed  of  nu-
merical simulations has shown that we can simulate large geographical regions with 
complex shapes. The remaining questions are the accuracy of these simulations and 
inclusion of realistic features such as wave-impacts and debris flows. 
Development of Collaborative Tools for Natural Hazards Mitigation 

We have been developing three separate but closely related research programs on 
integration of hazard mitigation tools and information: (1) tsunami scenario simula-
tions,  (2)  computational  portal,  and  (3)  tsunami  digital  library.  These  activities 
heavily  rely  on  the  advanced  information  technologies,  and  have  direct  impacts  on 
hazard mitigation practice. 
Scenario simulations: 

An alternative to a full-scale field investigation is to perform repeatable and pre-
cisely  controlled  ‘‘scenario’’  simulations.  A  scenario  simulation  means  a  case  study, 
either  in  a  real  or  hypothetical  background  setup.  Tsunami  phenomena  and  effects 
are  simulated  for  given  geographical,  seismological,  geological,  and  societal  condi-
tions.  Simulations  must  be  comprehensive  and  integrated  not  only  in  tsunami  gen-
eration,  propagation,  runup  motion  (flow  velocities  and  inundation)  and  flow-struc-
ture  interactions,  but  also  other  types  of  simulations  such  as  warning  transmission 
to the public, evacuation, environmental impacts, rescue tactics, and short-term and 
long-term recovery strategies. The simulation exercises should include physical mod-
els,  numerical  models,  informatics,  human  behavior,  communication  simulations, 
and  other  exercises  that  will  integrate  the  tsunami  source  with  its  eventual  effects 
on communities and the environment. This activity is by nature a multi-university, 
multi-community,  and  multi-disciplinary  effort.  The  goal  is  to  provide  damage  esti-
mates based on best available information, ultimately leading to earthquake related 
risk  analysis/assignment  for  an  urban  region  and  to  provide  a  rich  problem-solving 
environment  for  the  education  of  students.  A  tsunami  simulation  scenario  must  ac-
tually  expand  this  concept  to  include  the  modeling  of  human  behavior,  since  a  pri-
mary emphasis of tsunami hazard mitigation is not only minimization of structural 
damage  but  also  the  saving  of  lives  through  evacuation.  It  is  emphasized  that  this 
type  of  work  must  be  collaborative.  The  collaboration  with  only  a  few  researchers 
is insufficient; the entire community involvement is essential for the success. 
Tsunami digital library: 

In  recent  years,  the  Internet  has  become  the  primary  source  of  information  and 
data. Before the Internet, the challenge was limited access to information and data. 
Now  the  problem  is  locating  information  relevant  to  their  discipline  and  validating 
the quality of such information. Existing web search technologies are insufficient to 
retrieve  information  that  is  relevant  to  a  particular  scientist’s  context  and  guaran-
teed to have some level of quality assurance. New technology for information search

that addresses both quality and context will substantially increase the effectiveness 
of scientists studying natural hazards and their mitigation, enabling greater under-
standing of hazards and more effective preparedness and response. 

Such  information  and  data  are  highly  diverse,  and  serve  a  very  diverse  commu-
nity.  The  unique  information  challenges  presented  by  tsunamis,  the  history  of  re-
search collaboration among the tsunami scientific community, and increasing public 
awareness of the danger to life posed by natural hazards combine to make tsunamis 
an obvious focus for the first digital library of natural hazard information. The soft-
ware components to be developed as part of this project will be used to develop dig-
ital libraries for other natural hazard domains. 
Computational portal: 

Numerical  modeling  is  an  essential  tool  for  advancing  our  understanding  of  nat-
ural  hazards,  allowing  us  to  study  hazard  characteristics,  impacts,  and  prediction. 
At  the  same  time,  highly  sophisticated  models  impose  complex  requirements  for 
data, computational resources, and knowledgeable interpretation. Typically, it is in-
dividual  researchers  and  mitigation  personnel  who  must  grapple  with  these  prob-
lems.  We  are  developing  a  coordinated,  Web-based  environment  for  sharing  knowl-
edge  about  tsunami  prediction  and  mitigation.  It  will  provide  points-of-entry 
through  which  users  can  access  computational  models  without  the  difficulties  usu-
ally involved in managing data, computing resources, and other operational require-
ments. 
Summary 

The Tsunami Wave Basin at Oregon State University provides tsunami research-
ers  with  a  unique  tool  to  develop  and  test  the  next-generation  of  numerical  models 
for tsunami simulations. The basin is designed as a shared-use laboratory, meaning 
that  is  researchers  from  around  the  country  can  access  it  through  the  Network  for 
Earthquake  Engineering  Simulation  program  supported  by  the  National  Science 
Foundation through 2014. 

I would be happy to answer any questions you might have.

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator do you have any questions? I’d be pleased to yield to you. 
Senator SMITH. Thank you very much, Senator.

Dr. Cox, thank you for being here. I very much enjoyed the tour 
that you gave me. Having listened to today’s testimony—and yours, 
as well—I’m curious as to your thoughts, if you’ve had a chance to 
review  S.  50  and  the  Administration’s  proposal  from  an  academic 
perspective. Do you see these proposals as adequate, in terms of re-
search,  mapping,  and  education?  Do  you  think—is  this  a  sufficient 
step forward? 

Dr. COX. I think it’s a step in the right direction, and I think the 
points  that  are  outlined  today,  the  importance  of  education—once 
you  have  a  warning  system,  and  you  tell  people—you’ve  got  to  tell 
them  what  to  do,  and  they  have  to  know  how  to  respond.  There’s 
no time to educate them during the time of crisis. So I think these 
are all steps in the right direction. 

We’ve  talked  about  inundation  mapping.  The  future  of  inunda-
tion  mapping  is  really  trying  to  start  to  measure  the—or  map  the 
intensity  of  the  event,  not  just  where  the  last  water  line  is.  And 
the intensity is really related to whether or not a building is going 
to withstand the attack or not. So there’s, I think, a lot more work 
that  we  need  to  do  to  better  prepare  ourselves  for  the  inevitable 
tsunami. 

Senator  SMITH.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Cox,  for  being  here,  and,  Mr. 

Chairman, for your courtesy. I appreciate that. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator. 
May we proceed, then? Ms. Shea? 
STATEMENT OF EILEEN L. SHEA, PROJECT COORDINATOR, 

EAST–WEST CENTER, HONOLULU, HAWAII 

Ms.  SHEA.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Inouye,  Members 
of  the  Committee.  It’s  my  honor  to  be  here  today,  and  thank  you 
for  the  invitation  to  talk  about  S.  50,  the  U.S.  Tsunami  Prepared-
ness Act, as well as your general interest in building disaster-resil-
ient coastal communities. 

I  first  sat  in  this  hearing  room  over  30  years  ago,  as  a  NOAA 
employee,  in  Congressional  Affairs,  and  I  believe  that  S.  50  rep-
resents  just  another  step  in  your  long  legacy  in  this  Committee  of 
commitment to the coastal communities, the coastal resources, and 
the coastal businesses of this nation. And, therefore, it is an honor 
to be here. 

I’d  actually  like  to  just  touch  on  three  things,  in  particular,  and 

they have all come up, in one form or another, today. 

The  first  is,  I  want  to  commend  the  Committee  for  taking  a 
multi-hazard perspective on this bill and on building our resilience 
to  tsunamis  and  other  natural  hazards.  The  same  coastal  commu-
nities in Southeast Asia and along the United States that are sub-
ject to tsunamis are also subject to other natural disasters—coastal 
flooding,  typhoons,  hurricanes,  high  wind  and  wave  events.  All  of 
those  events  have  the  potential  to  threaten  life  and  property,  and 
all of those events are things that we need to address if we’re going 
to  build  what  I  like  to  call  an  effective  risk-management  informa-
tion system. 

I  believe  that  S.  50  and  much  of  the  discussion  in  the  testimony 
today  is  headed  in  the  direction  of  building  that  kind  of  risk-man-
agement  information  system,  but  I’d  like  to  pick  up  on  something 
that, Senator Inouye, you mentioned in your opening remarks, Sen-

ator Cantwell has, Senator Nelson has, others have mentioned, the 
idea  of  focusing  on  the  receivers  of  these  informations.  It  really 
doesn’t  matter  how  accurate  and  how  efficient  the  arm  of  a  quar-
terback  is.  If  there  isn’t  a  person  at  the  other  end  waiting  to  re-
ceive  it,  and  a  team  of  people—NGOs,  the  media,  the  civil-society 
community  leaders,  the  governments,  at  a  local  level—a  team  of 
people  who  can  help  get  that  individual  down  the  field  and  in  the 
end zone. 

It  is  essential,  if  we  are  to  pursue  building  disaster-resilient 
coastal communities, that we do focus on those receivers of this in-
formation. An effective warning system, like we’ve heard discussed 
by  many  of  the  panelists  today,  is  a  part  of  that  information  sys-
tem, but we really must invest in that education program. 

And TsunamiReady communities is a good example of helping to 
reach  out  to  communities  and  prepare  them,  but  it’s  only  part  of 
the  picture.  And  we’ve  heard  several  witnesses  today,  as  well  as 
several  of  the  Members,  talk  about  the  broader  education  effort, 
formal  and  informal  education,  technical  training,  and  also  leader-
ship training, building the next generation of leaders of these insti-
tutions that will be responsible for warning and response. 

The  second  element  of  a—for  me—of  an  effective  risk-manage-
ment  system  is  this  concept  of  a  better  understanding  of  vulner-
ability and our choices for adaptation, our choices for building resil-
ience.  We’ve  heard  much  talk  today  about  these  inundation  maps. 
These  are  parts  of  tools  for  understanding  how  exposed  we  are  to 
a risk. How sensitive are we to a risk? The other part of the equa-
tion  is,  how  prepared  are  we  to  deal  with  that?  How  resilient  are 
we?  How  much  like  those  palm  trees  that  Senator  Landrieu  men-
tioned  are  we,  are  our  businesses,  our  infrastructure,  our  key  eco-
nomic  sectors,  and  the  people  in  our  communities  who  call  the 
coastal  zone  ‘‘home’’?  Building  that  partnership,  building  those—
that  understanding  of  vulnerability,  and  our  ability  to  adapt  is  an 
essential part of what we’re about. 

I think that it’s important to remember that building this under-
standing of vulnerability is not just a matter of funding a few socio-
economic  studies.  It’s  about  establishing  a  new  way  to  doing 
science.  It’s  about  participatory  research  in  which  the  decision-
makers and the community leaders and the scientists and the tech-
nical  experts  work  together  in  a  process  of  shared  learning  and 
joint problem-solving. 

It’s  also  important  to  remember  that  this  is  probably  best  done 
at  a  regional  level.  One  size  does  not  fit  all  when  it  comes  to  edu-
cation programs, warning systems, or adaptation. It’s really impor-
tant,  I  think,  as  we  consider  the  next  steps,  that  we  consider  the 
regional effect. 

And,  finally,  it’s  important  to  build  critical  partnerships.  I  don’t 
have  to  add  much  to  the  discussion  today  about  the  international 
partnerships involved in the tsunami, but I will mention that—and 
thinking  about  those  receivers  again—that  one  institution  that 
wasn’t  mentioned  in  the  tsunami  arena  is  the  International  Tsu-
nami Information Center in Honolulu, which is the focus of the re-
ceiving-education—reaching out, education and training both in the 
U.S. and abroad.

Finally,  I  would  like  to  touch  on  a  regional  activity.  There  is,  in 
the  Pacific  now,  something  called  the  Pacific  Risk  Management 
Ohana.  ‘‘Ohana’’  means  family.  ‘‘Ohana’’  means  working  together. 
Three years ago, under the leadership of the NOAA Pacific Services 
Center, all of the federal agencies in the Pacific Islands region who 
work  in  disaster  management  sat  around  a  table  together  to  talk 
about better coordinating the work that they do. As a result of that 
initial  meeting,  the  scientific  institutions  active  in  risk  manage-
ment  in  the  Pacific,  the  Federal  agencies  active  in  risk  manage-
ment  in  the  Pacific,  and  state  and  local  entities  and  organizations 
are all now acting together in the context of PRiMO, a coordinated 
effort  on  the  part  of  all  of  those  interested  institutions  to  work  to-
gether. 

In  one  way,  it’s  an  example  of  the  kind  of  coordination  that 
you’re  calling  for  in  S.  50.  In  other,  it’s  a  reflection  of  how  impor-
tant  it  is  to  do  this  at  the  regional  level,  because  it  is  at  the  re-
gional level where we can work together, touch each other in ways 
that  the  Majority  Leader  mentioned  today.  It’s  about  under-
standing  the  people,  the  resources,  and  the  businesses  in  these 
communities. And I think we’re on our way. 

Thank you for the opportunity. I’ll be happy to answer any ques-

tions. 

[The prepared statement of Ms. Shea follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF EILEEN L. SHEA, PROJECT COORDINATOR, EAST-WEST 

CENTER, HONOLULU, HAWAII 

Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Inouye,  Honorable  Members,  ladies  and  gentlemen, 
ALOHA and thank you for the opportunity to share some thoughts on the U.S. tsu-
nami  warning  system  and  enhancing  our  efforts  to  build  disaster-resilient  coastal 
communities in the wake of the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Your initia-
tive and leadership in this endeavor is crucial and is an important next step in this 
Committee’s longstanding legacy of commitment to the communities, businesses and 
natural  resources  that  call  the  coastal  zones  of  the  world  home.  According  to  the 
Global  Forum  on  Oceans,  Coasts  and  Islands,  coastal  areas  (within  60  km  of  the 
shoreline)  are  home  to  50  percent  of  the  world’s  populations  and  two-thirds  of  the 
world’s largest cities are located on coasts. The final report of the U.S. Commission 
on Ocean Policy notes that approximately 52 percent of the U.S. population resides 
in  coastal  counties  which  constitute  25  percent  of  the  U.S.  land  area  and  include 
economic  activities  that  contribute  approximately  $4.5  trillion  (roughly  half)  of  the 
Nation’s  annual  GDP.  I  am  honored  by  your  invitation  to  contribute  to  your  delib-
erations.  My  thoughts  today  are  based  largely  on  my  work  in  climate  vulnerability 
assessment  and  risk  management  in  the  Pacific,  including  the  use  of  climate  fore-
cast information to support decision-making. 

The  tragic  loss  of  life  and  property  associated  with  the  December  2004  Indian 
Ocean  earthquake  and  tsunami  highlights  the  complex  and  close  relationship  be-
tween  achieving  national  development  goals  and  the  ability  to  anticipate,  prepare 
for,  respond  to  and  recover  from  natural  disasters.  Increasingly,  international  and 
regional  development  bodies  like  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  the 
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are recognizing that effectively man-
aging  the  risks  associated  with  natural  disasters  such  as  tropical  cyclones,  coastal 
inundation  from  storm  surge,  droughts,  floods  and  geologic  hazards  such  as  earth-
quakes  and  tsunamis,  is  an  essential  component  of  an  effective,  long-term  develop-
ment strategy. 

It is important to remember that the same nations that suffered the greatest im-
pacts  from  the  December  2004  tsunami  are  also  highly  vulnerable  to  other  natural 
disasters. Typhoons, floods, and high wind and wave events are frequent visitors to 
the  same  coastal  communities  affected  by  the  recent  tsunami.  As  we  take  steps  to 
reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities to high-impact, low-frequency events 
such as future tsunamis, we should also be strengthening their resilience in the face 
of  other,  more  frequent  and  often  devastating  natural  disasters  including  weather 
and  climate-related  extreme  events  such  as  hurricanes  and  typhoons,  floods,  land-

slides,  drought  and  high  wind  and  wave  events.  In  other  words,  a  comprehensive, 
multi-hazard  approach  is  needed  that  establishes  the  social  (human,  institutional 
and  political)  as  well  as  scientific  and  technical  infrastructure  necessary  to  antici-
pate  and  manage  risks.  If  we  focus  only  on  the  tsunami  hazard  itself,  I  fear  that 
we will be like the proverbial general planning for the past war. 

In  the  2004  World  Disasters  Report:  Focus  on  Community  Resilience,  the  Inter-
national  Federation  of  Red  Cross  and  Red  Crescent  Societies  advocates  a  stronger 
emphasis  on  proactive,  people-centered  approaches  to  building  resilience—rather 
than  simply  understanding  and  describing  a  community’s  vulnerability  to  natural 
and man-made disasters. In this context, the 2004 report highlights the importance 
of  ‘‘understanding  the  ability  of  individuals,  communities  or  businesses  not  only  to 
cope with but also to adapt to adverse conditions and to focus interventions at build-
ing on those strengths’’ with an emphasis on risk reduction and development work. 
I commend your Committee for emphasizing a comprehensive, longer-term approach 
in  your  initial  planning  for  an  effective  U.S.  response  to  the  December  2004  tsu-
nami.  In  this  context  and  in  light  of  other  testimony,  let  me  highlight  the  particu-
larly important elements of such a program. These elements include:

First,  building  information  systems  that  support  pro-active,  comprehensive  risk 
management;
Second, improving understanding of vulnerability and effective adaptation strat-
egies; and
Third,  establishing  and  sustaining  the  critical  partnerships  required  to  develop 
disaster-resilient coastal communities.

Comprehensive Risk Management Information Systems 

Following  the  December  2004  disaster,  we  all  focused  on  what  could  have  been 
done to prevent such an awful loss of lives. Immediate attention was, appropriately, 
given to the technical systems that can provide the basis for more effective advance 
warning  of  future  tsunamis.  The  expansion  of  seismic  and  ocean  monitoring  pro-
grams,  the  establishment  of  warning  centers  and  the  improvement  of  communica-
tions  infrastructure  to  disseminate  warnings  and  alerts  are  all  critical  and  should 
be  pursued  aggressively.  In  this  context,  I  would  like  to  reinforce  the  importance 
of providing warnings and forecasts in language and formats that are accessible, un-
derstandable, useful and usable. In many parts of the U.S. and the world, this will 
involve  translation  into  local  languages  and  the  use  of  relatively  simple  forms  of 
communication  such  as  radio,  phone,  facsimile  and  visual  and  auditory  cues  (such 
as warning flags and sirens) as well as the involvement of trusted, local knowledge 
brokers  such  as  NGOs,  religious,  civic  and,  in  the  case  of  indigenous  populations, 
traditional  leaders  and  teachers.  As  we  saw  with  the  Indian  Ocean  tsunami,  many 
of  the  most  vulnerable  populations  lived  in  remote  communities  without  access  to 
the  communications  infrastructure  of  large  urban  centers.  Reaching  these  commu-
nities remains perhaps the biggest challenge for disaster warning systems. Meeting 
that challenge should be of the highest priority as we move toward a pro-active risk 
management information system since the system will only be effective if it reaches 
those in danger. 

Decades  of  natural  hazards  research,  responding  to  weather  extremes  as  well  as 
my own experience in exploring adaptation to climate-related extreme events in the 
Pacific  suggests,  however,  that  good  international  and  local  warning  systems  are 
only  one  part  of  an  effective  risk  management  information  system.  As  a  colleague 
of  mine  pointed  out  recently,  a  successful  pass  in  the  NFL  requires  not  only  a 
skilled  quarterback  but  a  skilled  receiver  who  not  only  knows  where  on  the  field 
to  be  to  catch  the  ball  but  also  what  he’s  expected  to  do  once  he  has  the  ball.  In 
addition  to  knowing  that  more  effective  warnings  are  produced  and  disseminated, 
we  should  also  be  concerned  with  enhancing  the  knowledge,  skills  and  capabilities 
of  the  receivers  of  those  warnings  including  disaster  management  agencies  and 
other  national  and  local  government  officials,  community  and  business  leaders, 
NGOs  and  other  key  elements  of  civil  society  such  as  women’s  and  youth  groups 
and, ultimately, the public. 

The  concept  of  enhancing  public  awareness  is,  of  course,  not  new  in  the  disaster 
management  world.  There  is  a  strong  foundation  of  ongoing  disaster  preparedness 
education  programs  underway  funded  by  a  number  of  U.S.  Government  agencies 
(e.g.,  NOAA,  FEMA,  USGS),  other  national  and  local  governments;  scientific  and 
educational  institutions  as  well  as  regional  and  international  organizations  and 
technical  institutions.  NOAA’s  Tsunami  Ready  Communities  program  is  a  good  ex-
ample of this existing foundation. I hope that our response to the Indian Ocean tsu-
nami will provide us with an opportunity to strengthen those programs and expand 
their  focus  beyond  warning  and  immediate  response  to  include  a  broader  public

67

awareness  of  the  social,  institutional  and  political  challenges  associated  with  build-
ing more disaster-resilient coastal communities. 

In this context, warning and communications system improvements should be ac-
companied  by  a  broad  education  program  designed  to  enhance  the  cadre  of  individ-
uals  and  institutions  in  the  region  capable  of  assessing  vulnerability,  commu-
nicating  warnings  and  managing  risks  associated  with  natural  disasters.  Such  a 
program should include:

• Targeted  technical  training  to  increase  awareness  of  recent  scientific  develop-
ments in key hazard areas (e.g., tsunamis, weather extremes, climate variability 
and  change)  and  make  new  tools  and  technologies  in  vulnerability  assessment 
risk management decision support available to a wider Asia-Pacific community;
• Leadership  training  programs  in  risk  assessment  and  management  for  rep-
resentatives of government agencies, businesses, universities, NGO’s, and coast-
al communities; and
• Formal  and  informal  education  programs  and  materials  to  broaden  public 
awareness and understanding of disaster risk reduction challenges and opportu-
nities  by  introducing  them  to  the  multi-disciplinary  suite  of  issues  involved  in 
development  and  implementation  of  risk  reduction  strategies.  Such  a  program 
would recognize the importance of knowledge of local communities and cultures 
as  well  as  the  technical  aspects  of  risk  assessment  and  management  including: 
environmental  science  and  technology,  land  use  planning,  health,  civil  society, 
and cultural aspects of leadership, problem solving and decision-making.

As we move forward, we also need to more effectively engage the media as a crit-
ical component of an effective, comprehensive risk management information system. 
Understanding Vulnerability and Promoting Enhanced Resilience 

An  effective  risk  management  information  system  also  requires  a  better  under-
standing of the multi-hazard vulnerability of coastal communities with an emphasis 
on strengthening the resilience of critical infrastructure, key economic sectors, valu-
able  natural  resources  and,  most  importantly,  the  people  who  call  those  commu-
nities home. As some of today’s witnesses have suggested, the provision of high-reso-
lution imagery, geospatial (GIS) technology, risk and vulnerability maps and model-
based decision support tools are important elements of work in this arena. I encour-
age  the  Committee  to  complement  these  traditional  vulnerability  assessment  tools 
with  an  integrated  program  of  research  and  dialogue  focused  on  building 
disaster-resilient coastal communities that  would  draw  on  the  broad  multi-dis-
ciplinary  expertise  of  and  technical  capabilities  of  partners  in  government,  aca-
demia,  business  and  civil  society.  Such  a  program  would  recognize  the  connections 
among  social,  economic  and  environmental  goals  to  reduce  significant  risks  and 
build  sustainable  communities.  In  our  internal  deliberations  following  the  tsunami, 
my  own  organization,  the  East-West  Center,  has  decided  that  the  multi-hazard  ap-
proach  to  building  resilience  in  coastal  communities  is  the  framework  in  which  we 
will organize our post-tsunami program. 

Emphasizing a multi-hazard approach to comprehensive risk management such a 

program might include:

• Targeted  research  to  improve  our  understanding  of  the  links  between  disaster 
risk  reduction  and  sustainable  development;  assess  vulnerabilities  for  key  sec-
tors,  resources  and  populations;  identify  and  explore  opportunities  to  minimize 
the  economic  and  social  impacts  of  disasters;  support  the  integration  of  tradi-
tional  and  local  knowledge  and  practices  with  new  scientific  insights  and  tech-
nology to enhance risk management and adaptation; and explore local, national 
and regional governance options for effective risk management;
• Enhanced  risk  reduction  information  services  including  the  provision  of  high-
resolution  imagery,  geospatial  (GIS)  technology  and  model-based  decision  sup-
port tools as well as support for local, regional and international discussions to 
support  the  emergence  of  an  effective,  multi-hazard  warning  and  disaster  risk 
management  systems  at  local,  national,  regional  and  international  levels;  and
• Dialogue on local, national, regional and international governance options for ef-
fective  risk  management—exploring  how  to  better  coordinate  the  roles  of  gov-
ernment,  civil  society  and  local  communities  in  disaster  warning,  response  and 
risk reduction.

This  last  item  reflects  the  importance  of  using  a  collaborative,  participatory  ap-
proach  that  effectively  engages  the  scientific  community  and  decision-makers  in  a 
process  of  shared  learning  to  understand  vulnerability  and  enhance  resilience.  Re-
turning  to  my  earlier  football  analogy—as  we  all  know,  that  successful  long  pass

requires more than just the quarterback and his receiver; it requires a team of indi-
vidual players and coaches each contributing their special talents and unique exper-
tise  as  part  of  a  coordinated  team  effort  informed  by  history,  a  shared  under-
standing  of  individual  roles  and  expectations  and  months  or  years  of  practice  in 
working together toward a common goal. In thinking about building and sustaining 
disaster-resilient  coastal  communities,  we’ll  want  to  build  a  powerhouse  team  of 
international,  regional  and  international  institutions,  government  officials,  busi-
nesses,  resource  managers,  scientists,  engineers,  educators,  NGOs,  the  media  and 
community  leaders—each  bringing  their  own  insights  and  expertise  to  the  table  in 
a combined effort focused on the future. 
Building and Sustaining Critical Partnerships 

Building  these  partnerships  will  be  a  critical  factor  in  our  success.  As  the  over-
whelming  response  to  the  December  2004  Indian  Ocean  tsunami  demonstrates, 
there  are  a  large  and  diverse  number  of  players  on  a  risk  management  team  rang-
ing  from  individual  community  volunteers  to  international  organizations  like  the 
United  Nations.  Many  of  the  witnesses  today  have  emphasized  the  importance  of 
setting  the  international  elements  of  a  U.S.  tsunami  response  program  in  the  con-
text of existing multi-national programs and institutions such as the United Nations 
International  Strategy  for  Disaster  Reduction  (ISDR);  the  United  Nations  Edu-
cational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO);  the  United  Nations  De-
velopment  Programme  (UNDP);  the  World  Bank  and  regional  development  banks; 
and the planned Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS) among others. 
Earlier  I  referred  to  the  importance  of  integrating  local  and  cultural  knowledge  to 
enhance  the  effectiveness  of  technology  and,  in  this  context,  we  will  also  want  to 
capitalize  on  the  expertise  and  networks  of  a  number  of  regional  organizations  and 
institutions.  In  the  Pacific,  for  example,  development  of  an  effective  multi-hazard, 
risk  management  system  will  likely  involve  technical,  government  leaders;  disaster 
management  and  development  agencies  from  all  Pacific  Rim  nations,  including  the 
United  States;  the  UNESCO  International  Tsunami  Information  Center;  the  South 
Pacific Applied Geosciences Commission (SOPAC), the Secretariat for the Pacific Re-
gional Environment Programme (SPREP), scientific, technical and educational insti-
tutions  throughout  the  region.  Hawaii  alone,  for  example,  is  home  to  a  number  of 
technical  and  educational  institutions  that  stand  ready  to  contribute  to  the  emer-
gence  of  an  effective,  multi-hazard  risk  management  system  in  the  Asia-Pacific  re-
gion  including  the  East-West  Center,  the  Pacific  Disaster  Center,  the  University  of 
Hawaii,  and  the  Center  of  Excellence  for  Disaster  Relief  and  Humanitarian  Assist-
ance  as  well  as  the  regional  programs  of  a  number  of  U.S.  Government  agencies 
such as NOAA, USGS, FEMA and others. As we consider the more local components 
of a comprehensive risk management system, of course, the team will expand to in-
clude  state  and  local  agencies,  communities  and  NGOs.  Coordinating  the  work  of 
these  diverse  partners  is  a  challenge  but  meeting  that  challenge  is  essential  to  ful-
filling our shared obligation to this and future generations. 

I’d  like  to  take  a  moment  to  highlight  an  ongoing  partnership  in  the  Pacific  that 
is  already  beginning  to  demonstrate  the  value  of  innovative  collaboration  and  co-
operation in the area of risk management. About three years ago, the NOAA Pacific 
Services  Center  convened  a  roundtable  discussion  among  the  various  federal,  state 
and local agencies, scientific and educational institutions and regional organizations 
active  in  disaster  management  in  the  American  Flag  and  U.S.  Affiliated  Pacific  Is-
lands.  Those  individual  players  are  now  working  together  as  part  of  a  Pacific  Risk 
Management Ohana (PRiMO). The Hawaiian word Ohana means family and, as the 
name  suggests,  the  various  agencies  and  organizations  active  in  PRiMO  are  identi-
fying  opportunities  to  work  together  in  creative  new  ways  to  advance  critical  ele-
ments  of  an  effective  local  and  regional  multi-hazard  risk  management  system  in-
cluding:  coastal  and  ocean  observing  systems;  data  management;  decision  support 
tools;  communications  infrastructure  and  information  dissemination;  post-disaster 
evaluation and performance indicators; education, outreach and training; and tradi-
tional  knowledge  and  practices.  The  enhanced  level  of  collaboration  represented  by 
PRiMO  helps  put  the  Pacific  in  a  strong  position  to  take  advantage  of  new  techno-
logical capabilities and support the emergence of a comprehensive risk management 
information system in the region. An enhanced program of risk assessment and ad-
aptation  in  the  Pacific  could  contribute  significantly  to  enhancing  the  resilience  of 
the communities, businesses and natural resources of the region and, I believe, pro-
vide a demonstration of the value of not only new technologies but also of innovative 
institutional partnerships focused on comprehensive risk management.

Concluding Remarks 

The overwhelming magnitude of the disaster generated by the December 2004 In-
dian  Ocean  earthquake  and  tsunami  will,  I  suspect,  keep  the  images  of  suffering 
and  devastation  in  our  minds  for  some  time.  With  those  vivid  images  has  come  a 
remarkable  level  of  energy,  generosity  and  commitment  to  assist  those  in  need.  I 
fear,  however,  that  if  history  is  precedent,  that  commitment—like  the  images  from 
the newspapers and television—will begin to fade in the collective memory of those 
not immediately affected by the tragedy. The testimony of today’s witnesses and this 
Committee’s leadership in developing an effective, long-term response, however, sug-
gests that this tragedy can lead to a new level of collaboration and commitment that 
will  last  far  into  the  future.  From  the  devastation  of  a  single  event  in  the  Indian 
Ocean,  I  believe  that  we  can  work  together  to  build  disaster-resilient  coastal  com-
munities  in  the  United  States  and  around  the  world.  Perhaps  the  ultimate  legacy 
of  this  recent  disaster  will  be  the  emergence  of  a  comprehensive  risk  management 
program that will protect the people, communities, economies and natural resources 
who call this planet home. 

Mahalo  nui  loa—thank  you  very  much—for  the  opportunity  to  share  these 
thoughts with you and Godspeed in your deliberations. I would be happy to answer 
any questions you may have.

The CHAIRMAN. I’m sorry to tell you again. I can see people back 
there straining to hear you, Doctor. Pull that mike right up to you, 
please. 

Dr. HANSEN. Is this better? OK. 
Today, tsunami safety in Alaska comes from a strong partnership 
between  several  state  and  federal  agencies  as  a  result  of  the  par-
ticipation  in  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program, 
which  has  been  aided  in  Alaska  by  expanded  roles  for  the  Univer-
sity  of  Alaska,  the  State  Geological  Survey,  the  State  Emergency 
Management  Agency,  and  the  West  Coast  and  Alaska’s  Tsunami 
Warning  Center,  run  by  NOAA.  This  program  consists  of  hazard 
assessment  of  our  coastal  communities  through  tsunami  fore-
casting, monitoring and warning guidance, and education and miti-
gation  at  the  local  levels.  I  will  speak  briefly  on  each  of  these  top-
ics. 

On  March  27th,  1964,  a  magnitude  9.2  earthquake  ripped 
through  the  Prince  William  Sound  in  Southern  Alaska,  generating 
a devastating tsunami. Though the death toll in 1964 is minuscule 
compared to the Indian Ocean disaster, Alaska today still faces dif-

ficult  challenges  for  warning  its  at-risk  communities  of  the  occur-
rence of tsunamis. 

70

These challenges come, in part, from the nature of our remote lo-
cation,  our  irregular  coastlines  with  complex  bathymetry  and  to-
pography,  the  vast  size  of  our  state,  where  our  coastlines  extend 
from  equivalent  distance  of  California  to  the  tips  of  Florida,  that 
we  live  in  one  of  the  most  seismically  active  regions  of  the  world, 
and  the  lack  of  infrastructure  throughout  the  area  for  both  oper-
ations  and  maintenance  of  monitoring  systems,  and  for  consistent 
and timely communication of warning messages. 

Warning guidance. First and foremost, we must be able to detect 
events  that  can  trigger  tsunamis.  And  this  is  done  with  the  use  of 
seismology  and  seismic  networks  as  the  primary  method  to  detect 
earthquakes  that  may  cause  tsunamis.  Sea-level  data,  both  tide 
gauges  and  deep-ocean  buoys,  are  also  monitored  to  verify  the  ex-
istence  of,  and  the  danger  posed  by,  tsunamis.  But  our  primary 
hazard  comes  from  the  local  tsunami  generated  by  nearby  large 
earthquakes in or near the coast of Alaska. 

The deep-ocean buoys, while a part of the larger warning system 
designed for the Pacific-wide tsunamis, are secondary indicators for 
local Alaska warnings. This is because a locally generated tsunami 
wave will likely hit most of Alaska’s coast long before it reaches the 
deep-ocean  buoys.  Therefore,  we  must  rely  on  the  rapid  warnings 
that  can  be  issued  from  the  detection  of  large  earthquakes  by  a 
seismic network. 

Modern  seismic  recordings  can  provide  rapid  information  on 
earthquake location, size, and the distribution of sea-floor deforma-
tion  that  generates  tsunamis.  However,  since  much  of  the  seismic 
network  in  Alaska  has  been  in  operation  since  the  1960’s,  many 
stations are in need of modernizations to achieve this goal. 

Over  the  past  few  years,  the  Alaska  Earthquake  Information 
Center,  the  state’s  seismic  network  operator,  was  tasked,  through 
the  National  Hazard  Program,  to  develop  18  of  these  modern  sta-
tions  for  Alaska  and  ensure  the  timely  delivery  of  this  data  to  the 
warning  centers.  The  university  program  has  now  increased  the 
number  of  modern  stations  that  we  can  provide  to  augment  this 
sparse  improvement,  and,  through  applied  research  efforts,  pro-
vides  some  enhanced  information  on  the  local  earthquakes.  How-
ever,  even  with  the  funding  of  both  the  national  program  and  the 
university  program,  nearly  75  percent  of  Alaska’s  seismic  network 
still relies on outdated equipment. This leaves vast areas of Alaska, 
and, in particular, the very seismically active Aleutian Islands, still 
underpopulated with modern seismic stations. 

Mitigation.  It  is  important  to  recognize  that  a  tsunami  warning 
system  must  go  beyond  just  the  ability  to  detect  a  tsunami  and 
send  a  warning  message.  The  most  important  aspect  of  tsunami 
warning systems is the existence of a mechanism for disseminating 
warning information to the people on the shorelines and for the re-
cipient of the warning messages to understand how to react. 

Tsunami hazard mitigation requires a long-term sustained effort 
of  continuing  public  education  and  responsible  planning  decisions 
in coastal communities. The power of education is clear. 

The state of Alaska partners are well aware of our difficulties in 
reaching  our  more  than  80  communities  at  risk  to  tsunamis.  Im-

proving the warning communication and outreach infrastructure at 
the state and local level for both emergency managers and the pub-
lic represents the most important improvement to be made in Alas-
ka for saving lives. 

Hazard  assessment.  Tsunami  warning  and  safety  procedures  re-
quire  an  understanding  of  hazards  and  risks  associated  with 
tsunamis. In Alaska, led by researchers at the University of Alaska 
Fairbanks,  we  are  evaluating  the  risk  by  constructing  inundation 
maps  for  all  the  at-risk  communities  through  our  super-computer 
modeling  of  tsunami  water  waves  from  scenario  earthquakes  and 
landslides. 

Reliable  modeling  results,  however,  require  that  we  have  accu-
rate bathymetry. And, in fact, we need this bathymetry to a resolu-
tion that is not available in Alaska today. 

Much  of  the  sea  floor  along  the  shallow  waters  off  the  coast  of 
Alaska have not been mapped in many years. Some areas not since 
before  the  1964  Prince  William  Sound  magnitude  9.2  earthquake. 
And  note  that  large  earthquakes  can  change  bathymetry  in  local 
areas of the sea floor by tens of meters. 

Collection of improved bathymetry along Alaska’s coastal commu-
nities should be a top priority for enhanced funding of any tsunami 
program.  In  addition,  it  is  important  to  stabilize  the  funding  nec-
essary to create the numerical models and inundation maps. 

In  summary,  Alaska  has  in  place  a  partnership  to  address  the 
threat  from  tsunamis,  yet  we  still  have  continuing  needs  for  im-
proved  monitoring  with  seismic  and  tide-gauge  networks,  scientific 
infrastructure  for  numerical  forecasting  of  tsunamis,  and  the  civil 
infrastructure to educate and warn people. 

Thank  you,  again,  Mr.  Chairman  and  the  Members  of  the  Com-

mittee. I’m happy to answer any questions you have.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROGER A. HANSEN, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA 

FAIRBANKS; DIRECTOR, ALASKA EARTHQUAKE INFORMATION CENTER 

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, thank you very much for inviting 
me  to  testify.  My  joint  appointment  as  the  State  Seismologist  for  Alaska  and  as  a 
Research  Professor  at  the  Geophysical  Institute  of  the  University  of  Alaska  Fair-
banks  (UAF)  places  me  in  a  unique  and  advantageous  position  to  partner  in  a  tsu-
nami  hazard  mitigation  program  for  Alaska  bringing  together  operational  moni-
toring, education, and research activities. I have been involved in the National Tsu-
nami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP) since its inception as a co-author of the 
Implementation  Plan  nearly  10  years  ago,  and  continuing  to  this  day  as  a  strong 
facilitator and member of the NTHMP Steering committee representing Alaska. My 
unique  position  also  serves  to  manage  the  Alaska  Earthquake  Information  Center 
which  operates  and  maintains  the  over  400  station  Alaska  Seismic  Network  for  re-
gional monitoring of earthquakes and volcanos in Alaska. Our decades long collabo-
ration  and  partnership  with  the  Alaska  Tsunami  Warning  Center  for  seismic  data 
exchange  has  been  recently  strengthened  by  our  involvement  in  the  NTHMP  and 
the related Tsunami Warning and Environmental Observatory for Alaska (TWEAK) 
programs.  TWEAK  has  funded  the  creation  of  a  virtual  center  at  UAF,  called  the 
Alaska  Tsunami  Center  and  Observatory,  that  combines  the  strengths  of  the  Geo-
physical Institute, the Institute of Marine Sciences, and the Alaska Regional Super-
computer  Center  into  one  organization  in  partnership  with  our  federal  and  state 
agencies. 

Tsunami Safety in Alaska comes from a strong partnership between several state 
and  federal  agencies.  The  NTHMP  was  created  with  the  understanding  that  the 
best  way  to  address  the  hazards  posed  by  tsunamis  was  through  a  state/federal 
partnership  that  leveraged  an  improved  ‘‘coordination  and  exchange  of  information 
to  better  utilize  existing  resources.’’  Through  participation  in  the  NOAA  National

Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP), this partnership provides improved 
levels  of  warning  guidance,  hazard  assessment,  and  mitigation;  allowing  an  inte-
grated response in Alaska to a potentially tsunamigenic earthquake. 

It is important to recognize that tsunami warning systems require a sophisticated 
infrastructure  that  goes  well  beyond  just  the  ability  to  detect  a  tsunami  and  send 
a  warning  message.  This  infrastructure  must  include  a  continuing  partnership  be-
tween the state and federal agencies and the local communities at risk to assess the 
hazard  and  provide  levels  of  mitigation  to  minimize  the  risk  to  life  and  property. 
Nowhere  in  the  U.S.  is  such  a  partnership  more  important  than  in  Alaska.  Much 
of  Alaska  is  remote,  with  little  built  infrastructure  for  communications,  harsh  win-
ters, and communities that are located in one of the most seismically active regions 
of the world. Our primary hazard comes from the ‘‘local’’ tsunami generated by near-
by large earthquakes in or near the coast of Alaska, rather than from the ‘‘distant’’ 
tsunami  that  travels  across  the  open  ocean.  In  this  case,  the  deep  ocean  buoys,  or 
‘‘tsunameters’’,  while  a  part  of  the  larger  warning  system  designed  for  U.S.  Pacific-
wide tsunamis, are secondary indicators for Alaska warnings, because a locally gen-
erated tsunami wave will hit the Alaska coast long before it reaches the deep ocean 
buoys.  We  must  rely  on  the  rapid  warnings  issued  from  the  detection  of  the  earth-
quake; and even more so on education, hazard assessment, and mitigation as to how 
to respond to the potential of a tsunami. 

The  U.S.  Tsunami  Warning  System  consists  of  two  warning  centers:  the  Pacific 
Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) in Ewa Beach, Hawaii and (important to Alaska) 
the  West  Coast/Alaska  Tsunami  Warning  Center  (WC/ATWC)  in  Palmer,  Alaska. 
These centers work in cooperation with other NOAA units to perform their mission. 
In Alaska, state agencies such as the Alaska Department of Homeland Security and 
Emergency  Management  (ADHS&EM)  and  the  Alaska  Division  of  Geological  and 
Geophysical Surveys (ADGGS), and the Alaska Tsunami Center and Observatory at 
the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF), are strong partners in the tsunami warn-
ing mission. 
Warning Guidance 

First  and  foremost,  we  must  be  able  to  detect  events  that  can  trigger  tsunamis. 
The current tsunami warning systems are triggered by information from earthquake 
seismic  networks.  Typically,  earthquake  magnitudes  above  certain  levels  cause  tsu-
nami  warnings  to  be  issued.  In  Alaska  the  WC/ATWC  has  the  responsibility  for 
issuing  all  tsunami  warning,  watch,  advisory,  and  information  messages  to  emer-
gency  management  officials.  As  earthquakes  trigger  most  tsunamis,  the  WC/ATWC 
monitors  data  from  seismic  networks  throughout  Alaska  and  worldwide.  While  the 
WC/ATWC maintains a backbone network of 11 seismic stations in Alaska, in order 
to  monitor  for  large  coastal  earthquakes  they  receive  a  subset  of  about  40  stations 
from  the  400-station  combined  seismic  network  of  the  Alaska  Earthquake  Informa-
tion Center (AEIC) and Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO). The data are processed 
in  near-real-time  and  initial  warnings  for  tsunamis  from  large  earthquakes  are 
based solely on seismic data. This is the reason that it is so critical to have modern 
instrumentation  for  application  to  modern  techniques  for  rapid  determination  of 
earthquake  magnitude.  Sea  level  data  (both  tide  gauges  and  deep  ocean  buoys)  are 
also  monitored  to  verify  the  existence  of  and  danger  posed  by  tsunamis.  Bulletins 
are issued through standard NWS channels, such as the NOAA Weather Radio and 
the  NOAA  Weather  Wire  as  well  as  the  FAA  NADIN2  system,  FEMA’s  National 
Warning  System,  State  Emergency  channels,  and  other  means.  (All  Alaska  earth-
quakes are then re-processed by AEIC utilizing the entire combined Alaska Seismic 
Network  and  included  in  the  authoritative  catalog  at  AEIC).  The  NTHMP  funded 
upgrades  to  ¢55  seismic  stations  in  regional  networks  throughout  the  western  U.S. 
This leveraged NTHMP resources with the already substantial investments in seis-
mic networks in order to provide high quality data to the tsunami warning centers. 
AEIC was tasked through NTHMP to develop 18 of these stations for Alaska for de-
livery  to  the  warning  centers.  At  the  request  of  ATWC,  the  TWEAK  program  has 
now  substantially  increased  the  number  of  modern  stations  AEIC  can  provide  to 
augment this sparse improvement. Yet many vast areas of Alaska (and in particular 
the Aleutian Islands) still remain underpopulated with modern seismic stations. 
Hazard Assessment 

Well recognized in the NTHMP, a second part of the tsunami warning and safety 
procedure requires an understanding of hazards and risks associated with tsunamis 
in Alaska. Without a clear understanding of what areas are at risk and which areas 
are  unlikely  to  be  flooded,  it  is  impossible  to  develop  effective  emergency  response 
plans and education programs. To ensure reliable tsunami early detection and haz-
ard  assessment  capabilities,  it  is  essential  to  create  a  numerical  model  to  forecast

future  tsunami  impact  and  flooding  limits  in  specific  coastal  areas.  The  NTHMP 
made  it  a  priority  to  develop  the  expertise  within  each  state  for  providing  tsunami 
flood maps for the states communities at risk. In Alaska we are evaluating the risk 
by  constructing  inundation  maps  for  at-risk  communities  through  modelling  of  the 
tsunami water waves from scenario earthquakes and landslides. This effort for Alas-
ka  is  being  led  by  the  UAF  Alaska  Tsunami  Center  and  Observatory  in  close  col-
laboration  with  ADHS&EM,  ADGGS,  the  UAF  SuperComputer  Center,  and  other 
state and federal partners. As inundation maps for communities are completed, they 
are  presented  to  both  state  and  local  emergency  managers  who  then  use  the  infor-
mation for planning and exercising evacuation routes and safe zones for the commu-
nities visitors, tourists, and local residents. Maps for several communities on Kodiak 
Island,  Homer,  Seldovia,  and  Seward  have  been  or  are  nearly  completed,  and  we 
now wait for needed information on bathymetry for the many other at-risk commu-
nities for which maps will be made. The earlier example of the remoteness of Alaska 
again  affects  our  productivity  in  map  generation.  Many  regions  along  the  shallow 
waters  off  the  coast  of  Alaska  have  not  been  mapped  in  many  years.  Some  areas 
not  since  before  the  1964  Prince  William  Sound  M9.2  earthquake.  Reliable  model-
ling  results  require  that  we  have  accurate  bathymetry  to  a  resolution  that  is  not 
generally  available  except  in  the  lower  48  states,  and  at  a  very  few  communities 
in  Alaska.  Collection  of  improved  bathymetry  should  be  a  top  priority  for  enhanced 
funding  of  any  tsunami  program.  In  addition,  it  is  important  to  stabilize  the  infra-
structure necessary to create the numerical models within Alaska. 
Mitigation and Response 

Arguably the most important aspect of tsunami warning systems is the existence 
of a mechanism for disseminating warning information to the people and businesses 
on  the  shorelines.  It  has  been  recognized  that  tsunami  hazard  mitigation  requires 
a  long-term  sustained  effort.  Tsunami  mitigation  needs  to  be  an  institutionalized 
part  of  continuing  public  education,  emergency  management  and  responsible  plan-
ning decisions in Alaska’s coastal communities. Tsunami education materials, inun-
dation maps, community evacuation maps and signs, warning sirens, and numerous 
other  mitigation-related  products  are  being  developed  as  part  of  the  NTHMP  pro-
gram. These materials are brought to communities by a team of scientists and state-
wide  emergency  planners  on  a  routine  schedule  to  establish  the  infrastructure  for 
education  and  outreach  with  respect  to  tsunami  hazards  and  warnings.  This  infra-
structure of communication between UAF, WC/ATWC, emergency management offi-
cials,  ADGGS,  and  local  communities  is  what  allows  warnings  to  be  disseminated 
and  acted  upon  in  an  efficient  manner  throughout  the  Alaska  Communities.  The 
TWEAK  program  is  assisting  this  through  an  active  education  and  outreach  pro-
gram,  as  well  as  partnering  with  ATWC  and  ADHS&EM  to  purchase  and  install 
tsunami  warning  sirens  in  at  risk  communities.  Discussions  with  the  emergency 
management  community  and  the  Director  of  the  Alaska  Tsunami  Warning  Center 
both concluded that the most useful improvement to be made to the warning system 
in  Alaska  is  to  improve  the  warning  and  communication  infrastructure  at  the  local 
level for both emergency managers and the public. Again, increased funding for tsu-
nami programs for Alaska should also include as a top priority resources for expand-
ing the warning dissemination infrastructure and mitigation activities. 
What is Needed for the Future 

While  Alaska  has  created  an  infrastructure  for  efficient  tsunami  warning  and 
safety  procedures,  our  efforts  are  only  beginning.  As  mentioned  earlier,  the  weak 
link  of  information  and  communication  must  include  not  only  improvements  to  in-
frastructure and data collection and processing, but also include a continuing state/
federal partnership for education and outreach. 

Important  to  tsunami  safety  for  Alaska,  the  TWEAK  program  between  UAF  and 
the  Alaska  regional  level  of  the  NOAA  Weather  Service,  is  a  program  in  support 
of the NTHMP that provides direct assistance to the issues most critical to tsunami 
safety  in  Alaska.  The  TWEAK  program  has  brought  the  federal,  state,  and  univer-
sity  partners  within  Alaska  into  a  mature  organization  of  tsunami  activities  de-
scribed above. A virtual center, called the Alaska Tsunami Center and Observatory, 
has  combined  the  strengths  of  the  Geophysical  Institute,  the  Institute  of  Marine 
Sciences,  and  the  Alaska  Regional  SuperComputer  Center  in  one  organization  in 
partnership  with  our  federal  and  state  agencies.  This  Center  will  continue  to  sup-
port the goals of the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program that are unique 
to the difficult setting of Alaska through improvements and enhancements in moni-
toring, modeling, and education and outreach.

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you  very  much,  Dr.  Hansen.  Sorry  to  be 
reading a memo that just came in from my office. I’m told that you 
just  made  a  little  history,  Doctor,  you  just  lectured  your  graduate 
students  at  the  University  of  Alaska  who  are  tuned  in  and  watch-
ing this on a live broadcast through our Webcast. So thank you for 
coming  here.  And  your  students,  I’m  sure,  will  appreciate  the  fact 
that you’re here and they’re there. 

[Laughter.] 
Dr. HANSEN. They got a free breakfast. 
[Laughter.]

The  CHAIRMAN.  I  think  we  ought  to  thank  them.  You  realize 

what time they had to get up to watch you? 

Dr. HANSEN. Yes. 
The CHAIRMAN. It’s 4 hours earlier than we are. 
But,  anyway,  I  want  to  ask  you,  first,  Dr.  Cox,  Am  I  correct,  in 
reading  your  testimony,  that  you  think  you  could  test  things  like 
buildings? 

Dr. COX. Yes, sir. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Could  you  test  a  model  of  a  tsunami  survival 

hut, if we could devise one? 

Dr. COX. Yes, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. Could you devise one? 
Dr. COX. We’re working on it. And I think, also——
The CHAIRMAN. Are you thinking something that’s big enough for 

a lot of people, or just a little one for individual islands? 

Dr. COX. It—I’m at a loss for words. But the—what we’re looking 
at  is  really,  Can  the  computer—let’s  say,  Could  a  numerical  sim-
ulation  correctly  predict  the  impact  force  on  the  building,  however 
that  building  is  constructed.  And  so,  what  we  measure  in  our  lab-
oratory is the actual force of that wave on a building. 

But we’re—and then, let’s say, for example, how—let’s say, if you 
were  to  design  breakaway  walls,  for  example,  if—let’s  say,  in  a 
hotel,  a  modern  hotel,  if  you  had  two  strong  walls  and  two  weak 
walls,  at  what  point  would  the  weak  walls  break  away,  for  exam-
ple? 

The CHAIRMAN. But I’m going at it a different way. When we did 

the——

Dr. COX. Sure. 
The  CHAIRMAN.—the  building  in  Adak,  we  looked  at  what  could 

survive a wave going over it and coming back over it. OK? 

Dr. COX. Yes. 
The CHAIRMAN. In terms of a lot of people. Can you look at that 
for  the  purpose  of  determining,  could  we  start  a  program  of  some 
sort  of  fairly  inexpensive  shelters  designed  in  a  fashion  that  could 
resist a wave, force it to go over it and come back over it? 

Dr. COX. Yes, sir. And in addition to the design of one particular 
building,  what  we’re  finding  out  from  the  field  surveys  is  that  it’s 
often  the  arrangement  of  the  buildings  that  can  either  increase  or 
decrease the forces. So that’s something else we’ll be testing in the 
laboratory,  is,  how  does  the  arrangement  of  particular  buildings 
improve our ability to withstand the tsunami. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  we  devised  wings  that  were  capable  of 
standing  up  at  greater  than  the  speed  of  sound,  so  I  think  you 
ought  to  be  able  to  find  a  way.  But  the  question  is,  can  you  do  it 
so we can produce them and really help the world to provide some 
shelters  for  these  people,  like  in  areas  just—what  we  just  wit-
nessed out there. 

Dr. COX. Yes, sir, that’s one of the goals at the laboratory. Sure. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Ms.  Shea,  you—how  do  you  interface  with  the  concept  of,  you 

know, warning to people in the outer islands? 

Ms.  SHEA.  It’s  a  very  big  challenge.  Part  of  it  is  a  communica-
tions  challenge,  actually,  not  just  the  physical  technological  sys-
tems,  but  also  language,  and  communicating  in  language  that  is 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  13:59 Nov 17, 2005 Jkt 022845 PO 00000 Frm 00079 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\22845.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

76

understandable.  But  the  other  is  actually  building  local  networks 
of  people  who  are  skilled  in  understanding  what’s  coming  through 
as a warning and then can communicate locally, in local languages 
and in local context. So——

The CHAIRMAN. Do you use commercial media? 
Ms.  SHEA.  Absolutely.  And,  in  fact,  the  role  of  the  media  is  im-
portant, but it’s also important to remember that many of the com-
munities,  those  remote  fishing  communities,  for  example,  that 
were—whose  structures  were  completely  wiped  away,  didn’t  have 
access  to  some  of  the  media.  In  the  United  States,  we  can  rely  on 
the  media  the  way  the  Weather  Service  has  done  for  years.  And  I 
think  it’s  really  important  that  we  consider  the  role  of  the  media 
in  warnings  in  the  United  States,  as  well  as  internationally.  But 
I  also  think  we  have  to  build  that  local  community  network,  those 
community leaders entrusted—those trusted information brokers in 
a community who can help. 

The CHAIRMAN. A lot of them didn’t have a public media——
Ms. SHEA. That’s right. 
The CHAIRMAN.—wireless media. 
Ms. SHEA. That’s right. And——
The  CHAIRMAN.  My  feeling  is,  maybe  we  should  assist  them  to 
get  wireless  media  so  it  will  be  there.  It  would  be  maintained  by 
the local people. You put up some warning system, someone’s going 
to forget to turn it on. 

Ms. SHEA. Yeah. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  It’s  really  providing  a  continuous  service,  in 
terms  of  some  sort  of  weather  service  or  whatever  it  might  be.  I 
should think, on a wireless basis, they would have gotten the infor-
mation much better out there. 

Ms.  SHEA.  I  think  that’s  true.  And  I  think  there  are  also  some 
fairly  low-tech  solutions  that  include  Hi–Fi  radio,  HF  radio,  and 
satellite  downlinks  in  a  wireless  way  from  warning  centers  that 
then can be rebroadcast by HF radio. That’s relatively inexpensive. 
The  other  is,  then,  combining  that  wireless  link,  the  information 
that  comes  from  the  wireless  link,  with  low-tech  capabilities  like 
warning flags or siren systems. Those two can be used without hav-
ing  to  rely  on  that  infrastructure  that  you  so  rightly  point  out  is 
not available in many of these communities. 

The CHAIRMAN. Dr. Hansen, how about using those graduate stu-
dents out there—I assume they’re still watching—why don’t you re-
view  our  proposal  to  have  this  new  Subcommittee  of  Disaster  Pre-
diction and Prevention, and ask them what they think we ought to 
go  into.  What  should  we  ask  the  Subcommittee  to  start  out  on? 
What’s the most important areas that we could look at to see where 
there  are  deficiencies  in  prediction  and  prevention?  Could  you  do 
that for us? 

Dr. HANSEN. Yes. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Dr. HANSEN. I will. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Inouye? 
Senator INOUYE. As we have demonstrated, it usually requires a 
disaster of biblical proportions to get all of us acting. For example, 
it  took  the  tsunami  disaster  in  Southeast  Asia  to  bring  about  the 
creation  of  the  Disaster  Prevention  and  Prediction  Subcommittee.

I don’t know if you have the expertise to respond, but do you be-
lieve that the bill that we are proposing, S. 50, would do what you 
believe is necessary? 

Ms.  SHEA.  Yes.  I  think  it’s  a  really  good  start.  I  think  that  if  I 
were  looking  at  S.  50,  I  might  suggest  broadening  the  education 
components of S. 50, and I also might suggest that we look at ways 
of  broadening  that  vulnerability  and  adaptation  research  compo-
nent.  And,  in  particular,  leveraging  ongoing  activities.  These  same 
communities  that  are  subject  to  tsunamis  are  also,  as  several  peo-
ple  have  mentioned  today,  subject  to  other  coastal  threats.  There 
are  other  coastal  warning  systems  out  there.  There  are  climate 
forecast  systems  out  there,  in  the  United  States  and  around  the 
world.  And  if  we  can  leverage  those,  find  those  partnerships,  we 
can make a significant advance in the receiver end of this problem 
without  an  investment  of  a  significant  amount  of  new  resources. 
It’s really about bringing those partnerships. 

Senator  INOUYE.  Would  you  favor  this  Committee  with  the 

memos carrying out those proposals? 

Ms. SHEA. Absolutely. Be happy to, Senator. Happy to. 
Senator INOUYE. It would be very helpful. 
Ms. SHEA. Great.

Chairman, 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee,

Hon. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 
Ranking Minority Member,

Dear Sirs:
Thank  you,  again,  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  last  week  on  S.  50  and  the  evo-
lution  of  an  effective  U.S.  tsunami  warning  and  preparedness  program.  As  I  men-
tioned  at  the  hearing,  I  am  honored  to  be  able  to  contribute  in  some  small  way  to 
your  efforts  to  build  more  disaster-resilient  coastal  communities  in  the  U.S.  and 
around the world. During the hearing, you asked me to provide you with some writ-
ten suggestions to strengthen S. 50, including an outline of the elements of regional 
pilot  projects  focused  on  building  the  resilience  of  coastal  communities.  By  way  of 
this letter, I am pleased to respond to that request for additional information. 

First,  I  would  like  to  reinforce  the  importance  of  setting  tsunami  warning  and 
preparedness  programs  in  a  multi-hazard,  risk  management  context  as  mentioned 
in  Section  2(a)(10)  of  S.  50.  As  we  discussed  during  the  hearing,  many  of  the  ele-
ments of a program designed to improve warnings and enhance resilience in the face 
of  low-frequency,  high  impact  events  such  as  tsunamis  will  also  make  important 
contributions to enhancing the resilience of coastal communities in the face of other 
natural hazards such as extreme weather events (floods, hurricanes, high wind and 
wave events) as well as the consequences of climate variability and change. I would 
encourage the Committee to respond to Section 2(a)(10) with a new title/section au-
thorizing  NOAA  to  work  with  other  federal  partners,  state  governments,  academia, 
the extramural research community, and the private sector to implement a Disaster-
Resilient  Coastal  Communities  Vulnerability  and  Adaptation  Program.  Such  a  pro-
gram  would  complement  and  build  on  the  tsunami-specific  hazard  mitigation  pro-
gram  called  for  in  Section  4  of  S.  50  but  would  provide  a  broader  context  in  which 
to support various activities that can help coastal communities respond to a variety 
of  hazards/threats.  Pursuant  to  your  request,  I  have  included  a  description  of  the 
key components of such an integrated program as Appendix A to this letter. 

As we discussed briefly last week, this kind of integrated vulnerability assessment 
and  adaptation  program  is  perhaps  best  implemented  on  a  regional  scale  since  one

size  does  not  fit  all  when  it  comes  to  understanding  vulnerability,  providing  useful 
and  usable  risk  assessment  information  or  developing  effective  risk  management 
strategies.  I  would  like  to  strongly  endorse  the  idea  of  initiating  this  program 
through  one  or  more  regional  pilot  projects  that  would  both  demonstrate  the  value 
of  the  integrated  programmatic  approach  described  above  and  move  quickly  to  re-
duce  the  vulnerability—enhance  the  resilience—of  coastal  communities  particularly 
at risk to tsunamis and other natural hazards such as weather and climate-related 
extreme events. 

As  I  mentioned  last  week,  I  believe  that  the  Pacific  might  be  one  such  region 
based  on  its  vulnerability  to  tsunamis,  a  dependence  on  climate-sensitive  resources 
and  sectors  such  as  fisheries,  tourism  and  agriculture;  ongoing  work  in  tsunami, 
weather and climate forecasting and assessment; and the institutional partnerships 
reflected  in  the  Pacific  Risk  Management  Ohana  (PRiMO).  Based  on  the  testimony 
of  my  colleague  from  the  University  of  Alaska,  I  believe  that  Alaska  would  be  an-
other high-priority candidate for a regional pilot program for many of the same rea-
sons. I might suggest that a third regional program might be considered for the At-
lantic seaboard with its vulnerability to coastal flooding and hurricanes. I would en-
courage  consideration  of  at  least  three  years  for  a  regional  pilot  project  along  the 
lines  described  above  with  an  eye  toward  sustaining  the  partnerships  established 
during the pilot phase. 

My  review  of  S.  50  identified  a  few  additional  specific  suggestions  for  strength-

ening the bill. I have included those suggestions in Appendix B to this letter. 

Mahalo  nui  loa  for  the  opportunity  to  provide  this  additional  information  as  you 

continue your deliberations on S. 50.

APPENDIX A 

Key Components of a Disaster-Resilient Coastal Communities Vulnerability 

and Adaptation Program 

Such a program would complement and build on the tsunami-specific hazard miti-
gation program called for in Section 4 of S. 50 but would provide a broader context 
in which to support various activities that can help coastal communities respond to 
a variety of hazards/threats. Such an integrated program might include:

• The  development  of  multi-hazard  vulnerability  maps  that  help  governments, 
businesses  and  communities  characterize  and  assess  their  current  risks  in  the 
face of a variety of natural hazards and provide a baseline for assessing future 
risks;
• Multi-disciplinary  vulnerability  assessment  research  and  dialogue  to  improve 
understanding  of  a  coastal  community’s  exposure  and  sensitivity  to  hazards  as 
well  as  providing  insights  into  adaptation  options  (policies,  engineering,  re-
source  management)  that  would  either  reduce  exposure  and  sensitivity  or  en-
hance resilience. The ultimate focus of this component of the program would be 
the  integration  of  risk  management  considerations  in  the  context  of  economic 
development and community development planning and policies. As I mentioned 
last  week,  this  will  involve  more  than  a  few,  isolated  studies  of  the  socio-
economic impacts of hazards/natural disasters. Such a program will be most ef-
fective  when  it  incorporates  a  collaborative,  participatory  approach  that  effec-
tively engages scientific and technical experts as well as policy officials and de-
cision-makers in government, businesses, academia, NGOs and community lead-
ers in a process of shared learning and joint problem solving.
• Risk  management  education  programs,  including:  (a)  technical  training  on  re-
cent  scientific  developments  in  key  hazard  areas  (e.g.,  tsunamis,  weather  ex-
tremes,  climate  variability  and  change)  and  new  technologies;  (b)  leadership 
training to enhance the cadre of individuals and institutions responsible for risk 
assessment  and  risk  management  programs;  and  (c)  formal  and  informal  edu-
cation  programs  and  materials  including  public  awareness  brochures  and  cam-
paigns as well as curriculum development;
• Risk  assessment  technology  development  including  (but  not  limited  to)  devel-
oping practical applications of the insights gained from risk perception and risk 
communication  research  as  well  as  the  provision  and  application  of  new  tools 
and technologies such as high resolution imagery and modeling, remote sensing 
and  in  situ  observations  and  imagery,  geospatial  (GIS)  technology,  innovative 
uses  of  current  and  planned  observing  systems  and  model-based  decision  sup-
port tools;

79

• Risk management data and information services including: (a) access to observa-
tional data and derived products from relevant observing systems including, but 
not  limited  to  the  tsunami  observing  system  of  buoys  and  tide  gauges  author-
ized in S. 50 as well as the weather, climate and hazard/risk management com-
ponents of regional and global observing systems (e.g., the Integrated Ocean Ob-
serving System, the Global Climate Observing System and the Global Environ-
mental Observations System of Systems); (b) developing and maintaining multi-
disciplinary  data  sets  on  the  nature  and  consequences  of  key  hazards;  and  (c) 
development  and  provision  of  new,  integrated  data  products  that  support  risk 
assessment and risk management programs; and
• Risk  communication  systems  that  build  on  existing  warning  and  forecast  sys-
tems  such  as  the  expanded  tsunami  warning  system  called  for  in  S.  50  as  well 
as ongoing weather, climate and ocean monitoring and forecasting systems. This 
component of the program would also provide a focus for exploring the applica-
bility of a variety of communications tools and technologies as well as the devel-
opment  of  the  social  network  of  individuals  and  institutions  involved  in  risk/
hazard warning, response and recovery.

This  kind  of  integrated  vulnerability  assessment  and  adaptation  program  is  per-
haps  best  implemented  on  a  regional  scale  since  one  size  does  not  fit  all  when  it 
comes  to  understanding  vulnerability,  providing  useful  and  usable  risk  assessment 
information  or  developing  effective  risk  management  strategies.  Criteria  for  identi-
fying appropriate regional pilot projects in the context of S. 50 might include:

ards;

• Vulnerability  to  tsunamis  as  well  as  weather,  climate  and  other  coastal  haz-
• Dependence  on  economic  sectors  and  natural  resources  that  are  particularly 
sensitive  to  coastal  hazards  such  as  coastal  inundation  as  well  as  weather  and 
climate-related  extreme  events  such  as  hurricanes,  floods,  and  high  wave 
events;
• Opportunities to link to and leverage related ongoing regional risk observation, 
research,  forecasting,  assessment,  education  and  risk  management  programs 
such  as:  the  Pacific  Risk  Management  Ohana  (PRiMO)  and/or  the  Alaska  Tsu-
nami  Preparedness  Program  discussed  during  the  February  2  hearing;  NOAA’s 
Regional  Integrated  Science  and  Assessment  (RISA)  program  which  focuses  on 
climate-related  risk  management;  regional  coastal  ocean  observing  system  pro-
grams  in  support  of  the  U.S.  Integrated  Ocean  Observing  System  (IOOS);  and 
state  coastal  zone  management  programs  with  strong  hazards/risk  reduction 
components;
• Evidence  of  strong,  interagency  collaboration  in  the  area  of  risk  management; 
• Access  to  NOAA  and  other  federal  agency  programs,  facilities  and  infrastruc-
ture in tsunami and other coastal hazards monitoring, warning, forecasting, re-
search, assessment and data management.

and

I  would  encourage  the  Committee  to  consider  funding  such  regional  pilot  pro-
grams  for  a  three-to-five  year  period  with  annual  funding  levels  reaching  approxi-
mately $1M. 

Additional Specific Suggestions to Strengthen S. 50

APPENDIX B 

The  following  specific  suggestions  to  further  strengthen  S.  50  are  also  offered  for 

your consideration:

risk assessment to support the development of effective response strategies;

• Add  to  the  end  of  Section  2(a)(l0)  ‘‘and  a  sustained  program  of  education  and 
• In Section 7, Global Tsunami Warning and Mitigation Network, explicitly iden-
tify and authorize expanded support for the International Tsunami Information 
Center which NOAA hosts as part of the UNESCO/IOC tsunami program;
• Also  in  Section  7,  I  would  encourage  you  to  authorize  NOAA  to  contribute  to 
international  tsunami  education  and  vulnerability  and  adaptation  programs  as 
well as the detection equipment and technical advice already included in S. 50;
• Consider combining the discussion of ‘‘Transfer of Technology, Maintenance and 
Upgrades’’ that currently comprises Section 3(d) with the ‘‘Tsunami System Up-
grade and Modernization’’ provisions of Section 6 under Section 3;
• More  explicitly  call  out  the  importance  of  engaging  state  coastal  zone  manage-

ment programs in the implementation of S. 50; and

80

• Include a section on data management to authorize expanded support for efforts 
by  NOAA  to  support  the  data  management  requirements  associated  with  the 
expanded observing system called for in S. 50.

In the context of this latter item, I might suggest inclusion of a new subsection—
possibly under Section 3, Tsunami Detection and Warning Systems—that would au-
thorize  and  direct  NOAA  to  support  the  data  management  requirements  associated 
with the Tsunami Detection and Warning System called for in S. 50. From my per-
spective, these requirements would include:

• Quality control and quality assurance for the ocean observation and geophysical 

data from the tsunami detection and monitoring system;

• Archiving  and  maintaining  ocean  observation  data  from  the  tsunami  detection 

and monitoring system;

• Supporting  the  integration  of  ocean  observations  from  the  tsunami  detection 
and monitoring system with other national and international water level meas-
urements such as the Global Sea Level Monitoring System (GLOSS);

• Supporting  the  integration  of  ocean  observations  from  the  tsunami  detection 
and  monitoring  system  with  other  elements  of  the  global  and  coastal  compo-
nents  of  the  Integrated  Ocean  Observing  System  (IOOS)  and  the  Global  Envi-
ronmental Observing System of Systems (GEOSS); and

• Supporting  the  development  of  and  access  to  data  sets  and  integrated  data 
products  designed  to  support  multi-hazard  regional  vulnerability  assessment 
and adaptation programs such as those called for in Titlell.

In  addition  to  national  data  centers  such  as  NODC,  NGDC  and  NCDC,  NOAA 
should look to regional data centers like the NOAA Integrated Environmental Appli-
cations and Information Center (NIEAIC) in Honolulu, HI to fulfill the requirements 
described in this section.

Senator  INOUYE.  Dr.  Cox,  this  Committee  has  heard  that  Japan 
has  already  developed  buildings,  in  place  and  operational,  for  tsu-
nami purposes. Have you heard about them? 

Dr. COX. Yes, sir. 
Senator INOUYE. Are they working? 
Dr.  COX.  To  my  knowledge,  they’re  working.  But  I  think  that—
if  I  could  just  continue  that—I  think  the—how  many  people  you 
could  put  into  the  building  versus,  you  know,  getting  people  to 
higher  ground,  I—I  mean,  I  can’t  speak  for  the  United  States,  but 
I  think  we  have  to  consider  whether  or  not  we  have  a—sort  of,  a 
high  concentration  of  people  in  a  particular  area,  let’s  say  at  a  re-
sort  community  or  something  like  that,  then  I  think  such  a  build-
ing might make sense. I think other times we have to consider just 
evacuating  everybody  to  higher  ground.  I  think  we  heard  earlier 
that  we  can’t  have,  sort  of,  a  one-size-fits-all  policy,  but  I  think 
sometimes it may make sense to build tsunami-resistant structures 
in high-density places like a resort community. 

Senator  INOUYE.  Dr.  Hansen,  I  think  statistics  indicate  that  the 
State of Alaska is more prone than any other state to earthquakes 
and  tsunamis.  Are  you  satisfied  that  the  warning  system  we  have 
today is sufficient? 

Dr.  HANSEN.  No,  I’m  not.  I  believe  that  it’s  insufficient  in  ways 
of  getting  the  information  out  to  the  local  communities.  We’re——

Senator INOUYE. How would you——
Dr. HANSEN.—in need of improving that. 
Senator INOUYE.—improve that? 
Dr.  HANSEN.  Right  now,  we’re  trying  to  establish—we’re  trying 
to  exercise  our  established  partnership  to  get  out  education  and 
outreach  programs.  We  visit  communities.  We’ve  put  together  vid-
eos to help educate the populations of Alaska about the tsunami in

our  state.  In  addition,  we’re  trying  to  work  with  leveraged  moneys 
from  the  National  Hazard  Program  and  the  university  program  to 
get  sirens  put  out  that  have  been  developed  under  this—the  Na-
tional Program. Sirens then need to be triggered somehow, and so, 
we’re working with the NOAA Tsunami Warning Center to put to-
gether  the  infrastructure  we’ll  need  to  get  out  to  communities 
where,  say,  NOAA  Weather  Wire  doesn’t  work,  or  it  doesn’t  work 
very  well,  and  improve  that  infrastructure  to  get  information  out 
beyond just the local manager, but to the people that are in danger. 
Senator  INOUYE.  Ever  since  the  end  of  World  War  II,  the  State 
of Hawaii has maintained an air-raid siren system, and it blows off 
once  a  month,  and  some  of  the  tourists  go  berserk,  not  knowing 
whether it’s a bombing attack or tsunami, but it serves a little pur-
pose. 

Ms. Shea, do you think it works? 
Ms.  SHEA.  Oh,  absolutely.  I  think  that  for  low-frequency  events, 
like  tsunamis,  I  think  we  tend  to  forget—the  population  tends  to 
forget,  in  the  long  period  of  time.  But  I  think  it’s  useful  in  the 
sense  that  when  we  hear  it,  in  Hawaii,  and  we  know  that  what  it 
means is, if it’s the first Monday of the month, we know it’s a test. 
And if it’s not the first Monday of the month, then we know there’s 
something  to  be  concerned  about,  and  then  we  do  turn  to  the  tele-
vision,  the  radio,  call  the  local  agencies,  call  the  State  Civil  De-
fense.  So  it  absolutely  does  work.  Those  low-technology  but  high-
impact systems are really quite effective. 

Senator  INOUYE.  Oftentimes,  when  we  venture  into  something 
that’s  complex  and  new,  we  set  up  pilot  programs.  Do  you  think  a 
pilot program would work in this situation? 

Ms.  SHEA.  I  think  it  would.  I  think  pilot  programs  would  be,  in 
fact,  very  useful.  And  I  think—again,  look  for  those  opportunities 
where  you  have  areas  at  high  risk—Alaska,  the  Pacific  comes  to 
mind  in  the  case  of  tsunami—and  also  those  areas  where  you’re 
built—where  these  partnerships  of  other—of  agencies  working  to-
gether  already  exist.  And  I  think—so  I  think  that—I  think  we’ve 
heard  enough  testimony  today  to  suggest  that  there  are  probably 
a couple of places, at least, where a pilot project could demonstrate 
that  partnership,  demonstrate  the  different  kinds  of  technology, 
and  demonstrate  the  value  of  building  this  comprehensive  risk-
management information system. 

Senator INOUYE. See, we have no idea what the costs will be, and 

a pilot program might be helpful. 

Ms. SHEA. Yes. 
Senator INOUYE. Can members of the panel provide us with your 

ideas of what, if any, the pilot program should look like? 

Ms. SHEA. Absolutely. 
Senator INOUYE. I would appreciate that. 
Dr. COX. Yes, thank you. 
Senator INOUYE. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
And,  Dr.  Hansen,  I  think  I’m  indebted  to  you  for  this,  a  copy  of 
‘‘Ocean  Fury:  Tsunamis  in  Alaska.’’  Let  me  read  to  the  Senator, 
what  this  says.  It  says,  ‘‘Future  tsunamis  will  hit  Alaska.  Taking 
its  cue  from  the  survivors  of  1964,  this  program  explains  how  sci-
entists,  local  officials,  and  emergency  responders  are  working  to-

gether  to  reduce  the  loss  of  life  and  property  when  tsunamis  as-
sault  Alaska’s  coast  again.  With  the  aid  of  3D  computer  graphics, 
scientists  describe  how  different  kinds  of  tsunamis  form,  how  they 
can travel at jetliner speeds, sometimes striking shorelines with lit-
tle  or  no  time  to  escape.  More  important,  this  program  describes 
what  you  should  do  to  improve  your  chances  of  surviving  the  next 
tsunami.’’

I hope, Dr. Hansen, you’ve provided a copy of this to every school 

in the state. 

Dr.  HANSEN.  The  emergency  management  group  is  doing  that 

kind of thing, that’s exactly right. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  That  should  be  a  program  that  all  young  people 
should  look  at  so  they  can  understand  there’s  something  out  there 
to prepare for. 

We  thank  you  very  much.  You  demonstrate  that  this  a  issue  of 
substantial  concern  to  where  we  come  from,  the  two  of  us,  and  we 
appreciate you—have you got another copy? I’ll give that to Senator 
Inouye. 

Dr. HANSEN. I don’t with me, but I can get you one. 
The CHAIRMAN. One of those graduate students will mail me one. 
[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  We  do  thank  you  very  much  for  taking  the  time 
to come here. It’s very important. This is our first hearing. The two 
of  us,  as  Co–Chairmen  of  this  Commerce  Committee,  we  wanted 
everyone  to  understand  this  is  going  to  be  one  of  our  number-one 
targets,  to  really  deal  with  prevention  and  detection  of  disasters. 

Thank you very much. 
[Whereupon, at 12:15 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

A P P E N D I X

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. BARBARA BOXER, U.S. SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA 
Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  holding  this  hearing  today.  The  December  26th  In-

dian Ocean Tsunami was a terrible tragedy. 

The sheer devastation inflicted by the tsunami reminds us all how vulnerable our 
coastlines are to widespread damage. In California, this is a serious threat because 
we  are  home  to  miles  of  beautiful  coastal  communities,  well  within  reach  of  poten-
tial damage caused by tsunamis. 

Californians have confronted tsunamis in the past. On March 28, 1964, a tsunami 
originating from an earthquake near Alaska hit the Northern California community 
of Crescent City, killing 10 people, and damaging 91 homes and 197 businesses. The 
power of this tsunami was so intense, large buildings in Crescent City were uplifted 
by the force of the waves. 

The  Cape  Mendocino  earthquake  in  1992  created  a  tsunami  that  wreaked  havoc 
along  California’s  northern  coastline.  Thankfully,  there  were  no  deaths,  but  the 
1992 tsunami highlights the need for notification of a tsunami as well as public out-
reach efforts. 

One of the many lessons learned from the 1964 and 1992 tsunamis was that prop-
er  warning  and  evacuation  truly  saves  lives.  First,  we  need  to  ensure  there  are 
enough  buoys  to  protect  the  California  coast  from  tsunamis.  Currently,  only  three 
out of the six buoys deployed in the Pacific Ocean are functional. 

Second, coastal communities need adequate funding so that they can become tsu-
nami  ready.  Since  the  time  of  the  1964  tsunami,  Crescent  City  has  made  tremen-
dous  strides  to  protect  its  residents  by  implementing  tsunami  emergency  plans,  in-
stalling  warning  sirens,  and  creating  a  tsunami  education  program.  As  a  result, 
Crescent City has been honored by NOAA as a TsunamiReady community. 

However,  much  more  is  needed  to  make  sure  all  of  our  coastal  communities  are 

as well prepared as Crescent City is today. 

After consulting with the California Office of Emergency Services (OES), my staff 
has been informed that California is in dire need of more funding that will help map 
potential inundation zones, and that will help educate the public. 

According  to  OES,  only  $88,000  in  federal  funding  is  given  annually  for  tsunami 
evaluation and preparation in California’s 15 coastal communities, and only two are 
TsunamiReady  by  NOAA  standards.  Tsunami  taskforces  in  California  have  said 
they  need  more  money  to  erect  warning  signs  on  county  beaches,  plan  evacuation 
routes, and conduct public outreach efforts. 

Mr. Chairman, we must do more to ensure that our citizens living near the coast 
are  well-educated  and  better  prepared  to  deal  with  a  tsunami,  and  our  emergency 
officials have the necessary funding to achieve this goal. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DOUG CARLSON, HONOLULU, HAWAII 

Mr. Chairman, it is highly probable that tens of thousands of people died around 
the Indian Ocean rim on December 26, 2004 because an agency of the United States 
Government  was  unprepared  to  issue  an  effective  tsunami  warning  to  the  region’s 
population.  This  inference  can  be  made  with  great  certainty  based  on  the  public 
record and the statements of numerous Federal Government employees. 

The  warning  failure  occurred  even  though  Pacific  Tsunami  Warning  Center 
(PTWC)  scientists  first  suspected  the  existence  of  the  tsunami  as  much  as  two-
thirds of an hour before the first waves struck Sri Lanka, India and Thailand. That 
is  clearly  established  in  the  tsunami  timeline  by  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmos-
pheric Administration. (Ref: http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2004/s2358.htm) 

It’s  true  that  scientists  did  not  initially  know  that  a  9.0  magnitude  earthquake 
had  struck  near  Indonesia.  They  first  calculated  the  magnitude  at  8.0,  which  they 
felt would have triggered only a localized tsunami or no tsunami at all.

Others may wish to investigate the too-low estimate of the earthquake’s strength 
with  a  goal  of  improving  early  forecasting  techniques.  The  intent  of  my  testimony, 
however,  is  to  demonstrate  that  the  communications  protocols  that  existed  on  De-
cember 26 were inadequate to issue an effective warning and that U.S. officials may 
not  have  been  sufficiently  trained  or  sensitized  to  the  importance  of  calling  on  the 
news media for assistance. 

We know from numerous media interviews with the scientists that about an hour 
after  the  earthquake  they  felt  a  need  to  alert  people  in  the  Indian  Ocean  region 
about  a  possible  tsunami.  We  also  know  that  they  felt  handicapped  by  the  absence 
of a high-tech tsunami detection and alert-dissemination system in the region. Noth-
ing around the Indian Ocean approximates the sophistication of the Pacific Rim tsu-
nami warning network. 

To their credit, the Center’s personnel wanted to take some kind of action to alert 
the region. According to the Center’s director, as quoted in The International Herald 
Tribune: ‘‘We wanted to try to do something, but without a plan in place then, it was 
not  an  effective  way  to  issue  a  warning,  or  to  have  it  acted  upon.’’  (Ref:  http://
www.iht.com/articles/2004/12/28/news/warning.html) 

Without a notification plan, the scientists resorted to telephoning their colleagues 
in  south  Asia,  with  virtually  no  success.  What  they  did  not  do  was  telephone  the 
major international news media, such as the Associated Press, CNN, the BBC, Reu-
ters  or  any  other  news  organization  with  world-wide  communications  capabilities. 
In  other  words,  in  the  41  minutes  between  issuing  a  bulletin  that  mentioned  a 
possible  tsunami  and  when  the  first  waves  are  now  thought  to  have  reached  Sri 
Lanka,  the  scientists  used  the  telephone  to  call  one  person  at  a  time  rather  than 
call the mass media to help issue a warning through their broadcast and cable net-
works. 

A  NOAA  spokesperson  later  gave  what  may  be  the  most  telling  comment  about 
the  PTWC’s  crisis  communications  preparedness:  ‘‘Not  only  was  the  center  focused 
on  warning  agencies,  it  does  not  have  an  official  list  of  media  contacts.’’  (Ref:
http://www.washtimes.com/upi-breaking/20050107–050909–7208r.htm) 

Would  alerting  the  news  media  in  those  first  critical  minutes  have  made  a  dif-
ference in how many people died in south Asia? With proper planning and coordina-
tion of media protocols, I’m certain lives could have been saved. 

And I’m not alone. Many others around the world have questioned the lack of an 
effective  warning.  A  woman  in  Sri  Lanka  who  lost  her  father,  sister  and  niece  was 
interviewed by National Public Radio: ‘‘Why didn’t we receive warning? We had two 
hours after Indonesian quake, and at least five minutes warning would have helped. 
Five minutes would have saved my father’s life.’’ (Ref: http://www.npr.org/templates/
story/story.php?storyId=4277/95) 

On  January  11,  the  day  NOAA’s  administrator  visited  the  PTWC  and  met  with 
the  Honolulu  news  media,  I  posted  questions  on  my  web  log  site  that  I  felt  might 
well be directed to him. They are still relevant today:

ings?

a place in your pre-crisis planning and emergency warning protocols?

• Will  NOAA  release  the  PTWC’s  crisis  communications  plan?  (If  not,  why  not?)
• What  liaison  did  NOAA  accomplish  with  the  major  media  (Associated  Press, 
CNN,  BBC,  etc.)  before  12/26  to  ensure  emergency  phone  calls  to  these  media 
would produce timely warnings to their audiences?
• Are  PTWC  scientists  trained  to  telephone  the  media  to  issue  life-saving  warn-
• Is the PTWC too high-tech oriented? Do you think low-tech telephone calls have 
• Have  you  ordered  changes  in  the  PTWC  warning  protocols  since  the  tsunami?
• Does  NOAA  accept  responsibility  for  an  internal  procedural  failure  that  might 
• What is NOAA telling south Asia nations about its performance on 12/26?
• What are your personal feelings about NOAA’s performance on 12/26?
The  administrator  did  answer  many  media  questions  that  day,  including  a  vari-
ation  of  the  last  one.  According  to  the  Honolulu  Star-Bulletin,  he  called  the  PTWC 
staff’s  actions  ‘‘excellent’’  and  faithful  to  the  warning  procedures  in  place.  ‘‘This  is 
a  group  that  believes  in  saving  lives  and  protecting  property  at  all  costs,’’  he  said. 
(Ref: http://starbulletin.com/2005/01/12/news/index1.html) 

have cost the lives of tens of thousands of people in South Asia?

The  sad  fact  is  the  ‘‘warning  procedures  in  place’’  on  December  26  saved  no  lives 
and  protected  no  property.  Nothing  PTWC  scientists  knew  or  did  that  day  helped 
people in the tsunami danger zone. 

I  respectfully  submit  to  this  Committee  that  the  PTWC’s  apparent  inability  to 
issue  effective  warnings  is  unacceptable.  I  have  proposed  a  five-point  program  that

would help NOAA shift its thinking and its culture to include meaningful media no-
tification after future tsunami-generating earthquakes:

could have undertaken likely would have saved lives in south Asia.

• NOAA  should  accept  constructive  criticism—rather  than  deny—that  actions  it 
• NOAA  should  resolve  to  change  its  communications  culture  to  include  reevalu-
ating  the  scope  of  its  information-disseminating  mission—i.e.,  whether  its  mis-
sion extends beyond the Pacific Rim.
• NOAA  should  rewrite  its  communications  protocols  to  include  early  telephone 
calls  to  news  organizations  that  have  the  capability  of  sending  worldwide  tsu-
nami warnings.
• NOAA should accomplish high-level coordination with the management of these 
news  agencies  to  ensure  proper  execution  of  the  alerts  when  received  by  the 
media.
• NOAA  should  train  its  personnel  to  respond  to  suspected  tsunamis  by  making 
direct  person-to-person  contact  with  major  news  outlets  based  on  prior  plan-
ning.

The  media  can  be  an  efficient  way  to  send  warnings  to  threatened  populations 
when  time  is  of  the  essence,  and  NOAA  would  do  well  to  integrate  them  into  its 
crisis communications planning. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to your 
deliberations on this important matter. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO

BRIGADIER GENERAL JOHN J. KELLY 

Failure of DART Buoys and Long Term Tsunami Funding Needs 

General  Kelly,  in  your  testimony,  you  noted  the  failure  of  three  of  the  six  Deep-
Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami (DART) buoys used to detect tsunami 
in  the  event  of  an  earthquake.  As  you  know,  these  buoys  are  extremely  important 
to  our  coastal  communities,  both  in  detecting  tsunami  that  pose  a  threat  to  these 
communities,  and  in  preventing  expensive  evacuations  by  detecting  false  alarms.  I 
am  concerned  that  these  problems  have  existed  for  over  15  months  and  Congress 
is just now learning of this situation. 

Had there been a devastating tsunami in the Pacific this December, instead of in 
the  Indian  Ocean,  and  we  found  out  3  of  the  DART  buoys  were  down,  this  hearing 
would  have  a  very  different  tone.  We  would  like  to  avoid  ever  having  such  a  situa-
tion arise. 

Question 1. What are NOAA’s plans for instituting better oversight procedures to 

ensure that contractors are meeting the specifications of the system? 

Answer. NOAA has existing procedures in place to ensure contractor performance 
meets the specifications of the DART station. The quality of work by the contractors 
is  not  a  reason  for  buoy  failure.  Buoys  can  fail  for  a  variety  of  reasons  related  to 
technology, mechanical or mooring systems.

Question 1a. When can we expect all six DART buoys to be operational again? 
Answer. One of the three buoys is now operational, and once the weather permits, 
NOAA  is  ready  to  repair  the  other  two.  We  expect  all  6  DART  stations  to  be  oper-
ational  by  summer  2005,  and  we  will  follow  our  maintenance  schedule  to  ensure 
they  remain  functional.  While  it  is  not  possible  to  guarantee  that  these  prototype 
stations  will  be  operational  100  percent  of  the  time,  NOAA  is  focused  on  making 
the DART network more robust.

Question  1b.  Will  you  notify  Congress  in  a  timely  fashion  if  other  failures  occur? 
Answer. For any outages of longer than 60 days, NOAA will notify the Committee 
of  the  status  of  the  network.  Additionally,  the  Committee  can  visit  the  National 
Data  Buoy  Center  website  for  up-to-date  information  on  the  status  of  the  DART 
buoys (http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/dart.shtml).

Question  1c.  How  will  you  ensure  these  buoys—and  the  new  buoys—are  serviced 

regularly and stay in operational condition? 

Answer.  NOAA  will  ensure  all  DART  stations  are  serviced  regularly  to  ensure 
operational  condition  to  the  greatest  extent  possible.  NOAA  plans  for  the  network 
to  meet  operational  requirements,  even  with  occasional  DART  station  outages. 
NOAA will develop capabilities to address network coverage and redundancy to en-
sure, as best we can, that single DART station failures will not impact the integrity 
of  the  entire  network.  Planned  redundancy  and  hardening  of  the  infrastructure, 
combined  with  the  addition  of  a  two-way  communication  capability,  will  mitigate 
risk  from  system-wide  failures.  In  addition  to  these  measures,  NOAA  is  also  pro-

86

curing  three  redundant  DART  buoys  for  the  Alaska  DART  buoy  array  and  will  ac-
quire  10  spare  DART  buoys  as  part  of  expansion  of  the  tsunami  warning  system 
in  FY  2005  and  FY  2006.  These  spare  buoys  will  ensure  that  NOAA  can  rapidly 
respond  to  buoy  failure.  As  the  expanded  network  is  transitioned  from  a  prototype 
to a fully operational network, NOAA will inform Congress of any outages impacting 
the integrity of the network as a whole.

Question  2.  Funding.  The  President  has  committed  $37.5  million  over  the  next 
two years (through the end of Fiscal Year 2006) to expand the tsunami warning sys-
tem.  Of  that  funding,  how  much  will  go  towards  (1)  inundation  mapping  for  all 
coastal  communities;  (2)  continued  technology  research  and  development  for  next 
generation  equipment  and  forecasting;  and  (3)  public  education  to  ensure  our  com-
munities are prepared? 

Answer.  Of  the  $24M  scheduled  for  NOAA  use,  approximately  $4.75M  will  be 
spent on inundation mapping and modeling, as well as education and outreach (e.g., 
community  preparedness  activities  including  TsunamiReady).  Of  this  $4.75M,  ap-
proximately  $2.25M  will  be  spent  on  inundation  mapping  and  modeling  and  $2.5M 
will  go  towards  public  education  activities.  Following  the  current  plan,  inundation 
mapping  for  the  major  population  centers  will  be  complete  in  2015.  Of  the  $24M 
scheduled  for  NOAA  use,  approximately  $1.0M  will  be  directed  to  support  Deep-
ocean  Assessment  and  Reporting  of  Tsunamis  (DART)  buoy  research  and  develop-
ment activities.

Question  2a.  What  are  the  out-year  costs  (beyond  Fiscal  Year  2006)  of  maintain-
ing  in  working  order  the  entire  expanded  detection  system,  and  the  associated  tsu-
nami programs? 

Answer.  By  the  middle  of  calendar  year  2007,  NOAA  expects  to  fully  deploy  the 
new  suite  of  DART  stations,  to  continue  accelerated  inundation  mapping  and  mod-
eling  activities,  and  to  continue  accelerated  community  preparedness  activities. 
NOAA  anticipates  additional  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  to  maintain 
the expanded detection network in working order, as well as continued costs for ef-
forts in tsunami inundation mapping and education/outreach programs. The level of 
funding  required  beyond  FY  2006  will  be  determined  through  the  budget  process.
Agency  Participation  in  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program 
Question 3. Both you and Ms. Shea have provided testimony about the importance 
of  interagency  cooperation  in  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program, 
specifically  cooperation  among  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administra-
tion  (NOAA),  the  United  States  Geological  Survey  (USGS),  the  National  Science 
Foundation (NSF), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). I have 
some questions about FEMA’s role in the program. 

In 1996, the Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Federal/State Working Group presented 
its  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Implementation  Plan  to  the  Senate  Appropriations 
Committee.  In  this  plan,  FEMA  was  given  responsibilities  to  produce  inundation 
and  evacuation  maps,  and  to  implement  state  and  local  tsunami  mitigation  pro-
grams. The Implementation Plan called for over $2.2 million in funding from FEMA 
to carry out these responsibilities—including mapping and mitigation. 

How  much  funding  or  in-kind  work  has  FEMA  contributed  to  this  interagency 
program since 1996? How does this compare with the other federal and state agency 
contributions? 

Answer.  Under  the  original  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program 
(NTHMP), FEMA responsibilities were limited to the mitigation and implementation 
of  the  mapping.  While  the  original  plan  may  have  called  for  FEMA  funding,  under 
the NTHMP there was no funding made available for FEMA. 

Up until last year, FEMA contribution to the NTHMP has primarily been in-kind 
support.  This  includes  the  support  of  two  FEMA  Regional  staff  members  who  have 
been members of the NTHMP Mitigation committee since its inception. At least one 
regional  staff  person  has  spent  25  percent  of  her  time  on  the  tsunami  hazard  over 
a 10-year period. A rough estimate of staff time and travel over this time is approxi-
mately  $200,000.  In  addition,  one  FEMA  Headquarters  scientist  has  also  been  in-
volved in this committee as a technical liaison for several years. 

As  described  in  further  detail  in  question  3b,  for  the  first  three  years  of  the 
NTHMP, FEMA was the distribution agency for the NOAA state grant funding. This 
was  done  since  NOAA  did  not  have  a  mechanism  to  transfer  funds  to  the  states, 
while FEMA did. While the actual funds came from NOAA, this activity did require 
significant staff resources on the part of FEMA. 

Also described in further detail in question 3a, FEMA jointly co-funded a $400,000 
project  with  NOAA  to  study  and  develop  tsunami  shelter  design  guidance.  This 
project  builds  on  a  first  phase,  which  involved  a  five-state  engineer  concept  feasi-

bility workshop funded by NOAA and led by the State of Washington and the identi-
fication  of  existing  guidance  material.  The  project  will  work  with  the  engineering 
community and the states to research and produce the construction design guidance 
for  a  tsunami  shelter  structure  capable  of  withstanding  both  the  severe  ground 
shaking expected during a design earthquake and specific velocities and water pres-
sure that a tsunami will bring to bear on structures. The product will be especially 
useful to low-lying communities that lack evacuation access to high ground following 
a  local  great  earthquake  and  that  may  have  to  rely  on  vertical  evacuation  in  exist-
ing buildings. 

FEMA  has  also  jointly  funded  66  percent  of  a  $412,000  pilot  project  through  its 
National  Flood  Insurance  Program  (NFIP)  with  NOAA  and  the  USGS  to  develop 
risk identification products that will help communities understand their actual level 
of risk from tsunami in a way that could be conveyed on FEMA’s existing flood haz-
ard maps. The goal of the project is to develop techniques that can be used to deter-
mine the probability and magnitude of tsunami in other communities along the west 
coast  of  the  United  States.  The  location  of  the  pilot  project  is  Seaside,  Oregon. 
FEMA’s  NFIP  is  involved  because  FEMA  is  responsible  for  mapping  areas  subject 
to flooding in order to properly rate flood insurance policies and provide risk assess-
ment information to states and local communities. 

In  addition,  it  should  be  noted  that  FEMA’s  NFIP  has  considered  tsunami  wave 
heights  during  the  development  of  its  Flood  Insurance  Rate  Maps  since  the  late 
1970’s for areas of Hawaii and the West Coast where tsunami was considered a sig-
nificantly  probable  flood  threat.  The  NFIP  flood  maps  still  reflect  tsunami  wave 
heights  for  areas  such  as  Hawaii  where  inundation  heights  from  that  hazard  are 
considered that most probable form of flooding. 

Other  federal  agencies  that  participate  in  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitiga-
tion Program (NTHMP) include NOAA, which has contributed approximately $27M, 
and  USGS.  The  five  states  participating  in  the  NTHMP  (Alaska,  Hawaii,  Wash-
ington,  Oregon,  and  California)  have  contributed  a  total  of  $5.0M  in  in-kind  con-
tributions since FY 1997.

Question  3a.  Has  NOAA  transferred  funds  to  FEMA  in  order  for  the  agency  to 

perform any work for the program? Please explain. 

Answer. There are two instances of NOAA transferring funds to FEMA to perform 
work  under  the  program.  First,  as  mentioned  above,  was  that  for  the  first  three 
years NOAA transferred the state grant funds to FEMA, who then distributed those 
funds through our existing State Emergency Management Preparedness Grant pro-
gram.  FEMA  did  not  receive  any  compensation  for  managing  this  activity.  NOAA 
subsequently  took  over  this  function  and  has  been  distributing  the  state  grants  di-
rectly. 

Second, also mentioned above, FEMA and NOAA jointly funded a project to deter-
mine  if  it  is  possible  to  design  and  build  a  structure  to  withstand  specific  tsunami 
loads  and,  if  so,  to  develop  technical  design  and  construction  guidance  for  special 
shelter facilities that would allow for vertical evacuation. Funding for this two-year 
$400,000 effort is equally divided between FEMA, through the National Earthquake 
Hazards  Reduction  Program  (NEHRP),  and  NOAA,  through  the  NTHMP.  The 
project will produce construction design guidance for a tsunami shelter structure ca-
pable  of  withstanding  both  the  severe  ground  shaking  expected  during  a  design 
earthquake  and  specific  velocities  and  water  pressure  from  a  tsunami  that  would 
impact structures. This is a significant challenge since current design practice takes 
into account earthquake or coastal storm surge but does not address stronger forces 
that a tsunami would generate. The project, which is being done under contract, was 
initiated last fall and is just getting underway. 

A  potential  future  phase  of  this  project  may  include  developing  information  for 
states  and  local  communities  on  how  this  tsunami  shelter  design  guidance  can  be 
utilized. This information would especially be critical for low-lying communities that 
lack  evacuation  access  to  high  ground  following  a  local  earthquake  and  that  may 
have  to  rely  on  vertical  evacuation.  Future  funding  would  be  equally  divided  be-
tween NOAA and FEMA.

Question 3b. Given that FEMA’s priorities have shifted from natural disaster miti-
gation  to  preparing  and  responding  to  terror  attacks,  how  much  funding  and  effort 
can FEMA reasonably be expected to contribute in the post-9/11 environment? 

Answer. Although the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is focused on ter-
rorism and protecting the homeland, it is also committed to an all-hazards approach 
of  preparedness  for,  response  to,  recovery  from,  and  mitigation  against  all  events, 
including natural disasters. Recent efforts to improve response to and recovery from 
a  terrorism  event  does  not  diminish  FEMA’s  commitment  to  dealing  with  the  de-
struction of a natural disaster—just the opposite. FEMA has enjoyed a long history

88

of  focusing  on  an  all-hazards  approach,  and  being  part  of  DHS  has  strengthened 
that  approach.  FEMA  has  successfully  continued  to  respond  to  and  recover  from  a 
multitude of natural disasters in the past year. At the same time, these efforts pro-
vide  FEMA  with  opportunities  not  only  to  better  prepare  for  terrorism  events,  but 
also for catastrophic events, whether they are natural or caused by terrorism.

Question 3c. What financial burden does this place on NOAA, as the primary fed-

eral partner, as well as on the states? 

Answer.  FEMA’s  participation  has  not  placed  any  financial  burdens  on  NOAA. 

NOAA is not in a position to comment on financial burden placed on the states. 
Tsunami and Earthquake Program Compatability 

Question  4.  As  you  may  know,  Congress  recently  enacted  this  Committee’s  reau-
thorization  of  the  multi-agency  National  Earthquake  Hazards  Reduction  Program 
(NEHRP),  which  is  aimed  at  both  improving  earthquake  detection  and  community 
resilience  to  earthquakes—including  building  construction  and  planning  guidelines. 
Similarly, S. 50, would authorize NOAA’s National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Pro-
gram  (NTHMP),  another  multi-agency  program  involving  many  of  the  witnesses 
here today. 

Looking at these two programs together, are the activities of the Earthquake pro-
gram consistent with the goals of the Tsunami program? For instance, is a building 
designed  to  be  earthquake  resilient  also  designed  to  be  resilient  against  tsunami? 
Answer.  The  National  Earthquake  Hazard  Reduction  Program  (NEHRP)  activi-
ties,  under  the  leadership  of  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology 
(NIST),  are  consistent  with  those  of  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Pro-
gram. NEHRP operates the Global Seismographic Network and the National Earth-
quake Information Center, which provide data essential to the tsunami warning sys-
tem.  Currently,  buildings  designed  to  be  earthquake  resilient  are  not  also  designed 
to  be  resilient  against  tsunamis.  NEHRP  has  a  nascent  effort  to  develop  tsunami 
hazard  maps  and  design  criteria  for  shelters  and  critical  facilities  in  cooperation 
with  the  Tsunami  program.  While  it  would  not  be  economically  feasible  to  build  a 
typical  structure  to  withstand  a  tsunami,  NEHRP  believes  that  structures  could  be 
designed to withstand at least some specific level of tsunami without collapse. This 
is especially important for buildings such as community shelters or critical facilities 
(e.g., hospitals).

Question  4a.  Does  the  Earthquake  Program  have  any  programs  or  approaches 
that  should  be  adopted  by  the  Tsunami  program?  For  example,  should  we  expand 
programs regarding construction and planning? 

Answer.  The  Administration  has  recently  proposed  significant  expansion  of  the 
National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program.  The  primary  goal  of  this  proposed 
expansion  is  to  develop  and  maintain  a  fully  operational  tsunami  warning  system. 
While construction practices may be of interest, our efforts are currently focused on 
improving our Nation’s tsunami warning capabilities.

Question  4b.  Has  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA)  partici-
pated  meaningfully  or  financially  in  either  program?  Are  there  limitations  that  we 
should know about? 

Answer.  FEMA  has  the  opportunity  to  play  an  important  role  as  a  participant  in 
the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP). The NTHMP receives 
strong regional level support from FEMA Region X, whose staff attends all NTHMP 
meetings.  FEMA  Region  X  also  supports  including  tsunamis  as  part  of  the  FEMA 
National  Flood  Insurance  Program,  and  has  funded  a  pilot  project  being  conducted 
by  NOAA  to  evaluate  this  inclusion.  NOAA  does  not  participate  in  the  National 
Earthquake  Hazard  Reduction  Program  (NEHRP),  and  therefore  cannot  speak  to 
FEMA’s  contributions  to  that  program.  Our  federal  partners,  such  as  NSF,  NIST, 
and USGS, are better suited to address FEMA’s participation in the NEHRP.

Question  4c.  How  can  we  improve  coordination  and  better  define  agency  roles  in 

our legislation? 

Answer.  An  effective  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program  requires  ac-
tive  participation  of  key  federal  and  state  partners.  NOAA  believes  this  can  be  ac-
complished within the existing NTHMP. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO

BRIGADIER GENERAL JOHN J. KELLY 

Question  1.  I  recently  visited  the  Pacific  Marine  Environmental  Laboratory 
(PMEL)  in  Seattle,  which,  as  you  know,  provides  research  support  for  all  aspects 
of the U.S. tsunami program. I was extremely impressed by their work and dedica-

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  13:59 Nov 17, 2005 Jkt 022845 PO 00000 Frm 00092 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\22845.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

89

tion and I thank you for your support of this critical facility. As I’m sure you know, 
PMEL  developed  the  DART  buoys,  which  are,  and  will  be,  a  critical  component  of 
our  Nation’s  tsunami  warning  system.  These  technologies  have  greatly  reduced  the 
number of false tsunami alerts, which helps people take real alarms seriously. How-
ever,  I  was  troubled  to  learn  that  three  out  of  the  six  buoys  in  the  Pacific  Ocean, 
including the one off Washington’s coastline, are currently not functioning properly. 
An emergency repair last month only lasted four days, and then a few days ago the 
buoy  started  working  again.  What  this  situation  illustrates,  I  believe,  is  the  need 
for  more  reliable  buoys  and  a  more  redundant  system.  When  I  visited  PMEL,  I 
learned  they  were  working  on  developing  a  new  generation  of  buoys  that  would  be 
more  reliable,  have  a  longer  working  life,  have  improved  two-way  communications, 
and  hopefully  be  less  expensive  to  produce  than  the  older  models.  Can  you  please 
explain how you feel passage of this legislation will accelerate the timeline for com-
pletion  of  these  buoys?  Will  the  buoys  deployed  under  the  Administration’s  plan  be 
more reliable? 

Answer.  NOAA  agrees  that  we  need  a  reliable  and  redundant  tsunami-warning 
system,  and  we  have  accounted  for  some  redundancy  in  our  plan.  It  is  important 
to note that the current DART network (DART I) is a research system that was only 
recently  (October  2003)  transitioned  into  operations.  As  you  mentioned,  the  DART 
stations are being redesigned to include redundant features so that they will better 
withstand  the  harsh  conditions  in  the  northern  Pacific.  The  redundant  capabilities 
built  into  the  stations  will  increase  the  life  span  of  the  DART  systems,  as  will  rou-
tine  maintenance  of  the  stations.  NOAA  will  also  maintain  three  redundant  in-
water  backup  stations  in  the  Gulf  of  Alaska,  where  sea  conditions  are  particularly 
harsh and servicing buoys can be difficult. 

The  Administration’s  plan  was  developed  in  response  to  the  Indian  Ocean  Tsu-
nami,  and  is  designed  to  improve  and  expand  coverage  for  the  United  States.  This 
plan  represents  an  accelerated  version  of  NOAA’s  current  efforts  through  the  Na-
tional  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program  (NTHMP),  and  has  accelerated  the 
timeline  for  completion  of  the  full  network  of  DART  stations.  The  U.S.  Tsunami 
Warning System, as described in the Administration’s plan, will use the funds over 
the  next  two  years  to  expand  U.S.  tsunami  detection  and  monitoring  capabilities. 
The  complete  network  of  39  DART  stations  is  planned  to  be  fully  operational  by 
mid-2007.  These  measures  will  provide  the  United  States  with  nearly  100  percent 
detection  capability  for  a  U.S.  coastal  tsunami,  allowing  response  within  minutes. 
The  buoys  that  will  be  deployed  in  the  Administration’s  plan  are  those  you  de-
scribe—capable  of  two  way  communications  and  we  expect  this  next  generation 
DART  system,  DART  II,  to  be  more  reliable.  As  there  is  always  room  for  improve-
ment, the Administration’s 2-year plan also provides $1M for research and develop-
ment for future innovation of the DART network.

Question  2.  I  understand  the  next  major  tsunami  to  hit  the  Washington  coast 
could  originate  from  an  earthquake  along  the  Cascadia  plate  rather  than  a  deep 
ocean  earthquake.  However,  the  buoy-based  warning  system  would  be  largely  use-
less  detecting  a  near-shore  tsunami.  Are  there  ways  to  make  our  current  tsunami 
warning  system  more  effective  for  mitigating  near-shore  hazards?  For  example,  the 
NSF’s  NEPTUNE  program  to  wire  the  Juan  de  Fuca  plate  with  fiber  optic  lines 
seems to be supportive of these efforts. Do you feel that there are other technologies 
or  approaches  Congress  should  consider  funding  that  might  produce  more  timely 
warning for near-shore generated tsunamis? 

Answer.  Near-shore  generated  tsunamis  present  a  difficult  challenge.  NOAA  and 
federal,  state  and  local  emergency  managers  have  ensured  warning  dissemination 
capabilities are in place for people to receive tsunami warnings. With response time 
for these events measured in ‘‘minutes’’ rather than ‘‘hours,’’ education and outreach 
are  critical,  as  with  tornadoes,  to  enable  people  to  understand  their  vulnerabilities 
and take appropriate action immediately. The Administration’s plan includes $2.5M 
for education and outreach efforts, including NOAA’s TsunamiReady program.

Question 3. On my recent visit to PMEL, I learned that Washington State is vul-
nerable not only to tsunamis generated by distant earthquakes in the North Pacific 
Ocean or the closer Cascadia subduction zone, but also from faults within the Puget 
Sound.  In  fact,  there  is  a  fault  line  that  goes  right  across  Puget  Sound  and  down-
town Seattle. While the last major earthquake event happened in the year 1100, sci-
entists  believe  another  event  could  happen  at  any  time.  Although  a  Puget  Sound 
generated  tsunami  would  provide  almost  no  time  to  effectively  evacuate  citizens  to 
higher  ground,  the  vulnerability  assessments  and  inundation  mapping  authorized 
by this bill is critical to inform city planners on future siting and permitting consid-
erations.  Can  you  tell  me  the  current  plans  to  analyze  the  tsunami  risk  for  inland 
bodies of water like the Puget Sound? 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  13:59 Nov 17, 2005 Jkt 022845 PO 00000 Frm 00093 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\22845.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

90

Answer.  The  impact  of  tsunamis  on  inland  bodies  of  water,  such  as  the  Puget 
Sound,  is  being  researched  by  NOAA  through  inundation  mapping  and  computer 
modeling efforts. The analysis of risks to areas such as these is included in NOAA’s 
inundation mapping efforts.

Question  4.  Considering  the  short  warning  time  for  earthquake-derived  tsunamis 
within  the  Puget  Sound,  are  there  other  technologies  that  you  think  could  provide 
more timely warning to these inland areas? 

Answer.  Issuing  improved  local  tsunami  warnings  due  to  near-shore  earthquakes 
requires  enhanced  earthquake  detection  capabilities.  The  U.S.  Geological  Survey 
(USGS),  which  operates  the  Advanced  National  Seismic  System  to  detect  domestic 
earthquakes and jointly operates the Global Seismographic Network (GSN) with the 
National  Science  Foundation,  is  best  suited  to  answer  this  question.  However,  the 
Administration’s  plan  includes  funding  for  upgraded  seismometers  used  to  improve 
tsunami  detection  and  includes  funding  for  improvements  to  the  GSN.  Most 
tsunamis are triggered by seismic events, and improvements to the GSN are critical 
to (1) quickly determine the precise location of the seismic event (2) its precise mag-
nitude  and  (3)  quickly  disseminate  this  information  to  the  USGS  National  Earth-
quake Information Center and the NOAA Tsunami Warning Centers. Prior planning 
and  rapid  response  are  the  most  effective  means  of  minimizing  casualties  in  any 
local  tsunami  event.  People  must  be  educated  to  move  to  higher  ground  if  they  are 
in tsunami threatened area and can feel a strong ground shaking. Until we are able 
to  forecast  earthquakes,  we  are  limited  in  how  well  we  can  forecast  local  tsunami 
events.

Question  5.  I  am  grateful  for  NOAA’s  work  through  the  TsunamiReady  program 
preparing coastal communities for tsunami hazards. However, you yourself noted in 
your testimony that very few coastal communities currently meet NOAA’s standards 
of  tsunami  preparedness.  In  fact,  only  three  Washington  State  communities  qualify 
as ‘‘tsunami ready’’ under NOAA’s program. How do you plan to work with commu-
nities and local emergency response agencies to improve and develop emergency re-
sponse strategies? 

Answer.  NOAA  is  committed  to  accelerating  and  expanding  its  TsunamiReady 
community  program  to  all  at-risk  communities.  The  Administration’s  plan  provides 
$2.5M to NOAA over two years to support public education activities, including com-
munity  preparedness  activities  such  as  the  TsunamiReady  Program.  While  NOAA 
recognizes  achieving  TsunamiReady  status  requires  significant  state  and  local  sup-
port, NOAA will continue working with local communities to leverage existing assets 
and  community  warning  preparedness  programs,  which  provide  the  foundation  for 
allowing a community to become ‘‘TsunamiReady.’’ NOAA will also continue to work 
with  communities  and  local  emergency  response  agencies  interested  in  developing 
or  improving  emergency  response  strategies,  through  our  participation  in  the  Na-
tional Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP).

Question  6.  Although  I  am  very  concerned  about  the  threat  of  a  tsunami  to  a 
coastal  or  Puget  Sound  community,  I  would  also  like  to  state  for  the  record  that  I 
remain  concerned  about  all  hazards.  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  me  that  related 
threats be considered when investing resources in tsunami preparedness. Do you see 
ways  in  which  earthquake  preparedness  can  be  combined  with  tsunami  prepared-
ness  with  the  passage  of  this  bill?  Please  explain  if  you  see  opportunities  to  maxi-
mize  hazard  preparedness  by  preparing  for  both  earthquake  and  tsunami  threats. 
Answer.  The  National  Earthquake  Hazard  Reduction  Program  (NEHRP)  activi-
ties,  under  the  leadership  of  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology 
(NIST) and other experts, are consistent with those of the National Tsunami Hazard 
Mitigation Program.

Question  7.  Like  Senator  Stevens,  I  am  concerned  about  coordination  of  agency 
efforts  to  ensure  effective  use  of  resources  and  efficient  warning  systems.  I  under-
stand  that  the  National  Earthquake  Information  Center  of  the  USGS  is  the  recog-
nized  worldwide  authority  for  rapid  earthquake  detection  and  location  and  already 
has  most  of  the  technological  resources  to  provide  earthquake  information  rapidly 
to  anyone  globally.  I  would  like  to  know  specifically  how  the  NOAA  tsunami  warn-
ing  centers  and  the  USGS  NEIC  can  coordinate  to  make  sure  that  we  create  the 
best warning system possible without duplication of effort. 

Answer.  NOAA  and  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS)  National  Earthquake  In-
formation  Center  (NEIC)  currently  coordinate  to  make  sure  that  we  have  the  best, 
and  most  efficient,  tsunami  warning  system  possible.  The  USGS  operates  the  Ad-
vanced  National  Seismic  System  domestically  and  jointly  operates  the  Global  Seis-
mographic  Network  (GSN)  with  the  National  Science  Foundation.  These  networks 
provide  data  in  real  time  to  NOAA’s  tsunami  warning  centers  through  the  USGS 
NEIC. The NEIC has a direct link into the NOAA dissemination network, which im-

91

mediately transmits earthquake information to the NOAA tsunami warning centers. 
NOAA,  USGS,  and  FEMA  are  members  of  the  NTHMP  and  as  such,  have  worked 
together to ensure coordination. Installation of the Consolidated Reporting of Earth-
quakes  and  Tsunamis  (CREST)  system  is  an  example  of  coordination  between 
NOAA  and  USGS  to  strengthen  the  ability  to  rapidly  detect  tsunamigenic  earth-
quakes.

Question  8.  I  understand  that  the  conditions  in  which  the  DART  buoys  operate 
can be dangerous and that a certain rate of equipment failure may be unavoidable. 
However, I’m concerned that 3 of 6 DART buoys are currently unreliable, including 
the  buoy  off  the  Washington  coast.  In  your  estimation,  what  is  the  failure  rate  of 
these buoys and the new buoys that might succeed the current generation of DART 
buoys? Given that failure rate, what is your estimation of the average effectiveness 
of this system? 

Answer. While it is true that, at the time of the hearing, 2 of the 6 DART stations 
were  offline,  this  does  not  indicate  that  these  buoys  are  unreliable  in  general.  The 
reliability  of  the  DART  stations,  since  October  2003,  the  time  when  they  were 
transitioned from a research program of NOAA Research to an operational program 
of  NOAA’s  National  Weather  Service,  has  been  72  percent.  This  percentage  rep-
resents the combined number of hours the stations have been operational, and indi-
cates  that  the  DART  station  array  is  a  highly  effective  system  overall.  Our  goal  is 
to have a fully capable network of 29 DART stations in the Pacific, with 3 additional 
in-water  backups  on  the  Gulf  of  Alaska.  While  it  is  not  possible  to  guarantee  that 
these  prototype  stations  will  be  operational  100  percent  of  the  time,  NOAA  is  fo-
cused  making  the  DART  I  network  more  robust  and  deploying  a  DART  II  network 
with  reliability  built  into  the  design.  NOAA  plans  for  the  network  to  meet  oper-
ational  requirements,  even  with  occasional  DART  station  outages.  NOAA  will  de-
velop  capabilities  to  address  network  coverage  and  redundancy  to  ensure,  as  best 
we can, that single DART station failures will not impact the integrity of the entire 
network.  Planned  redundancy  and  hardening  of  the  infrastructure,  combined  with 
the addition of a two-way communication capability, will mitigate risk from system-
wide failures.

Question  9.  Confronted  with  a  fresh  reminder  of  the  potential  devastation  of  an 
off-shore,  tsunami-causing  earthquake,  I  share  Senator  Stevens’  concern  about  en-
suring  sufficient  warning  systems  are  in  place  so  that  loss  of  human  life  can  be 
minimized. Senator Stevens requested an estimation of what it would take to estab-
lish  a  comprehensive  tsunami  notification  system.  I  am  very  interested  in  your  re-
sponse  and  ask  that  you  please  forward  me  a  copy  of  your  answer  to  Senator  Ste-
vens’ question. 

Answer.  A  copy  of  the  NOAA  response  to  Senators  Stevens  and  Inouye  (as  well 
as  the  incoming  letter  from  the  Senators)  was  faxed  to  your  staff  (Amit  Ronen)  on 
Thursday, March 3, 2005.

Question  1.  Effective  tsunami  warning  should  rely  on  a  variety  of  redundant 
modes  of  communication.  While  there  are  several  technologies  for  communicating 
tsunami  warnings  highlighted  in  the  Tsunami  Preparedness  Act  of  2005  (S.  50),  it 
is  a  concern  that  voice  capable  sirens  are  not  among  the  technologies  mentioned. 
Emergency managers have long depended on sirens to warn the public of emergency 
and  civil  defense  situations  including  tsunamis,  tornados,  floods,  hurricanes,  haz-
ardous material accidents, and of a potential nuclear attack. 

Sirens have a number of significant advantages: they insure that all residents and 
visitors  to  a  particular  area  can  be  informed  without  regard  to  the  cell  phone  or 
pager  technology  platform  or  provider  they  may  have,  when  equipped  with  backup 
power  supplies  they  will  work  even  when  the  electricity  or  phone  lines  are  out; 
when  equipped  with  live  public  address  or  pre-recorded  messages  they  can  be  used 
BEFORE and AFTER the incident to communicate important public safety informa-
tion. 

Without the use of/installation of voice sirens as part of a preparedness plan, how 
do you warn people on the ground? Are there other effective warning systems avail-
able  for  this  purpose?  What  criteria  are  used  to  determine  which  warning  system 
is reliable in case of tsunami? 

Answer.  The  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  works 
with the emergency management community to ensure warnings are received by the

public  in  as  many  ways  as  possible—including  cell  phones,  pagers,  Internet,  NOAA 
Weather  Radio  All-Hazards,  television,  radio,  and  sirens.  All  of  these  methods  are 
effective,  and  emergency  managers  must  decide  how  to  best  warn  the  public. 
NOAA’s  dissemination  systems  are  available  for  the  emergency  management  com-
munity  to  use  in  broadcasting  emergency  messages.  NOAA  will  continue  working 
with federal, state and local emergency managers to ensure warnings are as widely 
distributed  as  possible.  Some  National  Weather  Service  Offices  also  issue  tsunami 
warnings  via  High  Frequency  (HF)  and  Very  High  Frequency  (VHF)  marine  radio 
as  well,  as  do  other  federal  agencies.  There  are  no  unique  criteria  for  determining 
which warning systems are reliable for tsunamis.

Question 1a. Should a preparedness plan include a warning mechanism for small 
fishing  boats  trawling  near  the  coastline?  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Ad-
ministration  (NOAA)  weather  radios  can  be  used  to  inform  these  fishing  boats  at 
minimal cost (approximately $20). 

Answer.  A  comprehensive  preparedness  plan  must  address  how  to  get  messages 
to people, whenever they need it, wherever they are. NOAA Weather Radio All-Haz-
ards is an effective way to reach fishing boats near the coast. There are other alter-
natives  available  as  well,  including  satellite  based  communications  links  (Internet 
and  cell  phone).  We  employ  all  possible  methods  of  delivering  warnings  to  those  at 
risk. 
Improving Tsunami Prediction and Preparedness 

Question 2. NOAA’s National Weather Service has been able to mark its progress 
in  severe  weather  prediction  and  forecasting  with  a  number  of  useful  metrics.  For 
example, they have substantially increased warning times for hurricanes and torna-
does,  while  at  the  same  time  increasing  accuracy  of  forecasts.  Unlike  these  events, 
tsunamis are caused by largely unpredictable tectonic events that can strike without 
warning,  which  makes  improving  prediction  a  bit  harder.  However,  it  is  important 
that  we  use  the  same  approach  to  improving  out  tsunami  prediction  and  warnings. 
One  way  we  have  started  to  characterize  our  success  is  a  75  percent  reduction  in 
false  alarms  since  1996.  This  is  indeed  an  accomplishment.  But  we  also  want  to 
make  sure  that  when  a  deadly  tsunami  is  headed  for  our  coasts,  we  have  the  best 
information possible for our communities on time, place and severity. 

What  kind  of  progress  have  we  made  in  accuracy  of  forecasting  and  prediction 

since 1996? What is a good measure of such progress? 

Answer. Tsunamis often result from unpredictable seismic events that strike with-
out  warning.  It  is  a  challenge  to  improving  the  prediction  of  tsunami-genesis.  With 
each  tornado  or  hurricane,  NOAA  collects  a  tremendous  amount  of  data.  We  are 
able  to  learn  new  things  about  these  natural  disasters  with  every  event;  this  infor-
mation  aids  us  in  our  efforts  to  improve  prediction.  Fortunately,  tsunamis  are  rel-
atively infrequent. That means we record fewer events and have much we can learn 
when  it  comes  to  tsunami  generation  and  propagation.  Understanding  how  these 
natural disasters develop is key to determining how we can predict these destructive 
events. 

The Administration’s plan calls for NOAA to have a network of 39 advanced-tech-
nology Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) buoys for a fully 
operational  enhanced  tsunami  warning  system  by  mid–2007.  With  a  complete  net-
work of DART stations, we will have the opportunity to detect more tsunami events, 
and  we  have  the  opportunity  to  learn  from  each  one.  In  November  2003,  a  large 
earthquake  occurred  in  the  Aleutian  Islands  and  generated  a  tsunami.  The  DART 
stations recorded this event, confirming only a small tsunami. During post analysis 
of the event, DART data were used for a model simulation and the output from the 
simulation  accurately  predicted  the  2  cm  tsunami  recorded  at  Hilo,  Hawaii.  With 
each tsunami-event recorded by the DART stations, we have the opportunity to fine-
tune  our  models  used  to  predict  tsunami  impacts.  The  DART  data  combined  with 
forecast  models  promise  to  significantly  reduce  false  alarm  rates  as  well  as  provide 
a  better  measure  of  the  severity  of  destructive  tsunamis  for  Hawaii  and  all  other 
parts  of  the  Pacific.  The  accurate  forecasting  of  a  non-destructive  tsunami  in  No-
vember  2003  saved  Hawaii  an  estimated  $68M  in  projected  evacuation  costs.  With 
the additional DART stations, we expect to substantially reduce false alarm rate for 
distant tsunamis from 75 percent to less than 25 percent over the next 4 years. Lit-
tle  change  is  expected  in  reducing  false  alarms  for  local  tsunamis  (those  generated 
from near-shore causes). A reduction in the rate of false alarms, and the associated 
cost-savings for our states and territories, is an appropriate measure of our progress 
in tsunami detection.

Question 2a. What other metrics will be important to pay attention to? For exam-
ple,  only  30  percent  of  our  communities  at  risk  have  inundation  maps—shouldn’t 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  13:59 Nov 17, 2005 Jkt 022845 PO 00000 Frm 00096 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\22845.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

93

this  percentage  improve?  How  much  will  this  metric  improve  with  the  funds  pro-
posed under the President’s plan? 

Answer.  NOAA  agrees  that  the  percentage  of  at-risk  communities  with  complete 
inundation  maps  is  an  important  metric,  and  we  are  working  to  increase  the  num-
ber  of  areas  covered  by  inundation  maps.  Another  important  metric  is  the  number 
of  at-risk  communities  that  are  ‘‘TsunamiReady.’’  NOAA’s  TsunamiReady  program 
promotes  tsunami  hazard  preparedness  as  an  active  collaboration  among  federal, 
state  and  local  emergency  management  agencies,  the  public,  and  the  National 
Weather Service tsunami warning system. The Administration’s plan provides fund-
ing  to  allow  NOAA  to  increase  the  number  of  mapped  and  TsunamiReady  commu-
nities.  Of  the  $24M  scheduled  for  NOAA  use,  approximately  $4.75M  will  be  spent 
on inundation mapping and modeling, as well as education and outreach (e.g., com-
munity  preparedness  activities,  including  TsunamiReady).  Of  this  $4.75M,  approxi-
mately  $2.25M  will  be  spent  on  inundation  mapping  and  modeling  and  $2.5M  will 
go towards public education activities. Following the current plan, inundation map-
ping for the major population centers will be complete in 2015.

Question  2b.  Since  we  have  experienced  a  50  percent  decline  in  buoy  service  in 
the  past  2  years,  wouldn’t  this  be  another  metric  to  focus  on?  What  will  be  your 
goal? 

Answer.  It  is  not  accurate  to  say  that  we  have  experienced  a  50  percent  decline 
in  buoy  service  in  the  past  2  years.  We  believe  you  are  referring  to  technical  mal-
functions  of  3  of  the  6  DART  buoys  in  the  weeks  preceding  the  hearing.  While  it 
is  true  that  at  the  time  of  the  hearing,  2  of  the  6  DART  stations  were  offline,  this 
does not indicate a 50 percent decline in performance over the last 2 years. The reli-
ability  of  the  DART  stations  since  October  2003,  the  time  when  they  were 
transitioned  from  a  research  program  of  the  Office  of  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Re-
search to an operational program of the National Weather Service, has been 72 per-
cent.  This  percentage  represents  the  combined  number  of  hours  the  stations  have 
been  operational,  and  is  an  appropriate  metric  to  use  in  evaluating  the  reliability 
of the DART system. Further, this percentage indicates that the DART station array 
is a highly effective system overall. 

Our  goal  is  to  have  a  fully  capable  network  of  29  DART  stations  in  the  Pacific, 
with  3  additional  in-water  backups  in  the  Gulf  of  Alaska,  where  sea  conditions  are 
particularly  harsh.  While  it  is  not  possible  to  guarantee  that  these  stations  will  be 
operational  100  percent  of  the  time  given  the  demanding  environmental  conditions 
in which these stations operate, NOAA is focused on making the current DART net-
work (DART I) more robust and deploying a next generation DART network (DART 
II) with reliability built into the design. NOAA plans for the network to meet oper-
ational  requirements,  even  with  occasional  DART  station  outages.  NOAA  will  de-
velop  capabilities  to  address  network  coverage  and  redundancy  to  ensure,  as  best 
we can, that single DART station failures will not impact the integrity of the entire 
network.  Planned  redundancy  and  hardening  of  the  infrastructure,  combined  with 
the addition of a two-way communication capability, will mitigate risk from system-
wide failures. 
Funding for Tsunami Mitigation and Response 

Question  3.  The  Administration  recently  released  its  plan  to  expand  and  mod-
ernize  its  tsunami  detection  and  warning  system.  This  plan  includes  the  expansion 
of the system into areas such as the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico. 
I applaud the Administration’s timely response, however, I am concerned that while 
the  plan  addresses  the  issue  of  tsunami  detection,  it  does  not  completely  address 
the issue of response to tsunami, as well as community preparation. 

Which agency will be taking the lead for mitigation, mapping, and response? 
Answer.  NOAA,  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA),  and  the 
United States Geologic Survey (USGS), through the National Tsunami Hazard Miti-
gation  Program,  coordinate  inundation  mapping  efforts  with  state  and  local  emer-
gency  management  officials.  FEMA  is  the  lead  agency  for  mitigation  and  response, 
with  NOAA  assisting  any  way  possible.  NOAA’s  role  is  to  assist  in  identifying  the 
tsunami  hazard  (required  inundation  mapping),  providing  tsunami  warning  guid-
ance (including site-specific tsunami forecast models) and providing tsunami mitiga-
tion  program  support  through  community-based  preparedness  programs  and  edu-
cation outreach—including the TsunamiReady Program.

Question 3a. Does the funding proposed by the Administration include funding for 

tsunami response? How much? 

Answer.  The  two-year  plan  proposed  by  the  Administration  includes  funding  for 
NOAA  and  USGS  for  an  improved  tsunami  detection  and  warning  system.  FEMA 
is  the  lead  federal  agency  in  the  response  area  and  is  best  suited  to  answer  ques-
tions regarding response funding.

94

Question  3b.  Will  these  amounts  be  adequate  given  the  plans  for  expanded  areas 

of coverage for the tsunami program? 

Answer. The new NOAA funding for mitigation includes $2.5M for education and 
outreach and $2.25M for inundation mapping. This is a significant increase from the 
base funding levels managed through the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Pro-
gram.  FEMA  is  the  lead  federal  agency  in  the  response  area  and  is  best  suited  to 
answer questions regarding response funding. 

RESPONSE TO LETTER DATED FEBRUARY 7, 2005 FROM CHAIRMAN STEVENS AND

CO-CHAIRMAN INOUYE TO VICE ADMIRAL CONRAD C. LAUTENBACHER, JR. 

In  response  to  a  letter,  dated  February  7,  2005  from  Chairman  Ted  Stevens  and 

Co-Chairman Daniel K. Inouye, asking to: 

Please  explain  what  information  or  resources  your  agency  requires  before  it  can 
issue  a  public  warning  notification  of  a  natural  hazard  or  disaster.  In  addition,  we 
would  like  to  know  which  entities  or  organizations  receive  warnings  from,  or 
through,  your  agency,  such  as  the  appropriate  federal  and  local  disaster  response 
entities,  first  responders/911,  and  local  and  national  media  outlets.  To  the  extent 
possible,  your  report  should  also  demonstrate  which  communications  technologies 
are  currently  used  to  deliver  these  public  warnings,  such  as  automatic  alert  tele-
visions  and  radios,  telephones,  wireless  and  satellite  technology,  including  cellular 
telephones, pagers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and the internet. If such com-
munications  technologies  are  not  being  used,  we  would  like  to  know  what  the  im-
pediments  are,  and  the  status  of  any  discussions  to  expand  the  warning  system’s 
capability to do so. 

Your report should also specify a process by which your agency, either on its own, 
or in conjunction with other relevant agencies, can maximize effective dissemination 
of  public  warning  notifications.  Lastly,  we  would  be  interested  to  know  how  your 
agency  interacts  with  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (including  the  Federal 
Emergency  Management  Agency),  the  Federal  Communications  Commission,  the 
Department  of  Commerce,  or  other  relevant  agencies  with  respect  to  warning  sys-
tems. 
Response 

Thank you for your letter regarding General John J. Kelly’s testimony at the Feb-
ruary  2,  2005,  hearing  of  the  Senate  Committee  on  Commerce,  Science  and  Trans-
portation  on  the  U.S.  tsunami  warning  system  and  the  Tsunami  Preparedness  Act 
of  2005.  At  the  hearing,  you  asked  us  to  tell  the  Committee  how  the  National  Oce-
anic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  could  improve  public  notification  of 
impending natural hazards and disasters. 

NOAA’s National Weather Service (NWS) is acknowledged as the premier agency 
in  government  for  disseminating  warning  information.  We  are  efficient  at  dissemi-
nating  weather  and  natural  hazard  information  through  our  vast  communication 
network.  We  currently  provide  public  notification  of  weather  warnings  as  well  as 
other natural hazards and disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and civil emer-
gency  messages,  e.g.,  hazardous  materials  spills.  These  warnings  can  be  received 
and  transmitted  by  a  myriad  of  other  users  providing  access  to  virtually  all  of  the 
people across the Nation. We can provide access, but we cannot ensure the message 
is received. 

While our system is effective, we can still make improvements. We can make our 
systems  more  reliable  and  improve  public  education.  We  can  work  with  the  private 
sector  to  utilize  new  technology  to  make  warnings  available,  and  develop  other 
methods to increase accessibility of warnings. 

NOAA  Weather,  Alert,  and  Readiness  Network  (NOAA  WARN),  includes  all 
NOAA’s National Weather Service warning dissemination systems (see attachment). 
This  includes  the  NOAA  Weather  Radio  All  Hazards  (NWR)  program,  which  con-
sists of over 900 radio transmitters covering nearly 97 percent of the nation’s popu-
lation.  The  President’s  FY06  Budget  request  includes  funds  to  modernize  64  of  400 
remaining  vintage  1970’s  NWR  transmitters.  These  improvements  will  make  them 
more robust by including backup power supply, and make them easier to maintain. 
Backup  power  is  critical  during  major  weather  events,  such  as  hurricanes,  when 
commercial power is out. 

Our  assessment  and  decision-making  equipment,  the  Advanced  Weather  Inter-
active  Processing  System  (AWIPS),  is  the  initial  generation  point  for  all  NWS  dis-
seminated warnings. We are working to ensure AWIPS has appropriate software ca-
pabilities, capable of disseminating new information technology standard formats, to

effectively  support  the  new  technologies  such  as  Geophysical  Information  Systems 
(GIS) and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). 

Issuing  weather  and  water  related  warnings  (including  tsunamis)  are  the  cul-
mination  of  a  complex  process,  beginning  with  observations,  analysis,  and  interpre-
tation,  and  culminating  with  disseminating  the  warning.  NOAA’s  NWS  maintains 
a  complex  infrastructure  of  people  and  technology  to  create,  and  then  issue  those 
warnings. It is our mission. It is what we do. 

Issuing civil emergency warnings or earthquake warnings has a different process. 
NWS  serves  as  a  dissemination  service  for  these  warnings.  We  rely  on  communica-
tion  processing,  which  is  automated  for  earthquake  warnings,  and  is  being  auto-
mated  for  federal,  state  and  local  civil  emergency  messages.  For  these  civil  emer-
gency  messages  to  be  disseminated,  we  need  to  ensure  agreements  are  in  place  to 
allow  access  to  NOAA  dissemination  systems.  In  June  2004,  the  Department  of 
Homeland Security (DHS) and NOAA signed a Memorandum of Agreement allowing 
DHS  to  use  the  NOAA  Weather  Radio  All  Hazards  network  to  disseminate  civil 
emergency messages. 

Once  warnings  are  in  NOAA  WARN,  they  are  automatically  transmitted  to  the 
Emergency Alert System (EAS; for wide distribution in real and near-real time), the 
NWS  dissemination  network,  and  through  other  private  and  public  dissemination 
systems.  NOAA  WARN  systems  include  NWR,  NOAA  Weather  Wire,  NOAAPort, 
Emergency  Managers  Weather  Information  Network  (EMWIN),  and  the  Internet. 
Most local and all national media outlets have links to NOAA’s NWS dissemination 
network to receive warning information. 

Warning  messages  from  NOAA’s  NWS  activate  the  EAS  and  also  reach  the  pri-
vate  sector,  which  rebroadcast  the  emergency  information  via  television,  radio, 
internet  (e.g.,  e-mail  warnings),  pagers,  and  in  some  cases  PDAs  and  cell  phones. 
Through  this  warning  system,  all  appropriate  federal  and  local  emergency  officials 
have access to the warning information and can receive warnings. 

Newer technology (e.g., cell phones, reverse 911, PDA’s, pagers) can receive warn-
ing  information,  but  most  are  set  up  to  do  so  only  when  requested  by  the  user  or 
as  a  subscription  service.  There  is  no  federal,  state  or  local  policy  in  place  to  man-
date  redistribution  of  warning  information.  While  there  are  some  technical  chal-
lenges  to  alert,  for  example,  every  cell  phone  within  a  certain  area,  it  is  possible. 
The difficulty with broadcast cell phone warnings is there are no national standards. 
NOAA  will  continue  to  work  with  appropriate  public  and  private  entities  to  ensure 
warning information is available in industry standard formats for ease of interoper-
ability. 

NOAA  and  DHS  have  ongoing  discussions  with  satellite  communications  opera-
tors, such as XM Satellite Radio, who already have a channel devoted to emergency 
messages.  This  method  to  deliver  warnings  shows  promise,  with  the  only  reserva-
tion at this point the limited number of users. 

Effective dissemination of public warning notification requires using existing sys-
tems  and  infrastructure  where  possible  and  public  education  and  outreach  to  rec-
ommend  what  actions  to  take  once  the  warnings  are  issued.  For  example,  USGS 
uses  the  NWS  infrastructure  to  disseminate  earthquake  messages  and,  as  stated 
above,  DHS  also  has  access  to  NWR  to  disseminate  warnings.  This  is  an  efficient 
use of government infrastructure. All federal agencies involved in warning the pub-
lic  need  to  continue  to  work  together  to  leverage  available  assets.  NOAA  has  been 
working  with  DHS,  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC),  and  other 
agencies  within  the  Department  of  Commerce  to  help  coordinate  the  federal  effort 
on a consolidated warning system to ensure the public is able to receive emergency 
messages. This dialogue will continue. 

For  example,  NWS  is  working  with  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency 
(FEMA) on a system to streamline the ability of pre-approved and authenticated of-
ficials at federal, state, and local levels to submit messages for broadcast over NWS 
systems.  The  NWS  received  funds  in  the  FY  2004  Omnibus  Appropriations  Act  to 
streamline and automate the current manual creation, authentication, and collection 
of  all  types  of  non-weather  emergency  messages  in  a  quick  and  secure  fashion  for 
subsequent alert, warning, and notification purposes. HazCollect, as the new system 
is  known,  will  function  through  FEMA’s  Disaster  Management  Interoperability 
Service (DMIS). All weather and non-weather emergency messages will be available 
on  the  DMIS  backbone  network  for  national,  state  and  local  dissemination  through 
myriad public and private sector systems. 

Essential  to  any  effective  warning  system  is  education  and  outreach.  NOAA’s 
NWS has two programs to help ensure local communities can receive warning infor-
mation  they  need—StormReady  and  TsunamiReady.  These  programs  focus  on  pre-
paredness  and  education  activities  to  make  sure  local  communities  can  take  appro-
priate steps once the warning information is received. One of the criteria for a com-

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  13:59 Nov 17, 2005 Jkt 022845 PO 00000 Frm 00099 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\22845.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

96

munity  to  be  certified  as  StormReady  is  to  have  in  place  alternate  and  redundant 
ways  to  receive  warnings.  For  example,  an  emergency  operations  center  may  have 
Internet  notification  as  well  as  NWR  as  their  methods  to  receive  warnings.  Receiv-
ing warnings through multiple systems reduces the possibility of missing critical in-
formation. 

NOAA is working with DHS and other federal, state and local agencies to increase 
usage of NWR and expand the use of new and emerging technology to deliver warn-
ings. Timeliness is always a factor, but existing NWS dissemination systems trans-
mit  warnings  usually  within  seconds.  Redistribution  through  EAS  is  also  quick. 
However, the Nation needs a federal lead agency for a nationwide warning system, 
using a common message standard. We believe DHS/FEMA is the appropriate agen-
cy  to  lead  such  an  effort,  and  must  build  on  existing  warning  systems,  such  as 
NOAA WARN, to create a warning ‘‘system of systems.’’

American territories, such as American Samoa, do not have an extensive commu-
nications  infrastructure.  NOAA  is  working  with  these  communities  and  our  inter-
national partners to ensure warning information is communicated to government of-
ficials. Much communication is done through the Emergency Managers Weather In-
formation Network (EMWIN) and Radio and Internet (RANET) systems. 

Enclosed  is  a  brief  summary  of  existing  NOAA/NWS  and  related  federal  dissemi-
nation  systems.  We  would  be  pleased  to  meet  with  you  and  your  staff  to  provide 
more  detailed  information  about  NOAA  warning  dissemination  methods  and  proc-
esses. 

An  Integrated  Public  Alert  and  Warning  System  is  an  important  element  to  help 
keep  the  people  of  this  Nation  safe.  Public  safety  is  a  fundamental  responsibility 
of federal, state and local governments. Public alert and warning systems save lives 
by informing, reducing fear, and assisting emergency managers. NOAA will continue 
to  work  with  DHS,  FCC  and  other  government  agencies  to  continue  to  integrate 
these systems. 

NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards 

ENCLOSURE 

NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards (NWR) is a nationwide network of transmitters 
broadcasting  continuous  weather  information  directly  from  a  National  Weather 
Service  office.  NWR  broadcasts  National  Weather  Service  warnings,  watches,  fore-
casts,  and  other  hazard  information  24-hours  per  day.  Known  as  the  ‘‘voice  of 
NOAA’s National Weather Service,’’ NWR is provided as a public service by the De-
partment of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 
NWR  includes  more  than  925  transmitters,  covering  more  than  97  percent  of  the 
United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S. Pacific Territories. 
NWR  requires  a  special  radio  receiver  or  scanner  capable  of  picking  up  the  signal. 
Broadcasts are found in the public service band on seven frequencies. 

Currently, about 17 percent of the U.S. population owns a NOAA Weather Radio, 
though  the  actual  percentage  of  the  population  reached  may  be  greater  due  to  the 
promulgation  of  receivers  in  public  places  such  as  schools,  hospitals,  fire  stations, 
and  malls.  NOAA  Weather  Radio  receivers  can  be  purchased  at  many  retail  stores 
selling  electronic  merchandise.  Some 
televisions  are  now  equipped  with 
AlertGuardTM, which is essentially an embedded NWR receiver with alert capability. 
NOAA  Weather  Radio  All  Hazards  receivers  are  often  sold  in  boat  and  marine  ac-
cessory  businesses,  as  they  are  popular  in  the  marine  community.  These  are  just 
some of the places NOAA Weather Radio receivers can be purchased. 

A survey on Weather Radio Interests and Awareness conducted in August 2002 by 
eBrain Market Research (a service of the Consumer Electronics Association) identi-
fied the following key points:

• The  most  common  type  of  the  NOAA  Weather  Radio  owned  is  a  hand-held 
model (50 percent). Additionally, 32 percent of owners possess a desktop weath-
er radio, 19 percent own a marine weather radio that picks up NOAA Weather 
Radio,  11  percent  have  a  clock-radio  equipped  to  receive  NOAA  alerts,  and  10 
percent can pick up NOAA announcements on their CB.
• Given  the  right  product  offerings  and  marketing  campaigns  to  promote  aware-
ness of weather radios, it is possible manufacturers can sell 7.4 million weather 
radios over the next year.

Emergency Alert System 

The Emergency Alert System serves two functions:
• It provides a last resort method for the President to address the Nation in times 

of national attack or major crisis (National Alert).

• When  not  in  use  by  the  President,  it  can  be  used  to  issue  warning  messages 
of imminent or ongoing hazards at the state and local levels by radio, television, 
and  cable  systems  in  selected  regions.  (NOAA  Weather  Alert,  State  and  Local 
Alerts). 1

During a national alert, all radio and television stations and cable television sys-
tems  must  either  broadcast  Presidential  alerts  immediately  or  cease  transmission 
during  the  message.  Broadcasting  of  state  and  local  alerts  is  not  mandatory,  and 
stations/systems  can  postpone  broadcasting  a  given  warning  or  alert  still  in  force 
until there is a programming pause. National alerts are issued through the Primary 
Entry  Point  (PEP)  system  via  dialup  telephone  lines  (with  High  Frequency  (HF) 
radio  backups)  to  34  continental  U.S.  and  territorial  radio  stations.  For  national 
alert  and  warning,  the  34  PEP  stations  would  then  serve  as  relay  points  for  the 
Presidential message to automatically seize the broadcasts of all U.S. radio and TV 
and cable stations monitoring the PEP stations. The direct PEP radio station broad-
casts  cover  approximately  95  percent  of  the  continental  U.S.  and  Hawaii  and  the 
seized broadcast would cover well over 95 percent of the American public. 

State and local alerts generally originate in the State Emergency Operations Cen-
ter or other similar official location. Because there is no standard in the country for 
EAS plans, some states have more robust systems than others. For example, Florida 
and  Pennsylvania  use  satellite  technology  to  get  out  emergency  messages  from  the 
Governor  reaching  the  entire  state.  Most  other  states  rely  on  the  cascade  system 
used  for  typical  EAS  messages  where  stations  monitor  ‘‘up  stream’’  stations  for  a 
signal  until  the  entire  state  is  covered.  ‘‘Amber  Alerts’’  are  also  sent  out  over  the 
system;  these  may  originate  from  a  law  enforcement  agency  within  the  state.  The 
only  thing  states  using  the  system  have  in  common  is  that  they  all  must  enter  the 
system at some point from an authorized official. 

All  non-PEP  broadcast  stations  and  cable  systems  are  required  to  follow  their 
state EAS plans. 2 Integral to all state plans is they must specify monitoring assign-
ments  for  all  broadcast  stations  and  cable  systems  in  the  state.  All  broadcast  sta-
tions and cable systems are required to monitor at least two EAS sources according 
to  their  state  EAS  plan.  At  least  one  PEP  station  should  be  monitored  by  a  state’s 
EAS network so national level EAS messages can be distributed in the state. In an 
effort  to  bring  order  to  the  system,  all  broadcast  stations  and  cable  systems  have 
EAS designations. PEP stations have an EAS designation of National Primary (NP), 
since  they  are  the  source  of  national  level  messages.  State  level  sources  have  des-
ignations  of  State  Primary  (SP)  and  State  Relay  (SR)  and  local  sources  are  des-
ignated Local Primary (LP). 

There  is  also  one  national  network,  National  Public  Radio  (NPR),  which  has  vol-
untarily  agreed  to  distribute  national  level  messages  to  its  affiliates  via  satellite. 
The  NPR  directly  monitors  a  PEP/NP  station  and  will  relay  a  national  level  EAS 
message as soon as it is received. 

The  National  Weather  Service  (NWS)  originates  about  90  percent  of  all  EAS 
alerts.  Many  participating  EAS  entities  voluntarily  monitor  the  National  Weather 
Service’s NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) transmitting alerts. NWR supplies local EAS 
encoded  alerts  to  broadcast  and  cable  entry  points  as  described  in  each  approved 
state  and  local  EAS  plan.  In  many  localities,  emergency  managers  can  originate 
EAS alerts through NWS, through a broadcaster or cable operator, or through their 
own  equipment  if  they  have  made  prior  arrangements  documented  in  EAS  plans. 
Proper  operation  of  the  EAS  depends  on  those  state  and  local  plans  specifying  how 
stations  are  linked  together  in  monitoring  webs;  how  State  Primary  (SP),  State 
Relay  (SR)  and  Local  Primary  (LP)  EAS  sources  get  EAS  warnings;  how  EAS  test-
ing is accomplished; and which EAS messages may be relayed. 
National Warning System 

FEMA  maintains  and  operates  the  National  Warning  System  (NAWAS),  which 
was  developed  and  installed  during  the  1950s,  as  the  primary  national  emergency 
communication  system  among  federal,  state,  and  local  emergency  operations  cen-
ters.  NAWAS  is  a  dedicated,  24-hour,  specialized  party  telephone  line  with  1,850 
terminals  at  state  and  local  emergency  operations  centers,  911  centers,  and  police 
and  fire  stations  to  all  be  activated  at  the  same  time.  The  system  is  used  to  relay 
national and local information within states. It also has direct links to the command 
center at the North American Aerospace Defense Command. Every NWS forecast of-
fice has connectivity to NAWAS.

NOAA Weather Wire System 

The  NOAA  Weather  Wire  Service  (NWWS)  also  plays  a  role  in  getting  weather 
warnings  to  the  public.  NWWS  is  a  satellite  data  collection  and  dissemination  sys-
tem.  NWWS  broadcasts  can  be  received  anywhere  in  the  United  States  and  Puerto 
Rico.  NWWS  disseminates  warnings  in  less  than  10  seconds.  The  warnings  have 
embedded  digital  information  identifying  specific  threats  and  specific  geographic 
areas at risk. Satellite receivers are commercially available. At least one emergency 
management  or  law  enforcement  agency  in  each  state  has  NWWS.  These  agencies 
rebroadcast  the  information  to  other  state  and  local  emergency  managers  and  also 
provide local hazard information to the NWS for broadcast, when appropriate. 

Negotiations  are  underway  to  add  the  National  Law  Enforcement  Telecommuni-
cations  System  to  NWWS.  This  would  permit  several  thousand  law  enforcement 
agencies around the country to exchange all-hazard warnings. 
Emergency Managers Weather Information Network 

The Emergency Managers Weather Information Network (EMWIN) transmits real 
time weather and emergency information. The EMWIN signal is available anywhere 
within  the  NOAA’s  Geostationary  Operational  Environmental  Satellites  (GOES) 
footprint,  which  covers  most  of  the  western  hemisphere  as  well  as  the  central  and 
eastern Pacific Ocean. The National Weather Service gathers real time weather and 
emergency information from sources across the globe and broadcasts the information 
via  EMWIN.  Emergency  management  groups  and  municipal  agencies  receive 
EMWIN  data  from  the  satellite  and  retransmit  it  on  local  radio  frequencies.  State 
and  local  agencies  select  the  information  to  fit  their  specific  area.  The  EMWIN 
datastream is rebroadcast by the University of Hawaii over the PEACESAT satellite 
covering  much  of  the  Pacific  Ocean  including  remote  Pacific  islands.  In  some  small 
island countries, it is the most reliable way to get forecasts and warnings and infor-
mation.  Commercial  software  is  available  to  allow  local  computers  to  be  configured 
to trigger alarms for specific hazards. 
RANET 

Advancement  of  communication  and  dissemination  capacities  in  developing  coun-
tries for purposes of tsunami and other hazards warning is being addressed in part 
through  the  NOAA  and  USAID  Office  of  Foreign  Disaster  Assistance  supported 
Radio  and  Internet  (RANET)  program.  RANET  works  to  develop  dissemination  ca-
pacities for distribution of critical weather and climate information to rural and re-
mote  populations  in  developing  countries.  This  program  is  active  throughout  Africa 
and the Pacific, and activities are expected to begin in late spring and early summer 
in  Asia.  The  RANET  program  utilizes  WorldSpace  digital  satellite  broadcast  capac-
ity, provided through the not-for-profit First Voice International, to deliver a variety 
of graphic and text based information to national weather services and remote field 
offices  anywhere  in  Africa,  Central  Asia,  South  Asia,  Southeast  Asia,  and  the  Pa-
cific.  The  broadcast  on  the  AsiaStar  and  AfriStar  WorldSpace  satellites  is  a  com-
prehensive  suite  of  weather  forecasts,  observations,  bulletins,  and  related  informa-
tion. RANET ties this broadcast capacity to traditional FM and HF radio broadcasts, 
as well as other networks. In response to the December 26, 2004, tsunami disaster, 
RANET  is  working  with  the  Pacific  Tsunami  Warning  Center  to  develop  a  ‘global’ 
cell  phone  based  SMS/text  messaging  service.  Technical  development  of  the  system 
was completed on February 14, 2005, and it is now undergoing a series of tests be-
fore  being  formally  announced.  The  service  will  provide  notification  to  foreign  gov-
ernment  officials  and  those  appointed  by  a  country  point-of-contact  when  bulletins 
from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and other centers are released. Similarly, 
RANET is developing a web-based alert notification system. While receiving activity 
support  and  coordination,  RANET  is  not  currently  provided  operational  resources. 
Dissemination of Tsunami Warning Information to the Public 

The  NOAA  National  Weather  Service  (NWS)  Richard  H.  Hagemeyer  Pacific  Tsu-
nami Warning Center (PTWC) disseminates bulletins by a variety of methods to (1) 
eliminate  single  points  of  failure,  and  (2)  to  reach  all  of  its  clients.  PTWC  relies 
heavily  on  the  established  communications  infrastructure  used  by  the  weather  side 
of  the  NWS.  Bulletins  are  sent  via  a  dedicated  circuit  to  the  NWS  Telecommuni-
cations Gateway (NWSTG) in Silver Springs, Maryland, and from there they are for-
warded into the Advanced Weather Information Processing System and delivered to 
NWS  Forecast  Offices.  From  NWS  Forecast  Offices  tsunami  information  is  relayed 
into  the  NOAA  Weather  Radio  (NWR)  and  Emergency  Alert  System  (EAS)  when 
necessary.  Bulletins  are  also  forwarded  from  the  National  Weather  Service  Tele-
communications  Gateway  (NWSTG)  into  the  World  Meteorological  Organization’s 
Global  Telecommunications  System  for  delivery  to  weather  offices  worldwide.  Bul-

99

letins  are  also  forwarded  from  the  NWSTG  into  the  Emergency  Managers  Weather 
Information  Network  (EMWIN)  for  delivery  over  the  GOES  and  PEACESAT  sat-
ellites to many places including remote Pacific islands. PTWC bulletins are also sent 
to  the  NWSTG  over  the  NOAA  Weather  Wire  System  (NWWS),  a  satellite  based 
system with a 2-way dish at PTWC. In addition to providing a redundant path from 
PTWC  to  the  NWSTG,  the  NWWS  provides  NWS  products  including  tsunami  bul-
letins  to  a  variety  of  customers,  including  the  media,  via  an  NWS  program  called 
the  Family  of  Services  (FOS).  Television  stations  in  Hawaii,  for  example,  subscribe 
to  an  Associated  Press  (AP)  feed  over  which  they  receive  PTWC  bulletins.  The  AP 
receives  its  weather  information  from  multiple  NWS  forecast  and  warning  dissemi-
nation systems to help ensure high reliability. PTWC sends tsunami information to 
the U.S. Armed Forces via a legacy dial-out GateGuard terminal delivering the bul-
letins  via  the  AUTODIN  system  to  approximately  200  commands.  PTWC  also  in-
forms  the  Pacific  Command  of  U.S.  Forces  and  the  Navy  Command  Center  for  the 
Hawaii Region by telephone. PTWC also sends its bulletins to approximately 30 air-
fields  and  other  locations  in  the  Pacific  over  the  Aeronautical  Fixed  Telecommuni-
cations  Network.  In  addition,  bulletins  are  sent  via  e-mail  to  about  100  addresses 
and via fax to about 20 offices. 

The  procedure  PTWC  has  always  operated  under  is  it  only  provides  tsunami 
warning  guidance  to  national  and  local  authorities.  This  is  no  different  than  for 
other  natural  disasters,  such  as  hurricanes,  floods,  etc.  NWS  provides  the  informa-
tion to decision-makers. Those authorities are then responsible for making decisions 
about  whether  or  not  to  issue  an  evacuation  order,  and  for  disseminating  such  or-
ders  to  the  public.  In  some  cases,  such  as  an  urgent  local  tsunami  warning  in  Ha-
waii,  the  issuance  of  evacuation  orders  with  sirens  sounding  and  an  activation  of 
the  EAS  and  NWR  (by  the  NWS  Honolulu  Forecast  Office  in  response  to  a  PTWC 
bulletin)  is  pre-approved  by  State  Civil  Defense  (SCD)  in  the  interest  of  time  when 
minutes and seconds count. But in other cases such as a distant tsunami approach-
ing  Hawaii,  SCD  may  consult  with  its  own  tsunami  advisors  and  control  the 
issuance  and  timing  of  any  evacuation.  Local  authority  for  evacuations  is  critical 
since  PTWC  warnings  to  various  parts  of  the  Pacific,  being  based  initially  on  only 
the seismic data, have a high false alarm rate. It could be very confusing to the pub-
lic if PTWC issued evacuation guidance to a region, but local authorities in that re-
gion had decided not to evacuate. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN MCCAIN TO

DR. JOHN H. MARBURGER, III 

Question.  What  actions  are  being  taken  by  the  U.S.  in  response  to  the  health 

threats that continue to exist in the affected countries? 

Answer. My office, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, is not coordinating 
the U.S. response to health threats in the affected countries. However, I have asked 
the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Defense 
(DoD),  and  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (HHS)  to  provide  de-
tailed  information  on  their  response  to  health  threats,  which  are  described  below. 
In  addition,  I  have  asked  NASA  to  summarize  its  less  direct,  but  nevertheless  im-
portant, contributions through satellite imaging. 
USAID 

USAID/Office  of  U.S.  Foreign  Disaster  Assistance  (OFDA)  has  provided  over  $30 
million  to  non-governmental  organizations  (NGOs)  and  international  organizations 
to provide assistance in health, water/sanitation, and psychological and social activi-
ties.  OFDA  has  provided  $8  million  to  NGOs  and  international  organizations  for 
health  sector  programs  (excluding  psychological  and  social  activities,  and  water/
sanitation).  OFDA  funded  partners  have  provided  mobile  health  clinics  and  field 
hospitals,  rehabilitated  primary  health  care  clinics  and  hospitals,  and  provided 
medicines  and  emergency  health  care  supplies.  In  addition,  OFDA-funded  inter-
national organizations are tracking patterns of life-threatening diseases, and assist-
ing in the control of communicable diseases through surveillance and early warning 
systems,  immunization,  distribution  of  hygiene  kits,  and  health/hygiene  education. 
USAID/OFDA  has  provided  $17  million  to  organizations  for  water  and  sanitation 
activities  to  ensure  sanitary  conditions  and  access  to  potable  drinking  water  for  af-
fected  populations.  Partner  activities  include  construction  of  latrines,  provision  of 
containers  for  transportation  of  water  and  water  storage  bladders,  disinfection  of 
water sources, water purification and treatment, hygiene education, and distribution 
of hygiene kits.

In addition to the traditional emergency health activities, OFDA is supporting or-
ganizations that are carrying out interventions to mitigate the psychological trauma 
of  the  tsunami.  OFDA  is  providing  funding  in  India,  Sri  Lanka,  and  Indonesia  for 
programs that provide psychological and social support for survivors of the tsunami. 
Total  support  for  these  activities  totals  approximately  $5.2  million.  We  have  given 
particular  attention  to  the  needs  of  children  and  are  supporting  several  organiza-
tions  that  are  facilitating  structured  activities  for  children  and  adolescents,  often 
through  child-centered  spaces.  These  activities  are  being  implemented  in  internally 
displaced  persons  (IDP)  program  settlements  and  tsunami-affected  communities 
alike. 

OFDA is currently funding the following organizations to implement Health, Psy-
chological  and  Social,  and  Water/Sanitation  programs  benefiting  tsunami-affected 
populations:

USAID  is  also  considering  proposals  from  NGOs  and  others  and  working  to  re-
spond  to  the  needs  assessments  being  developed  for  the  region.  For  additional  de-
tails, see the INDIAN OCEAN—Earthquake and Tsunamis Fact Sheet, available on 
the USAID website (http://www.usaid.gov/locations/asialnearleast/tsunami). 
DoD 

The  Defense  Department  has  dispatched  the  medical  ship  USNS  Mercy  off  the 
coast of Banda Aceh Indonesia. This medical ship is staffed by a unique combination 
of  military  personnel  and  American  volunteers  from  the  medical  community  coordi-
nated  by  the  NGO  Project  HOPE.  In  coordination  with  the  Government  of  Indo-
nesia,  the  military  staff  and  volunteers  are  providing  state  of  the  art  medical  serv-
ices  to  those  patients  that  cannot  be  treated  by  the  hospitals  on  shore.  They  are 
also  providing  consultation  services,  limited  training,  and  bioengineering  repair 
services in hospitals on shore. 
HHS 

HHS  has  deployed  54  employees  to  the  region,  including  four  people  assigned  to 
the  U.S.  Disaster  Assistance  Response  Teams,  as  well  as  Centers  for  Disease  Con-
trol  and  Prevention  (CDC)  epidemiologists  and  field  staff  in  Indonesia,  Thailand, 
and Sri Lanka. They are assisting with activities related to vaccine-preventable dis-
eases, childhood injuries and trauma, malaria control, health and nutrition, mental 
health, rapid needs assessment, and response coordination. Among the diseases that 
are  being  monitored  are  cholera,  dysentery,  malaria  and  typhoid  fever.  In  addition, 
HHS staff are assisting the Department of Defense aboard the USNS Mercy. 

Since  late  December,  CDC  staff  in  Thailand  and  India,  where  HHS  has  ongoing 
programs,  have  been  assisting  local  health  and  other  officials,  under  the  direction 
of  the  respective  U.S.  embassies.  Their  activities  include  assessing  health  needs, 
monitoring for diseases, and documenting the dead and missing. HHS scientists are 
assisting  teams  led  by  Department  of  Defense,  the  State  Department  and  inter-
national organizations. HHS officials in the United States are in daily contact with 
American, international and local officials involved in the tsunami response.

HHS  is  working  with  other  agencies  of  the  U.S.  government  planning  for  the  re-

covery and reconstruction phase of the tsunami response. 
NASA 

NASA  satellite  observations  and  predictions  of  Earth  processes  are  being  used  to 
support  human  health  aid  programs  in  the  tsunami  affected  regions  and  elsewhere 
in  the  world.  Health  factors  that  are  measurable  from  NASA  research  instruments 
include, air and water contaminants, ambient temperature extremes, ultra-violet ra-
diation  and  a  myriad  of  other  factors  that  contribute  to  our  knowledge  of  public 
health  challenges.  NASA  collaborates  to  expand  the  use  of  Earth  observing  instru-
ments, advanced communication technology, high speed computing capabilities, data 
products,  and  predictive  models  associated  with  the  occurrence  of  disease  to  assist 
partners in enhancing their surveillance systems. 

For  example,  NASA’s  Socioeconomic  Data  and  Applications  Center  (SEDAC)  is 
working with the Geographic Information Support Team (GIST), which includes rep-
resentatives from the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), the UN Of-
fice  for  the  Coordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs  (OCHA),  the  World  Bank,  the 
World  Food  Programme  (WFP),  the  UK  Department  for  International  Development 
(DFID), the World Health Organization (WHO), and others. This group is providing 
access to key geospatial data needed by working teams in the field. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO

DR. JOHN H. MARBURGER, III 

Question. Dr. Marburger, confronted with a fresh reminder of the potential devas-
tation of an off-shore, tsunami-causing earthquake, I share Senator Stevens’ concern 
about  ensuring  sufficient  warning  systems  are  in  place  so  that  loss  of  human  life 
can be minimized. Thank you for the outline you provided in your written testimony 
of the generic components for a successful disaster detection, warning, and reduction 
system. Senator Stevens requested an estimation of what it would take to establish 
a  comprehensive  tsunami  notification  system,  such  as  the  one  you  outlined  in  your 
testimony.  I  am  very  interested  in  your  response  and  ask  that  you  please  forward 
me a copy of your answer to Senator Stevens’ question. 

Answer. I share your concern that the citizens of the U.S. have sufficient warning 
of any tsunami event on our shores. In fact, tsunami warnings are a part of a larger 
effort  to  provide  warnings  for  all  natural  and  human-caused  disasters  within  the 
U.S. 

The  responses  to  Senator  Stevens’  question  come  mostly  from  the  agencies 
charged with the development of a comprehensive tsunami notification system. The 
U.S.  already  has  significant  warning  capabilities  for  a  variety  of  severe  weather 
events  and  other  emergencies.  For  example,  I  have  attached  an  extended  excerpt 
from a letter submitted by NOAA Administrator Lautenbacher in response to ques-
tions  by  Senators  Stevens  and  Inouye  in  which  the  current  warning  capabilities  of 
the  U.S.  are  summarized  nicely.  We  believe  that  the  efforts  of  the  Department  of 
Commerce (NOAA), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Science Foun-
dation  (NSF),  and  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (FEMA)  are  effective  and 
should  continue  their  development.  The  next  steps  in  this  process  are  outlined  in 
the  fact  sheet  that  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy  released  (copy  at-
tached) describing the Administration’s immediate steps to strengthen the U.S. tsu-
nami  detection  and  warning  capabilities  in  the  Pacific  Ocean,  Atlantic  Ocean,  and 
Caribbean  Sea.  Furthermore  we  have  assembled  an  interagency  working  group 
under the National Science and Technology Council to provide the detailed planning 
and  identification  of  responsibilities  to  implement  these  improvements.  This  group 
will issue a detailed plan by mid-summer. 

In addition, the evolving emergency notification situations following the events of 
September 11, 2001 have motivated us to create an interagency effort to coordinate 
the  activities  with  the  Federal  Government  that  deal  with  emergency  warnings. 
This  new  group  is  now  being  formed  under  the  National  Science  and  Technology 
Council  and  will  be  called  the  Task  Force  on  Effective  Warnings.  This  Task  Force 
will be charged with examining both natural disaster warnings and homeland secu-
rity warnings, and to will examine and make recommendations about disaster warn-
ing/communication systems, networks or facilities to provide effective disaster warn-

rity into a single ‘‘all hazards’’ warning system for the people of the U.S.

Excerpt  from  letter  to  Senators  Stevens  and  Inouye  from  Vice  Admiral 

Conrad C. Lautenbacher on February 22, 2005: 

102

NOAA’s National Weather Service (NWS) is acknowledged as the premier agency 
in  government  for  disseminating  warning  information.  We  are  efficient  at  dissemi-
nating  weather  and  natural  hazard  information  through  our  vast  communication 
network.  We  currently  provide  public  notification  of  weather  warnings  as  well  as 
other natural hazards and disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and civil emer-
gency  messages,  e.g.,  hazardous  materials  spills.  These  warnings  can  be  received 
and  transmitted  by  a  myriad  of  other  users  providing  access  to  virtually  all  of  the 
people across the Nation. We can provide access, but we cannot ensure the message 
is received. 

While our system is effective, we can still make improvements. We can make our 
systems  more  reliable  and  improve  public  education.  We  can  work  with  the  private 
sector  to  utilize  new  technology  to  make  warnings  available,  and  develop  other 
methods to increase accessibility of warnings. 

NOAA  Weather,  Alert,  and  Readiness  Network  (NOAA  WARN),  includes  all 
NOAA’s National Weather Service warning dissemination systems (see attachment). 
This  includes  the  NOAA  Weather  Radio  All  Hazards  (NWR)  program,  which  con-
sists of over 900 radio transmitters covering nearly 97 percent of the nation’s popu-
lation.  The  President’s  FY06  Budget  request  includes  funds  to  modernize  64  of  400 
remaining  vintage  1970’s  NWR  transmitters.  These  improvements  will  make  them 
more robust by including backup power supply, and make them easier to maintain. 
Backup  power  is  critical  during  major  weather  events,  such  as  hurricanes,  when 
commercial power is out. 

Our  assessment  and  decision-making  equipment,  the  Advanced  Weather  Inter-
active  Processing  System  (AWIPS),  is  the  initial  generation  point  for  all  NWS  dis-
seminated warnings. We are working to ensure AWIPS has appropriate software ca-
pabilities, capable of disseminating new information technology standard formats, to 
effectively  support  the  new  technologies  such  as  Geophysical  Information  Systems 
(GIS) and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). 

Issuing  weather  and  water  related  warnings  (including  tsunamis)  are  the  cul-
mination  of  a  complex  process,  beginning  with  observations,  analysis,  and  interpre-
tation,  and  culminating  with  disseminating  the  warning.  NOAA’s  NWS  maintains 
a  complex  infrastructure  of  people  and  technology  to  create,  and  then  issue  those 
warnings. It is our mission. It is what we do. 

Issuing civil emergency warnings or earthquake warnings has a different process. 
NWS  serves  as  a  dissemination  service  for  these  warnings.  We  rely  on  communica-
tion  processing,  which  is  automated  for  earthquake  warnings,  and  is  being  auto-
mated  for  federal,  state  and  local  civil  emergency  messages.  For  these  civil  emer-
gency  messages  to  be  disseminated,  we  need  to  ensure  agreements  are  in  place  to 
allow  access  to  NOAA  dissemination  systems.  In  June  2004,  the  Department  of 
Homeland Security (DHS) and NOAA signed a Memorandum of Agreement allowing 
DHS  to  use  the  NOAA  Weather  Radio  All  Hazards  network  to  disseminate  civil 
emergency messages. 

Once  warnings  are  in  NOAA  WARN,  they  are  automatically  transmitted  to  the 
Emergency Alert System (EAS; for wide distribution in real and near-real time), the 
NWS  dissemination  network,  and  through  other  private  and  public  dissemination 
systems.  NOAA  WARN  systems  include  NWR,  NOAA  Weather  Wire,  NOAAPort, 
Emergency  Managers  Weather  Information  Network  (EMWIN),  and  the  Internet. 
Most local and all national media outlets have links to NOAA’s NWS dissemination 
network to receive warning information. 

Warning  messages  from  NOAA’s  NWS  activate  the  EAS  and  also  reach  the  pri-
vate  sector,  which  rebroadcast  the  emergency  information  via  television,  radio, 
internet  (e.g.,  email  warnings),  pagers,  and  in  some  cases  PDAs  and  cell  phones. 
Through  this  warning  system,  all  appropriate  federal  and  local  emergency  officials 
have access to the warning information and can receive warnings. 

Newer technology (e.g., cell phones, reverse 911, PDA’s, pagers) can receive warn-
ing  information,  but  most  are  set  up  to  do  so  only  when  requested  by  the  user  or 
as  a  subscription  service.  There  is  no  federal,  state  or  local  policy  in  place  to  man-
date  redistribution  of  warning  information.  While  there  are  some  technical  chal-
lenges  to  alert,  for  example,  every  cell  phone  within  a  certain  area,  it  is  possible. 
The difficulty with broadcast cell phone warnings is there are no national standards. 
NOAA  will  continue  to  work  with  appropriate  public  and  private  entities  to  ensure 
warning information is available in industry standard formats for ease of interoper-
ability. 

NOAA  and  DHS  have  ongoing  discussions  with  satellite  communications  opera-
tors, such as XM Satellite Radio, who already have a channel devoted to emergency

messages.  This  method  to  deliver  warnings  shows  promise,  with  the  only  reserva-
tion at this point the limited number of users. 

Effective dissemination of public warning notification requires using existing sys-
tems  and  infrastructure  where  possible  and  public  education  and  outreach  to  rec-
ommend  what  actions  to  take  once  the  warnings  are  issued.  For  example,  USGS 
uses  the  NWS  infrastructure  to  disseminate  earthquake  messages  and,  as  stated 
above,  DHS  also  has  access  to  NWR  to  disseminate  warnings.  This  is  an  efficient 
use of government infrastructure. All federal agencies involved in warning the pub-
lic  need  to  continue  to  work  together  to  leverage  available  assets.  NOAA  has  been 
working  with  DHS,  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC),  and  other 
agencies  within  the  Department  of  Commerce  to  help  coordinate  the  federal  effort 
on a consolidated warning system to ensure the public is able to receive emergency 
messages. This dialogue will continue. 

For  example,  NWS  is  working  with  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency 
(FEMA) on a system to streamline the ability of pre-approved and authenticated of-
ficials at federal, state, and local levels to submit messages for broadcast over NWS 
systems.  The  NWS  received  funds  in  the  FY  2004  Omnibus  Appropriations  Act  to 
streamline and automate the current manual creation, authentication, and collection 
of  all  types  of  non-weather  emergency  messages  in  a  quick  and  secure  fashion  for 
subsequent alert, warning, and notification purposes. HazCollect, as the new system 
is  known,  will  function  through  FEMA’s  Disaster  Management  Interoperability 
Service (DMIS). All weather and non-weather emergency messages will be available 
on  the  DMIS  backbone  network  for  national,  state  and  local  dissemination  through 
myriad public and private sector systems. 

Essential  to  any  effective  warning  system  is  education  and  outreach.  NOAA’s 
NWS has two programs to help ensure local communities can receive warning infor-
mation  they  need—StormReady  and  TsunamiReady.  These  programs  focus  on  pre-
paredness  and  education  activities  to  make  sure  local  communities  can  take  appro-
priate steps once the warning information is received. One of the criteria for a com-
munity  to  be  certified  as  Storm  Ready  is  to  have  in  place  alternate  and  redundant 
ways  to  receive  warnings.  For  example,  an  emergency  operations  center  may  have 
Internet  notification  as  well  as  NWR  as  their  methods  to  receive  warnings.  Receiv-
ing warnings through multiple systems reduces the possibility of missing critical in-
formation. 

NOAA is working with DHS and other federal, state and local agencies to increase 
usage of NWR and expand the use of new and emerging technology to deliver warn-
ings. Timeliness is always a factor, but existing NWS dissemination systems trans-
mit  warnings  usually  within  seconds.  Redistribution  through  EAS  is  also  quick. 
However, the Nation needs a federal lead agency for a nationwide warning system, 
using a common message standard. We believe DHS/FEMA is the appropriate agen-
cy  to  lead  such  an  effort,  and  must  build  on  existing  warning  systems,  such  as 
NOAA WARN, to create a warning ‘‘system of systems.’’

American territories, such as American Samoa, do not have an extensive commu-
nications  infrastructure.  NOAA  is  working  with  these  communities  and  our  inter-
national partners to ensure warning information is communicated to government of-
ficials. Much communication is done through the Emergency Managers Weather In-
formation Network (EMWIN) and Radio and Internet (RANET) systems. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARK PRYOR TO

DR. JOHN H. MARBURGER, III 

The questions voiced by Senator Pryor reflect concern and interest in the success 
and effectiveness of existing warning mechanisms and the likelihood that these sys-
tems  will  get  better  in  the  future.  I  share  those  concerns  and  have  assembled  an 
interagency  working  group  under  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council  to 
gather  together  the  agencies  working  on  tsunami  warning  systems  to  provide  the 
detailed  planning  and  identification  of  responsibilities  to  implement  these  improve-
ments.  This  group  will  issue  a  detailed  plan  by  mid-summer  and  we  will  follow  up 
with the agencies to ensure effective implementation. 

The  specific  questions  submitted  by  Senator  Pryor  are  identical  to  the  questions 
submitted  to  NOAA.  Since  NOAA  is  the  agency  responsible  for  managing  the 
TsunamiReady  Program  and  is  primarily  responsible  for  instituting  any  needed 
changes  in  the  U.S.  tsunami  warning  system,  I  will  defer  to  NOAA’s  detailed  re-
sponses to these questions, listed here.

Voice Sirens for Effective, Reliable Tsunami Warning 

104

Question  1.  Effective  tsunami  warning  should  rely  on  a  variety  of  redundant 
modes  of  communication.  While  there  are  several  technologies  for  communicating 
tsunami  warnings  highlighted  in  the  Tsunami  Preparedness  Act  of  2005  (S.  50),  it 
is  a  concern  that  voice  capable  sirens  are  not  among  the  technologies  mentioned. 
Emergency managers have long depended on sirens to warn the public of emergency 
and  civil  defense  situations  including  tsunamis,  tornados,  floods,  hurricanes,  haz-
ardous material accidents, and of a potential nuclear attack. 

Sirens have a number of significant advantages: they insure that all residents and 
visitors  to  a  particular  area  can  be  informed  without  regard  to  the  cell  phone  or 
pager  technology  platform  or  provider  they  may  have,  when  equipped  with  backup 
power  supplies  they  will  work  even  when  the  electricity  or  phone  lines  are  out; 
when  equipped  with  live  public  address  or  pre-recorded  messages  they  can  be  used 
BEFORE and AFTER the incident to communicate important public safety informa-
tion. 

Without the use of/installation of voice sirens as part of a preparedness plan, how 
do you warn people on the ground? Are there other effective warning systems avail-
able  for  this  purpose?  What  criteria  are  used  to  determine  which  warning  system 
is reliable in case of tsunami? 

Answer.  NOAA  works  with  the  emergency  management  community  to  ensure 
warnings  are  received  by  the  public  in  as  many  ways  as  possible—including  cell 
phones,  pagers,  Internet,  NOAA  Weather  Radio  All-Hazards,  television,  radio,  and 
sirens. All of these methods are effective, and emergency managers must decide how 
to  best  warn  the  public.  NOAA’s  dissemination  systems  are  available  for  the  emer-
gency  management  community  to  use  in  broadcasting  emergency  messages.  NOAA 
will  continue  working  with  federal,  state  and  local  emergency  managers  to  ensure 
warnings  are  as  widely  distributed  as  possible.  Some  National  Weather  Service  Of-
fices  also  issue  tsunami  warnings  via  High  Frequency  (HF)  and  Very  High  Fre-
quency  (VHF)  marine  radio  as  well,  as  do  other  federal  agencies.  There  are  no 
unique criteria for determining which warning systems are reliable for tsunamis.

Question 1a. Should a preparedness plan include a warning mechanism for small 
fishing  boats  trawling  near  the  coastline?  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Ad-
ministration  (NOAA)  weather  radios  can  be  used  to  inform  these  fishing  boats  at 
minimal cost (approximately $20). 

Answer.  A  comprehensive  preparedness  plan  must  address  how  to  get  messages 
to people, whenever they need it, wherever they are. NOAA Weather Radio All-Haz-
ards is an effective way to reach fishing boats near the coast. There are other alter-
natives  available  as  well,  including  satellite  based  communications  links  (Internet 
and  cell  phone).  We  employ  all  possible  methods  of  delivering  warnings  to  those  at 
risk. 
Improving Tsunami Prediction and Preparedness 

Question 2. NOAA’s National Weather Service has been able to mark its progress 
in  severe  weather  prediction  and  forecasting  with  a  number  of  useful  metrics.  For 
example, they have substantially increased warning times for hurricanes and torna-
does,  while  at  the  same  time  increasing  accuracy  of  forecasts.  Unlike  these  events, 
tsunamis are caused by largely unpredictable tectonic events that can strike without 
warning,  which  makes  improving  prediction  a  bit  harder.  However,  it  is  important 
that  we  use  the  same  approach  to  improving  out  tsunami  prediction  and  warnings. 
One  way  we  have  started  to  characterize  our  success  is  a  75  percent  reduction  in 
false  alarms  since  1996.  This  is  indeed  an  accomplishment.  But  we  also  want  to 
make  sure  that  when  a  deadly  tsunami  is  headed  for  our  coasts,  we  have  the  best 
information possible for our communities on time, place and severity. 

What  kind  of  progress  have  we  made  in  accuracy  of  forecasting  and  prediction 

since 1996? What is a good measure of such progress? 

Answer. Tsunamis often result from unpredictable seismic events that strike with-
out  warning.  It  is  a  challenge  to  improving  the  prediction  of  tsunami-genesis.  With 
each  tornado  or  hurricane,  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration 
(NOAA)  collects  a  tremendous  amount  of  data.  We  are  able  to  learn  new  things 
about  these  natural  disasters  with  every  event;  this  information  aids  us  in  our  ef-
forts  to  improve  prediction.  Fortunately,  tsunamis  are  relatively  infrequent.  That 
means  we  record  fewer  events  and  have  much  we  can  learn  when  it  comes  to  tsu-
nami  generation  and  propagation.  Understanding  how  these  natural  disasters  de-
velop is key to determining how we can predict these destructive events. 

The Administration’s plan calls for NOAA to have a network of 39 advanced-tech-
nology Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) buoys for a fully 
operational  enhanced  tsunami  warning  system  by  mid-2007.  With  a  complete  net-
work of DART stations, we will have the opportunity to detect more tsunami events, 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  13:59 Nov 17, 2005 Jkt 022845 PO 00000 Frm 00108 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\22845.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

105

and  we  have  the  opportunity  to  learn  from  each  one.  In  November  2003,  a  large 
earthquake  occurred  in  the  Aleutian  Islands  and  generated  a  tsunami.  The  DART 
stations recorded this event, confirming only a small tsunami. During post analysis 
of the event, DART data were used for a model simulation and the output from the 
simulation  accurately  predicted  the  2  cm  tsunami  recorded  at  Hilo,  Hawaii.  With 
each tsunami-event recorded by the DART stations, we have the opportunity to fine-
tune  our  models  used  to  predict  tsunami  impacts.  The  DART  data  combined  with 
forecast  models  promise  to  significantly  reduce  false  alarm  rates  as  well  as  provide 
a  better  measure  of  the  severity  of  destructive  tsunamis  for  Hawaii  and  all  other 
parts  of  the  Pacific.  The  accurate  forecasting  of  a  non-destructive  tsunami  in  No-
vember  2003  saved  Hawaii  an  estimated  $68M  in  projected  evacuation  costs.  With 
the additional DART stations, we expect to substantially reduce false alarm rate for 
distant tsunamis from 75 percent to less than 25 percent over the next 4 years. Lit-
tle  change  is  expected  in  reducing  false  alarms  for  local  tsunamis  (those  generated 
from near-shore causes). A reduction in the rate of false alarms, and the associated 
cost-savings for our states and territories, is an appropriate measure of our progress 
in tsunami detection.

Question 2a. What other metrics will be important to pay attention to? For exam-
ple,  only  30  percent  of  our  communities  at  risk  have  inundation  maps—shouldn’t 
this  percentage  improve?  How  much  will  this  metric  improve  with  the  funds  pro-
posed under the President’s plan? 

Answer.  NOAA  agrees  that  the  percentage  of  at-risk  communities  with  complete 
inundation  maps  is  an  important  metric,  and  we  are  working  to  increase  the  num-
ber  of  areas  covered  by  inundation  maps.  Another  important  metric  is  the  number 
of  at-risk  communities  that  are  ‘‘TsunamiReady.’’  NOAA’s  TsunamiReady  program 
promotes  tsunami  hazard  preparedness  as  an  active  collaboration  among  federal, 
state  and  local  emergency  management  agencies,  the  public,  and  NOAA’s  National 
Weather Service tsunami warning system. The Administration’s plan provides fund-
ing  to  allow  NOAA  to  increase  the  number  of  mapped  and  TsunamiReady  commu-
nities.  Of  the  $24M  scheduled  for  NOAA  use,  approximately  $4.75M  will  be  spent 
on inundation mapping and modeling, as well as education and outreach (e.g., com-
munity  preparedness  activities,  including  TsunamiReady).  Of  this  $4.75M,  approxi-
mately  $2.25M  will  be  spent  on  inundation  mapping  and  modeling  and  $2.5M  will 
go towards public education activities. Following the current plan, inundation map-
ping for the major population centers will be complete in 2015.

Question  2b.  Since  we  have  experienced  a  50  percent  decline  in  buoy  service  in 
the  past  2  years,  wouldn’t  this  be  another  metric  to  focus  on?  What  will  be  your 
goal? 

Answer.  It  is  not  accurate  to  say  that  we  have  experienced  a  50  percent  decline 
in  buoy  service  in  the  past  2  years.  We  believe  you  are  referring  to  technical  mal-
functions  of  3  of  the  6  DART  buoys  in  the  weeks  preceding  the  hearing.  While  it 
is  true  that  at  the  time  of  the  hearing,  2  of  the  6  DART  stations  were  offline,  this 
does not indicate a 50 percent decline in performance over the last 2 years. The reli-
ability  of  the  DART  stations,  since  October  2003,  the  time  when  they  were 
transitioned  from  being  operated  by  NOAA  Research  to  NOAA’s  National  Weather 
Service,  has  been  72  percent.  This  percentage  represents  the  combined  number  of 
hours  the  stations  have  been  operational,  and  is  an  appropriate  metric  to  use  in 
evaluating  the  reliability  of  the  DART  system.  Further,  this  percentage  indicates 
that the DART station array is a highly effective system overall. 

Our  goal  is  to  have  a  fully  capable  network  of  29  DART  stations  in  the  Pacific, 
with  3  additional  in-water  backups  in  the  Gulf  of  Alaska,  where  sea  conditions  are 
particularly  harsh.  While  it  is  not  possible  to  guarantee  that  these  prototype  sta-
tions  will  be  operational  100  percent  of  the  time  given  the  demanding  environ-
mental  conditions  in  which  these  stations  operate,  NOAA  is  focused  making  the 
DART  I  network  more  robust  and  deploying  a  DART  II  network  with  reliability 
built  into  the  design.  NOAA  plans  for  the  network  to  meet  operational  require-
ments,  even  with  occasional  DART  station  outages.  NOAA  will  develop  capabilities 
to address network coverage and redundancy to ensure, as best we can, that single 
DART  station  failures  will  not  impact  the  integrity  of  the  entire  network.  Planned 
redundancy  and  hardening  of  the  infrastructure,  combined  with  the  addition  of  a 
two-way communication capability, will mitigate risk from system-wide failures. 
Funding for Tsunami Mitigation and Response 

Question  3.  The  Administration  recently  released  its  plan  to  expand  and  mod-
ernize  its  tsunami  detection  and  warning  system.  This  plan  includes  the  expansion 
of the system into areas such as the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico. 
I applaud the Administration’s timely response, however, I am concerned that while

106

the  plan  addresses  the  issue  of  tsunami  detection,  it  does  not  completely  address 
the issue of response to tsunami, as well as community preparation. 

Which agency will be taking the lead for mitigation, mapping, and response? 
Answer. NOAA, FEMA and USGS, through the National Tsunami Hazard Mitiga-
tion Program, coordinate inundation mapping efforts with state and local emergency 
management  officials.  FEMA  is  the  lead  agency  for  mitigation  and  response,  with 
NOAA  assisting  any  way  possible.  NOAA’s  role  is  to  assist  in  identifying  the  tsu-
nami  hazard  (required  inundation  mapping),  providing  tsunami  warning  guidance 
(including  site-specific  tsunami  forecast  models)  and  providing  tsunami  mitigation 
program  support  though  community-based  preparedness  programs  and  education 
outreach—including the TsunamiReady Program.

Question 3a. Does the funding proposed by the Administration include funding for 

tsunami response? How much? 

to answer this question.

Answer. FEMA is the lead federal agency in the response area and is best suited 

Question  3b.  Will  these  amounts  be  adequate  given  the  plans  for  expanded  areas 

of coverage for the tsunami program? 

Answer. NOAA funding for mitigation includes $2.5 million for education and out-
reach and $2.25M for inundation mapping. This is a significant increase from prior 
year funding levels managed through the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Pro-
gram.  FEMA  is  the  primary  federal  agency  in  the  response  area  and  is  best  suited 
to answer that portion of this question.

RESPONSE TO LETTER DATED FEBRUARY 7, 2005 FROM CHAIRMAN STEVENS AND

CO-CHAIRMAN INOUYE TO DR. ARDEN L. BEMENT, JR. 

In  response  to  a  letter,  dated  February  7,  2005  from  Chairman  Ted  Stevens  and 

Co-Chairman Daniel K. Inouye, asking to: 

Please  explain  what  information  or  resources  your  agency  requires  before  it  can 
issue  a  public  warning  notification  of  a  natural  hazard  or  disaster.  In  addition,  we 
would  like  to  know  which  entities  or  organizations  receive  warnings  from,  or 
through,  your  agency,  such  as  the  appropriate  federal  and  local  disaster  response 
entities,  first  responders/911,  and  local  and  national  media  outlets.  To  the  extent 
possible,  your  report  should  also  demonstrate  which  communications  technologies 
are  currently  used  to  deliver  these  public  warnings,  such  as  automatic  alert  tele-
visions  and  radios,  telephones,  wireless  and  satellite  technology,  including  cellular 
telephones, pagers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and the internet. If such com-
munications  technologies  are  not  being  used,  we  would  like  to  know  what  the  im-
pediments  are,  and  the  status  of  any  discussions  to  expand  the  warning  system’s 
capability to do so. 

Your report should also specify a process by which your agency, either on its own, 
or in conjunction with other relevant agencies, can maximize effective dissemination 
of  public  warning  notifications.  Lastly,  we  would  be  interested  to  know  how  your

POTENTIAL ENHANCEMENTS TO THE GLOBAL SEISMOGRAPHIC NETWORK (GSN) 

Background 

Over  the  past  20  years,  the  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF),  through  funding 
to the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) Consortium, has es-
tablished the 137-station Global Seismographic Network (GSN). This network serves 
as  the  primary  international  source  of  data  for  earthquake  location  and  tsunami 
warning. Although the establishment of the GSN is an NSF-supported function and 
the  acquisition  of  GSN  equipment  is  solely  supported  through  the  NSF,  the  GSN-
station operation is shared with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), which supports 
the  maintenance  of  approximately  2/3  of  the  network.  The  GSN  infrastructure  in-
cludes  not  only  the  in  situ  observing  stations,  but  also  global  telemetry,  and  data 
collection  and  distribution  through  the  IRIS  Data  Management  System.  The  Data 
Management  System,  in  addition  to  being  the  primary  world  repository  for  seismic 
data, analysis tools, and visualization software, provides an essential quality-control 
function  for  the  GSN  hardware  and  communication  links  that  are  so  vital  to  real-
time hazard warning functions related to earthquakes. 

Real-time GSN data formed the critical core of the early warning of the December 
26,  2004  Sumatran  Earthquake.  Within  8  minutes  of  the  initial  rupture  of  the 
M=9.0 earthquake, GSN data flashed electronically via satellite and the Internet to 
the  GSN  Data  Collection  Center  and  then  to  the  Pacific  Tsunami  Warning  Center 
(PTWC/NOAA)  and  the  National  Earthquake  Information  Center  (NEIC/USGS). 
GSN  seismometers  recorded  with  full-fidelity  the  ultra-long  period  energy  radiated 
by  the  earthquake’s  1000  km  long  rupture.  The  unique  long-period  response  of  the 
GSN  is  the  key  factor  in  providing  an  accurate  measure  of  the  size,  character,  and 
tsunami-potential of such mega-events. 
Potential Enhancements 

Although  the  GSN  system  is  working  very  well,  there  is  much  that  can  be  im-
proved.  Some  of  the  enhancements  that  might  be  possible  with  the  appropriate  re-
sources, over the next five years are: 
(1) Telemetry and Information Technology—Expansion and Reliability 

The  rapid  collection  of  GSN  data  and  distribution  of  earthquake  information  is 
at the heart of an earthquake/tsunami warning system. Over 80 percent of the GSN 
now has real-time telemetry links. However, the means of telemetry are very hetero-
geneous.  These  include  local  Internet  and  telemetry  links  supported  by  local  host 
organizations; Internet infrastructure supported by IRIS and USGS; satellite telem-
etry links supported by IRIS, USGS, National Weather Service, and NSF; and global 
satellite  infrastructure  shared  by  the  Comprehensive  Nuclear  Test  Ban  Treaty  Or-
ganization (CTBTO). To complete GSN telemetry to 100 percent coverage and to en-
hance  low-bandwidth  links,  40  telemetry  links  need  to  be  established  and  main-
tained. 
(2) Expanding Coverage—International and National Cooperation 

Under  NSF  supervision,  the  GSN  and  the  IRIS  Data  Management  System  are 
prepared to work with the international community (in particular Australia, Japan, 
France, India, and China) and U.S. agencies, such as NOAA and USGS, to enhance 
the  GSN  capabilities.  This  includes  the  installation  of  much-needed  stations  on  the 
ocean  floor  to  augment  and  complement  the  land-based  GSN.  As  new  seismic  sta-
tions are proposed and installed in the Indian Ocean region and elsewhere, arrange-
ments need to be made to ensure that these stations will contribute to the GSN sys-
tem. IRIS successfully worked with international organizations and governments to 
establish  similar  networks  in  Kyrghizstan  and  Africa.  The  GSN’s  success  is  predi-
cated on its close relationship with the many local organizations that host the seis-
mic stations. The international Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks (FDSN) 
and  the  Global  Earth  Observing  System  of  Systems  (GEOSS)  provide  appropriate 
pathways  for  international  collaboration.  Needs  include  data  and  information  ex-
change,  shared  telemetry,  joint  stations,  coordination  of  infrastructure  and  the  de-
velopment  of  local  capacity  for  seismological  observations  and  research.  Portable 
seismic  systems  provided  through  IRIS  offer  a  basis  for  collaborative  research 
projects  between  U.S.  Earth  scientists  and  specialists  in  South  Asia  on  the  struc-
ture, dynamics, and seismic hazard of the region.

(3) Long-term Viability of the GSN—Operation and Maintenance

The  Sumatran  earthquake  once  again  points  to  the  importance  of  diligence  in 
maintaining  a  highly  reliable  and  fully  operational  system  at  all  times.  Relation-
ships must be nurtured to improve local help for GSN maintenance and interagency 
support by the NSF and the USGS must be provided on an ongoing basis. 
With the resources at its disposal, the GSN currently operates at about 90 percent 
data  availability.  About  10  percent  of  the  network  (∼14  stations)  is  down  at  any 
given  time,  awaiting  repair.  Increasing  station  uptime  requires  more  field  engineer 
FTE’s and travel support. The GSN equipment is currently spared and refreshed at 
a  yearly  rate  equal  to  5  percent  of  the  total  installed  equipment  base.  Increasing 
station  uptime  will  deplete  spares  more  rapidly,  requiring  an  increased  rate  of 
equipment sparing. 
(4) Sensor Development—Next Generation Ultra-long Period Seismometers 

The  Streckeisen  STS–1,  the  premier  seismometer  used  by  the  GSN  for  recording 
ultra-long  period  Earth  motions,  is  no  longer  manufactured  or  available.  The  infor-
mation  provided  by  this  unique  sensor  is  the  single  key  component  in  determining 
the size, and tsunami potential, of great earthquakes. As these sensors age and fail, 
the  prospect  of  a  decline  in  network  quality  looms  very  real.  That  there  is  no  com-
parable  replacement  for  the  STS–1  is  an  internationally  recognized  problem.  Given 
the  small  market  (<1000)  for  such  exquisite  seismic  sensors,  there  is  no  financial 
motivation for the private sector to undertake such a development. This a potential 
area  for  collaboration  among  groups  at  NSF  involved  in  sensor  design.  The  United 
States has an opportunity to take the lead in developing the next generation ultra-
long period sensor, which serves both tsunami warning and scientific purposes. 

The  NSF  Division  of  Earth  Sciences  has  an  ongoing  Memorandum  of  Under-
standing  (MOU)  with  the  USGS  regarding  joint  operation  and  maintenance  of  the 
Global Seismographic Network, joint support of the Southern California Earthquake 
Center  (SCEC),  and  participation  of  the  USGS  in  the  EarthScope  project.  The  NSF 
also  participates  in  the  National  Earthquake  Hazard  Reduction  Program  (NEHRP) 
with  the  USGS,  FEMA,  and  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology 
(NIST).  NEHRP  fosters  cooperative  activities  with  respect  to  the  nation’s  vulner-
ability  to  earthquake  hazards,  and  fosters  knowledge  transfer  efforts  related  to 
earthquake  hazards.  It  should  be  noted  that  in  addition  to  earthquake/tsunami  re-
search, the NSF also maintains a broad research portfolio relevant to potential haz-
ards  from  volcanic  eruptions,  landslides,  and  hydrological  hazards  such  as  floods, 
droughts,  and  ground-water  contamination.  We  look  forward  to  continuing  these 
interagency  activities.  It  is  certainly  in  the  public  interest  that  efforts  in  amelio-
rating  the  effects  of  natural  hazards  are  improved  by  our  activities  in  fundamental 
research. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO

DR. ARDEN L. BEMENT, JR. 

Question  1.  Please  describe  how  you  expect  the  Ocean  Observatories  Initiative  to 
cooperate  with  other  seismic  research  projects  within  the  Foundation  and  other 
agencies. 

Answer.  The  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF)  supports  basic  subsea  research 
to  understand  fundamental  earth  processes,  including  those  that  generate  earth-
quakes  with  tsunami  potential.  The  Ocean  Observatory  Initiative  (OOI)  will  add  to 
understanding  and  monitoring  of  large  submarine  fault  zones.  Sites  constructed 
through  the  OOI  will  contribute  to  the  seismometer  arrays  of  the  Ocean  Seismic 
Network  (OSN),  as  well  as  provide  other  research  tools  such  as  undersea  pressure 
sensors. Both these efforts will enable the research and technological advancements 
that will enhance the warning system for earthquakes and tsunamis. 

NSF  is  committed  to  cooperation  and  coordination  between  all  environmental  ob-
serving networks, including those that are part of the tsunami warning system. Pro-
gram  managers  from  each  of  the  NSF  observing  systems  and  geophysical  facilities 
(e.g.,  EarthScope,  OOI,  Incorporated  Research  Institutions  for  Seismology—IRIS, 
Network  for  Earthquake  Engineering  Simulation  Research  (NEES),  and  UNAVCO) 
promote  interactions  and  synergies  between  the  observing  systems  and  work  to-
gether  to  respond  to  common  needs  for  measurement  tools,  data  management  and 
cyberinfrastructure,  as  well  as  to  develop  novel  approaches  to  interactions  across 
disciplines.  For  example,  studies  by  the  Integrated  Ocean  Drilling  Program  (IODP) 
drill ship Joides Resolution include instrumented subsea boreholes linked to seafloor 
observatory  networks.  These  are  similar  to  those  proposed  for  the  OOI  and  provide 
excellent prototype information for the future OOI system.

Further coordination and cooperation between the OOI and other seismic research 
projects within the Foundation and other agencies also occurs through shared facil-
ity support as well as use of common data management systems such as that funded 
by  NSF  through  the  IRIS  consortium.  Program  officers  for  the  NSF,  USGS,  NASA, 
and NOAA work together to coordinate scientific projects and share support for geo-
physical facilities. This ensures the full capacity and cost effective use of these facili-
ties.

Question 2. Could you please detail how you anticipate OOI, and particularly the 
NEPTUNE  project,  could  contribute  to  the  science  that  will  lead  to  a  better  under-
standing of tsunami? 

Answer.  The  Regional  Cabled  Observatory  (NEPTUNE)  that  is  part  of  NSF’s 
Ocean  Observatories  Initiative  will  be  constructed  off  the  Washington  and  Oregon 
coasts. This ocean observing network will be equipped with an array of seismic and 
acoustic sensors that will provide data that will complement the Deep-ocean Assess-
ment  and  Reporting  of  Tsunamis  (DART)  buoy  array  for  effective  warning  of  tsu-
nami generation and will also enable researchers to investigate processes leading to 
creation  of  large  tsunamis.  Information  collected  by  NEPTUNE  will  flow  instantly 
to  shore  where  it  will  be  relayed  via  the  Internet  to  the  Tsunami  Warning  Center, 
researchers, educational institutions, science centers and the public. 

The  oceanic  region  off  the  coasts  of  Washington  and  Oregon  is  an  ideal  location 
to  create  an  undersea  laboratory  to  investigate  the  processes  leading  to  tsunami 
generation. This area is home to a variety of active environments each of which will 
be instrumented with seismic and pressure sensors. This will enable researchers to 
better  understand  how  differences  in  tectonic  regimes  can  lead  to  variations  in  the 
amplitude  and  direction  of  tsunamis.  In  addition,  this  region  has  areas  of  gas  hy-
drate  generation  that  will  be  instrumented  and  their  evolution  studied  as  part  of 
the  NEPTUNE  array.  Therefore,  the  effects  of  gas  hydrate  release  on  submarine 
slides  and  their  influence  on  tsunami  generation  can  be  studied  in  detail.  Another 
significant  benefit  will  be  the  ability  to  investigate  all  of  the  processes  leading  to 
tsunami  generation  in  one  location  at  the  scales  at  which  these  processes  occur  so 
that the outcomes of these combined influences can be quantified.

Question 3. Senator Stevens requested an estimation of what it would take to es-
tablish  a  comprehensive  tsunami  notification  system.  I  am  very  interested  in  your 
response and ask that you please forward a copy of your answer to Senator Stevens’ 
question. 

Answer. We have attached a discussion of ‘‘Potential Enhancements to the Global 
Seismic Network’’ (GSN). This paper describes NSF’s role in the GSN, a system that 
provides  real-time  information  on  location  and  tsunami  potential  of  great  earth-
quakes,  and  also  suggests  some  improvements  to  the  system  that  could  be  made 
over  the  next  few  years.  NSF  has  supported  acquisition  of  equipment  for  the  GSN, 
and  shares  operation  of  the  GSN  with  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS).  Imme-
diate  notification  of  significant  earthquake  events  is  made  to  the  National  Earth-
quake Information Center (NEIC), operated by the USGS. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARK PRYOR TO

DR. ARDEN L. BEMENT, JR. 

Question  1.  Without  the  use  of/installation  of  voice  sirens  as  part  of  a  prepared-
ness plan, how do you warn people on the ground? Are there other effective warning 
systems available for this purpose? What criteria are used to determine which warn-
ing system is reliable in case of tsunami? 

Question 1a. Should a preparedness plan include a warning mechanism for small 
fishing  boats  trawling  near  the  coastline?  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Ad-
ministration  (NOAA)  weather  radios  can  be  used  to  inform  these  fishing  boats  at 
minimal cost (approximately $20). 

Answer. We have attached a discussion of ‘‘Potential Enhancements to the Global 
Seismic Network’’(GSN). This paper describes NSF’s role in the GSN, a system that 
provides  real-time  information  on  location  and  tsunami  potential  of  great  earth-
quakes. NSF has supported acquisition of equipment for the GSN, and shares oper-
ation  of  the  GSN  with  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS).  Immediate  notification 
of  significant  earthquake  events  is  made  to  the  National  Earthquake  Information 
Center  (NEIC),  operated  by  the  USGS.  Although  NSF  participates  in  the  inter-
agency  National  Earthquake  Hazard  Reduction  Program  (NEHRP),  agencies  other 
than NSF have primary responsibility for issuing public disaster warnings and NSF 
defers to them to provide detailed responses concerning warning mechanisms.

RESPONSE TO LETTER DATED FEBRUARY 7, 2005 FROM CHAIRMAN STEVENS AND

CO-CHAIRMAN INOUYE TO U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY 

111

In  response  to  a  letter,  dated  February  7,  2005  from  Chairman  Ted  Stevens  and 

Co-Chairman Daniel K. Inouye: 
Explain  what  information  or  resources  your  agency  requires  before  it  can 

issue a public warning notification of a natural hazard or disaster. 

The  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS)  has  responsibility  under  the  Stafford  Act  to 
issue  forecasts  and  warnings  for  earthquakes,  volcanoes,  and  landslides.  For 
tsunamis,  wildfire,  flood  and  hurricane  hazards,  USGS  provides  critical  support  to 
the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  and  other  agencies 
tasked with warning responsibility. In order to carry out these mandates, USGS re-
quires a monitoring infrastructure that includes local, national and global networks; 
reliable  and  redundant  telecommunications;  modem  computing  centers  for  data 
analysis  and  dissemination;  and  a  skilled  staff  of  analysts,  technicians,  scientists, 
and  network  support  people.  To  ensure  that  publicly  funded  monitoring  networks 
and education programs are targeted to regions at highest risk, USGS performs as-
sessments of the distribution and extent of each natural hazard listed above at var-
ious scales—from national to, in high-hazard urban areas, local. To improve the ac-
curacy  and  timeliness  of  warnings  and  to  minimize  false  alarms,  we  perform  (and 
fund university and State partners to perform) targeted research to understand the 
underlying processes and their predictability. To maximize the extent to which haz-
ard  information  is  received  and  acted  upon  by  appropriate  individuals  when  disas-
ters  strike,  we  actively  pursue  and  foster  links  with  local  governments,  emergency 
management agencies and the media. The USGS targets these capabilities to areas 
with the highest hazard and the greatest risk. 
Volcanoes 

Impending  volcanic  eruptions  can  be  forecast  and  warnings  issued  in  time  for 
communities  to  take  preparatory  actions.  Eruption  forecasts  and  warnings  depend 
on  telemetered,  real-time  data  streams  from  diverse  suites  of  monitoring  instru-
ments  on  volcanoes,  including  reliable  data  streams  transmitted  by  other  agencies 
(e.g.,  GOES  satellite  data  from  NOAA,  seismic  data  from  key  university  coopera-
tors).  Observatory-based  scientists  are  necessary  to  interpret  monitoring  data,  as 
eruptions  are  too  complex  for  the  fully  automatic  generation  of  alerts  directly  from 
machine  signals.  Automatic  warnings  of  large  volcanic  debris  flows  (lahars)  based 
on  signals  from  acoustic-flow-monitor  arrays  may  be  the  exception.  These  capabili-
ties  are  currently  deployed  at  the  highest-priority  volcanoes.  The  USGS  has  closely 
monitored  the  eruption  of  Mount  St.  Helens  since  September  2004,  correctly  fore-
casting the style of eruption, and remaining in daily communication with the Wash-
ington  State  Emergency  Management  Division  and  the  U.S.  Forest  Service  (USFS) 
who  rely  on  USGS  information  to  restrict  public  access  to  potentially  threatened 
areas surrounding the volcano. 
Landslides 

Landslides, whether induced by rainfall or earthquakes, involve complicated phys-
ical processes that are not sufficiently well understood to permit reliable predictions, 
but  the  capability  to  provide  advanced  warning  of  increased  landslide  danger  now 
exists.  Doing  so  requires  accurate  landslide  thresholds  to  monitor  the  hazard  and 
travel  distances  to  gauge  possible  impact.  The  first  step  is  a  detailed  study  of  sus-
ceptible  geographic  regions  having  the  requisite  geology  and  topography.  Probable 
landslide paths and travel distances are analyzed to identify possible landslide haz-
ards,  for  example,  by  specifying  areas  where  landslides  have  a  high  probability  of 
impacting  roads  and  buildings.  Within  different  regions,  the  timing  of  landslides 
needs  to  be  observed  during  storms  and  correlated  with  the  rainfall  intensity  and 
duration  in  order  to  develop  the  criteria  of  rainfall  thresholds  for  triggering  land-
slides.  Advanced  weather  forecasts  can  be  combined  with  the  threshold  models  to 
evaluate  whether  landslides  are  likely  to  occur  within  regions  susceptible  to 
landsliding.  Real-time  monitoring  of  rainfall  and  site  measurements  of  rising 
groundwater and initial slope movements near landslide sources can provide critical 
information  for  issuing  immediate  public  warning  of  landslide  hazards.  Numerous 
rainstorms  in  southern  California  this  winter  have  resulted  in  serious  landslides 
and  debris  flows.  USGS  scientists  have  issued  advisories  of  potential  landslides  to 
the National Weather Service, California Office of Emergency Services (OES), other 
state  and  federal  agencies,  and  the  public—as  recently  as  February  15,  2005.  The 
San Bernardino County Sun and other local newspapers have used these advisories 
in  crafting  news  articles  alerting  their  readers  to  the  possibility  of  landslide  occur-
rence and instructing their readers on ways to protect themselves.

112

The  USGS  and  NOAA  recently  signed  an  MOA  to  develop  a  joint  watch/warning 
system  for  rainfall-generated  landslides  (debris  flows).  The  MOA  calls  for  NOAA-
generated  precipitation  observations  and  forecasts  to  be  forwarded  to  the  USGS, 
where  they  will  be  compared  with  the  threshold  models.  When  a  watch/warning  is 
warranted,  the  USGS  will  forward  the  pertinent  information  to  NOAA  for  NOAA 
to  disseminate  a  joint  message  using  its  standard  watch/warning  communication 
procedures.  The  prototype  of  this  system  will  be  fielded  by  September  2005  in  the 
area  of  operation  of  NOAA’s  Weather  Forecasting  Offices  of  Oxnard  (CA)  and  San 
Diego (CA), and will cover a number of counties, including San Bernardino and Ven-
tura counties. 
Earthquakes 

For  earthquakes,  it  is  not  yet  possible  to  predict  the  time  and  location  of  dam-
aging events, but it is possible to predict their impacts and deliver rapid post-event 
information  to  emergency  responders.  First,  USGS  delivers  long-term  forecasts  of 
earthquake  shaking  in  the  form  of  hazard  maps  that  underlie  most  building  codes 
used  in  the  United  States.  Second,  within  minutes  after  a  domestic  earthquake, 
USGS and its regional network partners issue an alert with location and magnitude. 
In five urban areas where dense arrays of strong-motion instruments have been de-
ployed through the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS), Internet-distributed 
ShakeMaps  showing  the  intensity  of  ground  shaking  are  available  to  prioritize  re-
sponse  efforts.  Following  the  December  22,  2003,  magnitude  6.5  San  Simeon  earth-
quake,  the  California  OES  was  automatically  notified  within  five  minutes,  and  the 
first  ShakeMap  was  pushed  to  OES  and  other  users  in  less  than  nine  minutes. 
Third,  in  the  time  scale  of  hours  to  days  following  large  earthquakes,  USGS  pro-
vides short-term predictions for the likelihood of aftershocks in California. 
Which  entities  or  organizations  receive  warnings  from,  or  through,  your 
agency  (such  as  federal  and  local  disaster  response  entities,  first
responders/911, and local and national media outlets). 

Earthquakes 

The USGS provides hazard alerts to a broad suite of federal, state and local gov-
ernment agencies, and private-sector entities, including the media. The scope of the 
USGS notification process depends on the severity, extent, location, and possible im-
pact  of  the  hazard  at  hand.  For  damaging  domestic  earthquakes,  USGS  notifies  by 
telephone, fax, e-mail and/or pager:

White House, The Situation Room 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 
Department of the Interior (DOI) Watch office 
Dam  and  power  plant  operators  (including  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers 
(USACE,  Bureau  of  Reclamation,  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  and  some 
public and private utilities) 
Pipeline operators 
Railroads 
Insurance companies 
Department of Defense (DoD) offices with domestic civil defense responsibilities 
State and local offices of emergency services 
State geological surveys 
Veterans Administration 
Department of Agriculture 
Department  of  Transportation  including  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration 
(FAA) 
Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  Transportation  Security  Administra-
tion 
NOAA 
The Weather Channel 
National Science Foundation (NSF) 
National Institute of Standards and Technology

For  both  domestic  and  international  damaging  earthquakes,  USGS  also  e-mails 
earthquake notifications to over 40,000 subscribers including many print and broad-
cast media companies. For public and news media, notices are automatically posted 
to the Web. In the first few days after the Sumatra disaster, USGS earthquake Web 
sites  received  over  120  million  hits.  The  ANSS  regional  networks  also  have  e-mail/
pager notification lists that reach further into affected States and communities. De-
pending  on  the  location  and  severity  of  the  earthquake,  targeted  distribution  also 
proceeds to key users that can include the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices,  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  NOAA  Pacific  and  Alaska/West  Coast

Tsunami  Warning  Centers,  state  and  local  emergency  managers,  and  200  foreign 
agencies. 

For  damaging  international  earthquakes,  USGS  notifies  by  telephone,  fax,  e-mail 

and/or pager:

White House, The Situation Room 
Department of State 
U.S. Embassies and consulates in affected countries 
U.S. Agency for International Development 
United Nations Office of Coordinator of Humanitarian Affairs 
Department of Defense 
Federal Aviation Administration 
Federal Emergency Management Agency 
Earthquake Engineering Research Institute 
Humanitarian groups (Red Cross, Red Crescent) 
International Atomic Energy Commission 
Private sector and government search-and-rescue groups

Volcanoes 

For volcanic alerts, each of the five U.S. volcano observatories has developed com-
munication protocols tailored to the appropriate hazard and region. For notifications 
of  explosive  eruptions  that  can  send  volcanic  particles  (‘‘ash’’)  into  the  atmosphere, 
USGS eruption alerts are sent to

FAA air traffic control centers 
NOAA  meteorological  watch  offices  and  Volcanic  Ash  Advisory  Centers  Air 
Force Weather Agency 
U.S. Coast Guard 
Military bases 
Airports

For  volcanic  ground  hazards  (such  as  lava  flows  and  debris  flows),  USGS  relies 
on  the  interagency  incident  command  system  (ICS),  operated  either  by  state  emer-
gency or federal land managers (like the one established by the U.S. Forest Service 
in 2004 for the eruption of Mt. St. Helens). In the absence of an operating ICS, the 
protocol for ground hazards is to alert State emergency and land managers (e.g., Na-
tional  Park  Service,  U.S.  Forest  Service,  and  Washington  Emergency  Management 
Department), who in turn alert county emergency managers and other federal agen-
cies. When an eruption is expected or underway, USGS also makes ash fall forecast 
graphics  and  sends  them  to  appropriate  FEMA  regional  offices  and  may  have  a 
FEMA representative on-site at an observatory. To communicate with the local and 
national media—before, during, and after an eruption or episode of unrest—each ob-
servatory commits experienced staff to talk directly with media representatives. 
Landslides 

Landslide  advisories  and  warnings  are  sent  to  the  appropriate  State  Offices  of 
Emergency Management and the National Weather Service. Notice is also provided 
(through  the  DOI  Watch  Office)  to  the  White  House,  DOI  land  management  agen-
cies,  DHS  (including  FEMA),  and  Military  Commands.  To  communicate  with  local 
and  national  media  prior  to,  during,  and  after  landslide  events,  Landslide  Hazard 
Program  scientists  are  available  to  respond  to  media  inquiries.  The  Landslide  Haz-
ard  Program  also  posts  detailed  information  and  maps  on  its  Web  site,  which  is 
available to the media, public officials, and the public. 
Demonstrate  which  communications  technologies  are  currently  used  to
deliver  these  public  warnings,  such  as  automatic  alert  TVs  and  radios, 
telephones,  digital  assistants  (PDAs),  and  the  Internet.  If  such
communications  technologies  are  not  being  used,  we  would  like  to 
know  what  the  impediments  are,  and  the  status  of  any  discussions  to 
expand the warning system’s capability to do so. 

The  USGS  uses  a  broad  range  of  technologies  to  distribute  alerts  and  notifica-
tions,  including  the  public  Internet,  private/government  Internet,  text  messaging, 
pager,  phone,  fax,  NOAA  Weather  Wire,  and  briefings  to  local  and  national  media. 
Currently, over 40,000 e-mails will be sent following a large earthquake. Users have 
the choice of a full message by e-mail or a shorter message suitable for a cell phone 
or  PDA.  Several  improved  distribution  programs  are  in  development  under  the 
ANSS,  including  a  replacement  for  the  current  e-mail  notification  system  that  will 
allow  users  to  customize  which  earthquake  sizes  and  locations  will  generate  alerts. 
In  the  Pacific  Northwest,  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program—a 
partnership that includes NOAA, FEMA, NSF, USGS and five Pacific States—is de-

ploying  all-hazards  warning  system  technology  to  coastal  communities  in  that  re-
gion,  providing  tsunami,  earthquake  and  mudflow  warnings.  The  pole-mounted  All 
Hazard Alert Broadcast system has a blue warning light to cut through fog, a siren 
warning, and a voice warning that is keyed by NOAA Weather Radio or local emer-
gency  managers.  Washington  Emergency  Management  is  developing  this  warning 
system as part of the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program. This Program 
is  a  model  for  how  federal  agencies  and  their  State  partners  can  work  together  to 
reduce risk. 

The  USGS  relies  on  FAA  and  NOAA  communications  systems  to  relay  notifica-
tions  of  volcanic  activity  to  enroute  aircraft  and  airline  dispatchers.  For  other 
groups,  USGS  primarily  uses  brief  phone  calls,  followed  by  fax  and  e-mail,  to  pro-
vide  more  detailed  information.  During  both  the  premonitory  and  eruptive  phases 
of  a  volcanic  crisis,  PDAs  and  text  messaging  are  used  to  notify  off-duty  scientists 
automatically of changes in monitoring parameters. 
Specify  a  process  by  which  your  agency,  either  on  its  own,  or  in
conjunction  with  other  relevant  agencies,  can  maximize  effective  dis-
semination of public warning notifications. 

The USGS hazard/disaster notification process relies on a ‘‘notification tree’’ or in-
frastructure,  in  which  federal  and  state  agencies  alerted  by  USGS  take  responsi-
bility  for  disseminating  USGS  information  to  emergency  responders  and  other  crit-
ical  users.  This  system  contributes  to  an  all-hazards  approach  to  public  warning. 
This  process  is  supplemented  regionally  and  locally  by  direct  (and  in  many  cases 
automated)  alerting  to  critical  users  (e.g.,  earthquake  ShakeMap  delivery  to  utili-
ties, state transportation departments, homeland security command centers, and re-
gional pager/text-messaging to emergency managers). We believe this is an effective 
strategy  for  USGS,  and  it  is  appropriate  to  our  mission.  The  USGS  is  continually 
honing its disaster response strategy. 

As  part  of  the  President’s  plan  for  an  improved  tsunami  warning  system,  USGS 
proposes to deploy software developed by the California Integrated Seismic Network 
(a  USGS,  university  and  State  partnership)  to  speed  USGS-generated  earthquake 
information directly to local emergency managers with a dual use capability to also 
provide NOAA tsunami warnings. 

Tsunamis  are  not  solely  produced  by  earthquakes.  Approximately  five  percent  of 
tsunamis  in  the  past  250  years  were  produced  by  volcanoes,  and  some  of  these  are 
among  the  most  destructive  tsunami  events  known.  Volcano  induced  tsunamis  are 
generated in various ways; the largest, most destructive tsunamis have been caused 
by  large  explosive  eruptions  and  flank  collapse  events  on  island  and  coastal  volca-
noes.  There  is  a  demonstrated  volcanic  tsunami  hazard  in  Alaska  and  Hawaii  and 
a  likely  one  in  the  Commonwealth  of  the  Northern  Mariana  Islands.  Improved  vol-
cano  monitoring  systems  and  response  planning  at  volcanoes  that  have  a  potential 
tsunami  hazard  would  help  provide  better  mitigation  concerning  an  important  nat-
ural hazard. 

The USGS will continue its broad-based public awareness activities, which are in-
tegral to effective use of warnings and other hazards information by the public and 
civil  defense  authorities.  For  example,  USGS  is  working  with  the  FAA,  NOAA  and 
others, to formulate a National Interagency Operational Plan for Volcanic Ash Epi-
sodes, and we continue to develop other inter-agency response plans for ground haz-
ards.  Such  a  plan  is  necessary  for  USGS  to  meet  the  aviation  sector’s  stated  need 
for notification of explosive ash-producing eruptions by a volcano observatory to the 
appropriate FAA air-traffic control center within 5 minutes of the event. The USGS 
offices in California and Washington provide training programs for local emergency 
managers  and  media  on  how  to  use  ShakeMap  and  other  earthquake  notification 
and  assessment  products  generated  by  the  regional  and  national  networks.  The 
USGS  is  working  with  the  American  Planning  Association  to  develop  a  best-prac-
tices manual on landslides that will become available to thousands of planners this 
spring. 

The USGS is working with the National Weather Service to develop a protocol for 
issuing  landslide  warnings  over  NOAA  Weather  Radio  All  Hazards  network.  State 
and county emergency managers—the agencies most responsible for issuing instruc-
tions  to  citizens—rely  on  this  communication  network  for  timely  warnings.  Part  of 
the protocol will allow real-time transmittal of current weather conditions to USGS 
landslide experts to better pinpoint the areas of greatest danger. 

For improved delivery of flood warnings, USGS currently partners with other fed-
eral  agencies,  including  the  National  Weather  Service,  Army  Corps  of  Engineers, 
and  Bureau  of  Reclamation.  This  includes  efforts  to  raise  public  awareness  about 
appropriate responses to flood watches and warnings. In addition, there are a num-
ber of proof-of-concept experiments underway to improve the timeliness and quality

of  USGS  information  used  by  public  and  private  entities  to  reduce  flood  damages 
and loss of life. 

To aid wildland fire suppression, USGS manages and hosts the Geospatial Multi-
Agency  Coordination  Group  or  GeoMAC,  an  Internet-based  tool  that  permits  fire 
managers  to  access  online  maps  of  current  fire  locations  and  perimeters  in  the 
conterminous  48  States  and  Alaska  using  a  standard  Web  browser.  GeoMAC  is  a 
multi-agency group with technical and subject matter experts from the Department 
of  the  Interior’s  fire  management  agencies—the  Bureau  of  Land  Management,  Na-
tional  Park  Service,  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service,  and  the  Bureau  of  Indian  Af-
fairs, and the United States Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture, as well 
as numerous other agencies and firms. 

The USGS is working with the National Interagency Fire Center and the Univer-
sity of Alaska Fairbanks, specifically the Geographic Information Network of Alaska 
(GINA)  to  develop  a  process  for  analyzing  satellite  information  to  obtain  daily  up-
dates  of  vegetation  condition  for  Alaska  to  improve  the  sensitivity  to  fire  weather 
conditions.  A  cooperative  project  called  LANDFIRE  is  conducted  by  USGS  and  the 
Forest Service to provide regional and local scale geospatial data of vegetation, fuel, 
and  fire  regime.  The  project  will  enhance  prediction  of  fire  danger  and  under-
standing of fire behavior for incident commanders and a broad range of other users. 
Specify  how  your  agency  interacts  with  the  Department  of  Homeland
Security  (including  FEMA),  the  Federal  Communications  Commission, 
the  Department  of  Commerce,  or  other  relevant  agencies  with  respect 
to warning systems. 

The  USGS  interacts  with  DHS,  Department  of  Commerce,  DoD  and  many  other 
Federal agencies on matters related to hazard mitigation, preparedness and disaster 
alerting.  Key  among  these  are  FEMA,  National  Weather  Service  and,  for  volcanic 
hazards,  FAA.  Notifications  are  either  direct  to  the  responding  agency  or  coordi-
nated  through  the  Department  of  the  Interior  Watch  Office,  which  operates  around 
the  clock  to  compile  and  disseminate  information  relevant  to  law  enforcement, 
homeland  security,  and  natural  disasters  impacting  the  Department’s  responsibil-
ities  across  the  United  States.  For  earthquakes,  USGS  National  Earthquake  Infor-
mation Center has a direct phone line to the DHS/FEMA operations center in Wash-
ington. The USGS and FEMA are partners in the National Earthquake Hazards Re-
duction Program and have developed and tested a coordinated earthquake response 
plan.  For  tsunami  coordination,  USGS  exchanges  telephone,  e-mail,  data,  and  Web 
products  with  the  NOAA  Tsunami  Warning  Centers  (and  with  tsunami  warning 
centers  in  Japan,  Chile  and  Russia).  The  USGS  also  provides  earthquake  alerting 
through the NOAA Weather Wire, as previously noted. 

For volcanic hazards, USGS works with FAA, NOAA, and DoD to disseminate no-
tifications  of  explosive  eruptions  and  associated  ash  clouds  to  the  aviation  sector 
(both  military  and  commercial).  For  ground  volcanic  hazards,  USGS  relies  on  the 
interagency Incident Command System (ICS), operated either by state emergency or 
federal  land  managers  (like  the  one  established  by  USFS  in  2004  for  the  eruption 
of Mt. St. Helens). In the absence of an operating ICS, the protocol for ground haz-
ards is to alert state emergency and land managers (e.g., NPS, USFS), who in turn 
alert  county  emergency  managers  and  other  federal  agencies.  The  USGS  sends  ash 
fall forecast graphics to appropriate FEMA regional offices. 

To improve the effectiveness of flood warnings, USGS collaborates with many fed-
eral,  state  and  local  government  agencies  and  the  private  sector.  The  FEMA,  and 
state and local officials monitor flood watches and warnings and use USGS Internet 
sites  to  ascertain  flood  conditions  for  those  rivers  not  serviced  by  the  National 
Weather Service river forecast system. 
Explain  how  your  agency  could  improve  public  notification  of  impending 

natural hazards and disasters. 

The  USGS  could  improve  public  hazard  notification  and  warning  of  natural  haz-
ards in three basic areas: (1) Modernization and expansion of monitoring networks; 
(2)  increased  robustness  and  redundancy  of  communication  links;  and,  (3)  acceler-
ated development and deployment of capabilities to take full advantage of new data 
streams, research findings and communication technologies to improve the accuracy 
and timeliness of information we provide for emergency management. 
(1) Modernization and expansion of monitoring networks 

The  President’s  proposal  for  improving  tsunami  warning  systems  would  replace 
legacy  hardware  and  software  systems  at  the  USGS  National  Earthquake  Informa-
tion  Center  (NEIC)  and  establish  24×7  operations,  actions  that  will  improve  re-
sponse time, benefiting both earthquake notification and tsunami warning. The pro-
posal  also  includes  support  to  improve  station  up-time  in  the  Global  Seismographic

Network  (GSN)—a  partnership  of  USGS,  the  National  Science  Foundation,  the  In-
corporated  Research  Institutions  for  Seismology,  and  the  University  of  California—
and to install additional stations in the Caribbean region. The NEIC modernization 
is a key component of the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS). As described 
in USGS Circular 1188, the ANSS plan includes both notification and early warning 
of earthquakes as fundamental goals. 

Impending  volcanic  eruptions  can  be  forecast  and  warnings  issued  in  time  for 
communities to take preparatory actions. To improve this warning capability, USGS 
is  developing  a  plan  for  a  National  Volcano  Early  Warning  System  (NVEWS).  This 
plan  will  outline  priorities  for  monitoring  instrumentation  at  our  most  threatening 
volcanoes,  along  with  development  of  a  new  generation  of  information  technology 
tools for sharing of data. 

Fire  danger  information  and  specific  information  on  fire  fuels  assessment  depend 
on reliable timely satellite observations. It is important that USGS continue to pro-
vide remote sensing technology to the fire management agencies. It is, therefore, im-
portant to support the ongoing development of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission 
(LDCM) and the companion National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Sat-
ellite  System  (NPOESS),  a  satellite  system  used  to  monitor  global  environmental 
conditions,  and  collect  and  disseminate  data  related  to:  weather,  atmosphere, 
oceans, land and near-space environment. 
(2) Robust telemetry and communication links 

For  rapid-onset  events  like  earthquakes,  tsunamis,  volcanic  eruptions  and  land-
slides,  only  realtime  systems  can  provide  data  in  sufficient  time  to  issue  actionable 
notifications  and  warnings.  The  funding  in  the  Emergency  Supplemental  for  im-
proved tsunami detection and warning system for the United States, along with the 
funding  in  the  2006  budget  for  the  same  purpose,  will  expand  and  improve  telem-
etry  connections  to  monitoring  stations,  so  that  the  seismic  stations  in  the  Global 
Seismographic  Network  provide  real-time  data.  This  will  contribute  to  decreasing 
the  reporting  time  for  global  earthquakes  from  over  one  hour  to  about  twenty  min-
utes. 

USGS  data  and  products  often  travel  across  a  web  of  communications  links  from 
the  monitoring  network  to  the  public,  typically  involving  satellite  uplinks  and 
downlinks,  the  Internet,  and  radio  or  television  bands.  Although  some  USGS  sys-
tems  employ  redundant  links  (e.g.,  satellite,  phone  lines,  and/or  Internet  commu-
nications),  in  many  cases  the  communications  channels  are  vulnerable  to  a  single 
point  of  failure.  Hardening  of  these  telecommunication  links  is  essential  to  ensure 
a reliable warning system is available with the appropriate level of redundancy. 
As part of the NEIC upgrade, the President’s proposal calls for 24×7 network op-
erations  and  robust  Internet  serving  of  seismic  data.  It  would  also  increase  the 
number  of  USGS-operated  GSN  stations  that  provide  real-time  data  to  NEIC  and 
the  NOAA  tsunami  warning  centers.  Currently,  only  80  percent  of  GSN  stations 
have  digital  telemetry  links  that  allow  for  real-time  communication.  Both  for  the 
GSN  and  the  ANSS,  a  fully  telemetered  system  with  redundant  communications 
links  will  improve  response  time  for  damaging  earthquakes.  For  volcano  hazards, 
establishing  a  local  Internet  portal  in  Alaska  would  strengthen  the  robustness  and 
reliability of warnings. 
(3) New capabilities 

The  USGS  is  testing  dedicated  ground-based  Doppler  radar  at  volcanoes  in  order 
to  improve  its  ability  to  provide  notification  of  explosive  ash-producing  eruption  to 
the appropriate FAA air traffic control center within 5 minutes of the event, a need 
identified  by  the  aviation  sector.  By  adding  such  radar  units  to  the  suite  of  moni-
toring  instruments  in  place  at  restless  or  erupting  volcanoes,  rapid  detection  and 
confirmation  of  eruptive  ash  plumes  at  night  and  in  bad  weather  is  greatly  im-
proved. 

Increased  use  of  new  remote-sensing  technologies  such  as  airborne  LiDAR  and 
satellite-based  InSAR  would  allow  USGS  to  provide  more  accurate  information  for 
a  number  of  hazards.  In  the  case  of  landslides,  LiDAR  delivers  highly  detailed  to-
pography,  which  is  critical  for  landslide  susceptibility  characterization  and  identi-
fication of past landslide scars. InSAR allows monitoring of large slow-moving land-
slides. These technologies have proven valuable for early detection of volcano re-acti-
vation  as  well  as  providing  important  insights  on  earthquake  fault  rupture  charac-
teristics. 

Forecasting coastal hazards associated with hurricanes and other major storms is 
critically-dependent  on  the  availability  of  accurate  and  up-to-date  information  on 
nearshore  and  coastal  elevations.  In  cooperation  with  NASA,  NOAA,  and  the 
USACE,  USGS  is  developing  a  comprehensive  national  assessment  of  coastal  haz-

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  13:59 Nov 17, 2005 Jkt 022845 PO 00000 Frm 00120 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\22845.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

117

ards  based  on  high-resolution  LiDAR  surveys  of  coastal  and  nearshore  elevation. 
Data  developed  within  this  program  have  supported  the  development  of  models  re-
lating  coastal  response  to  storm  surge  and  wave  run-up  and  nearshore,  beach,  and 
dune  elevations.  Forecasts  of  coastal  vulnerability  to  impending  storm  landfall  are 
developed prior to landfall and made available to state and federal agencies to guide 
pre-storm  evacuation  and  post-storm  recovery  planning.  At  present,  forecasts  rely 
on  historic  or  ‘‘model’’  storm  characteristics  and  USGS  and  NOAA  are  working  col-
laboratively  to  develop  vulnerability  products  that  incorporate  hurricane  forecasts 
issued by the National Hurricane Center. 

The  USGS  routinely  acquires  and  distributes  global  satellite  image  data  from  its 
Landsat  satellite  system;  receives  and  distributes  data  from  several  NASA  earth-
observing  satellites;  and  obtains  and  redistributes  data  from  U.S.  commercial  and 
international  satellite  systems.  In  support  of  tsunami  disaster-response,  USGS  is 
distributing  many  types  of  tsunami-related  satellite  imagery,  maps,  and  other 
geospatial data and working with commercial satellite data providers to support the 
needs of Federal Government agencies. For disaster situations such as these, where 
hundreds  of  thousands  of  digital  files  have  already  been  distributed,  USGS  posts 
digital  data  on  a  server  and  users  electronically  ‘‘pull’’  what  they  need  over  the 
Internet. The President’s budget request for USGS includes funds to ensure the con-
tinued  operation  of  Landsat  7,  along  with  NASA  and  NOAA,  and  to  begin  work  on 
an  upgraded  ground-processing  system  to  acquire,  process,  archive  and  distribute 
data  from  a  new  generation  of  satellite-based  land  image  sensors.  This  Landsat 
Data Continuity Mission is expected to begin operations in 2009. 

The  President’s  proposal  for  upgrading  NEIC  will  accelerate  development  of  sev-
eral  rapid-response  products,  including  the  Prompt  Assessment  of  Global  Earth-
quakes  for  Response  (PAGER)  system,  which  uses  information  about  an  earth-
quake’s  source,  combined  with  information  regarding  population  and  infrastructure 
in the affected region to estimate potential damage and loss of life in a major earth-
quake. The PAGER system is ideal for both domestic and international areas where 
a  dense  seismic  network  is  not  available,  but  where  a  rapid  assessment  is  critical 
for estimating impact. 

In  several  metropolitan  areas,  the  ANSS  ShakeMap  System  supports  direct  links 
to  critical  users.  In  California  for  example,  ShakeMap  is  automatically  sent  by 
Internet to:

California Department of Transportation (DOT) 
California Office of Emergency Services (OES) 
Utilities  (Southern  California  Edison,  Pacific  Gas  &  Electric,  Southern  Cali-
fornia Gas, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, East Bay Munic-
ipal Utility District) 
Bay Area Rapid Transit system 
National media outlets 
Communications companies 
California Earthquake Authority 
Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Services 
Local media outlets 
FEMA regional offices

Outside of California, ShakeMap is in various stages of development and integra-
tion.  ShakeMap  requires  dense  instrumentation.  ShakeMap  has  been  deployed  in 
Salt  Lake  City,  Utah,  Anchorage,  Alaska,  and  Seattle,  Washington.  In  those  cities, 
ShakeMap has been integrated into their emergency management and response pro-
cedures.  The  ShakeCast  software,  now  under  development  at  a  pilot  level,  is  de-
signed  to  help  users  overcome  Internet  security  barriers  and  effectively  integrate 
USGS earthquake notifications into emergency procedures. 

The USGS is exploring the feasibility of earthquake early warning, in which rapid 
computer analysis and communication links are used to provide seconds of warning 
before earthquake waves arrive. Such warning systems are in place in Japan, Mex-
ico and Taiwan. The 2000 re-authorization of the National Earthquake Hazards Re-
duction  Program  (NEHRP)  called  for  development  of  a  U.S.  early  warning  system 
for earthquakes. The USGS currently sponsors modest research and development in 
this  area,  including  research  on  earthquake  early  warning  feasibility  and  efforts  to 
improve  the  numbers  of  seismic  stations  reporting  in  real  time  and  the  speed  and 
reliability of earthquake reporting. 

Building on current capabilities for issuing aftershock probabilities, USGS and its 
partners  in  the  California  Integrated  Seismic  Network  will  be  releasing  a  public 
Web  site  this  spring  with  the  probability  of  strong  earthquake  shaking  in  the  next 
24  hours,  based  upon  a  background  probability  from  our  understanding  of  geology, 
modified  by  the  probability  that  earthquakes  that  have  just  occurred  will  trigger

other activity. In southern California, USGS is investigating what information from 
structural  instrumentation  can  be  used  to  provide  rapid  estimates  of  structural 
damage  following  earthquakes  or  explosions.  An  experimental  instrumentation 
package  is  being  installed  in  two  buildings  in  the  Los  Angeles  area  and  we  are  de-
veloping  tools  to  analyze  the  structural  health  of  the  buildings  from  those  data 
streams. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO

ROGER A. HANSEN 

Question.  Dr.  Hansen,  thank  you  for  your  work  to  improve  local  communication 
systems for tsunami warnings in Alaska. Because of his strong interest in protecting 
coastal communities, Senator Stevens requested a written suggestion of what a pilot 
project for improving and expanding local tsunami warning systems would look like 
in  your  estimation.  Because  of  Washington  State’s  high  risk  for  a  tsunami  disaster 
in  the  next  50  years,  I’m  very  interested  in  your  vision  of  a  possible  pilot  project 
and request that you please also send me your suggestions.

Answer. 

PILOT PROJECT FOR IMPROVING TSUNAMI SAFETY IN ALASKA 

The Problem 

The  December  26,  2004  Sumatra  Earthquake  and  Tsunami  illustrated  a  funda-
mental  failure:  The  inability  to  communicate  a  warning  message  to  remote  areas. 
This failure existed (both nationally and internationally) at all levels of observation, 
information dissemination, and local education and outreach.

• Lack  of  warning  system  contributed  to  deaths  of  10s  or  100s  of  thousands  of 

people.

• All links in chain missing. 

Scientists—National Authorities—Local Authorities—Populace

A Secondary failure (scientific) comes from the inability to obtain a rapid and ro-

bust estimate of an earthquake magnitude using current instrumentation.

• The  Magnitude  of  the  earthquake  was  dramatically  underestimated  in  real 

time.

• But  we  can  do  something  about  it.  The  combination  of  strong  motion  seismic 
stations  and  GPS  data  in  the  near  regional  area  of  a  large  earthquake  can  be 
shown  to  estimate  magnitude  rapidly  within  0.1–0.2  magnitude  units  of  the 
final estimate.

Forty years earlier on March 27, 1964 a magnitude 9.2 earthquake ripped through 
the  Prince  William  Sound  in  southern  Alaska,  generating  a  devastating  tsunami. 
Though the death toll in the 1964 Good Friday quake is miniscule compared to the 
Indian  Ocean  disaster,  Alaska  today  is  vastly  different  but  still  faces  difficult  chal-
lenges  with  warning  its  at-risk  communities  of  the  occurrence  of  tsunamis.  These 
challenges come in part from the nature of our remote location, irregular coastlines 
with complex bathymetry and topography; the vast size of the state that we live in, 
one  of  the  most  seismically  active  regions  of  the  world;  the  lack  of  infrastructure 
throughout  the  area  for  both  operations  and  maintenance  of  monitoring  systems; 
and consistent and timely communication of warning messages. 
The Solution 

As  presented  in  my  testimony  to  the  Senate  Committee  on  Commerce,  Science, 
and  Transportation,  I  will  concentrate  on  addressing  some  of  the  needs  for  improv-
ing  tsunami  safety  in  Alaska  by  focusing  this  pilot  project  on  combining  warning 
guidance,  hazard  assessment,  and  mitigation  in  the  very  seismically  active  Alaska 
Peninsula and Aleutian Islands region. 

The  pilot  project  area  has  been  recognized  as  the  most  seismically  active  area  in 
the  United  States.  The  area  generates  large  tsunamis  that  can  affect  not  only  the 
coastlines of Alaska, but also the rest of the Pacific Ocean. The goals of this project 
will  be  accomplished  by  engaging  the  partnerships  that  already  exist  in  Alaska  for 
addressing tsunami safety. This team of professionals from the University of Alaska, 
and  state  and  federal  agencies  are  already  operating  as  a  partnership  within  the 
Tsunami  Warning  and  Environmental  Observatory  for  Alaska  (TWEAK)  program 
coordinated out of the University of Alaska.

Warning Guidance 

119

The  region  of  Southern  Alaska  extending  into  the  Aleutian  Islands  is  severely 
lacking  in  modern  earthquake  instrumentation  even  though  there  have  been  more 
large  earthquakes  in  the  past  50  years  than  anywhere  else  in  the  United  States. 
First  and  foremost,  we  must  be  able  to  detect  events  that  can  trigger  tsunamis. 
The  primary  method  of  event  detection  is  accomplished  using  seismology  and  seis-
mic networks. Sea level data (both tide gauges and deep ocean buoys) are also mon-
itored to verify the existence of and danger posed by tsunamis. Our primary hazard 
(like  that  in  Sumatra)  comes  from  a  ‘‘local’’  tsunami  generated  by  nearby  large 
earthquakes  in  or  near  the  coast  of  Alaska.  Therefore,  we  must  rely  on  the  rapid 
warnings that can be issued from the detection of large earthquakes by the seismic 
network. 

Modern seismic recordings combined with GPS data can provide rapid information 
on earthquake location, size, and distribution of sea floor deformation that generates 
tsunamis. However, since much of the seismic network in Alaska has been in oper-
ation since the late 1960s, many stations are in need of modernization. 

Over the past few years, AEIC was tasked through the National Tsunami Hazard 
Mitigation Program (NTHMP) to develop 18 of these modern stations for Alaska and 
to  ensure  timely  delivery  of  this  data  to  the  warning  centers.  The  University  pro-
gram  has  now  increased  the  number  of  modern  stations  AEIC  can  provide  to  aug-
ment  this  sparse  improvement,  and  provides  enhanced  information  on  local  earth-
quakes through applied research efforts. However, even with the funding of both the 
NTHMP and the University TWEAK program, nearly 75 percent of the Alaska seis-
mic  network  still  relies  on  outdated  equipment,  leaving  vast  areas  of  Alaska  (and 
in particular the very seismically active Aleutian Islands) still under-populated with 
modern seismic stations.

formation and robust earthquake size.

large magnitude 9+ earthquakes that can occur in the region.

To improve this situation we propose to augment the network with:
• 20 Modern broad band seismic stations with high dynamic range and frequency 
• 20  Modern  strong  motion  seismic  sensors  that  will  stay  on  scale  for  even  the 
• 20 continuously reporting GPS sensors that can directly measure permanent de-
• Modern tide gauges.
• Modern  satellite  telemetry  to  record  seismic  and  deformation  signals  in  real 
time  at  the  Alaska  Earthquake  Information  Center  and  the  Alaska  Tsunami 
Warning Center.
• Near real time processing of the combined signals to rapidly estimate the earth-
quake  size,  and  distribution  of  deformation.  This  gives  direct  and  rapid  esti-
mates of tsunami potential.
• A  prototype  multi-observing  deep  ocean  buoy  system  consisting  of  at  least  an 
ocean  bottom  pressure  sensor  and  an  ocean  bottom  seismometer  giving  lateral 
constraint to the land based seismic network.

Unique  to  this  effort  is  the  co-location  of  modern  seismic  and  GPS  instrumenta-
tion.  The  combined  observations  give  rich  information  for  the  rapid  determination 
of earthquake location, size, and distribution of sea floor deformation that generates 
tsunamis. 
Hazard Assessment 

Tsunami warning and safety procedures require an understanding of hazards and 
risks  associated  with  tsunamis.  Alaska  researchers  at  UAF  are  evaluating  the  risk 
by  constructing  inundation  maps  for  at-risk  communities  through  super  computer 
modeling of the tsunami water waves from scenario earthquakes and landslides. Re-
liable modeling results, however, require that we have accurate bathymetry to a res-
olution  that  is  not  generally  available  in  Alaska.  Much  of  the  sea  floor  along  the 
shallow  waters  off  the  coast  of  Alaska  have  not  been  mapped  in  many  years.  Some 
areas  have  not  been  mapped  since  before  the  1964  Prince  William  Sound  M9.2 
earthquake (Note that large earthquakes can change bathymetry in local regions of 
the  sea  floor  by  tens  of  meters.).  Collection  of  improved  bathymetry  is  necessary 
along Alaska’s coastal communities and should be a top priority for our pilot project 
area. 

High  resolution  modeling  and  mapping  is  needed  to  identify  potential  areas  for 
evacuation  and  lifeline  infrastructure  at  risk.  As  a  part  of  the  pilot  project  at  least 
one community at risk should be selected for acquisition of very high resolution ba-
thymetry.  This  data  will  enable  the  construction  of  very  detailed  flooding  maps  for

the  community.  Benefits  of  this  process  include  the  enhanced  understanding  of  the 
local  risk,  construction  of  evacuation  routes  for  the  community,  and  an  evaluation 
of  the  capabilities  (and  potential  errors)  of  numerical  modeling  and  forecasting  of 
tsunamis with the highest quality data available. The models would then be hosted 
for evaluation by the research community as part of the Alaska Region Super Com-
puter  Center  tsunami  portal  system  developed  as  part  of  the  TWEAK  program.  A 
candidate  community  for  this  evaluation  is  Akutan.  Akutan  has  one  of  the  largest 
communities in the Aleutian Islands, which supports the largest fishing industry in 
the  United  States.  Other  candidate  communities  could  include  Sand  Point,  Adak, 
Dutch Harbor, and a host of others among Alaska’s 76 coastal communities. 
Mitigation 

Last,  but  not  least,  to  tie  together  all  the  components  of  tsunami  identification 
and warning with the hazard assessment, the pilot community needs a comprehen-
sive  public  education  program.  It  is  important  to  recognize  that  tsunami  warning 
systems  must  go  beyond  just  the  ability  to  detect  a  tsunami  and  send  a  warning 
message.  The  most  important  aspect  of  tsunami  warning  systems  is  the  existence 
of  a  mechanism  for  disseminating  warning  information  to  the  people  on  the  shore-
lines, and for the recipient of the warning message to understand how to react. Tsu-
nami  hazard  mitigation  requires  a  long-term  sustained  effort  of  continuing  public 
education, and responsible planning decisions in coastal communities. 

The power of education is clear. 
The  State  of  Alaska  partners’  are  well  aware  of  our  difficulties  in  reaching  our 
76  communities  at  risk  to  tsunamis.  Enhancing  the  warning  communication  and 
outreach  infrastructure  at  the  state  and  local  level  for  both  emergency  managers 
and  the  public  represents  the  most  important  improvement  to  be  made  in  Alaska 
for saving lives. 

through media, community workshops, and other means.

Among the pilot project community enhancements to be made include:
• Tsunami  training  for  schools  at  all  grade  levels—Adult  public  education 
• Exercises and drills for elected officials, schools, and the general public.
• Focus groups for mitigation, contingency and continuity planning workshops for

essential services and tsunami-at-risk businesses.

dian Ocean.)

Tied  to  this  effort  will  be  an  enhanced  technical  communication  infrastructure 
package that can ensure tsunami warnings are broadcast to people along the coast-
lines  or  in  their  homes,  businesses,  and  boats.  Within  the  pilot  community,  we  will 
explore all possible communication possibilities, including but not limited to:

• Local  alert  and  notification  communication  equipment  such  as  the  Emergency 
Management  Weather  Information  Network,  NOAA  Weather  Radios  for  indoor 
use,  and  All  Hazard  Alert  Broadcasting  (AHAB)  Siren  and  Radio  for  outdoor 
use.
• Support  from  Alaska  Division  of  Homeland  Security  and  Emergency  Manage-
ment  professionals  for  disseminating  existing  alert  notification,  and  other  en-
hanced  communication  protocols,  to  ensure  tsunami  warning  and  evacuation 
messages can be received by the public rapidly and effectively.

The key to success is developing a strong communications link from the Tsunami 
Warning  Center  to  a  hazard  control  center  or  emergency  contact  point  that  can  be 
assured of receiving and relaying the warnings to the local people through the above 
considerations.
Summary 

In  summary,  Alaska  has  partnerships  in  place  to  address  the  threat  from 
tsunamis.  Yet  we  still  have  continuing  needs  for  improved  monitoring  with  seismic 
and  tide  gauge  networks,  scientific  infrastructure  for  numerical  forecasting  of 
tsunamis, and the civil infrastructure to educate and warn people. 

This  pilot  will  demonstrate  the  techniques  and  procedures  necessary  to  enhance 
the  delivery  of  hazard  warnings  to  very  remote  areas  of  the  world.  It  will  focus  on 
an  integrated  approach  of  improved  monitoring,  coupled  with  extensive  hazard  and 
risk  assessment  and  quantification,  tied  together  with  a  strong  approach  for  edu-
cation  and  outreach,  and  reliable  information  delivery.  In  addition,  the  enhanced 
monitoring  with  world  class  multi-use  sensing  stations  will  allow  for  rapid  evalua-
tion  of  earthquake  size  and  characteristics,  estimates  of  the  deformation  of  the  sea 
floor,  and  more  accurate  forecasting  of  tele-tsunamis  that  would  potentially  impact

Ocean. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO

CHARLES G. GROAT 

Question  1.  Dr.  Groat,  I  understand  that  the  Cascadia  Subduction  zone  off  the 
coast  of  Washington  state  is  similar  to  the  fault  that  produced  the  Indian  Ocean 
tsunami.  The  last  major  Cascadia  quake  on  January  26,  1700  caused  30-foot  high 
tsunamis  that  inundated  the  Washington  coastline.  In  your  testimony,  you  stated 
that  USGS  scientists  and  others  have  estimated  that  there  is  a  10–14  percent 
chance  of  a  repeat  of  the  Cascadia  magnitude  9  earthquake  and  tsunami  event  in 
the next 50 years. What is the basis for this estimate? 

Answer.  The  10–14  percent  probability  of  having  a  magnitude–9  earthquake  on 
the  Cascadia  subduction  zone  in  the  next  50  years  was  derived  from  the  average 
recurrence  time  of  these  great  earthquakes  observed  in  studies  of  coastal  subsid-
ence.  For  example,  at  Willapa  Bay,  WA  there  are  wetland  soils  that  were  buried 
during  coastal  subsidence  that  occurred  during  great  Cascadia  earthquakes.  These 
buried soils are evidence that seven great earthquakes occurred along the Cascadia 
subduction zone during the past 3500 years. The dates of when these soils were bur-
ied are consistent with the dates of subsidence events found at other locations along 
the  Pacific  Northwest  coast,  further  supporting  the  concept  that  these  buried  soils 
record the occurrence of great earthquakes along the coast. The ages of these buried 
soils  indicate  an  average  recurrence  time  of  about  500  years  for  great  Cascadia 
earthquakes.  The  USGS  used  this  average  recurrence  time  to  get  two  probability 
estimates  for  the  next  50  years:  the  10  percent  estimate  is  derived  from  a  model 
that  does  not  consider  the  time  from  the  last  earthquake  and  the  14  percent  esti-
mate  is  derived  from  a  model  that  considers  the  time  since  the  last  great  Cascadia 
earthquake  (in  1700  A.D.)  and  the  variability  in  the  recurrence  time  of  past  great 
earthquakes as seen in the record of buried soils.

Question  1a.  Please  explain  what  makes  this  fault  especially  prone  to  generating 

a tsunami-causing earthquake. 

Answer.  Nearly  all  of  the  world’s  major  tsunamis  occur  in  subduction  zones.  The 
geometry between two adjacent tectonic plates in subduction zones gives rise to the 
possibility  of  tsunami  generation  in  areas  like  Cascadia,  where  the  offshore  Juan 
de  Fuca  plate  is  moving  landward  about  1.5  inches  per  year.  Because  the  rocks  in 
the Juan de Fuca plate are more dense than the rocks in the North American plate, 
the  Juan  de  Fuca  plate  begins  to  dip  slightly  into  the  earth  just  off  the  Pacific 
Coast.  The  contact  between  the  two  plates  is  the  Cascadia  fault.  Unlike  the  San 
Andreas fault, which is nearly vertical, the Cascadia fault is nearly horizontal. This 
shallow,  dipping,  geometry  establishes  a  very  wide  contact  area—perhaps  as  much 
as  60–80  miles—between  the  two  plates.  The  wide  contact  area  combines  with  the 
600-mile  length  of  Cascadia  to  give  a  huge  earthquake  fault  area.  When  an  earth-
quake occurs on the Cascadia fault, there is as much as 30–60 feet of displacement 
of one plate against the other, and that motion can cause rapid changes in the level 
of the sea floor, resulting in tsunamis. 

Not  all  subduction-zone  earthquakes  generate  damaging  tsunamis.  If  the  fault 
displacement  does  not  cause  significant  movement  on  the  ocean  floor,  then  only 
small  waves  are  generated.  In  some  cases,  the  initial  earthquake  ground  shaking 
may  generate  huge  underwater  landslides  that  can  either  produce  their  own 
tsunamis or complicate a tsunami generated by displacement of the ocean floor. Al-
though most tsunamis are generated in the world’s active subduction zones such as 
Cascadia,  occasionally  large  gravity-driven  slumps  have  occurred  elsewhere  that 
produced significant waves. 

One issue that needs more study in Cascadia is the effectiveness of existing warn-
ing systems in the event that only a portion of the subduction zone ruptures. In the 
case where the entire subduction zone from Vancouver Island to northern California 
ruptures,  the  immediate  response  of  coastal  residents  must  be  keyed  on  the  strong 
ground shaking. However, the geologic record shows that earthquakes are more fre-
quent  in  the  northern  California-southern  Oregon  portion  of  Cascadia  than  off  the 
Washington  coast.  If  only  a  portion  of  the  subduction  zone  breaks  during  an  earth-
quake,  then  warning  systems  could  be  used  to  help  guide  initial  response  on  the 
portion of the coast adjacent to the immediate earthquake area. The June 14, 2005, 
magnitude–7.1 earthquake off northern California highlighted the need for strength-
ening  seismic  warning  systems  to  provide  better  guidance  to  state  officials  in  the 
event  of  the  next  Cascadia  earthquake  rupturing  along  only  a  portion  of  the  coast.

Question  2.  Dr.  Groat,  I  understand  that  a  tsunami  generated  by  an  earthquake 
along  the  Cascadia  fault  could  reach  the  coast  of  Washington  state  within  10–20 
minutes.  I’m  concerned  because  only  three  Washington  towns  are  considered  pre-
pared  under  the  TsunamiReady  program,  meaning  that  many,  many  coastal  resi-
dents  would  not  have  adequate  time  to  escape  a  tsunami.  Would  the  USGS  earth-
quake notification system be able to notify coastal communities in time to allow for 
an orderly evacuation? 

Answer. It is important to distinguish the roles of the USGS and NOAA with re-
gard  to  notifying  the  public  about  tsunamis.  The  USGS  supplies  earthquake  data 
to  the  NOAA  West  Coast/Alaska  Tsunami  Warning  Center  (WC/ATWC)  in  Palmer, 
AK, which is responsible for issuing warnings to coastal Washington. While the WC/
ATWC  receives  USGS  earthquake  data  within  seconds,  it  takes  their  seismologists 
a  few  minutes  to  process  the  data  and  obtain  a  reliable  earthquake  location  and 
magnitude and for the duty seismologist to execute the response procedures. Under 
optimal  conditions  the  WC/ATWC  can  issue  warnings  as  rapidly  as  two  minutes 
after the earthquake. 

The  USGS  is  also  supporting  the  development  of  software  like  California  Inte-
grated Seismic Network (CISN) Display that enable emergency managers to receive 
notification  about  earthquakes  and  tsunami  warnings  quickly  as  they  are  distrib-
uted by USGS and NOAA. This technology eliminates any delays in information dis-
tribution  and  portrays  the  earthquake  data  on  maps  that  can  be  customized  with 
local  highways,  hospital  locations,  and  other  geographic  features.  The  President’s 
tsunami  warning  initiative  provides  funding  to  enhance  CISN  Display  and  provide 
it to coastal emergency managers. 

Even  though  the  goal  of  the  USGS  is  to  put  automated  earthquake  information 
into the hands of the emergency management community and the public within sec-
onds,  and  likewise  the  WC/ATWC  strives  to  issue  tsunami  warnings  within  a  few 
minutes,  it  will  be  difficult,  if  not  impossible,  for  many  communities  to  successfully 
evacuate  all  citizens  in  inundation  zones  within  20  minutes.  For  that  reason,  edu-
cation about tsunami hazards and proper evacuation procedures, land-use planning, 
and  construction  of  structures  that  enable  vertical  evacuation  will  all  be  necessary 
to reduce the loss of life from a tsunami generated by a repeat of the 1700 Cascadia 
earthquake. 

In  an  effort  to  further  coordinate  U.S.  national  response  to  the  threat  from 
tsunamis,  USGS  and  NOAA  co-led  two  separate  task  groups  organized  by  the  Na-
tional  Science  and  Technology  Council  Subcommittee  on  Disaster  Reduction  and 
U.S. Group on Earth Observations: ‘‘Tsunami Lessons Learned Interim Report’’ pro-
vides  a  first  look  at  what  lessons  can  be  taken  from  the  December  26,  2004  earth-
quake and tsunami, and ‘‘Tsunami Risk Reduction for the United States: A Frame-
work for Action’’ provides a national plan to reduce future losses. These reports are 
expected to be released shortly.

Question 3. Dr. Groat, I understand that the goal of USGS’s National Earthquake 
Information  Center  (NEIC)  is  to  rapidly  determine  location  and  size  of  all  destruc-
tive earthquakes and immediately disseminate that information to the public. I un-
derstand  this  to  be  critical  because  a  person  on  the  ground  can’t  tell  if  the  earth-
quake  they  just  felt  was  a  little  one  under  their  feet,  or  a  huge  one  off  the  coast 
that  may  be  followed  by  a  tsunami.  However,  I  understand  that  in  previous  in-
stances, such as the Nisqually Earthquake that gave Seattle quite a shake in 2001, 
NEIC  notification  came  in  too  late  to  inform  and  improve  emergency  response  ef-
forts.  For  this  reason,  I’m  pleased  to  see  that  under  the  Administration’s  proposal, 
the  NEIC  would  upgrade  their  operations  and  be  able  to  provide  24  hour,  7  day  a 
week  notification.  It  is  my  understanding  that  a  Cascadia  fault  generated  earth-
quake  would  give  Washington  state  coastal  communities  only  10  to  20  minutes  of 
time  to  evacuate.  Is  it  possible  to  reach  a  two  minute  performance  standard  for 
issuing tsunami warnings? 

Answer.  The  speed  at  which  seismic  networks  can  report  about  an  earthquake  is 
governed  by  the  number  of  seismic  stations  in  the  vicinity  of  the  earthquake  and 
the  speed  at  which  seismic  monitoring  systems  can  calculate  earthquake  location 
and  magnitudes.  For  example,  the  coastal  region  of  Washington  is  monitored  by 
seismic stations of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN), operated by the 
University of Washington with funding from USGS. Data from the PNSN is contin-
ually  transmitted  to  the  WC/ATWC  within  seconds  as  a  result  of  system  upgrades 
funded by the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program. As a result of this co-
operative  effort  and  because  NOAA  staff  were  on  duty  at  the  time  of  the  earth-
quake,  the  WC/ATWC  released  the  Nisqually  earthquake  location  and  magnitude 
within  2  minutes.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  PNSN,  like  other  U.S.  seismic  net-
works participating in the ANSS, typically releases automated earthquake informa-
tion within 3–5 minutes.

123

Despite  improvements  in  the  speed  in  which  USGS  or  NOAA  systems  can  com-
pute location and magnitude and rapid human response, the goal of reaching a two 
minute performance standard for issuing tsunami warnings is only possible if there 
are  sufficient  seismic  stations  in  the  epicentral  area.  For  quakes  that  occur  in  re-
mote  areas  of  the  planet  where  the  nearest  seismic  stations  are  many  hundreds  of 
miles  away,  it  can  take  10  minutes  for  sufficient  data  to  be  available  for  a  seismic 
network  to  release  a  reliable  location  and  magnitude.  Although  10  minutes  may 
seem  like  a  long  time  to  locate  a  distant  earthquake,  the  transit  times  for  distant 
tsunamis to reach U.S. shores are on the order of hours. 

Just  as  the  PNSN  provides  seismic  data  to  the  ATWC  ,  the  NEIC  also  provides 
continuous  transmission  of  data  from  seismic  stations  around  the  globe  to  the  WC/
ATWC  in  order  for  them  to  be  able  to  issue  tsunami  warnings  as  fast  as  possible. 
With the planned upgrades for the NEIC with funding from the President’s tsunami 
warning  initiative,  the  NEIC  is  standing  up  24×7  operations  and  upgrading  their 
software and hardware systems. Like the WC/ATWC, it will then be possible for the 
ANSS  to  release  authoritative  and  reviewed  earthquake  information  at  the  same 
speed at which the WC/ATWC releases earthquake information. 

We  again  want  to  emphasize  that  it  is  unlikely  that  a  2-minute  performance 
standard would be sufficient to guarantee successful evacuation of all citizens in in-
undation  zones.  However,  quick,  reliable  earthquake  locations  can  be  used  to  ‘‘turn 
off’’ initial activities that began with felt ground shaking. As noted above, the USGS 
is working to distribute these locations through such systems as CISN Display. The 
USGS  is  also  working  to  provide  a  more  complete  description  of  the  earthquake 
within minutes by automatically delivering ShakeMaps to emergency responders so 
that they can see the extent of strong shaking in their region. ShakeMaps also serve 
as input to the HAZUS program for rapidly calculating the expected losses from an 
earthquake.

Question  4.  Dr.  Groat,  I’ve  heard  that  coordination  and  cooperation  between 
NOAA, NSF, and USGS is very poor leading to lots of inefficiencies. Given the possi-
bility of only 10 to 20 minutes warning, it is very important to me that both USGS 
and NOAA work together to disseminate information as fast as possible. Please ex-
plain  how  current  procedures  could  be  improved  to  ensure  communication  and  dis-
semination of critical information. 

Answer.  Since  1997,  the  USGS  and  NOAA  have  successfully  partnered  on  tsu-
nami  warning  efforts  under  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program 
(NTHMP) in cooperation with FEMA and the five Pacific states. The USGS installed 
dedicated  data  circuits  connecting  the  two  NOAA  Tsunami  Warning  Centers  to  the 
ANSS  to  ensure  reliable  data  exchange.  USGS  installed  53  new  seismic  stations  in 
Alaska,  California,  Hawaii,  Oregon  and  Washington  to  support  improved  earth-
quake  detection  for  tsunami  warnings  and  collaborated  with  NOAA  staff  in  the  in-
stallation  of  USGS  seismological  software  in  the  Tsunami  Warning  Centers.  As  de-
scribed above, the WC/ATWC also submits their calculations of earthquake location 
and  magnitude  into  the  ANSS  earthquake  information  distribution  system.  The 
USGS and NOAA meet regularly under the auspices of the NTHMP to discuss how 
we could improve cooperation and coordination, and the level of cooperation between 
the ANSS operations and Tsunami Warning Center operations is excellent. 

In  addition,  USGS  scientists  often  are  active  collaborators  with  NOAA  scientists 
in performing tsunami inundation modeling. USGS scientists are tasked with speci-
fying the ‘‘source characteristics’’ (e.g., the dimensions, orientation, and the amount 
of fault movement) of anticipated earthquakes for the models. The USGS has an ac-
tive research program to investigate the geologic evidence from historic tsunamis to 
gain  a  better  understanding  of  the  amount  of  wave  run-up  and  frequency  of  occur-
rence.  These  studies  guide  the  inundation  modeling  of  NOAA  scientists  and  form 
the basis for mitigation planning. 

The  USGS,  NOAA,  and  FEMA  all  belong  to  the  State-Local  Tsunami  Working 
group  convened  quarterly  by  Washington  Emergency  Management.  The  working 
group  seeks  to  implement  directions  and  programs  developed  by  the  NTHMP  and 
provide  guidance  back  to  the  national  program.  These  meetings  involve  local  emer-
gency  managers  from  all  Washington  coastal  counties  and  outside  experts  as  re-
quired by the items being discussed (e.g., a structural engineer, business continuity 
planner, etc.). 

The key to coordination among agencies in the NTHMP is the twice-yearly meet-

agencies  and  the  five  Pacific  States.  The  NTHMP  has  used  the  steering  committee

ing  full  advantage  of  this  coordination  by  calling  routinely  on  the  federal  partners 
to help improve public safety efforts in the state. 

As a research granting agency, the National Science Foundation is not directly in-
volved with NTHMP or tsunami response. However, USGS and NSF collaborate ex-
tensively  on  research  activities  that  contribute  to  an  improved  understanding  of 
Earth processes that lead to earthquake generation. An important aspect of that col-
laboration is NSF’s EarthScope initiative, which is establishing a dense array of geo-
detic  stations  along  the  western  boundary  of  the  North  American  tectonic  plate  to 
better understand plate interactions. EarthScope also includes a drilling project into 
the  San  Andreas  fault,  and  a  moving  array  of  seismic  stations  to  image  the  crust 
and deep structure of the continent. In all three projects, USGS scientists are close-
ly  collaborating  with  their  NSF  and  university  counterparts.  NSF  and  USGS  are 
partners in the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (along with FEMA 
and  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology).  NEHRP  is  focused  on 
translating research into on-the-ground earthquake loss reduction.

Question  5.  Dr.  Groat,  on  my  recent  visit  to  PMEL,  I  learned  that  Washington 
State  is  vulnerable  not  only  to  tsunamis  generated  by  distant  earthquakes  in  the 
North  Pacific  Ocean  or  the  closer  Cascadia  subduction  zone,  but  also  from  faults 
within  the  Puget  Sound.  In  fact,  there  is  a  fault  line  that  goes  right  across  Puget 
Sound  and  downtown  Seattle.  Can  you  tell  me  the  current  plans  to  analyze  the 
earthquake risk for this fault? Are there other technologies that could provide more 
timely warning to these inland areas? 

Answer.  Pacific  Northwest  earthquakes  occur  in  three  source  zones:  along  the 
Cascadia subduction zone boundary, within the subducting Juan de Fuca plate and 
within the crust of the overlying North American plate. Earthquakes from all three 
zones threaten the Puget Sound and western Washington, but a large crustal earth-
quake would have very severe consequences in Seattle and other cities. 

Crustal zone earthquakes, typically of small magnitudes and usually not felt, are 
the  most  common  earthquakes  in  western  Washington.  Crustal  earthquakes  have 
been as large as magnitude 5.5 in the last 40 years but have produced little damage. 
The  initiation  points  (hypocenters)  of  earthquakes  located  beneath  Puget  Sound 
form  a  dense  cloud  of  locations  in  the  crust  and  do  not  define  linear  fault  zones  as 
seen  in  California.  For  many  years,  the  lack  of  clear  trends  in  the  located  earth-
quakes,  coupled  with  a  lack  of  known  surface  evidence  in  the  form  of  fault  scarps, 
contributed to the uncertainty as to how best to account for the possibility of crustal 
earthquakes in hazard assessments. 

There  are  three  major  fault  zones—the  Seattle,  the  Tacoma,  and  the  Southern 
Whidbey  Island—that  cut  through  the  heavily  urbanized  regions  of  central  Puget 
Sound.  Of  these,  the  Seattle  fault  is  the  best  studied  and  because  of  its  proximity 
to so many people and infrastructure, is the most critical feature of regional hazard 
assessments.  Although  known  for  many  years  based  on  regional  geology  and  geo-
physics, until 1992 there was no evidence that the Seattle fault was active. In that 
year,  paleoseismologists  showed  that  large  changes  in  the  elevation  of  prehistoric 
beaches, in some cases as much as 22 feet, occurred during a very large earthquake 
on  the  Seattle  fault  about  a  thousand  years  ago.  This  large  displacement  is  con-
sistent  with  an  earthquake  of  about  magnitude  7.  However,  even  with  these  large 
vertical  motions,  the  exact  location  of  the  Seattle  fault  was  still  poorly  known.  The 
portion  of  the  fault  thought  to  be  responsible  for  the  elevation  changes  has  yet  to 
be found. 

Nevertheless, the discovery of the vertical land elevation changes sparked consid-
erable  research  on  the  fault.  In  1994  a  basic  model  was  developed  linking  the  Se-
attle fault to the Seattle basin; the Seattle basin is a deep (5 miles in places) struc-
tural  feature  roughly  centered  beneath  downtown  Seattle  and  Bellevue.  A  regional 
aeromagnetic experiment suggested the location of three strands of the Seattle fault. 
These  strands  curve  from  southern  Bainbridge  Island  through  south  Seattle  before 
bending more northeastward and crossing Lake Washington to the greater Bellevue 
area. 

The  introduction  of  LIDAR  flights—Lidar  stands  for  light  detecting  and  ranging 
similar  to  radar,  which  stands  for  radio  detecting  and  ranging—  over  the  Seattle 
fault  on  Bainbridge  Island  in  1998  allowed  geologists  to  find  the  fault  in  the  field 
for  the  first  time.  With  a  precision  of  about  20  centimeters,  LIDAR  can  map  very 
subtle changes in the surface topography, and allows scientists to organize features 
of the landscape. In particular, short linear features that might be missed with con-
ventional  topography  are  easily  highlighted  with  LIDAR  data.  Field  trenching  very 
rapidly discovered several earthquakes on the Seattle fault on and near Bainbridge 
Island.  USGS  Geologists  also  found  evidence  for  an  active  scarp  near  Vasa  Park  in 
southeastern Bellevue.

USGS  has  used  LIDAR  since  1998  to  document  at  least  eight  faults  from  the 
southeastern Olympic Peninsula to Whidbey Island that have had large earthquakes 
of magnitude 6.5 or greater during the last few thousand years, and there are many 
additional  faults  that  have  now  been  identified  that  need  thorough  study.  Ground 
motions from crustal earthquakes of moderate size, magnitude 6–6.7, produce strong 
shaking on hard rock that can have major effects on buildings and lifelines. 

Fieldwork  on  various  strands  of  the  Seattle  fault  documents  three  or  more  large 
earthquakes  in  the  last  few  thousand  years.  By  modeling  the  expected  ground  mo-
tions from these earthquakes, seismologists can show that the ground and buildings 
will  shake  very  hard  when  they  next  strike.  The  scientific  and  engineering  under-
standing  of  the  large  crustal  earthquakes  on  the  Seattle  fault  is  now  well  accepted 
and  the  USGS  joined  seven  other  agencies  and  organizations  to  develop  a  detailed 
scenario  of  the  consequences  of  a  major  earthquake  on  the  Seattle  fault.  The  sce-
nario,  published  in  June  2005  by  the  Earthquake  Engineering  Research  Institute 
and  Washington  Emergency  Management,  is  being  used  to  help  the  region  develop 
a more aggressive strategy to lower losses from future events. 

Unfortunately,  for  crustal  earthquakes  in  urban  areas,  there  is  little  prospect  of 
providing warning of possible tsunamis, because the travel time of the first arriving 
wave  will  be  a  few  minutes  at  most.  Thus,  as  with  the  offshore  Cascadia  events, 
sustained  public  education  is  the  best  way  to  lower  losses  and  save  lives  in  the 
event  of  strong  shaking  in  Puget  Sound.  It  is  also  why  the  region  puts  such  a  high 
premium on completing a full inventory of possible active faults using LIDAR data. 
Without  LIDAR,  possible  crustal  faults  that  could  be  tsunami  sources  in  northern 
Puget Sound will be almost impossible to evaluate. 

Investigating  the  possibility  of  tsunamis  in  Puget  Sound  is  a  good  example  of 
USGS–NOAA  cooperation.  Under  the  NTHMP,  Washington  State  asked  USGS  and 
NOAA  to  consider  this  issue.  The  USGS  and  NOAA  jointly  convened  a  panel  of  ex-
perts  to  discuss  shallow  earthquake  faults  in  the  inland  waters  and  consider  their 
potential to generate tsunamis. Washington State’s request was built on the Seattle 
fault  geologic  history,  which  generated  a  tsunami  about  1100  years  ago.  That  tsu-
nami overtopped the site of the current West Point Wastewater Treatment plant in 
Seattle and has been traced as far north as Whidbey Island. 

The expert panel developed reasonable fault parameters for several major crustal 
faults that cross the inland waters. NOAA has completed modeling a worst-case sce-
nario for the Seattle fault and is now beginning modeling on the Tacoma fault. Fu-
ture modeling will likely include the Southern Whidbey Island fault and the Devils 
Mountain-Darrington fault. Modeling of the last fault is hindered by a lack of high-
resolution topographic data from LIDAR along much of the fault trace. 

Much of Seattle and the surrounding area is underlain by poorly consolidated gla-
cial materials that may be prone to landslides during earthquakes in areas of steep 
slopes.  In  addition,  the  inland  waters  of  Washington  are  subject  to  landslides  that 
sometimes  cause  local  tsunamis.  Although  not  nearly  as  widespread  as  other  types 
of  tsunamis,  landslide  driven  tsunamis  may  have  very  high  local  run-up.  Again,  at 
the  request  of  Washington  State,  USGS  and  NOAA  held  a  meeting  to  assess  pos-
sible  landslide  tsunami  sources  in  the  inland  waters.  Using  a  series  of  maps  show-
ing  steep,  geologically  unstable  slopes  and  deep  waters,  the  panel  designated  sec-
tions  of  the  inland  waters  as  more  likely  than  others  to  generate  tsunamis.  NOAA 
is  now  studying  the  best  way  to  use  the  source  areas  in  developing  models  of  pos-
sible tsunami inundation areas from landslides.

Question  6.  Dr.  Groat,  I  understand  that  it  is  most  likely  that  a  tsunami  hitting 
the Washington coast would originate from an earthquake along the Cascadia plate 
rather  than  a  deep  ocean  earthquake.  I  also  understand  that  there  may  be  several 
ways  to  make  our  current  tsunami  warning  system  more  effective  for  mitigating 
hazards.  For  example,  the  NSF’s  NEPTUNE  program  to  wire  the  Juan  de  Fuca 
plate  with  fiber  optic  lines  seems  to  be  supportive  of  these  efforts.  Do  you  feel  that 
there  are  other  technologies  or  approaches  Congress  should  consider  funding  that 
might produce more timely warning for near shore generated tsunamis? 

Answer.  There  are  certainly  many  reasons  to  take  advantage  of  collaborative  op-
portunities in the region. Already, USGS and the University of Washington are col-
laborating with the NSF-sponsored Earthscope initiative that will improve deforma-
tion  monitoring  and  seismic  capabilities  in  the  region.  With  respect  to  NEPTUNE, 
there  have  been  discussions  between  the  university  departments  responsible  for 
NEPTUNE  and  the  Pacific  Northwest  Seismic  Network  about  studying  possible  de-
ployment of offshore seismometers. 

The  greatest  benefit  of  offshore  seismometers  would  be  more  reliable  earthquake 
locations for events occurring there. Some offshore seismometers might help resolve 
the  forces  producing  the  occasional  offshore  earthquake  west  of  Oregon  and  Wash-
ington,  and  that  would  give  seismologists  a  better  understanding  of  these  events.

However, improved locations would still be within the time constraints discussed in 
the above questions, meaning that ongoing, consistent education would remain their 
best  hope  for  people  on  the  beach  of  surviving  a  devastating  Cascadia  earthquake 
and tsunami.

Question  7.  Dr.  Groat,  confronted  with  a  fresh  reminder  of  the  potential  devasta-
tion  of  an  off-shore,  tsunami-causing  earthquake,  I  share  Senator  Stevens’  concern 
about  ensuring  sufficient  warning  systems  are  in  place  so  that  loss  of  human  life 
can  be  minimized.  Senator  Stevens  requested  an  estimation  of  what  it  would  take 
to  establish  a  comprehensive  tsunami  notification  system.  I  am  very  interested  in 
your response and ask that you please forward me a copy of your answer to Senator 
Stevens’ question. 

Answer.  Sen.  Stevens  and  Sen.  Inouye  jointly  asked  USGS  to  explain  how  we 
could  improve  public  notification  of  impending  natural  hazards  and  disasters.  The 
components of the USGS answer related to earthquakes and tsunamis follow: 

The  USGS  could  improve  public  hazard  notification  and  warning  of  natural  haz-
ards  in  three  basic  areas:  (1)  modernization  and  expansion  of  seismic  monitoring 
networks;  (2)  increased  robustness  and  redundancy  of  electronic  communication 
links;  and,  (3)  accelerated  development  and  deployment  of  capabilities  to  take  full 
advantage  of  new  data  streams,  research  findings  and  communication  technologies 
to improve the accuracy and timeliness of information we provide for emergency re-
sponse and management. 
(1) Modernization and expansion of monitoring networks 

The  President’s  proposal  for  improving  tsunami  warning  systems  would  replace 
legacy  hardware  and  software  systems  at  the  USGS  National  Earthquake  Informa-
tion  Center  (NEIC)  and  establish  24×7  operations,  actions  that  will  improve  re-
sponse time, benefiting both earthquake notification and tsunami warning. The pro-
posal  also  includes  support  to  improve  station  up-time  in  the  Global  Seismographic 
Network  (GSN)—a  partnership  of  USGS,  the  National  Science  Foundation,  the  In-
corporated  Research  Institutions  for  Seismology,  and  the  University  of  California—
and to install additional stations in the Caribbean region. The NEIC modernization 
is a key component of the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS). As described 
in USGS Circular 1188, the ANSS plan includes both notification and early warning 
of earthquakes as fundamental goals. 
(2) Robust telemetry and communication links 

For  rapid-onset  events  like  earthquakes,  tsunamis,  volcanic  eruptions  and  land-
slides, only real-time systems can provide data in sufficient time to issue actionable 
notifications  and  warnings.  The  funding  in  the  FY  2005  Emergency  Supplemental 
for  improved  tsunami  detection  and  warning  system  for  the  United  States,  along 
with the funding in the 2006 budget for the same purpose, will expand and improve 
telemetry  connections  to  monitoring  stations,  so  that  the  seismic  stations  in  the 
Global  Seismographic  Network  provide  real-time  data.  This  will  contribute  to  de-
creasing  the  reporting  time  for  global  earthquakes  from  over  one  hour  to  about 
twenty minutes. 

USGS  data  and  products  often  travel  across  a  web  of  communications  links  from 
the  monitoring  network  to  the  public,  typically  involving  satellite  uplinks  and 
downlinks,  the  Internet,  and  radio  or  television  bands.  Although  some  USGS  sys-
tems  employ  redundant  links  (e.g.,  satellite,  phone  lines,  and/or  Internet  commu-
nications),  in  many  cases  the  communications  channels  are  vulnerable  to  a  single 
point  of  failure.  Hardening  of  these  telecommunication  links  is  essential  to  ensure 
a reliable warning system is available with the appropriate level of redundancy. 
As part of the NEIC upgrade, the President’s proposal calls for 24×7 network op-
erations  and  robust  Internet  serving  of  seismic  data.  It  would  also  increase  the 
number  of  USGS-operated  GSN  stations  that  provide  real-time  data  to  NEIC  and 
the NOAA tsunami warning centers. Currently, only 80% of GSN stations have dig-
ital  telemetry  links  that  allow  for  real-time  communication.  Both  for  the  GSN  and 
the ANSS, a fully telemetered system with redundant communications links will im-
prove response time for damaging earthquakes. 
(3) New capabilities 

The  President’s  proposal  for  upgrading  NEIC  will  accelerate  development  of  sev-
eral  rapid-response  products,  including  the  Prompt  Assessment  of  Global  Earth-
quakes  for  Response  (PAGER)  system,  which  uses  information  about  an  earth-
quake’s  source,  combined  with  information  regarding  population  and  infrastructure 
in the affected region to estimate potential damage and loss of life in a major earth-
quake. The PAGER system is ideal for both domestic and international areas where

a  dense  seismic  network  is  not  available,  but  where  a  rapid  assessment  is  critical 
for estimating impact. 

The USGS is exploring the feasibility of earthquake detection and early warning, 
in which rapid computer analysis and communication links are used to provide sec-
onds of warning before earthquake waves arrive. Such warning systems are in place 
in Japan, Mexico and Taiwan. The 2000 reauthorization of the National Earthquake 
Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) called for development of a U.S. early warn-
ing system for earthquakes. The USGS currently sponsors modest research and de-
velopment  in  this  area,  including  research  on  earthquake  early  warning  feasibility 
and  efforts  to  improve  the  numbers  of  seismic  stations  reporting  in  real  time  and 
the speed and reliability of earthquake reporting.

Tsunami and Earthquake Program Compatibility. As you may know, Congress re-
cently enacted this Committee’s reauthorization of the multi-agency National Earth-
quake  Hazard  Mitigation  Program  (NEHRP),  which  is  aimed  at  both  improving 
earthquake  detection  and  community  resilience  to  earthquakes—including  building 
construction and planning guidelines. Similarly, S. 50, would authorize NOAA’s Na-
tional  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program  (NTHMP),  another  multi-agency  pro-
gram involving many of the witnesses here today.

Question  1.  Looking  at  these  two  programs  together,  are  the  activities  of  the 
Earthquake  Program  consistent  with  the  goals  of  the  Tsunami  program?  For  in-
stance, is a building designed to be earthquake resilient also designed to be resilient 
against tsunami? 

Answer.  Because  earthquakes  are  the  triggering  mechanism  for  most  tsunamis, 
NEHRP  activities  aimed  at  improving  seismic  monitoring  capabilities  are  directly 
relevant  to  improved  tsunami  warnings.  The  2000  reauthorization  of  NEHRP  au-
thorized  the  development  of  the  Advanced  National  Seismic  System  (ANSS).  The 
data  from  ANSS  stations  is  provided  to  the  NOAA  Tsunami  Warning  Centers.  In 
addition,  NSF’s  George  E.  Brown  Jr.  Network  for  Earthquake  Engineering  Simula-
tion  (NEES)  facility,  authorized  as  part  of  NEHRP  legislation,  includes  a  tsunami-
wave tank at Oregon State University that is making significant contribution to our 
understanding of tsunami phenomena. 

With  respect  to  the  second  part  of  this  question,  the  forces  generated  by  a  tsu-
nami  wave  are  different  from  those  generated  by  strong  seismic  shaking,  and  the 
building  design  for  the  earthquakes  does  not  necessarily  address  the  hydrodynamic 
forces  generated  by  tsunamis.  USGS  is  not  directly  involved  in  the  issuance  of 
model  building  codes,  although  USGS  data  provides  a  critical  input  to  the  process. 
This  question  would  be  best  directed  to  our  NEHRP  partner  agencies,  NIST  and 
FEMA.  FEMA  is  in  the  process  of  developing  model  tsunami  inundation  zone 
vertical  evacuation  shelter  construction  guidance  for  coastal  areas,  a  project  that 
was initiated before the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami brought this issue to the 
forefront.

Question 2. Does the Earthquake Program have any programs or approaches that 
should  be  adopted  by  the  Tsunami  program?  For  example,  should  we  expand  pro-
grams regarding construction and planning? 

Answer.  The  USGS  operates  seismic  networks  in  order  to  record  data  from  large 
earthquakes.  We  conduct  extensive  research  on  this  data  to  document  the  amount 
of  shaking  that  earthquakes  can  generate  and  to  predict  the  probability  of  strong 
shaking for the entire nation. This information is utilized by engineers to make im-
provements to the International Building Code so that structures can withstand the 
shaking from strong earthquakes. 

This  collaboration  between  engineering  seismologists  in  the  USGS  Earthquake 
Hazards  Program  and  the  engineers  who  are  responsible  for  modifications  of  the 
building  code  serves  as  a  model  for  developing  structures  that  could  withstand  the 
forces  of  a  tsunami.  Hydrodynamicists  can  study  and  model  these  forces  for  input 
to engineers developing building codes for inundation areas.

Question  3.  Has  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA)  partici-
pated  meaningfully  or  financially  in  either  program?  Are  there  limitations  that  we 
should know about? 

Answer. FEMA plays a crucial role in both programs, ensuring that fundamental 
and  applied  research  activities  are  implemented  into  loss-reduction  practice. 
FEMA’s  role  in  the  NTHMP  flexes  according  to  the  needs  of  the  five  Pacific  states. 
During  the  first  formative  years  of  the  program,  the  mitigation  budget  was  divided

between the five states and FEMA, with FEMA running a multi-state project. How-
ever, rather than transfer funds to FEMA for a multi-state project, a few years ago 
the  Steering  Committee  decided  to  support  these  projects  through  a  grant  directly 
to one of the states. Currently, the NTHMP is funding the Guidelines for Construc-
tion  in  Tsunami  Inundation  Zones,  a  multi-state  program  effort,  through  Wash-
ington State. FEMA Headquarters has contributed about $250K to match the fund-
ing from NTHMP for this effort.

Question  4.  How  can  we  improve  coordination  and  better  define  agency  roles  in 

our legislation? 

Answer. The NTHMP program has provided the impetus for interagency coordina-
tion and cooperation. Under guidance of a federal-state steering committee, the need 
for reducing the hazard of future tsunamis has been foremost in guiding cooperative 
efforts  by  NOAA,  FEMA,  and  USGS.  Continued  support  for  this  program,  with  a 
strong  interagency  steering  committee  and  active  interaction  at  the  working  level, 
is  in  the  best  interest  of  furthering  this  work.  No  single  federal  agency  has  the  re-
sources or mission to address this complex hazard. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARK PRYOR TO

CHARLES G. GROAT 

Voice Sirens for Effective, Reliable Tsunami Warning 

Effective tsunami warning should rely on a variety of redundant modes of commu-
nication. While there are several technologies for communicating tsunami warnings 
highlighted  in  the  Tsunami  Preparedness  Act  of  2005  (S.  50),  it  is  a  concern  that 
voice  capable  sirens  are  not  among  the  technologies  mentioned.  Emergency  man-
agers  have  long  depended  on  sirens  to  warn  the  public  of  emergency  and  civil  de-
fense  situations  including  tsunamis,  tornados,  floods,  hurricanes,  hazardous  mate-
rial accidents, and of a potential nuclear attack. 

Sirens have a number of significant advantages: they insure that all residents and 
visitors  to  a  particular  area  can  be  informed  without  regard  to  the  cell  phone  or 
pager  technology  platform  or  provider  they  may  have,  when  equipped  with  backup 
power  supplies  they  will  work  even  when  the  electricity  or  phone  lines  are  out; 
when  equipped  with  live  public  address  or  pre-recorded  messages  they  can  be  used 
BEFORE and AFTER the incident to communicate important public safety informa-
tion. 

Question  1.  Without  the  use  of/installation  of  voice  sirens  as  part  of  a  prepared-
ness plan, how do you warn people on the ground? Are there other effective warning 
systems available for this purpose? What criteria are used to determine which warn-
ing system is reliable in case of tsunami?

Question  2.  Should  a  preparedness  plan  include  a  warning  mechanism  for  small 
fishing  boats  trawling  near  the  coastline?  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Ad-
ministration  (NOAA)  weather  radios  can  be  used  to  inform  these  fishing  boats  at 
minimal cost (approximately $20). 

Answer. USGS will defer to NOAA’s responses to these questions.
