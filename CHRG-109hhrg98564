HEARING CHARTER

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

NASA’s Fiscal Year 2006

Budget Proposal

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 2005

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On  Thursday,  February  17th  at  10:00  a.m.,  the  Committee  on  Science  will  hold
a  hearing  on  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration’s  (NASA)  Fiscal
Year  (FY)  2006  budget  proposal.  The  hearing  will  examine  NASA’s  plans  and  pro-
grams and the rationale for the funding levels proposed in the agency’s budget.

In  January  2004,  the  President  announced  a  new  Vision  for  Space  Exploration.
The  President’s  plan  can  be  seen  as  having  three  distinct,  but  related  aspects.  The
first  aspect  concerns  current  human  space  flight  programs.  The  President  proposes
to complete construction of the International Space Station (ISS) by 2010 and to re-
tire  the  Space  Shuttle  at  that  point.  ISS  research  is  to  be  reconfigured  to  focus  on
questions related to the impact on human health of spending long periods in space.
Under  the  proposal,  the  U.S.  participation  in  ISS  is  slated  to  end  around  2016,  al-
though  the  Administration  has  said  that  that  date  may  shift.  NASA  has  also  de-
cided to cancel the Shuttle mission that was needed to keep the Hubble Space Tele-
scope in operation past 2007. Completing construction of the Space Station by 2010,
enabling the Shuttle to be retired that year, is necessary to free up the funds need-
ed to return to the Moon by 2020.

The second aspect of the Vision concerns new medium-term goals for human space
flight.  The  central  goal  is  to  return  humans  to  the  Moon  between  2015  and  2020.
To  do  this,  NASA  will  develop  a  new  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  (CEV),  which  will
be  tested  without  carrying  people  by  2008  and  will  carry  humans  into  space  by
2014.

The  third  aspect  of  the  Vision  concerns  long-range  goals  for  the  years  past  2020.
The  entire  plan  is  geared  toward  preparing  for  this  period,  but  what  will  happen
during  these  years  is  (perhaps  necessarily)  left  entirely  open-ended.  The  ultimate
goals are to send humans to Mars and ‘‘worlds beyond’’ and to increase the commer-
cial  exploitation  of  space.  The  timing  of  future  exploration  is  left  open  and  will  de-
pend  on  the  pace  of  technology  development  and  discovery  and  the  availability  of
funds.
Overarching Questions:

Questions about the budget proposal basically fall into three categories:

1. SHUTTLE  AND  STATION:  How  will  NASA  ensure  that  the  Shuttle  is  re-
tired  by  2010?  Will  that  require  scaling  back  the  Space  Station?  How  will
the Space Station contribute to Space Exploration?

2. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EXPLORATION VISION: When and how will
NASA  determine  the  specific  goals  for  the  CEV?  Will  the  development  costs
of the CEV stay within budget projections?

3. OVERALL  NASA  BUDGET:  To  what  extent  should  other  portions  of  the
NASA  budget  (Earth  Science,  Space  Science,  Aeronautics)  be  cut  to  free  up
funds for human space programs? What would the impact be of the proposed
cuts in these areas?

Witness:
Mr.  Frederick  D.  Gregory  is  the  NASA  Deputy  Administrator.  He  is  expected  to
be named Acting Administrator once the resignation of Sean O’Keefe is officially ef-
fective on Feb. 18.

Budget Highlights:

4

NASA’s  budget  request  for  FY06  is  $16.5  billion,  an  increase  of  2.4  percent  over
the  $16.1  billion  provided  in  FY05.  (The  FY05  level  does  not  include  the  $126  mil-
lion emergency supplemental provided to fix facilities damaged from last year’s hur-
ricanes.)  While  this  year’s  increase  for  NASA  is  larger  than  that  for  most  other
agencies,  NASA’s  overall  the  budget  is  $546  million  less  than  the  4.7  percent  by
which its budget was projected to grow in last year’s budget documents.

The  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  continues  to  be  the  priority  in  NASA’s  budget.
The Space Shuttle and Space Station continue to bulk large in the budget, together
accounting  for  39  percent  of  the  proposed  NASA  budget  for  FY06.  Development  of
the CEV would jump in the FY06 budget by more than 500 percent, from $140 mil-
lion in FY05 to $753 million in FY06, as work on the vehicle gets underway in ear-
nest to allow for an unmanned test in 2008. In general, no element of NASA’s budg-
et  related  to  exploration  is  proposed  for  a  cut  in  FY06  for  reasons  of  budget  strin-
gency,  although  a  few  areas  are  cut  either  because  new  cost  estimates  are  lower
than  previous  ‘‘placeholder’’  numbers  or  because  of  problems  with  specific  projects.
The  primary  example  of  the  latter  is  the  reduction  in  Project  Prometheus,  which  is
working  to  develop  nuclear  propulsion  techniques.  NASA  has  decided  not  to  move
ahead now with the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) as a first test of Project Pro-
metheus technology because it was proving to be too complex and expensive. NASA
is  reviewing  options  before  deciding  what  mission  to  substitute  for  JIMO  as  a  test.
Funding for research aboard the Space Station is proposed for a cut as NASA reori-
ents the program toward research on human physiology.

The  budget  does  propose  cuts  to  programs  that  are  not  related  to  the  Vision,  in-
cluding  Earth  Science,  Aeronautics  and  some  portions  of  Space  Science.  The  pro-
posed cuts in these areas along with a reassessment of NASA’s personnel needs for
exploration is leading NASA to consider reducing its workforce by as many as 2,000
people, through layoffs if necessary.

A  Senate-requested  study  by  the  Congressional  Budget  Office  last  year  deter-
mined  that  if  costs  for  the  Exploration  Vision  grew  at  the  same  pace  as  costs  for
previous  NASA  projects,  the  Vision  could  cost  as  much  as  $32  billion  to  $61  billion
more  than  has  been  estimated  by  2020.  CBO  did  not  assess  the  likelihood  of  such
an escalation occurring.

In  FY05,  as  part  of  the  Omnibus  Appropriations  Act,  Congress  provided  NASA
with its full funding request, an increase of more than five percent from FY04, and
gave  NASA  flexibility  in  allocating  the  money.  The  Appropriations  Act  did  seek  to
limit  spending  on  the  Lunar  Robotic  Orbiter,  scheduled  to  launch  in  2008,  but
NASA has chosen to provide full funding for the project. The Act also provided fund-
ing  for  a  robotic  servicing  mission  to  the  Hubble,  which  NASA  is  now  canceling.
Congress  has  not  yet  had  a  specific  vote  or  debate  on  the  President’s  Vision,  and
the  report  accompanying  the  Appropriations  Act  asked  for  numerous  reports  to  fill
in details about the Vision.
Issues:
When  will  the  Space  Shuttle  return  to  flight?  The  Shuttle  is  currently  slated
to return-to-flight in May or June of this year, after having been grounded for more
than two years since the Feb. 1, 2003 loss of the Columbia. NASA has been working
to  implement  the  recommendations  of  the  Columbia  Accident  Investigation  Board
(CAIB) and its efforts are being reviewed by a NASA-appointed group, the Stafford-
Covey  Task  Force.  The  Task  Force  has  determined  that,  so  far,  NASA  has  success-
fully  completed  work  on  six  of  the  CAIB’s  15  recommendations  for  returning  to
flight.  NASA  officials  and  the  Task  Force  appear  cautiously  optimistic  that  NASA
will be able to stick to the May-June schedule even though NASA will probably not
have developed a repair capability for the Shuttle’s tiles by then. NASA officials and
Task  Force  members  have  expressed  concern,  however,  that  NASA  could  learn  of
problems  during  a  successful  first  flight  that  could  complicate  future  launches.  The
Shuttle  will  be  under  intense  scrutiny  during  that  flight,  and  since  the  Columbia
disaster  NASA  engineers  have  learned  of  more  aspects  of  Shuttle  flights  that  need
to  be  monitored  (like  the  foam  shedding  that  brought  down  the  Columbia)  because
they  could  imperil  the  vehicle.  NASA  estimates  that  returning  the  Shuttle  to  flight
will cost about $762 million more in FY05 than had been requested originally.
How many more Shuttle flights are needed to complete the Space Station?
NASA has flown 16 Shuttle missions to the ISS so far and currently estimates that
another  28  are  needed  to  complete  its  construction.  Doubts  have  been  raised  inside
and  outside  NASA  that  28  flights  could  be  competed  in  time  to  retire  the  Shuttle
by  2010.  As  a  result,  NASA  is  in  the  process  of  reviewing  its  options  to  reduce  the
number of flights (see more below), including by scaling back the Space Station and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

5

by  using  other  vehicles  for  logistic  and  crew  missions  for  which  the  Shuttle  is  not
required. NASA officials have suggested that the number of flights could be reduced
to 23 and perhaps to as few as 16 with changes to the Space Station. Also, the Shut-
tle  is  required  to  ferry  large  replacement  parts  to  the  Station,  such  as  gyroscopes,
as  they  wear  out.  If  the  Station  is  to  remain  in  use  until  around  2016,  the  Shuttle
will  have  to  launch  and  pre-position  in  space,  large  replacement  parts  before  the
Shuttle is retired.
What  is  the  future  of  the  Space  Station,  and  how  will  it  contribute  to  the
program to go to the Moon and Mars? The President’s Vision called for research
on  the  Space  Station  to  be  reoriented  from  a  range  of  biological  and  physical  re-
search  projects  to  a  narrower,  more  focused  agenda  researching  matters  necessary
to  keep  humans  alive  and  healthy  during  long  stays  in  space.  NASA  now  expects
to  have  a  review  completed  by  the  end  of  this  month  of  how  the  Station  could  con-
tribute  to  space  exploration.  The  two  greatest  human  health  issues  involve  the  ef-
fects  of  low  gravity  and  the  effects  of  radiation.  Radiation  research  is  better  con-
ducted  on  Earth  than  on  the  ISS,  and  NASA  has  a  facility  for  that  purpose  at  the
Brookhaven  National  Laboratory  in  New  York.  The  question  then  is  what  kinds  of
research can be done on the Station to learn how to mitigate the effects on the body
of  low  gravity  and  whether  that  research  can  be  conducted  only  on  the  Station.  A
related  question  is  whether  enough  astronauts  can  serve  on  the  ISS  long  enough
for statistically sound conclusions to be reached before the Station is retired. NASA
is  seriously  considering  scaling  back  the  Station  to  eliminate  projects  that  may  not
be  required  to  understand  how  astronauts  could  spend  long  periods  on  the  Moon.
NASA  may  cancel  the  centrifuge  being  built  for  the  U.S.  by  the  Japanese  that  was
to study the effects on animals of low gravity. While in the past, the centrifuge was
described  as  perhaps  the  most  useful  piece  of  scientific  equipment  designed  for  the
Station,  NASA  is  now  beginning  to  argue  that  it  needs  human  rather  than  animal
research  and  that  the  centrifuge  research  is  more  relevant  to  a  Mars  mission  than
to  a  lunar  one.  Once  NASA  determines  how  it  will  use  the  Station,  it  will  then  de-
termine how many Shuttle flights will be needed to complete the Station and when
they will be needed. That review is expected to be completed late this spring.
Will  Americans  still  be  able  to  use  the  Space  Station  effectively  after  next
April  when  our  agreement  with  the  Russians  expires?  NASA  faces  a  legal
hurdle  next  year  that  could  prevent  any  effective  utilization  of  the  Space  Station
after  next  April.  The  U.S.  is  dependent  on  the  Russians  for  crew  rescue  capability,
which is provided by Russian Soyuz vehicles. The Shuttle is not capable of remain-
ing  docked  at  the  Station  for  long  enough  stays  to  provide  this  service,  and  U.S.
regulations  prevent  astronauts  from  being  aboard  the  Station  if  there  is  no  rescue
capability.  But  under  the  Iran  Nonproliferation  Act  (INA),  the  U.S.  is  forbidden  to
provide the Russians with cash or services under a new agreement unless the Presi-
dent certifies that the Russians are not proliferating nuclear technology from Iran—
a  certification  the  President  is  highly  unlikely  to  make.  NASA  has  no  known  alter-
native plans for providing a crew rescue capability beyond buying such services from
the Russians. The matter is currently the subject of an interagency review, and the
Administration  is  expected  to  send  up  an  amendment  to  the  INA,  perhaps  as  early
as next month. It is unclear how Congress would react to such a proposal with Iran
being  such  a  focus  of  attention  in  foreign  policy.  The  International  Relations  Com-
mittee, which shares jurisdiction with the Science Committee over the Act, has been
a  strong  proponent  of  the  Act.  If  Congress  fails  to  amend  the  INA,  the  U.S.  would
not  be  able  to  use  the  Soyuz  as  a  rescue  vehicle  or  to  use  Russian  Soyuz  and
Progress  vehicles  to  ferry  astronauts  and  cargo,  respectively,  to  and  from  the  Sta-
tion to limit the use of the Shuttle.
Will the Space Station program exceed the Congressional cost cap? Another
legal hurdle facing the ISS program is the $25 billion cost cap for ISS development
set  by  Congress.  (The  cap  only  applies  to  ISS  development  costs  and  does  not  in-
clude costs for operations, Shuttle, and research.) The original cost estimate for ISS
development  in  1993  was  $17.4  billion.  In  1998,  NASA  announced  an  increase  to
$21.3  billion.  As  a  result,  NASA  asked  an  outside  task  force  to  evaluate  the  cost
and  schedule  credibility  of  the  ISS  program.  The  task  force  estimated  the  develop-
ment cost of the ISS, given the configuration at the time, at $24.7 billion. Congress
then  set  a  $25  billion  cost  cap  on  the  ISS  in  the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2000
(P.L.  106–391).  According  to  NASA’s  FY06  budget  request,  the  ISS  will  exceed  the
Congressional cost cap in FY05. NASA is likely to request legislative relief from the
existing cost cap.
How  is  NASA  proceeding  with  development  of  the  CEV?  NASA  intends  to
issue  a  Request  for  Proposals  for  companies  interested  in  developing  the  CEV  in

March. Then toward the end of FY05, NASA intends to select two teams to prepare
prototypes of a CEV. As a result, large-scale spending on the CEV is slated to begin
in  FY06.  NASA  has  described  its  budget  request  for  CEV  for  FY06  as  something
of  a  ‘‘placeholder’’  because  no  contract  has  yet  been  let.  NASA  has  estimated  total
development  costs  for  the  vehicle  at  about  $15  billion.  NASA  is  moving  ahead  with
contractor  awards  without  settling  many  of  the  questions  concerning  the  vehicle,
and, indeed, will leave some of these questions to two contractor teams that will de-
sign  the  vehicle.  Among  the  key  open  questions  are  whether  the  CEV  will  be  able
to  dock  with  or  service  the  Space  Station  and  the  number  of  crew  members  it  will
be able to carry. Relatedly, NASA has not yet decided what astronauts will do once
they get to the Moon. Some of those decisions will have to await the data gathered
by  the  Lunar  Robotic  Orbiter,  due  to  be  launched  in  2008,  which  will  gather  data
on potentially landing sites and the availability of resources on the Moon, including
water.
What launch vehicle will the CEV will require? NASA has also not yet decided
what vehicle to use to launch the CEV. It could choose to launch the CEV into space
on  top  of  an  expendable  rocket  like  the  Defense  Department  uses  to  launch  sat-
ellites, although alterations might need to be made to such a rocket for it to be con-
sidered  sufficiently  safe  for  human  launches.  Or  NASA  may  choose  to  develop  a
launch vehicle based on the components of the Space Shuttle. Alternatively, it may
choose to develop an entirely new vehicle, although that would probably increase the
costs for the Vision beyond current estimates.

NASA  must  make  a  decision  soon,  especially  if  the  agency  chooses  a  Shuttle-de-
rived design, because it must work to keep open production lines for Shuttle compo-
nents  beyond  the  point  when  they  would  otherwise  be  needed.  The  President’s  re-
cently  released  Space  Transportation  Policy  directs  that  NASA’s  decision  be  made
jointly  with  the  Department  of  Defense.  NASA  anticipates  that  it  will  conclude  its
study of launch vehicle options and submit its decision for interagency review some-
time in the next few months.
How will the Vision affect NASA’s science and aeronautics programs? NASA
considers  planetary  science  (such  as  robotic  missions  to  Mars)  as  part  of  the  explo-
ration program. But other areas of Space Science, such as those more related to as-
trophysics, and all of Earth Science are not considered NASA priorities in the FY06
budget, although they continue to receive significant funding. The proposed changes
in these areas are highlighted in the budget details in the next section of this char-
ter. The FY06 budget calls for a significant paring back of aeronautics research, re-
focusing the program, and reducing funding to $850 million, down $250 million from
FY04.  NASA  has  requested  adequate  funding  to  preserve  the  launch  date  of  2011
for the James Webb Telescope, the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope.
What is the future of the Hubble Space Telescope? The  budget  request,  in  ef-
fect,  allows  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  to  die,  as  funding  is  included  only  to  con-
tinue  work  on  a  de-orbiting  mission;  no  funds  are  included  for  servicing.  The  Com-
mittee recently held a hearing to examine the options for the Hubble, of which there
are basically four, each of which arguably cost in the range of $2 billion:

• Do not service the telescope. The telescope will then cease to function as early
as  2007.  NASA  does  have  other  space  telescopes  in  orbit  and  others  are
planned  to  be  launched  in  2011,  but  none  has  the  same  capabilities  as
Hubble.

• Send  the  Shuttle  to  service  the  telescope.  This  is  the  recommendation  of  the
National  Academy  of  Sciences.  Like  any  Shuttle  mission,  this  would  put  as-
tronauts at risk. It would also delay completion of the ISS.

• Send  a  robotic  mission  to  service  the  telescope.  There  is  wide  disagreement
as  to  whether  this  mission  could  be  ready  in  time.  The  National  Academy  of
Science concluded it could not, but those involved in the robotic effort believe
it can be done in time.

• Launch  a  new  ‘‘platform’’  with  the  equipment  that  was  designed  to  be  added
to the Hubble (this is sometimes called ‘‘rehosting’’) and perhaps include new
equipment as well. This would leave a gap in Hubble science, as the new plat-
form  would  probably  not  be  ready  until  after  the  Hubble  stopped  operating.

Details of NASA’s FY06 Budget:

7

Space Operations

The primary programs within Space Operations are the ISS and the Space Shut-
tle, which together make up almost 40 percent of NASA’s budget. The FY06 budget
request  for  ISS  and  Space  Shuttle  totals  $6.4  billion,  up  $169  from  FY05  and  $945
million from FY04.

Funding  for  the  Shuttle  would  decline  from  nearly  $5  billion  in  FY05  to  $4.5  bil-
lion in FY06 as NASA finishes paying for the increased costs associated with return-
ing  the  Shuttles  to  flight.  NASA  says  that  it  will  not  know  whether  it  will  need  to
make  adjustments  to  its  FY06  request  for  Shuttle  until  after  the  Shuttle  returns
to flight and the agency can assess whether additional work must be done to ensure
the  vehicles’  safety.  Also,  NASA  has  indicated  that  the  funding  levels  proposed  for
the  years  beyond  FY06  (see  attached  table)  are  ballpark  estimates  and  could  rise
as  NASA  develops  a  better  understanding  of  the  costs  associated  with  retiring  the
Shuttle.

The  large  increases  in  the  Shuttle  program  from  FY04  to  FY05  were  due  to  the
escalating costs of returning the Shuttles to flight, expected this spring. The current
launch window for return-to-flight is May 12th through June 3rd.
Exploration Systems

Funding  for  Exploration  Systems—which  includes  funding  for  the  human  Moon
mission,  including  the  CEV,  and  for  the  development  of  nuclear  reactors  for  use  in
space  and  on  other  planets—would  grow  by  nearly  half  a  billion  dollars  from  FY05
to $3.165 billion under the request. The CEV would grow from $140 million in FY05
to  $753  million  in  FY06.  Meanwhile  Prometheus,  NASA’s  nuclear  reactor  program,
would be cut from $432 million in FY05 to $320 million in FY06.

The Administration has described its FY06 request for the CEV program as some-
thing  of  a  ‘‘placeholder’’  while  the  program  continues  to  be  defined.  The  funding
level  requested  for  Prometheus  is  a  placeholder,  as  well,  as  NASA  recently  an-
nounced  that  it  was  scrapping  its  plan  to  send  a  nuclear-powered  robotic  mission
to Jupiter’s icy moons (an orbiter known as JIMO) and is instead conducting a com-
plete  review  of  its  nuclear  program.  The  agency  says  that  the  analysis  will  help  it
to  determine  how  Prometheus  might  fit  into  the  Vision  and  what  kind  of  mission
might provide the best opportunity to demonstrate its capabilities. In the meantime,
JIMO  is  on  hold,  sidelining  a  mission  that  included  investigations  of  the  Jovian
moon Europa, the number one priority among scientists, according to the latest Na-
tional Academy of Sciences decadal survey of astronomy priorities.

The  budget  requests  $34  million  for  NASA’s  prize  program,  called  Centennial
Challenges, up from $9.7 million appropriated for FY05. NASA needs authorization
from Congress to move forward with prizes greater than $250,000.

NASA proposes to shift into the Exploration Systems account what was previously
the  Biological  and  Physical  Research  (BPR)  program,  now  called  Human  Systems
Research and Technology. The program funds research aboard the ISS. The program
has been restructured numerous times over the past several years. The budget pro-
poses  a  $198  million  or  20  percent  decrease  from  FY05  levels  to  $806  million  as
NASA determines the future of the program.
Science

Funding for Earth and Space Science programs, which NASA proposes to combine
into a single Science account for FY06, is only slightly down from FY05, but several
hundred  million  below  the  level  NASA  projected  last  year  that  it  would  need.  To
accommodate the addition last year of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) mis-
sion,  which  will  orbit  the  Moon  to  gather  data  in  advance  of  a  human  mission,  a
number  of  Space  Science  and  Earth  science  programs  have  been  delayed  or  cut.  As
the  LRO  mission  ramps  up  the  amount  of  funding  required,  it  is  expected  to  have
a  larger  effect  on  other  space  and  Earth  science  missions  unless  the  overall  level
of funding for science grows accordingly.

Last year, NASA announced that it would delay the launch of the Joint Dark En-
ergy  Mission  (JDEM),  a  mission  NASA  had  planned  to  carry  out  together  with  the
Department  of  Energy  to  explore  the  nature  of  dark  energy.  Scientists  believe  that
understanding  dark  energy  has  the  potential  to  fundamentally  alter  our  under-
standing of the universe.

The following are changes NASA proposes to make in this year’s budget:

• Cut  to  Earth  Science:  The  budget  cuts  the  Earth  Systematic  Missions  pro-
gram by $118 million, or 40 percent below FY05. As a result, NASA proposes
essentially to cancel the Glory mission, which the Administration believes will
answer  critical  questions  about  climate  change.  While  the  budget  continues
the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, it is not clear whether
enough  funds  are  provided  in  FY06  to  allow  for  the  planned  2010  launch.
Earth scientists have called GPM one of their top priorities for understanding
severe weather events such as hurricanes.

Also,  a  mission  designed  to  ensure  that  weather  instruments  are  properly
tested  before  they  are  launched  on  the  Nation’s  next  generation  of  weather
satellites  is  running  into  problems  and  will  be  delayed  if  it  does  not  receive
additional funding.

• Addition  to  Earth  Science:  The  budget  increases  funds  for  Earth  System
Science Pathfinder projects by $27 million, or 25 percent over FY05. However,
the  budget  documents  NASA  has  provided  do  not  contain  sufficient  detail  to
determine which programs will benefit from the increase.

• Change  to  Space  Science:  The  proposed  budget  provides  $371  million  for  the
James Webb Space Telescope. NASA continues to hold to a launch date of the
Webb  to  2011.  The  budget  for  Webb  is  an  increase  of  $60  million  over  the
FY05  level,  but  a  $23  million  decrease  from  the  level  projected  for  FY06  last
year.  It  is  unclear  why  NASA  now  believes  the  Webb  Telescope  needs  less
than it had previously projected.

• Cut to Space Science: The budget proposes slipping the Space Interferometer
Mission (SIM) by two years with launch now scheduled for 2012. SIM will de-
tect Earth-like planets.

• Cut  to  Space  Science:  The  Future  New  Frontiers  program  is  cut  by  $56  mil-
lion  from  FY05.  The  budget  cut  will  delay  selection  of  the  second  New  Fron-
tiers  mission.  The  first  mission,  called  New  Horizons,  a  mission  to  Pluto,  is
scheduled to be launched next year.

Aeronautics Research

The budget request for Aeronautics is $852 million, a decrease of $54 million from
FY05 and $182 million below the FY04 level of $1.034 billion. The Aeronautics pro-
gram  has  three  main  components,  Aviation  Safety  and  Security,  Airspace  Systems,
and Vehicle systems. NASA proposes to limit research within Vehicle Systems to ac-
tivities related to noise and emissions reductions, and unmanned aerial vehicles. Ve-
hicle  Systems  is  a  big  user  of  wind  tunnels,  and  maintaining  these  facilities  puts
significant  pressure  on  the  budget.  NASA  is  proposing  to  restructure  its  research
programs to focus on those that do not depend as heavily on wind tunnel tests.

Education Programs

NASA  proposes  $167  million  for  its  education  programs,  $2  million  less  than
FY05,  or  a  one  percent  cut.  NASA’s  FY06  budget  run-out  projects  that  education
will  get  cut  again  in  FY07,  bringing  it  down  to  $155  million  where  it  will  remain
at that level through 2010.
Other Issues:
Financial Management Issues at NASA

In  three  of  the  past  four  years,  NASA  has  not  been  able  to  produce  auditable  fi-
nancial  statements;  its  financial  auditors  disclaimed  opinions  on  NASA’s  financial
statements for fiscal years 2001, 2003, and 2004. NASA’s new auditors for FY 2004,
Ernst  &  Young,  reported  that  many  financial  management  weaknesses  continue  to
persist, including the following:

• NASA has not been able to reconcile its Fund Balance with Treasury account
since  FY  2003.  Although  NASA  reportedly  has  resolved  many  of  the  errors
causing  a  difference  of  almost  $2  billion  as  of  September  30,  2003,  Ernst  &
Young  identified  unreconciled  differences  between  NASA  and  Treasury  of
$313 million as of September 30, 2004.

• NASA  lacks  adequate  controls  to  ensure  that  its  Property,  Plant,  and  Equip-
ment  and  Materials  and  Supplies  are  properly  valued  and  accounted  for.  As
of  the  end  of  FY  2004,  NASA  reported  the  value  of  these  assets  as  $37.6  bil-
lion.

• NASA  lacks  an  integrated  financial  management  system,  as  required  by  the

Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996.

In April 2000, NASA began development of its Integrated Financial Management
Program (IFMP), consisting of nine systems or modules to support a range of activi-
ties,  including  accounting,  asset  management,  contract  administration,  and  human
resource  management.  The  Core  Financial  module,  considered  the  backbone  of
IFMP,  was  implemented  in  2003.  However,  the  Government  Accountability  Office
(GAO) reported that NASA did not follow disciplined processes in implementing this
module and as a result, NASA has been experiencing numerous data integrity prob-
lems  with  the  system.  Ernst  &  Young  recently  reported  that  the  Core  Financial
module  is  not  integrated  with  certain  subsidiary  systems,  does  not  facilitate  the
preparation  of  financial  statements,  and  does  not  contain  sufficient  controls  to  de-
tect and correct invalid data in a timely fashion. According to NASA, problems with
the  Core  Financial  module  are  the  cause  of  $565  billion  in  adjustments  needed  to
complete its FY 2004 financial statements.

NASA  plans  to  complete  implementation  of  all  nine  IFMP  modules  by  FY07.
While NASA has estimated the life cycle cost of IFMP to be almost $1 billion, GAO
found that this estimate does not include all costs.
Workforce

To  support  the  Vision,  NASA  has  said  that  it  needs  to  ‘‘transform’’  its  workforce
into a smaller force with a different set of skills than those possessed by its current
employees.  Overall,  the  agency  aims  to  reduce  its  total  workforce  from  19,227  full-
time employees in FY05 to 18,798 in FY06, a net reduction of 429 employees.

The  total  additions  and  reductions  in  staff  are  likely  to  be  greater,  however,  as
NASA  has  determined  that  about  2,000  of  its  employees  have  skills  that  are  not
well  matched  to  the  skills  the  agency  now  believes  it  needs.  NASA  believes  that  it
simply  no  longer  needs  the  skills  of  about  1,000  of  these  employees,  many  of  them
technicians that work in with aeronautics research facilities. NASA has offered vol-
untary  buy-outs  to  these  employees,  but  as  of  January  12,  only  302  employees  had
accepted  them.  As  of  February  7,  NASA  has  given  its  center  directors  approval  to
begin  talking  about  the  potential  for  positions  to  be  eliminated  and  the  news  has
been covered widely in media reports, so the number of employees taking voluntary
buy-outs may increase.

NASA  believes  the  other  1,000  employees  might  be  able  to  compete  for  future
projects  and  thus  retain  their  jobs,  but  that  outcome  is  uncertain  and  it  is  possible
that  the  agency  would  eventually  resort  to  mandatory  Reductions  In  Force  (RIFs)
to accomplish its workforce goals.

Chairman BOEHLERT. We have a crisis. Someone stole the Chair-
man’s gavel. As a strong advocate of clean water, I will gavel this.
This hearing will come to order.

I  want  to  welcome  everyone  here  this  morning  to  this  important
hearing  on  the  NASA  budget.  I  see  this  hearing  as  the  first  in  a
series that will culminate in the introduction of a NASA authoriza-
tion  bill.  Our  goal  is  to  get  such  a  bill  to  the  House  Floor  in  time
to  influence  the  appropriations  process.  I  know  that  is  Chairman
Calvert’s goal as well, and I want to welcome him to his important
responsibilities  as  Chairman  of  the  Subcommittee.  Last  year,  we
were  deeply  engaged  in  that  process  behind  the  scenes.  Now,  we
should be ready to go more public.

I  want  to  do  an  authorization  bill,  because  I  think  it  is  critical
that  Congress  have  a  full  and  open  debate  on  the  President’s  Vi-
sion  for  Space  Exploration  and  the  future  of  NASA,  before  NASA
barrels  ahead  with  the  program.  Congress  has  never  endorsed,  in
fact  has  never  discussed  the  vision.  What  we  did  do,  as  part  of  a
huge  omnibus  bill,  is  provide  the  money  to  enable  NASA  to  con-
tinue  planning  how  it  wants  to  go  forward,  but  the  truly  critical
spending  commitments  start  in  fiscal  year  2006,  so  this  year  is
when we must have the debate.

Here  are  some  of  my  current  thoughts  on  how  I  would  like  that
debate  to  come  out.  First,  let  me  state  clearly  some  things  that  I
am for.

I am for returning humans to the Moon by 2020. I am for moving
ahead prudently but swiftly with the development of a crew explo-
ration vehicle for that purpose. I am for retiring the Space Shuttle
as  soon  as  possible,  but  under  absolutely  no  circumstances  later
than December 31, 2010. That is, incidentally, compatible with the
Administration’s  position.  I  am  for  a  NASA  that  sees  itself  as  a
science  agency  with  all  of  space  science,  Earth  science,  and  aero-
nautics  receiving  the  attention  and  funding  according  to  priority
areas. I am for a NASA that is open to outside ideas from academia
and the private sector.

So  where  does  that  leave  me  on  the  current  budget  proposal?
With the same mixed feelings I have had in the past. First, let me
be blunt. I don’t think NASA should be our top budget priority, ei-
ther in this committee or in this Congress. That means in a budget
as excruciating tight as this one, NASA probably should not get as
much  as  the  President  has  proposed.  Moreover,  even  if  NASA  re-
ceived every cent it has requested, it would still be trying to do too
much  at  once,  the  historic  pattern  for  the  agency,  as  the  Gehman
Report  noted.  So  something  has  to  give,  and  this  hearing  will  be
a first step in looking at what that might be.

There is one other problem we have reviewing this budget. There
are  a  lot  of  fundamental  questions  that  NASA  still  isn’t  ready  to
answer. That is not a criticism of the agency. That is just a descrip-
tion  of  where  they  are  in  the  planning  process,  and  we  have  to
keep that in mind.

What  are  some  examples?  They  can’t  tell  us  what  research  will
be  done  aboard  the  Station.  They  can’t  tell  us  how  many  more
Shuttle  flights  will  be  scheduled.  They  can’t  tell  us  how  they  are
going  to  get  around  the  Iran  Non-Proliferation  Act.  They  can’t  tell
us  how  many  people  the  CEV  will  carry  or  whether  it  will  go  to

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

12

the  Space  Station.  They  can’t  tell  us  what  we  might  do  when  we
go to the Moon. And they obviously can’t tell us whether the Shut-
tle will once again fly successfully.

Again,  that  is  not  because  NASA  hasn’t  been  forthcoming.  Quite
the  contrary.  Top  NASA  officials  have  spent  countless  hours  with
us,  giving  direct  and  candid  answers  to  a  wide  range  of  questions.
But  they  can’t  provide  answers  that  they  don’t  yet  have,  and  we
need  to  understand  just  how  much  is  unknown,  the  extent,  for  ex-
ample,  the  cost—that  cost  estimates  for  the  CEV  and  Project  Pro-
metheus are still ‘‘placeholders.’’

So one thing I will be asking today is when some of our questions

might be answered.

I  know  some  answers  should  be  forthcoming  soon.  We  under-
stand,  for  example,  that  the  Administration  could  send  up  in  the
next month or so proposed to language to amend the Iran Non-Pro-
liferation  Act.  That  is  a  critical  matter,  because  the  current  law
would  bring  the  Station  program  to  a  halt  by  next  April.  Any  pro-
posal will be reviewed very carefully. The only thing I can say now,
and  I  think  the  Administration  agrees  with  this,  is  the  Station  is
a  lot  less  important  than  non-proliferation  is.  I  am  not  interested
in having go into space because we’ve blown ourselves up.

Well,  with  so  many  questions,  let  me  just  stop  there.  We  have
before  us  Fred  Gregory,  the  Deputy  Administrator  of  NASA,  who
has been an integral part of all the decision-making that went into
the  ’06  proposal.  The  agency  will  be  in  good  hands  as  he  becomes
Acting  Administrator  this  weekend.  But  I  am  sure  that  he  is  as
eager  as  anyone  in  this  town  to  see  an  end  to  the  parlor  game  or
predicting  who  will  be  appointed  when  to  succeed  Sean  O’Keefe.
But I am as helpless as he is in bringing that about.

Sean O’Keefe left the agency far stronger than he found it. Now,
we  need  to  decide  what  the  next  step  is  in  creating  a  strong  and
productive NASA.

Mr. Gordon.
[The prepared statement of Chairman Boehlert follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN SHERWOOD L. BOEHLERT

I  want  to  welcome  everyone  here  this  morning  to  this  important  hearing  on  the
NASA  budget.  I  see  this  hearing  as  the  first  in  a  series  that  will  culminate  in  the
introduction of a NASA authorization bill. Our goal is to get such a bill to the House
Floor in time to influence the appropriations process. I know that is Chairman Cal-
vert’s  goal  as  well.  Last  year,  we  were  deeply  engaged  in  that  process  behind  the
scenes; now we should be ready for a public role.

I want to do an authorization bill because I think it’s critical that Congress have
a  full  and  open  debate  on  the  President’s  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  and  the  fu-
ture of NASA before NASA barrels ahead with the program. Congress has never en-
dorsed—in fact, has never discussed—the Vision. What we did do, as part of a huge
Omnibus  bill,  is  provide  the  money  to  enable  NASA  to  continue  planning  how  it
wants to go forward. But the truly critical spending commitments start in FY06, so
this year is when we must have the debate.

Here are some of my current thoughts about how I’d like that debate to come out.

First, let me state clearly some things that I am for.

I am for returning humans to the Moon by 2020. I am for moving ahead prudently
but swiftly with the development of a Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) for that pur-
pose.  I  am  for  retiring  the  Space  Shuttle  as  soon  as  possible,  but  under  absolutely

as a science agency, with all of Space Science, Earth Science and Aeronautics receiv-
ing  the  attention  and  funding  accorded  to  priority  areas.  I  am  for  a  NASA  that  is
open to outside ideas from academia and the private sector.

They can’t tell us how many people the CEV will carry or whether it will go to the
Space Station. They can’t tell us what we might do when we get to the Moon. They
obviously can’t tell us whether the Shuttle will once again fly successfully.

Again, this is not because NASA hasn’t been forthcoming. Quite the contrary. Top
NASA  officials  have  spent  countless  hours  with  our  staff,  giving  direct  and  candid
answers to a wide range of questions. But they can’t provide answers that they don’t
yet  have.  And  we  need  to  understand  just  how  much  is  unknown—the  extent,  for
example,  that  cost  estimates  for  the  CEV  and  Project  Prometheus  are  still  (quote)
‘‘placeholders.’’

So,  one  thing  I’ll  be  asking  today  is  when  some  of  our  questions  might  be  an-

swered.

I  know  some  answers  should  be  forthcoming  soon.  We  understand,  for  example,
that  the  Administration  could  send  up  in  the  next  month  or  so  proposed  language
to amend the Iran Nonproliferation Act. That’s a critical matter because the current
law  would  bring  the  Station  program  to  a  halt  by  next  April.  Any  proposal  will  be
reviewed  carefully.  The  only  thing  I  can  say  now—and  I  think  the  Administration
agrees  with  this—is  that  the  Station  is  a  lot  less  important  than  non-proliferation
is. I’m not interested in having go into space because we’ve blown ourselves up.

Well, with so many questions pending, let me stop there. We have before us Fred
Gregory,  the  deputy  administrator  of  NASA,  who  has  been  an  integral  part  of  all
the  decision-making  that  went  into  the  FY06  proposal.  The  Agency  will  be  in  good
hands  as  he  becomes  acting  Administrator  this  weekend.  But  I  am  sure  that  he  is
as  eager  as  anyone  in  this  town  to  see  and  end  to  the  parlor  game  of  predicting
who  will  be  appointed  when  to  succeed  Sean  O’Keefe.  But  I’m  as  helpless  as  he  is
in bringing that about.

Sean  left  the  Agency  far  stronger  than  he  found  it.  Now  we  need  to  decide  what

the next steps in creating a strong and productive NASA should be.

Mr. Gordon.
Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to join you
in  welcoming  Mr.  Gregory  to  today’s  hearing,  and  I  want  to  sin-
cerely  thank  him  for  his  long  service  to  our  country  and  to  NASA,
and  to  say  I  am  very  pleased  that  you  are  going  to  top  this  off  by
not  just  being  interim,  but  the  Acting  Director  for  NASA.  I  think
it is a position well deserved.

You  know,  I  feel  a  little  embarrassed  that  I  continually  agree
with  the  Chairman.  The  Committee—the  Ranking  Member  is  sup-
posed to be raising some Cain here, but I think that our Chairman
very well has stated what I think is the right view of our position,
and  looking  at  NASA  now,  I  am  very  pleased  that  we  are  going  to
go  forward  with  additional  hearings,  and  have  an  authorization.  I
would  have  to  say  I  disagree  on  the  importance  of  NASA’s  budget.
I  would  like  to  see  that  number  not  only  stay  where  it  is,  but  be
increased.  But  again,  I  want  to  concur  with  the  very  good  state-
ment of our Chairman.

I would also like to take a moment to acknowledge and welcome
all of the new members of the Committee on both sides of the aisle,
as well as to extend my good wishes to Representative Calvert and

Representative  Udall,  as  they  embark  on  their  responsibilities  as
chair  and  Ranking  Member  of  the  Space  and  Aeronautics  Sub-
committee.  In  those  capacities,  they  will  be  leading  the  NASA-re-
lated  issues  on  a  regular  basis,  and  I  have  no  doubt  they  will  do
a good job.

Mr. Chairman, today’s hearing is likely to be one of the most im-
portant that we hold this session. More than a year ago has now—
or  more  than  a  year  has  now  passed  since  President  Bush  an-
nounced  his  Space  Exploration  Initiative.  I  for  one  support  the
President’s  proposal,  but  it  needs  to  be  paid  for  and  sustainable.
However,  since  the  time  the  initiative  was  first  announced,  there
has  been  little  opportunity  for  Congressional  scrutiny,  and  there
has  been  no  opportunity  to  develop  a  consensus  on  what  Congress
or  the  American  people  thinks  of  this  initiative,  which  is  very  im-
portant if this Committee is to successfully convince our colleagues
to continue its funding for several years during tight budgets.

And while some have argued that the funding provided to NASA
in  Fiscal  year  2005  omnibus  appropriations  constituted  a  Congres-
sional mandate for the President’s initiative, others would disagree.
In  point  of  fact,  Congress  was  being  asked  to  vote  up  or  down  on
a  $388  billion  spending  bill,  funding  a  wide  array  of  agencies  and
activities,  with  no  opportunity  for  amendments.  NASA’s  funding
accounted for only four percent of the total funding of that bill, and
despite the fact that NASA received close to its fiscal year 2005 re-
quest level, $1.5 billion of funds provided to NASA in the omnibus
are  going  to  be  needed  to  pay  for  things  like  the  increase  in  the
Shuttle return-to-flight costs that weren’t in the original fiscal year
2005 request.

So it appears that we are entering this year with Congress’ posi-
tion  on  the  Exploration  Initiative  still  unresolved.  It  also  appears
that Congress is going to have to address some fundamental issues
as  we  assist  the  President—assess  the  President’s  proposal,  nota-
bly,  what  priority  should  the  President’s  Exploration  Initiative
have,  relative  to  NASA’s  other  important  missions?  Are  we  pre-
pared  to  maintain  the  funding  and  the  schedule  of  the  President’s
initiative, even if it results in the loss of opportunities in space and
Earth science, and aeronautics research, and microgravity research
and  applications,  in  research  into  low-cost  and  high  reliability
launch  capacities  and  technologies,  or  in  other  significant  research
areas?

What role do we want NASA centers to play in the future? What
type of workforce do we envision for NASA? In that regard, are we
prepared  to  shed  highly  skilled  scientists,  engineers,  and  techni-
cians from NASA’s workforce if they do not directly support the re-
quirements  of  the  President’s  initiative?  These  are  not  idle  ques-
tions. They go to the heart of what we want from our nation’s civil
space  and  aeronautics  program.  Moreover,  I  do  not  believe  that
Congress  has  the  luxury  of  deferring  considerations  of  these  ques-
tions  any  longer.  One  thing  is  clear  from  NASA’s  fiscal  year  2006
budget request and from recent actions taken by the agency. In the
absence  of  any  clear  Congressional  direction,  NASA  is  proceeding
to move out aggressively to implement the President’s initiative. As
a  result,  we  are  starting  to  get  a  clear  picture  of  the  Administra-
tion’s  vision  for  NASA.  For  example,  just  one  year  after  President

Bush launched his space initiative, the Administration has already
started  backpedaling  on  multi-year  funding  profile  it  had  proposed
for  the  agency.  As  a  result,  the  Administration  is  planning  to  cut
a  total  of  some  $2.5  billion  from  the  budget  plan  for  fiscal  year
2006  through  fiscal  year  2009  that  had  been  proposed  for  NASA
just a year ago.

It  is  also  instructive  to  see  how  NASA  proposes  to  allocate  the
cut.  It  allocates  75  percent  of  the  required  cuts  to  NASA’s  science
and  aeronautics  program,  with  just  10  percent  having  to  be  ab-
sorbed by NASA’s exploration systems programs. What other clues
do  NASA’s  new  priorities—are  displayed  in  this  year’s  budget  re-
quest?  As  we  have  all  heard,  NASA  is  eliminating  the  funding  for
servicing  the  highly  productive  Hubble  Space  Telescope.  NASA  is
cutting  funding  it  contributes  to  the  National  Interagency  Initia-
tives  in  nanotechnology,  networking,  information  technology,  and
climate  change  science.  NASA 
for
hypersonics  research.  NASA  is  reducing  Space  Shuttle  Operation
reserves in fiscal year 2006 and 2007, in order to support the fund-
ing requirements of the Exploration Initiative. NASA is cutting the
funding  for  its  science  mission  operations  account,  an  action  that
will force the termination of some ongoing scientific spacecraft mis-
sions within the next year. I could cite other examples, but you get
the picture.

is  eliminating 

funding 

Contrary  to  the  image  it  has  fostered  of  a  measured,  go  as  you
pay  approach  for  exploration,  the  fact  is  that  NASA  is  protecting
the  funding  for  its  Exploration  Initiative  at  the  expense  of  other
programs.  I  think  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  unless  directed
otherwise, NASA will continue that approach in the future, as def-
icit  concerns  increasingly  squeeze  the  agency’s  budgetary  bottom
line.  And  as  I  have  previously  stated,  I  am  a  strong  supporter  of
exploration.  I  think  it  is  important  for  our  nation’s  human  space
flight  program  to  be—to  have  a  challenging,  long-term  goal.  And  I
agree  with  the  President  that  a  step  by  step  plan  for  exploration
makes the best sense. At the same time, I am very concerned that
the approach NASA is taking to exploration is not going to be sus-
tainable.

I am speaking as one who has to convince other Members of Con-
gress  of  the  value  of  investing  in  NASA  at  a  time  when  a  host  of
other  national  priorities  are  competing  for  the  same  dollars.  It
doesn’t  make  my  job  any  easier  when  Members  see  NASA  cutting
its  commitment  to  aeronautics  research  that  could  reduce  aircraft
noise  and  emissions,  and—or  improve  efficiency  and  safety  of  the
air  traffic  management  system,  or  cutting  its  commitment  to  re-
search  that  could  help  us  better  understand  the  impact  of  the  sun
on  weather  and  climate.  Or  eliminating  research  for  the  Inter-
national Space Station that NASA has long asserted would benefit
the  health  and  welfare  of  our  citizens  back  here  on  Earth,  espe-
cially  if  they  suspect  that  NASA  is  making  those  cuts  in  order  to
shift  money  to  an  Exploration  Initiative  whose  budget  doesn’t
match its goals.

It becomes even more difficult when these same Members look at
what NASA has been doing as part of its exploration initiative, and
start asking questions such as how could NASA first make the Ju-
piter  Icy  Moons  Orbiter  mission  its  showcase  flight  demonstration

of  the  initiative’s  nuclear  technology  program,  and  then  wind  up
having to shelve it because of, and I quote ‘‘concerns over cost and
technical  complexity.’’  Well,  why  did  NASA  make  purchasing  Rus-
sia’s  Soyuz  crew  transfer  and  rescue  services  a  basic  elements  of
its  human  space  flight  plan  when  the  current  law  prohibits  such
purchases? And now that NASA has done it, what is it going to do
next to make it work? Or finally, how does NASA justify its appar-
ent willingness to spend U.S. tax dollars to support European aero-
space companies as part of the Crew Exploration Vehicle program?
I  don’t  have  good  answers  to  these  questions,  and  I  hope  that  Mr.
Gregory will address them at today’s hearing.

Now,  before  I  close,  I  would  like  to  raise  one  final  issue.  NASA
is starting to make sweeping changes in its workforce and centers,
with  the  potential  for  several  thousands  of  its  employees  to  be  let
go,  numerous  facilities  to  be  consolidated  or  done  away  with,  and
one or more of the centers to be privatized or even closed. Yet nei-
ther  Congress  nor  NASA’s  own  employees  are  being  given  a  clear
picture of what is planned. I don’t think it is right to treat the dedi-
cated  men  and  women  of  NASA’s  workforce  that  way,  and  I  don’t
think it is the appropriate way to deal with Congress.

Mr. Chairman, we have important issues in front of us that need
our attention. We can start to address them at today’s hearing, but
I  hope  that  we  will  not  stop  with  a  single  hearing.  We  need  to  de-
vote  whatever  time  and  oversight  effort  is  needed  to  chart  a  rea-
sonable  path  for  NASA,  and  it  needs  to  be  a  path  that  is  sustain-
able.  I  don’t  want  to  see  us  on  the  Floor  of  the  House  in  a  couple
of years losing a vote to continue the program. I can still remember
when the Space Station program avoided a similar fate by only one
vote in 1993.

With that, I again want to welcome Mr. Gregory to today’s hear-

ing, and I look forward to your testimony.

Good morning. I’d like to join the Chairman in welcoming Mr. Gregory to today’s

I’d  also  like  to  take  a  moment  to  acknowledge  and  welcome  all  of  the  new  Mem-
bers  of  the  Committee  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle,  as  well  as  extend  my  good  wishes
to  Rep.  Calvert  and  Rep.  Udall  as  they  embark  on  their  responsibilities  as  Chair
and  Ranking  Member  of  the  Space  and  Aeronautics  Subcommittee.  In  those  capac-
ities  they  will  be  dealing  with  NASA-related  issues  on  a  regular  basis,  and  I  have
no doubt that they will do a good job.

Mr.  Chairman,  today’s  hearing  is  likely  to  be  one  of  the  most  important  ones  we
hold  this  Session.  More  than  a  year  has  now  passed  since  President  Bush  an-
nounced his space exploration initiative.

I for one support the President’s proposal if it is paid for and is sustainable. How-
ever,  since  the  time  the  initiative  was  first  announced,  there  has  been  little  oppor-
tunity  for  Congressional  scrutiny  or  debate  of  the  proposal.  And  there  has  been  no
opportunity to develop a consensus on what Congress thinks of the initiative, which
is very important if this committee is to successfully convince our colleagues to con-
tinue its funding for several years during tight budgets.

While  some  have  argued  that  the  funding  provided  to  NASA  in  the  Fiscal  Year
2005  omnibus  appropriation  constituted  a  Congressional  ‘‘mandate’’  for  the  Presi-
dent’s  initiative,  others  would  disagree.  In  point  of  fact,  Congress  was  being  asked
to vote up or down on a $388 billion spending bill funding a wide range of agencies
and activities—with no opportunity for amendments. NASA’s funding accounted for
only  about  four  percent  of  the  total  funding  in  that  bill.  And  despite  the  fact  that
NASA  received  close  to  its  FY05  request  level,  $1.5  billion  of  the  funds  provided  to

NASA  in  the  Omnibus  are  going  to  be  needed  to  pay  for  things—like  the  increase
in Shuttle return-to-flight costs—that weren’t in the original FY05 request.

So,  it  appears  that  we  are  entering  this  year  with  Congress’s  position  on  the  ex-
ploration  initiative  still  unresolved.  It  also  appears  that  Congress  is  going  to  have
to  address  some  fundamental  issues  as  we  assess  the  President’s  proposal,  notably:
• What  priority  should  the  President’s  exploration  initiative  have  relative  to
• Are we prepared to maintain the funding and schedule of the President’s ini-
tiative  even  if  it  results  in  the  loss  of  opportunities  in  space  and  Earth
science, in aeronautics research, in microgravity research and applications, in
research  into  low  cost/high  reliability  launch  technologies,  or  in  other  signifi-
cant research areas?

NASA’s other important missions?

• What role do we want NASA’s Centers to play in the future?
• What type of workforce do we envision for NASA?
• In  that  regard,  are  we  prepared  to  shed  highly  skilled  scientists,  engineers,
and technicians from NASA’s workforce if they do not directly support the re-
quirements of the President’s initiative?

These are not idle questions—they go to the heart of what we want from our na-
tion’s civil space and aeronautics program. Moreover, I do not believe that Congress
has the luxury of deferring consideration of these questions any longer.

One  thing  is  clear  from  NASA’s  FY06  budget  request  and  from  recent  actions
taken  by  the  agency:  In  the  absence  of  any  clear  Congressional  direction,  NASA  is
proceeding to move out aggressively to implement the President’s initiative.

As a result, we are starting to get a clearer picture of the Administration’s vision
for  NASA.  For  example,  just  one  year  after  President  Bush  launched  his  space  ex-
ploration  initiative,  the  Administration  has  already  started  back-pedaling  on  the
multi-year funding profile it had proposed for the agency.

As a result, the Administration is planning to cut a total of some $2.5 billion from
the  budget  plan  for  FY06  through  FY09  that  it  had  proposed  for  NASA  just  a  year
ago.

It is instructive to see how NASA proposes to allocate that cut—it would allocate
75  percent  of  the  required  cuts  to  NASA’s  science  and  aeronautics  programs  with
just 10 percent having to be absorbed by NASA’s Exploration Systems programs.

quest?

• NASA  is  reducing  Space  Shuttle  operations  reserves  in  FY06  and  FY07  in
• NASA is cutting the funding for its science mission operations account-an ac-
tion that will force the termination of some ongoing scientific spacecraft mis-

I could cite other examples, but you get the picture.
Contrary  to  the  image  it  has  fostered  of  a  measured,  ‘‘go  as  you  pay’’  approach
to  exploration,  the  fact  is  that  NASA  is  protecting  the  funding  for  its  exploration
initiative at the expense of its other programs.

I  think  it’s  reasonable  to  assume  that  unless  directed  otherwise,  NASA  will  con-
tinue that approach in the future as deficit concerns increasingly squeeze the agen-
cy’s budgetary bottom line.

As  I  have  previously  stated,  I  am  a  strong  supporter  of  exploration.  I  think  it’s
important  for  the  Nation’s  human  space  flight  program  to  have  challenging  long-
term  goals.  And  I  agree  with  the  President  that  a  step-by-step  plan  for  exploration
makes the best sense.

commitment to research that could help us better understand the impact of the Sun
on our weather and climate, or eliminating research on the International Space Sta-
tion  that  NASA  has  long  asserted  would  benefit  the  health  and  welfare  of  our  citi-
zens back here on Earth—especially if they suspect that NASA is making those cuts
in  order  to  shift  money  to  an  exploration  initiative  whose  budget  doesn’t  match  its
goals.

It  becomes  even  more  difficult  when  those  same  Members  look  at  what  NASA’s

been doing as part of its exploration initiative and start asking questions:

• Such  as,  how  could  NASA  first  make  the  Jupiter  Icy  Moons  Orbiter  (JIMO)
mission  its  showcase  flight  demonstration  of  the  initiative’s  nuclear  tech-
nology  program  and  then  wind  up  having  to  shelve  it  because  of  ‘‘concerns
over costs and technical complexity. . .’’?

• Or, why did NASA make purchasing Russian Soyuz crew transfer and rescue
services a basic element of its human space flight plan when current law pro-
hibits  such  purchases?  And  now  that  NASA’s  done  it,  what’s  it  going  to  do
next to make it work?

• Or finally, how does NASA justify its apparent willingness to spend U.S. tax-
payer  dollars  to  support  European  aerospace  companies  as  part  of  the  Crew
Exploration Vehicle (CEV) program?

I  don’t  have  good  answers  to  those  questions,  and  I  hope  that  Mr.  Gregory  will

address them at today’s hearing.

Now  before  I  close,  I  would  like  to  raise  one  additional  issue.  NASA  is  starting
to  make  sweeping  changes  to  its  workforce  and  Centers,  with  the  potential  for  sev-
eral  thousand  of  its  employees  to  be  let  go,  numerous  facilities  to  be  consolidated
or  done  away  with,  and  one  or  more  of  its  Centers  to  be  privatized  or  even  closed.
Yet  neither  Congress  nor  NASA’s  own  employees  are  being  given  a  clear  picture
of  what  is  planned.  I  don’t  think  that’s  the  right  way  to  treat  the  dedicated  men
and women of NASA’s workforce. And I don’t think it is an appropriate way to deal
with Congress.

Mr.  Chairman,  we  have  important  issues  in  front  of  us  that  need  our  attention.
We can start to address them at today’s hearing, but I hope that we will not stop
with a single hearing. We need to devote whatever time and oversight effort is need-
ed  to  chart  a  responsible  path  forward  for  NASA.  And  it  needs  to  be  a  path  that
is sustainable.

I don’t want to see us on the Floor of the House in a couple of years losing a vote
to  continue  the  program—I  can  still  remember  when  the  Space  Station  program
avoided a similar fate by only one vote in 1993.

With that, I again want to welcome Mr. Gregory to today’s hearing. I look forward

to your testimony.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Gordon.  The
Chairman of the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, Mr. Cal-
vert.

Mr. CALVERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I—also looking for-
ward to working with Mr. Udall, as I take on this—a new responsi-
bility,  and  I  would  like  to  welcome  Mr.  Gregory  for  his—and  his
colleagues  today  to  this  important  hearing,  a  hearing  that  will  set
the stage for the rest of the year. There are a lot of issues that we
are going to cover today, so I will keep my remarks very brief.

As  we  all  know,  this  is  a  crucial  time  for  NASA  and  the  civil
space  program.  NASA  has  made  progress  toward  returning  the
Shuttle  to  flight,  but  some  technical  issues  remain.  We  hope  and
believe  the  Shuttle  will  return  to  flight  when  it  is  ready  and  con-
tinue  the  assembly  of  the  International  Space  Station.  But  as  you
said,  no  later  than  2010,  the  Shuttle  will  be  retired,  so  we  can
move forward with the exciting and bold exploration vision laid out
by  the  President  over  a  year  ago,  a  vision  that  I  strongly  support.
Today,  it  is  important  that  we  get  a  better  understanding  of  the
priorities  reflected  in  NASA’s  budget  proposal  and  specifics  of  how
NASA intends to implement this vision. We also want to know how
NASA  intends  to  refocus  its  programs  on  the  exploration  vision

while  rebalancing  its  portfolio  of  science,  aeronautics  programs,
since these programs are also important to the Nation.

To  help  illuminate  this  issue,  I  plan  to  hold  hearings  focusing
specifically  on  NASA’s  various  roles,  missions,  and  infrastructure.
Just  as  important,  I  want  to  ensure  that  we  get  to  work  early  to
pass  an  authorization  bill  for  NASA.  We  haven’t  passed  one  since
2000.  I  think  it  is  important  we  not  turn  our  responsibilities  over
to the appropriators as we enter a new era of space exploration.

Lastly, I also look forward to the hearing on how NASA plans to
expand,  accelerate,  and  accommodate  America’s  growing  commer-
cial  and  entrepreneurial  spacefaring  community.  NASA  has  a  lot
on  its  plate.  As  this  new  Subcommittee  Chairman,  I  look  forward
to working with all my colleagues on this committee, the Adminis-
tration, and NASA to make sure the space program a success, and
with  that,  I  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  look  forward  to  the  hear-
ing.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE KEN CALVERT

Mr. Chairman, thank you. I would like to welcome Mr. Gregory and his colleagues
today to this important hearing, a hearing that will set the stage for the rest of the
year.  There  are  a  lot  of  issues  we  need  to  cover,  so  I  will  keep  my  remarks  very
brief.  As  we  all  know,  this  is  a  critical  time  for  NASA  and  the  civil  space  program.
NASA  has  made  solid  progress  toward  returning  the  Shuttle  to  flight,  but  some
tough  technical  issues  remain.  We  hope  and  believe  that  the  Shuttle  will  return  to
flight  when  it  is  ready  and  continue  the  assembly  of  the  International  Space  Sta-
tion. In 2010, the Shuttle will be retired, so we can move forward with the exciting
and bold exploration vision laid out by the President over a year ago.

Today,  it  is  important  that  we  get  a  better  understanding  of  the  priorities  re-
flected in NASA’s budget proposal and the specifics of how NASA intends to imple-
ment  the  vision.  We  also  want  to  know  how  NASA  intends  to  refocus  its  programs
on the exploration vision while maintaining a balanced portfolio of science and aero-
nautics programs, since these programs are also vitally important to the Nation.

NASA  has  a  lot  on  its  plate  and  as  the  new  Subcommittee  Chairman  I  look  for-
ward  to  working  with  my  colleagues  on  the  Committee,  the  Administration,  and
NASA to make sure our space program is a success.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.
Now,  Mr.  Udall,  the  Ranking  Member  of  the  Subcommittee  on
Space and Aeronautics.

Mr.  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  welcome,  Mr.  Greg-

ory. We look forward to hearing your testimony today.

As  we  all  know,  NASA  is  an  important  part  of  the  Nation’s
science and technology infrastructure, and at their best, NASA’s ac-
tivities  advance  knowledge,  inspire  our  youth,  and  improve  the
quality  of  life  for  our  citizens.  So  it  is  important  that  Congress  be
involved  in  decisions  on  NASA’s  future,  and  along  with  my  col-
leagues,  I  think  this,  and  I  know  this  hearing  can  be  a  good  start
toward  gaining  the  information  that  we  will  need  to  make  sure
that  those  decisions  are  informed  ones.  In  that  regard,  I  look  for-
ward  to  working  with  Mr.  Calvert  in  my  new  capacity  as  Ranking
Member  on  the  Space  and  Aeronautics  Subcommittee  to  carry  out
additional oversight.

Mr.  Chairman,  as  you  do,  I  consider  myself  to  be  a  champion  of
space  exploration  in  its  broadest  sense,  which  is  the  adventure  of
pushing back the boundaries of our ignorance with both robotic and
human explorers, as well as with researchers in the laboratory and

the  observatory.  I  confess  that  I  am—as  I  think  we  all  are  here,
a  bit  troubled  that  the  President’s  Exploration  Initiative  seems  to
be  couched  in  terms  of  having  to  walk  away  from  important  re-
search  areas  in  science  and  aeronautics  if  we  want  to  do  explo-
ration.  One  of  those  important  research  projects  is,  of  course,  the
Hubble  Telescope,  which  we  all  intend  to  discuss  further  during
this  hearing.  But  it  is  not  the  only  one.  Nevertheless,  I  think  we
are  being  presented  with  a  false  choice.  We  should  be  able  to  do
both.  It  may  require  adjusting  the  pace  of  the  President’s  Explo-
ration  Initiative,  or  making  a  tough  love  prioritization  of  the  pro-
posed exploration programs, but I believe it can be done. To do oth-
erwise is to risk losing the fruits of investments we have made over
the last 45 years to establish and maintain our current world class
capabilities for research at NASA and at our universities.

In  addition,  I  think  we  should  never  forget  that  an  important
component  of  those  world  class  capabilities  is  in  the  NASA  work-
force.  As  you  may  know,  I  have  several  federal  laboratories  in  my
district,  and  I  have  developed  a  keen  appreciation  for  the  intellec-
tual capital that resides in those laboratories. And I have no doubt
that  similarly  impressive  intellectual  capital  exists  at  the  NASA
centers, though in contemplating changes to NASA’s workforce, we
should  proceed  very  carefully.  Change  by  itself  is  inherently  nei-
ther  good  nor  bad.  It  is  just  change.  However,  if  we  make  precipi-
tous changes to those centers without considering what the Nation
will  want  from  NASA  in  the  future,  we  risk  losing  valuable  skills
and intellectual capital that we may never be able to recover.

Now, I know that some champions of the President’s vision want
to  move  quickly  to  realign  NASA  to  conform  to  that  vision.  How-
ever,  as  Members  of  Congress,  I  think  we  need  to  step  back  and
take  the  broader  view.  We  need  to  ask  some  hard  questions,  such
as  what  do  we  want  NASA  to  be?  What  are  we  asking  NASA  to
contribute to our society and to our economy, and what steps do we
need to make to ensure that NASA will retain the capacity to make
those  contributions  for  decades  to  come?  It  is  not  going  to  be  easy
to  answer  these  questions.  Nevertheless,  it  is  vital  that  Congress,
working with the Administration, try to answer them.

With  that,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  yield  back  the  balance  of  my  time,
and  I  welcome  you  again,  Mr.  Gregory,  and  look  forward  to  your
testimony. Thank you.

important research projects is of course the Hubble Telescope, which I intend to dis-
cuss further during this hearing, but it’s not the only one.

Nevertheless, I think we’re being presented with a false choice. We should be able
to  do  both.  It  may  require  adjusting  the  pace  of  the  President’s  exploration  initia-
tive,  or  making  a  ‘‘tough  love’’  prioritization  of  the  proposed  exploration  pro-
grams. . .but  I  believe  it  can  be  done.  To  do  otherwise  is  to  risk  losing  the  fruits
of investments we have made over the last 45 years or more to establish and main-
tain  our  current  world-class  capabilities  for  research  at  NASA  and  at  our  univer-
sities across a wide range of scientific and technological disciplines.

In addition, I think we should never forget that an important component of those
world-class  capabilities  is  the  NASA  workforce.  As  you  may  know,  I  have  several
federal  laboratories  in  my  district.  I  have  developed  a  keen  appreciation  for  the  in-
tellectual  capital  that  resides  in  those  laboratories.  And  I  have  no  doubt  that  simi-

plating  changes  to  NASA’s  workforce,  we  should  proceed  very  carefully.  Change  by
itself is inherently neither good nor bad—it’s just change. However, if we make pre-
cipitous  changes  to  those  Centers  without  considering  what  the  Nation  will  want
from NASA in the future.. . . We risk losing valuable skills and intellectual capital
that we may never be able to recover.

I  know  that  some  champions  of  the  President’s  exploration  vision  want  to  move
quickly  to  realign  NASA  to  conform  to  that  vision.  However,  as  Members  of  Con-
gress, I think we need to step back and take the broader view. We need to ask some

[The prepared statement of Mr. Ehlers follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE VERNON J. EHLERS

I  believe  that  NASA’s  decision  to  abandon  a  Hubble  telescope  servicing  mission
is  unwise  and  shortsighted.  Given  Hubble’s  tremendous  history  of  scientific  dis-
covery  and  its  continuing  potential,  there  is  no  question  as  to  the  value  of  such  a
mission.  I  understand  that  the  reasoning  that  led  to  this  decision  for  decommis-
sioning  instead  of  a  servicing  mission  is  the  purported  safety  risks  to  astronauts.
While  this  is,  of  course,  an  important  consideration,  I  believe  the  calculated  risk
does not outweigh the potential benefits of such a mission.

Currently,  there  are  28  different  missions  planned  by  the  Space  Shuttle  to  the
International Space Station (ISS) before the vessel’s retirement in 2010. With a his-
tory  of  only  two  accidents  in  113  Shuttle  flights,  for  any  single  flight  there  is  a  1.8
percent chance of failure. With 28 planned missions to the ISS, the cumulative risk
of a single accident over the course of those missions is substantially higher (almost
40  percent).  Simple  mathematics  shows  me  that  one  mission  to  service  the  Hubble
telescope  makes  sense,  given  the  minimal  risk  to  the  astronauts  and  the  tremen-
dous  and  proven  scientific  potential  of  the  instrument.  Coupled  with  the  time  that
will  be  lost  before  another  telescope  is  launched,  decommissioning  this  telescope  is
clearly  a  questionable  decision.  In  the  case  of  Hubble,  stewardship  of  our  existing
telescope is the smartest investment of our federal dollars.

With a 1.8 percent risk to the astronauts of one Hubble mission, we get a tremen-
dous  amount  of  science  accomplished,  whereas,  with  the  28  missions  to  the  ISS
there is uncertain scientific achievement coupled with a significantly higher risk. If
NASA’s goal is to conduct missions of the greatest scientific value and least amount
of  risk  to  astronauts,  then  clearly,  a  single  mission  to  fix  Hubble  is  the  right  deci-
sion.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE J. RANDY FORBES

In  only  the  last  half  century,  space  exploration  and  scientific  discovery  have
brought  an  unquantifiable  richness  to  human  life.  America’s  space  program  is  a
symbol  of  our  success  as  a  scientifically  and  technologically  advanced  nation.  I  am

exploration, however I am concerned that the FY 2006 Budget proposes cuts to vital
programs that are not related to NASA’s Vision for Space Exploration.

In  particular,  I  remain  concerned  that  reduced  federal  funding  for  aviation  and
aeronautics research and technology in FY 2006 will jeopardize the Nation’s leader-
ship  in  providing  the  technologies  needed  to  develop  the  next  generation  aircraft,
improve  aviation  safety  and  security,  and  attract  the  next  generation  of  aerospace
scientists  and  engineers.  We  are  in  danger  of  falling  behind  our  competitors  in  Eu-
rope  who  have  announced  that  their  goal  is  to  dominate  commercial  aviation  sales
by 2020.

In  addition,  cuts  to  the  NASA  Aeronautics  budget  will  have  a  profound  impact
on the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, which has a long and
proud  history  of  aeronautics  research.  NASA  Langley’s  wind  tunnels  and  labora-
tories,  research  aircraft  and  spacecraft  and  flight  simulators  have  made  significant
contributions  to  our  nation’s  advances  in  the  aeronautics  industry  and  have  the
promise of yielding many more in the future.

Like  the  explorers  of  the  past  and  the  pioneers  of  flight  in  the  last  century,  we
cannot  identify  today  all  that  we  will  gain  from  aviation  and  aeronautics  research;
however,  we  know  from  experience  that  the  eventual  return  will  be  great.  And  the
greater  the  investments  of  today,  the  greater  the  rewards  for  generations  to  come.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good morning. I want to thank Honorable Frederick Gregory for appearing before
our committee to discuss the NASA’s FY06 budget proposal. Today’s hearing serves
as  an  opportunity  for  oversight  of  certain  departmental  programs.  On  January  14,
2004, the President announced his space exploration initiative which provides much
needed  long-term  goals  for  our  nation’s  human  space  flight  program.  The  lack  of
clear  direction  has  hampered  NASA’s  effectiveness  and  has  kept  it  from  realizing
its full potential as the Nation’s space agency. During last fall’s FY05 Omnibus, the
appropriators  gave  NASA  a  great  deal  of  latitude  to  determine  how  their  money
would  be  allocated.  The  understanding  was  that  the  appropriations  committees
would  review  the  funding  programs  as  part  of  the  Operating  Plan  process.  Months
later,  it  is  unacceptable  that  NASA  has  only  submitted  an  initial  Operating  Plan
that provides only partial information on how it intends to allocate its FY05 appro-
priation.  I  support  the  action  of  Ranking  Member  Gordon,  who  sent  a  letter  to
NASA  indicating  that  he  did  not  concur  with  the  Operating  Plan  submission  be-
cause it was incomplete.

It  is  troubling  that  NASA  continues  to  proceed  on  implementation  of  the  Presi-
dent’s  exploration  initiative  in  the  absence  of  any  clear  Congressional  direction  on
their priorities, their missions, and the future role of NASA Centers. In light of the
President’s  new  initiative,  the  budget  for  NASA  leaves  many  significant  questions
unanswered and Congress needs more specifics as we consider the FY06 budget re-
quest for NASA.

NASA  continues  to  be  our  gateway  to  the  universe.  It  is  through  NASA’s  efforts
that  we  will  understand  our  planet,  our  solar  system  and  beyond.  NASA’s  budget
should  reflect  a  strong  commitment  to,  and  emphasis  on,  continuing  to  build  the
agency’s core foundation of aeronautics and aerospace research and development as
well as its missions of exploration and discovery to educate and inspire.

While  the  President’s  initiative  envisions  human  lunar  landings  by  2020  and
human missions to Mars at some point in the future, I am concerned that one year
later,  the  budget  plan  for  NASA  has  worsened,  and  the  majority  of  the  funding
shortfall is to be absorbed by NASA’s non-exploration initiative-related programs.

Finally,  I  am  concerned  that  many  important  and  promising  programs,  such  as
the  education  programs  and  space  station  research,  would  be  eliminated  or  have
their funding cut, deferred, or flattened in order to fund the space exploration initia-
tive. NASA’s track record on the credibility of its cost estimates over the last several
years  is  at  best  mixed.  The  President’s  proposal  will  have  a  high  price  tag  and  it
should  not  come  at  the  cost  of  our  commitment  to  our  children,  our  veterans,  our
seniors, and our other important domestic priorities. The federal deficit for 2004 will
be a record $413 billion and the case is going to have to be made to this committee
and  the  American  people  why  the  space  exploration  initiative  should  be  supported
in the face of that deficit.

I welcome our witnesses and look forward to their testimony.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

23

First  of  all,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Chairman  for  bringing  us  together  for  this

hearing today.

The purpose of this hearing is to examine the President’s proposed budget for the

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for fiscal year 2006.

I  have  always  been  a  strong  supporter  of  the  U.S.  Space  Program.  I  am  a  firm
believer that the United States should continue our space program that has accom-
plished so much in the areas of research and science.

While  I  am  happy  that  the  Administration’s  budget  request  is  an  increase  from
last  year’s,  there  are  still  many  questions  that  must  be  addressed.  I  am  quite  con-
cerned  that  this  budget  is  actually  lower  that  what  was  stated  for  the  President’s
Vision  for  Space  Exploration.  How  does  NASA  plan  on  reaching  these  goals  with
$2.5 million less than what was original stated?

It  is  imperative  that  we  today  discuss  safety  and  our  return-to-flight  plans,  since
space travel is inherently dangerous. Under no circumstances should we allow budg-
et cuts to ever interfere with the responsibility of maintaining safety.

With that being said, I would like to again thank the Chair and Ranking Member

for holding this hearing and the witness for agreeing to answer questions.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Honda follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL M. HONDA

Chairman  Boehlert  and  Ranking  Member  Gordon,  thank  you  for  holding  this  im-
portant  hearing  today.  This  is  an  essential  first  step  in  the  oversight  process  it  is
our committee’s responsibility to perform. I emphasize that this is a first step, how-
ever—we must be sure to pay close attention to NASA represented here, both to cel-
ebrate  successes  and  to  make  sure  the  agency  is  doing  the  job  we  expect  it  to  do
in the way we expect it to do that job.

The  number  one  issue  in  my  mind  as  we  discuss  this  budget  is  the  ‘‘Trans-
formation’’  that  NASA  is  executing  in  order  to  carry  out  the  President’s  Vision  for
Space  Exploration.  I  am  very  concerned  about  the  lack  of  Congressional  oversight
of  this  transformation  and  the  fact  that  NASA  has  not  provided  us  with  timely  in-
formation about changes that are taking place.

I  know  that  our  side  of  the  aisle  had  serious  concerns  when  NASA  sought  to
switch to the Full Cost Accounting system, and I think that our greatest fears have
come  true.  Full  Cost  Accounting  has  been  combined  with  broad  discretionary  au-
thority  granted  to  the  agency  in  the  Fiscal  Year  2005  Omnibus  Appropriations  bill
to create a situation in which the salaries of vast numbers of Civil Service R&D em-
ployees  are  being  moved  out  of  project  accounts  and  into  general  operations,  which
has created an artificial crisis at the centers and is being used as a reason to under-
take  large  scale  workforce  reductions.  To  date,  NASA  has  not  provided  us  with  a
detailed  Operations  Plan  outlining  how  these  changes  are  being  made,  and  NASA
has  not  provided  requested  documentation  outlining  those  ‘‘excess  competencies’’
broken down by Center, so that it would be possible to see what areas NASA man-
agement considered to be no longer important to pursue. We must be kept informed,
but  NASA  is  doing  everything  to  prevent  that—according  to  a  Center  director,  a
page  from  NASA’s  budget  submission  to  Congress  about  Civil  Service  employment
numbers at the Centers should be ignored because it does not make any sense. How
is it that Congress is not being given accurate information?

A  big  question  in  all  of  this  ‘‘transforming’’  is  whether  NASA  will  continue  to
honor  the  obligations  it  has  already  made.  There  are  many  research  contracts  and
cooperative agreements between the agency and Centers and outside entities whose
status  remains  uncertain.  Without  a  detailed  Operations  Plan,  we  can  not  know
what the future of these agreements is.

I have a large number of questions that I want answers to, a larger number than
I should have, because up to this point NASA has not been doing a good job of com-
municating with the Congress. I hope that I can start to get some answers to these
questions at today’s hearing.

Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member.

The  Administration  has  repeatedly  asked  for  billions  upon  billions  of  dollars  for

the Iraq conflict. An exit strategy has not been developed.

Our health care system is broken. More than 45 million people are uninsured. In
my  own  State,  TennCare  is  in  danger  of  collapse  and  will  cause  thousands  more  to
become uninsured.

And we are discussing an aggressive Space program? Mr. Chairman, my constitu-
ents  and  I  understand  the  benefits  of  science  and  technology  research,  and  we  see
the benefits of space research. But our nation is leaving a multi-trillion dollar deficit
to  its  grandchildren,  and  as  a  Blue  Dog,  I  want  to  express  my  disagreement  with
the Administration’s aggressive space exploration agenda.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSS CARNAHAN

Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member, thank you for hosting this hearing, and
Mr.  Gregory,  thank  you  for  joining  us  today  to  discuss  the  NASA  proposed  budget
request. I am very interested in hearing your testimony.

I, as many on this committee, will be paying particular attention to what NASA’s
budgetary decisions mean for the long-term direction of the agency. I hope that you
can  elaborate  on  whether  or  not  you  believe  it  is  possible  for  NASA  to  accomplish
the  President’s  space  exploration  agenda  while  simultaneously  maintaining  strong
programs in each of NASA’s mission areas.

Furthermore,  I  want  to  state  that  I  am  concerned  about  a  few  specific  elements
of the budget. Specifically, I am troubled by both the decision to discontinue funding
for  hypersonic  work  in  both  my  home  State  of  Missouri  and  in  Tennessee  as  well
as the potential for halting development of the ISS centrifuge facility. Finally, I be-
lieve  it  is  problematic  that  bidding  on  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  may  produce
an outcome in which non-U.S. companies are paid with U.S. taxpayer dollars.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON LEE

Chairman Boehlert, Ranking Member Gordon,

I  want  to  thank  you  for  organizing  this  important  hearing  to  discuss  NASA’s
budget  proposal  for  fiscal  year  2006.  I  want  to  welcome  Mr.  Gregory,  NASA’s  Dep-
uty  Administrator  and  thank  him  for  coming  before  this  committee  this  morning.
NASA faces a watershed moment after having endured a tremendous tragedy in the
Columbia disaster and now trying to map its future with a return to the Moon and
manned exploration of Mars.

Unfortunately,  while  I  wholeheartedly  support  the  work  of  NASA,  I  am  deeply
concerned  that  the  President’s  budget  does  not  meet  all  the  needs  for  future  space
exploration  as  we  move  forward  in  this  new  century.  As  I  have  stated  before,  this
Administration  has  made  many  bad  budgetary  choices,  which  continue  to  push  us
further  into  a  huge  deficits  and  mounting  debt  during  the  last  four  years.  In  addi-
tion, the President has proposed a highly questionable plan for Social Security along
with an uncertain military future in Iraq that in conjunction with proposed $1.6 tril-
lion  tax  cuts  will  result  in  less  funds  being  available  for  vital  agencies  such  as
NASA.

I  have  been  supportive  of  President  Bush’s  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  because
I  firmly  believe  that  the  invest  we  make  today  in  science  and  exploration  will  pay
large dividends in the future. Similarly, I do not want to put a cap on the frontiers
of our discovery, NASA should aim high and continue to push our nation at the fore-
front of space exploration. However, I find it to be more supportive of the President’s
plan,  when  I  have  no  real  specifics  as  to  what  this  plan  will  entail.  Large  missions
of  this  sort  require  detailed  planning  and  as  a  Members  of  Congress  we  deserve  to
know  how  exactly  the  President’s  plan  proposes  to  accomplish  its  objectives  so  that
we  can  set  out  the  proper  resources  and  provide  the  necessary  oversight.  In  addi-
tion, the President stated that the fundamental goal of his directive for the Nation’s
space exploration program is ‘‘. . .to advance U.S. scientific, security, and economic
interests through a robust space exploration program.’’ I could not agree more with
that  statement;  unfortunately,  this  President’s  own  budget  does  not  meet  the  de-
mands  of  his  ambitious  agenda.  One  year  after  the  Administration  laid  out  a  five-
year funding plan for NASA that was intended to demonstrate the affordability and
sustainability  of  the  exploration  initiative,  the  Administration  has  submitted  a
budget  proposal  for  2006  that  would  reduce  that  funding  plan  by  $2.5  billion  over

the  next  four  years.  For  example,  in  2006,  the  Administration  is  seeking  $546  mil-
lion  less  than  it  said  would  be  needed  for  NASA  in  2006  in  the  five-year  funding
plan  that  accompanied  last  year’s  request.  In  fact  75  percent  of  the  $2.5  billion
shortfall  will  fall  to  NASA’s  science  and  aeronautics  programs.  This  kind  of  under
funding for vital programs is unacceptable. Again, it is even more alarming because
the  President  has  not  provided  a  detailed  plan  as  to  how  he  intends  to  accomplish
his  space  exploration  agenda;  certainly  draining  money  from  the  budget  will  not
help that cause.

My  greatest  concern  with  this  budget  is  that  it  may  not  allocate  enough  money
for  ensuring  the  safety  of  all  NASA  astronauts  and  crew.  After  the  Columbia  dis-
aster,  safety  must  be  our  highest  priority  and  it  is  worrisome  that  there  is  not  a
noticeable  increase  in  funding  to  address  all  safety  concerns.  Presently,  NASA  is
working  towards  a  resumption  of  Space  Shuttle  flights,  with  return-to-flight  cur-
rently  scheduled  for  mid-May.  However,  once  NASA  returns  the  Shuttle  to  flight
status, it is then supposed to begin the task of figuring out how to retire the Space
Shuttle  fleet  in  2010  while  continuing  to  fly  the  Shuttle  safely  up  to  the  very  last
flight. I am concerned that pressure to retire the Shuttle by a fixed date to free up
resources  for  other  activities,  coupled  with  the  need  to  fly  up  to  28  Shuttle  flights
to  assemble  the  Space  Station,  could—if  not  handled  properly—lead  to  the  types  of
schedule  and  budgetary  pressures  that  were  cited  by  the  Columbia  Accident  Inves-
tigation Board (CAIB) as contributing to the Columbia accident. I hope this concern
is paramount at NASA as we move forward in the future.

While this NASA budget is supposed to move us forward toward exciting new dis-
coveries,  I  was  deeply  disturbed  to  find  that  this  budget  if  approved  will  mean  the
end  of  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope.  The  Hubble  Space  Telescope  has  been  one  of
the  most  productive  and  successful  scientific  facilities  ever  deployed.  Hubble  was
originally  intended  to  be  operated  with  periodic  manned  servicing  missions  using
the  Space  Shuttle.  However,  since  the  grounding  of  the  Shuttle,  NASA  Adminis-
trator  O’Keefe  has  canceled  the  final  scheduled  servicing  mission  to  Hubble.  With-
out this servicing mission, Hubble’s support systems (gyroscopes for maintaining ori-
entation,  batteries  to  power  heaters)  will  fail  causing  irreversible  damage  to  the
spacecraft. Three servicing options have been identified to deal with Hubble: 1) com-
plete the scheduled manned servicing mission; 2) use a robotic spacecraft to service
Hubble;  and  3)  incorporate  ground  based  replacement  parts  intended  for  Hubble  in
a  new  telescope.  At  this  time,  none  of  those  options  have  been  exercised.  Unfortu-
nately, the only funds attached for Hubble in this budget will go towards de-orbiting
the telescope. I believe there is a better way to keep Hubble in service where it has
served  our  nation  and  in  fact  the  world  so  well.  Now  is  not  the  time  to  digress  in
terms of our discovery, Hubble served an essential function in our space exploration
efforts.  I  hope  that  this  Committee  and  Congress  as  a  whole  will  work  to  save  the
Hubble telescope before we lose a valuable asset.

As  Members  of  this  committee  know,  I  have  always  been  a  strong  advocate  for
NASA. My criticism of the President’s budget is intended only to strengthen our ef-
forts  to  move  forward  as  we  always  have  in  the  area  of  space  exploration  and  dis-
covery.  NASA  poses  an  exciting  opportunity  to  charter  a  new  path  that  can  lead  to
untold  discoveries.  As  always  I  look  forward  to  working  with  the  good  men  and
women of NASA as we push the boundaries of our world once again.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JIM MATHESON

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Ranking  Member  Gordon.  As  a  supporter  of
science,  I  am  well  aware  that  space  exploration  benefits  Americans  by  encouraging
innovation  in  defense,  education,  communications,  scientific  research,  and  commer-
cial technology.

Today, I am concerned that the benefits of research are being curtailed by NASA’s

foolhardy decision to cancel a servicing missing to the Hubble Space Telescope.

Hubble  is  one  of  the  crown  jewels  of  America’s  space  science  enterprise.  Some  of
the greatest scientific benefits from the Hubble Space Telescope have been the unex-
pected discoveries that have expanded our knowledge about our solar system. It has
also proven to be a powerful scientific and educational tool. I find it hard to believe
that NASA is so willing to abandon this incredible project.

Just a few weeks ago, this committee heard testimony from Dr. Louis Lanzerotti,
Chair of the National Research Council panel, who asked to examine the issues sur-
rounding the cancellation of Hubble’s final servicing mission. His panel’s report con-
cluded that NASA should commit to a Shuttle-based Hubble serving mission, allow-
ing the telescope to continue its highly productive scientific mission.

26

Space industry workers in my home State of Utah and in other parts of our nation
have already dedicated years of service to the Shuttle. They stand ready to continue
that  effort,  so  that  Hubble  can  be  serviced  safely  and  efficiently.  Finally,  both  the
general public and the scientific community are very opposed to the discontinuation
of Hubble and to the reckless postponement of needed servicing missions.

I hope that NASA reviews and reconsiders its decision to cancel what would have

been the fifth and final Hubble servicing mission. Thank you.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Our  first  and  only  witness  today  is  the
Deputy  Administrator,  soon  to  be  Acting  Administrator  of  NASA,
the Honorable Fred Gregory. We are very familiar with your work,
Mr.  Gregory.  We  thank  you  for  your  years  of  very  distinguished
service  to  the  Nation  in  a  variety  of  capacities.  And  I  understand
you  will  be  accompanied  by,  and  that  is  why  we  have  the  six
chairs, Mr. James Jennings, Associate Deputy Administrator, Insti-
tutions  and  Asset  Management;  Rear  Admiral  Craig  Steidle,  Asso-
ciate  Administrator,  Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate;  Mr.
William  Readdy,  Associate  Administrator,  Space  Operations  Mis-
sion  Directorate;  Mr.  Alphonso  Diaz,  Associate  Administrator,
Science  Mission  Directorate;  Dr.  Victor  Lebacqz,  Associate  Admin-
istrator,  Aeronautics  Research  Mission  Directorate;  and  Mr.  Steve
Isakowitz,  Comptroller,  Office  of  the  Chief  Financial  Officer.  And
Mr. Readdy, I am sorry for mispronouncing your name.

Gentleman,  take  your  seats,  behind  a  multi-hatted  Mr.  Gregory.
Mr.  Gregory,  you  know  the  drill.  And  usually,  we  ask  witnesses,
because  we  have  many  panels  and  many  distinguished  witnesses,
to  summarize  the  statement.  We  are  not  going  to  waive  that.  We
would ask you to summarize your statement, but we are not going
to be so arbitrary as to only give you five minutes. But the shorter
your  statement,  the  more  opportunity  we  have  for  a  dialogue,
which  we  have  always  found  to  be  the  most  productive  part  of
these hearings.

So the floor is yours.

STATEMENT  OF  HON.  FREDERICK  D.  GREGORY,  DEPUTY  AD-
MINISTRATOR,  NATIONAL  AERONAUTICS  AND  SPACE  AD-
MINISTRATION
Mr.  GREGORY.  Well,  first  of  all,  let  me  tell  you  what  a  privilege
it is to sit before such an august body. And Mr. Boehlert, thank you
very  much  for  inviting  Mr.  O’Keefe  to  come,  and  then  allowing  me
to  be,  I  hope,  a  worthy  substitute.  Ranking  Member  Gordon  and
the Committee Members, thank you for this opportunity to discuss
this—NASA’s fiscal year 2006 budget request.

This  October  1,  on  the  day  when  the  new  fiscal  year  begins,
NASA will be entering our 48th year of serving the public interest,
inspiring—and  inspiring  the  next  generation  of  explorers.  For  31
years,  I  have  had  the  privilege  to  serve  on  the  NASA  team,  first
as a test pilot, then as an astronaut, and more recently now as part
of  Agency  leadership.  I  have  never  been  as  proud  of  our  work  and
as hopeful about the space program’s future as I am today. The ex-
citing  science  findings  on  our  Mars  and  Saturn  missions,  the  re-
search  we  are  conducting  on  the  International  Space  Station,  and
the  assistance  NASA  satellites  provided  to  Tsunami  relief  efforts
highlight  NASA’s  relevance  in  advancing  America’s  scientific  and
technological leadership, and in providing people with tangible ben-
efits.

These accomplishments in NASA’s steady progress towards safe-
ty, safely returning the Space Shuttle to flight, are the products of
a team that has strived very diligently since the Columbia accident
to operate all our missions safely and successfully. They also reflect
Sean  O’Keefe’s  outstanding  leadership  of  the  Agency  these  past
three  years,  and  I  certainly  thank  you  for  acknowledging  Sean’s
work.  To  be  certain,  NASA’s  successes  also  reflect  a  strong  spirit
of  cooperation  between  the  Administration  and  Congress.  We  ap-
preciate  your  role  in  helping  us  to  set  program  priorities,  and  in
providing  constructive  oversight  of  NASA  activities.  We  look  for-
ward  to  working  with  you  to  help  advance  the  Nation’s  Vision  for
Space Exploration. Now well under way, the Vision promises to ad-
vance U.S. scientific, security, and economic interests through a ro-
bust program of human and robotic space exploration.

Significantly,  this  budget  will  fully  support  the  vision  activities
underway  here  on  Earth,  in  low-Earth  orbit,  and  throughout  the
solar  system.  It  will  also  enable  significant  progress  in  other  re-
search priorities, such as aeronautics and Earth science. The budg-
et  as  is—is,  as  promised,  affordable,  representing  a  2.4  percent  in-
crease in a very tight fiscal environment. Finally, this budget is fo-
cused,  as  a  result  of  NASA’s  disciplined  effort  to  set  priorities  and
align  our  workforce,  organizational  structures,  facilities,  and  part-
nerships, with the unifying goals that many in Congress have long
called  for.  The  budget  will  provide  resources  to  support  Shuttle’s
safe Return-to-Flight, the continued assembly and operations of the
International  Space  Station,  progress  on  the  Crew  Exploration  Ve-
hicle,  and  the  development  of  several  transformative  technologies.
The  budget  will  enable  a  new  series  of  lunar  science  missions,  be-
ginning  in  2008,  and  the  new  Mars  missions,  targeted  to  begin  in
2011.  And  yes,  this  budget  continues  NASA’s  commitment  to  con-
ducting world class astronomy. It will help us maintain our current
fleet  of  orbiting  laboratories,  the  Chandra,  which  is  an  X-ray  ob-
servatory, the Spitzer, an infrared space telescope, and the Hubble
Space  Telescope,  and  develop  impressive  new  tools,  such  as  the
James Webb Telescope and the Kepler Planet-Finding Telescope.

Under  this  budget  plan,  we  will  strive  to  extend  the  scientific
lifetime  of  Hubble  through  at  least  2007  and  possibly  further,  as
well  as  support  the  analysis  of  past  and  current  Hubble  images.
The  budget  also  builds  on  NASA’s  long-standing  effort  to  improve
life  here,  and  better  understand  our  home  planet.  It  emphasizes
our  aeronautics  research  to  enhance  aviation  safety  and  security,
increases  the  efficiency  of  air  traffic  management,  and  invests  in
barrier-breaking  technologies.  Also,  we  will  continue  to  add  to  the
constellation  of  Earth-observing  satellites,  and  develop  new  space-
based technologies, and link systems for Earth observation.

Finally,  we  will  determine—we  are  determined  to  inspire  and
motivate  the  next  generation  of  explorers,  through  a  variety  of  in-
novative  programs,  such  as  the  NASA  Explorer  Schools  and  the
Scholarship  for  Service  program.  Significantly,  the  Scholarship  for
Service  program  is  one  of  the  many  elements  of  NASA’s  strategy
to help ensure that we sustain the Vision over the long haul. Under
this strategy, we are also taking steps to reshape NASA’s workforce
so that our skillsets are properly aligned with our mission require-
ments.  This  obviously  will  cause  some  impact  on  the  NASA  work-

force, but positively, we know that the vast majority of our existing
skillset  is  directly  applicable  to  this  Vision.  We  also  know  that  we
have a large number of people eligible for retirement. Through our
tools like the Workforce Flexibility Act of 2004, NASA plans to stra-
tegically build up our talent base for the future. To advance the Vi-
sion,  we  will  also  pursue  innovative  partnerships  with  academia,
aerospace  firms,  and  entrepreneurial  companies.  And  we  will  en-
courage  NASA  centers  to  compete  for  useful  work  on  technologies
that can spin in to exploration agenda, and spin out into the econ-
omy at large.

Indeed, all of NASA’s strategic and transformational changes are
oriented  to  making  the  Agency  an  even  more  vital  contributor  to
the  prosperity  and  well  being  of  the  21st  Century  America.  That
is what this budget is all about, investing in the great cause of ex-
ploration and discovery, and the development of revolutionary tech-
nologies and capabilities for the future.

I  thank  you  once  again  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  this
committee  this  morning,  and  I  look  forward  to  your  questions.
Thank you, sir.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Gregory follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF FREDERICK D. GREGORY

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to
appear  today  to  discuss  NASA’s  plans  for  the  future  as  represented  in  the  Presi-
dent’s FY 2006 budget request for NASA. I will outline the major budget highlights
and  discuss  NASA’s  transformation  progress  and  strategic  direction,  and  describe
how exciting the Nation’s future will be in exploration and discovery.

As  Members  are  aware,  on  January  14,  2004,  President  George  W.  Bush  an-
nounced  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration.  The  President’s  directive  gave  NASA  a
new  and  historic  focus  and  clear  objectives.  The  fundamental  goal  of  this  directive
for  the  Nation’s  space  exploration  program  is  ‘‘. . .to  advance  U.S.  scientific,  secu-
rity, and economic interests through a robust space exploration program.’’ In issuing
this  directive,  the  President  committed  the  Nation  to  a  journey  of  exploring  the
solar  system  and  beyond,  returning  humans  to  the  Moon,  and  sending  robots  and
ultimately  humans  to  Mars  and  other  destinations.  He  challenged  us  to  establish
new  and  innovative  programs  to  enhance  our  understanding  of  the  planets,  to  ask
new  questions,  and  to  answer  questions  as  old  as  humankind.  NASA  enthusiasti-
cally  embraced  this  directive  and  immediately  began  a  long-term  transformation
that will enable us to achieve this goal.

In June 2004, the President’s Commission on Implementation of the United States
Space  Exploration  Policy,  led  by  E.C.  ‘‘Pete’’  Aldridge,  Jr.  (the  Aldridge  Commis-
sion),  reported  its  findings  and  recommendations  to  the  President.  The  Aldridge
Commission emphasized the crucial role that technological innovation, national and
international  partnerships,  and  organizational  transformation  must  play  if  we  are
to  implement  the  President’s  Vision  for  an  affordable  and  sustainable  space  explo-
ration  program.  NASA  is  committed  to  making  the  necessary  transformation  to  en-
sure our success in achieving the Vision.

The President demonstrated his commitment to the Vision by making it a priority
in  his  FY  2005  budget  request,  and  Congress  responded  positively  by  providing
funding  for  NASA  at  the  level  requested  by  the  President.  The  President  has  re-
affirmed  his  commitment  to  the  Vision  by  also  making  it  a  priority  in  his  FY  2006
budget request. The $16.46 billion requested for NASA is an increase of 2.4 percent
over FY 2005 in a very challenging budget environment.
Exploration Vision is Well Underway

Over the past year, NASA has made great strides in implementing the Vision:

• Returning to Flight—We are making final preparations for Shuttle return-to-
flight as early as May 2005 and Space Station is entering its fifth year of con-
tinuous presence on-orbit.
• Exploring Our Solar System and the Universe—The Mars twin rovers are ex-
ceeding  all  expectations  and  making  unprecedented  discoveries;  the  Cassini/
Huygens  mission  is  providing  stunning  views  of  Saturn  and  Titan;  the  Gen-

esis mission has returned primordial samples from space; new missions have
been  launched  to  Mercury  and  comets;  amazing  discoveries  continue  with
Hubble,  Chandra  and  Spitzer;  and  we  have  completed  deployment  of  the
Earth Observing System.

• Laying  the  Groundwork  for  the  Future—We  have  had  overwhelming  interest
in  our  exploration  efforts  with  5,000  letters  of  interest,  600  proposals  sub-
mitted,  and  competitive  awards  of  118  contracts  for  exploration  technologies.
Also, initial contracts have been awarded as we prepare for major milestones
in 2008 including an unprecedented mapping of the Moon with the Lunar Re-
connaissance  Orbiter,  and  a  technology  demonstration  flight  of  the  Crew  Ex-
ploration Vehicle, and a planned ground-based nuclear reactor test for Project
Prometheus.

• Engaging the Public—All of these accomplishments have created even greater
excitement  for  space  exploration  since  the  President’s  announcement  of  the
Vision.  Indeed,  the  incredible  17  billion  hits  on  NASA  web  site  over  the  past
year is a testament to the intense public interest.

Funding Based on Long-Term Affordability

In  his  February  2nd  State  of  the  Union  Address,  the  President  underscored  the
need  to  restrain  spending  in  order  to  sustain  our  economic  prosperity.  As  part  of
this  restraint,  it  is  important  that  total  discretionary  and  non-security  spending  be
held  to  levels  proposed  in  the  FY  2006  Budget.  The  budget  savings  and  reforms  in
the  Budget  are  important  components  of  achieving  the  President’s  goal  of  cutting
the  budget  deficit  in  half  by  2009  and  we  urge  the  Congress  to  support  these  re-
forms. The FY 2006 Budget includes more than 150 reductions, reforms, and termi-
nations  in  non-defense  discretionary  programs,  of  which  three  affect  NASA  pro-
grams. The Agency wants to work with the Congress to achieve these savings.

To  achieve  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  NASA  is  proceeding,  as  directed  by
the  President,  to  plan  and  implement  a  sustainable  and  affordable,  integrated
robotic  and  human  exploration  program,  structured  with  measurable  milestones,
and executed on the basis of available resources, accumulated experience, and tech-
nology readiness. NASA views human and robotic explorers as partners in achieving
the  Vision.  Last  year,  we  provided  a  long-range  roadmap  through  2020  to  address
how such human and robotic exploration would remain affordable:

• Human explorers would return to the Moon no later than 2020 based on inno-
vative new designs that would be developed in ever increasing capabilities or
‘‘spirals.’’  Major  development  of  these  hardware  elements  would  commence
later  this  decade,  given  the  retirement  of  the  Space  Shuttle  in  2010.  These
exploration  elements  would  include  needed  launch  vehicles,  in-space  transfer
systems, lunar landers and habitation systems, and a Crew Exploration Vehi-
cle  (CEV)  that  would  ferry  humans  from  Earth  to  the  Moon  and  beyond.  To
prepare for development decisions of these elements, we would use the inter-
vening  years  focusing  on  critical  research  and  technology  (R&T).  Such  R&T
would  encourage  new  innovations,  and  ensure  development  decisions  that
could deliver hardware at the promised cost and performance. Funding for the
R&T  this  decade  was  largely  achieved  by  terminating  legacy  human  space
flight  projects,  such  as  canceling  the  Space  Launch  Initiative  in  last  year’s
budget,  and  focusing  existing  R&T  investments  on  exploration  requirements.
• Robotic  explorers  would  continue  the  exploration  of  the  solar  system,  trav-
eling  to  places  like  Mars  in  anticipation  of  eventual  human  visits,  and  going
to  destinations  that  are  more  challenging,  like  Mercury,  Saturn,  Pluto,  and
comets. Observatories would be deployed to search for Earth-like planets and
habitable  environments  around  distant  stars,  and  to  explore  the  universe  to
understand  its  origin,  structure,  evolution,  and  destiny.  Funding  for  these
areas would significantly increase over the coming years with Science invest-
ments growing from 33 percent to 38 percent of the Agency’s total budget.

These  human  and  robotic  explorers  will  enable  our  exploration  and  scientific
plans.  A  recent  report  released  on  February  3,  2005,  by  the  National  Research
Council entitled Science in NASA’s Vision for Space Exploration states, ‘‘Exploration
is  a  key  step  in  the  search  for  fundamental  and  systematic  understanding  of  the
universe  around  us.  Exploration  done  properly  is  a  form  of  science.  Both  robotic
spacecraft and human space flight should be used to fulfill scientific roles in NASA’s
mission to explore.’’

Guided by Our Priorities

30

Indeed,  the  President’s  FY  2006  budget  request  for  NASA  reaffirms  the  funding
strategy  outlined  above.  The  FY  2006  budget  identifies  what  is  needed  to  proceed
with  the  transformation  of  America’s  civil  space  program.  It  maintains  resolute
focus  on  key  priorities,  milestones,  and  schedules  for  the  Vision  introduced  in  the
FY 2005 budget:

added in 2011;

Space Station assembly;

ration Vehicle flight demonstration;

including a planned flight demonstration in a decade;

• First  Step—Space  Shuttle  return-to-flight  and  completion  of  International
• Flagship  Program—Constellation  Systems  including  the  2008  Crew  Explo-
• Technology Base—Critical exploration technologies;
• Transforming  Technologies—Prometheus  Nuclear  Systems  and  Technology,
• Robotic  Precursors—Lunar  missions  beginning  in  2008  and  Mars  missions
• Shuttle Transition—Space Station cargo and crew services via near-term com-
• Scientific  Breakthroughs—Exploration  of  the  solar  system  and  the  universe,
such  as  the  James  Webb  Space  Telescope  launch  in  2011  and  the  search  for
Earth-like planets.

mercial services and Shuttle retirement in 2010;

The FY 2006 budget also supports critical national needs in other areas:

• Aeronautics—Protecting  priorities  in  aviation  safety,  security  and  airspace
systems  and  focusing  on  high-payoff,  ‘‘barrier-breaking’’  technology  dem-
onstration projects;
• Climate  Change—Supporting  investments  in  the  Global  Change  Science  and
• Education—Continuing  to  inspire  the  next  generation  of  explorers  with  pro-

Technology Program and the next generation Earth observing satellites;

grams like Explorer schools and scholarship for service.

To  support  the  Administration’s  goal  of  reducing  the  deficit,  NASA’s  budget  was
reduced  $0.5  billion  in  FY  2006  below  the  level  planned  last  year  for  FY  2006.  In
addition,  returning  the  Shuttle  safely  to  flight  costs  $0.4  billion  more  than  pre-
viously  estimated  in  FY  2006.  To  address  these  and  other  items  the  net  result  was
$0.4 billion (11 percent) less in Exploration Systems than previously planned for FY
2006, $0.3 billion (five percent) less in Science, $0.1 billion (11 percent) less in Aero-
nautics,  and  $0.2  billion  (four  percent)  more  in  Space  Operations.  These  changes
were  not  easy  but,  in  the  end,  we  made  the  tough  decisions  while  protecting  the
priorities outlined above.

On  December  21,  2004,  the  President  signed  a  new  national  policy  directive  that
establishes guidelines and implementation actions for United States space transpor-
tation programs and activities to ensure the Nation’s continued ability to access and
use  space  for  national  and  homeland  security,  and  civil,  scientific,  and  commercial
purposes. NASA will play a significant role in implementing this directive, fostering
and  enabling  the  development  of  space  transportation  capabilities  for  human  space
exploration beyond low-Earth orbit, consistent with the goals of the Vision for Space
Exploration.
Building on Our Scientific Successes

The  FY  2006  budget  request  of  $5.5  billion  for  the  Science  Mission  Directorate
will  support  55  missions  in  orbit,  26  in  development,  and  34  in  design  phase.  By
2010, the Science budget will increase by 23 percent over current levels.

The  FY  2006  budget  includes  $858  million  (a  17  percent  increase)  for  Mars  and
Lunar  robotic  exploration.  The  Mars  rovers,  Spirit  and  Opportunity,  are  exceeding
all  goals  with  their  unprecedented  discoveries  and  longevity.  Last  year,  they  found
definitive evidence of an ancient body of water on the Red Planet, and they continue
to gather data more than a year after their successful landing. We recently awarded
contracts for six instruments to be flown on the 2008 Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter
(LRO)  that  promises  unprecedented  mapping  of  the  Moon’s  surface.  The  2008  LRO
should  revolutionize  our  understanding  of  the  Moon  to  the  same  extent  that  the
Mars rovers have transformed our understanding of Mars.

The  budget  also  includes  $218  million  to  maintain  competitive  efforts  for  the  Ex-
plorer Program, $56 million (a 33 percent increase) for the Beyond Einstein program
to  study  the  universe,  $234  million  for  studying  the  Sun  in  the  Living  With  a  Star
program,  and  $136  million  (a  six  percent  increase)  for  competitive  opportunities  in
the Earth System Science Pathfinder program. With our international partners, we

31

also  continue  to  add  to  the  constellation  of  Earth-observing  satellites  that  monitor
our  planet  while  extending  our  reach  and  presence  further  into  the  solar  system.
We launched Aura to look back at Earth and give us a better picture of our atmos-
phere  and  changing  climate,  and  the  entire  Earth  Observing  System  continues  to
return  trillions  of  bytes  of  information  about  our  dynamic  Earth.  In  the  future,
NASA plans to develop a ‘‘sensor-web’’ to provide timely, on-demand data and anal-
ysis  to  users  who  can  enable  practical  benefits  for  scientific  research,  national  pol-
icy-making,  economic  growth,  natural  hazard  mitigation,  and  the  exploration  of
other planets in this solar system and beyond.

NASA  will  continue  to  expand  our  exploration  reach  with  an  armada  of  existing
and  new  space  observatories  operating  in  many  different  wavelengths  and  looking
at  different  parts  of  our  exotic  universe.  The  three  ‘‘Great  Observatories’’—Hubble,
Spitzer and Chandra—will continue to bring wondrous images to our eyes and excit-
ing  new  scientific  discoveries  while  we  continue  development  of  new  tools  for  re-
search like the James Webb Space Telescope and the Space Interferometry Mission
that  will  vastly  expand  our  understanding  of  the  origin  and  evolution  of  the  uni-
verse.  Missions  such  as  Kepler  will  provide  a  new  understanding  and  knowledge  of
the planets orbiting stars far from our solar system, perhaps identifying new targets
for voyages of exploration by future generations of explorers.

This  budget  also  includes  $372  million  (a  19  percent  increase)  to  maintain  the
Webb telescope on pace for a 2011 launch and $93 million in development funds for
the Hubble Space Telescope to extend its scientific productivity and initiate a robotic
mission to safely de-orbit it. This investment in the Hubble, together with the syner-
gistic  use  of  the  other  two  Great  Observatories  and  combined  with  the  greatly  in-
creased  capability  of  ground-based  assets  and  the  emergent  science  of  optical
interferometry,  will  ensure  many  years  of  new  scientific  discoveries  for  the  Nation.
NASA  decided  to  discontinue  the  effort  on  robotic  servicing  of  the  Hubble  Space
Telescope, and, based on analysis of the relative risks, not to proceed with a Shuttle
servicing  mission.  The  Hubble  will  complete  its  originally  planned  15-year  mission
this  year  and,  with  careful  stewardship,  should  continue  to  operate  for  2–3  addi-
tional years until its gyroscopes and batteries wear out. As it ages, other items may
unexpectedly  fail,  such  as  the  recent  loss  of  one  of  the  four  scientific  instruments,
the  Space  Telescope  Imaging  Spectrograph  (STIS).  NASA’s  decision  not  to  service
the Hubble was a very difficult one given the Hubble’s spectacular successes. None-
theless, although the spacecraft may have limited lifetime, NASA is fully committed
to saving the associated science. NASA’s FY 2006 budget request is consistent with
redirecting the HST effort to:

(1) Operate  Hubble  as  long  as  the  spacecraft  generates  useful  scientific  data;
(2) Develop techniques to extend its life;
(3) Safely de-orbit the spacecraft after the end of Hubble’s useful life;
(4) Examine options for addressing some Hubble science such as re-hosting new

or modified Hubble instruments on new space platforms;

(5) Continue analysis of the archived data generated by Hubble; and
(6) Aggressively  pursue  development  of  the  James  Webb  Space  Telescope,

which promises an exciting future of continued discovery.

Even  though  the  Columbia  accident  has  compelled  NASA  to  change  its  plans  for
the  Hubble  Telescope,  NASA  remains  committed  to  our  world-class  program  of  as-
tronomy.
Preparing for Our Exploration Future

The  FY  2006  budget  request  of  $3.2  billion  for  the  Exploration  Systems  Mission
Directorate  includes  $753  million  for  continuing  development  of  the  Crew  Explo-
ration  Vehicle,  America’s  future  spacecraft  for  safe  and  affordable  human  explo-
ration, scheduled for a flight demonstration in 2008. The CEV promises safer travel
for  astronauts  into  space  and  continuing  U.S.  human  access  soon  after  retirement
of  the  Shuttle.  The  CEV  as  well  as  launch  vehicles  for  transport  of  the  CEV  and
cargo to low-Earth orbit, and any ground or in-space support infrastructure for com-
munications  and  operations,  is  collectively  known  as  the  ‘‘System  of  Systems.’’  This
will  be  developed  in  a  ‘‘spiral’’  approach,  wherein  early  demonstrations  and  proto-
types are used to demonstrate capabilities, validate technologies, and mitigate risk,
all along an evolutionary path toward a mature design. The first spiral development
planned  will  provide  the  capability  to  deliver  humans  to  orbit  in  a  CEV  by  2014.
The second spiral will deliver humans to the lunar surface by 2020, followed by the
third spiral that will enable extended visits on the lunar surface. As spiral develop-
ment evolves, System of Systems elements will grow to include in-space support sys-
tems,  destination  surface  systems,  and  additional  human  support  systems.  NASA

will be assessing design options for the Crew Exploration Vehicle, including the abil-
ity to dock with the International Space Station.

The FY 2006 budget request includes $919 million (a 27 percent increase) for Ex-
ploration Systems Research and Technology that will enable designs for sustainable
exploration,  including  $34  million  for  a  revamped  technology  transfer  program  and
$34  million  for  the  Centennial  Challenges  prize  program.  The  Agency  seeks  the
Committee’s  support  in  providing  the  authorization  language  to  enable  larger  prize
awards.  This  budget  also  includes  $320  million  for  Prometheus  Nuclear  Systems
and  Technology  to  support  a  new  flight  demonstration  that  is  less  risky  and  more
affordable  than  the  Jupiter  Icy  Moons  Orbiter  mission.  In  addition,  the  FY  2006
budget request provides $806 million for Human Systems Research and Technology
which  has  been  restructured  so  its  programs  are  now  linked  directly  to  exploration
requirements for human missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.
Enabling Breakthrough Aeronautics Research

The President’s FY 2006 Budget fully supports the Aeronautics program’s vital re-
search especially in the areas of emissions and noise reduction, increasing the Avia-
tion  safety  and  security,  and  increasing  the  capacity  and  efficiency  of  the  National
Airspace  System.  The  budget  request  also  supports  the  critical  research  activities
that have been identified by the Joint Program and Development Office. NASA’s FY
2006 request for the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate is $852 million. The
President’s  FY  2006  budget  increases  the  Aeronautics  program’s  vital  research  in
Aviation  Safety  and  Security  by  four  percent  and  Airspace  Systems  by  32  percent.
These  two  priority  programs  are  fully  funded  to  ensure  timely  results  critical  to
meeting  national  goals,  especially  those  efforts  in  support  of  the  interagency  Joint
Planning and Development Office (JPDO). This is a consortium of government agen-
cies,  of  which  NASA  is  a  principal  member,  chartered  to  transform  the  U.S.  air
transportation system by the year 2025.

Participants include Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Commerce, and

Transportation.

To  ensure  maximum  benefit  to  the  taxpayer,  we  are  transforming  part  of  our  in-
vestment in Aeronautics Research in order to more sharply focus the investment on
breakthrough  technologies.  Toward  this  end,  the  NASA  Aeronautics  Vehicle  Sys-
tems  Program  has  been  restructured  from  the  current  emphasis  on  numerous
projects  aimed  at  incremental  improvements.  Instead,  the  program  is  moving  to-
wards a smaller and more focused set of four projects seeking to achieve near-term
flight demonstrations of revolutionary and barrier breaking technology: (1) reducing
the  noise  of  conventional  aircraft  to  within  the  airport  boundary,  (2)  reducing  the
supersonic boom allowing future supersonic aircraft to fly over land without the re-
strictions  in  place  today,  (3)  developing  electric  propulsion  systems  for  aircraft  that
eliminate  pollution  entirely  because  they  do  not  burn  hydrocarbon  fuels,  and  (4)
demonstrating high altitude, long endurance, remotely operated or autonomous air-
craft to create opportunities for new applications including scientific platforms. The
$459 million program request for FY 2006 will fully fund these four projects. In con-
cert with the Agency transformation, this program will be conducted using a higher
level  of  competitively  awarded  research.  We  believe  that  this  new  focus  and  new
way  of  performing  the  research  will  enhance  the  value  of  our  vehicle  research  to
the taxpayer.
Meeting Our Obligations

The  FY  2006  budget  request  of  $6.8  billion  for  the  Space  Operations  Mission  Di-
rectorate  reflects  the  first  step  in  the  Vision:  returning  the  Space  Shuttle  safely  to
flight and resuming flight operations. The budget includes $4.5 billion to return the
Shuttle  safely  to  flight  and  maintain  safe  operations  in  support  of  five  planned
flights.  NASA  will  retire  the  Space  Shuttle  in  2010.  The  FY  2006  budget  also  pro-
vides $1.9 billion for the International Space Station. NASA currently is examining
configurations for the Space Station that meet the needs of the Vision for Space Ex-
ploration  and  our  international  partners  and  require  as  few  Shuttle  flights  as  pos-
sible  to  complete  assembly.  A  key  element  in  the  future  of  the  International  Space
Station program is the purchase of alternate cargo and crew transportation services
to  supplement  the  Shuttle  when  it  is  in  service,  and  to  replace  it  when  it  retires.
The  budget  provides  $160  million  for  these  services  in  2006  and  NASA  intends  to
solicit  a  Request  for  Proposal  for  commercial  cargo  transportation  services  to  the
Station this summer.

We  are  making  final  preparations  to  return  the  Space  Shuttle  safely  to  flight  in
2005. We have made more than 100 major maintenance modifications and upgrades
to Discovery and its supporting systems, including new cabling and wiring that will
support  leading  edge  sensors,  a  digital  camera,  and  a  boom  extension  for  the  Shut-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

tle’s  robotic  arm  that  will  enable  us  to  inspect  nearly  all  the  outside  areas  of  the
orbiter’s Thermal Protection System during missions. Technicians installed the For-
ward Reaction Control System and the Reinforced Carbon-Carbon Nose Cap, and 88
sensors  are  being  installed  on  each  wing;  66  will  measure  acceleration  and  impact
data, and 22 will take temperature data during Discovery’s journey. Overall, we are
making  excellent  progress  on  the  milestones  toward  a  launch.  The  return  of  the
Shuttle  to  flight  is  a  key  milestone  and  we  are  committed  to  keeping  human  space
flight as safe as possible.

As  the  United  States  implements  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  the  Adminis-
tration recognizes the value of effective cooperation with Russia to further our space
exploration  goals.  At  the  same  time,  we  have  to  appropriately  reflect  U.S.  non-
proliferation  policy  and  objectives  in  our  relationship  with  Russia.  The  Administra-
tion is thus interested in seeking a balanced approach that continues to protect our
nonproliferation  goals  while  advancing  potential  U.S.  cooperation  with  Russia  on
the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration.  Such  a  balanced  approach  must  include  the  Iran
Nonproliferation  Act  of  2000  (INA),  which  currently  complicates  cooperation  with
Russia  on  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS),  and  will  also  have  an  adverse  im-
pact  on  cooperation  with  Russia  on  our  future  space  exploration  efforts  related  to
human space flight. To that end, the Administration looks forward to working with
Congress  to  ensure  that  the  Vision  for  U.S.  Space  Exploration  is  able  to  succeed
while  remaining  fully  consistent  with  broader  U.S.  national  security  and  non-
proliferation goals.

This year, we began our fifth year of continuous astronaut presence on the Space
Station.  Astronauts  continued  their  international  cooperation  on-board  the  Station
through  a  variety  of  joint  research  activities.  Just  last  month,  agency  leaders  from
the  U.S.,  Russia,  Japan,  Europe,  and  Canada  met  in  Montreal,  Canada  to  discuss
Station cooperative activities. At the meeting, the Station partnership unanimously
endorsed completion of this orbiting laboratory by the end of the decade.
Building the Pipeline for Future Careers

The  FY  2006  budget  request  of  $167  million  for  the  Office  of  Education  reflects
NASA’s continued commitment to developing the next generation of explorers by in-
spiring and motivating students and educators at all levels in the formal and infor-
mal  education  communities  to  pursue  careers  in  science,  technology,  engineering,
and mathematics. We will achieve this goal by providing unique teaching and learn-
ing  experiences,  as  only  NASA  can,  through  the  Agency’s  research  and  flight  mis-
sions.  Students  and  educators  will  be  able  to  work  with  NASA  and  university  sci-
entists  to  use  real  data  to  study  Earth,  explore  Mars,  and  conduct  scientific  inves-
tigations.  They  will  work  with  NASA  engineers  to  learn  what  it  takes  to  develop
technological  breakthroughs  required  to  reach  the  farthest  regions  of  the  solar  sys-
tem and to live and work in space. To ensure diversity in NASA’s future workforce,
the education programs pay particular attention to under-represented groups. NASA
will  continue  to  support  the  Nation’s  universities  to  educate  more  students  in
science and engineering by providing meaningful research and internship opportuni-
ties for qualified students, plus a roadmap for students seeking NASA careers. The
FY  2006  budget  continues  emphasis  on  priority  initiatives:  NASA  Educator  Astro-
naut,  NASA  Explorer  Schools,  NASA  Explorer  Institutes,  and  Science  and  Tech-
nology Scholarship Program. Exploration advances knowledge.
The Vision is Transforming NASA

To  achieve  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  NASA  is  engaged  in  a  major  trans-
formation—taking  the  extraordinary  capabilities  we  have  throughout  the  Agency
and  restructuring  them  to  achieve  the  goals  of  the  21st  century.  This  is  an  enor-
mous challenge, but in less than a year, we have begun to transform our entire or-
ganization  to  foster  permanent  change  and  making  a  positive,  mission-driven  cul-
ture.  We  are  creating  an  environment  of  openness  and  free-flowing  communication
by  continuing  to  assess  our  leadership  practices.  We  also  are  sure  that  the  entire
NASA family is headed in the same direction.

The focus of the transformed NASA is on how best to achieve the Vision and other
national priorities assigned to our Agency. Guided by NASA’s core values of Safety,
the NASA Family, Excellence, and Integrity, the Agency’s transformation is:

• Embedding  a  Safety  Culture—NASA  is  continuing  to  foster  its  safety  culture
throughout  the  organization.  The  Agency  has  reduced  workforce  accident
rates  to  industrial  world-class  standards  and  implemented  an  Independent
Technical Authority (ITA) and NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC)
to guide NASA’s continued safety improvements. NASA’s FY 2006 budget as-
sumes  $87  million  in  Center  service  pool  budgets  to  support  the  ITA  func-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

34

tions.  The  budget  also  includes  $79  million  for  the  NESC  (a  21  percent  in-
crease).
• Embracing  Competition—NASA  is  embracing  competition  as  a  way  to  elicit
the  best  from  the  NASA’s  Centers,  industry,  and  academia.  The  Agency  is
using  competitive  processes  to  encourage  more  cost-effective,  innovative  solu-
tions  to  the  scientific  and  technical  challenges  presented  by  the  Vision.  Over
the  past  year,  competitive  selections  in  exploration  have  demonstrated  in-
creased  collaboration  between  NASA’s  Centers  and  industry  and  academia.
The  budget  provides  well  over  $10  billion  in  new  competitive  opportunities
over the next five years.
• Enhancing  Strategic  Planning—In  a  new  document  released  with  our  FY
2006 budget request, The New Age of Exploration: NASA’s Direction for 2005
and  Beyond,  we  outline  NASA’s  commitment  to  change  and  to  achieving  the
Vision.  This  document  establishes  NASA’s  long-  and  short-term  objectives,
supports our re-mapped FY 2005 Performance Plan, and underpins the struc-
ture and strategy of our FY 2006 budget. NASA’s 2006 Strategic Plan—to be
released  next  February  with  the  FY  2007  budget  request—will  be  informed
by  the  strategic  and  capability  roadmaps  currently  being  developed  by  na-
tional  teams  of  experts  from  academia,  industry,  other  government  agencies,
and NASA.
• Improving  Decision-making—Our  transformed  headquarters  organization  in-
cludes a Strategic Planning Council and a supporting Advanced Planning and
Integration  Office  to  enable  better  long-range  planning,  an  Operations  Coun-
cil  to  integrate  NASA’s  tactical  and  operational  decisions,  and  a  transformed
NASA  Advisory  Council  to  integrate  Agency  activities.  We  have  streamlined
our corporate structure by reducing the number of headquarters organizations
by half to four Mission Directorates and eight Mission Support Offices.
• Reinvigorating  Field  Centers—NASA  has  identified  Core  Competencies,  in-
volving  human  capital  and  physical  assets,  which  must  be  sustained  within
NASA in order for the Agency’s mission to be achieved. These specific Organi-
zational  Core  Competencies  are  resident  at  one  or  more  NASA  Centers  and
funded  primarily  through  competitive  means.  Every  three  years,  these  Com-
petencies will be assessed as a part of the Agency’s strategic planning process,
and may be changed in response to changing mission requirements, emerging
commercial capabilities, and/or competitive results. NASA’s Centers will build
long-term business plans based on the Vision for Space Exploration, strength-
en  institutional  capabilities  around  Core  Competencies,  and  remain  at  the
cutting edge through competitive opportunities. NASA Centers will also be ex-
amining alternative management structures to enhance organizational agility
and to foster new business opportunities.
• Transforming Human and Physical Capital —As NASA sets its sights on ex-
citing  worlds  beyond,  NASA  will  require  a  workforce  and  facilities  with  the
right  mix  of  world-class  capabilities.  The  Agency  is  actively  engaged  in  a
multi-faceted  approach  to  shape  the  workforce  of  the  future,  and  to  align  it
physical  assets  in  support  of  current  and  future  mission  needs.  The  need  to
reshape workforce and align physical assets is not a new challenge for NASA,
but  with  the  Vision  we  are  now  provided  the  necessary  long-term  direction
to  guide  the  transformation.  In  response  to  all  these  challenges,  NASA  will
use 2005-2006 as a transition period for Centers to reshape and rebalance its
workforce  and  facilities.  The  Agency  is  undertaking  a  number  of  targeted
workforce  activities  to  ensure  the  relevant  skills  are  available  to  accomplish
the  mission.  Additionally,  it  is  taking  steps  to  identify  underutilized  infra-
structure  that  could  possibly  be  replaced  with  state-of-the-art  facilities  pro-
viding greater utility or a lower cost burden to the Centers. Before closing any
facilities,  NASA  will  be  coordinating  with  other  users  and  government  agen-
cies  to  determine  the  demand  for  underutilized  facilities.  In  the  near  future,
NASA will be proposing a set of legislative initiatives as part of the Agency’s
draft Authorization Bill that will enhance the Agency’s transformation in sup-
port of the Vision.
• Implementing Improved Program Management Procedures—The Agency is im-
plementing  improved  cost  estimating  and  earned  value  management  proce-
dures  to  ensure  we  meet  our  cost  commitments.  We  are  also  establishing  an
acquisition  strategy  approval  process  that  will  draw  on  the  best  processes
from  the  Department  of  Defense  and  prior  NASA  acquisition  policies.  This  is
to  ensure  that  before  contract  award,  all  acquisition  programs  and  projects
will  satisfy  the  requirements  and  that  the  acquisition  strategies,  if  done  as

35

planned,  are  executable,  have  exit  and  entrance  criteria,  contain  clear  ap-
proval milestones, and involve independent reviews.
• Improving  Financial  Management—For  the  past  two  years,  NASA  has  re-
ceived  a  disclaimer  of  audit  opinion  on  its  annual  financial  statements  due
largely  to  two  issues—financial  system  conversion,  and  accounting  for  prop-
erty,  plant  and  equipment,  and  materials  and  supplies.  In  FY  2003  NASA
converted  the  10  separate  NASA  Center  accounting  systems  and  the  associ-
ated  120  subsidiary  systems,  along  with  over  12  years  of  historical  financial
data,  into  one  single  integrated  agency-wide  core  accounting  system.  Prob-
lems associated with this conversion have been greater than expected and are
taking longer than expected to correct. Accounting for property and materials
and  supplies  valued  at  $37.6  billion  (83  percent  of  NASA’s  assets  on  the  bal-
ance sheet) lacks the necessary internal controls and systems to support valu-
ation  for  management  and  audit  purposes.  NASA  understands  the  serious-
ness  of  these  issues  and  has  developed  work  plans  to  overcome  these  and
other material issues, however it will take time to implement all of the correc-
tive  actions.  NASA  anticipates  that  improved  audit  results  could  be  achieved
on the FY 2006 financial statements with a reduction in the number of mate-
rial weaknesses and reportable conditions.

The Nation’s Future in Exploration and Discovery

The  torch  is  being  passed  from  the  pioneers,  who  first  took  us  to  the  Moon  and
beyond, to the new generation of explorers who will take us into deep space to stay.
A  new  era  in  space  exploration  begins  with  the  return-to-flight  of  the  Shuttle  and
the  completion  of  the  International  Space  Station,  as  we  begin  a  journey  that  will
take  the  next  generation  of  Americans  back  to  the  Moon,  to  Mars,  and  beyond.  We
will  also  be  pursuing  ever  more  aggressive  plans  with  advanced  robots  and  space
observatories that will require this nation’s most sophisticated technical capabilities.
This generation inherited great legacies from the exploratory voyages and discov-
eries  of  earlier  centuries.  It  is  our  responsibility  to  ensure  that  future  generations
inherit  from  our  journey  a  similar  legacy  of  achievement  and  inspiration.  Imple-
menting  the  Vision  will  provide  this  legacy.  The  FY  2006  NASA  budget  reaffirms
the  President’s  commitment  and  allows  us  to  take  the  next  step  in  implementing

As President George W. Bush said, ‘‘We choose to explore space because doing so

improves our lives and lifts our national spirit. So let us continue the journey.’’

BIOGRAPHY FOR FREDERICK D. GREGORY

Frederick D. Gregory is the Deputy Administrator of NASA. He assumed this po-
sition in August 2002. He serves as the Chief Operating Officer for the Agency and
reports  directly  to  NASA’s  Administrator.  He  is  responsible  for  directing  and  man-

DISCUSSION

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Gregory,  and
let  me  tell  you,  this  committee,  on  a  bipartisan  basis,  was  privi-
leged  and  proud  to  work  with  you  and  all  at  NASA  to  get  that
Workforce  Flexibility  Act  in  place,  to  give  you  the  flexibility  you
need  to  treat  your  staff  the  way  it  should  be  treated,  as  very  able
professionals.

As I mentioned in my opening statement, there are a lot of ques-
tions  NASA  can’t  answer  yet.  And  I  understand  that.  I  am  going
to  go  through  a  list  of  nine  items,  and  for  each  of  them,  I  would
like  to  know  when  NASA  will  be  able  to  give  Congress  an  answer
to the question. It would be helpful to know a month, but a season
will do. I will stop after each item.

ISS RESEARCH

First question. The research agenda for the Space Station.
Mr. GREGORY. I would say that the research agenda, at least the
first  part  of  it,  should  be  available  at  the  end  of  this  month,  or
early  in  March,  but  if  it  is  okay  with  you,  let  me  ask  Mr.  Craig
Steidle, who is responsible for that, to give you——

Chairman BOEHLERT. Admiral.
Mr. GREGORY.—a more definitive answer.
Admiral STEIDLE. Yes, sir. Thank you.
We will complete the assessment that we have under way by the
28th of February, and I will give it to Bill Readdy, who—and then
together,  we  will  put  it  together,  and  have  a  completion  of  that
study at the end of April.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much.  Next  question.
Whether the Space Station will be reconfigured once again, wheth-
er we will bring up the centrifuge.

Mr. GREGORY. The—about three weeks ago, we had the privilege
of meeting in Montreal with the heads of agency, that would be the
Sean O’Keefe equivalent in Japan, Canada, Europe, and Russia.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Or the Fred Gregory equivalent, come Sun-

day.

Mr.  GREGORY.  Thank  you,  sir.  I  have  had  the  privilege  of
chairing  something  called  the  Multilateral  Coordination  Board,
which  is  the  board  just  down  from—the  representatives  just  down
from the top. During that session, we looked at the, and agreed to,
the final configuration of the International Space Station. We made
a recommendation to the heads of agency, which they accepted.

As  part  of  that  configuration,  we  looked  at  the  assembly  se-
quence,  and  we  looked  at  the  number  of  flights  that  could  accom-
plish  that  configuration.  At  the  same  time,  however,  with  the
change  in—with  the  identified  focus  that  we  have  now,  as  part  of
the  Exploration  Vision,  we  also  held  open  the  opportunity  to  re-
evaluate  the  components  that  we  will  have  on  the  International
Space  Station.  This  was  very  openly  addressed  with  the  inter-
national partners, and each has taken upon themselves, and given
themselves  the  opportunity  re-look  at  what  they  are—what  they
would have on the Space Station.

We,  of  course,  are  focused  toward  the  Exploration  Vision.  It  is  a
requirement-driven  activity  that  we  have,  as  we  assess  each  and
every piece and component, as it prepares us to take the next step.
Chairman BOEHLERT. So when will we be enlightened? A season,

Mr.  GREGORY.  Well,  Admiral  Steidle  gave  you  that  answer  just
a  moment  ago.  He  said  that  they  would  report  out  at  the  end  of
February,  and  that  probably  by  the  end  of  April,  all  of  us  will
know, sir.

at least?

REMAINING SHUTTLE FLIGHTS

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Okay.  The  number  of  remaining  Shuttle

flights planned.

Mr. GREGORY. The—at this moment, we are looking at a number
that  is  around  28.  But  as  I  said  earlier,  what  we  are  looking  at  is
the  fewest  number  of  flights  necessary  to  complete  the  Inter-
national  Space  Station  with  its  requirements  by  December  31,
2010, as you mentioned.

But let me have Bill Readdy give you his opinion.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Readdy.
Mr. READDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 28 flights is the baseline
manifest, as agreed to by the international partners, but as a result
of  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  we  are  taking  a  very  critical
look at that, and what components will be flown, and as Mr. Greg-
ory  and  Admiral  Steidle  both  said,  by  the  end  of  April,  we  should
have  a  little  bit  more  clarity  in  terms  of  perhaps  some  of  the  con-
tent for that.

We don’t want to use the Space Shuttle for any more flights than
we  have  to,  where  its  unique  capabilities  to  carry  modules  to  the
International  Space  Station,  to  support  spacewalks,  to  support
robotic  operations,  and  crew  transfer,  and  logistics.  We  don’t  want
to  use  that  for  any  more  flights  than  we  have  to  to  complete  our
obligations.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much.  So  by  the  end  of

April, we can expect something more definitive?

Mr. READDY. In terms of the centrifuge, that is correct, sir.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

38

Chairman BOEHLERT. And what about the number of flights?
Mr.  READDY.  The  number  of  flights  will  be  an  iterative  process
with  our  international  partners  and  ourselves,  as  we  assess  what
our exploration goals are, and as they assess what their exploration
goals  are.  So  expect—that  will  be  a  continuing  dialogue,  but  the
first  step  in  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  of  course,  is  return-
ing  the  Space  Shuttle  safely  to  flight,  and  we  are  very  focused  on
doing that right now in late Spring.

Chairman BOEHLERT. So it is still an open question on the num-

ber of flights, as you point out.

Mr.  READDY.  Yes,  sir.  I  think  it  will  be  an  open  question,  and  it
will  certainly  be  dependent  on  how  we  fare  with  return-to-flight,
and  the  remainder  of  the  flights  this  year,  and  input  that  we  get
from the international partners.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, let us go on down to the manifest for
the  Shuttle  flights.  That  is,  which  flight  will  conduct  which  mis-
sion? Has that been determined yet?

Mr. READDY. Yes, sir. At least in the baseline manifest, each and
every  one  of  those  28  flights  has  been  laid  out,  with  specific  mis-
sion objectives, and that is how we pared it down initially, to meet
our  international  commitments.  We  are  assessing  each  and  every
one  of  those  flights,  and  General  Kostelnik  and  his  Space  Station
Deputy,  Mark  Uhran,  and 
the  Program  Manager,  Bill
Gerstenmaier,  are  looking  at  all  of  those  flights  to  see  which  ones
are uniquely requiring the Space Shuttle as a launch capability.

As  you  know,  we  are  also  looking  at  commercial  crew  and  cargo
to  the  International  Space  Station  this  fiscal  year.  We  look  for  the
opportunity to be able to provide logistics with other than Shuttle,
certainly  after  it  is  retired  at  the  end  of  this  decade,  but  to  that
end, this summer, we expect to have a request for proposal issued,
and  then  by  the  end  of  this  calendar  year,  we  expect  to  start
issuing contracts to that end.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Whether NASA will have to lay off employ-

ees this year or next. Mr. Gregory.

Mr.  GREGORY.  The  answer  to  that  is  very  clear,  and  that  is  be-
tween now—this year and next, there will be no employees laid off.
We have adequate budget to cover all salaries for the next year and
a  half  or  so,  or  the  next  two  years.  During  that  time,  we  will  be
assessing,  in  a  very  deliberate  way,  based  on  the  Vision  that  we
have,  the  kind  of  requirements  that  we  have,  and  the  kind  of  re-
sources  that  will  be  necessary,  and  that  includes  people  and  facili-
ties and capabilities, sir.

PROJECT PROMETHEUS

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  What  mission  will  be  used  as  a  test  for

Project Prometheus?

Mr. GREGORY. Craig Steidle.
Admiral STEIDLE. Yes, sir.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Admiral.
Admiral STEIDLE. Yes, sir. Did you say vehicles, sir, or——
Chairman BOEHLERT. What mission?
Admiral  STEIDLE.—test  mission?  Which  mission?  We  don’t  know
exactly  what  the  mission  will  be  to  demonstrate  Prometheus,  but
we are doing an analysis of alternatives to define exactly that.

39

On  Prometheus  in  general,  we  looked  at  the  risk  and  the  scope
and the dollar value of the JIMO mission that was proposed. After
we  signed  the  MOU  with  Naval  Reactors  through  its  Department
of  Energy  hat,  we  did  an  assessment  of  that  particular  mission,
found  that  we  were  pushing  the  state  of  the  art  for  what  we  were
trying to achieve in the JIMO mission, so we looked at some earlier
spirals,  earlier  demonstrations  of  fuel  capabilities,  probably  in  ’08,
demonstration  of  a  prototype  in  ’11,  and  hopefully,  for  a  mission
by—within  the—another  decade.  We  haven’t  defined  exactly  what
that  mission  will  be,  but  it  will  be  a  demonstration  of  an  in-space
nuclear  electric  capability,  a  joint  exploration  and  science  mission.

CREW EXPLORATION VEHICLE

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much.  The  basis  param-
eters for the Crew Exploration Vehicle, including the crew size and
whether it could service the Space Station.

Mr.  GREGORY.  The  RFP  for  that  will  go  out,  I  believe,  the  first
week  of  March.  We  anticipate  a  response  back,  and  a  selection  in
the  August  timeframe,  and  let  me,  again,  give  Mr.—Admiral
Steidle the opportunity to talk about that area.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Admiral.
Admiral  STEIDLE.  Yes,  sir.  Mr.  Chairman,  what  we  have  done,
slightly different, is we have tried to leave the trade space open as
wide as we possibly could, first thing. And we tried to get as much
participation  with  industry  as  we  could  in  the  early  design  and
scope of the concepts.

Chairman BOEHLERT. That is to be applauded.
Admiral STEIDLE. Yes, sir. So what we—thank you—what we did
is we led a Broad Agency Announcement, and we picked 11 teams.
They  go  from  the  traditional  primes  down  to  t/Space,  and  some  of
the nontraditional players, and brought them into the fold, actually
working  with  us  to  define  the  requirements,  and  helping  us  write
the RFP. So we have kept that trade space open. The final version
of the RFP will go out by the 1st of March, with a selection, as Mr.
Gregory  said,  in  August.  We  are  going  to  keep  that  trade  space
open  through  about  the  summer  of  ’06,  when  we  will  define  with
more  rigor  such  parameters  and  capabilities,  such  as  the  number
of crew, and the launch vehicles, and pieces of that nature.

NASA’S PROPOSED IRAN NONPROLIFERATION ACT REMEDY

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  NASA’s  plan  for  dealing  the  Iran  Non-

proliferation Act.

Mr.  GREGORY.  I  appreciate  that  question.  As  we  all  work  to  ac-
complish the President’s Vision for Space Exploration, we recognize
that this is a journey for all mankind, and as with endeavors such
as the International Space Station, the cooperation of international
partners will be welcome.

I  can  tell  you  from  personal  experience  we  have  worked  very,
very closely with the Russians, and I will tell you, it has really sur-
prised  me  how  close  these  two  countries  have  come,  and  how  they
have  certainly  exceeded  our  expectations.  There  have  certainly
been  challenges.  There  are  always  challenges  in  programs  such  as
this.  But  we  recently  accomplished  something  called  a  balance

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

agreement,  which  preceded  the  INA  activity,  or  the  INA  Act.  And
we are now very comfortable with the ability to maintain and sus-
tain  a  human  presence,  both  American  and  Russian,  on  the  Inter-
national  Space  Station  through  April  2006.  It  includes  transfer,
crew transfer both ways, and Station crew rescue capabilities.

The Administration is interested in seeking a balanced approach
that  continues  to  protect  our  non-proliferation  goals  while  advanc-
ing  potential  U.S.  cooperation  with  Russia  on  the  Vision  for  U.S.
Space  Exploration.  Such  a  balanced  approach  must  include  the
Iran  Nonproliferation  Act  of  2000,  which  is  the  INA,  which  cur-
rently  complicates  the  cooperation  with  Russian  on  the  Inter-
national Space Station, and we also have to address the impact on
cooperation  with  Russia  on  our  future  space  explorations,  efforts
related  to  human  space  flight.  To  that  end,  the  Administration
looks  forward  to  working  with  Congress  to  ensure  that  the  Vision
for  the  U.S.  Space  Exploration  is  able  to  succeed  while  remaining
fully  consistent  with  broader  U.S.  national  security  and  non-pro-
liferation goals.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  So  when  will  we  know?  We  welcome  their
cooperation in space exploration, and applaud that. I would like to
see that same cooperation——

Mr. GREGORY. It is——
Chairman BOEHLERT.—with nonproliferation.
Mr.  GREGORY.  This  is  a  very  critical  decision,  that  has  to  be
made,  and  an  agreement  and  understanding.  I  can’t  tell  you  yet
what  the  form  of  it  will  be,  but  I  do  know  that  NASA,  along  with
the  Administration  and  the  Department  of  State,  are  working  dili-
gently to prepare, so that we can engage with the Congress to come
to  an  understanding.  I  would  say  that  it  would  be  sooner  rather
than  later,  and  if  you  will  allow,  when  we  get  greater  detail,  we
will report back to you, sir.

LAUNCH VEHICLE FOR THE CREW EXPLORATION VEHICLE

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  And  finally,  the  launch  vehicle  for  the

CEV.

Mr. GREGORY. Let me give—again—this to Admiral Steidle.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Admiral.
Admiral  STEIDLE.  Yes,  sir.  What  we  have  done,  sir,  is  taken  a
step  back,  and  I  will  get  to  answer  in  just  a  second.  But  what  we
have done is pulled out all of the trade studies that have been done
from launch vehicles. We worked together, Bill Readdy, myself, and
our Director of Mission Safety and Analysis, Brian O’Connor, to re-
define the human ratings plan and human ratings document.

We  have—are  going  to  share  that  with  the  industry.  We  are
going to complete our trade studies, and present the capabilities to
industry right after we put the RFP out, and that will be in April,
so  that  is  the  capability  that  is  going  to  be  required  for  the  Crew
Exploration Vehicle.

During the summertime, when we select the two teams that will
actually  build  the  demonstration  model  and  go  forward,  we  will
share with them the human ratings document and plan, so that we
can  integrate  this  as  a  total  system.  We  will  also  go  out  with  an
RFP  for  a  launch  vehicle  to  support  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle.

In  the  December  timeframe,  we  should  have  the  selection  of  the
Crew Exploration Vehicle launch vehicle.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you.  I  have  exercised  the  privilege
of  the  chair  by  going  beyond  my  normal  five  minute  question  pe-
riod,  but  these  are  questions  that  are  on  the  minds  of  all  of  us  on
this committee, on both sides of the center aisle. And from the an-
swers,  and  some  of  those,  understandably,  were  somewhat  vague,
you can appreciate why we are having this hearing, and are deter-
mined  to  follow  through  and  work  cooperatively  with  you  to  ferret
out  the  answers,  so  that  we  can  make  some  decisions  based  upon
fact, rather than just theory, or for that matter, emotion.

We  all  are  excited  by  space  exploration,  and  I  was  one  who  was
there  when  the  President  gave  his  January  14  speech  last  year.  I
stood  and  applauded,  because  he  inspired  us  all.  He  outlined  a  vi-
sion, and to his credit, he didn’t say we are going to do it tomorrow,
and Congress, write me a blank check. But he did indicate a deter-
mined effort to explore the great beyond, and that is something we
all are interested in.

Mr. Gordon.
Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That was an important
line  of  questioning.  Over  the  last  few  years,  we  have  been  given  a
lot  of  wait  and  see  type  answers,  and  I  think  it  is  important  that
we  do  set  some  deadlines,  and  I  will  try  to  be  brief,  to  make  up
for  your  lack  of  brevity  here,  because  you  served  us  all  with  those
questions.

SOYUZ AND THE IRAN NONPROLIFERATION ACT

Now, Mr. Gregory, the last Soyuz we have contracted for goes up
this  year.  And  so  in  terms  of  timetables,  next  year,  either  we  are
going to have—the President is going to have to certify compliance,
or there is going to have a repeal of the Non-Proliferation period—
Treaty. Is that correct?

Mr. GREGORY. Sir, would you repeat the question——
Mr. GORDON. Yes.
Mr. GREGORY.—one more time?
Mr.  GORDON.  Since  the  last  Soyuz  is  going  to  be  going  up  this
year,  that  we  have  contracted  for,  they  have  agreed  to  do,  and  we
have no alternative method, then next year, and the Russians have
made  it  clear,  over  and  over,  that  they  are  not  going  to  do  it  at
their  own  expense,  then  so  next  year  we  are  going  to—the  Presi-
dent  either  has  to  certify  compliance  or  there  is  going  to  have  to
be some type of repeal of the Iran Non-Proliferation Treaty. Is that
correct?

Mr.  GREGORY.  Sir,  you  are  correct  that  we  have  an  agreement
with  the  Russians  for  them  to  carry  out  the  crew  transfer  and  the
rescue.  As  I  had  stated  earlier,  it  is  vital  that  an  agreement  be
reached  on  how  we  handle  the  INA.  That  is  still  being  discussed
on  the  Administration’s  side,  and  as  soon  as  we  are  aware  of  the
medium with which we will approach Congress, we will come back.
From  my  point  of  view,  it  is  essential,  it  is  mandatory,  and  it  will
set us up to continue the build and completion of the International
Space Station.

Mr.  GORDON.  Now,  the  Russians  have  made  it  clear,  they  have
said over and over, they are—that they are not going to do this on

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

their own. So if that is the case procedurally, then, if we have to—
and  we  have  no  alternative  but  to  purchase  additional  Soyuzes
next year. Then the only alternative, is this correct, that either the
President  has  to  certify  compliance,  or  there  has  to  be  repeal  or
modification of the Act? Is that correct?

Mr. GREGORY. Something will have to occur, yes.
Mr.  GORDON.  I  know  that.  Right.  But  would  it  have  to  be  one  of
those—is  it—is  there  anything  other  than  one  of  those  two  alter-
natives?

Mr. GREGORY. At this moment, I am aware, perhaps a waiver or
an  exception.  Other  than  that,  sir,  I  am—I  don’t  know  what  the
other vehicles would be.

Mr.  GORDON.  There  is  a  waiver  or  something.  Could  you—then,
could  you  lay  out—would  you  provide  for  the  Committee,  please,
what those alternatives would be?

Mr.  GREGORY.  Sir,  if  we  would  allow—we  will  provide  that  for

the record, as soon as——

Mr. GORDON. Right.
Mr. GREGORY. As soon as we learn.
Mr.  GORDON.  Well,  you  don’t  know?  I  am  not  asking  you  what
the  President  is  going  to  do.  I  am  asking  you  what  are  the  alter-
natives the President can do?

Mr. GREGORY. Well, those——
Mr. GORDON. Those should be known, shouldn’t they?
Mr. GREGORY. Well, those are the two that I can speak of at this
moment.  But  if  you  would  allow,  I  will  research  and  provide  it  for
the record.

NASA WORKFORCE

Mr. GORDON. Again, I am not—I know that you, you know, don’t
have  ESP.  You  can’t  know  what  the  President  is  going  to  do,  but
you—he, I assume he is going to ask you what are the alternatives,
and that is what we would like to know, what the alternatives and
what  the  timeframe  would  go  with  that.  Let  me  ask  you,  also,  ap-
proximately how many employees does NASA currently have? Just
approximately.

Mr. GREGORY. Jim Jennings, can you give us an answer?
Mr.  JENNINGS.  Yes.  We  have  approximately  18,000  employees  in

NASA today.

Mr.  GORDON.  And  what  does  your  five  year  budget  assume  for

the workforce levels over the next five years?

Mr. JENNINGS. Our current budget, we are budgeted through ’07
for the 18,000 employees. Going into ’07, we are budgeted for about
2,000  less  than  that,  and  over  the  next  two  years,  we  are  going  to
work to understand our exploration program, and where that com-
petition  lies,  and  our  assumption  is  we  will  remain  close  to  the
18,000 during the—through the run-up.

Mr.  GORDON.  I  thought  you  said  there  were  going  to  be  2,000

less. And you can’t take 2,000 off, and then still have 18.

Mr.  JENNINGS.  Our  current  budget  planning  is  2,000  less  begin-
ning  in  ’07,  but  we  have  a  lot  of  work  that  hasn’t  been  defined  in
the  exploration  program.  Our  expectation  is,  over  the—during  this
budget process, that work will be defined, and then, we can assign
folks in the center to that fund.

Mr.  GORDON.  But  you  can’t  put—you  can’t  really  have  an  accu-
rate  five  year  budget  without  knowing  what  your  workforce  level
is going to be.

Mr. JENNINGS. The process we go through, we define the mission,
and  then  we  look  at  and  see  what  human  resources  is  required  to
carry out that mission.

Mr.  GORDON.  Well,  that  means  you  are  going  to  be  getting  rid
of  current  employees  that  don’t  meet  your—the  mission,  and  bring
in additional employees that will have the skills and talents.

Mr.  JENNINGS.  That  will  be  part  of  the  process,  looking  at  our
skill  mix  issues,  but  to  answer  the  question,  as  we  put  the  budget
together,  we  didn’t  have  a  lot  of  the  exploration  vision  defined,  so
we couldn’t assign those employees at centers to it. So as we define
those, we will assign the folks at the centers to that particular dol-
lar lines.

BUYOUTS

Mr.  GORDON.  And  you  have  advertised  buyouts  at  a  number  of
the  centers.  Can  you  tell  us  how  many  employees  you  are  hoping
to take the buyouts and how many actually took the buyouts?

Mr.  JENNINGS.  The  current  buyouts  that  we  had  planned,  this
year,  we  had  hoped  to  get  about  425  employees  to  take  those
buyouts. We got about 325. We are offering the buyout again across
the Agency, and we hope to get about the same number in this new
buyout.

Mr. GORDON. Let me compliment you for—its—we don’t often get
specific information here, and I thank you for helping us with that.
Mr.  Gregory,  the  NASA  briefing  charts  indicate  that  NASA  has
a team looking at, and I quote ‘‘transformation to alternative orga-
nizations,  such  as  Federally-Funded  Research  and  Development
Centers,  and  further  consolidations  with  additional  facility  clo-
sures.’’  In  other  words,  privatizing  the  NASA  centers  or  shutting
down some of the facilities. Could you give the Committee specifics
on what is being planned?

Mr.  GREGORY.  Certainly,  sir.  Well,  first  of  all,  as  you  look  at
the—if  you  look  at  the  exploration  vision,  the  exploration  vision  is
probably  the  largest  sustained  activity  that  I  am  aware  of,  cer-
tainly  nothing  like  this  has  ever  occurred  in  the  government,  and
probably in industry. As you transform and prepare yourself to look
forward,  and  to  sustain  an  activity  like  this,  it  requires  changes.
It  is  absolutely  mandatory  that  changes  occur.  As  we  have  reorga-
nized  the  headquarters  to  bring  together  the  themes  that  we  have
in  order  to  support,  it  also  requires  that  we  look  at  the  skill  mix
that  we  have  in  the  agency.  It  looks  at  how  we  get  the  best  bang
for the buck. We are all taxpayers. We want that—the monies that
come to us to be spent in a very reasoned way.

It  also  requires  that  not  only  do  we  look  at  the  skill  mix,  but  it
also requires that we take a look at the facilities that we have, and
there  are  activities  where  we  look  not  at  closing  down  centers  at
all.  That  is  not  part  of  it.  But  looking  at  those  resources  that  we
have, assets that we have, to determine what is necessary, both in
the  short  term  and  the  long-term,  that  we  should  either  maintain,
upgrade,  shut  down,  and  rebuild.  Another  thing  we  are  looking  at
are  management  organizations.  You  mentioned  the  FFRDC,  the

44

Federally-Funded  Research  and  Development,  but  that  is  one  of
many alternatives that we are looking at, a university affiliate, in-
dustry  partnerships,  government  institutes  of  sorts.  And  so  we
have  actually  asked  each  center  director  to  evaluate  what  they  do,
and determine what are those obstacles, or those hindrances, to do
even greater work.

And so each center is looking at them, and there was a team put
together that came up with several options, but I think it was very
clear, as the team worked together, that there was not a single so-
lution, that it could be one of several, that it would not necessarily
replace,  but  might  complement.  And  so  all  of  those  activities  are
going on as the Agency transforms itself to support the exploration
vision.

Mr.  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Gregory.  My  time  is  running  out.
But  let  me  just  say  it  was  almost  staggering,  in  terms  of  mag-
nitude, that you described the changes that are getting ready to go
on. This is sort of the genie going out of the box here. That is why
we really would like to be partners with you in trying to determine
where  NASA  is  going,  because  there  is  the  potential  to  lose  a  tre-
mendous  amount  of  skill  and  employees,  and  institutional  knowl-
edge  that  can’t  be  replicated.  And  so  we  have  got  to  be  sure  that
we  are  going  the  right  direction,  and  a  sustainable  direction,  be-
cause the magnitude that you pointed out, there is no turning back.
Mr.  GREGORY.  Yes,  sir.  And  I  certainly  agree  with  you,  and  that
is  why,  as  Mr.  Jennings  just  mentioned,  we  have  several  years  to
thoroughly  assess  and  make  a  reasoned—or  give  you  a  reasoned
answer.  No  rash  decisions  at  all,  as  far  as  I  can  tell,  and  I  think
that you will be very satisfied and pleased with the way the Agency
responds to these very important questions.

Mr.  GORDON.  It  sounded  like  two  or  three  years  was—I  don’t
know whether that is several, but it was—there is going to be some
pretty big things happening in two or three years.

Mr. GREGORY. Until 2007, we have stability.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you.  The  gentleman’s  time  has  ex-
pired, and I want to commend the gentleman from Tennessee, who
has  proven  that  Democrats  are  as  loquacious  as  Republicans,  and
just as constructive and productive in the line of questioning.

Mr. Calvert.

SPACE SHUTTLE FLIGHT MANIFEST

Mr.  CALVERT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Greg-

ory, for your testimony.

I  guess  this  question  is  for  both  you  and  Mr.—and  Admiral
Steidle.  You  mentioned  that  approximately  28  missions  were  nec-
essary  to  finish  the  International  Space  Station,  and  as  we  all
know,  when  we  look  at  the  budget  for  NASA,  the  first  thing  that
strikes you, of course, is that the Shuttle and the Station itself take
up  approximately  40  percent  of  the  overall  budget.  So  in  order  for
us to move on to the President’s vision, we need to stay on budget
and finish the Station as soon as possible.

Of  the  flights  that  are  going  to  Station,  how  many  are  solely  for
the assembly of the International Space Station, and how many are
purely supply missions?

Mr.  GREGORY.  As  is  usually  the  case,  all  Navy  guys  look  the
same.  It  was  actually  Bill  Readdy,  also  a  Navy  person,  who  would
be the appropriate person to answer that question.

Mr. CALVERT. All right.
Mr.  READDY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Calvert.  The  28  flight  manifest  is
a mix of some modules going up and logistics, and so you can’t nec-
essarily take one mission and say, okay, that is a logistics mission
solely, because each and every mission is going to carry some logis-
tics.  Not  every  mission  is  dedicated  to  a  particular  cargo  element.
So  there  is  some  logistics  and  some  assembly  in  most  of  those
flights.

I will get you the answer for the record, because we are assessing
the  mission  content  from  that  28  flights  and  working  backwards,
based on our exploration vision.

ALTERNATIVES FOR INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION

CONSTRUCTION

Mr.  CALVERT.  The  reason  I  was  asking  that  question,  are  there
alternatives—and  some  testimony  that  indicated  that  there  was—
besides  the  Shuttle.  Obviously,  the  Shuttle  is  an  expensive  infra-
structure  to  maintain,  but  the  sooner  we  get  the  Station  done,  the
sooner  we  could  retire  the  Shuttle.  Is  there—have  you  looked  into
other lifting components to—that would be able to lift these compo-
nents and get this done sooner?

Mr.  GREGORY.  Yes,  sir,  we  have.  And  just  to  set  the  stage  here,
the  International  Space  Station  right  now,  that  is  on  orbit  right
now,  circling  the  world  every  hour  and  a  half,  is  about  half-built.
It  is  about  the  size  of  a  747  jumbo  jet.  The  solar  arrays  have  got
about  the  same  wingspan  as  a  747,  about  the  same  habitable  vol-
ume. Most of the other components are at the Kennedy Space Cen-
ter,  and  they  have  already  been  integrated  into  launch  packages,
and they are ready to go, with the exception of the Columbus Lab-
oratory that the Europeans are providing, which is over in Bremen,
Germany, and some other components. So——

Mr. CALVERT. Have you looked into if, in fact, basically, the com-
ponents  that  are  on  the  shop  floor,  and  it  is  a  matter  of  getting
these  components  up  and  constructing  the  Station  to  its—to  com-
pletion,  if  in  fact,  we  resolve  our  issues  with  Russia  and  the  Iran
proliferation problem that we have to work out, could they be help-
ful  in  getting  this  done  sooner  by  using  some  of  their  lift  capa-
bility?

Mr. GREGORY. We have already looked at the ability to use other
launch vehicles, and because those launch packages, those modules
were  designed  to  be  launched  on  board  the  Space  Shuttle,  the
launch  environments,  the  loads,  the  integration  of  those  different
packages  doesn’t  allow  you  to  repackage  those  for  a  different
launch  vehicle,  with  different  interfaces,  without  substantial  rede-
sign. So we don’t think that that is possible. It may be that by ad-
justing  the  manifest,  there  are  some  components  of  the  Inter-
national  Space  Station  that,  based  on  our  new  exploration  vision,
and  that  of  our  partners,  may  no  longer  fit  in  the  assembly  se-
quence, though.

CREW EXPLORATION VEHICLE DEVELOPMENT

Mr. CALVERT. Going back to the CEV for a second, Admiral, you
mentioned  in  your  testimony  in  answering  a  question  that  deter-
mining  at  this  point  exactly  how  that  vehicle  is  going  to  be  com-
prised  and  moved  forward,  it  seems  me,  I  am  new  to  this  Chair-
manship. I have been here two weeks, but I have been on the Com-
mittee 12 years, that we haven’t had a lot of great success in work-
ing  out  the—a  new  launch  vehicle.  Can  you  make  us  more  com-
fortable  up  here,  what  new  emerging  technology  we  have,  and
whether  or  not  you  are  looking  at  new  emerging  technology,  and
new commercial folks out there, that can provide us some hope that
we can actually get this completed?

Admiral STEIDLE. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. We have, as I alluded to, we
have  done  a  lot  of  trade  studies  analysis.  This  is  for  the  Crew  Ex-
ploration  Vehicle,  not  the  Heavy  Lift,  which—we  can  segregate
those  two  pieces  into  different  avenues.  But  on  the  Crew  Explo-
ration  Vehicle,  there  is  a  lot  of  commercial  pieces  that  are  avail-
able.  The—we  are  looking  from  the  Shuttle-derived  variations,
where we can take the reliability of pieces that have been used on
the  Shuttle,  to  what  is  being  used  on  the  EELVs  today,  and  doing
the trade studies on both of those pieces.

And  that  is  the  process  that  we  are  going  through.  You  have  to
look at the life cycle costs of those particular systems, the logistics
efforts of those, the infrastructure that is in place today, versus the
development  costs  that  are  needed  later  on,  and  then,  the  human
rating aspects of that, what it costs to actually put the Crew Explo-
ration  Vehicle  on  top  of  these  particular  pieces.  That  will  be  con-
cluded  in  April,  and  then,  Bill  and  I  will  work  as—together  to  go
forward  to  define  those  capabilities  that  are  going  to  be  required
by the summertime for the teams that will actually build the dem-
onstration,  they  need  to  have  that  information  by  the  summer  of
’06.

There  is  assets—there  are  assets  out  there  that  will  meet  our
needs. There are proposals from these 11 teams that we have been
working  with  for  the  last  year  right  now,  to  put  the  Crew  Explo-
ration  Vehicle  on  top  of  it.  So  I  feel  very  confident  that  we  are
going to move forward, and have a very good solution for it.

Mr. CALVERT. Thank you, Admiral. I see my time has expired.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  The  gentleman’s  time  has  expired.  Ms.

Jackson Lee.

Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  to
the  full  Committee  Chairman  and  Ranking  Member,  to  the  Sub-
committee Chairman and Ranking Member. I think this committee
and  the  responsibility  of  oversight  is,  if  you  will,  embracing  of  all
philosophies.  We  know  the  importance  of  NASA.  We  know  the  im-
portance of science, and so we come to the hearing with the concept
of how we can do better.

And  I  thought  I  would  just  offer  some  observations  that  are
somewhat  painful,  but  I  think  it  is  important  to  couch  our  debate
or  our  discussion  in  a  very  realistic  perspective.  First  of  all,  the
budget that we are operating under, the proposed Administration’s
budget,  and  the  constraints  that  we  have  to  work  on  here  in  Con-
gress, I think, can be appropriately named the pinch and pain fed-

eral  budget.  It  makes  it  very  difficult  for  us  to  make  the  right
kinds  of  choices,  and  it  forces  on  us  priorities  that  eliminate  some
very good options and opportunities.

I am concerned about that.
I also believe that NASA has gained, and I thank Ranking Mem-
ber Gordon for his leadership in terms of the advocacy that he has
shown  as  it  relates  to  the  NASA  human  Space  Shuttle  in  par-
ticular,  because  I  am  reminded  of  more  than  10  years  ago,  when
it  was  a  very,  very  tall  mountain  to  climb  in  order  to  get  across
the board support from all regions of the country to support NASA.
Frankly,  I  believe  it  is  important  for  us  to  develop  stakeholders,
more  so  than  the  reordering  of  an  appropriations  process  to  make
friends. You don’t make friends that way. You make friends by en-
suring that the NASA program invests in many aspects of science,
including human Space Shuttle, which I happen to be a very strong
supporter of.

FUTURE OF NASA WORKFORCE

As  I  look  at,  if  I  may  pose  these  questions  dealing  with  employ-
ees and staffing, and I do so even in light of the fact that Kennedy
and Johnson, Johnson in Texas, may have some protection only be-
cause  we  are  dealing  with  the  human  Space  Shuttle  for  the  next
couple  of  years,  up  to  2010.  But  I  always  am  reminded  of  the  fact
that  if  they  come  for  you  at  night,  they  will  come  for  me  in  the
morning.  And  so  it  is  important  to  understand  what  we  are  doing
with our employees.

I  am  particularly  concerned  that  if  we  have  these  rumors  about
closing, one, you are losing outstanding research scientists. Two, all
of  your  future  scientists  now  being  trained  in  our  institutions
around  the  Nation,  our  institutions  of  higher  learning  around  the
Nation,  and  possibly  international  scientists,  have  no  reason  to
look  toward  NASA  or  look  toward  the  science  entities  here  in  the
United  States,  because  we  are  cutting  individuals.  Of  course,
maybe  your  answer  will  be  that  you  are  cutting  administrative,  et
cetera.  But  that  is  not  what  is  going  out  across  the  wires.  So  I
want  that  question  again,  and  I  know  that  it  was  probed  earlier,
but  this  seems  like  a  BRAC.  We  have  no  understanding,  we—is
there a commission? What is your timetable, etc.?

My second question leads into my safety concern. The CEV vehi-
cle that we are talking about, and I do want to acknowledge, mind
my  manners,  thank  Sean  O’Keefe,  the  Administrator,  for  his  great
service,  and  I  do  want  to  say  Administrator  Gregory,  which  I  will
call you, your service is to be appreciated by this nation and by this
committee.  We  thank  you  very  much.  But  this  vehicle  that  is  pro-
posed, there are proposals, but it is a draft request for proposal. It
contains no requirement for the CEV to ferry crews to and from the
International  Space  Station.  One  of  the  concerns  I  had  with  the
Gehman report, and I couch it in terms of concerns, is that it didn’t
go far enough to review the safety needs of the International Space
Station.

Over  the  months  and  years,  we  have  heard  of  different  defi-
ciencies. Safety is a big issue. Safety is an issue for the astronauts.
Safety is an issue for those who are at Kennedy and Johnson. Safe-
ty is an issue for the ISS, and I would like specifically to ask what

48

questions.

is  the  safety  budget?  Where  is  that  line  item  for  the  next  five
years,  and  what  is  it  for  the  last  two  years,  so  that  we  can  com-
pare? What is NASA’s commitment to safety? So I ask you to share
with  me  your  ordering  of  this  BRAC  for  NASA.  How  are  we  going
to protect these employees or reinvest in our employees, so that we
get  the  kind  of  talent  we  need,  the  CEV  question,  and  of  course,
the safety question.

I thank you, Mr. Gregory, very much.
Mr.  GREGORY.  Thank  you,  ma’am.  Very,  very,  very  important

Let  me  address  the  awareness,  and  I  think  you  have  rightfully
pointed  out  an  issue  that  we  have  really  been  working  with.  I
think,  if  you  would  really  look  at  what  has  occurred  in  the  last
year,  we  have  always  believed  that  if  we  make  decisions  at  Head-
quarters,  everybody  knows  exactly  what  it  means,  and  there  is  no
misinterpretation.  What  we  found  out  was,  in  fact,  that  doesn’t
happen.  And  many  times,  decisions  are  made,  and  they  are  mis-
interpreted,  and  what  we  end  up  with  are  a  series  of  rumors  and
people are very concerned about it, not only from their welfare, but
the  integrity  of  the  programs  that  they  are  working  on.  We  have
taken  a  very  active  role  in  the  last  year  to  move  to  each  center,
and in fact, we have done that, with a group of folks, where we talk
about those very specific areas and issues.

And  we  have  also  been—major—we  have  also  encouraged  the
center  directors  to  go  back  and  tell,  as  they  should,  exactly  what
the  plans  are.  Sometimes,  we  miss  a  person,  or  a  group  of  people,
and we then very quickly try to go back and describe exactly what
the  process  is,  how  it  works  with  the  vision,  and  what  the  trans-
formations  that  occur,  and  after  we  have  been  able  to  do  that,  we
have  had,  I  think,  very  good  agreement  and  understanding  by  our
people. But we really need to do more.

NASA BUDGET AND SAFETY

The  second  issue,  on  safety.  You  have  at  this  table  two  people
who  actually  flew  in  the  Space  Shuttle,  myself  and  Bill  Readdy.
And  so  we  are  very  aware  of  the  issues  that  you  are  mentioning.
There has been a major re-look at the safety program in the agen-
cy.  It  has  also  looked  at  the  independent  assessments.  It  has  also
looked  at  the  way  that  the  agency  can  determine  whether  choices
or  decisions  or  waivers  that  have  been  granted  are,  in  fact,  valid.
And  so  this  is  a  dialogue  that  we  should  we  have  where  we  fully
explain all of the pieces and parts that not only responds to the Ac-
cident Investigation Board, but we believe go way beyond that.

Your  question  of  budget,  we  have  Steve  Isakowitz,  the  Comp-

troller, on the end, and Steve, can you handle that?

Mr. ISAKOWITZ. Yes, sir. You asked a question on budget with re-

gard to the safety.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Sir.
Mr.  ISAKOWITZ.  Yeah.  We  actually  don’t  have  specific  budgets
just  for  safety.  We  have,  in  a  number  of  areas,  teams  of  folks  that
are  dedicated,  such  as  the  NASA  Engineering  and  Safety  Center,
that we had set up in this year’s budget, which is about $70 million
in the ’06 request. We also had set up an independent technical au-
thority,  which  was  one  of  the  recommendations  that  came  out  of

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

49

the CAIB, and there, we had identified about $80 million in the ’06
budget for that purpose. But we also, in the dollars that we invest
in the Shuttle and Station program, we have people as part of their
job,  safety  is  an  important  aspect  for  it.  And  so  to  that  degree,  we
don’t specifically break out those safety-related items, even though
it is integral to the overall safety strategy.

Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  see  my  time  is
up.  May  I  just  pose  this  question  to  the  Chairman?  I  would  really
like  them  to  provide  me  in  writing  those  specific  numbers  on  safe-
ty,  and  also,  the  answer  regarding  the  number  of  employees  they
are projecting to be cutting from around those centers. And I would
appreciate  it  very  much.  And  I  thank  the  Chairman  for  his  indul-
gence.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  and  all  Members
will be given the opportunity to submit questions in writing to our
witnesses, and we will accumulate them, submit them to Mr. Greg-
ory and his team, and ask for timely responses.
The Chair now recognizes Mr. Hall of Texas.

SPACE SHUTTLE AND CREW EXPLORATION VEHICLE SAFETY

MODIFICATIONS

Mr.  HALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  think  Ms.  Jackson  Lee
hit  on  the  thing  that  this  country  listens  more  for  at  this  time  in
conjunction  with  the  space  program  than  anything  else,  and  that
is  safety.  And  I  would  like  more  specific  than  we  have  been  given.
I know it is difficult to design, because of weight problems, prop-
er  material,  and  designs,  but  two  things  that  have  kept  us  from
having a safety escape mechanism of some type for these men and
women,  isn’t  design  and  difficulty,  but  design  and  cost.  I  can’t  ac-
cept  the  fact  that  you  can  put  cost  into  that,  because  I  don’t  think
you can put a figure on the lives of the people that have—we have
already lost, and all of you know that two years ago, the Columbia
disaster underscored, I think, the sad reality that we have not done
enough to ensure crew safety.

I  think  you  remember,  or  are  aware  of  the  fact,  and  I  am  sure
the  Comptroller  is,  that  I  authorized  an  amendment  that  was  in-
cluded  in  last  year’s  NASA  funding  bill,  that  calls  for  $15  million
to  be  used  to  solicit  the  best  concepts  from  the  aerospace  industry
and  elsewhere  to  improve  Shuttle  crew  survivability.  You  are
aware of that, are you not?

And  I  will  go  ahead  and  ask  the  second  question.  What  safety
changes  have  you  made  for  the  first  future  flight,  which  I  under-
stand the window opens about May the 12th for this year?

Mr. GREGORY. Mr. Hall, why don’t I let Mr. Readdy answer that
question,  but  let  me  tell  you  something.  Safety  permeates  NASA.
We  have  values,  NASA  values,  number  one  is  safety.  Number  two
is the NASA family. Number three is excellence. Number four is in-
tegrity. When you go to different centers, you talk to different peo-
ple,  they  don’t  have  a  variation  of  that.  That  is—those  are  the
NASA values that we have, that we work to every day. Bill Readdy
has  been  on  top  of  the—of  all  of  the  safety  enhancements,  and  I
think—Bill,  can  you,  why  don’t  you  summarize  some  of  those  for
Mr. Hall?

Mr.  READDY.  Mr.  Hall,  thank  you  for  your  support.  Crew  escape
is, I think, what you are talking about, and as you mentioned, the
inherent design of the Space Shuttle really makes it nigh on impos-
sible to put that into the Space Shuttle design. That was one of the
things that influenced our thinking on making sure that we would
only  fly  those  flights  necessary  through  the  end  of  the  decade  to
complete  the  International  Space  Station.  And  not  fly  to  2020,  as
had been previously planned.

Admiral Steidle and his folks are ensuring that in the request for
proposals  for  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle,  that  we  build  in  crew
escape  throughout  all  modes  of  that  vehicle.  And  I  think  that  rep-
resents  the  real  commitment  that  we  have  in  the  future  to  pro-
viding a safer means of getting crew to and from space.

Very  specifically,  though,  in  the  Space  Shuttle  world,  as  we  all
know,  the  foam  liberated  off  the  tank  caused  the  accident.  But  we
haven’t  simply  looked  at  insulation  of  that  external  tank  as  what
we  must  do  to  Return-to-Flight.  Today,  we  are  testing  solid  rocket
motors  out  in  Utah.  Today,  the  Stafford-Covey  task  group  is  down
in  Florida  reviewing  our  progress  on  Return-to-Flight  implementa-
tion plan. We are looking across the Space Shuttle hardware, from
stem  to  stern,  including  all  the  ground  operations  that  we  do,  and
the  management  operations,  in  order  to  make  sure  that  we  come
back  not  only  much  smarter  as  a  result  of  the  Columbia  accident
investigation, but also with a much stronger and safer program.

Mr. HALL. I certainly don’t question anybody’s interest in safety,
nor would I even dare to question those of you who have undergone
the  vicissitudes  of  flight,  and  the  dangers,  and  know  better  than
any  of  us  here  the—really  the  fragility  of  that  flight  in  the  future,
and that one that we are going to launch later this year, and those
that follow.

What I want to know is, and I understand the difficulty involved
in attaching or installing an escape module in any of the three ex-
isting  Shuttles,  but  I  don’t  really  want  to  see  us  initiate  any  new
thrusts  unless  we  are  at  least  underway  with  incorporating  safety
mechanisms  and  devices.  I  won’t  say  modules,  because  you  may
have a module, and you can’t put a module in a module, but I use
the words safety mechanisms and devices. I think that is what this
country  and  this  committee  and  this  Congress,  and  this—and  ev-
eryone interested in the space thrust is listening for, is safety that
you are underway with now. I would hate to have another tragedy,
and  not  have  us  underway  with  trying  to  solve  the  problems  that
exist with the losses that we have had.

So  I  guess  what  I  really  would  like  to  know  is  the  $15  million,
how that has been spent, and has it been spent, and is it allocated
still toward that that it was set up for?

Mr. GREGORY. Admiral.
Admiral STEIDLE. Sir, we will have to get you the specifics on ex-
actly  where  the  $15  million  went.  I  can  tell  you,  as  Bill  said,  our
top priority in the Crew Exploration Vehicle is safe escape through-
out  the  entire  envelope,  and  that 
is  through  mechanisms,
modularization, and designed by industry with us. But as——

Mr. HALL. What does that mean?
Admiral  STEIDLE.  That  means  working  with  industry,  we  have
established the capabilities, and we have stated that you—industry

51

and  the  design  team  has  to  have  the  capabilities  for  a  safe  crew
ejection  and  safe  return  throughout  the  entire  envelope.  You  may
miss—we  may  lose  a  mission,  but  we  will  not  lose  the  crew.  That
is  the  design  specifications.  Now,  how  you  do  that  has  to  be  done
together  with  us  and  industry  together  in  that.  Specifically,  where
that  particular  funding  went,  I  will  have  to  get  back  to  you,  be-
cause I don’t have that with me, sir.

SPACE SHUTTLE RETURN-TO-FLIGHT SAFETY

MODIFICATIONS

Mr.  HALL.  All  right.  All  right.  And  the  last  thing  I  want  to  ask,
I  think  there  was  a  question  asked  about  the  basic  changes  in
the—for  the  first  launch.  Was  that  your  question,  Mr.  Chairman?
And  the  number  of  crew  members,  and  I  didn’t  hear  an  answer  to
the number of crew members.

Mr. READDY. With respect to Return-to-Flight.
Mr. HALL. Yes.
Mr.  READDY.  We  have  looked  at  those  things  that  we  must  ac-
complish on that mission, and as you know, the first two flights are
going  to  be  test  flights.  There  are  so  many  things  that  we  have
done to improve the system, that even given the exotic laboratories
that  we  have  here  on  Earth,  the  vacuum  chambers,  the  wind  tun-
nels,  the  computational  fluid  dynamics,  and  everything  else,  quite
simply,  we  won’t  know  until  we  actually  go  fly.  So  the  first  two
missions  are  test  missions.  They  include  a  whole  number  of  safety
changes,  not  only  the  ability  to  observe  the  Space  Shuttle  during
its  ascent,  all  the  way  through  the  external  tank  separation,  the
ability  to  inspect  the  vehicle  with  an  orbiter  boom  sensing  system,
and  then,  when  we  get  to  the  Space  Station,  we  will  also  be  doing
developmental  test  objectives  to  look  at  reinforced  carbon  carbon,
or the wing leading edge material repair, as well as tile repair. All
of  those  things  require  seven  people  on  Return-to-Flight  missions,
sir.

Mr. HALL. So seven is the figure.
Mr.  READDY.  Seven  is  the  figure  for  the  Space  Shuttle  Return-

to-Flight.

Mr. HALL. I thank you. I yield back my time.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much. And that return-to-

flight will be commanded by Colonel Collins?

Mr. READDY. Yes, sir. That is correct. Colonel Eileen Collins, sir.
Chairman BOEHLERT. A New Yorker, I might add. The Chair rec-

ognizes Mr. Udall.

POSSIBILITIES FOR A SHUTTLE SERVICING MISSION TO

HUBBLE

Mr.  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  will  attempt  to  follow
in the footsteps of my good friend, Mr. Hall, in his loquacious brev-
ity.  The  Hubble  Telescope,  of  course,  has  been  the  center  of  a  lot
of  discussion  recently.  I  want  to  focus  my  initial  comments  on  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

52

telescope.  And  I  have  made  no  bones  about  my  support  for  a  serv-
icing mission, and I am afraid the treatment of Hubble in your tes-
timony  doesn’t  really  address  my  objections  to  the  Administration
decision to terminate funding for any Hubble servicing mission.

I  know  you  have  to  support  the  Administration’s  position  on
Hubble, so I don’t expect you to change your testimony, but I would
like to review the bidding. NASA asked the National Academies to
review the options for extending the useful life of Hubble. A distin-
guished  Committee  did  that,  and  their  conclusion  was  unanimous
and  unambiguous,  and  that  was  that  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission
is  the  best  option  for  extending  the  life  of  Hubble,  and  for  pre-
paring  it  for  eventual  robotic  de-orbit.  They  also  concluded  that  a
robotic servicing mission was unlikely to succeed in the time avail-
able.  In  the  wake  of  that  report,  what  did  NASA  do?  Well,  NASA
eliminated  the  funding  for  the  robotic  servicing  mission,  but  it
didn’t  reinstate  the  SM–4  servicing  mission,  and  I  think  I  am  not
alone when I say I don’t understand that.

The Academies Committee squarely addressed the issue of safety
risk,  and  concluded  it  was  comparable  to  flying  the  Shuttle  to  the
Station, which NASA is already committed to doing. And I haven’t
heard any convincing rebuttal from NASA to the Academies safety
risk assessment since their report was issued late last year.

So  in  that  context,  let  us  look  at  the  remaining  issue  of  cost.
Your  accomplished  panel,  Mr.  Gregory,  told  the  Chairman  that  it
would be about 28 flights give or take what will be needed to com-
plete  the  International  Space  Station,  but  you  also  said  this  num-
ber isn’t solid, and could likely change, so it appears to me that the
potential  impact  of  an  extra  Shuttle  flight  to  service  Hubble  is
overwhelmed  by  the  uncertainty  in  the  estimates  of  how  many
more times we will be flying the Shuttle before it is retired.

Isn’t that so?
Mr. GREGORY. Administrator O’Keefe made a very conscious and
deliberate  and  well-informed  decision  that  the  Shuttle  would  not
service  the  Hubble.  We  acknowledge  and  recognize  and  agree  with
the Academy, when it says that the Hubble is a wonderful vehicle,
has  provided  excellent  information.  We  have  learned  quite  a  lot
from it.

Mr. UDALL. Mr. Gregory——
Mr.  GREGORY.  But  I  can  tell  you  that  I  agree  with  Mr.  O’Keefe,
as  a  former  Shuttle  pilot,  and  so  I  have  the—at  least  the  creden-
tials  to  talk  to  you  about  what  it  is  that  I  would  consider  safe  or
risky, and I will make that very strong recommendation to the next
Administrator, who—either he or she is.

Mr. UDALL. No, I am not questioning your service and your valor.
What  I  wanted  to  make  the  point  is,  is  that  in  the  context  of  28
or  30  additional  flights,  because  I  am  talking  about  cost  now,  not
the  safety  side,  of  the  equation  is  that  an  additional  flight  fit  into
that timeframe to me, doesn’t seem to be something that is—would
overwhelm what we are trying to do with the Space Station.

So  if  I  can  continue,  just—my  commentary.  The  National  Acad-
emies,  when  Dr.  Lanzerotti  spoke  before  us  two  weeks  ago,  he
made a very important point. He said that when deciding whether
to  allocate  the  costs  of  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission  to  the  agency’s
science  program,  it  is  important  to  remember  that  throughout  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00056 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

53

life of the Hubble program, the costs of Shuttle missions to service
Hubble  have  never  been  charged  to  the  science  program,  and  the
costs of Shuttle missions to the ISS have never been charged to the
Station program. I believe those statements are both true.

Mr. GREGORY. Now, those were true, and they were certainly ap-

plicable before the Columbia accident.

Mr.  UDALL.  And  so  in  that  context,  do  you  see  any  logical  basis
for  changing  the  commitment  that  Administrator  O’Keefe  made  to
Congress, namely, that the Shuttle costs of SM–4, Shuttle servicing
mission,  would  not  be  charged  to  the  science  program?  This  state-
ment  from—answer  to  a  question  from  Administrator  O’Keefe  was
in  response  to  Mr.  Gordon  asking  him  about  the  Hubble  servicing
mission,  and  it  was  in  this  statement,  which  I  would  like  to  enter
into the record, Mr. Chairman.

Chairman BOEHLERT. No objection.
[The statement follows:]

STATEMENT OF MR. SEAN O’KEEFE

Below is the answer submitted by Mr. Sean O’Keefe, Administrator, National Aer-
onautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA)  in  response  to  written  questions  sub-
mitted  by  Congressman  Bart  Gordon  resulting  from  the  February  27,  2002  Science
Committee hearing on NASA’s FY03 budget request:
Q2. According  to  the  FY  2003  NASA  budget  request,  the  new  policy  is  that  the  cost
of  any  Shuttle  flight  above  the  four  per  year  allocated  to  the  Space  Station  will
be  borne  by  the  customer  for  that  flight.  In  your  response  to  my  question  at  the
February  27th  hearing,  you  stated  that  ‘‘in  the  next  Hubble  servicing  mission
two  years  out,  you  will  see  that  cost  incorporated  in  the  space  science  costs.’’
Does  the  five-year  budget  runout  for  space  science  contained  in  the  FY  2003
budget request include funds for the cost of the Shuttle flight for the next Hubble
servicing mission? If so, how much funding is allocated for that Shuttle mission,
and where is it included in the space science budget, by account and fiscal year?
A2. The  next  Hubble  servicing  mission  is  SM–4,  which  is  scheduled  to  launch  in
2004.  This  long-planned  servicing  mission  is  considered  ‘‘grandfathered  in’’  under
this  policy,  and  the  projected  budget  for  the  mission  was  included  in  the  five-year
budget  run-out  under  the  Office  of  Space  Flight.  The  Office  of  Space  Science  will
have  to  budget  for  the  Hubble  retrieval  mission,  currently  scheduled  for  the  2010
timeframe.

Mr.  UDALL.  The  servicing  mission  was  considered  grandfathered
in  under  this  policy.  So  the  point  I  am  trying  to  make  is  that  I
don’t  think  cost  is  the  concern  here,  and  I  would  like  your  com-
ments.

Mr.  GREGORY.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Udall.  Exactly  right.
Cost is not an issue, as we evaluated whether—if there were extra
flights  or  so  one  of  them  could  go  to  the  Hubble.  That  was  not  an
issue  at  all.  What  we  have  done  is  to  look  at  what  we  have  done
in  the  past,  and  then,  the—I  think  the  Accident  Investigation
Board  was  really  an  eye-opener,  and  there  is  a  paragraph  in  the
Accident  Investigation  Board  report  that  I  would  like  to  enter  into
the  record,  that  really  says  you  know,  you  guys  have  just  become
so can do that sometimes, you forget that this is an extremely risky
business, and we tend to minimize what is sane to do and what is
inappropriate.

As I looked at it from the commander’s point of view, and I have
had that privilege several times, I began to look at what are those
things  that  we  would  have  to  do  to  assure  the  absolute  safety  of
the crew, and then I began to look at the options that we had. One

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00057 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

54

of  those  that  they  mentioned  in  the  Accident  Investigation  Board
was a safe haven.

A  safe  haven  is  a  place  where  you  can  go  without  an  issue  of
whether  you  will  sustain  your  life  or  not,  and  have  the  ability  to
sit and think, not only on-board, but also, the people on the ground.
If you go to the Space Station, you have that opportunity. You have
a  very  large,  as  Mr.  Readdy  talked  about,  a  volume  in  there,  and
you can put all of the crew in there to sit and think.

When  you  go  to  the  Hubble,  you  don’t  have  that  opportunity  at
all. The only life support activities, or the capabilities you have are
those  things  that  are  resident  on  the  Shuttle.  And  I  know  the
Academy  talked  about  30  days.  Well,  let  me  tell  you,  that  is  not
a  good  date.  That  is  something  that  says  you  have  powered  down
the  orbiter  to  a  point  where  you  are  maintaining  the  ability  to
power  up  and  come  home.  But  it  really  doesn’t  address  the  issue
of  what  the  quality  of  life  is  on  board,  or  whether,  in  fact,  it  can
sustain life. We do not have a Transatlantic abort site for a 28 de-
gree  launch.  Now,  let  me  tell  you  what  that  means.  When  you
launch, you always want to have an opportunity to land, and if you
lose  a  system  or  an  engine,  you  would  like  to  be  able  to  proceed
straight  ahead  and  land  at  a  prepared  site.  We  do  not  have  any
sites for 28 degrees, which is a due east launch out of Kennedy.

The next thing is, we would have to hold a vehicle on the ground,
and  that  sounds  simple,  but  to  have  a  vehicle  standing  by  to  get
to  the  orbiter,  that  is—has  a  problem,  within  15  days  or  less.  The
agency  has  never  demonstrated  that  capability  before.  So  this  is  a
very  high  risk  activity.  And  let  us  assume  that  we  had  it.  We  will
have  never,  ever  practiced  a  rendezvous  of  two  orbiters  on  orbit,
and  this  sounds  simple,  again,  but  I  can  tell  you,  and  Bill  Readdy
can  tell  you,  this  is  something  no  one  has  ever  done  before.  Prob-
ably, we could do it. Probably, I don’t know how that means. I don’t
know what that really means. But it also means that we are going
to  have  to  rendezvous  and  get  into  an  attitude,  and  connect  these
two  orbiters.  We  have  never  done  that  before.  And  so  we  have  a
significant  number  of  risks  that  I  think  that  the  Academy  may
have  brushed  over.  And  of  course,  the  first  one  is  that  we  haven’t
launched  it  yet,  and  that  is  not  occurring  until  May,  and  so  there
were  some  assumptions—and  there  are  many,  many  other  areas
that we have looked at——

INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION SAFE HAVEN CAPABILITY

Mr.  UDALL.  I  see  my  time  has  expired.  But  I  think  if  the  Chair-
man will indulge me for a minute. I think this is an important line
of  discussion.  I  understand  what  you  are  saying,  Mr.  Gregory,  but
I  also  know  that—at  least,  I  am  under  the  impression  that  NASA
is not planning for a safe haven on the Space Station after the first
two Shuttle return-to-flight flights. And the question then becomes
how  long  are  you  going  to  baseline  safe  havens,  if  it  is  not  going
to be continued, then essentially, there is no difference between the
ISS and the Hubble Telescope missions, and many in the astronaut
corps have pointed that out, as the NAS study did as well.

And  I  respect  you  defending  the  position  that  NASA  has  taken,
but I do think that when you look at the relative dangers involved,
and  the  risks  involved  in  these  two  types  of  mission,  that  there  is

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00058 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

55

not a lot of difference between. And I know that there will be many
of us who will continue to advocate that if we are unwilling to take
the  risks  to  go  to  Hubble,  then  what  does  that  say  about  a  Moon
and eventual Mars mission, that there are risks in space travel and
exploration,  as  my  good  friend  Congressman  Hall  pointed  out,  but
there  are  also  ways  to  balance  those  risks  with  the  rewards,  and
Hubble  is  such  a  tremendous  asset,  both  public  relations-wise,  as
well  as  the  science  that  has  been  developed,  that  there  are  many
of us that continue to believe there has to be a way here.

I  made  a  speech  on  top  of  my  questions,  and  I  apologize,  but  if
you  could  briefly  answer  my  questions  about  the  baseline  safe
haven concept that you are pursuing.

Mr. GREGORY. Well, let me give you an initial one sentence, and
then pass it over to Bill Readdy. A safe haven is always an oppor-
tunity  on  the  International  Space  Station.  It  will  always  be  there,
and  whenever  we  dock,  whether  we  have  planned  to  have  it  as  a
safe  haven  or  not,  it  will  always  be  there.  It  will  always  be  there
as  a  contingency,  even  though  we  have  not  planned  to  use  it  as  a
safe haven.

Bill.
Mr.  READDY.  To  provide  a  little  bit  more  detail,  you  are  exactly
right. For the first two flights, we have insisted that we have a safe
haven  available  onboard  the  International  Space  Station,  and  we
are  going  to  assess  exactly  how  many  days  we  have.  As  Mr.  Greg-
ory  mentioned,  what  the  Space  Station  offers  is  the  ability  to  very
deliberately  assess  the  situation  before  you  commit  to  launching
another orbiter.

We  could  certainly  have  another  orbiter  stacked,  ready  to  go  on
another launch pad, but to commit to flying that orbiter to do a res-
cue  mission,  to  do  the  high  wire  act  that  he  talked  about,  a  free
space  transfer  of  crew  members,  suited,  from  one  ship  to  another,
to  commit  to  that  ahead  of  time  we  don’t  think  is  a  prudent  thing
to  do,  and  we  respectfully  disagree  with  the  National  Academies
assessment  of  that  as  trivial.  De  minimis,  I  think,  was  the  term
that they used.

In terms of Space Station having a safe haven capability, on the
28th  of  this  month,  when  the  Progress  launches,  we  will  have  an
ability  to  assess  what  the  safe  haven  capability  is.  Just  for  plan-
ning  purposes,  we  have  been  looking  at  33  days.  That  includes  a
number  of  engineering  analyses  that  we  have  done,  and  counts  on
having failures as soon as you launch the Space Shuttle, of the oxy-
gen  generating  equipment  on  board  the  Space  Station.  When  the
Progress  docks,  we  think  planned  right  now  for  March  2,  we  will
have  a  much  better  assessment,  and  we  would  expect  that  the
number  of  safe  haven  days  aboard  International  Space  Station
would  be  40  plus  days  at  least.  Some  estimates  are  in  the  50s  of
days. That certainly gives you an awful lot of time to very soberly,
very  deliberately  assess  the  commit  to  launch  of  a  rescue  mission.
And  finally,  with  the  Space  Station,  you  can  effect  a  shirtsleeve
transfer  just  as  part  of  our  nominal  operations,  which  we  do  rou-
tinely,  with  the  Space  Shuttle  docked  to  International  Space  Sta-
tion. So I think all of those things are not trivialities, as were kind
of stated by the National Academies.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.

Mr. UDALL. I thank the Chairman for his indulgence. I think this
is  a  very  important  issue,  and  this  discussion  has  been  very  help-
ful.

Chairman BOEHLERT. I agree on both counts. Dr. Ehlers.

RISK ASSESSMENT AND SAFETY

Mr. EHLERS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I had planned to ask the
same  questions.  So  I  will  simply  continue  the  line  of  questioning.
The  Hubble  Telescope  has  been  described  as  the  greatest  ad-
vance in astronomy since Galileo developed the first telescope, and
I think that is probably accurate.

The  Hubble  Telescope,  in  a  week,  would  probably  do  better  and
more  science  than  we  are  likely  to  do  during  the  lifetime  of  the
Space Station. I have yet to see any good description of any impor-
tant,  meaningful  scientific  research  that  we  are  planning  to  up
there,  and  I  would  be—I  would  love  to  be  shown  wrong  on  that.
But  the  Hubble  is  a  real  treasure.  I  believe  Mr.  O’Keefe’s  decision
was  wrong.  I  told  him  that  the  day  after  he  made  it.  And  what  I
see  before  me  now  appears  to  me  very  much  to  be  simply  trying
to justify a decision that I believe was made in haste, and was not
an appropriate decision.

When you talk about the cost as being $2 billion, that is certainly
an  inflated  figure,  when  you  are  able  to  fly,  you  are  talking  about
five flights for $4 billion, why is it $2 billion for the Hubble flight?
And  Mr.  Gregory,  I  have  to  respond  to  your  question  about  abso-
lute  safety.  If  you  are  going  to  insist  on  absolute  safety,  you  are
not going to fly again, and you are definitely not going to send any-
one  to  Mars.  Get  rid  of  the  term  absolute  safety.  There  is  no  such
thing.

There  is  risk  involved  in  going  into  space.  Every  one  of  your  as-
tronauts understands that. I have talked to them personally. I have
asked  a  number  of  astronauts  personally,  would  you  be  willing  to
volunteer  to  go  on  a  Hubble  mission  if  you  were  given  the  oppor-
tunity. None of them I have talked to have said no.

The—I  believe  the  commission  that  studied  the  Columbia  dis-
aster did an excellent job, but I am concerned about the lack of un-
derstanding of risk analysis among the public and many people in-
volved  with  this.  You  cannot  guarantee  absolute  safety.  You  try  to
reduce  the  risk  as  much  as  possible,  but  all  of  you—those  of  you
who  have  been  in  space,  those  of  you  involved  with  this,  recognize
there  is  risk  associated  with  it.  There  is  also  risk  associated  with
me driving my car from my apartment to work, and a sizable risk,
and yet, I do it every day.

We  live  in  a  sea  of  risk,  and  we  try  to  minimize  the  risk,  and
I  appreciate  what  you  are  trying  to  do,  but  I  think—I  am  really
concerned,  not  just  about  the  Hubble,  but  about  the  impact  on
NASA  itself  if  we  get  so  overwhelmed  with  concerns  about  safety
and not—aren’t willing to recognize that there is a risk, and set tol-
erable risk limits, so that you can accomplish your missions. Other-
wise,  as  I  say,  we  are  never  going  to  go  to  Mars,  if  we  continue  to
insist on such low levels of risk. The costs will balloon out of sight,
and the country will not be willing to pay for it.

I—your  analysis—I  can  understand  why  your  analysis  of  risk
might  differ  from  the  NRC’s.  At  the  same  time,  these  are  pretty

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

57

bright people, and they understand this issue. You said in your tes-
timony, the mission was canceled based on analysis of relative risk.
I  would  like  to  see  that  analysis,  if  you  would  provide  that  to  us,
and  see  what  detail  you  went  into,  and  in  what  ways  you  differ
from  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences.  I  would  very  much  like  to
see  you  change  your  position,  and  dedicate  a  flight  to  saving  the
Hubble. I believe the scientific merit of it deserves that chance, and
the risk is no greater than any of the more than 100 missions you
have  already  flown,  and  I  think  although  the  disasters  you  have
had  are  horrible,  you  have  lost  two  flights  out  of  roughly  100,  and
that  is  greater  than  the  risk  you  had  anticipated  when  you  began
flying  the  Shuttle.  But  it  is—I  don’t  want  to  even  say  it  is  an  ac-
ceptable  risk,  but  I  think  you  have  got  a  pretty  good  record,  and
I don’t think you should be ashamed of that. You have shown that
the  Shuttle  is  a  safe  vehicle.  Both  of  these  disasters  can  be  ex-
plained  by  anomalies  that  were  not  foreseen,  and—which  is  what
most  accidents  are  caused  by.  And  you  should  not  be  ashamed  of
your  safety  record.  I  think  it  is  good.  I  think  you  have  really  done
a  good  job,  and  you  have  tried  hard.  And  I  don’t  see  that  much  of
a  risk  in  going  to  the  Hubble  again,  which  you  have  already  done
a couple of times, and I would love to see it happen.

I  appreciate  any  comments  you  are  willing  to  make  in  that  re-
gard.  But  if  you  are  talking  about  28  flights  up  to  the  Space  Sta-
tion,  certainly  one  flight  to  Hubble  is  of  lower  risk  than  28  flights
to  the  Space  Station.  You  are  much  less  likely  to  suffer  a  catas-
trophe  on  one  flight  to  the  Hubble  than  you  are  in  the  28  to  the
Space  Station.  And  I  think  you  have  to  look  at  the  relative  value
of those.

Mr.  GREGORY.  Dr.  Ehlers,  let  us  talk  the  science  part  of  the  rel-
ative value of the Hubble, how it works with the Chandra, with the
Spitzer,  with  the  Swift,  with  the  James  Webb  that  is  coming  up.
Al Diaz would be the appropriate one to respond to the science as-
pect.

Mr. EHLERS. Okay.

HUBBLE AND THE FUTURE OF NASA ASTRONOMY

Mr.  DIAZ.  Well,  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  say  a  few  words
here,  because  both  Mr.  Ehlers  and  Mr.  Udall,  I  think,  with  their
comments, really have confirmed that the work that we have done
on  Hubble  has  produced  exactly  what  we  intended  to,  which  was
world class astronomy for the past 15 years. And having been there
in  1990,  when  Hubble  was  launched,  and  having  been  involved  in
the  development  of  it,  I  am  humbled  by  the  fact  that  it  was  really
the  Space  Shuttle  and  the  Space  Shuttle  crews  that  made  the  dif-
ference  between  Hubble  becoming  space  junk  and  it  being  exactly
as the Academy identified it, as the greatest advance since Galileo.
It has been difficult for the team to accept at times that—the na-
ture  of  the  decision  that  was  made,  but  frankly,  I  think  all  of  us
have  accepted  the  fact  that  in  the  wake  of  the  Columbia  accident,
that it is impossible for the Agency to commit to doing another mis-
sion.  In  fact,  as  the  director  of  the  Goddard  Space  Flight  Center
last year, I was the one that proposed to the Administrator that we
look  at  the  robotic  servicing  of  Hubble,  which  actually  led  to  the
Academy evaluation, and I must say that, in the end, while I might

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00061 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

58

not agree with every one of the recommendations that the Academy
has made, their final conclusion, actually, with respect to the robot-
ics,  is  consistent  with  four  or  five  other  independent  reviews,  that
being  that  the  cost  would  be  very  high,  and  the  $2  billion  number
that you mentioned, that is associated with that robotic mission.

What  we  have  been  forced  to  conclude  is  that  the  discussion
about Hubble really needs to be a discussion about continuing that
world  class  astronomy  program,  and  not  about  the  telescope.  And
I think that—I would suggest to you that the budget that we have
brought  forward,  and  the  strategy  that  it  supports,  is  one  that  is
focused on continuing that world class astronomy program. It clear-
ly  recognizes  the  need  to  continue  the  Hubble  Telescope  activities
as  long  as  possible.  We  believe  that  that  could  extend  into  2008,
at least now, and hopefully, we will be able to manage some devel-
opments  that  might  get  it  to  2009.  The  other  part  of  our  strategy
is  to  keep  the  development  of  the  successor,  or  the  follow-on  tele-
scopes,  for  the  astronomy  program,  on  their  current  schedules  by
investing  in  maintaining  those  schedules,  specifically  with  regard
to  that—the  James  Webb  Space  Telescope,  which  promises  to  con-
tinue every bit of the discovery space that Hubble has.

In addition to that, we intend to continue to support the develop-
ment of other capabilities that might extend the telescope’s life and
continue the support of the archive data. I think it is probably not
well-known, but 40 percent of the discoveries that are reported out
of  Hubble  are  actually  extracted  from  the  archives  that  are  at  the
Space  Telescope  Science  Institute.  And  so  I  think  that  we  have
come  forward  with  a  plan  in  the  2006  budget  that  is,  in  fact,  one
that  promises  to  continue  the  world  class  astronomy  program,  de-
spite  the  fact  that  we  will  no  longer  plan  to  service  the  telescope.
Mr.  EHLERS.  In  the  appropriations  last  year,  Congress  directed
NASA  to  spend  $291  million  on  a  Hubble  servicing  mission.  What
is happening to that money?

Mr. GREGORY. Craig, do you want to—Steve?
Mr.  ISAKOWITZ.  Sir,  I  will  be  happy  to  take  that  one.  Congress
did  identify  $291  million  for  the  purposes  of  robotic  servicing.  In
our  first  operating  plan  letter  that  we  sent  to  the  Congress  that
laid out our plans for fiscal year 2005, we had identified $175 mil-
lion  specifically  so  we  can  do  some  of  this  early  design  work,  look-
ing at the servicing, and now focused on a de-orbit mission that we
think will take us through the March/April timeframe. Our current
plan  now  is  to  assess  where  we  are  at  that  time,  and  determine
what  additional  resources  are  needed  in  this  fiscal  year  to  take  us
through,  and  so  our  plan  is  in  our—as  early  as  our  next  operating
plan,  which  could  be  at  the  end  of  February,  early  March,  to  indi-
cate  to  the  Congress  our  plans  for  how  to  go  forward  through  the
rest of this fiscal year.

Chairman BOEHLERT. I thank the gentleman for his line of ques-

tioning.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Let  me  just  make  a  final  comment.  I  don’t  think  it
makes  sense  to  try  to  use  robotics  to  continue  the  Hubble.  The
costs and the likelihood of success, I think, are too small.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, the timing, too, is also a factor.
Mr.  EHLERS.  Right.  But  I—yes,  but  I  do  strongly  support  a
manned or womanned mission to continue the Hubble. I think you

59

get  a  lot  of  good  out  of  it  for  a  fairly  small  investment.  I  am  fully
aware of the other advanced telescopes that are going up, but there
is  a  gap  between—there  will  be  a  large  gap  between  the  Hubble,
end  of  the  Hubble,  and  the  beginning  of  the  James  Webb  at  this
point, and I would like to see that gap filled.

I  am  just  concerned,  as  I  said,  that  the  decision  was  made—I
don’t  think  it  was  made  on  a  sound  basis,  and  now,  I  have  seen
NASA  ever  since  then  try  to  defend  that  decision,  and  come  up
with  arguments  of  why  that  decision  was  right,  rather  than  really
going back and honestly re-examining whether or not it was right.
And I would certainly appreciate an honest re-examination of that.
With  28  flights  going  up,  as  Mr.  Udall  said,  it  seems  you  could
spare one for the Hubble, and I don’t think that the risks are going
to  be  very  much,  if  any  greater,  than  any  of  the  other  28  flights.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. I thank the gentleman, and I want to rein-
force  his  request,  Mr.  Gregory.  The  Committee  would  formally  re-
quest that you share with us the risk report.

Mr. GREGORY. Yes, sir.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much.  The  Chair  recog-

nizes Mr. Honda.

CENTER TRANSFORMATION AND THE NASA WORKFORCE

Mr. HONDA. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and welcome, Ad-
ministrator  Gregory.  Well,  all  this  line  of  question  has  been  very
interesting  for  me,  because  this  is  probably  one  of  the  first  times
that  we  really  had  some  detailed  discussions,  but  I  am  still  not
clear on a lot of areas. When I first visited NASA Ames through—
facility  in  Mountain  View,  some  of  the  comments  I  heard  while
walking  around  there  was  this  terminology  called,  what  is  it,  full
cost  accounting  and  its  impact  on  the  way  our  skills  and  our  folks
are  being  distributed  or  redistributed,  and  then,  I  am  reading
about this term transformation.

I  guess  my  question  is,  I  would  like  to  understand  how  you  see
the  impact  of  transformation  on  existing  contracts,  including  the
research contracts and cooperative agreements, especially the kinds
that we have had developed at NASA Ames in Mountain View with
UC–Santa  Cruz,  or  San  Jose  State,  with  Carnegie  Mellon,  and
those  others.  Will  NASA  be  fully  honoring  its  existing  obligations,
and  you  know,  and  the  reason  I  am  asking  is  because  I  am  con-
cerned about the dissolution of that collaboration, relative to its im-
pact  on  the  kinds  of  science  that  we  need  to  see,  and  relative  to
the  kind  of  education  I  want  to  see  happen  from  that  point  down
into  the  public  schools.  And  it  just—I  am  not  quite  sure  what  all
the  details  of  your  plan  is  to  achieve  your  vision,  and  it  seems  to
me  that  everything  seems  to  be  served,  in  my  mind,  disconnected
or haphazard.

And then, I have one more other question, that I will ask, so that
I  won’t  get  stopped  by  the  red  light.  In  looking  at  the  vision  and
the  mission  of  sending—going  back  to  the  Moon  and  to  Mars,  and
it  has  been  about  two  years  now,  since  we  have  had  this  activity
in front of us, has anybody done a plan, if you will, that would map
out,  in  a  backward  fashion,  from  achievement  of  the  goal,  working
it  backwards  and  figuring  out  what  the  steps  are,  and  developed

a  PERT  chart,  program  review  evaluation  technique,  that  they
have  used  in  the  development  of  the  nuclear  submarine,  which
turned  out  to  be  a  very  good  technique  for  moving  a  complex
project  such  as  this.  Do  you  have  that?  Is  that  something  that  we
can visit or see, or be shared with Members here, so that the com-
plexity  of  the  project  can  sort  of  be  grasped  by  our  minds,  because
right  now,  there  are  so  many  parts  of  it,  it  appears  to  be—there
is costs, and there is personnel attached to it, and changing of tech-
niques  that—it  seems  to  be  very  disorienting,  I  think,  for  a  lot  of
people. And that is my questions.

Mr.  GREGORY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Honda.  I  think  it  would  appro-
priate to have Al Diaz respond to the activities at Ames, and then,
we will have Craig Steidle address the second portion of your ques-
tion.

Mr.  DIAZ.  First,  let  me  say  that  in  my  visits  to  Ames  recently,
I  have  recognized  that  the  center  has  transformed  itself  dramati-
cally over the course of the past five years of so when I previously
visited.  It  is  a  new  addition  to  the  science  family,  and  the  center
director and I have been having almost daily, if—well, weekly, any-
how, interactions about the transformation that is ongoing.

It—with regard to the agreements, I must say that I have not re-
viewed all of the agreements. Although the Center Director has not
indicated to me that there are any agreements that are in jeopardy
because of the current transformation, or full cost accounting. What
I would like to do is take the opportunity of your question to review
that with him, and get back to you with a full report.

NASA FULL COST ACCOUNTING

Mr. HONDA. Just a real quick question. In that full cost account-
ing,  how  does  that  allow  NASA  to  attain  its  vision,  say,  in  terms
of  the  arena  of  nanoscale  activities,  which  to  me  seems  to  be  very
essential  in  developing  materials  for  space  flight  and  things  like
that,  so  you  have  a  lighter  vehicle,  but  stronger,  and  capable  of
probably  lifting  greater  payloads.  So  it  seems  like  we  are  cutting
out certain arenas that will affect future needs.

Mr. DIAZ. Well, I may not be the right one to talk about full cost
accounting in general, and so if there is any further comment, that
might be appropriate to Steve Isakowitz. But I do come from a cen-
ter  that  does  a  fair  amount  of  research  at  the  Goddard  Space
Flight Center, and I have been associated with work that has been
done at JPL. Fundamentally, there is no inconsistency between full
cost  accounting  and  research  type  activities.  The  issue  is  making
sure that we understand exactly what the cost is that is associated
with  all  of  those  activities,  including  the  workforce  cost.  Typically,
that has been the cost that—the cost of the workforce, and the cost
of  overhead,  that  hasn’t  been  properly  accounted  for.  I  think  that
the  transition  to  full  cost  has  created  some,  if  you  will,  some  new
understanding  of  how  high  the  cost  actually  is  that  is  associated
with doing some of our research, when it is compared to other orga-
nizations that already do full cost accounting, like JPL or external
organizations.

And maybe Steve would want to comment on it.
Mr. HONDA. But not being argumentative, it appears that in that
full  cost  accounting,  that  you  are  forcing  through  budgetary  ac-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00064 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

61

tions, some elimination of necessary skills within our organization.
Even  though  there  may  be  other  organizations  that  operate  under
full  cost  accounting,  they  are  more  of  a  privatized  organization
versus  NASA,  which  is  more  government-run,  and  more  research-
oriented,  where  you  do  a  lot  of  research,  and  you  know,  that  may
come  up  with  some  outcomes  that  would  be  necessary  for  space
flight. It is just—it just is an observation.

Mr. DIAZ. I understand what you are saying, and I think we are
trying  to  be  careful  about  that,  but  let  me  turn  it  over  to  Steve  at
this point.

Mr. ISAKOWITZ. I think Al Diaz had it exactly right. Full cost ac-
counting is an accounting tool. It provides to managers the insight
on  the  full  cost  of  what  it  takes  to  accomplish  their  specific  pro-
gram  and  project  goals.  With  that  information,  managers  are  then
in  a  position  to  determine  whether  or  not  it  makes  sense  to  con-
tinue  to  make  the  investments  inside  the  Agency  or  another.  But
in and of itself, full cost doesn’t force us to take any specific action.
It  does,  for  the  first  time,  though,  give  us  the  insight  as  to  what
the cost is for the skills we need and the facilities we need in order
to execute our programs.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much.  The  gentleman’s

time has expired.

Mr. HONDA. Just very quickly, Mr. Chairman. I would like to sit
down  with  you,  and  continue  the  debate,  because  you  can  have  a
budget-driven  organization  and  miss  your  target,  because  you  are
on  budget,  and—but  you  are  not  going  to  be  on  target  as  far  as
your mission is concerned.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  The  gentleman’s  time  has  expired.  There
has  been  considerable  discussion  this  morning  about  risk,  and  as
we  all  know,  there  is  risk  in  everything,  including  being  in  this
room  for  a  prolonged  period  of  time.  It  is  more  conducive  to  a  dis-
cussion  of  our  polar  program.  In  any  event,  nothing  is  ever  simple
in  Congress.  We  don’t  have  control  over  the  thermostat.  We  have
checked with higher authorities, and have been advised by the Su-
perintendent  of  Buildings  that  someone  will  be  dispatched  to  turn
up  the  thermostat,  and  they  will  probably  arrive  just  as  we  ad-
journ,  so  if  you  can  bear  with  us  a  few  more  minutes,  I  would  ap-
preciate it.

Mr. Costa.

NASA PRIORITIES AND ROADMAPPING

Mr. COSTA. I will make one statement, though. Sir, you have al-
ready turned up the heat, and so I don’t think anyone at this table
is chilly.

I  am  sorry,  sir.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  am  new
to the Committee, and hopefully, we will keep the temperature just
about right.

But  in  listening  carefully  to  the  questions  that  have  been  asked
this  morning,  it  seems  to  me  what  we  really  haven’t  come  to  the
heart  to,  is  what  do  we  really  want  to  make  the  basic  mission  of
NASA for the next five or ten year period, notwithstanding the pro-
nouncements  of  the  President’s  with  regards  to  the  Moon  explo-
ration  and  Mars,  it  just  seems  to  me  that  trying  to  get  a  handle,
and a consistent, clear view on our manned space program and all

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

62

that  that  entails,  versus  our  other  efforts  with  our  exploratory  as-
tronomy,  that  we  have  yet  to  reach  a  consensus  as  to  just  exactly
what  NASA’s  mission  needs  to  be  over  the  course  of  the  next  ten
years.

I  mean,  the  budget  is  what  the  budget  is,  and  you  know,  it  will
vary, based upon our other priorities, but once we have made a de-
cision  on  that,  you  have  got  a  set  amount  of  dollars  to  deal  with,
and  it  seems  to  me  the  underpinning  of  the  basic  hard  question
that we seem to discuss around, and I am supportive of the Hubble
effort  as  well,  but  we  need  to  complete  the  Space  Station,  I  think.
And  the  problem,  it  seems  to  me,  is  we  basically  haven’t  decided
what the primary mission or missions of NASA is going to be over
the  course  of  the  next  ten  years.  And  notwithstanding  a  lot  of—
what a lot of people’s agenda or ideas are—and so I guess I would
like  you  to  maybe  try  to  indicate  to  us  in  terms  of  what  steps  you
are  taking  to  attempt  to  prioritize,  notwithstanding  your  funding,
where you think the manned program fits with the other priorities
that are there.

I  mean,  it  just  seems  like  a  whole  lot  of  things  that  have  been
thrown  against  the  wall  at  this  point  in  time,  and  we  are  all  very
proud  of  NASA  and  the  accomplishments  that  you  have  achieved
over  the  decades,  and  obviously  want  to  see  that  continue,  but
without  a  clear  and  concise  consensus,  I  am  not  so  sure  that  we
are going to make much progress.

Mr.  GREGORY.  Thank  you.  Thank  you,  sir,  that  was  an  excellent
question,  and  it  is  an  area  that  we  have  not  touched  on.  It  is  cer-
tainly one that we really need to inform all of us about.

A while ago, in pursuit of the answer, we—the senior leaders de-
cided  that  what  we  needed  to  do  would  be  to  develop  roadmaps,
and  we—in  fact,  we  have  13  of  those.  And  each  of  the  roadmap
teams  has  a  person  from  outside  of  NASA,  from  academia,  or  in-
dustry.  We  have  a  center  director,  in  general,  and  we  also  have
several  of  the  members  of  this  table  as  co-chairs,  on  each  of  these
roadmaps.  And  each  of  them  is  looking  at  the  future  to  determine
what the future should be, and then, there is an—or a goal, as the
agency moves forward.

And then, there is an activity where we integrate all of these to-
gether, to come out with a single or several absolute goals that the
agency would be holding our feet to the fire on. That is an activity,
also,  in  work.  And  it  is  one  of  many  activities  in  the  agency  that
we  have  to  make—decisions  that  we  have  to  make  that,  again,
gives  us  not  10  years,  but  probably  30  or  50  years  in  the  future,
to talk about how the agency, this great agency of NASA, provides
a significant value to the population, not of the United States—not
only  of  the  United  States,  but  of  the  world.  And  it  is  an  activity,
it  is  an  ongoing  activity.  We  have  short-term  goals  and  short-term
goals take us out to 2020, 2030. It follows on the question that Mr.
Honda  just  asked,  about  the  goals  in  the  future,  and  how  you
work—how  you  come  back  from  that  to  determine  what  we  do  on
the Space Station, what we have to learn from the Earth, what we
will learn from the Moon, as we progress to Mars.

And  if  you  would,  sir,  the  person  who  is  responsible  for  that  in
the agency is Craig Steidle, and if it is okay, I will ask him to give
you some further comments.

Mr.  COSTA.  I  would  specifically  like  to  know  what  timeline  you
are  focused  on,  in  terms  of  internally  making  these  recommenda-
tions to the Committee and to the Congress, as to where you think
the  priorities  of  NASA  should  be  in  the  next  30  years,  using  your
timeline.

Admiral  STEIDLE.  Yes,  sir.  We  formed  the  13  roadmaps,  as  Mr.
Gregory pointed out, such as robotic and human exploration of the
lunar  surface,  robotic  and  human  exploration  of  Mars,  transpor-
tation systems, launch systems, in space systems, and then we are
going  to  integrate  those  particular  roadmaps.  We—each  one  of
those  teams  have  been  formulated.  They  are  FACA,  so  they  are
open to the public. We have had a meeting of each one of the road-
maps,  the  last  one  being  the  nuclear  roadmap,  which  I  chair  as
well,  yesterday.  We  will  have  a  second  meeting  of  those,  and  try
and  complete  those,  by  the  middle  of  April.  And  then  we  will  inte-
grate  those,  and  take  them  this  summer  to  the  National  Academy
for review.

And that should set, in very, very high terms, our strategic direc-
tion  for  the  future.  And  that  is—those  are  going  to  be  living  docu-
ments which will be reviewed on a reoccurring basis. That will also
translate  to  technology  investments  and  requirements  below  those
strategies, to support those in the future, which will lead to our in-
vestment  strategies  and  our  budgets  of  the  future.  So  to  answer
your  question,  they  are  coming  together,  the  first  blush  will  be
completed  in  the  second  in  the  second  meetings,  by  around  April,
mid-April timeframe, and then to the National Academy as soon as
we can get it scheduled, early summer.

Mr. COSTA. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

FUTURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WITHOUT

THE SPACE SHUTTLE

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Mr.  Gregory,  I  want  to  commend  you  for
the  skillful  manner  you  handled  the  newest  Member  of  our  com-
mittee. That is an excellent question you asked.

I  have  got  a  few  brief  questions  here  that  don’t  require  long  an-
swers,  and  I  would  like  to  ask  them  now.  Does  NASA  have  a
backup plan for constructing the Space Station, if the Shuttle can-
not remain in service?

Mr. GREGORY. And—you are referencing some time between now

and 2010, if we lose the——

Chairman BOEHLERT. Right.
Mr. GREGORY.—capability.
Chairman BOEHLERT. That is correct.
Mr.  GREGORY.  This  is  a—certainly  a  question  that  Bill  Readdy
would,  and  can  answer.  I  can  tell  you,  though,  that  the  resiliency
of the Agency and the industry that supports the Agency would an-
swer, if we lose another Shuttle, that we would still be able to com-
plete  the  International  Space  Station,  with  the  two  remaining.
Each time we have lost a Shuttle—each time we have preceded the
lost of a Shuttle, we had told ourselves that if we lose another one,
we  can  never  proceed,  or  we  can’t  proceed.  But  in  each  case,  we
have.  Now,  we  have  come  out  a  stronger  Agency  each  time.  But
Bill, let me pass that to you, and see what your response would be.

Mr.  READDY.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  I—if  your  question  is  the
unique  capabilities  of  the  Shuttle,  not  only  to  take  these  modules,
and provide the right launch environment for them, haul the cargo,
the crew, be the base for the robotics operation with the robot arm,
and conduct assembly spacewalks, really, there is no alternative to
that.  In  testimony  before  the  Senate  here  some  months  ago,  the
same  question  was  raised,  and  our  estimate  are  that  in  order  to
provide  an  alternative  launch  capability,  we  are  talking  about  on
the order of $1 billion to repackage those elements to launch in an-
other capacity, and that doesn’t include replicating the robotics ca-
pability, or hosting the spacewalks required.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  All  right.  Let  me  ask  you  then,  do  you
have  a  backup  plan  for  servicing  the  Space  Station  if  changes  are
not made to the INA?

Mr.  READDY.  Well,  clearly,  we  have  worked  together  as  a  part-
nership, and the strength of the partnership, I think, is something
that  we  are  all  extremely  proud  of,  over  these  last  four  years,  or
these  last  two  years  since  the  accident,  and  we  are  now  entering
our  fifth  year  of  permanent  presence  on  board  the  International
Space  Station.  Clearly,  we  didn’t  anticipate  losing  the  Shuttle.  We
didn’t  anticipate  having  to  rely  exclusively  on  the  Progress  resup-
ply  vehicle,  and  that  has  stretched  our  logistic  supply  line  very
thin. Fortunately, the Ariane 5 launched successfully on Saturday,
this  past  Saturday.  That  is  the  launcher  for  the  Autonomous
Transfer  Vehicle  that  the  Europeans  are  providing.  That  will  pro-
vide us an additional leg of redundancy, and resilience in our abil-
ity to resupply the Space Station. The Japanese HTV, their launch
vehicle  right  now  is  planned  for  Return-to-Flight  here  on  the  24th
of this month, and so we have several legs of redundancy, in terms
of  being  able  to  provide  resupply  for  the  International  Space  Sta-
tion.  And  then  finally,  what  we  intend  to  issue,  in  terms  of  a  re-
quest for proposal this summer, and complete a contract by the end
of  this  calendar  year,  is  commercial  ISS  crew  and  cargo  services,
which would, of course, be open to our industry.

COST ESTIMATES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CREW

EXPLORATION VEHICLE

Chairman BOEHLERT. Last year, NASA set its rough estimate for
the  total  cost  of  developing  the  CEV  was  $15  billion.  Is  that  still
a good number?

Admiral STEIDLE. Yes, sir. It is in the realm of putting the Crew
Exploration  Vehicle  forward  and  with  the  demonstrations  in  14,
and  the  crewed  version  of  that  15  to  16  is  what  we  have  been  log-
ging in our books, sir.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  And  when  would  you  think  would  be  a
good time for Congress to assess the progress in building the CEV,
so we could pull the plug if, and I hope this would not be the case,
if  it  does  not  appear  to  be  moving  ahead  successfully  at  a  reason-
able cost?

Admiral  STEIDLE.  I  think  the  most  appropriate  time  would  be  a
major  design  review  that  we  hold  in  the  summer  of  ’06.  At  that
particular  time,  we  will  have  the  two  contractor  teams  that  will
enough specificity in their proposals, and we will hold a design re-
view in the summer of ’06 for a total review of the program.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Frederick D. Gregory, Deputy Administrator, National Aeronautics and

Space Administration (NASA)

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. Last  year,  the  Congressional  Budget  Office  (CBO)  completed  a  budgetary  anal-
ysis of NASA’s proposed new vision for space exploration, which concluded that
the potential cost growth through 2020, based on NASA’s history, is between $32
billion and $61 billion. What specific steps are being implemented to ensure that
NASA’s  cost  estimates  for  space  exploration  are  as  accurate  as  possible?  What
specific  steps  are  being  implemented  to  identify  cost  growth  risks  and  manage
those risks?

A1. NASA  appreciates  the  analyses  performed  by  the  Congressional  Budget  Office
(CBO) in their report A Budgetary Analysis of NASA’s New Vision for Space Explo-
ration  (CBO,  September,  2004),  which  ‘‘are  intended  to  illustrate  potential  upper
bounds’’ to NASA’s budget projections for the Vision for Space Exploration. CBO as-
sumes  a  45  percent  cost-growth  risk  factor,  and  applies  that  factor  to  the  costs  of
human  lunar  exploration  activities  and  robotic  support  missions.  CBO’s  derivation
of  this  factor  is  based  on  72  historical  NASA  programs.  The  results  of  the  CBO  re-
port  could  represent  a  ‘‘potential  upper  bound’’  for  cost  growth,  but  CBO  does  not
address what may be the expected levels of cost growth. NASA believes that the ex-
pected cost growth will be much less than the ‘upper bound’ estimated by CBO, and
will be manageable while still achieving the goal in the Vision for Space Exploration
of  returning  humans  to  the  Moon  by  2020.  The  CBO  states  in  their  report,  ‘‘It  is
certainly  not  a  foregone  conclusion  that  technical  programs  such  as  those  involved
in  NASA’s  exploration  initiative  will  experience  serious  cost-growth  problems.  The
Apollo  project  is  a  case  in  point. . .exceeding  the  budget  laid  out  in  1961  by  only
about  seven  percent.’’  NASA  disagrees  with  some  of  the  assumptions  used  by  CBO
to  arrive  at  their  ‘upper  bound,’  and  already  has  strategies  in  place  to  ensure  that
costs  are  managed  and  that  actual  costs  will  be  no  where  near  the  upper  bound  of
potential cost growth estimated by CBO.

The  cost  of  any  complex  undertaking  is  highly  dependent  upon  the  underlying
technical and programmatic architecture. With respect to NASA’s new initiatives in
human  exploration,  the  Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate  (ESMD),  in  part-
nership with industry through the Concept Exploration & Refinement contracts, has
been  evaluating  various  alternative  architectures  with  regards  to  sustainability,
cost,  reliability,  safety,  etc.  In  order  to  ensure  that  cost  estimates  are  credible
ESMD  is  embarking  on  a  three-pronged  strategy.  First,  the  Directorate  is  devel-
oping a cost analysis career plan (in partnership with the NASA Cost Analysis Divi-
sion  of  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Financial  Officer)  that  will  delineate  the  knowledge,
training,  and  job  experiences  that  cost  estimators  should  have  in  order  to  ade-
quately  perform  their  function.  Second,  ESMD  is  funding  the  development  of  new
and improved cost tools that expand our capability to generate estimates and under-
stand  the  underlying  cost  drivers.  Third,  ESMD  is  establishing  a  policy  that  re-
quires independent cost estimates, both from within and from outside NASA at key
decision milestones. This policy also institutionalizes cost estimating as a necessary
part of effective program management.

NASA has taken a number of steps to address independent technical and cost as-
sessments  at  the  agency  level  in  addition  to  the  steps  identified  above.  First,  the
Agency is adding new tools, procedures, and personnel to the Independent Program
Assessment  Office  (IPAO)  to  independently  review  projects  at  critical  milestones.
The  IPAO  reports  to  the  Chief  Engineer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  both  of  whom
are  adding  personnel  in  this  area.  Second,  NASA  has  revised  and  released  its  pro-
gram  management  handbook  (NPR  7120.5C)  which  includes  clear  decision  mile-
stones to determine if projects will proceed to the next phases of development. These
milestones  are  supported  by  independent  technical  and  cost  reviews.  Third,  the
Agency  strengthened  its  safety  and  mission  assurance  organization  by  creating  an
Independent  Technical  Authority  (ITA)  at  all  NASA  field  Centers  and  establishing
the  NASA  Engineering  and  Safety  Center  to  enhance  independent  safety  and  engi-
neering  oversight.  Fourth,  NASA  has  benchmarked  its  cost  estimating  practices
against  other  organizations,  including  Department  of  Defense,  and  will  be  intro-
ducing improved earned value management requirements later this summer. NASA
has  established  a  policy  requiring  independent  cost  estimates  at  Pre-Non  Advocate
Review  and  Non  Advocate  Review  milestones,  has  implemented  Continuous  Cost-
Risk Management, which requires project estimates to be developed during formula-

69

tion.  This  estimate  can  be  referred  to  during  project  management  reviews  and  up-
dated at critical milestones.
Q2. In  your  written  testimony  you  are  very  cautious  in  stating  that  the  Shuttle  re-
turn-to-flight  date  could  occur  ‘‘as  early  as  May  2005.’’  How  certain  are  you  at
this  point  that  you  can  meet  that  date?  Many  inside  and  outside  NASA  have
said that they are less worried about the success of the first flight than they are
that  something  could  be  learned  on  that  flight  that  presages  future  problems.
Could you comment on that?

A2. On February 18, 2005, the NASA Space Flight Leadership Council reviewed the
progress  being  made  to  ensure  a  safe  Return-to-Flight  and  approved  a  launch  date
of  May  15,  2005  for  STS–114.  All  major  flight  hardware  is  at  the  Kennedy  Space
Center  in  Florida  and  being  processed  through  a  normal  pre-launch  flow.  Mean-
while,  the  independent  Return-to-Flight  Task  Group  (RTFTG)  continues  to  assess
NASA’s  efforts  to  meet  the  fifteen  Return-to-Flight  recommendations  made  by  the
Columbia  Accident  Investigation  Board  (CAIB).  The  RTFTG  met  in  a  plenary  ses-
sion  on  March  29–31,  2005,  to  consider  the  remaining  open  CAIB  Return-to-Flight
activities. In the words of RTFTG co-chair Richard Covey, ‘‘Right now, we don’t see
anything  that  stands  in  front  of  the  agency  that  can’t  be  accomplished  in  order  to
make the May–June [2005] launch window.’’

NASA is committed to making the last flight of the Space Shuttle system at least
as  safe  as  the  Return-to-Flight  mission.  All  flights  will  be  driven  by  safety  mile-
stones.  If  there  is  any  indication  that  additional  work  needs  to  be  done  to  meet
those milestones, then the Space Shuttle program will take whatever measures are
appropriate  to  ensure  that  those  milestones  are  met—up  to  and  including  delaying
launches, if necessary.
Q3. You  were  clear  in  your  testimony  today  that  the  Shuttle  will  be  retired  by  the
end  of  2010.  But  in  comments  to  the  press,  other  top  NASA  officials  have  been
much less firm. Is NASA’s position that it will retire the Space Shuttle in 2010?
Are there any circumstances under which NASA would fly the Shuttle after De-
cember 31, 2010?

A3. The  President  stated  on  January  14,  2004:  ‘‘In  2010,  the  Space  Shuttle—after
nearly 30 years of duty—will be retired from service.’’ To enable the 2010 retirement
date,  NASA  is  examining  configurations  for  the  Space  Station  that  meet  the  needs
of  both  the  Space  Exploration  Vision  and  our  international  partners  using  as  few
Shuttle flights as possible.
Q4. You  say  in  your  testimony  that  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  (CEV)  ‘‘promises
safer  travel.’’  Safer  than  what?  How  will  you  measure  that?  Will  a  risk  level  be
specified in the requirements for the CEV?

A4. The  Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate’s  Level  1  Crew  Transportation
System  Requirements  (Rev  D)  establishes  thresholds  and  objectives  for  the  safety
performance of the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and its associated human rated
launch  system.  These  preliminary  requirements  establish  the  failure  tolerance  de-
sign  criteria  for  the  system  against  the  loss  of  successful  mission  completion,  non-
life-threatening  injuries,  or  significant  damage  to  the  system.  The  key  measure  in
terms  of  safety  is  crew  survivability.  The  preliminary  requirements  include  a  re-
quirement that the predicted analytical crew survivability during ascent be 99,9325
percent with a 50 percent confidence level.

The  CEV  safety  thresholds  have  been  established  such  that  the  vehicle  will  be

safer than current systems including the Space Shuttle.
Q5. Does  NASA  intend  to  close  any  wind  tunnels  this  year,  in  FY  2006  or  in  FY

2007?

A5. NASA  will  not  close  any  wind  tunnels  in  FY  2005  as  directed  by  Congress  in
the  Conference  Report  accompanying  the  FY  2005  Consolidated  Appropriations  Act
(H. Rpt. 108–792). However, beginning in FY 2006, NASA cannot sustain the exist-
ing  suite  of  NASA  ground  test  facilities  and  wind  tunnels  with  the  FY  2006  aero-
nautics budget as submitted. Hence, on January 28, 2005, the Aeronautics Research
Mission  Directorate  instituted  a  corporate  management  model  for  its  wind  tunnel
facilities  to  enable  an  Agency-wide  assessment  of  these  needs.  From  the  existing
suite  of  facilities,  the  FY  2006  Vehicle  Systems  Program  requires  the  use  of  only
a  few  facilities  for  ground  and  test  flight  assets  necessary  to  support  aircraft  and
engine  noise  reduction,  remotely  operated  aircraft  design,  development,  and  oper-
ations,  and  the  development  of  electric  (fuel  cell)  based  power  systems  for  an  all-
electric aircraft.

There  are  up  to  20  ground  test  facilities  and  capabilities  that  may  no  longer  be
necessary  to  support  the  aeronautics  research  program,  including  most  of  NASA’s
large  wind  tunnels  and  engine  test  cells.  Changes  in  operational  status  of  these  20
facilities are needed by the start of FY 2006.

Numerous other capabilities/facilities are to be retained and invested in as appro-
priate. These are the capabilities required to support research activities in Airspace
Systems  and  Aviation  Safety  and  Security  Programs  and  are  primarily  information
technology  based  infrastructure,  such  as  simulators,  communication  systems  and
human factors laboratory capability.
Q6. Your testimony says that the Space Shuttle mission to the Hubble was canceled
‘‘based  on  analysis  of  the  relative  risks’’?  As  requested  during  the  hearing  by
Congressman  Ehlers,  please  provide  a  copy  of  this  analysis.  Can  you  describe
how  it  differs  from  the  analysis  by  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  in  its  re-
port on the Hubble?

A6. Please  refer  to  the  letter  from  NASA  to  Chairman  Boehlert  dated  March  14,
2005, for additional information related to this topic.

The  decision  not  to  pursue  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission  to  the  Hubble  was  based
on  a  relative  risk  analysis  and  operational  complexity.  The  National  Academy  of
Sciences  (NAS)  report  recommended  a  Shuttle-based  servicing  mission  for  Hubble,
and concluded that a Shuttle flight to Hubble was not significantly more risky than
a  Shuttle  flight  to  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS).  Yet  while  all  space  flight
is inherently risky, there are both on-orbit and ground processing requirements that
would  be  notably  unique  to  a  Hubble  servicing  mission.  While  similar  issues  (ther-
mal protection system inspection and repair, contingency Shuttle crew support, and
potentially rescue) exist for missions to the ISS, they can be mitigated more easily,
in part due to the increased time available for understanding and responding to an
emergency situation at the Station. For a Hubble servicing mission, the options and
available  time  for  dealing  with  an  on-orbit  emergency  are  greatly  reduced,  posing
additional risk to the mission.

NASA has developed a five-point flight rationale (addressing safety requirements)
for Space Shuttle RTF, which is grounded in the recommendations of the CAIB and

predicated  on  primary  hazard  control,  warning  devices  and  special  procedures.  The
first two elements of that flight rationale (Elimination of Critical Debris and Impact
Detection During Ascent) rely upon Space Shuttle hardware, infrastructure, and pro-
cedural improvements that broadly apply to all missions, including those to destina-
tions  other  than  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS).  However,  the  efforts  of  the
Space  Shuttle  program  to  meet  the  three  remaining  elements  of  the  RTF  flight  ra-
tionale  (On-Orbit  Debris  Impact/Damage  Detection;  On-Orbit  Thermal  Protection
System Repair; and, Crew Rescue) assume access to the resources of the ISS. Devel-
oping the additional capabilities necessary to meet these three elements of the flight
rationale for a Hubble servicing mission would entail additional risks above and be-
yond those inherent in a mission to the ISS.

The  ISS  provides  Space  Shuttle  managers  with  three  critical  capabilities  not
found  in  autonomous  missions.  First,  the  ISS  serves  as  an  independent  observing
platform  for  assessing  the  integrity  of  the  Space  Shuttle’s  Thermal  Protection  Sys-
tem  (TPS).  Second,  the  ISS  can  operate  as  an  independent  working  platform  from
which Space Shuttle crews can conduct repairs to the TPS if necessary. Finally, the
ISS provides redundancy as a safe haven platform capable of sustaining a stranded
Space  Shuttle  crew  for  a  significantly  longer  period  of  time  than  the  Shuttle  alone
can.

To  apply  this  same  flight  rationale  to  a  Hubble  servicing  mission,  NASA  would
have  to  develop  new  capabilities  that  are  analogous  to  those  provided  by  the  ISS.
The Orbiter Boom Sensor System would have to be extensively modified, or an alter-
native capability would need to be created. Specifically, there would have to be new
hardware  and  procedures  to  provide  space-walking  astronauts  a  platform  from
which  to  effect  repairs  to  a  damaged  TPS,  without  increasing  the  risk  of  further
damaging  the  Orbiter.  Additionally,  a  way  would  need  to  be  found  to  sustain  the
crew  of  a  hopelessly  crippled  Orbiter  with  limited  life-support  capabilities  long
enough  for  a  second  Shuttle  to  be  launched  on  a  rescue  mission.  That  rescue  mis-
sion, in turn, would need to be processed at the same time as the Hubble servicing
mission itself, a situation which would be highly complex, would require double the
normal workload on ground launch and processing teams, and would put an unprec-
edented  strain  on  the  overall  Shuttle  system.  Finally,  a  rescue  mission  would  re-
quire  many  unproven  techniques,  such  as  emergency  free-space  crew  transfer  in
space suits while performing Space Shuttle to Space Shuttle station-keeping. Being
based at the ISS offers the advantages of multiple hatches, airlocks, and established
docking  and  evacuation  procedures,  which  would  afford  a  shirt-sleeve,  nominal
transfer of crew from the ISS to the rescue Orbiter.

New  capabilities  would  need  to  be  built,  tested,  and  validated  before  Hubble  had
degraded to the point where any reasonable repair effort would be impossible. Seek-
ing  to  develop  and  validate  these  new  capabilities  in  time  for  Hubble  servicing,  as
well as process a second launch, is contrary to the milestone-driven approach NASA
has adopted in response to the CAIB recommendations.

Based on analysis of the relative risks, operational complexity and implicit sched-
ule  pressure,  in  February  2004,  NASA  decided  not  to  proceed  with  a  Shuttle  serv-
icing  mission  of  Hubble.  The  new  NASA  Administrator  has  stated  his  intention  to
revisit  this  earlier  decision  in  light  of  what  NASA  learns  after  the  Shuttle  returns
to flight.

Q7. How  does  NASA  intend  to  use  the  money  proposed  for  crew  and  cargo  services
for  the  Station?  When  does  NASA  expect  the  first  commercial  cargo  mission  to
launch? What is NASA specifically doing to develop additional service providers
beyond the Russians?

A7. A  portion  of  the  money  in  the  ISS  Cargo/Crew  services  line  will  likely  be  used
to procure Soyuz crew transportation services, if Congress agrees to a legislative so-
lution to the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 (INA). Over the last several months,
NASA has been participating in an interagency coordination process related to INA,
which seeks to protect our nonproliferation objectives while advancing potential U.S.
cooperation with Russia on the Vision for U.S. Space Exploration. The results of this
interagency coordination process will be presented to Congress shortly.

The  balance  will  be  used  to  acquire  commercial  cargo  transportation  services.
NASA  is  developing  a  Request  for  Proposal  (RFP)  to  be  released  in  2005.  The  RFP
will seek to develop an initial operating capability for commercial services for cargo
transportation  to  the  ISS  before  Space  Shuttle  retirement.  NASA  will  also  utilize
partner capabilities for cargo transportation. The European Automated Transfer ve-
hicle will make its first visit to the ISS in 2006. The Japanese H2A Transfer Vehicle
is also in development.
Q8. NASA  has  discussed  the  possibility  of  launching  the  James  Webb  Space  Tele-
scope on a foreign rocket, the Ariane. It is my understanding that the Europeans
have  offered  to  provide  the  Ariane  launcher  as  well  as  an  infrared  instrument
in exchange for 15 percent of the tasking time on Webb. Is this accurate? Please
provide  the  terms  and  conditions  for  this  arrangement.  The  President’s  Space
Transportation  Policy  requires  that  use  of  a  foreign  launcher  be  coordinated
through  an  interagency  process.  Has  the  interagency  coordination  process  been
initiated?  When  does  NASA  need  to  know  which  launcher  it  will  use  if  it  is  to
deliver Webb on schedule and within cost?

A8. The  James  Webb  Space  Telescope  (JWST)  is  envisioned  to  be  an  international
mission  involving  significant  contributions  from  the  European  Space  Agency  (ESA)
and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). This is consistent with the Vision for Space
Exploration,  announced  by  the  President  on  January  14,  2004,  which  directs  the
pursuit  of  opportunities  for  international  participation  to  support  U.S.  space  explo-
ration  goals.  NASA  pursues  foreign  cooperation  on  science  missions  for  mutual  sci-
entific  benefit  on  a  no-exchange-of-funds  basis,  and  considers  scientific  merit,  engi-
neering  practicality,  industrial  capability  and  export  control  feasibility  and  compli-
ance in assessing the potential contributions of foreign partners.

ESA  proposes  to  contribute  significantly  to  the  JWST  mission.  On  JWST,  foreign
scientists  are  likely  to  receive  significant  amounts  of  science  (measured  in  terms  of
observing time on the telescope). Case in point is the Hubble Space Telescope, where
European  scientists  have  won  slightly  more  than  15  percent  of  the  total  observing
time  according  to  scientific  merit  through  the  competitive  time  allocation  process.
Therefore,  it  is  fair  and  logical  that  NASA  exact  tangible  contributions  to  JWST
from  foreign  space  agencies  in  proportion  to  the  amount  of  science  that  the  foreign
scientists they sponsor and represent are likely to receive. Hence, NASA seeks about
a 15 percent contribution from ESA.

Discussions  regarding  possible  ESA  contributions  have  explored  many  possibili-
ties. ESA proposes to contribute a near-infrared spectrometer (NIRSpec), an optical
bench  assembly  for  a  mid-infrared  instrument  (MIRI),  an  Ariane  5  ECA  launch  ve-
hicle  and  launch  services  with  a  launch  from  Kourou,  French  Guiana,  and  a  small
number  of  support  staff  in  residence  at  the  JWST  science  operations  and  control
center. The Ariane presents a small number of simple interfaces, and thus is an at-
tractive option from a technical viewpoint that reduces mission risk. It is also worth
substantial  value  by  itself  such  that  the  total  value  of  ESA’s  proposed  contribution
package is approximately 15 percent of the total mission cost.

Launch  of  any  U.S.  government  payload  on  a  foreign-supplied  launch  vehicle  is
subject  to  interagency  review,  in  accordance  with  NSPD  40,  National  Space  Trans-
portation  Policy,  dated  December  21,  2004.  This  interagency  review  has  been  com-
pleted,  clearing  the  way  for  what  is  known  as  the  C–175  process  by  which  the  De-
partment of State grants authority to NASA to negotiate with ESA the terms of co-
operation on JWST.

JWST  is  approaching  mission  preliminary  design  review  (PDR)  in  2006.  Many
subsystem  design  details  depend  on  knowing  the  launch  vehicle  envelope  and  envi-
ronment.  Therefore,  the  designation  of  the  launch  vehicle  for  JWST  is  needed  now
to preserve the launch schedule.
Q9. NASA  was  provided  $15  million  in  the  FY  2004  Appropriations  Act  for  crew
safety  and  survivability  by  Congressman  Hall.  Please  provide  a  report  on  how

this money was spent and how the results will improve safety and survivability
of human space flight.

A9. The Shuttle program reviewed a wide range of options for addressing crew sur-
vivability,  including  major  hardware  modification  of  the  vehicles.  The  evaluation
process  was  revised  in  light  of  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  which  calls  for
Shuttle retirement after assembly of the ISS is complete, planned for the end of this
decade.

Crew  survivability  options  encompass  a  range  of  means  that  could  be  imple-
mented  to  ensure  crew  safety  and  survivability  and  test  new  technologies  as  we
move  forward  with  the  Vision  for  Space.  The  Program  identified  a  series  of  options
that can be accomplished and are being pursued.

The  following  investment  areas  are  being  implemented.  Items  with  an  asterisk

(‘‘*’’) denote potential applicability to exploration initiatives.
Improved  Individual  Tracking  Device—will  significantly  increase  the  location
accuracy  and  acquisition  time  for  any  contingency  crew  rescue  operations  including
unconscious crew members. This effort is currently being reviewed and modified by
the Department of Defense (DOD) for completeness and accuracy.
* Portable  Radio  Communication  Device  with  GPS—will  enable  quick  identi-
fication  and  location  of  conscious  crew  members  during  rescue  operations.  This  de-
vice  will  transmit  crew  member  identification  and  location  data  to  multiple  DOD
Search and Rescue operation entities.
* Improve  ISS  Rendezvous  Radar—place  an  active  radar  transponder  on  ISS  to
aid in Orbiter dock/undock operations. This effort provides one clean, uninterrupted
sensor  source  for  all  phases  of  rendezvous.  Hardware  changes  would  be  on  the  ISS
side only. The current system becomes noisy due to radar wandering over the large
surface of ISS. A transponder on ISS would eliminate that noise, providing for pris-
tine  relative  navigation  data  for  the  manual  phase  and  docking,  thereby  increasing
the range at which the Orbiter could acquire a radar lock. It also improves naviga-
tion performance during the manual phase. A study of this proposal was completed
and has been incorporated into a larger autonomous rendezvous and docking effort.
Continuation  of  the  CAIB  Directed  Crew  Survivability  Working  Group—
performing  analysis  and  reconstruction  of  STS–107  post  break-up  crew  cabin  dy-
namics  and  forensics.  To  be  included  is  an  analysis/reconstruction  of  the  STS–51L
crew compartment dynamics and forensics. This actual flight reconstructed data will
be  utilized  by  flight  operations  in  future  procedure  development  and  possible  crew
compartment structural/thermal hardening for future vehicle design.
Egress Procedure Development—Develop crew operational procedures to support
crew  egress  in  the  event  of  a  catastrophic  vehicle  break-up  where  the  crew  cabin
has separated intact. Testing the new procedures entails changes to the program re-
quirements  documentation  and  facility  modifications  to  the  Crew  Compartment
Trainer  (CCT).  Activity  is  in  work  and  procedures  will  be  made  available  in  FY
2005.

Q10. In your testimony, you state that improved audit results ‘‘could be achieved on
the  FY  2006  financial  statements.’’  How  likely  is  that?  What  progress  toward
a  clean  audit  opinion  do  you  hope  to  make  this  year?  What  specific  actions  is
NASA  taking  to  ensure  that  its  financial  information  is  reliable  in  the  future?
Please  describe  the  actions  planned  for  the  next  six  months  and  any  longer-
term plans to improve the accuracy of financial information.

A10. NASA  has  developed  and  implemented  a  work  plan  aimed  at  correcting  the
material  weaknesses  and  reportable  conditions  published  in  the  FY  2004  Financial
Statement Audit report; however, it will take time to fully implement all of the iden-
tified corrective actions. Nevertheless, NASA is aiming at gradually and consistently
improving its audit performance, which includes a reduction in the number of iden-
tified  material  weaknesses  and  reportable  conditions.  Subsequently,  NASA’s  objec-
tive  is  to  receive  increasingly  positive  audit  results  in  each  of  the  following  years,
possibly starting with a ‘‘qualified’’ opinion and ultimately ending with a sustainable
‘‘unqualified’’ opinion.

The  objective  for  this  current  year  is  to  begin  the  reduction  of  material  weak-

nesses and reportable conditions.

One of our near-term goals is to eliminate the material weakness on the reconcili-

ation of Fund Balance with Treasury in the FY 2005 audit report.
Q11. Last year, NASA provided two different draft versions of a Financial Manage-
ment Improvement Plan to this committee. We understand that a third version
is  being  developed.  What  is  the  status  of  this  plan  and  when  do  you  expect  it
to be finished?

A11. NASA  is  in  the  process  of  coordinating  its  overall  plan  to  improve  financial
management with NASA’s Office of Inspector General and the Office of Management
and  Budget.  NASA  wants  each  of  those  offices  to  have  the  opportunity  to  review
and  comment  on  the  plan.  Once  all  of  their  suggested  comments  are  incorporated
into  the  revised  document,  NASA  will  deliver  the  financial  management  improve-
ment plan to the Committees later this year.
Q12. Has the budget for NASA’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) been reduced for FY
2005? If so, by how much was it reduced and what ramifications does this re-
duction have on NASA’s efforts to improve its financial management? Does the
FY 2006 budget increase or decrease the CFO’s budget request?

A12. Agency-wide  reductions  across  all  Corporate  G&A  activities  were  imposed  for
FY 2005 and FY 2006 to help accommodate costs associated with the Space Shuttle
Return-to-Flight  activities.  As  a  result,  the  staffing  plan  in  the  Office  of  Chief  Fi-
nancial  Officer  (OCFO)  and  the  Center’s  Financial  Offices  was  impacted.  Addition-
ally,  the  Agency’s  Integrated  Financial  Management  Program  was  reduced  by  37
percent or $41.5 million in FY 2005, and $7.8 million in FY 2006. This cut impacted
the  scope  and  schedule  of  the  Asset  Management  activity.  A  revised  scope  and
schedule reflecting the new funding profile is still in development.
Q13. What effect will NASA’s Earth Science cut in FY 2005 and its proposed cut for
FY 2006 have on the overall climate change research program? To what extent
did  the  other  agencies  involved  in  climate  change  research  participate  in  the
decisions  to  make  these  cuts?  What  criteria  did  you  use  to  determine  that  the
cuts  did  not  adversely  affect  anything  ‘‘essential’’?  Which  missions  does  NASA
plan  on  scaling  back,  delaying  or  canceling  as  part  of  this  reduction  in  fund-
ing? Are there any new Earth Science missions planned for the future that were
not already part of the FY 2005 budget submission?

A13. The  reductions  to  NASA’s  Earth  Science  programs  in  FY  2005  and  FY  2006
should not greatly affect the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP); NASA’s role
in research and the generation of synthesis reports (the principal near term product
of  the  CCSP)  will  continue  as  before.  NASA  engaged  the  other  CCSP  agencies  in
discussions  of  the  changes  to  NASA’s  budgets  as  they  were  being  developed.  The
principal  criterion  employed  was  to  do  the  least  harm  to  current  commitments  and
satellite  programs  currently  under  development.  In  the  FY  2005  budget,  the  Ocean
Vector Winds mission was canceled, and the Global Precipitation Measurement mis-
sion  was  delayed  two  years.  In  the  FY  2006  budget  request,  the  Glory  mission  is
re-scoped to instrument development only with an expectation that it will fly on the
NPOESS  system,  and  the  Landsat  Data  Continuity  Mission  now  reflects  the  provi-
sion  of  two-advanced  land  imaging  instruments  for  flight  on  the  NPOESS  system.
Funding  for  technology  development  and  future  mission  concepts  was  reduced.  No
new missions have been identified that were not part of the FY 2005 budget submis-
sion.  NASA  eagerly  awaits  the  decadal  survey  report  of  the  National  Research
Council,  as  well  as  recommendations  from  our  own  strategic  roadmapping  team  for
guidance on identification of potential future missions.
Q14. Your  FY  2006  budget  justification  (page  EC  2–6)  refers  to  NASA’s  ‘‘reassess-
ment  of  the  ISS  final  configuration.’’  Not  quite  a  month  ago  (January  26,
2005),  NASA  and  other  ISS  partners  announced  that  all  of  you  endorsed  the
‘‘Multilateral Coordination Board approved ISS configuration.’’ Is that the con-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00085 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

82

figuration  you  are  now  reassessing?  When  will  the  final  configuration  of  the
space  station  be  agreed  upon?  What  changes  to  that  configuration  are  being
considered  by  NASA?  In  particular,  are  you  reconsidering  whether  to  launch
the  centrifuge?  How  important  is  the  centrifuge  to  research  planned  by  NASA
and its partners?

A14. The International Partnership Heads of Agency (HOA) met January 26, 2005,
to review the status of ongoing ISS operations and NASA’s plans for Shuttle return-
to-flight. The HOA endorsed the Multilateral Coordination Board-approved ISS con-
figuration.  The  partners  reaffirmed  their  agencies’  commitment  to  meet  their  ISS
obligations;  to  complete  Station  assembly  by  the  end  of  the  decade;  and  to  use  and
further evolve the ISS in a manner that meets their research and exploration objec-
tives.

NASA is now examining configurations for the Space Station that meet the goals
of  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  and  the  needs  of  our  international  partners
using as few Shuttle flights as possible. The timeline for completion for these stud-
ies will be determined by the new NASA Administrator.

The Centrifuge remains on schedule for completion and delivery to Kennedy Space
Center  on  time  for  a  2009  launch.  NASA  requirements  for  the  Centrifuge  are  de-
rived  from  the  Human  Systems  Research  and  Technology  (HSR&T)  theme  within
the  Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate  (ESMD).  ESMD  recently  conducted  a
Zero-Based Review of the entire HSR&T portfolio in order to ensure that future ef-
forts will be focused on research that directly supports the future safety of the astro-
nauts.
Q15. Does  NASA  have  any  back-up  plan  for  providing  rescue  capability  for  the

Space Station if changes are not made to the Iran Nonproliferation Act?

A15. With  the  exception  of  the  Space  Shuttle,  the  Soyuz  is  the  only  other  proven
spacecraft  capable  of  performing  crew  transportation  and  rescue  operations  for  the
ISS.  If  the  Soyuz  were  to  become  unavailable  to  NASA,  the  operation  of  the  Space
Station would be limited to those periods of time when the Shuttle could be docked
to the ISS.
Q16. How confident are you of the accuracy of the proposed CEV budget for FY 2006,
which officials have described as a ‘‘placeholder’’? What is the range of possible
costs for the CEV in FY 2006?

A16. NASA’s  Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate,  in  partnership  with  indus-
try  through  the  Concept  Exploration  &  Refinement  (CE&R)  contracts,  has  been
evaluating  various  alternative  CEV  concepts  with  regard  to  safety,  sustainability,
cost, reliability, etc. The culmination of this evaluation process will be the Constella-
tion Mission Systems Spiral 1 Milestone–A Review. At this review, Exploration Sys-
tems  will  present  to  the  NASA  Program  Management  Council  a  range  of  cost  esti-
mates  for  CEV.  This  range  of  possible  costs  will  be  the  result  of  industry  inputs
through  the  CE&R  contracts  and  internal  NASA  studies,  validated  by  an  inde-
pendent cost assessment conducted by the NASA Cost Analysis Division with assist-
ance  from  the  Independent  Program  Assessment  Office.  Currently,  the  Spiral  1
Milestone–A Review is planned for July 2005.

In addition, Exploration Systems is in the process of procuring a minimum of two
contractors to complete preliminary design and perform a risk reduction demonstra-
tion  in  2008.  These  contracts  will  be  signed  in  September  2005.  At  this  time,  all
information and analyses indicate that Exploration Systems will be able to perform
preliminary  design  activities  and  initiate  development  of  risk  reduction  demonstra-
tions in FY 2006 within the proposed budget.
Q17. As Admiral Steidle has described, NASA is using an unusual procedure for the
CEV—going  out  with  initial  contracts  before  many  parameters  of  the  vehicle
are nailed down. What are the risks and advantages to that approach?

A17. The  capabilities  and  technologies  developed  to  extend,  in  an  affordable  and
sustainable  manner,  human  presence  beyond  low-Earth  orbit  to  the  Moon,  Mars,
and  beyond  will  require  NASA  to  respond  flexibly  to  new  scientific  discoveries  and
incorporate new technologies, while minimizing risk and avoiding costly redesign. In
order  for  ESMD  to  execute  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  effectively  and
affordably,  its  governing  acquisition  policies  draw  on  the  best  processes  from  the
DOD,  Naval  Sea  Systems  (NSS),  and  NASA  acquisition  models.  Additionally,
ESMD’s use of the evolutionary acquisition concept of spiral development allows this
flexibility.  In  spiral  development,  the  overall  program  is  broken  up  into  a  series  of
intermediate  goals,  each  addressed  by  a  spiral.  Because  it  is  not  realistic  to  define
all  variables  precisely  now,  NASA’s  plan  is  to  separate  the  acquisition  strategy  for

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

83

Moon  and  Mars  exploration  into  a  number  of  smaller  acquisition  programs  called
spirals.  Each  intermediate  spiral  will  usher  in  a  set  of  major  new  capabilities  in
support  of  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration.  These  spirals  will  be  structured  based
on  specific  requirements,  well-defined  goals  and  end  points,  then-current  tech-
nologies,  management  risks,  executable  budgets,  and  knowledge  gained  from  prior
in-space activities. The spiral development approach builds on experience gained in
early  spirals  to  provide  end  points  for  the  subsequent  spirals.  It  also  allows  flexi-
bility  in  responding  to  scientific  discoveries  and  program  direction  and  the  ability
to  incorporate  newly  developed  technologies  into  subsequent  spirals  through  a  pre-
planned integration strategy.

The  acquisition  strategy  for  a  Spiral  1  CEV  is  using  a  phased  approach.  The  cri-
teria  for  entering  the  next  phase  will  be  based  on  approval  of  the  CEV  Acquisition
Strategy  and  an  Independent  Cost  Assessment.  By  the  end  of  FY  2005,  NASA  ex-
pects to award two contracts for Phase I that will direct industry to:

• Conduct  a  flight  demonstration  program  to  validate  industry’s  capability  to
perform  on  cost,  on  schedule  and  on  performance.  Additionally,  the  dem-
onstration will be part of the overall CEV risk mitigation strategy.
• Evaluate NASA’s Exploration Systems Research and Technology, Human Sys-
tem  Research  and  Technology,  and  Prometheus  Nuclear  Systems  Technology
themes  for  potential  CEV  program  integration  as  part  of  a  concerted  effort
to improve system effectiveness and affordability.
• Conduct a series of trade analyses on critical performance drivers for the pur-
poses of identifying threshold and objectives for Phase 2 of the CEV contract.
Affordability,  sustainability,  and  extensibility  to  future  spirals  will  be  the
focus of the analyses.
• Participate in a NASA-led System Readiness Review and Preliminary Design
• Provide  an  iterative  analysis  of  cost,  risk  and  performance  based  on  realistic
• Provide  a  risk  management  plan,  which  will  mitigate  program  uncertainties
by  establishing  priorities,  options,  adequate  margins  of  safety,  and  ‘‘off-
ramps.’’

Review for the human-rated CEV.

timelines and estimates of cost.

CEV  Phase  1  actually  began  with  a  draft  Request  for  Proposals  (RFP)  released
in January 2005 seeking industry, academia and NASA Center inputs. A final RFP
was released March 1, 2005, with planned contract award in September 2005. CEV
Phase 1 ends with a planned down select to a single prime contractor in late 2008.
Phase 2 of the CEV acquisition calls for a single contractor to complete the develop-
ment, test, and deployment of a human-rated CEV. After completion of Phase 2, the
contractor shall provide as government options, sustaining engineering services and
production  capability  to  support  additional  flights  and  additional  CEV  spacecraft.
The government may elect to perform a down select at any time or not to select ei-
ther  contractor  after  2008.  ESMD  has  developed  a  Single  Acquisition  Management
Plan  documenting  ESMD’s  Overarching  Acquisition  Strategy  for  Constellation  Sys-
tems.

The  benefit  of  this  phased  approach  is  that  Milestone  A  activities,  specifically
trade studies in major areas affecting affordability, risk, schedule, and performance,
will  enable  ESMD  to  determine  more  achievable  requirements  for  the  next  Phase
of development. This approach also helps to anticipate and mitigate risk.
Q18. NASA’s  FY  2006  budget  basically  cancels  the  Glory  mission  while  allowing
work  to  continue  on  the  instrument.  Our  understanding,  though,  is  that  the
contract  for  the  satellite  will  actually  be  canceled  this  month.  Is  that  right?
How  likely  is  it  that  NASA  will  find  another  satellite  on  which  to  launch
Glory?

A18. In FY 2005, NASA is continuing development of the Aerosol Polarimetry Sen-
sor  (APS)  and  Total  Irradiance  Monitor  (TIM)  instruments  and  continuing  the  con-
tract  effort  to  refurbish  the  Vegetation  Canopy  Lidar  bus  as  a  dedicated  spacecraft
for  Glory.  NASA  is  currently  assessing  launch  options  for  both  dedicated  and  co-
manifested launch vehicle configurations.
Q19. If  the  Shuttle’s  failure  rate  in  the  past  (two  failures  in  113  flights)  is  taken  to
be the best estimate of its future rate of failure, a simple calculation shows that
the  probability  that  we  will  lose  another  Shuttle  in  28  flights  is  more  than  41
percent.  Does  this  seem  accurate  to  you?  What  is  NASA’s  estimate  of  the  prob-
ability  that  another  Shuttle  will  be  lost  over  the  next  28  flights?  Over  the  next
20 flights?

A19. Through implementation of NASA’s Return-to-Flight activities, the Agency has
made substantial organizational and technical improvements that we believe will re-
duce  the  failure  rate  of  the  Shuttle  below  the  historical  level.  This  includes  rede-
signs  to  address  the  cause  of  the  Columbia  accident  and  improvements  in  our
knowledge  of  the  state  of  the  vehicle  during  various  mission  phases.  We  have  also
improved our ability to address the inherent risk of human space flight with a thor-
ough  review  of  individual  and  integrated  risks.  However,  even  after  we  have  re-
turned the Shuttle to flight and examined the data from the initial missions, it will
still  be  difficult  to  estimate  the  actual  risk  that  a  given  future  mission  will  be  lost.
Q20. At the hearing, Mr. Jennings made the following statement regarding the budg-
et  and  the  number  of  employees  the  agency  projects  it  will  need.  ‘‘Going  into
’07,  we  are  budgeted  for  about  2,000  less  than  that  [18,000  employees],  and
over  the  next  two  years,  we  are  going  to  work  to  understand  our  exploration
program,  and  where  that  competition  lies,  and  our  assumption  is  we  will  re-
main  close  to  the  18,000  during  the—through  the  run-up.’’  Please  clarify  this
statement.  Specifically,  how  many  employees  does  the  agency  assume  for  each
year of the five-year budget projection?

A20. The  President’s  FY  2006  Budget  contains  only  workforce  currently  known  to
be  funded.  It  does  not  include  the  estimated  impact  of  future  Exploration  Systems
competitive decisions or of other Transformation or reimbursable activities that may
affect the size of the funded workforce. The FTE in the FY 2006 Budget are:

FY 2005: 19,227 (funded by programs and G&A)
FY 2006: 18,798 (funded by programs and G&A)
FY 2007: 16,738 (funded by programs)
FY 2008: 16,715 (funded by programs)
FY 2009: 16,586 (funded by programs)
FY 2010: 16,415 (funded by programs)

As  to  the  need  for  workforce  in  addition  to  that  currently  funded  by  programs,
we  can  only  estimate  the  results  of  the  ongoing  activities  that  will  define  such
needs.  These  include  competitions  for  major  elements  of  work  associated  with  the
Exploration  program  and  all  other  Transformation  activities  underway.  Within
those  bounds  of  uncertainty,  we  estimate  that  the  NASA  workforce  funded  by  pro-
grams  as  we  move  into  FY  2007  could  be  as  much  as  2,000  lower  than  it  is  today.
Beyond that point, as the Exploration program ramps up, and as Centers transform
themselves  to  facilitate  bringing  in  non-NASA  work  aligned  with  their  capabilities,
it is possible that the NASA workforce may grow back to where it is today or higher.
However,  the  skill  mix  and  distribution  of  that  workforce  will  almost  certainly  be
different.

There  is  still  a  significant  amount  of  FY  2007  programmatic  money  not  yet  as-
signed. This relatively high level of uncertainty was caused by major changes to the
workforce. Planning assumptions between the FY 2005 and FY 2006 budgets:

1. The Vision for Space Exploration
2. Requirements for the safe return-to-flight of the Space Shuttle
3. Reprioritization within the major program areas (Mission Directorates)
4. An  increased  emphasis  on  competition  to  identify  the  optimum  mix  of  civil

servants, contractors and university employees performing NASA work

5. An effort to maximize the resources available for direct mission objectives vs.

indirect support functions

There  are  ongoing  efforts  to  match  needed  skills  with  funded  work.  In  addition,
there will be billions of dollars of work available for competition as the Exploration
program  proceeds  with  its  overall  program  definition,  as  well  as  its  systems  engi-
neering and integration effort and Crew Exploration Vehicle activity. There will also
be  work  available  in  various  competitive  science  areas,  such  as  the  Discovery  and
Mars programs.

NASA’s ongoing health assessment of its core competencies may result in the ap-
plication  of  additional  program  resources  to  sustain  critical  workforce.  It  is  antici-
pated centers will pursue reimbursable work for non-NASA customers in their areas
of  special  competence.  Centers  may  also  consider  alternative  management  struc-
tures for more flexibility to pursue reimbursable tasks.

As  a  result  of  these  efforts,  many  of  the  FTEs  not  yet  supported  will  likely  be
matched  with  funded  requirements.  It  is  also  true  that  a  significant  number  may
not  be,  at  least  by  the  start  of  FY  2007.  The  best  we  can  do  is  to  offer  an  estimate
based  on  what  we  know  now  and  our  judgment  about  how  and  when  the  various

issues in the planning process will be resolved. We are working to reduce the uncer-
tainty as quickly as possible.

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. What  was  the  rationale  for  the  policy  decision  to  accept  a  multi-year  gap  after
the Shuttle is retired during which time the United States will have no currently
identified  U.S.  means  of  getting  its  astronauts  into  space  and  to  and  from  the
International Space Station?

Q1a. Was it budgetary?
Q1b. If not, what was the rationale?
A1a,b. It  is  important  to  note  that  the  President’s  Vision  for  Space  Exploration
called  for  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  to  be  ready  no  later  than  2014.  Adminis-
trator  Griffin  has  stated  his  determination  to  endeavor  to  have  the  Crew  Explo-
ration Vehicle ready earlier than 2014, thus reducing any potential ‘‘gap.’’

The  decision  to  not  guarantee  a  U.S.  means  of  getting  astronauts  into  space  im-
mediately  following  Space  Shuttle  retirement  was  informed  by  budgetary,  technical
and programmatic factors. These included:

• continuing concerns about Shuttle safety and the need to recertify the Shuttle

if it flew after 2010,

tion,

• assessments  of  how  long  the  Shuttle  was  needed  to  assemble  the  Space  Sta-

• the Space Shuttle’s $4 billion to $5 billion annual operating costs,
• the  cost  and  time  required  to  develop  a  new  U.S.  capability  to  launch  astro-
• the  disadvantages  of  having  no  guaranteed  alternative  U.S.  access  to  space

nauts, and

immediately following Shuttle retirement.

Q1c. What alternatives to a gap were considered, and why were they rejected?
A1c. Alternatives  were  assessed,  including  not  retiring  the  Shuttle,  retiring  the
Shuttle  immediately  without  returning  to  flight,  and  mandating  the  CEV  be  ready
by the time the Shuttle retired. These alternatives were rejected due to such factors
as  excessive  cost,  inability  to  meet  international  commitments,  and  technical  risk.
Q1d. If  during  the  multi-year  ‘‘gap’’  period,  the  Soyuz  spacecraft  becomes  unavail-
able  for  either  geopolitical  or  technical  reasons,  what  is  your  backup  plan  for
providing U.S. astronaut access to space/ISS?

A1d. Possible  alternatives  to  the  Soyuz  include  potential  commercially  developed
U.S.  services  that  NASA  has  procured  through  its  ISS  cargo  and  crew  program.
NASA  intends  to  issue  its  first  RFP  under  this  program  in  the  summer  of  2005.  If
the Soyuz were unavailable to NASA and no commercial services were available, the
operation  of  the  Space  Station  would  be  limited  to  those  periods  of  time  when  the
Shuttle could be docked to the ISS.
Q2. Given  the  existence  of  the  Iran  Nonproliferation  Act  as  public  law  since  2000,
what was the rationale for continuing to baseline the Russian Soyuz as the only
means  of  crew  rescue  for  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS)  for  the  duration
of the ISS program?

A2. Over  the  last  several  months,  NASA  has  been  participating  in  an  interagency
coordination process related to INA, which seeks to protect our nonproliferation ob-
jectives  while  advancing  potential  U.S.  cooperation  with  Russia  on  the  Vision  for
U.S. Space Exploration. The results of this interagency coordination process will be
presented to Congress shortly.

The  utilization  of  the  Soyuz  spacecraft  as  the  baseline  crew  rescue  vehicle  of  the
ISS  is  a  result  of  an  evolution  of  capabilities,  partner  commitments,  costs  chal-
lenges,  the  Columbia  tragedy  and  changes  in  national  priorities.  As  one  of  the  ISS
partners,  the  Russians  have  always  been  committed  to  providing  a  crew  rescue  ca-
pability  for  the  initial  years  of  ISS  operation.  The  Soyuz  is  a  tested,  reliable  and
available capability. We believe our resources are better spent utilizing a proven ca-
pability, rather than spending time and money to develop a new one.

In  order  to  facilitate  the  continued  use  of  the  Soyuz  crew  rescue  capability,  the
Addendum to the 1996 Balance Agreement, which covers necessary Russian services
through  2005,  was  negotiated  last  year  and  completed  interagency  concurrence  on
January  26,  2005.  The  agreement  covers  ‘‘habitation’’  through  December  2005  and

crew  rescue  through  April  2006.  Currently,  there  is  on-going  interagency  coordina-
tion on negotiation of a comprehensive re-balance. This coordination includes the de-
velopment  of  an  approach  that  would  allow  NASA  to  procure  certain  space  goods
and services from Roskosmos while maintaining a strong stance on nonproliferation
issues.
Q2a. What is your backup plan in case the Soyuz becomes unavailable?
A2a. The  Soyuz  spacecraft  and  Soyuz  rocket  booster  have  demonstrated  a  remark-
able  reliability  record  over  their  lifetime  of  operations.  With  the  exception  of  the
Space  Shuttle,  the  Soyuz  is  the  only  other  proven  spacecraft  capable  of  performing
crew  transportation  and  rescue  operations  for  the  ISS.  Possible  future  alternatives
to the Soyuz may include commercially developed U.S. services that NASA has pro-
cured through its ISS cargo and crew program. NASA intends to issue its first RFP
under  this  program  in  2005.  If  the  Soyuz  were  unavailable  to  NASA  and  no  com-
mercial services were available, the operation of the Space Station would be limited
to  those  periods  of  time  when  the  Shuttle  could  be  docked  to  the  ISS.  There  are
no plans for this mode of operation at this time.
Q3. What are the specific options under consideration by the interagency team exam-
ining alternatives for dealing with the Iran Nonproliferation Act’s impact on the
International Space Station?

A3. As the United States implements the Vision for U.S. Space Exploration, the Ad-
ministration recognizes the necessity for effective cooperation with Russia to further
our  space  exploration  goals.  At  the  same  time,  it  is  imperative  that  we  maintain
appropriate U.S. nonproliferation policy and objectives in our relationship with Rus-
sia.  Over  the  last  several  months,  NASA  has  been  participating  in  an  interagency
coordination process related to INA, which seeks to protect our nonproliferation ob-
jectives  while  advancing  potential  U.S.  cooperation  with  Russia  on  the  Vision  for
U.S. Space Exploration. The results of this interagency coordination process will be
presented to Congress shortly.
Q4. NASA  has  encouraged  contractors  bidding  on  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle
(CEV)  project  to  include  international  participants  on  their  industry  teams.
However,  it  appears  that  NASA  is  not  seeking  or  expecting  cost  sharing  by  the
governments of the non-U.S. companies. Instead, NASA apparently plans to pay
the non-U.S. companies with U.S. taxpayer dollars.

Q4a. Is that accurate—will American taxpayer dollars be used to pay non-U.S. com-

panies for their participation in the CEV project?

Q4b. If so, what is the rationale?
A4a,b. One  of  the  goals  of  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  is  to  promote  commer-
cial and international participation in exploration to further U.S. scientific, security,
and economic interests. Exploration Systems is committed to fulfilling the Vision in
an expeditious and cost-effective manner. The scope of international participation in
the Vision is still being defined. In the areas of advanced concepts and technologies,
Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate  (ESMD)  has  pursued  ways  of  procuring
foreign  capabilities  and  expertise  in  areas  where  domestic  sources  are  either
unobtainable  or  the  foreign  sources  reduce  risks  to  the  development  of  ESMD  sys-
tems.  As  such,  ESMD  has  been  open  to  teaming  arrangements  between  domestic
and  foreign  vendors  who,  by  linking  their  capabilities,  are  able  to  provide  a  better
product for the American taxpayer than separate efforts would otherwise yield.

Additionally,  ESMD  has  been  open  to  teaming  arrangements  between  U.S.  and
foreign  companies  on  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  (CEV)  Request  for  Proposal
where  U.S.  capabilities  are  optimized  by  the  foreign  capability.  NASA  has  not
sought  cost-sharing  arrangements  at  this  time  for  such  potential  teaming  arrange-
ments in order to ensure an even competitive environment for U.S. industry.

NASA  has  not  excluded  the  possibility  of  seeking  cost-sharing  arrangements  in
the future, so long as such arrangements do not introduce undo complications to the
industry-to-industry  relationship,  result  in  an  unfair  competitive  advantage  to  one
industry team, or place foreign government support on the critical path for the CEV.
Q5. When  John  Young,  the  highly  decorated  astronaut,  finally  retired  from  NASA
at the end of the year, he gave an interview on December 17th in which he was
asked  about  whether  NASA’s  safety  culture  had  changed  in  the  two  years  since
the Columbia accident. He said, ‘‘I was in the astronaut office the other day and
I  asked  them  how  many  people  thought  NASA  had  changed  its  culture  and  no-
body raised their hand. There were about a hundred people there, so that’s how
they feel now.’’

87

Q5a. That  is  a  very  troubling  assessment  from  people  inside  the  agency  who  are  in

a position to know. Would you care to comment?

A5a. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) report indicated that posi-
tive  change  to  the  NASA  safety  culture  would  be  difficult  to  accomplish.  Neverthe-
less,  in  the  year  and  a  half  since  the  CAIB  released  its  Final  Report,  NASA  has
significantly strengthened its safety organizations and culture. Following the CAIB’s
recommendations, we have established an Independent Technical Authority that op-
erates  as  the  warrant  holder  for  all  Space  Shuttle  waivers,  deviations,  and  excep-
tions  and  acts  as  an  independent  check  on  engineering  issues.  We  have  created  a
NASA  Engineering  and  Safety  Center  to  act  as  a  source  of  engineering  expertise
that  is  not  tied  to  any  one  particular  program  and  can  be  called  upon  to  provide
in-depth and independent analysis of complex technical issues. We have enlisted the
services  of  Behavioral  Science  Technology,  Inc.  (BST),  an  industry  leader  in  behav-
ior-based  performance  improvement,  to  identify  specific  cultural  and  communica-
tions issue throughout the Agency and help develop mitigation strategies to resolve
those issues. We are in the process of an Agency-wide organizational transformation
that has as one of its goals the elimination of communication barriers that can pose
risks to safety.

All  of  these  changes  are  designed  to  enhance  the  ability  of  individuals  to  voice
their  opinions  without  fear  of  retribution  or  marginalization.  The  results  of  recent
BST  cultural  surveys  across  NASA  suggest  that  we  have  made  some  significant
progress, in a very short period of time, in opening up communications between line
operators and managers. Such improvements will have a positive impact on NASA’s
overall  safety  culture.  The  job  is  never  done,  and  changes  to  culture  tend  to  take
a long period of time, but we feel that we have made a very positive start.
Q5b. How confident are you that the safety culture will be strong enough at the time
the  Shuttle  is  scheduled  to  return-to-flight?  On  what  do  you  base  that  conclu-
sion?

A5b. The ultimate strength of a safety culture is evidenced in the ability of individ-
uals  working  throughout  the  organization  to  elevate  concerns  to  the  appropriate
level of management and be confident that those concerns will be thoroughly vetted.
We believe that there is ample evidence of such a strong safety culture in the Space
Shuttle  program  supporting  Return-to-Flight.  For  example,  we  have  pushed  back
the Return-to-Flight date on several occasions so as to give ample time to fully meet
all  of  the  CAIB  recommendations  and  Space  Shuttle  program-initiated  activities.
The Space Shuttle program is sharing our lessons learned, issues, options and ulti-
mate decisions on how to proceed with implementation of Return-to-Flight activities
by  fully  documenting  them  in  the  Implementation  Plan  for  Space  Shuttle  Return-
to-Flight  and  Beyond,  which  is  now  in  its  ninth  revision.  A  key  aspect  of  preparing
for  the  upcoming  mission  has  been  a  series  of  simulations  where  the  Mission  Man-
agement  Team  is  presented  with  a  variety  of  problems  that  could  arise  during  a
mission,  and  must  investigate  the  problem  and  determine  how  to  proceed.  This  is
one example of opportunities for our Space Shuttle team to practice the types of be-
haviors  we  are  stressing  in  our  culture  change  activities,  including  understanding
and  assessing  minority  opinions.  The  Mission  Management  Team  simulations  have
included external observers who provide feedback to the team. The Return-to-Flight
Task  Group,  an  advisory  committee  co-chaired  by  Richard  Covey  and  Thomas  Staf-
ford,  provides  an  independent  check  on—and  an  unprecedented  level  of  external
scrutiny of—NASA’s implementation of the CAIB recommendations. There are mul-
tiple,  independent  avenues  for  safety  concerns  to  be  elevated  to  senior  program
managers,  and  all  of  those  avenues  have  been  fully  exercised  over  the  past  two
years. We are confident that our safety culture is significantly stronger than it once
was and that, while space flight can never be without risk, the safety culture is fully
ready to support the Shuttle’s return-to-flight.
Q6. NASA  has  canceled  funding  for  a  Hubble  servicing  mission  in  the  FY  2006

budget.

Q6a. What  will  happen  to  the  civil  servant  and  contractor  workforce  involved  with

Hubble servicing, and when?

A6a. The Administrator plans to review the possibility of conducting a Shuttle serv-
icing mission to the Hubble once the Shuttle has returned to flight. Any final deter-
mination  regarding  the  fate  of  the  civil  and  contractor  workforce  associated  with
Hubble servicing must await the conclusion of that review.

88

Q6b. If  Congress  or  a  new  NASA  Administrator  decides  to  reinstate  a  Shuttle  serv-
icing mission to Hubble, what civil service and contractor workforce will be re-
quired to complete the mission within the required timetable?

A6b. On  the  Hubble  program  side,  the  workforce  involved  with  ongoing  operations,
life extension, and de-orbit activity is essentially the same workforce that would be
required  to  support  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission.  Space  Shuttle  workforce  require-
ments are relatively insensitive to the mission.
Q6c. Does NASA have that workforce in place now?
A6c. Yes, NASA has that workforce in place now.
Q6d. What  additional  funding  would  be  required  in  FY05  and  FY06  to  cover  the

non-Shuttle-related costs of a Shuttle servicing mission to Hubble?

A6d. The Administrator plans to review the possibility of conducting a Shuttle serv-
icing mission to the Hubble once the Shuttle has returned to flight. Any final deter-
mination  regarding  funding  for  Hubble  servicing  must  await  the  conclusion  of  that
review.
Q7. Your  testimony  indicates  that  you  have  established  ‘‘core  competencies’’  at  each
of the NASA Centers that ‘‘must be maintained in order for the Agency’s mission
to  be  achieved.’’  You  also  say  that  these  competencies  will  be  funded  through
competition  for  work.  What  specifically  are  you  going  to  do  to  retain  the  core
competencies  in  a  particular  area  at  any  given  Center  over  those  periods  when
there is insufficient project funding to cover the workforce and facility costs?

A7. We  are  currently  engaged  in  a  process  to  assess  the  health  of  all  NASA  Core
Competencies,  a  process  that  will  be  repeated  on  an  annual  basis  in  conjunction
with the budget development. As part of this assessment, we may use peer reviews,
external  awards,  patents,  and  benchmarking  to  validate  that  NASA’s  core  com-
petencies  remain  competitive.  Our  core  competencies  sustainment  strategy  focuses
on  competition  as  the  preferred  approach  for  bringing  to  a  Center  the  necessary
level  of  work  to  sustain  a  core  competency.  However,  this  strategy  further  provides
for alternative sustainment approaches when, for example, a gap in competition op-
portunities puts a core competency at risk. The Centers will be responsible for iden-
tifying  where  they  are  unable  to  sustain  the  critical  level  from  the  resources  avail-
able to them. Mission Directorates will then be responsible for providing needed re-
sources  through  direct  work  assignments  to  the  Center  if  necessary.  If  that  is  not
feasible,  the  Mission  Directorates  are  then  responsible  for  bringing  the  issue  for-
ward  to  the  Agency  leadership  where  a  tailored  investment  strategy  will  be  devel-
oped.
Q8. Please  provide  both  the  actual  civil  service  and  the  actual  contractor  workforce
levels  broken  down  by  Center  (including  HQ)  for  the  years  FY  2004  and  2005,
and also the projected civil service and contractor workforce levels broken down
by  Center  (including  HQ)  that  are  assumed  in  the  FY  2006  budget  request  for
each of the years FY 2006 through FY 2010.

Q8a. How  many  of  the  current  civil  service  employees  does  the  FY  2006  budget  re-

quest assume will no longer work at NASA by FY 2007?

A8a. The chart below shows the NASA workforce requirements as identified by the
existing  Agency  programs.  These  numbers  do  not  reflect  additional  workforce  that
will  be  required  as  Centers  are  awarded  additional  projects  currently  identified  in
the  budget  for  future  competitions.  As  shown  in  the  chart,  NASA’s  budgeted  work-
force decreases by 2060 FTE from FY 2006 to FY 2007 as part of the transformation
of  the  agency  to  fulfill  the  new  Vision.  There  are  ongoing  efforts  to  match  needed
skills  with  funded  work  both  at  the  Centers  currently  showing  reductions  and  at
other  Centers  that  continue  to  hire.  There  is  still  a  significant  amount  of  FY  2007
programmatic money not yet assigned. There will be work available for competition
as the Exploration program proceeds with its overall program definition, as well as
its  systems  engineering  and  integration  effort  and  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  activ-
ity.  There  will  be  work  available  in  various  competitive  science  areas,  such  as  the
Discovery  and  Mars  programs.  NASA’s  ongoing  health  assessment  of  its  core  com-
petencies  may  result  in  the  application  of  additional  program  resources  to  sustain
critical workforce. It is also anticipated that Centers will pursue reimbursable work
for  non-NASA  customers  in  their  areas  of  special  competence.  Because  of  these  on-
going  activities,  FTEs  currently  not  supported  may  yet  be  matched  with  funded  re-
quirements.

NASA’s  performance  based  procurements  are  not  managed  or  budgeted  by  con-
tractor  head  count,  so  accurate  projections  of  the  contractor  workforce  are  not  pos-
sible.

Q9. Please  provide  a  breakdown  by  specialty  and  by  Center  of  the  number  of  civil
servants  that  have  been  identified  as  ‘‘excess  competencies.’’  What  were  the  cri-
teria used to determine who falls into the ‘‘excess competency’’ category?

A9. NASA  has  identified  those  positions  that  do  not  support  a  funded  program  or
project  and,  therefore,  must  be  funded  through  Center  overhead  funds.  These  are
referred  to  as  ‘‘unfunded  capacity.’’  Some  of  these  ‘‘unfunded  capacity’’  positions  in-
clude  competencies  that  we  know  will  not  be  needed  in  their  current  quantity  to
support the Agency’s new Vision and those are the competencies that are currently
part of our buyout activities.

NASA will maintain the workforce necessary to assure the health of the core com-
petencies  the  Mission  Directorates  rely  on.  We  are  currently  engaged  in  a  process
to assess the health of all NASA’s core competencies, a process that will be repeated
on an annual basis in conjunction with budget development. Our core competencies
sustainment  strategy  focuses  on  competition  as  the  preferred  approach  for  bringing
to a Center the necessary level of work to sustain a core competency. However, this
strategy further provides for alternative sustainment approaches when, for example,
a gap in competition opportunities puts a core competency at risk. The Centers will
be  responsible  for  identifying  where  they  are  unable  to  sustain  the  critical  level
from  the  resources  available  to  them.  Mission  Directorates  will  be  responsible  for
providing  needed  resources,  or  if  that  is  not  feasible,  bringing  the  issue  forward  to
the Agency leadership where a tailored investment strategy will be developed.

It  is  anticipated  that  Centers  will  pursue  reimbursable  work  for  non-NASA  cus-
tomers  in  their  areas  of  special  competence.  Centers  may  also  consider  alternative
management structures for more flexibility to pursue reimbursable tasks. Once this
analysis  is  completed,  NASA  will  be  in  a  position  to  more  precisely  identify  its  ex-
cess workforce competencies.
Q10. Administrator  O’Keefe  testified  to  our  Committee  in  February  of  2004  that
NASA  would  know  whether  development  of  a  new  heavy-lift  rocket  would  be
necessary  to  fulfill  exploration  mission  requirements  ‘‘within  this  next  six
months to a year.’’ A year has now passed, and NASA has still not said wheth-
er it will need to develop a heavy-lift vehicle.

Q10a. Why  did  NASA  miss  the  milestone  stated  by  the  Administrator  for  reaching

a decision?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00093 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

90

A10a. Because the question of heavy lift is so central to the overall execution of the
Vision for Space Exploration, NASA has moved very carefully to ensure that all po-
tential technical, budgetary, and policy issues are fully considered and vetted. Since
Administrator O’Keefe testified before the Committee in February, 2004, there have
been a number of significant developments, including the release of the Final Report
of  the  President’s  Commission  on  Implementation  of  United  States  Space  Explo-
ration Policy, the release of a new U.S. Space Transportation Policy, and the devel-
opment of an Agency-wide strategic roadmapping process. All of these developments
must  be  carefully  considered  by  NASA  in  the  decision  process  on  the  need  for  a
heavy-lift vehicle.

NASA has made significant progress in coming to an informed decision on the po-
tential  role  of  heavy  lift  within  a  mixed  launch  vehicle  fleet.  Among  the  issues  and
trades that NASA is considering are the technologies from which a heavy lift vehicle
might evolve (Shuttle, expendable launch vehicle, or hybrid), the needs of the Inter-
national  Space  Station  in  the  post-Shuttle  environment,  potential  synergy  between
the  needs  of  the  ISS  and  future  exploration  requirements,  and  overall  cost  and
schedule  impacts.  Assessments  and  recommendations  from  this  ongoing  evaluation
are  also  being  coordinated  with  other  Federal  Government  partners,  including  the
Department of Defense, as directed by the new transportation policy.
Q10b. When will NASA know?
A10b. We  expect  to  have  initial  results  from  our  roadmapping  activity  complete  in
May of this year.
Q10c. What are the specific criteria that will be used in making the decision?
A10c. The  criteria  in  making  the  decision  of  whether  to  pursue,  and  if  so  how  best
to  pursue,  an  evolved  heavy  lift  option  will  include  overall  best  value  to  NASA
across all present and future missions, total life cycle costs, the availability of tech-
nology options and the cost/risk associated with these options (including the unique
consideration of human rated/high value payloads), and the potential availability of
an evolved heavy lift option against our need date.
Q10d. Is  there  funding  reserved  for  such  a  launch  vehicle  in  the  five-year  runout  of

the FY06 budget and if so, how much and in what account?

A10d. No,  although  long-range  budget  planning  for  Constellation  systems  does  in-
clude  some  provisions  for  a  heavy  lift  option.  However,  these  plans  do  not  include
heavy lift funding as a separate line item in the current five-year runout.
Q11. In 2001, NASA and the Department of Defense entered into a collaborative Na-
tional  Aerospace  Initiative  (NAI).  Hypersonics  research  to  enable  both  near-
term  and  longer-term  advances  in  air-breathing  hypersonics  vehicles  was  con-
sidered to be an essential element of that Initiative. However, NASA’s FY 2006
budget  request  contains  no  funding  for  hypersonics  research.  What  is  the  rea-
son for not providing funding—is it budgetary or is there a policy rationale for
the elimination of the funding? If the latter, what is that rationale?

A11. Through  a  Congressional  special  interest  item,  NASA  is  currently  funded  to
work  on  the  X–43C  concept  in  FY  2005.  At  present,  there  is  no  plan  to  continue
funding hypersonics beyond the present year. In FY 2006 and the near-term, NASA
will  refocus  its  resources  for  the  Vehicle  Systems  Program  on  a  limited  number  of
demonstrations.  The  current  four  programmatic  priorities  are  supersonic  low-boom
demonstration, a demonstration of a zero-emissions vehicle, a demonstration of high
altitude  long-endurance  aircraft,  and  a  demonstration  of  integrated  subsonic  noise
reduction.  Hypersonics  demonstrations  may  re-emerge  as  a  high  priority  in  the  out
years.
Q12. When  the  White  House  directed  NASA  to  cut  its  four-year  budget  plan  (FY
2006–09) by $2.5 billion relative to the budget plan that accompanied the FY05
NASA  budget  request,  the  aeronautics  program  had  to  absorb  almost  a  third
of that total cut.

Q12a. What  was  the  rationale  for  allocating  that  fraction  of  the  cut  to  aeronautics?
Q12b. Who proposed that allocation of the cut—NASA or OMB?
A12a,b. NASA  budget  formulation  was  guided  by  the  Exploration  Vision  and  other
national  priorities.  Accordingly,  resource  decisions  resulted  in  reductions  between
the  FY  2005  and  FY  2006  budget  requests,  which  required  all  Directorates  to  con-
tribute to deficit reduction. Throughout this process, NASA priorities and key mile-
stones were retained.

NASA  is  transforming  its  Aeronautics  program  in  the  FY  2006  Budget  request.
NASA is simultaneously transforming its Aeronautics Research investment to more
sharply  focus  on  revolutionary,  high-risk,  ‘‘barrier  breaking’’  technologies.  Toward
this end, the NASA Aeronautics Vehicle Systems Program (VSP) has been refocused
away  from  evolutionary  research  and  technology  development  of  the  past  and  to-
ward more revolutionary, ‘‘barrier-breaking’’ technology demonstration projects that
address critical public needs related to reduction of aircraft noise and emissions, and
enable  new  science  missions.  The  revolutionary  technologies  developed  by  NASA
within the next decade will form the basis for a new generation of environmentally
friendly  aircraft  and  will  enhance  U.S.  competitiveness  20  years  from  now.  This
budget supports NASA’s emphasis to address basic aeronautical barriers confronting
our  national  aviation  system  and  supports  research  to  pioneer  and  validate  high-
value technologies that enable new exploration and discovery, and improve the qual-
ity  of  life  though  practical  applications.  The  President’s  FY  2006  Budget  fully  sup-
ports  the  Aeronautics  program’s  vital  research  in  Aviation  Safety  and  Security  and
Airspace Systems.
Q13. Although  the  NASA  Administrator,  among  others,  had  showcased  the  Jupiter
Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) mission as the first flight demonstration of the explo-
ration  initiative’s  Project  Prometheus  nuclear  technology  program,  NASA  has
now  indefinitely  deferred  the  JIMO  mission  due  to  ‘‘concerns  over  costs  and
technical complexity.. . .’’ What were the specific cost and technical issues, and
when did they emerge?

A13. During  the  course  of  conceptual  design  and  trade  studies,  it  was  determined
that the mission requirements directly related to JIMO (such as mission lifetime to
reach  Jupiter)  were  too  complex  for  a  first  mission  to  use  space  nuclear  electric
power and propulsion. These nuclear electric power and propulsion technologies will
include a new capability to enter into orbit around multiple moons of the outer plan-
ets for long duration exploration and reconnaissance. Electric propulsion technology
developed and flown in the past, and terrestrial nuclear power system development
efforts both provide firm foundations upon which to build; but in both cases a flight
system  would  require  substantial  technology  maturation  including  life  testing.  Al-
though  NASA  never  prepared  a  formal  cost  estimate,  a  CBO  estimate  prepared  in
September 2004 indicated a cost of roughly $10 billion.

In  addition,  the  JIMO  mission  concept  was  developed  before  the  announcement
of the President’s Vision for Space Exploration. As a result of NASA’s new direction,
the  needs  for  and  uses  of  nuclear  power  and  propulsion  have  to  be  reassessed.
NASA  is  currently  reviewing  an  Analysis  of  Alternatives  as  well  as  undertaking  a
strategic  roadmapping  process  to  better  integrate  nuclear  technology  development
with  the  Vision  and  determine  a  more  suitable  and  affordable,  first  flight  dem-
onstration mission.

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. Please  provide  the  risk  assessment  of  the  SM–4  Shuttle  servicing  mission  that
was  prepared  for  Administrator  O’Keefe,  as  well  as  any  other  safety  analyses
used by the Administrator in making his determination to cancel the SM–4 serv-
icing mission.

A1. Attached  is  a  letter  provided  to  Chairman  Sherwood  Boehlert  on  March  14,
2005, that responds to your question. [See p. 71.]

The  decision  not  to  pursue  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission  to  the  Hubble  was  based
on  a  relative  risk  analysis  and  operational  complexity.  The  National  Academy  of
Sciences  (NAS)  report  recommended  a  Shuttle-based  servicing  mission  for  Hubble,
and concluded that a Shuttle flight to Hubble was not significantly more risky than
a  Shuttle  flight  to  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS).  Yet  while  all  space  flight
is inherently risky, there are both on-orbit and ground processing requirements that
would  be  notably  unique  to  a  Hubble  servicing  mission.  While  similar  issues  (ther-
mal protection system inspection and repair, contingency Shuttle crew support, and
potentially rescue) exist for missions to the ISS, they can be mitigated more easily,
in part due to the increased time available for understanding and responding to an
emergency situation at the Station. For a Hubble servicing mission, the options and
available  time  for  dealing  with  an  on-orbit  emergency  are  greatly  reduced,  posing
additional risk to the mission.

NASA has developed a five-point flight rationale (addressing safety requirements)
for Space Shuttle RTF, which is grounded in the recommendations of the CAIB and
predicated  on  primary  hazard  control,  warning  devices  and  special  procedures.  The
first two elements of that flight rationale (Elimination of Critical Debris and Impact

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00095 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

92

Detection During Ascent) rely upon Space Shuttle hardware, infrastructure, and pro-
cedural improvements that broadly apply to all missions, including those to destina-
tions  other  than  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS).  However,  the  efforts  of  the
Space  Shuttle  program  to  meet  the  three  remaining  elements  of  the  RTF  flight  ra-
tionale  (On-Orbit  Debris  Impact/Damage  Detection;  On-Orbit  Thermal  Protection
System Repair; and, Crew Rescue) assume access to the resources of the ISS. Devel-
oping the additional capabilities necessary to meet these three elements of the flight
rationale for a Hubble servicing mission would entail additional risks above and be-
yond those inherent in a mission to the ISS.

The  ISS  provides  Space  Shuttle  managers  with  three  critical  capabilities  not
found  in  autonomous  missions.  First,  the  ISS  serves  as  an  independent  observing
platform  for  assessing  the  integrity  of  the  Space  Shuttle’s  Thermal  Protection  Sys-
tem  (TPS).  Second,  the  ISS  can  operate  as  an  independent  working  platform  from
which Space Shuttle crews can conduct repairs to the TPS if necessary. Finally, the
ISS provides redundancy as a safe haven platform capable of sustaining a stranded
Space  Shuttle  crew  for  a  significantly  longer  period  of  time  than  the  Shuttle  alone
can.

To  apply  this  same  flight  rationale  to  a  Hubble  servicing  mission,  NASA  would
have  to  develop  new  capabilities  that  are  analogous  to  those  provided  by  the  ISS.
The Orbiter Boom Sensor System would have to be extensively modified, or an alter-
native capability would need to be created. Specifically, there would have to be new
hardware  and  procedures  to  provide  space-walking  astronauts  a  platform  from
which  to  effect  repairs  to  a  damaged  TIPS,  without  increasing  the  risk  of  further
damaging  the  Orbiter.  Additionally,  a  way  would  need  to  be  found  to  sustain  the
crew  of  a  hopelessly  crippled  Orbiter  with  limited  life-support  capabilities  long
enough  for  a  second  Shuttle  to  be  launched  on  a  rescue  mission.  That  rescue  mis-
sion, in turn, would need to be processed at the same time as the Hubble servicing
mission itself, a situation which would be highly complex, would require double the
normal workload on ground launch and processing teams, and would put an unprec-
edented  strain  on  the  overall  Shuttle  system.  Finally,  a  rescue  mission  would  re-
quire  many  unproven  techniques,  such  as  emergency  free-space  crew  transfer  in
space suits while performing Space Shuttle to Space Shuttle station-keeping. Being
based at the ISS offers the advantages of multiple hatches, airlocks, and established
docking  and  evacuation  procedures,  which  would  afford  a  shirt-sleeve,  nominal
transfer of crew from the ISS to the rescue Orbiter.

New  capabilities  would  need  to  be  built,  tested,  and  validated  before  Hubble  had
degraded to the point where any reasonable repair effort would be impossible. Seek-
ing  to  develop  and  validate  these  new  capabilities  in  time  for  Hubble  servicing,  as
well as process a second launch, is contrary to the milestone-driven approach NASA
has adopted in response to the CAIB recommendations.

Based on analysis of the relative risks, operational complexity and implicit sched-
ule  pressure,  in  February  2004,  NASA  decided  not  to  proceed  with  a  Shuttle  serv-
icing  mission  of  Hubble.  The  new  NASA  Administrator  has  stated  his  intention  to
revisit  this  earlier  decision  in  light  of  what  NASA  learns  after  the  Shuttle  returns
to flight.
Q2. Please  provide  NASA’s  cost  estimate  for  the  SM– 4  Shuttle  servicing  mission  to
Hubble,  including  a  breakdown  of  it  by  cost  category  and  the  specific  assump-
tions included in the cost estimate.

A2. NASA estimates the cost of $1.7 billion–$2.4 billion for SM– 4 —a Space Shuttle
servicing  mission  to  Hubble.  This  estimate  was  provided  to  Aerospace  Corporation
to  assist  them  in  their  development  of  an  Analysis  of  Alternatives  (AOA)  for  the
Hubble Space Telescope. For Space Shuttle missions, the general assumption of five
years  of  operations  was  made.  The  AOA  report  provided  by  Aerospace  Corporation
adjusted  that  estimate  slightly  by  reducing  two  years  of  operations  for  the  SM– 4
mission.  Aerospace  made  this  adjustment  based  on  their  own  assessments  of  oper-
ations  costs,  therefore  reducing  the  Space  Shuttle  numbers  by  two  years  of  oper-
ations (worth about $200 million) in order to provide a baseline for comparison. The
estimates  provided  are  considered  preliminary  only.  Additional  assumptions  in-
cluded three years of Hubble operations after servicing is completed.

These costs assume completion of required Return-To-Flight (RTF) actions for the
Space Shuttle fleet and missions to ISS, but RTF costs are not included in the $2.4
billion estimate.

The $2.4 billion includes a small portion of the cost to cover the de-orbit.

Q3a. NASA  has  not  committed  to  providing  a  ‘‘safe  haven’’  capability  for  the  Space
Shuttle  at  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS)  beyond  the  first  two  Shuttle
flights  after  Return-to-Flight.  Does  NASA  intend  to  baseline  such  a  require-
ment  for  the  duration  of  the  ISS  assembly  phase  (running  through  2010)?  If
not, why not?

A3a. NASA has not specifically ruled out the requirement to have a safe haven ca-
pability for an extended period. We are using safe haven as a last resort in the un-
likely  event  that  return-to-flight  modifications  are  in  error  and  there  is  a  need  to
safely bring the crew home on another vehicle or vehicles.
Q3b. What  specifically  would  be  required  to  enable  a  ‘‘safe  haven’’  on  the  ISS  for  a
combined crew of 9–13 Shuttle/ISS astronauts for 30–90 days for the duration
of the Space Station assembly phase? What changes to NASA’s current ISS as-
sembly and operations plans would be required?

A3b. By  far,  the  greatest  issue  with  maintaining  a  safe  haven  capability  through
2010 is the adverse impact it would have on logistics needs and the upmass impact
to the ISS to maintain the capability to support the larger crew. The Space Shuttle
and  International  Space  Station  programs  are  currently  assessing  the  logistics  re-
quirements needed to support the safe haven capability beyond the first two Return-
to-Flight missions.
Q3c. If  NASA  decides  not  to  baseline  a  ‘‘safe  haven’’  capability  on  the  ISS  for  the
duration  of  the  ISS  assembly  phase,  will  NASA  baseline  a  requirement  for  a
backup Shuttle on the launch pad for all remaining ISS assembly flights?

A3c. The  current  safe  haven  approach  does  not  require  a  backup  Shuttle  to  be  on
the launch pad at the time of launch. For STS–114, the launch-on-need vehicle will
not  have  rolled  out  of  the  Orbiter  Processing  Facility,  given  that  we  launch  at  the
opening of the window on May 15, 2005. The requirement is to have a backup Shut-
tle  in  position  to  launch  in  sufficient  time  to  meet  the  defined  safe  haven  support
window  that  the  ISS  offers  the  combined  Shuttle/ISS  crew.  The  requirement  and
timetable  for  the  launch-on-need  vehicle  in  support  of  STS–121  is  similar  to  that
for  STS–114.  The  Space  Shuttle  program  is  currently  assessing  the  launch-on-need
requirement for missions after STS–121.
Q4. NASA  is  significantly  reducing  its  participation  in  a  number  of  national  inter-
agency  R&D  initiatives  in  its  FY06  budget  request,  most  notably  the
Nanotechnology,  Networking  and  Information  Technology,  and  Climate  Change
Science  initiatives.  What  are  the  specific  reasons  for  each  of  the  funding  reduc-
tions?

A4. To  pursue  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  in  FY  2006,  NASA  must  assemble
a  much  broader  portfolio  of  research  than  in  past  years.  Nanotechnology  and  Na-
tional Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) were previously
primary focus areas. NASA’s transformation to the Vision has a much more focused
research agenda than in previous years. At the same time, the funding available to
support  this  broader  research  portfolio  remains  roughly  unchanged.  As  a  result,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00097 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

94

fewer projects in Nanotechnology and NITRD are competitively selected than in pre-
vious years.

In  2006,  NASA’s  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  and  mission  needs  for  Return-to-
Flight  will  affect  its  participation  in  the  National  Information  Technology  Research
and  Development  (NITRD)  Program.  NASA  will  continue  operating  the  52-teraflop
Columbia  computer  acquired  in  2004  and  2005  for  science  and  engineering  simula-
tion, including providing access to this world-class resource for the scientific commu-
nity.  Funding  for  Grand  Challenge  Applications  will  be  reduced,  and  High-End
Computing (HEC) technology research will be completed, reducing its HEC I&A (In-
frastructure  and  Applications)  participation  and  ending  NASA’s  HEC  R&D  partici-
pation.  NASA  will  continue  interagency  coordination  activities  in  architectures,
testbeds,  and  system  performance  assessment.  Funding  for  research  in  intelligent
systems  and  grid  computing  has  been  redirected  to  more  directly  address  time-crit-
ical  agency  mission  needs  related  to  Return-to-Flight  and  the  Vision  for  Space  Ex-
ploration, reducing NASA participation in Human Computer Interface and Informa-
tion  Management  (HCI&IM)  and  Large  Scale  Networking  [including  Next  Genera-
tion Internet] (LSN). NASA investments in autonomous systems and robotics are no
longer counted as part of Software Design and Productivity (SDP), and NASA fund-
ing similarly is no longer counted as part of Social, Economic, and Workforce Impli-
cations of IT (SEW). As a result of these reductions and redirections, NASA overall
funding  for  NITRD  activities  changes  from  $162.9  million  in  FY  2005  to  $74.3  mil-
lion in FY 2006.

NASA  continues  its  contribution  of  over  $1  billion  annually  to  improving  our  un-
derstanding  of  our  Earth’s  climate.  NASA’s  constellation  of  over  28  Earth-Sun  ob-
serving  satellites  provides  a  host  of  on-going  data  sources  to  improve  our  under-
standing  of  Earth’s  climate.  NASA  is  helping  to  protect  this  scientific  resource  by
providing funding for extended operations of many satellites beyond their initial de-
sign life. Additional funding is provided in FY 2006 to complete several key missions
in  development,  including  Calipso,  Cloudsat,  NPOESS  Preparatory  Project  (NPP),
and  Ocean  Surface  Topography  Mission  (OSTM).  Additional  missions  in  the  formu-
lation stage, if they are approved to proceed to development, will provide new ways
to  assess  the  Earth’s  climate.  The  percent  reduction  in  CCSP  elements  of  the  FY
2006  budget  reflects  a  decrease  in  mission  operations  funding  due  to  several  mis-
sions  reaching  the  end  of  their  operational  life  and  decreased  ground  network  ex-
penditures, along with a planned ramp-down in spending on NPP, which is nearing
launch.  The  FY06  request  also  assumes  the  Glory  mission  will  be  an  instrument-
only build.

NASA  continues  to  make  a  strong  investment  in  nanotechnology,  and  will  invite
proposals for nanotechnology development in future responses to Broad Agency An-
nouncements.  In  addition,  NASA  has  had  discussions  with  the  National  Science
Foundation  concerning  strategic  partnership  in  various  areas  of  research  and  tech-
nology, including nanotechnology.
Q5. Jupiter’s  moon  Europa  ranked  very  high  on  the  National  Academies’  solar  sys-
tem  decadal  survey  priority  list.  Since  the  FY06  budget  effectively  cancels—‘‘in-
definitely defers’’ to use OMB’s language—the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO)
project,

Q5a. Are  there  any  plans  for  an  alternative  mission  to  Europa  within  the  next  dec-

ade?

Q5b. If so, where will the funding for it come from?
A5a,b. NASA  is  studying  alternative  ways  to  get  to  Europa.  In  addition,  we  have
opened  a  dialogue  with  our  international  partners,  particularly  the  Europeans,  re-
garding  this  issue.  No  funding  source  has  yet  been  identified  for  such  alternatives.
Q6. NASA  has  for  years  touted  the  Space  Station’s  research  program  as  benefiting
the  health  and  welfare  of  citizens  back  here  on  Earth.  Now  as  part  of  the  re-
structuring  of  the  ISS  research  program,  NASA  has  indicated  that  it  will  only
focus  on  exploration-related  R&D  and  will  largely  abandon  any  research  di-
rected at terrestrial applications.

Q6a. What  is  the  reason  for  eliminating  essentially  all  non-exploration-related  re-
search  on  the  Station?  Why  can’t  it  co-exist  with  the  exploration-related  re-
search program?

A6a. NASA is in the process of realigning its research initiatives in order to support
the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration.  Efforts  will  be  focused  on  research  that  directly
supports  the  future  safety  and  effectiveness  of  Expedition  crews.  NASA’s  efforts  in
the  biomedical  area  are  focused  on  research  that  will  result  in  a  significant  reduc-

tion  of  risk  to  exploration  crews.  A  curtailment  of  alternate  research  within  our
portfolio is necessary due to space-based resource limitations.

The  Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate  (ESMD)  recently  conducted  a  Zero
Base  Review  of  the  entire  Human  Systems  Research  and  Technology  (HSRT)  port-
folio which consists of the programs and projects of the former Biological and Phys-
ical Research Enterprise. This review has identified the following research priorities
for  successful  implementation  of  the  Vision:  space  radiation  health  and  shielding,
advanced  environment  control  and  monitoring,  advanced  EVA,  human  health  and
countermeasures, advanced life support, exploration medical care, and space human
factors and behavioral health. One of the conclusions reached during the Zero-Base
Review suggested that NASA’s research programs should prioritize medical research
on human subjects over basic animal, cell, and tissue models. The redirection of the
program  in  this  way  was  based  on  an  internal  programmatic  review  and  assess-
ment, input from NASA’s Medical Policy Board Subcommittee on the Centrifuge Ac-
commodation  Module  and  Centrifuge,  and  recommendations  from  the  National
Academies/Space  Studies  Board  (NA/SSB)  report:  ‘‘Assessment  of  the  Directions  in
Microgravity and Physical Sciences Research at NASA.’’

The  HSRT  Zero  Base  Review  has  been  completed  and  results  are  being  reviewed

and integrated.

Concurrent  to  the  Zero  Base  Review  activity,  NASA  is  conducting  an  ISS  utiliza-
tion  effort  to  identify  the  best  means  by  which  to  use  the  unique  ISS  platform.
Based on the results of the Strategy-to-Task-to-Technology (STT) prioritization proc-
ess currently in work, such utilization opportunities may include flight experiments
to test and validate technologies like in-space assembly, cryo fluid management, ad-
vanced  propulsion,  and  space  power  systems.  NASA  is  also  investigating  how  effi-
ciencies can be gained in the area of payload planning, integration of research hard-
ware  into  the  launch  vehicle  and  the  ISS,  crew  training,  and  real-time  operations
support.

Additionally,  NASA  continues  to  expand  its  contribution  to  Earth  applications  of
our  research  technology  development  investments  through  the  Innovative  Partner-
ships  Program  (IPP).  IPP  is  taking  deliberate  actions  to  improve  the  quality  of  life
on  Earth  from  these  investments,  through  its  current  projects,  technology  transfer,
Small  Business  Innovative  Research  (SBIR),  Small  Business  Technology  Transfer
(STTR), Industry-led partnerships and University-Led partnerships, all fostering the
creation of benefits throughout all NASA research and technology development pro-
grams.  University-led  partnerships  include  the  Research  Partnerships  Centers
(RPCs),  an  established  network  of  dual-use  research  centers  located  at  universities
around  the  U.S.,  and  the  University  Research  Engineering  Technology  Institutes
(URETI),  a  consortia  of  universities  pursuing  basic  research  in  nano-technology.
Highly  leveraged  partnerships  such  as  the  RPCs  make  it  possible  to  meet  NASA’s
exploration  needs  while  at  the  same  time  fostering  the  creation  and  delivery  of
Earth benefits through the industrial partners. The leveraging of these partnerships
helps  to  make  the  exploration  vision  affordable,  while  the  benefits  help  to  make  it
sustainable.
Q6b. What  are  you  telling  all  of  the  researchers  who  based  their  career  plans  on
NASA’s commitment to support such fundamental and applied microgravity re-
search?

A6b. NASA is moving to the next step to implement the knowledge gathered by the
research  community  on  gravity-driven  phenomena  in  biological  and  physical  sys-
tems,  and  we  will  need  the  research  community’s  further  participation  in  solving
more  focused,  but  no  less  challenging  problems.  The  scope  of  NASA’s  support  to
science  and  technology  may  need  to  increase  as  our  efforts  in  space  exploration  be-
come more substantial in the coming years. New areas of emphasis will provide op-
portunities  for  participants  in  the  previous  fundamental  and  applied  microgravity
research  program  to  contribute  to  solving  problems  and  advancing  technologies  in
areas like in-situ resource utilization for life support and spacecraft propellants, in-
space  multi-phase  fluid  processes  for  propulsion  and  power  generation,  low-gravity
processes  for  fabrication  and  repair,  innovative  technologies  for  medical  and  envi-
ronmental  monitoring  sensors  and  integrated  control  systems,  and  a  variety  of  ad-
vanced  materials  solutions  needed  for  radiation  protection.  The  opportunities  for
contribution  from  this  community  have  not  decreased—they  have  become  more  fo-
cused on space exploration.
Q7. The  last  round  of  Discovery  proposals  (11)  yielded  only  a  ‘‘Mission  of  Oppor-
tunity’’  (the  Moon  Mineralogy  Mapper  instrument  for  the  Indian  Chandrayaan
1  mission)  and  not  a  full  mission.  What  will  happen  to  the  remaining  funds?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00099 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

96

Will  they  be  maintained  within  the  Discovery  program  such  that  there  may  be
funding for two missions in the next round (12)?

A7. The remaining funds will stay within the Discovery Program. The surplus early
year  funding  will  primarily  be  used  to  solve  funding  problems  with  Deep  Impact,
Stardust, and Kepler. Funding from about FY 2007 onward will go toward a poten-
tial  second  selection  in  the  next  AO.  A  second  mission  will  only  be  selected  if  it  is
qualified, and if the proposed funding can be phased such that it is affordable with-
in the current (combined Discovery-11 and -12) budget profile. It is anticipated that
this  will  indeed  be  the  case.  In  the  interim,  NASA  has  assembled  a  review  team
to  assess  our  recent  decisions  on  the  Discovery  Program.  NASA  expects  the  results
of this review in the coming weeks.
Q8a. The  Deep  Space  Network  (DSN)  is  receiving  a  slight  decrease  from  last  year’s
budget.  Your  budget  materials  acknowledge  that  the  DSN  infrastructure  is
starting to show its age and repairs and upgrades are going to be needed. Will
you  have  the  resources  you  need  for  the  approximately  35  missions  the  DSN
will  support  this  year  and  to  prepare  for  the  increasing  data  needs  in  future
years?

A8a. The  DSN  will  continue  to  support  all  current  missions.  The  FY  2006  budget
request and the FY 2005 budget are adequate to support continued operation of the
DSN. Additional investments will be required in the future to support new missions,
and  to  renew  aging  infrastructure.  The  strategy  for  making  these  investments  is
currently under development.
Q8b. What  repairs  and  upgrades  planned  for  the  DSN  to  prepare  it  for  the  increas-
ing  data  needs  expected  in  future  years  will  be  deferred,  delayed,  or  otherwise
negatively impacted as a result of the FY 2006 budget and its five-year runout?
A8b. The Science Mission Directorate is working with the Exploration Systems Mis-
sion  Directorate  to  develop  and  validate  requirements  and  capabilities  for  future
needs.  We  recognize  that  the  DSN  will  need  significant  upgrades  to  satisfy  these
future  needs  and  are  assessing  infrastructure  and  performing  failure  analyses  to
help  determine  how  to  focus  the  effort.  The  specific  plan  will  be  refined  as  part  of
the FY 2007 budget process.
Q8c. Please  provide  the  seven-year  (FY  2004–2010)  budget  plan  for  the  Deep  Space

Network, broken down by category of expenditure.

A8c. The  FY  2006  budget  request  for  the  Deep  Space  Network  is  shown  below,  by
major categories.

Q9. What  are  the  specific  ‘‘schedule  issues’’  that  have  caused  Kepler’s  launch  to  be

delayed apparently indefinitely?

A9. Funding  issues  within  the  Discovery  Program  necessitated  a  reduction  in  the
FY  2005  funding  profile  for  Kepler.  The  total  impact  of  this  reduction  is  still  in
work, but it is expected to result in a six to eight months slip in the Kepler launch
date. This means that Kepler would launch between June and August 2008.
Q10. GLAST  is  having  schedule  delays  in  part  due  to  ‘‘withdrawal  of  international
partners’’—who  are  these  partners,  what  were  they  responsible  for  and  why
have  they  withdrawn?  Besides  schedule,  what  else  will  this  withdrawal  im-
pact?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00100 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

97

A10. GLAST  entered  development  at  the  end  of  2003.  The  Large  Area  Telescope
(LAT)  is  the  primary  instrument  on  this  mission,  and  is  being  developed  under  a
NASA  contract  with  the  Stanford  Linear  Accelerator  Center,  which  is  operated  by
Stanford University for the U.S. Government Department of Energy. The LAT Prin-
cipal Investigator assembled a consortium that includes the U.S. Department of En-
ergy  and  institutions  in  France,  Germany,  Japan,  Italy  and  Sweden  to  develop  and
build this instrument.

During project formulation, the Italian Space Agency, ASI, and the French Space
Agency,  CNES,  went  through  budgetary  reprioritizations  and  withdrew  from  some
of their GLAST LAT activities; ASI withdrew funding for the Malindi ground station
in  Africa,  and  CNES  determined  they  could  no  longer  provide  their  input  to  the
LAT.  The  Italians,  however,  have  continued  to  provide  the  remainder  of  their
planned  contribution  (a  portion  of  the  LAT  silicon  strip  detectors,  the  majority  of
the  LAT  tracker  production  costs,  and  science  support).  The  French  (CNRS/IN2P3
and  CEA/DSM)  are  providing  science  support,  as  well,  and  CNRS/IN2P3  continues
to supply the calorimeter structures.

Prior to the aforementioned changes, GLAST had a working launch target of Sep-
tember  2006.  At  the  time  of  Confirmation  Review  (December  2003),  the  baseline
schedule  launch  of  May  2007  and  the  life  cycle  cost  of  $739.5  million  (as  reported
in  the  FY  2005  NASA  budget  request),  reflected  the  impact  of  these  two  changes
in international participation.

Questions submitted by Representative Michael M. Honda
Q1. There has been a reorganization at NASA HQ in order to better address the Ex-
ploration requirements. What is the impact of this on existing contracts, includ-
ing  research  contracts  and  cooperative  agreements?  Will  NASA  fully  honor  its
existing commitments to the University of California and San Jose State Univer-
sity?

A1. In  2004,  NASA  merged  the  former  Space  and  Earth  Science  Enterprises  into
a single Science Mission Directorate with three themes: The Universe, Solar System
Exploration,  and  Earth-Sun  Systems.  The  science  transformation  also  brought  to-
gether  similar  needs/processes  for  engaging  the  external  scientific  community  in
planning/sponsoring  scientific  research,  mission  solicitation/selection/management,
advanced technology development, and business management.

The research and technology development activities of the former Exploration Sys-
tems Enterprise and former Biological and Physical Research Enterprise have been
merged and are now both managed in the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate
(ESMD).  Organized  in  this  way,  ESMD  will  be  able  to  fully  integrate  the  critical
human  system  element  with  the  broad  engineering  systems  infrastructure  required
for  the  human  exploration  of  the  Solar  System.  This  full  integration  enables  the
early insertion of critical human support requirements to implement safety, sustain-
ability, and exploration crew effectiveness.

The  Science  Mission  Directorate  does  not  plan  to  terminate  any  research  inves-
tigations as a result of reorganization at NASA Headquarters—on the contrary, the
resulting  efficiency  improvements  and  science  coordination  will  most  likely  allow
SMD  to  provide  additional  science  opportunities.  In  particular,  all  current  commit-
ments  from  the  Science,  Exploration  Systems,  and  Education  Mission  Directorates
to the University of California and San Jose State University will be honored.
Q2. With  mission  complexity  and  duration  increasing,  the  challenges  of  autonomy
and  software  dependability  appear  to  be  more  important  than  before.  What  is
NASA  doing  to  address  these  technical  challenges  where  it  has  such  aggressive
requirements?

A2. NASA  has  been  proactive  in  addressing  software  related  issues  for  increased
mission  complexity  and  duration.  The  Agency  is  taking  a  multi-faceted  approach  to
assure  software-supporting  NASA  missions  will  meet  the  technical  challenges  asso-
ciated  with  an  aggressive  set  of  requirements.  Highlights  of  the  Agency’s  approach
include:

a) In  the  final  quarter  of  2004,  NASA  issued  a  new  set  of  procedural  require-
ments  (NPR  7150.2,  Software  Engineering  Requirements)  and  significantly
updated  two  NASA  standards  (NASA–STD–8739.8,  NASA  Software  Assur-
ance Standard, and NASA–STD–8719.13, Software Safety Standard).

b) The  NASA  Independent  Verification  and  Validation  (IV&V)  Facility  is  the
Agency’s  agent  for  the  development  and  application  of 
independent
verification  and  validation  processes  and  technology  to  improve  reliability

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00101 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

98

and  reduce  risk  in  software  systems.  The  NASA  IV&V  Facility,  located  in
Fairmont, West Virginia, has been performing verification and validation on
mission  critical  software  across  the  Agency’s  missions  and  projects  for  over
10 years.

c) In  January  2005,  the  NASA  Chief  Engineer  issued  a  Technical  Warrant  for
the discipline of software engineering. The goal of the NASA Technical War-
rant  system  is  to  establish  and  execute  a  standard,  formal  process  for  dele-
gating technical authority from the Chief Engineer to competent experienced
individuals  conducting  and  overseeing  high-risk  technical  work  in  order  to
assure safe and reliable operations and missions.

d) NASA  has  funded  research  to  improve  the  dependability  of  software  inten-
sive  systems.  Two  of  these  programs  of  note  are  the  High-Dependability
Computing Program (HDCP) and the Software Assurance Research Program
(SARP).

e) NASA  has  an  ongoing  commitment  to  the  NASA  Software  Engineering  Ini-
tiative Implementation Plan established in January 2002. This initiative de-
fines a NASA-wide comprehensive approach for improving software engineer-
ing to a quantifiable maturity level commensurate with mission criticality in
order to meet the software challenges of missions and projects. This initiative
employs the common frameworks of the Software-Capability Maturity Model
(SW–CMM)  and  the  CMM  Integrated  (CMMI)  developed  under  the  auspices
of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.

f) The  NASA  Engineering  Training  program  provides  Agency-wide  training  to
advance  software  engineering  skills  and  assure  critical  personnel  are  prop-
erly trained in this discipline.

g) The NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) at Langley Research Cen-
ter maintains a Software Super Problem Resolution Team to coordinate and
conduct  robust,  independent  engineering  and  safety  assessments  across  the
Agency.

Q3. The Vision for Space Exploration is clearly a long-term goal. To accomplish such
a long-term goal will take long-term stability and excellence within the Agency’s
technical infrastructure. Yet management is diverting much of its funds to meet
short-term  goals  while  sacrificing  critical  in-house  core  competencies  and
science.  The  Columbia  Accident  Investigation  Board  warned  that  excessive
downsizing  of  the  in-house  technical  competence  contributed  to  the  Columbia
disaster,  but  NASA  is  accelerating  this  process  rather  than  reversing  it.  How  is
NASA  incorporating  this  lesson-learned  from  the  Shuttle  loss  into  its  workforce
plan?

A3. NASA is taking a deliberate, thoughtful and targeted approach to realigning its
workforce to meet the Exploration Vision. This means that the competencies needed
to  accomplish  its  current  and  expected  future  work  are  being  identified  through  an
analysis  of  NASA’s  core  organizational  and  workforce  competencies.  NASA’s  work-
force  will  be  realigned  in  a  manner  that  ensures  retention  of  needed  competencies
and avoids any skill gaps that may impact the success and safety of future missions.
NASA’s  field  centers  are  fully  engaged  in  this  review  of  the  Agency’s  competency
needs.  Their  assessments  are  a  critical  part  of  the  decision  process  and  key  to  the
short- and long-term stability of the Agency.
Q4. I would like to draw your attention to a table on page SD 5–1 of the budget ma-
terials  your  agency  supplied  to  Congress.  This  table  shows  Civil  Service  Dis-
tribution of Full Time Equivalent employees at the Centers. I will focus on Ames
Research  Center  in  particular,  since  it  is  adjacent  to  my  district.  The  table
shows  what  can  best  be  described  as  simple  attrition-type  decreases  in  FTEs.
However,  on  February  7th,  Ames’  Center  director  announced  to  his  entire  staff
that  the  FY  2006  budget  would  require,  among  other  things,  a  reduction  of
about  400  Civil  Service  employees  and  an  equal  number  of  on-site  contractors
over  the  next  year  and  a  half.  Similar  draconian  announcements  have  been
made by Glenn and Langley’s Center directors. Please tell me where do the num-
bers  come  from  in  your  glossy  notebook?  And  why  is  NASA  telling  Congress
something  so  vastly  different  from  what  the  employees  at  the  Centers  are  being
told?

A4. The  FTE  levels  on  page  SD  5–1  represent  the  NASA  workforce  only  through
FY  2006  and  do  not  show  the  workforce  currently  budgeted  for  funded  programs
from  FY  2007  to  FY  2010.  The  chart  below  shows  the  complete  workforce  runout
through  2010  and  shows  the  400  FTE  reduction  in  the  level  of  the  workforce  cur-
rently  budgeted  for  funded  programs  through  FY  2010  at  Ames  Research  Center.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00102 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

99

Similar situations exist at Glenn and Langley Research Centers. To a degree, these
lower  budgeted  workforce  levels  reflect  the  fact  that  we  are  still  engaged  in  an  as-
sessment of the workforce required to fulfill the Vision for Space Exploration.

We  are  matching  needed  skills  with  funded  work  both  at  the  Centers  currently
showing reductions and at other Centers that continue to hire. There is a lot of pro-
grammatic funding in the budget runout that is not yet assigned to a particular cen-
ter,  contractor,  or  research  institution.  Billions  of  dollars  of  work  will  be  available
for competition as the Exploration program proceeds with its overall program defini-
tion, as well as its systems engineering and integration effort and Crew Exploration
Vehicle  activity.  There  will  be  work  available  in  various  competitive  science  areas,
such as the Discovery and Mars programs.

We  are  currently  assessing  the  health  of  NASA’s  core  competencies  required  to
support the Vision, a process that will be repeated on an annual basis in conjunction
with  the  budget  development.  Our  core  competency  sustaining  strategy  focuses  on
competition  as  the  preferred  approach  for  bringing  to  a  Center  the  necessary  level
of  work  to  sustain  a  core  competency.  However,  this  strategy  further  provides  for
alternative sustaining approaches when, for example, a gap in competition opportu-
nities puts a core competency at risk. The Centers will be responsible for identifying
where  they  are  unable  to  sustain  the  critical  level  from  the  resources  available  to
them.  Mission  Directorates  will  be  responsible  for  providing  needed  resources,  or  if
that  is  not  feasible,  bringing  the  issue  forward  to  the  Agency  leadership  where  a
tailored investment strategy will be developed.

In addition to work associated with the Vision, it is anticipated that Centers will
pursue  reimbursable  work  for  non-NASA  customers  in  their  areas  of  special  com-
petence.  In  this  regard,  Centers  may  consider  alternative  management  structures
for more flexibility to pursue reimbursable tasks.

As  a  result  of  these  activities,  the  workforce  levels  in  the  budget  runout  will  in-
crease to the extent additional FTE are needed to support identified and funded pro-
gram requirements.

Q5. I  have  got  some  questions  about  the  way  in  which  you  are  introducing  a  com-
petitive paradigm to the NASA. It appears that in-house Civil Service employees
are  marginalized  or  excluded  by  chaotic,  rushed,  and  unprofessional  proposal
and review processes and by outsourcing quotas. Can you comment on the proce-
dures  that  have  been  used  for  both  intramural  and  extramural  calls  for  pro-
posals  by  ESMD,  on  the  shorter  timelines  provided  for  intramural  proposers,
and  on  the  pre-determined  allocation  of  greater  funds  for  external  calls  for  pro-
posals than internal calls?

A5. New space technology developments are critical to the success of the Vision for
Space  Exploration.  However,  to  have  an  impact,  these  new  developments  must  be
properly focused on the most important technical challenges that face NASA in real-
izing a long-term program of exploration that is sustainable and affordable.

Because several of NASA’s technology development efforts must be effectively and
efficiently  focused  on  exploration,  a  year  long,  multi-step  process  was  used  during
FY  2004  and  early  FY  2005  to  reformulate  and  refocus  ongoing  NASA  space  tech-
nology  R&D  programs.  This  reformulation  process  began  in  February  2004  with  a
‘zero  base  review’  of  ongoing  technology  projects  in  the  former  Mission  and  Science
Measurement  Technology  Program,  which  were  transferred  to  the  Exploration  Sys-
tems  Mission  Directorate  (ESMD)  from  the  Office  of  Aerospace  Technology.  At  the
same time, various studies within NASA and ESMD better defined initial objectives,
schedules,  requirements,  and  a  spiral  development  approach  for  exploration  in  the
context  of  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration.  On  the  basis  of  the  Vision  and  the
emerging requirements set, NASA established a new Exploration Systems Research
and  Technology  theme  (ESR&T)  to  develop  the  critical  technologies  needed  for  fu-
ture  exploration  missions.  The  ESR&T  theme  includes  the  Advanced  Space  Tech-
nology  Program,  the  Technology  Maturation  Program,  the  Innovative  Partnerships
Program, and the Centennial Challenges Program.

Following  the  creation  of  the  ESR&T  theme,  a  NASA-wide  team  was  established
(involving every Center and over 100 individuals) to implement program-level plan-
ning  efforts.  This  team  developed  content  for  an  ESR&T  Formulation  Plan,  which
was  issued  in  March,  2004.  The  ESR&T  Formulation  Plan  outlined  the  major  ele-
ments  of  each  program,  identified  the  technical  areas  that  would  be  addressed  to
meet  exploration  mission  needs,  and  established  the  processes  for  selecting  new
technology development activities.

The  selection  process  for  new  projects  involved  two  separate  competitions:  an  In-
tramural Call for Proposals (ICP) issued in May 2004 to select projects led by NASA
Centers,  and  a  Broad  Agency  Announcement  (BAA)  issued  in  July  2004  to  select
projects  led  by  external  organizations.  Both  solicitations  were  based  on  the  critical
technology needs identified in the ESR&T Formulation Plan. This two-part selection
process was designed to encourage partnerships between the NASA Centers and ex-
ternal  organizations,  to  insure  that  the  best  ideas  from  all  organizations  would  be
proposed without concern for intellectual property infringement, and that technology
development  activities  would  be  focused  on  practical  applications  and  successfully
infused  into  NASA  missions.  In  the  ICP  projects,  the  majority  of  the  work  is  per-
formed by NASA researchers, with participating team members from industry, uni-
versities,  and  other  government  agencies.  In  the  BAA  projects,  the  majority  of  the
work  is  performed  by  external  researchers,  with  NASA  personnel  participating  as
collaborators.

Although both ICP and BAA processes were conducted on an aggressive schedule
(about  100  days  in  duration  from  release  of  a  solicitation  to  announcement  of
awards),  both  efforts  provided  approximately  two  weeks  for  proposers  to  develop
their  one-page,  non-binding  Notices  of  Intent  (NOIs),  and  30  days  to  develop  their
full proposals.

Both solicitations were highly competitive. Over 1300 NOIs were submitted to the
ICP,  and  these  were  evaluated  for  their  relevance  to  exploration  mission  needs  by
the ESR&T management team at NASA Headquarters. Based on the relevance eval-
uations, 147 NASA investigators were invited to submit full proposals. The full pro-
posals  were  then  reviewed  for  technical  merit,  management  approach,  and  cost  by
an  external  peer  review  panel,  and  48  intramural  projects  were  selected  based  on
the  peer  review  panel  recommendations.  The  ICP  resulted  in  $573  million  in  new
project awards.

For  the  BAA,  over  3,700  Notices  of  Intent  were  submitted.  A  team  of  reviewers
from the NASA Centers evaluated the relevance of the NOIs, and 498 full proposals
were  invited.  The  full  proposals  were  evaluated  by  peer  review  panels  consisting  of
over 100 non-conflicted NASA and university reviewers, and 70 extramural projects
were selected. The BAA resulted in an additional $1.1 billion in new project awards.
Guidelines were established for the approximate scope of work to be led by either
NASA or non-NASA investigators. However, there was no ‘quota’ that set fixed lim-
its  on  the  funding  that  could  go  to  intramural  versus  extramural  projects.  The  ac-
tual  selections  were  based  on  the  competitive  evaluations  and  the  availability  of
funds.  The  NASA  Centers  received  approximately  50  percent  of  available  program
funding,  both  as  principal  investigators  on  the  intramural  projects  and  as  collabo-
rators on the extramural projects. The two-part competitive selection approach using
the  ICP  and  the  BAA  resulted  in  over  250  collaborations  among  NASA  and  non-
NASA investigators, which was the original intent.

The  Exploration  Mission  Directorate  is  committed  to  enhancing  all  of  our  proc-
esses,  as  we  evolve.  Thus,  based  on  lessons  learned  from  the  initial  ICP  and  BAA
competitions,  we  will  be  adapting  our  processes  for  future  ICP  and  BAA  competi-
tions  to  ensure  that  we  obtain  the  best  value  for  the  government,  from  all  sources,

including NASA field centers, industry, and universities. Specific suggestions for im-
provement are always welcome.
Q6. What  is  going  to  happen  if  you  realize  in  the  future  that  some  of  the  expert  sci-
entists and engineers that you have identified today as ‘‘excess competencies’’ and
are eliminating (or planning to) through buy-outs and other means are actually
required  to  accomplish  the  Vision  and  you  want  to  hire  those  employees  back?
From  what  I  hear  about  the  brutal  way  employees  and  contractors  are  being
treated  right  now,  they  are  not  likely  to  want  to  go  to  work  for  NASA  in  the
future  and  you  are  likely  creating  future  recruiting  problems  for  the  Agency
among  those  best  and  brightest  scientists  and  engineers  who  can  expect  much
better  treatment  from  academia  and  industry  even  in  times  of  economy  hard-
ship.  If  it  is  necessary  to  execute  Reductions  in  Force  (RIFs),  will  you  commit
to doing this in a reasonable manner and at a responsible pace after consulting
with  Congress  through  the  annual  workforce  plan  review  process?  Why  not  re-
quire  direct  funding  of  R&D  Civil  Service  salaries  at  the  centers  at  maybe  half
of  the  current  level  in  FY06,  and  ramping  this  down  over  the  following  couple
of  years  to  allow  for  an  orderly  and  fair  transition  to  a  more  competitive  envi-
ronment?  This  phase  out  would  allow  for  a  smooth  and  rational  transition  to
Full-Cost Management, in which 1) in-house proposers can transition off of their
current  tasks  and  compete  for  future  funding  opportunities  and  2)  Centers  can
properly  shed  institutional  burdens  to  reset  overhead.  It  would  seem  that  de-
manding  immediate  change  of  both  proposers  and  Centers  is  unrealistic  and  is
driving the unnecessary loss of in-house capabilities and expertise.

A6. NASA  is  taking  a  deliberate  and  thoughtful  approach  to  realigning  its  work-
force  to  meet  the  Exploration  Vision.  This  means  that  the  competencies  needed  to
accomplish  its  current  and  expected  future  work  are  being  identified  through  an
analysis  of  NASA’s  core  organizational  and  workforce  competencies.  NASA’s  work-
force  will  be  realigned  in  a  manner  that  ensures  retention  of  needed  competencies
and avoids any skill gaps that may impact the success and safety of future missions.
The  process  for  assessing  and  revisiting  the  health  of  our  core  competencies  is  ad-
dressed  in  the  answer  to  Question  4.  All  civil  service  staff  is  funded  through  FY
2006 to allow us to conduct this realignment using a strategic, deliberate approach,
with  a  reduction  in  force  as  a  last  resort  effort  that  will  only  be  considered  if  all
of  our  voluntary  efforts  (job  fairs,  buy-outs)  are  not  successful.  For  competitive  op-
portunities,  Centers  are  permitted  to  use  overhead  rates  for  FY  2005  and  FY  2006
that  exclude  the  additional  cost  burden  of  uncovered  capacity,  so  the  overhead  rate
is ‘‘reset.’’
Q7. How many managers and non-clerical administrative employees does NASA em-
ploy? How has this workforce sector been changing over the last four years? My
reading of the numbers is that the ratio has bloated to a level of almost one ad-
ministrative  non-clerical  employee  for  every  two  R&D  employees  (I  believe  at
Ames  there  are  about  400  non-clerical  administrative  employees  for  about  800
scientists and engineers). How do you justify that ratio for an agency with such
ambitious  technical  goals?  Any  private  R&D/engineering  company  with  num-
bers  like  that  would  be  ‘‘transforming’’  itself  by  getting  rid  of  mid-level  man-
agers.  Why  isn’t  NASA  planning  a  focused  reduction  in  its  management  work-
force?

A7. During  the  last  four  years  NASA’s  civil  servant  science  and  engineering  posi-
tions have increased from 10,957 positions to 11, 287 positions while non-clerical ad-
ministrative civil servant positions have increased from 4,454 positions to 5,181 po-
sitions. The size of NASA’s non-clerical administrative workforce needs to be viewed
in  the  context  of  NASA’s  overall  science  and  engineering  workforce,  which  includes
the  contractor  workforce.  For  example,  in  addition  to  the  civil  servant  population,
NASA  employs  over  25,000  on-site  contractor  staff  and  another  5,000  employees  at
the  Jet  Propulsion  Laboratory.  These  employees  are  predominately  involved  in
science and engineering work.

NASA’s  civil  service  professional/administrative  workforce  serve  in  important
business management functions, such as procurement, contract administration, and
financial  management,  that  are  necessary  to  ensure  prudent  stewardship  of  re-
sources entrusted to the Agency.
Q8a. How  much  of  NASA’s  current  workforce  turmoil  and  financial  uncertainty  are

due to the Agency’s adoption of SAP financial management software?

A8a. The  current  workforce  turmoil  and  financial  uncertainty  are  due  to  Trans-
formational  realignment  activities,  and  not  SAP  software.  In  FY  2003,  the  Inte-
grated  Financial  Management  Program  consolidated  ten  Center-based  accounting

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00105 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

102

systems and approximately 200 independent sub-systems and transitioned to a sin-
gle, Agency-wide accounting system. This exposed many problems with the integrity
of  historical  data  and  weaknesses  in  financial  practices  and  internal  controls.
Through  the  IFM  Program  and  the  Office  of  the  CFO,  NASA  is  in  fact  working  to
provide  greater  certainty  and  confidence  in  the  financial  data  and  management  in-
formation it presents to its managers.
Q8b. Management  policies  are  often  changed  to  fit  the  software,  rather  the  product
fitting  the  agency’s  needs.  And  while  this  software  system  is  something  NASA
brags  about  in  its  budget,  because  adopting  it  got  NASA  a  green  light,  rumor
has  it  that  it  has  ‘‘transformed’’  the  process  of  getting  a  purchase  order  from
something  that  used  to  take  an  hour  to  something  that  can  now  take  months.
How is this helping run the Agency?

A8b. Best practice—and in fact federal guidance—for implementing Commercial Off
The  Shelf  (COTS)  information  technology  systems  dictate  changing  organizational
structures and business processes to fit the software, and not the reverse.

NASA  is  currently  not  rated  at  ‘‘green’’  for  financial  management.  Nevertheless,
we  are  proud  of  our  achievements,  especially  given  that  the  industry  standard
shows that less than a third of similar programs succeed.

The  SAP  solution  requires  the  fiscal  discipline  of  understanding  basic  finance,
knowing relevant procurement information, and more importantly, having the avail-
ability of funding before obligating taxpayer dollars. Should an organization or user
possess this fiscal discipline and have funding available, transaction times are mini-
mal.  This  level  of  internal  control  and  fiscal  discipline  is  imperative  if  NASA  is  to
be struck from the GAO’s High Risk List.
Q8c. Why  was  SAP  (a  German  software  product)  selected  as  opposed  to  Oracle  (a

U.S. product)?

A8c. The  software  selected  by  NASA  was  made  in  accordance  with  a  competitive
procurement process in line with Federal Acquisition Regulations. These regulations
require  that  all  federal  agencies  procure  from  approved  suppliers  on  the  U.S.  Gen-
eral Services Administration’s (GSA’s) Financial Management Supply Schedule, and
that any financial systems also be certified by the Joint Financial Management Im-
provement  Program  (JFMIP.)  Neither  the  GSA  nor  the  JFMIP  have  excluded  non-
U.S. suppliers.
Q8d. Why is JPL not using SAP?
A8d. The  Jet  Propulsion  Lab  (JPL)  is  a  Federally  Funded  Research  and  Develop-
ment Center (FFRDC) operated under contract by California Institute of Technology
(CaITech)  CaITech,  in  this  instance,  is  like  any  other  federal  contractor,  and  is  at
liberty to operate the business software of its choice. Lockheed Martin and Northrop
Grumman, two significant NASA contractors, have chosen SAP.
Q9. What is the value of fully completing the ISS if most of its scientific capabilities
are being abandoned? What exactly is NASA expecting to accomplish either tech-
nically or scientifically with ISS and how does this justify the continued invest-
ment  of  billions  of  dollars  and  28  risky  Shuttle  flights?  How  specifically  does
ISS  contribute  to  the  Exploration  Vision  given  its  severely  limited  capabilities?
Would reprogramming some ISS, funds (by reducing the number Shuttle flights
and limiting some ISS goals) over to CEV1 development allow for an earlier de-
livery  of  CEV  and  associated  independence  from  Soyuz  (along  with  the  reduced
exposure to Shuttle failure)?

A9. NASA is in the process of focusing and prioritizing its research and technology
development efforts for the International Space Station (ISS) on areas that best con-
tribute  to  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration.  ISS  provides  a  unique  environment  in
which the astronaut crew can carry out scientific research, investigating the effects
of  the  space  environment  both  on  human  physiology  as  well  as  on  spacecraft  sys-
tems.  NASA  has  identified  22  areas  of  research  and  technology  that  can  be  carried
out  on  the  International  Space  Station  to  reduce  the  risk  associated  with  future
human  exploration  missions.  The  ISS  can  specifically  contribute  to  the  Vision  for
Space  Exploration  in  areas  such  as:  testing  and  validating  performance  of  closed
loop  life  support  systems;  testing  and  validating  both  pharmaceuticals  and  new  ex-
ercise  systems  to  maintain  astronaut  health,  and;  demonstrating  technologies  nec-
essary  for  future  space  systems  such  as  thermal  control,  power  generation,  and
management of cryogenic fuels in space.

In  response  to  the  question  of  whether  the  CEV  could  be  ready  sooner,  currently
CEV development is paced by existing technology maturation timelines and the de-
velopment and demonstration of a reliable human-rated launch system, all of which

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00106 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

103

are  constrained  by  available  resources.  While  preliminary  indications  are  that  the
CEV development could be accelerated, impacts relative to additional costs, perform-
ance, program risks, and what actual schedule acceleration can be achieved are yet
to be determined. The Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) is initiating
a six-month study to determine potential CEV schedule acceleration and the concur-
rent  impact  on  performance,  cost,  and  risk.  It  is  unlikely  that  CEV  deployment
could occur as early as 2010, when the Shuttle will be retired.

Questions submitted by Representative Sheila Jackson Lee
Q1a. Members  of  the  Committee  were  told  during  the  NASA  budget  hearing  that
money for safety activities was not put in its own separate budget function but
spread throughout the NASA budget.
What is the combined total amount of funding in the NASA budget for safety?
A1a. Safety  is  one  of  NASA’s  core  values  and  is  embedded  in  all  we  do  throughout
the  Agency.  There  are  certain  safety  related  activities  that  can  be  explicitly  identi-
fied in our budget, and total over $400 million in the FY 2006 request. They include
items  in  Corporate  G&A  such  as  the  NASA  Engineering  &  Safety  Center  (NESC),
Safety  &  Mission  Assurance  (S&MA),  and  Independent  Verification  &  Validation
(IV&V);  Center  G&A  for  S&MA;  and,  Service  Pools  for  S&MA  and  Independent
Technical Authority (ITA). However, this approximate $400 million does not include
the amounts expended routinely within programs and projects that contribute to the
safety posture of programs and projects outside these specific budget categories, nor
does it include safety funding embedded in the work of NASA’s contractors.
Q1b. How do the total safety budget projections for the next five years compare with

the last two years?

A1b. For  the  next  five  years,  FY  2006  to  FY  2010,  the  identified  safety  related
budget  of  over  approximately  $400  million  annually  (see  (a)  above)  is  increasing  at
approximately  the  rate  of  inflation.  There  have  been  some  recent  changes  to  ele-
ments  of  the  overall  safety  and  related  budgets  that  make  it  difficult  to  compare
the  last  two  years.  These  changes  include  the  creation  of  service  pools  for  ITA  and
S&MA, which did not exist previously. However, over the past two years, there have
been  specific  increases  in  the  Corporate  G&A  portion  of  the  identified  safety  and
related funding, for both NESC (an expected ramp-up as that organization has been
established)  and  S&MA.  The  total  funding  for  these  activities  increased  more  than
40 percent from FY 2004 to FY 2005 and then 16 percent from FY 2005 to FY 2006,
after which they level off to roughly inflationary increases.
Q2. How many NASA employees will be laid off due to the proposed plan for restruc-
turing? How does NASA project this proposed restructuring to affect recruitment,
since  rumors  of  layoffs  or  closings  may  dissuade  those  who  may  have  wanted
to join NASA?

A2. NASA  is  taking  a  deliberate  and  thoughtful  approach  to  realigning  its  work-
force  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration.  Any  reduction
in  force  (RIF)  that  may  be  needed  has  always  been  considered  an  activity  of  ‘‘last
resort.’’ Rather, NASA is currently engaged in Agency-wide initiatives to avoid RIF.
These include offering a second round of voluntary separation incentives (‘‘buyouts’’)
and early retirement opportunities at most Centers in April 2005. An earlier round
of  buyouts  was  offered  in  December  2004.  Also,  the  Agency  just  concluded  a  series
of internal job fairs at Langley Research Center, Glenn Research Center, Ames Re-
search  Center  and  Dryden  Flight  Research  Center  designed  to  realign  employees.
Hiring  managers  are  currently  in  the  process  of  selecting  from  among  the  job  fair
applicants. In addition, the Langley Research Center conducted a very successful job
fair  of  private  sector  employers  that  they  hope  will  provide  job  opportunities  for
their  employees.  NASA  is  hopeful  that  these  and  similar  future  RIF  avoidance  ac-
tivities  will  obviate  the  need  for  a  reduction  in  force  as  a  result  of  restructuring.
In  addition,  there  are  ongoing  efforts  to  match  needed  skills  with  funded  work.
There  will  be  additional  work  available  for  competition  as  the  Exploration  program
proceeds with its overall program definition, as well as its Crew Exploration Vehicle
activity.  Work  will  also  be  available  in  various  competitive  science  areas,  such  as
the Discovery and Mars programs.

NASA’s ongoing health assessment of its core competencies may result in the ap-
plication  of  additional  program  resources  to  sustain  critical  workforce.  It  is  antici-
pated  Centers  will  pursue  reimbursable  work  for  non-NASA  customers  in  their
areas  of  special  competence.  Centers  may  also  consider  alternative  management
structures for more flexibility to pursue reimbursable tasks. As a result of these ef-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00107 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

104

forts,  many  of  the  FTEs  not  yet  supported  will  likely  be  matched  with  funded  re-
quirements.

NASA  will  continue  to  conduct  outreach  and  recruitment  activities.  The  Agency
needs  to  be  positioned  to  attract  candidates  with  the  competencies  required  to  sup-
port the Exploration Vision. Additionally, we must continue to focus on maintaining
a  pipeline  of  recent  graduates,  particularly  in  the  science  and  engineering  fields,
and  will  use  tools  such  as  the  NASA  Science  &  Technology  Scholarship  Program
(STSP). This program will award scholarships to individuals to prepare them for ca-
reers  at  NASA.  In  exchange  for  tuition  scholarships  and  stipends,  STSP  award  re-
cipients  must  agree  to  fulfill  a  service  obligation  following  graduation.  The  service
obligation equates to serving a two-year appointment with NASA for each academic
year  under  the  scholarship,  up  to  a  maximum  of  four  required  years  of  service.  As
always,  NASA  will  also  continue  to  hire  students  through  the  Student  Education
and  Employment  Program.  Our  ongoing  outreach  and  recruitment  efforts  will  en-
sure that the Agency has the appropriate competencies necessary to continue to sup-
port NASA’s mission.

Questions submitted by Representative Jim Matheson
Q1. How does NASA actually set its budget priorities?
A1. NASA’s budget priorities are guided by the President’s direction, as outlined in
his  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  announced  in  January  2004.  His  Vision  provides
a  historic  opportunity  to  focus  NASA  for  the  long-term.  The  Vision  was  defined  in
a policy document called ‘‘A Renewed Spirit of Discovery: The President’s Vision for
U.S. Space Exploration.’’ NASA has outlined new objectives in ‘‘The New Age of Ex-
ploration,’’  which  lays  out  the  new  approach  to  space  exploration.  The  FY  2006
Budget Request maintains resolute focus on exploration priorities and critical mile-
stones  defined  by  the  President’s  direction,  and  informed  by  our  science  priorities.
Consistent  with  the  Vision,  the  FY  2006  Budget  Request  supports  critical  National
needs and revolutionary technologies in other priority areas, including Aeronautics,
Earth Science and Education.
Q2. Why  do  you  think  that  sacrificing  NASA’s  science  and  aeronautics  programs  to
fund  the  exploration  initiative  will  be  compelling  to  the  Congress,  in  terms  of
securing Congressional support? It seems to me that the manned missions to the
Moon and Mars are being paid for at the expense of science missions.

A2. While  there  were  reductions  in  science  and  aeronautics  programs  made  in  the
FY  2006  Budget  Request  relative  to  earlier  plans,  those  reductions  were  not  made
to fund the Vision for Space Exploration. In the FY 2006 budget request, reductions
were  required  in  all  four  Mission  Directorates  as  part  of  a  government-wide  effort
to  reduce  the  deficit,  and  the  need  to  adequately  fund  the  Space  Shuttle  return-to-
flight activities. The net reductions relative to FY 2006 plans in the FY 2005 budget
request were: Science -$274 million; Aeronautics -$105 million; and Exploration Sys-
tems -$406 million. Note that the largest reduction was in Exploration Systems.

NASA continues to support important National priorities in Earth Science, Space
Science  and  Aeronautics.  Science  remains  a  key  driver  in  the  Vision  for  Space  Ex-
ploration. Funding levels in Science are increasing in the FY06 budget request, with
an increase of 23 percent over current levels by 2010. Furthermore, the overall per-
centage  of  NASA’s  budget  going  to  the  Science  Mission  Directorate  increases  from
33 percent in 2006 to 38 percent by 2010. NASA continues to build the next genera-
tion of space telescopes, prepare for robotic missions to the Moon and Mars, and de-
velop  new  technologies  to  study  our  own  planet.  In  Aeronautics  Research,  the  FY
2006  Budget  Request  fully  supports  vital  research  in  Aviation  Safety  and  Security
and Airspace Systems programs in close cooperation with FAA. In Vehicle Systems,
the program’s focus has changed from evolutionary to revolutionary, high-risk, ‘‘bar-
rier breaking’’ technologies.
Q3. Why did NASA decide to cancel funding for the Hubble servicing mission, given
its popularity with American citizens and its significant contributions to science?
A3. The decision not to pursue a Space Shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble was
based  on  a  relative  risk  analysis  and  operational  complexity.  While  all  space  flight
is inherently risky, there are both on-orbit and ground processing requirements that
would be notably unique to a Hubble servicing mission. For a Hubble servicing mis-
sion,  the  options  and  available  time  for  dealing  with  an  on-orbit  emergency  are
greatly reduced, posing additional risk to the mission.

NASA has developed a five-point flight rationale (addressing safety requirements)
for Space Shuttle RTF, which is grounded in the recommendations of the CAIB and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00108 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

105

predicated  on  primary  hazard  control,  warning  devices  and  special  procedures.  The
first two elements of that flight rationale (Elimination of Critical Debris and Impact
Detection During Ascent) rely upon Space Shuttle hardware, infrastructure, and pro-
cedural improvements that broadly apply to all missions, including those to destina-
tions  other  than  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS).  However,  the  efforts  of  the
Space  Shuttle  program  to  meet  the  three  remaining  elements  of  the  RTF  flight  ra-
tionale  (On-Orbit  Debris  Impact/Damage  Detection;  On-Orbit  Thermal  Protection
System Repair; and, Crew Rescue) assume access to the resources of the ISS. Devel-
oping the additional capabilities necessary to meet these three elements of the flight
rationale for a Hubble servicing mission would entail additional risks above and be-
yond those inherent in a mission to the ISS.

To  apply  this  same  flight  rationale  to  a  Hubble  servicing  mission,  NASA  would
have  to  develop  new  capabilities  that  are  analogous  to  those  provided  by  the  ISS.
The Orbiter Boom Sensor System would have to be extensively modified, or an alter-
native  capability  would  need  to  be  created.  Additionally,  a  way  would  need  to  be
found  to  sustain  the  crew  of  a  hopelessly  crippled  Orbiter  with  limited  life-support
capabilities  long  enough  for  a  second  Shuttle  to  be  launched  on  a  rescue  mission.
That  rescue  mission,  in  turn,  would  need  to  be  processed  at  the  same  time  as  the
Hubble servicing mission itself, a situation that would be highly complex, would re-
quire  double  the  normal  workload  on  ground  launch  and  processing  teams,  and
would put an unprecedented strain on the overall Shuttle system. Finally, a rescue
mission  would  require  many  unproven  techniques,  such  as  emergency  free-space
crew  transfer  in  space  suits  while  performing  Space  Shuttle  to  Space  Shuttle  sta-
tion-keeping. Being based at the ISS offers the advantages of multiple hatches, air-
locks,  and  established  docking  and  evacuation  procedures,  which  would  afford  a
shirt-sleeve, nominal transfer of crew from the ISS to the rescue Orbiter.

Based on analysis of the relative risks, operational complexity and implicit sched-
ule  pressure,  NASA  has  decided  not  to  proceed  with  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission  of
Hubble.

In terms of a robotic servicing mission, the Hubble program office estimated a cost
of $1.3 billion over 39 months, with launch in December 2007. Independent reviews
have  concluded  costs  could  approach  $2  billion  and  development  schedule  could  ex-
tend  past  5  years.  Starting  in  2006,  Hubble  could  begin  to  lose  some  pointing  con-
trol. More importantly, batteries are degrading and could become inadequate to pro-
tect  Hubble  in  the  2008–2009  timeframe,  after  which  point  Hubble  would  be
unsalvageable. Hubble’s orbit will not decay to re-entry until the middle of the next
decade.

The  National  Academy  of  Sciences  (NAS)  Report  released  in  December  2004  con-
cluded that the likelihood of successful Hubble robotic servicing was highly improb-
able.  The  Report  strongly  recommended  termination  of  robotic  servicing  in  favor  of
a de-orbit only mission:

—‘‘[A]  robotic  mission  should  be  pursued  solely  to  de-orbit  Hubble.’’  (emphasis
added)

Based  on  the  unambiguous  and  very  strong  NAS  recommendation,  NASA  can  no
longer defend continued effort in support of Hubble robotic servicing. NASA is devel-
oping  a  plan  to  refocus  the  program  to  a  de-orbit  mission.  The  PDR  occurred,  but
was focused on inventorying work done to date and on identifying the best approach
to the de-orbit only mission. The new NASA Administrator has stated his intention
to  revisit  the  earlier  decision  to  not  service  Hubble  with  Shuttle  in  light  of  what
NASA learns after the Shuttle returns to flight.
Q4. In  what  ways  could  the  preservation  and  extension  of  the  Hubble  Space  Tele-
scope help our understanding of dark energy and provide useful insights for fu-
ture dark energy missions?

A4. Astronomers use measurements of distant supernovae (explosions of aged stars)
in  other  galaxies  to  determine  how  fast  the  universe  was  expanding  at  the  time  of
the explosion that began the life of our Universe. The Hubble Space Telescope, along
with ground-based telescopes, has been used to trace this ‘‘expansion history’’ of the
universe,  and  has  contributed  to  the  recent  surprise  conclusion  that  the  expansion
of the universe is currently accelerating (after initially slowing down due to gravity).
The physical phenomenon behind this acceleration is not yet understood and is often
termed  ‘‘dark  energy.’’  Observations  of  more  supernovae  allow  the  refinement  of
knowledge  of  the  amount  of  cosmic  deceleration  and  acceleration  over  the  history
of  the  universe  and  better  determination  of  numerical  parameters  that  define  the
‘‘dark  energy.’’  Over  the  next  few  years,  the  Advanced  Camera  for  Surveys  on
Hubble  will  continue  to  be  used  as  a  search  engine  to  find  many  more  supernovae.
Future  telescopes  may  be  designed  with  much  larger  fields-of-view  than  available

er period.

Questions submitted by Representative Brad Miller
Q1. Please  provide  a  breakdown  of  the  budget  for  NASA’s  commercial  technology

and technology transfer programs for the years FY 2004–2010.

A1. The  outyear  estimates  used  to  construct  the  2006  President’s  Budget  are  re-
flected in the chart below.

Q2. In  what  specific  ways  have  you  modified  NASA’s  technology  transfer  programs
in  response  to  the  National  Academy  of  Public  Administration’s  review  of  those
programs?

A2. The goals of the newly organized Innovative Partnerships Program (IPP) are to:
1) make the Vision for Space Exploration affordable through partnerships; and,
2) make it sustainable by creating benefits to the public.

The Innovative Partnerships Program includes the following elements

• Technology Transfer
• Small Business Innovative Research—SBIR
• Small Business Technology Transfer—STTR

• Industry-Led Partnerships
• University-Led Partnerships

Æ The Research Partnership Centers (RPCs)
Æ University Research Engineering Technology Institutes (URETIs)

Responses  to  National  Academy  of  Public  Administration  (NAPA)  recommenda-

tions are as follows (numbering corresponds to NAPA Report):

1. Demonstrated Leadership Commitment: NASA has committed to an improved
technology  transfer  effort  by  committing  new  funds  in  the  FY  2006  Presi-
dent’s  Budget  request.  The  nominee  for  NASA  Administrator  has  played  a
leadership role in technology transfer issues throughout his career, including
his membership on the NAPA panel, which reviewed the technology transfer
programs at NASA.

2. Relocation:  The  Agency  elected  to  place  the  Technology  Transfer  program  in
the  IPP  Office  within  the  Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate  (ESMD).
The  rationale  for  this  move  was  to  make  Technology  Transfer  an  integral
part  of  the  technology  maturation  process,  engaging  the  private  sector  on  a
broader  level  in  the  Exploration  Vision.  The  Technology  Transfer  efforts
along with the SBIR and STTR programs will continue to support the entire
Agency’s needs.

3. Mission  Directorates  Responsible  for  Spin-In:  Upon  receipt  of  the  NAPA  re-
port, ESMD transmitted it to the other Mission Directorates, indicating that
in the coming year, there would be a series of dialogues between the IPP of-
fice  and  Mission  Directorate  staffs.  The  purpose  of  these  dialogues  would  be
to  determine  the  proper  approach  in  meeting  the  recommendation.  Spin-in,
or  Technology  Infusion,  is  an  integral  part  of  the  ESMD  mission;  it  also  is
for  the  Aeronautics  Research  Mission  Directorate,  which  has  established  its
own  partnerships  function  for  spin-in.  We  expect  similar  results  with  the
other Mission Directorates during the coming months.

4. Center Directors Responsible for Spin-Out: Upon receipt of the NAPA report,
ESMD  transmitted  it  to  the  NASA  Field  Center  Directors,  calling  attention
in particular to four of the eight recommendations that would require Center
attention  and  asking  the  Centers  to  address  those  recommendations.  The
IPP  office  will  be  working  with  its  Center  counter-parts  in  addressing  these
recommendations.  As  part  of  this,  the  IPP  instituted  formal  work  package
agreements  with  each  of  the  Centers  which  established  performance  goals
and standards for the IPP program elements.

5. Restructure  External  Network:  NASA’s  Technology  Transfer  Element  is
streamlining its External Network competitively awarding this function to a
single  contractor  managed  from  Headquarters.  A  draft  Statement  of  Work
has been completed. A contract should be awarded by late summer.

6. Web  Sites  &  Information  Systems:  A  new  contract  for  the  National  Tech-
nology  Transfer  System  (TechTracS)  has  just  been  selected;  working  in  col-
laboration  with  the  ESMD  and  Agency  Information  Technology  personnel
and  Strategic  Communications  Office,  the  web  sites  will  be  consistent  with
agency policies and directives as well as satisfying the recommendation made
by NAPA. Other improvements to the information system are also underway,
also consistent with the NAPA recommendation.

7. Intellectual Property Processing: This recommendation is being worked joint-
ly between the Office of General Counsel (OGC) and IPP; the competitive se-
lection  of  a  central  external  network  contractor  (item  #5)  will  also  address
this recommendation. OGC and IPP are in general agreement, and it is rec-
ognized  that  a  number  of  processes  will  be  affected  and  improved  when  the
new contract is completed.

8. Rigorous  Management:  Program  plans  are  being  finalized,  task  agreements
are  in  place  with  all  Centers,  and  regular  quarterly  program  reviews  are
being  conducted,  the  budget  and  program  planning  are  more  fully  coordi-
nated, and stronger centralized management controls are being put in place.
The  role  of  the  IPP  leadership  team  has  been  strengthened  and  has  become
more  focused  on  strategic  planning,  long-range  goals,  and  annual  objectives
with targets and measurable results.

Q3. Please  provide  the  funding  profile  for  NASA’s  Space  Grant  fellowship  program
for the years FY 2004–2010. What is the reason for the reduction in funding for
the Space Grant program after FY 2006?

The  budget  for  NASA’s  Office  of  Education  beyond  FY  2006  decreases  slightly,
consistent with the government-wide effort to reduce the deficit. During the last few
years,  NASA’s  Office  of  Education  conducted  formal  assessments  of  its  education
programs,  eliminating  or  restructuring  those  programs  determined  to  be  less  effi-
cient  and  effective.  To  accommodate  the  new  lower  planning  level  for  FY  2007  and
beyond,  and  having  already  eliminated  many  less  effective  programs,  it  was  nec-
essary  to  reduce  the  planning  amounts  for  remaining  Education  programs  and
projects, including Space Grant. During the FY 2007 budget cycle, we expect to reas-
sess  all  program  budgets,  including  the  Space  Grant  budget,  to  better  identify  re-
source  needs.  The  FY  2007  budget  request  will  reflect  the  results  of  this  reassess-
ment.

Questions submitted by Representative Michael T. McCaul
Q1. I  am  happy  to  see  that  NASA  is  making  headway  in  meeting  the  recommenda-
tions  of  the  Columbia  Accident  Investigation  Board,  and  aims  to  return  the
Shuttle  to  flight  as  early  as  May  or  June  of  this  year.  Do  you  see  any  specific
reason  that  NASA  would  not  reach  its  goal  of  May–June  for  a  return  flight  to
space?

A1. All  major  Space  Shuttle  flight  hardware  is  at  the  Kennedy  Space  Center  in
Florida  and  is  being  processed  through  a  normal  pre-launch  flow.  Meanwhile,  the
independent  Return-to-Flight  Task  Group  (RTFTG)  continues  to  assess  NASA’s  ef-
forts  to  meet  the  fifteen  Return-to-Flight  recommendations  made  by  the  Columbia
Accident Investigation Board (CAIB). The RTFTG met in plenary session on March
29–31, 2005 to consider the remaining open CAIB Return-to-Flight activities. In the
words  of  RTFTG  co-chair  Richard  Covey,  ‘‘Right  now,  we  don’t  see  anything  that
stands in front of the Agency that can’t be accomplished in order to make the May–
June [2005] launch window.’’

Nevertheless,  this  and  all  future  flights  will  be  driven  by  safety  milestones.  If
there  is  any  indication  that  additional  work  needs  to  be  done  to  meet  those  mile-
stones,  then  the  Space  Shuttle  program  will  take  whatever  measures  are  appro-
priate  to  ensure  that  those  milestones  are  met—up  to  and  including  delaying
launches, if necessary.
Q2. The  phase-out  date  of  the  Space  Shuttle,  corresponding  with  the  completion  of
the  International  Space  Station,  is  slated  for  sometime  in  2010,  and  the  Crew
Exploration  Vehicle  (CEV)  is  not  expected  to  carry  humans  into  space  until
2014.  Will  there  be  no  manned  flights  by  NASA  between  2010  and  2014,  and
is there a possibility that the CEV could be ready sooner?

A2. It  is  important  to  note  that  the  President’s  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  called
for the Crew Exploration Vehicle to be ready no later than 2014. Administrator Grif-
fin  has  stated  his  determination  to  endeavor  to  have  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle
ready earlier than 2014, thus reducing any potential ‘‘gap.’’

The current schedule for CEV calls for risk reduction demonstrations in 2008, fol-
lowed  by  uncrewed  full  up  vehicle  tests  commencing  in  2011.  It  is  anticipated  that

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:07 Sep 19, 2005 Jkt 098564 PO 00000 Frm 00112 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021705\98564 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

109

Exploration Systems Mission Directorate’s (ESMD) current acquisition plan will re-
sult  in  the  first  crewed  flight  of  the  CEV  in  2014.  In  the  interim  between  Shuttle
retirement  in  2010  and  the  first  crewed  flight  of  the  CEV,  NASA  Astronauts  will
continue  to  conduct  human  research  activity  on  the  International  Space  Station
with transportation provided by the Soyuz, and potentially other vehicles.

In  response  to  the  question  of  whether  the  CEV  could  be  ready  sooner,  currently
CEV  development  is  paced  by  the  maturity  of  technology  and  the  demonstration  of
a  reliable  human  rated  launch  system,  both  of  which  are  constrained  by  available
resources. ESMD is initiating a six-month study to determine potential CEV sched-
ule acceleration and the concurrent impact in performance, cost and risk. While pre-
liminary  indications  are  that  the  CEV  development  could  be  accelerated,  impacts
relative  to  additional  costs,  performance,  program  risks,  and  what  actual  schedule
acceleration  can  be  achieved  will  have  to  be  determined—particularly  with  respect
to the human rated launch system requirement. It is unlikely that CEV deployment
could occur as early as 2010, when the Shuttle will be retired.
